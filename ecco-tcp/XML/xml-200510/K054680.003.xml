<HEAD>ANECDOTES of PAINTING, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Painters in the Reign of Charles II.</HEAD>
<P>THE arts were in a manner expelled with the Royal Family
from Britain. The anecdotes of a Civil War are the history
of Destruction. In all ages the mob have vented their hatred
to Tyrants, on the pomp of Tyranny. The magnificence the people
have envied, they grow to detest, and mistaking consequences for
causes, the first objects of their fury are the palaces of their masters.
If Religion is thrown into the quarrel, the most innocent arts are cata∣logued
with sins. This was the case in the contests between Charles
and his parliament. As he had blended affection to the sciences with
a lust of power, nonsense and ignorance were adopted into the liber∣ties
of the subject. Painting became idolatry; monuments were
deemed carnal pride, and a venerable cathedral seemed equally contra∣dictory
to Magna Charta and the Bible. Learning and wit were con∣strued
to be so heathen, that one would have thought the Holy Ghost
could endure nothing above a pun. What the fury of Henry VIII.
had spared, was condemned by the Puritans: Ruin was their harvest,
and they gleaned after the Reformers. Had they countenanced any
of the softer arts, what could those arts have represented? How pictu∣resque
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
was the figure of an Anabaptist? But sectaries have no osten∣sible
enjoyments; their pleasures are private, comfortable and gross.
The arts that civilize society are not calculated for men who mean to
rise on the ruins of established order. Jargon and austerities are the
weapons that best serve the purposes of heresiarcs and innovators. The
sciences have been excommunicated from the Gnostics to Mr.
Whitfield.</P>
<P>The restoration of royalty brought back the arts, not taste. Charles
II. had a turn to mechanics, none to the politer sciences. He had
learned <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See before, vol. ii. p. 109.</NOTE> to draw in his youth; in the imperial library at Vienna is
a view of the isle of Jersey, designed by him; but he was too indo∣lent
even to amuse himself. He introduced the fashions of the court
of France, without it's elegance. He had seen Louis XIV. counte∣nance
Corneille, Moliere, Boileau, Le Sueur, who forming themselves
on the models of the ancients, seemed by the purity of their writings
to have studied only in <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It has been objected by some persons that the expression of <HI>studying in Sparta</HI> is improper, as the Spartans were an illiterate people and produced no authors. A Criticism I think very ill-founded. The purity of the French writers, not their learning, is the object of the text. Many men travelled to La∣cedaemon to study the laws and institutions of Lycurgus. Men visit all countries, under the pretence at least of studying the respective manners: nor have I ever heard before that the term <HI>studying</HI> was restricted to meer reading. When I say an author wrote as chastly as if he had studied only in Sparta, is it not evident that I meaned his morals, not his information, were formed on the purest models?</NOTE> Sparta. Charles found as much genius at
home, but how licentious, how indelicate was the style he permitted or
demanded! Dryden's tragedies, are a compound of bombast and he∣roic
obscenity, inclosed in the most beautiful numbers. If Wycherley
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
had nature, it is nature stark naked. The painters of that time veiled
it but little more; Sir Peter Lely scarce saves appearances but by a bit
of fringe or embroidery. His nymphs, generally reposed on the turf,
are too wanton and too magnificent to be taken for any thing but
maids of honour. Yet fantastic as his compositions seem, they were
pretty much in the dress of the times, as is evident by a puritan tract
published in 1678, and intituled, "Just and reasonable Reprehen∣sions
of naked Breasts and Shoulders." The court had gone a good
way beyond the fashion of the preceding reign, when the galantry in
vogue was to wear a lock of some favorite object; and yet Prynne had
thought that mode so damnable, that he published an absurd piece
against it, called, The Unloveliness of Love-locks <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At the sale of the late lady Worseley, was the portrait of the duchess of So∣merset, daughter of Robert earl of Essex, [Q. Elizabeth's favorite] with a lock of her father's hair hanging on her neck; and the lock itself was in the same auction.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The sectaries, in opposition to the king, had run into the extreme
against politeness: The new court, to indemnify themselves and mark
aversion to their rigid adversaries, took the other extreme. Elegance
and delicacy were the point from which both sides started different
ways; and taste was as little sought by the men of wit, as by those
who called themselves the men of God. The latter thought that to
demolish was to reform; the others, that ridicule was the only rational
corrective; and thus while one party destroyed all order, and the
other gave a loose to disorder, no wonder the age produced scarce any
work of art, that was worthy of being preserved by posterity, Yet
in a history of the arts, as in other histories, the times of confusion and
barbarism must have their place to preserve the connection, and to
ascertain the ebb and flow of genius. One likes to see through what
<PB N="4" REF="5" MS="y"/>
clouds broke forth the age of Augustus. The pages that follow will
present the reader with few memorable names; the number must
atone for merit, if that can be thought any atonement. The first <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vertue was told by old Mr. Laroon, who saw him in Yorkshire, that the celebrated Rembrandt was in England in 1661, and lived 16 or 18 months at Hull, where he drew several gentlemen and seafaring persons. Mr. Dahl had one of those pictures. There are two fine whole lengths at Yarmouth, which might be done at the same time. As there is no other evidence of Rembrandt being in England, it was not necessary to make a seperate article for him, espe∣cially at a time when he is so well known, and his works in such repute, that his scratches, with the difference only of a black horse or a white one, sell for thirty guineas.</NOTE>
person who made any figure, and who was properly a remnant of a
better age, was</P>
<P>ISAAC FULLER,</P>
<P>Of his family or masters, I find no account, except that he studied
many years in France under Perrier, who engraved the antique
statues. Graham says "he wanted the regular improvements of
travel to consider the antiques, and understood the anatomic part of
painting, perhaps equal to Michael Angelo, following it so close,
that he was very apt to make the muscelling too strong and promi∣nent."
But this writer was not aware that the very fault he objects
to Fuller did not proceed from not having seen the antiques, but from
having seen them too partially, and that he was only to be compa∣red
to Michael Angelo from a similitude of errors, flowing from a
similitude of study. Each caught the robust style from ancient statu∣ary,
without attaining it's graces. If Graham had avoided hyperbole,

<FIGURE>
<PB REF="6"/>
<HEAD>ISAAC FULLER.</HEAD>
<P>Ipse pinx. T.Chambars sculp</P>

<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
he had not fallen into a blunder. In his historic compositions Fuller
is a wretched painter, his colouring was raw and unnatural, and not
compensated by disposition or invention. In portraits his pencil was
bold, strong, and masterly: Men who shine in the latter, and miscarry
in the former, want imagination. They succeed only in what they see.
Liotard is a living instance of this sterility. He cannot paint a blue
ribband if a lady is dressed in purple knots. If he had been in the
prison at the death of Socrates, and the passions were as permanent as
the persons on whom they act, he might have made a finer picture
than Nicolò Poussin.</P>
<P>Graham speaks of Fuller as extravagant and burlesque in his man∣ners,
and says, that they influenced the style of his works <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Elsum in an epigram, that is not one of his worst, agrees with this opinion;
On a drunken Sot,
His head does on his shoulder lean,
His eyes are sunk and hardly seen;
Who sees this sot in his own colour
Is apt to say, 'twas done by Fuller.</NOTE>. The
former character seems more true than the latter. I have a picture
of Ogleby by him, in which he certainly has not debased his subject,
but has made Ogleby appear a moonstruck bard, instead of a con∣temptible
one. The composition has more of Salvator than of Brau∣wer.
His own <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It is much damaged, and was given to the University by Dr. Clarke.</NOTE> portrait in the gallery at Oxford is capricious, but
touched with great force and character. His altar-pieces at <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mr. Addison wrote a latin poem in praise of it.</NOTE> Mag∣dalen
and All-souls colleges in Oxford are despicable. At Wadham
college is an altar-cloth in a singular manner, and of merit: It is just
brushed over for the lights and shades, and the colours melted in with
a hot iron. He painted too the inside of St. Mary Abchurch in Canon-street.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="8" MS="y"/>
While Fuller was at Oxford he drew several portraits, and copied
Dobson's decollation of St. John, but varying the faces from real per∣sons.
For Herodias, who held the charger, he painted his own mis∣tress;
her mother for the old woman receiving the head in a bag, and
the ruffian, who cut it off, was a noted bruiser of that age. There was
besides a little boy with a torch, which illuminated the whole picture.
Fuller received 60 pieces for it. In king James's catalogue is men∣tioned
a picture by him, representing Fame and Honour treading
down Envy. Colonel Seymour <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vertue bought it, and from his sale I purchased it.</NOTE> had a head of Pierce, the carver,
by Fuller. He was much employed to paint the great taverns <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sir P. Lely seeing a portrait of Norris, the king's frame-maker, an old grey-headed man, finely painted by Fuller, lamented that such a genius should drown his talents in wine.</NOTE> in
London; particularly the mitre in Fenchurch-street, where he adorn∣ed
all the sides of a great room in pannels, as was then the fashion.
The figures were as large as life; a Venus, Satyr and sleeping Cupid;
a boy riding a goat and another fallen down, over the chimney; this
was the best part of the performance, says Vertue; Saturn devouring
a child, Mercury, Minerva, Diana, Apollo; and Bacchus, Venus, and
Ceres embracing; a young Silenus fallen down, and holding a goblet,
into which a boy was pouring wine; the seasons between the win∣dows,
and on the ceiling two angels supporting a mitre, in a large
circle; this part was very bad, and the colouring of the Saturn too
raw, and his figure too muscular. He painted five very large pictures,
the history of the king's escape after the battle of Worcester; they
cost a great sum, but were little esteemed.</P>
<P>Vertue had seen two books with etchings by Fuller; the first, Caesar
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
Ripa's Emblems; some of the plates by Fuller, others by Henry
Cooke and Tempesta. The second was called, Libro da Disegnare;
8 or 10 of the plates by our painter.</P>
<P>He died in Bloomsbury-square, July 17, 1672, and left a son, an in∣genious
but idle man, according to Vertue, chiefly employed in coach-painting.
He led a dissolute life and died young.</P>
<P>Fuller had one Scholar, Charles Woodfield; who entered under him
at Oxford, and served seven years. He generally painted views,
buildings, monuments, and antiquities, but being as idle as his mas∣ter's
son, often wanted necessaries. He died suddenly in his chair in
the year 1724, at the age of 75.</P>
<P>CORNELIUS BOLL,</P>
<P>A painter of whom I find no particulars, but that he made views of
London before the fire, which proves that he was here early in this
reign if not in the last; these views were at Sutton-place in Surrey,
and represented Arundel-house, Somerset-house and the Tower.
Vertue, who saw them, says, they were in a good free taste.</P>
<P>JOHN FREEMAN,</P>
<P>An historic painter, was a rival of Fuller, which seems to have been
his greatest glory. He was thought to have been poisoned in the
West-indies, but however died in England, after having been em∣ployed
in painting scenes for the theatre in Covent-garden <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Graham p. 419.</NOTE>.

</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10" MS="y"/>REMÈE or REMIGIUS VAN LEMPUT,</P>
<P>Was born at Antwerp, and arrived at some excellence by copying
the works of Vandyck; he imitated too with success the Flemish
masters, as Stone did the Italians; and for the works of Lely, Remèe
told that master that he could copy them better than Sir Peter could
himself. I have already mentioned his small picture from Holbein,
of the two Henrys and their queens, and that his purchase in king
Charles's sale of the king on horseback was taken from him, by a suit
at law, after he had demanded 1500 guineas for it at Antwerp and
been bid 1000. The earl of Pomfret at Easton had a copy of Ra∣phael's
Galatea by him, and at Penshurst is a small whole length of
Francis earl of Bedford aet. 48, 1636, from Vandyck. Mr. Stevens,
historiographer to the king, had some portraits of his family painted
by Remèe. The latter had a well-chosen collection of prints and
drawings <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Graham, p. 458.</NOTE>. He died in Nov. 1675, and was buried in the church-yard
of Covent-garden, as his son Charles had been in 1651. His daughter
was a paintress, and married to Thomas, brother of</P>
<P>ROBERT STREATER,</P>
<P>Who was appointed serjeant painter at the restoration. He was the
son of a painter and born in Covent-garden, 1624, and studied under
Du Moulin. Streater did not confine himself to any branch of his art,
but succeeded best in architecture, perspective, landscape and still life.
Graham calls him the greatest and most universal painter that ever

<FIGURE>

</FIGURE>
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
England bred, but with about as much judgment, as where he says
that Streater's being a good historian contributed not a little to his
perfection in that way of painting. He might as well say that read∣ing
the Rape of the Lock would make one a good hair-cutter. I
should rely more on Sanderson, who speaking of landscape, says "of
our own nation I know none more excellent but Streater, who indeed
is a compleat master therein, as also in other arts of etching, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He engraved a plate of the battle of Naseby. The plates for Sir Robert Stapleton's Juvenal were designed by Streater, Barlow and Danckers.</NOTE> graving,
and his work of architecture and perspective; not a line but is true to
the rules of art and symmetry <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Graphice, p, 19.</NOTE>." And again, comparing our own
countrymen with foreigners, in different branches, he adds, "Streater
in all paintings <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ib. 20.</NOTE>." But from the few works that I have seen of his
hand, I can by no means subscribe to these encomiums: The Theatre
at Oxford, his principal performance, is a very mean one; yet Streater
was as much commended for it, as by the authors I have mentioned
for his works in general. One Robert Whitehall <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">V. Wood's Athenae, vol. ii. p. 786. A description in prose of that paint∣ing is in the new Oxford-guide.</NOTE>, a poetaster of
that age, wrote a poem called Urania, or a description of the painting
at the top of the Theatre at Oxford, which concluded with these lines,<Q><L>That future ages must confess they owe</L>
<L>To Streater more than Michael Angelo.</L></Q>At Oxford Streater painted too the chapel at All-souls, except the
Resurrection, which is the work of Sir James Thornhill. Vertue
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
saw a picture, which he commends, of a Dr. Prujean <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vertue met with a print, Opinion sitting in a tree, thus inscribed, Viro clariss. Dno. Francisco Prujeano, Medico, omnium bonarum artium &amp; eleganti∣arum Fautori &amp; admiratori summo. D. D. D. H. Peacham.</NOTE>, in his gown
and long hair, one hand on a death's head, and the other on some
books, with this inscription, Amicitiae ergo pinxit Rob. Streater: And
in the possession of a captain Streater, the portrait of Robert by him∣self,
of his brother Thomas, by Lankrink; and of Thomas's wife,
the daughter of Remèe, by herself. Vertue had also seen two letters,
directed to serjeant Streater at his house in Long-acre; the first from
the <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This was earl Philip, mentioned in the Memoires de Grammont. He was very handsome, and had remarkably fine hair. Lord Harrington has a good head of him by Sir Peter Lely, in which these circumstances are observed.</NOTE> earl of Chesterfield dated june 13, 1678, mentioning a picture
of Mutius Scaevola, for which he had paid him 20<HI>l.</HI> and offering him
160<HI>l,</HI> if he would paint six small pictures with figures. His lordship
commends too the story of Rinaldo, bought of Streater, but wishes
the idea of the Hero had been taken from the duke of Monmouth or
some very handsome man. The other letter was from the <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The famous George lord Digby. There is at Althrop a suit of arras with his arms, which he gave to his daughter the countess of Sunderland, whom I mention to rectify a common blunder: It is the portrait of this lady, Anne Digby, who had light hair and a large square face, that is among the beauties at Windsor, and not her mother-in-law Sacharissa, who had a round face, and dark hair, and who probably was no beauty in the reign of Charles II.</NOTE> earl of

Cornhill, and all the scenes at the old playhouse. He died in 1680,
at the age of 56 not long after being cut for the stone, though Charles
II. had so much kindness for him as to send for a surgeon from Paris
to perform the operation. He had a good collection of Italian books,
prints, drawings and pictures, which, on the death of his son in 1711,
were sold by auction. Among them were the following by Streater
himself, which at least show the universality of his talent; Lacy the
player; a hen and chickens; two heads; an eagle; a landscape
and flowers; a large pattern of the king's arms; Isaac and Re∣becca;
fruit-pieces; Abraham and Isaac; the nativity; Jacob's vision;
Mary Magdalen; building and figures; two dogs. They sold, says
Vertue, for no great price; some for five pounds, some for ten.</P>
<P>HENRY ANDERTON <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">V. Graham.</NOTE>,</P>
<P>Was disciple of Streater, whose manner he followed in landscape and
still life. Afterwards he travelled to Italy, and at his return took to
portrait-painting, and having drawn the famous Mrs. Stuart, duchess
of Richmond, he was employed by the king and court, and even in∣terfered
with the business of Sir Peter Lely. Anderton died soon
after the year 1665.</P>
<P>FRANCIS VANSON, or VANZOON,</P>
<P>Was born at Antwerp, and learned of his father, a flower painter,
but he came early into England, and marrying Streater's neice suc∣ceeded
to much of her uncle's business. Vertue and Graham com∣mend
<PB N="12" REF="16"/>
the freedom of his pencil, but his subjects were ill-chosen.
He painted still-life, oranges and lemons, plate, damask curtains,
cloths of gold, and that medley of familiar objects that strike the
ignorant vulgar. In Streater's sale, mentioned above, were near thirty
of Vanson's pieces, which sold well; among others, was the crown of
England, and birds in water-colours. Vanson's patron was the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charles Bodville Robartes, second earl of Radnor, who succeeded his grand∣father in 1684, and was lord warden of the stanneries, and by king George I. made treasurer of the chambers. He died in 1723.</NOTE>
earl of Radnor, who at his house in St. James's square, had near
eighteen or twenty of his works, over doors and chimnies, &amp;c.
there was one large piece, loaded with fruit, flowers, and dead game
by him, and his own portrait in it, painted by Laguerre, with a
hawk on his fist. The stair-case of that house was painted by La∣guerre,
and the apartments were ornamented by the principal artists
then living, as Edema, Wyck, Roestraten, Danckers, old Griffier,
young Vandevelde and Sybrecht. The collection <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In this sale were some capital pictures, as Rubens and his mistress (I suppose it should be his wife, and that it is the picture at Blenheim) sold for 130 guineas; the martyrdom of St. Laurence by Vandyck, 65 guineas; a satyr with a woman milking a goat by Jordan of Antwerp, 160 guineas; and the family piece, which I have mentioned in the life of Vandyck, bought by Mr. Scawen for 500 <HI>l.</HI></NOTE> was sold in 1724.
Some of his pictures were eight or nine feet high, and in them he
proposed to introduce all the medicinal plants in the physic garden
at Chelsea, but grew tired of the undertaking, before he had com∣pleated
it. He lived chiefly in Long-acre, and lastly in St. Alban's-street,
where he died in the year 1700, at past fifty years of age.

</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="17"/>SAMUEL VAN HOOGSTRATEN,</P>
<P>Was another of those painters of still life, a manner at that time in
fashion. It was not known that he had been in England, till Vertue
discovered it by a picture of his hand at a sale in Covent-garden 1730.
The ground represented a walnut-tree board, with papers, pens, pen∣knife
and an English almanack of the year 1663, a gold medal, and
the portrait of the author in a supposed ebony frame, long hair in∣clining
to red, and his name, S. V. Hoogstraten. The circumstance
of the English almanack makes it probable that this painter was in
England at least in that year, and Vertue found it confirmed by Hou∣braken
his scholar, who in his lives <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is also an account of him in the second volume of Descamps, which was published but a little time before the death of Vertue.</NOTE> of the painters says, that Hoog∣straten
was born at Dordrecht in 1627, was first instructed by his fa∣ther,
and then by Rembrandt. That he painted in various kinds,
particularly small portraits, and was countenanced by the emperor and
king of Hungary. That he travelled to Italy, and came to England;
that he was author of a book on painting, called Zichtbare Waerelt
geselt worden, and died at Dordrecht in 1678.</P>
<P>BALTHAZAR VAN LEMENS,</P>
<P>Was among the first that came over after the restoration, when a re∣established
court promised the revival of arts, and consequently advan∣tage
to artists, but the poor man was as much disappointed as if he
had been useful to the court in it's depression. He was born at An∣twerp
<PB N="14" REF="18"/>
in 1637, and is said <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Graham. A head of Charles I. by one Lemons is mentioned in that king's collection p. 72. Whether the father of this person, or whether a different name, as there is a slight variation in the orthography, I do not know.</NOTE> to have succeeded in small histories; but
not being encouraged, and having a fruitful invention and easy pencil,
his best profit was making sketches for others of his profession. He
lived to 1704, and was buried in Westminster. His brother, who
resided at Brussels, painted a head of him.</P>
<P>ABRAHAM HONDIUS,</P>
<P>Was born at Rotterdam in 1638: when he came to England or who
was his master is not known. His manner indeed seems his own; it
was bold and free, and except Rubens and Snyder, few masters have
painted animals in so great a style. Though he drew both figures
and landscape, dogs and huntings were his favorite subjects. Vertue
says he was a man of humour, and that one of his maxims was, that
the goods of other men might be used as our own; and that finding
another man's wife of the same mind, he took and kept her till she
died; after which he married. He lived on Ludgate-hill, but died
of a severe course of the gout in 1695, at the blackmore's head over-against
Water-lane Fleet-street. One of his first pictures was the
burning of Troy; and he frequently painted candle-lights. His
best was a dog-market, sold at Mr. Halsted's auction in 1726: Above
on steps were men and women well executed. My father had two
large pieces of his hand, the one a boar, the other a stag-hunting,
very capital. Vertue mentions besides a landscape painted in 1666;
Diana returned from hunting, and a bull-baiting, dated 1678.</P>

Jodocus Hondius, probably the grand-father of Abraham, had
been in England before, and was an engraver of maps. He execu∣ted
some of Speed's, and <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">V. British Librarian.</NOTE> one of the voyages of Thomas Cavendish
and Sir Francis Drake round the globe. He also engraved a genea∣logic
chart of the houses of York and Lancaster, with the arms of the
knights of the garter to the year 1589, drawn by Thomas Talbot;
a map of the Roman empire; another of the Holy-land, and particu∣larly
the celestial and terrestrial globes, the largest that had then ever
been printed. I shall say nothing more of him in this place (as the
catalogue of English engravers I reserve for a seperate volume) but
that he left a son Henry, born in London, whom I take for the father
of Abraham Hondius, and who finished several things that had been
left imperfect by Jodocus.</P>
<P>Mr. WILLIAM LIGHTFOOT <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Graham.</NOTE>,</P>
<P>An English painter of perspective, landscape and architecture, in
which last science he practiced too, having some share in the Royal-exchange. He died about 1671.</P>
<P>Sir PETER LELY,</P>
<P>Not only the most capital painter of this reign, but whose works are
admitted amongst the classics of the art, was born at Soest in West∣phalia,
where his father, a captain of Foot, was in garrison. His
name was Vander Vaas, but being born at the Hague in a perfumer's
shop, the sign of the Lilly, he received the appellation of captain Du
<PB N="16" REF="22" MS="y"/>
Lys or Lely, which became the proper name of the son. He re∣ceived
his first instructions in painting from one De Grebber, and
began with landscape and historic figures less than life; but coming
to England in 1641, and seeing the works of Vandyck, he quitted
his former style and former subjects, and gave himself wholly to
portraits in emulation of that great man. His success was consi∣derable,
though not equal to his ambition; if in nothing but simpli∣city,
he fell short of his model, as Statius or Claudian did of Virgil.
If Vandyck's portraits are often tame and spiritless, at least they are
natural. His laboured draperies flow with ease, and not a fold but
is placed with propriety. Lely supplied the want of taste with clin∣quant;
his nymphs trail fringes and embroidery through meadows
and purling streams. Add, that Vandyck's habits are those of the
times; Lely's a sort of fantastic night-gowns, fastened with a single
pin <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Your night-gown fasten'd with a single pin;</L>

own country. Sir Peter had disgusts of the same kind from Simon
Varelst, patronized by the duke of Buckingham; from Gascar who
was brought over by the duchess of Portsmouth; and from the rising
merit of Kneller, whom the French author I have mentioned, sets
with little reason far below Sir Peter. Both had too little variety in
airs of heads; Kneller was bolder and more careless, Lely more de∣licate
in finishing. The latter showed by his pains how high he could

arrive: It is plain that if Sir Godfrey had painted much less and ap∣plied
more, he would have been the greater master. This perhaps
is as true a parallel, as the French author's, who thinks that Kneller
might have disputed with Lely in the beauty of his head of hair.
Descamps is so weak as to impute Sir Peter's death to his jealousy of
Kneller, though he owns it was almost sudden; an account which is
almost nonsense, especially as he adds that Lely's physician, who knew
not the cause of his malady, heightened it by repetitions of Kneller's

to draw his wife's picture, and stood behind him while he drew it.
The improbability of this tale is heightened by an anecdote which
Walton told Vertue; or if true, Sir Peter's generosity appears the
greater, he settling forty pounds a year on Greenhill's widow, who
was left with several Children and in great indigence. She was a very
handsome Woman; but did not long enjoy that bounty, dying mad
in a short time after her husband.</P>

the boy for a monk, but his inclination to painting discovering itself
early, he was permitted to follow his genius. His best lessons he
obtained in the academy at Antwerp, and from the collection of
Mynheer Van Lyan. The youth made a good choice, chiefly draw∣ing
after the designs of Salvator Rosa. On his mother's death, from
whom he inherited a small fortune, he came to England, and was pa∣tronized
by Sir Edward Spragge, and Sir William Williams, whose
house was filled with his works; but being burned down, not much
remains of Lankrink's hand, he having passed great part of his time
in that gentleman's service. His landscapes are much commended.
Sir Peter Lely employed him for his back-grounds, A single ceiling
of his was at Mr. Kent's at Causham, in Wiltshire near Bath. He
sometimes drew from the life, and imitated the manner of Titian, in
small figures for his landscapes. Some of those were in the hands of
his patrons, Mr. Henly, Mr. Trevor, Mr. Austen, and Mr. Hewitt,
the latter of whom had a good collection of pictures. So had Lan∣krink
himself, and of drawings, prints and models. He bought
much at Lely's sale, for which he borrowed Money of Mr. Austen; to
discharge which debt Lankrink's collection was seized after his death
and sold. He went deep into the pleasures of that age, grew idle and
died in 1692 in Covent-garden, and was buried at his own request

upon the restoration he was employed by Sir Peter Lely to paint his

the same business under Riley and Sir Godfrey Kneller. He drew
well, and made good designs for tapestry. The portrait of Charles
II. in Painter's-hall, and another of the same prince, with mathema∣tical

the Prebendaries of Westminster, was born in St. Martin's-lane,
London, a little before the restoration. Her family was remarkable
for it's loyalty, accomplishments, and wit, and this young lady pro∣mised
<PB N="26" REF="34"/>
to be one of it's fairest ornaments. Antony Wood says she was
a grace for beauty, and a muse for wit. Dryden has celebrated her
genius for painting and poetry in a very long ode, in which the rich
stream of his numbers has hurried along with it all that his luxuriant
fancy produced in his way; it is an harmonious hyperbole composed
of the fall of Adam, Arethusa, Vestal Virgins, Diana, Cupid, Noah's∣ark,
the Pleiades, the valley of Jehosaphat and the last Assizes: Yet
Antony Wood assures us "there is nothing spoken of her, which she
was not equal to, if not superior;" and his proof is as wise as his
assertion, for, says he, "if there had not been more true history in
her praises, than compliment, her father would never have suffered
them to pass the press." She was maid of honour to the duchess of
York, and died of the small-pox in 1685, in the 25th year of her
age.</P>
<P>Her poems were published after her death in a thin quarto, with a
print of her, taken from her portrait drawn by herself, which, with
the leave of the authors I have quoted, is in a much better style than
her poetry, and evidently in the manner of Sir Peter Lely. She drew
the pictures of James II. and of her mistress, Mary of Modena; some
pieces of still-life and of history; three of the latter she has recorded
in her own poems, St. John in the wilderness, Herodias with the
head of that saint, and two of Diana's nymphs. At admiral Killi∣grew's

Adonis; a Satyr playing on a pipe; Judith and Holofernes; a wo∣man's

Sueur and Le Brun, the latter of whom advised him to adhere to
portraits for which he had a particular talent. The French author <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Abregè de la Vie des plus fameux Peintres, vol. ii. p. 329.</NOTE>,
from whom I transcribe, says that in that style he equalled the best
masters of that country, and that passing into England he was
reckoned a second Vandyck. If he was thought so then, it is entirely
forgotten. Both Graham and Vertue knew so little of him, that the
first mentions him not, and the latter confounded him with Valentine
Le Fevre of Brussels, who never was here; yet mentions a mezzo∣tint
of Alexandre Boudan imprimeur du roi, done at Paris by Sarabe,
the eyes of which were printed in blue and the face and hands in flesh-colour.
From hence I conclude that Graham made another mistake
in his account of</P>
<P>LE FEVRE DE VENISE,</P>
<P>Whose christian name was Roland, and who he says gained the favour
of prince Rupert by a secret of staining marble. As that prince in∣vented
mezzotinto, I conclude it was Claude who learned it of his
highness, during his intercourse with him, and communicated it to
Sarabe at Paris. Le Fevre de Venise certainly was in England and
died here, as Claude did. Vertue says that his Le Fevre painted
chiefly portraits and histories in small, in the manner of Vandyck,
the latter of which were not always very decent. As I am desirous of
adjusting the pretensions of the three Le Fevres, and should be un∣willing
to attribute to either of the wrong what his modesty might

<P>Claude died in 1675 at the age of forty-two; Roland died in Bear-street
near Leicester-fields in 1677, about the 69th year of his age,
and was buried at St. Martin's.</P>
<P>Mercier, painter to the late prince of Wales, bought at an auction
the portrait of Le Fevre, in a spotted-furr-cap, with a pallet in his
hand; I suppose painted by himself; and at Burlington-house is the
picture of Rousseau the painter, by Le Fevre; I suppose Roland.</P>
<P>JOHN HAYLS <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">So he writes his name on the portrait of Flatman. In Painter's-hall is a St. Sebastian and a portrait of Mr. Morgan, by one Hayes; as I find no other mention of this man, it may be a mistake for Hayls: so Vertue supposed.</NOTE>,</P>
<P>Remarkable for copying Vandyck well, and for being a rival of Lely.
A portrait of himself in water-colours, purchased by colonel Seymour
at Mr. Bryan's sale, ill drawn but strongly coloured, induced Vertue
to think that Lely was not the only person whom Hayls had an am∣bition
to rival, but that this was a first essay in competition with
Cooper. However I find by a note in a different volume, that some
thought this miniature was by Hoskins. At Woburn is the portrait
of colonel John Russel, (of whom there is a better picture in the Me∣moires
de Grammont) third son of Francis earl of Bedford; and ano∣ther
of lady Diana, second daughter of William the first duke of that
house, both by Hayls, and he drew the father of secretary Pepys. He
lived in Southampton-street Bloomsbury, and dying there suddenly in
1679, was buried in St. Martin's.

</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="43"/>HENRY GASCAR,</P>
<P>Another competitor of Sir Peter, was a French portrait-painter, pa∣tronized
by the duchess of Portsmouth, and in compliment to her
much encouraged. Graham speaks of his tawdry style, which was
more the fault of the age than of the painter. The pomp of Louis
XIV. infected Europe; and Gascar, whose business was to please,
succeeded as well in Italy as he had in England, from whence he car∣ried
above 10,000<HI>l.</HI> At Chesterton Vertue saw a head in armour
of Edmund Verney, with Gascar's name to it. His best performance
was a half length at lord Pomfret's of Philip earl of Pembroke,
which he drew by stealth, by order of his patroness, whose sister
lord Pembroke had married. I suppose this desire of having her
brother-in-law's picture was dated before a quarrel she had with him
for ill-usage of her sister: The duchess threatened to complain to the
king; the earl told her, if she did, he would set her upon her head at
Charing-cross, and show the nation it's grievance.</P>
<P>SIMON VARELST,</P>
<P>A real ornament of Charles's reign, and one of the few who have ar∣rived
at capital excellence in that branch of the art, was a Dutch
flower-painter. It is not certain in what year he arrived in England;
his works were extremely admired, and his prices the greatest that had
been known in this country. The duke of Buckingham patronized
him, but having too much wit to be only beneficent, and perceiving
the poor man to be immoderately vain, he piqued him to attempt
portraits. Varelst thinking nothing impossible to his pencil, fell into
<PB N="34" REF="44"/>
the snare, and drew the duke himself, but crouded it so much with
fruits and sun-flowers, that the king, to whom it was showed, took it
for a flower-piece. However, as it sometimes happens to wiser buf∣foons
than Varelst, he was laughed at till he was admired, and Sir
Peter Lely himself became the real sacrifice to the jest: he lost much
of his business, and retired to Kew, while Varelst engrossed the fashion,
and for one half length was paid an hundred and ten pounds. His
portraits were exceedingly laboured, and finished with the same deli∣cacy
as his flowers, which he continued to introduce into them.
Lord chancellor Shaftsbury going to sit, was received by him with his
hat on. Don't you know me? said the peer. Yes, replied the pain∣ter,
you are my lord chancellor. And do you know me? I am Va∣relst.
The king can make any man chancellor, but he can make no∣body
a Varelst. Shaftsbury was disgusted and sat to Greenhill. In
1680 Varelst, his brother Harman, Henny and Parmentiere, all
painters, went to Paris, but staid not long. In 1685 Varelst was a
witness on the divorce between the duke and duchess of Norfolk;
one who had married Varelst's half sister was brought to set aside his
evidence, and deposed his having been mad and confined. He was
so, but not much more than others of his profession have been; his
lunacy was self-admiration; he called himself the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><L>When fam'd Varelst this little wonder drew,</L>

and went to Whitehall saying he wanted to converse with the king for

two or three hours. Being repulsed, he said, "He is king of
England, I am king of painting, why should not we converse together
familiarly?" He showed an historic piece on which he had laboured
twenty years, and boasted that it contained the several manners and
excellencies of Raphael, Titian, Rubens, and Vandyck. When Va∣relst,
Kneller and Jervase have been so mad with vanity, to what a de∣gree
of phrenzy had Raphael pretensions!—But he was modest.
Varelst was shut up towards the end of his life, but recovered his
senses at last, not his genius, and lived to a great age, certainly as late
as 1710, and died in Suffolk-street. In king James's collection were
six of his hand, the king, queen, and duchess of Portsmouth, half
lengths, a landscape, flowers, and fruit: In lord Pomfret's were nine
flower-pieces.</P>
<P>His brother Harman Varelst lived some time at Vienna, till the
Turks beseiged it in 1683. He painted history, fruit and flowers,
and dying about 1700 was buried in St. Andrew's Holbourn. He
left a son of his profession called Cornelius, and a very accomplished
daughter, who painted in oil, and drew small histories, portraits both
in large and small, understood music, and spoke Latin, German, Ita∣lian,
and other languages.</P>
<P>ANTONIO VERRIO,</P>
<P>A Neapolitan; an excellent painter for the sort of subjects on which
he was employed, that is, without much invention, and with less taste,
his exuberant pencil was ready at pouring our gods, goddesses, kings,
emperors and triumphs, over those public surfaces on which the eye
never rests long enough to criticize, and where one should be sorry to
place the works of a better master, I mean, cielings and stair-cases.
<PB N="36" REF="47" MS="y"/>
The New Testament or the Roman History cost him nothing but
ultra-marine; that and marble columns, and marble steps he never
spared. He first settled in France, and painted the high altar of the
Carmelites at Thoulouse, which is described in Du Puy's Traitè sur la
Peinture, p. 219. Thoul. 1699.</P>
<P>Charles II. having a mind to revive the manufacture of tapestry at
Mortlack, which had been interrupted by the civil war, sent for Verrio
to England; but changing his purpose, consigned over Windsor to
his pencil. The king was induced to this by seeing some of his paint∣ing
at lord Arlington's, at the end of St. James's-park, where at pre∣sent
stands Buckingham-house. The first picture Verrio drew for
the king was his majesty in naval triumph, now in the public dining∣room
in the castle. He executed most of the ceilings there, one whole
side of St. George's-hall, and the chapel. On the ceiling of the form∣er
he has pictured Antony earl of Shaftsbury, in the character of Fac∣tion,
dispersing libels; as in another place he revenged a private quar∣rel
with the house-keeper Mrs. Marriot, by borrowing her ugly face
for one of the furies. With still greater impropriety he has introdu∣ced
himself, Sir Godfrey Kneller, and Bap. May, surveyor of the
works, in long periwigs, as spectators of Christ healing the sick. He
is recorded as operator of all these gawdy works in a large inscription
over the tribune at the end of the hall <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is a description of St. George's-hall in the Musae Anglicanae.</NOTE>;

The king's bounty did not stop here; Verrio had a place of mas∣ter-gardiner,
and a lodging at the end of the park, now Carleton-house.
He was expensive, and kept a great table, and often pressed
the king for money with a freedom which his majesty's own frankness
indulged. Once at Hampton-court, when he had but lately received
an advance of a thousand pounds, he found the king in such a circle
that he could not approach. He called out, Sire, I desire the favour
of speaking to your majesty.—Well, Verrio, said the king, what is
your request? Money, Sir, I am so short in cash, that I am not able
to pay my workmen, and your majesty and I have learned by expe∣rience,
that pedlars and painters cannot give credit long. The king
smiled, and said he had but lately ordered him 1000<HI>l.</HI> Yes, Sir, re∣plied
he, but that was soon paid away, and I have no gold left. At
that rate, said the king, you would spend more than I do, to main∣tain
my family. True, answered Verrio, but does your majesty keep
an open table as I do?</P>
<P>He gave the designs for the large equestrian picture of that monarch
in the hall at Chelsea-college; but it was finished by Cook, and pre∣sented
by lord Ranelagh.</P>
<P>On the accession of James II. Verrio was again employed at Wind∣sor,
in Wolsey's Tomb-house, then destined for a Romish-chapel. He
painted that king and several of his courtiers, in the hospital of
Christ-church London. Among other portraits there is Dr. Hawes,
a physician; Vertue saw the original head from whence he translated
it into the great piece, which Verrio presented to the hospital. He
painted too at that of St. Bartholomew.</P>
<P>The revolution was by no means agreable to Verrio's religion or
principles. He quitted his place, and even refused to work for king
<PB N="39" REF="50" MS="y"/>
William. From that time he was for some years employed at the lord
Exeter's at Burleigh, and afterwards at Chatsworth. At the former
he painted several chambers, which are reckoned among his best
works. He has placed his own portrait in the room where he repre∣sented
the history of Mars and Venus; and for the Bacchus bestriding
a hogshead, he has, according to his usual liberty <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was more excusable, that when his patron obliged him to insert a pope, in a procession not very honorable to the Romish religion, he added the portrait of the archbishop of Canterbury then living.</NOTE>, borrowed the
countenance of a dean, with whom he was at variance. At Chats∣worth
is much of his hand. The altar-piece in the chapel is the best
piece I ever saw of his; the subject, the incredulity of St. Thomas.
He was employed too at Lowther-hall, but the house has been burnt.
At last by persuasion of lord Exeter he condescended to serve king
William, and was sent to Hampton-court, where among other things
he painted the great stair-case, and as ill, as if he had spoiled it out
of principle. His eyes failing him *, queen Anne gave him a pension
of 200<HI>l.</HI> a year for life, but he did not enjoy it long, dying at
Hampton-court in 1707.</P>
<P>Scheffers of Utrecht was employed by Verrio for twenty-five years.
At his first arrival he had worked for picture-sellers. Lanscron was
another painter in Verrio's service, and assisted him seven or eight
years at Windsor.
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It was not only this decay, but his death that prevented his being employed at Blenheim, as probably was intended, for the author of some verses addressed to Verrio in the sixth volume of Dryden's miscellanies, carried his prophetic imagination so far as to behold the duke's triumphs represented there by our painter; who died before the house was built.</NOTE>

</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="51" MS="y"/>JAMES HUYSMAN or HOUSMAN <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Graham.</NOTE></P>
<P>Was born at Antwerp in 1656, and studied under Bakerel, a scholar
of Rubens, and competitor of Vandyck. Bakerel was a poet too,
and a satyric one, and having writ an invective against the Jesuits,
was obliged to fly. Huysman, deprived of his master, came to
England, and painted both history and portraits. In the latter he
rivalled Sir Peter Lely, and with reason. His picture of lady Byron
over the chimney in the beauty-room at Windsor, is at least as highly
finished and coloured with as much force as Sir Peter's works in that
chamber, tho' the <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I find in Vertue's notes that he had been told it is not lady Byron, but lady Bellassis. If it was the lady Bellassis, who was mistress to king James, it becomes more valuable, and while Charles paid his brother the compliment of enrolling the latter's mistress with his own, he tacitly insinuated how much better a taste he had himself. I have an unfinished head by Cooper of king James's lady Bellassis, which is historically plain. Huysman's picture has certainly some resemblance to the mezzotinto of her from Sir Peter Lely.</NOTE> lady who sat for it is the least handsome of the
set. His Cupids were admired; himself was most partial to his pic∣ture
of queen Catherine. There is a mezzotinto from it, representing
her like St. Catherine. King James <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See his catalogue. There too is mentioned the duchess of Richmond in man's apparel by Huysman. It is a pretty picture, now at Kensington: the dress is that of a Cavalier about the time of the civil war, buff with blue ribbands.</NOTE> had another in the dress of a
shepherdess; and there is a third in Painter's-hall. He created
himself the queen's painter, and to justify it, made her sit for every
Madonna or Venus that he drew. His capital work was over the
<PB N="41" REF="52" MS="y"/>
altar of her chapel at St. James's, now the French church. He died
in 1696, and was buried in St. James's-church.</P>
<P>Vertue mentions another painter of the same surname, whom he
calls Michlaer Huysman of Mecklin, and says he lived at Antwerp;
that he studied the Italians, and painted landscapes in their manner,
which he adorned with buildings and animals. He came to England,
and brought two large landscapes, which he kept to shew what he
could do; for these he had frames richly carved by Gibbons, and
gave the latter two pictures in exchange. In a sale in 1743 Vertue
saw three small landscapes and figures by him of great merit. On
the revolution he returned to Antwerp, and died there 1707, aged
near 70.</P>
<P>MICHAEL WRIGHT,</P>
<P>Was born in Scotland, but came to London at the age of 16 or 17,
and proved no bad portrait-painter. In 1672 he drew for Sir Robert
Vyner a whole length of prince Rupert in armour with a large wig.
On the back he wrote the prince's titles at length, and his own name
thus, Jo. Michael Wright Lond. pictor regius pinxit 1672. The earl
of Oxford had a half length by him of Sir Edward Turner, son of
Sir Edward, speaker of the House of Commons and chief baron. On
that he called himself Jos. Michael Wright <HI>Anglus,</HI> 1672, but on the
portraits of the judges in Guildhall he wrote <HI>Scotus.</HI> Sir Peter Lely
was to have drawn these pictures, but refusing to wait on the judges
at their own chambers, Wright got the business, and received 60<HI>l.</HI> for
each piece. Two of his most admired works were a highland laird
and an Irish tory, whole lengths in their proper dresses, of which seve∣ral
<PB N="42" REF="53"/>
copies were made. At Windsor is his large picture of John
Lacy the comedian in three different characters, Parson Scruple in
the Cheats, Sandy in the Taming of the Shrew, and Monsieur de
Vice in the Country Captain. It was painted in 1675, and several
copies taken from it. He twice drew a duke of Cambridge son of
king James <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">V. catalogue.</NOTE>, perhaps the two children who bore that title; one of
them is in the king's closet at St. James's. He painted too a cieling
in the king's bedchamber at Whitehall.</P>
<P>Wright attended Roger Palmer earl of Castlemain, as steward of
his houshold, on his embassy to the Pope, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It is well known with what neglect and indifference this Embassy was re∣ceived by the Pope. The Jesuits endeavoured to compensate for the Pontiff's contempt: they treated Castlemaine in a most magnificent manner, and all the arts were called in to demonstrate their zeal, and compliment the bigot-monarch. But the good fathers were unlucky in some of their inscriptions, which furnished ample matter for ridicule; particularly speaking of James, they said, <HI>Alas Carolo addidit</HI>; and that the former might chuse an Embassador worthy of sending to heaven, <HI>He dispatched his brother.</HI> V. Hist. of England in two volumes. Vol. ii. p. 113. 5th edition 1723.</NOTE> and at his return published
a pompous account of it, first in Italian, then in English. He had
been in Italy before. At his return from the embassy he was morti∣fied
to find that Sir Godfrey Kneller had engrossed most of his busi∣ness.
In 1700, upon a vacancy of the king's painter in Scotland,
he sollicited to succeed, but a shop-keeper was preferred—and in
truth Wright had not much pretensions to favour in that reign—yet
as good as his fellow-labourer Tate, who wrote panegyrics in Wright's
edition of the embassy, and yet was made Poet Laureat to king Wil∣liam.
<PB N="43" REF="54" MS="y"/>
Orlandi mentions Wright; "Michaele <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. T. Pelham of Stanmore has a small three-quarters of Mrs. Cleypole, on which is written M. Ritus. Fec. It is an emblematic piece, the allegory of which is very obscure, but highly finished. There is another exactly the same, except that it wants the painter's name, at East Horsley, formerly the seat of Sir Edward Nicholas.</NOTE> Rita Inglese notato
nel Catalogo degli Academici di Roma nel anno 1688." Wright
left a son at Rome, who was master of languages and died there.
He had a nephew too of his own name, educated at Rome, but who
settled in Ireland, where he had so much success, that he gained 900<HI>l.</HI>
the first year, and was always paid 10<HI>l.</HI> a head. Pooley and Magda∣len
Smith were there at the same time; the latter and young Wright
were rivals.</P>
<P>Wright the uncle had a fine collection of gems and coins, which
were purchased by Sir Hans Sloane after his death, which happened
about the year 1700, in James-street Covent-garden. He is buried
in that church.</P>
<P>EDMUND ASHFIELD <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Graham.</NOTE>,</P>
<P>Scholar of Wright, was well descended, and painted both in oil and
crayons, in which he made great improvements for multiplying the
tints. He instructed Lutterel, who added the invention of using
crayons on copper plates. Vertue had seen a head of Sir John Ben∣net,
afterwards lord Ossulston, painted neatly by Ashfield, tho' not in
a good manner: but at Burleigh is a small portrait of a lady Herbert
by him highly finished and well painted.

<P>Was born at Harlem in 1627, and learned of Francis Hals, whose
daughter he married, and whose manner for some time he followed;
but afterwards taking to still life, painted little else. Sir Peter Lely
was very kind <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Descamps says, that Lely growing jealous of Roestraten, proposed to him a partition of the art; portraits were to be monopolized by Lely; all other branches were to be ceded to Roestraten, whose works were to be vaunted by Lely, and for which by these means he received 40 and 50 guineas. It is very improbable that an artist should relinquish that branch of his business, which such a proposal told him he was most capable of executing.</NOTE> to him at his arrival in England, and introduced
him to king Charles, but it does not appear that he was encouraged
at court, nothing of his hand appearing in the palaces or royal cata∣logues;
he found more countenance from the nobility. There is a
good picture by him at Kiveton, the seat of the duke of Leeds, one
at Chatsworth, and two were at lord Pomfret's. At lord Radnor's
fale in 1724 were three or four of his pictures, particularly one repre∣senting
the crown, scepter and globe. He was particularly fond of
drawing wrought plate. At the countess of Guildford's at Walde∣share
in Kent are some of his works. I have one, well coloured, con∣taining
an ivory tankard, some figures in bronze, and a medal of
Charles II. appendent to a blue ribband. It is certain that he arrived
early in this reign, for he hurt his hip at the fire of London and went
lame for the rest of his life. Graham says, that having promised to
show a whole length by Francis Hals to a friend, and the latter grow∣ing
impatient, he called his wife, who was his master's daughter, and

said, "there is a whole length by Hals." These are trifling circum∣stances,
but what more important happens in sedentary and retired
lives? They are at least as well worth relating as the witticisms of the
old philosophers. Roestraten died in 1698, in the same street with
Michael Wright, and was buried in the same church.</P>
<P>GERARD SOEST, called ZOUST,</P>
<P>Was born in Westphalia, and came to England probably before the
restoration, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Printed in 1685. Describing a picture of a husband and wife, he says, "It must be valued an ornament to the dyning-room; being besides well known to be the art of Sowst's handy-work, and he a master of sufficiencie. Gra∣phice p 43. At Welbeck is Lucy lady Hollis by him, 1657.</NOTE> for Sanderson mentions him as then of established
reputation. By what I have seen of his hand, particularly his
own head at Houghton, he was an admirable master. It is animated
with truth and nature; round, bold, yet highly finished. His dra∣peries
were often of sattin, in which he imitated the manner of Ter∣burgh,
a Dutch painter of conversations, but enlarged his ideas, on
seeing Vandyck. He was inlisted among the rivals of Sir Peter Lely;
the number of them is sufficient honour to the latter. Emulation sel∣dom
unites a whole profession against one, unless he is clearly their
superior. Soest is commended by Vertue and Graham for his por∣traits
of men: Both confess that his taste was too Dutch and ungrace∣ful,
and his humour too rough to please the softer sex. The gentle
manners of Sir Peter carried them all from his competitor. Soest
who was capricious, slovenly and covetous, often went to the door
himself, and if he was not in a humour to draw those who came to sit,
<PB N="46" REF="59"/>
or was employed in the meaner offices of his family, he would act the
servant and say his master was not at home: his dress made him easily
mistaken. Once when he lived in Cursitor's-alley, he admitted two
ladies, but quitted the house himself.—His wife was obliged to say,
that since he could not please the ladies, he would draw no more of
them. Greenhill carried <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of this person I find no other account.</NOTE> Wildt the painter to Soest, who then lived
at the corner house in Holbourn-row, and he showed them a man and
horse large as life on which he was then at work, out of humour with
the public and the fairer half of it. In Jervase's sale was a portrait
of Mr. John Norris by Soest, which Jervase esteemed so much, that
he copied it more than once, and even imitated it in his first pictures.
On the back was written 1685, but that was a mistake; Soest died
in Feb. 1681. I have a head by him, I believe of Griffiere; it has a
mantle of purple sattin, admirably coloured. At the Royal Society is
a head of Dr. John Wallis; at Draper's-hall Sheldon Lord Mayor,
whole length; in the audit-room of Christ-church Oxford, a head of
Fuller bishop of Lincoln; and at Wimpole was a good double half∣length
of John earl of Bridgwater and Grace, his countess, sitting.
Vertue describes another head of Sir Francis Throckmorton, in a full
wig and a cravat tied with a ribband, and the painter's name; a fine
head of Loggan the engraver; and another which he commends ex∣tremely
of a gentleman in a full dark-perriwig, and pink-coloured
drapery: on the straining frame was writ

<P>JOHN LOTEN,</P>
<P>A Dutch landscape-painter, lived here long and painted much; chiefly
glades, dark oaken groves, land-storms and water-falls; and in Swis∣serland,
where he resided too, he drew many views of the Alps. He
died in London about 1680. In king James's catalogue, where are
mentioned three of his landscapes, he is called Loaton; except this
little notice, all the rest is taken from Graham, as are the three next
articles entirely.</P>

<P>An English landscape-painter, who had studied in Italy, from whence
he brought a collection of pictures that were sold in the Banquetting∣house.
He lived ten years after the preceding.

<P><PB N="48" REF="61" MS="y"/>NICHOLAS BYER,</P>
<P>Born at Dronthem in Norway, painted both history and portraits. He
was employed by Sir William Temple for three or four years, at his
house at Shene near Richmond where he died. All that Graham
knew remarkable relating to him, was that he was the first man bu∣ried
in St. Clement's Danes after it was re-built, which had been
founded by his country-men.</P>
<P>ADAM COLONI,</P>
<P>Of Roterdam, lived many years in England, and was famous for small
figures, country-wakes, cattle, fire-pieces, &amp;c. He copied many
pictures of Bassan, particularly those in the royal collection. He died
in London 1685, at the age of 51, and was buried in St. Martin's.</P>
<P>His son Henry Adrian Coloni, was instructed by his father and by
his brother-in-law Vandiest, and drew well. He sometimes painted
in the landscapes of the latter, and imitated Salvator Rosa. He was
buried near his father in 1701, at the age of 33.</P>
<P>JOHN GRIFFIERE,</P>
<P>An agreable painter, called the gentleman of Utrecht, was born at
Amsterdam in 1645, and placed apprentice to a carpenter, a profes∣sion
not at all suiting his inclination. He knew he did not like to be
a carpenter, but had not discovered his own bent. He quitted his
master, and was put to school, but becoming acquainted with a lad
<PB N="49" REF="62"/>
who was learning to paint earthen-ware, young Griffiere was struck
with the science tho' in so rude a form, and passed his time in assist∣ing
his friend instead of going to school, yet returning regularly at
night as if he had been there. This deception however could not
long impose on his father, who prudently yielded to the force of the
boy's genius, but while he gratified it, hoped to secure him a profes∣sion,
and bound him to the same master with his friend the tyle∣painter.
Griffiere improved so much even in that coarse school, that
he was placed with a painter of flowers, and then instructed by one
Roland Rogman, whose landscapes were esteemed. He received oc∣casional
lessons too from Adrian Vandevelde, Ruisdale, and Rem∣brant,
whose peculiarity of style, and facility of glory, acquired rather
by a bold trick of extravagant chiaro scuro than by genius, captiva∣ted
the young painter, and tempted him to pursue that manner. But
Rogman dissuaded him, and Griffiere tho' often indulging his taste,
seems to have been fixed by his master to landscapes, which he execu∣ted
with richness and neat colouring, and enlivened with small figures,
cattle and buildings.</P>
<P>When he quitted Rogman and Utrecht, he went to Roterdam, and
soon after the fire of London, came to England, married and settled
here; received some instructions from Loten, but easily excelled him.
He drew some views of London, Italian ruins and prospects on the
Rhine. Such mixed scenes of rivers and rich country were his favo∣rite
subjects. He bought a yatch, embarked with his family and
his pencils, and passed his whole time on the Thames, between Wind∣sor,
Greenwich, Gravesend, &amp;c. Besides these views, he excelled in
copying Italian and Flemish masters, particularly Polenburgh, Teni∣ers,
Hondecooter, Rembrandt and Ruysdale.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="63"/>
After staying here many years, he sailed in his own yatch to Roter∣dam,
but being tempted by a pilot who was coming to England,
suddenly embarked again for this country, but was shipwrecked, and
lost his whole cargo except a little gold which his daughter had wrap∣ped
in a leathern girdle. He remained in Holland ten or twelve years:
and returning to England, struck upon a sand-bank, where he was
eight days before he could get off. This new calamity cured him of
his passion for living on the water. He took a house in Millbank,
where he lived several years, and died in 1718, aged above 72. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His pictures were sold in Covent-garden after his death, with a collection by Italian and Flemish masters, brought from Holland by his son Robert. Among the father's paintings were some in imitation of the different manners of Elsheim∣er, Polenburg, Poussin, Wouverman, Berghem, Titian, Salvator Rosa, Gerard Dou, Bassan, Guido, and Vanderwerffe. In the same catalogue is mentioned a piece in water-colours by Polenburg.</NOTE> In
lord Orford's collection are two pretty pictures by him, a sea-port
and a landscape. He etched some small plates of birds and beasts
from drawings of Barlow, and five large half-sheet plates of birds in
a set of twelve; the other seven were done by Fr. Place.</P>
<P>Robert Griffiere, his son, born in England 1688, was bred under
his father, and made good progress in the art. He was in Ireland
when his father was ship-wrecked, and going to him in Holland, imi∣tated
his manner of painting and that of Sachtleven. John Griffiere,
a good copyist of Claud Lorrain, and who died in Pall-mall a few
years ago, was, I believe, the younger son of old Griffiere.</P>
<P>GERARD EDEMA,</P>
<P>Born according to Vertue in Friesland; Graham says at Amsterdam,
<PB N="51" REF="64" MS="y"/>
was scholar of Everding, whose manner he followed, and of whom
there is a small book of mountainous prospects, containing some 50
plates. Edema came to England about 1670, and made voyages
both to Norway and Newfoundland, to collect subjects for his pictures
among those wildnesses of nature; he delighting in rocky views,
falls of water, and scenes of horrour. For figures and buildings he
had no talent, and where he wanted them was assisted by Wyck. The
latter, Vandevelde and Edema lived some time at Mount-Edgcumbe
with Sir Richard, grandfather of the present lord Edgcumbe, and
painted several views of the mount in concert, which are now in a
manner decayed. Edema's temper was not so unsociable as his ge∣nius;
he loved the bottle, and died of it at Richmond about the year
1700; Graham says in the 40th year of his age, which probably is a
mistake, if he came to England in 1670—he could not have learnt
much of Everding, if he quitted his school at ten years old.</P>
<P>THOMAS STEVENSON,</P>
<P>Scholar of Aggas <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aggas, whom I have mentioned in the first volume, p. 169, was little more than a scene-painter, for which reason I do not give him a separate article here. All the account we have of him is from Graham.</NOTE>, who painted landscape in oil, figures and archi∣tecture
in distemper. The latter is only a dignified expression, used
by Graham, for scene painting, even in which kind, he owns, Steven∣son's
works grew despised. The designs for the pageant, called
Goldsmith's Jubilee, on the mayoralty of Sir Robert Vyner, were
given by this man.

</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="65"/>PHILIP DUVAL,</P>
<P>A French man, studied under Le Brun, and afterwards in Italy the
Venetian school. He came to England, and painted several pictures.
One for the famous Mrs. Stuart duchess of Richmond represented
Venus receiving armour from Vulcan for her son. The head-dress of
the goddess, her bracelets, and the Cupids had more the air of Ver∣sailles
than Latium. On the anvil was the painter's name, and the
date 1672. Notwithstanding the good breeding of his pencil, Duval
was unsuccessful, but Mr. Boyle finding in him some knowledge of
chymistry, in which he had hurt his small fortune, generously allowed
him an annuity of 50<HI>l.</HI> On the death of his patron Duval fell into
great indigence, and at last became disordered in his senses. He was
buried at St. Martin's about 1709.</P>
<P>EDWARD HAWKER,</P>
<P>Succeeded Sir Peter Lely in his house, not in his reputation. He
painted a whole length of the duke of Grafton, from which there is a
print and a head of Sir Dudley North; was a poor knight of Windsor,
and was living in 1721, aged fourscore. The reader must excuse
such brief or trifling articles. This work is but an essay towards the
history of our arts: All kind of notices are inserted to lead to farther
discoveries, and if a nobler compendium shall be formed, I willingly

<P>Sir JOHN GAWDIE,</P>

<P>BENEDETTO GENARO,</P>
<P>Nephew and disciple of Guercino, and if that is much merit, resem∣bling
him in his works. He imitated his uncle's extravagantly dark
shades, caught the roundness of his flesh, but with a disagreable livid∣ness,
and possessed at least as much grace and dignity. He came to
England, and was one of Charles's painters. In king James's cata∣logue
are mentioned twelve of his hand; most of them, I believe, are
still in the royal palaces, four are at Windsor. At Chatsworth are
three by him; and Lot and his daughters at Coudray. His Hercules
and Deianira was sold at Streater's sale for 11 <HI>l.</HI> He was born in 1633,
and died in 1715. It is said that he had a mistress of whom he was
jealous, and whom he would not suffer the king to see.</P>
<P>GASPAR NETSCHER <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">he was disciple of Terburg, who Descamps and the French author that I shall mention presently, say, was in England; and the former adds that he re∣ceived immense prices for his works, and that he twice drew king William III. However, his stay here was certainly short, and as I cannot point out any of his works, it is not worth while to give him a separate article. His life may be seen in the authors I quote. Teniers, who, according to the same writers, was here too, came only to buy pictures, and therefore belongs still less to this catalogue.</NOTE>,</P>

One would think that Charles had invited Netscher to his parties of pleasure, or to be a minister. The solitude of a painter's life is little disturbed by working for a court. If the researches of Vertue were not more to be depended on than this inaccurate writer, the portraits of lord Berkeley and his lady would turn the bal∣lance in his favour. Did Netscher send them for presents to the king? I don't mean in general to detract from the merits of this writer; he seems to have un∣derstood the profession, and is particularly valuable for having collected so many portraits of artists, and for giving lists of engravers after their pictures. His work consists of three volumes quarto.</NOTE> staid not long
here. Vertue mentions five of his pictures: one, a lady and a dog,
with his name to it: another of a lady, her hands joined, oval on
copper: the third, lord Berkeley of Stratton, his lady, and a servant,
in one piece, dated 1676. The others, small ovals on copper of king
William and queen Mary, painted just before the revolution, in the
collection of the duke of Portland. Netscher died of the gravel and
gout in 1684.

<P>PETER STOOP,</P>
<P>A Fleming, was settled with his family at Lisbon, from whence
they followed Catherine of Portugal to England. Peter painted bat∣tles,
huntings, processions, &amp;c. and his brothers Roderigo and Theo∣dore
engraved them. If the pictures were equal to the plates from
them, which are extremely in the manner of Della Bella, Peter was
an artist of great merit. Graham says so, but that his reputation de∣clined
on the arrival of Wyck. Stoop was employed by one Doily, a
dealer in pictures, stuffs, &amp;c. and gave some instructions in paint∣ing
to Johnson that admirable old comedian, the most natural and of
the least gesticulation I ever knew, so famous for playing the grave∣digger
in Hamlet, Morose, Noll Bluff, Bishop Gardiner, and a few
other parts, and from whom Vertue received this account. Stoop
lived in Durham-yard, and when an aged man retired to Flanders
about 1678, where he died eight years afterwards. Vertue does not
say directly that the other two were brothers of Stoop; on the con∣trary
he confounds Roderigo with Peter, but I conclude they were his
brothers or sons, from the prints etched by them about the very time
of Peter's arrival in England. They are a set of eight plates contain∣ing
the public entry of admiral Sandwich into Lisbon, and all the
circumstances of the queen's departure, arrival, and entries at White∣hall
and Hampton-court. I have never been able to meet but with
two of them; one, the entry of the earl, is dedicated to him by
<PB N="57" REF="70"/>
Theodore Stoop, ipsius regiae majestatis pictor, and is the only one to
which Vertue mentions the name of Theodore. The other in my
possession is the queen's arrival at Hampton-court; but the name is
wanting. Vertue describes besides a picture, seven feet wide and two
high, containing the king's cavalcade through the gates of the city the
day before his coronation, but printed in 1662. He says not where
he saw it, but calls the painter Roderigo Stoop, as he does the engra∣ver
of the rest of the above-mentioned plates. It is not impossible
but Peter might have assumed the Portuguese name of Roderigo at
Lisbon. Some of the plates, among Hollar's, to Ogleby's Aesop,
were done by the same person, but very poorly.</P>

"Mr. William Vandevelde, senior, late painter of sea-fights to
their majesties king Charles II. and king James dyed 1693."</P>
<P>William Vandevelde, the son, was the greatest man that has appear∣ed
in this branch of painting; the palm is not less disputed with Ra∣phael
for history, than with Vandevelde for sea-pieces: Annibal Ca∣racci
and Mr. Scott have not surpassed those chieftains. William was
born at Amsterdam in 1633, and wanted no master but his father, till
the latter came to England; then for a short time he was placed with
Simon de Vlieger, an admired ship-painter of that time, but whose
name is only preserved now by being united to his disciple's. Young
William was soon demanded by his father, and graciously entertained
by the king, to whose particular inclination his genius was adapted.
William, I suppose, lived chiefly with his father at Greenwich, who
had chosen that residence as suited to the subjects he wanted. In
king James's collection were eighteen pieces of the father and son;
several are at Hampton-court and at Hinchinbrook. At Buckingham-house
was a view of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vandevelde, by order of the Duke of York, attended the engagement in a small vessel.</NOTE> Solebay-fight by the former, with a long inscrip∣tion.
But the best chosen collection of these masters is in a chamber
at Mr. Skinner's in Clifford-street Burlington-gardens, assembled at
great prices by the late Mr. Walker. Vandevelde the son having
painted the junction of English and French fleets at the Nore, whither
king Charles went to view them, and where he was represented going
on board his own yatch, two commissioners of the Admiralty agreed
to beg it of the king, to cut it in two, and each to take a part. The
painter, in whose presence they concluded this wise treaty, took away
the picture and concealed it, till the king's death, when he offered it to

Bullfinch, the printseller (from whom Vertue had the story) for four∣score
pounds. Bullfinch took time to consider, and returning to the
purchase, found the picture sold for 130 guineas. Afterwards it was
in the possession of Mr. Stone, a merchant retired into Oxfordshire.</P>

what became of the painter: it is said that before his departure
from England, he had been invited to Poland by his old patron the
marquis de Bethune, and probably went thither on the death of the
embassador <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Francisco Milé, a landscape painter of Antwerp, was here towards the end of Charles's reign, but probably staid not long.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WILLIAM WISSING,</P>
<P>Was born at Amsterdam and bred under Dodaens an historic painter
of the Hague, from whence Wissing passed into France, contracted
<PB N="62" REF="77" MS="y"/>
the furbelowed style of that country and age, and came into England,
where at least he learned it in it's perfection from Sir Peter Lely for
whom he worked, and after whose death he grew into fashion. He
drew all the royal family, and particularly the duke of Monmouth se∣veral
times, which ingratiated him with the king and the ladies. Sir
Godfrey Kneller, then the rising genius, was a formidable rival, but
death put an end to the contest in the thirty-first year of Wissing's age,
who deceased at Burleigh, the lord Exeter's, in 1687. He was buried
at the expence of that earl in St. Martin's Stamford, where against a
pillar in the middle isle of the church, is a monumental table to his
memory; the inscription may be seen in Graham. There are several
prints from his works, particularly one of queen Catherine with a dog.
Prior <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prior early in his life was patronized by that noble family, and by his pleas∣ing verses has added celebrity to that venerable palace, sacred by the memory of Burleigh, and ornamented with a profusion of Carlo Maratti's and Luca Jor∣dano's works.</NOTE> wrote a poem on the last picture he painted. A mezzotinto
of Wissing is thus inscribed; Gulielmus Wissingus, inter pictores sui
saeculi celeberrimos, nulli secundus, artis suae non exiguum decus &amp; or∣namentum.
immodicis brevis est aetas.</P>
<P>ADRIAN HENNY or HENNIN,</P>
<P>One of the last painters who arrived in the reign of Charles II. little
is known of him, but that having been two years in France, he adop∣ted
the manner of Gaspar Poussin. Vertue thought he came in 1680;
if so, the title-plate to a history of Oxford designed by him, and en∣graved
by White in 1674, must have been done antecedent to his ar∣rival.
<PB N="63" REF="78"/>
He painted much at Eythorp, the seat of Dormer lord Carnar∣von,
now of Sir William Stanhope, and died here in 1710.</P>
<P>HERBERT TUER</P>
<P>Was second son of Theophilus Tuer, by Catherine, neice of Mr.
George Herbert the poet: his grandfather and great-grandfather
were vicars, the former of Elsenham in Essex, the latter of Sabridge∣worth
in Hertfordshire, towards the latter end of Elizabeth. Herbert,
who received his name from his maternal uncle, withdrew with his
youngest brother Theophilus, into Holland, after the death of Charles
1st. The latter followed arms; Herbert applied to painting, and
made good progress in portraits, as appears by some small ones of
himself and family, now in England, where however they are little
known. A print of Sir Lionel Jenkins, probably drawn at Nime∣guen,
is from a picture by Tuer. He married two wives, Mary Van
Gameren, daughter of a procurer of Utrecht, and Elizabeth Van Hey∣menbergh.
John, his son by the first, was resident at Nimeguen with
his mother-in-law in 1680, at which time Herbert was dead. It is
believed that he died at Utrecht, where in the Painter's-hall is said to
be a head finely coloured by him.</P>
<P>TEMPESTA and TOMASO,</P>
<P>Two painters who worked at Wilton, painting cielings and pannels
of rooms. Tempesta was I believe, son of a well-known painter of
the same name. Tomaso, and a brother of his, who was employed at
Wilton too, were brought over by Sir Charles Cotterel, for which rea∣son
<PB N="64" REF="79"/>
I have placed them here, tho' I do not know exactly whether their
performances were not dated a little later than this period. I find no
other mention of them <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Delawar has a picture of Apollo and the Muses, evidently a copy of Rubens; in one corner is the painter's name, J. Tomaso.</NOTE> or Tempesta in England. There are at Wil∣ton
two pieces of tapestry after the Cartoons of Raphael, with the
workman's name Stephen Mayn, and his arms, a cross of St. George;
probably executed long before this period, and perhaps not in England.</P>
<P>If our painters in oil were not of the first rate during the period I
have been describing, in water-colours that reign has the highest pre∣tensions.</P>
<P>SAMUEL COOPER,</P>
<P>Owed great part of his merit to the works of Vandyck, and yet may
be called an original genius, as he was the first who gave the strength
and freedom of oil to miniature. Oliver's works are touched and re∣touched
with such careful fidelity that you cannot help perceiving they
are nature in the abstract; Cooper's are so bold that they seem per∣fect
nature only of a less standard. Magnify the former, they are still
diminutively conceived: if a glass could expand Cooper's pictures to
the size of Vandyck's, they would appear to have been painted for that
proportion. If his portrait of <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This fine head is in the possession of the lady Frankland, widow of Sir Tho∣mas,
a descendent of Cromwell. The body is unfinished. Vertue engraved it,
as he did another, in profile, in the collection of the duke of Devonshire.</NOTE> Cromwell could be so enlarged, I don't
know but Vandyck would appear less great by the comparison. To
make it fairly, one must not measure the Fleming by his most admired

<PB N="65" REF="81"/>
piece, cardinal Bentivoglio: The quick finesse of eye in a florid Ita∣lian
writer was not a subject equal to the protector; but it would be
an amusing trial to balance Cooper's Oliver and Vandyck's lord Straf∣ford.
To trace the lineaments of equal ambition, equal intrepidity,
equal art, equal presumption, and to compare the skill of the masters
in representing the one exalted to the height of his hopes, yet perplex∣ed
with a command he could scarce hold, did not dare to relinquish,
and yet dared to exert; the other, dashed in his career, willing to
avoid the precipice, searching all the recesses of so great a soul, to
break his fall, and yet ready to mount the scaffold with more dignity
than the other ascended the throne. This parallel is not a picture
drawn by fancy; if the artists had worked in competition, they could
not have approached nigher to the points of view in which I have
traced the characters of their heroes.</P>
<P>Cooper with so much merit had two defects. His skill was confi∣ned
to a meer head; his drawing even of the neck and shoulders so
incorrect and untoward, that it seems to account for the numbers of
his works unfinished. It looks as if he was sensible how small a way
his talent extended. This very poverty accounts for the other, his
want of grace: A signal deficience in a painter of portraits—yet how
seldom possessed! Bounded as their province is to a few tame atti∣tudes,
how grace attones for want of action! Cooper, content, like
his countrymen, with the good sense of truth, neglected to make
truth engaging. Grace in painting seems peculiar to Italy. The
Flemings and the French run into opposite extremes. The first
never approach the line, the latter exceed it, and catch at most but a
lesser species of it, the genteel, which if I were to define, I should call
familiar grace, as grace seems an amiable degree of majesty. Cooper's
<PB N="66" REF="82"/>
women, like his model Vandyck's, are seldom very handsome. It is
Lely alone that excuses the galantries of Charles II. He painted an
apology for that Asiatic court.</P>
<P>The anecdotes of Cooper's life are few; nor does it signify; his
works are his history. He was born in 1609 and instructed, with his
brother Alexander, by their uncle Hoskins, who, says Graham, was
jealous of him, and whom he soon surpassed. The variety of tints that
he introduced, the clearness of his carnations, and loose management
of hair exceed his uncle, though in the last Hoskins had great merit
too. The author I have just quoted mentions another capital work of
Cooper, the portrait of one Swingfield, which recommended the artist
to the court of France, where he painted several pieces larger than his
usual size, and for which his widow received a pension during her life.
He lived long in France, and Holland, and dying in London May 5, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Willett in Thames-street has a head of a young man in armour, of the family of Deane in Suffolk, not equal to most of Cooper's works. My reason for mentioning it, is, it's being set in an enamelled case, on the out∣sides of which are two beautifull Madonnas, each with the child, freely painted, in a light style: within, is likewise an enamelled landscape. The picture is dated 1649. This, collated with my enamel of general Fairfax, seems to corro∣borate my opinion that Bordier (by whom I take these enamels to be painted) remained here after Petitot left England.</NOTE>
1672 at the age of 63 was buried in Pancras-church, where is a monu∣ment
for him. The inscription is in Graham, who adds that he had
great skill in music, and played well on the lute.</P>
<P>His works are too many to be enumerated, seven or eight are in
queen Caroline's closet at Kensington; one of them, a head of
Moncke, is capital; but unfinished. Lord Oxford had a head of

archbishop Sheldon; and the bust of lord chancellor Shaftsbury on
his monument by Rysbrach was taken from a picture of Cooper.</P>
<P>It is an anecdote little known, I believe, and too trifling but for
such a work as this, that Pope's mother was sister of Cooper's wife.
Lord Carleton had a portrait of Cooper in crayons, which Mrs. Pope
said was not very like, and which, descending to lord Burlington, was
given by his lordship to Kent. It was painted by one Jackson, a re∣lation
of Cooper, of whom I know nothing more, and who, I sup∣pose,
drew another head of Cooper, in crayons, in queen Caroline's
closet, said to be painted by himself; but I find no account of his es∣says
in that way. He did once attempt oil, as Murray the painter
told Vertue, and added, that Hayles thereupon applied to miniature,
which he threatened to continue, unless Cooper desisted from oil;
which he did—but such menaces do not frighten much, unless se∣conded
by want of success. Among Orinda's poems is one to Cooper
on drawing her friend Lucasia's picture, in 1660.</P>
<P>RICHARD GIBSON,</P>
<P>The Dwarf, being page to a lady at Mortlack, was placed by her
with Francesco Cleyne, to learn to draw, in which he succeeded, per∣fecting
himself by copying the works of Sir Peter Lely, who drew
Gibson's picture leaning on a bust, 1658, another evidence of Sir
Peter being here before the restoration. It was in the possession of
Mr. Rose <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He married Gibson's daughter, a paintress, that will be mentioned hereafter.</NOTE> the jeweller, who had another head of the dwarf by Dob∣son,
and his little wife in black, by Lely. This diminutive couple
were married in the presence of Charles I. and his queen, who be∣spoke
<PB N="68" REF="85"/>
a diamond ring for the bride, but the troubles coming on she
never received it. Her <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See notes to Fenton's Waller.</NOTE> name was Anne Shepherd. The little
pair were each three feet ten inches high. Waller has celebrated
their nuptials in one of his prettiest poems. The husband was page
to the king, and had already attained such excellence, that a picture
of the man and lost sheep painted by him, and much admired by the
king, was the cause of Vanderdort's death, as we have seen in the pre∣ceeding
volume. Thomas <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gibson had been patronized by Philip earl of Pembroke, and painted Crom∣well's picture several times. Mrs. Gibson is represented by Vandyck in the picture with the duchess of Richmond at Wilton.</NOTE> earl of Pembroke had the portraits of the
dwarfs hand in hand by Sir Peter Lely, and exchanging it for another
picture, it fell into the possession of Cock the auctioneer, who sold it
to Mr. Gibson the painter in 1712. It was painted in the style of
Vandyck. Mr. <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mr. W. Hamilton, Envoy to Naples, has a drawing of Gibson by Vandyck.</NOTE> Rose had another small piece of the dwarf and his
master Francesco Cleyne, in green habits as archers, with bows and
arrows, and he had preserved Gibson's bow, who was fond of archery.
Gibson taught queen Anne to draw, and went to Holland to instruct
her sister the princess of Orange. The small couple had nine chil∣dren,
five of which lived to maturity, and were of a proper size.
Richard the father died in the 75th year of his age, and was buried <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">From the register, Richard Gibson died July 23, 1690.</NOTE>
at Covent-garden: his little widow lived till 1709, when she was 89
years old.</P>
<P>WILLIAM GIBSON,</P>
<P>Nephew of the preceding, was taught by him and Sir Peter Lely, and
<PB N="69" REF="86" MS="y"/>
copied the latter happily; but chiefly practiced miniature. He
bought great part of Sir Peter's collection, and added much to it.
Dying of a lethargy in 1702 at the age of 58, he was buried at Rich∣mond,
as was</P>
<P>EDWARD GIBSON,</P>
<P>I suppose, son of the dwarf. This young man began with painting
portraits in oil, but changed that manner for crayons. His own pic∣ture
done by himself in this way 1690, was at Tart-hall. Edward
died at the age of 33.</P>
<P>JOHN DIXON</P>
<P>Scholar of Sir Peter Lely, painted both in miniature and crayons, but
mostly the former. In the latter was his own head. In water-colours
there are great numbers of his works; above sixty were in lord
Oxford's collection, both portraits and histories, particularly, Diana
and her Nymphs bathing, after Polenburg, and a sleeping Venus,
Cupids, and a Satyr. These were his best works. He was keeper
of the king's picture-closet; and in 1698 was concerned in a bubble
Lottery. The whole sum was to be 40,000<HI>l.</HI> divided into 1214
prizes, the highest prize in money 3000<HI>l.</HI> the lowest 20<HI>l.</HI> One prize,
a collection of limnings, he valued so highly, that the person
to whom it should fall, might, in lieu of it, receive 2000<HI>l.</HI> each
ticket twenty shillings. Queen Anne, then princess, was an adven∣turer.
This affair turned out ill, and Dixon, falling into debt, re∣moved
for security from St. Martin's-lane, where he lived, to the
<PB N="70" REF="87" MS="y"/>
King's-bench-walks in the Temple, and latterly to a small estate he
had at Thwaite near Bungay in Suffolk, where he died about 1715;
and where his widow and children were living in 1725. Dixon, adds
Vertue, once bought a picture for a trifle at a broker's, which he sold
to the duke of Devonshire for 500<HI>l.</HI> but does not specify the hand
or subject.</P>
<P>ALEXANDER MARSHAL</P>
<P>Another performer in water-colonrs, who painted on velom a book of
Mr. Tradescant's <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">V. Museum Tradescantianum. It is a small book containing a catalogue of the rarities in that collection at Lambeth, with two prints by Hollar of the fa∣ther and son.</NOTE> choicest flowers and plants. At Dr. Friend's Vertue
saw several pretty large pieces after Vandyck, the flesh painted very
carefully. He mentions too one Joshua Marshall, a sculptor, who in
1664, executed the monument of Baptist lord Noel and his lady in
Gloucestershire.</P>
<P>WILLIAM HASSEL</P>
<P>Another painter known only to the industry of Mr. Vertue, who saw
an oval miniature of a Scotch gentleman, which being engraved by
P. Vanderbank was falsely inscribed <HI>lord Marr.</HI> The mark on the
picture was W. H. 1685. This, says Vertue, I think, was William
Hassel. Since the first edition I am informed that Mr. Hassel not
only painted in miniature but in oil, in which way he executed an oval
head of Mr. Hughes, author of the seige of Damascus, who joined
the sister arts, and painted several small pieces in water-colours for his

amusement. That seraphic dame, Mrs. Rowe, also painted. A gen∣tleman
from whom I received these notices has a bust of the above∣mentioned
Mr. Hughes done by her in Indian ink. There lived a∣bout
the same time one Constantine, a landscape-painter, and Mr.
White, a limner: Mr. Hughes addressed a poem to the former.</P>
<P>MATTHEW SNELLING</P>
<P>A gentleman who painted in miniature, and that (being very galant)
seldom but for ladies. In Mr. Rose's sale 1723 was a head of Snel∣ling
by Cooper 1644, finely painted, but the hands and drapery poor.
Mr. Beal mentious him in one of his pocket-books <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the next article.</NOTE>, for sending pre∣sents
of colours to his wife in 1654, and 1658; and that in 1678,
Mr. Snelling offered him thirty guineas for a Venus and Cupid after
Rottenhamer, for which he asked forty guineas and was worth fifty. I
do not know whether this person was related to Thomas Snelling, a
poet recorded in Wood's Athenae, vol. ii. p. 135.</P>
<P>MARY BEALE</P>
<P>Was daughter of Mr. Cradock, minister of Walton <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Where Mr. Beale afterwards erected a monument for him.</NOTE> upon Thames,
and learned the rudiments of painting from Sir Peter Lely, and had
some instructions, as Vertue thought, from Walker. She painted in
oil, water-colours and crayons, and had much business; her portraits
were in the Italian style which she acquired by copying several pic∣tures
and drawings from Sir Peter Lely's and the royal collections.
<PB N="72" REF="90"/>
Her master was supposed to have had a tender attachment to her,
but as he was reserved in communicating to her all the resources of
his pencil, it probably was a galant passion, rather than a successful
one. Dr. Woodfall wrote several poems to her honour, under the
name of Belesia; but the fullest history of her life and works was re∣corded
by her own husband, who in small almanac-pocket-books
minuted down almost daily accounts of whatever related to himself,
his business, and his wife's pictures. Of these almanacs there were
above thirty, which with most of Mr. Beale's papers came into the
hands of Carter, colourman, to whom Beale bequeathed them. Some
were sold to Mr. Brooke a clergyman. His share Carter lent to a
low painter, whose goods being seized the pocket-books were lost, but
seven of them a friend of Vertue's met with on a stall, bought, and
lent to him. Most of his extracts I shall now offer to the reader,
without apprehension of their being condemned as trifling or tiresome.
If they are so, how will this whole work escape? When one writes
the lives of artists, who in general were not very eminent, their
pocket-books are as important as any part of their history—I shall
use no farther apology—if even those that are lost should be
regretted!</P>
<P>"The first is 1672. 20 April. Mr. Lely was here with Mr. Gib∣son
and Mr. Skipwith, to see us, and commended very much her
(Mrs. Beale's) coppy after our Saviour praying in the garden, &amp;c.
after Anto. da Correggio: her coppy in little after Endimion Porter
his lady and three sons he commended extraordinarily, and said (to
use his own words) it was painted like Vandyke himself in little, and
that it was the best coppy he ever saw of Vandyke. Also he very
well liked her two coppyes in great of Mr. Porter's little son Phil. He
<PB N="73" REF="91"/>
commended her other works, coppyes and those from the life. Both
he and Mr. Gibson both commended her works.</P>
<P>"Mr. Lely told me at the same time as he was most studiously
looking at my bishop's picture of Vandyke's, and I chanced to ask him
how Sir Antony cou'd possibly divise to finish in one day a face that
was so exceeding full of work, and wrought up to so extraordinary a
perfection—I believe, said he, he painted it over fourteen times.
And upon that he took occasion to speake of Mr. Nicholas Laniere's
picture of Sr. Anto. V. D. doing, which, said he, Mr. Laniere him∣self
told me he satt seaven entire dayes for it to Sr. Anto. and that he
painted upon it of all those seaven dayes both morning and afternoon,
and only intermitted the time they were at dinner. And he said like∣wise
that tho' Mr. Laniere satt so often and so long for his picture,
that he was not permitted so much as once to see it, till he had per∣fectly
finished the face to his own satisfaction. This was the picture
which being show'd to king Charles the first caused him to give order
that V. Dyck shou'd be sent for over into England.</P>

<P>CAIUS GABRIEL CIBBER, or CIBERT,</P>
<P>Son of a cabinet-maker to the king of Denmark, was born at Flens∣burg
in the duchy of Holstein, and discovering a talent for sculpture
was sent at the king's expence to Rome. More of his early history is
not known. He came to England not long before the Restoration,
and worked for John Stone, son of Nicholas, who going to Holland,
and being seized with a palsey, Cibber his foreman was sent to con∣duct
him home. We are as much in the dark as to the rest of his life;
that singularly-pleasing biographer his son, who has dignified so many
trifling Anecdotes of players by the expressive energy of his style, has
recorded nothing of a father's life who had such merit in his profession.
I can only find that he was twice married, and that by his second

wife descended from the ancient family of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By this alliance his children were kinsmen to William of Wickham, and on that foundation, one of them (afterwards a fellow of New-college Oxford and remarkable for his wit) was admitted of Winchester-college; in consideration of which the father carved and gave to that society, a statue of their founder.</NOTE> Colley in Rutlandshire, he
had 6000<HI>l.</HI> and several children, among whom was the well-known
laureat, born in 1671 at his father's house in Southampton-street
facing Southampton-house. Gabriel Cibber the statuary was carver
to the king's closet and died about 1700 at the age of 70. His son
had a portrait of him by old Laroon, with a medal in his hand. I
have one in water-colours with a pair of compasses, by Christian
Richter; probably a copy from the former, with a slight variation.
What is wanting in circumstances, is more than compensated by his
works. The most capital are the two figures of melancholy and
raving madness before the front of Bedlam. The basreliefs <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">A description of them may be seen in the new account of London and the environs. Vol. v. p. 3.</NOTE> on two
sides of the monument are by his hand too. So are the fountain in
Soho-square and one of the fine vases at Hampton-court, said to be
done in competition with a foreigner who executed the other, but no∣body
has told us which is Cibber's. He carved most of the statues of
kings round the Royal-exchange, as far as king Charles, and that of
Sir Thomas Gresham in the piazza beneath. The first duke of Devon∣shire
employed him much at Chatsworth; where two sphinxes on large
bases, well executed and with ornaments in good taste are of his work,
and till very lately there was a statue of Neptune in a fountain, still
better. He carved there several door-cases of alabaster with rich fo∣liage,
and many ornaments in the chapel; and on each side of the
altar is a statue by him, Faith and Hope; the draperies have great
<PB N="86" REF="105" MS="y"/>
merit, but the airs of the heads are not so good as that of the Neptune.
Cibber built the Danish church in London and was buried there him∣self,
with his second wife, for whom a monument was erected in 1696.
The son will be known as long as the Careless Husband and the Me∣moires
of his own Life exist, and so long the injustice of calling the
figures at Bedlam<Q>—his brazen brainless brothers,</Q>and the peevish weakness of thrusting him into the Dunciad in the
room of Theobald, the proper hero, will be notorious.</P>
<P>FRANCIS DU SART</P>
<P>Of Hanau, is mentioned in De Bie's Golden Cabinet, who says, he
was employed by the king of England to adorn his palace with works
in marble and models in clay, and that he died in London 1661. It
is uncertain whether this <HI>king</HI> was Charles the first, or whether Du
Sart came over and died soon after the Revolution.</P>

<P>An original genius, a citizen of nature; consequently, it is indifferent
where she produced him. When a man strikes out novelty from
himself, the place of his birth has little claim on his merit. Some
become great poets or great painters because their talents have capital
models before their eyes. An inventor is equally a master, whether
born in Italy or Lapland. There is no instance of a man before
Gibbons who gave to wood the loose and airy lightness of flowers, and

chained together the various productions of the elements with a free
disorder natural to each species: Vertue had received two different
accounts of his birth; from Murray the painter, that he was born in
Holland of English parents, and came over at the age of nineteen;
from Stoakes (relation of the Stones) that his father was a Dutchman,
but that Gibbons himself was born in Spur-alley in the Strand.
This is circumstantial, and yet the former testimony seems most true,
as Gibbons is an English name, and Grinling probably Dutch. He
afterwards lived, added Stoakes, in Belsavage-court on Ludgate-hill,
where he carved a pot of flowers which shook surprizingly with the
motion of the coaches that passed by. It is certain that he was em∣ployed
by Betterton on the decorations of the Theatre in Dorset∣garden,
where he carved the capitals, cornices and eagles. He lived
afterwards at Deptford, in the same house with a musician, where the
beneficent and curious Mr. Evelyn found and patronized them both.
This gentleman, Sir Peter Lely, and Bap. May, who was something
of an architect himself, recommended Gibbons to Charles II. who
though too indolent to search for genius, and too indiscriminate in his
bounty to confine it to merit, was always pleased, when it was
brought home to him. He gave the artist a place in the board of
works, and employed his hand on the ornaments of most taste in his
palaces, particularly at Windsor, where in the chapel the simplicity of
the carver's foliage at once sets off and atones for the glare of Verrio's
paintings. Gibbons in gratitude made a present of his own bust in
wood to Mr. Evelyn who kept it at his house in Dover-street. The
piece that had struck so good a judge was a large carving in wood of
St. Stephen stoned, long preserved in the sculptor's own house, and
afterwards purchased and placed by the duke of Chandos at Cannons.
<PB N="88" REF="108" MS="y"/>
At Windsor too, Gibbons, whose art penetrated all materials, carved
that beautiful pedestal in marble for the equestrian <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Under the statue is an engine for raising water contrived by Sir Samuel Morland alias Morley; he was son of Sir Samuel Morland of Sulhamsted Bani∣ster in the county of Berkshire, created a baronet by Charles II. in consideration of services performed during the king's exile.

He invented the drum-capstands for weighing heavy anchors; and the speaking trumpet, and other useful engines. He died and was buried at Hammersmith in Middlesex 1696. There is a monument for the two wives of Sir Samuel Morland in Westminster-abbey. His arms were sable a leopard's head jessant a fleur de lys, or. There is a print of the son by Lombart after Lely.

in all kinds, did not reach to human figures, unless the brazen
<PB N="89" REF="109"/>
statue of James II. in the Privy-garden be, as I have reason to believe
it, of his hand. There is great ease in the attitude, and a classic sim∣plicity.
Vertue met with an agreement, signed by Gibbons himself,
for a statue of James II. the price 300<HI>l.</HI> half to be paid down on sign∣ing
the agreement; 50<HI>l.</HI> more at the end of three months, and the

I am the rather inclined to attribute the statue at Whitehall to Gibbons, because I know no other artist of that time capable of it.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Gibbons made a magnificent tomb for Baptist Noel Viscount
Camden, in the church of Exton in Rutlandshire; it cost 1000<HI>l.</HI> is
22 feet high, and 14 wide. There are two figures of him, and his
lady, and basreliefs of their children. The same workman performed
the wooden throne at Canterbury, which cost 70 <HI>l.</HI> and was the dona∣tion
of archbishop Tenison. The foliage in the Choir of St. Paul's is
of his hand. At Burleigh is a noble profusion of his carving, in pic∣ture-frames,
chimney-pieces, and door-cases, and the last Supper in
alto relievo, finely executed. At Chatsworth, where a like taste col∣lected
ornaments by the most eminent living masters, are many by Gib∣bons,
particularly in the chapel; in the great anti-chamber are several
dead fowl over the chimney, finely executed, and over a closet door,
a pen not distinguishable from real feather. When Gibbons had
<PB N="90" REF="110"/>
finished his works in that palace, he presented the duke with a point
cravat, a woodcock, and a medal with his own head, all preserved in
a glass-case in the gallery. I have another point cravat by him, the
art of which arrives even to deception, and Herodias with St. John's
head, alto relievo in ivory. In Thoresby's collection was Elijah under
the juniper-tree supported by an Angel, six inches long and four wide. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ducatus Leodiensis, p. 488.</NOTE>
At Houghton two chimneys are adorned with his foliage. At Mr.
Norton's at Southwick in Hampshire was a whole gallery embroider∣ed
in pannels by his hand—but the most superb monument of his
skill is a large chamber at Petworth enriched from the cieling, between
the pictures, with festoons of flowers and dead game, &amp;c. all in the
highest perfection and preservation. Appendant to one is an antique
vase with a basrelief, of the purest taste, and worthy the Grecian age
of Cameos. Selden, one of his disciples and assistants—for what one
hand could execute such plenty of laborious productions? lost his life
in saving this carving when the seat was on fire. The font in St.
James's-church was the work of Gibbons.</P>
<P>If these encomiums <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Tate wrote a poem on the sight of a bust in marble of Gibbons.</NOTE> are exaggerated, the works are extant to con∣tradict
me. Let us now see how well qualified a man, who vaunts
his having been in England, was, to speak of Gibbons. It is the
author of the Abregè whom I have frequently mentioned. "Les
Anglois, <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. p. 216.</NOTE> says he, n'ont eu qu'un bon sculpteur, nommè Gibbons,
mais il n'etoit pas excellent. La figure de marbre de Charles II. pla∣cêe
au milieu de la bourse à Londres est de sa main." What would
this author have said of him, if he had wasted his art on ribbands
<PB N="91" REF="111" MS="y"/>
sand ringlets flowing in one blended stream from the laurel of Louis
XIV. to the tip of his horse's tail <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is litterally the case in the equestrian statue at Lyons.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>Gibbons died Aug. 3d, 1721, at his house in Bow-street, Covent∣garden,
and in November of the following year, his collection, a very
considerable one, of pictures, models, &amp;c. was sold by auction.
Among other things, were two chimney-pieces of his own work, the
one valued at 100<HI>l.</HI> the other at 120; his own bust in marble, by him∣self,
but the wig and cravat extravagant; and an original of Simon
the engraver by Sir Peter Lely, which had been much damaged by
the fall of Gibbons's house.</P>
<P>There are two different prints of Gibbons by Smith, both fine;
the one with his wife, after Closterman; the other from a picture at
Houghton by Sir Godfrey Kneller, who has shown himself as great
in that portrait as the man was who sat to him.</P>
<P>Gibbons had several disciples and workmen; Selden I have men∣tioned;
Watson assisted chiefly at Chatsworth, where the boys and
many of the ornaments in the chapel were executed by him. Dievot
of Brussels, and Laurens of Mechlin were principal journeymen—
Vertue says they modelled and cast the statue I have mentioned in the
Privy-garden, which confirms my conjecture of it's being the figure
intended in the agreement. If either of them <HI>modelled</HI> it, and not
Gibbons himself, the true artist deserves to be known. They both
retired to their own country on the Revolution; Laurens performed
much both in statuary and in wood, and grew rich. Dievot lived till
1715 and died at Mechlin.

the duke of Lauderdale. Dr. Rawlinson had the original warrant for
them signed by the king; one was to have been in steel, the other in
silver. At top was the draught and magnitude, neatly drawn, and a
memorandum that they were finished and delivered in Oct. 1678.</P>
<P>CHRISTIAN RESIN</P>
<P>The celebrated seal-cutter, best known by his baptismal name, was
born at Drontheim in Norway and bred a silver-smith. He was driven
by a storm on the coast of Scotland, tho' intending for England. He
worked two years at Aberdeen for one Melvin a silver-smith, and ar∣rived
in London the third day of the Conflagration 1666. He had
never attempted to engrave stones till settled in England. He was
confined in the Tower for four years on suspicion of engraving dies
for coining, but was released without a trial. These imperfect notes
are all I find relative to this Artist, whom Mr. Vertue calls Resin
Senior, whence and from it's more modern air I conclude the Mezzo∣tinto
exhibits his son, who probably followed his father's profession.</P>

by Webb, and etched by Hollar. Vertue says that Mr. Mills, one of
the four surveyors appointed after the fire of London, built the large
houses in Queen-street Lincoln's-inn-fields—but this must be a mis∣take,
as we have seen in the preceding volume, that Gerbier, a cotem∣porary

Wren even as an architect. Every circumstance of his story has been
written and repeated. Bishop Sprat, Antony Wood, Ward in his
lives of the Gresham Professors, the General Dictionary, and the New
Description of London and the Environs, both in the hands of every
body, are voluminous on the article of Sir Christopher: above all a
descendent of his own has given us a folio, called Parentalia, which
leaves nothing to be desired on this subject. Yet in a work of such a
nature as this, men would be disappointed, should they turn to it, and
receive no satisfaction. They must be gratified, though my province
becomes little more than that of a meer transcriber.</P>
<P>Sir Christopher Wren, of an ancient family in the Bishoprick of
Durham, was son of a dean of Windsor, and nephew of Matthew,
bishop, successively, of Hereford, Norwich, Ely. He was born at
London in 1632, and educated at Oxford. His mathematical abili∣ties
unfolded themselves so early, that by twenty he was elected pro∣fessor
of astronomy at Gresham-college, and eight years afterwards
Savilian professor of astronomy at Oxford. His discoveries in philo∣sophy,
mechanics, &amp;c. contributed to the reputation of the new
established Royal-society, and his skill in architecture had raised his
own name so high, that in the first year of the Restoration he was ap∣pointed
coadjutor to Sir John Denham surveyor of the works, whom
he succeeded in 1668. Three years before that he had visited France—
and unfortunately went no farther—the great number of drawings
<PB N="96" REF="117"/>
he made there from their buildings, had but too visible influence on
some of his own—but it was so far lucky for Sir Christopher, that
Louis XIV. had erected palaces only, no churches. St. Paul's escaped,
but <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have been assured by a descendent of Sir Christopher, that he gave another design for Hampton-court in a better taste, which queen Mary wished to have had executed, but was over-ruled.</NOTE> Hampton-court was sacrificed to the god of false taste. In 1680
he was chosen president of the Royal-society; was in two parliaments,
was twice married, had two sons and a daughter, and died <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Elkanah Settle published a funeral poem on him, called Threnodia Apolli∣naris; there is another in Latin in the Parentalia.</NOTE> in 1723,
at the age of ninety-one, having lived to see the completion of St.
Paul's; a fabric, and an event, which one cannot wonder left such an
impression of content on the mind of the good old man, that being
carried to see it once a year, it seemed to recall a memory that was
almost deadened to every other use. He was buried under his own
fabric, with four words that comprehend his merit and his fame; si
quaeras monumentum, circumspice!</P>
<P>Besides from his works <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">He wrote a poem, published in a collection at Oxford, on the revival of Anne Green.</NOTE> in architecture, which I am going to men∣tion,
Wren is intitled to a place in this catalogue by his talent for de∣sign.
He drew a view of Windsor, which was engraved by Hollar;
and eight or ten plates for Dr. Willis's anatomy of the brain 1664.
Vertue thinks they were engraved by Loggan. He found out a
speedy was of etching, and was the inventor of drawing pictures by
miscroscopic glasses; and he says himself, that he invented serpentine-rivers.

have quoted. His principal buildings were,</P>
<P>The Library of Trinity-college Cambridge, and a piece of architec∣ture

<P>The Chapel of Pembroke-hall.</P>
<P>The Theatre at Oxford. <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">He was consulted, and advised some alterations in a plan of the Chapel at Trinity-college Oxford.

not disgrace the modern. His want of taste in that ancient style
is the best excuse for another fault, the union of Grecian and Gothic.
The Ionic Colonade that crosses the inner quadrangle of Hampton-court
is a glaring blemish by it's want of harmony with the rest of
Wolsey's fabric. Kent was on the point of repeating this incongruity
in the same place in the late reign, but was over-ruled by my father.</P>

never saw a beautiful modern steeple. They are of Gothic origine,
and have frequently great merit either in the solid dignity of towers,
or in the airy form of taper spires. When broken into unmeaning
parts, as those erected in later times are, they are a pile of barbarous
ugliness, and deform the temples to which they are coupled. Sir
Christopher has shown how sensible he was of this absurdity imposed
on him by custom, by avoiding it in his next beautiful work,</P>
<P>St. Stephen Walbroke—but in vain—the Lord-mayor's Man∣sion-house

II. chose the spot for health, and pressed <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">V. Life of Sir Dudley North.</NOTE> Sir Christopher to have it
<PB N="99" REF="120"/>
finished in a year. The impropriety of the situation and the haste of
the execution are some excuse for the architect—but Sir Christopher
was not happy in all kind of buildings. He had great abilities rather
than taste. When he has shewed the latter, it was indeed to advan∣tage.
The circular porticos and other parts of St. Paul's are truly
gracefull; and so many great architects as were employed on St.
Peter's have not left it upon the whole a more perfect edifice than
this work of a single mind. The gawdiness of the Romish religion
has given St. Peter's one of it's chief advantages. The excess of
plainness in our cathedral disappoints the spectator after so rich an ap∣proach.
The late prince of Wales, I have heard, intended to intro∣duce
tombs into it, and to begin with that of his grandfather. Con∣sidering
that Westminster-abbey is overstocked, and that the most
venerable monuments of antiquity are daily removed there to make
room for modern (a precedent that one should think would discourage
even the moderns from dealing with the chapter) St. Paul's would
afford a new theatre for statuaries to exert their genius—and the
Abbey would still preserve it's general customers, by new recruits of
waxen puppets. The towers of the last mentioned fabric, and the
proposed spire were designed by Sir Christopher.</P>
<P>The Monument. The architect's intention was to erect the statue
of Charles II. on the summit, instead of that silly pot of flames; but
was over-ruled, as he often was by very inferior judgments.</P>
<P>The Theatre in Drury-lane; and the old Theatre in Salisbury-court.
The rest of his churches, publications, designs, &amp;c. may be
seen at large in the Parentalia. Among the latter was the mauso∣leum
of Charles I. It was curious piety in Charles II. to erect a mo∣nument
for the imaginary bones of Edward V. and his brother, and
<PB N="100" REF="121"/>
to sink 70,000<HI>l.</HI> actually given by parliament for a tomb for his
father!</P>
<P>Many drawings by Sir Christopher, particularly for St. Paul's,
were sold in his son's auction a few years ago.</P>
<P>The medallists in this reign lie in a narrow compass, but were not
the worst Artists.</P>
<P>The ROTIERS</P>
<P></P>
<P>Were a family of medallists. The father, a goldsmith and banker,
assisted Charles II. with money during his exile, in return for which
the king promised, if he was restored, to employ his sons, who were
all gravers of seals and coins. The Restoration happened; and
Charles, discontent with the inimitable Simon, who had served Crom∣well
and the Republic, sent for Rotier's sons. The two eldest, John
and Joseph, arrived (not entirely with their father's consent who
wished to have them settle in France, of which I suppose he was a
native) They were immediately placed in the mint, and allowed a
salary and a house, where they soon grew rich, being allowed 200 <HI>l.</HI>
for each broad seal, and gaining 300<HI>l.</HI> a year by vending great num∣bers
of medals abroad. On their success, Philip the third brother
came over, and worked for the government too. He is the only one
of the three, though John was reckoned the best artist, who has left
his name <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Unless a medal which I have mentioned in the second volume of this work, p. 41. was executed by Norbert.</NOTE> or initials on any of our medals; and he it was I believe,
who being in love with the fair Mrs. Stuart, duchess of Richmond,
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">V. Evelyn, p. 27, and 137.</NOTE> represented her likeness, under the form of Britannia, on the re∣verse
<PB N="101" REF="122"/>
of a large medal with the king's head. Simon, discontent with
some reason at the preference of such inferior performers, made the
famous crown-piece, which though it did not explode the others, re∣covered
his own salary, and from that time he and his rivals lived
amicably together. It was more than they themselves did. John
had three sons, the eldest of which he lost, but James and Norbert,
being much employed by him, their uncles grew jealous and left
England, Joseph going to France, Philip to Flanders, where each
being entertained by the respective governments, the three brothers
were at the same time in the service of three kings, of England, France
and Spain. James Rotier being hurt by a fall from his horse, and
retiring to Bromley for the air, caught cold and died. Norbert and
his father remained working for the crown till the Revolution, when,
though offered to be continued in his post, no sollicitation could pre∣vail
on John the father to work for king William. This rendering
him obnoxious, and there being suspicions <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There are many evidences that these and other suspicions were not ill-founded. Rotier was believed to have both coined and furnished dies for coin∣ing money, I suppose with the stamp and for the service of king James. Smith in his Memoirs of secret service mentions his information and discovery of the dies in the Tower being conveyed away by one Hewet and others, by the help of Mr. Rotier, and that they were found at Mr. Vernon's in January 1695. In the Journals of the House of Commons, vol. xi. p. 686, is a report from the Committee to examine what dies were gone out of the Tower and by what means. From that report it appears that Rotier wou'd not suffer captain Harris the patent-officer to enter the house where the dies were kept; that one Ware made a press for White, then under sentence of condemnation, who told Ware he cou'd have dies from Rotier when he pleased: that Rotier, who was a Catho∣lic, kept an Irish papist in his house, and that the lord Lucas, governor of the Tower, had complained, that the Tower was not safe, while so many papists were entertained in Rotier's house. It appears too from the Journal of Henry Earl of Clarendon, that when his lordship, who by his own account had dealt with the most disaffected persons, was committed to the Tower in 1690, he asked lord Lucas to let Rotier come to him, which the governor would not suf∣fer him to do alone, because he was a papist.—Lord Clarendon most probably had another reason for desiring Rotier's company.</NOTE> of his carrying on a trea∣sonable
<PB N="102" REF="123"/>
correspondence, guards were placed round his house in the
Tower, and lord Lucas, who commanded there, made him so uneasy
that he was glad to quit his habitation. He was rich and very infirm,
labouring under the stone and gravel, additional reasons for his re∣tiring.
He took a house in Red-lion-square. Norbert, less difficult,
executed some things for the government, particularly, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He and his brother James struck a medal of king William alone in 1693, which was advertised, with another by them of Charles 1st.</NOTE> as Vertue
thinks, the coronation medal for William and Mary, and some dies
for the copper money. On the proofs were the king's and queen's
heads on different sides, with a rose, a ship, &amp;c. but in 1694 it was
resolved, that the heads should be coupled, and Britannia be on the
reverse. Hence arose new matter of complaint—Some penetrating
eyes thought they discovered a Satyr's head <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I remember such a vision about the first half-penny of the late king George II. The knee of Britannia was thought to represent a rat (a Hanoverian one) gnawing into her bowels.</NOTE> couched in the king's.
This made much noise, and gave rise to a report that king James was
in England, and lay concealed in Rotier's house in the Tower. Nor∣bert
on these dissatisfactions left England, and retiring into France,
where he had been educated in the academy, was received and em∣ployed
<PB N="103" REF="124"/>
by Louis XIV. where, whatever had been his inclinations
here, he certainly made several medals of the young chevalier.</P>
<P>John, the father, survived king William. A medal being ordered
of the new queen, Harris a player who succeeded Rotier, and was in∣capable
of the office, employed workmen to do the business, among
whom was Mr. Croker, who afterwards obtained the place. Sir
Godfrey Kneller drew a profile of the queen, and Mr. Bird the statu∣ary
modelled it. Her majesty did not like the essay, and recollected
Rotier, but was told the family had left England or were dead. Sir
Godfrey being ordered to inspect the work, and going to the Tower,
learned that John Rotier was still living, whom he visited and ac∣quainted
with what had happened. The old man, in a passion, began
a die, but died before he could finish it, in 1703, and was buried in
the Tower. The unfinished die, with others of the twelve caesars,
were sent to France to his relations, whence two of them arrived,
hoping to be employed. One of them modelled the face of Sir Hans
Sloane, and struck a silver medal of the duke of Beaufort; but not
meeting with success, they returned. This entire account Vertue re∣ceived
in 1745 from two surviving sisters of Norbert Rotier. Their
mother, who had a portrait of her husband John, which the daughters
sent for, died in Flanders about 1720.</P>
<P>Of the works of the Rotiers, some may be seen in Evelyn. John
made a large milled medal of duke Lauderdale in 1672, with the
graver's own name. Norbert, a medal of Charles I. (struck about the
time of the Revolution) and another of his queen. One of them, I
know not which, graved a large medal of a Danish admiral, in the
reign of king James. A cornelian seal with the heads of Mars and
Venus, which Vertue saw, was cut by John Rotier. Of Joseph, there

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Artists in the Reign of James II.</HEAD>
<P>THE short and tempestuous reign of James, though he him∣self
seems to have had much inclination to them, afforded
small encouragement to the arts. His religion was not of a
complexion to exclude decoration; but four years, crouded with in∣surrections,
prosecutions, innovations, were not likely to make a figure
in a history of painting. Several performers, that had resided here
in the preceding reign, continued through that of James: such as may
peculiarly be ascribed to his short period, I shall recapitulate.</P>
<P>WILLIAM FERGUSON</P>
<P>A Scot, who lived long in Italy and France, painted still life, dead
fowl, &amp;c. while in Italy he composed two pictures, sold in Andrew
Hay's sale, representing basreliefs, antique stones, &amp;c. on which the
light was thrown, says Vertue, in a surprizing manner. His name
and the date 1679 were on them. On another was the year 1689;
<PB N="106" REF="127" MS="y"/>
for which reason I have placed him between these periods. He
worked very cheap and died here.</P>
<P>JACQUES ROUSSEAU <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">V. Graham's English School.</NOTE>,</P>
<P>Of Paris, studied first under Swanevelt, who had married one of his
relations, and then improved himself by a journey to Italy, practicing
solely in perspective, architecture and landscape. On his return home
he was employed at Marly, but being a protestant, he quitted his
work on the persecution of his brethren, and retired to Swisserland.
Louvois invited him back; he refused, but sent his designs, and re∣commended
a proper person to execute them. After a short stay in
Swisserland, he went to Holland, whence he was invited over by
Ralph duke of Montagu to adorn his new house in Bloomsbury,
where he painted much, and had the supervisal of the building, and
even a hand in it. His work amounted to 1500 <HI>l.</HI> in lieu of which
the duke allowed him an annuity for his life of 200 <HI>l.</HI> a year. He re∣ceived
it but two years, dying <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">He was buried in St. Anne's.</NOTE> in Soho-square at the age of 68 about
1694. Some of his pictures, both in landscape and architecture, are
over doors at Hampton-court; and he etched after some of his own
designs. He left a widow, but bequeathed most of what he had to
his fellow-sufferers, the Refugèes. Lord Burlington had a portrait of
him by Le Fevre.</P>
<P>CHARLES DE LA FOSSE,</P>
<P>A name little known in England, but of great celebrity in France.

The author of the Abregè calls him <HI>Un des plus grans coloristes de l'e∣cole
Francoise.</HI> He might be so, and not very excellent: colouring is
the point in which their best masters have failed. La Fosse was in∣vited
to England by the duke of Montagu, mentioned in the preced∣ing
article, and painted two cielings for him, the Apotheosis of Isis,
and an Assembly of the Gods. The French author says that king
William pressed him to stay here, but that he declined the offer, in
hopes of being appointed first painter to his own monarch. Parmen∣tiere
assisted La Fosse in laying the dead colours for him, in his works
at Montagu-house. La Fosse who arrived in the reign of James, re∣turned
at the Revolution, but came again to finish what he had begun,
and went back when he had finished.</P>
<P>N. HEUDE</P>
<P>Lived about this time, and painted in the manner of Verrio, to whom
he is said to have been assistant. He painted a stair-case at the lord
Tyrconnel's in Arlington-street, now demolished, and a cieling at
Bulstrode, in both which he placed his own portrait and name. He
was master of Mr. Carpenter, the statuary.</P>
<P>WILLIAM DE KEISAR,</P>
<P>Of Antwerp, was bred a jeweller, in which profession he became very
eminent, but having been well educated and taught to draw, he had a
strong bent towards that profession, and employed all his leisure on it,
practicing miniature, enamel, and oil-colours, both in small and large.
Vertue says he fixed at last wholly on the former: Graham that he
<PB N="108" REF="130"/>
painted in little after the manner of Elsheimer, that he imitated va∣rious
manners, drew cattle and birds, and painted tombs and basre∣liefs
in imitation of Vergazon, and that he worked some time with
Loten the landscape-painter. This last circumstance is not very pro∣bable;
for Vertue, who was acquainted with his daughter, gives a
very different account of his commencing painter by profession.
Having painted some altar-pieces at Antwerp, his business called him
to Dunkirk, where he drew a picture for the altar of the English nuns.
They were so pleased with it, that they persuaded Keisar to go to
England, and gave him letters of recommendation to lord Melfort,
then in favour with king James. The enthusiastic painter could not
resist the proposal; he embarked on board an English vessel, and
without acquainting his wife or family, sailed for England. His re∣ception
was equal to his wishes. He was introduced to the king who
promised to countenance him, and several persons of rank, who had
known him at Antwerp, encouraged him in his new vocation. Tran∣sported
with his prospect, he sent for his wife, ordering her to dismiss
his workmen, and convert his effects into money.—Within half a year
the bubble burst; the Revolution happened, Keisar's friends could no
longer be his protectors, his business decreased, and the pursuit of the
Philosopher's stone, to which he had recourse in his despair, compleated
his ruin. He died at the age of 45 in four or five years after the Re∣volution.
He left a daughter whom he had taken great pains to in∣struct
in his favorite study, and with success. She painted small por∣traits
in oil and copied well; but marrying one Mr. Humble a gen∣tleman,
he would not permit her to follow the prosession. After his
death she returned to it, and died in December 1724. She had seve∣ral
pictures by her father's hand, particularly a St. Catherine, painted

<P><GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> LARGILLIERE</P>
<P>A French portrait-painter, was in England in this reign, but went
away on the Revolution. He drew the king and queen, Sir John
Warner, his daughter, and grand-daughter, and Vander Meulen and
Sybrecht the painters. Vertue mentions a small piece (about two feet
and an half high) highly finished by him representing himself, his
wife and two children. The painter is standing and leans on a pedes∣tal;
his wife is sitting; one of the children stands, the other sits play∣ing
with fruit and flowers: there is a peacock, and a landscape be∣hind
them.</P>
<P>JOHN SYBRECHT <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vertue saw a picture at the duke of Portland's by this master, on which he wrote his name J. Siberechts, 1676. I have writ it as it is commonly spelt, to prevent confusion.</NOTE></P>
<P>Of Antwerp, painted landscapes, and had studied the views on the
Rhine, his drawings of which in water-colours are more common than
his pictures. The duke of Buckingham returning through Flanders
from his embassy to Paris, found Sybrecht at Antwerp, was pleased
with his works, invited him to England and employed him at Clief∣den.
In 1686 he made several views of Chatsworth. At Newstede-abbey,
lord Byron's, are two pieces by this hand; the first, a land∣scape
in the style of Rubens's school; the other, which is better, a
<PB N="110" REF="133" MS="y"/>
prospect of Longleate, not unlike the manner of Wouverman. Sy∣brecht
died in 1703, aged 73, and was buried in St. James's.</P>
<P>HENRY TILSON</P>
<P>Was grandson of Henry Tilson bishop of Elphin, born in Yorkshire,
and who died in 1655. Young Henry was bred under Sir Peter
Lely, after whose death he went to Italy in company with Dahl, and
staid seven years, copying the works of the best masters with great di∣ligence.
He succeeded in portraits, both oil and crayons, and was
likely to make a figure, when he grew disordered in his senses and
shot himself at the age of 36. He was buried at St. Dunstan's in the
West. He painted his own portrait two or three times; once with a
pencil in his hand leaning on a bust. Behind it was written H. Til∣sona.
Roma, 1687. He drew a large family-picture, of his father,
mother, a younger brother, a sister and himself. Dahl gave Tilson
his own picture, inscribed behind, "Memoria per mio caro amico

Tower-street St. Giles's, near the Seven-dials, and died at the age of
33. His widow married Van Ost of Mechlin, another statuary. Quel∣lin's

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Painters in the Reign of King William.</HEAD>
<P>THIS prince, like most of those in our annals, contributed
nothing to the advancement of arts. He was born in a
country where taste never flourished, and nature had not given
it to him as an embellishment to his great qualities. He courted
Fame, but none of her ministers. Holland owed it't preservation to
his heroic virtue, England it's liberty to his ambition, Europe it's in∣dependence
to his competition with Louis the fourteenth; for, how∣ever
unsuccessful in the contest, the very struggle was salutary. Being
obliged to draw all his resources from himself, and not content to ac∣quire
glory by proxy, he had no leisure, like his rival, to preside over
the registers of his fame. He fought his own battles, instead of
choosing mottoes for the medals that recorded them; and though my
lord Halifax promised <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It has been observed that I have misquoted lord Halifax, who does not pro∣mise king William an immortality in tapestry for his wound, but tells him, the French would have flattered him in that manner. It is very true: I mistook, quoting only by memory, and happily not being very accurately read in so indif∣ferent an author. The true reading is but more applicable to my purpose. Who∣ever delights in such piddling criticisms, and is afterwards capable of reasoning from a passage when he has rectified it, may amuse himself in setting this right. I leave the passage wrong as it stood at first, in charity to such Commentators.</NOTE> him that his wound in the battle of the Boyne <Q>Should run for ever purple in our looms,</Q><PB N="113" REF="137"/>
His majesty certainly did not bespeak a single suit of tapestry in me∣mory
of the action. In England he met with nothing but disgusts.
He understood little of the nation, and seems to have acted too much
upon a plan formed before he came over, and however necessary to
his early situation, little adapted to so peculiar a people as the English.
He thought that valour and taciturnity would conquer or govern the
world, and vainly imagining that his new subjects loved liberty better
than party, he trusted to their feeling gratitude for a blessing which
they could not help seeing was conferred a little for his own sake.
Reserved, unsociable, ill in his health, and sowered by his situation,
he sought none of those amusements that make the hours of the happy
much happier. If we must except the palace at Hampton-court, at
least it is no monument of his taste; it seems erected in emulation of,
what it certainly was meant to imitate, the pompous edifices of the
French monarch. We are told that <Q><L>—Great Nassau to Kneller's hand decreed</L>
<L>To fix him gracefull on the bounding steed:</L></Q>In general I believe his majesty patronized neither painters, nor <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">King William had so little leisure to attend to, or so little disposition to men of wit, that when St. Evremont was introduced to him, the king said coldly, "I think you was a major-general in the French service."</NOTE>

<PB N="114" REF="138"/>
a great prince may have a Garth, a Prior, a Montagu, and want
Titians and Vandycks, if he encourages neither—You must address
yourself to a painter, if you wish to be flattered—a poet brings his
incense to you. Mary seems to have had little more propensity to the
arts than the king: the good queen loved to work and talk, and con∣tented
herself with praying to God that her husband might be a great
hero, since he did not chuse to be a fond husband. A few men of
genius flourished in their time, of whom the chief was</P>
<P>Sir GODFREY KNELLER,</P>
<P>A man lessened by his own reputation, as he chose to make it subser∣vient
to his fortune <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The author of the Abregè says, that Kneller preferred portrait-painting for this reason. "Painters of history, said he, make the dead live, and do not begin to live themselves till they are dead.—I paint the living and they make me live."</NOTE>. Had he lived in a country where his merit
had been rewarded according to the worth of his productions, instead
of the number, he might have shone in the roll of the greatest mas∣ters;
but he united the highest vanity with the most consummate ne∣gligence
of character—at least, where he offered one picture to
fame, he sacrificed twenty to lucre; and he met with customers of so
little judgment, that they were fond of being painted by a man, who
would gladly have disowned his works the moment they were
paid for. Ten <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Charles II. James II. and his queen; William and Mary, Anne, George I. Louis XIV. Peter the Great, and the emperor Charles VI.

When he had finished the picture of Louis XIV, that prince asked him what mark of his esteem wou'd be most agreable to him? he answered modestly and genteely, that if his majesty would bestow a quarter of an hour on him, that he might make a drawing of his head for himself, he should think it the highest honour he could possibly receive. The king complied, and the painter drew him on grey paper with black and red chalk heightened with white.</NOTE> sovereigns sat to him; not one of them discovered

that he was fit for more than preserving their likeness. We however,
who see king William, the Czar Peter, Marlborough, Newton, Dry∣den,
Godolphin, Somers, the duchess of Grafton, lady Ranelagh, and
so many ornaments of an illustrious age, transmitted to us by Kneller's
pencil, must not regret that his talent was confined to portraits—
Perhaps the treasure is greater, than if he had decorated the chambers
of Hampton-court with the wars of Aeneas or the enchanted palace of
Armida: and when one considers how seldom great masters are wor∣thily
employed, it is better to have real portraits, than Madonnas
without end. My opinion of what Sir Godfrey's genius could have
produced, must not be judged by the historic picture of king William
in the palace just mentioned: it is a tame and poor performance. But
the original sketch of it at Houghton is struck out with a spirit and
fire equal to Rubens. The hero and the horse are in the heat of battle:
In the large piece, it is the king riding in triumph, with his usual
phlegm. Of all his works, Sir Godfrey was most proud of the con∣verted
Chinese at Windsor; but his portrait of Gibbons is superior to
it. It has the freedom and nature of Vandyck, with the harmony of
colouring peculiar to Andrea Sacchi; and no part of it is neglected.
In general, even where he took pains, all the parts are affectedly kept
down, to throw the greater force into the head—a trick unworthy so
<PB N="116" REF="141"/>
great a master. His draperies too are so <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He sometimes, in the haste of finishing, left part of the primed cloath un∣coloured. This fault, which in Kneller proceeded from haste and rapaciousness, was affectedly imitated by some of the painters who succeeded him, while his great reputation was still in vogue. Yet with all Sir Godfrey's desire of acquiring riches, he left 500 portraits unfinished—for his customers were not equally ready to pay, as to sit. There is an entertaining account of these facts in Rouquet's State of the Arts in England.</NOTE> carelesly finished, that they
resemble no silk or stuff the world ever saw. His airs of heads have
extreme grace; the hair admirably disposed, and if the locks seem un∣naturally
elevated, it must be considered as an instance of the painter's
art. He painted in an age when the women erected edifices of three
stories on their heads. Had he represented such preposterous attire,
in half a century his works would have been ridiculous. To lower
their dress to a natural level when the eye was accustomed to pyra∣mids,
would have shocked their prejudices and diminished the resem∣blance.—He
took a middle way and weighed out ornament to them
of more natural materials. Still it must be owned, there is too great
a sameness in his airs, and no imagination at all in his compositions.
See but a head, it interests you—uncover the rest of the canvass, you
wonder faces so expressive could be employed so insipidly. In truth,
the age demanded nothing correct, nothing compleat. Capable of
tasting the power of Dryden's numbers, and the majesty of Kneller's
heads, it overlooked doggrel and daubing. What pity that men of
fortune are not blest with such a pen or such a pencil! That a genius
must write for a bookseller, or paint for an alderman!</P>
<P>Sir Godfrey Kneller was born at Lubec, about the year 1648. His
<PB N="117" REF="142"/>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">V. Buckeridge's edition of De Piles, and of Graham's English School, in which he has inserted a new life of Sir Godfrey, p. 393.</NOTE> grandfather had an estate near Hall in Saxony; was surveyor gene∣ral
of the mines and inspector of count Mansfeldt's revenues. By his
wife of the family of Crowsen, he had one son Zachary, educated at
Leipsic, and for some time in the service of Gustavus Adolphus's
widow. After her death, he removed to Lubec, married, professed
architecture, and was chief surveyor to his native City. He left two
sons, John Zachary, and Godfrey. The latter, who at first was de∣signed
for a military life, was sent to Leyden, where he applied to
mathematics and fortification; but the predominance of nature deter∣mining
him to painting, his father acquiesced and sent him to Amster∣dam,
where he studied under Bol, and had some instructions from
Rembrandt. Vertue nor any of his biographers take notice of it,
nor do I assert it, but I have heard that one of his masters was
Francis Hals. It is certain that Kneller had no servility of a disciple,
nor imitated any of them. Even in Italy whither he went in 1672,
he mimicked no peculiar style, nor even at Venice where he resided
most and was esteemed and employed by some of the first families,
and where he drew cardinal Bassadonna. If he caught any thing, it
was instructions not hints. If I see the least resemblance in his works
to any other master, it is in some of his earliest works in England,
and those his best, to Tintoret. A portrait at Houghton of Joseph
Carreras, a poet and chaplain to Catherine of Lisbon, has the force
and simplicity of that master, without owing part of it's merit to Tin∣toret's
universal black drapery, to his own, afterwards, neglected
draperies, or to his master Rembrandt's unnatural Chiaro Scuro.
Latterly Sir Godfrey was thought to give into the manner of Rubens;
<PB N="118" REF="143"/>
I see it no where but in the sketch of king William's equestrian figure,
evidently imitated from Rubens's design of the cieling for the Ban∣quetting-house,
which, as I have said, in the life of that painter, was
in Kneller's possession. The latter had no more of Rubens's rich
colouring, than of Vandyck's delicacy in habits; but he had more
beauty than the latter, more dignity than Sir Peter Lely. The latter
felt his capacity in a memorable instance; Kneller and his brother
came to England in 1674 without intending to reside here, but to re∣turn
through France to Venice. They were recommended to Mr.
Banks, a Hamburgh-merchant, and Godfrey drew him and his family.
The pictures pleased. Mr. Vernon, secretary to the duke of Mon∣mouth,
saw them, and sat to the new painter, and obtained his mas∣ter's
picture by the same hand. The duke was so charmed, that he
engaged the king his father to sit to Kneller, at a time that the duke
of York had been promised the king's picture by Lely. Charles un∣willing
to have double trouble, proposed that both the artists should
draw him at the same time. Lely as an established master, chose the
light he liked: the stranger was to draw the picture as he could; and
performed it with such facility and expedition, that his piece was in a
manner finished, when Lely's was only dead-coloured. The novelty
pleased—yet Lely deserved most honour, for he did justice to his
new competitor; confessed his abilities and the likeness. This suc∣cess
fixed Kneller here. The series of his portraits prove the continu∣ance
of his reputation.</P>
<P>Charles II. sent him to Paris to draw Louis XIV. but died in his
absence. The successor was equally favorable to him, and was sitting
for his picture for secretary Pepys, when he received the news that the
prince of Orange was landed.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="144" MS="y"/>
King William distinguished Kneller still more; for <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They were painted in his reign, but the thought was the queen's, during one of the king's absences; and contributed much to make her unpopular, as I have heard from the authority of the old countess of Carlisle (daughter of Arthur earl of Essex) who died within these few years and remembered the event. She added, that the famous lady Dorchester advised the queen against it, saying, "Madam, if the king was to ask for the portraits of all the wits in his court, wou'd not the rest think he called them fools?"</NOTE> that prince he
painted the beauties at Hampton-court, and was knighted by him in
1692, with the additional present of a gold medal and chain weighing

queen Anne he painted the king of Spain, afterwards Charles VI.
so poor a performance that one would think he felt the fall from Peter
to Charles. His works in the gallery of <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Seven of those heads are by Kneller, the rest by Dahl.</NOTE> Admirals were done in the
same reign, and several of them worthy so noble a memorial. The
Kit-cat-club, generally mentioned as a set of wits, in reality the patri∣ots
that saved Britain, were Kneller's last works in that reign, and his
last public work. He lived to draw George I. was made a baronet
by him, and continued to paint during the greater part of his reign;
but in 1722 Sir Godfrey was seized with a violent fever, from the im∣mediate
danger of which he was rescued by Dr. Meade. The hu∣mour
however fell on his left arm; and it was opened. He remained
in a languishing condition and died Oct. 27, 1723. His body lay in
state, and was buried at Witton, but a monument was erected in
Westminster-abbey <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">His monument, executed by Rysbrach, was directed by himself; he lest 300<HI>l.</HI> for it.</NOTE>, where his friend Mr. Pope, as if to gratify an
extravagant vanity dead, which he had ridiculed living, bestowed on

him a translation of Raphael's epitaph—as high a compliment as even
poetry could be allowed to pay to the original; a silly hyperbole
when applied to the modern. This was not the only instance in which
the poet incensed the painter. Sir Godfrey had drawn for him the
statues of Apollo, Venus and Hercules; Pope paid for them with these
lines,<Q><L>What god, what genius did the pencil move,</L>
<L>When Kneller painted these!</L>
<L>'Twas friendship, warm as Phaebus, kind as love,</L>
<L>And strong as Hercules.</L></Q>He was in the right to suppress them—what idea does muscular
friendship convey? It was not the same <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pope's character of Helluo is believed to allude to Sir Godfrey.</NOTE> warmth of friendship that
made Pope put Kneller's vanity to the strongest trial imaginable. The
former laid a wager that there was no flattery so gross but his friend
would swallow. To prove it, Pope said to him as he was painting,
"Sir Godfrey, I believe if God Almighty had had your assistance,
the world would have been formed more perfect." "Fore God, Sir,
replied Kneller, I believe so." This impious answer was not extraor∣dinary
in the latter.—His conversation on religion was extremely
free.—His <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In the same strain he said to a low fellow whom he over-heard cursing him∣self; "God damn <HI>you</HI>! God may damn the duke of Marlborough, and perhaps Sir Godfrey Kneller; but do you think he will take the trouble of damning such a scoundrel as you!" The same vanity that cou'd think itself intitled to preemi∣nence even in horrors, alighted on a juster distinction, when he told his taylor, who offended him by proposing his son for an apprentice, "Dost thou think, man, <HI>I</HI> can make thy son a painter! No; God almighty only makes painters."</NOTE> paraphrase on a particular text of scripture, singular. "In
my father's house are many mansions;" which Sir Godfrey interpre∣ted
<PB N="121" REF="146"/>
thus. "At the day of judgment, said he, God will examine man∣kind
on their different professions: to one he will say, Of what sect
was you? I was a Papist—go you there. What was you? A Pro∣testant—go
you there.—And you?—A Turk—go you there.—And
you, Sir Godfrey?—I was of no sect—then God will say, Sir Godfrey,
chuse your place." His wit was ready; his bonmots deservedly ad∣mired.
In great Queen-street <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He first lived in Durham-yard, then 21 years in Covent-garden, and lastly in great Queen-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields.</NOTE> he lived next door to Dr. Ratcliffe;
Kneller was fond of flowers, and had a fine collection. As there was
great intimacy between him and the physician, he permitted the latter
to have a door into his garden, but Ratcliffe's servants gathering and
destroying the flowers, Kneller sent him word he must shut up the door.
—Ratcliffe replied peevishly, "Tell him he may do any thing with
it but paint it.—And I, answered Sir Godfrey, can take any thing
from him but physic." Sir Godfrey at Witton acted as Justice of
Peace, and was so much more swayed by Equity than Law, that his
judgments accompanied with humour are said to have occasioned those
lines by Pope.<Q><L>I think Sir Godfrey should decide the suit,</L>
<L>Who sent the Thief (that stole the cash) away,</L>
<L>And punish'd him that put it in his way.</L></Q>This alluded to his dismissing a soldier who had stolen a joint of meat,
and accused the butcher of having tempted him by it. Whenever Sir
Godfrey was applied to, to determine what parish a poor man belong∣ed
to, he always inquired which parish was the richer, and settled the
poor man there; nor wou'd ever sign a warrant to distrain the goods
<PB N="122" REF="147"/>
of a poor man, who could not pay a tax. These instances showed
the goodness of his heart; others, even in his capacity of justice, his
peculiar turn; a handsome young woman came before him to swear a
rape; struck with her beauty, he continued examining her, as he sat
painting, till he had taken her likeness. If he disliked interruption,
he would not be interrupted. Seeing a constable coming to him at
the head of a mob, he called to him, without inquiring into the af∣fair;
"Mr. Constable, you see that turning; go that way, and you
will find an ale-house, the sign of the king's head—go, and make
it up."</P>
<P>He married Susannah Cawley, daughter of the minister of Henley
upon Thames. She out-lived him and was buried at Henley, where
are monuments for her and her father. Before his marriage, Sir
Godfrey had an intrigue with a Quaker's wife, whom he purchased of
her husband, and had a daughter, whose portrait he drew like St. Agnes
with a lamb; there is a print of it by Smith. Kneller had amassed a
great fortune, though he lived magnificently, and lost 20,000<HI>l.</HI> in the
South-sea; yet he had an estate of near 2000<HI>l.</HI> a year left. Part he
bequeathed to his wife, and entailed the rest on Godfrey Huckle, his
daughter's son, with orders that he should assume the name of Knel∣ler.
To three neices at Hamburgh, the children of his brother, he
left legacies; and an annuity of 100<HI>l.</HI> a year to Bing, an old servant,
who with his brother had been his Assistants. Of these he had many,
as may be concluded from the quantity of his works, and the badness
of so many. His chief performers were, Pieters, Vander Roer, and
Bakker—sometimes he employed Baptist and Vergazon. His prices
were fifteen guineas for a head, twenty if with one hand, thirty for a
half, and sixty for a whole length.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="148"/>
Kneller frequently drew his own portrait; my father had one, a
head when young, and a small one of the same age, very masterly; it
is now mine. It was engraved by Becket. Another in a wig; by
Smith. A half-length sent to the Tuscan gallery. A half-length in
a brocaded waistcoat with his gold chain; there is a mezzotinto of it,
accompanying the Kit-cat-heads. Another head with a cap; a half∣length
presented to the gallery at Oxford, and a double piece of him∣self
and his wife. Great numbers of his works have been engraved,
particularly by Smith, who has more than done justice to them; the
draperies are preferable to the originals. The first print taken from
his works was by White of Charles II. He had an historic piece of
his own painting before he went to Italy, Tobit and the Angel. At
his seat at Witton were many of his own works, sold some years after
his death. He intended that Sir James Thornhill should paint the
staircase there, but hearing that Sir Isaac Newton was sitting to Thorn∣hill,
Kneller was offended, said, no portrait-painter should paint his
house, and employed Laguerre.</P>
<P>Pope was not the only bard that soothed this painter's vain-glory.
Dryden repaid him for a present of Shakespeare's picture with a copy
of verses full of luxuriant but immortal touches; the most beautiful
of Addison's poetic works was addressed to him: the singular happi∣ness
of the allusions, and applications of fabulous theology to the prin∣ces
drawn by Kneller, is very remarkable:<Q><L>Great Pan, who wont to chase the fair,</L>
<L>And love the spreading oak was there,</L></Q>For Charles II.—And for James,</P>
<P><Q><L>Old Saturn too with upcast eyes</L>
<L>Beheld his abdicated skies.</L></Q><PB N="124" REF="149"/>
And the rest on William and Mary, Anne, and George I. are all
stamped with the most just resemblance.</P>
<P>Prior complimented Kneller on the duke of Ormond's picture;
Steele wrote a poem to him at Witton; Tickell another; and there
is one in the third part of Miscellaneous Poems 8vo. Lond. 1693, on
the portrait of the lady Hyde. Can one wonder a man was vain, who
had been flattered by Dryden, Addison, Prior, Pope and Steele? Jo∣seph
Harris dedicated to him his Tragi-comedy of the Mistakes or
False Report in 1690, in which Dryden, Tate, and Mountford had
assisted. And John Smith (I suppose the celebrated mezzotinter) ad∣dressed
his translation of Le Brun's Conference on the Passions to Sir
Godfrey. On his death was written another Poem printed in a Mis∣cellany
published by D. Lewis, 8vo. in 1726. His Brother</P>
<P>JOHN ZACHARY KNELLER,</P>
<P>Who was thirteen years older than Sir Godfrey, came to England with
him, and painted in fresco, architecture, and still-life, small pieces in
oil, and lastly in water-colours, in which he copied several of his bro∣ther's
heads. Sir Godfrey drew his portrait, one of his best works.
Of John's was a piece of still-life with a great tankard in the mid∣dle;
and a small head of Wyck, almost profile in oil, in the possession
of Dr. Barnard bishop of Derry, with the names of both artists, dated
1684. John Kneller died in 1702 in Covent-garden and was buried
in that church.</P>
<P>JOHN JAMES BAKKER</P>
<P>Painted draperies for Kneller, and went to Brussels with him in 1697,
<PB N="125" REF="150"/>
where Sir Godfrey drew the elector of Bavaria on a white horse. I
don't know whether Bakker ever practiced for himself. He was bro∣ther
of Adrian Bakker, who painted history and portraits at Amster∣dam
and died in 1686.</P>
<P>JACOB VANDER ROER,</P>
<P>Another of Kneller's assistants, was scholar of J. De Baan, and lived
many years in London; died at Dort. See an account of him in the
third volume of Descamps.</P>
<P>JOHN PIETERS</P>
<P>Was born at Antwerp, and learned of Eykens, a history-painter. He
came to England in 1685, at the age of eighteen <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was so poor that he engaged himself as a domestic in the service of cardi∣nal Dada, the pope's nuntio; but quitted him before night.</NOTE>, and was recom∣mended
to Sir Godfrey, for whom he painted draperies, and whom he
quitted in 1712, and was employed in the same service by others;
but his chief business was in mending drawings and old pictures, in
which he was very <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">He excelled in copying Rubens, and even passed off several prints, which he had washed, for original drawings of that master.

Pieters and Bakker were both kind to
Vertue in his youth, and gave him instructions, which he acknow∣ledges
with great gratitude. Pieters loved his bottle, and was impro∣vident,
and towards the end of his life was poor and gouty. He died
in 1727, and was buried in the church-yard of St. Martin's.

</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="151"/>JOHN BAPTIST MONOYER <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">V. Graham, and the Abregè.</NOTE>,</P>
<P>One of the greatest masters that has appeared for painting flowers.
They are not so exquisitely finished as Van Huysum's, but his colour∣ing
and composition are in a bolder style. He was born at Lisle in
1635, and educated at Antwerp as a painter of history, which he soon
changed for flowers, and going to Paris in 1663 was received into the
academy with applause; and though his subjects were not thought
elevated enough to admit him to a professorship, he was in considera∣tion
of his merit made a counsellor; a silly distinction, as if a great
painter in any branch, was not sitter to profess that branch, than give
advice on any other. He was employed at Versailles, Trianon, Marly,
and Meudon; and painted in the hotel de Bretonvilliers at Paris, and
other houses. The duke of Montagu brought him to England, where
much of his hand is to be seen, at Montagu-house, Hampton-court,
the duke of St. Albans's at Windsor, Kensington, lord Carlisle's, Bur∣lington-house,
&amp;c. The author of the Abregè speaking of Baptist,
La Fosse and Rousseau, says, these three French painters have extort∣ed
a sincere confession from the English, "Qu'on ne peut aller plus
loin en fait de peinture." Baptist is undoubtedly capital in his way—
but they must be ignorant Englishmen indeed, who can see any thing
masterly in the two others. Baptist passed and repassed several times
between France and England, but having married his daughter to a
French painter who was suffered to alter and touch upon his pictures,
Baptist was offended and returned to France no more. He died in
Pallmall in 1699. His son Antony, called young Baptist, painted in
his father's manner, and had merit. There is a good print by White

<P>HENRY VERGAZON <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">V. Graham.</NOTE>,</P>
<P>A Dutch painter of ruins and landscapes, with which he sometimes
was called to adorn the back-grounds of Kneller's pictures, though his
colouring was reckoned too dark. He painted <HI>a few</HI> small portraits,
and died in France.</P>
<P>PHILIP BOUL,</P>
<P>A name of whom I find but one note. Vertue says he had seen a
pocket-book almost full of sketches and views of Derbyshire, the
Peak, Chatsworth, &amp;c. very freely touched and in imitation of Salvator
Rosa, whose works this person studied. Whether he executed any
thing in painting I know not.</P>
<P>EDWARD DUBOIS,</P>
<P>Was born at Antwerp, and studied under Groenwegen, a landscape-painter,
who had been in Italy, and several years in <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">So Graham. I find no other account of this Groenwegen, nor of his works here.</NOTE> England—a
course of travels pursued by the disciple, who after a stay of eight
years in the former, where he studied the antique, and painted for
Charles Emanuel duke of Savoy, came to England, where he professed
<PB N="128" REF="154" MS="y"/>
landscape and history-painting. He died here about 1699, at the
age of 77, and was buried at St. Giles's. His younger brother,</P>
<P>SIMON DUBOIS,</P>
<P>Was a better master. He lived 25 years at home, but came to
England as early as 1685, several small heads in oil being dated in
that year; they are commonly distinguished by the fashion of that
time, laced cravats. Portrait however was not his excellence; origi∣nally
he painted battles, small, and in the Italian manner; afterwards,
horses <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He had received some instructions from Wouverman.</NOTE> and cattle, with figures, the faces of which were so neatly
finished, that a lady persuaded him to try likenesses, and sat to him
herself. He sold many of his pieces for originals by Italian hands,
saying sensibly, that since the world would not do him justice, he
would do it himself; his works sold well, when his name was con∣cealed.
Lord Somers distinguished better; he went unknown and
sat to Dubois; and going away gave him 50 guineas, ordered the
robes of chancellor, and when the picture <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Elsum has an epigram on this picture.</NOTE> was finished, gave him
as much more. The two brothers lived together in Covent-garden
without any servant, working in obscurity, and heaping up money,
both being avaricious. When Edward died, Simon, left without
society, began to work for Vandevelde, and one day in a fit of gene∣rosity,
offered to draw the portrait of his eldest daughter. This drew
on a nearer acquaintance, and the old man married her, but died in a
year, leaving her his money, and a fine collection of pictures, and
naming his patron lord Somers executor; he was buried May 26,
1708. His young widow married again, and dissipated the fortune

and collection. Dubois drew a whole length of archbishop Tenison,
now at Lambeth, and Vandervaart the painter had his own head by
himself.</P>
<P>HENRY COOKE</P>
<P>Was born in 1642, and was thought to have a talent for history. He
went to Italy, and studied under Salvator Rosa. On his return,
neither rich nor known, he lived obscurely in Knave's-acre, in part∣nership
with a house-painter. Lutterel introduced him to Sir Godfrey
Copley, who was pleased with his works, and carried him into York∣shire
where he was building a new house, in which Cooke painted, and
received 150<HI>l.</HI> He then lived five years with the father of Antony
Russel, whom I have mentioned in the preceding volume, but quarrel∣ling
with a man about a mistress whom Cooke kept, by whom he had
children, and whom he afterwards married, Cooke killed him and
fled. He then went to Italy and staid seven years, and returning, lived
privately, till the affair was forgot. Towards the end of his life he
was much employed. By order of King William he repaired the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Graham says he copied the Cartoons in turpentine oil, in the manner of distemper, a way he invented.</NOTE>
Cartoons, and other pictures in the royal collection, though Walton
had the salary. He finished the equestrian portrait of Charles II. at
Chelsea-college, and painted the choir of New-college-chapel, Ox∣ford,
the staircase at Ranelagh-house, the cieling of a great room at
the water-works at Islington, and the staircase at lord Carlisle's in
Soho-square, where the assemblies are now kept <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Among Elsum's epigrams is one on a listening faun by Cooke.</NOTE>. He had some∣times
<PB N="130" REF="157" MS="y"/>
painted portraits, but was soon disgusted with that business, from
the caprices of those that sat to him. He died Nov. 18, 1700, and
was buried at St. Giles's. I have his own head by him, touched with
spirit, but too dark, and the colouring not natural.</P>
<P>PETER BERCHETT</P>
<P>Was born in France, 1659, and beginning to draw at the age of 15
under La Fosse, he improved so fast, that in three years he was em∣ployed
in the royal palaces. He came to England in 1681, to work
under Rambour, a French painter of architecture, who, says Vertue,
was living in 1721, but then staid only a year, and returned to Marli.
He came again, and painted for some persons of rank in the west.
King William building a palace at Loo, sent Berchett thither, where
he was engaged fifteen months, and then came a third time to Eng∣land,
where he had sufficient business. He painted the cieling in the
chapel of Trinity-college, Oxford, the staircase at the duke of Schom∣berg's
in Pallmall, and the summer-house at Ranelagh. His drawings
in the academy were much approved. Towards the end of his life,
being troubled with a ptysic, he retired to Marybone and painted
only small pieces of fabulous history; his last was a bacchanalian, to
which he put his name the day before he died; it was in January
1720, at Marybone, where he was buried. He left a son that died
soon after him at the age of seventeen.</P>
<P>LOUIS CHERON,</P>
<P>Born at Paris in 1660, was son of Henry Cheron, an enamel painter,
<PB N="131" REF="158" MS="y"/>
and brother of Elizabeth Sophia Cheron, an admired paintress, and
who engraved many ancient gems. Louis went to Italy, and says the
* author of his life, "A toujours cherchè Raphael &amp; Jules Romain."
—A pursuit in which he was by no means successfull. He came to
England on account of his religion in 1695, and was employed at the
duke of Montagu's at Boughton, at Burleigh, and at Chatsworth,
where he painted the sides of the gallery, a very poor performance.
He had before fallen into disesteem, when he painted at Montagu-house,
where he was much surpassed by Baptist, Rousseau and La
Fosse. On this ill-success he turned to painting small histories; but
his best employment was designing for the painters and engravers of
that time; few books appeared with plates, but from his drawings.
Vanderbank, Vandergutch, Simpson, Kirkall, &amp;c. all made use of
him. His drawings are said to be preferable to his paintings. He
etched several of his own designs, as the labours of Hercules, which
were afterwards retouched with the burin by his disciple, Gerard Van∣dergutch;
and towards the end of his life Cheron etched from his
own drawings a suite of twenty-two small histories for the life of
David; they were done for, or at least afterwards purchased by P. F.
Giffart, a bookseller at Paris, who applied them to a version of the
Psalms in French metre, published in 1715. Some time before his
death, Cheron sold his drawings from Raphael, and his academic
figures to the earl of Derby for a large sum. He was a man of a fair
character, and dying in 1713 of an apoplexy, left 20<HI>l.</HI> a year to his
maid, and the rest of his fortune to his relations and to charitable uses.
He was buried from his lodgings in the piazza of Covent-garden,
and lies in the great porch of that church.

</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="159"/>JOHN RILEY</P>
<P>One of the best native painters that has flourished in England, whose
talents while living were obscured by the fame, rather than by the
merit of Kneller, and depressed since by being confounded with Lely;
an honour unlucky to his reputation. Graham too speaks of him
with little justice, saying he had no excellence beyond a head; which
is far from true. I have seen both draperies and hands painted by
Riley, that would do honour to either Lely or Kneller. The portrait
of lord-keeper North at Wroxton is capital throughout. Riley, who
was humble, modest, and of an amiable character, had the greatest
diffidence of himself, and was easily disgusted with his own works,
the source probably of the objections made to him. With a quarter
of Sir Godfrey's vanity, he might have persuaded the world he was as
great a master.</P>
<P>He was born <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">One Thomas Riley was an Actor, and has a copy of verses addressed to him in Randolph's poems. This might be the painter's father. In the same place are some Latin verses by Riley, whom I take to be our painter himself.</NOTE> in 1646, and received instructions from Fuller and
Zoust, but was little noticed till the death of Lely, when Chiffinch
being persuaded to sit to him, the picture was shown, and recom∣mended
him to the king. Charles sat to him, but almost discouraged
the bashfull artist from pursuing a profession so proper for him.
Looking at the picture he cried "Is this like me? then, od's fish, I
am an ugly fellow." This discouraged Riley so much, that he could
not bear the picture, though he sold it for a large price. James and
his queen sat to him. So did their successors, and appointed him

their painter. But the gout put an early end to Riley's progress: He
died in 1691 at the age of 45, and was buried in Bishopsgate-church;
in which parish he was born. Richardson married a near relation of
Riley, and inherited about 800<HI>l.</HI> in pictures, drawings and effects.</P>
<P>JOHN CLOSTERMAN.</P>
<P>Son of a painter, was born at Osnabrugh, and with his countryman,
one Tiburen, went to Paris in 1679, where he worked for De Troye.
In 1681, they came to England, and Closterman at first painted dra∣peries
for Riley, and afterwards they painted in conjunction, Riley still
executing most of the heads. On his death Closterman finished seve∣ral
of his pictures, which recommended him to the duke of Somerset,
who had employed Riley. He painted the duke's children, but lost
his favour on a dispute about a picture of Guercino which he had
bought for his grace, and which was afterwards purchased by lord
Halifax; and on which occasion the duke patronized Dahl. Closter∣man
however did not want business. He drew Gibbons the carver
and his wife in one <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is a mezzotinto from it.</NOTE> piece, which pleased, and Closterman was even
set in competition with Sir Godfrey. He painted the duke and
duchess of Marlborough and all their children in one picture, and the
duke on horse-back, on which subject however he had so many dis∣putes
with the duchess, that the duke said, "It has given me more
trouble to reconcile my wife and you, than to fight a battle." Clos∣terman,
who sought reputation, went to Spain, where he drew the
king and queen, and from whence he wrote several letters on the pic∣tures
in that country to Mr. Richard Graham. He also went twice
<PB N="134" REF="162" MS="y"/>
to Italy, and brought over several good pictures. The whole length
of queen Anne at Guildhall is by him, and another at Chatsworth of
the first duke of Rutland; and in Painter's-hall a portrait of Mr.
Saunders. Elsum has bestowed an epigram on his portrait of Dryden;
yet Closterman was a very moderate performer; his colouring strong,
but heavy, and his pictures without any idea of grace. Latterly he
married a woman who wasted his fortune, and disordered his under∣standing:
He died sometime after 1710, and was buried in Covent∣garden
where he lived.</P>
<P>WILLIAM DERYKE <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Graham.</NOTE>,</P>

<P>Of Harlem, a buffoon painter, was scholar of De Grebber, but lived

patronized by lord Rochester, and died in London 1704, leaving a
son of his profession.</P>
<P>FREDERIC <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">I have been told that his true name was Casaubon, and that he was descend∣ed from, or allied to the learned men of that appellation.</NOTE> KERSEBOOM.</P>
<P>Was born at Solingen in Germany in 1632, and went to Amsterdam
<PB N="136" REF="165" MS="y"/>
to study painting, and from thence to Paris in 1650, where he worked
for some years under Le Brun, till he was sent to Rome at the ex∣pence
of the chancellor of France, who maintained him there four∣teen
years, two of which he passed with Nicolo Poussin, whose man∣ner
he imitated; not so well, I should suppose, as Graham asserts,
since having been supported so long by a French minister, he probably
would have fixed in France if he had made any progress proportion∣able
to that expence. On the contrary he came to England to paint
history, in which not meeting with much encouragement, he turned
to portraits. Graham says he was the first who brought over the art
of painting on glass.—I suppose he means, painting on looking-glass.
Kerseboom died in London in 1690, and was buried in St.
Andrew's Holbourn.</P>
<P>SEVONYANS,</P>
<P>A name <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He is often called Schonians, by which appellation he is recorded in the printed catalogue of the collection in the gallery at Dusseldorp, where are three or four pieces painted by him, particularly his own head with a long beard.</NOTE> of which I have heard, but can learn nothing, except that he
painted a staircase in a house called little Montagu-house, the corner

where he drew portraits for several years. The earl of Leven encou∣raged
him to go to Scotland, and procured him a subscription of 500<HI>l.</HI>
worth of business. He went, carrying a large number of bodies and
postures, to which he painted heads. He came to England for a short
time, but returned to and died in Scotland, and was buried in the
church-yard of the Grey-friars at Edinburgh in 1711, aged 52. He
painted most of the Scotch nobility, but was not rich, having twenty
children. The portraits of the professors in the surgeon's-hall at
Edinburgh were painted by him and are commended. At Went∣worth-castle
is a large piece containing the first duke of Argyle and
his sons, the two late dukes, John and Archibald, in Roman habits;
the style Italian, and superior to most modern performers. In Sur∣geon's-hall
are two small histories by him. The duke of Gordon
presented sir John Medina's head to the great duke for his collection
of portraits by the painters themselves; the duke of Gordon too was
drawn by him with his son the marquis of Huntley and his daughter
lady Jane in one piece. Medina was capable both of history and
landscape. He was knighted by the duke of Queensberry, lord high
commissioner, and was the last knight made in Scotland before the
Union. The prints in the octavo edition of Milton were designed
by him, and he composed another set for Ovid's Metamorphosis, but
they were never engraved.</P>
<P>MARCELLUS LAROON</P>
<P>Was born at the Hague in 1653, and learned to paint of his father,
with whom he came young into England. Here he was placed with
<PB N="138" REF="169" MS="y"/>
one La Zoon, a portrait-painter, and then with Fleshiere, but owed
his chief improvement to his own application. He lived several
years in Yorkshire; and when he came to London again, painted
draperies for sir Godfrey Kneller, in which branch he was eminent;
but his greatest excellence was in imitating other masters, and those
considerable. My father had a picture by him that easily passed for
Bassan's. He painted history, portraits, conversations, both in large
and small. Several prints were made from his works, and several
plates he etched and scraped himself. A book of fencing, the cries of
London, and the procession at the coronation of William and Mary
were designed by him. He died of a consumption March 11th, 1702.
His son, captain Laroon, who had a genius both for painting and
music, had his father's picture painted by himself <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The son sold his collection of pictures (among which were many painted by his father) by auction Feb. 24, 1725.</NOTE>.</P>

of those in his work. The substance of it is, that though born to an
estate, he could not resist his impulse to drawing, which made him
ramble over great part of Europe to study painting, which he scarcely
ever practiced, drawing only in black and white, and carried him to
Grand Cairo, where, as he could see no pictures, I am surprized he
did not take to painting. Most of his performances were produced
over a bottle, and took root where they were born: the Mitre
Tavern at Stock's market, and the Bell at Westminster were adorned
by this jovial artist. At the former was a room called <HI>the Amsterdam,</HI>
from the variety of sects Mr. Le Piper had painted in it, particularly
a Jesuit and a Quaker. One branch of his genius, that does not seem
quite so good humoured as the rest of his character, was a talent for
caricaturas. He drew landscapes, etched on silver plates for the to∣bacco-boxes
of his friends, and understood perspective. Towards
the end of his life, his circumstances were reduced enough to make
him glad of turning his abilities to some account.—Becket paid him
for designing his mezzotintos. Several heads of grand signiors in sir
Paul Rycaut's history were drawn by him, and engraved by Elder.
At last, Le Piper took to modelling in wax, and thought he could
have made a figure in it, if he had begun sooner. On the death of
his mother, his fortune being re-established, he launched again into a
course of pleasure, contracted a fever, and being bled by an ignorant
surgeon who pricked an artery, he died of it in 1698, in Alderman∣bury,
and was buried in the church of St. Mary Magdalen Bermond∣sey
in Southwark. Vertue had a large picture by Fuller, containing
the portraits of several painters and of one woman; the person in the
middle was Le Piper.

continuing his art. A print of John Bunyan after Sadler has been
lately published in mezzotinto. His son Mr. Thomas Sadler was de∣puty
clerk of the Pells, and drew too. His fine collection of agates,

nothing but copies of verses on a rainbow? He was born at Dort in
1643; his father who was a school-master, wished to bring him up
to the same profession, but finding the boy's disposition to painting,
he placed him with Solomon Van Hoogstraten, and afterwards with
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">There is a print of Gerard Dou, with this inscription, G. Dou. Pictor Lugd. Batav. honoris ergo, praeceptorem suum delineavit G. Schalken.</NOTE> Gerard Dou, from whom he caught a great delicacy in finishing—

he did portraits, and came with that view to England, but found the
business too much engrossed by Kneller, Closterman and others. Yet
he once drew king William, but as the piece was to be by candle∣light,
he gave his majesty the candle to hold, till the tallow ran down
upon his fingers. As if to justify this ill-breeding, he drew his own
picture in the same situation. Delicacy was no part of his character—
having drawn a lady who was marked with the small-pox but had
handsome hands, she asked him, when the face was finished, if she
must not sit for her hands.—"No, replied Schalken, I always draw
them from my house-maid." Robert earl of Sunderland employed
him at Althorp; at Windsor is a well-known picture in the gallery.
He came over twice, the last time with his wife and family, and staid
long, and got much money. He returned to Holland, and was made
painter to the king of Prussia with a pension, which he enjoyed two or
three years, and died at Dort in 1706. Smith made mezzotintos from
his Magdalen praying by a lamp, and from another picture of a
woman sleeping.</P>

Adrian came to England, at the age of seventeen, and fol∣lowed

except by Granville earl of Bath, for whom he worked at his
seat, and drew several views and ruins in the west of England. One
cannot think him a despicable painter, for seven of his landscapes were
in Sir Peter Lely's collection. His own portrait with a kind of ragged
stuff about his head, and a landscape in his hand, was painted by him∣self.

his horses <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The fine horse under the duke of Schomberg by Kneller, was painted by Wyck.</NOTE> particularly, have a spirit and neatness scarce inferior to
Woverman's; the colouring of his landscapes is warm, and chear∣ful.
Sometimes he painted large pieces, as of the battle of the Boyne,
the siege of Namur <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Lord Ilchester has the siege of Narden by him, with king William, when prince of Orange, commanding at it; and lord Finlater the siege of Namur with the same king and his attendants, extremely like.

his merit. At Houghton is a grey-hound's head by him, of admi∣rable
nature; in king James's collection was a battle by him. He
painted several views in Scotland, and of the isle of Jersey, and drew
a book of hunting and hawking. John Wyck married in England,
and died at Mortlack in 1702. Besides that eminent disciple Mr.
Wootton, he had another scholar</P>
<P>Sir MARTIN BECKMAN,</P>
<P>Who drew several views, and pieces of shipping. He was engineer
to Charles II, and planned Tilbury-fort and the works at Sheerness <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Description of London and the Environs, vol. vi. p. 143.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY VAN STRAATEN</P>
<P>A Landscape-painter, resided in London about the year 1690
and afterwards. He got much money here, but squandered it as fast.
One day sitting down to paint, he could do nothing to please him∣self.
He made a new attempt, with no better success. Throwing
down his pencils, he stretched himself out to sleep, when thrusting
his hand inadvertently into his pocket, he found a shilling; swearing
an oath, he said, it is always thus when I have any money. Get thee
gone, continued he, throwing the shilling out of the window, and re∣turning
to his work, produced one of his best pieces. This story he
related to the gentleman who bought the picture. His drawings are
in the style of Ruisdale and Berghem.

</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="179"/>J. WOOLASTON</P>
<P>Born in London about 1672, was a portrait-painter, and happy in
taking likenesses, but I suppose never excellent, as his price was but
five guineas for a ¾ cloth. He married the daughter of one Green,
an attorney, by whom he had several children, of which one son fol∣lowed
his father's profession. In 1704 the father resided in Warwick∣lane,
and afterwards near Covent-garden. He died an aged man in
the Charter-house. Besides painting, he performed on the violin and
flute, and played at the concert held at the house of that extraordinary
person, Thomas Britton, the smallcoal-man, whose picture he twice
drew, one of which portraits was purchased by Sir Hans Sloane, and
is now in the British Museum. There is a mezzotinto from it. T.
Britton, who made much noise in his time, considering his low station
and trade, was a collector of all sorts of curiosities, particularly draw∣ings,
prints, books, manuscripts on uncommon subjects, as mystic
divinity, the philosopher's stone, judicial astrology, and magic; and
musical instruments, both in and out of vogue. Various were the
opinions concerning him: Some thought his musical assembly only a
cover for seditious meetings; others for magical purposes. He was
taken for an Atheist, a Presbyterian, a Jesuit. But Woolaston the
painter and the father of a gentleman from whom I received this ac∣count,
and who were both members of the music-club, assured him
that Britton was a plain, simple, honest man, who only meaned to a∣muse
himself. The subscription was but ten shillings a year: Britton
found the instruments, and they had coffee at a penny a dish. Sir
Hans Sloane bought many of his books, and MSS. (now in the Mu∣seum)
<PB N="146" REF="180" MS="y"/>
when they were sold by auction at Tom's coffee-house near
Ludgate.</P>
<P>JOHN SCHNELL,</P>
<P>Of whom, or of his works, says Vertue, I never heard, except from
his epitaph in St. James's-church-yard at Bristol. H. S. E. John
Schnell, portrait-painter, born at Basil April 28, 1672, died Nov. 24,
1714. One Linton was a painter of several citizens in this reign,
from whose works there are prints. These trifling notices, as I have
said, are only inserted, to lead to farther discoveries, or to assist fami∣lies
in finding out the painters of their ancestors. The rest of this
reign must be closed with a few names, not much more important.</P>
<P>Sir RALPH COLE</P>
<P>Appears as the painter of a picture of Thomas Windham, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> from
which there is a mezzotinto.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> HEFELE</P>
<P>A German, came over as a soldier in king William's Dutch troops,
obtained his discharge, and remained here several years, dying, it is
said, in queen Anne's reign. He painted landscapes, flowers and in∣sects
neatly in water-colours, but with too little knowledge of chiaro
scuro. He sold a few of his works to collectors, and the rest, being
very poor, to printsellers. They are now very scarce. Mr. Willett,
a merchant and virtuoso in Thames-street, has about thirty, and Mr.
Chadd, jeweller in Bond-street, about a dozen.

</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="181"/>The BISHOP of ELY,</P>
<P>Vertue says he had seen two drawings in black-lead by the bishop of
Ely, the one of arch-bishop Dolben from Loggan, the other of arch∣bishop
Tenison from White, but he does not specify the name of the
bishop. If these portraits were done at the time of Tenison being pri∣mate,
it was probably Simon Patrick bishop of Ely, who, says his
epitaph, was illustrious, Optimis artibus colendis promovendisque.
But if it was the bishop, living when Vertue's MS. is dated, which is,
1725, it was Dr. Thomas Green. Graham mentions another prelate,</P>
<P>SIMON DIGBY</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Consecrated Jan. 12, 1691.</NOTE> Bishop of Elfin in Ireland, whose limnings he much commends. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">There are some of his lordship's miniatures at Shirburn-castle, particularly a head of Kildare lord Digby, great-grandfather of the present lord. The bishop's father was bishop of Dromore, and a branch of the same family with lord Digby, but settled in Ireland. I am told that a taste for the art continues in the bishop of Elsin's descendents, one of whom has a genius for landscape.</NOTE></P>
<P>SUSAN PENELOPE ROSE,</P>
<P>Daughter of Gibson the dwarf and wife of a jeweller, painted in water∣colours
with great freedom. In Mr. Rose's sale 1723, was a half∣length
miniature of an embassador from Morocco, eight inches by six,
painted by her in 1682, with the embassador's names on it; he sat to
her and to Sir Godfrey Kneller at the same time. I have the portrait
<PB N="148" REF="182" MS="y"/>
of bishop Burnet in his robes as chancellor of the garter, by her.
She died in 1700, at the age of 48, and was buried in Covent-garden.</P>
<P>MARY MORE,</P>
<P>A lady, who, I believe, painted for her amusement, was grand∣mother
of Mr. Pitfield; in the family are her and her husband's por∣traits
by herself. In the Bodleian Library at Oxford is a picture that
she gave to it, which by a strange mistake is called Sir Thomas More,
though it is evidently a copy of Cromwell earl of Essex. Nay, Ro∣bert
Whitehall, a poetaster, wrote verses to her in 1674, on her send∣ing
this supposed picture of Sir Thomas More. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">V. Wood's Athenae, vol. ii. fol. 786.</NOTE></P>
<P>The other arts made no figure in this reign; I scarce find even
names of Professors.</P>
<P>JOHN BUSHNELL,</P>
<P>An admired statuary in his own time, but only memorable to us by a
capricious character. He was scholar of Burman, who having de∣bauched
his servant-maid, obliged Bushnell to marry her. The lat∣ter
in disgust left England, staid two years in France, and from
thence went to Italy. He lived some time at Rome and at Venice;
in the last city he made a magnificent monument for a Procuratore di
San Marco, representing the seige of Candia, and a naval engage∣ment
between the Venetians and Turks. He came home through
Germany by the way of Hamburgh. Some of his first works after
his return were the Statues of Charles I, and II, at the Royal-ex∣change,
<PB N="149" REF="183"/>
and Sir Thomas Gresham there above stairs. His best were
the kings at Temple-bar. He carved several marble monuments,
particularly one for lord Ashburnham in Sussex; one for Dr. Grew's
wife in Christ-church London, one for lord Thomond in Northamp∣tonshire;
Cowley's and Sir Palmes Fairborn's in Westminster-abbey,
and cut a head of Mr. Talman. He had agreed to compleat the set
of kings at the Royal-exchange, but hearing that another person (I
suppose, Cibber) had made interest to carve some of them, Bushnell
would not proceed, though he had begun six or seven. Some of his
profession asserting that, though he was skillfull in drapery, he could
not execute a naked figure, he engaged in an Alexander the Great,
which served to prove that his rivals were in the right, at least in what
he could <HI>not</HI> do. His next whim was to demonstrate the possibility of
the Trojan horse, which he had heard treated as a fable that could not
have been put in execution. He undertook such a wooden receptacle,
and had the dimensions made in timber, intending to cover it with
stucco. The head was capable of containing twelve men sitting
round a table; the eyes served for windows. Before it was half com∣pleated,
a storm of wind overset and demolished it, and though two
Vintners, who had contracted with him to use his horse as a drinking
booth, offered to be at the expence of erecting it again, he was too
much disappointed to recommence. This project cost him 500<HI>l.</HI>
Another, of vessels for bringing coals to London, miscarried too, with
deeper cost. These schemes, with the loss of an estate that he had
bought in Kent, by a law-suit, quite overset his disordered brain.
He died in 1701, and was buried at Paddington, leaving two sons
and a daughter. The sons, of whom one had 100<HI>l.</HI> a year, the other
60<HI>l.</HI> were as great humourists as the Father; they lived in a large
<PB N="150" REF="184" MS="y"/>
house fronting Hyde-park, in the lane leading from Piccadilly to
Tyburn, which had been built by the father, but was unfinished, and
had neither stair-case nor floors. Here they dwelt like hermits, re∣cluse
from all mankind, sordid and impracticable, and saying the
world had not been worthy of their father. Vertue in one of his MSS.
dated 1725, begins thus; After long expectations I saw the inside of
John Bushnell's house, the sons being abroad both." He describes it
particularly, and what fragments he saw there, particularly a model
in plaister of Charles II. on horseback, designed to have been cast in
brass, but almost in ruins: the Alexander and the unfinished kings.
Against the wall a large piece of his painting, a triumph, almost
obliterated too. He was desired to take particular notice of a bar of
iron, thicker than a man's wrist, broken by an invention of Bushnell.</P>
<P>THOMAS STANTON,</P>
<P>A statuary, made a tomb in the church of Stratford upon Avon,
which Vertue says is in a good taste.</P>
<P>D. LE MARCHAND</P>
<P>Was a carver in ivory born at Dieppe; was many years in England,
and cut a great number of heads in bas-relief, and some whole
figures in ivory: Mr. West has his head carved by himself, oval.
Lord Oxford had the bust of lord Somers by him. He also did one
of Sir Isaac Newton, another was a profile of Charles Marbury, set in
a frame of looking-glass. Mr. Willet has another head of a gentle∣man,
pretty large, with the initial letters, D. L. M. He died in 1726.

</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="185" MS="y"/>WILLIAM TALMAN,</P>
<P>Born at West-Lavington in Wiltshire, where he had an estate, was
comptroller of the works in the reign of king William, but of his life
I find scarce any particulars, though he was an architect employed in
considerable works. In 1671 he built Thoresby-house in Notting∣hamshire,
burned a few years ago, Dynham-house in Gloucestershire
1698, and Chatsworth; the elegance and lightness of the latter front
do great honour to the artist; the other sides are not equally beautiful.
The flight of steps by which you ascend from the hall to the apart∣ments
was thought noble enough by Kent to be borrowed for Holkam.
His son John Talman resided much in Italy, and made a large col∣lection
of prints and drawings, particularly of churches and altars,
many of which were done by himself. Mr. Sadler had many altars
and insides of churches at Rome, washed by him in their proper co∣lours,
and very well executed. In the same manner he drew several
of lord Oxford's curiosities. A few of his drawings are in the library
of the Antiquarian Society.</P>
<P>Sir WILLIAM WILSON</P>
<P>Was an architect, and re-built the steeple of Warwick-church, after
it had been burned.</P>

<P>THE reign of Anne so illustrated by heroes, poets and
authors, was not equally fortunate in artists. Except Kneller,
scarce a painter of note. Westminster-abbey testifies there
were no eminent statuaries. One man there was, who disgraced this
period by his architecture, as much as he enlivened it by his wit.
Formed to please both Augustus, and an Egyptian monarch who
thought nothing preserved fame like a solid mass of stone, he
produced the Relapse and Blenheim! Party, that sharpened the genius
of the age, dishonoured it too—a half-penny print of Sacheverel
would have been preferred to a sketch of Raphael. Lord Sunderland
and lord Oxford collected books; the duke of Devonshire and lord
Pembroke, pictures, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prince George of Denmark, the queen's husband, had a collection of medals, which her majesty took in her share of his personal estate, the whole of which amounted to 37000 <HI>l.</HI> The queen had half; the rest was divided among his nephews and neices, who were so many, that they did not receive above 1500 <HI>l.</HI> each.

<P><GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> PELEGRINI</P>
<P>Was brought from Venice in this reign by the duke of Manchester,
for whom he painted a staircase in Arlington-street, now destroyed.
He performed several works of this kind, for the duke of Portland
and lord Burlington, a salon, staircase, and cielings at Castle Howard,
the staircase at Kimbolton, and a hall at Sir Andrew Fountain's at
Narford in Norfolk. He made several designs for painting the dome
of St. Paul's, and was paid for them, though they were not executed,
and was chosen one of the directors of the academy. He painted be∣sides
many small pieces of history, before he left England <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When the famous system of Mr. Lawes was set on foot in France, the direc∣tors, as ostentatious as their apes, the Southsea-company, purchased the Hotel de Nevers, and began to decorate it in the most pompous manner. Pelegrini was in∣vited from England to paint the cieling of the principal gallery, and wrote a de∣scription of his work—all that now remains of it; for the system burst, and the king purchasing the visionary palace, it was converted into the Royal Library and Pelegrini's labours demolished. France, the heathen gods, the river of Mississipi, religion, and all the virtues, and half the vices, as allegoric personages, with which the flatterers of the former reign had fatigued the eyes of the public, were here again re-assembled; and avarice and prodigality and imposture were perfumed out of the same censers with which ambition, and vain-glory, and superstition had been made drunk before. Pelegrini's account of that work may be seen in L'Histoire des Premiers Peintres du Roi. Vol. ii. p. 122.</NOTE>, whither
he returned in 1718, but quitted it again in 1721, and entered into
the service of the elector palatine. With him arrived

</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="188"/>MARCO RICCI, or RIZZI,</P>
<P>Who painted ruins in oil, and better in water-colours; and land∣storms.
He and Pelegrini disagreeing, Marco went to Venice and
persuaded his uncle to come over, Sebastian Ricci, who had been
Pelegrini's master, and who was soon preferred to the disciple.
Ricci's works are still admired, though there is little excellence in
them; his colouring is chalky and without force. He painted the
chapel at Bulstrode for the duke of Portland, and in the last supper
has introduced his own portrait in a modern habit. At Burlington-house
the hall and some cielings are by him, and a piece of ruins in
the manner of Viviano. Ricci and Cassini, another painter here at
that time <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sebastian Ricci excelled particularly in imitations of Paul Veronese, many of which he sold for originals; and once even deceived La Fosse. When the latter was convinced of the imposition, he gave this severe but just reprimand to Sebastian; "For the future, said he, take my advice, paint nothing but Paul Veroneses, and no more Riccis." V. Life of Mignard in L'Histoire des Premi∣eres Peintres du Roi. P. 152.</NOTE>, passed off several of their own compositions, as the works
of greater masters. Sebastian painted the altar-piece in the chapel of
Chelsea-college; but left England on finding it was determined that

<P>Was born of a genteel family in Hungary; his father, a deputy from
the states of that country to the emperor. The son was not brought
up to the profession, but made considerable progress by the force of
his natural abilities. Fruit, flowers, and especially birds were his ex∣cellence.
Queen Anne bespoke several of his pieces, still in the royal
palaces. He was a man of a gentle and fair character, and lived
between forty and fifty years in England, known at first only by the
name of the Hungarian. He had raised an easy fortune, but being
persuaded to make it over to his son, who was going to marry a re∣puted
fortune, who proved no fortune at all, and other misfortunes
succeeding, poverty and sickness terminated his life at his house in
Great Queen-street. His pictures and goods were sold by auction at
his house, the sign of the golden eagle, in Great Queen-street, Lin∣coln's-inn-fields.
His son is in the board of Ordnance, and formerly
painted in his father's manner.</P>
<P>WILLIAM CLARET</P>
<P>Imitated Sir Peter Lely, from whom he made many copies. There is
a print from his picture of John Egerton earl of Bridgwater, done as
early as 1680. Claret died at his house in Lincoln's-inn-fields in
1706, and being a widower, made his house-keeper his heiress.</P>
<P>THOMAS MURRAY</P>
<P>Painted many portraits. At the Royal-society is a picture of Dr.
Halley by him, and the earl of Halifax had one of Wycherley.
There is a mezzotinto of Murray.

</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="194"/>HUGH HOWARD,</P>
<P>Better known by Prior's beautiful verses to him, than by his own
works, was son of Ralph Howard doctor of physic, and was born in
Dublin Feb. 7, 1675. His father being driven from Ireland by the
troubles that followed the Revolution, brought the lad to England,
who discovering a disposition to the arts and Belles Lettres, was sent
to travel in 1697, and on his way to Italy, passed through Holland
in the train of Thomas earl of Pembroke, one of the plenipotentiaries
at the treaty of Ryswick. Mr. Howard proceeded as he had intended,
and having visited France and Italy, returned home in October 1700.</P>
<P>Some years he passed in Dublin, but the greatest and latter part of
his life he spent entirely in England, practicing painting, at least with
applause; but having ingratiated himself by his fame and knowledge
of hands with men of the first rank, particularly the duke of Devon∣shire
and lord Pembroke, and by a parsimonious management of his
good fortune and of what he received with his wife, he was enabled to
quit the practical part of his profession for the last twenty years of his
life, the former peer having obtained for him the posts of keeper of
the state-papers and pay-master of his majesty's palaces. In this plea∣sing
situation he amused himself with forming a large collection of
prints, books and medals, which at his <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He died in Pall-mall, and was buried at Richmond.</NOTE> death (March 17, 1737)
he bequeathed to his only brother Robert Howard bishop of Elphin,
who transported them to Ireland.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard's picture was drawn by Dahl, very like, and published
in mezzotinto about a year before his death. Howard himself etched,
from a drawing of Carlo Maratti, a head of Padre Resta, the collector,
with his spectacles on, turning over a book of drawings.

</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="195"/>JAMES PARMENTIER,</P>
<P>A Frenchman born in 1658, was nephew of Bourdon by whom he
was first instructed, but his uncle dying, he came to England in 1676,
and was employed at Montagu-house by La Fosse to lay his dead co∣lours.
King William sent Parmentier to his new palace at Loo, but
he quarrelled with Marot, the surveyor of the buildings, and returned
to London, where not finding much employment, he went into York∣shire,
and worked several years, both in portrait and historic paint∣ing.
The altar-piece in a church at Hull, and another in St. Peter's
at Leeds, Moses receiving the law, much commended by Thoresby,
are of his hand. His best work was the staircase at Worksop. To
Painter's- hall he gave the story of Diana and Endymion. On the
death of Laguerre in 1721, he returned to London, in hopes of suc∣ceeding
to the business of the latter. He died in indifferent circum∣stances
Dec. 2, 1730, as he was on the point of going to Amsterdam,
whither he had been invited by some relations. He was buried in St.
Paul's Covent-garden.</P>
<P>JOHN VANDER VAART</P>
<P>Of Harlem, came to England in 1674, and learned of Wyck the
father, but did not confine himself to landscape. For some time he
painted draperies for Wissing, and portraits <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He twice drew his own portrait, at the age of 30, and of 60; and one of Kerseboom.</NOTE> for himself, and still∣life.
He was particularly famous for representations of partridges
and dead game. In old Devonshire-house in Piccadilly he painted a
<PB N="158" REF="196" MS="y"/>
violin against a door, that deceived every body. When the house was
burned, this piece was preserved and is now at Chatsworth. In 1713
he sold his collection, and got more money by mending pictures than
he did in the former part of his life by painting them. He built a
house in Covent-garden of which parish he was an inhabitant above
fifty years. He was a man of an amiable character, and dying of a
fever in 1721 at the age of seventy-four, was buried in the right∣hand
isle of the church of Covent-garden. Prints were taken from
several of his works; some he executed in mezzotinto himself, and
others from Wissing; in which art he gave instructions to the cele∣brated
John Smith. Vander Vaart, who was a batchelor, left a
nephew, Arnold, who succeeded him in the business of repairing
pictures.</P>
<P>RHODOLPHUS SHMUTZ</P>
<P>Was born at Basil in Swisserland, and in 1702 came into England,
where he painted portraits: Vertue says, "They were well-coloured,
his draperies pleasant, and his women gracefull. He died in 1714,
and was buried at Pancras.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> PREUDHOMME,</P>
<P>Born at Berlin of French parents, and educated in the academy there,
went for some time to Italy, returned to Berlin and from thence came
to England in 1712, where he was much employed in copying pic∣tures,
and making drawings in chalk from Italian masters for engra∣vers.
There was a design of engraving a set of prints from all the
<PB N="159" REF="197" MS="y"/>
best pictures in this country, and Preudhomme went to Wilton with
that view, where, after an irregular life, he died in 1726 at the age
of forty. He had contracted a French style in his pictures from his
master Monsieur Pesne.</P>
<P>Colonel SEYMOUR,</P>
<P>Nearly related to the present duke of Somerset and the earl of Hert∣ford,
had some fine pictures, and painted in water-colours and cray∣ons.
In the latter he copied from Cooper a head of Sir John Robin∣son
lieutenant of the Tower. He also drew many historic heads, and
portraits with a pen. He lived in the house in Hyde-park at the end
of Kensington-garden.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> BOIT,</P>
<P>Well-known for his portraits in enamel, in which manner he has
never perhaps been surpassed but by his predecessor Petitot, and his
successor Zincke. Before I give an account of him, I must premise
that I do not answer for the truth of some parts of his story, which
to me seem a little incredible. I give them as I find them in two dif∣ferent
MSS. of Vertue, who names his authors, Peterson, a scholar
of Boit and another person. Vertue was incapable of falshood—per∣haps
he was too credulous.</P>
<P>Boit, whose father was a Frenchman, was born at Stockholm, and
bred a jeweller, which profession he intended to follow here in Eng∣land,
but changed for painting, but was upon so low a foot, that he
went into the country, and taught children to draw. There he had
engaged one of his scholars, a gentleman's daughter to marry him,
<PB N="160" REF="198"/>
but the affair being discovered, Boit was thrown <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An act of tyranny, as the affair was not compleat, nor was there then a marriage-act.</NOTE> into prison. In
that confinement, which lasted two years, he studied enamelling; an
art to which he fixed on his return to London, and practiced with the
greatest success: Dahl chiefly recommended him. His prices are not
to be believed. For a copy of colonel Seymour's picture by Kneller,
he had thirty guineas; for a lady's head not larger, double that sum,
and for a few plates 500 <HI>l.</HI> If this appears enormous, what will the
reader think of the following anecdote? He was to paint a large plate
of the queen, prince George, the principal officers and ladies of the
court, and Victory introducing the duke of Marlborough and prince
Eugene; France and Bavaria prostrate on the ground; standards,
arms, trophies. The size of the plate to be from 24 to 22 inches
high, by 16 to 18 inches wide. Laguerre actually painted the design
for it in oil. Prince George, who earnestly patronized the work, pro∣cured
an advance of 1000 <HI>l.</HI> to Boit, who took a spot of ground in
May-fair, and erected a furnace, and built convenient rooms adjoyn∣ing
to work in. He made several essays before he could even lay the
enamelled ground, the heat necessary being so intense that it must cal∣cine
as much in a few hours, as furnaces in glass-houses do in 24 hours.
In these attempts he wasted seven or eight hundred pounds. In the mean
time the prince, who had often visited the operation, died. This put
a stop to the work for some time; Boit however began to lay colours
on the plate; but demanded and obtained 700 <HI>l.</HI> more. This made
considerable noise, during which happened the revolution at court,
extending itself even to Boit's work. Their graces of Marlborough
were to be displaced even in the enamel, and her majesty ordered Boit,
<PB N="161" REF="199"/>
to introduce Peace and Ormond, instead of Victory and Churchill.
These alterations were made in the sketch, which had not been in the
fire, and remained so in Peterson's hands, when he related the story to
Vertue. Prince Eugene refused to sit. The queen died. Boit ran
in debt, his goods were seized by execution, and he fled to France;
where he changed his religion, was countenanced by the regent, ob∣tained
a pension of 250 <HI>l.</HI> per ann. and an apartment, and was much
admired in a country where they had seen no enameller since Petitot.
Boit died suddenly at Paris, about Christmas 1726. Though he never
executed the large piece in question, there is one at Kensington of a
considerable size, representing queen Anne sitting, and prince George
standing by her. At Bedford-house is another very large plate of the
duke's father and mother. I have a good copy by him of the Venus,
Cupid, Satyr and Nymphs, by Luca Jordano at Devonshire-house,
and a fine head of admiral Churchill; and miss Reade, the paintress,
has a very fine head of Boit's own daughter, enamelled by him from
a picture of Dahl. This daughter was married to Mr. Graham,
apothecary, in Poland-street.</P>
<P>LEWIS CROSSE,</P>
<P>A painter in water-colours, who is not to be confounded with <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is Michael Crosse, of whom there is an account in Graham.</NOTE> Mi∣chael
Crosse or De La Crux, whom I have mentioned in the reign of
Charles I. Lewis Crosse painted several portraits in miniature in
queen Anne's time, many of which are in the collection of the duchess
of Portland, the countess of Cardigan, &amp;c. This Crosse repaired a
little picture of the queen of Scots in the possession of duke Hamilton,
<PB N="162" REF="200" MS="y"/>
and was ordered to make it as handsome as he could. It seems, a
round face was his idea of perfect beauty, but it happened not to be
Mary's sort of beauty. However, it was believed a genuine picture,
and innumerable copies were made from it. It is the head in black
velvet trimmed with ermine. Crosse had a valuable collection of mi∣niatures,
the works of Peter Oliver, Hoskins and Cooper. Among
them was a fine picture of a lady Sunderland by the latter, his own
wife, and a head almost profile in crayons of Hoskins; a great curio∣sity,
as I neither know of any other portrait of that master, nor where
the picture itself is now. That collection was sold at his house the
sign of the blue anchor in Henrietta-street Covent-garden Dec. 5,
1722, and Crosse died in October 1724.</P>
<P>Statuary in this reign, and for some years afterwards, was in a
manner monopolized by</P>
<P>FRANCIS BIRD.</P>
<P>The many public works by his hand, which inspire nobody with a
curiosity of knowing the artist, are not good testimonies in his favour.
He was born in Piccadilly 1667, and sent at eleven years of age to
Brussels, where he learned the rudiments of his art from one Cozins,
who had been in England. From Flanders he went to Rome, and
studied under Le Gros. At nineteen, scarce remembring his own
language, he came home, and worked first for Gibbons, then for Cib∣ber.
He took <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These two journies, it is said, he performed on foot.</NOTE> another short journey to Italy, and at his return set up
for himself. The performance that raised his reputation, was the
<PB N="163" REF="201"/>
monument of Busby. The latter had never permitted his picture to
be drawn. The moment he was dead, his friends had a cast in plais∣ter
taken from his face, and thence a drawing in crayons, from which
White engraved his print, and Bird carved his image. His other
principal works, which are all I find of his history, were,</P>
<P>The conversion of St. Paul in the pediment of that cathedral. Any
statuary was good enough for an ornament of that height, and a great
statuary had been too good.</P>
<P>The bas-reliefs under the portico.</P>
<P>The statue of queen Anne, and the four figures round the pedestal,
before the same church. The author of the Abregè, speaking of
English artists, says, "à l'egard de la sculpture, le marbre gemit pour
ainsi dire, sous des ciseaux aussi peu habiles que ceux qui ont executé
le groupe de la reine Anne, placè devant l'Eglise de St. Paul, &amp; les
tombeaux de l'Abbaye de Westminster." This author had not seen
the works of Rysbrach and Roubiliac; and for the satire on the groupe
of queen Anne, we may pardon the sculptor who occasioned it, as it
gave rise to another satire, those admirable lines of Dr. Garth.</P>
<P>The statue of cardinal Wolsey at Christ-church.</P>
<P>The brazen figure of Henry VI. at Eton-college—a wretched
performance indeed!</P>
<P>A magnificent monument in Fulham-church for the lord viscount
Mordaunt. Bird received 250<HI>l.</HI> for his part of the sculpture.</P>
<P>The sumptuous monument of the last duke of Newcastle in West∣minster-abbey,
erected by the countess of Oxford, his daughter. The
cumbent figure is not the worst of Bird's works.</P>
<P>At lord Oxford's auction was sold his copy of the faun.
Bird died in 1731, aged 64.

</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="202" MS="y"/>Sir JOHN VANBRUGH</P>
<P>Belongs only to this work in a light that is by no means advantage∣ous
to him. He wants all the merit of his writings, to protect him
from the censure due to his designs. What Pope said of his come∣dies,
is much more applicable to his buildings—<Q>How Van wants grace!—</Q>Grace! He wanted eyes, he wanted all ideas of proportion, conve∣nience,
propriety. He undertook vast designs, and composed heaps
of littleness. The style of no age, no country, appears in his works;
he broke through all rule and compensated for it by no imagination.
He seems to have hollowed quarries rather than to have built houses;
and should his edifices, as they seem formed to do, out-last all record,
what architecture will posterity think was that of their ancestors? The
laughters, his cotemporaries, said, that having been confined in the
bastile, he had drawn his notions of building from that fortified dun∣geon.
That a single man should have been capricious, should have
wanted taste, is not extraordinary. That he should have been selected
to raise a palace <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The duchess quarrelled with Sir John and went to law with him, but though he proved to be in the right, or rather <HI>because</HI> he proved to be in the right, she employed Sir Christopher Wren to build the house in St. James's-park.</NOTE>, built at the public expence, for the hero of his
country, surprises one. Whose thought it was to load every avenue to
that palace with inscriptions, I do not know; altogether, they form
an edition of the acts of parliament in stone. However partial the
court was to Vanbrugh, every body was not so blind to his defects.
Swift ridiculed both his own diminutive house at Whitehall, and the

stupendous pile at Blenheim; of the first he says,<Q><L>At length they in the rubbish spy</L>
<L>A thing resembling a goose pye.</L></Q>And of the other<Q><L>That if his grace were no more skill'd in</L>
<L>The art of battering walls than building,</L>
<L>We might expect to see next year</L>
<L>A mouse-trap-man chief engineer.</L></Q></P>
<P>Thus far the satyrist was well founded; party-rage warped his un∣derstanding,
when he censured Vanbrugh's plays, and left him no
more judgment to see their beauties, than Sir John had, when he
perceived not that they were the only beauties he was formed to com∣pose.
Nor is any thing sillier than Swift's pun on Vanbrugh's being
Clarenceux-herald, which the dean supposes enabled him <HI>to build
houses.</HI> Sir John himself had not a worse reason for being an archi∣tect.
The faults of Blenheim did not escape the severe Dr. Evans,
though he lays them on the master, rather than on the builder;<Q><L>The lofty arch his vast ambition shows,</L>
<L>The stream an emblem of his bounty flows.</L></Q></P>
<P>These invectives perhaps put a stop to Vanbrugh's being employed
on any more buildings for the crown, though he was surveyor of the
works at Greenwich, comptroller general of the works, and surveyor
of the gardens and waters. His other designs were,</P>
<P>St. John's-church, Westminster, a wonderful piece of absurdity.<Q><L>Castle-howard in Yorkshire.</L>
<L>Eastberry in Dorsetshire.</L>
<L>King's-weston near Bristol.</L>
<L>Easton-neston in Northamptonshire.</L>
<L><PB N="166" REF="205"/>
One front of Grimsthorp.</L>
<L>Mr. Duncomb's in Yorkshire.</L>
<L>Two little castles at Greenwich.</L>
<L>The Opera-house in the Hay-market.</L></Q></P>
<P>Durable as these edifices are, the Relapse, the Provoked Wife,
the Confederacy and Aesop, will probably out-last them; nor, so
translated, is it an objection to the two last that they were translations.
If Vanbrugh had borrowed from Vitruvius as happily as from
Dancour, Inigo Jones <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Inigo Jones imitated the taste of the antique, but did not copy it so servilely as Palladio. Lord Burlington, who had exquisite taste, was a little too fearful of deviating from his models. Raphael, Michael Angelo, Vignola, Bernini, and the best Italian architects, have dare to invent, when it was in the spirit of the standard. Perhaps there could not be a more beautiful work, than a volume collected and engraved from the buildings and hints of buildings in the pictures of Raphael, Albano, Pietrò Cortona, and Nicolò Poussin. It is surprizing that Raphael's works in this manner have not been assembled. Besides thoughts in his paintings, he executed several real buildings of the truest delicacy.</NOTE> would not be the first architect of Britain.</P>
<P>Sir John Vanbrugh died at Whitehall March 26, 1726. In his
character of architect, Dr. Evans bestowed on him this epitaph,<Q><L>Lie heavy on him, earth, for he</L>
<L>Laid many a heavy load on thee.</L></Q></P>

<P>JOHN CROKER,</P>

He worked for Harris; and succeeding him, graved all the
medals from the end of king William's reign, of whom he struck

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The following slight notices relating to artists who have
worked for the English but came not to England, or
who are cursorily mentioned to have been here, are
extracted from Descamps.</HEAD>
<P><HI>HUBERT JACOBS,</HI> of Delft, painted portraits of several
English; and it is pretended that to satisfy their natural im∣patience,
he formed a hasty manner that prejudiced his works and
reputation. Vol. ii. p. 36.</P>
<P><HI>John David de Heem,</HI> of Utrecht, a celebrated painter of flowers,
had sold a capital piece to Vander Meer, another painter, for 2000
florins. Vander Meer being plundered by some troops, had no re∣source
but in presenting that curiosity to king William, having in∣serted
the monarch's head in the garland. The king brought it to
England, having bestowed a lucrative employment on the donor.
Vol. ii. p. 39.</P>
<P><HI>Henry Pot,</HI> of Harlem, drew the portraits of the king and queen
of England, and of the principal nobility—at what time is not spe∣cified—probably
they were Charles II, and his mother, &amp;c. during
their exile. Ib. 43.</P>
<P><PB REF="208" MS="y"/>
<HI>John Lievens,</HI> born at Leyden in 1607, was an admired painter of
portraits. The prince of Orange presented to the English embassador
(who gave it to the king) the picture of a student sitting by the fire,
which pleased so much that Lievens came to England on the credit of
it, drew most of the royal family and many of the nobility, though
then but 24, (it was in 1630) and staid here three years. This is all
the account I find of this painter in England, nor do I know any of
his works here; yet the tradition is confirmed by a MS. catalogue of
king Charles's pictures, in which are named, the student; portraits
of the prince and princess; and a salutation of the virgin. Descamps,
vol. ii. p. 117.</P>
<P><HI>Palamedes Stevens,</HI> according to Descamps, is still more our own,
having been born at London in 1607, though he never practiced
here. His father, an eminent sculptor of Delft, was celebrated for
carving vases in porphyry, agate, jasper, and other precious materials,
and was invited to England by James I, where the son was born,
soon after which he was carried by his father to Holland, and died at
the age of 31. Ib. p. 118.</P>
<P><HI>Nicholas de Heltstokade,</HI> of Nimeguen, painted the king of England.
I suppose, Charles II. Ib. p. 112.</P>
<P>The directors of the Dutch East-india-company gave 4000 florins
for a picture of Gerard Dow, representing a woman with an infant
on her lap, playing with a little girl; they presented it to Charles II.
on his restoration; king William carried it back to Loo. Ib. 221.</P>
<P><HI>Giles Schagen,</HI> of Alcmaer, was a great copyist, and painted por∣traits
and sea-pieces. He was born in 1616, and Descamps says, he
was in England. Ib. 253.</P>
<P>King William gave 900 florins for a picture by <HI>Mary Van Ooster∣wyck.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="209" MS="y"/>
<HI>John Henry Roos,</HI> born at Otterburg in the lower Palatinate in 1631,
was a painter of landscape and animals, and, according to Descamps,
came into England; but probably staid here very little time.</P>
<P><HI>William Sckellinks,</HI> according to the foregoing authority, was here
too, but staid as little. He painted in Holland the embarkation of
Charles II, at the restoration, which was reckoned his capital work.</P>
<P><HI>John de Baan,</HI> born at Harlem 1633, became so considerable a
portrait-painter that on his arrival in England, Lely, who if Descamps
were to be credited, was the most jealous of his profession, (which is
a passion more likely to be felt by the worst artists than by the best)
was exceedingly glad that De Baan returned soon to the Hague. He
frequently drew king William and queen Mary, and painted king
James in his passage through Holland. John de Baan died in 1702.</P>
<P>That neat and curious painter <HI>Vander Heyden</HI> was probably in
England, for Descamps (vol. iii. p. 49.) mentions a view of the
Royal-exchange by him.</P>
<P><HI>Francisco Milè</HI> was here, but made no stay.</P>
<P><HI>Robert du Val,</HI> who had been employed by king William at Loo,
was sent over to clean the Cartoons, and place them in Hampton-court.
See his Life in Descamps, vol. iii. p. 172.</P>
<P><HI>John Van Hugtenburch,</HI> of Harlem, was employed by prince Eugene
to paint his battles, and had a share in the designs for the triumphal
tapestry at Blenheim.</P>
<P><HI>Augustine Terwesten,</HI> of the Hague, born in 1649, visited England
in the course of his studies.</P>
<P><HI>John Vander Spriet,</HI> of Delft, painter of portraits, died at London.
He is quite unknown. V. Descamps, vol. iii. p. 261.</P>
<P><HI>Simon Vander Does,</HI> staid here but a very short time.</P>
