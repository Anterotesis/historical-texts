<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Cousin,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOur <HI>Candour</HI> will pardon a bigger <HI>Fault</HI> in me, than any, I hope, I shall be ever willing to <HI>commit</HI> against the Rules and Laws of <HI>Friendship</HI> and <HI>Honour.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis my giving you the <HI>Trouble</HI> of Read∣ing a <HI>long Letter,</HI> that I now beg your <HI>ex∣cuse</HI> for.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3"/>The <HI>Necessity</HI> of sending it to you, meet∣ing with your <HI>Generous Civility,</HI> your <HI>Christian Temper,</HI> and <HI>Endearing Sweet∣ness</HI> of Disposition, will be a full <HI>Dele∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ry</HI> of all the <HI>Guilt</HI> I can be suppos'd to have <HI>contracted</HI> by its length.</P>
<P>My <HI>House</HI> having been lately <HI>broken</HI> at Midnight▪ my being bound <HI>Hand</HI> and <HI>Foot</HI> (and my Servants too) and <HI>robb'd,</HI> has rais'd <HI>variety</HI> of <HI>Reports</HI> in the Country.</P>
<P>Some basely <HI>Reporting,</HI> That I would easily get my <HI>Plate, Money</HI> and <HI>Goods</HI> a∣gain: Meaning, by <HI>Intimations</HI> which they <HI>give</HI> by <HI>Conjuration</HI>; or, by exercising that <HI>Black</HI> and <HI>Accursed Art</HI> of <HI>dealing</HI> with them that have <HI>Familiar Spirits.</HI></P>
<P>And to confirm the <HI>Probability</HI> of their <HI>Supposition,</HI> they do not stick to say, that <HI>That</HI> was the <HI>Reason</HI> why I was so <HI>Cheer∣ful</HI> and <HI>Easie</HI> during the <HI>Robbery</HI>; and <HI>talk'd</HI> so freely with the <HI>Robbers:</HI> And the <HI>Reason</HI> too why I have <HI>been so</HI> ever since.</P>
<P>Nay, some have not sail'd to <HI>endeavour</HI> to put about a <HI>Report,</HI> That my <HI>Money▪ Goods</HI> and <HI>Plate</HI> were brought back to me again.</P>
<P>Others, perhaps <HI>Innocently,</HI> having that Notion of <HI>Learning,</HI> that they thought it might be done by <HI>That.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4"/>All that I have hitherto <HI>said</HI> in my <HI>De∣fence</HI> is <HI>this:</HI> That I would not <HI>do it</HI> to <HI>save</HI> my <HI>Life</HI>; to gain the <HI>Universe</HI>; or Ten Thousand <HI>Worlds.</HI></P>
<P>My dear Cousin, the <HI>Care</HI> that I ought to have of your <HI>Soul,</HI> as my <HI>Parishioner,</HI> as well as my <HI>Relation,</HI> and my <HI>Friend,</HI> makes me willing to speak to you a little more <HI>Affectionately,</HI> and <HI>Tenderly,</HI> and <HI>Closely</HI> upon this Point: And to set you right in it.</P>
<P>Consider with me a little that place, <HI>Levit.</HI> xx.6. <HI>The Soul that turneth after such as have familiar Spirits, and after Wizzards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my Face against that Soul; and will cut him off from among this People.</HI></P>
<P>Now, tho' I can (by Divine Aid) <HI>meek∣ly, sweetly,</HI> and <HI>temperately</HI> bear the <HI>De∣famation</HI> and <HI>Reproach,</HI> as far as <HI>concerns</HI> my <HI>self, (Rejoicing</HI> in the <HI>Mark</HI> and <HI>Cha∣racter</HI> of my <HI>Master, Relying</HI> on his <HI>Cross,</HI> having it in my <HI>view,</HI> to <HI>sweeten</HI> my <HI>Af∣fliction,</HI> to <HI>calm</HI> my <HI>Passions,</HI> to <HI>break</HI> my own <HI>Will,</HI> to <HI>beat</HI> down <HI>Self-love,</HI> and to draw from that Fountain such <HI>Grace</HI> as is necessary to lead a Christian, that is a Crucified Life) yet because the <HI>Honour</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> the <HI>Honour</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> the
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
<HI>Safety</HI> of many <HI>Souls</HI> who may be mis∣led by the suppos'd <HI>Example,</HI> are con∣cern'd; I shall not only demonstrate to you the <HI>Detestation</HI> and <HI>Abhorrence</HI> I have of this <HI>matter,</HI> but endeavour upon this occasion to <HI>rectifie</HI> a great <HI>Mistake</HI> in the World.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ II.</HEAD>
<P>And I shall Plead the <HI>Cause of God</HI>; Labour to <HI>destroy the Works of the De∣vil</HI>; which was the great <HI>Business</HI> of the Holy <HI>Jesus</HI> into the <HI>World,</HI> 1 St. <HI>John</HI> iii.8. To discover this great <HI>Delusion</HI> and <HI>Cheat</HI> of Souls, that endangers often their <HI>Everlasting Interest,</HI> that draws them off from their <HI>Allegiance</HI> to <HI>God,</HI> deserves a <HI>Forfeiture</HI> of his <HI>Favour</HI> and <HI>Protection</HI>▪ and puts them into a <HI>Correspondence</HI> and <HI>Commerce</HI> with the Devil: I mean, the <HI>being,</HI> or <HI>desiring to be</HI> a <HI>Wizzard</HI>; or <HI>the seeking to them that are,</HI> and that in any Case whatever.</P>
<P>Against <HI>this,</HI> the <HI>place</HI> mention'd <HI>(Le¦vit.</HI> xx.6. and many more as you shall presently see) is, one would think, a <HI>dreadful Dissuasive. The Soul that,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>By <HI>Wizzards</HI> are meant those that use any <HI>Conjurations,</HI> or <HI>Witchcrafts,</HI> by <HI>Com¦pact, Correspondence, Commerce, Confede¦racy,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
or <HI>Familiarity with the Devil, or any Evil Spirit of his Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>A thing which those that expect a Hea∣venly <HI>Kingdom,</HI> from their <HI>Father which is in Heaven,</HI> should <HI>tremble</HI> to <HI>think</HI> of, or so much as <HI>once desire</HI> to put in <HI>Pra∣ctice.</HI></P>
<P>We that belong to another <HI>World</HI>▪ We that call <HI>Christ</HI> our Lord; We that pray his <HI>Kingdom may come</HI>; We that <HI>re∣nounc'd</HI> the <HI>Devil</HI> and his <HI>accursed Spirits</HI> in our Baptism; We that have been san∣ctified by the <HI>Holy Spirit of God</HI>; We that have been <HI>seal'd by it to the Day of Redemption,</HI> (Ephes. iv.30.) We whose <HI>Conversation,</HI> or <HI>Citizenship,</HI> or <HI>Freedom</HI> is in Heaven; That We should Act con∣trary (or consent to a <HI>desire</HI> to Act con∣trary) to all <HI>this,</HI> by <HI>applying</HI> our selves to the accursed <HI>Spirits</HI> of <HI>Darkness,</HI> or their <HI>Agents</HI>; this is dismal, this is de∣plorable; and deserves to be lamented with Tears of Blood.</P>
<P>I shall therefore <HI>once for all,</HI> set this in a true <HI>Light</HI> before you, by the <HI>Assistance</HI> of that Holy <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> which is contrary to the <HI>Kingdom</HI> and the <HI>Spirits</HI> of Darkness.</P>
<P>And when you once see the <HI>horrible Impiety</HI> of <HI>being,</HI> or <HI>desiring to be</HI> a <HI>Wiz∣zard,
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
Conjurer</HI> or <HI>Witch</HI>; or, of being engaged in any <HI>Confederacy, League, Fa∣miliarity,</HI> or <HI>Compact</HI> with the <HI>Devil</HI>; and withal, have a <HI>clear</HI> and <HI>tender</HI> View of, and in a close and piercing Thought, con∣sider the <HI>great Wickedness</HI> too of <HI>seeking to them,</HI> whom you suppose to <HI>be such,</HI> in any Case whatever: I know you'll <HI>start back,</HI> and with a <HI>pious Trembling,</HI> not only desire to say with our <HI>Lord, Get thee behind me Satan</HI>; but with St. <HI>Peter</HI> too, presently turn the <HI>stream</HI> of your <HI>Thoughts</HI> and <HI>Passions</HI> another way, and as a <HI>proper Cure</HI> of all such Tendencies, say quickly with him, <HI>Lord, thou knowest that I love thee.</HI></P>

<HEAD>§ III.</HEAD>
<P>That you may do <HI>this</HI> the more <HI>ef∣fectually</HI> and <HI>tenderly,</HI> I must recommend to your <HI>deepest Thoughts</HI> these five or six Things.</P>
<P N="1">1. I shall desire you to consider with a <HI>trembling Spirit,</HI> the <HI>Threatnings</HI> (and consequently the <HI>Hatred</HI>) of the <HI>holy God</HI> against it. I mean, not only of <HI>being,</HI> or <HI>desiring to be</HI> a Wizzard; but of <HI>seeking</HI> and <HI>applying</HI> to them that are suppos'd to <HI>be such.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="9" REF="8"/>2. How severely he has <HI>punish'd</HI> it.</P>
<P N="3">3. Consider, 'tis in some measure to <HI>de∣sert</HI> and <HI>disown</HI> the <HI>Sovereignty</HI> of God; and advance the <HI>Dominion</HI> of the King∣dom of Darkness.</P>
<P N="4">4. 'Tis a <HI>going contrary</HI> to our Bap∣tismal <HI>Vow</HI> and <HI>Covenant.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. 'Tis in a great degree the <HI>casting off</HI> the <HI>Protection,</HI> and <HI>doubting</HI> of the <HI>Care</HI> and <HI>Providence</HI> of the <HI>holy God,</HI> and of a <HI>tender Father</HI>; in hopes to find a <HI>better Friend</HI> in the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. 'Tis to chuse <HI>Iniquity</HI> rather than <HI>Affliction.</HI> These are things that <HI>strike Horrour</HI> in the very <HI>mentioning</HI> of them. And certainly an <HI>Impiety</HI> that has <HI>all</HI> these dismal <HI>Aggravations</HI> and <HI>Dangers</HI> in it, should be <HI>abhorr'd, shunn'd,</HI> and <HI>trem∣bled</HI> at, beyond the standing on the Brink of a <HI>Rock,</HI> or before the Mouth of a <HI>Can∣non</HI> ready to be <HI>discharg'd.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
<HEAD>§ IV.</HEAD>
<P>Consider first the <HI>Threatnings</HI> (and con¦sequently the <HI>Hatred</HI>) of the holy God against it. This appears not only in the place before quoted, <HI>Levit.</HI> xx.6. but in the last Verse of this Chapter, (<HI>Lev.</HI> xx.27) <HI>A man or woman that hath a familiar Spirit, or that is a Wizzard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones: their blood shall be upon them.</HI></P>
<P>Thus <HI>Levit.</HI> xix.31. <HI>Regard not them that have familiar Spirits, neither seek after Wizzards to be defiled by them▪ I am the Lord your God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Neither seek after them:</HI> It seems the very <HI>seeking after them</HI> is to be <HI>defiled</HI> by them.</P>
<P>And shall the Holy and Eternal God look down from the Mansions of Glory▪ and see his <HI>Sovereignty, Protection</HI> and <HI>Care</HI> of you <HI>cast off, slighted</HI> and <HI>dis¦regarded</HI> by you? Or not <HI>Humbly,</HI> and with <HI>Resignation</HI> depended on in the use of <HI>lawful, just</HI> and <HI>prudent</HI> Means?</P>
<P>Shall He, from whom you expect <HI>so much</HI> as you do, see you seeking to Wiz¦zards, and defil'd by them?</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10"/>Shall He see you casting off <HI>his Domi∣nion</HI> and <HI>Providence,</HI> who like a tender <HI>Father</HI> has so long taken <HI>Care</HI> for you? and promised to do it all along; and to bear your Charges home to the end of your <HI>Journey:</HI> Yet because of some Affliction (which he designs for <HI>wise,</HI> and <HI>good,</HI> and <HI>merciful</HI> Ends to you) you'll now con∣sent to the <HI>deserting</HI> him; and turn away and seek to the Accursed <HI>Spirits</HI> of Dark∣ness; and to <HI>Wizzards,</HI> who are Corre∣spondents with them, and consent to be <HI>defil'd</HI> by them.</P>
<P>Wou'd you have this <HI>said</HI> of you, <HI>charg'd</HI> upon you, <HI>remembred</HI> of you at the Resurrection, with a <HI>Depart from me, I know you not?</HI></P>
<P>Yet how justly may he say this to you, who thus <HI>departed</HI> first from him.</P>
<P>Nor should you ever cease tenderly to consider, that the <HI>consulting</HI> Wizzards, and them that have <HI>familiar Spirits,</HI> is call'd an <HI>Abomination to the Lord,</HI> Deut. xviii.11, 12.</P>
<P>And how unlikely is it, that the <HI>Come, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Blessed Children of my Father,</HI> should be said to those who are an <HI>Abomination</HI> to him?</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="section">
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
<HEAD>§ V.</HEAD>
<P>Consider with me next, <HI>How severely he has punish'd this.</HI></P>
<P>It cost <HI>Saul</HI> his Life, though a King, 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> x.13. So <HI>Saul died for his Trans∣gression which he committed against the Lord, and also for asking Counsel of one that had a familiar Spirit to enquire of it; and enquired not of the Lord: Therefore he slew him.</HI></P>
<P>And if he <HI>slew him,</HI> tho' a <HI>King</HI> so <HI>consulting Wizzards,</HI> (them that had <HI>fa∣miliar Spirits,</HI>) I need not stay to ask how justly the <HI>same Actions</HI> may draw down the <HI>same Vengeance.</HI></P>
<P>And if not the <HI>same Vengeance</HI> in this lower World; then, without a <HI>deep</HI> and <HI>tender Repentance,</HI> and an <HI>unfeigned</HI> Re∣turn to God, that <HI>Vengeance</HI> which St. <HI>Jude</HI> speaks of; which is infinitely more to be <HI>fear'd,</HI> than a present <HI>temporal Death</HI>▪ I mean, <HI>the Vengeance of Eternal Life,</HI> Jude 7.</P>
<P>To this Instance I might add the dismal Case of <HI>Manass<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> another King, who so <HI>provok'd the Lord to anger,</HI> by the same Abomination, (2 <HI>Kings</HI> xxi.6.) by <HI>dealing with familiar Spirits</HI> and <HI>Wizzards,</HI> that
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
he drew down <HI>Judgments</HI> on Himself and his Kingdom.</P>
<P><HI>Kings themselves</HI> having been thus <HI>se∣verely punish'd,</HI> for seeking and applying to those who had <HI>familiar Spirits</HI>; the <HI>same Impiety</HI> in you would not only de∣serve the <HI>same,</HI> but <HI>severer</HI> and <HI>worse</HI> Judgments.</P>
<P>For, with a <HI>grateful, soft</HI> and <HI>affectio∣nate</HI> Heart consider, you have had a <HI>clearer Revelation,</HI> and have had <HI>Life and Im∣mortality brought to Light, by the coming of the Holy Jesus,</HI> 2 Tim. i.10.</P>
<P>And shall we, who <HI>more pretend</HI> to be <HI>led by the Spirit of God,</HI> turn away from him, to be led by them that consult with <HI>familiar Spirits,</HI> and the <HI>accursed Spirits</HI> of Darkness?</P>
<P>And to make it a Heap and Conjuga∣tion of many Impieties together, not only cast off the <HI>Divine Protection,</HI> disrespect the <HI>good Providence</HI> of your God, tacitly <HI>blame</HI> his <HI>Conduct,</HI> refuse <HI>Submission</HI> to his <HI>Wisdom,</HI> and his <HI>Will</HI> in <HI>Afflictions</HI>; not only <HI>turning away</HI> from the <HI>Spirit,</HI> to the <HI>Spirits</HI> of <HI>Darkness</HI>; not cheer∣fully <HI>acquiescing</HI> in his <HI>Aids, Directions</HI> and <HI>Consolations</HI>; not only <HI>departing from him,</HI> whom we would not have to say to us, <HI>Depart from me,</HI> in the Day of Judg∣ment:
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
But also (to compleat the Wicked∣ness) all this to proceed from <HI>Pride</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Vain-glory</HI>; or <HI>Malice,</HI> or <HI>Envy; Impa∣tience,</HI> or <HI>Immortification</HI> of Spirit; <HI>Cove∣tousness,</HI> or <HI>Discontent</HI>; and want of <HI>De∣pendence</HI> on, and <HI>Resignation</HI> to God in the use of <HI>just</HI> and <HI>lawful</HI> means.</P>
<P>What a <HI>Heap</HI> and Knot of <HI>Impieties,</HI> are here <HI>bound</HI> up in the Prosecution of <HI>one!</HI> Enough to <HI>sink</HI> a disconsolate Soul to the <HI>Sorrows</HI> of <HI>Eternity.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ VI.</HEAD>
<P>That 'tis in some measure to <HI>desert</HI> and <HI>disown</HI> the <HI>Sovereignty</HI> of God, and ad∣vance the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Darkness,</HI> I have before hinted.</P>
<P>But then if we will thus <HI>cast off</HI> and <HI>de∣spise,</HI> and grow <HI>weary</HI> of the <HI>Providen∣tial Care</HI> and <HI>Protection</HI> of God; weary of our <HI>Dependence</HI> on him and <HI>Resig∣nation</HI> to him; and will run for Help and <HI>Aid, Relief,</HI> and <HI>Cure,</HI> and <HI>Satisfa∣ction,</HI> and <HI>Knowledge,</HI> to the <HI>Devil</HI> and his accursed <HI>Spirits</HI>; if instead of submit¦ting to his <HI>Will,</HI> and to his <HI>Wisdom,</HI> in Afflictions in the <HI>sole</HI> use of <HI>lawful, ratio∣nal, natural</HI> and <HI>prudent</HI> means, we run to th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se: What is this, but to suppose
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
that his <HI>Enemy</HI> and ours will be <HI>kinder</HI> to us than our <HI>God?</HI></P>
<P>Whereas we never enough consider, (never with a Thought <HI>deep,</HI> and <HI>close,</HI> and <HI>piercing</HI> enough) that our God has <HI>kind</HI> and <HI>wise,</HI> and good ends in <HI>Affli∣ctions,</HI> and merciful <HI>Designs</HI>; and the <HI>De∣vil</HI> nothing but <HI>evil</HI> Ends, and <HI>damning</HI> Designs upon us, if he <HI>do</HI> remove them: Nor can he do <HI>that,</HI> without the <HI>Permis∣sion</HI> and <HI>Leave</HI> of our God and Father.</P>
<P>And then what a <HI>Phrenzy</HI> and heighth of <HI>Folly,</HI> as well as <HI>Wickedness</HI> and <HI>Im∣piety</HI> is it, either to <HI>hope,</HI> or but to <HI>con∣sent</HI> to try, whether the <HI>Devil</HI> will be a better <HI>Friend</HI> to us than our <HI>God?</HI></P>
<P>'Tis true, indeed, in Losses, Diseases, and other Afflictions, we may and ought (as I have hinted) to use <HI>rational,</HI> and <HI>prudent, pious</HI> and <HI>diligent, just</HI> and <HI>dis∣creet</HI> Means and Care for our <HI>Satisfaction,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Ease</HI> of them.</P>
<P>And sometimes God <HI>thinks fit</HI> to direct us to the <HI>right,</HI> and sometimes he <HI>does <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: Sometimes</HI> he thinks fit to <HI>bless</HI> the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leans, and sometimes he <HI>does not.</HI></P>
<P>But whether he <HI>does</HI> or <HI>does not</HI> direct <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to, and <HI>bless</HI> and <HI>succeed</HI> the Means <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our <HI>Relief,</HI> or Ease; <HI>Satisfaction,</HI> or <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure; still he has <HI>wise</HI> and <HI>good,</HI> and

<P>But in <HI>recourse,</HI> and going to <HI>Wizzards</HI> and <HI>accursed Spirits</HI>; the <HI>Devil</HI> has none but <HI>ill Ends,</HI> and <HI>horrid Designs,</HI> in the <HI>Relief</HI> and <HI>Successes</HI> that he gives (if he gives any:) And, if possible, for <HI>each Kindness</HI> he does, would have a <HI>Soul</HI> to <HI>Damnation.</HI></P>
<P>So that the very <HI>Afflictions</HI> of our God, are ten thousand times <HI>more choosable,</HI> than any <HI>Relief</HI> we can have of them from <HI>Wizzards,</HI> or those <HI>accursed People,</HI> that <HI>treat</HI> or are in league with the <HI>Spi∣rits</HI> of Darkness.</P>

<P>Nay, more than <HI>that; shall there be Evil in a City, and the Lord hath not done it?</HI> Amos iii.6.</P>
<P>You are to consider, there is the <HI>Evil of Sin,</HI> and the <HI>Evil of Suffering.</HI></P>
<P>The Evil of Sin he is of <HI>purer Eyes</HI> than to <HI>behold:</HI> He abominates it.

<P><PB N="27" REF="26"/>Let us give each of these a <HI>short</HI> and <HI>tender</HI> View: And then, besides the hor∣rid Impiety of <HI>seeking</HI> to the <HI>Devil</HI> or his <HI>Agents</HI> to remove an <HI>Affliction,</HI> so <HI>well,</HI> so <HI>kindly</HI> meant to us by God; we should see Reason to <HI>Adore</HI> and <HI>Thank</HI> him for it: And much rather <HI>Cross</HI> the Impatience of our <HI>Spirit</HI> by a <HI>Thankful Resignation,</HI> than Cross his Merciful <HI>De∣signs</HI> in it; and <HI>That</HI> by the most dread∣ful Wickedness too.</P>

therefore <HI>dispense</HI> as he pleases, who is the <HI>great Master</HI> of the World. And perhaps he would this way try to bring you to say with <HI>humble Love: If This please God, let it be as it is.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. At other times he lets an <HI>Affliction</HI> fall gently on us, <HI>to bring us to Repen∣tance</HI>; and to <HI>Reform</HI> something <HI>he sees</HI> amiss in us, though <HI>we see</HI> it not our selves.</P>
<P>And would we have a <HI>tender Father</HI> let us run on to the Sorrows of Eternity, without <HI>Restraint,</HI> or <HI>Check,</HI> or <HI>Care,</HI> or <HI>Notice?</HI> It may be he sees us about to <HI>turn</HI> out of the <HI>Road</HI> to a <HI>lovely Immor∣tality,</HI> and he would kindly <HI>strike us</HI> in again. This was the Case of <HI>David,</HI> Psal. cxix.67. <HI>Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have kept thy word.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. He sometimes sends it to <HI>hedge in our way to him, tho' with Thorns:</HI> Less than this, or other such-like Methods, would not perhaps serve the <HI>Turn:</HI> And he sees it necessary to chide us into <HI>Resig∣nation,</HI> or some <HI>other Duty.</HI></P>
<P N="5"><PB N="29" REF="28"/>5. Or, it may be, he <HI>lets down</HI> an Af∣fliction upon us, to try whether <HI>we will love him as well when his Hand lies hard upon us, as when it does not.</HI></P>
<P>And when <HI>Job</HI> in this respect was <HI>try'd,</HI> he was found <HI>faithful.</HI> He could as easi∣ly <HI>Bless,</HI> and <HI>Thank,</HI> and <HI>Adore,</HI> and <HI>Love</HI> him when he <HI>took away,</HI> as when he <HI>gave, Job</HI> i.21.</P>
<P>And you your self never <HI>sufficiently consider'd</HI> how unreasonable 'tis to be <HI>troubl'd,</HI> that you have not <HI>one thing</HI> that you <HI>need not,</HI> when your <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Thank∣fulness</HI> to God should be greater for ha∣ving receiv'd <HI>all you need.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Or if he please to send an <HI>Affliction</HI> to <HI>smite here, that he may spare here∣after</HI>; this is the greatest kindness in the World. 'Tis to bring thee to <HI>judge thy self,</HI> that thou may'st not <HI>be judged.</HI> And you'll fly in the <HI>Face</HI> of the <HI>Physician,</HI> be∣cause his <HI>Physick</HI> is unpleasant to the taste.</P>
<P>And if he has a mind to <HI>chuse thee from the Furnace of Affliction,</HI> (Isai. xlviii.10.) do not <HI>chuse</HI> the Sorrows of Eter∣nity by <HI>crossing</HI> his merciful Designs, in going to a Wizzard to seek <HI>thus</HI> to re∣move the kind Affliction.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="30" REF="29"/>7. And then, <HI>seventhly</HI> and <HI>lastly,</HI> If he sometimes sends us an Affliction to <HI>Exercise our Passive Graces; and to try whether we can be content, that his Obe∣dience and his Love should cost us some∣thing.</HI> This puts an opportunity into our Hands, <HI>to Thank</HI> Him, that he has given us any thing that we can lose for him: And above all to consider, that whatever we may lose <HI>for him,</HI> we shall never lose <HI>by him.</HI> And therefore we can never <HI>lose too much for God.</HI></P>

When all the while (as I must again say) your <HI>God</HI> would have <HI>eas'd</HI> it in the use of <HI>Prayer, Diligence,</HI> and <HI>Lawful Means</HI> in a little time: Or, if not, sees it <HI>best for you</HI> not to have it <HI>eas'd</HI> as <HI>yet:</HI> And till <HI>his Time</HI> comes, 'tis not fit you should desire it should be <HI>in your's.</HI></P>
<P>Would you really <HI>accept</HI> of a <HI>Delive∣rance</HI> from the <HI>Devil,</HI> or his Accursed Agents upon these Terms? Ah, no. You know (your Fathers in Christianity, and) the Patriarchs <HI>would not</HI> accept of a <HI>De∣liverance</HI> from the <HI>Afflictions</HI> cast on
<PB N="34" REF="33"/>
them by <HI>Men</HI> or <HI>Devils, that they might obtain a better Resurrection,</HI> Heb. xi.35.</P>
<P>They would not accept of a <HI>Delive∣rance,</HI> though a <HI>lawful</HI> one: And would you <HI>accept</HI> of an <HI>unlawful</HI> and <HI>accursed</HI> one? Would you <HI>accept</HI> of a <HI>Delive∣rance</HI> from the wretched <HI>Spirits</HI> of <HI>Dark∣ness,</HI> who can give you none without <HI>God's Permission?</HI> And who for <HI>this Deliverance</HI> expect and desire no less than your <HI>Soul</HI> down to those Torments from whence there is <HI>no Deliverance.</HI></P>

<P>And now let us <HI>look back</HI> again a lit∣tle to <HI>that place</HI> of <HI>Levit.</HI> xx.6. And let us there observe <HI>one thing</HI> more.</P>
<P>They that <HI>are,</HI> or <HI>desire</HI> to be <HI>Wiz∣zards,</HI> or <HI>seek</HI> to them, <HI>I will even set my Face against that Soul,</HI> says the holy God.</P>
<P>And very justly▪ When you first <HI>set your Face against him: Fly in his Face</HI> for mercifully and kindly correcting you: Fly in his Face for giving you a Thou∣sand <HI>good Things,</HI> and a Thousand <HI>better
<PB N="35" REF="34"/>
Promises</HI>; and gives you but <HI>one Af∣fliction</HI> or <HI>two,</HI> and that too in <HI>Tender∣ness, Love</HI> and <HI>Mercy.</HI></P>
<P>No wonder therefore he has been pleas'd to say, <HI>I will set my Face against that Soul:</HI> You first <HI>setting</HI> yours against Him; <HI>deserting</HI> Him; <HI>running</HI> from Him to his Enemies; <HI>disowning</HI> his <HI>Sovereign∣ty, Protection, Care</HI> and <HI>Providence</HI>; go∣ing contrary to your <HI>Baptismal Vow</HI> and <HI>Promise</HI> to him; advancing the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Darkness,</HI> which his Son the Holy <HI>Jesus</HI> came to <HI>destroy</HI>; acting directly contrary to one great <HI>End</HI> and <HI>Design</HI> of his coming into the World. And <HI>All This</HI> but to <HI>Repair</HI> a Loss, <HI>Regain</HI> an Ease, or <HI>Remove</HI> an <HI>Affliction</HI>; which, without God's <HI>leave,</HI> he has no <HI>Power</HI> to do, and which God sent to a <HI>good</HI> and <HI>merciful</HI> End; and when that <HI>End</HI> is an∣swered, will <HI>remove</HI> it: Which, till he <HI>sees best</HI> to do, 'tis <HI>not best</HI> for you to <HI>desire.</HI></P>
<P>And now if you'll <HI>fly</HI> in his <HI>Face</HI> for this, Go, consider and see who <HI>first</HI> set his <HI>Face</HI> against the <HI>other: Your God</HI> against <HI>You</HI>; or <HI>You</HI> against <HI>Your God.</HI></P>

<P>Would you be content to have your <HI>God</HI> set his Face against you <HI>in the Day of Affliction?</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Day</HI> and <HI>Hour</HI> awakes every one of us. And nothing will <HI>sweeten</HI> or <HI>alleviate</HI> an <HI>Affliction</HI> so <HI>truly</HI> and so <HI>much</HI> as the <HI>secret, inward, joyous</HI> Ap∣prehensions, that they come from a ten∣der
<PB N="37" REF="36"/>
Father, whose <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Goodness</HI> has merciful <HI>Designs</HI> and <HI>Ends</HI> in them, though <HI>we</HI> see them not. The sweet <HI>Il∣lapses</HI> of the <HI>Divine Love</HI> with them, will make them <HI>supportable</HI> and <HI>easie.</HI></P>
<P>But how <HI>intolerable</HI> must an Affliction be, how heavy the Load, and how in∣supportable the Pressure, when it comes with the <HI>Face of the Lord set against us</HI> too, with just Apprehensions of his <HI>Wrath</HI> and <HI>Anger.</HI></P>
<P>This must be a little <HI>Image</HI> of <HI>Hell</HI> on <HI>Earth</HI>; a little kind of <HI>Foretaste</HI> of the <HI>Sorrows</HI> of Eternity; an <HI>Image</HI> and little <HI>Resemblance</HI> of that State, where <HI>their Worm dieth not, and their Fire is not quenched.</HI></P>
<P>If in this Day and Hour of Affliction it be thus insupportable to have <HI>his Face set against</HI> thee, consider <HI>now</HI> how just 'tis it should be so: When you first <HI>de∣sert</HI> Him; set your <HI>Face against</HI> Him; <HI>reject</HI> or <HI>cast off</HI> his Protection and his Providence; will not stay for his <HI>Wis∣dom,</HI> and his <HI>Time,</HI> and his <HI>Goodness</HI> to Relieve and Ease you, in his Blessing of <HI>prudent, just</HI> and <HI>lawful</HI> Means: But will look upon the <HI>Devil</HI> and his <HI>accursed Spirits,</HI> as your <HI>better Friends</HI>; and give

your self up to be <HI>assisted</HI> or <HI>reliev'd, eas'd</HI> or <HI>directed</HI> by them, or their <HI>wretch∣ed Agents.</HI></P>

<P>And as little, certainly, would you have him <HI>set his Face against you,</HI> or lie under the just Apprehension of his <HI>Dis∣pleasure,</HI> and his <HI>Wrath, In the days of Prosperity.</HI></P>
<P>Without the sweet <HI>Illapses</HI> of the <HI>di∣vine Love</HI>; and the rational well-ground∣ed <HI>Hopes</HI> of the <HI>Care, Protection</HI> and <HI>Fa∣vour</HI> of our God, and of the living in a State <HI>acceptable</HI> to him; there can be no such thing as <HI>Prosperity</HI> in this Life.</P>
<P>The <HI>Stings</HI> and <HI>Gnawings,</HI> the <HI>Dissatis∣factions</HI> and <HI>Uneasiness</HI> of a <HI>guilty</HI> Breast will sowre and imbitter all Enjoyments of the World; mix <HI>Gall</HI> and <HI>Wormwood</HI> with them.</P>
<P>The true <HI>Sedateness, Serenity</HI> and <HI>Tranquillity</HI> of Mind, is only the <HI>Result</HI> of those Consolations which the Holy <HI>Spirit</HI> of God gives upon an undissembled <HI>Purity, Probity</HI> and <HI>Sanctity</HI> of Life.</P>
<P>The sweet <HI>Emotions,</HI> the delicious <HI>Re∣lishes,</HI> and the holy <HI>Joy,</HI> which these raise

in, and leave upon the Soul are <HI>such</HI> as no Enemy can <HI>reach</HI> or <HI>meddle</HI> with: Which <HI>Men</HI> or <HI>Devils</HI> cannot <HI>take</HI> from us.</P>
<P>And will you part with these <HI>Emotions, Relishes</HI> and <HI>Joys,</HI> and give them up to <HI>him</HI> and his accursed <HI>Spirits</HI> only to be eas'd of an <HI>Affliction</HI> sent you by a tender Father; to <HI>wise</HI> and <HI>good,</HI> and <HI>kind</HI> Ends.</P>
<P>Would you think it a <HI>greater Kind∣ness</HI> from the <HI>Devil</HI> to <HI>remove</HI> it, than 'twas in God to <HI>send it?</HI> (When he can't remove it neither (as I have often said) without the <HI>Leave</HI> of your God.)</P>
<P>Will you <HI>trust him</HI> farther than you'll <HI>trust</HI> your <HI>God?</HI> And think that he will <HI>do more</HI> for you than your <HI>God?</HI> That <HI>God</HI> who has given you a <HI>thousand</HI> Mer∣cies for <HI>one</HI> Affliction: And yet for that <HI>one Affliction</HI> you'll <HI>desert</HI> and <HI>leave</HI> him; and <HI>forget</HI> all his other <HI>Mercies.</HI></P>
<P>Let not this be <HI>said</HI> or <HI>remembred</HI> of you at the Resurrection, when the <HI>Crowns</HI> and <HI>Palms</HI> of Eternity come to be dis∣pos'd of.</P>

<P>Nor would you have the <HI>Face of God set against you,</HI> sure, when the cold <HI>Sweat</HI> shall sit upon your <HI>Brows</HI>; and your <HI>mourning Relations</HI> shall stand round your <HI>Bedside,</HI> and come and take their <HI>last leave</HI> of you: When nothing shall be so <HI>welcome</HI> to you as a Prayer-book; no <HI>Com∣pany</HI> like a <HI>Guide</HI> of Souls; no <HI>Imploy∣ment</HI> but <HI>Devotion</HI>; and you shall stand upon the <HI>Threshold</HI> of a <HI>New-World.</HI> By <HI>that time</HI> you would not surely have the <HI>Face of him set against you,</HI> from whom you will infinitely desire the Approbation of <HI>well-done Good,</HI> &amp;c. And from whom you would desire the Character of <HI>Moses,</HI> beyond all the Treasures of the <HI>Indies,</HI> Joshua i.2. <HI>Moses my servant is dead.</HI></P>
<P>And if you would not then have the <HI>Face of him set against you,</HI> from whose <HI>Mouth</HI> you would in that <HI>Day</HI> and <HI>Hour, pant</HI> and <HI>sigh,</HI> and <HI>languish</HI> for this Approbation; (O why) will you <HI>set your Face against him</HI> now? <HI>Trust</HI> his <HI>Enemies</HI> farther than <HI>him</HI> now?

<HI>them</HI> against <HI>him</HI>; and expect <HI>Relief</HI> or <HI>Ease, Direction</HI> or <HI>Assistance,</HI> from <HI>them</HI> rather than from <HI>him.</HI></P>
<P>And I doubt not but you'll say, you would least of all have him set <HI>his Face against</HI> you in the <HI>Day of Judgment.</HI></P>
<P>When the Arch-Angels Trump shall summon the <HI>trembling World</HI> to appear before the Throne of God, and to come and take their <HI>last Sentence</HI> and <HI>Consig∣nation</HI> to their Eternal State; The <HI>Devil,</HI> whom you have <HI>recourse</HI> to now, will be then your <HI>grand Accuser.</HI></P>
<P>He whom you <HI>trust</HI> so far <HI>now,</HI> for <HI>Relief</HI> or <HI>Direction,</HI> will lie <HI>hard</HI> and <HI>bitterly</HI> against you <HI>then</HI>; and be your <HI>implacable Witness,</HI> and <HI>that</HI> even for <HI>this</HI> too.</P>
<P>He to whom you go for <HI>Help now,</HI> will <HI>then</HI> very bitterly plead <HI>this</HI> against you, That you <HI>did so. Then</HI> you will need an <HI>Advocate</HI> to answer his <HI>Obje∣ctions:</HI> And <HI>this Advocate</HI> you'll desert and provoke now; and draw him to set <HI>his Face against you:</HI> Hoping by seeking to the <HI>Devil</HI> in need, that he would be <HI>kinder</HI> to you than your <HI>God.</HI></P>
<P>How should but the bare <HI>mention</HI> of such things as these, set the <HI>guilty Soul</HI> a

<HI>trembling?</HI> And make it appear <HI>evil and bitter</HI> to him, thus to have <HI>forsaken the Lord,</HI> in any Degrees or Measures, <HI>Jer.</HI> ii.19.</P>
<P>Come, rather <HI>accuse</HI> your self, and prevent the <HI>grand Accuser:</HI> And humbly, and with Resignation of Soul trust <HI>him</HI> now on whom alone you are to <HI>trust</HI> in the <HI>Hour</HI> of <HI>Death,</HI> and the <HI>Day</HI> of <HI>Judg∣ment.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>tremble</HI> ever at the Thoughts of trusting him for any (the least) <HI>Relief, Direction,</HI> or <HI>Ease,</HI> who for <HI>one Affliction</HI> remov'd, (if he can and do remove it) <HI>ex∣pects</HI> and <HI>desires</HI> you should bear the <HI>Afflictions</HI> of <HI>Eternity.</HI></P>

<HEAD>§ XVIII. The Causes of this Impiety.</HEAD>
<P>If in the <HI>last place</HI> you would consider <HI>deeply</HI> and <HI>tenderly</HI>; with a close and piercing Thought, the <HI>Reasons</HI> of Mens <HI>giving way</HI> to this Impiety, of <HI>being</HI> or <HI>desiring to be</HI> a <HI>Wizzard,</HI> or <HI>Conjurer</HI> or <HI>seeking to them</HI> that are; this will make it appear more <HI>tremendous</HI> and <HI>shameful</HI> yet.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="42"/>And usually 'tis <HI>one,</HI> or <HI>all</HI> of these <HI>Seven.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>Pride, or Vain-glory.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>Discontent.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>Malice, Revenge and Envy.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>4. <HI>Covetousness, or an eager Love of the World.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. <HI>Impatience, and Immortification of Spirit.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>6. <HI>Distrust of the divine Providence.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>7. <HI>Want of Love to God: In Submission his Will, and to his Wisdom.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>And no wonder if such <HI>dismal Causes</HI> produce so <HI>bad Effects.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Pride,</HI> or <HI>Vain-glory.</HI></P>
<P>A Desire of being <HI>thought something,</HI> in <HI>Learning,</HI> or <HI>Knowledge</HI> above others, no doubt, has given the Devil very often a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> occasion.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="43"/>He himself is a <HI>proud Spirit,</HI> and he is willing to cherish that <HI>assimilating Vice,</HI> in any. It threw <HI>him</HI> out of <HI>Heaven,</HI> and he would willingly have it <HI>throw others thence</HI> too. Whereas the <HI>first Ver¦tue</HI> of our Lord's <HI>Sermon,</HI> to countermine him, was Humility: <HI>Blessed are the poor in Spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>But what a dreadfully <HI>mistaken Excel∣lency</HI> is this to be <HI>proud</HI> of: To have the <HI>Favour, Correspondence, Assistance,</HI> and <HI>Guidance</HI> of the <HI>accursed</HI> Spirits of Dark∣ness, at the Expence of <HI>his Favour, in which there is Life,</HI> Psal. 30<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. And who has said, <HI>Learn of me, for I am meek, and lowly in Heart.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. A second Cause of this Impiety, is <HI>Discontent.</HI></P>
<P>An <HI>uneasie,</HI> and <HI>unreasonable</HI> Sin.</P>
<P>A <HI>tender Father</HI> for a <HI>thousand Mer∣cies,</HI> gives us (and sees it necessary to give us) <HI>one Affl<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tion:</HI> And we will <HI>fly in his Face,</HI> because he <HI>does:</HI> And run to the <HI>Devil</HI> for <HI>Help</HI> in Hopes, he will be <HI>kinder</HI> to us. Whereas for the <HI>removal</HI> of one Affliction, he would bring upon us
<PB N="45" REF="44"/>
a <HI>thousand Miseries</HI> for a <HI>thousand Ages.</HI></P>
<P>While our God gives us a <HI>thousand Blessings,</HI> and sends us an <HI>Affliction</HI> to bring us the safer home to <HI>ten thousand</HI> more.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="19" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XIX.</HEAD>
<P>Another Cause of this horrid Impiety, is <HI>Malice:</HI> Or <HI>Revenge</HI> and <HI>Envy; Spite</HI> and a <HI>bitter Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>This pleases the grand <HI>Enemy</HI> of <HI>Man∣kind</HI> extreamly: Likens our <HI>Spirit</HI> to his <HI>own</HI>; and <HI>pre-disposes us,</HI> and gives him <HI>advantage.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis indeed a <HI>Temper</HI> so agreeable to his <HI>haughty, implacable,</HI> and <HI>malicious</HI> Disposition, as brings some <HI>pretty near</HI> to him, before they have recourse to <HI>Wiz∣zards</HI> and <HI>seek</HI> to them. And it pleases him the <HI>more,</HI> because 'tis a Disposition <HI>so contrary</HI> to the Prince of <HI>Peace,</HI> and the God of <HI>Love.</HI></P>
<P>And if he can boil up the <HI>bitter Spirit</HI> high enough to fit it to be <HI>deserted</HI> by the <HI>Spirit</HI> of God; he will soon shew it ways (if he be thus permitted) to <HI>revenge</HI> an <HI>Enemy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="45"/>And <HI>then</HI> he has a <HI>double Ty</HI> upon them: Not only by the Vices of <HI>Ma∣lice, Envy</HI> and <HI>Revenge,</HI> (which are so contrary to <HI>Heaven,</HI> and the Temper that reigns in the <HI>Element</HI> of <HI>Love</HI>) But he gains <HI>by them</HI> a <HI>dependence</HI> upon <HI>Him</HI> to <HI>assist</HI> them in doing <HI>mischief</HI>; and to ob∣lige <HI>that Malice.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis true, blessed be God, he does not permit this <HI>often:</HI> Yet he <HI>sometimes</HI> does, as he did in the case of <HI>Job.</HI></P>
<P>But then, if he do <HI>permit this</HI> a little; <HI>Permit,</HI> I mean, the Devil or his Agents to <HI>afflict</HI> Men, he always gives those that <HI>look</HI> up to him, and <HI>depend</HI> on him, and <HI>desert</HI> him not, either a <HI>way to escape</HI>; or something <HI>better</HI> than <HI>That</HI> would have been.</P>
<P>And while I am speaking of <HI>Revenge</HI> and <HI>Malice,</HI> and of the <HI>eager Sowerness</HI> of an impotent, restless and bitter <HI>Spirit,</HI> as one great <HI>Motive,</HI> and <HI>Fitness,</HI> and <HI>Pre∣disposition,</HI> to <HI>be,</HI> or to <HI>desire to be</HI> a Wiz∣zard, or to be seeking to them that <HI>are</HI>; Let me observe one thing: The difference between the <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>these Wretches,</HI> and the <HI>Spirit</HI> of a <HI>Christian.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="46"/>The malicious Agents of the Devil <HI>sleep not,</HI> (Prov. iv.16.) <HI>except they have done mischief, and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>Spirit</HI> of a <HI>Christian</HI> not on∣ly sleeps sweetly, but gains ground for <HI>Heaven</HI> by his Enemy's <HI>Bitterness.</HI> His Enemy's putting himself <HI>back</HI> in his Ac∣counts for <HI>Eternity,</HI> gives him an occa∣sion of adding <HI>some Jewels</HI> more to his <HI>Crown</HI> of Glory: And he (the good Man) <HI>lays up</HI> a little more <HI>Treasure</HI> in Heaven, by such opportunities of exercising his <HI>Piety, Charity</HI> and <HI>Mercy.</HI> And while the <HI>bitter Spirit</HI> goes for the Aid of the Devil to <HI>mischief</HI> and <HI>revenge</HI> his Enemy, the <HI>Christian Spirit</HI> with <HI>sweetness, ease</HI> and <HI>temper,</HI> looks up to him who said, <HI>Father forgive them, they know not what they do.</HI></P>
<P>And when he does thus <HI>look up</HI> to him, and to the new strange <HI>lovely World</HI> of Beatified Spirits, that he may <HI>smile</HI> upon each other in the <HI>Element</HI> of <HI>Love,</HI> can say: <HI>Blessed Jesu, grant I may carry my Enemies in my Heart to intercede for them, though they deserve it not, and have banish'd me from theirs; a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thou carriest me in thine, without re∣garding
<PB N="48" REF="47"/>
my unworthiness: and that in all Circumstances, whether good or evil, I may have thy Cross before my Eyes, to sweeten my Affliction, to calm my Pas∣sions, to break my own Will, to beat down Self-love, and to draw from this Fountain such Grace as is necessary to lead a Chri¦stian, that is a crucified, Life.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="20" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XX.</HEAD>
<P>A fourth Cause of this Impiety of <HI>seeking to,</HI> and <HI>consulting Wizzards,</HI> these Agents of the Devil, is <HI>Covetous∣ness,</HI> and an <HI>eager Love</HI> of the World.</P>
<P>As if when the <HI>holy God</HI> has permit∣ted any thing to be <HI>taken</HI> from us, we would <HI>have</HI> it again from the Devil, ra∣ther than be <HI>without</HI> it.</P>
<P>I shall not stay to lay all the dismal <HI>Load</HI> upon this, that it would <HI>fairly bear</HI>; But only stay to <HI>ask</HI> one humble <HI>Question:</HI> When God thinks fit to <HI>take</HI> any thing from us, is it fit we should eagerly desire to <HI>keep it?</HI></P>
<P>Much less is it <HI>fit</HI> we should use the unlawful <HI>means</HI> of having recourse to the Agents of the <HI>Spirits</HI> of Darkness
<PB N="49" REF="48"/>
As if we would send the Devil (if we could) to <HI>wrest</HI> a <HI>Restitution</HI> out of God's <HI>Hands.</HI></P>
<P>Another <HI>Cause</HI> of this horrid Wicked∣ness, is <HI>Impatience and Immortification of Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>We can easily say with <HI>Job, The Lord gave, Blessed be the Name of the Lord:</HI> But we have not Resignation enough to say, <HI>The Lord hath taken away, Blessed be his Name.</HI></P>
<P>When indeed this would be the true and proper <HI>Time</HI> of the <HI>Tryal</HI> of our <HI>Allegiance, Fidelity</HI> and <HI>Love.</HI> To <HI>love Him then,</HI> when his <HI>Hand</HI> lies a little <HI>hard</HI> upon us.</P>
<P>For, let him please but to permit your <HI>Health,</HI> or <HI>Good-Name,</HI> or <HI>Possessions,</HI> to be taken <HI>away,</HI> you'll run to the accursed <HI>Spirits</HI> of <HI>Darkness,</HI> in hopes they will find a way to <HI>relieve</HI> you, and be <HI>kinder</HI> to you than your <HI>God.</HI> Who, all the while, by an Affliction only designs to turn your Eyes a little more closely to his <HI>Kingdom</HI>; or to <HI>hedge</HI> in your <HI>way</HI> to it; or to <HI>lead</HI> and <HI>conduct</HI> you the safer thither; or some other <HI>Kindness</HI> or <HI>Mercy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="49"/>The next Cause of this Impiety is, <HI>Di∣strust of the divine Providence.</HI></P>
<P>As if God had <HI>given</HI> up the <HI>Care</HI> and <HI>Government,</HI> and <HI>Conduct</HI> of the World to the <HI>Devil:</HI> And you would <HI>thankfully</HI> receive from <HI>him</HI> and his accursed Agents, what your <HI>God</HI> in <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Mercy</HI> has permitted to be <HI>taken</HI> from you; and will himself give <HI>again</HI> to you, or some∣thing <HI>better</HI> for <HI>it</HI>; if with humble <HI>Love</HI> you <HI>depend</HI> on him.</P>
<P>Or, as if, an <HI>Affliction</HI> should be <HI>thank∣fully receiv'd</HI> from God, you would ra∣ther <HI>thankfully receive</HI> a Removal of it from the <HI>Devil</HI>; who, of himself too, has no Power to <HI>grant it:</HI> And if it be <HI>per∣mitted</HI> by <HI>God</HI> to be granted by the Hands and Power of the Devil, or his <HI>Agents</HI> is a dreadful <HI>Judgment,</HI> and not a <HI>Mercy.</HI></P>
<P>The last of the most <HI>common Causes</HI> of this Impiety is, <HI>want of Love to God</HI>; that would <HI>sweetly incline</HI> you to submit to his <HI>Will</HI> and to his <HI>Wisdom.</HI></P>
<P>We sometimes say we are willing his <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Goodness,</HI> and <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Care</HI> should chuse for us, in all things: But yet we are apt to think we could <HI>chuse better</HI> for our selves: Nay, what's infi∣nitely
<PB N="51" REF="50"/>
worse than <HI>that</HI>; such as I am now speaking of, think the <HI>Devil</HI> and his <HI>Wizzards</HI> and <HI>Agents,</HI> can <HI>chuse better</HI> for them.</P>
<P>And would you have this <HI>said</HI> or <HI>re∣membred</HI> of you, and charg'd upon you, when the Arch-Angel's Voice shall mingle with the Crack and the Noise of the dissolving World?</P>
<P>To conclude,</P>
<P>Instead of ever giving the least way to the least <HI>Correspondence</HI> with these <HI>Agents</HI> of the <HI>Spirits</HI> of <HI>Darkness</HI>; I mean, in∣stead of seeking to any <HI>Wizzard, Con∣jurer,</HI> or <HI>Witch,</HI> in any case whatever, <HI>start</HI> back and <HI>tremble</HI> at the Thought.</P>
<P>And thank your God, That he has <HI>gi∣ven</HI> you any thing that you can <HI>lose</HI> for him, be it <HI>Health, Possessions,</HI> or any thing else; rather than <HI>receive</HI> the least part of them from the <HI>Hands</HI> of the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P>And in the use only of <HI>Rational, Na∣tural, Prudent, Pious</HI> and <HI>Lawful</HI> Means, look up to a tender <HI>Father,</HI> who <HI>looks down</HI> and sees your <HI>Needs</HI> and <HI>Dangers:</HI> And chearfully <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on him. He will
<PB N="52" REF="51"/>
assuredly <HI>direct</HI> to the <HI>best Means,</HI> and <HI>bless</HI> them too: But then it must not be in <HI>your Time,</HI> but in <HI>his.</HI></P>
<P>And if he do not presently <HI>direct</HI> you to them, 'tis because he <HI>yet</HI> sees it <HI>best</HI> you should not be <HI>directed</HI> to them.</P>
<P>Or If he do not think fit either to <HI>di∣rect</HI> you to them, or to <HI>bless</HI> them; 'tis (if you thus <HI>affectionately,</HI> and <HI>humbly rely</HI> on him) because he designs some∣thing <HI>better</HI> for you in <HI>Lieu</HI> of it.</P>
<P>And on this you may <HI>securely rest.</HI></P>
<P>So that (dear Cousin) if you, or any Friend of yours, should by any <HI>Loss</HI> or <HI>Pain, Hardship,</HI> or <HI>Reproach; Hope,</HI> or <HI>Desire; Fear,</HI> or other <HI>Passion,</HI> incline ever to a Thought of seeking to a <HI>Con∣jurer, Witch,</HI> or <HI>Wizzard,</HI> do not in the least <HI>consent</HI> or <HI>yield</HI> to the <HI>Temptation,</HI> till you have read a <HI>few Leaves</HI> of this Book: And have <HI>kneel'd down,</HI> and have offered up to God these <HI>three</HI> short <HI>Prayers</HI> following; which your <HI>dearest Mother,</HI> the <HI>Church,</HI> piously recommends to your Use.</P>
