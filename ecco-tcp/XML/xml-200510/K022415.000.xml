<Q>EVEN AS OUR BELOVED BROTHER PAUL ALSO, ACCORD∣ING
TO THE WISDOM GIVEN UNTO HIM, HATH WRIT∣TEN
UNTO YOU; AS ALSO IN ALL HIS EPISTLES
SPEAKING IN THEM OF THOSE THINGS; IN WHICH
ARE SOME THINGS HARD TO BE UNDERSTOOD, WHICH
THEY THAT ARE UNLEARNED, AND UNSTABLE,
WREST, AS THEY DO ALSO THE OTHER SCRIPTURES,
UNTO THEIR OWN DESTRUCTION.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT must not be dissembled that there are many real diffi∣culties
in the Christian scriptures; whilst at the same time
more, I believe, and greater may justly be imputed to certain
maxims of interpretation, which have obtained authority
without reason, and are received without enquiry.—One of
these, as I apprehend, is the expecting to find in the present
circumstances of christianity, a meaning for, or something
answering to, every appellation and expression which occurs
in scripture; or in other words, the applying to the personal
condition of Christians at this day, those titles, phrases, pro∣positions
and arguments, which belong solely to the situation
of christianity at its first institution.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="4"/>
I am aware of an objection which weighs much with many
serious tempers, namely, that to suppose any part of scripture
to be inapplicable to us, is to suppose a part of scripture to be
useless; which seems to detract from the perfection we attri∣bute
to these oracles of our salvation.—To this I can only an∣swer,
that it would have been one of the strangest things in
the world, if the writings of the new testament had not, like
all other books, been composed for the apprehension, and
consequently adapted to the circumstances, of the persons they
were addressed to; and that it would have been equally strange,
if the great, and in many respects the inevitable, alterations,
which have taken place in those circumstances, did not vary
the application of scripture language.</P>
<P>I design in the following discourse to propose some examples
of this variation, from which you will judge, as I proceed, of
the truth and importance of our general observation.</P>
<P>1. At the time the scriptures were written, none were <HI>bap∣tized</HI>
but converts, and none were converted but from con∣viction,
and conviction produced for the most part a cor∣responding
reformation of life and manners.—Hence <HI>Baptism</HI>
was only another name for conversion, and conversion was
supposed to be sincere—in this sense was our Savior's promise,
"<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mark xvi. 16.</NOTE> he that believeth and is <HI>baptized</HI> shall be saved," and in the
same his command to St. Paul "<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Acts xxii. 16.</NOTE> arise and be <HI>baptized</HI> and
wash away thy sins;" this was that <HI>baptism</HI> "for the remission
of sins," to which St. Peter<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Acts ii, 38,</NOTE> invited the Jews upon the day of
Pentecost; that "<HI>washing</HI> of regeneration" by which as St. Paul<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Titus iii. 5.</NOTE> writes to Titus "he saved us." Now when we come
to speak of the <HI>baptism</HI> which obtains in most christian
churches at present, where no conversion is supposed, or
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
possible; it is manifest, that if these expressions be applied at
all, they must be applied with extreme qualification and
reserve.</P>
<P>2. The community of christians were at first a handful of
men connected amongst themselves by the strictest union, and
divided from the rest of the world by a real difference of prin∣ciple
and persuasion, and what was more observable, by many
outward peculiarities of worship and behavior.—This
society considered collectively, and as a <HI>body,</HI> were set apart
from the rest of mankind for a more gracious dispensation, as
well as actually distinguished by a superior purity of life and
conversation.—In this view, and in opposition to the unbe∣lieving
world, they were denominated in scripture by titles of
great seeming dignity and import—they were "<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 33. i. 6, 7.</NOTE> elect,"
"called," "faints"—they were "<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">viii. 1.</NOTE> in Christ"—they were
"<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. ii. 9.</NOTE> a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a
"peculiar people."—That is, these terms were employed to
distinguish the professors of christianity from the rest of man∣kind,
in the same manner as the names of Greek and Barba∣rian,
Jew and Gentile, distinguished the people of Greece and
Israel from other nations. The application of such phrases
to the whole <HI>body</HI> of christians is become now obscure; partly,
because it is not easy to conceive of christians as a <HI>body</HI> at all,
by reason of the extent of their name and numbers, and the
little visible union that subsists among them; and partly, be∣cause
the heathen world with whom they were compared, and
to which comparison these phrases relate, is now ceased, or is
removed from our observation.—Supposing therefore these
expressions to have a perpetual meaning, and either forgetting
the original use of them, or finding <HI>that,</HI> at this time, in a
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
great measure exhausted and insignificant, we resort to a sense
and an application of them, easier it may be to our compre∣hension,
but extremely foreign from the design of their au∣thors,
namely, to distinguish individuals amongst us, the pro∣fessors
of Christianity from one another—agreeably to which
Idea the most flattering of these names, the "elect," "called,"
"saints," have by bold and unlearned men been appropriated
to themselves and their own party with a presumption and
conceit, injurious to the reputation of our religion amongst
"them that are without," and extremely disgusting to the so∣ber
part of its professors: whereas, that such titles were in∣tended
in a sense common to all christian converts is well
argued from many places in which they occur, in which places
you may plainly substitute the terms <HI>convert</HI> or <HI>converted</HI> for
the strongest of these phrases without any alteration of the
author's meaning, e. g. "<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. vi. 1.</NOTE> dare any of you go to Law before
the unjust and not before the saints?" "<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">vii. 18.</NOTE> is any man <HI>called</HI> be∣ing
circumcised, let him not become uncircumcised?"—"<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. v. 13.</NOTE> the
church that is at Babylon <HI>elected</HI> together with you saluteth
you"—"<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rom. xvi. 7.</NOTE> salute Andronicus and Junia who were <HI>in Christ</HI>
before me."</P>
<P>3. In opposition to the Jews who were so much offended
by the preaching of the Gospel to the Gentiles, St. Paul main∣tains
with great industry, that it was God Almighty's inten∣tion
from <HI>the first</HI> to substitute at a fit season into the place of
the rejected Israelites a society of men, taken indifferently out
of all nations under heaven, and admitted to be the people of
God upon easier and more comprehensive terms—this is ex∣pressed
in the Epistle to the Ephesians, as follows;"<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Eph. i. 9, 10. also see Eph. iii. 5, 6.</NOTE> having
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his
good pleasure which he hath <HI>purposed in himself,</HI> that in the
dispensation of the fulness of times, he might gather together
in one all things in Christ."—The scheme of collecting such
a society was what God <HI>foreknow</HI> before the foundation of the
world; was what he did <HI>predestinate;</HI> was the <HI>eternal purpose</HI>
which he purposed in Christ Jesus: and by consequence this
society in their collective capacity were the objects of this <HI>fore∣knowledge,
predestination,</HI> and <HI>purpose;</HI> that is, in the language
of the apostles, they were they "<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rom, viii. 29.</NOTE> whom he did <HI>foreknow,</HI>" they
"whom he did <HI>predestinate</HI>"—they were "<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Eph, i. 4.</NOTE> <HI>chosen in Christ</HI>
before the foundation of the world"—they were "<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. i, 2.</NOTE> <HI>elect</HI>
according to the <HI>foreknowledge</HI> of God the Father." This doc∣trine
has nothing in it harsh or obscure.—But what have we
made of it?—The rejection of the Jews, and the adopting an∣other
community into their place, composed, whilst it was
carrying on, an object of great magnitude in the attention of
the inspired writers who understood and observed it.—This
event, which engaged so much the thoughts of the Apostle, is
now only read of, and hardly that—the reality and the import∣ance
of it are little known or attended to.—Losing sight there∣fore
of the proper occasion of these expressions, yet willing
after our fashion to adapt them to ourselves, and finding no∣thing
else in our circumstances that suited with them, we have
learnt at length to apply them to the final destiny of indivi∣duals
at the day of judgement; and upon this foundation has
been erected a doctrine which lays the ax at once to the root
of all religion, that of an absolute appointment to salvation or
perdition, independent of ourselves or any thing we can do:
and, what is extraordinary, those very arguments and ex∣pressions,
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
(Rom. Chap. ix. x. xi.) which the Apostle employed
to vindicate the impartial mercies of God, against the narrow
and excluding claims of Jewish prejudice, have been inter∣preted
to establish a dispensation the most arbitrary and par∣tial
that could be devised.</P>
<P>4. The conversion of a grown person from heathenism to
christianity, which is the case of conversion commonly in∣tended
in the epistles, was a change of which we have now no
just conception—it was a new name, a new language, a new
society; a new faith, a new hope; a new object of worship,
a new rule of life; a history was disclosed full of discovery and
surprise; a prospect of futurity was unfolded, beyond imagi∣nation
awful and august; the same description applies in a
great part though not entirely to the conversion of a Jew.—
This, accompanied as it was with the pardon of every former
sin, (Romans iii. 25.) was such an aera in a man's life, so
remarkable a period in his recollection, such a revolution of
every thing that was most important to him, as might well
admit of those strong figures and significant allusions by which
it is described in scripture—it was a "<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Tit. iii. 5.</NOTE> <HI>regeneration,</HI>" or a
new birth—it was to be "<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">John i. 13. iii. 5.</NOTE> born again of God and of the
spirit"—it was to be "<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rom. vi. 2, 13.</NOTE> dead to sin," and" alive from the
dead"—it was to be "<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Col. ii. 12.</NOTE> buried with Christ in baptism, and
raised together with him"—it was "<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. v. 17.</NOTE> a new creature" and
"<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Eph. iv. 24.</NOTE> a new creation"—it was a translation from the condition
of "<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Gal. iv. 7.</NOTE> slaves to that of sons"—from "<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Eph. ii, 19.</NOTE> strangers and foreign∣ers
to be fellow citizens with the saints and of the houshold of
God." It is manifest that no change equal or similar to the
conversion of a heathen can be experienced by us, or by any
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
one educated in a christian country, and to whom the facts,
precepts and hopes of christianity have been from his infancy
familiar—yet we will retain the same language—and what
has been the consequence? One sort of men, observing nothing
in the lives of christians, corresponding to the magnificence,
if I may so say, of these expressions, have been tempted to
conclude, that the expressions themselves had no foundation
in truth and nature, or in any thing but the enthusiasm of
their authors.—Others again understand these phrases to sig∣nify
nothing more, than that gradual amendment of life and
conversation, which reason and religion sometimes produce in
particular christians—of which interpretation it is truly said,
that it degrades too much the proper force of language, to ap∣ply
expressions of such energy and import to an event, so or∣dinary
in its own nature, and which is common to christianity
with every other moral institution. Lastly, a third sort, in
order to satisfy these expressions to their full extent, have
imagined to themselves certain perceptible impulses of the
Holy Ghost, by which, in an instant, and in a manner, no
doubt, sufficiently extraordinary, they are "<HI>regenerate</HI> and <HI>born
of the spirit</HI>"—they become "<HI>new creatures</HI>"—they are made
the "<HI>sons of God</HI>" who were before the "<HI>children of wrath</HI>"—
they are "<HI>freed,</HI> from sin," and "from death"—they are
chosen, that is, and sealed, without a possibility of fall, unto
final salvation.—Whilst the patrons of a more sober expo∣sition
have been often challenged, and sometimes confounded
with the question—if such expressions of scripture do not
mean <HI>this,</HI> what do they mean? To which we answer—no∣thing
—nothing, that is, to us—nothing to be found, or
sought for, in the present circumstances of christianity.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10"/>
More examples might be produced, in which the unwary
use of scripture language has been the occasion of difficulties
and mistakes—but I forbear—the present are sufficient to
show, that it behoves every one, who undertakes to explain
the scriptures, before he determine to whom or what an ex∣pression
is now a days to be applied, to consider diligently
whether it admit of any such application at all; or whether
it is not rather to be restrained to the precise circumstances
and occasion for which it was originally composed.</P>
<P>I make no apology for addressing this subject to this audi∣ence;
because whatever relates to the interpretation of scrip∣ture,
relates, as I conceive, to us; for, if, by any light we may
cast upon these ancient books, we can enable and invite the
people to read the Bible for themselves, we discharge in my
judgement the first duty of our function—ever bearing in
mind that we are the ministers not of our own same or fan∣cies,
but of the sincere Gospel of Jesus Christ.</P>
