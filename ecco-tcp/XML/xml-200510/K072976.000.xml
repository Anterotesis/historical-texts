<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>OWEVER unwor∣thy
these Scenes

LORDSHIP'S Pro∣tection,
the Design
with which some of them
<PB REF="3"/>
were written, cannot fail of
recommending them to ONE
who hath so gloriously distin∣guished
Himself in the Cause
of Liberty, to which the Cor∣ruption
I have here endea∣voured
to expose, may one Day
be a very fatal Enemy.</P>
<P>The Freedom of the Stage
is, perhaps, as well worth con∣tending
for, as that of the
Press. It is the Opinion of an
Author well known to Your
LORDSHIP, that Examples
work quicker and stronger on
the Minds of Men than Pre∣cepts.</P>
<P>This will, I believe, my
LORD, be found truer with
<PB REF="4"/>
regard to Politicks than to E∣thicks:
The most ridiculous
Exhibitions of Luxury or Ava∣rice
may likely have little Ef∣fect
on the Sensualist or the
Miser; but I fansy a lively Re∣presentation
of the Calamities
brought on a Country by ge∣neral
Corruption, might have a
very sensible and useful Effect
on the Spectators.</P>
<P><HI>Socrates,</HI> who owed his
Destruction greatly to the
Contempt brought on him by
the Comedies of <HI>Aristophanes,</HI>
is a lasting Instance of the
Force of Theatrical Ridicule:
Here, indeed, this Weapon
was used to an ill Purpose;
<PB REF="5"/>
but surely, what is able to
bring Wisdom and Virtue in∣to
Disrepute, will with great
Facility lay their Opposites
under a general Contempt.
There are among us who
seem so sensible of the Dan∣ger
of Wit and Humour, that
they are resolved to have no∣thing
to do with them: And
indeed they are in the right
on't; for Wit, like Hunger,
will be with great Difficulty re∣strained
from falling on, where
there is great Plenty and Variety
of Food.</P>
<P>But while the powerful
Sons of Dulness shed all their
Influence on their inferior Bre∣thren,
<PB REF="6"/>
be You, My LORD, who
are the most favourite Offspring
of the <HI>British</HI> Muses, the Pa∣tron
of their younger Children;
whom Your LORDSHIP has
as much Reason to love, as
others to fear; for you must
have seen, that to be celebra∣ted
by them, and applauded
by the more discerning and
worthy, are the only Rewards
which true Patriotism (a Word
scandalously ridicul'd by some)
can securely expect. And
here I am pleading the Cause
of others; for the only Title
I have to enrol my self in
the Number of those I have
recommended to Your Fa∣vour,
<PB REF="7"/>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Comedy was begun at <HI>Ley∣den</HI>
in the Year 1728, and after
it had been sketched out into a few loose
Scenes, was thrown by, and for a long
while no more thought of. It was origi∣nally
writ for my private Amusement;
as it would indeed have been little less
than Quixotism itself to hope any other
Fruits from attempting Characters wherein
the inimitable <HI>Cervantes</HI> so far excelled.
The Impossibility of going beyond, and the
extreme Difficulty of keeping pace with him,
were sufficient to infuse Despair into a very
adventurous Author.</P>
<P>I soon discovered too, that my too small
Experience in, and little Knowledge of the
World, had led me into an Error. I soon
found it infinitely more difficult than I
imagined, to vary the Scene, and give my
<PB REF="9"/>
Knight an Opportunity of displaying himself
in a different manner from that wherein he
appears in the Romance. Human Nature
is every where the same. And the Modes
and Habits of particular Nations do not
change it enough, sufficiently to distinguish
a <HI>Quixore</HI> in <HI>England</HI> from a <HI>Quixote</HI> in
<HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>In these Sentiments Mr. <HI>Booth</HI> and
Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> concurred with me, who, upon
seeing the aforesaid Sketch, both dissuaded
me from suffering it to be represented on
the Stage; and accordingly it was reman∣ded
back to my Shelf, where, probably, it
would have perished in Oblivion, had not
the Solicitations of the distrest Actors in
<HI>Drury-Lane</HI> prevail'd on me to revise it,
at the same time that it came into my
Head to add those Scenes concerning our
Elections.</P>
<P>Being thus altered, it was often rehearsed
on that Theatre, and a particular Day
appointed for its Action; but the Giant
<HI>Cajanus,</HI> of a Race who were always
<PB REF="10"/>
Enemies to our poor <HI>Don,</HI> deferred his Ap∣pearance
so long, that the Intervention of
the Actor's Benefits would have put it off
till the next Season, had I not brought it on
where now it appears.</P>
<P>I have troubled the Reader thus long, to
account for this Comedy's appearing as it
now does, and that he might distinguish
those Parts of it which were the Produc∣tion
of this Season from those which were
written in my more juvenile Years, and be∣fore
most of the Pieces with which I have
endeavoured to entertain the Publick.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<STAGE>MANAGER, AUTHOR.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANAGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>NO Prologue, Sir! The Audience will never bear
it. They will not bate you any thing of their
due.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Auth.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am the Audience's very humble Servant;
but they cannot make a Man write a Prologue, whe∣ther
he can or no.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, there is nothing easier: I have
known an Author bring three or four to the House
with one Play, and give us our Choice which we
would speak.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Auth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir; and I have now three in my Poc∣ket,
written by Friends, of which I choose none should
be spoke.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>How so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Auth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because they have been all spoke already twen∣ty
times over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me see them, pray.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Auth.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are written in such damn'd cramp Hands,
you will never be able to read them; but I will tell
you the Substance of them. One of them begins with
abusing the Writings of all my Cotemporaries, la∣menting
the fallen State of the Stage; and lastly, as∣suring
the Audience that this Play was written with a
Design to restore true Taste, and their approving it
is the best Symptom they can give of their having
any.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB REF="14"/>
<SPEAKER>Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and a very good Scheme.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Auth.</SPEAKER>
<P>May be so; but it hath been the Subject of
almost every Prologue for these ten Years last past.
The Second is in a different Cast: The first twelve
Lines inveigh against all Indecency on the Stage, and
the last twenty Lines shew you what it is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>That would do better for an Epilogue: But
what is the Third?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Auth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, the Third has some Wit in it, and
would have done very well, but for a Mistake.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay! What Mistake?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Auth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, the Author never read my Play, and
taking it for a regular Comedy of Five Acts, hath fal∣len
very severely on Farce: However, it is a pretty
good one, and will do very well for the first genteel
Comedy you bring on the Stage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>But don't you think a Play, with so odd a
Title as yours, requires to be a little explain'd? May
they not be too much surpris'd at some things?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Auth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all. The Audience, I believe, are all
acquainted with the Character of <HI>Don Quixote</HI> and
<HI>Sancho.</HI> I have brought them over into <HI>England,</HI> and
introduced them at an Inn in the Country, where, I
believe, no one will be surpris'd that the Knight finds
several People as mad as himself. This I could have
told them in forty dull Lines, if I would, but I rather
chose to let it alone; for, to tell you the Truth, I can
draw but one Conclusion from the Prologues I have
ever seen, that the Authors are so sensible of the De∣merits
of their Plays, that they desire to set the Au∣dience
asleep before they begin: But of what real Use
is a Bill of Fare to any Entertainment, where the
Guests are not left to their Choice what Part they will
pick at, but are oblig'd to swallow the Whole indif∣ferently?</P>
</SP>
<PB REF="15"/>
<STAGE>Enter a Player.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Play.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, the Audience make such a Noise with
their Canes, that, if we don't begin immediately, they
will beat the House down before the Play begins; and
it is not advisable to put them out of Humour, for
there are two or three of the loudest Cat-calls, in the
Gallery, that ever were heard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Auth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be not frightned at that. Those are only
some particular Friends of mine, who are to put on
the Face of Enemies at first, and be converted at the
End of the First Act.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>Order then to play away the Overture imme∣diately.
Come, Sir, what do you do with yourself?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Auth.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall dispose my self in some Part of the
House, where I shall see, and not be seen: And I can
assure you, Sir, if the Audience are but half as well
entertain'd with this Play, as I shall be my self, it will
go off with universal Applause.</P>

<P>Tell not me of <HI>Spain,</HI> Sir; I am an <HI>Englishman,</HI> where

I shall lay his <HI>Spaniardship</HI> fast in a Place, which he shall find it

get into <HI>Gibraltar.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>San.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's neither here nor there, as the old Saying is; many
are shut into one Place, and out of another. Men bar Houses
to keep Rogues out, and Jails to keep them in. He that's
hang'd for stealing a Horse to-day, has no reason to buy Oats
for him to-morrow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Guz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sirrah, your Horse, nor your Ass neither, shall have
any more Oats at my Expence; never were Masters and their
Beasts so like one another. The <HI>Don</HI> is just such another lean
Ramscallion as his—what d'ye call him—his <HI>Rozinante</HI>;
and thou art just such another squat Bag of Guts as thy <HI>Dapple.</HI>
Send my House and my Stable once well emptied of you, and
if ever I suffer a <HI>Spaniard</HI> to enter my Doors again, may I have
a whole Company of Soldiers quartered on me; for if I must
be eaten up, I had rather suffer by my own Country Rogues,
than foreign ones.</P>

Man of Fashion of Five Shillings, to Goal with him: But
the Man of Fashion may plunder a thousand Poor, and stay in

<P>'Tis pity then, that Fortune should contradict the Or∣der

Children according to their Minds, not to their Births; these
Squires should sow that Corn which they ride over. <HI>Sancho,</HI>
when I see a Gentleman in his own Coach-box, I regret the
Loss which some one has had of a Coachman; the Man who
toils all Day after a Partridge or a Pheasant, might serve his
Country by toiling after a Plough; and when I see a low,
mean, tricking Lord, I lament the Loss of an excellent At∣torney.

<P>Nay, nay, like enough; all Men cannot do all things;

want to get rid of one. Two Cuckolds see each other's Horns
when neither of them can see his own. Money is the Fruit of
Evil, as often as the Root of it. Charity seldom goes out of her

and yet he has talk'd what I could not understand neither, but
that's neither here nor there; an empty Purse causes a full

Wife; Conscience often stops at a Molehill, and leaps over a
Mountain; the Law guards us from all Evil but itself; what's

to stand, we invite him to spend his Money for the Honour of
his Party; and when both Parties have spent as much as they
are able, every honest Man will vote according to his Con∣science.</P>

<P>Ay, ay, Mr. <HI>Guzzle,</HI> I never gave a Vote contrary to
my Conscience. I have very earnestly recommended the Coun∣try-Interest
to all my Brethren: But before that, I recommend∣ed
the Town-Interest, that is, the Interest of this Corporation;
and first of all I recommended to every particular Man to take
a particular Care of himself. And it is with a certain way of
Reasoning, That he that serves me best, will serve the Town
best; and he that serves the Town best, will serve the Country
best.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quix.</SPEAKER>
<P>THOU hast, by this time, fully perceiv'd, <HI>Sancho,</HI> the
extreme Difficulties and Dangers of Knight-Er∣rantry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>San.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, and of 'Squire-Errantry too, an't please your

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quix.</SPEAKER>
<P>But Virtue is its own Reward.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>San.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Worship may have a Relish for these Rewards,
perhaps; but to speak truly, I am a poor plain Man, and know
nothing of these fine things; and for any Reward I have hither∣to
got, I had much rather have gone without it. As for an
Island, I believe I could relish it as well as another; but a Man
may catch cold while his Coat is making: And since you may
provide for me in a much easier way, if I might be so bold as
to speak—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quix.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou knowest I will deny thee nothing, which is fit
for me to give, or thee to take.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>San.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then if your Worship wou'd be so good as to set me
up in an Inn, I should make a rare Landlord; and it is a very
thriving Trade among the <HI>English.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quix.</SPEAKER>
<P>And couldst thou descend so low, ignoble Wretch?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>San.</SPEAKER>
<P>Any thing to get an honest Livelihood, which is more
than I find we are like to do in the way we are going on: For,
if I durst speak it—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="21" REF="36"/>
<SPEAKER>Quix.</SPEAKER>
<P>Speak fearlesly.—I will only impute it to thy Igno∣rance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>San.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then I find, Sir, that we are look'd on here to be,
neither more nor less, better or worse, than a couple of Mad∣men.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quix.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Sancho,</HI> I am not concern'd at the evil Opinion of
Men. Indeed, if we consider who are their Favourites, we
shall have no reason to be so fond of their Applause. Virtue,
<HI>Sancho,</HI> is too bright for their Eyes, and they dare not behold
her. Hypocrisy is the Deity they worship. Is not the Lawyer
often call'd an honest Man, when for a sneaking Fee he pleads
the Villain's Cause, or attempts to extort Evidence to the Con∣viction
of the Innocent? Does not the Physician live well in
his Neighbourhood, while he suffers them to bribe his Igno∣rance
to their Destruction? But why should I mention those
whose Profession 'tis to prey on others? Look thro' the World,
What is it recommends Men, but the Poverty, the Vice, and
the Misery of others? This, <HI>Sancho,</HI> they are sensible of, and
therefore, instead of endeavouring to make himself better, each
Man endeavours to make his Neighbour worse. Each Man ri∣ses
to Admiration by treading on Mankind. Riches and Power
accrue to the One, by the Destruction of Thousands. These
are the general Objects of the good Opinion of Men: Nay,
and that which is profess'd to be paid to Virtue, is seldom more
to any thing than a supercilious Contempt of our Neighbour.
What is a good-natur'd Man? Why, one, who seeing the
Want of his Friend, cries he pities him. Is this real? No:
If it was, he would relieve him. His Pity is triumphant Ar∣rogance
and Insult: It arises from his Pride, not from his
Compassion. <HI>Sancho,</HI> let them call me mad; I'm not mad e∣nough
to court their Approbation.</P>
</SP>

<P>Nay, Sir, for that matter, let him be as civil as he plea∣ses,
one Man's Money is as good as another's. You seem to

Tolls, and Inchantments? Hence from my Sight! or by the

<P>I don't know which is Master, nor which is Man, not
I; sometimes I think one is Master, and then again I think it is

most, and eats most; he is as bad as a Grayhound in a House;
there is no laying down any thing eatable, but if you turn your
Back, slap, he has it up. As for the Knight, as he calls
himself, he has more to pay for breaking Windows, than eat∣ing:
Wou'd I were well rid of him! He will sit you some∣times
in the Yard to guard the Castle, as he calls it; but I am
afraid his Design is to rob the House, if he could catch an Op∣portunity.

<P>The usual Madness of Mankind! Do you marry

'tis something whimsical, to make her miserable in order to

too little. No Match can be happy, which Love and For∣tune
do not conspire to make so. The greatest Addition of
either, illy supplies the intire Absence of the other; nor wou'd
Millions a Year make that Beast, in your Daughter's Eye, pre∣ferable
