<HEAD>To the <HI>AUTHOR</HI> of the <HI>ENQUIRY</HI>
into the Causes of the Decay of the
<HI>Dissenting Interest.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU will probably be surpriz'd at this
Address on occasion of your Enquiry,
so many months after the publication
of it. But my distance from the town,
and engagement in business, hinder'd
me from an early sight of it; and many accidents,
which 'tis of no importance to mention, oblig'd
me to delay finishing these papers, so soon as I in∣tended,
when I began to write them. On the
whole, as I am not attempting to criticise on your
performance, but only to offer some remarks,
which I hope may be of common use, if what I
say be just and important, it cannot be quite too
late; and if it be either false or trifling, it ap∣pears
after all too soon.</P>
<P>As I am persuaded that the Dissenting Cause is
founded on reason and truth, and that the honour
of God, and the publick good is nearly concern'd
in its support, you have my hearty thanks for that
generous zeal with which you have appear'd for
the defence of it. On this account, I should think
myself highly oblig'd to treat you with decency
and respect, how much soever my sentiments might
differ from yours, as to the particular causes of
its decay. And indeed, Sir, you have taken the
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
most effectual method in the world to prevent any
thing of a rude attack, by treating all whom you
mention, even the meanest and the weakest, with
remarkable candour and humanity.</P>
<P>But I have the happiness of agreeing with you
in far the greater part of what you advance. I
will not now debate, whether the principles of our
Dissent are less known than they formerly were;
and consequently whether that be, properly speak∣ing,
a cause of the late decay of our interest: but
I will readily grant, Sir, that it is highly necessary
they should be known; and I think you have done
us a great deal of service by setting them in so
easy, and yet in so strong a light. I hope it may
be a means of informing and establishing some,
who are too busy or too indolent to give themselves
the trouble of perusing what Dr. <HI>Calamy,</HI> Mr. <HI>Peirce,</HI>
and some others have written so copiously and so
judiciously upon the subject.</P>
<P>I farther apprehend, Sir, that nothing can be
said upon the case before us of more certain truth
or more solid importance, than what you have
frequently observ'd; <HI>viz.</HI> that our interest has re∣ceiv'd
great damage from our acting in a manner
directly opposite to our principles, by unscriptural
impositions, and uncharitable contentions with each
other. I hope many of us have seen our mistakes
here, and shall be careful for the future, to avoid
what has been attended with so many unhappy
consequences.</P>
<P>After having thus declar'd my agreement with
you, in the greater part of your discourse, I hope,
Sir, you will pardon me, if I add, that I cannot
think that you have exhausted your subject. To
speak freely, I think you have omitted some causes
of the decay of our interest, which are at least
as important as those you have handled. It
is the design of my present undertaking, to point
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
out some of the most considerable of them, which
have occur'd to my thoughts: And I persuade my∣self,
Sir, you will be no more offended with me, for
offering this supplement to your Enquiry, than I
imagine I should myself be with any third person,
who should fix upon others which may have escaped
us both.</P>
<P>You will the more readily excuse the freedom
which I take, as I imagine that the Scenes of our
Lives have been widely different<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">As the Author to whom I write is not certainly known, I take it for granted he is what he seems by his manner of writing, a Gentleman of the Laity: And tho' I have been told since I drew up this letter, he is suppos'd by many to be a young minister in town, I have no evidence of it which is convincing to me: And as I apprehend, it would be ill manners to appear to know him under such a disguise, I thought it not proper to alter what I had writ with regard to the late report.</NOTE>, and consequent∣ly
I may have had an opportunity of making some
useful observations which have not fallen in your
way: Tho' I question not but if you, Sir, had been
in my circumstances, you would soon have re∣mark'd
them; and perhaps have communicated
them to the publick with much greater advantage.</P>
<P>I shall add nothing more by way of introduction,
but that I chuse the title I have prefix'd to these
papers, rather than that of <HI>a farther Enquiry into
the causes of the decay of the Dissenting Interest</HI>; part∣ly,
Sir, as it seem'd most respectful to you, but
principally that I may not appear to advance any
direct charge against any of my brethren in the
process of this discourse. I am sensible that would
be highly indecent on many accounts, and parti∣cularly
as it is from the example of several amongst
them whom I have most intimately known, that I
have learnt many of those particulars of conduct,
which I am now going to offer to your considera∣tion,
as the happiest expedients for the revival of
our common cause.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="6"/>
But before I proceed to particulars, I would ob∣serve
(what we immediately allow, but too quick∣ly
forget) that we are to be concern'd for this in∣terest,
not merely as the cause of a distinct party,
but of truth, honour, and liberty; and I will add,
in a great measure, the cause of serious piety too.
I would be far from confining all true religion to
the members of our own congregations. I am very
well aware that there are a multitude of excellent
persons in the establishment, both amongst the cler∣gy
and the laity, who are (in their different sta∣tions)
burning and shining lights; such as reflect a
glory on the Human Nature, and the Christian
Profession. Yet I apprehend some of these are the
persons who will most readily allow, that, in pro∣portion
to the numbers, there is generally more
practical religion to be found in our assemblies,
than in theirs. This was surely the original, and
this, if I mistake not, must be the support of our
cause. It was not merely a generous sense of li∣berty,
(which may warm the breast of a deist or
an atheist) but a religious reverence for the divine
authority, which animated our pious forefathers,
to so resolute and so expensive an opposition to the
attempts which were made in their day, to invade
the rights of conscience, and the throne of God
its only sovereign. And if the cause be not still
maintain'd on the same principles, I think it will
hardly be worth our while to be much concern'd
about maintaining it at all. It must argue a great
defect, or partiality of thought, for any with the
<HI>Jews</HI> of old to boast of their being free from hu∣man
impositions, when they are <HI>the servants of sin</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John viii. 33, 34.</NOTE>.
And all the world will evidently perceive, that it
is the temper of a Pharisee, rather than of a Chri∣stian,
to contend about <HI>mint, anise</HI> and <HI>cummin,</HI>
(on one side of the question or the other) while
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
there is an apparent indifference about <HI>the weightier
matters of the law</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxiii. 23.</NOTE>. We that are ministers may
entertain ourselves and our hearers with fine ha∣rangues
in defence of liberty; but I apprehend
that in the near views of death and eternity, we
shall have little satisfaction in reflecting on the
converts we have made to that, unless at the same
time we have some reason to hope that they are
persons of true substantial piety; such as will be
our crown in the day of the Lord, and our com∣panions
in the glories of the heavenly world. I
cannot say how trifling and contemptible our la∣bours
appear to me, when consider'd in any other
view. And therefore, Sir, it will be my concern
throughout this whole discourse, to point out those
methods for the support of the Dissenting Interest,
which I imagine will be most subservient to the
cause of practical religion, and vital holiness in all
its branches.</P>
<P>It was the observation of Dr. <HI>Burnet,</HI> almost for∣ty
years ago, in his incomparable discourse on the
Pastoral Care<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cap. viii. p. 204.</NOTE>, "That the Dissenters had then in
a great measure lost that good character for
strictness in religion, which had gain'd them
their credit, and made such numbers fall off to
them." Whether that good character has since
been recover'd, or has not been more and more
declining, some others are more capable of judg∣ing;
but I think it calls for our serious reflection.
And if we find upon enquiry, that this our glory
is departing, it surely deserves to be mention'd, as
one cause, at least, of the decay of our interest:
And that all who sincerely wish well to it, should
express their affection, by exerting themselves with
the utmost zeal, for the revival of practical religion
amongst us.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="8"/>
This must be our common care, according to
the various stations in which Providence has placed
us: And as for ministers, nothing can be more evi∣dent,
than that they, by virtue of their office, are
under peculiar obligations to it. And in order to
pursue it with the greater advantage, I cannot but
think that it should be their concern, TO STUDY
THE CHARACTER AND TEMPER OF THEIR PEOPLE;
that, so far as they can do it with conscience and
honour, they may render themselves agreeable to
them, both in their publick ministrations, and their
private converse.</P>
<P>This, Sir, is so obvious a thought, that one would
imagine it could not be overlook'd or disputed;
yet it is certain our interest has receiv'd conside∣rable
damage for want of a becoming regard to it,
especially in those who have been setting out in the
ministry amongst us. It was therefore, Sir, with
great surprize, that I found you had intirely omit∣ted
it in your late Enquiry, and had dropt some
hints, which (tho' to be sure you did not intend it)
may very probably lead young preachers into a dif∣ferent
and contrary way of thinking, than which
hardly any thing can be more prejudicial, either
to them, or to the cause in which they are imbark'd.</P>
<P>The passage of yours, to which I principally re∣fer,
is in the 33<SUP>d</SUP> and 34<SUP>th</SUP> pages of your <HI>Enquiry</HI>:
where, amongst other things, you observe, that "a
great many of those things that please the people,
have often a very bad tendency in general." And
you add, "the being pleas'd, which they so
much insist upon, seldom arises from any thing
but some oddness that hits their peculiar hu∣mour,
and is not from any view to edification at
all, and therefore too mean to be worthy any
one's study. The people do not usually know
wherein oratory, strength of speech, the art of
persuasion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> consist; and therefore it is vanity
<PB N="9" REF="9"/>
ship; <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Isa. l. 11.</NOTE><HI>they only compass themselves about with sparks of
their own kindling, and shall at last lie down in sorrow.</HI>
And if we be sincere Christians, superficial services
will rob us of that noble pleasure which would attend
a more lively discharge of our duty, and give us a
great deal of perplexity and uneasiness in the review;
so that if we are concerned either for our own safety,
or comfort, it should be our care, that the vigour of
religion be kept up in our hearts.</P>
<P>I would further recommend this, as what is of the
utmost importance to our publick usefulness. It is
probable that our people will imbibe the temper and
spirit which appears in us. This is so obvious a re∣mark,
that it is become a proverb; <NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot">Hos. iv. 9.</NOTE><HI>like people, like
priest.</HI> If we are stupid and unaffected, it will abate
the energy of our addresses, and at once be the cause
and the excuse, of the like languor and insensibility
in them. But if our heart be filled with vital reli∣gion,
it will have a happy influence on all our mini∣strations.
Our prayers and our sermons will be tinc∣tured
with it. <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Mat. xii. 34.</NOTE><HI>Out of the abundance of the heart the
mouth speaketh.</HI> When grace is in exercise within, <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Psal xlv. 2.</NOTE><HI>it
will be poured into our lips,</HI> and <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Luke iv. 22.</NOTE><HI>many gracious words
will proceed from us.</HI> If the <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 9.</NOTE><HI>Holy Ghost dwelleth in
us,</HI> and assists us, we shall lead and guide spiritual
worshippers, in presenting seasonable and proper pe∣titions
to GOD, and the divine warmth and fervency
of our own souls, will be a means to kindle the like
holy fire in theirs: And when we are <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Acts xx. 27.</NOTE><HI>declaring the
counsel of God</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Deut. xxxii. 2.</NOTE>, <HI>our doctrine will drop as the rain, our
speech will distil as the dew, as the small rain on the ten∣der
herb, and as the showers upon the grass</HI>: The con∣solations
designed for those <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Heb. vi. 18.</NOTE><HI>who have fled for refuge
to lay hold upon the hope set before them,</HI> will gently in∣sinuate
themselves into their minds, <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rom. xv. 13.</NOTE><HI>and fill them</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
<HI>with joy and peace in believing.</HI> And if we partake
of that <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">John iii. 34.</NOTE><HI>Spirit</HI> which <HI>God gave without measure to</HI> his
Son, <HI>whom he sent to speak his words,</HI> we shall then
<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Mat. vii. 29.</NOTE><HI>teach with authority</HI>; our instructions will be deli∣vered
with an elevation suitable to our character, and
our people will not only hear, but they will also feel
the weight of our admonitions.</P>
<P>There is something in the performances of some
ministers, which strangely impresses their pious hear∣ers.
Though their discourses be destitute of the or∣naments
of language, yet they <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">John i. 13.</NOTE><HI>who are born of God</HI>
find a sweetness in them, which is incomparably be∣yond
that which ariseth from elegant phrases, and
harmonious periods. That which appears low and
flat to the taste of many, affords the experienced
Christian such an inward and sublime pleasure, as is
not to be found in the highest strains of the most pom∣pous
eloquence. Happy <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. iii. 17.</NOTE><HI>the men of God,</HI> who have
this divine unction which so powerfully attracts de∣vout
souls, whose relish is formed by conversing with
heaven. They are like <HI>Aaron</HI> the high-priest, when
he was consecrated to his office; the holy oil which
was <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ps. cxxxiii. 2.</NOTE><HI>poured on his head,</HI> in so abundant a quantity, <HI>that
it flowed down to the skirts of his garments,</HI> was grateful
to all who were about him: So when these anointed
ones come forth to minister, a sweet perfume, and a
divine fragrancy diffuseth itself through the whole as∣sembly,
and is delightfully perceived, by all those who
<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Heb. v. 14.</NOTE><HI>have their senses spiritually exercised.</HI></P>
<P>The advanced piety of our fathers in the ministry,
did eminently conduce to their remarkable success.
The <HI>Memoirs</HI> which we have of the lives of several
of them, manifest their great attainments in vital and
inward religion; and I fear we shall never recover the
dying interests of Christianity, 'till that be found in
us, which render'd them so signally useful in their ge∣neration.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="11"/>
I have heard it observed by some, who are in a way
of thinking different from us, that our publick ad∣ministrations
are managed with greater propriety and
exactness, than they were in the days of our prede∣cessors.
And without suspicion of flattery, I can
congratulate the rising generation of ministers among
us, with the great improvements they have made, in
the method and style of their performances. But if
the form and order of them is better, I am afraid
the temper of our minds is worse; and since the mi∣nisters
of the last age did so much good with their
unpolished addresses, and we so little with our neater
composures, one would think this might fully con∣vince
us, that <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Mat xvi. 23.</NOTE><HI>a savour of the things that be of God</HI>
is of much greater importance to a minister of the
Gospel, than that politeness which is now so much
admired and affected. It is happy, indeed, when both
these meet in the same person, but instances of this
are very rare. Every pious preacher cannot deliver
himself with elegance and exactness; and accurate
method and beautiful language, are not always ani∣mated
and supported by real devotion. We should
therefore divide our work, and prepare our hearts as
well as lips for the services of the sanctuary, and en∣deavour
after seriousness of spirit, which will more
effectually recommend our labours to enlighten'd
minds, than <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. ii. 4.</NOTE><HI>excellency of speech, or the enticing words
of man's wisdom.</HI></P>
<P>II. We should not only <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. iv. 16.</NOTE><HI>take heed unto ourselves,</HI> but
also <HI>to our doctrine,</HI> that our preaching may have the
most direct tendency to do good.</P>
<P>Upon this head I cannot but advise, that sublime
speculations and abstruse controversies, should not or∣dinarily
be introduced into our sermons. These <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ib. i. 4.</NOTE><HI>mi∣nister
questions rather than godly edifying.</HI> Christianity
<PB N="12" REF="12"/>
is a <HI>doctrine according to godliness, and not a strife about
words.</HI> It is an easy matter to engage our warmer
hearers in disputes on subjects, which neither they, nor
we can fully understand; and the most unfit for such
work, are generally the most forward to enter into it.
I allow, it is the ready way to procure the regards of
those, who lay a mighty stress upon their own opini∣ons,
but their esteem will be purchased at too dear a
rate, since instead of promoting true religion, it will
most certainly destroy it. <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Jam. iii. 16.</NOTE><HI>Where this zeal and con∣tention
is, there is confusion, and every evil work.</HI> Some
may possibly admire it for its shining lustre, but too
fatal experience proves it to be a raging flame and a
devouring fire, and wherever it breaks out, there is
reason to fear, that practical godliness will soon be
consumed. The thoughts and the discourses of
Christians, will be so entirely swallowed up by the
matters in debate, that things of the greatest moment
will be disregarded by them; and their tempers will
be so embitter'd against each other, that charity it∣self,
the <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xiii. 13.</NOTE><HI>greatest</HI> of all graces, will perhaps be counted
a crime.</P>
<P>We live in an age, in which all advantages will be
taken against Christianity: And our pulpit skirmishes
have made sport for unbelievers, and furnished them
with matter for banter and ridicule. By these we have
given them occasion to say, <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Hos. ix. 7.</NOTE><HI>the prophet is a fool, the
spiritual man is mad.</HI> <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">2 Sam. i. 20.</NOTE><HI>Tell it not in Gath, publish it
not in the streets of Askelon, why should the uncircum∣cised,</HI>
the infidels <HI>triumph?</HI> Happy would it be for us,
if those instances of our weakness and folly were bu∣ried
in everlasting oblivion, that they might no more
be mentioned to our disgrace, nor improved to the
prejudice of that excellent religion which we profess.
Let us walk in <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ps. xxvii. 11.</NOTE><HI>a plain path because of our enemies,</HI> and
act the wiser part for the time to come, and employ
<PB N="13" REF="13"/>
our sacred hours, in considering those important sub∣jects,
which cannot be omitted, without the greatest
injury to the souls of our people.</P>
<P>Our first attempts should be to impress their minds,
with a deep and an abiding sense of the pollution
and misery of that estate into which they are fallen
by sin. Here true conversion begins; <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Mat. ix. 12, 13.</NOTE><HI>the whole
need not the physician, but those who are sick,</HI> and Christ
<HI>did not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repen∣tance.</HI>
Men will never be concerned about the reno∣vation
of their natures, 'till they see the depravity of
them; neither will they <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">iii. 7.</NOTE><HI>flee from the wrath which is
to come,</HI> unless they apprehend they are <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 19.</NOTE><HI>become guilty
before God,</HI> and so exposed to it.</P>
<P>This, by the blessing of GOD, will engage them to
<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Acts xvi. 30.</NOTE><HI>cry out, What shall we do to be saved?</HI> and dispose
them to receive the <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Luke ii. 10.</NOTE><HI>good tidings of great joy,</HI> which
the Gospel <HI>brings.</HI> Convinced sinners will rejoice to
hear of a Saviour, and therefore we should <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Acts xvii. 18.</NOTE><HI>preach
to them Jesus,</HI> and make <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. ii. 14.</NOTE><HI>manifest the savour of the
knowledge of him,</HI> <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">John xvii. 3.</NOTE><HI>whom to know is life eternal.</HI> This
will lead us to consider the dignity of his person as
the <HI>Son of God,</HI> and those several offices which he
sustains, as the prophet, the priest, and the king of
his church. Here we shall have occasion to treat of
his mysterious incarnation, his holy life, his divine
doctrine, his wonderful miracles, his painful and ac∣cursed
death, his resurrection and ascension into hea∣ven,
his exaltation to the right-hand of GOD, and
his glorious appearance to the universal judgment.
These arguments should be frequently and largely
insisted upon, because they are the distinguishing ar∣ticles
of the Christian revelation, and if they are not
of high importance, that revelation was given us in
vain.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="14"/>
Having proposed to lost sinners that <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Heb. ix. 12.</NOTE><HI>redemption
which the blessed Jesus hath obtained,</HI> we should then
acquaint them with the method in which it is applied
by the Holy Ghost. This will bring us to open the
nature of faith, repentance, and effectual calling,
and to shew in what manner they are wrought. An
account of these may be useful to all sorts of hearers,
the unregenerate sinner may thereby be convinced
that he is destitute of them, and this may put him
upon fervent prayer, and constant endeavours after
an acquaintance with them: And sincere Christians
will be wonderfully confirmed and comforted, by dis∣courses
on these mysteries of the <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Luke xvii. 21.</NOTE><HI>kingdom of God with∣in
us,</HI> because they will be only a transcript of that
original draught of them, which is more fairly in∣scribed
upon their hearts, by the sacred Spirit himself.
It is an excellent attainment in a minister, to be able
to handle these subjects clearly and distinctly; and
nothing will conduce more to this, than a strict ob∣servation
of the various turns and movements of the
soul, and an experience of them in ourselves; for as
<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxvii. 19.</NOTE><HI>in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man
to man.</HI></P>
<P>The privileges of true believers do likewise deserve
our very attentive regards. These are many and va∣luable
too; they are <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Eph. i. 3.</NOTE><HI>blessed with all spiritual blessings
in Christ,</HI> and it is fit they should know what they
are, that they may rejoice in them. The apostle
<HI>Paul</HI> hath left us several excellent discourses on these
heads, which should greatly recommend them to all
Christian ministers, who desire to form themselves on
so compleat a model.</P>
<P>Neither should we neglect the various exercises and
trials, which the servants of GOD are exposed to in
this life. These proceed from different causes, and
will require a distinct and particular consideration, if
<PB N="15" REF="15"/>
we would assist them in their way to heaven. It is a
necessary and useful part of our work, <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. i. 4.</NOTE><HI>to comfort
them who are in trouble,</HI> and to say <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Is. xxxv. 4.</NOTE><HI>unto them who
are of a fearful heart, be strong.</HI> We should always
be ready, <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">l. 4.</NOTE><HI>to speak a word in season to him that is
weary</HI>; these stand in peculiar need of our assistance,
and we shall be very defective in our duty, if we
do not give it them, in the most kind and tender
manner.</P>
<P>I add, that we must <HI>constantly</HI> and earnestly <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Tit. iii. 8.</NOTE><HI>affirm,</HI>
<HI>that they which have believed in God, might be careful
to maintain good works.</HI> The great duties of the Christi∣an
life must be particularly drawn out, and press'd,
that <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">ii. 10.</NOTE><HI>the doctrine of God our Saviour may in all things
be adorned,</HI> by a becoming conversation. And if we
would acquit ourselves as <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. iii. 6.</NOTE><HI>ministers of the New Testa∣ment,</HI>
and manage our practical discourses in a way
suitable to the Gospel dispensation, we must direct
men to those assistances which are promised, and to
those animating motives which are proposed there, to
enable and incline them, to purify themselves from
the pollutions <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">vii. 1.</NOTE><HI>of the flesh and of the spirit, and to
perfect holiness in the fear of God.</HI> Nothing will be
done without divine influences, and there are no ar∣guments
so forcible as those which are taken from
evangelical considerations; and if these are omitted,
we shall treat on moral subjects with less propriety and
spirit, than many heathens have done.</P>
<P>These are some of those weighty subjects, which
we should handle at large in the course of our preach∣ing.
And in the management of them, we ought al∣ways
in the first place to consult <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 2.</NOTE><HI>the oracles of God.</HI>
There is an admirable fulness and sufficiency in the

and for instruction in righteousness</HI>; they will
<PB N="16" REF="16"/>
furnish us with the most solid and popular thoughts,
to illustrate, confirm, and enforce the arguments we
are upon. If we will be at the pains to collect out
of the inspired Volume, the hints which are given on
any topic, we shall be surprised to find, how well
they are adapted, to render the <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. iii. 17.</NOTE><HI>man of God perfect,
throughly furnished unto all good works.</HI> In the forming
of our discourses, we should attend more to <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. ii. 13.</NOTE><HI>that
which the Holy Ghost teacheth, comparing spiritual things
with spiritual,</HI> and then our sermons would be more
compleat, and much more edifying than they gene∣rally
are.</P>
<P>It is certainly of great importance, that we should
be well acquainted with the contents, and with the
sense of the sacred writings. We should frequently
read them, diligently study them, and as we have
opportunity, we should expound them in our families,
and in our congregations: If this be our constant
practice, we may then hope, that we shall be <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Mat. xiii. 52.</NOTE><HI>as
scribes instructed unto the kingdom of heaven, bringing
forth out of our treasures things new and old.</HI></P>
<P>Nor would I have the writings of other wise and
good men entirely laid aside; I could rather wish,
that the use of some of them, which are much neg∣lected,
might be revived. I particularly refer to the
works of some of the <HI>old Puritans,</HI> and of the Divines
of the last age. I own myself an admirer of them,
and have often thought it a great mercy, that there
are so many of them in the hands of the common peo∣ple,
to supply what is deficient in our more fashiona∣ble
instructions. I allow that the style of those ex∣cellent
men is sometimes heavy, their diction low,
and their method not the most easy or just; but their
thoughts are weighty, their matter substantial, and
their discourses spiritual and affecting. I once asked
a very <HI>popular preacher,</HI> (who filled a considerable
post amongst us, with great reputation and usefulness)
<PB N="17" REF="17"/>
a thousand arguments concurring to inspire us
with a sort of paternal tenderness for the souls of
the meanest of our people. This will teach us
to bear with their prejudices, to accommodate
ourselves to their weakness; and to consider it as
a mixture of impiety and cruelty, to neglect num∣bers
of them, out of complaisance to the taste of
a few, who are perhaps some of them but occa∣sional
visitants, and whom we judge by their ha∣bits,
rather than by any personal acquaintance, to
be a part of the polite world.</P>
<P>Did I affect to throw together all that might be
said on this subject, I might both illustrate and
confirm what I have already written, by shewing
at large, that Christianity is a religion originally
calculated for the plainer part of mankind, by that
God who <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. i. 27.</NOTE><HI>has chosen the foolish things of the world
to confound the wise, and the weak things of the world
to confound the things which are mighty</HI>; and conse∣quently
that a neglect and contempt of the com∣mon
people, is far from being the spirit of the
gospel. I might add many remarks to this pur∣pose
on the preaching and conduct of St. <HI>Paul,</HI>
and fill whole pages with quotations from him and
the rest of the Apostles, and many more from
some of the most ancient and celebrated Fathers
of the Church. But I do not think it necessary
for the support of my argument, and I am per∣suaded
that you, Sir, in particular, have no need
of being taught these things from me.</P>
<P>Permit me only to add, (what you must fre∣quently
have observ'd) that our <HI>Lord Jesus Christ</HI>
is a most amiable and wonderful example of a
plain, familiar, and popular preacher. When we
come to peruse those divine discourses, which ex∣torted
a confession from his very enemies that he
<PB N="18" REF="18"/>
spake as never man spake, we find neither a long
train of abstract reasonings, nor a succession of
labour'd periods, adorn'd with an artificial exact∣ness;
but the most solid and important sense, de∣liver'd
in an easy and natural way, illustrated
by similies taken from the most common objects
in life, and enforced with lively figures, and the
strongest energy of expression; which is well con∣sistent
with all the former. So that upon the
whole it was most happily calculated, at once to
instruct the most ignorant, and to awaken the
most negligent hearer. I cannot but wish that
some judicious writer would attempt to set this
part of our Lord's character in a clearer and a
more particular light; and would shew us how
the whole of his conduct, as well as the manner
of his address, was calculated to promote his use∣fulness
under the character of a preacher of
righteousness. I hope such an essay might be very
serviceable to those of us, who have the honour
to succeed him in that part of his work; and I
persuade myself that it would furnish us with a
variety of beautiful remarks on many passages in
the evangelical historians, which are not to be
found in the most celebrated commentators.</P>
<P>You will excuse me, Sir, for having insisted so
largely on the necessity of endeavouring to render
ourselves agreeable to our people; because I am
fully persuaded, that it is of great importance to
the support and revival of the Dissenting Interest.
I hope you already apprehend that I intend no∣thing
in this advice, which is below the pursuit of
the most elevated genius, or the most generous
temper; nothing inconsistent with the politeness
of the gentleman and the scholar, or the dignity
of the christian and the minister. You cannot
imagine that I would recommend a popularity
<PB N="19" REF="19"/>
rais'd by quirks and jingles, or sounded on af∣fected
tones, or ridiculous grimaces; and much less
on an attempt to inflame the passions of mankind
about trifling controversies, and the peculiar un∣scriptural
phrases of a party. Such a popularity
as this, is almost the only thing that is more de∣spicable,
than the insolent pride of despising the
people.</P>
<P>If any of my younger brethren were to en∣quire
how another popularity, of a far more ho∣nourable
kind, is to be pursued and secured, I
answer, that their own converse and observation
on the world, must furnish them with the most
valuable instructions on this head. And tho' some
of their particular remarks may differ, according
to the various places and circumstances in which
they are made; yet I apprehend there are many
things of considerable importance, in which they
will all agree. As for instance:</P>
<P>They will quickly see that the generality of
the Dissenters, who appear to be persons of se∣rious
piety, have been deeply impress'd with the
peculiarities of the gospel-scheme. They have
felt the divine energy of those important doctrines,
to awaken, and revive, and enlarge the soul; and
therefore they will have a peculiar relish for dis∣courses
upon them. So that if a man should ge∣nerally
confine himself to subjects of natural re∣ligion,
and moral virtue, and seldom fix on the doc∣trines
of Christ, and the spirit, and then perhaps
treat them with such caution, that he might seem
rather to be making concessions to an adversary,
than giving vent to the fulness of his heart on its
darling subject, he would soon find, that all the
penetration and eloquence of an angel, could not
make him universally agreeable to our assem∣blies.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="20"/>
Many of our people have pass'd thro' a variety
of exercises in their minds, relating to the great
concern of eternal salvation. And they apprehend
that the scripture teaches us to ascribe this com∣bat
to the agency of satan, and the corruptions of
our own heart on the one hand, and the opera∣tions
of the holy spirit of God on the other. It
is therefore very agreeable to them, to hear these
experimental subjects handled with seriousness
and tenderness. It raises their veneration for
such a minister, as for one who has himself tasted
of the grace of God, and encourages their con∣fidence
in him, and their expectations of impro∣ving
by his labours. On the other hand, it
grieves them when these subjects are much ne∣glected,
and gives them the most formidable sus∣picions
if one word be dropt which seems to pour
contempt upon them, as if they were all fancy
and enthusiasm; (with which, it must be granted,
they are sometimes mix'd.)</P>
<P>The greater part of most dissenting congrega∣tions
consisting (as we before observ'd) of plain
people, who have not enjoy'd the advantages of a
learned education, nor had leisure for improve∣ments
by after-study, it is apparently necessary
that a man should speak <HI>plainly</HI> to them, if he de∣sire
they should understand and approve what he
says. And as for those that are truly religious,
they attend on publick worship, not that they
may be amused with a form or a sound, nor en∣tertain'd
with some new and curious speculation;
but that their hearts may be enlarged as in the
presence of God, that they may be powerfully
affected with those great things of religion, which
they already know and believe, that so their con∣duct
may be suitably influenced by them. And
to this purpose they desire that their ministers
<PB N="21" REF="21"/>
may speak as if they were in earnest, in a <HI>lively</HI>
and <HI>pathetick,</HI> as well as a clear and intelligible
manner.</P>
<P>Such is the taste of the generality of the dis∣senters;
a taste which I apprehend they will still
retain, whatever attempts may be made to alter
it. And I must take the liberty to say, that I
conceive this turn of thought in the people to be
the great support of our interest, and not the
little scruples which you hint at in the 34<SUP>th</SUP> page of
your Letter, nor even those rational and generous
principles of liberty, which you so clearly pro∣pose,
and so strenuously assert. And I cannot
but believe, that if the established clergy, and
the dissenting ministers in general, were mutual∣ly
to exchange their strain of preaching, and their
manner of living but for one year, it would be
the ruin of our cause, even though there should
be no alteration in the constitution and discipline
of the church of <HI>England.</HI> However you might
fare at <HI>London,</HI> or in some very singular cases
elsewhere, I can hardly imagine that there
would be dissenters enough left in some consi∣derable
counties, to fill one of our largest meet∣ing-places.</P>
<P>We have then advanced thus far; that he who
would be generally agreeable to dissenters, must
be an evangelical, an experimental, a plain and
an affectionate preacher. Now I must do our
common people the justice to own, that when
these points are secured, they are not very
delicate in their demands, with regard to the
forms of a discourse. They will not in such a
case be very much disgusted, though there be no
regular charm of reasoning, no remarkable pro∣priety
of thought or of expression, no elegance
of language, and but little decency of address.
<PB N="22" REF="22"/>
The want of all these is forgiven, to what they
apprehend of much greater importance. Yet, Sir,
I would not from hence inser, that these things
are to be neglected; on the contrary, I appre∣hend
it is absolutely necessary, that they should
be diligently attended to, in order to obtain that
universal popularity, which I think so desirable
for the sake of more extensive usefulness. A
man of a good taste will certainly take some care
about them. 'Tis what he owes to himself, and
to the politer part of his audience, whom he
will never be willing to lose in the crowd: And
he need not fear that a prudent regard to them,
will spoil his acceptance with the people. Few
of them like a discourse the worse for being
thoroughly good; and the accomplished orator
will find, perhaps to his surprize, that they will
not only know and feel the important truths of
religion, in the most agreeable dress he can give
them, but that they will even applaud the order
and regularity of his composures, the beauty of his
language, and the gracefulness of his delivery,
at the same time that they have the candour
not to complain of the indigested rovings, the
unnatural transports, and the awkward distor∣tions
of the pious well-meaning, but injudicious
preacher. For human nature is so formed, that
some manners of thinking and speaking are uni∣versally
agreeable and delightful. 'Tis the per∣fection
of eloquence to be master of these, and
should, I think, be the care of every one that
speaks in publick, to pursue them as far as ge∣nius
and opportunity will allow<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This is that regard to the <HI>SENSUS COMMUNIS,</HI> which <HI>Tully</HI> thinks so necessary.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="23"/>
The man who forms himself upon such views
as these, if he be not remarkably deficient in
natural capacities, will probably be popular a∣mongst
the dissenters <HI>as a Preacher</HI>: But a think∣ing
man will easily perceive this is not the only
character under which a minister is considered.
His people will naturally and reasonably expect a
<HI>Conduct</HI> answerable to his publick discourses; and
without it, he cannot be thoroughly agreeable to
them. They will take it for granted, that a
man so well acquainted with divine truths, and
one that seems to be so deeply affected with
them, should be regular and exemplary in the
whole of his behaviour, and free from the taint
of vice, or of folly, in any remarkable degree.
They will expect that he should be far from
being a slave to secular interest, or to the little
trifles of food, dress, or domestick accommoda∣tion;
and that he should avoid every thing
haughty and overbearing, or peevish and fretful
in his daily converse. They will conclude, that
a desire of doing good to souls, will make him
easy of access to those who apply to him for
advice, with regard to their spiritual concern∣ments;
and that it will likewise dispose him at
proper times to visit all the people of his charge,
the poor as well as the rich; and that not only
under the character of a friend, but of a mi∣nister,
in a direct view to their spiritual edifi∣cation.
And if a man desire the affections of his
people, he must not disappoint such expectations
as these.</P>
<P>The tenderness with which parents interest
themselves in the concerns of their children, and
the earnest desire that all religious parents must
necessarily have, that theirs may be <HI>a seed to serve
the Lord,</HI> will engage them very kindly to accept
<PB N="24" REF="24"/>
our care, in attempting to bring them under early
impressions of serious piety. Catechising has there∣fore
been generally found a very popular, as well as
a very useful practice. And here I think it is much
to be wish'd that our labour may extend to the
youth, as well as to little children; that in a fa∣miliar
way they may be methodically acquainted
with the principles of natural religion, and then
with the evidences of the truth of Christianity,
and with the nature of it, as it is exhibited in
the New Testament; both with regard to the
privileges and the duties of christians. As this
might be a means of filling our churches with a
considerable number of rational, catholick, and
pious communicants, from whom considerable
usefulness might in time be expected, so it would
greatly oblige their religious parents, and lay a
foundation for a growing friendship between us,
and our catechumens, in the advance of life.</P>
<P>I once thought to have insisted more largely on
these hints, but am happily prevented by the pub∣lication
of Mr. <HI>Some's</HI> Sermon, on the methods to
be taken by ministers for the revival of religion.
He has fully spoken my sentiments, with regard
to many of those articles on which I have only
glanc'd. I persuade my self, Sir, you will read it
with a great deal of pleasure; for (so far as I
can judge) this sermon is almost as agreeable an
example of that preaching, as his life is of that
conduct, which he recommends. I am confident
that a man of your good sense must necessarily
approve the scheme which I have briefly laid down,
and which is there largely consider'd and recom∣mended.
Were you to chuse a Pastor for your
self, I doubt not but you would rejoice in such
a one; and you would probably have the hearty
concurrence of the weakest and most illiterate of
<PB N="25" REF="25"/>
your pious neighbours. My younger brethren
(for whom alone I am now presuming to write)
can have no reason to complain, that I have as∣signed
them either a mean, or a severe task. I
heartily desire to be their companion in all the
most laborious, and self-denying parts of it; and
I persuade my self, that we shall find it, on the
whole, as delightful as honourable, and as advan∣tageous
to our selves, as it will be serviceable to
the publick interest.</P>
<P>There seems to be but one material objection
against all this; and it is an objection, in which,
I doubt not, but your own thoughts have already
prevented me. It may perhaps be pleaded, that
we have a sort of people amongst us, whose appro∣bation
and esteem cannot be obtain'd by such
honourable methods as I propos'd. For they,
whom we call the <HI>rigidly orthodox,</HI> are so devoted
to a peculiar sett of human phrases, which have
been introduc'd into the explication of some im∣portant
doctrines, that they will hardly entertain
a favourable thought of any who scruple the use
of them, or who do not seem to value them as
highly as they, tho' they may, on all other ac∣counts,
be ever so considerable.</P>
<P>You, Sir, hint at <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 44.</NOTE> a very expeditious remedy for
uneasiness arising from this quarter; that persons
of generous and bigotted sentiments, should meet
in different places. In <HI>London</HI> it is certainly practi∣cable,
and may perhaps be most expedient; but
to attempt any such separation in the country,
would be the utter ruin of many of our societies,
which now make some considerable appearance.
But besides my regard to the ministers and societies
to which they are related, I must confess, I have
<PB N="26" REF="26"/>
too much tenderness for the persons themselves, to
be willing intirely to give them up. I have been
intimately acquainted with those who have been
accus'd, and perhaps not unjustly, of this unhappy
attachment to human phrases, and nicety in con∣troversial
points; and I must do many of them the
justice to own, that I have found very excellent
qualities mingled with this excess of zeal, (which
must methinks appear pardonable in them, when
we consider how artificially it has been infus'd;
and how innocently they have receiv'd and retain'd
it, from a real principle of conscience to God.)
But, indulging them in this one article, several of
them will appear to be persons of so much humi∣lity
and piety, of so much integrity and generosity,
of so much activity and zeal for the common in∣terest,
that separate from all views to private ad∣vantage
or reputation, one would heartily wish to
do all he honestly can, to remove those prejudices,
which give them so much uneasiness, and impair
the lustre of so many virtues and graces. And
if at the same time we can secure their esteem and
friendship, it may have such an influence, both on
our own comfort and usefulness in life, that it
must be great ignorance or pride to despise it.</P>
<P>You will readily grant, Sir, that the thing is in
it self desirable: The great question is, how it
may be effected? And here I will venture to say
freely, that I apprehend bigotry of all kinds, to
be a fortress, which may be attack'd by sap more
successfully than by storm. It is evident that we
have most of us something of the humour of
children, that grasp a thing so much the more
eagerly, when an attempt is made to wrest it out
of their hands by violence; and yet perhaps will
drop it themselves in a few minutes, if you can
but divert their attention to something else.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="27"/>
From such a view of things, I apprehend, we
are to judge of the most proper methods of deal∣ing
with those, whose case is now under conside∣ration.
You, Sir, may tell them again, and again,
with your natural coolness and moderation, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Enquiry, p. 34, 37.</NOTE><HI>That
it would be an instance of their modesty to resign their
pleasures to the general notions and judgment—that
instead of assuming the characters of judges and censors,
they should put on the humble temper of learners—
and receive the truth without being jealous of heresy
in our younger preachers—</HI>And at the same time,
that you are thus giving your advice, you may
give your reasons, as clearly and handsomely, as you
have given them for Nonconformity in this Enqui∣ry;
yet after all, you will probably find, that the
<HI>Civium Ardor</HI> PRAVA JUBENTIUM will
out-noise the voice of the charmer, charming ever
so wisely. And should I exert my self with greater
warmth and eagerness, should I grow a bigot in
the defence of catholicism, and load those of diffe∣rent
sentiments with reproaches, because they
have profited no better by so many solid argu∣ments;
I should indeed pay a very great compli∣ment
to them, in supposing them capable of know∣ing,
and admitting truth, under so disagreeable a
disguise; but it would be at the expence of my
own character and ease, and I should run the risk
of being severely scorch'd by that flame, which I
pretended to extinguish, by pouring on oil.</P>
<P>I cannot but think it much more adviseable, ac∣cording
to the Apostle's maxim of <HI>becoming all
things to all men,</HI> to study to accommodate our
selves in this respect, as well as in others, to the
infirmities of our hearers, as far as with a safe
conscience we may. If we can put a tolerably
<PB N="28" REF="28"/>
good sense on any of their favourite phrases, it
would surely be a most unreasonable stiffness and
perverseness of temper, to avoid it merely because
they admire it. Or if we cannot go so far, we
may at least lay aside any darling phrases of our
own, which we know will be offensive to them.
(For if the Bible be a compleat rule, <HI>our</HI> human
forms are no more necessary than <HI>theirs.</HI>) Christians
as such profess a reverence for the Scripture, and
many of these christians have a distinguishing re∣gard
to it, as they have felt its divine energy on
their souls. Now, Sir, with submission to the
better judgment of my brethren, I think we,
who are Ministers, should take them by the handle,
and should labour to discover to them, more and
more, the beauty and fulness of the word of God,
not only with regard to this or that particular
doctrine, but to the whole system of truth and
duty contain'd in it. 'Tis a subject on which we
might speak, and they would hear with pleasure;
and it would not only divert their attention, and
their zeal from other things, which might give
uneasiness, but would have a direct tendency to
enlarge their views, and sweeten their tempers,
beyond all our encomiums on liberty and catho∣licism,
or our satyrs on bigotry and imposition.</P>
<P>I likewise apprehend, that a regard to what
was said under the former heads, will farther
conduce to this happy end. When these exact
people hear us preaching in a truly spiritual and
experimental strain, and at the same time in such
a rational and graceful manner, as may set our
discourses above contempt, and make them agree∣able
to the younger and politer part of our au∣ditory,
as well as to others; they will quickly see
that it is not for their own interest, or that of
their children, to drive us away with a rigorous
<PB N="29" REF="29"/>
severity. And therefore, instead of studying to
find us hereticks, they will rather put the most
favourable sense on ambiguous expressions, and
labour to believe us as orthodox as they can:
Or, if they suspect us to be in the dark as to
some particulars, yet they will charitably hope,
that age and experience will perfect what is
wanting; and that <HI>God will reveal it to us</HI> in his
own time. With these views they will chearfully
commit themselves to our ministerial care, if pro∣vidence
seems to open a way for our settlement a∣mongst
them. And when they find, that they are
handsomely treated by us, that no direct attack is
made upon their darling notions; but that the
great concerns of practical religion (as dear to
them as to any people upon earth) are plainly
and faithfully pursued by us, both in publick and
private (to the refreshment of their own souls,
and to the evident advantage of many others)
they will contract a tender, growing affection for
us: And thus their bigotry will gradually wear
away, till perhaps they come at last joyfully to
embrace those more generous notions, from which
they would at first have started back with hor∣ror.</P>
<P>Thus we may, after the example of our great
master, teach our followers, as they are able to
bear it: And by this moderation, may be instrumen∣tal
in healing the breaches which we profess to la∣ment,
in rescuing many an excellent soul from
a painful and dishonourable bondage; and in
spreading a generous, candid, christian spirit,
which will be the glory and happiness of our
Interest in general, as well as of the particular
societies under our care. And in the mean time
another generation will be rising, whom we may
hope to form, in a manner agreeable to our
<PB N="30" REF="30"/>
own sentiments, who may transmit to remote
ages, those united principles of piety and ca∣tholicism,
which they have happily learnt from
us.</P>
<P>I cannot but think, that such rational and no∣ble
prospects may encourage us to submit to some
restraints, which we should not otherwise have
chose. But if, after all, we inflexibly insist on
"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 37.</NOTE><HI>as unbounded a liberty of speaking our sentiments
in publick, as of forming them in private,</HI>" or in
the language of <HI>Solomon, of uttering all our mind,</HI>
I think we shall dearly purchase the pleasure of
hearing our selves talk, on a subject on which we
can do little more, than echo back a part of what
has been so copiously and judiciously written, and
so frequently repeated by others. The wiser part
of mankind will look upon us as forward heirs,
who spend our estate of reputation and impor∣tance
in life, before we come to it; and upon the
whole, we shall not only exceedingly injure our
selves in private life, which is comparatively but a
trifle, but shall impair our future usefulness, and
even wound the darling cause of liberty, to which
we are so ready to sacrifice all. For I seriously
declare, that if I could be so wicked as to form a
design against it, and so base as to prosecure it by
clandestine and hypocritical methods, I would only
set my self to declaim in its favour, with impru∣dent
zeal, and unbounded fury.</P>
<P>You have now, Sir, all that I think it proper to
say, at present, concerning the methods by which
I apprehend those of us, who are imploy'd in the
ministry, may most effectually contribute to the
revival of the Dissenting Interest. I can assure
you, they are not the reveries of my own closet,
<PB N="31" REF="31"/>
but observations which I have drawn from life, as
occasions have occur'd in conversing with a variety
of persons, of different stations, relishes, and cha∣racters.
I have the better opinion of many of them,
as I know that they are thoroughly agreeable to
the sentiments and conduct of some of the most
considerable persons of all denominations amongst
us, both in town and country; whose friendship
is the honour and pleasure of my life. I am par∣ticularly
confirm'd in this way of thinking, by ob∣serving
the success which such measures have had
in the congregations of my fathers and brethren in
these parts. For I know, that in many of them,
the number of Dissenters is greatly increas'd
within these twenty years; and the interest con∣tinues
so to flourish, that I am confident some of
our honest people, who converse only in their own
neighbourhood, will be surpriz'd to hear of <HI>an En∣quiry
into the causes of its decay.</HI></P>
<P>If what I have writ appear reasonable to you,
Sir, I cannot but wish that you, and other gentle∣men
of the laity, who are heartily concern'd for
our interest, would endeavour to cultivate such
sentiments as these in the minds of young ministers
of your acquaintance. We are naturally very
desirous of being known to you, and singled out
as the object of your regard. Whereas we early
begin to look with a comparative contempt upon
the meaner sort of people, as an ignoble Herd—
<HI>Fruges consumere nati—</HI> Whilst engag'd in our
preparatory studies, we are indeed so generous,
as to give up one another to the vulgar; but we
have each of us the penetration to discover, that
there is something uncommon in our dear selves,
by which nature seems to have intended us to be
(as we absurdly enough express it) orators for
the polite. These arrogant and pernicious sen∣timents
<PB N="32" REF="32"/>
we sometimes carry along with us, from
the academy to the pulpit; where perhaps, we
make our first appearance infinitely solicitous
about every trifling circumstance of a discourse,
yet negligent of that which should be the soul of
it. And if the people are not as much charm'd
with it as ourselves, we have then an evident
demonstration of their incorrigible stupidity; and
so resentment concurs with pride and ambition,
to set us at the remotest distance from those, who
ought to be the objects of our tenderest re∣gards.</P>
<P>If an elder minister have so much compassion
and generosity, as to deal freely with us upon
these heads, and give us such advice as cir∣cumstances
require, 'tis great odds but we find
some excuse for neglecting what he says—
"He is ignorant and unpolite; or perhaps in∣toxicated
with his own popularity, and means
his counsels to us as encomiums upon him∣self."—Or
if neither of these will do,
some other artifice must be found out, to fix
the blame any where rather than at home. And
if in the midst of a thousand mortifications, we
can but find out one gentleman of fortune, sense,
and learning, that admires us, we are happy.
A single diamond is worth more than a whole
load of pebbles; and we perhaps adapt, with
vast satisfaction, the celebrated words of <HI>Arbuscula</HI>
in <HI>Horace</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hor. Sat. Lib. I. x. v. 78, &amp;c.</NOTE>,
<Q>Men' moveat Cimex Pantilius, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
Without considering that what was highly pro∣per
in the mouth of a player, and a poet, would
<PB N="33" REF="33"/>
be extremely absurd in a Heathen, and much
more in a Christian Orator.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, what I intend by all this, is
to shew that you gentlemen may have it in
your power to do a great deal to correct
these mistaken notions. If we plainly see that
you regard us, not merely according to the
manner in which our performances are ac∣commodated
to your own private taste, but
according to our desire and capacity of be∣ing
useful to the publick interest, we shall
perhaps be taught to place our point of ho∣nour
right; and when that is once done,
a moderate degree of genius, application, and
prudence, may be sufficient, by the blessing of
God, to secure the rest.</P>
<P>I would here, Sir, have ended my Letter,
but the hints you give in the conclusion of
yours concerning <HI>Academical Education,</HI> lead me
to add a few words on that head. I would
be far from the insolence of pretending to
teach tutors; but I apprehend that if my for∣mer
principles be allow'd, it will follow, by
the easiest consequence in the world, that it
is a very important part of their business, to
form their pupils to a regard for the people,
and to a manner of preaching, and of converse,
which may be agreeable to them.</P>
<P>There is hardly any thing which should be
more discouraged in a young student, than
such a mistaken haughty way of thinking, as I
so freely described a little above, especially when
it discovers itself in a petulant inclination to
employ their talent at satyr, in ridiculing the
infirmities of plain serious Christians, or the
labours of those ministers, who are willing to
<PB N="34" REF="34"/>
condescend to the meanest capacities, that they
may be wise to win souls.</P>
<P>A young man of sense will easily enter into
such plain reasonings as I have offered in the
beginning of this Letter, and be convinced by
them, that if he ever appear under the cha∣racter
of a dissenting minister, he must not
neglect the people. But it is greatly to be
desired, that our students may be engaged to
regard them, not merely from political, but re∣ligious
views.</P>
<P>It is therefore, no doubt, the care of every
pious tutor amongst us, (and may God make
it a more constant and successful care) to pos∣sess
his pupils, who are design'd for the mi∣nistry,
with a deep and early sense of the im∣portance
of the gospel-scheme, for the reco∣very
of man from the ruins of the apostacy,
and his restoration to God, and happiness by
a mediator.—To shew (as it may easily be
shewn) that this has been the great end of
the divine counsels, with regard to which, the
harmony of nature in the lower world has
been supported, and the various oeconomies of
providence disposed:—To point out the
Son of God descending from heaven in favour
of this design, pursuing it by humble conde∣scensions
for the lowest of the people, and un∣wearied
labours amongst them; and at last,
establishing it by agonies and death:—To
shew them the Apostles taking up their ma∣ster's
cause, prosecuting it with unwearied vi∣gour
and resolution, and sacrificing to it their
ease, their reputation, their liberty, and their
lives:—To trace out those generous e∣motions
of soul, which still live and breathe
in their immortal writings:—And then
<PB N="35" REF="35"/>
(when their minds are warmed with such a
survey) to apply to the students themselves,
as persons designed by Providence, to engage
in the same work, to support and carry on
the same interest, who therefore must be
acted by the same views, and imbibe the same
spirit.</P>
<P>Something of this kind is, I doubt not, at∣tended
to; and I must take the liberty to say,
that I think these the most important lectures
a tutor can read. You cannot but see, Sir,
that by the blessing of God, such addresses
must have an apparent tendency to fill the
mind with sublime and elevated views, and to
make a man feel and own too, (though it may
appear something unpolite) that the salvation of
one soul, is of infinitely greater importance,
than charming a thousand splendid assemblies,
with the most elegant discourses that were ever
delivered. A young minister under these im∣pressions,
will come out to his publick work
<HI>naturally disposed to care for the state of his peo∣ple</HI>;
and such sincere zeal and tenderness will
form him to a popular address, abundantly
sooner, and more happily, than the most judi∣cious
rules which it is possible to dictate.</P>
<P>As examples are the best illustration of pre∣cepts,
it must certainly be a great advantage
to pupils to hear such preaching, and see such
pastoral care, as is recommended to them in
the lecture-room. A prudent man, who is con∣cerned
in the education of young ministers,
will be particularly careful to avoid those faults
in preaching, which they are in the greatest
danger of falling into; and particularly too ab∣stracted
a train of reasoning, and too great a
care about the little ornaments of speech, when
<PB N="36" REF="36"/>
addressing to a common auditory. And if
(where other circumstances may allow it) he
sometimes engage the attendance of senior pu∣pils
in his pastoral visits, and introduce them
to the acquaintance and freedom of some se∣rious
Christians in the society, it may be much
for their improvement. A more intimate know∣ledge
of their hidden worth, and perhaps of
those noble traces of natural genius, which
they might discover amongst some of a very
low education, would something increase their
esteem for the populace in general. And from
their observations on books and sermons,
and their accounts of the various exercises of
their minds, (where our politer hearers are
generally more reserv'd) a man may best learn
how they are to be address'd, and form him∣self
to that experimental strain, on which so
much of his acceptance and usefulness amongst
us will depend.</P>
<P>If you apprehend, Sir, that such a course
will make them preachers for the vulgar, <HI>and
for them only</HI>; I think it sufficient to answer,
that I intirely agree with you in what you say
of the great advantages of an intimate ac∣quaintance
with the learned languages, and
the classical writers both of the <HI>Romans</HI> and
<HI>Greeks.</HI> I heartily wish our students may al∣ways
be well furnished with it before they
leave the schools, and think it highly proper
it should be carried on through the whole of
their academical course. And I cannot ima∣gine,
that a man of tolerable sense, who is
every day conversing with some of the finest
writers of antiquity, and who is (as most of
our students are) a little exercised in the ma∣thematical
sciences, (to teach him attention of
<PB N="37" REF="37"/>
thought, and strength, and perspicuity of rea∣soning)
will be in great danger of saying any
thing remarkably impertinent, or contemptibly
low.</P>
<P>As for being masters of our own language,
'tis a point which I think should be thorough∣ly
labour'd from the very beginning of their
education. They should to be sure make them∣selves
familiarly acquainted with those writers,
which are allowed to be the standards of it,
and should frequently be translating and com∣posing.
And if this be not only practised at
school, but continued through four or five
years of academical education, they will have
formed a habit of expressing themselves grace∣fully,
or at least tolerably well: So that in
their ordinary composures, when they have
digested their materials, and ranged their
thoughts, they will often find proper, expressive,
and elegant words, flowing in faster than they
can write them.</P>
<P>And as composition is far from being the
only business of an orator; so I heartily wish,
that not only tutors, but school-masters (whose
character and conduct, by the way, is of
vast importance to our interest) would make
a very serious business of teaching lads, who
are design'd for the ministry, to read well,
and to pronounce properly and handsomely.
Thus an early remedy would be provided
on the one hand, against those unnatural
tones and gestures, which (as you well ob∣serve)
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Enq. p. 43.</NOTE><HI>are a grand cause of our reproach and
contempt</HI>; and on the other, against that
cold insensible air, which sometimes, amongst
<PB N="38" REF="38"/>
strangers at least, affects even the moral cha∣racter
of the preacher.</P>
<P>I think some care should be taken, both at the
school and the academy, to engage students to a
genteel and complaisant behaviour, not only as
what is apparently conducive to their mutual
ease and pleasure, and the convenience of the
family where they are; but as what may
render them more agreeable and useful in
life, to persons of superior rank, and even
to the populace themselves. For a well-bred
man knows how to condescend, in the most
obliging way; and the common people (such
is either their good sense or their humour)
are peculiarly pleas'd with the visits and
converse of those, who they know may be
welcome to greater company.</P>
<P>And now, Sir, I have done with my sub∣ject,
and must conclude, with assuring you,
that it is not the design of one line which
I have writ, merely to prove, that you are
mistaken in any thing that you have asserted;
and therefore I have purposely avoided many
citations from your Letter, which might easily
have been connected with what I have said.
You will infer from what you have read, that
I differ from you in some other particulars,
which are not mention'd, but they apparent∣ly
depend on what I have debated at large;
and I chose to omit them, not only because
my Letter is already longer than I intended,
but from a general observation, which I have
had frequent occasion to make; that if a
man desires to do good by what he says,
he must oppose and contradict as little as
possible. If I am mistaken in what I have
<PB N="39" REF="39"/>
advanced, I shall be heartily thankful for
better information; and, if it come from
you, it will be peculiarly agreeable, as I shall
have nothing to fear from your reproaches,
and much to hope from your arguments.</P>
