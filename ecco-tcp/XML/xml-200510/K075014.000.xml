<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the great Numbers, who
drink Tar Water in <HI>Dublin,</HI> your
Letter informs me, there are several, that
make or use it in an undue Manner. To ob∣viate
those Inconveniences, and render this
Water as generally useful as possible, you
desire I would draw up some Rules and Re∣marks
in a small Compass, which according∣ly
I here send you.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="part">
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<P>Put a Gallon of cold Water to a Quart
of Tar, stir and work them strongly toge∣ther
for about four Minutes; let the Vessel
stand close covered for eight and forty Hours,
that the Tar may subside; then pour off the
clear Water, and keep it in Bottles, well
corked, for Use: This is a good general Rule,
but as Stomachs and Constitutions are so va∣rious,
it may admit of some Latitude, the less
Water or more stirring makes it stronger, as
more Water or less stirring makes it weaker.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<P>The same Tar will not do so well a second
Time, but may serve for common Uses: The
putting off Tar that hath been used, for fresh
Tar, would be a bad Fraud. To prevent which
it is to be noted, that Tar already used is of a
lighter brown than other Tar. The only Tar
that I have used is that from our Northern
Colonies in <HI>America,</HI> and that from <HI>Norway,</HI>
the latter being thinner, mixeth easier with
Water, and seems to have more Spirit. If the
former be made use of (as I have sometimes
known it with good Success) the Tar Water
will require longer stirring to make it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="part">
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<P>Tar Water, when right, is, not paler than
<HI>French</HI> nor deeper coloured than <HI>Spanish</HI> White
Wine, and full as clear; if there be not a Spi∣rit
very sensibly perceived in drinking, you
may conclude the Tar Water is not good; if
you would have it good, you must see it made
yourself. Those who begin with it, little and
weak, may by Habit come to drink more
and stronger, according to the Season, or the Hu∣mour
of the Patient. It may be drank either
cold or warm; it lays under no Restraint as to
Air, Exercise, Cloaths, or Diet, and may be
taken at all times in the Year.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<P>As to the Quantity in common chronical
Indispositions, one Pint of Tar Water a Day
may suffice, taken on an empty Stomach, at
two or four Times, to wit, Night and Morn∣ing,
and about two Hours after Dinner and
Breakfast; more may be taken by strong Sto∣machs.
Alteratives in general, taken in small
Doses, and often, mix best with the Blood;
how oft or how strong each stomach can bear,
Experience will shew. But those who labour
under great and inveterate Maladies, must drink
a greater Quantity, at least one Quart <HI>per</HI><PB N="4" REF="6"/>
<HI>Diem,</HI> taken at four, six, or eight Glasses, as
best suits the Circumstances and Case of the
Drinker. All of this Class must have much
Patience and Perseverance in the Use of this, as
well as of all other Medicines, which, if sure
and safe, must yet, from the Nature of Things,
be slow in the Cute of inveterate Chronical
Disorders. In acute Cases, Fevers of all Kinds,
it must be drank in Bed warm, and in great
Quantity, the Fever still enabling the Patient
to drink, perhaps a Pint every Hour, which I
have known to work surprising Cures.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<P>As the Morning's Draught is most difficult
to nice Stomachs, such may lessen, or even
omit it, at the Beginning, or rather postpone
it till after Breakfast, and take a larger Dose at
Night; the Distance from Meal-time need not
be more than one Hour, when the Stomach is
strong, or the Glasses small: the Oil that swims
on the Top, may either be drank with the
rest of the Liquor, or skimmed off and kept
for outward Sores. Whether there be any
Difference between old Tar or new Tar, or
which of all the various Tars, produced from
different Trees, or in different Parts of the
World, is most medicinal, future Trials must
determine—I have made a second Sort of
Tar Water, to be used externally, as a Wash
for the Itch, Scabs, Ulcers, Leprosy, and all
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
such foul Cases, which I have tried with Suc∣cess,
and recommend it to the Trial of others.
For inveterate Cases of that Kind, Tar Water
should be drank, a Quart every Day, at fix or
eight Glasses; and at the same time the Wash
applied Outwardly, and warm, by bathing,
fomenting, and steeping, to heal and dry up
the Sores, and this several Times in the twen∣ty-four
Hours. This Water, for external Use,
must be made in the following manner: Pour
two Quarts of hot boiling Water on a Quart of
Tar, stir and work it strongly with a flat Stick
or Ladle, for a full quarter of an Hour; let it
stand eight Hours, then pour it off, and keep
it close covered for Use. It may be made
weaker or stronger as there is Occasion.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>VII.</HEAD>
<P>My Experiments have been made in va∣rious
Cases, and on many Persons; and I make
no doubt its Virtues will soon be more fully
discovered, as Tar-water is now growing into
general Use, tho' not without that Opposition
which usually attends upon Novelty. The
great Objection I find made to this Medicine is,
that it promises too much. What, say the
Objectors, do you pretend to a Panacea, a thing
strange, chimerical, and contrary to the Opi∣nion
and Experience of all Mankind. Now to
speak out, and, give this Objection or Question
a direct Answer, I freely own that I suspect
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
Tar-water is a Panacea. I may be mistaken,
but it is worth trial; for the Chance of so great
and general a Benefit, I am willing to stand
the Ridicule of proposing it. And as the old
Philosopher cried aloud, from the House-top,
to his Fellow Citizens, <HI>educate your Children</HI>;
so, I confess, if I had a Situation high enough,
and a Voice loud enough, I would cry out, to
all the Valetudinarians upon Earth, <HI>drink Tar
Water.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>VIII.</HEAD>
<P>Having thus frankly owned the Charge,
I must explain to you, that by a Panacea is
not meant a Medicine which cures all In∣dividuals,
(this consists not with Mortality)
but a Medicine that cures or relieves all the
different Species of Distempers. And if God
hath given us so great a Blessing, and made a
Medicine so cheap and plentiful as Tar, to
be withal so universal in its Effects, to ease
the Miseries of human Life, shall Men be
ridiculed or bantered out of its Use, espe∣cially
when they run no Risque in the
Trial?</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>IX.</HEAD>
<P>It must be owned I have not had Op∣portunities
of trying it myself in all Cases,
neither will I undertake to demonstrate <HI>a</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="9"/><HI>priori,</HI> that Tar Water is a Panacea. But
yet, methinks, I am not quitedestitute of pro∣bable
Reasons, which, joined to what Facts
I have observed, induced me to entertain
such a Suspicion.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>X.</HEAD>
<P>I know Tar was used to preserve Cattle
from Contagion; and this may be supposed
to have given Rise to that Practice of drin∣king
Tar Water for a Preservative against
the Small-Pox. But as the Tar Water used
for that Purpose was made by mixing equal
Quantities of Tar and Water, it proved a
most offensive Portion; besides, as a fresh
Glass of Water was put in for each Glass
that; was taken our, and this for many Days
on the same Tar, it followed that the Wa∣ter
was not equally impregnated with the fine
volatile Spirit, though all alike strongly saturated
with gross Particles.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="11" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>XI.</HEAD>
<P>Having found this nauseous Draught very
useful against the Small Pox, to as many
as could be prevailed on to take it; I be∣gan
to consider the Nature of Tar. I re∣flected
that Tar is a Balsam flowing from
the Trunks of aged Ever-geens; that it re∣sists
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
Putrefaction; that it hath the Virtues
of Turpentine, which in Medicine are known
to be very great and manifold; but I ob∣served
withal, that Turpentines or Balsams
are very offensive in the taking: I therefore
considered distinctly the several constituent
Parts of Balsams; which were those, where∣in
the medicinal Virtues resided and which
were to be regarded, rather as a Viscous
Matrix to receive, arrest, and retain the
more volatile and active Particles. And if
these last could be so separated and disengaged
from the grosser Parts, as to impreg∣nate
a clear and potable Liquor, I concluded
that such Liquor must prove a Medicine of
great Force, and general Use. I considered,
that Nature was the best Chemist and Pre∣parer
of Medicines, and that the Fragrance
and Flavour of Tar argued very active Qua∣lities
and Virtues.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="12" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>XII.</HEAD>
<P>I had, of a long Time, entertained an
Opinion agreeable to the Sentiments of many
antient Philosophers, <HI>That Fire may be re∣garded
as the Animal Spirit of this visible
World.</HI> And it seemed to me that the at∣tracting
and secreting of this Fire in the va∣rious
Pores, Tubes, and Ducts of Vetegables,
did impart their specifick Virtues to each
Kind; that this same Light, or Fire, was the
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
immediate instrumental or physical Cause
of Sense and Motion, and consequently of Life
and Health to Animals; that on Account of
this Solar Light or Fire, <HI>Phoebus</HI> was in the
ancient Mythology reputed the God of Medi∣cine
Which Light as it is leisurely intro∣duced,
and fixed in the viseid Juice of old
Firs and Pines, so the setting it free in Part,
that is, the changing its viscid for a volatile
Vehicle, which may mix with Water, and
convey it throughout the Habit copiously and
inoffensively, would be of infinite Use in
Physic, extending to all Cases whatsoever,
inasmuch as all Distempers are in Effect a
Struggle, between the <HI>Vis Vitae</HI> and the peculiar
Miasma or Fomes Morbi; and nothing
strengthens Nature, or lends such Aid and
Vigour to Life, as a Cordial which doth not
heat.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="13" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>XIII.</HEAD>
<P>The Solar Light in great Quantity during
the Space of many suocessive Years, being at∣tracted
and detained in the Juice of ancient.
Ever-greens, doth form and lodge itself in an,
Oil so fine and volatile, as shall mix well
with Water, and lightly pass the <HI>Primae Viae.</HI>
and penetrate every Part and Capillary of the
original System, when once exempt and freed
from the grosser nauseous Refin. It will not,
therefore, seem unreasonable to whoever is
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
acquainted with the medicinal Virtues of
Turpentine in so many different Distempers,
for which it hath been celebrated both by
ancient and modern Physicians, and withal
reflects on the Nausea or Clog that prevents
their full Operation and Effect on the human
Body, it will not, I say, seem unreasonable to
such a one to suppose, that if this same Clog
were removed, numberless Cures might be
wrought in great Variety of Cases.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="14" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>XIV.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Desideratum</HI> was, how to separate the
active Particles from the heavy viscid Substance
wich served to attract and retain
them, and so to order Matters, that the
Vehicle of the Spirit should not on the
one hand be volatile enough to escape, nor
on the other, gross enough to offend. For
the performing of this, I have found a most
easy, simple, and effectual Method, which
furnisheth a potable inoffensive Liquor, clear
and fine as the best White Wine, Cordial
and Stomachic, to be kept bottled, as being
endued with a very sensible Spirit, though,
not fermented.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="15" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>XV.</HEAD>
<P>I tried many Experiements as to the Quan∣tity
of Water, and the Time of stirring and
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
standing, in order to impregnate and clarify
it, and, after all, fixed on the forementioned
Receipt, as the most generally useful for
making this salutiferous Liquor well impreg∣nated,
and not offensive to common Stomachs,
and even drank with Pleasure by many: In
which the most medicinal and active Particles,
that is to say, the native Salts, Spirit, and
volatile Oil, being disentangled from the gross
Oil and viscous Resin, can freely pass the
<HI>Primae Viae,</HI> insinuate themselves into the
smallest Ducts, and pervade the whole animal
Machine, and that, in such full Proportion
and Measure, as suiteth every Case and Con∣stitution.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="16" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>XVI.</HEAD>
<P>The foregoing general Considerations put
me upon making Experiments in many va∣rious
and unlike Cases, which otherwise I
should never have thought of doing, and
the Success answered my Hopes. Philosophical
Principles led me to make safe. Trials,
and on those Trials is founded my Opinion
of the salutary Virtues of Tar Water; which
Virtues are recommended from, and depend
on, Experiments and Matters of Fact, and
neither stand nor fall with any Theories or
speculative Principles whatever. Howbeit,
those Theories, as I said, enlarged my Views
of this Medicine, led me to a greater Variety
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
of Trials, and thereby engendered and nou∣rished
my Suspicion, that it is a Panacea. I
have been the more prolix in these Parti∣culars,
hoping that, to as many as shall can∣didly
weigh and consider them, the high
Opinion I conceive of this Medicine will not
seem altogether an Effect of vain Preposses∣sion
or blind empiric Rashness, but rather
the Result of free Thought and Inquiry, and
grounded on my best Reason, Judgment,
and Experience.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="17" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>XVII.</HEAD>
<P>Those who have only the Good of Man∣kind
at Heart, will give this Medicine fair
play; if there be any who act from other
Motives, the Public will look sharp and be∣ware.
To do Justice to Tar Water, as well as
to those who drink it, Regard must be had
to the particular Strength and Case of the
Patients. Grievous or inveterate Maladies
must not be treated as common Cases. I
cured a horrible Case, a Gangrene in the
Blood, which had broke out in several Sores,
and threatened speedy Death, by obliging the
Person to drink nothing but this Liquor for
several Weeks, as much and as often as his
Stomach would bear. Common Sense will
direct a proportionable Conduct in other
Cases. But this must be left to the Con∣science
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
and Disceretion of the Givers and Takers.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="18" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>After all that can be said, it is most certain,
that a Panacea sounds odd, and conveys some∣what
shocking to the Ear and Sense of most
Men, who are wont to rank the universal Me∣dicine
with the Philosophers Stone, and the
Squaring of the Circle; whereof this chief, if
not sole Reason, I take to be, that it is thought
incredible, the same Thing should produce
contrary Effects, as it must do, if it cures op∣posite
Distempers. And yet this is no more
than every Day's Experience verifies. Milk,
for instance, makes some costive, and others
laxative: This regards the Possibility of a Pa∣nacea
in general; as for Tar Water in parti∣cular,
I do not say it is a Panacea, I only sus∣pect
it to be so.—Time and Trial will
shew.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="19" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>XIX.</HEAD>
<P>But I am most sincerely persuaded from
what I have already seen and tryed, that Tar
Water may be drank with great Safety and
Success, for the Cure or Relief of most, if not
all Diseases, of Ulcers, Itch, Scald-heads, Le∣prosy,
the foul Disease, and all foul Cases,
Scurvies of all Kinds, Disorders of the Lungs,
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
Stomach, and Bowels, gouty and nephritic
Ailments, Pleurifies, Peripneumonies, Erysi∣pelas,
and all Kinds of Fevers, Hysteric and
all nervous Cases, Dropsies, Decays, and other
Maladies; nor is it of Use only in the Cure of
Sickness, it is also useful to preserve Health,
and guard against Infection, and, in some mea∣sure,
even against old Age, as it gives lasting
Spirits, and invigorates the Blood. I am even
induced by the Nature and Analogy of Things,
and its wonderful Success in Fevers of all
Kinds, to think that Tar Water may be useful
against the Plague, both as a Preservative
and a Cure.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="20" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>XX.</HEAD>
<P>But I doubt no Medicine can withstand that
execrable Plague of distilled Spirits, which
all without Exception, (the Fire of the hot
Still imparting a caustic and coagulating Qua∣lity
to all distilled Spirits, whatever the Subject
or Ingredients may be) operate as a slow Poison,
preying on the Vitals, and wasting the Health
and Strength of Body and Soul; which Pest
of human Kind is, I am told, gaining Ground
in this Country, already too thin of Inhabi∣tants.</P>

<HEAD>AN
ANSWER
TO
A
LETTER
To the Right Reverend
The BISHOP of CLOYNE. Occasioned by
His Treatise of TAR-WATER.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN a Gentleman had proposed a
Medicine to the World, which from
repeated Experience he had found to be of
singular Efficacy, one would think he had a
Right to be heard with Candour, if not with
Applause. But the Author of a Letter to the
Bishop of <HI>Cloyne,</HI> has attack'd him in a Man∣ner
as much below the Character of a Gen∣tleman
to offer, as a Bishop to receive. It is,
to say the least of it, what the Author professes
it to be, with the UTMOST FREEDOM. He
compares him to a <HI>Quack, a boasting Mounte∣bank</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="19" MS="y"/>
Dr. <HI>Salmon,</HI> Dr. <HI>Rock,</HI> the <HI>Devil</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">'There is, my Lord, another Being (whom I have have more Reverence than' to name in your Lordship's Company, and whose Actions, nothing but the <HI>perfect Justice</HI> and <HI>Equality</HI> of the <HI>Allusion</HI> can attone for my mentioning with your Lordship's) who can cite Scripture for his Purpose.' <HI>Letter,</HI> p. 27.</NOTE>.
Himself the World will probably guess to be a
Physician. A <HI>thorough bread Man,</HI> no doubt;
and, I suppose, the great Point be has in view
is to lie half discovered, half concealed, ready
to be called forth from his present Obscurity
into Practice, when he has raised a Character
by demolishing a Writer of Eminence.</P>
<P>But <HI>Physician</HI> as he supposes the World will
take him to be, I much doubt whether it may
mot give to the Bishop, even in <HI>that Respect,</HI>
the Preference. To make a Science a <HI>Nostrum,</HI>
is as <HI>quackish</HI> as to make a Medicine one.
Knowledge is open to every Man of Sense and
Application; and has the Bishop shewn his
Want of either in his Study of Physic, tho' it
is not more immediately his Profession? How
frequently have Physicians turn'd Divines?
where is the Absurdity for a Divine to become
a Physician? Is the Pale of Physic only so nar∣row
that it admits of no Interlopers? What
then does this <HI>Gentleman</HI> mean, when he tells
us<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Page 36.</NOTE>, <HI>the principal Points of Knowledge neces∣sary
to a Physician, are</HI> NATURALLY <HI>wanting</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="20"/><HI>in a Divine</HI>? Alas! it is not the Degree, or
the Robe, the tye Wig, or the Gold-headed
Cane, that makes the Physician, anymore than.
Prunella the Parson. But the Knowledge of
either may be concealed under every Habit,
and the seven Sciences contained without a
College Title.</P>
<P>Need I produce Authority or Example for
this? the two great Names of <HI>Bacon</HI> and <HI>Boyle</HI>
will be lasting Monuments, that the Know∣ledge
of Physic is not confined to those of the
Profession only.</P>
<P>But the Letter-Writer says<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Page 36.</NOTE>, He cannot
<HI>guess,</HI> from any Part of the Bishop's Treatise,
<HI>that he ever made Physic his Study.</HI> Many
others say, he talks as rationally of it as those
that have. This Author himself obse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ves<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Page 37.</NOTE>,
That he has <HI>searched the Books of Physicians
for Histories of Diseases,</HI> and to find out <HI>the
peculiar</HI> Properties <HI>of Medicines</HI>; no small Part
of a Physician's Learning, as much, I believe,
as many an one sets up on. But because the
Bishop has applied it to the magnifying his fa∣vourite
Medicine, this Author will not allow
him to have made any Improvement from his
Researches.</P>
<P>Will it be said, that Physic has eluded his
Labours, because the Theory of it is more
<PB N="20" REF="21"/>
extensive than any other? The World has ge∣nerally
judged very differently. And, if we
consider how sacredly the Avenues to this Sci∣ence
are guarded, by mysteriously prescribbing
Things unknown in an unknown Tongue, how
it is conversant with Mankind in its weakest
State, when the Mind is drooping, and catches
at any Thing that promises Relief, the whole
Faculty ought with <HI>Humility and Thankful∣ness</HI>
to acknowledge the Reputation the World
has given them. Nay, I would appeal to this
very Writer, whether he is not persuaded, that e∣ven
a regular Physician's Practice does not depend
more on his Address to the Whims and Foi∣bles
of his Patients, than his real Skill in his
profession. I ask this, when he has compar'd
his own Merit with his Practice. I know his
<HI>natural</HI> Pride will extort from him what his
<HI>artificial</HI> Pride would tempt him to conceal.</P>
<P>To <HI>Sense</HI> and <HI>Study</HI> has not the Bishop
join'd <HI>Experience</HI>? Experience founded on
his own unbounded Generosity to the Poor,
itself an Hospital without adventitious Sub∣scriptions.
And is he not to be believ'd, when
he tells us, without Fee or Reward, he has
known, frequently known, after repeated Tri∣als,
upon various Constitutions, his Medicine
prove successful? The Letter-Writer says the
Facts were all<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Page 36.</NOTE> <HI>misunderstood,</HI> and endea∣vours
to prove from Theory, that<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Page 18.</NOTE> <HI>Tar</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="22"/><HI>Water is no Medicine, something</HI> HARDLY
<HI>worth the Name of one, and that it can care
no one Disease.</HI> Nay, to make sure Work, and
to be as far in one Extreme as the Bishop in
the, other, That it can do no Good<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Page 20.</NOTE>, but
may do Harm. He assures us <HI>Cold Water
oured on Tar can take none, not the least of
its Medicinal Virtues</HI>: That, <HI>if we ask the
Chemist, he will tell us,</HI> "Oil cannot be mix'd with, or drawn forth by Cold Water." Now
in Obedience to this Gentleman I have <HI>ask'd</HI>
the Chemist, and he tells me, that some of
<HI>the Virtues of the Oil of Tar may be drawn
forth by Cold Water.</HI> And I have actually
tasted Water, wherein the Oil of Tar was
washed (two Ounces to a Pint) strongly im∣bued
with its Virtues, and which had much
the same Taste with Water wherein the Oil
of <HI>Benzoin</HI> was washed. In Analyzing Tar
there are found to come over some fine Flow∣ers,
so quick with the Oil that they cannot be
separated, which may be communicated to
Water. And it is well known, all Acids will
imbibe some Part of the Flowers, or finest
Part of the Oil of all Resinous Substances.
As it may afford some Satisfaction to the Let∣ter-Writer,
and enable others to determine
more particularly the Virtues of Tar, I shall
set down the Product of 22 Pound of the best
<HI>Norway</HI> Tar by two Retorts; <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P>After <HI>Theory</HI> the Letter-Writer proceeds
to prove that Tar Water can do no good,
from <HI>Experience.</HI> Here then, let Issue be
joined, and from one Assertion, which all
the World may judge of, let this Writer's
Credit stand or fall:—<HI>Crimine ab uno—Disce omnes.</HI></P>
<P>He saies, <HI>Of this Medicine's Power of
doing Harm, we have too many Proofs, if
we could overlook the Fatigues of the Phy∣sicians
and Apothecaries unable to go through
the Load of Business and the visible Increase
in the Bills of Mortality! The Fatigues of
Physicians!</HI> His own, I suppose, included in
that Number, in the midst of which it was
Excess of Good Nature to find Time to
write so long a Pamphlet. <HI>The Increase in
the Bills of Mortality!</HI> To them then let
us go: The Bishop's Book was published in
<HI>England</HI> I think, about the Middle of <HI>April</HI>:
The Medicine recommended in it came into
greatest Vogue about the beginning of <HI>June,</HI>
and the Bills of Mortality stand thus:

So that, we see, after all this mighty Parade
about the Bills of Mortality, they were low∣est,
when Tar Water was in its highest
Repute; or, take which Period you please,
afterwards for its Season, before this Au∣thor's
Book appeared, the Alteration was in∣considerable;
increased the next Week 33,
and decreased again 23. Such abundant Rea∣son
had he to set out with a Maxim which
he learnt from his own Experience more than
universal Consent, <HI>That Truth and Partiality
are inconsistent.</HI></P>
<P>After these Specimens of his Skill in the
<HI>Nature of Medicines</HI> and of his Faithfulness
in the <HI>History of Cases,</HI> he may charge the
Bishop with Deficiency in both Particulars,
and please himself with the Thoughts, that
the World will probably <HI>guess' himself to be
a Physician.</HI> I leave him and it in the quiet Pos∣sion
of that Satisfaction.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="25"/>
The rest of his Letter is chiefly taken
up in Mirth and Pastime; he <HI>plays the
Doctor,</HI> as he calls it, and throws out plenty
of Jokes to gather the Crowd together, and
help off a Six-penny Packet.—He describes
the Witty Reflections of the Company he
kept,—or such as he has made for them.</P>
<P>Take a Specimen of the Weak Defender
of the Bishop, and of the acute Opponent;
<HI>Come says another with a World of important
Nothing in his Look, the Bishop is a Man of
sound Learning, I avouch it, and I have
read—And what then, says another</HI> [the
Letter-Writer,] <HI>his Knowledge is borrowed
from the Writings of other Men</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Page 11.</NOTE>. I wonder
how this Author got his: I fancy, as Serjeant
<HI>Kite,</HI> saies, he came into the World of his
own Head.</P>
<P>Another witty Observer saies, the Bishop
has <HI>serv'd his Medicine just as</HI> Pope <HI>serv'd him,
by giving it ev'ry Virtue under Heaven</HI> upon
which the Author notes:—<HI>unless it be true,
what some People say, That he never praised
any Body, but with an</HI> INTENT <HI>that the World
should construe it into something more bitter then
his severest Raillery</HI><NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>

Great and Generous, thus with a single
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>roke to destroy the general Character of an
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sent Bishop, and a Poet just cold in his
Grave! But as the Discovery it wonderful, it
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ght not to be concealed; and there is less
Reason to expect it should, bccause it carries
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> own Reward with it. For this Author and
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Friends will go on to construe the rest of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Works of that great Genius backwards,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for the Comfort of their Party invert the

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ard a Story of a Hero in <HI>Bedlam,</HI> who told a

the Doctor,</HI> he examines carefully the very

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> no very different Purpose? But the Difficul∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
is, How Tar and Honey came there, since
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is not in the <HI>Body</HI> of the Book. I will not
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>etend to account for the <HI>Phaenomenon,</HI> but
<PB N="26" REF="27"/>
shall only observe almost as odd an one in this
Writer's Letter. As an Instance how the Sense
of Words may be perverted, he tells us a Story
of great Effects<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Page 28.</NOTE> produced by a trifling Altera∣tion
in the Pointing. "Instead of <HI>Cain</HI>'s saying,
<HI>I have killed a Man</HI> with a Colon at the
End, which makes it a Confession of Guilt,
only write it thus, <HI>I have killed a Man.</HI>"
Where is the Difference? This Story, it
seems made him <HI>wonder,</HI> when he heard it,
and it makes the Reader <HI>stare,</HI> when he reads it.
It should be, I suppose, <HI>Have I killed a Man.</HI>
But when he tells us how the fame Blun∣der
came to stand in his second Edition, as well
as in his first, we may find out perhaps how
<HI>Tar and Honey</HI> came to be in the <HI>Index</HI> only.</P>
<P>The Bishop having illustrated how Acid
are sheathed by Alkalies from a Simile of Spi∣gots
and Faucets, this Author's Modesty I
much offended at it. Hail! <HI>Woodward</HI> lives
I cannot but admire, saies he, <HI>the perfect
Decency of your Lordship's Manner, your ex∣cellent
Cleaness as well as Delicacy in</HI> Sm∣lles.
Which reminds me of the Lady that
could not bear a Chapter of hard Names
for Fear there should be some what immodes
in them.</P>
<P>But it is not enough that he cut down the
Bishop in Physic, unless he makes Reprisals
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>
upon him in Divinity. He charges him
with making the Scriptures serve the Turn
of his Philosophy <HI>by new Translaitions, and
even where there was no need of it.</HI> This, I
suppose, alludes to §. 179. where the Bishop
observes that the Passage in the Psalms, <HI>who
maketh his Ministers a flaming Fire,</HI> might as
well be rendered, and more agreeably to the
Context, <HI>who maketh flaming Fire his Mini∣sters.</HI>
If it is more agreeable to the Context,
why will this Author say, <HI>There was no need
of the Alteration</HI>? And, as to the Charge of
Novelty, there is scarce a Commentator but
gives the Passage the same Construction, tho'
they have nothing to do with the Bishiop's
Hypothesis. Without a Pomp of Quotations,
I recommend only to this Author's Polite
Taste, <HI>Buchanan's</HI> Version; or, if that is more
suitable to it, <HI>Sternhold</HI> and <HI>Hopkins.</HI></P>
<Q>Apparent accinctae <HI>AURAE FLAMMAEQUE</HI>
ministrae.</Q>
<P>In the same Place he saies, <HI>I shall only
commemorate to your Lordship's Honour as a
Bishop, that you can soften Atheism into Mis∣construction.</HI>
Ay, and this very Lordship he
<HI>honours and respects,</HI> As A Bishop, <HI>whom as a
Physician he despises.</HI> It is plain, his <HI>personal
Charity</HI> is as great as his <HI>publick Zeal,</HI> which
could prompt him to consute an Author, half
dead as he was with the Fatigues of Practice
which that very Author had helped him to.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="29"/>
But how has his Lordship been guilty of
lessening Atheism? Why he has vindicated,
it seems, <HI>Aristotle</HI> and some other Philosophers
from that Imputation, by shewing how their
Principles have been mistaken. Atheism the
Bishop leaves just what it was; but shews those
Venerable Sages did not come within the Verge
of it. Where is the Harm? If we will not
take them as Partners of our Natural Creed,
another Sett of Men will be proud of them.
Here our Author's Zeal gets the better of his
Charity, and he betrays a little of that un∣sociable
Temper by which he excluded the Clergy from the
College of Physicians, some
of whom, I am persuaded, cure more than
many a Licentiate. From the same Turn of
Mind he seems proud to characterise himself
at parting, when he lets the Bishop know
what he should have done to have prevented
the Attacks of so formidable an Adversary:
Then, saies he,<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Page 37.</NOTE> <HI>No carping Wit or sour
Pbilosopher would have dared to have blamed you.</HI></P>
