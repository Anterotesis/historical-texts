<P>NEITHER majesty and elegance of form,
strength of body, freedom of movement,
nor other external qualities, constitute the
principal dignity of animated beings. In man,
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
we prefer genius to figure, courage to strength,
and sentiment to beauty; and, therefore, we are
induced to think, that the chief excellence of an
animal consists also of internal qualities. By
these he differs from an automation, rises above
the vegetable tribes, and approaches the human
species. It is sentiment which ennobles, go∣verns,
and gives activity to all his organs and
propensities. Hence the perfection of an ani∣mal
depends on sentiment alone; and, in pro∣portion
to its extent, his faculties, resources, and
relations with the rest of the universe, are aug∣mented.
When his sentiment is delicate, and
improved by education, he is then fit to associate
with man, to concur with his designs, to aid, to
defend, and to caress him. By a frequent per∣formance
of these services, he conciliates the fa∣vour
of his master, and, from a tyrant, converts
him into a friend and protector.</P>
<P>The dog, independent of the beauty of his
figure, his strength, vivacity, and nimbleness,
possesses every internal excellence which can at∣tract
the regard of man. A passionate, and even
a ferocious and sanguinary temper, renders the
wild dog formidable to all animals. But, in the
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
domestic dog, these hostile dispositions vanish,
and are succeeded by the softer sentiments of
attachment, and the desire of pleasing. He runs
with chearfulness and alacrity to his master's
foot, where he lays down his courage, his
strength, and his talents. He attends for or∣ders,
which he is always solicitous to execute.
He consults, he interrogates, he supplicates his
master. A single glance of the eye is sufficient;
for he knows the external signs of our inten∣tions
and wishes. Without being endowed, like
man, with the faculty of thinking, his feelings
are extremely delicate, and he has more fidelity
and steadiness in his affection. He is not cor∣rupted
by ambition, by interested views, or by a
desire of revenge; and he has no fear, but that
of displeasing. He is all zeal, ardour, and obe∣dience.
More apt to recal benefits than out∣rages,
he is not discouraged by blows or bad
treatment, but calmly suffers, and soon forgets
them; or he remembers them only to increase
his attachment. Instead of flying, or discover∣ing
marks of resentment, he exposes himself to
torture, and licks the hand from which he re∣ceived
the blow. To the cruelty of his master,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> only opposes complaint, patience, and sub∣mission.</P>
<P>More tractable than man, and more plaint
than any other animal, the dog is not only soon
instructed, but even conforms himself to the
manners, movements, and habits of those who
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>
govern him. He assumes the very tone of the
family in which he lives. Like other servants,
he is haughty with the great, and rustic with
the peasant. Always eager to obey and to please
his master, or his friends, he pays no attention
to strangers, and furiously repels beggars, whom
he distinguishes by their dress, their voice, and
their gestures. When the charge of a house or
garden is committed to him during the night,
his boldness increases, and he sometimes becomes
perfectly ferocious. He watches, goes the
rounds, smells strangers at a distance, and, if they
stop, or attempt to leap any barrier, he instant∣ly
darts upon them, and, by barking, and other
marks of passion, alarms the family and neigh∣bourhood.
Equally furious against thieves as
against rapacious animals, he attacks and wounds
them, and forces from them whatever they have
been attempting to carry off: But, contented
with victory, he lies down upon the spoil, and
will not touch it even to satisfy his appetite, ex∣hibiting,
at the same time, an example of cou∣rage,
temperance, and fidelity.</P>
<P>To conceive the importance of this species in
the order of Nature, let us suppose that it never
existed. Without the assistance of the dog, how
could man have conquered, tamed, and reduced
the other animals into slavery? How could he
still discover, hunt down, and destroy noxious
and savage beasts? For his own safety, and to
render him master of the animated world, it was
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
necessary to form a party among the animals
themselves, to conciliate by caresses those which
were capable of attachment and obedience, in
order to oppose them to the other species. Hence
the training of the dog seems to have been the
first art invented by man; and the result of this
art was the conquest and peaceable possession of
the earth.</P>
<P>Most animals are superior to man in agility,
swiftness, strength, and even in courage: Na∣ture
has fortified and armed them better. Their
senses, and particularly that of smelling, are like∣wise
more perfect. To have brought over to
our interest a bold and tractable species, like that
of the dog, was to acquire new senses and fa∣culties.
The machines and instruments we have
invented to improve, or to extend our other
senses, are not nearly so useful as those presented
to us ready made by Nature, which, by supply∣ing
the defects of our smelling, have furnished
us with great and permanent resources for con∣quest
and dominion. The dog, ever faithful to
man, will always maintain a portion of this em∣pire;
he will always preserve a degree of supe∣riority
above the other animals. He reigns at
the head of a flock, and is better heard than the
voice of the shepherd. Safety, order, and dis∣cipline,
are the fruits of his vigilance and acti∣vity.
Sheep and cattle are a people subjected to
his management, whom he prudently conducts
and protects, and never employs force against
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>
them, but for the preservation of peace and good
order.</P>
<P>But in war against his enemies, or wild ani∣mals,
he makes a full display of his courage and
intelligence. Here his natural and acquired ta∣lents
are united. As soon as the din of arms is
heard, as soon as the horn, or the voice of the
hunter, gives the alarm, the dog, sparkling with
redoubled ardour, demonstrates his joy by the
most lively emotions: He announces, by his
movements and cries, his impatience for the
combat, and his passion for victory. Sometimes
he moves silently along, reconnoitres the ground,
and endeavours to discover and surprise the e∣nemy.
At other times, he traces the animal's
steps, and, by different accents, indicates the di∣stance,
the species, and even the age of the fu∣gitive.
Pushed, intimidated, and despairing of
safety from flight alone, the poor animal like∣wise
exerts its faculties, and opposes craftiness
to sagacity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See below, article Deer.</NOTE>. The resources of instinct are now
worthy of admiration. To make him lose the
scent, the creature doubles, returns on its former
steps, bounds, and wishes to detach itself from the
earth; at one leap it often clears a highway, or
a hedge, and swims over brooks and rivers. But,
always pursued, and being unable to conceal or
annihilate its body, the animal endeavours to
start another of less experience, and, after run∣ning
together till the former imagines that the
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>
two scents or traces are confounded, it then
suddenly separates, in order to let the other fall
a victim to the deceived enemy.</P>
<P>But the dog, by the superiority he has acqui∣red
from habit and education, and from the pe∣culiar
fineness of his sensations, loses not the ob∣ject
of his pursuit. By the acuteness of his scent,
he unravels all the windings of the labyrinth,
all the false routs which were intended to de∣ceive
him; and, instead of abandoning the ene∣my
for an indifferent animal, he redoubles his
ardour, he overtakes, attacks, slays, and extin∣guishes
his thirst and his rage in the blood of the
victim.</P>
<P>The propensity to hunting, or to war, is e∣qually
strong in man as in other animals. The
whole knowledge of the Savage is confined to
fighting and hunting. All carnivorous animals,
which have weapons and strength, hunt natu∣rally.
The lion and the tiger, whose strength
is so great as to insure them of victory, hunt a∣lone,
and without artifice. Wolves, foxes, and
wild dogs, hunt in packs, assist each other with
much art, and mutually share in the prey. When
the natural talents of the dog have been impro∣ved
by education, when he has learned to re∣press
his ardour, and to regulate his movements,
he then hunts artificially, and is always certain
of success.</P>
<P>In desert and depopulated countries, there are
wild dogs, which, in their manners, differ not from
<PB N="8" REF="14"/>
wolves, excepting by the facility with which
they may be tamed. They unite in troops, and
attack wild boars, and bulls, and even lions and
tigers. The wild dogs of America are of the
domestic race, and were transported thither from
Europe. Some of them have been abandoned
in these deserts, where they have multiplied so
prodigiously, that they spread over the inhabited
countries in great packs, and attack the domestic
cattle, and even insult the natives, who are ob∣liged
to disperse and kill them, like other fero∣cious
animals. Wild dogs, though they have
no knowledge of man, when approached with
gentleness, soon soften, become familiar, and
remain faithfully attached to their masters. But
the wolf, though taken young, and brought up
in the house, is only gentle when a mere cub,
never loses his taste for prey, and sooner or later
indulges his inclination for rapine and destruc∣tion.</P>
<P>The dog may be said to be the only animal
whose fidelity is unshaken; who always knows
his master, and the friends of the family; who
distinguishes a stranger as soon as he arrives;
who understands his own name, and the voices
of the domestics; who confides not in himself;
who calls on his lost master by cries and lamen∣tation;
who, in long journeys, which he has
travelled but once, remembers and finds out the
roads: In fine, the dog is the only animal whose
<PB N="9" REF="15"/>
natural talents are conspicuous, and whose edu∣cation
is always successful.</P>
<P>Of all animals, the dog is also most suscep∣tible
of impressions, most easily modified by
moral causes, and most subject to alterations oc∣casioned
by physical influence. His tempera∣ment,
faculties, and habits, very prodigiously;
and even the figure of his body is by no means
constant. In the same country, one dog differs
greatly from another; and, in different climates,
the very species seems to be changed. From
these causes, the number and mixture of races
are so great, that it is almost impossible to re∣cognise
or enumerate them. To the same causes
must be attributed those remarkable varieties in
size, figure, length of muzzle, form of the head,
length and direction of the ears and tail, colour,
quantity of hair, &amp;c. In a word, nothing seems
to be permanent in these animals but their in∣ternal
organization, and the faculty of procrea∣ting
together. As those which differ most from
each other are capable of intermixing and of
producing fertile individuals, it is evident, that
all dogs, however diversified, constitute but one
species.</P>
<P>In this numerous variety of races, it is diffi∣cult
to investigate the character of the primitive
stock from which they have all sprung. How
shall the effects produced by the influence of
climate, food, &amp;c. be distinguished? How shall
we perceive the changes introduced by the
<PB N="10" REF="16"/>
mixture of different races when in a wild, or in
a domestic state? In the progress of time, all
these causes alter the most permanent forms;
and the original stamp of Nature never preserves
its purity in beings which have been long under
the management of man. This original im∣pression
is best preserved in those animals that
have the independent choice both of their cli∣mate
and food, the most antient of which are
still faithfully represented by their descendants.
But those which man has subdued, transported
from climate to climate, and changed their food,
their habits, and manner of living, must neces∣sarily
have suffered the greatest alterations in
their form; and, it is a well known fact, that
there are more varieties among the domestic
than the wild animals: And, of all domestic
animals, as the dog is most closely attached to
man, lives as irregularly, and is endowed with
dispositions which render him docile, obedient,
susceptible of every impression, and submissive
to every restraint, it is not surprising that he
should likewise exhibit the greatest variety in
figure, size, colour, and other qualities.</P>
<P>But other causes concur in producing these
changes. The life of the dog is short; his pro∣lific
powers are great; and, as he is perpetually
under the eye of man, whenever by any acci∣dent,
which is not uncommon in Nature, some
individuals, marked with singular characters, ap∣peared,
they would be perpetuated by prevent∣ing
<PB N="11" REF="17"/>
their intermixture with any other kinds, as
is done at present when we want to procure
new races of dogs, or of other animals. Be∣sides,
though every species were equally antient,
the number of generations, from the creation,
being greater in those whose lives are short,
their varieties, alterations, and even degenera∣tion,
must become more conspicuous; because
they are farther removed from the original stock
than those which live longer. Man is at pre∣sent
eight times nearer Adam, than the dog to
his first parent; because man lives eighty years,
and the dog only ten. If, therefore, by any
cause, these two species had an equal tendency
to degenerate, the alteration would be ten times
more strongly marked in the dog than in man.</P>
<P>Those small animals whose lives are so short,
that they are succeeded every year by a new
generation, are infinitely more subject to varia∣tions
of every kind than those which live longer.
The same remark is applicable to annual plants;
some of which may be considered as of an arti∣ficial
or factitious nature. Wheat, for example,
has been so greatly altered by man, that it is
now no where to be found in a natural state.
It has a similarity to darnel, dog's-grass, and
several other grasses; but still we know not to
which of these plants it ought to be referred:
And, as it is annually renewed, is used as the
common food of man, and more cultivated than
any other vegetable, its nature, of course, has
<PB N="12" REF="18"/>
undergone the greatest alterations. Hence man
is able, not only to make every individual in the
universe answer his own ends, but, with the as∣sistance
of time, he can change, modify, and
improve their species. This is the chief power
he possesses over Nature. To have transformed
a barren herb into wheat, is a kind of creation,
of which, however, we have no reason to boast,
since it is only by the sweet of our brows, and
reiterated culture, that we are able to extract
from the earth a scanty, and often a bitter sub∣sistance.</P>
<P>Hence, both in the animal and vegetable king∣doms,
the species which have received the high∣est
culture from man, have undergone the great∣est
changes from their original condition: And,
as we are often unable to recognise their primi∣tive
form, as in the example of wheat and other
grain, it is not impossible, that, among the nu∣merous
varieties of dogs which at present subsist,
not one of them should resemble the first ani∣mal
of the species that virtually gave birth to
the whole.</P>
<P>Nature, however, when not restrained, never
fails to resume her rights. Wheat, when sown
on uncultivated ground, degenerates the very
first year; and, if sown for a succession of ages
upon the same ground, this degeneration would
gradually proceed till the plant acquired its ori∣ginal
from. By an experiment of this kind,
the time required by Nature for destroying the
<PB N="13" REF="19"/>
effects of art, and resuming her pristine state,
might be discovered. This experiment might
be easily performed on plants: But, in animals,
there is little hope of its success; because it is
difficult to manage them with sufficient dexte∣rity,
or to overcome their invincible repugnance
against every thing that restrains or counteracts
their natural or acquired habits. We cannot,
therefore, expect to learn, by this method, the
primitive race of dogs, or of other animals
which are subjected to permanent varieties. But,
to supply the place of facts which cannot be a∣scertained,
we may collect particular marks, and
from these draw probable conjectures.</P>
<P>The domestic dogs which were abandoned in
the deserts of America, and have lived in a wild
state during 150 or 200 years, though original∣ly
derived from altered races, must, during so
long a course of time, have made greater or
smaller approaches toward their primitive form.
Travellers, however, inform us, that they re∣semble
our grey-hounds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. des avanturiers Flibustiers, par Oexmelin, tom. 1. p. 112.</NOTE>. They make the
same remark with regard to the wild dogs of
Congo<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hist. gen. des voyages, par l'Abbé Prevost, tom. 1. p. 86.</NOTE>, which, like those of America, make
war in packs against tigers, lions, &amp;c. But o∣thers,
without comparing the wild dogs of St
Domingo to grey-hounds, only observe, that
they have generally a long flat head, a slender
<PB N="14" REF="20"/>
muzzle, a ferocious air, and meagre bodies; that
they are exceedingly swift in the chace, hunt in
the most perfect manner, and easily tame, when
taken young<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nonv. voyages aux isles de l'Amerique, tom. 5. p. 195.</NOTE>. Thus these wild dogs are very
meagre and fleet; and, as the common grey-hounds
differs little, in other respects, from the
Irish grey-hound, or from the shepherd's dog,
it is probable that those wild dogs rather belong
to this kind than to the true grey-hound race;
for, on the other hand, the more antient travel∣lers
tell us, that the native dogs of Canada had
erect ears, like the fox, and resembled our vil∣lage
or shepherd's dog<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Voyage du pays des Hurons, par Sabard Theodat, p. 310.</NOTE>; that those belonging
to the savages of the Antilles had very long
heads and ears, and approached to the figure of
foxes<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Hist. gen. des Antilles, par le P. du Tertre, tom. 2. p. 306.</NOTE>; that the Indians of Peru had only a
large and a small kind, which they called <HI>Alco</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Hist des Incas, tom. 1. p. 265. Wafer's voyage subjoined to those of Dampier, vol. 4 p. 223.</NOTE>;
and that those of the Isthmus of America were
very ugly, and had long, coarse hair, which
likewise implies erect ears<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Nouveaux voyages aux isles de l'Amerique, tom. 5. p. 195.</NOTE>. Hence it is appa∣rent,
that the original dogs of America, before
they had any communication with those of Eu∣rope,
were all of one race, and that they ap∣proached
most to the dogs with slender muzzles,
erect ears, and coarse hair, like the shepherd's
<PB N="15" REF="21"/>
dog: And I am still farther convinced that the
wild dogs of St Domingo are not genuine grey∣hounds,
because the latter is so rare in France,
that they are brought, for the use of the King,
from Constantinople and other parts of the Le∣vant,
and because I never knew of any grey∣hounds
being transported to France from St Do∣mingo,
or any of our American colonies. Besides,
by consulting what travellers have said concer∣ning
the dogs of different countries, we find that
all the dogs of cold climates have long muzzles
and erect ears; that those of Lapland are small,
and have long hair, erect ears, and sharp muz∣zles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage de la Martiniere, p. 75. II Genio vagante, vol. 2. p. 13.</NOTE>;
that the Siberian dogs<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See plate XXIX.</NOTE>, and those called
wolf-dogs, are larger than the Lapland kind;
but their ears are still erect, their hair coarse,
and their muzzle sharp; that those of Iceland<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See plate XXX.</NOTE>
are nearly similar to the Siberian dog; and, in
the same manner, that the native dogs of the
Cape of Good Hope<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Descrip∣tion du Cap. par Kolbe, part. 1. p. 304.</NOTE>, and other warm climates,
have pointed muzzles, erect ears, long trailing
tails, and clear, but long, rough hair; that those
dogs are excellent for guarding flocks, and, of
course, that they resemble the shepherd's dog,
not only in figure, but in instinct; that, in still
warmer climates, as at Madagascar<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Flacourt, p. 152.</NOTE>, Madura<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage d'Innigo de Biervillas, p. 178.</NOTE>,
<PB N="16" REF="22"/>
Calicut<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Francis Pyrard, tom. 1. p. 426.</NOTE>, and Malabar<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Jean Ovington, tom. 1. p. 276.</NOTE>, the native dogs have
all long muzzles, erect ears, and have such a re∣semblance
to the shepherd's dog, that, when I∣rish
grey-hounds, spaniels, water-dogs, bull-dogs,
blood-hounds, grey-hounds, &amp;c. were
transported thither, they degenerated at the se∣cond
or third generation; lastly, that, in exces∣sive
warm countries, as in Guiney<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Hist. gen. des voy∣ages, par M. l'Abbé Prevost, tom. 4. p. 229.</NOTE>, this dege∣neration
is still quicker; for, in three or four
years, they lose their voice, bark no more, but
make a dismal kind of howling noise; and their
progeny have erect ears, like the fox. The na∣tive
dogs of those countries are ugly animals,
with sharp muzzles, long erect ears, and long
pointed tails. There is no hair on their bo∣dies;
their skin is commonly spotted, but some∣times
of a uniform colour: In a word, they are
disagreeable to the eye, and still more so to the
touch.</P>
<P>We may, therefore, suppose, with some de∣gree
of probability, that the shepherd's dog ap∣proaches
nearer to the primitive race than any
of the other kinds; for in every country inha∣bited
by savage or by half civilized men, the
native dogs resemble this race more than any
other. Besides, in the whole of the New Con∣tinent,
there was no other variety; neither is
there any other at the south and north extre∣mities
<PB N="17" REF="23"/>
of our own continent; and in France,
and other temperate climates, they are very nu∣merous,
though greater attention has been paid
to the rearing of other more beautiful kinds,
than to the preservation of this race, which has
no recommendation but its utility, and for that
reason has been abandoned to the care of the
sheep-farmers. If it be farther considered, that
this dog, notwithstanding his ugliness, and his
wild and melancholy aspect, is superior in in∣stinct
to all others; that he has a decided cha∣racter,
independent of education; that he a∣lone
is born fully trained; that, guided sole∣ly
by natural powers, he applies himself spon∣taneously
to the keeping of flocks, which he
executes with amazing fidelity, vigilance, and
assiduity; that he conducts them with an admi∣rable
and uncommunicated intelligence; that his
talents, at the same time astonish and give re∣pose
to his master, while other dogs require the
most laborious instruction to train them to the
purposes for which they are destined; we will
be confirmed in the opinion, that the shepherd's
dog is the true dog of Nature; that he has been
preferably bestowed on us for the extent of his
utility; that he has a superior relation to the
general order of animated beings, who mutually
depend on each other; and, lastly, that he ought
to be regarded as the origin and model of the
whole species.</P>
<P>In the frozen regions of the north, the human
species is deformed, rustic, and diminutive. Lap∣land,
<PB N="18" REF="24"/>
Greenland, and all countries where the
cold is excessive, produce only dwarfish and ugly
men. But, in the neighbouring and less rigo∣rous
regions of Finland, Denmark, &amp;c. the most
beautiful race sudenly appears; for, in figure,
colour, and stature, they are perhaps the hand∣somest
of the human kind. The same phaeno∣menon
is exhibited in the dog-species. The
Lapland dogs are very ugly, and so small, that
they exceed not a foot in length<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">II Genio vagante, vol. 2. p. 13.</NOTE>. Those of
Siberia, though less ugly, have erect ears, and a
savage aspect: But, in the neighbouring climate,
where we meet with the handsome men already
mentioned<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See vol. 3. art. Varieties of the human species.</NOTE>, we find also the most beautiful and
largest dogs. The dogs of Tartary, of Albania,
of the north of Greece, of Denmar, and of Ire∣land,
are the largest and strongest of the species,
and are used for drawing carriages. The Irish
grey-hounds are of a very antient race, and still
exist, though their number is small, in their ori∣ginal
climate. They were called by the antients
dogs of Epirus, and Albanian dogs. Pliny has
recorded, in most elegant and energetic terms, a
combat between one of these dogs, first with a
lion, and then with an elephant<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Indiam petenti Alexandro magno, Rex Albaniae dono dederat inusitatae magnitudinis unum, cujus specie delectatus, jussit ursos. mox apros, et deinde damas emitti, contemptu im∣mobili jacente eo; qua segnitie tanti corporis offensus Impe∣rator generosi spiritus, eum interimi jussit.

They are
<PB N="19" REF="25"/>
much larger than the mastiff. In France, they
are so rare, that I never saw above one of them,
which appeared, when sitting, to be about five
feet high, and resembled in figure the Danish
dog<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See plate XXV.</NOTE>; but greatly exceeded him in stature. He
was totally white, and of a mild and peaceable
disposition. We find, then, in all the temperate
climates, as in Britain, France, Germany, Spain,
and Italy, men and dogs of all races. This va∣riety
proceeds partly from the influence of cli∣mate,
and partly from the great concourse and
intermixture of foreigners. With regard to
dogs, I shall mark, with all possible attention,
the similarities and discrepancies which shelter,
care, food, and climate, have produced among
these animals.</P>
<P>The Danish dog<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See plate XXV.</NOTE>, the Irish grey-hound<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See plate XXIV.</NOTE>,
and the common grey-hound<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">See plate XXVI.</NOTE>, though they
appear to be different, are only the same dog.
The Danish dog is but a more corpulent Irish
<PB N="20" REF="26"/>
grey-hound; and the common grey-hound is
the Irish grey-hound rendered thinner and more
delicate by culture; for these three dogs, though
perfectly distinguishable at first sight, differ not
more from each other than a Dutchman, a
Frenchman, and an Italian. If we suppose the
Irish grey-hound to have been a native of France,
he would have produced the Danish dog in a
colder climate, and the common grey-hound in
a warmer one: And this conjecture is even ve∣rified
by experience; for the Danish dogs come
to us from the north, and the grey-hounds from
Constantinople and the Levant. The shepherd's
dog<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See plate XXVII.</NOTE>, the Pomeranian or wolf-dog<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Plate XXVIII.</NOTE>, the Sibe∣rian
dog<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Plate XXIX.</NOTE>, to which may be joined the Lapland
dog, the Canadian dog, the Hottentot dog, and
all those which have erect ears, constitute but
one kind. They differ from the shepherd's dog
only in stature, in being more or less gross, or
in the length, coarseness, or bushiness of their
hair. The hound<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Plate XXXI.</NOTE>, the harrier<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Plate XXXII.</NOTE>, the turnspit<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Plate XXXIV.</NOTE>,
the water-dog<NOTE N="††" PLACE="foot">Plate XXXVI.</NOTE>, and even the spaniel<NOTE N="‡‡" PLACE="foot">Plate XXXVII.</NOTE>, may
be regarded as one dog. Their figure and in∣stincts
are nearly the same; and they differ only
in the length of their legs, and the size of their
ears, which, however, in all of them are long,
soft, and pendulous. These dogs are natives of
France; and I am uncertain whether the Dalma∣tian
<PB N="21" REF="27"/>
dog<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dalmatia, I have been informed, says Mr Pennant, is the country of this elegant dog. As for those of India, they are generally small, and very ugly, or, if the European dogs are brought there, they immediately degenerate. <HI>Synops. of quad.</HI> p. 145.</NOTE>, or, as it is called, the harrier of Ben∣gal,
ought to be disjoined from them; for it
differs from our harrier only in colour. I am
convinced that this dog is not an original native
of Bengal, or of any other part of India, and
that it is not, as has been pretended, the Indian
dog mentioned by the antients, and said to have
been produced between a dog and a tiger; for
it has been known in Italy above 170 years
ago, and not considered as a dog brought
from India, but as a common harrier: 'Canis
sagax, vulgo brachus,' says Aldrovandus, 'an
unius vel varii coloris sit, parum refert; in
Italia eligitur varius et maculosae lynci persi∣milis;
cum tamen niger color, vel albus, aut
fulvus, non sit spernendus<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Aldrovand. quad. digit. lib. 3. p. 552.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>Britain, France, Germany, &amp;c. appear to have
given birth to the hound, the harrier, and the
turnspit: When transported into climates a little
warmer, as Turkey or Persia, these dogs dege∣nerate.
But the spaniels and water-dogs are
natives of Spain and Barbary, where the tem∣perature
of the climate renders the hair of all
animals longer and finer than in any other coun∣try.
The bull-dog<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See plate XLII.</NOTE>, what is improperly called
the small Danish dog, for it has no other resem∣blance
<PB N="22" REF="28"/>
to the Danish dog<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Plate XXV.</NOTE> than the shortness of
its hair, the naked or Turkish dog<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Plate XLI.</NOTE>, and the
Iceland dog<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Plate XXX.</NOTE>, constitute but one race, which,
being transported from cold countries, where the
fur is always strong, into the warmer climates
of Africa and India, have lost their hair; for
the naked dog is improperly called the Turkish
dog: It is not in the temperate climate of Tur∣key
that dogs lose their hair, but in Guiney,
and the warm regions of India. The Turkish
dog is nothing but the small Danish dog, which
has first been transported to a very warm climate,
where it cast its hair, and then afterwards
brought to Turkey, and propagated carefully on
account of its singularity. The first of them,
says Aldrovandus, which appeared in Europe,
were brought into Italy in his own time, where
they could not be propagated, because the cli∣mate
was too cold for them. But, as he gives
no description of these naked dogs, we know
not whether they were similar to what is now
called the Turkish, nor, consequently, whether
they can be referred to the small Danish dog;
because dogs of every kind lose their hair in very
warm climates<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Hist. gen. des Voyages, par. M. l'Abbé Prevost, tom. 4. p. 229.</NOTE>; and, as formerly remarked,
they also lose their voice. In some countries,
they are perfectly mute; in others, they lose
only the faculty of barking, but howl like wolves,
<PB N="23" REF="29"/>
or yelp like foxes. This change seems to make
them approach to their natural state; for both
their figure and instincts are altered: They as∣sume
an ugly aspect, and their ears become erect
and pointed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage de la Böullaye-le Gouz, p. 257.; Voyages de Jean Ovington, tom. I. p. 276.; Histoire universelle des voyages, par du Perrier de Montfrasier, p. 344. et suivantes; Vie de Chri∣stophe Colomb. part. I. p. 106.; Voyage de Bosman en Guinée, &amp;c. p. 240; Histoire generale des voyages, par M. l'Abbé Pre∣vost, tom. IV. p. 229.</NOTE>. It is only in temperate climates
that dogs preserve their ardour, courage, sagacity,
and other talents. They lose every thing, when
transported to very hot countries. But, as if Na∣ture
never made any being perfectly useless, in
climates where dogs cannot serve the purposes for
which we employ them, they are in great request
for the table, and their flesh is preferred by the
Negroes to that of all other animals. They sell
dogs in the market as dear as mutton, venison,
or game of any kind, a roasted dog being the
most luxurious feast to a Negro. Perhaps this
remarkable appetite for dogs flesh is owing to a
change produced in its quality by the heat of the
country; for, in our climates, it is extremely
disagreeable. But I am inclined to think that
this appetite depends more on the nature of man
than that of the dog; for the savages of Canada,
who inhabit a cold country, are equally fond of
dogs flesh with the Negroes; and our missionaries
sometimes eat of it without disgust. P. Sabard
Theodat remarks, 'that dogs are used, as we
<PB N="24" REF="30"/>
use mutton, at feasts. I have several times
been present at these dog-feasts, which at first
struck me with a degree of horror; but, after
tasting it twice, I found that the flesh was good,
and had a flavour somewhat resembling that
of pork<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage au pays des Hurons, par le P. Sabard Theodat, p. 311.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>In our climates, the wolf and fox make the
nearest approach to the dog, particularly to
the shepherd's dog, which I consider as the
original stock of the species: And, as their
internal structure is almost entirely the same,
and their external differences very slight, I
wished to try if they would intermix and pro∣duce
together. I hoped, at least, to make them
copulate; and, if they produced not fertile in∣dividuals,
I expected to procure mules which
would participate of the nature of both animals.
With this view, I reared a she-wolf, taken in
the woods at the age of three months, along
with an Irish grey-hound of the same age. They
were shut up together in a pretty large court, to
which no other beast could have access, and
where they were provided with a shelter for
their retirement. They were equally strangers
to any individual of their own species, and knew
no person but the man who gave them their
victuals. They were kept in this state three
years, without the smallest restraint. During
the first year, they played perpetually, and seem∣ed
to be extremely fond of each other. The
<PB N="25" REF="31"/>
second year they began to quarrel about their
food, though they were supplied in a plentiful
manner. The wolf always began the dispute.
When meat and bones were given them on a
large wooden dish, the wolf, instead of seizing
the meat, instantly drove off the dog, then laid
hold of the edge of the plate so dexterously as
to allow nothing to fall, and carried off the whole.
I have seen her run, in this manner, with the dish
in her teeth, five or six times round the wall,
and never set it down, unless to take breath, to
devour the meat, or to attack the dog, when he
approached. The dog was stronger than the
wolf: But, as he was less ferocious, we began
to be apprehensive for his life, and therefore
furnished him with a collar. After the second
year, these quarrels and combats became more
frequent, and more serious, and a collar was also
given to the wolf, whom the dog now handled
more roughly than before.</P>
<P>During these two years, not the smallest symp∣tom
of desire appeared either in the one or the
other. At the end of the third year, they
began to feel all the ardour of passion; but dis∣covered
no marks of love. This condition, in∣stead
of softening and making them approach
each other, rendered them more untractable and
ferocious. Nothing now was heard but dismal
howlings, and cries of resentment. In three
weeks they were both very meagre; but never
approached but to tear each other. At last they
<PB N="26" REF="32"/>
fought so cruelly that the dog killed the wolf.
The dog was shot some days after, because,
as soon as he was set at liberty, he sprung with
fury upon poultry, dogs, and even men.</P>
<P>I had, at the same time, three young foxes,
two males and a female, which were taken with
nets, and kept in separate apartments. One of
them was secured by a long, light chain, and a
hut was built for sheltering him. I kept him
several months; and, though he had a melan∣choly
air, and kept his eyes fixed upon the fields,
of which he had a view from his hut, yet both
his health and appetite were good. A bitch in
season was presented to him; but, as she would
not remain near the fox, she was chained in the
same place, and both were amply provided with
victuals. The fox neither bit nor maletreated
her. During ten days that they lived together,
there was not the smallest quarrel, neither night
nor day, nor during the time of feeding. The
fox even approached her pretty familiarly; but,
as soon as he had scented her too near, the mark
of desire disappeared, he mournfully return∣ed
to his hut, and no commixture took place.
When the ardour of this bitch was gone, another,
and afterwards a third, and a fourth, were suc∣cessively
presented to him. He treated them
with the same gentleness, and the same indif∣ference.
To ascertain whether this indifference
was owing to a natural repugnance, or to a state
of restraint, he was furnished with a female of
<PB N="27" REF="33"/>
his own species, which he covered more than
once the first day. The female was dissected
some weeks after, and four foetus's were found
in the uterus. The male fox was then let loose
in a close court, and successively furnished with
several bitches in season: He discovered neither
hatred nor love to them; and he died of chagrin
and melancholy a few months afterwards.</P>
<P>From these experiments we learn, that the
wolf and fox are very different in their natures
from the dog; that their species are so distinct
and remote from each other, as to prevent their
commixture, at least in our climates; that, con∣sequently,
the dog derives not his origin from
the wolf or the fox; and that the nomencla∣tors<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Canis cauda sinistrorsum recurvata, <HI>the dog.</HI> Canis cauda incurvata, <HI>the wolf.</HI> Canis cauda recta, apice albo, <HI>the fox. Linn. Syst. p</HI> 59.</NOTE>,
who regard these two animals as wild
dogs, or who imagine the dog to be a wolf or a
fox become domestic, and give the whole three
the common name of <HI>Dog,</HI> have deceived
themselves by not sufficiently studying Nature<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Here the ingenious author seems to have made his conclu∣sion from these experiments too general. For Mr Pennant, in his Synopsis of Quadrupeds, p. 144. records a recent instance of a fertile intercourse between a wolf and a bitch: His words are: 'Mr Brook, animal-merchant in Holborn, turned a wolf to a Pomeranian bitch in heat. The congress was immediate, and as usual between dog and bitch: She produced ten pup∣pies. I have seen one of them that had very much the resem∣blance of the wolf, and much of its nature: Being slipped at a weak deer, it instantly caught at the animal's throat, and killed it.'—It is to be regretted, that Mr Pennant gives no in∣formation as to the fertility or sterility of these mules.</NOTE>.
<PB N="28" REF="34"/>
In warm climates, there is a ferocious animal
which differs less from the dog than the wolf
or fox: This animal, called the <HI>Jackal,</HI> has
been well described by travellers. They are
very numerous in Asia, and Africa, in the neigh∣bourhood
of Trebisond<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyages de Gemell: Carreri, tom. 1. p. 419.</NOTE>, round Mount Cauca∣sus,
in Mingrelia<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Chardin, p. 76.</NOTE>, Natolia<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Dumont, tom. 4. p. 28.</NOTE>, Hyrcania<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Chardin, tom. 2. p. 29.</NOTE>, Per∣sia,

Bengal, Congo<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Bosman, p. 241. 331. Voyage du P. Zuchel, p. 293.</NOTE>, and several other places.
Though this animal is considered by the natives
as a wild dog, yet, as it is doubtful whether they
intermix and produce together, we shall treat of
the jackal, the wolf, and the dog, as separate
and distinct species.</P>
<P>I pretend not absolutely to affirm, that the
jackal, or even the wolf and fox, in no age or
country, never intermixed with dogs. The
contrary is asserted positively by the antients.
Aristotle<NOTE N="††" PLACE="foot">Arist. de generat. animal. lib. 2. cap. 5.</NOTE> remarks, that, though animals of
different species intermingle seldom; yet it cer∣tainly
happens among dogs, foxes, and wolves:
He adds, that the Indian dogs proceed from an∣other
similar wild beast and the dog. This wild
beast, to which he gives no name, is probably
<PB N="29" REF="35"/>
the jackal. But he observes, in another place<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Idem, hist. animal. lib. 8. cap. 28.</NOTE>,
that the Indian dogs proceed from a commix∣ture
between the tiger and the bitch. This no∣tion
is extremely improbable; beeause the tiger,
both in his form and dispositions, differs much
more from the dog than the wolf, the fox, or
the jackal. Aristotle indeed appears to violate
his own argument; for, after telling us, that
the Indian dogs proceeded from a wild beast si∣milar
to the wolf or fox, he says afterwards,
that they proceed from the tiger, without men∣tioning
whether this conjunction was made be∣tween
the tiger and bitch, or between the dog
and tigress: He only adds, that the affair did
not succeed till the third trial; that the first lit∣ter
consisted solely of tigers; that dogs were
chained in the deserts, and, unless the tiger was
in season, they were often devoured; that the
great heat, and scarcity of water, made the pro∣duction
of monsters and prodigies very frequent
in Africa, because numbers of animals were o∣bliged
to assemble in the same place in order to
drink, where they often grew familiar and cou∣pled
together. All this seems to be not only
conjectural and uncertain, but suspicious, and
unworthy of credit; for, the more narrowly we
examine the nature of animals, we perceive that
instinct is the most certain criterion for judging
of them. By the most attentive inspection of
their internal parts, we discovér only slight dif∣ferences.
<PB N="30" REF="36"/>
The horse and ass, though perfectly
similar in their internal structure, are very dif∣ferent
in their natures. The internal parts of
the bull, the ram, and the he-goat, are exactly
the same; yet they constitute three species more
remote from each other than the ass and horse:
The same remark is applicable to the dog; the
fox, and the wolf. We derive more light from
inspecting the external form. But as, in species
which are not remote, there are, even external∣ly,
more resemblances than discrepancies, this
inspection is not sufficient to determine whether
they belong to the same or to different species.
In a word, when the shades are still lighter,
they must be combined with the information
derived from instinct. It is from the dispositions
of animals that we ought to judge of their na∣tures:
If we suppose two animals perfectly si∣milar
in form, but very different in their dispo∣sitions,
they would neither join nor produce to∣gether,
but constitute two distinct species.</P>
<P>This mode of judging concerning the diffe∣rences
of neighbouring species, is the only one
that can be employed when we want to distin∣guish
the numerous varieties which take place
in the same species. We know thirty fixed va∣rieties
of dogs, though we certainly are not ac∣quainted
with the whole. Of these thirty va∣rieties,
there are seventeen which ought to be a∣scribed
to the influence of climate, namely, the
shepherd's dog, the Pomeranian dog, the Sibe∣rian
<PB N="31" REF="37"/>
dog, the Iceland dog, the Lapland dog, the
Irish grey-hound, the common grey-hound, the
mastiff, the great Danish dog, the hound, the har∣rier,
the terrier, the spaniel, the water dog, the
small Danish dog, the Turkish dog, and the
bull-dog. The other thirteen, which are the
mongrel Turkish dog, the grey-hound with hair
like an wolf, the shock-dog, or lap-dog, the
bastard pug-dog, the pug-dog, the Calabrian,
Burgos, and Alicant dogs, the lion-dog, the
small water dog, the dog of Artois, and the
King Charles's dog, are nothing but mongrels
produced by the commixture of the above seven∣teen
races; and, by tracing each of these mon∣grels
back to the two races from which they
sprung, their natures will then be sufficiently a∣scertained.
But, if we want to know the rela∣tions
which subsist between the first seventeen
races, we must attend to their instincts, their
figure, and many other circumstances. I have
put into one group the shepherd's dog, the Po∣meranian
dog, the Siberian dog, the Lapland and
Iceland dogs, because a stronger resemblance
takes place between them than between any of
the other kinds, and because all of them have
sharp muzzles like the fox, erect ears, and an
instinct which induces them to follow and pro∣tect
flocks. The grey-hound, the large Danish
dog, and the Irish grey-hound have, beside their
similarity in figure and length of muzzle, the
same dispositions: They are found of running,
and of following horses and carriages. They
<PB N="32" REF="38"/>
have little scent, and hunt rather by the eye
than the nose. The hounds, the harriers, the
spaniels, the terriers, and the water-dogs, are the
true hunting dogs. Though they differ a little
in figure, they have all thick muzzles, and the
same instincts; and therefore they ought to be
ranked together. The spaniel, for example, has
been called by some naturalists, <HI>canis aviarius
terrestris,</HI> and the water-dog, <HI>canis aviarius aqua∣ticus.</HI>
The only difference in disposition be∣tween
these two dogs is, that the water-dog,
with his long, bushy-hair, takes the water more
chearfully than the others, whose hair is smooth
and short. Lastly, the small Danish dog and the
Turkish dog must be joined together, since the
latter is said to be the same dog with the former,
only deprived of his hair by the effects of heat.
There remains only the bull-dog, which, from
the shortness of his muzzle, resembles the little
Danish dog, but differs from him so much, both
in figure and instinct, as to form a particular
variety. He seems also to affect a particular
climate: He comes from Britain, and it is dif∣ficult
to preserve the breed in France. The
mongrels that proceed from him, which are the
mastiff and the pug-dog, succeed better. All
these dogs have very short muzzles, little scent,
and often send forth a disagreeable smell. The
fineness of scent seems to depend more on the
largeness than the length of the muzzle; for
the grey-hound, the large Danish dog, and the
<PB N="33" REF="39"/>
Irish grey-hound, have less scent than the hound,
the harrier, the tarrier, the spaniel, or the wa∣ter-dog,
who have all, in proportion to their
size, shorter, but broader muzzles, than the for∣mer.</P>
<P>The greater or lesser perfection of the senses
forms not, in man, an eminent or remarkable
quality; but bestows on the other animals all
their merit, and produces, as a cause, all the ta∣lents
of which they are susceptible. I mean not
to enumerate all the qualities of hunting dogs.
The superiority they posses over other animals,
by the excellence and acuteness of their sense of
smelling, is well known. But details of this
kind are remotely connected with natural hi∣story.
Besides, the artifices and dexterity,
though derived solely from nature, employed
by wild animals to conceal themselves, or to a∣void
the pursuit of the dogs, are perhaps more
worthy of admiration than the most refined me∣thodical
exhibitions derived from the art of
hunting.</P>
<P>The dog, like every other animal which pro∣duces
above one or two at a time, is not perfect∣ly
formed immediately after birth. Dogs are
commonly brought forth blind. The two eye∣lids
are not simply glued together, but shut up
with a membrane, which is torn off as soon as
the muscles of the upper eye-lid acquire strength
sufficient to overcome this obstacle to vision,
which generally happens about the tenth or
<PB N="34" REF="40"/>
twelfth day. At this period, the bones of the
head are not completed, the body and muzzle are
turgid, and the whole figure is ill defined. But,
in less than two months, they learn to use all
their senses; their growth is rapid, and they soon
acquire strength. In the fourth month, they
lose some of their teeth, which, as in other ani∣mals,
are soon replaced, and never again fall
out. The number of teeth is forty-two, namely,
six cutting and two canine teeth in each jaw, and
fourteen grinders in the upper and twelve in
the under. But the number of grinders is
not uniform, being greater or less in particular
dogs. When very young, both males and fe∣males
squat down a little to void their urine:
In the ninth or tenth month, they begin to raise
the thigh, when they perform this operation;
and, at the same period, they acquire the capa∣city
of procreating. The male is ready at all
times; but the female receives him only at cer∣tain
fixed seasons, which generally happen
twice a-year, and more frequently in winter
than in summer. The ardour of the female
continues ten, twelve, and sometimes fifteen
days; and it is known by external signs, which
appear some days before she admits the male:
The parts become moist and prominent; and
this phaenomenon is always accompanied with
a small flux of blood. The male discovers the
condition of the female by a peculiar smell; but
she seldom receives him for the first six or seven
<PB N="35" REF="41"/>
days. One embrace is sometimes sufficient to
make her conceivé a great number of young;
but, when not restrained, she will admit several
dogs every day. She seems to have no predi∣lection,
excepting in favour of the largest dogs,
without regarding their figure or beauty. Hence
it frequently happens, that a small female, who
has admitted a large male, dies in bringing forth
her young.</P>
<P>But a singularity in these animals, arising from
the structure of their organs, they are incapable
of separating, after consummation, but are ob∣liged
to remain united as long as the erection
subsists. The dog, like several other animals,
has not only a bone in the penis, but, in the
middle of the corpus cavernosum, there is a large
hollow ring, which, in time of copulation, swells
to a considerable size. The female, on the o∣ther
hand, has a larger clitoris than perhaps any
other animal; besides, in the time of coition, a
large firm protuberance arises, and remains, per∣haps,
longer than that of the male, and prevents
him from retiring till it subsides; for, immedi∣ately
after consummation, he changes his posi∣tion,
in order to repose on his four legs; his a∣spect
is melancholy, and the efforts for separa∣tion
never proceed from the female.</P>
<P>The time of gestation is nine weeks, or 63
days, sometimes 62 or 61, but never less than
60. The females produce six, seven, and some∣times
even twelve puppies. The largest and
<PB N="36" REF="42"/>
tallest are more prolific than the smaller kinds,
which often produce only four or five, and
sometimes but one or two, especially at the first
litters, which, in all animals, are always less nu∣merous
than the subsequent ones.</P>
<P>Dogs, though extremely ardent in their a∣mours,
continue to propagate during life, which
is generally limited to fourteen or fifteen years,
though some have been known to live to the
age of twenty. The duration of life in the dog,
as in other animals, is proportioned to the
time of his growth, which is not comple∣ted
in less than two years, and he lives four∣teen.
His age may be discovered by his teeth,
which, when young, are white, sharp, and point∣ed:
But, as he increases in years, they become
black, blunt, and unequal. It may likewise be
known by the hair, which turns grey on the
muzzle, front, and round the eyes.</P>
<P>These animals, which are naturally vigilant,
active, and frolicksome, by being over-fed in
our houses, become so heavy and slothful, that
they pass their lives in sleeping and eating. Their
sleep, which is almost perpetual, is accompanied
with dreams, which is perhaps a gentle mode of
existing. They are naturally voracious; and yet
they can endure very long abstinence. In the
Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences, we have
the history of a bitch, that, having been forgot
in a country-house, lived forty days, without
any other nourishment than the wool of a ma∣tress,
<PB N="37" REF="43"/>
which she had torn to pieces<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. de l'Acad. des. sciences, année 1706, p. 5.</NOTE> Water
seems to be more necessary to dogs than victuals;
for they drink often and very plentifully: It is
even a vulgar opinion, that, when they want
water too long, they become mad. It is also a
peculiarity in dogs, that they make great efforts,
and seem to suffer much pain, in voiding their
excrement. This happens not, as Aristotle al∣ledges<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Arist. de partibus animal. lib. ult.</NOTE>,
because their intestines become narrow∣er
in approaching the anus. On the contrary,
it is certain, that, in the dog, as in other ani∣mals,
the great intestines enlarge as they proceed
downward, and that the rectum is larger than
the colon. The dry temperament of this ani∣mal,
and not the strangulations of the colon,
which are too distant from the rectum, is suffi∣cient
to produce this effect.</P>
<P>To give a clear idea of the different kinds of
dogs, of their degeneration in particular climates,
and of the mixture of their races, I have sub∣joined
a table, or genealogical tree, in which all
these varieties may be easily distinguished. This
tree is drawn in the form of a geographical
chart, preserving as much as possible the position
of the different climates to which each variety
naturally belongs. The shepherd's dog is the
root of the tree. This dog, when transported
into Lapland, or other very cold climates, as∣sumes
an ugly appearance, and shrinks into a
<PB N="38" REF="44"/>
smaller size. But, in Russia, Iceland, and Si∣beria,
where the climate is less rigorous, and
the people a little more advanced in civilization,
he seems to be better accomplished. These
changes are occasioned solely by the influence
of those climates, which produce no great alte∣ration
in the figure of this dog; for, in each of
these climates, his ears are erect, his hair thick
and long, his aspect wild, and he barks less fre∣quently,
and in a different manner, than in more
favourable climates, where he acquires a finer
polish. The Iceland dog is the only one that
has not his ears entirely erect; for their extre∣mities
are a little inclined; and Iceland, of all
the northern regions, has been longest inhabit∣ed
by half civilized men.</P>
<P>The same shepherd's dog, when brought into
temperate climates, and among a people perfect∣ly
civilized, as Britain, France, Germany, whould,
by the mere influence of the climate, lose his
savage aspect, his erect ears, his rude, thick,
long hair, and assume the figure of a bull-dog,
the hound, and the Irish grey-hound. The bull-dog
and Irish grey-hound have their ears still
partly erect, and very much resemble, both in
their manners and sanguinary temper, the dog
from which they derive their origin. The
hound is farthest removed from the shepherd's
dog; for his ears are long and entirely pendu∣lous.
The gentleness, docility, and even the ti∣midity
of the hound, are proofs of his great de∣generation,
<PB N="39" REF="45"/>
or rather of the great perfection he
has acquired by the long and careful education
bestowed on him by man.</P>
<P>The hound, the harrier, and the terrier, con∣stitute
but one race; for, it has been remarked,
that, in the same litter, hounds, harriers, and
terriers, have been brought forth, though the
female hound had been covered by only one of
these three dogs. I have joined the common
harrier to the Dalmatian dog, or harrier of Ben∣gal,
because they differ only in having more or
fewer spots on their coat. I have also linked
the turnspit, or terrier with crooked legs, with
the common terrier; because the defect in the
legs of the former has originally proceeded from
a disease similar to the rickets, with which some
individuals had been affected, and transmitted
the deformity to their descendants.</P>
<P>The hound, when transported into Spain and
Barbary, where all animals have fine, long,
bushy hair, would be converted into the spaniel
and water-dog. The great and small spaniel,
which differ only in size, when brought into
Britain, have changed their white colour into
black, and become, by the influence of climate,
the great and little King Charles's dog: To these
may be joined the Pyrame<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This dog, though very common in Britain, has no English name.</NOTE>, which is only a
King Charles's dog, black like the others, but
marked with red on the four legs, and a spot of
<PB N="40" REF="46"/>
the same colour above each eye, and on the
muzzle.</P>
<P>The Irish grey-hound, transported to the
north, is become the great Danish dog; and,
when carried to the south, was converted into
the common grey-hound. The largest grey-hounds
come from the Levant, those of a smaller
size from Italy; and those Italian grey-hounds,
carried into Britain, have been still farther dimi∣nished.</P>
<P>The great Danish dog, transported into Ire∣land,
the Ukraine, Tartary, Epirus, and Alba∣nia,
has been changed into the Irish grey-hound,
which is the largest of all dogs.</P>
<P>The bull-dog, transported from Britain to
Denmark, is become the little Danish dog; and
the latter, brought into warm climates, has been
converted into the Turkish dog. All these races,
with their varieties, have been produced by the
influence of cliamte, joined to the effects of
shelter, food, and education. The other dogs
are not pure races, but have proceeded from
commixtures of those already described. I have
marked, in the table, by dotted lines, the double
origin of these mongrels.</P>
<P>The grey-hound, and Irish grey-hound, have
produced the mongrel grey-hound, called also
the grey-hound with wolf's hair. The muzzle
of this mongrel is less pointed than that of the
true grey-hound, which is very rare in France.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="47"/>
The great Danish dog, and the large spaniel,
have produced the Calabrian dog, which is a
beautiful animal, with long bushy hair, and lar∣ger
than the Irish grey-hound.</P>
<P>The spaniel and terrier have produced the dog
called <HI>Burgos.</HI></P>
<P>From the spaniel and little Danish dog, has
proceeded the lion-dog, which is now very rare.</P>
<P>The dogs with long, fine, crisped hair, called
the <HI>Bouffe</HI> dogs, and which are larger than the
water-dog, proceed from the spaniel and water-dog.</P>
<P>The little water-dog comes from the water-dog
and small spaniel.</P>
<P>From the bull-dog and Irish grey-hound, pro∣ceeds
a mongrel called the <HI>mastiff,</HI> which is lar∣ger
than the bull-dog, and resembles the latter
more than the Irish grey-hound.</P>
<P>The pug-dog proceeds from the bull-dog and
small Danish dog.</P>
<P>All these dogs are simple mongrels, and are
produced by the commixture of two pure races.
But there are other dogs, called <HI>double mongrels,</HI>
because they proceed from the junction of a pure
race with a mongrel.</P>
<P>The bastard pug-dog is a double mongrel
from a mixture of the pug-dog with the little
Danish dog.</P>
<P>The Alicant dog is also a double mongrel,
proceeding from the pug-dog and small spaniel.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="48"/>
The Maltese, or lap-dog, is a double mon∣grel,
produced between the small spaniel and
little water-dog.</P>
<P>Lastly, there are dogs which may be called <HI>triple
mongrels,</HI> because they are produced by two mixed
races. Of this kind are the Artois and Islois
dogs, which are produced by the pug-dog and
the bastard pug-dog; to which may be added
the dogs called <HI>street-dogs,</HI> which resemble no
particular kind, because they proceed from races
which have previously been several times mixed.</P>

<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>M. de Mailly, of the academy of Dijon, well
known by several ingenious performances, com∣municated
to me a fact, which merits a place in
the Natural history of the dog. The following
is an extract of his letter upon this subject, dated
October 6. 1772.</P>
<P>"The curate of Norges, near Dijon, had a
bitch, which, without either having ever been
pregnant, or delivered of puppies, had all the
symptoms which characterise these two states.
She came in season at the usual period; but
never had any connections with a male.
When the common term of gestation was fi∣nished,
her paps were distended with milk,
<PB N="43" REF="49"/>
without being irritated by any particular treat∣ment;
for it is possible to bring milk into the
dugs of animals by frequently chaffing them.
But, in this case, every thing was the effect
of nature; and this bitch suckled some young
puppies with which she was furnished, and
for whom she discovered as much tenderness
and attention, as if she had been their real
mother. All this I saw with my eyes. But,
what is still more singular, this same bitch, a∣bout
three years ago, suckled two young cats,
one of which participated so much of the na∣ture
of its nurse, that its cries had more re∣semblance
to the barking of a dog, than to
the mewing of a cat."</P>
<P>If the production of milk, without impregna∣tion,
were more frequent among quadrupeds,
it would make them analogous to female birds,
which lay eggs without the assistance of the
male.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>OF THE VARIETIES OF DOGS.</HEAD>
<P>A few years ago, at the fair of Saint Germain,
there was a Siberian dog, which appeared to dif∣fer
so much from that represented in Plate XXIX.
as to merit a short description. It was covered
with long hair, hanging almost down to the
ground. At first sight, it resembled a large lion-dog;
but its ears were erect, and much larger.
<PB N="44" REF="50"/>
Its colour was all white, and its length, from the
nose to the extremity of the body, was 21 inches
and a half; and its height behind was 11 inches
nine lines, and 11 inches three lines before. The
eye was of a brown chesnut colour, and the end
of the nose, as well as round the nostrils and
mouth, were black. The ears were bushy, of a
whitish yellow within, and yellow on the edges
and extremities. The long hair of its head part∣ly
concealed the eyes, and fell down upon the
nose. Its toes and claws were also hid by the
hair of its legs. The tail, which turned up like
that of the Pomeranian dog, was covered with
hair about seven or eight inches long. This is
certainly the roughest furred of all dogs.</P>
<P>Other dogs, brought to Paris by the Russians,
which they called <HI>Siberian dogs,</HI> belonged to a
very different race from the preceding. Both
male and female were about the size of an ordi∣nary
grey-hound. The nose was sharp, the ears
half erect, but bended a little in the middle.
They were not slender, like the grey-hound,
but round and full below the belly. Their tail
was about eight or nine inches in length, pretty
thick, and obtuse at the extremity. Their co∣lour
was black, without any mixtùre of white
hairs; but the female had a grey tuft on the
middle of the head, and the male a tuft of the
same colour at the end of the tail. They were
troublesome with their caresses, and so voracious
that they could never be satiated. They were,
<PB N="45" REF="51"/>
at the same time, insufferably dirty, and perpe∣tually
roaming about in quest of food. Their
legs were tollerably handsome; but their feet
were large and broad, and their toes united by a
membrane. Their voice was very strong; they
had no inclination to bite; they caressed every
person indiscriminately; and their vivacity was
inexpressible<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Extracted from a letter of M. Pasumot of the academy of Dijon, to M. de Buffon, dated March 2. 1775.</NOTE>. From this description, it appears,
that these pretended Siberian dogs, are of the
same race with that I have called the Iceland dog,
whose figure is engraven Plate XXX. which
exhibits a number of the characters mentioned in
the above delineation.</P>
<P>'I have made some inquiry,' says Mr Colin∣son,
'concerning the dogs of Siberia. Those
which draw sleds and carts are of a middle size:
Their nose is sharp, and their ears long and e∣rect.
They carry their tail bended, some of
them like the wolf, and others like the fox;
and it is certain, that they copulate with wolves
and foxes. I see, from your experiments, that,
when these animals are confined, they will not
intermix; but, when at full liberty, they wil∣lingly
come together. With regard to the dog
and wolf, I myself have seen them couple in
England. But I have never met with any per∣son
who saw dogs and foxes intermingle.
However, from a kind I saw produced from a
bitch, which had lived at freedom in the woods,
<PB N="46" REF="52"/>
I have no doubt that she had been impregnated
by a fox. The peasants know this species, and
distinguish it by the name of the <HI>fox-dogs.</HI>'</P>
<P>Most of the Greenland dogs are white; but
some of them are black, with very bushy hair.
They rather may be said to howl than bark;
and they are stupid, and unfit for every species
of hunting. They serve, however, for dragging
sleds, to which they are yoked by fours and sixes.
The Greenlanders eat the dog's flesh, and make
garments of his skin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. des voyages, tom. 19. p. 39.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The dogs of Kamtschatka are rude, and half
savage, like their masters. They are commonly
black or white, and more nimble and active than
our dogs. They are great eaters of fish, and
are used for drawing sleds. In summer, they
have their liberty; but are collected together in
the month of October, for the purpose of draw∣ing
the sleds; and, during winter, they are fed
with a kind of paste composed of fish, which
is allowed to ferment in a ditch, and given to
them half boiled<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 39.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>From these facts, it appears, that the Green∣land
and Kamtschatkan dogs, and perhaps those
of other northern regions, have a greater resem∣blance
to the Iceland dog, than to any of the o∣ther
races; for the above description of the two
Russian dogs, as well as the notices concerning
those of Greenland and Kamtschatka, correspond
<PB N="47" REF="53"/>
very well, and may be equally applied to our
Iceland dog.</P>
<P>Though we have described all the varieties
which we could collect, there are still some
which could not be procured. For example,
there is a race of wild dogs, of which I have seen
two individuals, but had not an opportunity of
either describing or delineating them. The in∣genious
and learned M. Aubry, curate of Saint
Louis, has often furnished us with animals of
which we had no knowledge. He informs us, that,
a few years ago, he saw a dog, nearly of the size
of a spaniel, which had long hair, and a large
beard on its chin. This dog was produced from
parents of the same race with those which had
formerly been sent ot Lowis XIV. by M. le
Comte de Toulouse. M. le Comte de Lassai had
also some of these dogs; but I know not what
has become of this singular race.</P>
<P>With regard to the wild dogs, among which
there are different races, as well as among the do∣mestic
kinds, I have little to add to what I have
said in my original work. M. le Vicomte de
Querhoënt has been so obliging as to communi∣cate
to me a note with regard to the wild dog
found in the environs of the Cape of Good Hope.
He remarks, 'That, at the Cape, there are nu∣merous
packs of wild dogs, as large as our
largest kinds, whose skin is marked with vari∣ous
colours. They have erect ears, run with
great swiftness, and have no fixed residence.
<PB N="48" REF="54"/>
They destroy an incredible quantity of deer.
They are seldom slain, and very difficult to take
in snares; for they have an aversion to ap∣proach
any thing that has been touched by
man. As their young are sometimes met with
in the woods, attempts have been made to ren∣der
them domestic; but they are so large, and
so ferocious, that these attempts have always
been abortive.'</P>

<HEAD>THE CAT<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The cat has six cutting teeth, and two canine in each jaw; five toes before, and four behind; sharp hooked claws, lodged in a sheath, that may be exerted or drawn in at pleasure; a round head, short visage, and rough tongue. The wild cat has long soft hair, of a yellowish white colour, mixed with grey; the grey is disposed in streaks, pointing downwards, and rising from a dusky list, which runs from head to tail, a∣long the middle of the back; the tail is marked with alternate bars of black and white, and its tip, and the hind part of the legs, are black.

<P>THE cat is an unfaithful domestic, and kept
only from the necessity we find of oppo∣sing
him to other domestics still more incommodi∣ous,
and which cannot be hunted; for we make
no account of those people, who, being fond of
all brutes, foolishly keep cats for their amuse∣ment.
Though these animals, when young, are
frolicksome and beautiful, they possess, at the
<PB N="50" REF="78"/>
same time, an innate malice, and perverse dispo∣sition,
which increase as they grow up, and
which education learns them to conceal, but not
to subdue. From determined robbers, the best
education can only convert them into flattering
thieves; for they have the same address, subtlety
and desire of plunder. Like thieves, they know
how to conceal their steps and their designs, to
watch opportunities, to catch the proper moment
for laying hold of their prey, to fly from pu∣nishment,
and to remain at a distance till sollici∣ted
to return. They easily assume the habits of
society, but never acquire its manners; for they
have only the appearance of attachment or
friendship. This disingenuity of character is
betrayed by the obliquity of their movements,
and the duplicity of their eyes. They never
look their best benefactor in the face; but, ei∣ther
from distrust or falseness, they approach him
by windings, in order to procure caresses, in
which they have no other pleasure than what a∣rises
from flattering those who bestow them.
Very different from that faithful animal the dog,
whose sentiments totally centre in the person and
happiness of his master, the cat appears to have
no feelings which are not interested, to have no
affection that is not conditional, and to carry on
no intercourse with men, but in the view of
turning it to his own advantage. By these dis∣positions,
the cat has a greater relation to man
<PB N="51" REF="79"/>
than to the dog, in whom there is not the smal∣lest
mark of insincerity or unjustice.</P>
<P>The form and temperament of the cat's body
perfectly accord with his temper and dispositions,
He is jolly, nimble, dexterous, cleanly, and vo∣luptuous.
He loves ease, and chooses the soft∣est
and warmest situations for repose. He is
likewise extremely amorous, and, what is singu∣lar
in the animal world, the female seems to be
more ardent than the male. She not only in∣vites
and goes in quest of him, but announces,
by loud cries, the fury of her passion, or rather
the pressure of her necessities; and, when the
male disdains her, or flies from her, she pursues,
tears, and, though their embraces are always ac∣companied
with the most acute pain, compels
him to comply with her desires. This passion∣ate
ardour of the female continues only nine or
ten days, and it happens generally twice a-year,
though often thrice, and even four times. The
period of gestation is 55 or 56 days, and four or
five are commonly produced at a litter. As the
male has an inclination to devour the young, the
female carefully conceals them; and, when ap∣prehensive
of a discovery, she takes them up, one
by one, in her mouth, and hides them in holes,
and in places which are inaccessible. After suck∣ling
them a few weeks, she presents them with
mice, or young birds, to learn them to eat flesh.
But, by an unaccountable caprice, these same
careful, tender, and affectionate mothers, some∣times
<PB N="52" REF="80"/>
assume an unnatural species of cruelty, and
devour their own offspring.</P>
<P>Young cats are gay, vivacious, and frolick∣some,
and, if nothing was to be apprehended
from their claws, would afford excellent amuse∣ment
to children. But their toying, though al∣ways
light and agreeable, is never altogether in∣nocent,
and is soon converted into habitual ma∣lice.
As their talents can only be exerted with
advantage against small animals, they lie in wait,
with great patience and perseverance, to seize
birds, mice, and rats, and, without any instruc∣tion,
become more expert hunters than the best
trained dogs. Naturally averse to every kind
of restraint, they are incapable of any system of
education. It is related, however, that the Greek
Monks of the island of Cyprus had trained cats
to hunt and destroy serpents, with which that
island was much infested<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Descript. des isles de l'Archipel, par Dapper, p. 51.</NOTE>. But this hunting
must rather be ascribed to their general desire
of slaughter, than to any kind of tractability or
obedience; for they delight in watching, attack∣ing,
and destroying all weak animals indiscrimi∣nately,
as birds, young rabbits, hares, rats, mice,
bats, moles, frogs, toads, lizards, and serpents.
They have not that docility and fineness of scent,
for which the dog is so eminently distinguished.
They hunt only by the eye: Neither do they
properly pursue, but lie in wait, and attack ani∣mals
by surprise; and, after sporting with them,
<PB N="53" REF="81"/>
and tormenting them for a long time, they at
last kill them without any necessity, and even
when well fed, purely to gratify their sangui∣nary
appetite.</P>
<P>The most obvious physical cause of their
watching and catching other animals by surprise,
proceeds from the advantage they derive from
the peculiar structure of their eyes. In man
and most other animals, the pupil is capable of a
certain degree of contraction and dilatation. It
enlarges a little when the light is faint, and con∣tracts
when the light is too splendid. But, in
cats and night birds, as the owls, &amp;c. the con∣traction
and dilatation are so great, that the pu∣pil,
which is round in the dark, becomes, when
exposed to much light, long and narrow like a
line. Hence these animals see better in the
night than in the day. The pupil of the cat,
during the day, is perpetually contracted, and
it is only by a strong effort that he can see with
a strong light. But, in the twilight, the pupil
resumes its natural roundness, the animal en∣joys
perfect vision, and takes advantage of this
superiority to discover and surprise his prey.</P>
<P>Though cats live in our houses, they are not
entirely domestic. Even the tamest cats are not
under the smallest subjection, but may rather be
said to enjoy perfect liberty; for they act only
to please themselves; and it is impossible to re∣tain
them a moment after they choose to go off.
Besides, most cats are half wild. They know
<PB N="54" REF="82"/>
not their masters, and only frequent barns, of∣fices,
or kitchens, when pressed with hunger.</P>
<P>Though greater numbers of them are reared
than of dogs, as they are seldom seen, their num∣ber
makes less impression on us. They contract
a stronger attachment to our houses than to our
persons. When carried to the distance of a
league or two, they return of their own accord,
probably because they are acquainted with all
the retreats of the mice, and all the passages and
outlets of the house, and because the labour of
returning is less than that which would be ne∣cessary
to acquire the same knowledge in a new
habitation. They have a natural antipathy at
water, cold, and bad smells. They are fond of
basking in the sun, and of lying in warm places.
They are also fond of perfumes, and willingly
allow themselves to be taken and caressed by
persons who carry aromatic substances. They
are so delighted with valerian root, that it seems
to throw them into a transport of pleasure. To
preserve this plant in our gardens, we are under
the necessity of fencing it round with a rail; for
the cats smell it at a distance, collect about it in
numbers, and, by frequently rubbing, and pas∣sing
and repassing over it, they soon destroy the
plant.</P>
<P>Cats require fifteen or eighteen months before
they come to their full growth. In less than a
year, they are capable of procreating, and re∣tain
this faculty during life, which extends not
<PB N="55" REF="83"/>
beyond nine or ten years. They are, however,
extremely hardy and vivacious, and are more
nervous than other animals which live longer.</P>
<P>Cats eat slowly, and with difficulty: Their
teeth are so short and ill placed, that they can
tear, but not grind their food. Hence they al∣ways
prefer the most tender victuals, as fishes,
which they devour either raw or boiled. They
drink frequently; their sleep is light; and they
often assume the appearance of sleeping, when
they are only meditating mischief. They walk
softly, and without making any noise. As their
hair is always clean and dry, it is easily electri∣fied,
and the sparks become visible when it is
rubbed across with the hand in the dark. Their
eyes also sparkle in the dark like diamonds, and
seem to throw out, in the night, the light they
imbibe during the day.</P>
<P>The wild cat couples with the domestic kind;
and, consequently, they belong to the same spe∣cies.
It is not uncommon to see both males and
females quit their houses in the season of love,
go to the woods in quest of wild cats, and after∣wards
return to their former habitations. It is
for this reason that some domestic cats so per∣fectly
resemble the wild cat. The only real dif∣ference
is internal; for the intestines of the do∣mestic
cat are commonly much longer than those
of the wild cat. The latter, however, is larger
and stronger than the domestic kind; his lips
are always black; his ears are also stiffer; his
<PB N="56" REF="84"/>
tail larger, and his colours more constant. In
this climate there is only one species of wild
cat; and it appears from the testimony of tra∣vellers,
that this kind is found in all climates,
without being subject to much variety. They
existed in America before its discovery by the
Europeans. A hunter brought one of them to
Christopher Columbus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vie de Christ. Columb. part. 2. p. 167.</NOTE>, which was of an ordi∣nary
size, of a brownish grey colour, and having
a very long and strong tail. They were like∣wise
found in Peru<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hist. des Incas, tom. 2. p. 121.</NOTE>, though not in a domestic
state, and also in Canada<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Hist. de Nouvelle France, par Charlevoix, tom. 3. p. 407.</NOTE>, in the country of the
Illinois, &amp;c. They have been seen in many
places of Africa, as in Guiney<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Prevot, tom. 4. p. 230.</NOTE>, and the Gold
Coast; at Madagascar<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Relation de Francois Cauche, p. 225.</NOTE>, where the natives keep
them in a domestic state; and at the Cape of
Good Hope<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Descript. du Cap. par Kolbe, p. 49.</NOTE>, where M. Kolbe says there is
likewise a wild kind, of a blue colour; but they
are not numerous. These blue, or rather slate
coloured cats, are also found in Asia. 'In Persia,'
says Pietro della Valle<NOTE N="††" PLACE="foot">Voyage, tom. 5. p. 98.</NOTE>, 'there is a species of
cats which properly belong to the province of
Chorazan. Their figure and size are the same
with those of the common cat. Their beauty
consists in the colour of their hair, which is
grey, and uniformly the same over the whole
body, excepting that it is darker on the back
<PB N="57" REF="85"/>
and head, and clearer on the breast and belly,
where it approaches to whiteness, with that
agreeable mixture of clare-obscure, to use the
language of the painters, which has always a
wonderful effect. Besides, their hair is fine,
shining, soft as silk, and so long, that, though
not frizled, it forms ringlets in some parts,
and particularly under the throat. These cats
are among other cats, what the water-dog is
among other dogs. The most beautiful part
of the body is the tail, which is very long, and
covered with hair five or six inches in length.
They extend and turn it upon their backs,
like the squirrel, the point resembling a
plume of feathers. They are very tame; and
the Portuguese have brought them from Persia
into India.' The same author adds, that he
had four couple of these cats, which he intend∣ed
to bring to Italy. From this description it
appears, that the Persian cats resemble, in co∣lour,
those we call Chartreux cats, and that, ex∣cepting
in colour, they have a perfect resemblance
to the cat of Angora. It is probable, therefore,
that the cat of Chorazan in Persia, the cat of
Angora in Syria, and the Chartreux cat, consti∣tute
but one race, whose beauty proceeds from the
particular influence of the climate, as the Spanish
cats, which are red, black, and white, owe their
beauty to the climate of Spain. It may be re∣marked
in general, that, of all climates on the
habitable parts of the globe, those of Spain and
<PB N="58" REF="86"/>
Syria are most favourable to the production of
beautiful varieties in natural objects. In Spain
and Syria, the sheep, the goats, the dogs, the
cats, the rabbits, &amp;c. have the finest wool, the
most beautiful and longest hair, and the most a∣greeable
and variegated colours. These climates,
it would appear, soften Nature, and embellish
the form of all animals.</P>
<P>The wild cat, like most other animals in a sa∣vage
state, has coarse colours, and hard hair.
But, when rendered domestic, the hair softens,
the colours vary; and, in the favourable climates
of Chorazan and Syria, the hair grows long,
fine, and bushy; all the colours become more de∣licate;
the black and red change into a shining
brown, and the greyish brown is converted into
an ash-coloured grey. By comparing the wild
cat with the Chartreux cat, it will be found,
that they differ only in this degradation in the
shades of colour. As these animals have al∣ways
more or less whiteness on the sides and
belly, it is apparent, that, to produce cats entire∣ly
white and with long hair, like the cats of An∣gora,
nothing farther is requisite, than to join
those which have the greatest quantity of white,
as has been done to procure white rabbits, dogs,
goats, stags, &amp;c. In the Spanish cat, which is
only another variety of the wild kind, the colours,
instead of being weakened by uniform shades,
as in the cat of Syria, are exalted, and have be∣come
more lively and brilliant; the yellow is
<PB N="59" REF="87"/>
changed into red, the brown into black, and the
grey into white. These cats, though transport∣ed
into America, have not degenerated, but pre∣serve
their beautiful colours. 'In the Antilles,'
says Father Tertre, 'there are a number of cats,
which have probably been brought from Spain.
They are mostly marked with red, white, and
black. Several of our countrymen, after eat∣ing
the flesh, carry the skins of these cats into
France. When we first arrived at Guadaloupe,
the cats were so accustomed to feed on par∣tridges,
pigeons, thrushes, and other small
birds, that they disdained the rats; but, when
the game was much diminished, they attacked
the rats with great fury<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. gen. des Antilles, par. le. P. du Tertre, tom. 2. p. 306.</NOTE>,' &amp;c. In general,
cats are not subject, like dogs, to degeneration,
when transported into warm climates. 'The
European cats,' Bosman remarks, 'when car∣ried
to Guiney, change not, like the dogs, but
preserve their original figure<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Guinée, par Bosman, p. 2403.</NOTE>,' &amp;c. Their
nature is indeed more constant; and, as their do∣mestic
state is neither so complete, so universal,
nor, perhaps, so antient as that of the dog, it is
not surprising that they are also less variegated.
Our domestic cats, though they differ in colour,
form no distinct races. The climates of Spain
and Syria have alone produced permanent varie∣ties:
To these may be added the climate of
Pe-chi-ly in China, where the cats have long
<PB N="60" REF="88"/>
hair and pendulous ears, and are the favourites
of the ladies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. gen. des voyages, par M. l'Abbé Prevot, tom. 6. p. 10.</NOTE>. These domestic cats with pen∣dulous
ears, of which we have full descriptions,
are still farther removed from the wild and pri∣mitive
race, than those whose ears are erect.</P>
<P>We shall here terminate the history of the cat,
and at the same time that of domestic animals.
The horse, the ass, the ox, the sheep, the goat,
the hog, the dog, and the cat, are our only do∣mestic
animals. We add not to this list, the
camel, elephant, rain-deer, &amp;c. which, though
domestic in other countries, are strangers to us;
and we shall not treat of foreign animals, till
we have given the history of the wild animals
which are natives of our own climate. Besides,
as the cat may be considered as only half-do∣mestic,
he forms the shade between domestic and
wild animals; for we ought not to rank among
domestics those troublesome neighbours, mice,
rats, and moles, which, though they inhabit our
houses and gardens, are perfectly wild and free.
Instead of being attached or submissive to man,
they fly from him, and preserve entire, in their
obscure retreats, their manners, their habits, and
their liberty.</P>
<P>We have seen, in the history of each domestic
animal, the great influence which education,
shelter, and the careful hand of man, have upon
the manners, dispositions, and even the form of
<PB N="61" REF="89"/>
animals. We have seen, that these causes, join∣ed
to the effects of climate, modify and change
the species to such a degree, as to make them
very different from what they are in a natural
state, and, at the same time, introduce such
changes among individuals of the same species,
that they would be regarded as different animals,
if they preserved not the faculty of intermixing
and producing fertile individuals, which is the
only essential characteristic of species. We have
seen, that the different races of domestic ani∣mals
observe, in different climates, nearly the
same order as the races of the human kind;
that, like men, they are stronger, larger, and
more courageous in cold countries, milder and
more civilized in temperate climates, and weak∣er
and more deformed in very warm regions;
and that, in temperate climates, and among po∣lished
people, the varieties of each species are
most numerous and diversified, and exhibit the
most evident marks of the antiquity of their sla∣very:
Pendulous ears, variegated colours, fine
long hair, are effects produced by their long
continuance in a domestic state. Most wild a∣nimals
have erect ears. The ears of the wild
boar are erect and stiff; but those of the dome∣stic
hog are inclined and half-pendulous. A∣mong
the Laplanders, the savages of America,
the Hottentots, the Negroes, and other unpolish∣ed
people, all the dogs have erect ears; but they
are generally soft and pendulous in Spain, France,
<PB N="62" REF="90"/>
Britain, Turkey, Persia, China, and other civi∣lized
nations. The ears of the domestic cat are
not so stiff and erect as those of the wild kind;
and in China, a nation which has been very long
in a state of civilization, and whose climate is
mild, there are cats with pendulous ears. It is
for this reason, that the goat of Angora, whose
ears are pendulous, should be regarded as a va∣riety
farthest removed from the natural state.
The strong and marked influence of the climate
of Syria, joined to the domestic condition of
these animals among a people very antiently
civilized, would, in the progress of time, pro∣duce
this variety, which cannot be preserved in
any other climate. In the goats of Angora,
brought forth in France, the ears are neither so
long nor so pendulous as in those of Syria, and
would probably, after a certain number of ge∣nerations,
resume the ears and coarse hair of our
common goat.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="supplement">
<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>By mistaking some of my expressions in the
above history of the cat, I find it has been ima∣gined
that I had denied him the power of sleep∣ing
altogether. I always knew that cats slept,
but not so profoundly as I now find they some∣times
do. On this subject M. Pasumot, of the
<PB N="63" REF="91"/>
academy of Dijon, an able naturalist, communi∣cated
to me a letter, of which the following is
an extract.</P>
<P>'Permit me, Sir, to remark, that, in your
work, you seem to deny the cat the power of
sleeping. I assure you, that, though he sleeps
seldom, his sleep is so profound, that it is a
species of lethargy, which I have observed at
least ten times in different cats. When young,
a favourite cat lay every night in bed at my
feet. One night, I pushed him from me; but
I was surprised to find him so heavy, and at
the same time so immoveable, that I believed
him to be dead. I pulled him smartly with
my hand; but I felt no motion. I then tos∣sed
him about, and, by the force of the agita∣tion,
he began slowly to awake. This pro∣found
sleep, and difficulty of wakening, I have
frequently observed. It generally happened in
the night, having only once observed it in the
day; and this was after perusing what you have
said concerning the sleep of these animals. I
know another gentleman who has likewise of∣ten
seen cats sleeping in this profound manner.
He tells me, that, when cats sleep during the
day, it is always at the time of the greatest
heat, and particularly before the approach of
stormy weather.'</P>
<P>M. de Lestrée, a merchant of Chalons in
Champagne, who is accustomed to allow cats to
lie in his bed, remarks:</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="92"/>
1. 'That, when these animals purr, when
they are tranquil, and appear to be sleeping,
they sometimes make a long inspiration, which
is followed by a strong expiration; and that,
at this period, their breath has an odour which
greatly resembles that of musk.'</P>
<P>2. 'That, when surprised by a dog, or any
other object which suddenly alarms them, they
make a kind of hissing noise, which is accom∣panied
with the same odour. This is not pe∣culiar
to the males; for I have remarked the
same thing of both sexes, and of cats of all ages
and colours.'</P>
<P>From these facts, M. de Lestrée seems to think,
that, in the breast or stomach of the cat, there
are some vessels filled with an aromatic substance,
the perfume of which issues from the mouth.
But we discover nothing of this kind from ana∣tomy.</P>
<P>I formerly remarked, that, in China, there
were cats with pendulous ears. This variety is
not found any where else, and perhaps it is an
animal of a different species; for travellers, when
mentioning an animal called <HI>Sumxu,</HI> which is
entirely domestic, say, that they can compare it
to nothing but the cat, with which it has a great
resemblance. Its colour is black or yellow, and
its hair very bright and glittering. The Chinese
put silver collars about the necks of these ani∣mals,
and render them extremely familiar. As
they are not common, they give a high price,

<P>At Madagascar there are also wild cats ren∣dered
domestic. Most of them have twisted
tails; and they are called <HI>Saca</HI> by the natives.
But these wild cats are of the same species with
the domestic kind; for they intermix and pro∣duce<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Voy. de Fla∣court, p. 152.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Another variety has been observed. In our
own climate, cats are sometimes produced with
pencils of hair at the points of their ears. M.
de Seve writes me, (Nov. 16. 1773), that a young
cat was brought forth in his house at Paris, of
the same race with that we have called the <HI>Spa∣nish
cat,</HI> with pencils at the points of its ears,
though neither of the parents had any pen∣cils.
In a few months, the pencils of this cat
were as large, in proportion to its size, as those
of the Canadian lynx.</P>
<P>The skin of an animal, which greatly resem∣bles
that of our wild cat, has been lately sent me
from Cayenne. It is called <HI>Haïra</HI> in Guiana,
where they eat its flesh, which is white and
good; and hence we may presume, that, how∣ever
similar to the cat, it belongs to a different
species. But, perhaps, the name <HI>haïra</HI> is im∣properly
applied; for it is probably the same
with <HI>taïra,</HI> which is not a cat, but a small mar∣tin,
taken notice of in the last volume of this
work.</P>

<HEAD>OF WILD ANIMALS.</HEAD>
<P>IN the history of man, and of domestic animals,
we have seen Nature under restraint, seldom
persect, often changed and deformed, and per∣petually
encompassed with fetters, or loaded with
foreign ornaments. She is now to appear na∣ked,
and adorned with simplicity alone; but
her attractions will be heightened by native beau∣ty,
by the freedom of her demeanour, the spright∣liness
of her movements, and other marks of
true dignity and independence. We are to see
her traversing the surface of the earth, like a so∣vereign,
dividing her empire among the animals,
assigning to each his proper element, climate,
and subsistence. We shall survey her in the fo∣rests,
in the waters, and in the plains, dictating
her simple but immutable laws, impressing upon
every species indelible characters, dispensing her
bounty with equity, compensating evil with
good, giving to some strength and courage, ac∣companied
with hunger and voracity; to others
gentleness, temperance, and agility, attended
with restlessness and timidity; and to all, liber∣ty,
uniform manners, and ardour in love, which
is always easily gratified, and always followed
with a happy fecundity.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="100"/>
Love and liberty are the most inestimable gifts
which Nature has to bestow. Do these animals
we call <HI>wild,</HI> because they are not subject to our
caprice, require more to render them completely
happy? But they also enjoy a perfect equality;
they are neither the slaves nor the tyrants of each
other. The individual has no occasion, like
man, to dread the rest of his species. They have
peace among themselves, and war never ap∣proaches
them, but from strangers, or from man.
They have, therefore, great reason to fly from
the human race, to conceal themselves from our
observation, to take up their abode in solitudes
remote from the habitations of men, to provide
for their safety by all the resources afforded them
by instinct, and to withdraw themselves from
the power of man, using, in every manner, that
liberty bestowed on them by Nature, at the same
time that she has given them the desire of inde∣pendence.</P>
<P>Some animals, and they are the most gentle,
innocent, and tranquil, content themselves with
retiring, and passing their lives in our fields.
Those which are more fierce and suspicious, hide
themselves in the deepest recesses of the forest.
Others, as if they knew there was no safety on
the surface of the earth, dig subterraneous a∣bodes,
take refuge in caverns, or gain the sum∣mits
of the most inaccessible mountains. Lastly,
the most ferocious and formidable kinds, inha∣bit
only deserts, and reign as monarchs in those
<PB N="68" REF="101"/>
burning climates, where man, equally savage as
themselves, is unable to conquer them.</P>
<P>As all beings, however free, are subjected to
physical laws, and as the brute animals, as well
as man, feel the influences of the heavens and
the earth, it appears, that the same causes which
have softened and civilized the human species in
our climates, have produced similar effects upon
every other species. The wolf, which is per∣haps
the most ferocious animal in the Temperate
Zone, is not nearly so terrible or so cruel as the
tiger, the panther, and the lion of the Torrid
Zone, or the white bear, the lynx, and the hy∣aena
of the Frozen Zone. This difference, as
if Nature, to give more harmony to her produc∣tions,
had adapted the climate to the species,
or the species to the climate, is not only general,
but, in each particular species, the climate is form∣ed
for the manners, and the manners for the
climate.</P>
<P>In America, where the heat, under the same
latitudes, is less, and the air and earth softer than
in Africa, the tiger, the lion, the panther, have
nothing formidable but the name. They are no
longer those tyrants of the forest, those bold and
intrepid enemies of man, those rapacious mon∣sters
which perpetually thirst for blood and car∣nage.
These animals, in America, generally fly
from man, and attack not other wilds beasts with
open force, but lie in wait to surprise them:
They may even be subdued, and almost tamed.
Hence, if ferociousness and cruelty were natural
<PB N="69" REF="102"/>
to them, they must have degenerated, or rather
felt the influence of climate. Under a mild cli∣mate,
their nature has been softened; every ex∣cess
of temper has been moderated; and those
changes have only rendered them more con∣formable
to the quality of the country they in∣habit.</P>
<P>The vegetables which cover the earth, and are
more closely connected with it than the animal
that feeds upon them, participate also more of
the nature of the climate. Every country, every
degree of temperature, has its peculiar plants.
At the foot of the Alps, we find the vegetables
of France and Italy, and, on their summit, those
of the northern regions: We even meet with the
same plants on the frozen ridges of the African
mountains. On the south side of the mountains
which divide the Mogul empire from the king∣dom
of Cashmire, we see all the Indian plants,
and we are surprised to find, on the opposite side,
nothing but the European kinds. Intemperate
climates likewise produce drugs, perfumes, poi∣sons,
and all vegetables whose qualities are high∣ly
exalted. The productions of temperate cli∣mates,
on the contrary, are always mild: The
softest and most wholesome herbs, the sweetest
fruits, the gentlest animals, and the most polish∣ed
men, are peculiar to those happy climates.
Thus, the earth produces plants, the earth and
plants make animals, and the earth, plants, and
animals, give birth to man; for the qualities of
vegetables proceed immediately from the earth
<PB N="70" REF="103"/>
and the air; the temperature and other relative
qualities of herbivorous animals are derived from
the plants upon which they feed; and the phy∣sical
qualities of man, and other creatures which
are nourished partly by flesh and partly by plants,
depend, though more remotely, on the same
causes, whose influence extends even to dispo∣sitions
and manners. Figure and size, which ap∣pear
to be absolute and determined qualities, de∣pend,
however, like the relative qualities, upon
the influence of climate, and concur in proving
that every thing is moderate in temperate re∣gions.
The size of our largest quadrupeds have no
proportion to that of the elephant, the rhinoce∣ros,
or hyppopotamus. Our largest birds are
small, when compared with the ostrich, the con∣dor,
or the cassawary; and what comparison is
there between the fishes, the lizards, and the ser∣pents
of our climates, with the whale, the wal∣rus,
and manati, which people the northern seas,
or the crocodiles, the large lizards, and the enor∣mous
serpents which infest the land and waters
of the south? And, if we examine each species
in different climates, we shall find sensible vari∣eties
both in size and in figure<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the history of the horse, vol. III. p. 306.; goat, vol. III. p. 406.; hog, vol. III. p. 500.; and dog, vol. IV. p. 1.</NOTE>. These chan∣ges
are produced in a slow and imperceptible
manner. Time is the great workman of nature.
He moves with regular and uniform steps. He
performs no operation suddenly; but, by de∣grees,
<PB N="71" REF="104"/>
or successive impressions, nothing can re∣sist
his power; and those changes which at first
are imperceptible, become gradually sensible, and
at last are marked by results too conspicuous to
be misapprehended.</P>
<P>Wild and free animals, without excepting
man, are, of all animated beings, least subject to
changes or variations of any kind. As they are
at absolute liberty in the choice of their food and
their climate, their nature is more permanent
than that of domestic animals, which are enslaved,
transported, maletreated, and fed, without con∣sulting
their inclination or taste. Wild animals
live perpetually in the same manner. They ne∣ver
wander from climate to climate. The wood
where they are brought forth is a country to
which they are faithfully attached, and they ne∣ver
depart from it, unless they perceive that they
can no longer live there in safety. They fly not
so much from their natural enemies, as from the
presence of man. Nature has furnished them
with resources against the other animals, and put
them on a level; they know their strength, their
address, their designs, their haunts, and, if un∣able
to avoid them, oppose force to force: In a
word, they are species of the same genus. But
how can they defend themselves against a being
who can seize without seeing, and kill without
approaching them?</P>
<P>It is man, therefore, who disturbs and disperses
wild animals, and renders them a thousand more
<PB N="72" REF="105"/>
savage than they would naturally be; for most
of them require only tranquility, and a moderate
use of the air and earth. Nature even teaches
them to live together, to unite into families, and
to form societies. In countries not totally en∣grossed
by man, some vestiges of these societies
still remain. We there perceive common works
carried on, designs that, though not founded on
reason, appear to be projected upon rational con∣ventions,
the execution of which supposes union
at least, and a joint co-operation of labour. It is
not by force or physical necessity, like the ants,
the bees, &amp;c. that the beavers labour and build
houses; for they are neither constrained by space,
nor time, nor number, but unite from choice. Those
which agree, dwell together; and those which do
not agree, remove; and some of them have been
remarked which, being constantly repulsed by
others, were obliged to betake themselves to a
solitary life. It is only in distant and desert
countries, where they dread not the approach of
man, that they incline to render their dwellings
more fixed and commodious, by constructing
houses, or a kind of villages, which have no
small resemblance to the feeble and primitive ef∣forts
of a nascent republic. In countries, on
the contrary, spread over by men, they carry
terror along with them. The society of animals
is then at an end. All industry ceases, and eve∣ry
art is stifled. They think no more of build∣ing,
and neglect every conveniency. Perpetu∣ally
<PB N="73" REF="106"/>
pressed by fear and necessity, their only de∣sire
is the bare preservation of life, and their on∣ly
occupation is flight and concealment. If the
human species, as is reasonable to suppose, shall,
in the progress of time, people equally the whole
surface of the earth, the history of the beaver, in
a few ages, will be regarded as a ridiculous
fable.</P>
<P>We may, therefore, conclude, that the talents
and faculties of animals, instead of augmenting,
are perpetually diminishing. Time fights against
them. The more the human species multiplies
and improves, the more will the wild animals
feel the effects of a terrible and absolute tyrant,
who, hardly allowing them an individual exist∣ence,
deprives them of liberty, of every associa∣ting
principle, and destroys the very rudiments of
their intelligence. What advances they have
made, or may still make, conveys little informa∣tion
of what they have been, or might acquire.
If the human species were annihilated, to which
of the animals would the sceptre of the earth
belong?</P>

<P>THE stag is one of those innocent, gentle,
and peaceable animals, which seem to be
destined to embellish and animate the solitudes
of the forest, and to occupy, at a distance from
man, the tranquil retreats of those gardens
of nature. The elegance and lightness of his
<PB N="75" REF="108"/>
figure, the commodiousness of his stature, the
flexibility and nervousness of his limbs, his gran∣deur,
strength, and swiftness, and his head, which
is rather adorned than armed with living bran∣ches,
that, like the leaves of trees, are annually
renewed, sufficiently distinguish him from the o∣ther
inhabitants of the wood. As he is also the
noblest of these animals, he ministers to the plea∣sure,
and has occupied the leisure, of the great∣est
heroes. The exercise of the chace should
always succeed, or rather precede, the fatigues
of war. To know the management of horses
and arms, are talents common to the warrior
and the hunter. To be accustomed to fatigue,
address, dexterity, and quickness of movement,
so necessary for the support of courage, are qua∣lities
acquired in the chace, and extremely use∣ful
in battle. Hunting is a most delightful
school of a necessary art. It is the only amuse∣ment
which entirely divests us of care, the only
recreation that is not accompanied with effemi∣nacy,
and gives vivacity and pleasure, without
languor or disgust.</P>
<P>How can men, who, from their situation in
life, are perpetually harrassed with company, be
better employed than in hunting? Always sur∣rounded
with a multitude, teased with the im∣portunity
of their demands, obliged to give their
attention to affairs which are foreign to them,
agitated by the solicitations of men of high rank,
and constrained and fettered in proportion to
<PB N="76" REF="109"/>
their elevation, great men would feel only the
weight of their own grandeur, and exist only
for others, if they did not occasionally abstract
themselves from a croud of parasites and flatter∣ers.
To preserve self-enjoyment, to recal per∣sonal
attachments, and receive private friend∣ship,
sentiments a thousand times more precious
and interesting than all the ideas of grandeur,
retirement from the tumult and business of the
world is sometimes necessary; and what retire∣ment
can be more various and animated than the
chace? what exercise more useful to the body?
what amusement more agreeable to the mind?</P>
<P>Perpetual action, or intercourse with man, is
equally painful as perpetual thinking. Nature
never intended man for the contemplation of
abstract subjects. To be occupied, without re∣laxation,
in difficult studies, to lead a sedentary
life, and to make the closet the centre of our ex∣istence,
is equally unnatural as to pass our days
in tumult and agitation, continually drawn along
by the movements of other men, and obliged to
keep a jealous and constrained watch over our
own conduct, looks, and gestures. Whatever
ideas we may conceive of the dignity of human
nature, it is apparent, that public exhibition is
not existence, and that we are less fitted for
thinking than for action, for reasoning than en∣joyment.
True pleasure consists in the unre∣strained
use of ourselves. Our best gifts are
those we receive from Nature. She presents us
<PB N="77" REF="110"/>
with the useful and inexhaustible enjoyments
which arise from the air, the earth, the fields,
and the forests. Hence a taste for hunting,
fishing, gardening, and agriculture, is natural to
all men: And, in societies less complicated than
ours, there are only two ranks, both of them
connected with this mode of life; the Nobles,
whose business is arms and hunting; and the
Vulgar, who are occupied in cultivating the
earth.</P>
<P>In polished societies, where every thing is im∣proved
and brought nearer perfection, to render
hunting more delightful and sprightly, to ennoble
this most beneficial and respectable of all exer∣cises,
it has been formed into an art. The chace
of the stag requires a species of knowledge,
which can only be learned by experience: It
implies a royal assemblage of men, horses, and
dogs, all so trained, practised, and disciplined,
that their movements, their researches, and their
skill, must concur in producing one common
end. The huntsman should know the age and
the sex of the animal; he should be able to di∣stinguish
with precision, whether the stag he
has <HI>harboured</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>To harbour</HI> a stag, is to go round the place in which he has taken refuge, and to learn whether he has not escaped.</NOTE> with his hound be a <HI>knobber</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Knobber</HI> is a stag after he passes his first year till he arrives at the third.</NOTE>,
a young stag<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">In the third, fourth, or fifth year of his age.</NOTE>, in his sixth or seventh year, or
<PB N="78" REF="111"/>
and old stag<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A stag is said to be <HI>old</HI> from eight years and upwards.</NOTE>. The chief marks which convey
this intelligence is derived from the <HI>foot</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Foot</HI> is used for the impression made on the ground by the foot.</NOTE>, and
the excrement. The <HI>foot</HI> of the stag is better
formed than that of the hind, or female. Her
<HI>leg</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">In the language of hunters, <HI>leg</HI> means the two bones be∣hind the foot, which make an impression on the ground along with the foot.</NOTE> is more gross and nearer the heel. The
impressions of his feet are rounder, and farther
removed from each other. He moves more re∣gularly,
and brings the hind foot into the im∣pression
made by the fore foot. But the di∣stance
between the steps of the hind are shorter,
and her hind feet strike not so regularly the
track of the fore feet. As soon as the stag ac∣quires
his fourth horns, he is easily distinguish∣ed;
but, to know the <HI>foot</HI> of a young stag from
that of a hind, requires repeated experience.
Stags of six, seven, &amp;c. years, are still more
easily known; for their fore foot is much lar∣ger
than the hind foot; the older they are, the
sides of their feet are the more worn<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">This mark is equivocal; for the wearing of the hoof de∣pends much on the plainness or roughness of the country which the animals frequent.</NOTE>; the
distance of their steps are more regular than
those of young stags; they always place their
hind foot exactly in the track of the fore foot,
excepting, when they shed their horns, the old
<PB N="79" REF="112"/>
stags <HI>misplace</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>To misplace,</HI> is to put the hind foot out of the track of the fore foot.</NOTE>, at this season, nearly as often
as the young ones; but in this they are more
regular than the hind or young stag, placing the
hind foot always at the side of the fore foot,
and never beyond or within it.</P>
<P>When the huntsman, from the dryness of the
season, or other circumstances, cannot judge by
the foot, he is obliged to trace the animal back∣wards,
and endeavour to find his dung. This
mark requires, perhaps, greater experience than
the knowledge of the foot; but, without it, the
huntsman would be unable to give a proper re∣port
to the company. After the report of the
huntsman, and the dogs are led to the refuge of the
stag, he ought to encourage his hound, and make
him rest upon the track of the stag till the animal
be unharboured. Instantly the alarm is given to
uncouple the dogs, which ought to be enlivened
by the voice and the horn of the huntsman. He
should also diligently observe the foot of the stag,
in order to discover whether the animal has
started, and substituted another in his place. But
it is then the business of the hunters to sepa∣rate
also, and to recall the dogs which have gone
astray after false game. The huntsman should
always accompany his dogs, and encourage, with∣out
pressing them too hard. He should assist
them in detecting all the arts of escape used
by the stag; for this animal has remarkable
<PB N="80" REF="113"/>
address in deceiving the dogs. With this view,
he often returns twice or thrice upon his former
steps; he endeavours to raise hinds or younger
stags to accompany him, and draw off the dogs
from the object of their pursuit: He then flies
with redoubled speed, or springs off at side, lies
down on his belly, and conceals himself. In
this case, when the dogs have lost his foot, the
huntsmen, by going backwards and forwards,
assist them in recovering it. But, if they cannot
find it, they suppose that he is resting within
the circuit they have made, and go in quest of
him. But, if they are still unable to discover him,
there is no other method left, but, from view∣ing
the country, to conjecture where he may
have taken refuge, and repair to the place. As
soon as they have recovered his foot, and put the
dogs upon the track, they pursue with more ad∣vantage,
because they perceive that the stag is
fatigued. Their ardour augments in proportion
to his feebleness; and their scent becomes more
distinct as the animal grows warm. Hence they
redouble their cries and their speed; and, though
the stag practises still more arts of escape than
formerly, as his swiftness is diminished, his arts
and doublings become gradually less effectual.
He has now no other resource but to fly from
the earth which he treads, and get into the waters,
in order to cut off the scent from the dogs. The
huntsmen go round these waters, and again put
the dogs on the track of his foot. The stag, af∣ter
<PB N="81" REF="114"/>
taking to the water, is incapable of running
far, and is soon <HI>at bay</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When a stag is worn out with fatigue, he turns upon the hounds, and is said to be <HI>at bay.</HI></NOTE> But he still attempts
to defend his life, and often wounds the dogs,
and even the huntsmen when too forward, by
blows with his horns, till one of them cuts his
hams to make him fall, and then puts an end to
his life by a blow of a hanger. They now ce∣lebrate
the death of the stag by a flourish of their
horns; the dogs are allowed to trample upon
him, and at last partake richly of the victory by
devouring his flesh.</P>
<P>Every season is not equally proper for hunt∣ing
the stag with hounds. In spring, when the
leaves begin to unfold and to adorn the forests,
when the earth is covered with fresh herbage
and flowers, their perfumes diminish the sensa∣tion
of the dogs; and, as the stag is then in his
greatest vigour, it is extremely difficult for them
to come up with him. It is likewise a settled
point among hunters, that, when the hinds are
about to bring forth, the chace is most difficult,
and that, at this period, the dogs often quit a fa∣tigued
stag, and pursue any hind which bounds
before them. In the same manner, in the begin∣ning
of autumn, when the rutting season commen∣ces,
the hounds hunt without ardour: The strong
odour of love renders, perhaps, the scent more un∣interesting;
and, perhaps, at this season, the odour
of all stags is nearly the same. During the winter
<PB N="82" REF="115"/>
snows, it is also improper to hunt the stag; be∣cause
the hounds have no acuteness of scent, and
seem to pursue the foot rather by the eye than
the nose. As, in this season, the stags find not
sufficient nourishment in their retreats, they is∣sue
forth into the more open parts of the coun∣try,
and even into the sown fields. They as∣semble
in flocks in the month of December, and,
when the frosts are severe, they seek shelter on
the sea-coasts, or in covered places, where they
lock themselves fast together, and acquire warmth
by mutual respiration. When the rigours of
winter decline, they frequent the borders of the
forest, and make depredations on the rising
wheat. In spring, they shed their horns, which
fall off spontaneously, or by rubbing them gently
against the branches of trees. It is seldom that
both horns fall off at the same time, the one ge∣nerally
preceding the other a day or two. The
old stags cast their horns first, which happens a∣bout
the end of February or beginning of March.
An aged stag, or one in his seventh year or up∣wards,
does not cast his horns before the middle
of March; a stag of six years sheds his horns
in April; young stags, or those from three to
five years old, shed their horns in the beginning,
and those which are in their second year, not till
the middle or end of May. But, in all this there
is much variety; for old stags sometimes cast
their horns sooner than those which are young∣er.
Besides, the shedding of the horns is ad∣vanced
<PB N="83" REF="116"/>
by a mild, and retarded by a severe and
long winter.</P>
<P>As soon as the stags cast their horns, they se∣parate
from each other, the young ones only
keeping together. They no longer haunt the
deepest recesses of the forest, but advance in∣to
the cultivated country, and remain among
brushwood during the summer, till their horns
are renewed. In this season, they walk with
their heads low to prevent their horns from
rubbing against the branches; for they con∣tinue
to have sensibility till they acquire their
full growth. The horns of the oldest stags are
not half completed in the middle of May, and
acquire their full length and hardness before the
end of July. Those of the younger stags are
proportionally later both in shedding and being
renewed. But, as soon as they have acquired
their full dimensions and solidity, the stags rub
them against the trees, in order to clear them of
a skin with which they are covered: And, as
they continue this friction for several days suc∣cessively,
it is said<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Le nouveau traité de la venerie, p. 27.</NOTE>, that the horns retain the
colour peculiar to the juices of the trees against
which they have been rubbed; that they become
red when rubbed against beeches and birches,
brown against oaks, and black against elms and
trembling poplars. It is likewise said, that the
horns of young stags, which are smoother, take
not so deep a tincture from the trees as those of
<PB N="84" REF="117"/>
old stags, which are rougher, and closer cover∣ed
with little prominences; because it is those
prominences which retain the coloured juices of
the trees. But I cannot believe that this is the
true cause; for I have kept tamed stags in an
inclosure where there was not a single tree, and
yet their horns were coloured in the same man∣ner
as in those which inhabit the forests.</P>
<P>Soon after the stags have polished their horns,
they begin to feel the impressions of love. To∣wards
the end of August or beginning of Sep∣tember,
they leave the coppice, return to the
forests, and search for the hinds. They cry with
a loud voice; their neck and throat swell; they
become perfectly restless, and traverse, in open
day, the fields and the fallow grounds; they
strike their horns against trees and hedges; in a
word, they seem to be transported with fury, and
run from country to country till they find the
hinds or females, whom they pursue and compel
into compliance; for the female at first avoids
and flies from the male, and never submits to his
embraces till she be fatigued with the pursuit.
The old hinds likewise come in season before the
younger ones. When two stags approach the
same hind, they must fight before they enjoy.
If nearly equal in strength, they threaten, paw
the ground, set up terrible cries, and attack each
other with such fury, that they often inflict mortal
wounds with the strokes of their horns. The
combat never terminates but in the defeat or
<PB N="85" REF="118"/>
flight of one of the rivals. The conqueror
loses not a moment in enjoying his victory, un∣less
another rival approaches, whom he is again
obliged to attack and repel. The oldest stags
are always masters of the field; because they are
stronger and more furious than the young ones,
who must wait patiently till their superiors tire,
and quit their mistresses. Sometimes, however,
the young stags accomplish their purposes when
the old ones are fighting, and, after a hasty gra∣tification,
fly off. The hinds prefer the old stags,
not because they are most courageous, but be∣cause
they are much more ardent. They are
likewise more inconstant, having often several
females at a time; and, when a stag has but one
hind, his attachment to her does not continue
above a few days: He then leaves her, goes in
quest of another, with whom he remains a still
shorter time; and, in this manner, passes from
one to another, till he is perfectly exhausted.</P>
<P>This ardour of love lasts only three weeks,
during which the stags take very little food, and
neither sleep nor rest. Night and day, they are
either walking, running, fighting, or enjoying
the hinds. Hence, at the end of the rutting
season, they are so meagre and exhausted, that
they recover not their strength for a considerable
time. They generally retire to the borders of
the forests, feed upon the cultivated fields, where
they find plenty of nourishment, and remain
there till their strength is re-established. The
<PB N="86" REF="119"/>
rutting season of old stags commences about
the beginning, and ends about the 20th day
of September. In those of six or seven years
old, it begins about the 10th of Septem∣ber,
and concludes in the beginning of Octo∣ber.
In young stags, or those in their third,
fourth, or fifth year, it begins about the 20th of
September, and terminates about the 15th of
October; and, at the end of October, the rut∣ting
is all over, excepting among the <HI>prickets,</HI> or
those which have entered into their second year;
because they, like the young hinds, are latest of
coming into season. Hence, at the beginning
of November, the season of love is entirely finish∣ed;
and the stags, during this period of weak∣ness
and lassitude, are easily hunted down. In
seasons when acorns and other nuts are plenti∣ful,
the stags soon recover their strength, and a
second rutting frequently happens at the end of
October; but it is of much shorter duration than
the first.</P>
<P>In climates warmer than that of France, the
rutting time, like the seasons, is more forward.
Aristotle informs us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aristot. Hist. animal. lib. 6. c. 29.</NOTE>, that, in Greece, it com∣mences
in the beginning of August, and termi∣nates
about the end of September. The hinds
go with young eight months and some days,
and seldom produce more than one fawn. They
bring forth in May or the beginning of June,
and so anxiously conceal their fawns, that they
often expose themselves to be chaced, with a
<PB N="87" REF="120"/>
view to draw off the dogs, and afterwards return
to take care of their young. All hinds are not
fertile; for some of them never conceive. These
barren hinds are grosser and fatter than those
which are prolific, and also come soonest in sea∣son.
Some hinds are said to have horns like
the stag, which is not altogether improbable.
The young are not called <HI>fawns</HI> or <HI>calves</HI> after
the sixth month: The knobs of their horns then
begin to appear, and they take the name of
<HI>knobbers</HI> till their horns lengthen into <HI>spears,</HI> and
then they are called <HI>brocks</HI> or <HI>staggards.</HI> During
the first season, they never leave their mothers.
In winter, the stags and hinds, of all ages, keep
together in flocks, which are always more nu∣merous
in proportion to the rigour of the season.
They separate in spring: The hinds retire to
bring forth; and, during this period, the flocks
consist only of knobbers and young stags. In
general, the stags are inclined to associate, and
nothing but fear or necessity obliges them to
disperse. The stag is capable of generating at
the age of eighteen months: Those brought
forth during the spring of the preceding year,
cover the hinds in autumn; and it is presume∣able
that these embraces are prolific. The fol∣lowing
circumstances, however, may render this
opinion doubtful: The stags have not then ac∣quired
above a half or two thirds of their growth,
which is not completed till the eighth year of
their age; and their horns continue to increase
<PB N="88" REF="121"/>
during the same period. But it ought to be re∣marked,
that the fawn soon gathers strength;
that, during the first, and even the second year,
his growth is very quick; and that he has al∣ready
a redundance of nourishment, because his
horns are considerably long, which is the most
certain mark of ability to impregnate. It is al∣lowed,
that animals, in general, are not capable
of procreating till they have nearly acquired
their full growth. But those which have fixed
seasons for rutting or spawning, seem not to ob∣serve
this law. Fishes spawn and are prolific be∣fore
they have attained a fourth, or even an
eighth part of their growth; and, among qua∣drupeds,
those which, like the deer-hind, have
determined seasons for rutting, procreate earlier
than other animals.</P>
<P>There are so many relations between the nu∣trition,
the production of the horns, the rutting,
and the generation of these animals, that, to have
a clear conception of the particular effects which
result from them, it is necessary to give a gene∣ral
recapitulation of what I formerly advanced
on the subject of reproduction<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See above, vol. II. chap. 2. 3. 4.</NOTE>. Generation
depends solely on a redundance of nourishment.
During the growth of an animal, which is al∣ways
most rapid in infancy, the nourishment is
entirely exhausted in the extension and deve∣lopement
of the body. Hence there is no re∣dundance,
consequently no production or secre∣tion
<PB N="89" REF="122"/>
of seminal fluid, and, of course, young ani∣mals
are incapable of procreation. But, when
they have attained the greatest part of their
growth, the redundance of nourishment begins
to manifest itself by new productions. In man,
the beard, the hair, the prominency of the breasts,
and the expansion of the organs of generation,
appear at the age of puberty. In the brute cre∣ation;
and particularly in the stag, this redun∣dance
produces effects still more remarkable, as
the growth of the horns, the swelling of the testi∣cles,
the turgidity of the neck and throat, the fat,
the rutting, &amp;c. And, as the growth of the stag
is at first very rapid, only a year passes before the
redundance of nourishment begins to show itself
by the production of horns: If brought forth
in May, the rudiments of the horns appear in
the same month of the following year; and they
continue to lengthen and acquire solidity, in pro∣portion
to the quantity of nourishment taken by
the animal. About the end of August, they are
fully grown, and so dense and insensible, that
the animal rubs them against the trees, in order
to deprive them of the skin or scurf with which
they are covered. At the same time, the fat,
which is likewise produced by the redundance of
nourishment, ceases to accumulate, and begins
to be determined toward the organs of genera∣tion,
and to excite in the stag that ardour of de∣sire
which renders him perfectly furious. That
the production of horns, and the secretion of
semen depend on the same cause, is evident
<PB N="90" REF="123"/>
from this fact, that, when the organs neces∣sary
for the secretion of semen are destroy∣ed
by castration, the production of the horns
is likewise prevented; for, if this operation
is performed after the horns are shed, they
are never renewed; and if, on the contrary,
it is done when the horns are perfect, they
never fall off. In a word, after castration, the
animal remains during life in the same condition
it was before that operation. As it feels no
longer the ardour of rutting, the concomitant
symptoms likewise disappear. There is no long∣er
any accumulation of fat or suet, no more
turgidity of the neck and throat, and the dispo∣sition
of the creature becomes more gentle and
tranquil. The parts cut off, therefore, were ne∣cessary,
not only for collecting the redundant
nourishment, but likewise for pushing it to the
surface of the body in the form of fat, and
particularly to the top of the head, where it
gives rise to the horns, and for giving vigour
and spirit to the animal. Castrated stags, it is
true, become fat; but they produce no horns;
their neck and throat never swell; and their fat
is never so highly exalted as that of entire stags,
which, in the rutting season, have an odour so
strong, as to be perceived at a great distance;
and their flesh is so infected with it, that it is un∣eatable,
offensive to the smell, and putrifies in a
very short time; while that of the castrated stag
may be preserved fresh, and eat at all seasons.
The difference between the horns of stags of the
<PB N="91" REF="124"/>
same age, of which some are thick, and others
thin and slender, which is solely owing to a de∣fect
of food, is another proof that the horns are
produced by redundant nourishment: For a stag
which inhabits a rich country, where he is not
disturbed by dogs or men, but is allowed to feed
and ruminate in peace, will always have the high∣est,
widest, largest, and most branchy horns.
But those which live in situations where they
can neither find repose nor a sufficient quantity
of food, will have horns with few branches,
slender stems, and brow-antlers. Thus it is
easy to judge, by the horns of the stag, whether
he has lived in a rich and peaceful country, or
the opposite. Those which are in bad condi∣tion,
have been wounded, or much disturbed by
hunting, are seldom fat, or have fine horns;
their rutting time is also later; and their horns
are neither so soon shed or renewed. Hence
every circumstance concurs in demonstrating
that the horns, like the seminal fluid, are no∣thing
but the redundant and superfluous organic
nourishment, which could not be exhausted in
expanding and supporting the animal body.</P>
<P>It is, therefore, apparent, that penury of food
both retards the growth and diminishes the size
of the horns; and, perhaps, it is not impossible,
by retrenching the quantity of food, to suppress
entirely this production, without having recourse
to castration. It is, however, certain, that castra∣ted
stags eat less food than those which are un∣mutilated;
and the females of this species, as
<PB N="92" REF="125"/>
well as those of the fallow-deer, the roe, and the
elk, have no horns, because they eat less than
the males; and because, at the very time that a
redundance of nourishment would naturally hap∣pen,
they are with young, and, instead of show∣ing
itself externally, it is first exhausted in nou∣rishing
the foetus, and afterwards in nourishing
the fawn. The objection, that the female rain-deer,
which has horns like the male, rather sup∣ports
than weakens this argument; for, of all
horned animals, the rain-deer, in proportion to
his size, has the largest and most voluminous
horns, often extending, before and behind, the
whole length of the body. He likewise abounds
most in fat<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">La Veneric de du Foilloux, p. 97.</NOTE>; and, besides, the horns of the female
are much smaller than those of the male. This
example, therefore, proves no more than that,
when the redundance is so great as not to be ex∣hausted
by gestation and the growth of the foe∣tus,
it breaks through the body, and forms a new
production, as in the male, only smaller in size,
because the quantity of redundant matter is less.</P>
<P>What I have remarked concerning nourish∣ment
ought not to be extended to the mass or
volume of the aliments, but only to the quanti∣ty
of organic particles, that living, active, and
prolific matter which unfolds and supports all a∣nimated
beings. The rest is nothing but dregs,
which may be more or less in quantity, without
inducing any change upon the body: And, as the
<PB N="93" REF="126"/>
lichen rangiferinus, or rain-deer liverwort, is the
ordinary food of the rain-deer, and is more substan∣tial
than the leaves, the bark, or the buds of trees,
it is not surprising, that this animal should have
a greater redundance of organic particles, and,
consequently, larger horns, and more fat, than
the common stag. It must be acknowledged,
however, that the organic matter which produ∣ces
the horns is not perfectly disengaged from
useless particles, and that it preserves, after pas∣sing
the body of the animal, marks of its former
vegetable state. The horns of the stag shoot,
grow, and are disposed like the branches of a
tree. Its substance is, perhaps, less osseous than
lignous. To use the expression, it is a vegetable
grafted upon an animal, participating of the na∣ture
of both, and forming one of those shades by
which nature always bounds the extremities of
her productions, and which she employs to con∣nect
substances that are greatly removed from
each other.</P>
<P>In the animal, as formerly remarked<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See above, vol. II. art. <HI>Of Old age and Death.</HI></NOTE>, both
extremities of the bones grow at a time. The ful∣crum
upon which the extending power is exerted,
is in the middle of the bone, which part is always
first ossified, and from which the two extremes
progressively recede, and continue soft till the
bone acquires its full length. In the vegetable,
on the contrary, only one extremity of the wood
grows. The bud, which unfolds to form a
<PB N="94" REF="127"/>
branch, is attached to the old wood by its infe∣rior
extremity, and upon this fulcrum the power
of longitudinal extension acts. This remark∣able
difference between the vegetation of bones
and the solid parts of plants, does not take place
in the horns of stags. On the contrary, nothing
can be more similar to the growth of a tree.
The horns extend at one extremity only, the o∣ther
serving for a fulcrum. They are first tender
as an herb, and then harden like wood. The
skin which covers and grows along with them is
their bark, and it is rubbed off after they attain
their full size. As long as they continue to grow,
their extremities are soft; and they likewise di∣vide
into several branches. In a word, every
circumstance is similar, and corresponds in the
developement of both. Hence the organic par∣ticles,
which constitute the living substance of the
stag, still retain the impression of the vegetable;
because they arrange themselves in the same or∣der
as the parts of plants. Here it is apparent,
that matter has an influence upon form. The
stag which inhabits the forest, and feeds only on
the sprigs of trees, takes so strong an impression
from the wood, that he produces a species of
tree, which preserves indelible and evident marks
of its origin. This effect, though singular, is not
solitary, and depends on a general cause, which I
have already pointed out.</P>
<P>Both in animals and vegetables, the character,
or mould, of each species, is the most constant
<PB N="95" REF="128"/>
and unalterable thing in Nature: What is most
variable and desultory, is the matter of which they
are composed. Matter, in general, seems to be
indifferent to all forms, and capable of receiving
every possible impression. The organic or li∣ving
particles of this matter pass from vegetables
to animals, without destruction or alteration, and
form equally the living substance of the herb, of
the wood, of the flesh, and of the bones. Ac∣cording
to this view, it appears that matter can
never have any influence on form, and that
no kind of food, provided the animal can ex∣tract
the organic particles, and assimilate them by
nutrition, could induce any change upon the form,
or have any other effect than to support and ex∣pand
the body, by modelling itself upon all the
particles of the interior mould, and intimately
penetrating them. What proves this point is,
that animals which live upon herbage, a sub∣stance
very different from that of their own
bodies, extract from it materials sufficient for
the production of flesh and blood, and that they
are nourished and grow as well as animals who
feed upon flesh alone. However, by examining
Nature more minutely, we shall find, that these
organic particles sometimes do not perfectly assi∣milate
themselves to the internal mould, and that
matter has often a sensible influence upon form.
Size, for example, which is one of the attributes
of form, varies in every species, according to the
difference of climate. The quality and quantity
<PB N="96" REF="129"/>
of flesh, two other attributes of form, change ac∣cording
to the difference of food. This organic
matter, therefore, which the animal assimilates
to its own body by nutrition, is not absolutely
indifferent to the reception of every form, nor
deprived of the original figure which it possessed.
It retains some characters of its primitive state.
It acts, therefore, by its proper form upon that
of the organized body to which it affords nou∣rishment;
and, though this action is almost im∣perceptible,
and infinitely inferior to the power
which obliges the organic particles to assimilate
themselves to the internal mould that receives
them, yet, in the progress of time, sensible ef∣fects
must result from it. The stag, who inha∣bits
the forests, and lives solely upon wood, pro∣duces
and carries about with him a species of
trees, which is nothing but the redundant part
of his nourishment. The beaver, who lives in
the waters, and feeds upon fishes, has a tail co∣vered
with scales. The flesh of the otter, and of
most water fowls, is a lent diet, a kind of fishy
flesh. We may, therefore, presume, that animals
perpetually nourished by the same food, howe∣ver
strong the original impression of nature,
would, in process of time, acquire a tincture from
the qualities of this food, and undergo a kind of
transformation, by an assimilation contrary to
the first. The nourishment would no longer as∣similate
itself entirely to the form of the animal,
but the animal would partly assimilate itself to
<PB N="97" REF="130"/>
the form of the nourishment, as we perceive in
the horns of the stag and the tail of the beaver.</P>
<P>In the stag, the horns are an accessory, a part
foreign to the animal, and only regarded as be∣longing
to him, because it proceeds from his
body. But it is really a vegetable production,
since it retains the characters of that vegetable
from which it derives its origin, and resembles
the wood of trees, in the manner of its growth,
ramification, solidity, drying, and separation;
for, after acquiring its greatest density, it
ceases to extract nourishment, it falls spontane∣ously,
like a ripe fruit from the branch. The
very name given to this production in our lan∣guage,
is an indication that it has been regarded
as wood<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The French call the horns of a stag his <HI>wood.</HI></NOTE>, and not as a horn, a bone, a tusk,
&amp;c. And, though this theory seems to be suffi∣ciently
established by the preceding reasoning,
yet I ought not to pass over a fact recorded by
the antients. Aristotle<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Captus jam cervus est, hederam suis enatam cornibus ge∣rens viridem, quae cornu adhuc tenello forte inserta, quasi ligno viridi coaluerit. <HI>Arist. Hist. Animal. l.</HI> ix. <HI>c.</HI> 5.</NOTE>, Theophrastus<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Hedera in multis creatur, et quod mirabilius, visa est in cornibus cervi etiam aliquando, Commovit (inquit Jul. Scali∣ger apud Theophrastum) virum accuratum cervi cornibus hae∣rens hedera; quid enim eo seminium detulit, &amp;c. <HI>Lib.</HI> II. <HI>de caus. Plant. cap.</HI> 23.</NOTE>, and
Pliny<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">In mollioribus cervorum cornibus hedera coalescit, dum ex arborum attritu illa experiuntur. <HI>Plin. de admirand. auditionibus.</HI></NOTE>, tell us, that ivy has been seen growing
round the young horns of stags. If this fact be
<PB N="98" REF="131"/>
true, and it may easily be determined by experi∣ment,
an analogy still more intimate will be e∣stablished
between the <HI>wood</HI> of the stag and that
of trees.</P>
<P>The horns and tusks of other animals are not
only different from the <HI>wood</HI> of the stag; but, in
their growth, texture, and form, both external
and internal, there is nothing analogous to wood.
The nails, the claws, the hairs, the feathers, the
scales of animals, grow, it is admitted, by a spe∣cies
of vegetation; but this vegetation differs
widely from that of wood. The horns of oxen,
goats, antelopes, &amp;c. are hollow within; but
the wood of the stag is equally solid through
its whole extent. The substance of these horns
is the same with that of the nails, claws, and
scales: But the horns of the stag resemble wood
more than any other substance. The inside of
all hollow horns is covered with a kind of <HI>peri∣osteum,</HI>
and they contain in their cavity a bone,
or core, which supports them; they never shed,
but grow during the life of the animal; and its
age may be learned by their rings or annual
circles. Instead of growing by their superior ex∣tremity,
like the <HI>wood</HI> of the stag, they grow
like nails, feathers, and hairs, by their inferior
extremity. In the same manner, the tusks of
the elephant, walrus, and wild boar, and all o∣ther
animals, are hollow within, and grow only
by their inferior extremity. Thus horns and
<PB N="99" REF="132"/>
tusks have no more analogy to the <HI>wood</HI> of the
stag than nails, hairs, or feathers.</P>
<P>Vegetation may, therefore, be reduced to three
kinds. The first, in which the growth proceeds
from the superior extremity, as in plants, trees,
and the <HI>wood</HI> of the stag; the second, where the
growth advances from the inferior extremity, as
in horns, nails, claws, hairs, feathers, scales,
tusks, teeth, and other external parts of animal
bodies; the third, in which the growth proceeds
from both extremities at the same time, as in
bones, cartilages, muscles, tendons, and other in∣ternal
parts of animals. The material cause of all
these three species, is the redundance of organic
nourishment; and the assimilation of this nou∣rishment
by the internal mould, which receives
it, is the effect. Thus the growth of an animal
is always more or less rapid, in proportion to the
quantity of this redundant nourishment; and,
after the greatest part of growth is acquired, it
is determined to the seminal reservoirs, endea∣vours
to escape from the body, and to produce,
by means of copulation, new organized beings.
The difference between animals, which, like the
stag, have fixed seasons, and other animals which
can engender at all times, proceeds entirely from
their manner of feeding. Man and domestic a∣nimals,
who have daily an equal quantity of
food, and often too much, are perpetually in a
capacity for procreation. The stag, on the con∣trary,
and most wild animals, who suffer greatly
<PB N="100" REF="133"/>
in the winter for want of food, have then no∣thing
redundant, and are incapable of generating
till they recruit during the summer. It is im∣mediately
after this season that the stag begins
to rut; and, by the great waste he suffers at this
period, he continues, during winter, in a state
of languor and debility. His flesh is then so
meagre, and his blood so impoverished, that
worms breed under his skin, which still augment
his misery, and he does not get quit of them till
the spring, when he acquires new life and vigour
by the active nourishment furnished to him by
the fresh productions of the earth.</P>
<P>Thus the life of the stag is spent in alternate
plenty and want, vigour and debility, health and
sickness, without having any change introduced
into his constitution by these opposite extremes.
He lives as long as other animals which are not
subjected to such vicissitudes. As he grows five
or six years, he lives seven times that number,
or from 35 to 40 years<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nouveau traité de la venerie, p. 141.</NOTE>. What has been re∣ported
concerning the longevity of the stag me∣rits
no credit. It is only a popular prejudice
which prevailed in the days of Aristotle, and
which that philosopher considered as improbable,
because neither the time of gestation, nor of the
growth of the young stag, indicated long life<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vita esse perquam longa hoc animal fertur; sed nihil certi ex <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> quae narrantur videmus; nec gestatio aut incrementum hin∣nulli ita evenit quasi vita esset praelonga. <HI>Arist. Hist. Animal. lib.</HI> vi. c. 29.</NOTE>.
<PB N="101" REF="134"/>
This authority ought to have abolished the pre∣judice:
But it has been renewed, in the ages of ig∣norance,
by a fabulous account of a stag taken by
Charles VI. in the forest of Senlis, with a collar
upon which was written this inscription, <HI>Caesar
hoc me donavit.</HI> The love of the marvellous
inclined men to believe that this animal had lived
a thousand years, and had his collar from a Ro∣man
Emperor, rather than to suppose that he came
from Germany, where all the Emperors take the
name of <HI>Caesar.</HI></P>
<P>The horns of the stag augment annually both
in height and thickness, from the second to the
eighth year, and continue nearly in equal beauty
during all the vigour of life. But when he
grows old, his horns decline. Our stags have
seldom more than twenty or twenty-two ant∣lers
or palms; and this number, even when at
the highest pitch of vigour and perfection, is by
no means constant; for it varies every year, ac∣cording
to the quantity of nourishment and re∣pose
the animal has enjoyed: The largeness of
the horns depends on the same cause; and their
quality is also determined by the kind of nou∣rishment
they receive. Like the wood of the
forest, the <HI>wood</HI> of the stag is large, tender, and
light in moist and fertile countries, and short,
hard, and heavy, in dry and barren regions.</P>
<P>The size and stature of the animals them∣selves
likewise differ according to the places
they inhabit. The stags which frequent the
<PB N="102" REF="135"/>
valleys, or hills abounding in grain, are larger
and taller than those which feed upon dry and
rocky mountains. The latter are low, thick,
and short. Neither are they equally swift; but
they run longer than the former: They are also
more vicious, and have longer hair on their
heads. Their horns are commonly short and
black, like a stunted tree, the bark of which
is always of a darker colour. But the horns of
the stags which feed in the plains are high, and
of a clear reddish colour, like the wood and bark
of trees which grow in a good soil. These little
squat stags never frequent the lofty woods, but
keep always among the coppices, where they
can more easily elude the pursuit of the dogs.
The Corsican appears to be the smallest of
these mountain-stags. He exceeds not the half
of the height of the ordinary kind, and may be
regarded as a terrier among stags. His colour
is brown, his body is squat, and his legs are
short. And, what convinces me, that the size
and stature of stags in general depend on the
quantity and quality of their food, is, that, ha∣ving
reared one at my house, and fed him very
plentifully for four years, he was much taller,
thicker, and plumper at that age than the oldest
stags in my woods, which are, however, of a
very good size.</P>
<P>Yellow is the most common colour of the
stag. But many of them are brown, and others
<PB N="103" REF="136"/>
red. White stags are more rare, and seem to be a
race that has become domestic, but very antient∣ly;
for both Aristotle and Pliny mention white
stags; and they appear then to have been equal∣ly
uncommon as at present. The colour of the
horns, like that of the hair, depends on the age
and nature of the animal, and the impression of
the air. The horns of young stags are whitish,
and less deeply coloured than those of the old.
Stags, whose colour is a clear diluted yellow,
have often pale ill-coloured horns. Those which
are of a lively yellow have generally red horns;
and brown stags, especially those which have
black hair on the neck, have likewise black
horns. The internal substance of the horns, it
is true, is almost equally white in all stags; but
they differ greatly in solidity and texture. Some
of them are very spongy, and even contain pret∣ty
large cavities. This difference in texture is
sufficient to account for their assuming different
colours; and it is unnecessary to have recourse
to the juices of trees, since we daily see the
whitest ivory turn yellow or brown after being
exposed to the air, though its texture be much
more compact than that of the stag's horns.</P>
<P>The stag appears to have a fine eye, an acute
smell, and an excellent ear. When listening, he
raises his head, erects his ears, and hears from a
great distance. When he is going into a cop∣pice,
or other half covered place, he stops to
look round him on all sides, and scents the wind,
<PB N="104" REF="137"/>
to discover if any object is near that might di∣sturb
him. He is a simple, and yet a curious
and crafty animal. When hissed or called to
from a distance, he stops short, and looks sted∣fastly,
and with a kind of admiration, at carria∣ges,
cattle, or men; and, if they have neither
arms nor dogs, he moves on unconcernedly, and
without flying. He appears to listen, with great
tranquillity and delight, to the shepherd's pipe;
and the hunters sometimes employ this artifice
to encourage and deceive him. In general, he
is less afraid of men than of dogs, and is never
suspicious, or uses any arts of concealment, but
in proportion to the disturbances he has recei∣ved.
He eats slow, and has a choice in his ali∣ment;
and, after his stomach is full, he lies
down, and ruminates at leisure. He seems to
ruminate with less facility than the ox. It is
only by violent shakes that the stag can make
the food rise from his first stomach. This diffi∣culty
proceeds from the length and direction of
the passage through which the aliment has to
go. The neck of the ox is short and straight;
but that of the stag is long and arched; and
therefore greater efforts are necessary to raise
the food. These efforts are made by a kind of
hiccup, the movement of which is apparent, and
continues during the time of rumination. His
voice is stronger, and more quivering, in pro∣portion
as he advances in years. The voice of
the hind is shorter and more feeble. She never
<PB N="105" REF="138"/>
bellows from love, but from fear. The stag,
during the rutting season, bellows in a frightful
manner: He is then so transported, that no∣thing
disturbs or terrifies him. He is, therefore,
easily surprised; as he is loaded with fat, he can∣not
keep long before the dogs. But he is dan∣gerous
when at bay, and attacks the dogs with
a species of fury. He drinks none in winter,
nor in spring, the dews and tender herbage be∣ing
then sufficient to extinguish his thirst. But,
during the parching heats of summer, to obtain
drink, he frequents the brooks, the marshes, and
the fountains; and, in the season of love, he is
so over-heated, that he searches every where for
water, not only to satisfy his immoderate thirst,
but to bathe and refresh his body. He then
swims easier than at any other times on account
of his fatness. He has been observed crossing
very large rivers. It has even been alledged,
that, attracted by the odour of the hinds, the
stags, in the rutting season, throw themselves
into the sea, and pass from one island to another
at the distance of several leagues. They leap
still more nimbly than they swim; for, when
pursued, they easily clear a hedge or a pale fence
of six feet high. Their food varies in different
seasons. In autumn, after rutting, they search
for the buds of green shrubs, the flowers of
broom or heath, the leaves of brambles, &amp;c.
During the snows of winter, they feed upon the
bark, moss, &amp;c. of trees; and, in mild weather,
<PB N="106" REF="139"/>
they brouze in the wheat-fields. In the begin∣ning
of spring, they go in quest of the catkins
of the trembling poplar, willow, and hazel trees,
the flowers and buds of the cornel-tree, &amp;c.
In summer, when they have great choice, they
prefer rye to all other grain, and the black berry-bearing
alder<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rhamnus frangula Linn.</NOTE> to all other wood. The flesh of the
fawn is very good; that of the hind and knobber
not absolutely bad; but that of the stag has al∣ways
a strong and disagreeable taste. The skin
and the horns are the most useful parts of this
animal. The skin makes a pliable and very du∣rable
leather. The horns are used by cutlers,
sword-slippers, &amp;c. and a volatile spirit, much
employed in medicine, is extracted from them
by the chymists.</P>

<P>It is well known, that, in many animals, as
cats, owls, &amp;c. the pupil of the eye contracts
prodigiously in the light, and dilates in the dark.
But this great contraction and dilatation had ne∣ver
been observed in the eyes of the stag. I re∣ceived
from M. Beccaria, a learned physician
and celebrated professor at Pisa, the following
letter, dated at Turin, October 28. 1767.</P>
<P>'I presented a piece of bread,' says M. Bec∣caria,
'to a stag that was confined in an obscure
<PB N="107" REF="140"/>
apartment, to allure him to a window, that I
might admire at leisure the rectangular and
transverse form of his pupils, which, in a
strong light, exceed not half a line in width,
by about five lines in length. In a fainter
light, their breadth enlarges to more than a
line and a half; but still preserve their rectan∣gular
figure: And in passing from light to
darkness, they dilate about four lines, but al∣ways
transversely, that is, horizontally, and
preserving their rectangular form. These facts
may be easily ascertained, by laying the hand
upon the eye of a stag; for, whenever the eye
is uncovered, the pupil will be seen dilated a∣bove
four lines.'</P>
<P>From this fact M. Beccaria concludes with
probability, that the other species of deer enjoy
the same power of contracting and dilating their
pupils. But, what is most remarkable, the pu∣pils
of cats, owls, and several other animals,
contract and dilate vertically, while that of the
stag contracts and dilates horizontally.</P>
<P>To the history of the stag, I must add a fact
communicated to me by M. le Marquis d'Ame∣zaga,
who, to much learning, has joined great
experience in the chace.</P>
<P>'Stags,' he remarks, 'shed their horns soon∣er
or later in the month of March, in propor∣tion
to their ages. At the end of June, the
horns of the old stag are long, and begin to
itch him. It is at this time also, that the stags
<PB N="108" REF="141"/>
begin to rub off the skin which covers their
horns. At the commencement of August,
their horns begin to assume that consistence
which they retain during the rest of the year:
On the 17th of October, the attendants of the
Prince of Condé pursued a stag of six years
old. This was the rutting season, when the
stags are much less vigorous; but we were
surprised to find the animal fly at a great rate,
and lead near fix leagues from his harbour.'</P>
<P>'When this stag was seized, we found that
his horns were white, and sprinkled with blood,
as they ought to be at the time they are rub∣bed
against the trees; and that they had still
rags of the skin which covers them during the
time of their growth. His horns were diver∣sified
with many branches. All the hunters
who were in at the death expressed their sur∣prise
at these appearances. But their astonish∣ment
was augmented, when they wanted to
remove his testicles; for none were to be found
in the scrotum. But, after opening the body,
two testicles were discovered in the abdomen
about the size of filberds, and we clearly per∣ceived
that he had never experienced the ef∣fects
of the rut. It is well known, that, during
the months of June, July, and August, the
stags are prodigioustly loaded with fat, which
is generally so entirely exhausted about the
middle of September, that nothing but the mus∣cular
flesh remains. But this stag had lost
<PB N="109" REF="142"/>
none of his fat, because he was never in a
condition for rutting. He had still another
singularity; for, in the right foot, he wanted
the middle bone, which, in the left, was half
an inch long, and as large and pointed as a
tooth-pick.'</P>
<P>'It is well known, that a stag, castrated when
he has no horns, never afterwards acquires
them, and that, if the operation is performed
when his horns are in perfection, they remain
in the same state during life. Hence it ap∣pears,
that the very minute organs of genera∣tion
above described were sufficient to pro∣duce
the annual change of horns; but that
Nature has always proceeded slowly in the con∣formation
of this animal; for we could disco∣ver
no marks of any accident which could in∣duce
us to believe that the order of Nature had
been deranged. It is, therefore, reasonable to
suppose, that this retardation proceeded from
the imbecillity of the organs of generation,
which, however, were sufficient to produce the
fall and renewal of the horns, since the cab∣bage
or burs demonstrated, that, at the time
this stag was killed, he had had horns annual∣ly
from the second to the sixth year.'</P>
<P>These observations of the Marquis d'Ameza∣ga
seem to prove, in a still stronger manner than
any thing formerly remarked, that the fall and
renovation of the stag's horns depend entirely
on the presence of the testicles, and partly on
<PB N="110" REF="143"/>
their being more or less perfect; for, in the in∣stance
before us, the testicles being imperfect
and too small, the horns, for that reason, in their
growth, shedding, and renewal, were much later
than in other stags.</P>
<P>Pontoppidan, when speaking of the Norwe∣gian
stags, remarks, 'that they are only found
in the dioceses of Bergen and Drontheim;
that they sometimes swim in flocks across the
straits between the continent and the neigh∣bouring
islands, resting their heads upon each
other's crupper; and that, when the chief of
the file is fatigued, he retires behind to repose
himself, and the most vigorous occupies his
place<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pontoppidan's Nat. Hist. of Norway.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>It has been thought, that the stags of our
forests might, by treating them with care and
gentleness, as the Laplanders manage the rain∣deer,
be rendered domestic. Upon this subject,
M. le Vicomte de Querhoënt has communicated
to me the following fact. Stags were first
brought to the Isle of France by the Portuguese.
They are small, and of a greyer colour than
those of Europe, from whom, however, they de∣rived
their origin. When the French took pos∣session
of this island, they found great numbers
of those stags, of which they destroyed a part,
and the remainder took refuge in the most re∣tired
places. They are now rendered domestic,
<PB N="111" REF="144"/>
and some of the inhabitants keep large flocks of
them.</P>
<P>I have seen, at l'Ecole Veterinaire, a small kind
of stag, which was said to have been brought
from the Cape of Good Hope. Its skin was in∣terspersed
with white spots, like that of the axis.
It was called the <HI>Hog-stag,</HI> because its legs were
thicker, and it had not the same agility of body
as the common kind. The figure of it is repre∣sented
in the Plate. Its length from the muzzle
to the extremity of the body, was only three
feet four inches and a half; the legs were short,
and the feet and hoofs very small; the colour
yellow, mixed with white spots; the eye black
and open, with large black hair on the upper
eye-lid; the nostrils black, with a blackish band
at the corners of the mouth; the colour of the
head the same with that of the belly, only mixed
with grey, and brown on the chanfrin and sides
of the eyes; the ears very large, garnished on
the inside with white hairs, and with smooth
hair, mixed with yellow, on the outside. The
horns of this stag were eleven inches seven lines
in length, and ten lines thick. The top of the
back was browner than the rest of the body. The
tail was yellow above and white below; and the
legs were of a brownish black colour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr Pennant, in his Synopsis of Quadrupeds, which was published in the year 1771, has described this animal as a dis∣tinct species of deer. It is surprising, that this circumstance should have escaped our author, especially as the two descrip∣tions vary in several particulars. Mr Pennant's words are: 'PORCINE DEER, with slender trifurcated horns, thirteen inches long, six inches distant at the base; head ten inches and a half long: Body, from the tip of the nose to the tail, three feet six inches: height, from the shoulders to the hoof, two feet two inches, and about two inches higher behind: Length of the tail eight inches: Body thick and clumsy: Legs fine and slender: Colour on the upper part of the neck, body, and sides, brown; belly and rump of a lighter colour.

<P>NO species of animals makes so near an ap∣proach
to another as the fallow deer to
that of the stag. But though their similarity
be great in every respect, they fly from each o∣ther,
never intermix, and, of course, give rise to
no intermediate race. It is even rare to find fal∣low
deer in a country much frequented by stags,
unless they are industriously transported into it.
Their nature seems to be less rustic and robust
than that of the stag; and they are likewise less
common in the forests. They are kept in parks,
<PB N="114" REF="151"/>
where they may be said to be half domestic.
More of them are reared in England than in any
other country of Europe; and the English are
extremely fond of their venison. The dogs al∣so
prefer the flesh of this deer to that of all other
animals; and, after they have once eat of it,
they are extremely apt, in the chace of the stag
or roe deer, to change their course when they
perceive the scent of the fallow deer. In some
provinces of France, and in the neighbourhood
of Paris, there are fallow deer, as also in Spain
and Germany. Those of America were probably
transported from Europe. It seems to be an a∣nimal
peculiar to the temperate climates; for
there are none in Russia, and they are seldom
met with in Sweden or other northern coun∣tries<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Linn. Faun. Suec.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The stags are more generally diffused over
Europe; they are even found in Norway, and
all the northern regions, Lapland, perhaps,
excepted. They are also frequent in Asia, espe∣cially
in Tartary<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Description de l'Inde, par Marc Paul, liv. 1. p. 38. Let∣tres edifiantes, recueil 26. p. 371.</NOTE>, and the northern provinces
of China. They are likewise found in America;
for those of Canada<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The Canadian stag is precisely the same with that of France; <HI>description de la Nouv. France, par Charlevoix, tom.</HI> 13. <HI>p.</HI> 129.</NOTE> differ from ours only in
the length of their horns, and the direction of
<PB N="115" REF="152"/>
their antlers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the figure of the Canadian stag, in <HI>l'hist. des animaux, par M. Perrault.</HI></NOTE>, which is sometimes not straight,
as in the common stag, but turned backward, so
that the end of each points to the stem of the
horns. But this form of the horns is not abso∣lutely
peculiar to the stag of Canada; for we
find similar horns engraven in <HI>la Venerie de du
Fouilloux</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">La Venerie de Jacques du Fouilloux, p. 22.</NOTE>; and those of the Corsican stag
have straight antlers; which is a sufficient
proof that the Canadian stag is only a variety,
to which stags of all countries are subject.
There are likewise horns which have a number
of antlers on their summits, in form of a crown.
These are rarely found in France; but, says Du
Fouilloux<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 20.</NOTE>, they come from Russia and Germa∣ny.
This is only another variety, and not a
different species from the common kind. Hence,
in Canada, as well as in France, most stags have
straight antlers; but in the former, they are lar∣ger
and thicker; because they find, in these un∣inhabited
regions, more nourishment and repose
than in populous countries. There are large
and small stags in America, as well as in Europe.
But, however generally this species is diffused, it
seems to be limited to cold and temperate cli∣mates.
The stags of Mexico and South A∣merica,
those of Cayenne, those called <HI>Gange
stags,</HI> mentioned in M. Perrault's memoirs, un∣der
<PB N="116" REF="153"/>
the name of <HI>Sardinian hinds,</HI> those denomi∣nated
<HI>Cape stags,</HI> and those of Guiney, and other
warm countries, belong not to the common spe∣cies,
as will appear when the particular history
of each is given.</P>
<P>As the fallow deer is less savage, more deli∣cate,
and approaches nearer to the domestic state
than the stag, he is also subject to a greater num∣ber
of varieties. Besides the common and the
white fallow deer, there are several other varie∣ties,
as those of Spain, which are nearly as large
as the stag; but their neck is not so thick, and
their colour is darker, with a blackish tail, not
white below, and longer than that of the com∣mon
kind; those of Virginia, which are almost
as large as those of Spain, and remarkable for
the great size of their genital organs: Others
have a compressed forehead, ears and tail longer
than those of the common fallow deer, and
marked with a white spot upon the hoofs of the
hind feet; others are spotted with white, black,
and yellow; and others are entirely black. All
these have their horns flatter, broader, and bet∣ter
garnished with antlers than those of the stag;
they likewise incline more inwardly, and are
more palmated at the points; and, when the
horns are very strong, the largest antlers are
sometimes terminated by small plams. The tail
of the common fallow deer is longer than that
of the stag, and its hair is brighter. The horns
of the fallow deer shed, like those of the stag;
<PB N="117" REF="154"/>
but they fall off later, and are renewed nearly
at the same time. Their rutting season arrives
fifteen days or three weeks after that of the stag.
The males then bellow frequently, but with a
low and interrupted voice. They are not so
furious as the stag, nor exhaust themselves by
rutting. They never depart from their own
country in quest of females; but they dispute
and fight for the possession of their mistresses.
They associate in herds, which almost always
keep together. When there is a great number
in one park, they generally form themselves in∣to
two distinct troops, which soon become ho∣stile,
because they both wish to occupy the same
part of the inclosure. Each of these troops has
its own chief, who marches foremost; and he is
always the oldest and strongest of the flock.
The others follow him; and the whole draw up
in order of battle, to force the other troop from
the best pasture. The order with which these
combats are conducted is very singular. They
make regular attacks, fight with courage, mutu∣ally
support each other, and never think them∣selves
vanquished by a single check; for the battle
is daily renewed, till the weaker are completely
defeated, and obliged to remain in the worst pa∣sture.
They love elvated and hilly countries.
When chaced, they run not out, like the stag,
but double, and endeavour to conceal themselves
from the dogs by artifice, and by substituting an∣other
animal in their place. However, when
<PB N="118" REF="155"/>
fatigued and heated, they take the water, but
never attempt to cross such extensive rivers as
the stag. Thus, between the chace of the fal∣low
deer and stag, there is no material difference.
Their knowledge and instincts, their shifts and
doublings, are the same, only they are more fre∣quently
practised: by the fallow deer. As he is
less enterprising, and runs not so far before the
dogs, he has oftener occasion to change, or sub∣stitute
another in his place, to double, return up∣on
his former tracts, &amp;c. which renders the hunt∣ing
of the fallow deer more subject to inconve∣niencies
than that of the stag. Besides, as he is
smaller and lighter, the impressions of his feet
upon the ground are slighter, and the branches
he knocks off from the trees with his horns are
smaller. Hence the dogs are less apt to observe
the change, or substitution of another animal,
and it is more difficult to bring them into the
scent when at fault.</P>
<P>The fallow deer is very easily tamed, and eats
many substances which are rejected by the stag.
He likewise preserves his fat or venison much
better; for he is not rendered meagre by rutting,
though followed by the longest and severest
winters; and he is nearly in the same condition
during the whole year. He brouzes closer than
the stag, which makes the trees or bushes cut by
him more difficult to shoot than those cut by the
stag. The young fallow deer eat quicker, and
with more avidity than the old. They rumi∣nate;
<PB REF="156"/>

</FIGURE>
<PB N="119" REF="158"/>
they search for the females in their second
year, and attach not themselves to one, like the
roe buck, but love variety, like the stag. The
female goes with young eight months and some
days. Like the hind, she produces one, some∣times
two, and very rarely three fawns. They
are capable of engendering and producing from
the age of two to that of fifteen or sixteen years.
Lastly, the fallow deer resemble the stag in al∣most
all their natural dispositions and habits;
the greatest difference between these two animals
consists in the duration of their lives. We for∣merly
remarked, from the testimony of hunts∣men,
that the stag lives thirty-five or forty years;
and, from the same authority, we learn that the
fallow deer live only about twenty years. As
they are smaller, it is probable that their growth
is sooner accomplished than that of the stag; be∣cause,
in all animals, the duration of life is pro∣portioned
to the time of growing, and not to the
time of gestation; for here the time of gestation
is the same. Besides, in other species, as that of
the ox, though the time of gestation be long,
the duration of life is short. Of course, we
ought not to measure the duration of life by the
time of gestation, but by that of the growth,
reckoning from birth nearly to the full expan∣sion
of the body<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For a few supplementary remarks on the fallow deer, see the article <HI>Axis.</HI></NOTE>.</P>

The weight of a full grown buck is near 60 lb. The hair in summer is very short and smooth. The ends of the hairs are of a deep red colour, and the bottoms of a dark grey. In winter, the hairs are very long, and hoary at the tips, except on the back, where they are often very dark.

<P>AS the stag is the noblest inhabitant of the
wood, he occupies the deepest shades of
the forest, and the most elevated ridges of those
mountains which are covered with lofty trees.
The roe deer, as if inferior in species, contents
<PB N="121" REF="160"/>
himself with a humbler residence, and generally
dwells among the thick foliage of young brush∣wood.
But, if he is inferior to the stag in dig∣nity,
strength, and stature, he is endowed with
more gracefulness, vivacity, and courage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When the fawns of the roe deer are attacked, he defends them with courage, and, though smaller, he has strength enough to combat a young stag, and put him to flight; <HI>Nouv. Trailé de la Venerie,</HI> p. 178.</NOTE>. He
is superior in gaiety, neatness, and sprightliness.
His figure is more elegant and handsome. His
eyes are more brilliant and animated. His
limbs are more nimble, his movements quicker,
and he bounds, seemingly without effort, with
equal vigour and agility. His coat, or hair, is
always clean, smooth, and glossy. He never
wallows in the mire, like the stag. He delights
in dry and elevated situations, where the air is
purest. He is likewise more crafty, conceals
himself with greater address, is more difficult to
trace, and derives superior resources from instinct:
For, though he has the misfortune to leave be∣hind
him a stronger scent than the stag, which
redoubles the ardour and appetite of the dogs,
he knows how to withdraw himself from their
pursuit, by the rapidity with which he begins
his flight, and by his numerous doublings. He
delays not his arts of defence till his strength
fails him; but, as soon as he finds that the first
efforts of a rapid chace have been unsuccessful,
he repeatedly returns on his former steps; and,
after confounding, by these opposite movements,
<PB N="122" REF="161"/>
the direction he has taken, after intermixing
the present with the past emanations from
his body, he rises from the earth by a great
bound, and, retiring to a side, he lies down flat
on his belly, and, in this immoveable situation,
he allows the whole troop of his deceived ene∣mies
to pass very near him.</P>
<P>The roe deer differs from the stag and fallow
deer in disposition, temperament, manners, and
almost every natural habit. Instead of associa∣ting
in heards, they live in separate families. The
father, mother, and young, go together, and
never mix with strangers. They are constant in
their amours, and never unfaithful like the stag.
As the females generally produce two fawns,
the one male and the other female, these young
animals, brought up and nourished together, ac∣quire
so strong a mutual affection, that they ne∣ver
quit each other, unless one of them meets
with a misfortune, which never ought to sepa∣rate
lovers. This attachment is more than love;
for, though always together, they feel the ar∣dour
of the rut but once a year, and it continues
only fifteen days, commencing at the end of
October, and ending before the fifteenth day of
November. They are not then, like the stag,
overloaded with fat: They have no strong smell,
no fury, in a word, nothing that can change the
state of their bodies. During this period, they
indeed suffer not their fawns to remain with
them. The father drives them off, as if he meant
<PB N="123" REF="162"/>
to oblige them to yield their place to those
which are to succeed, and to form new families
for themselves. However, after the rutting sea∣son
is past, the fawns return to their mother,
and remain with her some time; after which
they separate forever, and remove to a distance
from the place which gave them birth.</P>
<P>The female goes with young five months and
a half, and brings forth about the end of April
or beginning of May. The hinds, as formerly
remarked, go with young above eight months;
and this difference alone is sufficient to prove,
that these animals are so remote from each other
in species, as to prevent their ever intermixing
or producing an intermediate race. By this dif∣ference,
as well as that of figure and size, they
approach the goat as much as they recede from
the stag; for the goat goes with young nearly
the same time, and the roe deer may be regard∣ed
as a wild goat, which, feeding solely on wood,
carries <HI>wood</HI> instead of horns. The female, when
about to bring forth, separates from the male.
To avoid the wolf, who is her most dangerous
enemy, she conceals herself in the deepest reces∣ses
of the forest. In ten or twelve days, the
fawns acquire strength sufficient to enable them
to follow her. When threatened with danger,
she hides them in a close thicket, and, to preserve
them, presents herself to be chaced. But, not∣withstanding
all her care and anxiety, the young
are sometimes carried off by men, dogs, or
<PB N="124" REF="163"/>
wolves. This is indeed the time of their great∣est
destruction. Of this species, which is not
very numerous, I know, from experience, that
more are destroyed in the month of May, than
during all the rest of the year. I often live in a
part of the country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At Montbard in Burgundy.</NOTE> where roe deer are greatly
esteemed. Many fawns are annually brought
me alive by men, and others killed by dogs,
without reckoning those which are devoured by
wolves: And I have observed, during the space
of more than twenty-five years, that, as if there
were a perfect equilibrium between the causes
of destruction and renovation, their number is
always nearly equal in the same districts. It is
not difficult to count them; for they are no
where numerous, and they live separately in di∣stinct
families: In a coppice, for example, of
100 acres, there will be one family, or from three
to five individuals; for a female, which gene∣rally
produces two fawns, sometimes brings forth
but one, and sometimes, though very seldom,
three. In another district, of double the extent,
there will be seven or eight, that is, two fami∣lies;
and I have remarked, that each district al∣ways
harbours an equal number, excepting when
the winters have been extremely rigorous and
long: In this case, the whole family is destroy∣ed;
but it is replaced by another the following
year; and those districts, for which they have a
predilection, are always inhabited nearly by an
<PB N="125" REF="164"/>
equal number. It is alledged, however, that, in
general, their number is diminishing. There are
whole provinces, it must be acknowledged, of
France, where not one of them is to be found.
Though common in Scotland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They are not very common in Scotland; for they exist no where but in what is called the <HI>Highlands,</HI> or northern moun∣tains of Scotland.</NOTE>, there are none
in England. They are very rare in Italy; and
they are now scarcer in Sweden than formerly,
&amp;c. But this effect may have proceeded from
the diminution of forests, or from some very se∣vere
winter, like that of the year 1709, which
almost destroyed the whole roe deer of Burgun∣dy;
so that several years passed before the species
was recruited. Besides, they are not equally
fond of every country; for, in the same coun∣tries,
they prefer particular places. They love
hills, or plains on the tops of mountains. They
never stay in the deepest recesses of the forests,
nor in the middle of extensive woods; but give
the preference to the skirts or projections of
woods which are surrounded with cultivated
sields, and to open coppices which produce the
berry-bearing alder, brambles, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The fawns continue with their parents eight
or nine months, and, when separated, about the
end of the first years of their age, their first horns
begin to appear in the form of two knobs much
less than those of the stag. There is still a great∣er
difference between these two animals: The
horns of the stag shed in the spring, and are re∣newed
<PB N="126" REF="165"/>
in summer; but those of the roe deer fall
off at the end of autumn, and are replaced in
winter. Several causes concur in producing these
different effects. In summer, the stag takes a
great deal of nourishment, and grows exceed∣ingly
fat; he next exhausts himself so much
in the rutting season, that the whole winter is
necessary to recover his vigour. But, during
this season, instead of superabundant nourish∣ment,
he is half starved for want of subsistence,
and, consequently, his horns cannot begin to
shoot till the spring, when his nourishment be∣gins
to be redundant. The roe deer, on the
contrary, who is never so much wasted, has no
occasion for equal reparation; and, as he is ne∣ver
loaded with fat, as no change is produced in
him by rutting, but continues always nearly the
same, he has at all times a redundance of nou∣rishment;
so that even in winter, and a short
time after rutting, he sheds and renews his horns.
Thus, in all these animals, the redundant orga∣nic
nourishment, before it is determined to the
seminal reservoirs, and forms the seminal fluid,
is transferred to the head, and manifests itself
externally by the production of horns; in the
same manner as in man, the hair and the beard
announce and precede the secretion of the semi∣nal
fluid: And, it is apparent, that these vege∣table
productions, as they may be denominated,
are formed of a redundant organic substance, but
still imperfect, and mixed with brute particles,
<PB N="127" REF="166"/>
since they preserve, in their growth and sub∣stance,
the qualities of vegetables. But the se∣minal
fluid, the production of which is not so
early, is a matter purely organic, deprived en∣tirely
of its brute particles, and perfectly assimi∣lated
to the body of the animal.</P>
<P>When the roe deer has renewed his horns, he
rubs them against the trees, like the stag, in or∣der
to tear off the skin with which they are co∣vered;
and this commonly happens in the month
of March, before the trees begin to shoot. Hence
it is not the sap of the wood which colours the
horns of the roe deer. However, the horns are
brown when the animal is brown, and yellow
when he is red; and, consequently, the colour
of the horns proceeds, as formerly remarked<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See above, History of the stag, p. 103.</NOTE>,
solely from the nature of the animal, and the
impression of the air. The second horns of the
roe have two or three antlers in each side; the
third, three or four; the fourth, four or five,
and they seldom have more. We distinguish
the old ones by the thickness of the stems, the
largeness of the bur, of the pearlings, &amp;c. As
long as the horns continue soft, they are ex∣tremely
sensible: Of this I have had a striking
example: The young shoot of a roe buck's
horn was cut off with a ball. The animal
was stunned, and fell down as if he had been
dead. The shooter, who was near, seized him
by the foot; but the buck, suddenly recovering
<PB N="128" REF="167"/>
his senses and his strength, dragged the man,
though he was strong and alert, thirty paces in∣to
the wood. After killing him with a knife,
we discovered that he had received no other
wound. Besides, it is well known, that flies are
very troublesome to the stag: When his horns
are growing, he retires to the deepest parts of
the wood, where the flies are less numerous;
because, when they fix upon the tender horns,
the irritation they occasion is insupportable.
Thus there is an intimate communication be∣tween
the soft parts of the horns, and the whole
nervous system of the animal. The roe buck,
who has nothing to apprehend from the flies,
because he renews his horns in winter, never re∣tires
in this manner; but he walks with caution,
and carries his head low, lest he should touch
the branches.</P>
<P>In the stag, the fallow deer, and roe buck,
the frontal bone has two processes, or eminences,
on which the horns rest. These processes be∣gin
to shoot at the age of five or six months,
soon after acquire their full growth, and, instead
of rising higher in proportion as the animal ad∣vances
in years, they annually sink and dimi∣nish;
so that, in old stags or roe bucks, the
burs are nearly supported upon the frontal bone,
the processes of which having then become very
broad and very short: This is the most certain
mark by which the age of these animals can be
distinguished. At first sight, this fact appears to
<PB N="129" REF="168"/>
be singular, but admits of an easy explanation,
when it is considered, that the horns, supported
by these processes, press against them during the
whole time of growth, which continues for se∣veral
months every year: Hence these bones,
however hard, must become broader and sink
lower annually, by the great and long continued
pressure they receive from every renewal of the
animal's horns. It is for the same reason, that,
though the stems and burs, or rings, always
grow thicker in proportion to the animal's age,
the height of the horns and the number of
antlers diminish so fast, that, when he is very
old, they are only two thick knobs, with very
small antlers.</P>
<P>As the female roe goes with young only five
months and a half, and as the growth of the
fawn is more rapid than that of the stag, the du∣ration
of her life is much shorter, seldom exten∣ding,
I imagine, beyond twelve or fifteen years.
I have reared several of them; but could never
preserve them above five or six years. They
are very delicate in the choice of their food, re∣quire
a great deal of exercise, fine air, and much
room, which is the reason why they are unable,
excepting in the first years of their growth, to re∣sist
the inconveniences of a domestic life. To make
a male live comfortable, he must be furnished with
a female, and a park of a hundred acres. They
may be tamed, but can never be rendered obe∣dient
or familiar. They always retain a por∣tion
<PB N="130" REF="169"/>
of their natural wildness, are easily terrifi∣ed,
and then run with such force and precipita∣tion
against the walls, that they often break
their limbs. However tame they may be, they
cannot be trusted; for the males particularly are
subject to dangerous caprices; they take an aver∣sion
at certain persons, and make furious attacks
with their horns, the blows of which are suffi∣cient
to knock a man to the ground, after which
they continue to tread on him with their feet.
The roe buck bellows not so frequently, nor
with so loud or so strong a voice, as the stag.
The young ones utter a short and plaintive cry,
<HI>mi....mi,</HI> by which they indicate their want of
food. This sound is easily imitated; and the
mother, deceived by the <HI>call,</HI> will come up to
the very muzzle of the hunter's gun.</P>
<P>In winter, the roe bucks frequent the thickest
coppices, and feed upon brambles, broom, heath,
the catkins of the hazel, willow, &amp;c. In spring,
they repair to the more open brushwood, and
eat the buds and young leaves of almost every
tree. This warm food ferments in their sto∣machs,
and intoxicates them to such a degree
that they are easily surprised. They know not
where they are going, and not unfrequently
come out of the wood, and sometimes approach
flocks of cattle, and the habitations of men. In
summer, they dwell in the more elevated coppi∣ces,
from which they seldom depart, excepting
in very dry weather, when they go to drink at
<PB N="131" REF="170"/>
some fountain; for, when the dews abound,
or the leaves are moistened with rain, they ne∣ver
drink. They are delicate in the choice of
their food; they eat not with avidity, like the
stag, and they seldom approach the cultivated
fields, because they prefer the berry-bearing alder
and bramble to grain or pot herbs of any kind.</P>
<P>Though the flesh of these animals be excel∣lent
food; yet it admits of much choice. The
quality of their venison depends chiefly on
the country they inhabit; and even the best
countries produce good and bad kinds. The
flesh of the brown roe buck is finer than that of
the red. All the males, after the age of two
years, have hard and ill-tasted flesh; but that of
the females, though farther advanced in years,
is more tender. The flesh of the fawns, when
very young, is loose and soft; but, at the age of
eighteen months, it is in its highest state of per∣fection.
Those which live in plains and val∣leys
are not good; those that come from moist
countries are still worse; those brought up in
parks are insipid; and, lastly, there are no good
roe bucks but those of dry and elevated coun∣tries,
interspersed with hills, woods, cultivated
and fallow lands, where they enjoy plenty of air,
food, freedom, and solitude; for those which
have been often disturbed are meagre, and the
flesh of those that have been often hunted is dry
and insipid.</P>
<P>This species, which is less numerous than that
of the stag, and very rare in many parts of Eu∣rope,
<PB N="132" REF="171"/>
seems to be much more abundant in Ame∣rica,
where there are two varieties, the red,
which is the largest, and the brown, which has
a white spot behind, and is smaller: And, as
they are found in the northern as well as the
southern parts of America, it is probable that
they differ more from each other than from
those of Europe. They are very common,
for example, in Louisiana<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The flesh of the roe buck is much used in Louisiana. This animal is somewhat larger than the European kind, and his horns are similar to those of the stag; but he differs both in the coat and the colour. He serves the inhabitants in place of mutton; <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sur la Louisiaine,</HI> par <HI>M. Dumont, tom.</HI> 1. <HI>p.</HI> 75.</NOTE>, and larger than
those of France. They are likewise found
in Brazil; for the animal called <HI>Cujuacu-apara</HI>
differs not more from our roe buck than
the stag of Canada from our stag. There is in∣deed
a little variation in the figure of the horns,
as appears from Perrault's figure of the Canadi∣an
stag, compared with the description and fi∣gure
of the Brasilian stag given by Piso. 'In
Brazil,' says Piso, 'there are roe bucks, of
which some have no horns, and are called
<HI>Cujuacu-été,</HI> and others have horns, and are
called <HI>Cujuacu-apara.</HI> The latter are smaller
than the former; their hair is smooth, glossy,
and mixed with brown and white, especially
when the animals are young; for the white is
effaced with age. The foot is divided into two
black toes, upon each of which there is a smal∣ler
one superinduced; the tail is short; the
<PB N="133" REF="172"/>
eyes large and black; the nostrils open; the
horns are of a middle size, and fall off annual∣ly.
The female goes with young five or six
months. They may be tamed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pison. Hist. Brasil. p. 98.</NOTE>,' &amp;c. Mar∣graave
adds, 'that the horns of the <HI>apara</HI> have
three branches, and that the inferior branch is
longest and divided into two.' From these de∣scriptions,
it is apparent, that the <HI>apara</HI> is only a
variety of our roe buck; and Ray suspects<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Raii Synops. anim. quad. p. 90.</NOTE>,
that the <HI>Cujuacu-apara</HI> is the male, and the <HI>Cu∣juacu-été</HI>
the female, and that they both belong
to the same species. I should willingly assent to
Mr Ray's opinion, if Piso had not expressly said,
that those which have horns are smaller than
the other kind. It is not probable that, at Bra∣zil,
the females of this species should be larger
than the males, since every where else they are
smaller. At the same time, though I believe the
<HI>Cujuacu-apara</HI> to be only a variety of our roe
buck, to which we may also add the <HI>Capreolus
marinus</HI> of Johnston, I shall not decide concern∣ing
the <HI>Cujuacu-été</HI> till farther information be
obtained.</P>

<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>It has frequently been mentioned, in my ori∣ginal
work, that the common colours of wild
animals are yellow, brown, and grey, and that
the domestic state gives rise to white fallow deer,
white rabbits, &amp;c. I find, however, that Nature
alone sometimes produces the same effect upon
wild animals. M. l'Abbé de la Villette informs
me, that a man belonging to his brother's estate,
near Orgelet in Franche-comté, brought him two
old roe deers, one of which was of the common
colour, and the other, being a female, was white
as milk, and had no black but on the hoofs and
the extremity of the nose<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Extract of a letter from M. l'Abbé de la Villette a M. de Buffon, dated Lon-le-Saumier, June 17. 1773.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Roe bucks, similar to those of Europe, are
found throughout all North America; only
they are larger, and their size increases in pro∣portion
as the climate becomes more temperate.
The roe bucks of Louisiana are generally double
the size of those of France<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Extract of a letter from M. de Fontenelle, King's physi∣cian at New Orleans, to M. de Buffon.</NOTE>. M. de Fontenelle
adds, that they are easily tamed. In this he is
supported by the evidence of M. Kalm, who
mentions a roe buck which went daily to the
<PB N="135" REF="174"/>
wood in quest of food, and returned to his house
in the evening<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Pierre Kalm, tom. 2. p. 350.</NOTE>. But, in South America, this
species is subject to great varieties. M. de la
Borde, King's physician at Cayenne, says, 'that
they have there four kinds of stags, called in∣discriminately,
both males and females, by the
name of <HI>hinds.</HI> The first kind, called <HI>wood</HI> or
<HI>red hinds,</HI> keep perpetually in the thickest parts
of the woods, to avoid being tormented by the
flies. This kind is taller and thicker than that
called the <HI>savanna hind,</HI> and yet is exceed∣ed
in size by the <HI>barallou hind,</HI> which is the
second species, and of the same colour with the
wood hind. When the males are old, their
horns consist of only one branch, and they at
no period exceed four or five inches in height.
These barallou hinds are rare, and combat the
wood hinds. In these two species, at the side
of each nostril, there are two considerable
glands which secrete a white, fetid humour.'</P>
<P>'The third species is called the <HI>savanna hind.</HI>
Its coat is greyish, and its limbs and body long∣er
than the preceding. M. de la Borde was
assured by the hunters, that the savanna hind
had no glands on the nostrils, and that it was
less savage, and even so curious as to approach
men.'</P>
<P>'The fourth species is the savanna hind,
which is smaller and more common than the
other three. They are not so wild, and their
<PB N="136" REF="175"/>
horns are longer and more palmated or branch∣ed
than those of the other three kinds. They
are called <HI>savanna hinds,</HI> because they fre∣quent
the watery savannas, and lands covered
with marshes.'</P>
<P>'These animals feed upon the manioc, and
often destroy the plantations. Their flesh is
very tender and well-tasted. Both the old and
the young are used as food, and are superior
to the European stags. They tame so easily,
that they run about the streets of Cayenne,
and go out of the town and return, without
being afraid of any object. The females even
go into the woods in quest of wild males, and
afterwards return with their fawns.'</P>
<P>'The caricou is the smallest; his hair is of a
whitish grey colour; and his horns are straight
and pointed. He belongs rather to the roe
buck than to the stag. He never appears near
inhabited places; but is very common in large
woods. However, he is easily tamed; and
the female brings forth only one fawn every
year.'</P>
<P>If the above descriptions be compared with
what is afterwards remarked, in the history of
the <HI>Mazame,</HI> or Mexican deer, it will appear,
that all these pretended species of stags or hinds,
are only roe bucks, the varieties of which are
more numerous in the New than in the Old
Continent.</P>

<P>THE most numerous species of animals are
by no means the most useful. Nothing
can be more noxious than those multitudes of
rats, mice, locusts, caterpillars, and other insects,
the fecundity of which Nature seems rather to
permit than to ordain. But the species of the
<PB N="138" REF="179"/>
hare and of the rabbit afford to man the double
advantage arising from number and utility. The
hare is universally diffused over all the climates
of the earth. The rabbits, though originally na∣tives
of particular climates, multiply so prodigi∣ously
wherever they are transported, that, instead
of being rooted out, much art is necessary to di∣minish
their number, which is sometimes incom∣modious.</P>
<P>When we reflect on the amazing fecundity
of each species, the rapid and prodigious multi∣plication
of particular animals which come forth
in myriads to ravage the earth, we are astonished
that they oppress not Nature by their numbers,
and, after desolating her productions, fall vic∣tims
to the universal waste they have created.</P>
<P>We view with terror the approach of those
thick clouds, those winged armies of famished in∣sects,
which seem to threaten the whole globe
with destruction, and, lighting on the fruitful
plains of Egypt, or of India, annihilate, in an
instant, the labours and the hopes of nations;
and, sparing neither grain, nor fruits, nor herbs,
nor leaves, nor roots, spoil the earth of its ver∣dure,
and convert the richest countries into de∣serts.
We behold, descending from the moun∣tains
of the north, innumerable multitudes of
rats, which, like an animated deluge, overwhelm
the plains, spread over the southern provinces,
and, after destroying, in their passage, every thing
that lives or vegetates, finish their noxious course,
<PB N="139" REF="180"/>
by infecting the earth and the air with the pu∣trid
emanations of their dead carcasses. In the
southern regions, we behold, issuing suddenly
from the deserts, myriads of ants, which, like an
inexhaustible torrent, press forward in continued
columns, drive men and animals from their ha∣bitations,
and never retire till they have produ∣ced
an universal devastation: And, when men,
like the animals, were half savage, and subject
to all the laws and excesses of Nature, have not
similar inundations of the human species taken
place? Have not Normans, Huns, Goths, whole
nations, or rather colonies of fierce and brutal
people, without habitation or name, suddenly
issued from their caverns, and with no other
power but what arises from number, overturned
cities and empires, and, after laying waste the
earth, repeopled it with men equally new and
barbarous as themselves?</P>
<P>These great events, these remarkable aeras in
the history of the human race, are, however,
only slight vicissitudes in the ordinary course of
animated Nature, which, in general, is always
the same: Its movements are performed on two
steady pivots, unlimited fecundity, and those in∣numerable
causes of destruction which reduce the
product of this fecundity to a determined mea∣sure,
and preserve, at all periods, nearly an e∣qual
number of individuals in each species. And,
as those enormous multitudes of animals, which
sometimes suddenly appear, vanish without aug∣menting
<PB N="140" REF="181"/>
menting the common stock, that of the human
species, in like manner, continues always the
same. The variations of the latter are only
slower; because, the life of man being longer
than that of small animals, more is necessary to
bring about the alternate changes of augmenta∣tion
and diminution. But even this time, though
it makes a deep impression, because it has been
accompanied with horror and desolation, is only
an instant in the succession of ages: For, in esti∣mating
the whole human species who ever exist∣ed,
the number of men, like that of all other a∣nimals,
ought, at all periods, to be nearly the
same, since it depends upon the equilibrium of
physical causes; and this equilibrium, to which
every thing has been long reduced, cannot be
infringed either by the efforts of men, or by any
moral circumstances, which are only particular
effects of those physical causes. Whatever care
man may bestow on his own species, he will ne∣ver
render it more numerous in one place, but
at the expence of an equal diminution in another.
When any portion of the earth is overstocked
with men, they disperse, or destroy each other,
and often establish such laws and customs as give
too great a check to this excess of multiplication.
In remarkably prolific climates, as in China,
Egypt, and Guiney, the inhabitants banish, mu∣tilate,
sell, or drown their offspring: In France,
and other Catholic countries, they are condemn∣ed
to perpetual celebacy. Those who exist, usurp
<PB N="141" REF="182"/>
easily the rights of those who have no exist∣ence:
Regarding themselves as necessary beings,
they annihilate those which are contingent, and,
for their own convenience, suppress future ge∣nerations.
The same restrictions are laid upon
man, without his perceiving it, as are imposed upon
the other animals: We cherish or multiply, ne∣glect
or destroy our species, according to the advan∣tages
or inconveniences which result from them:
And, as all moral effects depend upon physical
causes, which, ever since the earth acquired its
consistence, are fixed and permanent, the num∣ber
of the human species, as well as that of all
other animals, must likewise be constant and un∣alterable.
Besides, this sixed state, this constant
number, imply not absolute quantities. All phy∣sical
and moral causes, and the effects that result
from them, are balanced, and comprehended
within certain limits, which are more or less ex∣tended,
but never to such a degree as to destroy
the equilibrium. As the whole universe is in
perpetual motion, as all the powers of matter
mutually act upon and counterbalance each other,
every effect is produced by a kind of oscillations,
to the middle points of which we refer the or∣dinary
course of Nature, and the extremes are
those effects which are farthest removed from
that course. Hence we find, that, both in ani∣mals
and vegetables, an excessive multiplication
is commonly followed by sterility: Plenty and
scarcity alternately succeed each other, and of∣ten
<PB N="142" REF="183"/>
so quickly, that a tolerable judgment may
be formed of the produce of one year by that of
the preceding year. Apple, plumb, oak, beech,
and most fruit and forest trees, produce abun∣dantly
but once every other season. When ca∣terpillars,
flies, field-mice, and other animals
mutliply to excess in one year, their number is
greatly diminished the following year. If insects,
during these fertile seasons, multiplied the next
in proportion to their numbers, the whole fruits
of the earth, all our domestic animals, and even
man himself, would fall victims to their rapacity.
But the causes of destruction and sterility imme∣diately
succeed those which give rise to a redun∣dant
multiplication. Neither is this destruction
occasioned by contagion: It is a necessary con∣sequence
of too great a mass of animated matter
collected in one place. In every species, there
are particular causes of death, as shall afterwards
be shown, which are sufficient to compensate the
excess of preceding generations.</P>
<P>I must again remark, that this reasoning is not
to be understood in an absolute or even in a strict
sense, especially with regard to those species which
are not left entirely to the guidance of Nature.
Man, and the other animals he has taken under
his protection and care, are more abundant than
they would be without that attention he bestows
on them. But, as this care has also its limits,
the augmentation which results from it, has long
been confined by immutable boundaries. And
<PB N="143" REF="184"/>
though, in civilized countries, the human species,
as well as domestic animals, are more numerous
than in other climates, they never multiply to
excess; because, whenever they become incom∣modious,
their number is diminished by the same
power that produced them.</P>
<P>In districts appropriated to the pleasures of the
chace, four or five hundred hares are sometimes
killed in the course of a single day's sport. The
multiplication of these animals is very rapid.
From the first year of their existence, they are
always in a condition for propagating. The fe∣males
go with young only thirty or thirty-one
days. They bring forth three or four at a litter,
and, immediately afterwards, they receive the
male. They likewise admit him during the time
of gestation; and, from a peculiar conforma∣tion
of their organs, they have frequent super∣foetations:
For the uterus is only a continua∣tion
of the vagina, and has neither neck nor o∣rifice,
as in other animals; but, in each horn,
there is an orifice opening into the vagina, which
dilates during the time of bringing forth. Thus
the horns are two distinct uteri, which can act
independent of each other; so that the females
of this species are capable of conceiving and
bringing forth, at different times, by each ute∣rus;
and, consequently, superfoetations must
be as frequent among these animals as they are
rare in those which have not a double organ.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="185"/>
It is, therefore, apparent, that the female
hares may be in season and impregnated at all
times. Another singularity in their structure
proves them to be equally lascivious as they are
fertile. The glans of the clitoris is prominent,
and nearly as large as that of the male penis;
and, as the vulva is hardly visible, and the male,
when young, has neither scrotum nor testicles on
the outside of the body, it is often difficult to
distinguish the females from the males. This
peculiarity of structure has given rise to the fol∣lowing
notions: That hermophradite hares are
very common; that the males sometimes bring
forth young; and that some are alternately males
and females, and perform the functions of ei∣ther
sex, because the females, being more ardent
than the males, often mount upon them, and be∣cause
the external resemblance is so great, that,
unless narrowly examined, the one may easily
be mistaken for the other.</P>
<P>The young, when brought forth, have their
eyes open. The mother suckles them about
twenty days; after which they separate, and pro∣cure
their own food. They never remove far
from each other, nor from the place where they
are littered. They live, however, in solitude,
each making a form or seat at the distance of
sixty or eighty paces. Thus, when we meet with
one young hare, we are almost certain of find∣ing
two or three others in the neighbourhood.
They feed more in the night than in the day;
<PB N="145" REF="186"/>
they eat herbs, roots, leaves, fruit, grain, pre∣ferring
those plants which have milky juices.
During winter, they gnaw the bark indiscrimi∣nately
from all trees, excepting that of the al∣der
and lime, which they never touch. When
reared in houses, they are fed with lettuce and
pot-herbs: But the flesh of those fed hares is al∣ways
bad tasted.</P>
<P>During the day, they sleep or repose in their
form, and are active only in the night, when
they move about, feed, and copulate. When
the moon shines, they are seen playing toge∣ther,
leaping and chacing each other. The small∣est
motion, or the noise of a falling leaf, is suf∣ficient
to terrify and make them fly different
ways.</P>
<P>Some authors maintain, that hares chew the
cud. But I cannot assent to this opinion; be∣cause
they have one stomach only, and its con∣formation,
as well as that of the other intestines,
are totally different from those of ruminating
animals. The caecum of the latter is small, but
that of the hare is very large; and, when to the
capacity of the stomach this large caecum is
added, it is easy to perceive that this animal, by
taking a great quantity of aliment, may live up∣on
herbs alone, like the horse and ass, which
have also a large caecum, and but one stomach,
and, consequently, are incapable of ruminating.</P>
<P>Hares sleep much, but always with open eyes.
They have neither eye-lids nor cilia, and their
<PB N="146" REF="187"/>
eyes seem to be bad. But, as a remuneration,
they have an acute sense of hearing, and enor∣mous
ears in proportion to the size of their bo∣dies.
These long ears they move with great fa∣cility,
and employ them as a rudder to direct
their course, which is so rapid, that they outstrip
all other animals. As their fore legs are much
shorter than the hind legs, they run easier up
than down hill; hence, when pursued, they al∣ways
take to the highest grounds. Their run∣ning
is a kind of gallop, a succession of quick
leaps. Their motion is not accompanied with
noise; because their feet are covered, both above
and below, with hair. They are perhaps the
only animals which have hair in the inside of
the mouth.</P>
<P>The duration of their life, like that of other
animals, is proportioned to the time of their
growth, which is completed in one year, and
they live about seven. The males are said to
live longer than the females. They pass their
days in solitude and silence; and their voice is
never heard but when seized or wounded: It is
a loud, sharp cry, having some resemblance to
the human voice. They are not so savage as
their manners and habits would indicate: They
are gentle, and susceptible of a kind of education.
Though easily tamed, and even rendered cares∣sing,
they never acquire that attachment which
is necessary to make them domestic; for, when
taken young, and brought up in the house, they
<PB N="147" REF="188"/>
take the first opportunity of regaining their li∣berty,
and of flying to the fields. As they have
a fine ear, sit spontaneously on their hind legs,
and use the fore legs as a kind of hands, they
have been trained to beat a drum, to perform
gestures in cadence, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In general, the hare wants neither instinct
sufficient for his own preservation, nor sagacity
for escaping his enemies. He forms a seat or
nest: In winter, he chooses situations exposed
to the south, and, in summer, to the north.
With a view to deceive, he conceals himself be∣tween
clods or hillocks of the same colour with
that of his own hair. 'I have seen,' says Fouil∣loux,
'a hare so sagacious, that, after hearing
the hunter's horn, he started from his form,
and, though at the distance of a quarter of a
league, went to swim in a pool, and lay
down on the rushes in the middle of it,
without being chaced by the dogs. I have
seen a hare, after running two hours before
the dogs, push another from his seat, and take
possession of it. I have seen others swim over
two or three ponds, the narrowest of which was
eighty paces broad. I have seen others, after a
two hours chace, run into a sheep-fold and lie
down among them. I have seen others, when
hard pushed, run in among a flock of sheep,
and would not leave them. I have seen others,
after hearing the noise of the hounds, conceal
themselves in the earth. I have seen others
<PB N="148" REF="189"/>
run up one side of a hedge and return by the
other, when there was nothing else between
them and the dogs. I have seen others, after
running half an hour, mount an old wall, six
feet high, and clap down in a hole covered with
ivy. Lastly, I have seen others swim over a
river of about eighty paces broad, more than
two times, in a length of two hundred paces.'</P>
<P>But these facts unquestionably exhibit the
greatest efforts of their instinct; for their ordi∣nary
resources are not so fine nor so complicated:
When pursued, they first run with rapidity, and
then double, or return upon their former steps.
They always run in the direction that the wind
blows. The females run not so far from their
place of starting as the males; but they double
oftener. In general, hares hunted in the place
that gave them birth, never remove to a great
distance from it, but return to their form; and,
if chaced two days successively, they perform, in
the second day, the same doublings they had ob∣served
the day before. When a hare runs
straight out, and to a great distance from the
place he started, it is a proof that he is a stran∣ger.
It often happens, that male hares, especial∣ly
during the most remarkable period of rutting,
which is in the months of January, February,
and March, when they have few females near
them, perform journies of several leagues in
quest of mates; but, as soon as they are started
by the dogs, they fly back to the place of their
<PB N="149" REF="190"/>
nativity, and never more return. The females
wander not in this manner. Though longer
than the males, they are weaker and less agile:
But they are more timid; for they never allow
the dogs to come so near their seats as the males,
and their doublings are more frequent. They
are also more delicate, and more susceptible of
impressions from the weather. They avoid wa∣ter
and dews. But there are males called <HI>meas∣led
hares,</HI> which love marshy and watery grounds.
The flesh of these hares is bad tasted; and, in
general, the flesh of all hares which inhabit val∣leys,
is whitish and insipid; but those of elevated
or hilly countries, where the wild thime and o∣ther
savory herbs abound, are extremely good.
It has even been remarked, that those which live
in the low woody grounds of the same country,
are not near so good as those that inhabit the
ridges of hills, or the cultivated fields, and vine-yards;
and that the flesh of the female is always
more delicate than that of the male.</P>
<P>The nature of the soil has a considerable influ∣ence
on the hare, as well as upon all other ani∣mals.
The mountain hares are larger than those
of the plains, and likewise of a different colour.
The former are browner, and have more white
under the neck than the latter, which are almost
red. In high mountains, and in northern re∣gions,
they become white during winter, and
resume their usual colour in the summer. Only
a few, and perhaps these are very old, continue
<PB N="150" REF="191"/>
white; for they all turn more or less white with
age. The hares of Italy, Spain, and Barbary,
are smaller than those of France and other nor∣thern
nations. According to Aristotle, they are
smaller in Egypt than in Greece.</P>
<P>Hares are equally diffused over all climates.
They abound in Sweden, Denmark, Poland, Rus∣sia,
France, Britain, Germany, Barbary, Egypt,
the islands of the Archipelago, and particularly
Delos<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Descript. des Isles de l'Archipel de Dapper, p. 375.</NOTE>, which was called <HI>Lagaia</HI> by the antient
Greeks, because of the number of hares which
were found there. Lastly, hares are numerous
in Lapland<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Les Oeuvres de Regnard, tom. 1. p. 180. Il genio va∣gante, tom. 2. p. 46. Voyage de la Martiniere, p. 74.</NOTE>, where they are white for ten
months of the year, and resume their proper co∣lour
only during the two warm months of sum∣mer.
Hence it appears, that every climate is
nearly equal to these animals. It has, however,
been remarked, that they are less frequent in
the East than in Europe, and that they are very
rare in South America, though they again make
their appearance in Virginia, Canada<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">La relation de la Gaspesie, par le P. le Clercq, p. 488. &amp;c.</NOTE>, in the
neighbourhood of Hudson's bay<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Le Voyage de Robert Lade, tom. 2. p. 317.</NOTE>, and the
straits of Magellan. But these North American
hares are perhaps a different species from ours;
for travellers inform us, that they are not only
much larger, but that their flesh is white, and of
<PB N="151" REF="192"/>
a different taste from that of the common kind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">La suite des voyages de Dampier, tom. 5. p. 167.</NOTE>.
They add, that the hair of the North American
hares never falls off, and that their skins are ex∣cellent,
furs. In excessively hot countries, as Se∣negal,
Gambia, Guiney<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">L'Hist. gen. des Voyages, par M. l'Abbé Prevôt, tom. 3. p. 235. 296.</NOTE>, and particularly in
the cantons of Fida, Apam, Agra, and some o∣ther
regions situated under the Torrid Zone,
both in Africa and America, as in New Holland,
and the Isthmus of Panama, there are animals
which have been called <HI>hares</HI> by travellers, but
are rather a species of rabbit<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Dampier, vol. 4. p. 111. Wafer tom. 4. p. 224.</NOTE>; for the rabbit
is a native of warm climates, and is never found
very far to the north; but the hares are larger
and stronger in proportion to the coldness of the
country they inhabit.</P>
<P>This animal, though so much in request for
the tables of Europeans, is not relished by the
Oriental nations. The flesh of the hare, it is
true, as well as that of the hog, was interdicted
by the law of Mahomet, and still more antiently
by the Jewish law. But it was much esteemed
by the Greeks and Romans: <HI>Inter quadrupedes,
gloria prima Lepus</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Martial.</NOTE>. It must, indeed, be al∣lowed,
that not only the flesh, but the blood of
this animal is excellent. The fat contributes
nothing to the delicacy of the flesh; for the
hare, in his natural state of perfect liberty, is
<PB N="152" REF="193"/>
never fat; but, when fed in the house, he often
dies merely by the load of fat he acquires.</P>
<P>The hunting of the hare is the amusement,
and not unfrequently the sole occupation of the
idle: As it requires little apparatus or expence,
and is even useful, it is a diversion universally
agreeable. In the mornings and evenings, the
hunter watches, at the edges of the wood, the
going out or returning of the hares. During
the day, he searches for them in their forms.
When the air is clear and the sun brilliant, an
expert hunter will discover, at a considerable di∣stance,
a hare that has been chanced, by the fumes
which arise from its body. Conducted by this
mark, I have seen men, whose eyes were accu∣stomed
to this kind of observation, part from
their company, and go to the distance of half a
league to kill a hare in its seat. Hares allow a
very near approach, if they are not advanced
upon directly, but by a winding and seemingly in∣attentive
motion. They are more afraid of dogs
than of men, and start sooner when they hear
or perceive a dog. Though the hares run fast∣er
than the dogs; yet, as they never fly straight
out, but double about the place where they were
started, the grey hounds, who hunt more by the
eye than the scent, generally overtake and kill
them. In summer, they frequent the fields, the
vineyards in autumn, and the woods or coppices
in winter; and, in all seasons, they may be rai∣sed
and chaced by hounds. They may also be
<PB N="153" REF="194"/>
taken by birds of prey. A perpetual war is car∣ried
on against them by owls, buzzards, eagles,
foxes, wolves, and men. So numerous are their
enemies, that they escape only by chance, and
are rarely allowed to enjoy the small protion of
time allotted them by Nature.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="supplement">
<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>It is universally known, that hares make forms,
and burrow not in the ground, like rabbits. But
I have been informed by an able naturalist, M.
Hettlinger, superintendant of the Pyrennean
mines, that, in the mountains in the neighbour∣hood
of Baigory, the hares often make holes in
the clefts of rocks, which is not considered as
remarkable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter from M. Hettlinger to M. de Busson, dated at Baigory, July 16. 1774.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is likewise well known, that hares do not
willingly inhabit places which are frequented by
rabbits; but it also appears, that rabbits do not
multiply in countries where hares are numerous:</P>
<P>'In Norway,' says Pontoppidon, 'rabbits are
found only in a few places; but hares are
very frequent. Their hair, which is brown
and grey during summer, becomes white in
winter. <HI>Like cats, they take and eat mice,</HI> and
are of a smaller size than those of Denmark<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Pontoppidou's Nat. hist. of Norway.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="195"/>
That hares eat mice, is extremely improbable:
But it is not the only marvellous or false fact
related by the good Bishop of Bergen.</P>
<P>'The hares of the Isle of France,' remarks
M. le Vicomte de Querhoënt, 'are not larger
than French rabbits. Their flesh is white, and
they burrow not in the ground. They are very
numerous; their hair is smoother than that of
our hares; and they have a large black spot
on the hind part of the head and neck.'</P>
<P>M. Adanson likewise asserts, that the hares of
Senegal are not entirely similar to those of
France; that they are somewhat less; that their
colour is a mixture between that of the hare and
the rabbit; and that their flesh is exquisitely
delicate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage au Senegal, par M. Adanson, p. 25.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>AS the hare and rabbit, though very similar
both in external form and internal struc∣ture,
never intermix, they constitute two distinct
species. However, as it has been maintained by
hunters<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">La Venerie de du Fouilloux, p. 100.</NOTE>, that male hares, in the rutting sea∣son,
pursue and cover female rabbits, I endea∣voured
to discover what would result from this
union. For this purpose, I reared together male
rabbits and female hares, and female rabbits and
male hares. But nothing was produced from
these trials. I only learned from them, that
<PB N="156" REF="198"/>
these animals, though very similar in form, are
so different in their natures, as to be incapable of
producing mules. I put a young hare and a
young female rabbit in the same apartment; but
they lived not together three months. As soon
as they acquired a little strength, they became
mortal enemies; and their continual wars ter∣minated
in the death of the hare. Of two male
hares farther advanced in life, which I confined
separately with a female rabbit, one suffered the
same fate; and the other, which was very strong,
and very ardent, perpetually tormented the rab∣bit
with attempts to cover her, and at last killed
her by wounds, or by too violent caresses. I
made similar trials with three or four male rab∣bits,
and an equal number of female hares; but
the latter died in a still shorter time. Though
nothing was produced, I am inclined to think
that they sometimes actually coupled. It is cer∣tain,
at least, that, notwithstanding the resistance
of the female, the male was gratified: And it
was more reasonable to expect fruit from these
mixtures than from that of the rabbit and hen,
which, according to a certain author, would pro∣duce
<HI>chickens covered with hair, or rabbits co∣vered
with feathers</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See l'art d'elever des poulets.</NOTE>. This ridiculous conclu∣sion
was drawn from a vicious male rabbit, which,
having no female, used a hen in the same man∣ner
as he would any other moveable. It was
extremely improbable, that two species, so
<PB N="157" REF="199"/>
remote from each other, should be fertile, while
nothing results from the union of the hare and
rabbit, whose species are so very analogous.</P>
<P>The fecundity of the rabbit is still greater than
that of the hare. Without believing, with Wot∣ton,
that, from a single pair put upon an island,
six millions were found at the end of one year,
it is certain that these animals multiply so pro∣digiously
in a country which is commodious for
them, that the produce of the earth is not suf∣ficient
to afford them subsistence. They devour
herbs, roots, grain, fruits, and even young trees
and shrubs; and, if not furnished with dogs
and ferrets, the inhabitants would be obliged to
desert these countries. The rabbit not only pro∣duces
more frequently, and in greater number
than the hare, but has likewise more resources
for escaping his enemies. He easily abstracts
himself from the observation of man. The
holes which he digs in the earth, where he re∣tires
during the day, and impregnates his mate,
protect him from the ravages of the wolf, the
fox, and birds of prey. Here the whole family
live in perfect security. The females nourish
their young about two months, and never allow
them to go out of their retreat till they are able
to shift for themselves. By this means, they a∣void
all the dangers of youth; while more hares,
on the contrary, are destroyed during this period
than in all the after part of their lives.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="200"/>
This management is alone sufficient to prove
that the rabbit is superior in sagacity to the
hare. The structure of both is the same, and
might enable them equally to dig retreats in the
earth. Both are equally timid; but the talents
of the one being weaker than those of the other,
he contents himself with forming a seat on the
surface of the ground, where he remains perpe∣tually
exposed; while the rabbit, endowed with
a superior instinct, digs for himself an asylum in
the earth. This labour is unquestionably the
effect of sentiment; for domestic rabbits never
give themselves the trouble of digging. They
dispense with digging retreats, for the same rea∣son
that domestic birds dispense with building
nests, because they are equally sheltered from
the inconveniencies and dangers to which wild
birds and wild rabbits are continually liable. It
has often been remarked, that, when a warren is
attempted to be replenished with domestic rabbits,
both they and their offspring remain, like the
hares, upon the surface; and that they never be∣gin
to dig holes for their protection, till after
they have endured many hardships, and passed
through several generations.</P>
<P>The colours of the domestic rabbit vary, like
those of all other domestic animals; for we have
white, black, brown, and spotted rabbits. The
black rabbits are rarer than the white, brown, or
variegated kinds. All wild rabbits are brown;
and, even among the domestic ones, it is still the
<PB N="159" REF="201"/>
predominant colour; for, in every litter, though
both male and female be white, or both black,
or the one white and the other black, some of
the young are always brown. It is seldom that
above two or three resemble the parents. But
the brown rabbits, though in a domestic state,
generally produce young of their own colour
only; and it is very rare, and as by accident,
that they bring forth white, black, or mixed
kinds.</P>
<P>At the age of five or six months, these animals
are capable of procreating. They are said to be
constant in their amours; and, after attaching
themselves to a particular female, generally ne∣ver
quit her. The female is almost perpetually
in a condition for receiving the male. She goes
with young thirty or thirty-one days, and pro∣duces
from four to eight at a litter. Like the
female hare, she has a double uterus, and conse∣quently
may bring forth at two different times.
Superfoetations, however, seem to be less fre∣quent
in this species than in that of the hare.
This circumstance may, perhaps, be owing to
the constancy of the females, and to their indulging
in fewer adventures and unseasonable embraces.</P>
<P>Some days before bringing forth, they dig a
new hole, not in a straight line, but angular; at
the bottom of which they make an excavation;
and then pull great quantities of hair off their
bellies, and make a bed of it for the reception of
their young. During the two first days, they
<PB N="160" REF="202"/>
never leave their offspring: They never go out
but when pressed with hunger, and return as soon
as they have filled their stomach, which they do
with surprising quickness. In this manner they
tend and suckle their young for more than six
weeks, during which the father has no know∣ledge
of them. He never enters the hole dug
by the mother; and the female, when she leaves
her young, frequently shuts up the mouth of the
hole with earth diluted in her own urine. But,
when they begin to come to the mouth of the
hole, and to eat groundsel, or other herbs, pre∣sented
to them by the mother, the father seems
to know them: He takes them between his
paws, smooths their hair, and licks their eyes.
Each of them, one after another, equally partakes
of his care and attention. He receives, at the
same time, many caresses from the mother;
and, in a few days afterwards, she is generally
impregnated.</P>
<P>I received the following remarks from M. le
Chapt du Moutier, who has amused himself for
several years in rearing rabbits: 'I began,' says
he, 'with only one male and one female. The
male was perfectly white, and the female
brown. In their posterity, which was very nu∣merous,
the brown greatly predominated; there
was a considerable number of them white and
mixed, and some black. When the female is
in season, the male seldom quits her. His con∣stitution
is so vigorous and ardent, that I have
<PB N="161" REF="203"/>
seen him embrace the female five or six times
in less than an hour. In the time of coition,
the female lies flat on her belly, with her four
paws stretched out; and she utters small cries,
which rather indicate pleasure than pain. Their
manner of coupling resembles that of the cats,
with this difference, that the male bites the
neck of the female with less violence. These
animals pay much respect to their fathers,
which I discovered by the great deference my
rabbits entertained for their original father, who
was easily distinguished by his whiteness, being
the only male of this colour which I preserved.
The family soon increased: But those who had
likewise become fathers, were always subordi∣nate
to their first sire. Whenever they fought,
either for females or food, the grandfather ran
up to them with full speed; and, as soon as they
perceived him, order was re-established. If
he surprised them in the act, he first separated
the combatants, and then gave them an exem∣plary
punishment. I had still a farther proof
of his dominion over his posterity. Having
accustomed them to retire into their apartment
upon the blowing of a whistle, when I gave
the signal, however distant they might be, the
grandfather put himself at their head, and,
though he arrived first, he allowed them all to
pass before, and entered last himself. I fed
them with bran, hay, and a good deal of juni∣per;
<PB N="162" REF="204"/>
of this last, they eat the berries, the leaves,
the bark, and leave nothing but the wood.
This food gave a fine flavour to their flesh,
and made it equally good as that of the wild
rabbit.'</P>
<P>These animals live eight or nine years. As
they pass the greatest part of their lives in holes,
where they enjoy perfect tranquillity, they grow
much fatter than hares. Their flesh differs like∣wise
both in colour and taste. The flesh of the
young rabbit is very delicate; but that of the
old is dry and hard. As I formerly remarked,
they are originally natives of warm climates.
They were known to the Greeks<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Arist. Hist. animal. lib. 1. cap. 1.</NOTE>; Greece and
Spain<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Plin. Hist. Nat. lib. 8.</NOTE> seem to be the only places of Europe
where they antiently existed. From thence they
were transported into more temperate regions,
as Italy, France, Germany, Britain, where they
are now naturalized. But, in very cold coun∣tries,
as Sweden<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Linnaei Faun. Suec. p. 8.</NOTE>, and other parts of the north,
they cannot be reared in houses, and they perish
when abandoned to the fields. But, on the con∣trary,
they are fond of excessive heat; for we
find them in the most southern parts of Asia and
Africa, as along the Persic Gulf<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">L'Hist. gen. des Voyages, par M. l'Abbé Prevôt, tom. 2. p. 354.</NOTE>, the bay of

<HEAD>OF
CARNIVOROUS ANIMALS.</HEAD>
<P>HITHERTO we have treated of useful
animals only. The noxious species are
few in number; and though, upon the whole,
what is hurtful seems to abound more than what
is serviceable, yet every thing is well ordered;
for, in the physical world, evil is subservient to
good, and there is nothing really noxious in Na∣ture.
If the destruction of animals be hurtful,
is not man, considered as forming a part of the
general system of animation, the most noxious
and pernicious of all beings? He alone sacri∣fices
and annihilates more individuals than
the whole carnivorous tribes. The latter are
hurtful only, because they are rivals to man, be∣cause
they have the same appetites, the same
taste for animal food, and because, in obedience
to this unavoidable and necessary desire, they
sometimes dispute with him that prey which he
would engross for the gratification of his inor∣dinate
appetite; for man always sacrifices more
to his intemperance than to his real wants. Born
to destroy the subordinate races of animals, he
would exhaust all Nature, if, by a fecundity su∣perior
to his depredations, she did not repair the
<PB N="165" REF="212"/>
perpetual havock he makes. But death is only
the minister of life, and destruction is the parent
of reproduction. However great, therefore, the
waste made by man and the carnivorous animals,
the fund or total quantity of life is never dimi∣nished;
for, in proportion to their premature
destruction, fresh births are produced.</P>
<P>Large animals constitute but a small part of
life: The earth teems with the smaller tribes.
Every plant, every grain, every particle of orga∣nized
matter, contains millions of animated a∣toms.
Vegetables seem to be the great fund of
subsistence; but this fund, however inexhausti∣ble,
would hardly be sufficient to the still more
numerous tribes of insects. Their fecundity,
which is equally great, and often quicker than
the reproduction of plants, indicates the superi∣ority
of their numbers: For plants are only re∣newed
every year; but a single season gives
birth to several generations of insects, especially
among the minuter tribes. Their multiplication,
therefore, if they were not devoured by other
animals, would exceed that of vegetables. But
many insects feed upon other insects: Some
tribes, as the speeders, devour indifferently their
own as well as many other species; the whole
are eaten by the birds; and the wild and do∣mestic
fowls serve for nourishment to man, or
become the prey of carnivorous animals. Thus
violent deaths are equally necessary as natural
ones: They are both modes of destruction and
<PB N="166" REF="213"/>
of reproduction; the one continues Nature in
perpetual youth, and the other preserves the or∣der
of her productions, and limits the number
of species. Both are effects depending upon ge∣neral
causes: Every individual drops at the end
of a determined period; or, if prematurely cut
off, it was because he was superfluous. How
many flowers are cropped in the spring? What
numberless beings are extinguished the moment
they begin to exist? How many germs are an∣nihilated
before they are unfolded? Man and
the carnivorous animals feed upon individuals
either completely formed, or about to exist.
Flesh, eggs, seeds, and germs of every species,
constitute their ordinary nourishment. This
waste alone might limit the exuberance of Na∣ture.
Let us attend to one of those inferior spe∣cies
that serve for nourishment to others. The
herrings, for example, present themselves in my∣riads
to our fishers; and, after feeding all the
monsters of the northern ocean, they furnish
subsistence to Europe during a certain part of the
year. If incredible numbers of them were not
devoured by other animals, what would be the
effects of such an amazing multiplication? They
alone would cover the whole surface of the sea.
But, by their numbers, they would soon injure
and destroy each other. For want of sufficient
nourishment, their fecundity would diminish.
Contagion and famine would produce the same
effects as the present consumption; the number
<PB N="167" REF="214"/>
of these animals would by no means increase;
but the number of those who feed upon them
would greatly diminish. And, as the same re∣mark
may be applied to any other species, they
must of necessity prey upon one another: Hence
the killing of animals is both a lawful and an
innocent practice, because it is founded in na∣ture,
and they hold their existence under that
seemingly hard condition.</P>
<P>It must be allowed, however, that the motives
which have raised doubts concerning this matter,
do honour to humanity. Animals, at least those
who are endowed with senses, and are composed
of flesh and blood, are sensitive beings: Like us,
they are capable of pleasure, and subject to pain.
To sacrifice unnecessarily those animals who ap∣proach
or live with us, and who, like man, ex∣hibit
symptoms of pain when injured, indicates
a cruel insensibility; for those whose nature dif∣fers
greatly from ours, cannot affect us. Natu∣ral
pity is founded on the analogy which takes
place between us and the object that suffers, and
the degree of it is proportioned to the nearness
of this conformity or resemblance in structure.
The word <HI>compassion</HI> implies a division of suffer∣ing.
In man, the sentiment of pity belongs more
to the body than to the mind; and the animals
are also susceptible of it. They are moved by
the voice of pain; they run to succour each o∣ther;
they recoil at the view of a dead body of
their own species. Thus horror and pity are not
<PB N="168" REF="215"/>
so much passions of the mind, as natural affec∣tions
depending on the sensibility of the body,
and similarity of structure. This emotion, there∣fore,
ought to diminish in proportion as different
animals recede from each other in their nature
and conformation. The beating of a dog, or
the killing of a lamb, excite our compassion:
But we feel no emotion when a tree is felled or
an oyster swallowed.</P>
<P>Animals, whose organization resembles that
of man, must have similar sensations; and the
liveliness of these sensations must be proportion∣ed
to the activity and perfection of their senses.
Those, on the other hand, whose senses are blunt,
cannot have exquisite feelings; and those who
are deprived of any organ of sense, must like∣wise
want the correspondent sensations. Mo∣tion
is a necessary effect of the exercise of senti∣ment.
We formerly proved<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sec above, discourse on the nature of animals, vol. 3. p. 208.</NOTE>, that, whatever be
the organization of an animal, if it be endowed
with sentiment, it must exhibit its feelings by
external movements. Thus plants, though pro∣perly
organized, are insensible beings, as well as
those animals who have no apparent motion. In
the same manner, animals, who, like the sensi∣tive
plant, only move their bodies, but are de∣prived
of progressive motion, have very little
sentiment; and even those who are endowed
with the power of moving progressively, but
whose actions, like those of automations, are ex∣tremely
<PB N="169" REF="216"/>
limited in number, and always perform∣ed
in the same manner, have only a small por∣tion
of sentiment, which is confined to a few
objects. In the human species, there are many
automatons: Education, and the mutual com∣munication
of ideas, by means of social inter∣course,
augment both the quantity and the viva∣city
of our sentiments. What a vast difference,
in this respect, between a savage and a civilized
man, between a female Hottentot and a woman
of fashion? Among the animals, in like manner,
those who live in a domestic state have their feel∣ings
improved by their frequent intercourse with
man; while those who remain wild preserve
only their natural sensibility, which is often
more certain, but always more confined than that
which is acquired by education and example.</P>
<P>Besides, considering sentiment entirely as a
natural faculty, independent of the movements
produced by it, we may still ascertain its differ∣ent
degrees by physical relations, to which too
little attention has hitherto been given. To pos∣sess
a high degree of sensibility, the animated
body must form a whole, not only sensible in all
its parts, but so constructed that these parts inti∣mately
correspond with each other, in such a
manner, that an impression made upon one,
must necessarily be communicated to all the rest.
There must also be a common centre, upon which
the various impressions or vibrations must ter∣minate,
and this centre must, like a fulcrum,
<PB N="170" REF="217"/>
re-act, and reflect all these movements. Thus
man, and those animals who resemble him most
in organization, will be the most sensible beings.
Those, on the contrary, who form not so com∣plete
a whole, whose parts have a less intimate
correspondence, who have several centres of
feeling, and who, under the same covering, seem
not to include one perfect animal, but various
centres of existence separate from each other,
are beings of much less sensibility. When a
polypus is cut in pieces, each division lives sepa∣rately;
the head of a wasp, after being divided
from the body, lives, moves, and even eats as
formerly; a lizard, though cut asunder, is nei∣ther
deprived of motion nor of feeling; the
limbs of a lobster are renewed after amputation;
the heart of a turtle continues to beat long after
being cut out of the body; the principal viscera
of insects, as the heart and lungs, make not a
whole in the centre of these animals, but extend
along the body, and form a succession of un∣connected
hearts and wind-pipes: All these, and
similar animals, whose organization is so far re∣moved
from that of man, have little sentiment.</P>
<P>In man, and in the animals which resemble him,
the diaphragm appears to be the centre of senti∣ment:
It is upon this nervous part, which con∣veys
the impression of pain and of pleasure, that
all the movements of the sensible system are ex∣erted.
The diaphragm makes a transverse divi∣sion
of the body into two equal parts, the supe∣rior
<PB N="171" REF="218"/>
of which includes the heart and lungs, and
the inferior contains the stomach and intestines.
This membrane is endowed with such an extreme
sensibility, and is so necessary to the communi∣cation
and propagation of feeling, that the slight∣est
wound, whether in its centre or circumfe∣rence,
is always accompanied with convulsions,
and often with death. The brain, therefore,
which has been considered as the seat of sensa∣tion,
is by no means the centre of sentiment;
for it may be wounded, and even parts of it cut
away, without destroying the animal.</P>
<P>Sensation, therefore, ought to be distinguished
from sentiment. Sensation is only a vibration,
or impression on the sense; but sentiment is the
same sensation rendered agreeable and disagree∣able
by the propagation of the vibration through
the system. The essential characteristic of sen∣timent
is pleasure or pain; for all other move∣ments,
though they pass within us, are totally
indifferent, and do not affect us. All the exter∣nal
motions, and the exercise of every animal
force, depend on sentiment, which only acts in
proportion as it is affected. The diaphragm,
therefore, which we consider as the centre of
sentiment, is also the centre of force, or common
fulcrum upon which every force is exerted.</P>
<P>All lively emotions, whether pleasant or pain∣ful,
sickness, fainting, and every sensation that
has become agreeable or disagreeable, are felt
internally in the region of the diaphragm. In
<PB N="172" REF="219"/>
the brain, on the contrary, there is no indication
of sentiment. We feel only pure sensations in
the head. We can, indeed, recal any sensation,
whether agreeable or disagreeable; and, if this
operation, which is performed in the head, be
followed by a real and lively sentiment, we im∣mediately
feel the impression of it in the region
of the diaphragm. Thus, in the foetus, where
this membrane is not exercised, there is no sen∣timent,
or at least it is so feeble as to produce
no effect; for the little motions of a foetus are
mechanical, and have no dependence either on
sensation or on the will.</P>
<P>Whatever be the nature of that matter, which
serves as a vehicle to sentiment, and gives rise
to muscular motion, we know that it is pro∣pagated
by the nerves, and that it is instantane∣ously
communicated from one extremity of the
system to the other. We know not how this
movement is performed, whether by vibrations
like those of elastic cords, or by a subtile fire si∣milar
to that of electricity, which resides not
only in animated and unanimated bodies, but is
perpetually regenerated by the motion of the
heart and lungs, by the friction of the blood in
the arteries, and also by the action of external
causes upon the organs of sense. It is certain,
however, that the nerves and membranes are the
only sensible parts of an animal body. The
blood, the lymph, the fat, the bones, the flesh,
and all the other solids and fluids are, in them∣selves,
<PB N="173" REF="220"/>
totally insensible. The brain is a soft
unelastic substance, and, of course, incapable of
producing or of propagating the vibrations of
sentiment. The meninges, on the contrary,
which serve as an envelope or covering to all the
nerves, are exceedingly sensible. Like the nerves,
the meninges originate in the head, and, like
them, they divide into branches, and extend a∣long
with their most minute ramifications. They
may be regarded as nerves rendered flat; for
they are of the same substance, have nearly the
same degree of elasticity, and form a necessary
part of the sensible system. If the head, there∣fore,
be the seat of sensation, it must reside in
the meninges, and not in the medullary part of
the brain, the substance of which is entirely dif∣ferent.</P>
<P>The opinion, that the brain is the fountain of
sensation, and the centre of all sensibility, arose
from this circumstance, that the whole nerves,
which are the organs of sensation, terminate in
the brain; and hence it was regarded as the only
part fitted to receive every impression or vibra∣tion.
This supposition appeared so simple and
so natural, that the physical impossibility which
it implies, though abundantly evident, was ne∣ver
attended to: How can an insensible part, a
soft inactive substance, such as the brain, be it∣self
the instrument of all sensation and motion?
How can this soft insensible substance not only
receive impressions, but retain them for a long
<PB N="174" REF="221"/>
time, and propagate vibrations through all the
solid and sensible parts of the body? It may,
perhaps, be replied, with Descartes and Peyronie,
that the principle of sensation resides not in the
brain, but in the pineal gland, or in the cortical
substance. But, from examining the parts of
the brain, it is apparent, that neither the pineal
gland nor cortical substance contain nerves: They
are surrounded with the insensible part of the
brain, and so separated from the nerves, that they
can receive none of their movements. Hence
these suppositions, as well as the former, fall to
the ground.</P>
<P>But what is the use, what are the functions
of this noble and principal part of the body? Is
not the brain found in every animal? Is it not
larger in man, in the quadrupeds, and in the
birds, who have all a great deal of sentiment,
than in fishes, insects, and other animals which
have little sentiment? When compressed, is
not all motion suspended? If this part is not the
principle of action, why is it so essentially ne∣cessary?
Why is it even proportioned, in every
species of animals, to the quantity of sentiment
they possess?</P>
<P>These questions, however difficult they may
appear, admit of easy solutions. Upon an at∣tentive
and unprejudiced examination, the brain,
as well as the medulla oblongata, and spinal
marrow, which is a prolongation of the brain,
are only a species of mucilage, and hardly orga∣nized.
<PB N="175" REF="222"/>
We discover in it, indeed, the extremi∣ties
of small arteries, which terminate there in
vast numbers, and carry no blood, but only a
white nutritious lymph. These minute arteries,
or lymphatic vessels, when separated from the
brain by maceration, appear like very fine threads.
The nerves, on the contrary, never penetrate the
substance of the brain, but terminate on its sur∣face;
but they first lose their solidity and elasti∣city;
and their extremities next the brain are soft,
and almost mucilaginous. Hence the brain,
which is nourished by the lymphatic arteries,
furnishes, in its turn, nutriment to the nerves,
which ought to be considered as a species of ve∣getation
issuing from the brain in trunks and
branches, which afterwards divide into an infi∣nite
number of ramifications. The brain is to
the nerves, what the soil is to plants: The ex∣tremities
of the nerves are the roots which, in
every vegetable, are more tender and soft than
the trunk or branches. They contain a ductile
matter proper for the growth and nourishment
of the nervous tree. This ductile matter they
derive from the substance of the brain itself, to
which the arteries perpetually carry the neces∣sary
supplies of lymph. The brain, therefore,
instead of being the origin of sensation, or the
principle of sentiment, is only an organ of secre∣tion
and nutrition, but a very essential organ;
for, without it, the nerves would neither grow
nor be supported.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="223"/>
The brain is largest in man, quadrupeds, and
birds; because the quantity of nerves is great∣er
than in the fishes and insects, whose sentiment,
for this reason, is feeble: The latter have a small
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, proportioned to the small quantity of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it has to nourish. On this occasion, I
must remark, that man's brain, as has been al∣ledged,
is not proportionally larger than that of
any other animal: There are species of monkeys
and of the cetaceous tribes which have larger
brains, in proportion to the size of their bodies,
than man: And this fact likewise proves, that
the brain is neither the seat of sensation, nor the
principle of sentiment; for, if this were the case,
these animals would have finer sensations and
more sentiment than the human species.</P>
<P>Plants absorb not the solid parts of earth
or water: These parts must be reduced by
heat into thin vapours, before they can be ab∣sorbed
by the roots. In the same manner, the
nerves are nourished by the subtile moisture of
the brain, which is absorbed by their extremi∣ties
or roots, and from thence conveyed to all
the branches of the sensitive system. This sys∣tem,
as formerly remarked, forms a whole, all
the parts of which have such an intimate con∣nection,
that none of them can be injured with∣out
wounding the whole. The slightest irrita∣tion
of a small nerve, is sufficient to convulse the
whole body; and the pain and consequent con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3+ letters" DISP="•••…"/>ions
cannot be cured but by cutting the nerve
<PB N="177" REF="224"/>
above the injured part; and then all the parts
upon which this nerve was distributed, become
for ever immoveable and insensible. The brain
ought not to be regarded as an organic portion
of the nervous system; because it has not the
same properties, nor consists of the same sub∣stance,
being neither solid, nor elastic, nor sensible.
I acknowledge, that, when compressed, sensation
ceases. But this alone proves it to be a body
foreign to the nervous system, which, acting by
its gravity on the extremities of the nerves, pres∣ses
and benumbs them, in the same manner as a
weight applied to the arm, leg, or any other part
of the body, benumbs the nerves, and annihilates
their sensation. It is true, this cessation of feel∣ing,
by compression, is only a suspension or a
benumbing, which vanishes the moment the com∣pression
is removed, and sensation and motion
are again renewed. I farther acknowledge, that,
by tearing the medullary substance of the brain,
convulsions, privation of feeling, and death itself,
will ensue. But these effects are produced, be∣cause
the nerves are entirely deranged, and the
whole of them materially injured in their very
source.</P>
<P>To these arguments particular facts might be
added, which would equally demonstrate that
the brain is neither the centre of sentiment, nor
the seat of sensation. We have seen animals,
and even children, born without head or brain,
and yet had sentiment, motion, and life. There
are whole classes of animals, as insects and worms,
<PB N="178" REF="225"/>
in whom the brain is not perceptible, having
only a part corresponding to the medulla oblon∣gata
and spinal marrow. It is, therefore, more
rational to place the seat of sensation in the spi∣nal
marrow, which no animal wants, than in the
brain, which is not an universal part, common to
all sensitive beings.</P>
<P>The great obstacle to the advancement of hu∣man
knowledge, lies not in the objects them∣selves,
but in our manner of considering them.
Man's body, however complicated, is more simple
than his ideas. It is less difficult to see Nature
as she is, than to know her in the dress she is
exhibited to us. She only wears a veil; but we
give her a mask. We conceal her with prejudi∣ces.
We suppose that she operates as we act and
think. Her actions, however, are evident; but
our thoughts are obscure. To her operations
we transfer the abstractions of our own minds.
We judge of her designs by our own views;
and we perpetually blend her works which are
uniform, her facts which are always certain, with
the fluctuating illusions of our own imagina∣tion.</P>
<P>I speak not here of systems purely arbitrary, or
of frivolous and imaginary hypotheses, but of the
methods generally employed in the investigation
of Nature. Even the method of experiment has
produced more errors than truths. This method,
though the most certain, requires great dexteri∣ty
of management: A small deviation either leads
<PB N="179" REF="226"/>
to barren regions, or to rare and obscure objects.
We nevertheless assemble them together, and
ascribe to them general relations and common
properties; and, as mankind pass and repass on
the crooked paths which have been formed, the
road appears to be clear and beaten. Though
it terminates in nothing, the whole world fol∣lows,
the method is adopted, and the consequen∣ces
derived from it are received as fixed princi∣ples.
I might demonstrate this doctrine by ex∣posing
the origin of what are called <HI>principles</HI>
in all the sciences, both abstract and real: In the
former, the general basis of the principle is
abstraction, or one or two suppositions: In
the latter, the principles are only consequen∣ces,
good or bad, of the methods which have been
observed. I shall here limit myself to the science
of anatomy: Did not the first man who, contra∣ry
to a repugnance of nature, opened a human
body, believe that, by dissecting and examining
its different parts, he would soon discover its
structure, mechanism, and functions? But, ha∣ving
found the subject to be infinitely more com∣plicated
than he imagined, he was soon obliged
to renounce his pretensions, and to institute a
method, not for distinguishing and judging, but
solely in order that he might see the parts in a
certain train or order. Many ages were neces∣sary
to bring this method to any degree of per∣fection;
and it alone still occupies the attention
of our most accomplished anatomists. This me∣thod,
however, is not the science, but only the
<PB N="180" REF="227"/>
road which ought to lead to it, and which perhaps
might have led to it, if, instead of travelling al∣ways
in the same narrow path, anatomists had
extended the tract, and compared the human
body with that of the other animals. What
real knowledge can be derived from a single
object? Is not every science founded on the
comparison of similar and different objects, of
their analogous or opposite properties, and of
all their relative qualities? Absolute know∣ledge,
if it has an existence, exceeds the powers
of man: We can only judge by the relations
of things. When solely occupied with the method
of investigating a subject, and when we con∣sider
it independent of what is analogous or dif∣ferent
from it, we can never arrive at real
knowledge, and far less rise to any general prin∣ciple:
In this case, we can only invent names,
and make descriptions of the object, and of all
its parts. Thus, though human bodies have
been dissected for three thousand years, anatomy
is still nothing but à nomenclature; and hardly
any advances have been made toward the real
object, which is the knowledge of the animal
oeconomy. Besides, the method itself is still
imperfect, though it ought to be clear and simple,
since it depends on inspection, and has no end
but that of denominations? As this nominal
knowledge has been mistaken for science, ana∣tomists
have been anxious to augment the num∣ber
of names, instead of limiting the number of
<PB N="181" REF="228"/>
objects. They have loaded the subject with mi∣nute
and fruitless details. They were inclined to
discover discrepances, where every thing was a∣like.
In creating new names, they imagined
they were exhibiting new objects; and the de∣scription
of a minute part, which had been either
overlooked or neglected by former anatomists,
was dignified with the appellation of a <HI>discovery.</HI>
Even the names themselves being frequent∣ly
substituted in place of the objects, with which
they have no relation, have only served to aug∣ment
the confusion. Are not the <HI>nates</HI> and <HI>te∣stes</HI>
small parts of the brain similar to the whole,
and unworthy to be distinguished by particular
denominations? These names, bestowed origi∣nally
from caprice, at last gave rise to new opi∣nions
and prejudices. Others, given to parts
which either did not exist, or were imperfectly
viewed, have been the sources of fresh errors.
How many functions and uses have been ascri∣bed
to the pineal gland, and that pretended
void in the brain, called the <HI>fornix,</HI> while the
former is only a simple gland, and the existence
of the latter is doubtful, being probably pro∣duced
by the hand of the dissector<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Steno.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>The most difficult part of science, therefore,
is not to know those things which form the di∣rect
object of it, but to strip them of a thou∣sand
false colours under which they have been
concealed, to examine the foundation and effects
<PB N="182" REF="229"/>
of the method employed by former inquirers, to
reject every arbitrary arrangement, and, in fine,
to endeavour to detect every error or prejudice
that has been adopted. All these precautions
are necessary to uncover Nature; but, to know
her, we have only to compare her with herself.
In the animal oeconomy, her appearance is very
mysterious, not only because the subject is com∣plex,
but because, having neglected those modes
of comparison, which alone could afford light,
we have been left to wander in the darkness of
vague hypotheses. The human body has been
described in millions of volumes; while the ana∣tomy
of the other animals has been almost en∣tirely
neglected. In the human subject, we
have distinguished, named, and described the
most minute parts; while we are ignorant whe∣ther
these, or even parts of greater magnitude
and improtance, exist in other animals. Particu∣lar
functions have been ascribed to particular
organs, without knowing whether the same
functions are not performed in other beings,
though deprived of these organs. So that, in the
different explications of the animal oeconomy,
we labour under the double disadvantage of ha∣ving
commenced with the most complicated sub∣ject,
and of reasoning concerning this subject
without the aid of analogy.</P>
<P>In the course of this work, we have observed
a very different method. Uniformly comparing
Nature with herself, we have traced her in her
<PB N="183" REF="230"/>
relations, in her discrepances, and in her ex∣tremes.
To mention here only those parts rela∣tive
to the animal oeconomy, of which we have
had occasion to treat, as the generation, the sen∣ses,
the movements, the sentiment, and the na∣ture
of animals, the reader will easily perceive,
that, after all the labour bestowed in discarding
false ideas, in rooting out established prejudices,
and in separating truth from arbitrary conceits,
the only art we have employed is that of com∣parison.
If we have succeeded in throwing
light upon those subjects, it must be ascribed not
so much to ingenuity or labour, as to the me∣thod
we have followed, and which we have en∣deavoured
to render as general as our know∣ledge
would permit. Before giving general ideas,
we have invariably exhibited the particular re∣sults,
or effects.</P>
<P>We shall now content ourselves with rela∣ting
a few facts, which will be sufficient to prove
that man, in the state of nature, was never de∣stined
to live upon herbs, grain, or fruits; but
that, in every period of his existence, he, as well
as most other animals, eagerly desired to nou∣rish
himself with flesh.</P>
<P>The Pythagorean diet, though extolled by
antient and modern philosophers, and even re∣commended
by certain physicians, was never
indicated by Nature. In the golden age, man
was innocent as the dove; his food was acorns,
and his beverage pure water from the fountain:
<PB N="184" REF="231"/>
Finding every where abundant subsistence, he
felt no anxieties, but lived independent, and al∣ways
in peace both with himself and the other
animals. But he no sooner forgot his native
dignity, and sacrificed his liberty to the bonds of
society, than war and the iron age took place
of that of gold and of peace. Cruelty, and an
insatiable appetite for flesh and blood, were the
first fruits of a depraved nature, the corruption
of which was completed by the invention of
manners and of arts.</P>
<P>These are the reproaches which, in all periods,
have been thrown upon man, in a state of so∣ciety,
by certain austere and savage philosophers:
Flattering their private pride, by the humiliation
of the whole species, they have exhibited this
unnatural picture, which has no value but in
the contrast: To hold out to man chimerical
ideas of happiness, may, perhaps, be sometimes
useful.</P>
<P>Did this state of ideal innocence, of exalted
temperance, of entire abstinence from flesh, of
perfect tranquillity, of profound peace, ever ex∣ist?
Is it not a fable, where man has been em∣ployed
as an animal, to give us lessons of moral
instruction? Is it even possible to conceive the
existence of virtue previous to society? Does the
loss of this savage state merit regret? Was man,
while a wild, unsocial animal, more dignified
than the polished citizen? Yes; for every evil
springs from society; and what does it import
<PB N="185" REF="232"/>
whether there was virtue in a state of nature, if
it gave rise to happiness, if man were only less
miserable than in his present condition? Liberty,
health, strength, are not these preferable to ef∣feminacy,
sensuality, and voluptuousness, ac∣companied
with slavery? The absence of pain is
more estimable than a thousand pleasures: What
is happiness, but to have nothing to desire?</P>
<P>If this representation were just, they should
go farther, and tells us, that it is better to vege∣tate
than to live, to have no desires than to gra∣tify
our appetites, to doze perpetually in apathe∣tic
slumbers, than to open our eyes to view the
beauties of Nature, and, in a word, to sink below
the condition of brutes, or to become masses of
inanimate matter attached to the earth, than to
be active and sentient beings, capable of recei∣ving
pleasure from a thousand sources.</P>
<P>But, instead of disputing, let us attend to facts:
We see not the ideal, but the real state of nature.
Is the savage inhabitant of the desert a tranquil
being? Is he a happy man? For we must not
suppose, with a certain philosopher, one of the
most ferocious censors of humanity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rousseau.</NOTE>, that the
distance from man, in a pure state of nature, to
the savage, is greater than from the savage to us;
that the ages elapsed before the invention of
words, have been longer than those which were
necessary for the perfecting of sings and of lan∣guage.
I have always thought, that, in reason∣ing
<PB N="186" REF="233"/>
concerning facts, all suppositions ought to be
banished, till every thing presented by Nature be
candidly examined. Now, we find that man∣kind
descend, by imperceptible degrees, from the
most enlightened and polished nations, to people
of less genius and industry; from the latter, to
others more gross, but still subject to Kings
and to laws; from these, again, to savages, who
exhibit as many different shades as the polished
nations. Some savages form numerous nations
subject to chiefs; smaller societies of them are
governed by customs; and the most solitary and
independent species constitute families, and sub∣mit
to their fathers. Thus an empire and a
monarch, a family and a father, are the two ex∣tremes
of society. These extremes are likewise
the boundaries of nature: If they extended far∣ther,
in traversing the numberless solitudes of
the globe, we must have discovered these human
animals deprived of speech like the monkeys, the
males separated from the females, their offspring
abandoned to the elements, &amp;c. Even suppo∣sing
the constitution of the human body to be
very different from what we see it, and that its
growth were more rapid, it is impossible to main∣tain
that man ever existed without forming fa∣milies;
because, if not cherished and attended
for several years, the whole children must have
inevitably perished. Whereas, other animals re∣quire
the care of the mother only a few months.
This physical necessity is a perfect demonstra∣tion,
<PB N="187" REF="234"/>
that the human species could neither mul∣tiply
nor exist independent of society; and that
the attachement of parents to children is natural.
This attachment must unite the parents and chil∣dren
into a small society, which alone would be
sufficient to accustom them to make certain ge∣stures,
to utter certain sounds, and inure them to
every expression of sentiment and of desire. All
this is attested by facts; for the most solitary sa∣vages
have, like other men, the use of signs and
of words.</P>
<P>Thus the state of pure nature is a known state:
It is that of the savage living in the desert, but
living in family, knowing his children, and be∣ing
known by them, using words, and making
himself understood. The savage girl picked up
in the woods of Champagne, and the man found
in the forests of Hanover, are not exceptions to
this doctrine. They had lived in absolute soli∣tude;
and could not, therefore, have any idea
of society, or of the use of words: But, if they
had ever met, the propensity of nature would
have constrained, and pleasure united them. At∣tached
to each other, they would soon have made
themselves understood; they would have first
learned the language of love, and then that of
tenderness for their offspring. Besides, these sa∣vages
sprung from men of society, and must have
been left in the woods at the age of four or five
years; for, before this period, they could not
have existed. They must have been old enough
<PB N="188" REF="235"/>
to be able to procure subsistence, but not to re∣tain
the ideas which had been communicated to
them.</P>
<P>Let us, then, examine this man of nature, this
savage living in the family state. If the family
prospers, he will soon become the chief of a nu∣merous
society, of which all the members will
have the same manners, observe the same cu∣stoms,
and speak the same language. At the
third or fourth generation, new families will
arise, who may live separately; but, being uni∣ted
by the common bonds of customs and lan∣guage,
they will form a small nation, which, in∣creasing
with time, may, according to circum∣stances,
either become one people, or remain in
a state similar to that of those savage nations
with which we are acquainted. If these new
men live under a mild climate, and upon a fer∣tile
soil, they may occupy, in the full possession
of liberty, a considerable space, beyond which,
if they meet with nothing but deserts, or men
equally new with themselves, they will remain
savage, and become, according to circumstances,
either friends or enemies to their neighbours.
But, when under a severe climate, or ungrateful
soil, they find themselves pinched by numbers,
or cramped for want of room, they will make
irruptions, form colonies, and blend themselves
with other nations, of which they will either be∣come
the conquerors or the slaves. Thus man,
in every situation, and under every climate, tends
<PB N="189" REF="236"/>
equally toward society. It is the uniform effect
of a necessary cause; for, without this natural
tendency, the propagation of the spècies, and, of
course, the existence of mankind, would soon
cease.</P>
<P>Having discussed the origin of society, and
shown that it is founded on nature, let us next
inquire what are the appetites and taste of sa∣vages.
In this investigation, we shall find, that
none of them live solely on fruits, herbs, or
grain; that they all prefer flesh and fish to other
aliments; that pure water is not pleasant to
them; and that they endeavour either to make
for themselves, or to procure from others, a less
insipid beverage. The savages of the South
drink the water of the date-tree; those of the
North swallow large draughts of whale oil; o∣thers
make fermented liquors; and the whole,
without exception, discover a violent passion for
ardent spirits. Their industry, dictated by ne∣cessity,
and excited by their natural appetites, is
confined to the making of instruments for hunt∣ing
and fishing. A bow and arrows, a club, a
net, and a canoe, constitute the whole of their
arts, and are all destined to procure a species of
food corresponding to their taste: And, what
corresponds with their taste, must be agreeable to
nature; for, as formerly remarked<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See above, vol. 3. article Bull.</NOTE>, man would
die of inanition, if he took not more substantial
food than herbs alone. Having but one sto∣mach
<PB N="190" REF="237"/>
mach and short intestines, he could not take a
sufficient quantity of such meagre food as would
afford him proper nourishment. The same
remark is applicable to fruits and grain; for,
though corns and other grains have been high∣ly
improved by culture, and contain a greater
quantity of organic nutritive particles, than any
of those which are produced spontaneously by
nature; yet, if men were denied any other food,
he would only drag out a feeble and a languish∣ing
existence.</P>
<P>View those solitary enthusiasts, who ab∣stain
from every thing that has had life, who,
from motives of sanctity, renounce the gifts of
the Creator, fly from society, and shut themselves
up within sacred walls, against which Nature
continually revolts: Confined in those living
tombs, where they contemplate nothing but
death, their mortified visages and hollow eyes
indicate perpetual efforts to support a lan∣guishing,
feeble, and useless existence. They
take food; but their hunger never abates.
Though aided by the fervour of a romantic i∣magination,
they are enabled to resist the effects
of this cruel abstinence for a few years only,
and may be said rather to die daily than to live.</P>
<P>If man were obliged to abstain totally from
flesh, he could not, at least in our climates, ei∣ther
exist or multiply. This diet may, perhaps,
be practicable in southern countries, where the
fruits are better concocted, and the plants, roots,
<PB N="191" REF="238"/>
and grains more nourishing. The Brahmans,
however, rather form a sect, than a people; and
their religion, though very antient, has never
extended beyond their own climate.</P>
<P>This religion, founded on metaphysics, is a
striking example of the lot of human opinions.
By collecting the scattered fragments which re∣main,
it is unquestionable that the sciences have
been very antiently cultivated, and perhaps ri∣pened
to a degree of perfection beyond what
they now are. It has been known, long before
the present aera, that all animated beings con∣tained
indestructible living particles, which pas∣sed
from one body into another. This truth,
adopted at first by philosophers, and afterwards
more generally diffused, would only preserve its
purity during the enlightened ages. A revolu∣tion
of dark periods having succeeded, no more
of the living organic particles were remembered
than what was sufficient to give rise to the no∣tion,
that the living principle of animals consti∣tuted
an indestructible whole, which separated
from the body after death. To this ideal whole
they gave the name of <HI>Soul,</HI> which they soon re∣garded
as a being really existing in all animals;
and, combinging with this chimerical being, the
real, but disfigured, idea of the passage of living
particles, they maintained, that, after death, this
soul transmigrated successively and perpetually
from one body to another. From this system
man was not excepted: They quickly associated
<PB N="192" REF="239"/>
morality with metaphysics: They hesitated not
to hold, that this surviving being retained, in all
its transmigrations, its former sentiments, affec∣tions,
and desires. Weak minds trembled. They
contemplated with horror the passage of the soul
from an agreeable lodging to be an inhabitant
of an unclean and lothesome animal. Every
new fear engenders a fresh superstition. In kill∣ing
an naimal, they were terrified lest they
should murder their mistress or their father.
They regarded every brute as their neighbour:
And, at last, both from motives of tenderness
and of duty, they maintained that they ought
to abstain from every thing endowed with life.
This is the origin and progress of the most an∣tient
religion of India: An origin which shows,
that truth, when committed to the multitude, is
soon disfigured; that a philosophical opinion
never becomes popular till it has changed its
form; but that, by means of this preparation, it
may prove the basis of a religion, the stability of
which will be proportioned to the universality
of the prejudice, and, being founded on truths
misunderstood, it must be environed with obscu∣rity,
and, of course, it will have an air of my∣stery,
of grandeur, and of incomprehensibi∣lity:
In fine, that fear, combining with reve∣rence,
will make this religion degenerate into
superstitious and ridiculous practices, which,
however, will take root, and produce rites that
at first will be scrupulously observed, but will so
<PB N="193" REF="240"/>
gradually alter with time, that even the opinion
which gave them birth, can only be traced in
false traditions, in proverbs, and in tales puerile
and absurd. From hence we may conclude, that
every religion founded on human opinions is
false and variable; and that, to promulgate the
true religion, which depends not on the fancies
of men, and which is constant, unalterable, and
will always be the same, is the prerogative of
God alone.</P>
<P>But, to return to our subject. An entire ab∣stinence
from flesh can have no effect but to en∣feeble
nature. Man, to preserve himself in pro∣per
plight, requires not only the use of this solid
nourishment, but even to vary it. To obtain
complete vigour, he must choose that species of
food which is most agreeable to his constitution;
and, as he cannot preserve himself in a state of
activity, but by procuring new sensations, he
must give his senses their full stretch, and eat a
variety of meats, to prevent the disgust arising
from an uniformity of nourishment. But he
must avoid every excess, which is still more noxi∣ous
than abstinence.</P>
<P>Those animals who have but one stomach, and
short intestines, are obliged, like man, to feed
upon flesh. It is an unquestionable fact, that all
animals which have more stomachs than one, and
long intestines, like the cow, sheep, goat, &amp;c.
are herbivorous, and that those who have but
<PB N="194" REF="241"/>
one stomach and short intestines, like men, dogs,
wolves, lions, &amp;c. are carnivorous.</P>
<P>It must not, however, be concluded, that her∣bivorous
animals are under a physical necessity
of feeding on herbs alone, though the carnivo∣rous
tribes can by no means subsist without flesh.
We only maintain, that the former can be suffi∣ciently
nourished without the use of flesh; not
that they would not have recourse to this food,
if Nature had endowed them with talents a∣dapted
to the purposes of seizing prey; for we
have seen sheep, calves, goats, and horses, eat,
with avidity, milk, eggs, and even flesh, when
cut down and seasoned with salt, though they
had not been previously accustomed to such food.
We may, therefore, maintain, that the taste for flesh
is an appetite common to all animals, and that it
is exerted with more or less vehemence or mo∣deration
according to their particular conforma∣tion;
for this appetite is apparent not only in
man and the quadrupeds, but in birds, fishes, in∣sects,
and worms; to the last of which, it would
appear, all flesh has been ultimately destined by
Nature.</P>
<P>Nutrition, in every animal, is performed by
organic particles, which, after being separated
from the gross mass of aliment, by means of
digestion, mingle with the blood, and are assi∣milated
to all the parts of the body: But,
independent of this principal effect, which is
always proportioned to the quality of food, an∣other
effect is produced, which depends on the
<PB N="195" REF="242"/>
quantity or bulk of the nourishing substances.
The stomach and intestines consist of flexible
membranes, which occupy a considerable space
within the body. These membranes, to preserve
them in a proper state of tension, and to counter∣balance
the action of the neighbouring organs,
require to be always partly filled. If, for want
of nourishment, this large space be left entirely
void, the membranes, having no internal sup∣port,
collapse, and adhere to each other, which
gives rise to weakness, and all the symptoms of
extreme want. Thus the aliments, before an∣swering
the purposes of nutrition, serve as a bal∣last
to the body. Both their presence and their
volume are necessary to maintain the equilibrium
between the internal parts, which act and re∣act
against each other. When a man dies of
hunger, it is not so much for want of nourish∣ment,
as of a proper poise to the body. Thus
animals, and especially the most voracious tribes,
when pressed with hunger, are so eager to fill
the internal void, that they swallow earth and
stones. Clay has been found in the stomach of
a wolf; and I have seen swine eat it greedily.
Most birds swallow pebbles, &amp;c. This is not the
effect of taste, but of necessity; for the most
craving want is, not to refresh the blood with
new chyle, but to maintain an equilibrium in the
action of the great parts of the animal machine.</P>

<P>THE wolf is one of those animals whose
carnivorous appetite is strongest. Though
he has received from Nature the means of gra∣tifiying
this taste, though she has bestowed on
him arms, craftiness, strength, agility, and every
thing necessary for discovering, seizing, conquer∣ing,
and devouring his prey; yet he often dies
of hunger; because men have declared war a∣gainst
him, put a price on his head, and forced
him to fly to the forests, where he finds only a
few species of wild animals, who escape from
him by the swiftness of their course, and whom
he cannot surprise but by chance, or by a patient,
<PB N="197" REF="244"/>
and often fruitless attendance at those places to
which they generally resort. He is naturally
clownish and dastardly; but want makes him
ingenious, and necessity gives him courage.
When pressed with famine, he braves danger;
he attacks those animals which are under the pro∣tection
of man, especially such as he can trans∣port
with ease, as lambs, small dogs, and kids;
and, when successful in his bloody expeditions,
he returns often to the charge, till, being wound∣ed,
chaced, and maletreated by men and dogs, he
retires, during the day, to his den; but issues
forth in the night, traverses the country, roams
about the cottages, kills all the animals which have
been left without, digs the earth under the doors,
enters with a dreadful ferocity, and puts every
living creature to death before he chooses to
depart, and carry off his prey. When these in-roads
happen to be fruitless, he returns to the
woods, searches about with avidity, follows the
tract of wild beasts, and pursues them, in the hope
that they may be stopped and seized by some o∣ther
wolf, and that he may be a partaker of the
spoil. In fine, when his hunger is extreme, he
loses the idea of fear; he attacks women and
children, and even sometimes darts upon men,
till, becoming perfectly furious by excessive ex∣ertions,
he generally falls a sacrifice to pure rage
and distraction.</P>
<P>The wolf, both externally and internally, has
so strong a resemblance to the dog, that he seems
<PB N="198" REF="245"/>
to have been formed upon the same model. But
he exhibits the same characters under a mask.
The figure is similar; but the result is directly
reversed. Their natural dispositions are so op∣posite,
that they are not only incompatible, but
repugnant by nature, and inimical by instinct.
A young dog trembles at the first glance of a
wolf. The odour of the wolf, though new and
unknown, excites such an aversion in the dog,
that he flies, and comes quivering to the feet of
his master. A mastiff, who knows his own
strength, though terrified at the appearance of a
wolf, attacks him with courage, endeavours to
put him to flight, and exerts every effort to get
rid of an odious object. They never meet, but
either flight or death is the consequence. When
the wolf is strongest, he mangles and devours
his prey. The dog, with more generosity, con∣tents
himself with victory; he finds no savory
odour in the body of a dead enemy; but aban∣dons
him to be food for the ravens, and even to
other wolves; for wolves eat the carcasses of
each other, and, when one is much wounded,
the others follow the blood, and assemble in troops
to despatch him.</P>
<P>The dog, even when wild, is not a fierce ani∣mal.
He is easily tamed, and attaches himself
with fidelity to his master. The young wolf
may also be tamed; but he feels no attachments;
Nature in him is too powerful for education:
With age, he resumes his ferocious character, and
<PB N="199" REF="246"/>
returns, with the first opportunity, to his savage
state. Dogs, even those of the most clownish
race, love to associate with other animals, and
are naturally disposed to accompany them: It is
by instinct alone, and not by education, that
they know how to conduct and guard the flocks.
The wolf, on the contrary, is an enemy to all
society, and keeps no company even with those
of his own species. When several wolves ap∣pear
together, it is not a society of peace, but of
war; it is attended with tumult and dreadful
prowlings, and indicates an attack upon some
large animal, as a stag, an ox, or a formi∣dable
mastiff. This military expedition is no
sooner finished, than they separate, and each re∣turns
in silence to his solitude. There is even
little intercourse between the males and females:
They feel the mutual attractions of love but once
a-year, and never remain long together. The
females come in season in winter: Many males
follow the same female; and this association is
more bloody than the former; for they growl,
chaff, fight, and tear one another, and often sa∣crifice
him that is preferred by the female. The
female commonly flies a long time, fatigues her
admirers, and retires, while they sleep, with the
most alert or most favourite male.</P>
<P>The season of love continues only twelve or
fifteen days; it commences with the oldest fe∣males;
the young ones are not so early disposed.
The males have no marked period, but are e∣qually
<PB N="200" REF="247"/>
ready at all times. They go from female
to female, according as they are in a condition to
receive them: They begin with the old females
about the end of December, and finish with the
young ones in the month of February or begin∣ning
of March. The time of gestation is about
three months and a half<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Nouveau traité de venerie, p. 75.</NOTE>; and young whelps
are found from the end of April to the month
of July. This difference in the time of gesta∣tion
between the she-wolf, who carries 100 days,
and the bitch, who carries only 60 days, proves
that the wolf and dog differ as much in their
constitutions, and particularly in one of the chief
functions of the animal oeconomy, as they do
in their tempers. Thus, the wolf and dog have
never been regarded as the same animal but by
the nomenclators of natural history, who, being
acquainted with the surface of nature only, ne∣ver
extend their views beyond their own me∣thods,
which are always deceitful, and often er∣roneous,
even in the most obvious facts. The
dog and wolf cannot copulate, or produce an
intermediate race<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See article Dog.</NOTE>. Their dispositions are op∣posite,
and their constitutions different. The
wolf lives much longer than the dog; the for∣mer
brings forth but once a-year, and the latter
twice or thrice. These distinctions are more
than sufficient to demonstrate the two animals
to be of very different kinds. Besides, upon a
<PB N="201" REF="248"/>
closer examination, we easily perceive, that, even
externally, the wolf differs from the dog by es∣sential
and uniform characters. The appearance
of the head and form of the bones are by no
means the same. The cavity of the eye in the
wolf is placed obliquely; the orbits are inclined;
the eyes sparkle, and shine in the dark; instead
of barking, he howls; his movements, though
quick and precipitate, are more equal and uni∣form;
his body is stronger, but not so flexible<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aristotle tells us, that the neck of the wolf consists of one continued bone. But this is a mistake; for the wolf's neck is composed of vertebrac, and is equally flexible as that of a dog.</NOTE>;
his members are firmer, his jaws and teeth lar∣ger,
and his hair coarser and thicker.</P>
<P>But these animals have a great resemblance in
their internal structure. The wolves copulate
like the dogs, and have an osseous penis, sur∣rounded
with a ring, which swells and hinders
them from separating. When the females are
about to bring forth, they search for a concealed
place in the inmost recesses of the forest. After
fixing on the spot, they make it smooth and plain
for a considerable space, by cutting and tearing up
with their teeth all the brambles and brush-wood.
They then bring great quantities of moss, and
prepare a commodious bed for their young,
which are generally five or six, though some∣times
they bring forth seven, eight, and even
nine, but never less than three. They come in∣to
the world blind, like the dogs; the mother
<PB N="202" REF="249"/>
suckles them some weeks, and soon learns them
to eat flesh, which she prepares for them by
tearing it into small pieces. Some time after,
she brings them field-mice, young hares, par∣tridges,
and living fowls. The young wolves begin
by playing with these animals, and at last worry
them; then the mother pulls off the feathers,
tears them in pieces, and gives a part to each of
her young. They never leave their den till the
end of six weeks or two months. They then
follow their mother, who leads them to drink in
the hollow trunk of a tree, or in some neigh∣bouring
pool. She conducts them back to the
den, or, when any danger is apprehended, ob∣liges
them to conceal themselves elsewhere.
Though, like other females, the she-wolf is na∣turally
more timid than the male; yet, when
her young are attacked, she defends them with
intrepedity; she loses all sense of danger, and
becomes perfectly furious. She never leaves them
till their education is finished, till they are so
strong as to need no assistance or protection, and
have acquired talents fit for rapine, which gene∣rally
happens in ten or twelve months after their
first teeth, which commonly fall out in the sixth
month<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See la Venerié de du Fouilloux, p. 100.</NOTE>, are replaced.</P>
<P>Both males and females are capable of gene∣rating
at the age of two years. The females, it
is probable, like those of other species, are sooner
mature for this operation than the males. It is
<PB N="203" REF="250"/>
certain, however, that they never come in season
before the second winter after birth, which im∣plies
18 or 20 months. A she-wolf, which I
brought up, discovered no marks of love till the
third winter, or more than two years and a half.
We are assured by the hunters<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See le Nouveau traité de la Venerié, p. 276.</NOTE>, that, in every
litter, there are more males than females; which
confirms the general remark, that, in every spe∣cies,
the number of males exceeds that of the
females. They likewise tell us, that some males
attach themselves to the females, after the season
of love is over, and accompany them till they
are about to bring forth; that then the female
steals off, and anxiously conceals her young, lest
the father should devour them immediately af∣ter
birth; but that, when brought forth,
he takes an affection for them, supplies them
with food, and, if deprived of their mother,
provides for and protects them himself. These
facts, however, have the air of fiction, and seem
contrary to the natural dispositions of the wolf.</P>
<P>Wolves acquire their full growth at the end
of two or three years, and live 15 or 20 years.
This fact accords with what we have already
remarked concerning many other species, that
the time of growth is the seventh part of the
total duration of life. When old, wolves turn
whitish, and their teeth are much worn. When
full, or fatigued, they sleep, but more during the
day than the night, and it is always a kind of
<PB N="204" REF="251"/>
slight slumber. They drink often; and, in the
time of drought, when there is no water in the
hollows, or in the trunks of old trees, they re∣pair,
several times in a day, to the brooks or ri∣vulets.
Though extremely voracious, if sup∣plied
with water, they can pass four or five days
without meat.</P>
<P>The wolf has great strength, especially in the
anterior parts of the body, in the muscles of the
neck and jaws. He carries a sheep in his mouth,
and, at the same time, outruns the shepherds;
so that he can only be stopped or deprived of his
prey by dogs. His bite is cruel, and always
more obstinate in proportion to the smallness of
the resistance; for, when an animal can defend
itself, he is cautious and circumspect. He never
fights, but from necessity, and not from motives
of courage. When wounded with a ball, he
cries; and yet, when despatching him with blud∣geons,
he complains not. He is harder, less
sensible, and more robust than the dog. He
runs and roams about whole days and nights;
and, of all animals, he is perhaps the most diffi∣cult
to conquer in the chace. The dog is gentle
and courageous; the wolf, though ferocious, is
timid. When he falls into a snare, he is so o∣vercome
with terror, that he may be either kill∣ed
or taken alive, without resistance. He allows
himself to be chained, muzzled, and led where
you please, without exhibiting the least symptom
of resentment or discontent. The senses of the
<PB N="205" REF="252"/>
wolf are excellent, but particularly his sense of
smelling, which often extends farther than his
eye. The odour of carrion strikes him at the
distance of more than a league. He likewise
scents live animals very far, and hunts them
a long time by following their track. When
he issues from the wood, he never loses the
wind. He stops upon the borders of the forest,
smells on all sides, and receives the emanations
of living or dead animals brought to him from a
distance by the wind. Though he prefers living
to dead animals; yet he devours the most pu∣trid
carcasses. He is fond of human flesh, and,
if stronger, he would, perhaps, eat no other.
Wolves have been known to follow armies, to
come in troops to the field of battle, where bo∣dies
are carelessly interred, to tear them up, and
to devour them with an infatiable avidity: And,
when once accustomed to human flesh, these
wolves ever after attack men, prefer the shep∣herd
to the flock, devour women, and carry off
children. Wolves of this vitious disposition are
distinguished by the name of <HI>Loups garoux</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See la chasse du loup de Gaston Phoebus.</NOTE>, or
wolves that should be guarded against.</P>
<P>Whole countries are sometimes obliged to arm,
in order to destroy the wolves. Princes have
particular equipages for this species of hunting,
which is both useful and necessary. Hunters di∣stinguish
wolves into <HI>young, old,</HI> and <HI>very old.</HI>
They know them by the tracks of their feet.
<PB N="206" REF="253"/>
The older the wolf, his feet is the larger. The
she-wolf's feet are longer and more slender; her
heel is also smaller, and her toes thinner. A
good blood-hound is necessary for hunting the
wolf; and, when he falls into the scent, he must
be coaxed and encouraged; for all dogs have an
aversion from the wolf, and proceed with cold∣ness
in the chace. When the wolf is raised, the
grey-hounds are let loose in pairs, and one is
kept for dislodging him, if he gets under cover;
the other dogs are led before as a reserve. The
first pair are let after the wolf, and are support∣ed
by a man on horse-back; then the second
pair are let loose at the distance of seven or eight
hundred paces; and, lastly, the third pair, when
the other dogs begin to join and to teaze the wolf.
The whole together soon reduce him to the last
extremity; and the hunters complete the busi∣ness
by stabbing him with a dagger. The dogs
have such a reluctance to the wolf's flesh, that
it must be prepared and seasoned, before they will
eat it. The wolf may also be hunted with
beagles or hounds; but, as he darts always
straight forward, and runs for a whole day with∣out
slopping, the chace is irksome, unless the
beagles be supported by grey-hounds, to teaze
him, and give the hounds time to come up.</P>
<P>In the country, though men, attended with
mastiffs, beat the bushes, lay snares and baits, dig
pits, and scatter poisoned pieces of meat; yet
the number of these destructive animals never
<PB N="207" REF="254"/>
decreases, especially in woody countries. The
British pretend to have cleared their island of
this rapacious creature; and yet I am assured
that wolves still exist in Scotland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See supplement to this article.</NOTE>. As there is
little wood in the southern parts of Britain, it
was a more easy task to extirpate the wolf.</P>
<P>The hair and colour of these animals vary
with the climate, and sometimes even in the same
country. In France and Germany, beside the
common wolves, we find some with thicker and
more yellow coloured hair. These wolves, more
wild, though less destructive, than the other kind,
never trouble the flocks or the habitations of
men, and live solely on hunting. In the nor∣thern
countries, we meet with some wolves which
are entirely white, and others entirely black;
and the latter are larger and stronger than the
former. The common species are very generally
diffused: They are found in Asia<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Le Voyage de Pietro della Valle, vol. 4. p. 4.</NOTE>, Africa<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Hist. Gen. des Voyages, par M. l'Abbé Prevôt, tom. 5. p. 85.</NOTE>, and
America<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Le Voyage du Leclercq. p. 488.</NOTE>, as well as in Europe. The wolves
of Senegal<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Hist. gen. des Voyages, tom. 3. p. 285. Voage de le Maire aux isles Canaries, Cap Verd, &amp;c. p. 100.</NOTE> resemble those of France, only they
are larger and more rapacious. The wolves of
Egypt<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Arist. Hist. animal. lib. 8. cap. 28.</NOTE> are smaller than those of Greece. In
the East, and particularly in Persia, wolves are ex∣hibited
as spectacles to the people. When young,
<PB N="208" REF="255"/>
they are learned to dance, or rather to perform
a kind of wrestling with a number of men.
Chardin tell us, that a wolf, well educated in
dancing, is sold at 500 French crowns. This
fact proves, that these animals, by time and re∣straint,
are susceptible of some kind of educa∣tion.
I have brought up several of them: When
young, or during their first year, they are very
docile, and even caressing; and, if well fed, they
neither disturb the poultry, nor any other ani∣mal.
But, at the age of 18 months or two years,
their natural ferocity returns, and they must be
chained, to prevent them from running off, and
doing mischief. I brought up one till the age
of 18 or 19 months, in a court along with fowls,
none of which he ever attacked; but, for his first
essay, he killed the whole in one night, without
eating any of them. Another, having broken
his chain, run off, after killing a dog with whom
he had lived in great familiarity. I kept a
she-wolf three years in a large court; and,
though shut up, when very young, along with a
mastiff dog of the same age, she could never suf∣fer
him to approach, even when she came in sea∣son.
She provoked, she attacked, she bit the
dog, who at first only defended himself, but at
last he worried her.</P>
<P>There is nothing valuable in the wolf but his
skin, which makes a warm, durable fur. His
flesh is so bad, that it is rejected with abhorrence
by all other quadrupeds; and no animal but a
<PB N="209" REF="256"/>
wolf will voluntarily eat a wolf. The smell of
his breath is exceedingly offensive. As, to ap∣pease
hunger, he swallows indiscriminately every
thing he can find, corrupted flesh, bones, hair,
skins half tanned and covered with lime, he vo∣mits
frequently, and empties himself oftener
than he fills. In fine, the wolf is consummate∣ly
disagreeable; his aspect is base and savage,
his voice dreadful, his odour insupportable, his
disposition perverse, his manners ferocious; o∣dious
and destructive when living, and, when
dead, he is perfectly useless.</P>

<P>In the history of the wolf, I remarked, that
this animal was entirely extirpated in England.
By way of recompense, it would appear, that
these voracious creatures have found out new
countries to inhabit. Pontoppidan alledges, that
they existed not in Norway before the year 1718.
He says, that, during the last war between Swe∣den
and Norway, the wolves passed the moun∣tains
by following the provisions of the army<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pontoppidan's Nat. Hist. of Norway.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Some English authors, who treat of British
zoology, have reproached me for maintaining
that wolves still exist in the northern parts of
<PB N="210" REF="257"/>
their island. I never did affirm this as a fact,
but only said<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See above, p. 207.</NOTE>, that 'I was assured that wolves
still existed in Scotland.' Lord Morton, then
President of the Royal Society, a Scotsman
worthy of the greatest credit and respect, and
proprietor of large territories in that country,
assured me of this fact in the year 1756. To
his testimony I still adhere, because it is positive,
and because the assertion of those who deny the
fact, amount to a negative evidence only<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It is amusing to see the Count de Buffon, notwithstand∣ing the repeated assurances he has had to the contrary, still per∣tinaciously maintaining, that there are wolves in the North of Scotland. He appeals to the evidence of the late Earl of Mor∣ton. We are fully disposed to give due weight to an authority so respectable, and so worthy of credit. But we are convinced that the Count has misapprehended his Lordship; for it is uni∣versally known to the inhabitants of Scotland, that not a single wolf has been seen in any part of that country for more than a century past.—Thus far the Translator had written; but, when the sheets were about going to the press, he received from a gentleman, not less remarkable for his learned and useful pro∣ductions on various branches of Natural History, than for invio∣lable integrity, the following anecdote in writing, which throws a very different light upon this dispute: 'I asked,' says he, 'the late Lord Morton, If he ever told M. de Buffon, that wolves still existed in Scotland? and Lord Morton declared, That he <HI>never did.</HI> M. de Buffon quoted to me, in 1765, in private conversation, that Lord Morton was his author, which made me put the question to his Lordship.'</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Viscount of Querhoënt, in his observa∣tions,
tells us, that there are two species of wolves
at the Cape of Good Hope, the one black, and
the other gray, with black spots. He adds, that
<PB N="211" REF="258"/>
they are stronger than those of Europe, and their
skin is thicker, and their teeth more sanguinary;
but that their dastardliness makes them less for∣midable,
though, like the ounces, they sometimes,
during the night, come into the streets of the

<HEAD>The BLACK WOLF.</HEAD>
<P>I Describe this animal only as a supplement to
the article <HI>Wolf</HI>; for both, I am persuaded,
belong to the same species. In the history of
the wolf<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See above, p. 207.</NOTE>, it was remarked, that, in the north
of Europe, there are some wolves which are
white, and others black, and that the black
kind are the largest. The wolf represented in
the Plate was brought from Canada. It was to∣tally
black, but smaller than our wolf: Its ears
were somewhat larger, more erect, and at a great∣er
distance from each other. The eyes were
likewise a little smaller, and appeared to be more
distant from one another, than in the common
wolf. These differences, in my opinion, are
too inconsiderable to constitute a distinct species.
The greatest difference is that of the size. But,
as I have oftener than once remarked, all the
animals common to the northern parts of Eu∣rope
and America differ in size; and the black
wolf of Canada being smaller than those of Eu∣rope,
only tends to confirm the general fact.
Besides, as he had been taken when very young,
and ever afterwards confined with a chain, con∣straint
alone was perhaps sufficient to prevent

him from acquiring his full growth. The com∣mon

Canada than in Europe, and the savages esteem
it for its skin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyages de Sagard Theodat, p. 307.</NOTE>. The black wolf, the lynx, and
the fox, are very numerous in North America;
and yet the black fox is very rare, and his skin
is much more beautiful than that of the black
wolf, which makes but a very coarse fur.</P>
<P>I shall only add, that this black wolf resem∣bled
the common wolf, both in figure and dis∣positions;

<P>THE fox is famous for craftiness; and he
merits, in some measure, the reputation
he has acquired. What the wolf executes by
force alone, the fox performs by address, and
often with more success. Without combating
dogs or shepherds, without attacking the flocks,
or disinterring the bodies of the dead, the fox
is more certain of procuring his food. He ex∣erts
more genius than motion, and all his re∣sources
are within himself. Acute as well as
circumspect, ingenious, and patiently prudent,
he diversifies his conduct, and always reserves
some art for unforeseen accidents. Of his own
preservation he is extremely vigilant. Though
equally indefatigable, and even nimbler than the
<PB N="215" REF="264"/>
wolf, he trusts not entirely to the swiftness of
his course. The fox knows how to ensure safe∣ty,
by providing himself with an asylum, where
he retires from pressing dangers, where he dwells,
and where he brings up his young. He is not
a vagabond, but lives in a settled domestic state.</P>
<P>This difference, though it appears even among
men, has greater effects, and supposes more power∣ful
causes, among the inferior animals. The
single idea of a house, or settled place of abode, in∣dicates
a singular attention to self. The choice
of situation, the art of making and rendering a
house commodious, and of concealing the ave∣nues
to it, imply a superior degree of sentiment.
The fox is endowed with this quality, and ma∣nages
it with advantage. He fixes his abode on
the border of the wood, in the neighbourhood
of cottages: He listens to the crowing of the
cocks and the cries of the poultry. He scents
them at a distance; he chooses his time with
judgment; he conceals his road as well as his
design; he slips forward with caution, some∣times
even trailing his body, and seldom makes
a fruitless expedition. If he can leap the wall,
or get in underneath, he ravages the court-yard,
puts all to death, and then retires softly with his
prey, which he either hides under the herbage,
or carries off to his kennel. He returns in a
few minutes for another, which he carries off,
or conceals in the same manner, but in a differ∣ent
place. In this way he proceeds till the pro∣gress
<PB N="216" REF="265"/>
of the sun, or some movements perceived
in the house, advertise him that it is time to su∣spend
his operations, and to retire to his den.
He plays the same game with the catchers of
thrushes, wood-cocks, &amp;c. He visits the nets
and bird-lime, very early in the morning, car∣ries
off successively the birds which are entangled,
and lays them in different places, especially near
the sides of high-ways, in the furrows, under
the herbage or brushwood, where they some∣times
lie two or three days; but he knows per∣fectly
where to find them, when he is in need.
He hunts the young hares in the plains, seizes
old ones in their seats, never misses those which
are wounded, digs out the rabbits in the warrens,
discovers the nests of partridges and quails, seizes
the mothers on the eggs, and destroys a vast
quantity of game. The wolf is not more noxious
to the peasant, than the fox to the gentleman.</P>
<P>The chace of the fox requires less apparatus,
and is more amusing, than that of the wolf. To
the latter every dog has great reluctance; but all
dogs hunt the fox spontaneously and with plea∣sure;
for, though his odour be strong, they
often prefer him to the stag or the hare.
He may be hunted with terriers, hounds,
&amp;c. Whenever he finds himself pursued, he
runs to his hole; the terriers with crooked
legs, or turnspits, go in with most ease. This
mode answers very well when we want to carry
off a whole litter of foxes, both mother and
<PB N="217" REF="266"/>
young. While the mother defends herself a∣gainst
the terriers, the hunters remove the earth
above, and either kill or seize her alive. But,
as the holes are often under rocks, the roots
of trees, or sunk too deep in the ground, this me∣thod
is frequently unsuccessful. The most cer∣tain
and most common method of hunting foxes,
is to begin with shutting up their hole, to place
a man with a gun near the entrance, and then to
search about with the dogs. When they fall in
with him, he immediately makes for his hole;
but, when he comes up to it, he is met with a
discharge from the gun. If he escapes the shot,
he flies with full speed, takes a large circuit, and
returns again to the hole, where he is fired up∣on
a second time; but, finding the entrance
shut, he now endeavours to escape by darting
straight forward, with the design of never revi∣siting
his former habitation. He is then pursued
by the hounds, whom he seldom fails to fatigue,
because he purposely passes through the thickest
parts of the forest or places of the most difficult
access, where the dogs are hardly able to follow
him; and, when he takes to the plains, he runs
straight out, without stopping or doubling.</P>
<P>But the most effectual mode of destroying fox∣es,
is the laying of snares baited with a pigeon,
a live fowl, &amp;c. I once suspended on a tree, at
the height of nine feet, some meat, bread, and
bones. The foxes had been at severe exercise
during the night; for, next morning, the earth
<PB N="218" REF="267"/>
all around was beaten, by their jumping, as
smooth as a barn-floor. The fox is exceeding∣ly
voracious; beside flesh of all kinds, he eats,
with equal avidity, eggs, milk, cheese, fruits,
and particularly grapes. When the young hares
and partridges fail him, he makes war against
rats, field-mice, serpents, lizards, tods, &amp;c. Of
these he destroys vast numbers; and this is the
only service he does to mankind. He is so fond
of honey, that he attacks the wild bees, wasps,
and hornets. They at first put him to flight by
a thousand stings; but he retires only for the
purpose of rolling himself on the ground to crush
them; and he returns so often to the charge,
that he obliges them to abandon the hive, which
he soon uncovers, and devours both the honey
and wax. In a word, he eats fishes, lobsters,
grass-hoppers, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The fox has a great resemblance to the dog,
especially in his internal parts. His head, how∣ever,
is larger in proportion to his body; his
ears are also shorter, his tail thicker, his hair
longer and more bushy, and his eyes more in∣clined.
He differs still more from the dog by a
strong offensive odour which is peculiar to him,
and by his natural disposition; for he is not ea∣sily,
and never fully tamed: He languishes when
deprived of liberty, and, if kept too long in a
domestic state, he dies of chagrin. He does not
copulate with the female dog<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See my experiments on this subject, article Dog.</NOTE>: If they have
<PB N="219" REF="268"/>
no rooted antipathy, they are at least indifferent
to each other. Foxes produce but once a year;
and the litter commonly consists of four or five,
seldom six, and never less than three. When
the female is full, she retires, and seldom goes
out of her hole, where she prepares a bed for her
young. She comes in season in the winter;
and young foxes are found in the month of A∣pril.
When she perceives that her retreat is dis∣covered,
and that her young have been disturb∣ed,
she carries them off one by one, and goes in
search of another habitation. The young are
brought forth blind; like the dogs, they grow
18 months, or two years, and live 13 or 14
years.</P>
<P>The senses of the fox are equally good as
those of the wolf; his sentiment is more deli∣cate;
and the organs of his voice are more pliant
and perfect. The wolf sends forth only fright∣ful
howlings; but the fox barks, yelps, and ut∣ters
a mournful cry like that of the peacock.
He varies his tones according to the different sen∣timents
with which he is affected: He has an
accent peculiar to the chace, the tone of desire,
of complaint, and of sorrow. He has another
cry expressive of acute pain, which he utters
only when he is shot, or has some of his mem∣bers
broken; for he never complains of any o∣ther
wound, and, like the wolf, allows himself
to be killed with a bludgeon without complain∣ing;
but he always defends himself to the last
<PB N="220" REF="269"/>
with great courage and bravery. His bite is
obstinate and dangerous; and the severest blows
will hardly make him quit his hold. His yelp∣ing
is a species of barking, and consists of a quick
succession of similar tones; at the end of which
he generally raises his voice similar to the cry of
the peacock. In winter, and particularly during
frost and snow, he yelps perpetually; but, in
summer, he is almost entirely silent, and, during
this season, he casts his hair. The skins of young
foxes, and of those taken in summer, are of little
value. The flesh of the fox is not so bad as that
of the wolf: Dogs, and even men, eat it in au∣tumn,
especially when he has been fattened with
grapes; and his skin in winter makes excellent
furs. He sleeps sound, and may be easily ap∣proached
without wakening: He sleeps in a
round form, like the dog; but, when he only
reposes himself, he extends his hind legs, and lies
on his belly. It is in this situation that he spies
the birds along the hedges, who have such an
antipathy to him, that they no sooner perceive
him, than they send forth soft shrill cries to ad∣vertise
their neighbours of the enemy's approach.
The jays and black birds, particularly, follow the
fox from tree to tree, sometimes two or three
hundred paces, often repeating the watch-cries.</P>
<P>I brought up some young foxes: Their offen∣sive
odour made it necessary to keep them in
stables or places which were not much frequent∣ed.
This, perhaps, might be one reason why
<PB N="221" REF="270"/>
they were less tame than the wolf, which was
kept nearer the house. At the age of five or six
months, the young foxes pursued the ducks and
fowls; and, therefore, it became necessary to
chain them. I kept two males and a female two
years. I tried in vain to make the males copu∣late
with bitches: Though they had never seen
females of their own species, and were stimulated
by the strongest desires of nature, they uniform∣ly
rejected the bitches. But, whenever a she-fox
was presented to them, though chained, they in∣stantly
covered her, and she brought forth four
whelps. The young foxes, who, when at li∣berty,
had darted on the poultry, never attempt∣ed
to touch a single fowl, after they were chain∣ed.
A living hen was generally fixed near them
for a whole night; and, though victuals were
kept from them for many hours; yet, in spite of
hunger and of opportunity, they never forgot
that they were chained, and disturbed not the
hen.</P>
<P>The fox is so extremely subject to the influ∣ences
of climate, that the varieties of this species
are almost as numerous as those of the domestic
animals. Most of our foxes are reddish; but
some of them are found of a silver gray: In
both, the end of the tail is white. In Burgun∣dy,
the latter are called <HI>coal foxes</HI>; because their
feet are remarkably black. Their bodies have
also the appearance of being shorter, because
they are better clad with hair. There are some
<PB N="222" REF="271"/>
who are really longer than the other kinds, and
of a dirty gray colour, nearly the same with that
of old wolves. But it is uncertain whether this
difference constitutes a real variety, or is produ∣ced
by the age of the animal, who, perhaps,
grows whiter as he advances in years. In the
northern regions, the foxes are of all colours,
black, blue, gray, iron-coloured, silver gray,
white, white with yellow feet, white with black
heads, white with the extremity of the tail black,
reddish with the throat and belly entirely white;
and, lastly, some of them have a black line along
the spine, crossed with another black line over
the shoulder. The latter are larger than the
other kinds, and have black throats. The com∣mon
species are more generally diffused than any
of the others. We find them in every part of
Europe<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See les Oeuvres de Renard, tom. 1. p. 175.</NOTE>, in the northern and temperate regions
of Asia<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Voyage d'Olearius, tom. 1. p. 368.</NOTE>, and in America<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Voyage de la Hontan, tom. 2. p. 42.</NOTE>; but they are very
rare in Africa, and in the countries bordering on
the Equator. Travellers who pretend to have
seen them in Calicut<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Pyrard, tom. 1. p. 427.</NOTE>, and other southern pro∣vinces
of India, have mistaken the jackal for the
fox. Aristotle himself falls into a similar error,
when he tells us<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Arist. Hist. animal. lib. 8. cap. 18.</NOTE>, that the foxes of Egypt are
smaller than those of Greece; for what he calls
<PB N="223" REF="272"/>
the small foxes of Egypt are polecats<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aldrovand. Quadrup. Hist. p. 197.</NOTE>, whose
odour is intollerable. Our foxes, who belong o∣riginally
to cold climates, have spread over all
the temperate regions, but have never penetrated
farther south than Spain and Japan<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">L'hist. du Japan, par Koempfer, tom. 1. p. 110.</NOTE>. What
demonstrates them to be natives of cold coun∣tries
is, that all the varieties of the species are to
be found in the high latitudes, and no where
else: Besides, they support with ease the most
extreme cold, and live in the neighbourhood of
both poles<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Narborough's voyage to the South Seas; Coreal, tom. 2. p. 184.; Recueil des voyages du Nord, tom. 2. p. 113.; Recueil des voyages qui ont servi à l'etablissement de la Comp. des Indes Orient. tom. 1. p. 39.</NOTE>. The fur of the white foxes is not
much valued, because the hairs fall easily off;
the silver gray is better; and the blue and cross
kinds are in great request, on account of their
rarity; but the black is the most precious; next
to that of the sable, it is the best and dearest fur.

<P>Travellers inform us, that the foxes of Green∣land
resemble dogs in the form of the head and
feet, and likewise in their barking; that some
of them are white, but the greatest number gray
or blue; that they seldom change their colour,
and, when the hair of the blue kind begins to fall
off, it grows pale, and the fur is no longer valu∣able;
that they live upon eggs and birds, and,
when they are unsuccessful in finding this species
of food, they content themselves with flies, bees,
crabs, and what they can procure by fishing;
and that they dwell in the clefts of rocks<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. gen. des Voyages. tom. 19. p. 38.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>At Kamtschatka, the hair of the fox is very
bushy, and so glossy and beautiful, that it excells
the finest Siberian furs. The most valuable are
the black chesnuts, those with black bellies and
red bodies, and those of an iron colour<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Id. ibid. p. 252.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In Norway there are white, bay, and black
foxes, and others which have two black lines on

lighted to feed upon the heads, fell a sacrifice to

<P>THE Badger is an indolent, diffident, solitary
animal. He retires to the most secret places,
to the inmost recesses of the forest, and there digs
a subterranean habitation. He seems to fly so∣ciety,
and even the light, and spends three
<PB N="227" REF="277"/>
fourths of life in his dark abode, from which he
never departs but in quest of subsistence. As his
body is long, his legs short, his claws, especial∣ly
those of the fore-feet, very long and strong,
he digs and penetrates the earth with greater
facility than any other animal. He makes his
hole winding and oblique. The fox, who can∣not
dig with equal dexterity, avails himself of the
operations of the badger: Being unable to make
him quit his habitation by force, the fox prac∣tises
every art to render him uneasy: He stands
sentinel at the entrance of the hole, and even de∣files
it with his ordure. He afterwards takes
possession, enlarges, and fits it up for his own
accommodation. The badger, though obliged
to change his habitation, leaves not his country.
He goes only to a small distance, where he digs
a fresh hole, from which he never removes but
in the night; and, as he never goes far, he re∣turns
upon the approach of danger. This is his
only mean of safety; for he cannot escape by
flight: His legs are too short for quick motion.
When at some distance from his hole, he is soon
overtaken by the dogs. They seldom, however,
accomplish their purpose without assistance. The
hair of the badger is very thick, and his legs,
jaws, teeth, and claws, are exceedingly strong.
These natural weapons he uses with courage and
dexterity: He lies on his back, resists all the ef∣forts
of the dogs, and wounds them in the most
dangerous manner. He is, besides, very tena∣cious
<PB N="228" REF="278"/>
of life, fights long, makes a brave defence,
and persists to the very last extremity.</P>
<P>Formerly, when badgers were more common,
terriers were trained to hunt and to take them
in their holes. The badger defends himself by
retiring and throwing back the earth, in order
to stop or bury the dogs. He can only be taken
by opening the hole above, after the dogs have
pushed him to the end of it. The people lay
hold of him with pincers, and then muzzle him,
to prevent his biting. I have kept some of them,
which had been taken in this manner, a conside∣rable
time. The young ones are easily tamed;
they play with the dogs, and follow the person
who feeds them. But, when taken old, they
continue always savage. They are neither mis∣chievous
nor ravenous, like the wolf and fox;
and yet they are carnivorous. They eat every
thing presented to them, as flesh, eggs, cheese,
butter, bread, fish, fruit, nuts, grain, roots, &amp;c.
But raw flesh they prefer to every other food.
They sleep the whole night and three fourths of
the day; and yet they are subject to a lethargic
or benummed state during winter, like the mar∣mottes
or dormice. This great quantity of sleep
makes them fat, though they eat but little; and,
for the same reason, they can support hunger
with ease, and often remain in their holes three
or four days together, especially during snow.</P>
<P>They keep their habitations extremely clean,
and never defile them with their ordure. The
<PB N="229" REF="279"/>
male is seldom found with the female. When
about to bring forth, she cuts down the herbage,
bundles it up, and trails it with her feet to the
bottom of the hole, where she makes a commo∣dious
bed for herself and her young. She brings
forth in summer; and the litter commonly con∣sists
of three or four. When somewhat advan∣ced,
she brings them victuals. She now travels
in the night to greater distances than formerly.
She uncovers the earth from bee-hives, and car∣ries
off the honey; she rushes into the burrows
of rabbits, and seizes their young; she likewise
lays hold of field-mice, lizards, serpents, grass-hoppers,
and birds eggs, which she conveys to her
offspring, whom she often leads to the mouth
of the hole, in order to suckle or to feed them.</P>
<P>These animals are naturally chilly: Those
brought up in the house would never quit the
corner of the fire, and often approach so near as
to burn their feet, which do not readily heal.
They are subject to the itch, and often infect the
dogs which enter their holes, unless they be after∣wards
carefully washed. The hair of the badger
is always rude and greasy. Between the anus
and tail, there is a pretty large fissure, penetra∣ting
only about an inch deep, from which con∣tinually
exudes an unctuous ill scented liquor,
which the animal is found of sucking. The flesh
of the badger has not a very bad taste; and
coarse furs, collars for dogs, coverings for horses,
&amp;c. are made of his skin.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="280"/>
We know of no varieties in this species: We
have endeavoured, without success, to find the
sow-badger spoken of by hunters. Dufouilloux<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">La Venerie de Dufouilloux, p. 72.</NOTE>
tells us, that there are two species of badgers, the
sow and the dog-badger; and that the sow-badger
is fatter, whiter, and grosser, both in the
body and head, than the dog-badger. These
differences are extremely trivial; and he ac∣knowledges,
that they are not to be perceived
without an accurate inspection<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Id. ibid.</NOTE>. This distinc∣tion
I consider as a vulgar error, probably found∣ed
on the double name of this animal, both in
Latin, viz. <HI>meles</HI> and <HI>taxus,</HI> and in French, viz.
<HI>blaireau</HI> and <HI>taisson.</HI> Besides, those species which
have varieties, are commonly very numerous and
generally diffused: That of the badger, on the
contrary, is one of the least numerous, and most
limited. We are not certain that they exist in
America, unless we regard as a variety the ani∣mal

doubtful whether the <HI>Fossa</HI> of Madagascar, men∣tioned

French badger, be a real badger, or some other
animal. It is never taken notice of by other
travellers: Dr Shaw even says that the badger
is totally unknown in Barbary<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Shaw's travels.</NOTE> It seems like∣wise
not to exist in Asia: It was not known to
the Greeks; for Aristotle never mentions it, and
the badger has no name in the Greek language.
Hence this species of quadruped, an original
native of the temperate climates of Europe, has
never spread beyond Spain, France, Italy, Ger∣many,
Britain, Poland, and Sweden; and it is
every where very scarce. The badger admits
not only of no varieties, but he even approaches
not to any other species. His characters are
deeply marked, and very singular. The alter∣nate
belts upon his head, and the fissure under
his tail, are perfectly peculiar; and his body is
nearly white above, and almost black below,
which is contrary to all other animals, whose

<P>THE Otter is a voracious animal, but fonder
of fish than of flesh: He never quits the
margins of rivers or of lakes, and often depopu∣lates
the fish-ponds. He swims with more ease
than the beaver; for the latter has membranes
on his hind-feet only, and the toes of his fore∣feet
are separate; but the otter has membranes
on all his feet. He swims almost as quick as he
walks. He never goes to the sea like the bea∣ver;
but traverses the fresh waters and rivers
to very considerable distances. He often swims
<PB N="233" REF="284"/>
under the water, and, after remaining pretty
long, ascends to the surface for air. Properly
speaking, he is not an amphibious animal, or an
animal that can live equally in air or in water.
He is not formed for continuing in the latter ele∣ment;
for, like other terrestrial creatures, he re∣quires
the aid of respiration. When in pursuit
of a fish, if he chances to be entangled in a net,
he drowns; and we perceive that he has not had
time to cut a sufficient quantity of the meshes to
effectuate his escape. His teeth resemble those
of the martin; but they are proportionally long∣er
and stronger. For want of fishes, crabs, frogs,
water-rats, or other food, he gnaws the young
twigs, and eats the bark of aquatic trees; he
likewise eats the young herbage in the spring.
He is neither afraid of cold nor of moisture.
The female comes in season in winter, brings
forth in March, and the litter consists of three or
four. Young animals are generally beautiful;
but the young otter is not so handsome as the
old. A head ill-shaped, ears placed low, eyes
small and covered, a lurid aspect, aukward mo∣tions,
an ignoble and deformed figure, and a kind
of mechanical cry which he repeats every mo∣ment,
seem to indicate a stupid animal. The ot∣ter,
however, acquires industry with age, suf∣ficient,
at least, to carry on a successful war a∣gainst
the fishes, who, both with regard to sen∣timent
and instinct, are much inferior to other
animals. But I can hardly allow him to have
<PB N="234" REF="285"/>
the talents of the beaver, or even the habits ascri∣bed
to him, such as that of always ascending the
rivers, in order to swim the more easily down
the current, when loaded with his prey<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Gesner. hist. quad. p. 685.</NOTE> that
of fitting up and flooring his house to exclude
the water; that of hoarding a store of fishes, in
case of a scarcity; and, lastly, that of being ea∣sily
tamed, of fishing for his master, and even
bringing the fish into the kitchen. All I know
is, that the otters dig no habitations for them∣selves;
that they take possession of the first hole
they find, under the roots of poplars or willows,
in the cliffs of rocks, and even in piles of float∣ing
wood; that they deposit their young on beds
made of twigs and herbs; that we find in their
habitations, heads and bones of fishes; that they
often change their places of abode; that they
banish their young at the end of six weeks or two
months; that those I attempted to tame, endea∣voured
to bite, though they were only taking
milk, and unable to eat fish; that some days af∣ter,
they became more gentle, perhaps because
they were weak or sick; that, so far from be∣ing
easily accustomed to a domestic life, all of
them which I attempted to bring up, died young;
that the otter is naturally of a savage and cruel
disposition; that, when he gets into a fish pond,
he is equally destructive as the polecat in a hen∣house;
that he kills many more fishes than he
can eat, and then carries off one in his mouth.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="286"/>
Though the otter does not cast his hair, his
skin is browner, and sells dearer in winter than
in summer; it makes a very fine fur. His flesh
has a disagreeable fishy taste. His retreats ex∣hale
a noxious odour, from the remains of pu∣trid
fishes; and his own body has a bad smell.
The dogs chace the otter spontaneously, and easily
apprehend him when at a distance from water
or from his hole. But, when seized, he defends
himself, bites the dogs most cruelly, and some∣times
with such force as to break their leg-bones,
and never quits his hold till death looses his
jaws. The beaver, however, who is not a very
strong animal, pursues the otters, and permits
them not to live upon the banks possessed by the
latter.</P>
<P>This species, though not very numerous, is
spread over Europe from Sweden to Naples; and
we find them even in North America<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See le voyage de la Hontan, tom. 2. p. 38.</NOTE>. They
were well known to the Greeks<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Arist. Hist. animal. lib. 8. cap. 5.</NOTE>, and probably
extend over all the temperate climates, especially
in places which abound with water; for the otter
can neither dwell in burning sands, nor in dry
deserts. He equally flies barren rivers, and those
that are too much frequented. I believe none
of them are to be found in very warm countries;
for the jiya or carigueibeju<NOTE N="‡‡" PLACE="foot">Jiya quae et carigueibeju appellatur a Brasiliensibus; Marcg. Hist. Brasil. p. 234. Lutra Brasiliensis; Ray, Synops. animal. quadrup. p. 189.

<P>Pontoppidan assures us, that, in Norway, the
otters frequent the salt as well as the fresh wa∣ters;
and that they live among the fragments
of rocks, from which the hunters decoy them
by imitating their voice, which consists of a low
kind of whistle. He adds, that they eat only
the fatty parts of fishes; and that a tamed otter,
which was fed with milk, brought fish daily to
the house<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Pontop. Nat. Hist. of Norway.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In some notes communicated by M. de la
Borde, I find that there are three species of ot∣ters
in Cayenne; the black, which weighs 40 or
50 pounds; the yellowish, which weighs 20 or
<PB N="237" REF="288"/>
25 pounds; and the small grayish kind, which
weighs not above three or four pounds. He
farther remarks, that these animals are very fre∣quent
in Guiana, along the rivers and marshes
where fishes abound: They sometimes appear in
numerous troops, and are so fierce that they
cannot be approached. Their bite is cruel, and
they defend themselves against the dogs. They
litter in holes which they dig in the banks.
They are often tamed and brought up in houses.
I have remarked, says M. de la Borde, that all
the animals of Guiana are easily accustomed to
a domestic state, and become even troublesome
by their familiarity.</P>
<P>M. Aublet, a learned botanist formerly quoted,
and M. Olivier, surgeon to the King, who have
long resided in Cayenne, affirm, that there are
otters in that country so large, that they weigh
90 and 100 pounds. They live in the great and
unfrequented rivers, and their heads often ap∣pear
above the water. Their cry is heard at
great distances; their hair is very soft, but short∣er
than that of the beaver, and generally of a
dark brown colour. They live upon fish, and
eat likewise the grains which fall into the water
from the banks of the rivers.</P>
<P>I have added the figure of a small ani∣mal
sent me from Guiana, under the name of
<HI>the small fresh-water otter of Cayenne,</HI> which
appears to be the third species mentioned by M.
la Borde. It is only seven inches long, from
<PB N="238" REF="289"/>
the end of the nose to the extremity of the body.
The tail of this small otter, like that of the wa∣ter-rat,
has no hair; its length is six inches se∣ven
lines, and five lines thick at the origin, di∣minishing
gradually to the extremity, which is
white, though the rest of the tail is brown; and,
in place of hair, it is covered with a rough gra∣nulated
skin, like chagreen; it is flat below and
convex above. The whiskers, and the long
hairs under the eye, are about an inch in length.
All the under part of the body and head, as well
as the fore-part of the fore-legs, is white. The
top and sides of the head and body are marked
with large brownish black spots, and the inter∣vals
are of a yellowish gray colour. The black
spots correspond on each side of the body. There
is a white spot above the eye. The ears are
large, and seem to be longer than those of the
common otter. The legs are short; the fore∣feet
have five unconnected toes; there are the
same number in the hind-feet, but they are con∣nected
with membranes.</P>

<P>MOST naturalists have described the Mar∣tin
and the pine-weasel, or yellow-breasted
martin, as animals of the same species.
Gesner<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gesner, Hist. quad. p. 76. Ray, synops. quad. p. 200.</NOTE> and Ray, in imitation of Albertus,
affirm, that they intermix promiscuously. This
fact, however, which is supported by no other
evidence, appears, at least, to be doubtful: I be∣lieve,
on the contrary, that these animals have
no intercourse, but form two distinct and inde∣pendent
<PB N="240" REF="293"/>
pendent species. To illustrate this point, I shall
give a few reasons. If the pine-weasel were
only a wild martin, or the martin a domestic
pine-weasel, the first would constantly preserve
the same characters, and the latter would be
subject to variations; as the wild cat uniformly
remains the same, while the domestic cat assumes
all sorts of colours. The martin, on the con∣trary,
never varies, but preserves its peculiar cha∣racters
as constantly as the pine-weasel retains
those which are proper to it. This alone is a suf∣ficient
proof, that those two animals are specifi∣cally
different, and that the one is not a simple
variety of the other. Besides, there is no rea∣son
for regarding the martin as a domestic ani∣mal:
He is no more domestic than the fox or the
polecats, who, like him, approach the habitations
of men in quest of their prey; and he has no
greater communication with mankind than the
other animals we call wild or savage. The mar∣tin,
therefore, differs from the pine-weasel both
in disposition and temperament; for the latter flies
the open fields, lives in the most secret recesses
of the forest, and is never found, in great num∣bers,
in cold climates: But the martin approaches
our habitations, takes up his abode in old build∣ings,
in hay-lofts, and in holes of the walls.
The species is likewise spread in great numbers
over all the temperate countries, and is even
found in warm regions, as in Madagascar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Voyages de Struys, tom. 1. p. 30.</NOTE>, and
<PB N="241" REF="294"/>
the Maldiva islands<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Pyrard, tom. 1. p. 132.</NOTE>, and is never seen in high
latitudes.</P>
<P>The martin has a fine countenance, a lively
eye, supple limbs, and a flexible body. His
movements are all exceedingly nimble; he rather
bounds and leaps, than walks. He climbs rough
walls with ease and alacrity; enters the pigeon
or hen-houses, eats the eggs, pigeons, fowls, &amp;c.
and the female often kills great numbers, and
transports them to her young. He likewise
seizes mice, rats, moles, and birds in their nest.
I kept one of these animals a considerable time.
He tamed to a certain degree; but never form∣ed
any attachment, and continued always so wild
that it was necessary to chain him. He made
war against the rats, and attacked the poultry,
whenever they came in his way. He often got
loose, though chained by the middle of the body.
At first, he went to no great distance, and re∣turned
in a few hours, but without discovering
any symptoms of joy or of affection to any par∣ticular
person. He, however, called for victuals,
like a cat or a dog. Afterwards he made longer
excursions, and, at last, he thought proper ne∣ver
to return. He was then about a year and a
half old, seemingly the age at which nature as∣sumes
her full ascendency. He eat every thing
presented to him, except salad and herbs. He
was fond of honey, and preferred hemp-seed
to every other grain. We remarked, that he
<PB N="242" REF="295"/>
drank very often; that he sometimes slept two
days successively; that, at other times, he would
sleep none for two or three days; that, before
sleeping, he folded himself in a round form, and
covered his head with his tail; and that, while
awake, his motions were so violent, so perpetual,
and so incommodious, that, though he had not
disturbed the fowls, we found it necessary to
chain him, to prevent him from breaking every
thing. We have had in our possession several other
martins of a more advanced age, which had been
taken in nets; but they continued to be totally
savage, bit all who attempted to touch them, and
would eat nothing but raw flesh.</P>
<P>Martins, it is said, go with young as long as
cats. We meet with young ones from spring
to autumn; and, therefore, it is probable that they
bring forth more than once a year. The younger
females litter only three or four at a time; but
the more aged produce six or seven. When a∣bout
to bring forth, they take up their abode in
magazines of hay, in holes of walls, which
they stuff with straw and herbs, in clefts of rocks,
or in the hollow trunks of trees; and, when di∣sturbed,
they remove their young, who seem to
grow very soon to maturity; for the one I kept
had nearly attained its full growth in one year;
Hence we may conclude, that those animals live
only eight or ten years. They have a kind of
musky smell, which is not very disagreeable.
The pine-weasel and the martin, like some other
<PB N="243" REF="296"/>
animals, have two vesicles, one on each side of
the extremity of the rectum, which contain an
odoriferous matter, similar to that procured from
the civet cat. Their flesh retains a little of this
odour; and yet that of the pine-weasel is not
bad. The flesh of the martin is more disagree∣able,
and his skin is likewise much less valuable.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="supplement">

<P>I have added the figure of an American ani∣mal,
which was sent from Guiana to M. Aubry,
curate of St Louis. Though this animal wants
the teeth, it is so similar in all the other parts of
the body to the common martin, that it may be
regarded as a variety of that species. It differs
from the martin only in having the colour of the
hair sprinkled with black and white, a shorter
tail, and spots on the head. The martin of Gui∣ana
is three or four inches longer than the Eu∣ropean;
but the tail is proportionally shorter.
The muzzle seems also to be longer; it is black,
and the blackness extends above the eyes, passes
under the ears along the neck, and loses itself in
the brown hair of the shoulders. There is a large
white space above the eyes, which spreads upon
the front, surrounds the ears, forms a narrow
band along the neck, and disappears on the shoul∣ders.
The ears are perfectly similar to those of
<PB N="244" REF="297"/>
the martin. The top of the head is gray, mixed
with white; the neck is brown, interspersed with
ash-coloured hairs; and the body is covered
with a mixture of white and blackish hairs.
These hairs are gray and ash-coloured at their
origin, then brown, and black and white at the
extremities. The under part of thejaw is of a
blackish brown colour, which extends under the
neck, and vanishes towards the belly, which is of
a bright brown or chesnut. The legs and feet are
covered with shining reddish black hair; and the
toes have a greater resemblance to the toes of
the squirrel and rat than to those of the martin.
The great toes of the fore-feet are four lines
long; but those of the hind-feet only two. The
tail is more bushy at the origin than the extre∣mity,
and the hair of it is chesnut or a bright
brown mixed with black.</P>
<P>We have given the figure of another Cayenne
animal, which seems to have a great analogy to
the former. It was drawn from the life at the
fair of St Germain, in 1768, and measured 15
inches from the tip of the nose to the origin of
the tail, which was eight inches, and more bushy
at the root than at the extremity. This animal
is short legged, like our martins: The form of
the head approaches nearly to that of the martin;
but in the ears there is no resemblance. The body
is covered with woolly hair: There are five toes
on each foot, armed with small claws like those
of the martin.</P>

<P>THIS animal is a native of northern
regions, where the species is so nume∣rous,
that the quantity of their furs annually
consumed is perfectly astonishing. There are
very few of them in the temperate climates, and
they exist not in very warm countries. Some
of them are found in the forests of Burgundy,
and likewise in those of Fountainbleau; but, in
general, they are as rare in France as the martin
is frequent. There are none of those animals in
Britain; because they have no extensive forests
in that country. They fly equally inhabited
countries and uncovered fields. They dwell in
the woods, and conceal not themselves among
<PB N="246" REF="302"/>
the rocks, but traverse the forest and climb the
trees. They live by hunting, and destroy pro∣digious
quantities of birds, by eating their eggs.
They seize squirrels, field-mice, &amp;c. They al∣so
eat honey, like the martin and polecat. They
never appear in the open fields, in the meadows,
or in the vineyards. They approach not the
dwellings of men; and they differ still farther
from the martin in their manner of making their
escape from the hunters. When the martin is
pursued by a dog, he instantly runs to his hay∣loft
or his hole. The pine-weasel, on the con∣trary,
runs a long time before the dogs, then
climbs the trunk of a tree, and, from this station,
he views them as they pass. The track which he
leaves in the snow appears to be that of a large
animal, because he always leaps, and both feet
make but one mark. He is somewhat larger
than the martin, and yet his head is shorter. His
legs are longer, and consequently he runs more
easily. His neck is yellow; but that of the
martin is white. His hair is finer, more bushy,
and less subject to fall off. The female pre∣pares
not a bed for her young; and yet lodges
them most commodiously. The squirrels build
nests in the tops of trees, with equal art as the
birds. When the pine-weasel is about to bring
forth, she climbs to the squirrel's nest, banishes
the possessor, enlarges the entry to it, and there
deposits her young. She likewise uses the old
nests of ducks or buzzards, and holes of antient
<PB N="247" REF="303"/>
trees, from which she dislodges the wood-peckers
and others birds. She brings forth in the spring,
and her litter consists only of two or three.
Though her young come into the world blind,
they soon acquire a considerable growth. She
brings to them eggs and birds; and afterwards
leads them out to hunt along with herself. The
birds are so well acquainted with their enemies,
that, when they perceive the pine-weasel, they
utter the same mournful cry to advertise his ap∣proach,
as when they see a fox. What shows
that the birds are animated with hatred, rather
than fear, is, that they follow at a distance, and
utter this peculiar cry against all carnivorous a∣nimals,
as the wolf, the fox, the pine-weasel,
the wild cat, &amp;c. but never against the stag,
the roe, the hare, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The pine-weasels are very frequent in the
northern parts of America, Europe, and Asia.
Many of them are brought from Canada, and
they extend as far as Hudson's bay<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lade's Voyages, vol. 2. p. 227.</NOTE>; and, in
Asia, as far north as the kingdom of Tonquin<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Tavernier, tom. 4. p. 182. Hist. gen. des voyages, tom. 7. p. 117.</NOTE>
and the empire of China<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Hist. gen. des voyages, tom. 6. p. 562.</NOTE>. They ought not to
be confounded with the sable, an animal whose
fur is much more precious. The sable is black;
but the pine-weasel is brown and yellow. The
most valuable part of the skin of the latter is
the brown, which extends along the whole back
to the extremity of the tail.</P>

<P>THE polecat has a great resemblance to the
martin in temperament, disposition, man∣ners,
and figure. Like the latter, he approach∣es
our habitations, mounts on the roofs, takes
up his abode in hay-lofts, barns, and unfrequent∣ed
places, from which he issues during the night
only, in quest of prey. He steals slily into the
court-yards, voleries, and pigeon-houses, where,
with less noise than the martin, he makes great∣er
havock, cutting off the heads of all the fowls,
and then transporting them one by one to his
magazine. If, as frequently happens, he can∣not
carry them off entire, on account of the
smallness of the entry to his hole, he eats the
<PB REF="305"/>
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>Plate LXXIII. YELLOW BREASTED WEASEL</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="249" REF="306"/>
brains, and takes only their heads along with
him. He is likewise very fond of honey, at∣tacks
the hives in winter, and forces the bees to
abandon them. He never retires far from the
abodes of men. The spring is their season of
love: The males fight for the female on the
roofs of houses. They afterwards leave her, and
go to pass the summer in the fields or in the
woods. The female, on the contrary, continues
in her habitation till she brings forth, and leads
not off her young till toward the end of summer.
She litters three or four, and sometimes five,
suckles them but a short time, and early accustoms
them to eat blood and eggs.</P>
<P>In the villages, they live upon poultry; and,
in the country, they hunt for prey. During the
summer, they take up their abode in rabbit∣holes,
in the cliffs of rocks, or in the hollow
trunks of trees, from which they issue out in the
night, and roam about the fields and woods,
searching for the nests of partridges, larks, and
quails. They climb trees in quest of the nests
of other birds. They lie in watch for rats,
field-mice, and moles; and carry on a perpetual
war against the rabbits, who cannot escape them,
as they enter with ease into their holes. A
single family of polecats is sufficient to destroy
a whole warren. This would be a simple me∣thod
of diminishing the number of rabbits in
places where they are too abundant.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="307"/>
The polecat is somewhat less than the mar∣tin:
His tail is also shorter, his muzzle sharper,
and his hair blacker and more bushy: He has
white hair on his front, and likewise on the sides
of the nose and round the mouth. He differs
still more from the martin in his voice; the mar∣tin
has a sharp piercing cry; the cry of the pole∣cat
is blunter. Each of them, as well as the
pine-weasel and squirrel, have a deep grunting
tone, which they often repeat when irritated.
Lastly, the odour of the martin is very different
from that of the polecat, which, instead of being
agreeable, is extremely foetid; and, from this
circumstance, the animal obtained its Latin name
<HI>putorius.</HI> He sends forth this insupportable
odour to a great distance, especially when irri∣tated.
The dogs will not eat the flesh of the
polecat; and even his skin, though good, is in
no estimation, because it never loses entirely its
natural smell. This odour proceeds from two
vesicles near the anus, from which an unctuous
matter continually exudes; and the effluvia of
it is extremely offensive in the polecat, ferret,
weasel, badger, &amp;c.; but it constitutes, on the
contrary, a species of perfume, in the civet-cat,
pine-weasel, martin, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The polecat seems to be confined to the tem∣perate
climates: Few or none of them are found
in the northern regions; and, in warm countries,
they are still more rare than the pine-weasel.
The meles Surinamensis, or stifling weasel, is an
<PB REF="308"/>

<HEAD>Plate LXXIV. POLE CAT.</HEAD>

<PB N="251" REF="309"/>
animal of a different species; and the polecat
appears to be bounded, in Europe, from Italy to
Poland. This animal, it is certain, avoids the
cold; for, in winter, he retires into the houses,
and his steps are never seen in the snow, either
in the woods or in fields which are distant from
the habitations of men: He, perhaps, is equally
averse from great heat; for he is never found
in warm climates.</P>

<P>WHETHER the ferret and polecat belong
to different species, has been a subject of
doubt with some naturalists<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Linn, Syst. ibid.</NOTE>. The resemblance
of colour of some ferrets to that of the polecat
may have given rise to this doubt. The polecat,
however, is a native of temperate climates, and
is a wild animal, like the martin. But, the fer∣ret
is a native of warm countries, and cannot
subsist, even in France, unless in a domestic state.
The ferret alone is used in hunting rabbits, be∣cause
he is more easily tamed than the polecat.
Both, indeed, have a strong and disagreeable
odour. But the most convincing proof of their
being different animals, is, that they have no in∣tercourse
with one another, and differ in a num∣ber
<PB N="253" REF="311"/>
of essential characters. The body of the
ferret is thinner and more lengthened, his head
narrower, and his muzzle sharper, than those of
the polecat. He is not endowed with the same
instinct in finding subsistence, but, at least in
our climates, must be carefully nourished with∣in
doors, and cannot exist in the fields; for those
who are lost in the burrows of rabbits never
multiply, but probably perish during the winter.
The ferret also, like other domestic animals,
varies in colour; and is equally common in
warm regions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The ferret is found in Barbary, and is called <HI>Nimse.</HI> See Shaw's travels.</NOTE>, as the polecat is rare.</P>
<P>The female ferret is less than the male: When
in season, she is so extremely ardent, that, we
are assured, she dies, if her desires be not gratifi∣ed<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gesner. hist. quad. p. 763.</NOTE>.
Ferrets are brought up in casks or boxes,
where they are furnished with beds of hemp or
flax. They sleep almost continually. Whene∣ver
they awake, they search eagerly for food,
which consists of brawn, bread, milk, &amp;c. They
produce twice every year: The female goes six
weeks with young: Some of them devour their
young as soon as they are brought forth, instantly
come again in season, and have three litters,
which generally consist of five or six, and some∣times
seven or eight, and even nine.</P>
<P>This animal is by nature a mortal enemy to
the rabbit. Whenever a dead rabbit is, for the
first time, presented to a young ferret, he flies
<PB N="254" REF="312"/>
upon it, and bites it with fury; but, if it be
alive, he seizes it by the throat or the nose, and
sucks its blood. When let into the burrows of
rabbits, he is muzzled, that he may not kill them
in their holes, but only oblige them to come out,
in order to be caught in the nets. If the ferret
is let in without a muzzle, he is in danger of
being lost; for, after sucking the blood of the
rabbit, he falls asleep; and even smoking the hole
is not a certain method of recalling him; be∣cause
the holes have often several entries which
communicate with each other, and the ferret re∣tires
into one of these, when incommoded with
the smoke. Boys likewise use the ferret for
catching birds in the holes of walls or of old
trees.</P>
<P>According to Strabo, the ferret was brought
from Africa into Spain; which is by no means
improbable, as Spain is the native climate of rab∣bits,
and the country where formerly these ani∣mals
most abounded. It may, therefore, be pre∣sumed,
that, in order to diminish their number,
which perhaps was incommodious, ferrets were
imported for the purpose of hunting rabbits in a
profitable manner, in place of multiplying mar∣tins,
which would have destroyed the rabbits
without bringing any advantage to the hunters.</P>
<P>The ferret, though easily tamed and rendered
docile, is extremely irascible. His odour is al∣ways
disagreeable; but, when he is irritated, it
becomes much more offensive. His eyes are
<PB N="255" REF="313"/>
lively, and his aspect is inflammatory; all his
movements are nimble, and he is, at the same
time, so vigorous, that he can easily master a
rabbit, though at least four times larger than
himself.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the authority of commenta∣tors,
it is still uncertain whether the ferret be the
<HI>ictis</HI> of the Greeks. 'The ictis,' says Aristotle,
'is a species of wild weasel, smaller than the
little Maltese dog, but resembling the weasel
in its hair, in the whiteness of the under part
of the body, and likewise in the craftiness of
its manners. It admits of being tamed; and
makes great havock among the bee-hives, be∣ing
extremely found of honey. It also attacks
birds, and, like the cat, has an osseous penis<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. anim. lib. 9. cap. 6.</NOTE>.'
1. There appears to be a contradiction in saying
that the ictis is a species of wild weasel, which
admits of being tamed; for the common weasel,
which, in this country, is the most savage of the
two, is perfectly irreclaimable. 2. The ferret,
though larger than the weasel, can never be com∣pared,
for size, to the lap-dog. 3. The ferret
appears not to have the cunning of the weasel,
nor indeed any craftiness at all: Lastly, he never
attacks the bee-hives, nor is he fond of honey.
I inquired of M. le Roi, inspector of the royal
chaces, concerning this last fact. His answer
follows: 'M. de Buffon may be assured, that
the ferrets have no predilection for honey;
<PB N="256" REF="314"/>
but, when hungry, may be made to eat to it.
I have fed them several days with bread soak∣ed
in water mixed with honey. The two last
days, they eat it in pretty large quantities; but
the weakest of them began to be sensibly ema∣ciated.'
This is not the first time that M. le
Roi has obliged me with important facts. Ha∣ving
no ferrets, I tried the same experiment on
the ermine, by giving him only pure honey to
eat, and a little milk for drink: But he died
in a few days. Thus neither the ermine nor the
ferret are fond of honey, like the ictis of the
antients; which inclines me to think, that the
word <HI>ictis</HI> is perhaps only a generic name; or,
if it marks any particular species, it ought rather
to be applied to the martin or polecat, both of
which possess the craftiness of the weasel, attack
the bee-hives, and are extremely fond of honey.</P>

<P>THE Weasel is as common in temperate and
warm climates<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The weasel is found in Barbary, and is called <HI>Fert<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el Ste<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2+ letters" DISP="••…"/></HI>; Shaw's travels.</NOTE>, as it is rare in the nor∣thern
regions. The ermine, on the contrary, a∣bounds
in the north, is seldom met with in
temperate climates, and never in warm countries.
These animals, therefore, form two distinct spe∣cies.
The common weasel sometimes turns
white during the winter, even in our climate.
This circumstance might give rise to its being
regarded as of the same species with the ermine.
This mark is common to both: But there are
others in which they differ. The ermine is red∣dish
in summer and white in winter; but the
end of its tail is uniformly black. The end of
the weasel's tail is yellow, even when the animal
<PB N="258" REF="318"/>
turns white in winter. It is, besides, always
less, and its tail much shorter than that of the
ermine. The weasel dwells not, like the er∣mine,
in woods and deserts, but near the habi∣tations
of men. I have kept both species toge∣ther;
but animals which differ in climate, in
constitution, and in disposition, never intermix.
It is true, some weasels are larger or smaller than
others; but the difference never exceeds an inch
in the whole length of the body. But the er∣mine
is two inches longer than the largest wea∣sel.
Neither of them can be tamed, but are
kept wild in iron cages. Neither of them
voluntarily eat honey, nor attack the bee∣hives,
like the polecat and martin. Thus
the ermine is not the savage weasel, nor the
ictis of Aristotle, which, he says, is easily
tamed, and very fond of honey. The weasel
and ermine, instead of being easily tamed, are so
wild, that they will not eat when any person
looks at them: They are in perpetual agitation,
always endeavouring to conceal themselves: And,
if a man wants to keep them, he must furnish
them with a bundle of wool or flax, in which
they wrap and hide themselves from the light.
Thither they drag every thing they can lay hold
of, and never eat but in the night. They allow
fresh meat to lie three or four days, and even till
it corrupt, before they touch it. They sleep
three fourths of the day, and watch their prey
during the night. When a weasel gets among
the poultry, he attacks not the cocks or old hens,
<PB N="259" REF="319"/>
but singles out the chickens and young birds,
whom he kills with a single bite on the head,
and then carries off the whole one by one. He
likewise breaks the eggs, and sucks them with
incredible avidity. In winter, they generally
live in granaries and barns, where they often re∣main
during the spring, and bring forth their
young among the hay and straw. During this
period, the female makes war, with more success
than the cat, against the rats and mice, who can∣not
escape her, because she follows them into
their holes. She mounts the pigeon-houses,
and destroys the pigeons, sparrows, &amp;c. In
summer, they retire farther from houses, especi∣ally
into low grounds, about mills, along rivu∣lets,
conceal themselves among brush-wood, in
order to surprise birds, and often take up their
abode in old willows, where the female brings
forth her young: She prepares for them a bed
of straw, leaves, and other herbage, and litters,
in the spring, from three to five. The young,
like those of the polecat, pine-weasel, and mar∣tin,
are born blind; but they very soon acquire
growth and strength enough to follow their mo∣ther
in the chace. The weasels attack serpents,
water-rats, moles, field-mice, &amp;c. and, over∣running
the meadows, they devour quails and
partridges, together with their eggs. Their mo∣tion
consists of inequal and precipitant leaps;
and, when they want to mount a tree, they make
a sudden bound, by which they are at once ele∣vated
<PB N="260" REF="320"/>
several feet high. They leap in the same
manner when they attempt to seize a bird.</P>
<P>These animals, as well as the polecat and fer∣ret,
have a disagreeable odour, which is stronger
in summer than in winter; and, when pursued
or irritated, their smell is felt at a considerable
distance. They move always with caution and
with silence, and never cry, but when they are
hurt. Their cry is sharp, rough, and very ex∣pressive
of resentment. As their own odour is
offensive, they seem not to be sensible of a bad
smell in other bodies. A peasant in my neigh∣bourhood
took three new-littered weasels out of
the carcass of a wolf that had been hung on a
tree by the hind feet. The wolf was almost en∣tirely
putrified, and the female weasel had made
a nest of leaves and herbage for her young in
the thorax of this putrid carcass.</P>

<P>The author here ingenuously quotes a letter
he received from the Countess of Noyan, dated
at the Castle of Manceliere in Britany, July
20. 1771, in which that Lady assures him,
that he had injured the character of the weasel,
by alledging, that no art could reclaim or ren∣der
him docile; because she had tried the expe∣riment
upon a young weasel taken in her gar∣den,
<PB N="261" REF="321"/>
who soon learned to recognise and to lick
the hand from which it received its food, and
became as familiar, caressing, and frolicksome,
as a dog or squirrel.</P>
<P>This fact the author had still farther confirm∣ed
by a similar experiment made by M. Giely
de Mornas, who trained a young weasel so com∣pletely,
that the animal followed him wherever
he went. The method of taming them is, to
stroke them often and gently over the back, and
to threaten, and even beat them, when they bite.
Their odour is never offensive, but when they
are irritated. They are fed with milk, boiled
flesh, and water; and, unless they be starved,
never eat honey, although presented to them.</P>

<P>THE weasel with a black tail, is called the
<HI>ermine,</HI> and <HI>roselet</HI> by the French; the
<HI>ermine</HI> when it is white, and the <HI>roselet</HI> when it
is red or yellowish. Though less frequent than
the ordinary weasel, they are still found in con∣siderable
numbers, especially in the antient fo∣rests,
and sometimes, during winter, in fields
bordering upon woods. It is easy, at all seasons,
to distinguish them from the common weasel;
<PB N="263" REF="323"/>
for the end of their tail is always of a deep black,
and the borders of the ears and toes are white.</P>
<P>We have little to add to what we formerly
remarked concerning this animal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See above, article Weasel.</NOTE>. We shall
only observe, that it changes its colour, as usual,
in winter. I had one sent me, in the beginning of
March 1757, which was then white. I kept it
till April 1758, when it would probably have
become white, had it been at liberty; but it was
confined in an iron cage, against the bars of
which it perpetually rubbed, and, as it had not
been sufficiently exposed to the cold, it still pre∣served
its summer coat. It remains as savage as
ever, and has lost nothing of its bad smell. In
every other circumstance, it is a healthy vivaci∣ous
animal, has lively eyes, a fine countenance,
and movements so rapid, that it is impossible to
follow them with the eye. It has always been
fed with eggs and flesh; but it touches not meat
till it has become putrid. It never inclined to
eat honey; and, being deprived of victuals for
three days, it died, after having taken a small
quantity of honey. The skin of this animal is
very precious. The furs of the ermine are finer
and fairer than those of the white rabbit; but
they soon turn yellowish; and, indeed, the er∣mines
of our climate have always a slight tincture
of yellow.</P>
<P>This animal is very frequent in the north, e∣specially
in Russia, Norway, and Lapland<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Oeuvres de Regnard, tom. 1. p. 178.</NOTE>, where,
<PB N="264" REF="324"/>
as in every other place, they are reddish in sum∣mer
and white in winter. They feed upon small
animals, and particularly a species of rat, which
abounds in Norway and Lapland, to be after∣wards
mentioned. The ermines are rare in tem∣perate
climates, and are never found in warm
countries. The Cape animal, called the <HI>ermine</HI>
by Kolbe<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Descript. du Cap de Bonne-esperance, p. 54.</NOTE>, and whose flesh, he remarks, is
wholesome and agreeable to the palate, has no
affinity to the ermine. The weasels of Cayenne,
described by M. Barrere<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Descript. de la France equinoctiale.</NOTE>, and the gray ermines
of Tartary, and of the northern parts of China,
mentioned by some travellers<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Hist. gen. des Voyages, tom. 6. p. 565.—603.</NOTE>, are also animals
different from our weasels and ermines.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="supplement">
<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>In the natural history of Norway by Pontop∣pidan,
we have the following remarks.</P>
<P>'In Norway, the ermine lives among the frag∣ments
of rocks. This animal seems to belong
to the weasel tribe. His skin is white, except
the tail, which is spotted with black. The furs
of Norway and Lapland preserve their white∣ness
better than those of Russia, which sooner
turn yellowish; and, for this reason, the for∣mer
are of greater request, even at Petersburg.
The ermine catches mice like the cat, and,

when practicable, carries off his prey. He is
particularly fond of eggs, and, when the sea is
calm, he swims over to the islands which lie near
the coast of Norway, where there are vast
quantities of sea fowls. It is alledged, that,
when the female brings forth on an island, she
conducts her young to the continent, upon a
piece of wood, piloting them with her snout.
This animal, though small, kills those of a
much larger size, as the rein-deer and bear.
He jumps into one of their ears when they
are asleep, and adheres so fast by his teeth,
that the creatures cannot disengage him. He
likewise surprises eagles and heath-cocks, by
fixing on them, and never quitting them, even
when they mount in the air, till the loss of
blood makes them fall down.'</P>

<HEAD>The GRISON, or GRAY WEASEL<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A new animal from Buston's Supplement.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>THIS animal is analagous to the weasel and
ermine. M. Allamand gave the first de∣scription
and figure of it under the name
of the <HI>grison,</HI> in the 15th volume of the Dutch
edition of my work, which he describes in the
following manner.</P>
<P>'I received,' says he, 'from Surinam, the
small animal represented in the plate<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Edition de Holande, tom. 15.</NOTE>. In the
catalogue it was called the <HI>gray weasel,</HI> from
which circumstance I derived the name <HI>grison,</HI>
because I know not how it is denominated in
the country where it is found. The whole up∣per
part of its body is covered with deep brown
hair, having white points, which gives a gray∣ish
brown colour: Under the head and neck is
a bright gray, because the hairs there are very
short, and the white part is of equal length
with the brown. The muzzle, the under part
of the body and legs, are black; which singu∣larly
contrasts with the gray colour on the
head and neck.'</P>
<P>'The head of this animal is very large in pro∣portion
to its body; its ears form almost a semi∣circle;
its eyes are large; and its mouth is

<P>'The grison has a greater resemblance to the

not to the weasel tribe; for its body is not
long enough, and its legs are too long. It is
not mentioned by any author or traveller. I
shewed it to several persons who had lived
long in Surinam; but none of them knew it;
hence it either must be a rare animal, even in
its native country, or it must live only in de∣sert

its body is about seven inches. I have not

<P>THE squirrel is a little neat animal, and may
be considered as in a state between savage
and domestic. The gentleness, docility, and
inoffensiveness of his manners, entitle him to re∣gard
and protection. Though he sometimes
seizes birds, he is neither carnivorous nor destruc∣tive.
Fruits, almonds, nuts, beech-mast, and a∣corns,
are his common food. He is handsome,
lively, alert, and extremely vigilant and indu∣strious.
He has eyes full of fire, a fine counte∣nance,
a nervous body, and very nimble limbs.
The beauty of his figure is heightened by a tail
<PB N="269" REF="332"/>
resembling a plume of feathers, which he
raises the length of his head, and under which
he shades himself from the sun and weather.
The under part of his body is furnished with an
apparatus equally remarkable, and which indi∣cates
strong generative powers. The squirrel
partakes less of the nature of quadrupeds than
most others of that tribe. He generally rests
almost on end, and uses his fore-feet like hands,
in carrying his food to his mouth. Instead of
concealing himself under the earth, he is perpe∣tually
in the air. He approaches the birds by
his lightness; and, like the feathered tribes, he
dwells on the tops of trees, and traverses the forests
by leaping from one tree to another. He like∣wise
builds his nest in the trees, gathers grains
and seeds, drinks the dews, and descends not to the
earth, but when the trees are agitated by storms.
He is never found in the open fields, nor in the
plains. He approaches not the habitations of
men, and never remains among brushwood; but
delights in the lofty trees of the forest. Of wa∣ter
he is still more afraid than of the earth; and
we are assured, that, when he wants to pass a ri∣ver
or lake, he employs the bark of a tree for a
ship, and uses his tail for the rudder and sails<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rei veritate nititur quod Gesnerus ex Vincentio Beluan∣censi et Olao Magno refert, sciuros, quando aquam transire cupiunt, lignum levissimum aquae imponere; eique insidentes, et cauda, non tamen ut vult, erecta, sed continuo mota, velifi∣cantes neque flante vento, sed tranquillo aequore transvehi, quod fide dignus, fidusque meus emissarius ad insulas Goth∣landiae, plus simplici vice observavit, et cum spoliis in littori∣bus ibidem collectis redux mirabundus mihi retulit; <HI>Dissert. de Sciuro volante.

He sleeps not, like the dormouse, during the
winter, but is at all seasons awake and lively;
and, if the foot of the tree where he reposes be
touched, he instantly leaves his little nest, and
flies to another tree, or shelters himself under a
branch. He collects nuts during summer, hides
them in the trunks or hollows of old trees, and
has recourse to them for his winter food: He like∣wise
searches for them in the snow, and scratches
off the surface of it with his feet. His voice
is shrill, and still more piercing than that of the
martin. When irritated, he makes a murmur∣ing
or grumbling noise. He is too light for
walking; his movements consist of little leaps;
and sometimes he makes considerable bounds.
His claws are so sharp, and his motion so quick,
that he instantaneously climbs beech trees, though
their bark be exceedingly smooth.</P>
<P>During the fine summer nights, the squirrels
are heard crying, when pursuing each other a∣mong
the trees. They seem to dread the heat
of the sun; for, during the day, they remain in
their nests, from which they issue, in the night,
to eat, to frolick, and to make love. Their habita∣tion
is clean, warm, impenetrable to rain, and
generally situated in the cleft of a tree. They
begin the work by carrying small sticks,
<PB N="271" REF="334"/>
which they mix and interlace with moss: They
then press and stamp it, to give it firmness and
capacity for holding themselves and their young.
Only a small strait aperture is left near the top,
hardly sufficient to allow them to pass. Above
this aperture is a conical cover which shelters the
whole, and makes the rain run off the sides.
They generally produce three or four at a litter:
The females come in season in the spring, and
bring forth in May, or the beginning of June.
They cast their hair in winter, and the new fur
is redder than the former. They comb and
dress themselves with their hands and teeth, are
very cleanly, and have no bad smell. Their
flesh makes pretty good eating. The hair of
their tail is used for pencils; but their skin is
only an indifferent fur.</P>
<P>Several species of quadrupeds border upon
that of the squirrel; but there are few varieties
in the species itself. Some are of an ash-colour;
but the greatest number are reddish. The small
gray kind is a different species, and continues
always gray: And, without mentioning the fly∣ing
squirrels, the white squirrel of Cambaia<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Les voyages de Pietro della Valle, tom. 6. p. 368.</NOTE>,

<P>Squirrels should be considered rather as na∣tives
of northern regions, than of temperate cli∣mates;
for they abound so much in Siberia, that
immense numbers of their skins are annually sold
in that country. The Siberians, says M. Gmelin,
take the squirrels in traps, made nearly in the
form of a fourth figure, which are suspended on
the trees, and baited with a piece of dried fish<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Voyage de M. Gmelin in Siberie, tom. 2. p. 232.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It was formerly remarked, that there are black
squirrels in America. M. Aubry, curate of Saint-Louis,
has, in his cabinet, a squirrel, sent him
from Martinico, which is totally black. It is also
<PB N="273" REF="336"/>
distinguished from other squirrels by having no
hair, or at least a very small quantity, on its ears.</P>
<P>M. de la Borde, King's physician at Cayenne,
remarks, that, in Guiana, there is only one spe∣cies
of squirrel, which lives in the woods; that
its hair is reddish; that it exceeds not the size of
an European rat; that it feeds on the grain of
the <HI>Maripa, Aoura, Comana,</HI> &amp;c.; that it brings
forth its young to the number of two, in the
holes of trees; that it bites like a rat; that it is
easily tamed; that it makes a kind of low whis∣tling
cry; and that it is always seen alone, leap∣ing
from branch to branch.</P>
<P>I am not certain that this animal, mentioned
by M. de la Borde, is a real squirrel; for these
animals, in general, are not found in very warm
climates, such as that of Guiana. The species,
on the contrary, is very numerous in the cold
and temperate regions of both Continents.</P>
<P>'We find,' says M. Kalm, 'several species of
squirrels in Pensylvania, where the small kind,
called the <HI>ground-squirrel,</HI> is preferred; be∣cause,
though difficult to tame, it is most hand∣some.
The large squirrels do much mischief
to the plantations of maize. They cut the
stems, in order to eat the pith. They some∣times
come in hundreds into a field, and often
devour the whole wheat in a single night. In
order to destroy them, a price is put upon their
heads. The inhabitants eat the flesh of the
squirrels, but put little value on their skins<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Kalm, tom. 2. p. 245.</NOTE>.
<PB N="274" REF="337"/>
The gray squirrels are common in Pensylvania,
and in several other parts of North America.
In figure, they resemble those of Sweden; but,
both in summer and winter, they preserve their
gray colour, and are likewise somewhat larger.
They build their nests with moss and straw in
the hollows of trees. They feed upon the
fruits of the woods, but prefer the maize. They
lay up provisions for winter, and remain in
their magazines during the great colds. These
animals not only do much injury to the maize,
but likewise to the oaks, the flowers of which
they devour, so that the trees produce few a∣corns. . . . . It is alledged, that they are
now more numerous in Pensylvania than for∣merly,
and that they have multiplied in pro∣portion
to the increase of the plantations of
maize, which is their principal food.'</P>

<P>NATURE, by descending gradually from
great to small, from strong to weak, coun∣terbalances
every part of her works. Attentive
solely to the preservation of each species, she
creates a profusion of individuals, and supports
by numbers the small and the feeble, whom she
hath left unprovided with arms or with courage.
She has not only put those inferior animals in a
condition to perpetuate and to resist by their own
numbers, but she seems, at the same time, to
have afforded a supply to each by multiplying
the neighbouring species. The rat, the mouse,
the field-mouse, the water-rat, the short tailed
<PB N="276" REF="340"/>
field mouse, the fat squirrel, the garden squirrel,
the dormouse, the shrew-mouse, and several o∣thers,
whom I mention not, because they belong
not to our climate, form so many distinct and
separate species, but so analogous to each other,
that, if any one should happen to fail, the gap
in the genus would hardly be perceptible. It is
this great number of neighbouring species which
hath given to naturalists the idea of genera; an
idea which can only be employed when we view
objects in general, but which vanishes whenever
we consider nature in detail.</P>
<P>Men at first gave distinct names to objects which
appeared to differ from each other; and, at the
same time, they gave general denominations to
objects that seemed to be nearly similar. A∣mong
a rude people, and in the infancy of all lan∣guages,
there is hardly any thing but general
terms, or vague and ill-formed expressions for
objects of the same order, though very different
from each other. An oak, a beech, a linden-tree,
a fir, a pine, a yew, would, at first, have
no other name but that of <HI>a tree</HI>; afterwards the
oak, the beech, and the yew, would all be called
<HI>oak</HI>; when these were distinguished from the fir,
the pine, and the yew, the three latter would be
called <HI>fir.</HI> Particular names could only be in∣vented
in consequence of a minute examination
of each different species; and the numbers of
these names are augmented in proportion to the
extent of our knowledge of Nature: The more
<PB N="277" REF="341"/>
we examine her, proper and particular names
will become more frequent. When natural ob∣jects,
therefore, are represented to us, under ge∣neral
denominations, or by classes and genera, it
is recalling the darkness peculiar to the infant
state of human knowledge. Ignorance is the
parent of genera; but science will for ever con∣tinue
to create and to multiply proper names;
and I shall never hesitate in adding to their num∣ber,
as often as I have occasion to delineate dif∣ferent
species.</P>
<P>Several species of small animals have been
confounded under the generic name of <HI>Rat</HI>: But
we shall confine this name solely to the com∣mon
rat, which is of a blackish colour, and in∣fests
the habitations of men. The rat common∣ly
frequents granaries and barns, and from
thence, when food is scarce, comes into our
houses. He is a carnivorous, or rather an om∣nivorous
animal: He seems only to prefer hard
substances to those which are tender or succulent.
He gnaws linen, cloaths, furniture, makes holes
in the walls, lodges in the ceilings, and in the
void spaces between the wall and the wainscot∣ting.
From these lurking places the rats issue in
quest of food, and transport thither every sub∣stance
they can drag, forming considerable ma∣gazines,
especially when they have young to
provide for. The female brings forth several
times a year, but always in the summer season.
The litter generally consists of five or six. They
<PB N="278" REF="342"/>
are fond of warmth, and, in winter, insinuate
themselves near the chimneys, or lodge among
hay or straw: In spite of cats, poison, and snares,
these animals multiply so greatly, that they of∣ten
do much damage. In old country-houses
where grain is kept, and where the vicinity of
barns and magazines of hay facilitates their re∣treat,
they often increase so prodigiously, that
the possessors are obliged to remove and desert
their habitations, unless the rats happen to de∣stroy
each other. It is well known, that rats,
when pinched for food, eat one another. When
a famine is created by too great a number being
crouded into one place, the strong kill the weak,
open their heads, and first eat the brain, and then
the rest of the body. Next day, the war is re∣newed,
and continues in the same manner till
most of them are destroyed. This is the reason
why these animals, after being extremely trouble∣some,
disappear all of a sudden, and return not
for a long time. The same thing happens to
field-mice, whose prodigious multiplication is in∣terrupted
only by the hostilities they exercise on
each other, when provisions become scarce. This
sudden destruction is ascribed by Aristotle to the
operation of rains. But rats are not exposed to
rain, and the field-mice know how to guard
themselves against its effects; for the holes they
inhabit are not even moist.</P>
<P>The rats are as lascivious as they are voraci∣ous:
They squeak during their amours, and cry
<PB N="279" REF="343"/>
when they fight. They prepare a bed for their
young, and soon learn them to eat. When the
young begin to issue from their hole, the mo∣ther
watches, defends, and even fights with the
cats, in order to save them. A large rat is more
mischievous, and nearly as strong as a young
cat. The fore-teeth of the rat are long and
strong: The cat is not a good biter; and, as she
uses only her claws, she requires both to be vi∣gorous
and accustomed to fight. The weasel,
though smaller, is a more dangerous and formi∣dable
enemy, because he follows the rat into his
hole. Their strength being nearly equal, the
combat often continues long: But the method of
using their arms is very different. The rat wounds
only by reiterated strokes with his fore-teeth,
which are rather destined for gnawing than bi∣ting;
and, being situated at the extremity of the
lever, or jaw, they have not much force. But
the weasel bites cruelly with the whole jaw, and,
instead of letting go his hold, he sucks the blood
from the wounded part; and, therefore, the rat
uniformly falls a sacrifice to the weasel.</P>
<P>Of this species, as in all those which consist of
numerous individuals, there are many varieties.
Beside the common rat, which is blackish, some
are brown, others gray, reddish, and even totally
white. The white rats have red eyes, like the
white rabbit, the white mouse, and all the other a∣nimals
which are perfectly white. The whole spe∣cies,
and its varieties, appear to be natives of the
<PB N="280" REF="344"/>
temperate climates, and are more diffused over
the warm than the cold regions. There were no
rats originally in America<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>See la descript. des Antilles par le P. du Tertre, tom. 2. p. 303. L'hist. nat. des Antilles, p. 261. Nouveaux voyages aux iles de l'Amerique, tom. 3. p. 160. Dampier, tom. 4. p. 225.</P></NOTE>; but those imported
from Europe multiplied so prodigiously, that they
were long the scourge of the colonies, where they
had no enemies but large serpents, who swallow∣ed
them alive. They have been carried by ships
into the East Indies, and all the islands of the In∣dian
Archipelago<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lettres edifiantes, recueil 18. p. 161.</NOTE>; and are found likewise in
Africa<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Guinée par Bosman, p. 241. L'hist. gen. des voyages par M. l'Abbé Prevôt, tom. 4. p. 238.</NOTE>. But, towards the north, they have ne∣ver

<P>Pontoppidan remarks, 'that neither the wood
nor water rats can live farther north than Nor∣way;
that there are several districts, as that of
Hordenver in the diocese of Bergen, and others
in the diocese of Aggerhum, where no rats are
to be found; and that the rats on the south
banks of the river Vormen soon perish when
<PB N="281" REF="345"/>
carried to the north side of it. This difference,'
he adds, 'can only be ascribed to certain exhala∣tions
of the soil, which are destructive to these
animals.' These facts may be true: But we
have often discovered that Pontoppidan is an au∣thor
who deserves not entire credit.</P>
<P>M. le Vicomte de Querhoënt has favoured me
with the following remarks: That the rats, tran∣sported
from Europe to the Isle of France, increa∣sed
to such a degree, that, it is alledged, they
made the Dutch leave the island. The French
have diminished the number, though great quan∣tities
of them still remain. Some time, adds M.
de Querhoënt, after a rat resides in India, he ac∣quires
so strong a smell of musk, that he scents
every thing for a considerable space round his ha∣bitation;
and it is alledged, that, when he comes
near wine, he makes it turn sour.—This Indian
rat appears to be the same which the Portuguese
call <HI>Cheroso,</HI> or odoriferous rat. La Boullaye-le-Gouz
says, 'that it is very small, and nearly of
the figure of a ferret; that its ite is venom∣ous;
that its smell is immediately perceived
when it enters a chamber; and that it cries

<P>THE Mouse is much smaller, equally nume∣rous,
and more generally diffused than the
rat. It has the same instinct, the same constitu∣tion
and natural dispositions, and differs only by
its weakness, and the habits which result from this
circumstance. Timid by nature, and familiar
from necessity, fear and want are the sources of
all its movements. He never issues from his hole
but in quest of food, and runs in again upon the
least alarm. He goes not, like the rat, from
house to house, unless he be forced, and is not
near so destructive. His manners are gentle, and
he may be tamed to a certain degree; but he ne∣ver
<PB N="283" REF="347"/>
discovers the smallest attachment to his bene∣factors.
It is not, indeed, easy to love those who
are perpetually laying snares for us. Though
weak, the mouse has many enemies, from whom
he has no means of escape, but those of agility
and minuteness. Owls, birds of prey, cats, wea∣sels,
and even rats, make war upon the mice.
They are shot, caught in traps, and destroyed
by millions. In a word, they subsist by their a∣mazing
fecundity alone.</P>
<P>They bring forth at all seasons, and several
times in the year. The litter generally consists
of five or six. In less than fifteen days, the
young are strong enough to disperse, and to pro∣cure
food for themselves. The duration of life
in those small animals must, therefore, be short,
since their growth is so rapid; and this circum∣stance
still farther augments the idea of their pro∣digious
multiplication. Aristotle tells us, that,
having shut up a pregnant mouse in a vessel, a∣long
with plenty of grain, he, in a short time af∣ter,
found 120 mice, all sprung from the same
mother.</P>
<P>These little animals are by no means ugly;
they have a vivacious and elegant air. That spe∣cies
of horror some people feel at them, arises
from the surprise and inconveniencies they some∣times
occasion. All mice are whitish under the
belly, and some are altogether white. Others are
more or less brown and black. The species is
generally diffused over Europe, Asia, and Africa;
<PB N="284" REF="348"/>
and, it is alledged, that those of America, where
they are very numerous, came originally from the
Old Continent. It is, however, certain, that this
little animal follows man, and flies from uninha∣bited
places, probably on account of its natural
appetite for bread, cheese, butter, oil, and other
aliment which men prepare for themselves.</P>

<P>White mice, with red eyes, are found not only
in our temperate climates, but in the southern
and northern regions of both Continents. 'White
mice, with red eyes,' says Pontoppidan, 'have
been found in the small village of Rams-dal∣lem;
but, whether they are indigenous, or
brought from the East-Indies, is uncertain.' This
last supposition seems to have no foundation;
for, it is natural to expect white mice in Nor∣way,
as well as every where else in Europe;
and mice, in general, are equally numerous in
America as in the Old Continent.'</P>

<P>THIS animal is less than the rat, and larger
than the mouse. It never lives in houses,
but is found in the fields and woods. Its eyes are
remarkably large and prominent; and it differs
still more from the rat and mouse, by the colour
of its hair, which is whitish under the belly, and
of a reddish brown on the back. It is very gene∣rally
and copiously diffused, especially in elevated
countries. It seems to take a considerable time in
arriving at full growth, because it varies greatly
in size. The largest are between four and five
inches long; and the smaller ones, which appear
likewise to be adults, are an inch shorter. And,
as we find them of all intermediate sizes, both the
<PB N="286" REF="350"/>
great and small are unquestionably the same spe∣cies.
Ignorance of this fact has, probably, led
some naturalists to make two species of them, the
one called <HI>the great field-rat,</HI> and the other <HI>the
field-mouse.</HI> Ray, who first fell into this blunder,
seems to acknowledge that he knew but one
species<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De hac specie mihi non undequaque satisfactum est; <HI>Ray, synops. quad. p.</HI> 219.</NOTE>. And, though the short descriptions he
has given each species appear to differ, we ought not
to conclude that both exist: 1. Because he him∣self
knew but one; 2. Because, after all the re∣searches
I have made, I have not been able to dis∣cover
more than one kind; because Gesner, and
other naturalists, mention only one species, under
the name of <HI>mus agrestis major,</HI> which they say
is very common; and because Ray says that the
other kind, called <HI>mus domesticus medius,</HI> is also
very common: Hence, it is apparent, that none
of these authors have ever seen both kinds, since
they acknowledge both to be very common; 4.
Because, in this single species, individuals are
found of a larger and lesser size, this circumstance
might lead them to consider the small as of one
species, and the large of another; Lastly, because
the descriptions are too vague and inaccurate to
establish a specific difference.</P>
<P>The antients, indeed, mention two species, the
one under the denomination of <HI>mus agrestis ma∣jor,</HI>
the other under that of <HI>mus agrestis minor.</HI>
These two species are very common, and we know
<PB N="287" REF="351"/>
them as well as the antients: The first is our long∣tailed
field-mouse; the second is not the <HI>mus do∣mesticus
medius</HI> of Ray, but another animal,
known by the name of the <HI>short-tailed field-mouse,</HI>
or <HI>little field-rat.</HI> And, as it differs both from
the rat and the long-tailed field-mouse, I have
given it its Italian name, <HI>compagnoli</HI> or <HI>compag∣nol.</HI></P>
<P>The long-tailed field-mouse, as I formerly re∣maked,
lives in dry and elevated grounds. In
the woods and adjacent fields, they are found in
vast numbers. They retire into holes among the
brushwood and under the trunks of trees, where
they amass great quantities of acorns, nuts, and
beech-mast; sometimes a whole bushel is found
in a single hole; and this hoard is not propor∣tioned
to the wants of the animal, but to the ca∣pacity
of the place where it is deposited. These
holes are generally more than a foot under ground,
and often divided into two apartments, the one
for living in along with their young, and the o∣ther
for a magazine. I have frequently seen great
damage done to the plantations by these animals.
They carry off the new sown acorns; by follow∣ing
the furrow of the plough, they dig up one
after another, not leaving a sngle seed. This
happens chiefly in those seasons when the acorns
are scarce: Not finding enough in the woods,
they come in quest of them in the cultivated fields,
and do not eat them on the spot, but transport
them to their holes, where they amass such quan∣tities,
<PB N="288" REF="352"/>
tities, that they often corrupt. These creatures
alone do more mischief in a nursery of trees than
all the birds and other animals put together. The
only way to prevent this damage is, to lay traps at
ten paces asunder through the extent of the sown
ground. No other apparatus is necessary than a
roasted walnut placed under a flat stone, support∣ed
by a stick. The animals come to eat the wal∣nut,
which they prefer to acorns; and, as the
walnut is fixed to the stick, whenever they touch
it, the stone falls and crushes them to death. I
have used the same expedient for the destruction
of the short-tailed field-mouse, who likewise de∣stroy
acorns. When I began this operation, I
desired all the mice that were caught by the traps
to be brought to me, and found, with astonish∣ment,
that above 100 were taken each day, from
a piece of ground consisting only of about 40
French arpents. From the 15th of November to
the 8th of December, above 2000 were slain in
this manner. Their numbers gradually decreased
till the frost became severe, when they retire to
their holes, and feed upon the magazines they
have collected. It is more than 20 years since I
made this trial, which I always repeated when I
sowed tree-seeds, and never failed to catch vast
quantities of these mice. They abound chiefly
in autumn, their numbers being much less in the
spring: For, if provisions fail during the winter,
the strong devour the weak. The long-tailed
field mice likewise eat the short-tailed species, and
<PB N="289" REF="353"/>
even thrushes, blackbirds, and other birds which
they find entangled in snares. They first eat the
brain, and then the rest of the body. I once
kept a dozen of these mice in a cage, and furnish∣ed
them with food every morning at eight o'clock.
One day they were neglected for about a quar∣ter
of an hour, when one of their number was
eaten up by the rest; next day another fuffered
the same fate; and, in a few days, only one re∣mained:
All the others had been killed, and part∣ly
devoured; and even the survivor himself had
his feet and tail mutilated.</P>
<P>The rat is very prolific; but the long-tailed
field-mouse is more so. The latter brings forth
more than once a year, and the litters often con∣sist
of nine or ten, while those of the rat never
exceed five or six. In one hole I have found two
mothers and twenty young. This animal is very
generally diffused over Europe. It is found in
Sweden, and is called by Linnaeus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Faun. Suec. p. 11.</NOTE> <HI>mus cauda

<P>THIS animal is about the size of a rat; but,
from its manners and dispositions, has a
much greater resemblance to the otter than to
the common rat. Like the otter, it frequents
the fresh water, and is found on the margins of
rivers, brooks, and pools, and lives mostly on
fishes. Gudgeons, minnows, blays, and the fry
of carps, pikes, and barbels, are its ordinary food.
<PB N="291" REF="355"/>
He likewise eats frogs, water-insects, and some∣times
the roots of plants. He has not, like the
otter, membranes between his toes. This error
has been copied from Willoughby by Ray and
other naturalists. Though all his toes be se∣parate,
he swims with ease, keeps long under
the water, and carries off his prey to be devour∣ed
upon the grass, or in his hole. He is some∣times
surprised by fishers when searching for
craw-fish; and he endeavours to escape by biting
their fingers, or leaping into the water. His
head is shorter, his muzzle thicker, his hair more
bushy, and his tail much shorter, than those of
the rat. Like the otter, he avoids large rivers,
or rather those which are much frequented. He
never visits houses or barns, but keeps upon the
margins of waters, from which he wanders not
upon dry land so far as the otter, who is some∣times
found at the distance of a league from wa∣ter.
Water-rats are seldom met with in elevated
places, or in dry plains, but are extremely nu∣merous
in moist and marshy vallies. The fe∣males
come in season about the end of winter,
and bring forth in the month of April, the litter
generally consisting of six or seven. Perhaps
they bring forth more than once a year; but of
this we have no proper knowledge. Their flesh
is not intollerably bad, being eaten by the pea∣sants,
as well as the otter, during the season of
lent. They are found every where over Europe,
<PB N="292" REF="356"/>
excepting in the polar regions. If we may cre∣dit
Bellon, they inhabit the banks of the Nile:
However, the figure he gives of them has so lit∣tle
resemblance to our water-rat, that it is proba∣ble
the Nile rats form a different species of ani∣mals.</P>

<P>THE Short-tailed Field-mouse is still more
common and more generally diffused than
the long-tailed kind. The latter never appears
in high grounds; but the former is found every
where, in the woods, the fields, the meadows,
and even in the gardens. It is remarkable for
the thickness of its head, and the shortness of its
tail, which exceeds not an inch in length. It
digs holes in the earth, where it amasses grain,
filberts, and acorns: But it appears to prefer corn
to every other food. In the month of July,
when the grain is ripe, the short-tailed field-mice
assemble from all quarters, and often do great da∣mage
<PB N="294" REF="360"/>
by cutting the stalks of the corn, in order
to come at the ears. They follow the reapers,
and eat up all the fallen or neglected grain.
When the gleanings are devoured, they flock
to the new-sown fields, and prematurely de∣stroy
the crop of the ensuing year. In winter,
most of them retire into the woods, where they
feed upon filberts, acorns, and the seeds of trees.
In particular years, they appear in numbers so
immense, that they would destroy every thing,
if they continued long: But they always kill and
eat one another during a scarcity of provisions.
They, besides, become the prey of the long-tailed
field-mouse, the fox, the wild cat, and the wea∣sels.</P>
<P>In its internal structure, this animal resembles
the water-rat more than any other; but differs
from him externally by several essential charac∣ters:
1. By the size; the short-tailed field mouse
is not above three inches long; but the water∣rat
is seven inches: 2. By the dimensions of the
head and body, those of the former being pro∣portionally
thicker than those of the latter: 3. By
the length of the tail, which, in this field-mouse,
exceeds not a third of the length of the animal's
body; but the length of the tail of the water-rat
is near two thirds of its body: Lastly, By its
manners and dispositions: It feeds not upon fish∣es,
nor goes into water, but nourishes itself with
acorns, corn, and tuberous roots, such as those of
the dandelion, &amp;c. Their holes resemble those

<P>THIS little animal, though a native of Bra∣sil
and of Guiney, lives and propagates in
the temperate, and even in the cold climates,
when protected from the inclemency of the sea∣sons.
Though they multiply prodigiously in
France, their numbers are never great; because
the care they require is not compensated by the
profits arising from them. Their skin is hardly
of any value, and their flesh, though eatable, is
<PB N="297" REF="364"/>
not so good as to be much demanded; but, it
might be improved, by keeping them in warrens,
where they would have the benefit of fresh air,
and the liberty of choosing herbs agreeable to
their taste. Those kept in houses have nearly
the same bad taste with warren-rabbits; and
those kept in gardens during summer, have an
insipid, but less disagreeable savour.</P>
<P>The temperament of these animals is so hot
and premature, that they copulate five or six
weeks after their birth. They acquire not, how∣ever,
their full growth before the 8th or 9th
month. But this increase of size consists only of
fat; for the solid parts are fully unfolded before the
age of six months. The females go with young
only three weeks; and I have known them bring
forth at the age of two months. The first litter
consists of four or five; the second of five or six;
and the succeeding ones of seven or eight, and
sometimes of ten or twelve. The mother suckles
her young twelve or fifteen days; she banishes
them as soon as she receives the male, which
happens, at farthest, three weeks after her deli∣very;
and, if any of them persist in following
her, they are maletreated and slain by the father.
Thus these animals produce at least every two
months; and, as their young bring forth in the
same space, we are astonished at their rapid and
numerous multiplication. From a single couple
we may have 1000 in one year. But their
destruction is as rapid as their propagation. They
<PB N="230" REF="365"/>
are killed by cold and by moisture; they allow
themselves, without resistance, to be eaten by the
cats; even the mothers defend not their young
from their destroyers; not having time to form
an attachment to their young, they make no ef∣forts
to save them. The males are still less solli∣citous
about their offspring, and even allow them∣selves
to be devoured, without resistance. They
seem to have no distinct sentiment, but that of
love. When under the influence of this passion,
they are susceptible of anger, fight cruelly, and e∣ven
kill each other in disputing the possession of
a female. They pass their lives in sleeping, eat∣ing,
and amours. Their sleep is short, but fre∣quent;
they eat every hour, both day and night;
and they indulge in mutual embraces as often as
they eat. Though perpetually throwing out
urine, they never drink. They feed on all kinds
of herbs, but especially on parsley, which they
prefer to grain or to bread. They are likewise
fond of apples and other fruits. They eat preci∣pitantly,
like the rabbit, little at a time, but very
often. They make a kind of grunting noise, si∣milar
to that of a young pig. A kind of chirp∣ing
noise marks the time of their amours, and
they raise a sharp cry when they feel pain. They
are extremely delicate, and so impatient of cold,
that it is difficult to preserve them through the
winter. They must be kept in a dry, warm,
wholesome place. When they feel cold, they as∣semble
and crowd close together; and they often

all perish in this situation. By nature they are
gentle and tame. They do no mischief; but
they are equally incapable of good; for they ne∣ver
form any attachments. Mild by constitution,
docile through weakness, almost insensible to e∣very
object, they have the appearance of living
machines constructed for the purposes of propa∣gation,
and of representing a species.</P>

<P><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> 'That the fox
knows many things, and the hedge-hog but
one important thing,' is a proverbial saying
of the antients<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Zenodotus, Plutarchus, et alii ex Archilocho.</NOTE>. The latter knows how to de∣fend
himself without fighting, and to wound
without making an attack. Having little strength,
and less agility for flight, he has received from
<PB N="301" REF="369"/>
Nature a spinous armour, with the faculty of rol∣ling
himself up like a ball, and of presenting on
all sides those sharp weapons, which repel the e∣nemy.
The more he is harassed, he rolls him∣self
up the closer. His fears tend still farther to
defend him; for, by throwing out his urine, the
smell and humidity of which spreads over his
whole body, he completely disgusts the enemy.
Thus most dogs content themselves with barking,
and never choose to seize the hedge-hog. The
fox, however, accomplishes his end, by wounding
the animal's feet, and making the blood run into
its mouth. But the hedge-hog is proof against the
weasel, the martin, the polecat, the ferret, and birds
of prey. From the head to the tail, both male
and female are equally covered with spines, and
only the under parts of their bodies are garnish∣ed
with hair. But those arms, which are so useful
to them in defending against enemies, become
exceeding inconvenient when they want to u∣nite.
They cannot copulate in the manner of
other quadrupeds, but face to face, either on end,
or lying. The females come in season in the
spring, and bring forth in the beginning of sum∣mer.
I have frequently had the mother and her
young brought to me in the month of June. The
litter generally consists of three or four, and some∣times
of five. When very young, they are white,
and the buds of the spines are only visible through
the skin. I tried to rear some of them, by put∣ting
the mother and her young in a barrel, with,
<PB N="302" REF="370"/>
plenty of provisions: But, in place of suckling,
she devoured them one after another. This was
not the effect of hunger; for she eat bread, meat,
and fruits. One would never have imagined that
an animal so slow and indolent, could be so im∣patient
of confinement. It even possesses the
same species of malevolence with that of the mon∣key.
A hedge-hog that had slipped into the
kitchen, took the meat out of a small kettle, and
defiled it with his ordure. I kept males and fe∣males
in a room together; but, though they li∣ved,
they never coupled. I left several of them
in my gardens, where they did so little mischief,
that it could hardly be perceived. They live up∣on
fallen fruits; and dig the earth to a small
depth with their noses. They eat may-bugs,
beetles, grashoppers, worms, and some roots.
They are likewise fond of flesh-meat, which they
devour either raw or roasted. In the country,
they are frequently found in the woods, under
the trunks of old trees, in the cliffs of rocks, and
particularly among the stones collected upon the
fields and vineyards. I am uncertain whether
they climb trees, as some naturalists assert<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Arbores ascendit, poma et pyra decutit, in istis sese volu∣tat ut spinis haereant; <HI>Sperling. Zoologia,</HI> p. 281.</P></NOTE>, or
use their spines for transporting fruits or grapes.
They seize with the mouth every thing they eat;
and, though they abound in our forests, they
have never been discovered upon trees, but are
always found in holes or under the moss. They
<PB N="303" REF="371"/>
stir not during the day, but go about the whole
night. They approach not the habitations of
men; but, though they sometimes appear in the
meadows, they prefer dry and elevated grounds.
They are taken by the hand, never fly, nor de∣fend
themselves with their feet or their teeth;
but, when touched, they roll up in the form of a
ball, and will not extend themselves, unless they
be plunged in water. They sleep during the
winter; and, therefore, the provisions they are
said to amass in summer, would be entirely use∣less
to them. They eat little, and can live long
without food. Their blood is nearly as cold as
that of those animals who sleep during winter.
Their flesh makes not good eating; and their
skin, of which no use is now made, was former∣ly
employed for heckling hemp.</P>
<P>Some authors mention two species of hedge∣hog,
one with a snout like a hog, and the o∣ther
with a muzzle resembling that of a dog. But
I know only one species, of which there are even
no varieties in our climates. The hedge-hogs are
very generally diffused: They are found every

<P>THE Shrew Mouse seems to form a link in
the chain of small animals, and to fill the
interval between the rat and the mole, which,
though they resemble each other in size, differ
greatly in figure, and are very distant species.
The shrew is still smaller than the mouse, and has
<PB N="306" REF="375"/>
an affinity to the mole, by its long nose; by its
eyes, which, though larger than those of the
mole, are much concealed, and more minute than
those of the mouse; by the number of its toes,
having five on each foot; by the tail and legs, e∣specially
the hind-legs, which are shorter than
those of the mouse; by the ears; and, lastly, by
the teeth. This little animal has a strong and
peculiar odour, which is very disagreeable to the
cats, who pursue and kill, but never eat the shrews.
It is probably this bad smell, and the reluctance
of the cats, which have given rise to the vulgar
prejudice, that the bite of the shrew-mouse is ve∣nomous,
and particulary hurtful to horses. But
the shrew is neither venomous, nor is it capable
of biting; for the aperture of its mouth is not
large enough to take in a duplicature of another
animal's skin, which is absolutely necessary to the
action of biting. The disease of horses, vulgarly
ascribed to the bite of the shrew-mouse, is a swel∣ling
or blotch, and proceeds from an internal cause,
which has no relation to a bite. This animal,
especially in winter, frequents hay-lofts, stables,
barns, and dung-hills. It feeds upon grain, in∣sects,
and putrid flesh. In the country, it fre∣quents
the woods, and lives upon grain. It con∣ceals
itself under moss and the leaves and trunks
of trees, and sometimes in the holes abandoned
by the mole, or in smaller holes which it digs
with its muzzle and claws. The shrew produ∣ces
an equal number, though not so frequently,
<PB N="307" REF="376"/>
as the mouse. Its cry is also much sharper; but
it is not near so agile. It is easily taken;
because it both sees and runs badly. The colour
of the shrew is a mixture of brown and red; but
some are ash-coloured, and others nearly black,
though all of them are white under the belly.
They are very common in Europe; but they seem
not to exist in America. The Brasilian animal
mentioned by Marcgrave<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Marcgravii hist. Brasil. p. 229.</NOTE>, under the name of
the shrew mouse, which, he says, has two black
lists on the back, is larger, and seems to be a dif∣ferent

<P>THE Mole, though not blind, has eyes so
small, and so covered, that it can have little
benefit from the sense of seeing. In recompense,
Nature has bestowed on it a profuse portion of the
<PB N="310" REF="380"/>
sixth sense, remarkable vessels and reservoirs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Testes maximos, parastatas amplissimas, novum corpus semi∣nale ab his diversum ac separatum—penem etiam facile om∣num. ni fallor, animalium longissimum; ex quibus coligere est, maximam prae reliquis omnibus animalibus voluptatem in coitu, hoc abjectum et vile animalculum percipere, ut habeant quod ipsi invidiant qui in hoc supremas vitae suae delicias col∣locant; <HI>Ray, Synops. animal. quad. p.</HI> 239.</NOTE>, a
prodigious quantity of seminal fluid, enormous
testicles, a penis of immoderate length; and
all these parts are concealed within the body,
which must render them more hot and ac∣tive.
Of all animals the mole is most amply en∣dowed
with generative organs, and consequent∣ly
with their relative sensations. It has, besides,
a delicate sense of touch; a skin as soft as vel∣vet;
a very fine ear, and small hands, with five
fingers, very different from the extremities of o∣ther
quadrupeds, and nearly similar to the hu∣man
hand; great strength in proportion to the
size of its body; a compact skin; and a perpetual
vigour. So lively and reciprocal an attachment
subsists between the male and female, that they
seem to dread or to disrelish all other society.
They enjoy the placid habits of repose and of
solitude, the art of securing themselves from dis∣quiet
and injury, of instantaneously making an
asylum or habitation, of extending its dimensions,
and of finding a plentiful subsistence, without the
necessity of going abroad. These are the man∣ners,
the dispositions, and the talents of the mole;
and they are unquestionably preferable to talents
<PB N="311" REF="381"/>
more brilliant and more incompatible with hap∣piness,
than the most profound obscurity.</P>
<P>The mole shuts up the entrance of her retreat,
and seldom leaves it, unless compelled by the ad∣mission
of water, or when its mansion is demo∣lished
by art. She makes a round vault in the
meadows, and generally a long trench in the gar∣dens;
because it is easier to remove cultivated
ground, than a turf rendered compact and solid
by the roots of herbs. She continues not long
in miry nor in hard stony ground, but delights in
a soft earth, stored with esculent roots, and well
peopled with insects and worms, which constitute
her chief nourishment.</P>
<P>As the moles seldom leave their subterranean
abodes, they have few enemies, and easily elude
the carnivorous animals. The overflowing of
rivers is their greatest scourge: During inunda∣tions,
they are seen swimming in vast numbers, and
using every effort to gain the more elevated
grounds; but most of them perish, as well as
their young, who remain in their holes. With∣out
this devastation, the great talents they have
for multiplying would render them extremely
incommodious to man. They couple about the
end of winter, and go but a short time with young;
for we find them very small in the month of May.
They generally bring forth four or five at a time;
and it is easy to distinguish the hillocks under which
they litter; for they are larger, and made with
more art than the common kind. I believe those
<PB N="312" REF="382"/>
animals bring forth more than once a year; but
of this I cannot be certain: It is a fact, however,
that we meet with young ones from April to Au∣gust.
Perhaps some of them may be later in
coupling than others.</P>
<P>The habitation where they deposit their young
merits a particular description; because it is con∣structed
with singular intelligence. They begin
with raising the earth, and forming a pretty high
arch. They leave partitions, or a kind of pillars
at certain distances, beat and press the earth, in∣terweave
it with the roots of plants, and render
it so hard and solid, that the water cannot pene∣trate
the vault, on account of its convexity and
firmness. They then elevate a little hillock below,
upon the top of which they lay herbs and leaves,
for a bed to their young. In this situation, they
are above the level of the ground, and conse∣quently
out of the reach of ordinary inundations,
and are, at the same time, defended from the rains
by the large vault that covers the internal one,
upon the convexity of which they rest, along with
their young. This internal hillock, or vault, is
pierced on all sides with sloping holes, which de∣scend
still lower, and serve as subterraneous pas∣sages
for the mother to go in quest of food
for herself and her offspring. These by-paths
are firm and beaten, extend about twelve or fif∣teen
paces, and issue from the mansion like rays
from a centre. We likewise find, under the superior
vault, the remains of the roots of the <HI>colchicum,</HI> or
<PB N="313" REF="383"/>
meadow saffron, which seem to be the first food
given to the young. From this description it is
apparent, that the mole never comes out but at a
considerable distance from her habitation, and
that the most simple and most certain method of
taking both the old and the young, is to make a
round trench, which will cut off all the commu∣nicating
passages. But, as the mole, upon the
smallest noise, flies, and endeavours to carry off
her young, it will be necessary to employ three
or four men with spades to raise the hillock at
once, or to make a trench almost instantaneously,
and then to seize them, or to watch them as they
attempt to escape.</P>
<P>It has been foolishly asserted by some writers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ursus, <HI>Meles,</HI> Erinaceus, <HI>Talpa,</HI> Vespertilio per hyemem dormiunt abstemii; <HI>Linn. Faun. Suec. p.</HI> 8.</NOTE>,
that the mole and badger sleep during the whole
winter, without taking any food. The badger,
as we formerly remarked<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Article Badger.</NOTE>, comes out of his hole
in winter, as well as in summer, in quest of pro∣visions;
and it is easy to be ascertained of this fact,
by the tracks he leaves upon the snow. The mole
sleeps so little in winter, that she raises the earth
in the same manner as she does in summer; and
the country people remark, that <HI>a thaw approaches,
because the moles make hills.</HI> They are, indeed,
fond of warm places; and they are often caught
by the gardeners in the months of December,
January, and February.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="384"/>
The mole frequents cultivated countries only.
There are none in the dry deserts, nor in the cold
climates, where the earth is frozen during the
greatest part of the year. The animal called the
Siberian mole<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Albert Seba, vol. 1. p. 5.</NOTE>, with green and yellow hair, is
a different species from our mole, which abounds
only from Sweden<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Linn. Faun. Suec. p. 7.</NOTE> to Barbary<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Shaw's travels.</NOTE>; for, from the
silence of travellers, it is presumeable, that they
exist not in hot climates. Those of America are
likewise different: The Virginian mole<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Albert Seba, vol. 1. p. 5.</NOTE>, how∣ever,
has a great resemblance to ours, excepting
in the colour of the hair, which is mixed with
a deep purple. But the red mole of America is
a different animal<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Id. ibid.</NOTE>. There are only two or three
varieties in our common moles; we find them
more or less brown or black; and we have seen
them entirely white. Seba describes and gives
a figure of a black and white mole, which was

than our mole<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">This mole was found on the high-way.

<HEAD>The MOLE of the Cape of Good Hope.</HEAD>
<P>I have here given a figure of a mole found at
the Cape of Good Hope, a stuffed skin of
which was sent me by M. Sonnerat. This mole
pretty much resembles the common species in the
form of its body, in the eyes, in the ears, and in
the tail; but it differs in the head, which is lar∣ger,
and in the muzzle, which resembles that of a
Guiney-pig. The fore-feet are likewise different:
The hair is not black, but dark brown, with a
little yellow at the extremity of each hair. The
tail is covered with large hairs of a yellowish
white colour; and, in general, the hair of this
mole is longer than that of the European. From
all these descriptions we may conclude, that it is
a particular species, and that, though allied to the
common mole, it cannot be regarded as a simple
variety.</P>

<HEAD>The PENSYLVANIA MOLE.</HEAD>
<P>IN Pensylvania, says M. Kalm, there is a spe∣cies
of mole, which lives principally on roots.
This animal digs, in the fields, small winding sub∣terraneous
alleys. In proportion to its size, it
has more strength and rigidity in its paws than
most other quadrupeds. In digging the earth, it
uses its feet like oars. M. Kalm put one of them
into his handkerchief; and he found, that, in
less than a minute, it had made a number of small
holes, as if the cloth had been pierced with a bod∣kin.
It was very mischievous; and, whenever
it found any objects in its way, it immediately
perforated them with its teeth. I presented to it,
continues M. Kalm, my ink-piece, which was
made of steel; it began to bite the ink-piece; but
was soon repelled by the hardness of the metal,
and never afterwards inclined to bite any thing
that was held out to it. This animal raises not
the earth, like the moles of Europe, but only
makes small paths under the ground<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Kalm, tom. 2. p. 333.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>These characters are not sufficient to give us a
proper knowledge of the animal, nor enable us to
decide whether it belongs to the mole-tribe.</P>

<P>THOUGH all beings are equally perfect
in themselves, since they proceed from the
hands of the same Creator; yet, in relation to
man, some beings are more accomplished, and o∣thers
seem to be imperfect or deformed. Of the
former kind are all those whose figures appear to
us to be agreeable and complete; because all their
parts and members are proportioned, all their
movements and functions easy and natural. The
latter kind of beings, which to us have a hideous
aspect, comprehends all those whose qualities are
noxious to man, whose nature is uncommon, and
whose form differs from the ordinary figures from
<PB N="318" REF="390"/>
which we received our primary sensations, and
derived those ideas which serve as models to our
judgment. The head of a man upon the neck
of a horse, and its body covered with feathers,
and terminating in the tail of a fish, represents a
picture of enormous deformity, for no other rea∣son
but because it unites what Nature has placed
at the greatest distance. An animal, like the bat,
which is half a quadruped and half a bird, and
which, upon the whole, is neither the one nor
the other, must be a monstrous being; because,
by uniting the attributes of two opposite genera,
it resembles none of those models presented to us
in the great classes of nature. It is an imperfect
quadruped, and a still more imperfect bird. A
quadruped should have four feet, and a bat should
have feathers and wings. In the bat, the fore∣feet,
though they serve the animal for the double
purpose of flying and of trailing its body on the
ground, are neither wings nor feet. They are
deformed extremities, the bones of which are e∣normously
lengthened, and united by a mem∣brane,
which is neither covered with feathers nor
with hair. They are a species of pinions, or
winged paws, in which we see only a claw of
an inch in length; and the other four long toes
must act along with the former; for they have
no proper movements or separate functions.
They are a kind of hands ten times larger than
the feet, and four times longer than the body of
the animal. In fine, they are parts which have
<PB N="319" REF="391"/>
rather the air of caprice than of a regular pro∣duction.
This membrane covers the arm, forms
the wings or hands of the animal, unites with the
skin of the body, and, at the same time, surrounds
the legs, and even the tail, which, by this bizarre
conjunction, becomes, in some measure, one of
its toes. To these discrepancies and dispropor∣tions
of the body and its members may be added
the deformities of the head, which are often much
greater: For, in some species, the nose is hardly
visible, the eyes are sunk near the ear, and con∣founded
with the cheeks: In others, the ears are
as long as the body, or the face is twisted into the
form of a horse-shoe, and the nose turned up like
a cock's comb. All of them have small, obscure,
covered eyes, a nose, or rather nostrils, ill∣formed,
and a mouth extending from ear to ear:
They all likewise endeavour to conceal themselves,
fly the light, inhabit dark places only, from
which they never go out but during the night,
return at break of day, and fasten themselves
against the walls. Their motion in the air is ra∣ther
a desultory fluttering, than flying, which
they execute very aukwardly. With difficulty
they raise themselves from the earth, and never
fly to any great height: They quicken, relax,
or direct their flight, in a manner the most bung∣ling
and imperfect. Their flight is neither rapid
nor direct, but consists of quick vibrations, in an
oblique and winding direction. They fail not,
however, in passing, to seize flies, gnats, and par∣ticularly
<PB N="320" REF="392"/>
moths, which fly only during the night.
These they swallow almost entire; and we find,
in their excrements, portions of wings and other
dry and indigestible parts of moths. Having one
day descended into the caverns of Arcy, to exa∣mine
the stalactites, I was surprised to find, in a
place covered with alabaster, and so dark and pro∣found,
a kind of earth which was totally differ∣ent:
It was a thick mass, several feet in extent,
of a blackish matter, almost entirely composed of
fragments of the wings and legs of flies and
moths, as if immense numbers of these insects
had assembled in order to die and corrupt toge∣ther.
This, however, was nothing else but the
dung of bats, probably amassed during many
years in a favourite part of these subterranean
caverns; for, through the whole of these caverns,
which extend above half a quarter of a league, I
saw no other collection of this matter; and I i∣magined
that the bats had fixed upon this place
for their common abode; because it was reached
by a glimmering light from an aperture in the
rock, and that they chose not to go farther, lest
they should be lost in a darkness too profound.</P>
<P>Bats are real quadrupeds: Excepting the fa∣culty
of flying, they have nothing in common
with birds. But, as the action of flying implies
great strength in the upper and anterior parts of
the body, the bats have their pectoral muscles
much stronger and more fleshy than those of
quadrupeds; and in this they have an affinity to
<PB N="321" REF="393"/>
the birds. They differ from them, however, in
every other part of their structure, both external
and internal: The lungs, the heart, the organs of
generation, and all the other viscera, are similar to
those of quadrupeds, excepting the penis, which
is pendulous and loose, a thing peculiar to man,
the monkeys, and the bats. Like the quadru∣peds,
the bats are viviparous, and have teeth and
paps. They are said to bring forth but two at a
time, and that they suckle their young, and even
carry them when flying. In summer they copu∣late
and bring forth; for they are in a torpid
state during winter. Some cover themselves with
their wings, as with a mantle, and suspend them∣selves
by the hind feet to the vaults of subterrane∣ous
caverns; others stick fast to old walls, or re∣tire
into holes. Wherever they take up their
winter abode, they always assemble in such num∣bers
as secure them against the effects of cold.
They pass the winter without food or motion,
never awake till the spring, and again retire at
the end of autumn. They support hunger bet∣ter
than cold: Though carnivorous animals, they
can subsist several days without food. When
they get into a lardner, they fix upon the suspend∣ed
meat, and eat flesh whether raw or roasted,
fresh or corrupted.</P>
<P>Only two species of bats have formerly been
described as natives of our climate. Beside these,
M. Daubenton has discovered other six, which
are equally numerous and common; and it is
<PB N="322" REF="394"/>
therefore astonishing that they should so long
have escaped notice. These seven species are
perfectly distinct, and never associate together.</P>
<P>The first, which is well known, is the common
bat, of which we have already given the syno∣nimes.</P>
<P>The second, or long-eared<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Bat with ears an inch long, thin, and almost pellucid; the body and tail are only one inch and three quarters long. This and all other bats, except the <HI>Ternates</HI> and the <HI>horse-shoe,</HI> have a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or internal year, serving as a valve to close the greater when the animal is asleep; <HI>Pennant's synops. of quad.</HI> p. 371.</P>
<P>Vespertilio auritus, naso oreque simplici, auriculis duplica∣tis, capite majoribus; <HI>Linn. Syst.</HI> p. 47.</P></NOTE>, is likewise known
to the naturalists, and is perhaps still more nu∣merous
than the common bat. The long-eared
bat is much less than the common species; its
wings are likewise shorter, its muzzle smaller
and sharper, and its ears of an immoderate size.</P>
<P>The third species, which we shall denominate
the <HI>Noctule,</HI> from the Italian word <HI>notula,</HI> was
not known, though very common in France,
and even more frequent than the two preceding
species. This bat is found under the eaves of
houses, castles, and churches, and also in the hol∣lows
of old trees. It is nearly as large as the
common bat. Its ears are broad and short, its
hair reddish, and it has a sharp piercing voice,
like the sound of a small bell<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The noctule has the nose slightly bilobated; ears small and rounded; on the chin a minute verruca; hair of a red∣dish ash-colour; length to the rump two inches eight tenths; tail one inch seven tenths; extent of the wings 13 inches; <HI>Pennant's synops. of quad.</HI> p. 369.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="395"/>
The fourth species we shall call the <HI>Serotine.</HI>
It is smaller than the common bat or noctule, and
nearly of an equal size with the long-eared bat.
But it differs from the latter in having short,
pointed ears, blacker wings, and the hair of a
deeper brown.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The serotine has a longish nose, and short ears, but broad at the base: The hair on the upper part of the body is brown mixed with ferruginous, and the belly of a paler colour. The length from nose to rump is two inches and a half; <HI>Pennant's synops. of quad.</HI> p. 370.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The fifth species we shall name <HI>Pipistrelle,</HI>
from the Italian word <HI>pipistrello,</HI> which likewise
signifies a bat. The pipistrelle is not near so large
as the common bat, the serotine, the noctule, ore∣ven
the long-eared kind. It is the smallest, and
least ugly of all the bats, though the upper lip is
turgid, the eyes small and deep sunk, and the
front much covered with hair<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The pipistrelle has a small nose; the upper lip swells out a little on each side; the ears are broad, and the forehead covered with long hair: The colour of the upper part of the body is a yellowish brown, that of the lower part dusky, and the lips are yellow. It is the least of bats, not one inch and a quarter long to the rump; the extent of the wings, six in∣ches and a half; <HI>Pennant's synops. of quad.</HI> p. 370.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The sixth species I call <HI>Barbastelle,</HI> from the
Italian word <HI>barbastello,</HI> which also signifies a bat.
This animal is nearly of the same size with the
long-eared species: Its ears are as broad, but not
near so long. The name <HI>barbastelle</HI> is the bet∣ter
adapted to it, because it appears to have large
<PB N="324" REF="396"/>
whiskers: This, however, is only an appearance
occasioned by the turgidness of the cheeks, which
form a kind of pudding above the lips. The
muzzle is very short, the nose much flattened,
and the eyes near the ears<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The barbastelle has a sunk forehead, long broad ears, the lower part of the inner sides touching each other, conceal the face and head, when looked at in front; the nose is short, and the end of it flatted; the cheeks are full; the upper part of the body is of a dusky brown, the lower ash-coloured and brown: Its length to the rump about two inches, and the ex∣tent of the wings ten and a half; <HI>Pennant's synops. of quad.</HI> p. 370.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Lastly, We shall call the seventh species the
<HI>horse-shoe.</HI> The countenance of this animal is
remarkably deformed. The most striking fea∣ture
is a membrane in the shape of a horse-shoe,
which surrounds the nose and the upper lip. In
France it is very common, and frequents the
walls and vaults of old houses. Some of them are
larger, and others smaller; but they are otherwise
so similar in form, that we consider them as of
the same species. But, as I have remarked this
difference, without finding any of an intermedi∣ate
size, I cannot determine whether it is an
effect of different ages, or a constant variety in
the same species<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This bat has a membrane at the end of the nose in form of a horse-shoe; the ears are long, broad at the base, and sharp pointed, inclining backward: It wants the little or in∣ternal ear. Colour of the upper part of the body cinereous, of the lower, whitish. There is a greater and less variety; the greater is above three inches and a half long from the nose to the tip of the tail; the extent of its wings above fourteen; <HI>Pennant's synops. of quad.</HI> p. 369.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>WE have three species of this animal, the
fat squirrel, the garden squirrel, and the
dormouse, which, like the marmot, sleep during
the winter. Of these the fat squirrel is the lar∣gest,
and the dormouse the least. Several au∣thors
have confounded these three species, though
they are easily distinguishable. The fat squirrel
is about the size of the common squirrel, and has
its tail covered with long hair: The garden squir∣rel
is not so large as a rat, has very short hair on
its tail, excepting near the extremity, where it
is bushy: The dormouse is not larger than the
common mouse; the hair on its tail is longer
than that of the garden squirrel, but shorter than
that of the fat squirrel, and terminates bushy.
<PB N="326" REF="403"/>
The garden squirrel differs from the other two,
by having black spots near its eyes, and the dor∣mouse
by having whitish hair upon its back. All
the three are white or whitish on the throat and
belly; but the garden squirrel is of a fine white,
the fat squirrel only whitish, and the dormouse
rather yellowish than white, in all the under
parts of the body.</P>
<P>These animals are improperly said to sleep du∣ring
winter; for it is not a state of natural sleep,
but a torpor or numbness of the senses and mem∣bers,
produced by a chillness of the blood. The
internal heat of these creatures exceeds not that
of the air. When the heat of the air is ten de∣grees
above the freezing point, their temperature
is precisely the same. I have plunged the ball
of a thermometer into the bodies of several living
garden squirrels, and found their internal heat to
be always nearly equal to the temperature of the
air: I have even seen the thermometer sink a de∣gree
or half a degree when applied to the heart,
the temperature of the air being at that time on∣ly
11°. Now, we know that the heat of man,
and of most quadrupeds, is always more than
30 degrees. It is not, therefore, surprising that
these animals, whose heat is so small, should fall
into a benumbed state, whenever their internal
heat is not augmented by that of the external
air; and this always happens when the thermo∣meter
exceeds not ten or eleven degrees above
the freezing point. This is the true cause of the
<PB N="327" REF="404"/>
torpid state of what are called the sleeping ani∣mals;
a cause which, though common to all a∣nimals
that sleep during winter, has hitherto been
overlooked. I have discovered it in the three
animals under consideration, in the hedge-hogs,
and in the bats; and, though I have never had
an opportunity of examining the marmot, I am
persuaded that its blood, like that of the other
sleepers, is cold; because it is subject to torpor
during the winter.</P>
<P>This torpid state continues as long as the cause
by which it is produced, and ceases with the cold.
A few degrees of heat above ten or eleven is suf∣ficient
to re-animate them; and, if kept in a
warm place during the winter, they are never
benumbed, but go about, and eat and sleep from
time to time, like other animals. When they
feel cold, they roll themselves up in the form
of a ball, in order to expose less surface to the
air, and to preserve their natural warmth. It is
in this form that they are found, during the win∣ter,
in hollow trees, and in holes of walls exposed
to the south. There they lie, without the small∣est
motion, upon moss and leaves; and, though
tossed about, they neither extend themselves, nor
exhibit any signs of life. From this state no∣thing
can rouse them but the application of a
gentle and gradual heat; for they die when sud∣denly
brought near a fire. Though, in this state,
they have no motion, though their eyes are shut,
and they seem to be deprived of every sensation;
<PB N="328" REF="405"/>
yet they feel pain when it is acute. A wound,
or a burn, makes them contract, and utter a low
cry, which they even repeat several times: Hence
their internal sensibility, as well as the action of
the heart and lungs, still subsist. It is presumable,
however, that these vital motions act not with
equal force as when the animal is in its ordinary
state. The circulation, it is probable, proceeds
in the large vessels only; the respiration is slow
and feeble; the secretions are inconsiderable; and
no excrements are voided. There must likewise
be little or no perspiration, since they pass several
months without eating, which could not happen,
if they lost as much of their substance by this
means, as they do at other times, when they
have an opportunity of repairing this natural
waste by taking nourishment. They still, how∣ever,
lose some part; because, in long winters,
they die in their holes. Perhaps, likewise, it is
not the duration, but the rigour of the cold that
destroys them; for they soon die when exposed
to a strong frost. What induces me to think that
they perish not by loss of substance, is, that in
autumn they are exceedingly fat, and equally so
when they revive in the spring. This quantity
of fat serves for an internal nourishment to the
animal, and supplies what it loses by respira∣tion.</P>
<P>As cold is the only cause of their torpor, and
as they fall not into this state but when the tem∣perature
of the air is below ten or eleven degrees,
<PB N="329" REF="406"/>
they frequently revive during the winter; for, in
this season, there are often many days when the
liquor in the thermometer stands at 12, 13, 14,
and even higher degrees; and, during fine weather
of this kind, the dormice come out of their holes
in quest of food, or eat what they had collected
in autumn. Aristotle, and all the succeeding na∣turalists,
have asserted, that the dormice pass the
whole winter without eating, that, in this season
of abstinence, they grow very fat, and that they
are better nourished by sleep alone, than other
animals by food. This notion is both absurd and
impossible. The dormouse, who sleeps four or
five months, could only fatten by the air it re∣spires.
Supposing a part of this air to be convert∣ed
into nourishment, an augmentation so consi∣derable
could never result from it. It would not
even be sufficient to repair the continual waste
occasioned by perspiration. Aristotle might be
led into this error by the mild winters of Greece,
where the dormice sleep not perpetually, but of∣ten
revive, take plenty of food, and are, therefore,
extremely fat, though in a torpid state. The
truth is, they are fat at all times, and particularly
in summer and autumn. Their flesh resembles
that of the Guiney-pig. The Romans reckoned
dormice among their most delicate dishes, and
reared them in great quantities. Varro describes
the method of making warrens for them; and
we learn from Appicius the manner of dressing
them in the high taste of his times. In this
<PB N="330" REF="407"/>
practice, whether from a disgust at these animals,
because they resemble rats, or from the badness
of their flesh, the Romans have not been follow∣ed
by other nations. I have been informed by
peasants who had eat them, that they were not
better than water-rats. Besides, the fat squirrel
is the only species that is eatable; the flesh of
the garden squirrel is bad, and has a disagreeable
flavour.</P>
<P>In manners and dispositions, the fat squirrel
greatly resembles the common species. It lives
in forests, climbs trees, and leaps from branch to
branch, with less agility indeed, because the squir∣rel
has longer legs, and a body more light and
meagre. They both, however, live upon the
same food, namely, filberts, chesnuts, and wild
fruits. The fat squirrel likewise eats small
birds, which he takes in their nests. He makes
not a nest in the tops of trees, like the squirrel;
but he makes a bed of moss in the hollows of
their trunks, or in the cliffs of rocks; but he al∣ways
chooses a dry place. He abhors moisture,
drinks little, and seldom descends on the ground.
He differs still more from the squirrel in this cir∣cumstance,
that the latter is easily tamed, and the
former continues always wild. They couple in
the end of spring, and the females bring forth in
summer, the litter generally consisting of four or
five. The young grow quickly; and we are as∣sured
that they live only six years. In Italy,
where these animals are still eat, the natives dig
<PB N="331" REF="408"/>
pits in the woods, and strew them with straw,
moss, and beach-mast. They choose dry places,
under the shelter of rocks, and with a south ex∣posure.
To these the fat squirrels resort in great
numbers, and the people find them there in a
torpid state towards the end of autumn, when
they are in the best condition for eating. These
small animals are bold, and defend their young
to the last extremity. They bite violently with
their fore-teeth, which are very long, and of
great strength. They neither fear the weasel nor
small birds of prey. They escape from the fox,
because he cannot follow them to the tops of
trees. Their most formidable enemies are the
martins and wild cats.</P>
<P>The fat squirrels are not very generally dif∣fused.
They appear not in very cold climates,
such as those of Lapland and Sweden; at least
they are not mentioned by the northern natura∣lists:
The species they describe is the dormouse,
which is the least of the three. Neither, I ima∣gine,
are they to be met with in very warm coun∣tries,
because our travellers are silent on this ar∣ticle.
There are few or none in open countries,
like Britain; they require temperate climates a∣bounding
with wood. We find them in Spain,
in France, in Greece, in Italy, in Germany, and
in Switzerland, where they live in the forests up∣on
the hills, and not on the tops of high moun∣tains,
like the marmots, who, though subject to
torpor from cold, seem to delight in frost and
snows.</P>

<P>THE fat squirrel dwells in forests, and seems
to avoid the habitations of men. The gar∣den
squirrel, on the contrary, lives in gardens,
and is sometimes found in our houses. The spe∣cies
is likewise more numerous, and more gene∣rally
diffused: There are few gardens which are
not infested with them. They nestle in holes of
the walls, run upon the trees and espaliers, single
out the best fruits, and devour them when they

ought to be careful to destroy the garden squir∣rels.
They also climb with ease pear, apricot,
and plumb-trees; and, when soft fruits are not
to be had, they eat almonds, filberts, nuts, and
even leguminous plants. Of these they carry off
great quantities into their retreats which they dig
in the earth, and particularly in well cultivated
gardens; for, in old orchyards, they are often
found in the hollows of old trees, where they
make beds of herbs, moss, and leaves. Cold be∣numbs
or makes them sleep, and they are revived
by heat. Eight or ten of them are frequently
found in the same place, all benumbed, and rolled
up, in the midst of their provision of nuts and
filberts. They copulate in spring, and bring
forth in summer. The litter consists of five or
six young, who grow very quickly; but who
nevertheless are not fertile till the following year.
Their flesh is not eatable, like that of the fat
squirrel: They have the same disagreeable odour
with the domestic rat; but the fat squirrel has
no bad smell. They never become so fat, and
want those fatty follicles with which the intestines
of the former are entirely invested. The garden
squirrel is found in all the temperate climates of
Europe, and even in Poland and Prussia; but he
appears not to exist in Sweden and the more nor∣therly
regions.</P>

<P>THE Dormouse is the least ugly of all the
rats. It has brilliant eyes, and a bushy
tail, which is rather fair than red. It never lives
in houses, and seldom in gardens; but, like the
fat squirrel, frequents the woods, and dwells in
the hollows of old trees. The species is by no
means so numerous as that of the garden squirrel.
The dormouse is always found alone in its hole;
and there is a considerabel difficulty in procuring
specimens of them. It appears, however, that
they are pretty frequent in Italy, and that they
exist in northern climates; for Linnaeus men∣tions
them, in his list of Swedish animals<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Faun Suec. p. 11.</NOTE>. But
they seem not to inhabit Britain; for Mr Ray<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ray, Synops. quad. p. 220.</NOTE>,
who had seen them in Italy, says, that the <HI>little
sleeping rat</HI> of England is not red on the back,
like that of Italy, and that perhaps it is a different
species. In France, it is the same as in Italy, and
<PB REF="413"/>

<PB N="335" REF="414"/>
is very well described by Aldrovandus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aldrovand. hist. quad. digit. p. 440.</NOTE>; but he
tells us, that there are two species in Italy; the
one is rare, and has the smell of musk; the o∣ther
is common, and has no peculiar odour; and
that, at Bologna, they are both called dormice,
because of their resemblance in figure and size.
We know only the second of these species; for
our dormouse has no smell, either good or bad.
Like the garden squirrel, it wants the fatty folli∣cles
which invest the intestines of the fat squirrel,
never becomes so fat, and, though its flesh has no
disagreeable odour, it makes not good eating.</P>
<P>Like the fat and garden squirrels, the dormouse
rolls itself up and sleeps in winter, revives in
mild weather, and amasses nuts and dry fruits.
It makes its nest upon trees, like the common
squirrel, but generally lower, between the branches
of hazels, or brushwood. The nest, which con∣sists
of interwoven herbs, is about six inches dia∣meter,
and is only open above. I have been as∣sured
by many countrymen, that they have found
these nests in cut woods, and in hedges; that
they are surrounded with moss and leaves; and
that, in each nest, there were three or four young.
When they grow large, they abandon the nests,
and harbour in the hollows or under the trunks
of old trees, where they repose, amass provisions,
and sleep during the winter.</P>

<P>TO this species of rat, which has only been
known for a few years past, I have given
the appellation of <HI>Surmulot.</HI> This animal is
mentioned by no naturalist, excepting M. Bris∣son,
who calls it the <HI>wood-rat.</HI> It is larger and
more mischievous than the common rat. It has
reddish hair, a very long naked tail, and the spine
of the back arched like that of the squirrel. Its
body is likewise thicker; and it has whiskers
like a cat. It is not above nine or ten years since
this species was diffused through the environs of
Paris. From whence these animals came, is un∣certain;
but they have multiplied prodigiously.
Neither is this wonderful, when we consider that
they generally produce from 12 to 15 young at
a litter, and sometimes even the lenght of 19.
They were first discovered at Chantilly, Marly∣la
Ville, and Versailles, where they committed
<PB N="337" REF="416"/>
great ravages. M. le Roy favoured me with
great numbers of them, both living and dead, and
communicated to me the remarks he had made
upon this new species. The males are larger,
stronger, and more mischievous than the females.
When hard pursued, or when we attempt to seize
them, they face about, and bite the stick or the
hand that strikes them. Their bite is not only
cruel, but dangerous; for it is instantly follow∣ed
by a considerable swelling, and the wound,
though small, is long in healing. The females
bring forth three times a year: Hence two indi∣viduals
of this species may produce at least 36
young in 12 months. The mothers prepare a
bed for their offspring. Some of the females sent
us, whom we kept in cages, were with young;
and, two or three days before they brought forth,
we observed that they gnawed the wood of the
cages, and made of the cuttings, which were in
considerable quantities, a convenient bed for their
little ones.</P>
<P>The brown rats have some qualities which make
them approach to the nature of the water-rat.
Though every where diffused, they seem to pre∣fer
the banks of waters. The dogs pursue them
with the same remarkable fury as they chace the
water-rat. When pursued, and they find it equal∣ly
easy to take to the water, or to conceal them∣selves
in brush-wood, they choose the water, enter
it without fear, and swim with great dexterity and
ease. This phaenomenon is chiefly exhibited when
they cannot regain their holes; for, like the long∣tailed
<PB N="338" REF="417"/>
field-mouse, they dig subterraneous retreats,
or rather they nestle in those made by the rab∣bits.
The brown rats may be taken in their
holes by ferrets, who pursue them with equal ar∣dour
as they do the rabbit.</P>
<P>These animals pass the summer in the coun∣try:
And, though they feed principally upon
fruits and grain, they eat young hares, partridges,
and fowls: When they enter a hen-house, like
the pole-cat, they kill more than they can eat.
Towards the month of November, the mother,
and all the young quit the fields, and come in
troops into the barns, where they do infinite mis∣chief,
by mincing the straw, consuming the grain,
and infecting every thing with their ordure. The
old males remain in the fields, each inhabiting
his own hole, where, like the field-mice, they
amass acorns, beach-mast, &amp;c. filling the holes to
the top, and remaining themselves at the bottom.
They sleep not, like the dormouse; but go out
in winter, especially when the weather is mild.
Those who take up their abode in barns, banish
all the mice and rats. It has even been remark∣ed,
that, since the multiplication of the brown
rat about Paris, the common rats are much less
frequent.</P>

<P>OF all modern Naturalists, Gesner has brought
greatest advantages to the science. To
great erudition, he has joined good sense and en∣larged
views. Aldrovandus is only the commen∣tator
of Gesner, and authors of less note have im∣plicitly
copied him. We hesitate not, therefore,
to borrow facts from him with regard to the
Marmots, who are natives of his country, and
concerning whom he was better informed than
us, though, like him, we have kept several of them
<PB N="340" REF="420"/>
in a state of confinement. What he says corre∣sponds
so exactly with our own observations,
that we doubt not the truth of his remarks, when
he retails facts of which we have no knowledge.</P>
<P>The Marmot, when taken young, may be
rendered nearly as tame as our domestic animals.
He learns to seize a stick, to dance, to perform
various gesticulations, and to obey the voice of
his master. Like the cat, he has an antipathy
against dogs. When he begins to be familiar in
the house, and perceives that he is protected by
his master, he attacks and bites dogs of the most
formidable kind. Though not so large as a hare,
he is stouter, and his strength is aided by a pe∣culiar
suppleness and dexterity. With his fore∣teeth,
which are pretty long, he bites most cruel∣ly.
He attacks not, however, either dogs or men,
unless when he is irritated. If not prevented, he
gnaws furniture and stuffs, and, when confined,
even pierces through wood. As his limbs are
short, and his toes fashioned like those of the
bear, he often sits on end, and walks with ease on
his hind-legs. He carries food to his mouth with
the fore-legs, and eats in the manner of a squir∣rel.
He runs pretty quick up hill, but slowly
on a plain. He climbs trees, and mounts between
the cliffs of rocks, or two adjoining walls; and
the Savoyards, it is said, learned from the mar∣mots
to climb for the purpose of sweeping chim∣neys.
They eat every thing presented to them,
as flesh, bread, fruit, roots, pot-herbs, may-bugs,
<PB N="341" REF="421"/>
grass-hoppers, &amp;c.; but milk and butter they
prefer to every other aliment. Though less in∣clined
to theft than the cat, they endeavour to
slip into the dairy, where they drink great quan∣tities
of milk, making, like the cat, a murmuring
noise expressive of pleasure. Besides, milk is the
only liquor that is agreeable to them; for they
rarely drink water; and they refuse wine.</P>
<P>As to figure, the marmot has some resem∣blance
both to the bear and to the rat. It is not,
however, as Perrault, and some others imagined,
the <HI>arctomys</HI> or <HI>bear-rat</HI> of the antients. Its
nose, lips, and form of the head resemble those
of the hare; it has the hair and claws of the bad∣ger,
the teeth of the beaver, the whiskers of the
cat, the eyes of the fat squirrel, and the legs of
the bear. The tail is short, and the ears termi∣nate
abruptly. The hair on the back is of a
reddish brown colour, more or less deep: This
hair is pretty rude; but that of the belly is red∣dish,
soft, and bushy. Its voice resembles the
murmuring of a young dog, when caressed, or in
a sporting humour. But, when irritated or
frighted, it makes a whistling noise, so loud and
piercing, that it hurts the ear. It loves clean∣liness,
and retires, like the cat, to void its ordure.
But, like the rat, it has a very strong disagree∣able
smell, especially in summer. It is remark∣ably
fat in autumn: Besides a large epiploon, it
has two very thick fatty follicles. All the parts
of its body, however, are not equally fat. The
<PB N="342" REF="422"/>
back and reins are loaded with firm and solid fat,
similar to the flesh of a cow's udder. Thus the
marmot would make very good eating, if it had
not always a disagreeble odour, which cannot
be concealed but by very strong seasonings.</P>
<P>This animal, which delights in the regions of
frost and snow, and which is only found on the
tops of the highest mountains, is more subject
than any other to be rendered torpid by cold.
In the end of September, or beginning of Octo∣ber,
he retires into his hole, from which he comes
not out till the beginning of April. His retreat
is made with precaution, and furnished with art.
It is capacious, broader than long, and very deep,
so that it can contain several marmots, without
any danger from the corrupting of the air. With
their feet and claws, which are admirably adapt∣ed
for the purpose, they dig the earth with a∣mazing
quickness, and throw it behind them. It
is not a hole, or a straight or winding tube, but
a species of gallery made in the form of a Y,
each branch of which has an aperture, and both
terminate in one, where the animal lodges. As
the whole is made on the declivity of a mountain,
the innermost part alone is on a level. Both
branches of the Y are inclined, and the one is used
for depositing the excrements of the animals, and
the other for their going out and coming in.
The place of their abode is well lined with moss
and hay, of which they make ample provision
during the summer. It is even affirmed, that this
<PB N="343" REF="423"/>
labour is carried on jointly; that some cut the
finest herbage, which is collected by others, and
that they alternately serve as vehicles for trans∣porting
it to their dens. One, it is said, lies
down on his back, allows himself to be loaded
with hay, extends his limbs, and others trail him
in this manner by the tail, taking care not to o∣verset
him. These repeated frictions are assign∣ed
as the reason why the hair is generally rub∣bed
off from their backs. But, it is more pro∣bable,
that this effect is produced by their fre∣quent
digging of the earth, which is sufficient to
peel the hair off their backs. Whatever may be
in this, it is certain, that they dwell together, and
work in common at their habitations, where they
pass three fourths of their lives. Thither they
retire during rain, or upon the approach of dan∣ger,
and never go out but in fine weather, and
even then to no great distance. One stands sen∣tinel
upon a rock, while the others sport on the
grass, or are employed in cutting it to make hay.
When the sentinel perceives a man, an eagle, a
dog, &amp;c. he alarms the rest by a loud whistle,
and is himself the last to enter the hole.</P>
<P>They make no provisions for winter, as if they
divined that they would then have no use for
victuals. But, when they perceive the first ap∣proaches
of the sleeping season, they set to work
in shutting up the two entrances of their habita∣tion;
and this they perform with such labour
and solidity, that it is easier to dig the earth any
<PB N="344" REF="424"/>
where else, than in the parts they have fortified.
They are at this time very fat, weighing some∣times
twenty pounds; and they continue to be
plump for three months; but afterwards gradual∣ly
decay, and are extremely emaciated at the
end of winter. When discovered in their re∣treats,
they are found rolled up in the form of a ball,
covered with hay; and they are carried off in so
torpid a state, that they may be killed without
seeming to feel pain. The fattest are chosen for
eating, and the young ones for taming. Like
the dormice, they are revived by a gradual heat;
and those which are fed in houses, and kept warm,
never become torpid, but are equally lively and
active in the winter as in the summer. As to the
sleeping of the marmot, we shall not repeat what
was said under the article of the fat fquirrel. The
cooling of the blood is the sole cause of this
pheanomenon; and it has been remarked by o∣ther
writers, that, in this torpid condition, the cir∣culation,
as well as all the secretions, were ex∣tremely
languid, and that the blood, not being
renewed by fresh accessions of chyle, has no sero∣sity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phil. Trans. No. 397.</NOTE>.
Whether they remain constantly torpid
for seven or eight months, as is alledged by most
authors, is uncertain. Their holes are deep, and
they live together in numbers; a considerable
heat, therefore, must be preserved for some time,
and they may eat the herbage they have amassed.
We are even told by M. Altmann, in his treatise
<PB N="345" REF="425"/>
on the animals of Switzerland, that the hunters
allow the marmots to remain unmolested for
three weeks or a month; that they never dig in
soft weather, or during a warm wind; that, with∣out
these precautions, the marmots awaken and
dig still deeper; but that, by opening their re∣treats
during hard frosts only, they find them
so torpid as to be carried off with ease. We may,
therefore, conclude, that they, in every respect,
resemble the dormice; and that, if they remain
longer torpid, it is because they inhabit a climate
where the winter is longer.</P>
<P>These animals produce but once a year, and
the litter generally consists of three or four. The
growth of their young is very quick; they live
only nine or ten years; and the species is neither
numerous nor much diffused. The Greeks were
unacquainted with the marmot, or, at least, they
have made no mention of it. Among the Latins,
Pliny is the first who takes notice of it, under
the name of <HI>mus Alpinus,</HI> or Alpine rat: And,
indeed, though there are several species of rats
in the Alps, none of them is so remarkable as the
marmot, or, like it, live in the summits of the
highest mountains. The other species confine
themselves to the vallies, the sides of the hills,
or first mountains. Besides, the marmot never
descends from the heights, but seems peculiarly
attached to the chain of the Alps, and to prefer
a south or east exposure to that of the north or
west. He is found, however, in the Appen∣nines,
<PB N="346" REF="426"/>
the Pyrenees, and the highest mountains
of Germany. The <HI>bobak</HI> of Poland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Auctuarium Hist. Nat. Poloniae, auct. Rzaczynski, p. 327.</NOTE>, to which
M. Brisson<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Regn. anim. p. 165.</NOTE>, and, after him, Messrs Arnault de
Nobleville et Salerne<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Hist. Nat. des Animaux.</NOTE>, have given the name of
<HI>marmot,</HI> differs from this animal, not only in
colour, but in the number of toes; for it has five
toes on the fore feet. The claw of the great toe
appears beyond the skin; and we find within,
the two phalanges of the fifth toe, which is en∣tirely
wanting in the marmot. Hence the <HI>bo∣bak,</HI>
or Polish marmot, the <HI>mouax,</HI> or marmot
of Canada, the <HI>cavia,</HI> or marmot of Bahama,
and the <HI>cricet,</HI> or marmot of Strasburgh, are all
different species from the Alpine marmot.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="supplement">
<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>I have here given the figure of an animal cal∣led
<HI>Monax,</HI> or <HI>Marmot of Canada.</HI> The design
was sent me by Mr Colinson, but without any
description. This species of marmot seems to
differ from the other marmots, by its having
only <HI>four</HI> toes on the fore-feet, while the Alpine
marmot and the bobak or Polish marmot have
<PB N="347" REF="427"/>
<HI>five</HI> toes both on the fore and the hind feet.
There is also some difference in the form of the
head, which is more thinly covered with hair.
The tail of the monax is longer and less bushy
than that of the common marmot; so that this
Canada animal may regarded rather as a neigh∣bouring
species than as a simple variety of the
Alpine marmot. In this species, I presume, the
animal called the <HI>Whistler</HI> by Baron Hontan,
may be ranked<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage du Baron de la Honton, tom. 1. p. 95.</NOTE>. He says, that it is found in
the northern parts of Canada; that it is nearly
of the size of a hare, but shorter in the body;
that it is hunted only for its skin, which is much
valued; but that its flesh is not good. He adds,
that the Canadians call these animals <HI>Whistlers,</HI>
because, in fine weather, they whistle at the en∣trance
to their holes, which he has frequently
heard. Our Alpine marmot makes the same
kind of whistling noise.</P>

<P>THE Russian travellers have discovered an
animal in Kamtschatka, which they have

only a very slight intimation. They tell us, that
its skin resembles, at a distance, the variegated
plumage of a beautiful bird; that, like the squir∣rel,
it uses its fore-feet in eating; and that it
feeds on roots, berries, and cedar-nuts. It is
worthy of remark, that the expression <HI>cedar-nuts</HI>
presents a false idea; for the true cedar bears
cones, and other trees, called by the name of ce∣dars,
bear berries.</P>

<HEAD>The MARMOT of the Cape of
Good Hope.</HEAD>
<P>WE owe the first notices of this animal to
M. Allamand, a learned naturalist and
professor at Leyden. M. Pallas has described it
under the name of <HI>Cavia Capensis,</HI> and M. Vos∣maer
under that of the <HI>Bastard African Marmot.</HI>
Both have given a figure of it from the same
plate, of which M. Allamand has sent me a copy.
<PB N="349" REF="429"/>
In writing on this subject to M. Daubenton, he
remarks:</P>
<P>'I send you the figure of a species of cabiai,
(I know no other name to give it), which I re∣ceived
from the Cape of Good Hope. It is
not so well drawn as I could wish; but, as I
have the animal stuffed in my cabinet, if you
are inclined, I shall transmit it to you by the
first opportunity.'</P>
<P>We accepted not this obliging offer of M. Al∣lamand,
because we were soon after informed,
that one or two of these animals had arrived in
Holland alive, and hoped that some naturalist
would furnish us with an exact description. Both
Mr Pallas and Vosmaer have accordingly descri∣bed
this animal, and I shall here give extracts
from their remarks.</P>
<P>"This animal," says M. Vosmaer, "is known
at the Cape of Good Hope, under the name of
the <HI>Rock Badger,</HI> probably because it lives a∣mong
rocks, and under the earth, like the badger;
to which, however, it has no resemblance. It
has a greater affinity to the marmot, and yet it
differs considerably from that animal. . . . . Kolbe is the first who mentions this animal, and
he says, that it resembles the marmot more than
the badger."</P>
<P>We shall adopt the name of the <HI>Marmot of the
Cape,</HI> in preference to that of the cavia, because
it differs from the cavia or cabiai in many re∣spects:
1. In the climate, the cavia being an
<PB N="350" REF="430"/>
animal of South America, while the other is found
only in Africa; 2. Because cavia is a Brasilian
word, and ought not to be transported into Afri∣ca,
since it belongs to the true cavia, and to the
cavia-cobaia, or Guiney-pig; Lastly, because the
cabiai inhabits only the margins of waters, and
has membranes between its toes; but the mar∣mot
of the Cape lives among rocks, and in dry
grounds, which it can dig with its claws.</P>
<P>"The first animal of this species," says M.
Vosmaer, "that appeared in Europe, was sent
by M. Tulbagh to the Prince of Orange, and its
skin is still preserved in his cabinet. The colour
of the first differed greatly from that of another
which arrived afterwards: It was very young
and very small. That which I am about to de∣scribe
was a male, and was sent me by M. Berg∣meyer
of Amsterdam. . . . . The life of this
animal, according to my information, is very me∣lancholy;
for it slept much during the voyage.
Its motion is slow, and performed by leaps. But,
perhaps, in a natural state, it is equally active as
the rabbit. Its cries were frequent, but short,
sharp, and piercing."</P>
<P>I shall observe in passing, that this character
brings the animal still closer to the marmot; for
the Alpine marmots often make a sharp whis∣tling
noise.</P>
<P>"In Holland," continues M. Vosmaer, "they
feed this marmot with bread and different kinds
of pot-herbs. It is probable that this animal
<PB N="351" REF="431"/>
brings forth often, and in great numbers. The
form of their feet indicates that they are destined
for digging the earth. The present marmot ha∣ving
died at Amsterdam, I gave it for dissection
to M. Pallas.</P>
<P>"In stature, it resembles the common rabbit,
but it is thicker and more collected. The belly
is peculiarly gross; the eyes are beautiful, and
of an ordinary size. The eye-brows, both above
and below, are garnished with some short black
hairs, above which there are five or six hairs of
the same colour, but long, that turn back toward
the head. It has similar whiskers on the upper
lip, about the middle of the muzzle.</P>
<P>The nose is black, naked, and divided by a
fine future, which descends to the lip. The no∣strils
resemble a cord broke through the middle.
Under the muzzle, on the throat, and the
cheeks, are some long, rude, black hairs; and
hairs of the same kind are scattered over the
whole body. In the palate there are eight deep
furrows; the tongue is very thick, tolerably long,
garnished with small papillae, and oval at the
point. In the upper jaw, there are two strong
teeth, which protrude over the under jaw, and
are considerably distant from each other, having
a kind of triangular appearance. In the under
jaw, it has four close cutting teeth, which are
very broad, long, and flat. The grinders, of
which it has four on each side, are also large;
and a fifth of a smaller size may be added to the

number. Its fore-legs are short, and half cover∣ed
with the skin of the body. The feet are black
and naked. Those before have four toes, the
one in the middle longest; and the exterior one
is shorter, and seems to adhere to the third. The
toes are armed with round short claws, which ad∣here
to the skin like the human nails. There
are three toes on the hind feet; the middle one
only is furnished with a crooked claw, and the
exterior toe is shorter than the others. The ani∣mal
leaps on its hind legs, like the rabbit. It
has not the smallest vestige of a tail. The co∣lour
of the hair is gray, or a yellowish brown,
nearly like that of a wild rabbit; but it is deep∣er
upon the head and back; and the breast and
belly are whitish. There is also a whitish belt
upon the neck and near the shoulders. This
belt forms not a collar, but terminates at the top
of the fore-legs. In general, the hair is soft and
woolly."</P>
