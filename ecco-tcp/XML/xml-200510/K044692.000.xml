<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>JOHN XVII. v. 3.</BIBL>
<Q>This is Life Eternal, that they may
know Thee the only true God, and
Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HAT human kind were not
designed merely to sojourn a
few Days upon this Earth: that
a Being of such Excellence as
the Soul of Man, so capable of a nobler
Life, and having such a high Sense of
Things moral and intellectual, was not crea∣ted
in the sole View of being imprisoned in
an earthly Tabernacle, and partaking a few
Pains and Pleasures which chequer this mor∣tal
Life, without aspiring to any thing ei∣ther
above or beyond it, is a Fundamental
Doctrine as well of Natural Religion as of
the Christian. It comes at once recom∣mended
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
by the Authority of Philoso∣phers
and Evangelists. And that there ac∣tually
is in the Mind of Man a strong in∣stinct
and desire, an appetite and tendency
towards another and a better State, income∣parably
superior to the present, both in
point of Happiness and Duration, is no
more than every one's Experience and in∣ward
Feeling may inform him. The sa∣tiety
and disrelish attending sensual Enjoy∣ments,
the relish for things of a more pure
and spiritual kind, the restless Motion of
the Mind, from one terrene Object of pur∣suit
to another, and often a Flight or Endea∣vour
above them all towards something un∣known,
and perfective of its Nature, are so
many signs and tokens of this better State,
which in the Style of the Gospel is termed
Life Eternal.</P>
<P>AND as this is the greatest Good that
can befal us, the very end of our Being,
and that alone which can crown and satisfy
our Wishes, and without which we shall be
ever restless and uneasy; so every Man,
who knows and acts up to his true Inte∣rest,
must make it his principal Care and
Study to obtain it: And in order to this,
he must endeavour to live suitably to his
Calling, and of consequence endeavour to
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
make others obtain it too. For how can
a Christian shew himself worthy of his Cal∣ling,
otherwise than by performing the Du∣ties
of it? And what Christian Duty is
more essentially so, than that of Charity?
And what Object can be found upon Earth
more deserving our Charity, than the Souls
of Men? Or, how is it possible for the
most beneficent Spirit to do them better
Service, than by promoting their best and
most lasting Interest, that is by putting
them in the Way that leads to Eternal
Life.</P>
<P>WHAT this Eternal Life was, or how
to come at it, were Points unknown to the
Heathen World. It must be owned, the
wise Men of Old, who followed the Light
of Nature, saw even by that Light, that
the Soul of Man was debased, and born
downwards, contrary to its natural Bent,
by carnal and terrene Objects; and that,
on the other hand, it was exalted, purged,
and in some sort assimulated to the Deity,
by the Contemplation of Truth and Prac∣tice
of Virtue. Thus much in general they
saw or surmised. But then about the Way
and Means to know the one, or perform
the other, they were much at a loss. They
were not agreed concerning the true End
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
of Mankind; which, as they saw, was mis∣taken
in the vulgar Pursuits of Men; so
they found it much more easy to confute
the Errors of others, than to ascertain the
Truth themselves. Hence so many Divi∣sions
and Disputes about a Point which it
most imported them to know, insomuch as
it was to give the Bias to human Life, and
govern the whole Tenor of their Actions
and Conduct.</P>
<P>BUT when Life and Immortality were
brought to Light by the Gospel, there could
remain no Dispute about the chief End and
Felicity of Man, no more than there could
about the Means of obtaining it, afer the
express Declaration of our Blessed Lord in
the Words of my Text; <HI>This is Life eter∣nal,
that they may know thee, the only true
God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.</HI>
For the right understanding of which Words
we must observe, that by the Knowledge
of God, is not meant a barren Speculation,
either of Philosophers or Scholastic Divines,
nor any notional Tenets fitted to produce
Disputes and Dissentions among Men; but,
on the contrary, an holy practical Know∣ledge,
which is the Source, the Root, or
Principle of Peace and Union, of Faith,
Hope, Charity, and universal Obedience.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="7"/>
A Man may frame the most accurate Notions,
and in one Sense attain the exactest Know∣ledge
of God and Christ that human Fa∣culties
can reach, and yet, notwithstanding
all this, be far from knowing them in that
saving Sense. For St. <HI>John</HI> tells us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Joh. iii. 6.</NOTE> that
<HI>whosoever sinneth, hath not seen Christ, nor
known him.</HI> And again,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Joh. iv. 8.</NOTE> <HI>He that loveth not,
knoweth not God.</HI> To know God as we
ought, we must love him; and love him
so as withal to love our Brethren, his Crea∣tures,
and his Children. I say that Know∣ledge
of God and Christ, which is Life
eternal, implies universal Charity, with all
the Duties ingrafted thereon, or ensuing
from thence, that is to say, the Love of
God and Man. And our Lord expresly
saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">John xiv. 21.</NOTE> <HI>He that hath my Commandments, and
keepeth them, he it is that loveth me.</HI> From
all which it is evident, that this saving
Knowledge of God is inseparable from
the Knowledge and Practice of his Will;
the explicit Declaration whereof, and of
the Means to perform it, are contained
in the Gospel, that divine Instrument of
Grace and Mercy to the Sons of Men.
The metaphysical Knowledge of God,
considered in his absolute Nature of Es∣sence,
is one thing, and to know him as
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
he stands related to us as Creator, Re∣deemer,
and Sanctifier, is another. The
former kind of Knowledge (whatever it
amounts to) hath been, and may be, in
Gentiles as well as Christians, but not the
latter, which is Life eternal.</P>
<P>FROM what hath been said, it is a plain
Consequence, that whoever is a sincere
Christian, cannot be indifferent about
bringing over other Men to the Know∣ledge
of God and Christ; but that every
one of us, who hath any Claim to that
Title, is indispensably obliged in Duty to
God, and in Charity to his Neighbour, to
desire and promote, so far as there is Op∣portunity,
the Conversion of Heathen and
Infidels, that so they may become Parta∣kers
of Life and Immortality. For, <HI>this
is Life eternal, to know thee the only true
God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.</HI></P>
<P>IN my present Discourse upon which
Words; I shall,<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>First,</HI> CONSIDER in general, the Obli∣gation
that Christians lie under, of
bringing other Men to the Knowledge
of the only true God, and of Jesus
Christ. And,</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="9" REF="9"/><HI>Secondly,</HI> I shall consider it in Reference
to this laudable Society, instituted for
the Propagation of the Gospel. And
under each Head, I propose to obviate
such Difficulties as may seem to re∣tard,
and intermix such Remarks as
shall appear proper to forward so
good a Work.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>NOW although it be very evident, that
we can really have neither a just Zeal for
the Glory of God, nor a beneficent Love
of Man, without wishing and endeavour∣ing,
as occasion serves, to spread the glad
Tidings of Salvation, and bring those who
are benighted in the Shadow of Death, to
Life eternal, by the Knowledge of the only
true God, and of Jesus Christ whom he
hath sent. Yet this Duty, plain and un∣doubted
as it seems, happens to be too of∣ten
overlooked, even by those, whose At∣tention
to other Points would make one
think their Neglect of this, not an Effect
of lukewarm Indifference, so much as of
certain mistaken Notions and Suppositions.
Two principal Considerations occur, which,
in this particular, seem to have slackened
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
the Industry of some, otherwise zealous and
serious Christians.</P>
<P>ONE I apprehend to be this, that it is
surmised, the Christian Religion is in a
declining State, which by many Symptoms
seems likely to end either in Popery, or a
general Infidelity. And that of Course a
prudent Person has nothing to do, but to
make sure of his own Salvation, and to
acquiesce in the general Tendency of things,
without being at any fruitless Pains to op∣pose
what cannot be prevented, to steer
against the Stream, or resist a Torrent,
which as it flows, gathers Strength and
Rapidity, and in the End, will be sure to
overflow, and carry all before it. When
a Man of a desponding and foreboding
Spirit hath been led, by his observation of
the Ways of the World, and the prevail∣ing
Humour of our Times, to think af∣ter
this manner; he will be inclined to
strengthen this his preconceived Opinion,
as is usual in other the like Cases, by Mis∣application
of holy Scripture: For in∣stance,
by those Words of our Blessed Sa∣viour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke xviii. 8.</NOTE>
<HI>When the Son of Man cometh, shall
he find Faith upon Earth?</HI> which have
been applied to this very purpose, as im∣porting
that before the final Judgment,
<PB N="11" REF="11"/>
Christian Faith should be extinguished up∣on
Earth; Although these Words do, from
the Context, seem plainly to refer to the
Destruction of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and the obsti∣nate
Blindness of the Jews, who even
then when they felt the Hand of God,
should not acknowledge it, or believe the
<HI>Roman</HI> Army to be the Instrument of Di∣vine
Vengeance, in the Day of their Vi∣sitation,
by him whom they had injuri∣ously
treated, rejected, and put to Death.</P>
<P>BUT, granting the former Sense might
be supported by no absurd Hypothesis, or
no improbable Guess; yet shall the En∣deavours
of Christian Men for propaga∣ting
the Gospel of Christ be forestalled
by any Suppositions or Conjectures what∣soever?
admitting, I say, those Words
regard the future Advent of Jesus Christ,
yet can any one tell how near or how far
off that Advent may be? Are not the Times
and Seasons foreknown only to God? And
shall we neglect a certain Duty to Day, upon
an uncertain Surmise of what is to come
hereafter? This way of thinking might
furnish as strong Reasons against Preaching
at home, as abroad, within, as without the
Pale of the Church. It would be as speci∣ous
an Argument against the one as the o∣ther,
<PB N="12" REF="12"/>
but in reality can conclude against nei∣ther.
For, as we know not when that sup∣posed
Time of general Infidelity is to be, or
whether it will be at all; so, if it were
ever so sure, and ever so near, it would ne∣vertheless
become us to take Care, that it
may not be an Effect of our own particu∣lar
Indifference and Neglect.</P>
<P>BUT if we take our Notions, not from
the uncertain Interpretation of a particular
Text, but from the whole Tenor of the di∣vine
Oracles, from the express Promise and
reiterated Predictions of our Blessed Lord,
and his Apostles, we shall believe, that
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. ii. 9, 10, 11.</NOTE><HI>Jesus Christ is highly exalted of God, to the
End,
that at his Name every Knee shall
bow, and every Tongue confess that he is the
Lord, to the Glory of God the Father.</HI> That
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. xv. 25.</NOTE><HI>he must Reign till he hath put all Enemies
under his Feet.</HI>
That <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. xxviii. 20.</NOTE><HI>He is with us alway,
even unto the End of the World.</HI>
And that,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. xvi. 18.</NOTE><HI>The Church of the living God, the pillar and
ground of Truth, is so far from being de∣stroy'd
human Means,
that the gates of
Hell</HI> (all the infernal Powers) <HI>shall not pre∣vail
against it.</HI> Let us therefore banish all
such Conceits as may seem to justifie our In∣dolence,
as may reason us out of all courage
and vigour in the Race that is set before
<PB N="13" REF="13"/>
us; let us not, I say, slacken our own Hands,
nor enfeeble our own Knees, by preconceiv∣ed
Fancies and Suppositions, considering
that as the Success of all Enterprises in
great Measure depends on the Spirit of the
Undertakers, so nothing is more apt to raise
a Spirit than Hope; or to depress it, than
Despondency. We ought therefore to shake
off every vain Fear in our spiritual Warfare.
The Number, the Presumption, and the
Abilities of those, who take Counsel toge∣ther
against the Lord, and against his A∣nointed,
should not dishearten, but rather
excite and encourage us to stand in the Gap.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Consideration, that may pos∣sibly
withhold divers sincere Believers from
contributing their Endeavours for bring∣ing
Men to the Knowledge of God and
Christ, and thereby to eternal Life, is the
want of Miracles in the present Age. Men
naturally cast about for Reasons to counte∣nance
the Part they take. And as the Gift
of Miracles was of mighty Influence and
Help to those, who were commissioned to
spread abroad the Light of the Gospel in
its first promulgation, so no Pretence offers
it self more naturally to excuse a Man
from executing any purpose, than the want
of Authority, which, in the Opinion of
<PB N="14" REF="14"/>
Men, cannot be without a just Commis∣sion,
nor this unless distinguished by those
proper Means and Powers that have been
known to attend it. Now, with regard to
this defect of Miracles, I shall beg leave to
make two Observations.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> It is to be observed, that if we have
not Miracles, we have other Advantages
which make them less necessary now, than
in the first spreading of the Gospel: Whole
Nations have found the Benefit of Christ's
Religion, it is protected by Princes, esta∣blished
and encouraged by Laws, supported by
Learning and Arts, recommended by
the Experience of many Ages, as well as
by the Authority and Example of the wi∣sest
and most knowing Men. Certainly,
if the greater Part of Mankind are Gen∣tiles
or Mahometans, it cannot be denied
that the most knowing, most learned, and
most improved Nations, profess Christia∣nity,
and that even the Mahometans them∣selves
bear Testimony to the Divine Mis∣sion
of Jesus Christ. Whereas therefore,
in the Beginning, a few illiterate Wan∣derers,
of the meanest of the People, had
the Prejudices, the Learning, and the Pow∣er
of their own, as well as other Nations,
in one Word, the whole World, to oppose
<PB N="15" REF="15"/>
and overcome: Those who at this Day en∣gage
in the Propagation of the Gospel, do
it upon Terms in many Respects far more
easy and advantageous. It is Power against
Weakness, Civility against Barbarism, Know∣ledge
against Ignorance, some or other, if
not all these Advantages, in the present
Times, attending the Progress of the Chri∣stian
Religion, in whatever Part of the
World Men shall attempt to plant it.</P>
<P>IN the second Place we may reflect, that
if we have not the Gift of Miracles, this
is a good Reason why we should exert
more strongly those human Means which
God hath put in our Power; and make
our ordinary Faculties, whether of the
Head, or the Hand, or the Tongue, our
Interest, our Credit, or our Fortune, sub∣servient
to the great Giver of them; and
chearfully contribute our humble Mite to∣wards
hastening that Time,
wherein <NOTE PLACE="marg">Psalm lxxxvi. 9.</NOTE><HI>all
Nations whom thou hast made, shall come
and worship before thee, O Lord, and shall
glorifie thy Name.</HI> It is at least a plain
Case, that the Want of Apostolical Gifts
should not be pleaded as a Bar to our
doing that, which in no Respect, either
of Difficulty or Danger, equals, or ap∣proaches
the Apostolical Office. What
<PB N="16" REF="16"/>
Pretence can this supply for Mens being
quite unconcerned about the spreading of
the Gospel, or the Salvation of Souls? For
Mens forgetting that they are Christians,
and related to human Kind? How can
this justify their overlooking Opportunities
which lie in their Way, their not con∣tributing
a small Part of their Fortune
towards forwarding a Design, wherein they
share neither Pains nor Peril; the not be∣stowing
on it, even the cheap Assistance
of their Speech, Attention, Counsel, or
Countenance, as Occasion offers? How un∣like
is this worldly, selfish Indifference, to
that Account which St. <HI>Paul</HI> gives of him∣self,
that <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. x. 33.</NOTE><HI>he sought not his own the Profit, but
the Profit of many, that they may be saved.</HI>
And yet herein he expected the <HI>Corinthi∣ans</HI>
(and the same Reason will hold for
us) should be like him; for he subjoins, <HI>Be
ye Followers of me as I also am of Christ.</HI></P>
<P>HAVING considered the Duty in gene∣ral,
I come now to treat of it with Refe∣rence
to <HI>America,</HI> the peculiar Province of
this Venerable Society; which I suppose
well informed of the State and Progress of
Religion in that part of the World, by
their Correspondencies with the Clergy
upon their Mission. It may nevertheless
<PB N="17" REF="17"/>
be expected that one who had been engaged
in a Design in this very View, who hath
been upon the Place, and resided a consi∣derable
Time in one of our Colonies, should
have observed somewhat worth reporting.
It is to be hoped, therefore, that one Part
of my Audience will pardon, what the
other may, perhaps, expect, while I detain
them with the Narrative of a few Things
I have observed, and such Reflections as
thereupon suggested themselves; some
part of which may possibly be found to
extend to other Colonies.</P>
<P><HI>Rhode-Island,</HI> with a Portion of the ad∣jacent
Continent, under the same Govern∣ment,
is inhabited by an <HI>English</HI> Colony,
consisting chiefly of Sectaries of many differ∣ent
Denominations, who seem to have worn
off part of that Prejudice, which they inhe∣rited
from their Ancestors, against the Na∣tional
Church of this Land; though it
must be acknowledged at the same Time,
that too many of them have worn off a
serious Sense of all Religion. Several in∣deed
of the better Sort are accustomed to
assemble themselves regularly on the Lord's
Day for the Performance of Divine Wor∣ship.
But most of those, who are dispersed
<PB N="18" REF="18"/>
throughout this Colony, seem to rival
some well-bred People of other Countries,
in a thorough Indifference for all that is
sacred, being equally careless of outward
Worship, and of inward Principles, whe∣ther
of Faith or Practice. Of the Bulk
of them it may certainly be said, that
they live without the Sacraments, not be∣ing
so much as baptized: And as for their
Morals, I apprehend there is nothing to
be found in them that should tempt others
to make an Experiment of their Principles,
either in Religion or Government. But
it must be owned, the general Behaviour
of the Inhabitants in those Towns where
Churches and Meetings have been long
settled, and regularly attended, seems so
much better, as sufficiently to shew the
Difference, which a solemn regular Worship
of God makes between Persons of the same
Blood, Temper, and natural Faculties.</P>
<P>THE native Indians, who are said to
have been formerly many Thousands, with∣in
the compass of this Colony, do not at
present amount to one Thousand, includ∣ing
every Age and Sex. And these are
all either Servants or Labourers for the
English, who have contributed more to
destroy their Bodies by the Use of strong
<PB N="19" REF="19"/>
Liquors, than by any Means to improve
their Minds, or save their Souls. This
slow Poison, jointly operating with the
Small-Pox, and their Wars (but much
more destructive than both) hath consu∣med
the Indians, not only in our Colonies,
but also far and wide upon our Confines.
And having made Havock of them, is
now doing the same Thing by those who
taught them that odious Vice.</P>
<P>THE Negroes in the Government of
<HI>Rhode-Island</HI> are about half as many more
than the Indians; and both together scarce
amount to a seventh Part of the whole
Colony. The Religion of these People,
as is natural to suppose, takes after that
of their Masters. Some few are baptized;
several frequent the different Assemblies:
and far the greater Part none at all. An
antient Antipathy to the Indians, whom,
it seems, our first Planters (therein as in
certain other Particulars affecting to imi∣tate
Jews rather than Christians) imagined
they had a Right to treat on the Foot
of <HI>Canaanites</HI> or <HI>Amalekites,</HI> together with
an irrational Contempt of the Blacks, as
Creatures of another Species, who had
no Right to be instructed or admit∣ted
to the Sacraments, have proved a
<PB N="20" REF="20"/>
main Obstacle to the Conversion of these
poor People.</P>
<P>TO this may be added, an erroneous No∣tion,
that the being baptized, is inconsistent
with a State of Slavery. To undeceive
them in this Particular, which had too
much Weight, it seemed a proper Step, if
the Opinion of his Majesty's Attorney and
Sollicitor-General could be procured. This
Opinion they charitably sent over, signed
with their own Hands; which was accor∣dingly
printed in <HI>Rhode-Island,</HI> and disper∣sed
throughout the Plantations. I heartily
wish it may produce the intended Effect.
It must be owned, our reformed Planters,
with respect to the Natives and the Slaves,
might learn from those of the Church of
<HI>Rome,</HI> how it is their Interest and Duty to
behave. Both <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> have
intermarried with <HI>Indians,</HI> to the great
Strength, Security and Increase of their
Colonies. They take Care to instruct both
them and their Negroes, in the <HI>Popish</HI> Re∣ligion,
to the Reproach of those who pro∣fess
a better. They have also Bishops and
Seminaries for Clergy; and it is not found
that their Colonies are worse Subjects,
or depend less on their Mother Country,
on that Account.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="21"/>
IT should seem, that the likeliest Step
towards converting the Heathen, would be
to begin with the <HI>English</HI> Planters; whose
Influence will for ever be an Obstacle to
propagating the Gospel, till they have a
right Sense of it themselves, which would
shew them how much it is their Duty to
impart it to others. The Missionaries em∣ployed
by this Venerable Society have done,
and continue to do, good Service, in bring∣ing
those Planters to a serious Sense of Re∣ligion,
which, it is hoped, will in time ex∣tend
to others. I speak it knowingly, that
the Ministers of the Gospel, in those Pro∣vinces
which go by the Name of <HI>New-England,</HI>
sent and supported at the Expence
of this Society, have, by their Sobriety of
Manners, discreet Behaviour, and a compe∣tent
Degree of useful Knowledge, shewn
themselves worthy the Choice of those who
sent them; and particularly in living on a
more friendly Foot with their Brethren of
the Separation; who, on their Part, are al∣so
very much come off from that Narrow∣ness
of Spirit, which formerly kept them
at such an unamicable Distance from us.
And as there is reason to apprehend, that
Part of <HI>America</HI> could not have been thus
distinguished, and provided with such a
<PB N="22" REF="22"/>
Number of proper Persons, if one half of
them had not been supplied out of the dis∣senting
Seminaries of the Country, who, in
Proportion as they attain to more liberal
Improvements of Learning, are observed to
quit their Prejudice towards an Episcopal
Church; so I verily think it might increase
the Number of such useful Men, if Provi∣sion
were made to defray their Charges in
coming hither to receive holy Orders; pas∣sing
and repassing the Ocean, and tarrying
the necessary Time in <HI>London,</HI> requiring an
Expence that many are not able to bear.
It would also be an Encouragement to the
Missionaries in general, and probably pro∣duce
good Effects, if the Allowance of cer∣tain
Missionaries were augmented, in pro∣portion
to the Service they had done, and
the Time they had spent in their Mission.
These Hints I venture to suggest, as not
unuseful in an Age, wherein all humane
Encouragements are found more necessary,
than at the first Propagation of the Gospel.
But they are, with all due Deference and
Respect, submitted to the Judgment of this
Venerable Audience.</P>
<P>AFTER all, it is hardly to be expected,
that so long as Infidelity prevails at home,
the Christian Religion should thrive and
<PB N="23" REF="23"/>
flourish in our Colonies abroad. Mankind,
it must be owned, left to themselves, are so
much bewildered and benighted, with respect
to the Origin of that Evil which they feel,
and from which they are at a Loss about the
Means of being freed; that the Doctrines of
the lapsed State of Man, his Reconciliation
by Christ, and Regeneration by the Spirit,
may reasonably be hoped to find an easy
Admission, as bringing with them Light and
Comfort, into a Mind not hardened by Im∣penitency,
nor fore-closed by Pride, nor
bias'd by Prejudice. But, such is the Va∣nity
of Man, that no Prejudice operates
more powerfully than that in Favour of
Fashion; and no Fashions are so much
followed by our Colonies, as those of the
Mother Country, which they often adopt
in their Modes of living, to their great
Inconvenience, without allowing for the
Disparity of Circumstance or Climate.
This same Humour hath made Infidelity
(as I find it too credibly reported) spread
in some of our wealthy Plantations; un∣educated
Men being more apt to tread in
the Steps of Libertines and Men of Fa∣shion,
than to model themselves by the
Laws and Institutions of their Mother
<PB N="24" REF="24"/>
Country, or the Lives and Professions of
the virtuous and religious Part of it.</P>
<P>BUT this is not all; While those abroad
are less disposed to receive, some at home
are, perhaps, less disposed to propagate the
Gospel, from the same Cause. It is to be
feared, I say, that the prevailing Torrent
of Infidelity, which staggers the Faith of
some, may cool the Zeal, and damp the
Spirit of others, who, judging from the
Event and Success of those, who impugn
the Church of Christ, may possibly enter∣tain
some Scruple or Surmise, whether it
may not be, for the present at least, aban∣doned
by Providence, and that human Care
must ineffectually interpose, till it shall please
God, <HI>yet once more to shake not the Earth
only, but also the Heavens.</HI> This Point hath
been touched before, but deserves farther
Consideration: to the end, that the peculiar
Impiety of a profane Age, may not be a Bar
to those very Endeavours, which it self ren∣ders
more necessary, and calls for more loud∣ly
now than ever.</P>
<P>WHATEVER Men may think, the Arm
of the Lord is not shorten'd. In all this
Prevalency of Atheism and Irreligion, there
is no Advantage gained, by the Powers of
Darkness, either against God, or godly Men,
<PB N="25" REF="25"/>
but only against their own wretched Partisans.
The Christian Dispensation is a Dispensation
of Grace and Favour. The Christian Church
a Society of Men intitled to this Grace,
on performing certain Conditions. If this
Society is diminished, as those who remain
true Members of it suffer no Loss to them∣selves,
so God loseth no Right, suffereth no
Detriment, foregoeth no Good; his Grace
resisted or unfruitful, being no more lost to
him, than the Light of the Sun shining on
desart Places, or among People who shut
their Eyes.</P>
<P>BESIDES, this Excess, this unstemmed
Torrent of Profaneness, may possibly, in the
Conclusion, defeat itself, confirm what it
meant to extirpate, and instead of destroy∣ing,
prove a Means of preserving our Reli∣gion;
the evil Fruits and Effects thereof
being so notorious and flagrant, and so sen∣sibly
felt, as in all likelyhood to be able to
open the Eyes, and rouse the Attention of
those, who may be blind and deaf to every
other Argument and Consideration. Or, who
knows but the Christian Church corrupted
by Prosperity, is to be restored and purified
by Adversity? which may prove, for ought
we can tell, as salutary in future, as it hath
been in past Ages. Many insolent and pre∣sumptuous
<PB N="26" REF="26"/>
Foes have set themselves against
the Church of God; whose Hook neverthe∣less
may be in their Nostrils, and his Bridle
in their Lips, managing and governing, even
their Rage and Folly, to the fulfilling of his
own wise Purposes; and who may not fail
in the End, to deal by them as he did by the
King of <HI>Assyria,</HI> when he had <HI>performed his
Work upon Sin and upon Jerusalem, punish∣ing
their stout Heart and high Looks.</HI> This
presumptuous Conqueror was, without
knowing it, a Tool or Instrument in the
Hands of that God whom he blasphemed.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. x. 5, 6, 7.</NOTE><HI>O Assyrian,
the Rod of mine Anger! I will
send him against an hypocritical Nation, and
against the People of my Wrath will I give
him a Charge to take the Spoil, and to take
the Prey, and to tread them down like the
Mire of the Streets. Howbeit he meaneth
not so, neither doth his Heart think so, but
it is in his Heart to destroy and cut off Na∣tions
not a few.</HI></P>
<P>THUS much at least is evident: It is no
new Thing, that great Enormities should
produce great Humiliations, and these again
noble Vertues, which have often recovered
both single Men, and whole States, even in a
natural and civil Sense. And if the Captivi∣ties,
Distresses, and Desolations of the Jew∣ish
<PB N="27" REF="27"/>
Church, have occasioned their Return to
God, and reinstated them in his Favour;
nay, if it was actually foretold, whenever
they lay under the Curse of God, at the
Mercy of their Enemies, peeled and scat∣tered
in a foreign Land, that nevertheless
upon their calling his Covenant to Mind,
and returning to him, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. xxx. 3.</NOTE><HI>the Lord their God
would turn their Captivity,
and have Com∣passion
upon them.</HI> I say, if Things were so,
why may we not in Reason hope for some∣thing
analogous thereto, in behalf of the
Christian Church. It cannot be denied, that
there was a great Analogy between the Jew∣ish
Institutions, and the Doctrines of the
Gospel; for instance, between the Paschal
Lamb, and the Lamb of God slain from the
Foundation of the World; between the <HI>E∣gyptian</HI>
Bondage, and that of Sin; the earthly
<HI>Canaan,</HI> and the heavenly; the fleshly Cir∣cumcision, and the spiritual. In these and
many other Particulars, the Analogy seems so
plain, that it can hardly be disputed. To be
convinced that the Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> and the
Jewish Oeconomy were Figures and Sha∣dows
of the Evangelical, we need only look
into the Epistle to the <HI>Hebrews.</HI> May we
not therefore, in pursuance of this same A∣nalogy,
<PB N="28" REF="28"/>
suppose a similar Treatment of the
Jewish and Christian Church?</P>
<P>LET us then see, on what Terms the
former stood with God, in order to discover
what the latter may reasonably expect. The
solemn Denunciation to the Jews was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. xxviii. 1.</NOTE> <HI>If thou
shalt kearken diligently to the Lord thy God,
to observe and to do all his Commandments,
which I command thee this Day, the Lord thy
God will set thee on high above all the Nations
of the Earth.</HI> But in case of Disobedience,
it is added among many other Threats and
Maledictions:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ver. 22, 23.</NOTE> <HI>The Lord shall smite thee
with Blasting and with Mildew: and the
Heaven that is over thy Head shall be Brass,
and the Earth that is under thy Feet shall be
Iron.</HI>
And again,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ver. 28</NOTE> <HI>The Lord shall smite thee
with Madness, and Blindness, and Astonish∣ment
of Heart.</HI> Have not the People of this
Land drawn down upon it, by more Ways
than one, the just Judgments of Heaven?
Surely we have felt in a Metaphor the first
of the forementioned Judgments; and the
last hath been literally fulfilled upon us.
Is it not visible that we are less knowing,
less vertuous, less reasonable, in proportion
as we are less religious? Are we not grown
drunk and giddy with Vice and Vanity
and Presumption, and Free-thinking, and
<PB N="29" REF="29"/>
Extravagance of every kind? to a Degree
that we may truly be said to be <HI>smitten with
Madness, and Blindness, and Astonishment of
Heart.</HI></P>
<P>AS antiently most unchristian Schisms and
Disputes, joined with great Corruption of
Manners, made way for the Mahometan in the
East, and the Papal Dominion in the
West; even so here at home in the last Cen∣tury,
a weak Reliance upon human Politics
and Power on the one hand, and enthusi∣astic
Rage on the other, together with car∣nal
Mindedness on both, gave occasion to
introduce Atheism and Infidelity. If the
temporal State, and outward Form of the
Jewish Church was, upon their Defection,
overturned by Invaders, in like manner, when
Christians are no longer governed by the
Light of Evangelical Truth, when we resist
the Spirit of God, are we not to expect, that
<HI>the Heaven above will be as Brass,</HI> that the
Divine Grace will no longer shower down
on our obdurate Hearts, that our Church
and Profession will be blasted by licentious
Scorners, those Madmen, who in Sport <HI>scat∣ter
Firebrands, Arrows and Death</HI>? As all
this is no more than we may reasonably sup∣pose
will ensue upon our Backsliding, so we
<PB N="30" REF="30"/>
may, with equal Reason, hope it will be re∣medied
upon our Return to God.</P>
<P>FROM what hath been said it follows,
that in order to propagate the Gospel a∣broad,
it is necessary we do it at home, and
extend our Charity to domestic Infidels, if
we would convert or prevent foreign ones.
So that a View of the declining State of Re∣ligion
here at home, of those things that
produced this Declension, and of the proper
Methods to repair it, is naturally connected
with the Subject of this Discourse. I shall
therefore beg your Patience, while I just
mention a few Remarks or Hints, too ob∣vious,
perhaps, in themselves to be new or
unknown to any present, but too little vi∣sible
in their Effects, to make one think
they are, by all, much attended to.</P>
<P>SOME, preferring Points notional or ri∣tual
to the Love of God and Man, consider
the National Church only as it stands oppo∣sed
to other Christian Societies. These ge∣nerally
have a Zeal without Knowledge, and
the Effects are suitable to the Cause; they
really hurt what they seem to espouse. O∣thers
more solicitous about the Discovery
of Truth, than the Practice of Holiness,
employ themselves, rather to spy out Er∣rors
in the Church, than enforce its Pre∣cepts.
<PB N="31" REF="31"/>
These, it is to be feared, postpone
the great Interests of Religion to Points of
less Concern, in any Eyes but their own.
But surely they would do well to consider,
that an humble, though confused or indi∣stinct,
Faith in the Bond of Charity, and
productive of good Works, is much more
Evangelical than an accurate disputing and
conceited Knowledge.</P>
<P>A Church which contains the Fundamen∣tals,
and nothing subversive of those Fun∣damentals,
is not to be set at naught by any
particular Member; because it may not, in
every Point, perhaps, correspond with his
Ideas, no not, though he is sure of being
in the right. Probably there never was, or
will be, an established Church in this World,
without visible Marks of Humanity upon
it. Saint <HI>Paul</HI> supposeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">x Cor. iii. 12.</NOTE> that <HI>on the Foun∣dation
of Jesus Christ,
there will be human
Superstructures of Hay and Stubble,</HI> things
light and trivial, wrong or superstitious,
which indeed is a natural Consequence of
the Weakness and Ignorance of Man. But
where that living Foundation is rightly laid
in the Mind, there will not fail to grow and
spring from thence those Vertues and Gra∣ces,
which are the genuine Effects and To∣kens
of true Faith, and which are by no
<PB N="32" REF="32"/>
means inconsistent with every Error in The∣ory,
or every needless Rite in Worship.</P>
<P>THE Christian Religion was calculated
for the Bulk of Mankind, and therefore
cannot reasonably be supposed to consist in
subtle and nice Notions. From the time
that Divinity was considered as a Science,
and human Reason enthroned in the San∣ctuary
of God, the Hearts of its Professors
seem to have been less under the Influence
of Grace. From that time have grown ma∣ny
unchristian Dissentions and Controversies,
of Men <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Tim. vi. 4.</NOTE><HI>knowing nothing,
but doating about
Questions and Strife of Words, whereof com∣eth
Envy, Strife, Railings, evil Surmises, per∣verse
Disputings of Men of corrupt Minds,
and destitute of Truth.</HI> Doubtless, the ma∣king
Religion a notional Thing, hath been
of infinite Disservice. And whereas its ho∣ly
Mysteries are rather to be received with
Humility of Faith, than defined and mea∣sured
by the accuracy of human Reason; all
Attempts of this kind, however well inten∣ded,
have visibly failed in the Event; and
instead of reconciling Infidels, have, by cre∣ating
Disputes and Heats among the Pro∣fessors
of Christianity, given no small Ad∣vantage
to its Enemies.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="33"/>
TO conclude, if we proportioned our
Zeal to the Importance of Things: If we
could love Men whose Opinions we do not
approve: If we knew the World more,
and liked it less: If we had a due Sense
of the Divine Perfection and our own De∣fects:
If our chief Study was the Wis∣dom
from above, described by St. <HI>Paul.</HI>
And if, in order to all this, that were done
in Places of Education, which cannot so
well be done out of them: I say, if these
Steps were taken at home, while proper
Measures are carrying on abroad, the one
would very much forward or facilitate
the other. As it is not meant, so it must
not be understood, that foreign Attempts
should wait for domestic Success, but on∣ly
that it is to be wished they may co∣operate.
Certainly if a just and rational,
a genuine and sincere, a warm and vigo∣rous
Piety, animated the Mother-Country,
the Influence thereof would soon reach
our Foreign Plantations, and extend through∣out
their Borders. We should soon see
Religion shine forth with new Lustre and
Force, to the Conversion of Infidels, both
at home and abroad, and to <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. x. 5.</NOTE><HI>the casting
down high Imaginations,
and every Thing
<PB N="34" REF="34"/>
that exalteth it self against the Knowledge
of God, and bringing into Captivity every
Thought to the Obedience of Christ.</HI></P>
<CLOSER>To whom with the FATHER, and
the HOLY GHOST, be ascribed all
Praise, Might, Majesty, and Domi∣nion,
now and for ever.</CLOSER>
