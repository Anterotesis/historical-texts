<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>DIRECTIONS FOR ROASTING.</HEAD>
<P>In the first place, you must regulate your fire ac∣cording
to the Piece of meat you are to dress:—
If it be a small or thin piece, make a pretty
little brisk fire; but if it be a large joint, let a
very good fire be laid to cake. Take care to
keep your fire always clear, and let your spit be
very clean. When the steam draws near the
fire, it is a sign that the meat is done enough;
but you will best judge of that from the time it
was put down. Observe, that in frosty weather
all kinds of meat take more time in dressing.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>To roast Venison.</HEAD>
<P>TAKE a haunch of venison, and when you have
spitted it, lay over it a large sheet of white
paper, then a thin paste with another sheet of paper
over it, and tie it well to prevent the paste from falling.
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
About five or six minutes before you take it up,
take off the paper and paste, baste it with butter,
and dredge it with a little flour: when you dish it
up, let it be accompanied with some good gravy in
one sauceboat, and sweet sauce in another. If it
be a large haunch, it will take three hours roasting.
The neck and shoulder may be dressed the same
way. The sauce for venison may be either cur∣rent
jelly warmed, or half a pint of red wine, with
a quarter of a pound of sugar, simmered over a clear
fire for seven or eight minutes; or about half a pint
of vinegar, with a proportionate quantity of sugar,
simmered till it becomes of the consistence of a
syrup.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>To roast Mutton.</HEAD>
<P>If it be a Chine or faddle of mutton, you must
raise the skin, and then skewer it on again; for that
will prevent its being scorched. Strip off the skin
about a quarter of an hour before you take it up;
throw some flour on your meat, together with a
handful of salt, and baste it with butter. Roast mut∣ton,
when served up, may be accompanied with
French beans, broccoli, potatoes, cauliflower, horse∣radish,
or water cresses.—N. B. Onion sauce is
frequently used with a shoulder of mutton, either
roasted or boiled.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>To roast Mutton so as to make it eat like Venison.</HEAD>
<P>Having procured a fat hind-quarter of mutton,
cut the leg in the shape of a haunch of venison, lay
it in a pan, and pour over it a bottle of red wine, in
which it must lie twenty-four hours; then put it on
the spit, and baste it with the same liquor and butter
all the time it is roasting. If you have a good
quick fire, your meat will be done in two hours.
You may send it to table with some good gravy in
one bason, and current jelly in another.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
<HEAD>To roast a Pig.</HEAD>
<P>Put into the belly of your pig a few sage leaves
chopped, a piece of butter, a crust of bread grated,
and some pepper and salt; sew it up, spit it, and lay
it down to a large brisk fire. Flour it all over very
thick, and continue to do so till the eyes begin to
start. As soon as you find the skin tight and crisp,
and that the eyes are dropped, set two basons in
the dripping-pan, to receive the gravy that comes
from it. When the pig is done enough, put a lump
of butter into a cloth, and rub all over it, till the
flour is quite off; then take it up into your dish, and
having cut off the head, cut the pig in two down
the back; chop off the ears, and place one upon
each shoulder; cut the under jaw in two, and lay on
each side; melt some butter, put it into the gravy
that came from your pig, boil it up and put it into
the dish with the brains bruised fine, and a little
shred sage; then send the whole to table, with bread
sauce in a bason, and garnish with lemon.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>A Pig barbecued.</HEAD>
<P>Take two or three anchovies, a few leaves of
sage, and the liver of the pig; chop them very
small, and put them into a marble mortar, with half
a pint of red wine, some butter, bread-crumbs, and
pepper: beat them all together to a paste, and sew
them up in your pig's belly; then lay it down to
the fire, singe it well, pour in the dripping pan
two or three bottles of red wine, and baste it with
the wine all the time it is roasting. When it is
almost done, take the sauce out of your dripping-pan,
add to it one anchovy, half a lemon, and a
bunch of sweet herbs, boil these a few minutes,
then take up your pig, put a small lemon, or apple
in its mouth, strain your sauce, and pour it on
boiling hot; lay barberries and sliced lemon round
the pig, and serve it up whole.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
<HEAD>To roast a Leg of Mutton with Oysters or Cockles.</HEAD>
<P>Take a leg of mutton that has been butchered two
or three days before, stuff it all over with oysters or
cockles, and roast it. Garnish the dish with horse∣radish.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>To roast Beef.</HEAD>
<P>Butter a piece of writing-paper, and fasten it with
small skewers to the top of your beef; then lay it
down to a good fire, throw some salt on it, and baste
it well with good dripping. A little while before
you take it up, remove the paper, dredge the meat
with some flour, and baste it with a piece of butter.
Garnish the dish with scraped horse-radish, and send
it to table with broccoli, French beans, potatoes,
horse-radish, or cauliflower. When you want to
keep your meat a few days before you dress it, you
must dry it well with a clean cloth, then flour it all
over, and hang it up in a place where the air may
come to it.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>To roast Veal.</HEAD>
<P>In dressing a fillet or loin of veal, paper the udder
of the fillet to preserve the fat, and the back of the
loin to prevent it from being scorched. Lay your
meat at some distance from the fire till it is soaked,
and then draw it nearer the fire; baste it well with
butter, and dust it with a little flour. The stuffing
for a fillet is made thus: take half a pound of suet,
about a pound of grated bread, some parsley, thyme,
sweet marjoram, and savory, a piece of lemon-peel,
nutmeg, pepper, and salt, and mix them up together
with the yolks and whites of a few eggs.</P>
<P>A breast of veal must be roasted with the caul on,
and the sweet-bread skewered on the back-side:
when it is almost done, take off the caul, and baste
it with butter and a little flour.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
<HEAD>To roast Lamb.</HEAD>
<P>When you lay it down, baste it well with fresh
butter, and scatter on it a very little flour; then baste
it with what drips from it; and just before you
take it up, sprinkle on a little salt and chopped par∣sley,
and baste it again with butter. You may serve
it up with mint sauce, green pease, a sallad, cauli∣flower,
or French-beans.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>To roast a Leg of Lamb with Forcemeat.</HEAD>
<P>Take a large leg of lamb, and with a sharp knife
cut off all the meat, leaving the skin whole with the
fat on it: then chop the meat small with half a
pound of beef suet, some marrow, a few oysters, an
onion, an anchovy, some sweet herbs, lemon-peel,
mace, and nutmeg; and having beat all these toge∣ther
in a mortar, stuff the skin with them, sew it up,
rub it with the yolks of eggs, spit it, flour it all over,
lay it down to the fire, and baste it well with but∣ter:
when done, pour some nice gravy into the dish,
and send it up.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>To roast Pork.</HEAD>
<P>In roasting a loin of pork, you must cut the skin
across in small streaks, and take care that it be joint∣ed
before you lay it down; it is sometimes served
up with onions.—A sparerib should be roasted before
a clear fire, and basted with a small piece of butter,
a little flour, and some sage shred fine: send it up
with apple sauce.—The knuckle of a roast leg of pork
is frequently stuffed with sage and onion chopped
small, with a little pepper and salt, and eat with gra∣vy
and apple sauce. But the best way of roasting a
leg is as follows: first parboil it, then skin it and
lay it down, and baste it with butter; take a little
sage shred fine, a few crumbs of bread, some nutmeg,
pepper and salt; mix these together, and strew them
over your meat white it is roasting: send up some
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
gravy in the dish, and serve it up with apple-sauce
and potatoes. A griskin may be dressed in the same
manner.—N. B. Pork must be well done, otherwise
it is apt to surfeit.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>To roast a Tongue.</HEAD>
<P>You must parboil it first, then roast it; baste it
well with butter, stick ten or twelve cloves about it,
and send it to table with some gravy and sweet sauce.
—N. B. An udder dressed the same way is very
good eating.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>To dress a pickled Neat's Tongue.</HEAD>
<P>Having first soaked it, boil it till the skin will peel
off, then stick it with cloves, put it on the spit, wrap
a veal caul over it, and roast it till it is enough; af∣ter
which you must take off the caul, and serve up
your tongue with gravy in the dish, and some veni∣son
sauce in a boat. Garnish with raspings of bread
and sliced lemon.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>To roast a Calf's Liver.</HEAD>
<P>Lard it with bacon, fasten it on the spit, and roast
it with a gentle fire: send it to table with good veal
gravy, or melted butter.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>To roast Rabbits.</HEAD>
<P>Having trussed your rabbits, put them down to a
quick clear fire, dredge them, baste them well with
butter, and roast them near three quarters of an
hour: boil the livers with a bunch of parsley, and
chop them very fine; then melt some good butter,
put into it half the liver and parsley, and pour it in
the dish; garnish with the other half. The French
sauce for rabbits consists of onions minced small,
fried, and mixed up with pepper and mustard.—
Some people put a pudding in a rabbit's belly, when
they roast it.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
<HEAD>To roast a Hare.</HEAD>
<P>Stuff your hare with a pudding made thus: take
some crumbs of bread, a quarter of a pound of beef∣suet
minced fine, the hare's liver parboiled and
chopped small, some butter, two or three eggs, one
anchovy, a little lemon-peel, parsley, thyme, nut∣meg,
pepper and salt; mix these several ingredients
together, and put them into the belly of your hare,
and then roast it. Put about three pints of milk and
half a pound of fresh butter into your dripping-pan,
which ought to be very clean: baste the hare with
this all the while it is roasting; and when it has
soaked up all the butter and milk it will be done
enough. Serve it up with melted butter and cream,
currant jelly, gravy, or claret sauce.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>Another Way of roasting a Hare.</HEAD>
<P>Take a piece of fat bacon, some bread-crombs,
the liver of the hare, an anchovy, a shalot, some nut∣meg
and winter-savory, chop these fine, beat them
up to a paste, and put them into the hare; then lay
it down to the fire, baste it with stale beer, put a
small piece of bacon in the dripping-pan, and when
it is half roasted, baste it with butter: send it to ta∣ble
with melted butter and savory.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>To roast a Turkey, Goose, Duck, Fowl, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>When you roast a turkey, goose, fowl, or chicken,
lay them down to a good fire; singe them clean
with white paper, baste them with butter, and dust
on some flour. As to time, a large turkey will take
an hour and twenty minutes, a middling one a full
hour; a full-grown goose, if young, an hour; a
large fowl three quarters of an hour, a middling
one half an hour, and a small chicken twenty mi∣nutes;
but this depends entirely on the goodness of
your fire.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10"/>
When your fowls are thoroughly plump, and the
smoke draws from the breast to the fire, you may
be sure that they are very near done. Then baste
them with butter; dust on a very little flour, and as
soon as they have a good froth, serve them up.</P>
<P>Geese and ducks are commonly seasoned with
onions, sage, and a little pepper and salt.</P>
<P>A turkey, when roasted, is generally stuffed in
the craw with force-meat, or the following stuffing:
Take a pound of veal, as much grated bread, half a
pound of suet cut and beat very fine, a little parsley,
with a small matter of thyme, or savory, two cloves,
half a nutmeg grated, a tea-spoonful of shred
lemon-peel, a little pepper and salt, and the yolke
of two eggs.</P>
<P><HI>Sauce for a Turkey.</HI> Good gravy in a boat; and
either bread, onion, or oyster sauce in a bason.</P>
<P><HI>For a Goose.</HI> A little good gravy in a boat, apple
sauce in a bason, and mustard.</P>
<P><HI>For a Duck.</HI> A little gravy in the dish, and
onions in a tea cup.</P>
<P><HI>For Fowls.</HI> Parsley and butter; or gravy in the
dish, and either bread sauce, oyster sauce, or egg∣sauce
in a bason.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>To roast a green Goose with green Sauce.</HEAD>
<P>Roast your goose nicely; in the mean time make
your sauce thus; take half a pint of the juice of
sorrel, a spoonful of white wine, a little grated nut∣meg,
and some grated bread; boil this over a gentle
fire, and sweeten it with pounded sugar to your
taste; let your goose have a good froth on it before
you take it up; put some good strong gravy in
the dish, and the same in a boat. Garnish with
lemon.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>To roast Pigeons.</HEAD>
<P>Take a little pepper and salt, a small piece of but∣ter,
and some parsley cut small; mix these together,
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
put them into the bellies of your pigeons, tying the
neck end tight; take another string, fasten one end
of it to their legs and rumps, and the other to the
mantle-piece. Keep them constantly turning round,
and baste them with butter. When they are done,
take them up, lay them in a dish, and they will
swim with gravy.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>To roast Larks.</HEAD>
<P>Truss your larks with the legs across, and put a
sage leaf over the breast; put them upon a long fine
skewer, and between every lark a little piece of
thin bacon; then tie the skewer to a spit, and roast
them at a quick, clear fire, baste them with butter,
and strew over them some crumbs of bread mixed
with flour; fry some bread crumbs of a nice brown,
in a bit of butter; lay your larks round in your
dish, the bread crumbs in the middle, with sliced
orange for garnish. Send good gravy in a boat.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>To roast a Fowl or Turkey with Chesnuts.</HEAD>
<P>Take a quarter of a hundred chesnuts, roast and
peel them; bruise about a dozen of them in a mor∣tar,
with the liver of the fowl, a quarter of a pound
of ham, and some sweet herbs; mix these together
with some mace, pepper, salt, and nutmeg, and
having put them into your fowl, spit and roast it,
and baste it with butter. For sauce take the rest of
the chesnuts, chop them small, and put them into
some strong gravy, with a glass of white wine, and a
piece of butter rolled in flour: pour the sauce in
the dish, and garnish with water-cresses and sliced
orange.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>To roast Wild Ducks; Widgeons, or Teal.</HEAD>
<P>If your fire be very good and brisk, a teal, wild
duck, or widgeon, will be done in a quarter of an
hour. The following sauce will suit all kinds of
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
wild fowl: take a sufficient quantity of veal-gravy,
season it with pepper and salt, squeeze in a little
claret and the juice of two oranges.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>To roast Pheasanis or Partridges.</HEAD>
<P>Lay them down at a good distance from the fire,
dredge them, and baste them with nice butter, that
they may go to table with a fine froth: they will
take twenty minutes or half an hour roasting: when
you dish them up, let there be some gravy in the
dish, and bread or celery sauce in a boat. Garnish
with slices of orange or lemon.</P>
<P>N. B. You may, if you please, lard turkies, par∣tridges,
pheasants, larks, ortolans, &amp;c. when you
roast them.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>To roast Snipes or Woodcocks.</HEAD>
<P>Truss your snipes, and put them on a small bird∣spit;
dredge them, and baste them well with but∣ter:
have ready a slice of bread toasted brown,
which must be laid in a dish, and set under the
birds while they are roasting. They will take
a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes. When
they are done, take them up, and lay them on
the toast; pour some beef-gravy and melted
butter in the dish, and garnish with orange or
lemon.</P>
<P>N. B. You need not draw a woodcock or snipe
when you roast it.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>To roast Quails.</HEAD>
<P>Let them be stuffed with beef-suet and sweet
herbs chopped and seasoned with a little spice;
spit them, and when they begin to grow warm,

sauce, and garnish with lemon and fried bread-crumbs.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>To roast Plovers.</HEAD>
<P>Green plovers are roasted as you do woodcocks:
Lay them upon a toast, and put good gravy sauce
in the dish. Grey plovers are roasted, or stewed,
thus: Make a force-meat of artichoke bottoms cut
small, seasoned with pepper, salt, and nutmeg: stuff
the bellies, and put the birds into a saucepan, with
good gravy just to cover them, a glass of white

<HEAD>DIRECTIONS FOR BOILING.</HEAD>
<P>Be sure that your pots and covers are well tin'd,
very clean, and free from sand.—Mind that
your pot really boils all the while, else you will be
disappointed in dressing any joint, though it has
been a proper time over the fire. Fresh meat
must be put in when the water boils, and salt
meat whilst it is cold. Take care likewise to
have sufficient room and water in the pot, and
allow a quarter of an hour to every pound of
meat, let it weigh more or less.</P>

spongy. When it is of a carnation colour, it is a
sign of its being good spending meat.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="instruction">
<HEAD>To chuse Mutton.</HEAD>
<P>When mutton is old, the flesh, when pinched,
will wrinkle, and continue so; if it be young, the
flesh will pinch tender, and the fat will easily
part from the lean; whereas, when the meat is
old, the fat will stick by strings and skins. The
flesh of ewe mutton is in general paler than that
of wether mutton; it is of a closer grain, and
<PB N="98" REF="98"/>
parts more easily. When the flesh of mutton is loose
at the bone, and of a pale yellowish colour, it is an
indication of its being somewhat rotten.</P>

<P>If the pork be old, the lean will be tough, and
the fat spongy and flabby; if young, the lean,
when pinched, will break between your fingers,
and when you nip the skin with your nails, it will
make a dent. The skin of pork is in general
clammy and sweaty when the meat is stale, but
smooth and cool when new. When many little
kernels, like hail-shot, are found in the fat of pork,
it is then measly.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="instruction">
<HEAD>To chuse Veal.</HEAD>
<P>When the flesh of a joint of veal seems clammy,

<HEAD>Of CLEAR-STARCHING.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="instruction">
<HEAD>To wash Muslins.</HEAD>
<P>TAKE your muslin aprons, hoods, or neckcloths,
fold them four double, putting the two sel∣vages
together, then the ends together, and wash it
the way the selvage goes, to prevent their f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aying<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
then take clear water, let it not be too hot, for that
makes them yellow, and strain the water through a
cloth; then take the best soap, a small quantity (as
your wash is) put it upon a clean stick, beat up
your lather, let it not be with a whisk, because it
will make the water yellow, and leaves splinters in
the water, which will tear the muslins.</P>
<P>After the lather is beat, put in your foulest
muslins one by one, till you have put all in, let
them stand to soak, then wash them one by one to
<PB N="110" REF="110"/>
prevent tearing, whilst the water is warm; then
squeeze them between both hands, for fear of
leaving the dirty suds in them: As you wash them
out, shake them open into a dish; then let your
second lather be beat up as your first, only let the
water be hotter, but not scalding hot; wash them
whilst they are warm, and squeeze them as before;
then, as to your third lather, let your water be
scalding hot, but not boiling, for that makes the
water yellow; then take a small quantity of pow∣der-blue,
put it in a cup, and put water to it, a
little more than will wet it, then shake the cup
about, afterwards pour it into the scalding water,
and stir it about till it is blue enough; then take
soap and beat up your lather as before, and put
the yellowest muslins in first, then let them be
covered over with a clean cloth: You may wash
them out whilst warm, or let them stand all night
to clear them.</P>
<P>When you wash them out, take care and wash
the blue out, then lay them in clear pump-water;
if you have not time to starch them all at once, put
no more in your starch than you can finish in one
day, for lying in the starch makes them look yellow
and streaky. Let them be in water till you have
time to finish them; but do not excued two
days.</P>
<P>Most starchers boil their muslins, but they
should not, because it wears them out; but
the scalding and letting muslins lie in the suds
do them more good than a boil: Likewise
observe never to soap your muslins, for washing
out the soap will cause you to fray the muslins.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="instruction">
<HEAD>To rince Muslins before you starch them.</HEAD>
<P>Take pump-water in a clean pan, then take a
small quantity of blue in a cup, and put a little
<PB N="111" REF="111"/>
pump-water to it, shake it about in the cup, and
pour a little of it in the rinsing-water, and stir it
about; put your whitest muslins in first, one by
one, and in case any blue should settle, rub them
with your hand lightly in the water, and it will
come off; and if any of your muslins be yellow,
you must make the rinsing-water a little bluer:
After you have rinsed them, squeeze them one by
one, very hard, because they will not take the
starch if any water is left in them, and pull them
out with dry hands, double them upon a clean
dry cloth, in order to starch them. Some people
starch them dry; but they ought not, for it makes
them yellow and stiff, and is very apt to fray
them.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="instruction">
<HEAD>To make Starch for the Muslins.</HEAD>
<P>Take a pint of pump water to a quarter of a
pound of starch, put the water in a skillet, and put
it over a clear fire till it is luke-warm, then put in
your starch, keep it stirring slowly one way till it
boils, one boil and no more, then pour it into a
pan, cover it with a plate till it is cold; when it is
cold, take some upon your hand, and some blue
in the other hand, then mix them together, but
make it not too blue, for the less blue the better:
You need not make any more at a time, keep it not
above a week, for that will make your muslins look
yellow: Take your muslins doubled as before, one
by one, then spread the starch with your hand,
but not too thick, first on one side, and then on the
other, but not open it; then blue the finest muslins
first, and then the thicker, for the starch that
comes out of the finest will starch the thick ones;
and the same starch that comes out of the muslins
will starch aprons, caps and handkerchiefs, for
thin starch is best for them, because they must not
be too stiff.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="112"/>
When you have starched the muslins, lay them
in an earthen dish, kneading them with your dou∣ble
fist till the starch sticks about your hands, then
squeezing them hard, wipe them with a dry cloth,
after that open them, and rub them slightly through
your hands.</P>
<P>When you have opened them, and rubbed
them, take the two ends and so clap them between
your hands, pull them out very well, to you and
from you, to prevent the fraying. Be sure your
hands are dry.</P>
<P>If any of the starch remains on your hands, it
will fray the muslin; dry them well, and as you
pull them out, hold them against the light to see if
they are clapped enough.</P>
<P>If any thing looks shining, that is the starch,
you must rub it over gently; when they are clap∣ped
enough, you will observe them to fly asunder,
and not stick to your hands; but observe to clap
very thick, and very hard, for if you let them dry
they will be limber, so that when you see no
shining, they are clapped enough. You must never
clap them single, for that frays and tears them;
neither clap by the fire, except in frosty weather,
for that spoils the colour.</P>
<P>For the ironing of muslins, pull them out dou∣ble
on the board, as smooth and even as you can,
and so on till you finish about six one upon ano∣ther;
then, with your box-iron, iron the under
two first, because that is the driest, and should be
pretty dry, but not quite dry, that you may iron
them even, and prevent fraying. Let fine plain
muslin be ironed upon a soft woollen cloth; but
if you have any that is coarse or thick, you must
first iron them upon a damp cloth, and then after∣wards
upon your ironing-cloth, the wrong
side.</P>
<P>As for lawns, in the washing and rinsing, do
them as you do muslins; make a very thin starch,
<PB N="113" REF="113"/>
but not water starch; dip them in, and squeeze
them out hard, wipe them with a dry cloth very
hard, and clap them carefully, for they are very
apt to slip; then fold them up, and put them into
a dry pan when they are clapped enough: If
you touch them with any wet, it will leave a sort
of thick look, and so will muslins. You may iron
them on a damp cloth like the muslins, but not with
too hot an iron; and also iron them on the wrong
side, as you do the thick muslins.</P>
<P>You must not starch with starch left from other
things, therefore make fresh as before, and see
that the same be a little matter bluer than be∣fore.</P>
<P>As for night-caps, aprons, &amp;c. you must starch
them in very thin starch, which comes from the
muslins; but it must be thicker than water starch,
a small matter of clapping serves them; but ob∣serve
that they are clear; you must also pull them
out towards the gathers, to prevent the fraying
them. Every way double them, and lay them on
the board as even as you can, and let them lie till
they are pretty near dry; then put them even, and
iron them on the wrong sides.</P>
<P>To do lace the best way, you must sew tape to
each side of the lace, then wash it amongst other
muslins, or by itself, in three lathers, and if it
looks not white, put it into warm butter-milk,
and let it lie a day, then hang it to dry, and then
wash it out in two or three lathers, but the lathers
must be blue, after which take it out, and pin it
upon your board by the tapes very even; then
take muslins the length of the lace, and dip it in
water starch, and so lay it upon the lace till it
dries; observe not to squeeze any of the starch out
of the muslin.</P>
<P>When the lace is dry, take off the tapes;
after which pick the purls and the foot very
tenderly.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="114"/>
If you open the purls, you must make a round
hardish pillow, and lay paper on it, which will
shew the purls the plainer; afterwards lay the
lace upon the paper, and, with a long slender nee∣dle,
with a bit of wax at the head, you may easily
open them, if they are well picked out at first;
after you have opened them, lay them upon a
board, with a muslin over them, and iron them with
an iron not too hot.</P>

<HEAD>Of Brewing Strong OCTOBER BEER.</HEAD>
<P>CARE, in the first place, must be taken that
the malt be very clean, and when it is ground,
it should stand four and twenty hours at least in the
sacks.</P>
<P>The quantity is five quarters of malt to three
hogsheads of beer, and eighteen pounds of hops,
unless the malt be pale dried, then there must be
added three or four pounds more.</P>
<P>The choice of liquor for brewing is of consider∣able
advantage, the softest and cleanest water is the
best.</P>
<P>You are to boil your first liquor, adding a hand∣ful
or two of hops to it, then, before your strike it
over to your malt, cool it in as much liquor as will
bring it to a temper, not to scald the malt; for it
is a fault not to take the liquor as high as possible,
but not to scald.</P>
<P>The next liquors do the same.</P>
<P>And, indeed, all your liquors ought to be taken
as high may be, that is, not to scald.</P>
<P>When you let your wort from your malt into the
under-back, put to it a handful or two of hops, it
will preserve it from that accident which brewers
call, Blinking or Foxing.</P>
<P>In boiling your worts, the first wort boil high
or quick; for the quicker the wort is boiled the
better it is.</P>
<P>The second boil more than the first, and the third
or last more than the second.</P>
<P>In cooling, lay your worts thin, and let each be
well cooled, and care must be taken in letting them
down into the tun, that you do it leisurely, to the
end, that as little of the foeces, or sediment, as
<PB N="137" REF="135"/>
possible, may pass with it, which causes the fer∣mentation
to be fierce or mild, for,</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> There is in all fermented liquors salt and
sulphur, and to keep these two bodies in a due pro∣portion,
that the salt does not exalt itself above
the sulphur, consists a great Part of the art in
brewing.</P>
<P>When your wort is first let into your tun, put
but a little yeast to it, and let it work by degrees
quietly, and if you find it works but moderate,
whip in the yeast two or three times or more,
till you find your drink well fermented, for without
a full opening of the body by fermentation, it
will not be perfectly fine, nor will it drink clean
or light.</P>
<P>When you cleanse, do it by a cock from your
tun, placed six inches from the bottom, to the
end that most of the sediment may be left behind,
which may be thrown on your malt to mend your
small-beer.</P>
<P>When your drink is tunned, fill your vessel full;
let it work at the bung hole, and have a reserve in
a small cask to fill it up, and do not put any of the
drink, which will be under the yeast after it is
worked over, into your vessels; but put it by itself
into another cask, for it will not be so good as your
other in the cask.</P>
<P>This done, you must wait for the finishing the
fermentation; then stop it close, and let it stand
till the Spring, for brewing ought to be done in
the month of October, that it may have time to
settle and digest all the winter season.</P>
<P>In the Spring you must unstop your vent-hole,
and thereby see whether your drink doth ferment
or not; for as soon as the warm weather comes,
your drink will have another fermentation, which,
when it is over, let it be again well stopped, and
stand till September, or longer, and then peg it if
you find it pretty fine, the hop well rotted, and of
a good taste for drinking.</P>

<HEAD>Another Way to brew Ale.</HEAD>
<P>Allow five bushels and a half of malt to half a
hogshead of ale; put into your mashing-tub forty-five
gallons of liquor, because, one-third part of the
liquor will be soaked up by the malt, and a sixth-part
will waste in boiling. For the second wort, put
but a little more liquor than you intend to make
drink; and, if you have a large quantity of malt,
you may make a third wort, putting in liquor, ac∣cording
to the quantity you would have.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>Another Way of brewing Strong and Small Beer.</HEAD>
<P>Let the water boil before you put it into the
mashing-vat, and let it stand till the steam is off
about one hogshead of water; then take your malt,
and strew it in with a hand-bowl, another keeping
it stirring till it grows thick; then put in more
water and malt as before, till you have got your
quantity; reserve some malt to cover the top about
one inch thick; let it stand three hours, then draw
it off at the bottom, and pour it in at the top till it
runs fine; put your hops to the fine liquor, and keep
them stirring till your liquor is ready to boil, then
put them into the copper.</P>
<P>Twenty bushels of malt will make two hogsheads
of strong, and four of small beer: Ten pounds of
hops are sufficient. Or twenty bushels of malt will
make four hogsheads of good ale, and two of small
beer; but then you must put but eight pounds of
hops to it, and let it not boil above an hour and an
half.</P>

let there be provided another shorter broom of about
a foot and a half long, that wich one hand may be
so employed in the upper and other parts as to clean
the cask well: So in a hogshead or other smaller

with water, or with water and sand, or ashes, and
be effectually cleansed; the outside of the cask,

<HEAD>SOME
GENERAL RULES
TO BE OBSERVED IN
COOKERY.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE we conclude this Work, we think
it may not be improper to give our readers
some General Rules in Cookery.<LIST>
<ITEM N="1">I. In all soups you must observe not to put in
your thickening, 'till your herbs are very tender.</ITEM>
<ITEM N="2">II. When you boil any greens, first soak them
near two hours in water and salt, or else boil them
in water and salt in a copper by themselves, with
a great quantity of water: Boil no meat with them
for that discolours them.</ITEM>
<ITEM N="3">III. Use no iron pans, &amp;c. for they are not proper;
but let them be copper, brass, or silver.</ITEM>
<ITEM N="4">IV. When you fry any Fish, first dip them in
yolks of eggs, and fry them rather in a stew-pan
over the fire, and that will make them of a light
gold colour.</ITEM>
<ITEM N="5"><PB N="164" REF="160"/>
V. White sauces being now more generally used
than brown; these are chiefly to be made so with
cream, and adding a little Champaign or French
white wine, and butter rolled up in flour.</ITEM>
<ITEM N="6">VI. Parboil all your meats that you use for fri∣casees,
or else stewing them too long on the fire will
make them hard.</ITEM>
<ITEM N="7">VII. In roasting or boiling, a quarter of an hour
to every pound of meat, at a steady fire, is the best
rule that can be given to do it to perfection.</ITEM>
<ITEM N="8">VIII. When you beat almonds, always put in
orange flower-water, or rose-water, to prevent their
turning to oil, which they are subject to.</ITEM>
<ITEM N="9">IX. When you dress mutton, pigeons, &amp;c. in
blood, always wring in some lemon-juice, to keep
it from changing.</ITEM>
<ITEM N="10">X. When you grill any thing, let it be over a
stove of charcoal, rather than sea-coal; it makes
it eat sweeter and shorter; turn your meat very
often.</ITEM>
