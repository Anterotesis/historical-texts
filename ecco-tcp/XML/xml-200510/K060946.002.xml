<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A Dispute very learnedly handled by two
Ladies, in which the Reader may take
what Part he pleases.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>R. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who was too much
in Love to pass the Night with
any great Degree of Tranquillity,
under the Apprehensions he felt;
it being the Nature of that Pas∣sion,
to magnify the most inconsiderable
Trifles into Things of the greatest Import∣ance,
when they concern the beloved Ob∣ject;
did not fail to torment himself with
a thousand different Fears, which the mysteri∣ous
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
Behaviour of his Father, and the more
mysterious Words of his Mistress, gave Rise to.
Among many various Conjectures, all equally
unreasonable, he fixed upon one, no way ad∣vantageous
to Sir <HI>Charles;</HI> for, supposing that
the Folly of <HI>Arabella</HI> had really disgusted him,
and made him desirous of breaking off the de∣signed
Match between them; he was, as he
thought, taking Measures to bring this about,
knowing, that if Lady <HI>Bella</HI> refused to fulfil
her Father's Desire in this Particular, a very
considerable Estate would descend to him.</P>
<P>Upon any other Occasion, Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>
would not have suspected his Father of so un∣generous
an Action; but Lovers think every
thing possible, which they fear; and being pre∣possessed
with this Opinion, he resolved the
next Morning to sound his Father's Inclina∣tions,
by intreating him to endeavour to pre∣vail
upon Lady <HI>Bella</HI> to marry him before her
Year of Mourning for the marquis was ex∣pired.</P>
<P>Attending him, therefore, at Breakfast, in
his own Chamber, he made his designed Re∣quest,
not without heedfully observing his
Countenance at the same time; and trembling,
lest he should make him an Answer, that
might confirm his uneasy Suspicion.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> however, agreeably surprised
him, by promising to comply with his Desire
that Day; for, added he, tho' my Niece has
some odd ways, yet, upon the Whole, she is a
very accomplished Woman; and when you
are her Husband, you may probably find the
Means of curing her of those little Follies,
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
which at present are conspicuous enough; but
being occasioned by a Country Education, and
a perfect Ignorance of the World, the In∣struction,
which then you will not scruple to
give her, and which, from a Husband, with∣out
any Offence to her Delicacy, she may
receive, may reform her Conduct; and make
her Behaviour as complete, as, it must be
confessed, both her Person and Mind now
are.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> having acquiesced in the Jus∣tice
of this Remark, as soon as Breakfast was
over, went to visit the two Ladies, who ge∣nerally
drank their Chocolate together.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> being then in Lady <HI>Bella</HI>'s
Apartment, he was immediately admitted,
where he found them engaged in a high Dis∣pute;
and, much against his Will, was obliged
to be Arbitrator in the Affair, they having, up∣on
his Entrance, both appealed to him.</P>
<P>But, in order to place this momentous Af∣fair
in a true Light, 'tis necessary to go back a
little, and acquaint the Reader with what had
passed in the Apartment; and also, following
the Custom of the Romance and Novel-Wri∣ters,
in the Heart, of our Heroine.</P>
<P>No sooner were her fair Eyes open in the
Morning, than the unfortunate Sir <HI>George</HI> pre∣senting
himself to her Imagination, her Thoughts
to use <HI>Scudery</HI>'s Phrase, were at a cruel War with
each other: She wished to prevent the Death
of this obsequious Lover; but she could not re∣solve
to preserve his Life, by giving him that
Hope he required; and without which, she
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
feared, it would be impossible for him to
live.</P>
<P>After pondering a few Hours upon the Ne∣cessity
of his Case, and what a just Regard to
her own Honour required of her, Decorum
prevailed so much over Compassion, that she
resolved to abandon the miserable Sir <HI>George</HI>
to all the Rigour of his Destiny; when, hap∣pily
for the disconsolate Lover, the History of
the fair <HI>Amalazotha</HI> coming into her Mind,
she remembred, that this haughty Princess,
having refused to marry the Person, her Fa∣ther
recommended to her, because he had not
a Crown upon his Head; nevertheless, when he
was dying for Love of her, condescended to
visit him, and even to give him a little Hope,
in order to preserve his Life: See conceived it
could be no Blemish to her Character, if she
followed the Example of this most glorious
Princess; and suffered herself to relax a little in
her Severity, to prevent the Effects of her Lo∣ver's
Despair.</P>
<P>Fear not, <HI>Arabella,</HI> said she to herself; fear
not to obey the Dictates of thy Compassion,
since the glorious <HI>Amalazontha</HI> justifies, by her
Example, the Means thou wilt use to preserve
a noble Life, which depends upon a few Words
thou shalt utter.</P>
<P>When she had taken this Resolution, she
rung her Bell for her Women; and as soon as
she was dressed, she dismissed them all but <HI>Lucy,</HI>
whom she ordered to bring her Paper and Pens,
telling her, she would write an Answer to Sir
<HI>George</HI>'s Letter.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy</HI> obeyed with great Joy; but by that
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
time she had brought her Lady all the Mate∣rials
for Writing, her Mind was changed; she
having reflected, that <HI>Amalazontha,</HI> whose Ex∣ample,
in order to avoid the Censure of future
Ages, she was resolved exactly to follow, did
not write to <HI>Ambiome<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> but paid him a Visit,
she resolved to do the like; and therefore bid
<HI>Lucy</HI> take them away again, telling her: She
had thought better of it, and would not write
to him.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy,</HI> extremely concerned at this Resolution,
obeyed her very slowly, and with greeat seem∣ing
Regret.</P>
<P>I perceive, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> you are afraid, I
shall abandon the unfortunate Man you so∣licit▪
for, to the Violence of his Despair; but
tho' I do not intend to write to him, yet I'll
make use of a Method, perhaps as effectual;
for, to speak truly, I mean to make him a Visit;
for by this time his Fever is, I suppose, vio∣lent
enough to make him keep his Bed.</P>
<P>And will you be so good, Madam, said
<HI>Lucy,</HI> to go and see the poor Gentleman? I
warrant you, he will be ready to die for Joy,
when he sees you.</P>
<P>There must be proper Precautions used, said
<HI>Arabella,</HI> to prevent those Consequences, which
the sudden and unexpected Sight of me may
produce. Those about him, I suppose, will have
Discretion enough for that: Therefore give Or∣ders
for the Coach to be made ready, and tell
my Women, they must attend me; and be
sure you give them Directions, when I enter
Sir <HI>George</HI>'s Chamber, to stay at a convenient
Distance, in order to leave me an Opportunity
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
of speaking to him, without being heard: As
for you, you may approach the Bed-side with
me; since, being my Confident, you may hear
all we have to say.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> having thus settled the Ceremonial
of her Visit, according to the Rules prescribed
by Romances, sat down to her Tea-table,
having sent to know, if Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> was up,
and received for Answer, that she would at∣tend
her at Breakfast.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> who had at first determined to
say nothing of this Affair to her Cousin, could
not resist the Desire she had of talking upon a
Subject so interesting; and, telling her with a
Smile, that she was about to make a very
charitable Visit that Morning, asked her, if
she was disposed to bear her Company in it.</P>
<P>I know you Country Ladies, said Miss
<HI>Glanville,</HI> are very fond of visiting your sick
Neighbours: For my Part, I do not love such
a grave kind of Amusement; yet, for the sake
of the Airing, I shall be very willing to attend
you.</P>
<P>I think, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> with a more serious
Air than before, it behoves every generous Per∣son
to compassionate the Misfortunes of their
Acquaintance and Friends, and to relieve them
as far as lies in their Power; but those Miseries
we ourselves occasion to others, demand, in a
more particular Manner, our Pity; and, if con∣sistent
with Honour, our Relief.</P>
<P>And pray, returned Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> who is
it you have done any Mischief to, which you
are to repair by this charitable Visit, as you
call it?</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="9"/>
The Mischief I have done, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI>
blushing, and casting down her Eyes, was not
voluntary, I assure you: Yet I will not scruple
to repair it, if I can; tho', since my Power is
confined by certain unavoidable Laws, my En∣deavours
may not haply have all the Success I
could wish.</P>
<P>Well, but, dear Cousin, interrupted Miss
<HI>Glanville,</HI> tell me in plain <HI>English,</HI> what this
Mischief is, which you have done; and to what
Purpose you are going out this Morning?</P>
<P>I am going to pay a Visit to Sir <HI>George Bell∣mour,</HI>
replied <HI>Arabella;</HI> and I intreat you, fair
Cousin, to pardon me for robbing you of so
accomplished a Lover. I really always thought
he was in Love with you, till I was undeceiv∣ed
by some Words he spoke Yesterday; and
a Letter I received from him last Night, in
which he has been bold enough to declare his
Passion to me, and, through the Apprehension
of my Anger, is this Moment dying with
Grief; and 'tis to reconcile him to Life, that
I have prevailed upon myself to make him a
Visit; in which charitable Design, as I said
before, I should be glad of your Company.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> who believed not a Word
Lady <HI>Bella</HI> had said, burst out a laughing, at a
Speech, that appeared to her so extremely false
and ridiculous.</P>
<P>I see, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> you are of a Humour
to divert yourself with the Miseries of a de∣spairing
Lover; and in this Particular, you
greatly resemble the fair and witty <HI>Doralisa,</HI>
who always jested at such Maladies as are oc∣casioned
by Love: However, this Insensibility
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
does not become you so well as her, since
all her Conduct was conformable to it, no Marr
in the World being bold enough to talk to her
of Love; but you, Cousin, are ready, even by
your own Confession, to listen to such Dis∣courses
from any body; and therefore this Be∣haviour,
in you, may be with more Justice
termed Levity, than Indifference.</P>
<P>I perceive, Cousin, said Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> I
have always the worst of those Comparisons
you are pleased to make between me and other
People; but, I assure you, as free and indis∣creet
as you think me, I should very much
scruple to visit a Man, upon any Occasion
whatever.</P>
<P>I am quite astonished, Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> re∣sumed
<HI>Arabella,</HI> to hear you assume a Cha∣racter
of so much Severity; you, who have
granted Favours of a Kind in a very great De∣gree
criminal.</P>
<P>Favours! interrupted Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> crimi∣nal
Favours! Pray explain yourself, Madam.</P>
<P>Yes, Cousin, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> I repeat it again;
criminal Favours, such as allowing Persons to
talk to you of Love; not forbidding them to
write to you; giving them Opportunities of
being alone with you for several Moments to∣gether;
and several other Civilities of the like
Nature, which no Man can possibly merit, un∣der
many Years Services, Fidelity, and Pains:
All these are criminal Favours, and highly blame∣able
in a Lady, who has any Regard for her
Reputation.</P>
<P>All these, replied Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> are no∣thing
in Comparison of making them Visits; and
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
no Woman, who has any Reputation at all,
will be guilty of taking such Liberties.</P>
<P>What! Miss, replied, <HI>Arabella,</HI> will you
dare, by this Insinuation, to cast any Censures
upon the Virtue of the divine <HI>Mandana,</HI> the
haughty <HI>Amalazontha,</HI> the fair <HI>Statira,</HI> the cold
and rigid <HI>Parisatis,</HI> and many other illustrious
Ladies, who did not scruple to visit their Lo∣vers,
when confined to their Beds, either by
the Wounds they received in Battle, or the
more cruel and dangerous ones they suffered
from their Eyes? These chaste Ladies, who ne∣ver
granted a Kiss of their Hand to a Lover,
till he was upon the Point of being their Hus∣band,
would nevertheless most charitably con∣descend
to approach their Bed-side, and speak
some compassionate Words to them, in order
to promote their Cure, and make them submit
to live; nay, these divine Beauties would not
refuse to grant the same Favour to Persons
whom they did not love, to prevent the fatal
Consequences of their Despair.</P>
<P>Lord, Madam! interrupted Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI>
I wonder you can talk so blasphemously, to call
a Parcel of confident Creatures divine, and
such terrible Words.</P>
<P>Do you know, Miss, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> with a
stern Look, that 'tis of the greatest Princesses
that ever were, whom you speak in this irre∣verent
Manner? Is it possible, that you can be
ignorant of the sublime Quality of <HI>Mandana,</HI>
who was the Heiress of Two powerful King∣doms?
Are you not sensible, that <HI>Amalazontha</HI>
was Queen of <HI>Turringia?</HI> And will you pre∣tend
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
to deny the glorious Extraction of <HI>Statira</HI>
and <HI>Parisatis,</HI> Princesses of <HI>Persia?</HI></P>
<P>I shall not trouble myself to deny any thing
about them, Madam, said Miss <HI>Glanville;</HI> for
I never heard of them before; and really I do
not choose to be always talking of Queens and
Princesses, as if I thought none but such great
People were worthy my Notice: It looks so
affected, I shuld imagine every one laughed
at me, that heard me.</P>
<P>Since you are so very scrupulous, returned
<HI>Arabella,</HI> that you dare not imitate the Sublimest
among Mortals, I can furnish you with many
Examples, from the Conduct of Persons, whose
Quality was not much superior to yours, which
may reconcile you to an Action, you at present,
with so little Reason, condemn: And, to name
but One among some Thousands, the fair <HI>Cleo∣nice,</HI>
the most rigid and austere Beauty in all <HI>Sar∣dis,</HI>
paid several Visits to the passionate <HI>Ligda∣mis,</HI>
when his Melancholy, at the ill Success of
his Passion, threw him into a Fever, that con∣fined
him to his Bed.</P>
<P>And pray, Madam, who was that <HI>Cleonice?</HI>
said Miss <HI>Glanville;</HI> and where did she live?</P>
<P>In <HI>Sardis,</HI> I tell you, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> in the
Kingdom of <HI>Lydia.</HI></P>
<P>Oh! then it is not in our Kingdom, said
Miss <HI>Glanville:</HI> What signifies what Foreigners
do? I shall never form my Conduct, upon the
Example of Outlandish People; what is com∣mon
enough in their Countries, would be very
particular here; and you can never persuade me,
that it is seemly for Ladies to pay Visits to
Men in their Beds.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="13"/>
A Lady, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> extremely angry at
her Cousin's Obstinacy, who will suffer Men
to press her Hand, write to her, and talk to
her of Love, ought to be ashamed of such an
affected Niceness, as that you pretend to.</P>
<P>I insist upon it, Madam, said Miss <HI>Glan∣ville,</HI>
that all those innocent Liberties you rail
at, may be taken by any Woman, without
giving the World room to censure her: but,
without being very bold and impudent, she
cannot go to see Men in their Beds; a Free∣dom
that only becomes a Sister, or near Re∣lation.</P>
<P>So then, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> reddening with
Vexation, you will persist in affirming the di∣vine
<HI>Mandana</HI> was impudent?</P>
<P>If she paid such indiscreet Visits as those, she
was, said Miss <HI>Glanville.</HI></P>
<P>Oh Heavens! cried <HI>Arabella,</HI> have I lived
to hear the most illustrious Princess, that ever
was in the World, so shamefully reflected
on?</P>
<P>Bless me, Madam! said Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> what
Reason have you to defend the Character of
this Princess so much? She will hardly thank
you for your Pains, I fansy.</P>
<P>Were you acquainted with the Character of
that most generous Princess, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> you
would be convinced, that she was sensible of
the smallest Benefits; but it is not with a View
of acquiring her Favour, that I defend her
against your inhuman Aspersions, since it is
more than Two thousand Years since she died;
yet common Justice obliges me to vindicate a
Person so illustrious for her Birth and Virtue;
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
and were you not my Cousin, I should express
my Resentment in another Manner, for the
Injury you do her.</P>
<P>Truly, said Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> I am not much
obliged to you Madam, for not downright
quarrelling with me for one that has been in
her Grave Two thousand Years: However,
nothing shall make me change my Opinion,
and I am sure most People will be of my Side
of the Argument.</P>
<P>That Moment Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> sending for
Permission to wait upon <HI>Arabella,</HI> she ordered
him to be admitted, telling Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> she
would acquaint her Brother with the Dispute:
To which she consented.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Which inculcates by a very good Example,
that a Person ought not to be too hasty in
deciding a Question he does not perfectly
understand.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>YOU are come very opportunely, Sir, said.
<HI>Arabella,</HI> when he entered the Room, to
be Judge of a great Controversy between Miss
<HI>Glanville</HI> and myself. I beseech you therefore,
let us have your Opinion upon the Matter.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> maintains, that it is less cri∣minal
in a Lady to hear Persons talk to her of
Love, allow them to kiss her Hand, and permit
them to write to her, than to make a charitable
Visit to a Man who is confined to his Bed
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
through the Violence of his Passion and De∣spair;
the Intent of this Visit being only to pre∣vent
the Death of an unfortunate Lover, and,
if necessary, to lay her Commands upon him
to live.</P>
<P>And this latter is your Opinion, is it not
Madam? said Mr. <HI>Glanville.</HI></P>
<P>Certainly, Sir, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> and in this I
am justified by all the Heroines of Antiquity.</P>
<P>Then you must be in the Right, Madam, re∣turned
Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> both because your own
Judgment tells you so, and also the Example
of these Heroines you mention.</P>
<P>Well, Madam, interrupted Miss <HI>Glanville</HI>
hastily, since my Brother has given Sentence on
your Side, I hope you will not delay your Visit
to Sir <HI>George</HI> any longer.</P>
<P>How! said Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> surprised, is Lady
<HI>Bella</HI> going to visit Sir <HI>George?</HI> Pray, Madam,
may I presume to-inquire the Reason for your
doing him this extraordinary Favour?</P>
<P>You are not very wise, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> looking
gravely upon Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> to discover a
Thing, which may haply create a Quarrel be∣tween
your Brother, and the unfortunate Per∣son
you speak of: Yet since this Indiscretion
cannot be recalled, we must endeavour to pre∣vent
the Consequences of it.</P>
<P>I assure you, Madam, interrupted Mr. <HI>Glan∣ville,</HI>
extremely impatient to know the Mean∣ing
of these Hints, you have nothing to fear
from me: Therefore you need not think your∣self
under any Necessity of concealing this Affair
from me.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="16"/>
You are not, haply, so moderate as you pre∣tend,
said <HI>Arabella,</HI> (who would not have been
displeased to have seen him in all the jealous
Transports of an enraged <HI>Orontes);</HI> but what∣ever
ensues, I can no longer keep from your
Knowledge, a Truth your Sister has begun to
discover; but, in telling you what you desire to
know, I expect you will suppress all Inclina∣tions
to Revenge, and trust the Care of your In∣terest
to my Generosity.</P>
<P>You are to know then, that in the Person of
your Friend Sir <HI>George,</HI> you have a Rival,
haply the more to be feared, as his Passion is
no less respectful than violent: I possibly tell
you more than I ought, pursued she, blushing,
and casting down her Eyes, when I confess,
that for certain Considerations, wherein perhaps
you are concerned, I have received the first In∣sinuation
of this Passion with Disdain enough;
and I assure myself, that you are too generous
to desire any Revenge upon a miserable Rival,
of whom Death is going to free you.</P>
<P>Then, taking Sir <HI>George</HI>'s Letter out of her
Cabinet, she presented it to Mr. <HI>Glanville.</HI></P>
<P>Read this, added she; but read it without
suffering yourself to be transported with any
violent Motions of Anger: And as in Fight, I
am persuaded you would not oppress a fallen
and vanquished Foe; so in Love, I may hope,
an unfortunate Rival will merit your Com∣passion.</P>
<P>Never doubt it, Madam, replied Mr. <HI>Glan∣ville,</HI>
receiving the Letter, which Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI>
with a beating Heart, earnestly desired to hear
read. Her Brother, after asking Permission of
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
<HI>Arabella,</HI> prepared to gratify her Curiosity; but
he no sooner read the first Sentence, than,
notwithstanding all his Endeavours, a Smile ap∣peared
in his Face; and Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> less able,
and indeed less concerned to restrain her Mirth
at the uncommon Stile, burst out a laughing,
with so much Violence, as obliged her Brother
to stop, and counterfeit a terrible Fit of Cough∣ing,
in order to avoid giving <HI>Arabella</HI> the like
Offence.</P>
<P>The Astonishment of this Lady, at the sur∣prising
and unexpected Effect her Lover's Let∣ter
produced on Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> kept her in a
profound Silence, her Eyes wandering from the
Sister to the Brother; who, continuing his
Cough, was not able, for some Moments, to
go on with his Reading.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> during this Interval, having reco∣vered
herself a little, asked Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> if
she found any thing in a Lover's Despair,
capable of diverting her so much, as she seemed
to be with that of the unfortunate Sir <HI>George?</HI></P>
<P>My Sister, Madam, said Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI>
preventing her Reply, knows so many of Sir
<HI>George</HI>'s Infidelities, that she cannot persuade
herself he is really in such a dangerous Way
as he insinuates: Therefore you ought not to be
surprised, if she is rather disposed to laugh at
this Epistle, than to be moved with any Con∣cern
for the Writer, who, though he is my Ri∣val,
I must say, appears to be in a deplorable
Condition.</P>
<P>Pray, Sir, resumed <HI>Arabella,</HI> a little compo∣sed
by those Words, finish the Letter: Your
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
Sister may possibly find more Cause for Pity
than Contempt, in the latter Part of it.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> giving a Look to his Sister,
sufficient to make her comprehend, that he
would have her restrain her Mirth for the future,
proceeded in his Reading; but every Line in∣creasing
his strong Inclination to laugh, when
he came to the pathetic Wish, that her fair
Eyes might shed some Tears upon his Tomb,
no longer able to keep his assumed Gravity,
he threw down the Letter in a counterfeited
Rage.</P>
<P>Curse the stupid Fellow! cried he, is he mad,
to call the finest Black Eyes in the Universe,
fair. Ah! Cousin, said he to <HI>Arabella,</HI> to must
be little acquainted with the Influence of your
Eyes, since he can so egregiously mistake their
Colour.</P>
<P>And it is very plain, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> that
you are little acquainted with the sublime Lan∣guage
in which he writes, since you find Fault
with an Epithet, which marks the Beauty, not
the Colour, of those Eyes he praises; for, in
fine, Fair is indifferently applied, as well to
Black and Brown Eyes, as to Light and Blue
ones, when they are either really lovely in
themselves, or by the Lover's Imagination
created so: And therefore, since Sir <HI>George</HI>'s
Prepossession has made him see Charms in my
Eyes, which questionless are not there; by
calling them fair, he has very happily expressed
himself, since therein he has the Sanction of
those great Historians, who wrote the Histories
of Lovers he seems to imitate, as well in his
Actions as Stile.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="19"/>
I find my Rival is very happy in your Opi∣nion,
Madam, said Mr. <HI>Glanville;</HI> and I am
apt to believe, I shall have more Reason to
envy than pity his Situation.</P>
<P>If you keep within the Bounds I prescribe
you, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> you shall have no Rea∣son
to envy his Situation; but, considering the
Condition to which his Despair has by this Time
certainly reduced him, Humanity requires that
we should take some Care of him; and, to
shew you how great my Opinion of your Ge∣nerosity
is, I will even intreat you to accom∣pany
me in the Visit I am going to make him.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> being determined, if possible,
to prevent her exposing herself, affected to be
extremely moved at this Request; and, rising
from his Chair in great seeming Agitation, tra∣versed
the Room for some Moments, without
speaking a Word: Then suddenly stopping;</P>
<P>And can you, Madam, said he, looking
upon <HI>Arabella,</HI> suppose, that I will consent to
your visiting my Rival; and that I will be mean
enough to attend you myself to his House? Do
you think, that <HI>Orontes</HI> you have often re∣proached
me with, would act in such a
Manner?</P>
<P>I don't know how <HI>Orontes</HI> would have acted
in this Case, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> because it never
happened that such a Proof of his Submission
was ever desired of him; but, considering that
he was of a very fiery and jealous Disposition,
it is probable he might act as you do.</P>
<P>I always understood, Madam, said Mr. <HI>Glan∣ville,</HI>
that <HI>Orontes</HI> was a Favourite of yours,
but it seems I was mistaken.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="20"/>
You will be very unjust, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> to
draw any unfavourable Conclusion from what
I have said, to the Prejudice of that valiant
Prince, for whom I confess I have a great Es∣teem;
and truly whoever reflects upon the
great Actions he did in the Wars between the
<HI>Amazons</HI> and the fierce <HI>Naobarzanes</HI> King of
the <HI>Cilicians,</HI> must needs conceive a very high
Idea of his Virtue; but if I cannot bring the
Example of <HI>Orontes</HI> to influence you in the pre∣sent
Case, I can mention those of other Per∣sons,
no less illustrious for their Birth and Cou∣rage,
than him. Did not the brave <HI>Memnon,</HI>
when his Rival <HI>Oxyatres</HI> was sick, intreat the
beautiful <HI>Barsina</HI> to favour him with a Visit?
And the complaisant Husband of the divine <HI>Pa∣risatis</HI>
was not contented with barely desiring
her to visit <HI>Lysimachus,</HI> who was dying with
Despair at her Marriage, but would many
times bring her himself to the Bed-side of this
unfortunate Lover, and, leaving her there, give
him an Opportunity of telling her what he
suffered for her sake.</P>
<P>I am afraid, Madam, said Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> I
shall never be capable of imitating either the
brave <HI>Memnon,</HI> nor the complaisant <HI>Lysimachus,</HI>
in this Case, and the Humour of <HI>Orontes</HI> seems
to me the most commendable.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> the Humour of
<HI>Orontes</HI> cost him an infinite Number of Pains;
and it may happen, you will as near resemble
him in his Fortune as you do in his Disposition:
But pray let us end this Dispute at present.
If you are not generous enough to visit an un∣fortunate
Rival, you shall not put a Stop to
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
the Charity of my Intentions; and since Miss
<HI>Glanville</HI> is all of a sudden become so severe,
that she will not accompany me in this Visit,
I shall be contented with the Attendance of
my Women.</P>
<P>Saying this, she rose from her Seat, calling
<HI>Lucy,</HI> and ordered her to bid her Companions
attend.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> seeing her thus determined,
was almost mad with Vexation.</P>
<P>Upon my Soul, Madam, said he, feizing
her Hand, you must not go.</P>
<P>How, Sir! said <HI>Arabella,</HI> sternly.</P>
<P>Not without seeing me die first, resumed he,
in a languishing Tone.</P>
<P>You must not die, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> a little
softened, nor must you pretend to hinder me
from going.</P>
<P>Nay, Madam, said <HI>Glanville,</HI> one of these
two Things will certainly happen: Either you
must resolve not to visit Sir <HI>George,</HI> or else be
contented to see me die at your Feet.</P>
<P>Was ever any Lady in so cruel a Dilemma?
said <HI>Arabella,</HI> throwing herself into the Chair
in a languishing Posture: What can I do to
prevent the Fate of two Persons, one of whom
I infinitely pity, and the other, obstinate as he
is, I cannot hate? Shall I resolve to let the
miserable <HI>Bellmour</HI> die, rather than grant him a
Favour the most rigid Virtue would not re∣fuse
him? or shall I, by opposing the impetuous
Humour of a Lover, to whom I am some∣what
obliged, make myself the Author of his
Death? Fatal Necessity! which obliges me
either to be cruel or unjust; and, with a Dispo∣sition
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
to neither, makes me, in some Degree,
guilty of both!</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which our Heroine is in some little
Confusion.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHILE <HI>Arabella</HI> was uttering this pa∣thetic
Complaint, Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> with
great Difficulty, kept himself from smiling;
and, by some supplicating Looks to his Sister,
prevented her laughing out; yet she gigled in
secret behind her Fan: But <HI>Arabella</HI> was so lost
in her melancholy Reflections, that she kept
her Eyes immoveably fixed on the Ground for
some Moments: At last, casting an upbraiding
Glance at <HI>Glanville;</HI></P>
<P>Is it possible, cruel Person that you are !
said she to him, that you can, without Pity,
see me suffer so much Uneasiness; and, knowing
the Sensibility of my Temper, can expose me
to the Grief of being accessary to the Death of
an unfortunate Man, guilty indeed of a too
violent Passion, which merits a gentler Punish∣ment,
than that you doom him to?</P>
<P>Don't be uneasy, dear Cousin, interrupted
Miss <HI>Glanville;</HI> I dare assure you Sir <HI>George</HI>
won't die.</P>
<P>It is impossible to think that, said <HI>Arabella,</HI>
since he has not so much as received a Com∣mand
from me to live; but tell me truly, pur∣sued
she, do you believe it probable, that he will
obey me, and live?</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="23"/>
Indeed, Madam, said Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> I could
swear for him that he will.</P>
<P>Well, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> I will content myself
with sending him my Commands in Writing;
but it is to be feared they will not have so much
Efficacy upon his Spirit.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> extremely pleased that she
had laid aside her Design of visiting Sir <HI>George,</HI>
did not oppose her writing to him, though he
was plotting how to prevent the Letter reaching
his Hands; and while she went into her Closet
to write, he conferred with his Sister upon the
Means he should use, expressing, at the same
time, great Resentment against Sir <HI>George,</HI>
for endeavouring to supplant him in his Cousin's
Affection.</P>
<P>What then, said Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> do you
really imagine Sir <HI>George</HI> is in Love with Lady
<HI>Bella?</HI></P>
<P>He is either in Love with her Person or
Estate, replied Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> or perhaps with
both; for she is handsome enough to gain a
Lover of his Merit, though she had no For∣tune;
and she has Fortune enough to do it,
though she had no Beauty.</P>
<P>My Cousin is well enough, to be sure, said
Miss <HI>Glanville;</HI> but I never could think her a
Beauty.</P>
<P>If, replied Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> a most lovely
Complection, regular Features, a fine Stature,
an elegant Shape, and an inexpressible Grace
in all her Motions, can form a Beauty, Lady
<HI>Bella</HI> may pretend to that Character, without
any Dispute.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="24"/>
Though she was all that you say, returned
Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> I am certain Sir <HI>George</HI> is not
in Love with her.</P>
<P>I wish I was certain of that, replied Mr.
<HI>Glanville;</HI> for 'tis very probable you are mis∣taken.</P>
<P>You may see by his Letter, interrupted Miss
<HI>Glanville,</HI> what a Jest he makes of her; and
if you had heard how he talked to her the other
Day in the Garden, you would have died with
Laughing; yet my poor Cousin thought he was
very serious, and was so foolishly pleased!</P>
<P>I assure you <HI>Charlotte,</HI> said Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI>
gravely, I shall take it very ill, if you make so
free with your Cousin's little Foibles; and if
Sir <HI>George</HI> presumes to make a Jest of her, as
you say, I shall teach him better Manners.</P>
<P>You are the strangest Creature in the World!
said Miss <HI>Glanville:</HI> A Minute or two ago, you
was wishing to be sure he was not in Love with
her; and now you are angry, when I assure
you he is only in Jest.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> that Moment coming out of her
Closet, broke off their Discourse. I have
written to Sir <HI>George,</HI> said she, addressing herself
to Mr. <HI>Glanville;</HI> and you are at Liberty, if
you please, to read my Letter, which I pro∣pose
to send away immediately.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> taking the Letter out of her
Hand, with a low Bow, began to read it to
himself; but <HI>Arabella,</HI> willing his Sister should
also be acquainted with the Contents, obliged
him, much against his Will, to read it aloud.
It was as follows:</P>

<P>WHATEVER Offence your presump∣tuous
Declaration may have given me,
yet my Resentment will be appeased with a
less Punishment than Death: And that
Grief and Submission you have testified in your
Letter, may haply have already procured you
Pardon for your Fault, provided you do not
forfeit it by Disobedience.</P>
<P>I therefore command you to live, and com∣mand
you by all that Power you have given me
over you.</P>
<P>Remember I require no more of you, than
<HI>Parisatis</HI> did of <HI>Lysimachus,</HI> in a more cruel
and insupportable Misfortune: Imitate then
the Obedience and Submission of that illustrious
Prince; and tho' you should be as unfortunate
as he, let your Courage also be equal to his;
and, like him, be contented with the Esteem
that is offered you, since it is all that can be
bestowed, by</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> finding by this Epistle, that
<HI>Arabella</HI> did not design to encourage the Ad∣dresses
of Sir <HI>George,</HI> would not have been
against his receiving it, had he not feared the
Consequence of his having such a convincing
Proof of the Peculiarity of her Temper in his
Possession; and while he kept the Letter in his
Hand, as if he wanted to consider it a little
better, he meditated on the Means to prevent
its being ever delivered; and had possibly fixed
upon some successful Contrivance, when a
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
Servant coming in, to inform the Ladies, that
Sir <HI>George</HI> was come to wait on them, put an
End to his Schemes; and he immediately ran
down to receive him, not being willing to in∣crease,
by his Stay, the Astonishment and Con∣fusion,
which appeared in the Countenance of
<HI>Arabella,</HI> at hearing a Man, whom she had
believed and represented to be dying, was
come to pay her a Visit.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Where the Lady extricates herself out of
her former Confusion, to the great Asto∣nishment,
we will suppose, of the Rea∣der.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MISS <HI>Glanville,</HI> not having so much De∣licacy
as her Brother, could not help
exulting a little upon this Occasion.</P>
<P>After the terrible Fright you have been in,
Madam, said she, upon Sir <HI>George</HI>'s Account,
I wonder you do not rather think it is his
Ghost than himself, that is come to see us.</P>
<P>There is no Question, but it is himself that
is come, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> (who had already recon∣ciled
this Visit, to her first Thoughts of him;)
and it is, haply, to execute his fatal Design in
my Presence, that has brought him here; and,
like the unfortunate <HI>Agilmond,</HI> he means to
convince me of his Fidelity and Love, by fall∣ing
upon his Sword before my Eyes.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="27"/>
Bless me, Madam, said Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> what
horrid Things come into your Head! I vow,
you terrify me out of my Wits, to hear you.</P>
<P>There is no Occasion for your Fears, in∣terrupted
<HI>Arabella:</HI> Since we already suspect his
Designs, it will be very easy to prevent them:
Had the Princess of the <HI>Sarmatians</HI> known the
fatal Intentions of her despairing Lover, doubt∣less,
she would have used some Precautions to
hinder him from executing them; for want of
which, she saw the miserable <HI>Agilmond</HI> wel∣tering
in his Blood at her Feet; and with Rea∣son
accused herself of being the Cause of so
deplorable a Spectacle.</P>
<P>The Astonishment Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> was in, to
hear her Cousin talk in this Manner, kept her
from giving her any Interruption, while she re∣lated
several other terrible Instances of Despair.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Sir <HI>George,</HI> who was im∣patient
to go up to Lady <HI>Bella</HI>'s Apartment,
having flattered himself with an Hope, that his
Letter was favourably received; and that he
should be permitted to <HI>hope</HI> at least; made a
short Visit to Sir <HI>Charles</HI> in his own Room; and,
accompanied by Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who was resolv∣ed
to see in what manner <HI>Arabella</HI> received
him, went to her Apartment.</P>
<P>As he had taken care, at his Entrance, to
accommodate his Looks to the Character he
had assumed of an humble despairing Lover,
<HI>Arabella</HI> no sooner saw him, but her Counte∣nance
changed; and, making a Sign to Mr.
<HI>Glanville,</HI> who could not comprehend what
she meant, to seize upon the Guard of his
Sword, she hastily stept forward to meet him.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="28"/>
I am too well convinced, said she to Sir
<HI>George,</HI> that the Intent of your coming hither
To day, is to commit some Violence against
yourself before my Eyes: But listen not, I be∣seech
you, to the Dictates of your Despair:
Live; I command you, live; and since you say,
I have the absolute Disposal of your Life, do
not deprive yourself of it, without the Consent
of her, on whom you profess to have bestowed
it.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George,</HI> who did not imagine <HI>Arabella</HI>
would communicate his Letter to her Cousins,
and only expected some distant Hints from her
concerning it, was so confounded at this Re∣ception
before them, that he was not able to
reply: He blushed, and turned pale alternately;
and, not daring to look, either upon Miss <HI>Glan∣ville,</HI>
or her Brother, or to meet the Eyes of the
fair Visionary, who, with great Impatience, ex∣pected
his Answer, he hung down his Head
in a very silly Posture; and, by his Silence, con∣firmed
<HI>Arabella</HI> in her Opinion.</P>
<P>As he did not want for Wit and Assurance,
during that Interval of Silence, and Expecta∣tion
from all Parties; his Imagination suggested
to him the Means of extricating himself out of
the ridiculous Perplexity he was in; and as it
concerned him greatly to avoid any Quarrel,
with the Brother and Sister, he determined to
turn the whole Matter into a Jest; but, if pos∣sible,
to manage it so, that <HI>Arabella</HI> should not
enter into his Meaning.</P>
<P>Raising therefore his Eyes, and looking upon
<HI>Arabella</HI> with a melancholy Air;</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="29"/>
You are not deceived, Madam, said he: This
Criminal, with whom you are so justly offend∣ed,
comes with an Intention to die at your
Feet, and breathe out his miserable Life, to ex∣piate
those Crimes of which you accuse him:
But since your severe Compassion will oblige
me to live, I obey, oh! most divine, but cruel
<HI>Arabella!</HI> I obey your harsh Commands; and,
by endeavouring to live, give you a more con∣vincing
Proof of that Respect and Submission
I shall always have for your Will.</P>
<P>I expected no less from your Courage and
Generosity, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> with a Look of great
Complacency; and since you so well know
how to imitate the great <HI>Lysimachus</HI> in your
Obedience, I shall not be less acknowleging
then the fair <HI>Parisatis;</HI> but will have for you
an Esteem equal to that Virtue I have ob∣served
in you.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George,</HI> having received this gracious Pro∣mise,
with a most profound Bow, turned to
Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> with a kind of chastened Smile
upon his Countenance.</P>
<P>And, you, fortunate and deserving Knight,
said he, happy in the Affections of the fairest
Person in the World! grudge me not this small
Alleviation of my Misfortunes; and envy me
not that Esteem, which alone is able to make
me suffer Life, while you possess, in the Heart
of the divine <HI>Arabella,</HI> a Felicity that might
be envied by the greatest Monarchs in the
World.</P>
<P>As diverting as this Scene was, Mr. <HI>Glan∣ville</HI>
was extremely uneasy: For though Sir
<HI>George</HI>'s Stratagem took, and he believed he
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
was only indulging the Gaiety of his Humour,
by carrying on this Farce; yet he could not
endure, he should divert himself at <HI>Arabella</HI>'s
Expence. The solemn Speech he had made him,
did indeed force him to smile; but he soon as∣sumed
a graver Look, and told Sir <HI>George,</HI> in
a low Voice, that when he had finished his
Visit, he should be glad to take a Turn with
him in the Garden.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George</HI> promised to follow him, and Mr.
<HI>Glanville</HI> left the Room, and went into the
Gardens; where the Baronet, having taken a
respectful Leave of <HI>Arabella,</HI> and, by a sly
Glance, convinced Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> he had sa∣crificed
her Cousin to her Mirth, went to join
her Brother.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> as soon as he saw him, walk∣ed
to meet him with a very reserved Air: Which
Sir <HI>George</HI> observing, and being resolved to keep
up his Humour;</P>
<P>What, inhuman, but too happy Lover, said
he, what, am I to understand by that Cloud
upon your Brow? Is it possible, that thou
canst envy me the small Comfort I have re∣ceived;
and, not satisfied with the glorious
Advantages thou possessest, wilt thou still deny
me that Esteem, which the divine <HI>Arabella</HI>
has been pleased to bestow upon me?</P>
<P>Pray, Sir <HI>George,</HI> said Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> lay
aside this pompous Style: I am not disposed to
be merry at present, and have not all the Re∣lish
for this kind of Wit, that you seem to ex∣pect.
I desired to see you here, that I might
tell you without Witnesses, I take it extreme∣ly
ill, you should presume to make my Cousin
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>
the Object of your Mirth. Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> Sir,
is not a Person, with whom such Liberties
ought to be taken; nor will I, in the double
Character of her Lover and Relation, suffer it
from any one whatever.</P>
<P>Cruel Fortune! said Sir <HI>George,</HI> stepping back
a little, and lifting up his Eyes, shall I al∣ways
be exposed to thy Persecutions? And
must I, without any apparent Cause, behold
an Enemy in the Person of my Friend; who,
though, without murmuring, I resign to him
the adorable <HI>Arabella,</HI> is yet resolved to dis∣pute
with me, a Satisfaction, which does not
deprive him of any Part of that glorious For∣tune
to which he is destined? Since it is so,
unjust and cruel Friend, pursued he, strike
this Breast, which carries the Image of the
divine <HI>Arabella;</HI> but think not, that I will offer
to defend myself, or lift my Sword, against a
Man beloved by her.</P>
<P>This is all very fine, returned Mr. <HI>Glan∣ville,</HI>
hardly able to forbear laughing; but 'tis
impossible, with all your Gaiety, to hinder me
from being serious upon this Business.</P>
<P>Then be as serious as thou wilt, dear <HI>Charles,</HI>
interrupted Sir <HI>George,</HI> provided you will allow
me to be gay; and not pretend to infect me
with thy unbecoming Gravity.</P>
<P>I have but a few Words to say to you, then,
Sir, replied Mr. <HI>Glanville:</HI> Either behave with
more Respect to my Cousin; or prepare to
give me Satisfaction, for the Insults you offer
her.</P>
<P>Oh! I understand you, Sir, said Sir <HI>George;</HI>
and because you have taken it into your Head
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>
to be offended at a Trifle of no Consequence in
the World, I must give you a fair Chance to
run me through the Body! There is something
very foolish, saith, in such an extravagant Ex∣pectation:
But since Custom has made it ne∣cessary,
that a Man must venture his Soul and
Body upon these important Occasions; because
I will not be out of the Fashion, you shall com∣mand
me whenever you think sit; though I
shall fight with my Schoolfellow with a very
ill Will, I assure you.</P>
<P>There is no Necessity for fighting, said Mr.
<HI>Glanville,</HI> blushing at the ludicrous Light, in
which the gay Baronet had placed his Challenge:
The Concession I have required, is very small,
and not worth the contesting for, on your Side.
Lady <HI>Beila</HI>'s Peculiarity, to which you contri∣bute
so much, can afford you, at best, but an
ill-natured Diversion, while it gives me a real
Pain; and sure, you must acknowlege, you
are doing me a very great Injury, when you
endeavour to confirm a Lady, who is to be my
Wife, in a Behaivour that excites your Mirth,
and makes her a fit Object for your Ridicule,
and Contempt.</P>
<P>You do Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> a mnch greater Injury
than I do, replied Sir <HI>George,</HI> by supposing,
she can ever be an Object of Ridicule and Con∣tempt:
I think very highly of her Understand∣ing;
and though the Bent of her Studies has
given her Mind a romantic Turn, yet the
Singularity of her Manners is far less disagree∣able,
than the lighter Follies of most of her
Sex.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="33"/>
But to be absolutely perfect, interrupted Mr.
<HI>Glanville,</HI> I must cure her of that Singularity;
and therefore I beg you will not persist in as∣suming
a Behaviour conformable to her ro∣mantic
Ideas; but rather help me to banish them
from her Imagination.</P>
<P>Well, replied Sir <HI>George,</HI> since you no longer
threaten, I'll do what I can to content you; but
I must quit my Heroics by Degrees, and sink
with Decency into my own Character; other∣wise
she will never endure me in her Presence.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> and Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> appearing in
the Walk, broke off the Conversation. The
Baronet and Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> walked forward to
meet them; but <HI>Arabella,</HI> who did not desire
Company, struck into another Walk, whi∣ther
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> following, proposed to join
her; when he saw his Father, who had been
taking a Turn there alone, make up to <HI>Ara∣bella;</HI>
and, supposing he would take that Op¦portunity
to talk to her concerning him, he
went back to his Sister and Sir <HI>George,</HI> whose
Conversation he interrupted, to the great Regret
of Miss <HI>Glanville.</HI></P>

<P>In which will be found one of the former
Mistakes pursued, and another cleared

Persons; among whom, the Reader, we

</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>ARABELLA</HI> no sooner saw Sir <HI>Charles</HI>
advancing towards her, when, sensible of
the Consequence of being alone with a Per∣son
whom she did not doubt, would make use
of that Advantage, to talk to her of Love, she
endeavoured to avoid him, but in vain; for Sir
<HI>Charles,</HI> guessing her Intentions, walked hastily
up to her; and, taking hold of her Hand,</P>
<P>You must not go away, Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> said he:
I have something to say to you.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> extremely discomposed at this Be∣haviour,
struggled to free her Hand from her
Uncle; and, giving him a Look, on which Dis∣dain
and Fear were visibly painted,</P>
<P>Unhand me, Sir, said she, and force me not
to forget the Respect I owe you, as my Uncle,
by treating you with a Severity such uncom∣mon
Insolence demands.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> letting go her Hand in a great
Surprize, at the Word Insolent, which she had
used, asked her, If she knew to whom she was
speaking?</P>
<P>Questionless, I am speaking to my Uncle,
replied she; and 'tis with great Regret I see
myself obliged to make use of Expressions no
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>
way conformable to the Respect I bear that
sacred Character.</P>
<P>And, pray, Madam, said Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> some∣what
softened by this Speech, who is it that
obliges you to lay aside that Respect you seem
to acknowlege is due to your Uncle?</P>
<P>You do, Sir, replied she; and 'tis with in∣finite
Sorrow, that I beheld you assuming a
Character unbecoming the Brother of my Fa∣ther.</P>
<P>This is pretty plain, indeed, interrupted Sir
<HI>Charles:</HI> But pray, Madam, inform me, what
it is you complain of.</P>
<P>You, questionless, know much better than I
can tell you, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> blushing, the
Offence I accuse you of; nor is it proper for
me to mention, what it would not become me
to suffer.</P>
<P>Zounds! cried Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> no longer able
to suppress his growing Anger, this is enough
to make a Man mad.</P>
<P>Ah! I beseech you, Sir, resumed <HI>Arabella,</HI>
suffer not an unfortunate and ill-judged Pas∣sion
to be the Bane of all your Happiness and
Virtue: Recall your wandring Thoughts; re∣flect
upon the Dishonour you will bring upon
yourself, by persisting in such unjustifiable Sen∣timents.</P>
<P>I do not know how it is possible to avoid it,
said Sir <HI>Charles;</HI> and, notwithstanding all this
fine Reasoning, there are few People but would
fly into greater Extremities; but my Affection
for you makes me.—</P>
<P>Hold, hold, I conjure you, Sir, interrupted
<HI>Arabella;</HI> force me not to listen to such injurious
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
Language; carry that odious Affection some∣where
else; and do not persecute an unfortu∣nate
Maid, who has contributed nothing to thy
Fault, and is only guilty of too much Com∣passion
for thy Weakness.</P>
<P>Good God, cried Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> starting back,
and looking upon <HI>Arabella</HI> with Astonishment;
how I pity my Son! What would I not give, if
he did not love this Girl?</P>
<P>Think not, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> that the Passion
your Son has for me, makes your Condition a
bit the worse; for I would be such as I am,
with respect to you, were there no Mr. <HI>Glan∣ville</HI>
in the World.</P>
<P>I never thought, Niece, said Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> af∣ter
a little Pause, that any Part of my Beha∣viour,
could give you the Offence you com∣plain
of, or authorize that Hatred and Con∣tempt
you take the Liberty to express for me:
But since it is so, I promise you, I will quit
your House, and leave you to your self; I have
always been solicitous for your Welfare; and,
ungrateful as you are—</P>
<P>Call me not ungrateful, interrupted <HI>Ara∣bella</HI>
again: Heaven is my Witness, that had
you not forgot I was your Niece, I would have
always remembred you was my Uncle; and
not only have regarded you as such, but have
looked upon you as another Father, under
whose Direction Providence had placed me,
since it had deprived me of my real Father; and
whose Tenderness and Care, might have in
some measure supplied the Loss I had of him:
But Heaven has decreed it otherwise; and since
it is his Will, that I should be deprived of the
<PB N="35" REF="37"/>
Comfort and Assistance my Orphan State re∣quires,
I must submit, without murmuring, to
my Destiny. Go then, unfortunate and la∣mented
Uncle, pursued she, wiping some
Tears from her fine Eyes; go, and endeavour
by Reason and Absence to recover thy Re∣pose;
and be assured, whenever you can con∣vince
me you have triumphed over these Sen∣timents
which now cause both our Unhappiness,
you shall have no Cause to complain of my
Conduct towards you.</P>
<P>Finishing these Words, she left him with so
much Speed, that it would have been impos∣sible
for him to have stopped her, though he
had intended it: But indeed, he was so lost in
Wonder and Confusion at a Behaviour for
which he was not able to assign any other
Cause than Madness, that he remained fixed
in the same Posture of Surprize, in which she
had left him; and from which he was first in∣terrupted
by the Voice of his Son, who, see∣ing
<HI>Arabella</HI> flying towards the House in great
seeming Emotion, came to know the Result of
their Conversation.</P>
<P>Sir, said Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who had spoken to
his Father before, but had no Answer, will
you not inform me, what Success you have had
with my Cousin? How did she receive your
Proposal.</P>
<P>Speak of her no more, said Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> she
is a proud ungrateful Girl, and unworthy the
Affection you have for her.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who trembled to hear so un∣favourable
an Answer to his Inquiries, was
struck dumb with his Surprize and Grief; when
<PB N="36" REF="38"/>
Sir <HI>Charles</HI> taking Notice of the Alteration in
his Countenance;</P>
<P>I am sorry, said he, to find you have set
your Heart upon this fantastic Girl: If ever
she be your Wife, which I very much doubt,
she will make you very unhappy: But, <HI>Charles,</HI>
pursued he, I would advise you to think no
more of her; content yourself with the Estate
you gain by her Refusal of you: With that Ad∣dition
to your own Fortune, you may pretend
to any Lady whatever; and you will find many
that are full as agreeable as your Cousin, who
will be proud of your Addresses.</P>
<P>Indeed, Sir, said Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> with a Sigh,
there is no Woman upon Earth whom I would
choose to marry, but Lady <HI>Bella:</HI> I flattered
myself, I had been happy enough to have made
some Progress in her Affection; but it seems, I
was mistaken; however, I should be glad to
know, if she gave you any Reasons for refusing
me.</P>
<P>Reasons! said Sir <HI>Charles:</HI> There is no mak∣ing
her hear Reason, or expecting Reason from
her; I never knew so strange a Woman in my
Life: She would not allow me to speak what
I intended concerning you; but interrupted me,
every Moment, with some high-flown Stuff or
other.</P>
<P>Then I have not lost all Hopes of her, cried
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> eagerly; for since she did not
hear what you had to say, she could not pos∣sibly
deny you.</P>
<P>But she behaved in a very impertinent Man∣ner
to me, interrupted Sir <HI>Charles;</HI> complained
of my harsh Treatment of her; and said seve∣ral
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>
other Things, which, because of her uncom∣mon
Style, I could not perfectly understand;
yet they seemed shocking; and, upon the Whole,
treated me so rudely, that I am determined to
leave her to herself, and trouble my Head no
more about her.</P>
<P>For God's sake, dear Sir, said Mr. <HI>Glan∣ville,</HI>
alarmed at this Resolution, suspend your
Anger, till I have seen my Cousin: There is
some Mistake, I am persuaded, in all this. I
know she has some very odd Humours, which
you are not so well acquainted with, as I am.
I'll go to her, and prevail upon her to explain
herself.</P>
<P>You may do so, if you please, replied Sir
<HI>Charles;</HI> but I fear it will be to very little Pur∣pose;
for I really suspect her Head is a little
turned: I do not know what to do with her:
It is not fit she should have the Management of
herself; and yet 'tis impossible to live upon easy
Terms with her.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who did not doubt but <HI>Ara∣bella</HI>
had been guilty of some very ridiculous
Folly, offered nothing more in her Justifica∣tion;
but, having attended his Father to his own
Chamber went to <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Apartment.</P>
<P>He found the pensive Fair-one, in a melan∣choly
Posture, her Head reclined upon one
of her fair Hands; and though her Eyes were
fixed upon a Book she held in the other, yet
she did not seem to read, but rather to be
wholly buried in Contemplation.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> having so happily found her
alone (for her Women were not then in her
Chamber) seated himself near her; having first
<PB N="38" REF="40"/>
asked Pardon for the Interruption he had given
to her Studies; and <HI>Arabella,</HI> throwing aside her
Book, prepared to listen to his Discourse;
which by the Agitation, which appeared in
Looks, she imagined, would be upon some
extraordinary Subject.</P>
<P>I left my Father just now, said he, in a
great deal of Uneasiness, on account of some∣thing
you said to him, Lady <HI>Bella:</HI> He ap∣prehends
you are disobliged, and he would
willingly know how.</P>
<P>Has your Father then acquainted you with
the Subject of our Conversation? interrupted
<HI>Arabella.</HI></P>
<P>I know what would have been the Subject of
your Conversation, replied Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> if
you had been pleased to listen to what Sir
<HI>Charles</HI> intended to say to you on my Be∣half.</P>
<P>On your Behalf? interrupted <HI>Arabella:</HI> Ah
poor deceived <HI>Glanville!</HI> how I pity thy blind
Sincerity! But it is not for me to undeceive
thee: Only thus much I must say to you, Beware
of committing your Interests to a Person, who
will be a much better Advocate for another
than for you.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> rejoiced to find by these
Words, that her Resentment against his Fa∣ther
was occasioned by a Suspicion so favour∣able
for him, assured her, that Sir <HI>Charles</HI>
wished for nothing more earnestly, than that he
might be able to merit her Esteem; and that
it was to dispose her to listen to his Addresses,
that he wanted to discourse with her that Morn∣ing.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="41"/>
Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> being obliged, through his
Knowlege of his Cousin's Temper, to speak
to her in this distant Manner, went on with
his Assurances of his Father's Candour in this
Respect; and <HI>Arabella,</HI> who would not de∣clare
her Reasons for doubting it, only replied,
That she wished Sir <HI>Charles</HI> meant all that he
had said to him; but that she could not per∣suade
herself to believe him sincere, till his fu∣ture
Actions had convinced her he was so.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> impatient to let his Father
know, how greatly he had been mistaken in
the Cause of <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Behaviour, made his
Visit shorter than he would otherwise have done,
in order to undeceive him.</P>
<P>It is possible, said Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> when his Son
had repeated the Conversation he had just had
with <HI>Arabella,</HI> that she could be so foolish, as
to imagine, I had a Design to propose any one
else to her but you? What Reason have I ever
given her, to think I would not be glad to
have her for my Daughter-in-law? Indeed,
she has some odd Ways that are very disagree∣able;
but she is one of the best Matches in
<HI>England</HI> for all that: Poor Girl! pursued he,
she had Reason to be angry, if that was the
Case; and now I remember, she cried, when
I told her I would leave the House; yet her
Spirit was so great, that she told me, I might
go. Well, I'll go and make it up with her;
but who could have imagined, she would have
been so foolish? Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> at the Repetition
of these Words, hurried away to <HI>Arabella</HI>'s
Apartment.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="42"/>
Niece, said he at his Entrance, I am come
to ask you Pardon, for having led you into a
Belief, that I meant—</P>
<P>'Tis enough, Sir, interrupted <HI>Arabella;</HI> I grant
you my Pardon for what is past; and as it does not
become me to receive Submissions from my
Uncle, while he remembers he is so, I will dis∣pense
with your Acknowlegements at present:
Only to convince me, that this sudden Altera∣tion
is sincere, avoid, I beseech you, for the fu∣ture,
all Occasions of displeasing me.</P>
<P>I protest, cried Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> that I never in∣tended—</P>
<P>I will not hear you say a Word more of your
past Intentions, interrupted <HI>Arabella</HI> again: I
have forgot them all; and, while you con∣tinue
to regard me as your Niece, I will ne∣ver
remember them to your Disadvantage.</P>
<P>Then I may hope, said Sir <HI>Charles</HI>—</P>
<P>Oh! Heavens! cried <HI>Arabella,</HI> not suffering
him to proceed; do you come to insult me
thus, with a mock Repentance? And has my
Easiness, in being so ready to forget the In∣jury
you would have done me, made you pre∣sumptuous
enough to cherish an insolent Hope
that I will ever change my Resolution?</P>
<P>How vexatious is this! replied Sir <HI>Charles,</HI>
fretting to see her continually mistaking him.
I swear to you, by all that is sacred, that 'tis
my Son, for whom I would solicit your Con∣sent.</P>
<P>How! said <HI>Arabella,</HI> astonished, Will you
then be just at last? And can you resolve to
plead for that Son, whose Interest, but a Mo∣ment
ago, you would have destroyed?</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="43"/>
I see, said Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> it is impossible to
convince you.</P>
<P>No, no interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> hastily; it is
not impossible but my own ardent Wishes that
it may be so, will help to convince me of the
Truth of what you say: For in fine, do you
think, I shall not be as glad as yourself, to find
you capable of acting honourably by your Son;
and to see myself no longer the Cause of the
most unjustifiable Conduct imaginable?</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles</HI> was opening his Mouth, to press
her in Favour of Mr. <HI>Glanville;</HI> whom, not∣withstanding
her strange Behaviour, he was
glad to find, she loved; when <HI>Arabella</HI> pre∣venting
him,</P>
<P>Seek not, I beseech you, said she, to de∣stroy
that Belief I am willing to give your
Words, by any more Attempts at this time
to persuade me; for truly, I shall interpret
your Solicitude no way in your Favour; there∣fore,
if you desire I should be convinced you
are sincere, let the Silence I require of you, be
one Proof of it.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> who looked excessively out of
Countenance at such a peremptory Command
from his Niece, was going out of her Cham∣ber
in a very ill Humour, when the Dinner∣bell
ringing, she gave him her Hand, with a
very gracions Air; and permitted him to lead
her into the Dining-room, where they found
Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> his Sister, and Sir <HI>George,</HI> who
had been detained to Dinner by Miss <HI>Glan∣ville,</HI>
expecting their coming.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Containing some Account of Thalestris,
Queen of the Amazons, with other
curious Anecdotes.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>LADY <HI>Bella</HI> having recovered her usual
Chearfulness, thro' the Satisfaction she
felt at her Uncle's returning to Reason, and
the Abatement she perceived in Sir <HI>George</HI>'s
extreme Melancholy, mixed in the Conversa∣tion
with that Wit and Vivacity which was
natural to her, and which so absolutely charmed
the whole Company, that not one of them re∣membred
any of her former Extravagancies.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> gazed on her with a passionate
Tenderness, Sir <HI>George</HI> with Admiration, and
the old Baronet with Wonder and Delight.</P>
<P>But Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> who was inwardly vexed
at the Superiority her Cousin's Wit gave her
over herself, wished for nothing more than an
Opportunity of interrupting a Conversation in
which she could have no Share; and, willing
to put them in mind of some of <HI>Arabella</HI>'s
strange Notions, when she observed them
disputing concerning some of the Actions of
the antient <HI>Romans,</HI> she very innocently asked
Sir <HI>George,</HI> Whether in former times Women
went to the Wars, and fought like Men? For
my Cousin, added she, talks of one <HI>Thaltris,</HI> a
Woman, that was as courageous as any Soldier
whatever.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="45"/>
Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> horridly vexed at a Question
that was likely to engage <HI>Arabella</HI> in a Discourse
very different from that she had been so capa∣ble
of pleasing in, frowned very intelligibly at
his Sister; and, to prevent any Answer being
given to her absurd Demand, directed some
other Conversation to <HI>Arabella:</HI> But she, who
saw a favourite Subject started, took no Notice
of what Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> was saying to her; but,
directing her Looks to Sir <HI>George,</HI></P>
<P>Though Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> said she, be a little
mistaken in the Name of that fair Queen she
has mentioned; yet I am persuaded you know
whom she means; and that it is the renowned
<HI>Thalestris,</HI> whose Valour staggers her Belief,
and of whom she wants to be informed.</P>
<P>Ay, ay, <HI>Thalestris,</HI> said Miss <HI>Glanville:</HI> It
is such a strange Name I could not remember
it; but, pray, was there ever such a Person?</P>
<P>Certainly, Madam, there was, replied Sir
<HI>George:</HI> She was Queen of the <HI>Amazons,</HI> a war∣like
Nation of Women, who possessed great
Part of <HI>Cappadocia,</HI> and extended their Con∣quests
so far, that they became formidable to
all their Neighbours.</P>
<P>You find, Miss, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> I did not at∣tempt
to impose upon you, when I told you
of the admirable Valour of that beautiful
Queen; which indeed was so great, that the
united Princes, in whose Cause she fought,
looked upon her Assistance to be equal to that
of a whole Army; and they honoured her,
accordingly, with the most distinguishing Marks
of their Esteem and Acknowlegement, and
offered her the chief Command of their Forces.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="46"/>
O shameful! cried Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> offer a
Woman the Command of an Army! Brave
Fellows indeed, that would be commanded by
a Woman! Sure your mistake, Niece; there
never was such a thing heard of in the World.</P>
<P>What, Sir, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> will you contradict
a Fact attested by the greatest Historians that
ever were? You may as well pretend to say,
there never were such Persons as <HI>Oroondates</HI> or
<HI>Juba,</HI> as dispute the Existence of the famous
<HI>Thalestris.</HI></P>
<P>Why, pray, Madam, said Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> who
were those?</P>
<P>One of them, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> was the
great King of <HI>Scythia;</HI> and the other, Prince
of the Two <HI>Mauritanias.</HI></P>
<P>Ods-heart! interrupted Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> I believe
their Kingdoms are in the Moon: I never heard
of <HI>Scythia,</HI> or the Two <HI>Mauritanias,</HI> before.</P>
<P>And yet, Sir, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> those King∣doms
are doubtless as well known, as <HI>France</HI>
or <HI>England;</HI> and there is no Question, but the
Descendants of the great <HI>Oroondates,</HI> and the
valiant <HI>Juba,</HI> sway the Sceptres of them to this
Day.</P>
<P>I must confess, said Sir <HI>George,</HI> I have a
very great Admiration for those Two renowned
Princes, and have read their beautiful Exploits
with infinite Pleasure; notwithstanding which,
I am more inclined to esteem the great <HI>Arta∣ban,</HI>
then either of them.</P>
<P>Though <HI>Artaban,</HI> replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> is without
Question, a Warrior equal to either of them,
and haply no Person in the World possessed so
sublime a Courage as his was; yet, it may be,
<PB N="45" REF="47"/>
your Partiality proceeds from another Cause;
and you having the Honour to resemble him in
some little Infidelities he was accused of, with
less Justice than yourself perhaps, induces you
to favour him more than any other.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> blushed when she ended these
Words: And Sir <HI>George</HI> replied, with a Sigh;</P>
<P>I have, indeed, the Honour, Madam, to re∣semble
the great <HI>Artaban,</HI> in having dared to
raise my Thoughts towards a Divine Person,
who, with Reason, condemns my Adorations.</P>
<P>Hey-day! cried Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> are you going
to speak of Divine Things, after all the Fables
you have been talking of? Troth, I love to
hear young Men enter upon such Subjects: But
pray, Niece, who told you Sir <HI>George</HI> was an
Infidel?</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> replied <HI>Arabella:</HI> And I am
inclined to think he spoke Truth; for Sir
<HI>George</HI> has never pretended to deny it.</P>
<P>How! interrupted Sir <HI>Charles;</HI> I am sorry
to hear that. I hope you have never, added
he, looking at the young Baronet, endea∣voured
to corrupt my Son with any of your
Free-thinking Principles: I am for every
body having Liberty of Conscience; but I
cannot endure to hear People of your Stamp
endeavouring to propagate your mischievous
Notions; and because you have no Regard for
your own future Happiness, disturbing other
People in the laudable Pursuit of theirs.</P>
<P>We will not absolutely condemn Sir <HI>George,</HI>
said <HI>Arabella,</HI> till we have heard his History
from his own Mouth, which he promised, some
time ago, to relate when I desired it.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="48"/>
I do not imagine his History is fit to be heard
by Ladies, said Sir <HI>Charles;</HI> for your Infidels
live a strange kind of Life.</P>
<P>However that may be, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> we
must not dispense with Sir <HI>George</HI> from per∣forming
his Promise: I dare say there are no
Ladies here, who will think the worse of him
for freely confessing his Faults.</P>
<P>You may answer for yourself, if you please,
Madam, said Sir <HI>Charles;</HI> but I hope my Girl
there, will not say as much.</P>
<P>I dare say my Cousin is not so rigid, said
<HI>Arabella:</HI> She has too much the Spirit of <HI>Ju∣lia</HI>
in her, to find Fault with a little Infidelity.</P>
<P>I am always obliged to you for your Com∣parisons,
Cousin, said Miss <HI>Glanville:</HI> I sup∣pose
this is greatly to my Advantage too.</P>
<P>I assure you, Madam, said Sir <HI>George,</HI> Lady
<HI>Bella</HI> has done you no Injury by the Compari∣son
she has just now made; for <HI>Julia</HI> was one
of the finest Princesses in the World.</P>
<P>Yet she was not free from the Suspicion of
Infidelity, replied <HI>Arabella;</HI> but though I do
not pretend to tax my Cousin with that Fault,
yet it is with a great deal of Reason that I say
she resembles her in her volatile Humour.</P>
<P>I was never thought to be ill-humoured in
my Life, Madam, said Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> co∣louring;
and I cannot imagine what Reason I
have given you for saying I am.</P>
<P>Nay, Cousin, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> I am not con∣demning
your Humour; for, to say the Truth,
there are a great many Charms in a volatile
Disposition; and, notwithstanding the admirable
Beauty of <HI>Julia,</HI> it is possible she made as
<PB N="47" REF="49"/>
many Slaves by her light and airy Carriage, as
she did by her Eyes, though they were the
fairest in the World, except the divine <HI>Cleo∣patra</HI>'s.</P>
<P><HI>Cleopatra!</HI> cried Sir <HI>Charles:</HI> Why she was
a Gypsey, was she not?</P>
<P>I never heard her called so, said <HI>Arabella,</HI>
gravely; and I am apt to believe you are not at
all acquainted with her: But pray, pursued she,
let us wave this Discourse at present, and pre∣pare
to listen to Sir <HI>George</HI>'s Relation of his
Life; which, I dare say, is full of very extra∣ordinary
Events: However, Sir, added she, di∣recting
her Speech to the young Baronet, I am
afraid your Modesty will induce you to speak
with less Candour than you ought, of those
great Actions, which questionless you have per∣formed:
Therefore we shall hear your History,
with greater Satisfaction, from the Mouth of
your faithful 'Squire, who will not have the
same Reasons that you have, for suppressing
what is most admirable in the Adventures of
your Life.</P>
<P>Since it is your Pleasure, Madam, replied
Sir <HI>George,</HI> to hear my Adventures, I will re∣count
them as well as I am able my self, to
the end that I may have an Opportunity of
obliging you by doing some Violence to my na∣tural
Modesty, which will not suffer me to re∣late
Things the World have been pleased to
speak of to my Advantage, without some little
Confusion.</P>
<P>Then, casting down his Eyes, he seemed to
be recollecting the most material Passages in his
Life. Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> though he could have
<PB N="48" REF="50"/>
wished he had not indulged <HI>Arabella</HI> in her ridi∣culous
Request, was not able to deny himself
the Diversion of hearing what Kind of History
he would invent; and therefore resolved to stay
and listen to him.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> was also highly delighted with
the Proposal; but Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> who could not
conceive there could be any thing worth
listening to, in a young Rake's Account of
himself, got up with an Intention to walk in
the Garden; when, perceiving it rained, he
changed his Resolution, and, resuming his Seat,
prepared to listen, as every one else did, to the
expected Story.</P>
<P>When Sir <HI>George,</HI> after having paused a
Quarter of an Hour longer, during which all
the Company observed a profound Silence, be∣gan
his Relation in this Manner, addressing
himself to <HI>Arabella.</HI></P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Containing the Beginning of Sir George's
History; in which the ingenious Relater
has exactly copied the Stile of Romance.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HOUGH at present, Madam,
you behold me in the Quality of a
private Gentleman, in the Posses∣sion
only of a tolerable Estate;
yet my Birth is illustrious enough:
My Ancestors having formerly worn a Crown▪
which, as they won by their Valour, so they lost
by their Misfortune only.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="52"/>
How, interrupted Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> are you de∣scended
from Kings? Why, I never heard you
say so before: Pray, Sir, how far are you re∣moved
from Royal Blood? and which of your
Forefathers was it that wore a Crown?</P>
<P>Sir, replied Sir <HI>George,</HI> it is not much more
than Eight hundred Years since my Ancestors,
who were <HI>Saxons,</HI> swayed the Sceptre of <HI>Kent;</HI>
and from the first Monarch of that mighty
Kingdom, am I lineally descended.</P>
<P>Pray where may that Kingdom of <HI>Kent</HI> lie?
said Sir <HI>Charles.</HI></P>
<P>In—replied Sir <HI>George.</HI></P>
<P>A mighty Kingdom indeed! said Sir <HI>Charles:</HI>
Why, it makes but a very small Part of the King∣dom
of <HI>Britain</HI> now: Well, if your An∣cestors
were Kings of that County as it is now
called, it must be confessed their Dominions
were very small.</P>
<P>However that may be, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> it raises
Sir <HI>George</HI> greatly in my Esteem, to hear he is
descended from Kings; for, truly, a Royal Ex∣traction
does infinitely set off noble and valiant
Actions, and inspires only lofty and generous
Sentiments: Therefore, illustrious Prince (for
in that Light I shall always consider you), be
assured, though Fortune has despoiled you of
your Dominions, yet since she cannot deprive
you of your Courage and Virtue, Providence
will one Day assist your noble Endeavours to
recover your Rights, and place you upon the
Throne of your Ancestors, from whence you
have been so inhumanly driven: Or, haply, to
repair that Loss, your Valour may procure you
<PB N="51" REF="53"/>
other Kingdoms, no less considerable than that
to which you was born.</P>
<P>For Heaven's sake, Niece, said Sir <HI>Charles,</HI>
How come such improbable Things into your
Head? Is it such an easy Matter, think you, to
conquer Kingdoms, that you can flatter a young
Man, who has neither Fleets nor Armies, with
such strange Hopes?</P>
<P>The great <HI>Artaban,</HI> Sir, resumed <HI>Arabella,</HI>
had neither Fleets nor Armies, and was Master
only of a single Sword; yet he soon saw him∣self
greater than any King, disposing the De∣stinies
of Monarchs by his Will, and deciding
the Fates of Empires by a single Word: But
pray let this Dispute rest where it is, and per∣mit
Sir <HI>George</HI> to continue his Relation.</P>
<P>It is not necessary, Madam, resumed Sir
<HI>George,</HI> to acquaint you with the Misfortunes
of my Family, or relate the several Progres∣sions
it made towards the private Condition in
which it now is: For, besides that reciting the
Events of so many Hundred Years may haply,
in some measure, try your Patience, I should
be glad if you would dispense with me from
entering into a Detail of Accidents that would
sensibly afflict me: It shall suffice, therefore, to
inform you, that my Father, being a peaceable
Man, fond of Retirement and Tranquillity,
made no Attempts to recover the Sovereignty
from which his Ancestors had been unjustly
expelled; but quietly beheld the Kingdom of
<HI>Kent</HI> in the Possession of other Masters, while
he contented himself with the Improvement of
that small Pittance of Ground, which was all
<PB N="52" REF="54"/>
that the unhappy Prince <HI>Veridomer,</HI> my Grand∣father,
was able to bequeath to him.</P>
<P>Hey-day! cried Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> Will you new∣christen
your Grandfather, when he has been
in his Grave these Forty Years? I knew ho∣nest
Sir <HI>Edmard Bellmour</HI> very well, though I
was but a Youth when he died; but I be∣lieve
no Person in <HI>Kent</HI> ever gave him the
Title of Prince <HI>Veridomer:</HI> Fie! fie! these are
idle Brags.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George,</HI> without taking Notice of the old
Baronet's Heat, went on with his Narration in
this manner:</P>
<P>Things were in this State, Madam, when I
was born. I will not trouble you with the
Relation of what I did in my Infancy.</P>
<P>No, pray skip over all that, interrupted Sir
<HI>Charles;</HI> I suppose your Infancy was like other
Peoples? What can there be worth hearing in
that?</P>
<P>You are deceived, Sir, said <HI>Arabella:</HI> The
Infancy of illustrious Personages has always
something very extraordinary in it; and from
their childish Words and Actions there have
been often Presages drawn of their future
Greatness and Glory.</P>
<P>Not to disoblige Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> however, said
the young Prince of <HI>Kent,</HI> I will not repeat
many things, which I said and did in the first
Years of my Life, that those about me thought
very surprising; and from them prognosti∣cated,
that very strange Accidents would befal
me.</P>
<P>I have been a Witness of some very unfa∣vourable
Prognostics of you, said Sir <HI>Charles,</HI>
<PB N="53" REF="55"/>
smiling; for you was the most unlucky bold
Spark, that ever I knew in my Life.</P>
<P>'Tis very certain, pursued Sir <HI>George,</HI> that the
Forwardness of my Spirit gave great Uneasiness
to my Father; who, being, as I said before, in∣clinable
to a peaceable and sedentary Life, en∣deavoured
as much as possible to repress that
Vivacity in my Disposition, which he feared
might involve me in dangerous Enterprizes.
The Pains he took in my Education, I re∣compensed
by a more than ordinary Docility:
and, before I was Thirteen, performed all my
Exercises with a marvelous Grace; and, if I
may dare say so, was, at those early Years, the
Admiration and Wonder of all that saw me.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Bella</HI> had some Reason to fear your
Modesty, I find, said Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> smiling; for,
methinks you really speak too slightly of your
Excellencies.</P>
<P>However that may be, resumed Sir <HI>George;</HI>
my Father saw these early Instances of a tower∣ing
Genius in me, with a Pleasure, chastened
by his Fears, that the Grandeur of my Courage
would lead me to attempt something for the
Recovery of that Kingdom, which was my
Due; and which might haply occasion his losing
me.</P>
<P>Possessed with these Thoughts, he carefully
avoided saying any thing to me concerning the
glorious Pretences, to which my Birth gave me
a Right; and often wished it had been possible
for him to conceal from me, that I was the
true and lawful Heir of the Kingdom of <HI>Kent;</HI>
a Circumstance he never chose to mention to
<PB N="54" REF="56"/>
any Person, and would have been glad, if it
had always remained a Secret.</P>
<P>And so it was a Secret, interrupted Sir
<HI>Charles;</HI> for, till this Day, I never heard of it;
and it might still have been a Secret, if you had
pleased; for nobody, I dare say, would suspect
such a Thing; and very few, I believe, will
be inclined to think there is any thing in such
an improbable Tale.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding all my Father's Endeavours
to the contrary, Madam, pursued Sir <HI>George,</HI>
I cherished those towering Sentiments, the
Knowledge of my Birth inspired me with; and
it was not without the utmost Impatience, that
I brooked the private Condition, to which I
found myself reduced.</P>
<P>Cruel Fate! would I sometimes cry; was it
not enough to deprive me of that Kingdom,
which is my Due, and, subject me to a mean,
and inglorious State; but, to make that Condi∣tion
infinitely more grievous, must thou give
me a Soul, towering above my abject For∣tune?
A Soul, that cannot but disdain the base
Submission, I must pay to those, who triumph
in the Spoils of my ruined House? A Soul,
which sees nothing above its Hopes and Ex∣pectations?
And, in fine, a Soul, that excites
me daily to attempt Things worthy of my
Birth, and those noble Sentiments I inherit
from my great Forefathers? Ah! pursued I,
unhappy <HI>Bellmour;</HI> what hinders thee from
making thyself known and acknowleged for
what thou art? What hinders thee from bold∣ly
asserting thy just and natural Rights; and
<PB N="55" REF="57"/>
from defying the Usurper, who detains them
from thee? What hinders thee, I say?</P>
<P>What? Interrupted Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> why the
Fear of a Halter, I suppose: There is nothing
more easy than to answer that Question.</P>
<P>Such, Madam, said Sir <HI>George,</HI> were the
Thoughts, which continually disturbed my
Imagination; and, doubtless, they had not fail∣ed
to push me on to some hazardous Enter∣prize,
had not a fatal Passion interposed; and
by its sweet, but dangerous Allurements,
stifled for a while that Flame, which Ambi∣tion,
and the Love of Glory, kindled in my
Soul.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George</HI> here pausing, and fixing his Eyes
with a melancholy Air on the Ground, as if
prest with a tender Remembrance;</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> asked him, similing, If the
Thoughts of poor <HI>Dolly</HI> disturbed him? Pray,
added he, give us the History of your first
Love, without any Mixture of Fable; or shall
I take the Trouble off you? For you know, I
am very well acquainted with your Affair with
the pretty Milk-maid, and can tell it very suc∣cinctly.</P>
<P>'Tis true, Sir, said Sir <HI>George,</HI> sighing, I
cannot recall the Idea of <HI>Dorothea,</HI> into my
Remembrance, without some Pain: That fair,
but unfaithful Shepherdess, who first taught me
to sigh, and repaid my Tenderness with the
blackest Infidelity: Yet I will endeavour to
compose myself, and go on with my Narra∣tion.</P>
<P>Be pleased to know then, Madam, pursued
Sir <HI>George,</HI> that having my Thoughts, in this
<PB N="56" REF="58"/>
manner, wholly employed with the Disasters
of my Family, I had arrived to my seventeenth
Year, without being sensible of the Power of
Love; but the Moment now arrived, which
was to prove fatal to my Liberty. Following
the Chace one Day with my Father, and some
other Gentlemen, I happened to lag a little be∣hind
them; and, being taken up with my ordi∣nary
Reflections, I lost my Way, and wander∣ed
a long time, without knowing or consider∣ing
whither I was going. Chance at last con∣ducted
me to a pleasant Valley, surrounded
with Trees; and, being tired with riding, I
lighted, and tying my Horse to a Tree, walked
forward, with an Intention to repose myself a
few Moments under the Shade of one of those
Trees, that had attracted my Observation: But
while I was looking for the most convenient
Place, I spied, at the Distance of some few
Yards from me, a Woman lying asleep upon
the Grass: Curiosity tempted me to go nearer
this Person; and, advancing softly, that I
might not disturb her, I got near enough to
have a View of her Person: But, ah! Hea∣vens!
what Wonders did my Eyes encounter
in this View!—The Age of this fair Sleeper
seemed not to exceed Sixteen; her Shape was
formed with the exactest Symmetry; one of her
Hands supported her Head; the other, as it
lay carelesly stretched at her Side, gave me an
Opportunity of admiring its admirable Colour
and Proportion: The thin Covering upon her
Neck discovered Part of its inimitable Beauty
to my Eyes; but her Face, her lovely Face,
fixed all my Attention.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="59"/>
Certain it is, Madam, that, out of this Com∣pany,
it would be hard to find any thing so
perfect, as what I now viewed. Her Com∣plexion
was the purest White imaginable,
heightened by the inchanting Glow, which
dyed her fair Cheeks with a Colour like that
of a new-blown Rose: Her Lips, formed with
the greatest Perfection, and of a deeper Red,
seemed to receive new Beauties from the Fra∣grance
of that Breath, that parted from them:
Her auburn Hair fell in loose Ringlets over her
Neck; and some straggling Curls, that played
upon her fair Forehead, set off by a charming
Contrast the Whitness of that Skin it partly
hid: Her Eyes indeed were closed; and though
I knew not whether their Colour and Beauty
were equal to those other Miracles in her Face,
yet their Proportion seemed to be large; and
the snowy Lids, which covered them, were
admirably set off by those long and fable Lashes
that adorned them.</P>
<P>For some Moments I gazed upon this love∣ly
Sleeper, wholly lost in Wonder and Admira∣tion.</P>
<P>Where, whispered I, where has this Miracle
been concealed, that my Eyes were never bles∣sed
with the Sight of her before? These Words,
though I uttered them softly, and with the
utmost Caution; yet by the murmuring Noise
they made, caused an Emotion in the beauteous
Sleeper, that she started, and presently after
opened her Eyes: But what Words shall I find
to express the Wonder, the Astonishment, and
Rapture, which the Sight of those bright Stars
inspired me with? The Flames which darted
<PB N="58" REF="60"/>
from those glorious Orbs, cast such a dazling
Splendor upon a Sight too weak to bear a
Radiance so unusual, that, stepping back a few
Paces, I contemplated at a Distance, that
Brightness, which began already to kindle a
consuming Fire in my Soul.</P>
<P>Bless me! interrupted Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> con∣founded
at so pompous a Description; who
could this be?</P>
<P>The pretty Milk-maid, <HI>Dolly Acorn,</HI> replied
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> gravely: Did you never see her,
Sir, when you was at your Seat, at—?
She used often to bring Cream to my Lady.</P>
<P>Aye, aye, replied Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> I remember
her: She was a very pretty Girl: And so it was
from her Eyes, that all those Splendors and
Flames came, that had like to have burnt you
up, Sir <HI>George:</HI> Well, well, I guess how the
Story will end: Pray let us hear it out.</P>
<P>I have already told you, Madam, resumed
Sir <HI>George,</HI> the marvelous Effects the Sight of
those bright Eyes produced upon my Spirit: I
remained fixed in a Posture of Astonishment
and Delight; and all the Faculties of my Soul
were so absorbed in the Contemplation of the
Miracles before me, that I believe, had she
still continued before my Eyes, I should never
have moved from the Place where I then stood:
But the fair Virgin, who had spied me at the
small Distance to which I was retired, turned
hastily about, and flew away with extraordi∣nary
Swiftness.</P>
<P>When Love, now lending me Wings, whom
Admiration had before made motionless, I per∣sued
her so eagerly, that at last I overtook her;
<PB N="59" REF="61"/>
and, throwing myself upon my Knees before
her,</P>
<P>Stay, I conjure you, cried I; and if you be
a Divinity, as your celestial Beauty makes me
believe, do not refuse the Adoration I offer
you: But if, as I most ardently wish, you are
a Mortal, though sure the fairest that ever
graced the Earth; stop a Moment, to look up∣on
a Man, whose Respects for you as a Mor∣tal
fall little short of those Adorations he of∣fers
you as a Goddess.</P>
<P>I can't but think, cried Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> laughing,
how poor <HI>Dolly</HI> must be surprised at such a rho∣domontade
Speech!</P>
<P>Oh, Sir! replied Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> you will
find she will make as good a one.</P>
<P>Will she, by my Troth, said Sir <HI>Charles.</HI> I
don't know how to believe it.</P>
<P>This Action, pursued Sir <HI>George,</HI> and the
Words I uttered, a little surprised that fair
Maid, and brought a Blush into her lovely
Cheeks; but, recovering herself, she replied
with an admirable Grace,</P>
<P>I am no Divinity, said she; and therefore
your Adorations are misplaced: But if, as you
say, my Countenance moves you to any Re∣spect
for me, give me a Proof of it, by not
endeavouring to hold any further Discourse
with me, which is not permitted me from one
of your Sex and Appearance.</P>
<P>A very wise Answer, indeed! interrupted
Sir <HI>Charles</HI> again: Very few Town Ladies
would have disclaimed the Title of Goddess, if
their Lovers had thought proper to bestow it
<PB N="60" REF="62"/>
upon them. I am mightily pleased with the Girl
for her Ingenuity.</P>
<P>The Discretion of so young a Damsel, re∣sumed
Sir <HI>George,</HI> charmed me no less than her
Beauty; and I besought her, with the utmost
Earnestness, to permit me a longer Conversa∣tion
with her.</P>
<P>Fear not, lovely Virgin, said I, to listen to
the Vows of a Man, who, till he saw you,
never learnt to sigh: My Heart, which de∣fended
its Liberty against the Charms of many
admirable Ladies, yields, without Reluctance,
to the pleasing Violence your Beauties lay
upon me. Yes, too charming and dangerous
Stranger, I am no longer my own Master: It
is in your Power to dispose of my Destiny:
Consider therefore, I beseech you, whether you
can consent to see me die? For I swear to
you, by the most sacred Oaths, unless you pro∣mise
to have some Compassion on me, I will
no longer behold the Light of Day.</P>
<P>You may easily conceive, Madam, that, con∣sidering
this lovely Maid in the Character of
a Shepherdess, in which she appeared, I made
her a Declaration of my Passion, without think∣ing
myself obliged to observe those Respects,
which, to a Person of equal Rank with myself,
Decorum would not have permitted me to for∣get.</P>
<P>However, she repelled my Boldness with
so charming a Modesty, that I began to be∣lieve,
she might be a Person of illustrious Birth,
disguised under the mean Habit she wore: But,
having requested her to inform me who she was,
she told me, her Name was <HI>Dorothea;</HI> and that
<PB N="61" REF="63"/>
she was Daughter to a Farmer, that lived in
the neighbouring Valley. This Knowlege in∣creasing
my Confidence, I talked to her of my
Passion, without being the least afraid of of∣fending
her.</P>
<P>And therein you was greatly to blame, said
<HI>Arabella:</HI> For, truly, though the fair <HI>Dorothea</HI>
told you, she was Daughter to a Farmer; yet,
in all Probability, she was of a much higher
Extraction, if the Picture you have drawn of
her be true.</P>
<P>The fair <HI>Arsinoe,</HI> Princess of <HI>Armenia,</HI> was
constrained for a while to conceal her true
Name and Quality, and pass for a simple
Country-woman, under the Name of <HI>Delia:</HI>
Yet the generous <HI>Philadelph,</HI> Prince of <HI>Cilicia,</HI>
who saw and loved her under that Disguise,
treated her with all the Respect he would have
done, had he known she was the Daughter of a
King. In like manner, Prince <HI>Philoxipes,</HI> who
fell in Love with the beautiful <HI>Policrete,</HI> before
he knew she was the Daughter of the great
<HI>Solon;</HI> and while he looked upon her as a poor
Stranger, born of mean Parents; nevertheless,
his Love supplying the Want of those Advan∣tages
of Birth and Fortune, he wooed her with
a Passion as full of Awe and Delicacy, as if her
Extraction had been equal to his own. And
therefore those admirable Qualities the fair
<HI>Dorothea</HI> possessed, might also have convinced
you, she was not what she seemed, but, haply,
some great Princess in Disguise.</P>
<P>To tell you the Truth, Madam, replied Sir
<HI>George,</HI> notwithstanding the fair <HI>Dorothea</HI> in∣formed
me, she was of a mean Descent, I could
<PB N="62" REF="64"/>
not easily forego the Opinion, that she was of
an illustrious Birth: And the Histories of those
fair Princesses you have mentioned, coming in∣to
my Mind, I also thought it very possible,
that this divine Person might either be the
Daughter of a great King, or Lawgiver, like
them; but, being wholly engrossed by the Vio∣lence
of my new-born Affection, I listened to
nothing, but what most flattered my Hopes;
and, addressing my lovely Shepherdess with all
the Freedom of a Person who thinks his Birth
much superior to hers; she listened to my Pro∣testations,
without any seeming Reluctance,
and condescended to assure me before we part∣ed,
that she did not hate me. So fair a Begin∣ning,
seemed to promise me the most favour∣able
Fortune I could with Reason expect. I
parted from my fair Shepherdess with a thousand
Vows of Fidelity; exacting a Promise from
her, that she would meet me as often as she
conveniently could, and have the Goodness to
listen to those Assurances of inviolable Tender∣ness
my Passion prompted me to offer her.
When she left me, it seemed as if my Soul had
forsaken my Body to go after her: My Eyes
pursued her Steps as long as she was in Sight; I
envied the Ground she prest as she went along,
and the Breezes that kissed that celestial
Countenance in their Flight.</P>
<P>For some Hours I stood in the same Posture
in which she had left me; contemplating the
sudden Change I had experienced in my Heart,
and the Beauty of that divine Image, which
was now engraven in it. Night drawing on, I
began to think of going home; and, untying my
<PB N="63" REF="65"/>
Horse, I returned the Way I had come; and
at last struck into a Road, which brought me
to the Place where I parted from the Company;
from whence I easily found my Way home,
so changed both in my Looks and Carriage,
that my Father, and all my Friends, observed
the Alteration with some Surprize.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which Sir George, continuing his sur∣prising
History, relates a most stupen∣dous
Instance of a Valour only to be pa∣rallelled
by that of the great Oroondates,
Caesareo, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>FOR some Months, continued Sir <HI>George,</HI>
I prosecuted my Addresses to the admir∣able
<HI>Dorothea;</HI> and I flattered myself with a
Hope, that I had made some Progress in her
Heart: But, alas! this deceitful Fair-one, who
only laughed at the Torments she made me en∣dure,
at the time she vowed eternal Constancy
to me, gave her Hand to a Lover of her Fa∣ther's
providing, and abandoned me, without
Remorse, to the most cruel Despair.</P>
<P>I will not trouble you, Madam, with the
Repetition of those Complaints, which this
perfidious Action drew from me for a long time.
At length, my Courage enabling me to over∣come
the Violence of my Grief, I resolved to
think of the ungrateful <HI>Dorothea</HI> no more; and
<PB N="64" REF="66"/>
the Sight of another Beauty completing my
Cure, I no longer remembred the unfaithful
Shepherdess, but with Indifference.</P>
<P>Thus, Madam, have I faithfully related one
of those Infidelities, wherewith my Enemies
slander me; who can support their Assertion,
with no better Proof, than that I did not die,
when <HI>Dorothea</HI> abandoned me: But I submit
it to your Candour, whether an unfaithful
Mistress deserved such an Instance of Affec∣tion,
from a Lover she had betrayed?</P>
<P>Why, really, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> after a little
Pause, you had some Excuse to plead for your
Failure in this Point: And though you cannot
be called, the most perfect amongst Lovers,
seeing you neither died, nor was in Danger of
dying; yet neither ought you to be ranked
among those who are most culpable: But pray
proceed in your Story: I shall be better able to
form a right Judgment of your Merit as a Lo∣ver,
when I have heard all your Adventures.</P>
<P>My Passion for <HI>Dorothea,</HI> resumed Sir <HI>George,</HI>
being cured by her Treachery towards me,
the Love of Glory began again to revive in my
Soul. I panted after some Occasion to signa∣lize
my Valour, which yet I had met with no
Opportunity of doing; but, hearing that a
mighty Army was preparing to march upon a
secret Expedition, I privately quitted my Fa∣ther's
Seat; and, attended only by my faithful
'Squire, I took the same Route the Army had
taken, and arrived the Day before the terrible
Battle of—was fought, where, without
making myself known, I performed such Pro∣digies
of Valour, as astonished all who beheld
<PB N="65" REF="67"/>
me. Without doubt, I should have been highly
caressed by the Commander, who certainly
would have given me the Honour of a Victory
my Sword alone had procured for him; but,
having unwittingly engaged myself too far in
Pursuit of the flying Enemy, I found myself
alone, encompassed with a Party of about Five
hundred Men; who, seeing they were pursued
only by a single Man, faced about, and pre∣pared
to kill or take me Prisoner.</P>
<P>Pray, Sir, interrupted Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> when did
all this happen? And how came it to pass, that
your Friends have been ignorant to this Mo∣ment
of those Prodigies of Valour you per∣formed
at that Battle? I never heard you was
ever in a Battle: Fame has done you great In∣justice,
by concealing the Part you had in that
famous Victory.</P>
<P>The great Care I took to conceal myself,
replied Sir <HI>George,</HI> was one Reason why my
Friends did not attribute to me the Exploits,
which the Knight in black Armour, who was
no other than myself, performed; and the Ac∣cident
I am going to relate, prevented my be∣ing
discovered, while the Memory of those
great Exploits were yet fresh in the Minds of
those I had so greatly obliged.</P>
<P>Be pleased to know, therefore, Madam, that,
seeing myself about to be encompassed by this
Party of the Enemy, I disdained to fly; and,
though I was alone, resolved to sustain their
Attack, and sell my Life as dear as possible.</P>
<P>Why, if you did so, you was a Madman,
cried Sir <HI>Charles</HI> in a Heat: The bravest Man
that ever lived, would not have presumed to
<PB N="66" REF="68"/>
fight with so great a Number of Enemies. What
could you expect, but to be cut in Pieces?
Pooh! pooh! don't think any body will credit
such a ridiculous Tale: I never knew you was
so addicted to—</P>
<P>Lying, perhaps, the good Knight would have
said; but Sir <HI>George,</HI> who was concerned he
was present at his Legend, and could not
blame him for doubting his Veracity, prevent∣ed
his Utterance of a Word he would be oblig∣ed
to take ill, by abruptly going on with his
Story.</P>
<P>Placing my Back therefore against a Tree,
pursued he, to prevent my being assaulted be∣hind,
I presented my Shield to the Boldest of
these Assailants; who, having struck an impo∣tent
Blow upon it, as he was lifting up his Arm
to renew his Attack, I cut it off with one
Stroke of my Sword; and the same Instant
plunged it to the Hilt in the Breast of another,
and clove the Scull of a Third, who was mak∣ing
at me, in two Parts.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> at this Relation, burst into a
loud Fit of Laughter; and, being more inclined
to divert himself, than be offended at the Folly
and Vanity of the young Baronet, he permitted
him to go on with his surprising Story, with∣out
giving him any other Interruption.</P>
<P>These Three Executions, Madam, pursued
Sir <HI>George,</HI> were the Effects only of so many
Blows; which raised such Indignation in my
Enemies, that they prest forward in great Num∣bers
to destroy me; but, having, as I before
said, posted myself so advantageously, that I
could only be assaulted before, not more than
<PB N="67" REF="69"/>
Three or Four could attack me at one time. The
Desire of lengthening out my Life, till happily
some Succour might come to my Relief, so in∣vigorated
my Arm, and added to my ordinary
Strength an almost irresistible Force, that I dealt
Death at every Blow; and in less than a quar∣ter
of an Hour, saw more than Fifty of my
Enemies at my Feet, whose Bodies served for a
Bulwark against their Fellows Swords.</P>
<P>The Commander of this little Body, not
having Generosity enough to be moved with
those prodigious Effects of my Valour in my
Favour, was transported with Rage at my Re∣sistance;
and the Sight of so many of his Men
slain before his Face, served only to increase
his Fury; and that Moment, seeing, that, with
Two more Blows, I had sent Two of his most
valiant Soldiers to the Shades, and that the rest
fearing to come within the Length of my
Sword, had given me a few Moments Re∣spite,</P>
<P>Ah! Cowards! cried he, are you afraid of
a single Man? And will you suffer <HI>him</HI> to
escape from your Vengeance, who has slain so
many of your brave Comrades before your
Eyes?</P>
<P>These Words inspiring them with a Fierce∣ness,
such as he desired, they advanced towards
me with more Fury than before: By this time,
I had received several large Wounds, and my
Blood ran down from many Parts of my Body:
Yet was I not sensible of any Decay of Strength,
nor did the settled Designs of my Enemies to
destroy me daunt me in the least: I still relied
upon the Assistance I expected Providence
<PB N="68" REF="70"/>
would send to my Relief, and determined, if
possible, to preserve my Life, till it arrived.</P>
<P>I fought, therefore, with a Resolution, which
astonished my Enemies, but did not move them
to any Regard for my Safety: And, observing
their brutal Commander, a few Paces from me,
encouraging his Men, both with his Cries and
Gestures, Indignation against this inhuman
Wretch so transported me out of my Discre∣tion,
that I quitted my Post, in order to sacri∣fice
him to my Revenge.</P>
<P>Seeing me advance furiously towards him, he
turned pale with Fear, and endeavoured to shel∣ter
himself in the midst of his Men; who, more
valiant than himself, opposed themselves to my
Rage, to favour his Retreat: But quickly clear∣ing
myself a Way with my Sword, I pressed to∣wards
the barbarous Coward; and, ere he could
avoid the Blow I aimed at him, it struck him
senseless at my Feet.</P>
<P>My particular Revenge thus satisfied, I was
sensible of the Fault I had committed in quit∣ting
my Post, by which I exposed myself to be
surrounded by the Enemy. I endeavoured to
regain it, but in vain: I was beset on all Sides,
and now despaired of any Safety; and there∣fore
only fought to die courageously, and make
as many of my Enemies as I could, attend
my Fall.</P>
<P>Exasperated by the Misfortune of their Com∣mander,
they pressed upon me with redoubled
Fury. Faint as I was, with the Loss of Blood,
and so fatigued with the past Action, and the
obstinate Fight I had maintained so long with
such a considerable Number, I could hardly any
<PB N="69" REF="71"/>
longer lift up my Arm; and, to complete, my
Misfortune, having thrust my Sword into the
Body of one of the forwardest of my Enemies,
in my endeavouring to regain it, it broke in
Pieces, and the Hilt only remained in my Hand.</P>
<P>This Accident completed my Defeat: De∣prived
of my Sword, I was no longer capable
of making any Defence: Several of them pressed
upon me at once; and, throwing me down,
tied my Hands together behind me. Shame and
Rage at this Indignity worked so forcibly up∣on
my Spirts, weakened as I then was, that I
fell into a Swoon. What happened till my Re∣covery,
I am not able to tell; but, at the Re∣turn
of my Senses, I found myself laid on a
Bed in a tolerable Chamber, and some Persons
with me, who kept a profound Silence.</P>

was Prisoner to Persons who had been Wit∣nesses
of the great Quantity of Blood I had
shed in my own Defence. My Wounds had
been dressed while I continued in my Swoon;
and the Faces of those Persons who were about
me, expressed nothing of Unkindness.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="72"/>
After reflecting some time longer on my
Situation, I called to a young Man, who sat
near my Bed-side, and intreated him to inform
me, Where I was, and to whom I was a Pri∣soner?
But could get no other Answer to those
Questions, than a most civil Intreaty to com∣pose
myself, and not protract the Cure of my
Wounds by talking, which, the Surgeons had
declared, would be of a bad Consequence;
and had therefore ordered me to be as little
disturbed as possible.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this Remonstrance, I re∣peated
my Request, promising to be entirely
governed by them for the future in what re∣garded
my Health, provided they would satisfy
me in those Particulars: But my Attendant did
not so much as reply to those Importunities;
but, to prevent the Continuance of them, rose
from his Seat, and retired to the other End of
the Chamber.</P>
<P>I passed that Day, and several others, with∣out
being able to learn the Truth of my Condi∣tion:
All this time, I was diligently waited on
by the two Persons I had first seen, neither
of whom I could prevail upon to inform me
of what I desired to know; and, judging, by
this obstinate Reserve, and the Manner of my
Treatment, that there was some Mystery in
the Case, I forbore to ask them any more
Questions, conceiving they had particular Or∣ders
not to answer them.</P>
<P>The Care that was taken to forward my
Cure, in Three Weeks entirely restored me
to Health: I longed impatiently to know,
what was to be my Destiny; and busied myself
<PB N="71" REF="73"/>
in conjecturing it, in vain; when, one Morning,
an elderly Lady entered my Chamber, at whose
Appearance my Two Attendants retired.</P>
<P>After she had saluted me very civilly, and
inquired after my Health, she seated herself in
a Chair near my Bedside, and spoke to me in
this manner:</P>
<P>I make no question, Sir, but you are sur∣prised
at the Manner in which you have been
treated, and the Care there has been taken to
prevent discovering to you the Place where
you now are; but you will doubtless be more
surprised, to hear you are in the Fortress of—,
and in the House of Prince <HI>Marcomire,</HI> whose
Party you fought against alone; and whom
you so dangerously wounded, before you was
taken Prisoner by his Men.</P>
<P>Is it possible, Madam, said I, who, from
the first Moment of her Appearance, had been
in a strange Perplexity, is it possible, I am in
the House of a Man, whose Life I endeavoured
so eagerly to destroy? And is it to him, who
oppressed me so basely with Numbers, that I
am obliged for the Succour I have received?</P>
<P>It is not to him, replied the Lady, that you
are obliged for the favourable Treatment you
have had; but listen to me patiently, and I
will disclose the Truth of your Adventure.</P>
<P>Prince <HI>Marcomire,</HI> who was the Person that
headed that Party against which you so valiant∣ly
defended yourself, after the Loss of the
Battle, was hastening to throw himself into
this Place, where his Sister, and many Ladies
of Quality, had come for Security: Your in∣discreet
<PB N="72" REF="74"/>
Pursuit engaged you in the most un∣equal
Combat that ever was fought; and—</P>
<P>Nay, Sir, interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> though I do
not refuse to give you all the Praises your gal∣lant
Defence of yourself against Five hundred
Men deserves; yet I cannot agree with that
Lady, in saying, it was the most unequal Com∣bat
that ever was fought: For, do but reflect, I
beseech you, upon that which the brave Prince
of <HI>Mauritania</HI> sustained against twice that Num∣ber
of Men, with no other Arms than his
Sword; and, you having been in Battle that
Day, was, as I conceive, completely armed.
The young Prince of <HI>Egypt,</HI> accompanied only
by the valiant, but indiscreet, <HI>Cepio</HI> his Friend,
engaged all the King of <HI>Armenia</HI>'s Guards,
and put them all to Flight. The courageous
<HI>Ariobasanes</HI> scorned to turn his Back upon a
whole Army; not to mention the invincible
<HI>Artaban,</HI> whom a thousand Armies together
could not have made to turn.</P>
<P>Be pleased to observe, Madam, said Sir <HI>George,</HI>
that to the end I may faithfully recount my
History, I am under a Necessity of repeating
Things, which, haply, may seem too advan∣tageous
for a Man to say of himself: Therefore
I indeed greatly approve of the Custom, which,
no doubt, this Inconveniency introduced, of a
'Squire, who is thoroughly instructed with the
Secrets of his Master's Heart, relating his Ad∣ventures,
and giving a proper Eulogium of his
rare Valour, without being in Danger of of∣fending
the Modesty of the renowned Knight;
who, as you know, Madam, upon those Oc∣casions,
commodiously slips away.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="75"/>
It being, however, this Lady's Opinion, that
no Man ever undertook a more hazardous Com∣bat,
or with greater Odds, against him, she did
not fail to express her Admiration of it, in very
high Terms.</P>
<P>The Noise of this Accident, pursued she,
was soon spread over the whole Town; and
the beautiful <HI>Sydimiris, Marcomire</HI>'s Sister, hear∣ing
that her Brother was wounded, as it was
thought to Death, and that the Person who
killed him, was taken Prisoner; she flew out
to meet her wounded Brother, distracted with
Grief, and vowing to have the severest Tor∣tures
executed on him, who had thus barba∣rously
murdered her Brother. Those who bore
that unhappy Prince, having brought him into
the House, his Wounds were searched; and
the Surgeons declared, they were very dan∣gerous.</P>
<P><HI>Sydimiris,</HI> hearing this, redoubled her Com∣plaints
and Vows of Vengeance against you:
Her Brother having then the chief Authority in
the Place, she commanded, in his Name, to
have you brought hither, and to be most strictly
guarded; determined, if her Brother died, to
sacrifice you to his Ghost.</P>
<P>Full of these sanguinary Resolutions, she
left his Chamber, having seen him laid in Bed;
and his Wounds dressed; but passing along a
Gallery to her own Apartment, she met the
Persons who were bringing you to the Room
that was to be your Prison: You was not, pur∣sued
the Lady, yet recovered from your Swoon,
so that they carried you like one that was dead:
They had taken off your Helmet to give you
<PB N="74" REF="76"/>
Air; by which means your Face being quite
uncovered, pale, languishing, and your Eyes
closed, as if in Death, presented the most
moving, and, at the same time, most pleasing
Object in the World.</P>
<P><HI>Sydimiris,</HI> who stopt, and for a Moment
eagerly gazed upon you, lost all of a sudden
the Fierceness, which before had animated her
against you: And lifting up her Eyes to view
those Men that carried you;</P>
<P>Are you sure, said she to them, that this is
the Person who wounded my Brother?</P>
<P>Yes, Madam, replied one of them; this must
be he, since there was no other in his Com∣pany;
and he alone sustained the Attack of Five
hundred Men; and would probably not have
left one of them alive, had not his Sword, by
breaking, put it into our Power to take him
Prisoner.</P>
<P>Carry him away, said <HI>Sydimiris;</HI> but let his
Wounds be dressed, and let him be carefully
looked to, that, if my Brother dies, he may
be punished as he deserves.</P>
<P>Pronouncing these Words in a low and fal∣tering
Voice, she turned her Eyes a second time
upon you; then, hastily averting her Looks,
she hurried to her own Chamber, and threw
herself into a Chair, with all the Marks of a
very great Disturbance.</P>
<P>The Affection I have for her, being the Per∣son
who had brought her up, and most favoured
with her Confidence, made me behold her in
this Condition with great Concern; and sup∣posing
it was her Brother that disquieted her,
I besought her not to give way to the Violence
<PB N="75" REF="77"/>
of her Grief, but to hope that Heaven would
restore him to her Prayers.</P>
<P>Alas! my dear <HI>Urinoe,</HI> said she, I am more
culpable than you can imagine; and I grieve less
for the Condition to which I see <HI>Marcomire</HI> re∣duced,
than for that Moderation wherewith I
am constrained, spite of myself, to behold his
Enemy.</P>
<P>Yes, dear <HI>Urinoe,</HI> pursued she, blushing,
and casting down her Eyes, the Actions of
this Unknown appear to me in quite another
Light, since I have seen him; and, instead of
looking upon him as the Murderer of my Bro∣ther,
I cannot help admiring that rare Valour,
with which he defended himself against so great
a Number of Enemies; and am even ready to
condemn the furious <HI>Marcomire,</HI> for oppressing
so brave a Man.</P>
<P>As I had never approved of those violent
Transports of Grief and Rage, which she had
expressed upon the first News of her Brother's
Misfortune; and as I looked upon your glo∣rious
Defence with the utmost Admiration; so,
far from condemning the Change of her
Thoughts, I confirmed her in the favourable
Opinion she began to entertain of you; and,
continuing to make Remarks upon all the Par∣ticulars
of the Combat, which had come to
our Knowlege, we found nothing in your Be∣haviour,
but what increased our Admiration.</P>
<P><HI>Sydimiris</HI> therefore, following the Dictates
of her own Generosity, as well as my Advice,
placed Two Persons about you, whose Fide∣lity
we could rely on; and gave them Orders
to treat you with all imaginable Care and Re∣spect,
<PB N="76" REF="78"/>
but not to inform you of the Place in
which you was, or to whom you was Pri∣soner.</P>
<P>In the mean time, <HI>Marcomire,</HI> whose
Wounds had been again examined, was de∣clared
out of Danger by the Surgeons; and he
having understood the Excess of his Sister's
Grief, and the Revenge she had vowed against
you, gave her Thanks for those Expressions of
her Tenderness; and also uttered some Threats,
which intimated a violent Hatred against you;
and a Design of prosecuting his Revenge upon
you, as soon as he was in a Condition to leave
his Chamber.</P>
<P><HI>Sydimiris,</HI> who heard him, could with Dif∣ficulty
dissemble her Concern.</P>
<P>Ah! <HI>Urinoe,</HI> said she to me, when we were
alone; 'tis now, that I more than ever repent
of that Excess of Rage, which transported me
against the brave Unknown. I have thereby
put him intirely into my Brother's Power, and
shall be haply accessary to that Death he is
meditating for him, or else a perpetual Impri∣sonment.</P>
<P>This Reflection gave her so much Pain, that
I could not choose but pity her; and consider∣ing,
that the only way to preserve you, was
for her to dissemble a Rage equal to <HI>Mar∣comire</HI>'s
against you, in order to prevent being
suspected of any Design in your Favour, I per∣suaded
her to join with him in every thing he
said; while, in the mean time, we would en∣deavour
to get you cured of your Wounds, that
you might at least be in a Condition once more
<PB N="77" REF="79"/>
to defend yourself with that miraculous Valour
Heaven has bestowed on you.</P>
<P><HI>Sydimiris</HI> perceiving her Brother would soon
be in a Condition to execute his Threats, resolv∣ed
to hazard every thing, rather than to expose
you to his Rage: She therefore communicated
to me her Design of giving you Liberty, and,
by presenting a sufficient Reward to your
Guard, inducing them to favour your Escape.</P>
<P>I undertook to manage this Business in her
Name, and have done it so effectually, that
you will this Night be at Liberty, and may
depart the Town immediately, in which it will
be dangerous to stay any time, for fear of
being discovered.</P>
<P><HI>Sydimiris</HI> forbad me to let you know the
Person to whom you would be obliged for your
Freedom; but I could not endure, that you
should unjustly involve the Sister of <HI>Marcomire,</HI>
in that Resentment you will questionless always
preserve against <HI>him;</HI> and to keep you from being
innocently guilty of Ingratitude, I resolved to
acquaint you with the Nature of those Obliga∣tions
you owe to her.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Adventure continued.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AH! Madam, said I, perceiving she had
finished her Discourse, doubt not but I
shall most gratefully preserve the Remembrance
of what the generous <HI>Sydimiris</HI> has done for me;
<PB N="78" REF="80"/>
and shall always be ready to lose that Life in
her Defence, which she has had the superlative
Goodness to take so much Care of. But, Ma∣dam,
pursued I, with an earnest Look, do not,
I beseech you, refuse me one Favour, without
which I shall depart with inconceivable Sorrow.</P>
<P>Depend upon it, valiant Sir, replied she,
that if what you will require of me, be in my
Power, and fit for me to grant, I shall very
willingly oblige you.</P>
<P>It is then, resumed I, trembling at the Bold∣ness
of my Request, that you would conde∣scend
to intreat the most generous <HI>Sydimiris</HI> to
favour me with an Interview, and give me an
Opportunity of throwing myself at her Feet,
to thank her for all those Favours I have re∣ceived
from her Compassion.</P>
<P>I cannot promise you, replied the Lady,
rising, to prevail upon <HI>Sydimiris</HI> to grant you an
Audience; but I assure you, that I will endea∣vour
to dispose her to do you this Favour; and
it shall not be my Fault, if you are not sa∣tisfied.</P>
<P>Saying this, she went out of my Chamber,
I having followed her to the Door, with Pro∣testations
that I would never forget her Kindness
upon this Occasion.</P>
<P>I past the rest of that Day in an anxious Im∣patience
for Night, divided between Fear and
Hope, and more taken up with the Thoughts
of seeing <HI>Sydimiris,</HI> than with my expected
Liberty.</P>
<P>Night came at last, and the Door of my
Apartment opening, I saw the Lady who had
been with me in the Morning, enter.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="81"/>
I have prevailed upon <HI>Sydimiris</HI> to see you,
said she; and she is willing, at my Intreaty, to
grant that Favour to a Person, who, she with
Reason thinks, has been inhumanly treated by
her Brother.</P>
<P>Then, giving me her Hand, she conducted
me along a large Gallery, to a stately Apart∣ment;
and after traversing several Rooms, she
led me into one, where <HI>Sydimiris</HI> herself was:
Who, as soon as she perceived me, rose from
her Seat, and received me with great Civility.</P>
<P>In the Transport I then was, I know not
how I returned the grateful Salute the incom∣parable
<HI>Sydimiris</HI> gave me; for most certain
it is, that I was so lost in Wonder, at the Sight
of the many Charms I beheld in her Person,
that I could not unlock my Tongue, or re∣move
my Eyes from her inchanting Face; but
remained fixed in a Posture, which at once ex∣pressed
my Admiration and Delight.</P>
<P>To give you a Description of that Beauty
which I then contemplated, I must inform
you, Madam, that <HI>Sydimiris</HI> is tall, of a hand∣some
Stature, and admirably proportioned; her
Hair was of the finest Black in the World; her
Complexion marvelously fair; and all the Li∣neaments
of her Visage were perfectly beauti∣ful;
and her Eyes, which were large and black,
sparkled with so quick and piercing a Fire, that
no Heart was able to resist their powerful
Glances: Moreover, <HI>Sydimiris</HI> is admirably
shaped; her Port is high and noble; and her
Air so free, yet so commanding, that there are
few Persons in the World, with whom she may
not dispute the Priority of Beauty: In fine,
<PB N="80" REF="82"/>
Madam, <HI>Sydimiris</HI> appeared with so many Ad∣vantages,
to a Spirit prepossessed already with
the most grateful Sense of her Favours, that
I could not resist the sweet Violence wherewith
her Charms took Possession of my Heart: I
yielded therefore, without Reluctance, to my
Destiny, and resigned myself, in an Instant, to
those Fetters, which the Sight of the Divine
<HI>Sydimiris</HI> prepared for me: Recovering there∣fore
a little from that Admiration, which
had so totally ingrossed all my Faculties, I
threw myself at her Feet, with an Action whol∣ly
composed of Transport.</P>
<P>Divine <HI>Sydimiris,</HI> said I, beholding her with
Eyes, in which the Letters of my new-born
Passion might very plainly be read, see at
your Feet a Man devoted to your Service, by
all the Ties of Gratitude and Respect. I come,
Madam, to declare to you, that from the First
Moment you gave me Liberty, I had devoted
that and my Life to you; and at your Feet I
confirm the Gift; protesting by all that is most
dear and sacred to me, that since I hold my
Life from the Divine <HI>Sydimiris,</HI> she alone shall
have the absolute Disposal of it for the future;
and shuld she please again to demand it, either
to appease her Brother's Fury, or to sacrifice
it to her own Security, I will most faithfully
perform her Will, and shed the last Drop of
that Blood at her Command, which I would
with Transport lose in her Defence.</P>
<P>A fine high-flown Speech indeed! said Sir
<HI>Charles,</HI> laughing; but I hope you did not in∣tend
to keep your Word.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="83"/>
Sure, Sir, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> you do not ima∣gine,
that Sir <HI>George</HI> would have failed in
executing all he had promised to the beautiful
and generous <HI>Sydimiris:</HI> What could he possi∣bly
have said less? And indeed what less could
she have expected from a Man, whom at the
Hazard of her own Life and Happiness, she had
given Freedom to?</P>
<P>I accompanied these Words, Madam, pur∣sued
Sir <HI>George,</HI> with so passionate a Look and
Accent, that the fair <HI>Sydimiris</HI> blushed, and,
for a Moment, cast down her Eyes with a
visible Confusion. At last,</P>
<P>Sir, replied she, I am too well satisfied with
what I have done, with respect to your Safety,
to require any Proofs of your Gratitude, that
might be dangerous to it; and shall remain ex∣tremely
well satisfied, if the Obligations you
think you owe me, may induce you to mode∣rate
your Resentment against my Brother, for
the cruel Treatment you received from him.</P>
<P>Doubt not, Madam, interrupted I, eagerly,
but I shall, in the Person of <HI>Marcomire,</HI> regard
the Brother of the divine <HI>Sydimiris;</HI> and that
Consideration will be sufficient, not only to
make me forget all the Violences he committed
against me, but even to desend his Life, if need
be, with the Hazard of my own.</P>
<P>Excessively generous indeed! said Sir <HI>Charles:</HI>
I never heard any thing like it.</P>
<P>Oh! dear, Sir, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> there are
numberless Instances of equal, and even supe∣rior
Generosity, to be met with in the L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ves of
the Heroes of Antiquity: You will there see
a Lover, whose Mistress has been taken from
<PB N="82" REF="84"/>
him, either by Treachery or Force, venture
his Life in Defence of the injurious Husband
who possesses her; and though all his Felicity
depends upon his Death, yet he will rescue him
from it, at the Expence of the greater Part of
his Blood.</P>
<P>Another, who after a long and bloody War,
has, by taking his Enemy Prisoner, an Oppor∣tunity
of terminating it honourably; yet, thro'
an heroick Principle of Generosity, he gives
his Captive Liberty, without making any Con∣ditions,
and has all his Work to do over again.</P>
<P>A Third, having contracted a violent Friend∣ship
with the Enemies of his Country, through
the same generous Sentiments, draws his Sword
in their Defence, and makes no Scruple to fight
against an Army, where the King his Father
is in Person.</P>
<P>I must confess, said Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> that Gene∣rosity
seems to me very peculiar, that will make
a Man fight for his Enemies against his own
Father.</P>
<P>It is in that Peculiarity, Sir, said <HI>Arabella,</HI>
that his Generosity consists; for certainly there
is nothing extraordinary in fighting for one's
Father, and one's Country; but when a Man
has arrived to such a Pitch of Greatness of
Soul, as to neglect those mean and selfish Con∣siderations,
and, loving Virtue in the Persons
of his Enemies, can prefer their Glory before
his own particular Interest, he is then a perfect
Hero indeed: Such a one was <HI>Oroondates, Ar∣taxcrxes,</HI>
and many others I could name, who
all gave eminent Proofs of their Disinterested∣ness
and Greatness of Soul, upon the like Oc∣casions:
<PB N="83" REF="85"/>
Therefore not, to detract from Sir
<HI>George</HI>'s Merit, I must still insist, that in the
Resolutions he had taken to defend his Ene∣my's
Life at the Expence of his own, he did
no more, than what any Man of ordinary Ge∣nerosity
ought to do, and what he was particu∣larly
obliged to, by what the amiable <HI>Sydimiris</HI>
had done for him.</P>
<P>I was so happy, however, Madam, continued
Sir <HI>George,</HI> to find that those Expressions of my
Gratitude wrought somewhat upon the Heart
of the lovely <HI>Sydimiris</HI> in my Favour: Her
Words discovered as much, and her Eyes spoke
yet more intelligibly; but our Conversation was
interrupted by the discreet <HI>Urinoe,</HI> who, fearing
the Consequence of so long a Stay in her Cham∣ber,
represented to me, that it was time to
take my Leave.</P>
<P>I turned pale at this cruel Sound; and, be∣holding
<HI>Sydimiris</HI> with a languishing Look,</P>
<P>Would to Heaven, Madam, said I, that
instead of giving me Liberty, you would keep
me eternally your Prisoner; for though a Dun∣geon
was to be the Place of my Confinement,
yet if it was near you, it would seem a Palace
to me; for indeed I am no longer in a Condi∣tion
to relish that Freedom you bestow upon
me, since it must remove me farther from you:
But I beseech you, Madam, to believe, that in
delivering me from your Brother's Fetters, you
have cast me into your own, and that I am more
a Prisoner than ever, but a Prisoner to so lovely
a Conqueror, that I do not wish to break my
Chains, and prefer the sweet and glorious Cap∣tivity
<PB N="84" REF="86"/>
I am in, to all the Crowns in the
World.</P>
<P>You are very bold, said <HI>Sydimiris,</HI> blushing,
to entertain me with such Discourse; yet I
pardon this Offence, in Consideration of what
you have suffered from my Brother, and on
Condition that you will depart immediately,
without speaking another Word.</P>
<P><HI>Sydimiris</HI> spoke this so earnestly, that I durst
not disobey her; and, kissing the Hem of her
Robe, with a passionate Air, I left ber Cham∣ber,
conducted by <HI>Urinoe;</HI> who having brought
me to a private Door, which carried us into
the Street, I there found a Man waiting for
me, whom I knew to be the same that had
attended me during my Stay in that House.</P>
<P><HI>Urinoe</HI> having recommended to him to see
me safe out of the Town, I took Leave of
her, with the most grateful Acknowlegements
for her Kindness; and followed my Conductor,
so oppressed with Grief at the Thoughts of
leaving the Place where <HI>Sydimiris</HI> was, that I
had hardly Strength to walk.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>An extraordinary Instance of Generosity in
a Lover, somewhat resembling that of the
great Artaxerxes, in Cassandra.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE farther I went, continued Sir <HI>George,</HI>
the more my Regret increased; and,
finding it would be impossible to live, and quit
<PB N="85" REF="87"/>
the Divine <HI>Sydimiris,</HI> I all at once took a Re∣solution
to remain in the Town concealed; and,
communicating my Design to my Guide, I en∣gaged
him to assist me in it, by a Present of a
considerable Sum, which he could not resist:
Accordingly he left me in a remote Part of the
Town, and went to find out a convenient Lodg∣ing
for me; which he soon procured, and also
a Suit of Cloaths to disguise me, my own being
very rich and magnificent.</P>
<P>Having recommended me as a Relation of
his, who was newly arrived, I was received
very civilly by the People with whom he placed
me; and, finding this young Man to be very
witty and discreet, and also very capable of
serving me, I communicated to him my In∣tentions
by staying, which were only to be near
the Divine <HI>Sydimiris,</HI> and to have the Happiness
of sometimes seeing her, when she went
abroad.</P>
<P>This Man entering into my Meaning, assured
me, he would faithfully keep my Secret; and
that he would not fail to bring me Intelligence
of all that passed in the Palace of <HI>Marcomire.</HI></P>
<P>I could with Difficulty keep myself from
falling at his Feet, to express my Sense of his
kind and generous Offers; but I contented
myself with presenting him another Sum of
Money, larger than the first, and assured him
of my future Gratitude.</P>
<P>He then took Leave, and left me to my Re∣flections,
which were wholly upon the Image
of the Divine <HI>Sydimiris,</HI> and the Happiness of
being so near the Object I adored.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="88"/>
My Confident came to me the next Day;
but brought me no other News, than that my
Escape was not yet known to <HI>Marcomire.</HI> I
inquired if he had seen <HI>Sydimiris;</HI> but he re∣plied
he had not, and that <HI>Urinoe</HI> had only
asked him, if he had conducted me safe out of
Town: To which he had answered as we had
agreed, that I had got out safe and undisco∣vered.</P>
<P>A Day or two after, he brought me News
more pleasing; for he told me, that <HI>Sydimiris</HI>
had sent for him into her Chamber, and asked
him several Questions concerning me: That
she appeared very melancholy, and even blush∣ed,
whenever she mentioned my Name.</P>
<P>This Account gave sufficient Matter for my
Thoughts to work upon for several Days. I
interpreted <HI>Sydimiris</HI>'s Blush a Thousand differ∣ent
Ways; I reflected upon all the different
Causes to which it might be owing, and busied
myself with all those innumerable Conjectures,
which, as you know, Madam, such an Incident
always gives Rise to in a Lover's Imagination.
At length I explained it to my own Advantage,
and felt thereby a considerable Increase of my
Affection.</P>
<P>A whole Week having elapsed, without
another Sight of my Confidant, I began to be
greatly alarmed; when, on the Eighth Day of
this cruel Suspense, I saw him appear; but with
so many Marks of Disturbance in his Face,
that I trembled to hear what he had to acquaint
me with.</P>
<P>Oh! Sir, said he, as soon as his Concern
suffered him to speak, <HI>Marcomire</HI> has discovered
<PB N="87" REF="89"/>
your Escape, and the Means by which it was pro∣cured:
One of those in whom <HI>Urinoe</HI> confided,
has betrayed it to him; and the beauteous <HI>Sy∣dimiris</HI>
is likely to feel the most terrible Effects
of his Displeasure: He has confined her to her
Chamber, and vows to sacrifice her Life to the
Honour of his Family; which he says, she
has stained; and he loads that admirable Lady
with so many Reproaches, that it is thought,
her Grief for such undeserved Calumnies will
occasion her Death.</P>
<P>Scarce had he finished these cruel Words,
when I, who all the time he had been speaking,
beheld him with a dying Eye, sunk down at
his Feet in a Swoon; which continued so long,
that he began to think me quite dead: How∣ever
I at last opened my Eyes; but it was only
to pour forth a River of Tears, and to utter
Complaints, which might have moved the most
obdurate Heart.</P>
<P>After having a long time tormented myself
in weeping and complaining, I at last took a
Resolution, which afforded me some Alleviation
of my Grief; and the faithful <HI>Toxares,</HI> seeing
me a little composed, left me to myself, with
a Promise to return soon, and acquaint me with
what passed further in the Palace of <HI>Marcomire.</HI></P>
<P>As soon as he was gone, I rose from my Bed;
and, dressing myself in those Cloaths I wore
when I was taken Prisoner, I went to the Pa∣lace
of <HI>Marcomire;</HI> and, demanding to see him,
I was told he was in the Apartment of <HI>Sydimi∣ris;</HI>
and, at my earnest Desire, they conducted
me thither.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="90"/>
When I entered the Room, I beheld that
incomparable Beauty stretched upon a Couch,
dissolved in Tears; and <HI>Urinoe</HI> upon her Knees,
before her, accompanying with her own, those
precious Drops which fell from the bright Eyes
of her Mistress.</P>
<P><HI>Marcomire,</HI> who was walking furiously about
the Room, exclaiming with the utmost Vio∣lence
against that fair Sufferer, did not observe
my Entrance; so that I had an Opportunity of
going towards <HI>Sydimiris,</HI> who, lifting up her
Eyes to look upon me, gave a loud Shriek;
and, by a Look of extreme Anguish, let me
understand, how great her Apprehensions were
upon my Account.</P>
<P>I am come, Madam, said I, to perform
Part of the Promise I made you, and by dying,
to prove your Innocence; and, freeing you from
the Reproaches you suffer on my Account, I
shall have the Happiness to convince you, that
my Life is infinitely less dear to me, than your
Tranquillity. <HI>Sydimiris,</HI> who hearkened to
me with great Emotion, was going to make
some Answer, when <HI>Marcomire,</HI> alarmed by
his Sister's Shriek, came towards us, and, view∣ing
me at first with Astonishment, and then
with a Smile of Cruelty and Revenge,</P>
<P>Is it possible, said he, that I behold my de∣signed
Murderer again in my Power?</P>
<P>I am in thy Power, said I, because I am
willing to be so; and came voluntarily to put
myself into your Hands, to free that excellent
Lady from the Imputation you have laid on her:
Know, <HI>Marcomire,</HI> that it is to myself alone
I owed my Liberty, which I would still pre∣serve
<PB N="89" REF="91"/>
against all the Forces thou couldst bring to
deprive me of it; and this Sword, which left
thee Life enough to threaten mine, would haply
once more put yours in Danger, were I not re∣strained
by a powerful Consideration, which
leaves me not the Liberty of even wishing you
ill.</P>
<P>Ah! Dissembler, said <HI>Marcomire,</HI> in a Rage,
think not to impose upon me by thy counter∣feited
Mildness: Thou art my Prisoner once
more, and I shall take care to prevent your
escaping a Second time.</P>
<P>I am not your Prisoner, replied I, while I
possess this Sword, which has already defended
me against greater Numbers than you have here
to oppose me; but, continued I, throwing down
my Sword at <HI>Sydimiris</HI>'s Feet, I resign my Li∣berty
to restore that Lady to your good Opi∣nion,
and to free her from those base Aspersions
thou hast unjustly loaded her with, upon my
Account.</P>
<P>It matters not, said the brutal Brother, taking
up my Sword, whether thou hast resigned, or
I have deprived thee of Liberty; but since thou
art in my Power, thou shall feel all the Effects
of my Resentment: Take him away, pursued
he to some of his People; put him into the worst
Dungeon you can find; and let him be guarded
carefully, upon Pain of Death, if he again
escapes.</P>
<P>With these Words, several Men offered to
lead me out of the Room; but I repulsed them
with Disdain; and, making a low Reverence to
<HI>Sydimiris,</HI> whose Countenance expressed the
Extremes of Fear and Anguish, I followed my
<PB N="90" REF="92"/>
Conductors to the Prison allotted for me; which,
hideous as it was, I contemplated with a secret
Pleasure, since I had by that Action, which
had brought me into it, given a Testimony of
my Love for the adorable <HI>Sydimiris.</HI></P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which it will be seen, that the Lady is

</ARGUMENT>
<P>I Passed some Days in this Confinement, mel∣ancholy
enough: My Ignorance of the
Destiny of <HI>Sydimiris</HI> gave me more Pain than
the Sense of my own Misfortunes; and one
Evening, when I was more then usually dis∣quieted,
one of my Guard entered my Prison,
and, giving me a Letter, retired, without speak∣ing
a Word: I opened this Letter with Preci∣pitation,
and, by the Light of a Lamp which
was allowed me, I read the following Words.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD><HI>Sydimiris,</HI> To the most generous <HI>Bellmour.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is not enough to tell you, that the Method
you took to free me from my Brother's Se∣verity,
has filled me with the utmost Esteem
and Admiration. So generous an Action merits
a greater Acknowlegement, and I will make no
Scruple to confess, that my Heart is most sen∣sibly
touched by it: Yes, <HI>Bellmour,</HI> I have re∣ceived
this glorious Testimony of your Affec∣tion
with such a Gratitude, as you yourself

<CLOSER><SIGNED>Sydimiris.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>This Letter, Madam, pursued Sir <HI>George,</HI>
being wholly calculated to make me hope
that I was not hated by the Divine <HI>Sydimiris;</HI>
and that she meditated something in my Favour;
I resigned myself up to the most delightful Ex∣pectations.</P>
<P>What! cried I, transported with the Ex∣cess
of my Joy: Does the most admirable <HI>Sy∣dimiris</HI>
condescend to assure me, that I have
touched her Heart? And does she promise
me, that I shall receive some convincing Proof
of her Acknowlegement?</P>
<P>Ah! too happy, and too fortunate <HI>Bellmour,</HI> to
what a glorious Destiny hast thou been re∣served!
And how oughtest thou to adore these
Fetters, that have procured thee the Esteem
of the Divine <HI>Sydimiris!</HI>—</P>
<P>Such, Madam, were the Apprehensions,
which the Billet I had received inspired me
with. I continually flattered myself with the
most pleasing Hopes; and during Three Weeks
longer, in which I heard no more from <HI>Sydi∣miris,</HI>
my Imagination, was wholly filled with
those sweet Thoughts, which her Letter had
made me entertain.</P>
<P>At length, on the Evening of a Day which
I had wholly spent in reading over <HI>Sydimiris</HI>'s
Letter; and interpreting the Sense of it a thou∣sand
different Ways, but all agreeable to my
ardent Wishes; I saw the sage <HI>Urinoe</HI> enter my
<PB N="92" REF="94"/>
Prison, accompanied by <HI>Toxares,</HI> whom I had
not seen during my last Confinement. Wholly
transported at the Sight of these Two Friends,
and not doubting but they had brought me the
most agreeable News, I ran towards them; and,
throwing my self at <HI>Urinoe</HI>'s Feet, I begged her,
in an Ecstacy of Joy, to acquaint me with <HI>Sy∣dimiris</HI>'s
Commands.</P>
<P><HI>Urinoe,</HI> in some Confusion at this Action,
intreated me to rise. 'Tis fit, cried I, in a
Transport I could not master, that in this
Posture I should receive the Knowlege of that
Felicity <HI>Sydimiris</HI> has had the Goodness to
promise me. <HI>Urinoe</HI> sighed at these Words;
and, beholding me with a Look of Compassion
and Tenderness,</P>
<P>Would to God, said she, that all I have to
say, were as agreeable, as the first News I have
to tell you; which is, that you are free, and at
Liberty to leave the Town this Moment! <HI>Sy∣dimiris,</HI>
continued she, has bought your Free∣dom,
at the Expence of her own; and, to de∣liver
you from her Brother's Chains, she has
put on others, haply more cruel than those
you have worn: In fine, she has married a Man,
whom she detested, to procure your Liberty;
her Brother having granted it to her upon that
Condition alone.</P>
<P>Scarce had <HI>Urinoe</HI> finished these Words, when
I fell, without Sense or Motion, at her Feet.
<HI>Toxares</HI> and she, who had foreseen what might
happen, having provided themselves with Cor∣dials
necessary to restore me, brought me to
myself with infinite Trouble.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="95"/>
Cruel! said I to them, with a Tone and
Look, which witnessed the Excess of my
Despair, Why have you hindered me from
dying, at once to prevent the thousand Deaths
I shall suffer from my Grief? Is this the Con∣firmation
of those glorious Hopes <HI>Sydimiris</HI> had
permitted me to entertain? Is this that Proof
of the Acknowlegements I was to expect? And
is it by throwing herself into the Arms of my
Rival, that she repays those Obligations she
thinks she owes me?</P>
<P>Ah! inhuman <HI>Sydimiris!</HI> was it to make
my Despair more poignant, that thou flatterest
me with such a Prospect of Happiness? And
was it necessary, to the Grandeur of thy Nup∣tials,
that my Life should be the Sacrifice?</P>
<P>But, how unjust am I, cried I, repenting in
an Instant of those injurious Suspicions; How
unjust am I, to accuse the Divine <HI>Sydimiris</HI> of
Inhumanity? Was it not to give me Freedom,
that she bestowed herself upon a Man she
hates? And has she not made herself miserable
for ever, to procure me a fansied Happiness?</P>
<P>Ah! if it be so, what a Wretch am I? I,
who have been the only Cause of that Misery,
to which she has doomed herself? Ah! Liberty!
pursued I, how I detest thee, since purchased
by the Misfortune of <HI>Sydimiris!</HI> And how far
more sweet and glorious were those Chains,
which I wore for her sake!</P>
<P>My Sighs and Tears leaving me no longer
the Power of Speech, I sunk down on my Bed,
oppress'd with a mortal Grief.</P>
<P><HI>Urinoe</HI> and <HI>Toxares</HI> drew near to comfort me,
<PB N="94" REF="96"/>
and said all that sensible and discreet Persons
could think of to alleviate my Despair.</P>
<P>Though I have heard that <HI>Sydimiris</HI> is mar∣ried,
replied I, without dying immediately;
yet do not imagine, that I will suffer this odious
Life to continue long. If Sorrow do not quickly
dispatch me, I will seek Death by other Means;
for since <HI>Sydimiris</HI> is lost, I have no more Busi∣ness
in the World.</P>
<P>The charitable <HI>Urinoe</HI> and <HI>Toxares</HI> endea∣voured
in vain to divert me from this sad Re∣solution,
when <HI>Urinoe,</HI> finding all their Reason∣ings
ineffectual, drew a Letter out of her Pocket,
and, presenting it to me, I had Orders, said
she, not to let this Letter be delivered to you,
till you had left the Town; but the Despair,
to which I see you reduced, does, I conceive,
dispense with my rigorous Observation of those
Directions.</P>
<P>While <HI>Urinoe</HI> was speaking, I opened this
Letter trembling, and found it as follows.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Sydimiris,</HI> To <HI>Bellmour.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IF that Proof of my Gratitude, which I pro∣mised
to give you, fall short of your Ex∣pectations;
blame not the Defect of my Will,
but the Rigour of my Destiny: It was by this
<PB N="95" REF="97"/>
only Way I could give you Liberty; nor is it
too dearly bought by the Loss of all my Hap∣piness,
if you receive it as you ought: Had I
been allowed to follow my own Inclinations,
there is no Man in the World I would have
preferred to yourself. I owe this Confession to
the Remembrance of your Affection, of which
you gave me so generous an Instance; and the
Use I expect you will make of it, is, to console
you under a Misfortune, which is common to
us both; though I haply have most Reason to
complain, since I could not be just to you,
without being cruel at the same time, or con∣fer
a Benefit, without loading you with a Mis∣fortune.
If the Sacrifice I have made of myself
for your sake, gives me any Claim to the Con∣tinuance
of your Love, I command you, by
the Power it gives me over you, to live, and
not add to the Miseries of my Condition, the
Grief of being the Cause of your Death. Re∣member,
I will look upon your Disobedience,
as an Act of the most cruel Ingratitude; and
your Compliance with this Request shall ever
be esteemed, as the dearest Mark you can give
of that Passion you have borne to the unfor∣tunate</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Sydimiris.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Ah! <HI>Sydimiris,</HI> cried I, having read this
Letter, more cruel in your Kindness than Se∣verity!
After having deprived me of yourself,
do you forbid me to die; and expose me by so
rigorous a Command to Ills infinitely more
hard and painful than Death?</P>
<P>Yes, pursued I, after a little Pause; yes, <HI>Sy∣dimiris,</HI>
<PB N="96" REF="98"/>
thou shalt be obeyed; we will not dye,
since thou hast commanded us to live; and,
notwithstanding the Tortures to which thou
condemnest us, we will obey this Command;
and give thee a glorious Proof of our present
Submission, by enduring that Life, which the
Loss of thee has rendered truly wretched.</P>
<P><HI>Urinoe</HI> and <HI>Toxares,</HI> somewhat reassured, by
the Resolution I had taken, exhorted me by all
the Persuasions, Friendship could put in their
Mouths, to persevere in it; and, <HI>Urinoe</HI> bid∣ding
me Farewel, I endeavoured to prevail upon
her to procure me a Sight of <HI>Sydimiris</HI> once
more, or at least to bear a Letter from me to
her; but she refused both these Requests so
obstinately, telling me, <HI>Sydimiris</HI> would neither
consent to the one nor the other, that I was oblig∣ed
to be contented with the Promise she made
me, to represent my Affliction in a true Light
to her Mistress; and to assure her, that nothing
but her absolute Commands could have hin∣dered
me from dying. Then, taking leave of
me with much Tenderness, she went out of
tbe Prison, leaving <HI>Toxares</HI> with me, who as∣sisted
me to dress, and conducted me out of
that miserable Place, where I had passed so many
sad, and also joyful Hours. At a Gate to which
he brought me, I found a Horse waiting; and,
having embraced this faithful Confidant, with
many Expressions of Gratitude, I bestowed a
Ring of some Value upon him to remember me
by; and, mounting my Horse, with a breaking
Heart, I took the first Road which presented
itself to my Eyes, and galloped away, without
knowing whither I went. I rode the whole
<PB N="97" REF="99"/>
Night, so totally engrossed by my Despair, that
I did not perceive my Horse was so tired, it
could hardly carry me a Step farther: At last
the poor Beast fell down under me, so that I
was obliged to dismount; and, looking about
me, perceived I was in a Forest, without see∣ing
the least Appearance of any Habitation.</P>
<P>The Wilderness, and Solitude of the Place,
flattered my Despair, and while my Horse was
feeding upon what Grass he could find, I wan∣dered
about: The Morning just breaking, gave
me Light enough to direct my Steps. Chance
at last conducted me to a Cave, which seemed
to have been the Residence of some Hermit, or
unfortunate Lover like myself. It was dug at
the Side of a Rock, the Entrance to it thick
set with Bushes, which hid it from View. I
descended by a few Steps cut rudely enough,
and was convinced, it had formerly served for
a Habitation for some religious or melan∣choly
Person; for there were Seats of Turf
raised on each Side of it, a kind of Bed com∣posed
of dried Leaves and Rushes, and a Hole
made artificially at the Top, to admit the Light.</P>
<P>While I considered this Place attentively,
I all at once took up a Resolution, inspired by
my Despair; which was, to continue there,
and indulge my Melancholy in a Retirement
so fitted for my Purpose.</P>
<P>Giving my Horse therefore Liberty to go
where he pleased, and hanging up my Arms
upon a Tree near my Cave, I took Possession
of this solitary Mansion, with a gloomy Kind
of Satisfaction, and devoted all my Hours to
the Contemplation of my Misfortunes.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="100"/>
I lived in this manner, Madam, for Ten
Months, without feeling the least Desire to
change my Habitation; and, during all that
time, no Mortal approached my Solitude, so
that I lived perfectly secure and undiscovered.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George</HI> pausing here to take Breath, the
old Baronet said what will be found in the
following Chapter.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A single Combat fought with prodigious
Valour, and described with amazing
Accuracy.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>GIVE me Leave, Sir, said Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> to
ask, If you eat in all this Time?</P>
<P>Alas! Sir, replied Sir <HI>George,</HI> Sighs and Tears
were all my Sustenance.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> and Miss, laugh∣ing
at this Answer, <HI>Arabella</HI> seemed greatly con∣fused:</P>
<P>It is not to be imagined, said she, that Sir
<HI>George;</HI> or, to say better, Prince <HI>Viridmore,</HI> lived
Ten Months without eating any thing to support
Nature; but such trifling Circumstances are
always left out, in the Relations of Histories;
and truly an Audience must be very dull and
unapprehensive, that cannot conceive, without
being told, that a Man must necessarily eat in
the Space of Ten Months.</P>
<P>But the Food Sir <HI>George</HI> lived on, replied
the Baronet, was very unsubstantial, and would
not afford him much Nourishment.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="101"/>
I suppose, resumed <HI>Arabella,</HI> he lived upon
such Provisions as the Forest afforded him; such as
wild Fruits, Herbs, bitter Sallads, and the
like; which, considering the Melancholy that
possessed him, would appear a voluptuous Re∣past;
and which the unfortunate <HI>Orontes,</HI>
when he was in the same Situation, thought
infinitely too good for him.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> finding <HI>Arabella</HI> took no Notice
of the Historian's Hyperbole of living upon his
Sighs and Tears, passed it over, for fear of of∣fending
her; and Sir <HI>George,</HI> who had been in
some Anxiety how to bring himself off, when
he perceived <HI>Arabella</HI> was reasonable enough
to suppose he must have eat during his Abode
in the Forest, went on with his Relation in
this Manner.</P>
<P>I lived, as I before observed to you, Ma∣dam,
in this Cave for Ten Months; and truly
I was so reconciled to that solitary way of Life,
and found so much Sweetness in it, that I be∣lieve,
I should have remained there till this
Day, but for the Adventure which I am going
to recount.</P>
<P>It being my Custom to walk out every Even∣ing
in the Forest; returning to my Cave,
something later then usual, I heard the Cries
of a Woman at some Distance, who seemed to
be in Distress: I stopped to listen from what
Side those Cries proceeded; and perceiving
they seemed to approach nearer to me, I took
down my Armour from the Tree where I had
hung it; and hastily arming myself, shaped my
Course towards the Place from whence those
<PB N="100" REF="102"/>
Complaints seemed to come, resolving to assist
that unknown Person with all the Strength
that was left me.</P>
<P>Having gone some Paces, I spied through
the Branches of the Trees a Man on Horse∣back
with a Lady, who struggled to get loose,
and at times calling aloud for Succour.</P>
<P>This Sight inflaming me with Rage against
that impious Ravisher; I flew towards him:
And when I came within hearing;</P>
<P>Hold, Wretch! cried I, and cease to offer
Violence to that Lady, whom thou bearest
away by Force; or prepare to defend thyself
against one, who will die, before he will suffer
thee to prosecute thy unjust Designs.</P>
<P>The Man, without answering me, clapped
Spurs to his Horse; and it would have been
impossible to have overtaken him, had not my
own Horse, which had never quitted the Forest,
appeared in my View: I quickly mounted him,
and followed the Track the Ravisher had taken,
with such Speed, that I came up with him in a
Moment.</P>
<P>Caitiff! said I, release the Lady, and de∣fend
thyself. These Words, which I accom∣panied
with a thundering Blow upon his
Head-piece, obliged him to set down the Lady,
who implored Heaven, with the utmost Ar∣dour,
to grant me the Victory: And, recoiling
back a few Paces, to take a View of me,</P>
<P>I know not, said he, for what Reason thou
settest thyself to oppose my Designs; but I
well know, that thou shalt dearly repent of thy
Temerity.</P>
<P>Saying this, he advanced furiously towards
<PB N="101" REF="103"/>
me, and aimed so heavy a Blow at my Head,
that, had I not received it on my Shield, I
might haply have no longer been in a Condi∣tion
to defend the distressed Lady: But, hav∣ing,
with the greatest Dexterity imaginable,
avoided this Blow, I made at him with so
much Fierceness, and directed my Aims so
well, that in a few Moments I wounded him
in several Places; and his Arms were all dyed
with his Blood.</P>
<P>This good Success redoubled my Vigour;
and having, by a lucky Stroke with my Sword,
cut the Strings of his Head-piece, it fell off:
And his Head being bare, I was going to let
fall a dreadful Blow upon it, which doubtles<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
would have shivered it in a thousand Pieces,
when he cried out for Quarter, and, letting fall
his Sword, by that Action assured me my Vi∣ctory
was intire.</P>
<P>Live Wretch, cried I, since thou art base
enough to value Life after being vanquished;
but swear upon my Sword, that thou wilt ne∣ver
more attempt the Liberty of that Lady.</P>
<P>While I was speaking, I perceived he was
no longer able to sit his Horse: But, staggering
a Moment, he fell off, and lay extended with∣out
Motion upon the Ground. Touched with
Compassion at this Sight, I alighted, and, sup∣posing
him to be in a Swoon, was preparing to
give him some Assistance; but, upon my nearer
Approach, I found he was quite dead.</P>
<P>Leaving therefore this mournful Object, I
I turned about, with an Intention to go and
offer the distressed Lady my further Help; but
I perceived her already at my Feet.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="104"/>
Valiant Knight, said she, with a Tone of
Voice so bewitching, that all my Faculties
were suspended, as by Inchantment, suffer
me, on my Knees, to thank you, for the De∣liverance
you have procured me from that base
Man; since to your admirable Valour I owe
not only the Preservation of my Life; but,
what is infinitely dearer to me, my Honour.</P>
<P>The Astonishment, wherewith I beheld the
miraculous Beauty that appeared before me,
kept me a Moment in such an attentive Gaze,
that I forgot she was at my Feet: Recollecting
myself, however, with some Confusion at my
Neglect,</P>
<P>Oh! rise, Madam, cried I, helping her up
with infinite Respect, and debase not such Per∣fection
to a Posture, in which all the Mon∣archs
on the Earth might glory to appear be∣fore
it.</P>
<P>That you may the better conceive the Al∣teration
which the Sight of this fair Unknown
produced in my Soul, I will endeavour, to
give you a Description of her Beauty, which
was altogether miraculous.</P>

<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which the Reader will find a Description
of a Beauty, in a Style truly sublime.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE new-fallen Snow, pursued Sir <HI>George,</HI>
was tanned, in Comparison of the refin∣ed
Purity of that White which made up the
<PB N="103" REF="105"/>
Ground of her Complexion; and, though Fear
had a little gathered the Carnations of her
Cheeks, yet her Joy at being delivered
seemed to plant them there with such fresh
Advantages, that my Eye might shrink at the
Brightness of that mingled Lustre: Her Mouth,
as well for Shape as Colour, might shame the
Imitation of the best Pencils, and the liveliest
Tints; and though through some petty Inter∣vals
of Joy, it wanted the Smiles, which Grief
and Terror sequestred, yet she never opened it,
but like the East, at the Birth of a beautiful
Day, and then discovered Treasures, whose ex∣celling
Whiteness made the Price inestimable:
All the Features of her Face had so near a
Kindred to Proportion and Symmetry, as the
several Masters of <HI>Apelles</HI>'s Art might have
called it his Glory to have copied Beauties from
her, as the best of Models: The Circumfe∣rence
of her Visage shewed the Extremes of
an imperfect Circle, and almost formed it to a
perfect Oval: And this Abridgment of Mar∣vels
was tapered by a Pair of the brightest
Stars, that ever were lighted up by the Hand
of Nature: As their Colour was the same with
the Heavens, there was a spherical Harmony
in their Motion; and that mingled with a Vi∣vacity
so penetrating, as neither the firmest
Eye, nor the strongest Soul, could arm them∣selves
with a Resistance of Proof against those
pointed Glories: Her Head was crowned with
a prodigious Quantity of fair long Hair, which
Colour as fitly suited the Beauty of her Eyes,
as Imagination could make it: To these Mar∣vels
of Face were joined the rest of her Neck,
<PB N="104" REF="106"/>
Hands, and Shape; and there seemed a Contest
between the Form and Whiteness of the two
former, which had the largest Commission from
Nature to work Wonders.</P>
<P>In fine, her Beauty was miraculous, and
could not fail of producing a sudden Effect
upon a Heart like mine.</P>
<P>Having passed in an Instant from the ex∣tremest
Admiration, to something yet more
tender, I reiterated my Offers of Service to
the fair Unknown; who told me, she feared her
Father had Occasion for some Assistance, her
Ravisher having left his Men to engage him, and
keep off his Pursuit, while he rode off with
his Prize: Hereupon I begg'd her to direct me
to the Place where she left her Father, assuring
her I would gladly venture my Life a Second
time, to preserve his; and she desiring to go
with me, I placed her before me on my Horse,
and had the exquisite Pleasure of supporting
with my Arms the fairest and most admirable
Creature in the World.</P>
<P>In less than half an Hour, which had ap∣peared
to me but a Moment, we got to the
Place where she had been torn from her Father;
whom we beheld with three of his Servants,
maintaining a Fight against twice as many of
their Enemies.</P>
<P>Having gently set down the beauteous Un∣known
upon the Grass, I flew to the Relief
of her Father; and, throwing myself furiously
amongst his Assailants, dispatched two of them
with so many Blows: The others, seeing so un∣expected
an Assistance, gave back a little; and
<PB N="105" REF="107"/>
I took Advantage of their Consternation, to
redouble my Blows, and brought Two more
of them at my Feet.</P>
<P>There remained now but Four to overcome;
and my Arrival having given new Vigour to
those whose Part I had taken, they seconded
me so well, that we soon had nothing more left
to do; for the rest, seeing their Comrades slain,
sought their Safety in Flight: We were too
generous to pursue them, the Blood of such
Wretches being unworthy to be shed by our
Swords.</P>
<P>The fair Unknown, seeing us Conquerors,
flew to embrace her Father; who, holding her
pressed between his Arms, turned his Eyes upon
me; then quitting her, came towards me, and,
in the most obliging Terms imaginable, re∣turned
me Thanks for the Assistance I had
brought him; and being informed by his
Daughter, of what I had done for her Preser∣vation,
this old Gentleman renewed his Ac∣knowlegements,
calling me the Preserver of
his Life, the valiant Defender of his Daugh∣ter's
Honour, his tutelary Angel, and the
Guardian of his House.</P>
<P>In fine, he loaded me with so many Thanks
and Praises, that I could not choose but be in
some Confusion; and, to put an End to them, I
begged he would inform me, by what means
he came into that Misfortune.</P>
<P>He told me, that, residing in a Castle at the
Extremity of this Forest, the Charms of his
Daughter had captivated a neighbouring Lord,
whose Character and Person being disagreeable
<PB N="106" REF="108"/>
both to her and himself, he had absolutely re∣fused
to give her to him: Thereupon he had set
upon them as they were going to visit a Rela∣tion
at some Distance, and, dragging <HI>Philonice</HI>
out of the Coach, put her before him on his
Horse, and carried her away, leaving Eight of
his Men to engage him, and his Servants; who,
being but Four in Number, must inevitably
have perished, had I not come to his Relief,
and, by my miraculous Valour, vanquished all
his Enemies.</P>
<P>Saying this, he desired me to go home with
him to the Castle; and having led his Daugh∣ter
to the Coach, insisted upon my placing my∣self
next her; and, getting in himself, ordered
them to return home.</P>
<P>This Accident having altered his Design of
making the Visit which had been the Occasion
of his Journey;</P>
<P>The Baron, for that I found was his Title,
entertained me, all the Way, with repeated Ex∣pressions
of Acknowledgements and Tenderness;
and the incomparable <HI>Philonice</HI> condescended
also to assure me of her Gratitude for the Ser∣vice
I had done her.</P>
<P>At our Arrival at the Castle, I perceived it
was very large and magnificent: The Baron con∣ducted
me to one of the best Apartments, and
would stay in the Room till my Armour was
taken off, that he might be assured I had re∣ceived
no Hurts: Having rendered him the like
Civility in his own Chamber, and satisfied
myself he was not wounded, we returned to
the beautiful <HI>Philonice;</HI> and this second Sight
<PB N="107" REF="109"/>
having finished my Defeat, I remained so ab∣solutely
her Slave, that neither <HI>Dorothea</HI> nor
<HI>Sydimiris</HI> were more passionately beloved.</P>
<P>At the earnest Intreaty of the Baron, I staid
some Weeks in the Castle; during which, the
daily Sight of <HI>Philonice</HI> so augmented my
Flames, that I was no longer in a Condition to
conceal them; but, fearing to displease that Di∣vine
Beauty by a Confession of my Passion, I
languished in secret; and the Constraint I laid
upon myself, gave me such Torments, that I
fell into a profound Melancholy, and looked
so pale and dejected, that the Baron was sensi∣ble
of the Alteration, and conjured me in the
most pressing Terms, to acquaint him with the
Cause of my Uneasiness: But though I conti∣nued
obstinately silent with my Tongue, yet
my Eyes spoke intelligibly enough; and the
Blushes which appeared in the fair Cheeks
of <HI>Philonice,</HI> whenever she spoke to me on the
Subject of my Grief, convinced me she was
not ignorant of my Passion.</P>
<P>At length the Agitation of my Mind throw∣ing
me into a Fever, the Baron, who was firmly
persuaded, that my Illness proceeded from some
concealed Vexation, pressed me continually to
declare myself; and, finding all his Intreaties
ineffectual, he commanded his Daughter to en∣deavour
to find out the Cause of that Grief
which had put me into such a Condition.</P>
<P>For that Purpose therefore, having brought
the fair <HI>Philonice</HI> into my Chamber, he staid a
few Minutes, and, leaving the Room, under
Pretence of Business, <HI>Philonice</HI> remained alone
<PB N="108" REF="110"/>
by my Bedside, her Women, out of Respect,
staying at the other End of the Chamber.</P>
<P>This Divine Person, seeing herself alone with
me, and remembring her Father's Command,
blushed, and cast down her Eyes in such appa∣rent
Confusion, that I could not help observing
it: And, interpreting it to the Displeasure she
took in being so near me,</P>
<P>Whatever Joy I take in the Honour your
Visit does me, Madam, said I, in a weak Voice;
yet since nothing is so dear to me, as your Sa∣tisfaction,
I would rather dispense with this
Mark of your Goodness to an unfortunate
Wretch, then see you in the least Constraint.</P>
<P>And why, replied she, with a Tone full of
Sweetness, do you suppose that I am here by
Constraint, when it would be more just to be∣lieve,
that in visiting the valiant Defender of
my Honour, and the Life of my Father, I only
follow my own Inclinations?</P>
<P>Ah! Madam, said I, transported with Joy
at so favourable a Speech, the little Service I
had the Happiness to do you, does not merit
so infinite a Favour; and tho' I had lost the best
Part of my Blood in your Defence, I should
have been well rewarded with your Safety.</P>
<P>Since you do not repent of what you have
done, replied she, I am willing to be obliged
to you for another Favour; and ask it with the
greater Hope of obtaining it, as I must acquaint
you, it is by my Father's Command I take
that Liberty, who is much interested in my
Success.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="111"/>
There is no Occasion, Madam, returned I,
to make use of any Interest but your own, to
engage me to obey you, since that is, and ever
will be, all-powerful with me: Speak then,
Madam, and let me know what it is you desire
of me, that I may, once in my Life, have the
Glory of obeying you.</P>
<P>It is, said she, blushing still more than before,
that you will acquaint us with the Cause of that
Melancholy, which has, as we imagine, occa∣sioned
your present Illness.</P>
<P>At these Words I trembled, turned pale; and,
not daring to discover the true Cause of my
Affliction, I remained in a profound Silence.</P>
<P>I see, said the beautiful <HI>Philonice,</HI> that you
have no Inclination to obey me; and since my
Request has, as I perceive, given you some
Disturbance, I will prevail upon my Father to
press you no farther upon this Subject.</P>
<P>No, Madam, said I, eagerly; the Baron shall
be satisfied, and you shall be obeyed; though,
after the Knowlege of my Crime, you doom
me to that Death I so justly merit.</P>
<P>Yes Madam, this unfortunate Man, who has
had the Glory to acquire your Esteem by the
little Service he did you, has cancelled the Me∣rit
of that Service by daring to adore you.</P>
<P>I love you, divine <HI>Philonice;</HI> and, not being
able either to repent, or cease to be guilty of
loving you, I am resolved to die, and spare
you the Trouble of pronouncing my Sentence.
I beseech you therefore to believe, that I would
have died in Silence, but for your Command
to declare myself, and you should never have
<PB N="110" REF="112"/>
known the Excess of my Love and Despair,
had not my Obedience to your Will obliged
me to confess it.</P>
<P>I finished these Words with so much Fear
and Confusion, that I durst not lift my Eyes
up to the fair Face of <HI>Philonice,</HI> to observe how
she received this Discourse: I waited therefore,
trembling, for her Answer; but finding that in
several Minutes she spoke not a Word, I ven∣tured
at last, to cast a languishing Glance upon
the Visage I adored, and saw so many Marks
of Disorder upon it, that I was almost dead
with the Apprehensions of having offended her
beyond even the Hope of procuring her Pardon
by my Death.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Wherein Sir George concludes his History;
which produces an unexpected Effect.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Silence of <HI>Philonice,</HI> continued Sir
<HI>George,</HI> pierced me to the Heart; and
when I saw her rise from her Seat, and prepare
to go away without speaking, Grief took such
Possession of my Spirits, that, uttering a Cry, I
fell into a Swoon, which, as I afterwards was
informed, greatly alarmed the beautiful <HI>Philo∣nice;</HI>
who, resuming her Seat, had the Good∣ness
to assist her Women in bringing me to
myself; and, when I opened my Eyes, I had
<PB N="111" REF="113"/>
the Satisfaction to behold her still by me, and
all the Signs of Compassion in her Face.</P>
<P>This Sight a little re-assuring me; I ask your
Pardon, Madam, said I, for the Condition in
which I have appeared before you, and also for
that I am not yet dead, as is doubtless your
Wish: But I will make Haste, pursued I,
sighing, to fulfil your Desires; and you shall
soon be freed from the Sight of a miserable
Wretch, who, to his last Moment, will not
cease to adore you.</P>
<P>It is not your Death that I desire, said the
fair <HI>Philonice;</HI> and, after having preserved both
my Father and me from Death, it is not rea∣sonable,
that we should suffer you to die, if we
can help it.</P>
<P>Live therefore, <HI>Bellmour,</HI> pursued she, blush∣ing;
and live, if possible, without continuing in
that Weakness I cannot choose but condemn:
Yet whatever are your Thoughts for the future,
remember that your Death will be a Fault I
cannot resolve to pardon.</P>
<P>Speaking these Words, without giving me
time to answer, she left my Chamber; and I
found something so sweet and favourable in
them, that I resolved to obey her, and forward
my Cure as much as I was able: However, the
Agitation of Spirits increased my Fever so
much, that my Life was despaired of.</P>
<P>The Baron hardly ever left my Bedside.
<HI>Philonice</HI> came every Day to see me, and seemed
extremely moved at the Danger I was in. One
Day, when I was worse than usual, she came
<PB N="112" REF="114"/>
close to the Bedside; and, opening the Cour∣tain,</P>
<P>What <HI>Bellmour,</HI> said she, do you pay so
little Obedience to my Commands, that you
resolve to die?</P>
<P>Heaven is my Witness, Madam, said I,
faintly, that nothing is so dear and sacred to
me as your Commands; and since, out of your
superlative Goodness, you are pleased to have
some Care for my Life, I would preserve it to
obey you, were it in my Power; but, alas!
Madam, I strive in vain to repel the Violence
of my Distemper.</P>
<P>In a few Days more, I was reduced to the
last Extremity: It was then that the fair <HI>Phi∣lonice</HI>
discovered, that she did not hate me; for
she made no Scruple to weep before me; and
those Tears she so liberally shed, had so pow∣erful
an Effect upon my Mind, that the Con∣tentment
I felt, communicated itself to my
Body, and gave such a Turn to my Distemper,
that my Recovery was not only hoped, but ex∣pected.</P>
<P>The Baron expressed his Satisfaction at this
Alteration, by the most affectionate Expres∣sions;
and though the fair <HI>Philonice</HI> said very
little, yet I perceived by the Joy that appeared
in her fair Eyes, that she was not less interested
in my Recovery, than her Father.</P>
<P>The Physicians having declared me out of
Danger, the Baron, who had taken his Re∣solutions
long before, came one Day into my
Chamber; and ordering those who attended me,
to leave us alone,</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="115"/>
Prince, said he, for in recounting my History
to him, I had disclosed my true Quality, I am
not ignorant of that Affection you bear my
Daughter; and am sensible it has occasioned
the Extremity to which we have seen you re∣duced:
Had you been pleased to acquaint me
with your Sentiments, you would have avoided
those Displeasures you have suffered; for though
your Birth were not so illustrious as it is, yet,
preferring Virtue to all other Advantages, I
should have esteemed my Daughter honou∣red
by your Love, and have freely bestowed
her on you: But since to those rare Qualities
wherewith Heaven has so liberally endowed
you, you add also that of a Birth so noble,
doubt not but I shall think myself highly fa∣voured
by your Alliance: If therefore your
Thoughts of my Daughter be not changed,
and you esteem her worthy to be your Bride, I
here solemnly promise you to bestow her upon
you, as soon as you are perfectly recovered.</P>
<P>I leave you to guess, Madam, the Joy which
I felt at this Discourse: It was so great, that
it would not permit me to thank him, as I
should have done, for the inestimable Blessing
he bestowed on me.</P>
<P>I saw <HI>Philonice</HI> a few Minutes after; and, being
commanded by her Father to give me her Hand,
she did so, without any Marks of Reluctance,
and, having respectfully kissed it, I vowed to be
her Slave for ever.</P>
<P>Who would have imagined, continued Sir
<HI>George,</HI> with a profound Sigh, that Fortune,
while she thus seemed to flatter me, was pre∣paring
to make me suffer the severest Tor∣ments?
<PB N="114" REF="116"/>
I began now to leave my Bed, and was
able to walk about my Chamber. The Baron
was making great Preparations for our Nuptials;
when one Night I was alarmed with the Cries
of <HI>Philonice</HI>'s Women; and, a few Moments
after, the Baron came into my Chamber, with
a distracted Air.</P>
<P>O! Son, cried he, for so he always called
me, now <HI>Philonice</HI> is lost both to you and me:
She is carried off by Force, and I am preparing
to follow and rescue her, if possible; but I fear
my Endeavours will be fruitless, since I know
not which Way her Ravishers have taken.</P>
<P>Oh! Sir, cried I, transported both with Grief
and Rage, you shall not go alone: Her Rescue
belongs to me; and I will effect it, or perish in
the Attempt.</P>
<P>The Baron, having earnestly conjured me
not to expose myself to the Danger of a Re∣lapse,
by so imprudent a Resolution, was ob∣liged
to quit me, Word being brought him, that
his Horse was ready: And as soon as he was
gone out of the Room, in spite of all that could
be said to prevent me, by my Attendants, I
made them put on my Armour; and, mounting
a Horse I had caused to be made ready, fallied
furiously out of the Castle, breathing out Vows
of Vengeance against the Wretch who had
robbed me of <HI>Philonice.</HI></P>
<P>I rode the whole Night without stopping.
Day appeared, when I found myself near a
small Village. I entered it, and made strict
Enquiry after the Ravisher of <HI>Philonice,</HI> de∣scribing
the fair Creature, and offering vast Re∣wards
to any who could bring me the least In∣telligence
<PB N="115" REF="117"/>
of her: But all was in vain; I could
make no Discovery.</P>
<P>After travelling several Days, to no Purpose,
I returned to the Castle, in order to know if
the Baron had been more successful in his Pur∣suit
then myself; but I found him oppressed
with Grief: He had heard no Tidings of his
Daughter, and had suffered no small Appre∣hensions
upon my Account. Having assured
him I found myself very able to travel, I took
an affectionate Leave of him, promising him
never to give over my Search, till I had found
the Divine <HI>Philonice:</HI> But Heaven has not per∣mitted
me that Happiness; and though I have
spent several Years in searching for her, I have
never been able to discover where she is: Time
has not cured me of my Grief for her Loss;
and, though by an Effect of my Destiny,
another Object possesses my Soul, yet I do
not cease to deplore her Misfortune, and to of∣fer
up Vows for her Happiness.</P>
<P>And is this all you have to say? said <HI>Ara∣bella,</HI>
whom the latter Part of his History had
extremely surprised; or are we to expect a
Continuance of your Adventures?</P>
<P>I have faithfully related all my Adventures,
that are worthy your Hearing, Madam, re∣turned
Sir <HI>George;</HI> and I flatter myself, you
will do me the Justice to own, that I have
been rather unfortunate than faithless; and that
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> had little Reason to tax me with
Inconstancy.</P>
<P>In my Opinion, resumed <HI>Arabella,</HI> Mr.
<HI>Glanville</HI> spoke too favourably of you, when he
called you only inconstant; and if he had add∣ed
<PB N="116" REF="118"/>
the Epithet of Ungrateful and Unjust, he
would have marked your Character better.</P>
<P>For, in fine, Sir, pursued she, you will ne∣ver
persuade any reasonable Person, that your
being able to lose the Remembrance of the fair
and generous <HI>Sydimiris,</HI> in your new Passion for
<HI>Philonice,</HI> was not an Excess of Levity: But
your suffering so tamely the Loss of this last
Beauty, and allowing her to remain in the
Hands of her Ravisher, while you permit an∣other
Affection to take Possession of your Soul,
is such an Outrage to all Truth and Constancy,
that you deserve to be ranked among the falsest
of Mankind.</P>
<P>Alas! Madam, replied Sir <HI>George,</HI> who had
not foreseen the Influence <HI>Arabella</HI> would draw
from this last Adventure, What would you
have an unfortunate Man, whose Hopes have
been so often, and so cruelly, disappointed, do?
I have bewailed the Loss of <HI>Philonice,</HI> with a
Deluge of Tears; I have taken infinite Pains to
find her, but to no Purpose; and when Hea∣ven
compassionating my Sufferings, presented
to my Eyes, an Object, to whom the whole
World ought to pay Adoration, how could I
resist that powerful Impulse, which forced me to
love what appeared so worthy of my Affection?</P>
<P>Call not, interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> that an ir∣resistible
Impulse, which was only the Effect
of thy own changing Humour: The same Ex∣cuse
might be pleaded for all the Faults we see
committed in the World; and Men would no
longer be answerable for their own Crimes.
Had you imitated the illustrious Heroes of An∣tiquity,
as well in the Constancy of their Af∣fections,
<PB N="117" REF="119"/>
as, it must be confessed, you have done
in their admirable Valour; you would now be
either sighing in your Cave for the Loss of the
generous <HI>Sydimiris,</HI> or wandering through the
World in Search of the beautiful <HI>Philonice.</HI>
Had you persevered in your Affection, and con∣tinued
your Pursuit of that Fair-one; you
would, perhaps, ere this, have found her sleep∣ing
under the Shade of a Tree in some lone Fo∣rest,
as <HI>Philodaspes</HI> did his admirable <HI>Delia,</HI> or
disguised in a Slave's Habit, as <HI>Ariobarsanes</HI> saw
his Divine <HI>Olympia;</HI> or bound haply in a Cha∣riot,
and have had the Glory of freeing her, as
<HI>Ambriomer</HI> did the beauteous <HI>Agione;</HI> or in a
Ship in the Hands of Pirates, like the incom∣parable
<HI>Eliza;</HI> or—</P>
<P>Enough, dear Niece, interrupted Sir <HI>Charles;</HI>
you have quoted Examples sufficient, if this in∣constant
Man would have the Grace to follow
them.</P>
<P>True, Sir, replied <HI>Arabella;</HI> and I would
recommend to his Consideration the Conduct
of those illustrious Persons I have named, to the
end that, pursuing their Steps, he may arrive
at their Glory and Happiness, that is the Repu∣tation
of being perfectly constant, and the Pos∣session
of his Mistress: And be assured, Sir, pur∣sued
<HI>Arabella,</HI> looking at Sir <HI>George,</HI> that Hea∣ven
will never restore you the Crown of your
Ancestors, and place you upon the Throne to
which you pretend, while you make yourself
unworthy of its Protection, by so shameful an
Inconstancy.</P>
<P>I perhaps speak with too much Freedom to a
great Prince; whom though Fortune has de∣spoiled
<PB N="118" REF="120"/>
of his Dominions, is intitled to a certain
Degree of Respect: But I conceive, it belongs
to me, in a particular manner, to resent the
Baseness of that Crime, to which you are pleas∣ed
to make me the Excuse; and, looking upon
myself, as dishonoured by those often prostituted
Vows you have offered me, I am to tell you,
that I am highly disobliged; and forbid you to
appear in my Presence again, till you have re∣sumed
those Thoughts, which are worthy your
noble Extraction; and are capable of treating
me with that Respect, that is my Due.</P>
<P>Saying this, she rose from he Seat, and walk∣ed
very majestically out of the Room, leaving
Sir <HI>George</HI> overwhelmed with Shame and Vexa∣tion
at having conducted the latter Part of his
Narration so ill, and drawn upon himself a
Sentence, which deprived him of all his Hopes.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Containing only a few Inferences, drawn
from the foregoing Chapters.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR. <HI>Glanville,</HI> excessively delighted with
this Event, could not help laughing at
the unfortunate Baronet; who seemed, by his
Silence, and down-cast Looks, to expect it.</P>
<P>Who would have imagined, said he, that so
renowned a Hero would have tarnished the
Glory of his Laurels, as my Cousin says, by so
base an Ingratitude? Indeed, Prince, pursued
he, laughing, you must resolve to recover your
<PB N="119" REF="121"/>
Reputation, either by retiring again to your
Cave, and living upon bitter Herbs, for the
generous <HI>Sydimiris;</HI> or else wander through the
World, in search of the Divine <HI>Philonice.</HI></P>
<P>Don't triumph, dear <HI>Charles,</HI> replied Sir
<HI>George,</HI> laughing in his Turn; have a little
Compassion upon me, and confess, that no∣thing
could be more unfortunate, than that
damn'd Slip I made at the latter End of my
History: But for that, my Reputation for
Courage and Constancy had been as high as
the great <HI>Oroondates,</HI> or <HI>Juba.</HI></P>
<P>Since you have so fertile an Invention, said
Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> you may easily repair this Mistake.
Ods-heart! It is pity you are not poor enough
to be an Author; you would occupy a Garret
in <HI>Grub-street,</HI> with great Fame to yourself,
and Diversion to the Public.</P>
<P>Oh! Sir, cried Sir <HI>George,</HI> I have Stock
enough by me, to set up for an Author To∣morrow,
if I please: I have no less than Five
Tragedies, some quite, others almost finished;
Three or Four Essays on <HI>Virtue, Happiness,</HI> &amp;c.
Three thousand Lines of an Epic Poem; half a
Dozen Epitaphs; a few Acrostics; and a long
String of Puns, that would serve to embellish a
Daily Paper, if I was disposed to write one.</P>
<P>Nay, then, interrupted Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> you
are qualified for a Critic at the <HI>Bedford</HI> Coffee-house;
where, with the rest of your Brothers,
Demy-wits, you may sit in Judgment upon the
Productions of a <HI>Young,</HI> a <HI>R</HI>—, or a <HI>John∣son.</HI>
Rail with premeditated Malice at the
<HI>Rambler;</HI> and, for the want of Faults, turn
even its inimitable Beauties into Ridicule: The
<PB N="120" REF="122"/>
Language, because it reaches to Perfection,
may be called stiff, laboured, and pedantic; the
Criticisms, when they let in more Light than
your weak Judgment can bear, superficial and
ostentatious Glitter; and because those Papers
contain the finest System of Ethics yet extant,
damn the queer Fellow, for over-propping Vir∣tue;
an excellent new Phrase! which those who
can find no Meaning in, may accommodate
with one of their own; then give shrewd Hints,
that some Persons, though they do not publish
their Performances, may have more Merit,
than those that do.</P>
<P>Upon my Soul, <HI>Charles,</HI> said Sir <HI>George,</HI>
thou art such an ill-natured Fellow, that I am
afraid, thou wilt be sneering at me when I am
gone; and wilt endeavour, to persuade Lady
<HI>Bella,</HI> that not a Syllable of my Story is true.
Speak, pursued he, Wilt thou have the Cruelty
to deprive me of my lawful Claim to the great
Kingdom of <HI>Kent;</HI> and rob me of the Glory
of fighting singly against Five hundred Men?</P>
<P>I do not know, said Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> whether
my Niece be really imposed upon, by the Gra∣vity
with which you told your surprising Hi∣story;
but I protest, I thought you were in ear∣nest
at first; and that you meant to make us
believe it all to be Fact.</P>
<P>You are so fitly punished, said Mr. <HI>Glan∣ville,</HI>
for that ill-judged Adventure you related
last, by the bad Opinion Lady <HI>Bella</HI> entertains
of you, that I need not add to your Misfortune:
And therefore, you shall be Prince <HI>Veridomer,</HI> if
you please; since, under that Character, you
<PB N="121" REF="123"/>
are obliged not to pretend to any Lady, but
the incomparable <HI>Philonice.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>George,</HI> who understood his Meaning,
went home, to think of some Means, by which
he might draw himself out of the Embarrass∣ment
he was in; and Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> as he had
promised, did not endeavour to undeceive Lady
<HI>Bella,</HI> with regard to the History he had feign∣ed;
being very well satisfied with his having
put it out of his Power to make his Addresses
to her, since she now looked upon him as the
Lover of <HI>Philonice.</HI></P>
<P>As for Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> he did not penetrate into
the Meaning of Sir <HI>George</HI>'s Story; and only
imagined, that by relating such a Heap of Ad∣ventures,
he had a Design to entertain the
Company, and give a Proof of the Felicity of
his Invention; and Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> who sup∣posed,
he had been ridiculing her Cousin's
strange Notions, was better pleased with him
than ever.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> however, was less satisfied than
any of them: She could not endure to see so
brave a Knight, who drew his Birth from a
Race of Kings, tarnish the Glory of his gallant
Actions by so base a Perfidy.</P>
<P>Alas! said she to herself, How much Rea∣son
has the beautiful <HI>Philonice</HI> to accuse me for
all the Anguish she suffers? since I am the
Cause, that the ungrateful Prince, on whom
she bestows her Affections, suffers her to re∣main
quietly, in the Hands of her Ravisher,
without endeavouring to rescue her: But, Oh!
too lovely, and unfortunate Fair-one, said she,
as if she had been present, and listening to her,
<PB N="122" REF="124"/>
distinguish, I beseech you, between those Faults,
which the Will, and those which Necessity, makes
us commit. I am the Cause, 'tis true, of thy
Lover's Infidelity; but I am the innocent
Cause; and would repair the Evils, my fatal
Beauty gives Rise to, by any Sacrifice in my
Power to make.</P>
<P>While <HI>Arabella,</HI> by her romantic Genero∣sity,
bewails the imaginary Afflictions of the
full as imaginary <HI>Philonice;</HI> Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who
thought the Solitude she lived in, confirmed
her in her absurd and ridiculous Notions, de∣sired

<P>Sir <HI>Charles</HI> complied with his Request, and

<ARGUMENT>
<P>For the Shortness of which the Length

</ARGUMENT>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>IR <HI>George,</HI> to gratify <HI>Arabella</HI>'s
Humour, had not presumed to
come to the Castle for several
Days; but, hearing that they were
preparing to leave the Country,
he wrote a short Billet to her; and in the Style
of Romance, most humbly intreated her to
grant him a Moment's Audience.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> being informed by <HI>Lucy,</HI> to whom Sir
<HI>George</HI>'s Gentleman had addressed himself, that
he had brought a Letter from his Master, she
<PB N="124" REF="126"/>
ordered her to bring him to her Apartment, and
as soon as he appeared,</P>
<P>How comes it, said she, that the Prince your
Master, has had the Presumption to impor∣tune
me again, after my absolute Commands to
the contrary?</P>
<P>The Prince, my Master, Madam, said the
Man, excessively surprised.</P>
<P>Ay! said <HI>Arabella,</HI> Are you not Sir <HI>George</HI>'s
'Squire? And does he not trust you with his
most secret Thoughts?</P>
<P>I belong to Sir <HI>George Bellmour,</HI> Madam,
replied the Man, who did not understand what
She meant: I have not the Honour to be a
'Squire.</P>
<P>No! interrupted <HI>Arabella;</HI> 'tis strange then,
that he should have honoured you with his Com∣mission;
Pray, what is it you come to request
for him?</P>
<P>My Master, Madam, said he, ordered me
to get this Letter delivered to your Ladyship,
and to stay for your Commands.</P>
<P>You would persuade me, said she, sternly,
being provoked that he did not deliver the
Letter upon his Knees, as was the Custom in
Romances, that you are not acquainted with
the Purport of this audacious Billet, since you
express so little Fear of my Displeasure; but
know, presumptuous, that I am mortally
offended with your Master, for his daring to
suppose I would read this Proof at once of
his Insolence and Infidelity; and was you worth
my Resentment, I would haply make you suffer
for your Want of Respect to me.</P>
<P>The poor Man, surprised and confounded at
<PB N="125" REF="127"/>
her Anger, and puzzled extremely; to under∣stand
what she meant, was opening his Mouth
to say something, 'tis probable in his own De∣fence,
when <HI>Arabella,</HI> preventing him,</P>
<P>I know what thou wouldst say, said she:
Thou wouldst abuse my Patience by a false
Detail of thy Master's Sighs, Tears, Excla∣mations,
and Despair.</P>
<P>Indeed, Madam, I don't intend to say any
such Thing, replied the Man.</P>
<P>No! repeated <HI>Arabella,</HI> a little disap∣pointed,
Bear back his presumptuous Billet,
which, I suppose, contains the melancholy Ac∣count;
and tell him, He that could so soon
forget the generous <HI>Sydimiris</HI> for <HI>Philonice,</HI> and
could afterwards be false to that incomparable
Beauty, is not a Person worthy to adore <HI>Arabella.</HI></P>
<P>The Man, who could not tell what to make
of this Message, and feared he should forget
these two hard Names, humbly intreated her
to be pleased to acquaint his Master, by a Line,
with her Intentions. <HI>Arabella,</HI> supposing he
meant to importune her still more, made a
Sign with her Hand, very majestically, for
him to be gone; but he, not able to compre∣hend
her Meaning, stood still, with an Air of
Perplexity, not daring to beg her to explain
herself; supposing, she, by that Sign, required
something of him.</P>
<P>Why dost thou not obey my Commands?
said <HI>Arabella,</HI> finding he did not go.</P>
<P>I will, to be sure, Madam, replied he;
wishing at the same time secretly, she would
let him know what they were.</P>
<P>And yet, said she hastily, thou art disobey∣ing
<PB N="126" REF="128"/>
me this Moment: Did I not bid you get
out of my Presence, and to speak no more
of your inconstant Master, whose Crimes have
rendered him the Detestation of all generous
Persons whatever?</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George</HI>'s Messenger, extremely surprised
at so harsh a Character of his Master, and the
Rage with which the Lady seemed to be actu∣ated,
made haste to get out of her Apartment;
and, at his Return, informed his Master, very
exactly, of the Reception he had met with,
repeating all Lady <HI>Bella</HI>'s Words; which, not∣withstanding
the Blunders he made in the Names
of <HI>Sydimiris</HI> and <HI>Philonice,</HI> Sir <HI>George</HI> under∣stood
well enough; and found new Occasion of
wondering at the Excess of <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Extrava∣gance,
who he never imagined would have ex∣plained
herself in that Manner to his Servant.</P>
<P>Without endeavouring therefore to see <HI>Ara∣bella,</HI>
he went to pay his Compliments to Sir
<HI>Charles,</HI> Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> and Miss <HI>Glanville;</HI> to
the last of which he said some soft things, that
them her extremely regret his staying behind
made in the Country.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Not so long as was first intended; but con∣tains,
however, a surprising Adventure
on the Road.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Day of their Departure being come,
they set out in a Coach and Six, attended
by several Servants on Horseback. The First
<PB N="127" REF="129"/>
Day's Journey passed off, without any Acci∣dent
worthy relating; but, towards the Close of
the Second, they were alarmed by the Ap∣pearance
of three Highwaymen, well mounted,
at a small Distance.</P>
<P>One of the Servants, who had first spied
them, immediately rode up to the Coach; and,
for fear of alarming the Ladies, whispered Mr.
<HI>Glanville</HI> in the Ear.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> who was sitting next his Son, and
had heard it, cried out with too little Caution,
How's this? Are we in any Danger of being at∣tacked,
say you?</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> without replying, jumped
out of the Coach; at which Miss <HI>Glanville</HI>
screamed out; and, lest her Father should fol∣low,
whipped into her Brother's Sear, and held
him fast by the Coat.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> being in a strange Consternation at
all this, put her Head out of the Coach, to see
what was the Matter; and, observing Three or
Four Men of a genteel Appearance, on Horse-back,
who seemed to halt, and gaze on them▪
without offering to advance;</P>
<P>Sir, said she to her Uncle, are they yonder
Knights whom you suppose will attack us?</P>
<P>Ay, ay, said Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> they are Knights
of the Road indeed: I suppose we shall have a
Bout with them; for it will be scandalous to
deliver, since we have the Odds of our Side,
and are more than a Match for them.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> interpreting these Words in her
own Way, looked out again; and, seeing the
Robbers, who had by this time taken their
Resolution, galloping towards them, her Cou∣sin
<PB N="128" REF="130"/>
and the Servants ranging themselves of each
Side of the Coach, as if to defend them,</P>
<P>Hold, hold, valiant Men, said she, as loud
as she could speak, addressing herself to the
Highwaymen; do not, by a mistaken Genero∣sity,
hazard your Lives in a Combat, to which
the Laws of Honour do not oblige you: We
are not violently carried away, as you falsly
suppose; we go willingly along with these Per∣sons,
who are our Friends and Relations.</P>
<P>Hey-day! cried Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> starting at her
with great Surprize; what's the Meaning of all
this? Do you think these Fellows will mind your
fine Speeches, Niece?</P>
<P>I hope they will, Sir, said she: Then, pulling
her Cousin, shew yourself, for Heaven's Sake,
Miss, pursued she, and second my Assurances,
that we are not forced away: These generous
Men come to fight for our Deliverance.</P>
<P>The Highwaymen, who were near enough
to hear <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Voice, though they could
not distinguish her Words, gazed on her with
great Surprize; and, finding they would be very
well received, thought fit to abandon their En∣terprize,
and galloped away as fast as they were
able. Some of the Servants made a Motion to
pursue them; but Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> forbad it; and,
entering again into the Coach, congratulated
the Ladies upon the Escape they had.</P>
<P>Since these Men, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> did not come
to deliver us, out of a mistaken Notion, that
we were carried away by Force, it must ne∣cessarily
follow, they had some bad Design; and
I protest I know not who to suspect is the Au∣thor
of it, unless the Person you vanquished,
<PB N="129" REF="131"/>
said she to Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> the other Day in a
single Combat; for the disguised <HI>Edward,</HI> you
assured me, was dead: But perhaps, continued
she, it was some Lover of Miss <HI>Glanville</HI>'s,
who designed to make an Attempt to carry her
away: Methinks he was too slenderly attended
for such an hazardous Undertaking.</P>
<P>I'll assure you Madam, said Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI>
I have no Lovers among Highwaymen.</P>
<P>Highwaymen! repeated <HI>Arabella.</HI></P>
<P>Why, ay, to be sure, Madam, rejoined Sir
<HI>Charles:</HI> What do you take them for?</P>
<P>For Persons of Quality, Sir, resumed <HI>Ara∣bella;</HI>
and though they came questionless, either
upon a good or bad Design, yet it cannot be
doubted, but that their Birth is illustrious;
otherwise they would never pretend either to
fight in our Defence, or to carry us away.</P>
<P>I vow, Niece, said Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> I can't possi∣bly
understand you.</P>
<P>My Cousin, Sir, interrupted Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI>
has been mistaken in these Persons; and has not
yet, possibly, believed them to be Highwaymen,
who came to rob us.</P>
<P>There is no Question, Sir, said <HI>Arabella,</HI>
smiling, that if they did not come to defend
us, they came to rob you: But it is hard to
guess, which of us it was of whom they de∣signed
to deprive you; for it may very possibly
be for my Cousin's fake, as well as mine, that
this Enterprize was undertaken.</P>
<P>Pardon me, Madam, said Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who
was willing to prevent his Father from an∣swering
her Absurdities; these Men had no
other Design, than to rob us of our Money.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="132"/>
How! said <HI>Arabella:</HI> Were these Cavaliers▪
who appeared to be in so handsome a Garb,
that I took them for Persons of prime Quality,
were they Robbers? I have been strangely mis∣taken,
it seems: However, I apprehend there is
no Certainty, that your Suspicions are true; and
it may still be as I say, that they either came to
rescue or carry us away.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> to avoid a longer Dispute,
changed the Discourse; having observed with
Confusion, that Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> and his Sister, seem∣ed
to look upon his beloved Cousin as one that
was out of her Senss.</P>

<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Which concludes with an authentic Piece
of History.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>ARABELLA,</HI> during the rest of this Jour∣ney,
was so wholly taken up in contem∣plating
upon the last Adventure, that she mixed
but little in the Conversation. Upon their
drawing near <HI>Bath,</HI> the Situation of that City
afforded her the Means of making a Com∣parison
between the Valley in which it was
placed (with the Amphitheatrical View of the
Hills around it) and the Valley of <HI>Tempe.</HI></P>
<P>'Twas in such a Place as this, said she, pur∣suing
her Comparison, that the fair <HI>Andronice</HI>
delivered the valiant <HI>Hortensius:</HI> And really I
could wish, our Entrance into that City might
<PB N="131" REF="133"/>
be preceded by an Act of equal Humanity
with that of that fair Princess.</P>
<P>For the Gratification of that Wish, Madam,
sid Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> it is necessary some Person
should meet with a Misfortune, out of which
you might be able to relieve him; but I suppose
the Benevolence of your Disposition may be
equally satisfied with not finding any Occasion,
as of exercising it, when it is found.</P>
<P>Though it be not my Fortune to meet with
those Occasions, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> there is no
Reason to doubt but others do, who possibly
have less Inclination to afford their Assistance
than myself: And it is possible, if any other
than the Princess of <HI>Messina</HI> had happened to
pass by, when <HI>Hortensius</HI> was in the Hands of
the <HI>Thessalians,</HI> he would not have been res∣cued
from the ignominious Death he was de∣stined
to, merely for killing a Stork.</P>
<P>How! interrupted Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> put a Man to
Death for killing a Stork! Ridiculous! Pray, in
what Part of the World did that happen?
Among the <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>America,</HI> I suppose.</P>
<P>No, Sir, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> in <HI>Thessaly;</HI> the fairest
Part in all <HI>Macedonia,</HI> famous for the beautiful
Valley of <HI>Tempe,</HI> which excited the Curiosity
of all Travellers whatever.</P>
<P>No, not all, Madam, returned Sir <HI>Charles▪</HI>
for I am acquainted with several Travellers,
who never saw it, nor even mentioned it; and
if it is so famous as you say, I am surprised I
never heard of it before.</P>
<P>I don't know, said <HI>Arabélla,</HI> what those Tra∣vellers
thought worthy of their Notice; but I
am certain, that if any Chance should conduct
<PB N="132" REF="134"/>
me into <HI>Macedonia,</HI> I would not leave it till I
saw the Valley of <HI>Tempe,</HI> so celebrated by all
the Poets and Historians.</P>
<P>Dear Cousin, cried <HI>Glanville,</HI> who could
hardly forbear smiling, what Chance, in the
Name of Wonder, should take you into <HI>Ma∣cedonia,</HI>
at so great a Distance from your own
Country?</P>
<P>And so, said Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> this famous Valley
of <HI>Tempe</HI> is in <HI>Turky.</HI> Why you must be
very fond of travelling, indeed, Lady <HI>Bella,</HI>
if you would go into the <HI>Great Mogul</HI>'s Country,
where the People are all Pagans, they say,
and worship the Devil.</P>
<P>The Country my Cousin speaks of, said Mr.
<HI>Glanville,</HI> is in the Grand Signor's Domi∣nions:
The Great Mogul, you know, Sir—</P>
<P>Well, interrupted Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> the Great
Mogul, or the Grand Signor, I know not
what you call him: But I hope my Niece does
not propose to go thither.</P>
<P>Not unless I am forcibly carried thither, said
<HI>Arabella;</HI> but I do determine, if that Misfor∣tune
should ever happen to me, that I would,
if possible, visit the Vale of <HI>Tempe,</HI> which is
in that Part of <HI>Greece</HI> they call <HI>Macedonia.</HI></P>
<P>Then I am persuaded, replied Sir <HI>Charles,</HI>
you'll never see that famous Valley you talk of;
for it is not very likely you should be forcibly
carried away into <HI>Turky.</HI></P>
<P>And why do you think it unlikely, that I
should be carried thither? interrupted <HI>Arabella.</HI>
Do not the same Things happen now, that
did formerly? And is any thing more common,
then Ladies being carried, by their Ravishers,
<PB N="133" REF="135"/>
into Countries far distant from their own? May
not the same Accidents happen to me, that have
happened to so many illustrious Ladies before
me? And may I not be carried into <HI>Macedonia</HI>
by a Similitude of Destiny with that of a great
many beautiful Princesses, who, though born in
the most distant Quarters of the World, chanced
to meet at one time in the City of <HI>Alexandria,</HI>
and related their miraculous Adventures to each
other?</P>
<P>And it was for that very Purpose they met,
Madam, said Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> smiling.</P>
<P>Why, truly, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> it happened very
luckily for each of them, that they were
brought into a Place where they found so many
illustrious Companions in Misfortune, to whom
they might freely communicate their Adven∣tures,
which otherwise might, haply, have been
concealed, or, at least, have been imperfectly
delivered down to us: However, added she,
smiling, if I am carried into <HI>Macedonia,</HI> and
by that means have an Opportunity of visit∣ing
the famous Vale of <HI>Tempe,</HI> I shall take care
not to draw the Resentment of the <HI>Thessalians</HI>
upon me, by an Indiscretion like that of <HI>Hor∣tensius.</HI></P>
<P>For be pleased to know, Sir, said she, ad∣dressing
herself to her Uncle, that his killing a
Stork, however inconsiderable a Matter it may
appear to us, was yet looked upon as a Crime
of a very atrocious Nature among the <HI>Thes∣salians;</HI>
for they have a Law, which forbids,
upon Pain of Death, the killing of Storks;
the Reason for which is, that <HI>Thessaly</HI> being sub∣ject
to be infested with a prodigious Multitude
<PB N="134" REF="136"/>
of Serpents, which are a delightful Food to
these Sorts of Fowls, they look upon them as
sacred Birds, sent by the Gods to deliver them
from these Serpents and Vipers: And though
<HI>Hortensius,</HI> being a Stranger, was pardoned
through the Intercession of the Princess <HI>Andro∣nice,</HI>
they made him promise to send another
Stork into <HI>Thessaly,</HI> to the end that he might
be reputed innocent.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which one of our Heroine's Whims is
justified, by some others full as whim∣sical.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THIS Piece of History, with Sir <HI>Charles</HI>'s
Remarks upon it, brought them into
<HI>Bath.</HI> Their Lodgings being provided before∣hand,
the Ladies retired to their different Cham∣bers,
to repose themselves after the Fatigue
of their Journey, and did not meet again till
Supper was on Table; when Miss <HI>Glan∣ville,</HI>
who had eagerly enquired what Company
was then in the Place, and heard there were a
great many Persons of Fashion just arrived,
prest <HI>Arabella</HI> to go to the Pump-Room the
next Morning, assuring her she would find a
very agreeable Amusement.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> accordingly consented to accompany
her; and, being told the Ladies went in an Un∣dress
of a Morning, she accommodated herself
to the Custom, and went in a negligent Dress;
but instead of a Capuchin, she were something
<PB N="135" REF="137"/>
like a Veil, of black Gauze, which covered
almost all her Face, and Part of her Waist, and
gave her a very singular Appearance.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> was too envious of her Cou∣sin's
Superiority in point of Beauty, to inform
her of any Oddity in her Dress, which she
thought might expose her to the Ridicule of
those that saw her; and Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> was too
little a Critic in Ladies Apparel, to be sensible
that <HI>Arabella</HI> was not in the Fashion; and since
every thing she wore became her extremely,
he could not choose but think she drest ad∣mirably
well: He handed her therefore, with a
great deal of Satisfaction, into the Pump-Room,
which happened to be greatly crouded
that Morning.</P>
<P>The Attention of most Part of the Compa∣ny
was immediately engaged by the Appear∣ance
Lady <HI>Bella</HI> made. Strangers are here most
strictly criticized, and every new Object affords
a delicious Feast of Raillery and Scandal.</P>
<P>The Ladies, alarmed at the Singularity of
her Dress, crouded together in Parties; and
the Words, Who can she be? Strange Crea∣ture!
Ridiculous! and other Exclamations of
the same Kind, were whispered very intelli∣gibly.</P>
<P>The Men were struck with her Figure,
veiled as she was: Her fine Stature, the beauti∣ful
Turn of her Person, the Grace and Ele∣gance
of her Motion, attracted all their No∣tice:
The Phaenomena of the Veil, however,
gave them great Disturbance. So lovely a Per∣son
seemed to promise the Owner had a Face
not unworthy of it; but that was totally hid
<PB N="136" REF="138"/>
from their View: For <HI>Arabella,</HI> at her En∣trance
into the Room, had pulled the Gauze
quite over her Face, following therein the Cus∣tom
of the Ladies in <HI>Clelia,</HI> and the <HI>Grand Cy∣rus,</HI>
who, in mixed Companies, always hid their
Faces with great Care.</P>
<P>The Wits, and Pretty-Fellows, railed at the
envious Covering, and compared her to the
Sun obscured by a Cloud; while the Beaux
<HI>dem'd</HI> the horrid Innovation, and expressed a
Fear, lest it should grow into a Fashion.</P>
<P>Some of the wiser Sort took her for a Fo∣reigner;
others, of still more Sagacity, supposed
her a <HI>Scots</HI> Lady, covered with her Plaid; and
a third Sort, infinitely wiser than either, con∣cluded
she was a <HI>Spanish</HI> Nun, that had escaped
from a Convent, and had not yet quitted her
Veil.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> ignorant of the Diversity of Opi∣nions,
to which her Appearance gave Rise, was
taken up in discoursing with Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>
upon the medicinal Virtue of the Springs, the
Oeconomy of the Baths, the Nature of the
Diversions, and such other Topics, as the
Objects around them furnished her with.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> was got
amidst a Croud of her Acquaintance, who had
hardly paid the Civilities of a first Meeting, be∣fore
they eagerly inquired, who that Lady she
brought with her was.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> informed them, that she was
her Cousin, and Daughter to the deceased Mar∣quis
of—adding with a Sneer, That she had
been brought up in the Country; knew nothing
of the World; and had some very peculiar No∣tions,
<PB N="137" REF="139"/>
as you may see, said she, by that odd
kind of Covering she wears.</P>
<P>Her Name and Quality were presently whis∣pered
all over the Room: The Men, hearing
she was a great Heiress, found greater Beauties
to admire in her Person: The Ladies, aw'd
by the Sanction of Quality, dropt their Ridi∣cule
on her Dress, and began to quote Exam∣ples
of Whims full as inexcusable.</P>
<P>One remembred, that Lady <HI>J—T—</HI> al∣always
wore her Ruffles reversed; that the
Countess of—went to Court in a Far∣thingale;
that the Duchess of—sat astride
upon a Horse; and a certain Lady of great
Fortune, and nearly allied to Quality, because
she was not dignified with a Title, invented a
new one for herself; and directed her Servants
to say in speaking to her, <HI>Your Honouress,</HI> which
afterwards became a Custom among all her Ac∣quaintance;
who mortally offended her, if
they omitted that Instance of Respect.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Containing some historical Anecdotes, the
Truth of which may possibly be doubted,
as they are not to be found in any of the
Historians.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFTER a short Stay in the Room, <HI>Ara∣bella</HI>
expressing a Desire to return home,
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> conducted her out. Two Gentle∣men
of his Acquaintance attending Miss <HI>Glan∣ville,</HI>
<PB N="138" REF="140"/>
Sir, <HI>Charles</HI> detained them to Breakfast;
by which means they had an Opportunity of
satisfying their Curiosity; and beheld <HI>Arabella,</HI>
divested of that Veil, which had, as they said;
and 'tis probable they said no more than they
thought, concealed one of the finest Faces in
the World.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> had the Mortification to see
both the Gentlemen so charmed with the Sight
of her Cousin's Face, that for a long time she
sat wholly neglected; but the Seriousness of her
Behaviour, giving some little Disgust to the
youngest of them, who was what the Ladies
call a Pretty-Fellow, a dear Creature, and the
most diverting Man in the World; he applied
himself wholly to Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> and soon en∣gaged
her in a particular Conversation.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI> so was the other Gentleman
called, was of a much graver Cast: He affected
to be thought deep-read in History, and never
failed to take all Opportunities of displaying
his Knowlege of Antiquity, which was indeed
but very superficial; but having some few Anec∣dotes
by Heart, which he would take Occa∣tion
to introduce as often as he could, he passed
among many Persons for one, who, by Appli∣cation
and Study, had acquired an universal
Knowlege of antient History.</P>
<P>Speaking of any particular Circumstance, he
would fix the Time, by computing the Year
with the Number of the Olympiads.</P>
<P>It happened, he would say, in the 141st
Olympiad.</P>
<P>Such an amazing Exactness, had a suitable
<PB N="139" REF="141"/>
Effect on his Audience, and always procured
him a great Degree of Attention.</P>
<P>This Gentleman hitherto had no Opportu∣nity
of displaying his Knowledge of History,
the Discourse having wholly turned upon News,
and other Trifles; when <HI>Arabella,</HI> after some
more Inquiries concerning the Place, remark∣ed,
that there was a very great Difference be∣tween
the medicinal Waters at <HI>Bath,</HI> and the
fine Springs at the Foot of the Mountain <HI>Ther∣mopylae</HI>
in <HI>Greece,</HI> as well in their Qualities, as
manner of using them; and I am of Opinion,
added she, that <HI>Bath,</HI> famous as it is for re∣storing
Health, is less frequented by infirm
Persons, than the famous Springs of <HI>Thermopylae</HI>
were by the Beauties of <HI>Greece,</HI> to whom those
Waters have the Reputation of giving new
Lustre.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI> who, with all his Reading, had
never met with any Account of these celebrated
<HI>Grecian</HI> Springs, was extremely disconcerted at
not being able to continue a Conversation,
which the Silence of the rest of the Company
made him imagine, was directed wholly to
him.</P>
<P>The Shame he conceived at seeing himself
posed by a Girl, in a Matter which so imme∣diately
belonged to him, made him resolve to
draw himself out of this Dilemma at any Rate;
aud, though he was far from being convinced,
that there were no such Springs at <HI>Thermopylae</HI> as
<HI>Arabella</HI> mentioned; yet he resolutely main∣tained,
that she must be mistaken in their Situa∣tion;
for, to his certain Knowlege, there were
<PB N="140" REF="142"/>
no medicinal Waters at the Foot of that Moun∣tain.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> who could not endure to be con∣tradicted
in what she took to be so incontest∣able
a Fact, reddened with Vexation at his un∣expected
Denial.</P>
<P>It should seem, said she, by your Discourse,
that you are unacquainted with many material
Passages, that passed among very illustrious
Persons there; and if you knew any thing of
<HI>Pisistratus</HI> the <HI>Athenian,</HI> you would know, that
an Adventure he had at those Baths, laid the
Foundation of all those great Designs, which he
afterwards effected, to the total Subversion of
the <HI>Athenian</HI> Government.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI> surprised that this Piece of Hi∣story
had likewise escaped his Observation, re∣solved,
however, not to give up his Point.</P>
<P>I think, Madam, replied he, with great
Self-sufficiency, that I am pretty well acquaint∣ed
with every thing which relates to the Af∣fairs
of the <HI>Athenian</HI> Commonwealth; and know
by what Steps <HI>Pisistratus</HI> advanced himself to
the Sovereignty. It was a great Stroke of Po∣licy
in him, said he, turning to Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI>
indeed, to wound himself, in order to get a
Guard assigned him.</P>
<P>You are mistaken, Sir, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> if you
believe, there was any Truth in the Report of
his having wounded himself: It was done, either
by his Rival <HI>Lycurgus</HI> or <HI>Theocrites;</HI> who be∣lieving
him still to be in Love with the fair
<HI>Cerinthe,</HI> whom he courted, took that Way to
get rid of him: Neither is it true, that Am∣bition
alone inspired <HI>Pisistratus</HI> with a Design of
<PB N="141" REF="143"/>
enslaving his Country: Those Authors who say
so, must know little of the Springs and Motives
of his Conduct. It was neither Ambition nor
Revenge, that made him act as he did; it was
the violent Affection he conceived for the beau∣tiful
<HI>Chorante,</HI> whom he first saw at the famous
Baths of <HI>Thermopylae,</HI> which put him upon those
Designs; for, seeing that <HI>Lycurgus,</HI> who was
not his Rival in Ambition, but Love, would
certainly become the Possessor of <HI>Chorante,</HI> un∣less
he made himself Tyrant of <HI>Athens,</HI> he had
recourse to that violent Method, in order to
preserve her for himself.</P>
<P>I protest, Madam, said Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI> casting
down his Eyes in great Confusion at her su∣perior
Knowlege in History, these Particu∣lars
have all escaped my Notice; and this is the
first time I ever understood, that <HI>Pisistratus</HI> was
violently in Love; and that it was not Ambi∣tion,
which made him aspire to Sovereignty.</P>
<P>I do not remember any Mention of this in
<HI>Plutarch,</HI> continued he, rubbing his Forehead,
or any of the Authors who have treated on the
Affairs of <HI>Greece.</HI></P>
<P>Very likely, Sir, replied <HI>Arabella;</HI> but you
will see the whole Story of <HI>Pisistratus</HI>'s Love
for <HI>Chorante,</HI> with the Effects it produced, re∣lated
at large in <HI>Scudery.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Scudery,</HI> Madam! said the sage Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI>
I never read that Historian.</P>
<P>No, Sir! replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> then your Read∣ing
has been very confined.</P>
<P>I know, Madam, said he, that <HI>Herodotus,
Thucydides,</HI> and <HI>Plutarch,</HI> have indeed quoted
him frequently.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="144"/>
I am surprised, Sir, said Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who
was excessively diverted at this Discovery of
his great Ignorance and Affectation, that you
have not read that famous Historian; especially,
as the Writers you have mentioned quote him
so often.</P>
<P>Why, to tell you the Truth, Sir, said he;
though he was a <HI>Roman;</HI> yet it is objected to
him, that he wrote but indifferent <HI>Latin;</HI> with
no Purity or Elegance; and—</P>
<P>You are quite mistaken, Sir, interrupted
<HI>Arabella;</HI> the great <HI>Scudery</HI> was a <HI>Frenchman;</HI>
and both his <HI>Clelia</HI> and <HI>Artamenes</HI> were written
in <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Frenchman</HI> was he? said Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI> with
a lofty Air: Oh! then, 'tis not surprising,
that I have not read him: I read no Authors,
but the Antients, Madam, added he, with a
Look of Self-applause; I cannot relish the Mo∣derns
at all: I have no Taste for their Way of
Writing.</P>
<P>But <HI>Scudery</HI> must needs be more ancient
than <HI>Thucydides,</HI> and the rest of those <HI>Greek</HI>
Historians you mentioned, said Mr. <HI>Glanville:</HI>
How else could they quote him?</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> was here so utterly at a Loss, that
he could not conceal his Confusion: He held
down his Head, and continued silent; while the
Beau, who had listened to the latter Part of their
Discourse; exerted his supposed Talent of
Raillery against the unhappy Admirer of the
antient Authors; and increased his Confusion
by a thousand Sarcasms, which gave more Di∣version
to himself, than any body else.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="143" REF="145"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Which contains some excellent Rules for
Raillery.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who had too much Polite∣ness
and Good nature to insist too long
upon the Ridicule in the Character of his Ac∣quaintance,
changed the Discourse: And <HI>Ara∣bella,</HI>
who had observed, with some Concern,
the ill-judged Raillery of the young Beau, took
Occasion to decry that Species of Wit; and
gave it as her Opinion, that it was very dan∣gerous
and unpleasing.</P>
<P>For, truly, said she, it is almost impossible
to use it without being hated or feared: and
whoever gets a Habit of it, is in Danger of
wronging all the Laws of Friendship and Hu∣manity.</P>
<P>Certainly, pursued she, looking at the Beau,
it is extremely unjust to railly one's Friends, and
particular Acquaintance: First, choose them well,
and be as nice as you please in the Choice; but
when you have chosen them, by no means play
upon them: 'Tis cruel and malicious, to di∣vert
one's self at the Expence of one's Friend.</P>
<P>However, Madam, said Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who
was charmed to hear her talk so rationally, you
may give People Leave to railly their Ene∣mies.</P>
<P>Truly, resumed <HI>Arabella,</HI> I cannot allow
that, any more than upon Friends; for Raillery
is the poorest kind of Revenge that can be taken:
<PB N="144" REF="146"/>
Methinks, it is mean to railly Persons who
have a small Share of Merit; since, haply, their
Defects were born with them, and not of their
own acquiring; and it is great Injustice to des∣cant
upon one slight Fault in Men of Parts, to
the Prejudice of a thousand good Qualities.</P>
<P>For aught I see, Madam, said the Beau, you
will not allow one to railly any body.</P>
<P>I am of Opinion, Sir, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> that
there are very few proper Objects for Raillery;
and still fewer, who can railly well: The Ta∣lent
of Raillery ought to be born with a Per∣son;
no Art can infuse it; and those who en∣deavour
to railly in spite of Nature, will be so
far from diverting others, that they will become
the Objects of Ridicule themselves.</P>
<P>Many other pleasing Qualities of Wit may
be acquired by Pains and Study, but Raillery
must be the Gift of Nature: It is not enough
to have many lively and agreeable Thoughts;
but there must be such an Expression, as must
convey their full Force and Meaning; the
Air the Aspect, the Tone of the Voice, and
every Part in general, must contribute to its
Perfection.</P>
<P>There ought also to be a great Distance be∣tween
Raillery and Satire, so that one may ne∣ver
be mistaken for the other: Raillery ought
indeed to surprise, and sensibly touch, those to
whom it is directed; but I would not have the
Wounds it makes, either deep or lasting: Let
those who feel it, be hurt like Persons, who,
gathering Roses, are pricked by the Thorns,
and find a sweet Smoll to make amends.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="147"/>
I would have Raillery raise the Fancy, and
quicken the Imagination, the Fire of its Wit
should only enable us to trace its Original,
and shine as the Stars do, but not burn.
Yet, after all, I cannot greatly approve of
Raillery, or cease to think it dangerous; and,
to pursue my Comparison, said she, with an
inchanting Smile, Persons who possess the
true Talent of Raillery, are like Comets; they
are seldom seen, and are at once admir'd and
fear'd.</P>
<P>I protest, Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> said Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> who
had listen'd to her with many Signs of Admi∣ration,
you speak like an Orator.</P>
<P>One would not imagine, interrupted Mr.
<HI>Glanville,</HI> who saw <HI>Arabella</HI> in some Confusion
at the coarse Praise her Uncle gave her, that
my Cousin could speak so accurately of a Qua∣lity
she never practises: And 'tis easy to judge
by what she has said, that no body can railly
finer than herself, if she pleases.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI> tho' he bore her a Grudge for
knowing more History than he did, yet assur'd
her, that she had given the best Rules imagin∣able
for raillying well. But the Beau, whom
she had silenc'd by her Reproof, was extremely
angry; and, supposing it would mortify her to
see him pay Court to her Cousin, he redoubled
his Assiduities to Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> who was highly
delighted at seeing <HI>Arabella</HI> less taken Notice of
by this gay Gentleman, than herself.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which the Author condescends to be very
minute in the Description of our Heroin's
Dress.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Indifference of Mr. <HI>Tinsel,</HI> convin∣cing
Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> that <HI>Arabella</HI> was
less to be dreaded than she imagin'd, she had no
Reluctance at seeing her prepare for her publick
Appearance the next Ball Night.</P>
<P>Having consulted her Fancy in a rich Silver
Stuff, she had bought for that Purpose, a Person
was sent for to make it; and <HI>Arabella,</HI> who
follow'd no Fashion but her own Taste, which
was form'd on the Manners of the Heroines,
order'd the Woman to make her a Robe after
the same Model as the Princess <HI>Julia</HI>'s.</P>
<P>The Mantua-maker, who thought it might
do her great Prejudice with her new Customer,
to acknowledge she knew nothing of the Prin∣cess
<HI>Julia,</HI> or the Fashion of her Gown, replied
at Random, and with great Pertness,</P>
<P>That, that Taste was quite out; and, she
would advise her Ladyship to have her Cloaths
made in the present Mode, which was far more
becoming.</P>
<P>You can never persuade me, said <HI>Arabella,</HI>
that any Fashion can be more becoming than
that of the Princess <HI>Julia</HI>'s, who was the most
gallant Princess upon Earth, and knew better
than any other, how to set off her Charms.
It may indeed be a little obselete now, pursued
<PB N="147" REF="149"/>
she, for the Fashion could not but alter a little
in the Compass of near two thousand Years.</P>
<P>Two thousand Years! Madam, said the Wo∣man,
in a great Surprize; Lord help us Trades-people,
if they did not alter a thousand Times
in as many Days! I thought your Ladyship
was speaking of the last Month's Taste; which,
as I said before, is quite out now.</P>
<P>Well, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> let the present Mode
be what it will, I insist upon having my Cloaths
made after the Pattern of the beautiful Daugh∣ter
of <HI>Augustus;</HI> being convinced, that none
other can be half so becoming.</P>
<P>What Fashion was that, pray, Madam, said
the Woman? I never saw it.</P>
<P>How, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> Have you already for∣got
the Fashion of the Princess <HI>Julia</HI>'s Robe,
which you said was wore but last Month? Or,
are you ignorant that the Princess <HI>Julia,</HI> and
the Daughter of <HI>Augustus,</HI> is the same Person?</P>
<P>I protest, Madam, said the Woman, ex∣tremely
confus'd, I had forgot that, till you
called it to my Mind.</P>
<P>Well, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> make me a Robe in the
same Taste.</P>
<P>The Mantua-maker was now wholly at a
Loss in what Manner to behave; for, being
conscious that she knew nothing of the Princess
<HI>Julia</HI>'s Fashion, she could not undertake to
make it without Directions; and she was afraid
of discovering her Ignorance by asking for any;
so that her Silence and Embarrassment persua∣ding
<HI>Arabella</HI> she knew nothing of the Matter,
she dismist her with a small Present, for the
Trouble she had given her, and had Recourse
<PB N="148" REF="150"/>
to her usual Expedient, which was, to make
one of her Women, who understood a little of
the Mantua-making Business, make a Robe for
her, after her own Directions.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> who imagin'd she had sent
for Work-women, in order to have Cloaths
made in the modern Taste, was surpriz'd at her
Entrance into her Chamber, to see her dressing
for the Ball, in a Habit singular to the last
Degree.</P>
<P>She wore no Hoop, and the Blue and Silver
Stuff of her Robe, was only kept by its own
Richness, from hanging close about her. It
was quite open round her Breast, which was
shaded with a rich Border of Lace; and clasp∣ing
close to her Waist, by small Knots of Dia∣monds,
descended in a sweeping Train on the
Ground.</P>
<P>The Sleeves were short, wide, and slash'd,
fastned in different Places with Diamonds, and
her Arms were partly hid by half a Dozen Falls
of Ruffles. Her Hair, which fell in very easy
Ringlets on her Neck, was plac'd with great
Care and Exactness round her lovely Face; and
the Jewels and Ribbons, which were all her
Head-dress, dispos'd to the greatest Advantage.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, nothing could be more sin∣gularly
becoming than her Dress; or set off
with greater Advantage the striking Beauties of
her Person.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> tho' she was not displeas'd to
see her persist in her Singularity of Dress; yet
could not behold her look so lovely in it, with∣out
feeling a secret Uneasiness; but consoling
herself with the Hopes of the Ridicule she
<PB N="149" REF="151"/>
would occasion, she assum'd a chearful Air,
approv'd her Taste in the Choice of her Co∣lours,
and went with her at the usual Hour,
to the Rooms, attended by Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI>
Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI> and the young Beau we have for∣merly
mention'd.</P>
<P>The Surprize <HI>Arabella</HI>'s unusual Appearance
gave to the whole Company, was very visible
to every one but herself.</P>
<P>The Moment she enter'd the Room, every
one whisper'd the Person next to them; and for
some Moments, nothing was heard but the
Words, the Princess <HI>Julia;</HI> which was eccho'd
at every Corner, and at last attracted her Ob∣servation.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> and the rest of the Company
with her, were in some Confusion at the uni∣versal
Exclamation, which they imagin'd was
occasion'd by the Singularity of her Habit;
tho' they could not conceive, why they gave
her that Title. Had they known the Adven∣ture
of the Mantua-maker, it would doubtless
have easily occurr'd to them; for the Woman
had no sooner left <HI>Arabella,</HI> than she related
the Conference she had with a Lady newly ar∣riv'd,
who had requir'd her to make a Robe in
the Manner of the Princess <HI>Julia</HI>'s; and dis∣miss'd
her, because she did not understand the
Fashions that prevail'd two thousand Years ago.</P>
<P>This Story was quickly dispers'd, and for its
Novelty, afforded a great deal of Diversion;
every one long'd to see a Fashion of such An∣tiquity;
and expected the Appearance of the
Princess <HI>Julia</HI> with great Impatience.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="152"/>
It is not to be doubted but much Mirth was
treasur'd up for her Appearance; and the occa∣sional
Humourist had already prepared his ac∣custom'd
Jest, when the Sight of the devoted
fair One repell'd his Vivacity, and the design'd
Ridicule of the whole Assembly.</P>
<P>Scarce had the first tumultous Whisper escap'd
the Lips of each Individual, when they found
themselves aw'd to Respect by that irresistable
Charm in the Person of <HI>Arabella,</HI> which com∣manded
Reverence and Love from all who be∣held
her.</P>
<P>Her noble Air, the native Dignity in her
Looks, the inexpressible Grace which accom∣pany'd
all her Motions, and the consummate
Loveliness of her Form, drew the Admiration
of the whole Assembly.</P>
<P>A respectful Silence succeeded, and the Asto∣nishment
her Beauty occasion'd, left them no
Room to descant on the Absurdity of her Dress.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> who felt a malicious Joy at
the Sneers she expected would be cast on her
Cousin, was greatly disappointed at the Defer∣ence
which seem'd to be paid her; and to vent
some Part of her Spleen, took occasion to men∣tion
her Surprize, at the Behaviour of the
Company on their Entrance; wondering what
they could mean by whispering the Princess
<HI>Julia</HI> to one another.</P>
<P>I assure you, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> smiling, I am not
less surpriz'd than you at it; and since they di∣rected
their Looks to me at the same Time, I
fancy they either took me for some Princess of
the Name of <HI>Julia,</HI> who is expected here to-Night,
<PB N="151" REF="153"/>
or else flatter me with some Resem∣blance
to the beautiful Daughter of <HI>Augustus.</HI></P>
<P>The Comparison, Madam, said Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI>
who took all Occasions to shew his Reading, is
too injurious to you, for I am of Opinion you
as much excel that licentious Lady in the Beau∣ties
of your Person, as you do in the Qualities
of your Mind.</P>
<P>I never heard Licentiousness imputed to the
Daughter of <HI>Augustus Caesar,</HI> said <HI>Arabella;</HI>
and the most her Enemies can say of her, is,
that she loved Admiration, and would permit
herself to be beloved, and to be told so, with∣out
shewing any Signs of Displeasure.</P>
<P>Bless me, Madam, interrupted Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI>
how strangely do you mistake the Character of
<HI>Julia:</HI> Tho' the Daughter of an Emperor,
she was, pardon the Expression, the most aban∣don'd
Prostitute in <HI>Rome;</HI> many of her Intrigues
are recorded in History; but to mention only
one, Was not her infamous Commerce with
<HI>Ovid,</HI> the Cause of his Banishment?</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Some Reflexions very fit, and others very
unfit for an Assembly-Room.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>YOU speak in strange Terms, replied <HI>Ara∣bella,</HI>
blushing, of a Princess, who if she
was not the most reserv'd and severe Person in
the World, was yet nevertheless, absolutely
chaste.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="154"/>
I know there were People who represented
her Partiality for <HI>Ovid</HI> in a very unfavourable
Light; but that ingenious Poet, when he re∣lated
his History to the great <HI>Agrippa,</HI> told him
in Confidence all that had pass'd between him
and the Princess <HI>Julia,</HI> than which nothing
could be more innocent tho' a little indiscreet.
For, 'tis certain that she permitted him to love
her, and did not condemn him to any rigorous
Punishment for daring to tell her so; yet, for
all this, as I said before, tho' she was not alto∣gether
so austere as she ought to have been, yet
she was nevertheless a most virtuous Princess.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI> not daring to contradict a Lady
whose extensive Reading had furnish'd her with
Anecdotes unknown almost to any Body else,
by his Silence confess'd her Superiority. But
Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who knew all these Anecdotes
were drawn from Romances, which he found
contradicted the known Facts in History, and
assign'd the most ridiculous Causes for Things
of the greatest Importance; could not help
smiling at the Facility with which Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI>
gave into those idle Absurdities. For notwith∣standing
his Affectation of great Reading, his
superficial Knowledge of History made it ex∣tremely
easy to deceive him; and as it was his
Custom to mark in his Pocket-Book all the
Scraps of History he heard introduced into Con∣versation,
and retail them again in other Com∣pany;
he did not doubt but he would make a
Figure with the curious Circumstances <HI>Arabella</HI>
had furnish'd him with.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> observing Mr. <HI>Tinsel</HI> by his familiar
Bows, significant Smiles, and easy Salutations,
<PB N="153" REF="155"/>
was acquainted with the greatest Part of the
Assembly, told him, that she did not doubt but
he knew the Adventures of many Persons whom
they were viewing; and that he would do her
a Pleasure, if he would relate some of them.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Tinsel</HI> was charm'd with a Request which
afforded him an Opportunity of gratifying a fa∣vourite
Inclination, and seating himself near
her immediately, was beginning to obey her
Injunctions, when she gracefully intreated him
to stay a Moment; and calling to Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>
and his Sister, who were talking to Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI>
ask'd them if they chose to partake of a more
rational Amusement than Dancing, and listen
to the Adventures of some illustrious Persons,
which Mr. <HI>Tinsel</HI> had promis'd to relate.</P>
<P>I assure you, Madam, said Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI>
smiling, you will find that a less innocent
Amusement than Dancing.</P>
<P>Why so, Sir, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> since it is not
an indiscreet Curiosity which prompts me to a
Desire of hearing the Histories Mr. <HI>Tinsel</HI> has
promis'd to entertain me with; but rather a
Hope of hearing something which may at once
improve and delight me; something which
may excite my Admiration, engage my Esteem,
or influence my Practice.</P>
<P>'Twas doubtless, with such Motives as these,
that we find Princesses and Ladies of the most
illustrious Rank, in <HI>Clelia</HI> and the Grand <HI>Cyrus,</HI>
listning to the Adventures of Persons, in whom
they were probably as little interested, as we
are in these around us. Kings, Princes, and
Commanders of Armies, thought it was no
Waste of their Time, in the midst of the
<PB N="154" REF="156"/>
Hurry and Clamour of a Camp, to listen many
Hours to the Relation of one single History,
and not fill'd with any extraordinary Events;
but haply a simple Recital of common Occur∣rences:
The great <HI>Cyrus,</HI> while he was busy
in reducing all <HI>Asia</HI> to his Yoke, heard never∣theless,
the Histories of all the considerable Per∣sons
in the Camp, besides those of Strangers,
and even his Enemies. If there was therefore
any thing either criminal or mean, in hearing
the Adventures of others, do you imagine so
many great and illustrious Persons would have
given in to such an Amusement?</P>
<P>After this <HI>Arabella</HI> turn'd gravely about to
Mr. <HI>Tinsel,</HI> and told him, he was at Liberty to
begin his Recital.</P>
<P>The Beau, a little disconcerted by the So∣lemnity
with which she requested his Informa∣tion,
knew not how to begin with the Forma∣lity
that he saw was required of him; and
therefore fat silent for a few Moments; which
<HI>Arabella</HI> suppos'd was to recall to his Memory
all the Passages he propos'd to relate.</P>
<P>His Perplexity would probably have increas'd
instead of lessening by the profound Silence
which she observed, had not Miss <HI>Glanville</HI>
seated herself with a sprightly Air on the other
Side of him, and directing his Eyes to a tall
handsome Woman that had just enter'd, ask'd
him pleasantly, to tell her History if he knew it.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Tinsel,</HI> brought into his usual Track by
this Question, answer'd smiling, That the Hi∣story
of that Lady was yet a Secret, or known
but to very few; but my Intelligence, added
<PB N="155" REF="157"/>
he, is generally the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and may always
be depended on.</P>
<P>Perhaps, said <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Lady is one of your
Acquaintances, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> you with the Re∣cital
of her <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> from her own Mouth.</P>
<P>No, really, Madam, answer'd Mr. <HI>Tinsel,</HI>
surpriz'd at the great Simplicity of <HI>Arabella,</HI>
for so he understood it; the Lady, I believe, is
not so communicative: And to say the Truth,
I should not chuse to hear her Adventures from
herself, since she certainly would suppress the
most material Circumstances.</P>
<P>In a Word, said he, lowering his Voice,
That Lady was for many Years the Mistress of
a young military Nobleman, whom she was so
complaisant to follow in all his Campaigns,
Marches, Sieges, and every Inconveniency of
War: He married her in <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> from
whence he is lately arriv'd, and introduc'd his
new Lady to his noble Brother, by whom she
was not unfavourably receiv'd. 'Tis worth
remarking, that this same haughty Peer thought
sit to resent with implacable Obstinacy, the
Marriage of another of his Brothers, with the
Widow of a brave Officer, of considerable
Rank in the Army. 'Tis true, she was several
Years older than the young Lord, and had no
Fortune; but the Duke assign'd other Reasons
for his Displeasure: He complain'd loudly, that
his Brother had dishonour'd the Nobility of his
Birth, by this Alliance, and continued his Re∣sentment
till the Death of the young Hero, who
gave many remarkable Proofs of his Courage
and Fortitude upon several Occasions, and died
gloriously before the Walls of <HI>Carthagena;</HI>
<PB N="156" REF="158"/>
leaving his disconsolate Lady a Widow a se∣cond
Time, with the Acquisition of a Title
indeed, but a very small Addition to her For∣tune.</P>
<P>Observe that gay, splendid Lady, I beseech
you, Madam, pursued he, turning to <HI>Arabella;</HI>
how affectedly she looks and talks, and throws
her Eyes around the Room, with a haughty
Self-sufficiency in her Aspect, and insolent Con∣tempt
for every Thing but herself. Her Ha∣bit,
her Speech, her Motions, are all <HI>French;</HI>
nothing in <HI>England</HI> is able to please her; the
People so dull, so aukwardly polite, the Man∣ners
so gross; no Delicacy, no Elegance, no
Magnificence in their Persons, Houses, or Di∣versions;
every Thing is so distasteful, there
is no living in such a Place. One may crawl
about, indeed, she says, and make a shift to
breathe in the odious Country, but one cannot
be said to live; and with all the Requisites to
render Life delightful, here, one can only suffer,
not enjoy it.</P>
<P>Would one not imagine, pursued he, this
fine Lady was a Person of very exalted Rank,
who has the Sanction of Birth, Riches, and
Grandeur for her extraordinary Pride; and yet
she is no other than the Daughter of an Inn-Keeper
at <HI>Spa,</HI> and had the exalted Post assign'd
her of attending new Lodgers to their Apart∣ments,
acquainting them with all the Conve∣niences
of the Place, answering an humble
Question or two concerning what Company
was in the Town, what Scandal was stirring,
and the like.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="159"/>
One of our great Sea Commanders going
thither for his Health, happen'd to lodge at this
Inn; and was so struck with her Charms, that
he marry'd her in a few Weeks, and soon after
brought her to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Such was the Origin of this fantastick Lady;
whose insupportable Pride and ridiculous Af∣fectation,
draws Contempt and Aversion where∣she
appears.</P>
<P>Did I not tell you, Madam, interrupted
Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> that the Amusement you had
chose was not so innocent as Dancing? What a
deal of Scandal has Mr. <HI>Tinsel</HI> utter'd in the
Compass of a few Minutes?</P>
<P>I assure you, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> I know not
what to make of the Histories he has been re∣lating.
I think they do not deserve that Name,
and are rather detatched Pieces of Satire on
particular Persons, than a serious Relation of
Facts. I confess my Expectations from this
Gentleman have not been answer'd.</P>
<P>I think, however, Madam, said Mr. <HI>Glan∣ville,</HI>
we may allow that there is a negative
Merit in the Relations Mr. <HI>Tinsel</HI> has made;
for, if he has not shewn us any Thing to ap∣prove,
he has at least shewn us what to condemn.</P>
<P>The Ugliness of Vice, reply'd <HI>Arabella,</HI>
ought only to be represented to the Vicious;
to whom Satire, like a magnifying Glass, may
aggravate every Defect, in order to make its
Deformity appear more hideous; but since its
End is only to reprove and amend, it should
never be address'd to any but those who come
within its Correction, and may be the better
for it: A virtuous Mind need not be shewn
<PB N="158" REF="160"/>
the Deformity of Vice, to make it be hated and
avoided; the more pure and uncorrupted our
Ideas are, the less shall we be insluenc'd by Ex∣ample.
A natural Propensity to Virtue or
Vice often determines the Choice: 'Tis suffi∣cient
therefore to shew a good Mind what it
ought to pursue, though a bad one must be told
what to avoid. In a Word, one ought to be
always incited, the other always restrain'd.</P>
<P>I vow, Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> said Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI>
you'd make one think one came here to hear a
Sermon; you are so very grave, and talk upon
such high-flown Subjects. What Harm was
there in what Mr. <HI>Tinsel</HI> was telling us? It
would be hard indeed, if one might not divert
one's self with other Peoples Faults.</P>
<P>I am afraid, Miss, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> those who
can divert themselves with the Faults of others,
are not behind hand in affording Diversion.
And that very Inclination, added she, smilingly,
to hear other Peoples Faults, may by those very
People, be condemned as one, and afford them
the same Kind of ill-natur'd Pleasure you are
so desirous of.</P>
<P>Nay, Madam, return'd Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> your
Ladyship was the first who introduc'd the Dis∣course
you condemn so much. Did not you
desire Mr. <HI>Tinsel</HI> to tell you Histories about the
Company; and ask my brother and me, to
come and hear them?</P>
<P>'Tis true, reply'd <HI>Arabella,</HI> that I did desire
you to partake with me of a pleasing and
rational Amusement, for such I imagin'd
Mr. <HI>Tinsel</HI>'s Histories might afford; far from a
Detail of Vices, Follies, and Irregularities, I
<PB N="159" REF="161"/>
expected to have heard the Adventures of some
illustrious Personages related; between whose
Actions, and those of the Heroes and Heroines
of Antiquity, I might have found some Re∣semblance.</P>
<P>For Instance, I hop'd to have heard imitated
the sublime Courage of a <HI>Clelia,</HI> who, to save
her Honour from the Attempts of the impious
<HI>Tarquin,</HI> leap'd into the River <HI>Tyber,</HI> and swam
to the other Side; or the noble Resolution of
the incomparable <HI>Candace,</HI> who, to escape out
of the Hands of her Ravisher, the Pirate <HI>Ze∣nadorus,</HI>
set Fire to his Vessel with her own
Hands, and committed herself to the Mercy of
the Waves: Or, the Constancy and Affection
of a <HI>Mandana,</HI> who, for the Sake of a <HI>Cyrus,</HI>
refused the richest Crowns in the World, and
braved the Terrors of Death to preserve herself
for him.</P>
<P>As for the Men, I hoped to have heard of
some who might have almost equall'd the great
<HI>Oroondates,</HI> the invincible <HI>Artaban,</HI> the valiant
<HI>Juba,</HI> the renowned <HI>Alcamenes,</HI> and many
thousand Heroes of Antiquity; whose glorious
Exploits in War, aud unsaken Constancy in
Love, have given them an immortal Fame.</P>
<P>While <HI>Arabella</HI> was uttering this long Speech,
with great Emotion, Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> with a sly
Look at the Beau, gave him to understand,
that was her Cousin's Foible.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Tinsel,</HI> however, not able to compre∣hend
the Meaning of what she said, listen'd to
her with many Signs of Perplexity and Wonder.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> in secret repin'd at her prodigious
Knowledge of History; and Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI>
<PB N="160" REF="162"/>
with his Eyes fix'd on the Ground, bit his Lips
almost through with Madness.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, several among the Com∣pany,
desirous of hearing what the strange
Lady was saying so loud, and with so much
Eagerness and Emotion, gather'd round them;
which Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> observing, and fearing
<HI>Arabella</HI> would expose herself still farther, whis∣per'd
his Sister to get her away if possible.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> tho' very unwilling, obey'd
his Injunctions; and complaining of a sudden
Head-ach, <HI>Arabella</HI> immediately propos'd re∣tiring,
which was joyfully complied with by
Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who with the other Gentlemen
attended them home.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Being a Chapter of the Satyrical Kind.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AT their Return, Sir <HI>Charles</HI> told his Niece,
That she had now had a Specimen of the
World, and some of the fashionable Amuse∣ments;
and ask'd her, how she had been en∣tertain'd.</P>
<P>Why, truly, Sir, replied she, smiling, I
have brought away no great Relish for a Re∣newal
of the Amusement I have partaken of
To-night. If the World, in which you seem
to think I am but new initiated, affords only
these Kinds of Pleasures, I shall very soon regret
the Solitude and Books I have quitted.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="163"/>
Why pray, said Miss <HI>Glanville?</HI> What Kind
of Amusements did your Ladyship expect to
find in the World? And what was there dis∣agreeable
in your Entertainment to Night? I
am sure there is no Place in <HI>England,</HI> except
<HI>London,</HI> where there is so much good Company
to be met with, as here. The Assembly was
very numerous and brillant, and one can be at
no Loss for Amusements: The Pump-Room in
the Morning, the Parade, and the Rooms, in
the Evening, with little occasional Parties of
Pleasure, will find one sufficient Employment,
and leave none of one's Time to lye useless up∣on
one's Hand.</P>
<P>I am of Opinion, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> that
one's Time is far from being well employ'd in
the Manner you portion it out: And People
who spend theirs in such trifling Amusements,
must certainly live to very little Purpose.</P>
<P>What room, I pray you, does a Lady give
for high and noble Adventures, who consumes
her Days in Dressing, Dancing, listening to
Songs, and ranging the Walks with People as
thoughtless as herself? How mean and con∣temptible
a Figure must a Life spent in such idle
Amusements make in History? Or rather, Are
not such Persons always buried in Oblivion,
and can any Pen be found who would conde∣scend
to record such inconsiderable Actions?</P>
<P>Nor can I persuade myself, added she, that
any of those Men whom I saw at the Assembly,
with Figures so feminine, Voices so soft, such
tripping Steps, and unmeaning Gestures, have
ever signalized either their Courage or Con∣stancy;
<PB N="162" REF="164"/>
but might be overcome by their Enemy
in Battle, or be false to their Mistress in Love.</P>
<P>Law! Cousin, reply'd Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> you
are always talking of Battles and Fighting. Do
you expect that Persons of Quality, and fine
Gentlemen, will go to the Wars? What Bu∣siness
have they to fight? That belongs to the
Officers.</P>
<P>Then every fine Gentleman is an Officer,
said <HI>Arabella;</HI> and some other Title ought to
be found out for Men who do nothing but
Dance and Dress.</P>
<P>I could never have imagined, interrupted
Mr. <HI>Tinsel,</HI> surveying <HI>Arabella,</HI> that a Lady so
elegant and gay in her own Appearance, should
have an Aversion to Pleasure and Magnificence.</P>
<P>I assure you, Sir, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> I have
an Aversion to neither: On the contrary, I
am a great Admirer of both. But my Ideas
of Amusements and Grandeur are probably
different from yours.</P>
<P>I will allow the Ladies to be sollicitous about
their Habits, and dress with all the Care and
Elegance they are capable of; but such Trifles
are below the Consideration of a Man, who
ought not to owe the Dignity of his Appear∣ance
to the Embroidery on his Coat, but to
his high and noble Air, the Grandeur of his
Courage, the Elevation of his Sentiments, and
the many heroick Actions he has perform'd.</P>
<P>Such a Man will dress his Person with a
graceful Simplicity, and lavish all his Gold and
Embroidery upon his Armour, to render him
conspicuous in the Day of Battle. The Plumes
in his Helmet will look more graceful in the
<PB N="163" REF="165"/>
Field, than the Feather in his Hat at a Ball;
and Jewels blaze with more Propriety on his
Shield and Cuirass in Battle, than glittering on
his Finger in a Dance.</P>
<P>Do not imagine, however, pursued she, that
I absolutely condemn Dancing, and think it a
Diversion wholly unworthy of a Hero.</P>
<P>History has recorded some very famous Balls,
at which the most illustrious Persons in the
World have appear'd.</P>
<P><HI>Cyrus</HI> the Great, we are inform'd, open'd a
Ball with the divine <HI>Mandana</HI> at <HI>Sardis.</HI> The
renown'd King of <HI>Scythia</HI> danc'd with the
Princess <HI>Cleopatra</HI> at <HI>Alexandria.</HI> The brave
<HI>Cleomedon</HI> with the fair <HI>Candace</HI> at <HI>Ethiopia;</HI>
but these Diversions were taken but seldom,
and consider'd indeed as an Amusement, not as
a Part of the Business of Life.</P>
<P>How would so many glorious Battles have
been fought, Cities taken, Ladies rescu'd, and
other great and noble Adventures been atchiev'd,
if the Men, sunk in Sloth and Effeminacy, had
continually follow'd the Sound of a Fiddle,
saunter'd in Publick Walks, and tattled over a
Tea-table.</P>
<P>I vow, Cousin, said Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> you are
infinitely more severe in your Censures than
Mr. <HI>Tinsel</HI> was at the Assembly. You had lit∣tle
Reason methinks to be angry with him.</P>
<P>All I have said, reply'd <HI>Arabella,</HI> were the
natural Inference from your own Account of
the Manner in which People live here. When
Actions are a Censure upon themselves, the Re∣citer
will always be consider'd as a Satirist.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which our Heroine justifies her own
Notions by some very illustrious Ex∣amples.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR. <HI>Selvin</HI> and Mr. <HI>Tinsel,</HI> who had listen'd
attentively to this Discourse of <HI>Ara∣bella,</HI>
took Leave as soon as it was ended,
and went away with very different Opinions
of her.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Tinsel</HI> declaring she was a Fool, and had
no Knowledge of the World, and Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI>
convinc'd she was a Wit, and very learn'd in
Antiquity.</P>
<P>Certainly, said Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI> in Support of his
Opinion, the Lady has great Judgment; has
been capable of prodigious Application, as is
apparent by her extensive Reading: Then her
Memory is quite miraculous. I protest, I am
quite charm'd with her: I never met with
such a Woman in my Life.</P>
<P>Her Cousin, in my Opinion, reply'd Mr.
<HI>Tinsel,</HI> is infinitely beyond her in every Merit,
but Beauty. How sprightly and free her Con∣versation?
What a thorough Knowledge of
the World? So true a Taste for polite Amuse∣ments,
and a Fund of Spirits that sets Vapours
and Spleen at Defiance.</P>
<P>This Speech bringing on a Comparison be∣tween
the Ladies, the Champions for each grew
so warm in the Dispute, that they had like to
have quarrell'd. However, by the Interposition
<PB N="165" REF="167"/>
of some other Gentlemen who were with them,
they parted tolerable Friends that Night, and
renew'd their Visits to Sir <HI>Charles</HI> in the Morn∣ing.</P>
<P>They found only Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> with her
Father and Brother. <HI>Arabella</HI> generally spent
the Mornings in her own Chamber, where
Reading and the Labours of the Toilet em∣ploy'd
her Time till Dinner: Tho' it must be
confess'd to her Honour, that the latter en∣gross'd
but a very small Part of it.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> with whom the Beau had a
long Conversation at one of the Windows;
in which he recounted his Dispute with Mr.
<HI>Selvin,</HI> and the Danger he ran of being pink'd
in a Duel, that was his Phrase, for her Sake,
at last propos'd a Walk; to which she con∣sented,
and engag'd to prevail upon <HI>Arabella</HI> to
accompany them.</P>
<P>That Lady at first positively refus'd; al∣leging
in Excuse, That she was so extremely
interested in the Fate of the Princess <HI>Melisintha,</HI>
whose Story she was reading, that she could not
stir till she had finish'd it.</P>
<P>That poor Princess, continu'd she, is at pre∣sent
in a most terrible Situation. She has just
set Fire to the Palace, in order to avoid the
Embraces of a King who forc'd her to marry
him. I am in Pain to know how she escapes
the Flames.</P>
<P>Pshaw, interrupted Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> let her
perish there, if she will: Don't let her hinder
our Walk.</P>
<P>Who is it you doom with so much Cruelty
to perish, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> closing the Book, and
<PB N="166" REF="168"/>
looking stedfastly on her Cousin? Is it the beau∣tiful
<HI>Melisintha,</HI> that Princess, whose Fortitude
and Patience have justly render'd her the Admi∣ration
of the whole World? That Princess,
descended from a Race of Heroes, whose he∣roick
Virtues all glow'd in her own beauteous
Breast; that Princess, who, when taken Cap∣tive
with the King her Father, bore her Im∣prisonment
and Chains with a marvellous Con∣stancy;
and who, when she enslaved her Con∣queror,
and given Fetters to the Prince who
held her Father and herself in Bonds, nobly
refus'd the Diadem he proffer'd her, and devoted
herself to Destruction, in order to punish the
Enemy of her House. I am not able to relate
the rest of her History, seeing I have read no
further myself; but if you will be pleased to
sit down and listen to me while I read what re∣mains,
I am persuaded you will find new Cause
to love and admire this amiable Princess.</P>
<P>Pardon me, Madam, said Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> I
have heard enough; and I could have been
very well satisfy'd not to have heard so much.
I think we waste a great deal of Time talking
about People we know nothing of. The Morn∣ing
will be quite lost, if we don't make Haste.
Come, added she, you must go: You have a
new Lover below, who waits to go with us;
he'll die if I don't bring you.</P>
<P>A new Lover! return'd <HI>Arabella,</HI> surpriz'd.</P>
<P>Aye, aye, said Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> the learned
Mr. <HI>Selvin;</HI> I assure you, he had almost quar∣rell'd
with Mr. <HI>Tinsel</HI> last Night about your
Ladyship.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="169"/>
<HI>Arabella,</HI> at this Intelligence, casting down
her Eyes, discover'd many Signs of Anger and
Confusion: And after a Silence of some Mo∣ments,
during which, Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> had been
employ'd in adjusting her Dress at the Glass,
addressing herself to her Cousin with an Accent
somewhat less sweet than before.</P>
<P>Had any other than yourself, Miss, said she,
acquainted me with the Presumption of that
unfortunate Person, I should haply have disco∣ver'd
my Resentment in other Terms: But, as
it is, must inform you, that I take it extremely
ill, you should be accessary to giving me this
Offence.</P>
<P>Hey day! said Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> turning about
hastily, How have I offended your Ladyship,
pray?</P>
<P>I am willing to hope, Cousin, reply'd <HI>Ara∣bella,</HI>
that it was only to divert yourself with
the Trouble and Confusion in which you see
me, that you have indiscreetly told Things
which ought to have been bury'd in Silence.</P>
<P>And what is all this mighty Trouble and
Confusion about then, Madam, said Miss
<HI>Glanville,</HI> smiling? Is it because I told you,
Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> was a Lover of your Ladyship?</P>
<P>Certainly, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> such an Information
is sufficient to give one a great deal of Perplexi∣ty.
Is it such a little Matter, think you, to
be told that a Man has the Presumption to love
one?</P>
<P>A meer Trifle, reply'd Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> laugh∣ing;
a hundred Lovers are not worth a Mo∣ment's
Thought, when one's sure of them, for
then the Trouble is all over. And as for this
<PB N="168" REF="170"/>
unfortunate Person, as your Ladyship called
him, let him die at his Leisure, while we go
to the Parade.</P>
<P>Your Levity, Cousin, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> forces
me to smile, notwithstanding the Cause I have
to be incens'd; however, I have Charity enough
to make me not desire the Death of Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI>
who may repair the Crime he has been guilty
of by Repentance and Discontinuation.</P>
<P>Well then, said Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> you are re∣solv'd
to go to the Parade: Shall I reach you
your odd Kind of Capuchin?</P>
<P>How, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> can I with any Pro∣priety
see a Man who has discover'd himself to
have a Passion for me? Will he not construe
such a Favour into a Permission for him to
hope?</P>
<P>Oh! no, interrupted Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> he does
not imagine I have told your Ladyship he loves
you; for indeed he don't know that I am ac∣quainted
with his Passion.</P>
<P>Then he is less culpable than I thought him,
reply'd <HI>Arabella;</HI> and if you think I am in no
Danger of hearing a Confession of his Fault
from his own Mouth, I'll comply with your
Request, and go with you to the Parade. But
added she, I must first engage you to promise
not to leave me alone a Moment, lest he should
take Advantage of such an Opportunity, to
give some Hint of his Passion, that would force
me to treat him very rigorously.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> answer'd laughing, That she
would be sure to mind her Directions. How∣ever,
said she, your Ladyship need not be ap∣prehensive
he will say any fine Things to you;
<PB N="169" REF="171"/>
for I knew a young Lady he was formerly in
Love with, and the odious Creature visited her
a Twelve-month before he found Courage
enough to tell her she was handsome.</P>
<P>Doubtless, reply'd <HI>Arabella,</HI> he was much
to be commended for his Respect. A Lover
should never have the Presumption to declare
his Passion to his Mistress, unless in certain
Circumstances, which may at the same Time
in part disarm her Anger. For Instance, he
must struggle with the Violence of his Passion,
till it has cast him into a Fever. His Physi∣cians
must give him over, pronouncing his Di∣stemper
incurable, since the Cause of it being
in his Mind, all their Art is incapable of re∣moving
it. Thus he must suffer, rejoicing at
the Approach of Death, which will free him
from all his Torments, without violating the
Respect he owes to the Divine Object of his
Flame. At length, when he has but a few
Hours to live, his Mistress, with many Signs
of Compassion, conjures him to tell her the
Cause of his Despair. The Lover, conscious
of his Crime, evades all her Inquiries; but the
Lady laying at last a peremptory Command
upon him to disclose the Secret, he dares not
disobey her, and acknowledges his Passion with
the utmost Contrition for having offended her;
bidding her take the small Remainder of his
Life to expiate his Crime; and finishes his
Discourse by falling into a Swoon.</P>
<P>The Lady is touch'd at his Condition, com∣mands
him to live, and if necessary, permits
him to hope.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="172"/>
This is the most common Way in which
such Declarations are, and ought to be brought
about. However, there are others, which are
as well calculated for sparing a Lady's Confu∣sion,
and deprecating her Wrath.</P>
<P>The Lover, for Example, like the Prince
of the <HI>Massage<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es,</HI> after having buried his Pas∣sion
in Silence for many Years, may chance to
be walking with his Confidant in a retir'd
Place; to whom, with a Deluge of Tears, he
relates the Excess of his Passion and Despair.
And while he is thus unbosoming his Griefs,
not in the least suspecting he is overheard, his
Princess, who had been listning to him in much
Trouble and Confusion, by some little Rustling
she makes, unawares discovers herself.</P>
<P>The surpriz'd Lover throws himself at her
Feet, begs Pardon for his Rashness, observes
that he had never presum'd to discover his
Passion to her; and implores her Leave to die
before her, as a Punishment for his undesign'd
Offence.</P>
<P>The Method which the great <HI>Artamenes</HI> took
to let the Princess of <HI>Media</HI> know he adored
her, was not less respectful. This valiant Prince,
who had long loved her, being to fight a great
Battle, in which he had some secret Presages he
should fall, which however deceiv'd him, wrote
a long Letter to the divine <HI>Mandana,</HI> wherein
he discover'd his Passion, and the Resolution his
Respect had inspir'd him with, to consume in
Silence, and never presume to disclose his Love
while he lived; acquainting her, that he had
order'd that Letter not to be deliver'd to her,
till it was certainly known that he was dead.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="173"/>
Accordingly he receiv'd several Wounds in
the Fight, which brought him to the Ground,
and his Body not being found, they concluded
it was in the Enemy's Possession.</P>
<P>His faithful 'Squire, who had receiv'd his In∣structions
before the Battle, hastens to the Prin∣cess,
who, with all the Court, is mightily af∣fected
at his Death.</P>
<P>He presents her the Letter, which she makes
no Scruple to receive, since the Writer is no
more. She reads it, and her whole Soul is
melted with Compassion; she bewails his Fate
with the most tender and affectionate Marks of
Grief.</P>
<P>Her Confidant asks why she is so much af∣fected,
since in all Probability, she would not
have pardon'd him for loving her, had he been
alive?</P>
<P>She acknowledges the Truth of her Observa∣tion,
takes Notice that his Death having can∣cell'd
his Crime, his respectful Passion alone
employs her Thoughts; she is resolv'd to be∣wail
as innocent and worthy of Compassion
when dead, whom living she would treat as a
Criminal, and insinuates, that her Heart had
entertain'd an Affection for him.</P>
<P>Her Confidant treasures up this Hint, and
endeavours to console her, but in vain, till News
is brought, that <HI>Artamenes,</HI> who had been car∣ry'd
for dead out of the Field, and by a very
surprizing Adventure conceal'd all this Time,
is return'd.</P>
<P>The Princess is cover'd with Confusion, and
tho' glad he is alive, resolves to banish him for
his Crime.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="174"/>
Her Confidant pleads his Cause so well, that
she consents to see him; and, since he can no
longer conceal his Passion, he confirms the Con∣fession
in his Letter, humbly begging Pardon
for being still alive.</P>
<P>The Princess, who cannot plead Ignorance
of his Passion, nor deny the Sorrow she testify'd
for his Death, condescends to pardon him, and
he is also permitted to hope. In like Manner
the great Prince of <HI>Persia</HI>—</P>
<P>Does your Ladyship consider how late it is,
interrupted Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> who had hitherto
very impatiently listen'd to her? Don't let us
keep the Gentlemen waiting any longer for us.</P>
<P>I must inform you how the Prince of <HI>Persia</HI>
declar'd his Love for the incomparable <HI>Berenice,</HI>
said <HI>Arabella.</HI></P>
<P>Another Time, dear Cousin, said Miss
<HI>Glanville;</HI> methinks we have talk'd long enough
upon this Subject.</P>
<P>I am sorry the Time has seem'd so tedious to
you, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> smiling; and therefore I'll
trespass no longer upon your Patience. Then
ordering <HI>Lucy</HI> to bring her Hat and Gloves, she
went down Stairs, follow'd by Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI>
who was greatly disappointed at her not putting
on her Veil.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which our Heroine being mistaken her∣self,
gives Oceasion for a great many
other Mistakes.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS soon as the Ladies enter'd the Room,
Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI> with more Gaiety than usual,
advanc'd towards <HI>Arabella,</HI> who put on so cold
and severe a Countenance at his Approach, that
the poor Man, extreamly confus'd, drew back,
and remain'd in great Perplexity, fearing he had
offended her.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Tinsel,</HI> seeing Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI>'s Reception,
and aw'd by the becoming Majesty in her Per∣son,
notwithstanding all his Assurance, accosted
her with less Confidence than was his Custom;
but <HI>Arabella</HI> softning her Looks with the most
engaging Smiles, made an Apology for detain∣ing
them so long from the Parade, gave her
Hand to the Beau, as being not a suspected
Person, and permitted him to lead her out.
Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> to whom she always allow'd the
Preference on those Occasions, being a little in∣dispos'd,
and not able to attend her.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Tinsel,</HI> whose Vanity was greatly flat∣ter'd
by the Preference <HI>Arabella</HI> gave him to
his Companion, proceeded according to his
usual Custom, to examine her Looks and Be∣haviour
with more Care; conceiving such a
Preference must proceed from a latent Motive
which was not unfavourable for him. His
Discernment on these Occasions being very sur∣prising,
<PB N="174" REF="176"/>
he soon discover'd in the bright Eyes of
<HI>Arabella</HI> a secret Approbation of his Person,
which he endeavour'd to increase by displaying
it with all the Address he was Master of, and
did not fail to talk her into an Opinion of his
Wit, by ridiculing every Body that pass'd them,
and directing several study'd Compliments to
herself.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> who was not so agreeably en∣tertain'd
by the grave Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI> saw these
Advances to a Gallantry with her Cousin with
great Disturbance: She was resolved to in∣terrupt
it if possible, and being convinc'd
Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> preferr'd <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Conversation to
hers, she plotted how to pair them together,
and have the Beau to herself.</P>
<P>As they walk'd a few Paces behind her Cousin
and Mr. <HI>Tinsel,</HI> she was in no Danger of be∣ing
over-heard; and taking Occasion to put
Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> in mind of <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Behaviour to
him, when he accosted her; she ask'd him, if
he was conscious of having done any thing to
offend her?</P>
<P>I protest, Madam, reply'd Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI> I know
not of any thing I have done to displease her.
I never fail'd, to my Knowledge, in my Re∣spects
towards her Ladyship, for whom indeed
I have a most profound Veneration.</P>
<P>I know so much of her Temper, resum'd
Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> as to be certain, if she has taken
it into her Head to be angry with you, she will
be ten times more so at your Indifference: And
if you hope for her Favour, you must ask her
Pardon with the most earnest Submission ima∣ginable.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="177"/>
If I knew I had offended her, reply'd
Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI> I would very willingly ask her Par∣don;
but really, since I have not been guilty
of any Fault towards her Ladyship, I don't
know how to acknowledge it.</P>
<P>Well, said Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> coldly, I only
took the Liberty to give you some friendly Ad∣vice,
which you may follow, or not, as you
please. I know my Cousin is angry at some∣thing,
and I wish you were Friends again,
that's all.</P>
<P>I am mightily oblig'd to you, Madam, said
Mr. <HI>Selvin;</HI> and since you assure me her Lady∣ship
is angry, I'll ask her Pardon, tho', really,
as I said before, I don't know for what.</P>
<P>Well, interrupted Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> we'll join
them at the End of the Parade; and to give
you an Opportunity of speaking to my Cousin,
I'll engage Mr. <HI>Tinsel</HI> myself.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI> who thought himself greatly
oblig'd to Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> for her good Intentions,
tho' in reality she had a View of exposing of
her Cousin, as well as an Inclination to engage
Mr. <HI>Tinsel,</HI> took Courage as they turn'd, to get
on the other Side of <HI>Arabella,</HI> whom he had not
dar'd before to approach, while Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI>
addressing a Whisper of no great Importance to
her Cousin, parted her from the Beau, and
slackning her Pace a little, fell into a particular
Discourse with him, which <HI>Arabella</HI> being too
polite to interrupt, remain'd in a very perplex∣ing
Situation, dreading every Moment that
Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> would explain himself. Alarm'd at
his Silence, yet resolv'd to interrupt him if he
began to speak, and afraid of beginning a Con∣versation
<PB N="176" REF="178"/>
first, lest he should construe it to his
Advantage.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> being naturally timid in the Com∣pany
of Ladies, the Circumstance of Disgrace
which he was in with <HI>Arabella,</HI> her Silence and
Reserve so added to his accustom'd Diffidence,
that tho' he endeavour'd several times to speak,
he was not able to bring out any thing but a
preluding Hem; which he observ'd, to his ex∣treme
Confusion, seem'd always to encrease
<HI>Arabella</HI>'s Constraint.</P>
<P>Indeed, that Lady, upon any Suspicion that
he was going to break his mysterious Silence,
always contracted her Brow into a Frown, cast
down her Eyes with an Air of Perplexity, en∣deavour'd
to hide her Blushes with her Fan;
and to shew her In-attention, directed her Looks
to the contrary Side.</P>
<P>The Lady and Gentleman being in equal
Confusion, no Advances were made on either
Side towards a Conversation, and they had
reach'd almost the End of the Parade in an un∣interrupted
Silence; when Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI> fearing he
should never again have so good an Opportu∣nity
of making his Peace, collected all his Re∣solution,
and with an Accent trembling under
the Importance of the Speech he was going to
make, began,</P>
<P>Madam, Since I have had the Honour of
walking with your Ladyship, I have observed
so many Signs of Constraint in your Manner,
that I hardly dare intreat you to grant me a
Moment's Hearing while I—</P>
<P>Sir, interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> before you go any
further, I must inform you, that what you are
<PB N="177" REF="179"/>
going to say will mortally offend me. Take
heed then how you commit an Indiscretion
which will force me to treat you very rigorously.</P>
<P>If your Ladyship will not allow me to speak
in my own Justification, said Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI> yet I
hope you will not refuse to tell me my Offence,
since I—</P>
<P>You are very confident, indeed, interrupted
<HI>Arabella,</HI> again, to suppose I will repeat what
would be infinitely grievous for me to hear.
Against my Will, pursued she, I must give you
the Satisfaction to know, that I am not igno∣rant
of your Crime, but I also assure you that I
am highly incens'd; and that, not only with the
Thoughts you have dar'd to entertain of me,
but likewise with your Presumption in going
about to disclose them.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI> whom the seeming Contradictions
in this Speech astonish'd, yet imagin'd in ge∣neral
it hinted at the Dispute between him and
Mr. <HI>Tinsel;</HI> and supposing the Story had been
told to his Disadvantage, which was the Cause
of her Anger, reply'd in great Emotion at the
Injustice done him.</P>
<P>Since somebody has been so officious to ac∣quaint
your Ladyship with an Affair which
ought to have been kept from your Knowledge;
'tis a Pity they did not inform you, that
Mr. <HI>Tinsel</HI> was the Person that had the least
Respect for your Ladyship, and is more worthy
of your Resentment.</P>
<P>If Mr. <HI>Tinsel,</HI> replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> is guilty of
an Offence like yours, yet since he has con∣ceal'd
it better, he is less culpable than you;
and you have done that for him, which haply
<PB N="178" REF="180"/>
he would never have had Courage enough to do
for himself as long as he lived.</P>
<P>Poor <HI>Selvin,</HI> quite confounded at these intri∣cate
Words, would have begg'd her to explain
herself, had she not silenc'd him with a dreadful
Frown: Aand making a Stop till Miss <HI>Glanville</HI>
and Mr. <HI>Tinsel</HI> came up to them. She told her
Cousin with a peevish Accent, that she had
perform'd her Promise very ill; and whisper'd
her, that she was to blame for all the Mortifi∣cations
she had suffer'd.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Tinsel,</HI> supposing the Alteration in
<HI>Arabella</HI>'s Humour proceeded from being so long
depriv'd of his Company; endeavour'd to make
her Amends by a Profusion of Compliments;
which she receiv'd with such an Air of Dis∣pleasure,
that the Beau, vex'd at the ill Success of
his Gallantry, told her, he was afraid Mr. <HI>Sel∣vin</HI>'s
Gravity had infected her Ladyship.</P>
<P>Say rather, reply'd <HI>Arabella,</HI> that his Indis∣cretion
has offended me.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Tinsel,</HI> charm'd with this beginning Con∣fidence,
which confirm'd his Hopes of having
made fome Impression on her Heart; conjur'd
her very earnestly to tell him how Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI>
had offended her.</P>
<P>'Tis sufficient, resum'd she, that I tell you
he has offended me, without declaring the Na∣ture
of his Crime, since doubtless it has not
escaped your Observation, which, if I may
believe him, is not wholly disinterested. To
confess yet more, 'tis true that he hath told me
something concerning you, which—</P>
<P>Let me perish, Madam, interrupted the
Beau, if one Syllable he has said be true.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="181"/>
How, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> a little disconcerted,
Will you always persist in a Denial then?</P>
<P>Deny it, Madam, return'd Mr. <HI>Tinsel,</HI> I'll
deny what he has said with my last Breath; 'tis
all a scandalous Forgery: No Man living is less
likely to think of your Ladyship in that Man∣ner.
If you knew my Thoughts, Madam,
you would be convinc'd nothing is more im∣possible,
and—</P>
<P>Sir, interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> extremely morti∣fy'd,
methinks you are very eager in your Ju∣stification.
I promise you, I do not think you
guilty of the Offence he charg'd you with; if
I did, you would haply experience my Resent∣ment
in such a Manner, as would make you
repent of your Presumption.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> in finishing these Words, inter∣rupted
Miss <HI>Glanville</HI>'s Discourse with Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI>
to tell her, she desir'd to return Home; to
which that young Lady, who had not been at
all pleas'd with the Morning's Walk, consented.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which our Heroine reconciles herself to
a mortifying Incident, by recollecting an
Adventure in a Romance, similar to her
own.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS soon as the Ladies were come to their
Lodgings, <HI>Arabella</HI> went up to her own
Apartment to meditate upon what had pass'd,
and Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> retir'd to dress for Dinner;
<PB N="180" REF="182"/>
while the two Gentlemen, who thought they
had great Reason to be dissatisfy'd with each
other on Account of Lady <HI>Bella</HI>'s Behaviour,
went to a Coffee-house, in order to come to
some Explanation about it,</P>
<P>Well, Sir, said the Beau, with a sarcastick
Air, I am greatly oblig'd to you for the Endea∣vours
you have us'd to ruin me in Lady <HI>Bella</HI>'s
Opinion. Rat me, if it is not the greatest
Misfortune in the World, to give occasion for
Envy.</P>
<P>Envy, Sir, interrupted Mr. <HI>Selvin;</HI> I protest
I do really admire your great Skill in Strata∣gems,
but I do not envy you the Possession of
it. You have, indeed, very wittily contriv'd
to put your own Sentiments of that Lady,
which you deliver'd so freely the other Night,
into my Mouth. 'Twas a Master-piece of
Cunning, indeed; and, as I said before, I ad∣mire
your Skill prodigiously.</P>
<P>I don't know what you mean, reply'd <HI>Tinsel,</HI>
y<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u talk in Riddles. Did you not yourself ac∣quaint
Lady <HI>Bella</HI> with the Preference I gave
Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> to her? What would you pro∣pose
by such a Piece of Treachery? You have
ruin'd all my Hopes by it: The Lady resents
it excessively, and it's no Wonder, 'faith, it
must certainly mortify her. Upon my Soul, I
can never forgive thee for so <HI>mal a propos</HI> a
Discovery.</P>
<P>Forgive me, Sir, replied <HI>Selvin,</HI> in a Rage,
I don't want your Forgiveness. I have done
nothing unbecoming a Man of Honour. The
Lady was so prejudiced by your Insinuations,
that she would not give me Leave to speak;
<PB N="181" REF="183"/>
otherwise, I would have fully inform'd her of
her Mistake, that she might have known how
much she was oblig'd to you.</P>
<P>So she would not hear thee, interrupted <HI>Tinsel</HI>
laughing, dear Soul, how very kind was that?
'Faith, I don't know how it is, but I am very
lucky, without deserving to be so. Thou art
a Witness for me, <HI>Frank,</HI> I took no great Pains
to gain this fine Creature's Heart; but it was
damn'd malicious tho', to attempt to make
Discoveries. I see she is a little piqu'd, but
I'll set all to rights again with a <HI>Billet-doux.</HI> I've
an excellent Hand, tho' I say it, at a <HI>Billet-doux.</HI>
I never knew one of mine fail in my Life.</P>
<P>Harky, Sir, said <HI>Selvin</HI> whispering, any
more Attempts to shift your Sentiments upon
me, and you shall hear of it. In the mean
Time, be assur'd, I'll clear myself, and put the
Saddle upon the right Horse.</P>
<P>Demme, if thou art not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> queer Fellow,
said <HI>Tinsel,</HI> endeavouring to hide his Discompo∣sure
at this Threat under a forc'd Laugh.</P>
<P><HI>Selvin,</HI> without making any Reply, retir'd
to write to <HI>Arabella;</HI> which <HI>Tinsel</HI> suspecting,
resolv'd to be before hand with him; and with∣out
leaving the Coffee-house, call'd for Paper,
and wrote a Billet to her, which he dispatch'd
away immediately.</P>
<P>The Messenger had just got Admittance to
<HI>Lucy,</HI> when another arriv'd from <HI>Selvin.</HI></P>
<P>They both presented their Letters, but <HI>Lucy</HI>
refus'd them, saying, her Lady would turn her
away, if she receiv'd such Sort of Letters.</P>
<P>Such Sort of Letters, return'd <HI>Tinsel</HI>'s Man!
Why, do you know what they contain, then?</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="184"/>
To be sure, I do, reply'd <HI>Lucy;</HI> they are
Love-Letters; and my Lady has charg'd me
never to receive any more.</P>
<P>Well, reply'd <HI>Selvin</HI>'s Servant, you may take
my Letter; for my Master desir'd me to tell
you, it was about Business of Consequence,
which your Lady must be acquainted with.</P>
<P>Since you assure me it is not a Love-Letter,
I'll take it, said <HI>Lucy.</HI></P>
<P>And, pray take mine too, said <HI>Tinsel</HI>'s <HI>Mer∣cury;</HI>
for I assure you, it is not a Love-Letter
neither; it's only a <HI>Billet-doux.</HI></P>
<P>Are you sure of that, reply'd <HI>Lucy;</HI> because
I may venture to take it, I fancy, if its what
you say.</P>
<P>I'll swear it, said the Man delivering it to
her. Well, said she, receiving it, I'll take
them both up. But what did you call this,
pursu'd she? I must not forget it, or else my
Lady will think it a Love-Letter.</P>
<P>A <HI>Billet-doux,</HI> said the Man.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy,</HI> for fear she should forget it, repeated
the Words <HI>Billet-doux</HI> several Times as she went
up Stairs; but entering her Lady's Apartment,
she perceiving the Letters in her Hand, ask'd
her so sternly, how she durst presume to bring
them into her Presence, that the poor Girl, in
her Fright, forgot the Lesson she had been con∣ning;
and endeavouring to recal it into her
Memory, took no Notice of her Lady's Que∣stion,
which she repeated several times, but to
no Purpose.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> surpriz'd at her in-attention, re∣iterated
her Commands, in a Tone somewhat
<PB N="183" REF="185"/>
louder than usual; asking her at the same Time,
why she did not obey her immediately?</P>
<P>Indeed, Madam, reply'd <HI>Lucy,</HI> your Lady∣ship
would not order me to take back the Let∣ters,
if you knew what they were: They are
not Love-Letters; I was resolv'd to be sure of
that before I took them. This, Madam, is a
Letter about Business of Consequence; and the
other—Oh dear! I can't think what the
Man call'd it! But it is not a Love-Letter, in∣deed,
Madam.</P>
<P>You are a simple Wench, said <HI>Arabella</HI>
smiling: You may depend upon it, all Letters
directed to me, must contain Matters of Love
and Gallantry; and those I am not permitted
to receive. Take them away then immediately.
But stay, pursued she, seeing she was about to
obey her, one of them, you say, was deliver'd
to you as a Letter of Consequence; perhaps i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
is so: Indeed it may contain an Advertisement
of some Design to carry me away. How do I
know, but Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI> incited by his Love and
Despair, may intend to make such an Attempt.
Give me that Letter, <HI>Lucy,</HI> I am resolved to
open it. As for the other—yet who knows
but the other may also bring me Warning of
the same Danger from another Quarter. The
Pains Mr. <HI>Tinsel</HI> took to conceal his Passion,
nay, almost as I think, to deny it, amounts to
a Proof that he is meditating some Way to
make sure of me. 'Tis certainly so: Give me
that Letter, <HI>Lucy;</HI> I should be accessary to
their intended Violence, if I neglected this
timely Discovery.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="186"/>
Well, cried she, taking one of the Letters,
this is exactly like what happen'd to the beauti∣ful
Princess of <HI>Cappadocia;</HI> who, like me, in
one and the same Day, receiv'd Advice that
two of her Lovers intended to carry her off.</P>
<P>As she pronounc'd these Words Miss <HI>Glanville</HI>
enter'd the Room, to whom <HI>Arabella</HI> immedi∣ately
recounted the Adventure of the Letters;
telling her, she did not doubt, but they contain'd
a Discovery of some Conspiracy to carry her
away.</P>
<P>And whom does your Ladyship suspect of such
a strange Design, pray, said Miss <HI>Glanville</HI>
smiling?</P>
<P>At present, reply'd <HI>Arabella,</HI> the two Cava∣liers
who walk'd with us to Day, are the Per∣sons
who seem the most likely to attempt that
Violence.</P>
<P>I dare answer for Mr. <HI>Tinsel,</HI> replied Miss
<HI>Glanville,</HI> he thinks of no such Thing.</P>
<P>Well, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> to convince you of your
Mistake, I must inform you, that Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI>
having the Presumption to begin a Declaration
of Love to me on the Parade this Morning, I
reprov'd him severely for his Want of Respect,
and threatned him with my Displeasure; in the
Rage of his Jealousy, at seeing me treat
Mr. <HI>Tinsel</HI> well, he discover'd to me, that he
also was as criminal as himself, in order to
oblige me to a severer Usage of him.</P>
<P>So he told you Mr. <HI>Tinsel</HI> was in Love with
you, interrupted Miss <HI>Glanville?</HI></P>
<P>He told it me in other Words, reply'd <HI>Arabella;</HI>
for he said, Mr. <HI>Tinsel</HI> was guilty of that Of∣fence,
which I resented so severely to him.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="187"/>
Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> beginning to comprehend the
Mystery, with great Difficulty forbore laugh∣ing
at her Cousin's Mistake; for she well knew
the Offence Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> hinted at, and desirous
of knowing what those Letters contain'd, she
begg'd her to delay opening them no longer.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> pleas'd at her Solicitude, open'd
one of the Letters; but glancing her Eye to
the Bottom, and seeing the Name of <HI>Selvin,</HI>
she threw it hastily upon the Table, and avert∣ing
her Eyes, What a Mortification have I
avoided, said she, that Letter is from <HI>Selvin;</HI>
and questionless, contains an Avowal of his
Crime.</P>
<P>Nay, you must read it, cried Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI>
taking it up; since you have open'd it, its the
same Thing: You can never persuade him but
you have seen it. However, to spare your
Nicety, I'll read it to you. Which accordingly
she did, and found it as follows.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">

<P>I Knows not what Insinuations have been
made use of to persuade you I was guilty
of the Offence, which, with Justice, occa∣sion'd
your Resentment this Morning; but
I assure you, nothing was ever more false.
My Thoughts of your Ladyship are very
different, and full of the profoundest Re∣spect
and Veneration. I have Reason to
suspect Mr. <HI>Tinsel</HI> is the Person who has thus
endeavoured to prejudice me with your La∣dyship;
therefore I am excusable if I tell
you, that those very Sentiments, too dis∣respectful
to be named, which he would per∣suade
<PB N="186" REF="188"/>

He then, Madam, is the Person guilty of

<CLOSER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>Your Ladyship's
most obedient, and
most humble Servant,
F. SELVIN.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>How's this, cry'd Miss <HI>Glanville?</HI> Why,
Madam, you are certainly mistaken. You see
Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> utterly denies the Crime of loving
you. He has suffer'd very innocently in your
Opinion. Indeed, your Ladyship was too hasty
in condemning him.</P>
<P>If what he says be true, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI>
who had been in extream Confusion, while a
Letter so different from what she expected was
reading; I have indeed unjustly condemn'd
him. Nevertheless, I am still inclin'd to be∣lieve
this is all Artifice; and that he is really
guilty of entertaining a Passion for me.</P>
<P>But why should he take so much Pains to
deny it, Madam, said Miss <HI>Glanville?</HI> Methinks
that looks very odd.</P>
<P>Not at all, interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> whose Spi∣rits
were rais'd by recollecting an Adventure in
her Romance, similar to this. Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> has
fallen upon the very same Stratagem with <HI>Sera∣menes;</HI>
who being in Love with the beautiful
<HI>Cleobuline,</HI> Princess of <HI>Corinth,</HI> took all ima∣ginable
Pains to conceal his Passion, in order
<PB N="187" REF="189"/>
to be near that fair Princess; who would have
banish'd him from her Presence, had she known
he was in Love with her. Nay, he went so
far in his Dissimulation, as to pretend Love to
one of the Ladies of her Court; that his Pas∣sion
for the Princess might be the less taken no∣tice
of. In these Cases therefore, the more re∣solutely
a Man denies his Passion, the more
pure and violent it is.</P>
<P>Then Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI>'s Passion is certainly very
violent, reply'd Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> for he denies it
very resolutely; and I believe none but your
Ladyship would have discover'd his Artifice.
But shall we not open the other Letter? I have
a strong Notion it comes from <HI>Tinsel.</HI></P>
<P>For that very Reason I would not be ac∣quainted
with the Contents, reply'd <HI>Arabella,</HI>
You see, Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> accuses him of being guilty
of that Offence which he denies: I shall doubt∣less,
meet with a Confirmation of his Love in
that Letter. Do not, I beseech you added
she, seeing her Cousin preparing to open the
Letter, expose me to the Pain of hearing a pre∣sumptuous
Declaration of Love. Nay, pur∣sued
she, rising in great Emotion, if you are
resolved to persecute me by reading it, I'll en∣deavour
to get out of the hearing of it.</P>
<P>You shan't, I declare, said Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI>
laughing and holding her, I'll oblige you to
hear it.</P>
<P>I vow, Cousin, said <HI>Arabella</HI> smiling, you
use me just as the Princess <HI>Cleopatra</HI> did the fair
and wise <HI>Antonia.</HI> However, if by this you
mean to do any Kindness to the unfortunate
Person who wrote that Billet, you are greatly
<PB N="188" REF="190"/>
mistaken; since, if you oblige me to listen to
a Declaration of his Crime, you will lay me
under a Necessity to banish him. A Sentence
he would have avoided, while I remained ig∣norant
of it.</P>
<P>To this Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> made no other Reply
than by opening the Billet, the Contents of
which may be found in the following Chapter.</P>

<P>I Had the Honour to assure you this Morn∣ing

permitted to attend you to the Rooms this
Evening, I hope to convince you, that it
was absolutely impossible I could have been

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="189" REF="191"/>
Well, Madam, said Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> when
she had read this Epistle, I fancy you need not
pronounce a Sentence of Banishment upon poor
Mr. <HI>Tinsel;</HI> he seems to be quite innocent of
the Offence your Ladyship suspects him of.</P>
<P>Why, really, return'd <HI>Arabella,</HI> blushing
with extreme Confusion at this second Disap∣pointment,
I am greatly perplex'd to know
how I ought to act on this Occasion. I am
much in the same Situation with the Princess
<HI>Serena.</HI> For you must know, this Princess—
Here <HI>Lucy</HI> entering, inform'd the Ladies Din∣ner
was serv'd—I shall defer till another Op∣portunity,
said <HI>Arabella,</HI> upon this Interruption,
the Relation of the Princess <HI>Serena</HI>'s Adven∣tures;
which you will find, added she, in a low
Voice, bears a very great Resemblance to mine.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> reply'd, she would hear it
whenever she pleas'd, and then follow'd <HI>Arabella</HI>
to the Dining Room.</P>
<P>The Cloth was scarce remov'd, when
Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> came in. <HI>Arabella</HI> blush'd at his
Appearance, and discover'd so much Perplexity
in her Behaviour, that Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> was appre∣hensive
he had not yet sufficiently justify'd him∣self;
and therefore took the first Opportunity
to approach her.</P>
<P>I shall think myself very unhappy, Madam,
said he bowing, if the Letter I did myself the
Honour to write to you this Morning—</P>
<P>Sir, interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> I perceive you are
going to forget the Contents of that Letter,
and preparing again to offend me by a presump∣tuous
Declaration of Love.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="192"/>
Who I, Madam, reply'd he, in great Asto∣nishment
and Confusion, I-I-I protest—tho'
I-I have a very great Respect for your Lady∣ship,
yet—yet I never presum'd to—to—to—</P>
<P>You have presum'd too much, replied <HI>Ara∣bella,</HI>
and I should forget what I ow'd to my
own Glory, if I furnish'd you with any more
Occasions of offending me.—Know then, I
absolutely forbid you to appear before me again,
at least, till I am convinc'd you have chang'd
your Sentiments.</P>
<P>Saying this, she rose from her Seat, and
making a Sign to him not to follow her, which
indeed he had no Intention to do, she quitted
the Room, highly satisfy'd with her own Con∣duct
upon this Occasion, which was exactly
conformable to the Laws of Romance.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Tinsel,</HI> who had just alighted from his
Chair, having a Glimpse of her, as she pass'd
to her own Apartment, resolv'd, if possible, to
procure a private Interview; for he did not
doubt but his Billet had done Wonders in his
Favour.</P>
<P>For that Purpose he ventur'd up to her Anti-Chamber,
where he found <HI>Lucy</HI> in waiting,
whom he desir'd to acquaint her Lady, that he
intreated a Moment's Speech with her.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy,</HI> after hesitating a Moment, and look∣ing
earnestly at him, replied, Sir, if you'll
promise me faithfully, you are not in Love
with my Lady, I'll go and deliver your Mes∣sage.</P>
<P>Duce take me, said <HI>Tinsel,</HI> if that is not a
very whimsical Condition truly—Pray, my
Dear, how came it into thy little Brain, to
<PB N="191" REF="193"/>
suspect I was in Love with thy Lady? But,
suppose I should be in Love with her, what
then?</P>
<P>Why, then its likely you would die, that's
all, said <HI>Lucy,</HI> without my Lady would be so
kind to command you to live.</P>
<P>I vow thou hast mighty pretty Notions, Child,
said <HI>Tinsel</HI> smiling; hast thou been reading
any Play-Book lately? But pray, dost think
thy Lady would have compassion on me, if I
was in Love with her? Come, I know thou
art in her Confidence? Hast thou ever heard
her talk of me? Does she not tell thee all her
Secrets?</P>
<P>Here <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Bell ringing, the Beau slipp'd
half a Guinea into her Hand, which <HI>Lucy</HI> not
willing to refuse, went immediately to her
Lady; to whom, with a trembling Accent,
she repeated Mr. <HI>Tinsel</HI>'s Request.</P>
<P>Imprudent Girl, cried <HI>Arabella,</HI> for I am
loth to suspect thee of Disloyalty to thy Mistress.
Dost thou know the Nature and Extent of the
Request thou hast deliver'd? Art thou ignorant
that the presumptuous Man whom thou sollicitest
this Favour for, has mortally offended me?</P>
<P>Indeed, Madam, said <HI>Lucy</HI> frighted out of
her Wits, I don't sollicit for him. I scorn to do
any such Thing. I would not offend your
Ladyship for the World: For, before I would
deliver his Message to your Ladyship, I made
him assure me, that he was not in Love with
your Ladyship.</P>
<P>That was very wisely done, indeed, replied
<HI>Arabella,</HI> smiling: And do you believe he spoke
the Truth?</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="194"/>
Yes, indeed, I am sure of it, said <HI>Lucy</HI>
eagerly, if your Ladyship will but be pleas'd to
see him, he is only in the next Room; I dare
promise—</P>
<P>How, interrupted <HI>Arabella!</HI> What have you
done? Have you brought him into my Apart∣ment
then? I protest this Adventure is exactly
like what befel the beautiful <HI>Statira,</HI> when, by
a Stratagem of the same Kind, <HI>Oroondates</HI> was
introduc'd into her Presence. <HI>Lucy,</HI> thou art
another <HI>Barsina,</HI> I think; but I hope thy In∣tentions
are not less innocent than hers was.</P>
<P>Indeed, Madam, reply'd <HI>Lucy,</HI> excessively
uneasy at her Lady's Words, I am very inno∣cent,
I am no <HI>Barsina,</HI> as your Ladyship calls
me.</P>
<P>I dare answer for thee, said <HI>Arabella</HI> smiling
at the Turn she gave to her Words, thou art
no <HI>Barsina;</HI> and I should wrong thee very
much to compare thee with that wise Princess;
for thou art certainly one of the most simple
Wenches in the World. But since thou hast
gone so far, let me know what the unfortunate
Person desires of me; for, since I am neither
more rigid, nor pretend to more Virtue than
<HI>Statira,</HI> I may do at least as much for him, as
that great Queen did for <HI>Oroondates.</HI></P>
<P>He desires, Madam, said <HI>Lucy,</HI> that your
Ladyship would be pleas'd to let him speak with
you.</P>
<P>Or, in his Words, I suppose, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI>
he humbly implor'd a Moment's Audience.</P>
<P>I told your Ladyship his very Words, indeed,
Madam, said <HI>Lucy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="195"/>
I tell thee, Girl, thou art mistaken, said
<HI>Arabella;</HI> 'tis impossible he should sue for such
a Favour in Terms like those: Therefore, go
back, and let him know that I consent to grant
him a short Audience upon these Conditions.</P>
<P>First, Provided he does not abuse my Indul∣gence
by offending me with any Protestations
of his Passion.</P>
<P>Secondly, That he engages to fulfil the In∣junctions
I shall lay upon him, however cruel
and terrible they may appear.</P>
<P>Lastly, That his Despair must not prompt
him to any Act of Desperation against himself.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy</HI> having received this Message, quitted
the Room hastily, for fear she should forget it.</P>
<P>Well, my pretty Ambassadress, said <HI>Tinsel</HI>
when he saw her enter the Anti-Chamber,
Will your Lady see me?</P>
<P>No, Sir, replied <HI>Lucy.</HI></P>
<P>No, interrupted <HI>Tinsel,</HI> that's kind 'faith,
after waiting so long.</P>
<P>Pray Sir, said <HI>Lucy,</HI> don't put me out so; I
shall forget what my Lady order'd me to tell
you.</P>
<P>Oh! I ask your Pardon, Child, said <HI>Tinsel.</HI>
Come, let me hear your Message.</P>
<P>Sir, said <HI>Lucy</HI> adapting the Solemnity of her
Lady's Accent—My Lady bad me say, that she
will grant—No, that she consents to grant you
a short Dience.</P>
<P>Audience you would say Child, said <HI>Tinsel.</HI>
But how came you to tell me before she would
not see me?—</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="196"/>
I vow and protest, Sir, said <HI>Lucy,</HI> you have
put all my Lady's Words clean out of my
Head—I don't know what comes next—</P>
<P>Oh, no matter, said <HI>Tinsel,</HI> you have told
me enough: I'll wait upon her directly.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy,</HI> who saw him making towards the
Door, prest between it and him; and having
all her Lady's Whims in her Head, suppos'd
he was going to carry her away—Possess'd with
this Thought, she scream'd out, Help! Help!
for Heaven's Sake! My Lady willl be carry'd
away!</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> hearing this Exclamation of her
Woman's, eccho'd her Screams, tho' with a
Voice infinitely more delicate; and seeing <HI>Tinsel,</HI>
who, confounded to the last Degree at the
Cries of both the Lady and her Woman, had
got into her Chamber he knew not how,
she gave herself over for lost, and fell back in
her Chair in a Swoon, or something she took
for a Swoon, for she was persuaded it could
happen no otherwise; since all Ladies in the
same Circumstances arr terrify'd into a fainting
Fit, and seldom recover till they are conveni∣ently
carried away; and when they awake, find
themselves many Miles off in the Power of
their Ravisher.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI>'s other Women, alarm'd by her
Cries, came running into the Room; and see∣ing
Mr. <HI>Tinsel</HI> there, and their Lady ia a Swoon,
concluded some very extraordinary Accident
had happen'd.</P>
<P>What is your Business here, cry'd they all at
a Time? Is it you that has frighted her Lady∣ship?</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="197"/>
Devil take me, said <HI>Tinsel</HI> amaz'd, if I can
tell what all this means.</P>
<P>By this Time Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> and
his Sister, came running astonish'd up Stairs.
<HI>Arabella</HI> still continu'd motionless in her Chair,
her Eyes clos'd, and her Head reclin'd upon
<HI>Lucy,</HI> who with her other Women, was en∣deavouring
to recover her.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> eagerly ran to her Assistance,
while Sir <HI>Charles</HI> and his Daughter as eagerly
interrogated Mr. <HI>Tinsel,</HI> who stood motionless
with Surprize, concerning the Cause of her
Disorder.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> then first discovering some Signs
of Life, half open'd her Eyes.</P>
<P>Inhuman Wretch, cry'd she, with a faint
Voice, supposing herself in the Hands of her
Ravisher, think not thy cruel Violence shall
procure thee what thy Submissions could not
obtain; and if when thou hadst only my In∣difference
to surmount, thou didst find it so dif∣ficult
to overcome my Resolution, now that by
this unjust Attempt, thou hast added Aversion
to that Indifference, never hope for any Thing
but the most bitter Reproaches from me.—</P>
<P>Why, Niece, said Sir <HI>Charles</HI> approaching
her, what's the Matter? Look up, I beseech
you, no-body is attempting to do you any Hurt;
here's none but Friends about you.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> raising her Head at the Sound of
her Uncle's Voice, and casting a confus'd Look
on the Persons about her,</P>
<P>May I believe my Senses? Am I rescu'd,
and in my own Chamber? To whose Va∣lour
is my Deliverance owing? Without
<PB N="196" REF="198"/>
doubt, 'tis to my Cousin's; but where is he?
Let me assure him of my Gratitude.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who had retir'd to a Window
in great Confusion, as soon as he heard her call
for him, came towards her, and in a Whisper
begg'd her to be compos'd; that she was in no
Danger.</P>
<P>And pray, Niece, said Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> now you
are a little recover'd, be so good to inform us
of the Cause of your Fright. What has hap∣pen'd
to occasion all this Confusion?</P>
<P>How, Sir, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> don't you know
then what has happen'd?—Pray how was I
brought again into my Chamber, and by what
Means was I rescu'd?</P>
<P>I protest, said Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> I don't know that
you have been out of it.</P>
<P>Alas, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> I perceive you are
quite ignorant of what has befallen me; nor
am I able to give you any Information: All I
can tell you is, that alarm'd by my Womens
Cries, and the Sight of my Ravisher, who
came into my Chamber, I fainted away, and
so faciliated his Enterprize; since doubtless it
was very easy for him to carry me away while
I remain'd in that senseless Condition. How I
was rescu'd, or by whom, one of my Women
can haply inform you; since its probable one of
them was also forc'd away with me—Oh
Heav'ns! cry'd she, seeing <HI>Tinsel,</HI> who all this
while stood gazing like one distracted; what
makes that impious Man in my Presence!
What am I to think of this? Am I really de∣liver'd
or no?</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="199"/>
What can this mean, cried Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> turn∣ing
to <HI>Tinsel?</HI> Have you, Sir, had any Hand
in frighting my Niece?—</P>
<P>I, Sir, said <HI>Tinsel!</HI> Let me perish if ever I
was so confounded in my Life: The Lady's
Brain is disorder'd I believe.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who was convinc'd all this
Confusion was caus'd by some of <HI>Arabella</HI>'s
usual Whims, dreaded lest an Explanation would
the more expose her; and therefore told his
Father, that it would be best to retire, and leave
his Cousin to the Care of his Sister and her Wo∣men;
adding, that she was not yet quite reco∣ver'd,
and their Presence did but discompose
her.</P>
<P>Then addressing himself to <HI>Tinsel,</HI> told him
he would wait upon him down Stairs.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> seeing them going away together,
and supposing they intended to dispute the Pos∣session
of her with their Swords, call'd out to
them to stay.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> however, without minding her,
press'd Mr. <HI>Tinsel</HI> to walk down.</P>
<P>Nay, pray, Sir, said the Beau, let us go in
again; she may grow outrageous if we disoblige
her.</P>
<P>Outrageous, Sir, said <HI>Glanville,</HI> do you sup∣pose
my Cousin is mad?</P>
<P>Upon my Soul, Sir, replied <HI>Tinsel,</HI> if she is
not mad, she is certainly a little out of her
Senses, or so—</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> having reiterated her Commands for
her Lovers to return, and finding they did not
obey her, ran to her Chamber-door, where they
were holding a surly Sort of Conference, espe∣cially
<PB N="198" REF="200"/>
on <HI>Glanville</HI>'s Side, who was horridly out
of Humour.</P>
<P>I perceive by your Looks. said <HI>Arabella</HI> to
her Cousin, the Design you are meditating;
but know that I absolutely forbid you, by all
the Power I have over you, not to engage in
Combat with my Ravisher here.</P>
<P>Madam, interrupted <HI>Glanville,</HI> I beseech you
do not—</P>
<P>I know, said she, you will object to me the
Examples of <HI>Artamenes, Aronces,</HI> and many
others, who were so generous as to promise
their Rivals not to refuse them that Satisfaction
whenever they demanded it—but consider, you
have not the same Obligations to Mr. <HI>Tinsel</HI> that
<HI>Artamenes</HI> had to the King of <HI>Assyria,</HI> or that
<HI>Arances</HI> had to—</P>
<P>For God's Sake, Cousin, said <HI>Glanville,</HI> what's
all this to the Purpose? Curse on <HI>Aronces</HI> and
the King of <HI>Assyria,</HI> I say—</P>
<P>The Astonishment of <HI>Arabella</HI> at this intem∣perate
Speech of her Cousin, kept her for a Mo∣ment
immoveable, when Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> who du∣ring
this Discourse, had been collecting all the
Information he could from <HI>Lucy,</HI> concerning
this perplex'd Affair, came towards <HI>Tinsel,</HI> and
giving him an angry Look, told him, He should
take it well if he forbore visiting any of his Fa∣mily
for the future.</P>
<P>Oh! Your most obedient Servant, Sir, said
<HI>Tinsel:</HI> You expect, I suppose, I should be ex∣cessively
chagrin'd at this Prohibition? But up∣on
my Soul, I am greatly oblig'd to you. Agad!
I have no great Mind to a Halter: And since
this Lady is so apt to think People have a Design
<PB N="199" REF="201"/>
to ravish her, the wisest Thing a Man can do,
is to keep out of her Way.</P>
<P>Sir, replied <HI>Glanville,</HI> who had follow'd him
to the Door, I believe there was been some little
Mistake in what has happen'd To-day—How∣ever,
I expect you'll take no unbecoming Li∣berties
with the Character of Lady <HI>Bella</HI>—</P>
<P>Oh! Sir, said <HI>Tinsel,</HI> I give you my Honour
I shall always speak of the Lady with the most
profound Veneration. She is a most accom∣plish'd,
incomprehensible Lady: And the De∣vil
take me, if I think there is her Fellow in
the World—And so, Sir, I am your most
obedient—</P>
<P>A Word with you before you go, said
<HI>Glanville</HI> stopping him—No more of these Sneers
as you value that smooth Face of yours, or I'll
despoil it of a Nose.</P>
<P>Oh! Your humble Servant, said the Beau,
retiring in great Confusion, with something be∣twixt
a Smile and a Grin upon his Countenance,
which he took Care however Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>
should not see; who as soon as he quitted him
went again to <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Apartment, in order to
prevail upon his Father and Sister to leave her
a little to herself, for he dreaded lest some more
Instances of her Extravagance would put it in∣to
his Father's Head, that she was really out of
her Senses.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, said <HI>Arabella</HI> upon his Entrance,
you have I suppose, given your Rival his Li∣berty.
I assure you this Generosity is highly
agreeable to me—And herein you imitate the
noble <HI>Artamenes,</HI> who upon a like Occasion,
acted as you have done. For when Fortune
<PB N="200" REF="202"/>
had put the Ravisher of <HI>Mandana</HI> in his Power,
and he became the Vanquisher of his Rival,
who endeavour'd by Violence to possess that di∣vine
Princess; this truly generous Hero relin∣quish'd
the Right he had of disposing of his Pri∣soner,
and instead of sacrificing his Life to his
just and reasonable Vengeance, he gave a Proof
of his admirable Virtue and Clemency by dis∣missing
him in Safety, as you have done. How∣ever,
added she, I hope you have made him
swear upon your Sword, that he will never
make a second Attempt upon my Liberty. I
perceive, pursued she, seeing Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> con∣tinued
silent, with his Eyes bent on the
Ground, for indeed he was asham'd to look up;
that you would willingly avoid the Praise due
to the heroick Action you have just perform'd—
Nay, I suppose you are resolv'd to keep it secret
if possible; yet I must tell you, that you will
not escape the Glory due to it. Glory is as
necessarily the Result of a virtuous Action, as
Light is an Effect of the Sun which causeth it,
and has no Dependence on any other Cause;
since a virtuous Action continues still the same,
tho' it be done without Testimony; and Glory,
which is, as one may say born with it, con∣stantly
attends it, tho' the Action be not known.</P>
<P>I protest Niece, said Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> that's very
prettily said.</P>
<P>In my Opinion, Sir, pursued <HI>Arabella,</HI> if
any thing can weaken the Glory of a good
Action, its the Care a Person takes to make it
known: As if one did not do Good for the
Sake of Good, but for the Praise that generally
follows it. Those then that are govern'd by
<PB N="201" REF="203"/>
so interested a Motive, ought to be consider'd
as sordid rather than generous Persons; who
making a Kind of Traffick between Virtue and
Glory, barter just so much of the one for the
other and expect like other Merchants, to
make Advantage by the Exchange.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who was charm'd into an Ex∣tacy
at this sensible Speech of <HI>Arabella</HI>'s, forgot
in an Instant all her Absurdities. He did not
fail to express his Admiration of her Under∣standing
in Terms that brought a Blush into
her fair Face, and oblig'd her to lay her Com∣mands
upon him to cease his excessive Com∣mendations.
Then making a Sign to them to
leave her alone, Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> who understood
her, took his Father and Sister down Stairs,
leaving <HI>Arabella</HI> with her faithful <HI>Lucy,</HI> whom
she immediately commanded to give her a Re∣lation
of what had happen'd to her from the
Time of her swooning till she recover'd.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="14" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XIV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A Dialogue between Arabella and Lucy,
in which the latter seems to have the
Advantage.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHY, Madam, said <HI>Lucy,</HI> all I can tell
your Ladyship is, that we were all ex∣cessively
frighted, to be sure, when you faint∣ed,
especially myself; and that we did what
we could to recover you—And so accordingly
your Ladyship did recover.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="204"/>
What's this to the Purpose, said <HI>Arabella,</HI>
perceiving she stop'd here? I know that I faint∣ed,
and 'tis also very plain that I recover'd
again—I ask you what happen'd to me in the
intermediate Time between my Fainting and
Recovery. Give me a faithful Relation of all
the Accidents, to which by my Fainting I am
quite a Stranger; and which no doubt, are very
considerable—</P>
<P>Indeed, Madam, replied <HI>Lucy,</HI> I have given
your Ladyship a faithful Relation of all I can
remember.</P>
<P>When, resum'd <HI>Arabella</HI> surpiz'd?—</P>
<P>This Moment, Madam, said <HI>Lucy.</HI></P>
<P>Why, sure thou dream'st Wench, replied
she, Hast thou told me how I was seiz'd and
carry'd off? How I was rescu'd again? And—</P>
<P>No, indeed, Madam, interrupted <HI>Lucy,</HI> I
don't dream; I never told your Ladyship that
you was carry'd off.</P>
<P>Well, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> and why dost thou not
satisfy my Curiosity? Is it not fit I should be
acquainted with such a momentous Part of my
History?</P>
<P>I can't indeed, and please your Ladyship,
said <HI>Lucy.</HI></P>
<P>What, can'st thou not, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> en∣rag'd
at her Stupidity, as she thought it.</P>
<P>Why, Madam, said <HI>Lucy</HI> sobbing, I can't
make a History of nothing.</P>
<P>Of nothing, Wench, resum'd <HI>Arabella,</HI> in
a greater Rage than before: Dost thou call an
Adventure to which thou was a Witness, and
borest haply so great a Share in, nothing?—An
Adventure which hereafter will make a consi∣derable
<PB N="203" REF="205"/>
Figure in the Relation of my Life, dost
thou look upon as trisling and of no Conse∣quence?</P>
<P>No, indeed I don't, Madam, said <HI>Lucy.</HI></P>
<P>Why then, pursued <HI>Arabella,</HI> dost thou wil∣fully
neglect to relate it? Suppose, as there is
nothing more likely, thou wert commanded by
some Persons of considerable Quality, or haply
some great Princes and Princesses, to recount
the Adventures of my Life, would'st thou omit
a Circumstance of so much Moment?</P>
<P>No indeed, Madam, said <HI>Lucy.</HI></P>
<P>I am glad to hear thou art so discreet, said
<HI>Arabella;</HI> and pray do me the Favour to relate
this Adventure to me, as thou would'st do to
those Princes and Princesses, if thou wert com∣manded.</P>
<P>Here, <HI>Arabella</HI> making a full Stop, fix'd her
Eyes upon her Woman, expecting every Mo∣ment
she would begin the desir'd Narrative—
But finding she continu'd silent longer than she
thought was necessary for recalling the several
Circumstances of the Story into her Mind,</P>
<P>I find, said she, it will be necessary to cau∣tion
you against making your Audience wait too
long for your Relation; it looks as if you was
to make a studied Speech, not a simple Relation
of Facts, which ought to be free from all Af∣fectation
of Labour and Art; and be told with
that graceful Negligence which is so becoming
to Truth.</P>
<P>This I thought proper to tell you, added she,
that you may not fall into that Mistake when you
are called upon to relate my Adventures—
Well, now if you please to begin—,</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="206"/>
What, pray, Madam, said <HI>Lucy?</HI></P>
<P>What, repeated <HI>Arabella?</HI> Why, the Ad∣ventures
which happen'd to me so lately. Re∣late
to me every Circumstance of my being
carried away, and how my Deliverance was ef∣fected
by my Cousin.</P>
<P>Indeed, Madam, said <HI>Lucy,</HI> I know nothing
about your Ladyship's being carried away. All
I know is—</P>
<P>Begone, cried <HI>Arabella</HI> losing all Patience at
her Obstinacy, get out of my Presence this
Moment. Wretch, unworthy of my Confi∣dence
and Favour, thy Treason is too manifest,
thou art brib'd by that presumptuous Man to
conceal all the Circumstances of his Attempt
from my Knowleddge, to the End that I may
not have a full Conviction of his Guilt.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy,</HI> who never saw her Lady so much of∣fended
before, and knew not the Occasion of
it, burst into Tears; which so affected the
tender Heart of <HI>Arabella,</HI> that losing insensibly
all her Anger, she told her with a Voice soft∣en'd
to a Tone of the utmost Sweetness and
Condescension, that provided she would con∣fess
how far she had been prevail'd upon by his
rich Presents, to forget her Duty, she would
pardon and receive her again into Favour—</P>
<P>Speak, added she, and be not afraid after this
Promise, to let me know what Mr. <HI>Tinsel</HI> re∣quir'd
of thee, and what were the Gifts with
which he purchas'd thy Services: doubtless, he
presented thee with Jewels of a considerable
Value—</P>
<P>Since your Ladyship, said <HI>Lucy</HI> sobbing, has
promis'd not to be angry, I don't care if I do
<PB N="205" REF="207"/>
tell your Ladyship what he gave me. He gave
me this half Guinea, Madam, indeed he did;
but for all that, when he would come into
your Chamber I struggled with him, and cry'd
out, for fear he should carry your Ladyship
away—</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> lost in Astonishment and Shame at
hearing of so inconsiderable a Present made to
her Woman, the like of which not one of her
Romances could furnish her, order'd her im∣mediately
to withdraw, not being willing she
should observe the Confusion this strange Bribe
had given her.</P>
<P>After she had been gone some Time, she en∣deavour'd
to compose her Looks, and went
down to the Dining-Room, where Sir <HI>Charles</HI>
and his Son and Daughter had been engag'd in
a Conversation concerning her, the Particulars
of which may be found in the first Chapter of
the next Book.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>ISS <HI>Glanville,</HI> who with a mali∣cious
Pleasure had secretly tri∣umph'd
in the Extravagances her
beautiful Cousin had been guilty
of, was now sensibly disappointed
to find they had had so little Effect on her Father
and Brother; for instead of reflecting upon the
Absurdities to which they had been a Witness,
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> artfully pursu'd the Subject <HI>Arabella</HI>
just before had been expatiating upon, taking no∣tice
frequently of some Observations of hers, and
<PB N="207" REF="209"/>
by a well contriv'd Repetition of her Words,
oblig'd his Father a second Time to declare that
his Niece had spoken extremely well.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> taking the Word, launch'd out
into such Praises of her Wit, that Miss <HI>Glan∣ville,</HI>
no longer able to listen patiently, reply'd,</P>
<P>'Twas true Lady <HI>Bella</HI> sometimes said very
sensible Things; that 'twas a great Pity she was
not always in a reasonable Way of thinking,
or that her Intervals were not longer—</P>
<P>Her Intervals, Miss, said <HI>Glanville,</HI> pray
what do you mean by that Expression?—</P>
<P>Why, pray, said Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> don't you
think my Cousin is sometimes a little wrong in
the Head?</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> at these Words starting from
his Chair, took a Turn a-cross the Room in
great Discomposure, then stopping all of a sud∣den,
and giving his Sister a furious Look—
<HI>Charlotte,</HI> said he, don't give me Cause to think
you are envious of your Cousin's superior Ex∣cellencies—</P>
<P>Envious, repeated Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> I envious
of my Cousin—I vow I sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uld never have
thought of that—Indeed, Brother, you are
much mistaken; my Cousin's superior Excel∣lencies
never gave me a Moment's Disturbance—
Tho' I must confess her unaccountable Whims
have often excited my Pity—</P>
<P>No more of this, <HI>Charlotte,</HI> interrupted
Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> as you value my Friendship—
No more of it—</P>
<P>Why, really Son, said Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> my Niece
has very strange Whimsies sometimes. How
it came into her Head to think Mr. <HI>Tinsel</HI> would
<PB N="208" REF="210"/>
attempt to carry her away, I can't imagine?
For after all, he only prest rather too rudely
into her Chamber, for which, as you see, I
have ferbidden his Visits.</P>
<P>That was of a Piece, said Miss <HI>Glanville</HI>
sneeringly to her Brother, with her asking you
if you had made Mr. <HI>Tinsel</HI> swear upon your
Sword, that he would never again attempt to
carry her away; and applauding you for having
given him his Liberty, as the generous <HI>Atermens</HI>
did on the same Occasion.</P>
<P>I would advise you, <HI>Charlotte,</HI> said Mr. <HI>Glan∣ville,</HI>
not to aim at repeating your Cousins's
Words, till you know how to pronounce them
properly.</P>
<P>Oh! that's one of her superior Excellencies,
said Miss <HI>Glanville.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed, Miss, said <HI>Glanville</HI> very provokingly,
she is superior to you in many Things; and as
much so in the Goodness of her Heart, as in
the Beauty of her Person—</P>
<P>Come, come, <HI>Charles,</HI> said the Baronet,
who observ'd his Daughter sat swelling and bi∣ting
her Lip at this Reproach, personal Reflecti∣ons
are better avoided. Your Sister is very well,
and not to be disparag'd; tho' to be sure, Lady
<HI>Bella</HI> is the finest Woman I ever saw in my
Life.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> was, if possible, more disgusted
at her Father's Palliation than her Brother's Re∣proaches;
and in order to give a Loose to her
Passion, accus'd Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> of a Decrease in
his Affection for her, since he had been in Love
with her Cousin; and having found this Excuse
for her Tears, very freely gave vent to them—</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="211"/>
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> being softned by this Sight, sa∣crificed
a few Compliments to her Vanity,
which soon restor'd her to her usual Tranquillity;
then turning the Discourse on his beloved <HI>Ara∣bella,</HI>
pronounc'd a Panegyrick on her Virtues
and Accomplishments of an Hour long; which,
if it did not absolutely persuade his Sister to
change her Opinion, it certainly convinc'd his
Father, that his Niece was not only perfectly
well in her Understanding, but even better than
most others of her Sex.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> had just finish'd her Eulogium,
when <HI>Arabella</HI> appear'd; Joy danc'd in his
Eyes at her Approach; he gaz'd upon her with
a Kind of conscious Triumph in his Looks;
her consummate Loveliness justifying his Pas∣sion,
and being in his Opinion, more than an
Excuse for all her Extravagancies.</P>

<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which our Heroine, as we presume,
shews herself in two very different
Lights.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>ARABELLA,</HI> who at her Entrance had
perceiv'd some Traces of Uneasiness upon
Miss <HI>Glanville</HI>'s Countenance, tenderly ask'd her
the Cause; to which that young Lady answer∣ing
in a cold and reserv'd Manner, Mr. <HI>Glan∣ville,</HI>
to divert her Reflexions on it, very freely
accus'd himself of having given his Sister some
Offence. To be sure, Brother, said Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI>
<PB N="210" REF="212"/>
you are very vehement in your Temper, and
are as violently carry'd away about Things of
little Importance as of the greatest; and then,
whatever you have a Fancy for, you love so
obstinately.</P>
<P>I am oblig'd to you, Miss, interrupted
Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> for endeavouring to give Lady
<HI>Bella</HI> so unfavourable an Opinion of me—</P>
<P>I assure you, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> has
said nothing to your Disadvantage: For, in my
Opinion, the Temperament of great Minds
ought to be such as she represents yours to be.
For there is nothing at so great a Distance from
true and heroick Virtue, as that Indifference
which obliges some People to be pleas'd with all
Things or nothing: Whence it comes to pass,
that they neither entertain great Desires of Glo∣ry,
nor Fear of Infamy; that they neither love
nor hate; that they are wholly influenc'd by
Custom, and are sensible only of the Afflictions
of the Body, their Minds being in a Manner
insensible—</P>
<P>To say the Truth, I am inclin'd to conceive
a greater Hope of a Man, who in the Begin∣ning
of his Life is hurry'd away by some evil
Habit, than one that fastens on nothing: The
Mind that cannot be brought to detest Vice,
will never be persuaded to love Virtue; but one
who is capable of loving or hating irreconcile∣bly,
by having, when young, his Passions di∣rected
to proper Objects, will remain fix'd in
his Choice of what is good. But with him who
is incapable of any violent Attraction, and
whose Heart is chilled by a general Indiffer∣ence,
Precept or Example will have no Force—
<PB N="211" REF="213"/>
And Philosophy itself, which boasts it hath Re∣medies
for all Indispositions of the Soul, never
had any that can cure an indifferent Mind—
Nay, added she, I am persuaded that Indiffe∣rence
is generally the inseparable Companion of
a weak and imperfect Judgment. For it is so
natural to a Person to be carry'd towards that
which he believes to be good, that if indifferent
People were able to judge of Things, they would
fasten on something. But certain it is that this
luke-warmness of Soul, which sends sorth but
seeble Desires, sends also but feeble Lights; so
that those who are guilty of it, not knowing
any thing clearly, cannot fasten on any thing
with Perseverance.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> when <HI>Arabella</HI> had finish'd
this Speech, cast a triumphing Glance at his
Sister, who had affected great In-attention all
the while she had been speaking. Sir <HI>Charles</HI>
in his Way, express'd much Admiration of her
Wit, telling her, if she had been a Man, she
would have made a great Figure in Parliament,
and that her Speeches might have come perhaps
to be printed in time.</P>
<P>This Compliment, odd as it was, gave great
Joy to <HI>Glanville,</HI> when the Conversation was
interrupted by the Arrival of Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI> who
had slipt away unobserv'd at the Time that
<HI>Arabella</HI>'s Indisposition had alarm'd them, and
now came to enquire after her Health; and also
if an Opportunity offer'd to set her right with
Regard to the Suspicions she had entertain'd of
his designing to pay his Addresses to her.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> as soon as he had sent in his Name,
appear'd to be in great Disturbance; and upon
<PB N="212" REF="214"/>
his Entrance, offer'd immediately to withdraw,
telling Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who would have detain'd
her, that she found no Place was likely to se∣cure
her from the Persecutions of that Gen∣tleman.</P>
<P><HI>Glanville</HI> star'd, and look'd strangely per∣plex'd
at this Speech; Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> smil'd,
and poor <HI>Selvin,</HI> with a very silly Look—hem'd
two or three times, and then with a faultring
Accent said, Madam, I am very much con∣cern'd
to find your Ladyship resolv'd to per∣sist
in—</P>
<P>Sir, interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> my Resolutions
are unalterable. I told you so before, and am
surpriz'd, after the Knowledge of my Inten∣tions,
you presume to appear in my Presence
again, from whence I had so positively banish'd
you.</P>
<P>Pray, Niece, said Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> what has
Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> done to disoblige you?</P>
<P>Sir, reply'd <HI>Arabella,</HI> Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI>'s Offence
can admit of no other Reparation than that
which I requir'd of him, which was a volun∣tary
Banishment from my Presence: And in
this pursu'd she, I am guilty of no more Seve∣rity
to you, than the Princess <HI>Udosia</HI> was to the
unfortunate <HI>Thrasimedes.</HI> For the Passion of
this Prince having come to her Knowledge,
notwithstanding the Pains he took to conceal it,
this fair and wise Princess thought it not enough
to forbid his speaking to her, but also banish'd
him from her Presence; laying a peremptory
Command upon him, never to appear before
her again till he was perfectly cur'd of that un∣happy
Love he had entertain'd for her—Imitate
<PB N="213" REF="215"/>
therefore the meritorious Obedience of this poor
Prince, and if that Passion you profess for me—</P>
<P>How, Sir, interrupted Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> Do you
make Love to my Niece then?—</P>
<P>Sir, replied Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI> who was strangely
confounded at <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Speech, tho' I really
admire the Perfections this Lady is possess'd of,
yet I assure you, upon my Honour, I never had
a Thought of making any Addresses to her;
and I can't imagine why her Ladyship persists
in accusing me of such Presumption.</P>
<P>So formal a Denial after what <HI>Arabella</HI> had
said, extremely perplex'd Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> and fill'd
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> with inconceivable Shame—</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> enjoy'd their Disturbance, and
full of an ill-natur'd Triumph, endeavour'd to
look <HI>Arabella</HI> into Confusion: But that Lady
not being at all discompos'd by this Declaration
of Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI>'s, having accounted for it al∣ready,
replied with great Calmness,</P>
<P>Sir, 'Tis easy to see thro' the Artifice of your
disclaiming any Passion for me—Upon any other
Occasion questionless, you would rather sacri∣fice
your Life, than consent to disavow these
Sentiments, which unhappily for your Peace
you have entertain'd. At present the Desire of
continuing near me, obliges you to lay this
Constraint upon yourself; however you know
<HI>Thrasimedes</HI> fell upon the same Stratagem to no
Purpose. The rigid <HI>Udosia</HI> saw thro' the Dis∣guise,
and would not dispense with herself from
banishing him from <HI>Rome,</HI> as I do you from
<HI>England</HI>—</P>
<P>How, Madam! interrupted <HI>Selvin</HI> amaz'd—</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="216"/>
Yes, Sir, replied <HI>Arabella</HI> hastily, nothing
less can satisfy what I owe to the Consideration
of my own Glory.</P>
<P>Upon my Word, Madam, said <HI>Selvin,</HI> half
angry, and yet strongly inclin'd to laugh, I
don't see the Necessity of my quitting my na∣tive
Country, to satisfy what you owe to the
Consideration of your own Glory. Pray, how
does my staying in <HI>England</HI> affect your Lady∣ship's
Glory?</P>
<P>To answer your Question with another, said
<HI>Arabella,</HI> Pray how did the Stay of <HI>Thrasimedes</HI>
in <HI>Rome,</HI> affect the Glory of the Empress
<HI>Udosia?</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> was struck dumb with this Speech,
for he was not willing to be thought so deficient
in the Knowledge of History, as not to be ac∣quainted
with the Reasons why <HI>Thrasimedes</HI>
should not stay in <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>His Silence therefore seeming to <HI>Arabella</HI> to
be a tacit Confession of the Justice of her Com∣mands,
a Sentiment of Compassion for this un∣fortunate
Lover, intruded itself into her Mind;
and turning her bright Eyes, full of a soft Com∣placency
upon <HI>Selvin,</HI> who star'd at her as if he
had lost his Wits—</P>
<P>I will not, said she, wrong the Sublimity of
your Passion for me so much, as to doubt your
being ready to sacrifice the Repose of your own
Life to the Satisfaction of mine: Nor will I
do so much Injustice to your Generosity, as to
suppose the Glory of obeying my Commands,
will not in some Measure soften the Rigour of
your Destiny—I know not whether it may be
lawful for me to tell you, that your Misfortune
<PB N="215" REF="217"/>
does really cause me some Affliction; but I am
willing to give you this Consolation, and also
to assure you, that to whatever Part of the
World your Despair will carry you, the good
Wishes and Compassion of <HI>Arabella</HI> shall follow
you—</P>
<P>Having said this, with one of her fair Hands
she cover'd her Face, to hide the Blushes which
so compassionate a Speech had caus'd—Holding
the other extended with a careless Air, sup∣posing
he would kneel to kiss it, and bathe it
with his Tears, as was the Custom on such me∣lancholy
Occasions, her Head at the samè Time
turned another Way, as if reluctantly and
with Confusion she granted this Favour.—
But after standing a Moment in this Posture,
and finding her Hand untouch'd, she concluded
Grief had depriv'd him of his Senses, and that
he would shortly fall into a Swoon as <HI>Thrasime∣des</HI>
did: And to prevent being a Witness of so
doleful a Sight, she hurry'd out of the Room
without once turning about, and having reach'd
her own Apartment, sunk into a Chair, not a
little affected with the deplorable Condition in
which she had left her suppos'd miserable Lover.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Contrast continued.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Company she had left behind her be∣ing
all, except Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> to the last
Degree surpriz'd at her strange Words and
<PB N="216" REF="218"/>
Actions, continued mute for several Minutes
after she was gone, staring upon one another,
as if each wish'd to know the other's Opinion
of such an unaccountable Behaviour. At last
Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> who observed her Brother's Back
was towards her, told Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> in a low
Voice, that she hop'd he would call and take
his Leave of them before he set out for the
Place where his Despair would carry him.—</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> in spite of his natural Gravity,
could not forbear laughing at this Speech of
Miss <HI>Glanville</HI>'s, which shock'd her Brother,
and not being able to stay where <HI>Arabella</HI> was
ridicul'd, nor intitled to resent it, which would
have been a manifest Injustice on that Occasion,
he retir'd to his own Apartment to give vent to
that Spleen which in those Moments made him
out of Humour with all the World.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> when he was gone, indulg'd
himself in a little Mirth on his Niece's Extra∣vagance,
protesting he did not know what to do
with her. Upon which Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> observ'd,
that it was a Pity there were not such Things
as Protestant Nunneries; giving it as her Opi∣nion,
that her Cousin ought to be confin'd in
one of those Places, and never suffer'd to see
any Company, by which Means she would avoid
exposing herself in the Manner she did now.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI> who possibly thought this a rea∣sonable
Scheme of Miss <HI>Glanville</HI>'s, seem'd by
his Silence to assent to her Opinion; but Sir
<HI>Charles</HI> was greatly displeas'd with his Daughter
for expressing herself so freely; alledging that
<HI>Arabella,</HI> when she was out of those Whims,
was a very sensible young Lady, and sometimes.
<PB N="217" REF="219"/>
talk'd as learnedly as a Divine. To which
Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> also added, that she had a great
Knowledge of History, and had a most sur∣prizing
Memory; and after some more Dis∣course
to the same Purpose, he took his Leave,
earnestly entreating Sir <HI>Charles</HI> to believe that
he never entertain'd any Design of making his
Addresses to Lady <HI>Bella.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean Time, that Lady after having
given near half an Hour to those Reflexions
which occur to Heroines in the same Situation
with herself, called for <HI>Lucy,</HI> and order'd her
to go to the Dining-Room, and see in what
Condition Mr <HI>Selvin</HI> was, telling her she had
certainly left him in a Swoon, as also the Oc∣casion
of it; and bid her give him all the Con∣solation
in her Power.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy,</HI> with Tears in her Eyes at this Recital,
went down as she was order'd, and entering the
Room without any Ceremony, her Thoughts
being wholly fix'd on the melancholy Circum∣stance
her Lady had been telling her; she look'd
eagerly round the Room without speaking a
Word, till Sir <HI>Charles</HI> and Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> who
thought she had been sent with some Message
from <HI>Arabella,</HI> ask'd her both at the same In∣stant,
What she wanted?—</P>
<P>I came, Sir, said <HI>Lucy,</HI> repeating her Lady's
Words, to see in what Condition Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> is
in, and to give him all the Solation in my
Power.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> laughing heartily at this Speech,
ask'd her what she could do for Mr. <HI>Selvin?</HI>
To which she reply'd, she did not know; but
<PB N="218" REF="220"/>
her Lady had told her to give him all the Sola∣tion
in her Power.</P>
<P>Consolation thou would'st say, I suppose, said
Sir <HI>Charles.</HI></P>
<P>Yes, Sir, said <HI>Lucy</HI> curtesying. Well, Child,
added he, go up and tell your Lady, Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI>
does not need any Consolation.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy</HI> accordingly return'd with this Message,
and was met at the Chamber-Door by <HI>Arabella,</HI>
who hastily ask'd her if Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> was reco∣ver'd
from his Swoon: To which <HI>Lucy</HI> reply'd
that she did not know; but that Sir <HI>Charles</HI>
bid her tell her Ladyship, Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> did not
need any Consolation.</P>
<P>Oh Heavens! cry'd <HI>Arabella,</HI> throwing her∣self
into a Chair as pale as Death—He is dead,
he has fallen upon his Sword, and put an End
to his Life and Miseries at once—Oh! how un∣happy
am I, cry'd she, bursting into Tears, to
be the Cause of so cruel an Accident—Was
ever any Fate so terrible as mine—Was ever
Beauty so fatal—Was ever Rigour so unfortu∣nate—How
will the Quiet of my future Days
be disturbed by the sad Remembrance of a Man
whose Death was caused by my Disdain—But
why, resum'd she after a little Pause—Why do
I thus afflict myself for what has happen'd by an
unavoidable Necessity? Nor am I singular in
the Misfortune which has befallen me—Did not
the sad <HI>Perinthus</HI> die for the beautiful <HI>Panthea</HI>—
Did not the Rigour of <HI>Barsina</HI> bring the mise∣rable
<HI>Oxyatres</HI> to the Grave—And the Severity
of <HI>Statira</HI> make <HI>Oroondates</HI> fall upon his Sword
in her Presence, tho' happily he escap'd being
kill'd by it—Let us then not afflict ourselves
<PB N="219" REF="221"/>
unreasonably at this sad Accident—Let us la∣ment
as we ought the fatal Effects of our
Charms—But let us comfort ourselves with the
Thought that we have only acted conformable
to our Duty.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> having pronounc'd these last Words
with a solemn and lofty Accent, order'd <HI>Lucy,</HI>
who listen'd to her with Eyes drown'd in Tears,
to go down and ask if the Body was remov'd—
for added she, all my Constancy will not be
sufficient to support me against that pitiful
Sight.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy</HI> accordinly deliver'd her Message to
Sir <HI>Charles</HI> and Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> who were still
together, discoursing on the fantastical Turn of
<HI>Arabella,</HI> when the Knight, who could not
possibly comprehend what she meant by asking
if the Body was removed, bid her tell her Lady
he desired to speak with her.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> upon receiving this Summons, set
herself to consider what could be the Intent of
it. If Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> be dead, said she, what Good
can my Presence do among them? Surely it
cannot be to upbraid me with my Severity, that
my Uncle desires to see me—No, it would be
unjust to suppose it. Questionless my unhappy
Lover is still struggling with the Pangs of Death,
and for a Consolation in his last Moments, im∣plores
the Favour of resigning up his Life in my
Sight. Pausing a little at these Words, she rose
from her Seat with a Resolution to give the un∣happy
<HI>Selvin</HI> her Pardon before he dy'd. Meet∣ing
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> as he was returning from his
Chamber to the Dining-Room, she told him,
she hop'd the Charity she was going to discover
<PB N="220" REF="222"/>
towards his Rival, would not give him any
Uneasiness; and preventing his Reply by going
hastily into the Room, he follow'd her dreading
some new Extravagance, yet not able to prevent
it, endeavour'd to conceal his Confusion from her
Observation—<HI>Arabella</HI> after breathing a gentle
Sigh told told Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> that she was come to
grant Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> her Pardon for the Offence he
had been guilty of, that he might depart in
Peace.</P>
<P>Well, well, said Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> he is departed in
Peace without it.</P>
<P>How, Sir, interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> is he dead
then already? Alas! why had he not the Satis∣faction
of seeing me before he expir'd, that his
Sould might have departed in Peace! He would
have been assur'd not only of my Pardon, but
Pity also; and that Assurance would have made
him happy in his last Moments.</P>
<P>Why, Niece, interrupted Sir <HI>Charles</HI> staring,
you surprize me prodigiously: Are you in
earnest?</P>
<P>Questionless I am, Sir, said she, nor ought you
to be surpriz'd at the Concern I express for the
Fate of this unhappy Man, nor at the Pardon I
propos'd to have granted him; since herein I am
justified by the Example of many great and
virtuous Princesses, who have done as much,
nay, haply more than I intended to have done,
for Persons whose Offences were greater than
Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI>'s.</P>
<P>I am very sorry, Madam, said Sir <HI>Charles,</HI>
to hear you talk in this Manner: 'Tis really
enough to make one suspect you are—</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="223"/>
You do me great Injustice, Sir, interrupted
<HI>Arabella,</HI> if you suspect me to be guilty of any
unbecoming Weakness for this Man: If barely
expressing my Compassion for his Misfortunes
be esteem'd so great a Favour, what would you
have thought if I had supported his Head on my
Knees while he was dying, shed Tears over
him, and discover'd all the Tokens of a sincere
Affliction for him?—</P>
<P>Good God! said Sir <HI>Charles</HI> lifting up his
Eyes, Did any body ever hear of any thing like
this?</P>
<P>What, Sir, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> with as great an
Appearance of Surprize in her Countenance as
his had discover'd, Do you say you never heard
of any thing like this? Then you never heard
of the Princess of <HI>Media,</HI> I suppose—</P>
<P>No, not I, Madam, said Sir <HI>Charles</HI> peevishly.</P>
<P>Then, Sir, resum'd <HI>Arabella,</HI> permit me to
tell you, that this fair and virtuous Princess
condescended to do all I have mention'd for the
fierce <HI>Labynet,</HI> Prince of <HI>Assyria;</HI> who tho' he
had mortally offended her by stealing her away
out of the Court of the King her Father, ne∣vertheless,
when he was wounded to Death in
her Presence, and humbly implor'd her Pardon
before he died, she condescended as I have said,
to support him on her Knees, and shed Tears
for his Disaster—I could produce many more
Instances of the like Compassion in Ladies al∣most
as highly born as herself, tho' perhaps their
Quality was not quite so illustrious, she being
the Heiress of two powerful Kingdoms. Yet
to mention only these—</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="224"/>
Good Heav'ns! cry'd Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> here,
being quite out of Patience, I shall go di∣stracted—</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> surpriz'd at this Exclamation, look'd
earnestly at him for a Moment—and then ask'd
him, Whether any thing she had said had given
him Uneasiness?</P>
<P>Yes, upon my Soul, Madam, said <HI>Glanville</HI>
so vex'd and confus'd that he hardly knew what
he said—</P>
<P>I am sorry for it, reply'd <HI>Arabella</HI> gravely,
and also am greatly concern'd to find that in
Generosity you are so much exceeded by the il∣lustrious
<HI>Cyrus;</HI> who was so far from taking
Umbrage at <HI>Mandana</HI>'s Behaviour to the dying
Prince, that he commended her for the Com∣passion
she had shewn him. So also did the
brave and generous <HI>Oroondates,</HI> when the fair
<HI>Statira</HI>—</P>
<P>By Heav'ns! cry'd <HI>Glanville</HI> rising in a Pas∣sion,
there's no hearing this. Pardon me,
Madam, but upon my Soul, you'll make me
hang myself.</P>
<P>Hang yourself, repeated <HI>Arabella,</HI> sure you
know not what you say?—You meant, I sup∣pose,
that you'll fall upon your Sword. What
Hero ever threatned to give himself so vulgar
a Death? But pray let me know the Cause of
your Despair, so sudden and so violent.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> continuing in a sort of sullen
Silence, <HI>Arabella</HI> raising her Voice went on:</P>
<P>Tho' I do not conceive myself oblig'd to give
you an Account of my Conduct, seeing that I
have only permitted you yet to hope for my
Favour; yet I owe to myself and my own
<PB N="223" REF="225"/>
Honour the Justification I am going to make.
Know then, that however suspicious my Com∣passion
for Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> may appear to your mi∣staken
Judgment, yet it has its Foundation
only in the Generosity of my Disposition, which
inclines me to pardon the Fault when the un∣happy
Criminal repents; and to afford him my
Pity when his Circumstances require it. Let
not therefore the Charity I have discover'd to∣wards
your Rival, be the Cause of your De∣spair,
since my Sentiments for him were he
living, would be what they were before; that
is, full of Indifference, nay, haply Disdain.
And suffer not yourself to be so carried away
by a violent and unjust Jealousy, as to threaten
your won Death, which if you really had any
Ground for your Suspicions, and truly lov'd me,
would come unsought for, tho' not undesir'd—
For indeed, was your Despair reasonable, Death
would necessarily follow it; for what Lover can
live under so desperate a Misfortune. In that
Case you may meet Death undauntedly when it
comes, nay, embrace it with Joy; but truly
the killing one's self is but a false Picture of true
Courage, proceeding rather from Fear of a fur∣ther
Evil, than Contempt of that you fly to:
For if it were a Contempt of Pain, the same
Principle would make you resolve to bear pa∣tiently
and fearlesly all kind of Pains; and
Hope being of all other the most contrary Thing
to Fear, this being an utter Banishment of Hope,
seems to have its Ground in Fear.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which Mr. Glanville makes an unsuc∣cessful
Attempt upon Arabella.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>ARABELLA,</HI> when she had finish'd these
Words, which banish'd in part Mr. <HI>Glan∣ville</HI>'s
Confusion, went to her own Apartment,
follow'd by Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> to whom she had
made a Sign for that Purpose; and throwing
herself into a Chair, burst into Tears, which
greatly surprizing Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> she prest her
to tell her the Cause.</P>
<P>Alas! reply'd <HI>Arabella,</HI> have I not Cause to
think myself extremely unhappy? The deplo∣rable
Death of Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI> the Despair to which
I see your Brother reduc'd, with the fatal Con∣sequences
which may attend it, fills me with a
mortal Uneasiness.</P>
<P>Well, said Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> your Ladyship
may make yourself quite easy as to both these
Matters; for Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> is not dead, nor is my
Brother in Despair that I know of.</P>
<P>What do you say, Miss, interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI>
is not Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> dead? Was the Wound he
gave himself not mortal then?</P>
<P>I know of no Wound that he gave himself,
not I, said Miss <HI>Glanville;</HI> what makes your
Ladyship suppose he gave himself a Wound▪
Lord bless me, what strange Thoughts come
into your Head.</P>
<P>Truly I am rejoic'd to hear it, reply'd <HI>Ara∣bella;</HI>
and in order to prevent the Effects of his
Despair, I'll instantly dispatch my Commands
to him to live.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="227"/>
I dare answer for his Obedience, Madam,
said Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> smiling.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> then gave Orders for Paper and Pens
to be brought her, and seeing Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> en∣ter
the Room, very formally acquainted him
with her Intention, telling him, that he ought
to be satisfy'd with the Banishment to which
she had doom'd his unhappy Rival, and not re∣quire
his Death, since he and nothing to fear
from his Pretensions.</P>
<P>I assure you, Madam, said Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> I
am perfectly easy upon that Account: And in
order to spare you the Trouble of sending to
Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI> I may venture to assure you that he
is in no Danger of dying.</P>
<P>'Tis impossible, Sir, reply'd <HI>Arabella,</HI> ac∣cording
to the Nature of Things, 'tis impossi∣ble
but he must already be very near Death—
You know the Rigour of my Sentence, you
know—</P>
<P>I know, Madam, said Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> that
Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> does not think himself under a Ne∣cessity
of obeying your Sentence; and has the
Impudence to question your Authority for ba∣nishing
him from his native Country.</P>
<P>My Authority, Sir, said <HI>Arabella</HI> strangely
surpriz'd, is founded upon the absolute Power
he has given me over him.</P>
<P>He denies that, Madam, said <HI>Glanville,</HI> and
says that he neither can give, nor you exercise
an absolute Power over him; since you are
both accountable to the King, whose Subjects
you are, and both restrain'd by the Laws un∣der
whose Sanction you live.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="228"/>
<HI>Arabella</HI>'s apparent Confusion at these Words
giving Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> Hopes that he had fallen
upon a proper Method to cure her of some of
her strange Notions, he was going to pursue his
Arguments, when <HI>Arabella</HI> looking a little
sternly upon him,</P>
<P>The Empire of Love, said she, like the Em∣pire
of Honour, is govern'd by Laws of its
own, which have no Dependence upon, or Re∣lation
to any other.</P>
<P>Pardon me, Madam, said <HI>Glanville,</HI> if I pre∣sume
to differ from you. Our Laws have fix'd
the Boundaries of Honour as well as those of
Love.</P>
<P>How is that possible, reply'd <HI>Arabella,</HI> when
they differ so widely, that a Man may be justi∣fy'd
by the one, and yet condemn'd by the
other? For Instance, pursued she, you are not
permitted by the Laws of the Land to take
away the Life of any Person whatever; yet the
Laws of Honour oblige you to hunt your Ene∣my
thro' the World, in order to sacrifice him
to your Vengeance. Since it is impossible then
for the same Actions to be at once just and un∣just,
it must necessarily follow, that the Law
which condemns it, and that which justifies it
is not the same, but directly opposite—And
now, added she, after a little Pause, I hope I
have entirely clear'd up that Point to you.</P>
<P>You have indeed, Madam, reply'd Mr. <HI>Glan∣ville,</HI>
proved to a Demonstration, that what
is called Honour is something distinct from Ju∣stice,
since they command Things absolutely
opposite to each other.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="229"/>
<HI>Arabella</HI> without reflecting on this Inference,
went on to prove the independent Sovereignty
of Love, which, said she, may be collected
from all the Words and Actions of those Heroes
who were inspir'd by this Passion. We see it
in them, pursued she, triumphing not only over
all natural and avow'd Allegiance, but superior
even to Friendship, Duty, and Honour itself.
This the Actions of <HI>Oroondates, Artaxerxes,
Spitridates,</HI> and many other illustrious Princes
sufficiently testify.</P>
<P>Love requires a more unlimited Obedience
from its Slaves, than any other Monarch can
expect from his Subjects; an Obedience which
is circumscrib'd by no Laws whatever, and de∣pendent
upon nothing but itself.</P>
<P>I shall live, Madam, says the renowned
Prince of <HI>Scythia</HI> to the divine <HI>Statira,</HI> I shall
live, since it is your Command I should do so;
and Death can have no Power over a Life which
you are pleas'd to take Care of—</P>
<P>Say only that you wish I should conquer,
said the great <HI>Juba</HI> to the incomparable <HI>Cleo∣patra,</HI>
and my Enemies will be already van∣quish'd
—Victory will come over to the Side
you favour—and an Army of a hundred thou∣sand
Men will not be able to overcome the Man
who has your Commands to conquer—</P>
<P>How mean and insignificant, pursued she,
are the Titles bestow'd on other Monarchs com∣par'd
with those which dignify the Sovereigns of
Hearts, such as divine Arbitress of my Fate,
Visible Divinity, Earthly Goddess, and many
others equally sublime—</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="230"/>
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> losing all patience at her obsti∣nate
Folly, interrupted her here with a Question
quite foreign to the Subject she was discussing,
and soon after quitting her Chamber, retir'd to
his own, more than ever despairing of her Re∣covery.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which is introduc'd a very singular
Character.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MISS <HI>Glanville,</HI> whose Envy and Dislike
of her lovely Cousin was heighten'd by
her Suspicions that she disputed with her the
Possession of Sir <HI>George</HI>'s Heart, she having
been long in reality a great Admirer of that gay
Gentleman, was extremely delighted with the
Ridicule her absurd Behaviour had drawn upon
her at <HI>Bath,</HI> which she found by Enquiry was
thro' Mr. <HI>Tinsel</HI>'s Representation grown almost
general.</P>
<P>In order therefore to be at Liberty to go to the
Publick Places un-eclips'd by the superior Beau∣ty
of <HI>Arabella,</HI> she acquainted her Father and
Brother with Part of what she had heard, which
determin'd them to prevent that young Lady's
Appearance in Publick while they staid at <HI>Bath;</HI>
this being no difficult Matter to bring about,
since <HI>Arabella</HI> only went to the Rooms or Pa¦rade
in Compliance with the Invitation of her
Cousins.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="231"/>
Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> being by these Means rid of a
Rival too powerful even to contend with, went
with more than usual Gaiety to the Assembly,
where the Extravagancies of <HI>Arabella</HI> afforded
a perpetual Fund for Diversion. Her more
than passive Behaviour upon this Occasion, ba∣nishing
all Restraint among those she convers'd
with, the Jest circulated very freely at <HI>Arabella</HI>'s
Expence. Nor did Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> fail to give
new Poignancy to their Sarcasms, by artfully
disclosing the bent of her Cousin's Studies, and
enumerating the many Absurdities they had
made her guilty of.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI>'s uncommon Beauty had gain'd her
so many Enemies among the Ladies that com∣pos'd
this Assembly, that they seem'd to con∣tend
with each other who should ridicule her
most. The celebrated Countess of—be∣ing
then at <HI>Bath,</HI> approach'd a Circle of these
fair Defamers, and listning a few Moments to
the contemptuous Jests they threw out against
the absent Beauty, declar'd herself in her Fa∣vour;
which in a Moment, such was the Force
of her universally acknowledg'd Merit, and the
Deference always pay'd to her Opinion, silenc'd
every pretty Impertinent around her.</P>
<P>This Lady, who among her own Sex had no
Superior in Wit, Elegance, and Ease, was in∣ferior
to very few of the other in Sense, Learn∣ing,
and Judgment. Her Skill in Poetry,
Painting, and Musick, tho' incontestably great,
was number'd among the least of her Accom∣plishments.
Her Candour, her Sweetness, her
Modesty and Benevolence, while they secur'd
her from the Darts of Envy, render'd her su∣perior
<PB N="230" REF="232"/>
to Praise, and made the one as unneces∣sary
as the other ineffectual.</P>
<P>She had been a Witness of the Surprize
<HI>Arabella</HI>'s extraordinary Appearance had occa∣sion'd,
and struck with that as well as the un∣common
Charms of her Person, had prest near
her with several others of the Company, when
she was discoursing in the Manner we have re∣lated.</P>
<P>A Person of the Countess's nice Discern∣ment
could not fail of observing the Wit and
Spirit, which tho' obscur'd, was not abso∣lutely
hid under the Absurdity of her No∣tions.
And this Discovery adding Esteem to
the Compassion she felt for the fair Visionary,
she resolv'd to rescue her from the ill-natur'd
Raillery of her Sex; praising therefore her
Understanding, and the Beauty of her Person
with a Sweetness and Generosity peculiar to
herself, she accounted in the most delicate
Manner imaginable for the Singularity of her
Notions, from her Studies, her Retirment, her
Ignorance of the World, and her lively Ima∣gination.
And to abate the Keenness of their
Sarcasms, acknowledg'd, that she herself had
when very young, been deep read in Roman∣ces;
and but for an early Acquaintance with
the World, and being directed to other Studies,
was likely to have been as much a Heroine as
Lady <HI>Bella.</HI></P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> tho' she was secretly vex'd at
this Defence of her Cousin, was however under
a Necessity of seeming oblig'd to the Countess
for it: And that Lady expressing a Desire to be
acquainted with Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> Miss <HI>Glanville</HI>
<PB N="231" REF="233"/>
respectfully offer'd to attend her Cousin to her
Lodgings, which the Countess as respectfully
declin'd, saying, As Lady <HI>Bella</HI> was a Stranger,
she would make her the first Visit.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> at her Return gave her Bro∣ther
an Account of what had happen'd at the
Assembly, and fill'd him with an inconceivable
Joy at the Countess's Intention. He had al∣ways
been a zealous Admirer of that Lady's
Character, and flatter'd himself that the Con∣versation
of so admirable a Woman would be
of the utmost Use to <HI>Arabella.</HI></P>
<P>That very Night he mention'd her to his be∣loved
Cousin; and after enumerating all her
fine Qualities, declar'd that she had already con∣ceiv'd
a Friendship for her, and was solicitous of
her Acquaintance.</P>
<P>I think myself extremely fortunate, replied
<HI>Arabella,</HI> in that I have (tho' questionless un∣deservedly)
acquir'd the Amity of this lovely
Person; and I beg you, pursued she to Miss
<HI>Glanville,</HI> to tell her, that I long with Impa∣tience
to embrace her, and to give her that
Share in my Heart which her transcendent Me∣rit
deserves.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> only bow'd her Head in An∣swer
to this Request, giving her Brother at the
same Time a significant Leer; who tho' used
to <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Particularities, could not help be∣ing
a little confounded at the heroick Speech
she had made.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Containing something which at first Sight
may possibly puzzle the Reader.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Countess was as good as her Word,
and two Days after sent a Card to <HI>Ara∣bella,</HI>
importing her Design to wait on her that
Afternoon.</P>
<P>Our Heroine expected her with great Impa∣tience,
and the Moment she enter'd the Room
flew towards her with a graceful Eagerness, and
straining her in her Arms, embrac'd her with
all the Fervour of a long absent Friend.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles</HI> and Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> were equally
embarrass'd at the Familiarity of this Address;
but observing that the Countess seem'd not to
be surpriz'd at it, but rather to receive it with
Pleasure, they were soon compos'd.</P>
<P>You cannot imagine, lovely Stranger, said
<HI>Arabella</HI> to the Countess, as soon as they were
seated, with what Impatience I have long'd to
behold you, since the Knowledge I have receiv'd
of your rare Qualities, and the Friendship you
have been pleas'd to honour me with—And I
may truly protest to you, that such is my Ad∣miration
of your Virtues, that I would have
gone to the farthest Part of the World to ren∣der
you that which you with so much Genero∣sity
have condescended to bestow upon me.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles</HI> star'd at this extraordinary Speech,
and not being able to comprehend a Word of
it, was concern'd to think how the Lady to
whom it was address'd would understand it.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="235"/>
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> look'd down, and bit his Nails
in extreme Confusion; but the Countess who
had not forgot the Language of Romance, re∣turn'd
the Compliment in a Strain as heroick as
hers.</P>
<P>The Favour I have receiv'd from For∣tune,
said, she, in bringing me to the Happiness
of your Acquaintance, charming <HI>Arabella,</HI> is
so great, that I may rationally expect some ter∣rible
Misfortune will befall me: Seeing that in
this Life our Pleasures are so constantly succeed∣ed
by Pains, that we hardly ever enjoy the one
without suffering the other soon after.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> was quite transported to hear the
Countess express herself in Language so con∣formable
to her own; but Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> was
greatly confounded, and began to suspect she was
diverting herself with his Cousin's Singularities:
And Sir <HI>Charles</HI> was within a little of thinking
her as much out of the Way as his Niece.</P>
<P>Misfortunes, Madam, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> are too
often the Lot of excellent Persons like yourself.
The sublimest among Mortals both for Beauty
and Virtue have experienc'd the Frowns of Fate.
The Sufferings of the divine <HI>Statira</HI> or <HI>Cassan∣dra,</HI>
for she bore both Names, the Persecutions
of the incomparable <HI>Cleopatra,</HI> the Dissresses of
the beautiful <HI>Cundace,</HI> and the Afflictions of the
fair and generous <HI>Mandana,</HI> are Proofs that the
most illustrious Persons in the World have felt
the Rage of Calamity.</P>
<P>It must be confess'd, said the Countess, that
all those fair Princesses you have nam'd, were
for a while extremely unfortunate: Yet in the
Catalogue of these lovely and afflicted Persons
<PB N="234" REF="236"/>
you have forgot one who might with Justice
dispute the Priority of Sufferings with them all—
I mean the beautiful <HI>Elisa,</HI> Princess of <HI>Parthia.</HI></P>
<P>Pardon me, Madam, reply'd <HI>Arabella,</HI> I can∣not
be of your Opinion. The Princess of <HI>Par∣thia</HI>
may indeed justly be rank'd among the
Number of unfortunate Persons, but she can
by no means dispute the melancholy Precedence
with the divine <HI>Cleopatra</HI>—For in fine, Madam,
what Evils did the Princess of <HI>Parthia</HI> suffer
which the fair <HI>Cleopatra</HI> did not likewise en∣dure,
and some of them haply in a greater De∣gree?
If <HI>Elisa</HI> by the tyrannical Authority of
the King her Father, saw herself upon the Point
of becoming the Wife of a Prince she detested,
was not the beautiful Daughter of <HI>Antony,</HI> by
the more unjustifiable Tyranny of <HI>Augustus,</HI> likely
to be forced into the Arms of <HI>Tyberius,</HI> a proud
and cruel Prince, who was odious to the whole
World as well as to her? If <HI>Elisa</HI> was for some
time in the Power of Pyrates, was not <HI>Cleo∣patra</HI>
Captive to an inhuman King, who pre∣sented
his Sword to the fair Breast of that di∣vine
Princess worthy the Adoration of the
whole Earth? And in fine, if <HI>Elisa</HI> had the
Grief to see her dear <HI>Artaban</HI> imprison'd by the
Order of <HI>Augustus, Cleopatra</HI> beheld with mor∣tal
Agonies, her beloved <HI>Coriolanus</HI> inclos'd
amidst the Guards of that enrag'd Prince, and
doom'd to a cruel Death.</P>
<P>'Tis certain, Madam, reply'd the Countess,
that the Misfortunes of both these Princesses
were very great, tho' as you have shew'd me
with some Inequality: And when one reflects
upon the dangerous Adventures to which Per∣sons
<PB N="235" REF="237"/>
of their Quality were expos'd in those
Times, one cannot help rejoicing that we live
in an Age in which the Customs, Manners,
Habits, and Inclinations differ so widely from
theirs, that 'tis impossible such Adventures
should even happen.</P>
<P>Such is the strange Alteration of Things, that
some People I dare say at present, cannot be per∣suaded
to believe there ever were Princesses wan∣dering
thro' the World by Land and Sea in mean
Disguises, carry'd away violently out of their Fa∣ther's
Dominions by insolent Lovers—Some
discover'd sleeping in Forests, other Shipwreck'd
on desolate Islands, confin'd in Castles, bound
in Chariots, and even strugling amidst the tem∣pestuous
Waves of the Sea, into which they
had cast themselves to avoid the brutal Force of
their-Ravishers. Not one of these Things hav∣ing
happen'd within the Compass of several
thousand Years, People unlearn'd in Antiquity
would be apt to deem them idle Tales, so im∣probable
do they appear at present.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> tho' greatly surpriz'd at this Dis∣course,
did not think proper to express her
Thoughts of it. She was unwilling to appear
absolutely ignorant of the present Customs of
the World, before a Lady whose good Opinion
she was ardently desirous of improving. Her
Prepossessions in favour of the Countess made
her receive the new Delights she held out to her
with Respect, tho' not without Doubt and Ir∣resolution.
Her Blushes, her Silence, and
down-cast Eyes gave the Countess to understand
Part of her Thoughts; who for fear of alarm∣ing
her too much for that Time, dropt the
<PB N="236" REF="238"/>
Subject, and turning the Conversation on others
more general, gave <HI>Arabella</HI> an Opportunity of
mingling in it with that Wit and Vivacity
which was natural to her when Romances
were out of the Question.</P>

<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which if the Reader has not antici∣pated
it, he will find an Explanation
of some seeming Inconsistencies in the
foregoing Chapter.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Countess, charm'd with the Wit
and good Sense of <HI>Arabella,</HI> could not
conceal her Admiration, but exprest it in Terms
the most obligingly imaginable: And <HI>Arabella,</HI>
who was excessively delighted with her, return'd
the Compliments she made her with the most
respectful Tenderness.</P>
<P>In the midst of these mutual Civilities,
<HI>Arabella</HI> in the Style of Romance, intreated
the Countess to favour her with the Recital of
her Adventures.</P>
<P>At the Mention of this Request, that Lady
convey'd so much Confusion into her Counte∣nance,
that <HI>Arabella</HI> extremely embarrass'd by
it, tho' she knew not why, thought it neces∣sary
to apologize for the Disturbance she seem'd
to have occasion'd in her.</P>
<P>Pardon me, Madam, reply'd the Countess
recovering herself, if the uncommoness of your
Request made a Moment's Reflexion necessary
<PB N="237" REF="239"/>
to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> that a young Lady of your
Sense and Delicacy could mean no Offence to
Decorum by making it. The Word Adven∣tures
carries in it so free and licentious a Sound
in the Apprehensions of People at this Period
of Time, that it can hardly with Propriety be
apply'd to those few and natural Incidents which
compose the History of a Woman of Honour.
And when I tell you, pursued she with a Smile,
that I was born and christen'd, had a useful
and proper Education, receiv'd the Addresses of
my Lord—through the Recommendation
of my Parents, and marry'd him with their
Consents and my own Inclination; and that
since we have liv'd in great Harmony together,
I have told you all the material Passages of my
Life, which upon Enquiry you will find differ
very little from those of other Women of the
same Rank, who have a moderate Share of
Sense, Prudence and Virtue.</P>
<P>Since you have already, Madam, replied
<HI>Arabella</HI> blushing, excus'd me for the Liberty
I took with you, it will be un-necessary to tell
you it was grounded upon the Customs of an∣tient
Times, when Ladies of the highest Rank
and sublimest Virtue, were often expos'd to a
Variety of cruel Adventures which they im∣parted
in Confidence to each other, when
Chance brought them together.</P>
<P>Custom, said the Countess smiling, changes the
very Nature of Things, and what was honour∣able
a thousand Years ago, may probably be look'd
upon as infamous now—A Lady in the heroick
Age you speak of, would not be thought to pos∣sess
any great Share of Merit, if she had not
<PB N="238" REF="240"/>
been many times carried away by one or other
of her insolent Lovers: Whereas a Beauty in
this could not pass thro' the Hands of several
different Ravishers, without bringing an Impu∣tation
on her Chastity.</P>
<P>The same Actions which made a Man a
Hero in those Times, would constitute him a
Murderer in These—And the same Steps which
led him to a Throne Then, would infallibly
conduct him to a Scaffold Now.</P>
<P>But Custom, Madam, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> cannot
possibly change the Nature of Virtue or Vice:
And since Virtue is the chief Characteristick of
a Hero, a Hero in the last Age will be a Hero
in this—Tho' the Natures of Virtue or Vice
cannot be changed, replied the Countess, yet
they may be mistaken; and different Princi∣ples,
Customs, and Education, may probably
change their Names, if not their Natures.</P>
<P>Sure, Madam, said <HI>Arabella</HI> a little moved,
you do not intend by this Inference to prove
<HI>Oroondates, Artaxerxes, Juba, Artaban,</HI> and the
other Heroes of Antiquity, bad Men?</P>
<P>Judging them by the Rules of Christianity,
and our present Notions of Honour, Justice,
and Humanity, they certainly are, replied the
Countess.</P>
<P>Did they not possess all the necessary Quali∣fications
of Heroes, Madam, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> and
each in a superlative Degree?—Was not their
Valour invincible, their Generosity unbounded,
and their Fidelity inviolable?</P>
<P>It cannot be denied, said the Countess, but
that their Valour was invincible; and many
thousand Men less courageous than themselves,
<PB N="239" REF="241"/>
felt the fatal Effects of that invincible Valour,
which was perpetually seeking after Occasions
to exert itself. <HI>Oroondates</HI> gave many extraor∣dinary
Proofs of that unbounded Generosity so
natural to the Heroes of his Time. This Prince
being sent by the King his Father, at the Head
of an Army, to oppose the <HI>Persian</HI> Monarch,
who had unjustly invaded his Dominions, and
was destroying the Lives and Properties of his
Subjects; having taken the Wives and Daugh∣ters
of his Enemy Prisoners, had by these Means
an Opportunity to put a Period to a War so
destructive to his Country: Yet out of a Ge∣nerosity
truly heroick, he releas'd them imme∣diately
without any Conditions; and falling in
Love with one of those Princesses, secietly
quitted his Father's Court, resided several Years
in that of the Enemy of his Father and Coun∣try,
engag'd himself to his Daughter, and when
the War broke out again between the two
Kings, fought furiously against an Army in
which the King his Father was in Person, and
shed the Blood of his future Subjects without
Remorse; tho' each of those Subjects, we are
told, would have sacrific'd his Life to save that
of their Prince, so much was he belov'd▪
Such are the Actions which immortalize the
Heroes of Romance, and are by the Authors
of those Books styl'd glorious, godlike, and di∣vine.
Yet judging of them as Christians, we
shall find them impious and base, and directly
opposite to our present Notions of moral and re∣lative
Duties.</P>
<P>'Tis certain therefore, Madam, added the
Contess with a Smile, that what was Virtue in
<PB N="240" REF="242"/>
those Days, is Vice in ours: And to form a
Hero according to our Notions of 'em at pre∣sent,
'tis nessary to give him Qualities very dif∣ferent
from <HI>Oroondates.</HI></P>
<P>The secret Charm in the Countenance, Voice,
and Manner of the Countess, join'd to the
Force of her reasoning, could not fail of mak∣ing
some Impression on the Mind of <HI>Arabella;</HI>
but it was such an Impression as came far short
of Conviction. She was surpriz'd embarrass'd,
perplex'd, but not convinc'd. Heroism, roman∣tick
Heroism, was deeply rooted in her Heart;
it was her Habit of thinking, a Principle im∣bib'd
from Education. She could not separate
her Ideas of Glory, Virtue, Courage, Gene∣rosity,
and Honour, from the false Representa∣tions
of them in the Actions of <HI>Oroondates,
Juba, Artaxerxes,</HI> and the rest of the imaginary
Heroes. The Countess's Discourse had rais'd a
Kind of Tumult in her Thoughts, which gave
an Air of Perplexity to her lovely Face, and
made that Lady apprehensive she had gone too
far, and lost that Ground in her Esteem, which
she had endeavour'd to acquire by a Conformity
to some of her Notions and Language. In this
however, she was mistaken; <HI>Arabella</HI> felt a
Tenderness for her that had already the Force of
a long contracted Friendship, and an Esteem
little less than Veneration.</P>
<P>When the Countess took Leave, the Profes∣sions
of <HI>Arabella,</HI> tho' deliver'd in the Language
of Romance, were very sincere and affecting,
and were return'd with an equal Degree of
Tenderness by the Countess, who had conceiv'd
a more than ordinary Affection for her.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="243"/>
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> who could have almost wor∣ship'd
the Countess for the generous Design be
saw she had entertain'd, took an Opportunity
as he handed her to her Chair, to intreat in a
Manner as earnestly as polite, that she would
continue the Happiness of her Acquaintance to
his Cousin; which with a Smile of mingled
Dignity and Sweetness she assur'd him of.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Which concludes Book the Eighth.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR. <HI>Glanville</HI> at his Return to the Dining-Room,
finding <HI>Arabella</HI> retir'd, told his
Father in a Rapture of Joy, that the charming
Countess would certainly make a Convert of
Lady <HI>Bella.</HI></P>
<P>Methinks, said the Baronet, she has as strange
Whims in her Head as my Niece. Ad's-heart,
what a deal of Stuff did she talk about! A
Parcel of Heroes as she calls them, with con∣founded
hard Names—In my Mind she is more
likely to make Lady <HI>Bella</HI> worse than better.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> a little vex'd at his Father's
Mis-apprehension, endeavour'd with as much
Delicacy as he could, to set him right with Re∣gard
to the Countess; so that he brought him
at last to confess she manag'd the Thing very
well.</P>
<P>The Countess, who had resolv'd to take
<HI>Arabella</HI> openly into her Protection, was think∣ing
on Means to engage her to appear at the
<PB N="242" REF="244"/>
Assembly, whither she propos'd to accompany
her in a modern Dress. But her good Intenti∣ons
towards our lovely Heroine were suspended
by the Account she receiv'd of her Mother's
Indisposition, which commanded her immedi∣ate
Attendance on her at her Seat in—</P>
<P>Her sudden Departure gave <HI>Arabella</HI> an ex∣treme
Uneasiness, and proved a cruel Disap∣pointment
to Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who had founded
all his Hopes of her Recovery on the Conver∣sation
of that Lady.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles</HI> having Affairs that requir'd his
Presence in <HI>London,</HI> propos'd to his Niece the
leaving <HI>Bath</HI> in a few Days, to which she con∣sented;
and accordingly they set out for <HI>Lon∣don</HI>
in <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Coach and Six, attended by
several Servants on Horseback, her Women
having been sent away before in the Stage.</P>
<P>Nothing very remarkable happen'd during
this Journey, so we shall not trouble our Read∣ers
with several small Mistakes of <HI>Arabella</HI>'s
such as her supposing a neat Country Girl who
was riding behind a Man, to be some Lady or
Princess in Disguise, forc'd away by a Lover
she hated, and intreating Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> to at∣tempt
her Rescue; which occasion'd some
little Debate between her and Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> who
could not be persuaded to believe it was as she
said, and forbid his Son to meddle in other
Peoples Affairs. Several of these Sort of Mi∣stakes,
as we said before, we omit, and will
therefore if our Reader pleases, bring our He∣roine
without further Delay to <HI>London.</HI></P>

<P>In which is related an admirable Ad∣venture.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>ISS <HI>Glanville</HI> whose Spirits were
greatly exhilerated at their En∣trance
into <HI>London,</HI> that Seat of
Magnificence and Pleasure, con∣gratulated
her Cousin upon the
Entertainment she would receive from the new
and surprizing Objects which every Day for a
considerable Time would furnish her with; and
ran over the Catalogue of Diversions with such
a Volubility of Tongue, as drew a gentle Re∣primand
from her Father, and made her keep
a sullen Silence till they were set down in
<PB N="244" REF="246"/>
St. <HI>James</HI>'s Square, the Place of their Residence
in Town.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles</HI> having order'd his late Lady's
Apartment to be prepar'd for the Accommoda∣tion
of his Niece; as soon as the first Civilities
were over, she retir'd to her Chamber, where
she employ'd herself in giving her Women Di∣rections
for placing her Books, of which she
had brought a moderate Quantity to <HI>London,</HI> in
her Closet.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> as soon as she had dispatch'd
away some hundred Cards to her Acquaintance,
to give them Notice she was in Town, attend∣ed
<HI>Arabella</HI> in her own Apartment; and as they
sat at the Tea she begun to regulate the Diver∣sions
of the Week, naming the Drawing-Room,
Park, Concert, <HI>Ranelagh,</HI> Lady—As∣sembly,
the Dutchess of <HI>Rant, Vaux-Hall,</HI> and
a long <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of Visits; at which <HI>Arabella,</HI> with
an Accent that express'd her Surprize, ask'd
her, If she suppos'd she intended to stay in
Town three or four Years—</P>
<P>Law, Cousin, said Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> all this is
but the Amusement of a few Days.</P>
<P>Amusement, do you say, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI>
methinks it seems to be the sole Employment of
those Days: And what you call the Amuse∣ment,
must of Necessity be the Business of Life.</P>
<P>You are always so grave, Cousin, said Miss
<HI>Glanville,</HI> one does not know what to say to
you. However, I shan't press you to go to
Publick Places against your Inclination, yet you'll
condescend to receive a few Visits, I suppose?</P>
<P>Yes, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> and if among the La∣dies
whom I shall see, I find any like the amia∣ble
<PB N="245" REF="247"/>
Countess of —, I shall not scruple to
enter into the most tender Amity with them.</P>
<P>The Countess of — is very well, to be sure,
said Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> yet I don't know how it is,
she does not suit my Taste—She is very par∣ticular
in a great many Things, and knows too
much for a Lady, as I heard my Lord <HI>Fribble</HI>
say one Day: Then she is quite unfashionable:
She hates Cards, keeps no Assembly, is seen but
seldom at Publick Places; and in my Opinion,
as well as in a great many others, is the dullest
Company in the World. I'm sure I met her
at a Visit a little before I went down to your
Seat, and she had not been a quarter of an Hour
in the Room, before she set a whole Circle of
Ladies a yawning.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> tho' she had a sincere Contempt for
her Cousin's Manner of thinking, yet always
politely conceal'd it; and vex'd as she was at
her Sneers upon the Countess, she contented
herself with gently defending her, telling her at
the same Time, that till she met with a Lady
who had more Merit than the Countess pos∣sess'd,
she should always possess the first Place
in her Esteem.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> who had from Youth adopted
the Resentments of her Father, refus'd to make
her Appearance at Court, which Sir <HI>Charles</HI>
gently intimated to her; yet being not wholly
divested of the Curiosity natural to her Sex, she
condescended to go <HI>incog.</HI> to the Gallery on a
B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll Night, accompanied by Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> and
his Sister, in order to behold the Splendor of the
<HI>British</HI> Court.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="248"/>
As her Romances had long familiariz'd her
Thoughts to Objects of Grandeur and Magni∣ficence,
she was not so much struck as might
have been expected, with those that now pre∣sented
themselves to her View. Nor was she
a little disappointed to find that among the Men
she saw none whose Appearance came up to her
Ideas of the Air and Port of an <HI>Artaban, Oroon∣dates,</HI>
or <HI>Juba;</HI> or any of the Ladies, who did
not in her Opinion, fall short of the Perfections
of <HI>Elisa, Mandana, Statira,</HI> &amp;c. 'Twas re∣markable
too, that she never enquir'd how often
the Princesses had been carried away by capti∣vated
Monarchs, or how many Victories the
King's Sons had gain'd; but seem'd the whole
Time she was there to have suspended all her
Romantick Ideas of Glory, Beauty, Gallantry,
and Love.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> was highly pleas'd with her
compos'd Behaviour, and a Day or two after
intreated her to allow him the Honour of shew∣ing
her what was remarkable and worthy of her
Observation in this great Metropolis. To this
she also consented, and for the greater Privacy
began their Travels in a hir'd Coach.</P>
<P>Part of several Days were taken up in this
Employment; but Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> had the Mor∣tification
to find she was full of Allusions to her
Romances upon every Occasion, such as her
asking the Person who shews the Armoury at
the <HI>Tower,</HI> the Names of the Knights to whom
each Suit belong'd, and wondering there were no
Devices on the Shields or Plumes of Feathers
in the Helmets: She observ'd that the Lyon <HI>Ly∣simachus</HI>
kill'd, was according to the History of
<PB N="247" REF="249"/>
that Prince, much larger than any of those she
was shew'd in the <HI>Tower,</HI> and also much fiercer.
Took Notice that St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s was less magnifi∣cent
in the Inside, than the Temple in which
<HI>Cyrus,</HI> when he went to <HI>Mandana,</HI> heard her
return Thanks for his suppos'd Death: En∣quir'd
if it was not customary for the King and
his whole Court to sail in Barges upon the
<HI>Thames,</HI> as <HI>Augustus</HI> used to do upon the <HI>Tyber,</HI>
whether they had not Musick and Collations
in the Park, and where they celebrated the Justs
and Tournaments.</P>
<P>The Season for <HI>Vaux-Hall</HI> being not yet over,
she was desirous of once seeing a Place, which
by the Description she had heard of it, greatly
resembled the Gardens of <HI>Lucullus</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> in
which the Emperor, with all the Princes and
Princesses of his Court were so nobly entertain'd,
and where so many gallant Conversations had
pass'd among those admirable Persons.</P>
<P>The Singularity of her Dress, for she was
cover'd with her Veil, drew a Number of
Gazers after her, who prest round her with so
little Respect, that she was greatly embarrass'd,
and had Thoughts of quitting the Place, de∣lightful
as she own'd it, immediately, when her
Attention was wholly engross'd by an Adven∣ture
in which she soon interested herself very
deeply.</P>
<P>An Officer of Rank in the Sea Service had
brought his Mistress disguis'd in a Suit of Man's
or rather Boy's Cloaths, and a Hat and Fea∣ther,
into the Gardens. The young Creature
being a little intoxicated with the Wine she had
taken too freely, was thrown so much off her
<PB N="248" REF="250"/>
Guard as to give Occasion to some of the Com∣pany
to suspect her Sex; and a gay Fellow, in
order to give them some Diversion at her Ex∣pence,
pretending to be affronted at something
she said, drew his Sword upon the disguis'd Fair
One, which so alarm'd her, that she shriek'd
out, She was a Woman, and ran for Protection
to her Lover, who was so dis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rder'd with Liquor,
that he was not able to defend her.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> ever curious and inquisitive,
demanded the Cause why the Company ran in
Crouds to that particular Spot; and receiv'd
for Answer, That a Gentleman had drawn his
Sword upon a Lady disguis'd in a Man's Habit.</P>
<P>Oh Heav'ns! cry'd <HI>Arabella,</HI> this must cer∣tainly
be a very notable Adventure. The Lady
has doubtless some extraordinary Circumstances
in her Story, and haply upon Enquiry, her Mis∣fortunes
will be found to resemble those which
oblig'd the beautiful <HI>Aspasia</HI> to put on the same
Disguise, who was by that Means murder'd by
the cruel <HI>Zenodorus</HI> in a Fit of Jealousy at the
Amity his Wife exprest for her. But can I
not see this unfortunate Fair One, added she,
pressing in spite of Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>'s Intreaties
thro' the Croud—I may haply be able to afford
her some Consolation.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> finding his Persuasions were
not regarded, follow'd her with very little Dif∣ficulty:
For her Veil falling back in her Hurry,
she did not mind to replace it, and the Charms
of her Face, join'd to the Majesty of her Per∣son,
and Singularity of her Dress, attracting
every Person's Attention and Respect, they
made Way for her to pass, not a little surpriz'd
<PB N="249" REF="251"/>
at the extreme Earnestness and Solemnity that
appear'd in her Countenance upon an Event so
diverting to every one else.</P>
<P>The disguis'd Lady whom she was endea∣vouring
to approach, had thrown herself upon
a Bench in one of the Boxes, trembling still
with the Apprehension of the Sword, tho' her
Antagonist was kneeling at her Feet, making
Love to her in Mock-Heroicks for the Diver∣sion
of the Company.</P>
<P>Her Hat and Peruke had fallen off in her
Fright, and her Hair which had been turn'd
up under it, hung now loosely about her Neck,
and gave such an Appearance of Woe to a Face,
which notwithstanding the Paleness that Terror
had overspread it with, was really extremely
pretty, that <HI>Arabella</HI> was equally struck with
Compassion and Admiration of her.</P>
<P>Lovely Unknown, said she to her with an
Air of extreme Tenderness, tho' I am a Stran∣ger
both to your Name and History, yet your
Aspect persuading me your Quality is not mean,
and the Condition and Disguise in which I be∣hold
you, shewing that you are Unfortunate, per∣mit
me to offer you all the Assistances in my Pow∣er,
seeing that I am mov'd thereto by my Com∣passion
for your Distress, and that Esteem which
the Sight of you must necessarily inspire.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> was struck dumb with Confu∣sion
at this strange Speech, and at the Whispers
and Scoffs it occasion'd among the Spectators. He
attempted to take hold of her Hand in order to
lead her away, but she disengag'd herself from
him with a Frown of Displeasure; and taking
no Notice of Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> who whisper'd
<PB N="250" REF="252"/>
with great Emotion, Lord, Cousin, how you
expose yourself! prest nearer to the Beautiful
Disguis'd, and again repeated her Offers of
Service.</P>
<P>The Girl being perfectly recover'd from her
Intoxication by the Fright she had been in, gaz'd
upon <HI>Arabella</HI> with a Look of extreme Sur∣prize:
Yet being mov'd to respect by the Dig∣nity
of her Appearance, and strange as her
Words seem'd to be by the obliging Purport of
them, and the affecting Earnestness with which
they were deliver'd, she rose from her Seat and
thank'd her, with an Accept full of Regard
and Submission.</P>
<P>Fair Maid, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> taking her Hand,
let us quit this Place, where your Discovery
may probably subject you to more Dangers: If
you will be pleas'd to put yourself into my Pro∣tection,
and acquaint me with the History of
your Misfortunes; I have Interest enough with
a valiant Person who shall undertake to free you
from your Persecutions, and re-establish the
Repose of your Life.</P>
<P>The kneeling Hero, who as well as every
one else that were present, had gaz'd with Asto∣nishment
at <HI>Arabella</HI> during all this Passage,
perceiving she was about to rob him of the dis∣guis'd
Fair, seiz'd hold of the Hand she had at
Liberty, and swore he would not part with her.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> almost mad with Vexation,
endeavour'd to get <HI>Arabella</HI> away.</P>
<P>Are you mad, Madam, said he in a Whisper,
to make all this Rout about a Prostitute? Do
you see how every body stares at you? What
will they think—For Heav'ns sake let us be
gone.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="253"/>
What, Sir, replied <HI>Arabella</HI> in a Rage, Are
you base enough to leave this admirable Crea∣ture
in the Power of that Man, who is que∣stionless
her Ravisher; and will you not draw
your Sword in her Defence?</P>
<P>Hey day! cry'd the Sea-Officer, wak'd out of
his stupid Dose by the Clamour about him: What's
the Matter here—What are you doing? Where's
my <HI>Lucy?</HI> Zoons! Sir, said he to the young
Fellow who held her, What Business have you
with my <HI>Lucy?</HI> And uttering a dreadful Oath,
drew out his Sword, and stagger'd towards his
gay Rival, who observing the Weakness of his
Antagonist, flourish'd with his Sword to shew
his Courage and frighten the Ladies, who all
ran away screaming. <HI>Arabella</HI> taking Miss
<HI>Glanville</HI> under the Arm, cried out to Mr.
<HI>Glanville</HI> as she left the Place, to take Care of
the distress'd Lady, and while the two Comba∣tants
were disputing for her, to carry her away
in Safety.</P>
<P>But Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> without regarding this In∣junction,
hasten'd after her; and to pacify her,
told her the Lady was rescu'd by her favourite
Lover, and carry'd off in Triumph.</P>
<P>But are you sure, said <HI>Aabella,</HI> it was not
some other of her Ravishers who carry'd her
away, and not the Person whom she has haply
favour'd with her Affection? May not the same
Thing have happen'd to her, as did to the beau∣tiful
<HI>Candace,</HI> Queen of <HI>Ethiopia;</HI> who while
two of her Ravishers were fighting for her, a
third whom she took for her Deliverer, came
and carry'd her away.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="254"/>
But she went away willingly, I assure you,
Madam, said Mr. <HI>Glanville:</HI> Pray don't be in
any Concern about her—</P>
<P>If she went away willingly with him, reply'd
<HI>Arabella,</HI> 'tis probable it may not be another
Ravisher: And yet if this Person that rescu'd
her happen'd to be in Armour, and the Vizor
of his Helmet down, she might be mistaken as
well as Queen <HI>Candace.</HI></P>
<P>Well, well, he was not in Armour, Madam,
said <HI>Glanville</HI> almost beside himself with Vexation
at her Folly—</P>
<P>You seem to be disturb'd, Sir, said <HI>Arabella</HI>
a little surpriz'd at his peevish Tone: Is there
any Thing in this Adventure which concerns
you? Nay, now I remember, you did not of∣fer
to defend the Beautiful Unknown. I am
not willing to impute your In-action upon such
an Occasion, to Want of Courage or Genero∣sity;
perhaps you are acquainted with her Hi∣story,
and from this Knowledge refus'd to en∣gage
in her Defence.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> perceiving the Company gather
from all Parts to the Walk they were in, told
her he would acquaint her with all he knew
concerning the disguis'd Lady when they were
in the Coach on their Return Home; and <HI>Ara∣bella</HI>
impatient for the promis'd Story, propos'd
to leave the Gardens immediately, which was
gladly comply'd with by Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who
heartily repented his having carry'd her thither.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Which ends with a very unfavourable Pre∣diction
for our Heroine.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS soon as they were seated in the Coach she
did not fail to call upon him to perform
his Promise: But Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> excessively out
of Humour at her exposing herself in the Gar∣dens,
reply'd, without considering whether he
shuld not offend her, That he knew no more
of the disguis'd Lady than any body else in the
Place.</P>
<P>How, Sir, reply'd <HI>Arabella,</HI> Did you not
promise to relate her Adventures to me? And
would you have me believe you knew no more
of them than the rest of the Cavaliers and La∣dies
in the Place?</P>
<P>Upon my Soul, I don't, Madam, said <HI>Glan∣ville;</HI>
yet what I know of her is sufficient to
let me understand she was not worth the Con∣sideration
you seem'd to have for her.</P>
<P>She cannot sure be more indiscreet than the
fair and unfortunate <HI>Hermione,</HI> reply'd <HI>Arabella;</HI>
who like her put on Man's Apparel, through
Despair at the ill Success of her Passion for <HI>Alex∣ander</HI>
—And certain it is, that tho' the beautiful
<HI>Hermione</HI> was guilty of one great Error which
lost her the Esteem of <HI>Alexander,</HI> yet she had a
high and noble Soul; as was manifest by her
Behaviour and Words when she was run thro'
by the Sword of <HI>Demetrius.</HI> Oh! Death, cry'd
she, as she was falling, how sweet do I find
<PB N="254" REF="256"/>
thee, and how much and how earnestly have I
desir'd thee!</P>
<P>Oh Lord! oh Lord! cry'd Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>
hardly sensible of what he said, Was there ever
any Thing so intolerable?</P>
<P>Do you pity the unhappy <HI>Hermione,</HI> Sir? said
<HI>Arabella</HI> interpreting his Exclamation her own
Way? Indeed she is well worthy of your Com∣passion.
And if the bare Recital of the Words
she utter'd at receiving her Death's Wound af∣fects
you so much, you may guess what would
have been your Agonies, had you been <HI>Deme∣trius</HI>
that gave it to her.</P>
<P>Here Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> groaning aloud thro' Im∣patience
at her Absurdities—</P>
<P>This Subject affects you deeply, I perceive,
said <HI>Arabella.</HI> There is no Question but you
would have acted in the same Circumstance, as
<HI>Demetrius</HI> did: Yet let me tell you, the Ex∣travagancy
of his Rage and Despair for what
he had innocently committed, was imputed to
him as a great Imbecillity, as was also the vio∣lent
Passion he conceiv'd soon after for the Fair
<HI>Deidamia.</HI> You know the Accident which
brought that fair Princess into his Way.</P>
<P>Indeed, I do not, Madam, said <HI>Glanville</HI>
peevishly.</P>
<P>Well, then I'll tell you, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> but
pausing a little:</P>
<P>The Recital I have engag'd myself to make,
added she, will necessarily take up some Hours
Time, as upon Reflexion I have found: So if
you will dispense with my beginning it at pre∣sent,
I will satisfy your Curiosity To-morrow,
when I may be able to pursue it without Inter∣ruption.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="257"/>
To this Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> made no other An∣swer
than a Bow with his Head; and the Coach
a few Moments after arriving at their own
House, he led her to her Apartment, firmly
resolv'd never to attend her to any more Publick
Places while she continued in the same ridicu∣lous
Folly.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> who had several Times been in
doubt whether <HI>Arabella</HI> was not really disorder'd
in her Senses; upon Miss <HI>Glanville</HI>'s Account
of her Behaviour at the Gardens, concluded
she was absolutely mad, and held a short Debate
with himself, Whether he ought not to bring
a Commission of Lunacy against her, rather
than marry her to his Son, whom he was per∣suaded
could never be happy with a Wife so un∣accountably
absurd. Tho' he only hinted at
this to Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> in a Conversation he had
with him while his Dissatisfaction was at its
Height, concerning <HI>Arabella,</HI> yet the bare Sup∣position
that his Father ever thought of such a
Thing, threw the young Gentleman into such
Agonies, that Sir <HI>Charles</HI> to compose him, pro∣tested
he would do nothing in relation to his
Niece that he would not approve of. Yet he
expostulated with him on the Absurdity of her
Behaviour, and the Ridicule to which she ex∣pos'd
herself wherever she went; appealing to
him, whether in a Wife he could think those
Follies supportable, which in a Mistress occasion'd
him so much Confusion.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> as much in Love as he was,
felt all the Force of this Inference, and acknow∣ledg'd
to his Father, That he could not think
of marrying <HI>Arabella,</HI> till the Whims her Ro∣mances
<PB N="256" REF="258"/>
had put into her Head, were craz'd by
a better Knowledge of Life and Manners. But
he added with a Sigh, That he knew not how
this Reformation would be effected; for she
had such a strange Facility in reconciling every
Incident to her own fantastick Ideas, that every
new Object added Strength to the fatal Deception
she laboured under.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which Arabella meets with another
admirable Adventure.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>OUR lovely Heroine had not been above a
Fortnight in <HI>London,</HI> before the gross Air
of that smoaky Town affected her Health so
much, that Sir <HI>Charles</HI> propos'd to her to go for
a few Weeks to <HI>Richmond,</HI> where he hir'd a
House elegantly furnish'd for her Reception.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> had been too long out of that
darling City, to pay her the Compliment of at∣tending
her constantly at <HI>Richmond;</HI> yet she
promis'd to be as often as possible with her: And
Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> having Affaris that could not dis∣pense
with his Absence from town, plac'd his
Steward in her House, being a Person whose
Prudence and Fidelity he could rely upon; and
he, with her Women, and two or three other
menial Servants, made up her Equipage.</P>
<P>As it was not consistent with Decorum for
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> to reside in her House, he con∣tented
himself with riding to <HI>Richmond</HI> generally
<PB N="257" REF="259"/>
every Day: And as long as <HI>Arabella</HI> was pleas'd
with that Retirement, he resolv'd not to
press her Return to Town till the Countess
of—arriv'd, in whose Conversation he
grounded all his Hopes of her Cure.</P>
<P>At that Season of the Year <HI>Richmond</HI> not
being quite deserted by Company, <HI>Arabella</HI> was
visited by several Ladies of Fashion; who
charm'd with her Affability, Politeness, and
good Sense, were strangely perplex'd how to ac∣count
for some Peculiarities in her Dress and
Manner of thinking.</P>
<P>Some of the younger Sort from whom <HI>Arabella</HI>'s
extraordinary Beauty took away all Pretensions
to Equality on that Score, made themselves ex∣tremely
merry with her Oddnesses, as they call'd
them, and gave broad Intimations that her
Head was not right.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Arabella,</HI> whose Taste was as delicate,
Sentiments as refin'd, and Judgment as clear as
any Person's could be who believ'd the Authen∣ticity
of <HI>Scudery</HI>'s Romances, she was strange∣ly
disappointed to find no Lady with whom she
could converse with any tolerable Pleasure: And
that instead of <HI>Clelia</HI>'s, <HI>Statira</HI>'s <HI>Mandana</HI>'s, &amp;c.
she found only Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> among all she
knew.</P>
<P>The Comparison she drew between such as
these and the charming Countess of—whom
she had just begun to be acquainted with at <HI>Bath,</HI>
increas'd her Regret for the Interruption that
was given to so agreeable a Friendship: And it
was with infinite Pleasure Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> heard
her repeatedly wish for the Arrival of that admi∣rable
Lady (as she always call'd her) in Town.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="260"/>
Not being able to relish that insipid Conver∣sation
of the young Ladies that visited her at
<HI>Richmond,</HI> her chief Amusement was to walk in
the Park there; which because of its Rural Priva∣cy,
was extremely agreeable to her Inclinations.</P>
<P>Here she indulg'd Contemplation, leaning on
the Arm of her faithful <HI>Lucy,</HI> while her other
Women walk'd at some Distance behind her, and
two Men Servants kept her always in Sight.</P>
<P>One Evening when she was returning from
her usual Walk, she heard the Sound of a Wo∣man's
Voice, which seem'd to proceed from a
Tuft of Trees that hid her from her View.
And stopping a Moment, distinguish'd some
plaintive Accents, which increasing her Curio∣sity,
she advanc'd towards the Place, telling
<HI>Lucy,</HI> she was resolv'd if possible to discover
who the distress'd Lady was, and what was the
Subject of her Affliction.</P>
<P>As she drew nearer with softly treading Steps,
she could distinguish through the Branches of
the Trees, now despoil'd of great part of their
Leaves, two Women seated on the Ground,
their Backs towards her, and one of them with
her Head gently reclin'd on the other's Shoulder,
seem'd by her mournful Action to be weeping;
for she often put her Handkerchief to her Eyes,
breathing every Time a Sigh, which, as <HI>Arabella</HI>
phras'd it, seem'd to proceed from the deepest
Recesses of her Heart.</P>
<P>This Adventure, more worthy indeed to be
styl'd an Adventure than all our Fair Heroine
had ever yet met with, and so conformable to
what she had read in Romances, fill'd her Heart
with eager Expectation. She made a Sign to
<PB N="259" REF="261"/>
<HI>Lucy</HI> to make no Noise, and creeping still closer
towards the Place where this afflicted Person
sat, she heard her distinctly utter these Words,
which however were often interrupted with her
Sighs.</P>
<P>Ah! <HI>Ariamenes,</HI> whom I to my Misfortune
have too much loved, and whom to my Mis∣fortune
I fear I shall never sufficiently hate,
since that Heav'n and thy cruel Ingratitude hath
ordain'd that thou shalt never be mine, and that
so many sweet and dear Hopes are for ever
taken from me, return me at least, ungrateful
Man, return me those Testimonies of my in∣nocent
Affection, which were sometimes so
dear and precious to thee. Return me those
Favours, which all innocent as they were, are
become Criminal by thy Crime. Return me,
Cruel Man, return me those Reliques of my
Heart which thou detainest in Despight of me,
and which, notwithstanding thy Infidelity, I
cannot recover.</P>
<P>Here her Tears interrupting her Speech,
<HI>Arabella</HI> being impatient to know the History
of this afflicted Person, came softly round to
the other Side, and shewing herself, occasion'd
some Disturbance to the sad Unknown; who
rising from her Seat, with her Face averted, as
if asham'd of having so far disclos'd her Sor∣rows
in a Stranger's Hearing, endeavour'd to
pass by her un-notic'd.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> perceiving her Design, stop'd her
with a very graceful Action, and with a Voice
all compos'd of Sweetness, earnestly conjur'd
her to relate her History.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="262"/>
Think not, Lovely Unknown, said she (for
she was really very pretty) that my Endeavours
to detain you proceed from an indiscreet Curio∣sity.
'Tis true, some Complaints which have
fallen from your fair Mouth, have rais'd in me a
Desire to be acquainted with your Adventures;
but this Desire has its Foundation in that Com∣passion
your Complaints have fill'd me with:
And if I wish to know your Misfortunes,
'tis only with a View of affording you some
Consolation.</P>
<P>Pardon me, Madam, said the Fair Afflicted,
gazing on <HI>Arabella</HI> with many Signs of Ad∣miration,
if my Confusion at being over-heard
in a Place I had chosen to bewail my Misfor∣tunes,
made me be guilty of some Appearance
of Rudeness, not seeing the admirable Person I
wanted to avoid. But pursued she, hesitating
a little, those Characters of Beauty I behold in
your Face, and the Gracefulness of your De∣portment
convincing me you can be of no or∣dinary
Rank, I will the less scruple to acquaint
you with my Adventures, and the Cause of
those Complaints you have heard proceed from
my Mouth.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> assuring her, that whatever her Mis∣fortunes
were, she might depend upon all the
Assistance in her Power, seated herself near her
at the Foot of the Tree where she had been fit∣ting,
and giving <HI>Lucy</HI> Orders to join the rest of
her Women, and stay at a Distance till she
made a Sign to them to advance, she pre∣par'd
to listen to the Adventures of the Fair
Unknown, who after some little Pause, began
to relate them in this Manner.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which is related the History of the
Princess of Gaul.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MY Name, Madam, is <HI>Cynccia,</HI> my Birth
Illustrious enough, seeing that I am the
Daughter of a Sovereign Prince, who possesses
a large and spacious Territory in what is now
called Antient <HI>Gaul.</HI></P>
<P>What, Madam, interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> Are
you a Princess then?</P>
<P>Questionless I am, Madam, replied the La∣dy;
and a Princess happy and prosperous, till
the Felicity of my Life was interrupted by the
perfidious <HI>Ariamenes.</HI></P>
<P>Pardon me, Madam, interrupted <HI>Arabella</HI>
again, that my Ignorance of your Quality
made me be deficient in those Respects which
are due to your high Birth, and which notwith∣standing
those Characters of Greatness I might
read in the Lineaments of your Visage, I yet
neglected to p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y—</P>
<P>Alas! Madam, said the Stranger, that little
Beauty which the Heavens bestow'd on me
only to make me wretched, as by the Event it
has proved, has long since taken its Flight, and
together with my Happiness, I have lost that
which made me Unhappy. And certain it is,
Grief has made such Ravages among what might
once have been thought tolerable in my Face,
that I should not be surpriz'd if my being no
longer Fair, should make you with Difficulty
believe I ever was so.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="264"/>
<HI>Arabella</HI> after a proper Compliment in An∣swer
to this Speech, intreated the Princess to go
on with her History, who hesitating a little,
comply'd with her Request.</P>
<P>Be pleas'd to know then, Madam, said she,
that being bred up with all imaginable Tender∣ness
in my Father's Court, I had no sooner
arriv'd to my Sixteenth Year than I saw myself
surrounded with Lovers; who nevertheless,
such was the Severity with which I behav'd
myself, conceal'd their Passions under a respect∣ful
Silence, well knowing Banishment from my
Presence was the least Punishment they had to
expect, if they presum'd to declare their Senti∣ments
to me.</P>
<P>I liv'd in this Fashion, Madam, for Two
Years longer, rejoicing in the Insensibility of
my own Heart, and triumphing in the Suffer∣ings
of others, when my Tranquillity was all
at once interrupted by an Accident which I am
going to relate to you.</P>
<P>The Princess stopt here to give Vent to some
Sighs which a cruel Remembrance forc'd from
her; and continuing in a deep Muse for five
or six Minutes, resum'd her Story in this
Manner.</P>
<P>It being my Custom to walk in a Forest
adjoining to one of my Father's Sum mer
Residences, attended only by my Women,
one Day when I was taking this A muse∣ment,
I perceiv'd at some Distance a Man ly∣ing
on the Ground; and impell'd by a sudden
Curiosity, I advanc'd towards this Person, whom
upon a nearer View I perceiv'd to have been
wounded very much, and fainted away through
<PB N="262" REF="265"/>
Loss of Blood. His Habit being very rich, I
concluded by that he was of no mean Quality:
But when I had look'd upon his Countenance,
pale and languishing as it was, methought there
appear'd so many Marks of Greatness, accom∣pany'd
with a Sweetness so happily blended, that
my Attention was engag'd in an extraordinary
Manner, and interested me so powerfully in his
Safety, that I commanded some of my Women
to run immediately for proper Assistance, and
convey him to the Castle, while I directed
others to throw some Water in his Face, and
to apply some Linen to his Wounds, to stop
the Bleeding.</P>
<P>These charitable Cares restor'd the wounded
Stranger to his Senses; he open'd his Eyes, and
turning them slowly to the Objects around him,
fix'd at last their languishing Looks on me:
When mov'd, as it should seem, to some Respect
by what he saw in my Countenance, he rose
with some Difficulty from the Ground, and
bowing almost down to it again, by that Action
seem'd to pay me his Acknowledgments for what
he suppos'd I had done for his Preservation.</P>
<P>His extreme Weakness having oblig'd him to
creep towards a Tree, against the Back of which
he supported himself, I went nearer to him, and
having told him the Condition in which I found
him, and the Orders I had dispatch'd for Assist∣ance,
requested him to acquaint me with his
Name and Quality, and the Adventure which
had brought him into that Condition.</P>
<P>My Name, Madam, answer'd he, is <HI>Aria∣menes,</HI>
my Birth is Noble enough; I have spent
some Years in my Travels, and was returning
<PB N="264" REF="266"/>
to my native Country, when passing thro' this
Forest I was seiz'd with an Inclination to sleep.
I had ty'd my Horse to a Tree, and retiring
some few Paces off, stretch'd myself at the Foot
of a large Oak whose Branches promis'd me an
agreeable Shade. I had not yet clos'd my Eyes,
when the Slumber I invited was dissipated by
the Sound of some Voices near me.</P>
<P>A Curiosity, not natural to me, made me
listen to the Discourse of these Persons, whom by
the Tone of their Voices, tho' I could not see
them, I knew to be Men.</P>
<P>In short, Madam, I was a Witness to a most
horrible Scheme which they concerted together;
my Weakness will not permit me to enter into
an exact Detail of all I heard: The Result of
their Conference was, To seize the Princess of
this Country and carry her off.</P>
<P>Here, pursued <HI>Cynecia,</HI> I interrupted the
Stranger with a loud Cry, which giving him
to understand who I was, he apologiz'd in the
most graceful Manner imaginable for the little
Respect he had hitherto paid me.</P>
<P>I then intreated him to tell me, If he had any
Opportunity of hearing the Name of my design'd
Ravisher; to which he reply'd, that he under∣stood
it to be <HI>Taxander.</HI></P>
<P>This Man, Madam, was one of my Father's
Favourites, and had been long secretly in Love
with me.</P>
<P><HI>Ariamenes</HI> then inform'd me, that being en∣flam'd
with Rage against these impious Villains,
he rose from the Ground, re-mounted his Horse,
and defy'd the two Traytors aloud, threatning
them with Death, unless they abandon'd their
impious Design.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="267"/>
<HI>Taxander</HI> made no Answer, but rush'd furi∣ously
upon him, and had the Biseness to suffer
his wicked Associate to assist him: But the va∣liant
<HI>Ariamenes,</HI> tho' he spoke modestly of his
Victory, yet gave me to understand that he had
made both the Villams abandon their wicked En∣terprize,
with their Lives; and that dismount∣ing
in order to see if they were quite dead, he
found himself so faint with the Wounds he had
received from them both, that he had not
Strength to re-mount his Horse; but crawling
on, in Hopes of meeting with some Assistance,
sainted away at last through Weariness and Loss
of Blood.</P>
<P>While he was giving me this Account, the
Chariot I had sent for arrived, and having made
him such Acknowledgments as the Obligation
I had received from him demanded, I caus'd
him to get into the Chariot, and sending one
with him to acquaint the Prince my Father
with all that had happen'd, and the Merit o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the valiant Stranger, I return'd the same Way
I came with my Women, my Thoughts being
wholly engross'd by this Unknown.</P>
<P>The Service he had done me fill'd me with a
Gratitude and Esteem for him, which prepar'd
my Heart for those tender Sentiments I after∣wards
entertain'd to the Ruin of my Repose.</P>
<P>I will not tire your Patience, Madam, with
a minute Detail of all the succeeding Passages
of my Story; it shall suffice to tell you, That
<HI>Ariamenes</HI> was received with extraordinary
Marks of Esteem by my Father; that his Cure
was soon compleated; and that having vow'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
himself to my Service, and declar'd an unal∣terable
<PB N="266" REF="268"/>
Passion for me, I permitted him to love
me, and gave him that Share in my Heart,
which I fear not all his Infidelities will ever de∣prive
him of.</P>
<P>His Attachment to me was soon suspected by
<HI>Taxander</HI>'s Relations, who having secretly
vow'd his Ruin, endeavour'd to discover if I
had admitted his Addresses, and having made
themselves Masters of our Secrets, by means of
the Treachery of one of my Women, procur'd
Information to be given to my Father of our
mutual Passion.</P>
<P>Alas! what Mischiefs did not this fatal Dis∣covery
produce: My Father, enrag'd to the
last Degree at this Intelligence, confin'd me to
my Apartments, and order'd <HI>Ariamenes</HI> to leave
his Dominions within three Days.</P>
<P>Spare me, Madam, the Repetition of what
pass'd at our last sad Interview, which by large
Bribes to my Guards, he obtain'd.</P>
<P>His Tears, his Agonies, his Vows of ever∣lasting
Fidelity, so sooth'd my Melancholy at
parting with him, and persuaded me of his
Constancy, that I waited for several Months
with perfect Tranquillity for the Performance
of the Promise he made me, to do my Father
such considerable Services in the War he was
engag'd in with one of his Neighbours, as should
oblige him to give me to him for his Reward.</P>
<P>But, alas! two Years roll'd on without
bringing back the unfaithful <HI>Ariamenes.</HI> My
Father died, and my Brother who succeeded
him, being about to force me to marry a Prince
whom I detested, I secretly quitted the Court, and
attended only by this faithful Confidant whom
<PB N="267" REF="269"/>
you behold with me, and some few of my trusty
Domesticks, I came hither in Search of <HI>Aria∣menes,</HI>
he having told me this Country was the
Place of his Birth.</P>
<P><HI>Polenor,</HI> the most prudent and faithful of my
Servants, undertook to find out the ungreateful
<HI>Ariamenes,</HI> whom yet I was willing to find Ex∣cuses
for, but all his Enquiries were to no Ef∣fect;
the Name of <HI>Ariamenes</HI> was not known
in this Part of the World.</P>
<P>Tir'd out with unsuccessful Enquiries, I re∣solv'd
to seek out some obscure Place, where I
might in secret lament my Misfortunes, and
expect the End of them in Death. My At∣tendants
found me out such a Retreat as I
wanted, in a neighbouring Village, which they
call <HI>Twickenham,</HI> I think, from whence I often
make Excursions to this Park, attended only as
you see; and here indulge myself in Com∣plaints
upon the Cruelty of my Destiny.</P>
<P>The sorrowful <HI>Cynecia</HI> here ended her Story,
to which in the Course of her Relation she had
given a great many Interruptions through the
Violence of her Grief: And <HI>Arabella,</HI> after
having said every thing she could think on to al∣leviate
her Affliction, earnestly intreated her to
accept of an Asylum at her House; where she
should be treated with all the Respect due to
her illustrious Birth.</P>
<P>The afflicted Lady, tho' she respectfully de∣clin'd
this Offer, yet express'd a great Desire of
commencing a strict Amity with our fair He∣roine,
who on her Part, made her the most
tender Protestations of Friendship.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="270"/>
The Evening being almost clos'd, they parted
with great Reluctancy on both Sides; mutually
promising to meet in the same Place the next
Day.</P>
<P><HI>Cynecia,</HI> having enjoin'd her new Friend ab∣solute
Secrecy, <HI>Arabella</HI> was under a Necessity
of keeping this Adventure to herself. And tho'
she long'd to tell Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who came to
visit her the next Day, that the Countess was
extremely mistaken, when she maintain'd there
were no more wandering Princesses in the
World, yet the Engagement she had submitted
to, kept her silent.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A very mysterious Chapter.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>ARABELLA,</HI> who impatiently long'd for
the Hour of meeting the fair Princess,
with whom she was extremely delighted, con∣sulted
her Watch so often, and discover'd so
much Restlessness and Anxiety, that Mr. <HI>Glan∣ville</HI>
began to be surpriz'd; and the more, as
she peremptorily commanded him not to attend
her in her Evening Walk. This Prohibition,
which, tho' he durst not dispute, he secretly re∣solv'd
to disobey; and as soon as she set out for
the Park with her usual Attendants, he slipp'd
out by a Back-door, and keeping her in his
Sight, himself unseen, she ventur'd to watch
her Motions.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="271"/>
As he had expected to unravel some great
Mystery, he was agreeably disappointed to find
she continu'd her Walk in the Park with great
Composure; and tho' she was soon join'd by the
imaginary Princess, yet conceiving her to be some
young Lady, with whom she had commenc'd an
Acquaintance at <HI>Richmond,</HI> his Heart was at Rest;
and for fear of displeasing her, he took a con∣trary
Path from that she was in, that he might
not meet her, yet resolv'd to stay till he thought
she would be inclin'd to return, and then shew
himself, and conduct her Home. A Solicitude
for which he did not imagine she need be of∣fended.</P>
<P>The two Ladies being met, after reciprocal
Compliments, the Princess intreated <HI>Arabella</HI>
to relate her Adventures; who not being wil∣ling
to violate the Laws of Romance, which
require an unbounded Confidence upon these
Occasions, began very succinctly to recount the
History of her Life; which, as she manag'd
it, contain'd Events almost as Romantick and
Incredible as any in her Romances; winding
them up with a Confession that she did not hate
Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> whom she acknowledg'd to be
one of the most faithful and zealous of Lovers.</P>
<P><HI>Cynecia</HI> with a Sigh, congratulated her upon
the Fidelity of a Lover, who by her Descrip∣tion,
was worthy the Place he possess'd in her
Esteem: And expressing a Wish, that she could
see, unobserv'd by him, this gallant and gene∣rous
Person, <HI>Arabella,</HI> who that Moment espy'd
him at a Distance, yet advancing towards them,
told her, with a Blush that overspread all her
Face, That her Curiosity might be satisfy'd in
<PB N="270" REF="272"/>
the Manner she wish'd, for, yonder, added she
is the Person we have been talking of.</P>
<P><HI>Cynecia,</HI> at these Words, looking towards
the Place where her fair Friend had directed;
no sooner cast her Eyes upon Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI>
than giving a loud Cry, she sunk into the Arms
of <HI>Arabella,</HI> who, astonish'd and perplex'd as
she was, eagerly held them out to support her.</P>
<P>Finding her in a Swoon, she dispatch'd. <HI>Lucy,</HI>
who was near her, to look for some Water to
throw in her Face; but that Lady breathing a
deep Sigh, open'd her languishing Eyes, and fix∣ing
a melancholy Look upon <HI>Arabella,</HI></P>
<P>Ah! Madam, said she, wonder not at my
Affliction and Surprize, since in the Person of
your Lover I behold the ungrateful <HI>Ariamenes.</HI></P>
<P>Oh Heav'ns! my fair Princess, replied <HI>Ara∣bella,</HI>
What is it you say? Is it possible <HI>Glan∣ville</HI>
can be <HI>Ariamenes?</HI></P>
<P>He, cried the afflicted Princess with a dis∣order'd
Accent, He whom I now behold! and
whom you call <HI>Glanville,</HI> was once <HI>Ariamenes,</HI>
the perjur'd, the ungrateful <HI>Ariamenes.</HI> Adieu,
Madam, I cannot bear this Sight; I will hide
myself from the World for ever; nor need you
fear a Rival or an Enemy in the unfortunate
<HI>Cynecia,</HI> who if possible, will cease to love the
unfaithful <HI>Ariamenes,</HI> and will never hate the
beautiful <HI>Arabella.</HI></P>
<P>Saying this, without giving her Time to an∣swer,
she took hold of her Confidant by the
Arm, and went away with so much Swiftness,
that she was out of sight before <HI>Arabella</HI> was
enough recover'd from her Astonishment to be
able to intreat her Stay.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="273"/>
Our charming Heroine, ignorant till now of
the true State of her Heart, was surpriz'd to
find it assaulted at once by all the Passions which
attend disappointed Love. Grief, Rage, Jea∣lousy,
and Despair made so cruel a War in her
gentle Bosom, that unable either to express or
to conceal the strong Emotions with which she
was agitated, she gave Way to a violent Burst
of Tears, leaning her Head upon <HI>Lucy</HI>'s Shoulder,
who wept as heartily as her Lady, tho' igno∣rant
of the Cause of her Affliction.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who was now near enough
to take Notice of her Posture, came running
with eager Heart to see what was the matter;
when <HI>Arabella,</HI> rous'd from her Extacy of Grief
by the Sound of his Steps, lifted up her Head,
and seeing him approach,</P>
<P><HI>Lucy,</HI> cried she, trembling with the Violence
of her Resentment, Tell that Traitor to keep
out of my Sight. Tell him, I forbid him ever
to appear before me again. And, tell him, ad∣ded
she, with a Sigh that shook her whole
tender Frame, All that Blood in his Body is too
little to wash away his Guilt, or to pacify my
Indignation.</P>
<P>Then hastily turning away, she ran towards
her other Attendants, who were at some Di∣stance;
and joining her Women, proceeded
directly Home.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> amaz'd at this Action, was
making after her as fast as he could, when <HI>Lucy</HI>
crossing in his Way, cry'd out to him to stop.</P>
<P>My Lady, said she, bid me tell you, Trai∣tor—</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="274"/>
Hey day! interrupted <HI>Glanville,</HI> What the
Devil does the Girl mean?</P>
<P>Pray Sir, said she, let me deliver my Mes∣sage:
I shall forget if you speak to me till I
have said it all—Stay, let me see, What comes
next?</P>
<P>No more Traitor, I hope, said <HI>Glanville.</HI></P>
<P>Nor, Sir, said <HI>Lucy;</HI> but there was some∣thing
about washing in Blood, and you must
keep out of her Sight, and not appear before
the Nation—Oh dear! I have forgot it half:
My Lady was in such a piteous Taking, I for∣got
it, I believe, as soon as she said it. What
shall I do?—</P>
<P>No Matter, said <HI>Glanville,</HI> I'll overtake her,
and ask—</P>
<P>No, no, Sir, said <HI>Lucy,</HI> Pray don't do that,
Sir, my Lady will be very angry: I'll venture
to ask her to tell me over again, and come back
and let you know it.</P>
<P>But tell me, reply'd <HI>Glanville,</HI> Was any thing
the Matter with your Lady? She was in a pi∣teous
Taking, you say.</P>
<P>Oh dear! yes, Sir, said <HI>Lucy;</HI> but I was not
bid to say any thing about that. To be sure,
my Lady did cry sadly, and sigh'd as if her
Heart would break; but I don't know what
was the Matter with her.</P>
<P>Well, said <HI>Glanville,</HI> excessively shock'd at
this Intelligence, Go to your Lady; I am go∣ing
Home—You may bring me her Message to
my own Apartment.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy</HI> did as she was desir'd; and Mr. <HI>Glan∣ville,</HI>
impatient as he was to unravel the My∣stery,
yet dreading lest his Presence should make
<PB N="273" REF="275"/>
<HI>Arabella</HI> be guilty of some Extravagance before
the Servants who were with her, he follow'd
slowly after her, resolving if possible, to pro∣cure

for whose Sorrow, tho' he suspected it was
owing to some ridiculous Cause, he could not
help being affected.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Not much plainer than the former.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>ARABELLA,</HI> who had walk'd as fast as
her Legs would carry her, got Home
before <HI>Lucy</HI> could overtake her, and retiring to
her Chamber, gave Way to a fresh Burst of
Grief, and bewail'd the Infidelity of <HI>Glanville</HI>
in Terms befitting a <HI>Clelia</HI> or <HI>Mandana.</HI></P>
<P>As soon as she saw <HI>Lucy</HI> enter, she started
from her Chair with great Emotion.</P>
<P>Thou comest, said she, I know, to inter∣cede
for that ungrateful Man, whose Infidelity
I am weak enough to lament: But open not
thy Mouth, I charge thee, in his Defence.</P>
<P>No, indeed, Madam, said <HI>Lucy.</HI></P>
<P>Nor bring me any Account of his Tears, his
Desparation, or his Despair, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> since
questionless he will feign them all to deceive
me.</P>
<P>Here <HI>Glanville,</HI> who had watch'd <HI>Lucy</HI>'s com∣ing,
and had follow'd her into <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Apart∣ment,
appear'd at the Door.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="276"/>
Oh Heav'ns! cry'd <HI>Arabella</HI> lifting up her
fine Eyes, Can it be that this disloyal Man, un∣aw'd
by the Discovery of his Guilt, again pre∣sumes
to approach me!—</P>
<P>Dearest Cousin, said <HI>Glanville,</HI> What is the
Meaning of all this?—How have I disoblig'd
you?—What is my Offence? I beseech you,
tell me.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Enigmatical Way of speaking upon such Occasions, is of great Use in the voluminous <HI>French</HI> Romances; since the Doubt and Confusion it is the Cause of, both to the Accus'd and Accuser, gives Ris<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to a great Number of succeding Mistakes, and consequently Adventures.</NOTE> Ask the inconstant <HI>Ariamenes,</HI> reply'd

The Betrayer of <HI>Cynecia</HI> can best answer
that Question to the Deceiver of <HI>Arabella.</HI> And
the Guilt of the one can only be compar'd to
the Crimes of the other.</P>
<P>Good God! interrupted Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> fret∣ting
excessively, What am I to understand by
all this? On my Soul, Madam, I don't know
the Meaning of one Word you say.</P>
<P>Oh Dissembler! said <HI>Arabella,</HI> Is it thus that
thou would'st impose upon my Credulity? Does
not the Name of <HI>Ariamenes</HI> make thee tremble
then? And can'st thou hear that of <HI>Cynecia</HI>
without Confusion?</P>
<P>Dear Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> said <HI>Glanville</HI> smiling,
What are these Names to me?</P>
<P>False Man, interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> Dost thou
presume to sport with thy Crimes then? Are
not the Treacheries of <HI>Ariamenes</HI> the Crimes of
<HI>Glanville?</HI> Could <HI>Ariamenes</HI> be false to the Prin∣cess
<PB N="275" REF="277"/>
of <HI>Gaul,</HI> and can <HI>Glanville</HI> be innocent to∣wards
<HI>Arabella?</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who had never heard her in
his Opinion, talk so ridiculously before, was so
amaz'd at the incomprehensible Stuff she utter'd
with so much Emotion, that he began to fear
her Intellects were really touch'd. This
Thought gave him a Concern that spread itself
in a Moment over his Countenance. He gaz'd
on her with a fix'd Attention, dreading, yet
wishing she would speak again; equally divided
between his Hopes, that her next Speech would
remove his Suspicion, and his Fears, that it
might more confirm them.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> taking Notice of his pensive Posture,
turn'd away her Head, lest by beholding him,
she should relent, and treat him with less Seve∣rity
than she had intended; making at the same
Time a Sign to him to be gone.</P>
<P>Indeed, Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> said <HI>Glanville</HI> who un∣derstood
her perfectly well, I cannot leave you
in this Temper. I must know how I have
been so unfortunate as to offend you.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> no longer able to contain herself,
burst into Tears at this Question: With one
Hand she made repeated Signs to him to be
gone, with the other she held her Handkerchief
to her Eyes, vex'd and asham'd of her Weak∣ness.</P>
<P>But Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> excessively shock'd at this
Sight, instead of leaving her, threw himself on
his Knees before her, and taking her Hand,
which he tenderly prest to his Lips,</P>
<P>Good God! my dearest Cousin, said he,
How you distract me by this Behaviour! Sure
<PB N="276" REF="278"/>
something extraordinary must be the Matter.
What can it be that thus afflicts you?—Am I
the Cause of these Tears?—Can I have offended
you so much?—Speak, dear Madam—Let me
know my Crime. Yet may I perish if I am
conscious of any towards you—</P>
<P>Disloyal Man, said <HI>Arabella</HI> dis-engaging her
Hand from his, Does then the Crime of <HI>Aria∣menes</HI>
seem so light in thy Apprehension, that
thou can'st hope to be thought innocent by
<HI>Arabella?</HI> No, no, ungrateful Man, the un∣fortunate
<HI>Cynecia</HI> shall have no Cause to say,
that I will triumph in her Spoils. I myself will
be the Minister of her Revenge; and <HI>Glanville</HI>
shall suffer for the Crime of <HI>Ariamenes.</HI></P>
<P>Who the Devil is this <HI>Ariamenes,</HI> cry'd
<HI>Glanville</HI> rising in a Passion? And why am I to
suffer for his Crime, pray? For Heav'ns Sake,
dear Cousin, don't let your Imagination wan∣der
thus. Upon my Soul, I don't believe there
is any such Person as <HI>Ariamenes</HI> in the World,</P>
<P>Vile Equivocator, said <HI>Arabella; Ariamenes,</HI>
tho' dead to <HI>Cynecia,</HI> is alive to the deluded
<HI>Arabella.</HI> The Crimes of <HI>Ariamenes</HI> are the
Guilt of <HI>Glanville:</HI> And if the one has made
himself unworthy of the Princess of <HI>Gaul,</HI> by
his Perfidy and Ingratitude, the other by his
Baseness and Deceit, merits nothing but Con∣tempt
and Detestation from <HI>Arabella.</HI></P>
<P>Frenzy, by my Soul, cry'd <HI>Glanville</HI> mutter∣ingly
between his Teeth: This is downright
Frenzy. What shall I do?—</P>
<P>Hence, from my Presence, resum'd <HI>Arabella,</HI>
false and ungrateful Man; persecute me no
more with the hateful Offers of thy Love. From
<PB N="277" REF="279"/>
this Moment I banish thee from my Thoughts
for ever; and neither as <HI>Glanville</HI> or as <HI>Aria∣menes,</HI>
will I ever behold thee more.</P>
<P>Stay, dear Cousin, said <HI>Glanville</HI> holding her
(for she was endeavouring to rush by him, un∣willing
he should see the Tears that had over∣spread
her Face as she pronounc'd those Words)
hear me, I beg you, but one Word. Who is
it you mean by <HI>Ariamenes?</HI>—Is it me?—Tell
me, Madam, I beseech you—This is some hor∣rid
Mistake—You have been impos'd upon by
some villainous Artifice—Speak, dear Lady
<HI>Bella</HI>—Is it me you mean by <HI>Ariamenes?</HI> For
so your last Words seem'd to hint—</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> without regarding what he said,
struggled violently to force her Hand from his:
and finding him still earnest to detain her, told
him with an enrag'd Voice, That she would
call for Help, if he did not unhand her directly.</P>
<P>Poor <HI>Glanville,</HI> at this Menace, submissively
dropt her Hand; and the Moment she was free,
she flew out of the Room, and locking herself
up in her Closet, sent her Commands to him
by one of her Women, whom she call'd to
her, to leave her Apartment immediately.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Containing indeed no great Matters, but
being a Prelude to greater.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who stood fix'd like a Statue
in the Place where <HI>Arabella</HI> had left him,
was rous'd by this Message, which tho' palliated
<PB N="278" REF="280"/>
a little by the Girl that deliver'd it, who was
not quite so punctual as <HI>Lucy,</HI> nevertheless fill'd
him with extreme Confusion. He obey'd how∣ever
immediately, and retiring to his own Apart∣ment,
endeavour'd to recall to his Memory all
Lady <HI>Bella</HI> had said.</P>
<P>The Ambiguity of her Style, which had led
him into a Suspicion he had never entertain'd
before, her last Words had partly explain'd, if
as he understood she did, she meant him by
<HI>Ariamenes.</HI> Taking this for granted, he easily
conceiv'd some Plot grounded on her Roman∣tick
Notions had been laid, to prepossess her
against him.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George</HI>'s Behaviour to her rush'd that Mo∣ment
into his Thoughts: He instantly recollected
all his Fooleries, his History, his Letter, his
Conversation, all apparently copied from those
Books she was so fond of, and probably done
with a View to some other Design upon her.</P>
<P>These Reflections, join'd to his new awak'd
Suspicions, that he was in Love with her, con∣vinc'd
him he was the Author of their present
Mis-understanding; and that he had impos'd
some new Fallacy upon <HI>Arabella,</HI> in order to
promote a Quarrel between them.</P>
<P>Fir'd almost to Madness at this Thought, he
stamp'd about his Room, vowing Revenge up∣on
Sir <HI>George,</HI> execrating Romances, and curs∣ing
his own Stupidity for not discovering Sir
<HI>George</HI> was his Rival, and knowing his plotting
Talent, not providing against his Artifices.</P>
<P>His first Resolutions were to set out imme∣diately
for Sir <HI>George</HI>'s Seat, and force him to
confess the Part he had acted against him: But a
<PB N="279" REF="281"/>
Moment's Consideration convinc'd him, that
was not the most probable Place to find him in,
since it was much more likely he was waiting
the Success of his Schemes in <HI>London,</HI> or perhaps
at <HI>Richmond.</HI></P>
<P>Next to satiating his Vengeance, the Pleasure
of detecting him in such a Manner, that he
could not possibly deny or palliate his Guilt, was
next his Heart.</P>
<P>He resolv'd therefore to give it out, that he
was gone to <HI>London,</HI> to make Lady <HI>Bella</HI> be∣lieve
it was in Obedience to her Commands
that he had left her, with a Purpose not to re∣turn
till he had clear'd his Innocence; but in
reality to conceal himself in his own Apartment,
and see what Effects his reputed Absence would
produce.</P>
<P>Having thus taken his Resolution, he sent
for Mr. <HI>Roberts</HI> his Father's Steward, to whose
Care he had entrusted Lady <HI>Bella</HI> in her Retire∣ment,
and acquainting him with Part of his
Apprehensions with Regard to Sir <HI>George</HI>'s At∣temp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
upon his Cousin; he imparted to him
his Design of staying conceal'd there, in order
to discover more effectually those Attempts, and
to preserve Lady <HI>Bella</HI> from any Consequence
of them.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Roberts</HI> approv'd of his Design; and as∣sur'd
him of his Vigilance and Care, both in
concealing his Stay, and also in giving him No∣tice
of every Thing that pass'd.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> then wrote a short Billet to
<HI>Arabella,</HI> expressing his Grief for her Displea∣sure,
his Departure in Obedience to her Orders,
and his Resolution not to appear in her Presence,
<PB N="280" REF="282"/>
till he could give her convincing Proofs of his
Innocence.</P>
<P>This Letter he sent by <HI>Roberts,</HI> which <HI>Ara∣bella</HI>
condescended to read, but would return no
Answer.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> then mounting his Horse,
which <HI>Roberts</HI> had order'd to be got ready, rode
away, and leaving him at a House he sometimes
put up at, return'd on Foot, and was let in by
Mr. <HI>Roberts</HI> at the Garden-door, and conducted
unseen to his Chamber.</P>
<P>While he pass'd that Night and great Part of
the next Day, meditating on the Treachery of
Sir <HI>George,</HI> and soothing his Uneasiness with the
Hopes of Revenge, <HI>Arabella,</HI> no less disquieted,
mus'd on the Infidelity of her Lover, the De∣spair
of <HI>Cynecia,</HI> and the Impossibility of her
ever being happy. Then ransacking her Me∣mory
for Instances in her Romances of Ladies
equally unfortunate with herself, she would
sometimes compare herself to one Lady, some∣times
to another, adapting their Sentiments,
and making Use of their Language in her Com∣plaints.</P>
<P>Great Part of the Day being spent in this
Manner, the uneasy Restlessness of her Mind
made her wish to see <HI>Cynecia</HI> again. She long'd
to ask her a hundred Questions about the un∣faithful
<HI>Ariamenes,</HI> which the Suddainess of her
Departure, and her own Astonishment prevented
her from doing, when she made that fatal Dis∣covery,
which had cost her so much Uneasiness.</P>
<P>Sometimes a faint Hope would arise in her
Mind that <HI>Cynecia</HI> might be mistaken, thro' the
great Resemblance that possibly was between
<HI>Ariamenes</HI> and <HI>Glanville.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="283"/>
She remember'd that <HI>Mandana</HI> had been de∣ceiv'd
by the Likeness of <HI>Cyrus</HI> to <HI>Spitridates;</HI>
and concluded that illustrious Prince inconstant,
because <HI>Spitridates,</HI> whom she took for <HI>Cyrus,</HI>
saw her carry'd away, without offering to
rescue her.</P>
<P>Dwelling with Eagerness upon this Thought,
because it afforded her a temporary Relief from
others more tormenting, she resolv'd to go to
the Park, tho' she had but little Hopes of find∣ing
<HI>Cynecia</HI> there; supposing it but too proba∣ble,
that the Disturbance which the Sight, or
fancy'd Sight of <HI>Ariamenes</HI> had given her, would
confine her for some Days to her Chamber.
Yet however small the Probability was of meet∣ing
with her, she could not resist the impatient
Desire she felt of going to seek her.</P>
<P>Dispensing therefore with the Attendance of
any other Servant but <HI>Lucy,</HI> she left her Apart∣ment,
with a Design of resuming her usual
Walk, when she was met at her stepping out of
the Door by Lady <HI>L</HI>—'s three Daughters, (who
had visited her during her Residence at <HI>Richmond)</HI>
and another young Lady.</P>
<P>These Ladies, who to vary the Scene of their
Rural Diversions, were going to cross over to
<HI>Twickenham,</HI> and walk there, prest Lady <HI>Bella</HI>
to accompany them. Our melancholy Heroine
refus'd them at first, but upon their repeated
Importunity, recollecting that the Princess of
<HI>Gaul</HI> had inform'd her she resided there, she
consented to go, in Hopes some favourable
Chance might bring her in their Way, or dis∣cover
the Place of her Retreat, when she could
easily find some Excuse for leaving her Compa∣nions,
and going to her.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="284"/>
Mr. <HI>Roberts,</HI> who according to his Instructi∣ons,
narrowly watch'd <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Motions, find∣ing
she did not command his Attendance as
usual, resolv'd however to be privately of this
Party. He had but just Time to run up and
acquaint Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> and then follow'd the
Ladies at a Distance, who taking Boat, pass'd
over to <HI>Twickenham,</HI> which he also did as soon
as he saw them landed.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Which acquaints the Reader with two very
extraordinary Accidents.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who did not doubt but
<HI>Roberts</HI> would bring him some Intelli∣gence,
sat waiting with anxious Impatience for
his Return. The Evening drew on apace, he
number'd the Hours, and began to grow uneasy
at <HI>Arabella</HI>'s long Stay. His Chamber Win∣dow
looking into the Garden, he thought he
saw his Cousin, cover'd with her Veil as usual,
hasten down one of the Walks; his Heart
leap'd at this transient View, he threw up the
Sash, and looking out, saw her very plainly
strike into a cross Walk, and a Moment after
saw Sir <HI>George,</HI> who came out of a little Sum∣mer-house,
at her Feet. Transported with
Rage at this Sight, he snatch'd up his Sword,
flew down the Stairs into the Garden, and
came running like a Madman up the Walk in
which the Lovers were. The Lady observing
him first, for Sir <HI>George</HI>'s Back was towards
<PB N="283" REF="285"/>
him, shriek'd aloud, and not knowing what
she did, ran towards the House, crying for
Help, and came back as fast, yet not Time
enough to prevent Mischief: For Mr. <HI>Glan∣ville,</HI>
actuated by an irresistible Fury, cry'd out
to Sir <HI>George</HI> to defend himself, who had but
just Time to draw his Sword and make an in∣effectual
Pass at Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> when he receiv'd
his into his Body, and fell to the Ground.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> losing his Resentment insensi∣bly
at the Sight of his Rival's Blood, threw
down his Sword, and endeavour'd to support
him; while the Lady, who had lost her Veil
in her running, and to the great Astonishment
of Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> prov'd to be his Sister, came
up to them, with Tears and Exclamations,
blaming herself for all that had happen'd.
Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> with a Heart throbbing with Re∣morse
for what he had done, gaz'd on his Sister
with an accusing Look, as she hung over the
wounded Baronet with streaming Eyes, some∣times
wringing her Hands, then clasping them
together in an Agony of Grief.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George</HI> having Strength enough left to
observe her Disorder, and the generous Concern
of <HI>Glanville,</HI> who holding him in his Arms,
intreated his Sister to send for proper Assistance,
Dear <HI>Charles,</HI> said he, you are too kind, I
have us'd you very ill, I have deserv'd my
Death from your Hand—You know not what
I have been base enough to practise against you—
If I can but live to clear your Innocence to
Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> and free you from the Consequen∣ces
of this Action, I shall die satisfy'd—</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="286"/>
His Strength failing him at these Words, he
fainted away in Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>'s Arms; who tho'
now convinc'd of his Treachery, was extremely
shock'd at the Condition he saw him in.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> renewing her Tears and Ex∣clamations
at this Sight, he was oblig'd to lay
Sir <HI>George</HI> gently upon the Ground, and ran to
find out somebody to send for a Surgeon, and
to help him to convey him into the House.</P>
<P>In his Way he was met by Mr. <HI>Roberts,</HI> who
was coming to seek him; and with a Look of
Terror and Confusion told him, Lady <HI>Bella</HI>
was brought Home extremely ill—that her Life
had been in Danger, and that she was but just
recover'd from a terrible fainting Fit.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> tho' greatly alarm'd at this
News, forgot not to take all possible Care of
Sir <HI>George;</HI> directing <HI>Roberts</HI> to get some Per∣son
to carry him into the House, and giving
him Orders to procure proper Assistance, flew
to Lady <HI>Bella</HI>'s Apartment.</P>
<P>Her Women had just put her to Bed, raving
as in a strong Delirium. Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> ap∣proach'd
her, and finding she was in a violent
Fever, dispatch'd a Man and Horse immedi∣ately
to Town, to get Physicians, and to ac∣quaint
his Father with what had happen'd.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Roberts,</HI> upon the Surgeon's Report that
Sir <HI>George</HI> was not mortally wounded, came
to inform him of this good News, but he sound
him incapable of listning to him, and in Ago∣nies
not to be exprest. 'Twas with Difficulty
they forc'd him out of <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Chamber into
his own; where throwing himself upon his
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, he refus'd to see or speak to any Body, till
<PB N="285" REF="287"/>
he was told Sir <HI>Charles</HI> and the Physicians were
arriv'd.</P>
<P>He then ran eagerly to hear their Opinions of
his beloved Cousin, which he soon discover'd
by their significant Gestures and half pronounc'd
Words, to be very bad. They comforted him
however, with Hopes that she might recover,
and insisting upon her being kept very quiet,
oblig'd him to quit the Room. While all the
necessary Methods were taken to abate the Vio∣lence
of the Disease, Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> who had been
inform'd by his Steward of his Son's Duel with
Sir <HI>George,</HI> was amaz'd to the last Degree at
two such terrible Accidents.</P>
<P>Having seen his Son to his Chamber, and re∣commended
him to be patient and compos'd,
he went to visit the young Baronet, and was
not a little surpriz'd to find his Daughter sitting
at his Bed's Head, with all the Appearance of
a violent Affliction.</P>
<P>Indeed Miss <HI>Glanville</HI>'s Cares were so wholly
engross'd by Sir <HI>George</HI>'s, that she hardly
ever thought of her Cousin <HI>Arabella,</HI> and had
just stept into her Chamber while the Surgeons
were dressing Sir <HI>George</HI>'s Wound, and renew'd
her Attendance upon him as soon as that was
over.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> however, thought proper to
make some trifling Excuses to her Father for
her Solicitude about Sir <HI>George.</HI> And the
young Baronet, on whom the Fear of Death
produc'd its usual Effects, and made him ex∣tremely
concern'd for the Errors of his past
Life, and very desirous of attoning for them if
possible, assur'd Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> that if he liv'd he
<PB N="286" REF="288"/>
would offer himself to his Acceptance for a Son-in-law;
declaring that he had basely trifled
with the Esteem of his Daughter, but that she
had wholly subdued him to herself by her for∣giving
Tenderness.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles</HI> was very desirous of knowing the
Occasion of his Quarrel with his Son, but Sir
<HI>George</HI> was too weak to hold any further Con∣versation,
upon which Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> after a short
Visit retir'd, taking Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> along with
him.</P>
<P>That the Reader, whose Imagination is no
doubt upon the Stretch to conceive the Meaning
of these Two extraordinary Incidents, may be

<P><PB N="287" REF="289"/>
<HI>Arabella</HI> was so disgusted with this (as she
thought) insipid Discourse, which gave no Re∣lief
to the Anxiety of her Mind, but added a
Kind of Fretfulness and Impatience to her
Grief; that she resolv'd to quit them, and with
<HI>Lucy,</HI> go in quest of the Princess of <HI>Gaul</HI>'s
Retreat.</P>
<P>The Ladies however, insisted upon her not
leaving them; and her Excuse that she was
going in search of an unfortunate Unknown,
for whom she had vow'd a Friendship, made
them all immediately resolve to accompany her,
extremely diverted with the Oddity of the De∣sign,
and sacrificing her to their Mirth by sly
Leers, Whispers, stifled Laughs, and a thou∣sand
little sprightly Sallies, which the disconso∣late
<HI>Arabella</HI> took no Notice of, so deeply were
her Thoughts engag'd.</P>
<P>Tho' she knew not which Way to direct her
Steps, yet concluding the melancholy <HI>Cynccia</HI>
would certainly chuse some very solitary Place
for her Residence, she rambled about among
the least frequented Paths, follow'd by the young
Ladies, who ardently desir'd to see this unfor∣tunate
Unknown; tho' at <HI>Arabella</HI>'s earnest
Request, they promis'd not to shew themselves
to the Lady, who, she inform'd them, for
very urgent Reasons, was oblig'd to keep herself
conceal'd.</P>
<P>Fatiguing as this Ramble was to the delicate
Spirits of <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Companions, they were en∣abled
to support it by the Diversion her Beha∣viour
afforded them.</P>
<P>Every Peasant she met, she enquir'd if a Beau∣tiful
Lady disguis'd did not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
thereabout.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="290"/>
To some she gave a Description of her Per∣son,
to others an Account of the Domesticks
that were with her; not forgetting her Dress,
her Melancholy, and the great Care she took
to keep herself conceal'd.</P>
<P>These strange Enquiries, with the strange
Language in which they were made, not a lit∣tle
surpriz'd the good People to whom she ad∣dress'd
herself, yet mov'd to Respect by the ma∣jestick
Loveliness of her Person, they answer'd
her in the Negative, without any Mixture of
Scoff and Impertinence.</P>
<P>How unfavourable is Chance, said <HI>Arabella</HI>
fretting at the Disappointment, to Persons who
have any Reliance upon it! This Lady that I
have been in Search of so long without Success,
may probably be found by others who do not
seek her, whose Presence she may wish to
avoid, yet not be able.</P>
<P>The young Ladies finding it grew late, ex∣press'd
their Apprehensions at being without any
Attendants; and desir'd <HI>Arabella</HI> to give over
her Search for that Day. <HI>Arabella</HI> at this Hint
of Danger, enquir'd very earnestly, If they ap∣prehended
any Attempts to carry them away?
And without staying for an Answer, urg'd them
to walk Home as fast as possible, apologizing
for the Danger into which she had so indiscreet∣ly
drawn both them and herself; yet added her
Hopes, that if any Attempt should be made
upon their Liberty, some generous Cavalier
would pass by who would rescue them: A Thing
so common, that they had no Reason to de∣spair
of it.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="291"/>
<HI>Arabella</HI> construing the Silence with which
her Companions heard these Assurances, into a
Doubt of their being so favoured by Fortune,
proceeded to inform them of several Instances
wherein Ladies met with unexpected Relief and
Deliverance from Ravishers.</P>
<P>She mention'd particularly the Rescue of
<HI>Statira</HI> by her own Brother, whom she ima∣gin'd
for many Years dead; that of the Prin∣cess
<HI>Berenice</HI> by an absolute Stranger, and many
others, whose Names, Characters and Adven∣tures
she occasionally run over; all which the
young Ladies heard with inconceivable Asto∣nishment.
And the Detail had such an Effect
upon <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Imagination, bewilder'd as i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
was in the Folies of Romances, that 'spying
three or four Horsemen riding along the Road
towards them, she immediately concluded they
would be all seiz'd and carry'd off.</P>
<P>Possess'd with this Belief, she utter'd a loud
Cry, and flew to the Water-side, which alarm∣ing
the Ladies, who could not imagine what
was the Matter, they ran after her as fast as
possible.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> stop'd when she came to the Water∣side,
and looking round about, and not perceiv∣ing
any Boat to waft them over to <HI>Richmond,</HI> a
Thought suddenly darted into her Mind, wor∣thy
those ingenious Books which gave it Birth.</P>
<P>Turning therefore to the Ladies, who all at
once were enquiring the Cause of her Fright;</P>
<P>'Tis now, my fair Companions, said she,
with a solemn Accent, that the Destinies have
<PB N="290" REF="292"/>
furnish'd you with an Opportunity of display∣ing
in a Manner truly Heroick, the Sublimity
of your Virtue, and the Grandeur of your
Courage to the World.</P>
<P>The Action we have it in our Power to per∣form
will immortalize our Fame, and raise us
to a Pitch of Glory equal to that of the re∣nown'd
<HI>Clelia</HI> herself.</P>
<P>Like her, we may expect Statues erected to
our Honour: Like her, be propos'd as Patterns
to Heroines in ensuing Ages: And like her,
perhaps, meet with Sceptres and Crowns for
our Reward.</P>
<P>What that beauteous <HI>Roman</HI> Lady perform'd
to preserve herself from Violation by the impi∣ous
<HI>Sextus,</HI> let us imitate to avoid the Violence
our intended Ravishers yonder come to offer us.</P>
<P>Fortune, which has thrown us into this Exi∣gence,
presents us the Means of gloriously
escaping: And the Admiration and Esteem of
all Ages to come, will be the Recompence of
our noble Daring.</P>
<P>Once more, my fair Companions, If your
Honour be dear to you, if an immortal Glory
be worth your seeking, follow the Exam∣ple
I shall set you, and equal with me the <HI>Ro∣man
Clelia.</HI></P>
<P>Saying this, she plung'd into the <HI>Thames,</HI> in∣tending
to swim over it, as <HI>Clelia</HI> did the <HI>Tyber.</HI></P>
<P>The young Ladies, who had listen'd with
silent Astonishment at the long Speech she had
made them, the Purport of which not one of
them understood, scream'd out aloud at this
<PB N="291" REF="293"/>
horrid Spectacle, and wringing their Hands,
ran backwards and forwards like distracted Per∣sons,
crying for Help. <HI>Lucy</HI> tore her Hair,
and was in the utmost Agony of Grief, when
Mr. <HI>Roberts,</HI> who, as we have said before, kept
them always in Sight, having observ'd <HI>Arabella</HI>
running towards the Water-side, follow'd them
as fast as he could, and came Time enough up
to see her frantick Action. Jumping into the
River immediately after her, he caught hold of
her Gown, and drew her after him to the Shore.
A Boat that Instant appearing, he put her into
it, senseless, and to all Appearance dead. He
and <HI>Lucy</HI> supporting her, they were wasted over
in a few Moments to the other Side: Her House
being near the River, Mr. <HI>Roberts</HI> carry'd her
in his Arms to it; and as soon as he saw her
shew Signs of returning Life, left her to the
Care of the Women, who made haste to put
her into a warm Bed, and ran to find out
Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> as we have related.</P>
<P>There remains now only to account for
Sir <HI>George</HI> and Miss <HI>Glanville</HI>'s sudden Appear∣ance,
which happen'd, gentle Reader, exactly
as follows.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> having set out pretty late in
the Afternoon, with a Design of staying all
Night at <HI>Richmond,</HI> as her Chaise drove up
<HI>Kew-Lane,</HI> saw one of her Cousin's Women,
<HI>Deborah</HI> by Name, talking to a Gentleman,
whom, notwithstanding the Disguise of a Horse∣man's
Coat, and a Hat slouch'd over his Face,
she knew to be Sir <HI>George Bellmour.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="294"/>
This Sight alarming her Jealousy, and re∣newing
all her former Suspicions, that her Cou∣sin's
Charms rival'd hers in his Heart, as soon
as she alighted, finding <HI>Arabella</HI> was not at
Home, she retir'd in great Anguish of Mind to
her Chamber, revolving in her Mind every
Particular of Sir <HI>George</HI>'s Behaviour to her Cou∣sin
in the Country, and finding new Cause for
Suspicion in every Thing she recollected, and
reflecting upon the Disguise in which she saw
him, and his Conference with her Woman, she
concluded herself had all along been the Dupe
of his Artifice, and her Cousin the real Object
of his Love.</P>
<P>This Thought throwing her into an Extre∣mity
of Rage, all her tenderest Emotions were
lost in the Desire of Revenge. She imagin'd
to herself so much Pleasure from exposing his
Treachery, and putting it our of his Power to
deny it, that she resolv'd, whatever it cost her,
to have that Satisfaction.</P>
<P>Supposing therefore <HI>Deborah</HI> was now re∣turn'd,
she rung her Bell, and commanded her
Attendance on her in her Chamber.</P>
<P>The Stern Brow with which she receiv'd
her, frighten'd the Girl, conscious of her Guilt,
into a Disposition to confess all, even before she
was tax'd with any thing.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> saw her Terror, and endea∣vour'd
to heighten it, by entering at once into
Complaints and Exclamations against her,
threatning to acquaint her Father with her Plots
to betray her Lady, and assuring her of a very
severe Punishment for her Treachery.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="295"/>
The Girl, terrify'd extremely at these Me∣naces,
begg'd Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> with Tears, to
forgive her, and not to acquaint Sir <HI>Charles</HI> or
her Lady, with her Fault; adding, that she
would confess all, and never while she liv'd, do
such a Thing again.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> would make her no Promises,
but urg'd her to confess: Upon which <HI>Deborah</HI>
sobbing, own'd, That for the Sake of the Pre∣sents
Sir <HI>George</HI> had made her, she consented to
meet him privately from Time to Time, and
give him an Account of every Thing that
pass'd with Regard to her Lady; not thinking
there was any Harm in it. That according to
his Desires, she had constantly acquainted him
with all her Lady's Motions, when, and where
she went, how she and Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> agreed,
and a hundred other Things which he enquir'd
about. That that Day in particular, he had
intreated her to procure him the M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ans of an
Interview with her Lady, if possible; and un∣derstanding
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> was not at <HI>Richmond,</HI>
she had let him privately into the Garden,
where she hop'd to prevail upon her Lady
to go.</P>
<P>What, said Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> surpriz'd, Is Sir
<HI>George</HI> waiting for my Cousin in the Garden
then?</P>
<P>Yes, indeed, Madam, said <HI>Deborah:</HI> But
I'll go and tell him to wait no longer; and
never speak to him again, if your Ladyship
will but be pleas'd to forgive me.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> having taken her Resolution,
not only promis'd <HI>Deborah</HI> her Pardon, but also
<PB N="294" REF="296"/>
a Reward, provided she would contrive it so,
that she might meet Sir <HI>George</HI> instead of her
Cousin.</P>
<P>The Girl, having the true Chamber-Maid
Spirit of Intrigue in her, immediately propos'd
her putting on one of her Lady's Veils; which
as it was now the Close of the Evening, would
disguise her sufficiently; to which Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI>
transported with the Thoughts of thus having
an Opportunity of convincing Sir <HI>George</HI> of his
Perfidy, and reproaching him for it, consented,
and bid her bring it without being observ'd, into
her Chamber.</P>
<P><HI>Deborah</HI> informing her, that Sir <HI>George</HI> was
conceal'd in the Summer-House, as soon as she
had equipp'd herself with <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Veil she
went into the Walk that led to it; and Sir <HI>George,</HI>
believing her to be that Lady, hasten'd to throw
himself at her Feet, and had scarce got through
half a Speech he had study'd for his present
Purpose, when Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> gave a fatal In∣terruption
to his Heroicks, in the Manner we
have already related.</P>

<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A short Chapter indeed, but full of Matter.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>RICHMOND</HI> was now a Scene of the ut∣most
Confusion and Distress. <HI>Arabella</HI>'s
Fever was risen to such a Height, that she was
<PB N="295" REF="297"/>
given over by the Physicians; and Sir <HI>George</HI>'s
Wounds, tho' not judg'd mortal at first, yet by
the great Effusion of Blood had left him in so
weak a Condition, that he was thought to be
in great Danger.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> almost distracted with the Fears
of the Consequences of Sir <HI>George</HI>'s Death, in∣treated
his Son to quit the Kingdom; but
Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> protesting he would rather die
than leave <HI>Arabella</HI> in that Illness, he was
oblig'd to give Bail for his Appearance, in Case
Sir <HI>George</HI> dy'd: This Affair, notwithstanding
all Endeavours to prevent it, having made a
great Noise.</P>
<P>Poor Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> opprest as he was with the
Weight of all these Calamities, was yet oblig'd
to labour incessantly to keep up the Spirits of
his Son and Daughter. The settled Despair of
the one, and the silent swelling Grief of the
other, cut him to the Heart. He omitted no
Arguments his Paternal Affection suggested to
him, to moderate their Affliction. Mr. <HI>Glan∣ville</HI>
often endeavour'd to assume a Composure
he was very far from feeling, in order to satisfy
his Father. But Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> looking upon
herself to be the Cause of Sir <HI>George</HI>'s Misfor∣tune,
declar'd, She should be miserable all her
Life, if he died.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> in her lucid Intervals, being sensible
of her Danger, prepar'd for Death, with great
Piety and Constancy of Mind, having solemnly
assur'd Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> of her Forgiveness, who
would not at that Time enter into an Explana∣tion
<PB N="296" REF="298"/>
of the Affair which had given her Offence
for fear of perplexing her. She permitted his
Presence often in her Chamber, and desir'd with
great Earnestness the Assistance of some worthy
Divine in her Preparations for Death. The
Pious and Learned Doctor—at Sir <HI>Charles</HI>'s
Intimation of his Niece's Desire, came con∣stantly
twice a Day to attend her. Her Fever,
by a favourable Crisis, and the great Skill of her
Physicians, left her in a Fortnight; but this
violent Distemper had made such a Ravage in
her delicate Constitution, and reduc'd her so low
that there seem'd very little Probability of her
Recovery. Doctor—, in whom her un∣feign'd
Piety, her uncommon Firmness of Mind,
had created a great Esteem and Tenderness for
her, took all Opportunities of comforting, ex∣horting,
and praying by her. The Occasion of
her Illness being the Subject of every body's
Conversation at <HI>Richmond,</HI> he gently hinted it
to her, and urg'd her to explain her Reasons for
so extravagant an Action.</P>
<P>In the Divine Frame <HI>Arabella</HI> was then in,
this Action appear'd to her rash and vain-glori∣ous,
and she acknowledg'd it to be so to her
pious Monitor: Yet she related the Motives
which induc'd her to it, the Danger she was in
of being carry'd away, the Parity of her Cir∣cumstances
then with <HI>Clelia,</HI> and her emulous
Desire of doing as much to preserve her Ho∣nour
as that renown'd <HI>Roman</HI> Lady did for
hers.</P>
<P>The good Doctor was extremely surpriz'd at
this Discourse: He was beginning to think her
<PB N="297" REF="299"/>
again delirious; but <HI>Arabella</HI> added to this Ac∣count
such sensible Reasoning on the Nature
of that Fondness for Fame, which prompted
her to so rash an Undertaking, that the Doctor
left her in strange Embarrassment, not knowing
how to account for a Mind at once so enlight∣en'd,
and so ridiculous.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> meeting him as he came out
of her Chamber, the Doctor took this Oppor∣tunity
to acknowledge the Difficulties <HI>Arabella</HI>'s
inconsistent Discourse had thrown him into.
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> taking him into his own Apart∣ment,
explain'd the Nature of that seeming
Inconsistency, and expatiated at large upon the
Disorders Romances had occasion'd in her Ima∣gination;
several Instances of which he re∣counted,
and fill'd the Doctor with the greatest
Astonishment and Concern. He lamented pa∣thetically
the Ruin such a ridiculous Study had
brought on so noble a Mind; and assur'd Mr.
<HI>Glanville,</HI> he would spare no Endeavours to rescue
it from so shocking a Delusion.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> thank'd him for his good De∣sign,
with a Transport which his Fears of his
Cousin's Danger almost mingled with Tears;
and the Doctor and he agreed to expect for some
few Days longer an Alteration for the better in
the Health of her Body, before he attempted
the Cure of her Mind. Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>'s extreme
Anxiety had made him in Appearance neglect
the repentant Sir <HI>George,</HI> contenting himself
with constantly sending twice a Day to enquire
after his Health, but had not yet visited him.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="300"/>
No sooner had the Physicians declared that
<HI>Arabella</HI> was no longer in Danger, than his
Mind being freed from that tormenting Load
of Suspence under which it had labour'd while
her Recovery was yet doubful, he went to
Sir <HI>George</HI>'s Chamber, who by reason of his
Weakness, tho' he was also upon the Recovery,
still kept his Bed.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George,</HI> tho' he ardently wish'd to see him,
yet conscious of the Injuries he had both done
and design'd him, could not receive his Visit
without extreme Confusion: But entering into
the Cause of their Quarrel, as soon as he was
able to speak, he freely acknowledg'd his Fault,
and all the Steps he had taken to supplant him
in <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Affection.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> understanding by this Means,
that he had brib'd a young Actress to personate
a Princess forsaken by him; and had taught her
all that Heap of Absurdity with which she had
impos'd upon <HI>Arabella,</HI> as has been related, desir'd
only by Way of Reparation, That when his
Cousin was in a Condition to be spoken to upon
that Subject, he would condescend to own the
Fraud to her; which Sir <HI>George</HI> faithfully pro∣mising,
an Act of Oblivion pass'd on Mr.
<HI>Glanville</HI>'s Side for all former Injuries, and a so∣lemn
Assurance from Sir <HI>George</HI> of inviolable
Friendship for the future. An Assurance, how∣ever,
which Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> would willingly have
dispens'd with: For tho' not of a vindictive
Temper, it was one of his Maxims, That a
Man who had once betray'd him, it would be
an Error in Policy ever to trust again.</P>

<PB N="299" REF="301"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Being in the Author's Opinion, the best
Chapter in this History.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE good Divine, who had the Cure of
<HI>Arabella</HI>'s Mind greatly at Heart, no
sooner perceiv'd that the Health of her Body was
almost restor'd, and that he might talk to her
without the Fear of any Inconvenience, than
he introduc'd the Subject of her throwing her∣self
into the River, which he had before lightly
touch'd upon, and still declar'd himself dissatis∣fy'd
with.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> now more dispos'd to defend this
Point than when languishing under the Pressure
of Pain and Dejection of Mind, endeavour'd
by Arguments founded upon Romantick Hero∣ism,
to prove, That it was not only reasonable
and just, but also great and glorious, and exactly
conformable to the Rules of Heroick Virtue.</P>
<P>The Doctor listen'd to her with a mix'd
Emotion, between Pity, Reverence, and Amaze∣ment:
And tho' in the Performance of his Of∣fice
he had been accustom'd to accommodate
his Notions to every Understanding, and had
therefore accumulated a great Variety of To∣picks
and Illustrations; yet he found himself
now engag'd in a Controversy for which he was
not so well prepar'd as he imagin'd, and was at
<PB N="300" REF="302"/>
a Loss for some leading Principle, by which he
might introduce his Reasonings, and begin his
Confutation.</P>
<P>Tho' he saw much to praise in her Discourse,
he was afraid of confirming her Obstinacy by
Commendation: And tho' he also found much
to blame, he dreaded to give Pain to a Delicacy
he rever'd.</P>
<P>Perceiving however, that <HI>Arabella</HI> was silent,
as if expecting his Reply, he resolv'd not to
bring upon himself the Guilt of abandoning her
to her Mistake, and the Necessity of speaking
forc'd him to find something to say.</P>
<P>Tho' it is not easy, Madam, said he, for any
one that has the Honour of conversing with
your Ladyship to preserve his Attention free to
any other Idea, than such as your Discourse
tends immediately to impress, yet I have not
been able while you was speaking, to refrain
from some very mortifying Reflections on the
Imperfection of all human Happiness, and the
uncertain Consequences of all those Advantages
which we think ourselves not only at Liberty
to desire, but oblig'd to cultivate.</P>
<P>Tho' I have known some Dangers and Di∣stresses,
reply'd <HI>Arabella</HI> gravely, yet I did not
imagine myself such a Mirror of Calamity as
could not be seen without Concern. If my Life
has not been eminently fortunate, it has yet
escap'd the great Evils of Persecution, Captivity,
Shipwrecks and Dangers to which many Ladies
far more Illustrious both by Birth and Merit
than myself, have been expos'd. And indeed,
<PB N="301" REF="303"/>
tho' I have sometimes rais'd Envy, or possibly
incurr'd Hatred, yet I have no Reason to believe
I was ever beheld with Pity before.</P>
<P>The Doctor saw he had not introduc'd his
Discourse in the most acceptable Manner; but
it was too late to repent.</P>
<P>Let me not, Madam, said he, be censur'd
before I have fully explain'd my Sentiments.</P>
<P>That you have been envy'd, I can readily
believe: For who that gives Way to natural
Passions has not Reason to envy the Lady <HI>Ara∣bella?</HI>
But that you have been hated, I am in∣deed
less willing to think, tho' I know how ea∣sily
the greater Part of Mankind hate those by
whom they are excell'd.</P>
<P>If the Misery of my Condition, reply'd
<HI>Arabella,</HI> has been able to excite that Melan∣choly
your first. Words seem'd to imply, Flat∣tery
will contribute very little towards the Im∣provement
of it. Nor do I expect from the
Severity of the Sacerdotal Character, any of
those Praises, which I hear perhaps with too
much Pleasure, from the rest of the World.</P>
<P>Having been so lately on the Brink of that
State, in which all Distinctions but that of Good∣ness
are destroy'd, I have not recover'd so much
Laevity, but that I would yet rather hear In∣structions
than Compliments.</P>
<P>If therefore you have observ'd in me any
dangerous Tenets, corrupt Passions, or crimi∣nal
Desires, I conjure you discover me to my∣self.
Let no false Civility restrain your Admo∣nitions.
Let me know this Evil which can
<PB N="302" REF="304"/>
strike a good Man with Horror, and which I
dread the more, as I do not feel it.</P>
<P>I cannot suppose that a Man of your Order
would be alarm'd at any other Misery than Guilt:
Nor will I think so meanly of him whose Di∣rection
I have intreated, as to imagine he can
think Virtue unhappy, however overwhelm'd
by Disasters or Oppression.</P>
<P>Keep me therefore no longer in Suspence: I
expect you will exert the Authority of your
Function, and I promise you on my Part, Sin∣cerity
and Submission.</P>
<P>The good Man was now compleatly embar∣rass'd;
he saw his Meaning mistaken, but was
afraid to explain it, left he should seem to pay
Court by a cowardly Retraction: He therefore
paus'd a little, and <HI>Arabella</HI> supposed he was
studying for such Expressions as might convey
Censure without Offence.</P>
<P>Sir, said she, if you are not yet satisfy'd of
my Willingness to hear your Reproofs, let me
evince my Docility, by intreating you to con∣sider
yourself as dispens'd from all Ceremony
upon this Occasion.</P>
<P>Your Imaginations, Madam, reply'd the
Doctor, are too quick for Language; you con∣jecture
too soon, what you do not wait to
hear; and reason upon Suppositions which can∣not
be allow'd you.</P>
<P>When I mention'd my Reflections upon hu∣man
Misery, I was far from concluding your
Ladyship miserable, compar'd with the rest of
Mankind; and though contemplating the ab∣stracted
<PB N="303" REF="305"/>
Idea of possible Felicity, I thought that
even You might be produc'd as an Instance that
it is not attainable in this World, I did not
impute the Imperfection of your State to
Wickedness, but intended to observe, That
though even Virtue be added to external Ad∣vantages,
there will yet be something wanting
to Happiness.</P>
<P>Whoever sees you, Madam, will immedi∣ately
say, That nothing can hinder you from
being the happiest of Mortals, but Want of
Power to understand your own Advantages.
And whoever is admitted to your Conversation,
will be convinc'd that you enjoy all that Intel∣lectual
Excellence can confer; yet I see you
harrass'd with innumerable Terrors and Per∣plexities,
which never disturb the Peace of Po∣verty
of Ignorance.</P>
<P>I cannot discover, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> how Po∣verty
or Ignorance can be privileg'd from Ca∣sualty
or Violence, from the Ravisher, the
Robber, or the Enemy. I should hope rather
that if Wealth and Knowledge can give no∣thing
else, they at least confer Judgment to
foresee Danger, and Power to oppose it.</P>
<P>They are not indeed, return'd the Doctor,
secur'd against real Misfortunes, but they are
happily defended from wild Imaginations:
They do not suspect what cannot happen, nor
figure Ravishers at a Distance, and leap into
Rivers to escape them.</P>
<P>Do you suppose then, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> that I
was frighted without Cause?</P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="306"/>
It is certain, Madam, reply'd he, that no
Injury was intended you.</P>
<P>Disingennuity, Sir, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> does not
become a Clergyman—I think too well of your
Understanding to imagine your Fallacy de∣ceives
yourself: Why then should you hope that
it will deceive me?</P>
<P>The Laws of Conference require that the
Terms of the Question and Answer be the
same.</P>
<P>I ask, if I had not Cause to be frighted?
Why then am I answer'd that no Injury was
intended?</P>
<P>Human Beings cannot penetrate Intentions,
nor regulate their Conduct but by exterior
Appearances. And surely there was sufficient
Appearance of intended Injury, and that the
greatest which my Sex can suffer.</P>
<P>Why, Madam, said the Doctor, should you
still persist in so wild an Assertion?</P>
<P>A coarse Epithet, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> is no
Confutation. It rests upon you to shew, That
in giving Way to my Fears, even supposing
them groundless, I departed from the Character
of a reasonable Person.</P>
<P>I am afraid, replied the Doctor, of a Di∣spute
with your Ladyship, not because I
think myself in Danger of Defeat, but be∣cause
being accustom'd to speak to Scholars
with Scholastick Ruggedness, I may perhaps
depart in the Heat of Argument, from that
Respect to which you have so great a Right,
and give Offence to a Person I am really
afraid to displease.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="307"/>
But, if you will promise to excuse my
Ardour, I will endeavour to prove that you
have been frighted without Reason.</P>
<P>I should be content, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> to
obtain Truth upon harder Terms, and there∣fore
intreat you to begin.</P>
<P>The Apprehension of any future Evil, Ma∣dam,
said the Divine, which is called Ter∣ror,
when the Danger is from natural Causes,
and Suspicion, when it proceeds from a mo∣ral
Agent, must always arise from Compa∣rison.</P>
<P>We can judge of the Future only by the
Past, and have therefore only Reason to fear
or suspect, when we see the same Causes in
Motion which have formerly produc'd Mis∣chief,
or the same Measures taken as have
before been preparatory to a Crime.</P>
<P>Thus, when the Sailor in certain Lati∣tudes
sees the Clouds rise, Experience bids
him expect a Storm. When any Monarch
levies Armies, his Neighbours prepare to re∣pel
an Invasion.</P>
<P>This Power of Prognostication, may, by
Reading and Conversation, be extended be∣yond
our own Knowledge: And the great
Use of Books, is that of participating without
Labour or Hazard the Experience of others.</P>
<P>But upon this Principle how can you find
any Reason for your late Fright.</P>
<P>Has it ever been known, that a Lady of
your Rank was attack'd with such Inten∣tions,
in a Place so publick, without any
<PB N="306" REF="308"/>
Preparations made by the Violator for Defence
or Escape?</P>
<P>Can it be imagin'd that any Man would
so rashly expose himself to Infamy by Failure,
and to the Gibbet by Success?</P>
<P>Does there in the Records of the World
appear a single Instance of such hopeless Vil∣lany?</P>
<P>It is now Time, Sir, said <HI>Arabella,,</HI> to an∣swer
your Questions, before they are too many
to be remembered.</P>
<P>The Dignity of my Birth can very little
defend me against an Insult to which the
Heiresses of great and powerful Empires,
the Daughters of valiant Princes, and the
Wives of renowned Monarchs, have been a
thousand Times exposed.</P>
<P>The Danger which you think so great,
would hardly repel a determin'd Mind; for in
Effect, Who would have attempted my Re∣scue,
seeing that no Knight or valiant Ca∣valier
was within View?</P>
<P>What then should have hinder'd him from
placing me in a Chariot? Driving it into
the pathless Desart? And immuring me in
a Castle, among Woods and Mountains?
Or hiding me perhaps in the Caverns of a
Rock? Or confining me in some Island of
an immense Lake?</P>
<P>From all this, Madam, interrupted the
Clergyman, he is hinder'd by Impossibility.</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="309"/>
He cannot carry you to any of these dread∣ful
Places, because there is no such Castle,
Desart, Cavern, or Lake.</P>
<P>You will pardon me, Sir, said <HI>Arabella,</HI>
it I recur to your own Principles:</P>
<P>You allow that Experience may be gain'd
by Books: And certainly there is no Part
of Knowledge in which we are oblig'd to
trust them more than in Descriptive Geo∣graphy.</P>
<P>The most restless Activity in the longest
Life, can survey but a small Part of the
habitable Globe: And the rest can only be
known from the Report of others.</P>
<P>Universal Negatives are seldom safe, and
are least to be allow'd when the Disputes
are about Objects of Sense; where one Po∣sition
cannot be inferr'd from another.</P>
<P>That there is a Castle, any Man who
has seen it may safely affirm. But you can∣not
with equal Reason, maintain that there
is no Castle, because you have not seen it.</P>
<P>Why should I imagine that the Face of
the Earth is alter'd since the Time of those
Heroines, who experienc'd so many Changes
of uncouth Captivity?</P>
<P>Castles indeed, are the Works of Art;
and are therefore subject to Decay. But
Lakes, and Caverns, and Desarts, must always
remain.</P>
<P>And why, since you call for Instances, should
I not dread the Misfortunes which happen'd
<PB N="308" REF="310"/>
to the divine <HI>Clelia,</HI> who was carry'd to one
of the Isles of the <HI>Thrasymenian</HI> Lake?</P>
<P>Or those which befel the beautiful <HI>Candace,</HI>
Queen of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> whom the Pyrate <HI>Zeno∣donus</HI>
wander'd with on the Seas?</P>
<P>Or the Accidents which imbitter'd the Life
of the incomparable <HI>Cleopatra?</HI></P>
<P>Or the Persecutions which made that of the
fair <HI>Elisa</HI> miserable?</P>
<P>Or, in fine, the various Distresses of many
other fair and virtuous Princesses: Such as
those which happen'd to <HI>Olympia, Bellamira,
Parisatis, Berenice, Amalagantha, Agione, Al∣bysinda,
Placidia, A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sinoe, Deidamia,</HI> and a
thousand others I could mention.</P>
<P>To the Names of many of these illustrious
Sufferers I am an absolute Stranger, replied the
Doctor.</P>
<P>The rest I saintly remember some Mention
of in those contemptible Volumes, with which
Children are sometimes injudiciously suffer'd
to amuse their Imaginations; but which I
little expected to hear quoted by your Ladyship
in a serious Discourse.</P>
<P>And though I am very far from catching
Occasions of Resentment, yet I think myself
at Liberty to observe, That if I merited your
Censure for one indelicate Epithet, we have
engag'd on very unequal Terms, if I may
not likewise complain of such contemptuous
Ridicule as you are pleas'd to exercise upon
my Opinions by opposing them with the Au∣thority
of Scribblers, not only of Fictions,
<PB N="309" REF="311"/>
but of senseless Fictions; which at once vi∣tiate
the Mind, and pervert the Unstander∣standing;
and which if they are at any Time
read with Safety, owe their Innocence only to
their Absurdity.</P>
<P>From these Books, Sir, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> which
you condemn with so much Ardour, though
you acknowledge yourself little acquainted
with them, I have learnt not to recede from
the Conditions I have granted, and shall not
therefore censure the Licence of your Lan∣guage,
which glances from the Books upon the
Readers.</P>
<P>These Books, Sir, thus corrupt, thus ob∣surd,
thus dangerous alike to the Intellect
and Morals, I have read; and that I hope
without Injury to my Judgment, or my Vir∣tue.</P>
<P>The Doctor, whose Vehemence had hin∣der'd
him from discovering all the Consequen∣ces
of his Position, now found himself entan∣gled,
and reply'd in a submissive Tone,</P>
<P>I confess, Madam, my Words imply an
Accusation very remote from my Intention.</P>
<P>It has always been the Rule of my Life, not
to justify any Words or Actions because they
mine.</P>
<P>I am asham'd of my Negligence, I am
sorry for my Warmth, and intreat your Lady∣ship
to pardon▪ a Fault which I hope never
to repeat.</P>
<P>The Reparation, Sir, said <HI>Arabella</HI> smiling,
over-balances the Offence, and by thus daring
<PB N="310" REF="312"/>
to own you have been in the Wrong, you
have rais'd in me a much higher Esteem for
you.</P>
<P>Yet I will not pardon you, added she,
without enjoining you a Penance for the Fault
you own you have committed; and this Pe∣nance
shall be to prove,</P>
<P>First, That these Histories you condemn
are Fictions.</P>
<P>Next, That they are absurd.</P>
<P>And Lastly, That they are Criminal.</P>
<P>The Doctor was pleas'd to find a Reconci∣liation
offer'd upon so very easy Terms, with
a Person whom he beheld at once with Reve∣rence
and Affection, and could not offend
without extreme Regret.</P>
<P>He therefore answered with a very chearful
Composure:</P>
<P>To prove those Narratives to be Fictions,
Madam, is only difficult, because the Position
is almost too evident for Proof.</P>
<P>Your Ladyship knows, I suppose to what
Authors these Writings are ascrib'd?</P>
<P>To the <HI>French</HI> Wits of the last Century,
said <HI>Arabella.</HI></P>
<P>And at what Distance, Madam, are the
Facts related in them from the Age of the
Writer?</P>
<P>I was never exact in my Computation, re∣plied
<HI>Arablela;</HI> but I think most of the Events
happen'd about two thousand Years ago.</P>
<P>How then, Madam, resum'd the Doctor,
could these Events be so minutely known to
<PB N="311" REF="313"/>
Writers so far remote from the Time in which
they happen'd?</P>
<P>By Records, Monuments, Memoirs, and
Histories, answered the Lady.</P>
<P>But by what Accident, then, said the Doctor
smiling, did it happen these Records and Mo∣numents
were kept universally secret to Man∣kind
till the last Century?</P>
<P>What brought all the Memoirs of the re∣motest
Nations and earliest Ages only to
<HI>France?</HI></P>
<P>Where were they hidden that none could con∣sult
them but a few obscure Authors?</P>
<P>And whither are they now vanished again
that they can be found no more?</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> having sat silent a while, told him,
That she found his Questions very difficult to
be answer'd; and that though perhaps the Au∣thors
themselves could have told whence they
borrowed their Materials, she should not at
present require any other Evidence of the first
Assertion:</P>
<P>But allow'd him to suppose them Fictions,
and requir'd now that he should shew them to
be absurd.</P>
<P>Your Ladyship, return'd he, has, I find,
too much Understanding to struggle against
Demonstration, and too much Veracity to de∣ny
your Convictions; therefore some of the
Arguments by which I intended to shew the
Falshood of these Narratives may be now used
to prove their Absurdity.</P>
<P><PB N="312" REF="314"/>
You grant them, Madam, to be Fictions?</P>
<P>Sir, interrupted <HI>Arabella</HI> eagerly, You are
again infringing the Laws of Disputation.</P>
<P>You are not to confound a Supposition
of which I allow you only the present Use,
with an unlimited and irrevocable Conces∣sion.</P>
<P>I am too well acquainted with my own
Weakness to conclude an Opinion false,
merely because I find myself unable to de∣fend
it.</P>
<P>But I am in haste to hear the Proof of the
other Positions, not only because they may
perhaps supply what is deficient in your Evi∣dence
of the first, but because I think it of
more Importance to detect Corruption than
Fiction.</P>
<P>Though indeed Falshood is a Species of Cor∣ruption,
and what Falshood is more hateful
than the Falshood of History.</P>
<P>Since you have drawn me back, Madam,
to the first Question, returned the Doctor,
Let me know what Arguments your Lady∣ship
can produce for the Veracity of these
Books.</P>
<P>That there are many Objections against
it, you yourself have allowed, and the high∣est
moral Evidence of Falshood appears when
there are many Arguments against an Assertion,
and none for it.</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="315"/>
Sir, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> I shall never think that
any Narrative, which is not confuted by its
own Absurdity, is without one Argument at
least on its Side; there is a Love of Truth in
the human Mind, if not naturally implanted,
so easily obtained from Reason and Expe∣rience,
that I should expect it universally to
prevail where there is no strong Temptation to
Deceit; we hate to be deceived, we therefore
hate those that deceive us; we desire not to
be hated, and therefore know that we are not
to deceive. Shew me an equal Motive to
Falshood, or confess that every Relation has
some Right to Credit.</P>
<P>This may be allowed, Madam, said the Doc∣tor,
when we claim to be credited, but that
seems not to be the Hope or Intention of these
Writers.</P>
<P>Surely Sir, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> you must mis∣take
their Design; he that writes without In∣tention
to be credited, must write to little Pur∣pose;
for what Pleasure or Advantage can a∣rise
from Facts that never happened? What
Examples can be afforded by the Patience
of those who never suffered, or the Chastity of
those who were never solicited? The great
End of History, is to shew how much human
Nature can endure or perform. When we
hear a Story in common Life that raises our
Wonder or Compassion, the first Confutation
stills our Emotions, and however we were
touched before, we then chase it from the Me∣mory
with Contempt as a Trifle, or with In∣dignation
as an Imposture. Prove, therefore,
that the Books which I have hitherto read as
<PB N="314" REF="316"/>
Copies of Life, and Models of Conduct, are
empty Fictions, and from this Hour I deliver
them to Moths and Mould; and from this
Time consider their Authors as Wretches who
cheated me of those Hours I ought to have
dedicated to Application and Improvement,
and betrayed me to a Waste of those Years in
which I might have laid up Knowledge for my
future Life.</P>
<P><HI>Shakespear,</HI> said the Doctor, calls just Re∣sentment
the Child of Integrity, and therefore
I do not wonder, that what Vehemence the
Gentleness of your Ladyship's Temper allows,
should be exerted upon this Occasion. Yet
though I cannot forgive these Authors for ha∣ving
destroyed so much valuable Time, yet I
cannot think them intentionally culpable, be∣cause
I cannot believe they expected to be cre∣dited.
Truth is not always injured by Fiction.
An admirable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Richardson.</NOTE> Writer of our own Time, has
found the Way to convey the most solid In∣structions,
the noblest Sentiments, and the most
exalted Piety, in the pleasing Dress of a<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Clarissa.</NOTE> No∣vel,
and, to use the Words of the greatest<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The Author of the Ra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bler.</NOTE>
Genius in the present Age, <Q>Has taught the
Passions to move at the Command of Vir∣tue.</Q>
The Fables of <HI>Aesop,</HI> though never
I suppose believed, yet have been long consi∣dered
as Lectures of moral and domestic
Wisdom, so well adapted to the Faculties of
Man, that they have been received by all civi∣lized
Nations; and the <HI>Arabs</HI> themselves have
honoured his Translator with the Appellation
of <HI>Looman</HI> the Wise.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="317"/>
The Fables of <HI>Aesop,</HI> said <HI>Arabella,</HI> are a∣mong
those of which the Absurdity discovers
itself, and the Truth is comprised in the Ap∣plication;
but what can be said of those Tales
which are told with the solemn Air of histori∣cal
Truth, and if false convey no Instruction?</P>
<P>That they cannot be defended Madam, said
the Doctor, it is my Purpose to prove, and if to
evince their Falshood be sufficient to procure
their Banishment from your Ladyship's Closet,
their Day of Grace is near an end. How is
any oral, or written Testimony, confuted or
confirmed?</P>
<P>By comparing it, says the Lady, with the
Testimony of others, or with the natural Ef∣fects
and standing Evidence of the Facts rela∣ted,
and sometimes by comparing it with itself.</P>
<P>If then your Ladyship will abide by this last,
returned he, and compare these Books with
antient Histories, you will not only find innu∣merable
Names, of which no Mention was
ever made before, but Persons who lived in
different Ages, engaged as the Friends or Ri∣vals
of each other. You will perceive that
your Authors have parcelled out the World at
Discretion, erected Palaces, and established
Monarchies wherever the Conveniency of
their Narrative required them, and set Kings
and Queens over imaginary Nations. Nor have
they considered themselves as invested with less
Authority over the Works of Nature, than the
Institutions of Men; for they have distributed
Mountains and Desarts, Gulphs and Rocks,
wherever they wanted them, and whenever the
Course of their Story required an Expedient,
<PB N="316" REF="318"/>
raised a gloomy Forest, or overflowed the Re∣gions
with a rapid Stream.</P>
<P>I suppose, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> you have no In∣tention
to deceive me, and since, if what you
have asserted be true, the Cause is undefensi∣ble,
I shall trouble you no longer to argue on
this Topic, but desire now to hear why, sup∣posing
them Fictions, and intended to be re∣ceived
as Fictions, you censure them as ab∣surd?</P>
<P>The only Excellence of Falshood, answered
he, is its Resemblance to Truth; as therefore
any Narrative is more liable to be confuted by
its Inconsistency with known Facts, it is at a
greater Distance from the Perfection of Fic∣tion;
for there can be no Difficulty in framing
a Tale, if we are left at Liberty to invert all
History and Nature for our own Conveniency.
When a Crime is to be concealed, it is easy
to cover it with an imaginary Word. When
Virtue is to be rewarded, a Nation with
a new Name may, without any Ex∣pence
of Invention, raise her to the Throne.
When <HI>Ariosto</HI> was told of the Magnificence of
his Palaces, he answered, that the Cost of po∣etical
Architecture was very little; and
still less is the Cost of Building without Art,
than without Materials. But their historical
Failures may be easily passed over, when we
consider their physical or philosophical Absur∣dities;
to bring Men together from different
Countries does not shock with every inherent or
demonstrable Absurdity, and therefore when
we read only for Amusement, such Impropri∣eries
may be born: But who can forbear to
<PB N="317" REF="319"/>
throw away the Story that gives to one Man
the Strength of Thousands; that puts Life
or Death in a Smile or a Frown; that recounts
Labours and Sufferings to which the Powers
of Humanity are utterly unequal; that disfigures
the whole Appearance of the World, and re∣presents
every Thing in a Form different from
that which Experience has shewn. It is the
Fault of the best Fictions, that they teach
young Minds to expect strange Adventures
and sudden Vicissitudes, and therefore encou∣rage
them often to trust to Chance. A long
Life may be passed without a single Occur∣rence
that can cause much Surprize, or pro∣duce
any unexpected Consequence of great
Importance; the Order of the World is so
established, that all human Affairs proceed in
a regular Method, and very little Opportunity
is left for Sallies or Hazards, for Assault or
Rescue; but the Brave and the Coward, the
Sprightly and the Dull, suffer themselves to
be carried alike down the Stream of Custom.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> who had for some Time listened
with a Wish to interrupt him, now took
Advantage of a short Pause. I cannot imagine,
Sir, said she, that you intend to deceive me,
and therefore I am inclined to believe that you
are yourself mistaken, and that your Applica∣tion
to Learning has hindered you from that
Acquaintance with the World, in which these
Authors excelled. I have not long conversed
in Public, yet I have found that Life is sub∣ject
to many Accidents. Do you count my
late Escape for nothing? Is it to be numbered
among daily and cursory Transactions, that a
<PB N="318" REF="320"/>
Woman flies from a Ravisher into a rapid
Stream?</P>
<P>You must not, Madam, said the Doctor,
urge as an Argument the Fact which is at pre∣sent
the Subject of Dispute.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> blushing at the Absurdity she had
been guilty of, and not attempting any Sub∣terfuge
or Excuse, the Doctor found himself
at Liberty to proceed:</P>
<P>You must not imagine, Madam, continued
he, that I intend to arrogate any Superiority,
when I observe that your Ladyship must suffer
me to decide, in some Measure authoritatively,
whether Life is truly described in those Books;
the Likeness of a Picture can only be determin∣ed
by a Knowledge of the Original. You
have yet had little Opportunity of knowing the
Ways of Mankind, which cannot be learned
but from Experience, and of which the highest
Understanding, and the lowest, must enter the
World in equal Ignorance. I have lived
long in a public Character, and have thought
it my Duty to study those whom I have under∣taken
to admonish or instruct. I have never
been so rich as to affright Men into Disguise
and Concealment, nor so poor as to be kept
at a Distance too great for accurate Observa¦tion.
I therefore presume to tell your Lady∣ship,
with great Confidence, that your Wri∣ters
have instituted a World of their own, and
that nothing is more different from a human
Being, than Heroes or Heroines.</P>
<P>I am afraid, Sir, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> that the
Difference is not in Favour of the present
World.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="321"/>
That, Madam, answered he your own
Penetration will enable you to judge when it
shall have made you equally acquainted with
both: I have no desire to determine a Question,
the Solution of which will give so little
Pleasure to Purity and Benevolence.</P>
<P>The Silence of a Man who loves to praise
is a Censure sufficiently severe, said the
Lady. May it never happen that you should
be unwilling to mention the Name of <HI>Arabella.</HI>
I hope wherever Corruption prevails in the
World, to live in it with Virtue, or, if I find
myself too much endanger'd, to retire from it
with Innocence. But if you can say so little
in Commendation of Mankind, how will
you prove these Histories to be vicious, which
if they do not describe real Life, give us an Idea
of a better Race of Beings than now inhabit
the World.</P>
<P>It is of little Importance, Madam, replied
the Doctor, to decide whether in the real or
fictitious Life, most Wickedness is to be
found. Books ought to supply an Antidote
to Example, and if we retire to a contem∣plation
of Crimes, and continue in our
Closets to inflame our Passions, at what time
must we rectify our Words, or purify our
Hearts? The immediate Tendency of these
Books which your Ladyship must allow me to
mention with some Severity, is to give new
Fire to the Passions of Revenge and Love;
two Passions which, even without such power∣ful
Auxiliaries, it is one of the severest La∣bours
of Reason and Piety to suppress, and
which yet must be suppressed if we hope to be
<PB N="320" REF="322"/>
approved in the Sight of the only Being
where Approbation can make us Happy. I
am afraid your Ladyship will think me too
serious.—I have already learned too much
from you, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> to presume to
instruct you, yet suffer me to caution you ne∣ver
to dishonour your sacred Office by the Low∣liness
of Apologies. Then let me again ob∣serve,
resumed he, that these Books soften the
Heart to Love, and harden it to Murder.
that they teach Women to exact Ven∣geance,
and Men to execute it; teach Women to
expect not only Worship, but the dteadful
Worship of human Sacrifices. Every Page of
these Volumes is filled with such extravagance
of Praise, and expressions of Obedience as one
human Being ought not to hear from another;
or with Accounts of Battles, in which thousands
are slaughtered for no other Purpose than to
gain a Smile from the haughty Beauty, who
sits a calm Spectatress of the Ruin and De∣solation,
Bloodshed and Misery, incited by
herself.</P>
<P>It is impossible to read these Tales with
out lessening part of that Humility, which
by preserving in us a Sense of our Alliance
with all human nature, keeps us awake to Ten∣derness
and Sympathy, or without impairing
that Compassion which is implanted in us as
an Incentive to Acts of Kindness. If there be
any preserved by natural Softness, or early
Education from learning Pride and Cruelty,
they are yet in danger of being betrayed to the
Vanity of Beauty, and taught the Arts of
Intrigue.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="323"/>
Love, Madam, is, you know, the Business, the
sole Business of Ladies in Romances. <HI>Arabella</HI>'s
Blushes now hinder'd him from proceeding as
he had intended. I perceive, continued, he that
my Arguments begin to be less agreeable to
your Ladyship's Delicacy, I shall therefore
insist no longer upon false Tenderness of
Sentiment, but proceed to those Outrages of
the violent Passions which, though not more
dangerous, are more generally hateful.</P>
<P>It is not necessary, Sir, interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI>
that you strengthen by any new Proof a Posi∣tion
which when calmly considered cannot be
denied; my Heart yields to the Force of Truth,
and I now wonder how the Blaze of Enthu∣siastic
Bravery, could hinder me from remark∣ing
with Abhorrence the Crime of deliberate
unnecessary Bloodshed.</P>
<P>I begin to perceive that I have hitherto at
least trifled away my Time, and fear that I have
already made some Approaches to the Crime of
encouraging Violence and Revenge. I hope,
Madam, said the good Man with Horror in his
Looks, that no Life was ever lost by your In∣citement.
<HI>Arabella</HI> seeing him thus moved,
burst into Tears, and could not immediately
answer. Is it possible, cried the Doctor, that
such Gentleness and Elegance should be stained
with Blood? Be not too hasty in your Censure,
said <HI>Arabella,</HI> recovering herself, I tremble in∣deed
to think how nearly I have apprroached
the Brink of Murder, when I thought myself
only consulting my own Glory; but whatever
I suffer, I will never more demand or instigate
Vengeance, nor consider my Punctilios as
<PB N="322" REF="324"/>
important enough to be ballanced against Life.</P>
<P>The Doctor confirmed her in her new Re∣solutions,
and thinking Solitude was necessary
to compose her Spirits after the Fatigue of so
long a Conversation, be retired to acquaint Mr
<HI>Glanville</HI> with his Success, who in the Trans∣port
of his Joy was almost ready to throw
himself at his Feet, to thank him for the Miracle,
as he called it, that he had performed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which the History is concluded.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR <HI>Glanville,</HI> who fancied to himself the
most ravishing Delight from conversing
with his lovely Cousin, now recovered to the
free Use of all her noble Powers of Reason,
would have paid her a Visit that afternoon,
had not a moments Reflection convinced him
that now was the Time, when her Mind was
labouring under the force of Conviction,
to introduce the repentant Sir <HI>George</HI> to her,
who by confessing the ridiculous Farce he had
invented to deceive her, might restore him to
her good Opinion, and add to the Doctor's
solid Arguments the poignant Sting of Ri∣dicule
which she would then perceive she had
incurred.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George</HI> being now able to leave his Cham∣ber,
and <HI>Arabella</HI> well enough recovered to
admit a Visit in hers, Mr <HI>Glanville</HI> intreated
his Father to wait on her, and get Permission
<PB N="323" REF="325"/>
for Sir <HI>George</HI> to attend her upon a Business
of some Consequence. Sir <HI>Charles</HI> no sooner
mentioned this Request, than <HI>Arabella</HI> after
a little Hesitation complied with it. As she
had been kept a Stranger to all the Particulars
of Mr <HI>Glanville</HI>'s Quarrels with the young
Baronet, her Thoughts were a little perplex'd
concerning the Occasion of this Visit, and
her Embarrassment was considerably increased
by the Confusion which she perceived in the
Countenance of Sir <HI>George.</HI> It was not
without some Tokens of a painfully supprest
Reluctance that Sir <HI>George</HI> consented to per∣form
his Promise, when Mr <HI>Glanville</HI> claim'd
it, but the Disadvantages that would attend
his Breach of it, dejected and humbled as he
now was, presenting themselves in a forcible
manner to his Imagination, confirmed his
wavering Resolutions. And since he found
himself obliged to be his own Accuser, he en∣deavoured
to do it with the best Grace he
could. Acknowledging therefore to Lady
<HI>Bella</HI> all the Artifices her Deception by Ro∣mances
had given him Encouragement to
use upon her, and explaining very explicitly
the last with relation to the pretended Princess
of <HI>Gaul,</HI> he submissively asked her Pardon for
the Offence it would now give her, as well
as for the Trouble it had formerly.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> struck with inconceivable Cnfusion,
having only bowed her Head to his Apology desi∣red
to be left alone, and continued for near two
Hours afterwards wholly absorb'd in the most
disagreeable Reflections on the Absurdity of
her past Behaviour, and the Contempt and Ri∣dicule
<PB N="324" REF="326"/>
to which she now saw plainly she had
exposed herself. The Violence of these first
Emotions having at length subsided, she sent
for Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> and having
with a noble Ingenuity expatiated upon the
Follies her vitiated Judgment had led her into,
she apologized to the first, for the frequent
Causes she had given him of Uneasiness; and,
turning to Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> whom she beheld
with a Look of mingled Tenderness and Mo∣desty,
To give you myself, with all my re∣maining
Imperfections, is making you but a
poor Present in return for the Obligations your
generous Affection has laid me under to you;
yet since I am so happy as to be desired for a
Partner for Life by a Man of your Sense and
Honour, I will endeavour to make myself as
worthy as I am able of such a favourable Di∣stinction.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> kissed the Hand she gave him
with an emphatic Silence, while Sir <HI>Charles,</HI>
in the most obliging Manner imaginable,
thanked her for the Honour she conferred both
on himself and Son by this Alliance.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George,</HI> entangled in his own Artifices,
saw himself under a Necessity of confirming the
Promises he had made to Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> during
his Fit of Penitence, and was accordingly mar∣ried
to that young Lady, at the same Time
that Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> and <HI>Arabella</HI> were united.</P>
<P>We chuse, Reader, to express this Circum∣stance,
though the same, in different Words,
as well to avoid Repetition, as to intimate that
the first mentioned Pair were indeed only mar∣ried
<PB N="325" REF="327"/>
in the common Acceptation of the Word;
that is, they were privileged to join Fortunes,
Equipages, Titles, and Expence; while Mr.
<HI>Glanville</HI> and <HI>Arabella</HI> were united, as well in
these, as in every Virtue and laudable Affec∣tion
of the Mind.</P>
