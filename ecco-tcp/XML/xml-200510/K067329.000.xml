<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been a long Complaint of the Vertuous
and Refined World, that Poesie whose Original
is Divine, should be enslav'd to Vice and Profane∣ness;
that an Art inspired from Heaven should have
so far lost the Memory of its Birth-place, as to be in∣gaged
in the Interests of Hell: and bring all her re∣sistless
Forces of Metaphor, Wit, Rhyme and Num∣ber,
and range them under the Banner of the Great
Malicious Spirit to assault the Honour of God and
the Souls of Men.</P>
<P>The Eldest Song which History has brought down
to our Ears was a noble Act of Worship paid to the
God of <HI>Israel,</HI> <Q>When his <HI>Right hand became glo∣rious
in Power, when thy Right hand, O Lord,
dashed in pieces the Enemy; the Chariots of Pharaoh
and his Host were cast into the Red-Sea; Thou didst
blow with thy Wind, the Deep covered them, and
they sank as Lead in the mighty Waters,</HI> Exod. 15.</Q>
This Art was maintain'd Sacred thro' the following
Ages of the Church, and imploy'd by Kings and Pro∣phets,
by <HI>David, Solomon,</HI> and <HI>Isaiah,</HI> in breathing
the Life of Angels into the Hearts of Men, and rear∣ing
their Minds Heavenward in warm and tuneful
Devotion.</P>
<P><PB REF="3"/>
In the Younger Days of Heathenism the Muses
were devoted to the same Service: The Language in
which Old <HI>Hesiod</HI> addresses them is this.<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" EXTENT="2 lines" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,</L></Q><Q>In English.
<LG>
<L>Pierian Muses, fam'd for Heavenly Lays,</L>
<L>Descend, and sing the God your Fathers Praise.</L>
</LG></Q>And the pursues the Subject in ten Pious Lines, which
I could not forbear to Transcribe if the Aspect and
Sound of so much <HI>Greek</HI> were not terrifying to a nice
Reader.</P>
<P>But some of the later Poets of the <HI>Pagan</HI> World
have more debased this Divine Gift, and many of
the Writers of first Rank in this our Age of Na∣tional
Christians have to their Eternal Shame surpas∣sed
the vilest of the Gentiles. They have Expos'd
Religion to Drollery, and drest her up in the most
Ridiculous Habit, for the Scorn of the ruder Herd
of Mankind. They have painted the Vices like so
many Goddesses, added the Charms of Wit to Debau∣chery,
and heightned the Temptation where Nature
needs the strongest Restraints. With Sweetness of
Sound and Delicacy of Expression they have given a
Relish to Blasphemies of the harshest kind, and when
they rant at their Maker in Sonorous Numbers they
fancy themselves to have acted the Hero well.</P>
<P><PB REF="4"/>
Thus almost in vain have the Throne and the Pul∣pit
cried, <HI>Reformation,</HI> while the Stage and Licen∣tious
Poems have waged open War with the Pious
Design of Church and State. The Press has spread
the Poyson far, and scatter'd wide the Mortal Infecti∣on;
Unthinking Youth have been allured to Sin be∣yond
the Vicious Propensities of Nature, plung'd
early into Diseases and Death, and sunk down to
Damnation in Multitudes. How will these Allies of
the Nether World, the Lewd and Profane Versifiers
stand aghast before the Great Judge, when the Blood
of many Souls whom they never saw shall be laid to
the Charge of their Writings, and be dreadfully re∣quir'd
at their Hands. The Reverend Mr. <HI>Collier</HI>
has set this Awful Scene before them in just and fla∣ming
Colours; and if the Application were not too
rude and uncivil, that noble Stanza of my Lord <HI>Ros∣common</HI>
on <HI>Psal.</HI> 148. might be address'd to them,
<Q><L>Ye Dragons, whose Contagious Breath</L>
<L>Peoples the dark Retreats of Death,</L>
<L>Change your dire Hissings into Heav'nly Songs,</L>
<L>And praise your Maker with your Forked Tongues.</L></Q></P>
<P>But alass! there is a deep Silence among these
Men of all Divine Subjects, unless in Banter; The
Wonders of Creating Power, the Mysteries of Re∣deeming
Love, and the mighty Works of Renewing
Grace are neglected by those, whom Heaven has in∣dued
with a Gift proper to adorn and cultivate 'em:
An Art whose sweet Insinuations might have almost
<PB REF="5"/>
convey'd Piety into resisting Nature, and melted
Souls of Iron to the Love of Virtue.</P>
<P>Will the Writers of this Age cite the <HI>French</HI> Critic
on their side, and say,
<Q><L>De la Foy d'un Chrétien les Mysteres terribles</L>
<L>D'Ornemens egayez ne sont point susceptibles:</L></Q>
That the Mysteries of Christianity are not capable of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ornaments: The <HI>Davideis</HI> and the two <HI>Arthurs</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> broke down this Obstacle, and experimentally
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>futed the vain pretence.</P>
<P>Besides, the Christian Mysteries have no need of
these Tinsel Trappings; the Glories of our Religion
in a plain Narration and a simple Dress have some∣thing
brighter and bolder in them, something more
surprizing and Divine, than all the Adventures of
Gods and Heroes, all the dazling Images of false lu∣stre
that compose and garnish a Heathen Poem; here
the Subjects themselves would give wonderful Aids
to the Muse; and the Heavenly Theme would so
relieve a dull Hour and a languishing Genius, that
when the Muse nods, the Sense would burn and
sparkle upon the Reader, and keep him feelingly
awake.</P>
<P>With how much less toil and expence might a
<HI>Dryden,</HI> an <HI>Otway,</HI> a <HI>Congreve,</HI> or a <HI>Dennis</HI> furnish
out a Christian Poem than a Modern Play; there is
nothing amongst all the Ancient Fables or Later
Romances, that have two such Extremes united in
them, as the Eternal God becoming an Infant of
Days, the Possessor of the Pallace of Heaven laid to
<PB REF="6"/>
Sleep in a Manger, the Holy <HI>Jesus</HI> who knew no
Sin bearing the Sins of Men in his Body on the
Tree, Agonies of Sorrow loading the Soul of him
who was God over all Blessed for ever; and the So∣veraign
of Life stretching his Arms on a Cross,
Bleeding and Expiring: The Heaven and the Hell
in our Divinity are infinitely more delightful and
dreadful than the Childish Figments of a Dog with
three Heads, the Buckets of the <HI>Belides,</HI> the Furies
with Snaky Hairs, or all the Flow'ry Stories of <HI>Ely∣sium.</HI>
Aud if we survey the one as Themes Divinely
True, and the other as a Medly of Fooleries which
we can never believe, the advantage for touching the
Springs of Passion will fall infinitely on the side of
the Christian Poet; our Wonder and our Love, our
Pity, Delight, and Sorrow, with the long train of
Hopes and Fears, must needs be under the Command
of an Harmonious Pen, whose every Line makes a
part of the Reader's Faith, and is the very Life or
Death of his Soul.</P>
<P>If the trifling and incredible Tales that furnish out
a Tragedy are so arm'd by Wit and Fancy as to be∣come
Soveraign of the Rational Powers, to triumph
over all the Affections, and manage our Smiles and
our Tears at pleasure; how wondrous a Conquest
might be obtain'd over a wild World, and reduce it
at least to Sobriety, if the same Happy Talent were
employed in dressing the Scenes of Religion in their
proper Figures of Majesty, Beauty and Terror. The
Affairs of this Life with their reference to a Life to
come, would shine bright in a Dramatick Descripti∣on.
The Anguish of inward Guilt, the secret Stings
<PB REF="7"/>
and Racks and Scourges of Conscience, the sweet re∣tiring
Hours and Seraphical Joys of Devotion, the
Victory of a Resolved Soul over a thousand Temp∣tations,
the Inimitable Love and Passion of a Dying
God, the Awful Glories of the last Tribunal, the
grand Decisive Sentence from which there is no Ap∣peal,
and the Consequent Transports or Horrors of
the two Eternal Worlds. How would such a Per∣formance
call back the dying Piety of the Nation to
Life and Beauty: It would make Religion appear
like it self, and confound the Blasphemies of a pro∣fligate
World, ignorant of Pious Pleasures.</P>
<P>But we have reason to fear that the Tuneful Men
of our Day have not rais'd their Ambition to so Di∣vine
a Pitch; I should rejoyce to see more of this
Coelestial Fire kindling within them, for the Flashes
that break out in some present and past Writings be∣tray
an Infernal Source. This the Incomparable
Mr. <HI>Cowley</HI> in the latter End of his Preface, and the
Ingenious Sir <HI>Richard Blackmore</HI> in the beginning of
his have so pathetically describ'd and lamented; and
I rather refer the Reader to mourn with them than
detain and tire him here. These Gentlemen in their
large and laboured Works of Poesie have given the
World happy Examples of what they wish and in∣courage
in Prose: The One in a rich Variety of
Thought and Fancy; the Other in all the Beauties
of Profuse and Florid Diction.</P>
<P>If shorter Sonnets were compos'd on sublime Sub∣jects,
such as the Psalms of <HI>David,</HI> and the Holy
Transports interspers'd in the other Sacred Writings,
or such as the Moral Odes of <HI>Horace,</HI> and the An∣cient
<PB REF="8"/>
<HI>Lyricks,</HI> I perswade my self that the Christian
Preacher would find abundant Aid from the Poet in
his Design to diffuse Vertue and allure Souls to
God. If the Heart were first inflam'd from Hea∣ven,
and the Muse were not left alone to form the
Devotion and pursue a Cold Scent, but only call'd in
as an Assistant to the Worship, then the Song would
end where the Inspiration ceases; the whole Com∣posure
would be of a Piece, all Meridian Light and
Meridian Fervor. And the same Pious Flame would
be propagated and kept glowing in the Heart of him
that reads. Some of the shorter Odes of the two
Poets now mentioned, and a few of the Reverend
Mr. <HI>Norris</HI>'s Essays in Verse are convincing Instances
of the Success of this Proposal.</P>
<P>'Tis my Opinion also that the free and unconfin'd
Measures of <HI>Pindar</HI> would best maintain the Digni∣ty
of the Theme, as well as give a loose to the De∣vout
Soul, nor check the Raptures of her Faith and
Love. Tho' in my feeble Attempts of this kind I
have most unhappily fetter'd my Thoughts in the
narrow Numbers of our Old Psalm-Translators, I
have contracted and cramp't the Sense, or render'd
it obscure and feeble by the too speedy and regular
returns of Rhime.</P>
<P>If my Friends expect a particular account of this
or any other Circumstance relating to what I here
Publish, they will be pleas'd to accept of this short
one.</P>
<PB REF="9"/>
<LIST>
<LABEL>The TITLE</LABEL>
<ITEM>Assures them that Poesy is not the Business of my
Life, and if I seized those Hours of Leisure wherein
my Soul was in a more sprightly and tuneful Frame
to entertain them or my self with a Divine or Moral
Song, I hope I shall find an Easy Pardon.</ITEM>

<LABEL>The SONGS Sacred
to DEVOTION</LABEL>
<ITEM>Were never written with a design to appear before
the Judges of Wit, but only to assist the Meditations
and Worship of Vulgar Christians, to whom the Mea∣sures
of <HI>Hopkins</HI> by Custom are grown Familiar and
Natural, and esteemed almost Sacred by being bound
up in the same Volume with Scripture. These are
but a small part of two hundred Hymns of the same
kind which are ready for Public Use if the World
receive favourably what I now present. The Rea∣son
that sent these out first, and divided them from
their Fellows, is, that in most of These there are
some Expressions which are not suited to the plain∣est
Capacities, and differ too much from the usual
<PB REF="10"/>
Methods of Speech in which Holy Things are pro∣pos'd
to the general Part of Mankind.</ITEM>

<LABEL>The ODES to VER∣TUE <HI>&amp;c.</HI></LABEL>
<ITEM>Were form'd when the Frame and Humour of my
Soul was just suited to the Subject of my Verse:
The Image of my Heart is painted in them; and if
they meet with a Reader whose Soul is akin to mine,
perhaps they may agreeably entertain him. The
Dullness of the Fancy and Coarseness of Expression
will disappear, the sameness of the Humour will
create a Pleasure, and insensibly overcome and con∣ceal
the Defects of the Muse.</ITEM>

<LABEL>The IMITATIONS</LABEL>
<ITEM>Of that Noblest <HI>Latin</HI> Poet of Modern Ages <HI>Casi∣mire
Sarbiewski</HI> of <HI>Poland</HI> would need no Excuse,
did they but arise to the Beauty of the Original. I
have often taken the Freedom to add ten or twenty
Lines, or to leave out as many, that I might suit my
Song more to my own Design, or because I found it
Impossible to present the Force, the Fineness, and
<PB REF="11"/>
the Fire of his Expression in our Language. I wish
some <HI>English</HI> Pen would import some of the Trea∣sures
of that rich Genius and bless our Nation.</ITEM>

<LABEL>The INSCRIPTIONS</LABEL>
<ITEM>To particular Friends are warranted and defended
by the Practise of the two best <HI>Lyric</HI> Writers <HI>Horace</HI>
and <HI>Casimire</HI>: And tho' the Authority of the first be
more Venerable, yet if in some Instances I prefer the
latter, I pray the Criticks to forgive me; and I hope
my Friends will excuse the Freedom of the Ad∣dress.</ITEM>

<LABEL>In the POEMS of HE∣ROIC
Measure</LABEL>
<ITEM>I have attempted in Rhime the same variety of Ca∣dence,
Comma, and Period, which Blank Verse
Glories in as its peculiar Elegance and Orna∣ment.</ITEM>

<PB REF="12"/>

<LABEL>In the PINDARIQUES</LABEL>
<ITEM>I have generally conformed my Lines to the shorter
Size of the Ancients, and avoided to imitate the Ex∣cessive
Lengths to which some Modern Writers have
stretched their Sentences, and especially the conclu∣ding
Verse. In these the Ear is the truest Judge,
nor was it made to be enslav'd to any precise Model
of Elder or Later Times.</ITEM>
</LIST>

<P>After all, I must petition my Reader to lay aside
the sowr and sullen Air of Criticism, and to assume
the Friend. Let him come with a design to be en∣tertain'd
and pleas'd, rather than to seek his own Dis∣gust
and Aversion, which will not be hard to find.
I am not so Vain as to think there are no Faults, nor
so Blind as to espy none: There is not one Copy that
intirely pleases me: The best of them sinks vastly
below the Idea which I form of a Divine or Moral
Ode. He that deals in the Mysteries of Heaven, or
of the Muses should be a Genius of no Vulgar Mould;
and as the Name of <HI>Vates</HI> belongs to both, so the
Furniture of Both is compriz'd in that Line of <HI>Ho∣race,</HI>
<Q><L>—Cui Mens Divinior, atque Os</L>
<L>Magna Locuturum—</L></Q>
<PB REF="13"/>
But what <HI>Juvenal</HI> spake in his Age abides true in
ours: A compleat Poet or a Prophet is such an one
<Q>—Qualem nequeo monstrare, &amp; sentio tantùm.</Q></P>
<P>Perhaps neither of these Characters in Perfection
shall ever be seen on Earth, till the Seventh Angel
has sounded his Awful Trumpet, till the Victory be
compleat over the Beast and his Image; when the
Natives of Heaven shall joyn in Triumphal Consort
with Prophets and Tuneful Saints, and Sing unto
their Golden Harps, <HI>Salvation Honour and Glory to
him that sits upon the Throne, and to the Lamb for
ever.</HI></P>

<OPENER>The Substance of the following
Copy, and many of the Lines as they

<L>This distant Influence, and confess his Love.</L>

<L>Once I beheld his Face, when Beams Divine</L>
<L>Broke from his Eyelids, and unusual Light</L>

<L>My Joyful Heart high leaping in my Breast</L>

To hold or seek him is my only Choice.</L>
<L>If he refrain on me to cast his Eye</L>
<L>Down from his Palace, nor my longing Soul</L>

<L>Thro' his Blue Pavement, I'll behold him still</L>
<L>With sweet reflection on the peaceful Cross,</L>
<L>All in his Blood and Anguish, groaning deep,</L>

my Letter, and believe it. I'me much concern'd
to bear of my Mother's continued Weakness; we take
our Share of those painful Disorders of Nature which
afflict her whom we Honour and Love: I know also
that your Hurries of Business must be more than dou∣bled
thereby; but we are daily leaving Care and Sin
behind us: The past Temptations shall vex us no more,

<L>A Nest for Worms, and hasten to our Home.</L>

Funeral POEM
ON

Lady Mayoress of <HI>London.</HI> <DATE>July 1701.</DATE></HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="dedication">
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAD I been a common Mourner at the Funeral of
the Dear Gentleman deceased, I should have
labour'd after more of Art in the following
Composition to supply the defect of Nature and to feign
<PB N="220" REF="240"/>
a Sorrow; but the uncommon Condescension of his
Friendship to Me, the Inward Esteem I pay his Me∣mory,
and the vast and tender Sence I have of our
Loss make all the Methods of Art needless, whilst na∣tural
Grief supplies more than all.</P>
<P>I had resolv'd indeed to lament in Sighs and Silence,
and frequently check'd the forward Muse when she
brought me Grief in Numbers, and urg'd me to a tune∣ful
Mourning; but the Importunity was not to be re∣sisted:
Long Lines of Sorrow flow'd in upon my Fancy
'ere I was aware, whilst I took many a Solitary Walk
in the Garden adjoyning to his Seat at <HI>Newington</HI>:
Nor could I free my self from the Melancholy Idea's
that crowded themselves upon me, and your Ladyship
will find throughout the Poem that the fair and unfi∣nish'd
Building which he had just raised for himself
gave almost all the turns of Mourning to my Thoughts,
for I pursue no other Topicks of Elegy then what my
Passion and my Senses led me to.</P>
<P>The Poem roves as my Eyes and Thoughts did, from
one part of the Fabrick to the other: It rises from the
Foundation, salutes the Walls, the Doors, and the
Windows, drops a Tear upon the Roof, and climbs the
Turret that dear Retreat, where I promis'd my self
many sweet Hours of his Conversation; there my Song
wanders amongst the delightful Subjects Divine and
Moral which used to Entertain our happy leisure, and
thence flings her self down to the Fields and the Shady
Walks where I so often injoy'd his pleasing Discourse,
and my Sorrows diffuse themselves there without a limit:
<PB N="221" REF="241"/>
I had quite forgotten what I was writing, till I correct
my self and rise to the Turret again to lament that De∣solate
Seat, and how vainly shines the Golden Ball
that Crowns it: Thus I have written without rule and
with a negligence becoming Woe unfeigned.</P>
<P>Had I design'd a compleat Elegy on your Dearest
Brother and intended it for publick View, I should
have followed the usual Forms of Poetry, spent whole
Pages in the Character and Praises of the Deceased,
and thence took occasion to call Mankind to Complain
aloud of the Universal and Unspeakable Loss: But I
wrote meerly for my self as a Friend of the Dead and
to ease my full Soul by breathing out my own Com∣plaint:
I knew his Character and Vertues so well that
there was no need to mention 'em while I talk'd only
with my self, for the Image of them was ever present
with me, which kept my Sorrow lively and my Tears
flowing with my Numbers.</P>
<P>Perhaps your Ladyship will expect some Divine
Thoughts and Sacred Meditations mingled with a Sub∣ject
so solemn as this is: Had I form'd a Design of
offering it to your Hands I had compos'd a more Chri∣stian
Poem: But 'twas Grief purely natural for a Death
so surprizing that drew all the Lines of it, and there∣fore
my highest Reflections are but of a Moral Strain;
Such as it is, your Ladyship requires a Copy of it, but
let it not touch your Soul too tenderly, nor renew your
own Mournings. Receive it, <HI>Madam,</HI> as a Sacrifice
of Love and Tears offer'd at the Tomb of a Departed
Friend, and let it abide with you as a Witness of that
<PB N="222" REF="242"/>
Affectionate Respect and Honour that I bore him, all
which as your Ladyships most rightful Due both by Me∣rit
and Succession, is now humbly offered by</P>
