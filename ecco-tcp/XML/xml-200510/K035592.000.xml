<P>TO
THE SURVIVING MEMBERS
OF
THAT TRULY AMIABLE FAMILY
OF WHICH
MISS M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>s
WAS ONCE A BRIGHT, A DISTINGUISHED,
AND
A JUSTLY VALUED ORNAMENT,
ARE THE FOLLOWING LINES INSCRIBED,
BY
THEIR SYMPATHIZING
FRIEND,
THE AUTHOR</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="to the reader">
<PB N="vii" REF="4"/>
<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THESE lines are sacred to the memory
of ONE who, not satisfied with the at∣tainment
of every female excellence, and every
human virtue, soared, on adventurous wing,
into the regions of science and philosophy. She
successfully rivalled those who have long been
accustomed to behold with <HI>indifference,</HI> if not
<PB N="viii" REF="5"/>
with <HI>contempt,</HI> the efforts of feminine genius,
when either classical learning or philosophical
disquisition have been the objects of pursuit.</P>
<P>ALIKE distinguished by elegance of manners,
by brilliancy of imagination, and soundness of
judgment, it is almost needless to observe that,
whilst living, she commanded the esteem and
admiration of all who were so fortunate as
to rank in the number of her friends, and who
now join in sincerely regretting that Heaven,
has for ever veiled from their eyes, ONE whose
<PB N="ix" REF="6"/>
beauty, wit, and virtue, adorned a sex that has
seldom, if ever produced her superior.</P>
<P>IT is with just diffidence that these lines are
now submitted to the public inspection. The
Author had withheld them from the press in
expectation that some abler bard would tune
the lyre to the memory of his lamented friend.
Encouraged however by the reception of a
former work, he once more ventures himself as
a candidate for public approbation; convinced
that if it be merited, it will not be withheld.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="7"/>
IN the Elegy he has expressed his hopes that
the poetical powers of Mr. Graves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The ingenious author of Euphrosyne, &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE>, the elegant
panegyrist of Miss M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>s in her infancy, will
once more be exerted in paying a worthy tribute
to her memory. Should the perusal of these
lines suggest to that accomplished scholar, the
idea of favouring the world with a fresh specimen
of his poetical talents, the Author will have the
satisfaction of knowing that, however little his
own performance may have merited the <HI>indulgence</HI>
of the public, it will have given birth to one,
<PB N="xi" REF="8"/>
that will challenge universal <HI>applause,</HI> and perpe∣tuate
the virtues of his amiable and accom∣plished
friend—to whom, alas! he now bids a
reluctant adieu in the words of Milton:
<Q><L>"Since to part,</L>
<L>"Go heavenly guest, aetherial messenger,</L>
<L>"Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore.</L>
<L>"Gentle to me and affable hath been</L>
<L>"Thy condescension, and shall be honoured ever</L>
<L>"With grateful memory."</L> <BIBL>PAR. LOST, Book viii.</BIBL></Q></P>

<LG>
<L>AS yet 'twas <HI>fancied</HI> woes alone I sung,</L>
<L>But now by <HI>real</HI> grief my lyre is strung.</L>
<L>'Tis HARRIET's gentle shade demands the lay;</L>
<L>Do thou MELPOMENE the tribute pay.</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="10"/>
Dear to the Muses, to the Graces dear,</L>
<L>They all shall weep o'er HARRIET's honour'd bier.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HARRIET who from wisdom's hallowed page</L>
<L>Had snatch'd the spoil of every distant age.</L>
<L>Pardon, thou honour'd shade, these untaught lays</L>
<L>In which I vainly 'tempt to sing thy praise.</L>
<L>Alas! no rude, no untaught verse like mine</L>
<L>Is incense worthy of a HARRIET's shrine.</L>
<L>An <HI>abler</HI> bard thy many virtues claim,</L>
<L>An abler bard <HI>shall</HI> celebrate thy name.</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="11"/>
Now shall the lyre <HI>again</HI> by him be strung,</L>
<L>Who in the down of life<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vide a Collection of Poems, entitled Euphrosyne (vol. i. p. 38) written by Mr. Graves, the classical author of the Spiritual Quixote, Columella, and Anecdotes of the Golden Vale.</NOTE> thy praises sung.</L>
<L>GRAVES shall the sad, the mournful tribute pay,</L>
<L>And hail thy spirit in the realms of day.</L>
<L>Each female charm, each human virtue thine,</L>
<L>By MANLIUS, by me, by all esteem'd divine.</L>
<L>Long may we gaze on beauty's varied throng,</L>
<L>And give to them the gently flowing song;</L>
<L>But when, ah! when, shall we <HI>thy</HI> equal see?</L>
<L>When look on her we may compare with thee?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="16" REF="12"/>
<L>IN yonder shade whilst Harriet's urn we place,</L>
<L>(That shade which once her charms were wont to grace)</L>
<L>Behold you lovely, weeping, woe-worn train,</L>
<L>The boasted pride of this our village plain;</L>
<L>Who at this awful hour by sorrow led,</L>
<L>Seek the drear mansions of the silent dead,</L>
<L>And at a much lov'd sister's hallow'd bier,</L>
<L>Pay the sad tribute of a hopeless tear;</L>
<L>Whilst MANLIUS, whose generous breast is fraught</L>
<L>With all the virtue Grecian sages taught,</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="13"/>
Midst midnight horror and funereal gloom</L>
<L>Resign'd beholds a much lov'd daughter's tomb.</L>
<L>Yet deem not ye that he no sorrow feels,</L>
<L>'Tis true philosophy his grief conceals.</L>
<L>Know on his peace this dire misfortune preys,</L>
<L>And will, we dread, cut short his valu'd days.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT mark yon aged venerable band</L>
<L>Who round their HARRIET's grave, in sorrow stand!</L>
<L>Those are the sons of poverty and woe,</L>
<L>Whose tears at her command had ceas'd to flow:</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="14"/>
But by her death alas! their woes revive,</L>
<L>Again with penury they're doom'd to strive.</L>
<L>Ah! say who now shall all their grief assuage?</L>
<L>Ah! say who now shall cheer their drooping age?</L>
<L>MANLIUS in whose breast each virtue reigns,</L>
<L>'Tis HE shall <HI>now</HI> support these aged swains,</L>
<L>Shall bid their cruel fears' their sorrows cease,</L>
<L>And smooth their passage to the realms of peace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT say what form majestic now appears,</L>
<L>Oppress'd by sorrow and dissolv'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> tears?</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="15"/>
Her sighs, her groans, her wild distracted air,</L>
<L>All, all proclaim a wretched MOTHER's care.</L>
<L>Now o'er the yawning grave she wildly bends,</L>
<L>And now to heaven unnumber'd sighs she sends;</L>
<L>Whilst both her sons sad partners of her woe,</L>
<L>In silent grief their heartfelt sorrow shew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>IN slow procession o'er the gloomy plain,</L>
<L>See the sad father lead the wretched train,</L>
<L>Who now in solemn silence homeward turn,</L>
<L>And quit, reluctant quit, their HARRIET's urn.</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="16"/>
But mark! tho' chang'd the spot, not chang'd the scene,</L>
<L>Nor yet their bosoms know a grief serene.</L>
<L>For lo! the sight of yonder dreary walls</L>
<L><HI>Her</HI> lov'd idea and <HI>their</HI> grief recals.</L>
<L>Their grief may heaven in pity soon bid cease,</L>
<L>Soon may their tortur'd souls be hush'd to peace.</L>
<L>May heaven-born hope direct their streaming eyes</L>
<L>To those bless'd realms beyond the azure skies,</L>
<L>Where HARRIET's virtues meet a bright reward</L>
<L>From HEAVEN's ALMIGHTY AND ETERNAL LORD.</L>

<HEAD>THE
EPITAPH.</HEAD>
<L>TRAV'LER! who e'er thou art, that seek'st this tomb,</L>
<L>And view'st with pleasure the surrounding gloom,</L>
<L>Stay, nor to beauty's urn thy tears refuse,</L>
<L>But let them fall like summer's sweetest dews.</L>
<L>O long uninjur'd may this willow wave,</L>
<L>And long protect this ever honour'd grave.</L>
<L>For <HI>know,</HI> beneath its sadly drooping shade</L>
<L>There rest the ashes of <HI>a lovely maid,</HI></L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="18"/>
If virtuous worth be heaven's peculiar care,</L>
<L>She does its brightest, noblest pleasures share.</L>
<L>Do thou, by Harriet's bright example led,</L>
<L>The unfrequented paths of virtue tread.</L>
<L>So shalt thou dauntless meet the power of death,</L>
<L>And so shall hope receive thy latest breath.</L>
