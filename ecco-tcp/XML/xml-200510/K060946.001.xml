<HEAD>TO THE

THE
Earl of MIDDLESEX.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My</HI> LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SUCH is the Power of In∣terest
over almost every
Mind, that no one is long with∣out
Arguments to prove any
Position which is ardently
wished to be true, or to justify
any Measures which are dictated
by Inclination.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="4"/>
By this subtil Sophistry of
Desire, I have been persuaded
to hope, that this Book may,
without Impropriety, be in∣scribed
to Your Lordship; but
am not certain, that my Rea∣sons
will have the same Force
upon other Understandings.</P>
<P>The Dread which a Writer
feels of the public Censure; the
still greater Dread of Neglect;
and the eager Wish for Support
and Protection, which is im∣pressed
by the Consciousness of
Imbecillity; are unknown to
those who have never adventured
into the World; and I am afraid,
my Lord, equally unknown to
those, who have always found
the World ready to applaud
them.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="5"/>
'Tis, therefore, not unlikely,
that the Design of this Address
may be mistaken, and the Ef∣fects
of my Fear imputed to
my Vanity: They who see Your
Lordship's Name prefixed to
my Performance, will rather
condemn my Presumption, than
compassionate my Anxiety.</P>
<P>But, whatever be supposed
my Motive, the Praise of Judg∣ment
cannot be denied me; for,
to whom can Timidity so pro∣perly
fly for Shelter, as to
him who has been so long di∣stinguished
for Candour and
Humanity? How can Vanity be
so completely gratified, as by the
allowed Patronage of him whose
Judgment has so long given a
<PB N="vi" REF="6"/>
Standard to the National Taste?
Or by what other means could
I so powerfully suppress all Op∣position,
but that of Envy, as
by declaring myself,</P>

<HEAD>THE
Female QUIXOTE. BOOK I.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Contains a Turn at Court, neither new
nor surprising—Some useless Additions
to a fine Lady's Education—The bad
Effects of a whimsical Study, which
some will say is borrowed from Cer∣vantes.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Marquis of—for a long Se∣ries
of Years, was the first and most
distinguished Favourite at Court:
He held the most honourable
Employments under the Crown,
disposed of all Places of Profit as he pleased,
presided at the Council, and in a manner
governed the whole Kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="18"/>
This extensive Authority could not fail of
making him many Enemies: He fell at last a
Sacrifice to the Plots they were continually
forming against him; and was not only re∣moved
from all his Employments, but banished
the Court for ever.</P>
<P>The Pain his undeserved Disgrace gave him,
he was enabled to conceal by the natural
Haughtiness of his Temper; and, behaving
rather like a Man who had resigned, than been
dismissed from his Posts, he imagined he
triumphed sufficiently over the Malice of his
Enemies, while he seemed to be wholly in∣sensible
of the Effects it produced. His secret
Discontent, however, was so much augmented
by the Opportunity he now had of observing
the Baseness and Ingratitude of Mankind,
which in some Degree he experienced every
Day, that he resolved to quit all Society what∣ever,
and devote the rest of his Life to Solitude
and Privacy. For the Place of his Retreat he
pitched upon a Castle he had in a very remote
Province of the Kingdom, in the Neighbour∣hood
of a small Village, and several Miles distant
from any Town. The vast Extent of Ground
which surrounded this noble Building, he had
caused to be laid out in a Manner peculiar to
his Taste: The most laborious Endeavours of
Art had been used to make it appear like the
beautiful Product of wild, uncultivated Nature.
But if this Epitome of <HI>Arcadia</HI> could boast of
only artless and simple Beauties, the Inside of
the Castle was adorned with a Magnificence
suitable to the Dignity and immense Riches of
the Owner.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="19"/>
While Things were preparing at the Castle
for his Reception, the Marquis, though now
advanced in Years, cast his Eyes on a young
Lady, greatly inferior to himself in Quality,
but whose Beauty and good Sense promised
him an agreeable Companion. After a very
short Courtship, he married her, and in a few
Weeks carried his new Bride into the Country,
from whence he absolutely resolved never to
Return.</P>
<P>The Marquis, following the Plan of Life
he had laid down, divided his Time between
the Company of his Lady, his Library, which
was large and well furnished, and his Gardens.
Sometimes he took the Diversion of Hunting,
but never admitted any Company whatever;
and his Pride and extreme Reserve rendered
him so wholly inaccessible to the Country
Gentry about him, that none ever presumed
to solicit his Acquaintance.</P>
<P>In the Second Year of his Retirement, the
Marchioness brought him a Daughter, and
died in Three Days after her Delivery. The
Marquis, who had tenderly loved her, was
extremely afflicted at her Death; but Time
having produced its usual Effects, his great
Fondness for the little <HI>Arabella</HI> intirely en∣grossed
his Attention, and made up all the
Happiness of his Life. At Four Years of
Age he took her from under the Direction of
the Nurses and Women appointed to attend
her, and permitted her to receive no Part of her
Education from another, which he was capable
of giving her himself. He taught her to read
and write in a very few Months; and, as she
<PB N="4" REF="20"/>
grew older, finding in her an uncommon
Quickness of Apprehension, and an Under∣standing
capable of great Improvements, he
resolved to cultivate so promising a Genius
with the utmost Care; and, as he frequently,
in the Rapture of paternal Fondness, expressed
himself, render her Mind as beautiful as her
Person was lovely.</P>
<P>Nature had indeed given her a most charm∣ing
Face, a Shape easy and delicate, a sweet and
insinuating Voice, and an Air so full of Dig∣nity
and Grace, as drew the Admiration of all
that saw her. These native Charms were im∣proved
with all the Heightenings of Art; her
Dress was perfectly magnificent; the best
Masters of Music and Dancing were sent for
from <HI>London</HI> to attend her. She soon became
a perfect Mistress of the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI>
Languages, under the Care of her Father;
and it is not to be doubted, but she would
have made a great Proficiency in all useful
Knowlege, had not her whole Time been
taken up by another Study.</P>
<P>From her earliest Youth she had discovered
a Fondness for Reading, which extremely de∣lighted
the Marquis; he permitted her there∣fore
the Use of his Library, in which, unfor∣tunately
for her, were great Store of Ro∣mances,
and, what was still more unfortunate,
not in the original <HI>French,</HI> but very bad
Translations.</P>
<P>The deceased Marchioness had purchased
these Books to soften a Solitude which she
found very disagreeable; and, after her Death,
<PB N="5" REF="21"/>
the Marquis removed them from her Closer
into his Library, where <HI>Arabella</HI> found them.</P>
<P>The surprising Adventures with which
they were filled, proved a most pleasing Enter∣tainment
to a young Lady, who was wholly
secluded from the World; who had no other
Diversion, but ranging like a Nymph through
Gardens, or, to say better, the Woods and
Lawns in which she was inclosed; and who
had no other Conversation but that of a grave
and melancholy Father, or her own Attend∣ants.</P>
<P>Her Ideas, from the Manner of her Life,
and the Objects around her, had taken a
romantic Turn; and, supposing Romances
were real Pictures of Life, from them she
drew all her Notions and Expectations. By
them she was taught to believe, that Love was
the ruling Principle of the World; that every
other Passion was subordinate to this; and
that it caused all the Happiness and Miseries of
Life. Her Glass, which she often consulted,
always shewed her a Form so extremely lovely,
that, not finding herself engaged in such Ad∣ventures
as were common to the Heroines in
the Romances she read, she often complained
of the Insensibility of Mankind, upon whom
her Charms seemed to have so little Influence.</P>
<P>The perfect Retirement she lived in, af∣forded
indeed no Opportunities of making the
Conquests she desired; but she could not
comprehend, how any Solitude could be ob∣scure
enough to conceal a Beauty like hers
from Notice; and thought the Reputation of
her Charms sufficient to bring a Croud of
<PB N="6" REF="22"/>
Adorers to demand her of her Father. Her
Mind being wholly filled with the most extra∣vagant
Expectations, she was alarmed by every
trifling Incident; and kept in a continual An∣xiety
by a Vicissitude of Hopes, Fears, Wishes,
and Disappointments.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Contains a Description of a Lady's Dress
in Fashion not much above Two thousand
Years ago.—The Beginning of an Ad∣venture
which seems to promise a great
deal.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>ARABELLA</HI> had now entered into her
Seventeenth Year with the Regret of see∣ing
herself the Object of Admiration to a few
Rustics only, who happened to see her; when,
one <HI>Sunday,</HI> making use of the Permission the
Marquis sometimes allowed her, to attend. Di∣vine
Service at the Church belonging to the
Village near which they lived, her Vanity was
flattered with an Adorer not altogether unwor∣thy
of her Notice.</P>
<P>This Gentleman was young, gay, hand∣some,
and very elegantly dressed; he was just
come from <HI>London</HI> with an Intention to pass
some Weeks with a Friend in that Part of the
Country; and at the time <HI>Arabella</HI> entered
the Church, his Eyes, which had wandered
from one rural Fair to another, were in an In∣stant
fixed upon her Face. She blushed with
a very becoming Modesty; and, pleased with
<PB N="7" REF="23"/>
the unusual Appearance of so fine a Gentleman,
and the particular Notice he took of her, passed
on to her Seat thro' a double Row of Country
People, who, with a Profusion of aukward Bows
and Courtesies, expressed their Respect.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hervey,</HI> for that was the Stranger's
Name, was no less surprised at her Beauty,
than the Singularity of her Dress; and the odd
Whim of being followed into the Church by
three Women-Attendants, who, as soon as she
was seated, took their Places behind her.</P>
<P>Her Dress, tho' singular, was far from be∣ing
unbecoming. All the Beauties of her Neck
and Shape were set off to the greatest Advan∣tage
by the Fashion of her Gown, which, in the
Manner of a Robe, was made to sit tight to
her Body; and fastened on the Breast with a
Knot of Diamonds. Her fine black Hair, hung
upon her Neck in Curls, which had so much
the Appearance of being artless, that all but
her Maid, whose Employment it was to give
them that Form, imagined they were so. Her
Head-dress was only a few Knots advantage∣ously
disposed, over which she wore a white
Sarsenet Hood, somewhat in the Form of a
Veil, with which she sometimes wholly cover∣ed
her fair Face, when she saw herself beheld
with too much Attention.</P>
<P>This Veil had never appeared to her so ne∣cessary
before. Mr. <HI>Hervey</HI>'s eager Glances
threw her into so much Confusion, that, pulling
it over her Face as much as she was able, she
remained invisible to him all the time they af∣terwards
stayed in the Church. This Action,
by which she would have had him understand
<PB N="8" REF="24"/>
that she was displeased at his gazing on her
with so little Respect, only increased his Curi∣osity
to know who she was.</P>
<P>When the Congregation was dismissed, he
hastened to the Door, with an Intention to of∣fer
her his Hand to help her to her Coach; but
seeing the magnificent Equipage that waited
for her, and the Number of Servants that at∣tended
it, he conceived a much higher Idea of
her Quality than he had at first; and, changing
his Design, contented himself with only bowing
to her as she passed; and as soon as her Coach
drove away, inquired of some Persons nearest
him, who she was?</P>
<P>These Rustics, highly delighted with the
Opportunity of talking to the gay <HI>Londoner,</HI>
whom they looked upon as a very extraordinary
Person, gave him all the Intelligence they were
able, concerning the Lady he inquired after;
and filled him with an inconceivable Surprize at
the strange Humour of the Marquis, who bu∣ried
so beautiful a Creature in Obscurity.</P>
<P>At his Return home he expressed his Admi∣ration
of her in Terms that persuaded his Friend,
she had made some Impression on his Heart;
and, after raillying him a little upon this Suspi∣cion,
he assumed a more serious Air, and told
him, If he really liked Lady <HI>Bella;</HI> he thought
it not impossible but he might obtain her. The
poor Girl, added he, has been kept in Confine∣ment
so long, that I believe it would not be dif∣ficult
to persuade her to free herself by Marriage.
She never had a Lover in her Life; and there∣fore
the first Person who addresses her has the
fairest Chance for succeeding.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="25"/>
Mr. <HI>Hervey,</HI> tho' he could not persuade him∣self
his Cousin was in Earnest when he advised
him to court the only Daughter of a Man of
the Marquis's Quality, and Heiress to his vast
Estates; yet relished the Scheme, and resolved
to make some Attempt upon her before he left
the Country. However, he concealed his De∣sign
from his Cousin, not being willing to ex∣pose
himself to be ridiculed, if he did not suc∣ceed;
and, turning the Advice he had given
him into a Jest, left him in the Opinion, that
he thought no more of it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which the Adventure goes on after the
accustomed Manner.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>ARABELLA,</HI> in the mean time, was
wholly taken up with the Adventure, as
she called it, at Church: The Person and
Dress of the Gentleman who had so particu∣larly
gazed on her there, was so different from
what she had been accustomed to see, that she
immediately concluded, he was of some distin∣guished
Rank. It was past a Doubt, she
thought, that he was excessively in Love with
her; and as she soon expected to have some
very extraordinary Proofs of his Passion, her
Thoughts were wholly employed on the Man∣ner
in which she should receive them.</P>
<P>As soon as she came home, and had paid
her Duty to the Marquis, she hurried to her
Chamber, to be at Liberty to indulge her agree∣able
<PB N="10" REF="26"/>
Reflections; and, after the Example of
her Heroines, when any thing extraordinary
happened to them, called her favourite Wo∣man;
or, to use her own Language, her,
<Q>in whom she confided her most secret
Thoughts.</Q></P>
<P>Well, <HI>Lucy,</HI> said she, did you observe that
Stranger who ey'd <HI>us</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Heroines always speak of themselves in the Plural Number.</NOTE> so heedfully To-day at
Church?</P>
<P>This Girl, notwithstanding her Country-Simplicity,
knew a Compliment was expected
from her on this Occasion; and therefore re∣plied,
<Q>That she did not wonder at the Gen∣tleman's
staring at her; for she was sure he
had never seen any body so handsome as her
Ladyship before.</Q></P>
<P>I have not all the Beauty you attribute to me,
said <HI>Arabella,</HI> smiling a little: And, with a very
moderate Share of it, I might well fix the At∣tention
of a Person who seemed to be not over∣much
pleased with the Objects about him:
However, pursued she, assuming a more seri∣ous
Air, if this Stranger be weak enough to en∣tertain
any Sentiments more than indifferent
for me; I charge you, upon Pain of my Dis∣pleasure,
do not be accessary to the Conveying
his presumptuous Thoughts to me either by
Letters or Messages; nor suffer him to corrupt
your Fidelity with the Presents he will very
probably offer you.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy,</HI> to whom this Speech first gave a Hint
of what she ought to expect from her Lady's
Lovers, finding herself of more Importance
<PB N="11" REF="27"/>
than she imagined, was so pleased at the
Prospect which opened to her, that it was with
some Hesitation she promised to obey her Or∣ders.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> however, was satisfied with her As∣surances
of observing her Directions; and dis∣missed
her from her Presence, not without an
Apprehension of being too well obeyed.</P>
<P>A whole Week being elapsed without meet∣ing
with the Importunities she expected, she
could hardly conceal her Surprize at so morti∣fying
a Disappointment; and frequently inter∣rogated
<HI>Lucy,</HI> concerning any Attempts the
Stranger had made on her Fidelity; but the
Answers she received, only increased her Dis∣content,
as they convinced her, her Charms
had not had the Effect she imagined.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hervey,</HI> however, had been all this
time employed in thinking of some Means to
get acquainted with the Marquis; for, being
possessed with an extraordinary Opinion of his
Wit, and personal Accomplishments, he did
not fear making some Impression on the Heart
of the young Lady; provided he could have an
Opportunity of conversing with her.</P>
<P>His Cousin's Advice was continually in his
Mind, and flattered his Vanity with the most
agreeable Hopes: But the Marquis's Fondness
for Solitude, and that Haughtiness which was
natural to him, rendered him so difficult of Ac∣cess,
that <HI>Hervey,</HI> from the Intelligence he re∣ceived
of his Humour, despaired of being able
to prosecute his Scheme; when, meeting with
a young Farmer in one of his Evening-Walks,
and entering into Conversation with him upon
<PB N="12" REF="28"/>
several Country Subjects, the Discourse at last
turned upon the Marquis of—whose fine
House and Gardens were within their View;
upon which the young Fellow informed him,
he was Brother to a young Woman that at∣tended
the Lady <HI>Arabella;</HI> and, being fond of
lengthening out the Conversation with so fine a
Gentleman, gave him, without being desired,
the domestic History of the whole Family, as
he had received it from <HI>Lucy,</HI> who was the
Sister he mentioned.</P>
<P><HI>Hervey,</HI> excessively delighted at this acci∣dental
Meeting with a Person so capable of
serving his Defign, affected a great Desire of
being better acquainted with him; and, under
Pretence of acquiring some Knowlege in rural
Affairs, accustomed himself to call so often at
<HI>William</HI>'s Farm, that at last he met with the
Person whom the Hopes of seeing had so often
carried him thither.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy,</HI> the Moment she saw him enter, know∣ing
him again, blushed at the Remembrance
of the Discourse which had passed between her
Lady and herself concerning him; and was not
at all surprised at the Endeavours he used to
speak to her apart: But, as soon as he began a
Conversation concerning <HI>Arabella,</HI> she inter∣rupted
him by saying, I know, Sir, that you
are <HI>distractedly</HI> in Love with my Lady; but she
has forbid me to receive any Letters or Messages
from you; and therefore I beg you will not
offer to bribe me; for I dare not disobey her.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hervey</HI> was at first so astonished at her
Speech, that he knew not what to think of it;
but, after a little Reflection, attributing to an
<PB N="13" REF="29"/>
Excess of aukward Cunning what, in Reality,
was an Effect of her Simplicity, he resolved to
make use of the Hint she had given him; and,
presenting her with a Couple of Guineas, in∣treated
her to venture displeasing her Lady, by
bearing a Letter from him; promising to re∣ward
her better, if she succeeded.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy</HI> made some Difficulty to comply; but,
not being able absolutely to refuse the first Bribe
that ever was offered to her, she, after some
Intreaties, consented to take the Letter; and,
receiving the Money he presented her, left him
at Liberty to write, after she had got her Bro∣ther
to furnish him with Materials for that Pur∣pose.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A Mistake, which produces no great Conse∣quences
—An extraordinary Comment
upon a Behaviour natural enough—An
Instance of a Lady's Compassion for her
Lover, which the Reader may possibly
think not very compassionate.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>HERVEY,</HI> who was Master of no great
Elegance in Letter-writing, was at first
at some Loss, how to address a Lady of her
Quality, to whom he was an absolute Stranger,
upon the Subject of Love; but, conceiving
there was no great Occasion for much Cere∣mony
in declaring himself to one who had been
educated in the Country, and who, he believ∣ed,
could not be displeased with a Lover of his
<PB N="14" REF="30"/>
Figure, he therefore, in plain Terms, told
her, how <HI>deeply</HI> he was enamoured of her; and
conjured her to afford him some Opportunity
of paying his Respects to her.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy</HI> received this Letter from him with a
worse Grace than she did the Gold; and, tho'
she promised him to deliver it to her Lady im∣mediately,
yet she kept it a Day or two before
she had the Courage to attempt it: At last,
drawing it out of her Pocket, with a bashful
Air, she presented it to her Lady, telling her it
came from the fine Gentleman whom she saw
at Church.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> blushed at the Sight of the Letter;
and tho', in Reality, she was not displeased,
yet, being a strict Observer of romantic Forms,
she chid her Woman severely for taking it.
Carry it back, added she, to the presumptuous
Writer of it; and let him know how greatly
his Insolence has offended me.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy,</HI> however, suffered the Letter to re∣main
on the Toilet, expecting some Change
in her Lady's Mind; for she traversed the
Chamber in great seeming Irresolution, often
stealing a Glance to the Letter, which she had
a strong Inclination to open; but, searching
the Records of her Memory for a Precedent,
and not finding, that any Lady ever opened a
Letter from an unknown Lover, she reiterated
her Commands to <HI>Lucy</HI> to carry it back, with
a Look and Accent so very severe, that the Girl,
extremely apprehensive of having offended her,
put the Letter again in her Pocket, resolving
to return it the first Opportunity.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="31"/>
Mr. <HI>Hervey,</HI> who had his Thoughts wholly
taken up with the flattering Prospect of Suc∣cess,
no sooner saw <HI>Lucy,</HI> who gave him his
Letter without speaking a Word, than, sup∣posing
it had been the Answer he expected, he
eagerly snatched it out of her Hand, and,
kissing it first in a Rapture of Joy, broke it
open; but his Surprize and Confusion, when
he saw it was his own Letter returned, was
inexpressible. For some Moments he kept
his Eyes fastened upon the tender Billet, as if
he was really reading it. His Disappointment,
and the ridiculous Figure he knew he must
make in the Eyes of his Messenger, filled him
with so much Confusion, that he did not dare
to look up; but, recovering himself at last,
he affected to turn it into a Jest; and, laugh∣ing
first himself, gave <HI>Lucy</HI> the Liberty of
laughing also, who had with much Difficulty
been able to prevent doing it before.</P>
<P>The Curiosity he felt to hear how she had
acquitted herself of the Trust he had reposed
in her, made him oblige her to give a Truce
to her Mirth, in order to satisfy him; and
<HI>Lucy,</HI> who was extremely exact in her Re∣lations,
told him all that had passed, without
omitting the smallest Circumstance.</P>
<P>Though it was impossible to draw any
favourable Omen from what he heard, yet he
determined to make another Effort, before he
set out for <HI>London;</HI> and, taking Leave of his
Confident, after he had appointed her to meet
him again the next Day, at her Brother's, he
went home to consider upon Means to effect
<PB N="16" REF="32"/>
his Designs, which the ill Success of his first
Attempt had not forced him to abandon.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> who expected to hear, that the
Return of his Letter would make her Lover
commit some very extravagant Actions; and
having impatiently waited for an Account of
them from <HI>Lucy;</HI> finding she seemed to
have no Intention to begin a Discourse con∣cerning
him; asked her, at last, If she had
executed her Commission, and returned the
Letter to the insolent Unknown?</P>
<P>The Girl answered, Yes.</P>
<P>Which not being all that her Lady expected,
And how did he receive it? resumed she,
peevishly.</P>
<P>Why Madam, replied <HI>Lucy,</HI> I believe he
thought your Ladyship had sent him an An∣swer;
for he kissed the Letter several times.</P>
<P>Foolish Wench! replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> How can
you imagine he had the Temerity to think I
should answer his Letter? A Favour, which,
though he had spent Years in my Service,
would have been infinitely greater than he
could have expected. No, <HI>Lucy,</HI> he kissed
the Letter, either because he thought it had been
touched at least by my Hands, or to shew the
perfect Submission with which he received my
Commands; and it is not to be doubted, but
his Despair will force him to commit some
desperate Outrage against himself, which I do
not hate him enough to wish, though he has
mortally offended me.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> was possessed of great Sensibility
and Softness; and, being really persuaded, that
her Lover would entertain some fatal Design,
<PB N="17" REF="33"/>
seemed so much affected with the Thoughts of
what might happen, that <HI>Lucy,</HI> who tenderly
loved her, begged her not to be so much con∣cerned
for the Gentleman: There is no Fear,
added she, that he will do himself a Mischief;
for when he discovered his Mistake, he laughed
heartily, as well as myself.</P>
<P>How! replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> extremely surprised,
Did he laugh?</P>
<P>Which <HI>Lucy</HI> confirming, Doubtless, re∣sumed
she, having taken a little Time to con∣sider
of so strange a Phaenomenon, he laughed,
because his Reason was disturbed at the sudden
Shock he received: Unhappy Man! his Pre∣sumption
will be severely enough punished,
though I do not add Anger to the Scorn which
I have expressed for him: Therefore, <HI>Lucy,</HI>
you may tell him, if you please, that, not∣withstanding
the Offence he has been guilty
of, I am not cruel enough to wish his Death;
and that I command him to live, if he can
live without Hope.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which one would imagine the Ad∣venture
concluded, but for a Promise,
that something else is to come.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>LUCY</HI> now began to think there was some∣thing
more, than she imagined, in this
Affair. Mr. <HI>Hervey</HI> indeed, in her Opinion,
had seemed to be very far from having any
Design to attempt his own Life; but her
<PB N="18" REF="34"/>
Lady, she thought, could not possibly be mis∣taken;
and therefore she resolved to carry her
Message to him immediately, though it was
then late in the Evening.</P>
<P>Accordingly she went to her Brother's,
where she had some Hope of meeting with
him; but not finding him there, she obliged
him to go to the House where he lived, and tell
him she desired to speak with him.</P>
<P><HI>William,</HI> being let into the Secret of his
Sister's frequent Meetings with Mr. <HI>Hervey,</HI>
imagined she had some agreeable News to ac∣quaint
him with; and therefore ran imme∣diately
to his Relation's House, which was but
at a small Distance; but he was told Mr.
<HI>Hervey</HI> was in Bed, very much indisposed, and
could not be seen.</P>
<P>This News put <HI>Lucy</HI> in a terrible Fright:
She told her Apprehensions to her Brother;
which being such as her Lady had put into her
Head, and were now confirmed by Mr. <HI>Her∣vey</HI>'s
Illness, the young Farmer stood amazed,
not being able to comprehend her Meaning;
and she, without staying to explain herself any
further, went home to the Castle, and told
her Lady, That what she feared was come to
pass; the Gentleman would certainly die; for
he was very ill in Bed.</P>
<P>This being no more than what <HI>Arabella</HI> ex∣pected,
she discovered no Surprize; but only
asked <HI>Lucy,</HI> If she had delivered her Message
to him?</P>
<P>Would you have me, Madam, replied she,
go to his House? I am afraid the Marquis
will hear of it.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="35"/>
My Father, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> can never be
offended with me for doing a charitable
Action.</P>
<P>Ah! Madam, interrupted <HI>Lucy,</HI> let me go
then immediately, for fear the poor Gentle∣man
should grow worse.</P>
<P>If he be sick almost to Death, resumed <HI>Ara∣bella,</HI>
he will recover, if I command him to do
so: When did you hear of a Lover dying
through Despair, when his Mistress let him
know it was her Pleasure he should live? But
as it will not be altogether so proper for you to
go to his House, as it may be suspected you
come from me; I'll write a few Lines, which
you shall copy, and your Brother may carry
them to him To-morrow, and I'll engage he
shall be well in a few Hours.</P>
<P>Saying this, she went into her Closet, and,
having written a short Note, made <HI>Lucy</HI> write
it over again. It was as follows:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>Lucy, To the Unfortunate Lover of her Lady.</HEAD>
<P>MY Lady, who is the most generous Per∣son
in the World, has commanded me
to tell you, that, presumptuous as you are, she
does not desire your Death; nay more, she
commands you to live, and permits you, in
case you obey her, to hope for her Pardon,
provided you keep within the Bounds she pre∣scribes
to you.</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>Adieu.</SALUTE></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>This Letter <HI>Lucy</HI> copied, and <HI>Arabella,</HI> ex∣amining
it again, thought it rather too kind;
<PB N="20" REF="36"/>
and, seeming desirous of making some Alteration
in it, <HI>Lucy,</HI> who was extremely anxious for Mr.
<HI>Hervey</HI>'s Life, fearing lest she should alter it
in such a manner, that the Gentleman might
be at Liberty to die, if he chose it, conjured
her Lady in such pressing Terms to let it re∣main
as it was, that <HI>Arabella</HI> suffered herself
to be prevailed upon by her Intreaties; and,
remembring that it was not uncommon for
the Ladies in Romances to relax a little in
their Severity through the Remonstrances of
their Women, told her, with an inchanting
Smile, that she would grant her Desire; and
went to Bed with that pleasing Satisfaction,
which every generous Mind experiences at
the Consciousness of having done some very
benevolent Action.</P>
<P>In the Morning, this life-restoring Billet
was dispatched by <HI>Lucy</HI> to her Brother, in∣closed
in one to him, charging him to carry it
to the sick Gentleman immediately.</P>
<P><HI>William,</HI> having a strong Curiosity to see
what his Sister had written, ventured to open it;
and, not being able to imagine Lady <HI>Bella</HI> had
really given her Orders to write what appeared
to him the most unintelligible Stuff in the
World, resolved to suppress this Letter till he
had questioned her a little concerning it.</P>
<P>A few Hours after, Mr. <HI>Hervey,</HI> who ex∣pected
to meet <HI>Lucy</HI> at her Brother's, came in.
His Illness having been only a violent Head∣ach,
to which he was subject, being now quite
off, he remembred the Appointment he had
made; but, having waited some time, and
she not coming, he returned again to his
<PB N="21" REF="37"/>
Cousin's, leaving word for her, that he would
see her the next Day.</P>
<P>Scarce was he gone out, when <HI>Lucy,</HI> who
longed to know what Effect her Letter had
produced in his Health, came in; and eagerly
inquiring of her Brother how Mr. <HI>Hervey</HI> was,
received for Answer, that he had been there
a Moment before she came.</P>
<P>Well, cried she, clasping her Hands to∣gether,
with Surprize, my Lady said, her Letter
would cure him, if he was ever so sick; but I
did not imagine he would have been well
enough to come abroad so soon.</P>
<P>Your Lady! interrupted <HI>William,</HI> why was
it not yourself that wrote that Letter you gave
to me?</P>
<P>No, truly, Brother, resumed she: How
was it possible I should write so fine a Letter?
My Lady <HI>made</HI> every Word of it, and I only
wrote it after her.</P>
<P><HI>William,</HI> hearing this, would not own the
Indiscretion he now thought he had been
guilty of, in keeping the Letter; but suffered his
Sister to return to her Lady, in the Belief that
he had delivered it, resolving, when he saw
her next, to say he had lost it; for he knew
not what Excuse to make to Mr. <HI>Hervey</HI> for
not giving it him when he saw him.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> received the Account of her Lover's
Recovery as a Thing she was absolutely sure
of before; and thinking she had now done all
that could be expected from her Compassion,
resumed her usual Severity, and commanded
<HI>Lucy</HI> to mention him no more. If he loves
me with that Purity he ought to do, pursued
<PB N="22" REF="38"/>
she, he will cease to importune me any further:
And though his Passion be ever so violent, his
Respect and Submission to my Commands will
oblige him to Silence. The Obedience he
has already shewn, in recovering at the first
Intimation I gave, that it was my Will he
should do so, convinces me, I need not ap∣prehend
he will renew his Follies to displease
me.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy,</HI> who found by this Discourse of her
Lady's, that her Commission was at an End
with regard to Mr. <HI>Hervey,</HI> followed her Di∣rections
so exactly, that she not only spoke no
more of him to her, but also, in order to avoid
him, neglected to go to her Brother's.</P>
<P>His Impatience at not seeing her made him
prevail upon her Brother to go the Castle, and
intreat her to give him another Interview: But
<HI>Lucy</HI> positively refused; and, to make a Merit
with her Lady of her Obedience, informed
her what he had requested.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> resenting a Boldness which argued
so little Respect to her Commands, began
now to repent of the Compassion she had
shewn him; and, commending <HI>Lucy</HI> for what
she had done, bid her tell the insolent Un∣known,
if he ever sent to her again, that she
was resolved never to pardon the Contempt
he had shewn for her Orders.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hervey,</HI> finding himself deserted by
<HI>Lucy,</HI> resolved to give over his Attempts, con∣gratulating
himself for his Discretion in not
acquainting his Cousin with what he had al∣ready
done: His Heart not being very much
engaged, he found no great Difficulty in con∣soling
<PB N="23" REF="39"/>
himself for his bad Success. In a few
Days he thought of Lady <HI>Bella</HI> no more, than
if he had never seen her; but an Accident
bringing her again in his Way, he could not
resist the Inclination he felt to speak to her;
and by that means drew upon himself a very
sensible Mortification.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which the Adventure is really concluded;
tho', possibly, not as the Reader expected.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Marquis sometimes permitting his
Daughter to ride out, and this being
the only Diversion she was allowed, or ever ex∣perienced,
she did not fail to take it as often as
she could.</P>
<P>She was returning from one of these Airings
one Day, attended by two Servants, when
Mr. <HI>Hervey,</HI> who happened to be at some Di∣stance,
observing a Lady on Horseback, who
made a very graceful Figure, he rode up to
her, in order to have a nearer View; and,
knowing Lady <HI>Bella</HI> again, resolved to speak
to her: But while he was considering how he
should accost her, <HI>Arabella</HI> suddenly seeing him,
and observing he was making up to her, her
Imagination immediately suggested to her, that
this insolent Lover had a Design to seize her
Person; and this Thought terrifying her ex∣tremely,
she gave a loud Shriek; which Mr.
<HI>Hervey</HI> hearing, rode eagerly up to her to in∣quire
<PB N="24" REF="40"/>
the Reason of it, at the same time that
her two Attendants, as much amazed as him∣self,
came galloping up also.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> upon his coming close to her, re∣doubled
her Cries. If you have any Valour,
said she to her Servants, defend your unfortu∣nate
Mistress, and rescue her from this unwor∣thy
Man.</P>
<P>The Servants, believing him to be a High∣wayman,
by this Exclamation, and dreading
lest he should present his Pistol at their Heads,
if they offered to make any Resistance, recoiled
a few Paces back, expecting he would demand
their Purses when he had robbed their Lady:
But the extreme Surprize he was in, keeping
him motionless, the Fellows not seeing any
Pistols in his Hand, and animated by <HI>Arabella</HI>'s
Cries, who, calling them Cowards and Trai∣tors,
urged them to deliver her; they both, in
a Moment, laid hold of Mr. <HI>Hervey,</HI> and forced
him to alight; which they did also themselves,
still keeping fast hold of him, whom Surprize,
Shame, and Rage, had hitherto kept silent.</P>
<P>Rascals! cried he, when he was able to
speak, what do you mean by using me in this
manner? Do you suppose I had any Intention
to hurt the Lady?—What do you take me
for?</P>
<P>For a Villain, for a Ravisher, interrupted
<HI>Arabella,</HI> who, contrary to all Laws both hu∣man
and divine, endeavour to possess yourself
by Force of a Person whom your are not worthy
to serve; and whose Charity and Compassion
you have returned with the utmost Ingratitude.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="41"/>
Upon my Word, Madam, said Mr. <HI>Hervey,</HI>
I don't understand one Word you say: You
either mistake me for some other Person, or are
pleased to divert yourself with the Surprize I am
in: But I beseech you carry the Jest no farther,
and order your Servants to let me go; or, by
Heaven—cried he struggling to get loose, if I
can but free one of my Hands, I'll stab the
Scoundrels before your Face.</P>
<P>It is not with Threats like these, resumed
<HI>Arabella</HI> with great Calmness, that I can be
moved. A little more Submission and Respect
would become you better; you are now wholly
in my Power; I may, if I please, carry you to
my Father, and have you severely punished for
your Attempt: But to shew you, that I am as
generous as you are base and designing, I'll give
you Freedom, provided you promise me never
to appear before me again: But, in order to se∣cure
my own Safety, you must deliver up your
Arms to my Servants, that I may be assured you
will not have it in your Power to make a second
Attempt upon my Liberty.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hervey,</HI> whose Astonishment was in∣creased
by every Word she spoke, began now to
be apprehensive, that this might prove a very
serious Affair, since she seemed resolved to be∣lieve
he had a Design to carry her off; and,
knowing that an Attempt of that Nature upon
an Heiress might have dangerous Consequences,
he resolved to accept the Conditions she offered
him: But while he delivered his Hanger to the
Servant, he assured her in the strongest Terms,
that he had no other Design in riding up to her,
but to have a nearer View of her Person.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="42"/>
Add not Falshood, said <HI>Arabella</HI> sternly, to a
Crime already black enough; for tho', by an
Effect of my Generosity, I have resolved not to
deliver you up to the Resentment of my Father,
yet nothing shall ever be able to make me par∣don
this Outrage. Go then, pursued she, go,
base Man, unworthy of the Care I took of thy
Safety; go to some distant Country, where I
may never hear of thee more; and suffer me, if
possible, to lose the Remembrance of thy
Crimes,</P>
<P>Saying this, she ordered her Servants, who
had got the Hanger in their Possession, to set
him at Liberty, and mount their Horses; which
they did immediately, and followed their Lady,
who rode with all imaginable Speed to the
Castle.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hervey,</HI> not yet recovered from his Sur∣prize,
stood some Moments considering the
strange Scene he had been Witness to; and in
which he had, much against his Will, appeared
the principal Character. As he was not ac∣quainted
with Lady <HI>Bella</HI>'s Foible, he concluded
her Fears of him were occasioned by her Sim∣plicity,
and some Misrepresentations that had
been made her by <HI>Lucy,</HI> who, he thought, had
betrayed him; and, fearing this ridiculous
Adventure would be soon made public, and him∣self
exposed to the Sneers of his Country Ac∣quaintance,
he resolved to go back to <HI>London</HI> as
soon as possible.</P>
<P>The next Day, pretending he had received a
Letter which obliged him to set out immedi∣ately,
he took Leave of his Cousin, heartily
glad at the Escape he should make from his Rail∣lery;
<PB N="27" REF="43"/>
for he did not doubt but the Story would
very soon be known, and told greatly to his Dis∣advantage.</P>
<P>But <HI>Arabella,</HI> in order to be completely ge∣nerous,
a Quality for which all the Heroines
are famous, laid a Command upon her two At∣tendants
not to mention what had passed, giv∣ing
them, at the same time, Money to secure
their Secrecy; and threatening them with her
Displeasure, if they disobeyed.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> as soon as she had an Opportunity,
did not fail to acquaint her faithful <HI>Lucy</HI> with
the Danger from which she had so happily
escaped, thanking Heaven at the same time
with great Devotion, for having preserved her
from the Hands of the Ravisher.</P>
<P>Two or three Months rolled away, after this
Accident, without offering any new Adventure
to our fair Visionary; when her Imagination,
always prepossessed with the same fantastic Ideas,
made her stumble upon another Mistake, equal¦ly
absurd and ridiculous.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which some Contradictions are very hap∣pily
reconciled.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Marquis's head Gardener had received
a young Fellow into his Master's Service,
who had lived in several Families of Distinction.
He had a good Face; was tolerably genteel;
and, having an Understanding something above
his Condition, join'd to a great deal of <HI>second∣hand</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="44"/>
Politeness, which he had contracted while
he lived at <HI>London,</HI> he appeared a very extraor∣dinary
Person among the Rustics who were his
Fellow-Servants.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> when she walked in the Garden,
had frequent Opportunities of seeing this young
Man, whom she observed with a very particular
Attention. His Person and Air had something,
she thought, very distinguishing. When she
condescended to speak to him about any Busi∣ness
he was employed in, she took Notice, that
his Answers were framed in a Language vastly
superior to his Condition; and the Respect he
paid her had quite another Air from that of
the aukward Civility of the other Servants.</P>
<P>Having discerned so many Marks of a Birth
far from being mean, she easily passed from an
Opinion that he was a Gentleman, to a Belief
that he was something more; and every new
Sight of him adding Strength to her Suspicions,
she remained, in a little time, perfectly con∣vinced
that he was some Person of Quality, who,
disguised in the Habit of a Gardener, had intro∣duced
himself into her Father's Service, in or∣der
to have an Opportunity of declaring a Pas∣sion
to her, which must certainly be very great,
since it had forced him to assume an Appearance
so unworthy of his noble Extraction.</P>
<P>Wholly possessed with this Thought, she set
herself to observe him more narrowly; and soon
found out, that he went very aukwardly about
his Work; that he sought Opportunities of be∣ing
alone; that he threw himself in her Way
as often as he could, and gazed on her very at∣tentively:
She sometimes fansied she saw him
<PB N="29" REF="45"/>
endeavour to smother a Sigh when he answered
her any Question about his Work; once saw
him leaning against a Tree with his Hands
crossed upon his Breast; and, having lost a
String of small Pearls, which she remembered
he had seen her threading as she sat in one of the
Arbours, was persuaded he had taken it up,
and kept it for the Object of his secret Adora∣tion.</P>
<P>She often wondered, indeed, that she did not
find her Name carved on the Trees, with some
mysterious Expressions of Love; that he was
never discovered lying along the Side of one of
the little Rivulets, increasing the Stream with his
Tears; nor, for three Months that he had lived
there, had ever been sick of a Fever caused by
his Grief, and the Constraint he put upon himself
in not declaring his Passion: But she considered
again, that his Fear of being discovered kept
him from amusing himself with making the
Trees bear the Records of his secret Thoughts,
or of indulging his Melancholy in any Manner
expressive of the Condition of his Soul; and, as
for his not being sick, his Youth, and the
Strength of his Constitution, might, even for a
longer time, bear him up against the Assaults of
a Fever: But he appeared much thinner and
paler than he used to be; and she concluded,
therefore, that he must in time sink under the
Violence of his Passion, or else be forced to de∣clare
it to her; which she considered as a very
great Misfortune; for, not finding in herself
any Disposition to approve his Love, she must ne∣cessarily
banish him from her Presence, for fear
he should have the Presumption to hope, that
<PB N="30" REF="46"/>
Time might do any thing in his Favour: And
it was possible also, that the Sentence she would
be obliged to pronounce, might either cause his
Death, or force him to commit some extrava∣gant
Action, which would discover him to her
Father, who would, perhaps, think her guilty
of holding a secret Correspondence with him.</P>
<P>These Thoughts perplexed her so much, that,
hoping to find some Relief by unburdening her
Mind to <HI>Lucy,</HI> she told her all her Uneasiness.
Ah! said she to her, looking upon <HI>Edward,</HI>
who had just passed them, how unfortunate do
I think myself in being the Cause of that Passion
which makes this illustrious Unknown wear
away his Days in so shameful an Obscurity!
Yes, <HI>Lucy,</HI> pursued she, that <HI>Edward,</HI> whom
you regard as one of my Father's menial Ser∣vants,
is a Person of <HI>sublime Quality,</HI> who sub∣mits
to this Disguise only to have an Opportu∣nity
of seeing me every Day. But why do you
seem so surprised? Is it possible, that you have
not suspected him to be what he is? Has he ne∣ver
unwittingly made any Discovery of himself?
Have you not surprised him in Discourse with
his faithful 'Squire, who, certainly, lurks here∣abouts
to receive his Commands, and is haply
the Confident of his Passion? Has he never en∣tertained
you with any Conversation about me?
Or have you never seen any valuable Jewels
in his Possession by which you suspected him to
be not what he appears?</P>
<P>Truly, Madam, replied <HI>Lucy,</HI> I never took
him for any body else but a simple Gardener;
but now you open my Eyes, methinks I can
find I have been strangely mistaken; for he does
<PB N="31" REF="47"/>
not look like a Man of low Degree; and he
talks quite in another Manner from our Ser∣vants.
I never heard him indeed speak of your
Ladyship, but once; and that was, when he
first saw you walking in the Garden, he asked
our <HI>John,</HI> If you was not the Marquis's Daugh∣ter?
And he said, You was as beautiful as an
Angel. As for sine Jewels, I never saw any;
and I believe he has none; but he has a Watch,
and that looks as if he was something, Madam:
Nor do I remember to have seen him talk with
any Stranger that looked like a 'Squire.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy,</HI> having thus, with her usual Punctuality,
answered every Question her Lady put to her,
proceeded to ask her, What she should say, if
he should beg her to give her a Letter, as the
other Gentleman had done?</P>
<P>You must by no means take it, replied <HI>Ara∣bella:</HI>
My Compassion had before like to have
been fatal to me. If he discovers his Quality to
me, I shall know in what manner to treat him.</P>
<P>They were in this Part of their Discourse,
when a Noise they heard at some Distance,
made <HI>Arabella</HI> bend her Steps to the Place from
whence it proceeded; and, to her infinite Amaze∣ment,
saw the head Gardener, with a Stick he
had in his Hand, give several Blows to the con∣cealed
Hero, who suffered the Indignity with
admirable Patience.</P>
<P>Shocked at seeing a Person of Quality treated
so unworthily, she called out to the Gardener
to hold his Hand; who immediately obeyed;
and <HI>Edward,</HI> seeing the young Lady advance,
sneaked off, with an Air very different from an
<HI>Oroondates.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="48"/>
For what Crime, pray, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> with
a stern Aspect, did you treat the Person I saw
with you so cruelly? He whom you take such
unbecoming Liberties with, may possibly—But
again I ask you, What has he done? You
should make some Allowance for his want of
Skill in the abject Employment he is in at
present.</P>
<P>It is not for his want of Skill, Madam, said the
Gardener, that I corrected him; he knows his
Business very well, if he would mind it; but,
Madam, I have discovered him—</P>
<P>Discovered him, do you say? interrupted
<HI>Arabella:</HI> And has the Knowledge of his Con∣dition
not been able to prevent such Usage? or
rather, Has it been the Occasion of his receiv∣ing
it?</P>
<P>His Conditions are very bad, Madam, re∣turned
the Gardener; and I am afraid are such
as will one Day prove the Ruin of Body and
Soul too. I have for some time suspected he
had bad Designs in his Head; and just now
watched him to the Fish-pond, and prevented
him from—</P>
<P>O dear! interrupted <HI>Lucy,</HI> looking pitifully
on her Lady, whose fair Bosom heaved with
Compassion, I warrant he was going to make
away with himself.</P>
<P>No, resumed the Gardener, smiling at the
Mistake, he was only going to make away with
some of the Carp, which the Rogue had
caught, and intended, I suppose, to sell; but
I threw them into the Water again; and if
your Ladyship had not forbid me, I would have
drubbed him soundly for his Pains.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="49"/>
Fye! fye! interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> out of Breath
with Shame and Vexation, tell me no more of
these idle Tales.</P>
<P>Then, hastily walking on to hide the Blushes
which this strange Accusation of her illustrious
Lover had raised in her Face, she continued for
some time in the greatest Perplexity ima∣ginable.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy,</HI> who followed her, and could not
possibly reconcile what her Lady had been telling
her concerning <HI>Edward,</HI> with the Circumstance
of his stealing the Carp, ardently wished to hear
her Opinion of this Matter; but, seeing her
deeply engaged with her own Thoughts, she
would not venture to disturb her.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> indeed, had been in such a terrible
Consternation, that it was some Time before
she even reconciled Appearances to herself; but,
as she had a most happy Faculty in accommo∣dating
every Incident to her own Wishes and
Conceptions, she examined this Matter so many
different Ways, drew so many Conclusions, and
fansied so many Mysteries in the most indif∣ferent
Actions of the supposed noble Unknown,
that she remained, at last, more than ever
confirmed in the Opinion, that he was some
great Personage, whom her Beauty had forced
to assume an Appearance unworthy of himself:
When <HI>Lucy,</HI> no longer able to keep Silence,
drew off her Attention from those pleasing
Images, by speaking of the Carp-stealing Affair
again.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> whose Confusion returned at that
disagreeable Sound, charged her, in an angry
Tone, never to mention so injurious a Suspi∣cion
<PB N="34" REF="50"/>
any more: For, in fine, said she to her,
do you imagine a Person of his Rank could be
guilty of stealing Carp? Alas! pursued she,
sighing, he had, indeed, some fatal Design;
and, doubtless, would have executed it, had not
this Fellow so luckily prevented him.</P>
<P>But Mr. <HI>Woodbind,</HI> Madam, said <HI>Lucy,</HI> saw
the Carp in his Hand: I wonder what he was
going to do with them.</P>
<P>Still, resumed <HI>Arabella,</HI> extremely chagrined,
still will you wound my Ears with that horrid
Sound? I tell you, obstinate and foolish Wench,
that this unhappy Man went thither to die; and
if he really caught the Fish, it was to conceal
his Design from <HI>Woodbind:</HI> His great Mind
could not suggest to him, that it was possible he
might be suspected of a Baseness like that this
ignorant Fellow accused him of; therefore he
took no Care about it, being wholly possessed
by his despairing Thoughts.</P>
<P>However, Madam, said <HI>Lucy,</HI> your Lady∣ship
may prevent his going to the Fishpond again,
by laying your Commands upon him to live.</P>
<P>I shall do all that I ought, answered <HI>Arabella;</HI>
but my Care for the Safety of other Persons must
not make me forget what I owe to my own.</P>
<P>As she had always imputed Mr. <HI>Hervey</HI>'s fan∣sied
Attempt to carry her away, to the Letter
she had written to him, upon which he had pro∣bably
founded his Hopes of being pardoned for
it, she resolved to be more cautious for the fu∣ture
in giving such Instances of her Compassion;
and was at a great Loss in what manner to com∣fort
her despairing Lover, without raising Ex∣pectations
she had no Inclination to confirm:
<PB N="35" REF="51"/>
But she was delivered from her Perplexity by
the News of his having left the Marquis's Ser∣vice;
which she attributed to some new Design
he had formed to obtain her; and <HI>Lucy,</HI> who
always thought as her Lady did, was of the
same Opinion; tho' it was talked among the
Servants, that <HI>Edward</HI> feared a Discovery of
more Tricks, and resolved not to stay till he
was disgracefully dismissed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which a Mistake, in point of Ceremony,
is rectified.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>ARABELLA</HI> had scarce done thinking of
this last Adventure, when the Marquis
communicated a Piece of Intelligence to her,
which opened a Prospect of an infinite Number
of new ones.</P>
<P>His Nephew, having just returned from his
Travels, was preparing to come and pay him a
Visit in his Retreat; and, as he always designed
to marry <HI>Arabella</HI> to this Youth, of whom he
was extremely fond, he told his Daughter of
the intended Visit of her Cousin, whom she had
not seen since she was eight Years old; and,
for the first time, insinuated his Design of giving
him to her for an Husband.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> whose Delicacy was extremely
shocked at this abrupt Declaration of her <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a∣ther,
could hardly hide her Chagrin; for,
<PB N="36" REF="52"/>
tho' she always intended to marry some time or
other, as all the Heroines had done, yet she
thought such an Event ought to be brought about
with an infinite deal of Trouble; and that it
was necessary she should pass to this State thro'
a great Number of Cares, Disappointments, and
Distresses of various Kinds, like them; that her
Lover should purchase her with his Sword from
a Croud of Rivals; and arrive to the Possession
of her Heart by many Years of Services and Fi∣delity.</P>
<P>The Impropriety of receiving a Lover of a
Father's recommending appeared in its strongest
Light. What Lady in Romance ever married
the Man that was chose for her? In those Cases
the Remonstrances of a Parent are called Perse∣cutions;
obstinate Resistance, Constancy and
Courage; and an Aptitude to dislike the Per∣son
proposed to them, a noble Freedom of Mind
which disdains to love or hate by the Caprice of
others.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> strengthening her own Resolutions
by those Examples of heroic Disobedience, told
her Father, with great Solemnity of Accent,
that she would always obey him in all just and
reasonable Things; and, being persuaded that
he would never attempt to lay any Force upon
her Inclinations, she would endeavour to make
them conformable to his, and receive her Cou∣sin
with that Civility and Friendship due to so
near a Relation, and a Person whom he honoured
with his Esteem.</P>
<P>The Marquis, having had frequent Occasions
of admiring his Daughter's Eloquence, did not
draw any unpleasing Conclusion from the nice
<PB N="37" REF="53"/>
Distinctions she made; and, being perfectly as∣sured
of her Consent whenever he demanded it,
expected the Arrival of his Nephew with great
Impatience.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> whose Thoughts had been fully
employed since this Conversation with her Fa∣ther,
was indulging her Meditations in one of
the most retired Walks in the Garden; when
she was informed by <HI>Lucy,</HI> that her Cousin was
come, and that the Marquis had brought him
into the Garden to look for her.</P>
<P>That Instant they both entered the Walk,
when <HI>Arabella,</HI> prepossessed, as she was, against
any favourable Thoughts of the young <HI>Glan∣ville,</HI>
could not help betraying some Surprize at
the Gracefulness of his Figure.</P>
<P>It must be confessed, said she to her Attendant,
with a Smile, that this Lover my Father has
brought us, is no contemptible Person: Never∣theless
I feel an invincible Repugnance in myself
against receiving him in that Character.</P>
<P>As she finished these Words, the Marquis
came up, and presented Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> to her;
who, saluting her with the Freedom of a Rela∣tion,
gave her a Disgust that shewed itself imme∣diately
in her fair Face, which was overspread
with such a Gloom, that the Marquis was quite
astonished at it. Indeed <HI>Arabella,</HI> who expected
he would hardly have presumed to kiss her Hand,
was so surprised at his Freedom, in attempting
her Lips, that she not only expressed her Indig∣nation
by Frowns, but gave him to understand
he had mortally offended her.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> however, was neither surprised
nor angry at her Resentment; but, imputing it
<PB N="38" REF="54"/>
to her Country Education, endeavoured to railly
her out of her ill Humour; and the Marquis, be∣ing
glad to find a Behaviour, which he thought
proceeded from her Dislike of her Cousin, was
only an Effect of an over-scrupulous Modesty,
told her that Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> had committed no
Offence by saluting her, since that was a Civi∣lity
which was granted to all Strangers at the
first Interview, and therefore could not be re∣fused
to a Relation.</P>
<P>Since the World is so degenerate in it's Cus∣toms
from what it was formerly, said <HI>Arabella,</HI>
with a Smile full of Contempt upon her Cousin,
I am extremely happy in having lived in a Soli∣tude
which has not yet exposed me to the Mor∣tification
of being a Witness to Manners I can∣not
approve; for if every Person I shall meet
with for the future be so deficient in their Re∣spects
to Ladies, as my Cousin is, I shall not care
how much I am secluded from Society.</P>
<P>But, dear Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> interrupted Mr. <HI>Glan∣ville</HI>
gaily, tell me, I beseech you, how I must
behave to please you; for I should be extremely
glad to be honoured with your good Opinion.</P>
<P>The Person, resumed she, whom I must
teach how to acquire my good Opinion, will,
I am afraid, hardly recompense me by his Do∣cility
in learning, for the Pains I should be at in
instructing him.</P>
<P>But, resumed <HI>Glanville,</HI> that I may avoid any
more Occasions of offending you, only let me
know how you would be approached for the fu∣ture.</P>
<P>Since, answered she, there is no Necessity to
renew the Ceremony of introducing you again
<PB N="39" REF="55"/>
to me, I have not a second Affront of that Kind
to apprehend; but I pray tell me, If all Cavaliers
are as presuming as yourself; and if a Relation
of your Sex does not think a modest Embrace
from a Lady a Welcome sufficiently tender<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Heroines, tho' they think a' Kiss of the Hand a great Condescention to a Lover, and never grant it without Blushes and Confusion; yet make no Scruple to embrace him upon every short Absence.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>Nay, Cousin, cried <HI>Glanville</HI> eagerly, I am
now persuaded you are in the Right; an Em∣brace
is certainly to be preferred to a cold Sa∣lute.
What would I give, that the Marquis
would introduce me a second time, that I might
be received with so delightful a Welcome?</P>
<P>The Vivacity with which he spoke this was so
extremely disagreeable to <HI>Arabella,</HI> that she turned
from him abruptly, and, striking into another
Walk, ordered <HI>Lucy</HI> to tell him she commanded
him not to follow her.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> however, who had no No∣tion
of the exact Obedience which was expected
from him, would have gone after her, notwith∣standing
this Prohibition, which <HI>Lucy</HI> delivered
in a most peremptory Manner, after her Lady's
Example: But the Marquis, who had left the
two young People at Liberty to discourse, and
had walked on, that he might not interrupt them,
turning about, and seeing <HI>Glanville</HI> alone, called
him to have some private Discourse with him;
and, for that time, spared <HI>Arabella</HI> the Morti∣fication
of seeing her Commands disobeyed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which a Lover is severely punished for
Faults which the Reader never would
have discovered, if he had not been told.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Marquis, tho' he had resolved to give
<HI>Arabella</HI> to his Nephew, was desirous he
should first receive some impressions of Tender∣ness
for her, before he absolutely declared his
Resolution; and ardently wished he might be
able to overcome that Reluctance which she
seemed to have for Marriage: But, tho' <HI>Glanville</HI>
in a very few Days became passionately in Love
with his charming Cousin, yet she discovered so
strong a Dislike to him, that the Marquis feared it
would be difficult to make her receive him for an
Husband: He observed she took all Opportu∣nities
of avoiding his Conversation; and seemed
always out of Temper when he addressed any
thing to her; but was well enough pleased,
when he discoursed with him; and would listen
to the long Conversations they had together with
great Attention.</P>
<P>The Truth is, she had too much Discernment
not to see Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> had a great deal of
Merit; his Person was perfectly handsome; he
possessed a great Share of Understanding, an
easy Temper, and a Vivacity which charmed
every one, but the insensible <HI>Arabella.</HI></P>
<P>She often wondered, that a Man, who, as
she told her Confident, was Master of so many
fine Qualities, should have a Disposition so little
capable of feeling the Passion of Love, with the
<PB N="41" REF="57"/>
Delicacy and Fervour she expected to inspire;
or, that he, whose Conversation was so pleasing
on every other Subject, should make so poor a
Figure when he entertained her with Matters
of Gallantry. However, added she, I should
be to blame to desire to be beloved by Mr. <HI>Glan∣ville;</HI>
for I am persuaded that Passion would
cause no Reformation in the Coarseness of his
Manners to Ladies, which makes him so disagree∣able
to me, and might possibly increase my
Aversion.</P>
<P>The Marquis, having studied his Nephew's
Looks for several Days, thought he saw Incli∣nation
enough in them for <HI>Arabella,</HI> to make
him receive the Knowlege of his Intention with
Joy: He, therefore, called him into his Closet,
and told him in few Words, that, if his Heart
was not pre-engaged, and his Daughter capable
of making him happy, he resolved to bestow
her upon him, together with all his Estates.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> received this agreeable News
with the strongest Expressions of Gratitude; as∣suring
his Uncle, that Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> of all the
Women he had ever seen, was most agreeable
to his Taste; and that he felt for her all the
Tenderness and Affection his Soul was capable
of.</P>
<P>I am glad of it, my dear Nephew, said the
Marquis, embracing him: I will allow you,
added he smiling, but a few Weeks to court her:
Gain her Heart as soon as you can, and when
you bring me her Consent, your Marriage shall
be solemnized immediately.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> needed not a Repetition of so
agreeable a Command: He left his Uncle's Clo∣set,
<PB N="42" REF="58"/>
with his Heart filled with the Expectation of
his approaching Happiness; and, understanding
<HI>Arabella</HI> was in the Garden, he went to her
with a Resolution to acquaint her with the Per∣mission
her Father had given him to make his
Addresses to her.</P>
<P>He found his fair Cousin, as usual, accompa∣nied
with her Women; and, seeing that, not∣withstanding
his Approach, they still continued
to walk with her, and impatient of the Re∣straint
they laid him under, I beseech you, Cou∣sin,
said he, let me have the Pleasure of walk∣ing
with you alone: What Necessity is there for
always having so many Witnesses of our Con∣versation?
You may retire, said he, speaking
to <HI>Lucy,</HI> and the other Woman; I have some∣thing
to say to your Lady in private.</P>
<P>Stay, I command you, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> blushing
at an Insolence so uncommon, and take Orders
from no one but myself.—I pray you, Sir, pur∣sued
she frowning, What Intercourse of Secrets
is there between you and me, that you expect
I should favour you with a private Conversation?
An Advantage which none of your Sex ever
boasted to have gained from me; and which,
haply, you should be the last upon whom I
should bestow it.</P>
<P>You have the strangest Notions, answered
<HI>Glanville,</HI> smiling at the pretty Anger she disco∣vered:
Certainly you may hold a private Con∣versation
with any Gentleman, without giving
Offence to Decorum; and I may plead a Right
to this Happiness, above any other, since I have
the Honour to be your Relation.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="59"/>
It is not at all surprising, resumed <HI>Arabella</HI>
gravely, that you and I should differ in Opinion
upon this Occasion: I don't remember that ever
we agreed in any thing; and, I am apt to be∣lieve,
we never shall.</P>
<P>Ah! don't say so, Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> interrupted
lie: What a Prospect of Misery you lay before
me! For, if we are always to be opposite to each
other, it is necessary you must hate me as much
as I admire and love you.</P>
<P>These Words, which he accompanied with
a gentle Pressure of her Hand, threw the asto∣nished
<HI>Arabella</HI> into such an Excess of Anger
and Shame, that, for a few Moments, she was
unable to utter a Word.</P>
<P>What a horrid Violation this, of all the
Laws of Gallantry and Respect, which decree
a Lover to suffer whole Years in Silence before
he declares his Flame to the divine Object that
causes it; and then with awful Tremblings, and
submissive Prostrations at the Feet of the of∣fended
Fair!</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> could hardly believe her Senses when
she heard a Declaration, not only made with∣out
the usual Forms, but also, that the presum∣tuous
Criminal waited for her Answer, without
seeming to have any Apprehension of the Pu∣nishment
to which he was to be doomed; and
that, instead of deprecating her Wrath, he
looked with a smiling Wonder upon her Eyes,
as if he did not fear their Lightenings would
strike him dead.</P>
<P>Indeed, it was scarce possible for him to help smi∣ling,
and wondering too, at the extraordinary
Notion of <HI>Arabella;</HI> for, as soon as he had pro∣nounced
<PB N="44" REF="60"/>
those fatal Words, she started back two
or three Steps; cast a Look at him full of the
highest Indignation; and, lifting up her fine
Eyes to Heaven, seemed, in the Language of
Romance, to accuse the Gods for subjecting
her to so cruel an Indignity.</P>
<P>The Tumult of her Thoughts being a little
settled, she turned again towards <HI>Glanville;</HI> whose
Countenance expressing nothing of that Confu∣sion
and Anxiety common to an Adorer in so
critical a Circumstance, her Rage returned with
greater Violence than ever.</P>
<P>If I do not express all the Resentment your In∣solence
has filled me with, said she to him, af∣fecting
more Scorn than Anger, 'tis because I
hold you too mean for my Resentment; but ne∣ver
hope for my Pardon for your presumptuous
Confession of a Passion I could almost despise my∣self
for inspiring. If it be true that you love me,
go and find your Punishment in that Absence to
which I doom you; and never hope I will suffer
a Person in my Presence, who has affronted me
in the manner you have done.</P>
<P>Saying this, she walked away, making a Sign
to him not to follow her.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who was at first disposed to
laugh at the strange Manner in which she re∣ceived
his Expressions of Esteem for her, found
something, so extremely haughty and contemp∣tuous
in the Speech she had made, that he was
almost mad with Vexation.</P>
<P>As he had no Notion of his Cousin's heroic
Sentiments, and had never read Romances, he
was quite ignorant of the Nature of his Offence;
and, supposing the Scorn she had expressed for
<PB N="45" REF="61"/>
him was founded upon the Difference of their
Rank and Fortune, his Pride was so sensibly
mortified at that Thought, and at her so inso∣lently
forbiding him her Presence, that he was
once inclined to shew his Resentment of such un∣genteel
Usage, by quitting the Castle without
taking Leave even of the Marquis, who, he
thought, could not be ignorant of the Recep∣tion
he was likely to meet with from his Daugh∣ter;
and ought to have guarded him against it,
if he really meant him so well as he seemed to
do.</P>
<P>As he was extremely violent and hasty in his
Resolutions, and nicely sensible of the least Af∣front,
he was not in a Condition to reason justly
upon the Marquis's Conduct in this Affair; and
while he was fluctuating with a thousand differ∣ent
Resolutions, <HI>Lucy</HI> came to him with a Bil∣let
from her Lady, which she delivered without
staying till he opened it; and was superscribed
in this Manner:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>Arabella, To the most presumptuous Man in
the World—</HEAD>
<P>YOU seem to acknowlege so little Respect
and Deference for the Commands of a
Lady, that I am afraid it will be but too neces∣sary
to reiterate that, which, at parting, I laid
upon you: Know then, that I absolutely insist
upon your repairing, in the only manner you
are able, the Affront you have put upon me;
which is, by never appearing before me again.
If you think proper to confine me to my Cham∣ber,
by continuing here any longer, you will
<PB N="46" REF="62"/>
add Disobedience to the Crime by which you
have already mortally offended</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Arabella.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>The Superscription of this Letter, and the un∣common
Style of it, persuaded Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI>
that what he had been foolish enough to resent
as an Affront, was designed as a Jest, and
meant to divert him as well as herself: He exa∣mined
her Behaviour again, and wondered at
his Stupidity in not discovering it before. His
Resentment vanishing immediately, he returned
to the House; and went, without Ceremony,
to <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Apartment, which he entered be∣fore
she perceived him, being in a profound
Musing at one of the Windows: The Noise he
made, in approaching her, obliged her at last
to look up; when, starting, as if she had seen a
Basilisk, she flew to her Closet, and, shutting the
Door with great Violence, commanded him to
leave her Chamber immediately.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> still supposing her in Jest, in∣treated
her to open the Door; but, finding she
continued obstinate, Well, said he, going away,
I shall be revenged on you some time hence,
and make you repent the Tricks you play me
now.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> not being able to imagine any thing,
by these Words he spoke in Raillery, but that
he really, in the Spite and Anguish of his Heart,
threatened her with executing some terrible En∣terprize;
she did not doubt, but he either in∣tended
to carry her away; or, thinking her
Aversion to him proceeded from his having a
Rival happy enough to be esteemed by her, those
<PB N="47" REF="63"/>
mysterious Words he had uttered related to his
Design of killing him; so that as she knew, he
could discover no Rival to wreak his Revenge
upon, she feared, that, at once to satisfy that
Passion as well as his Love, he would make him∣self
Master of her Liberty: For, in fine, said she
to <HI>Lucy,</HI> to whom she communicated all her
Thoughts, have I not every thing to apprehend
from a Man, who knows so little how to treat
my Sex with the Respect which is our Due;
and who, after having, contrary to the timorous
Nature of that Passion, insulted me with a free
Declaration of Love, treated my Commands
with the utmost Contempt by appearing before
me again; and even threatens me with the Re∣venge
he is meditating at this Moment?</P>
<P>Had Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> been present, and heard
the terrible Misfortunes which she presaged from
the few Words he had jestingly spoke, he would
certainly have made her quite furious, by the
Diversion her Mistake would have afforded him.
But the more she reflected on his Words, the
more she was persuaded of the terrible Purpose
of them.</P>
<P>'Twas in vain to acquaint her Father with
the Reasons she had for disliking his Choice: His
Resolution was fixed, and if she did not volun∣tarily
conform to it, she exposed herself to the
Attempts of a violent and unjust Lover, who
would either prevail upon the Marquis to lay
a Force upon her Inclinations, or make himself
Master of her Person, and never cease perse∣cuting
her, till he had obliged her to give him
her Hand.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="64"/>
Having reasoned herself into a perfect Con∣viction
that all these things must necessarily hap∣pen,
she thought it both just and reasonable to
provide for her own Security, by a speedy Flight.
The Want of a Precedent, indeed, for an Action
of this Nature, held her a few Moments in Sus∣pense;
for she did not remember to have read
of any Heroine that voluntarily left her Father's
House, however persecuted she might be; but she
considered, that there was not any of the Ladies
in Romances, in the same Circumstances with
herself who was without a favoured Lover, for
whose sake it might have been believed she had
made an Elopement, which would have been
highly prejudicial to her Glory; and, as there
was no Foundation for any Suspicion of that
Kind in her Case, she thought there was no∣thing
to hinder her from withdrawing from a ty∣rannical
Exertion of parental Authority, and the
secret Machinations of a Lover, whose Aim was
to take away her Liberty, either by obliging her
to marry him, or by making her a Prisoner.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Contains several Incidents, in which the
Reader is expected to be extremely inte∣rested.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>ARABELLA</HI> had spent some Hours in her
Closet, revolving a thousand different
Stratagems to escape from the Misfortune that
<PB N="49" REF="65"/>
threatened her, when she was interrupted by
<HI>Lucy,</HI> who, after desiring Admittance, informed
her, that the Marquis, having rode out to take
the Air that Evening, had fallen from his Horse
and received some Hurt; that he was gone to
Bed, and desired to see her.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> hearing her Father was indisposed,
ran to him, excessively alarmed; and reflecting
on the Resolution she had just before taken, of
leaving him, which aggravated her Concern,
she came to his Bedside with her Eyes swiming in
Tears. Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> was sitting near him; but,
rising at her Appearance to give her his Chair,
which she accepted without taking any Notice
of him, he stood at some Distance contem∣plating
her Face, to which Sorrow had given
so many Charms, that he gazed on her with an
Eagerness and Delight that could not escape her
Observation.</P>
<P>She blushed excessively at the passionate Looks
he gave her; and, finding the Marquis's Indis∣position
not considerable enough to oblige her
to a constant Attendance at his Bed-side, she took
the first Opportunity of returning to her Cham∣ber;
but, as she was going out, <HI>Glanville</HI> pre∣sented
his Hand to lead her up Stairs: Which
she scornfully refusing;</P>
<P>Sure, Cousin, said he, a little piqued, you
are not disposed to carry on your ill-natured Jest
any further?</P>
<P>If you imagined I jested with you, said <HI>Ara∣bella,</HI>
I am rather to accuse the Slowness of your
Understanding, for your persisting in treating
me thus freely, than the Insolence I first im∣puted
it to: But, whatever is the Cause of it,
<PB N="50" REF="66"/>
I now tell you again, that you have extremely
offended me; and, if my Father's Illness did
not set Bounds to my Resentment at present, I
would make you know, that I would not suffer
the Injury you do me, so patiently.</P>
<P>Since you would have me to believe you are se∣rious,
replied <HI>Glanville,</HI> be pleased to let me
know what Offence it is you complain of; for
I protest I am quite at a Loss to understand
you.</P>
<P>Was it not enough, resumed <HI>Arabella,</HI> to af∣front
me with an insolent Declaration of your
Passion, but you must also, in Contempt of my
Commands to the contrary, appear before me
again, pursue me to my Chamber, and use the
most brutal Menaces to me?</P>
<P>Hold, pray, Madam, interrupted <HI>Glanville,</HI>
and suffer me to ask you, If it is my Presump∣tion,
in declaring myself your Admirer, that
you are so extremely offended at?</P>
<P>Doubtless it is, Sir, answered <HI>Arabella;</HI> and
such a Presumption, as, without the aggravating
Circumstances you have since added to it, is suf∣ficient
to make me always your Enemy.</P>
<P>I beg Pardon, returned Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> gravely,
for that Offence; and also, for staying any
longer in a House, which you have, so gen∣teelly,
turned me out of.</P>
<P>My Pardon, Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> resumed she, is
not so easily gained: Time, and your Repent∣ance,
may, indeed, do much towards obtaining
it.</P>
<P>Saying this, she made a Sign to him to retire;
for he had walked up with her to her Chamber:
But, finding he did not obey her, for really he
<PB N="51" REF="67"/>
was quite unacquainted with these Sorts of dumb
Commands, she hastily retired to her Closet, lest
he should attempt to move her Pity, by any Ex∣pressions
of Despair for the cruel Banishment she
had doomed him to.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> seeing she had shut herself up
in her Closet, left her Chamber, and retired to
his own, more confounded than ever at the Be∣haviour
of his Cousin.</P>
<P>Her bidding him so peremptorily to leave the
House, would have equally persuaded him of
her Ignorance and Ill-breeding, had not the Ele∣gance
of her Manners, in every other respect,
proved the contrary: Nor was it possible to doubt
she had a great Share of Understanding; since
her Conversation, singular as some of her Sen∣timents
seemed to him, was far superior to most
other Ladies. Therefore, he concluded, the
Affront he had received, proceeded from her
Disdain to admit the Addresses of any Person,
whose Quality was inferior to hers; which,
probably, was increased to some particular Dis∣like
she had to his Person.</P>
<P>His Honour would not permit him to make
Use of that Advantage her Father's Authority
could give him; and, wholly engrossed by his
Resentment of the Usage he had received from
her, he resolved to set out for <HI>London</HI> the next
Day without seeing the Marquis, from whom
he was apprehensive of some Endeavours to de∣tain
him.</P>
<P>Having taken this Resolution, he ordered his
Servant to have the Horses ready early in the
Morning; and, without taking any Notice of
his Intention, he left the Castle, riding, as fast
<PB N="52" REF="68"/>
as possible, to the next Stage, from whence he
wrote to his Uncle; and, dispatching a Messen∣ger
with his Letter, held on his Way to <HI>Lon∣don.</HI></P>
<P>The Marquis, being pretty well recovered
from his Indisposition by a good Night's Rest,
sent for Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> in the Morning, to walk
with him, as was his Custom, in the Garden;
but, hearing he had rode out, tho' he imagined
it was only to take the Air, yet he could not
help accusing him, in his own Thoughts, of a
little Neglect; for which he resolved to chide
him, when he returned: But his long Stay fill∣ing
him with some Surprize, he was beginning
to express his Fears that something had befallen
him, to <HI>Arabella,</HI> who was then with him; when
a Servant presented him the Letter, which Mr.
<HI>Glanville</HI>'s Messenger had that Moment brought.</P>
<P>The Marquis casting his Eyes on the Di∣rection,
and knowing his Nephew's Hand, Bless
me, cried he, extremely surprised, What can
this mean? <HI>Bella,</HI> added he, here's a Letter
from your Cousin.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> at these Words, started up; and,
preventing her Father, with a respectful Action,
from opening it, I beseech you, my Lord, said
she, before you read this Letter, suffer me to
assure you, that, if it contains any thing fatal,
I am not at all accessary to it: 'Tis true I have
banished my Cousin, as a Punishment for the
Offence he was guilty of towards me; but, Hea∣ven
is my Witness, I did not design his Death;
and if he has taken any violent Resolution against
himself, he has greatly exceeded my Com∣mands.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="69"/>
The Marquis, whose Surprize was considera∣bly
increased by these Words, hastily broke
open the Letter, which she perceiving, hurried
out of the Room; and, locking herself up in
her Closet, began to bewail the Effect of her
Charms, as if she was perfectly assured of her
Cousin's Death.</P>
<P>The Marquis, however, who, from Lady
<HI>Bella</HI>'s Exclamation, had prepared himself for the
Knowlege of some very extraordinary Accident,
was less surprised, than he would otherwise have
been, at the Contents; which were as follow:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS my leaving your House so abruptly will
certainly make me appear guilty of a most
unpardonable Rudeness, I cannot dispense with
myself from acquainting your Lordship with the
Cause; though, to spare the Reproaches Lady
<HI>Bella</HI> will probably cast on me for doing so, I
could wish you knew it by any other Means.</P>
<P>But, my Lord, I value your Esteem too much
to hazard the Loss of it by suffering you to ima∣gine,
that I am capable of doing any thing to
displease you. Lady <HI>Bella</HI> was pleased to order
me to stay no longer in the House; and menaced
me with some very terrible Usage, if I disobeyed
her: She used so many other contemptuous Ex∣pressions
to me, that, I am persuaded, I shall
never be so happy as to possess the Honour you
designed for,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE> <SIGNED>Your most obedient, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
Charles Glanville.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="54" REF="70"/>
When the Marquis had read this Letter, he
went to his Daughter's Apartment with an In∣tention
to chide her severely for her Usage of his
Nephew; but, seeing her come to meet him
with her Eyes bathed in Tears, he insensibly
lost some Part of his Resentment.</P>
<P>Alas! my Lord, said she, I know you come
prepared to load me with Reproaches, upon my
Cousin's Account; but, I beseech your Lord∣ship,
do not aggravate my Sorrows: Tho' I ba∣nished
Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> I did not desire his Death;
and, questionless, if he knew how I <HI>resent</HI> it,
his Ghost would be satisfied with the Sacrifice
I make him.</P>
<P>The Marquis, not being able to help smiling
at this Conceit, which he saw had so strongly
possessed her Imagination, that she had no sort
of Doubt but that her Cousin was dead, asked
her, If she really believed Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> loved
her well enough to die with Grief at her ill Usage
of him?</P>
<P>If, said she, he loves me not well enough to
die for me, he certainly loves me but little; and
I am the less obliged to him.</P>
<P>But I desire to know, interrupted the Mar∣quis,
For what Crime it was you took the Li∣berty
to banish him from my House?</P>
<P>I banished him, my Lord, resumed she, for
his Presumption in telling me he loved me.</P>
<P>That Presumption, as you call it, tho' I
know not for what Reason, said the Marquis,
was authorized by me: Therefore, know, <HI>Bella,</HI>
that I not only permit him to love you, but I
also expect you should endeavour to return his
Affection; and look upon him as the Man
<PB N="55" REF="71"/>
whom I design for your Husband: There's his
Letter, pursued he, putting it into her Hand.
I blush for the Rudeness you have been guilty
of; but endeavour to repair it, by a more ob∣liging
Behaviour for the future: I am going to
send after him immediately to prevail upon to
return: Therefore, write him an Apology, I
charge you; and have it done by the Time my
Messenger is ready to set out.</P>
<P>Saying this, he went out of the Room; and
<HI>Arabella</HI> eagerly opened the Letter; and, finding
it in a Style so different from what she expected,
her Dislike of him returned with more Violence
than ever.</P>
<P>Ah! the Traitor! said she aloud, Is it thus
that he endeavours to move my Compassion?
How greatly did I over-rate his Affection, when
I imagined his Despair was capable of killing
him? Disloyal Man! pursued she, walking
about, Is it by Complaints to my Father that
thou expectest to succeed? And dost thou ima∣gine
the Heart of <HI>Arabella</HI> is to be won by Vio∣lence
and Injustice?</P>
<P>In this manner she wasted the Time allotted
for her to write; and, when the Marquis sent
for her Letter, having no Intention to comply,
she went to his Chamber, conjuring him not to
oblige her to a Condescension so unworthy of
her.</P>
<P>The Marquis, being now excessively angry
with her, rose up in a Fury, and, leading her
to his Writing-Desk, ordered her, instantly, to
write to her Cousin.</P>
<P>If I must write, my Lord, said she, sobbing,
pray be so good as to dictate what I must say.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="72"/>
Apologize for your rude Behaviour, said the
Marquis; and desire him, in the most obliging
manner you can, to return.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> seeing there was a necessity for obey∣ing,
took up the Pen, and wrote the following
Billet:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>The unfortunate Arabella, to the most ungenerous
Glanville.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not by the Power I have over you, that
I command you to return, for I disclaim any
Empire over so unworthy a Subject; but, since
it is my Father's Pleasure I should invite you
back, I must let you know, that I repeal your
Banishment, and expect you will immediately
return with the Messenger who brings this; how∣ever,
to spare your Acknowlegements, know,
that it is in Obedience to my Father's absolute
Commands, that you receive this Mandate
from</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Arabella.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Having finished this Billet, she gave it to the
Marquis to read; who, finding a great deal of
his own Haughtiness of Temper in it, could not
resolve to check her for a Disposition so like his
own: Yet he told her, her Stile was very uncom∣mon:
And pray, added he, smiling, who taught
you to superscribe your Letters thus, <Q>The un∣fortunate
<HI>Arabella,</HI> to the most ungenerous
<HI>Glanville?</HI></Q> Why, <HI>Bella,</HI> this Superscription is
wholly calculated for the Bearer's Information:
But come, alter it immediately; for I don't
choose my Messenger should know, that you
<PB N="57" REF="73"/>
are unfortunate, or that my Nephew is unge∣nerous.</P>
<P>Pray, my Lord, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> content
yourself with what I have already done in Obe∣dience
to your Commands, and suffer my Letter
to remain as it is: Methinks it is but reasonable
I should express some little Resentment at the
Complaint my Cousin has been pleased to make
to you against me; nor can I possibly make my
Letter more obliging, without being guilty of
an unpardonable Meanness.</P>
<P>You are a strange Girl, replied the Marquis,
taking the Letter, and inclosing it in one from
himself; in which he earnestly intreated his
Nephew to return, threatening him with his
Displeasure, if he disobeyed; and assuring him,
that his Daughter would receive him as well as
he could possibly desire.</P>
<P>The Messenger being dispatched, with Orders
to ride Post, and overtake the young Gentle∣man,
he obeyed his Orders so well, that he came
up with him at—, where he intended to lodge
that Night.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who expected his Uncle would
make use of some Methods to recal him, opened
his Letter without any great Emotion; but see∣ing
another inclosed, his Heart leaped to his
Mouth, not doubting but it was a Letter from
<HI>Arabella;</HI> but the Contents surprised him so
much, that he hardly knew whether he ought to
look upon them as an Invitation to return, or
a new Affront, her Words were so distant and
haughty. The Superscription being much the
same with a Billet he had received from her in
the Garden, which had made him conclude her
<PB N="58" REF="74"/>
in Jest, he knew not what to think of it: One
would swear this dear Girl's Head is turned,
said he to himself, if she had not more <HI>Wit</HI> than
her whole Sex besides.</P>
<P>After reading <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Letter several times,
he at last opened his Uncle's; and, seeing the
pressing Instances he made him to return, he
resolved to obey; and the next Morning set out
for the Castle.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> during the time her Cousin was
expected, appeared so melancholy and reserved,
that the Marquis was extremely uneasy: You
have never, said he to her, disobeyed me in any
one Action of your Life; and I may with reason
expect you will conform to my Will in the Choice
I have made of a Husband for you, since it is
impossible to make any Objection either to his
Person or Mind; and, being the Son of my
Sister, he is certainly not unworthy of you, tho'
he has not a Title.</P>
<P>My first Wish, my Lord, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> is
to live single, not being desirous of entering into
any Engagement which may hinder my Solici∣tude
and Cares, and lessen my Attendance, upon
the best of Fathers, who, till now, has always
most tenderly complied with my Inclinations
in every thing: But if it is your absolute Com∣mand,
that I should marry, give me not to one
who, tho' he has the Honour to be allied to you,
has neither merited your Esteem, or my Favour,
by any Action worthy of his Birth, or the Pas∣sion
he pretends to have for me; for, in fine,
my Lord, by what Services has he deserved the
Distinction with which you honour him? Has
he ever delivered you from any considerable
<PB N="59" REF="75"/>
Danger? Has he saved your Life, and hazarded
his own, for you, upon any Occasion whatever?
Has he merited my Esteem, by his Sufferings,
Fidelity, and Respect; or, by any great and
generous Action, given me a Testimony of his
Love, which should oblige me to reward him
with my Affection? Ah! my Lord, I beseech
you, think not so unworthily of your Daughter,
as to bestow her upon one who has done so
little to deserve her: If my Happiness be dear
to you, do not precipitate me into a State from
whence you cannot recal me, with a Person
whom I can never affect.</P>
<P>She would have gone on, but the Marquis in∣terrupted
her sternly: I'll hear no more, said
he, of your foolish and ridiculous Objections;
What Stuff is this you talk of? What Service
am I to expect from my Nephew? And by
what Sufferings is he to merit your Esteem?
Assure yourself, <HI>Arabella,</HI> continued he, that
I will never pardon you, if you presume to treat
my Nephew in the Manner you have done: I
perceive you have no real Objection to make to
him; therefore I expect you will endeavour to
obey me without Reluctance; for, since you
seem to be so little acquainted with what will
most conduce to your own Happiness, you must
not think it strange, if I insist upon directing
your Choice in the most important Business of
your Life.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> was going to reply; but the Marquis
ordered her to be silent; and she went to her
own Apartment in so much Affliction, that she
thought her Misfortunes were not exceeded by
any she had ever read.</P>

<PB N="60" REF="76"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which a logical Argument is unseason∣ably
interrupted.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Marquis was also extremely uneasy
at her Obstinacy: He desired nothing more
ardently than to marry her to his Nephew; but
he could not resolve to force her Consent; and,
however determined he appeared to her, yet,
in Reality, he intended only to use Persuasions
to effect what he desired; and, from the natural
Sweetness of her Temper, he was sometimes
not without Hopes, that she might, at last, be
prevailed upon to comply.</P>
<P>His Nephew's Return restored him to Part of
his usual Tranquillity: After he had gently chid
him for suffering himself to be so far transported
with his Resentment at the little Humours of a
Lady, as to leave his House, without acquaint∣ing
him, he bid him go to <HI>Arabella,</HI> and en∣deavour
to make his Peace with her.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> accordingly went to her Apart∣ment,
resolving to oblige her to come to some
Explanation with him concerning the Offence
she complained of; but that fair incensed Lady,
who had taken Shelter in her Closet, ordered
<HI>Lucy</HI> to tell him she was indisposed, and could
not see him.</P>
<P><HI>Glanville,</HI> however, comforted himself for
this Disappointment by the Hopes of seeing her
at Supper; and accordingly she came, when the
Supper-Bell rung, and, making a very cool Com∣pliment
to her Cousin, placed herself at Table:
<PB N="61" REF="77"/>
The soft Languor that appeared in her Eyes,
gave such an additional Charm to one of the
loveliest Faces in the World, that <HI>Glanville,</HI>
who sat opposite to her, could not help gazing
on her with a very particular Attention; he
often spoke to her, and asked her trifling Ques∣tions,
for the sake of hearing the Sound of her
Voice, which Sorrow had made inchantingly
sweet.</P>
<P>When Supper was over, she would have re∣tired;
but the Marquis desired her to stay and
entertain her Cousin, while he went to look over
some Dispatches he had received from <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> blushed with Anger at this Com∣mand;
but, not daring to disobey, she kept her
Eyes fixed on the Ground, as if she dreaded to
hear something that would displease her.</P>
<P>Well, Cousin, said <HI>Glanville,</HI> tho' you desire
to have no Empire over so unworthy a Subject
as myself, yet I hope you are not displeased at
my returning, in Obedience to your Commands.</P>
<P>Since I am not allowed any Will of my own,
said she, sighing, it matters not whether I am
pleased, or displeased; nor is it of any Conse∣quence
to you to know.</P>
<P>Indeed but it is, Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> interrupted he;
for if I knew how to please you, I would never,
if I could help it, offend: Therefore, I beg you,
tell me how I have disobliged you; for, certainly,
you have treated me as harshly as if I had been
guilty of some very terrible Offence.</P>
<P>You had the Boldness, said she, to talk to
me of Love; and you well know that Persons
of my Sex and Quality are not permitted to
<PB N="62" REF="78"/>
listen to such Discourses; and if, for that Of∣fence,
I banished you my Presence, I did no
more than Decency required of me; and which
I would yet do, were I Mistress of my own
Actions.</P>
<P>But is it possible, Cousin, said <HI>Glanville,</HI> that
you can be angry with any one for loving you?
Is that a Crime of so high a Nature as to merit
an eternal Banishment from your Presence?</P>
<P>Without telling you, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> blushing,
whether I am angry at being loved, 'tis sufficient
you know, that I will not pardon the Man who
shall have the Presumption to tell me he loves me.</P>
<P>But, Madam, interrupted <HI>Glanville,</HI> if the
Person who tells you he loves you, be of a
Rank not beneath you, I conceive you are not
at all injured by the favourable Sentiments he
feels for you; and, tho' you are not disposed to
make any Returns to his Passion, yet you are cer∣tainly
obliged to him for his good Opinion.</P>
<P>Since Love is not voluntary, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI>
I am not obliged to any Person for loving me;
for, questionless, if he could help it, he would.</P>
<P>If it is not a voluntary Favour, interrupted
<HI>Glanville,</HI> it is not a voluntary Offence; and, if
you do not think yourself obliged by the one,
neither are you at Liberty to be offended with
the other.</P>
<P>The Question, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> is not whether
I ought to be offended at being loved, but
whether it is not an Offence to be told I am so.</P>
<P>If there is nothing criminal in the Passion it∣self,
Madam, resumed <HI>Glanville,</HI> certainly there
can be no Crime in declaring it.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="79"/>
However specious your Arguments may appear,
interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> I am persuaded it is an
unpardonable Crime to tell a Lady you love
her; and, tho' I had nothing else to plead, yet
the Authority of Custom is sufficient to prove it.</P>
<P>Custom, Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> said <HI>Glanville,</HI> smiling▪
is wholly on my Side; for the Ladies are so far
from being displeased at the Addresses of their
Lovers, that their chiefest Care is to gain them,
and their greatest Triumph to hear them talk of
their Passion: So, Madam, I hope you'll allow
that Argument has no Force.</P>
<P>I don't know, answered <HI>Arabella,</HI> what Sort
of Ladies there are who allow such unbe∣coming
Liberties, but I am certain, that <HI>Statira,
Parisatis, Clelia, Mandana,</HI> and all the illustri∣ous
Heroines of Antiquity, whom it is a Glory
to resemble, would never admit of such Dis∣courses.</P>
<P>Ah for Heaven's sake, Cousin, interrupted
<HI>Glanville,</HI> endeavouring to stifle a Laugh, do not
suffer yourself to be governed by such antiquated
Maxims! The World is quite different to what
it was in those Days; and the Ladies in this
Age would as soon follow the Fashions of the
<HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Ladies, as mimick their
Manners; and I believe they would become one
as ill as the other.</P>
<P>I am sure, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> the World is not
more virtuous now than it was in their Days,
and there is good Reason to believe it is not
much wiser; and I don't see why the Manners
of this Age are to be preferred to those of for∣mer
ones, unless they are wiser and better:
However, I cannot be persuaded, that Things
<PB N="64" REF="80"/>
are as you say, and that when I am a little better
acquainted with the World, I shall find as many
Persons who resemble <HI>Oroondates, Artaxerxes,</HI>
and the illustrious Lovers of <HI>Clelia,</HI> as those
who are like <HI>Tiribases, Artaxes,</HI> and the pre∣suming
and insolent <HI>Glanville.</HI></P>
<P>By the Epithets you give me Madam, said
<HI>Glanville,</HI> I find you have placed me in very
bad Company: But pray, Madam, if the
illustrious Lover of <HI>Clelia</HI> had never discovered
his Passion, how would the World have come
to the Knowledge of it?</P>
<P>He did not discover his Passion, Sir, resumed
<HI>Arabella,</HI> till, by the Services he did the noble
<HI>Clelius,</HI> and his incomparable Daughter, he
could plead some Title to their Esteem: He se∣veral
times preserved the Life of that renowned
<HI>Roman;</HI> delivered the beautiful <HI>Clelia</HI> when
she was a Captive; and, in fine, conferred so
many Obligations upon them, and all their
Friends, as he might well expect to be par∣doned
by the divine <HI>Clelia</HI> for daring to love
her. Nevertheless, she used him very harshly,
when he first declared his Passion, and banished
him also from her Presence; and it was a long
time before she could prevail upon herself to
compassionate his Sufferings.</P>
<P>The Marquis coming in interrupted <HI>Ara∣bella;</HI>
upon which she took Occasion to retire;
leaving <HI>Glanville</HI> more captivated with her than
ever.</P>
<P>He found her Usage of him was grounded
upon Examples she thought it her Duty to fol∣low;
and, strange as her Notions of Life ap∣peared,
yet they were supported with so much
<PB N="65" REF="81"/>
Wit and Delicacy, that he could not help ad∣miring
her, while he foresaw, the Oddity of her
Humour would throw innumerable Difficulties
in his Way, before he should be able to obtain
her.</P>
<P>However, as he was really passionately in
Love with her, he resolved to accommodate
himself, as much as possible, to her Taste, and
endeavour to gain her Heart by a Behaviour
most agreeable to her: He therefore assumed an
Air of great Distance and Respect; never men∣tioned
his Affection, nor the Intentions of her
Father in his Favour; and the Marquis, ob∣serving
his Daughter conversed with him with
less Reluctance than usual, leaving to Time,
and the Merit of his Nephew, to dispose her to
comply with his Desires, resolved not to inter∣pose
his Authority in an Affair upon which her
own Happiness so much depended.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which the Reader will find a Specimen
of the true Pathetic, in a Speech of
Oroondates.—The Adventure of the
Books.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>ARABELLA</HI> saw the Change in her
Cousin's Behaviour with a great deal of
Satisfaction; for she did not doubt but his Passion
was as strong as ever; but that he forbore,
thro' Respect, from entertaining her with any
<PB N="66" REF="82"/>
Expressions of it: Therefore she now conversed
with him with the greatest Sweetness and Com∣plaisance:
She would walk with him for several
Hours in the Garden, leaning upon his Arm;
and charmed him to the last Degree of Admira∣tion
by the agreeable Sallies of her Wit, and
her fine Reasoning upon every Subject he pro∣posed.</P>
<P>It was with the greatest Difficulty he restrain∣ed
himself from telling her a Thousand times a
Day that he loved her to Excess, and conjuring
her to give her Consent to her Father's Designs
in his Favour: But, tho' he could get over
his Fears of offending her, yet it was impossible
to express any Sentiments of this Nature to her,
without having her Women Witnesses of his
Discourse; for, when he walked with her in
the Garden, <HI>Lucy,</HI> and another Attendant, al∣ways
followed her: If he sat with her in her
own Chamber, her Women were always at one
End of it: And, when they were both in the
Marquis's Apartment, where her Women did
not follow her, poor <HI>Glanville</HI> found himself
embarrassed by his Presence; for, conceiving
his Nephew had Opportunities enough of talk∣ing
to his Daughter in private, he always partook
of their Conversation.</P>
<P>He passed some Weeks in this Manner, ex∣tremely
chagrined at the little Progress he made;
and was beginning to be heartily weary of the
Constraint he laid upon himself, when <HI>Arabella,</HI>
one Day, furnished him, without designing it,
with an Opportunity of talking to her on the
Subject he wished for.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="83"/>
When I reflect, said she, laughing, upon the
Difference there was between us some Days
ago, and the Familiarity in which we live at
present, I cannot imagine by what means you
have arrived to a good Fortune you had so little
Reason to expect; for, in fine, you have given
me no Signs of Repentance for the Fault you
committed, which moved me to banish you;
and I am not certain whether, in conversing
with you in the manner I do, I give you not as
much Reason to find Fault with my too great
Easiness, as you did me to be displeased with
your Presumption.</P>
<P>Since, returned <HI>Glanville,</HI> I have not persisted
in the Commission of those Faults which dis∣pleased
you, what greater Signs of Repentance
can you desire, than this Reformation in my Be∣haviour?</P>
<P>But Repentance ought to precede Reforma∣tion,
replied <HI>Arabella;</HI> otherwise, there is great
room to suspect it is only feigned: And a sincere
Repentance shews itself in such visible Marks,
that one can hardly be deceived in that which is
genuine. I have read of many indiscreet Lovers,
who not succeeding in their Addresses, have
pretended to repent, and acted as you do; that
is, without giving any Signs of Contrition for
the Fault they had committed, have eat and
slept well, never lost their Colour, or grew one
bit thinner, by their Sorrow; but contented
themselves with saying they repented; and,
without changing thetr Disposition to renew
their Fault, only concealed their Intention, for
fear of losing any favourable Opportunity of
committing it again: But true Repentance, as
<PB N="68" REF="84"/>
I was saying, not only produces Reformation,
but the Person who is possessed of it voluntarily
punishes himself for the Faults he has been
guilty of. Thus <HI>Mazares,</HI> deeply repenting of
the Crime his Passion for the divine <HI>Manda<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a</HI>
had forced him to commit; as a Punishment,
obliged himself to follow the Fortune of his
glorious Rival; obey all his Commands; and,
fighting under his Banners, assist him to gain
the Possession of his adored Mistress. Such a
glorious Instance of Self-denial was, indeed, a
sufficient Proof of his Repentance; and infi∣nitely
more convincing than the Silence he im∣posed
upon himself with respect to his Passion.</P>
<P><HI>Oroondates,</HI> to punish himself for his Pre∣sumption,
in daring to tell the admirable <HI>Statira,</HI>
that he loved her, resolved to die, to expiate
his Crime; and, doubtless, would have done so,
if his fair Mistress, at the Intreaty of her Bro∣ther,
had not commanded him to live.</P>
<P>But pray, Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> interrupted <HI>Glanville,</HI>
were not these Gentlemen happy at last in the
Possession of their Mistresses?</P>
<P>Doubtless they were, Sir, resumed she; but
it was not till after numberless Misfortunes, in∣finite
Services, and many dangerous Adventures,
in which their Fidelity was put to the strongest
Trials imaginable.</P>
<P>I am glad, however, said <HI>Glanville,</HI> that the
Ladies were not insensible; for, since you do
not disapprove of their Compassion for their
Lovers, it is to be hoped you will not be always
as inexorable as you are now.</P>
<P>When I shall be so fortunate, interrupted she,
to meet with a Lover who shall have as pure
<PB N="69" REF="85"/>
and perfect a Passion for me, as <HI>Oroondates</HI> had
for <HI>Statira;</HI> and give me as many glorious
Proofs of his Constancy and Affection, doubt∣less
I shall not be ungrateful: But, since I have
not the Merits of <HI>Statira,</HI> I ought not to pre∣tend
to her good Fortune; and shall be very
well contented if I escape the Persecutions which
Persons of my Sex, who are not frightfully ugly,
are always exposed to, without hoping to inspire
such a Passion as that of <HI>Oroondates.</HI></P>
<P>I should be glad to be better acquainted with
the Actions of this happy Lover, Madam, said
<HI>Glanville;</HI> that, forming myself upon his Ex∣ample,
I may hope to please a Lady as worthy
of my Regard as <HI>Statira</HI> was of his.</P>
<P>For Heaven's sake, Cousin, resumed <HI>Arabella,</HI>
laughing, how have you spent your Time;
and to what Studies have you devoted all your
Hours, that you could find none to spare for
the Perusal of Books from which all useful
Knowledge may be drawn; which give us the
most shining Examples of Generosity, Courage,
Virtue, and Love; which regulate our Actions,
form our Manners, and inspire us with a noble
Desire of emulating those great, heroic, and
virtuous Actions, which made those Persons so
glorious in their Age, and so worthy Imitation
in ours? However, as it is never too late to
improve, suffer me to recommend to you the
reading of these Books, which will soon make
you discover the Improprieties you have been
guilty of; and will, probably, induce you to
avoid them for the future.</P>
<P>I shall certainly read them, if you desire it,
said <HI>Glanville;</HI> and I have so great an Inclina∣tion
<PB N="70" REF="86"/>
to be agreeable to you, that I shall em∣brace
every Opportunity of becoming so; and
will therefore take my Instructions from these
Books, if you think proper, or from yourself▪
which, indeed, will be the quickest Method of
teaching me.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> having ordered one of her Women
to bring <HI>Cleopatra, Cassandra, Clelia,</HI> and the
Grand <HI>Cyrus,</HI> from her Library, <HI>Glanville</HI> no
sooner saw the Girl return, sinking under the
Weight of those voluminous Romances, but he
began to tremble at the Apprehension of his
Cousin laying her Commands upon him to read
them; and repented of his Complaisance, which
exposed him to the cruel Necessity of performing
what to him appeared an <HI>Herculean</HI> Labour, or
else incurring her Anger by his Refusal.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> making her Women place the Books
upon a Table before her, opened them, one
after another, with Eyes sparkling with Delight;
while <HI>Glanville</HI> sat rapt in Admiration at the
Sight of so many huge Folio's, written, as he
conceived, upon the most trifling Subjects
imaginable.</P>
<P>I have chosen out these few, said <HI>Arabella</HI>
(not observing his Consternation) from a great
many others, which compose the most valuable
Part of my Library; and, by that time you
have gone thro' these, I imagine you will be
considerably improved.</P>
<P>Certainly, Madam, replied <HI>Glanville,</HI> turn∣ing
over the Leaves in great Confusion, one
may, as you say, be greatly improved; for these
Books contain a great deal: And, looking over
a Page of <HI>Cassandra,</HI> without any Design, read
<PB N="71" REF="87"/>
these Words, which were Part of <HI>Oroondates</HI>'s
Soliloquy when he received a cruel Sentence
from <HI>Statira:</HI></P>
<Q><P>Ah cruel! says this miserable Lover, and
what have I done to merit it? Examine the
Nature of my Offence, and you will see I am
not so guilty, but that my Death may free me
from Part of that Severity: Shall your Hatred
last longer than my Life? And can you detest
a Soul that forsakes its Body only to obey
you? No, no, you are not so hard-hearted;
that Satisfaction will, doubtless, content you:
And, when I shall cease to be, doubtless I
shall cease to be odious to you.</P></Q>
<P>Upon my Soul, said <HI>Glanville,</HI> stifling a
Laugh with great Difficulty, I cannot help
blaming the Lady this sorrowful Lover com∣plains
of, for her great Cruelty; for here he
gives one Reason to suspect, that she will not
even be contented with his dying in Obedience
to her Commands, but will hate him after
Death; an Impiety quite inexcusable in a
Christian!</P>
<P>You condemn this illustrious Princess with
very little Reason, interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> smiling
at his Mistake; for, besides that she was not a
Christian, and ignorant of those Divine Maxims
of Charity and Forgiveness, which Christians,
by their Profession, are obliged to practise, she
was very far from desiring the Death of <HI>Oroon∣dates;</HI>
for, if you will take the Pains to read
the succeeding Passages, you will find that she
expresses herself in the most obliging Manner in
the World; for when <HI>Oroondates</HI> tells her he
would live, if she would consent he should, the
<PB N="72" REF="88"/>
Princess most sweetly replies,<Q> I not only con∣sent,
but also intreat it; and, if I have any
Power, command it.</Q> However, lest you
should fall into the other Extreme, and blame
this great Princess for her Easiness (as you be∣fore
condemned her for her Cruelty), 'tis neces∣sary
you should know how she was induced to
this favourable Behaviour to her Lover: There∣fore
pray read the whole Transaction. Stay!
here it begins, continued she; turning over a
good many Pages, and marking where he should
begin to read.</P>
<P><HI>Glanville,</HI> having no great Stomach to the
Task, endeavoured to evade it, by intreating
his Cousin to relate the Passages she desired he
should be acquainted with: But she declining it,
he was obliged to obey; and began to read
where she directed him: And, to leave him at
Liberty to read with the greater Attention, she
left him, and went to a Window at another
End of the Chamber.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who was not willing to dis∣please
her, examined the Task she had set him,
resolving, if it was not a very hard one, to
comply; but, counting the Pages, he was quite
terrified at the Number, and could not prevail
upon himself to read them: Therefore, glancing
them over, he pretended to be deeply engaged
in reading, when, in Reality, he was contem∣plating
the surprising Effect these Books had
produced in the Mind of his Cousin; who,
had she been untainted with the ridiculous
Whims they created in her Imagination, was,
in his Opinion, one of the most accomplished
Ladies in the World.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="89"/>
When he had sat long enough to make her
believe he had read what she had desired, he
rose up, and, joining her at the Window, began
to talk of the Pleasantness of the Evening, in∣stead
of the Rigour of <HI>Statira.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> coloured with Vexation at his ex∣treme
Indifference in a Matter which was of
such prodigious Consequence, in her Opinion;
but disdaining to put him in mind of his Rude∣ness,
in quitting a Subject they had not
thoroughly discussed, and which she had taken
so much Pains to make him comprehend, she
continued silent; and would not condescend to
afford him an Answer to any thing he said.</P>
<P><HI>Glanville,</HI> by her Silence and Frowns, was
made sensible of his Fault; and, to repair it,
began to talk of the inexorable <HI>Statira,</HI> though,
indeed, he did not well know what to say.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> clearing up a little, did not disdain
to answer him upon her favourite Topic: I
knew, said she, you would be ready to blame
this Princess equally for her Rigour and her
Kindness; but it must be remembred that,
what she did in Favour of <HI>Oroondates,</HI> was
wholly owing to the Generosity of <HI>Artaxerxes.</HI></P>
<P>Here she stopped, expecting <HI>Glanville</HI> to give
his Opinion; who, strangely puzzled, replied
at random, To be sure, Madam, he was a very
generous Rival.</P>
<P>Rival! cried <HI>Arabella; Artaxerxes</HI> the Rival
of <HI>Oroondates!</HI> Why certainly you have lost your
Wits: He was <HI>Statira</HI>'s Brother; and it was to
his Mediation that <HI>Oroondates,</HI> or <HI>Orontes,</HI> owed
his Happiness.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="90"/>
Certainly, Madam, replied <HI>Glanville,</HI> it was
very generous in <HI>Artaxerxes,</HI> as he was Brother
to <HI>Statira,</HI> to interpose in the Behalf of an un∣fortunate
Lover; and both <HI>Oroondates,</HI> and
<HI>Orontes,</HI> were extremely obliged to him.</P>
<P><HI>Orontes,</HI> replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> was more obliged
to him than <HI>Oroondates;</HI> since the Quality of
<HI>Orontes</HI> was infinitely below that of <HI>Oroondates.</HI></P>
<P>But, Madam, interrupted <HI>Glanville</HI> (extreme∣ly
pleased at his having so well got over the Dif∣ficulty
he had been in), which of these two
Lovers did <HI>Statira</HI> make happy?</P>
<P>This unlucky Question immediately informed
<HI>Arabella,</HI> that she had been all this time the
Dupe of her Cousin; who, if he had read a
single Page, would have known that <HI>Orontes</HI>
and <HI>Oroondates</HI> was the same Person; the Name
of <HI>Orontes</HI> being assumed by <HI>Oroondates,</HI> to con∣ceal
his real Name and Quality.</P>
<P>The Shame and Rage she conceived at so
glaring a Proof of his Disrespect, and the Ridi∣cule
to which she had exposed herself, were so
great, that she could not find Words severe
enough to express her Resentment; but, pro∣testing
that no Consideration whatever should
oblige her to converse with him again, she or∣dered
him instantly to quit her Chamber;
and assured him, if he ever attempted to ap∣proach
her again, she would submit to the most
terrible Effects of her Father's Resentment, ra∣ther
than be obliged to see a Person who had,
by his unworthy Behaviour, made himself her
Scorn and Aversion.</P>
<P><HI>Glanville,</HI> who saw himself going to be dis∣carded
a second time, attempted, with great
<PB N="75" REF="91"/>
Submission, to move her to recal her cruel
Sentence; but <HI>Arabella,</HI> bursting into Tears,
complained so pathetically of the Cruelty of her
Destiny, in exposing her to the hated Impor∣tunities
of a Man she despised, and whose Pre∣sence
was so insupportable, that <HI>Glanville,</HI> think∣ing
it best to let her Rage evaporate before he
attempted to pacify her, quitted her Chamber;
cursing <HI>Statira</HI> and <HI>Orontes</HI> a thousand times,
and loading the Authors of those Books with all
the Imprecations his Rage could suggest.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Adventure of the Books continued.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN this Temper he went to the Gardens to
pass over the Chagrin this unfortunate Ac∣cident
had given him; when, meeting the Mar∣quis,
who insisted upon knowing the Cause of
that ill Humour, so visible in his Countenance,
<HI>Glanville</HI> related all that had passed; but, in
Spite of his Anger, it was impossible for him
to repeat the Circumstances of his Disgrace
without laughing, as well as the Marquis; who
thought the Story so extremely diverting, that
he would needs hear it over again.</P>
<P>However, <HI>Charles,</HI> said he, though I shall do
what I can to gain your Pardon from <HI>Bella,</HI> yet
I shall not scruple to own you acted extremely
wrong, in not reading what she desired you;
for, besides losing an Opportunity of obliging
her, you drew yourself into a terrible Dilemma;
<PB N="76" REF="92"/>
for how was it possible for you to evade a Dis∣covery
of the Cheat you put upon her, when
she began to talk with you upon those Passages
she had desired you to read?</P>
<P>I acknowledge my Error, my Lord, answered
<HI>Glanville;</HI> but if you restore me to my Cousin's
Favour again, I promise you to repair it by a
different Behaviour for the future.</P>
<P>I'll see what I can do for you, said the Mar∣quis;
leaving him, to go to <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Apart∣ment,
who had retired to her Closet, extremely
afflicted at this new Insult she had received
from her Cousin: Her Grief was the more
poignant, as she was beginning to imagine, by
the Alteration in his Behaviour, that he would
prove such a Lover as she wished; for Mr.
<HI>Glanville</HI>'s Person and Qualifications had at∣tracted
her particular Notice: And, to speak
in the Language of Romance, she did not hate
him; but, on the contrary, was very much
disposed to wish him well: Therefore, it was no
Wonder she extremely resented the Affront she
had received from him.</P>
<P>The Marquis, not finding her in her Chamber,
proceeded to her Closet, where her Women
informed him she was retired; and, knocking
gently at the Door, was admitted by <HI>Arabella,</HI>
whom he immediately discerned to have been
weeping very much; for her fine Eyes were red
and swelled, and the Traces of her Tears might
still be observed on her fair Face; which, at the
Sight of the Marquis, was overspread with a
Blush, as if she was conscious of her Weak∣ness
in lamenting the Crime her Cousin had been
guilty of.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="93"/>
The Marquis drew a favourable Omen for his
Nephew from her Tears and Confusion; but,
not willing to increase it, by acknowleging he
had observed it, he told her he was come, at
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>'s Request, to make up the Quar∣rel
between them.</P>
<P>Ah! my Lord, interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> speak
no more to me of that unworthy Man, who
has so grosly abused my Favour, and the Pri∣vilege
I allowed him: His Baseness and Ingrati∣tude
are but too manifest; and there is nothing
I so much regret as my Weakness in restoring
him to Part of my good Opinion, after he had
once forfeited it, by an Insolence not to be pa∣ralleled.</P>
<P>Indeed, <HI>Bella,</HI> said the Marquis, smiling, you
resent too deeply these slight Matters: I can't
think my Nephew so guilty as you would have
me believe he is; and you ought neither to be
angry or surprised, that he preferred your Con∣versation
before reading in a foolish old-fashioned
Book that you put in his Hands.</P>
<P>If your Lordship had ever read these Books,
replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> reddening with Vexation, 'tis
probable you would have another Opinion of
them; but, however that may be, my Cousin is
not to be excused for the Contempt he shewed
to my Commands; and for daring, by the Cheat
he put on me, to expose me to the Shame of
seeing myself so ridiculously imposed upon.</P>
<P>However, you must forgive him, said the
Marquis; and I insist upon it, before I quit your
Apartment, that you receive him into Favour.</P>
<P>Pardon me, my Lord, replied <HI>Arabella;</HI> this
is what I neither can, nor ought to do; and I
<PB N="78" REF="94"/>
hope you will not wrong me so much as to
continue to desire it.</P>
<P>Nay, <HI>Bella,</HI> said he, this is carrying Things
too far, and making trifling Disputes of too
great Consequence: I am surprised at your
Treatment of a Man whom, after all, if ever
you intend to obey me, you must consent to
marry.</P>
<P>There is no Question, my Lord, replied she,
but it would be my Glory to obey you in what∣ever
is possible; but this you command me now
to do, not being so, I conceive you will rather
impute my Refusal to Necessity, than Choice.</P>
<P>How! returned the Marquis, will you en∣deavour
to persuade me, that it is not possible
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> should be your Husband?</P>
<P>'Tis impossible he should be so with my Con∣sent,
resumed <HI>Arabella;</HI> and I cannot give it
without wounding my own Quiet in a most
sensible manner.</P>
<P>Come, come, <HI>Bella,</HI> said the Marquis (fret∣ting
at her extreme Obstinacy), this is too much:
I am to blame to indulge your Foibles in this
Manner: Your Cousin is worthy of your Af∣fection,
and you cannot refuse it to him with∣out
incurring my Displeasure.</P>
<P>Since my Affection is not in my own Power
to bestow, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> weeping, I know not
how to remove your Displeasure; but, question∣less,
I know how to die, to avoid the Effects
of what would be to me the most terrible Mis∣fortune
in the World.</P>
<P>Foolish Girl! interrupted the Marquis, how
strangely do you talk? Are the Thoughts of
<PB N="79" REF="95"/>
Death become so familiar to you, that you speak
of dying with so little Concern?</P>
<P>Since, my Lord, resumed she, in an exalted
Tone, I do not yield, either in Virtue or Courage,
to many others of my Sex, who, when perse∣cuted
like me, have fled to Death for Relief, I
know not why I should be thought less capable
of it than they; and if <HI>Artimisa, Candace,</HI> and
the beautiful Daughter of <HI>Cleopatra,</HI> could brave
the Terrors of Death for the sake of the Men
they loved, there is no Question but I also could
imitate their Courage, to avoid the Man I have
so much Reason to hate.</P>
<P>The Girl is certainly distracted, interrupted
the Marquis, excessively enraged at the strange
Speech she had uttered: These foolish Books my
Nephew talks of have turned her Brain! Where
are they? pursued he, going into her Chamber:
I'll burn all I can lay my Hands upon.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> trembling for the Fate of her Books,
followed her Father into the Room; who seeing
the Books which had caused this woful Ad∣venture
lying upon the Table, he ordered one
of her Women to carry them into his Apart∣ment,
vowing he would commit them all to the
Flames.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> not daring, in the Fury he was in,
to interpose, he went out of the Room, leaving
her to bewail the Fate of so many illustrious
Heroes and Heroines, who, by an Effect of a
more cruel Tyranny than any they had ever ex∣perienced
before, were going to be cast into the
merciless Flames; which would, doubtless, pay
very little Regard to the divine Beauties of the
admirable <HI>Clelia,</HI> or the heroic Valour of the
<PB N="80" REF="96"/>
brave <HI>Orontes;</HI> and the rest of those great
Princes and Princesses, whose Actions <HI>Arabella</HI>
proposed for the Model of hers.</P>
<P>Fortune, however, which never wholly for∣sook
these illustrious Personages, rescued them
from so unworthy a Fate, and brought Mr.
<HI>Glanville</HI> into the Marquis's Chamber just as he
was giving Orders to have them destroyed.</P>

<P><PB N="82" REF="98"/>
Though I have all the Reason in the World
to be enraged with that Incendiary <HI>Statira,</HI> said
<HI>Glanville</HI> laughing, for the Mischief she has
done me; yet I cannot consent to put such an
Affront upon my Cousin, as to burn her fa∣vourite
Books: And now I think of it, my Lord,
pursued he, I'll endeavour to make a Merit with
Lady <HI>Bella</HI> by saving them: Therefore spare
them, at my Request, and let me carry them
to her. I shall be quite unhappy till we are
Friends again.</P>
<P>You may do as you will, said the Marquis;
but I think it encouraging her in her Follies to
give them to her again.</P>
<P><HI>Glanville,</HI> without replying, eagerly took up
the Books, for fear the Marquis should change
his Mind; and, highly delighted with the Op∣portunity
he had got of making his Peace with
Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> ran to her Apartment, loaded with
these kind Intercessors; and, making his Way by
<HI>Lucy,</HI> who would have opposed him, penetrated
even into the Closet of the melancholy Fair-one,
who was making bitter Reflections on the Cru∣elty
of her Destiny, and bewailing her Loss
with a Deluge of Tears.</P>
<P>As ridiculous as the Occasion of these Tears
was, yet <HI>Glanville</HI> could not behold them with∣out
being affected: Assuming, therefore, a Coun∣tenance
as sad as he was able, he laid the Books
before her; and told her, he hoped she would
excuse his coming into her Presence without
her Permission, since it was only to restore her
those Books, whose Loss she seemed so greatly
to lament; and added, that it was with much
Difficulty he prevailed upon the Marquis not to
<PB N="83" REF="99"/>
burn them immediately; and his Fears, that he
might really do as he threatened, made him
snatch them up, and bring them, with so little
Ceremony, into her Closet.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> whose Countenance brightened into
a Smile of pleasing Surprize at the Sight of her
recovered Treasure, turned her bright Eyes upon
<HI>Glanville</HI> with a Look of Complacency that went
to his Heart.</P>
<P>I well perceive, said she, that, in exaggera∣ting
the Merit of this little Service you have done
me, you expect I should suffer it to cancel your
past Offences: I am not ungrateful enough to
be insensible of any Kindness that is shewn me;
and, tho' I might be excused for suspecting it
was rather Policy than Friendship, that induced
you to seek my Satisfaction, by saving these in∣nocent
Victims of my Father's Displeasure, ne∣vertheless
I pardon you upon the Supposition,
that you will, for the future, avoid all Occa∣sion
of offending me.</P>
<P>At these Words, she made a Sign to him to
be gone, fearing the Extravagance of his Joy
would make him throw himself at her Feet to
thank her for the infinite Favour she had con∣ferred
upon him; but, finding he seemed dis∣posed
to stay longer, she called one of her Wo∣men
into the Closet; and, by some very signi∣ficant
Frowns, gave <HI>Glanville</HI> to understand his
Stay was displeasing; so that he left her, with a
very low Bow, highly pleased at her having
repealed his Banishment; and, assured the Mar∣quis,
that nothing could have happened more
fortunate for him, than his intended Disposal of
<PB N="84" REF="100"/>
his Daughter's Books, since it had proved the
Means of restoring him to her Favour.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Which contains a very natural Incident.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>FROM this Time Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> tho' he
was far from coming up to Lady <HI>Bella</HI>'s
Idea of a Lover, yet, by the Pains he apparently
seemed to be at in obliging her, made every
Day some Progress in her Esteem. The Mar∣quis
was extremely pleased at the Harmony
which subsisted between them; tho' he could
have wished to have seen their Marriage advance
a little faster; but <HI>Glanville,</HI> who was better ac∣quainted
with <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Foible than the Mar∣quis,
assured him, he would ruin all his Hopes,
if he pressed her to marry; and intreated him
to leave it intirely to him, to dispose her to con∣sent
to both their Wishes.</P>
<P>The Marquis was satisfied with his Reasons,
and, resolving not to importune his Daughter,
upon that Subject, any more, they lived for
some Months in a perfect Tranquillity; to which
an Illness the Marquis was seized with, and
which was, from the first, thought to be dan∣gerous
gave a sad Interruption.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI>'s extreme Tenderness upon this Oc∣casion,
her anxious Solicitude, her pious Cares,
and never-ceasing Attendance at the Bedside of
her sick Father, were so many new Charms,
<PB N="85" REF="101"/>
that engaged the Affection of <HI>Glanville</HI> more
strongly. As the Marquis's Indisposition in∣creased,
so did her Care and Affiduity: She would
not allow any one to give him any thing but her∣self;
bore all the pettish Humours of a sick Man
with a surprising Sweetness and Patience; watched
whole Nights, successively, by his Bedside; and
when, at his Importunity, she consented to take
any Rest, it was only upon a Couch in his
Chamber, from whence no Intreaties could
make her remove. Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> partook with
her in these Fatigues; and, by his Care of her
Father, and Tenderness for her, confirmed her
in the Esteem she had entertained of him.</P>
<P>The Marquis, who had struggled with the Vi∣olence
of his Distemper for a Fortnight, died
on the Fifteenth Day in the Arms of <HI>Arabella,</HI>
who received his last Looks; his Eyes never re∣moving
themselves from her Face, till they were
closed by Death. Her Spirits, which the De∣sire
she had of being useful to him, had alone
supported, now failed her at once; and she fell
upon the Bed, without Sense or Motion, as soon
as she saw him expire.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who was kneeling on the other
Side, and had been holding one of his Uncle's
Hands, started up in the most terrible Conster∣nation,
and, seeing the Condition she was in,
flew to her Relief: Her Women, while he sup∣ported
her, used all the Endeavours they could
think of to recover her; but she continued so
long in her Swoon, that they apprehended she
was dead; and <HI>Glanville</HI> was resigning himself
up to the most bitter Sorrow, when she opened
her Eyes; but it was only to close them again.
<PB N="86" REF="102"/>
Her Faintings continued the whole Day; and
the Physicians declaring she was in great Danger,
from her extreme Weakness, she was carried
to Bed in a Condition that seemed to promise
very little Hopes of her Life.</P>
<P>The Care of the Marquis's Funeral devolving
upon Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> he sent a Messenger express
for his Father, who was appointed Guardian
to Lady <HI>Bella;</HI> the Marquis having first asked
her if she was willing it should be so. This
Gentleman arrived Time enough to be Witness
of that sad Ceremony, which was performed
with a Magnificence suitable to the Birth and
Fortune of the Marquis.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Bella</HI> kept her Bed several Days, and
her Life was thought to be in Danger; but her
Youth, and the Strength of her Constitution,
overcame her Disease; and, when she was so
well recovered as to be able to admit of a Visit
from her Uncle, Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> sent for Permis∣sion
to introduce him: The afflicted <HI>Arabella</HI>
granted his Request; but, being then more in∣disposed
than usual, she intreated they would de∣fer
their Visit for an Hour or two, which they
complied with; and, returning at the appointed
Time, were conducted into her Dressing-Room
by <HI>Lucy,</HI> who informed them her Lady was just
fallen into a Slumber.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who had not seen her for
some Days, expected her waking with great
Impatience; and pleased himself with describing
her, with a Lover's Fondness, to his Father,
when the Sound of her Voice in the next Room
interrupted him.</P>

<PB N="87" REF="103"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Which treats of a consolatory Visit, and
other grave Matters.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>ARABELLA,</HI> being then awaked from her
Slumber, was indulging her Grief by Com∣plaints,
which her Women were so used to hear,
that they never offered to disturb her. Merci∣less
Fate! said she, in the most moving Tone
imaginable, Cruel Destiny! that, not contented
with having deprived my Infancy of the soft
Cares, and tender Indulgences, of a Mother's
Fondness, has robbed me of the only Parent I
had left, and exposed me, at these early Years,
to the Grief of losing him, who was not only
my Father, but my Friend, and Protector of
my Youth!</P>
<P>Then, pausing a Moment, she renewed her
Complaints with a deep Sigh: Dear Relics of
the best of Fathers! pursued she, Why was it
not permitted me to bathe you with my Tears?
Why were those sacred Remains of him, from
whom I drew my Life, snatched from my Eyes,
ere they had poured their Tribute of Sorrow
over them? Ah! pitiless Women! said she to
her Attendants, you prevented me from per∣forming
the last pious Rites to my dear Father!
You, by your cruel Care, hindered me from
easing my sad Heart, by paying him the last
Duties he could receive from me! Pardon, O
dear and sacred Shade of my loved Father!
pardon this unwilling Neglect of thy afflicted
<PB N="88" REF="104"/>
Child, who, to the last Moment of her wretched
Life, will bewail thy Loss!</P>
<P>Here she ceased speaking; and Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI>
whom this Soliloquy had much less confounded
than his Father, was preparing to go in, and
comfort her; when the old Gentleman stopping
him with a Look of great Concern: My Niece
is certainly much worse than we apprehend,
said he: She is in a Delirium: Our Presence may,
perhaps, discompose her too much.</P>
<P>No, Sir, replied <HI>Glanville,</HI> extremely con∣fused
at this Suspicion; my Cousin is not so bad
as you suppose: It is common enough for Peo∣ple
in any great Affliction to ease themselves by
Complaints.</P>
<P>But these, replied the Knight, are the strangest
Complaints I ever heard, and savour so much of
Phrensy, that I am persuaded her Head is not
quite right.</P>
<P><HI>Glanville</HI> was going to reply, when <HI>Lucy,</HI> en∣tering,
told them her Lady had ordered their
Admission: Upon which they followed her into
<HI>Arabella</HI>'s Chamber, who was lying negli∣gently
upon her Bed.</P>
<P>Her deep Mourning, and the black Gawse,
which covered Part of her fair Face, was so ad∣vantageous
to her Shape and Complexion, that
Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> who had not seen her since she grew
up, was struck with an extreme Surprize at her
Beauty, while his Son was gazing on her so
passionately, that he never thought of introducing
his Father to her, who contemplated her with
as much Admiration as his Son, though with less
Passion.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="105"/>
<HI>Arabella,</HI> rising from her Bed, saluted her
Uncle with a Grace that wholly charmed him;
and, turning to receive Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> she burst
into Tears at the Remembrance of his having
assisted her in her last Attendance upon her Fa∣ther.
Alas! Sir, said she, when we saw each
other last, we were both engaged, in a very
melancholy Office: Had it pleased Heaven to
have spared my Father, he would, doubtless,
have been extremely sensible of your generous
Cares; nor shall you have any Reason to accuse
me of Ingratitude, since I shall always acknow∣lege
your Kindness as I ought.</P>
<P>If you think you owe me any Obligation, re∣turned
<HI>Glanville,</HI> pay me, dearest Cousin, by
moderating your Sorrow: Indeed your suffer
yourself to sink too much under an Affliction
which is impossible to be remedied.</P>
<P>Alas! answered <HI>Arabella,</HI> my Grief is very
slight, compared to that of many others upon
the Death of their Relations: The Great <HI>Sysi∣gambis,</HI>
who, questionless, wanted neither For∣titude
nor Courage, upon the News of her
Grand-daughter's Death, wrapt herself up in her
Veil; and, resolving never more to behold the
Light, waited for Death in that Posture.</P>
<P><HI>Menecrates,</HI> upon the Loss of his Wife, built
a magnificent Tomb for her; and, shutting him∣self
up in it, resolved to pass away the Remain∣der
of his Life with her Ashes. These, in∣deed,
were glorious Effects of Piety and Affec∣tion,
and unfeigned Signs of an excessive Sor∣row:
What are the few Tears I shed to such
illustrious Instances of Grief and Affection, as
these?</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="106"/>
<HI>Glanville,</HI> finding his Cousin upon this Strain,
blushed extremely, and would have changed the
Subject; but the old Gentleman, who had never
heard of these two Persons she mentioned, who
expressed their Sorrow for their Losses in so
strange a Manner, was surprised at it; and was
resolved to know more about them.</P>
<P>Pray, Niece, said he, were you acquainted
with these People, who could not submit to the
Dispensation of Providence, but, as one may
say, flew in the Face of Heaven by their Impa∣tience?</P>
<P>I am very well acquainted with their History,
resumed <HI>Arabella;</HI> and I can assure you, they
were both very admirable Persons.</P>
<P>Oh! Oh! their History! interrupted the
Knight! What, I warrant you, they are to be
found in the <HI>Fairy Tales,</HI> and those sort of Books!
Well, I never could like such Romances, not
I; for they only spoil Youth, and put strange
Notions into their Heads.</P>
<P>I am sorry, resumed <HI>Arabella,</HI> blushing with
Anger, that we are like to differ in Opinion
upon so important a Point.</P>
<P>Truly, Niece, said Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> if we never
differ in any thing else, I shall be very easy about
this slight Matter; tho' I think a young Lady
of your fine Sense (for my Son praises you to
the Skies for your <HI>Wit</HI>) should not be so fond
of such ridiculous Nonsense as these Story-Books
are filled with.</P>
<P>Upon my Word, resumed <HI>Arabella,</HI> all the
Respect I owe you cannot hinder me from tell∣ing
you, that I take it extremely ill you should,
in my Presence, rail at the finest Productions in
<PB N="91" REF="107"/>
the World: I think, we are infinitely obliged
to these Authors, who have, in so sublime a Style,
delivered down to Posterity the heroic Actions
of the bravest Men, and most virtuous of Wo∣men:
But for the inimitable Pen of the famous
<HI>Scudery,</HI> we had been ignorant of the Lives of
many great and illustrious Persons: The war∣like
Actions of <HI>Oroondates, Aronces, Juba,</HI> and
the renowned <HI>Artaban,</HI> had, haply, never been
talked of in our Age; and those fair and chaste
Ladies, who were the Objects of their pure and
constant Passions, had still been buried in Obscu∣rity;
and neither their divine Beauties, or sin∣gular
Virtue, been the Subject of our Admira∣tion
and Praise. But for the famous <HI>Scudery,</HI>
we had not known the true Cause of that Action
of <HI>Clelia</HI>'s, for which the Senate decreed her a
Statue; namely, Her casting herself, with an
unparalleled Courage, into the <HI>Tyber,</HI> a deep
and rapid River, as you must certainly know,
and swimming to the other Side. It was not, as
the <HI>Roman</HI> Historians falsly report, a Stratagem to
recover herself, and the other Hostages, from the
Power of <HI>Porsena;</HI> it was to preserve her Ho∣nour
from Violation by the impious <HI>Sextus,</HI>
who was in the Camp. But for <HI>Scudery,</HI> we had
still thought the inimitable Poetess <HI>Sappho</HI> to be
a loose Wanton, whose Verses breathed nothing
but unchaste and irregular Fires: On the con∣trary,
she was so remarkably chaste, that she
would never even consent to marry; but, loving
<HI>Phaon,</HI> only with a Platonic Passion, obliged
him to restrain his Desires within the Compass
of a Brother's Affection. Numberless are the
Mistakes he has cleared up of this Kind; and
<PB N="92" REF="108"/>
I question, if any other Historian, but himself,
knew that <HI>Cleopatra</HI> was really married to <HI>Julius
Caesar;</HI> or that <HI>Caesario,</HI> her Son by this Mar∣riage,
was not murdered, as was supposed, by
the Order of <HI>Augustus,</HI> but married the fair
Queen of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> in whose Dominions he took
Refuge. The prodigious Acts of Valour, which
he has recounted of those accomplished Princes,
have never been equalled by the Heroes of either
the <HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>Roman</HI> Historians: How poor and
insignificant are the Actions of their Warriors
to <HI>Scudery</HI>'s, where one of those admirable He∣roes
would put whole Armies into Terror, and
with his single Arm oppose a Legion!</P>
<P>Indeed, Niece, said Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> no longer
able to forbear interrupting her, these are all
very improbable Tales. I remember, when I
was a Boy, I was very fond of reading the Hi∣story
of <HI>Jack the Giant killer,</HI> and <HI>Tom Thumb;</HI>
and these Stories so filled my Head, that I really
thought one of those little Heroes killed Men an
hundred Feet high; and that the other, after a
great many surprising Exploits, was swallowed
up by a Cow.</P>
<P>You was very young, Sir, you say, interrupted
<HI>Arabella</HI> tartly, when those Stories gained your
Belief: However, your Judgment was certainly
younger, if you ever believed them at all; for
as credulous as you are pleased to think me, I
should never, at any Age, have been persuaded
such Things could have happened.</P>
<P>My Father, Madam, said <HI>Glanville,</HI> who
was strangely confused all this Time, bore Arms
in his Youth; and Soldiers, you know, never
trouble themselves much with reading.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="109"/>
Has my Uncle been a Soldier, said <HI>Arabella,</HI>
and does he hold in Contempt the Actions of
the bravest Soldiers in the World?</P>
<P>The Soldiers you speak of, Niece, said Sir
<HI>Charles,</HI> were indeed the bravest Soldiers in
the World; for I don't believe, they ever had
their Equals.</P>
<P>And yet, Sir, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> there are a great
Number of such Soldiers to be found in <HI>Scudery.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed, my dear Niece, interrupted Sir <HI>Charles,</HI>
they are to be found no-where else, except in
your Imagination, which, I am sorry to see, is
filled with such <HI>Whimsies.</HI></P>
<P>If you mean this to affront me, Sir, resumed
<HI>Arabella,</HI> hardly able to forbear Tears, I know
how far, as my Uncle, I ought to bear with
you: But, methinks, it is highly unkind to ag∣gravate
my Sorrows by such cruel Jests; and,
since I am not in an Humour to suffer them,
don't take it ill, if I intreat you to leave me to
myself.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who knew nothing pleased his
Cousin so much as paying an exact Obedience
to her Commands, rose up immediately; and,
bowing respectfully to her, asked his Father, If
he should attend him into the Gardens?</P>
<P>The Baronet, who thought <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Beha∣viour
bordered a good deal upon Rudeness, took
his Leave with some Signs of Displeasure upon
his Countenance; and, notwithstanding all his
Son could say in Excuse for her, he was ex∣tremely
offended.</P>
<P>What, said he, to Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> does she
so little understand the Respect that is due to me
as her Uncle, that she, so peremptorily, desired
<PB N="94" REF="110"/>
me to leave her Room? My Brother was to
blame to take so little Care of her Education;
she is quite a Rustic!</P>
<P>Ah! don't wrong your Judgment so much,
Sir, said <HI>Glanville;</HI> my Cousin has as little of
the Rustic as if she had passed all her Life in a
Court: Her fine Sense, and the native Elegance
of her Manners give an inimitable Grace to her
Behaviour; and as much exceed the studied Po∣liteness
of other Ladies I have conversed with,
as the Beauties of her Person do all I have ever
seen.</P>
<P>She is very handsome, I confess, returned Sir
<HI>Charles;</HI> but I cannot think so well of her <HI>Wit</HI>
as you do; for methinks she talks very oddly,
and has the strangest Conceits! Who, but her∣self,
would think it probable, that one Man
could put a whole Army to Flight; or commend
a foolish Fellow for living in a Tomb, because
his Wife was buried in it? Fie, fie! these are
silly and extravagant Notions, and will make
her appear very ridiculous.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> was so sensible of the Justness
of this Remark, that he could not help sighing;
which his Father observing, told him, That,
since she was to be his Wife, it was his Business
to produce a Reformation in her; for, added
he, notwithstanding the immense Fortune she
will bring you, I should be sorry to have a
Daughter-in-law, for whom I should blush as
often as she opens her Mouth.</P>
<P>I assure you, Sir, said Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> I have
but very little Hopes, that I shall be so happy as
to have my Cousin for a Wife; for, tho' it was
my Uncle's Command I should make my Ad∣dresses
<PB N="95" REF="111"/>
to her, she received me so ill, as a Lover,
that I have never dared to talk to her upon that
Subject since.</P>
<P>And pray, resumed Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> upon what
Terms are you at present?</P>
<P>While I seem to pretend nothing to her, as a
Lover, replied Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> she is very obli∣ging,
and we live in great Harmony together;
but I am persuaded, if I exceed the Bounds of
Friendship in my Professions, she will treat me
extremely ill.</P>
<P>But, interrupted Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> when she shall
know, that her Father has bequeathed you one
Third of his Estate, provided she don't marry
you, 'tis probable her Mind may change; and
you may depend upon it, since your Heart is so
much set upon her, that, as I am her Guardian,
I shall press her to perform the Marquis's Will.</P>
<P>Ah! Sir, resumed Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> never at∣tempt
to lay any Constraint upon my Cousin in
an Affair of this Nature: Permit me to tell you,
it would be an Abuse of the Marquis's generous
Confidence, and what I would never submit
to.</P>
<P>Nay, nay, said the old Gentleman, you have
no Reason to fear any Compulsion from me:
Tho' her Father has left me her Guardian, till
she is of Age, yet it is with such Restriction,
that my Niece is quite her own Mistress in that
Respect; for tho' she is directed to consult me
in her Choice of an Husband, yet my Consent
is not absolutely necessary. The Marquis has
certainly had a great Opinion of his Daughter's
Prudence; and I hope, she will prove herself
worthy of it by her Conduct.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="112"/>
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> was so taken up with his Re∣flections
upon the State of his Affairs, that he
made but little Reply; and, as soon as he had
disengaged himself, retired to his Chamber, to
be at more Liberty to indulge his Meditations.
As he could not flatter himself, with having
made any Impression upon the Heart of <HI>Arabella,</HI>
he foresaw a thousand Incoveniences from the
Death of the Marquis; for, besides that he lost
a powerful Mediator with his Cousin, he feared
that, when she appeared in the World, her
Beauty and Fortune would attract a Croud of
Admirers, among whom, it was probable, she
would find some one more agreeable to her
Taste than himself. As he loved her with great
Tenderness, this Thought made him extremely
uneasy; and he would sometimes wish the Mar∣quis
had laid a stronger Injunction upon her in
his Will to marry him; and regretted the little
Power his Father had over her: But he was too
generous, to dwell long upon these Thoughts,
and contented himself with doing all that was
honourable to obtain her, without seeking for
any Assistance from unjustifiable Methods.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Which contains some common Occurrences,
but placed in a new Light.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>ARABELLA,</HI> in a few Days, leaving her
Chamber, had so many Opportunities of
charming her Uncle by her Conversation,
<PB N="97" REF="113"/>
which, when it did not turn upon any Incident
in her Romances, was perfectly fine, easy, and
entertaining, that he declared, he should quit
the Castle with great Regret; and endeavoured
to persuade her to accompany him to Town:
But <HI>Arabella,</HI> who was determined to pass the
Year of her Mourning, in the Retirement she
had always lived in, absolutely refused, strong
as her Curiosity was, to see <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> secretly rejoiced at this Resolu∣tion,
tho' he seemed desirous of making her
change it; but she was unalterable; and, there∣fore,
the Baronet did not think proper to press
her any more.</P>
<P>Her Father's Will being read to her, she
seemed extremely pleased with the Articles in fa∣vour
of Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> wishing him Joy of the
Estate that was bequeathed to him, with a most
inchanting Sweetness.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> sighed, and cast his Eyes on
the Ground, as he returned her Compliment,
with a very low Bow; and Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> observ∣ing
his Confusion, told <HI>Arabella,</HI> that he thought
it was a very bad Omen for his Son, to wish
him Joy of an Estate, which he could not come to
the Possession of, but by a very great Misfortune.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> understanding his Meaning, blushed;
and, willing to change the Discourse, proceeded
to consult her Uncle upon the Regulation of her
House. Besides the Legacies her Father had
bequeathed to his Servants, those, who were
more immediately about his Person, she desired,
might have their Salaries continued to them:
She made no other Alteration, than discharging
these Attendants, retaining all the others; and
<PB N="98" REF="114"/>
submitting to her Uncle the Management of her
Estates, receiving the Allowance he thought
proper to assign her, till she was of Age, of
which she wanted three Years.</P>
<P>Every Thing being settled, Sir <HI>Charles</HI> pre∣pared
to return to Town. Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who
desired nothing so much as to stay some time
longer with his Cousin in her Solitude, got his
Father to intreat that Favour for him of <HI>Ara∣bella:</HI>
But she represented to her Uncle the Im∣propriety
of a young Gentleman's staying with
her, in her House, now her Father was dead,
in a manner so genteel and convincing, that
Sir <HI>Charles</HI> could press it no further; and all
that Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> could obtain, was, a Permis∣sion
to visit her some time after, provided he
could prevail upon his Sister, Miss <HI>Charlotte
Glanville,</HI> to accompany him.</P>
<P>The Day of their Departure being come, Sir
<HI>Charles</HI> took his Leave of his charming Niece,
with many Expressions of Esteem and Affection;
and Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> appeared so concerned, that
<HI>Arabella</HI> could not help observing it; and bade
him adieu with great Sweetness.</P>
<P>When they were gone, she found her Time
hung heavy upon her Hands; her Father was
continually in her Thoughts, and made her ex∣tremely
melancholy: She recollected the many
agreeable Conversations she had had with <HI>Glan∣ville;</HI>
and wished it had been consistent with
Decency to have detained him. Her Books
being the only Amusement she had left, she ap∣plied
herself to reading with more Eagerness
than ever; but, notwithstanding the Delight
she took in this Employment, she had so many
Hours of Solitude and Melancholy to indulge
<PB N="99" REF="115"/>
the Remembrance of her Father in, that she
was very far from being happy.</P>
<P>As she wished for nothing more passionately
than an agreeable Companion of her own Sex
and Rank, an Accident threw a Person in her
Way, who, for some Days, afforded her a little
Amusement. Stepping one Day out of her Coach,
to go into Church, she saw a young Lady enter,
accompanied with a middle-aged Woman, who
seemed to be an Attendant. As <HI>Arabella</HI> had
never seen any one, above the Rank of a Gen∣tleman
Farmer's Daughter, in this Church, her
Attention was immediately engaged by the Ap∣pearance
of this Stranger, who was very mag∣nificently
dressed: Tho' she did not seem to be
more than eighteen Years of Age, her Statute
was above the ordinary Size of Women; and,
being rather too plump to be delicate, her Mien
was so majestic, and such an Air of Grandeur
was diffused over her whole Person, joined to
the Charms of a very lovely Face, that <HI>Arabella</HI>
could hardly help thinking she saw the beautiful
<HI>Candace</HI> before her, who, by <HI>Scudery</HI>'s Descrip∣tion,
very much resembled this Fair one.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> having heedfully observed her Looks,
thought she saw a great Appearance of Melan∣choly
in her Eyes, which filled her with a gene∣rous
Concern for the Misfortunes of so admira∣ble
a Person; but, the Service beginning, she
was not at Liberty to indulge her Reflections
upon this Occasion, as she never suffered any
Thoughts, but those of Religion, to intrude
upon her Mind, during these pious Rites.</P>
<P>As she was going out of Church she observed
the young Lady, attended only with the Wo∣man
who came with her, preparing to walk
<PB N="100" REF="116"/>
home, and therefore stept forward, and, salu∣ting
her with a Grace peculiar to herself, in∣treated
her to come into her Coach, and give
her the Pleasure of setting her down at her own
House: So obliging an Offer from a Person of
<HI>Arabella</HI>'s Rank could not fail of being received
with great Respect by the young Lady, who was
not ignorant of all the Forms of Good-breeding;
and, accepting her Invitation, she stepped into
the Coach; <HI>Arabella</HI> obliging her Woman to
come in also, for whom, as she had that Day only
<HI>Lucy</HI> along with her, there was Room enough.</P>
<P>As they were going home, <HI>Arabella,</HI> who
longed to be better acquainted, intreated the
fair Stranger, as she called her, to go to the Ca∣stle,
and spend the Day with her; and she con∣senting,
they passed by the House where she
lodged, and alighted at the Castle, where <HI>Ara∣bella</HI>
welcomed her, with the most obliging Ex∣pressions
of Civility and Respect. The young
Lady, tho' perfectly versed in the Modes of
Town-Breeding, and <HI>nothing-meaning</HI> Ceremo∣ny,
was at a Loss how to make proper Returns
to the Civilities of <HI>Arabella:</HI> The native Elegance
and Simplicity of her Manners were accompa∣nied
with so much real Benevolence of Heart,
such insinuating Tenderness, and Graces so ir∣resistible,
that she was quite oppressed with
them; and, having spent most of her Time be∣tween
her Toilet and Quadrille, was so little
qualified for partaking a Conversation so refined
as <HI>Arabella</HI>'s, that her Discourse appeared quite
tedious to her, since it was neither upon Fa∣shions,
Assemblies, Cards, or Scandal.</P>
<P>Her Silence, and that Absence of Mind, which
she betrayed, made <HI>Arabella</HI> conclude, she was
<PB N="101" REF="117"/>
under some very great Affliction; and, to amuse
her after Dinner, led her into the Gardens, sup∣posing
a Person, whose Uneasiness, as she did
not doubt, proceeded from Love, would be
pleased with the Sight of Groves and Streams,
and be tempted to disclose her Misfortunes,
while they wandered in that agreeable Privacy.
In this, however, she was deceived; for, tho' the
young Lady sighed several times, yet, when she
did speak, it was only of indifferent Things, and
not at all in the manner of an afflicted Heroine.</P>
<P>After observing upon a thousand Trifles, she
told <HI>Arabella</HI> at last, to whom she was desirous
of making known her Alliance to Quality, that
these Gardens were extremely like those of her
Father's-in-Law, the Duke of—at—</P>
<P>At this Intimation, she expected <HI>Arabella</HI>
would be extremely surprised; but that Lady,
whose Thoughts were always familiarized to Ob∣jects
of Grandeur, and would not have been
astonished, if she had understood her Guest was
the Daughter of a King, appeared so little moved,
that the Lady was piqued by her Indifference;
and, after a few Moment's Silence, began to
mention going away.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> who was desirous of retaining her a
few Days, intreated her so obligingly to favour
her with her Company, for some time, in her
Solitude, that the other could not refuse; and,
dispatching her Woman to the House where she
lodged, to inform them of her Stay at the Castle,
would have dispensed with her coming again to
attend her, had not <HI>Arabella</HI> insisted upon the
contrary.</P>
<P>The Reserve, which the Daughter-in-Law
of the Duke of—still continued to maintain,
<PB N="102" REF="118"/>
notwithstanding the repeated Expressions of
Friendship <HI>Arabella</HI> used to her, increased her
Curiosity to know her Adventures, which she
was extremely surprised, she had never offered
to relate; but, attributing her Silence, upon this
Head, to her Modesty, she was resolved, as was
the Custom in those Cases, to oblige her Wo∣man,
who, she presumed, was her Confidante,
to relate, her Lady's History to her; and send∣ing
for this Person one Day, when she was
alone, to attend her in her Closet, she gave
Orders to her Women, if the fair Stranger came
to inquire for her, to say she was then busy, but
would wait on her as soon as possible.</P>
<P>After this Caution, she ordered Mrs. <HI>Morris</HI>
to be admitted; and, obliging her to sit down,
told her, she sent for her in order to hear from
her the History of her Lady's Life, which she
was extremely desirous of knowing.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Morris,</HI> who was a Person of Sense,
and had seen the World, was extremely surprised
at this Request of <HI>Arabella,</HI> which was quite
contrary to the Laws of Good-breeding; and,
as she thought, betrayed a great deal of imperti∣nent
Curiosity: She could not tell how to account
for the free Manner in which she desired her to
give up her Lady's Secrets, which, indeed, were
not of a Nature to be told; and appeared so
much confused, that <HI>Arabella</HI> took Notice of it;
and, supposing it was her Bashfulness which
caused her Embarrassment, she endeavoured to
re-assure her by the most affable Behaviour ima∣ginable.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Morris,</HI> who was not capable of much
Fidelity for her Lady, being but lately taken
<PB N="103" REF="119"/>
into her Service, and not extremely fond of her,
thought she had now a fine Opportunity of re∣commending
herself to <HI>Arabella,</HI> by telling her
all she knew of Miss <HI>Groves,</HI> for that was her
Name; and, therefore, told her, since she was
pleased to command it, she would give her what
Account she was able of her Lady; but in∣treated
her to be secret, because it was of great
Consequence to her, that her Affairs should not
be known.</P>
<P>I always imagined, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> that your
beautiful Mistress had some particular Reason
for not making herself known, and for coming
in this private Manner into this Part of the
Country: You may assure yourself therefore,
that I will protect her as far as I am able, and
offer her all the Assistance in my Power to give
her: Therefore you may acquaint me with her
Adventures, without being apprehensive of a
Discovery that would be prejudicial to her.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Morris,</HI> who had been much better
pleased with the Assurances of a Reward for the
Intelligence she was going to give her, looked
a little foolish at these fine Promises, in which she
had no Share; and <HI>Arabella,</HI> supposing she was
endeavouring to recollect all the Passages of her
Lady's Life, told her, She need not give herself
the Trouble to acquaint her with any thing that
passed during the Infancy of her Lady, but pro∣ceed
to acquaint her with Matters of greater Im∣portance:
And since, said she, you have, no
doubt, been most favoured with her Confidence,
you will do me a Pleasure to describe to me, ex∣actly,
all the Thoughts of her Soul, as she has
communicated them to you, that I may the
better comprehend her History.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The History of Miss Groves, interspersed
with some very curious Observations.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THOUGH, Madam, said Mrs. <HI>Morris,</HI>
I have not been long in Miss <HI>Groves</HI>'s Ser∣vice,
yet I know a great many Things by the
means of her former Woman, who told them
to me, tho' my Lady thinks I am ignorant of
them; and I know that this is her second Trip
into the Country.</P>
<P>Pray, interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> do me the Fa∣vour
to relate Things methodically: Of what
Use is it to me to know that this is your Lady's
second Trip, as you call it, into the Country,
if I know not the Occasion of it? Therefore be∣gin
with informing me, who were the Parents
of this admirable young Person.</P>
<P>Her Father, Madam, said Mrs. <HI>Morris,</HI> was
a Merchant; and, at his Death, left her a large
Fortune, and so considerable a Jointure to his
Wife, that the Duke of—, being then a Wi∣dower,
was tempted to make his Addresses to
her. Mrs. <HI>Groves</HI> was one of the proudest Wo∣men
in the World; and, this Offer flattering
her Ambition more than ever she had Reason to
expect, she married the Duke after a very short
Courtship; and carried Miss <HI>Groves</HI> down with
her to—, where the Duke had a fine Seat,
and where she was received by his Grace's
Daughters, who were much about her own Age,
with great Civility. Miss <HI>Groves,</HI> Madam, was
then about twelve Years old, and was educated
<PB N="105" REF="121"/>
with the Duke's Daughters, who, in a little
time, became quite disgusted with their new
Sister; for Miss <HI>Groves,</HI> who inherited her Mo∣ther's
Pride, tho' not her Understanding, in all
things affected an Equality with those young
Ladies, who, conscious of the Superiority of
their Birth, could but ill bear with her Insolence
and Presumption. As they grew older, the Dif∣ference
of their Inclinations caused perpetual
Quarrels amongst them; for his Grace's Daugh∣ters
were serious, reserved, and pious. Miss
<HI>Groves</HI> affected noisy Mirth, was a great Romp,
and delighted in masculine Exercises.</P>
<P>The Duchess was often reflected on for suf∣fering
her Daughter, without any other Com∣pany
than two or three Servants, to spend great
Part of the Day in riding about the Country,
leaping over Hedges and Ditches, exposing her
fair Face to the Injuries of the Sun and Wind;
and, by those coarse Exercises, contracting a
masculine and robust Air not becoming her Sex,
and tender Years: Yet she could not be prevailed
upon to restrain her from this Diversion, till it
was reported, she had listened to the Addresses
of a young Sportsman, who used to mix in her
Train, when she went upon those Rambles, and
procured frequent Opportunities of conversing
with her.</P>
<P>There is a great Difference, interrupted <HI>Ara∣bella,</HI>
in suffering Addresses, and being betrayed
into an involuntary Hearing of them, and this
last, I conceive to have been the Case of your
Lady; for it is not very probable, she would
so far forget what she owed to her own Glory,
<PB N="106" REF="122"/>
as to be induced to listen quietly to Discourses
like those you mention.</P>
<P>However, Madam, resumed Mrs. <HI>Morris,</HI>
the Duchess thought it necessary to keep her
more at home; but, even here, she was not
without meeting Adventures, and found a Lo∣ver
in the Person who taught her to write.</P>
<P>That, indeed, was a very notable Adventure,
said <HI>Arabella;</HI> but it is not strange, that Love
should produce such Metamorphoses: 'Tis not
very long ago, that I heard of a Man of Qua∣lity,
who disguised himself in a poor Habit, and
worked in the Gardens of a certain Nobleman,
whose Daughter he was enamoured with: These
things happen every Day.</P>
<P>The Person I speak of, Madam, said Mrs.
<HI>Morris,</HI> was never discovered to be any thing
better than a Writing-master; and yet, for all
that, Miss was <HI>smitten</HI> with his fine Person, and
was taking Measures to run away with him,
when the Intrigue was discovered, the Lover
dismissed, and the young Lady, whose faulty
Conduct had drawn upon her her Mother's Dis∣like,
was sent up to <HI>London,</HI> and allowed to be
her own Mistress at Sixteen; to which unpar∣donable
Neglect of her Mother she owes the
Misfortunes that have since befallen her.</P>
<P>Whatever may be the common Opinion of
this Matter, interrupted <HI>Arabella</HI> again, I am
persuaded the Writing-master, as you call him,
was some Person of Quality, who made use of
that Device to get Access to his beautiful Mistress.
Love is ingenious in Artifices: Who would
have thought, that, under the Name of <HI>Alcippus,</HI>
a simple Attendant of the fair <HI>Artemisa</HI> Princess
<PB N="107" REF="123"/>
of <HI>Armenia,</HI> the gallant <HI>Alexander</HI> Son of the great
and unfortunate <HI>Antony,</HI> by Queen <HI>Clcopatra,</HI>
was concealed, who took upon himself that
mean Condition for the sake of seeing his adored
Princess? Yet the Contrivance of <HI>Orontes,</HI> Prince
of the <HI>Massagetes,</HI> was far more ingenious, and
even dangerous; for this valiant and young
Prince, happening to see the Picture of the beau∣tiful
<HI>Thalestris,</HI> Daughter of the Queen of the
<HI>Amazons,</HI> he fell passionately in Love with her;
and, knowing that the Entrance into that Coun∣try
was forbid to Men, he dressed himself in
Womens Apparel; and, finding means to be
introduced to the Queen, and her fair Daughter,
whose Amity he gained by some very singular
Services in the Wars, he lived several Years un∣discovered
in their Court: I see, therefore, no
Reason to the contrary, but that this Writing-master
might have been some illustrious Person,
whom Love had disguised; and, I am persuaded,
added she, smiling, that I shall hear more of him
anon, in a very different Character.</P>
<P>Indeed, Madam, said Mrs. <HI>Morris,</HI> whom
this Speech of <HI>Arabella</HI> had extremely surprised,
I never heard any thing more about him, than
what I have related; and, for what I know, he
continues still to teach Writing; for I don't sup∣pose
the Duchess's Displeasure could affect
him.</P>
<P>How is it possible, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> that you
can suppose such an Offence to Probability? In
my Opinion, 'tis much more likely, that this
unfortunate Lover is dead thro' Despair; or,
perhaps, wandering over the World in Search
<PB N="108" REF="124"/>
of that Fair one, who was snatched from his
Hopes.</P>
<P>If it was his Design to seek for her, Madam,
resumed Mrs. <HI>Morris,</HI> he need not have gone
far, since she was only sent to <HI>London,</HI> whither
he might easily have followed her.</P>
<P>There is no accounting for these Things, said
<HI>Arabella:</HI> Perhaps he has been imposed upon, and
made to believe, that it was she herself that ba∣nished
him from her Presence: 'Tis probable too,
that he was jealous, and thought she preferred
some one of his Rivals to him. Jealousy is insepara∣ble
from true Love; and the slightest Matters ima∣ginable
will occasion it: And, what is still more
wonderful, this Passion creates the greatest Dis∣orders
in the most sensible and delicate Hearts.
Never was there a more refined and faithful
Passion, than that of the renowned <HI>Artamenes</HI> for
<HI>Mandana;</HI> and yet this Prince was driven al∣most
to Distraction by a Smile, which, he fan∣sied,
he saw in the Face of his Divine Mistress,
at a time when she had some Reason to believe
he was dead; and he was so transported with
Grief and Rage, that, tho' he was a Prisoner in
his Enemy's Camp, where the Knowledge of his
Quality would have procured him certain Death,
yet he determined to hazard all Things for the
fake of presenting himself before <HI>Mandana,</HI> and
upbraiding her with her Infidelity; when, in
Reality, nothing was farther from the Thoughts
of that fair and virtuous Princess, than the Light∣ness
he accused her of: So that, as I said before,
it is not at all to be wondered at, if this disguised
Lover of your Lady was driven to Despair by
Suspicions as groundless, perhaps, as those of
<PB N="109" REF="125"/>
<HI>Artamenes,</HI> yet not the less cruel and torment∣ing.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Morris,</HI> finding <HI>Arabella</HI> held her Peace
at these Words, went on with her History in
this manner:—Miss <HI>Groves,</HI> Madam, being
directed by her Woman in all things, took up
her Lodgings in her Father's House, who was a
broken Tradesman, and obliged to keep himself
concealed for fear of his Creditors: Here she
formed her Equipage, which consisted of a
Chair, one Footman, a Cook, and her Wo∣man:
As she was indulged with the Command
of what Money she pleased, her Extravagance
was boundless: She lavished away large Sums
at Gaming, which was her favourite Diversion;
kept such a Number of different Animals for
Favourites, that their Maintenance amounted
to a considerable Sum every Year: Her Wo∣man's
whole Family were supported at her Ex∣pence;
and, as she frequented all public Places,
and surpassed Ladies of the first Quality in Fine∣ry,
her Dress alone consumed great Part of her
Income. I need not tell you, Madam, that my
Lady was a celebrated Beauty: You have your∣self
been pleased to say, that she is very hand∣some.
When she first appeared at Court, her
Beauty, and the uncommon Dignity of her Per∣son,
at such early Years, made her the Object
of general Admiration. The King was particu∣larly
struck with her; and declared to those about
him, that Miss <HI>Groves</HI> was the finest Woman
at Court. The Ladies, however, found means
to explain away all that was flattering in this
Distinction: They said, Miss <HI>Groves</HI> was clumsy;
and it was her Resemblance to the <HI>unwieldy Ger∣man</HI>
<PB N="110" REF="126"/>
Ladies that made her so much admired by
his Majesty. Her Pride, and the Quality Airs
she affected, were the Subject of great Ridicule
to those that envied her Charms: Some Cen∣sures
were maliciously cast on her Birth; for,
as she was always styled the Duchess of—'s
Daughter, a Custom she introduced herself, she
seemed to disclaim all Title to a legal Father.
Miss <HI>Groves,</HI> as universally admired as she was,
yet made but very few particular Conquests.
Her Fortune was known to be very considerable,
and her Mother's Jointure was to descend to her
after her Death: Yet there was no Gentleman,
who would venture upon a Wife of Miss <HI>Groves</HI>'s
Taste for Expence, as very few Estates, <HI>to which
she could pretend,</HI> would support her Extrava∣gance.
—The Honourable Mr. <HI>L</HI>—Brother
to the Earl of—, was the only one, amidst
a Croud of Admirers, who made any particular
Address to her. This Gentleman was tolera∣bly
handsome, and had the Art of making him∣self
agreeable to the Ladies, by a certain Air of
Softness and Tenderness, which never failed to
make some Impression upon those he desired to
deceive.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Groves</HI> was ravished with her Conquest,
and boasted of it so openly, that People, who
were acquainted with this Gentleman's Cha∣racter,
foreseeing her Fate, could not help pi∣tying
her.</P>
<P>A very few Months Courtship completed
the Ruin of poor Miss <HI>Groves:</HI> She fell a Sacri∣fice
to Oaths which had been often prostituted
for the same inhuman Purposes; and became
so fond of her Betrayer, that it was with great
<PB N="111" REF="127"/>
Difficulty he could persuade her not to give him,
even in public, the most ridiculous Proofs of
her <HI>Tenderness.</HI> Her Woman pretends, that she
was ignorant of this Intrigue, till Miss <HI>Groves</HI>
growing big with Child, it could no longer be
concealed; it was at length agreed, she should
lie-in at her own Lodgings, to prevent any Su∣spicions
from her retreating into the Country;
but that Scheme was over-ruled by her Wo∣man's
Mother, who advised her to conceal her∣self
in some Village, not far from Town, till
the Affair was over.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Groves</HI> approved of this second Proposal,
but took Advantage of her Shape, which, being
far from delicate, would not easily discover any
growing Bigness, to stay in Town as long as
she possibly could. When her Removal was
necessary, she went to the Lodgings provided for
her, a few Miles distant from <HI>London:</HI> And,
notwithstanding the Excuses which were framed
for this sudden Absence, the true Cause was
more than suspected by some busy People, who
industriously inquired into her Affairs.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>L</HI>—saw her but seldom during her Ill∣ness:
The Fear of being discovered was his Pre∣tence:
But her Friends easily saw through this
Disguise, and were persuaded Miss <HI>Groves</HI> was
waning in his Affections.</P>
<P>As she had a very strong Constitution, she re∣turned
to Town at the End of three Weeks:
The Child was dead, and she looked hand∣somer
than ever. Mr. <HI>L</HI>—continued his Vi∣sits;
and the Town to make Remarks of
them. All this time the Duchess never trou∣bled
herself about the Conduct of this unfortu∣nate
<PB N="112" REF="128"/>
young Creature: And the People she was
with had not the Goodness to give her any Hint
of her Misconduct, and the Waste of her For∣tune:
On the contrary, they almost turned her
Head with their Flatteries, preyed upon her
Fortune, and winked at her Irregularities.</P>
<P>She was now a second time with Child: Her
Character was pretty severely handled by her
Enemies: Mr. <HI>L</HI>—began openly to slight her:
And she was now several thousand Pounds in
Debt. The Mother and Sisters of her Woman,
in whose House she still was, were base enough
to whisper the Fault she had been guilty of to
all their Acquaintances. Her Story became ge∣nerally
known: She was shunned and neglected
by every body; and even Mr. <HI>L</HI>—, who had
been the Cause of her Ruin, intirely abandoned
her, and boasted openly of the Favours he had
received from her.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Groves</HI> protested to her Friends, That
he had promised her Marriage; but Mr. <HI>L</HI>—constantly
denied it, and never scrupled to say,
when he was questioned about it, That he found
Miss <HI>Groves</HI> too easy a Conquest to make any
Perjury necessary. Her Tenderness, however,
for this base Man, was so great, that she never
could bear to hear him railed at in her Presence;
but would quarrel with the only Friends she had
left, if they said any thing to his Disadvantage.
As she was now pretty far advanced with Child,
she would have retired into the Country; but
the bad Condition of her Affairs made her Re∣moval
impossible: In this Extremity she had
Recourse to her Uncle, a rich Merchant in the
City, who, having taken all the necessary Pre∣cautions
<PB N="113" REF="129"/>
for his own Security, paid Miss <HI>Groves</HI>'s
Debts, carrying on, in her Name, a Law-suit
with the Duchess, for some Lands, which were
to be put into her Hands, when she was of Age,
and which that great Lady detained. Miss
<HI>Groves,</HI> being reduced to live upon something
less than an Hundred a Year, quitted <HI>London,</HI>
and came into this Part of the Country, where
she was received by Mrs. <HI>Barnett,</HI> one of her
Woman's Sisters, who is married to a Country
Gentleman of some Fortune: In her House she
lay-in of a Girl, which Mr. <HI>L</HI>—sent to de∣mand,
and will not be persuaded to inform her
how, or in what manner, he has disposed of the
Child.</P>
<P>Her former Woman leaving her, I was re∣ceived
in her Place, from whom I learnt all
these Particulars: And Miss <HI>Groves</HI> having
gained the Affections of Mr. <HI>Barnett</HI>'s Brother,
her Beauty, and the large Fortune which she
has in Reversion, has induced him, notwith∣standing
the Knowledge of her past unhappy Con∣duct,
to marry her. But their Marriage is yet
a Secret, Miss <HI>Groves</HI> being apprehensive of her
Uncle's Displeasure for not consulting him in
her Choice.</P>
<P>Her Husband is gone to <HI>London,</HI> with an
Intention to acquaint him with it; and, when
he returns, their Marriage will be publicly
owned.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Containing what a judicious Reader will
hardly approve.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MRS. <HI>Morris</HI> ending her Narration,
<HI>Arabella,</HI> who had not been able to
restrain her Tears at some Parts of it, thanked
her for the Trouble she had been at; and as∣sured
her of her Secrecy: Your Lady's Case,
said she, is much to be lamented; and greatly
resembles the unfortunate <HI>Cleopatra</HI>'s, whom
<HI>Julius Caesar</HI> privately marrying, with a Promise
to own her for his Wife, when he should be
peaceable Master of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, left
that great Queen big with Child, and, never in∣tending
to perform his Promise, suffered her to
be exposed to the Censures the World has so
freely cast upon her; and which she so little
deserved.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Morris,</HI> seeing the favourable Light in
which <HI>Arabella</HI> viewed the Actions of her Lady,
did not think proper to say any thing to unde∣ceive
her; but went out of the Closet, not a
little mortified at her Disappointment: For she
saw she was likely to receive nothing for betray∣ing
her Lady's Secrets, from <HI>Arabella:</HI> Who
seemed so little sensible of the Pleasure of Scan∣dal,
as to be wholly ignorant of its Nature; and
not to know it when it was told her.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Groves,</HI> who was just come to Lady
<HI>Bella</HI>'s Chamber-door, to inquire for her, was
surprised to see her Woman come out of it;
<PB N="115" REF="131"/>
and who, upon meeting her, expressed great
Confusion. As she was going to ask her some
Questions concerning her Business there, <HI>Ara∣bella</HI>
came out of her Closet; and, seeing
Miss <HI>Groves</HI> in her Chamber, asked her Pardon
for staying so long from her.</P>
<P>I have been listening to your History, said
she, with great Frankness, which your Woman
has been relating: And I assure you I am ex∣tremely
sensible of your Misfortunes.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Groves,</HI> at these Words, blushed with
extreme Confusion; and Mrs. <HI>Morris</HI> turned
pale with Astonishment and Fear. <HI>Arabella,</HI>
not sensible that she had been guilty of any In∣discretion,
proceeded to make Reflections upon
some Part of her Story; which, though they
were not at all disadvantageous to that young
Lady, she received as so many Insults: And
asked Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> If she was not ashamed to
tamper with a Servant to betray the Secrets of
her Mistress?</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> a little surprised at so rude a Que∣stion,
answered, however, with great Sweetness;
and protested to her, that she would make no
ill Use of what she had learned of her Affairs:
For, in fine, Madam, said she, do you think I
am less fit to be trusted with your Secrets, than
the Princess of the <HI>Leontines</HI> was with those of
<HI>Clelia;</HI> between whom there was no greater
Amity and Acquaintance, than with us? And
you must certainly know, that the Secrets which
that admirable Person entrusted with <HI>Lysimena,</HI>
were of a Nature to be more dangerous, if re∣vealed,
than yours. The Happiness of <HI>Clelia</HI>
depended upon <HI>Lysimena</HI>'s Fidelity: And the
<PB N="116" REF="132"/>
Liberty, nay, haply, the Life, of <HI>Aronces,</HI> would
have been in Danger, if she had betrayed them.
Though I do not intend to arrogate to myself
the Possession of those admirable Qualities which
adorned the Princess of the <HI>Leontines,</HI> yet I will
not yield to her, or any one else, in Generosity
and Fidelity: And if you will be pleased to re∣pose
as much Confidence in me, as those illustri∣ous
Lovers did in her, you shall be convinced I
will <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>abour as earnestly for your Interest, as that
fair Princess did for those of <HI>Aronces</HI> and <HI>Clelia.</HI></P>
<P>Miss <HI>Groves</HI> was so busied in reflecting upon
the Baseness of her Woman in exposing her,
that she heard not a Word of this fine Harangue
(at which Mrs. <HI>Morris,</HI> notwithstanding the
Cause she had for Uneasiness, could hardly help
laughing); but, assuming some of that Haughti∣ness
in her Looks, for which she used to be re∣markable,
she told Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> that she imputed
her impertinent Curiosity to her Country Igno∣rance,
and ill Breeding: And she did not doubt
but she would be served in her own kind, and
meet with as bad Fortune as she had done; and,
perhaps, deserve it <HI>worse</HI> than she did: For
there are more false Men in the World besides
Mr. <HI>L</HI>—; and she was no handsomer than
other People.</P>
<P>Saying this, she flung out of the Room, her
Woman following, leaving <HI>Arabella</HI> in such
Confusion at a Behaviour of which she had
never before had an Idea, that for some Mo∣ments
she remained immoveable.</P>
<P>Recollecting herself, at last, and conceiving,
that Civility required she should endeavour to
appease this incensed Lady, she went down
<PB N="117" REF="133"/>
Stairs after her; and, stopping her just as she
was going out of the House, intreated her to be
calm, and suffer her to vindicate herself from
the Imputation of being impertinently curious
to know her Affairs.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Groves,</HI> quite transported with Shame
and Anger, refused absolutely to stay.</P>
<P>At least, Madam, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> stay till
my Coach can be got ready; and don't think
of walking home, so slightly attended.</P>
<P>This Offer was as sullenly answered as the
other: And <HI>Arabella,</HI> finding she was deter∣mined
to venture home, with no other Guard
than her Woman, who silently followed her,
ordered two of her Footmen to attend her at
a small Distance; and to defend her, if there
should be Occasion.</P>
<P>For who knows, said she to <HI>Lucy,</HI> what Ac∣cident
may happen? Some one or other of her
insolent Lovers may take this Opportunity to
carry her away; and I should never forgive
myself for being the Cause of such a Misfortune
to her.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Morris</HI> having found it easy to recon∣cile
herself to her Lady, by assuring her, that
Lady <HI>Bella</HI> was acquainted with great Part of
her Story before; and that what she told her,
tended only to justify her Conduct, as she might
have been convinced by what Lady <HI>Bella</HI> said;
they both went home with a Resolution to say
nothing of what had passed, with relation to the
Cause of the Disgust Miss <HI>Groves</HI> had received:
But only said, in general, that Lady <HI>Bella</HI> was
the most ridiculous Creature in the World; and
<PB N="118" REF="134"/>
was so totally ignorant of good Breeding, that
it was impossible to converse with her.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Which treats of the Olympic Games.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHILE <HI>Arabella</HI> was ruminating on
the unaccountable Behaviour of her
new Acquaintance, she received a Letter from
her Uncle, informing her (for she had ex∣presly
forbid Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> to write to her), that
his Son and Daughter intended to set out for her
Seat in a few Days.</P>
<P>This News was received with great Satis∣faction
by <HI>Arabella,</HI> who hoped to find an
agreeable Companion in her Cousin; and was
not so insensible of Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>'s Merit, as
not to feel some kind of Pleasure at the Thought
of seeing him again.</P>
<P>This Letter was soon followed, by the Arri∣val
of Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> and his Sister; who, upon
the Sight of <HI>Arabella,</HI> discovered some Ap∣pearance
of Astonishment and Chagrin; for,
notwithstanding all her Brother had told her of
her Accomplishments, she could not conceive
it possible for a young Lady, bred up in the
Country, to be so perfectly elegant and gen∣teel
as she found her Cousin.</P>
<P>As Miss <HI>Charlotte</HI> had a large Share of Co∣quetry
in her Composition, and was fond of
Beauty in none of her own Sex but herself, she
<PB N="119" REF="135"/>
was sorry to see Lady <HI>Bella</HI> possessed of so great
a Share; and, being in Hopes her Brother had
drawn a flattering Figure of her Cousin, she
was extremely disappointed at finding the Ori∣ginal
so handsome.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> on the contrary, was highly pleased
with Miss <HI>Glanville;</HI> and, finding her Person
very agreeable, did not fail to commend her
Beauty: A sort of Complaisance mightily in
Use among the Heroines, who knew not what
Envy or Emulation meant.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> received her Praises with
great Politeness, but could not find in her Heart
to return them: And, as soon as these Com∣pliments
were over, Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> told Lady
<HI>Bella,</HI> how tedious he had found the short Ab∣sence
she had forced him to, and how great was
his Satisfaction at seeing her again.</P>
<P>I shall not dispute the Truth of your last As∣sertion,
replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> smiling, since I verily
believe, you are mighty well satisfied at pre∣sent;
but I know not how you will make it ap∣pear,
that an Absence, which you allow to be
short, has seemed so tedious to you; for this is
a manifest Contradiction: However, pursued
she, preventing his Reply, you look so well,
and so much at Ease, that I am apt to believe,
Absence has agreed very well with you.</P>
<P>And yet I assure you, Madam, said Mr. <HI>Glan∣ville,</HI>
interrupting her, that I have suffered more
Uneasiness during this Absence, than I fear you
will permit me to tell you.</P>
<P>Since, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> that Uneasiness has
neither made you thinner, nor paler, I don't
think you ought to be pitied: For, to say the
<PB N="120" REF="136"/>
Truth, in these Sort of Matters, a Person's bare
Testimony has but little Weight.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> was going to make her some
Answer; when Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> who, while they
had been speaking, was adjusting her Dress at
the Glass, came up to them, and made the
Conversation more general.</P>
<P>After Dinner, they adjourned to the Gardens,
where the gay Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> running eagerly
from one Walk to another, gave her Brother
as many Opportunities of talking to Lady <HI>Bella</HI>
as he could wish: However, he stood in such
Awe of her, and dreaded so much another
Banishment, that he did not dare, otherwise
than by distant Hints, to mention his Passion;
and <HI>Arabella,</HI> well enough pleased with a Re∣spect
that in some measure came up to her Ex∣pectation,
discovered no Resentment at Insinu∣ations
she was at Liberty to dissemble the Know∣lege
of: And if he could not, by her Behaviour,
flatter himself with any great Hopes, yet he
found as little Reason, in <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Language,
to despair.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> at the End of a few Weeks,
was so tired of the magnificent Solitude she
lived in, that she heartily repented her Journey;
and insinuated to her Brother, her Inclination
to return to Town.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> knowing his Stay was regu∣lated
by his Sister's, intreated her not to expose
him to the Mortification of leaving <HI>Arabella</HI> so
soon; and promised her he would contrive some
Amusements for her, which should make her
relish the Country better than she had yet done.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="137"/>
Accordingly, he proposed to <HI>Arabella</HI> to go
to the Races, which were to be held at—a
few Miles from the Castle: She would have
excused herself, upon account of her Mourn∣ing;
but Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> discovered so great an
Inclination to be present at this Diversion, that
<HI>Arabella</HI> could no longer refuse to accompany
her.</P>
<P>Since, said she to Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> you are
fond of public Diversions, it happens very
luckily, that these Races are to be held at the
Time you are here: I never heard of them before,
and I presume 'tis a good many Years since they
were last celebrated. Pray, Sir, pursued she,
turning to <HI>Glanville,</HI> do not these Races, in
some Degree, resemble the <HI>Olympic</HI> Games? Do
the Candidates ride in Chariots?</P>
<P>No, Madam, replied <HI>Glanville;</HI> the Jockeys
are mounted upon the fleetest Coursers they can
procure; and he who first reaches the Goal ob∣tains
the Prize.</P>
<P>And who is the fair Lady that is to bestow it?
resumed <HI>Arabella:</HI> I dare engage one of her
Lovers will enter the Lists; she will, doubtless,
be in no less Anxiety than he; and the Shame
of being overcome, will hardly affect him with
more Concern, than herself; that is, provided
he be so happy as to have gained her Affections.
I cannot help thinking the fair <HI>Elismonda</HI> was
extremely happy in this Particular: For she had
the Satisfaction to see her secret Admirer Victor
in all the Exercises at the <HI>Olympic</HI> Games, and
carry away the Prize from many Princes, and
Persons of rare Quality, who were Candidates
with him; and he had also the Glory to receive
<PB N="122" REF="138"/>
three Crowns in one Day, from the Hands of
his adored Princess; who, questionless, be∣stowed
them upon him with an infinite deal of
Joy.</P>
<P>What Sort of Races were those, Madam?
said Miss <HI>Glanville;</HI> whose Reading had been
very confined.</P>
<P>The <HI>Olympic</HI> Games, Miss, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> so
called from <HI>Olympia,</HI> a City near which they
were performed, in the Plains of <HI>Elis,</HI> consisted
of Foot and Chariot-Races; Combats with the
Cestus; Wrestling, and other Sports. They
were instituted in Honour of the Gods and
Heroes; and were therefore termed sacred, and
were considered as a Part of Religion.</P>
<P>They were a kind of School, or military Ap∣prenticeship;
in which the Courage of the Youth
found constant Employment: And the Reason
why Victory in those Games was attended with
such extraordinary Applause, was, that their
Minds might be quickened with great and noble
Prospects, when, in this Image of War, they
arrived to a Pitch of Glory, approaching, in
some respects, to that of the most famous Con∣querors.
They thought this Sort of Triumph
one of the greatest Parts of Happiness of which
Human Nature was capable: So that when
<HI>Diagoras</HI> had seen his Sons crowned in the
<HI>Olympic</HI> Games, one of his Friends made him
this Compliment, Now, <HI>Diagoras,</HI> you may die
satisfied; since you can't be a God. It would
tire you, perhaps, was I to describe all the Ex∣ercises
performed there: But you may form a
general Notion of them, from what you have
doubtless read of Justs and Tournaments.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="139"/>
Really, said Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> I never read
about any such Things.</P>
<P>No! replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> surprised: Well, then,
I must tell you, that they hold a middle Place,
between a Diversion and a Combat; but the
<HI>Olympic</HI> Games were attended with a much
greater Pomp and Variety: And not only all
<HI>Greece,</HI> but other neighbouring Nations, were
in a manner drained, to furnish out the Ap∣pearance.</P>
<P>Well, for my Part, said Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> I
never before heard of these Sort of Races; those
I have been at were quite different. I know
the Prizes and Bets are sometimes very con∣siderable.</P>
<P>And, doubtless, interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> there
are a great many Heroes who signalize them∣selves
at these Races; not for the sake of the
Prize, which would be unworthy of great Souls,
but to satisfy that burning Desire of Glory,
which spurs them on to every Occasion of gain∣ing
it.</P>
<P>As for the Heroes, or Jockeys, said Miss
<HI>Glanville,</HI> call them what you please, I believe
they have very little Share, either of the Profit
or Glory: For their Masters have the one, and
the Horses the other.</P>
<P>Their Masters! interrupted <HI>Arabella:</HI> What,
I suppose, a great many foreign Princes send their
Favourites to Combat, in their Name? I re∣member
to have read, that <HI>Alcibiades</HI> triumphed
three times successively at the <HI>Olympic</HI> Games,
by means of one of his Domestics, who, in his
Master's Name, entered the Lists.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="140"/>
Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> fearing his Sister would make
some absurd Answer, and thereby disoblige his
Cousin, took up the Discourse: And, turning
it upon the <HI>Grecian</HI> History, engrossed her Con∣versation,
for two Hours, wholly to himself;
while Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> (to whom all they said was
quite unintelligible) diverted herself with hum∣ming
a Tune, and tinkling her Cousin's Harp∣sichord;
which proved no Interruption to the
more rational Entertainment of her Brother and
<HI>Arabella.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Which concludes with an excellent moral
Sentence.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Day being come on which they de∣signed
to be present at the Races (or, as
<HI>Arabella</HI> called them, the <HI>Games</HI>), Miss <HI>Glan∣ville,</HI>
having spent four long Hours in dressing
herself to the greatest Advantage, in order, if
possible, to eclipse her lovely Cousin, whose
Mourning, being much deeper, was less capable
of Ornaments, came into her Chamber; and,
finding her still in her Morning Dress, For
Heaven's sake, Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> said she, when do
you purpose to be ready? Why it is almost
time to be gone, my Brother says, and here
you are not a bit dressed!</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="141"/>
Don't be uneasy, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> smiling; and,
going to her Toilet, I shan't make you wait
long.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> seating herself near the Table,
resolved to be present while her Cousin was
dressing, that she might have an Opportunity to
make some Remarks to her Disadvantage: But
she was extremely mortified, to observe the
Haste and Negligence she made her Women
use in this important Employment; and that,
notwithstanding her Indifference, nothing could
appear more lovely and genteel.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> however, pleased herself with
the Certainty of seeing her Cousin's Dress ex∣tremely
ridiculed, for the peculiar Fashion of
her Gown: And the Veil, which, as becoming as
it was, would, by its Novelty, occasion great
Diversion among the Ladies, helped to comfort
her for the Superiority of her Charms; which,
partial as she was to her own, she could not help
secretly confessing.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> being dressed in much less time
than her Cousin, Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> was admitted,
who led her down Stairs to her Coach, which
was waiting: His Sister (secretly repin∣ing
at the Advantage <HI>Arabella</HI> had over her,
in having so respectful an Adorer) followed:
And, being placed in the Coach, they set out
with great Appearance of Good-humour on all
Sides.</P>
<P>They got to—but just time enough to
see the Beginning of the first Course: <HI>Arabella,</HI>
who fansied the Jockeys were Persons of great
Distinction, soon became interested in the Fate
of one of them, whose Appearance pleased her
<PB N="126" REF="142"/>
more than the others. Accordingly, she made
Vows for his Success, and appeared so extremely
rejoiced at the Advantage he had gained, that
Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> maliciously told her, People
would make Remarks at the Joy she expressed,
and fansy she had a more than ordinary Interest
in that Jockey, who had first reached the Goal.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> whom this impertinent Insinu∣ation
of his Sister had filled with Confusion
and Spite, sat biting his Lips, trembling for
the Effect it would produce in <HI>Arabella:</HI> But
she, giving quite another Turn to her Cousin's
Words, I assure you, said she, with a Smile,
I am not any further interested in the Fate of
this Person, who has hitherto been successful,
than what the Handsomeness of his Garb, and
the Superiority of his Skill, may demand, from
an unprejudiced Spectator: And, though I per∣ceive
you imagine he is some concealed Lover
of mine, yet I don't remember to have ever
seen him: And I am confident it is not for my
sake that he entered the Lists; nor is it my
Presence which animates him.</P>
<P>Lord bless me, Madam! replied Miss <HI>Glan∣ville,</HI>
Who would ever think of such strange
things as these you talk of? No-body will pre∣tend
to deny that you are very handsome, to be
sure; but yet, thank Heaven, the Sight of you
is not so dangerous, but that such sort of Peo∣ple,
as these are, may escape your Chains.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> was so wholly taken up with the
Event of the Races, that she gave but very little
Heed to this sarcastic Answer of Miss <HI>Glanville;</HI>
whose Brother, taking Advantage of an Oppor∣tunity
which <HI>Arabella</HI> gave him by putting her
<PB N="127" REF="143"/>
Head quite out of the Coach, chid her very se∣verely
for the Liberty she took with her Cousin.
<HI>Arabella,</HI> by looking earnestly out of the Win∣dow,
had given so full a View of her fine Per∣son
to a young Baronet, who was not many
Paces from the Coach, that, being struck with
Admiration at the Sight of so lovely a Creature,
he was going up to some of her Attendants to
ask who she was, when he perceived Mr. <HI>Glan∣ville,</HI>
with whom he was intimately acquainted,
in the Coach with her: Immediately he made
himself known to his Friend, being excessively
rejoiced at having got an Opportunity of be∣ginning
an Acquaintance with a Lady whose
Sight had so charmed him.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who had observed the pro∣found
Bow he made to <HI>Arabella,</HI> accompanied
with a Glance that shewed an extreme Admi∣ration
of her, was very little pleased at this
Meeting; yet he dissembled his Thoughts well
enough in his Reception of him. But Miss
<HI>Glanville</HI> was quite overjoyed, hoping she would
now have her Turn of Gallantry and Compli∣ment:
Therefore, accosting him in her free Man∣ner,
Dear Sir <HI>George,</HI> said she, you come in a
lucky Time to brighten up the Conversation:
Relations are such dull Company for one an∣other,
'tis half a Minute since we have ex∣changed
a Word.</P>
<P>My Cousin, said <HI>Arabella</HI> smiling, has so
strange a Disposition for Mirth, that she thinks
all her Moments are lost, in which she finds
nothing to laugh at: For my Part, I do so
earnestly long to know, to which of these Pre∣tenders
Fortune will give the Victory, that I
<PB N="128" REF="144"/>
can suffer my Cares for them to receive no In∣terruption
from my Cousin's agreeable Gaiety.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> observing the Baronet gazed
upon <HI>Arabella</HI> earnestly while she was speaking
those few Words, resolved to hinder him from
making any Reply, by asking him several Que∣stions
concerning the Racers, their Owners, and
the Bets which were laid; to which <HI>Arabella</HI>
added, And pray, Sir, said she, do me the Fa∣vour
to tell me, if you know who that gallant
Man is, who has already won the first Course.</P>
<P>I don't know really, Madam, said Sir <HI>George,</HI>
what his Name is, extremely surprised at her
Manner of asking.</P>
<P>The Jockey had now gained the Goal a Se∣cond
time; and <HI>Arabella</HI> could not conceal her
Satisfaction. Questionless, said she, he is a
very extraordinary Person; but I am afraid we
shall not have the Pleasure of knowing who he
is; for if he has any Reason for keeping himself
concealed, he will evade any Inquiries after him,
by slipping out of the Lists while this Hurry and
Tumult lasts, as <HI>Hortensius</HI> did at the <HI>Olympic</HI>
Games; yet, notwithstanding all his Care, he
was discovered by being obliged to fight a single
Combat with one of the Persons whom he had
worsted at those Games.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who saw his Sister, by her lit∣tle
Coquetries with Sir <HI>George,</HI> had prevented
him from hearing great Part of this odd Speech,
proposed returning to the Castle; to which <HI>Ara∣bella</HI>
agreed: But, conceiving Civility obliged
her to offer the Convenience of a Lodging to a
Stranger of Sir <HI>George</HI>'s Appearance, and who
was an Acquaintance of her Cousins, You must
<PB N="129" REF="145"/>
permit me, said she to Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> to in∣treat
your noble Friend will accompany us to
the Castle, where he will meet with better Ac∣commodations
than at any Inn he can find; for
I conceive, that, coming only to be a Spectator
of these Games, he is wholly unprovided with
a Lodging.</P>
<P>The Baronet, surprised at so uncommon a
Civility, was at a Loss what Answer to make
her at first; but, recollecting himself, he told
her that he would, if she pleased, do himself the
Honour to attend her home; but, as his House
was at no great Distance from—, he would
be put to no Inconveniency for a Lodging.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> who was not willing to part
so soon with the Baronet, insisted, with her
Cousin's Leave, upon his coming into the
Coach; which he accordingly did, giving his
Horse to the Care of his Servant; and they pro∣ceeded
together to the Castle; <HI>Arabella</HI> still
continuing to talk of the Games, as she called
them, while poor <HI>Glanville,</HI> who was excessively
confused, endeavoured to change the Discourse,
not without an Apprehension, that every Sub∣iect
he could think of, would afford <HI>Arabella</HI> an
Occasion of shewing her Foible; which, not∣withstanding
the Pain it gave him, could not
lessen the Love he felt for her.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George,</HI> whose Admiration of Lady <HI>Bella</HI>
increased the longer he saw her, was extremely
pleased with the Opportunity she had given him
of cultivating an Acquaintance with her: He
therefore lengthened out his Visit, in hopes of
being able to say some fine Things to her before
he went away; but Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> who strove
<PB N="130" REF="146"/>
by all the little Arts she was Mistress of, to en∣gage
his Conversation wholly to herself, put it
absolutely out of his Power; so that he was
obliged to take his Leave without having the
Satisfaction of even pressing the fair Hand of
<HI>Arabella;</HI> so closely was he observed by her Cou∣sin.
Happy was it for him, that he was pre∣vented
by her Vigilance from attempting a Piece
of Gallantry, which would, undoubtedly, have
procured him a Banishment from her Presence;
but, ignorant, how kind Fortune was to him in
balking his Designs, he was ungrateful enough
to go away in a mighty ill Humour with this
fickle Goddess: So little capable are poor Mor∣tals
of knowing what is best for them!</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Containing some curious Anecdotes.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>LADY <HI>Bella,</HI> from the Familiarity with
which Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> treated this gay Gen∣tleman,
concluding him her Lover, and one
who was apparently well received by her, had a
strong Curiosity to know her Adventures; and
as they were walking the next Morning in the
Garden, she told her, that she thought it was
very strange they had hitherto observed such a Re∣serve
to each other, as to banish mutual Trust and
Confidence from their Conversation: Whence
comes it, Cousin, added she, being so young and
lovely as you are, that you, questionless, have
been engaged in many Adventures, you have
<PB N="131" REF="147"/>
never reposed Trust enough in me to savour me
with a Recital of them?</P>
<P>Engaged in many Adventures, Madam! re∣turned
Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> not liking the Phrase:
I believe I have been engaged in as few as your
Ladyship.</P>
<P>You are too obliging, returned <HI>Arabella,</HI>
who mistook what she said for a Compliment;
for since you have more Beauty than I, and
have also had more Opportunities of making
yourself beloved, questionless you have a
greater Number of Admirers.</P>
<P>As for Admirers, said Miss <HI>Charlotte</HI> bridling,
I fansy I have had my Share! Thank God, I
never found myself neglected; but, I assure
you, Madam, I have had no Adventures, as
you call them, with any of them.</P>
<P>No, really! interrutped <HI>Arabella,</HI> inno∣cently.</P>
<P>No, really, Madam, retorted Miss <HI>Glanville;</HI>
and I am surprised you should think so.</P>
<P>Indeed, my Dear, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> you are
very happy in this respect, and also very singu∣lar;
for I believe there are few young Ladies in
the World, who have any Pretensions to Beau∣ty,
that have not given Rise to a great many
Adventures; and some of them haply very fa∣tal.</P>
<P>If you knew more of the World, Lady <HI>Bella,</HI>
said Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> pertly, you would not be so
apt to think, that young Ladies engage them∣selves
in troublesome Adventures: Truly the
Ladies that are brought up in Town are not so
ready to run away with every Man they see.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="148"/>
No, certainly, interrupted <HI>Arabella;</HI> they do
not give their Consent to such Proceedings; but
for all that, they are, doubtless, run away with
many times; for truly there are some Men,
whose Passions are so unbridled, that they will
have recourse to the most violent Methods to
possess themselves of the Objects they love.
Pray do you remember how often <HI>Mandana</HI> was
run away with?</P>
<P>Not I indeed, Madam, replied Miss <HI>Glan∣ville;</HI>
I know nothing about her; but I suppose
she is a <HI>Jew,</HI> by her outlandish Name.</P>
<P>She was no <HI>Jew,</HI> said <HI>Arabella,</HI> tho' she fa∣voured
that People very much; for she obtained
the Liberty of great Numbers of them from <HI>Cy∣rus,</HI>
who had taken them Captives, and could
deny her nothing she asked.</P>
<P>Well, said Miss <HI>Glanville;</HI> and I suppose she
denied <HI>him</HI> nothing he asked; and so they were
even.</P>
<P>Indeed but she did tho', resumed <HI>Arabella;</HI>
for she refused to give him a glorious Scarf
which she wore, tho' he begged it on his Knees.</P>
<P>And she was very much in the right, said
Miss <HI>Glanville;</HI> for I see no Reason why a Lo∣ver
should expect a Gift of any Value from his
Mistress.</P>
<P>Doubtless, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> such a Gift was
worth a Million of Services; and, had he ob∣tained
it, it would have been a glorious Di∣stinction
for him: However, <HI>Mandana</HI> refused it;
and, severely virtuous as you are, I am persuaded
you can't help thinking, she was a little too ri∣gorous
in denying a Favour to a Lover like
him—</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="149"/>
Severely virtuous, Lady <HI>Bella!</HI> said Miss
<HI>Glanville,</HI> colouring with Anger: Pray what
do you mean by that? Have you any Reason
to imagine, I would grant any Favour to a
Lover?</P>
<P>Why, if I did, Cousin, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> would
it derogate so much from your Glory, think you,
to bestow a Favour upon a Lover worthy your
Esteem, and from whom you had received a
thousand Marks of a most pure and faithful Pas∣sion,
and also a great Number of very singular
Services?</P>
<P>I hope, Madam, said Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> it will
never be my Fate to be so much obliged to any
Lover, as to be under a Necessity of granting
him Favours in Requital.</P>
<P>I vow, Cousin, interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> you
put me in mind of the fair and virtuous <HI>Antonia,</HI>
who was so rigid and austere, that she thought
all Expressions of Love were criminal; and was
so far from granting any Person Permission to
love her, that she thought it a mortal Offence
to be adored even in private.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> who could not imagine <HI>Ara∣bella</HI>
spoke this seriously, but that it was de∣signed
to sneer at her great Eagerness to make
Conquests, and the Liberties she allowed herself
in, which had probably come to her Knowlege,
was so extremely vexed at the malicious Jest, as
she thought it, that, not being able to revenge
herself, she burst into Tears.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI>'s Good-nature made her be greatly
affected at this Sight; and, asking her Pardon
for having undesignedly occasioned her so much
Uneasiness, begged her to be composed, and
<PB N="134" REF="150"/>
tell her in what she had offended her, that she
might be able to justify herself in her Appre∣hensions.</P>
<P>You have made no Scruple to own, Madam,
said she, that you think me capable of granting
Favours to Lovers, when, Heaven knows, I ne∣ver
granted a Kiss without a great deal of Con∣fusion.</P>
<P>And you had certainly much Reason for Con∣fusion,
said <HI>Arabella,</HI> excessively surprised at such
a Confession: I assure you I never injured you
so much in my Thoughts, as to suppose you
ever granted a Favour of so criminal a Nature.</P>
<P>Look you there now! said Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI>
weeping more violently than before: I knew
what all your round-about Speeches would come
to: All you have said in Vindication of grant∣ing
Favours, was only to draw me into a Con∣fession
of what I have done: How ungenerous
was that!</P>
<P>The Favours I spoke of, Madam, said <HI>Ara∣bella,</HI>
were quite of another Nature, than those
it seems you have so liberally granted: Such as
giving a Scarf, a Bracelet, or some such Thing,
to a Lover, who had haply sighed whole Years
in Silence, and did not presume to declare his
Passion, till he had lost best Part of his Blood in
Defence of the Fair one he loved: It was when
you maintained, that <HI>Mandana</HI> was in the right
to refuse her magnificent Scarf to the illustrious
<HI>Cyrus,</HI> that I took upon me to oppose your Ri∣gidness;
and so much mistaken was I in your
Temper, that I foolishly compared you to the
fair and wise <HI>Antonia,</HI> whose Severity was so
remarkable; but really, by what I understand
<PB N="135" REF="151"/>
from your own Confession, your Disposition re∣sembles
that of the inconsiderate <HI>Julia,</HI> who
would receive a Declaration of Love without
Anger from any one; and was not over-shy,
any more than yourself, of granting Favours al∣most
as considerable as that you have men∣tioned.</P>
<P>While <HI>Arabella</HI> was speaking, Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI>
having dried up her Tears, sat silently swell∣ing
with Rage, not knowing whether she should
openly avow her Resentment for the injurious
Language her Cousin had used to her, by go∣ing
away immediately, or, by making up the
Matter, appear still to be her Friend, that she
might have the more Opportunities of revenge∣ing
herself. The Impetuosity of her Temper
made her most inclined to the former; but the
Knowlege that Sir <HI>George</HI> was to stay yet some
Months in the Country, made her unwilling to
leave a Place, where she might often see a Man
whose fine Person had made some Impression
upon her Heart; and, not enduring to leave such
a charming Conquest to <HI>Arabella,</HI> she resolved
to suppress her Resentment for the present; and
listened, without any Appearance of Discom∣posure,
to a fine Harangue of her Cousin upon
the Necessity of Reserve, and distant Behaviour,
to Men who presumed to declare themselves
Lovers, enforcing her Precepts with Examples
drawn from all the Romances she had ever read;
at the End of which she embraced her, and
assured her, if she had said any thing harsh, it
proceeded from her great Regard to her Glory,
of which she ardently wished to see her as fond
as herself.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="152"/>
Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> constrained herself to make a
Reply that might not appear disagreeable: And
they were upon these Terms, when Mr. <HI>Glan∣ville</HI>
came up to them, and told Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> Sir
<HI>George</HI> had sent to intreat their Company at his
House that Day: But, added he, as I presume
you will not think proper to go, on account of
your Mourning, neither my Sister nor I will ac∣cept
the Invitation.</P>
<P>I dare say, interrupted Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> hastily,
Lady <HI>Bella</HI> will not expect such a needless Piece
of Ceremony from us; and, if she don't think
proper to go, she won't confine <HI>us.</HI></P>
<P>By no means, Cousin, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> smiling;
and, being persuaded Sir <HI>George</HI> makes the En∣tertainment
purely for your Sake, it would not
be kind in me to deprive him of your Com∣pany.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> being pleased to find his Cou∣sin
discovered no Inclination to go, would have
persuaded his Sister not to leave Lady <HI>Bella:</HI>
But Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> looked so much displeased at
his Request, that he was obliged to insist upon
it no more; and, both retiring to dress, Lady
<HI>Bella</HI> went up to her Apartment, and betook
herself to her Books, which supplied the Place
of all Company to her.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> having taken more than or∣dinary
Pains in dressing herself, in order to ap∣pear
charming in the Eyes of Sir <HI>George,</HI> came
in to pay her Compliments to Lady <HI>Bella</HI> before
she went, not doubting but she would be cha∣grined
to see her look so well: But Lady <HI>Bella,</HI>
on the contrary, praised the Clearness of her
Complexion, and the Sparkling of her Eyes.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="153"/>
I question not, said she, but you will give
Fetters to more Persons than one To-day; but
remember, I charge you, added she smiling,
while you are taking away the Liberty of others,
to have a special Care of your own.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> who could not think it pos∣sible,
one Woman could praise another with
any Sincerity, cast a Glance at the Glass, fear∣ing
it was rather because she looked but indif∣ferently,
that her Cousin was so lavish in her
Praises; and, while she was setting her Fea∣tures
in a Mirror which every Day represented
a Face infinitely more lovely than her own, Mr.
<HI>Glanville</HI> came in, who, after having very re∣spectfully
taken Leave of Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> led his
Sister to the Coach.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George,</HI> who was extremely mortified to
find Lady <HI>Bella</HI> not in it, handed Miss <HI>Glan∣ville</HI>
out with an Air so reserved, that she rail∣lied
him upon it; and gave her Brother a very
unpleasing Emotion, by telling Sir <HI>George,</HI> she
hoped Lady <HI>Bella</HI>'s not coming along with them,
would not make him bad Company.</P>
<P>As he was too gallant to suffer an handsome
young Lady, who spread all her Attractions for
him, to believe he regretted the Absence of an∣other
when she was present; he coquetted with
her so much, that Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> was in hopes
his Sister would wholly engage him from Lady
<HI>Bella.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which our Heroine is engaged in a very
perilous Adventure.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the mean time, that solitary Fair one was
alarmed by a Fear of a very unaccountable
Nature; for, being in the Evening in her Closet,
the Windows of which had a Prospect of the
Gardens, she saw her illustrious concealed Lo∣ver,
who went by the Name of <HI>Edward,</HI> while
he was in her Father's Service, talking with
great Emotion to her House-Steward, who
seemed earnestly to listen to some Propositions
he was making to him. Her Surprize at this
Sight was so great, that she had not Power to
observe them any longer; but, seating herself in
her Chair, she had just Spirits enough to call
<HI>Lucy</HI> to her Assistance; who, extremely frighted
at the pale Looks of her Lady, gave her a
Smelling-bottle, and was preparing to cut her
Lace, when <HI>Arabella,</HI> preventing her, told her
in a low Voice, that she feared she should be
betrayed into the Hands of an insolent Lover,
who was come to steal her away. Yes, added
she with great Emotion, I have seen this pre∣sumptuous
Man holding a Conversation with
one of my Servants; and tho' I could not pos∣sibly,
at this Distance, hear their Discourse,
yet the Gestures they used in speaking, explained
it too well to me; and I have Reason to ex∣pect,
I shall suffer the same Violence that many
illustrious Ladies have done before me; and be
<PB N="139" REF="155"/>
carried away by Force from my own House, as
they were.</P>
<P>Alas! Madam! said <HI>Lucy,</HI> terrified at this
Discourse, who is it that intends to carry your
Ladyship away? Sure no Robbers will attempt
any Mischief at such a time as this!</P>
<P>Yes, <HI>Lucy,</HI> replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> with great Gra∣vity,
the worst kind of Robbers; Robbers who
do not prey upon Gold and Jewels; but,
what is infinitely more precious, Liberty and
Honour. Do you know that Person who called
himself <HI>Edward,</HI> and worked in these Gardens
like a common Gardener, is now in the House,
corrupting my Servants; and, questionless, pre∣paring
to force open my Chamber, and carry
me away? And Heaven knows when I shall be
delivered from his Chains.</P>
<P>God forbid, said <HI>Lucy,</HI> sobbing, that ever
such a Lady should have such hard Hap! What
Crime, I wonder, can you be guilty of, to de∣serve
to be in Chains?</P>
<P>My Crime, resumed <HI>Arabella,</HI> is to have At∣tractions
which expose me to these inevitable
Misfortunes, which even the greatest Princesses
have not escaped.—But, dear <HI>Lucy,</HI> can you
not think of some Methods by which I may
avoid the Evil which waits me? Who knows
but that he may, within these few Moments,
force a Passage into my Apartment? These
slight Locks can make but a poor Resistance to
the Violence he will be capable of using.</P>
<P>Oh dear Madam! cried <HI>Lucy,</HI> trembling,
and pressing near her, what shall we do?</P>
<P>I asked your Advice, said she; but I perceive
you are less able than myself to think of any
<PB N="140" REF="156"/>
thing to save me.—Ah! <HI>Glanville,</HI> pursued she,
sighing, would to Heaven thou wert here now!</P>
<P>Yes, Madam, said <HI>Lucy,</HI> Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI>
I am sure, would not suffer any one to hurt
your Ladyship.</P>
<P>As thou valuest my Friendship, said <HI>Arabella,</HI>
with great Earnestness, never acquaint him
with what has just now escaped my Lips: True,
I did call upon him in this Perplexity; I did
pronounce his Name; and that, haply, with a
Sigh, which involuntarily sorced its Way: And,
questionless, if he knew his good Fortune, even
amidst the Danger of losing me for ever, he
would resent some Emotions of Joy: But I
should die with Shame at having so indiscreetly
contributed to his Satisfaction: And, therefore,
again I charge you, conceal, with the utmost
Care, what I have said.</P>
<P>Indeed, Madam, said <HI>Lucy,</HI> I shall tell him
nothing but what your Ladyship bids me; and
I am so frighted, that I can think of nothing
but that terrible Man, that wants to carry you
away. Mercy on us! added she, starting, I
think I hear somebody on the Stairs!</P>
<P>Do not be alarmed, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> in a ma∣jestic
Tone: It is I who have most Reason to
fear: Nevertheless, I hope the Grandeur of my
Courage will not sink under this Accident.
Hark, somebody knocks at the Door of my
Antechamber:—My own Virtue shall support
me:—Go, <HI>Lucy,</HI> and ask who it is.</P>
<P>Indeed I can't, Madam, said she, clinging
to her: Pray pardon me: Indeed I am so afraid,
I cannot stir.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="157"/>
Weak-souled Wench! said <HI>Arabella,</HI> How
unfit art thou for Accidents like these! Ah!
had <HI>Cylenia</HI> and <HI>Nartesia</HI> been like thee, the
fair <HI>Berenice,</HI> and the Divine Princess of <HI>Media,</HI>
had not so eagerly intreated their Ravishers to
afford them their Company in their Captivity:
But go, I order you, and ask who it is that
is at the Door of my Apartment: They
knock again: Offer at no Excuses; but do your
Duty.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy,</HI> seeing her Lady was really angry, went
trembling out of the Closet; but would go no
farther than her Bedchamber, from whence she
called out to know who was at the Door.</P>
<P>I have some Business with your Lady, said
the House-Steward (for it was he that knocked):
Can I speak with her at present?</P>
<P><HI>Lucy,</HI> a little reassured by his Voice, made
no Answer; but, creeping softly to the Door of
the Antechamber, double-locked it; and then
cried out in a Transport, No, I will take Care
you shall not come to my Lady.</P>
<P>And why, pray, Mrs. <HI>Lucy?</HI> said the Steward:
What have I done, that you are so much my
Enemy?</P>
<P>You are a Rogue, said <HI>Lucy,</HI> growing very
courageous, because the Door was locked be∣tween
them.</P>
<P>A Rogue! said he, What Reason have you
for calling me a Rogue? I assure you I will ac∣quaint
my Lady with your Insolence. I came
to speak to her Ladyship about <HI>Edward;</HI> who
prayed me to intercede for him, that he may
be taken again into her Service: For he says,
my Lady never believed any thing against him;
<PB N="142" REF="158"/>
and that was my Business: But, when I see
her, I'll know whether you are allowed to abuse
me in this manner.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> by this time, was advanced as
far as the Bedchamber, longing to know what
sort of Conference <HI>Lucy</HI> was holding with her
intended Ravisher: When that faithful Confi∣dante,
seeing her, came running to her, and
whispered her, that the House-Steward was at
the Door, and said he wanted to intercede for
<HI>Edward.</HI></P>
<P>Ah! the Traitor! said <HI>Arabella,</HI> retiring
again: Has he, then, really bargained with that
disloyal Man, to deliver up his Mistress? I am
undone, <HI>Lucy,</HI> said she, unless I can find a
Way to escape out of the House. They will,
questionless, soon force the Doors of my Apart∣ment.</P>
<P>Suppose, said <HI>Lucy,</HI> your Ladyship went
down the Stairs that lead from your Dressing∣room
into the Garden; and you may hide your∣self
in the Gardener's House till Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>
come.</P>
<P>I approve, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> of one Part of your
Proposal: But I shall not trust myself in the
Gardener's House; who, questionless, is in the
Plot with the rest of my perfidious Servants,
since none of them have endeavoured to adver∣tise
me of my Danger. If we can gain the
Gardens undiscovered, we may get out by that
Door at the Foot of the Terrace, which leads
into the Fields; for you know I always keep
the Key of that private Door: So, <HI>Lucy,</HI> let us
commend ourselves to the Direction of Provi∣dence,
and be gone immediately.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="159"/>
But what shall we do, Madam, said <HI>Lucy,</HI>
when we are got out?</P>
<P>Why, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> you shall conduct me
to your Brother's; and, probably, we may meet
with some generous Cavalier by the Way, who
will protect us till we get thither: However, as
I have as great a Danger to fear within Doors,
as without, I will venture to make my Escape,
though I should not be so fortunate as to meet
with any Knight who will undertake to pro∣tect
me from the Danger which I may appre∣hend
in the Fields.</P>
<P>Saying this, she gave the Key of the Door to
<HI>Lucy,</HI> whose Heart beat violently with Fear;
and, covering herself with some black Cypress,
which she wore in the Nature of a Veil, went
softly down the little Staircase to the Terrace,
followed by <HI>Lucy</HI> (who looked eagerly about her
every Step that she went); and, having gained
the Garden-door, hastily unlocked it, and fled,
as fast as possible, cross the Fields, in order to
procure a Sanctuary at <HI>William</HI>'s House: <HI>Ara∣bella,</HI>
begging Heaven to throw some generous
Cavalier in her Way, whose Protection she
might implore, and, taking every Tree at a
Distance for a Horse and Knight, hastened her
Steps to meet her approaching Succour; which,
as soon as she came near, miserably balked her
Expectations.</P>
<P>Though <HI>William</HI>'s Farm was not more than
two Miles from the Castle; yet <HI>Arabella,</HI> un∣used
to such a rude Way of Travelling, began
to be greatly fatigued: The Fear she was in of
being pursued by her apprehended Ravisher, had
so violent an Effect upon her Spirits, that she
<PB N="144" REF="160"/>
was hardly able to prosecute her Flight; and, to
complete her Misfortunes, happening to stumble
over a Stump of a Tree that lay in her Way,
she strained her Ancle; and the violent Anguish
she felt, threw her into a Swoon.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy,</HI> upon whose Arm she leaned, perceiv∣ing
her fainting, screamed out aloud, not know∣ing
what to do with her in that Condition: She
placed her upon the Ground; and, supporting
her Head against that fatal Stump, began to rub
her Temples, weeping excessively all the time.
Her Swoon still continuing, the poor Girl was
in inconceivable Terror: Her Brother's House
was now but a little Way off; but it being im∣possible
for her to carry her Lady thither with∣out
some Help, she knew not what to resolve
upon.</P>
<P>At length, thinking it better to leave her for
a few Moments, to run for Assistance, than to
sit by her and see her perish for want of it, she
left her, though not without extreme Agony;
and flew, with the utmost Eagerness, to her
Brother's. She was lucky enough to meet
him just coming out of his Door; and, telling
him the Condition in which she left her Lady,
he, without asking any Questions about the
Occasion of so strange an Accident, notwith∣standing
his Amazement, ran with all Speed to
the Place where <HI>Lucy</HI> had left her: But, to their
Astonishment and Sorrow, she was not to be
found: They walked a long time in Search of
her; and <HI>Lucy,</HI> being almost distracted with
Fear lest she had been carried away, made
Complaints that so puzzled her Brother he
knew not what to say to her: But, finding their
<PB N="145" REF="161"/>
Search fruitless, they agreed to go home to the
Castle, supposing, with some Appearance of
Reason, that they might hear of her there.</P>
<P>Here they found nothing but Grief and Con∣fusion.
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> and his Sister were just
returned, and had been at Lady <HI>Bella</HI>'s Apart∣ment;
but, not finding her there, they asked
her Women where she was, who, not know∣ing
any thing of her Flight, concluded she was
in the Garden with <HI>Lucy.</HI> Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> sur∣prised
at her being at that Hour in the Garden,
ran eagerly to engage her to come in, being ap∣prehensive
she would take Cold, by staying so
late in the Air: But, not finding her in any of
her usual Walks, he ordered several of the
Servants to assist him in searching the whole
Garden, sending them to different Places: But
they all returned without Success; which filled
him with the utmost Consternation.</P>
<P>He was returning, excessively uneasy, to the
House, when he saw <HI>Lucy;</HI> who had been just
told, in answer to her Inquiries about her Lady,
that they were gone to look for her in the
Garden; and running up to Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI>
who hoped to hear News of Lady <HI>Bella</HI> from
her, Oh! Sir, said she, is my Lady found?</P>
<P>What! <HI>Lucy,</HI> said Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> (more
alarmed than before), do not you know where
she is? I thought you had been with her.</P>
<P>Oh! dear, cried <HI>Lucy,</HI> wringing her Hands;
for certain my poor Lady was stolen away while
she was in that fainting Fit. Sir, said she to
<HI>Glanville,</HI> I know who the Person is that my
Lady said (and almost broke my Heart) would
<PB N="146" REF="162"/>
keep her in Chains: He was in the House not
many Hours ago.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> suspecting this was some new
Whim of <HI>Arabella</HI>'s, would not suffer <HI>Lucy</HI> to
say any more before the Servants, who stood
gaping with Astonishment at the strange Things
she uttered; but bid her follow him to his
Apartment, and he would hear what she could
inform him concerning this Accident. He
would, if possible, have prevented his Sister
from being present at the Story; but, not being
able to form any Excuse for not suffering her to
hear every thing that related to her Cousin, they
all three went into his Chamber; where he de∣sired
<HI>Lucy</HI> to tell him what she knew about her
Lady.</P>
<P>You must know, Sir, said <HI>Lucy,</HI> sobbing,
that there came a Man here to take away my
Lady: A great Man he is, though he worked
in the Gardens; for he was in Love with her:
And so he would not own who he was.</P>
<P>And pray, interrupted Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> Who
told you he was a great Man, as you say?</P>
<P>My Lady told me, said <HI>Lucy:</HI> But, <HI>how∣somever,</HI>
he was turned away; for the Gar∣dener
says he catched him stealing Carp.</P>
<P>A very great Man, indeed, said Miss <HI>Glan∣ville,</HI>
that would steal Carp!</P>
<P>You must know, Madam, said she, that was
only a Pretence: For he went there, my Lady
says, to drown himself.</P>
<P>Bless me! cried Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> laughing;
the Girl's distracted, sure. Lord! Brother,
don't listen to her nonsensical Tales; we shall
never find my Cousin by her.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="163"/>
Leave her to me, said Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> whis∣pering:
Perhaps I may discover something by her
Discourse, that will give us some Light into this
Affair.</P>
<P>Nay, I'll stay, I am resolved, answered she;
for I long to know where my Cousin is: Tho',
do you think what this Girl says is true, about
a great Man disguised in the Gardens? Sure my
Cousin could never tell her such Stuff: But,
now I think of it, added she, Lady <HI>Bella,</HI>
when we were speaking about the Jockey,
talked something about a Lover: I now believe
it is as the Girl says. Pray let's hear her out.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> was ready to die with Vexation,
at the Charmer of his Soul's being thus exposed;
but there was no Help for it.</P>
<P>Pray, said he to <HI>Lucy,</HI> tell us no more about
this Man: But, if you can guess where your
Lady is, let me know.</P>
<P>Indeed I can't, Sir, said she; for my Lady and
I both stole out of the House, for fear <HI>Edward</HI>
should break open the Doors of her Apartment;
and we were running as fast as possible to my
Brother's House (where she said she would hide
herself till you came); but my poor dear Lady
fell down and hurt herself so much, that she
fainted away: I tried what I could to fetch her
again; but she did not open her Eyes: So I ran
like Lightning to my Brother, to come and help
me to carry her to the Farm; but, when we
came back, she was gone.</P>
<P>What do you say? cried Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> with
a distracted Look: Did you leave her in that
Condition in the Fields? And was she not to
be found when you came back?</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="164"/>
No, indeed, Sir, said <HI>Lucy,</HI> weeping, we
could not find her, though we wandered about
a long time.</P>
<P>Oh! Heavens! said he, walking about the
Room in a violent Emotion, Where can she be?
What is become of her? Dear Sister, pursued
he, order somebody to saddle my Horse: I'll
traverse the Country all Night in quest of her.</P>
<P>You had best inquire, Sir, said <HI>Lucy,</HI> if
<HI>Edward</HI> is in the House: He knows, may be,
where my Lady is.</P>
<P>Who is he? cried <HI>Glanville.</HI></P>
<P>Why the great Man, Sir, said <HI>Lucy,</HI> whom
we thought to be a Gardener, who came to
carry my Lady away; which made her get out
of the House as fast as she could.</P>
<P>This is the strangest Story, said Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI>
that ever I heard: Sure nobody would be so
mad to attempt such an Action; my Cousin has
the oddest Whims!</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> not able to listen any longer,
charged <HI>Lucy</HI> to say nothing of this Matter to
any one; and then ran eagerly out of the Room,
ordering two or three of the Servants to go in
Search of their Lady: He then mounted his
Horse in great Anguish of Mind, not knowing
whither to direct his Course.</P>

in a very melancholy Situation: <HI>Lucy</HI>
had not been gone long from her before she
opened her Eyes; and, beginning to come per∣fectly
to herself, was surprised to find her
Woman not near her: The Moon shining very
bright, she looked round her, and called <HI>Lucy</HI>
as loud as she was able; but not seeing her, or
hearing any Answer, her Fears became so power∣ful,
that she had like to have relapsed into her
Swoon.</P>
<P>Alas! unfortunate Maid that I am! cried she,
weeping excessively, questionless I am betrayed
by her on whose Fidelity I relied, and who was
acquainted with my most secret Thoughts: She
is now with my Ravisher, directing his Pursuit,
and I have no Means of escaping from his
Hands! Cruel and ungrateful Wench, thy un∣paralleled
Treachery grieves me no less than all
my other Misfortunes: But why do I say, Her
Treachery is unparalleled? Did not the wicked
<HI>Arianta</HI> betray her Mistress into the Power of
her insolent Lover? Ah! <HI>Arabella,</HI> thou art
not single in thy Misery, since the divine <HI>Man∣dana</HI>
was, like thyself, the Dupe of a merce∣nary
Servant.</P>
<P>Having given a Moment or two to these sad
Reflections, she rose from the Ground with an
<PB N="150" REF="166"/>
Intention to walk on▪ but her Ancle was so pain∣ful,
that she could hardly move: Her Tears began
now to flow with greater Violence: She ex∣pected
every Moment to see <HI>Edward</HI> approach
her; and was resigning herself up to Despair,
when a Chaise, driven by a young Gentleman,
passed by her. <HI>Arabella,</HI> thanking Heaven for
sending this Relief, called out a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> loud as she
could, conjuring him to stay.</P>
<P>The Gentleman, hearing a Woman's Voice,
stopped immediately, and asked what she
wanted.</P>
<P>Generous Stranger, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> advancing as
well as was she able, do not refuse your Assistance
to save me from a most terrible Danger: I am
pursued by a Person whom, for very urgent
Reasons, I desire to avoid. I conjure you,
therefore, in the Name of her you love best, to
protect me; and may you be crowned with the
Enjoyment of all your Wishes, for so charitable
an Action!</P>
<P>If the Gentleman was surprised at this Address,
he was much more astonished at the Beauty of
her who made it: Her Stature; her Shape, her
inimitable Complexion; the Lustre of her fine
Eyes, and the thousand Charms that adorned
her whole Person, kept him a Minute silently
gazing upon her, without having the Power to
make her an Answer.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> finding he did not speak, was ex∣tremely
disappointed. Ah! Sir, said she,
What do you deliberate upon? Is it possible
you can deny so reasonable a Request, to a
Lady in my Circumstances?</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="167"/>
For God's sake, Madam, said the Gentle∣man,
alighting, and approaching her, let me
know who you are, and how I can be of any
Service to you.</P>
<P>As for my Quality, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> be assured
it is not mean; and let this Knowlege suffice at
present: The Service I desire of you is, to con∣vey
me to some Place where I may be in Safety
for this Night: To-morrow I will intreat you
to let some Persons, whom I shall name to you,
know where I am; to the end they may take
proper Measures to secure me from the Attempts
of an insolent Man, who has driven me from
my own House, by the Designs he was going
to execute.</P>
<P>The Gentleman saw there was some Mystery
in her Case, which she did not choose to ex∣plain;
and, being extremely glad at having so
beautiful a Creature in his Power, told her she
might command him in all she pleased; and,
helping her into the Chaise, drove off as fast as
he could; <HI>Arabella</HI> suffering no Apprehensions
from being alone with a Stranger, since nothing
was more common to Heroines than such Ad∣ventures;
all her Fears being of <HI>Edward,</HI> whom
she fansied every Moment she saw pursuing
them: And, being extremely anxious to be in
some Place of Safety, she urged her Protector to
drive as fast as possible; who, willing to have her
at his own House, complied with her Request;
but was so unlucky in his Haste, as to overturn
the Chaise. Though neither <HI>Arabella</HI> nor him∣self
were hurt by the Fall, yet the Necessity
there was to stay some time to put the Chaise
in a Condition to carry them any farther, filled
<PB N="152" REF="168"/>
her with a thousand Apprehensions, lest they
should be overtaken.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Servants of <HI>Arabella,</HI>
among whom <HI>Edward,</HI> not knowing how much
he was concerned in her Flight, was resolved
to distinguish himself by his Zeal in searching
for her, had dispersed themselves about in dif∣ferent
Places: Chance conducted <HI>Edward</HI> to
the very Spot where she was: When <HI>Arabella,</HI>
perceiving him while he was two or three
Paces off, Oh! Sir, cried she, behold my
Persecutor! Can you resolve to defend me
against the Violence he comes to offer me?</P>
<P>The Gentleman, looking up, and seeing a
Man in Livery approaching them, asked her, If
that was the Person she complained of; and
if he was her Servant?</P>
<P>If he is my Servant, Sir, replied she, blush∣ing,
he never had my Permission to be so: And,
indeed, no one else can boast of my having
granted them such a Liberty.</P>
<P>Do you know whose Servant he is, then,
Madam? replied the Gentleman, a little sur∣prised
at her Answer; which he could not well
understand.</P>
<P>You throw me into a great Embarrassment,
Sir, resumed <HI>Arabella,</HI> blushing more than be∣fore:
Questionless, he appears to be mine;
but, since, as I told you before, he never dis∣covered
himself to me, and I never permitted
him to assume that Title, his Services, if ever I
received any from him, were not at all considered
by me, as Things for which I was obliged to
him.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="169"/>
The Gentleman, still more amazed at An∣swers
so little to the Purpose, was going to de∣sire
her to explain herself upon this strange Af∣fair;
when <HI>Edward,</HI> coming up close to <HI>Ara∣bella,</HI>
cried out in a Transport, Oh! Madam!
thank God you are found.</P>
<P>Hold, impious Man! said <HI>Arabella,</HI> and do
not give Thanks for that which, haply, may
prove thy Punishment. If I am found, thou
wilt be no better for it: And, if thou continuest
to persecute me, thou wilt probably meet with
thy Death, where thou thinkest thou hast found
thy Happiness.</P>
<P>The poor Fellow, who understood not a
Word of this Discourse, stared upon her like
one that had lost his Wits; when the Protector
of <HI>Arabella,</HI> approaching him, asked him, with
a stern Look, What he had to say to that
Lady, and why he presumed to follow her?</P>
<P>As the Man was going to answer him, Mr.
<HI>Glanville</HI> came galloping up; and <HI>Edward,</HI> see∣ing
him, ran up to him, and informed him,
that he had met with Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> and a Gentle∣man,
who seemed to have been overturned in a
Chaise, which he was endeavouring to refit;
and that her Ladyship was offended with him
for coming up to her; and also, that the Gen∣tleman
had used some threatening Language to
him upon that Account.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> excessively surprised at what
he heard, stopped; and, ordering a Servant who
came along with him, to run back to the
Castle, and bring a Chaise thither to carry Lady
<HI>Bella</HI> home, he asked <HI>Edward</HI> several more
Questions relating to what she and the Gentle∣man
<PB N="154" REF="170"/>
had said to him: And, notwithstanding
his Knowlege of her ridiculous Humour, he
could not help being alarmed by her Behaviour,
nor concluding that there was something very
mysterious in the Affair.</P>
<P>While he was thus conversing with <HI>Edward,
Arabella,</HI> who had spied him almost as soon,
was filled with Apprehension to see him hold so
quiet a Parly with her Ravisher: The more she
reflected upon this Accident, the more her Su∣spicions
increased; and, persuading herself at
last, that Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> was privy to his
Designs, this Belief, however improbable,
wrought so powerfully upon her Imagination,
that she could not restrain her Tears.</P>
<P>Doubtless, said she, I am betrayed, and the
perjured <HI>Glanville</HI> is no longer either my Friend
or Lover: He is this Moment concerting Mea∣sures
with my Ravisher, how to deliver me into
his Power; and, like <HI>Philidaspes,</HI> is glad of an
Opportunity, by this Treachery, to be rid of a
Woman whom his Parents and hers had destined
for his Wife.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> having learned all he could
from <HI>Edward,</HI> alighted; and, giving him his
Horse to hold, came up to <HI>Arabella:</HI> And, after
expressing his Joy at meeting with her, begged
her to let him know what Accident had brought
her, unattended, from the Castle, at that time
of Night.</P>
<P>If by this Question, said the incensed <HI>Ara∣bella,</HI>
you would persuade me you are ignorant
of the Cause of my Flight, know, your Dissimu∣lation
will not succeed; and that, having Reason
to believe you are equally guilty with him from
<PB N="155" REF="171"/>
whose intended Violence I fled, I shall have re∣course
to the Valour of this Knight you see with
me, to defend me, as well against you, as that
Ravisher, with whom I see you leagued.—Ah!
unworthy Cousin, pursued she, What dost thou
propose to thyself by so black a Treachery?
What is to be the Price of my Liberty, which
thou so freely disposest of? Has thy Friend
there, said she (pointing to <HI>Edward</HI>), a Sister,
or any Relation, for whom thou barterest, by
delivering me up to him? But, assure thyself,
this Stratagem shall be of no Use to thee: For,
if thou art base enough to oppress my valiant
Deliverer with Numbers, and thinkest, by Vio∣lence,
to get me into thy Power, my Cries
shall arm Heaven and Earth in my Defence.
Providence may, haply, send some generous
Cavaliers to my Rescue; and, if Providence fails
me, my own Hand shall give me Freedom; for
that Moment thou offerest to seize me, that
Moment shall be the last of my Life.</P>
<P>While <HI>Arabella</HI> was speaking, the young Gentle∣man
and <HI>Edward,</HI> who listened to her, eagerly,
thought her Brain was disturbed: But Mr.
<HI>Glanville</HI> was in a terrible Consusion, and si∣lently
cursed his ill Fate, to make him in
Love with a Woman so ridiculous.</P>
<P>For Heaven's sake, Cousin, said he, striving
to repress some Part of his Disorder, Do not
give way to these extravagant Notions: There is
nobody intends to do you any Wrong.</P>
<P>What! interrupted she, would you persuade
me, that that Impostor there, pointing to <HI>Ed∣ward,</HI>
has not a Design to carry me away;
<PB N="156" REF="172"/>
which you, by supporting him, are not equally
guilty of?</P>
<P>Who? I! Madam! cried out <HI>Edward:</HI> Sure
your Ladyship does not suspect me of such a
strange Design! God knows I never thought of
such a Thing!</P>
<P>Ah! Dissembler! interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> do
not make use of that sacred Name to mask thy
impious Falshoods: Confess with what Intent
you came into my Father's Service disguised.</P>
<P>I never came disguised, Madam, returned
<HI>Edward.</HI></P>
<P>No! said <HI>Arabella:</HI> What means that Dress
in which I see you, then?</P>
<P>'Tis the Marquis's Livery, Madam, said
<HI>Edward,</HI> which he did not order to be taken
from me when I left his Service.</P>
<P>And with what Purpose didst thou wear it?
said she, Do not your Thoughts accuse you of
your Crime?</P>
<P>I always hoped, Madam—said he.</P>
<P>You hoped! interrupted <HI>Arabella:</HI> frowning,
Did I ever give you Reason to hope? I will not
deny but I had Compassion on you; but even
That you was ignorant of.</P>
<P>I know, Madam, you had Compassion on
me, said <HI>Edward;</HI> for your Ladyship, I always
thought, did not believe me guilty.</P>
<P>I was weak enough, said she, to have Com∣passion
on you, though I <HI>did</HI> believe you guilty.</P>
<P>Indeed, Madam, returned <HI>Edward,</HI> I al∣ways
hoped, as I said before (but your Ladyship
would not hear me out), that you did not be∣lieve
any malicious Reports; and therefore you
had Compassion on me.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="173"/>
I had no Reports of you, said she, but what
my own Observation gave me; and that was
sufficient to convince me of your Fault.</P>
<P>Why, Madam, said <HI>Edward,</HI> did your Lady∣ship
see me steal the Carp then, which was the
Fault unjustly laid to my Charge?</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> as much Cause as he had for
Uneasiness, could with great Difficulty restrain
Laughter at this ludicrous Circumstance; for he
guessed what Crime <HI>Arabella</HI> was accusing him
of: As for the young Gentleman, he could not
conceive what she meant, and longed to hear
what would be the End of such a strange Con∣ference.
But poor <HI>Arabella</HI> was prodigiously
confounded at his mentioning so low an Affair;
not being able to endure that <HI>Glanville</HI> and
her Protector should know a Lover of her's
could be suspected of so base a Theft.</P>
<P>The Shame she conceived at it, kept her
silent for a Moment: But, recovering herself at
last, No, said she, I knew you better than to
give any Credit to such an idle Report: Persons
of your Condition do not commit such paltry
Crimes.</P>
<P>Upon my Soul, Madam, said the young
Gentleman, Persons of his Condition often do
worse.</P>
<P>I don't deny it, Sir, said <HI>Arabella;</HI> and the
Design he meditated of carrying me away was
infinitely worse.</P>
<P>Really, Madam, returned the Gentleman,
if you are such a Person as I apprehend, I
don't see how he durst make such an At∣tempt.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="174"/>
It is very possible, Sir, said she, that I might
be carried away, though I was of greater Qua∣lity
than I am: Were not <HI>Mandana, Candace,
Clelia,</HI> and many other Ladies who underwent
the same Fate, of a Quality more illustrious
than mine?</P>
<P>Really, Madam, said he, I know none of
these Ladies.</P>
<P>No, Sir! said <HI>Arabella;</HI> extremely mortified.</P>
<P>Let me intreat you, Cousin, interrupted <HI>Glan∣ville</HI>
(who feared this Dispute would be very
tedious), to expose yourself no longer to the
Air at this time of Night: Suffer me to conduct
you home.</P>
<P>It concerns my Honour, said she, that this
generous Stranger should not think I am the
only one that was ever exposed to these insolent
Attempts. You say, Sir, pursued she, that
you don't know any of these Ladies I mention∣ed
before: Let me ask you, then, If you are
acquainted with <HI>Parthenissa,</HI> or <HI>Cleopatra?</HI> who
were both, for some Months, in the Hands of
their Ravishers.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Parthenissa,</HI> Madam, neither have I heard
of her; nor do I remember to have heard of
any more than one <HI>Cleopatra:</HI> But she was never
ravished, I am certain; for she was too willing.</P>
<P>How! Sir, said <HI>Arabella:</HI> Was <HI>Cleopatra</HI>
ever willing to run away with her Ravisher?</P>
<P><HI>Cleopatra</HI> was a Whore, was she not, Madam?
said he.</P>
<P>Hold thy Peace, unworthy Man, said <HI>Ara∣bella;</HI>
and profane not the Memory of that fair
and glorious Queen, by such injurious Lan∣guage:
That Queen, I say, whose Courage was
<PB N="159" REF="175"/>
equal to her Beauty; and her Virtue surpassed
by neither. Good Heavens! What a black
Defamer have I chosen for my Protector!</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> rejoicing to see <HI>Arabella</HI> in a
Disposition to be offended with her new Ac∣quaintance,
resolved to sooth her a little, in
hopes of prevailing upon her to return home.
Sir, said he to the Gentleman, who could not
conceive why the Lady should so warmly de∣fend
<HI>Cleopatra,</HI> you were in the Wrong to cast
such Reflections upon that great Queen (re∣peating
what he had heard his Cousin say be∣fore):
For all the World, pursued he, knows
she was married to <HI>Julius Caesar.</HI></P>
<P>Though I commend you, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> for
taking the Part of a Lady so basely vilified; yet
let not your Zeal for her Honour induce you
to say more than is true for its Justification;
for thereby you weaken, instead of strengthening,
what may be said in her Defence. One
Falshood always supposes another, and renders
all you can say suspected: Whereas pure, un∣mixed
Truth, carries Conviction along with it,
and never fails to produce its desired Effect.</P>
<P>Suffer me, Cousin, interrupted <HI>Glanville,</HI> to
represent to you, the Inconveniency you will
certainly feel, by staying so late in the Air:
Leave the Justification of <HI>Cleopatra</HI> to some
other Opportunity; and take care of your own
Preservation.</P>
<P>What is it you require of me? said <HI>Arabella.</HI></P>
<P>Only, resumed <HI>Glanville,</HI> that you would be
pleased to return to the Castle, where my Sister,
and all your Servants, are inconsolable for your
Absence.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="176"/>
But who can assure me, answered she, that
I shall not, by returning home, enter volunta∣rily
into my Prison? For, to say the Truth,
I still more than suspect you abet the Designs
of this Man; since I behold you in his Party,
and ready, no doubt, to draw your Sword in
his Defence: How will you be able to clear
yourself of this Crime? Yet I will venture to
return to my House, provided you will swear
to me, you will offer me no Violence, with
regard to your Friend there: And also I insist,
that he, from this Moment, disclaim all Inten∣tions
of persecuting me, and banish himself
from my Presence for ever. Upon this Con∣dition
I pardon him, and will likewise pray to
Heaven to pardon him also. Speak, presump∣tuous
Unknown, said she to <HI>Edward,</HI> Wilt
thou accept of my Pardon upon the Terms I
offer it thee? And wilt thou take thyself to some
Place where I may never behold thee again?</P>
<P>Since your Ladyship, said <HI>Edward,</HI> is resolved
not to receive me into your Service, I shan't
trouble you any more: But I think it hard to
be punished for a Crime I was not guilty of.</P>
<P>'Tis better, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> turning from him,
that thou shouldst complain of my Rigour, than
the World tax me with Lightness and Indiscre∣tion.
And now, Sir, said she to <HI>Glanville,</HI> I
must trust myself to your Honour, which I con∣fess
I do a little suspect: But, however, 'tis
possible you have repented, like the poor Prince
<HI>Thrasybulus,</HI> when he submitted to the Sug∣gestions
of a wicked Friend, to carry away the
fair <HI>Alcionida,</HI> whom he afterwards restored.
Speak, <HI>Glanville,</HI> pursued she, are you desirous
<PB N="161" REF="177"/>
of imitating that virtuous Prince, or do you
still retain your former Sentiments?</P>
<P>Upon my Word, Madam, said <HI>Glanville,</HI>
you will make me quite mad, if you go on in
this manner: Pray let me see you safe home;
and then, if you please, you may forbid my
Entrance into the Castle, if you suspect me of
any bad Intentions towards you.</P>
<P>'Tis enough, said she; I will trust you. As
for you, Sir, speaking to the young Gentleman,
you are so unworthy, in my Apprehensions, by
the Calumnies you have uttered against a Per∣son
of that Sex which merits all your Admira∣tion
and Reverence, that I hold you very unfit
to be a Protector of any of it: Therefore I
dispense with your Services upon this Occasion;
and think it better to trust myself to the Conduct
of a Person, who, like <HI>Thrasybulus,</HI> by his Re∣pentance,
has restored himself to my Confi∣dence,
than to one, who, though, indeed, he
has never betrayed me, yet seems very capable
of doing so, if he had the Power.</P>
<P>Saying this, she gave her Hand to <HI>Glanville,</HI>
who helped her into the Chaise that was come
from the Castle; and the Servant, who brought
it, mounting his Horse, Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> drove
her Home, leaving the Gentleman, who, by
this time, had refitted his Chaise, in the
greatest Astonishment imaginable at her un∣accountable
Behaviour.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Two Conversations, out of which the
Reader may pick up a great deal.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>RABELLA,</HI> continuing to rumi∣nate
upon her Adventure during
their little Journey, appeared so
low and reserved, that Mr. <HI>Glan∣ville,</HI>
tho' he ardently wished to
know all the Particulars of her Flight, and
Meeting with that Gentleman, whose Com∣pany
he found her in, was obliged to suppress
his Curiosity for the present, out of a Fear of
displeasing her. As soon as they alighted at the
<PB N="164" REF="179"/>
Castle, her Servants ran to receive her at the
Gates, expressing their Joy to see her again, by
a thousand confused Exclamations.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> being at her Toilet when she
heard of her Arrival, ran down to welcome her,
in her Hurry forgetting, that as her Woman had
been curling her Hair, she had no Cap on.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> received her Compliments with a
little Coolness; for, observing that her Grief
for her Absence had not made her neglect any
of her usual Solicitude about her Person, she
could not conceive it had been very great: There∣fore,
when she had made some slight Answer
to the hundred Questions she asked in a Breath,
she went up to her Apartment; and, calling
<HI>Lucy,</HI> who was crying with Joy for her Return,
she questioned her strictly concerning her
leaving her in the Fields, acknowleging to
her, that she suspected her Fidelity, tho' she
wished, at the same time, she might be able to
clear herself.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy,</HI> in her Justification, related, after her
punctual Way, all that had happened: By
which, <HI>Arabella</HI> was convinced she had not be∣trayed
her; and was also in some Doubt, whe∣ther
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> was guilty of any Design
against her.</P>
<P>Since, said she to <HI>Lucy,</HI> thou art restored to
my good Opinion, I will, as I have always
done, unmask my Thoughts to thee. I con∣fess
then, with Shame and Confusion, that I
cannot think of Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>'s assisting the Un∣known
to carry me away, without <HI>resenting</HI> a
most poignant Grief: Questionless, my Weak∣ness
will surprise thee; and could I conceal it
<PB N="165" REF="180"/>
from myself, I would from thee; but, alas! it is
certain, that I do not hate him; and I believe
I never shall, guilty as he may be in my Appre∣hensions.</P>
<P>Hate him! Madam, said <HI>Lucy:</HI> God forbid
you should ever hate Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who, I am
sure, loves your Ladyship as well as he does his
own Sister!</P>
<P>You are very confident, <HI>Lucy,</HI> said <HI>Arabella</HI>
blushing, to mention the Word Love to me:
If I thought my Cousin had bribed thee to it, I
should be greatly incensed: However, tho' I
forbid you to talk of his Passion, yet I permit
you to tell me the Violence of his Trans∣ports
when I was missing; the Threats he ut∣tered
against my Ravishers; the Complaints
he made against Fortune; the Vows he of∣fered
for my Preservation; and, in fine,
whatever Extravagances the Excess of his Sor∣row
forced him to commit.</P>
<P>I assure you, Madam, said <HI>Lucy,</HI> I did not
hear him say any of all this.</P>
<P>What! interrupted <HI>Arabella:</HI> And didst thou
not observe the Tears trickle from his Eyes,
which, haply, he strove to conceal? Did he
not strike his Bosom with the Vehemence of
his Grief; and cast his accusing and despairing
Eyes to Heaven, which had permitted such a
Misfortune to befal me?</P>
<P>Indeed, Madam, I did not, resumed <HI>Lucy;</HI>
but he seemed to be very sorry; and said, He
would go and look for your Ladyship.</P>
<P>Ah! the Traitor! interrupted <HI>Arabella</HI> in a
Rage: Fain would I have found out some Ex∣cuse
for him, and justified him in my Appre∣hensions;
<PB N="166" REF="181"/>
but he is unworthy of these savourable
Thoughts: Speak of him no more, I command
you; he is guilty of assiisting my Ravisher to
carry me away; and therefore merits my eter∣nal
Displeasure: But tho' I could find Reasons
to clear him even of that Crime, yet he is guilty
of Indifference and Insensibility for my Loss,
since he neither died with Grief at the News of
it; nor needed the Interposition of his Sister, or
the Desire of delivering me, to make him live.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> when she had said this, was silent;
but could not prevent some Tears stealing down
her fair Face: Therefore, to conceal her Un∣easiness,
or to be at more Liberty to indulge it,
she ordered <HI>Lucy</HI> to make haste and undress
her; and, going To-bed, passed the small Re∣mainder
of the Night, not in Rest, which she
very much needed, but, in Reflections on all
the Passages of the preceding Day: And, finding,
or imagining she found, new Reasons for con∣demning
Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> her Mind was very
far from being at Ease.</P>
<P>In the Morning, lying later than usual, she
received a Message from Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> in∣quiring
after her Health; to which she an∣swered,
That he was too little concerned in the
Preservation of it, to make it necessary to ac∣quaint
him.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> soon after sent to desire Per∣mission
to drink her Chocolate by her Bedside;
which as she could not in Civility refuse, she
was very much perplexed how to hide her Mel∣ancholy
from the Eyes of that discerning Lady,
who, she questioned not, would interpret it
in favour of her Brother.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="182"/>
Upon Miss <HI>Glanville</HI>'s Appearance, she forced
herself to assume a chearful Look, asking her
Pardon, for receiving her in Bed; and com∣plaining
of bad Rest, which had occasioned her
lying late.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> after answering her Compli∣ments
with almost equal Politeness, proceeded
to ask her an hundred Questions concerning
the Cause of her Absence from the Castle: Your
Woman, pursued she, laughing, told us a strange
Medley of Stuff about a great Man, who was a
Gardener; and wanted to carry you away:
Sure there was nothing in it! Was there?</P>
<P>You must excuse me, Cousin, said <HI>Arabella,</HI>
if I do not answer your Questions precisely now:
'Tis sufficient that I tell you, Certain Reasons
obliged me to act in the Manner I did, for my
own Preservation; and that, another time, you
shall know my History; which will explain
many things you seem to be surprised at, at
present.</P>
<P>Your History, said Miss <HI>Glanville!</HI> Why,
will you write your own History then?</P>
<P>I shall not write it, said <HI>Arabella;</HI> tho', que∣stionless,
it will be written after my Death.</P>
<P>And must I wait till then for it, resumed
Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> gaily?</P>
<P>No, no, interrupted <HI>Arabella:</HI> I mean to
gratify your Curiosity sooner; but it will not be
yet a good time; and, haply, not till you have
acquainted me with yours.</P>
<P>Mine! said Miss <HI>Glanville:</HI> It would not be
worth your hearing; for really I have nothing
to tell, that would make an History.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="183"/>
You have, questionless, returned <HI>Arabella,</HI>
gained many Victories over Hearts; have oc∣casioned
many Quarrels between your Servants,
by favouring some one, more than the others:
Probably, you have caused some Bloodshed;
and have not escaped being carried away once
or twice: You have also, I suppose, undergone
some Persecution, from those who have the
Disposal of you, in Favour of a Lover whom
you have an Aversion to; and lastly, there is
haply some one among your Admirers, who
is happy enough not to be hated by you.</P>
<P>I assure you, interrupted Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> I hate
none of my Admirers; and I can't help think∣ing
you very unkind to use my Brother as you
do: I am sure, there is not one Man in an hun∣dred,
that would take so much from your Hands
as he does.</P>
<P>Then there is not one Man in an hundred,
resumed <HI>Arabella,</HI> whom I should think worthy
to serve me: But, pray, Madam, What ill
Usage is it your Brother complains of? I have
treated him with much less Severity than he had
Reason to expect; and, notwithstanding he had
the Presumption to talk to me of Love, I have
endured him in my Sight; an Indulgence, for
which I may haply be blamed in After-ages.</P>
<P>Why, sure, Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> said Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI>
it would be no such Crime for my Brother to
love you!</P>
<P>But it was a mortal Crime to tell me so, in∣terrupted
<HI>Arabella.</HI></P>
<P>And why was it such a mortal Crime to tell
you so, said Miss <HI>Glanville?</HI> Are you the first
Woman by Millions, that has been told so?</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="184"/>
Doubtless, returned <HI>Arabella,</HI> I am the first
Woman of my Quality, that ever was told so
by any Man, till after an infinite Number of
Services, and secret Sufferings: And truly, I
am of the illustrious <HI>Mandana</HI>'s Mind; for she
said, That she should think it an unpardonable
Presumption, for the greatest King on Earth to
tell her he loved her, tho' after Ten Years of the
most faithful Services, and concealed Tor∣ments.</P>
<P>Ten Years! cried out Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> in
Amazement; Did she consider what Altera∣tions
ten Years would make in her Face, and
how much older she would be at the End of
Ten Years, than she was before?</P>
<P>Truly, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> it is not usual to consi∣der
such little Matters so nicely; one never has
the Idea of an Heroine older than Eighteen,
tho' her History begins at that Age; and the
Events, which compose it, contain the Space
of Twenty more.</P>
<P>But, dear Cousin, resumed Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI>
do you resolve to be Ten Years a courting? Or
rather, will you be loved in Silence Ten Years,
and be courted the other Ten; and so marry
when you are an old Woman?</P>
<P>Pardon me, Cousin, resumed <HI>Arabella;</HI> I
must really find Fault with the Coarseness of
your Language. Courting, and Old Woman!
What strange Terms! Let us, I beseech you,
end this Dispute: If you have any thing to say in
Justification of your Brother, which, I suppose,
was the chief Intention of your Visit, I shall not
be rude enough to restrain you; tho' I could
wish you would not lay me under the Neces∣sity
<PB N="170" REF="185"/>
of hearing what I cannot persuade myself
to believe.</P>
<P>Since, returned Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> I know of
no Crime my Brother has been guilty of, I have
nothing to say in his Justification: I only know,
that he is very much mortified at the Message
you sent him this Morning; for I was with him
when he received it: But pray, What has he
done to offend you?</P>
<P>If Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> hopes
for my Pardon, he must purchase it by his Re∣pentance,
and a sincere Confession of his Fault;
which you may much better understand from
himself, than from me: And, for this Purpose,
I will condescend to grant him a private Au∣dience,
at which I desire you would be present;
and also, I should take it well, if you will let
him know, that he owes this Favour wholly to
your Interposition.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> who knew her Brother was
extremely desirous of seeing <HI>Arabella,</HI> was glad
to accept of these strange Terms; and left her
Chamber, in order to acquaint him with that
Lady's Intentions.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A solemn Interview.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the mean time, that Fair-one, being risen,
and negligently dressed, as was her Custom,
went into her Closet, sending to give Miss
<PB N="171" REF="186"/>
<HI>Glanville</HI> Notice, That she was ready to see her.
This Message immediately brought both the
Brother and the Sister to her Apartment: And
Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> at her Brother's Request, stay∣ing
in the Chamber, where she busied herself
in looking at her Cousin's Jewels, which lay
upon the Toilet, he came alone into the Clo∣set,
in so much Confusion at the Thoughts of
the ridiculous Figure he made in complying
with <HI>Arabella</HI>'s fantastical Humours, that his
Looks persuading her, there was some great
Agitation in his Mind, she expected to see him
fall at her Feet, and endeavour to deprecate
her Wrath by a Deluge of Tears.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> however disappointed her in
that respect; for, taking a Seat near her, he
began to intreat, her with a smiling Counte∣nance,
to tell him in what he had offended her;
protesting, that he was not conscious of doing
or saying any thing to displease her.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> was greatly confused at this Question,
which she thought she had no Reason to expect;
it not being possible for her to tell him she was
offended, that he was not in absolute Despair for
her Absence, without, at the same time, confessing
she looked upon him in the Light of a Lover,
whose Expressions of a violent Passion would not
have displeased her: Therefore, to disengage
herself from the Perplexity his Question threw
her into, she was obliged to offer some Violence
to her Ingenuousness; and, contrary to her real
Belief, tax him again with a Design of betray∣ing
her into the Power of the Unknown.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> tho' excessively vexed at her
persisting in so ridiculous an Error, could hardly
<PB N="172" REF="187"/>
help smiling at the stern Manner in which she
spoke; but, knowing of what fatal Consequence
it would be to him, if he indulged any Gaiety
in so solemn a Conference, he composed his
Looks to a Gravity suitable to the Occasion;
and asked her, in a very submissive Tone, What
Motive she was pleased to assign for so extra∣ordinary
a Piece of Villainy, as that she supposed
him guilty of?</P>
<P>Truly, answered she, blushing, I do not pre∣tend
to account for the Actions of wicked and
ungenerous Persons.</P>
<P>But, Madam, resumed <HI>Glanville,</HI> if I must needs
be suspected of a Design to seize upon your Per∣son,
methinks it would have been more rea∣sonable
to suppose, I would rather use that Vio∣lence
in Favour of my own Pretensions, than
those of any other whatever; for, tho' you have
expresly forbid me to tell you I love you, yet
I hope, you still continue to think I do.</P>
<P>I assure you, returned <HI>Arabella,</HI> assuming a
severe Look, I never gave myself the Trouble to
examine your Behaviour with Care enough to
be sensible, if you still were guilty of the Weak∣ness,
which displeased me; but, upon a Suppo∣sition,
that you repented of your Fault, I was
willing to live with you upon Terms of Civi∣lity
and Friendship, as became Persons in that
Degree of Relationship in which we are: There∣fore,
if you are wise, you will not renew the Re∣membrance
of those Follies I have long since
pardoned; nor seek Occasions of offending me
by new ones of the same kind, lest it produce a
more severe Sentence than that I formerly laid
upon you.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="188"/>
However, Madam, returned Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI>
you must suffer me to assure you, That my own
Interest, which was greatly concerned in your
Safety, and my Principles of Honour, would
never allow me to engage in so villainous an
Enterprize, as that of abetting any Person in
stealing you away: Nor can I conceive, how
you possibly could imagine a Fellow, who was
your menial Servant, could form so presump∣tuous
and dangerous a Design.</P>
<P>By your Manner of speaking, resumed <HI>Ara∣bella,</HI>
one would imagine you were really igno∣rant,
both of the Quality of that presumptuous
Man, as well as his designed Offence: But
yet, 'tis certain, I saw you in his Company;
and saw you ready to draw your Sword in his
Defence, against my Deliverer. Had I not the
Evidence of my own Senses, for your Guilt, I
must confess, I could not be persuaded of it by
any other Means: Therefore, since Appear∣ances
are certainly against you, it is not strange, if
I cannot consent to acquit you in my Apprehen∣ons,
till I have more certain Confirmation of
your Innocence, than your bare Testimony only;
which, at present, has not all the Weight with
me it had some time ago.</P>
<P>I protest, Madam, said Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who
was strangely perplexed, I have Reason to think
my Case extremely hard, since I have brought
myself to be suspected by you, only through my
Eagerness to find you, and Solicitude for your
Welfare.</P>
<P>Doubtless, interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> if you are
innocent, your Case is extremely hard; yet
it is not singular; and therefore you have
<PB N="174" REF="189"/>
less Reason to complain: The valiant <HI>Corio∣lanus,</HI>
who was the most passionate and faith∣ful
Lover imaginable, having, by his admira∣ble
Valour, assisted the Ravishers of his adored
<HI>Cleopatra,</HI> against those who came to rescue her;
and, by his Arm alone, opposed to great Num∣bers
of their Enemies, facilitated the Execuion
of their Design, had the Mortification after∣wards
to know, that he had, all that time,
been fighting against that Divine Princess, who
loaded him with the most cruel Reproaches for
the Injury he had done her: Yet Fortune was
so kind, as to give him the Means of repairing
his Fault, and restoring him to some Part of
her good Opinion; for, covered with Wounds
as he was, and fatigued with fighting, before,
yet he undertook, in that Condition, to pre∣vent
her Ravishers from carrying her off; and,
for several Hours, continued fighting alone with
near Two hundred Men, who were not able to
overcome him, notwithstanding his extreme
Weariness, and the Multitude of Blows which
they aimed at him: Therefore, <HI>Glanville,</HI> con∣sidering
you, as <HI>Cleopatra</HI> did that unfortunate
Prince, who was before suspected by her, as
neither guilty nor innocent, I can only, like her,
wish you may find some Occasion of justifying
yourself, from the Crime laid to your Charge:
Till then, I must be under a Necessity of banish∣ing
you from my Presence, with the same con∣solatory
Speech she used to that unfortunate
Prince:—<Q>Go, therefore, <HI>Glanville,</HI> go, and
endeavour your own Justification; I desire
you should effect it, no less than you do your∣self;
and, if my Prayers can obtain from
<PB N="175" REF="190"/>
Heaven this Favour for you, I shall not
scruple to offer some <HI>in your behalf.</HI></Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which the Interview is ended, not much
to the Lover's Satisfaction, but ex∣actly
conformable to the Rules of Ro∣mance.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>ARABELLA,</HI> when she had pronounced
these Words, blushed excessively, think∣ing
she had said too much: But, not seeing
any Signs of extreme Joy in the Face of <HI>Glan∣ville,</HI>
who was silently cursing <HI>Cleopatra,</HI> and
the Authors of those Romances, that had ruined
so noble a Mind; and exposed him to perpe∣tual
Vexations, by the unaccountable Whims
they had raised—Why are you not gone, said
she, while I am in an Humour not to repent of
the Favour I have shewn you?</P>
<P>You must excuse me, Cousin, said Mr.
<HI>Glanville,</HI> peevishly, if I do not think so highly
as you do of the Favour. Pray how am I
obliged to you for depriving me of the Pleasure
of seeing you, and sending me on a Wild-goose
Chace, after Occasions to justify myself of a
Crime I am wholly innocent of, and would
scorn to commit?</P>
<P>Though, resumed <HI>Arabella,</HI> with great Calm∣ness,
I have Reason to be dissatisfied with the
cool and unthankful manner in which you re∣ceive
<PB N="176" REF="191"/>
my Indulgence, yet I shall not change the
favourable Disposition I am in towards you, un∣less
you provoke me to it by new Acts of Dis∣obedience:
Therefore, in the Language of
<HI>Cleopatra,</HI> I shall tell you.—</P>
<P>Upon my Soul, Madam, interrupted <HI>Glan∣ville,</HI>
I have no Patience with that rigorous
Gipsy, whose Example you follow so exactly,
to my Sorrow: Speak in your own Language,
I beseech you; for I am sure neither hers,
nor any one's upon Earth, can excel it.</P>
<P>Yet, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> striving to repress some
Inclination to smile at this Sally, notwithstand∣ing
your unjust Prohibitions, I shall make use
of the Language of that incomparable Lady, to
tell you my Thoughts; which are, That 'tis
possible you might be sufficiently justified in my
Apprehensions, by the Anxiety it now appears
you had for my Safety, by the Probability which
I find in your Discourse, and the good Opinion
I have of you, were it not requisite to make
your Innocence apparent to the World, that so
it might be lawful for <HI>Arabella</HI> to readmit you,
with Honour, into her former Esteem and
Friendship.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> seeing it would be in vain to
attempt to make her alter her fantastical Deter∣mination
at this time, went out of the Closet
without deigning to make any Reply to his
Sentence, though delivered in the Language of
the admirable <HI>Cleopatra:</HI> But his ill Humour
was so visible in his Face, that <HI>Arabella,</HI> who
mistook it for an Excess of Despair, could not
help feeling some kind of Pity for the Rigour
which the Laws of Honour and Romance
<PB N="177" REF="192"/>
obliged her to use him with. And, while she
sat meditating upon the Scene which had
just passed, Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> returned to his own
Room, glad that his Sister, not being in <HI>Ara∣bella</HI>'s
Chamber, where he had left her, had no
Opportunity of observing his Discontent, which
she would not fail to inquire the Cause of.</P>
<P>Here he sat, ruminating upon the Follies of
<HI>Arabella,</HI> which he found grew more glaring
every Day: Every thing furnished Matter for
some new Extravagance; her Character was so
ridiculous, that he could propose nothing to
himself but eternal Shame and Disquiet, in the
Possession of a Woman, for whom he must
always blush, and be in Pain. But her Beauty
had made a deep Impression on his Heart: He
admired the Strength of her Understanding;
her lively Wit; the Sweetness of her Temper;
and a Thousand amiable Qualities which di∣stinguished
her from the rest of her Sex: Her
Follies, when opposed to all those Charms of
Mind and Person, seemed inconsiderable and
weak; and, though they were capable of giving
him great Uneasiness, yet they could not lessen
a Passion which every Sight of her so much
the more confirmed.</P>
<P>As he seared it was impossible to help loving
her, his Happiness depended upon curing her of
her romantic Notions; and, though he knew
not how to effect such a Change in her as was
necessary to complete it, yet he would not de∣spair,
but comsorted himself with Hopes of
what he had not Courage to attempt. Some∣times
he fansied Company, and an Acquaint∣ance
with the World, would produce the Al∣teration
<PB N="178" REF="193"/>
he wished: Yet he dreaded to see her
exposed to Ridicule by her fantastical Behaviour,
and become the Jest of Persons who were not
possessed of half her Understanding.</P>
<P>While he traversed his Chamber, wholly
engrossed by these Reflections, Miss <HI>Glanville</HI>
was entertaining Sir <HI>George,</HI> of whose coming
she was informed while she was in <HI>Arabella</HI>'s
Chamber.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which our Heroine is greatly disap∣pointed.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MISS <HI>Glanville,</HI> supposing her Brother
would be glad not to be interrupted in
his Conference with Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> did not allow
any one to acquaint them with Sir <HI>George</HI>'s
Visit; and, telling the Baronet her Cousin was
indisposed, had, by these means, all his Con∣versation
to herself.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George,</HI> who ardently wished to see Lady
<HI>Bella,</HI> protracted his Visit, in hopes that he
should have that Satisfaction before he went
away. And that fair Lady, whose Thoughts
were a little discomposed by the Despair she ap∣prehended
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> was in, and fearful of
the Consequences, when she had sat some time
after he left her, ruminating upon what had
happened, quitted her Closet, to go and inquire
of Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> in what Condition his Mind
<PB N="179" REF="194"/>
seemed to be when he went away; for she never
doubted but that he was gone, like <HI>Coriolanus,</HI>
to seek out for some Occasion to manifest his
Innocence.</P>
<P>Hearing, therefore, the Voice of that Lady,
who was talking and laughing very loud in one
of the Summer-parlours, and being terrified
with the Apprehension, that it was her Brother
with whom she was thus diverting herself, she
opened the Door of the Room precipitately;
and, by her Entrance, filled Sir <HI>George</HI> with
extreme Pleasure; while her unexpected Sight
produced a quite contrary Effect on Miss <HI>Glan∣ville.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> eased of her Fear, that it was Mr.
<HI>Glanville,</HI> who, instead of dying with Despair,
was giving Occasion for that noisy Laugh of his
Sister, saluted the Baronet with great Civility;
and, turning to Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> I must needs
chide you, said she, for the Insensibility with
which it appears you have parted with your
Brother.</P>
<P>Bless me, Madam, interrupted Miss <HI>Glan∣ville,</HI>
what do you mean? Whither is my Brother
gone?</P>
<P>That, indeed, I am quite ignorant of, re∣sumed
<HI>Arabella;</HI> and I suppose he himself hard∣ly
knows what Course he shall take: But he has
been with you, doubtless, to take his Leave.</P>
<P>Take his Leave! repeated Miss <HI>Glanville:</HI>
Has he left the Castle so suddenly then, and
gone away without me?</P>
<P>The Enterprize upon which he is gone, said
<HI>Arabella,</HI> would not admit of a Lady's Com∣pany:
And, since he has left so considerable an
<PB N="180" REF="195"/>
Hostage with me as yourself, I expect he will
not be long before he return; and, I hope, to
the Satisfaction of us both.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> who could not penetrate into
the Meaning of her Cousin's Words, began to
be strangely alarmed: But, presently, supposing
she had a mind to divert herself with her Fears,
she recovered herself, and told her she would go
up to her Brother's Chamber, and look for him.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> did not offer to prevent her, being
very desirous of knowing, whether he had not
left a Letter for her upon his Table, as was the
Custom in those Cases: And, while she was
gone, Sir <HI>George</HI> seized the Opportunity of say∣ing
an hundred gallant Things to her, which
she received with great Indifference; the most
extravagant Compliments being what she ex∣pected
from all Men: And, provided they did
not directly presume to tell her they loved her,
no Sort of Flattery or Adulation could displease
her.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> having
found her Brother in his Chamber, repeated to
him what Lady <HI>Bella</HI> had said, as she supposed,
to fright her.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> hearing this, and that Sir
<HI>George</HI> was with her, hastened to them as fast
as possible, that he might interrupt the foolish
Stories he did not doubt she was telling.</P>
<P>Upon Miss <HI>Glanville</HI>'s Appearance with her
Brother, <HI>Arabella</HI> was astonished.</P>
<P>I apprehended, Sir, said she, that you were
some Miles from the Castle by this time: But
your Delay and Indifference convince me, you
<PB N="181" REF="196"/>
neither expect nor wish to find the means of be∣ing
justified in my Opinion.</P>
<P>Pray, Cousin, interrupted <HI>Glanville</HI> (speaking
softly to her), let us leave this Dispute to some
other time.</P>
<P>No, Sir, resumed she, aloud, my Honour is
concerned in your Justification: Nor is it fit I
should submit to have the Appearance of Amity
for a Person who has not yet sufficiently cleared
himself of a Crime, with too much Reason laid
to his Charge. Did <HI>Coriolanus,</HI> think you, act
in this manner? Ah! if he had, doubtless,
<HI>Cleopatra</HI> would never have pardoned him: Nor
will I any longer suffer you to give me repeated
Causes of Discontent.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George,</HI> seeing Confusion in Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>'s
Countenance, and Rage in <HI>Arabella</HI>'s, began to
think, that what he had at first took for a Jest,
was a serious Quarrel between them, at which
it was not proper he should be present; and was
preparing to go: When <HI>Arabella,</HI> stopping him
with a graceful Action—</P>
<P>If, noble Stranger, said she, you are so par∣tial
to the Failings of a Friend, that you will
undertake to defend any unjustifiable Action he
may be guilty of, you are at Liberty to depart:
But, if you will promise to be an unprejudiced
Hearer of the Dispute between Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>
and myself, you shall know the Adventure
which has given Rise to it; and will be Judge
of the Reasonableness of the Commands I have
laid on him.</P>
<P>Though, Madam, said Sir <HI>George</HI> (bowing
very low to her), Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> is my Friend,
yet there is no Likelihood I shall espouse his In∣terest
<PB N="182" REF="197"/>
against yours: And a very strong Prepos∣session
I feel in Favour of you, already per∣suades
me, that I shall give Sentence on your
Side, since you have honoured me so far, as to
constitute me Judge of this Difference.</P>
<P>The solemn Manner in which Sir <HI>George</HI>
(who began to suspect Lady <HI>Bella</HI>'s peculiar
Turn) spoke this, pleased her infinitely; while
Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> vexed as he was, could hardly
forbear laughing: When <HI>Arabella,</HI> after a Look
of Approbation to Sir <HI>George,</HI> replied;</P>
<P>I find I have unwillingly engaged myself to
more than I first intended: For, to enable you
to judge clearly of the Matter in Dispute, 'tis
necessary you should know my whole History.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> at this Word, not being able
to constrain himself, uttered a Groan, of the
same Nature with those which are often heard in
the Pit at the Representation of a new Play.
Sir <HI>George</HI> understood him perfectly well; yet
seemed surprised: And <HI>Arabella,</HI> starting up,</P>
<P>Since, said she, I have given you no new
Cause of Complaint, pray, from whence pro∣ceeds
this Increase of Affliction?</P>
<P>I assure you, Cousin, answered he, my Af∣fliction,
if you please to term it so, increases
every Day; and I believe it will make me mad
at last: For this unaccountable Humour of
yours is not to be borne.</P>
<P>You do not seem, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> to be far
from Madness already: And if your Friend
here, upon hearing the Passages between us,
should pronounce you guilty, I shall be at a
Loss, whether I ought to treat you as a Mad∣man,
or a Criminal. Sir, added she, turning
<PB N="183" REF="198"/>
to Sir <HI>George,</HI> you will excuse me, if, for cer∣tain
Reasons, I can neither give you my History
myself, nor be present at the Relation of it: One
of my Women, who is most in my Confidence,
shall acquaint you with all the Particulars of
my Life: After which I expect Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>
will abide by your Decision, as, I assure myself,
I shall be contented to do.</P>
<P>Saying this, she went out of the Parlour, in
order to prepare <HI>Lucy</HI> for the Recital she was to
make.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> resolving not to be present at
this new Absurdity, ran out after her; and
went into the Garden, with a strong Inclination
to hate the lovely Visionary who gave him such
perpetual Uneasiness; leaving his Sister alone
with the Baronet, who diverted herself extreme∣ly
with the Thoughts of hearing her Cousin's
History; assuring the Baronet, that he might ex∣pect
something very curious in it, and find Mat∣ter
sufficient to laugh at; for she was the most
whimsical Woman in the World.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George,</HI> who resolved to profit by the
Knowlege of her Foible, made very little Re∣ply
to Miss <HI>Glanville</HI>'s Sneers; but waited pa∣tiently
for the promised History, which was
much longer coming than he imagined.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Some curious Instructions for relating an
History.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>ARABELLA,</HI> as soon as she left them,
went up to her Apartment; and, calling
<HI>Lucy</HI> into her Closet, told her that she had
made Choice of her, since she was best ac∣quainted
with her Thoughts, to relate her
History to her Cousins, and a Person of Quality
who was with them.</P>
<P>Sure your Ladyship jests with me, said <HI>Lucy:</HI>
How can I make a History about your Lady∣ship?</P>
<P>There is no Occasion, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> for
you to make a History: There are Accidents
enough in my Life to afford Matter for a long
one: All you have to do is to relate them as
exactly as possible. You have lived with me
from my Childhood, and are instructed in all
my Adventures; so that you must be certainly
very capable of executing the Task I have ho∣noured
you with.</P>
<P>Indeed, said <HI>Lucy,</HI> I must beg your Ladyship
will excuse me: I never could tell how to re∣peat
a Story when I have read it; and I know
it is not such simple Girls as I can tell Histories:
It is only sit for Clerks, and such Sort of People,
that are very learned.</P>
<P>You are learned enough for that Purpose, said
<HI>Arabella;</HI> and, if you make so much Difficulty
in performing this Part of your Duty, pray how
<PB N="185" REF="200"/>
came you to imagine you were fit for my Ser∣vice,
and the Distinction I have favoured you
with? Did you ever hear of any Woman that
refused to relate her Lady's Story, when desired?
Therefore, if you hope to possess my Favour
and Confidence any longer, acquit yourself
handsomely of this Task, to which I have pre∣ferred
you.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy,</HI> terrified at the Displeasure she saw in
her Lady's Countenance, begged her to tell
her what she must say.</P>
<P>Well! exclaimed <HI>Arabella:</HI> I am certainly
the most unfortunate Woman in the World!
Every thing happens to me in a contrary manner
from any other Person! Here, instead of my
desiring you to soften those Parts of my History
where you have greatest room to flatter; and
to conceal, if possible, some of those Disorders
my Beauty has occasioned; you ask me to tell
you what you must say; as if it was not neces∣sary
you should know as well as myself, and be
able, not only to recount all my Words and
Actions, even the smallest and most inconsider∣able,
but also all my Thoughts, however in∣stantaneous;
relate exactly every Change of my
Countenance; number all my Smiles, Half-smiles,
Blushes, Turnings pale, Glances, Pauses,
Full-stops, Interruptions; the Rise and Falling
of my Voice; every Motion of my Eyes; and
every Gesture which I have used for these Ten
Years past; nor omit the smallest Circumstance
that relates to me.</P>
<P>Lord bless me! Madam, said <HI>Lucy,</HI> exces∣sively
astonished, I never, till this Moment,
it seems, knew the hundredth thousandth Part
<PB N="186" REF="201"/>
of what was expected from me: I am sure, if I
had, I would never have gone to Service; for I
might well know I was not fit for such Slavery.</P>
<P>There is no such great Slavery in doing all I
have mentioned to you, interrupted <HI>Arabella:</HI> It
requires, indeed, a good Memory, in which I
never thought you deficient; for you are
punctual to the greatest Degree of Exactness in
recounting every thing one desires to hear from
you.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy,</HI> whom this Praise soothed into good
Humour, and flattered with a Belief, that she
was able, with a little Instruction, to perform
what her Lady required, told her, if she pleased
only to put her in a Way how to tell her
History, she would engage, after doing it once,
to tell it again whenever she was desired.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> being obliged to comply with the
odd Request, for which there was no Precedent
in all the Romances her Library was stuffed
with, began to inform her in this manner:</P>
<P>First, said she, you must relate my Birth,
which you know is very illustrious; and, be∣cause
I am willing to spare you the Trouble of
repeating Things, that are not absolutely neces∣sary,
you must apologize to your Hearers for
slipping over what passed in my Infancy, and the
first Eight or Ten Years of my Life; not failing,
however, to remark, that, from some sprightly
Sallies of Imagination, at those early Years,
those about me conceived marvellous Hopes of
my future Understanding: From thence you
must proceed to an accurate Description of my
Person.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="202"/>
What! Madam, interrupted <HI>Lucy,</HI> must I
tell what Sort of Person you have, to People
who have seen you but a Moment ago?</P>
<P>Questionless you must, replied <HI>Arabella;</HI> and
herein you follow the Examples of all the 'Squires
and Maids who relate their Masters and Ladies
Histories: For, though it be to a Brother, or
near Relation, who has seen them a thousand
times, yet they never omit an exact Account of
their Persons.</P>
<P>Very well, Madam, said <HI>Lucy:</HI> I shall be
sure not to forget that Part of my Story. I wish
I was as perfect in all the rest.</P>
<P>Then, <HI>Lucy,</HI> you must repeat all the Con∣versations
I have ever held with you upon the
Subjects of Love and Gallantry, that your Au∣dience
may be so well acquainted with my
Humour, as to know exactly, before they are
told, how I shall behave, in whatever Adven∣tures
befal me.—After that, you may proceed
to tell them, how a noble Unknown saw me at
Church; how prodigiously he was struck with
my Appearance; the tumultuous Thoughts
that this first View of me occasioned in his
Mind.—</P>
<P>Indeed, Madam, interrupted <HI>Lucy</HI> again, I
can't pretend to tell his Thoughts: For how
should I know what they were? None but
himself can tell that.</P>
<P>However that may be, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> I ex∣pect
you should decypher all his Thoughts, as
plainly as he himself could do; otherwise my
History will be very imperfect: Well, I suppose
you are at no loss about that whole Adventure,
in which you yourself bore so great a Share; so
<PB N="188" REF="203"/>
need not give you any further Instructions
concerning it: Only you must be sure, as I
said before, not to omit the least Circum∣stance
in my Behaviour, but relate every
thing I did, said, and thought, upon that Oc∣casion.
The disguised Gardener must appear
next in your Story: Here you will of necessity
be a little deficient, since you are not able to
acquaint your Hearers with his true Name and
Quality; which, questionless, is very illustrious.
However, above all, I must charge you not to
mention that egregious Mistake about the Carp;
for, you know how—</P>
<P>Here Miss <HI>Glanville</HI>'s Entrance put a Stop to
the Instructions <HI>Lucy</HI> was receiving: For she
told <HI>Arabella,</HI> that Sir <HI>George</HI> was gone.</P>
<P>How! returned she, is he gone? Truly I
am not much obliged to him for the Indif∣ference
he has shewed to hear my Story.</P>
<P>Why, really, Madam, said Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI>
neither of us expected you would be as good
as your Word, you were so long in sending your
Woman down: And my Brother persuaded Sir
<HI>George</HI> you were only in Jest; and Sir <HI>George</HI> has
carried him home to Dinner.</P>
<P>And is it at Sir <HI>George</HI>'s, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI>
that your Brother hopes to meet with an Occa∣sion
of clearing himself? He is either very in∣sensible
of my Anger, or very conscious of his
own Innocence.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> having nothing to say in
Answer to an Accusation she did not under∣stand,
changed the Discourse: And the two
Ladies passed the rest of the Day together, with
tolerable Good-humour on Miss <HI>Glanville</HI>'s Side;
<PB N="189" REF="204"/>
who was in great hopes of making a Conquest
of the Baronet, before whom <HI>Arabella</HI> had
made herself ridiculous enough: But that Lady
was far from being at Ease; she had laid herself
under a Necessity of banishing Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> if
he did not give some convincing Proof of his
Innocence; which, as Matters stood, she
thought would be very hard for him to procure;
and, as she could not absolutely believe him
guilty, she was concerned she had gone so far.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A very Heroic Chapter.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR. <HI>Glanville,</HI> coming home in the Even∣ing,
a little elevated with the Wine,
of which he had drank too freely at Sir <HI>George</HI>'s,
being told the Ladies were together, entered the
Room where they were sitting; and, beholding
<HI>Arabella,</HI> whose Pensiveness had given an in∣chanting
Softness to her Face, with a Look of
extreme Admiration—</P>
<P>Upon my Soul, Cousin, said he, if you con∣tinue
to treat me so cruelly, you'll drive me
mad. How I could adore you this Moment,
added he, gazing passionately at her, if I might
but hope you did not hate me!</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> who did not perceive the Condition
he was in, was better pleased with this Address
than any he had ever used; and, therefore, instead
<PB N="190" REF="205"/>
of chiding him, as she was wont, for the Free∣dom
of his Expressions, she cast her bright Eyes
upon the Ground, with so charming a Confusion,
that <HI>Glanville,</HI> quite transported, threw himself on
his Knees before her; and, taking her Hand,
attempted to press it to his Lips: But she,
hastily withdrawing it—</P>
<P>From whence is this new Boldness? said she:
And what is it you would implore by that pro∣strate
Posture? I have told you already upon
what Conditions I will grant you my Pardon.
Clear yourself of being an Accomplice with my
designed Ravisher, and I am ready to restore
you to my Esteem.</P>
<P>Let me perish, Madam, returned <HI>Glanville,</HI>
if I would not die to please you, this Moment!</P>
<P>It is not your Death that I require, said she:
And, though you should never be able to justify
yourself in my Opinion, yet you might, haply,
expiate your Crime, by a less Punishment than
Death.</P>
<P>What shall I do, then, my Angelic Cousin?
resumed he.</P>
<P>Truly, said she, the Sense of your Offence
ought so mortally to afflict you, that you should
invent some strange kind of Penance for your∣self,
severe enough to prove your Penitence sin∣cere.—You
know, I suppose, what the unfor∣tunate
<HI>Orontes</HI> did, when he found he had
wronged his adored <HI>Thalestris</HI> by an injurious
Suspicion.</P>
<P>I wish he had hanged himself, said Mr. <HI>Glan∣ville,</HI>
rising up in a Passion, at seeing her again
in her Altitudes.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="206"/>
And why, pray, Sir, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> are you
so severe upon that poor Prince? who was,
haply, infinitely more innocent than yourself.</P>
<P>Severe, Madam! said <HI>Glanville,</HI> fearing he
had offended her: Why, to be sure, he was a
sad Scoundrel, to use his adored <HI>Thalestris</HI> as he
did: And I think one cannot be too severe
upon him.</P>
<P>But, returned <HI>Arabella,</HI> Appearances were
against her; and he had some Shadow of Reason
for his Jealousy and Rage: Then, you know,
amidst all his Transports, he could not be pre∣vailed
upon to draw his Sword against her.</P>
<P>What did that signify? said <HI>Glanville:</HI> I sup∣pose
he scorned to draw his Sword upon a
Woman: That would have been a Shame in∣deed.</P>
<P>That Woman, Sir, resumed <HI>Arabella,</HI> was
not such a contemptible Antagonist as you think
her: And Men, as valiant, possibly, as <HI>Orontes</HI>
(though, questionless, he was one of the most
valiant Men in the World), have been cut in
Pieces by the Sword of that brave <HI>Amazon.</HI></P>
<P>Lord bless me! said Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> I should
be afraid to look at such a terrible Woman: I
am sure she must be a very masculine Sort of
Creature.</P>
<P>You are much mistaken, Miss, said <HI>Arabella:</HI>
For <HI>Thalestris,</HI> tho' the most stout and cou∣rageous
of her Sex, was, nevertheless, a per∣fect
Beauty; and had as much Harmony and
Softness in her Looks and Person, as she had
Courage in her Heart, and Strength in her Blows.</P>
<P>Indeed, Madam, resumed Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> you
can never persuade me, that a Woman who can
<PB N="192" REF="207"/>
sight, and cut People to Pieces with her Blows,
can have any Softness in her Person: She must
needs have very masculine Hands, that could
give such terrible Blows: And I can have no
Notion of the Harmony of a Person's Looks,
who, by what you say, must have the Heart of
a Tyger. But, indeed, I don't think there ever
could be such a Woman.</P>
<P>What! Miss, interrupted <HI>Arabella:</HI> Do you
pretend to doubt, that there ever was such a
Person as <HI>Thalestris,</HI> Queen of the <HI>Amazons?</HI>
Does not all the World know the Adventures
of that illustrious Princess; her Affection for the
unjust <HI>Orontes,</HI> who accused her of having a
scandalous Intrigue with <HI>Alexander,</HI> whom she
went to meet, with a very different Design, up∣on
the Borders of her Kingdom? The injurious
Letter he wrote her, upon this Suspicion, made
her resolve to seek for him all over the World,
to give him that Death he had merited, by her
own Hand: And it was in those Rencounters
that he had with her, while she was thus in∣censed,
that he forbore to defend himself against
her, though her Sword was often pointed to his
Breast.</P>
<P>But, Madam, interrupted Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI>
pray what became of this Queen of the <HI>Ama∣zons?</HI>
Was she not killed at the Siege of <HI>Troy?</HI></P>
<P>She never was at the Siege of <HI>Troy,</HI> returned
<HI>Arabella:</HI> But she assisted the Princes who be∣sieged
<HI>Babylon,</HI> to recover the Liberty of <HI>Sta∣tira</HI>
and <HI>Parisatis:</HI> And it was in the opposite
Party that she met with her faithless Lover.</P>
<P>If he was faithless, Madam, said Mr. <HI>Glan∣ville,</HI>
he deserved to die: And I wish, with all
<PB N="193" REF="208"/>
my Soul, she had cut him in Pieces with that
famous Sword of hers that had done such Won∣ders.</P>
<P>Yet this faithless Man, resumed <HI>Arabella,</HI>
whom you seem to have such an Aversion to, gave
so glorious a Proof of his Repentance and Sor∣row,
that the fair Queen restored him to her
Favour, and held him in much dearer Affection
than ever: For, after he was convinced of her
Innocence, he was resolved to punish himself
with a Rigour equal to the Fault he had been
guilty of; and, retiring to the Woods, abandoned
for ever the Society of Men; dwelling in a
Cave, and living upon bitter Herbs, passing the
Days and Nights in continual Tears and Sor∣row
for his Crime: And here he proposed to
end his Life, had not the fair <HI>Thalestris</HI> found
him out in this Solitude; and, struck with the
Sincerity of his Repentance, pardoned him;
and, as I have said before, restored him to her
Favour.</P>
<P>And, to shew you, said <HI>Glanville,</HI> that I am
capable of doing as much for you; I will, if
you insist upon it, seek out for some Cave, and
do Penance in it, like that <HI>Orontes,</HI> provided
you will come and fetch me out of it, as that
same fair Queen did him.</P>
<P>I do not require so much of you, said <HI>Ara∣bella;</HI>
for I told you before, that, haply, you are
justified already in my Opinion; but yet it is
necessary, you should find out some Method of
convincing the World of your Innocence; other∣wise
it is not fit I should live with you upon
Terms of Friendship and Civility.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="209"/>
Well, well, Madam, said <HI>Glanville,</HI> I'll
convince you of my Innocence, by bringing that
Rascal's Head to you, whom you suspect I
was inclined to assist in stealing you away.</P>
<P>If you do that, resumed <HI>Arabella,</HI> doubtless
you will be iustified in my Opinion, and the
World's also; and I shall have no Scruple to
treat you with as much Friendship as I did be∣fore.</P>
<P>My Brother is much obliged to you, Ma∣dam,
interrupted Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> for putting
him upon an Action, that would cost him his
Life!</P>
<P>I have so good an Opinion of your Brother's
Valour, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> that I am persuaded he
will find no Difficulty in performing his Pro∣mise;
and I make no question but I shall see him
covered with the Spoils of that Impostor, who
would have betrayed me; and I flatter myself,
he will be in a Condition to bring me his Head,
as he bravely promises, without endangering his
own Life.</P>
<P>Does your Ladyship consider, said Miss <HI>Glan∣ville,</HI>
that my Brother can take away no Per∣son's
Life whatever, without endangering his
own?</P>
<P>I consider, Madam, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> your Bro∣ther
as a Man possessed of Virtue and Courage
enough to undertake to kill all my Enemies
and Persecutors, though I had ever so many;
and I presume, he would be able to perform
as many glorious Actions for my Service, as
either <HI>Juba, Caesario, Artamenes,</HI> or <HI>Artaban,</HI>
who, though not a Prince, was greater than any
of them.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="210"/>
If those Persons you have named, said Miss
<HI>Glanville,</HI> were Murderers, and made a Practice
of killing People, I hope my Brother will be
too wise to follow their Examples: A strange
kind of Virtue and Courage indeed, to take
away the Lives of one's Fellow-Creatures! How
did such Wretches escape the Gallows, I won∣der?</P>
<P>I perceive, interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> what kind
of Apprehensions you have: I suppose you
think, if your Brother was to kill my Enemy,
the Law would punish him for it: But pray
undeceive yourself, Miss: The Law has no
Power over Heroes; they may kill as many
Men as they please, without being called to any
Account for it; and the more Lives they take
away, the greater is their Reputation for Virtue
and Glory. The illustrious <HI>Artaban,</HI> from the
Condition of a private Man, raised himself to
the sublimest Pitch of Glory by his Valour; for
he not only would win half a dozen Battles in
a Day; but, to shew that Victory followed him
where-ever he went, he would change Parties,
and immediately the Vanquished became Con∣querors;
then, returning to the Side he had
quitted, changed the Laurels of his former
Friends into Chains. He made nothing of
tumbling Kings from their Thrones, and giving
away half a dozen Crowns in a Morning; for
his Generosity was equal to his Courage; and
to this Height of Power did he raise himself
by his Sword. Beginning at first with petty
Conquests, and not disdaining to oppose his
glorious Arm to sometimes less than a Score of
his Enemies; so, by degrees, enuring himself
<PB N="196" REF="211"/>
to conquer inconsiderable Numbers, he came
at last to be the Terror of whole Armies, who
would fly at the Sight of his single Sword.</P>
<P>This is all very astonishing indeed, said Miss
<HI>Glanville:</HI> However, I must intreat you, not to
insist upon my Brother's quarrelling and fight∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng
with People, since it will be neither for
your Honour, nor his Safety; for I am afraid,
if he was to commit Murder to please you, the
Laws would make him suffer for it; and the
World would be very free with its Censures on
your Ladyship's Reputation, for putting him
upon such shocking Crimes.</P>
<P>By your Discourse, Miss, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI>
one would imagine, you knew as little in what
the good Reputation of a Lady consists, as the
Safety of a Man; for certainly the one depends
intirely upon his Sword, and the other
upon the Noise and Bustle she makes in the
World. The Blood that is shed for a Lady,
enhances the Value of her Charms; and the
more Men a Hero kills, the greater his Glory,
and, by Consequence, the more secure he is.
If to be the Cause of a great many Deaths, can
make a Lady infamous; certainly none were
ever more so, than <HI>Mandana, Cleopatra,</HI> and
<HI>Statira,</HI> the most illustrious Names in Anti∣quity;
for each of whom, haply, an hundred
thousand Men were killed: Yet none were ever
so unjust, as to profane the Virtue of those Di∣vine
Beauties, by casting any Censures upon
them for these glorious Effects of their Charms,
and the heroic Valour of their Admirers.</P>
<P>I must confess, interrupted Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI>
I should not be sorry to have a Duel or Two
<PB N="197" REF="212"/>
fought for me in <HI>Hyde-park;</HI> but then I would
not have any Blood shed for the World.</P>
<P><HI>Glanville</HI> here interrupting his Sister with a
Laugh, <HI>Arabella</HI> also could not forbear smiling
at the harmless Kind of Combats her Cousin
was fond of.</P>
<P>But to put an End to the Conversation, and
the Dispute which gave Rise to it, she obliged
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> to promise to fight with the Im∣postor
<HI>Edward,</HI> whenever he found him; and
either take away his Life, or force him to con∣fess,
he had no Part in the Design he had me∣ditated
against her.</P>
<P>This being agreed upon, <HI>Arabella,</HI> conduct∣ing
Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> to her Chamber, retired to
her own; and passed the Night with much
greater Tranquillity, than she had done the
preceding; being satisfied with the Care she
had taken of her own Glory, and persuaded
that <HI>Glanville</HI> was not unfaithful; a Circum∣stance,
that was of more Consequence to her
Happiness, than she was yet aware of.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which our Heroine is suspected of Insen∣sibility.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHILE these things passed at the
Castle, Sir <HI>George</HI> was meditating on
the Means he should use to acquire the Esteem
of Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> of whose Person he was a little
<PB N="198" REF="213"/>
enamoured, but of her Fortune a great deal
more.</P>
<P>By the Observations he had made on her Be∣haviour,
he discovered her peculiar Turn: He
was well read in Romances himself, and had
actually employed himself some Weeks in giv∣ing
a new Version of the <HI>Grand Cyrus;</HI> but
the prodigious Length of the Task he had under∣taken,
terrified him so much, that he gave it
over: Nevertheless, he was perfectly well ac∣quainted
with the chief Characters in most of
the <HI>French</HI> Romances; could tell every thing
that was borrowed from them, in all the new
Novels that came out; and, being a very accu∣rate
Critic, and a mortal Hater of <HI>Dryden,</HI> ri∣diculed
him for want of Invention, as it appeared
by his having recourse to these Books for the
most shining Characters and Incidents in his
Plays. <HI>Almanzor,</HI> he would say, was the Copy
of the famous <HI>Artaban</HI> in <HI>Cleopatra,</HI> whose Ex∣ploits
<HI>Arabella</HI> had expatiated upon to Miss
<HI>Glanville,</HI> and her Brother: His admired Cha∣racter
of <HI>Melantha</HI> in Marriage <HI>à-la-mode,</HI> was
drawn from <HI>Berissa</HI> in the <HI>Grand Cyrus;</HI> and
the Story of <HI>Osmyn</HI> and <HI>Bensayda,</HI> in his Con∣quest
of <HI>Granada,</HI> taken from <HI>Sesostris</HI> and <HI>Time∣rilla</HI>
in that Romance.</P>
<P>Fraught therefore with the Knowlege of all
the Extravagances and Peculiarities in those
Books, he resolved to make his Addresses to
<HI>Arabella</HI> in the Form they prescribed; and,
not having Delicacy enough to be disgusted with
the Ridicule in her Character, served himself
with her Foible, to effect his Designs.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="214"/>
It being necessary, in order to his better Ac∣quaintance
with <HI>Arabella,</HI> to be upon very
friendly Terms with Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> and her
Brother, he said a thousand gallant Things to
one, and seemed so little offended with the
Gloom he observed upon the Countenance of
the other, who positively assured him, that
<HI>Arabella</HI> meant only to laugh at him, when she
promised him her History, that he intreated
him, with the most obliging Earnestness, to fa∣vour
him with his Company at his House, where
he omitted no sort of Civility, to confirm their
Friendship and Intimacy; and persuaded him,
by several little and seemingly unguarded Ex∣pressions,
that he was not so great an Admirer
of Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> as her agreeable Cousin Miss
<HI>Glanville.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus secured a Footing in the Castle,
he furnished his Memory with all the necessary
Rules of making Love in <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Taste, and
deferred his next Visit no longer than till the
following Day; but Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> being in∣disposed,
and not able to see Company, he knew
it would be in vain to expect to see <HI>Arabella,</HI>
since it was not to be imagined, Miss <HI>Glan∣ville</HI>
could admit of a Visit, her Brother being
ill; and Lady <HI>Bella</HI> must be also necessarily en∣gaged
with her.</P>
<P>Contenting himself, therefore, with having
inquired after the Health of the Two Ladies,
he returned home, not a little vexed at his Dis∣appointment.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>'s Indisposition, increasing every
Day, grew at last dangerous enough to fill his
Sister with extreme Apprehensions. <HI>Arabella,</HI>
<PB N="200" REF="215"/>
keeping up to her Forms, sent regularly every
Day, to inquire after his Health; but did not
offer to go into his Chamber, though Miss
<HI>Glanville</HI> was almost always there.</P>
<P>As she conceived his Sickness to be occasioned
by the Violence of his Passion for her, she ex∣pected
some Overture should be made her by
his Sister, to engage her to make him a Visit;
such a Favour being never granted by any Lady
to a sick Lover, till she was previously informed,
her Presence was necessary to hinder the In∣crease
of his Distemper.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> would not have failed to re∣present
to her Cousin the Incivility and Care∣lesness
of her Behaviour, in not deigning to
come and see her Brother in his Indisposition,
had not Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> imputing this Neglect
to the Nicety of her Notions, which he had
upon other Occasions experienced, absolutely
forbid her to say any thing to her Cousin upon
this Subject.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> being thus forced to Silence,
by the Fear of giving her Brother Uneasiness,
<HI>Arabella</HI> was extremely disappointed to find,
that, in Five Days Illness, no Application had
been made to her, either by the sick Lover, or
his Sister, who she thought interested herself
too little in his Recovery; so that her Glory
obliging her to lay some Constraint upon her∣self,
she behaved with a Coolness and Insensi∣bility,
that increased Miss <HI>Glanville</HI>'s Aversion
to her, while, in Reality, she was extremely
concerned for her Cousin's Illness; but not
supposing it dangerous, since they had not re∣course
to the usual Remedy, of beseeching a
<PB N="201" REF="216"/>
Visit from the Person whose Presence was
alone able to work a Cure, she resolved to wait
patiently the Event.</P>
<P>However, she never failed in her Respect to
Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> whom she visited every Morn∣ing,
before she went to her Brother; and also
constantly dined with her in her own Apart∣ment,
inquiring always, with great Sweetness,
concerning her Brother's Health; when per∣ceiving
her in Tears one Day, as she came in,
as usual, to dine with her, she was extremely
alarmed; and asked with great Precipitation,
If Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> was worse?</P>
<P>He is so bad, Madam, returned Miss <HI>Glan∣ville,</HI>
that I believe it will be necessary to send
for my Papa, for fear he should die, and he
not see him.</P>
<P>Die, Miss! interrupted <HI>Arabella</HI> eagerly:
No, he must not die; and shall not, if the Pity
of <HI>Arabella</HI> is powerful enough to make him
live. Let us go then, Cousin, said she, her
Eyes streaming with Tears; let us go and visit
this dear Brother, whom you lament: Haply
my Sight may repair the Evils my Rigour
has caused him; and since, as I imagine, he has
forborn, through the profound Respect he has
for me, to request the Favour of a Visit, I
will voluntarily bestow it on him, as well for
the Affection I bear you, as because I do not
wish his Death.</P>
<P>You do not wish his Death, Madam! said
Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> excessively angry at a Speech,
in her Opinion, extremely insolent: Is it such
a mighty Favour, pray, not to wish the Death
of my Brother, who never injured you? I am
<PB N="202" REF="217"/>
sure, your Behaviour has been so extremely in∣human,
that I have repented a thousand
times, we ever came to the Castle.</P>
<P>Let us not waste the time in idle Reproaches,
said <HI>Arabella:</HI> If my Rigour has brought your
Brother into this Condition, my Compassion
can draw him out of it: It is no more than
what all do suffer, who are possessed of a vio∣lent
Passion; and few Lovers ever arrive to the
Possession of their Mistresses, without being se∣veral
times brought almost to their Graves,
either by their Severity, or some other Cause:
But nothing is more easy, than to work a Cure,
in these Cases; for the very Sight of the Person
beloved sometimes does it, as it happened to
<HI>Artamenes,</HI> when the Divine <HI>Mandana</HI> con∣descended
to visit him: A few kind Words,
spoken by the fair Princess of <HI>Persia</HI> to <HI>Oroon∣dates,</HI>
recalled him from the Gates of Death;
and one Line from <HI>Parisatis</HI>'s Hand, which
brought a Command to <HI>Lysimachus</HI> to live, made
him not only resolve, but even able, to obey
her.—</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> quite out of Patience at this
tedious Harangue, without any Regard to Cere∣mony,
flounced out of the Room; and ran to
her Brother's Chamber, followed by <HI>Arabella,</HI>
who imputed her rude Haste to a Suspicion,
that her Brother was worse.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>By which we hope the Reader will be dif∣ferently
affected.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AT their Entrance into the Room, Miss
<HI>Glanville</HI> inquired of the Physician, just
going out, How he found her Brother? Who
replied, that his Fever was increased since last
Night; and that it would not (seeing <HI>Arabella</HI>
preparing to go to his Bedside) be proper to
disturb him.</P>
<P>Saying this, he bow'd, and went out; and
Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> repeating what the Physician had
said, begged her to defer speaking to him till
another time.</P>
<P>I know, said she, that he apprehends, the
Sight of me will cause so many tumultuous
Motions in the Soul of his Patient, as may prove
prejudicial to him: Nevertheless, since his
Disorder is, questionless, more in his Mind than
Body, I may prove, haply, a better Physician
than he; since I am more likely, than he, to
cure an Illness I have caused—</P>
<P>Saying this, she walked up to Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>'s
Bedside, who, seeing her, thanked her, with a
weak Voice, for coming to see him; assuring
her, he was very sensible of the Favour she did
him—</P>
<P>You must not, said she, blushing, thank me
too much, lest I think the Favour I have done
you, is really of more Consequence than I
imagined, since it merits so many Acknowlege∣ments:
<PB N="204" REF="219"/>
Your Physician tells us, pursued she,
that your Life is in Danger; but I persuade
myself, you will value it so much from this
Moment, that you will not protract your Cure
any longer.</P>
<P>Are you mad, Madam, whispered Miss <HI>Glan∣ville,</HI>
who stood behind her, to tell my Bro∣ther,
that the Physician says he is in Danger?
I suppose you really wish he may die, or you
would not talk so.</P>
<P>If, answered she, whispering again to Miss
<HI>Glanville,</HI> you are not satisfied with what I have
already done for your Brother, I will go as far
as Modesty will permit me: And gently pulling
open the Curtains;</P>
<P><HI>Glanville,</HI> said she, with a Voice too much
raised for a sick Person's Ear, I grant to your
Sister's Solicitations, what the fair <HI>Statira</HI> did
to an Interest yet more powerful, since, as you
know, it was her own Brother, who pleaded
in Favour of the dying <HI>Orontes:</HI> Therefore,
considering you in a Condition haply no less
dangerous, than that of that passionate Prince,
I condescend, like her, to tell you, that I do not
wish your Death; that I intreat you to live;
and, lastly, by all the Power I have over you,
I command you to recover.</P>
<P>Ending these Words, she closed the Curtain,
that her transported Lover might not see her
Blushes and Confusion, which were so great,
that, to conceal them, even from Miss <HI>Glan∣ville,</HI>
she hurried out of the Room, and retired
to her own Apartment, expecting, in a little
time, to receive a Billet, under the sick Man's
Hand, importing, that, in Obedience to her
<PB N="205" REF="220"/>
Commands, he was recovered, and ready to
throw himself at her Feet, to thank her for that
Life she had bestowed upon him, and to de∣dicate
the Remains of it to her Service.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> who stayed behind her, in a
strange Surprize at her ridiculous Behaviour;
though she longed to know what her Brother
thought of it, finding he continued silent,
would not disturb him. The Shame he con∣ceived
at hearing so absurd a Speech from a
Woman he passionately loved; and the Desire
he had, not to hear his Sister's Sentiments up∣on
it; made him counterfeit Sleep, to avoid
any Discourse with her upon so disagreeable a
Subject.</P>
<P>That Day his Fever increased; and the next,
the Physician pronouncing him in great Dan∣ger,
a Messenger was dispatched to Town, to
hasten the Coming of Sir <HI>Charles;</HI> and poor
Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> was quite inconsoleable, under
the Apprehensions of losing him.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> not to derogate from her Character,
affected great Firmness of Mind upon this Oc∣casion;
she used the most persuasive Eloquence
to moderate her Cousin's Affliction, and caused
all imaginable Care to be taken of Mr. <HI>Glan∣ville:</HI>
While any one was present, her Looks
discovered only a calm and decent Sorrow;
yet when she was alone, or had only her dear
<HI>Lucy</HI> with her, she gave free Vent to her Tears;
and discovered a Grief for Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>'s Ill∣ness,
little different from that she had felt for her
Father's.</P>
<P>As she now visited him constantly every Day,
she took an Opportunity, when she was alone
<PB N="206" REF="221"/>
by his Bedside, to chide him for his Disobedi∣ence,
in not recovering, as she had command∣ed
him.</P>
<P>Dear Cousin, answered he faintly, Can you
imagine, Health is not my Choice? And do
you think, I would suffer these Pains, if I could
possibly ease myself of them?</P>
<P>Those Pains, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> mistaking his
Complaint, ought to have ceased, when the
Cause of them did; and when I was no longer
rigorous, you ought no longer to have suffer∣ed:
But tell me, since you are, questionless,
one of the strangest Men in the World, and
the hardest to be comforted; nay, and I may
add, the most disobedient of all, that ever
wore the Fetters of Love; Tell me, I say,
what must I do to content you?</P>
<P>If I live, Cousin, said <HI>Glanville</HI>—</P>
<P>Nay, interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> since my Empire
over you is not so absolute as I thought; and
since you think fit to reserve to yourself the
Liberty of dying, contrary to my Desire; I
think I had better resolve, not to make any
Treaty with you: However, as I have gone
thus far, I will do something more; and tell
you, since I have commanded you to live, I
will also permit you to love me, in order to
make the Life I have bestowed on you, worthy
your Acceptance. Make me no Reply, said
she, putting her Hand on his Mouth; but be∣gin
from this Moment to obey me.</P>
<P>Saying this, she went out of the Room—</P>
<P>A few Hours after, his Fever being come to
a Height, he grew delirious, and talked very
wildly; but a favourable Crisis ensuing, he fell
<PB N="207" REF="222"/>
into a sound and quiet Sleep, and continued in
it for several Hours: Upon his waking, the
Physician declared, his Fever was greatly aba∣ted;
and the next Morning, pronounced him
out of Danger—</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> transported with Joy, ran to
Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> and informed her of this good News;
but as she did not make her the Acknowledge∣ments
she expected, for being the Cause of his
Recovery, she behaved with more Reserve
than Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> thought was necessary:
Which renewed her former Disgusts; yet, dread∣ing
to displease her Brother, she concealed it
from the Observation of her Cousin—</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> being desirous of completing her
Lover's Cure by some more favourable Ex∣pressions,
went to his Chamber, accompanied
by Miss <HI>Glanville.</HI></P>
<P>I see, said she, approaching to his Bedside,
with an inchanting Smile, that you know how
to be obedient, when you please; and I begin
to know, by the Price you set upon your Obe∣dience,
that small Favours will not content you.</P>
<P>Indeed, my dearest Cousin, said <HI>Glanville,</HI>
who had found her more interested in his Re∣covery
than he expected, you have been very
obliging, and I will always most gratefully own
it.</P>
<P>I am glad, interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> that Gra∣titude
is not banished from all your Family; and
that that Person in it, for whom I have the most
Sensibility, is not intirely divested of it—</P>
<P>I hope, said Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> my Sister has
given you no Cause to complain of her.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="223"/>
Indeed but she has, replied <HI>Arabella;</HI> for,
notwithstanding she is obliged to me for the
Life of a Brother, whom questionless she loves
very well; nevertheless, she did not deign to
make me the least Acknowledgement for what I
have done in your Favour: However, <HI>Glan∣ville,</HI>
provided you continue to observe that
Respect and Fidelity towards me, which I have
Reason to hope for from you; your Condition
shall be never the worse for Miss <HI>Glanville</HI>'s un∣acknowleging
Temper; and I now confirm
the Grant I Yesterday made you, and repeat
it again; That I permit you to love me, and
promise you not to be displeased at any Testi∣monies
you will give me of your Passion, pro∣vided
you serve me with an inviolable Fidelity.</P>
<P>But, Madam, returned Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> to
make my Happiness complete, you must also
promise to love me; or else what signifies the
Permission you give me to love you?</P>
<P>You are almost as unacknowleging as your
Sister, resumed <HI>Arabella,</HI> blushing; and if your
Health was perfectly re-established, questionless,
I should chide you for your Presumption; but
since something must be allowed to sick Per∣sons,
whose Reason, one may suppose, is weak∣ened
by their Indisposition, I will pardon your
Indiscretion at this time, and counsel you to
wait patiently for what Heaven will determine
in your Favour: Therefore endeavour to merit
my Affection by your Respect, Fidelity, and
Services; and hope from my Justice, what∣ever
it ought to bestow—</P>
<P>Ending this Speech, with a Solemnity of Ac∣cent,
that gave Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> to understand,
<PB N="209" REF="224"/>
any Reply would offend her, he silently kissed
her fair Hand, which she held out to him; a
Favour, the Terms upon which they now were,
and his Sickness, gave him a Right to expect—
And, finishing her Visit for that time, left him
to his Repose; being extremely pleased at the
Prospect of his Recovery, and very well satisfied
at having so gracefully got over so great a Diffi∣culty,
as that of giving him Permission to love
her: For by the Laws of Romance, when a Lady
has once given her Lover that Permission, she
may lawfully allow him to talk to her upon the
Subject of his Passion, accept all his Gallan∣tries,
and claim an absolute Empire over all his
Actions; reserving to herself the Right of fix∣ing
the Time when she may own her Affection:
And when that important Step is taken, and his
Constancy put to a few Years more Trial; when
he has killed all his Rivals, and rescued her from
a thousand Dangers; she at last condescends to
reward him with her Hand; and all her Ad∣ventures
are at an End for the future.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which our Heroine discovers her Know∣lege
in Astronomy.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>IR <HI>George,</HI> who had never missed
a Day, during Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>'s
Illness, in sending to the Castle,
now he was able to see Company,
visited him very frequently; and
sometimes had the Happiness to
meet with <HI>Arabella</HI> in his Chamber: But,
knowing the Conditions of her Father's Will,
and Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>'s Pretensions, he was obliged
to lay so much Constraint upon himself, in the
Presence of Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> and her Brother, that
<PB N="212" REF="226"/>
he hardly durst trust his Eyes, to express his Ad∣miration
of her, for Fear of alarming them with
any Suspicion of his Designs: However, he
did not fail to recommend himself to her
Esteem, by a Behaviour to her full of the most
perfect Respect; and very often, ere he was
aware, uttered some of the extravagant Com∣pliments,
that the Gallants in the <HI>French</HI> Ro∣mances
use to their Mistresses.</P>
<P>If he walked with her in the Gardens, he
would observe, that the Flowers, which were
before languishing and pale, bloomed with fresh
Beauty at her Approach; that the Sun shined
out with double Brightness, to exceed, if possible,
the Lustre of her Eyes; and that the Wind,
fond of kissing her celestial Countenance, played
with her fair Hair; and, by gentle Murmurs,
declared its Happiness—</P>
<P>If Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> happened to be present,
when he talked to her in this Strain, she would
suppose he was ridiculing her Cousin's fan∣tastical
Turn; and when she had an Opportu∣nity
of speaking to him alone, would chide him,
with a great deal of good Humour, for giving
hrr so much Diversion at her Cousin's Ex∣pence.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George,</HI> improving this Hint, persuaded
Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> by his Answers, that he really
laughed at <HI>Arabella;</HI> and, being now less fear∣ful
of giving any Suspicion to the gay Coquet,
since she assisted him to deceive her, he applied
himself, with more Assiduity than ever, to insi∣nuate
himself into <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Flavour.</P>
<P>However, the Necessity he was under of be∣ing
always of <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Opinion, sometimes
<PB N="213" REF="227"/>
drew him into little Difficulties with Miss <HI>Glan∣ville.</HI>
Knowing that young Lady was extremely
fond of Scandal, he told her, as a most agree∣able
Piece of News, one Afternoon when he
was there, that he had seen Miss <HI>Groves,</HI> who,
he supposed, had come into the Country upon
the same Account as she had done a Twelve∣month
before: Her Marriage being yet a
Secret, the complaisant Baronet threw out an
Hint or two, concerning the Familiarity and
Correspondence there was between her and the
Gentleman to whom she was really secretly
married.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> making the most of this Intel∣ligence,
said a thousand severe Things against
the unfortunate Miss <HI>Groves;</HI> which <HI>Arabella,</HI>
always benevolent and kind, could not bear.</P>
<P>I persuade myself, said she to her Cousin,
that you have been misinformed concerning this
Beauty, whose Misfortunes you aggravate by
your cruel Censures; and whoever has given
you the History of her Life, has, haply, done it
with great Injustice—</P>
<P>Why, Madam, interrupted Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI>
do you think you are better acquainted with her
History, as you call it, who have never been in
Town, where her Follies made her so remark∣able,
than Persons who were Eye-witnesses of
all her ridiculous Actions?</P>
<P>I apprehend, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> that I, who have
had a Relation made to me of all the Passages
of her Life, and have been told all her most
secret Thoughts, may know as much, if not
more, than Persons who have lived in the same
Place with her, and have not had that Advan∣tage;
<PB N="214" REF="228"/>
and I think, I know enough to vindi∣cate
her from many cruel Aspersions.</P>
<P>Pray, Madam, returned Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> will
your Ladyship pretend to defend her scandalous
Commerce with Mr. <HI>L</HI>—?</P>
<P>I know not, Miss, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> why you
call her Intercourse with that perjured Man by
so unjust an Epithet. If Miss <HI>Groves</HI> be unchaste,
so was the renowned <HI>Cleopatra,</HI> whose Marriage
with <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> is controverted to this Day.</P>
<P>And what Reasons, Madam, said Miss <HI>Glan∣ville,</HI>
have you for supposing, Miss <HI>Groves</HI> was
married to Mr. <HI>L</HI>—, since all the World
knows to the contrary?</P>
<P>Very sufficient ones, said <HI>Arabella;</HI> since it is
hardly possible to suppose, a young Lady of Miss
<HI>Groves</HI>'s Quality would stain the Lustre of her
Descent by so shameful an Intrigue; and also,
since there are Examples enough to be found of
Persons, who suffered under the same unhappy
Circumstances as herself; yet were perfectly
innocent, as was that great Queen I have men∣tioned;
who questionless, you, Sir, are suffi∣ciently
convinced, was married to that illustrious
Conqueror; who, by betraying so great and so
fair a Queen, in great measure tarnished the
Glory of his Laurels—</P>
<P>Married, Madam! replied Sir <HI>George:</HI> Who
presumes to say, that fair Queen was not mar∣ried
to that illustrious Conqueror?</P>
<P>Nay, you know, Sir, interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI>
many People did say, even while she was living,
that she was not married; and have branded her
Memory with infamous Calumnies, upon Ac∣count
of the Son she had by <HI>Caesar,</HI> the brave
<PB N="215" REF="229"/>
<HI>Caesario,</HI> who, under the Name of <HI>Cleomedon,</HI>
performed such Miracles of Valour in <HI>Ethiopia.</HI></P>
<P>I assure you, Madam, said Sir <HI>George,</HI> I was
always a great Admirer of the famous <HI>Cleome∣don,</HI>
who was certainly the greatest Hero in the
World.</P>
<P>Pardon me, Sir, said <HI>Arabella; Cleomedon</HI>
was, questionless, a very valiant Man; but he,
and all the Heroes that ever were, must give
place to the unequalled Prince of <HI>Mauritania;</HI>
that illustrious, and for a long time unfortunate,
Lover of the Divine <HI>Cleopatra,</HI> who was Daugh∣ter,
as you questionless know, of the great
Queen we have been speaking of—</P>
<P>Dear Heart! said Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> What is
all this to the Purpose? I would fain know,
whether Sir <HI>George</HI> believes, Miss <HI>Groves</HI> was
ever married to Mr. <HI>L</HI>—.</P>
<P>Doubtless, I do, said he; for, as Lady <HI>Bella</HI>
says, she is in the same unhappy Circumstance
with the great <HI>Cleopatra;</HI> and if <HI>Julius Caesar</HI>
could be guilty of denying his Marriage with
that Queen, I see no Reason to suppose, why
Mr. <HI>L</HI>—might not be guilty of the same
kind of Injustice.</P>
<P>So then, interrupted Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> blushing
with Spite, you will really offer to maintain,
that Miss <HI>Groves</HI> was married? Ridiculous!
How such a Report would be laughed at in <HI>Lon∣don!</HI></P>
<P>I assure you, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> if ever I go to
<HI>London,</HI> I shall not scruple to maintain that
Opinion to every one, who will mention that
Fair-one to me; and use all my Endeavours to
confirm them in it.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="230"/>
Your Ladyship would do well, said Miss
<HI>Glanville,</HI> to persuade People, that Miss <HI>Groves,</HI>
at Fifteen, did not want to run away with her
Writing-master.</P>
<P>As I am persuaded myself, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> that
Writing master was some noble Stranger in
Disguise, who was passionately in Love with her,
I shall not suffer any body, in my Hearing, to
propagate such an unlikely Story; but since he
was a Person worthy of her Affection, if she had
run away with him, her Fault was not without
Example, and even Excuse: You know what
the fair <HI>Artemisa</HI> did for <HI>Alexander,</HI> Sir, pur∣sued
she, turning to Sir <HI>George:</HI> I would fain
know your Sentiments upon the Action of that
Princess, which some have not scrupled to con∣demn—</P>
<P>Whoever they are, Madam, said Sir <HI>George,</HI>
who condemn the fair <HI>Artemisa</HI> for what she
did for <HI>Alexander,</HI> are Miscreants and Slan∣derers;
and though that beautiful Princess has
been dead more than Two thousand Years, I
would draw my Sword in Defence of her Cha∣racter,
against all who should presume, in my
Presence, to cast any Censures upon it.</P>
<P>Since you are so courageous, said Miss <HI>Glan∣ville,</HI>
laughing excessively at this Sally, which,
she thought, was to ridicule her Cousin; it is
to be hoped, you will defend a living Lady's
Character, who may thank you for it; and
make the World believe, that her Correspond∣ence
with Mr. <HI>L</HI>—was intirely innocent;
and that she never had any Design to run away
with her Writing-master.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="231"/>
Are you resolved, Cousin, said Lady <HI>Bella,</HI>
to persist in that ridiculous Mistake, and take
a Nobleman for a Writing-master only be∣cause
his Love put him upon such a Stratagem
to obtain his Mistress?</P>
<P>Indeed, Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> said Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> smile∣ing,
you may as well persuade me, the Moon
is made of a Cream Cheese, as that any Noble∣man
turned himself into a Writing-master, to
obtain Miss <HI>Groves</HI>—</P>
<P>Is it possible, Miss, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> that you
can offer such an Affront to my Understanding,
as to suppose, I would argue upon such a ridi∣culous
System; and compare the Second glo∣rious
Luminary of the Heavens to so unwor∣thy
a Resemblance? I have taken some Pains
to contemplate the Heavenly Bodies; and, by
Reading and Observation, am able to compre∣hend
some Part of their Excellence: Therefore
it is not probable, I should descend to such
trivial Comparisons; and liken a Planet, which,
haply, is not much less than our Earth, to a
thing so inconsiderable, as that you name—</P>
<P>Pardon me, dear Cousin, interrupted Miss
<HI>Glanville,</HI> laughing louder than before, if I di∣vert
myself a little with the Extravagance of
your Notions. Really I think, you have no
Reason to be angry, if I supposed you might
make a Comparison between the Moon and
a Cream Cheese; since you say, that same
Moon, which don't appear broader than your
Gardener's Face, is not much less than the
whole World: Why, certainly, I have more
Reason to trust my own Eyes, than such whim∣sical
Notions as these.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="232"/>
<HI>Arabella,</HI> unwilling to expose her Cousin's Ig∣norance,
by a longer Dispute upon this Sub∣ject,
begged her to let it drop for the present;
and, turning to Sir <HI>George,</HI> I am very glad, said
she, that having always had some Inclination to
excuse, and even defend, the Flight of <HI>Arte∣misa</HI>
with <HI>Alexander,</HI> my Opinion is warranted
by that of a Person so generous as yourself: In∣deed,
when we consider, that this Princess for∣sook
her Brother's Dominions, and fled away
with a Lover whom she did not hate; question∣less,
her Enemies accuse her, with some Ap∣pearance
of Reason, of too great Imbecillity.</P>
<P>But, Madam, replied Sir <HI>George,</HI> her Ene∣mies
will not take the Pains to examine her
Reasons for this Conduct—</P>
<P>True, Sir, resumed <HI>Arabella;</HI> for she was in
Danger of seeing a Prince, who loved her, put to
a cruel and infamous Death upon a public Scaf∣fold;
and she did not resolve to fly with him,
till all her Tears and Prayers were found in∣effectual
to move the King her Brother to
Mercy.</P>
<P>Tho', replied Sir <HI>George,</HI> I am extremely
angry with the indiscreet <HI>Cepio,</HI> who discovered
<HI>Alexander</HI> to the <HI>Armenian</HI> King; yet what does
your Ladyship think of that gallant Action of
his, when he saw him upon the Scaffold, and
the Executioner ready to cut off his Head? How
brave it was of him, to pass undauntedly thro'
the prodigious Number of Guards that environ∣ed
the Scaffold; and, with his drawn Sword, run
the Executioner through-the Body, in the Sight
of them all! Then giving the Prince another
<PB N="219" REF="233"/>
Sword, engage more than Two thousand Men
in his Defence!</P>
<P>Questionless, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> it was a glo∣rious
Action; and when I think, how the King
of <HI>Armenia</HI> was enraged to see such a Multi∣tude
of Soldiers fly from the Swords of Two
Men, I cannot choose but divert myself with
the Consternation he was in: Yet that was no∣thing
to the horrible Despair, which tormented
him afterwards, when he found, that <HI>Alexander,</HI>
after being again taken and imprisoned, had
broken his Chains, and carried away with him
the Princess <HI>Artimesa</HI> his Sister.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which a very pleasing Conversation is
left unfinished.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS <HI>Arabella</HI> was in this Part of her Dis∣course,
a Servant came to inform her, that
Sir <HI>Charles Glanville</HI> was just alighted. Upon
which, Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> flew to receive her Father;
and <HI>Arabella,</HI> walking a little slower after her,
gave Sir <HI>George</HI> an Opportunity of holding a little
longer Conversation with her.</P>
<P>I dare believe, Madam, said he, when you
read the Story of the unfortunate <HI>Alexander,</HI>
your fair Eyes did not refuse to shed some
Tears at the barbarous and shameful Death
he was going to suffer: Yet I assure you▪ me¦lancholy as his Situation was, it was also very
<PB N="220" REF="234"/>
glorious for him, since he had the sublime
Satisfaction of dying for the Person he adored;
and had the ravishing Pleasure to know, that his
Fate would draw Tears from that lovely Prin∣cess,
for whom he sacrificed his Life: Such a
Condition, Madam, ought to be envied rather
than pitied; for, next to the Happiness of pos∣sessing
the Person one adores, certainly the
Glory of dying for her is most to be coveted.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> pleasingly surprised to hear Lan∣guage
so conformable to her own Ideas, looked
for a Moment upon the Baronet, with a most
inchanting Complaisancy in her Eyes—</P>
<P>It must be confessed, Sir, said she, that you
speak very rationally upon these Matters; and
by the Tenderness and Generosity of your Sen∣timents,
you give me Cause to believe, that
your Heart is prepossessed with some▪ Object
worthy of inspiring them.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George</HI> seeming, as if he struggled to sup∣press
a Sigh; You are in the right, Madam,
said he, to suppose, that if my Heart be
prepossessed with any Object, it is with one,
who is capable of inspiring a very sublime Pas∣sion;
and I assure you, if ever it submits to any
Fetters, they shall be imposed on me by the
fairest Person in the World—</P>
<P>Since Love is not voluntary, replied <HI>Ara∣bella,</HI>
smiling, it may happen, that your Heart
may be surprised by a meaner Beauty, than
such a one as you describe: However, as a
Lover has always an extraordinary Partiality
for the beloved Object, 'tis probable, what
you say may come to pass; and you may be
<PB N="221" REF="235"/>
in Love with the fairest Person in the World,
in your own Opinion.</P>
<P>They were now so near the House, that Sir
<HI>George</HI> could reply no other ways, than by a very
passionate Glance, which <HI>Arabella</HI> did not ob∣serve,
being in haste to pay her Respects to her
Uncle, whom she met just going to Mr. <HI>Glan∣ville.</HI>
Her Looks were directed to him. Sir
<HI>Charles</HI> saluting her with great Affection, they
all went into Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>'s Chamber, who
received his Father with the utmost Respect and
Tenderness; extremely regretting the Trouble
he had been at in taking a Journey to the
Castle upon his Account; and gently blaming
his Sister for her Precipitancy in alarming him
so soon.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> extremely overjoyed to find him
so well recovered, would not allow him to
blame Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> for what she had done:
but, addressing himself to his Niece, he thanked
her for the Care she had taken of Mr. <HI>Glan∣ville,</HI>
in very obliging Terms.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> could not help blushing at her
Uncle's Compliment, supposing he thanked her
for having restored her Cousin to his Health.</P>
<P>I assure you, Sir, said she, Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> is
less obliged to my Commands, than to the
Goodness of his Constitution, for his Recovery;
and herein he was not so obedient, as many
Persons I could name to him.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> willing to prevent the Com∣pany's
Observation upon this Speech, began to
acquaint his Father with the Rise and Pro∣gress
of his Distemper: But though the old
Gentleman listened with great Attention to his
<PB N="222" REF="236"/>
Son, while he was speaking; yet not having lost
a Word of what <HI>Arabella</HI> had said, as soon as he
was done, he turned to his Niece, and asked
her, how she could be so unjust, to accuse his
Son of Disobedience, because he did not reco∣ver,
when she commanded him? Why, Ma∣dam,
added he, you want to carry your Power
farther then ever any Beauty did before you;
since you pretend to make People sick and well,
whenever you please.</P>
<P>Really, Sir, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> I pretend to
no more Power, than what I presume all others
of my Sex have upon the like Occasions; and
since nothing is more common, than for a
Gentleman, though ever so sick, to recover in
Obedience to the Commands of that Person,
who has an absolute Power over his Life, I
conceive, I have a Right to think myself in∣jured,
if Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> contrary to mine, had
thought proper to die—</P>
<P>Since, said the old Gentlemen, smiling, my
Son has so well obeyed your Commands in re∣covering
his Health, I shall tremble, lest, in
Obedience to a contrary Command of yours, he
should die, and deprive me of an Heir; a Mis∣fortune,
which, if it should happen, I should
place to your Account.</P>
<P>I assure you, Sir, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> very gravely,
I have too great an Esteem for Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI>
to condemn him to so severe a Punishment as
Death for light Offences: And since it is not
very probable, that he will ever commit such
Crimes against me, as can be only expiated by
his Death; such as Infidelity, Disobedience,
<PB N="223" REF="237"/>
and the like; you have no Reason to fear such
a Misfortune by my means—</P>
<P>Alas! replied Sir <HI>George,</HI> you Beauties make
very nice Distinctions in these Cases; and
think, if you do not directly command your
Lovers to die, you are no-ways accountable for
their Death: And when a Lover, as it often
happens, dies through Despair of ever being able
to make himself beloved; or, being doomed to
Banishment or Silence, falls into a Fever, from
which nothing but Kindness can recover him▪
and, that being denied, he patiently expires; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
say, when these Things happen, as they cer∣tainly
do every Day; How can you hold your selves
guiltless of their Deaths, which are ap∣parently
occasioned, either by your Scorn or
Insensibility?</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles</HI> and Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> were ex¦tremely
diverted at this Speech of Sir <HI>George</HI>'s;
and Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> though he would have wish∣ed
he had been raillying any other Person's Follies
than his Cousin's, yet could not help smiling at
the solemn Accent, in which he delivered him∣self—</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> mightily pleased with his Manner of
talking, was resolved to furnish him with more
Occasions of diverting the Company at her Ex∣pence.</P>
<P>I see, answered she, you are one of those
Persons, who call a just Decorum, which all
Ladies, who love Glory as they ought to do,
are obliged to preserve, by the Name of Seve∣rity:
But pray, what would you have a Lady
do, whom an importunate Lover presumes to
declare his Passion to? You know it is not per∣mitted
<PB N="224" REF="238"/>
us to listen to such Discourses; and
you know also, whoever is guilty of such an
Offence, merits a most rigorous Punishment:
Moreover, you find, that when a Sentence of
Banishment or Silence is pronounced upon them,
these unhappy Criminals are so conscious of the
of Justice their Doom, that they never murmur
against their Judge who condemns them; and
therefore, whatever are their Fates, in Conse∣quence
of that Anger they have incurred, the
Ladies, thus offended, ought not to be charged
with it, as any cruel Exertion of their Power.</P>
<P>Such Eloquence as yours, Madam, replied
Sir <HI>George,</HI> might defend Things yet more un∣justifiable:
However, you must give me Leave,
as being interested in the Safety of my Sex,
still to be of Opinion, that no Man ought to
be hated, because he adores a beautiful Object,
and consecrates all his Moments to her Ser∣vice.</P>
<P>Questionless, resumed <HI>Arabella,</HI> he will not
be hated, while, out of the Respect and Reverence
he bears her, he carefully conceals his Passion
from her Knowlege; but as soon as ever he
breaks through the Bounds, which that Re∣spect
prescribes him, and lets her understand
his true Sentiments, he has Reason to expect
a most rigorous Sentence, since he certainly, by
that Presumption, has greatly deserved it.</P>
<P>If the Ladies, replied Sir <HI>George,</HI> were more
equitable, and would make some Distinction
between those who really love them in a pas∣sionate
and respectful Silence, and others who
do not feel the Power of their Charms, they
might spare themselves the Trouble of hearing
<PB N="225" REF="239"/>
what so mortally offends them: But when a
Lady sees a Man every Day, who by his Looks,
Sighs, and Solicitude to please her, by his num∣berless
Services and constant Attendance of her,
makes it evident, that his Soul is possessed with
a violent Passion for her; I say, when a Lady
sees, and yet will not see, all this, and persists
in using a passionate Adorer with all the Indif∣ference
due to a Man wholly insensible of the
Power of her Charms; what must he do in
such a mortifying Situation, but make known
his Torments to her that occasions them, in
order to prevail upon her to have some Sense
of what he does and feels hourly for her sake?</P>
<P>But since he gains nothing by the Discovery
of his Passion, resumed <HI>Arabella;</HI> but, on the
contrary, loses the Advantages he was before
possessed of, which were very great, since he
might see and discourse with his Mistress every
Day; and, haply, have the Honour to do her a great
many petty Services, and receive some of her
Commands; all these Advantages he loses, when
he declares he loves: And truly, I think, a Man
who is so unwise as to hazard a certain Happiness
for a very improbable Hope, deserves to be
punished, as well for his Folly as Presumption;
and, upon both these Accounts, Banishment is
not too rigorous a Sentence.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Definition of Love and Beauty.—The
necessary Qualities of a Hero and
Heroine.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THOUGH, replied Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> you
are very severe in the Treatment you think
it necessary our Sex should receive from yours;
yet I wish some of our Town Beauties were,
if not altogether of your Opinion, yet suffi∣ciently
so, as to make it not a Slavery for a
Man to be in their Company; for unless one
talks of Love to these fair Conquets the whole
time one is with them, they are quite dis∣pleased,
and look upon a Man who can think
any thing, but themselves, worthy his Thoughts
or Observation, with the utmost Contempt.
How often have you and I, Sir <HI>George,</HI> pursued
he, pitied the Condition of the few Men of
Sense, who are sometimes among the Croud of
Beaux, who attend the Two Sister Beauties
to all Places of polite Diversion in Town? For
those Ladies think it a mortal Injury done to
their Charms, if the Men about them have
Eyes or Ears for any Object but their Faces,
or any Sound but that of their Voices: So that
the Connoisseurs in Music, who attend them to
<HI>Ranelagh,</HI> must stop their Ears, like <HI>Ulysses,</HI>
when the <HI>Siren Frasi</HI> sings; and the Wits, who
gallant them to the Side box, must lay a much
greater Constraint upon themselves, in order to
<PB N="227" REF="241"/>
resist the Soul-moving <HI>Garrick;</HI> and appear in∣sensible,
while he is upon the Stage.</P>
<P>Upon my Soul, added Sir <HI>George</HI> (forgetting
the Character he assumed) when I have seen
some Persons of my Acquaintance talking to
the eldest of these Ladies, while one of <HI>Con∣greve</HI>'s
Comedies has been acting; his Face
quite turned from the Stage, and hers over∣spread
with an eternal Smile; her fine Eyes
sometimes lifted up in a beautiful Surprize, and
a little inchanting Giggle half-hid with her Fan▪
in spite of their Inattention, I have been ready
to imagine, he was entertaining her with Re∣marks
upon the Play, which she was judi∣cious
enough to understand; and yet I have
afterwards been informed by himself, that
nothing was less in their Thoughts; and
all that Variety in her Face, and that extreme
seeming Earnestness in his Discourse, was oc∣casioned
by the most trifling Subjects imagin∣able:
He perhaps had been telling her, how
the Sight of her Squirrel, which peeped out of
her Pocket, surprised some Ladies she was
visiting; and what they said upon her Pondness
for it, when she was gone; blaming them at the
same time for their want of Delicacy, in not
knowing how to set a right Value upon such
pleasing Animals: Hence proceeded her Smiles,
the lifting up of her Eyes, the half-stifled
Laugh, and all the pretty Gestures that appeared
so wonderfully charming to all those who did
not hear their Discourse: And it is upon such
Trifies as these, or else on the inexhaustible
Subject of their Charms, that all who are am∣bitious
<PB N="228" REF="242"/>
of being near these Miracles, are under
a Necessity of talking.</P>
<P>And pray, interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> What Sub∣jects
afford Matter for a more pleasing Variety
of Conversation, than those of Beauty and
Love? Can we speak of any Object so capable
of delighting as Beauty, or of any Passion of the
Mind more sublime and pleasing than Love?</P>
<P>With Submission, Madam, said <HI>Glanville,</HI> I
conceive, all that can be said, either of Beauty,
or of Love, may be comprised in a very few
Words: All who have Eyes, and behold true
Beauty, will be ready to confess it is a very
pleasing Object; and all that can be said of it,
may be said in very few Words; for when we
have run over the Catalogue of Charms, and
mentioned fine Eyes, fine Hair, delicate Com∣plexion,
regular Features, and an elegant Shape,
we can only add a few Epithets more, such as
Lovely, Dangerous, Inchanting, Inresistible,
and the like; and every thing that can be said
of Beauty is exhausted. And so likewise it is
with Love; we know that Admiration pre∣cedes
it, that Beauty kindles it, Hope keeps it
alive, and Despair puts an End to it; and that
Subject may be as soon discussed as the other,
by the judicious Use of proper Words; such as
Wounds, Darts, Fires, Languishings, Dyings,
Torture, Rack, Jealousy, and a few more of
no Signification, but upon th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Subject.</P>
<P>Certainly, Sir, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> you have not
well considered what you say, since you main∣tain,
that Love and Beauty are Subjects easily
and quickly discussed: Take the Pains, I beseech
you, to reflect a little upon those numerous and
<PB N="229" REF="243"/>
long Conversations, which these Subjects have
given Rise to in <HI>Clelia,</HI> and the <HI>Grand Cyrus,</HI>
where the most illustrious and greatest Personages
in the World manage the Disputes; and the
agreeable Diversity of their Sentiments on those
Heads affords a most pleasing and rational En∣tertainment:
You will there find, that the
greatest Conquerors, and Heroes of invincible
Valour, reason with the most exact and scru∣pulous
Nicety upon Love and Beauty; the Su∣periority
of fair and brown Hair controverted
by Warriors, with as much Eagerness as they
dispute for Victory in the Field; and the dif∣ferent
Effects of that Passion upon different
Hearts defined with the utmost Accuracy and
Eloquence.</P>
<P>I must own, interrupted Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> I
should have but a mean Opinion of those
Warriors, as you call them, who could busy
themselves in talking of such Trifles; and be
apt to imagine such insignificant Fellows, who
could wrangle about the Colour of their Mi∣stresses
Hair, would be the first to turn their
Backs upon the Enemy in Battle.</P>
<P>Is it possible, Sir, resumed <HI>Arabella,</HI> glow∣ing
with Indignation, that you can entertain
such unworthy Thoughts of Heroes, who merit
the Admiration and Praise of all Ages for
their inestimable Valour, whom the Spears of
a whole Army opposed to each of their single
Swords would not oblige to fly? What think
you, Sir, pursued she, looking at Sir <HI>George,</HI> of
the injurious Words my Uncle has uttered
against those heroic Princes, whose Courage, I
believe, you are as well acquainted with as my∣self?
<PB N="230" REF="244"/>
The great <HI>Oroondates,</HI> the invincible <HI>Ar∣taban,</HI>
the valiant and fortunate <HI>Artamenes,</HI> the
irresistible <HI>Juba,</HI> the incomparable <HI>Cleomedon,</HI>
and an hundred other Heroes I could name, are
all injured by this unjust Assertion of my Uncle;
since certainly they were not more famous for
their noble and wonderful Actions in War, than
for the Sublimity and Constancy of their Af∣fections
in Love.</P>
<P>Some of these Heroes you have named, re∣plied
Sir <HI>George,</HI> had the Misfortune, even in
their Lives, to be very cruelly vilified: The
great <HI>Oroondates</HI> was a long time accused of
Treachery to his Divine Princess; the valiant
and unfortunate <HI>Artamenes</HI> was suspected of
Inconstancy; and the irresistible <HI>Juba</HI> re∣proached
with Infidelity and Baseness, by both
his Mistress and Friend.</P>
<P>I never knew you was so well acquainted
with these Persons, interrupted Mr. <HI>Glanville;</HI>
and I fansy it is but very lately that you have
given yourself the Trouble to read Romances.</P>
<P>I am not of your Opinion, said <HI>Arabella.</HI>
Sir <HI>George,</HI> questionless, has appropriated great
Part of his Time to the Perusal of those Books,
so capable of improving him in all useful Know∣lege;
the Sublimity of Love, and the Quintes∣sence
of Valour; which Two Qualities, if pos∣sessed
in a superlative Degree, form a true and
perfect Hero, as the Perfection of Beauty, Wit,
and Virtue, make a Heroine worthy to be served
by such an illustrious Personage; and I dare
say, Sir <HI>George</HI> has profited so much by the
great Examples of Fidelity and Courage he has
placed before his Eyes, that no Consideration
<PB N="231" REF="245"/>
whatever could make him for one Moment
fail in his Constancy to the Divine Beauty he
adores; and, inspired by her Charms, he would
scorn to turn his Back, as my Uncle phrases it,
upon an Army of an hundred thousand Men.</P>
<P>I am extremely obliged to you, Madam, said
Sir <HI>George,</HI> bowing his Head to the Ground,
to hide a Smile he could not possibly restrain,
for the good Opinion you have of my Courage
and Fidelity.</P>
<P>As for Sir <HI>George</HI>'s Courage, Cousin, said
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> laughing, I never disputed it:
And though it be indeed a very extraordinary
Exertion of it, to fight singly against an Army
of an hundred thousand Men; yet since you are
pleased to think it probable, I am as willing to
believe Sir <HI>George</HI> may do it as any other Man;
but, as for his Fidelity in Matters of Love, I
greatly suspect it, since he has been charged
with some very flagrant Crimes of that Na∣ture.</P>
<P>How, Sir! resumed <HI>Arabella,</HI> Have you ever
been faithless then? and, after having sworn,
haply, to devote your whole Life to the Service
of some Beauty, have you ever violated your
Oaths, and been base enough to forsake her?</P>
<P>I have too much Complaisance, Madam,
said Sir <HI>George,</HI> to contradict Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI>
who has been pleased positively to assert, that
I have been faithless, as you most unkindly
phrase it.</P>
<P>Nay, Sir, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> this Accusation
is not of a Nature to be neglected; and though
a King should say it, I conceive, if you are
innocent, you have a Right to contradict him,
<PB N="232" REF="246"/>
and clear yourself: Do you consider how deeply
this Assertion wounds your Honour and Happi∣ness
for the future? What Lady, think you,
will receive your Services, loaded as you are
with the terrible Imputation of Inconstancy?</P>
<P>Oh! as for that, Madam, said Miss <HI>Glan∣ville,</HI>
I believe no Lady will think the worse
of Sir <HI>George</HI> for being faithless: For my
Part, I declare, nothing pleases me so much,
as gaining a Lover from another Lady; which
is a greater Compliment to one's Beauty, then
the Addresses of a Man that never was in Love
before—</P>
<P>You may remember, Cousin, replied <HI>Ara∣bella,</HI>
that I said once before, your Spirit and
Humour resembled a certain great Princess very
much; and I repeat it again, never was there
a greater Conformity in Tempers and Inclina∣tions.</P>
<P>My Daughter, said Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> is mightily
obliged to you, Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> for comparing her
to a great Princess: Undoubtedly you mean it
as a Compliment.</P>
<P>If you think, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> that barely com∣paring
her to a Princess be a Compliment, I
must take the Liberty to differ from you: My
Cousin is not so many Degrees below a Princess,
as that such a Comparison should be thought
extraordinary; for if her Ancestors did not
wear a Crown, they might, haply, have deserved
it; and her Beauty may one Day procure her
a Servant, whose Sword, like that of the great
<HI>Artaban,</HI> may win her a Sceptre; who, with a
noble Confidence, told his Princess, when the
Want of a Crown was objected to him, I wear
<PB N="233" REF="247"/>
a Sword, Madam, than can perform things
more difficult, that what you require; and if
a Crown be all that I want to make me worthy
of you, tell me what Kingdom in the World
you choose to reign in, and I will lay it at your
Feet.</P>
<P>That was a Promise, replied Sir <HI>George,</HI> fit
only for the great <HI>Artaban</HI> to make: But, Ma∣dam,
if you will permit me to make any Com∣parison
between that renowned Warrior and
myself, I would venture to tell you, that even
the great <HI>Artaban</HI> was not exempted from the
Character of Inconstancy any more than my∣self,
since, as you certainly know, he was in
Love with Three great Princesses successively.</P>
<P>I grant you, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> that <HI>Artaban</HI>
did wear the Chains of Three Princesses succes∣sively:
But it must also be remembred in his
Justification, that the Two First of these Beau∣ties
refused his Adorations, and treated him with
Contempt, because he was not a Prince: There∣fore,
recovering his Liberty, by those Disdains
they cast on him, he preserved that illustrious
Heart from Despair, to tender it with more
passionate Fidelity to the Divine Princess of the
<HI>Parthians;</HI> who, though greatly their Superior
in Quality and Beauty, did permit him to love
her. However, I must confess, I find some∣thing
like Levity in the Facility he found in
breaking his Fetters so often; and when I con∣sider,
that among all those great Heroes, whose
Histories I have read, none but himself ever
bore, without dying, the Cruelties he experi∣enced
from those Princesses, I am sometimes
tempted to accuse him myself of Inconstancy:
<PB N="234" REF="248"/>
But indeed every thing we read of that Prodigy
of Valour is wholly miraculous; and since the
Performance of Impossibilities was reserved for
him, I conclude this Miracle also, among many
others, was possible to him, whom nothing was
ever able to resist upon Earth. However, pur∣sued
she, rising, I shall not absolutely condemn
you, till I have heard your Adventures from
your own Mouth, at a convenient Time, when
I shall be able to judge how far you merit the
odious Appellation of Inconstancy.</P>
<P>Saying this, she saluted her Uncle, who had
for some time been conversing in a low Voice
with his Son, with a Grace wholly charming,
and retired to her Apartment. Miss <HI>Glanville</HI>
following her a few Moments after (the Com∣pliment,
extravagant as it was, which she had
paid her, having procured her some Good-will
from the vain and interested Miss <HI>Glanville</HI>),
they conversed together with a great deal of
good Humour till Dinner-time, which, be∣cause
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> was not absolutely reco∣vered,
was served in his Chamber.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which our Heroine is engaged in a new
Adventure.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> took a great deal of Pains
to turn the Discourse upon Subjects, on
which the charming <HI>Arabella</HI> could expatiate,
<PB N="235" REF="249"/>
without any Mixture of that Absurdity, which
mingled itself in a great many others; the rest
of that Day and several others, were passed
very agreeably: At the End of which, Mr.
<HI>Glanville</HI> being perfectly recovered, and able to
go abroad; the Baronet proposed to take the
Diversion of Hunting; which <HI>Arabella,</HI> who
was used to it, consented to partake of; but
being informed, that Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> could not
ride, and chose to stay at home, she would
have kept her Company, had not Sir <HI>Charles</HI>
insisted upon the contrary.</P>
<P>As Sir <HI>George,</HI> and some other Gentlemen,
had invited themselves to be of the Party; <HI>Ara∣bella,</HI>
on her coming down to mount her Horse,
found a great many young Gallants, ready to
offer her their Assistance upon this Occasion:
Accepting therefore, with great Politeness, this
Help from a Stranger, who was nearest her, she
mounted her Horse, giving Occasion to every
one that was present, to admire the Grace with
which she sat and managed him. Her Shape
being as perfect as any Shape could possibly be,
her Riding-habit discovered all its Beauties:
Her Hat, and the white Feather waving over
Part of her fine black Hair, gave a peculiar
Charm to her lovely Face: And she appeared
with so many Advantages in this Dress and
Posture, that Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> forgetting all her
Absurdities, was wholly lost in the Contempla∣tion
of so many Charms, as her whole Person
was adorned with.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George,</HI> though he really admired <HI>Arabella,</HI>
was not so passionately in Love as Mr. <HI>Glan∣ville;</HI>
and, being a keen Sportsman, eagerly pur∣sued
<PB N="236" REF="250"/>
the Game, with the rest of the Hunters;
but Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> minded nothing but his Cou∣sin,
and kept close by her.</P>
<P>After having rode a long time, <HI>Arabella,</HI> con∣ceiving
it a Piece of Cruelty, not to give her
Lover an Opportunity of talking to her, as, by
his extreme Solicitude, he seemed ardently to
desire, coming to a delightful Valley, she stop∣ped;
and told Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> that, being weary
of the Chace, she should alight, and repose
herself a little under the Shade of those Trees.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> extremely pleased at this
Proposition, dismounted; and, having helped
her to alight, seated himself by her on the
Grass.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> expecting he would begin to talk to
her of his Passion, could not help blushing at the
Thoughts of having given him such an Oppor∣tunity;
and Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> endeavouring to ac∣commodate
himself to her Ideas of a Lover,
expressed himself in Terms extravagant enough
to have made a reasonable Woman think he
was making a Jest of her: All which, how∣ever,
<HI>Arabella</HI> was extremely pleased with; and
she observed such a just Decorum in her An∣swers,
that, as the Writers of Romance phrase
it, if she did not give him any absolute Hopes
of being beloved, yet she said enough to make
him conclude she did not hate him.</P>
<P>They had conversed in this manner near a
Quarter of an Hour, when <HI>Arabella,</HI> perceiving
a Man at a little Distance, walking very com∣posedly,
shrieked out aloud; and, rising with the
utmost Precipitation, flew from Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI>
and went to untie her Horse; while his Asto∣nishment
<PB N="237" REF="251"/>
being so great at her Behaviour, that
he could not, for a Moment or two, ask her
the Cause of her Fear—</P>
<P>Do you not see, said she, out of Breath with
the Violence of her Apprehensions, the Person
who is coming towards us? It is the same,
who, some Months ago, attempted to carry me
away, when I was riding out with only Two
Attendants: I escaped, for that time, the Dan∣ger
that threatened me; but, questionless, he
comes now to renew his Attempts: Therefore
can you wonder at my Fear?</P>
<P>If it should be as you say, Madam, inter∣rupted
<HI>Glanville,</HI> What Reason have you to
fear? Do you not think I am able to defend
you?</P>
<P>Ah! without Doubt, you are able to de∣fend
me, answered she; and though, if you
offer to resist the Violence he comes to use
against me, he will, haply, call Two or Three
Dozen armed Men to his Assistance, who are,
I suppose, concealed hereabouts, yet I am
not apprehensive, that you will be worsted
by them: But as it happened to the brave <HI>Juba,</HI>
and <HI>Cleomedon,</HI> while they were fighting with
some hundred Men, who wanted to carry away
their Princesses before their Faces; and were
giving Death at every Blow, in order to pre∣serve
them; the Commander of these Ravish∣ers,
seeing the Two Princesses sitting, as I
was, under a Tree, ordered them to be
seized by Two of his Men, and carried away,
while the Two Princes were losing best Part of
of their Blood in their Defence; therefore,
to prevent such an Accident happening, while
<PB N="238" REF="252"/>
you are fighting for my Rescue, I think it will
be the safest Way for me to get on Horse∣back,
that I may be in a Condition to escape;
and that you may not employ your Valour to
no Purpose.</P>
<P>Saying this, having, with Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>'s
Assistance, loosed her Horse from the Tree, he
helped her to mount, and then remounted his
own.</P>
<P>Your Antagonist, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> is on Foot;
and therefore, though I prize your Life ex∣tremely,
yet I cannot dispense with myself
from telling you, that 'tis against the Laws of
Knighthood to take any Advantage of that
kind over your Enemy; nor will I permit your
Concern for my Safety to make you forget
what you owe to your own Reputation.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> fretting excessively at her
Folly, begged her not to make herself uneasy
about things that were never likely to hap∣pen.</P>
<P>The Gentleman yonder, added he, seems to
have no Designs to make any Attempt against
you: If he should, I shall know how to deal
with him: But, since he neither offers to assault
me, nor affront you, I think we ought not to
give him any Reason to imagine we suspect him,
by gazing on him thus; and letting him under∣stand
by your Manner, that he is the Subject of
our Conversation: If you please, Madam, we
will endeavour to join our Company.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> while he was speaking, kept her
Eyes fixed upon his Face, with Looks which
expressed her Thoughts were labouring upon
some very important Point: And, after a Pause
<PB N="239" REF="253"/>
of some Moments, Is it possible, said she, with
a Tone of extreme Surprize, that I should be
so mistaken in you? Do you really want Cou∣rage
enough to defend me against that Ra∣visher?</P>
<P>Oh Heavens! Madam, interrupted <HI>Glan∣ville,</HI>
try not my Temper thus: Courage
enough to defend you! 'Sdeath! you will make
me mad! Who, in the Name of Wonder, is
going to molest you?</P>
<P>He whom you see there, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI>
pointing to him with her Finger: For know,
cold and insensible as thou art to the Danger
which threatens me, yonder Knight is thy Ri∣val,
and a Rival, haply, who deserves my Esteem
better than thou dost; since, if he has Courage
enough to get me by Violence into his Power,
that same Courage would make him defend
me against any Injuries I might be offered from
another: And since nothing is so contempti∣ble
in the Eyes of a Woman, as a Lover who
wants Spirit to die in her Defence; know, I
can sooner pardon him, whom thou would
cowardly fly from, for the Violence which he
meditates against me, than thyself for the
Pusillanimity thou hast betrayed in my Sight.</P>
<P>With these Words, she galloped away from
her astonished Lover; who, not daring to follow
her, for fear of increasing her Suspicions of his
Cowardice, flung himself off his Horse in a vio∣lent
Rage; and, forgetting that the Stranger was
observing, and now within Hearing, he fell ac∣cusing
and exclaiming against the Books, that
had turned his Cousin's Brain; and railing at
his own ill Fate, that condemned him to the
<PB N="240" REF="254"/>
Punishment of loving her. Mr. <HI>Harvey</HI> (for it
really was he, whom an Affair of Consequence
had brought again into the Country), hearing
some of Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>'s last Words, and ob∣serving
the Gestures he used, concluded he
had been treated like himself by <HI>Arabella,</HI> whom
he knew again at a Distance: Therefore coming
up to Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> laughing—</P>
<P>Though I have not the Honour of knowing
you, Sir, said he, I must beg the Favour you
will inform me, if you are not disturbed at the
ridiculous Folly of the Lady I saw with you
just now? She is the most fantastical Creature
that ever lived, and, in my Opinion, fit for a
Mad-house: Pray, are you acquainted with
her?</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> being in a very ill Humour,
could not brook the Freedom of this Language
against his Cousin, whose Follies he could not
bear any one should rail at but himself; and, be∣ing
provoked at his Sneers, and the Interruption
he had given to their Conversation, he looked
upon him with a disdainful Frown, and told him
in an haughty Tone, That he was very imper∣tinent
to speak of a Lady of her Quality and
Merit so rudely.</P>
<P>Oh! Sir, I beg your Pardon, replied Mr.
<HI>Harvey,</HI> laughing more than before; What, I
suppose, you are the Champion of this fair Lady!
But, I assure myself, if you intend to quar∣rel
with every one that will laugh at her, you
will have more Business upon your Hands than
you can well manage.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> transported with Rage at this
Insolence, hit him such a Blow with the But-End
<PB N="241" REF="255"/>
of his Whip, that it stunned him for a
Moment; but recovering himself, he drew his
Sword, and, mad with the Affront he had re∣ceived,
made a Push at <HI>Glanville;</HI> who, avoiding
it with great Dexterity, had recourse to his
Hanger for his Defence.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> in the mean time, who had not rid
far, concealing herself behind some Trees, saw
all the Actions of her Lover, and intended
Ravisher; and, being possessed with an Opinion
of her Cousin's Cowardice, was extremely re∣joiced
to see him fall upon his Enemy first, and
that with so much Fury, that she had no longer
any Reason to doubt his Courage: Her Suspi∣cions,
therefore, being removed, her Tender∣ness
for him returned; and when she saw
them engaged with their Swords (for, at that
Distance, she did not plainly perceive the Dif∣ference
of their Weapons), her Apprehensions
for her Cousin were so strong, that, though she
did not doubt his Valour, she could not bear
to see him expose his Life for her: And, with∣out
making any Reflections upon the Singularity
of her Design, she was going to ride up to them,
and endeavour to part them; when she saw se∣veral
Men come towards them, whom she took
to be the Assistants of her Ravisher, though
they were, in reality, Haymakers; who, at a
Distance, having seen the Beginning of their
Quarrel, had hastened to part them.</P>
<P>Terrified, therefore, at this Reinforcement,
which she thought would expose her Cousin to
great Danger, she galloped, with all Speed,
after the Hunters, being directed by the Sound
of the Horn. Her Anxiety for her Cousin made
<PB N="242" REF="256"/>
her regardless of her own Danger, so that she
rode with a surprising Swiftness; and, overtaking
the Company, she would have spoken, to tell
them of her Cousin's Situation; when her
Spirits failing her, she could only make a Sign
with her Hand, and sunk down in a Swoon, in
the Arms of Sir <HI>George,</HI> who eagerly galloped
up to her; and, supporting her as well as he
was able till some others came to her Relief,
they took her off her Horse, and placed her
upon the Ground; when, by the Help of some
Water they brought from a Spring near them,
in a little time she came to herself.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> who, seeing her come up to them
without his Son, and by her fainting, concluded
some Misfortune had happened to him, the
Moment she opened her Eyes, asked her eagerly,
Where he was?</P>
<P>Your Son, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> sighing, is, with a
Valour equal to that of the brave <HI>Cleomedon,</HI>
this Moment fighting in my Defence against a
Croud of Enemies; and is, haply, shedding
the last Drop of his Blood in my Quarrel.</P>
<P>Shedding the last Drop of his Blood, <HI>haply!</HI>
interrupted Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> excessively grieved; and,
not a little enraged at <HI>Arabella,</HI> supposing she
had introduced him into some Quarrel, It may
be <HI>happy</HI> for you, Madam; but I am sure it
will make me very miserable, if my Son comes
to any Harm.</P>
<P>If it be the Will of Heaven he should fall in
this Combat, resumed <HI>Arabella,</HI> he can never
have a more glorious Destiny: And as that
Consideration will, doubtless, sweeten his last
Moments, so it ought to be your Consolation:
<PB N="243" REF="257"/>
However, I beg you'll lose no time, but haste
to his Assistance; for since he has a considerable
Number of Enemies to deal with, 'tis not im∣probable
but he may be overpowered at last.</P>
<P>Where did you leave my Son, Madam? cried
Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> eagerly.</P>
<P>He is not far off, replied <HI>Arabella:</HI> And you
will, doubtless, be directed to the Place, by the
Sight of the Blood of his Enemies, which he
has spilt. Go that way, pursued she, pointing
with her Finger towards the Place where she
had left her Cousin: There you will meet with
him, amidst a Croud of Foes, which he is sa∣crisicing
to my Safety, and his just Resentment.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> not knowing what to think, gal∣loped
away, followed by most Part of the Com∣pany;
Sir <HI>George</HI> telling Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> that he
would stay to defend her against any Attempts
that might be made on her Liberty, by any of
her Ravisher's Servants, who were, probably,
straggling about. <HI>Arabella,</HI> however, being
perfectly recovered, insisted upon following her
Uncle.</P>
<P>There is no Question, said she, but Mr.
<HI>Glanville</HI> is victorious: I am only apprehensive
for the dangerous Wounds he may have re∣ceived
in the Combat, which will require all
our Care and Assistance.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George,</HI> who wanted to engross her Com∣pany
a little to himself, in vain represented to
her, that, amidst the Horrors of a Fight so
bloody as that must certainly be, in which Mr.
<HI>Glanville</HI> and his Friends would be now en∣gaged,
it would be dangerous for her to venture
her Person: Yet she would not be persuaded;
<PB N="244" REF="258"/>
but, having mounted her Horse, with his As∣sistance,
she rode as fast as she was able after
the rest of the Company.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Being a Chapter of Mistakes.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>SIR <HI>Charles,</HI> who, by this Time, had got
to the Place she directed him to, but saw
no Appearance of fighting, and only a few
Haymakers in Discourse together, inquired, If
there had been any Quarrel between two Gentle∣men
in that Place?</P>
<P>One of them, at this Question, advancing,
told Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> that two Gentlemen had quar∣relled
there, and were fighting with Swords;
but that they had parted them; and that one of
them, having an Horse tied to a Tree, mounted
him, and rode away: That the other, they be∣lieved,
was not far off; and that there had
been no Bloodshed, they having come time
enough to prevent it.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles</HI> was extremely satisfied with this
Account; and, giving the Haymakers some
Money for the good Office they did in parting
the two Combatants, rode up to meet Lady
<HI>Bella;</HI> and informed her, that his Son was safe.</P>
<P>I cannot imagine he is safe, replied she, when
I see some of his Enemies (pointing to the Hay∣makers)
still alive: It is not customary, in those
Cases, to suffer any to escape: And, question∣less,
<PB N="245" REF="259"/>
my Cousin is either dead, or a Prisoner,
since all his Adversaries are not vanquished.</P>
<P>Why, you dream, Madam, replied Sir <HI>Charles:</HI>
Those Fellows yonder are Haymakers: What
should make them Enemies to my Son? They
were lucky enough to come in time to prevent
him and another Gentleman from doing each
other a Mischief. I cannot imagine for what
Reason my Son quarrelled with that Person they
speak of: Perhaps you can inform me.</P>
<P>Certainly, Sir, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> I can inform you,
since I was the Cause of their Quarrel. The
Story is too long to tell you now; and, besides,
it is so connected with the other Accidents of
my Life, that 'tis necessary you should be ac∣quainted
with my whole History, in order to
comprehend it: But, if those Persons are what
you say, and did really part my Cousin and his
Antagonist, truly I believe they have done him
a very ill Office: For, I am persuaded, my
Cousin will never be at Rest, till, by his Rival's
Death, he has freed himself from one, capable of
the most daring Enterprizes to get me into his
Power: And, since I cannot be in Security
while he lives, and persists in the Resolution he
has taken to persecute me, it had been better if
he had suffered all the Effects of my Cousin's
Resentment at that time, than to give him the
Trouble to hunt him through the World, in
order to sacrifice him to the Interest of his Love
and Vengeance.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> no less astonished than alarmed
at this Discovery of his Niece's sanguinary Sen∣timents,
told her, he was sorry to see a Lady so
far forget the Gentleness of her Sex, as to en∣courage
<PB N="246" REF="260"/>
and incite Men to such Extremities,
upon her Account. And, for the future, added
he, I must intreat you, Niece, to spare me the
Affliction of seeing my Son exposed to these
dangerous Quarrels: For, though his Life is so
little regarded by you, yet it is of the utmost
Consequence to me.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> who found Matter sufficient in the
Beginning of this Speech, to be offended with
her Uncle, yet, mistaking the latter Part of it
for a pathetic Complaint of her Cruelty, re∣plied
very gravely, That her Cousin's Safety
was not so indifferent to her as he imagined:
And that she did not hate him so much, but
that his Death would affect her very sensibly.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> in speaking these Words, blushed
with Shame, as thinking they were rather too
tender: And Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> who coloured like∣wise,
from a very different Motive, was open∣ing
his Mouth, to tell her, that he did not
think his Son was much obliged to her for not
hating him; when <HI>Arabella,</HI> supposing he de∣signed
to press her to a further Explanation of
the favourable Sentiments she felt for Mr.
<HI>Glanville,</HI> stopped him with Precipitation: Press
me no more, said she, upon this Subject: And,
as I have already spoken too much, haply, be∣fore
so many Witnesses, seek not to enhance
my Confusion, by prolonging to Discourse that
at present must needs be disagreeable to me.</P>
<P>I shall readily agree with you, Madam, re∣plied
Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> that you have spoken too
much: And, if I had thought you capable of
speaking in the manner you have done, I
<PB N="247" REF="261"/>
would have been more cautious in giving you
an Occasion for it.</P>
<P>I should imagine, Sir, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> blush∣ing
with Anger, as she before did with Shame,
that you would be the last Person in the World
who could think I had spoken too much upon
this Occasion: And, since you are pleased to
tell me so, I think it fit to let you know, that I
have not, in my Opinion, transgressed the
Laws of Decency and Decorum, in what I
have said in my Cousin's Favour: And I can
produce many Examples of greater Freedom of
Speech, in Princesses, and Ladies of the highest
Quality: However, I shall learn such a Lesson
of Moderation in this respect, from your Re∣proof,
that I promise you, neither yourself, or
Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> shall have any Cause, for the
future, to complain of my want of Discretion.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> who was very polite and good-natured,
was half angry with himself, for hav∣ing
obliged his Niece to such a Submission, as
he thought it; and, apologizing for the Rude∣ness
of his Reprehension, assured her, that he
was perfectly convinced of her Discretion in all
things; and did not doubt but her Conduct
would be always agreeable to him.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> who, from what her Uncle had
said, began to entertain Suspicions, that would
never have entered any Imagination but hers,
looked earnestly upon him for half a Moment,
as if she wished to penetrate into the most
secret Recesses of his Heart: But, fans<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing she
saw something in his Looks that confirmed her
Apprehensions, she removed her Eyes from his
Face, and, fastening them on the Ground, re∣mained
<PB N="248" REF="262"/>
for some Moments in Confusion.—Sir
<HI>Charles,</HI> whom her apparent Disturbance made
very uneasy, proposed returning to the Castle;
telling Lady <HI>Bella</HI> he expected to find his Son
already there.</P>
<P>'Tis more than probable, said she, turning to
Sir <HI>George,</HI> that my Cousin is gone in Pursuit
of my Ravisher; and the Interruption that has
been given to his designed Vengeance, making
him more furious than before, 'tis not likely he
will return till he has punished his Insolence by
that Death he so justly merits.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> is already so happy in your
Opinion, said Sir <HI>George,</HI> with a very profound
Sigh, that there is no need of his rendering you
this small Service, to increase your Esteem:
But, if my Prayers are heard, the Punishment
of your Ravisher will be reserved for a Person
less fortunate, indeed, than Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> tho'
not less devoted to your Interest, and concerned
in your Preservation.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George</HI> counterfeiting a Look of extreme
Confusion and Fear, as he ended these Words;</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> who perfectly comprehended the
Meaning they were designed to convey, thought
herself obliged to take no Notice of them: And,
therefore, without making any Reply to the
young Baronet, who ventured slowly to lift his
Eyes to her Face, in order to discover if there
were any Signs of Anger in it, she told Sir
<HI>Charles</HI> she inclined to go home: And Sir
<HI>George,</HI> with the rest of the Company, attended
them to the Castle; where, as soon as they ar∣rived,
they took their Leave.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="263"/>
Sir <HI>George,</HI> notwithstanding <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Care
to deprive him of an Opportunity of speaking
to her, told her, in a Whisper, having eagerly
alighted to help her off her Horse,</P>
<P>I am going, Madam, to find out that inso∣lent
Man, who has dared to offer Violence to
the fairest Person in the World: And, if I am
so happy as to meet with him, he shall either take
my Life, or I will put him into a Condition never
to commit any more Offences of that Nature.</P>
<P>Saying this, he made a low Bow; and, be∣ing
desirous to prevent her Answer, remounted
his Horse, and went away with the rest of the
Company.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> who, upon this Occasion, was to
be all Confusion, mixed with some little Re∣sentment,
discovered so much Emotion in her
Looks, while Sir <HI>George</HI> was whispering to her,
that her Uncle, as he was handing her into the
House, asked her, If she was offended at any
thing Sir <HI>George</HI> had said to her?</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> construing this Question as she had
done some other things her Uncle had said to
her, replied, in a reserved manner, Since my
Looks, contrary to my Intention, have betrayed
my Thoughts to you, I will not scruple to con∣fess,
that I have some Cause to be offended
with Sir <HI>George;</HI> and that, in two Instances
To-day, he has seemed to forget the Respect
he owes me.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles</HI> was fired at this Account: Is it
possible, said he, that Sir <HI>George</HI> has had the
Assurance to say any thing to offend you, and
that before my Face too? This Affront is not
to be borne.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="264"/>
I am sorry, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> eying him heed∣fully,
to see you so much concerned at it.</P>
<P>Don't be uneasy, interrupted Sir <HI>Charles:</HI>
There will be no bad Consequences happen from
it: But he shall hear of it, added he, raising
his Voice with Passion: I'll force him this Night
to explain himself.</P>
<P>You must pardon me, Sir, said <HI>Arabella,</HI>
more and more confirmed in her Notions, if I
tell you, that I am extremely offended at your
uncommon Zeal upon this Occasion: And also
I must assure you, that a little more Calmness
would be less liable to Suspicion.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> coming to meet them, Sir
<HI>Charles,</HI> who did not take much Notice of
what <HI>Arabella</HI> said, eagerly inquired for his
Son; and, hearing he was not come home, was
apprehensive of his meeting again with the Per∣son
he had quarrelled with: But his Fears did
not last long; for Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> came in, hav∣ing
purposely avoided the Company, to hide the
Uneasiness Lady <HI>Bella</HI>'s tormenting Folly had
given him.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which the Mistakes are continued.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS soon as Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> appeared, the two
Ladies retired; Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> asking
<HI>Arabella</HI> a hundred Questions concerning their
Diversion, the Drift of which was, to know
how Sir <HI>George</HI> behaved to her: But that fair
<PB N="251" REF="265"/>
Lady, whose Thoughts were wholly employed
on the strange Accidents which had happened to
her that Day, longed to be at Liberty to indulge
her Reflections; and, complaining of extreme
Weariness, under Pretence of reposing herself
till Dinner, got quit of Miss <HI>Glanville</HI>'s Com∣pany,
which, at that time, she thought very
tedious.</P>
<P>As soon as she was left to herself, her Imagi∣nation
running over all that had happened, she
could not help confessing, that few Women ever
met with such a Variety of Adventures in one
Day: In Danger of being carried off by Vio∣lence,
by one Lover; delivered by another;
Insinuations of Love from a Third, who, she
thought, was enamoured of her Cousin; and,
what was still more surprising a Discovery, that
her Uncle was not insensible of her Charms,
but was become the Rival of his own Son.</P>
<P>As extravagant as this Notion was, <HI>Arabella</HI>
found Precedents in her Romances of Passions
full as strange and unjustifiable; and confirmed
herself in that Opinion, by recollecting several
Examples of unlawful Love. Why should I
not believe, said she, that my Charms can
work as powerful Effects as those of <HI>Olympia,</HI>
Princess of <HI>Thrace,</HI> whose Brother was passion∣ately
enamoured of her?</P>
<P>Did not the Divine <HI>Clelia</HI> inspire <HI>Maherbal</HI>
with a violent Passion for her, who, though
discovered to be her Brother, did not, never∣theless,
cease to adore her? And, to bring an
Instance still nearer to my own Case, was not
the Uncle of the fair <HI>Alcyone</HI> in Love with her?
<PB N="252" REF="266"/>
And did he not endeavour to win her Heart by
all the Methods in his Power?</P>
<P>Ah! then, pursued she, let us doubt no
more of our Misfortune: And, since our fatal
Beauty has raised this impious Flame, let us
stifle it with our Rigour, and not allow an ill∣timed
Pity, or Respect, to encourage a Passion
which may, one Day, cast a Blemish upon our
Glory.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> having settled this Point, proceed∣ed
to reflect on the Conquest she had made of
Sir <HI>George:</HI> She examined his Words over and
over, and found them so exactly conformable to
the Language of an <HI>Oroondates</HI> or <HI>Oronces,</HI> that
she could not choose but be pleased: But, recol∣lecting
that it behoved her, like all other He∣roines,
to be extremely troubled and perplexed
at an Insinuation of Love, she began to lament
the cruel Necessity of parting with an agreeable
Friend; who, if he persisted in making her
acquainted with his Thoughts, would expofe
himself to the Treatment Persons so indiscreet
always meet with; nor was she less concerned,
lest, if Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> had not already dispatched
her Ravisher, Sir <HI>George,</HI> by wandering in
Search of him, and, haply, sacrificing him to
his eager Desire of serving her, should, by that
means, lay her under an Obligation to him,
which, considering him as a Lover, would be a
great Mortification.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George,</HI> however, was gone home to his
own House, with no Thoughts of pursuing
<HI>Arabella</HI>'s Ravisher: And Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> being
questioned by his Father concerning his Quar∣rel,
invented some trifling Excuse for it; which
<PB N="253" REF="267"/>
not agreeing with the Account the Baronet had
received from <HI>Arabella,</HI> he told his Son, that
he had concealed the Truth from him; and that
there was more in that Affair than he had
owned. You quarrelled, added he, upon <HI>Ara∣bella</HI>'s
Account; and she did not scruple to af∣firm
it before all the Company.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who had vainly flattered him∣self
with an Hope, that his Cousin had not ac∣quainted
the Company with her whimsical Ap∣prehensions,
was extremely vexed when he
found she had exposed herself to their Ridicule,
and that it was probable even he had not escaped:
But, willing to know from her own Mouth how
far she had carried her Folly, he went up to
her Chamber; and, being immediately admit∣ted,
she began to congratulate him upon the
Conquest he had gained, as she supposed, over
his Enemy; and thanked him very solemnly for
the Security he had procured for her.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> after assuring her, that she was
in no Danger of ever being carried away by that
Person whom she feared, proceeded to inquire
into all that had passed between her and the
Company whom she had joined, when she left
him; and <HI>Arabella,</HI> relating every Particular,
gave him the Mortification to know, that her
Folly had been sufficiently exposed: But she
touched upon her Fears for him with so much
Delicacy, and mentioned her Fainting in such
a manner, as insinuated a much greater Tender∣ness
than he before had Reason to hope for;
and this Knowlege destroying all his Intentions
to quarrel with her for what she had said, he
appeared so easy and satisfied, that <HI>Arabella,</HI>
<PB N="254" REF="268"/>
reflecting upon the Misfortune his Father's new∣born
Passion would probably be the Occasion of
to him, could not help sighing at the Appre∣hension;
looking on him, at the same time,
with a kind of pitying Complacency; which
did not escape Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>'s Notice.</P>
<P>I must know the Reason of that Sigh, Cousin,
said he, smiling, and taking her Hand.</P>
<P>If you are wise, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> gravely,
you will be contented to remain in the pleasing
Ignorance you are at present; and not seek to
know a thing which will, haply, afford you but
little Satisfaction.</P>
<P>You have increased my Curosity so much
by this Advice, resumed he, accommodating
his Looks to <HI>Arabella</HI>'s, that I shall not be at
Rest till I know what it is you conceal from
me: And, since I am so much concerned in it,
even by your own Confession, I have a Right
to press you to explain yourself.</P>
<P>Since you are so importunate, replied <HI>Ara∣bella,</HI>
I mnst tell you, that I will not do you
so great a Diskindness, as to explain myself;
nor will I be the first who shall acquaint you
with your Misfortune, since you will, haply,
too soon arrive at the Knowlege of it, by other
means.</P>
<P><HI>Glanville,</HI> who imagined this was some new
Whim that had got into her Head, was but
little perplexed at an Insinuation, which, had
he been ignorant of her Foible, would have
given him great Uneasiness: But, being sensible
that she expected he would press her to disclose
herself, and appear extremely concerned at her
refusing him that Satisfaction, he counterfeited
<PB N="255" REF="269"/>
so well, that she was at a loss how to evade the
Arguments he used to make her unfold the
terrible Mystery; when the Dinner-bell ringing,
and relieving her sor the present, Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>
led her down to the Parlour; where Sir <HI>Charles</HI>
and his Daughter attended their coming.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which the Mistakes are not yet cleared up.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Baronet, who had been put into a
bad Humour by <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Insinuations,
that Sir <HI>George</HI> had affronted her, appeared re∣served
and uneasy; and, being resolved to
question her about it, was willing first to know
exactly what it was his Niece had been offended
at: But as he feared, if it came to his Son's
Knowlege, it would produce a Quarrel between
the young Gentlemen, that might have dan∣gerous
Consequences, he was desirous of speak∣ing
to her alone; and, as soon as Dinner was
over, asked her to take a Walk with him upon
the Terrace, telling her he had something to
say to her in private. <HI>Arabella,</HI> whose Fears
had been considerably increased by the Pensive∣ness
which appeared in her Uncle's Looks du∣ring
Dinner, and supposing he wanted a pri∣vate
Conversation, only to explain himself more
clearly to her, than he had yet done, was ex∣cessively
alarmed at this Request; and, casting
her Eyes down to the Ground, blushed in such
<PB N="256" REF="270"/>
a manner as betrayed her Confusion; and made
Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> and her Brother believe, that she
suspected her Uncle had a Design to press her
soon to give her Hand to Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> which
occasioned her apparent Disorder.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> however, who had not so heed∣fully
observed her Behaviour, repeated his Re∣quest;
adding, with a Smile, upon her giving
him no Answer, Sure, Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> you are
not afraid to be alone with your Uncle.</P>
<P>No, Sir, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> giving him a
piercing Look; I am not afraid of being alone
with my Uncle; and, as long as he pretends to
be no more than my Uncle, I shall not scruple to
hear what he has to say to me.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> a little vexed at an Answer which
insinuated, as he thought, a Complaint of his
having pretended to more Authority over her
than he ought, told her, he hoped she had no
Cause to believe he would displease her, by any
improper Exertion of that Power over her, with
which her Father had intrusted him: For I assure
you, added he, I would rather you should follow
my Advice as an Uncle, than obey me as a Guar∣dian;
and, since my Affection for you is, pre∣haps,
greater than what many People have for
a Niece, my Solicitude ought to be imputed to
that Motive.</P>
<P>I have all the Sense I ought to have of that
Affection you honour me with, replied <HI>Ara∣bella;</HI>
and since I hope it will be always what
it should be, without wishing for its Increase, I
am contented with those Testimonies I have
already received of it; and do not desire any
other.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="271"/>
Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> a little puzzled to understand the
Meaning of these Words, which the grave
Looks of <HI>Arabella</HI> made yet more mysterious,
rose from his Seat with an Air of Discontent: I
should have been glad to have spoken a Word in
private to you, Niece, said she; but, since you
think proper to make so much Ceremony in such
a Trifle, I'll defer it till you are in a better Hu∣mour.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Glanville,</HI> seeing her Father going out
of the Room, stepped before him: Nay, Papa,
said she, if you want to speak with my Cousin,
my Brother and I will go out, and leave you to
yourselves.</P>
<P>You will do me a very great Displeasure, said
<HI>Arabella;</HI> for, I am sure, my Uncle has not
any thing of Consequence to say to me: How∣exer,
added she, seeing Miss <HI>Glanville</HI> go away,
I am resolved, I will not be left alone; and
therefore, Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> since I can pretend to
some Power over you, I command you to stay.</P>
<P>You may remember, Madam, said Mr. <HI>Glan∣ville,</HI>
with a Smile, you refused to gratify my
Curiosity, with regard to something you hinted
to me some time ago; and, to punish you, added
he, going out of the Room, I am resolved you
shall listen to what my Father has to say to you;
for, by your Unwillingness to hear it, I ima∣gine
you suspect already what it is.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> finding she had no way to avoid
hearing what she dreaded so much, and observ∣ing
her Uncle had resumed his Chair, pre∣pared
to give him Audience; but, in order to
deprive him of all Hope, that she would receive
his Discourse favourably, she assumed the se∣verest
<PB N="258" REF="272"/>
Look she was capable of; and, casting
her Eyes on the Ground, with a Mixture of
Anger and Shame, waited with a kind of Fear
and Impatience for what he had to say.</P>
<P>I see, Madam, said the Baronet, observing
her Confusion, that you apprehend what I am
going to say to you; but, I beseech you, do not
fear I have any Intentions, but such as you'll
approve.</P>
<P>You are certainly in the right, Sir, said <HI>Ara∣bella,</HI>
in the Interpretation you have put on my
Looks: I am really in Pain about the Purport
of your Discourse: And you would particu∣larly
oblige me, if you would dispense with me
from hearing it.</P>
<P>I see, replied Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> that, out of a mis∣taken
Fear, you are unwilling to hear me, in
order to avoid coming to the Explanation I de∣sire:
But I tell you, once again, you have no∣thing
to apprehend.</P>
<P>I have every thing to apprehend, Sir, resumed
<HI>Arabella,</HI> tartly, while you persist in your De∣sign
of disobliging me; and you cannot give me
a greater Proof of the Badness of your Inten∣tions,
than by thus forcing me to listen to Dis∣courses
I ought to avoid.</P>
<P>Since my Word has no Weight with you,
replied Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> I'll condescend to assure you,
by the most sacred Oath, That I do not mean
to come to any Extremities with Sir <HI>George,</HI>
concerning what you already told me: All I
desire to know is, If you think you had any Rea∣son
to be offended with him for any thing he
said? And, in that Case, I cannot dispense with
myself from expostulating with him about it.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="273"/>
You would do me a Favour, Sir, resumed
<HI>Arabella,</HI> if you would interest yourself a little
less in what Sir <HI>George</HI> said to me: The Of∣fence
was committed against me only; and none
but myself has any Right to resent it.</P>
<P>'Tis enough, Niece, said Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> rising:
You acknowlege sufficient to make me resolve
to oblige him to ask Pardon for the Affront you
have received: However, I beg you may make
yourself easy; no ill Consequences will happen
from this Affair, provided my Son does not
know it: And I know you have too much Dis∣cretion
to acquaint him with it.</P>
<P>Saying this, he went out of the Room, leav∣ing
<HI>Arabella</HI> in great Consusion at what he had
said; which, in her Opinion, had amounted
almost to a plain Declaration of his Passion; and
his Design of putting an End to Sir <HI>George</HI>'s
Pretensions, whom, it was probable, he looked
upon as a more dangerous Rival than his Son,
confirmed her in the Opinion of his Resolution
to persecute her.</P>
<P>Full of the Reflections this Accident had oc∣casioned,
she went to walk in the Garden,
where Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> his Sister having just left
him, joined her.</P>
<P>As he imagined, his Father's Design, in
speaking to her alone, was to prevail upon her
to consent to marry him before she left the Coun∣try,
which was what he most earnestly wished,
he drew a bad Omen from the Discontent which
appeared in her Eyes.</P>
<P>Is it with me, Cousin, said he, or with what
my Father has been saying to you, that you are
angry?</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="274"/>
With both, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> hastily; for if
you had staid in the Room, as I commanded you,
I should not have been exposed to the Pain of
hearing Things so disagreeable.</P>
<P>Since I knew what would be the Purport of
my Father's Discourse, said Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> you
ought not to be surprised I could not resolve to
give any Interruption to it, by my Presence:
And, being so much interested in the Success
of his Solicitations, I could not choose but give
him an Opportunity of speaking to you alone,
as he desired.</P>
<P>It seems then, resumed <HI>Arabella,</HI> you know
what was the Subject of his Conversation.</P>
<P>I believe I can guess, interrupted Mr. <HI>Glan∣ville,</HI>
smiling.</P>
<P>Is it possible, cried <HI>Arabella,</HI> starting back in
great Surprize, that, knowing, as you say you
do, your Father's Intentions, you would re∣solve
to furnish him with an Opportunity of
disclosing them?</P>
<P>Can you blame me, said Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> for
suffering him to undertake what I durst not my∣self?
I know your Delicacy, or rather your Se∣verity,
so well, that I am sensible, if I had
taken the Liberty to say what my Father has
said, you would have been extremely offended;
and punished me, as you have often done, with
a Banishment from your Presence: Nay, pur∣sued
he, seeing Astonishment and Anger in her
Countenance, I perceive you are, at this Mo∣ment,
going to pronounce some terrible Sen∣tence
against me.</P>
<P>You are deceived, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> with a
forced Calmness; I am so far from being of∣fended
<PB N="261" REF="275"/>
with you, that I am ready to acknow∣lege,
you merit very extraordinary Praises for
the perfect Resignation you shew to the Will,
and, for your Credit, I will suppose, the Com∣mands,
of your Father: But I would advise you
to be contented with the Reputation of being a
dutiful Son; and, for the future, never aspire
to that of being a faithful Lover.</P>
<P>Speaking these Words, which were wholly
unintelligible to her amazed Admirer, she left
him, and went to her own Apartment, strangely
surprised at the Indifference of Mr. <HI>Glanville;</HI>
who, as she understood what he had said, was
not only willing to resign her to his Father,
but also took upon him to mediate in his be∣half.</P>
<P>As she was unwilling to acknowlege, even to
herself, that the Grief she felt at this Discovery,
proceeded from any Affection for her Cousin,
she imputed it to the Shame of seeing herself so
basely forsaken and neglected; and, not being
able to find a Precedent for such an Indignity
offered to the Charms of any Lady in her Ro∣mances,
the Singularity of her Fate, in this
respect, seemed to demand all her Uneasi∣ness.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Which contains some necessary Consequences
of the foregoing Mistakes.—A Soliloquy
on a Love-Letter.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHILE <HI>Arabella</HI> passed her Time in
her Closet, in the most disagreeable
Reflections, <HI>Glanville</HI> was racking his Brain to
find out the Meaning of those mysterious Words
she had uttered at leaving him: He examined
them twenty times over, but could not possi∣bly
penetrate into their Sense: But, supposing
at last, that they really meant nothing at all,
or were occasioned by some new Flight of her
Imagination, he went to find out his Father,
in order to know what had passed between
him and <HI>Arabella.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> however, was not to be found; he
had ordered his Horse to be made ready, under
Pretence of taking a little Ride after Dinner;
and, passing by Sir <HI>George</HI>'s House, alighted to
pay him a Visit.</P>
<P>The young Baronet, being at home, received
him with great Politeness: And Sir <HI>Charles,</HI>
whose peculiar Disposition was, to be nicely te∣nacious
of every thing which, he imagined,
had any Relation to the Honour of his Family,
took the first Opportunity to question him, con∣cerning
the Confusion his Whisper had occa∣sioned
in Lady <HI>Bella;</HI> adding, That she had
confessed, he had given her Reason to take ill
what he had said to her.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="277"/>
Sir <HI>George,</HI> who was by no means willing to
quarrel with the Uncle of <HI>Arabella,</HI> received the
old Gentleman's Remonstrances with a great
deal of Calmness; and, finding <HI>Arabella</HI> had
not discovered the Purport of that Whisper
which had offended her, he told Sir <HI>Charles,</HI>
That the Confusion he saw in her Countenance,
was occasioned by his raillying her upon the
Fright she had been in upon Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>'s
Account: He added some Particulars to this
Account, that intirely taking away all Incli∣nation
in Sir <HI>Charles</HI> to pursue the Matter any
farther, they parted upon very good Terms;
Sir <HI>George</HI> promising, very soon, to return his
Visit at the Castle.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> upon his Father's Return, be∣ing
impatient to know what he had said to <HI>Ara∣bella,</HI>
inquired with so much Precipitation, con∣cerning
the Conversation they had had together,
that Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> unwilling to tell him the Truth,
and not having time to consider of an Answer,
evaded his Question in such a manner, that Mr.
<HI>Glanville</HI> could not help making some Obser∣vation
upon it; and, comparing this Circum∣stance
with what <HI>Arabella</HI> had said, tho' he
could not comprehend the Meaning that seemed
to be concealed under their Behaviour, he im∣mediately
concluded, there was some Mystery,
which it concerned him to find out.</P>
<P>Possessed with this Opinion, he longed for
an Opportunity to talk with <HI>Arabella</HI> alone;
but he was not so happy to obtain one; for,
tho' that Fair-one presided at the Tea-table, as
usual, and also appeared at Supper, yet she so
industriously avoided all Occasions of being alone
<PB N="264" REF="278"/>
with him, tho' but for a Moment, and ap∣peared
so reserved and uneasy, that it was im∣possible
for him to speak to her upon that Sub∣ject.</P>
<P>As soon as it was time to retire, having re∣solved
to request the Favour of a few Moments
Conversation with her, in her own Apartment;
and when he had, as was his Custom, handed
her up Stairs; instead of wishing her a good
Night, at her Chamber-door, he was going
to desire Permission to enter it with her; when
<HI>Lucy,</HI> coming to meet her Lady, whispered her
in the Ear; upon which, <HI>Arabella,</HI> turning
towards him, gave him an hasty Salute, and
hurried into her Apartment.</P>
<P><HI>Glanville,</HI> no less vexed at this Disappoint∣ment,
than perplexed at that Whisper, which
had caused such a visible Emotion in <HI>Arabella,</HI>
retired to his own Room, tormented with a thou∣sand
uneasy Suspicions, for which he could not
exactly assign a Cause; and wishing impatiently
for the next Day, in which he hoped to pro∣cure
some Explanation of what at present greatly
perplexed him.</P>
<P>In the mean time, <HI>Arabella,</HI> who had been
informed by <HI>Lucy,</HI> in that Whisper, who was
eager to let her know it, that a Messenger had
brought a Letter from Sir <HI>George,</HI> and, late as
it was at Night, waited for an Answer, was de∣bating
with herself, whether she should open
this Billet or not: She had a strong Inclination
to see what it contained; but, fearful of trans∣gressing
the Laws of Romance, by indulging a
Curiosity not justifiable by Example, she re∣solved
to return this Letter unopened.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="279"/>
Here, said she to <HI>Lucy,</HI> give this Letter to the
Messenger that brought it, and tell him, I was
excessively offended with you, for receiving it
from his Hands.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy,</HI> taking the Letter, was going to obey
her Orders; when, recollecting herself, she bid
her stay.</P>
<P>Since Sir <HI>George,</HI> said she to herself, is no
declared Lover of mine, I may, without any
Offence to Decorum, see what this Letter con∣tains:
To refuse receiving it, will be to acknow∣lege,
that his Sentiments are not unknown to
me; and, by consequence, to lay myself under a
Necessity of banishing him: Nor is it fit, that I
should allow him to believe, I am so ready to
apprehend the Meaning of every gallant Speech,
which is used to me; and to construe such In∣sinuations,
as he took the Liberty to make me,
into Declarations of Love.</P>
<P>Allowing, therefore, the Justice of these Rea∣sons,
she took the Letter out of <HI>Lucy</HI>'s Hand;
and, being upon the Point of opening it, a sud∣den
Thought controuled her Designs: She threw
it suddenly upon her Toilet; and, looking very
earnestly upon it,</P>
<P>Presumptuous Paper! said she, speaking with
great Emotion to the Letter: Bold Repository
of thy Master's daring Thoughts! Shall I not
be blamed by all, who hereafter will hear, or
read, my History, if, contrary to the Appre∣hensions
I have, that thou containest a Confes∣sion
that will displease me, I open thy Seal,
and become accessary to thy Writer's Guilt,
by deigning to make myself acquainted with it?
And thou, too indiscreet and unwary Friend,
<PB N="266" REF="280"/>
whose Folds contain the Acknowlegement of
his Crime! What will it advantage thee or
him, if, torn by my resenting Hand, I make
thee suffer, for the Part thou bearest in thy
Master's Fault; and teach him, by thy Fate,
how little Kindness he has to expect from me!
Yet, to spare myself the Trouble of reading
what will, questionless, greatly displease me, I
will return thee, uninjured, into thy Master's
Hands; and, by that Moderation, make him
repent the Presumption he has been guilty of!</P>

<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Containing a Love-Letter in the Heroic
Stile; with some occasional Reasonings
by Lucy, full of Wit and Simplicity.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>OUR fair Heroine, having ended the fore∣going
Soliloquy, took up the Letter, and
gave it to <HI>Lucy,</HI> who had, all the time she was
speaking, observed a profound Silence, mixed
with a most eager Attention.</P>
<P>Here, pursued she, carry it to the Person who
brought it; and bid him tell his Master, that,
lest I should find any thing in it, which may
offend me, I have chosen not to read it: And,
if he is wise, he will profit by my Concern for
him, and take care how he hazards displeasing
me a Second time by an Importunity of this
kind, which I shall not so easily pardon him.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy,</HI> who had taken particular Notice of
this Speech, in order to remember every Word
<PB N="267" REF="281"/>
of it, when she repeated it again, went conning
her Lesson to the Place where she had desired
the Servant to wait her coming: But he was
gone; such being indeed his Master's Orders;
for he was apprehensive, that, following the
Custom of the Ladies in Romances, <HI>Arabella</HI>
would return his Letter; and therefore, to de∣prive
her of an Opportunity of sending it back
that Night, he ordered his Man to say, he
waited for an Answer; but, as soon as he con∣veniently
could, to come away without one.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy,</HI> in a great Surprize at the Servant's go∣ing
away, returned to her Lady with the Letter
in her Hand, telling her she must needs read it
now, since the Person, who brought it, was
gone.</P>
<P>It must be confessed, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> taking
the Letter from her, with a Smile, he has fallen
upon an ingenious Device, to make me keep it
for this Night; and, since, haply, I may be
mistaken in the Contents, I have a mind to
open it.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy</HI> did not fail to confirm her Lady in this
Design: And <HI>Arabella,</HI> making as if she yielded
to the Importunities of her Confidante, opened
the Letter; which she found as follows:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>The unfortunate and despairing Bellmour, to
the Divine Arabella.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE it is, doubtless, not only with your
Permission, but even by your Commands,
that your Uncle, Sir <HI>Charles Glanville,</HI> comes
to pronounce the Sentence of my Death, in the
<PB N="268" REF="282"/>
Denunciation of your Anger, I submit, Madam,
without repining at the Rigour of that Doom
you have inflicted on me. Yes, Madam, this
Criminal, who has dared to adore you, with
the most sublime and perfect Passion that ever
was, acknowleges the Justice of his Punishment;
and, since it is impossible to cease loving you,
or to live without telling you he does so, he is
going, voluntarily, to run upon that Death your
Severity makes him wish for, and the Great∣ness
of his Crime demands. Let my Death
then, O Divine <HI>Arabella,</HI> expiate the Offence
I have been guilty of! And let me hope those
fair Eyes, that have beheld me with Scorn
when alive, will not refuse to shed some Tears
upon my Tomb! And that, when you remem∣ber
my Crime of loving you, you will also be
pleased to remember, that I died for that Crime;
and wish for no other Comfort in Death, but
the Hope of your not hating, when he is no
more,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>The unhappy <HI>Bellmour.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> who had read this Letter aloud,
sighed gently at the Conclusion of it; but poor
<HI>Lucy,</HI> who was greatly affected at so dolorous
an Epistle, could not restrain her Tears; but
sobbed so often, and with so much Violence,
as, at length, recalled her Lady from the Re∣verie,
into which she was plunged.</P>
<P>What ails you? said she to her Confidante,
greatly surprised: What is the Cause of this un∣seemly
Sorrow?</P>
<P>Oh! Madam! cried <HI>Lucy,</HI> her Sobs making
a frequent and unpleasing Interruption in her
<PB N="269" REF="283"/>
Words; I shall break my Heart to be sure: Ne∣ver
was such a sad mournful Letter in the
World: I could cry my Eyes out for the poor
Gentleman. Pray excuse me, Madam; but,
indeed, I can't help saying, You are the most
hard-heartedest Lady I ever knew in my born
Days: Why, to be sure, you don't care, if
an hundred fine Gentlemen should die for you,
tho' their Spirits were to haunt you every Night!
Well! I would not have what your Ladyship
has to answer for, for all the World!</P>
<P>You are a foolish Wench! replied <HI>Arabella,</HI>
smiling at her Simplicity: Do you think I have
any Cause to accuse myself, tho' Five thousand
Men were to die for me? 'Tis very certain, my
Beauty has produced very deplorable Effects:
The unhappy <HI>Hervey</HI> has expiated, by his
Death, the Violence his too desperate Passion
forced him to meditate against me: The no less
guilty, the noble Unknown, <HI>Edward,</HI> is wander∣ing
about the World, in a tormenting Despair;
and stands exposed to the Vengeance of my
Cousin, who has vowed his Death. My Charms
have made another Person, whose Character
ought to be sacred to me, forget all the Ties
of Consanguinity; and become the Rival of his
Son, whose Interest he once endeavoured to
support: And, lastly, the unfortunate <HI>Bell∣mour</HI>
consumes away in an hopeless Passion;
and, conscious of his Crime, dooms himself,
haply, with more Severity than I desire, to a
voluntary Death; in hopes, thereby, of pro∣curing
my Pardon and Compassion, when he is
no more. All these, <HI>Lucy,</HI> as I said before,
are very deplorable Effects of my Beauty; but
<PB N="270" REF="284"/>
you must observe, that my Will has no Part
in the Miseries, that unfortunate Beauty occa∣sions;
and that, tho' I could even wish myself
less fair, in order to avoid giving so much Un∣happiness
to others, yet these Wishes would
not avail; and since, by a fatal Necessity, all
these Things will happen, whether I would or
no, I must comfort myself under the Uneasi∣ness,
which the Sensibility of my Temper
makes me feel, by the Reflection, that, with my
own Consent, I contribute nothing to the Mis∣fortune
of those who love me.</P>
<P>Will your Ladyship then let poor Sir <HI>George</HI>
die? said <HI>Lucy,</HI> who had listened very atten∣tively
to this fine Harangue, without under∣standing
what it meant.</P>
<P>Questionless, he must die, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI>
if he persists in his Design of loving me.</P>
<P>But, pray, Madam, resumed <HI>Lucy,</HI> cannot
your Ladyship command him to live, as you
did Mr. <HI>Hervey,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who both
did as you bid them?</P>
<P>I may command him to live, said <HI>Ara∣bella;</HI>
and there is no Question but he would
obey me, if I likewise permit him to love me;
but, this last not being fit for me to do, I see
no way to prevent the sad Resolution he has
taken.</P>
<P>To be sure, Madam, returned <HI>Lucy,</HI> your
Ladyship knows what you ought to do bet∣ter
than I can advise your Ladyship, being that
you are more learned than me: But, for all
that I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it's better to save Life than to kill,
as the Bible-Book says; and, since I am sure
your Ladyship is a good Christian, if the Gen∣tleman
<PB N="271" REF="285"/>
dies for the Want of a few kind Words,
or so, I am sure you will be troubled in Mind
about it.</P>
<P>It must be confessed, said <HI>Arabella,</HI> smiling,
that, tho' your Solicitations are not very elo∣quent,
they are very earnest and affecting; and
I promise you, I will think about it; and, if I
can persuade myself, I am doing no wrong
Thing, by concerning myself about his Preser∣vation,
I will dispatch you To-morrow Morn∣ing,
with my Orders to him, to live, or, at
least, to proceed no further in his Design of dy∣ing,
till he has further Cause.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy,</HI> being extremely glad she had gained
her Point, called in her Lady's other Women,
who, having assisted her to undress, left her in
her Closet, to which she always retired for an
Hour, before she went to Bed.</P>
