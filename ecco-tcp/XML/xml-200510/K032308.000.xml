truly doing an Honour to the <HI>Bri∣tish</HI> Service; And how much is it to be desir'd, that so Bright an Exam∣ple, may be Imitated by other Gen∣tlemen of the best Families, and For∣tunes.</P>
<P>We have scarce an Instance in <HI>An∣tient,</HI> or <HI>Modern History,</HI> of any Hero who has <HI>Commanded</HI> WELL, with∣out having first learn'd what it was to OBEY.

<P>Oh! — that's too long a Story at present.</P>

<P>What Game are you in Pursuit of?</P>

<P>The <HI>old standing Dish,</HI> a WIFE! Here's no Hopes of <HI>War,</HI> no <HI>Rising</HI> in View! and <HI>Subaltern</HI>'s Pay will make a Man <HI>rub but slowly through the World.</HI> I have got Leave of my Colonel to be absent from my Post for Two Months, in which Time, <HI>I intend to make my Fortune.</HI> —You know the Widow <HI>Head∣less</HI>!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well! Ha! —is not that <HI>her Livery?</HI></P>

<P>Yes, faith, I march in the Number of her <HI>Retinue.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>To what End?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fain.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's uncertain. If you know the <HI>Widow,</HI> you are no Stranger to <HI>her Taste</HI> in <HI>Servants.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know she keeps none but <HI>awkard Coun∣try Things.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fain.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay! and is a perfect <HI>Jockey</HI> in her Family, and takes as much Pains to polish her <HI>Train,</HI> as they do to break their young <HI>Colts.</HI> Now, you must know, I pass with her for as arrant a <HI>Rustick,</HI> as <HI>ever wield∣ed Cudgel at a Country Wake,</HI> or <HI>tumbled Girl upon a Hay-mow.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>But wherein can this advance your De∣sign?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Why, you must know, I make Love to her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Make Love to her! what, under the Character of a Footman?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fain.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, under the Character of a Gentleman of Fifteen hundred Pounds a Year in <HI>Gloucester-shire,</HI> of which Country I pretend to be; for having Quar∣ter'd heretofore in that Shire, I counterfeit the Dialect very well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what Service can this be to you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fain.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I write to her as from Mr. <HI>Worthy</HI>; my Man brings the Letters; and I deliver them as <HI>Jef∣frey,</HI> her Footman; and when I find her in Humour, I intend to give her my Picture, in so simple a Man∣ner, that she shall take it all for Gospel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what signifies the Copy? How will you introduce the Original?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fain.</SPEAKER>
<P>That has been done already. I have made her several Visits. My Man is now gone to her with a Letter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>But suppose she should enquire after this Mr. <HI>Worthy</HI>? It is an easy Matter to know all the Gentlemen in <HI>Gloucestershire,</HI> and what Estates they are possess'd of too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fain.</SPEAKER>
<P>She can't trap me there, if she does: For, between you and I, there is such a Person as Mr. <HI>Worthy,</HI> Master of the very Estate I mention, who has given me Leave to take his Name. — But I have discover'd since I have been in her House, that an <HI>Irish</HI> Baron is my Rival.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you are undone; for I am told, she declares against Matrimony without a Title. Who is he?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fain.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord <HI>Pharoah-Bank,</HI> I think they call him, of the County of <HI>Tipperary.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't remember ever to have heard of any such Nobleman.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Fain.</SPEAKER>
<P>Recommended, they say, by Sir <HI>Philip Mo∣ney-Love.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>For which he is to have a valuable Consi∣deration; for I am sure, he does nothing out of Honour or Honesty. I wish thee Success with all my Heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fain.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you, <HI>Freeman</HI>; but prithee, who are you in Mourning for? Is the old Knight at Rest Six Foot deep? ha, <HI>Jack?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has been dead to me these Seven Years; but is now so to all the World, <HI>Fainwell.</HI></P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope you'll give me the Estate too, <HI>Fainwell</HI>; for, I assure you, I have not one Foot of Land by the Death of my Father.</P>

<P>He did not disinherit thee, sure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Neither better nor worse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sam.</SPEAKER>
<P>I ever thought my old Master would dye hard, and take the Left-hand Road.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! what is <HI>Sam</HI> with you still?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sam.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know, Sir, I always stick as close to my Masters, as their Breeches.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay! whilst there is any Money in them; but, I remember, you left me for fear of Starving.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sam.</SPEAKER>
<P>Starving! Oh, no, no! — Not Starving, Sir; though, I must confess, my Waist-band was Three Inches too wide for me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fain.</SPEAKER>
<P>You saucy Rascal! ha, ha? Well, did you deliver my Letter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sam.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I did Sir; and into the Widow's own Hands; and, truly, by what I can find, Sir▪, you have nothing to hope for, if I have any Judgment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fain.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why? What have you discover'd?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sam.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I observ'd when she read your Epistle, she smil'd scornfully, thus —toss'd your Letter upon her Toylet; turn'd upon her Heel; tipp'd her Maid a Box o' the Ear for Grinning, and bad me tell you, it required no Answer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Cold Comfort!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fain.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not a Jot the less, for giving herself that Air. But is it possible, that pure Party-Rage could make thy Father so unkind, Sir <HI>John</HI>!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Add to that some little Wildnesses. But the main thing that did my Business, was this; When I found nothing wou'd open his Purse-strings, I pretended to embrace his Principles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sam.</SPEAKER>
<P>I remember that Time, Sir: We lived in Clover then! Many a delicious Morsel of Flesh have I serv'd up, and supp'd luxuriously out of your Leavings, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, as the Devil wou'd have it, one Day, in my Cups, I chanced to stumble into a Non-juring Meeting, with half a Dozen honest Officers at my Back, drove out the Congregation, ty'd the Par∣son Neck and Heels, lock'd the Door, and took the Key in my Pocket.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fain.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good! And what became of Old Sedition?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some of his Flock returning to Evening. Prayer, broke open the Door, and freed him from Durance; amongst which Number was my natural Father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fain.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rather Unnatural! That was very unlucky, Sir <HI>John.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay; for that Action not only lost me a paternal Blessing, but a paternal Estate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fain.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which would have afforded thee many Bles∣sings, Wine and Women, Sir <HI>John,</HI> the only Blessings in this World! So your younger Brother <HI>Ned</HI> has the Estate, I suppose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every Acre! My Fortune is cramm'd into such a Narrow Circumference, I can cover it with my Thumb. Only —a single Shilling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fain.</SPEAKER>
<P>Damn'd Barbarity! 'S' Death! were he my Brother, I'd cut his Throat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sam.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's the Inside of a Soldier for you!
<STAGE>aside.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>So say Passion and Necessity; but Con∣science and Humanity offer to my cooler Thoughts a brown Musquet rather. I confess, I long to exert the elder Brother, and beat him a little; In order to which, I have done all I could to provoke him to give me Occasion; but he avoids me as carefully as if he durst not fight, though I know he's no Coward.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fain.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well! Heaven be prais'd, I am not afraid of being disinherited. I wear my Fortune with my Red Coat; and whilst there is one Mischief-making Priest in the World, Soldiers will never want Bread.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sam.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, the Priests have ever been fast Friends to the Soldiers. Nothing like a Pulpit-Drum. —But it ruins the Surgeons Business quite.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay! how so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sam.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, where's the Occasion for their retailing Lancet, when the other lets the Nation Blood by Wholesale?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fain.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Rascal has a kind of smattering after Wit, ha, ha. No more of your Impertinence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sam.</SPEAKER>
<P>Impertinence! these Gentlemen will allow no body to say a good Thing but themselves.
<STAGE>Aside.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! yonder's my Brother coming this Way. How stately the Rogue walks, with Three Footmen at his Heels!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fain.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whilst thou hast not so much as one Scoundrel, to pick up a Wench for thee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sam.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, for that, Sir! with your Leave, he may always command his humble Servant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fain.</SPEAKER>
<P>He struts like an elder Brother. He wants nothing but your Title, Sir <HI>John.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish I could transfer it; for it is of no Use to me. Honour's a Commodity not vendable among the Merchants; there is no Draw-back upon't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fain.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's a Mistake, Sir <HI>John</HI>; I have known a Statesman pawn his Honour as often as Merchants enter the same Commodity for Exportation; and like them, draw it back so cleverly, that those who give him Credit upon't, never perceiv'd it 'till the Great Man was out of Post.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Honour's a stale Cheat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fain.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may pass at Court, or the Groom-Porter's; but no Citizen will lend a Shilling upon it.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Ned. Freeman.</STAGE>

<P>Brother! Your Servant. If this young Fellow had not been in a Livery, I should have sworn it had been Ensign <HI>Fainwell!</HI></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fain.</SPEAKER>
<P>The very Numerical Person you mention, is as you see, at your Service, Mr. <HI>Freeman.</HI> I believe you are surpriz'd at the Figure I make; but there are Reasons, which another time shall be yours. In the

mean while, I must intreat, that wherever you see me, you know me for nothing above my present Ap∣pearance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ned.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whatever Design you may have in View, it shall never miscarry through any Fault of mine.— Well! how go Matters in the North, Captain?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Party perform'd no Wonders there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ned.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, if you are entring upon Party Matters, good by-t'ye; You know I always decline Politicks in your Company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis the Sign of an ill Cause.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ned.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then Disputes won't mend it. Here — which Colour would you advise me to for a Wedding Suit?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fain.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! just upon the Brink of Matrimony? Is it with the <HI>Dutch</HI> Lady you wrote such Panegy∣ricks on, when you was in <HI>Holland?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ned.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, the old Burgo-master's Daughter of <HI>Haerlem</HI>? No, no! that Affair's ended long since. She was a good natur'd fond Fool, and, to say Truth, I did love her; but the old Carl her Father, did not like a younger Brother for a Son-in-Law then, and I'm a better Friend to my Country, than to take a <HI>Dutch</HI> Wife now. I did him one Piece of Service; I left some <HI>English</HI> Blood in his Family. I met a Gentleman at <HI>Paris,</HI> who told me, she was brought to Bed of a fine Boy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I mistake not, you made that Lady a Promise of Marriage, Brother.</P>

<P>Why, my Aunt is a <HI>Roman Catholick,</HI> you must know, and I suppose my Uncle had a mind to make a good Protestant of her, and brought the Doctor to Convert her; but finding his Arguments more prevalent for Love, than Religion, thought fit to remove her.</P>

<P>Not seeing her the last Time I din'd there, I inquir'd after her Health, and was answer'd, she was Indispos'd; yet I observ'd he cut her a Plate of ev'ry thing that came to the Table, and sent up to her Chamber, which, as the Maid told me afterwards, is his constant Custom of late, when any body Dines with him.

<P>Yes, Faith, and with one of the prettiest Wo∣men in Town; a Citizen's Wife, whose Husband is Tinctur'd with thy Uncle's Distemper: He permits her neither to pay, or receive Visits; but in spight of his <HI>Blockade,</HI> I have found means to open a <HI>Communi∣cation</HI> between my Self and his Female, and hope I shall be able to spring a <HI>Mine,</HI> and blow up the <HI>Fort</HI> of her Chastity, maugre all his Iron Guards.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>You talk like an Engineer, Mr. <HI>Freeman</HI>; but if she is so closely confin'd, how got you acquain∣ted with her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ned.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very accidentally. You must know, her House, and That which I lodge in, were formerly one, so that there are Doors remaining, tho' fasten'd up—Sit∣ting one Evening in my Chamber reading, I heard the Voice of Women, and found by their Discourse 'twas a Lady complaining to her Maid of her Hus∣band's ill Usage. If I were in your place, says the Maid, I'd be reveng'd of the old Brute: Ay, quoth the Lady, but shew me the Means.—Upon which, having bor'd a Hole in the Door, I put my Mouth to it, and cry'd, The Means is ready, Madam, if you'll Consent to it. She was a little surpriz'd at first, but we soon came to a right Understanding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fain.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha! so she open'd the Door!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ned.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not that Door: But the Chamber-Maid, who knew her Business perfectly well, after inquiring who Lodg'd at next House? in the Morning, knock'd
<PB N="14" REF="21"/>
gently at this private Door, and calling me by my Name, gave me to understand, that there was a Door, between her Room, and a Garret in our House, which if I cou'd find the way to open, I might have an Opportunity of playing a Game at Picquet with her Lady sometimes, in her Master's Absence: I took the Hint, agreed with my Landlord for that Garret, and fell to work immediately. The Passage was soon open'd, and we came to an Interview, lik'd one ano∣ther's Proposals, call'd for the Cards, and sat down to Play, where I had the Game all to Nothing, hav∣ing <HI>Point, Quint,</HI> and <HI>Quatorze,</HI> the first Deal, had not the old Fellow come in, and forc'd us to throw up our Cards.</P>
</SP>

<P>With all my Heart! Now for the finishing Stroke: I'll Home, and watch the old Fellow out, and then L'<HI>Affair il sera fait,</HI> as the <HI>French</HI> say— Which way are you going, <HI>Fainwell?</HI></P>

<P>Get out of your House! Get ready your Bail, Sir. The Allegations against you are so plain, and positive, you'll scarce have any Room for an Evasive Answer, or to cross-examine the Witnesses upon New Interrogatories, Sir, —Mind that.</P>

<P>Why, can you have the Assurance to deny it, after what the Gentleman has said?</P>

<P>His denying it, Madam, will signify nothing; we have unquestionable Proofs; Causes of this Na∣ture never come into our Court without Demon∣stration.— He must undergo the Sentence usual in these Cases. — Which is, To stand in a White-Sheet, and humbly confess his Faults before the Con∣gregation.

<P>It is a very pretty Mistake, tho', to come in∣to a Man's House, and abuse, and threaten him with White-Sheets, Penance, and the Devil; and then, <HI>I ask your Pardon, Sir.</HI> A Pox on you and your Pardon too, Sir.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are not qualify'd to know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Well, since your Conscience accuses you, you shall have a Priest. I'll send to the What-d'ye-call-'em Ambassador's, for one of his; who shall take your Confession in your Closet; but I'll stand at the Door: For I would not trust one of these Pardon-selling Rogues: They have such convincing Arguments for Cuckoldom.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you Two are One Flesh, how come you to have such different Minds, pray, Sir?</P>

<P>Yes, yes; I believe you understand Natural Philosophy very well, Wife: I doubt the Flesh has got the better of the Spirit in you.—Look ye, Madam!

<P>Ah! he's the sweetest natur'd Man in the World. Nobody ever saw him out of Humour, that ever I cou'd hear on: His Vather, indeed, wou'd

bawl, and make a noise, chu'd seem; but as for thick same Gentleman, he's quite another Thing; he is so good to the Poor, and so loving to all his Neigh∣bours; that there's not a Man Twenty Miles round him, but wou'd run thro' Fire and Water for him.— He is counted a main wise Man too; he makes no more of a Lawyer, or a Justice of the Peace, than, than, than, yow do of me, Madam.— Nay, it's thought by zome Volk, that he is so deep Learn'd, than an he wou'd, he cou'd puzzle, even the Parson o' the Parish.</P>

<P>Love, and War agree in every Point, my dear Widow; The Blockade of a Town resembles an obstinate Woman, and a Phlegmatick Lover, who resolves to weary her into Compliance. A Kiss now and then from a diffident Lover, is like stealing a March, and surprizing the Enemy, by a circumspect General. But eager and repeated Kisses, are, like Storming, more glorious to the Assailant.</P>

<SP>

<P>Methinks, <HI>Lucy,</HI> your Master seems to have an Air of true Penitence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>He does, indeed, look Penitential, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Philip.</SPEAKER>
<P>I've been considering you from Head to Foot, Sir <HI>John</HI>; and, upon my Soul, I think
<PB N="102" REF="109"/>
I never saw you look so well in all my Life: Tho', to say Truth, I always thought you a fine Gentleman.— 'Till he was Disinherited.
<STAGE>[Aside.]</STAGE>
— <HI>Olivia,</HI> Come hi∣ther, Child! Give me thy Hand; It was ever my Reso∣lution, that thou shou'dst go with the Estate; and therefore, Sir <HI>John,</HI> since you've got one, e'en take t'other.
<STAGE>[Throws her to him.]</STAGE>
— There, now do your Endeavour to make me, within Ten Months, a Grand∣father.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>On my Knees I thank you. This Present is more Welcome, than what my Brother gave me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ned.</SPEAKER>
<P>Return my Deed then; I did not give it you: You trick'd me out of it; Remember that, Brother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Out of nothing, but my own, Brother; but half my Estate is at your Service. Your Gene∣rosity to this Lady commands that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Philip.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say you so, Sir? Then your Generosity shall command but half my Daughter's Portion; Mark that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lou.</SPEAKER>
<P>I Bar that Injustice; the Fortune's all his own; Nor do we need your kind Indulgence, Brother.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ned.</SPEAKER>
<P>No! — Egad, I'm glad to hear that!
<STAGE>Aside.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lou.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yours was the Plot that made my <HI>Freeman</HI> mine; and Heaven Rewards you for't, with your Estate; and puts it in my Pow'r to raise your Bro∣ther above the Reach of Want. Know, then, My Father left me his only Heir, and Mistress of Forty Thousand Pounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ned.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! Say'st thou?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lou.</SPEAKER>
<P>I knew not where to find thee; but resolv'd to live Unmarried for thy Sake.— But, upon Sir <HI>John</HI>'s Letter, hasten'd to prevent thy Breach of Faith. 'Tis done; forgive the Artifice, and all my Fortune's thine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ned.</SPEAKER>
<P>Forgive thee! What, Forty Thousand Pounds, and ask Forgiveness! One Quarter of the Money wou'd purchase a Pardon for all the Sins of thee, and thy Posterity! I affirm, no Woman can be Guilty of any Fault, that has Forty Thousand Pounds—But
<PB N="103" REF="110"/>
few of thy Sex can boast such Constancy. How shall I thank thee for this excessive Goodness?—Brother! Let me thank you too. Had I known your Inclina∣tion for this Lady, you shou'd have had no Rival here.
<STAGE>Claps his Hand on his Breast.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Philip.</SPEAKER>
<P>And if he had not got the Estate again, he shou'd have had no Father here.
<STAGE>[Clapping his Hand on his Breast]</STAGE>
Come, come, 'tis all well, and the <HI>Man has his Mare again.</HI>—What are you musing on, Sir?
<STAGE>[<HI>To</HI> Watchit]</STAGE>
Prithee be chearful Man—Sup∣pose you were a Cuckold, the Fault's not yours, nor your Wife's neither: No doubt but you was born when <HI>Mars</HI> and <HI>Venus</HI> were in Conjunction; and if so, who can withstand their Fate?</P>

<P>Let him cease to be Jealous, and when I give him real Cause, let him expose me.—What say you, <HI>Mumps</HI>? Shall I enjoy the Liberties of an <HI>English</HI> Wife?</P>

<P>An <HI>English</HI> Wife! that's a large Latitude, <HI>Pud?</HI> But I agree to it; Come, Buss, and Friends then!

<P>A Fig for your Reflections; nothing wou'd go down with your Vanity, but a Lord, for∣sooth; and since no Lord of the King's making wou'd be troubled with you, I made one on purpose for you. Look-ye, 'tis my Opinion, ev'ry Man Cheats in his way—And he is only Honest, who is not discover'd.</P>

<P>Come, come, Madam, I think you have 'scap'd very well, considering all.

<P>I'm of my Brother's Opinion, Madam; Mr. <HI>Fainwell</HI> bears the King's Commission; and tho'
