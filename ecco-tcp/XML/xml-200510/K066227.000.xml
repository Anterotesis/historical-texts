OF THE
Scripture History of St. Paul
EVINCED.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD>EXPOSITION OF THE ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE volume of Christian scriptures
contains thirteen letters purporting
to be written by St. Paul; it contains also
a book, which amongst other things, pro∣fesses
to deliver the history, or rather me∣moirs
of the history, of this same person.
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
By assuming the genuineness of the letters,
we may prove the substantial truth of the
history; or, by assuming the truth of the
history, we may argue strongly in support
of the genuineness of the letters. But I as∣sume
neither one nor the other. The rea∣der
is at liberty to suppose these writings to
have been lately discovered in the library
of the Escurial, and to come to our hands
destitute of any extrinsic or collateral evi∣dence
whatever; and the argument I am
about to offer is calculated to shew, that a
comparison of the different writings would,
even under these circumstances, afford good
reason to believe the persons and transac∣tions
to have been real, the letters authen∣tic,
and the narration in the main to be
true.</P>
<P>Agreement or conformity between let∣ters
bearing the name of an ancient author,
and a received history of that author's life,
does not necessarily establish the credit of
either: because,</P>
<P N="1">1. The history may, like Middleton's
Life of Cicero, or Jortin's Life of Erasmus,
have been wholly, or in part, compiled
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
from the letters; in which case it is ma∣nifest
that the history adds nothing to the
evidence already afforded by the letters:
or,</P>
<P N="2">2. The letters may have been fabricated
out of the history: a species of imposture
which is certainly practicable; and which,
without any accession of proof or autho∣rity,
would necessarily produce the appear∣ance
of consistency and agreement: or,</P>
<P N="3">3. The history and letters may have
been founded upon some authority com∣mon
to both; as upon reports and tradi∣tions
which prevailed in the age in which
they were composed, or upon some ancient
record now lost, which both writers con∣sulted:
in which case also, the letters, with∣out
being genuine, may exhibit marks of
conformity with the history; and the his∣tory,
without being true, may agree with
the letters.</P>
<P>Agreement therefore, or conformity, is
only to be relied upon so far as we can ex∣clude
these several suppositions. Now the
point to be noticed is, that, in the three
cases above enumerated, conformity must
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
be the effect of <HI>design.</HI> Where the history
is compiled from the letters, which is the
first case, the design and composition of
the work are in general so confessed, or
made so evident by comparison, as to leave
us in no danger of confounding the pro∣duction
with original history, or of mis∣taking
it for an independent authority.
The agreement, it is probable, will be close
and uniform, and will easily be perceived
to result from the intention of the author,
and from the plan and conduct of his work.—Where
the letters are fabricated from the
history, which is the second case, it is al∣ways
for the purpose of imposing a forgery
upon the public; and, in order to give co∣lour
and probability to the fraud, names,
places, and circumstances, found in the his∣tory,
may be studiously introduced into the
letters, as well as a general consistency be
endeavoured to be maintained. But here
it is manifest, that whatever congruity ap∣pears,
is the consequence of meditation,
artifice, and design.—The third case is
that wherein the history and the letters,
without any direct privity or communica∣tion
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
with each other, derive their materials
from the same source; and, by reason of
their common original, furnish instances of
accordance and correspondency. This is a
situation in which we must allow it to be
possible for ancient writings to be placed;
and it is a situation in which it is more dif∣ficult
to distinguish spurious from genuine
writings, than in either of the cases de∣scribed
in the preceding suppositions; in∣asmuch
as the congruities observable are so
far accidental, as that they are not produced
by the immediate transplanting of names and
circumstances out of one writing into the
other. But although, with respect to each
other, the agreement in these writings be
mediate and secondary, yet is it not pro∣perly
or absolutely undesigned; because,
with respect to the common original from
which the information of the writers pro∣ceeds,
it is studied and factitious. The
case of which we treat must, as to the
letters, be a case of forgery; and when the
writer, who is personating another, sits
down to his composition—whether he have
the history with which we now compare
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
the letters, or some other record, before
him; or whether he have only loose tra∣dition
and reports to go by—he must adapt
his imposture, as well as he can, to what he
finds in these accounts; and his adaptations
will be the result of council, scheme, and
industry: art must be employed; and ves∣tiges
will appear of management and de∣sign.
Add to this, that, in most of the
following examples, the circumstances in
which the coincidence is remarked are of
too particular and domestic a nature, to
have floated down upon the stream of ge∣neral
tradition.</P>
<P>Of the three cases which we have stated,
the difference between the first and the two
others is, that in the first the design may be
fair and honest, in the others it must be ac∣companied
with the consciousness of fraud:
but in all there is design. In examining,
therefore, the agreement between ancient
writings, the character of truth and origi∣nality
is undesignedness: and this test ap∣plies
to every supposition; for, whether we
suppose the history to be true, but the let∣ters
spurious; or the letters to be genuine,
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
but the history false; or, lastly, falsehood
to belong to both—the history to be a fa∣ble,
and the letters fictitious; the same in∣ference
will result—that either there will be
no agreement between them, or the agree∣ment
will be the effect of design. Nor will
it elude the principle of this rule, to sup∣pose
the same person to have been the au∣thor
of all the letters, or even the author
both of the letters and the history; for no
less design is necessary to produce coinci∣dence
between different parts of a man's
own writings, especially when they are
made to take the different forms of a his∣tory
and of original letters, than to adjust
them to the circumstances found in any
other writing.</P>
<P>With respect to those writings of the New
Testament which are to be the subject of
our present consideration, I think that, as
to the authenticity of the epistles, this ar∣gument,
where it is sufficiently sustained by
instances, is nearly conclusive; for I cannot
assign a supposition of forgery, in which
coincidences of the kind we enquire after
are likely to appear. As to the history,
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
it extends to these points:—It proves the
general reality of the circumstances; it
proves the historian's knowledge of these
circumstances. In the present instance it
confirms his pretensions of having been a
cotemporary, and in the latter part of his
history a companion of St. Paul. In a
word, it establishes the substantial truth
of the narration: and <HI>substantial</HI> truth is
that which, in every historical enquiry,
ought to be the first thing sought after
and ascertained; it must be the ground
work of every other observation.</P>
<P>The reader then will please to remem∣ber
this word <HI>undesignedness,</HI> as denoting
that upon which the construction and va∣lidity
of our argument chiefly depend.</P>
<P>As to the proofs of undesignedness, I
shall in this place say little; for I had
rather the reader's persuasion should arise
from the instances themselves, and the se∣parate
remarks with which they may be
accompanied, than from any previous for∣mulary
or description of argument. In a
great plurality of examples, I trust he will
be perfectly convinced that no design or
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
contrivance whatever has been exercised:
and if some of the coincidences alledged
appear to be minute, circuitous, or ob∣lique,
let him reflect that this very indi∣rectness
and subtility is that which gives
force and propriety to the example. Broad,
obvious, and explicit agreements prove
little; because it may be suggested that the
insertion of such is the ordinary expedient
of every forgery: and though they may
occur, and probably will occur, in genuine
writings, yet it cannot be proved that they
are peculiar to these. Thus what St.
Paul declares in chap. xi. of 1 Cor. con∣cerning
the institution of the eucharist—"For
I have received of the Lord that
which I also delivered unto you, that
the Lord Jesus, the same night in which
he was betrayed, took bread; and when
he had given thanks, he brake it, and
said, Take, eat; this is my body, which
is broken for you; this do in remem∣brance
of me"—though it be in close
and verbal conformity with the account of
the same transaction preserved by St. Luke,
is yet a conformity of which no use can be
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
made in our argument; for if it should be
objected that this was a mere recital from
the gospel, borrowed by the author of the
epistle, for the purpose of setting off his
composition by an appearance of agree∣ment
with the received account of the
Lord's supper, I should not know how to
repel the insinuation. In like manner, the
description which St. Paul gives of himself,
in his epistle to the Philippians (iii. 5)—"Circumcised
the eighth day, of the stock
of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an
Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching
the law, a Pharisee; concerning zeal,
persecuting the church; touching the
righteousness which is in the law, blame∣less"—is
made up of particulars so plainly
delivered concerning him, in the Acts of
the Apostles, the Epistle to the Romans,
and the Epistle to the Galatians, that I
cannot deny but that it would be easy for
an impostor, who was fabricating a letter
in the name of St. Paul, to collect these
articles into one view. This, therefore, is
a conformity which we do not adduce.
But when I read, in the Acts of the Apo∣stles,
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
that "when Paul came to Derbe and
Lystra, behold a certain disciple was
there, named Timotheus, the son of a
certain woman <HI>which was a Jewess</HI>;"
and when, in an epistle addressed to Ti∣mothy,
I find him reminded of his "having
known the holy scriptures <HI>from a child,</HI>"
which implies that he must, on one side or
both, have been brought up by Jewish pa∣rents;
I conceive that I remark a coinci∣dence
which shews, by its very <HI>obliquity,</HI>
that scheme was not employed in its forma∣tion.
In like manner, if a coincidence de∣pend
upon a comparison of dates, or rather
of circumstances from which the dates are ga∣thered—the
more intricate that comparison
shall be; the more numerous the interme∣diate
steps through which the conclusion is
deduced; in a word, the more <HI>circuitous</HI>
the investigation is, the better, because the
agreement which finally results is thereby
farther removed from the suspicion of con∣trivance,
affectation, or design. And it
should be remembered, concerning these co∣incidences,
that it is one thing to be mi∣nute,
and another to be precarious; one
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
thing to be unobserved, and another to be
obscure; one thing to be circuitous or
oblique, and another to be forced, dubious,
or fanciful. And this distinction ought
always to be retained in our thoughts.</P>
<P>The very particularity of St. Paul's epis∣tles;
the perpetual recurrence of names of
persons and places; the frequent allusions to
the incidents of his private life, and the cir∣cumstances
of his condition and history; and
the connection and parallelism of those with
the same circumstances in the Acts of the
Apostles, so as to enable us, for the most
part, to confront them with one another;
as well as the relation which subsists between
the circumstances, as mentioned or referred
to in the different epistles—afford no incon∣siderable
proof of the genuineness of the
writings, and the reality of the transactions.
For as no advertency is sufficient to guard
against slips and contradictions, when cir∣cumstances
are multiplied, and when they
are liable to be detected by cotemporary ac∣counts
equally circumstantial, an impostor,
I should expect, would either have avoided
particulars entirely, contenting himself with
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
doctrinal discussions, moral precepts, and
general reflections<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This, however, must not be misunderstood. A person writing to his friends, and upon a subject in which the transactions of his own life were concerned, would probably be led in the course of his letter, espe∣cially if it was a long one, to refer to passages found in his history. A person addressing an epistle to the public at large, or under the form of an epistle delivering a discourse upon some speculative argument, would not, it is probable, meet with an occasion of alluding to the circumstances of his life at all: he might, or he might not; the chance on either side is nearly equal. This is the situation of the catholic epistle. Although, there∣fore, the presence of these allusions and agreements be a valuable accession to the arguments by which the au∣thenticity of a letter is maintained, yet the want of them certainly forms no positive objection.</NOTE>; or if, for the sake of
imitating St. Paul's style, he should have
thought it necessary to intersperse his com∣position
with names and circumstances, he
would have placed them out of the reach of
comparison with the history. And I am
confirmed in this opinion by an inspection
of two attempts to counterfeit St. Paul's
epistles, which have come down to us; and
the only attempts, of which we have any
knowledge, that are at all deserving of re∣gard.
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
One of these is an epistle to the
Laodiceans, extant in Latin, and preserved
by Fabricius in his collection of apocryphal
scriptures. The other purports to be an
epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians, in
answer to an epistle from the Corinthians
to him. This was translated by Scroderus
from a copy in the Armenian language
which had been sent to W. Whiston, and
was afterwards, from a more perfect copy
procured at Aleppo, published by his sons,
as an appendix to their edition of Moses
Chorenensis. No Greek copy exists of
either: they are not only not supported by
ancient testimony, but they are negatived
and excluded; as they have never found
admission into any catalogue of apostolical
writings, acknowledged by, or known to,
the early ages of Christianity. In the first
of these I found, as I expected, a total
<HI>evitation</HI> of circumstances. It is simply a
collection of sentences from the canonical
epistles, strung together with very little
skill. The second, which is a more versute
and specious forgery, is introduced with a
list of names of persons who wrote to St.
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
Paul from Corinth; and is preceded by an
account sufficiently particular of the man∣ner
in which the epistle was sent from Co∣rinth
to St. Paul, and the answer returned.
But they are names which no one ever
heard of; and the account it is impossible
to combine with any thing found in the
Acts, or in the other epistles. It is not ne∣cessary
for me to point out the internal
marks of spuriousness and imposture which
these compositions betray; but it was neces∣sary
to observe, that they do not afford
those coincidences which we propose as
proofs of authenticity in the epistles which
we defend.</P>
<P>Having explained the general scheme and
formation of the argument, I may be per∣mitted
to subjoin a brief account of the
manner of conducting it.</P>
<P>I have disposed the several instances of
agreement under separate numbers; as well
to mark more sensibly the divisions of the
subject, as for another purpose, viz. that the
reader may thereby be reminded that the
instances are independent of one another.
I have advanced nothing which I did not
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
think probable; but the degree of probabi∣lity,
by which different instances are sup∣ported,
is undoubtedly very different. If
the reader, therefore, meets with a number
which contains an instance that appears to
him unsatisfactory, or founded in mistake,
he will dismiss that number from the argu∣ment,
but without prejudice to any other.
He will have occasion also to observe, that
the coincidences discoverable in some epistles
are much fewer and weaker than what
are supplied by others. But he will add to his
observation this important circumstance—that
whatever ascertains the original of one
epistle, in some measure establishes the au∣thority
of the rest. For, whether these epis∣tles
be genuine or spurious, every thing
about them indicates that they come from
the same hand. The diction, which it is
extremely difficult to imitate, preserves its
resemblance and peculiarity throughout all
the epistles. Numerous expressions and
singularities of style, found in no other part
of the New Testament, are repeated in dif∣ferent
epistles; and occur, in their respective
places, without the smallest appearance of
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
force or art. An involved argumentation,
frequent obscurities, especially in the order
and transition of thought, piety, vehe∣mence,
affection, bursts of rapture, and of
unparalleled sublimity, are properties, all
or most of them, discernible in every letter
of the collection. But although these epis∣tles
bear strong marks of proceeding from
the same hand, I think it is still more cer∣tain
that they were originally separate pub∣lications.
They form no continued story;
they compose no regular correspondence;
they comprise not the transactions of any
particular period; they carry on no connec∣tion
of argument; they depend not upon
one another; except in one or two in∣stances,
they refer not to one another. I
will farther undertake to say, that no study
or care has been employed to produce or pre∣serve
an appearance of consistency amongst
them. All which observations shew that
they were not intended by the person, who∣ever
he was, that wrote them, to come
forth or be read together; that they ap∣peared
at first separately, and have been
collected since.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="20"/>
The proper purpose of the following
work is, to bring together, from the Acts
of the Apostles, and from the different epis∣tles,
such passages as furnish examples of
undesigned coincidence; but I have so far
enlarged upon this plan, as to take into it
some circumstances found in the epistles,
which contributed strength to the con∣clusion,
though not strictly objects of com∣parison.</P>
<P>It appeared also a part of the same plan,
to examine the difficulties which presented
themselves in the course of our enquiry.</P>
<P>I do not know that the subject has been
proposed or considered in this view before.
Ludovicus Capellus, Bishop Pearson, Dr.
Benson, and Dr. Lardner, have each given
a continued history of St. Paul's life, made
up from the Acts of the Apostles and the
epistles joined together. But this, it is
manifest, is a different undertaking from
the present, and directed to a different
purpose.</P>
<P>If what is here offered shall add one
thread to that complication of probabilities
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
by which the Christian history is attested,
the reader's attention will be repaid by the
supreme importance of the subject; and my
design will be fully answered.</P>

<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD>THE EPISTLE TO THE ROMANS.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>No. I.</HEAD>
<P>THE first passage I shall produce from
this epistle, and upon which a good
deal of observation will be founded, is the
following:</P>
<P>"But now I go unto Jerusalem, to mi∣nister
unto the saints; for it hath pleased
them of Macedonia and Achaia to make
a certain contribution for the poor saints
which are at Jerusalem." Rom. xv. 25,
26.</P>
<P>In this quotation three distinct circum∣stances
are stated—a contribution in Ma∣cedonia
for the relief of the Christians of
Jerusalem, a contribution in Achaia for the
same purpose, and an intended journey of
St. Paul to Jerusalem. These circum∣stances
are stated as taking place at the same
time, and that to be the time when the
epistle was written. Now let us enquire
whether we can find these circumstances
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
elsewhere; and whether, if we do find
them, they meet together in respect of date.
Turn to the Acts of the Apostles, chap. xx.
ver. 2, 3, and you read the following ac∣count:
"When he had gone over those
parts (viz. Macedonia), and had given
them much exhortation, he came into
Greece, and there abode three months;
and when the Jews laid wait for him, <HI>as
he was about to sail into Syria,</HI> he pur∣posed
to return through Macedonia."
From this passage, compared with the ac∣count
of St. Paul's travels given before,
and from the sequel of the chapter, it ap∣pears,
that upon St. Paul's <HI>second</HI> visit to the
peninsula of Greece, his intention was, when
he should leave the country, to proceed
from Achaia directly by sea to Syria; but
that, to avoid the Jews, who were lying in
wait to intercept him in his route, he so far
changed his purpose as to go back through
Macedonia, embark at Philippi, and pursue
his voyage from thence towards Jerusalem.
Here therefore is a journey to Jerusalem;
but not a syllable of any contribution. And
as St. Paul had taken several journeys to
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>
Jerusalem before, and one also immediately
after his <HI>first</HI> visit into the peninsula of
Greece (Acts xviii. 21.), it cannot from
hence be collected in which of these visits
the epistle was written, or, with certainty,
that it was written in either. The silence
of the historian, who professes to have been
with St. Paul at the time (v. 6.), concerning
any contribution, might lead us to look out
for some different journey, or might induce
us perhaps to question the consistency of
the two records, did not a very accidental
reference, in another part of the same his∣tory,
afford us sufficient ground to believe
that this silence was omission. When St.
Paul made his reply before Felix, to the
accusations of Tertullus, he alledged, as
was natural, that neither the errand which
brought him to Jerusalem, nor his conduct
whilst he remained there, merited the ca∣lumnies
with which the Jews had aspersed
him. "Now after many years (i. e. of
absence) <HI>I came to bring alms to my nation
and offerings</HI>; whereupon certain Jews from
Asia found me purified in the temple, nei∣ther
with multitude nor with tumult, who
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
ought to have been here before thee, and
object, if they had ought against me."
Acts xxiv. 17-19. This mention of alms
and offerings certainly brings the narrative
in the Acts nearer to an accordancy with
the epistle; yet no one, I am persuaded,
will suspect that this clause was put into St.
Paul's defence, either to supply the omission
in the preceding narrative, or with any view
to such accordancy.</P>
<P>After all, nothing is yet said or hinted
concerning the <HI>place</HI> of the contribution;
nothing concerning Macedonia and Achaia.
Turn therefore to the First Epistle to the
Corinthians, chap. xvi. ver. 1-4, and you
have St. Paul delivering the following di∣rections:
"Concerning the collection for
the saints, as I have given orders to the
churches of Galatia, even so do ye: upon
the first day of the week let every one
of you lay by him in store as God hath
prospered him, that there be no gather∣ings
when I come. And when I come,
whomsoever you shall approve by your
letters, them will I send to bring your
liberality unto Jerusalem; and if it be
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
meet that I go also, they shall go with
me." In this passage we find a contri∣bution
carrying on at Corinth, the capital of
Achaia, for the Christians of Jerusalem; we
find also a hint given of the possibility of
St. Paul's going up to Jerusalem himself,
after he had paid his visit into Achaia:
but this is spoken of rather as a possibility
than as any settled intention; for his first
thought was, "Whomsoever you shall ap∣prove
by your letters, them will I <HI>send</HI> to
bring your liberality to Jerusalem:" and,
in the sixth verse, he adds, "That ye may
bring me on my journey <HI>whithersoever</HI> I
go." This epistle purports to be written
after St. Paul had been at Corinth; for it
refers throughout to what he had done and
said amongst them whilst he was there. The
expression therefore, "When I come,"
must relate to a <HI>second</HI> visit; against which
visit the contribution spoken of was desired
to be in readiness.</P>
<P>But though the contribution in Achaia
be expressly mentioned, nothing is here
said concerning any contribution in Mace∣donia.
Turn therefore, in the third place,
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>
to the Second Epistle to the Corinthians,
chap. viii. ver. 1-4, and you will discover
the particular which remains to be sought
for: "Moreover, brethren, we do you to
wit of the grace of God bestowed on the
<HI>churches of Macedonia</HI>; how that, in a great
trial of affliction, the abundance of their
joy and their deep poverty abounded unto
the riches of their liberality; for to their
power I bear record, yea, and beyond
their power, they were willing of them∣selves;
praying us, with much entreaty,
that we would receive the gift, and take
upon us the fellowship of the ministering
to the saints." To which add chap. ix.
ver. 2: "I know the forwardness of your
mind, for which I boast of you to them
of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a
year ago." In this epistle we find St.
Paul advanced as far as Macedonia, upon
that <HI>second</HI> visit to Corinth which he pro∣mised
in his former epistle; we find also,
in the passages now quoted from it, that a
contribution was going on in Macedonia at
the same time with, or soon however fol∣lowing,
the contribution which was made
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>
in Achaia; but for whom the contribution
was made does not appear in this epistle at
all: that information must be supplied from
the first epistle.</P>
<P>Here therefore, at length, but fetched
from three different writings, we have ob∣tained
the several circumstances we en∣quired
after, and which the Epistle to the
Romans brings together, viz. a contribu∣tion
in Achaia for the Christians of Jeru∣salem;
a contribution in Macedonia for
the same; and an approaching journey of
St. Paul to Jerusalem. We have these cir∣cumstances—each
by some hint in the pas∣sage
in which it is mentioned, or by the
date of the writing in which the passage
occurs—fixed to a particular time; and we
have that time turning out, upon examina∣tion,
to be in all the <HI>same</HI>; namely, to∣wards
the close of St. Paul's second visit
to the peninsula of Greece. This is an
instance of conformity beyond the pos∣sibility,
I will venture to say, of ran∣dom
writing to produce. I also assert,
that it is in the highest degree improbable
that it should have been the effect of con∣trivance
<PB N="27" REF="29"/>
and design. The imputation of
<HI>design</HI> amounts to this, that the forger of
the Epistle to the Romans inserted in it
the passage upon which our observations
are founded, for the purpose of giving co∣lour
to his forgery by the appearance of
conformity with other writings which were
then extant. I reply, in the first place, that,
if he did this to countenance his forgery,
he did it for the purpose of an argument
which would not strike one reader in ten
thousand. Coincidences so circuitous as
this answer not the ends of forgery; are
seldom, I believe, attempted by it. In the
second place I observe, that he must have
had the Acts of the Apostles, and the two
Epistles to the Corinthians, before him at
the time. In the Acts of the Apostles (I
mean that part of the Acts which relates to
this period) he would have found the jour∣ney
to Jerusalem; but nothing about the
contribution. In the First Epistle to the
Corinthians he would have found a con∣tribution
going on in Achaia for the Chris∣tians
of Jerusalem, and a distant hint of the
possibility of the journey; but nothing con∣cerning
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
a contribution in Macedonia. In
the Second Epistle to the Corinthians he
would have found a contribution in Mace∣donia
accompanying that in Achaia; but
no intimation for whom either was intend∣ed,
and not a word about the journey. It
was only by a close and attentive collation
of the three writings, that he could have
picked out the circumstances which he has
united in his epistle; and by a still more
nice examination, that he could have deter∣mined
them to belong to the same period.
In the third place I remark, what dimi∣nishes
very much the suspicion of fraud,
how aptly and connectedly the mention
of the circumstances in question, viz. the
journey to Jerusalem, and of the occasion
of that journey, arises from the context.
"Whensoever I take my journey into Spain,
I will come to you; for I trust to see you
in my journey, and to be brought on my
way thitherward by you, if first I be
somewhat filled with your company.
<HI>But now I go unto Jerusalem, to minister
unto the saints; for it hath pleased them of
Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain</HI> <PB N="29" REF="31"/>
<HI>contribution for the poor saints which are at
Jerusalem.</HI> It hath pleased them verily,
and their debtors they are; for if the
Gentiles have been made partakers of
their spiritual things, their duty is also
to minister unto them in carnal things.
When therefore I have performed this,
and have sealed to them this fruit, I will
come by you into Spain." Is the passage
in <HI>Italics</HI> like a passage foisted in for an ex∣traneous
purpose? Does it not arise from
what goes before, by a junction as easy as
any example of writing upon real business
can furnish? Could any thing be more na∣tural
than that St. Paul, in writing to the
Romans, should speak of the time when he
hoped to visit them; should mention the
business which then detained him; and
that he purposed to set forwards upon
his journey to them, when that business
was completed?</P>

<P>By means of the quotation which form∣ed
the subject of the preceding number, we
collect, that the Epistle to the Romans was
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>
written at the conclusion of St. Paul's se∣cond
visit to the peninsula of Greece: but
this we collect, not from the epistle itself,
not from any thing <HI>declared</HI> concerning the
time and place in any part of the epistle,
but from a comparison of circumstances
referred to in the epistle, with the order of
events recorded in the Acts, and with re∣ferences
to the same circumstances, though
for quite different purposes, in the two
Epistles to the Corinthians. Now would
the author of a forgery, who sought to gain
credit to a spurious letter by congruities,
depending upon the time and place in
which the letter was supposed to be writ∣ten,
have left that time and place to be
made out, in a manner so obscure and in∣direct
as this is? If therefore coincidences
of circumstances can be pointed out in
this epistle, depending upon its date, or
the place where it was written, whilst that
date and place are only ascertained by other
circumstances, such coincidences may fairly
be stated as <HI>undesigned.</HI> Under this head I
adduce</P>
<P>Chap. xvi. 21-23. "Timotheus, my
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, and
Sosipater, my kinsmen, salute you. I Ter∣tius,
who wrote this epistle, salute you in
the Lord. Gaius mine host, and of the
whole church, saluteth you; and Quartus,
a brother." With this passage I compare
Acts xx. 4. "And there accompanied
him into Asia, Sopater of Berea; and, of
the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secun∣dus;
and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus;
and, of Asia, Tychicus, and Trophimus."
The Epistle to the Romans, we have seen, was
written just before St. Paul's departure from
Greece, after his second visit to that penin∣sula:
the persons mentioned in the quotation
from the Acts are those who accompanied
him in that very departure. Of seven whose
names are joined in the salutation of the
church of Rome, three, viz. Sosipater,
Gaius, and Timothy, are proved, by this
passage in the Acts, to have been with St.
Paul at the time. And this is perhaps as
much coincidence as could be expected from
reality, though less, I am apt to think, than
would have been produced by design. Four
are mentioned in the Acts who are not joined
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
in the salutation; and it is in the nature of
the case probable that there should be many
attending St. Paul in Greece who knew no∣thing
of the converts at Rome, nor were
known by them. In like manner several are
joined in the salutation who are not men∣tioned
in the passage referred to in the Acts.
This also was to be expected. The occasion
of mentioning them in the Acts was their
proceeding with St. Paul upon his journey.
But we may be sure that there were many
eminent Christians with St. Paul in Greece,
besides those who accompanied him into
Asia<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of these Jason is one, whose presence upon this occasion is very naturally accounted for. Jason was an inhabitant of Thessalonica in Macedonia, and enter∣tained St. Paul in his house upon his first visit to that country. Acts xvii. 7.—St. Paul, upon this his second visit, passed through Macedonia on his way to Greece, and, from the situation of Thessalonica, most likely thro' that city. It appears, from various instances in the Acts, to have been the practice of many converts to attend St. Paul from place to place. It is therefore highly probable, I mean that it is highly consistent with the account in the history, that Jason, according to that ac∣count a zealous disciple, the inhabitant of a city at no great distance from Greece, and through which, as it should seem, St. Paul had lately passed, should have ac∣companied St. Paul into Greece, and have been with him there at this time. Lucius is another name in the epistle. A very slight alteration would convert <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> into <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, Lucius into Luke, which would produce an ad∣ditional coincidence: for, if Luke was the author of the history, he was with St. Paul at this time; inasmuch as, describing the voyage which took place soon after the writing of this epistle, the historian uses the first person—"<HI>We</HI> sailed away from Philippi. Acts, xx. 6.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="35"/>
But if any one shall still contend that a
forger of the epistle, with the Acts of the
Apostles before him, and having settled his
scheme of writing a letter as from St. Paul
upon his second visit into Greece, would
casily think of the expedient of putting
in the names of those persons who appeared
to be with St. Paul at the time, as an ob∣vious
recommendation of the imposture;
I then repeat my observations: first, that he
would have made the catalogue more com∣plete;
and secondly, that with this contriv∣ance
in his thoughts, it was certainly his
business, in order to avail himself of the arti∣fice,
to have stated in the body of the epistle
that St. Paul was in Greece when he wrote
it, and that he was there upon his second
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
visit. Neither of which he has done, either
directly, or even so as to be discoverable by
any circumstance found in the narrative de∣livered
in the Acts.</P>
<P>Under the same head, viz. of coincidences
depending upon date, I cite from the epistle
the following salutation: "Greet Priscilla and
Aquila, my helpers in Christ Jesus, who
have for my life laid down their own necks;
unto whom not only I give thanks, but
also all the churches of the Gentiles."
Chap. xvi. 3.—It appears, from the Acts of
the Apostles, that Priscilla and Aquila had
originally been inhabitants of Rome; for
we read, Acts xviii. 2, that "Paul found a cer∣tain
Jew, named Aquila, lately come from
Italy with his wife Priscilla, because that
Claudius had commanded all Jews to de∣part
from <HI>Rome.</HI>" They were connected
therefore with the place to which the saluta∣tions
are sent. That is one coincidence; ano∣ther
is the following: St. Paul became ac∣quainted
with these persons at Corinth during
his first visit into Greece. They accompanied
him upon his return into Asia; were settled
for some time at Ephesus, Acts xviii. 19-26;
<PB N="35" REF="37"/>
and appear to have been with St. Paul when
he wrote from that place his first Epistle
to the Corinthians, 1 Cor. xvi. 19. Not
long after the writing of which epistle St.
Paul went from Ephesus into Macedonia,
and "after he had gone over those parts"
proceeded from thence upon his second visit
into Greece; during which visit, or rather
at the conclusion of it, the Epistle to the
Romans, as hath been shewn, was written.
We have therefore the time of St. Paul's re∣sidence
at Ephesus after he had written to the
Corinthians, the time taken up by his progress
through Macedonia (which is indefinite, and
was probably considerable), and his three
months abode in Greece; we have the sum
of these three periods allowed for Aquila and
Priscilla going back to Rome, so as to be
there when the epistle before us was written.
Now what this quotation leads us to observe
is, the danger of scattering names and circum∣stances
in writings like the present, how
implicated they often are with dates and
places, and that nothing but truth can pre∣serve
consistency. Had the notes of time in
the Epistle to the Romans fixed the writing
<PB N="36" REF="38"/>
of it to any date prior to St. Paul's first resi∣dence
at Corinth, the salutation of Aquila
and Priscilla would have contradicted the
history, because it would have been prior to
his acquaintance with these persons. If the
notes of time had fixed it to any period
during <HI>that</HI> residence at Corinth, during his
journey to Jerusalem when he first returned
out of Greece, during his stay at Antioch
whither he went down from Jerusalem, or
during his second progress through the Lesser
Asia upon which he proceeded from Antioch,
an equal contradiction would have been in∣curred;
because from Acts xviii. 2-18, 19-
26, it appears that during all this time Aquila
and Priscilla were either along with St. Paul,
or were abiding at Ephesus. Lastly, had the
notes of time in this epistle, which we have
seen to be perfectly incidental, compared
with the notes of time in the first Epistle
to the Corinthians, which are equally in∣cidental,
fixed this epistle to be either
cotemporary with that, or prior to it, a
similar contradiction would have ensued;
because, first, when the Epistle to the Corin∣thians
was written, Aquila and Priscilla were
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>
along with St. Paul, as they joined in the sa∣lutation
of that church, 1 Cor. xvi. 19; and
because, secondly, the history does not allow
us to suppose, that between the time of their
becoming acquainted with St. Paul, and the
time of St. Paul's writing to the Corin∣thians,
Aquila and Priscilla could have gone
to Rome, so as to have been saluted in an
epistle to that city; and then come back to St.
Paul at Ephesus, so as to be joined with him
in saluting the church of Corinth. As it is,
all things are consistent. The Epistle to the
Romans is posterior even to the second
Epistle to the Corinthians; because it speaks
of a contribution in Achaia being completed,
which the second Epistle to the Corinthians
chap. viii. is only soliciting. It is sufficiently
therefore posterior to the first Epistle to the
Corinthians, to allow time in the interval for
Aquila and Priscilla's return from Ephesus
to Rome.</P>
<P>Before we dismiss these two persons, we
may take notice of the terms of commenda∣tion
in which St. Paul describes them, and
of the agreement of that encomium with
the history. "My helpers in Christ Jesus,
<PB N="38" REF="40"/>
who have for my life laid down their
necks; unto whom not only I give thanks,
but also all the churches of the Gentiles."
In the eighteenth chapter of the Acts, we
are informed that Aquila and Priscilla were
Jews; that St. Paul first met with them at
Corinth; that for some time he abode in
the same house with them; that St. Paul's
contention at Corinth was with the unbe∣lieving
Jews, who at first "opposed and
blasphemed, and afterwards with one ac∣cord
raised an insurrection against him;"
that Aquila and Priscilla adhered, we may
conclude, to St. Paul throughout this whole
contest; for, when he left the city, they
went with him, Acts xiii. 18. Under these
circumstances, it is highly probable that they
should be involved in the dangers and per∣secutions
which St. Paul underwent from
the Jews, being themselves Jews; and, by
adhering to St. Paul in this dispute, deserters,
as they would be accounted, of the Jewish
cause. Farther, as they, though Jews, were
assisting to St. Paul in preaching to the Gen∣tiles
at Corinth, they had taken a decided
part in the great controversy of that day,
<PB N="39" REF="41"/>
the admission of the Gentiles to a parity of
religious situation with the Jews. For this
conduct alone, if there was no other reason,
they may seem to have been entitled to
"thanks from the churches of the Gentiles."
They were Jews taking part with Gen∣tiles.
Yet is all this so indirectly intimated,
or rather so much of it left to inference in
the account given in the Acts, that I do not
think it probable that a forger either could
or would have drawn his representation from
thence; and still less probable do I think it,
that, without having seen the Acts, he could
by mere accident, and without truth for his
guide, have delivered a representation so
conformable to the circumstances there re∣corded.</P>
<P>The two congruities last adduced depended
upon the time, the two following regard the
place, of the epistle.</P>
<P N="1">1. Chap. xvi. 23. "Erastus, the chamber∣lain
of the city, saluteth you"—of what
city? We have seen, that is, we have infer∣red
from circumstances found in the epistle,
compared with circumstances found in the
Acts of the Apostles, and in the two Epistles
<PB N="40" REF="42"/>
to the Corinthians, that our epistle was
written during St. Paul's second visit to the
peninsula of Greece. Again, as St. Paul,
in his epistle to the church of Corinth,
1 Cor. xvi. 3, speaks of a collection going
on in that city, and of his desire that it
might be ready against he came thither;
and as in this epistle he speaks of that col∣lection
being ready, it follows that the
epistle was written either whilst he was at
Corinth, or after he had been there. Thirdly,
since St. Paul speaks in this epistle of his
journey to Jerusalem, as about instantly to
take place; and as we learn, Acts xx. 3, that
his design and attempt was to sail upon that
journey immediately from Greece, properly
so called, <HI>i. e.</HI> as distinguished from Mace∣donia;
it is probable that he was in this
country when he wrote the epistle, in which
he speaks of himself as upon the eve of set∣ting
out. If in Greece, he was most likely
at Corinth; for the two Epistles to the Co∣rinthians
shew that the principal end of his
coming into Greece was to visit that city,
where he had founded a church. Certainly
we know no place in Greece in which his
<PB N="41" REF="43"/>
presence was so probable: at least, the
placing of him at Corinth satisfies every
circumstance. Now that Erastus was an
inhabitant of Corinth, or had some connec∣tion
with Corinth, is rendered a fair subject
of presumption, by that which is accident∣ally
said of him in the second Epistle to
Timothy, chap. iii. v. 20, "Erastus abode at
<HI>Corinth.</HI>" St. Paul complains of his soli∣tude,
and is telling Timothy what was
become of his companions: "Erastus abode
at Corinth; but Trophimus have I left at
Miletum, sick." Erastus was one of those
who had attended St. Paul in his travels,
Acts xix. 22; and when those travels had,
upon some occasion, brought our apostle
and his train to Corinth, Erastus staid there,
for no reason so probable as that it was his
home. I allow that this coincidence is not
so precise as some others, yet I think it too
clear to be produced by accident; for, of
the many places which this same epistle has
assigned to different persons, and the innu∣merable
others which it might have men∣tioned,
how came it to fix upon Corinth for
Erastus? And, as far as it is a coincidence,
<PB N="42" REF="44"/>
it is certainly undesigned on the part of the
author of the Epistle to the Romans: be∣cause
he has not told us of what city Erastus
was the chamberlain; or, which is the same
thing, from what city the epistle was writ∣ten,
the setting forth of which was abso∣lutely
necessary to the display of the co∣incidence,
if any such display had been
thought of: nor could the author of the
Epistle to Timothy leave Erastus at Corinth,
from any thing he might have read in the
Epistle to the Romans, because Corinth is
no where in that Epistle mentioned either
by name or description.</P>
<P N="2">2. Chap. xvi. 1-3. "I commend unto you
Phoebe, our sister, which is a servant of
the church which is at Cenchrea, that ye
receive her in the Lord, as becometh
saints, and that ye assist her in whatso∣ever
business she hath need of you; for
she hath been a succourer of many, and
of myself also." Cenchrea adjoined to
Corinth; St. Paul therefore, at the time of
writing the letter, was in the neighbourhood
of the woman whom he thus recommends.
But, farther, that St. Paul had before this
<PB N="43" REF="45"/>
been at Cenchrea itself, appears from the
eighteenth chapter of the Acts; and appears
by a circumstance as incidental, and as un∣like
design, as any that can be imagined.
"Paul after this tarried there (viz. at Co∣rinth)
yet a good while, and then took
his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence
into Syria, and with him Priscilla and
Aquila, having shorn his head <HI>in Cenchrea,</HI>
for he had a vow." xviii. 18. The shav∣ing
of the head denoted the expiration of
the Nazaritic vow. The historian therefore,
by the mention of this circumstance, vir∣tually
tells us that St. Paul's vow was ex∣pired
before he set forward upon his voyage,
having deferred probably his departure un∣til
he should be released from the restrictions
under which his vow laid him. Shall we
say that the author of the Acts of the Apostles
feigned this anecdote of St. Paul at Cenchrea,
because he had read in the Epistle to the
Romans that "Phoebe, a servant of the
church of Cenchrea, had been a succourer
of many, and of him also?" or shall we
say that the author of the Epistle to the
Romans, out of his own imagination, created
<PB N="44" REF="46"/>
Phoebe "<HI>a servant of the church at Cenchrea,</HI>"
because he read in the Acts of the Apostles
that Paul had "shorn his head" in that
place?</P>
</DIV3>

<P>Chap. i. ver. 13. "Now I would not have
you ignorant, brethren, that <HI>oftentimes I
purposed to come unto</HI> you, but was let
hitherto, that I might have some fruit
among you also, even as among other
Gentiles." Again, xv. 23, 24, "But now
having no more place in these parts, and
having a great desire these many years
(<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, oftentimes) to come unto you,
whensoever I take my journey into Spain
I will come to you; for I trust to see you
in my journey, and to be brought on my
way thitherward by you: but now I go
up unto Jerusalem, to minister to the
saints. When therefore I have perform∣ed
this, and have sealed to them this fruit,
I will come by you into Spain."</P>
<P>With these passages compare Acts xix.
v. 21. "After these things were ended (viz.
at Ephesus), Paul purposed in the spirit,
when he had passed through Macedonia
<PB N="45" REF="47"/>
and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem; saying,
After I have been there, I must also see
Rome."</P>
<P>Let it be observed that our epistle pur∣ports
to have been written at the conclusion
of St. Paul's second journey into Greece;
that the quotation from the Acts contains
words said to have been spoken by St.
Paul at Ephesus, some time before he set
forwards upon that journey. Now I con∣tend
that it is impossible that two indepen∣dent
fictions should have attributed to St.
Paul the same purpose, especially a purpose
so specific and particular as this, which was
not merely a general design of visiting
Rome, but a design of visiting Rome after he
had passed through Macedonia and Achaia,
and after he had performed a voyage from
these countries to Jerusalem. The confor∣mity
between the history and the epistle is
perfect. In the first quotation from the
epistle, we find that a design of visiting
Rome had long dwelt in the apostle's
mind: in the quotation from the Acts we
find that design expressed a considerable
time before the epistle was written. In the
<PB N="46" REF="48"/>
history we find that the plan which St.
Paul had formed, was to pass through Mace∣donia
and Achaia; after that, to go to Jeru∣salem;
and, when he had finished his visit
there, to sail for Rome. When the epistle
was written, he had executed so much of
his plan, as to have passed through Mace∣donia
and Achaia; and was preparing to
pursue the remainder of it, by speedily
setting out towards Jerusalem: and in this
point of his travels he tells his friends at
Rome, that, when he had completed the
business which carried him to Jerusalem, he
would come to them. Secondly, I say
that the very inspection of the passages will
satisfy us that they were not made up from
one another.</P>
<P>"Whensoever I take my journey into
Spain, I will come to you; for I trust to
see you in my journey, and to be brought
on my way thitherward by you: but
now I go up to Jerusalem, to minister to
the saints. When, therefore, I have per∣formed
this, and have sealed to them this
fruit, I will come by you into Spain."—This
from the epistle.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="49"/>
"Paul purposed in the spirit, when he
had passed through Macedonia and Achaia,
to go to Jerusalem; saying, After I have
been there, I must also see Rome."—This
from the Acts.</P>
<P>If the passage in the epistle was taken
from that in the Acts, why was <HI>Spain</HI> put
in? If the passage in the Acts was taken
from that in the epistle, why was <HI>Spain</HI>
left out? If the two passages were unknown
to each other, nothing can account for their
conformity but truth. Whether we suppose
the history and the epistle to be alike ficti∣tious,
or the history to be true but the letter
spurious, or the letter to be genuine but
the history a fable, the meeting with this
circumstance in both, if neither borrowed it
from the other, is, upon all these supposi∣tions,
equally inexplicable.</P>

<P>The following quotation I offer for the
purpose of pointing out a geographical co∣incidence,
of so much importance, that Dr.
Lardner considered it as a confirmation of
the whole history of St. Paul's travels.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="50"/>
Chap. xv. ver. 19. "So that from Jeru∣salem,
and round about unto Illyricum, I
have fully preached the gospel of Christ."</P>
<P>I do not think that these words necessa∣rily
import that St. Paul had penetrated into
Illyricum, or preached the gospel in that
province; but rather that he had come to
the confines of Illyricum (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>),
and that these confines were the external
boundary of his travels. St. Paul considers
Jerusalem as the centre, and is here viewing
the circumference to which his travels had
extended. The form of expression in the
original conveys this idea—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.
Illyricum was the
part of this circle which he mentions in an
Epistle to the Romans, because it lay in a
direction from Jerusalem towards that city,
and pointed out to the Roman readers the
nearest place to them, to which his travels
from Jerusalem had brought him. The
name of Illyricum no where occurs in the
Acts of the Apostles; no suspicion, there∣fore,
can be conceived that the mention of
it was borrowed from thence. Yet I think it
appears, from these same Acts, that St. Paul,
<PB N="49" REF="51"/>
before the time when he wrote his Epistle to
the Romans, had reached the confines of
Illyricum; or, however, that he might have
done so, in perfect consistency with the ac∣count
there delivered. Illyricum adjoins
upon Macedonia; measuring from Jerusalem
towards Rome, it lies close behind it. If,
therefore, St. Paul traversed the whole coun∣try
of Macedonia, the route would necessari∣ly
bring him to the confines of Illyricum,
and these confines would be described as the
extremity of his journey. Now the account
of St. Paul's second visit to the peninsula of
Greece, is contained in these words: "He
departed for to go into Macedonia; <HI>and
when he had gone over these parts,</HI> and had
given them much exhortation, he came
into Greece." Acts xx. 2. This account
allows, or rather leads us to suppose, that
St. Paul, in going over Macedonia (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>),
had passed so far to the west, as
to come into those parts of the country which
were contiguous to Illyricum, if he did
not enter into Illyricum itself. The history,
therefore, and the epistle so far agree, and
the agreement is much strengthened by a
<PB N="50" REF="52"/>
coincidence of <HI>time.</HI> At the time the epistle
was written, St. Paul might say, in confor∣mity
with the history, that he had "come
into Illyricum:" much before that time,
he could not have said so; for, upon his
former journey to Macedonia, his route is
laid down from the time of his landing at
Philippi to his sailing from Corinth. We
trace him from Philippi to Amphipolis and
Appollonia; from thence to Thessalonica;
from Thessalonica to Beraea; from Beraea
to Athens; and from Athens to Corinth:
which track confines him to the eastern side
of the peninsula, and therefore keeps him
all the while at a considerable distance from
Illyricum. Upon his second visit to Mace∣donia,
the history, we have seen, leaves him
at liberty. It must have been, therefore,
upon that second visit, if at all, that he ap∣proached
Illyricum; and this visit, we know,
almost immediately preceded the writing
of the epistle. It was natural that the
apostle should refer to a journey which was
fresh in his thoughts.</P>

far as Miletus, in Lesser Asia. This being
remembered, I observe that the two passages,
without any resemblance between them
that could induce us to suspect that they
<PB N="52" REF="54"/>
were borrowed from one another, represent
the state of St. Paul's mind, with respect to
the event of the journey, in terms of sub∣stantial
agreement. They both express his
sense of danger in the approaching visit to
Jerusalem; they both express the doubt
which dwelt upon his thoughts concerning
what might there befal him. When, in his
epistle, he entreats the Roman Christians,
"for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for
the love of the Spirit, to strive together
with him in their prayers to God for him,
that he might be delivered from them
which do not believe in Judaea," he suffi∣ciently
confesses his fears. In the Acts of
the Apostles we see in him the same appre∣hensions,
and the same uncertainty: "I go
bound in the Spirit to Jerusalem, <HI>not
knowing</HI> the things that shall befal me
there." The only difference is, that in
the history his thoughts are more inclined
to despondency than in the epistle. In
the epistle, he retains his hope "that he
should come unto them with joy by the
will of God;" in the history, his mind
yields to the reflection, "that the Holy
<PB N="53" REF="55"/>
Ghost witnesseth in every city that bonds
and afflictions awaited him." Now that
his fears should be greater, and his hopes
less, in this stage of his journey than when
he wrote his epistle, that is, when he first
set out upon it, is no other alteration than
might well be expected; since those pro∣phetic
intimations to which he refers, when
he says, "the Holy Ghost witnesseth in
every city," had probably been received
by him in the course of his journey, and
were probably similar to what we know
he received in the remaining part of it at
Tyre (xxi. 4), and afterwards from Aga∣bus
at Caesarea (xxi. 11).</P>

<P>There is another strong remark arising
from the same passage in the epistle; to
make which understood, it will be necessary
to state the passage over again, and some∣what
more at length.</P>
<P>"I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord
Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of
the Spirit, that ye strive together with
me in your prayers to God for me, that
<PB N="54" REF="56"/>
I may be delivered from them that do not
believe in Judaea—that I may come unto
you with joy by the will of God, and
may with you be refreshed."</P>
<P>I desire the reader to call to mind that
part of St. Paul's history which took place
after his arrival at Jerusalem, and which
employs the seven last chapters of the Acts;
and I build upon it this observation—that
supposing the Epistle to the Romans to
have been a forgery, and the author of the
forgery to have had the Acts of the Apostles
before him, and to have there seen that St.
Paul, in fact, "was <HI>not</HI> delivered from the
unbelieving Jews," but, on the contrary,
that he was taken into custody at Jerusa∣lem,
and brought to Rome a prisoner—it is
next to impossible that he should have made
St. Paul express expectations so contrary to
what he saw had been the event; and utter
prayers, with apparent hopes of success,
which he must have known were frustrated
in the issue.</P>
<P>This single consideration convinces me,
that no concert or consederacy whatever
subsisted between the epistle and the Acts
<PB N="55" REF="57"/>
of the Apostles; and that whatever coin∣cidences
have been or can be pointed out
between them, are unsophisticated, and are
the result of truth and reality.</P>
<P>It also convinces me that the epistle was
written not only in St. Paul's life time, but
before he arrived at Jerusalem; for the
important events relating to him which took
place after his arrival at that city, must have
been known to the Christian community
soon after they happened: they form the
most public part of his history. But had
they been known to the author of the
epistle—in other words, had they then taken
place—the passage which we have quoted
from the epistle would not have been found
there.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="7" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>No. VII.</HEAD>
<P>I now proceed to state the conformity
which exists between the argument of this
epistle and the history of its reputed au∣thor.
It is enough for this purpose to
observe, that the object of the epistle, that
is, of the argumentative part of it, was to
place the Gentile convert upon a parity of
situation with the Jewish, in respect of his
<PB N="56" REF="58"/>
religious condition, and his rank in the divine
favour. The epistle supports this point by
a variety of arguments; such as, "that no
man of either description was justified
by the works of the law—for this plain
reason, that no man had performed them;
that it became therefore necessary to ap∣point
another medium or condition of
justification, in which new medium the
Jewish peculiarity was merged and lost;
that Abraham's own justification was an∣terior
to the law, and independent of it;
that the Jewish converts were to consider
the law as now dead, and themselves as
married to another; that what the law
in truth could not do, in that it was weak
through the flesh, God had done by send∣ing
his son; that God had rejected the
unbelieving Jews, and had substituted in
their place a society of believers in Christ,
collected indifferently from Jews and Gen∣tiles."
Soon after the writing of this epi∣stle,
St. Paul, agreeably to the intention inti∣mated
in the epistle itself, took his journey
to Jerusalem. The day after he arrived
there, he was introduced to the church.
<PB N="57" REF="59"/>
What passed at this interview is thus related,
Acts xxi. 19: "When he had saluted them,
he declared particularly what things God
had wrought among the Gentiles by
his ministry: and, when they heard it,
they glorified the Lord; and said unto
him, Thou seest, brother, how many
thousands of Jews there are which believe;
and they are all zealous of the law; and
they <HI>are informed of thee,</HI> that thou teachest
all the Jews which are among the Gen∣tiles
to forsake Moses, saying, that they
ought not to circumcise their children,
neither to walk after the customs." St.
Paul disclaimed the charge; but there must
have been something to have led to it.
Now it is only to suppose that St. Paul
openly professed the principles which the
epistle contains; that, in the course of his
ministry, he had uttered the sentiments
which he is here made to write; and the
matter is accounted for. Concerning the
accusation which public rumour had brought
against him to Jerusalem, I will not say that
it was just; but I will say that, if he was
the author of the epistle before us, and if
<PB N="58" REF="60"/>
his preaching was consistent with his writ∣ing,
it was extremely natural; for, though
it be not a necessary, surely it is an easy
inference, that if the Gentile convert, who
did not observe the law of Moses, held as
advantageous a situation in his religious
interests as the Jewish convert who did,
there could be no strong reason for observing
that law at all. The remonstrance therefore
of the church of Jerusalem, and the report
which occasioned it, were founded in no
very violent misconstruction of the apostle's
doctrine. His reception at Jerusalem was
exactly what I should have expected the
author of this epistle to have met with. I
am entitled therefore to argue that a separate
narrative of effects experienced by St. Paul,
similar to what a person might be expected
to experience, who held the doctrines ad∣vanced
in this epistle, forms a proof that
he did hold these doctrines; and that the
epistle bearing his name, in which such doc∣trines
are laid down, actually proceeded
from him.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="8" TYPE="section">
<PB N="59" REF="61"/>
<HEAD>No. VIII.</HEAD>
<P>This number is supplemental to the for∣mer.
I propose to point out in it two par∣ticulars
in the conduct of the argument, per∣fectly
adapted to the historical circumstances
under which the epistle was written; which
yet are free from all appearance of contri∣vance,
and which it would not I think have
entered into the mind of a sophist to con∣trive.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Epistle to the Galatians relates to the
same general question as the Epistle to the
Romans. St. Paul had founded the church
of Galatia; at Rome he had never been. Ob∣serve
now a difference in his manner of treat∣ing
of the same subject, corresponding with
this difference in his situation. In the Epistle
to the Galatians he puts the point in a great
measure upon <HI>authority</HI>: "I marvel that ye
are so soon removed from him that called
you into the grace of Christ, unto another
gospel." Gal. i. 6. "I certify you, bre∣thren,
that the gospel which was preached
of me, is not after man; for I neither re∣ceived
it of man, neither was I taught it but
<PB N="60" REF="62"/>
by the revelation of Jesus Christ" (ch. i.
ver. 11, 12). "I am afraid lest I have bestowed
upon you labour in vain" (iv. 11, 12).
"I desire to be present with you now, for
I stand in doubt of you" (iv. 20). "Behold I,
Paul, say unto you, that, if ye be circumci∣sed,
Christ shall profit you nothing" (ch. v. 2).
This persuasion cometh not of him that call∣ed
you" (ch. v. 8). This is the style in which
he accosts the Galatians. In the epistle to the
converts of Rome, where his authority was
not established, nor his person known, he
puts the same point entirely upon <HI>argument.</HI>
The perusal of the epistle will prove this to
the satisfaction of every reader; and, as the
observation relates to the whole contents of
the epistle, I forbear adducing separate ex∣tracts.
I repeat therefore that we have pointed
out a distinction in the two epistles, suited to
the relation in which the author stood to his
different correspondents.</P>
<P>Another adaptation, and somewhat of the
same kind, is the following:</P>
<P N="2">2. The Jews we know were very nume∣rous
at Rome, and probably formed a princi∣pal
part amongst the new converts; so much
<PB N="61" REF="63"/>
so, that the Christians seem to have been
known at Rome rather as a denomination
of Jews, than as any thing else. In an epistle
consequently to the Roman believers, the
point to be endeavoured after by St. Paul was,
to reconcile the <HI>Jewish</HI> converts to the opinion,
that the Gentiles were admitted by God to a
parity of religious situation with themselves,
and that without their being bound by the law
of Moses. The Gentile converts would pro∣bably
accede to this opinion very readily. In
this epistle, therefore, though directed to the
Roman church in general, it is in truth a Jew
writing to Jews. Accordingly you will take
notice, that as often as his argument leads him
to say any thing derogatory from the Jewish
institution, he constantly follows it by a soft∣ening
clause. Having (ii. 28, 29) pro∣nounced,
not much perhaps to the satisfaction
of the native Jews, "that he is not a Jew
which is one outwardly, neither that cir∣cumcision
which is outward in the flesh,"
he adds immediately "what advantage then
hath the Jew, or what profit is there in cir∣cumcision?
<HI>much every way.</HI>" Having in the
<PB N="62" REF="64"/>
third chapter, ver. 28, brought his argument
to this formal conclusion, "that a man is jus∣tified
by faith, without the deeds of the
law," he presently subjoins, ver. 31, "do we
then make void the law through faith? God
forbid; <HI>yea, we establish the law.</HI>" In the se∣venth
chapter, when in the sixth verse he had
advanced the bold assertion, that "now we
are delivered from the law, that being dead
wherein we were held;" in the very next
verse he comes in with this healing question,
"What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God
forbid; nay, I had not known sin but by
the law." Having in the following words
insinuated, or rather more than insinuated, the
inefficacy of the Jewish law, viii. 3, "for what
the law could not do, in that it was weak
through the flesh, God sending his own Son
in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin,
condemned sin in the flesh;" after a di∣gression
indeed, but that sort of a digression
which he could never resist, a rapturous con∣templation
of his Christian hope, and which
occupies the latter part of this chapter; we
find him in the next, as if sensible that he
<PB N="63" REF="65"/>
had said something which would give offence,
returning to his Jewish brethren in terms of
the warmest affection and respect. "I say
the truth in Christ Jesus; I lie not; my
conscience also bearing me witness, in the
Holy Ghost, that I have great heaviness
and continual sorrow in my heart; for I
could wish that myself were accursed from
Christ, <HI>for my brethren, my kinsmen ac∣cording
to the flesh, who are Israelites, to
whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory,
and the covenants, and the giving of the law,
and the service of God, and the promises;
whose are the fathers; and of whom, as con∣cerning
the flesh, Christ came.</HI>" When, in
the thirty-first and thirty-second verses
of this ninth chapter, he represented to the
Jews the error of even the best of their
nation, by telling them that "Israel, which
followed after the law of righteousness,
had not attained to the law of righteous∣ness,
because they sought it not by faith,
but as it were by the works of the law,
for they stumbled at that stumbling-stone,"
he takes care to annex to his declaration
<PB N="64" REF="66"/>
these conciliating expressions: "Brethren,
<HI>my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel</HI>
is, that they might be saved; for I bear
them record that they <HI>have a zeal of God,</HI>
but not according to knowledge." Lastly,
having, ch. x. ver. 20, 21, by the applica∣tion
of a passage in Isaiah insinuated the
most ungrateful of all propositions to a
Jewish ear, the rejection of the Jewish
nation, as God's peculiar people; he
hastens, as it were, to qualify the intelli∣gence
of their fall by this interesting expos∣tulation:
"I say, then, hath God cast away
his people (i. e. wholly and entirely)?
<HI>God forbid</HI>; for I also am an Israelite, of
the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Ben∣jamin.
<HI>God hath not cast away his people
which he foreknew</HI>:" and follows this
thought, throughout the whole of the
eleventh chapter, in a series of reflections
calculated to soothe the Jewish converts, as
well as to procure from their Gentile
brethren respect to the Jewish institution.
Now all this is perfectly natural. In a real
St. Paul writing to real converts, it is what
<PB N="65" REF="67"/>
anxiety to bring them over to his persuasion
would naturally produce; but there is an
earnestness and a personality, if I may so call
it, in the manner, which a cold forgery,
I apprehend, would neither have conceived
nor supported.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD>THE FIRST EPISTLE TO THE CO∣RINTHIANS.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>No. I.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE we proceed to compare this
epistle with the history, or with any
other epistle, we will employ one number
in stating certain remarks applicable to
our argument, which arise from a persual
of the epistle itself.</P>
<P>By an expression in the first verse of the
seventh chapter, "now concerning the things
whereof ye wrote unto me," it appears, that
this letter to the Corinthians was writ∣ten
by St. Paul in answer to one which
he had received from them; and that the
seventh, and some of the following chapters,
are taken up in resolving certain doubts, and
regulating certain points of order, concern∣ing
which the Corinthians had in their letter
consulted him. This alone is a circum∣stance
considerably in favour of the authen∣ticity
<PB N="67" REF="69"/>
of the epistle: for it must have been
a far-fetched contrivance in a forgery, first
to have feigned the receipt of a letter from
the church of Corinth, which letter does not
appear; and then to have drawn up a ficti∣tious
answer to it, relative to a great variety
of doubts and enquiries, purely oeconomi∣cal
and domestic; and which, though like∣ly
enough to have occurred to an infant
society, in a situation and under an insti∣tution
so novel as that of a Christian church
then was, it must have very much exercised
the author's invention, and could have an∣swered
no imaginable purpose of forgery, to
introduce the mention of at all. Particulars
of the kind we refer to, are such as the fol∣lowing:
the rule of duty and prudence re∣lative
to entering into marriage, as applicable
to virgins, to widows; the case of husbands
married to unconverted wives, of wives having
unconverted husbands; that case where the
unconverted party chooses to separate, where
he chooses to continue the union; the effect
which their conversion produced upon their
prior state, of circumcision, of slavery; the
eating of things offered to idols, as it was in
<PB N="68" REF="70"/>
itself, as others were affected by it; the joining
in idolatrous sacrifices; the decorum to be
observed in their religious assemblies, the
order of speaking, the silence of women, the
covering or uncovering of the head, as it
became men, as it became women. These
subjects, with their several subdivisions, are
so particular, minute, and numerous, that,
though they be exactly agreeable to the cir∣cumstances
of the persons to whom the
letter was written, nothing, I believe, but
the existence and reality of those circum∣stances,
could have suggested to the writer's
thoughts.</P>
<P>But this is not the only nor the principal
observation upon the correspondence be∣tween
the church of Corinth and their
apostle, which I wish to point out. It
appears, I think, in this correspondence,
that although the Corinthians had written
to St. Paul, requesting his answer and his
directions in the several points above enu∣merated,
yet that they had not said one
syllable about the enormities and disorders
which had crept in amongst them, and
in the blame of which they all shared;
<PB N="69" REF="71"/>
but that St. Paul's information concerning
the irregularities then prevailing at Corinth,
had come round to him from other quarters.
The quarrels and disputes excited by their
contentious adherence to their different
teachers, and by their placing of them in
competition with one another, were not
mentioned in their <HI>letter,</HI> but communi∣cated
to St. Paul by more private intelli∣gence:
"It hath been declared unto me,
my brethren, <HI>by them which are of the house
of Chloe,</HI> that there are contentions among
you. Now this I say, that every one of
you saith, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos,
and I of Cephas, and I of Christ" (i. 11, 12).
The incestuous marriage "of a man with
his father's wife," which St. Paul repre∣hends
with so much severity in the fifth
chapter of our epistle, and which was not
the crime of an individual only, but a crime
in which the whole church, by tolerating
and conniving at it, had rendered themselves
partakers, did not come to St. Paul's know∣ledge
by the <HI>letter,</HI> but by a rumour which
had reached his ears: "<HI>It is reported commonly</HI>
that there is fornication among you, and
<PB N="70" REF="72"/>
such fornication as is not so much as
named among the Gentiles, that one
should have his father's wife; and ye are
puffed up, and have not rather mourned
that he that hath done this deed might be
taken away from among you" (v. 1, 2).
Their going to law before the judicature of
the country, rather than arbitrate and adjust
their disputes among themselves, which St.
Paul animadverts upon with his usual plain∣ness,
was not intimated to him in the <HI>letter,</HI>
because he tells them his opinion of this
conduct, before he comes to the contents of
the letter. Their litigiousness is censured
by St. Paul in the sixth chapter of his
epistle, and it is only at the beginning of
the seventh chapter that he proceeds upon
the articles which he found in their letter;
and he proceeds upon them with this pre∣face:
"Now concerning the things whereof
ye wrote unto me" (vii. 1); which intro∣duction
he would not have used, if he had
been already discussing any of the subjects
concerning which they had written. Their
irregularities in celebrating the Lord's sup∣per,
and the utter perversion of the institu∣tion
<PB N="71" REF="73"/>
which ensued, were not in the <HI>letter</HI>:
as is evident from the terms in which St.
Paul mentions the notice he had received
of it: "Now in this that I declare unto
you, I praise you not, that ye came to∣gether
not for the better, but for the
worse; for first of all, when ye come
together in the church, <HI>I hear</HI> that there
be divisions among you, and <HI>I partly
believe it.</HI>" Now that the Corinthians
should, in their own letter, exhibit the fair
side of their conduct to the Apostle, and
conceal from him the faults of their beha∣viour,
was extremely natural, and extremely
probable: but it was a distinction which
would not, I think, have easily occurred to
the author of a forgery; and much less
likely is it, that it should have entered into
his thoughts to make the distinction <HI>appear</HI>
in the way in which it does appear, viz.
not by the original letter, not by any express
observation upon it in the answer, but dis∣tantly
by marks perceivable in the manner,
or in the order, in which St. Paul takes
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of their faults.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="section">
<PB N="72" REF="74"/>
<HEAD>No. II.</HEAD>
<P>Our epistle purports to have been written
after St. Paul had already been at Corinth:
"I, brethren, <HI>when I came to you,</HI> came not
with excellency of speech or of wisdom"
(ii. 1): and in many other places to the
same effect. It purports also to have been
written upon the eve of another visit to that
church: "I will come to you shortly, if the
Lord will" (iv. 19); and again, "I will
come to you when I shall pass through Ma∣cedonia"
(xvi. 5). Now the history relates
that St. Paul did in fact visit Corinth <HI>twice</HI>;
once as recorded at length in the eighteenth,
and a second time as mentioned briefly in
the twentieth chapter of the Acts. The
same history also informs us, Acts xx. 1,
that it was from Ephesus St. Paul proceeded
upon his second journey into Greece. There∣fore,
as the epistle purports to have been
written a short time preceding that jour∣ney;
and as St. Paul, the history tells us,
had resided more than two years at Ephesus
before he set out upon it, it follows that it
must have been from Ephesus, to be con∣sistent
<PB N="73" REF="75"/>
with the history, that the epistle was
written; and every note of <HI>place</HI> in the
epistle agrees with this supposition. "If,
after the manner of men, I have fought
with beasts at <HI>Ephesus,</HI> what advantageth
it me, if the dead rise not?" (xv. 32). I
allow that the apostle might say this, where∣ever
he was; but it was more natural and
more to the purpose to say it, if he was at
Ephesus at the time, and in the midst of
those conflicts to which the expression re∣lates.
"The churches of Asia salute you"
(xvi. 19). Asia, throughout the Acts of the
Apostles and the epistles of St. Paul, does
not mean the whole of Asia Minor or Ana∣tolia,
nor even the whole of the proconsular
Asia, but a district in the anterior part of
that country, called Lydian Asia, divided
from the rest, much as Portugal is from
Spain, and of which district <HI>Ephesus</HI> was the
capital.—"Aquila and Priscilla salute you"
(xvi. 19). Aquila and Priscilla were at
<HI>Ephesus</HI> during the period within which this
epistle was written (Acts xviii. 18. 26).—"I
will tarry at <HI>Ephesus</HI> until Pentecost"
(xvi. 8). This, I apprehend, is in terms al∣most
<PB N="74" REF="76"/>
asserting that he was at Ephesus at the
time of writing the epistle.—"A great and
effectual door is opened unto me" (xvi. 9).
How well this declaration corresponded with
the state of things at Ephesus, and the pro∣gress
of the Gospel in these parts, we learn
from the reflection with which the historian
concludes the account of certain transactions
which passed there: "So mightily grew the
word of God and prevailed" (Acts xix. 20);
as well as from the complaint of Demetrius,
"that not only at Ephesus, but also through∣out
all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and
turned away much people" (xix. 26).—"And
there are many adversaries," says the
epistle, xvi. 9. Look into the history of
this period, "when divers were hardened
and believed not, but spake evil of that
way before the multitude, he departed from
them, and separated the disciples." The
conformity therefore upon this head of
comparison, is circumstantial and perfect.
If any one think that this is a conformity
so obvious, that any forger of tolerable cau∣tion
and sagacity, would have taken care to
preserve it, I must desire such a one to read
<PB N="75" REF="77"/>
the epistle for himself; and, when he has
done so, to declare, whether he has disco∣vered
one mark of art or design; whether
the notes of <HI>time</HI> and <HI>place</HI> appear to him
to be inserted with any reference to each
other, with any view of their being com∣pared
with each other, or for the purpose
of establishing a visible agreement with the
history, in respect of them.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>No. III.</HEAD>
<P>Chap. iv. ver. 17-19. "For this cause
I have sent unto you Timotheus, who is
my beloved son and faithful in the Lord,
who shall bring you into remembrance of
my ways which be in Christ, as I teach
every where in every church. Now some
are puffed up, as though I would not
come unto you; but I will come unto you
shortly, if the Lord will."</P>
<P>With this I compare Acts xix. 21, 22:
"After these things were ended, Paul pur∣posed
in the spirit, when he had passed
through Macedonia and <HI>Achaia,</HI> to go to
Jerusalem; saying, after I have been there,
<PB N="76" REF="78"/>
I must also see Rome: <HI>so</HI> he sent unto
Macedonia two of them that ministered
unto him, <HI>Timôtheus</HI> and Erastus."</P>
<P>Though it be not said, it appears I think
with sufficient certainty, I mean from the
history, independently of the epistle, that
Timothy was sent upon this occasion into
<HI>Achaia,</HI> of which Corinth was the capital city,
as well as into Macedonia; for the sending
of Timothy and Erastus is, in the passage
where it is mentioned, plainly connected with
St. Paul's own journey; <HI>he sent them before
him.</HI> As he therefore purposed to go into
<HI>Achaia</HI> himself, it is highly probable that
they were to go thither also. Nevertheless
they are said only to have been sent into
Macedonia, because Macedonia was in truth
the country to which they went immediately
from Ephesus; being directed, as we sup∣pose,
to proceed afterwards from thence
into Achaia. If this be so, the narrative
agrees with the epistle; and the agreement
is attended with very little appearance of
design. One thing at least concerning it is
certain: that if this passage of St. Paul's
history had been taken from his letter, it
<PB N="77" REF="79"/>
would have sent Timothy to Corinth by
name, or expressly however into Achaia.</P>
<P>But there is another circumstance in these
two passages much less obvious, in which
an agreement holds, without any room for
suspicion that it was produced by design.
We have observed that the sending of Ti∣mothy
into the peninsula of Greece was
connected in the narrative with St. Paul's
own journey thither; it is stated as the
effect of the same resolution. Paul pur∣posed
to go into Macedonia; "<HI>so</HI> he sent
two of them that ministered unto him, Ti∣motheus
and Erastus." Now in the epi∣stle
also you remark that, when the apostle
mentions his having sent Timothy unto
them, in the very next sentence he speaks
of his own visit: "for this cause have I
sent unto you Timotheus, who is my be∣loved
son, &amp;c. Now some are puffed up, as
though I would not come to you; but I
will come to you shortly, if God will."
Timothy's journey we see is mentioned in
the history, and in the epistle, in close con∣nection
with St. Paul's own. Here is the
same order of thought and intention; yet
<PB N="78" REF="80"/>
conveyed under such diversity of circum∣stance
and expression, and the mention of
them in the epistle so allied to the occasion
which introduces it, viz. the insinuation of
his adversaries that he would come to Co∣rinth
no more, that I am persuaded no at∣tentive
reader will believe, that these passages
were written in concert with one another,
or will doubt but that the agreement is un∣sought
and uncontrived.</P>
<P>But, in the Acts, Erastus accompanied
Timothy in this journey, of whom no men∣tion
is made in the epistle. From what has
been said, in our observations upon the Epistle
to the Romans, it appears probable that Eras∣tus
was a Corinthian. If so, though he ac∣companied
Timothy to Corinth, he was only
returning home, and Timothy was the mes∣senger
charged with St. Paul's orders. At
any rate, this discrepancy shews that the
passages were not taken from one another.</P>

<P>Chap. xvi. ver. 10, 11. "Now, if Timo∣theus
come, see that he may be with you
without fear; for he worketh the work of
<PB N="79" REF="81"/>
the Lord, as I also do: let no man therefore
despise him, but conduct him forth in
peace, that he may come unto me, for I
look for him with the brethren."</P>
<P>From the passage considered in the pre∣ceding
number, it appears that Timothy
was sent to Corinth, either with the epistle,
or before it: "for this cause have I sent
unto you Timotheus." From the passage
now quoted, we infer that Timothy was not
sent <HI>with</HI> the epistle; for had he been the
bearer of the letter, or accompanied it, would
St. Paul in that letter have said, "<HI>if</HI> Timothy
come?" Nor is the sequel consistent with the
supposition of his carrying the letter; for if
Timothy was with the Apostle when he wrote
the letter, could he say, as he does, "I look
for him with the brethren?" I conclude
therefore that Timothy had left St. Paul to
proceed upon his journey before the letter
was written. Farther, the passage before us
seems to imply, that Timothy was not ex∣pected
by St. Paul to arrive at Corinth, till
after they had received the letter. He gives
them directions in the letter how to treat
him when he should arrive; "if he come,"
<PB N="80" REF="82"/>
act towards him so and so. Lastly, the
whole form of expression is most naturally
applicable to the supposition of Timothy's
coming to Corinth, not directly from St.
Paul, but from some other quarter; and that
his instructions had been, when he should
reach Corinth, to return. Now, how stands
this matter in the history? Turn to the nine∣teenth
chapter and twenty-first verse of the
Acts, and you will find that Timothy did
not, when sent from Ephesus, where he left
St. Paul, and where the present epistle was
written, proceed by a straight course to Co∣rinth,
but that he went round through Ma∣cedonia.
This clears up every thing; for,
although Timothy was sent forth upon his
journey before the letter was written, yet
he might not reach Corinth till after the
letter arrived there; and he would come to
Corinth, when he did come, not directly
from St. Paul at Ephesus, but from some
part of Macedonia. Here therefore is a
circumstantial and critical agreement, and
unquestionably without design; for neither
of the two passages in the epistle mentions
Timothy's journey into Macedonia at all,
<PB N="81" REF="83"/>
though nothing but a circuit of that kind
can explain and reconcile the expressions
which the writer uses.</P>

<P>Chap. 1. ver. 12. "Now this I say, that
every one of you saith, I am of Paul, and
I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of
Christ."</P>
<P>Also, iii. 6, "I have planted, Apollos wa∣tered,
but God gave the increase."</P>
<P>This expression; "I have planted, Apollos
watered," imports two things; first, that Paul
had been at Corinth before Apollos; secondly,
that Apollos had been at Corinth after Paul,
but before the writing of this epistle. This im∣plied
account of the several events, and of the
order in which they took place, corresponds
exactly with the history. St. Paul, after his
first visit into Greece, returned from Corinth
into Syria by the way of Ephesus; and, drop∣ping
his companions Aquila and Priscilla at
Ephesus, he proceeded forwards to Jerusalem:
from Jerusalem he descended to Antioch; and
from thence made a progress through some
<PB N="82" REF="84"/>
of the upper or northern provinces of the
Lesser Asia (Acts xviii. 19. 23): during which
progress, and consequently in the interval
between St. Paul's first and second visit to
Corinth, and consequently also before the
writing of this epistle, which was at Ephe∣sus
two years at least after the apostle's re∣turn
from his progress, we hear of Apollos,
and we hear of him at Corinth. Whilst St.
Paul was engaged, as hath been said, in
Phrygia and Galatia, Apollos came down to
Ephesus; and being, in St. Paul's absence, in∣structed
by Aquila and Priscilla, and having
obtained letters of recommendation from the
church at Ephesus, he passed over to Achaia;
and when he was there, we read that he
"helped them much which had believed
through grace, for he mightily convinced
the Jews, and that publicly." Acts xviii. 27,
28. To have brought Apollos into Achaia,
of which Corinth was the capital city, as well
as the principal Christian church; and to
have shewn that he preached the gospel in
that country, would have been sufficient for
our purpose. But the history happens also
to mention Corinth by name, as the place
<PB N="83" REF="85"/>
in which Apollos, after his arrival in Achaia,
fixed his residence; for, proceeding with the
account of St. Paul's travels, it tells us, that
while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul, having
passed through the upper coasts, came down
to Ephesus (xix. 1). What is said there∣fore
of Apollos, in the epistle, coincides ex∣actly,
and especially in the point of chrono∣logy,
with what is delivered concerning him
in the history. The only question now is,
whether the allusions were made with a re∣gard
to this coincidence. Now, the occa∣sions
and purposes for which the name of
Apollos is introduced in the Acts and in
the epistles, are so independent and so re∣mote,
that it is impossible to discover the
smallest reference from one to the other.
Apollos is mentioned in the Acts, in im∣mediate
connection with the history of
Aquila and Priscilla, and for the very sin∣gular
circumstance of his "knowing only
the baptism of John." In the epistle, where
none of these circumstances are taken notice
of, his name first occurs, for the purpose of
reproving the contentious spirit of the Co∣rinthians;
and it occurs only in conjunction
<PB N="84" REF="86"/>
with that of some others: "Every one of
you saith, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos,
and I of Cephas, and I of Christ." The
second passage in which Apollos appears,
"I have planted, Apollos watered," fixes,
as we have observed, the order of time
amongst three distinct events; but it fixes
this, I will venture to pronounce, without
the writer perceiving that he was doing any
such thing. The sentence fixes this order
in exact conformity with the history; but it
is itself introduced solely for the sake of the
reflection which follows: "Neither is he
that planteth any thing, neither he that wa∣tereth,
but God that giveth the increase."</P>

<P>Chap. iv. ver. 11, 12. "Even unto this
present hour we both hunger and thirst,
and are naked, and are buffetted, and have
no certain dwelling-place; and labour,
working with our own hands."</P>
<P>We are expressly told, in the history, that
at Corinth St. Paul laboured with his own
hands: "He found Aquila and Priscilla; and,
because he was of the same craft, he abode
<PB N="85" REF="87"/>
with them, and wrought; for by their oc∣cupation
they were tent-makers." But,
in the text before us, he is made to say,
that "he laboured <HI>even unto the present hour,</HI>"
that is, to the time of writing the epistle at
Ephesus. Now, in the narration of St.
Paul's transactions at Ephesus, delivered in
the nineteenth chapter of the Acts, nothing
is said of his working with his own hands;
but in the twentieth chapter we read, that
upon his return from Greece, he sent for
the elders of the church of Ephesus, to
meet him at Miletus; and in the discourse
which he there addressed to them, amidst
some other reflections which he calls to
their remembrance, we find the following:
"I have coveted no man's silver, or gold,
or apparel; yea, you yourselves also know,
that these hands have ministered unto my
necessities, and to them that were with me."
The reader will not forget to remark, that
though St. Paul be now at Miletus, it is to
the elders of the church of Ephesus he is
speaking, when he says, "Ye yourselves
know that these hands have ministered to
my necessities;" and that the whole dis∣course
<PB N="86" REF="88"/>
relates to his conduct, during his
last preceding residence at Ephesus. That
manual labour therefore, which he had ex∣ercised
at Corinth, he continued at Ephesus;
and not only so, but continued it during
that particular residence at Ephesus, near
the conclusion of which this epistle was
written: so that he might, with the strictest
truth, say, at the time of writing the epistle,
"Even <HI>unto this present hour</HI> we labour,
working with our own hands." The
correspondency is sufficient then, as to the
undesignedness of it. It is manifest to my
judgment, that if the history, in this article,
had been taken from the epistle, this cir∣cumstance,
if it appeared at all, would have
appeared in its <HI>place,</HI> that is, in the direct
account of St. Paul's transactions at Ephe∣sus.
The correspondency would not have
been effected, as it is, by a kind of reflected
stroke, that is, by a reference in a subsequent
speech, to what in the narrative was omitted.
Nor is it likely, on the other hand, that a
circumstance which is not extant in the
history of St. Paul at Ephesus, should have
been made the subject of a factitious allusion,
<PB N="87" REF="89"/>
in an epistle purporting to be written by
him from that place: not to mention that
the allusion itself, especially as to time, is
too oblique and general to answer any pur∣pose
of forgery whatever.</P>

<P>Chap. ix. ver. 20. "And unto the Jews
I became as a Jew, that I might gain the
Jews; to them that are under the law, as
under the law."</P>
<P>We have the disposition here described,
exemplified in two instances which the his∣tory
records; one, Acts xvi. ver. 3: "Him
(Timothy) would Paul have to go forth
with him, and took and circumcised him,
<HI>because of the Jews in those quarters</HI>; for
they knew all that his father was a Greek."
This was before the writing of the epistle.
The other, Acts xxi. ver. 23, 26, and after
the writing of the epistle: "Do this that we
say to thee: we have four men which have
a vow on them: them take, and purify
thyself with them, that they may shave
their heads; and all may know that those
things, whereof they were informed con∣cerning
<PB N="88" REF="90"/>
thee, are nothing; but that thou
thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest
the law.—Then Paul took the men, and
the next day, <HI>purifying himself with them,
entered into the temple.</HI>" Nor does this
concurrence between the character and the
instances look like the result of contrivance.
St. Paul, in the epistle, describes, or is made
to describe, his own accommodating conduct
towards Jews and towards Gentiles, towards
the weak and over-scrupulous, towards men
indeed of every variety of character; "to
them that are without law as without law,
being not without law to God, but under
the law to Christ, that I might gain them
that are without law; to the weak became
I as weak, that I might gain the weak; I
am made all things to all men, that I might
gain some." This is the sequel of the text
which stands at the head of the present num∣ber.
Taking therefore the whole passage
together, the apostle's condescension to the
Jews is mentioned only as a part of his
general disposition towards all. It is not
probable, that this character should have
been made up from the instances in the
<PB N="89" REF="91"/>
Acts, which relate solely to his dealings with
the Jews. It is not probable that a sophist
should take his hint from those instances,
and then extend it so much beyond them:
and it is still more incredible, that the two
instances in the Acts, circumstantially re∣lated,
and interwoven with the history,
should have been fabricated in order to suit
the character, which St. Paul gives of himself
in the epistle.</P>

<P>Chap. i. 14-17. "I thank God that I
baptized none of you but Crispus and Gaius,
lest any should say that I baptized in my
own name; and I baptized also the house∣hold
of Stephanas: besides, I know not
whether I baptized any other; for Christ
sent me not to baptize, but to preach the
gospel."</P>
<P>It may be expected that those whom the
apostle baptized with his own hands, were
converts distinguished from the rest by some
circumstance, either of eminence, or of con∣nection
with him. Accordingly, of the three
<PB N="90" REF="92"/>
names here mentioned, Crispus, we find,
from Acts xviii. ver. 8, was a "chief ruler
of the Jewish synagogue at Corinth, who
believed in the Lord, with all his house."
Gaius, it appears from Romans xvi. 23,
was St. Paul's host at Corinth, and the host,
he tells us, "of the whole church." The
household of Stephanas, we read in the six∣teenth
chapter of this epistle, "were the first
fruits of Achaia." Here therefore is the
propriety we expected: and it is a proof
of reality not to be contemned; for their
names appearing in the several places in
which they occur, with a mark of distinc∣tion
belonging to each, could hardly be
the effect of chance, without any truth to
direct it: and, on the other hand, to sup∣pose
that they were picked out from these
passages, and brought together in the text
before us, in order to display a conformity
of names, is both improbable in itself, and is
rendered more so, by the purpose for which
they are introduced. They come in to assist
St. Paul's exculpation of himself, against the
possible charge, of having assumed the cha∣racter
<PB N="91" REF="93"/>
of the founder of a separate religion,
and with no other visible, or, as I think,
imaginable design<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. i. ver. 1. "Paul called to be an apostle or Jesus Christ, through the will of God, and Sosthenes, our brother, unto the church of God, which is at Corinth."—The only account we have of any person who bore the name of Sosthenes, is found in the eight∣eenth chapter of the Acts. When the Jews at Corinth had brought Paul before Gallio, and Gallio had dismissed their complaint as unworthy of his interference, and had driven them from the judgment-seat; "then all the Greeks," says the historian, "took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judg∣ment-seat." The Sosthenes here spoken of was a Corinthian; and if he was a Christian, and with St. Paul when he wrote this epistle, was likely enough to be joined with him in the salutation of the Corinthian church. But here occurs a difficulty. If Sosthenes was a Christian at the time of this uproar, why should the <HI>Greeks</HI> beat him? The assault upon the Christians was made by the <HI>Jews.</HI> It was the <HI>Jews</HI> who had brought Paul before the magistrate. If it had been the Jews also who had beaten Sosthenes, I should not have doubted but that he had been a favourer of St. Paul, and the same person who is joined with him in the epistle. Let us see therefore whether there be not some error in our present text. The Alexandrian manuscript gives <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> alone, without <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and is followed in this reading by the Coptic version, by the Arabic version, published by Erpenius, by the Vulgate, and by Bede's Latin version. Three Greek manuscripts again, as well as Chrysostom, give <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, in the place of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. A great plurality of manuscripts authorize the reading which is retained in our copies. In this variety it appears to me extreme∣ly probable that the historian originally wrote <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> alone, and that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> have been re∣spectively added as explanatory of what the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> was supposed to mean. The sentence, without the addi∣tion of either name, would run very perspicuously thus: "<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: and he drove them away from the judgment-seat; and they all," viz. the crowd of Jews whom the judge had bid begone, "took Sosthenes, and beat him before the judg∣ment seat." It is certain that, as the whole body of the people were Greeks, the application of <HI>all</HI> to them is unusual and hard. If I was describing an insurrection at Paris, I might say <HI>all</HI> the Jews, <HI>all</HI> the Protestants, or <HI>all</HI> the English acted so and so; but I should scarcely say <HI>all</HI> the French, when the whole mass of the community were of that description. As what is here offered is founded upon a various reading, and that in opposition to the greater part of the manuscripts that are extant, I have not given it a place in the text.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>The churches of Galatia and Phrygia
were the last churches which St. Paul had
visited before the writing of this epistle.
He was now at Ephesus, and he came
thither immediately from visiting these
churches: "He went over all the country
of Galatia and Phrygia, in order, strength∣ening
all the disciples. And it came to
pass that Paul having passed through the
<PB N="94" REF="96"/>
upper coasts" (viz. the above-named coun∣tries,
called the upper coasts, as being the
northern part of Asia Minor); "came to
Ephesus." Acts xviii. ver. 23; xix. 1.
These therefore, probably, were the last
churches at which he had left directions
for their public conduct during his absenc.
Although two years intervened between his
journey to Ephesus, and his writing this
epistle, yet it does not appear that during
that time he visited any other church. That
he had not been silent when he was in Galatia,
upon this subject of contribution for the
poor, is farther made out from a hint which
he lets fall in his epistle to that church:

them: "I was minded to come unto you
before, that you might have a second
benefit; and to pass by you into Mace∣donia,
and to come again out of Mace∣donia
unto you, and of you to be brought
on my way toward Judea. When I,
therefore, was thus minded, did I use
lightness? Or the things that I purpose,
do I purpose according to the flesh, that
with me there should be yea, yea, and
nay, nay? But, as God is true, our word
toward you was not yea and nay." It
appears from this quotation, that he had not
only intended, but that he had promised
them a visit before; for, otherwise, why
should he apologize for the change of his
purpose, or express so much anxiety, lest this
change should be imputed to any culpable
fickleness in his temper; and lest he should
thereby seem to them, as one whose word
was not, in any sort, to be depended upon?
Besides which, the terms made use of plainly
refer to a promise: "Our <HI>word toward you</HI>
was not yea and nay." St. Paul therefore
had signified an intention which he had not
<PB N="96" REF="98"/>
been able to execute; and this seeming
breach of his word, and the delay of his
visit, had, with some who were evil affected
towards him, given birth to a suggestion

<P>Dr. Benson tells us, that from this passage,
compared with chapter xvi. ver. 8, it has
been conjectured that this epistle was writ∣ten
about the time of the Jewish passover;
and to me the conjecture appears to be very
well founded. The passage to which Dr.
Benson refers us is this: "I will tarry at
Ephesus until Pentecost." With this pas∣sage
he ought to have joined another in
the same context: "And it may be that I
will abide, yea and winter with you:"
for, from the two passages laid together, it
follows that the epistle was written before
<PB N="97" REF="99"/>
Pentecost, yet after winter; which necessa∣rily
determines the date to the part of the
year, within which the passover falls. It
was written before Pentecost, because he
says, "I will tarry at Ephesus until Pen∣tecost."
It was written after winter, be∣cause
he tells them, "It may be that I may
abide, yea and winter with you." The
winter which the apostle purposed to pass
at Corinth, was undoubtedly the winter
next ensuing to the date of the epistle; yet
it was a winter subsequent to the ensuing
Pentecost, because he did not intend to set
forwards upon his journey till after that
feast. The words "let us keep the feast,
not with old leaven, neither with the lea∣ven
of malice and wickedness, but with the
unleavened bread of sincerity and truth,"
look very like words suggested by the season;
at least they have, upon that supposition, a
force and significancy which do not belong to
them upon any other; and it is not a little
remarkable, that the hints casually dropped
in the epistle, concerning particular parts
of the year, should coincide with this sup∣position.</P>

<HEAD>THE SECOND EPISTLE TO THE

<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>No. I.</HEAD>
<P>I WILL not say that it is impossible,
having seen the first Epistle to the Co∣rinthians,
to construct a second with osten∣sible
allusions to the first; or that it is im∣possible
that both sould be fabricated, so
as to carry on an order and continuation
of story, by successive references to the same
events. But I say, that this, in either case,
must be the effect of craft and design.
Whereas, whoever examines the allusions
to the former epistle, which he finds in this,
whilst he will acknowledge them to be such,
as would rise spontaneously to the hand of
the writer, from the very subject of the
correspondence, and the situation of the cor∣responding
parties, supposing these to be
real, will see no particle of reason to suspect,
either that the clauses containing these allu∣sions
<PB N="99" REF="101"/>
were <HI>insertions</HI> for the purpose, or that
the several transactions of the Corinthian
church were feigned, in order to form a
train of narrative, or to support the appear∣ance
of connection between the two epistles.</P>
<P N="1">1. In the first epistle, St. Paul announces his
intention of passing through Macedonia, in
his way to Corinth: "I will come to you
when I shall pass through Macedonia."
In the second epistle, we find him arrived
in Macedonia, and about to pursue his jour∣ney
to Corinth. But observe the manner
in which this is made to appear: "I know
the forwardness of your mind, for which
I boast of you to them of Macedonia,
that Achaia was ready a year ago, and
your zeal hath provoked very many:
yet have I sent the brethren, lest our
boasting of you should be in vain in this
behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready,
lest haply, if they of Macedonia come
with me, and find you unprepared, we,
that we say not you, be ashamed in this
same confident boasting" (chap. ix. 2, 3, 4).
St. Paul's being in Macedonia at the time of
writing the epistle, is, in this passage, in∣ferred
<PB N="100" REF="102"/>
only from his saying, that he had
boasted to the Macedonians of the alacrity
of his Achaian converts; and the fear which
he expresses, lest, if any of the Macedonian
Christians should come with him into
Achaia, they should sind his boasting un∣warranted
by the event. The business of
the contribution is the sole cause of men∣tioning
Macedonia at all. Will it be in∣sinuated
that this passage was framed merely
to state that St. Paul was now in Mace∣donia;
and, by that statement, to produce
an apparent agreement with the purpose of
visiting Macedonia, notified in the first epi∣stle?
Or will it be thought probable, that,
if a sophist had meant to place St. Paul in
Macedonia, for the sake of giving coun∣tenance
to his forgery, he would have done
it in so oblique a manner as through the
medium of the contribution? The same
thing may be observed of another text in
the epistle, in which the name of Macedo∣nia
occurs: "Furthermore, when I came to
Troas to preach the gospel, and a door
was opened unto me of the Lord, I had
no rest in my spirit, because I found not
<PB N="101" REF="103"/>
Titus, my brother; but taking my leave
of them, I went from thence into Mace∣donia."
I mean, that it may be observed
of this passage also, that there is a reason for
mentioning Macedonia, entirely distinct from
the purpose of shewing St. Paul to be <HI>there.</HI>
Indeed, if the passage before us shew that
point at all, it shews it so obscurely, that
Grotius, though he did not doubt that Paul
was now in Macedonia, refers this text to
a different journey. Is this the hand of a
forger, meditating to establish a false con∣formity?
The text, however, in which it is
most strongly implied that St. Paul wrote
the present epistle from Macedonia, is found
in the fourth, fifth, and sixth verses of the
seventh chapter: "I am filled with comfort,
I am exceeding joyful in all our tribula∣tion;
for, when we were come into Mace∣donia,
our flesh had no rest; without were
fightings, within were fears; neverthe∣less
God, that comforteth those that are
cast down, comforted us by the coming
of Titus." Yet even here, I think, no
one will contend, that St. Paul's coming to
Macedonia, or being in Macedonia, was the
<PB N="102" REF="104"/>
principal thing intended to be told; or that
the telling of it indeed, was any part of the
intention with which the text was written;
or that the mention even of the name of
Macedonia was not purely incidental, in the
description of those tumultuous sorrows with
which the writer's mind had been lately
agitated, and from which he was relieved
by the coming of Titus. The sive first
verses of the eighth chapter, which commend
the liberality of the Macedonian churches,
do not, in my opinion, by themselves prove
St. Paul to have been in Macedonia, at the
time of writing the epistle.</P>
<P N="2">2. In the first epistle, St. Paul denounces
a severe censure against an incestuous mar∣riage,
which had taken place amongst the
Corinthian converts, with the connivance,
not to say with the approbation, of the
church; and enjoins the church to purge
itself of this scandal, by expelling the of∣fender
from its society: "It is reported
commonly, that there is fornication among
you, and such fornication, as is not so
much as named amongst the Gentiles, that
one should have his father's wife; and ye
<PB N="103" REF="105"/>
are puffed up, and have not rather mourn∣ed,
that he that hath done this deed might
be taken away from among you; for I,
verily, as absent in body, but present in
spirit, have judged already, as though I
were present, concerning him that hath so
done this deed; in the name of our Lord
Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered toge∣ther,
and my spirit, with the power of
our Lord Jesus Christ, to deliver such a
one unto Satan for the destruction of the
flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the
day of the Lord" (chap. v. ver. 1-5).
In the second epistle, we sind this sentence
executed, and the offender to be so affected
with the punishment, that St. Paul now in∣tercedes
for his restoration: "Sufficient to
such a man is this punishment, which was
inflicted of many; so that, contrariwise, ye
ought rather to sorgive him and comfort
him, lest perhaps such a one should be
swallowed up with over-much sorrow;
wherefore I beseech you, that ye would
confirm your love towards him" (2 Cor.
chap. ii. ver. 7, 8). Is this whole business
feigned for the sake of carrying on a conti∣nuation
<PB N="104" REF="106"/>
of story through the two epistles?
The church also, no less than the offender,
was brought by St. Paul's reproof to a deep
sense of the impropriety of their conduct.
Their penitence, and their respect to his au∣thority,
were, as might be expected, exceed∣ingly
grateful to St. Paul: "We were com∣forted
not by Titus's coming only, but by
the consolation wherewith he was com∣forted
in you, when he told us your earnest
desire, your mourning, your fervent mind
towards me, so that I rejoiced the more;
for, bough I made you sorry with a
letter, I do not repent, though I did re∣pent;
for I perceive that the same epistle
made you sorry, though it were but for a
season. Now I rejoice, not that ye were
made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to re∣pentance;
for ye were made sorry after a
godly manner, that ye might receive da∣mage
by us in nothing" (chap. vii. 7-9).
That this passage is to be referred to the
incestuous marriage, is proved by the twelfth
verse of the same chapter: "Though I
wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause
that had done the wrong, nor for his cause
<PB N="105" REF="107"/>
that suffered wrong; but that our care for
you, in the sight of God, might appear
unto you." There were, it is true, various
topics of blame noticed in the first epistle;
but there was none, except this of the in∣cestuous
marriage, which could be called a
transaction between private parties, or of
which it could be said that one particular
person had "done the wrong," and another
particular person "had suffered it." Could all
this be without foundation? or could it be
put into the second epistle, merely to furnish
an obscure sequel to what had been said about
an incestuous marriage in the first?</P>
<P N="3">3. In the sixteenth chapter of the first
epistle, a collection for the saints is recom∣mended
to be set forwards at Corinth:
"Now, concerning the collection for the
saints, as I have given order to the
churches of Galatia, so do ye" (chap. xvi.
ver. 1). In the ninth chapter of the second
epistle, such a collection is spoken of, as in
readiness to be received: "As touching the
ministering to the saints, it is superfluous
for me to write to you, for I know the
forwardness of your mind, for which I
<PB N="106" REF="108"/>
boast of you to them of Macedonia, that
Achaia was ready a year ago, and your
zeal hath provoked very many" (chap. ix.
ver. 1, 2). This is such a continuation of
the transaction as might be expected; or,
possibly it will be said, as might easily be
counterfeited: but there is a circumstance
of nicety in the agreement between the two
epistles, which, I am convinced, the author
of a forgery would not have hit upon, or
which, if he had hit upon it, he would have
set forth with more clearness. The second
epistle speaks of the Corinthians as having
begun this eleemosynary business a year be∣fore:
"This is expedient for you, who have
begun before, not only to do, but also to
be forward a year ago" (chap. viii. ver. 10).
"I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that
Achaia was ready a year ago" (chap. ix.
ver. 2). From these texts it is evident, that
something had been done in the business a
year before. It appears, however, from
other texts in the epistle, that the contribu∣tion
was not yet collected or paid; for bre∣thren
were sent from St. Paul to Corinth,
"to make up their bounty" (chap. ix. ver. 5).
<PB N="107" REF="109"/>
They are urged to "perform the doing of
it" (chap. viii. ver. 11). "And every
man was exhorted to give as he purposed
in his heart" (chap. ix. ver. 7). The
contribution therefore, as represented in our
present epistle, was in readiness, yet not re∣ceived
from the contributors; was begun,
was forward long before, yet not hitherto
collected. Now this representation agrees
with one, and only with one supposition,
namely, that every man had laid by in store,
had already provided the fund, from which
he was afterwards to contribute—the very
case which the first epistle authorises us to
suppose to have existed; for in that epistle
St. Paul had charged the Corinthians, "up∣on
the first day of the week, every one of
them to lay by in store as God had pro∣spered
him"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following observations will satisfy us concern∣ing the purity of our Apostle's conduct in the suspicious business of a pecuniary contribution.</P>
<P N="1">1. He disclaims the having received any inspired au∣thority for the directions which he is giving: "I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forward∣ness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love" (2 Cor. chap. viii. ver. 8). Who, that had a sinister purpose to answer by the recommending of subscriptions, would thus distinguish, and thus lower the credit of his own recommendation?</P>
<P N="2">2. Although he asserts the general right of christian ministers to a maintenance from their ministry, yet he protests against the making use of this right in his own person: "Even so hath the Lord ordained, that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel; but I have used none of these things, neither have I written these things that it should be so done unto me; for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying, i. e. my professions of dis∣interestedness, void" (1 Cor. chap. ix. ver. 14, 15).</P>
<P N="3">3. He repeatedly proposes that there should be asso∣ciates with himself in the management of the public bounty; not colleagues of his own appointment, but per∣sons elected for that purpose by the contributors them∣selves: "And when I come, whomsoever ye shall ap∣prove by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem; and if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me" (1 Cor. chap. xvi. ver. 3, 4). And in the second epistle, what is here proposed, we find actually done, and done for the very purpose of guarding his character against any imputation that might be brought upon it, in the discharge of a pecuniary trust: "And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches; and not that only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace (gift) which is adminis∣tered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and the declaration of your ready mind; avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is ad∣ministered by us; providing for things honest, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men;" i. e. "not resting in the consciousness of our own integrity, but, in such a subject, careful also to approve our integrity to the public judgment" (2 Cor. chap. viii. ver. 18-21).</P></NOTE> (1 Cor. chap. xvi. ver. 2).</P>

<P>In comparing the second Epistle to the
Corinthians with the Acts of the Apostles,
we are soon brought to observe, not only
that there exists no vestige either of the epi∣stle
having been taken from the history, or
the history from the epistle; but also that
there appears in the contents of the epistle
positive evidence, that neither was borrowed
from the other. Titus, who bears a conspi∣cuous
<PB N="109" REF="111"/>
part in the epistle, is not mentioned
in the Acts of the Apostles at all. St. Paul's
sufferings enumerated, chap. xi. ver. 24,
"of the Jews five times received I forty
stripes save one; thrice was I beaten with
rods; once was I stoned; thrice I suffered
shipwreck; a night and a day I have been
in the deep," cannot be made out from
<PB N="110" REF="112"/>
his history, as delivered in the Acts, nor
would this account have been given by a
writer, who either drew his knowledge of
St. Paul from that history, or who was care∣ful
to preserve a conformity with it. The
account in the epistle, of St. Paul's escape
from Damascus, though agreeing in the
main fact with the account of the same
transaction in the Acts, is related with such
difference of circumstance, as renders it ut∣terly
improbable that one should be derived
from the other. The two accounts, placed
by the side of each other, stand as follows:</P>
<P><TABLE>
<ROW>
<CELL>2 Cor. chap. xi. ver. 32,
33. "In Damascus, the
governor under Are∣tas
the king, kept the
city of the Damascenes
with a garrison, desirous
to apprehend me; and
through a window in a
basket was I let down by
the wall, and escaped his
hands."</CELL>
<CELL>Acts, chap. ix. ver. 23-25. "And after many days
were fulfilled, the Jews
took counsel to kill him;
but their laying in wait
was known of Saul, and
they watched the gates
day and night to kill him;
then the disciples took
him by night, and let him
down by the wall in a bas∣ket."</CELL>

<P>Now if we be satisfied in general concern∣ing
these two ancient writings, that the one
<PB N="111" REF="113"/>
was not known to the writer of the other,
or not consulted by him; then the accor∣dances
which may be pointed out between
them, will admit of no solution so probable,
as the attributing of them to truth and reality,
as to their common foundation.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>No. III.</HEAD>
<P>The opening of this epistle exhibits a
connection with the history, which alone
would satisfy my mind, that the epistle was
written by St. Paul, and by St. Paul in the
situation in which the history places him.
Let it be remembered, that in the nineteenth
chapter of the Acts, St. Paul is represented
as driven away from Ephesus, or as leaving
however Ephesus, in consequence of an
uproar in that city, excited by some inte∣rested
adversaries of the new religion. The
account of the tumult is as follows: "When
they heard these sayings," viz. Deme∣trius's
complaint of the danger to be appre∣hended
from St. Paul's ministry to the esta∣blished
worship of the Ephesian goddess,
"they were full of wrath, and cried out,
saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians;
<PB N="112" REF="114"/>
and the whole city was filled with confu∣sion;
and having caught Gaius and Aris∣tarchus,
Paul's companions in travel, they
rushed with one accord into the theatre;
and when Paul would have entered in
unto the people, the disciples suffered him
not; and certain of the chief of Asia,
which were his friends, sent unto him,
desiring that he would not adventure him∣self
into the theatre. Some, therefore,
cried one thing, and some another; for the
assembly was confused, and the more part
knew not wherefore they were come to∣gether.
And they drew Alexander out
of the multitude, the Jews putting him
forward; and Alexander beckoned with
his hand, and would have made his de∣fence
unto the people; but, when they
knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice,
about the space of two hours, cried out,
Great is Diana of the Ephesians.—And
after the uproar was ceased, Paul called
unto him the disciples, and embraced
them, and departed for to go into Mace∣donia."
When he was arrived in Mace∣donia,
he wrote the second Epistle to the
<PB N="113" REF="115"/>
Corinthians which is now before us; and
he begins his epistle in this wise: "Blessed
be God, even the father of our Lord
Jesus Christ, the father of mercies, and
the God of all comfort, who comforteth
us in all our tribulation, that we may be
able to comfort them which are in any
trouble, by the comfort wherewith we
ourselves are comforted of God. For, as
the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so
our consolation also aboundeth by Christ:
and whether we be afflicted, it is for your
consolation and salvation, which is ef∣fectual
in the enduring of the same suffer∣ings,
which we also suffer; or whether we
be comforted, it is for your consolation
and salvation; and our hope of you is
steadfast, knowing that, as ye are partakers
of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the
consolation. For we would not, brethren,
have you ignorant of our trouble <HI>which
came to us in Asia,</HI> that we were pressed
out of measure, above strength, inso∣much
that we despaired even of life; but
we had the sentence of death in ourselves,
that we should not trust in ourselves, but
<PB N="114" REF="116"/>
in God which raiseth the dead, who de∣livered
us from so great a death, and doth
deliver; in whom we trust that he will
yet deliver us." Nothing could be more
expressive of the circumstances in which the
history describes St. Paul to have been, at the
time when the epistle purports to be written;
or rather, nothing could be more expressive
of the sensations arising from these circum∣stances,
than this passage. It is the calm
recollection of a mind emerged from the
confusion of instant danger. It is that de∣votion
and solemnity of thought, which fol∣lows
a recent deliverance. There is just
enough of particularity in the passage, to shew
that it is to be referred to the tumult at
Ephesus: "We would not, brethren, have
you ignorant of our trouble which came
to us in Asia." And there is nothing more;
no mention of Demetrius, of the seizure of
St. Paul's friends, of the interference of the
town-clerk, of the occasion or nature of the
danger which St. Paul had escaped, or even
of the city where it happened; in a word,
no recital from which a suspicion could be
conceived, either that the author of the
<PB N="115" REF="117"/>
epistle had made use of the narrative in the
Acts; or, on the other hand, that he had
sketched the outline, which the narrative in
the Acts only filled up. That the forger of
an epistle, under the name of St. Paul, should
borrow circumstances from a history of St.
Paul then extant; or, that the author of a
history of St. Paul should gather materials
from letters bearing St. Paul's name, may be
credited: but I cannot believe that any forger
whatever should fall upon an expedient so
resined, as to exhibit sentiments adapted to a
situation, and to leave his readers to seek out
that situation from the history; still less, that
the author of a history should go about to
frame facts and circumstances, fitted to sup∣ply
the sentiments which he found in the
letter. It may be said, perhaps, that it does
not appear from the history, that any danger
threatened St. Paul's life in the uproar at
Ephesus, so imminent as that, from which
in the epistle he represents himself to have
been delivered. This matter, it is true, is
not stated by the historian in form; but the
personal danger of the apostle, we cannot
doubt, must have been extreme, when the
<PB N="116" REF="118"/>
"whole city was filled with confusion;"
when the populace had "seized his com∣panions;"
when, in the distraction of
his mind, he insisted upon "coming forth
amongst them;" when the Christians who
were about him "would not suffer him;"
when "his friends, certain of the chief of
Asia, sent to him, desiring that he would
not adventure himself in the tumult;"
when, lastly, he was obliged to quit imme∣diately
the place and the country, "and,
when the tumult was ceased, to depart
into Macedonia." All which particulars
are found in the narration, and justify St.
Paul's own account, "that he was pressed
out of measure, above strength, insomuch
that he despaired even of life, that he had
the sentence of death in himself;" <HI>i. e.</HI> that
he looked upon himself as a man condemned
to die.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>No. IV.</HEAD>
<P>It has already been remarked, that St.
Paul's original intention was to have visited
Corinth in his way to Macedonia: "I was
minded to come unto you before, and to
pass by you into Macedonia" (2 Cor.
<PB N="117" REF="119"/>
chap. i. ver. 15, 16). It has also been remarked
that he changed this intention, and ulti∣mately
resolved upon going through Mace∣donia
<HI>first.</HI> Now upon this head there exists
a circumstance of correspondency between
our epistle and the history, which is not
very obvious to the reader's observation;
but which, when observed, will be found,
I think, close and exact. Which circum∣stance
is this: that though the change of
St. Paul's intention be expressly mentioned
only in the second epistle, yet it appears,
both from the history and from this second
epistle, that the change had taken place
before the writing of the first epistle; that
it appears however from neither, otherwise
than by an inference, unnoticed perhaps by
almost every one who does not sit down
professedly to the examination.</P>
<P>First, then, how does this point appear
from the history? In the nineteenth chapter
of the Acts, and the twenty-first verse, we
are told, that "Paul purposed in the spirit,
when he had passed through Macedonia
and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem. So he
sent into Macedonia two of them that
<PB N="118" REF="120"/>
ministered unto him, Timotheus and Eras∣tus;
but he himself stayed in Asia for a
season." A short time after this, and evi∣dently
in pursuance of the same intention,
we find (chap. xx. ver. 1, 2) that "Paul
departed from Ephesus for to go into
Macedonia; and that, when he had gone
over those parts, he came into Greece."
The resolution therefore of passing first
through Macedonia, and from thence into
Greece, was formed by St. Paul previously
to the sending away of Timothy. The or∣der
in which the two countries are men∣tioned,
shews the direction of his intended
route, "when he had passed through Mace∣donia
and Achaia." Timothy and Erastus,
who were to precede him in his progress,
were sent by him from Ephesus into Mace∣donia.
He himself a short time afterwards,
and, as hath been observed, evidently in
continuation and pursuance of the same de∣sign,
"departed for to go into Macedonia."
If he had ever therefore entertained a diffe∣rent
plan of his journey, which is not hinted
in the history, he must have changed that
plan before this time. But, from the seven∣teenth
<PB N="119" REF="121"/>
verse of the fourth chapter of the first
Epistle to the Corinthians, we discover, that
Timothy had been sent away from Ephesus
before that epistle was written: "For this
cause have I sent unto you Timotheus,
who is my beloved son." The change
therefore of St. Paul's resolution, which was
prior to the sending away of Timothy, was
necessarily prior to the writing of the first
Epistle to the Corinthians.</P>
<P>Thus stands the order of dates, as collected
from the history, compared with the first
epistle. Now let us enquire, secondly, how
this matter is represented in the epistle be∣fore
us. In the sixteenth verse of the first
chapter of this epistle, St. Paul speaks of
the intention which he had once entertained
of visiting Achaia, in his way to Macedonia:
"In this confidence I was minded to come
unto you before, that ye might have a se∣cond
benefit; and to pass by you into
Macedonia." After protesting, in the se∣venteenth
verse, against any evil construc∣tion
that might be put upon his laying aside
of this intention, in the twenty-third verse
he discloses the cause of it: "Moreover I
<PB N="120" REF="122"/>
call God for a record upon my soul, that,
to spare you, I came not as yet unto Co∣rinth."
And then he proceeds as follows:
"But I determined this with myself, that
I would not come again to you in heavi∣ness;
for if I make you sorry, who is he
then that maketh me glad, but the same
which is made sorry by me? <HI>And I wrote
this same unto you,</HI> lest when I came I
should have sorrow from them of whom
I ought to rejoice; having confidence in
you all, that my joy is the joy of you all:
for, out of much affliction and anguish of
heart, <HI>I wrote unto you with many tears</HI>;
not that ye should be grieved, but that ye
might know the love which I have more
abundantly unto you; but if any have
caused grief, he hath not grieved me but
in part, that I may not overcharge you
all. Sufficient to such a man is this pu∣nishment,
which was inflicted of many."
In this quotation, let the reader first direct
his attention to the clause marked by Italics,
"and I wrote this same unto you;" and let
him consider, whether from the context, and
from the structure of the whole passage, it
<PB N="121" REF="123"/>
be not evident that this writing was after
St. Paul had "determined with himself, that
he would not come again to them in hea∣viness?"
whether, indeed, it was not in
consequence of this determination, or at least
with this determination upon his mind?
And, in the next place, let him consider,
whether the sentence, "I determined this
with myself, that I would not come again
to you in heaviness," do not plainly refer
to that postponing of his visit, to which he
had alluded in the verse but one before, when
he said, "I call God for a record upon my
soul, that, to spare you, I came not as yet
to Corinth;" and whether this be not the
visit of which he speaks in the sixteenth
verse, wherein he informs the Corinthians,
"that he had been minded to pass by them
into Macedonia;" but that, for reasons
which argued no levity or fickleness in his
disposition, he had been compelled to change
his purpose. If this be so, then it follows
that the writing here mentioned was poste∣rior
to the change of his intention. The
only question, therefore, that remains will
be, whether this writing relate to the letter
<PB N="122" REF="124"/>
which we now have under the title of the
first Epistle to the Corinthians, or to some
other letter not extant? And upon this ques∣tion
I think Mr. Locke's observation deci∣sive;
namely, that the second clause marked
in the quotation by Italics, "I wrote unto
you with many tears," and the first clause
so marked, "I wrote this same unto you,"
belong to one writing, whatever that was;
and that the second clause goes on to advert
to a circumstance which is found in our pre∣sent
first Epistle to the Corinthians; namely,
the case and punishment of the incestuous
person. Upon the whole then we see, that
it is capable of being inferred from St. Paul's
own words, in the long extract which we
have quoted, that the first Epistle to the Co∣rinthians
was written after St. Paul had de∣termined
to postpone his journey to Corinth;
in other words, that the change of his pur∣pose,
with respect to the course of his jour∣ney,
though expressly mentioned only in
the second epistle, had taken place before the
writing of the first; the point which we
made out to be implied in the history, by
the order of the events there recorded, and
<PB N="123" REF="125"/>
the allusions to those events in the first epi∣stle.
Now this is a species of congruity of
all others the most to be relied upon. It is
not an agreement between two accounts of
the same transaction, or between different
statements of the same fact, for the fact is
not stated; nothing that can be called an
account is given; but it is the junction of
two conclusions, deduced from independent
sources, and deducible only by investiga∣tion
and comparison.</P>
<P>This point, viz. the change of the route,
being prior to the writing of the first epistle,
also falls in with, and accounts for, the man∣ner
in which he speaks in that epistle of his
journey. His first intention had been, as he
here declares, to "pass by them into Mace∣donia;"
that intention having been previ∣ously
given up, he writes, in his first epistle,
"that he would not see them now by the
way," i. e. as he must have done upon his
first plan; "but that he trusted to tarry
awhile with them, and possibly to abide,
yea and winter with them" (1 Cor. chap.
xvi. ver. 5, 6). It also accounts for a singula∣rity
in the text referred to, which must strike
<PB N="124" REF="126"/>
every reader: "I will come to you when I
pass through Macedonia; for I do pass
through Macedonia." The supplemental
sentence, "for I do pass through Macedonia,"
imports that there had been some previous
communication upon the subject of the jour∣ney;
and also that there had been some vacil∣lation
and indecisiveness in the apostle's plan;
both which we now perceive to have been
the case. The sentence is as much as to say,
"this is what I at last resolve upon." The
expression "<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>," is ambi∣guous;
it may denote either "when I pass,
or when I shall have passed, through Ma∣cedonia:"
the considerations offered above
fix it to the latter sense. Lastly, the point we
have endeavoured to make out, confirms, or
rather indeed is necessary to the support of a
conjecture, which forms the subject of a
number in our observations upon the first
epistle, that the insinuation of certain of the
church of Corinth, that he would come no
more amongst them, was founded in some
previous disappointment of their expecta∣tions.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="5" TYPE="section">
<PB N="125" REF="127"/>
<HEAD>No. V.</HEAD>
<P>But if St. Paul had changed his purpose
before the writing of the first epistle, why
did he defer explaining himself to the Co∣rinthians,
concerning the reason of that
change, until he wrote the second? This
is a very fair question; and we are able, I
think, to return to it a satisfactory answer.
The real cause, and the cause at length as∣signed
by St. Paul for postponing his visit
to Corinth, and not travelling by the route
which he had at first designed, was the dis∣orderly
state of the Corinthian church at the
time, and the painful severities which he
should have found himself obliged to exer∣cise,
if he had come amongst them during
the existence of these irregularities. He
was willing therefore to try, before he came
in person, what a letter of authoritative ob∣jurgation
would do amongst them, and to
leave time for the operation of the experi∣ment.
That was his scheme in writing the
first epistle. But it was not for him to ac∣quaint
them with the scheme. After the
epistle had produced its effect (and to the
<PB N="126" REF="128"/>
utmost extent, as it should seem of the apo∣stle's
hopes); when it had wrought in them
a deep sense of their fault, and an almost
passionate solicitude to restore themselves to
the approbation of their teacher; when Ti∣tus
(chap. vii. ver. 6, 7, 11) had brought him
intelligence "of their earnest desire, their
mourning, their fervent mind towards him,
of their sorrow and their penitence; what
carefulness, what clearing of themselves,
what indignation, what fear, what ve∣hement
desire, what zeal, what revenge,"
his letter, and the general concern occa∣sioned
by it, had excited amongst them;
he then opens himself fully upon the sub∣ject.
The affectionate mind of the apostle
is touched by this return of zeal and duty.
He tells them that he did not visit them at
the time proposed, lest their meeting should
have been attended with mutual grief; and
with grief to him embittered by the reflec∣tion,
that he was giving pain to those, from
whom alone he could receive comfort: "I

me glad but the same which is made

he had written his former epistle to warn
them beforehand of their fault, "lest when
he came he should have sorrow of them
of whom he ought to rejoice" (chap. ii.
ver. 3); that he had the farther view, though
perhaps unperceived by them, of making
an experiment of their fidelity, "to know
the proof of them, whether they were obe∣dient
in all things" (chap. ii. ver. 9). This
full discovery of his motive came very natu∣rally
from the apostle, after he had seen the
success of his measures, but would not have
been a seasonable communication before. The
whole composes a train of sentiment and of
conduct resulting from real situation, and
from real circumstance, and as remote as
possible from fiction or imposture.</P>

<PB N="128" REF="130"/>
forth in this passage, the arrival at Corinth
of brethren from Macedonia during St. Paul's
first residence in that city, is explicitly re∣corded,
Acts, chap. xviii. ver. 1, 5: "After

<P>The above quotation from the Acts proves
that Silas and Timotheus were assisting to
St. Paul in preaching the gospel at Corinth.
With which correspond the words of the
epistle (chap. i. ver. 19): "For the Son of
God, Jesus Christ, who was preached
among you by us, even by me, and Silvanus,
and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but
in him was yea." I do admit that the
correspondency, considered by itself, is too
direct and obvious; and that an impostor
with the history before him might, and pro∣bably
would, produce agreements of the same
kind. But let it be remembered, that this
reference is found in a writing, which from
<PB N="129" REF="131"/>
many discrepancies, and especially from those
noted No. II. we may conclude, was not
composed by any one who had consulted,
and who pursued the history. Some obser∣vation
also arises upon the variation of the
name. We read Silas in the Acts, Silvanus
in the epistle. The similitude of these two
names, if they were the names of different
persons, is greater than could easily have
proceeded from accident; I mean that it is
not probable, that two persons placed in situ∣ations
so much alike, should bear names so
nearly resembling each other<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That they were the same person is farther confirm∣ed by 1 Thess. chap. i. ver. 1, compared with Acts, chap. xvii. ver. 10.</NOTE>. On the other
hand, the difference of the name in the two
passages negatives the supposition of the
passages, or the account contained in them,
being transcribed either from the other.</P>

<P>Chap. ii. ver. 12, 13. "When I came
to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and
a door was opened unto me of the Lord,
<PB N="130" REF="132"/>
I had no rest in my spirit, because I found
not Titus, my brother; but taking my
leave of them, I went from thence into
Macedonia."</P>
<P>To establish a conformity between this
passage and the history, nothing more is ne∣cessary
to be presumed, than that St. Paul
proceeded from Ephesus to Macedonia, upon
the same course by which he came back from
Macedonia to Ephesus, or rather to Miletus
in the neighbourhood of Ephesus; in other
words, that, in his journey to the peninsula
of Greece, he went and returned the same
way. St. Paul is now in Macedonia, where
he had lately arrived from Ephesus. Our
quotation imports that in his journey he had
stopped at Troas. Of this, the history says
nothing, leaving us only the short account,
"that Paul departed from Ephesus, for to go
into Macedonia." But the history says,
that in his <HI>return</HI> from Macedonia to Ephe∣sus,
"Paul sailed from Philippi to <HI>Troas</HI>; and
that, when the disciples came together on
the first day of the week to break bread,
Paul preached unto them all night; that
from Troas he went by land to Assos, from
<PB N="131" REF="133"/>
Assos, taking ship and coasting along the
front of Asia Minor, he came by Mytelene
to Miletus." Which account proves, first,
that Troas lay in the way by which St. Paul
passed between Ephesus and Macedonia;
secondly, that he had disciples there. In
one journey between these two places, the
epistle, and in another journey between the
same places, the history makes him stop at
this city. Of the first journey he is made
to say, "that a door was in that city opened
unto him of the Lord;" in the second we
find disciples there collected around him, and
the apostle exercising his ministry, with,
what was even in him, more than ordinary
zeal and labour. The epistle therefore is in
this instance confirmed, if not by the terms,
at least by the probability of the history; a
species of consirmation by no means to be
despised, because, as far as it reaches, it is
evidently uncontrived.</P>
<P>Grotius, I know, refers the arrival at
Troas, to which the epistle alludes, to a dif∣ferent
period, but I think very improbably;
for nothing appears to me more certain, than
that the meeting with Titus, which St. Paul
<PB N="132" REF="134"/>
expected at Troas, was the same meeting
which took place in Macedonia, viz. upon
Titus's coming out of Greece. In the quo∣tation
before us, he tells the Corinthians,
"When I came to Troas, I had no rest in
my spirit, because I found not Titus, my
brother; but, taking my leave of them, I
went from thence into Macedonia." Then
in the seventh chapter he writes, "When
we were come into Macedonia our flesh
had no rest, but we were troubled on every
side; without were fightings, within were
fears; nevertheless God, that comforteth
them that are cast down, comforted us by
the coming of Titus." These two pas∣sages
plainly relate to the same journey of
Titus, in meeting with whom St. Paul had
been disappointed at Troas, and rejoiced in
Macedonia. And amongst other reasons
which fix the former passage to the coming
of Titus out of Greece, is the consideration,
that it was nothing to the Corinthians that
St. Paul did not meet with Titus at Troas,
were it not that he was to bring intelligence
from Corinth. The mention of the disap∣pointment
<PB N="133" REF="135"/>
in this place, upon any other
supposition, is irrelative.</P>

<P>Chap. xi. ver. 24, 25. "Of the Jews
five times received I forty stripes save one;
thrice was I beaten with rods; once was
I stoned; thrice I suffered shipwreck; a
night and a day I have been in the deep."</P>
<P>These particulars cannot be extracted out
of the Acts of the Apostles; which proves,
as hath been already observed, that the epi∣stle
was not framed from the history; yet
they are consistent with it, which, consider∣ing
how numerically circumstantial the ac∣count
is, is more than could happen to arbi∣trary
and independent fictions. When I
say that these particulars are <HI>consistent</HI> with
the history, I mean, first, that there is no
article in the enumeration which is contra∣dicted
by the history; secondly, that the
history, though silent with respect to many
of the facts here enumerated, has left space
for the existence of these facts, consistent
with the sidelity of its own narration.</P>
<P>First, no contradiction is discoverable be∣tween
<PB N="134" REF="136"/>
the epistle and the history. When
St. Paul says, <HI>thrice</HI> was I beaten with rods,
although the history record only <HI>one</HI> beating
with rods, viz. at Philippi, Acts, chap. xvi.
ver. 22, yet is there no contradiction. It
is only the omission in one book of what is
related in another. But had the history
contained accounts of <HI>four</HI> beatings with rods,
at the time of writing this epistle, in which
St. Paul says that he had only suffered <HI>three,</HI>
there would have been a contradiction pro∣perly
so called. The same observation ap∣plies
generally to the other parts of the
enumeration, concerning which the history
is silent: but there is one clause in the quo∣tation
particularly deserving of remark; be∣cause,
when confronted with the history, it
furnishes the nearest approach to a contra∣diction,
without a contradiction being ac∣tually
incurred, of any I remember to have
met with. "Once," saith St. Paul, "was
I stoned." Does the history relate that
St. Paul, prior to the writing of this epistle,
had been stoned more than once? The
history mentions distinctly one occasion up∣on
which St. Paul was stoned, viz. at Lys∣tra
<PB N="135" REF="137"/>
in Lycaonia. "Then came thither cer∣tain
Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who
persuaded the people; and, having stoned
Paul, drew him out of the city, supposing
he had been dead" (chap. xiv. ver. 19). And
it mentions also another occasion in which
"an assault was made both of the Gentiles,
and also of the Jews with their rulers, to
use them despitefully, and to stone them;
but they were aware of it," the history
proceeds to tell us, "and fled into Lystra
and Derbe." This happened at Iconium,
prior to the date of the epistle. Now had
the assault been completed; had the history
related that a stone was thrown, as it relates
that preparations were made both by Jews
and Gentiles to stone Paul and his com∣panions;
or even had the account of this
transaction stopped, without going on to
inform us that Paul and his companions
were "aware of their danger and sled," a
contradiction between the history and the
epistle would have ensued Truth is neces∣sarily
consistent; but it is scarcely possible
that independent accounts, not having truth
to guide them, should thus advance to the
<PB N="136" REF="138"/>
very brink of contradiction without falling
into it.</P>
<P>Secondly, I say, that if the Acts of the Apo∣stles
be silent concerning many of the instances
enumerated in the epistle, this silence may
be accounted for, from the plan and fabric
of the history. The date of the epistle syn∣chronises
with the beginning of the twentieth
chapter of the Acts. The part, therefore, of
the history, which precedes the twentieth
chapter, is the only part in which can be
found any notice of the persecutions to
which St. Paul refers. Now it does not ap∣pear
that the author of the history was with
St. Paul until his departure from Troas, on
his way to Macedonia, as related chap. xvi.
ver. 10; or rather indeed the contrary ap∣pears.
It is in this point of the history that
the language changes. In the seventh and
eighth verses of this chapter the third person
is used. "After <HI>they</HI> were come to Mysia,
<HI>they</HI> assayed to go into Bithynia, but the
spirit suffered them not; and <HI>they</HI> passing
by Mysia, came to Troas:" and the third
person is in like manner constantly used
throughout the foregoing part of the history.
<PB N="137" REF="139"/>
In the tenth verse of this chapter, the first
person comes in: "After Paul had seen the
vision, immediately <HI>we</HI> endeavoured to go
into Macedonia; assuredly gathering that
the Lord had called <HI>us</HI> to preach the gos∣pel
unto them." Now, from this time to
the writing of the epistle, the history occu∣pies
four chapters: yet it is in these, if in
any, that a regular or continued account of
the apostle's life is to be expected; for how
succinctly his history is delivered in the
preceding part of the book, that is to say,
from the time of his conversion to the time
when the historian joined him at Troas, ex∣cept
the particulars of his conversion it∣self
which are related circumstantially, may
be understood from the following observa∣tions.</P>
<P>The history of a period of sixteen years
is comprised in less than three chapters;
and of these, a material part is taken up with
discourses. After his conversion, he conti∣nued
in the neighbourhood of Damascus,
according to the history, for a certain con∣siderable,
though indefinite length of time,
according to his own words (Gal. ch. i. ver. 18),
<PB N="138" REF="140"/>
for three years; of which no other account
is given than this short one, that "straight∣way
he preached Christ in the synagogues,
that he is the Son of God; that all that heard
him were amazed, and said, Is not this he
that destroyed them which called on his
name in Jerusalem? that he increased the
more in strength, and confounded the Jews
which dwelt at Damascus; and that, after
many days were fulfilled, the Jews took coun∣sel
to kill him." From Damascus he pro∣ceeded
to Jerusalem; and of his residence
there nothing more particular is recorded,
than that "he was with the apostles, coming
in and going out; that he spake boldly in
the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed
against the Grecians who went about to
kill him." From Jerusalem, the history
sends him to his native city of Tarsus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts, chap. ix. ver. 30.</NOTE>.
It seems probable, from the order and dis∣position
of the history, that St. Paul's stay
at Tarsus was of some continuance; for we
hear nothing more of him, until, after a long
apparent interval, and much interjacent nar∣rative,
<PB N="139" REF="141"/>
Barnabas, desirous of Paul's assistance
upon the enlargement of the Christian mis∣sion,
"went to Tarsus for to seek him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. xi. ver. 25.</NOTE>."
We cannot doubt but that the new apostle
had been busied in his ministry; yet of
what he did, or what he suffered, during
this period, which may include three or four
years, the history professes not to deliver
any information. As Tarsus was situated
upon the sea coast, and as, though Tarsus was
his home, yet it is probable he visited from
thence many other places, for the purpose
of preaching the Gospel, it is not unlikely,
that in the course of three or four years,
he might undertake many short voyages to
neighbouring countries, in the navigating of
which we may be allowed to suppose that
some of those disasters and shipwrecks befel
him, to which he refers in the quotation
before us, "thrice I suffered shipwreck, a
night and a day I have been in the deep."
This last clause I am inclined to interpret of
his being obliged to take to an open boat,
upon the loss of the ship, and his continuing
<PB N="140" REF="142"/>
out at sea in that dangerous situation, a
night and a day. St. Paul is here recounting
his sufferings, not relating miracles. From
Tarsus, Barnabas brought Paul to Antioch,
and there he remained a year; but of the
transactions of that year no other description
is given than what is contained in the four
last verses of the eleventh chapter. After a
more solemn dedication to the ministry,
Barnabas and Paul proceeded from Antioch
to Cilicia, and from thence they sailed to
Cyprus, of which voyage no particulars are
mentioned. Upon their return from Cyprus,
they made a progress together through the
Lesser Asia; and though two remarkable
speeches be preserved, and a few incidents
in the course of their travels circumstan∣tially
related, yet is the account of this
progress, upon the whole, given profes∣sedly
with conciseness: for instance, at Ico∣nium
it is said that they abode a long
time<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. xiv. ver. 3.</NOTE>; yet of this long abode, except con∣cerning
the manner in which they were
driven away, no memoir is inserted in the
<PB N="141" REF="143"/>
history. The whole is wrapped up in one
short summary, "they spake boldly in the
Lord, which gave testimony unto the word
of his grace, and granted signs and won∣ders
to be done by their hands." Having
completed their progress, the two apostles
returned to Antioch, "and there they abode
long time with the disciples." Here we
have another large portion of time passed
over in silence. To this succeeded a journey
to Jerusalem, upon a dispute which then
much agitated the Christian church, concern∣ing
the obligation of the law of Moses.
When the object of that journey was com∣pleted,
Paul proposed to Barnabas to go
again and visit their brethren in every city
where they had preached the word of the
Lord. The execution of this plan carried
our apostle through Syria, Cilicia, and many
provinces of the Lesser Asia; yet is the ac∣count
of the whole journey dispatched, in
four verses of the sixteenth chapter.</P>
<P>If the Acts of the Apostles had under∣taken
to exhibit regular annals of St. Paul's
ministry, or even any continued account of
his life, from his conversion at Damascus
<PB N="142" REF="144"/>
to his imprisonment at Rome, I should have
thought the omission of the circumstances
referred to in our epistle, a matter of rea∣sonable
objection. But when it appears,
from the history itself, that large portions
of St. Paul's life were either passed over in
silence, or only slightly touched upon, and
that nothing more than certain detached in∣cidents
and discourses are related; when we
observe also, that the author of the history
did not join our apostle's society till a few
years before the writing of the epistle, at
least that there is no proof in the history
that he did so; in comparing the history
with the epistle, we shall not be surprised by
the discovery of omissions; we shall ascribe
it to truth that there is no contradiction.</P>

<P>Chap. iii. ver. 1. "Do we begin again
to commend ourselves; or need we, as
some others, epistles of commendation to
you?"</P>
<P>"As some others." Turn to Acts xviii. 27,
and you will find that, a short time before
the writing of this epistle, Apollos had gone
<PB N="143" REF="145"/>
to Corinth with letters of commendations
from the Ephesian Christians; "and when
Apollos was disposed to pass into Achaia,
the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples
to receive him." Here the words of the
epistle bear the appearance of alluding to
some specific instance, and the history supplies
that instance; it supplies at least an instance
as opposite as possible to the terms which the
apostle uses, and to the date and direction
of the epistle, in which they are found. The
letter which Apollos carried from Ephesus,
was precisely the letter of commendation
which St. Paul meant; and it was to Achaia
of which Corinth was the capital, and indeed
to Corinth itself (Acts, chap. xix. ver. 1),
that Apollos carried it; and it was about
two years before the writing of this epistle.
If St. Paul's words be rather thought to refer
to some general usage which then obtained
among Christian churches, the case of Apol∣los
exemplisies that usage; and affords that
species of confirmation to the epistle, which
arises from seeing the manners of the age,
in which it purports to be written, faithfully
preserved.</P>

<P>Do not these words import that the writer
had been at Corinth twice before? yet, if
they import this, they overset every con∣gruity
we have been endeavouring to esta∣blish.
The Acts of the Apostles record only
two journeys of St. Paul to Corinth. We
have all along supposed, what every mark
of time except this expression indicates, that
the epistle was written between the first and
second of these journeys. If St. Paul had
been already twice at Corinth, this supposi∣tion
must be given up; and every argument
or observation which depends upon it, falls
to the ground. Again, the Acts of the
Apostles not only record no more than two
journeys of St. Paul to Corinth, but do not
allow us to suppose that more than two such
journeys could be made or intended by him
within the period which the history com∣prises;
for, from his first journey into
Greece to his first imprisonment at Rome,
<PB N="145" REF="147"/>
with which the history concludes, the apo∣stle's
time is accounted for. If therefore the
epistle was written after the second journey
to Corinth, and upon the view and expecta∣tion
of a third, it must have been written
after his first imprisonment at Rome, <HI>i. e.</HI>
after the time to which the history extends.
When I first read over this epistle with the
particular view of comparing it with the
history, which I chose to do without con∣sulting
any commentary whatever, I own
that I felt myself confounded by this text.
It appeared to contradict the opinion, which
I had been led by a great variety of cir∣cumstances
to form, concerning the date and
occasion of the epistle. At length however
it occurred to my thoughts to enquire, whe∣ther
the passage did necessarily imply that
St. Paul had been at Corinth twice; or
whether, when he says "this is the third
time I am coming to you," he might mean
only that this was the third time that he
was ready, that he was prepared, that he
intended to set out upon his journey to
Corinth. I recollected that he had once
before this purposed to visit Corinth, and
<PB N="146" REF="148"/>
had been disappointed in his purpose; which
disappointment forms the subject of much
apology and protestation, in the first and
second chapters of the epistle. Now, if the
journey in which he had been disappointed
was reckoned by him one of the times in
which "he was coming to them," then the
present would be the third time, <HI>i. e.</HI> of
his being ready and prepared to come; al∣though
he had been actually at Corinth only
<HI>once</HI> before. This conjecture being taken
up, a farther examination of the passage and
the epistle, produced proofs which placed it
beyond doubt. "This is the third time I
am coming to you:" in the verse following
these words he adds, "I told you before,
and foretel you, as if I were present <HI>the
second time</HI>; and being absent, now I write
to them which heretofore have sinned,
and to all other, that if I come again, I
will not spare." In this verse, the apostle
is declaring beforehand what he would do
in his intended visit: His expression there∣fore,
"as if I were present the second time,"
relates to that visit. But, if his future visit
would only make him present amongst them
<PB N="147" REF="149"/>
a second time, it follows that he had been al∣ready
there but once. Again, in the fifteenth
verse of the first chapter, he tells them,
"In this confidence, I was minded to come
unto you before, that you might have a
<HI>second</HI> benefit." Why a second, and not a
third benefit? why <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and not <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
if the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, in the fifteenth
chapter, meant a <HI>third</HI> visit? for, though
the visit in the first chapter be that visit in
which he was disappointed, yet, as it is
evident from the epistle that he had never
been at Corinth, from the time of the dis∣appointment
to the time of writing the
epistle, it follows, that if it was only a second
visit in which he was disappointed then, it
could only be a second visit which he pro∣posed
now. But the text which I think
is decisive of the question, if any question
remain upon the subject, is the fourteenth
verse of the twelfth chapter: "Behold the
third time I am ready to come to you"
(<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>). It is very
clear that the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> of the
twelfth chapter, and the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
of the thirteenth chapter, are equivalent ex∣pressions,
<PB N="148" REF="150"/>
were intended to convey the same
meaning, and to relate to the same journey.
The comparison of these phrases gives us
St. Paul's own explanation of his own
words; and it is that very explanation which
we are contending for, viz. that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
does not mean that he was coming
a third time, but that this was the third time
he was in readiness to come, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.
I do not apprehend, that after this
it can be necessary to call to our aid the
reading of the Alexandrian manuscript,
which gives <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in the thir∣teenth
chapter as well as in the twelfth; or
of the Syriac and Coptic versions, which
follow that reading; because I allow that
this reading, besides not being sufficiently
supported by ancient copies, is probably
paraphrastical, and has been inserted for the
purpose of expressing more unequivocally
the sense, which the shorter expression <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
was supposed to carry. Upon
the whole, the matter is sufficiently certain;
nor do I propose it as a new interpretation
of the text which contains the difficulty,
for the same was given by Grotius long
<PB N="149" REF="151"/>
ago; but I thought it the clearest way of
explaining the subject, to describe the man∣ner
in which the difficulty, the solution,
and the proofs of that solution, successive∣ly
presented themselves to my enquiries.
Now, in historical researches, a reconciled
inconsistency becomes a positive argument.
First, because an impostor generally guards
against the appearance of inconsistency; and
secondly, because, when apparent incon∣sistencies
are found, it is seldom that any
thing but truth renders them capable of re∣conciliation.
The existence of the difficulty
proves the want or absence of that caution,
which usually accompanies the consciousness
of fraud; and the solution proves, that it is
not the collision of fortuitous propositions
which we have to deal with, but that a thread
of truth winds through the whole, which
preserves every circumstance in its place.</P>

<P>Chap. x. ver. 14-16. "We are come
as far as to you also, in preaching the
Gospel of Christ; not boasting of things
without our measure, that is, of other
<PB N="150" REF="152"/>
men's labours; but having hope, when
your faith is increased, that we shall be
enlarged by you, according to our rule,
abundantly to preach the Gospel in the
regions beyond you."</P>
<P>This quotation affords an indirect, and
therefore unsuspicious, but at the same time
a distinct and indubitable recognition of the
truth and exactness of the history. I con∣sider
it to be implied by the words of the
quotation, that Corinth was the extremity
of St. Paul's travels <HI>hitherto.</HI> He expresses
to the Corinthians his hope, that in some
future visit he might "preach the Gospel to
the regions beyond them;" which imports
that he had not hitherto proceeded "beyond
them," but that Corinth was as yet the
farthest point or boundary of his travels.
Now, how is St. Paul's first journey into
Europe, which was the only one he had
taken before the writing of the epistle,
traced out in the history? Sailing from Asia,
he landed at Philippi; from Philippi, tra∣versing
the eastern coast of the peninsula,
he passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia
to Thessalonica; from thence through Berea
<PB N="151" REF="153"/>
to Athens, and from Athens to Corinth,
<HI>where he stopped</HI>; and from whence, after a
residence of a year and a half, he sailed back
into Syria. So that Corinth was the last
place which he visited in the peninsula; was
the place from which he returned into Asia;
and was, as such, the boundary and limit of
his progress. He could not have said the
same thing, viz. "I hope hereafter to visit
the regions beyond you," in an epistle to
the Philippians, or in an epistle to the Thes∣salonians,
inasmuch as he must be deemed
to have already visited the regions beyond
<HI>them,</HI> having proceeded from those cities to
other parts of Greece. But from Corinth
he returned home; every part therefore,
beyond that city, might properly be said,
as it is said in the passage before us, to
be unvisited. Yet is this propriety, the
spontaneous effect of truth, and produced
without meditation or design.</P>

<P>THE argument of this epistle in some
measure proves its antiquity. It
will hardly be doubted, but that it was writ∣ten
whilst the dispute concerning the cir∣cumcision
of Gentile converts was fresh in
men's minds; for, even supposing it to have
been a forgery, the only credible motive that
can be assigned for the forgery, was to bring
the name and authority of the apostle into
this controversy. No design could be so
insipid, or so unlikely to enter into the
thoughts of any man, as to produce an
epistle written earnestly and pointedly upon
one side of a controversy, when the contro∣versy
itself was dead, and the question no
longer interesting to any description of read∣ers
whatever. Now the controversy con∣cerning
the circumcision of the Gentile
<PB N="153" REF="155"/>
Christians was of such a nature, that, if it
arose at all, it must have arisen in the begin∣ning
of Christianity. As Judaea was the
scene of the Christian history; as the author
and preachers of Christianity were Jews; as
the religion itself acknowledged and was
founded upon the Jewish religion, in contra∣distinction
to every other religion then pro∣fessed
amongst mankind; it was not to be
wondered at, that some of its teachers should
carry it out in the world rather as a sect and
modification of Judaism, than as a separate,
original revelation; or that they should invite
their proselytes to those observances, in which
they lived themselves. This was likely to
happen: but if it did not happen <HI>at first</HI>; if,
whilst the religion was in the hands of Jewish
teachers, no such claim was advanced, no
such condition was attempted to be imposed;
it is not probable that the doctrine would
be started, much less that it should prevail
in any future period. I likewise think, that
those pretensions of Judaism were much
more likely to be insisted upon, whilst the
Jews continued a nation, than after their
fall and dispersion; whilst Jerusalem and
<PB N="154" REF="156"/>
the temple stood, than after the destruction
brought upon them by the Roman arms,
the fatal cessation of the sacrifice and the
priesthood, the humiliating loss of their
country, and, with it, of the great rites and
symbols of their institution. It should seem
therefore, from the nature of the subject,
and the situation of the parties, that this
controversy was carried on in the interval
between the preaching of Christianity to the
Gentiles, and the invasion of Titus; and that
our present epistle, which was undoubtedly
intended to bear a part in this controversy,
must be referred to the same period.</P>
<P>But, again, the epistle supposes that cer∣tain
designing adherents of the Jewish law had
crept into the churches of Galatia; and had
been endeavouring, and but too successfully,
to persuade the Galatic converts, that they
had been taught the new religion imperfectly
and at second hand; that the founder of
their church himself possessed only an infe∣rior
and deputed commission, the seat of
truth and authority being in the apostles
and elders of Jerusalem; moreover, that
whatever he might profess amongst them,
<PB N="155" REF="157"/>
he had himself at other times, and in other
places, given way to the doctrine of cir∣cumcision.—The
epistle is unintelligible
without supposing all this. Referring there∣fore
to this, as to what had actually passed,
we find St. Paul treating so unjust an at∣tempt
to undermine his credit, and to intro∣duce
amongst his converts a doctrine which
he had uniformly reprobated, in terms of
great asperity and indignation. And in or∣der
to refute the suspicions which had been
raised concerning the fidelity of his teach∣ing,
as well as to assert the independency
and divine original of his mission, we find
him appealing to the history of his conver∣sion,
to his conduct under it, to the man∣ner
in which he had conferred with the apo∣stles
when he met with them at Jerusalem;
alledging, that so far was his doctrine from
being derived from them, or they from ex∣ercising
any superiority over him, that they
had simply assented to what he had already
preached amongst the Gentiles, and which
preaching was communicated not by them
to him, but by himself to them; that he
had maintained the liberty of the Gentile
<PB N="156" REF="158"/>
church, by opposing, upon one occasion, an
apostle to the face, when the timidity of
his behaviour seemed to endanger it; that
from the first, that all along, that to that
hour, he had constantly resisted the claims
of Judaism; and that the persecutions which
he daily underwent, at the hands or by the
instigation of the Jews, and of which he
bore in his person the marks and scars, might
have been avoided by him, if he had con∣sented
to employ his labours in bringing,
through the medium of christianity, converts
over to the Jewish institution, for then
"would the offence of the cross have ceased."
Now an impostor who had forged the epi∣stle
for the purpose of producing St. Paul's
authority in the dispute, which, as hath been
observed, is the only credible motive that
can be assigned for the forgery, might have
made the apostle deliver his opinion upon
the subject, in strong and decisive terms, or
might have put his name to a train of rea∣soning
and argumentation upon that side of
the question, which the imposture was in∣tended
to recommend. I can allow the pos∣sibility
of such a scheme as that. But for a
<PB N="157" REF="159"/>
writer, with this purpose in view, to feign a
series of transactions supposed to have passed
amongst the Christians of Galatia, and then
to counterfeit expressions of anger and re∣sentment
excited by these transactions; to
make the apostle travel back into his own
history, and into a recital of various passages
of his life, some indeed directly, but others
obliquely, and others even obscurely bearing
upon the point in question; in a word, to
substitute narrative for argument, expostu∣lation
and complaint for dogmatic positions
and controversial reasoning, in a writing pro∣perly
controversial, and of which the aim
and design was to support one side of a much
agitated question—is a method so intricate,
and so unlike the methods pursued by all
other impostors, as to require very flagrant
proofs of imposition to induce us to believe
it to be one.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>No. II.</HEAD>
<P>In this number I shall endeavour to
prove,</P>
<P N="1">1. That the Epistle to the Galatians, and
the Acts of the Apostles, were written with∣out
any communication with each other.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="158" REF="160"/>
2. That the epistle, though written with∣out
any communication with the history, by
recital, implication, or reference, bears testi∣mony
to many of the facts contained in it.</P>
<P>I. The epistle and the Acts of the Apo∣stles
were written without any communica∣tion
with each other.</P>
<P>To judge of this point, we must examine
those passages in each, which describe the
same transaction; for if the author of ei∣ther
writing derived his information from the
account which he had seen in the other,
when he came to speak of the same transac∣tion,
he would follow that account. The
history of St. Paul, at Damascus, as read
in the Acts, and as referred to by the epi∣stle,
forms an instance of this sort. Ac∣cording
to the Acts, Paul (after his conver∣sion)
was certain days with the "disciples
which were at Damascus; and straight-way
he preached Christ in the synagogues,
that he is the son of God. But all that
heard him were amazed, and said, is not
this he which destroyed them which called
on this name in Jerusalem, and came hi∣ther
for that intent, that he might bring
<PB N="159" REF="161"/>
them bound unto the chief priests? But
Saul increased the more in strength, con∣founding
the Jews which were at Damas∣cus,
proving that this is the very Christ.
And after many days were fulfilled, the
Jews took counsel to kill him; but their
laying in wait was known of Saul, and they
watched the gates day and night to kill him;
then the disciples took him by night, and
let him down by the wall in a basket; and
when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he as∣sayed
to join himself to the disciples."
Acts, chap. ix. ver. 19-26.</P>
<P>According to the epistle, "when it pleased
God, who separated me from my mother's
womb, and called me by his grace, to re∣veal
his own son in me, that I might preach
him among the heathen, immediately I
conferred not with flesh and blood, neither
went I up to Jerusalem to them which
were apostles before me: but I went into
Arabia, and returned again to Damascus;
then, after three years, I went up to Je∣rusalem."</P>
<P>Beside the difference observable in the
terms and general complexion of these two
<PB N="160" REF="162"/>
accounts, "the journey into Arabia," men∣tioned
in the epistle, and omitted in the his∣tory,
affords full proof that there existed no
correspondence between these writers. If
the narrative in the Acts had been made up
from the epistle, it is impossible that this
journey should have been passed over in
silence; if the epistle had been composed
out of what the author had read of St. Paul's
history in the Acts, it is unaccountable that
it should have been inserted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">N. B. The Acts of the Apostles simply inform us that St. Paul left Damascus in order to go to Jerusalem, "after many days were fulfilled." If any one doubt whether the words "many days" could be intended to express a period which included a term of three years, he will find a complete instance of the same phrase used with the same latitude in the first book of Kings, chap. xi. ver. 38, 39: "And Shimei dwelt at Jerusalem <HI>many days</HI>; and it came to pass, at the end of <HI>three years,</HI> that two of the servants of Shimei ran away."</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The journey to Jerusalem related in the se∣cond
chapter of the epistle ("then, fourteen
years after, I went up again to Jerusalem") sup∣plies
another example of the same kind. Either
this was the journey described in the fifteenth
chapter of the Acts, when Paul and Barna∣bas
<PB N="161" REF="163"/>
were sent from Antioch to Jerusalem,
to consult the apostles and elders upon the
question of the Gentile converts; or it was
some journey of which the history does not
take notice. If the first opinion be followed,
the discrepancy in the two accounts is so
considerable, that it is not without difficulty
they can be adapted to the same transaction:
so that, upon this supposition, there is no
place for suspecting that the writers were
guided or assisted by each other. If the lat∣ter
opinion be preferred, we have then a
journey to Jerusalem, and a conference with
the principal members of the church there,
circumstantially related in the epistle, and
entirely omitted in the Acts: and we are
at liberty to repeat the observation, which
we before made, that the omission of so ma∣terial
a fact in the history is inexplicable, if
the historian had read the epistle; and that
the insertion of it in the epistle, if the wri∣ter
derived his information from the history,
is not less so.</P>
<P>St. Peter's visit to Antioch, during which
the dispute arose between him and St. Paul,
is not mentioned in the Acts.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="164"/>
If we connect, with these instances, the
general observation, that no scrutiny can dis∣cover
the smallest trace of transcription or
imitation either in things or words, we shall
be fully satisfied in this part of our case;
namely, that the two records, be the facts
contained in them true or false, come to our
hands from independent sources.</P>
<P>Secondly, I say that the epistle, thus
proved to have been written without any
communication with the history, bears tes∣timony
to a great variety of particulars con∣tained
in the history.</P>
<P N="1">1. St. Paul in the early part of his life had
addicted himself to the study of the Jewish
religion, and was distinguished by his zeal
for the institution and for the traditions
which had been incorporated with it. Up∣on
this part of his character the history
makes St. Paul speak thus: "I am verily a
man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a
city of Cilicia, yet brought up in this city
at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught accord∣ing
to the perfect manner of the law of
the fathers; and was zealous towards God,
<PB N="163" REF="165"/>
as ye all are this day." Acts, chap. xxii.
ver. 3.</P>
<P>The epistle as follows: "I profited in
the Jews religion above many my equals
in mine own nation, being more exceed∣ingly
zealous of the traditions of my fa∣thers."
Chap. i. ver. 14.</P>
<P N="2">2. St. Paul, before his conversion, had
been a fierce persecutor of the new sect.
"As for Saul, he made havoc of the church;
entering into every house, and haling
men and women, committed them to pri∣son."
Acts, chap. vii. ver. 3.</P>
<P>This is the history of St. Paul, as deliver∣ed
in the Acts; in the recital of his own
history in the epistle, "Ye have heard,"
says he, "of my conversation in times past
in the Jews religion, how that beyond
measure I persecuted the church of God."
Chap. i. ver. 13.</P>
<P N="3">3. St. Paul was miraculously converted on
his way to Damascus. "And as he jour∣neyed
he came near to Damascus: and sud∣denly
there shined round about him a light
from heaven; and he fell to the earth, and
heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul,
<PB N="164" REF="166"/>
why persecutest thou me? And he said,
Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said,
I am Jesus, whom thou persecutest: it is
hard for thee to kick against the pricks.
And he, trembling and astonished, said,
Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?"
Acts, chap. ix. ver. 3-6. With this com∣pare
the epistle, chap. i. ver. 15-17:
"When it pleased God, who separated me
from my mother's womb, and called me
by his grace to reveal his son in me, that
I might preach him among the heathen;
immediately I conferred not with flesh
and blood, neither went I up to Jerusa∣lem,
to them that were apostles before
me; but I went into Arabia, and returned
again unto Damascus."</P>
<P>In this quotation from the epistle, I desire
it to be remarked how incidentally it appears,
that the affair passed at <HI>Damascus.</HI> In what
may be called the direct part of the account,
no mention is made of the place of his con∣version
at all; a casual expression at the
end, and an expression brought in for a dif∣ferent
purpose, alone fixes it to have been
at Damascus: "I returned again to Damas∣cus."
<PB N="165" REF="167"/>
Nothing can be more like simplicity
and undesignedness than this is. It also draws
the agreement between the two quotations
somewhat closer, to observe that they both
state St. Paul to have preached the gospel
immediately upon his call: "And straight∣way
he preached Christ in the synagogues,
that he is the son of God." Acts, chap. ix.
ver. 20. "When it pleased God to reveal
his son in me, that I might preach him
among the heathen, immediately I con∣ferred
not with flesh and blood." Gal.
chap. i. ver. 15.</P>
<P N="4">4. The course of the apostle's travels after
his conversion was this:—He went from Da∣mascus
to Jerusalem, and from Jerusalem
into Syria and Cilicia. "At Damascus the
disciples took him by night, and let him
down by the wall in a basket; and when
Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed
to join himself to the disciples" (Acts,
chap. ix. ver. 25). Afterwards, "when
the brethren knew the conspiracy formed
against him at Jerusalem, they brought
him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth
to Tarsus, a city in Cilicia" (chap. ix.
<PB N="166" REF="168"/>
ver. 30). In the epistle, St. Paul gives
the following brief account of his proceed∣ings
within the same period: "After three
years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter,
and abode with him fifteen days; after∣wards
I came into the regions of Syria and
Cilicia." The history had told us that
Paul passed from Caesarea to Tarsus: if he
took this journey by land, it would carry
him through Syria into Cilicia; and he would
come, after his visit at Jerusalem, "into the
regions of Syria and Cilicia," in the very
order in which he mentions them in the
epistle. This supposition of his going from
Caesarea to Tarsus <HI>by land,</HI> clears up also ano∣ther
point. It accounts for what St. Paul
says in the same place concerning the churches
of Judea: "Afterwards I came into the
regions of Syria and Cilicia, and was un∣known
by face unto the churches of Judea,
which were in Christ: but they had heard
only that he which persecuted us in times
past, now preacheth the faith, which once
he destroyed; and they glorified God in
me." Upon which passage I observe, first,
that what is here said of the churches of
<PB N="167" REF="169"/>
Judea, is spoken in connection with his
journey into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
Secondly, that the passage itself has little sig∣nificancy,
and that the <HI>connection</HI> is inexpli∣cable,
unless St. Paul went through Judea<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Doddridge thought that the Caesarea here men∣tioned was not the celebrated city of that name upon the Mediterranean sea, but Caesarea Philippi, near the borders of Syria, which lies in a much more direct line from Jerusalem to Tarsus than the other. The objec∣tion to this, Dr. Benson remarks, is, that Caesarea, without any addition, usually denotes Caesarea Pales∣tinae.</NOTE>
(though probably by a hasty journey) at
the time that he came into the regions of
Syria and Cilicia. Suppose him to have
passed by land from Caesarea to Tarsus, all
this, as hath been observed, would be pre∣cisely
true.</P>
<P N="5">5. Barnabas was with Paul at Antioch.
"Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to
seek Saul; and when he had found him,
he brought him unto Antioch. And it
came to pass that a whole year they assem∣bled
themselves with the church." Acts,
chap. xi. ver. 25, 26. Again, and upon
another occasion, "they (Paul and Barnabas)
<PB N="168" REF="170"/>
sailed to Antioch; and there they conti∣nued
a long time with the disciples." Chap.
xiv. ver. 26.</P>
<P>Now what says the epistle? "When Peter
was come to Antioch, I withstood him to
the face, because he was to be blamed;
and the other Jews dissembled likewise
with him; insomuch that Barnabas also
was carried away with their dissimula∣tion."
Chap. ii. ver. 11. 13.</P>
<P N="6">6. The stated residence of the apostles was
at Jerusalem. "At that time there was a
great persecution against the church which
was at Jerusalem; and they were all scat∣tered
abroad throughout the regions of
Judea and Samaria, except the apostles"
(Acts, chap. viii. ver. 1). "They (the Chris∣tians
at Antioch) determined that Paul
and Barnabas should go up to Jerusalem,
unto the apostles and elders, about this
question" (Acts, chap. xv. ver. 2). With
these accounts agrees the declaration in the
epistle: "Neither went I up to Jerusalem
to them which were apostles before me"
(chap. i. ver. 17): for this declaration im∣plies,
or rather assumes it to be known, that
<PB N="169" REF="171"/>
Jerusalem was the place where the apostles
were to be met with.</P>
<P N="7">7. There were at Jerusalem two apostles,
or at the least two eminent members of the
church, of the name of James. This is di∣rectly
inferred from the Acts of the Apostles,
which in the second verse of the twelfth
chapter relates the death of James, the bro∣ther
of John; and yet in the fifteenth chap∣ter,
and in a subsequent part of the history,
records a speech delivered by James in the
assembly of the apostles and elders. It is
also strongly implied by the form of expres∣sion
used in the epistle: "Other apostles saw
I none, save James, the <HI>Lord's brother</HI>;"
<HI>i. e.</HI> to distinguish him from James the bro∣ther
of John.</P>
<P>To us who have been long conversant in
the Christian history, as contained in the
Acts of the Apostles, these points are obvious
and familiar; nor do we readily apprehend
any greater difficulty in making them appear
in a letter purporting to have been written by
St. Paul, than there is in introducing them into
a modern sermon. But, to judge correctly of
the argument before us, we must discharge
<PB N="170" REF="172"/>
this knowledge from our thoughts. We must
propose to ourselves the situation of an
author who sat down to the writing of the
epistle without having seen the history; and
then the concurrences we have deduced will
be deemed of importance. They will at least
be taken for separate confirmations of the
several facts: and not only of these parti∣cular
facts, but of the general truth of the
history.</P>
<P>For what is the rule with respect to cor∣roborative
testimony which prevails in courts
of justice, and which prevails only because
experience has proved that it is an useful
guide to truth? A principal witness in a
cause delivers his account: his narrative, in
certain parts of it, is confirmed by witnesses
who are called afterwards. The credit de∣rived
from their testimony belongs not only
to the particular circumstances in which the
auxiliary witnesses agree with the principal
witness, but in some measure to the whole
of his evidence; because it is improbable
that accident or fiction should draw a
line which touched upon truth in so many
points.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="173"/>
In like manner, if two records be produced,
manifestly independent, that is, manifestly
written without any participation of intelli∣gence,
an agreement between them, even in
few and slight circumstances (especially if,
from the different nature and design of the
writings, few points only of agreement, and
those incidental, could be expected to occur)
would add a sensible weight to the authority
of both, in every part of their contents.</P>
<P>The same rule is applicable to history,
with at least as much reason as any other
species of evidence.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>No. III.</HEAD>
<P>But although the references to various par∣ticulars
in the epistle, compared with the di∣rect
account of the same particulars in the
history, afford a considerable proof of the
truth not only of these particulars, but of
the narrative which contains them; yet they
do not shew, it will be said, that the epistle was
written by St. Paul: for admitting (what seems
to have been proved) that the writer, whoever
he was, had no recourse to the Acts of the Apo∣stles,
<PB N="172" REF="174"/>
yet many of the facts referred to, such as
St. Paul's miraculous conversion, his change
from a virulent persecutor to an indefatigable
preacher, his labours amongst the Gentiles,
and his zeal for the liberties of the Gentile
church, were so notorious, as to occur rea∣dily
to the mind of any Christian, who
should choose to personate his character, and
counterfeit his name: it was only to write
what every body knew. Now I think that
this supposition—viz. that the epistle was
composed upon general information, and the
general publicity of the facts alluded to, and
that the author did no more than weave into
his work what the common fame of the
Christian church had reported to his ears—is
repelled by the particularity of the recitals
and references. This particularity is obser∣vable
in the following instances; in perusing
which, I desire the reader to reflect, whether
they exhibit the language of a man who had
nothing but general reputation to proceed
upon, or of a man actually speaking of him∣self
and of his own history, and consequently
of things concerning which he possessed a
<PB N="173" REF="175"/>
clear, intimate, and circumstantial know∣ledge.</P>
<P N="1">1. The history, in giving an account of
St. Paul after his conversion, relates "that,
after many days," effecting, by the assistance
of the disciples, his escape from Damascus,
"he proceeded to Jerusalem" (Acts, chap.
ix. ver. 25). The epistle, speaking of the
same period, makes St. Paul say that "he
went into Arabia," that he returned again
to Damascus, that after three years he went
up to Jerusalem. Chap. i. ver. 17, 18.</P>
<P N="2">2. The history relates, that, when Saul
was come from Damascus, "he was with the
disciples coming in and going out" (Acts,
chap. ix. ver. 28). The epistle, describing
the same journey, tells us "that he went
up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode
with him fifteen days." Chap. i. ver. 18.</P>
<P N="3">3. The history relates, that, when Paul
was come to Jerusalem, "Barnabas took him
and brought him to the apostles" (Acts,
chap. ix. ver. 27). The epistle, "that he
saw Peter; but other of the apostles saw
he none, save James, the Lord's brother."
Chap. i. ver. 19.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="176"/>
Now this is as it should be. The histo∣rian
delivers his account in general terms, as
of facts to which he was not present. The
person who is the subject of that account,
when he comes to speak of these facts him∣self,
particularizes time, names, and circum∣stances.</P>
<P N="4">4. The like notation of places, persons,
and dates, is met with in the account of
St. Paul's journey to Jerusalem, given in the
second chapter of the epistle. It was four∣teen
years after his conversion; it was in
company with Barnabas and Titus; it was
then that he met with James, Cephas, and
John; it was then also that it was agreed
amongst them, that they should go to the
circumcision, and he unto the Gentiles.</P>
<P N="5">5. The dispute with Peter, which occupies
the sequel of the second chapter, is marked
with the same particularity. It was at An∣tioch;
it was after certain came from James;
it was whilst Barnabas was there, who was
carried away by their dissimulation. These
examples negative the insinuation, that the
epistle presents nothing but indefinite allu∣sions
to public facts.</P>

<HEAD>No. IV.</HEAD>
<P>Chap. iv. ver. 11-16. "I am afraid of
you, lest I have bestowed upon you la∣bour
in vain. Brethren, I beseech you, be
as I am, for I am as ye are. Ye have not
injured me at all. Ye know how, through
infirmity of the flesh, I preached the gos∣pel
unto you at the first; and <HI>my temptation,
which was in the flesh,</HI> ye despised not, nor
rejected; but received me as an angel of
God, even as Christ Jesus. Where is then
the blessedness you spake of? for I bear
you record, that, if it had been possible, ye
would have plucked out your own eyes,
and have given them unto me. Am I
therefore become your enemy, because I
tell you the truth?"</P>
<P>With this passage compare 2 Cor. chap.
xii. ver. 1-9: "It is not expedient for me,
doubtless, to glory; I will come to visions
and revelations of the Lord. I knew a
man in Christ above fourteen years ago
(whether in the body I cannot tell, or
whether out of the body I cannot tell;
<PB N="176" REF="178"/>
God knoweth); such a one was caught up
to the third heaven: and I knew such a
man (whether in the body or out of the
body I cannot tell, God knoweth), how
that he was caught up into Paradise,
and heard unspeakable words, which it is
not lawful for a man to utter. Of such an
one will I glory, yet of myself will I not
glory, but in mine infirmities: for, though
I would desire to glory, I shall not be a
fool; for I will say the truth. But now I
forbear, lest any man should think of me
above that which he seeth me to be, or
that he heareth of me. And lest I should
be exalted above measure, through the
abundance of the revelations, there was
given to me <HI>a thorn in the flesh, the messen∣ger
of Satan to buffet me,</HI> lest I should be
exalted above measure. For this thing
I besought the Lord thrice, that it might
depart from me. And he said unto me,
My grace is sufficient for thee; for my
strength is made perfect in weakness.
Most gladly therefore will I rather glory
in my infirmities, that the power of Christ
may rest upon me."</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="179"/>
There can be no doubt but that "the
temptation which was in the flesh," men∣tioned
in the Epistle to the Galatians, and
"the thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Sa∣tan
to buffet him," mentioned in the Epistle
to the Corinthians, were intended to denote
the same thing. Either therefore it was,
what we pretend it to have been, the same
person in both, alluding, as the occasion led
him, to some bodily infirmity under which
he laboured; that is, we are reading the real
letters of a real apostle; or, it was that a
sophist, who had seen this circumstance in
one epistle, contrived, for the sake of cor∣respondency,
to bring it into another; or,
lastly, it was a circumstance in St. Paul's
personal condition, supposed to be well
known to those into whose hands the epistle
was likely to fall; and, for that reason, in∣troduced
into a writing designed to bear his
name. I have extracted the quotations at
length, in order to enable the reader to judge
accurately of the manner in which the men∣tion
of this particular comes in, in each; be∣cause
that judgment, I think, will acquit the
authors of the epistle of the charge of
<PB N="178" REF="180"/>
having studiously inserted it, either with a
view of producing an apparent agreement
between them, or for any other purpose
whatever.</P>
<P>The context, by which the circumstance
before us in introduced, is in the two places
totally different, and without any mark of
imitation; yet in both places does the cir∣cumstance
rise aptly and naturally out of the
context, and that context from the train of
thought carried on in the epistle.</P>
<P>The Epistle to the Galatians, from the
beginning to the end, runs in a strain of
angry complaint of their defection from the
apostle, and from the principles which he
had taught them. It was very natural to
contrast, with this conduct, the zeal with
which they had once received him; and it
was not less so to mention, as a proof of their
former disposition towards him, the indul∣gence
which, whilst he was amongst them,
they had shewn to his infirmity: "My
temptation which was in the flesh ye de∣spised
not, nor rejected, but received me
as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.
Where is then the blessedness you spake
<PB N="179" REF="181"/>
of, <HI>i. e.</HI> the benedictions which you be∣stowed
upon me? for I bear you record,
that if it had been possible, ye would
have plucked out your own eyes, and
have given them to me."</P>
<P>In the two Epistles to the Corinthians,
especially in the second, we have the apostle
contending with certain teachers in Corinth,
who had formed a party in that church
against him. To vindicate his personal au∣thority,
as well as the dignity and credit of
his ministry amongst them, he takes occasion
(but not without apologizing repeatedly for
the folly, that is, for the indecorum of pro∣nouncing
his own panegyric<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>"Would to God you would bear with me a little in my folly, and indeed bear with me." Chap. xi. ver. 1.</P>
<P>"That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting." Chap. xi. ver. 17.</P>
<P>"I am become a fool in glorying, ye have compelled me." Chap. xii. ver. 11.</P></NOTE>) to meet his
adversaries in their boastings: "Wherein∣soever
any is bold (I speak foolishly) I
am bold also. Are they Hebrews? so am
I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they
<PB N="180" REF="182"/>
the seed of Abraham? so am I. Are
they the ministers of Christ? (I speak as a
fool) I am more; in labours more abun∣dant,
in stripes above measure, in prisons
more frequent, in deaths ost." Being thus
led to the subject, he goes on, as was natural,
to recount his trials and dangers, his incessant
cares and labours in the Christian mission.
From the proofs which he had given of his
zeal and activity in the service of Christ,
he passes (and that with the same view of
establishing his claim to be considered as
"not a whit behind the very chiefest of the
apostels") to the visions and revelations
which from time to time had been vouch∣safed
to him. And then, by a close and
easy connection, comes in the mention of
his insirmity: "Lest I should be exalted,"
says he, "above measure, through the abund∣ance
of revelations, there was given to me
a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan
to buffet me."</P>
<P>Thus then, in both epistles, the notice of
his infirmity is suited to the place in which
it is found. In the Epistle to the Corin∣thians,
the train of thought draws up to the
<PB N="181" REF="183"/>
circumstance by a regular approximation.
In the epistle, it is suggested by the subject
and occasion of the epistle itself. Which
observation we offer as an argument to prove
that it is not, in either epistle, a circumstance
industriously brought forward for the sake
of procuring credit to an imposture.</P>
<P>A reader will be taught to perceive the
force of this argument, who shall attempt to
introduce a <HI>given</HI> circumstance into the body
of a writing. To do this without abrupt∣ness,
or without betraying marks of design
in the transition, requires, he will find, more
art than he expected to be necessary, cer∣tainly
more than any one can believe to
have been exercised in the composition of
these epistles.</P>

<P>Chap. iv. ver. 29. "But as then he that

that was born after the spirit, even so is it
now."</P>
<P>Chap. v. ver. 11. "And I, brethren, if I yet

<P>Chap. vi. ver. 17. "From henceforth,
let no man trouble me, for I bear in my

<P>From these several texts, it is apparent
that the persecutions which our apostle had
undergone, were from the hands or by the
instigation of the Jews; that it was not
for preaching Christianity in opposition to
heathenism, but it was for preaching it as
distinct from Judaism, that he had brought
upon himself the sufferings which had at∣tended
his ministry. And this representation
perfectly coincides with that which results
from the detail of St. Paul's history, as deli∣vered
in the Acts. At Antioch, in Pisidia, the
"word of the Lord was published through∣out
all the region; but the <HI>Jews stirred
up</HI> the devout and honourable women and
the chief men of the city, and raised
persecution against Paul and Barnabas,
and expelled them out of their coasts"
(Acts, chap. xiii. ver. 50). Not long after,
at Iconium, "a great multitude of the Jews
"and also of the Greeks believed; but the
<PB N="183" REF="185"/>
<HI>unbelieving Jews</HI> stirred up the Gentiles,
and made their minds evil affected against
the brethren" (chap. xiv. ver. 1, 2). "At
Lystra there came certain Jews from An∣tioch
and Iconium, who persuaded the
people; and having stoned Paul, drew him
out of the city, supposing he had been
dead" (chap. xiv. ver. 19). The same
enmity, and from the same quarter, our apo∣stle
experienced in Greece: "At Thessalo∣nica,
some of them (the Jews) believed,
and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of
the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of
the chief women not a few: but <HI>the Jews
which believed not,</HI> moved with envy, took
unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser
sort, and gathered a company, and set all
the city in an uproar, and assaulted the
house of Jason, and sought to bring them
out to the people" (Acts, chap. xvii.
ver. 4, 5). Their persecutors follow them to
Beraea: "When the <HI>Jews</HI> of Thessalonica
had knowledge that the word of God was
preached of St. Paul at Beraea, they came
thither also, and stirred up the people"
(chap. xvii. ver. 13). And lastly at Corinth,
<PB N="184" REF="186"/>
when Gallio was deputy of Achaia, "<HI>the
Jews</HI> made insurrection with one accord
against Paul, and brought him to the
judgment-seat." I think it does not ap∣pear
that our apostle was ever set upon by
the Gentiles, unless they were first stirred
up by the Jews, except in two instances; in
both which the persons who began the as∣sault
were immediately interested in his ex∣pulsion
from the place. Once this happened
at Philippi, after the cure of the Pythoness:
"When the masters saw the hope of their
gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas,
and drew them into the market-place unto
the rulers" (chap. xvi. ver. 19). And a
second time at Ephesus, at the instance of
Demetrius a silversmith which made silver
shrines for Diana, "who called together work∣men
of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye
know that by this craft we have our wealth;
moreover, ye see and hear that not only at
Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia,
this Paul hath persuaded away much peo∣ple,
saying, that they be no gods which are
made with hands; so that not only this
our craft is in danger to be set at nought,
<PB N="185" REF="187"/>
but also that the temple of the great god∣dess
Diana should be despised, and her
magnificence should be destroyed, whom
all Asia and the world worshippeth."</P>

<P>I observe an agreement in a somewhat
peculiar rule of Christian conduct, as laid
down in this epistle, and as exemplified in
the second Epistle to the Corinthians. It is
not the repetition of the same general pre∣cept,
which would have been a coincidence
of little value; but it is the general pre∣cept
in one place, and the application of
that precept to an actual occurrence in the
other. In the sixth chapter and first verse
of this epistle, our apostle gives the follow∣ing
direction: "Brethren, if a man be over∣taken
in a fault, ye, which are spiritual,
restore such a one in the spirit of meek∣ness."
In 2 Cor. chap. ii. ver. 6-8, he
writes thus: "Sufficient to such a man" (the
incestuous person mentioned in the first
epistle) "is this punishment, which was in∣flicted
of many; so that, contrariwise, ye
<PB N="186" REF="188"/>
ought rather to forgive him and comfort
him, lest perhaps such a one should be
swallowed up with over-much sorrow;
wherefore I beseech you that ye would
confirm your love towards him." I have
little doubt but that it was the same mind
which dictated these two passages.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="7" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>No. VII.</HEAD>
<P>Our epistle goes farther than any of St.
Paul's epistles; for it avows in direct terms
the supersession of the Jewish law, as an
instrument of salvation, even to the Jews
themselves. Not only were the Gentiles
exempt from its authority, but even the
Jews were no longer either to place any
dependency upon it, or consider themselves
as subject to it on a religious account. "Be∣fore
faith came, we were kept under the
law, shut up unto the faith which should
afterwards be revealed; wherefore the law
was our schoolmaster to bring us unto
Christ, that we might be justified by faith;
but, after that faith is come, <HI>we are no longer
under a schoolmaster</HI>" (ch. iii. ver. 23-25).</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="189"/>
This was undoubtedly spoken of Jews
and to Jews. In like manner, chap. iv.
ver. 1-5: "Now I say that the heir, as
long as he is a child, differeth nothing
from a servant, though he be lord of all;
but is under tutors and governors until the
time appointed of the father: even so we,
when we were children, were in bondage
under the elements of the world; but, when
the fulness of time was come, God sent
forth his Son, made of a woman, made
under the law, to <HI>redeem them that were
under the law,</HI> that we might receive the
adoption of sons." These passages are no∣thing
short of a declaration, that the obliga∣tion
of the Jewish law, considered as a reli∣gious
dispensation, the effects of which were
to take place in another life, had ceased,
with respect even to the Jews themselves.
What then should be the conduct of a Jew
(for such St. Paul was) who preached this
doctrine? To be consistent with himself,
either he would no longer comply, in his
own person, with the directions of the law;
or, if he did comply, it would be for some
other reason than any considence which he
<PB N="188" REF="190"/>
placed in its efficacy, as a religious institution.
Now so it happens, that whenever St. Paul's
compliance with the Jewish law is mentioned
in the history, it is mentioned in connection
with circumstances which point out the motive
from which it proceeded; and this motive
appears to have been always exoteric, namely,
a love of order and tranquillity, or an un∣willingness
to give unnecessary offence. Thus,
Acts, chap. xvi. ver. 3: "Him (Timothy)
would Paul have to go forth with him,
and took and circumcised him, <HI>because of
the Jews which were in those quarters.</HI>"
Again (Acts, chap. xxi. ver. 26), when Paul
consented to exhibit an example of public
compliance with a Jewish rite, by purifying
himself in the temple, it is plainly intimat∣ed
that he did this to satisfy "many thou∣sand
of Jews who believed, and who were
all zealous of the law." So far the in∣stances
related in one book, correspond with
the doctrine delivered in another.</P>

<P>Chap. i. ver. 18. "Then, after three
years, I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter,
and abode with him fifteen days."</P>
<P>The shortness of St. Paul's stay at Jerusa∣lem,
is what I desire the reader to remark.
The direct account of the same journey in
the Acts, chap. ix. ver. 28, determines no∣thing
concerning the time of his continu∣ance
there: "And he was with them (the
apostles) coming in, and going out, at Je∣rusalem;
and he spake boldly in the name
of the Lord Jesus, and disputed against
the Grecians, but they went about to slay
him; which when the brethren knew,
they brought him down to Caesarea." Or
rather this account, taken by itself, would
lead a reader to suppose that St. Paul's abode
at Jerusalem had been longer than fifteen
days. But turn to the twenty-second chap∣ter
of the Acts, and you will find a reference
to this visit to Jerusalem, which plainly in∣dicates
that Paul's continuance in that city
had been of short duration: "And it came
<PB N="190" REF="192"/>
to pass, that when I was come again
to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the
temple, I was in a trance, and saw him
saying unto me, Make haste, get thee
quickly out of Jerusalem, for they will
not receive thy testimony concerning me."
Here we have the general terms of one text
so explained by a distant text in the same
book, as to bring an indeterminate expression
into close conformity with a specification de∣livered
in another book: a species of con∣sistency
not, I think, usually found in fabu∣lous
relations.</P>

<P>Chap. vi. ver. 11. "Ye see how large a
letter I have written unto you with mine
own hand."</P>
<P>These words imply that he did not always
write with his own hand; which is consonant
to what we find intimated in some other of
the epistles. The Epistle to the Romans
was written by Tertius: "I Tertius, who
wrote this epistle, salute you in the Lord"
(chap. xvi. ver. 22). The first Epistle to
<PB N="191" REF="193"/>
the Corinthians, the Epistle to the Colos∣sians,
and the second to the Thessalonians,
have all, near the conclusion, this clause.
"The salutation of me, Paul, with mine own
hand;" which must be understood, and
is universally understood to import, that the
rest of the epistle was written by another
hand. I do not think it improbable that an
impostor, who had remarked this subscrip∣tion
in some other epistle, should invent the
same in a forgery; but that is not done
here. The author of this epistle does not
imitate the manner of giving St. Paul's sig∣nature;
he only bids the Galatians observe
how large a letter he had written to them
with his own hand. He does not say this
was different from his ordinary usage;
that is left to implication. Now to sup∣pose
that this was an artifice to procure cre∣dit
to an imposture, is to suppose that the
author of the forgery, because he knew that
others of St. Paul's were <HI>not</HI> written by him∣self,
therefore made the apostle say that this
was: which seems an odd turn to give to
the circumstance, and to be given for a pur∣pose,
which would more naturally and more
<PB N="192" REF="194"/>
directly have been answered, by subjoining
the salutation or signature in the form in
which it is found in other epistles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The words <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> may probably be meant to describe the character in which he wrote, and not the length of the letter. But this will not alter the truth of our observation. I think however, that as St. Paul by the mention of his own hand designed to express to the Galatians the great concern which he felt for them, the words, whatever they signify, belong to the whole of the epistle; and not, as Grotius, after St. Jerom, interprets it, to the few verses which follow.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>An exact conformity appears in the man∣ner
in which a certain apostle or eminent
Christian, whose name was James, is spo∣ken
of in the epistle and in the history.
Both writings refer to a situation of his at
Jerusalem, somewhat different from that of
the other apostles; a kind of eminence or
presidency in the church there, or at least a
more fixed and stationary residence. Chap.
ii. ver. 12, "When Peter was at Antioch,
before that certain came from James, he
did eat with the Gentiles." This text
<PB N="193" REF="195"/>
plainly attributes a kind of pre-eminency to
James; and, as we hear of him twice in the
same epistle dwelling at Jerusalem, chap. i.
ver. 19, and ii. 9, we must apply it to the
situation which he held in that church. In
the Acts of the Apostles divers intimations
occur, conveying the same idea of James's
situation. When Peter was miraculously
delivered from prison, and had surprised his
friends by his appearance among them,
after declaring unto them how the Lord
had brought him out of prison, "Go shew,"
says he, "these things unto James, and to
"the brethren" (Acts, chap. xii. ver. 17).
Here James is manifestly spoken of in terms
of distinction. He appears again with like
distinction in the twenty-first chapter and
the seventeenth and eighteenth verses: "And
when we" (Paul and his company) "were
come to Jerusalem; the day following, Paul
went in with us unto James, and all the
elders were present." In the debate which
took place upon the business of the Gentile
converts, in the council at Jerusalem, this
same person seems to have taken the lead.
It was he who closed the debate, and pro∣posed
<PB N="194" REF="196"/>
the resolution in which the council
ultimately concurred: "Wherefore my sen∣tence
is, that we trouble not them which
from among the Gentiles are turned to
God."</P>
<P>Upon the whole, that there exists a con∣formity
in the expressions used concerning
<HI>James,</HI> throughout the history, and in the
epistle, is unquestionable. But admitting
this conformity, and admitting also the un∣designedness
of it, what does it prove? It
proves that the circumstance itself is founded
in truth; that is, that James was a real
person, who held a situation of eminence in
a real society of Christians at Jerusalem. It
confirms also those parts of the narrative
which are connected with this circumstance.
Suppose, for instance, the truth of the ac∣count
of Peter's escape from prison was to
be tried upon the testimony of a witness
who, amongst other things, made Peter, after
his deliverance, say, "Go shew these things
to James and to the brethren;" would it
not be material, in such a trial, to make out
by other independent proofs, or by a com∣parison
of proofs drawn from independent
<PB N="195" REF="197"/>
sources, that there was actually at that time,
living at Jerusalem, such a person as James;
that this person held such a situation in the
society amongst whom these things were
transacted, as to render the words which
Peter is said to have used concerning him,
proper and natural for him to have used? If
this would be pertinent in the discussion of
oral testimony, it is still more so in appre∣ciating
the credit of remote history.</P>
<P>It must not be dissembled that the com∣parison
of our epistle with the history pre∣sents
some difficulties, or, to say the least,
some questions, of considerable magnitude.
It may be doubted, in the first place, to what
journey the words which open the second
chapter of the epistle, "then, fourteen years
afterwards, I went unto Jerusalem," relate.
That which best corresponds with the date,
and that to which most interpreters apply
the passage, is the journey of Paul and Bar∣nabas
to Jerusalem, when they went thither
from Antioch, upon the business of the Gen∣tile
converts; and which journey produced
the famous council and decree recorded in
the fifteenth chapter of Acts. To me this
<PB N="196" REF="198"/>
opinion appears to be encumbered with
strong objections. In the epistle Paul tells
us that "he went up by revelation" (chap.
ii. ver. 2). In the Acts, we read that he
was sent by the church of Antioch: "After
no small dissension and disputation, they
determined that Paul and Barnabas, and
certain other of them, should go up to the
apostles and elders about this question"
(Acts, chap. xv. ver. 2). This is not very
reconcileable. In the epistle St. Paul writes
that, when he came to Jerusalem, "he com∣municated
that Gospel which he preached
among the Gentiles, but privately to them
which were of reputation" (chap. ii. ver.
2). If by "that Gospel" be meant the im∣munity
of the Gentile Christians from the
Jewish law (and I know not what else it
can mean), it is not easy to conceive how he
should communicate that privately, which
was the subject of his public message. But
a yet greater difficulty remains, viz. that in
the account which the epistle gives of what
passed upon this visit at Jerusalem, no notice
is taken of the deliberation and decree which
are recorded in the Acts, and which, ac∣cording
<PB N="197" REF="199"/>
to that history, formed the business
for the sake of which the journey was un∣dertaken.
The mention of the council and
of its determination, whilst the apostle was
relating his proceedings at Jerusalem, could
hardly have been avoided, if in truth the
narrative belong to the same journey. To
me it appears more probable that Paul and
Barnabas had taken some journey to Jerusa∣lem,
the mention of which is omitted in the
Acts. Prior to the apostolic decree, we read
that "Paul and Barnabas abode at Antioch
a long time with the disciples" (Acts,
chap. xiv. ver. 28). Is it is unlikely that, du∣ring
this long abode, they might go up to Je∣rusalem
and return to Antioch? Or would
the omission of such a journey be unsuitable
to the general brevity with which these
memoirs are written, especially of those
parts of St. Paul's history which took place
before the historian joined his society?</P>
<P>But, again, the first account we find in
the Acts of the Apostles of St. Paul's visiting
Galatia, is in the sixteenth chapter, and the
sixth verse: "Now when they had gone
through Phrygia and the region of Ga∣latia,
<PB N="198" REF="200"/>
they assayed to go into Bithynia."
The progress here recorded was subsequent
to the apostolic decree; therefore that de∣cree
must have been extant when our epistle
was written. Now, as the professed design
of the epistle was to establish the exemp∣tion
of the Gentile converts from the law
of Moses, and as the decree pronounced
and confirmed that exemption, it may seem
extraordinary that no notice whatever is
taken of that determination, nor any appeal
made to its authority. Much however of
the weight of this objection, which applies
also to some other of St. Paul's epistles, is
removed by the following reflections.</P>
<P N="1">1. It was not St. Paul's manner, nor agree∣able
to it, to resort or defer much to the au∣thority
of the other apostles, especially whilst
he was insisting, as he does strenuously
throughout this epistle insist, upon his own
original inspiration. He who could speak
of the very chiefest of the apostles in such
terms as the following—"of those who
seemed to be somewhat (whatsoever they
were it maketh no matter to me, God
accepteth no man's person) for they who
<PB N="199" REF="201"/>
seemed to be somewhat in conference
added nothing to me"—he, I say, was not
likely to support himself by their decision.</P>
<P N="2">2. The epistle argues the point upon
principle; and it is not perhaps more to be
wondered at, that in such an argument St.
Paul should not cite the apostolic decree,
than it would be that, in a discourse designed
to prove the moral and religious duty of
observing the sabbath, the writer should not
quote the thirteenth canon.</P>
<P N="3">3. The decree did not go the length of
the position maintained in the epistle; the
decree only declares that the apostles and
elders at Jerusalem did not impose the ob∣servance
of the Mosaic law upon the Gen∣tile
converts, as a condition of their being
admitted into the Christian church. Our
epistle argues that the Mosaic institution
itself was at an end, as to all effects upon
a future state, even with respect to the Jews
themselves.</P>
<P N="4">4. They whose error St. Paul combat∣ted,
were not persons who submitted to
the Jewish law, because it was imposed by
the authority, or because it was made part
<PB N="200" REF="202"/>
of the law of the Christian church; but they
were persons who, having already become
Christians, afterwards voluntarily took upon
themselves the observance of the Mosaic
code, under a notion of attaining thereby to
a greater perfection. This, I think, is pre∣cisely
the opinion which St. Paul opposes
in this epistle. Many of his expressions
apply exactly to it: "Are ye so foolish?
having begun in the spirit, are ye now
made perfect in the flesh?" (chap. iii.
ver. 3). "Tell me, ye that desire to be
under the law, do ye not hear the law?"
(chap. iv. ver. 21.) "How turn ye again
to the weak and beggarly elements, where-unto
ye desire again to be in bondage?"
(chap. iv. ver. 9). It cannot be thought
extraordinary that St. Paul should resist this
opinion with earnestness; for it both changed
the character of the Christian dispensation,
and derogated expressly from the complete∣ness
of that redemption which Jesus Christ
had wrought for them that believed in him.
But it was to no purpose to alledge to such
persons the decision at Jerusalem, for that
only shewed that they were not bound to
<PB N="201" REF="203"/>
these observances by any law of the Christian
church: they did not pretend to be so bound.
Nevertheless they imagined that there was an
efficacy in these observances, a merit, a re∣commendation
to favour, and a ground of
acceptance with God for those who com∣plied
with them. This was a situation of
thought to which the tenor of the decree
did not apply. Accordingly, St. Paul's ad∣dress
to the Galatians, which is throughout
adapted to this situation, runs in a strain
widely different from the language of the
decree: "Christ is become of no effect unto
you, whosoever of you are justified by the
law" (chap. v. ver. 4); <HI>i. e.</HI> whosoever
places his dependance upon any merit he
may apprehend there to be in legal obser∣vances.
The decree had said nothing like
this; therefore it would have been useless
to have produced the decree in an argument
of which this was the burthen. In like
manner as in contending with an anchorite,
who should insist upon the superior holiness
of a recluse, ascetic life, and the value of
such mortifications in the sight of God, it
would be to no purpose to prove that the
<PB N="202" REF="204"/>
laws of the church did not require these
vows, or even to prove that the laws of the
church expressly left every Christian to his
liberty. This would avail little towards
abating his estimation of their merit, or to∣wards
settling the point in controversy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr. Locke's solution of this difficulty is by no means satisfactory. "St. Paul," he says, "did not remind the Galatians of the apostolic decree, because they already had it." In the first place, it does not appear with certainty that they had it; in the second place, if they had it, this was rather a reason, than other∣wise, for referring them to it. The passage in the Acts, from which Mr. Locke concludes that the Galatic churches were in possession of the decree, is the fourth verse of the sixteenth chapter: "And as they" (Paul and Timothy) "went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem." In my opinion, this delivery of the decree was confined to the churches to which St. Paul came, in pursuance of the plan upon which he set out, of "visiting the brethren in every city where he had preached the word of the Lord;" the history of which progress, and of all that pertained to it, is closed in the fifth verse, when the his∣tory informs us that "so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily." Then the history proceeds upon a new section of the narrative, by telling us that "when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, they assayed to go into Bithynia." The decree itself is directed "to the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia;" that is, to churches already found∣ed, and in which this question had been stirred. And I think the observation of the noble author of the Miscel∣lanea Sacra is not only ingenious, but highly probable, viz. that there is, in this place, a dislocation of the text, and that the fourth and fifth verses of the sixteenth chapter ought to follow the last verse of the fifteenth, so as to make the entire passage run thus: "And they went through Syria and Cilicia" (to the Christians of which countries the decree was addressed), "confirming the churches; and as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jeru∣salem; and so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily." And then the sixteenth chapter takes up a new and unbroken para∣graph: "Then came he to Derbe and Lystra, &amp;c." When St. Paul came, as he did into Galatia, to preach the gospel, for the first time, in a new place, it is not probable that he would make mention of the decree, or rather letter, of the church of Jerusalem, which pre∣supposed Christianity to be known, and which related to certain doubts that had arisen in some established Chris∣tian communities.</P>
<P>The second reason which Mr. Locke assigns for the omission of the decree, viz. "that St. Paul's sole object in the epistle, was to acquit himself of the imputátion that had been charged upon him of actually preaching circumcision," does not appear to me to be strictly true. It was not the sole object. The epistle is written in general opposition to the Judaizing inclinations which he found to prevail amongst his converts. The avowal of his own doctrine, and of his steadfast adherence to that doctrine, formed a necessary part of the design of his letter, but was not the whole of it.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="205"/>
Another difficulty arises from the account
of Peter's conduct towards the Gentile con∣verts
at Antioch, as given in the epistle, in
the latter part of the second chapter; which
conduct, it is said, is consistent neither with
the revelation communicated to him, upon
<PB N="204" REF="206"/>
the conversion of Cornelius, nor with the
part he took in the debate at Jerusalem.
But, in order to understand either the diffi∣culty
or the solution, it will be necessary to
state and explain the passage itself. "When
Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood
him to the face, because he was to be
blamed; for, before that certain came
from James, he did eat with the Gentiles;
but when they were come, he withdrew
and separated himself, fearing them which
were of the circumcision; and the other
Jews dissembled likewise with him, in∣somuch
that Barnabas also was carried
away with their dissimulation: but when
<PB N="205" REF="207"/>
I saw they walked not uprightly, according
to the truth of the Gospel, I said unto
Peter, before them all, If thou, being a
Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles,
and not as do the Jews, why compellest
thou the Gentiles to live as do the
Jews?" Now the question that produced
the dispute to which these words relate, was
not whether the Gentiles were capable of
being admitted into the Christian covenant;
that had been fully settled: nor was it
whether it should be accounted essential to
the profession of Christianity that they should
conform themselves to the law of Moses;
that was the question at Jerusalem: but it
was, whether, upon the Gentiles becoming
Christians, the Jews might thenceforth eat
and drink with them, as with their own bre∣thren.
Upon this point St. Peter betrayed
some inconstancy; and so he might, agree∣ably
enough to his history. He might con∣sider
the vision at Joppa as a direction for
the occasion, rather than as universally abo∣lishing
the distinction between Jew and
Gentile; I do not mean with respect to final
<PB N="206" REF="208"/>
acceptance with God, but as to the manner
of their living together in society: at least
he might not have comprehended this point
with such clearness and certainty, as to stand
out upon it against the fear of bringing upon
himself the censure and complaint of his
brethren in the church of Jerusalem, who
still adhered to their ancient prejudices. But
Peter, it is said, compelled the Gentiles
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>—"why compellest thou the Gen∣tiles
to live as do the Jews?" How did he do
that? The only way in which Peter appears
to have compelled the Gentiles to comply
with the Jewish institution, was by with∣drawing
himself from their society. By
which he may be understood to have made
this declaration: "We do not deny your
right to be considered as Christians; we
do not deny your title in the promises of
the Gospel, even without compliance with
our law; but if you would have us Jews
live with you, as we do with one another,
that is, if you would in all respects be
treated by us as Jews, you must live as such
yourselves." This, I think, was the com∣pulsion
<PB N="207" REF="209"/>
which St. Peter's conduct imposed
upon the Gentiles, and for which St. Paul
reproved him.</P>
<P>As to the part which the historian ascribes
to St. Peter, in the debate at Jerusalem, be∣side
that it was a different question which
was there agitated from that which pro∣duced
the dispute at Antioch, there is no∣thing
to hinder us from supposing that the
dispute at Antioch was prior to the consulta∣tion
at Jerusalem; or that Peter, in conse∣quence
of this rebuke, might have afterwards
maintained firmer sentiments.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD>THE EPISTLE TO THE EPHESIANS.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>No. I.</HEAD>
<P>THIS epistle, and the epistle to the
Colossians, appear to have been trans∣mitted
to their respective churches by the
same messenger: "But that ye also may
know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus,
a beloved brother and faithful minister in
the Lord, shall make known to you all
things; whom I have sent unto you for
the same purpose, that ye might know
our affairs, and that he might comfort
your hearts" (Eph. chap. vi. ver. 21, 22).
This text, if it do not expressly declare,
clearly I think intimates, that the letter
was sent by Tychicus. The words made
use of in the epistle to the Colossians are
very similar to these, and afford the same
implication that Tychicus, in conjunction
with Onesimus, was the bearer of the letter
<PB N="209" REF="211"/>
to that church: "All my state shall Tychicus
declare unto you, who is a beloved bro∣ther,
and a faithful minister, and fellow
servant in the Lord, whom I have sent
unto you for the same purpose, that he
might know your estate, and comfort your
hearts; with Onesimus, a faithful and be∣loved
brother, who is one of you: they
shall make known unto you all things
which are done here" (Colos. chap. iv.
ver. 7-9). Both epistles represent the writer
as under imprisonment for the gospel; and
both treat of the same general subject. The
epistle therefore to the Ephesians, and the
epistle to the Colossians, import to be two
letters written by the same person, at, or
nearly at, the same time, and upon the same
subject, and to have been sent by the same
messenger. Now, every thing in the senti∣ments,
order, and diction of the two writings
corresponds with what might be expected
from this circumstance of identity or cogna∣tion
in their original. The leading doctrine
of both epistles is the union of Jews and
Gentiles under the Christian dispensation;
and that doctrine in both is established by
<PB N="210" REF="212"/>
the same arguments, or, more properly speak∣ing,
illustrated by the same similitudes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">St. Paul, I am apt to believe, has been sometimes accused of inconclusive reasoning, by our mistaking that for reasoning which was only intended for illustration. He is not to be read as a man, whose own persuasion of the truth of what he taught always or solely depended upon the views under which he represents it in his writings. Taking for granted the certainty of his doc∣trine, as resting upon the revelation that had been im∣parted to him, he exhibits it frequently to the conception of his readers under images and allegories, in which if an analogy may be perceived, or even sometimes a poetic resemblance be found, it is all perhaps that is required.</NOTE>:
"one head," "one body," "one new

and, as had been thought, the indelible
distinction between Jew and Gentile, in both
epistles, is declared to be "now abolished by
his cross." Beside this consent in the ge∣neral
<PB N="211" REF="213"/>
tenor of the two epistles, and in the
run also and warmth of thought with which
they are composed, we may naturally expect,
in letters produced under the circumstances,
in which these appear to have been written,
a closer resemblance of style and diction,
than between other letters of the same per∣son,
but of distant dates, or between letters
adapted to different occasions. In particular
we may look for many of the same ex∣pressions,
and sometimes for whole sentences
being alike; since such expressions and sen∣tences
would be repeated in the second let∣ter
(whichever that was) as yet fresh in the
author's mind from the writing of the first.
This repetition occurs in the following ex∣amples<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When <HI>verbal</HI> comparisons are relied upon, it be∣comes necessary to state the original; but that the English reader may be interrupted as little as may be, I shall in general do this in the note.</NOTE>:</P>
<P>Ephes. ch. i. ver. 7. "In whom we have

of sins<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ephes. ch. i. ver. 7. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE>."</P>

<P>Beside the sameness of the words, it is
farther remarkable that the sentence is, in
both places, preceded by the same intro∣ductory
idea. In the Epistle to the Ephe∣sians
it is the "<HI>beloved</HI>" (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>); in
that to the Colossians it is "<HI>his dear Son</HI>"
(<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>), "in whom we have
redemption." The sentence appears to
have been suggested to the mind of the
writer by the idea, which had accompanied
it before.</P>
<P>Ephes. ch. i. ver. 10. "All things both
which are in heaven and which are in
earth, even in him<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ephes. ch. i. ver. 10. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE>."</P>

<P><PB N="213" REF="215"/>
This quotation is the more observable,
because the connecting of things in earth
with things in heaven is a very singular
sentiment, and found no where else but in
these two epistles. The words also are in∣troduced
and followed by a train of thought
nearly alike. They are introduced by de∣scribing
the union, which Christ had effected,
and they are followed by telling the Gen∣tile
churches that they were incorporated
into it.</P>
<P>Ephes. ch. iii. ver. 2. "The dispensation

<P>Of these sentences it may likewise be
observed, that the accompanying ideas are
similar. In both places they are imme∣diately
preceded by the mention of his pre∣sent
sufferings; in both places they are im∣mediately
followed by the mention of the
<PB N="214" REF="216"/>
mystery which was the great subject of his
preaching.</P>
<P>Ephes. ch. v. ver. 19. "In psalms and

your hearts<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Colos. ch. iv. ver. 8. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE>."</P>
<P>In these examples, we do not perceive a
cento of phrases gathered from one compo∣sition,
<PB N="215" REF="217"/>
and strung together in the other;
but the occasional occurrence of the same
expression to a mind a second time revolving
the same ideas.</P>
<P>2. Whoever writes two letters, or two
discourses, nearly upon the same subject,
and at no great distance of time, but with∣out
any express recollection of what he had
written before, will find himself repeating
some sentences, in the very order of the
words, in which he had already used them;
but he will more frequently find himself
employing some principal terms, with the
order inadvertently changed, or with the
order disturbed by the intermixture of other
words and phrases expressive of ideas rising
up at the time; or in many instances re∣peating
not single words, nor yet whole
sentences, but parts and fragments of sen∣tences.
Of all these varieties the examina∣tion
of our two epistles will furnish plain
examples: and I should rely upon this class
of instances more than upon the last; be∣cause,
although an impostor might tran∣scribe
into a forgery entire sentences and
phrases, yet the dislocation of words, the
<PB N="216" REF="218"/>
partial recollection of phrases and sentences,
the intermixture of new terms and new
ideas with terms and ideas before used,
which will appear in the examples that fol∣low,
and which are the natural properties
of writings produced under the circumstances
in which these epistles are represented to
have been composed would not, I think,
have occurred to the invention of a forger;
nor, if they had occurred, would they have
been so easily executed. This studied va∣riation
was a resinement in forgery which
I believe did not exist; or, if we can sup∣pose
it to have been practised in the instances
adduced below, why, it may be asked, was
not the same art exercised upon those which
we have collected in the preceding class?</P>

<P>Out of the long quotation from the Ephe∣sians,
take away the parentheses, and you
have left a sentence almost in terms the

the original than in our translation; for

<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Here therefore
we have the same sentiment, and nearly
in the same words; but, in the Ephesians,
twice broken or interrupted by incidental
thoughts, which St. Paul, as his manner
was, enlarges upon by the way<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vide Locke, in loc.</NOTE>, and then
returns to the thread of his discourse. It
is interrupted the first time by a view which
<PB N="219" REF="221"/>
breaks in upon his mind of the exaltation
of Christ; and the second time by a de∣scription
of heathen depravity. I have only
to remark that Griesbach, in his very ac∣curate

nearly in the same manner, in which they
are here placed; and that without any re∣spect
to the comparison, which we are pro∣posing.</P>

the same model; in the one, he is "after
God created in righteousness and true

when the mind, exercised upon the same

subject, is left to the spontaneous return of
such terms and phrases, as, having been used
before, may happen to present themselves
again. The sentiment of both passages is
throughout alike: half of that sentiment, the
denunciation of God's wrath, is expressed in
identical words; the other half, viz. the
admonition to quit their former conversa∣tion,

<P>This is another example of that mixture
which we remarked of sameness and variety
in the language of one writer. "Redeeming
the time" (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) is a li∣teral
repetition. "Walk not as fools, but as

answers exactly in sense, and nearly in

terms, to "walk in wisdom"
(<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>). <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is a very dif∣ferent
phrase, but is intended to convey
precisely the same idea as <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
is not well rendered
"circumspectly." It means what in mo∣dern
speech we should call "correctly;"
and when we advise a person to behave
"correctly," our advice is always given
with a reference to "the opinion of others,"
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. "Walk correctly, redeeming

difficulty and ticklishness of the times in

<P>In these quotations, the phrase "as I ought

church, and he is the saviour of the body.
Therefore, as the church is subject unto
<PB N="228" REF="230"/>
Christ, so let the wives be to their own
husbands in every thing. <HI>Husbands, love
your wives,</HI> even as Christ also loved the
church, and gave himself for it, that he
might sanctify and cleanse it with the
washing of water by the word; that he
might present it to himself a glorious
church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any
such thing; but that it should be holy and
without blemish. So ought men to love
their wives as their own bodies. He that
loveth his wife, loveth himself; for no
man ever yet hated his own flesh, but nou∣risheth
and cherisheth it, even as the Lord
the church; for we are members of his
body, of his flesh, and of his bones. For
this cause shall a man leave his father and
his mother, and be joined unto his wife,
and they two shall be one flesh. This is
a great mystery; but I speak concerning
Christ and the church. Nevertheless, let
every one of you, in particular, so love
his wife even as himself; and the wife see
that she reverence her husband. <HI>Children,

<P>The passages marked by Italics in the quo∣tation
from the Ephesians, bear a strict resem∣blance,
not only in signification but in terms,
to the quotation from the Colossians. Both the
words and the order of the words are in many
clauses a duplicate of one another. In the
epistle to the Colossians, these passages are
laid together; in that to the Ephesians, they
are divided by intermediate matter, especi∣ally
by a long digressive allusion to the mys∣terious
union between Christ and his church;
which possessing, as Mr. Locke hath well
observed, the mind of the apostle, from
being an incidental thought, grows up into
the principal subject. The affinity between
these two passages in signification, in terms,
<PB N="232" REF="234"/>
and in the order of the words, is closer than
can be pointed out between any parts of
any two epistles in the volume.</P>
<P>If the reader would see how the same
subject is treated by a different hand, and
how distinguishable it is from the produc∣tion
of the same pen, let him turn to the
second and third chapters of the first epistle
of St. Peter. The duties of servants, of
wives and of husbands, are enlarged upon in
that epistle, as they are in the Epistle to the
Ephesians; but the subjects both occur in a
different order, and the train of sentiment
subjoined to each is totally unlike.</P>
<P>3. In two letters issuing from the same
person, nearly at the same time, and upon
the same general occasion, we may expect
to trace the influence of association in the
order in which the topics follow one ano∣ther.
Certain ideas universally or usually
suggest others. Here the order is what we
call natural, and from such an order nothing
can be concluded. But when the order is
arbitrary, yet alike, the concurrence indi∣cates
the effect of that principle, by which
ideas, which have been once joined, com∣monly
<PB N="233" REF="235"/>
revisit the thoughts together. The
epistles under consideration furnish the two
following remarkable instances of this species
of agreement.</P>
<P>Ephes. ch. iv. ver. 24. "And that ye put
on the new man, which after God is
created in righteousness and true holiness;
wherefore, putting away lying, speak every
man truth with his neighbour, for we are
members one of another<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ephes. ch. iv. ver. 24, 25. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE>."</P>
<P>Colos. ch. iii. ver. 9. "Lie not one to
another; seeing that ye have put off the
old man, with his deeds; and have put
on the new man, which is renewed in
knowledge<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Colos. ch. iii. ver. 9. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE>."</P>
<P>The vice of "lying," or a correction of
that vice, does not seem to bear any nearer
relation to the "putting on the new man,"
than a reformation in any other article of
<PB N="234" REF="236"/>
morals. Yet these two ideas, we see, stand
in both epistles in immediate connection.</P>
<P>Ephes. ch. v. ver. 20, 21. "Giving thanks
always for all things unto God and the
Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ; submitting yourselves one to ano∣ther,
in the fear of God. Wives, sub∣mit
yourselves unto your own husbands,
as unto the Lord<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ephes. ch. v. ver. 20-22. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE>."</P>
<P>Colos. ch. iii. ver. 17. "Whatsoever ye
do, in word or deed, do all in the name
of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God
and the Father by him. Wives, submit
yourselves unto your own husbands, as it
is sit in the Lord<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Colos. ch. iii. ver. 17. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE>."</P>
<P>In both these passages, submission follows
giving of thanks, without any similitude in
the ideas which should account for the
transition.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="237"/>
It is not necessary to pursue the compari∣son
between the two epistles farther. The
argument which results from it stands thus:
Now two other epistles contain a circumstance
which indicates that they were written at
the same, or nearly at the same time. No
two other epistles exhibit so many marks of
correspondency and resemblance. If the
original which we ascribe to these two epi∣stles
be the true one, that is, if they were
both really written by St. Paul, and both
sent to their respective destination by the
same messenger, the similitude is, in all
points, what should be expected to take
place. If they were forgeries, then the
mention of Tychicus in both epistles, and
in a manner which shews that he either
carried or accompanied both epistles, was
inserted for the purpose of accounting for
their similitude; or else the structure of the
epistles was designedly adapted to that cir∣cumstance;
or, lastly, the conformity be∣tween
the contents of the forgeries, and
what is thus indirectly intimated concerning
their date, was only a happy accident. Not
one of these three suppositions will gain
<PB N="236" REF="238"/>
credit with a reader who peruses the epistles
with attention, and who reviews the several
examples we have pointed out, and the ob∣servations
with which they were accom∣panied.</P>

<P>There is such a thing as a peculiar word
or phrase cleaving, as it were, to the me∣mory
of a writer or speaker, and presenting
itself to his utterance at every turn. When
we observe this, we call it a <HI>cant</HI> word, or
a <HI>cant</HI> phrase. It is a natural effect of habit;
and would appear more frequently than it
does, had not the rules of good writing
taught the ear to be offended with the itera∣tion
of the same sound, and oftentimes caused
us to reject, on that account, the word which
offered itself first to our recollection. With
a writer who, like St. Paul, either knew not
these rules, or disregarded them, such words
will not be avoided. The truth is, an ex∣ample
of this kind runs through several
of his epistles, and in the epistle before us
<HI>abounds</HI>; and that is in the word <HI>riches</HI>
(<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>), used metaphorically as an aug∣mentative
<PB N="237" REF="239"/>
of the idea to which it happens
to be subjoined. Thus, "the <HI>riches</HI> of his
glory," "his <HI>riches</HI> in glory," "<HI>riches</HI> of the
glory of his inheritance," "<HI>riches</HI> of the
glory of this mystery," Rom. ch. ix. ver. 23,
Ephes. ch. iii. ver. 16, Ephes. ch. i. ver. 18,
Colos. ch. i. ver. 27; "<HI>riches</HI> of his grace,"
twice in the Ephesians, ch. i. ver. 7, and ch.
ii. ver. 7; "<HI>riches</HI> of the full assurance of
understanding," Colos. ch. ii. ver. 2; "<HI>riches</HI>
of his goodness," Rom. ch. ii. ver. 4; "<HI>riches</HI>
of the wisdom of God," Rom. ch. xi.
ver. 33; "<HI>riches</HI> of Christ," Ephes. ch. iii.
ver. 8. In a like sense the adjective, Rom.
ch. x. ver. 12, "<HI>rich</HI> unto all that call upon
him;" Ephes. ch. ii. ver. 4, "<HI>rich</HI> in mer∣cy;"
1 Tim. ch. vi. ver. 18, "<HI>rich</HI> in good
works." Also the adverb, Colos. ch. iii.
ver. 16, "let the word of Christ dwell in
you <HI>richly.</HI>" This figurative use of the word,
though so familiar to St. Paul, does not oc∣cur
in any part of the New Testament, ex∣cept
once in the epistle of St. James, ch. ii.
ver. 5, "Hath not God chosen the <HI>poor</HI> of
this world, <HI>rich</HI> in faith?" where it is ma∣nifestly
suggested by the antithesis. I pro∣pose
<PB N="238" REF="240"/>
the frequent, yet seemingly unaffected
use of this phrase, in the epistle before us,
as one internal mark of its genuineness.</P>

<P>There is another singularity in St. Paul's
style, which, wherever it is found, may be
deemed a badge of authenticity; because, if
it were noticed, it would not, I think, be
imitated, inasmuch as it almost always pro∣duces
embarrassment and interruption in the
reasoning. This singularity is a species of
digression which may properly, I think, be
denominated <HI>going off at a word.</HI> It is
turning aside from the subject upon the oc∣currence
of some particular word, forsaking
the train of thought then in hand, and en∣tering
upon a parenthetic sentence in which
that word is the prevailing term. I shall
lay before the reader some examples of this,
collected from the other epistles, and then
propose two examples of it which are found
in the epistle to the Ephesians. 2 Cor. ch.
ii. ver. 14, at the word <HI>savour</HI>: "Now
thanks be unto God, which always causeth
us to triumph in Christ, and maketh ma∣nifest
<PB N="239" REF="241"/>
the <HI>savour</HI> of his knowledge by us
in every place (for we are unto God a
sweet <HI>savour</HI> of Christ, in them that are
saved, and in them that perish; to the
one we are the <HI>savour</HI> of death unto death,
and to the other the <HI>savour</HI> of life unto
life; and who is sufficient for these things?)
For we are not as many which corrupt the
word of God, but as of sincerity, but as
of God; in the sight of God speak we in
Christ." Again, 2 Cor. ch. iii. ver. 1, at
the word <HI>epistle</HI>: "Need we, as some others,
<HI>epistles</HI> of commendation to you, or of
commendation from you? (ye are our
<HI>epistle,</HI> written in our hearts, known and
read of all men; forasmuch as ye are ma∣nifestly
declared to be the <HI>epistle</HI> of Christ,
ministered by us, written not with ink,
but with the spirit of the living God; not
in tables of stone, but in the fleshly tables
of the heart." The position of the words
in the original, shews more strongly than
in the translation that it was the occurrence
of the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> which gave birth to
the sentence that follows: 2 Cor. chap. iii.
ver. 1. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="242"/>
Again, 2 Cor. ch. iii. ver. 12, &amp;c. at the
word <HI>vail</HI>: "Seeing then that we have such
hope, we use great plainness of speech:
and not as Moses, which put a <HI>vail</HI> over
his face, that the children of Israel could
not stedfastly look to the end of that
which is abolished. But their minds were
blinded; for until this day remaineth the
same <HI>vail</HI> untaken away in the reading of
the Old Testament, which <HI>vail</HI> is done
away in Christ; but even unto this day,
when Moses is read, the <HI>vail</HI> is upon their
heart: nevertheless, when it shall turn to
the Lord, the <HI>vail</HI> shall be taken away
(now the Lord is that spirit; and where
the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty).
But we all, with open face, beholding as
in a glass the glory of the Lord, are
<PB N="241" REF="243"/>
changed into the same image from glory
to glory, even as by the spirit of the Lord.
Therefore, seeing we have this ministry, as
we have received mercy, we faint not."</P>
<P>Who sees not that this whole allegory of
the <HI>vail</HI> arises entirely out of the occurrence
of the word, in telling us that "Moses put
a <HI>vail</HI> over his face," and that it drew the
apostle away from the proper subject of his
discourse, the dignity of the office in which
he was engaged: which subject he fetches
up again almost in the words, with which
he had left it; "therefore, seeing we have
this ministry, as we have received mercy,
we faint not?" The sentence which he
had before been going on with, and in which
he had been interrupted by the <HI>vail,</HI> was,
"seeing then that we have such hope, we
use great plainness of speech."</P>
<P>In the epistle to the Ephesians, the reader
will remark two instances, in which the same
habit of composition obtains; he will re∣cognize
the same pen. One he will find,
chap. iv. ver. 8-11, at the word <HI>ascended</HI>:
"Wherefore he saith, When he <HI>ascended</HI> up
on high, he led captivity captive, and gave
<PB N="242" REF="244"/>
gifts unto men. (Now that he <HI>ascended,</HI>
what is it but that he also descended first
unto the lower parts of the earth? He
that descended is the same also that <HI>ascended</HI>
up far above all heavens, that he might
fill all things). And he gave some, apo∣stles,"
&amp;c.</P>
<P>The other appears, chap. v. ver. 12-15,
at the word <HI>light</HI>: "For it is a shame even
to speak of those things which are done
of them in secret: but all things that are
reproved, are made manifest by the <HI>light</HI>;
(for whatsoever doth make manifest, is
<HI>light</HI>; wherefore he saith, Awake, thou
that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and
Christ shall give thee <HI>light</HI>:) see then that
ye walk circumspectly."</P>

<HEAD>No. IV.</HEAD>
<P>Although it does not appear to have ever
been disputed that the epistle before us was
written by St. Paul, yet it is well known
that a doubt has long been entertained
concerning the persons to whom it was ad∣dressed.
The question is founded partly in
<PB N="243" REF="245"/>
some ambiguity in the external evidence.
Marcion, a heretic of the second century,
as quoted by Tertullian, a father in the
beginning of the third, calls it the epistle to
the Laodiceans. From what we know of
Marcion, his judgment is little to be relied
upon; nor is it perfectly clear that Marcion
was rightly understood by Tertullian. If,
however, Marcion be brought to prove that
some copies in his time gave <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
in the superscription, his testimony, if it be
truly interpreted, is not diminished by his
heresy; for, as Grotius observes, "<HI>cur in eâ
re mentiretur nihil erat causae.</HI>" The name
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, in the first verse, upon which
word singly depends the proof that the
epistle was written to the Ephesians, is not
read in all the manuscripts now extant. I
admit, however, that the external evidence
preponderates with a manifest excess on the
side of the received reading. The objection
therefore principally arises from the contents
of the epistle itself, which, in many respects,
militate with the supposition that it was
written to the church of Ephesus. Accord∣ing
to the history, St. Paul had passed two
<PB N="244" REF="246"/>
whole years at Ephesus, Acts, chap. xix.
ver. 10. And in this point, viz. of St. Paul
having preached for a considerable length of
time at Ephesus, the history is confirmed by
the two epistles to the Corinthians, and by
the two epistles to Timothy: "I will tarry
at <HI>Ephesus</HI> until Pentecost," 1 Cor. chap. xvi.
ver. 8. "We would not have you ignorant
of our trouble which came to us in <HI>Asia,</HI>"
2 Cor. chap. i. ver. 8; "As I besought thee
to abide still at <HI>Ephesus,</HI> when I went into
Macedonia," 1 Tim. chap. i. ver. 3. "And
in how many things he ministered to me
at <HI>Ephesus</HI> thou knowest well," 2 Tim.
chap. i. ver. 18. I adduce these testimonies,
because, had it been a competition of credit
between the history and the epistle, I should
have thought myself bound to have prefer∣red
the epistle. Now, every epistle which
St. Paul wrote to churches, which he him∣self
had founded, or which he had visited,
abounds with references, and appeals to what
had passed during the time that he was pre∣sent
amongst them; whereas there is not a
text in the epistle to the Ephesians, from
which we can collect that he had ever been
<PB N="245" REF="247"/>
at Ephesus at all. The two epistles to the
Corinthians, the epistle to the Galatians, the
epistle to the Philippians, and the two epi∣stles
to the Thessalonians, are of this class;
and they are full of allusions to the apostle's
history, his reception, and his conduct, whilst
amongst them; the total want of which, in
the epistle before us, is very difficult to ac∣count
for, if it was in truth written to the
church of Ephesus, in which city he had
resided for so long a time. This is the first
and strongest objection. But farther, the
epistle to the Colossians was addressed to a
church, in which St. Paul had never been.
This we infer from the first verse of the se∣cond
chapter: "For I would that ye knew
what great conflict I have for you and for
them at Laodicea, and for as many as have
not seen my face in the flesh." There
could be no propriety in thus joining the
Colossians and Laodiceans with those "who
had not seen his face in the flesh," if they
did not also belong to the same description<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Lardner contends against the validity of this conclusion; but, I think, without success. LARDNER, Vol. XIV. p. 473, edit. 1757.</NOTE>.
<PB N="246" REF="248"/>
Now, his address to the Colossians, whom
he had not-visited, is precisely the same as
his address to the Christians, to whom he
wrote in the epistle, which we are now con∣sidering:
"We give thanks to God and the
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying
always for you, <HI>since we heard of your faith</HI>
in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye
have to all the saints," Col. chap. i. ver. 3.
Thus he speaks to the Colossians, in the
epistle before us, as follows: "Wherefore I
also, <HI>after I heard of your faith</HI> in the Lord
Jesus, and love unto all the saints, cease
not to give thanks for you in my prayers,"
chap. i. ver. 15. The terms of this address
are observable. The words "having <HI>heard</HI>
of your faith and love," are the very words,
we see, which he uses towards strangers;
and it is not probable that he should em∣ploy
the same in accosting a church in which
he had long exercised his ministry, and whose
"faith and love" he must have personally
known<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Locke endeavours to avoid this difficulty, by explaining "<HI>their faith,</HI> of which St. Paul had heard," to mean the steadfastness of their persuasion that they were called into the kingdom of God, without subjection to the Mosaic institution. But this interpretation seems to me extremely <HI>hard</HI>; for, in the manner in which faith is here joined with love, in the expression, "your faith and love," it could not be meant to denote any particu∣lar tenet which distinguished one set of Christians from others; forasmuch as the expression describes the general virtues of the Christian profession. Vide LOCKE in loc.</NOTE>. The epistle to the Romans was
<PB N="247" REF="249"/>
written before St. Paul had been at Rome;
and his address to them runs in the same
strain with that just now quoted: "I thank
my God, through Jesus Christ, for you
all, that your faith is <HI>spoken of</HI> throughout
the whole world," Rom. chap. i. ver. 8.
Let us now see what was the form in which
our apostle was accustomed to introduce his
epistles, when he wrote to those with whom
he was already acquainted. To the Corin∣thians
it was this: "I thank my God al∣ways
on your behalf, for the grace of
God which is given you by Christ Jesus,"
1 Cor. chap. i. ver. 4. To the Philippians:
"I thank my God upon every remembrance
of you," Phil. chap. i. ver. 3. To the Thes∣salonians:
"We give thanks to God always
for you all, making mention of you in
<PB N="248" REF="250"/>
our prayers, remembering without ceasing
your work of faith, and labour of love,"
1 Thess. chap. i. ver. 3. To Timothy:
"I thank God, whom I serve from my fore∣fathers
with pure conscience, that without
ceasing I have remembrance of thee in
my prayers night and day," 2 Tim. chap.
i. ver. 4. In these quotations, it is usually
his <HI>remembrance,</HI> and never his <HI>hearing</HI> of
them, which he makes the subject of his
thankfulness to God.</P>
<P>As great difficulties stand in the way of
supposing the epistle before us to have been
written to the church of Ephesus, so I think
it probable that it is actually the epistle to
the Laodiceans, referred to in the fourth
chapter of the epistle to the Colossians. The
text which contains that reference is this:
"When this epistle is read among you, cause
that it be read also in the church of the
Laodiceans, and that ye likewise read the
epistle from Laodicea," chap. iv. ver. 16.
The "epistle <HI>from</HI> Laodicea" was an epistle
sent by St. Paul to that church, and by them
transmitted to Colosse. The two churches
were mutually to communicate the epistles
<PB N="249" REF="251"/>
they had received. This is the way in
which the direction is explained by the
greater part of commentators, and is the
most probable sense that can be given to it.
It is also probable that the epistle alluded to
was an epistle which had been received by
the church of Laodicea <HI>lately.</HI> It appears
then, with a considerable degree of evidence,
that there existed an epistle of St. Paul's
nearly of the same date with the epistle to
the Colossians, and an epistle directed to a
church (for such the church of Laodicea
was) in which St. Paul had never been.
What has been observed concerning the
epistle before us, shews that it answers per∣fectly
to that character.</P>
<P>Nor does the mistake seem very difficult
to account for. Whoever inspects the map
of Asia Minor will see, that a person pro∣ceeding
from Rome to Laodicea would pro∣bably
land at Ephesus, as the nearest fre∣quented
sea-port in that direction. Might
not Tychicus then, in passing through Ephe∣sus,
communicate to the Christians of that
place the letter, with which he was charged?
And might not copies of that letter be mul∣tiplied
<PB N="250" REF="252"/>
and preserved at Ephesus? Might not
some of the copies drop the words of de∣signation
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">And it is remarkable that there seem to have been some ancient copies without the words of designation, either the words <HI>in Ephesus,</HI> or the words <HI>in Laodicea.</HI> St. Basil, a writer of the fourth century, speaking of the present epistle, has this very singular passage: "And writing to the Ephesians, as truly united to him who is through knowledge, he (Paul) calleth them in a peculiar sense <HI>such who are</HI>; saying, <HI>to the saints who are, and</HI> (or <HI>even</HI>) <HI>the faithful in Christ Jesus</HI>; for so those before us have transmitted it, and we have found it in ancient copies." Dr. Mill interprets (and, notwith∣standing some objections that have been made to him, in my opinion rightly interprets) these words of Basil, as de∣claring that this father had seen certain copies of the epistle in which the words "in Ephesus" were wanting. And the passage, I think, must be considered as Basil's fanciful way of explaining what was really a corrupt and defective reading; for I do not believe it possible that the author of the epistle could have originally written <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, without any name of place to follow it.</NOTE>, which it was of
no consequence to an Ephesian to retain?
Might not copies of the letter come out into
the Christian church at large from Ephesus;
and might not this give occasion to a belief
that the letter was written to that church?
And, lastly, might not this belief produce
<PB N="251" REF="253"/>
the error which we suppose to have crept
into the inscription?</P>

<P>As our epistle purports to have been writ∣ten
during St. Paul's imprisonment at Rome,
which lies beyond the period, to which the
Acts of the Apostles brings up his history;
and as we have seen and acknowledged that
the epistle contains no reference to any
transaction at Ephesus during the apostle's
residence in that city, we cannot expect that
it should supply many marks of agreement
with the narrative. One coincidence how∣ever
occurs, and a coincidence of that mi∣nute
and less obvious kind, which, as hath
been repeetedly observed, is of all others the
most to be relied upon.</P>
<P>Chap. vi. ver. 19, 20, we read, "praying
for me, that I may open my mouth boldly
to make known the mystery of the gospel,
for which I am an ambassador in bonds."
"<HI>In bonds,</HI>" <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, in a <HI>chain.</HI> In the
twenty-eighth chapter of the Acts we are in∣formed,
that Paul, after his arrival at Rome,
was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier,
<PB N="252" REF="254"/>
that kept him. Dr. Lardner has shewn that
this mode of custody was in use amongst
the Romans, and that whenever it was
adopted the prisoner was bound to the soldier
by a single chain; in reference to which
St. Paul, in the twentieth verse of this chap∣ter,
tells the Jews, whom he had assembled,
"For this cause therefore have I called for
you to see you, and to speak with you,
because that for the hope of Israel I am
bound <HI>with this chain,</HI>"
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. It is in exact conformity there∣fore
with the truth of St. Paul's situation at
the time, that he declares of himself in the
epistle, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. And the exactness
is the more remarkable, as <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (a chain)
is no where used in the singular number to
express any other kind of custody. When
the prisoner's hands or feet were bound to∣gether,
the word was <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (bonds), as in
the twenty-sixth chapter of the Acts, where
Paul replies to Agrippa, "I would to God
that not only thou, but also all that hear me
this day, were both almost, and altogether
such as I am, except <HI>these bonds,</HI>"
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. When the prisoner
<PB N="253" REF="255"/>
was confined between two soldiers, as in the
case of Peter, Acts, chap. xii. ver. 6, two
chains were employed; and it is said, upon
his miraculous deliverance, that the "chains"
(<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, in the plural) "fell from his hands."
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> the noun, and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> the verb,
being general terms, were applicable to this
in common with any other species of per∣sonal
coercion; but <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, in the singular
number, to none but this.</P>
<P>If it can be suspected that the writer of
the present epistle, who, in no other parti∣cular,
appears to have availed himself of the
information concerning St. Paul delivered in
the Acts, had, in this verse, borrowed the
word, which he read in that book, and had
adapted his expression to what he found
there recorded of St. Paul's treatment at
Rome; in short, that the coincidence here
noted was effected by craft and design; I
think it a strong reply to remark, that, in
the parallel passage of the epistle to the Co∣lossians,
the same allusion is not preserved:
the words there are, "praying also for us,
that God would open unto us a door of
utterance to speak the mystery of Christ,
<PB N="254" REF="256"/>
for which <HI>I am also in bonds,</HI>"
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. After what has been shewn in a
preceding number, there can be little doubt
but that these two epistles were written by
the same person. If the writer, therefore,
sought for, and fraudulently inserted, the
correspondency into one epistle, why did
he not do it in the other? A real prisoner
might use either general words, which com∣prehended
this amongst many other modes
of custody; or might use appropriate words
which specified this, and distinguished it
from any other mode. It would be acci∣dental
which form of expression he fell upon.
But an impostor, who had the art, in one
place, to employ the appropriate term for
the purpose of fraud, would have used it
in both places.</P>

<P>WHEN a transaction is referred to
in such a manner, as that the re∣ference
is easily and immediately understood
by those who are beforehand, or from other
quarters, acquainted with the fact, but is
obscure, or imperfect, or requires investiga∣tion,
or a comparison of different parts, in
order to be made clear to other readers, the
transaction so referred to is probably real;
because, had it been fictitious, the writer
would have set forth his story more fully
and plainly, not merely as conscious of the
fiction, but as conscious that his readers
could have no other knowledge of the sub∣ject
of his allusion than from the informa∣tion
of which he put them in possession.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="258"/>
The account of Epaphroditus, in the
epistle to the Philippians, of his journey to
Rome, and of the business, which brought
him thither, is the article to which I mean
to apply this observation. There are three
passages in the epistle, which relate to this
subject. The first, chap. i. ver. 7, "Even
as it is meet for me to think this of you
all, because I have you in my heart, inas∣much
as both in my bonds, and in the
defence and confirmation of the gospel,
ye all are <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, joint
contributors to the gift which I have re∣ceived<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pearce, I believe, was the first commentator who gave this sense to the expression; and I believe also, that his exposition is now generally assented to. He inter∣prets in the same sense the phrase in the fifth verse, which our translation renders, "your fellowship in the gospel;" but which in the original is not <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; but <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>."
Nothing more is said in this
place. In the latter part of the second chap∣ter,
and at the distance of half the epistle
from the last quotation, the subject appears
again: "Yet I supposed it necessary to send
to you Epaphroditus, my brother and
companion in labour, and fellow soldier,
<PB N="257" REF="259"/>
but your messenger, and <HI>he that ministered
to my wants</HI>: for he longed after you all,
and was full of heaviness, because that ye
had heard that he had been sick: for indeed
he was sick nigh unto death; but God
had mercy on him, and not on him only,
but on me also, lest I should have sorrow
upon sorrow. I sent him therefore the
more carefully, that when ye see him
again ye may rejoice, and that I may be
the less sorrowful. Receive him therefore
in the Lord with all gladness; and hold
such in reputation: because for the work
of Christ he was nigh unto death, not re∣garding
his life <HI>to supply your lack of service
toward me.</HI>" Chap. ii. ver. 25-30. The
matter is here dropped, and no farther
mention made of it till it is taken up near
the conclusion of the epistle as follows:
"But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that
now at the last your care of me hath
flourished again; wherein ye were also
careful, but ye lacked opportunity: not
that I speak in respect of want; for I have
learned in whatsoever state I am, there∣with
to be content. I know both how to
<PB N="258" REF="260"/>
be abased, and I know how to abound;
every where and in all things I am in∣structed
both to be full and to be hungry,
both to abound and to suffer need. I
can do all things through Christ which
strengtheneth me. Notwithstanding ye
have well done that ye did communicate
with my affliction. Now ye, Philippians,
know also that in the beginning of the
gospel, when I departed from Macedonia,
no church communicated with me as con∣cerning
giving and receiving, but ye only:
for even in Thessalonica ye sent once
and again unto my necessity: not because
I desire a gift; but I desire fruit that may
abound to your account. But I have all,
and abound; I am full, having received
of Epaphroditus the things which were
sent from you." Chap. iv. ver. 10-18.
To the Philippian reader, who knew that
contributions were wont to be made in that
church for the apostle's subsistence and re∣lief,
that the supply which they were ac∣customed
to send to him had been delayed
by the want of opportunity, that Epaphrodi∣tus
had undertaken the charge of conveying
<PB N="259" REF="261"/>
their liberality to the hands of the apostle,
that he had acquitted himself of this com∣mission
at the peril of his life, by hastening
to Rome under the oppression of a grievous
sickness; to a reader who knew all this
beforehand, every line in the above quota∣tions
would be plain and clear. But how
is it with a stranger? The knowledge of
these several particulars is necessary to the
perception and explanation of the references;
yet that knowledge must be gathered from
a comparison of passages lying at a great
distance from one another. Texts must be
interpreted by texts long subsequent to them,
which necessarily produces embarrassment
and suspense. The passage quoted from the
beginning of the epistle contains an ac∣knowledgment,
on the part of the apostle,
of the liberality which the Philippians had
exercised towards him; but the allusion
is so general and indeterminate, that had
nothing more been said in the sequel of
the epistle, it would hardly have been
applied to this occasion at all. In the se∣cond
quotation, Epaphroditus is declared
to have "ministered to the apostle's wants,"
<PB N="260" REF="262"/>
and "to have supplied their lack of service
towards him:" but <HI>how,</HI> that is, at whose
expence, or from what fund, he "ministered,"
or what was the "lack of service" which
he supplied, are left very much unexplained,
till we arrive at the third quotation, where
we find that Epaphroditus "ministered to
St. Paul's wants," only by conveying to
his hands the contributions of the Philip∣pians;
"I am full, having received of Epa∣phroditus
the things which were sent from
you:" and that "the lack of service
which he supplied" was a delay or inter∣ruption
of their accustomed bounty, occa∣sioned
by the want of opportunity; "I re∣joiced
in the Lord greatly, that now at
the last your care of me hath flourished
again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye
lacked opportunity." The affair at length
comes out clear; but it comes out by piece∣meal.
The clearness is the result of the re∣ciprocal
illustration of divided texts. Should
any one choose therefore to insinuate, that
this whole story of Epaphroditus, of his
journey, his errand, his sickness, or even
his existence, might, for what we know,
<PB N="261" REF="263"/>
have no other foundation than in the in∣vention
of the forger of the epistle; I an∣swer,
that a forger would have set forth his
story connectedly, and also more fully and
more perspicuously. If the epistle be authen∣tic,
and the transaction real, then every thing
which is said concerning Epaphroditus and
his commission, would be clear to those into
whose hands the epistle was expected to
come. Considering the Philippians as his
readers, a person might naturally write upon
the subject, as the author of the epistle has
written; but there is no supposition of for∣gery
with which it will suit.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>No. II.</HEAD>
<P>The history of Epaphroditus supplies an∣other
observation: "Indeed he was sick,
nigh unto death; but God had mercy on
him, and not on him only, but on me
also, lest I should have sorrow upon sor∣row."
In this passage, no intimation is
given that Epaphroditus's recovery was mi∣raculous.
It is plainly, I think, spoken of
as a natural event. This instance, together
<PB N="262" REF="264"/>
with one in the second epistle to Timothy
("Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick"),
affords a proof that the power of perform∣ing
cures, and, by parity of reason, of
working other miracles, was a power which
only visited the apostles occasionally, and
did not at all depend upon their own will.
Paul undoubtedly would have healed Epa∣phroditus
if he could. Nor, if the power
of working cures had awaited his disposal,
would he have left his fellow traveller at
Miletum sick. This, I think, is a fair ob∣servation
upon the instances adduced; but
it is not the observation I am concerned
to make. It is more for the purpose of my
argument to remark, that forgery, upon
such an occasion, would not have spared a
miracle; much less would it have intro∣duced
St. Paul professing the utmost anxiety
for the safety of his friend, yet acknow∣ledging
himself unable to help him: which
he does almost expressly, in the case of
Trophimus, for he "left him sick;" and
virtually in the passage before us, in which
he felicitates himself upon the recovery of
Epaphroditus, in terms which almost ex∣clude
<PB N="263" REF="265"/>
the supposition of any supernatural
means being employed to effect it. This
is a reserve which nothing but truth would
have imposed.</P>

I would render
the passage, so as to mark these different pe∣riods,
thus: "Now ye, Philippians, know also
that in the beginning of the gospel, when
I was departed from Macedonia, no church
communicated with me as concerning giv∣ing
and receiving, but ye only; and that
also in Thessalonica ye sent once and again
unto my necessity." Now with this ex∣position
of the passage compare 2 Cor. chap.
xi. ver. 8, 9: "I robbed other churches,
<PB N="265" REF="267"/>
taking wages of them to do you service:
and when I was present with you and
wanted, I was chargeable to no man; for
that which was lacking to me the bre∣thren
which came from Macedonia sup∣plied."</P>
<P>It appears from St. Paul's history, as re∣lated
in the Acts of the Apostles, that upon
leaving Macedonia he passed, after a very
short stay at Athens, into Achaia. It ap∣pears,
secondly, from the quotation out of
the epistle to the Corinthians, that in Achaia
he accepted no pecuniary assistance from the
converts of that country; but that he drew
a supply for his wants from the Macedo∣nian
Christians. Agreeably whereunto it
appears, in the third place, from the text
which is the subject of the present number,
that the brethren in Philippi, a city of Ma∣cedonia,
had followed him with their muni∣ficence,
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, when he
was departed from Macedonia, that is, when
he was <HI>come into Achaia.</HI></P>
<P>The passage under consideration affords
another circumstance of agreement deserving
of our notice. The gift alluded to in the epistle
<PB N="266" REF="268"/>
to the Philippians is stated to have been
made "in the beginning of the gospel."
This phrase is most naturally explained to
signify the first preaching of the gospel in
these parts; viz. on that side of the Aegean
sea. The succours referred to in the epistle
to the Corinthians, as received from Mace∣donia,
are stated to have been received by
him upon his first visit to the peninsula of
Greece. The dates therefore assigned to the
donation in the two epistles agree; yet is
the date in one ascertained very incident∣ally,
namely, by the considerations which
fix the date of the epistle itself; and in the
other, by an expression ("the beginning of
the gospel") much too general to have
been used, if the text had been penned with
any view to the correspondency we are re∣marking.</P>
<P>Farther, the phrase, "in the <HI>beginning</HI> of
the gospel," raises an idea in the reader's
mind, that the gospel had been preached
there more than once. The writer would
hardly have called the visit to which he
refers the "beginning of the gospel," if he
had not also visited them in some other stage
<PB N="267" REF="269"/>
of it. The fact corresponds with this idea.
If we consult the sixteenth and twentieth
chapters of the Acts, we shall find, that St.
Paul, before his imprisonment at Rome,
during which this epistle purports to have
been written, had been <HI>twice</HI> in Macedonia,
and each time at Philippi.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>No. IV.</HEAD>
<P>That Timothy had been alongwith St. Paul
at Philippi is a fact which seems to be im∣plied
in this epistle twice. First, he joins in
the salutation with which the epistle opens,
"Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus
Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which
are at Philippi." Secondly, and more di∣rectly,
the point is inferred from what is said
concerning him, chap. ii. ver. 19: "But
I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timo∣theus
shortly unto you, that I also may
be of good comfort when I know your
state; for I have no man like minded,
who will naturally care for your state;
for all seek their own, not the things
<PB N="268" REF="270"/>
which are Jesus Christ's: but <HI>ye know the
proof of him,</HI> that as a son with the father,
he hath served with me in the gospel."
Had Timothy's presence with St. Paul at
Philippi, when he preached the gospel there,
been expressly remarked in the Acts of the
Apostles, this quotation might be thought
to contain a contrived adaptation to the his∣tory;
although, even in that case, the aver∣ment,
or rather the allusion in the epistle,
is too oblique to afford much room for such
suspicion. But the truth is, that in the his∣tory
of St. Paul's transactions at Philippi,
which occupies the greatest part of the
sixteenth chapter of the Acts, no mention
is made of Timothy at all. What appears
concerning Timothy in the history, so far
as relates to the present subject, is this:
"When Paul came to Derbe and Lystra,
behold a certain disciple was there named
Timotheus, whom Paul would have to go
forth with him." The narrative then
proceeds with the account of St. Paul's pro∣gress
through various provinces of the Lesser
Asia, till it brings him down to Troas. At
Troas he was warned in a vision to pass
<PB N="269" REF="271"/>
over into Macedonia. In obedience to which
he crossed the Aegean sea to Samothracia,
the next day to Neapolis, and from thence
to Philippi. His preaching, miracles, and
perfecutions at Philippi follow next; after
which Paul and his company, when they
had passed through Amphipolis and Apol∣lonia,
came to Thessalonica, and from Thes∣salonica
to Beraea. From Beraea the bre∣thren
sent away Paul; "but Silas and
"<HI>Timotheus</HI> abode there still." he iti∣nerary,
of which the above is an abstract,
is undoubtedly sufficient to support an in∣ference
that Timothy was along with St.
Paul at Philippi. We find them setting out
together upon this progress from Derbe, in
Lycaonia; we find them together, near the
conclusion of it, at Beraea, in Macedonia.
It is highly probable, therefore, that they
came together to Philippi, through which
their route between these two places lay.
If this be thought probable, it is sufficient.
For what I wish to be observed is, that in
comparing, upon this subject, the epistle
with the history, we do not find a recital in
one place of what is related in another;
<PB N="270" REF="272"/>
but that we find, what is much more to be
relied upon, an oblique allusion to an im∣plied
fact.</P>

<P>Our epistle purports to have been written
near the conclusion of St. Paul's imprison∣ment
at Rome, and after a residence in that
city of considerable duration. These cir∣cumstances
are made out by different inti∣mations,
and the intimations upon the sub∣ject
preserve among themselves a just con∣sistency,
and a consistency certainly unme∣ditated.
First, the apostle had already been
a prisoner at Rome so long, as that the re∣putation
of his bonds, and of his constancy
under them, had contributed to advance the
success of the gospel: "But I would ye
should understand, brethren, that the things
which happened unto me have fallen out
rather unto the furtherance of the gospel;
so that my bonds in Christ are manifest in
all the palace, and in all other places; and
many of the brethren in the Lord waxing
consident by my bonds, are much more
<PB N="271" REF="273"/>
bold to speak the word without fear."
Secondly, the account given of Epaphrodi∣tus
imports, that St. Paul, when he wrote the
epistle, had been in Rome a considerable
time: "He longed after you all, and was
full of heaviness, because that ye had
heard that he had been sick." Epaphro∣ditus
was with St. Paul at Rome. He had
been sick. The Philippians had heard of his
sickness, and he again had received an ac∣count
how much they had been affected by
the intelligence. The passing and repassing
of these advices must necessarily have occu∣pied
a large portion of time, and must have
all taken place during St. Paul's residence at
Rome. Thirdly, after a residence at Rome
thus proved to have been of considerable
duration, he now regards the decision of his
fate as nigh at hand. He contemplates ei∣ther
alternative, that of his deliverance,
ch. ii. ver. 23, "Him therefore (Timothy) I
hope to send <HI>presently,</HI> so soon as I shall see
how it will go with me; but I trust in the
Lord that I also myself shall come shortly:"
that of his condemnation, ver. 17, "Yea, and
<PB N="272" REF="274"/>
if I be offered<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, if my blood be poured out as a libation upon the sacrifice of your faith.</NOTE> upon the sacrifice and ser∣vice
of your faith, I joy and rejoice with
you all." This consistency is material, if the
consideration of it be confined to the epistle.
It is farther material, as it agrees, with re∣spect
to the duration of St. Paul's first im∣prisonment
at Rome, with the account deli∣vered
in the Acts, which, having brought
the apostle to Rome, closes the history by
telling us "that he dwelt there <HI>two whole
years</HI> in his own hired house."</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="6" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>No. VI.</HEAD>
<P>Chap. i. ver. 23. "For I am in a strait
betwixt two, having a desire to depart,
and to be with Christ; which is far better."</P>
<P>With this compare 2 Cor. chap. v. ver. 8.
"We are confident and willing rather to be
absent from the body, and to be present
with the Lord."</P>
<P>The sameness of sentiment in these two
quotations is obvious. I rely however not
so much upon that, as upon the similitude
<PB N="273" REF="275"/>
in the train of thought which in each
epistle leads up to this sentiment, and upon
the suitableness of that train of thought to
the circumstances under which the epistles
purport to have been written. This, I
conceive, bespeaks the production of the
same mind, and of a mind operating upon
real circumstances. The sentiment is in
both places preceded by the contemplation
of imminent personal danger. To the
Philippians he writes, in the twentieth
verse of this chapter, "According to my
earnest expectation and my hope, that in
nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with
all boldness, as always, <HI>so now also,</HI> Christ
shall be magnified in my body, whether
it be by life or by death." To the Co∣rinthians,
"Troubled on every side, yet not
distressed; perplexed, but not in despair;
persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down,
but not destroyed; always bearing about
in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus."
This train of reflection is continued to the
place from whence the words which we
compare are taken. The two epistles,
though written at different times, from dif∣ferent
<PB N="274" REF="276"/>
places, and to different churches,
were both written under circumstances
which would naturally recal to the au∣thor's
mind the precarious condition of his
life, and the perils which constantly await∣ed
him. When the epistle to the Philip∣pians
was written, the author was a pri∣soner
at home, expecting his trial. When
the second epistle to the Corinthians was
written, he had lately escaped a danger in
which he had given himself over for lost.
The epistle opens with a recollection of this
subject, and the impression accompanied
the writer's thoughts throughout.</P>
<P>I know that nothing is easier than to
transplant into a forged epistle a sentiment
or expression which is found in a true one;
or, supposing both epistles to be forged by
the same hand, to insert the same sentiment
or expression in both. But the difficulty is
to introduce it in just and close connection
with the train of thought going before, and
with a train of thought apparently gene∣rated
by the circumstances under which the
epistle is written. In two epistles, purport∣ing
to be written on different occasions,
<PB N="275" REF="277"/>
and in different periods of the author's his∣tory,
this propriety would not easily be ma∣naged.</P>

<P>Chap. i. 29, 30; ii. 1, 2. "For unto
you is given in the behalf of Christ, not
only to believe on him, but also to suffer
for his sake, having the same conflict which
<HI>ye saw in me,</HI> and now hear to be in me.
If there be, therefore, any consolation
in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any
fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels
and mercies: fulfil ye my joy; that ye be
like minded, having the same love, being
of one accord, of one mind."</P>
<P>With this compare Acts xvi. 22: "And
the multitude (at Philippi) rose up against
them (Paul and Silas); and the magistrates
rent off their clothes, and commanded to
beat them; and when they had laid many
stripes upon them, they cast them into
prison, charging the jailer to keep them
safely; who having received such a
<PB N="276" REF="278"/>
charge, thrust them into the inner
prison, and made their feet fast in the
stocks."</P>
<P>The passage in the epistle is very remark∣able.
I know not an example in any writ∣ing
of a juster pathos, or which more truly
represents the workings of a warm and affec∣tionate
mind, than what is exhibited in the
quotation before us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The original is very spirited. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>. The apostle reminds
his Philippians of their being joined with
himself in the endurance of persecution for
the sake of Christ. He conjures them, by
the ties of their common profession and
their common sufferings, to "fulfil his joy;"
to complete, by the unity of their faith, and
by their mutual love, that joy with which
the instances he had received of their zeal
and attachment had inspired his breast.
Now if this was the real effusion of St.
Paul's mind, of which it bears the strongest
internal character, then we have in the
<PB N="277" REF="279"/>
words "the same conflict which ye saw in
me," an authentic confirmation of so
much of the apostle's history in the Acts,
as relates to his transactions at Philippi;
and through that of the intelligence and ge∣neral
fidelity of the historian.</P>

<HEAD>THE EPISTLE TO THE COLOSSIANS.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>No. I.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is a circumstance of conformity
between St. Paul's history and his
letters, especially those which were written
during his first imprisonment at Rome,
and more especially the epistles to the Co∣lossians
and Ephesians, which, being too
close to be accounted for from accident,
yet too indirect and latent to be imputed to
design, cannot easily be resolved into any
other original than truth. Which circum∣stance
is this, that St. Paul in these epistles
attributes his imprisonment not to his
preaching of Christianity, but to his as∣serting
the right of the Gentiles to be ad∣mitted
into it without conforming them∣selves
to the Jewish law. This was the
doctrine to which he considered himself as
a martyr. Thus in the epistle before us,
<PB N="279" REF="281"/>
chap. i. ver. 24. (I Paul) "who now rejoice
in my sufferings for you"—"<HI>for you,</HI>" i.e.
for those whom he had never seen; for a
few verses afterwards he adds, "I would
that ye knew what great conflict I have
for you, and for them in Laodicea, and
for as many as have not seen my face
in the flesh." His sufferings therefore
for <HI>them</HI> was, in their general capacity of
Gentile Christians, agreeably to what he
explicitly declares in his epistle to the
Ephesians, iv. 1. "For this cause, I Paul,
the prisoner of Jesus Christ, <HI>for you Gen∣tiles.</HI>"
Again in the epistle now under
consideration, iv. 3. "Withal praying
also for us, that God would open unto us
a door of utterance to speak the <HI>mystery</HI>
of Christ, for which I am also in bonds."
What that "mystery of Christ" was, the
epistle to the Ephesians distinctly informs
us; "whereby when ye read ye may
understand my knowledge in the <HI>mystery
of Christ,</HI> which, in other ages, was not
made known unto the sons of men, as it
is now revealed unto his holy apostles
and prophets by the Spirit, <HI>that the Gen∣tiles</HI>
<PB N="280" REF="282"/><HI>should be fellow-heirs, and of the same
body, and partakers of his promise in Christ
by the gospel.</HI>" This, therefore, was the
<HI>confession</HI> for which he declares himself to
be in bonds. Now let us enquire how the
occasion of St. Paul's imprisonment is re∣presented
in the history. The apostle had
not long returned to Jerusalem from his se∣cond
visit into Greece, when an uproar
was excited in that city by the clamour of
certain Asiatic Jews, who, "having seen
Paul in the temple, stirred up all the
people, and laid hands on him." The
charge advanced against him was, that "he
taught all men every where against the
people, and the law, and this place;
and farther brought Greeks also into
the temple, and polluted that holy
place." The former part of the charge
seems to point at the doctrine, which he
maintained, of the admission of the Gen∣tiles,
under the new dispensation, to an in∣discriminate
participation of God's favour
with the Jews. But what follows makes the
matter clear. When, by the interference
of the chief captain, Paul had been rescued
<PB N="281" REF="283"/>
out of the hands of the populace, and was
permitted to address the multitude who had
followed him to the stairs of the castle, he
delivered a brief account of his birth, of
the early course of his life, of his miracu∣lous
conversion; and is proceeding in his
narrative, until he comes to describe a vi∣sion
which was presented to him, as he
was praying in the temple; and which bid
him depart out of Jerusalem, "for I will
send thee far hence <HI>unto the Gentiles.</HI>" Acts
xxii. 21. "They gave him audience,"
says the historian, "<HI>unto this word</HI>; and
then lift up their voices, and said, Away
with such a fellow from the earth." No∣thing
can shew more strongly than this ac∣count
does, what was the offence which
drew down upon St. Paul the vengeance of
his countrymen. His mission to the Gen∣tiles,
and his open avowal of that mission,
was the intolerable part of the apostle's
crime. But although the real motive of the
prosecution appears to have been the Apo∣stle's
conduct towards the Gentiles; yet,
when his accusers came before a Roman
magistrate, a charge was to be framed of a
<PB N="282" REF="284"/>
more legal form. The profanation of the
temple was the article they chose to rely
upon. This, therefore, became the imme∣diate
subject of Tertullus's oration before
Felix, and of Paul's defence. But that he
all along considered his ministry amongst
the Gentiles as the actual source of the en∣mity
that had been exercised against him,
and in particular as the cause of the insur∣rection
in which his person had been seized,
is apparent from the conclusion of his dis∣course
before Agrippa: "I have appeared
unto thee," says he, describing what pass∣ed
upon his journey to Damascus, "for this
purpose, to make thee a minister and a wit∣ness,
both of these things which thou hast
seen, and of those things in the which I
will appear unto thee, delivering thee
from the people and from the Gentiles,
unto whom now I send thee, to open
their eyes and to turn them from dark∣ness
to light, and from the power of
Satan unto God, that they may receive
forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among
them which are sanctified by faith that is
in me. Whereupon, O King Agrippa,
<PB N="283" REF="285"/>
I was not disobedient unto the heavenly
vision; but shewed first unto them of
Damascus, and of Jerusalem, and through∣out
all the coasts of Judea, and then to
the Gentiles, that they should repent and
turn to God, and do works meet for
repentance. <HI>For these causes</HI> the Jews
caught me in the temple, and went about
to kill me." The seizing, therefore, of
St. Paul's person, from which he was
never discharged till his final liberation at
Rome; and of which, therefore, his impri∣sonment
at Rome was the continuation and
effect, was not in consequence of any ge∣neral
persecution set on foot against Chris∣tianity;
nor did it befal him simply, as
professing or teaching Christ's religion,
which James and the elders at Jerusalem
did as well as he (and yet for any thing
that appears remained at that time unmo∣lested);
but it was distinctly and specifically
brought upon him by his activity in preach∣ing
to the Gentiles, and by his boldly
placing them upon a level with the once∣favoured
and still self-slattered posterity of
Abraham. How well St. Paul's letters,
<PB N="284" REF="286"/>
purporting to be written during this im∣prisonment,
agree with this account of
its cause and origin, we have already
seen.</P>

<P>Chap. iv. ver. 10. "Aristarchus my fel∣low-prisoner
saluteth you, and Marcus sis∣ter's
son to Barnabas, touching whom ye
received commandments; if he come
unto you, receive him, and Jesus, which
is called Justus, who are of the circum∣cision."</P>
<P>We find Aristarchus as a companion of
our apostle in the nineteenth chapter of the
Acts, and the twenty-ninth verse: "And
the whole city of Ephesus was filled with
confusion; and having caught Gaius and
<HI>Aristarchus,</HI> men of Macedonia, <HI>Paul's
companions in travel,</HI> they rushed with one
accord into the theatre." And we find him
upon his journey with St. Paul to Rome, in
the twenty-seventh chapter, and the second
verse: "And when it was determined that
we should sail into Italy, they delivered
<PB N="285" REF="287"/>
Paul and certain other prisoners unto one
named Julius, a centurion of Augustus's
band; and, entering into a ship of Adra∣myttium,
we launched, meaning to sail
by the coast of Asia; one <HI>Aristarchus, a
Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.</HI>"
But might not the author of the epistle have
consulted the history; and, observing that
the historian had brought Aristarchus
along with Paul to Rome, might he not for
that reason, and without any other soun∣dation,
have put down his name amongst
the salutations of an epistle, purporting to
be written by the apostle from that place?
I allow so much of possibility to this objec∣tion,
that I should not have proposed this
in the number of coincidences clearly unde∣signed,
had Aristarchus stood alone. The
observation that strikes me in reading the
passage is, that together with Aristarchus,
whose journey to Rome we trace in the
history, are joined Marcus and Justus, of
whose coming to Rome the history says
nothing. Aristarchus alone appears in the
history, and Aristarchus alone would have
appeared in the epistle, if the author had
<PB N="286" REF="288"/>
regulated himself by that conformity. Or
if you take it the other way; if you suppose
the history to have been made out of the
epistle, why the journey of Aristarchus to
Rome should be recorded, and not that of
Marcus and Justus, if the groundwork of
the narrative was the appearance of Ari∣starchus's
name in the epistle, seems to be
unaccountable.</P>
<P>"Marcus, <HI>sister's son</HI> to Barnabas." Does
not this hint account for Barnabas's adhe∣rence
to Mark in the contest that arose with
our apostle concerning him? "And some
days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us
go again and visit our brethren in every
city where we have preached the word
of the Lord, and see how they do: and
<HI>Barnabas determined to take with them
John, whose surname was Mark</HI>; but
Paul thought not good to take him with
them, who departed from Pamphylia, and
went not with them to the work; and the
contention was so sharp between them, that
they departed asunder one from the other;
and so Barnabas took Mark and sailed
unto Cyprus." The history which records
<PB N="287" REF="289"/>
the dispute has not preserved the circum∣stance
of Mark's relationship to Barnabas.
It is not where noticed but in the text before
us. As far, therefore, as it applies, the ap∣plication
is certainly undesigned.</P>
<P>"<HI>Sister's</HI> son to Barnabas." This woman,
the mother of Mark, and the sister of Bar∣nabas,
was, as might be expected, a person
of some eminence amongst the Christians of
Jerusalem. It so happens that we hear
of her in the history. "When Peter was
delivered from prison, he came to the
house of <HI>Mary the mother of John, whose
surname was Mark,</HI> where many were
gathered together praying." Acts xii. 12.
There is somewhat of coincidence in this;
somewhat bespeaking real transactions
amongst real persons.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>No. III.</HEAD>
<P>The following coincidence, though it
bear the appearance of great nicety and re∣sinement,
ought not, perhaps, to be deem∣ed
imaginary. In the salutations with which
this, like most of St. Paul's epistles, con∣cludes,
we have "Aristarchus and Marcus,
<PB N="288" REF="290"/>
and Jesus, which is called Justus, <HI>who
are of the circumcision</HI>" (iv. 10, 11). Then
follow also "Epaphras, Luke the beloved
physician, and Demas." Now as this de∣scription,
"who are of the circumcision," is
added after the three first names, it is inferred,
not without great appearance of probability,
that the rest, amongst whom is Luke, were
not of the circumcision. Now can we dis∣cover
any expression in the Acts of the
Apostles, which ascertains whether the
author of the book was a Jew or not? If
we can discover that he was not a Jew, we
fix a circumstance in his character, which
coincides with what is here, indirectly in∣deed,
but not very uncertainly, intimated
concerning Luke: and we so far confirm
both the testimony of the primitive church,
that the Acts of the Apostles was written
by St. Luke, and the general reality of the
persons and circumstances brought toge∣ther
in this epistle. The text in the Acts,
which has been construed to shew that the
writer was not a Jew, is the nineteenth
verse of the first chapter, where, in describ∣ing
the field which had been purchased with
<PB N="289" REF="291"/>
the reward of Judas's iniquity, it is said,
"that it was known unto all the dwellers
at Jerusalem; insomuch as that field is
called, in <HI>their</HI> proper tongue, Aceldama,
that is to say, the field of blood." These
words are by most commentators taken to be
the words and observation of the historian,
and not a part of St. Peter's speech, in the
midst of which they are found. If this be
admitted, then it is argued that the expres∣sion,
"in <HI>their</HI> proper tongue," would not
have been used by a Jew, but is suitable to
the pen of a Gentile writing concerning
Jews<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Benson's Dissertation, vol. i. p. 318 of his works, Ed. 1756.</NOTE>. The reader will judge of the pro∣bability
of this conclusion, and we urge
the coincidence no farther than that proba∣bility
extends. The coincidence, if it be
one, is so remote from all possibility of de∣sign,
that nothing need be added to satisfy
the reader upon that part of the argument.</P>

<P>Chap. iv. ver. 9. "With Onesimus, a
faithful and beloved brother, <HI>who is one of
you.</HI>"</P>
<P>Observe how it may be made out that
Onesimus was a Colossian. Turn to the
epistle to Philemon, and you will find that
Onesimus was the servant or slave of Phile∣mon.
The question therefore will be to
what city Philemon belonged. In the
epistle addressed to him this is not de∣clared.
It appears only that he was of the
same place, whatever that place was, with
an eminent christian named Archippus.
"Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Ti∣mothy
our brother, unto Philemon our
dearly beloved and fellow-labourer; and to
our beloved Apphia, and <HI>Archippus</HI> our
fellow-soldier, and to the church in thy
house." Now turn back to the epistle to
the Colossians, and you will find Archippus
saluted by name amongst the Christians of
that church. "Say to Archippus, take
<PB N="291" REF="293"/>
heed to the ministry which thou hast
received in the Lord that thou fulsil it"
(iv. 17). The necessary result is, that
Onesimus also was of the same city, agree∣ably
to what is said of him, "he is one of
you." And this result is the effect, ei∣ther
of truth which produces consistency
without the writer's thought or care, or of
a contexture of forgeries confirming and
falling in with one another by a species of
fortuity of which I know no example.
The supposition of design, I think, is ex∣cluded,
not only because the purpose to
which the design must have been directed,
viz. the verification of the passage in our
epistle, in which it is said concerning One∣simus,
"he is one of you," is a purpose
which would be lost upon ninety-nine
readers out of a hundred; but because the
means made use of are too circuitous to
have been the subject of affectation and
contrivance. Would a forger, who had
this purpose in view, have left his readers
to hunt it out, by going forward and back∣ward
from one epistle to another, in order
<PB N="292" REF="294"/>
to connect Onesimus with Philemon, Phi∣lemon
with Archippus, and Archippus
with Colosse? all which he must do before
he arrive at his discovery, that it was truly
said of Onesimus, "he is one of you."</P>

<P>IT is known to every reader of scripture,
that the first epistle to the Thessalonians
speaks of the coming of Christ in terms
which indicate an expectation of his speedy
appearance: "For this we say unto you by
the word of the Lord, that <HI>we</HI> which are
alive and remain unto the coming of the
Lord shall not prevent them which are
asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend
from heaven with a shout, with the voice
of the archangel, and with the trump of
God, and the dead in Christ shall rise
first; then <HI>we which are alive and re∣main,</HI>
shall be caught up together with them
in the clouds—But ye, brethren, are not
in darkness, that that day should overtake
you as a thief" (chap. iv. 15, 16, 17.
chap. v. ver. 4).</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="296"/>
Whatever other construction these texts
may <HI>bear,</HI> the idea they leave upon the
mind of an ordinary reader, is that of the
author of the epistle looking for the day of
judgment to take place in his own time, or
near to it. Now the use which I make of this
circumstance, is to deduce from it a proof
that the epistle itself was not the production
of a subsequent age. Would an impostor
have given this expectation to St. Paul, af∣ter
experience had proved it to be erroneous?
or would he have put into the apostle's
mouth, or, which is the same thing, into writ∣ings
purporting to come from his hand, ex∣pressions,
if not necessarily conveying, at
least easily interpreted to convey, an opinion
which was then known to be founded in
mistake? I state this as an argument to
shew that the epistle was cotemporary with
St. Paul, which is little less than to shew
that it actually proceeded from his pen.
For I question whether any ancient forge∣ries
were executed in the life-time of the
person whose name they bear; nor was the
primitive situation of the church likely to
give birth to such an attempt.</P>

<P>Our epistle concludes with a direction,
that it should be publickly read in the church
to which it was addressed: "I charge
you by the Lord, that this epistle be read
unto all the holy brethren." The ex∣istence
of this clause in the body of the
epistle is an evidence of its authenticity;
because to produce a letter purporting to
have been publickly read in the church of
Thessalonica, when no such letter in truth
had been read or heard of in that church,
would be to produce an imposture destruc∣tive
of itself. At least, it seems unlikely
that the author of an imposture would vo∣luntarily,
and even officiously, afford a handle
to so plain an objection. Either the epistle
was publickly read in the church of Thes∣salonica
during St. Paul's life-time, or it was
not. If it was, no publication could be
more authentic, no species of notoriety more
unquestionable, no method of preserving the
integrity of the copy more secure. If it
was not, the clause we produce would re∣main
<PB N="296" REF="298"/>
a standing condemnation of the for∣gery,
and, one would suppose, an invinci∣ble
impediment to its success.</P>
<P>If we connect this article with the pre∣ceding,
we shall perceive that they com∣bine
into one strong proof of the genuine∣ness
of the epistle. The preceding article
carries up the date of the epistle to the time
of St. Paul; the present article sixes the pub∣lication
of it to the church of Thessalonica.
Either therefore the church of Thessalo∣nica
was imposed upon by a false epistle,
which in St. Paul's life-time they received
and read publickly as his, carrying on a
communication with him all the while, and
the epistle referring to the continuance of
that communication; or other Christian
churches, in the same life-time of the apo∣stle,
received an epistle purporting to have
been publickly read in the church of Thes∣salonica,
which nevertheless had not been
heard of in that church; or lastly, the con∣clusion
remains, that the epistle now in our

that, after Paul and Silas had been beaten
with many stripes at Philippi, shut up in the
inner prison, and their feet made fast in
the stocks, as soon as they were discharged
from their consinement they departed from
thence, and, when they had passed through
Amphipolis and Apollonia, came to Thes∣salonica,
where Paul opened and alledged
that Jesus was the Christ, Acts xvi. 23, &amp;c.
The epistle written in the name of Paul and
Sylvanus (Silas), and of Timotheus, who
also appears to have been along with them
at Philippi, (vide Phil. No. iv.) speaks to the
church of Thessalonica thus: "Even after
that we had suffered before, and were
shamefully entreated, as ye know, at
Philippi, we were bold in our God to
speak unto you the gospel of God with
much contention" (ii. 21).</P>

Jews who believed not set all the city
in an uproar, and assaulted the house of
Jason where Paul and Silas were, and
sought to bring them out to the people."
Acts xvii. 5. The epistle declares, "when
we were with you, we told you before
that we should suffer tribulation; even
<HI>as it came to pass, and ye know</HI>" (iii. 4).</P>
<P>The history brings Paul and Silas and
Timothy together at Corinth, soon after the
preaching of the gospel at Thessalonica:
"And when Silas and Timotheus were come
from Macedonia (to Corinth), Paul was
pressed in spirit." Acts xviii. 5. The
epistle is written in the name of these
three persons, who consequently must have
been together at the time, and speaks
throughout of their ministry at Thessa∣lonica
as a recent transaction: "We, bre∣thren,
<HI>being taken from you for a short
time,</HI> in presence not in heart, endeavour∣ed
the more abundantly to see your face
with great desire" (ii. 17).</P>
<P>The harmony is indubitable; but the
points of history in which it consists, are
so expressly set sorth in the narrative, and
<PB N="299" REF="301"/>
so directly referred to in the epistle, that it
becomes necessary for us to shew, that the
facts in one writing were not copied from
the other. Now amidst some minuter dis∣crepancies,
which will be noticed below,
there is one circumstance which mixes it∣self
with all the allusions in the epistle, but
does not appear in the history any where;
and that is of a visit which St. Paul had in∣tended
to pay to the Thessalonians during
the time of his residing at Corinth: "Where∣fore
we would have come unto you
(even I Paul) once and again, but Satan
hindered us" (ii. 18). "Night and
day praying exceedingly that we might
see your face, and might perfect that
which is lacking in your faith. Now
God himself and our Father, and our
Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto
you" (iii. 10, 11). Concerning a de∣sign
which was not executed, although the
person himself, who was conscious of his
own purpose, should make mention in his
letters, nothing is more probable than that
his historian should be silent, if not igno∣rant.
The author of the epistle could not
<PB N="300" REF="302"/>
however have learnt this circumstance from
the history, for it is not there to be met
with; nor, if the historian had drawn his
materials from the epistle, is it likely that he
would have passed over a circumstance,
which is amongst the most obvious and pro∣minent
of the facts to be collected from that
source of information.</P>

<P>Chap. iii. 1-7. "Wherefore when we
could no longer forbear, we thought it
good <HI>to be left at Athens alone,</HI> and sent
Timotheus, our brother and minister of
God, to establish you, and to comfort you
concerning your faith:—but now when
Timotheus came from you unto us, and
brought us good tidings of your faith and
charity, we were comforted over you in
all our affliction and distress by your
faith."</P>
<P>The history relates, that when Paul came
out of Macedonia to Athens, Silas and Ti∣mothy
staid behind at Beraea: "The bre∣thren
sent away Paul to go as it were to
<PB N="301" REF="303"/>
the sea; but Silas and Timotheus abode
there still: and they that conducted Paul
brought him to Athens," Acts, ch. xvii.
ver. 14, 15. The history farther relates, that
after Paul had tarried some time at Athens,
and had proceeded from thence to Corinth,
whilst he was exercising his ministry in that
city, Silas and Timothy came to him from
Macedonia, Acts, ch. xviii. ver. 5. But to
reconcile the history with the clause in the
epistle which makes St. Paul say, "I thought
it good to be left at Athens alone, and to
send Timothy unto you," it is necessary
to suppose that Timothy had come up with
St. Paul at Athens; a circumstance which
the history does not mention. I remark
therefore, that, although the history do not
expressly notice this arrival, yet it contains
intimations which render it extremely pro∣bable
that the fact took place. First, as
soon as Paul had reached Athens, he sent a
message back to Silas and Timothy "for
to come to him with all speed." Acts,
chap. xvii. ver. 15. Secondly, his stay at
Athens was on purpose that they might join
him there: "Now whilst Paul <HI>waited for</HI>
<PB N="302" REF="304"/><HI>them at Athens,</HI> his spirit was stirred in
him" Acts, ch. xvii. ver. 16. Thirdly,
his departure from Athens does not appear
to have been in any sort hastened or abrupt.
It is said, "after these things," viz. his dis∣putation
with the Jews, his conferences
with the philosophers, his discourse at Are∣opagus,
and the gaining of some converts,
"he departed from Athens and came to
Corinth." It is not hinted that he quitted
Athens before the time that he had intended
to leave it; it is not suggested that he
was driven from thence, as he was from
many cities, by tumults or persecutions,
or because his life was no longer safe.
Observe then the particulars which the his∣tory
<HI>does</HI> notice—that Paul had ordered Ti∣mothy
to follow him without delay, that
he waited at Athens on purpose that Ti∣mothy
might come up with him, that he
staid there as long as his own choice led
him to continue. Laying these circum∣stances
which the history does disclose to∣gether,
it is highly probable that Timothy
came to the apostle at Athens, a fact which
the epistle, we have seen, virtually asserts,
<PB N="303" REF="305"/>
when it makes Paul send Timothy back
from Athens to Thessalonica. The <HI>sending
back of Timothy into Macedonia</HI> accounts
also for his not coming to Corinth till after
Paul had been fixed in that city for some
considerable time. Paul had found out
Aquila and Priscilla, abode with them and
wrought, being of the same craft; and rea∣soned
in the synagogue every sabbath-day,
and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.
Acts, ch. xviii. ver. 1-5. All this passed
at Corinth before Silas and Timotheus were
come from Macedonia. Acts, ch. xviii. ver. 5.
If this was the first time of their coming up
with him after their separation at Beraea,
there is nothing to account for a delay so
contrary to what appears from the history
itself to have been St. Paul's plan and ex∣pectation.
This is a conformity of a pe∣culiar
species. The epistle discloses a fact
which is not preserved in the history; but
which makes what is said in the history
more significant, probable, and consistent.
The history bears marks of an omission;
the epistle by reference furnishes a circum∣stance
which supplies that omission.</P>

<P>Chap. ii. ver. 14. "For ye, brethren, be∣came
followers of the churches of God
which in Judea are in Christ Jesus; for ye
also have suffered like things <HI>of your own
countrymen,</HI> even as they have of the
Jews."</P>
<P>To a reader of the Acts of the Apostles,
it might seem, at first sight, that the perse∣cutions
which the preachers and converts
of Christianity underwent, were suffered at
the hands of their old adversaries the Jews.
But, if we attend carefully to the accounts
there delivered, we shall observe, that,
though the opposition made to the gospel
usually <HI>originated</HI> from the enmity of the
Jews, yet in almost all places the Jews
went about to accomplish their purpose, by
stirring up the Gentile inhabitants against
their converted countrymen. Out of Ju∣dea
they had not power to do much mis∣chief
in any other way. This was the case
at Thessalonica in particular: "The Jews
which believed not, moved with envy, set
all the city in an uproar." Acts, ch. xvii.
<PB N="305" REF="307"/>
ver. 5. It was the same a short time after∣wards
at Beraea: "When the Jews of
Thessalonica had knowledge that the
word of God was preached of Paul at Be∣raea,
they came thither also, and stirred
up the people." Acts, ch. xvii. ver. 13.
And before this our apostle had met with a
like species of persecution, in his progress
through the lesser Asia: "In every city the
unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles,
and made their minds evil affected against
the brethren." Acts, ch. xiv. ver. 2. The
epistle therefore represents the case accu∣rately
as the history states it. It was the
Jews always who set on foot the persecu∣tions
against the apostles and their follow∣ers.
He speaks truly therefore of them,
when he says in this epistle, "they both
killed the Lord Jesus and their own pro∣phets,
and have <HI>persecuted us</HI>—forbidding
us to speak unto the Gentiles" (ii. 15,
16). But out of Judea it was at the hands
of the Gentiles, it was "of their own coun∣trymen,"
that the injuries they under∣went
were immediately sustained: "Ye have
<PB N="306" REF="308"/>
suffered like things of your own country∣men,
even as they have of the Jews."</P>

<P>The apparent discrepancies between our
epistle and the history, though of magnitude
sufficient to repel the imputation of con∣federacy
or transcription (in which view
they form a part of our argument), are nei∣ther
numerous, nor very difficult to recon∣cile.</P>
<P>One of these may be observed in the
ninth and tenth verses of the second chapter:
"For ye remember, brethren, our labour
and travel; for labouring night and day,
because we would not be chargeable unto
any of you, we preached unto you the
gospel of God. Ye are witnesses and
God also, how holily and justly and un∣blameably
we behaved ourselves among
you that believe." A person who reads
this passage is naturally led by it to sup∣pose,
that the writer had dwelt at Thessa∣lonica
for some considerable time; yet of
St. Paul's ministry in that city, the history
<PB N="307" REF="309"/>
gives no other account than the following:
"that he came to Thessalonica, where was
a synagogue of the Jews; that, as his
manner was, he went in unto them, and
<HI>three sabbath-days</HI> reasoned with them out
of the scriptures; that some of them be∣lieved
and consorted with Paul and Silas."
The history then proceeds to tell us, that
the Jews which believed not set the city in
an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason,
where Paul and his companions lodged;
that the consequence of this outrage was,
that "the brethren immediately sent away
Paul and Silas by night unto Beraea."
Acts, ch. xvii. ver. 1-10. From the men∣tion
of his preaching three sabbath-days in
the Jewish synagogue, and from the want
of any farther specification of his ministry,
it has usually been taken for granted that
Paul did not continue at Thessalonica more
than three weeks. This, however, is in∣ferred
without necessity. It appears to have
been St. Paul's practice, in almost every
place that he came to, upon his first arrival
to repair to the synagogue. He thought
<PB N="308" REF="310"/>
himself bound to propose the gospel to the
Jews <HI>first,</HI> agreeably to what he declared
at Antioch in Pisidia; "it was necessary
that the word of God should first have
been spoken to you." Acts, ch. xiii.
ver. 46. If the Jews rejected his ministry,
he quitted the synagogue, and betook him∣self
to a Gentile audience. At Corinth, upon
his first coming thither, he reasoned in the
synagogue every sabbath; "but when the
Jews opposed themselves, and blasphemed,
he departed thence," expressly telling
them, "from henceforth I will go unto the
Gentiles; and he remained in that city a
year and six months." Acts, ch. xviii.
ver. 6-11. At Ephesus, in like manner,
for the space of three months he went into
the synagogue; but, "when divers were
hardened and believed not, but spake evil
of that way, he departed from them and
separated the disciples, disputing daily in
the school of one Tyrannus; and this
continued by the space of two years."
Acts, ch. xix. ver. 9, 10. Upon inspecting
the history, I see nothing in it which nega∣tives
<PB N="309" REF="311"/>
the supposition, that St. Paul pursued
the same plan at Thessalonica which he
adopted in other places; and that, though
he resorted to the synagogue only three sab∣bath-days,
yet he remained in the city, and
in the exercise of his ministry amongst the
Gentile citizens, much longer; and until the
success of his preaching had provoked the
Jews to excite the tumult and insurrection
by which he was driven away.</P>
<P>Another seeming discrepancy is found in
the ninth verse of the first chapter of the
epistle: "For they themselves show of us
what manner of entering in we had unto
you, and how <HI>ye turned to God from idols</HI>
to serve the living and true God." This
text contains an assertion, that, by means of
St. Paul's ministry at Thessalonica, many
idolatrous Gentiles had been brought over to
Christianity. Yet the history, in describing
the effects of that ministry, only says, that
"some of the Jews believed, and of the de∣vout
Greeks a great multitude, and of the
chief women not a few" (ch. xvii. ver. 4).
The devout Greeks were those who already
<PB N="310" REF="312"/>
worshipped the one true God; and there∣fore
could not be said, by embracing Christi∣anity,
"to be turned to God from idols."</P>
<P>This is the difficulty. The answer may
be assisted by the following observations.
The Alexandrian and Cambridge manu∣scripts
read (for <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>). In which reading they are also
confirmed by the Vulgate Latin. And this
reading is in my opinion strongly supported
by the considerations, first, that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
alone, <HI>i. e.</HI> without <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, is used in this
sense in this same chapter, Paul being come
to Athens, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: secondly, that
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> no where come together.
The expression is redundant. The <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
must be <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Thirdly, that the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
is much more likely to have been left out
incuriâ manus than to have been put in.
Or, after all, if we be not allowed to change
the present reading, which is undoubtedly
retained by a great plurality of copies, may
not the passage in the history be considered
<PB N="311" REF="313"/>
as describing only the effects of St. Paul's
discourses during the three sabbath-days in
which he preached in the synagogue? and
may it not be true, as we have remarked
above, that his application to the Gentiles at
large, and his success amongst them, was
posterior to this?</P>

<HEAD>THE SECOND EPISTLE TO THE
THESSALONIANS.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>No. I.</HEAD>
<P>IT may seem odd to alledge obscurity it∣self
as an argument, or to draw a proof
in favour of a writing, from that which is
usually considered as the principal defect in
its composition. The present epistle, how∣ever,
furnishes a passage, hitherto unex∣plained,
and probably inexplicable by us,
the existence of which, under the darkness
and difficulties that attend it, can only be
accounted for upon the supposition of the
epistle being genuine; and upon that sup∣position
is accounted for with great ease.
The passage which I allude to is found in
the second chapter: "that day shall not
come, except there come a falling away
first, and that man of sin be revealed, the
son of perdition, who opposeth and ex∣alteth
himself above all that is called God,
<PB N="313" REF="315"/>
or that is worshipped; so that he as God
sitteth in the temple of God, shewing
himself that he is God. Remember ye not,
that WHEN I WAS YET WITH YOU I TOLD
YOU THESE THINGS? <HI>And now ye know
what withholdeth, that he might be revealed
in his time</HI>; for the mystery of iniquity doth
already work, <HI>only he that now letteth will
let, until he be taken out of the way</HI>; and
then shall that wicked be revealed, whom
the Lord shall consume with the spirit of
his mouth, and shall destroy with the
brightness of his coming." It were su∣perfluous
to prove, because it is in vain to
deny, that this passage is involved in great
obscurity, more especially the clauses distin∣guished
by Italics. Now the observation I
have to offer is founded upon this, that the
passage expressly refers to a conversation
which the author had previously holden
with the Thessalonians upon the same sub∣ject:
"Remember ye not, that when I was
yet with you <HI>I told you these things? And
now ye know</HI> what withholdeth." If such
conversation actually passed; if, whilst he
was yet with them, "he <HI>told</HI> them those
<PB N="314" REF="316"/>
things," then it follows that the epistle is
authentic. And of the reality of this con∣versation
it appears to be a proof, that what
is said in the epistle might be understood by
those who had been present to such conver∣sation,
and yet be incapable of being ex∣plained
by any other. No man writes un∣intelligibly
on purpose. But it may easily
happen, that a part of a letter which relates
to a subject, upon which the parties had
conversed together before, which refers to
what had been before <HI>said,</HI> which is in
truth a portion or continuation of a for∣mer
discourse, may be utterly without
meaning to a stranger, who should pick up
the letter upon the road, and yet be per∣fectly
clear to the person to whom it is di∣rected,
and with whom the previous com∣munication
had passed. And if, in a letter
which thus accidentally fell into my hands,
I found a passage expressly referring to a
former conversation, and difficult to be ex∣plained
without knowing that conversation,
I should consider this very difficulty as a
proof that the conversation had actually
passed, and consequently that the letter con∣tained
<PB N="315" REF="317"/>
the real correspondence of real per∣sons.</P>

<P>Chap. iii. ver. 8. "Neither did we eat any
man's bread for nought, but wrought with
labour night and day, that we might not
be-chargeable to any of you: not because
we have not power, but to make ourselves
an ensample unto you to follow."</P>
<P>In a letter, purporting to have been writ∣ten
to another of the Macedonic churches,
we find the following declaration:</P>
<P>"Now ye, Philippians, know also that in
the beginning of the gospel, when I de∣parted
from Macedonia, <HI>no church commu∣nicated
with me as concerning giving and
receiving, but ye only.</HI>"</P>
<P>The conformity between these two pas∣sages
is strong and plain. They confine the
transaction to the same period. The epistle
to the Philippians refers to what passed "in
the beginning of the gospel," that is to say,
during the first preaching of the gospel on
that side of the Aegean sea. The epistle to
the Thessalonians speaks of the apostle's con∣duct
<PB N="316" REF="318"/>
in that city upon "his first entrance in
unto them," which the history informs us
was in the course of his first visit to the pen∣insula
of Greece.</P>
<P>As St. Paul tells the Philippians, "that
no church communicated with him, as
concerning giving and receiving, but they
only," he could not, consistently with the
truth of this declaration, have received any
thing from the neighbouring church of
Thessalonica. What thus appears by ge∣neral
implication in an epistle to another
church, when he writes to the Thessalonians
themselves, is noticed expressly and parti∣cularly:
"neither did we eat any man's
bread for nought, but wrought night and
day, that we might not be chargeable to
any of you."</P>
<P>The texts here cited farther also exhibit
a mark of conformity with what St. Paul is
made to say of himself in the Acts of the
Apostles. The apostle not only reminds
the Thessalonians that he had not been
chargeable to any of them, but he states
likewise the motive which dictated this re∣serve;
"not because we have not power, but
<PB N="317" REF="319"/>
to make ourselves an ensample unto you
to follow us" (chap. iii. ver. 9). This con∣duct,
and what is much more precise, the
end which he had in view by it, was the
very same as that which the history attri∣butes
to St. Paul in a discourse, whichit re∣presents
him to have addressed to the elders
of the church of Ephesus: "Yea, ye your∣selves
also know that these hands have
ministered unto my necessities, and to them
that were with me. I have <HI>showed</HI> you
all things, how <HI>that so labouring ye ought
to support the weak.</HI>" Acts, ch. xx. ver. 34.
The sentiment in the epistle and in the
speech is in both parts of it so much alike,
and yet the words which convey it show so
little of imitation or even of resemblance,
that the agreement cannot well be explained
without supposing the speech and the letter
to have really procceded from the same
person.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>No. III.</HEAD>
<P>Our reader remembers the passage in the
first epistle to the Thessalonians, in which
St. Paul spoke of the coming of Christ:
<PB N="318" REF="320"/>
"This we say unto you by the word of the
Lord, that we which are alive, and remain
unto the coming of the Lord, shall not
prevent them which are asleep; for the
Lord himself shall descend from heaven,
and the dead in Christ shall rise first; then
we which are alive and remain, shall be
caught up together with them in the
clouds, and so shall we be ever with the
Lord.—But ye, brethren, are not in dark∣ness,
that that day should overtake you as a
thief." 1 Thess. iv. 15-17. and ch. v. ver.
4. It should seem that the Thessalonians, or
some however amongst them, had from this
passage conceived an opinion (and that not
very unnaturally) that the coming of Christ
was to take place instantly, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, nempe hoc anno, says Grotius, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> hic dicitur de re praesenti, ut Rom. viii. 38. 1 Cor. iii. 22. Gal. i. 4. Heb. ix. 9.</NOTE>;
and that this persuasion had produced, as it
well might, much agitation in the church.
The apostle therefore now writes, amongst
other purposes, to quiet this alarm, and to
rectify the misconstruction that had been
<PB N="319" REF="321"/>
put upon his words: "Now we beseech you,
brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus
Christ, and by our gathering together unto
him, that ye be not soon shaken in mind,
or be troubled, neither by spirit nor by
word, <HI>nor by letter, as from us,</HI> as that the
day of Christ is at hand." If the allusion
which we contend for be admitted, namely,
if it be admitted, that the passage in the
second epistle relates to the passage in the
first, it amounts to a considerable proof of
the genuineness of both epistles. I have no
conception, because I know no example, of
such a device in a forgery, as first to frame
an ambiguous passage in a letter, then to
represent the persons to whom the letter is
addressed as mistaking the meaning of the
passage, and lastly to write a second letter
in order to correct this mistake.</P>
<P>I have said that this argument arises out
of the text, <HI>if</HI> the allusion be admitted; for I
am not ignorant that many expositors un∣derstand
the passage in the second epistle, as
referring to some forged letters, which had
been produced in St. Paul's name, and in
which the apostle had been made to say that
<PB N="320" REF="322"/>
the coming of Christ was then at hand. In
defence, however, of the explanation which
we propose the reader is desired to observe,</P>
<P N="1">1. The strong fact, that there exists a
passage in the first epistle, to which that in
the second is capable of being referred, <HI>i. e.</HI>
which accounts for the error the writer is
solicitous to remove. Had no other epistle
than the second been extant, and had it un∣der
these circumstances come to be consi∣dered,
whether the text before us related to
a forged epistle or to some misconstruction
of a true one, many conjectures and many
probabilities might have been admitted in
the enquiry, which can have little weight,
when an epistle is produced, containing the
very sort of passage we were seeking, that
is, a passage liable to the misinterpretation
which the apostle protests against.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the clause which introduces the
passage in the second epistle bears a particu∣lar
affinity to what is found in the passage
cited from the first epistle. The clause is
this: "We beseech you, brethren, by the
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and <HI>by
our gathering together unto him.</HI>" Now in
<PB N="321" REF="323"/>
the first epistle the description of the com∣ing
of Christ is accompanied with the men∣tion
of this very circumstance of his saints
"being collected round him." "The Lord
himself shall descend from heaven with a
shout, with the voice of the archangel,
and with the trump of God, and the dead
in Christ shall rise first; then we which
are alive and remain shall be caught up
together with them in the clouds, <HI>to meet
the Lord</HI> in the air." 1 Thess. chap. iv.
ver. 16, 17. This I suppose to be the "ga∣thering
together unto him" intended in
the second epistle; and that the author,
when he used these words, retained in his
thoughts what he had written on the sub∣ject
before.</P>
<P N="3">3. The second epistle is written in the
joint name of Paul, Sylvanus, and Timo∣theus,
and it cautions the Thessalonians
against being misled "by letter as from us"
(<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>). Do not these words '<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>'
appropriate the reference to some writing
which bore the name of these three teach∣ers?
Now this circumstance, which is a
very close one, belongs to the epistle at pre∣sent
<PB N="322" REF="324"/>
in our hands; for the epistle which we
call the first epistle to the Thessalonians
contains these names in its superscription.</P>
<P N="4">4. The words in the original, as far as
they are material to be stated, are these: "<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.
Under the weight of the
preceding observations may not the words
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
be construed to signify quasi nos quid tale aut
dixerimus aut scripserimus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Should a contrary interpretation be preferred, I do not think that it implies the conclusion that a false epis∣tle had then been published in the apostle's name. It will completely satisfy the allusion in the text to allow, that some one or other at Thessalonica had pretended to have been told by St. Paul and his companions, or to have seen a letter from them in which they had said, that the day of Christ was at hand. In like manner as Acts xv. 1, 24, it is recorded that some had pretended to have received instructions from the church of Jerusa∣lem, which had not been received "to whom they gave no such commandment." And thus Dr. Benson in∣terpreted the passage <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, "nor be dismayed by any revelation, or discourse, or epistle, which any one shall pretend to have heard or received from us."</NOTE>, intimating that
their words had been mistaken, and that

<HEAD>THE FIRST EPISTLE TO TIMOTHY.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the third verse of the first chap∣ter,
"as I besought thee to abide still
at Ephesus when I went into Macedonia,"
it is evident that this epistle was written
soon after St. Paul had gone to Macedonia
from Ephesus. Dr. Benson fixes its date
to the time of St. Paul's journey, recorded
in the beginning of the twentieth chapter of
the Acts: "And after the uproar (excited by
Demetrius at Ephesus) was ceased, Paul
called unto him the disciples, and em∣braced
them, and departed for to go into
Macedonia." And in this opinion Dr.
Benson is followed by Michaelis, as he was
<PB N="324" REF="326"/>
preceded by the greater part of the com∣mentators
who have considered the ques∣tion.
There is however one objection to
the hypothesis which these learned men ap∣pear
to me to have overlooked; and it is
no other than this, that the superscription
of the second epistle to the Corinthians
seems to prove, that at the time St. Paul is
supposed by them to have written this epis∣tle
to Timothy, Timothy in truth was with
St. Paul in Macedonia. Paul, as it is re∣lated
in the Acts, left Ephesus "for to go
into Macedonia." When he had got into
Macedonia he wrote his second epistle to
the Corinthians. Concerning this point
there exists little variety of opinion. It is
plainly indicated by the contents of the
epistle. It is also strongly implied that the
epistle was written <HI>soon</HI> after the apostle's
arrival in Macedonia; for he begins his let∣ter
by a train of reflection, referring to his
persecutions in Asia as to recent transac∣tions,
as to dangers from which he had
lately been delivered. But in the salutation
with which the epistle opens <HI>Timothy is joined
with St. Paul,</HI> and consequently could not
<PB N="325" REF="327"/>
at that time be "left behind at Ephesus."
And as to the only solution of the difficulty
which can be thought of, viz. that Timo∣thy,
though he was left behind at Ephesus
upon St. Paul's departure from Asia, yet
might follow him so soon after, as to come
up with the apostle in Macedonia, before he
wrote his epistle to the Corinthians; that
supposition is inconsistent with the terms
and tenor of the epistle throughout. For
the writer speaks uniformly of his intention
to return to Timothy at Ephesus, and not of
his expecting Timothy to come to him in
Macedonia: "These things write I unto
thee, <HI>hoping to come unto thee shortly</HI>; but if
I tarry long that thou mayest know how
thou oughtest to behave thyself" (chap. iii.
ver. 14, 15). "<HI>Till I come</HI> give attendance
to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine"
(chap. iv. ver. 13).</P>
<P>Since, therefore, the leaving of Timothy
behind at Ephesus, when Paul went into
Macedonia, suits not with any journey into
Macedonia recorded in the Acts, I concur
with Bishop Pearson in placing the date of
this epistle, and the journey referred to in
<PB N="326" REF="328"/>
it, at a period subsequent to St. Paul's first
imprisonment at Rome, and consequently
subsequent to the aera, up to which the Acts
of the Apostles brings his history. The only
difficulty which attends our opinion is, that
St. Paul must, according to us, have come
to Ephesus after his liberation at Rome,
contrary as it should seem to what he fore∣told
to the Ephesian elders, "that they
should see his face no more." And it is
to save the infallibility of this prediction,
and for no other reason of weight, that an
earlier date is assigned to this epistle. The
prediction itself however, when considered
in connection with the circumstances under
which it was delivered, does not seem to
demand so much anxiety. The words in
question are found in the twenty-fifth verse
of the twentieth chapter of the Acts: "And
now behold, I know that ye all, among
whom I have gone preaching the king∣dom
of God, shall see my face no more."
In the twenty-second and twenty-third
verses of the same chapter, i. e. two verses
before, the apostle makes this declaration:
"And now behold, I go bound in the spirit
<PB N="327" REF="329"/>
unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things
that shall befal me there; save that the
Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, say∣ing,
that bonds and afflictions abide me."
This "witnessing of the Holy Ghost" was
undoubtedly prophetic and supernatural.
But it went no farther than to foretel that
bonds and afflictions awaited him. And I
can very well conceive, that this might be
all which was communicated to the apostle
by extraordinary revelation, and that the
rest was the conclusion of his own mind,
the desponding inference which he drew
from strong and repeated intimations of
approaching danger. And the expression
"I know," which St. Paul here uses, does
not perhaps, when applied to future events
affecting himself, convey an assertion so po∣sitive
and absolute as we may at first sight
apprehend. In the first chapter of the epis∣tle
to the Philippians and the twenty-fifth
verse, "I know," says he, "that I shall
abide and continue with you all for your
joy and furtherance of faith." Notwith∣standing
this strong declaration, in the se∣cond
chapter and twenty-third verse of this
<PB N="328" REF="330"/>
same epistle, and speaking also of the very
same event, he is content to use a language
of some doubt and uncertainty: "Him there∣fore
I hope to send presently, so soon <HI>as I
shall see how it will go with me</HI>; but <HI>I trust</HI>
in the Lord that I also myself shall come
shortly." And a few verses preceding
these, he not only seems to doubt of his
safety, but almost to despair; to contem∣plate
the possibility at least of his condem∣nation
and martyrdom: "Yea, and if I be
offered upon the sacrifice and service of
your faith, I joy and rejoice with you
all."</P>

<P>But can we show that St. Paul visited
Ephesus after his liberation at Rome? or
rather, can we collect any hints from his
other letters which make it probable that
he did? If we can, then we have a <HI>coinci∣dence.</HI>
If we cannot, we have only an unau∣thorized
supposition, to which the exigency
of the case compels us to resort. Now, for
this purpose, let us examine the epistle to
the Philippians and the epistle to Philemon.
<PB N="329" REF="331"/>
These two epistles purport to be written
whilst St. Paul was yet a prisoner at Rome.
To the Philippians he writes as follows:
"I trust in the Lord that I also myself
shall come shortly." To Philemon, who
was a Colossian, he gives this direction:
"But withal, prepare me also a lodging,
for I trust that through your prayers I
shall be given unto you." An inspection
of the map will show us that Colosse was a
city of the Lesser Asia, lying eastward, and
at no great distance from Ephesus. Philippi
was on the other, i. e. the western side of
the Aegean sea. If the apostle executed his
purpose; if, in pursuance of the intention
expressed in his letter to Philemon, he came
to Colosse soon after he was set at liberty at
Rome, it is very improbable that he would
omit to visit Ephesus, which lay so near to
it, and where he had spent three years of
his ministry. As he was also under a pro∣mise
to the church of Philippi to see them
"shortly;" if he passed from Colosse to
Philippi, or from Philippi to Colosse, he
could hardly avoid taking Ephesus in his
way.</P>

<P>Chap. v. ver. 9. "Let not a widow be
taken into the number under threescore
years old."</P>
<P>This accords with the account delivered
in the sixth chapter of the Acts: "And in
those days, when the number of the dis∣ciples
was multiplied, there arose a mur∣muring
of the Grecians against the He∣brews,
<HI>because their widows were neglected
in the daily ministration.</HI>" It appears that,
from the first formation of the Christian
church, provision was made out of the pub∣lic
funds of the society for the indigent <HI>wi∣dows</HI>
who belonged to it. The history, we
have seen, distinctly records the existence of
such an institution at Jerusalem, a few
years after our Lord's ascension; and is led
to the mention of it very incidentally, viz.
by a dispute, of which it was the occasion,
and which produced important conse∣quences
to the Christian community. The
epistle, without being suspected of borrow∣ing
from the history, refers, briefly indeed,
<PB N="331" REF="333"/>
but decisively, to a similar establishment,
subsisting some years afterwards at Ephesus.
This agreement indicates that both writings
were founded upon real circumstances.</P>
<P>But, in this article, the material thing
to be noticed is the mode of expression:
"Let not a widow be taken into the num∣ber."
No previous account or explana∣tion
is given, to which these words, "into
the number," can refer; but the direction
comes concisely and unpreparedly: "Let
not a widow be taken into the number."
Now this is the way in which a man writes,
who is conscious that he is writing to per∣sons
already acquainted with the subject of
his letter; and who, he knows, will readily
apprehend and apply what he says by vir∣tue
of their being so acquainted: but it is
not the way in which a man writes upon
any other occasion; and least of all, in
which a man would draw up a feigned let∣ter,
or introduce a suppositious fact<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is not altogether unconnected with our general purpose to remark, in the passage before us, the selec∣tion and reserve which St. Paul recommends to the go∣vernors of the church of Ephesus, in the bestowing re∣lief upon the poor, because it refutes a calumny which has been insinuated, that the liberality of the first Christians was an artifice to catch converts; or one of the temptations however, by which the idle and mendi∣cant were drawn into this society: "Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man, well reported of for her good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work: but the younger widows refuse" (v. 9. 10, 11). And, in another place, "If any man or woman that believeth have wi∣dows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged, that it may relieve them that are widows indeed." And to the same effect, or rather more to our present purpose, the apostle writes in his second epistle to the Thessalonians: "Even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither let him eat," i. e. at the public expence; "for we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly <HI>working not at all,</HI> but are busy∣bodies: now them that are such, we command and ex∣hort, by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread." Could a de∣signing or dissolute poor take advantage of bounty regu∣lated with so much caution? or could the mind which dictated these sober and prudent directions be influ∣enced in his recommendations of public charity by any other than the properest motives of beneficence?</NOTE>.</P>

I single out from the collection as evincing

no man would have made the subject of

the church. It agreed with the infancy of
the society, and with no other state of it.
After the government of the church had
acquired the dignified form which it soon

have no place. Would a person who lived

to prescribe concerning the qualification

<P>Chap. v. ver. 23. "Drink no longer
water, but use a little wine for thy sto∣mach's
sake, and thine often infirmities."</P>
<P>Imagine an impostor sitting down to
forge an epistle in the name of St. Paul. Is
it credible that it should come into his head
to give such a direction as this; so remote
from every thing of doctrine or discipline,
every thing of public concern to the reli∣gion
or the church, or to any sect, order, or
party in it, and from every purpose with
which such an epistle could be written? It
seems to me that nothing but reality, that
is, the real valetudinary situation of a real
<PB N="335" REF="337"/>
person, could have suggested a thought of
so domestic a nature.</P>
<P>But if the peculiarity of the advice be
observable, the place in which it stands is
more so. The context is this: "Lay hands
suddenly on no man, neither be partaker
of other men's sins; keep thyself pure;
drink no longer water, but use a little
wine for thy stomach's sake, and thine
often infirmities: some men's sins are
open before hand, going before to judg∣ment;
and some men they follow after."
The direction to Timothy about his diet
stands between two sentences, as wide from
the subject as possible. The train of thought
seems to be broken to let it in. Now
when does this happen? It happens when
a man writes as he remembers; when he
puts down an article that occurs the mo∣ment
it occurs, lest he should afterwards
forget it. Of this the passage before us
bears strongly the appearance. In actual
letters, in the negligence of a real corre∣spondence,
examples of this kind frequently
take place; seldom I believe in any other
production. For the moment a man re∣gards
<PB N="336" REF="338"/>
what he writes as a <HI>composition,</HI> which
the author of a forgery would, of all others,

<P>Chap. i. ver. 15, 16. "This is a faithful
saying, and worthy of all acceptation,
that Christ Jesus came into the world to
save sinners, of whom I am chief. How∣beit,
for this cause I obtained mercy, that
in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth
all long-suffering, for a pattern to them
which should hereafter believe in him to
life everlasting."</P>
<P>What was the mercy which St. Paul
here commemorates, and what was the
crime of which he accuses himself, is ap∣parent
from the verses immediately preced∣ing:
"I thank Christ Jesus, our Lord, who
hath enabled me, for that he counted me
faithful, putting me into the ministry,
<HI>who was before a blasphemer, and a perse∣cutor</HI><PB N="337" REF="339"/>
<HI>and injurious</HI>; but I obtained <HI>mercy,</HI>
because I did it ignorantly in unbelief"
(ch. i. ver. 12, 13). The whole quotation
plainly refers to St. Paul's original enmity to
the Christian name, the interposition of provi∣dence
in his conversion, and his subsequent
designation to the ministry of the gospel;
and by this reference assirms indeed the
substance of the apostle's history delivered
in the Acts. But what in the passage
strikes my mind most powerfully, is the
observation that is raised out of the fact:
"For this cause I obtained mercy, that in
me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all
long-suffering, for a pattern to them
which should hereafter believe on him
to life everlasting." It is a just and so∣lemn
reflection, springing from the circum∣stances
of the author's conversion, or rather
from the impression which that great event
had left upon his memory. It will be said,
perhaps, that an impostor, acquainted with
St. Paul's history, may have put such a sen∣timent
into his mouth; or, what is the same
thing, into a letter drawn up in his name.
But where, we may ask, is such an impos∣tor
<PB N="338" REF="340"/>
to be found? The piety, the truth, the
benevolence of the thought ought to pro∣tect
it from this imputation. For, though
we should allow that one of the great mas∣ters
of the ancient tragedy could have given
to his scene a sentiment as virtuous and as
elevated as this is, and, at the same time,
as appropriate, and as well suited to the
particular situation of the person who deli∣vers
it; yet whoever is conversant in these
enquiries will acknowledge, that to do this
in a fictitious production is beyond the
reach of the understandings which have been
employed upon any <HI>fabrications</HI> that have
come down to us under Christian names.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<HEAD>THE SECOND EPISTLE TO TIMOTHY.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>No. I.</HEAD>
<P>IT was the uniform tradition of the pri∣mitive
church, that St. Paul visited
Rome twice, and twice there suffered im∣prisonment;
and that he was put to death
at Rome at the conclusion of his second
imprisonment. This opinion concerning St.
Paul's <HI>two</HI> journeys to Rome, is confirmed
by a great variety of hints and allusions in
the epistle before us, compared with what
fell from the apostle's pen in other letters
purporting to have been written from Rome.
That our present epistle was written whilst
St. Paul was a <HI>prisoner,</HI> is distinctly intimated
by the eighth verse of the first chapter:
"Be not thou therefore ashamed of the
testimony of our Lord, nor of me his pri∣soner."
And whilst he was a prisoner <HI>at
Rome,</HI> by the sixteenth and seventeenth
<PB N="340" REF="342"/>
verses of the same chapter: "The Lord give
mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for
he oft refreshed me, and was not asham∣ed
of my chain: but when he was in
Rome he sought me out very diligently,
and found me." Since it appears from the
former quotation that St. Paul wrote this
epistle in confinement, it will hardly admit of
doubt that the word <HI>chain,</HI> in the latter
quotation, refers to that consinement; the
chain by which he was <HI>then</HI> bound, the cus∣tody
in which he was then kept. And if
the word chain designate the author's con∣finement
at the time of writing the epistle,
the next words determine it to have been
written from Rome: "He was not ashamed
of my chain; but when he was in Rome
he sought me out very diligently." Now
that it <HI>was</HI> not written during the apostle's
first imprisonment at Rome, or during the
same imprisonment in which the epistles to
the Ephesians, the Colossians, the Philip∣pians,
and Philemon, were written, may be
gathered, with considerable evidence, from
a comparison of these several epistles with
the present.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="341" REF="343"/>
I. In the former epistles the author consi∣dently
looked forward to his liberation from
confinement, and his speedy departure from
Rome. He tells the Philippians (ch. ii.
ver. 24), "I trust in the Lord that I also
myself shall come shortly." Philemon
he bids to prepare for him a lodging; "for
I trust," says he, "that through your
prayers, I shall be given unto you"
(ver. 22). In the epistle before us he
holds a language extremely different: "I
am now ready to be offered, and the time
of my departure is at hand. I have
fought a good fight; I have finished my
course; I have kept the faith: hence∣forth
there is laid up for me a crown of
righteousness, which the Lord, the righte∣ous
judge, shall give me at that day"
(ch. iv. ver. 6-8).</P>
<P N="2">II. When the former epistles were writ∣ten
from Rome, Timothy was with St.
Paul; and is joined with him in writing to
the Colossians, the Philippians, and to Phile∣mon.
The present epistle implies that he
was absent.</P>
<P N="3">III. In the former epistles Demas was
<PB N="342" REF="344"/>
with St. Paul at Rome: "Luke, the belov∣ed
physician, and Demas, greet you." In
the epistle now before us: "Demas hath
forsaken him, having loved this present
world, and is gone to Thessalonica."</P>
<P N="4">IV. In the former epistle, Mark was
with St. Paul, and joins in saluting the Co∣lossians.
In the present epistle, Timothy is
ordered to "bring him with him, for he is
profitable to me for the ministry" (ch. iv.
ver. 11).</P>
<P>The case of Timothy and of Mark might
be very well accounted for, by supposing
the present epistle to have been written <HI>be∣fore</HI>
the others; so that Timothy, who is here
exhorted "to come shortly unto him" (ch.
iv. ver. 9.) might have arrived, and that
Mark, "whom he was to bring with him"
(ch. iv. ver. 11), might have also reached
Rome in sufficient time to have been with
St. Paul when the four epistles were
written: but then such a supposition is in∣consistent
with what is said of Demas, by
which the posteriority of this to the other
epistles is strongly indicated; for in the
other epistles Demas was with St. Paul, in
<PB N="343" REF="345"/>
the present he hath "forsaken him, and is
gone to Thessalonica." The opposition
also of sentiment, with respect to the event
of the persecution, is hardly reconcileable
to the same imprisonment.</P>
<P>The two following considerations, which
were first suggested upon this question by
Ludovicus Capellus, are still more conclu∣sive.</P>
<P N="1">1. In the twentieth verse of the fourth
chapter, St. Paul informs Timothy "that
Erastus abode at Corinth,"
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. The form of expression implies,
that Erastus had staid behind at Corinth,
when St. Paul left it. But this could not
be meant of any journey from Corinth
which St. Paul took prior to his first impri∣sonment
at Rome; for when Paul departed
from Corinth, as related in the twentieth
chapter of the Acts, Timothy was with
him: and this was the last time the apostle
left Corinth before his coming to Rome;
because he left it to proceed on his way to
Jerusalem, soon after his arrival at which
place he was taken into custody, and con∣tinued
in that custody till he was carried to
<PB N="344" REF="346"/>
Caesar's tribunal. There could be no need
therefore to inform Timothy that "Erastus
staid behind at Corinth" upon this occasion,
because, if the fact was so, it must have
been known to Timothy who was present,
as well as to St. Paul.</P>
<P N="2">2. In the same verse our epistle also states
the following article: "Trophimus have I
left at Miletum sick." When St. Paul
passed through Miletum on his way to Je∣rusalem,
as related Acts xx. Trophimus was
not left behind, but accompanied him to
that city. He was indeed the occasion of
the uproar at Jerusalem, in consequence of
which St. Paul was apprehended; for "they
had seen," says the historian, "before
with him in the city, Trophimus an
Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul
had brought into the temple." This
was evidently the last time of Paul's being
at Miletus before his first imprisonment;
for, as hath been said, after his apprehen∣sion
at Jerusalem, he remained in custody
till he was sent to Rome.</P>
<P>In these two articles we have a journey
referred to, which must have taken place
<PB N="345" REF="347"/>
subsequent to the conclusion of St. Luke's
history, and of course after St. Paul's libe∣ration
from his first imprisonment. The
epistle therefore, which contains this refe∣rence,
since it appears from other parts of
it to have been written whilst St. Paul was
a prisoner at Rome, proves that he had re∣turned
to that city again, and undergone
there a second imprisonment.</P>
<P>I do not produce these particulars for the
sake of the support which they lend to the
testimony of the fathers concerning St.
Paul's <HI>second</HI> imprisonment, but to remark
their consistency and agreement with one
another. They are all resolvable into one
supposition: and although the supposition
itself be in some sort only negative, viz. that
the epistle was not written during St.
Paul's first residence at Rome, but in some
future imprisonment in that city; yet is the
consistency not less worthy of observation;
for the epistle touches upon names and
circumstances connected with the date and
with the history of the first imprisonment,
and mentioned in letters written during that
imprisonment, and so touches upon them,
<PB N="346" REF="348"/>
as to leave what is said of one consistent
with what is said of others, and consistent
also with what is said of them in different
epistles. Had one of these circumstances
been so described, as to have fixed the date
of the epistle to the first imprisonment, it
would have involved the rest in contradic∣tion.
And when the number and particu∣larity
of the articles which have been
brought together under this head are con∣sidered;
and when it is considered also, that
the comparisons we have formed amongst
them, were in all probability neither pro∣vided
for, nor thought of, by the writer of
the epistle, it will be deemed something
very like the effect of truth, that no invin∣cible
repugnancy is perceived between
them.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>No. II.</HEAD>
<P>In the Acts of the Apostles, in the six∣teenth
chapter, and at the first verse, we
are told that Paul "came to Derbe and
Lystra, and behold a certain disciple was
there named Timotheus, the son of a cer∣tain
<PB N="347" REF="349"/>
woman, which was a Jewess, and be∣lieved;
but his father was a Greek." In
the epistle before us, in the first chapter
and at the fifth verse, St. Paul writes to Timo∣thy
thus: "Greatly desiring to see thee, be∣ing
mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled
with joy, when I call to remembrance the
unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt
first in thy grandmother Lois, <HI>and thy mo∣ther
Eunice</HI>; and I am persuaded that in
thee also." Here we have a fair unforced
example of coincidence. In the history
Timothy was the "son of a Jewess <HI>that</HI>
believed:" in the epistle St. Paul ap∣plauds
"the <HI>faith</HI> which dwelt in his mother
Eunice." In the history it is said of the
mother, "that she was a Jewess, and be∣lieved;"
of the father, "that he was a
Greek." Now when it is said of the mo∣ther
<HI>alone</HI> "that shebelieved," the father
being nevertheless mentioned in the same
sentence, we are led to suppose of the father,
that he did not believe, i. e. either that he
was dead, or that he remained unconverted.
Agreeably hereunto, whilst praise is bestow∣ed
in the epistle upon one parent, and upon
<PB N="348" REF="350"/>
her sincerity in the faith, no notice is taken
of the other. The mention of the grand∣mother
is the addition of a circumstance
not found in the history: but it is a cir∣cumstance
which, as well as the names of
the parties, might naturally be expected to
be known to the apostle, though overlook∣ed
by his historian.</P>

<P>Chap. iii. ver. 15. "And that from a
child thou hast known the holy scrip∣tures,
which are able to make thee wise
unto salvation."</P>
<P>This verse discloses a circumstance which
agrees exactly with what is intimated in the
quotation from the Acts, adduced in the last
number. In that quotation it is recorded
of Timothy's mother, "that she was a Jew∣ess."
This description is virtually, "though,
I am satisfied," undesignedly, recognized in
the epistle, when Timothy is reminded in
it, "that from a child he had known the
holy scriptures." "The holy scriptures"
undoubtedly meant the scriptures of the
Old Testament. The expression bears that
<PB N="349" REF="351"/>
sense in every place in which it occurs.
Those of the New had not yet acquired the
name, not to mention, that in Timothy's
childhood, probably none of them existed.
In what manner then could Timothy have
known "from a child" the Jewish scrip∣tures,
had he not been born, on one side or
on both, of Jewish parentage? Perhaps he
was not less likely to be carefully instructed
in them, for that his mother alone professed
that religion.</P>

lusts, but follow righteousness, faith, cha∣rity,

Lord out of a pure heart."</P>
<P>"<HI>Flee also youthful lusts.</HI>" The suitable∣ness
of this precept to the age of the person
to whom it is addressed, is gathered from
1 Tim. ch. iv. ver. 12: "Let no man de∣spise
thy youth." Nor do I deem the less
of this coincidence, because the propriety
resides in a single epithet; or because this
one precept is joined with, and followed by,
a train of others, not more applicable to Ti∣mothy,
<PB N="350" REF="352"/>
than to any ordinary convert. It
is in these transient and cursory allusions
that the argument is best founded. When
a writer dwells and rests upon a point in
which some coincidence is discerned, it may
be doubted whether he himself had not fa∣bricated
the conformity, and was endea∣vouring
to display and set it off. But when
the reference is contained in a single word,
unobserved perhaps by most readers, the
writer passing on to other subjects, as un∣conscious
that he had hit upon a correspond∣ency,
or unsolicitous whether it were re∣marked
or not, we may be pretty well
assured that no fraud was exercised, no im∣position
intended.</P>

<P>Chap. iii. ver. 10, 11. "But thou hast
fully known my doctrine, manner of life,
purpose, faith, long-suffering, charity, pa∣tience,
persecutions, afflictions, which
came unto me <HI>at Antioch, at Iconium, at
Lystra</HI>; what persecutions I endured: but
out of them all the Lord delivered me."</P>
<P>The Antioch here mentioned was not
<PB N="351" REF="353"/>
Antioch the capital of Syria, where Paul and
Barnabas resided "a long time;" but An∣tioch
in Pisidia, to which place Paul and
Barnabas came in their first apostolic pro∣gress,
and where Paul delivered a memora∣ble
discourse, which is preserved in the thir∣teenth
chapter of the Acts. At this Antioch
the history relates, that "the Jews stirred
up the devout and honourable women,
and the chief men of the city, <HI>and raised
persecution against Paul and Barnabas,</HI> and
expelled them out of their coasts. But
they shook off the dust of their feet against
them, and came unto <HI>Iconium.</HI> . . . . And
it came to pass in Iconium, that they went
both together into the synagogue of the
Jews, and so spake that a great multitude
both of the Jews and also of the Greeks
believed; but the unbelieving Jews stirred
up the Gentiles, and made their minds
evil-affected against the brethren. Long
time therefore abode they speaking boldly
in the Lord, which gave testimony unto
the word of his grace, and granted signs
and wonders to be done by their hands.
But the multitude of the city was divided;
<PB N="352" REF="354"/>
and part held with the Jews, and part with
the apostles. And when there was an
assault made both of the Gentiles and also
of the Jews, with their rulers, <HI>to use them
despitefully and to stone</HI> them, they were
ware of it, and fled unto <HI>Lystra</HI> and Derbe,
cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that
lieth round about, and there they preached
the gospel . . . . And there came thither
certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium,
who persuaded the people, and having
stoned Paul, drew him out of the city,
supposing he had been dead. Howbeit,
as the disciples stood round about him, he
rose up and came into the city; and the
next day he departed with Barnabas to
Derbe: and when they had preached the
gospel in that city, and had taught many,
they returned again to Lystra, and to Ico∣nium,
and to Antioch." This account
comprises the period to which the allusion
in the epistle is to be referred. We have so
far therefore a conformity between the his∣tory
and the epistle, that St. Paul is asserted
in the history to have suffered persecutions in
the three cities, his persecutions at which
<PB N="353" REF="355"/>
are appealed to in the epistle; and not only
so, but to have suffered these persecutions
both in immediate succession, and in the
order in which the cities are mentioned in
the epistle. The conformity also extends
to another circumstance. In the apostolic
history Lystra and Derbe are commonly
mentioned together: in the quotation from
the epistle Lystra is mentioned, and not
Derbe. And the distinction will appear on
this occasion to be accurate; for St. Paul is
here enumerating his persecutions: and al∣though
he underwent grievous persecutions
in each of the three cities through which he
passed to Derbe, at Derbe itself he met with
none: "The next day he departed," says the
historian, "To Derbe; and when they had
preached the gospel to that city, and had
taught many, they returned again to Lys∣tra."
The epistle, therefore, in the names
of the cities, in the order in which they
are enumerated, and in the place at which
the enumeration stops, corresponds exactly
with the history.</P>
<P>But a second question remains, namely,
how these persecutions were "known" to
<PB N="354" REF="356"/>
Timothy, or why the apostle should recal
these in particular to his remembrance, ra∣ther
than many other persecutions with
which his ministry had been attended.
When some time, probably three years, af∣terwards
(<HI>vide</HI> Pearson's Annales Paulinas),
St. Paul made a second journey through the
same country, "in order to go again and vi∣sit
the brethren in every city where he
had preached the word of the Lord," we
read, Acts, chap. xvi. ver. 1. that, "when
he came to Derbe and Lystra, behold a
certain disciple was there named Timo∣theus."
One or other therefore of these
cities was the place of Timothy's abode. We
read moreover that he was well reported of
by the brethren that were at Lystra and
Iconium; so that he must have been well
acquainted with these places. Also again,
when Paul came to Derbe and Lystra, Ti∣mothy
was already a disciple: "Behold a
certain disciple was there named Timo∣theus."
He must, therefore, have been
converted <HI>before.</HI> But since it is expressly
stated in the epistle, that Timothy was con∣verted
by St. Paul himself, that he was "his
<PB N="355" REF="357"/>
own son in the faith;" it follows that he
must have been converted by him upon his
former journey into those parts; which was
the very time when the apostle underwent
the persecutions referred to in the epistle.
Upon the whole then, persecutions at the
several cities named in the epistle are ex∣pressly
recorded in the Acts; and Timo∣thy's
knowledge of this part of St. Paul's
history, which knowledge is appealed to in
the epistle, is fairly deduced from the place
of his abode, and the time of his conver∣sion.
It may farther be observed, that it
is probable from this account, that St. Paul
was in the midst of these persecutions when
Timothy became known to him. No won∣der
then that the apostle, though in a letter
written long afterwards, should remind his
favourite convert of those scenes of affliction
and distress under which they first met.</P>
<P>Although this coincidence, as to the
names of the cities, be more specific and di∣rect
than many which we have pointed out,
yet I apprehend there is no just reason for
thinking it to be artificial; for had the
writer of the epistle sought a coincidence
<PB N="356" REF="358"/>
with the history upon this head, and
searched the Acts of the Apostles for the
purpose, I conceive he would have sent us
at once to Philippi and Thessalonica, where
Paul suffered persecution, and where, from
what is stated, it may easily be gathered that
Timothy accompanied him, rather than
have appealed to persecutions as known to
Timothy, in the account of which persecu∣tions
Timothy's presence is not mentioned;
it not being till after one entire chapter, and
in the history of a journey three years fu∣ture
to this, that Timothy's name occurs in
the Acts of the Apostles for the first time.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD>THE EPISTLE TO TITUS.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>No. I.</HEAD>
<P>A VERY characteristic circumstance in
this epistle, is the quotation from
Epimenides, chap. i. ver. 12: "One of
themselves, even a prophet of their own,
said, the Cretians are always liars, evil
beasts, slow bellies."</P>
<Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></Q>
<P>I call this quotation characteristic, be∣cause
no writer in the New Testament, ex∣cept
St. Paul, appealed to heathen testi∣mony;
and because St. Paul repeatedly did
so. In his celebrated speech at Athens,
preserved in the seventeenth chapter of the
Acts, he tells his audience, that "in God
we live, and move, and have our being;
as certain also of your own poets have
said, for we are also his offspring."</P>
<Q>—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></Q>
<P><PB N="358" REF="360"/>
The reader will perceive much similarity
of manner in these two passages. The re∣ference
in the speech is to a heathen poet; it
is the same in the epistle. In the speech the
apostle urges his hearers with the authority
of a poet <HI>of their own</HI>; in the epistle he avails
himself of the same advantage. Yet there is
a variation, which shows that the hint of in∣serting
a quotation in the epistle was not, as
it may be suspected, borrowed from seeing
the like practice attributed to St. Paul in
the history; and it is this, that in the epistle
the author cited is called a <HI>prophet,</HI> "one of
themselves, even a <HI>prophet</HI> of their own."
Whatever might be the reason for calling
Epimenides a prophet; whether the names
of poet and prophet were occasionally con∣vertible;
whether Epimenides in particular
had obtained that title, as Grotius seems to
have proved; or whether the appellation
was given to him, in this instance, as hav∣ing
delivered a description of the Cretan
character, which the future state of morals
amongst them verified; whatever was the
reason (and any of these reasons will ac∣count
for the variation, supposing St. Paul
<PB N="359" REF="361"/>
to have been the author), one point is plain,
namely, if the epistle had been forged, and
the author had inserted a quotation in it
merely from having seen an example of the
same kind in a speech ascribed to St. Paul,
he would so far have imitated his original,
as to have introduced his quotation in the
same manner, that is, he would have given
to Epimenides the title which he saw there
given to Aratus. The other side of the al∣ternative
is that the history took the hint
from the epistle. But that the author of
the Acts of the Apostles had not the epistle
to Titus before him, at least that he did not
use it as one of the documents or materials
of his narrative, is rendered nearly certain
by the observation that the name of Titus
does not once occur in his book.</P>
<P>It is well known, and was remarked by St.
Jerome, that the apothegm in the fifteenth
chapter of the Corinthians, "evil communi∣cations
corrupt good manners," is an Iam∣bic
of Menander's:
<Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></Q></P>

</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>No. II.</HEAD>
<P>There exists a visible affinity between the
epistle to Titus and the first epistle to Ti∣mothy.
Both letters were addressed to per∣sons
left by the writer to preside in their re∣spective
churches during his absence. Both
letters are principally occupied in describing
the qualifications to be sought for, in those
whom they should appoint to offices in the
church; and the ingredients of this descrip∣tion
are in both letters nearly the same.
Timothy and Titus are likewise cautioned
against the same prevailing corruptions, and,
in particular, against the same misdirection
of their cares and studies. This affinity
obtains, not only in the subject of the let∣ters,
which, from the similarity of situation
in the persons to whom they were ad∣dressed,
might be expected to be somewhat
alike, but extends, in a great variety of in∣stances,
to the phrases and expressions. The
writer accosts his two friends with the same
<PB N="361" REF="365"/>
salutation, and passes on to the business of
his letter by the same transition.</P>
<P>"Unto Timothy, <HI>my own son in the faith,</HI>
grace, mercy, and peace from God our
Father, and Jesus Christ our Lord: <HI>as I be∣sought
thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I
went into Macedonia,</HI>" &amp;c. 1 Tim. chap. i.
ver. 2, 3.</P>
<P>"To Titus, <HI>mine own son after the common
faith,</HI> grace, mercy, and peace from God
the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ our
Saviour: <HI>for this cause left I thee in Crete.</HI>"
Tit. chap. i. ver. 4, 5.</P>
<P>If Timothy was "not to <HI>give heed to
fables</HI> and endless <HI>genealogies,</HI> which mini∣ster
<HI>questions,</HI>" 1 Tim. chap. i. ver. 4; "Ti∣tus
also was to avoid foolish <HI>questions,</HI> and
<HI>genealogies,</HI> and contentions" (chap. iii. ver.
9); "and was to rebuke them sharply, <HI>not
giving heed to Jewish fables</HI>" (chap. i. ver.
14). If Timothy was to be a pattern (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>),
1 Tim. chap. iv. ver. 12; so was Titus
(chap. ii. ver. 7). If Timothy was to "let
no man despise his youth," 1 Tim. chap.
iv. ver. 12; Titus also was to "let no
man despise him" (chap. ii. ver. 15).
This verbal consent is also observable in
<PB N="362" REF="366"/>
some very peculiar expressions, which have
no relation to the particular character of
Timothy or Titus.</P>
<P>The phrase "it is a faithful saying"
(<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>), made use of to preface
some sentence upon which the writer lays
a more than ordinary stress, occurs three
times in the first epistle to Timothy, once
in the second, and once in the epistle be∣fore
us, and in no other part of St. Paul's
writings; and it is remarkable that these
three epistles were probably all written to∣wards
the conclusion of his life; and that
they are the only epistles which were writ∣ten
after his first imprisonment at Rome.</P>
<P>The same observation belongs to another
singularity of expression, and that is in the
epithet "<HI>sound</HI>" (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>), as applied to
words or doctrine. It is thus used, twice
in the first epistle to Timothy, twice in the
second, and three times in the epistle to
Titus, beside two cognate expressions
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and it is
found, in the same sense, in no other part
of the New Testament.</P>
<P>The phrase "God our Saviour" stands
<PB N="363" REF="367"/>
in nearly the same predicament. It is re∣peated
three times in the first epistle to Ti∣mothy,
as many in the epistle to Titus, and
in no other book of the New Testament oc∣curs
at all, except once in the epistle of Jude.</P>
<P>Similar terms, intermixed indeed with
others, are employed, in the two epistles,
in enumerating the qualifications required
in those, who should be advanced to sta∣tions
of authority in the church.</P>
<P>"A bishop must be blameless, <HI>the husband
of one wise,</HI> vigilant, <HI>sober,</HI> of good beha∣viour,
<HI>given to hospitality,</HI> apt to teach,
<HI>not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of
filthy lucre</HI>; but patient, not a brawler,
not covetous, one that ruleth well his
own house, having his children in sub∣jection
with all gravity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>"</NOTE>." 1 Tim. chap.
iii. ver. 2-4.</P>
<P>"If any be <HI>blameless, the husband of one
wife,</HI> having faithful children, not ac∣cused
of riot, or unruly; for a bishop must
<PB N="364" REF="368"/>
be blameless as the steward of God, not
self-willed, not soon angry, <HI>not given to
wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre, but
a lover of hospitality,</HI> a lover of good men,
sober, just, holy, temperate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>"</NOTE>." Titus, ch. i.
ver. 6-8.</P>
<P>The most natural account which can be
given of these resemblances, is to suppose
that the two epistles were written nearly at
the same time, and whilst the same ideas
and phrases dwelt in the writer's mind. Let
us enquire therefore, whether the notes of
time, extant in the two epistles, in any man∣ner
favour this supposition.</P>
<P>We have seen that it was necessary to
refer the first epistle to Timothy to a date
subsequent to St. Paul's first imprisonment
at Rome, because there was no journey into
Macedonia prior to that event, which ac∣corded
with the circumstance of leaving
"Timothy behind at Ephesus." The jour∣ney
of St. Paul from Crete, alluded to in the
<PB N="365" REF="369"/>
epistle before us, and in which Titus "was
left in Crete to set in order the things
that were wanting," must, in like man∣ner,
be carried to the period which inter∣vened
between his first and second imprison∣ment.
For the history, which reaches, we
know, to the time of St. Paul's first impri∣sonment,
contains no account of his going to
Crete, except upon his voyage as a prisoner
to Rome; and that this could not be the
occasion referred to in our epistle is evident
from hence, that when St. Paul wrote this
epistle, he appears to have been at liberty;
whereas, after that voyage, he continued
for two years at least in confinement. Again,
it is agreed that St. Paul wrote his first epi∣stle
to Timothy from Macedonia: "As I
besought thee to abide still at Ephesus,
when I went (or came) into Macedonia."
And that he was in these parts, <HI>i. e.</HI> in this
peninsula, when he wrote the epistle to Ti∣tus,
is rendered probable by his directing
Titus to come to him to Nicopolis: "When
I shall send Artemas unto thee or Tychi∣cus,
be diligent (make haste) to come unto
me to Nicopolis; for I have determined
<PB N="366" REF="370"/>
there to winter." The most noted city of
that name was in Epirus, near to Actium.
And I think the form of speaking, as well
as the nature of the case, renders it probable,
that the writer was at Nicopolis, or in the
neighbourhood thereof, when he dictated
this direction to Titus.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, if we may be allowed
to suppose that St. Paul, after his liberation
at Rome, sailed into Asia, taking Crete in
his way; that from Asia, and from Ephesus,
the capital of that country, he proceeded into
Macedonia, and crossing the peninsula in his
progress, came into the neighbourhood of
Nicopolis; we have a route which falls in
with every thing. It executes the intention
expressed by the apostle of visiting Colosse
and Philippi as soon as he should be set at
liberty at Rome. It allows him to leave
"Titus at Crete," and "Timothy at Ephe∣sus,
as he went into Macedonia;" and to
write to both not long after from the penin∣sula
of Greece, and probably the neighbour∣hood
of Nicopolis: thus bringing together
the dates of these two letters, and thereby
accounting for that affinity between them,
<PB N="367" REF="371"/>
both in subject and language, which our re∣marks
have pointed out. I confess that the
journey, which we have thus traced out for
St. Paul, is, in a great measure, hypothetic;
but it should be observed, that it is a species
of consistency, which seldom belongs to
falsehood, to admit of an hypothesis, which
includes a great number of independent cir∣cumstances
without contradiction.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD>THE EPISTLE TO PHILEMON.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>No. I.</HEAD>
<P>THE singular correspondency between
this epistle and that to the Colossians
has been remarked already. An assertion in
the epistle to the Colossians, viz. that "One∣simus
was one of them," is verified by
the epistle to Philemon; and is verified, not
by any mention of Colosse, any the most
distant intimation concerning the place of
Philemon's abode, but singly by stating One∣simus
to be Philemon's servant, and by join∣ing
in the salutation Philemon with Archip∣pus;
for this Archippus, when we go back
to the epistle to the Colossians, appears to
have been an inhabitant of that city, and,
as it should seem, to have held an office of
authority in that church. The case stands
thus. Take the epistle to the Colossians alone,
and no circumstance is discoverable which
makes out the assertion, that Onesimus was
<PB N="369" REF="373"/>
"one of them." Take the epistle to Phile∣mon
alone, and nothing at all appears con∣cerning
the place to which Philemon or his
servant Onesimus belonged. For any thing
that is said in the epistle, Philemon might
have been a Thessalonian, a Philippian, or
an Ephesian, as well as a Colossian. Put the
two epistles together and the matter is clear.
The reader perceives a <HI>junction</HI> of circum∣stances,
which ascertains the conclusion at
once. Now, all that is necessary to be add∣ed
in this place is, that this correspondency
evinces the genuineness of one epistle, as
well as of the other. It is like comparing
the two parts of a cloven tally. Coin∣cidence
proves the authenticity of both.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>No. II.</HEAD>
<P>And this coincidence is perfect; not only
in the main article of showing, by implica∣tion,
Onesimus to be a Colossian, but in
many dependent circumstances.</P>
<P N="1">1. "I beseech thee for my son Onesimus,
whom <HI>I have sent</HI> again" (ver 10-12).
It appears from the epistle to the Colossians,
<PB N="370" REF="374"/>
that, in truth, Onesimus was sent at that
time to Colosse: "All my state shall Tychi∣cus
declare, whom I have sent unto you
for the same purpose, <HI>with Onesimus</HI> a faith∣ful
and beloved brother." Colos. chap. iv.
ver. 7-9.</P>
<P N="2">2. "I beseech thee for my son Onesimus,
<HI>whom I have begotten in my bonds</HI>" (ver.
10). It appears from the preceding quota∣tion,
that Onesimus was with St. Paul when
he wrote the epistle to the Colossians; and
that he wrote that epistle <HI>in imprisonment</HI> is
evident from his declaration in the fourth
chapter and third verse: "Praying also for
us, that God would open unto us a door
of utterance, to speak the mystery of
Christ, for which I am also <HI>in bonds.</HI>"</P>
<P N="3">3. St. Paul bids Philemon prepare for
him a lodging: "For I trust," says he, "that,
through your prayers, I shall be given
unto you." This agrees with the expecta∣tion
of speedy deliverance, which he ex∣pressed
in another epistle written during
the same imprisonment: "Him" (Timo∣thy)
"I hope to send presently, so soon as
I shall see how it will go with me; <HI>but I</HI>
<PB N="371" REF="375"/><HI>trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come
shortly.</HI>" Phil. chap. ii. ver. 23, 24.</P>
<P N="4">4. As the letter to Philemon, and that to
the Colossians, were written at the same
time, and sent by the same messenger, the
one to a particular inhabitant, the other to
the church of Colosse, it may be expected
that the same, or nearly the same, persons
would be about St. Paul, and join with him,
as was the practice, in the salutations of the
epistle. Accordingly we find the names of
Aristarchus, Marcus, Epaphras, Luke, and
Demas, in both epistles. Timothy, who is
joined with St. Paul in the superscription of
the epistle to the Colossians, is joined with
him in this. Tychicus did not salute Phi∣lemon,
because he accompanied the epistle
to Colosse, and would undoubtedly there
see him. Yet the reader of the epistle to
Philemon will remark one considerable di∣versity
in the catalogue of saluting friends,
and which shows that the catalogue was not
copied from that to the Colossians. In the
epistle to the Colossians, Aristarchus is called
by St. Paul his fellow-prisoner, Colos. chap.
iv. ver. 10; in the epistle to Philemon, Aris∣tarchus
<PB N="372" REF="376"/>
is mentioned without any addition,
and the title of fellow-prisoner is given
to Epaphras<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Benson observes, and perhaps truly, that the appellation of fellow-prisoner, as applied by St. Paul to Epaphras, did not imply that they were imprisoned to∣gether <HI>at the time</HI>; any more than your calling a person your fellow-traveller, imports that you are then upon your travels. If he had, upon any former occasion, tra∣velled with you, you might afterwards speak of him under that title. It is just so with the term fellow-prisoner.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>And let it also be observed, that notwith∣standing
the close and circumstantial agree∣ment
between the two epistles, this is not
the case of an opening left in a genuine
writing, which an impostor is induced to fill
up; nor of a reference to some writing not
extant, which sets a sophist at work to sup∣ply
the loss, in like manner as, because St.
Paul was supposed, Colos. chap. iv. ver. 16,
to allude to an epistle written by him to the
Laodiceans, some person has from thence
taken the hint of uttering a forgery under
that title. The present, I say, is not that
case; for Philemon's name is not mentioned
in the epistle to the Colossians; Onesimus's
servile condition is no where hinted at, any
<PB N="373" REF="377"/>
more than his crime, his flight, or the place
or time of his conversion. The story there∣fore
of the epistle, if it be a fiction, is a fic∣tion
to which the author could not have
been guided, by any thing he had read in
St. Paul's genuine writings.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>No. III.</HEAD>
<P>Ver. 4, 5. "I thank my God, making
mention of thee always in my prayers;
hearing of thy love and faith, which thou
hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward
all saints."</P>
<P>"<HI>Hearing of thy love and faith.</HI>" This is
the form of speech which St. Paul was wont
to use towards those churches which he had
not seen, or then visited: see Rom. chap. i.
ver. 8; Ephes. chap. i. ver. 15; Col. chap. i.
ver. 3, 4. Toward those churches and
persons, with whom he was previously ac∣quainted,
he employed a different phrase; as,
"I thank my God always on your behalf,"
1 Cor. chap. i. ver. 4; 2 Thess. chap. i. ver.
3; or, "upon every <HI>remembrance</HI> of you,"
Phil. chap. i. ver. 3; 1 Thess. chap. i. ver. 2,
<PB N="374" REF="378"/>
3; 2 Tim. chap. i. ver. 3; and never speaks
<HI>of hearing of them.</HI> Yet, I think, it must be
concluded, from the nineteenth verse of this
epistle, that Philemon had been converted by
St. Paul himself: "Albeit, I do not say to
thee, how <HI>thou owest unto me</HI> even thine
own self besides." Here then is a peculiarity.
Let us enquire whether the epistle supplies
any circumstance which will account for it.
We have seen that it may be made out, not
from the epistle itself, but from a comparison
of the epistle with that to the Colossians, that
Philemon was an inhabitant of Colosse; and
it farther appears, from the epistle to the Co∣lossians,
that St. Paul had never been in that
city: "I would that ye knew what great con∣flict
I have for you and for them at Laodi∣cea,
and for as many as have not seen my
face in the flesh." Col. ch. ii. ver. 1. Al∣though,
therefore, St. Paul had formerly met
with Philemon at some other place, and had
been the immediate instrument of his con∣version,
yet Philemon's faith and conduct
afterwards, inasmuch as he lived in a city
which St. Paul had never visited, could only
be known to him by fame and reputation.</P>

<HEAD>No. IV.</HEAD>
<P>The tenderness and delicacy of this epistle
have been long admired: "Though I might
be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that
which is convenient, yet for love's sake
I rather beseech thee, being such a one as
Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of
Jesus Christ. I beseech thee for my son
Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my
bonds." There is something certainly very
melting and persuasive in this, and every
part of the epistle. Yet, in my opinion,
the character of St. Paul prevails in it
throughout. The warm, affectionate, au∣thoritative
teacher is interceding with an
absent friend for a beloved convert. He
urges his suit with an earnestness, befitting
perhaps not so much the occasion, as the ar∣dour
and sensibility of his own mind. Here
also, as every where, he shows himself con∣scious
of the weight and dignity of his mis∣sion;
nor does he suffer Philemon for a mo∣ment
to forget it: "I <HI>might</HI> be much bold
in Christ to enjoin thee that which is
<PB N="376" REF="380"/>
convenient." He is careful also to recal,
though obliquely, to Philemon's memory,
the sacred obligation under which he had
laid him, by bringing to him the knowledge
of Jesus Christ: "I do not say to thee, how
thou owest to me even thine own self
besides." Without laying aside, there∣fore,
the apostolic character, our author sof∣tens
the imperative style of his address, by
mixing with it every sentiment and consi∣deration
that could move the heart of his
correspondent. Aged and in prison, he is
content to supplicate and entreat. Onesi∣mus
was rendered dear to him by his con∣version
and his services; the child of his
affliction, and "ministering unto him in the
bonds of the gospel." This ought to re∣commend
him, whatever had been his fault,
to Philemon's forgiveness: "Receive him as
myself, as my own bowels." Every thing,
however, should be voluntary. St. Paul
was determined that Philemon's compliance
should flow from his own bounty: "With∣out
thy mind would I do nothing, that
thy benefit should not be as it were of
necessity, but willingly:" trusting never∣theless
<PB N="377" REF="381"/>
to his gratitude and attachment for
the performance of all that he requested,
and for more: "Having confidence in thy
obedience, I wrote unto thee, knowing
that thou wilt also do more than I say."</P>
<P>St. Paul's discourse at Miletus; his speech
before Agrippa; his epistle to the Romans, as
hath been remarked (No. VIII.); that to the
Galatians, chap. iv. ver. 11-20; to the Phi∣lippians,
chap. i. ver. 29-ch. ii. ver. 2; the
second to the Corinthians, chap. vi. ver. 1-
13; and indeed some part or other of almost
every epistle, exhibits examples of a similar
application to the feelings and affections of
the persons whom he addresses. And it is ob∣servable,
that these pathetic effusions, drawn
for the most part from his own sufferings
and situation, usually precede a command,
soften a rebuke, or mitigate the harshness of
some disagreeable truth.</P>

<HEAD>THE SUBSCRIPTIONS OF THE EPISTLES.</HEAD>
<P>SIX of these <HI>subscriptions</HI> are false or im∣probable;
that is, they are either abso∣lutely
contradicted by the contents of the
epistle, or are difficult to be reconciled
with them.</P>
<P N="1">I. The subscription of the first epistle to the
Corinthians states that it was written from
Philippi, notwithstanding that, in the six∣teenth
chapter and the eighth verse of the
epistle, St. Paul informs the Corinthians,
that he will "tarry at Ephesus until Pente∣cost;"
and notwithstanding that he begins
the salutations in the epistle, by telling them
"the churches of Asia salute you;" a pretty
evident indication that he himself was in
Asia at this time.</P>
<P N="2">II. The epistle to the Galatians is by the
subscription dated from Rome; yet, in the
epistle itself, St. Paul expresses his surprise
<PB N="379" REF="383"/>
"that they were <HI>so soon</HI> removed from him
that called them;" whereas his journey to
Rome was ten years posterior to the con∣version
of the Galatians. And what, I
think, is more conclusive, the author, though
speaking of himself in this more than any
other epistle, does not once mention his
bonds, or call himself a prisoner; which he
has not failed to do in every one of the four
epistles written from that city, and during
that imprisonment.</P>
<P N="3">III. The first epistle to the Thessalonians
was written, the subscription tells us, from
Athens; yet the epistle refers expressly to
the coming of Timotheus from Thessalo∣nica
(ch. iii. ver. 6); and the history in∣forms
us, Acts xviii. ver. 5, that Timo∣thy
came out of Macedonia to St. Paul at
<HI>Corinth.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. The second epistle to the Thessalo∣nians
is dated, and without any discover∣able
reason, from Athens also. If it be
truly the <HI>second</HI>; if it refer, as it appears to
do (ch. ii. ver. 2), to the first, and the first
was written from Corinth, the place must
be erroneously assigned, for the history does
<PB N="380" REF="384"/>
not allow us to suppose that St. Paul, after he
had reached Corinth, went back to Athens.</P>
<P N="5">V. The first epistle to Timothy the sub∣scription
asserts to have been sent from Lao∣dicea;
yet, when St. Paul writes, "I be∣sought
thee to abide still at Ephesus,
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (when I set
out for Macedonia)," the reader is na∣turally
led to conclude, that he wrote the
letter upon his arrival in that country.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The epistle to Titus is dated from
Nicopolis in Macedonia, whilst no city of
that name is known to have existed in that
province.</P>
<P>The use, and the only use, which I make
of these observations, is to show, how easily
errors and contradictions steal in where the
writer is not guided by original knowledge.
There are only eleven distinct assignments
of date to St. Paul's epistles (for the four
written from Rome may be considered as
plainly cotemporary); and of these, six seem
to be erroneous. I do not attribute any
authority to these subscriptions. I believe
them to have been conjectures founded
sometimes upon loose traditions, but more
<PB N="381" REF="385"/>
generally upon a consideration of some par∣ticular
text, without sufficiently comparing
it with other parts of the epistle, with diffe∣rent
epistles, or with the history. Suppose
then that the subscriptions had come down
to us as authentic parts of the epistles, there
would have been more contrarieties and dif∣ficulties
arising out of these final verses, than
from all the rest of the volume. Yet, if the
epistles had been forged, the whole must
have been made up of the same elements as
those of which the subscriptions are com∣posed,
viz. tradition, conjecture, and infe∣rence:
and it would have remained to be
accounted for, how, whilst so many errors
were crowded into the concluding clauses of
the letters, so much consistency should be
preserved in other parts.</P>
<P>The same reflection arises from observing
the oversights and mistakes which learned
men have committed, when arguing upon
allusions which relate to time and place, or
when endeavouring to digest scattered cir∣cumstances
into a continued story. It is
indeed the same case; for these subscrip∣tions
must be regarded as ancient scholia,
<PB N="382" REF="386"/>
and as nothing more. Of this liability to
error I can present the reader with a no∣table
instance; and which I bring forward
for no other purpose than that to which
I apply the erroneous subscriptions. Ludo∣vicus
Capellus, in that part of his Historia Apo∣stolica
Illustrata, which is entitled <HI>De Ordine</HI>
Epist. Paul. writing upon the second epistle
to the Corinthians, triumphs unmercifully
over the want of sagacity in Baronius, who,
it seems, makes St. Paul write his epistle to
Titus from Macedonia upon his second visit
into that province; whereas it appears from
the history, that Titus, instead of being in
Crete where the epistle places him, was at
that time sent by the apostle from Mace∣donia
to Corinth. "Animadvertere est,"
says Capellus, "magnam hominis illius
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, qui vult Titum a Paulo in Cre∣tam
abductum, illicque relictum, cum inde
Nicopolim navigaret, quem tamen agnoscit
a Paulo ex Macedoniâ missum esse Corin∣thum."
This probably will be thought
a detection of inconsistency in Baronius.
But what is the most remarkable, is, that
in the same chapter in which he thus in∣dulges
his contempt of Baronius's judg∣ment,
<PB N="383" REF="387"/>
Capellus himself falls into an error of
the same kind, and more gross and palpable
than that which he reproves. For he be∣gins
the chapter by stating the second
epistle to the Corinthians and the first epistle
to Timothy to be nearly cotemporary; to
have been both written during the apostle's
second visit into Macedonia; and that a
doubt subsisted concerning the immediate
priority of their dates: "Posterior ad eosdem
Corinthios epistola, et prior ad Timo∣theum
certant de prioritate, et sub judice
lis est; utraque autem scripta est paulo
postquam Paulus Epheso discessisset, adeo∣que
dum Macedoniam peragraret, sed
utra tempore praecedat, non liquet." Now,
in the first place, it is highly improbable
that the two epistles should have been writ∣ten
either nearly together, or during the
same journey through Macedonia; for in
the epistle to the Corinthians, Timothy ap∣pears
to have been <HI>with</HI> St. Paul: in the
epistle addressed to him, to have been left be∣hind
at Ephesus, and not only left behind,
but directed to continue there, till St. Paul
should return to that city. In the second
<PB N="384" REF="388"/>
place it is inconceivable, that a question
should be proposed concerning the priority
of date of the two epistles; for, when St.
Paul, in his epistle to Timothy, opens his ad∣dress
to him by saying, "as I besought thee
to abide still at Ephesus when I went into
Macedonia," no reader can doubt but
that he here refers to the <HI>last</HI> interview
which had passed between them; that he
had not seen him since; whereas if the
epistle be posterior to that to the Co∣rinthians,
yet written upon the same visit
into Macedonia, this could not be true; for
as Timothy was along with St. Paul
when he wrote to the Corinthians, he
must, upon this supposition, have passed
over to St. Paul in Macedonia after he had
been left by him at Ephesus, and must
have returned to Ephesus again before the
epistle was written. What misled Ludo∣vicus
Capellus was simply this, that he had
entirely overlooked Timothy's name in the
superscription of the second epistle to the
Corinthians. Which oversight appears not
only in the quotation which we have given,
<PB N="385" REF="389"/>
but from his telling us, as he does, that
Timothy came from Ephesus to St. Paul at
<HI>Corinth,</HI> whereas the superscription proves
that Timothy was already with St. Paul
when he wrote to the Corinthians from
Macedonia.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD>THE CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>IN the outset of this enquiry, the reader
was directed to consider the Acts of the
Apostles and the thirteen epistles of St. Paul
as certain ancient manuscripts lately disco∣vered
in the closet of some celebrated library.
We have adhered to this view of the sub∣ject.
External evidence of every kind has
been removed out of sight; and our endea∣vours
have been employed to collect the in∣dications
of truth and authenticity, which
appeared to exist in the writings themselves,
and to result from a comparison of their
different parts. It is not however necessary
to continue this supposition longer. The tes∣timony
which other remains of cotemporary,
or the monuments of adjoining ages afford
to the reception, notoriety, and public esti∣mation
of a book, form no doubt the first
proof of its genuineness. And in no books
whatever is this proof more complete, than
<PB N="387" REF="391"/>
in those at present under our consideration.
The enquiries of learned men, and, above
all, of the excellent Lardner, who never
overstates a point of evidence, and whose
fidelity in citing his authorities has in no
one instance been impeached, have esta∣blished,
concerning these writings, the fol∣lowing
propositions:</P>
<P N="1">I. That in the age immediately posterior
to that in which St. Paul lived, his letters
were publickly read and acknowledged.</P>
<P>Some of them are quoted or alluded to
by almost every Christian writer that fol∣lowed,
by Clement of Rome, by Hermas,
by Ignatius, by Polycarp, disciples or co∣temporaries
of the apostles; by Justin Mar∣tyr,
by the churches of Gaul, by Irenaeus,
by Athenagoras, by Theophilus, by Cle∣ment
of Alexandria, by Hermias, by Ter∣tullian,
who occupied the succeeding age.
Now when we find a book quoted or re∣ferred
to by an ancient author, we are en∣titled
to conclude, that it was read and re∣ceived
in the age and country in which that
author lived. And this conclusion does not,
in any degree, rest upon the judgment or
<PB N="388" REF="392"/>
character of the author making such refe∣rence.
Proceeding by this rule, we have,
concerning the first epistle to the Corin∣thians
in particular, within forty years after
the epistle was written, evidence, not only
of its being extant at Corinth, but of its
being known and read at Rome. Clement,
bishop of that city, writing to the church
of Corinth, uses these words: "Take into
your hands the epistle of the blessed Paul
the apostle. What did he at first write
unto you in the beginning of the gospel?
Verily he did by the spirit admonish you
concerning himself and Cephas and Apol∣los,
because that even then you did form
parties<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Lardner, vol. xii. p. 22.</NOTE>." This was written at a time
when probably some must have been living
at Corinth, who remembered St. Paul's mi∣nistry
there and the receipt of the epistle.
The testimony is still more valuable, as it
shows that the epistles were preserved in
the churches to which they were sent, and
that they were spread and propagated from
them to the rest of the Christian commu∣nity.
Agreeably to which natural mode
<PB N="389" REF="393"/>
and order of their publication, Tertullian,
a century afterwards, for proof of the inte∣grity
and genuineness of the apostolic writ∣ings,
bids "any one, who is willing to exer∣cise
his curiosity profitably in the business
of their salvation, to visit the apostolical
churches, in which their very authentic
letters are recited, ipsae authenticae literae
eorum recitantur." Then he goes on: "Is
Achaia near you? You have Corinth. If
you are not far from Macedonia, you have
Philippi, you have Thessalonica. If you
can go to Asia, you have Ephesus; but if
you are near to Italy, you have Rome<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lardner, vol. ii. p. 598.</NOTE>."
I adduce this passage to show, that the distinct
churches or Christian societies, to which St.
Paul's epistles were sent, subsisted for some
ages afterwards; that his several epistles were
all along respectively read in those churches;
that Christians at large received them from
those churches, and appealed to those
churches for their original and authenticity.</P>
<P>Arguing in like manner from citations
and allusions, we have, within the space of
a hundred and fifty years from the time
<PB N="390" REF="394"/>
that the first of St. Paul's epistles was writ∣ten,
proofs of almost all of them being read,
in Palestine, Syria, the countries of Asia
Minor, in Egypt, in that part of Africa
which used the Latin tongue, in Greece,
Italy, and Gaul<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Lardner's Recapitulation, vol. xii. p. 53.</NOTE>. I do not mean simply
to assert, that, within the space of a hun∣dred
and fifty years, St. Paul's epistles were
read in those countries, for I believe that
they were read and circulated from the be∣ginning;
but that proofs of their being so
read occur within that period. And when
it is considered how few of the primitive
Christians wrote, and of what was written
how much is lost, we are to account it ex∣traordinary,
or rather as a sure proof of the
extensiveness of the reputation of these
writings, and of the general respect in
which they were held, that so many testi∣monies,
and of such antiquity, are still ex∣tant.
"In the remaining works of Ire∣naeus,
Clement of Alexandria, and Ter∣tullian,
there are perhaps more and
larger quotations of the small volume of
the New Testament, than of all the works
<PB N="391" REF="395"/>
of Cicero, in the writings of all characters
for several ages<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Lardner's Recapitulation, vol. xii. p. 53.</NOTE>." We must add, that
the epistles of Paul come in for their full
share of this observation; and that all the
thirteen epistles, except that to Philemon,
which is not quoted by Irenaeus or Clement,
and which probably escaped notice merely
by its brevity, are severally cited, and ex∣pressly
recognized as St. Paul's, by each of
these Christian writers. The Ebionites, an
early, though inconsiderable Christian sect,
rejected St. Paul and his epistles<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lardner, vol. ii. p. 808.</NOTE>; that is,
they rejected these epistles, not because they
were not, but because they were St. Paul's;
and because, adhering to the obligation of
the Jewish law, they chose to dispute his
doctrine and authority. Their suffrage as
to the genuineness of the epistles does not
contradict that of other Christians. Mar∣cion,
an heretical writer in the former part
of the second century, is said by Tertullian to
have rejected three of the epistles which we
now receive, viz. the two epistles to Timo∣thy
and the epistle to Titus. It appears to
<PB N="392" REF="396"/>
me not improbable, that Marcion might
make some such distinction as this, that no
apostolic epistle was to be admitted which
was not read or attested by the church to
which it was sent; for it is remarkable that,
together with these epistles to private per∣sons,
he rejected also the catholic epistles.
Now the catholic epistles and the epistles to
private persons agree in the circumstance of
wanting this particular species of attestation.
Marcion, it seems, acknowledged the epistle
to Philemon, and is upbraided for his incon∣sistency
in doing so by Tertullian<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lardner, vol. xiv. p. 455.</NOTE>, who
asks "why, when he received a letter writ∣ten
to a single person, he should refuse
two to Timothy and one to Titus com∣posed
upon the affairs of the church?"
This passage so far favours our account of
Marcion's objection, as it shows that the
objection was supposed by Tertullian to
have been founded in something, which be∣longed
to the nature of a private letter.</P>
<P>Nothing of the works of Marcion re∣mains.
Probably he was, after all, a rash,
arbitrary, licentious critic (if he deserved
<PB N="393" REF="397"/>
indeed the name of critic) and who offered
no reason for his determination. What St.
Jerome says of him intimates this, and is be∣side
founded in good sense; speaking of him
and Basilides, "if they had assigned any rea∣sons,"
says he, "why they did not reckon
these epistles," viz. the first and second to
Timothy and the epistle to Titus, "to be
the apostle's, we would have endeavoured
to have answered them, and perhaps
might have satisfied the reader; but when
they take upon them, by their own au∣thority,
to pronounce one epistle to be
Paul's, and another not, they can only be
replied to in the same manner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lardner, vol. xiv. p. 458.</NOTE>." Let it be
remembered, however, that Marcion re∣ceived
ten of these epistles. His authority
therefore, even if his credit had been better
than it is, forms a very small exception to
the uniformity of the evidence. Of Basilides
we know still less than we do of Marcion.
The same observation however belongs to
him, viz. that his objection, as far as appears
from this passage of St. Jerome, was con∣fined
<PB N="394" REF="398"/>
to the three private epistles. Yet is
this the only opinion which can be said to
disturb the consent of the two first centuries
of the Christian aera; for as to Tatian, who
is reported by Jerome alone to have reject∣ed
some of St. Paul's epistles, the extrava∣gant
or rather delirious notions into which
he fell, take away all weight and credit from
his judgment. If, indeed, Jerome's account
of this circumstance be correct; for it ap∣pears
from much older writers than Jerome,
that Tatian owned and used many of these
epistles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lardner, vol. i. p. 313.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="2">II. They, who in those ages disputed about
so many other points, agreed in acknow∣ledging
the scriptures now before us. Con∣tending
sects appealed to them in their con∣troversies
with equal and unreserved sub∣mission.
When they were urged by one
side, however they might be interpreted or
misinterpreted by the other, their authority
was not questioned: "Reliqui omnes," says
Irenaeus, speaking of Marcion, "falso sci∣entiae
nomine inflati, scripturas quidem
<PB N="395" REF="399"/>
confitentur, interpretationes vero conver∣tunt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Iren. advers. Haer. quoted by Lardner, vol. xv. p. 425.</NOTE>."</P>
<P N="3">III. When the genuineness of some other
writings which were in circulation, and
even of a few which are now received into
the canon, was contested, these were never
called into dispute. Whatever was the ob∣jection,
or whether, in truth, there ever was
any real objection to the authenticity of the
second epistle of Peter, the second and third
of John, the epistle of James, or that of
Jude, or to the book of the Revelations of
St. John, the doubts that appear to have
been entertained concerning them, exceed∣ingly
strengthen the force of the testimony
as to those writings, about which there was
no doubt; because it shows, that the matter
was a subject, amongst the early Christians,
of examination and discussion; and that,
where there was any room to doubt, they
did doubt.</P>
<P>What Eusebius hath left upon the sub∣ject
is directly to the purpose of this ob∣servation.
Eusebius, it is well known, di∣vided
<PB N="396" REF="400"/>
the ecclesiastical writings which were
extant in his time into three classes; the
"<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> uncontradicted," as he calls
them in one chapter; or "scriptures uni∣versally
acknowledged," as he calls them
in another; the "controverted, yet well
known and approved by many;" and
"the spurious." What were the shades of
difference in the books of the second, or in
those of the third class; or what it was pre∣cisely
that he meant by the term <HI>spurious,</HI> it
is not necessary in this place to enquire.
It is sufficient for us to find, that the thir∣teen
epistles of St. Paul are placed by him
in the first class without any sort of hesita∣tion
or doubt.</P>
<P>It is farther also to be collected from the
chapter in which this distinction is laid
down, that the method made use of by
Eusebius, and by the Christians of his time,
viz. the close of the third century, in
judging concerning the sacred authority of
any books, was to enquire after and con∣sider
the testimony of those who lived near
the age of the apostles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lardner, vol. viii. p. 106.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="397" REF="401"/>
IV. That no ancient writing, which is
attested as these epistles are, hath had its
authenticity disproved, or is in fact ques∣tioned.
The controversies which have been
moved concerning suspected writings, as the
epistles, for instance, of Phalaris, or the
eighteen epistles of Cicero, begin by show∣ing
that this attestation is wanting. That
being proved, the question is thrown back
upon internal marks of spuriousness or au∣thenticity;
and in these the dispute is occu∣pied.
In which disputes it is to be ob∣served,
that the contested writings are com∣monly
attacked by arguments drawn from
some opposition which they betray to "au∣thentic
history," to "true epistles," to "the
real sentiments or circumstances of the au∣thor
whom they personate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the tracts written in the controversy between Tunstal and Middleton upon certain suspected epistles ascribed to Cicero.</NOTE>;" which au∣thentic
history, which true epistles, which
real sentiments themselves, are no other
than ancient documents, whose early exist∣ence
and reception can be proved, in the
manner in which the writings before us
<PB N="398" REF="402"/>
are traced up to the age of their reputed
author, or to ages near to his. A modern
who sits down to compose the history of
some ancient period, has no stronger evi∣dence
to appeal to for the most confident
assertion, or the most undisputed fact, that
he delivers, than writings, whose genuine∣ness
is proved by the same medium through
which we evince the authenticity of ours.
Nor, whilst he can have recourse to such
authorities as these, does he apprehend any
uncertainty in his accounts, from the sus∣picion
of spuriousness or imposture in his
materials.</P>
<P N="5">V. It cannot be shown that any forgeries
properly so called<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I believe that there is a great deal of truth in Dr. Lardner's observations, that comparatively few of those books, which we call apocryphal, were strictly and originally forgeries. See Lardner, vol. xii. p. 167.</NOTE>, that is, writings pub∣lished
under the name of the person who
did not compose them, made their appear∣ance
in the first century of the Christian aera,
in which century these epistles undoubtedly
existed. I shall set down under this pro∣position
the guarded words of Lardner him∣self:
<PB N="399" REF="403"/>
"There are no quotations of any of
them (spurious and apocryphal books) in
the apostolical fathers, by whom I mean
Barnabas, Clement of Rome, Hermas,
Ignatius, and Polycarp, whose writings
reach from the year of our Lord 70 to
the year 108. <HI>I say this confidently, because
I think it has been proved.</HI>" Lardner,
vol. xii. p. 158.</P>
<P>Nor when they did appear were they
much used by the primitive Christians,
"Irenaeus quotes not any of these books.
He mentions some of them, but he never
quotes them. The same may be said of
Tertullian: he has mentioned a book
called "Acts of Paul and Thecla;" but it is
only to condemn it. Clement of Alexan∣dria
and Origen have mentioned and quot∣ed
several such books, but never as autho∣rity,
and sometimes with express marks of
dislike. Eusebius quotes no such books
in any of his works. He has mentioned
them indeed, but how? Not by way of
approbation, but to show that they were
of little or no value; and that they never
were received by the sounder part of
<PB N="400" REF="404"/>
Christians." Now, if with this, which is
advanced after the most minute and diligent
examination, we compare what the same
cautious writer had before said of our re∣ceived
scriptures, "that in the works of
three only of the above-mentioned fa∣thers,
there are more and larger quota∣tions
of the small volume of the New
Testament, than of all the works of Ci∣cero
in the writers of all characters for
several ages;" and if, with the marks of ob∣scurity
or condemnation, which accompa∣nied
the mention of the several apocryphal
Christian writings, when they happened
to be mentioned at all, we contrast what
Dr. Lardner's work completely and in detail
makes out concerning the writings which
we defend, and what, having so made out,
he thought himself authorized in his con∣clusion
to assert, that these books were not
only received from the beginning, but
received with the greatest respect; have
been publickly and solemnly read in the as∣semblies
of Christians throughout the world,
in every age from that time to this; early
translated into the languages of divers coun∣tries
<PB N="401" REF="405"/>
and people; commentaries writ to ex∣plain
and illustrate them; quoted by way
of proof in all arguments of a religious na∣ture;
recommended to the perusal of unbe∣lievers,
as containing the authentic account
of the Christian doctrine; when we attend,
I say, to this representation, we perceive in
it, not only full proof of the early notoriety
of these books, but a clear and sensible line
of discrimination, which separates these from
the pretensions of any others.</P>
<P>The epistles of St. Paul stand particularly
free of any doubt or confusion that might
arise from this source. Until the conclu∣sion
of the fourth century, no intimation
appears of any attempt whatever being
made to counterfeit these writings; and
then it appears only of a single and obscure
instance. Jerome, who flourished in the
year 392, has this expression: "Legunt qui∣dam
et ad Laodicenses; sed ab omnibus
exploditur;" there is also an epistle to the
Laodiceans, but it is rejected by every
body<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lardner, vol. x. p. 103.</NOTE>. Theodoret, who wrote in the year
423, speaks of this epistle in the same
<PB N="402" REF="406"/>
terms<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lardner, vol. xi. p. 88.</NOTE>. Beside these I know not whether
any ancient writer mentions it. It was cer∣tainly
unnoticed during the three first cen∣turies
of the church; and when it came af∣terwards
to be mentioned, it was mentioned
only to show, that, though such a writing
did exist, it obtained no credit. It is pro∣bable
that the forgery to which Jerome al∣ludes,
is the epistle which we now have un∣der
that title. If so, as hath been already
observed, it is nothing more than a collec∣tion
of sentences from the genuine epistles;
and was perhaps, at first, rather the exercise
of some idle pen, than any serious attempt
to impose a forgery upon the public. Of
an epistle to the Corinthians under St. Paul's
name, which was brought into Europe in
the present century, antiquity is entirely si∣lent.
It was unheard of for sixteen cen∣turies;
and at this day, though it be extant,
and was first found in the Armenian lan∣guage,
it is not, by the Christians of that
country, received into their scriptures. I
hope, after this, that there is no reader who
will think there is any competition of cre∣dit,
<PB N="403" REF="407"/>
or of external proof, between these and
the received epistles; or rather who will
not acknowledge the evidence of authenti∣city
to be confirmed by the want of success
which attended imposture.</P>
<P>When we take into our hands the letters
which the suffrage and consent of antiquity
hath thus transmitted to us, the first thing
that strikes our attention is the air of reality
and business, as well as of seriousness and
conviction, which pervades the whole. Let
the sceptic read them. If he be not sen∣sible
of these qualities in them, the argu∣ment
can have no weight with him. If he
be; if he perceive in almost every page the
language of a mind, actuated by real occa∣sions,
and operating upon real circum∣stances,
I would wish it to be observed, that
the proof which arises from this perception
is not to be deemed occult or imaginary,
because it is incapable of being drawn out
in words, or of being conveyed to the ap∣prehension
of the reader in any other way,
than by sending him to the books them∣selves.</P>
<P>And here, in its proper place, comes in
<PB N="404" REF="408"/>
the argument which it has been the office of
these pages to unfold. St. Paul's epistles
are connected with his history by their par∣ticularity,
and by the numerous circum∣stances
which are found in them. When
we descend to an examination and compa∣rion
of these circumstances, we not only
observe the history and the epistles to be
independent documents, unknown to, or at
least unconsulted by, each other, but we find
the substance, and oftentimes very minute
articles, of the history, recognized in the
epistles, by allusions and references, which
can neither be imputed to <HI>design,</HI> nor, with∣out
a foundation in truth, be accounted for
by accident, by hints and expressions and
single words dropping as it were fortui∣tously
from the pen of the writer, or drawn
forth, each by some occasion proper to the
place in which it occurs, but widely re∣moved
from any view to consistency or
agreement. These, we know, are effects
which reality naturally produces, but which,
without reality at the bottom, can hardly
be conceived to exist.</P>
<P>When therefore, with a body of external
<PB N="405" REF="409"/>
evidence, which is relied upon, and which ex∣perience
proves may safely be relied upon, in
appreciating the credit of ancient writings,
we combine characters of genuineness and
originality which are not found, and which,
in the nature and order of things, cannot be
expected to be found in spurious compo∣sitions;
whatever difficulties we may meet
with in other topics of the Christian evi∣dence,
we can have little in yielding our
assent to the following conclusions: that
there was such a person as St. Paul; that he
lived in the age which we ascribe to him;
that he went about preaching the religion of
which Jesus Christ was the founder; and that
the letters which we now read were actually
written by him upon the subject, and in the
course, of that his ministry.</P>
<P>And if it be true that we are in possession of
the very letters which St. Paul wrote, let us
consider what confirmation they afford to
the Christian history. In my opinion they
substantiate the whole transaction. The
great object of modern research is to come at
the epistolary correspondence of the times.
A midst the obscurities, the silence, or the
<PB N="406" REF="410"/>
contradictions of history, if a letter can be
found, we regard it as the discovery of a
land-mark; as that by which we can correct,
adjust, or supply the imperfections and un∣certainties
of other accounts. One cause
of the superior credit which is attributed to
letters is this, that the facts which they
disclose generally come out <HI>incidentally,</HI> and
therefore without design to mislead the pub∣lic
by false or exaggerated accounts. This
reason may be applied to St. Paul's epistles
with as much justice as to any letters what∣ever.
Nothing could be farther from the
intention of the writer than to record any
part of his history. That his history was
<HI>in fact</HI> made public by these letters, and has
by the same means been transmitted to fu∣ture
ages, is a secondary and unthought of
effect. The sincerity therefore of the
apostle's declarations cannot reasonably be
disputed; at least we are sure that it was not
vitiated by any desire of setting himself off
to the public at large. But these letters
form a part of the muniments of Christia∣nity,
as much to be valued for their con∣tents,
as for their originality. A more in∣estimable
<PB N="407" REF="411"/>
treasure the care of antiquity could
not have sent down to us. Beside the proof
they afford of the general reality of St.
Paul's history, of the knowledge which the
author of the Acts of the Apostles had ob∣tained
of that history, and the consequent
probability that he was, what he professes him∣self
to have been, a companion of the apostle's;
beside the support they lend to these impor∣tant
inferences, they meet specisically some
of the principal objections upon which
the adversaries of Christianity have thought
proper to rely. In particular they show,</P>
<P N="1">I. That Christianity was not a story set
on foot amidst the confusions which attend∣ed
and immediately preceded the destruc∣tion
of Jerusalem; when many extravagant
reports were circulated, when men's minds
were broken by terror and distress, when
amidst the tumults that surrounded them en∣quiry
was impracticable. These letters show
incontestably that the religion had sixed and
established itself before this state of things
took place.</P>
<P N="2">II. Whereas it hath been insinuated, that
our gospels may have been made up of re∣ports
<PB N="408" REF="412"/>
and stories, which were current at the
time, we may observe that, with respect to
the epistles, this is impossible. A man can∣not
write the history of his own life from
reports; nor, what is the same thing, be led
by reports to refer to passages and transac∣tions
in which he states himself to have been
immediately present and active. I do not
allow that this insinuation is applied to the
historical part of the New Testament with
any colour of justice or probability; but
I say, that to the epistles it is not appli∣cable
at all.</P>
<P N="3">III. These letters prove that the converts
to Christianity were not drawn from the bar∣barous,
the mean, or the ignorant set of
men, which the representations of infidelity
would sometimes make them. We learn
from letters the character not only of the
writer, but, in some measure, of the persons
to whom they are written. To suppose
that these letters were addressed to a rude
tribe, incapable of thought or reflection,
is just as reasonable as to suppose Locke's
Essay on the Human Understanding to have
been written for the instruction of savages.
<PB N="409" REF="413"/>
Whatever may be thought of these letters
in other respects, either of diction or argu∣ment,
they are certainly removed as far as
possible from the habits and comprehension
of a barbarous people.</P>
<P N="4">IV. St. Paul's history, I mean so much of
it as may be collected from his letters, is so
<HI>implicated</HI> with that of the other apostles,
and with the substance indeed of the Chris∣tian
history itself, that I apprehend it will
be found impossible to admit St. Paul's story
(I do not speak of the miraculous part of it)
to be true, and yet to reject the rest as fa∣bulous.
For instance, can any one believe
that there was such a man as Paul, a preacher
of Christianity in the age which we assign to
him, and <HI>not</HI> believe that there were also at
the same time such men as Peter and James,
and other apostles, who had been compa∣nions
of Christ during his life, and who af∣ter
his death published and avowed the
same things concerning him which Paul
taught? Judea, and especially Jerusalem,
was the scene of Christ's ministry. The
witnesses of his miracles lived there. St.
Paul, by his own account, as well as that of
<PB N="410" REF="414"/>
his historian, appears to have frequently vi∣sited
this city; to have carried on a commu∣nication
with the church there; to have as∣sociated
with the rulers and elders of that
church, who were some of them apostles;
to have acted, as occasions offered, in corre∣spondence,
and sometimes in conjuntion
with them. Can it, after this, be doubted,
but that the religion and the general facts
relating to it, which St. Paul appears by his
letters to have delivered to the several
churches which he established at a dis∣tance,
were, at the same time, taught and
published at Jerusalem itself, the place where
the business was transacted; and taught and
published by those who had attended the
founder of the institution in his miraculous,
or pretendedly miraculous, ministry?</P>
<P>It is observable, for so it appears both in
the epistles and from the Acts of the Apostles,
that Jerusalem, and the society of believers
in that city, long continued the centre from
which the missionaries of the religion issued,
with which all other churches maintained a
correspondence and connection, to which
they referred their doubts, and to whose re∣lief,
<PB N="411" REF="415"/>
in times of public distress, they remitted
their charitable assistance. This observation
I think material, because it proves that this
was not the case of giving out accounts in
one country of what is transacted in ano∣ther,
without affording the hearers an oppor∣tunity
of knowing whether the things re∣lated
were credited by any, or even publish∣ed,
in the place where they are reported to
have passed.</P>
<P N="5">V. St. Paul's letters furnish evidence (and
what better evidence than a man's own let∣ters
can be desired?) of the soundness and
sobriety of his judgment. His caution in
distinguishing between the occasional sugges∣tions
of inspiration, and the ordinary exer∣cise
of his natural understanding, is without
example in the history of human enthu∣siasm.
His morality is every where calm,
pure, and rational; adapted to the condi∣tion,
the activity, and the business of social
life, and of its various relations; free from
the over-scrupulousness and austerities of
superstition, and from, what was more per∣haps
to be apprehended, the abstractions of
quietism, and the soarings or extravagancies
<PB N="412" REF="416"/>
of fanaticism. His judgment concerning a
hesitating conscience; his opinion of the
moral indifferency of many actions, yet of
the prudence and even the duty of compli∣ance,
where non-compliance would produce
evil effects upon the minds of the persons
who observed it, is as correct and just as
the most liberal and enlightened moralist
could form at this day. The accuracy of
modern ethics has found nothing to amend
in these determinations.</P>
<P>What Lord Lyttelton has remarked of the
preference ascribed by St. Paul to inward
rectitude of principle above every other re∣ligious
accomplishment, is very material, to
our present purpose. "In his first epistle
to the Corinthians, ch. xiii. ver. 1-3,
St. Paul has these words: <HI>Though I speak
with the tongues of men and of angels, and
have not charity, I am become as sounding
brass, or a tinkling cymbal. And though I have
the gift of prophecy, and understand all mys∣teries
and all knowledge, and though I have
all faith, so that I could remove mountains,
and have not charity, I am nothing. And
though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor,</HI><PB N="413" REF="417"/>
<HI>and though I give my body to be burned,
and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.</HI>
Is this the language of enthusiasm?
Did ever enthusiast prefer that univer∣sal
benevolence which comprehendeth
all moral virtues, and which, as appeareth
by the following verses, is meant by cha∣rity
here; did ever enthusiast, I say, pre∣fer
that benevolence" (which we may add
is attainable by every man) "to faith and
to miracles, to those religious opinions
which he had embraced, and to those su∣pernatural
graces and gifts which he
imagined he had acquired; nay even to
the merit of martyrdom? Is it not the
genius of enthusiasm to set moral virtues
infinitely below the merit of faith; and of
all moral virtues to value that least which
is most particularly enforced by St. Paul,
a spirit of candour, moderation, and
peace? Certainly neither the temper nor
the opinions of a man subject to fanatic
delusions are to be found in this passage."—Lord
Lyttelton's Considerations on the
Conversion, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I see no reason therefore to question the
<PB N="414" REF="418"/>
integrity of his understanding. To call him
a visionary, because he appealed to visions;
or an enthusiast, because he pretended to
inspiration, is to take the whole question for
granted. It is to take for granted that no
such visions or inspirations existed; at least
it is to assume, contrary to his own asser∣tions,
that he had no other proofs than these
to offer of his mission, or of the truth of his
relations.</P>
<P>One thing I allow, that his letters every
where discover great zeal and earnestness in
the cause in which he was engaged; that is
to say, he was convinced of the truth of
what he taught; he was deeply impressed,
but not more so than the occasion merited,
with a sense of its importance. This pro∣duces
a corresponding animation and soli∣citude
in the exercise of his ministry. But
would not these considerations, supposing
them to be well founded, have holden the
same place, and produced the same effect, in
a mind the strongest and the most sedate?</P>
<P N="6">VI. These letters are decisive as to the
sufferings of the author; also as to the dis∣tressed
state of the Christian church, and
<PB N="415" REF="419"/>
the dangers which attended the preaching
of the gospel.</P>
<P>"Whereof I Paul am made a minister,
who now rejoice in my sufferings for you,
and fill up that which is behind of the
afflictions of Christ in my flesh, for his
body's sake, which is the church."—Col.
ch. i. ver. 24.</P>
<P>"If in this life only we have hope in
Christ, we are of all men the most mise∣rable."
1 Cor. ch. xv. ver. 19.</P>
<P>"Why stand we in jeopardy every hour?
I protest by your rejoicing, which I have
in Christ Jesus, I die daily. If, after the
manner of men, I have fought with beasts
at Ephesus, what advantageth it me if the
dead rise not?" 1 Cor. ch. xv. ver. 30,
&amp;c.</P>
<P>"If children, then heirs; heirs of God, and
joint-heirs with Christ: if so be that we suf∣fer
with him, that we may be also glorified
together. For I reckon that the sufferings of
this present time are not worthy to be
compared with the glory that shall be re∣vealed
in us." Rom. ch. viii. ver. 17, 18.</P>
<P><PB N="416" REF="420"/>
"Who shall separate us from the love of
Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or
persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or
peril, or sword? As it is written, For thy
sake we are killed all the day long; we are
accounted as sheep for the slaughter."
Rom. chap. viii. ver. 35, 36.</P>
<P>"Rejoicing in hope, <HI>patient in tribulation,</HI>
continuing instant in prayer." Rom. chap.
xii. ver. 12.</P>
<P>"Now concerning virgins I have no
commandment of the Lord; yet I give
my judgment as one that hath obtained
mercy of the Lord to be faithful. I sup∣pose
therefore that this is good <HI>for the
present distress</HI>; I say, that it is good for a
man so to be." 1 Cor. ch. vii. ver. 25, 26.</P>
<P>"For unto you it is given, in the behalf
of Christ, not only to believe in him, but
also to suffer for his sake, having the same
conflict which ye saw in me, and now
hear to be in me." Phil. ch. i. ver. 29, 30.</P>
<P>"God forbid that I should glory, save in
the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by
whom the world is crucified unto me, and
I unto the world."</P>
<P><PB N="417" REF="421"/>
"From henceforth let no man trouble
me, for I bear in my body the marks of
the Lord Jesus." Gal. ch. vi. ver. 14. 17.</P>
<P>"Ye became followers of us, and of the
Lord, having received the word in much
affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost."
1 Thess. chap. i. ver. 6.</P>
<P>"We ourselves glory in you in the
churches of God for your patience and
faith in all your persecutions and tribula∣tions
that ye endure." 2 Thes. ch. i. ver. 4.</P>
<P>We may seem to have accumulated texts
unnecessarily; but beside that the point,
which they are brought to prove, is of great
importance, there is this also to be remarked
in every one of the passages cited, that the
allusion is drawn from the writer by the
argument or the occasion; that the notice
which is taken of his sufferings, and of the
suffering condition of Christianity, is per∣fectly
incidental, and is dictated by no de∣sign
of stating the facts themselves. Indeed
they are not stated at all: they may rather
be said to be assumed. This is a distinction
upon which we have relied a good deal in
former parts of this treatise; and where the
<PB N="418" REF="422"/>
writer's information cannot be doubted, it
always, in my opinion, adds greatly to the
value and credit of the testimony.</P>
<P>If any reader require from the apostle
more direct and explicit assertions of the
same thing, he will receive full satisfaction
in the following quotations.</P>
<P>"Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak
as a fool) I am more; in labours more
abundant, in stripes above measure, in pri∣sons
more frequent, in deaths oft. Of the
Jews five times received I forty stripes
save one; thrice was I beaten with rods,
once was I stoned; thrice I suffered ship∣wreck,
a night and a day I have been in
the deep; in journeyings often, in perils
of waters, in perils of robbers, in pe∣rils
by mine own countrymen, in perils
by the heathen, in perils in the city, in
perils in the wilderness, in perils in the
sea, in perils among false brethren; in
weariness and painfulness, in watchings
often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings
often, in cold and nakedness." 2 Cor.
chap. xi. ver. 23-28.</P>
<P>Can it be necessary to add more? "I think
<PB N="419" REF="423"/>
that God hath set forth us the apostles
last, as it were appointed to death; for we
are made a spectacle unto the world, and
to angels, and to men.—Even unto this
present hour we both hunger and thirst,
and are naked, and are buffeted, and have
no certain dwelling-place, and labour,
working with our own hands: being re∣viled,
we bless; being persecuted, we suf∣fer
it; being defamed, we entreat: we are
made as the filth of the earth, and are
the off-scouring of all things unto this
day." 1 Cor. chap. iv. ver. 9-13. I sub∣join
this passage to the former, because it
extends to the other apostles of Christianity
much of that which St. Paul declared con∣cerning
himself.</P>
<P>In the following quotations, the reference
to the author's sufferings is accompanied
with a specification of time and place, and
with an appeal for the truth of what he
declares to the knowledge of the persons
whom he addresses: "Even after that we
had suffered before, and were shamefully
entreated, <HI>as ye know, at Philippi,</HI> we were
bold in our God to speak unto you the
<PB N="420" REF="424"/>
gospel of God with much contention."
1 Thess. chap. ii. ver. 2.</P>
<P>"But <HI>thou hast fully known</HI> my doctrine,
manner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffer∣ing,
persecutions, afflictions, which came
to me <HI>at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra</HI>;
what persecutions I endured: but out of
them all the Lord delivered me." 2 Tim.
chap. iii. ver. 10, 11.</P>
<P>I apprehend that to this point, as far as
the testimony of St. Paul is credited, the evi∣dence
from his letters is complete and full.
It appears under every form in which it
could appear, by occasional allusions and by
direct assertions, by general declarations and
by specific examples.</P>
<P N="7">VII. St. Paul in these letters asserts, in posi∣tive
and unequivocal terms, his performance
of miracles strictly and properly so called.</P>
<P>"He therefore that ministereth to you
the spirit, and worketh miracles (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>)
among you, doeth he it by the
works of the law, or by the hearing of
faith?" Gal. chap. iii. ver. 5.</P>
<P>"For I will not dare to speak of those
things which Christ hath not wrought by
<PB N="421" REF="425"/>
me<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>i. e.</HI> "I will speak of nothing but what Christ hath wrought by <HI>me</HI>;" or, as Grotius interprets it, "Christ hath wrought so great things by me, that I will not dare to say what he hath not wrought."</NOTE>, to make the Gentiles obedient, by
word and deed, through mighty signs and
wonders (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>),
by the power of the spirit of God; so that
from Jerusalem and round about unto Il∣lyricum
I have fully preached the gospel
of Christ." Rom. chap. xv. ver. 18, 19.</P>
<P>"Truly the signs of an apostle were
wrought among you in all patience, in
signs and wonders and mighty deeds"
(<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>To these may be added the following indirect allu∣sions, which, though, if they had stood alone, <HI>i. e.</HI> without plainer texts in the same writings, they might have been accounted dubious; yet, when considered in conjunction with the passages already cited, can hardly receive any other interpretation than that which we give them.</P>
<P>"My speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of men's wisdom, but in demonstration of the spirit and of power; that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of man, but of the power of God." 1 Cor. chap. ii. ver. 4, 5.</P>
<P>"The gospel, whereof I was made a minister, ac∣cording to the gift of the grace of God given unto me, by the effectual working of his power." Eph. ch. iii. ver. 7.</P>
<P>"For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me towards the Gentiles." Gal. ch. ii. ver. 8.</P>
<P>"For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance." 1 Thess. chap. i. ver. 5.</P></NOTE>). 2 Cor.
chap. xii. ver. 12.</P>
<P>These words, signs, wonders, and mighty
deeds (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>), are
<PB N="422" REF="426"/>
the specific appropriate terms throughout
the New Testament, employed when public
sensible miracles are intended to be expressed.
This will appear by consulting, amongst other
places, the texts referred to in the note<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mark, xvi. 20. Luke, xxiii. 8. John, ii. 11, 23; iii. 2; iv. 48, 54; xi. 49. Acts, ii. 22; iv. 30; v. 12; vi. 8; vii. 16; xiv. 3; xv. 12. Heb. ii. 4.</NOTE>;
and it cannot be shown that they are ever
employed to express any thing else.</P>
<P>Secondly, these words not only denote
miracles as opposed to natural effects, but
they denote visible, and what may be called
external, miracles, as distinguished,</P>
<P>First, from <HI>inspiration.</HI> If St. Paul had
meant to refer only to secret illuminations
of his understanding, or secret influences
<PB N="423" REF="427"/>
upon his will or affections, he could not,
with truth, have represented them as "signs
and wonders <HI>wrought</HI> by him," of "signs
and wonders and mighty deeds wrought
<HI>amongst</HI> them."</P>
<P>Secondly, from <HI>visions.</HI> These would
not, by any means, satisfy the force of the
terms, "signs, wonders, and mighty deeds;"
still less could they be said to be "<HI>wrought</HI>
by him," or "wrought <HI>amongst</HI> them:"
nor are these terms and expressions any
where applied to visions. When our author
alludes to the supernatural communications
which he had received, either by vision or
otherwise, he uses expressions suited to the
nature of the subject, but very different
from the words which we have quoted. He
calls them revelations, but never signs,
wonders, or mighty deeds. "I will come,"
says he, "to visions and <HI>revelations</HI> of the
Lord;" and then proceeds to describe a
particular instance, and afterwards adds,
"lest I should be exalted above measure
through the abundance of the revelations,
there was given me a thorn in the flesh."</P>
<P>Upon the whole, the matter admits of no
<PB N="424" REF="428"/>
softening qualification, or ambiguity what∣ever.
If St. Paul did not work actual, sen∣sible,
public miracles, he has knowingly, in
these letters, born his testimony to a false∣hood.
I need not add, that, in two also
of the quotations, he has advanced his asser∣tion
in the face of those persons amongst
whom he declares the miracles to have been
wrought.</P>
<P>Let it be remembered that the Acts of the
Apostles describe various particular miracles
wrought by St. Paul, which in their nature
answer to the terms and expressions which
we have seen to be used by St. Paul himself.</P>
<P>Here then we have a man of liberal at∣tainments,
and in other points of sound
judgment, who had addicted his life to the
service of the gospel. We see him, in the
prosecution of his purpose, travelling from
country to country, enduring every species
of hardship, encountering every extremity
of danger, assaulted by the populace, pu∣nished
by the magistrates, scourged, beat,
stoned, left for dead; expecting, whenever

he came, a renewal of the same treatment,
and the same dangers, yet, when driven
from one city, preaching in the next; spend∣ing
his whole time in the employment, sa∣crificing
to it his pleasures, his ease, his
safety; persisting in this course to old age,
unaltered by the experience of perverseness,
ingratitude, prejudice, desertion; unsubdued
by anxiety, want, labour, persecutions; un∣wearied
by long confinement, undismayed
by the prospect of death. Such was St.
Paul. We have his letters in our hands:
we have also a history purporting to be writ∣ten
by one of his fellow-travellers, and ap∣pearing,
by a comparison with these letters,
certainly to have been written by some per∣son
well acquainted with the transactions of
his life. From the letters, as well as from
the history, we gather not only the account
which we have stated of <HI>him,</HI> but that he
was one out of many who acted and suf∣fered
in the same manner; and that, of
those who did so, several had been the com∣panions
of Christ's ministry, the ocular wit∣nesses,
or pretending to be such, of his mi∣racles,
and of his resurrection. We more∣over
<PB N="426" REF="430"/>
find this same person referring in his
letters to his supernatural conversion, the
particulars and accompanying circumstances
of which are related in the history, and
which accompanying circumstances, if all or
any of them be true, render it impossible to
have been a delusion. We also find him po∣sitively,
and in appropriated terms, asserting,
that he himself worked miracles, strictly and
properly so called, in support of the mission
which he executed; the history, meanwhile,
recording various passages of his ministry,
which come up to the extent of this asser∣tion.
The question is, whether falsehood was
ever attested by evidence like this. False∣hoods,
we know, have found their way into
reports, into tradition, into books: but is an
example to be met with, of a man volun∣tarily
undertaking a life of want and pain,
of incessant fatigue, of continual peril; sub∣mitting
to the loss of his home and country,
to stripes and stoning, to tedious imprison∣ment,
and the constant expectation of a
violent death, for the sake of carrying about
a story of what was false, and of what, if
false, he must have known to be so?</P>
