<HEAD>TO THE
COUNT DE BUFFON,
&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU did me honour by permitting me to ad∣dress
to you my Translation of your illu∣strious
work; and I am now proud to exercise the
privilege you so politely conferred upon me. The
important Information it contains, and the Eloquence
of its Composition, joined to the Ingenuity, Taste, and
Erudition with which it every where abounds,
<PB N="ii" REF="4"/>
induced me to think that a Version of it into the
English language, by diffusing the knowledge of
Nature, would increase the number of her ad∣mirers.
The task, it must be acknowledged, was
arduous; but your approbation and encourage∣ment,
by redoubling my vigour, diminished the
difficulty of the labour.</P>
<P>It was with the liveliest pleasure that I re∣ceived
your Communications respecting the valu∣able
Performances you have already published,
and concerning those undertakings which now
engage your attention and cares. I failed not to
announce to your friends in this country the ad∣vantages
which Science and Literature have yet
to expect from you; and I need hardly observe,
that their wishes and my own, for the accom∣plishment
of your purposes, are in proportion to
the greatness of your talents.</P>
<P>The success which the Translation met with,
when published separately in volumes, I imputed
<PB N="iii" REF="5"/>
to the celebrity of your name, and to the high
value of the original; and these causes, I trust,
will justify my anxious attention in laying it be∣fore
the Public in its collected and more perfect
form.</P>
<CLOSER>I have the honour to be,
With the most entire respect,
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>Your most obedient, and
Most humble servant,
WILLIAM SMELLIE.</SIGNED>

<HEAD>PREFACE
BY
THE TRANSLATOR.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<P>NATURAL HISTORY is the most extensive,
and perhaps the most instructive and en∣tertaining
of all the sciences. It is the chief
fource from which human knowledge is deri∣ved.
To recommend the study of it from mo∣tives
of utility, were to affront the understand∣ing
of the reader. Its importance, accordingly,
in the arts of life, and in storing the mind with
just ideas of external objects, as well as of their
relations to the human race, was early percei∣ved
by all nations in their progress from rudeness
to refinement.</P>
<P>But, notwithstanding the great advantages a∣rising
from the knowledge of Nature, Aristotle
is the only antient writer on ZOOLOGY who me∣rits
attention. Instead of retailing fictions, or
facts founded upon ignorance and credulity, he
investigated the relations and discrepances which
connect and distinguish the various tribes of a∣nimals.
<PB N="vi" REF="9"/>
What had been only a chaos of de∣tached,
uncertain, and often fabulous narrations
and descriptions, he reduced into a scientific
form, with a success so amazing, that, to this
hour, no systematic view of animated beings has
been attempted, the principles of which have
not been adopted from Aristotle's history of ani∣mals.
His analogies and distinctions are taken
not only from the instruments of motion, the
teeth, the eyes, the heart, or other external and
internal organs of the body, to which the atten∣tion
of our modern methodists has been chiefly
confined, but from magnitude, figure, manners,
faculties and dispositions of mind. He attempt∣ed
not to arrange and define every known spe∣cies.
This labour he left to men of less geni∣us
and more patience. His work consists entire∣ly
of philosophical dissertations on the gene∣ral
structure, manners, and dispositions of ani∣mals;
and his particular facts are always employ∣ed
to support the principles which he is endea∣vouring
to establish.</P>
<P>Pliny and Aelian, though they had the illu∣strious
example of Aristotle before them, produ∣ced
nothing but crude collections, without dis∣covering
much taste, judgment, or knowledge
of the subject.</P>
<P>From this period, till the voluminous Gesner
and Aldrovandus appeared, the knowledge of
Nature, like other branches of literature, was in∣volved
in the general gloom of ignorance and
superstition. It was the object of these authors
<PB N="vii" REF="10"/>
to amass every thing that had been said of ani∣mals
by poets, shepherds, grammarians, philo∣sophers,
physicians, and old women. Their pro∣lixity,
of course, is insufferable. Their labours,
however, may be regarded as rude quarries,
from which some valuable materials may be dug
up; but the expence of removing the rubbish
will, perhaps, overbalance their intrinsic value.</P>
<P>In the same class, with little exception, may
be ranked, Wotton, Belon, Rondeletius, Salvia∣nus,
Johnson, and a multitude of similar writers.
They all transcribed, and sometimes abridged,
the labours of their predecessors; but they uni∣formly
lost sight of philosophy and science.</P>
<P>This race of phlegmatic writers was suc∣ceeded
by our celebrated countrymen Mr Ray
and Mr Willoughby, who were admirers of
Nature, and lamented the slovenly dress in which
she had been generally exhibited. They
knew the value of her treasures, and wish∣ed
to show them in their native brilliancy.
They rejected dubious and fictious relations.
They added, from observation and experiment,
many new facts: They arranged animals under
proper classes and subdivisions: They described
with accuracy and precision: They pointed out
the importance of the science, and recommended
the study of it by the solidity and clearness of
their views, and by the brevity and perspicuity
of their compositions. This taste continued some
time, and produced the works of Reaumur,
Trembley, Buffon, and similar publications.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="11"/>
From beginnings so prosperous much was to
be expected. But the excellency of method was
no sooner recognised, than the philosophy of the
science was nearly extinguished by a profusion
of new terms and arrangements. The justly ce∣lebrated
Linnaeus, by persevering industry, join∣ed
to the utility of his technical Dictionary<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Systema Naturae, which, with regard to quadrupeds, can be considered in no other light.</NOTE>,
unfortunately turned the attention of most na∣turalists,
though contrary to the learned author's
design, from the great views of Nature to the
humble ambition of system-making. It is need∣less
to specify examples. Every philosopher
must have observed, with regret, that inundation
of methodical distributions which have succes∣sively
appeared during the course of these last
thirty or forty years. Since the publishing of
Linnaeus's works, the attention of Naturalists
has been principally occupied with criticising
former arrangements, and fabricating new ones.
The philosophy of the science has, of course,
been almost totally neglected. It has been ex∣hibited
in its most forbidding aspect, which has
limited the study of it to a few, and those often
not of the most brilliant talents; for it has been
remarked, that the parade of learning, resulting
from technical phrases and definitions, allure
some men to become what is called <HI>great natu∣ralists,</HI>
whose chief knowledge of Nature con∣sists
<PB N="ix" REF="12"/>
in the knack of being able to name, with
facility, a great number of her productions.</P>
<P>This propensity toward multiplying metho∣dical
distributions, and disputing about their re∣spective
merits, has brought much obloquy on
the science of Nature. Men of sense perceive
the folly of discussions concerning the local si∣tuation
of an animal in a book. They consider
the authors as learned triflers; and, what is
worse, they are apt to regard a subject, which
affords no better entertainment or information,
as barren and unprofitable. To no other source
are to be ascribed the following sentiments, so
frequently expressed by men of no inconside∣rable
talents: 'That natural historians have sel∣dom
discovered extensive views; that they
confine their chief attention to the mere tech∣nical
part of the science; that they rarely take
notice of manners and instincts, or the causes
and oeconomy of animal action; and that they
never pursue these great and useful objects
with a degree of taste and philosophical ac∣curacy,
proportioned to the importance of the
subject.' These strictures are common: It were
to be wished that they had no foundation in
truth.</P>
<P>In natural history, two ends only can be at∣tained
by system. Both of them are useful,
but extremely different in their kinds. System
may be employed either to facilitate the distinc∣tion
<PB N="x" REF="13"/>
of objects, or to ascertain their relations in
the scale of being.</P>
<P>The first species of system, it is obvious, must
consist entirely of a series of external or inter∣nal
characters. It is of little moment, whe∣ther
the objects ranked under particular OR∣DERS
be mutually connected; because, if we
may judge from the many laborious, but a∣bortive
attempts which have been made, Na∣ture
seems not to have expressed such con∣nections
in characters recognisable by our senses.
A system so limited in its principles and design,
can never assume any other form than that of a
technical index or dictionary. If the general
and particular characters be so marked, that a
student, after learning the divisions and language
of the author, can investigate the proper names
of the objects presented to him, then is this sy∣stem
perfect; because its sole and primary in∣tention
is fulfilled.</P>
<P>Were every naturalist of the same sentiments
with regard to this point, many incumbrances,
which now load the science, would be removed;
the tyro would not be disgusted and retarded by
an infinity of synonimes; natural history would
acquire a more simple and intelligible form; and
the number of its votaries would soon be aug∣mented.</P>
<P>The second species of system is more elevated
and sublime. But, as it includes the whole phi∣losophy
of Nature, it requires a depth of judg∣ment,
a superiority of genius, an extent of know∣ledge,
<PB N="xi" REF="14"/>
which are seldom united in the same
person. Natural objects are wonderfully diver∣sified
in their structure, oeconomy, and faculties.
But, in these, as well as in many other circum∣stances,
they are no less wonderfully connected.
Here, then, are foundations for constructing the
system of Nature. To mark the distinctions,
to investigate the relations, to ascertain the great
chain that unites the numerous tribes which
people and adorn the universe, would demand
talents superior, perhaps, to those of humanity.
We ought not, however, to despair. Hardly
any bounds can be set to the combined force of
different minds acting successively upon the same
subject. Something has already been done.
More may in time appear: Nature, in some fu∣ture
period, may happily unite Philosophy and
Natural History, a phaenomenon which has hi∣therto
been but partially exhibited.</P>
<P>Among those authors, whether antient or mo∣dern,
who have contributed to unfold the phi∣losophy
of Natural History, the COUNT DE
BUFFON holds the most distinguished rank.
This learned and eloquent writer has introduced
into his subjects a greater variety of disquisition,
and given more comprehensive views of Nature,
than any preceeding or contemporary historian.
His facts are, in general, collected with judg∣ment
and fidelity; and his reasonings and in∣ferences
are not only bold and ingenious, but
adorned with all the beauties of expression, and
<PB N="xii" REF="15"/>
all the charms of novelty. They every where
lead to reflections which are momentous and in∣teresting.
They expand the mind and banish
prejudices. They create an elevation of thought,
and cherish an ardour of inquiry. They open
many great and delightful prospects of the oeco∣nomy
of Nature, of the alterations and acci∣dents
to which she is liable, of the causes of her
improvement or degeneration, and of the gene∣ral
relations that connect the whole, and give
rise to all the diversities which characterise and
constitute particular orders of existence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Notwithstanding the splendid talents of the Count de Buf∣fon, the translator thinks it incumbent upon him to caution the reader against a favourite and dangerous doctrine which the author, in some passages of his work, seems too anxious to incl∣cate. Like many of our modern French writers, he endeavours to banish final causes from the universe. It is a subject of much regret, that philosophers, the persons who are best qualified to unfold the mysteries of Nature, instead of comforting and in∣forming mankind, by showing that her most hostile forms are real expressions of benevolence, and that the great chain of causes and effects, whether in the natural or moral world, are all intended to promote general felicity, should so frequently stretch their fancy for the perverse purpose of throwing a gloom over all her productions, and of excluding design from the ope∣rations of her great Author. Because they cannot comprehend the supreme Being, because they are unable to perceive his mode of acting upon matter, they, therefore, seem willing to disbelieve his existence. They have a partial knowledge of some of the properties of matter. These properties they consider as the only springs which produce and regulate all the movements exhibit∣ed both in animate and inanimate beings; and hence they rash∣ly conclude, that superior powers are unnecessary.—This is not a proper place for reasoning. It shall only be remarked, that a universe without design and intelligence, is more incompre∣hensible than an active machine without a moving principle.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="xiii" REF="16"/>
The original work, of which a translation is
now attempted, was undertaken and carried in∣to
execution under the munificent encourage∣ment
of a great monarch. The design was to
compose a history which should record not only
every phaenomenon in the universe that was al∣ready
known; but to examine, describe, and
delineate from the life, all the animals which
could be procured by royal influence. A plan
so extensive required the joint operation of, at
least, two person; the one to compose the hi∣storical
part, the other to dissect and minutely
describe every animal, both native and foreign,
that should be obtained. The literary character
and philosophic talents of the COUNT DE BUF∣FON
pointed him out for the execution of the
first department, and the acuteness and anato∣mical
skill of M. DAUBENTON, recommended
him for that of the second.</P>
<P>Three volumes of this great work were given
to the public in the year 1749. These volumes
exhibited such displays of learning, taste, genius,
and eloquence, as procured to the author un∣common
admiration, and excited a strong and
general desire for the completion of his plan;
which however, from various causes, was not
accomplished till the year 1767.</P>
<P><PB N="xiv" REF="17"/>
The COUNT DE BUFFON, in the year 1776,
favoured the world with a supplementary vo∣lume
to his history of quadrupeds, which, beside
an ingenious dissertation on Mules, contains re∣lations
and figures of several new animals, and
valuable additions to most of those described in
the original publication.</P>
<P>It would be improper to enter more minutely
into the history or contents of this magnificent
work. Such is the fertility of the author's ge∣nius,
and such his ardour for philosophic inqui∣ry,
that, when treating of the most common a∣nimals,
he often astonishes his reader with the
profoundness of his remarks, and the beauty of
his analogical discussions.</P>
<P>But, though the publication was a great ac∣quisisition
to literature; yet the high price of
SIXTEEN GUINEAS, which was an unavoidable
consequence of its splendour, and of the prodi∣gious
number of its elegant engravings, confined
its utility to men of opulence. Sensible of this
inconvenience, the COUNT DE BUFFON, a few
years ago, published an edition in 12<HI>mo</HI>; and,
to bring it within the reach of common purcha∣sers,
he excluded from it the long and minute
anatomical dissections and mensurations.</P>
<P>After this short sketch of the COUNT DE
BUFFON's History of Nature, it may seem strange
that no decent translation of it has hitherto ap∣peared
in the English language. To such an
undertaking, the great expence of the engravings
<PB N="xv" REF="18"/>
was one solid objection. Another arose from
the vast variety of learning employed by the
author. When to these are added the exube∣rance
of his fancy, the eloquence and force of
his diction, the delicacy and acuteness of his dis∣quisitions,
we should rather wonder how any
man could reconcile himself to a task so labo∣rious,
and which required the union of such di∣versified
talents.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<P>The translation which is now submitted to the
judgment and candour of the public, was projec∣ted
and begun about seven years ago. The tran∣slator,
unsuspicious of rivals, proceeded with de∣liberation.
When the ingenious Dr Goldsmith's
Natural History appeared, some assistance was
expected, as he translates many passages from
Buffon. But this expectation was abortive; for
Dr Goldsmith, though he follows our author in
general, omits and patches according to his own
fancy, seldom giving any article entire, or in or∣der,
and never exerting those talents as a tran∣slator
which he employs so successfully in his o∣riginal
compositions.</P>
<P>Dr Goldsmith's Natural History, however,
suggested to some booksellers the idea of a cheap
translation of Buffon's History of Quadrupeds.
The present translator, knowing the difficulty and
labour of his undertaking, was naturally alarm∣ed
<PB N="xvi" REF="19"/>
when he saw this new publication announced.
But, upon the perusal of it, he was surprised to
find, that, in many places, it was nearly a literal
transcript of the passages which Dr Goldsmith
had tacked together to answer his own views,
without intending to translate, or to exhibit fully
the ideas of Buffon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Translation, vol. 1. p. 65. Goldsmith's Nat. Hist. vol. 2. p. 82. and Buffon, Nat. Hist. vol. 2. p. 521. 4to edit. Who∣ever compares the pages referred to, will find a curious speci∣men of book-manufacture. Dr Goldsmith omits a passage of Buffon's work, and, instead of it, inserts some remarks of his own. The translator copies the whole verbatim, without con∣sulting the original. This is one instance out of many that might be quoted, where the remarks of Dr Goldsmith are gi∣ven to the public as the property of the Count de Buffon. For more examples of the same kind, see Translation, vol. 1. p. 66. Golds. vol. 2. p. 83. Buffon, vol. 2. p. 523. Translation, vol. 2. p. 73. Goldsmith, vol. 2. 102.

are rendered inconclusive; his narrative is
thrown into confusion; and his observations
are rendered incoherent. Above 130 copper∣plates
are also omitted; all those which illustrate
<PB N="xvii" REF="20"/>
the experiments on generation being of this
number. The Translators, besides, as is evident
from a thousand instances, were unacquainted
with the subjects which were treated, and could
not express sentiments which they did not under∣stand<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Take the following examples. The Count de Buffon having conceived the idea, that, by a certain management of animals at birth, the <HI>foramen ovale</HI> of the heart, instead of shutting soon af∣ter respiration, might be kept open for life, instituted a set of experiments to determine the point. Through the whole of these experiments, the <HI>foramen ovale</HI> of the heart is translated the <HI>navel</HI>; and the Count de Buffon is represented by our authors as drawing this strange conclusion: 'This experiment I never car∣ried further; but I saw enough to convince me, that respira∣tion is less necessary to a new born, than to a grown animal; and that it might be possible, with proper precautions, to pre∣vent, in this manner, the NAVEL from being <HI>closed,</HI> and thus produce excellent <HI>divers,</HI> and different kinds of <HI>amphibious</HI> ani∣mals, which might live equally in air and water;' Trans. vol. 1. p. 15.</P>
<P>In vol. 1. p. 40. when enumerating the effects of castration, the translators make Buffon exclaim: 'How great, for example, is the difference between <HI>an</HI> bull and <HI>a</HI> ox, between a <HI>ram</HI> and an <HI>ewe!</HI>'—Speaking of the foetus in utero, vol. 1. p. 165. we have the following passage: 'It possesses then very little oppor∣tunity to exercise the sense of <HI>seeing,</HI> which depends solely on the fineness of the <HI>skin,</HI> and which is <HI>common</HI> to all the body.' In vol. 1. p. 27. where mention is made of the use of the saliva of the mother, in promoting the digestion of the more solid kinds of nourishment taken by infants, Buffon is represented as saying. 'I conceive it [the saliva] to be highly useful, and excellently adapted to their <HI>consideration.</HI>'</P>
<P>'Cows are also subject to <HI>drowsiness</HI> [read <HI>abortion</HI>], if they are put to the plough, and not properly managed;' Trans. vol. 1. p. 454.</P>
<P>'This faculty of <HI>reproduction,</HI> which resides in vegetables and <HI>minerals.</HI> [read <HI>animals</HI>];' Trans. vol. 4. p. 106.</P>
<P>The following passage is good sense in the original.</P>
<P>'But, as we do not perceive these properties purely material, and as they make no impression of themselves, as they <HI>subsist</HI> in our <HI>participotion</HI>; and as, after death, or before life, they exist. and do not at all <HI>affect</HI> us, we cannot say they compose a part of our being; it is, therefore, the organization, the soul, and the life, which properly <HI>constitutes</HI> our existence: Matter, considered in this light, is less the subject than the <HI>accessor</HI>: It is a <HI>foreign expansion,</HI> the <HI>union</HI> of which is unknown, and the <HI>presence</HI> hurt∣ful to us, and this <HI>order</HI> of <HI>thoughts</HI> which constitutes our being, is, very probably, entirely <HI>independent</HI>;' Trans. vol. 4. p. 107.</P>
<P>More examples are unnecessary. The attentive reader will discover similar blunders, proceeding from ignorance of the sub∣jects, in almost every page. The translators have also been un∣lucky in their corrector to the the press; for the book is greatly de∣formed by typographical errors, particularly in the Latin quota∣tions:</P>
<P>E. g. in Translation, vol. 4. p. 294. the following sentence, as printed, is not to be understood: '<HI>Atribus</HI> [A tribus] circiter annis testes <HI>arterio</HI> [arietis], adhuc calentes, ad aedes meas de∣ferri <HI>caraveram</HI> [curaveram]; cum igitur materiam <HI>ed</HI> [ex] e∣pididymibus <HI>eductum</HI> [eductam], ope microscopii contemplarer, non sine ingenti voluptate <HI>advertebum</HI> [advertebam] <HI>animalculae</HI> [animalcula] omnia, quotquot innatabant semini masculino, <HI>eandem</HI> [eundam] natando cursum tenere, ita <HI>nimium</HI> [nimirum] ut quo itinore priora <HI>prenaterunt</HI> [praenatarent] <HI>eadem</HI> [eodem] posteriora subsequerentur, adeo ut hisce animalculis <HI>quasis</HI> [qua∣si] sit ingenitum, quod oves sactitare videmus, scilicet, ut <HI>pre∣cedentium</HI> [praccedentium] vestigiis <HI>que invernos</HI> [grex universus] incedat.'

The style, too, is not only slovenly
<PB N="xviii" REF="21"/>
and inaccurate, but often perfectly unintelligible.
In a word, this translation must be, and actually
is, considered by every intelligent reader, as a
<PB N="xix" REF="22"/>
mere literary imposition. It is painful to mark
the blunders of other men; and, were it not for
a regard to literature, and to the reputation of
the COUNT DE BUFFON, no notice should have
been taken of this strange performance. But
the examples given in the notes will fully justi∣fy
the seeming severity of these strictures.</P>
<P>The following translation comprehends what
is contained in the original fifteen volumes in
quarto, together with the supplementary volume
to the history of quadrupeds, excepting the de∣scription
of the King's cabinet, the dry and un∣interesting
anatomical dissections and mensura∣tions,
which can be of little use but to professed
anatomists, and have been properly omitted by
the author in the last Paris edition. The me∣thod
of studying Natural History; the repre∣hension
of methodical distributions; and the
mode of describing animals, are likewise omitted.
The chief intention of these discourses is to ridi∣cule
the authors of systematic arrangements, and
particularly the late ingenuous and indefatigable
Sir Charles Linnaeus, whose zeal and labours in
promoting the investigation of natural objects
merit the highest applause. There is a stronger
reason for this omission: The same remarks and
arguments are, perhaps, too frequently repeated
in the history of particular animals.</P>
<P>To render this English version more valuable,
the translator has added short distinctive descrip∣tions
to each species of quadrupeds. For these
<PB N="xx" REF="23"/>
he has been indebted to the labours of the learn∣ed
and ingenious Mr Pennant, who has also,
with that politeness, and disinterested regard to
science, which ought always to adorn the gentle∣man
and the scholar, frankly permitted the en∣graving
of several new animals from his excel∣lent
Synopsis<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Synopsis of quadrupeds, by Thomas Pennant, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> 8vo, 1771.</NOTE>. Beside these useful additions,
the synonimes, and the generic and specific cha∣racters
given by Linnacus, Klein, Brisson, and
other naturalists, are subjoined to the descrip∣tion
of each species.</P>
<P>Where the author commits mistakes, or where
he recommends practices, regarding the ma∣nagement
of particular animals, which differ
from those observed in this country, the transla∣tor
has taken the liberty of animadverting upon
such passages in notes: But he has seldom ta∣ken
any notice of peculiar theories or doctrines.
These must rest upon the facts and arguments
employed by the author. It was not the inten∣tion
of the translator to write a commentary upon
his original.</P>
<P>The great variety of subjects discussed by the
Count de Buffon, has already been mentioned.
It is unnecessary to remark, that every subject
demands a peculiar style. A bare enumera∣tion
of facts, or descriptions of the dimensions,
figure, and colour of animals, admit of no other
ornament than that of perspicuity. Topics of
philosophy and argument require a higher and
<PB N="xxi" REF="24"/>
more figurative expression: And addresses to
the passions, and the finer feelings of men, give
full scope to the exercise of genius and taste. Of
these different species of writing, the examples
are numerous in the works of the COUNT DE
BUFFON. The translator has endeavoured to
follow the original, as far as his abilities would
permit. The degree of success he has attained
must be submitted to the impartial determination
of the public. He shall only say, that his ap∣prehensions,
though he is conscious of no vo∣luntary
negligence, are much greater than his
hopes.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="note">
<P> In the dimensions of animals, the tran∣slator
has retained the French measures. The
differences between the foot or inch of England and
France are so inconsiderable, when applied to in∣dividual
animals, that he thought it unnecessary
to reduce them to the precise English standard,
especially as the dimensions are English in the
descriptions added in the notes.</P>

<HEAD>THE
HISTORY AND THEORY
OF THE
EARTH.</HEAD>
<P>THE figure of the earth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See subsequent proofs of the theory of the earth, art. I.</NOTE>, its motions, or
the external relations which subsist be∣tween
it and the other parts of the universe, be∣long
not to our present inquiry. It is the inter∣nal
structure of the globe, its form and manner
of existence, that we here propose to examine.
The general history of the earth ought to precede
that of its productions. Details of particular
facts relating to the oeconomy and manners of
animals, or to the culture and vegetation of
plants, are not, perhaps, so much the objects of
natural history, as general deductions from the
observations that have been made upon the dif∣ferent
materials of which the earth itself is com∣posed;
as its heights, depths, and inequalities;
the motions of the sea, the direction of moun∣tains,
the situation of rocks and quarries, the ra∣pidity
and effects of currents in the ocean, &amp;c.
<PB N="2" REF="27"/>
This is the history of nature at large, and of her
principal operations, by which every other infe∣rior
or less general effect is produced. The the∣ory
of these effects constitutes what may be cal∣led
the primary science, upon which a precise
knowledge of particular appearances, as well as
of terrestrial substances, solely depends. This
species of science may be considered as apper∣taining
to physics; but, is not all physical know∣ledge,
where system is excluded, a part of the
history of nature?</P>
<P>In subjects of an extensive kind, the relations
of which it is difficult to trace, where some
facts are but partially known, and others ob∣scure,
it is more easy to form a fanciful system,
than to establish a rational theory. Thus the
theory of the earth has never hitherto been
treated but in a vague and hypothetical manner.
I shall, therefore, exhibit only a cursory view
of the notions of some authors who have writ∣ten
upon this subject.</P>
<P>The first hypothesis I shall mention is more
conspicuous for its ingenuity than solidity. It
is the production of an English astronomer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whiston; See the proofs, art. II.</NOTE>,
who was an enthusiastic admirer of Sir Isaac
Newton's system of philosophy. Convinced
that every possible event depends upon the mo∣tions
and direction of the stars, he endeavours
to prove, by means of mathematical calculations,
<PB N="3" REF="28"/>
that all the changes this earth has undergone
have been produced by the tail of a comet.</P>
<P>For another hypothesis we are indebted to a
heterodox divine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet. See proofs, art. III.</NOTE>, whose brain was so fully im∣pregnated
with poetical illusions, that he ima∣gined
he had seen the universe created. After
telling us the state of the earth when it first
sprung from nothing, what changes have been
introduced by the deluge, what the earth has been,
and what it now is, he assumes the prophetic
style, and predicts what will be its condition af∣ter
the destruction of the human kind.</P>
<P>A third writer<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Woodward. See proofs, art. IV,</NOTE>, a man of more extensive ob∣servation
than the two former, but equally crude
and confused in his ideas, explains the principal
appearances of the globe by the aid of an im∣mense
abyss in the bowels of the earth; which,
in his estimation, is nothing but a thin crust in∣closing
this vast ocean of fluid matter.</P>
<P>These unstable hypotheses are all constructed
on tottering foundations. The ideas they con∣tain
are indistinct, the facts are confounded, and
the whole is amotely jumble of physics and fa∣ble.
They, accordingly, have never been a∣dopted
but by people who embrace opinions
without examination, and who, incapable of
distinguishing the degrees of probability, are
more deeply impressed with marvellous chime∣ras
than with the force of truth.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="29"/>
Our ideas on this subject will be less extraor∣dinary,
and may appear unimportant when com∣pared
with the grand systems just mentioned.
But it ought not to be forgotten, that it is the
business of an historian to describe, not to in∣vent;
that no gratuitous suppositions are to be
admitted in subjects that depend upon fact and
observation; and that, in historical compositions,
the imagination cannot be employed, unless for
the purpose of combining observations, of ren∣dering
facts more general, and of forming a
connected whole, which presents to the mind
clear ideas, and probable conjectures: I say, pro∣bable;
for it is impossible to give demonstrative
evidence on this subject. Demonstration is con∣fined
to the mathematical sciences. Our know∣ledge
in physics and natural history depends en∣tirely
on experience, and is limited to the me∣thod
of reasoning by induction.</P>
<P>With regard to the history of the earth, there∣fore,
we shall begin with such facts as have been
universally acknowledged in all ages, not omit∣ting
those additional truths that have fallen with∣in
our own observation.</P>
<P>The surface of this immense globe exhibits to
our observation heights, depths, plains, seas,
marshes, rivers, caverns, gulfs, volcano's; and,
on a cursory view, we can discover, in the dis∣position
of these objects, neither order nor re∣gularity.
If we penetrate into the bowels of the
earth, we find metals, minerals, stones, bitumens,
<PB N="5" REF="30"/>
sands, earths, waters, and matter of every kind,
placed as it were by mere accident, and without
any apparent design. Upon a nearer and more
attentive inspection, we discover sunk moun∣tains<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Senec. Quaest. lib. 6. cap. 21. Strab. Geog. lib. 1. Orosius, lib. 2. cap. 18. Plin. lib. 2. cap. 19. Hist. de l'acad, des sciences, année 1708, p. 23.</NOTE>,
caverns filled up, shattered rocks, whole
countries swallowed up, new islands emerged
from the ocean, heavy substances placed above
light ones, hard bodies inclosed within soft bo∣dies;
in a word, we find matter in every form,
dry and humid, warm and cold, solid and brittle,
blended in a chaos of confusion, which can be
compared to nothing but a heap of rubbish, or
the ruins of a world.</P>
<P>These ruins, however, we inhabit with per∣fect
security. The different generations of men,
of animals, and of plants, succeed one another
without interruption: The productions of the
earth are sufficient for their sustenance; the mo∣tions
of the sea, and the currents of the air, are
regulated by fixed laws<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See the proofs, art. XIV.</NOTE>; the returns of the sea∣sons
are uniform, and the rigours of winter in∣variably
give place to the verdure of the spring.
With regard to us, every thing has the appear∣ance
of order: The earth, formerly a chaos, is
now a tranquil, an harmonious, a delightful ha∣bitation,
where all is animated and governed by
such amazing displays of power and intelligence,
<PB N="6" REF="31"/>
as fill us with admiration, and elevate our minds
to the contemplation of the great Creator.</P>
<P>But, let us not decide precipitantly concern∣ing
the irregularities on the surface of the earth,
and the apparent disorder in its bowels: We shall
soon perceive the utility, and even the necessity
of this arrangement. With a little attention,
we shall perhaps discover an order of which we
had no conception, and general relations which
cannot be apprehended by a slight examination.
Our knowledge, indeed, with regard to this sub∣ject,
must always be limited. We are entirely
unacquainted with many parts of the surface of
this globe<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See proofs, art. VI.</NOTE>, and have but very partial ideas con∣cerning
the bottom of the ocean, which, in ma∣ny
places, has never been sounded. We can
only penetrate the rind of the earth. The
greatest caverns<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Phil. trans. abridged, vol. ii. p. 323.</NOTE>, the deepest mines<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Boyle's works, vol. iii. p. 232.</NOTE>, descend
not above the 8th thousandth part of its diame∣ter.
Our judgment is therefore confined to the
upper stratum, or mere superficial part. We
know, indeed, that, bulk for bulk, the earth is
four times heavier than the sun: We likewise
know the proportion its weight bears to that of
the other planets. But still this estimation is
only relative. We have no standard. Of the
real weight of the materials we are so ignorant,
that the internal part of the globe may be either
<PB N="7" REF="32"/>
a void space, or it may be composed of matter
a thousand times heavier than gold. Neither is
there any method of making farther discoveries
on this subject. It is even with difficulty that
rational conjectures can be formed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See proofs, art. I.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>We must therefore confine ourselves to an ac∣curate
examination and description of the surface
of the earth, and of such inconsiderable depths
as we have been able to penetrate. The first
object which attracts the attention, is that im∣mense
body of water with which the greatest
part of the globe is covered. These waters oc∣cupy
the lowest grounds; their surface is always
level; and, notwithstanding their uniform ten∣dency
to equilibrium and rest, they are kept in
perpetual agitation by a powerful agent<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Proofs, art. XII.</NOTE>, which
counteracts their natural tranquility, which com∣municates
to them a regular periodic motion, al∣ternately
elevating and depressing their waves,
and which produces a concussion or vibration
in the whole mass, even to the most profound
depths. This motion of the water is coeval with
time, and will endure as long as the sun and
and moon, which are the causes of it.</P>
<P>In examining the bottom of the sea, we per∣ceive
it to be equally irregular as the surface of
the dry land<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Proofs, art. XIII.</NOTE>. We discover hills and valleys,
plains and hollows, rocks and earths of every
<PB N="8" REF="33"/>
kind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See M. Buache's chart of the depths of the ocean be∣tween Africa and America.</NOTE>: We discover, likewise, that islands are
nothing but the summits of vast mountains,
whose foundations are buried in the ocean<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Varenii Geog. gen. p. 218.</NOTE>;
we find other mountains whose tops are nearly
on a level with the surface of the water; and
rapid currents which run contrary to the gene∣ral
movement<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Proofs, art. XIII.</NOTE>. These currents sometimes run
in the same direction; at other times their mo∣tion
is retrograde<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Varen. p. 140. and Voyages de Pirard, p. 137.</NOTE>; but they never exceed their
natural limits, which seem to be as immutable
as those which bound the efforts of land-rivers.
On one hand, we meet with tempestuous re∣gions,
where the winds blow with irresistible fury,
where the heavens and the ocean, equally convul∣sed,
are mixed and confounded in the general
shock; violent intestine motions, tumultuous swel∣lings<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Shaw's travels.</NOTE>,
water-spouts<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Proofs, art. XVI.</NOTE>, and strange agitations,
produced by volcano's, whose mouths, though
many fathoms below the surface, vomit forth
torrents of fire, and push, even to the clouds,
a thick vapour, composed of water, sulphur,
and bitumen; and dreadful gulphs or whirl∣pools<NOTE N="††" PLACE="foot">The Malestroom in the Norwegian sea.</NOTE>,
which seem to attract vessels for no o∣ther
purpose than to swallow them up. On
the other hand, we discover vast regions of an
<PB N="9" REF="34"/>
opposite nature, always smooth and calm, but
equally dangerous to the mariner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The calms and tornados in the Aethiopian sea.</NOTE>. Here the
winds never exert their force; the nautical art
is of no utility; the becalmed voyagers must re∣main
immoveably fixed, till death relieve them
from misery. To conclude, directing our eyes
toward the southern or northern extremities of
the globe, we discover huge masses of ice<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Proofs, art. VI. and X.</NOTE>,
which, detaching themselves from the polar re∣gions,
advance, like floating mountains, to the
temperate climates, where they dissolve and va∣nish
from our view<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See Buache's chart 1739.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Beside these grand objects, the ocean presents
us with myriads of animated beings, almost in∣finite
in variety: Some clothed in light scales,
swim with amazing swiftness; others, loaded
with thick shells, trail heavily along, leaving
their traces in the sand: To others nature has
given sins resembling wings, with which they
support themselves in the air, and fly before
their enemies to considerable distances. Lastly,
the sea gives birth to other animals, that, totally
deprived of motion, live and die immoveably
fixed to the same rocks: All, however, find a∣bundance
of food in this fluid element. The
bottom of the ocean, and the shelving sides of
rocks, produce plentiful crops of plants of many
different species; its soil is composed of sand,
gravel, rocks, and shells; in some places, it is a fine
clay, in others, a compact earth; and, in gene∣ral,
<PB N="10" REF="35"/>
the bottom of the sea has an exact resem∣blance
to the dry land which we inhabit.</P>
<P>Let us next take a view of the land: What
prodigious differences take place in different
climates? What a variety of soils! what inequa∣lities
in the surface! But, upon a more attentive
observation, we will perceive, that the great
chains of mountains lie nearer the equator than
the poles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Proofs, art. IX.</NOTE>; that, in the Old Continent, their di∣rection
is more from east to west than from
south to north; and that, on the contrary, in
the New Continent, they extend more from north
to south than from east to west. But, what is
still more remarkable, the figure and direction
of these mountains, which have a most irregular
appearance<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. art. IX XII.</NOTE>, correspond so wonderfully, that the
<HI>prominent</HI> angles of one mountain are constant∣ly
opposite to the <HI>concave</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Saliant</HI> and <HI>re entering</HI> angles; Muller's fortification.</NOTE> angles of the neigh∣bouring
mountain<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Lettres Phil. de Bourguet, p. 181.</NOTE>, and of equal dimensions,
whether they be separated by an extensive plain,
or a small valley. I have further remarked, that
opposite hills are always nearly of the same
height; and that mountains generally occupy
the middle of continents, islands, and promon∣tories,
dividing them by their greatest lengths<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Varen, Geog. p. 69.</NOTE>.
I have likewise traced the courses of the princi∣pal
rivers, and find that their direction is near∣ly
perpendicular to the sea-coasts into which
they empty themselves; and that, during the
<PB N="11" REF="36"/>
greatest part of their courses, they follow the
direction of the mountains from which they de∣rive
their origin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Proofs, art X.</NOTE>. The sea-coasts are general∣ly
bordered with rocks of marble, and other hard
stones, or rather with earth and sand accumu∣lated
by the waters of the sea, or brought down
and deposited by rivers. In opposite coasts, sepa∣rated
only by small arms of the sea, the different
strata or beds of earth are of the same materials<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. art. VII.</NOTE>.
I find that volcano's never exist but in high
mountains<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. art. XVI.</NOTE>; that a great number of them
are entirely extinguished; that some are connec∣ted
to others by subterranean passages, and their
eruptions not unfrequently happen at the same
time<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Kircher Mund. subter. in praes.</NOTE>. There are similar communications be∣tween
certain lakes and seas. Some rivers sud∣denly
disappear<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Varen. Geog. p. 43.</NOTE>, and seem to precipitate them∣selves
into the bowels of the earth. We likewise
find certain mediterranean or inland seas, that con∣stantly
receive, from many and great rivers, pro∣digious
quantities of water, without any aug∣mentation
of their bounds, probably discharging
by subterraneous passages all those extraneous
supplies. It is likewise easy to distinguish lands
which have been long inhabited, from those new
countries where the earth appears in a rude state,
where the rivers are full of cataracts, where the
land is either nearly overflowed with water, or
burnt up with drought, and where every place
<PB N="12" REF="37"/>
capable of producing trees is totally covered with
wood.</P>
<P>Proceeding in our examination, we discover
that the upper stratum of the earth is universal∣ly
the same substance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Proofs, art. VII.</NOTE>; that this substance,
from which all animals and vegetables derive
their growth and nourishment, is nothing but
a composition of the decayed parts of animal
and vegetable bodies, reduced into such small
particles that their former organic state is not
distinguishable. Penetrating a little deeper, we
find the real earth, beds of sand, lime-stone, clay,
shells, marble, gravel, chalk, &amp;c. These beds
are always parallel to each other<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. and Woodward, p. 41. &amp;c.</NOTE>, and of the
same thickness through their whole extent. In
neighbouring hills, beds or strata of the same
materials are uniformly found at the same le∣vels,
though the hills be separated by deep and
large valleys. Strata of every kind, even of the
most solid rocks, are uniformly divided by per∣pendicular
fissures<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Proofs, art. VIII.</NOTE>. Shells, skeletons of fishes,
marine plants, &amp;c. are often found in the bowels
of the earth, and on the top of mountains<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Proofs, art. VIII.</NOTE>, even
at the greatest distances from the sea. These
shells, fishes, and plants, are exactly similar to
those which exist in the ocean. Petrified shells
are to be met with, almost every wher, in
prodigious quantities: They are not only in∣closed
in rocks of marble and lime-stone, as
<PB N="13" REF="38"/>
well as in earths and clays, but are actually in∣corporated
and filled with the very substances
in which they are inclosed. In fine, I am con∣vinced,
by repeated observation, that marbles,
lime-stones, chalks, marles, clays, sand, and al∣most
all terrestrial substances, wherever situa∣ted,
are full of shells and other spoils of the
ocean<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Steno, Woodward, Ray, Bourguet, Scheuchzer, Phil. Trans. Mem. de I'Acad. &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Having enumerated these facts, let us try
what conclusions can be drawn from them.</P>
<P>The changes which the earth has undergone,
during the last two or three thousand years,
are inconsiderable, when compared with the
great revolutions which must have taken place
in those ages that immediately succeeded the
creation. For, as terrestrial substances could
not acquire solidity but by the continued action
of gravity, it is easy to demonstrate, that the
surface of the earth was at first much softer than
it is now; and, consequently, that the same
causes which at present produce but slight, and
almost imperceptible alterations during the course
of many centuries, were then capable of produ∣cing
very great revolutions in a few years. It
appears, indeed, to be an uncontravertible fact,
that the dry land which we now inhabit, and
even the summits of the highest mountains,
were formerly covered with the waters of the
sea; for shells, and other marine bodies, are
<PB N="14" REF="39"/>
still found upon the very tops of mountains. It
likewise appears, that the waters of the sea have
remained for a long track of years upon the sur∣face
of the earth; because, in many places, such
immense banks of shells have been discovered,
that it is impossible so great a multitude of ani∣mals
could exist at the same time. This circum∣stance
seems likewise to prove, that, although
the materials on the surface of the earth were
then soft, and, of course, easily disunited,
moved, and transported, by the waters; yet
these transportations could not be suddenly ef∣fected.
They must have been gradual and suc∣cessive,
as sea-bodies are sometimes found
more than 1000 feet below the surface. Such
a thickness of earth or of stone could not be ac∣cumulated
in a short time. Although it should
be supposed, that, at the deluge, all the shells
were transported from the bottom of the ocean,
and deposited upon the dry land; yet, beside the
difficulty of establishing this supposition, it is
clear, that, as shells are found incorporated in
marble, and in the rocks of the highest moun∣tains,
we must likewise suppose, that all these
marbles and rocks were formed at the same
time, and at the very instant when the deluge
took place; and that, before this grand revolu∣tion,
there were neither mountains, nor marbles,
nor rocks, nor clays, nor matter of any kind si∣milar
to what we are now acquainted with,
as they all, with few exceptions, contain shells,
<PB N="15" REF="40"/>
and other productions of the ocean. Beside, at
the time of the universal deluge, the earth must
have acquired a considerable degree of solidity,
by the action of gravity for more than sixteen
centuries. During the short time the deluge
lasted, it is, therefore, impossible, that the waters
should have overturned and dissolved the whole
surface of the earth, to the greatest depths that
mankind have been able to penetrate.</P>
<P>But, without insisting longer on this point,
which shall afterwards be more fully canvassed,
I shall confine myself to known and established
facts. It is certain, that the waters of the sea
have, at some period or other, remained for a
succession of ages upon what we now know to
be dry land; and, consequently, that the vast
continents of Asia, Europe, Africa, and Ameri∣ca,
were then the bottom of an immense ocean,
replete with every thing which the present ocean
produces. It is likewise certain, that the diffe∣rent
strata of the earth are horizontal, and pa∣rallel
to each other<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Proofs, art. VII.</NOTE>. This parallel situation
must, therefore, be owing to the operation of
the waters, which have gradually accumulated
the different materials, and given them the same
position which water itself invariably assumes.
The horizontal position of strata is almost uni∣versal:
In plains, the strata are exactly horizon∣tal.
It is only in the mountains that they are
inclined to the horizon; because they have ori∣ginally
<PB N="16" REF="41"/>
been formed by sediments deposited up∣on
an inclined base. Now, I maintain, that these
strata must have been gradually formed, and are
not the effect of any sudden revolution; because
nothing is more frequent than strata composed
of heavy materials placed above light ones,
which never could have happened, if, according
to some authors, the whole had been blended
and dissolved by the deluge, and afterwards pre∣cipitated.
On this supposition, every thing
would have had a different aspect from what
now appears. The heaviest bodies would
have descended first, and every stratum would
have had a situation corresponding to its specific
gravity. In this case, we should not have seen
solid rocks or metals placed above light sand,
nor clay under coal.</P>
<P>Another circumstance demands our attention.
No other cause than the motion and sediments
or water could possibly produce the regular po∣sition
of the various strata of which the superfi∣cial
part of this earth is composed. The highest
mountains consist of parallel strata, as well as
the lowest valleys. Of course, the formation of
mountains cannot be imputed to the shocks of
earthquakes, or to the eruptions of volcano's.
Such small eminences as have been raised by
volcano's or convulsions of the earth, instead of
being composed of parallel strata, are mere mas∣ses
of weighty material, blended together in the
<PB N="17" REF="42"/>
utmost confusion.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Proofs, art. XVII.</NOTE>. But this parallel and hori∣zontal
position of strata must necessarily be the
operation of a uniform and constant cause.</P>
<P>We are, therefore, obliged to conclude, from
repeated and uncontrovertible facts and obser∣vations,
that the dry and habitable part of the
earth has remained for a long time under the
waters of the sea, and must have undergone the
same fluctuation and changes which are present∣ly
going on at the bottom of the ocean. To
discover, therefore, what has formerly happen∣ed
to the dry land, let us examine what passes
in the bottom of the sea; and we shall soon be
enabled to make some rational conclusions with
regard to the external figure, and internal con∣stitution
of the earth.</P>
<P>The ocean, from the creation of the solar sy∣stem,
has been constantly subject to a regular
flux and reflux. This motion, which happens
twice in twenty-four hours, is principally occa∣sioned
by the action of the moon, and is greater
in the equatorial regions than in other climates.
The earth likewise performs a rapid motion on
its axis, and, consequently, has a centrifugal
force, which is also greatest at the equator.
This last circumstance, independent of actual
observations, proves, that the earth is not a per∣fect
sphere, but that it must be more elevated
under the equator than at the poles. From these
two combined causes, the tides, and the motion
<PB N="18" REF="43"/>
of the earth, it may be fairly concluded, that, al∣though
this globe had been originally a perfect
sphere, its diurnal motion, and the ebbing and
flowing of the tides, must necessarily, in a suc∣cession
of time, have elevated the equatorial
parts, by gradually carrying mud, earth, sand,
shells, &amp;c. from other climates, and depositing
them at the equator<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Proofs, art. XII.</NOTE>. On this supposition, the
greatest inequalities on the surface of the earth
ought to be found, and, in fact, are found, in
the neighbourhood of the equator. Besides, as
the alternate motion of the tides has been con∣stant
and regular since the existence of the
world, is it not natural to think, that, at each
tide, the water carries from one place to ano∣ther
a small quantity of matter, which falls to
the bottom as a sediment, and forms those hori∣zontal
and parallel strata that every where ap∣pear?
The motion of the waters, in the flux
and reflux, being always horizontal, the matter
transported by them must necessarily take the
same parallel direction after it is deposited.</P>
<P>To this, it may be objected, that, as the flux
is equal to, and regularly succeeded by the re∣flux,
the two motions will blance each other;
or, that the matter brought by the flux will be
carried back by the reflux; and, consequently,
that this cause of the formation of strata must
be chimerical, as the bottom of the ocean can
never be affected by a uniform alternate motion
<PB N="19" REF="44"/>
of the waters; far less could this motion change
its original structure, by creating heights, and
other inequalities.</P>
<P>But, in the first place, the alternate motion of
the waters is by no means equal; for the sea
has a continual motion from east to west: Be∣side,
the agitations occasioned by the winds, pro∣duce
great inequalities in the tides. It will like∣wise
be acknowledged, that, by every motion
in the sea, particles of earth, and other mate∣rials,
must be carried from one place, and de∣posited
in another; and that these collections
of matter must assume the form of parallel and
horizontal strata. Farther, a well known fact
will entirely obviate this objection. On all
coasts, where the ebbing and flowing are dis∣cernible<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Proofs, art. XIX.</NOTE>, numberless materials are brought in
by the flux, which are not carried back by the
reflux. The sea gradually increases on some
places, and recedes from others, narrowing its
limits, by depositing earth, sand, shells, &amp;c.
which naturally take a horizontal position.
These materials, when accumulated and eleva∣ted
to a certain degree, gradually shut out the
water, and remain for ever in the form of dry
land.</P>
<P>But, to remove every doubt concerning this
important point, let us examine more closely
the practicability of a mountain's being formed
at the bottom of the sea, by the motion and se∣diments
<PB N="20" REF="45"/>
of the water. On a coast which the
sea washes with violence during the flow, some
part of the earth must be carried off by every
stroke of the waves. Even where the sea is
bounded by rock, it is a known fact, that the
rock is gradually wasted by the water<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Shaw's travels.</NOTE>; and,
consequently, that small particles are carried off
by the retreat of every wave. Those particles
of earth or stone are necessarily transported to
some distance. Whenever the agitation of the
water is abated, the particles are precipitated in
the form of a sediment, and lay the foundation
of a first stratum, which is either horizontal, or
inclined, according to the situation of the sur∣face
upon which they fall. This stratum will
soon be succeeded by a similar one, produced
by the same cause; and thus a considerable
quantity of matter will be gradually amassed,
and disposed in parallel beds. In process of
time, this gradually accumulating mass will be∣come
a mountain in the bottom of the sea, ex∣actly
resembling, both in external and internal
structure, these mountains which we see on the
dry land. If there happened to be shells in
that part of the bottom of the sea where we
have supposed the sediments to be deposited,
they will be covered, filled, and incorporated
with the deposited matter, and form a part of
the general mass. These shells will be lodged
in different parts of the mountains, correspon∣ding
<PB N="21" REF="46"/>
to the times they were deposited. Those
which lay at the bottom, before the first stratum
was formed, will occupy the lowest station;
and those which were afterwards deposited, will
be found in the more elevated parts.</P>
<P>In the same manner, when the bottom of the
sea, at particular places, is troubled by the agi∣tation
of the water, earth, clay, shells, and other
matter, must necessarily be removed from these
parts, and deposited elsewhere. For we are as∣sured
by all divers, that the bottom of the sea,
at the greatest depths to which they descend<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Boyle's works, vol. 3. p. 232.</NOTE>,
is so strongly affected by the agitation of the
water, that earth, clay, and shells, are removed
to great distances. Transportations of this kind
must, therefore, be constantly going on in every
part of the ocean; and the matters transported,
after subsiding, must uniformly raise eminences
similar, in every respect, to the composition and
structure of our mountains. Thus the motions
produced by the flux and reflux, by winds and
currents, must uniformly create inequalities in
the bottom of the ocean.</P>
<P>Further, we must not imagine that these
matters cannot be carried to great distances,
since we daily find grain, and other productions
of the East and West Indies, arriving on our
coasts<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Particularly on the coasts of Scotland and of Ireland; See Ray's Discourses.</NOTE> These bodies are, indeed, specifically
lighter than water; but the other substances
<PB N="22" REF="47"/>
are specifically heavier. Still, however, as they
are reduced to an impalpable powder, they may
be kept long suspended in the water, and, of
course, transported to any distance.</P>
<P>It has been conceived, that the agitation pro∣duced
by the winds and tides is only superficial,
and does not affect the bottom, especially when
it is very deep. But it ought to be remember∣ed,
that, whatever be the depth, the whole mass
is put in motion by the tides at the same time;
and that, in a fluid globe, this motion would be
communicated even to the centre. The power
which occasions the flux and reflux is penetra∣ting;
it acts equally upon every particle of the
mass; so that the quantity of its force, at diffe∣rent
depths, may be determined by calculation.
Indeed, this point is so certain, that it admits
not of dispute.</P>
<P>We cannot, therefore, hesitate in pronouncing,
that the tides, the winds, and every other cause
of motion in the sea, must produce heights and
inequalities in its bottom; and that these emi∣nences
must uniformly be composed of regular
strata, either horizontal or inclined. These
heights will gradually augment; like the waves
which formed them, they will mutually respect
each other; and, if the extent of the base be
great, in a track of years, they will form a vast
chain of mountains. Whenever eminences are
formed, they interrupt the uniform motion of
the waters, and produce new motions, known
<PB N="23" REF="48"/>
by the name of currents. Between two neigh∣bouring
heights in the bottom of the ocean,
there must be a current<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Proofs, art. XIII.</NOTE>, which will follow
their common direction, and, like a river, cut a
channel, the angles of which will be alternately
opposite through the whole extent of its course.
These heights must continually increase; for,
during the flow, the water will deposite its or∣dinary
sediment upon their ridges, and the wa∣ters
which are impelled by the current will force
along, from great distances, quantities of matter,
which will subside between the hills, and, at the
same time, scoup out a valley with corresponding
angles at their foundation. Now, by means of
these different motions and sediments, the bot∣tom
of the ocean, though formerly smooth,
must soon be furrowed, and interspersed with
hills and chains of mountains, as we actually
find it at present. The soft materials of which
the eminences were originally composed, would
gradually harden by their own gravity. Such
of them as consisted of sandy and crystalline
particles, would produce those enormous masses
of rock and flint in which we find crystals and
other precious stones. Others, composed of sto∣ny
particles mixed with shells, give rise to those
beds of lime-stone and marble, in which vast
quantities of sea-shells are still found incorpora∣ted.
Lastly, all our beds of marle and chalk have
derived their origin from particles of shells mix∣ed
<PB N="24" REF="49"/>
with a pure earth, collected and deposited at
particular places in the bottom of the sea. All
these substances are disposed in regular strata;
they all contain heterogenous matter, and vast
quantities of sea-bodies situated nearly in pro∣portion
to their specific gravities. The lighter
shells are found in chalk; the heavier in clay
and lime-stone. These shells are uniformly fill∣ed
with the matter in which they are found,
whether it be stone or earth; an incontestible
proof, that they have been transported along
with the matter which fills and surrounds them,
and that this matter was then in the form of an
impalpable powder. In a word, all those sub∣stances,
the horizontal situation of which has a∣risen
from the waters of the sea, invariably pre∣serve
their original position.</P>
<P>It may here be objected, that most hills whose
summits consist rocks of moor-stone, or
of marble, are founded upon small eminences,
composed of less heavy materials, of clay, for ex∣ample,
or of light sand, the strata of which com∣monly
extend over the neighbouring plains. If
the above theory be just, what could bring a∣bout
an arrangement so singular, so contrary to
the laws of gravity? But this phaenomenon ad∣mits
of an easy and natural explication. The
waters would operate first upon the upper stra∣tum,
either of coasts, or the bottom of the sea:
This upper stratum consists generally of clay or
sand; and these light substances, being carried
<PB N="25" REF="50"/>
off and deposited previous to the more dense and
solid, they would of course from small eminen∣ces,
and become foundations for the more hea∣vy
particle to rest upon. After the light super∣ficial
substances are removed, the harder and
more ponderous would next be subjected to the
attrition of the water, reduced to a fine powder,
and carried off and deposited above the hillocks of
sand or clay. These small stony particles would,
in a succession of ages, form those solid rocks
which we now find on the tops of hills and
mountains. As particles of stone are heavier
than sand or clay, it is probable that they were
originally covered and pressed by superior stra∣ta
of considerable depth; but that they now oc∣cupy
the highest stations, because they were last
transported by the waves.</P>
<P>To confirm this reasoning, let us investigate
more minutely the situation of those materials
which compose the superficial part of the globe,
the only part of which we have any adequate
knowledge. The different strata of stones in
quarries are almost all horizontal or regualrly in∣clined.
Those founded upon hard clay, or o∣ther
solid matter, are evidently horizontal, e∣specially
in plains. The disposition of quarries,
where flint or brownish free-stone are found in
detached portions, is indeed less regular. But
even here the uniformity of nature is not inter∣rupted;
for the horizontal or regularly inclining
position of the strata is apparent in granite and
<PB N="26" REF="51"/>
brown free-stone, wherever they exist in large
connected masses. This position is universal,
excepting in flint and brown free-stone in small
detached portions, substances, the formation of
which we shall demonstrate to have been posterior
to those just now mentioned. The strata of gra∣nite,
vitrifiable sand, clays, marbles, calcareous
stones, chalk, and marles, are always parallel or
equally inclined. In these the original forma∣tion
is easily discoverable; for the strata are ex∣actly
horizontal, and very thin, being placed a∣bove
each other like the leaves of a book. Beds
of sand, of soft and hard clay, of chalk, and of
shells, are likewise either horizontal or uniform∣ly
inclined. Strata of every kind preserve the
same thickness through their whole extent, which
is often many leagues, and might, by proper
observations, be traced still farther. In a word,
the disposition of strata, as deep as mankind have
hitherto penetrated, is the same.</P>
<P>Those beds of sand and gravel which are
washed down from mountains must, in some
measure, be excepted from the general rule.
They are sometimes of a considerable extent in
valleys, and are situated immediately under the
soil, or first stratum. In plains, they are level,
like the more antient and interior strata. But
near the bottom, or upon the ridges of hills,
they have an inclination corresponding to that
of the ground upon which they have been de∣posited.
As these beds of sand and gravel are
<PB N="27" REF="52"/>
formed by rivers and brooks, which, especially
in the valleys, often change their channels, it is
not surprising that they should be so frequent.
A small rivulet is sufficient, in a course of time,
to spread a bed of sand or gravel over a very
large valley. In a champaign country, surround∣ed
with hills, whose base, as well as the upper
stratum of the plain, consisted of a hard clay, I
have often observed, that, above the origin of
the brooks or rivers, the clay was situated imme∣diately
under the vegetable stratum; but, in the
low grounds, there was a stratum of sand, about
a foot thick above the clay, extending to a great
distance from the banks of the rivers. The strata
formed by rivers are not very antient; they
are easily distinguished by their frequent inter∣ruptions,
and the inequality in thickness, which
is constantly varying; but the antient strata
uniformly preserve the same dimensions through
their whole extent. Besides, these modern strata
may be distinguished, with certainty, by the
form of the stones and gravel they contain,
which bear evident marks of having been roll∣ed,
smoothed, and rounded by the motion of
water. The same observation may be made with
regard to those beds of turf, and corrupted ve∣getables,
which are found in marshy grounds,
immediately below the soil: They have no claim
to antiquity, but have derived their existence
from successive accumulations of decayed trees,
and other plants. The strata of slime, or mud,
<PB N="28" REF="53"/>
which occur in many places, are also recent pro∣ductions,
having been formed by stagnating wa∣ters,
or the inundations of rivers. They are not
so exactly horizontal, or so uniformly inclined,
as the more antient strata, produced by the re∣gular
motions of the sea. In strata formed by
rivers, we meet with river, but seldom with sea
shells; and the few that occur are broken, de∣tached,
and placed without order. But, in the
antient strata, there are no river-shells; the sea∣shells
are numerous, well preserved, and all pla∣ced
in the same manner, having been transport∣ed
and deposited at the same time, and by the
same cause. From whence could this beautiful
regularity proceed? Instead of regular strata,
why do we not find the matters composing the
earth huddled together without order? Why are
not rocks, marbles, clays, marles, &amp;c. scattered
promiscuously, or joined by irregular or vertical
strata? Why are not heavy bodies uniformly
found in a lower situation than light ones? It is
easy to perceive, that this uniformity of nature,
this species of organization, this union of diffe∣rent
materials by parallel strata, without regard
to their weights, could only proceed from a
cause equally powerful and uniform as the mo∣tions
of the sea, produced by regular winds, or
by the flux and reflux, &amp;c.</P>
<P>These causes act with superior force under
the equator than in other climates; for there
the tides are higher, and the winds more uni∣form.
<PB N="29" REF="54"/>
The most extensive chains of mountains
are likewise in the neighbourhood of the equa∣tor.
The mountains of Africa and Peru are the
highest in the world, often extending through
whole continents, and stretching to great distan∣ces
under the waters of the ocean. The moun∣tain
of Europe and Asia, which extend from
Spain to China, are not so elevated as those of
Africa and South America. According to the
relations of voyagers, the mountains of the north
are but small hills, when compared to the moun∣tains
of the equatorial regions. Besides, in the
northern seas, there are few islands; but, in the
Torrid Zone, they are innumerable. Now, as
islands are only the summits of mountains, it is
apparent, that there are more inequalities on the
surface of the earth, near the equator, than in
northerly climates.</P>
<P>Those prodigious chains of mountains which
run from west to east in the Old Continent, and
from north to south in the New, must have been
formed by the general motion of the tides. But
the origin of the less considerable mountains
and hills, must be ascribed to particular mo∣tions,
occasioned by winds, currents, and other
irregular agitations of the sea: Their formation
may, indeed, be owing to a combination of all
those motions, which are capable of infinite va∣riations;
for the winds, and the situation of
different islands and coasts, constantly change
the natural course of the tides, making them
<PB N="30" REF="55"/>
run in every possible direction. It is, therefore,
by no means surprising to see considrable
eminences having no determined direction in
their courses. But, for our present purpose, it
is sufficient to have shown, that mountains have
not been produced by earthquakes, or other ac∣cidental
causes, but that they are effects equally
resulting from the general laws of nature, as
their peculiar structure, and the situation of the
materials of which they are composed.</P>
<P>But how has it happened, that this earth,
which we and our ancestors have inhabited for
ages, which, from time immemorial, has been
an immense continent, dry, compact, and re∣moved
from the reach of the water, should, if
formerly the bottom of an ocean, be now ex∣alted
to such a height above the waters, and so
compleatly separated from them? Since the wa∣ters
remaiend so long upon the earth, why have
they now deserted it? What accident, what
cause, could introduce a change so great? Is it
even possible to conceive a cause possessed of
power sufficient to operate such an amazing ef∣fect?</P>
<P>These are difficult questions. But, as the
facts are uncontrovertible, the precise manner
in which they have happened may remain a se∣cret,
without prejudice to the conclusions which
ought to be drawn from them. A little re∣flection,
however, will furnish us at least with
<PB N="31" REF="56"/>
plausible solutions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See proofs, art. XIX.</NOTE>. We daily observe the sea
gaining ground on certain coasts, and losing it
on others. We know, that the ocean has a ge∣neral
and uniform motion from east to west;
that it makes violent efforts against the rocks
and low grounds which encircle it; that there
are whole provinces which human industry can
hardly defend from the fury of the waves; and
that there are instances of islands which have
but lately emerged from the waters, and of re∣gular
inundations. History informs us of in∣undations
and deluges of a more extensive na∣ture.
Ought not all this to convince us, that
the surface of the earth has experienced very
great revolutions, and that the sea may have ac∣tually
given up possession of the greatest part of
the ground which it formerly occupied? For
example, let us suppose, that the Old and New
worlds were formerly but one continent, and
that, by a violent earthquake, the antient Ata∣lantis
of Plato was sunk. What would be the
consequence of such a mighty revolution? The
sea would necessarily rush in from all quarters,
and form what is now called the Atlantic Ocean;
and vast continents, perhaps those which we
now inhabit, would, of course, be left dry. This
great revolution might be effected by the sudden
failure of some immense cavern in the interior
part of the globe, and an universal deluge would
infallibly succeed. I would rather incline to
<PB N="32" REF="57"/>
think, that such a revolution would not be sud∣denly
accomplished, but that it required a very
long period. However these conjectures stand,
it is certain, that the revolution has happened,
and I even believe that it happened naturally;
for, if a judgment of the future is to be formed
from the past, we have only to attend carefully
to what daily passes before our eyes. It is a
fact, established by the repeated observation of
voyagers, that the ocean has a constant motion
from east to west. This motion, like the trade∣winds,
is not only perceived between the
tropics, but through the whole temperate cli∣mates,
and as near the poles as navigators have
approached. As a necessary consequence of this
motion, the Pacific Ocean must make continual
efforts against the coasts of Tartary, China, and
India; the Indian Ocean must act against the
east coast of Africa; and the Atlantic must act
in a similar manner against all the eastern coasts
of America. Hence the sea must have gained,
and will always continue to gain on the east, and
to lose on the west. This of itself would be suf∣ficient
to prove the possibility of the change of
sea into land, and of land into sea. If such is
the natural effect of the sea's motion from east
to west, may it not reasonably be supposed, that
Asia, and all the eastern continent, is the most
antient country in the world? and that Europe,
and part of Africa, especially the west parts of
these continents, as Britain, France, Spain, &amp;c.
<PB N="33" REF="58"/>
are countries of a more recent date? Both histo∣ry
and physics concur in establishing this hypo∣thesis.</P>
<P>But, besides the constant motion of the sea
from east to west, other causes concur in produ∣cing
the effect just mentioned. There are many
lands lower than the level of the sea, and de∣fended
only by a narrow isthmus of rock, or by
banks of still weaker materials. The action of
the waters must gradually destroy these barriers,
and, consequently, such lands must then become
part of the ocean. Besides, the mountains are
daily diminishing, part of them being constantly
carried down to the valleys by rains. It is like∣wise
well known, that every little brooke carries
earth, and other matters, from the high grounds
into the rivers, by which they are at last trans∣ported
to the ocean. By these means, the bot∣tom
of the sea is gradually filling up, the sur∣face
of the earth is approaching to a level, and
nothing but time is wanting for the sea's succes∣sively
changing places with the land.</P>
<P>I speak not here of causes removed beyond
the sphere of our knowledge, of those convul∣sions
of nature, the slightest throe of which
would be fatal to the globe. The near approach
of a comet, the absence of the moon, or the in∣troduction
of a new planet into the system, &amp;c.
are suppositions upon which the imagination
may rove at large. Causes of this kind will
produce any effect we chuse. From a single hy∣pothesis
<PB N="34" REF="59"/>
of this nature, a thousand physical ro∣mances
might be drawn, and their authors might
dignify them with the title of <HI>Theory of the
Earth.</HI> As an historian, I reject these vain spe∣culations:
They depend upon mere possibilities,
which, if called into action, necessarily imply
such a devastation in the universe, that our
globe, like a fugitive particle of matter, escapes
our observation, and is no longer worthy of our
attention. But, to give consistency to our ideas,
we must take the earth as it is, examine its dif∣ferent
parts with minuteness, and, by induction,
judge of the future, from what at present exists.
We ought not to be affected by causes which
seldom act, and whose action is always sudden
and violent. These have no place in the ordi∣nary
course of nature. But operations uniform∣ly
repeated, motions which succeed one another
without interruption, are the causes which alone
ought to be the foundation of our reasoning.</P>
<P>Some examples shall be given: We shall com∣bine
particular effects with general causes, and
give a detail of facts, which will illustrate and
explain the different alterations that the earth
has undergone, whether by irruptions of the sea
upon the land, or by the sea's retiring from
lands which it formerly covered.</P>
<P>That irruption which gave rise to the Medi∣terranean<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Proofs. art. XI. and XIX. p. 209.; Plot. Hist. Nat. &amp;c.</NOTE>,
is undoubtedly the greatest<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ray's Discourses,</NOTE>. The
<PB N="35" REF="60"/>
ocean runs with prodigious rapidity through a
narrow passage between two promontories<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phil. Trans. abridged, vol. 2. p. 289. Siculus, Strabo.</NOTE>, and
then forms a vast sea, which, exclusive of the
Black Sea, is about seven times larger than the
kingdom of France. The motion through the
Straits of Gibraltar is contrary to the motion in
every other strait. The general motion of the
sea is from east to west; but, in the Straits of
Gibraltar, it is from west to east: An incontes∣tible
proof, that the Mediterranean Sea is not an
antient gulf, but that it has been formed by an
irruption, produced by some accidental cause,
such as an earthquake swallowing up the bar∣rier,
or a violent effort of the ocean, occasioned
by the wind's forcing its way through the bank,
between the two promotories of Gibraltar and
Ceuta. This opinion is supported by the testi∣mony
of the antients<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Diodorus</NOTE>, who inform us, that
there was a time when the Mediterranean had
no existence. It is likewise confirmed by na∣tural
history, and by observations upon the strata
in the opposite coasts of Africa and Spain,
where, as in neighbouring mountains, the beds
of earth and stone are precisely the same at the
same levels.</P>
<P>When the ocean forced this passage, it ran
through the Straits with much more rapidity
than at present, and instantly deluged that large
tract of land which formerly jointed Europe to
<PB N="36" REF="61"/>
Africa. The waters covered all the grounds
which were lower than the level of the ocean;
and no part of them is now to be seen, except
the tops of some of the mountains, such as part
of Italy, Sicily, Malta, Corsica, Sardinia, Cy∣prus,
Rhodes, and the islands of the Archipe∣lago.</P>
<P>I have not mentioned the Black Sea as an ef∣fect
of this irruption; because the quantity of
water it receives from the Danube, the Nieper,
the Don, and other rivers, is more than suffi∣cient
both to form and support it. Besides, it
runs with great rapidity through the Bosphorus
into the Mediterranean<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phil. Trans abridged, vol. 2. p. 289.</NOTE>. It may even be sup∣posed,
that the Black and Caspian Seas were on∣ly
two large lakes, which were perhaps joined
by a narrow communication, or rather by a mo∣rass,
or small lake, uniting the Don and the
Wolga about Tria, where these two rivers run
very near each other. It is likewise probable,
that these two seas, or lakes, were formerly of
a much greater extent; for the large rivers
which fall into the Black and Caspian Seas must
have gradually brought down a quantity of earth
and sand sufficient to stop up the communication,
and to form that neck of land by which these
two seas are divided. We know, that large ri∣vers,
in a course of time, block up seas, and form
new lands, as in the province at the mouth of
the Yellow river in China; Louisiana at the
<PB N="37" REF="62"/>
mouth of the Missisippi; and the northern part
of Aegypt, which derived its existence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Shaw's Travels.</NOTE> from the
inundations of the Nile<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Proofs, art. XIX.</NOTE>. Such quantities of
earth are brought down, by the rapidity of the
Nile, from the interior parts of Africa, and de∣posited
during the inundations, that you may
dig fifty feet deep before you can reach the bot∣tom
of the slime and mud. Louisiana, and the
province of the Yellow river have, in the same
manner, been original formed by the slime
of rivers.</P>
<P>Farther, the Caspian Sea is a real lake. It has
no communication with any other sea, not even
with the Lake Aral, which appears to have
been a part of it, being only separated by a large
tract of sand, in which neither river nor canal
for carrying off the waters have been discovered.
This sea, therefore, has no external communica∣tion
with any other; and I doubt much if there
is any reason to suspect a subterraneous commu∣nication
with the Black Sea, or with the Gulf
of Persia. The Caspian, it is true, receives the
Wolga, and several other rivers, which appear
to furnish as much water as is lost by evapora∣tion.
But, independent of the difficulties attend∣ing
such calculations, if it communicates with any
other sea, a uniform and rapid current towards
the place of communication would be an infal∣lible
consequence; but no such thing has yet
been discovered. Travellers of the best credit
<PB N="38" REF="63"/>
assure us of the contrary; we, therefore, con∣clude,
that the Caspian Sea receives just as much
water from the rivers and clouds as it loses by
evaporation.</P>
<P>It is not improbable, that the Black Sea will,
some time or other, be entirely divided from the
Mediterranean; and that the Bosphorus will be
chocked up, whenever the rivers shall have ac∣cumulated
a sufficient quantity of materials to
bring about that effect. It is impossible to six
the aera of this event; but time, and the dimi∣nution
of waters in rivers, in proportion as the
mountains are lowered by the causes mentioned
above, will one day exhibit this phaenomenon to
the world.</P>
<P>The Caspian and Black Seas should, there∣fore,
be considered rather as lakes than as gulfs
of the ocean; because they exactly resemble o∣ther
lakes that receive a number of rivers with∣out
any visible outlet, as the Dead Sea, several
lakes in Africa, and elsewhere. Besides, the salt∣ness
of these two seas is not nearly equal to that
of the Mediterranean or the ocean; and it is an
agreed point, that the navigation in the Caspian
and Black seas, on account of their numberless
shoals, rocks, and banks, is so extremely hazard∣ous,
that only small vessels can be used in them
with safety. This circumstance proves farther,
that these seas ought not to be considered as gulfs
of the ocean, but as vast collections of water a∣massed
by large rivers.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="64"/>
If the isthmus which separates Africa from
Asia were cut, it would necessarily create a great
irruption of the sea upon the land. This was
formerly projected by the Kings of Aegypt, and
adopted since by the Califs. I doubt whether
the pretended communication between the Red
Sea and Mediterranean be sufficiently established.
The Red Sea is a narrow branch of the ocean:
Through its whole extent, not a single river runs
into it from the Aegyptian side, and very few
from the opposite. This sea will not, therefore,
be subject to diminution, like those seas or lakes
which are actually impaired by the slime and
sand brought down by large rivers. The Red
Sea receives all its waters directly from the o∣cean,
and the motion of the tides in it are very
discernible; of course, it must be affected by the
general motions of the ocean. The Mediterra∣nean,
on the other hand, must be lower than the
ocean; because the current through the Straits is
exceedingly rapid. Besides, it receives the Nile,
which runs parallel to the west coast of the Red
Sea, and passes through the longest extent of
Aegypt, which is a very low country. From
these circumstances, it is at least probable, that
the Red Sea is higher than the Mediterranean,
and, consequently, that, if the isthmus of Suez
were cut, a great inundation, and a considerable
augmentation of the Mediterranean, would en∣sue;
especially if the waters were not restrained
by dikes and sluices placed at proper distances.
<PB N="40" REF="65"/>
This precaution was probably used, if ever the
antient canal existed.</P>
<P>But, not to spend too much time on conjec∣tures,
which, however well founded, may per∣haps
appear rash, we shall give some certain and
recent examples of the changes of sea into land,
and of land into sea<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Proofs, art. XIX.</NOTE>. At Venice, the bottom of
the sea is constantly rising: If the canals had
not been carefully kept clean, the moats and ci∣ty
would, long ere now, have formed a part of
the continent. The same thing may be said of
most harbours, bays, and mouths of rivers. In
Holland, the bottom of the sea is elevated in ma∣ny
places; the gulf of Zuderzee and the straits
of the Texel, cannot receive such large vessels
as formerly. At the mouth of almost every ri∣ver,
we find small islands, and banks of earth
and sand brought down from the higher grounds;
and it is uncontravertible, that the sea is con∣stantly
dammed up, wherever great rivers empty
themselves. The Rhine is lost in the sands
which itself has accumulated. The Danube, the
Nile, and all large rivers, after having transport∣ed
great quantities of slime, sand, &amp;c. never more
arrive at the sea by a single channel; they split
into branches, the intervals of which consist of
the materials which they themselves have trans∣ported.
Marshes are daily drained; lands, a∣bandoned
by the sea, are now plowed and sown;
we navigate whole countries now covered by the
<PB N="41" REF="66"/>
waters; in a word, we see so many instances of
land changed into water, and water into land,
that we must be convinced of the continual,
though slow progress of such changes in all pla∣ces.
So that, in time, the gulfs of the ocean will
become continents; the isthmuses will be chan∣ged
into straits; and the tops of the mountains
will be metamorphosed into shoaly rocks in the
sea.</P>
<P>The waters, then, have covered, and may still
cover, every part of the earth which is now dry.
Our astonishment at finding the productions of
the sea dispersed every where, and a composition
of bodies which could not be effected by any o∣ther
means than the operation of the waters,
ought forever to cease. We have already ex∣plained
how the horizontal strata of the earth
were formed. But those perpendicular sissures,
which are equally diffused through rocks, clays,
and every constituent material of the globe, re∣main
to be considered. The perpendicular fis∣sures
are indeed placed at greater distances from
each other than the horizontal; and the softer
the matter, the more distant are the fissures. In
marble and hard stone, the fissures are only a
few feet asunder. If the mass of rock be ex∣tensive,
the distance betwixt the fissures is some
fathoms: Sometimes they extend from the sum∣mit
to the base of the rock, and sometimes they
terminate after arriving at a horizontal fissure.
They are uniformly perpendicular in the strata
<PB N="42" REF="67"/>
of all calcareous substances, as chalk, marles,
marble, &amp;c. But they are more oblique and
less regularly situated, in vitrescent bodies, brown
free-stone, and rocks of flint, where they are
often adorned with crystals and other minerals.
In quarries of marble, or of calcareous stone, the
fissures at filled with spar, gypsum, gravel, and
an earthy sand, which contains a considerable
portion of chalk. In marles, and every other
species of earth, except sand-stone, the perpen∣dicular
fissures are either empty or filled with
such matters as have been transported thither by
water.</P>
<P>The cause of perpendicular fissures is easily
investigated. As various materials constituting
the different strata were transported by the wa∣ters,
and deposited in the form of sediments,
they would at first be in a very diluted state, and
would gradually harden and part with the su∣perfluous
quantity of water they contained. In
the process of drying, they would naturally con∣tract,
and of course split at irregular distances.
These fissures necessarily assumed a perpendicu∣lar
direction; because, in this direction, the ac∣tion
of gravity of one particle upon another is
equal to nothing; but it acts directly opposite
to this description in a horizontal situation: The
diminution in bulk could have no sensible effect
but in a vertical line. I say, the contraction of
the parts in drying, not the contained water
forcing an issue, as has been alledged, is the cause
<PB N="43" REF="68"/>
of perpendicular fissures; for I have often re∣marked,
that the sides of those fissures, through
their whole extent, correspond as exactly as the
two sides of a split piece of wood. Their sur∣faces
are rude and irregular; whereas, if they
had taken their rise from the motion of wa∣ter,
they would have been smooth and polished.
Hence these fissures must have been produced,
either suddenly or gradually, by drying and con∣tracting,
like the cracks and fissures in green
wood; and the greatest part of the water the
bodies contained, must have evaporated by the
pores. In the chapter upon minerals, we shall
demonstrate, that some part of the original wa∣ter
still remains in stones and several other sub∣stances;
and that crystals, minerals, and some o∣ther
bodies, owe their existence to this water.</P>
<P>Perpendicular fissures vary greatly as to the
extent of their openings. Some are about half
an inch, or an inch, others a foot, or two feet;
some extend several fathoms, and give rise to
those vast precipices which so frequently occur
between opposite parts of the same rocks in the
Alps and other high mountains. It is plain,
that the fissures, the openings of which are small,
have been occasioned solely by drying. But
those which extend several feet, are partly ow∣ing
to another cause; namely, the sinking of
the foundation upon one side, while that of the
other remains firm. If the base sinks but a line
or two, when the height of the rock is conside∣rable,
<PB N="44" REF="69"/>
an opening of several feet, or even fa∣thoms,
will be the consequence. When rocks
are founded on clay or sand, they sometimes
slip a little to a side; and the fissures are of course
augmented by this motion. I have not hither∣to
mentioned those large openings, those prodi∣gious
cuts which are to be met with in rocks and
mountains: These could not be produced by a∣ny
other means than the sinking of immense
subterraneous caverns that were unable longer
to sustain their incumbent load. But these cuts
or intervals in mountains are not of the same
nature with perpendicular fissures: They ap∣pear
to have been ports opened by the hand of
nature for the communication of nations. This
seems to be the intention of all large openings
in chains of mountains, and of those straits by
which different parts of the ocean are connec∣ted;
as the Straits of Thermopyle, of Gibral∣tar,
&amp;c.; the gaps or ports in Mount Cauca∣sus,
the Cordeliers, &amp;c. A simple separation,
by the drying of the matter, could not produce
this effect: Large portions of earth must have
been sunk, swallowed up, or thrown down<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Proofs. art. XVII.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>These great sinkings, though occasioned by
accidental and secondary causes<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>, are leading
facts in the history of the earth, and have con∣tributed
greatly in changing the appearance of
its surface. Most of them have been produced
by subterraneous fires, the explosions of which
<PB N="45" REF="70"/>
give rise to earthquakes and volcano's. The
force of inflamed matter shut up in the bowels
of the earth is irresistible<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Agricola de rebus quae effluunt e terra. Phil. trans. a∣brid. vol. ii. p. 391. Ray's discourses. p. 272.</NOTE>. By the action of
subterraneous fires, whole cities have been swal∣lowed
up, mountains, and large tracts of coun∣try
have been overturned and rendered unfit for
the habitation of men. But, though this force
be great, though its effects appear to be prodi∣gious,
we cannot assent to the opinions of some
authors, who suppose that these subterraneous
fires are only branches of an immense abyss of
flame in the centre of the earth. Neither do we
credit the common notion, that these fires have
their seat at a great depth below the surface; for
matter cannot begin to burn, or at least the in∣flammation
cannot be supported, without air.
In examining the materials that issue from vol∣cano's,
even in their most violent eruptions, it
is easy to perceive that the furnace is not very
deep, and that the inflamed substances are the
same with those on the top of the mountain,
only disfigured by calcination and the melting
of the metallic particles they contain. To be
convinced that the matter thrown out by vol∣cano's
do not come from any considerable depth,
we need only attend to the height of the moun∣tain,
and consider the immense force which
would be necessary to project stones and mine∣rals
to the height of half a league; for Aetna,
<PB N="46" REF="71"/>
Hecla, and other volcano's, have at least that
elevation.</P>
<P>Now, it is well known, that fire acts equally
on all sides; it cannot, therefore, act upwards
with a force sufficient to throw large stones half
a league high, without an equal re-action on
the base and sides. But the sides of the moun∣tain
would very soon be pierced and blown to
pieces by this re-action; because the materials
of which it consists are not more dense or firm
than those which are projected. How, then, can
it be imagined, that the cavity, which must be
considered as the tube or cannon, could possibly
resist a force necessary to raise such heavy bodies
to the mouth of the volcano? Besides, suppose
the cavity deeper, as the external orifice is not
great, it would be impossible for so large a
quantity of liquid and burning matters to issue
forth at a time, without clashing against each
other, and against the irregular sides of the ca∣vity;
and, in passing through so long a space,
they would be in danger of cooling and con∣gealing.
Rivers of melted sulphur and bitumen,
projected from volcano's along with stones and
minerals, run from the tops of the mountains
into the plains. Is it natural to think, that mat∣ter
so fluid, so little able to resist violent action,
could be projected from a very great depth?
Every observation which can be made on this
subject will tend to prove, that the fire in vol∣cano's
is not very distant from the tops of the
<PB N="47" REF="72"/>
mountains, and never descends so low as the
level of the plains<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Borelli de incendiis Aetnae.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This account of volcano's, however, is not
inconsistent with their being the cause of consi∣derable
earthquakes; neither does it contradict
the communication of one volcano with ano∣ther,
by means of subtertaneous passages<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Phil. Trans. abridged, vol. 2. p. 392.</NOTE>. But
the depth of the furnace is the object of our
present investigation; and it cannot be very dis∣tant
from the mouth of the volcano. To pro∣duce
an earthquake in a plain, it is not necessary
that the bottom of the volcano should be below
the level of that plain, nor that there should be
subterraneous cavities filled with the same burn∣ing
matter under it. A violent explosion,
with which eruptions are uniformly accompa∣nied,
may, like that of a powder-magazine,
give such a concussion as to produce, by its re∣action,
an earthquake of considerable extent.</P>
<P>I mean not to say that there are no earth∣quakes
which derive their existence from sub∣terranean
fires<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Proofs, art. XVI.</NOTE>; but that there are earthquakes
produced solely by the explosion of volcano's.
In confirmation of what has been said upon this
subject, volcano's seldom or never appear in
plains; on the contrary, their mouths, or cra∣ters,
are always found on the tops of the high∣est
mountains. If the subterraneous fire of vol∣cano's
stretched below the plains, would not
<PB N="48" REF="73"/>
new passages be opened there during violent
eruptions, rather than in the tops of the moun∣tains,
where the resistance is greater? In the
first eruption, would it not have been easier to
pierce a plain, than a mountain of half a league
in height?</P>
<P>It is not difficult to discover the reason why
volcano's appear only in mountains. Greater
quantities of minerals, sulphur, and pyrites, exist
in mountains, and nearer the surface than in
plains. The mountains have likewise this far∣ther
advantage; they are more subject to the
impressions of the air, and receive more rain and
moisture, by which mineral substances are ca∣pable
of being fermented to such a degree as to
produce actual inflammation.</P>
<P>To conclude, it has often been observed, that,
after violent eruptions, the mountains have sunk
and diminished, nearly in proportion to the
quantity of matter thrown out, which is another
proof that volcano's are not so deep as the base
of the mountains, and even that they are not
much below the summit.</P>
<P>In many places, earthquakes have formed
considerable hollows, and even some large gaps
in mountains. All other inequalities are coeval
with the mountains themselves, and owe their
existence to currents in the ocean; for, in every
place which has not been disturbed by acciden∣tal
convulsions, the strata of mountains are pa∣rallel,
<PB N="49" REF="74"/>
and their angles correspond<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Proofs, art. XVII.</NOTE>. It is not
difficult to distinguish subterraneous caverns and
excavations formed by volcano's, from those
produced by water. The latter consist only of
solid rocks, the sand and clay with which they
were formerly filled being carried off by water,
which is the origin of caverns in hills; for those
found in plains are commonly nothing but old
pits and quarries, like the salt-quarries of Mae∣stricht,
the mines of Poland, &amp;c. But natural
caverns are proper to the mountains; the sum∣mit,
or higher parts, furnish them with water,
which afterwards issues out to the surface where∣ever
it can find a passage. These are the sources
of springs and rivers. When a large cavern of
this kind is suddenly filled up by the falling of
its roof, an inundation is generally the conse∣quence<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Phil. Trans. abridged, vol. 2. p. 322.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>From these facts, it is easy to perceive how
much subterraneous fires have contributed to
change both the surface and internal part of the
globe. This cause has power enough to pro∣duce
very great effects. But it is difficult to
conceive how any sensible alterations upon the
land can be introduced by the winds<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Proofs, art. XV.</NOTE>. Their
dominion would appear to be confined to the
sea. Indeed, next to the tides, nothing has such
a powerful influence upon the waters; the flux
and reflux proceed with an uniform pace; their
<PB N="50" REF="75"/>
operations are always the same; but the action
of the winds is capricious and violent. They
rush on with irresistible fury, and excite such
impetuous commotions, that the ocean, from a
smooth and tranquil plain, in an instant is fur∣rowed
with waves that emulate the height of
mountains, and dash themselves in pieces against
the shores. The surface of the ocean is subject
to constant alterations from the winds. But
ought not the surface of the land, which has so
solid an appearance, ever to remain uninfluenced
by a cause of this kind? It is consonant to experi∣ence,
however, that the winds raise mountains of
sand in Arabia and Africa; that they overwhelm
large plains with it; and that they frequently
carry these sands many leagues into the sea, where
they accumulate in such quantities as to form
banks, downs, and even islands<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bellarmin. de ascen. mentis in Deum. Varen. Geog. p. 282. Voyag. de Pyrand, tom. 1. p. 470.</NOTE>. It is also
well known, that hurricanes are the scourge of
the Antilles, of Madagascar, and of other coun∣tries,
where their impetuosity is so great, that
they sweep away trees, plants, and animals, to∣gether
with the soil which nourished them.
They drive back, they annihilate rivers, and
produce new ones; they overthrow rocks and
mountains; they scoup out holes and gulphs in
the earth, and totally change the face of those
unhappy countries that give birth to them. Hap∣pily,
<PB N="51" REF="76"/>
few climates are exposed to the violence of
those dreadful agitations of the air.</P>
<P>But the greatest changes upon the surface of
the earth are occasioned by rains, rivers, and tor∣rents
from the mountains. These derive their
origin from vapours raised by the sun from the
surface of the ocean, and which are transported
by the winds through every climate. The pro∣gress
of these vapours, which are supported by
the air, and transported at the pleasure of the
winds, is interrupted by the tops of the moun∣tains,
where they accumulate into clouds, and
fall down in the form of rain, dew, or snow.
At first, these waters descended into the plains
without any fixed course<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See proofs, art. X. and XVIII.</NOTE>; but they gradually
hollowed out proper channels for themselves.
By the power of gravity, they ran to the bottom
of the mountains, and, penetrating or dissolving
the lower grounds, they carried along with them
sand and gravel, cut deep furrows in the plains,
and thus opened passages to the sea, which al∣ways
receives as much water by rivers, as it
loses by evaporation. The windings in the
channels of rivers have uniformly corresponding
angles on their opposite banks; and, as moun∣tains
and hills, which may be regarded as the
banks of the valleys by which they are separa∣ted,
have likewise sinuosities with corresponding
angles, this circumstance seems to demonstrate,
that the valleys have been gradually formed by
<PB N="52" REF="77"/>
currents of the ocean, in the same manner as
the channels of rivers have been produced.</P>
<P>The waters which run upon the surface, and
support the verdure and fertility of the soil,
compose not perhaps one half of the quantity
that is produced by vapour. Numberless veins
of water sink deep into the bowels of the earth.
In some places, you are certain of obtaining
water by digging; in others, none can be found.
In almost all the valleys and low grounds, at a
certain depth, water is uniformly to be met
with. But, in all high grounds, it is impossible
to extract water from the bowels of the earth.
It must be collected from the heavens. There
are extensive countries where no wells can be
obtained; there men, and other animals, are
supplied with drink from cisterns and pools. In
the cast, and especially in Arabia, Aegypt, and
Persia, wells and springs are great and valuable
rarities. To supply their place, the inhabitants
have been obliged to make large reservoirs to
collect the water that falls from the heavens.
These works, projected and executed from public
necessity, constitute the most beautiful and mag∣nificent
monuments of the east. Some eastern
reservoirs have more than two square leagues of
superficies, and fertilize whole provinces by
numberless ducts and canals let out from all sides.
But, in plain countries, furnished with large ri∣vers,
it is impossible to break the surface of the
earth without finding water. In camps situated in
<PB N="53" REF="78"/>
the neighbourhood of rivers, it often happens,
that every tent may have its own well, by giving
a few strokes with a pick-ax.</P>
<P>Most of the water, so liberally diffused through
low grounds, comes from the neighbouring hills
and eminences. During great rains, or the sud∣den
melting of snow, part of the water runs up∣on
the surface; but most of it penetrates the
earth and rocks, by means of small chinks and
fissures. This water rises again to the surface,
whenever it can find an issue; but it often drills
through sands, and creeps along till it finds a
bottom of clay, or hard earth, and there forms
subterraneous lakes, brooks, and perhaps rivers,
of which the channels are for ever buried in o∣blivion.
Subterraneous rivers, however, must
follow the general law of nature, and uniformly
run from the higher to the lower ground; their
waters must of course either fall at last into the
sea, or be collected in some low place, whether
at the surface, or in the bowels of the earth:
For there are several lakes which neither receive
nor give rise to any river. A still greater num∣ber
receive no considerable river, but are the
sources of the largest rivers on earth; as the
lakes from which the river St Laurence issues;
the lake Chiamè, from which two large rivers
arise, that water the kingdoms of Asem and
Pegu; the lakes of Assiniboil in America; those
of Ozera in Muscovy; those that give rise to
<PB N="54" REF="79"/>
the Bog and the Irtis, and many others<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Proofs, art. XI.</NOTE>. It
is plain, that these lakes must derive their exist∣ence
from the waters of superior grounds, run∣ning
through subterraneous passages. Some,
indeed, have affirmed, that lakes are to be met
with on the tops of the highest mountains. But
this is incredible; for the lakes found on the
Alps, and other elevated situations, are all over∣topped
by higher mountains, and derive their
origin from the waters which run down the
sides, or are filtered through the bowels of these
superior eminences, in the same manner as the
lakes in valleys are supplied.</P>
<P>From this reasoning, the existence of subter∣raneous
collections of water, especially under
large plains, is apparent<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Proofs, art. XVIII.</NOTE>: For mountains, hills,
and heights of every kind, are exposed on all
sides to the weather. The waters that fall up∣on
their summits, and upon elevated plains, after
penetrating the earth, must, from the declivity of
the ground, break out at many places in the form
of springs and fountains: Of course, little water
will be found in the bowels of mountains. But,
in plains, as the water filtrated through the
earth can find no issue, it must be collected in sub∣terraneous
caverns, or dispersed in small veins,
among sand and gravel. This is the origin of
the water so universally diffused through low
grounds. The bottom of a pit or well, is only
a small artificial bason, into which the water in∣sinuates
<PB N="55" REF="80"/>
itself from the higher grounds. At first
it generally falls in by drops; but afterwards,
when the passages become more open, it receives
fresh supplies from greater distances, and runs
in small continued veins or rills. To this cir∣cumstance
it is owing, that, although water may
be found in any part of a plain, only a certain
number of wells can be supplied. This number
is in proportion to the quantity of water diffused,
or rather to the extent of the higher grounds
from which it comes.</P>
<P>To find water, it is unnecessary to dig below
the level of the river. It is commonly found at
smaller depths. The water of rivers seldom
spreads far in the earth by filtration. Even
what is found in the earth below the level of
rivers, is not derived from them; for, in rivers
which have been dried up, or whose courses have
been changed, no greater quantity of water is
obtained by digging, than in the neighbouring
ground at an equal depth. Five or six feet of
earth is sufficient to contain water, and to pre∣vent
its escape: I have often remarked, that the
banks of rivulets or pools have no sensible
moisture at the distance of six inches from the
water. It is true, the filtration is always in
proportion to the penetrability of the ground.
But, upon examining the stagnating pools with
a sandy bottom, it is remarkable that the moi∣sture
spreads but a few inches. Neither is the
extent of it great in a vegetable soil, which is
<PB N="56" REF="81"/>
much more loose and porous than sand or hard
earth. A garden-bed, though plentifully wa∣tered,
communicates little or no moisture to those
adjoining. I have examined level heaps of gar∣den-earth,
of six or eight feet thick, which had
remained undisturbed for some years, and found
that the rain-water had never reached above
three or four feet deep. I have made the same
observation upon earth which had lain 200 years
in ridges: Below the depth of three or four feet,
it was as dry as dust. Hence the spreading of
water by filtration alone, is not so extensive as
has generally been imagined. Very little can
descend in this way to the bowels of the earth.
But water, by its own gravity, descends from the
surface to the greatest depths. It sinks through
natural conduits, or forces passages for itself: It
follows the roots of trees, the sissures of rocks,
or their interstices. It divides and expands on
all hands into an infinite number of small branches
or rills; and uniformly descends till its progress
is stopped by clay or a solid earth, where it ac∣cumulates
and breaks out to the surface in form
of a spring or fountain.</P>
<P>It would be no easy task to make an exact
calculation of the quantity of subterraneous wa∣ters
which have no apparent issue<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Proofs, art. X. XI. and XVIII.</NOTE>. Many
pretend that it greatly surpasses all the waters
on the surface: Not to mention those who think
that the interior part of the globe is entirely fill∣ed
<PB N="57" REF="82"/>
with water, it is imagined by some, that
there is an infinite number of rivers, rills, and
lakes, in the bowels of the earth. But this opi∣nion
seems to have no proper foundation; and
it is probable, that the quantity of subterrane∣ous
waters which never appear at the surface, is
very inconsiderable; for, if the number of sub∣terraneous
rivers were so great, Why do we
never see any of their mouths break out, like
springs, on the surface? Besides, rivers produce
considerable changes on the surface of the earth;
they carry off the soil; they wear away the most
solid rocks, and remove every thing that opposes
their passage. The same effects would result from
subterraneous rivers. But no such changes have
ever been discovered; nothing below the surface
is displaced; the different strata every where
preserve their parallel and primitive position;
and it is only in very few places that subter∣raneous
veins of water, of any consideration,
have been discovered. Thus, the internal ope∣ration
of water, though great, is not affected by
the motion of it in large bodies: As it is divi∣ded
into an infinity of small veins, which are
often shut up by numberless obstacles, it gives
rise to many substances, which are totally differ∣ent,
both in form and structure, from those of
the primitive matter.</P>
<P>From what has been advanced, we may con∣clude,
that the flux and reflux of the ocean have
produced all the mountains, valleys, and other
<PB N="58" REF="83"/>
inequalities on the surface of the earth; that cur∣rents
of the sea have scouped out the valleys,
elevated the hills, and bestowed on them their
corresponding directions; that the same waters
of the ocean, by transporting and depositing
earth, &amp;c. have given rise to the parallel strata;
that the waters from the heavens gradually de∣stroy
the effects of the sea, by continually di∣minishing
the height of the mountains, filling
up the valleys, and choaking the mouths of ri∣vers;
and, by reducing every thing to its for∣mer
level, they will, in time, restore the earth to
the sea, which, by its natural operations, will a∣gain
create new continents, interspersed with
mountains and valleys, and every way similar to
those which we now inhabit.</P>

<HEAD>PROOFS

THEORY OF THE EARTH.</HEAD>
<HEAD>ARTICLE I.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the Formation of Planets.</HEAD>
<P>NATURAL history being our subject, we
would willingly dispense with astrono∣mical
observations. But, as the Earth is so near∣ly
related to the heavenly bodies, and as obser∣vations
of this kind illustrate more fully those doc∣trines
we have already advanced, it is necessary to
give some general ideas of the formation, mo∣tion,
and figure of the earth, and other planets.</P>
<P>The earth is a globe of about 3000 leagues in
diameter; it is situated 30 million of leagues from
the sun, round which it revolves in 365 days.
This annual revolution is the effect of two
forces; the one may be considered as an impulse
from right to left, or from left to right; the
<PB N="60" REF="85"/>
other as an attraction from above downwards, or
from below upwards, to a common centre. The
direction and quantity of these forces are com∣bined,
and so nicely adjusted, that they produce
a uniform motion in an ellipse approaching to
a circle. Like the other planets, the earth is
opaque, throws out a shadow, and reflects the
rays of the sun, about which it revolves in a
time proportioned to its relative distance and
density. It likewise revolves about its own axis
in 24 hours; and its axis is inclined to the plane
of its orbit 66½ degrees. Its figure is that of a
spheroid, the two axes of which differ from each
other about 165th part; and it revolves round
the shortest axis.</P>
<P>These are the principal phaenomena of the
earth, the results of discoveries made by means
of geometry, astronomy, and navigation. It is
unnecessary here to enumerate the proofs and
observations by which these facts have been e∣stablished.
We shall confine our remarks to
such objects as are still doubtful; and shall there∣fore
proceed to give our ideas concerning the
formation of planets, and the changes they have
undergone, previous to their arriving at the state
in which we now perceive them. To the many
systems and hypotheses that have been framed
concerning the formation of the earth, and the
different states it has passed through, we may be
allowed to add our own conjectures, especially
as we are determined to support them with a su∣perior
<PB N="61" REF="86"/>
degree of probability; and we are the
more encouraged to deliver our notions on this
subject, because we hope to enable the reader to
distinguish between an hypothesis which consists
only of possibilities, and a theory supported by
facts; between a system, such as we are about to
give, of the formation and primitive state of the
earth, and a physical history of its real condition,
which has been given in the preceding discourse.</P>
<P>Galileo having traced the laws of falling bo∣dies,
and Kepler having observed, that the areas
which the principal planets describe in moving
round the sun, and those of the satellites round
the planets to which they belong, were propor∣tioned
to the periods of their revolutions, and
that these periods were as the square roots of the
cubes of their distances from the sun, or from
the principal planets. Newton discovered that the
power of gravity extended to the moon, and re∣tained
it in its orbit; that the force of gravity
diminished in exact proportion to the squares of
the distances, and, consequently, that the moon
is attracted by the earth; that the earth, and all
planets, are attracted by the sun; and, in gene∣ral,
that all bodies which revolve about a centre,
and describe areas proportioned to the periods of
their revolution, are attracted by that luminary.
Gravity, therefore, is a general law of nature.
The planets, comets, the sun, the earth, are all
subject to its laws; and it is the source of that
harmony which prevails in the universe. Nothing
<PB N="62" REF="87"/>
in physics is better established than the existence
of this power in every material body. Repeated
experience has confirmed the effects of its in∣fluence,
and the labour and ingenuity of geo∣meters
have determined its quantity and rela∣tions.</P>
<P>This general law being once discovered, the
effects of it would be easily explained, if the
action of those bodies which produce them were
not too complicated. A slight view of the solar
system will convince us of the difficulties which
attend this subject. The principal planets are
attracted by the sun, the sun by the planets, the
satellites by the principal planets, and each pla∣net
attracts all the others, and is attracted by
them. All these actions and re-actions vary ac∣cording
to the quantities of matter and the di∣stances,
and give rise to great inequalities, and
even irregularities. How are so many relations
to be combined and estimated? Among such a
number of objects, how is it possible to trace
any individual? These difficulties, however,
have been surmounted; the reasonings of theo∣ry
have been confirmed by calculation; every
observation has produced a new demonstration;
and the systematic order of the universe is now
laid open to every man who is able to distin∣guish
truth from error.</P>
<P>The force of impulsion, or what is common∣ly
called the centrifugal force, is still unknown;
<PB N="63" REF="88"/>
but it affects not the general theory. It is evi∣dent,
that, as the attractive force continually
draws all the planets towards the sun, they
would fall in a perpendicular line into that lu∣minary,
if they were not kept at a distance by
some other power, forcing them to move in a
straight line. If, again, this impulsive force
were not counteracted by that of attraction, all
the planets would fly off in the tangents of their
respective orbits. This progressive or impulsive
force was unquestionably at first communicated
to the planets by the Supreme Being. But, in
physical subjects, we ought, as much as possible,
to avoid having recourse to supernatural causes;
and, I imagine, a probable reason may be as∣signed
for the impulsive force of the planets,
which will be agreeable to the laws of mecha∣nics,
and not more surprising than many revolu∣tions
that must have happened in the universe.</P>
<P>The sphere of the sun's attraction is not limit∣ed
by the orbits of the planets, but extends to
an indefinite distance, always decreasing accor∣ding
as the squares of the augmented distances.
The comets, it is evident, which escape our sight
in the heavenly regions, are, like the planets,
subject to the attraction of the sun, and by it their
motions are regulated. All these bodies, the di∣rections
of which are so various, move round
the sun, and describe areas proportioned to their
periods, the planets in ellipses, more or less cir∣cular,
and the comets, in narrow ellipses of vast
<PB N="64" REF="89"/>
extent. The motions, therefore, both of planets
and comets, are regulated by impulsive and at∣tractive
forces continually acting upon them,
and obliging them to describe curves. But it is
worthy of remark, that comets run through the
system in all directions; that the inclinations of
the planes of their orbits are so very different,
that though, like the planets, they be subject to
the law of attraction, they have nothing in com∣mon
with regard to their progressive or impul∣sive
motions, but appear, in this respect, to be
absolutely independent of each other. The pla∣nets,
on the contrary, move round the sun in
the same direction, and nearly in the same
plane, the greatest inclination of their planes
not exceeding 7½ degrees. This similarity in
the position and motion of the planets indicates,
that their impulsive or centrifugal forces must
have originated from one common cause.</P>
<P>May we not conjecture, that a comet falling
into the body of the sun might drive off some
parts from its surface, and communicate to
them a violent impulsive force, which they still
retain? This conjecture appears to be as well
founded as that of Mr Leibnitz, which supposed
the earth and planets to have formerly been
suns; and his system, of which an abridgement
will be given in art. V. would have been more
comprehensive, and more consonant to probabi∣lity,
if it had embraced the above idea. We
agree with him, that this effect was produced at
<PB N="65" REF="90"/>
the time when God is said by Moses to have se∣parated
the light from darkness; for, according
to Leibnitz, the light was separated from the
darkness when the planets were extinguished.
But, on our supposition, there was a real physi∣cal
separation; because the opaque bodies of the
planets were detached from the luminous mat∣ter
of which the sun is composed.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If M. de Buffon had known, that the nucleus of the sun was a solid and opaque matter, a discovery lately made by the ingenious Dr Wilson of Glasgow, his hypothesis would have laboured under fewer difficulties.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This notion concerning the cause of the cen∣trifugal
force of the planets will appear to be
less exceptionable, after we have collected the
analogies, and estimated the degrees of probabi∣lity
by which it may be supported. We shall
first mention, that the motion of the planets
have one common direction, namely, from west
to east. By the doctrine of chances, it is easy
to demonstrate, that this circumstance makes it
as 64 to 1, that the planets could not all move
in the same direction, if their centrifugal forces
had not proceeded from the same cause.</P>
<P>This probability will be greatly augmented,
if we take in the similarity in the inclinations
of the planes of their orbits, which exceed not
7½ degrees; for, by calculations it has been dis∣covered,
that it is 24 to 1 against any two pla∣nets
being found, at the same time, in the most
distant parts of their orbits; and, consequently,
24<SUP>5</SUP>, or 7692624 to 1, that this effect could not
<PB N="66" REF="91"/>
be produced by accident; or, what amounts to
the same, there is this great degree of probabi∣lity,
that the planets have been impressed with
one common moving force, from which they
have derived this singular position. But no∣thing
could bestow this common centrifugal
motion, excepting the force and direction of the
bodies by which it was originally communica∣ted.
We may, therefore, conclude, that all the
planets have probably received their centrifugal
motion by one single stroke. Having establish∣ed
this degree of probability, which almost a∣mounts
to a certainty, I next inquire what mo∣ving
bodies could produce this effect; and I can
find nothing but comets capable of communica∣ting
motion to such vast masses.</P>
<P>Upon examining the course of comets, it is
easy to believe that some of them must occa∣sionally
fall into the sun. The comet 1680 ap∣proached
so near, that, at its perihelion, it was
not more distant from the sun than a sixteenth
part of its diameter; and, if it returns, which is
extremely probable, in the year 2255, it may
then fall into the sun. This must depend upon
the accidents it meets with in its course, and the
retardations it suffers in passing through the sun's
atmosphere<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Newt. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 3. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>We may, therefore, presume, with the great
Newton, that comets sometimes fall into the
sun. But they may fall in different directions.
<PB N="67" REF="92"/>
If they fall perpendicularly, or in a direction
not very oblique, they will remain in the body
of the sun, serve the purposes of feuel, and, by
their impulse, remove the sun from his place,
in proportion to the quantity of matter they
contain<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quaer. Would not such an event, by augmenting the sun's quantity of matter, and, consequently, his attractive power, pro∣duce other changes in the solar system?</NOTE> But, if a comet falls in a very o∣blique
direction, which will most frequently
happen, it will only graze the surface, or pene∣trate
to no great depth. In this case, it may
force its way past the sun, detach certain por∣tions
of his body, to which it will communicate
a common impulsive motion; and these portions
pushed off from the sun, and even the comet
itself, may turn planets, which will revolve
round this luminary in the same direction, and
nearly in the same plane. A calculation, per∣haps,
might be made of the quantity of matter,
velocity, and direction, a comet ought to have,
in order to force from the sun masses equal to
those which compose the six planets and their
satellites. But it is sufficient here to observe,
that the whole planets, with their satellites,
make not a 650th part of the sun's mass<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Newt. p. 405.</NOTE>; for,
although the density of Saturn and Jupiter be
less than that of the sun, and though the earth
be four times, and the moon near five times
more dense than the sun; yet they are only
atoms when compared to his immense volume.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="93"/>
It must be acknowledged, that, although a
650th part of a whole may seem inconsiderable,
it would require a very large comet to detach
this part from the sun. But, if we consider the
prodigious rapidity of comets in their perihelion,
the near approach they make to the sun; the
density and the strong cohesion of parts neces∣sary
to sustain, without destruction, the incon∣ceivable
heat they undergo; and the solid and
brilliant nucleus which shines through their dark
atmospheres; it cannot be doubted that comets
are composed of matters extremely dense and
solid; that they contain, in small limits, a great
quantity of matter; and, consequently, that a
comet of no enormous size may remove the sun
from his place, and give a projectile motion to
a mass of matter equal to the 650th part of his
body. This remark corresponds with what we
know concerning the respective densities of the
planets, which always decrease in proportion to
their distances from the sun, having less force of
heat to resist. Accordingly, Saturn is less dense
than Jupiter, and Jupiter much less than the
earth. Thus, if the density of the planets, as
Newton alledges, be in proportion to the quan∣tity
of heat they support, Mercury will be seven
times denser than the earth, and 28 times denser
than the sun, and the comet 1680 28,000 times
more dense than the earth, or 112,000 times
denser than the sun. Now, supposing the quan∣tity
of matter in this comet to be equal to a
<PB N="69" REF="94"/>
ninth part of the sun, or, allowing it to be only
100dth part of the bulk of the earth, its quanti∣ty
of matter would still be equal to a 900dth
part of the sun: Hence a body of this kind,
which would be but a small comet, might push
off from the sun a 900dth or a 650th part, espe∣cially
when the amazing rapidity of comets, in
their perihelion, is taken into the calculation.</P>
<P>The correspondence between the density of
the whole planets, and that of the sun, deserves
also to be noticed. Upon and near the surface
of the earth, there are substances 1400 or 1500
times denser than others; the densities of air
and gold are nearly in this proportion. But the
interior parts of the earth and planets are more
uniform, and differ little with regard to density;
and the correspondence in the density of the
planets and that of the sun is so great, that, out
of 650 parts, which comprehends the whole
density of the planets, there are more than 640
nearly of the same density with the solar mat∣ter;
and there are only ten of those 650 that
are of a superior density; for the density of Sa∣turn
and Jupiter is nearly the same with that
of the sun; and the quantity of matter in those
two planets is at least 64 times greater than
what is contained in the four inferior planets,
Mars, the Earth, Venus, and Mercury. We
may, therefore, conclude, that, in general, the
matter of the planets is very nearly of the same
kind with the solar matter, and, of course, that
<PB N="70" REF="95"/>
the former may have been separated from the
latter.</P>
<P>To this theory, it may be objected, that, if the
planets had been driven off from the sun by a
comet, in place of describing circles round him,
they must, according to the law of projectiles,
have returned to the same place from whence
they had been forced; and, therefore, that the
projectile force of the planets cannot be attribu∣ted
to the impulse of a comet.</P>
<P>I reply, that the planets issued not from the
sun in the form of globes, but in the form of
torrents, the motion of whose anterior particles
behoved to be accelerated by those behind, and
the attraction of the anterior particles would al∣so
accelerate the motion of the posterior; and
that this acceleration, produced by one or both
of these causes, might be such as would necessa∣rily
change the original motion arising from the
impulse of the comet, and that, from this cause,
might result a motion similar to what takes place
in the planets, especially when it is considered,
that the shock of the comets removes the sun
out of its former station. This reasoning may
be illustrated by an example. Suppose a musket∣ball
discharged from the top of a mountain,
and that the force of the powder was sufficient
to push it beyond a semidiameter of the earth,
it is certain that this ball would revolve round
the earth, and return at every revolution to the
place from whence it had been discharged. But,
<PB N="71" REF="96"/>
instead of a musket-ball, if a rocket were em∣ployed,
the continued action of the fire would
greatly accelerate the original impulsive motion.
This rocket would by no means return to the
same point, like the ball; but, <HI>caeter is paribus,</HI>
would describe an orbit, the perigee of which
would be more or less distant from the earth in
proportion to the greatness of the change pro∣duced
in its direction by the accelerating force
of the fire. In the same manner, if the original
projectile force impressed by the comet on the
torrent of solar matter was accelerated, it is pro∣bable,
that the planets formed by this torrent
acquired their circular or elliptical movements
around the sun.</P>
<P>The appearances exhibited in great eruptions
from volcano's may give some idea of this acce∣leration
of motion. When Vesuvius begins to
groan and throw out inflamed matter, it has been
often remarked, that the motion of the cloud
first ejected is flower than the succeeding ones,
and that they go on increasing in celerity, till at
last sulphur, lava, melted metal, and huge stones
are thrown up; and that, though these observe
nearly the same direction, they alter consider∣ably
that of the first cloud, and elevate it to a
greater height than it would otherwise have
reached<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This reasoning is ingenious; but its solidity is suspicious. The evomitions from volcano's, and the elevation the matter ac∣quires, are effects of successive impulses. The impulse from a comet upon the sun must necessarily be single and instantaneous; which seems to weaken the analogy which the author means to establish.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="97"/>
The objection will be still farther obviated, if
it is considered, that the impulse of the comet
must, in some degree, have communicated a mo∣tion
to the sun, and removed it from its former
situation; and that, although this motion may
now be so small as to escape the notice of astro∣nomers,
it may still, however, exist, and make
the sun describe a curve round the center of gra∣vity
of the system. If this be allowed, as I pre∣sume
it will, the planets, instead of returning to
the sun's body, would describe orbits, the peri∣helions
of which would be as distant from the
sun as the space which he presently occupies is
distant from his original station.</P>
<P>It may be further objected, that, if motion
be accelerated in the same direction, no change
in the perihelion could take place. But, is it
credible, that no change of direction can hap∣pen
in a torrent whose particles succeed each
other? On the contrary, it is extremely pro∣bable,
that a change was actually produced suf∣ficient
to cause the planets move in their pre∣sent
orbits.</P>
<P>It may still be objected, that, if the situation
of the sun had been changed by the shock of a
comet, it would move uniformly; and, of course,
this motion being common to the whole system,
no alteration would be effected. But, previous
to the shock, might not the sun move round
<PB N="73" REF="98"/>
the centre of the cometary system; and might
not this primary motion be augmented or dimi∣nished
by the stroke of the comet? Is not
this sufficient to account for the actual motion
of the planets?</P>
<P>If none of these suppositions be admitted,
may it not be presumed, that the elasticity of the
sun might elevate the torrent above his surface,
in place of pushing it directly forward? This of
itself would be sufficient to remove the perihe∣lion,
and endow the planets with their present
movements. Neither is this supposition desti∣tute
of foundation: The solar matter may be
exceedingly elastic; since light, the only part
of it we are acquainted with, seems, by its ef∣fects,
to be perfectly elastic. I acknowledge
that I cannot determine which of the causes a∣bove
assigned has actually produced an altera∣tion
in the projectile force of the planets; but
they at least show that such a change is not
only possible, but probable; and this is enough
for my present purpose.</P>
<P>Without farther insisting on the objections
that may be made against my hypothesis, or the
analogical proofs that might be brought in sup∣port
of it, I shall prosecute my subject, and draw
the proper conclusions. Let us first examine
what might happen to the planets, and particu∣larly
to the earth, when they were impressed
with their projectile forces, and what was their
state after their separation from the body of the
<PB N="74" REF="99"/>
sun. A projectile motion having been commu∣nicated
by the stroke of a comet, to a quantity
of matter equal to a 650th part of the sun's
mass, the light particles would separate from
the dense, and, by their mutual attractions, form
globes of different solidities. Saturn being com∣posed
of the largest and lightest parts, would be
removed to the greatest distance from the sun;
Jupiter, being denser than Saturn, would have
a nearer station; and so of the rest. The largest
and least solid planets are most distant, be∣cause
they received a greater projectile force
than the smaller and denser; for the projectile
force being proportioned to the surfaces to which
it is applied, the same stroke would make the
larger and lighter parts of the solar matter move
with more rapidity than the smaller and hea∣vier.
The parts, therefore, which differed in
density would separate from each other in such
a manner, that, if the density of the solar matter
be equal to 100, that of Saturn will be equal to
67, of Jupiter, = 94½, of Mars, = 200, of the
Earth, = 400, of Venus, = 800, of Mercury,
= 2800. But, as the attractive force acts not
in proportion to the surface, but to the quantity
of matter, it would retard the progress of the
more dense parts of the solar matter; and it is
for this reason that we find the most dense pla∣nets
nearest the sun, and which move round
him with more rapidity than those that are more
distant, and less dense.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="100"/>
The density and projectile motion of Saturn
and Jupiter, the two largest planets in the system,
have the most exact proportion. The density
of Saturn is to that of Jupiter as 67 to 94½, and
their velocities are nearly as 88⅔ to 120 1/72, or as
67 to 90 11/16;. How rarely do pure conjectures
correspond so exactly to the phaenomena of na∣ture?
It is true, according to this relation be∣tween
the celerity and density of the planets,
the density of the earth ought not to exceed
206 7/18, instead of 400, which is its real density;
hence it may be supposed, that the earth has now
double its original density. With regard to the
other planets, Mars, Venus, and Mercury, as
their densities are only conjectural, we know
not whether this circumstance would confirm or
weaken our hypothesis. Newton says, that the
densities of the planets are proportioned to the
degrees of heat they are exposed to; and, it is
in consequence of this idea, that we have men∣tioned
Mars as being one time less dense than
the earth, Venus one time, Mercury seven times,
and the comet 1680, 28,000 times denser than
the earth. But, if we attend to Saturn and Ju∣piter,
the two principal planets, we will find,
that this supposed proportion between the den∣sities
of the planets, and the heat they sustain, is
not well founded: For, according to this hy∣pothesis,
the density of Saturn would be as 4 7/18,
and that of Jupiter as 14 17/22, instead of the pro∣portions
of 67 and 94½; differences so great as
<PB N="76" REF="101"/>
to destroy the principles upon which they are
founded. Thus, notwithstanding the regard due
to the conjectures of Newton, I cannot help
thinking that the densities of the planets have a
nearer relation to their celerities than to the de∣grees
of heat to which they are exposed. This,
indeed, is only a final cause; but the other is a
physical relation, the exactness of which is re∣markable
in Saturn and Jupiter. It is, however,
certain, that the density of the earth, instead of
being 206⅞, is 400; and, consequently, the earth
must have suffered a condensation in the propor∣tion
of 206½ to 400.</P>
<P>But, have the condensations of the planets no
relation to the quantity of solar heat they su∣stain?
In that case, Saturn, which is at the
greatest distance from the sun, would have suf∣fered
little or no condensation; and Jupiter
would be condensed from 90 11/16 to 94½. Now,
the sun's heat in Jupiter being to his heat in the
earth as 14 17/22 to 400, their condensation ought
to be in the same proportion. Thus, if Jupiter
be condensed as 90 11/16 to 94½, the earth, if it
had been in the orbit of Jupiter, would have
been condensed from 206⅞ to 215 990/1452; but the
earth being much nearer the sun, and receiving
heat, in proportion to that of Jupiter, as 400 to
14 17/22, the quantity of condensation it would
have undergone in the orbit of Jupiter must be
multiplied by the proportion of 400 to 14 17/22,
which will give nearly 234⅓ for the condensa∣tion
<PB N="77" REF="102"/>
the earth must have received. The density
of the earth was 206⅞; by adding its acquired
condensation, its actual density will be 400⅞,
which is nearly the same with 400, its real den∣sity
determined by the moon's parallax. With
regard to the other planets, I pretend not to give
exact proportions, but only approximations,
tending to show, that their densities have a
strong connection with the celerity of their mo∣tions
in their respective orbits.</P>
<P>The comet, by falling obliquely on the sun,
as mentioned above, must have forced off from
his surface a quantity of matter equal to a 650th
part of his body. This matter being in a liquid
state, would at first form a torrent, of which the
largest and rarest parts would fly to the greatest
distances; the smaller and more dense, having re∣ceived
only an equal impulse, would remain
nearer the sun; his power of attraction would
operate upon all the parts detached from his
body, and make them circulate round him; and,
at the same time, the mutual attraction of the
particles of matter would cause all the detached
parts to take on the form of globes, at differ∣ent
distances from the sun, the nearer moving
with greater rapidity in their orbits than the
more remote.</P>
<P>But, to this it may be objected, that, if the
planets had been detached from the sun, they
must have been burning and luminous, not cold
and opaque bodies; nothing can have less re∣semblance
<PB N="78" REF="103"/>
to a globe of fire than a globe com∣posed
of earth and water; and, by comparison,
the matter of the earth is totally different from
that of the sun.</P>
<P>It may be replied to this objection, that the
matter changed its form upon its separation, and
that the fire, or light, was extinguished by the
projectile motion communicated by the stroke.
Besides, may it not be supposed, that the sun, or
a burning star, moving with a rapidity equal to
that of the planets, would soon be extinguished;
and that this may be the reason why all the
luminous, or burning stars, are fixed, and with∣out
motion; and why those called new stars,
which have probably changed their stations, are
frequently extinguished and disappear? To con∣firm
this remark, comets, when in their perihe∣lia,
ought to be inflamed even to their center;
but they never become luminous stars; they on∣ly
emit a burning vapour, a considerable portion
of which they leave behind them in their course.</P>
<P>In a medium which has little resistance, I ac∣knowledge,
that fire may subsist, although the
burning body be moved with great rapidity. It
must likewise be acknowledged, that what I have
said applies only to those stars which disappear
for ever, not to those that appear and disappear
at stated intervals, without changing their situa∣tions
in the heavens. Of these Maupertuis, in
his discourse on the figure of the stars, has
given a most satisfactory account. But those
<PB N="79" REF="104"/>
which have appeared, and then vanished for
ever, must unquestionably have been extin∣guished
either by the quickness of their motion,
or some other cause. There is not a single ex∣ample
of a luminous star revolving round an∣other;
and not one of the sixteen planets
which revolve round the sun have any light in
themselves.</P>
<P>Farther, fire, in small masses, cannot subsist
so long as in large ones. The planets would
burn a considerable time after they issued from
the sun; but, at length, would extinguish for
want of combustible matter. For the same rea∣son,
the sun itself will be extinguished; but at a
period as much beyond that which extinguished
the planets, as the quantity of matter in the sun
exceeds that of the planets. However this may
be, the separation of the planets from the sun,
by the shock of a comet, appears sufficient to
account for their extinction.</P>
<P>The earth and planets, when they issued from
the sun, were totally composed of liquid fire; in
which state they would continue no longer than
the violence of the heat that kept them in fusion.
But this heat would gradually decay from the
moment they left the sun. During their fluid
state, they necessarily assumed circular fi∣gures;
and their diurnal motion would elevate
their equators, and flatten their poles. I agree
with M. Leibnitz<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Act. Erud. Lips. an. 1692.</NOTE>, that this figure corresponds
<PB N="80" REF="105"/>
so exactly with the laws of hydrostatics, that the
earth and planets must necessarily have been
once in a state of fluidity occasioned by fire;
and consequently, that the interior parts of the
earth must be composed of vitrified matter, of
which sand, free-stone, granite, and perhaps
clay, are fragments, or scoriae.</P>
<P>It is therefore extremely probable, that the
planets were originally parts of the sun sepa∣rated
by a stroke which communicated to them
a projectile motion; and that their different
distances proceeded solely from the difference of
their densities. To compleat this theory, it on∣ly
remains to account for the diurnal motion of
the planets, and the origin of their satellites;
and this, instead of adding fresh difficulties, will
tend greatly to confirm my hypothesis: For ro∣tation,
or what is called diurnal motion, entire∣ly
depends on the obliquity of the stroke; an
oblique impulse on the surface of a body neces∣sarily
gives it a rotatory motion. If the body
which receives the impulse be homogeneous, the
rotatory motion will always be equal and uni∣form;
but it will be unequal, if the body con∣sist
of heterogeneous parts, or of parts different
in density. Hence we may conclude, that the
matter of each planet is homogeneous, because
the diurnal motion of each is uniformly per∣formed
in the same time; and this circumstance
is an additional proof, that portions of different
densities were originally separated from the sun.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="106"/>
But the obliquity of the stroke might be so
great as to throw off small quantities of matter
from the principal planet, which would neces∣sarily
move in the same direction. These parts,
by mutual attraction, would reunite, according
to their densities, at different distances from the
planet, follow its course round the sun, and at
the same time revolve about the body of the
planet, nearly in the plane of its orbit. It is easy
to perceive that the portions we mean are the
satellites: Thus the formation, position, and
motion of the satellites correspond, in the most
perfect manner, with our theory; for they all
move in the same direction, and in concentric
circles round their principal planets, and nearly
in the plane of their orbits. All these common
effects, depending on an impulsive force, must
have proceeded from a common cause, which
was a projectile force communicated to them by
the same oblique stroke. This account of the
motion and formation of the satellites will be
strongly supported, if the other circumstances
and phaenomena attending them be duly weigh∣ed.
Those planets that are furnished with satel∣lites,
move quickest round their axes. The re∣volution
of the earth is quicker than that of Mars,
in the proportion nearly of 24 to 15; the earth
has a satellite, and Mars has none; Jupiter;
whose diurnal motion is 500 or 600 times more
rapid than that of the earth, has four satellites;
and it is extremely probable, that Saturn, who
<PB N="82" REF="107"/>
has five satellites and a ring, revolves much more
quickly than Jupiter.</P>
<P>We may even conjecture, with some proba∣bility,
that the plane of the equator of Saturn's
ring is nearly the same with that of the planet;
for, supposing, according to the preceding theory,
the obliquity of the impulse which put Saturn
in motion to have been very great, his diurnal
motion would at first be in proportion to the
excess of the centrifugal force above that of gra∣vity,
and, of course, a considerable quantity of
matter would be thrown off from his equatorial
regions, and necessarily assume the figure of a
ring, the plane of which would be nearly the
same with that of his own equator. This quan∣tity
of matter detached from the equatorial re∣gions
of Saturn, must have flattened the equator
of that planet; which is the reason why, not∣withstanding
the rapidity with which we have
supposed him to revolve round his axis, the di∣ameters
of Saturn are not so unequal as those of
Jupiter, which differ from each other more than
an eleventh part.</P>
<P>Though this theory of the formation of the
planets and their satellites appears to be extreme∣ly
probable; yet, as every man has his own
standard of estimating probabilities of this na∣ture,
and as this standard varies according to the
different capacities of combining analogies more
or less remote, I pretend not to convince those
who are unwilling to believe. I have offered those
<PB N="83" REF="108"/>
ideas to the public, not only because I thought
them rational, and calculated to unravel a sub∣ject
upon which, however important, nothing
has hitherto been written; but because the im∣pulsive
motion of the planets gives rise to num∣berless
phaenomena in the universe, which ad∣mit
not of an explanation by gravity alone. To
those who may be disposed to deny the possibi∣lity
of my theory, I would propose the follow∣ing
queries:</P>
<P>1. Is it not natural to imagine, that a moving
body has received its motion from the impulse
of some other body?</P>
<P>2. When several bodies move in the same di∣rection,
is it not exceedingly probable, that they
received this direction from a single stroke, or,
at least, from strokes every way similar?</P>
<P>3. When several bodies in motion have not
only the same direction, but are placed in the
same plane, is it not more natural to think that
they received this direction and position from
one impulse than from many?</P>
<P>4. Is it not probable, that a body put in mo∣tion
by impulse, should receive it in an oblique
direction; and consequently that it should be
forced to move round its axis with a rapidity
proportioned to the obliquity of the stroke? If
these queries be not unreasonable, the theory of
which we have given a sketch will no longer
have the appearance of absurdity.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="109"/>
Let us now proceed to a more interesting ob∣ject;
let us examine the figure of the earth,
upon which so many inquiries and observations
have been made. As it appears, from the e∣quality
of the earth's diurnal motion, and the
uniformity in the inclination of its axis, that it
is composed of homogeneous parts which mu∣tually
attract each other in proportion to their
quantities of matter; if its impulsive motion
had been communicated in a direction perpen∣dicular
to its surface, it would necessarily have
assumed the figure of a perfect sphere: But,
having been struck obliquely, it moved round
its axis at the instant it received its figure; and,
from the combination of the projectile force and
that of attraction, there resulted a spheroid fi∣gure,
more elevated at the equator than at the
poles; because the centrifugal force, arising from
the diurnal rotation of the earth, must diminish
the action of gravity, or that power which makes
all the parts tend to the centre. Thus the earth,
being composed of homogeneous parts, and ha∣ving
been endowed with a rotatory motion,
must necessarily have assumed a spheroidal
figure, the two axes of which differ from each
other by a 230th part. To show that this is the
real figure of the earth, we need not have re∣course
to hypotheses; it is capable of the clear∣est
demonstration. The laws of gravitation are
well known: That bodies attract each other di∣rectly
<PB N="85" REF="110"/>
as their quantities of matter, and inverse∣ly
as the squares of their distances, admits not
of a doubt. It can as little be doubted, that the
total action of any body is composed of all the
particular actions of its parts.</P>
<P>The parts of bodies are all mutually attracted
in the above proportion; and all these attractions,
when the body has no rotation, necessarily pro∣duce
a sphere, and a spheroid, when the body is
endowed with a rotatory motion. This spheroid is
more or less flattened at the poles in proportion
to the quickness of its diurnal motion; and the
earth, in consequence of the celerity of its ro∣tation,
and the mutual attraction of its parts,
has assumed the figure of a spheroid, of which
the two axes are to one another as 229 to 230.</P>
<P>Thus the earth, at the time of its formation,
from the original constitution and homogeneity
of its parts, and independent of every hypothe∣sis
derived from the direction of gravity, took
the figure of a spheroid; and, from the known
laws of mechanics, its equatorial diameter was
necessarily elevated about six leagues and a half
more than its poles.</P>
<P>I shall dwell the longer on this article, be∣cause
there are some geometers, who, from a
system of philosophy they have adopted, and
from a supposed direction of gravity, still ima∣gine
that the figure of the earth depends upon
theory. The first thing to be demonstrated is
<PB N="86" REF="111"/>
the mutual attraction of the parts of matter;
and the second, the homogeneity of the terrestri∣al
globe. When these two facts are clearly pro∣ved,
there will be no occasion to have recourse
to any theory derived from the direction of
gravity; because the earth's figure, in this case,
must necessarily be as Newton determined it;
and all the other figures assigned to it in conse∣quence
of vortexes, and other hypotheses, can
have no existence.</P>
<P>It will not be doubted, even by the most in∣credulous,
that the planets are retained in their
orbits by the power of gravity. The satellites
of Saturn gravitate towards that planet, those of
Jupiter towards Jupiter; the moon gravitates
towards the earth; and Saturn, Jupiter, Mars,
the Earth, Venus, and Mercury, gravitate to∣wards
the sun. In the same manner, Saturn,
Jupiter, and the Earth, gravitate towards their
respective satellites, and the sun gravitates to∣wards
the whole planets. Gravitation is there∣fore
a general law, by which the whole planetary
system is mutually affected; for action cannot
exist without re-action. This mutual attraction
of the planets is the law which regulates all their
motions; and its existence is demonstrated by its
effects. When Saturn and Jupiter are in con∣junction,
their mutual attraction produces an
irregularity in their motion round the sun. The
earth and the moon, also, mutually attract each
other; But the irregularities in the moon's mo∣tion
<PB N="87" REF="112"/>
proceed principally from the attraction of
the sun; and hence the sun, the earth, and the
moon, mutually act upon each other. Now, the
reciprocal attraction of the planets, when the
distances are equal, is proportioned to their quan∣tities
of matter; and the same power of gravi∣ty,
which makes heavy bodies fall to the earth,
and which extends as far as the moon, is like∣wise
in proportion to the quantity of matter:
The total gravity of a planet, therefore, is com∣posed
of the gravity of all its parts: Hence all
the parts of matter, whether in the earth or pla∣nets,
mutually attract each other; and, of course,
the rotation of the earth round its axis must
necessarily have bestowed on it the figure of a
spheroid, the axes of which are are as 229 to 230.
But the direction of gravity must be perpendicular
to the earth's surface; and, consequently, unless
the general and mutual attraction of the parts
of matter be denied, no hypothesis derived from
the direction of gravity can have any solid foun∣dation.
But this mutual attraction, as we have
seen, is demonstrated by actual observation;
and the experiments made by pendulums prove
its universal extension. No hypothesis, there∣fore,
founded on the direction of gravity, can
be admitted, without contradicting both reason
and experience.</P>
<P>Let us now examine whether the parts com∣posing
the terrestrial globe be homogeneous. I
acknowledge, that, if the globe be supposed to
<PB N="88" REF="113"/>
consist of parts different in density, the direction
of gravity would be different from that we have
assigned, and that the earth's figure would vary
according to the different suppositions that might
be made concerning the direction of gravity.
But, why make suppositions of this kind? Why,
for example, do we suppose the parts near the
center to be more dense than those more distant
from it? Are not all the particles which compose
the globe united by their mutual attraction?
Every particle, therefore, is a centre; and there
is no reason to believe that the parts which sur∣round
the centre are denser than those which
surround any other point. Besides, if any con∣siderable
part of the earth were more dense than
another, the axis of rotation would approach
nearer that part, and create an inequality in the
diurnal revolution of the globe: It would pro∣duce
an inequality in the apparent motion of the
fixed stars; they would appear to move more
quickly or slowly in the zenith or horizon, ac∣cording
as we happened to be situated on the
heavy or light parts of the earth; and the axis
of the globe not passing through its centre of
gravity, would make a perceptible change in its
position. But nothing of this kind ever takes
place. On the contrary, the diurnal revolution
of the earth is equal and uniform. At every
point of the earth's surface, the stars appear to
move with the same quicknes and, if there be
any rotation in its axis, it is too inconsiderable
<PB N="89" REF="114"/>
to attract observation. Hence it may be con∣cluded,
that all the parts of the globe are at least
nearly homogeneous.</P>
<P>If the earth were hollow, the crust of which,
for example, exceeded not three leagues in thick∣ness,
it would give rise to the following phae∣nomena.
1. The mountains would bear so
great a proportion to the total thickness of the
crust, that vast irregularities in the earth's mo∣tion
would be occasioned by the attraction of
the moon and of the sun: When the moon was
in the meridian of the more elevated parts, as
the Cordeliers, her attraction upon the whole
globe would be much greater, than when she
was in the meridian of the lower parts. 2. The
comparative attraction of the mountains would
be greatly increased; and the experiments made
on Mount Chimboraco in Peru, would have gi∣ven
more degrees in the deviation of the plumb
line than they actually gave seconds. 3. The
weight of bodies would be greater on the tops
of mountains than in the plains; and men would
find themselves more weighty, and would walk
with more difficulty in high than in low grounds.
These observations, and many others that might
be made, should convince us, that the interior
parts of the earth are not hollow, but that they
are composed of matter of a considerable den∣sity.</P>
<P>If, on the other hand, the earth, at the depth
of two or three leagues, consisted of matter
<PB N="90" REF="115"/>
much denser than that we are acquainted with,
upon descending even into ordinary pits, we should
find ourselves considerably heavier; and the
motion of pendulums would there be more ac∣celerated
than they actually are when brought
down from a hill to a plain. Hence we may
presume, that the interior parts of the earth con∣sist
of matter nearly similar to that on its sur∣face.
Of this, we will be still further convinced,
if we consider, that the earth, at the time of its
original formation, when it assumed its present
spheroidal figure, was in a state of fusion, and,
consequently, that all its parts were homogeneous,
and nearly of equal density. The matter on
the surface, though originally the same with that
of the interior parts, has, in the revolutions of
time, undergone many changes from external
causes; and to these are to be ascribed the pro∣duction
of materials so different in their densi∣ties.
But it ought to be remarked, that the
densest bodies, as gold, and other metals, are
most rarely to be met with; and, consequently,
that the greatest quantity of materials, at the
surface, have suffered little alteration with re∣gard
to density. The most common materials,
indeed, as sand and clay, differ so little in densi∣ty,
that we may conjecture, with much proba∣bility,
the internal parts of the earth to consist
of a vitrified matter, the density of which is
nearly equal to that of sand; and, consequently,
<PB N="91" REF="116"/>
that the whole globe may be considered as one
homogeneous mass.</P>
<P>But, it may be said, that, though the earth
were composed of concentric beds, of different
densities, the equality of its diurnal motion, and
the uniform inclination of its axis, would re∣main
equally undisturbed, as upon the supposi∣tion
of its consisting wholly of homogeneous
matter. This I allow; but I demand, at the
same time, whether there be any reason for be∣lieving,
that these beds of different densities
really exist? Whether this method of solving
difficulties be not an attempt to adjust the works
of nature to our own imaginations? And whe∣ther
suppositions, neither founded on observation
nor analogy, ought to find admittance into phy∣sics?</P>
<P>It is, then, apparent, that the earth received
its spheroidal figure in consequence of its diurnal
motion, and the mutual attraction of its parts;
that this figure necessarily resulted from the
globe's being in a liquid state; that, according
to the laws of gravity and of a centrifugal force,
it could not possibly assume any other figure;
that, at the moment of its formation, the diffe∣rence
between its two diameters was, as at pre∣sent,
equal to a 230th part; and, of course, that
all other hypotheses which make this difference
greater or less, are mere fictions, and deserve no
attention.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="117"/>
Perhaps it may be objected, that, if this theo∣ry
be well founded, and if the proportion of the
axes of the two diameters be as 229 to 230,
how came the mathematicians sent to Lapland
and Peru to concur in making it as 174 to 175?
Why should such a difference subsist between
practice and theory? And, is it not more rea∣sonable
to give the preference to actual measure∣ment,
especially when executed by the ablest
mathematicians in Europe<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. de Maupertuis, figure de la terre.</NOTE>, and furnished with
all the necessary apparatus?</P>
<P>To this I reply, that I mean not to combat
the observations made at the equator, and near
the pole; that I doubt not of their exactness; and
that the earth may actually be elevated a 175th
part more at the equator than at the poles. Still,
however, I maintain my theory; and I perceive
clearly how it may be reconciled to practice.
The difference between the two conclusions is
about four leagues in the two axes. The equa∣torial
regions are found to have an elevation of
two leagues more than they ought to have by
the theory. This heighth of two leagues cor∣responds
exactly with the greatest inequalities
which have been produced on the surface of the
globe by the motion of the sea, and the action
of fluids. This requires illustration. At the
time of the earth's formation, in consequence of
the mutual attraction of its parts, and of its cen∣trifugal
force, it must have assumed a spheroidal
<PB N="93" REF="118"/>
figure, with its axes different by a 230th part.
This would be the real figure of the earth while
it remained in a state of liquifaction. But, af∣ter
cooling for some time, the rarified vapours,
like those in the tail or atmosphere of a comet,
would condense, and fall on the surface in the
form of air and water; and, when these waters
began to be agitated by a flux and reflux, sand,
and other bodies, would be gradually transported
from the poles towards the equatorial parts.
This operation, when continued for some time,
would necessarily sink the poles, and elevate the
equator in the same proportion. The surface of
the earth being likewise exposed to the winds,
to the action of the air and of the sun; all these
causes would concur with the tides in furrow∣ting
the earth, in scooping out vallies, in eleva∣ing
the mountains, and in producing other su∣perficial
irregularities, none of which, perhaps,
exceed a league in thickness, even at the equa∣tor.
This inequality of two leagues may be
supposed to be the greatest that can take place
on the surface; for the highest mountains ex∣ceed
not a league in height; and the most pro∣found
parts of the ocean, it is probable, are not
above a league in depth. Thus my theory per∣fectly
coincides with practice. The earth's e∣quator
could not, at first, be elevated more than
six leagues and a half above the poles; but the
changes produced on the surface might give it
a still greater elevation. Natural history won∣derfully
<PB N="94" REF="119"/>
supports this opinion; for, in the pre∣ceding
discourse, we have proved, that, from
the tides and other motions of the waters, have
proceeded mountains, and all the other inequa∣lities
on the surface of the globe; and that, at
great depths, as well as upon the greatest
heights, bones, shells, and other relicts of sea
and land animals, have been discovered.</P>
<P>From what has been observed, it may be con∣jectured,
that, in order to find primitive earth,
and substances which have never been removed
from their original stations, we must dig in
countries near the poles, where the bed of
unmoved earth will be thinner than in southern
climates.</P>
<P>In fine, if the measurement by which the fi∣gure
of the earth was determined be strictly
scrutinized, we shall find that it is not altogether
free from hypothetical reasoning: For it pro∣ceeded
on the supposition that the earth was a
regular curve: But, as the earth is liable to con∣siderable
and constant changes from a thousand
causes, it is impossible that it could have retained
any perfectly regular figure; and hence, agree∣able
to our theory, and the opinion of Newton,
the poles might originally be only flattened a
230th part. Besides, though we had the exact
length of a degree at the equator and polar
circle, yet, have we not likewise the exact length
of a degree in France? and the measures of M.
Picard have never been confirmed. It may be
<PB N="95" REF="120"/>
added, that the diminution and increase in the
motion of the pendulum agree not with the con∣clusions
drawn from measurement; and that, on
the contrary, they correspond very nearly to the
theory of Newton. These circumstances tend
farther to convince us, that the poles are not de∣pressed
above a 230th part; and that, if there
be any difference, it can proceed from nothing
but the inequalities produced on the surface by
the waters, and other external causes. But these
inequalities are by no means so regular as to
justify any hypothesis which supposes the meri∣dians
to be ellipses, or any other perfect curves.
Hence it appears, that, though many degrees
should be successively measured in different re∣gions,
we cannot, by that alone, ascertain the
exact depression of the poles, nor determine how
much it exceeds or falls short of a 230th part.</P>
<P>May we not likewise conjecture, that, if the
inclination of the earth's axis has been changed,
this effect could not be produced but by the
changes on the surface, since all the other parts
are homogeneous; that this variation is, of
course, too small to be perceived by astrono∣mers;
and that, if the earth be not disturbed by
a comet, or some other external cause, its axis
will for ever preserve its present and original
inclination?</P>
<P>Not to omit any conjecture that seems rea∣sonable,
may we not suppose, that, as the moun∣tains,
and other inequalities on the surface of
<PB N="96" REF="121"/>
the earth, have originated from the action of
the tides, those which we perceive in the moon
have been produced by a similar cause? The
mountains of the moon are indeed higher than
those of the earth; but her tides are likewise
stronger; because the earth, the size of which is
much larger, produces the tides of the moon
with superior force. This effect would be great∣ly
augmented, if the moon, like the earth, had
a quick diurnal motion. But, as the moon uni∣formly
presents the same face to the earth, the
tides are raised only in proportion to the mo∣tion
occasioned by her librations, which alter∣nately
expose to our view a small segment of
her other hemisphere. This cause, however,
must produce tides very different from those of
our seas; and their effects will, of course, be
much less considerable, than if the moon had
possessed a diurnal revolution round her axis,
equally quick as the rotation of the earth.</P>
<P>I should compose a volume equal to that of
Burnet or Whiston, were I to extend the ideas
presented by the above theory; and were I, in
imitation of the last mentioned author, to clothe
them in a geometrical dress, I might add consi∣derably
to their importance. But I have always
thought, that hypotheses, however probable, de∣serve
not to be treated so pompously; it is apt to
give them the air of quackery and imposition.</P>

THEORY OF THE EARTH.</HEAD>
<HEAD>ARTICLE II.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the System of Whiston<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See a new theory of the Earth by Will. Whiston, London 1708.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>THIS author begins his theory with a dis∣sertation
on the creation of the world.
He alledges, that the account given of it by
Moses is not properly understood; and that, in
inquiries of this kind, men, contenting them∣selves
with the most evident and superficial views,
give too little of their attention to nature, rea∣son,
and philosophy. The common notions,
he observes, concerning the six days work, are
false; and the description of Moses is not an
exact or philosophic account of the creation and
origin of the universe, but only an historical
<PB N="98" REF="123"/>
narrative of the formation of the terrestrial globe.
The earth, in his estimation, formerly existed in
Chaos, and, at the time mentioned by Moses, it
only received a form, situation, and consistence,
necessary for the habitation of mankind. I
shall not give a detail of Whiston's proofs, nor
enter upon a formal refutation of them; but
content myself with a short view of his theory,
which will show it to be contrary to the scrip∣tures,
and, of course, that his proofs must be
false. Besides, he treats this matter more like
a polemical divine than a philosopher.</P>
<P>Leaving these false principles, he proceeds to
some ingenious notions, which, though singu∣lar,
will not, to those who are influenced by the
enthusiasm of system, appear to be destitute of
probability. He tells us, that the antient Chaos,
from which the earth originated, was the at∣mosphere
of a comet; that the annual motion
of the earth began when it received its new
form; but that its diurnal motion commenced
not till the fall of Adam; that the Ecliptic cut
the tropic of Cancer in a point precisely oppo∣site
to Paradise, which was situated on the north∣west
frontier of Assyria; that, before the de∣luge,
the year began at the autumnal equinox,
and that the orbits of the earth and planets were
then perfect circles; that the deluge commen∣ced
on the 18th of November, in the year of
the Julian period 2365, or 2349 before Christ;
that, previous to the deluge, the solar and lunar
<PB N="99" REF="124"/>
year were the same, and consisted exactly of 360
days; that a comet, descending in the plane of
the ecliptic to its perihelion, on the very day that
the deluge began, made a near approach to the
earth; that there is a great heat in the bowels
of the earth, which is constantly expanding
from the centre to the circumference; that the
figure of the earth resembles an egg; that the
mountains are the lightest parts of the globe,
&amp;c. He then attributes to the deluge all the
changes the earth has undergone, blindly adopts
Woodward's theory, uses indiscriminately all
that author's remarks on the present state of the
earth; but assumes more the air of an original,
when he treats of its future condition. The
earth, says Mr Whiston, will be consumed by
sire; and its destruction will be preceded by
earthquakes, thunder, and hideous meteors; the
sun and moon will assume a dreadful aspect; the
heavens will seem to fall; and the whole earth
will be in flames. But, after the fire shall have
devoured every impurity of this globe, and vi∣trified
and rendered it transparent as the purest
crystal, the saints and spirits of the blessed shall
take possession of it, and there remain till the
general judgment.</P>
<P>This hypothesis appears, at first view, to be
extravagant and fantastical. But the author has
managed his ideas with such dexterity, and pla∣ced
them in so strong a light, that they no long∣er
have the air of absolute chimeras. He has
<PB N="100" REF="125"/>
adorned his subject with much science and in∣genuity:
And it is astonishing, that, from such
a medley of strange notions, he should have
been able to compose a system so plausible. But
it is not to the vulgar that it has this brilliant
appearance; the learned are more easily de∣ceived
by the glare of erudition, and the force
of new ideas. Mr Whiston was a celebrated a∣stronomer.
Accustomed to contemplate the hea∣vens,
to measure the motions of the stars, and to
consider the great phaenomena of nature, he
could never imagine, that this grain of sand,
which we inhabit, occupied more the attention
of its Creator than the universe, which contains,
in the vast regions of space, millions of other
suns and other worlds. He alledges, that Moses
has not given us the history of the first creation
of this globe, but only a detail of those circum∣stances
which attended its receiving a form fit
for the habitation of men, when the Almighty
transformed it from the state of a comet to that
of a planet. Comets, owing to the excentricity
of their orbits, are subject to dreadful vicissi∣tudes:
Sometimes, like that of 1680, they are
a thousand times hotter than melted iron, and
sometimes a thousand times more cold than ice:
They cannot, therefore, furnish habitation to
any creatures of which we can form a concep∣tion;
or rather, they are altogether uninhabi∣table.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="126"/>
The planets, on the contrary, are tranquil bo∣dies;
their distances from the sun vary but
little; and their temperature continues so nearly
the same, that it permits plants and animals to
grow and to multiply.</P>
<P>In the beginning, says Mr Whiston, God
created the universe; but the earth was then an
uninhabitable comet, and subject to such alter∣nate
extremes of cold and heat, that its matter,
being sometimes liquified and sometimes frozen,
was in the form of a chaos, or an abyss, sur∣rounded
with utter darkness: <HI>And darkness co∣vered
the face of the deep.</HI> This chaos was the
atmosphere of the comet, a body composed of
heterogeneous materials, having its centre oc∣cupied
with a globular, solid, hot nucleus of
about 2000 leagues in diameter, round which
was an extensive mass of a thick fluid, mixed
with heterogeneous and undigested materials,
like the chaos of the antients, <HI>rudis et indiges∣taque
moles.</HI> This great atmosphere contained
few dry, solid, or earthy particles, and still less
of water or air; but it was amply filled with
thick and heavy fluids, mixed, agitated, and
jumbled together in the utmost confusion. Such
was the condition of the earth when six days
old: But, next day, that is, on the first day of
the creation, when the excentric orbit of the
comet was changed into an ellipse, nearly cir∣cular,
every thing assumed its proper place; the
different materials arranged themselves accor∣ding
<PB N="102" REF="127"/>
to their specific gravities; the heavy fluids
sunk down, and left to the earthy, watery, and
aerial substances, the superior regions. These
also descended in the order of their gravities;
first the earth, then the water, and, lastly, the
air. In this manner, the immense volume of
chaos was reduced to a moderate sphere, the
center of which is a solid body that still retains
the heat it received from the sun, when former∣ly
the nucleus of a comet. This heat may easily
last 6000 years, since the comet 1680 would re∣quire
50,000 before it cooled. Round the so∣lid
and burning nucleus, at the center of the
earth, is placed the heavy fluid which descended
first, and formed the great abyss, upon which
the earth floats like a cork on quick-silver. But,
as the earthy parts were originally mixed with a
great body of water, they, in descending, drove
before them a part of this water, which was
consined there when the earth consolidated, and
formed a stratum concentric with the heavy
fluid that surrounds the nucleus. Thus, the
great abyss is composed of two concentric circles,
the interior being a heavy fluid, and the supe∣rior
water, upon which last the earth is imme∣diately
founded. From this admirable arrange∣ment,
produced by the atmosphere of a comet,
are to be deduced the theory of the earth, and
an explication of all its phaenomena.</P>
<P>After the atmosphere of the comet had been
freed from the solid and earthy particles, a pure
<PB N="103" REF="128"/>
air only remained, through which the rays of
the sun instantly penetrated, and produced light:
<HI>Let there be light</HI>; <HI>and there was light.</HI> The
vast columns or beds of which the earth is com∣posed,
being formed with so much precipitation,
is the reason why they differ so much in density;
the heavier sunk deeper into the abyss than the
lighter, and, of course, gave rise to mountains
and valleys: These inequalities, before the de∣luge,
were differently situated from what they
are at present. Instead of that vast valley which
contains the ocean, many small caverns were
dispersed over the globe, each of which contain∣ed
a part of the waters. The mountains were
then at greater distances, and formed not large
chains. But the earth was a thousand times
more fertile, and contained a thousand times
more inhabitants; and the life of man, and of
the other animals, was ten times longer, All
these effects were produced by the superior heat
of the central fire, which gave birth to a great∣er
number of plants and animals, and, at the
same time, bestowed on them a degree of vigour
that enabled them to exist long, and to multi∣ply
abundantly. But this heat had a miserable
effect upon the dispositions of men and other
animals: It augmented the passions, robbed man
of his innocence, and diminished the sagacity of
the brute creation. All creatures, excepting the
fishes, who inhabited a colder element, felt the
influence of the central heat, became vicious,
<PB N="104" REF="129"/>
and merited death. This universal death was
accordingly inflicted, on Wednesday the 28th
day of November, by a dreadful deluge, which
lasted 40 days and 40 nights, and was occa∣sined
by the tail of a comet meeting with the
earth, in returning from its perihelion.</P>
<P>The tail of a comet is the lightest part of its
atmosphere. It is a transparent and subtile va∣pour
raised by the heat of the sun from the bo∣dy
of the comet. This vapour, which is com∣posed
of aerial and watery particles extremely
rarified, follows the comet in its descent to its
perihelion, and goes before the comet in its
ascent, its situation being always opposite to the
sun, as if it had an affection for the shade, and
wished to avoid the scorching rays of the sun.
This column of a vapour is often of an im∣mense
extent; and its length always increases
in proportion as the comet approaches nearer
the sun. Now, as many comets descend below
the annual orbit of the earth, it is not surprising
that the earth should sometimes be involved in
this vapour. This dreadful event happened at
the time of the deluge. The tail of a comet, in
two hours, will discharge a quantity of water
equal to that contained in the whole ocean. In
fine, this tail is what Moses calls the cataracts
of heaven: <HI>And the cataracts of heaven were
opened.</HI> The globe of the earth, when it meets
with a comet's tail, must necessarily, in its pas∣sage
through this body of vapour, appropriate
<PB N="105" REF="130"/>
part of its materials. Every thing that comes
within the sphere of the earth's attraction must
fall upon it, and must fall in the form of va∣pour,
since the tail itself principally consists of
that element. In this manner, rain may come
from the heavens in such abundance, as to pro∣duce
an universal deluge, and to surmount the
tops of the highest mountains.</P>
<P>Our author, however, unwilling to go beyond
the letter of the sacred writings, does not ascribe
the deluge to this rain alone, which he has cho∣sen
to bring from so great a distance. He takes
advantage of water wherever he can find it:
The great abyss, as we have seen, contains a
considerable quantity. The earth, in its ap∣proach
towards the comet, would feel the force
of its attraction; the waters in the great abyss
would be so agitated with a motion similar to
that of the tides, as would necessarily break the
shell or crust in many places, and make the water
rush out upon the surface: <HI>And the fountains
of the abyss were opened.</HI></P>
<P>But how, it may be asked, was this vast col∣lection
of water, so liberally furnished by the
great abyss, and by the comet's tail, afterwards
disposed of? Our author is not embarrassed by
this circumstance. As soon as the earth escaped
from the comet, the flux and reflux of the great
abyss necessarily ceased. From that moment,
the waters on the surface rushed down with vio∣lence
by the same channels out of which they
<PB N="106" REF="131"/>
had issued. The great abyss swallowed up not
only its own water, but all that had been depo∣sited
by the comet, which it was sufficiently e∣nabled
to contain; because, during its agitation,
and when it broke the crust, it had greatly en∣larged
its dimensions, by pushing the earth far∣ther
from it on all sides. It was at this time
likewise, that the earth, which was formerly a
sphere, assumed its elliptical figure. This effect
was produced by the centrifugal force occasion∣ed
by the diurnal motion of the earth, and by
the attraction of the comet; for the earth, when
passing through the tail of the comet, was so si∣tuated,
that its equatorial parts were nearest that
star; and, of course, the power of the comet's
attraction, concurring with the earth's centrifu∣gal
force, elevated the equatorial regions with
the greater facility, because the crust was broken
in an infinite number of places, and because the
flux and reflux of the abyss pushed more vio∣lently
against the equator than any where else.</P>
<P>This is the history Mr Whiston gives of the
creation, of the causes of the universal deluge,
of the longevity of the Antedeluvians, and of
the figure of the earth. All these difficult sub∣jects
seem to have given our author very little
trouble. But he appears to be greatly puzzled
about Noah's ark. In that dreadful confusion
produced by the conjunction of the tail of a
comet, and by the waters of the great abyss,
and in that horrible period, when not only
<PB N="107" REF="132"/>
the elements of this globe were confounded,
but when the heavens concurred with the
bowels of the earth in producing new ele∣ments
to increase the chaos, how is it to be ima∣gined
that the ark could float tranquilly, with
its numerous and valuable cargo, upon the sur∣face
of the waves? Here our author struggles
hard, in order to account for the preservation of
the ark. But, as his reasoning, upon this sub∣ject,
appears to be inconclusive, ill-imagined,
and heterodox, I shall only observe how hard
it is for a man, who had explained objects so
great and surprising, without having recourse to
a supernatural power, to be stopped in his career
by a trifling circumstance. But he chuses to
risk drowning himself along with the ark,
rather than to ascribe the preservation of this
precious vessel to the interposition of the Al∣mighty!</P>
<P>I shall only make a single remark upon this
system, of which I have given a faithful abridge∣ment.
Whenever men are so presumptuous as
to attempt a physical explanation of theological
truths; whenever they allow themselves to in∣terpret
the sacred text by views purely human;
whenever they reason concerning the will of the
Deity, and the execution of his decrees; they
must necessarily involve themselves in obscurity,
and tumble into a chaos of confusion, like the
author of this whimsical system, which, notwith∣standing
<PB N="108" REF="133"/>
all its absurdities, has been received
with great applause. Mr Whiston neither doubt∣ed
of the truth of the deluge, nor of the au∣thenticity
of the sacred writings. But, as phy∣sics
and astronomy occupied his principal at∣tention,
he mistook passages of holy writ for
physical facts, and for results of astronomical
observation; and so strangely jumbled divinity
with human science, that he has given birth to
the most extraordinary system that perhaps ever
did or ever will appear.</P>

<P>MR Burnet is the first author who disco∣vered
enlarged views of the present sub∣ject,
and who treated it in a systematic manner.
He was a man of genius and of taste: His work
acquired great reputation, and was, of course,
criticised by many of the learned, and, among
others, by Mr Keill, who, scrutinizing the sub∣ject
as a geometer, demonstrated the errors of
Burnet's theory in a treatise entitled, <HI>An exami∣nation
of the Theory of the earth.</HI> Mr Keill
likewise refuted the system of Whiston; but he
treated the latter in a manner very different
from the former. He even appears, in many
particulars, to adopt the opinions of Whiston;
and considers the notion, that the deluge was
<PB N="110" REF="135"/>
occasioned by the tail of a comet, as exceeding∣ly
probable. But, to return to Burnet: His
book is equally written; he knows how to paint
the grandest images and the most magnificent
scenes. His plan is elevated; but, being defec∣tive
in proper materials, he often fails in the
execution. His reasonings and his proofs are
feeble; but the boldness with which he writes
makes the reader lose sight of all his imper∣fections.</P>
<P>He begins with alledging, that the earth, be∣fore
the deluge, was very different from what
it is now. It was at first, says he, a fluid mass,
composed of matters of every species, and of all
kinds of figures, the heaviest of which descend∣ed
to the centre, and there formed a hard and
solid body. The waters took their station round
this body; and all lighter fluids rose above the
water. Thus, between the coat of air, and that
of water, was interposed a coat of oily matter.
But, as the air was then full of impurities, and
contained great quantities of earthy particles,
these gradually subsided upon the coat or stra∣tum
of oil, and formed a crust composed of
earth and oil: This crust was the first habitable
part of the earth, and the first abode of man
and other animals. This land was light, fat,
and adapted to foster the tenderness of the ori∣ginal
germs. The surface of the earth was level
and uniform, without mountains, seas, or other
inequalities. But it remained in this stare about
<PB N="111" REF="136"/>
sixteen centuries only; for the heat of the sun
gradually drying the crust, produced, at first,
only superficial fissures or cracks; but, in pro∣cess
of time, these fissures penetrated deeper, and
increased so much in their dimensions, that, at
last, they entirely perforated the crust. In an
instant, the whole earth spilt in pieces, and fell
into the great abyss of waters which it formerly
surrounded. This great event was the univer∣sal
deluge.</P>
<P>But all these masses of earth, in falling into
the abyss, carried along with them vast quanti∣ties
of air, and they dashed against each other,
and accumulated and divided so irregularly, that
great cavities filled with air were left between
them. The waters gradually opened passages
into these cavities, and, in proportion as the ca∣vities
were filled with the water, the surface of
the earth began to discover itself in the most e∣levated
places; and, at last, the waters appeared
no where but in those extensive valleys which
contain the ocean. Thus our ocean is a part of
the antient abyss; the rest of it remains in the
internal cavities, with which the sea has still a
communication. Islands and sea-rocks are the
small fragments, and continents are the large
masses of the antient crust. As both the rupture
and fall of this crust were effected in a sudden
and confused manner, it is not surprising that
the surface of the present earth should be full
<PB N="112" REF="137"/>
of mountains, gulfs, plains, and irregularities
of every kind.</P>
<P>This specimen is sufficient to give an idea of
Burnet's system. It is an elegant romance, a
book which may be read for amusement, but
which cannot convey any instruction. The au∣thor
was ignorant of the chief phaenomena of
the earth, and a man of no observation. He
has drawn every thing from imagination, which
often acts against both truth and reason.</P>

OF THE
THEORY OF THE EARTH.</HEAD>
<HEAD>ARTICLE IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the System of Woodward<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An Essay towards the Natural History of the Earth, by John Woodward.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>OF this author, it may be said, that he want∣ed
to build an immense edifice upon a
foundation less firm than sand, and to construct
a world with dust; for he asserts, that the earth,
at the time of the deluge, suffered a total disso∣lution.
In perusing his book, the first idea that
presents itself is, that this dissolution was effected
by the waters of the great abyss. He alledges,
that, at the command of God, the abyss sudden∣ly
opened, and diffused such an enormous quan∣tity
of water on the surface, as was sufficient
to cover the tops of the highest mountains; and
<PB N="114" REF="139"/>
that God suspended the law of cohesion, which
instantly reduced every solid substance into a
powder, &amp;c. He did not consider, that, by
these suppositions, he added to the miracle of
the universal deluge many other miracles, or,
at least, physical impossibilities, which accord
neither with the scriptures, nor with the prin∣ciples
of mathematics and of natural philosophy.
But, as this author has the merit of collecting
many important observations, and, as he knew
better than any former writer the materials of
which the globe is composed, his system, though
ill conceived, and worse arranged, by the lustre
of a few striking facts, has seduced many weak
men into a belief of his general conclusions.</P>
<P>We shall now give a short view of his theo∣ry,
by which we will be enabled to do justice to
the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the author, and put the reader in
a condition of judging of the futility of his sys∣tem,
and of the falshood of some of his remarks.
Mr Woodward informs us, that he recognised
with his own eyes all the materials of which
the earth in England is composed, from the sur∣face
to the greatest depths that had been dug;
that they were all disposed in beds, or strata;
and that, in many of these beds, there are shells
and other productions of the sea. He then
adds, that he was assured by his friends and cor∣respondents,
that, in all the other countries of the
world, the earth was composed of the same ma∣terials;
and that shells are found, not only in the
<PB N="115" REF="140"/>
plains, and in some particular parts, but on the
highest mountains, in the deepest pits, and in an
infinite number of different places. He observed,
that the beds were all horizontal, and placed
over each other, like matters transported by the
waters, and deposited in the form of sediment.
These general remarks, which are founded in
truth, are followed with some particular obser∣vations,
by which he demonstrates, that the fos∣sil
shells incorporated with the strata are real
sea-shells, and not peculiar minerals, <HI>lusus natu∣rae,</HI>
&amp;c.</P>
<P>To these observations, though partly made
before him, he has added others of a more sus∣picious
nature. He asserts, that the materials of
the different strata are arranged according to
their specific gravities. This assertion is not
consistent with truth. We every day see solid
rocks placed above clay, sand, pit-coal, bitumen,
which have unquestionably a greater specific gra∣vity
than the latter materials. If, indeed, it
were uniformly found, through the whole earth,
that the upper stratum was bitumen, followed
successively by strata of chalk, marle, clay, sand,
stone, marble, and metals, it would, in that case,
be probable that all those materials had been
precipitated at once: And this our author affirms
with confidence, though the most superficial ob∣server
needs only his eyes to convince him, that
heavy strata are often found above light ones;
and, consequently, that these sediments could
not be deposited at the same time, but must have
<PB N="116" REF="141"/>
been transported and dropped by the ocean at
successive periods. As this is the foundation
of Woodward's system, and is manifestly false,
we shall follow him no farther than to show
how an erroneous principle produces false rela∣tions,
and bad conclusions.</P>
<P>All the strata that compose the earth, says our
author, from the tops of the highest mountains
to the deepest mines, are placed according to
their respective specific gravities. Hence, he con∣cludes,
the whole must have been in a state
of dissolution, and precipitated at the same
time. But at what time, in what menstruum,
was it dissolved? In the water, says Mr Wood∣ward,
and at the time of the deluge. But there
is not water enough on the globe to produce
this effect; for there is more land than water,
and the bottom of the sea itself is earth. Very
well, he replies; but there is enough of water in
the central parts of the earth; and nothing more
was wanting than to bestow on it the power
of dissolving every terrestrial substance, except∣ing
sea-shells; to find a proper method of ma∣king
the waters return to the abyss; and to
make all this correspond with the history of the
deluge. Behold a system, of which the author
could not prevail on himself to form a doubt;
for, when it was objected to him, that water
could not dissolve marble, rocks, and metals, e∣specially
in 40 days, the time of the waters re∣maining
on the earth; he replied simply, that
the event, however, did happen. When it was
<PB N="117" REF="142"/>
demanded of him, how the waters of the abyss
could dissolve the whole earth, and yet preserve
the shells? He answered, that he never proved
that this water was a dissolvent; but that, from
facts, it was clear that the earth had been dis∣solved,
and that the shells were preserved. Last∣ly,
When it was demonstrated to him, that his
system was useless, as it was neither supported
by reason nor by facts; he said, we had only to
suppose, that, at the time of the deluge, the laws
of gravity and of cohesion were suddenly stop∣ped,
and, upon this supposition, the dissolution
of the antient world admitted of an easy expla∣nation.
But, it was observed to him, if the force
of cohesion was suspended, Why were not the
shells dissolved along with the rest? Here he
gave a harangue on the organization of shells
and of animal bones, tending to prove that their
texture was fibrous, and different from that of
minerals; that their cohesion was likewise dif∣ferent;
and that, after all, we have only to sup∣pose
that the powers of gravity and of cohesion
did not entirely cease, but that they were dimi∣nished
to such a degree, as enabled them to dis∣solve
the parts of minerals, but not those of ani∣mals.
I shall conclude with remarking, that
our author's philosophy was not equal to his ge∣nius
for observation; it is therefore unnecessary
to give a formal refutation of absurd notions, e∣specially
when they proceed upon conjectures
that are contrary both to the laws of probability
and of mechanics.</P>

<HEAD>PROOFS
OF THE
THEORY OF THE EARTH.</HEAD>
<HEAD>ARTICLE V.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Examination of some other Systems.</HEAD>
<P>THE three hypotheses just mentioned have
many things in common: They all agree
in this point, that, at the time of the deluge,
both the external and internal form of the earth
was changed: But none of these theorists con∣sidered,
that the earth, before the deluge, was
inhabited by the same species of men and ani∣mals;
and, consequently, that it must have been
nearly the same, both in figure and structure, as
it is at present. We are informed by the sacred
writings, that, before the deluge, there were ri∣vers,
seas, mountains, and forests; that most of
these mountains and rivers remained nearly in
their former situation; the Tigris and Euphrates,
<PB N="119" REF="144"/>
for example, ran through Paradise; that the Ar∣menian
mountain on which the ark rested was,
at the deluge, one of the highest mountains of
the earth, as it is at this day; and that the same
plants and the same animals which inhabited
the earth before the deluge, continue still to ex∣ist;
for we are told of the serpent, of the crow,
and of the pigeon that carried the olive branch
into the ark. Tournefort indeed alledges, that
there are no olives within 400 leagues of Mount
Araret, and affects to be witty on this head. It
is, however, indisputable, that there were olives
in the neighbourhood of this mountain at the
time of the deluge; for Moses assures us of the
fact in the most express manner. Besides, it is
not surprising, that, in the course of 4000 years,
the olives should be extirpated in these provin∣ces,
and multiplied in others. It is, therefore,
contrary both to scripture and reason, that these
authors have supposed the earth, before the de∣luge,
to have been totally different from what it
is now; and this opposition between their hy∣potheses
and the sacred writings, as well as sound
philosophy, is sufficient to discredit their systems,
although they should correspond with some phae∣nomena<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Voyage du Levant, vol. 2. p. 336.</NOTE>.
Burnet, who wrote first, gives nei∣ther
facts nor observations in support of his
system. Woodward's book is only a short es∣say,
in which he promises much more than he
was able to perform; it is only a project, with∣out
any degree of execution. He makes use of
<PB N="120" REF="145"/>
two general remarks, 1. That the earth is every
where composed of materials which had for∣merly
been in a state of fluidity, and which had
been deposited by the waters in horizontal beds.
2. That, in the bowels of many parts of the
earth, there are an infinite number of sea-bodies.
To account for these facts, he was recourse to
the universal deluge; or rather, he appears to
employ these as proofs of the deluge. But, like
Burnet, he falls into evident contradictions; for
it is absurd to suppose, with these authors, that,
before the deluge, there were no mountains,
since we are expressly told, that the waters rose
15 cubits above the tops of the highest moun∣tains.
On the other hand, it is not said, that
the waters destroyed or dissolved the mountains.
In place of this extraordinary dissolution, the
mountains remained firm in their original si∣tuations,
and the ark rested upon the one which
was first deserted by the waters. Besides, it is
impossible to imagine, that, during the short
time the deluge continued, the waters could dis∣solve
the mountains, and the whole fabric of the
earth. Is it not absurd to suppose, that, in the
space of forty days, the hardest rocks and mine∣rals
were dissolved by simple water? Is it not
a manifest contradiction to admit this total dis∣solution,
and yet to maintain that shells, bones,
and other productions of the sea, were able to
resist a menstruum, to which the most solid ma∣terials
had yielded? Upon the whole, I cannot
<PB N="121" REF="146"/>
hesitate in pronouncing, that Woodward, though
furnished with excellent facts and observations,
has produced but a weak and inconsistent theo∣ry.</P>
<P>Whiston, who wrote last, has greatly im∣proved
upon the other two; and, though he
has given loose reins to his imagination, it can∣not
be said that he falls into contradiction. He
advances many things that are incredible; but
they are neither absolutely nor apparently im∣possible.
As we are ignorant of what materials
the centre of the earth is composed, he thinks
himself entitled to suppose it a solid nucleus,
surrounded with a ring of heavy fluid matter,
and then follows a ring of water, upon which
the external crust is supported. In this ring of
water, the different parts of the crust sunk more
or less in proportion to their gravities, and gave
rise to mountains and inequalities on the surface
of the earth. But our astronomer here commits
a blunder in mechanics. He considered not,
that the earth, on this supposition, must have
formed one uniform arch; and, consequently,
that it could not be supported by the water, and
far less could any part of this arch sink deeper
than another. If this be excepted, I doubt whe∣ther
he has fallen into any other physical blunder:
He has, however, committed many errors both
in metaphysics and theology. In fine, it cannot
be denied absolutely, that the earth, in meeting
with the tail of a comet, would be deluged, e∣specially
<PB N="122" REF="147"/>
if it be allowed to the author, that the
tails of comets contain watery vapours. Neither
is it absolutely impossible, that the tail of a co∣met,
in returning from its perihelion, should
burn the earth, if we suppose, with Mr Whiston,
that the comet passed very near the sun's body.
The same observations may be made upon the
rest of his system. But, though his notions be
not absolutely impossible, when taken separate∣ly,
they are so exceedingly improbable, that the
whole assemblage may be regarded as exceeding
the bounds of human credulity.</P>
<P>These three are not the only books that have
been written upon the theory of the earth. In
1729, M. Bourguet published, along with his
<HI>Philosophical Letters on the formation of Salts, &amp;c.</HI>
a memoir, in which he gives a specimen of a
system which he had projected; but the execu∣tion
of it was prevented by the death of the au∣thor.
It must be acknowledged, that no man
was more industrious and acute in making ob∣servations,
and in collecting facts. To him we
are indebted for remarking the correspondence
between the angles of mountains, which is the
chief key to the theory of the earth. He ar∣ranges
the materials he had collected in the best
order. But, with all these advantages, it is pro∣bable,
that he would not have succeeded in gi∣ving
a physical history of the changes that have
happened in the earth; and he appears not to
have discovered the causes of those effects which
<PB N="123" REF="148"/>
he relates. To be convinced of this, we have
only to take a view of the propositions he de∣duces
from those phaenomena which behoved
to be the foundation of his theory. He says,
that the earth was formed at once, and not suc∣cessively;
that its figure and disposition demon∣strate
that it was formerly in a fluid state; that
the present condition of the earth is very differ∣ent
from what it was some ages after its first
formation; that the matter of the globe was
originally more soft than after its surface was
changed; that the condensation of its solid parts
diminished gradually with its velocity; so that,
after a certain number of revolutions round its
own axis, and round the sun, its original struc∣ture
was suddenly dissolved; that this happened
at the vernal equinox; that the sea-shells insi∣nuated
themselves into the dissolved matters;
that the earth, after this dissolution, assumed its
present form; and that, as soon as the fire or
heat operated upon it, its consumption gradually
began, and, at some future period, it will be
blown up with a dreadful explosion, accompa∣nied
with a general conflagration, which will
augment the atmosphere, and diminish the dia∣meter
of the globe; and then the earth, in place
of strata of sand or clay, will consist only of
beds of calcined materials, and mountains com∣posed
of amalgams of different metals.</P>
<P>This is a sufficient view of the system which
M. Bourguet designed to compose. To guess at
<PB N="124" REF="149"/>
the past, and to predict the future, nearly in the
same manner as others have guessed and predic∣ted,
requires but a small effort of genius. This
author had more erudition than sound and ge∣neral
ideas. He appears not to have had the
capacity of forming enlarged views, or of com∣prehending
the chain of causes and effects.</P>
<P>In the Leipsic Transactions, the celebrated
Leibnitz published a sketch of an opposite sy∣stem,
under the title of Protogaea. The earth,
according to Bourguet and others, was to be
consumed by fire. But Leibnitz maintains, that
it originated from fire, and that it has under∣gone
innumerable changes and revolutions. At
the time that Moses tells us the light was divi∣ded
from the darkness, the greatest part of the
earth was in flames. The planets, as well as the
earth, were originally fixed and luminous stars.
After burning for many ages, he alledges, that
they were extinguished from a deficiency of
combustible matter, and that they became o∣paque
bodies. The fire, by melting the matter,
produced a vitrified crust; and the basis of all
terrestrial bodies is glass, of which sand and gra∣vel
are only the fragments. The other species
of earth resulted from a mixture of sand with
water and fixed salts; and, when the crust had
cooled, the moist particles, which had been ele∣vated
in the form of vapour, fell down, and
formed the ocean. These waters at first cover∣ed
the whole surface, and even overtopped the
<PB N="125" REF="150"/>
highest mountains. In the estimation of this
author, the shells, and other spoils of the ocean,
which every where abound, are indelible proofs
that the earth was formerly covered with the
sea; and the great quantity of fixed salts, of
sand, and of other melted and calcined matters
shut up in the bowels of the earth, demonstrate,
that the conflagration had been general, and that
it had preceded the existence of the ocean.
These ideas, though destitute of evidence, are
elevated, and bear conspicuous marks of inge∣nuity.
The thoughts have a connection, the hy∣potheses
are not impossible, and the consequen∣ces
that might be drawn from them are not con∣tradictory.
But the great defect of this theory
is, that it applies not to the present state of the
earth. It only explains what passed in ages so
remote, that few vestiges remain; a man may,
therefore, affirm what he pleases, and what he
says will be accompanied with more or less pro∣bability,
in proportion to the extent of his ta∣lents.
To maintain, with Whiston, that the
earth was originally a comet, or with Leibnitz,
that it was a fun, is to assert what is equally
possible or impossible; it would, therefore, be
ridiculous to investigate either by the laws of
probability. The instantaneousness of the cre∣ation
destroys the notion of the globe's being
covered with the ocean, and of that being the
reason why sea-shells are so much diffused
through different parts of the earth; for, if that
<PB N="126" REF="151"/>
had been the case, it must of necessity be allow∣ed,
that shells, and other productions of the o∣cean,
which are still found in the bowels of the
earth, were created long prior to man, and other
land-animals. Now, independent of scripture-authority,
is it not reasonable to think that the
origin of all kinds of animals and vegetables is
equally antient?</P>
<P>M. Scheutzer, in a dissertation addressed to
the Academy of Sciences in 1708, attributes,
like Woodward, the change, or rather new cre∣ation
of the globe, to the deluge. To account
for the formation of mountains, he tells us, that
God, when he ordered the waters to return to
their subterraneous abodes, broke, with his Al∣mighty
hand, many of the horizontal strata, and
elevated them above the surface of the earth,
which was originally level. The whole disser∣tation
was composed with a view to support this
ridiculous opinion. As it was necessary that
these eminences should be of a solid consistence,
Mr Scheutzer remarks, that God only raised them
from places which abounded in stones. Hence,
says he, those countries, like Switzerland, which
are very stony, are likewise mountainous; and
those, like Flanders, Holland, Hungry, and Po∣land,
which are mostly composed of sand and
clay to great depths, have few or no moun∣tains<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Hist. de l'Acad, 1708, p. 32.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="152"/>
This author, like Woodward, blends physics
and theology; and, though he has made some
good observations, the systematic part of his
work is weaker and more puerile than that of
any of his predecessors. He has even descended
to declamation, and absurd pleasantries. The
reader, if he desires to see them, may con∣sult
his <HI>Piscium Quaerelae,</HI> &amp;c. not to mention
his <HI>Physica Sacra,</HI> in several volumes in folio, a
weak performance, fitter for the amusement of
children, than the instruction of men.</P>
<P>Steno, and some others, have attributed the
origin of mountains, and other inequalities, up∣on
the surface of the earth, to particular inun∣dations,
earthquakes, &amp;c. But the effects of
these secondary causes could produce nothing
but slight changes. These causes may co-ope∣rate
with the first cause, namely, the tides, and
the motion of the sea from east to west. Be∣sides,
Steno has given no theory, nor even any
general facts, upon this subject<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Dissert. de Solido intra Solidum nato, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Ray alledges, that all mountains have been
produced by earthquakes, and has written a
treatise to prove it. When we come to the ar∣ticle
of volcano's, we shall examine the foun∣dation
of this opinion.</P>
<P>We cannot omit observing here, that Burnet,
Whiston, Woodward, and most other authors,
have fallen into an error which deserves to be
rectified. They uniformly regard the deluge as
<PB N="128" REF="153"/>
an effect within the compass of natural causes,
although the scripture represents it as an imme∣diate
operation of the Deity. It is beyond the
power of any natural cause to produce on the
surface of the earth a quantity of water sufficient
to cover the highest mountains: And, although
a cause could be imagined adequate to this effect,
it would still be impossible to find another cause
capable of making the waters disappear. Grant∣ing
that Whiston's waters proceeded from the
tail of a comet, we deny that any of them could
issue from the abyss, or that the whole could re∣turn
into it; for the abyss, according to him, was
so environed, and pressed on all sides by the ter∣restrial
crust, that it was impossible the comet's at∣traction
could produce the least motion in the
fluids it contained, far less any motion resem∣bling
the tides: Hence, not a single drop could
either proceed from, or enter into the great
abyss. Unless, therefore, it be supposed, that
the waters which fell from the comet were an∣nihilated
by a miracle, they would for ever have
remained on the surface, and covered the tops
of the highest mountains. The impossibility of
explaining any effect by natural causes, is the
most essential character of a miracle. Our au∣thors
have made several vain efforts to account
for the deluge. Their errors in physics, and in
the secondary causes they employ, prove the
truth of the fact, as related in scripture, and de∣monstrate,
that the universal deluge could not be
<PB N="129" REF="154"/>
accomplished by any other cause than the will
of the Deity.</P>
<P>Besides, it is apparent, that it was not at one
time, nor by the sudden effect of a deluge
that the sea left uncovered those continents
which we inhabit: It is certain, from the au∣thority
of scripture, that the terrestrial Paradise
was in Asia, and that Asia was inhabited before
the deluge; consequently, the waters, at that
period, covered not this large portion of the
globe. The earth, before the deluge, was near∣ly
the same as now. This enormous quantity of
water, poured out by Divine justice upon guilty
men, destroyed every living creature; but it
produced no change on the surface of the earth;
it destroyed not even the plants which grew up∣on
it; for the pigeon returned to the ark with
an <HI>olive branch</HI> in her bill.</P>
<P>Why then should we suppose, with many na∣turalists,
that the waters of the deluge totally
changed the surface of the globe, even to the
depth of two thousand feet? Why imagine that
the deluge transported those shells which are
found at the depth of seven or eight hundred feet,
immersed in rocks and in marble? Why refer to
this event the formation of hills and mountains?
And how is it possible to imagine, that the wa∣ters
of the deluge transported banks of shells of
100 leagues in length? I perceive not how they
can persist in this opinion, unless they admit a
double miracle, one to create water, and ano∣ther
<PB N="130" REF="155"/>
to transport shells. But, as the first only is
supported by holy writ, I see no reason for ma∣king
the second an article of faith.</P>
<P>On the other hand, if the waters of the deluge
had retired suddenly, they would have transport∣ed
such immense quantities of mud and other
impurities, as would have rendered the land un∣sit
for culture till many ages after the inunda∣tion.
In the inundation which happened in
Greece, the country that was covered remained
barren for three centuries<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vida acta erudit. Lips. 1691, p. 100.</NOTE>. Thus the deluge
ought to be regarded as a supernatural mode of
chastifing the wickedness of men, not as an ef∣fect
proceeding from any natural cause. The
universal deluge was a miracle, both in its
cause and in its effects. It appears from the
sacred text, that the sole design of the deluge
was the destruction of men and other ani∣mals,
and that it changed not in any manner
the surface of the earth; for, after the retreat
of the waters, the mountains, and even the trees,
kept their former stations, and the land was suit∣ed
for the culture of vines and other fruits of
the earth. It might be asked, if the earth was
dissolved in the waters, or, if the waters were so
much agitated as to transport the shells of India
into Europe, how the fishes, which entered not
into the ark, were perserved?</P>
<P>The notion, that the shells were transported
and left upon the land by the deluge, is the ge∣neral
<PB N="131" REF="156"/>
opinion, or rather superstition, of natura∣lists.
Woodward, Scheutzer, and others, call
petrified shells the remains of the deluge; they
regard them as medals or monuments left us by
God of this dreadful catastrophe, that the me∣morial
of it might never be effaced among men.
Lastly, they have embraced this hypothesis with
so blind a veneration, that they are only anxious
to reconcile it with holy writ; and, in place of
deriving any light from observation and experi∣ence,
they wrap themselves up in the dark clouds
of physical theology, the obscurity and littleness
of which derogates from the simplicity and dig∣nity
of religion, and presents to the sceptic no∣thing
but a ridiculous medley of human conceits
and divine truths. To attempt an explanation
of the universal deluge and of its physical causes;
to pretend to give a detail of what passed during
this great revolution; to conjecture what effects
have resuited from it; to add facts to the sacred
writings, ad to draw consequences from these
interpolated facts; is not this a presumptuous
desire of scanning the power of the Almighty?
The natural wonders wrought by his beneficent
hand, in a uniform and regular manner, are al∣together
incomprehensible; his extraordinary
operations, or his miracles, ought, therefore, to
impress us with an awful astonishment, and a
silent respect.</P>
<P>It may still be urged, that as the universal de∣luge
is an established fact, is it not lawful to rea∣son
<PB N="132" REF="157"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>

<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/><PB N="132" REF="161"/>
upon its consequences? True. But you must
commence with acknowledging, that the deluge
could not possibly be the effect of any physical
cause, you must regard it as an immediate ef∣fect
of the divine will; you must content your∣self
with what is recorded in scripture; and you
must, above all, avoid bleding bad philosophy
with the purity of divine truth. After taking
these precautions, which a respect for the coun∣sels
of the Almighty requires, what remains for
examination upon the subject of the deluge?
Does the scared writings tell us that the moun∣tains
were formed by the deluge? They tell us the
reverse. Do they inform us, that the agitation
of the waters was so great, as to raise the shells
from the bottom of the ocean, and to disperse
them over the face of the earth? No: The ark
moved gently on the surface of the waters. Do
they tell us, that the earth suffered a total dis∣solution?
By no means. The narration of the
sacred historian is simple and true; that of na∣turalists
is fabuious and complicated.</P>

<HEAD>PROOFS
OF THE
THEORY OF THE EARTH.</HEAD>
<HEAD>ARTICLE VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Geography.</HEAD>
<P>THE surface of the earth, like that of Ju∣piter,
is not divided into alternate bands
or belts, parallel to the Aequator. It, on the
contrary, is divided, from one pole to the other,
into two belts of earth, and two of sea. The
first and principal belt is the antient Continent,
the greatest length of which is a line commen∣cing
at the most eastern point of the north of
Tartary, and extending from thence to the neigh∣bourhood
of the gulf of Linchidolin, where the
Russians fish whales; from thence to Tobolski;
from Tobolski to the Caspin sea; from the Cas∣pian
sea to Mecca; from Mecca to the western
part of the country inhabited by the Galli in


<PB N="134" REF="163"/>
Africa; from thence to Monoemuci, or Mono∣motapa;
and, lastly, to the Cape of Good Hope.
This line is about 3600 leagues in length, and
is never interrupted but by the Caspian and the
Red Sea, the breadth of which is inconsiderable,
and ought not to be regarded, especially when,
like our seasons, the whole surface of the globe
is divided only into four parts.</P>
<P>This greatest length of the Old Continent lies
in a diagonal line; for, if measured by a meri∣dian,
it will be found, that, from the northmost
point of Lapland to the Cape of Good Hope,
exceeds not 2500 leagues; and that this line,
though shorter, meets with greater interruptions
from the Baltic and Mediterranean. With re∣gard
to all other lines that could be drawn un∣der
the same meridians in the Old Continent,
they must still be less than those we have men∣tioned.
For example, from the most southern
point of the Island of Ceylon to the northern∣most
coast of Nova Zembla, is 1800 leagues. In
the same manner, if the continent be measured
by lines parallel to the equator, its greatest length,
without much interruption by seas, will be found
to stretch from Trefana, on the west coast of
Africa, to Ninpo, on the east coast of China,
which is about 2800 leagues. Another line may
begin near Brest, and extend to the coast of Chinese
Tartary, which will be nearly 2300 leagues.
From Bergen in Norway, to the coast of Kamt∣schatka,
is only 1800 leagues. All these lines
<PB REF="164"/>
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>Plate I. Map of the OLD CONTINENT exhibiting its greatest diametral length from the point of East Tartary to the Cape of Good Hope.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="135" REF="165"/>
are much shorter than the first. Thus the great∣est
length of the Old Continent extends from
the eastern point of Tartary to the Cape of Good
Hope, and is about 3600 leagues. <HI>See plate I.
of Geogr.</HI></P>
<P>This line may be considered as the middle of
the antient Continent; for, in measuring the
surface on each side of it, I find, that, on the
left, there are 2471092¾ square leagues; and,
on the right, there are 2469687, which is an
equality so surprising as to render it extremely
probable that this line, which is the longest, at
the same time really divides the contents of the
antient Continent.</P>
<P>The Old Continent, then, consists of about
4940780 square leagues, which is a fifth part of
the surface of the globe, and may be regarded
as a large belt of earth, with an inclination to
the equator of about 30 degrees.</P>
<P>The New Continent is another belt of earth,
the greatest length of which may be taken from
the mouth of the river Plata to the lake of the
Assiniboils. This line passes from the mouth
of the river Plata to lake Caracara; from
thence to Mataguais, Pocona, Zongo, Ma∣riana,
Morua, St Fe, and Carthagena; then it
passes through the gulf of Mexico, and Jamaica,
and Cuba; from thence along the peninsula of
Florida, through Apalache, Chicachas; and from
thence to St Louis, Fort le Sueur, and terminates
in the country bordering on lake Assiniboils, the
<PB N="136" REF="166"/>
extent of which is unknown. <HI>See plate II. of
Geogr.</HI></P>
<P>This line is only interrupted by the Gulf of
Mexico, (which may be considered as a Medi∣terranean
sea), is about 2500 leagues in length,
and divides the New Continent nearly into two
equal parts, that on the left containing 1069286⅚ leagues square, and that on the right 1070926 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>/12.
It is the middle of the belt of land called the
New Continent, and is likewise inclined to the
equator about 30 degrees, but in an opposite
direction; for that of the Old Continent ex∣tends
from the north-east to the south-west; but
that of the New Continent from north-west to
south-east. The superficial contents of the Old
and New Continents are about 7080993 square
leagues, which is not near a third part of the
surface of the globe, which contains 25,000,000
square leagues.</P>
<P>Of these lines, which divide both the Conti∣nents
into two equal parts, it may be remarked,
that they both terminate at the same degrees
of north and south latitude; and that the two
Continents make mutual advances, or projections,
exactly opposite to each other, viz. those on the
African coast, from the Canary isles to Guiney;
and those of America, from Guiana to the
mouth of the Rio-Janeiro.</P>
<P>It is, therefore, apparent, that the most antient
lands on the globe are those which extend from
200 to 250 leagues on each side of the two lines
<PB REF="167"/>
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>Plate II. Map of the NEW CONTINENT exhibiting its greatest diametral length from the River Plata to the Lake Assiniboils.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="137" REF="168"/>
above described. Agreeable to this idea, which
is founded on the observations already made, we
find, that, in the Old Continent, the most an∣tient
countries of Africa are those which stretch
from the Cape of Good Hope to the Red Sea
and Aegypt, and are about 500 leagues broad;
and, consequently, that the whole western coast
of Africa, from Guiney to the Straits of Gibral∣tar,
are new lands. In the same manner, if we
trace this line through Asia, and include an e∣qual
breadth, we shall find, that the most antient
countries are, the two Arabia's, Persia, Georgia,
Turcomania, a part of Independent Tartary,
Circassia, part of Muscovy, &amp;c.; and, of course,
that Europe, and perhaps also China and the
eastern part of Tartary, are comparatively new
countries.</P>
<P>In the New Continent, we shall likewise find,
that Terra Magellanica, the eastern part of Bra∣sil,
of the country of the Amazons, of Guiana,
and of Canada, are new lands when compared
with Tucuman, Peru, Terra Firma, the islands
in the Gulf of Mexico, Florida, the Missisippi,
and Mexico. To these observations may be add∣ed
two remarkable facts. The Old and New
Continents are nearly opposite to each other.
The Old Continent extends farther north of the
equator than south; but the New, farther south
than north. The centre of the Old Continent
lies in the 16th or 18th degree of north latitude;
and the centre of the New Continent lies in the
<PB N="138" REF="169"/>
16th or 18th degree of south latitude, as if they
were intended to counterbalance each other.
There is another singular analogy between the
two continents, though it appears to be more the
effect of accident than those just mentioned.
Both continents might be divided into two por∣tions,
which would be surrounded on all sides by
the sea, excepting the two small isthmus's of
Suez and Panama.</P>
<P>These general observations on the division of
the globe are the result of an attentive survey.
We shall not, upon this foundation, erect hy∣potheses,
or indulge in reasonings, which might
lead to false conclusions. But, as the division
of the globe has never hitherto been considered
under this point of view, I shall hazard a few
remarks. It is not a little singular, that the
longest line that can be drawn upon the two
continents should, at the same time, divide them
into two equal parts. It is not less remarkable,
that these two lines should commence and ter∣minate
at the same degrees of latitude, and have
the same inclination to the equator. These re∣lations
may lead to general conclusions, of which
we are still ignorant. We shall afterwards ex∣amine,
in detail, the inequalities in the figure of
the two continents, and shall only here remark,
that the most antient countries should be found
in the neighbourhood of the above lines, and
should, at the same time, have the highest ele∣vation;
and that the more recent lands should
<PB N="139" REF="170"/>
be most remote from them, and likewise lie
lower. Agreeable to this idea, the newest coun∣tries
in America would be the land of the Ama∣zons,
Guiana, and Canada. In examining the
map of these countries, we perceive that they
are every where divided by numberless lakes
and rivers, which is a still stronger indication of
their recent origin. On the other hand, Tucu∣man,
Peru, and Mexico, are high mountains,
and are situate near the line that divides the
continent; circumstances which seem to prove
the superior antiquity of these countries. Africa
is also extremely mountainous, and at the same
time very antient. In this part of the globe,
Aegypt, Barbary, and the western coast, as far
as Senegal, can only be considered as new lands.
Asia is perhaps the most antient of all countries,
especially Arabia, Persia, and Tartary. But the
inequalities of this great division of the globe,
as well as those of Europe, shall be treated in a
separate article. We shall only remark, in ge∣neral,
that Europe is a new country, as appears
from those universal traditions concerning mi∣grations
of different nations, and the origin of
arts and sciences. It is not long since Europe
was full of marshes and forests. But, in coun∣tries
antiently inhabited, there are few woods,
lakes, or marshes, a great deal of heath and
shrubs, and many high mountains, with dry and
barren tops; for men destroy woods, drain
marshes and lakes, and, in process of time, give
<PB N="140" REF="171"/>
an appearance to the face of the earth totally
different from that of uninhabited or newly
peopled countries.</P>
<P>A small portion of the globe only was known
to the antients. The whole of America, the
Artic circle, Terra Australis and Magellanica,
and a great part of the interior regions of Afri∣ca,
were unknown to them. They knew not
that the Torrid Zone was inhabited, although
they had sailed round Africa. About 2200
years ago, Neco King of Aegypt furnished some
vessels to the Phoenicians, who sailed down the
Red Sea, doubled the Cape of Good Hope, and
the third year after their departure they entered
the Mediterranean by the Straits of Gibraltar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Herodotus, lib. 4.</NOTE>.
The antients, notwithstanding, were totally ig∣norant
of the polarity of the loadstone, although
they knew its power of attracting iron; they
knew not the cause of the tides; and they were
uncertain whether the ocean surrounded the
globe. Some of them, indeed, suspected that it
might be so; but these conjectures were so ill
founded, that none of them ever dreamed of its
being possible to circumnavigate the earth. Ma∣gellan,
in the year 1519, was the first who at∣tempted
this great voyage; and he accomplish∣ed
it in 1124 days. Francis Drake, in the 1577,
was the second; and he performed it in 1056
days. Thomas Cavendish set out upon this
voyage in 1586, and finished it in 777 days.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="172"/>
These celebrated navigators were the first
who gave a physical demonstration of the sphe∣ricity
and extent of the circumference of the
earth. The antients, though they travelled
much, had no adequate idea of the extent of the
globe. They were equally ignorant of the
trade-winds, which are so useful in long voy∣ages.
Their limited knowledge in geography,
therefore, ought not to surprise us, especially when
it is considered, that, notwithstanding the many
advantages derived from the mathematical
sciences, and from the discoveries of navigators,
many points remain still undetermined, and vast
regions are yet undiscovered. Of the countries
in the neighbourhood of the south pole, we on∣ly
know that they exist, and that they are sepa∣rated
from the other continents by the ocean<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Captain Cooke, in his late voyage, has demonstrated, in the compleatest manner, that no continent exists near the south pole.</NOTE>.
Much, likewise, remains to be discovered con∣cerning
the lands near the north pole: And, it
is a subject of regret, that, for a century past,
the ardour for discovering new countries has
greatly abated. The nations of Europe seem,
and perhaps they are right, more disposed to in∣crease
the value of those countries they have al∣ready
discovered, than to conquer new ones.</P>
<P>The discovery, however, of the southern con∣tinent,
would be a grand object of curiosity,
and might be attended with the greatest advan∣tages.
A few of its coasts have been recogni∣sed;
but those navigators who have attempted
<PB N="142" REF="173"/>
the discovery, have been always prevented from
reaching land by large bodies of ice. The thick
fogs which infest those seas is another obstacle.
But, notwithstanding all these inconveniencies,
it is probable, that, by setting out from the Cape
of Good Hope at different seasons, part of this
new world might still be discovered.</P>
<P>But another method might, perhaps, be atten∣ded
with more success. To avoid the fogs and
the ice, the discovery might be attempted, by
departing from Baldivia, or some other port on
the coast of Chili, and traversiong the south sea
under the 50th degree of south latitude. This
navigation appears not to be hazardous; and it
is probable that it would be attended with the
discovery of new lands; for the regions about
the south pole, still unknown, are so extensive,
that they may be computed to be about a fourth
part of the globe; and consequently may con∣tain
a country as large as the whole of Europe,
Asia, and Africa.</P>
<P>While we remain ignorant of this part of the
earth, we cannot determine the proportion the
surface of the land bears to that of the ocean;
from what we do know, it appears that there is
more sea than land.</P>
<P>To acquire an idea of the vast quantity of
water in the ocean, we must suppose a medium
depth, for example, that of 200 fathoms, or the
sixth part of a league. Upon this supposition,
there is as much water in the ocean as would be
<PB N="143" REF="174"/>
sufficient to cover the whole globe to the depth
of 600 feet; or, if collected into one mass, it
would form a globe of 60 leagues in diameter.</P>
<P>It is alledged by navigatiors, that the latitudes
near the south pole are much colder than the
same latitudes towards the north. But this o∣pinion
seems to have no foundation. It seems
to have been adopted from the circumstance of
the ice appearing the latitudes where none is ever
found in the northern seas. But this effect may
be owing to some peculiar causes. After the
month of April, there is no ice on this side of
67 or 68 degrees of north latitude; and the sa∣vages
of Acadia and of Canada say, that, if the
ice be not melted in April, it indicates a cold and
rainy summer. The year 1725 was distinguish∣ed
by an almost perpetual rain; and in April,
the ice in the northern seas was not only not
melted at the 67th degree, but, on the 15th of
June, it was found in lat. 41 or 42<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See l'hist. de l'acad, anneé 1725.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Great quantities of floating ice appear in the
north seas, especially at considerable distances
from land. They come from the Tartarean sea
into that of Nova Zembla and other parts of the
Frozen ocean. I have been assured by people
worthy of credit, that an English Captain, call∣ed
Manson, instead of searching for a passage
to China between the northern lands, directed
his course straight to the pole till he arrived
within two degrees of it; and that, in this course,
<PB N="144" REF="175"/>
he found an open sea, and no ice; which is a
clear proof that the ice is always formed near
the land, and never in an extensive sea: For,
though it should be supposed, contrary to pro∣bability,
that the cold was so intense at the pole
as to freeze the surface of the sea, it is still in∣conceivable
how these enormous floating masses
could be formed, without being attached to the
land, from which they are again separated by
the heat of the sun. Two vessels sent by the
East India Company, in 1739, to discover land
in the south seas, found boards of ice in lat. 47
or 48; but they were not very distant from the
shore, which was in view, though the vessels
could not make their landing good<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See on this subject a Chart by M. Buache, 1739.</NOTE>. These
boards of ice must have been detached from the
lands in the neighbourhood of the south pole;
and it may be conjectured that they follow the
course of some large rivers in these unknown
regions, in the same manner as the Oby, the Je∣nisca,
and other great rivers which fall into the
north seas, carry down boards of ice, which shut
up, during the greatest part of the year, the straits
of Waigat, and render the sea of Tartary, by
this course, altogether inaccessible; while, be∣yond
Nova Zembla, and nearer the pole, where
there is little land and few rivers, boards of ice
are less frequent, and the sea is more navigable.
Hence, if any farther attempts be made to find
a passage to China and Japan by the north seas,
<PB N="145" REF="176"/>
it will, perhaps, be necessary to keep at a distance
from the land and the ice, to stear directly to∣wards
the pole, and to explore the most open
seas, where unquestionably there is little or no
ice: For it is well known, that salt water can
take on a greater degree of cold, without freezing,
than fresh water after it is congealed; conse∣quently,
the excessive cold at the pole may ren∣der
the sea colder than ice, without freezing its
surface. Besides, at 80 or 82 degrees, the sea,
though mixed with snow and fresh water, is ne∣ver
frozen, excepting near the coasts. From
the united testimony of several navigators, it is
apparent, that there is a passage from Europe to
China by the north sea: The reason why it
has so often been in vain attempted is, that fear
prevented the undertakers from keeping at a
sufficient distance from the land, and from ap∣proaching
the pole, which they probably ima∣gined
to be an immense rock.</P>
<P>William Barents, however, who, like many
others, had run aground in his voyage, never
doubted of the existence of such a passage, or
that, if he had kept farther from land, he would
have found an open sea without ice. The Rus∣sian
navigators sent by the Czar to reconnoitre
the north sea, relate, that Nova Zembla is not
an island, but a part of Tartary, and that, to the
north of it, there is a free and open sea. A
Dutch voyager affirms, that whales are occasio∣nally
thrown upon the coasts of Corea and of
<PB N="146" REF="177"/>
Japan, with European harpoons sticking in their
backs. Another Hollander alledges, that he had
penetrated to the pole itself, and assures us, that
it was as warm as at Amsterdam in summer.
One Goulden, an Englishman, who had made
above thirty voyages to Greenland, related to
Charles II. that two Dutchmen, who sailed along
with him, having been unsuccessful in fishing
off the coast of the Isle of Edges, resolved to
proceed northward; that, upon their return,
fifteen days after, they told him, that they had
been at the 89th degree of latitude, where they
found no ice, but an open, deep sea, like that in
the Bay of Biscay; and that they showed him
the two ships journals, in support of what they
advanced. In fine, it is related in the Philoso∣phical
Transactions, that two navigators, who
engaged in the discovery of this passage, pene∣trated
300 leagues to the east of Nova Zembla;
but that the East India Company, who thought
they had an interest in preventing the discovery,
allowed them not to return<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Collect. of Voyages to the North, p. 200.</NOTE>. But the Dutch
East India Company, who believed themselves
interested in the discovery, having made unsuc∣cesful
attempts on the European side, tried to
find it by the way of Japan; and they would
probably have succeeded, if the Emperor of Ja∣pan
had not prohibited all strangers from navi∣gating
on the coasts of the lands of Jesso. This
passage, therefore, cannot be found but by
<PB N="147" REF="178"/>
steering directly to the pole beyond Spitzbergen,
or rather by keeping the open sea between Nova
Zembla and Spitzbergen, under the 79th degree
of latitude. For the reasons already given, there
is no occasion to dread ice, even under the Pole
itself; for there is no example of a large sea
freezing at a great distance from land. The on∣ly
sea that freezes totally is the Black Sea, which
is narrow, contains little salt, and receives from
the northern countries a number of rivers, and
large boards of ice. If we may credit historians,
this sea, in the time of the Emperor Coprony∣mus,
froze to the depth of 30 cubits. This may
be an exaggeration: But that it freezes every
winter is certain, while open seas, 1000 leagues
nearer the Pole, never do. This can only be
explained from the superior saltness, and the
comparatively small quantity of ice-boards which
those seas receive.</P>
<P>These boards of ice, which have been regard∣ed
as invincible obstacles to navigation near the
Poles, only prove the existence of large rivers in
the neighbourhood of the places where they ap∣pear;
they also demonstrate the existence of vast
continents, from which these rivers derive their
sources; and, therefore, we ought not to be dis∣couraged
by their appearance: Besides, very
little reflection will convince us, that these boards
of ice must be confined to particular places;
that it is impossible they should occupy the
whole circle in which the southern continent is
<PB N="148" REF="179"/>
supposed to be contained; and, therefore, if a
different route were taken, we have reason to
hope for success. From the description of New
Holland, given by Dampier, and others, it is
probable, that this part of Terra Australis, which
is, perhaps, a part of the southern continent, is a
country less antient than what remains to be dis∣covered.
New Holland lies low; it has neither
mountains nor rivers; it is thinly inhabited, and
the natives have no industry. All these circum∣stances
induce us to think, that the savages of
New Holland are similar to those of the Ama∣zons,
and of Paraguay in America. In Peru and
Mexico, which are the most elevated, and, of
course, the most antient countries of America,
the manners of the inhabitants were polished;
and they were divided into distinct nations, go∣verned
by sovereigns and by laws. Savages, on
the contrary, are always found in low and new
countries. Hence we may presume, that, in the
elevated and interior parts of the southern con∣tinent,
from which issue those large rivers that
carry down boards of ice to the sea, there are
men united by the bonds of society.</P>
<P>The interior parts of Africa are nearly as little
known to us as they were to the antients. They
had circumnavigated this immense peninsula;
but they have neither left us charts, nor descrip∣tions
of its coasts. Pliny tells us, that this voyage
was performed in the days of Alexander the
Great; that the wrecks of some Spanish ships
<PB N="149" REF="180"/>
were found in the Arabian sea; and that Hanno,
the Carthaginian general, had sailed from Gades
to the Arabian gulf, and had written a relation
of the voyage. He farther informs us, that, in
the days of Cornelius Nepos, one Eudoxus,
who had been persecuted by King Lathurus, was
obliged to fly; that he departed from the Ara∣bic
gulf, and arrived at Gades; and that, previ∣ous
to this period, Spain carried on a trade by
sea with Aethiopia.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Plin. Hist. Nat. lib. 2.</NOTE>. But, these antient testi∣monies
notwithstanding, we are of opinion, that
they never doubled the Cape of Good Hope;
and every man considered the voyage of the
Portuguese to the East Indies as a new discove∣ry.
It will not be incurious to see the senti∣ments
entertained of this subject in the ninth
century. 'In our days, a discovery has been
made which was totally unknown to those
who lived before us. No man believed, or
could suspect, that the sea which reaches from
the Indies to China had any communication
with the sea of Syria. But we have lately
found, according to my information, in the
Mediterranean, or sea of <HI>Roum,</HI> the wreck of
an Arabian ship which had been staved to
pieces by a tempest; some of these pieces had
been carried, by the wind and the waves, into
the sea of the Cozars; from thence round to the
Mediterranean, and along that sea to the coast
of Syria. This is a demonstration that the
<PB N="150" REF="181"/>
ocean surrounds China and Cila, the extremity
of Turqueston, and the country of the Cozars,
and that, at last, it enters by the Straits, and
washes the borders of Syria. The evidence
arises from the construction of the vessel; for
there are no ships but those of Siraf whose
planks are not nailed. But the vessel above
mentioned had all her planks stitched together
in a manner peculiar to the Arabians. But
all vessels belonging to the Mediterranean, and
coast of Syria, have their timbers fastened with
nails<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Les anciennes relationes de voyages faits par terre a la Chine, p. 53.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>I shall subjoin the remarks added by the trans∣lator
of this antient relation.</P>
<P>'Abuziel remarks, as a thing perfectly new,
that a vessel had been carried from the Indian
sea, and thrown upon the coast of Syria. To
find a passage for it into the Mediterranean,
he supposes, that there is a great extent of sea
beyond China, which communicates with the
sea of the Cozars, or of Muscovia. The sea
beyond Cape Current was entirely unknown
to the Arabians, on account of the extreme
hazard of navigating it, and because the con∣tinent
was inhabited by a people so barbarous,
that it was impossible either to conquer them,
or to civilize them by commerce. The Por∣tuguese
found not, from the Cape of Good
Hope to Soffala, any Moors who had an esta∣blished
<PB N="151" REF="182"/>
settlement, like those in all the maritime
villages as far as China, which was the farthest
place known to geographers. But they could
not tell whether the Chinese sea communi∣cated
with that of Barbary by the extremity
of Africa; they only described it to the coast
of Zinga or Caffraria. We cannot, therefore,
hesitate in pronouncing, that the first discovery
of the passage of this sea, by the Cape of Good
Hope, was made by the Europeans, under the
command of Vasco de Gama, or, at least, a
few years before he doubled that Cape, if we
may credit some sea charts of an older date,
where the Cape is marked under the name of
<HI>Fronteira da Africa.</HI> Antony Galvan relates,
upon the testimony of Francisco de Sousa Ta∣vares,
that, in 1528, the Infant Don Ferdi∣nand
shewed him a similar chart from the
monastery of Acoboca, dated 120 years before,
copied, perhaps, from that said to be in the
treasury of St Marc at Venice, on which the
point of Africa is likewise delineated, accor∣ding
to the evidence of Ramusio,' &amp;c.</P>
<P>The ignorance of these ages concerning the
navigation round Africa is not, perhaps, so
singular as the silence of the editor of this an∣tient
relation with regard to the passages in He∣rodotus,
Pliny, &amp;c. which we have quoted, and
which prove that the antients had sailed round
Africa.</P>

However this matter stands, the coasts of Afri∣ca
are now well known. But all the attempts
that have been made to penetrate into the interior
parts, have not furnished us with exact accounts.
It would be a great object to go far up the coun∣try,
by means of Senegal, or some other great
river, and establish settlements. According to
every appearance, we should there find a coun∣try
as rich in precious metals as Peru or Brasil.
It is well known, that the rivers of Africa a∣bound
in gold dust; and, as the country is very
high and mountainous, and is, besides, situated
under the equator, it admits not a doubt, that it
contains, as well as America, mines of the hea∣viest
metals, and stones of the hardest and of the
most compact texture.</P>
<P>The vast extent of north and east Tartary is
but a late discovery. If the Russian charts be
just, we know the whole coast of this part of
Asia; and it appears, that, from the termination
of East Tartary to North America, is not above
400 or 500 leagues. It has even been lately re∣duced
to a much shorter space. In the Amster∣dam
Gazette of 24th January 1747, under the
article Petersburgh, it is alledged, that M. Stalle∣ravoit
had discovered, beyond Kamtschatka, one
of the North American isles, and that he had de∣monstrated
that we might pass from Russia to
America by a very short passage. The Jesuites
and other missionaries also pretended to have
known savages in Tartary, whom they had ca∣techized
in America, which supposes the passage
<PB N="153" REF="188"/>
to be indeed very short<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Charlevoix, tom. 3. p. 30.</NOTE>. Charlevoix would
have us believe, that the old and new continents
are united in the northern parts. He says, that
some late voyages of the Japanese make it pro∣bable
that the passage we have been mentioning
is only a bay, beyond which we may pass, by
land, from Asia to America. But this notion
requires confirmation; for it has always been
thought, that the continent of the North Pole is
probably separated from all other continents, as
well as that of the South Pole.</P>
<P>Astronomy and navigation have reached to so
high a pitch of perfection, that we may reason∣ably
hope soon to have an exact knowledge of
the whole surface of the globe. The antients,
who were ignorant of the mariner's compass,
were able to discover only a small part of it.
Some pretend that the Arabians invented this
instrument, and that, by means of it, they car∣ried
on trade with India as far as China<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See l'Abregé de l'hist. des Sarazins de Bergeron, p. 119.</NOTE>. But
this notion has always appeared to me to be de∣stitute
of foundation; for there is not in the
Arabian, Turkish, or Persian languages, a word
that signifies a mariner's compass: They use the
Italian word <HI>bossola.</HI> Even at this moment, they
can neither make compasses nor give polarity
to the needle. They purchase them from the
Europeans. Father Martini alledges, that the Chi∣nese
have been acquainted with the compass these
<PB N="154" REF="189"/>
3000 years<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See hist. Sinicae, p. 106.</NOTE>. If these facts be true, how should
it happen that they have made so little use of it?
Why, in their voyages to Cochinchina did they
take a longer course than was necessary? Why
did they always limit themselves to the same ex∣peditions,
the longest of which was to Java and
Sumatra? And why did they not discover, be∣fore
the Europeans, a vast variety of islands and
of fertile countries in their own neighbourhood,
if they possessed the art of navigating in the o∣pen
seas? It was but a few years after the dis∣covery
of this wonderful quality of the load∣stone,
that the Portuguese doubled the Cape of
Good Hope, and traversed the African and In∣dian
oceans, and that Christopher Columbus
sailed to America.</P>
<P>It was not difficult to conjecture, that immense
regions existed in the western part of the globe;
for, on computing what was known of it, name∣ly,
the distance from Spain to China, and attend∣ing
to the revolution of the earth, or of the hea∣vens,
it was easy to perceive, that a greater ex∣tent
lay to the west than what had been already
discovered on the east. That the antients found
not the new world, was not owing to a deficien∣cy
in astronomical science, but solely to their
ignorance of the compass. The passages of Plato
and of Aristotle, which mention countries far
beyond the Pillars of Hercules, seem to indicate
that some mariners had been driven by a tempest
<PB N="155" REF="190"/>
on the coast of America, from which they had
returned with infinite labour. But, supposing
the antients had been thoroughly convinced that
such a continent existed, being ignorant of the
compass, they could not possibly derive any ad∣vantage
from it.</P>
<P>I acknowledge, that it is not absolutely im∣possible
for resolute men, with no other guide
than the stars, to sail in open seas. The antients
were in possession of the Astrolabe. They might
take their departure from France or Spain, and
sail to the west by always keeping the polar star
on the right hand; and, by frequent soundings,
they might keep nearly in the same latitude. It
was unquestionably by keeping the pole-star on
their left, that the Carthaginians mentioned by
Aristotle were enabled to return from these distant
regions. But it will still be allowed, that such
a voyage must have been regarded as a rash and
hazardous enterprise. We ought not, therefore,
to be surprised, that the antients never conceived
such a project.</P>
<P>Before the expedition of Columbus, the
Azores, the Canaries, and Madeira, had been
discovered. It had been remarked, that, when
the west winds continued long to blow, the sea
threw upon the coasts of these islands pieces of
strange wood, canes of an unknown species, and
even dead bodies, which, by several marks, were
known to be neither Europeans nor Africans<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Charlevoix, tom. 1. p. 66.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="191"/>
Columbus himself remarked, that, on the west
coasts, certain winds blew for some days, which
he was persuaded proceeded from land. But,
though he had all these advantages over the an∣tients,
and likewise the compass, the difficulties
to be encountered were so great, that nothing
less than success could have justified the en∣terprise.
Suppose, for a moment, that the
continent of America had been 1000 or 1500
leagues more distant, a circumstance which Co∣lumbus
could neither foresee nor prevent, he
never would have arrived, and perhaps this vast
country might still have remained undiscovered.
This conjecture receives additional force, when
it is considered, that Columbus, though the ablest
navigator of his age, was seized with terror and
astonishment in his second voyage to the New
World: As, in his first voyage, he found no∣thing
but islands, he directed his course more to
the south in quest of a continent; but found
himself stopped by currents, the great extent of
which, and their uniform opposition to his course,
obliged him to direct his search more to the west.
He imagined, that it was not currents which
prevented him from advancing to the south, but
that the sea was rising to the heavens, and that
both perhaps touched each other in the southern
parts: Thus, in great undertakings, the most
trifling difficulty may sometimes turn a man's
brain, and extinguish his courage.</P>

<PB REF="192"/>
<HEAD>PROOFS
OF THE
THEORY OF THE EARTH.</HEAD>
<HEAD>ARTICLE VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the Formation of Strata, or Beds in the Earth.</HEAD>
<P>WE have demonstrated, in the first article,
that the earth, in consequence of the
mutual attraction between the particles of mat∣ter,
and of the centrifugal force which results
from its diurnal revolution, behoved to assume
the figure of a spheroid, the two diameters of
which differ about a 230th part; and that no∣thing
but the changes made on its surface by the
motions of the air and of the waters, could aug∣ment
this difference, in the manner alledged by
those who measured a degree under the equator,
and another within the polar circle. This fi∣gure
of the earth, which agrees so well with the
laws of hydrostatics and with our theory, indi∣cates
<PB N="158" REF="193"/>
that, at the time it assumed its figure, it
was in a state of fluidity. We have also pro∣ved,
that the projectile motion, and the motion
of rotation, were impressed at the same time, and
by the same impulse. It will the more readily
be admitted, that the earth was originally in a
state of liquefaction, when it is considered, that
the greatest part of the materials of which this
globe is composed, are either vitrifications, or vi∣trifiable
by fire. The impossibility of rendering
the earth fluid by the operation of waters con∣firms
this hypothesis; because there is infinitely
more earth than water; and the water is not
able to dissolve sand, rocks, and hard minerals.</P>
<P>It is, therefore, evident, that the earth assum∣ed
its figure when in a melted state: And, to
pursue our theory, it is natural to think, that
the earth, when it issued from the sun, had no
other form but that of a torrent of melted and
inflamed matter; that this torrent, by the mu∣tual
attraction of its parts, took on a globular
figure, which its diurnal motion changed into a
spheroid; that, when the earth cooled, the va∣pours,
which are expanded like the tail of a co∣met,
gradually condensed, fell down in the form
of water upon the surface, depositing, at the
same time, a slimy substance, mixed with sul∣phur
and salts, part of which was carried, by
the motion of the waters, into the perpendicu∣lar
fissures of the strata, and produced metals;
and the rest remained on the surface, and gave
<PB N="159" REF="194"/>
rise to the vegetable mould, which abounds, in
different places, with more or less of animal and
vegetable particles, the organization of which is
not obvious to the senses.</P>
<P>Thus the interior parts of the globe were ori∣ginally
composed of vitrified matter; and, I
believe, they continue so at present. Above this
vitrified matter, were placed those bodies which
the fire had reduced into the smallest particles,
as sands, which are only portions of glass; and,
above these, pumice stones, and the scoriae of
melted matter, which produced the different
clays. The whole was covered with water to
to the depth of 5 or 600 feet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This opinion, that the earth was entirely covered with wa∣ter, corresponds with the sentiments of several antient philoso∣phers, and likewise with those of many of the fathers of the church. In mundi primordio, aqua in omnem terram stagna∣bat, says St John of Damascus, lib. 2. cap. 9. Terra erat in∣visibilis, quia exundabat aqua et operiebat terram; St Ambrose, lib. 1. cap. 8. Submersa tellus cum esset, faciem ejus inundante aqua, non erat adspectabilis; St Basile, Hom. 2. See likewise St Augustine, lib. 1. cap. 12.</NOTE>, which origina∣ted
from the condensation of the vapours, when
the earth began to cool. This water deposited
a stratum of mud, mixed with all those matters
which are capable of being sublimed or exhaled
by fire; and the air was formed of the most
subtile vapours, which, from their levity, rose
above the water.</P>
<P>Such was the condition of the earth, when
the tides, the winds, and the heat of the sun,
began to introduce changes on its surface. The
<PB N="160" REF="195"/>
diurnal motion of the earth, and that of the
tides, elevated the waters in the equatorial re∣gions,
and necessarily transported thither great
quantities of slime, clay, and sand, and by thus
elevating these parts of the earth, they perhaps
sank those under the poles about two leagues,
as was formerly remarked: For the waters
would easily reduce into powder pumice-stones,
and other spungy parts of the vitrified matter
upon the surface, and, by this means, excavate
some places, and elevate others, which, in time,
would produce islands and continents, and all
those inequalities on the surface, which are more
considerable towards the equator than the poles.
The highest mountains lie between the Tropics
and the middle of the Temperate Zones, and the
lowest from the polar circles towards the poles.
Between the Tropics are the Cordeliers, most of
the mountains of Mexico and the Brasils, the
great and lesser Atlas, the mountains of the
Moon, &amp;c. Besides, both the land and the sea
have most inequalities between the tropics, as is
evident from the incredible number of islands
peculiar to those regions.</P>
<P>However independent this hypothesis, con∣cerning
the original state of the globe, may be
of my general theory, I have chosen to refer to
it in this article, to show the connection and
possibility of the system endeavoured to be esta∣blished
in the first article. It may only be re∣marked,
that my theory is not opposed by the
<PB N="161" REF="196"/>
facts; that I take the earth nearly as it stands
at present; and that I lay hold of none of those
suppositions which are often used in reasoning
concerning the former condition of this globe.
But, as I here offer a new idea upon this sub∣ject
of the sediment deposited by the waters,
which, in my opinion, gave rise to the upper
stratum of the earth, it will not be improper to
exhibit the reasons upon which it is founded.</P>
<P>The vapours exhaled from the earth produce
rain, dews, thunder, lightening, and other mete∣ors.
These vapours, therefore, are mixed with
particles of water, air, sulphur, earth, &amp;c.; and
it is the solid earthy particles which constitute
the slime or mud under consideration. The
purest rain-water deposites a quantity of this
mud; and, when a quantity of dew is collected,
and allowed to corrupt, it produces a greater
proportional quantity of mud, which is fat,
unctuous, and of a reddish colour.</P>
<P>The upper stratum of the earth is composed
of this mud, mixed with particles of animal and
vegetable substances, or rather with particles of
stone and sand. It may be remarked, that most
arable land is reddish, and more or less blended
with heterogeneous matters. The particles of
stone or of sand found in it are of two kinds;
the one is gross and heavy, the other fine, and
sometimes impalpable. The gross is detached
from the inferior stratum by labouring the
ground; or rather, the upper stratum, by pene∣trating
<PB N="162" REF="197"/>
the inferior, which is composed of sand
or gravel, forms what is called <HI>fat,</HI> or <HI>fertile
sand.</HI> The finer species proceeds from the air,
falls down with the dew or rain, and intimately
incorporates with the vegetable mould, or upper
stratum. This last is nothing more than the
dust, transported by the air, and again deposited
during a moist atmosphere. When the quantity
of this mud is great, in proportion to the par∣ticles
of stone or sand, the soil is red and fer∣tile;
if it be considerably mixed with animal
and vegetable substances, it is blackish; but, if
the quantity of mud, and of vegetable and ani∣mal
substances be small, the soil is white and
barren; and, even when the particles of sand,
stone, or chalk, which compose these barren
soils, are mixed with a considerable quantity of
animal and vegetable substances, they become
black and light, but have very little fertility.
According, therefore, to the different proportions
of these three ingredients, soils are more or less
fertile, and differently coloured.</P>
<P>In order to acquire distinct ideas concerning
the strata of the earth, we shall take for an ex∣ample
the pits at Marly-la-Ville, which are ex∣ceedingly
deep. It is situated in a high, but
flat and fertile country, and its strata lie hori∣zontally.
I procured specimens of all these strata
in their order from M. Dalibard, an eminent
botanist, and a man of science; and, after ha∣ving
proved the matters they respectively consist
<PB N="163" REF="198"/>
of with aqua fortis, I arranged them in the fol∣lowing

<P>I mentioned above, that I had examined all
these substances with aqua fortis, because no o∣ther
test can enable us to make real distinctions
between earthy bodies of the same or of different
appearances. Those which effervesce and sud∣denly
dissolve on the application of the aqua
fortis, are generally calcinable. Those, on the
other hand, upon which that acid makes no im∣pression,
are vitrifiable.</P>
<P>From the above enumeration of strata it is e∣vident,
that that the land at Marly-la-ville was for∣merly
covered with the sea, to the depth of 75
feet, since shells are found 75 feet below the
surface. Those shells have been collected and
deposited by the water, along with the sand
which contains them; and the whole superior
strata, excepting the uppermost, have been trans∣ported
thither by the motion of the waters, and
<PB N="166" REF="201"/>
deposited in the form of sediment, as is appa∣rent
from their horizontal position, from the
mixture of sand, shells, and marle, which last is
composed of decayed shells; and even the up∣per
stratum has been almost wholly formed of
slime or mud, with a small mixture of marle.</P>
<P>I have chosen this example, because it is least
favourable to my theory; for it appears, at first
view, difficult to conceive how the mud depo∣sited
by the dew and rains should produce a
bed of vegetable soil 13 feet thick. But it
ought to be remarked, that a soil of this thick∣ness
is rarely to be found, especially in high
countries. The general run of soils are from
three to four feet, and often they exceed not
one foot. The soil is thickest in plains sur∣rounded
with hills; because the rains daily bring
fresh supplies from the higher grounds. But,
abstracting from this supposition, it is plain, that
the upper strata formed by the sea, are thick
beds of marle. It is natural to think, that the
upper stratum, above mentioned, was originally
much thicker, and that, besides the 13 feet, the
sea would leave a considerable quantity of marle.
But this marle, being exposed to the action of
the air, of rains, and of the rays of the sun,
would soon be reduced into a fine powder. The
sea would not leave this land suddenly, but
would continue for som time occasionally to
cover it, either by the motion of the tides, or
by extraordinary swells during great storms; and,
<PB N="167" REF="202"/>
of course, the upper stratum would be mixed
with mud, clay, and other slimy bodies. After
being entirely above the reach of the waves,
plants would begin to grow, and the soil would
constantly accumulate, and be tinged with a
reddish colour, by the mud deposited from dews
and rain. Culture would still farther increase
both its fertility and its thickness, and, by al∣lowing
the dews and rains to penetrate deeper,
would in the end produce this soil of 13 feet.</P>
<P>I shall not here examine, whether the reddish
colour of vegetable mould proceeds from a quan∣tity
of iron contained in the mud deposited by
rain and dews. This point, which is of some
importance, shall be discussed when we come to
treat of minerals. It is sufficient to have given
a view of the manner in which the upper stratum
has been formed: We shall now prove, by other
examples, that the formation of the interior stra∣ta
of the earth must likewise have originated
from the operation of the waters.</P>
<P>The upper stratum of the globe, says Wood∣ward,
that magazine for the formation and sup∣port
of animals and vegetables, is mostly com∣posed
of vegetable and animal matter, and is in
perpetual fluctuation. All the animals and ve∣getables
which have existed since the creation,
have successively extracted from this stratum the
materials of which their bodies are constructed;
these they again restore at their dissolution, where
they remain prepared for the successive forma∣tion
<PB N="168" REF="203"/>
of new bodies of the same species; the mat∣ter
which forms one body being naturally dis∣posed
to make another of the same kind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Woodward's Essay, p. 136.</NOTE>. In
uninhabited countries, where the woods are
never cut, nor the herbs brouzed by cattle, the
soil is constantly augmenting. The soil, in all
woods, even in those which are occasionally cut,
is from 6 to 8 feet thick, and has originated
from decayed leaves, and other parts of ve∣getables.
I have often remarked, upon an old
Roman way which runs across Burgundy, that
the stones with which it was constructed are
covered with a black mould of more than a foot
thick, and nourishes trees of a considerable size.
This soil could only be produced by the gradual
and successive destruction of vegetable bodies.
As vegetables derive more of their substance
from the air and from water, than from the earth,
when they decay, they add more to the earth
than they extracted from it. Besides, forests
collect and retain vapours and moisure; and,
of course, in old woods, the soil is greatly aug∣mented.
But, as animals restore much less to
the earth than they take from it; and, as men
consume vast quantities of wood and herbs, for
feuel and other purposes, it follows, that the ve∣getable
soil of populous countries must conti∣nually
diminish, and become, in time, like that
of Arabia Petrea, and other eastern countries,
which were first inhabited, where nothing is to
<PB N="169" REF="204"/>
be found but sand and salts; for the fixed salts
of plants and of animals remain, while all the
other parts volatilize, and are carried off by the
air.</P>
<P>Let us next examine the position and forma∣tion
of the interior strata. The earth, says
Woodward, wherever it has been dug, is com∣posed
of beds or strata, one above another, in
the same manner as if they had proceeded from
successive sediments deposited by water. The
beds that lie deepest are thicker than those im∣mediately
above them, and they grow gradual∣ly
thinner till they arive at the surface. Sea-shells,
teeth, and bones of fishes, are found in
these beds, and not only in those which are soft,
as chalk, clay, and marle, but even in beds of
hard stone, marble, &amp;c. These productions of
the sea are incorporated with the stone, and,
when separated, leave in the stone the figure of
their surface exactly delineated. 'I was abun∣dantly
assured,' says this author, 'that the cir∣cumstances
of these things in remoter coun∣tries
were much the same with those of ours
here: That the stone, and other terrestrial mat∣ter,
in France, Flanders, Holland, Spain, Italy,
Germany, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden,
was distinguished into strata, or layers, as it is
in England: That those strata were divided by
parallel fissures: That there were inclosed in
the stone, and all the other denser kinds of
terrestrial matter, great numbers of shells, and
<PB N="170" REF="205"/>
other productions of the sea; in the same man∣ner
as in that of this island. To be short, by
the same means I got sufficient intelligence that
these things were found in like manner in Bar∣bary,
in Egypt, in Guiney, and other parts of
Africa: In Arabia, Syria, Persia, Malabar,
China, and other Asiatick provinces: In Ja∣maica,
Barbadoes, Virginia, New England,
Brasil, Peru, and other parts of America.,
p. 6. 41. 42. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Woodward gives no authority for his asser∣tion,
that shells are found in the strata of Peru.
But as, in general, his facts are true, I doubt not
but his information has been good; and I am
persuaded that shells exist in the strata of Peru,
as well as every where else. I make this re∣mark
on account of a doubt which has been
entertained on this subject, and which shall af∣terwards
be considered.</P>
<P>In digging a well at Amsterdam, 232 feet
deep, the strata were arranged in the following
order: 7 feet of vegetable soil; 9 feet of turf;
9 feet of soft clay; 8 feet of sand; 4 of earth;
10 of clay; 4 of earth; 10 of sand; 2 of clay;
4 of small white sand; 5 of dry earth; 1 of soft
earth; 14 of sand; 8 of clay mixed with sand;
4 of sand mixed with shells; then 102 feet of
clay; and, <HI>lastly,</HI> 31 feet of sand<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Varenii Geograph. gen. p. 46.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is uncommon to dig so deep before we find
water: But this experiment is remarkable in
<PB N="171" REF="206"/>
many other respects. 1<HI>st,</HI> It demonstrates that
the sea communicates not with the interior parts
of the earth by means of filtration: 2<HI>d,</HI> That
shells are found 100 feet below the surface in a
country extremely low; and, consequently, that
the land of Holland has been elevated 100 feet
by the sediments of the ocean: 3<HI>d,</HI> It may be
concluded, that the bed of clay of 102 feet, and
the bed of sand, 31 feet of which only had been
dug, and whose actual thickness is unknown, lie
near to the antient and original earth, which ex∣isted
before the motion of the waters began to
change its surface. In the first article, it was
remarked, that, in order to discover the antient
earth, we must dig in the northern, rather than
in the southern regions; and in the low and
plain, rather than in the elevated countries.
These circumstances nearly concurred in the pre∣sent
case. We only wish that the pit had been
dug deeper, and that the author had informed
us, whether shells, or other sea-bodies, were in∣termixed
with the last strata of clay and of sand.
This experiment confirms what was above ad∣vanced,
that the strata are always thicker in pro∣portion
to their depth.</P>
<P>The earth consists of parallel and horizontal
strata, not in the plains only, but, in general, the
hills and mountains have the same structure.
The strata of the mountains are even more con∣spicuous
than those of the plains; for the plains
are commonly covered with great quantities of
<PB N="172" REF="207"/>
sand and earth brought from the higher grounds
by the waters; and, therefore, to find the antient
strata, we must dig deeper in the plains than in
the mountains.</P>
<P>I have often remarked, that, when the top of
a mountain is level, its strata are likewise level;
but, when the top is not horizontal, the strata
follow the direction of its declivity. It has fre∣quently
been alledged, that the beds of quarries
incline to the east. But in all the chains of
rocks which I have examined, I found, that
these beds always follow the declivity of the
hill, whether its direction be east, west, south, or
north. In raising stones from the quarry, they
are always separated according to their natural
position; and, if cut in a contrary direction, it is
impossible to raise them of any considerable size.
In all good masonry, the workmen place the
stones in the direction in which they lay in the
quarry. If laid in an opposite position, they will
spilt, and not be able to resist the weight of the
incumbent building. Hence we may conclude,
that stones have been originally formed in hori∣zontal
beds; that these beds have been successive∣ly
accumulated above each other, and have been
composed of materials, the resistance of which is
stronger in that than in any other direction.</P>
<P>Every stratum, of whatever kind, whether it
be horizontal or inclined, is of an equal thick∣ness
through its whole extent. In the quarries
round Paris, the stratum of good stone is but a∣bout
<PB N="173" REF="208"/>
18 or 20 inches thick throughout. In the
quarries of Burgundy, the stone is much thicker.
The same inequalities take place in marbles.
The white and black marbles are thicker than
those that are coloured; and there is a hard stone
with which the people of Burgundy cover their
houses, that exceeds not an inch in thickness.
Thus, different strata differ much with regard to
thickness; but each stratum uniformly preserves
the same thickness through its whole extent.
This difference is so great, that strata are to be
found, from less than a line, to 1, 10, 20, 30,
and 100 feet thick. Both antient and modern
quarries, which are dug horizontally, the shafts
of mines, and the working of lead, both longi∣tudinally
and transversely, prove that strata ex∣tend
a great way on all sides. 'It is well known,'
as the historian of the academy observes, 'that all
stones have originally been a soft paste, and
that, as stones are almost every where to be
met with, the surface of the earth, in all these
places, at least to a certain depth, must have
consisted of mud and slime. The shells found
in most quarries demonstrate, that this mud
was an earth diluted by the water of the sea;
and, consequently, that the sea once covered
all these places; but the sea could not cover
them, without, at the same time, covering all
places that were lower, or on the same level.
Now, it is impossible that the sea could cover
all those places where there are quarries, with∣out
<PB N="174" REF="209"/>
covering the whole surface of the globe.
If the mountains were then formed, the sea
must also have covered them; for they are full
of rocks and quarries, and shells are often
found in them.'</P>
<P>'The sea, then,' continues he, 'covered the
whole earth; and hence all the beds of stone
in the plains are horizontal and parallel: The
fishes, therefore, were the most antient inha∣bitants
of the globe; for neither land-animals
nor birds could exist. But how has the sea
retired into those vast basons which it now oc∣cupies?
The most natural supposition is, that
the earth, at least to a certain depth, was not
all equally solid, but interspersed with vast
vaults or caverns, the arches of which would
remain for a time, and at last suddenly fall in.
The waters would then rush into these hol∣lows,
fill them up, and leave a part of the sur∣face
dry, which would become a convenient
habitation for land-animals and birds. The
shells found in quarries strongly confirm this
idea; for nothing but the bony parts of fishes
could be preserved so long in the earth. Be∣sides,
shells commonly lie in vast masses in cer∣tain
parts of the sea, where they remain im∣moveable,
and form a species of rocks or banks;
they could not, therefore, follow the sea, which
suddenly abandoned them. For this last rea∣son
it is, that we find such numbers of fossil-shells,
and so few vestiges of other fishes, which
<PB N="175" REF="210"/>
is a farther proof that the waters retired with
rapidity into their present basons. When the
vaults sunk down, it is very probable that
mountains were elevated by the same cause,
and placed upon the surface with rocks and
quarries already formed. But the beds of these
quarries could not preserve their original ho∣rizontal
position, unless they were raised ex∣actly
perpendicular to the surface, which would
rarely happen. Thus, as we formerly remark∣ed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mem. de l'Acad. ann. 1705, p. 30.</NOTE>,
the beds of stone in mountains are all
inclined to the horizon, though they be paral∣lel
to each other; for they changed not their
position with regard to one another, but with
regard only to the surface of the earth<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. ann. 1716, p. 14.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>These parallel beds of earth or of stone, which
have been formed by sediments of the ocean,
often extend to considerable distances; we even
find, in hills separated by vallies, beds of the
same materials upon equal levels. This obser∣vation
has a perfect correspondence with the
equal altitudes of opposite hills. The truth of
this fact may be easily established; for, in all
hills separated by narrow vallies, where stone
or marble is found on one hill, we uniformly
find these very substances, at the same level, on
the opposite hill. I have traced a quarry of
marble 12 leagues in length; its breadth is also
considerable, though I have not been able exact∣ly
to ascertain it. I have often observed, that
<PB N="176" REF="211"/>
this bed of marble has every where the same
thickness; and that, in hills separated by a val∣ley
of 100 feet deep, the same bed always ap∣peared
at the same altitude. I am firmly per∣suaded,
that this observation holds with regard
to all quarries of stone or of marble that contain
shells; but it applies not to beds of free-stone.
We shall afterwards explain why free-stone is
not dispersed, like other matters, in horizontal
beds, but in blocks, irregular both in form and
position.</P>
<P>It has likewise been remarked, that, on the
opposite sides of straits of the sea, the strata are
the same. This observation is important, and
may lead to the discovery of those necks of land,
or islands, that have been separated from the
Continent. It proves, for example, that Eng∣land
has been separated from France, Spain from
Africa, and Sicily from Italy: And it is to be
regretted, that the same observation has not been
made upon all straits. I have no doubt but it
will hold universally. We know not, whether,
in the straits of Magellan, the longest we are
acquainted with, the same strata are to be found
at the same altitude; but we perceive, from very
exact charts, that the opposite coasts, which are
high, have corresponding angles like those ob∣servable
in our inland mountains; and this fur∣ther
proves Terra del Fuego to have been for∣merly
a part of the Continent of America. The
same remark has been made with regard to the
<PB N="177" REF="212"/>
strait of Forbisher; and the island of Friesland
appears to have been separated from the conti∣nent
of Greenland.</P>
<P>The Maldiva islands are separated from each
other by small branches of the sea; and on each
side of the opposite islands, the strata of rocks,
&amp;c. are the same. These islands, which, when
taken together, extend about 200 leagues in
length, were formerly one. They are divided
into 13 provinces, called <HI>Clusters.</HI> Every Cluster
contains a great number of small islands, most
of which will soon be under water. It is re∣markable,
that each of these 13 Clusters is sur∣rounded
with a chain of rocks of the same stone,
and that there are only three or four small and
dangerous openings through which each of them
can be approached. They are all placed in a
line, with their ends to each other, and appear
evidently to have been once a long mountain
crowned with rock<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Voyag. de Franc. Pyrard, vol. 1. p. 107.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Several authors, as Verstegan, Twine, Sommer,
but particularly Campbell, in his description of
the county of Kent, give striking proofs that
England was formerly joined to France, and that
the neck of land which divides them had been
carried off by the sea, which retired, and left a
great quantity of low marshy ground along the
southern coasts of England. As a farther proof
of this fact, Dr Wallis has attempted to show an
affinity between the antient language of the
<PB N="178" REF="213"/>
Gauls and of the Britains; and he adds several
other remarks which shall be related in the fol∣lowing
articles.</P>
<P>If travellers observed the figure of lands, the
position of mountains, and the windings of ri∣vers,
they would perceive that opposite hills are
not only composed of the same materials, at the
same altitudes, but that they are also nearly of
an equal height. In all the places where I have
travelled, I uniformly remarked this equality in
the height of opposite hills, especially when they
are separated by valleys not above a fourth or a
third of a league wide. In valleys of greater
width, it is difficult to judge of the height or e∣quality
of hills; for, on looking over a level
and extensive plain, it appears to rise; and di∣stant
hills appear to sink. But this is not the
place to account for these phaenomena. Be∣sides,
it is not easy to determine, by the eye, the
middle of a large valley, unless there be a river
in it. But, in narrow valleys, the judgment of
the eye is more certain. That part of Burgun∣dy
comprehended between Auxerre, Dijon, An∣tun,
and Bar-sur-seine, and of which a con∣siderable
portion is called <HI>le Bailliage de la
Montagne,</HI> is one of the most elevated parts of
France. From one side of these mountains,
which are only of the second order, the water
runs to the ocean, and, from the other, to the
Mediterranean. There are points of partition,
as at Sombernon, Pouilli in Auxois, &amp;c. where
<PB N="179" REF="214"/>
the water may be turned at pleasure, either to
the ocean or to the Mediterranean. This high
country is intersected with a number of small
valleys, and most of them are watered with ri∣vulets.
Here I have a thousand times observed
the corresponding angles of the hills, and their
equality as to height; and I can with confidence
affirm, that the saliant or prominent angles are
uniformly opposed to the concave ones, and that
the heights of the two sides are nearly the same.
The farther we advance in this high country,
where are the points of partition mentioned a∣bove,
the mountains are the higher. But this
height is always the same on the opposite sides
of the valleys, and the hills rise or fall equally.
The same observation I have repeatedly made in
several other provinces of France; but they ex∣tend
not to very high mountains; for these are
more irregular as to height, and often terminate
in unequal points or peaks. In frequently tra∣versing
the Alps and Appennines, I observed,
that the angles, in effect, corresponded; but that
it is almost impossible to judge, by the eye, con∣cerning
the equality or inequality in the heights
of opposite mountains; because their tops are
lost in the clouds.</P>
<P>The different strata composing the earth are
not arranged according to their specific gravities.
Beds of heavy matter are frequently placed
above those of lighter. Solid rocks are often
supported by beds of earth, clay, or sand, which
<PB N="180" REF="215"/>
have much less specific gravity. This is the case
with most hills, and is easily perceived. But, in
high mountains, the summits are not only rocks,
but these rocks are supported by others; and
this structure runs through such an extent of
country, where one mountain rises out of ano∣ther,
that it is difficult to determine whether
they are founded on earth, or of what nature
this earth is. I have seen rocks cut perpendi∣cularly
for some hundreds of feet; but these
rocks rested upon other rocks, without my be∣ing
able to perceive where they ended. May
we not, however, be allowed to conclude from
the less to the greater? Since the rocks of small
mountains, the bases of which are visible, rest
upon earths less heavy and less solid than stone,
is it not reasonable to think, that earth is like∣wise
the basis of high mountains? Besides, all I
have here advanced tends to prove, that heavy
bodies might be accumulated, by the motion of
the waters, above light ones; and, if this really
takes place in most hills, it is probable that it has
happened in the manner pointed out by my
theory. But, should it be objected, that I had
no reason to suppose, that, prior to the forma∣tion
of mountains, the heavier matter was below
the lighter; I answer, that I affirm nothing with
regard to this article; because there are many
ways by which this effect might be produced,
whether the heavy matter was above or below,
or placed indiscriminately: For, in order to
<PB N="181" REF="216"/>
conceive how the sea could first form a moun∣tain
of clay, and then crown it with rocks, we
have only to consider, that the sediments might
be transported from different places, and that
they might consist of different materials. The
sea might transport from one place several sedi∣ments
of clay, and afterwards deposite sediments
of stony matter; either because all the clay at
the bottom, or on the coasts, was exhausted,
and then the waves would attack the rocks; or,
rather, because the first sediments were trans∣ported
from one place, and the last from a dif∣ferent
one. Besides, the latter corresponds ex∣actly
with experience; for, it is a known fact,
that beds of earth, stone, gravel, sand, &amp;c. fol∣low
no rule of arrangement, but are placed in∣differently,
and, as it were, by chance, one above
another.</P>
<P>This chance, however, ought to have some
rules, which can only be discovered by analogy
and probable conjecture. We have seen, that,
according to my theory of the formation of the
globe, that its interior parts should consist of vi∣trified
matter, similar to vitrified sand, which is
only the fragments of glass, and of which the
clays are only the scoriae, or decomposed parts.
Agreeable to this supposition, the centre of the
earth, and even near to the surface itself, should
be composed of glass or vitrified matter, and
above this should be found sand, clay, and other
scoriae. Thus the earth, in its original state,
<PB N="182" REF="217"/>
was a nucleus of glass, or of vitrified matter,
either compact like glass, or divided like sand,
(for that circumstance depends on the degree of
heat applied); above this matter was sand; and,
lastly, clay. The soil, or external covering,
was produced from the air and the mud of wa∣ter;
and it is more or less thick according to the
situation of the ground; more or less coloured,
according to the different mixtures of mud,
sand, clay, and the parts of decayed animals and
vegetables; and more or less fertile, according to
the abundance or deficiency of these parts. To
show that this account of the formation of sand
and clay is not altogether imaginary, I shall add
a few remarks.</P>
<P>I suppose the earth, in its first state, to have
been a spheroid of compact glass, covered with
a thin crust of pumice-stone, and other scoriae
of melted matter. The agitation of the air and
of the water would soon reduce this crust of
pumice into powder or sand, which, by uniting
into masses, would give rise to free-stone and
flints, the varieties of which, with regard to co∣lour
and density, depend upon the different de∣grees
of fineness of the sand that composed
them.</P>
<P>The constituent parts of sand unite by the
application of fire, become very hard, compact,
and more or less transparent according to the
purity of the sand: But, on the other hand,
when exposed to the action of the air, it exfo∣liates,
<PB N="183" REF="218"/>
falls down in the form of earth, and may
thus produce clays of different kinds. This dust,
which is sometimes yellow, sometimes brilliant,
and is used to dry writings, is nothing else than
a fine sand, somewhat corrupted, and nearly re∣duced
to an elementary state. In time, its par∣ticles
become so attenuated and divided, that
they lose the power of reflecting light, and ac∣quire
all the properties of clay. On examining
a piece of clay, many of these shining or talky
particles appear, they not having yet entirely
lost their original form. Sand, therefore, in
process of time, may produce clay; and this clay,
by a farther division, acquires the qualities of a
mud or slime, a vitrifiable matter of the same
nature with clay.</P>
<P>This theory is confirmed by daily experience.
In washing sand, the water becomes impreg∣nated
with a black, soft, fatty earth, which is
a genuine clay. The mud swept from streets
paved with free-stone is black and very fat,
and, when dried, it discovers itself to be an
earth of the same nature with clay. Clay, taken
from places where there is neither flint nor
free-stone, and diluted with water, always pre∣cipitates
a great quantity of vitrifiable sand.</P>
<P>But, what clearly demonstrates the existence
of sand, and even of flint and galss in clay, is,
that the reunion of its parts, by the action of
fire, restores it to its original form. Clay, when
heated to the degree of calcination, is covered with
<PB N="184" REF="219"/>
a hard coat of enamel; if its internal parts are
not vitrified, they become so extremely hard, as
to resist the file; they strike fire with the ham∣mer,
and acquire all the properties of flint: A
great degree of heat melts and converts them
into real glass.</P>
<P>Clay and sand, therefore, are substances per∣fectly
analogous, and of the same kind. If clay
can be condensed to flint, and even to glass, why
may not sand, by resolution, become clay?
Glass appears to be the true elementary earth,
and all mixed bodies are only glass in disguise.
Metals, minerals, salts, &amp;c. are only a vitrifiable
earth: Common stone, and other analogous bo∣dies,
testaceous and crustaceous shells, &amp;c. are
the only substances which cannot be vitrified,
and which seem to form a distinct class. The
former, by the action of fire, may be converted
into a homogeneous, hard, and transparent sub∣stance,
without any diminution of its weight,
and upon which no farther change can be made.
The latter, on the contrary, which consist of
more active and volatile principles, calcine in
the fire, lose more than a third of their weight,
and resume the form of simple earth, without
any other change than the dissolution of their
constituent parts. If these bodies be excepted,
which are few in number, and of which the
combinations produce few varieties in nature,
all other substances, and particularly clay, may
be converted into glass, and, consequently, are
<PB N="185" REF="220"/>
only glass in a decomposed state. If the fire
quickly vitrifies these substances, glass itself,
whether simple, or in the form of sand or flint,
naturally, but by a slow and insensible progress,
resolves into clay.</P>
<P>In countries where flint is the predominant
stone, the fields are commonly strewed with
fragments of it: And, if the place be unculti∣vated,
and if the flints have remained long ex∣posed
to the air, without being moved, their up∣per
surface is always white; but the surface next
the ground preserves its natural colour, which is
very brown. When these flints are broken, the
whiteness appears to be not superficial only, but
penetrates more or less into their internal parts,
and forms a belt, which in some is not very
deep, but, in others, occupies nearly the whole
stone. This white part is somewhat granulated,
perfectly opaque, as tender as free-stone, and
adheres to the tongue like the boles. But the
other portion of the flint is smooth and polished,
has neither thread nor grain, and preserves its o∣riginal
colour, its transparancy, and its hardness.
When this half decomposed flint is put into a
furnace, the white part becomes red like a brick,
and the brown part becomes exceedingly white.
Why shall we conclude, with a famous natura∣list,
that flints of this kind are imperfect, and
that they are not old enough to have acquired
their perfect state? For why should they be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
imperfect? And why should they be uniformly
<PB N="186" REF="221"/>
imperfect on the side only that is exposed to the
air? It is, on the contrary, much more probable,
that they are changed from their original state,
and partly decomposed, and that they are gra∣dually
resolving into clay or bole. If this rea∣soning
should appear to be unsatisfactory, ex∣pose
to the air the hardest and blackest flint, in
less than a year the colour of its surface will be
changed; and, if the experiment be farther pro∣secuted,
the flint will be found gradually to lose
its hardness, its transparency, and its other spe∣cific
characters, and make daily approaches to
the nature of clay.</P>
<P>Sand undergoes the same changes as flint.
Every grain of sand may, perhaps, be considered
as a small flint, and every piece of flint as a col∣lection
of fine sand cemented together. The
first example of the decomposition of sand is
exhibited in that shining, but opaque powder,
called <HI>mica,</HI> with which clay and slate are al∣ways
impregnated. The quartz, or perfectly
transparent flints, in decomposing, produce fat
and soft talks, such as those of Venice and Rus∣sia,
which are as ductile and vitrifiable as clay;
and, it appears, that talk is the mean between
glass, or transparent flint, and clay; but that the
gross and impure flints, in decomposing, are
converted into clay without any intermediate
state.</P>
<P>Our made glass undergoes the same change;
when long exposed to the air, it decomposes,
and, as it were, corrupts. At first, it takes on a
<PB N="187" REF="222"/>
number of colours, then it exfoliates, and, in
handling it, we perceive that many shining par∣ticles
fall off. But, when its decomposition is
farther advanced, it bruises between the fingers,
and is reduced to a very white, talky, and impal∣pable
powder. Art also imitates nature in the
decomposition of glass and flint. 'Est etiam

<P>These matters shall be more fully considered
when we come to treat of metals. We shall
here only add, that the different strata of the
globe, consist either of materials which may
be considered as actual vitrifications, or analo∣gous
to glass, and possessing its most essential
qualities; and that it is also evident, from the
decomposition of glass and of flint, which daily
takes place, there results a genuine clay; we
may therefore conclude, with a high degree of
probability, that sand and clays have originally
been the scoriae of burnt matter, especially when
we join, to the above circumstances, the proofs
<HI>a priori</HI> which have been employed to show that
the earth was formerly in a state of liquefac∣tion
occasioned by the operation of fire.</P>

<HEAD>PROOFS
OF THE
THEORY OF THE EARTH.</HEAD>
<HEAD>ARTICLE VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of Shells, and other productions of the Sea, found
in the Interior Parts of the Earth.</HEAD>
<P>I Have often examined quarries, the stones of
which were full of shells; I have seen whole
hills composed of shells, and chains of rocks in∣termixed
with shells through their whole extent.
The quantity of shells, and other productions
of the sea, is, in many places, so prodigious, that
one could with difficulty believe that any more
of them existed in their natural element. It is
from this enormous quantity that no doubt re∣mains
of the earth's having continued for a very
long time under the waters of the sea. The
number of sea-shells found in a fossil or petri∣fied
state is so amazing, that, were it not for
<PB N="189" REF="224"/>
this circumstance, we never should have had a
proper idea of the surprising quantities of those
animals to which the ocean gives birth. We
must not, therefore, imagine, like those who
talk and reason concerning things they never
saw, that shells are only to be found scattered
here and there by chance, or in small heaps, like
those of oisters thrown from our doors. They
appear, on the contrary, in masses like moun∣tains,
in banks of 100 or 200 leagues in length;
they may often be traced through whole pro∣vinces,
and in masses of 50 or 60 feet thick.
It is only after having learned these facts that a
man is entitled to reason on this subject.</P>
<P>The shells of Turenne may serve as a striking
example. Let us attend to the description given
of them by the historian of the Academy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Année 1720, p. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>'Though figured stones, and even fossil shells
found in the bowels of the earth, were remark∣ed
in all ages and nations, they were generally
considered, even by philosophers themselves, as
lusus naturae, their production was ascribed to
chance, or some unaccountable and fortuitous
train of circumstances; and, of course, this
wonderful phaenomenon added nothing to the
stock of knowledge. An ignorant potter in
Paris, who knew neither Greek nor Latin, to∣wards
the end of the 16th century, was the first
man<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The correspondence of Palissy's ideas with those of the antients, is worth remarking. 'Conchulas, arenas, buccinas, calculos varie infectos, frequenti solo, quibusdam etiam in mon∣tibus reperiri, certum signum maris alluvione eos coopertos locos volunt Herodotus. Plato, Strabo, Seneca, Tertullianus, Plutarchus, Ovidius, et alii;' Vide Dausqui, Terra et aqua, p. 7.</NOTE> who ventured, in opposition to all the
<PB N="190" REF="225"/>
learned, to affirm, that fossil shells were real
shells originally deposited, by the sea, in those
places where they were found; that real ani∣mals,
and particularly fishes, bestowed on fi∣gured
stones their various forms, &amp;c.; and he
boldly defied the whole school of Aristotle to
invalidate his proofs. His name was Bernard
Palissy; and he was perhaps the most conspi∣cuous
example of a philosophical genius, un∣improved
by art or learning. His system,
however, has lain dormant for near a century,
and even his name has almost been forgot.
At last, several philosophers revived Palissy's
ideas; and science has derived great advantage
from all the fossil shells and figured stones
that have appeared in the earth: They are
now, perhaps, become too common, and the
consequences drawn from them too incon∣testible.'</P>
<P>'But Reaumur's late observations on the sub∣subject
are astonishing. He discovered a mass
below ground of 130,680,000 cubic fathoms
of shells, either whole or in fragments, with∣out
the least mixture of stone, earth, sand, or
other foreign matter. Before this remarkable
instance, fossil shells never appeared in such
enormous quantities, nor without being mixed
<PB N="191" REF="226"/>
with other bodies. This prodigious mass lies in
Turenne, more than 36 leagues from the sea.
It is of great service to the peasants of that
province; they use the shells for marle in ferti∣lizing
their lands, which would otherwise be
perfectly barren.'</P>
<P>'What the peasants dig out of the earth, to
the depth of eight or nine feet, consists only of
fragments of shells; but these fragments are
easily recognised to be those of real shells; for
they still retain their original channels or
furrows, and have only lost their lustre and
varnish, as most shells do, after having re∣mained
long under ground. The smallest
fragments are only dust; but we know them
to be the dust of shells, because they consist of
the very same matter with the larger frag∣ments,
and the entire shells, which are some∣times
found. The species both of the large
fragments and of the entire shells, are easily
distinguishable. Some of these species belong
to the coast of Poitou, and others of them to
foreign shores. This mass likewise furnishes
corals, and other productions of the sea. <HI>Falun</HI>
is the name by which this matter is distinguish∣ed
in that province; and it is found, wherever
the ground is dug, through an extent of about
nine leagues square. The peasants never dig
deeper than about 20 feet; because, says Reau∣mar,
they imagine that the expence of labour
would exceed the value of the commodity.
<PB N="192" REF="227"/>
They might, however, dig deeper. But our
calculation of 130,680,000 cubic fathoms pro∣ceeds
upon the supposition of only 18 feet deep,
and 2200 fathoms to the league. Every article,
therefore, is undervalued, and this mass of shells
must greatly exceed the above calculation; if
the quantity be only doubled, this wonderful
phaenomenon will be greatly augmented.'</P>
<P>'In physical facts, there are little circumstan∣ces
often overlooked by the bulk of mankind,
which are, notwithstanding, of great conse∣quence
in illustrating the subject. M. de Reau∣mur
has remarked, that all the fragments
of shells lie horizontally in the great mass;
from which he concludes, that the fragments
were not deposited at the same time with the
entire shells which originally formed this mass;
because, says he, the superior shells would, by
their weight, have broken the inferior ones,
and the fragments, in that case, would neces∣sarily
have been disposed in a thousand differ∣ent
directions. The whole, therefore, whe∣ther
entire or broken, must have been gradual∣ly
transported thither by the sea, and, of course,
their position must have been horizontal; and,
though time alone was sufficient to break them
down, and even to calcine them, it could not
vary their original position. Their transporta∣tion
must have been gradual; for, it is impos∣sible
that such an immense number of shells
could be suddenly crouded together, and yet
<PB N="193" REF="228"/>
preserve a position uniformly horizontal; and
their being assembled in one place, demon∣strates
this place to have once been the bottom
of a gulf or bason.'</P>
<P>'Though there are many vestiges of the uni∣versal
deluge recorded in scripture; yet the
mass of shells at Turenne could not be an ef∣fect
of this deluge. Perhaps such an amazing
mass is no where to be found, even in the bot∣tom
of the sea. But, supposing the deluge to
have forced such a quantity from the ocean,
they would necessarily be carried off with vio∣lence
and precipitation; and, consequently,
could never have been deposited in the same
position. It behoved them to have been trans∣ported,
slowly floating in the waves; and, of
course, their accumulation would require a
much longer time than a year.'</P>
<P>'Upon the whole, it is plain, that, either be∣fore
or after the deluge, the earth, at least some
parts of it, must have been in a very different
situation from what it now appears; that the sea
and land must have had a different arrangement;
and, that there was formerly a great gulf in the
middle of Turenne. The changes recorded in
history, or even in antient fable, are inconside∣rable;
but they give us some idea of what
might be produced in a long series of ages. M.
de Reaumur conjectures, that Turenne was
formerly a gulf of the sea, and that the shells
were transported by a current. But this is only
<PB N="194" REF="229"/>
a mere conjecture, thrown out to supply the
place of a fact as yet imperfectly known. Be∣fore
any certain conclusion can be drawn, we
must have geographical charts of all those
places where shells are found below the surface
of the earth. To accomplish this, much time
and numberless observations are requisite.
Science, however, may in time, perhaps, be
carried thus far.'</P>
<P>An attention to the following circumstances
will lessen our surprise at this great collection of
shells: 1. Shell-fish multiply prodigiously, and
come to maturity in a very short time. The
multitude of individuals in every species, is a
demonstration of their amazing fertility. In a
single day, for example, a mass of oysters, of
several fathoms in thickness, is often raised; the
rocks to which they are attached, diminish con∣siderably
in a short time; and some banks are
entirely exhausted. The following year, how∣ever,
furnishes an equal quantity, and not the
smallest diminution appears. It is even doubted,
whether a natural bed of oysters was ever en∣tirely
exhausted. 2. The substance of shells is
analogous to that of stone; they are long pre∣served
when immersed in soft matter; and they
easily petrify when connected with matter natu∣rally
hard; these fossil shells, therefore, and other
productions of the sea found on land, being the
spoils of many ages, must necessarily have accu∣mulated
into large masses.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="230"/>
We have already remarked the prodigious
quantities of shells preserved in marble, lime∣stone,
chalk, marle, &amp;c.; that they appear in
masses like hills or mountains; and that they
often compose more than one half of the bodies
in which they are contained. Sometimes they
appear entire, and at other times in fragments,
but large enough to enable us to distinguish their
respective species. Here our knowledge of this
subject, derived from observation, stops. But I
go farther, and maintain, that shells are the me∣dium
employed by nature in the formation of
most stones; that chalk, marle, and lime-stone,
consist entirely of the dust or fragments of shells;
and, consequently, that the quantity of decom∣posed
shells is infinitely greater than that of
those which have been preserved. These posi∣tions
shall be fully established in the section up∣on
minerals; and I shall only here exhibit the
point of view in which the different strata of
the earth ought to be considered. The first bed,
in which nothing of the original structure ap∣pears,
is composed of mud deposited by dews,
rains, and snow, and of particules of animal and
vegetable substances. The inferior beds of
chalk, marle, lime-stone, and marble, are com∣posed
of the spoils of shells and other sea-bo∣dies,
mixed occasionally with entire-shells or
fragments of them. But clay and vitrifiable
sand are the materials composing the internal
parts of the globe. These substances were vitrified
<PB N="196" REF="231"/>
at the time the earth assumed its figure, which
necessarily implies, that the whole was then in
a melted state. The different species of granite,
flint, free-stone in large masses, slate, and coal,
derive their origin from sand and clay; and
are also disposed in beds. But tufa and pumice,
free-stone and flint in small or detached pieces,
crystals, metals, pyrites, most minerals, sulphurs,
&amp;c. are matters, the formation of which is re∣cent,
when compared with that of marble, cal∣cinable
stones, chalk, marle, and other sub∣stances
which are disposed in horizontal beds,
and contain shells, or other relicts of the
ocean.</P>
<P>As the terms I have employed may appear
obscure or ambiguous, it is necessary to explain
them. By <HI>clays,</HI> I mean not only the white and
yellow clays, but likewise the blue, the soft, the
hard, the laminated, &amp;c. which I consider to be
the scoriac of glass, or the decompositions of
glass. By <HI>sand,</HI> I always understand vitrifiable
sand; and I comprehend, under this denomina∣tion,
not only the sine sand which produces free∣stone,
and which I maintain to be the powder
of glass, or rather of tufa, but also that sand rub∣bed
off free-stone, and the still grosser kind re∣sembling
small gravel, proceeding from granite
and rock-stone, and which is brittle, angular, and
reddish, and generally found in the beds of those
rivers which descend precipitantly from hills or
<PB N="197" REF="232"/>
mountains composed of granite or common rock.
The river Armanson, which runs by Sernur in
Auxois, where all the stones are of common
rock, carries down great quantities of this gross,
rough, and brittle sand; it is of the same nature
with rock-stone, of which it is only small por∣tions,
as calcinable gravels are only particles of
free-stone. Besides, rock-stone and granite are
the same substances; but I have used both terms,
because they are considered by some as different
species. The same may be remarked of flints
and of free-stone in large masses: These also
are species of granite; and I call them flints in
large masses, because, like calcinable stones, they
are disposed in beds, and also to distinguish them
from flints and free-stone in small masses, as the
round flints and sand-stones which have no con∣tinuation,
or are not found in beds of any ex∣tent.
These are recent productions, and have
not the same origin as flint and free-stone in
large masses, forming regular and extensive stra∣ta.
Under <HI>slate</HI> I comprehend the blue, the
white, the gray, the reddish, and all the plated
stones. These bodies are generally found be∣low
laminated clay, and seem to be nothing else
but clay hardened into thin strata by drying;
and this is the reason of the many cracks or fis∣sures
remarkable in such substances. Coal and
jet are likewise referable to clay, and are found
under the laminated clays or slate. By <HI>tufa</HI> I
mean not only the common pumice which is
<PB N="198" REF="233"/>
full of holes, and has an organized appearance,
but all beds of stone formed by the sediments of
running waters, all the stalactites, incrustations,
and every kind of stone that dissolves by fire.
It does not admit of a doubt that all these are
new substances, and that they are constantly
growing. Tufa is only a mass of stony matter,
not distinguished by regular strata. This mat∣ter
is commonly found in small hollow cylin∣ders,
is regularly shaped, formed by rills or drip∣pings
at the foot or upon the declivities of hills,
and consisting of coats of marle or calcareous
earth. The cylindric form is the specific cha∣racter
of this kind of tufa, and it is always ei∣ther
oblique or streight, according to the direc∣tion
of the rills by which it is produced. The ex∣tent
of these spurious quarries is inconsiderable,
and generally proportioned to the height of the
mountains which furnish the materials of their
growth. The intervals between the cylinders
of the tufa, by the daily addition of fresh stony
matter, are at last filled up, and the whole as∣sumes
a compact and solid form; but it never
acquires the hardness of stone, and, for that rea∣son,
is denominated by Agricola, <HI>marga tofacea
fistulosa.</HI> In the tufa are often found impres∣sions
of the leaves of such trees and plants as
grow in the neighbourhood; land-shells, well
preserved, are likewise frequently found in the
tufa, but never any sea-shells; it is, therefore, a
recent production, and ought to be ranked with
<PB N="199" REF="234"/>
stalactites, incrustations, &amp;c. All these new
substances are a kind of spurious stones, formed
by the wasting of others, but never arrive at the
consistence of real petrifaction.</P>
<P>Crystal, precious stones, every stone that has
a regular figure, and even flints in small masses
and consisting of concentric coats, whether
found in the perpendicular fissures of rocks, or
elsewhere, are only exudations, or the concre∣ting
juices of flint in large masses; they are,
therefore, new and spurious productions, the
genuine stalactites of flint or of granite.</P>
<P>Shells are never found in common rock or
granite, nor in free-stone, although they often
appear in vitrifiable sand, from which free-stone
derives its origin. This circumstance seems to
indicate, that sand, unless when perfectly pure,
cannot unite into free-stone or granite; and that
a mixture of shells, or of other heterogeneous
bodies, totally prevents it from cementing. I
have often examined those small round stones,
found in beds of sand that are mixed with shells,
and never could discover in them a single shell.
These round stones are true concretions of free∣stone,
formed in those places where the sand is
pure, and not mixed with heterogeneous mat∣ter;
which is the reason why no larger masses
are produced.</P>
<P>We formerly remarked, that, at Amsterdam,
which is a very low country, sea-shells were
found 100 feet below the surface, and at Marly∣la-Ville,
<PB N="200" REF="235"/>
6 leagues from Paris, at the depth of
75 feet. They have also been found in mines
below beds of rock of 50, 100, 200, and even
of 1000 feet thick, as is apparent in the Alps
and Pyernnees, where shells and other sea-bodies
are found in the inferior strata of immense
rocks, that have been cut through in a perpen∣dicular
direction. But to proceed in order:
Shells are found in the mountains of Spain,
France, and England, in all the marble quarries
of Flanders, in the mountains of Gueldres, in
all the hills round Paris, in those of Burgundy
and Champagne; in a word, in all places where
the basis is not composed of free-stone or tufa;
and, in all these places, the substance of the
stones consists more of shells than of any other
matter. By shells, I mean not only the re∣mains
of shell-fish, but likewise those of crusta∣ceous
animals, the bristles of sea-hedge-hogs, and
all the productions of sea-insects, as corals, ma∣drepores,
astroites, &amp;c. Any man may be con∣vinced,
by the evidence of his own eyes, that,
in most marbles and calcinable stones, the pro∣portion
of sea-bodies is so great, as to exceed the
matter by which they are united.</P>
<P>But, farther, sea-bodies are found even on the
tops of the highest mountains of the Alps; for
example, on the top of Mount Cenis, in the
mountains of Genes, in the Apennines, and in
most of the stone and marble quarries of Italy.
They appear in the stones of which the most
<PB N="201" REF="236"/>
antient buildings in Rome are constructed, in
the mountains of Tirol, in the centre of Italy,
on the top of Mount Paterne near Boulogne, in
the hills of Pouille, in those of Calabria, in many
parts of Germany and of Hungary, and, lastly,
in all the high grounds of Europe<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Steno, Ray, Woodward, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In Asia and Africa, travellers have remarked
several places, for example, 'upon the Castra∣van
mountains, above Barute,' says Shaw<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Shaw's travels, p. 344.</NOTE>,
'where there is a curious bed of whitish stone,
but of the slate-kind, which contains, in every
fleak of it, a great number and variety of fish∣es.
These, for the most part, lie exceedingly
flat and compressed, like the fossil fern plants;
yet, at the same time, they are so well pre∣served,
that the smallest strokes and lineaments
of their fins, scales, and other superficial di∣versities,
are easily distinguished.' Between
Cairo and Suez, and particularly upon all the
hills of Barbary, says the same author, are many
petrified shells and echini; most of them exactly
correspond with the different species still exist∣ing
in the Red Sea. As to Europe, petrisied
fishes are to be met with in Switzerland, Ger∣many,
the quarry of Oningen, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Fossil shells, says M. Bourguet, are to be
found in the long chain of mountains stretch∣ing
from Portugal to the most easterly parts of
China, in the valleys of Europe, and in all the
<PB N="202" REF="237"/>
mountains of Africa and America; and hence,
he remarks, we may conclude, that they also
exist in those parts of the globe with which we
are still unacquainted.</P>
<P>The islands of Europe, of Asia, and of Ame∣rica,
wherever men have had occasion to dig,
whether in the mountains or in the vallies,
furnish many examples of fossil shells; and
this circumstance demonstrates, that islands are
analogous in structure and formation to their
neighbouring continents<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Lettres philos. sur la formation des sels, p. 305.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>These facts are sufficient to prove, that fossil
shells, petrified fishes, and other productions of
the ocean, exist in great quantities in almost
every place where proper investigations have
been made. 'It is true,' says Tancrid Robin∣son,
'that sea-shells are dispersed occasionally
on the earth by armies, and by the inhabitants
of towns and villages. La Loubere relates, in
his voyage to Siam, that the monkeys of the
Cape of Good Hope perpetually amuse them∣selves
in transporting shells from the shores of
the sea to the tops of the mountains. But this
is no solution to the question, why these shells
are dispersed through every climate of the
earth, or why they are found in the bowels of
the highest mountains, and disposed in beds,
like those in the bottom of the ocean.'</P>
<P>Upon perusing an Italian letter, printed at
Paris in the year 1746, concerning the changes
<PB N="203" REF="238"/>
this globe has undergone, I was astonished to
find a repetition of Loubere's sentiments. Pe∣trified
fishes, in the opinion of this writer, are
always of rare species, which were rejected from
the Roman tables, because they were not e∣steemed
to be wholesome: And as to fossil
shells, he says, that the pilgrims brought
from Syria, in the time of the crusades, those
shells peculiar to the Levant, which are now
found petrified in France, in Italy, and in other
parts of Christendom. Why did he not add,
that the monkeys transported shells to the tops
of the highest mountains, which never were
inhabited by men? This he might have done
with great facility, and it would have given an
air of credibility to his hypothesis! How should
men, who pretend to philosophy, differ so wide∣ly
in their opinions? It is not sufficient, it
would appear, to find fossil shells in almost
every part of the earth where pits have been
dug, nor to have quoted the testimonies of na∣tural
historians, as they may, according to cer∣tain
systems, have imagined that shells exist∣ed
where none were to be found: We shall,
therefore, to prevent all prejudices of this kind,
quote the authority of some authors who had
no theory to support, and whose habits of ob∣servation
could only enable them to recognise
shells that were entire, and in the best preserva∣tion.
This testimony will, perhaps, have great∣er
authority with men who cannot judge of the
<PB N="204" REF="239"/>
facts, nor know the distinction between real
shells and their petrifactions.</P>
<P>Every man may examine with his eyes the
banks of shells in the hills round Paris, and e∣specially
in the stone-quarries, as at Chaussée
near Seve, at Isly, Passy, and other places. A
great quantity of lenticular stones are to be
found at Villers-cotterets; the rocks are almost
entirely composed of them; and they are irre∣gularly
interspersed with a kind of cement, by
which they are united. At Chaumont, the
quantity of shells is so great, that the whole
hills, which are pretty high, appear to consist of
nothing else. The same phaenomenon is exhi∣bited
at Courtagnon near Rheims, where there
is a bank of shells of about four leagues broad,
and the length is still more considerable. I
mention these places, because they are famous,
and the shells strike the eyes of every beholder.</P>
<P>With regard to foreign countries, let us at∣tend
to the remarks of travellers.</P>
<P>'In Syria and Phoenicia, in the neighbour∣hood
particularly of Latikea, the rocks are of
a hard chalky substance, from whence the ad∣jacent
city might borrow the name of the
<HI>White Promontory.</HI> The Nakoura, formerly
called the <HI>Scala Tyriorum,</HI> is of the same na∣ture
and complexion; both of them including
a great variety of corals, shells, and other re∣mains
of the deluge<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Shaw's travels, p. 344.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="240"/>
'But fossil shells, and other the like testimo∣nies
of the deluge, are very rare in the moun∣tains
near Sinai, the original menstruum, per∣haps,
of these marbles being too corrosive to
preserve them. Yet, at Corondel, where the
rocks approach nearer to our free-stone, I
found a few chamae and pectunculi, and a cu∣rious
echinus of the discoid kind. The ruins
of the small village at Ain-el-Mousa, and the
several conveyances we have there for water,
are all of them full of fossil shells. The old
walls of Suez, and the remains that are left us
of its harbour, are likewise of the same ma∣terials,
all of them probably from the same
quarry. Between Suez and Cairo, likewise,
and all over the mountains of Lybia, near
Egypt, every little rising ground and hillock
discovers great quantities of the echini, as well
as of the bivalve and turbinated shells, most of
which exactly correspond with their respective
families still preserved in the Red Sea<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Shaw's travels, p. 444.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>The moving sand in the neighbourhood of
Raz Sem, in the kingdom of Barca, covers many
palm-trees, echini, and other petrifactions. <HI>Raz
Seme</HI> signifies <HI>the head of a fish,</HI> and is the name
of what is called the petrified village, where it
has been alledged, that men and women, with
their children, cattle, furniture, &amp;c. may be seen
converted into stone. 'But,' says Mr Shaw,
'all this is mere fiction, as I learned not only
<PB N="206" REF="241"/>
from Mr Mair, Consul at Tripoli, who sent se∣veral
people to examine into the fact, but also
from men of credit and learning who had been
on the spot.'</P>
<P>Near the Pyramids Mr Shaw discovered some
stones that had been hewn by workmen, and
were mixed with little round bodies like lentils,
and some of them resembled barley half peeled.
'These,' he says, 'were supposed to have been
fragments of victuals left by the workmen, and
are now petrified. But this account appears
to be very improbable,' &amp;c. These lentils and
grains of barley are nothing but petrified shells,
known to every naturalist by the name of lentil∣stones.</P>
<P>'Many fossil stones,' says Misson<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Voyage de Misson, tom. 3. p. 109.</NOTE>, 'are
found in the neighbourhood of Maestricht, espe∣cially
near the village of Zichen or Tichen,
and in the mountain called the <HI>Huns.</HI>'</P>
<P>'In the environs of sienne, near Certaldo,
are many mountains of sand filled with diffe∣rent
kinds of shells. Monte-mario, about a
mile from Rome, is also full of them. I have
remarked them in the Alps, in France, and in
other places. Olearius, Steno, Cambden, Speed,
and many other writers, have related the
same phaenomena<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. tom. 2. p. 312.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>'The island of Cerigo,' says Thevenot<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Thevenot, tom. 1. p. 25.</NOTE>,
'was called <HI>Porphyris</HI> by the antients, on ac∣count
<PB N="207" REF="242"/>
of the quantities of porphyry found in
it.' Now, porphyry, as observed above, is
composed of the prickles of the echinus, or sea∣hedge-hog,
united by a very hard stony cement.</P>
<P>'Opposite to Inchené, a village on the
east bank of the Nile, I found petrified plants
growing naturally on a piece of ground about
two leagues in length, and of an inconsiderable
breadth. This is one of the most singular
productions in nature. The plants resembled
the white corals that grow in the Red Sea<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Voyage de Paul Lucas, tom. 2. p. 380.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>'There are several species of petrifactions on
Mount Libanus, and, among others, flat stones
which contain the skeletons of fishes entire,
and well preserved; chesnuts, and small
branches of coral, of the same species with
what grows in the Red Sea, are likewise found
on this mountain<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. tom. 3. p. 326.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>'In mount Carmel,' says Shaw, 'we gather a
great many hollow stones, lined in their insides
with a variety of sparry matter, which, from
some distant resemblance, are said to be petri∣fied
olives, melons, peaches, and other fruit.
These are commonly bestowed upon pilgrims,
not only as curiosities, but as antidotes against
several distempers: The olives, which are the
<HI>lapides Judaici,</HI> as they are commonly called,
have been always looked upon, when dissolved
in the juice of lemons, as an approved medi∣cine
<PB N="208" REF="243"/>
against the stone and gravel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Shaw's travels, p. 444.</NOTE>.' These
<HI>lapides Judaici</HI> are the points of the echinus.</P>
<P>'M. la Roche, a physician, gave me some pe∣trified
olives, called <HI>lapides Judaici,</HI> which
grow in great quantities upon the mountains,
where are to be found, according to my in∣formation,
other stones, which in their inside
contain perfect representations of the natural
parts of men and women<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Voyag. de Monconys, p. 334.</NOTE>.' These are the
hysterolithes.</P>
<P>'In going from Smyrna to Tauris,' says Ta∣vernier,
'when we came to Tocat, the heat was
excessive; we therefore left the common road
to the north of us, and went by the mountains,
where there are always shade and cool breezes.
In many places we found snow; and, upon the
tops of some of these mountains, we saw shells
resembling those upon the sea-shore, which is
an extraordinary phaenomenon.'</P>
<P>Let us attend to what Olearius says concern∣ing
the petrified shells he observed in Persia, and
in the rocks where the sepulchres have been
cut near the village Pyrmaraus.</P>
<P>'Three of us ascended, by mutually assisting
each other, the most frightful precipices, and
at last gained the summit, where we found
four large chambers, with several niches cut
out of the solid rock: But what struck us most
was, to find in this vault, on the top of the
<PB N="209" REF="244"/>
mountain, muscle-shells; and in some parts
they appeared in such quantities, that this
whole rock seemed to consist of nothing but
sand and shells. In returning from Persia,
we perceived several of these shelly mountains
upon the coasts of the Caspian Sea.'</P>
<P>To these authorities many others might be
added, were I not apprehensive of tiring those
who need no additional proofs on this subject,
and who have perceived with their eyes, as I
have done, the existence of shells in all places
where they have been searched for.</P>
<P>In France, we find not only the shells belong∣ing
to our own coasts, but those which never
appeared in our seas. Some philosophers even
alledge, that the number of foreign petrified
shells greatly exceeds those of our own climate.
But this opinion seems not to be well founded;
for, independent of such shells as lie in the bot∣tom
of deep water, and are seldom brought up
by fishers, and, of course, are regarded by us as
foreigners, though they may exist in our seas, I
find, upon comparison, that more of the petrified
shells belong to our own shores than to any
other. For example, all the pectines, most
cockles, muscles, oisters, trumpet-shells, ear∣shells,
limpets, nautili, stars, tubulites, corals,
madrepores, &amp;c. which are found so universally,
are really produced in our seas: And, though
many sea-bodies appear, which are either foreign
or unknown, as the cornu ammonis, the lapi∣des
<PB N="210" REF="245"/>
Judaici, the large screw, the buccinum cal∣led
<HI>abajour,</HI> &amp;c. yet I am convinced, by repeat∣ed
observation, that the number of these spe∣cies
is inconsiderable, when compared with the
shells which belong to our own coasts. Beside,
the madrepores, astroites, and all those sea-bodies
formed by insects, constitute the basis of our
marbles and lime-stone; for the shells, however
abundant, make but a small part of these stones,
and many of them are produced in our own
seas, and particularly in the Mediterranean.</P>
<P>The Red Sea produces corals, madrepores,
and sea-plants, more abundantly than any other.
The port of Tor furnishes an amazing quantity;
in calm weather, the quantity exhibited is so
great, that the bottom of the sea resembles a
forest: Some of the branched madrepores rise
from eight to ten feet high. They are also
very common in the different parts of the Me∣diterranean;
and are to be found in all gulfs,
islands, &amp;c. of every temperate climate, where
the sea is not very deep.</P>
<P>Mr Peyssonel was the first who discovered
that coral, madrepores, &amp;c. were not plants, but
that they derived their origin from animals.
The truth of this discovery was long doubted:
Some naturalists at first rejected it with dis∣drain.
But it soon gained universal assent; and
every man is now satisfied, that what was for∣merly
called sea-plants, are nothing but hives,
or rather lodges, formed by insects for their own
<PB N="211" REF="246"/>
habitation. These bodies were originally classed
with minerals, then with plants, and now they
must for ever be recognised as the genuine ope∣ration
of animals.</P>
<P>Many shell fish inhabit the deepest parts of
the ocean, and are never thrown upon the coasts;
authors have, therefore, termed them <HI>Pelagiae,</HI>
to distinguish them from the other kinds which
they call <HI>Littorales.</HI> It is probable that the cornu
ammonis, and some other species, found only in
a petrified state, belong to the former, and that
they have been impregnated with stony matter
in the very places where they are discovered. It
is also probable, that the species of some animals
have been extinguished, and that these shells
may be ranked among this number. The ex∣traordinary
fossil bones found in Siberia, in Ca∣nada,
in Ireland, and several other places, seem
to confirm this conjecture; for no animal has
hitherto been discovered to whom bones of such
enormous size could possibly belong.</P>
<P>Fossil shells, says Woodward, are found from
the top to the bottom of quarries, in pits, and in
the deepest mines of Hungary: And we are in∣formed
by Mr Ray, that they are found in the
rocks on the shores of Calda, and in Pembroke∣shire,
at the depth of 200 fathoms<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Ray's discourses, p. 178.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Shells not only appear in a petrified state at
great depths, and on the tops of the highest
mountains, but they are also found in their na∣tural
<PB N="212" REF="247"/>
condition, having the colour, lustre, and
lightness of sea-shells; so that, to be fully satis∣fied
on this subject, nothing farther is requisite
than to compare them with the shells found on
the shores of the sea. The slightest examina∣tion
will convince us, that petrified and fossil
shells are precisely the same with those of the
ocean; for they are marked with the same fur∣rows
and articulations, however minute; and,
in the glossopetri and other teeth of fishes, which
are sometimes found adhering to the jaw-bone,
it is obvious to remark, that the teeth are worn
and polished at the extremities, and that they
have been used by the living animals.</P>
<P>Fossil shells are almost every where to be met
with; and, of those of the same species, some
are small, others large, some young, others old,
some entire, others imperfect; and sometimes
young ones appear adhering to the old.</P>
<P>The shell-fish called <HI>Purpura,</HI> has a long
tongue, the extremity of which is so sharp and
osseous, that it pierces the shells of other fishes,
in order to extract nourishment from them,
Shells pierced in this manner are often found
in the bowels of the earth; which is an incon∣testible
proof that they were formerly inhabited
by living fishes, and that they existed in the same
places with the purpura<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Woodward, p. 296. 300.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The obelisks of St Peter's at Rome, accor∣ding
to John of Latran, were said to have been
<PB N="213" REF="248"/>
brought from the Egyptian pyramids: They
consist of a red granite, whiche, as formerly re∣marked,
contains no shells. But the antient
marbles of Africa and Egypt, and the porphyry
said to have been brought from Solomon's
temple, and the palaces of the Egyptian kings,
and employed in several of the Roman buildings,
are full of shells. Red porphyry is composed
of an infinite number of the prickles of that
species of echinus called a sea-chesnut; they
are placed very near each other, and form the
white points of the porphyry. Each of these
points have a black speck in the middle, which
is the section of the longitudinal tube of
the prickle of the echinus. At Ficin in Burgun∣dy,
three leagues from Dijon, there is a red stone
so similar to porphyry, that it differs only in
density, not being harder than marble: It is en∣tirely
composed of the points or prickles of the
echini, and the stratum of it is considerable both
in thickness and extent. Many excellent pieces
of workmanship are made of it in this province,
and particularly the steps that lead to the pedestal
of the equestrian statue of Louis le Grand at
Dijon. This species of stone is also found in
Montbard in Burgundy; it is softer than marble;
but it contains still more prickles of the echini,
and a smaller proportion of red matter. Thus
the antient porphyry of Egypt, and the por∣phyry
of Burgundy, differ only in the de∣gree▪
of hardness, and in the quantity of
<PB N="214" REF="249"/>
prickles or points of the echinus contained in
them.</P>
<P>With regard to what is called green porphyry,
I imagine it to be rather a granite than a por∣phyry.
It is not, like the red porphyry, com∣posed
of the prickles of the echinus; and its
substance resembles more that of common gra∣nite.
The antient walls of Volatera in Tuscany,
have been built of stones in which are many
shells, and this wall was built 2500 years ago<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Steno de solido intra solidum, p. 63.</NOTE>.
Most marbles, porphyries, and other stones em∣ployed
in the buildings of the antients, contain
shells, and other productions of the ocean, in the
same manner as some of our modern marbles.
Hence we conclude with safety, that, indepen∣dent
of the testimony of holy writ, the earth,
before the deluge, was composed of the same
materials that it is at present.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, it is apparent, that petrified
shells are found in Europe, in Asia, in Africa,
and in every place where proper researches have
been made. They are also found in America,
in the Brasils, for example, in Tucumama, in
Terra Magellanica, and in such vast quantities in
the Antilles, that what the inhabitants call lime,
which lies immediately below the soil, is nothing
but a congeries of shells, corals, madrepores,
astroites, and other sea-bodies. These incon∣testible
facts would have led me to conclude,
that petrified shells, and other productions of the
<PB N="215" REF="250"/>
ocean, were to be found through the whole
continent of America, and especially in the moun∣tains,
as is affirmed by Woodward. But M. de
la Condamine, who lived several years in Peru,
assures me, that he was never able to discover
any of them in the Cordeliers, although he had
diligently searched for them. This phaeno∣menon
would indeed be singular, and would lead
to conclusions still more singular. But, I con∣fess,
the testimony of this celebrated observer
notwithstanding, I am strongly inclined to be∣lieve
that there is, in the mountains of Peru, as
well as every where else, petrified shells and other
sea-bodies, although they have not yet been dis∣covered.
In matters that depend on testimony,
the positive evidence of two witnesses is a com∣pleat
proof; but the evidence of ten thousand
witnesses, who only declare in the negative, that
they never observed a particular appearance, give
rise to nothing more than a slight doubt. Thus
reason, joined to the force of a general analogy,
obliges me to persist in believing that fossil shells
will still be found in the mountains of Peru, e∣specially
if they be searched for in the sides, and
not on the very summits.</P>
<P>The tops of high mountains are generally
composed of granite, free-stone, and other vitri∣fiable
materials, which never contain shells.
These matters were all formed out of beds of
sand, when they were covered by the sea. But,
when the waters left the mountains, they would
<PB N="216" REF="251"/>
carry off the sand, and other light bodies, into the
plains, and leave nothing on their tops but those
beds of rock which had been formed below the
stratum of sand. At two, three, or four hun∣dred
fathom below the summit of these moun∣tains,
we often find marbles and other calcinable
matters, disposed in parallel beds, and contain∣ing
shells and other sea-bodies. Hence, if M.
de la Condamine examined only the most ele∣vated
places, which consist of granite, of free∣stone,
or of vitrifiable sand, it is not surprising
that he did not find fossil shells. But he ought
to have explored the lower parts of the Corde∣liers,
and he would unquestionably have disco∣vered
beds of marble, earth, &amp;c. mixed with
shells; for such beds have been found in every
part of the world that has undergone a proper
examination.</P>
<P>But, supposing it to be a fact, that there are
no productions of the ocean in the mountains of
Peru, nothing could be concluded from it that
would affect our theory. Some parts of the
globe, and particularly places of such elevation
as the Cordeliers, might never have been cover∣ed
with the sea. These mountains, however,
would be an ample field for curious observation.
They would not, in that case, consist of parallel
beds. Their materials would be very different
from all others: They would have no perpen∣dicular
fissures: The structure of the stones and
rocks would have no resemblance to those of
<PB N="217" REF="252"/>
other countries: <HI>Lastly,</HI> These mountains would
exhibit the antient structure of the earth before
it was changed by the motion of the waters;
they would discover the primitive state of the
globe, its original form, the natural arrangement
and connection of its parts. But this notion is
supported by too slender a foundation; and it is
more consonant to the rules of philosophy to
believe that fossil shells exist in the mountains
of Peru, in the same manner as they exist every
where else.</P>
<P>With regard to the position of shells in beds
of earth or of stone, let us attend to the follow∣ing
passage of Woodward: 'All the shells that
are found in numberless strata of earth, and
rocks, in the highest mountains, and in the
most profound quarries and mines, in flint,
cornelian, agate, &amp;c. and in masses of sulphur,
marcasites, and other mineral and metallic bo∣dies,
are filled with the same substances that
compose the strata in which they are included,
and never with any heterogeneous matter;'
p. 206. &amp;c.—'We now find in the sand∣stone
of all countries (the specific gravity of
the several sorts whereof is very little different,
being generally to water as 2½ or 2 9/10 to 1)
only those conchae, pectines, cochleae, and
other shells that are nearly of the same gra∣vity,
viz. 2½ or 2 5/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to 1. But these are ordi∣narily
found enclosed in it in prodigious num∣bers;
whereas, of oister-shells, (which are in
<PB N="218" REF="253"/>
gravity but as about 2⅓ to 1) of echini, (which
are but as 2, or 2⅛ to 1) or the other lighter
kinds of shells, scarce one ever appears therein.
On the contrary, in chalk (which is lighter
than stone, being but as about 2 1/10 to 1) there
are only found echini, and the other lighter
sorts of shells;' p. 32. 33.</P>
<P>It must here be remarked, that what Wood∣ward
says with respect to specific gravity, is not
universally true; for shells of different specific
gravities are often found in the same matters;
shells of cockles, of oisters, and of echini, for
example, are found in the same bed of stones or
of earth. In the cabinet of the French King,
there is a cockle petrified in a cornelian, and
echini petrified in an agate. Hence the difference
in the specific gravity of shells has had less in∣fluence
upon their position in the strata of the
earth than Woodward would have us to believe.
The reason why the shells of the echini, and
others of a light texture, abound so much in
chalk, is owing to this circumstance, that chalk
itself is only decomposed shells; those of the
echini being lighter and thinner than others,
would be most easily reduced to powder or
chalk; and hence beds of chalk could only exist
in those places where were formerly collected
by the sea great quantities of light shells, the de∣struction
of which would form that chalk in
which we still find shells that have resisted the
<PB N="219" REF="254"/>
operation of time, either in an entire state, or in
fragments sufficient to discover their species.</P>
<P>This subject shall be treated more fully in the
article of Minerals; I shall here only observe,
that Woodward's expressions are often too ge∣neral.
He appears to assert, that shells are
found as frequently, and in as great abundance,
in flints, cornelians, calcedonii, ores, and sul∣phur,
as in other matters. But the fact is, that
shells are a very rare phaenomenon in vitrifiable
or purely inflammable substances; and, in chalk,
marle, and marbles, the quantity of them is so
prodigious, that it is impossible to affirm that the
lighter and heavier shells are uniformly found in
strata corresponding to their specific gravities,
though, in general, this may be the case oftener
than otherwise. They are all impregnated with
the bodies in which they are immersed, whe∣ther
in the horizontal beds, or in the perpendi∣cular
fissures, because the whole has been effec∣ted
by the operation of water, though at differ∣ent
times and in different manners. Those found
in the horizontal beds of stone, marble, &amp;c.
have been transported and deposited by the
waves of the sea; and those found in flints,
cornelians, and other substances peculiar to the
perpendicular fissures, were formed by rills of
water impregnated with lapidific or metallic
substances. In both cases, the matter that fills
the shells has been in the state of a fine impal∣pable
<PB N="220" REF="255"/>
powder; because every pore of them is
compleatly filled, and the moulds of them are as
exact as the impressions of a seal upon wax.</P>
<P>It is, therefore, apparent, that, in stone, marble,
&amp;c. there are multitudes of shells so entire, and
so well preserved, that they may be compared
with those in our cabinets, or upon the shores of
the sea.</P>
<P>'There being, I say, besides these, such vast
multitudes of shells contained in stone, &amp;c.
which are entire, fair, and absolutely free from
any such mineral contagion; which are to be
matched by others at this day found upon our
shores, and which do not differ in any respect
from them; being of the same size that those
are of, and the same shape precisely; of the
same substance and texture, as consisting of the
same peculiar matter, and this constituted and
disposed in the same manner as is that of their
respective fellow-kinds at sea; the tendency
of the fibres and striae the same; the compo∣sition
of the lamellae, constituted by these
fibres, alike in both; the same vestigia of ten∣dons
(by means whereof the animal is fasten∣ed
and joined to the shell) in each; the same
papillae; the same futures, and every thing
else, whether within or without the shell, in
its cavity, or upon its convexity, in the sub∣stance,
or upon the surface of it. Besides,
these fossil, shells are attended with the ordi∣nary
<PB N="221" REF="256"/>
accidents of the marine ones, ex. gr. they
sometimes grow to one another, the lesser shells
being fixed to the larger: They have balani, tu∣buli
vermiculares, pearls, and the like, still actu∣ally
growing upon them. And, which is very
considerable, they are most exactly of the same
specific gravity with their fellow-kinds now
upon the shores. Nay farther, they answer
all chymical trials in like manner as the sea∣shells
do; their parts, when dissolved, have
the same appearance to view, the same smell
and taste<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Woodward, p. 23. 24.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>I have often observed, with astonishment,
whole mountains, chains of rocks, and extensive
quarries, so full of shells, and other sea-bodies,
that there was hardly space left for the matters
in which they are deposited.</P>
<P>I have seen some arable fields so full of pe∣trified
cockles, that they might be picked up by
a blind man, others entirely covered with cornu
ammonis, and others with cardites; and the more
this subject is inquired into, we shall be the more
thoroughly convinced, that the number of pe∣trifactions
is infinite, and that it was absolutely
impossible that all the animals which inhabited
these shells could exist at the same time.</P>
<P>I have farther remarked, that the stones of
those arable lands which abound with petrified
shells in an entire form, well preserved, and de∣tached
from all other matter, are frittered down
<PB N="222" REF="257"/>
by frost, which destroys stones, but has little ef∣fect
upon petrified shells.</P>
<P>These immense quantities of petrified sea∣bodies,
found in so many different places and si∣tuations,
prove, that they could not be transport∣ed
and deposited by the waters of the deluge;
for the greatest part of them, instead of being
found in the bowels of the earth, and in solid
marble at the depth of seven or eight hundred
feet, behoved to have remained on the surface.</P>
<P>In all quarries, petrified shells form part of
the internal structure of the stone, the surface
of which is often covered with stalactites, a
matter much less antient than the stone that
contains the shells. Another proof that these
shells could not be derived from the deluge is,
that the bones, horns, claws, &amp;c. of land-ani∣mals
are seldom found in a petrified state, and
are never incorporated in marble, or other hard
stones; whereas, if these effects had been pro∣duced
by the deluge, the remains of land-ani∣mals
would have been found in marbles, as well
as those of fishes.</P>
<P>To alledge, that the earth was entirely dissol∣ved
at the time of the deluge, is a mere gratui∣tous
suppsition, which required a second miracle
in order to give water the power of an univer∣sal
dissolvent. Besides, it infers an evident con∣tradiction;
for, if water was then an universal
menstruum, how could shells have been pre∣served
in the entire state in which we find them?
<PB N="223" REF="258"/>
This is an evident demonstration, that no such
dissolution took place, and that the parallel strata
were not formed in an instant, but were gradu∣ally
produced by successive sediments; for, it is
apparent to every observer, that the disposition
of all the materials composing the earth has been
occasioned by the operation of water. The on∣ly
question, therefore, that remains, is, whether
this arrangement of parts was produced all at
once, or in a succession of time? Now, it has
already been shown, that it could not possibly
happen at one time; because the materials are
not disposed according to their specific gravities,
and because they never suffered a general disso∣lution.
This arrangement, therefore, must have
originated from successive sediments. Any other
cause, or particular revolution, would have gi∣ven
rise to an arrangement totally different. Be∣sides,
particular revolutions, or accidental causes,
could never have produced a uniform disposi∣tion
of horizontal and parallel strata throughout
the whole globe.</P>
<P>Let us attend to what the historian of the
Academy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Année 1718, p. 3.</NOTE> has said upon this subject.</P>
<P>'The many marks of extensive inundations,
and the manner in which mountains must be
conceived to have been produced, demonstrate,
that the surface of this earth has suffered great
revolutions. However deep we penetrate in∣to
<PB N="224" REF="259"/>
to the globe, we discover nothing but ruins,
bodies of different kinds amassed and incor∣porated
without any order or apparent design.
If there be any regularity in the structure of
the earth, it lies too deep for our researches;
we must, therefore, confine ourselves to the
ruins of the external crust, which will be suf∣ficent
to occupy the attention of philosophers.'</P>
<P>'M. de Jussieu discovered, in the neighbour∣hood
of St Chaumont, a great quantity of
slaty or laminated stones, every lamina of
which was marked with the impression of a
stem, leaf, or other portion of some plant. In
the impressions of leaves, they were uniform∣ly
extended, as if they had been streached in
the stones by the hand; a clear demonstration
that they had been transported by water,
which always keeps leaves in that position:
Their situations were various, and sometimes
they lay across each other.'</P>
<P>'It is natural to imagine, that a leaf deposi∣ted
by water upon soft mud, and then cover∣ed
by a similar layer of mud, would impress
upon the lowermost layer the figure of its one
side, and upon the uppermost the figure of its
opposite side; and, after these layers hardened
and petrified, that they would each bear an
impression of a different side of the leaf. But
this supposition, however natural, does not
take place: The two laminae of stone uni∣formly
<PB N="225" REF="260"/>
formly bear the impression of the same side
of the leaf, the one in alto, the other in bass∣relief.
For this observation, with regard to
the figured stones of St Chaumont, we are in∣debted
to M. de Jussieu; but we leave the ex∣plication
of it to himself, and shall proceed to
remarks of a more general and interesting na∣ture.'</P>
<P>'All the impressions on the stones of Saint
Chaumont are of foreign plants, which are
not to be found in any part of France; they
are natives either of the East Indies, or of the
warmer climates of America. Most of them
belong to the capillary tribes, and they are ge∣nerally
particular species of ferns, the close
texture of which enables them both to make
deep impressions, and to remain long in a state
of preservation. M. Leibnitz was astonished
to find the impressions of the leaves of a few
East India plants upon some stones in Ger∣many:
In the example under consideration,
the wonder is greatly augmented; for, by
some unaccountable destination of nature, it
would appear, in all the stones of Saint Chau∣mont,
not a single impression of a native plant
is to be found.'</P>
<P>'From the number of fossil shells in the
mountains and quarries exhibited in this coun∣try,
as well as in many others, it is apparent,
that it must have formerly been covered with
<PB N="226" REF="261"/>
the sea. But how could the American or In∣dian
oceans come hither?'</P>
<P>'To solve this and other surprising phaeno∣mena,
we may suppose, with much probabi∣lity,
that the sea originally covered the whole
globe. But this supposition will not answer;
because no terrestrial plants could then exist:
The plants of one country, therefore, could
only be transported to another by great inun∣dations.'</P>
<P>'M. de Jussieu imagines, that, as the bed of
the sea is always rising higher by means of the
mud and sand incessantly carried into it by the
rivers, the sea, at first confined by natural dikes,
might at last surmount them, and spread over
the land to great distances; or, which would
produce the same effect, the dikes might in
time be rendered so thin, by the constant ope∣ration
of the water, that they would at last
give way. Soon after the formation of the
earth, when nothing had assumed a regular
or settled form, sudden and prodigious revo∣lutions
might then be produced, of which we
have now no examples, because every thing
is in such a fixed and permanent state, that
only slow and inconsiderable changes can take
place: It is for this reason that we find a dif∣ficulty
in crediting revolutions more sudden
and tremendous.'</P>
<P>'By some of these great revolutions the West
<PB N="227" REF="262"/>
or East Indian Oceans might have been poured
in upon Europe: In their journey, they would
tear up foreign plants, carry them off floating
on the waves, and gently deposite them in
shallow places, from which the waters would
soon evaporate.'</P>

<HEAD>PROOFS
OF THE
THEORY OF THE EARTH.</HEAD>
<HEAD>ARTICLE IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the Inequalities upon the Earth's Surface.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the inequalities upon the surface
of the earth may be considered as a defor∣mity
in its figure, they are absolutely necessary to
vegetation and animal life. To be convinced of
this, we need only consider what would be
the condition of the earth, were its surface per∣fectly
smooth and regular. Instead of those
beautiful hills which furnish abundance of wa∣ter
for supporting the verdure of the earth, in∣stead
of those richly garnished fields, where
plants and animals find an easy and comforta∣ble
subsistence, a dreary ocean would cover the
whole globe, and the earth, deprived of all its
<PB N="229" REF="264"/>
valuable and alluring qualities, would be an
obscure, abandoned planet, suited only for the
habitation of fishes.</P>
<P>But, independent of moral considerations,
which seldom ought to be employed in natural
philosophy, the surface must, from a physical
necessity, have been irregular; for, supposing it
to have been originally smooth and level, the
motion of the waters, subterraneous fires, the
winds, and other external causes, would neces∣sarily
produce, in time, irregularities similar to
those which we now behold.</P>
<P>Next to the elevation of mountains, the depths
of the ocean form the greatest inequalities. This
depth is exceedingly diversified, even at great
distances from land. In some places the sea is
said to be a league in depth; but that is a rare
phaenomenon; and the most common depths
are from 60 to 150 fathoms. Gulfs and branches
of the ocean that run in upon the land, are still
less deep; and straits are generally the most
shallow places.</P>
<P>Depths are commonly sounded by a piece of
lead, 30 or 40 pounds weight, fixed to a small
rope. This method answers well enough for or∣dinary
depths, but is liable to error when the
depth is very great; for the cord being specifi∣cally
lighter than water, after much of it has
been wound down, the weight of the lead and
that of the cord become nearly equal to their
bulks of water; then the lead descends no more,
<PB N="230" REF="265"/>
but runs off in an oblique line, and floats at the
same depth. Hence, in sounding great depths,
an iron chain, or some body heavier than water,
should be employed. It is for want of atten∣tion
to this circumstance, that some navigators
have been led to maintain, that the sea, in ma∣ny
places, has no bottom.</P>
<P>In general, the depths in open seas augment
or diminish in a pretty regular manner, being
commonly deeper the farther from land. But
to this remark there are many exceptions; for
there are places in the middle of the sea, as at
the <HI>Abrolhos</HI> in the Atlantic, where large shelves
appear; and there are, in other places, vast
sand-banks, well known to the mariners who sail
to the East Indies.</P>
<P>Along coasts, the depths are likewise very irre∣gular.
However, it may be laid down as a cer∣tain
rule, that the depth is always proportioned
to the height of the coast: The same observation
applies to rivers.</P>
<P>It is easy to measure the height of mountains,
either geometrically or by the barometer. This
instrument determines the height of a mountain
pretty exactly, especially in countries where its
variation is not considerable, as at Peru and o∣ther
equatorial climates. By one or other of
these methods, the height of most mountains has
already been ascertained; for example, it has
been found, that the highest mountains of Swit∣zerland
exceed Canigau, the most elevated of
<PB N="231" REF="266"/>
the Pyrennees, 1600 fathoms<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Hist. de l'Acad. 1708, p. 24.</NOTE>. These moun∣tains
appear to be the highest in Europe, since
they give rise to a great number of rivers which
run into different and very distant seas, as the
Po, which empties itself in the Adriatic, the
Rhine, which loses itself in the sands of Hol∣land,
the Rhone, which falls into the Mediter∣ranean,
and the Danube, which runs into the
Black Sea. These four rivers, the mouths of
which are so distant, derive part of their waters
from Saint Godard and the neighbouring moun∣tains;
a clear proof that this place is the most ele∣vated
part of Europe.</P>
<P>Mount Taurus, Imaus, Caucasus, and the
mountains of Japan, are higher than any in Eu∣rope.
The mountains of Africa, as the great
Atlas, and the mountains of the Moon, are at
least equally high with those of Asia; and the
highest of all are those of South America, and
especially of Peru, which are 3000 fathoms above
the level of the sea. In general, the tropical
mountains are more elevated than those of the
temperate zones, and the latter are higher than
those nearer the poles. Thus, the nearer the
Equator, the greater are the superficial inequali∣ties,
which, though considerable with regard to
us, are nothing when estimated in relation to the
whole globe. A difference of 3000 fathoms in 3000
leagues diameter, is but a fathom to a league, or a
foot to 2200 feet, and, upon a globe of 2½ feet,
<PB N="232" REF="267"/>
would not make the 16th part of a French line.
Hence this earth, which to us appears to be tra∣versed
and intersected by mountains of an enor∣mous
height, and by seas of a dreadful depth,
is, in relation to its size, but slightly furrowed
with inequalities so inconsiderable, that they can∣not
make any variation upon its general figure.</P>
<P>The mountains, in continents, form continued
chains; but, in islands, they are more interrupt∣ed,
generally rise in the form of a cone, or py∣ramid,
and are distinguished by the name of
peaks. The Peak of Teneriffe, in the Island of
Fer, is one of the highest mountains in the earth;
it is nearly a league and a half perpendicular a∣bove
the level of the sea. The Peak of St
George in one of the Azores, and the Peak of
Adam, in the Island of Ceylon, are likewise ex∣ceedingly
high. These peaks are composed of
rocks, piled above each other; and all of them
throw out, from their summits, fire, ashes, bitu∣men,
minerals, and stones. Some islands, as St
Helena, Ascension Isle, and most of the Canaries
and Azores, are only the tops or points of moun∣tains.
It is also worthy of remark, that the
middle of most islands, promontories, and capes,
is the most elevated, and that they are generally
divided into two parts, by chains of mountains
which run in the direction of their greatest
length: In Scotland, for example, the Grampian
mountains (Grans-bain) extend from east to
west, and divide the Island of Great Britain into
<PB N="233" REF="268"/>
two parts: The same thing takes place in Su∣matra,
the Lucca Islands, Borneo, Celebes, Cuba,
St Domingo, the peninsulas of Corea and Ma∣laya,
&amp;c. Italy is also longitudinally traversed
by the Appennines.</P>
<P>Mountains, as mentioned above, are of differ∣ent
heights; the hills are lowest; then follow
the mountains of an ordinary height, which
are succeeded by a third range still higher. All
these are commonly covered with trees and plants;
but neither of them furnish springs excepting at
their bottoms. In the last and highest range,
we find nothing but sand, loose stones, flints,
and rocks, the tops of which often reach above
the clouds. Precisely at the foot of these rocks,
are little plains, or hollows, which collect rains
and snow, and form those ponds, morasses, or
fountains, from which the rivers derive their
sources<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Lettres philosophiques fur la formation des fels, &amp;c. p. 198.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The figure of mountains is likewise very dif∣ferent.
Some consist of long chains of nearly
an equal height; others are intersected by deep
vallies; the contours of some mountains are
pretty uniform; those of others are most irre∣gular,
and sometimes a detached little mountain
appears in the middle of a plain or valley. There
are also two kinds of plains; some occupy the
low grounds, and others appear in the moun∣tains.
The former are generally divided by
some large river; but the latter, though their
<PB N="234" REF="269"/>
extent be considerable, are dry, or furnished with
only a small rill. The plains in the mountains
are often exceedingly high, always of difficult
access, and form one country above another, as
in Auvergne, Savoy, and other elevated pro∣vinces.
The soil of them is firm, and produces
plenty of herbs and odoriferous plants, which
renders them the finest pasture-grounds in the
world.</P>
<P>The tops of high mountains are composed of
rocks of different elevations, which, when view∣ed
at a distance, make them resemble the waves
of the sea<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See ibid. p. 196.</NOTE>. This is not the only reason for
our affirming that mountains were formed by
the motions of the sea; I only mention it, be∣cause
it corresponds with every other phaeno∣menon.
But the following facts put this point
beyond all controversy: The fossil shells, and
other sea-bodies, every where found in such
profusion, that they could not possibly be trans∣ported
from the sea, in its present state, into
continents so distant, and deposited at such great
depths in the bowels of the mountains: The
universal parallelism of the different strata, an
effect which could only be produced by water,
and the composition even of the most dense of
them, as those of stone and marble, which clear∣ly
evinces, that, before their formation, they had
been reduced into a fine powder, and precipi∣tated
to the bottom in the form of sediments:
<PB N="235" REF="270"/>
The exactness with which the fossil shells are
moulded in the matters in which they are found:
The cavities of fossil shells, which are uniform∣ly
filled with the same substances that contain
them: The corresponding angles of hills and
mountains, which nothing could effect but the
currents of the ocean: The equality in the
heights of opposite hills, and the different strata
uniformly appearing at the same levels: And,
lastly, the direction of mountains, the chains of
which extend longitudinally, like the waves of
the sea.</P>
<P>With regard to the depths or hollows on the
surface of the earth, those of the ocean are un∣questionably
the greatest. But, as these are hid
from human view, and can only be discovered
by sounding, we shall confine ourselves to those
which appear on the dry land, such as deep val∣lies,
precipices found between rocks, abysses
that present themselves in high mountains, as the
abyss of Mount Ararat, the precipices of the
Alps, the vallies of the Pyrennees, &amp;c. These
depths are a natural consequence of the elevation
of mountains; they receive the water and earth
carried down from the high grounds; their
soil is generally fertile; and they are full of in∣habitants.
The precipices among rocks are of∣ten
occasioned by a sudden sinking of one side,
the base, which generally inclines more one way
than another, being loosened by the action
of the air, and of frost, or by the violence of
<PB N="236" REF="271"/>
torrents. But abysses, or those enormous pre∣cipices
that appear on the tops of some moun∣tains,
and, to the bottom of which, though their
circumference be a mile and a half, or three
miles round, it is impossible to descend, have
been formed by the operation of fire. They
have been the furnaces of antient volcano's, the
matter of which has been exhausted by explo∣sions
and the long action of fires, which are
now extinguished from the want of combustible
matter. Of this kind is the abyss of Mount
Ararat, described by Tournefort. It is surround∣ed
with rocks that are black and burned. The
abysses of Aetna and of Vesuvius will have the
same appearance after their inflammable mate∣rials
are exhausted.</P>
<P>In Plot's history of the country of Stafford in
England, there is an account of a kind of gulf,
which was sounded by a rop of 2600 feet, with∣out
finding either watter or bottom, the rop
being too short<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Journal des Savans, 1680, p. 12.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The greatest cavities, and the deepest mines,
are generally in the mountains, and they seldom
descend to the level of the plains; and we dis∣cover
by them the internal structure of the
mountain only, not that of the globe itself.</P>
<P>Besides, these depths are not very considerable.
Mr Ray affirms, that the deepest mines exceed
not half a mile. The mine of Cotteberg, which,
in the time of Agricola, was esteemed to be the
<PB N="237" REF="272"/>
deepest in the world, was only 2500 feet of
perpendicular depth. There are, indeed, holes
in particular places, as that mentioned by Plot,
or Pool's hole in the county of Derby, the depth
of which is probably very great: But none of
them bear any sensible proportion to the thick∣ness
of the globe.</P>
<P>If the kings of Egypt, in place of erecting
pyramids as monuments of their vanity and
riches, had expended equal sums in making pro∣found
excavations into the bowels of the earth,
to the depth of perhaps a league, they might
have discovered substances which would have
recompensed their labour; they would at least
have extended the knowledge of the earth's in∣ternal
structure, which might have been pro∣ductive
of much utility.</P>
<P>But, let us return to the mountains. The
highest of them lie between the tropics; and
the nearer we approach to the equator, the
greater are the inequalities on the earth's sur∣face.
A short enumeration of mountains and
islands will be sufficient to establish this point.</P>
<P>In America, the Cordeliers, which are the
highest mountains in the world, lie precisely
under the equator, and they extend on both sides
a considerable way beyond the Tropic circles.</P>
<P>The highest mountains of the Moon, of Mo∣nomotapa,
and the great and little Atlas, in
Africa, lie either under or very near the equa∣tor.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="273"/>
In Asia, Mount Caucasus, the chain of which,
under different names, runs into China, and,
through this whole extent, lies nearer the equa∣tor
than the poles.</P>
<P>In Europe, the Pyrennees, the Alps, and the
mountains of Greece, which form one chain,
are still less distant from the equator than the
pole.</P>
<P>These chains of mountains, of which we
have given an enumeration, are higher, and of
greater extent, both in length and in breadth,
than those of more northern countries. With
regard to their direction, the Alps form a con∣tinued
chain which runs across the whole Con∣tinent
from Spain to China. They commence
on the sea-coast of Galicia, join the Pyrennees,
traverse France, by Vivares and Auvergne, run
through Italy, and stretch into Germany, above
Dalmatia, until they reach Macedonia; from
thence they join the mountains of Armenia,
the Caucasus, the Taurus, the Imaus, and at
last terminate on the coast of Tartary. Mount
Atlas, in the same manner, traverses the whole
Continent of Africa, from the kingdom of Fez
to the straits of the Red Sea. The mountains
of the Moon have likewise the same direction.</P>
<P>But the mountains of America have an oppo∣site
direction. The vast chains of Cordeliers,
and other mountains, run more from south to
north than from east to west.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="274"/>
What we have now remarked concerning the
greatest elevations of the land, applies equally to
the greatest depths of the sea. The most exten∣sive
and deepest seas lie nearer the equator than
the poles: From these united observations, the
truth of our general position, that the greatest
inequalities of the globe are to be found in the
equatorial regions, is sufficiently established.
These irregularities on the surface of the earth
give rise to a number of curious phaenomena.
Between the Indus and the Ganges, for example,
there is a large peninsula, through the middle
of which runs a chain of high mountains, called
the <HI>Gate,</HI> which extends, from north to south,
from the extremity of Mount Caucasus to Cape
Comorin; one side of this peninsula forms the
coast of Malabar, the other that of Coromandel.
On the Malabar side, between the chain of
mountains and the sea, the season of summer is
from September to April; and, during these
months, the sky is serene, and no rain falls.
But, on the Coromandel coast, which lies on the
other side of the mountains, this very period is
their winter, and the rains fall abundantly.
This reverse of summer and winter happens in
some places no farther distant than 20 leagues;
so that, by crossing the mountains, a man has it
in his power to change seasons. The same thing,
it is said, takes place at Cape Razalgat in Arabia,
and even in Jamaica, which is divided from east
to west by a chain of mountains; on the south
<PB N="240" REF="275"/>
side of these mountains, the plantations enjoy
the warmth of summer, while those on the north
suffer all the rigours of winter. Peru, which is
situated under the line, and extends about 1000
leagues towards the south, is divided into three
long and narrow portions, called by the inha∣bitants
<HI>Lanos, Sierras,</HI> and <HI>Andes.</HI> The Lanos,
which are the plains, extend along the coast of
the South Sea; the Sierras are hills interspersed
with vallies; and the Andes are the famous Cor∣deliers,
the highest mountains in the world. The
Lanos are about 10 leagues broad; the Sierras,
in many places, 20 leagues; and the Andes
nearly the same, though some parts of them are
more, and others less broad. The breadth of
these divisions is from east to west, and their
length from south to north. This part of the
world exhibits the following remarkable ap∣pearances:
1<HI>st,</HI> Along the whole coast of the
Lanos, a south-west wind almost constantly
blows, which is contrary to the ordinary direc∣tion
of the wind in the Torrid Zone. 2<HI>d,</HI> In
the Lanos, it never rains or thunders, though
they have plentiful dews. 3<HI>d,</HI> It rains almost
continually in the Andes. 4<HI>th,</HI> In the Sierras,
which lie between the Lanos and the Andes, it

<P>It was long thought, that all high mountains
run from west to east, till the contrary direction
was discovered in America. But M. Bourguet
was the first who remarked the surprising re∣gularity
<PB N="241" REF="276"/>
in the structure of these great masses.
After passing the Alps thirty times in fourteen
different places, the Apennines twice, and ma∣king
several tours in the neighbourhood of these
mountains, and of Mount Jura, he found, that
the contours of all mountains have a near re∣semblance
to the works in regular fortifications.
When the direction of a mountain is from west
to east, all its projections, or advances, stretch
to the south and north. This amazing regula∣rity
is so remarkable in the vallies, that one is
apt to imagine that he is walking in a covered
way. If, for example, a man travels in a val∣ley
from north to south, he perceives that the
mountain which lies to the right hand makes
projections to the east, and that the projections
of the opposite mountain regard the west, in
such a manner, that the prominent and concave
angles, on each side, alternately correspond with
one another. When the vallies are large, the
angles of the mountains are less acute, because
they are more distant from each other, and the
declivity is not so rapid or steep. These angles
are not perceptible in plains, excepting when we
station ourselves on the banks of the rivers,
which generally occupy the middle of them,
and whose natural windings correspond to the
most advanced angles or projections of the
mountains. It is astonishing that such an ob∣vious
fact should have remained so long unno∣ticed;
for, it is apparent, that, in vallies lined
<PB N="242" REF="277"/>
with opposite mountains, when the declivity of
one of the mountains is less rapid than that of
the other, the course of the rivers is not in the
middle, but nearest to the steepest mountain<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Lettres Philosophiques fur la Formation des Sels, p. 181. and 200</NOTE>.</P>
<P>These general observations might be confirm∣ed
by a multitude of facts. The moutains of
Switzerland, for example, are steeper on the
south side than on the north, and on the west
side than on the east. This appearance is ob∣vious
in Mount Gemmi, Mount Brisa, and in
almost all the other mountains in this country,
the highest of which are those which separate
Vallesia, and the Grisons of Savoy, from Pied∣mont
and Tirol. These countries are, indeed,
only a continuation of the same mountains, the
chain of which extends to the Mediterranean;
and the Pyrennees are only a continuation of
that vast mountain, which commences in Upper
Vallesia, whose branches stretch far to the west
and south, and preserve, throughout that whole
extent, a great height; but, on the north and
east sides, they gradually sink into plains, as ap∣pears
in those great countries which are traver∣sed
by the Rhine and Danube before they finish
their course, while the Rhone descends with ra∣pidity
to the south, and empties itself in the
Mediterranean. The same observation is exem∣plified
in the mountains of England and of
Norway. But the most perfect example is af∣forded
<PB N="243" REF="278"/>
by the mountains of Chili and Peru.
The Cordeliers are exceedingly steep on the
west side; but they have a gradual declivity to
the east, and terminate in vast plains, that are
watered by the greatest rivers in the world<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Phil. Trans. Abridg. vol. 6. part 6. p. 158.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>M. Bourguet, to whom we are indebted for
the discovery of the correspondence between
the angles of mountains, calls this discovery <HI>the
Key to the Theory of the Earth.</HI> However, he
appears not to have perceived its whole impor∣tance;
for, in his treatise on this subject, he
gives only the skeleton of an hypothetical system,
in which most of his conclusions are either false
or uncertain. The theory that we have deliver∣ed
rests upon four principal facts, the truth of
which, after examining the proofs that support
them, cannot admit of a doubt: The <HI>first</HI> is,
That the earth, to very considerable depths, is
every where composed of parallel strata of dif∣ferent
matters, which were formerly in a fluid
or soft state: The <HI>second,</HI> That the sea has, for
many ages, covered the whole earth which we
now inhabit: The <HI>third,</HI> That the tides, and
other motions of the waters, produce inequali∣ties
in the bottom of the sea: And the <HI>fourth,</HI>
That the figure, and corresponding direction of
mountains, have originated from currents in the
ocean.</P>
<P>After perusing the proofs contained in the
subsequent articles, the reader will be enabled to
<PB N="244" REF="279"/>
determine whether I am right in maintaining,
that these facts, when firmly established, will
likewise ascertain the genuine theory of the
earth. What has been remarked concerning the
formation of mountains needs no farther expli∣cation.
But, as it may be objected, that I have
not accounted for the formation of peaks, or
pointed mountains, nor for some other particu∣lar
facts, I shall add such observations as have
occurred upon this subject.</P>
<P>I have endeavoured to form a distinct and
general idea of the manner in which the mate∣rials
composing this earth are arranged, and
have reduced the whole to two classes. The
<HI>first</HI> includes all the matters that are disposed in
horizontal, or regularly inclined beds or strata;
and the <HI>second</HI> comprehends all those matters
which appear in detached masses, in ridges, or
in veins, either perpendicular, or irregularly in∣clined.
In the <HI>first</HI> class I rank sands, clays,
granites, flints, and free-stones in large masses,
pit-coal, slates, and likewise marles, chalk, cal∣cinable
stones, marbles, &amp;c. In the <HI>second,</HI> I in∣clude
metals, minerals, crystals, precious stones,
and flints in detached and small masses. Under
these two classes, all the known materials of the
earth are comprehended. Those of the first
class owe their origin to sediments transported
and deposited by the waters of the sea, and ought
to be distinguished into those that are calcinable
by the application of fire, and those that melt,
<PB N="245" REF="280"/>
and are convertible into glass. The matters
comprehended under the second class are all
vitrifiable, with the exception of those called in∣flammable,
or which totally consume in the fire.</P>
<P>There are, in the first class, two distinct spe∣cies
of sand; the one, which abounds more
than any other matter in the globe, is vitrifiable,
or rather consists of fragments of real glass:
The other, which is less in quantity, is calci∣nable,
and ought to be regarded as the dust of
stone, and as differing from gravel only by the
grossness of its grains. In general, vitrifiable
sand lies in beds; but they are frequently inter∣rupted
by masses of free-stone, of granite, and
of flint; and sometimes these substances appear
in banks of a considerable extent.</P>
<P>Sea-shells are seldom found in vitrifiable bo∣dies;
and even those which appear in them are
not disposed in beds, but scattered, as it were,
by chance: I never, for example, found any in
free-stone. This stone, which abounds in cer∣tain
places, is nothing but sand united by a ce∣ment.
It never appears but in countries where
vitrifiable sand is frequent; and the quarries of
it are generally in pointed hills, in sandy lands,
or in interrupted eminences. These quarries
may be wrought on all sides; and, when they
appear in large beds, they are more distant from
each other than those of marble or calcinable
stones. Blocks of free-stone may be cut of all
dimensions; and, though it be difficult to work,
<PB N="246" REF="281"/>
its hardness is inconsiderable; for it is easily re∣duced
to sand by friction, excepting the black
points or nails sometimes found in it, which are
so hard as to resist the best files. Common rock∣stone,
which I consider as a species of granite,
is vitrifiable, and of a similar nature with free∣stone;
it is only harder, and more firmly ce∣mented.
It has likewise several dense points,
which cut the shoes of travellers on mountai∣nous
grounds. It also contains a great number
of talky spangles; and the whole is so hard as
not to be worked without great labour.</P>
<P>After narrowly examining these hard points
found in free-stone and granite, I discovered that
they consist of metallic matter, which has been
melted and calcined by a strong fire, and that
they have a perfect resemblance to certain sub∣stances
thrown out of volcano's, of which I have
seen vast quantities in Italy. They are called
by the inhabitants <HI>Schiarri.</HI> They are black
heavy masses, upon which neither fire, water,
nor the file, can make any impression. It is
very different from lava, the latter being a spe∣cies
of glass; but the former seems to partake
more of metal than of glass. The points in free∣stone
and granite have a great resemblance to
this matter, whcih is a farther proof that those
substances have formerly been liquified by fire.</P>
<P>On the tops of some high mountains, blocks
of granite appear in great quantities. Their
positions are so irregular, that they seem to have
<PB N="247" REF="282"/>
been thrown together by accident; and we
would be apt to imagine that they had tumbled
down from some neighbouring height, if the
places where they are found were not higher
than any neighbouring ground. But their vi∣trifiable
nature, and their angular and square
figures, like those of free-stone rocks, discover
these substances to have an uncommon origin.
Thus, in large strata of vitrifiable sand, we find
blocks of free-stone and granite, the figure and
situation of which follow not exactly the hori∣zontal
position of strata. The rains have gra∣dually
brought down from the hills and moun∣tains
the sand with which these blocks were ori∣ginally
covered, by furrowing and cutting into
those intervals that appear between the yokes or
nuclei in free-stone, in the same manner as the
hills of Fountainbleau are intersected. Every
point of a hill resembles a nucleus in free-stone
quarries, and all the intervals have been scooped
out by the rains, and the sand they originally
contained has been carried down to the vallies.
In the same manner, the angular blocks of gra∣nite
on the tops of high mountains were for∣merly
covered and surrounded with vitrifiable
sand, which being gradually carried off by the
rains, left the blocks in the position in which
they happened to be formed. These blocks are
generally pointed at the top, and augment in
thickness towards their bases; one block often
rests upon another, that upon a third, and so on,
<PB N="248" REF="283"/>
leaving irregular intervals between them: And
as, in the course of time, the sand which cover∣ed
the blocks, and filled the intervals, was wash∣ed
down by the rains, there would nothing re∣main
on the tops of high mountains but pointed
piles of irregular blocks; and hence the origin
of peaks, or mountains ending in sharp points.</P>
<P>For, let it be supposed, as may easily be pro∣ved
by the sea-bodies found in the Alps, that
this chain of mountains was formerly covered
by the ocean, and that a thick bed of vitrifiable
sand was deposited upon their tops, which redu∣ced
the whole chain to a level country. This
bed of sand would necessary give rise to large
blocks of granite, of free-stone, of flint, and of
other bodies, whose consistence and figure origi∣nate
from sand, nearly in the same manner as
salts crystallize. These blocks, after the sand
which covered them, and filled their interstices,
was carried down to the plains by rains, torrents,
&amp;c. would maintain their original stations, re∣main
bare on the tops of the mountains, and
constitute all those peaks or pointed eminences
so frequently to be met with. To the same
origin must be ascribed those high detached rocks
which are found in China and other countries,
as in Ireland, where they are distinguished by
the name of <HI>Devil's stones,</HI> and the formation of
which, as well as of peaked mountains, has hi∣therto
appeared so difficult to explain. The
explication, however, which I have given, is so
<PB N="249" REF="284"/>
natural, that it generally occurs to every person
who examines these objects; and, on this occa∣sion,
I will set down a passage from father Tar∣tre.
'From Yanchuin-yen we arrived at Ho∣tcheou;
upon the road we remarked a sin∣gular
phaenomenon, namely, rocks of a sur∣prising
height, resembling square towers, in the
midst of vast plains. I cannot account for this
appearance, unless I be allowed to suppose these
rocks to have formerly constituted a part of
mountains, and that the earth, sand, and other
loose parts, had been gradually washed away
by the rains, and left the rocks bare on all sides.
What fortifies this conjecture is, that we saw
some of them, the bases of which were still
surrounded with earth to a considerable
heighth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See letters edifiantes, tome 1. p. 135.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>The tops of the highest mountains, often for
200 or 300 fathoms, consist of rocks of granite,
free-stone, and other hard and vitrifiable sub∣stances:
Below this, we frequently meet with
quarries of marble, or hard calcinable stone, full
of fossil shells; as may be seen at the great
Chartreuse in Dauphiny, and upon Mount Cenis;
where the stones and marbles that contain shells
are situated some hundreds of fathoms below the
points or peaks of high mountains, though these
beds of stone and marble be more than 1000
fathoms above the level of the sea. Thus those
mountains that have peaks or points, generally
<PB N="250" REF="285"/>
consist of vitrifiable rocks; and those, the sum∣mits
of which are flat, contain, for the most part,
marbles, and hard stones full of sea-bodies. The
same remark holds with regard to hills; for
those composed of granite or free-stone, are ge∣nerally
intersected with points, eminences, ca∣vities,
and small vallies. But those composed
of calcinable stone, are nearly of an equal height,
and are only interrupted by larger and more re∣gular
vallies, with corresponding angles; and
they are crowned with rocks, uniform and level
in their position.</P>
<P>Though these two species of mountains seem
to be very different, their figures have been pro∣duced
by the same cause, as has already been
shown: Only, it may be remarked, that the cal∣cinable
stones have suffered no change since the
original formation of the horizontal strata. But
the vitrifiable sands may have been changed and
interrupted by the subsequent production of
rocks and angular blocks that takes place in sand∣beds.
Both species have fissures; those in cal∣cinable
rocks are almost always perpendicular;
but those of granite and free-stone are somewhat
more irregular in their direction. It is in these
fissures that metals, minerals, crystals, sulphur,
and all the substances of our second class, are
found. Below the fissures, the waters assemble,
penetrate the earth, and give rise to the veins of
water that every where appear under the sur∣face.</P>

<HEAD>PROOFS
OF THE
THEORY OF THE EARTH.</HEAD>
<HEAD>ARTICLE X.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of Rivers.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE already remarked, that, in general,
the greatest mountains occupy the middle of
continents; that those of a smaller kind divide
islands, peninsula's, and promontories; that, in
the Old Continent, the direction of the greatest
chains of mountains is from west to east; and
that those which run to the north or south, are
only branches of the principal chains. It will
appear, on examination, that the greatest rivers
have the same direction, and few of them follow
the course of the branches of mountains. To
be convinced of this fact, we have only to run
our eye over a common globe; and, beginning
with Spain, we shall find that the Vigo, the
<PB N="252" REF="287"/>
Douro, the Tagus, and the Guadiana, run from
east to west, and the Ebro from west to east; and
that there is not a river of any consideration
which runs from south to north, or from north
to south, although Spain be almost entirely en∣vironed
by the sea on the northern and southern
parts. This remark concerning the rivers of
Spain demonstrates, that the direction of the
mountains is from west to east; that the sou∣thern
provinces near the Straits are more ele∣vated
than the coasts of Portugal; that, in the
northern parts, the mountains of Galicia, the
Asturias, &amp;c. are only a continuation of the
Pyrennees; and that this elevation of the coun∣try,
both in the south and north, is the cause
which prevents the rivers from running to the
sea in these directions.</P>
<P>In examining the map of France, it is appa∣rent,
that the Rhone is the only river which
runs from north to south; and even near one
half of its course, from the mountains to Lyons,
is from east to west: But the direction of all the
great rivers, as the Loire, the Charente, the Ga∣ronne,
and even the Seine, is from east to west.</P>
<P>The same observation holds with regard to
Germany. The Rhine, like the Rhone, has the
greatest part of its course from south to north:
But the other large rivers, as the Danube, the
Drave, and all the rivers which fall into them,
run from west to east, and empty themselves in
the Black Sea.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="288"/>
The Black Sea, which should rather be re∣garded
as a large lake, is, from east to west, near∣ly
three times as long as from south to north;
and consequently its direction is similar to that
of the rivers. The same remark is applicable
to the Mediterranean, which is nearly six times
longer from east to west than from north to
south.</P>
<P>The Caspian, it must be acknowledged, ac∣cording
to the chart made by order of the Czar
Peter I. extends more from north to south, than
from east to west. But the antient charts re∣presented
it as nearly round, or rather as ex∣tending
more from east to west than in the
opposite direction. If, however, the lake Aral
be considered as a part of the Caspian, from
which it is separated only by a sandy plain, the
greatest extent of this sea will still be from west
to east.</P>
<P>The course of the Euphrates, of the Persic
gulf, and of almost all the rivers of China, is
likewise from west to east. The rivers of the
interior parts of Africa observe the same direc∣tion,
running either from west to east, or from
east to west. The Nile, and the rivers of Bar∣bary,
are the only ones that run from south to
north. There are, it is true, large rivers in A∣sia,
as the Don, the Wolga, &amp;c. which partly
run from north to south: But they only ob∣serve
this direction in order to fall into the Black
<PB N="254" REF="289"/>
and Caspian seas, which are lakes in the interior
parts of the country.</P>
<P>We may, therefore, lay it down as a fact,
that, in general, the rivers and mediterranean
waters of Europe, Asia, and Africa, run or
stretch more from east to west than from north
to south. This is a natural consequence of the
parallel direction of the different chains of
mountains. Besides, the whole continent of
Europe and of Asia is broader from east to west
than from north to south: For the direction of
mountains may be considered in two points of
view; in a long and narrow continent, like that
of South America, which contains only one
principal chain of mountains, extending from
south to north, the rivers, not being restrained
by any parallel chain, must run in channels per∣pendicular
to the range of these mountains, that
is, either from east to west, or from west to
east; and this, in fact, is the direction of all the
great rivers in America. But though, both in
the Old and New Continent, the great rivers
run in the same direction, this effect is produ∣ced
by different causes. The rivers, in the Old
Continent, run from east to west, because they
are confined by many parallel chains of moun∣tains
that stretch from west to east; but those
of America observe the same direction, because
there is only one cahin of mountains stretching
from south to north.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="290"/>
The rivers generally occupy the middle of
the vallies, or the lowest ground between two
opposite hills: If the two hills have nearly an
equal declivity, the river runs nearly in the mid∣dle
between them, whether the intermediate
valley be broad or narrow. If, on the contra∣ry,
the declivity of one of the hills be greater
than that of the other, the river will not occupy
the middle of the valley, but will approach to
the steepest hill, in proportion to the superiority
of its declivity. In this case, the middle of the
valley is not the lowest ground between the two
hills, but lies much nearer the steepest of them;
and consequently the river must occupy this
space. This observation holds universally where∣ever
the difference in declivity is any ways re∣markable;
and the rivers never recede from the
steepest hills, unless, in their course, they meet
with other hills of equal declivity. In process
of time, however, the declivity of the steepest
hill is diminished by the rains, the melting of
snow, &amp;c. The steeper any hill is, it loses great∣er
quantities of earth, sand, and gravel, by the
operation of rains, and these substances are car∣ried
down into the plain with a proportionably
greater rapidity, and, of course, force the ri∣ver
to change its channel, or, in other words, to
retire into a lower part of the valley. To this
it may be added, that, as all rivers occasionally
swell, and overflow their banks, they carry off
mud and sand, which they deposite in different
<PB N="256" REF="291"/>
parts of the valley; and, as sand and gravel are
often accumulated in the channels themselves,
these circumstances make the waters overflow
and alter the direction of their course. Nothing,
accordingly, is more common, than to find in
vallies many old channels in which the river has
formerly run, especially when it is rapid, sub∣ject
to frequent inundations, and carries down
great quantities of sand and mud.</P>
<P>In plains, and extensive valleys, watered by
large rivers, the channels of the rivers are com∣monly
the lowest parts: But the surface of the
water in the river is sometimes higher than the
adjacent ground. When a river, for instance,
begins to overflow, it soon covers a considerable
part of the plain; but the banks remain longest
uncovered by the water. This plainly demon∣strates
the banks to be higher than the neigh∣bouring
ground; and from the banks, to a cer∣tain
part of the plain, there is a small declivity
or slope. When, therefore, the water rises to
the margin of the banks, it must be higher than
the plain. This elevation of the ground on the
banks of rivers is occasioned by mud and
sand being deposited in the time of inundations.
The water, during great swells, is always ex∣ceedingly
foul and muddy: When it begins to
overflow, it runs slowly over the banks, and, by
depositing the mud and sand, it gradually puri∣fies
as it advances into the plain: Thus, all the
mud, and other substances, that are not carried
<PB N="257" REF="292"/>
down by the current, are deposited upon the
banks, and gradually elevate them above the
rest of the plain.</P>
<P>Rivers are always widest at their mouths, and
turn gradually narrower towards their sources:
But it is more worthy of remark, that, in the in∣terior
parts of a country, and at great distances
from the sea, their course is straight, and the
frequency of their windings increases propor∣tionably
as they approach to their termination.
I have been informed by M. Fabry, who per∣formed
many journeys in the western parts of
North America, that travellers, and even the sa∣vages,
form pretty accurate computations of
their distance from the sea, by observing the
courses of the rivers. If a river ran straight for
15 or 20 leagues, they knew themselves to be a
great way from the coast; but, if the sinuosities
were frequent, they concluded that the sea was
not very distant. M. Fabry, when travelling
through unknown and uninhabited regions, de∣rived
much advantage from this observation.
Near the sides of great rivers, the regorging of
the water is likewise less apparent the farther
from the sea, which furnishes another medium
of judging concerning the distance: And, as the
sinuosities multiply the nearer rivers approach
to their mouths, it is not surprising that some of
them should yield to the pressure of the water,
and give rise to several branches, or divisions,
before they reach the sea.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="293"/>
The motion of the water in rivers is very dif∣ferent
from the representation given of it by
mathematicians. The surface, taken from bank
to bank, is not level; but the middle of the
stream is either higher or lower, according to
circumstances, than the water at the sides. When
a river swells suddenly by the melting of snow,
or any other cause, its rapidity increases; and, if
its course be straight, the middle of the stream,
where the current is greatest, rises and forms a
sensible convexity. This elevation is sometimes
very considerable. M. Hupeau, who measured
this difference of level between the sides and
the stream of the Aveiron, found it to be three
feet. This effect must always be produced
when the rapidity of the current is great; for
the quickness of the motion, by diminishing, or
partly preventing the action of gravity, allows
not to the water, in the middle of the stream,
time sufficient to bring it to a level with that on
the sides, and, therefore, it remains higher. On
the other hand, near the mouths, though the
current be very rapid, the water near the sides
is commonly more elevated than that of the
middle: The river, in this situation, has a con∣cave
form, the lowest point of which is the
middle of the stream. This always happens as
far as the influence of the tides is perceptible,
which, in large rivers, extends sometimes to 100
or 200 leagues from the sea. It is likewise a
fact well known, that the streams of rivers con∣tinue
<PB N="259" REF="294"/>
their motion a considerable way through
the waters of the sea. In this case, the water of
the river has two opposite motions. The middle,
or current, precipitates itself towards the sea;
but the action of the tide produces a counter
current, or regorging, which elevates the water
on the sides, while that in the middle descends;
and, as all the water must be carried down by
the current, that on the sides constantly descends
towards the middle of the stream, with a quick∣ness
proportioned to the elevation it receives
from the regorging of the tide.</P>
<P>There are two species of regorging, or dam∣ming
up, in rivers: The first is that just now
described, and is occasioned by the action of the
ride, which not only opposes the natural descent
of the water, but even communicates to it a
contrary motion or current: The other is pro∣duced
by an inactive cause, as a projection of
the land, an island, &amp;c. Though this kind of
regorging gives not rise to any extraordinary
counter current, it often sensibly retards the pro∣gress
of small boats, and produces what is called
<HI>dead water,</HI> which observes not the natural course
of the river, but turns about in such a manner
as greatly obstructs the progress of vessels. These
dead waters are sensibly felt in passing through
the arches of a bridge, especially if the river be
rapid. The celerity with which water runs,
when the height or pressure is the same, increases
in proportion as the diameter of the canal,
<PB N="260" REF="295"/>
through which it passes, is diminished. The ce∣lerity
of a river, therefore, in passing through a
bridge, increases in the inverse proportion of the
width of the whole arches, to the total width of
the river. This increase of celerity, in passing
through the arch of a bridge, is so considerable,
that it pushes the water from the stream towards
the banks, from which it is reflected, and some∣times
forms violent eddies or whirlpools. In
passing under the bridge of St Esprit, the mari∣ners
are obliged scrupulously to keep the stream,
even after leaving the bridge; for, if they al∣lowed
the boat to decline either to the right or
left, it would be driven with violence against
the banks, or, at least, would be forced into the
whirling or dead waters, from which they would
find some difficulty of escaping. When the
eddy is considerable, it forms a small gulf with
a cylindrical void in the middle of it, round
which the water turns with rapidity. This cy∣lindrical
cavity is an effect of the centrifugal
force, which makes the water endeavour to fly
off from the center of the whirlpool.</P>
<P>When a great swell of the river is about to
happen, the water-men perceive a particular
motion, which they call a <HI>moving at the bottom</HI>;
that is, when the water at the bottom moves with
an unusual velocity, which, according to them,
always indicates the approach of a sudden swell.
The motion and weight of the superior waters,
though not yet arrived, fail not to act upon the
<PB N="261" REF="296"/>
waters in the inferior parts of the river, and to
communicate motion to them: For a river, in
some respects, must be considered as a column
of water contained in a tube, and its channel as a
long canal, in which every motion must be com∣municated
from one end of it to the other. Now,
independent of the motion of the superior wa∣ters,
their weight alone may increase the celeri∣ty
of the river, and perhaps make it move quick∣est
at the bottom; for, it is well known, that,
when several boats are all at once pushed into a
river, they increase the motion of the water be∣low,
and retard that of the superior water.</P>
<P>The celerity of running waters is not in ex∣act
proportion to the declivity of their channels.
A river with a uniform declivity, and double to
that of another, ought not, it would appear, to
run with more than a double celerity: But its
celerity is much more quick, being sometimes
triple, sometimes quadruple, &amp;c. The celerity
depeends more upon the quantity of water, and
the weight of the superior waters, than upon
the degree of descent. In digging the bed of a
river or drain, it is unnecessary to make the de∣scent
uniform through its whole extent. A
quick motion is more easily produced by ma∣king
the declivity much greater at the source
then at the mouth, where, like the beds of na∣tural
rivers, it is almost imperceptible, and yet
they preserve their celerity, which is more or
less, according to the quantity they contain; for,
<PB N="262" REF="297"/>
in great rivers, even where the ground is level,
the water still runs, not only with the velocity
originally acquired, but with the accumulated
velocity produced by the action and weight of
the superior waters<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By not attending to these circumstances, M. Khun was led falsely to affirm, that the source of the Danube was at least two German miles higher than its mouth; that the Mediterranean is 6¾ German miles lower than the sources of the Nile; that the Atlantic ocean is half a mile lower than the Mediterranean, &amp;c.</NOTE>. To make this matter still
more plain, let us suppose the Seine from Pont∣neuf
to Pont-royal to be perfectly level, and to
be ten feet deep; let us also suppose the bed of
the river below Pont-royal and above Pont-neuf,
to be suddenly dried up; the waters, in this case,
would run both up and down the channel, till
their equilibrium was perfectly restored. This
effect is produced entirely by the weight of the
water, which never allows it to remain at rest
till its particles are equally pressed on all sides,
and its surface reduced to a perfect level. The
weight of water, therefore, contributes greatly
to increase the celerity of its motion. This is
the reason why the greatest celerity in a current
of water is neither at the bottom nor at the sur∣face,
but nearly in the middle, which is pressed
both by the column above, and by the reaction
from the bottom. But, what is still more, when
a river acquires a great celerity, it will not only
preserve it, though running through a level
country, but even surmount heights, without
<PB N="263" REF="298"/>
spreading much to a side, or, at least, without
producing an inundation of any moment.</P>
<P>One would be apt to imagine, that bridges,
and other obstacles erected in rivers, would create
a considerable diminution of celerity in their
whole course. But the difference is very small.
The water, upon meeting with any obstacle, rises,
in order to surmount it; and the increase of ce∣lerity
communicated by its fall, nearly compen∣sates
the retardation occasioned by the obstacle.
Thus, sinuosities, projections from the land, and
islands, create but a small variation on the total
celerity of a river's course. The most conside∣rable
alterations are produced by the greater or
lesser quantities of water; when the quantity is
small, a river runs slow, when great, it runs with
rapidity.</P>
<P>If rivers were always equally full, to enlarge
their channels would be the best method of di∣minishing
their rapidity, and to contain them
within their banks. But, as almost all rivers
rise and fall, it is more necessary, for this latter
purpose, to narrow their channels; for small
waters, with large channels, generally scoop
out winding beds in the middle; and, when they
swell, they follow the direction of these particu∣lar
beds, and, by striking with violence against
the banks, often do much injury to mills and
other works. These bad effects might be pre∣vented,
by digging gulfs in the earth at conve∣nient
distances. To accomplish this, a part of
<PB N="264" REF="299"/>
one of the banks should be cut through, and the
earth removed for a considerable space. These
small gulfs should be made in the obtuse angles
of the river; for the water, in turning, would
run into them; and, of course, its celerity would
be diminished. This method might be useful in
preventing the fall of bridges in places where
sufficient barriers cannot be erected to resist the
weight of the water.</P>
<P>The manner in which inundations are pro∣duced,
merits particular attention. When a ri∣ver
swells, its celerity uniformly increases, till
it begins to overflow the banks: From that mo∣ment
its rapidity is checked, which is the reason
why inundations always continue several days;
for, though the quantity of water should be
diminished after the commencement of the in∣undation,
it would, notwithstanding, continue
to overflow; because this circumstance depends
more on the celerity than on the quantity of
water. If it were otherwise, rivers would often
overflow their banks for an hour or two, and
then retire to their channels, which never does
happen. An inundation, on the contrary, al∣ways
lasts some days, supposing the rains have
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and less water runs in the river; because
the overflowing of waters diminishes their ecle∣rity;
and, consequently, although the same
quantity of water arrives not in the same time
as formerly, the effect is the same as if a larger
quantity had been brought down. It may like∣wise
<PB N="265" REF="300"/>
here be remarked, that, if a high wind
blows contrary to the current of the river, the
inundation will be increased by this occasional
cause, which diminishes the celerity of the wa∣ter;
but, if the wind blows in the direction of
the current, the inundation will be less, and re∣tire
more quickly.</P>
<P>'The inundation of the Nile,' says M. Gran∣ger,
'has long been a subject of discussion a∣mong
the learned. Most of them have consi∣dered
it as a singular and wonderful phaenome∣non,
though nothing be more natural or more
common; for it takes place in every country,
as well as in Egypt. The inundation of the
Nile is occasioned by the rains which fall in
Aethiopia and Abyssinia; but the north wind
may be regarded as the principal cause of it:
1. Because the north wind drives the clouds
that contain this rain into Abyssinia: 2. Be∣cause
it prevents the water from running out
of the mouths of the river in any great quan∣tity,
by damming up the stream. The great
effect of this wind may be remarked every
season; for, when it changes from north, the
Nile loses more water in one day than in four.'</P>
<P>Inundations are generally greatest in the su∣perior
parts of rivers; because, as formerly ob∣served,
the velocity of a river uniformly in∣creases
till it empties itself in the ocean. Father
Costelli, a sensible writer on this subject, re∣marks,
that the banks, raised for the purpose of
<PB N="266" REF="301"/>
keeping the Po from overflowing, gradually di∣minish
in height, as the river approaches to the
sea; that, at Ferrara, which is 60 or 70 miles
from the mouth of the river, the banks are a∣bout
20 feet above the ordinary level of the
water; but that, at 10 or 12 miles from the
sea, though the channel be equally narrow as
at Ferrara, they are not above 12 feet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Racolta d'autori che trattano del moto dell' acque, vel. 1. p. 123.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In fine, the theory of running waters is sub∣ject
to many difficulties. It is not easy to give
general rules that will apply to every particular
case. For this purpose, experience is preferable
to speculation: It is not enough that we know
the common effects of rivers in general; but, if
we would reason justly, and give stability to
our operations, we ought to study the peculiari∣ties
of particular rivers in which we have an
interest. Though the remarks I have made be
generally new, a greater collection is necessary;
and perhaps we shall in time acquire a distinct
knowledge of this subject, and be enabled to
give certain rules for directing and confining
rivers in such a manner as will prevent the de∣struction
of bridges, banks, and other damages
occasioned by the impetuosity of the waters.</P>

<P>In order to compute the quantity of water
discharged into the sea by all the rivers, we shall
suppose, which is nearly the truth, that one half
of the earth's surface is sea, and the other half
dry land: We shall likewise suppose the mean
depth of the sea to be about 230 fathoms. The
total surface of the earth is 170981012 square
miles, and that of the sea is 85490506 square
miles, which being multiplied by 1-fourth,
the depth of the sea, gives 21372626 cubic
miles for the quantity of water contained
in the whole ocean. Now, to compute the
quantity discharged into the ocean by the
rivers, let us take a river, the velocity and
quantity of whose waters are known; the Po,
for example, which passes through Lombardy,
and waters a country of 380 miles in length.
According to Riccioli, the breadth of the Po, be∣fore
it divides into branches, is 100 perches of
Boulogne, or 1000 feet; and its depth is 10
feet; and it runs at the rate of 4 miles in an
<PB N="270" REF="305"/>
hour: Consequently, the Po discharges into the
sea 200,000 cubical perches of water in an hour,
or 4,800,000 in a day. But a cubic mile con∣tains
125,000,000 cubic perches; of course, it
will require 26 days to discharge into the sea a
cubic mile of water. It only remains to deter∣mine
the proportion that the Po bears to all the
rivers of the earth taken together, which cannot
be done exactly. But, to approach nearly to the
truth, let us suppose that the quantity of water
which the sea receives from the great rivers in
every country, is proportioned to the extent of
the surfaces of these countries; and, consequent∣ly,
that the country watered by the Po, and by
the rivers which fall into it, is to the total sur∣face
of the dry land as the Po is to all the rivers
of the earth. Now, by the most exact charts,
it appears, that the Po, from its origin to its
mouth, traverses a country of 380 miles in
length; and the rivers which fall into it on each
side arise from sources which are about 60 miles
distant from the Po. Thus, the Po, and the ri∣vers
it receives, water a country 380 miles long,
and 120 broad, which makes 45600 square
miles. But the surface of the dry land is
85490506 square miles; consequently, the quan∣tity
of water carried to the sea by all the rivers
will be 1874 times greater than the quantity
discharged by the Po. But, as 26 rivers, equal
to the Po, furnish a cubic mile of water each
day, it follows, that, in the space of a year,
<PB N="271" REF="306"/>
1874 rivers equal to the Po, will carry to the
sea 26308 cubic miles of water; and that, in
812 years, all these rivers would discharge
21372626 cubic miles, which is a quantity equal
to what is contained in the ocean; of course, if
the ocean were empty, 812 years would be ne∣cessary
to fill it by the rivers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See keil's examination of Burnet's theory, p. 126.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is a result of this calculation, that the quan∣tity
of water raised from the sea by evapora∣tion,
and transported upon land by the winds,
is from 20 to 21 inches in the year, or about ⅔
of a French line each day. This evaporation,
though tripled to make allowance for what falls
back into the sea from the clouds, is very incon∣siderable.
Mr Halley<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Phil. Trans. num. 192.</NOTE> has clearly demonstrated,
that the vapours transported from the sea, and
discharged upon the land, are sufficient to main∣tain
all the rivers and lakes in the world.</P>
<P>After the Nile, the Jordan is the largest river
in the Levant, or even in Barbary. It discharges
each day into the Dead Sea about 6,000,000 of
tons. All this water, and more, is carried off
by evaporation; for, according to Halley's cal∣culation
of 6914 tons evaporated from each su∣perficial
mile, the Dead Sea, which is 72 miles
long and 18 broad, must lose, every day, by
evaporation, near 9,000,000 of tons; that is,
not only all the water it receives from the Jor∣dan,
but from the smaller rivers which come
<PB N="272" REF="307"/>
from the mountains of Moab, and elsewhere.
Of course, this sea has no occasion to communi∣cate
with any other by subterraneous passages<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Shaw's travels.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The most rapid of all rivers are, the Tigris,
the Indus, the Danube, the Yrtis in Siberia, the
Malmistra in Cilicia, &amp;c.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Varenii Geog. p. 178.</NOTE> But, as was for∣merly
remarked, the velocity of rivers depends
both on the declivity and the weight of water.
In examining the globe, we find, that the Da∣nube
has less declivity than the Po, the Rhine,
or the Rhone; for, the course of the Danube is
longer, and it falls into the Black Sea, which is
higher than the Mediterranean, and perhaps
than the ocean.</P>
<P>Great rivers, in their course, are constantly
receiving small ones into their channels. The
Danube, for example, receives more than 200
brooks and rivulets. But, if we reckon only
rivers of some consideration, we will find, that
the Danube receives 30 or 31, the Wolga 32 or
33, the Don 5 or 6, the Nieper 19 or 20, the
Duine 11 or 12. The Hoanho, in Asia, receives
34 or 35 rivers, the Jenisca more than 60, the
Oby an equal number, the Amour about 40, the
Kian, or river of Nankin, 30, the Ganges more
than 20, the Euphrates 10 or 11, &amp;c. In Afri∣ca,
the Senegal receives more than 20 rivers;
the Nile receives none lower than 500 leagues
from its mouth, the last which falls into it be∣ing
the Moraba; and from this place to its
<PB N="273" REF="308"/>
source, it receives about 12 or 13. In America,
the Amazones receives more than 60 conside∣rable
rivers, St Laurence about 40, reckoning
those which fall into the lakes, the Missisippi
more than 40, the Plata above 50, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Upon the surface of the earth, there are ele∣vated
countries which seem to be points of par∣tition
marked out by nature for the distribution
of the waters. In Europe, one of these points
is Mont Saint-Godard, and its environs. A∣nother
point is the country situated between the
provinces of Belozera and Wologda in Muscovy,
from which many rivers descend, some into the
White Sea, some into the Black, and others into
the Caspian. In Asia there are several points of
partition, as the country of the Mogul Tartars,
some of whose rivers run into the sea of Nova
Zembla, others into the gulf of Linchidolin,
others into the sea of Corea, and others into that
of China; and the Lesser Thibet, the rivers of
which run into the Chinese sea, into the gulf of
Bengal, the gulf of Cambaia, and the lake Aral.
The province of Quito, in America, discharges
its rivers into the south and north seas, and into
the gulf of Mexico.</P>
<P>There are, in the Old Continent, about 430
rivers which directly fall either into the Ocean,
or into the Mediterranean and Black Seas. But,
in the New Continent, we know of only 145
rivers that fall immediately into the sea. In this
<PB N="274" REF="309"/>
number I have reckoned none that are not as
large as the river Somme in Picardy.</P>
<P>All these rivers transport, from the countries
through which they pass, into the sea, great
quantities of mineral and saline particles. The
particles of salt, which dissolve in water, are easily
carried down to the sea. Several philosophers, and
particularly Halley, have alledged, that the salt∣ness
of the sea proceeds alone from the particles
of salt transported by the rivers: Others main∣tain,
that this saltness was coeval with the sea
itself, and that the salt was created to prevent
the waters from corrupting. But the agitation
of the sea by the winds and the tides is, I ima∣gine,
a cause equally powerful as the salt in pre∣serving
it against putrifaction; for, when bar∣relled
up, it corrupts in a few days. And Boyle
informs us of a navigator who was overtaken
with a calm which lasted 13 days, and who as∣sured
him, that the water became so putrid, that,
if the calm had continued much longer, the
whole crew would have perished<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Boyle, vol. 3. p. 222.</NOTE>. Sea-water is
also impregnated with a bituminous oil, which
renders it both unwholesome, and disagreeable
to the taste. The quantity of salt in sea-water
is about a fortieth part, and it is nearly of an
equal saltness at the surface and at the bottom,
under the Line and at the Cape of Good Hope;
though there are some particular places, as off
the Mosambique coast, where it is more salt than
<PB N="275" REF="310"/>
in others<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Boyle, vol. 3. p 217.</NOTE>. It is likewise said to be less salt
within the Arctic circle: But this phaenomenon
may proceed from the immense quantities of
snow, and the large rivers which fall into these
seas, and from the proportional defect of evapo∣ration.</P>
<P>However this matter stands, I believe, that
the saltness of the ocean is not only occasioned
by the many banks of salt at the bottom of the
sea, and along the coasts, but likewise by the
salts continually brought down by the rivers;
that Halley was right in his conjecture that
there was originally little or no salt in the sea,
but that its saltness gradually augmented in pro∣portion
as it was supplied by the rivers; that
the degree of saltness is perpetually increasing;
and, consequently, that, by computing the total
quantity of salt carried down by the rivers, we
might be enabled to discover the real age of the
world. Mr Boyle affirms, on the authority of
divers and pearl-fishers, that the water is colder
in proportion to its depth; and that, at great
depths, the cold becomes so excessive as to oblige
them to come up much sooner than usual. But
the weight of the water may be as much the
cause of their uneasiness as the intenseness of the
cold, especially when they descend 300 or 400
fathom. Divers, however, seldom go deeper
than 100 feet. The same author relates, that,
in a voyage to the East Indies, when they ar∣rived
<PB N="276" REF="311"/>
at the 35th degree of south latitude, they
sounded to the depth of 400 fathoms, and when
the lead, which weighed about 30 pounds, was
drawn up, it had become as cold as ice. It is
likewise a common practice at sea, to sink the
bottles several fathoms, in order to cool their
wine; and, it is said, that the deeper the bottles
are sunk, the wine becomes the cooler.</P>
<P>These facts would lead us to imagine, that
the sea-water was salter at the bottom than at
the surface. But they are opposed by facts of a
contrary nature: Experiments have been made
with vessels which opened only at a certain depth,
and the water was not found to be salter than
that at the surface. There are even examples
of the water at the bottom being fresher than at
the surface: This phaenomenon is exhibited in
all those places where springs arise from the bot∣tom
of the sea, as near Goa, at Ormus, and in
the sea of Naples, in which there are many
warm springs.</P>
<P>In other places, sulphurous springs and beds
of bitumen have been discovered at the bottom
of the sea; and, upon land, there are numerous
springs of bitumen that run down into the sea. At
Barbadoes, there is a fountain of bitumen which
runs from the rocks into the sea. Bitumen and
salt, then, are the principal ingredients in sea∣water.
But it is blended with many other sub∣stances;
for its taste differs considerably in dif∣ferent
parts of the ocean: Besides, agitation and
<PB N="277" REF="312"/>
the heat of the sun change the natural taste of
sea-water, and the different colours of different
seas, and even of the same sea at different times,
prove it to be mixed with many heterogeneous
bodies, which are detached either from the bot∣tom,
or carried down by the rivers.</P>
<P>Most countries that are furnished with large
rivers are subject to periodical inundations; and
those rivers which have long courses overflow
with the greatest regularity. Every body has
heard of the inundations of the Nile, the waters
of which, though spread over a large track of
country, and at a great distance from the sea,
preserve their sweetness and transparency. Strabo
and other antient authors tell us, that the Nile
had seven mouths; but now only two that are
navigable remain: A third canal, indeed, sup∣plies
the cisterns of Alexandria; and there is a
fourth which is still less considerable. As the
cleaning of their canals has long been neglected,
they are mostly in ruins. In these works the
antients annually employed a vast number of
workmen and soldiers, who carried off the mud
and sand which this river brings down in great
quantities. The overflowing of the Nile is oc∣casioned
by the rains that fall in Aethiopia: They
begin in April, and end not till September. Du∣ring
the first three months, the days are serene
and beautiful; but the sun no sooner sets, than
the rains begin, continue incessantly till sun∣rising,
and are commonly accompanied with
<PB N="278" REF="313"/>
thunder and lightning. The inundation in
Egypt begins about the 17th of June; it gene∣rally
takes 40 days in swelling, and as many in
subsiding. The whole flat country of Egypt is
overflowed: But the inundation is not now so
great as in antient times; for Herodotus affirms,
that the Nile swelled 100 days, and required an
equal time to subside. If this fact be true, the
difference can be ascribed to no other cause but
the gradual elevation of the land by the mud
deposited by the waters, and the diminution in
the height of the mountains from which this
river derives its source. It is natural to think,
that the height of the mountains is diminished;
for the heavy rains that fall in these regions du∣ring
one half of the year, bring down great
quantities of sand and earth from the tops of
the mountains into the vallies, from which they
are transported by torrents into the channel of
the Nile, and are partly deposited on the land by
means of the inundations.</P>
<P>The Nile is not the only river that has regu∣lar
and annual overflowings: The Pegu, which
is equally regular in its inundations, has, from
this circumstance, got the name of the <HI>Indian
Nile.</HI> It overflows the country for 30 leagues
beyond its banks, and, like the Nile, leaves great
quantities of mud and slime, which enrich the
ground so much, that it produces excellent pa∣sture
for cattle, and enables the inhabitants to
<PB N="279" REF="314"/>
export rice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Les Voyages d' Ovington, tom. 2. p. 290.</NOTE>. The Niger, or, which is the same
thing, the upper part of the Senegal, overflows
and covers the whole flat country of Nigritia.
Its inundation, like that of the Nile, begins about
the middle of June, and increases for 40 days.
The Plata, in Brasil, overflows annually, and at
the same time with the Nile. The Ganges, the
Indus, the Euphrates, and some other rivers,
produce annual inundations. But all rivers are
not subject to periodic inundations: These pro∣ceed
from a combination of causes, which, at
the same time, augment the quantity of water,
and diminish its velocity.</P>
<P>We formerly remarked, that the declivity of
rivers gradually diminish till they arrive at the
sea. But, in some places, the declivity is more
sudden, and forms what is called <HI>a cataract,</HI>
which is nothing more than an unusually rapid
fall of the water. In the Rhine, for example,
there are two cataracts, one at Bilefeld, and the
other near Schafhouse. The Nile has several
cataracts, two of the most remarkable fall from
a great height, between two mountains. In the
Wologda, in Muscovy, there are also two, near
Ladoga. The Zaire, a river in Congo, com∣mences
with a large cataract which falls from
the top of a mountain. But the most celebra∣ted
cataract is that of the river Niagara in Ca∣nada:
It falls, in a prodigious torrent, 156 feet
of perpendicular height, and is a fourth part of
<PB N="280" REF="315"/>
a league in breadth. The vapour of the water
rises to the clouds, is seen at the distance of five
leagues, and, when the sun shines above it, ex∣hibits
a beautiful rainbow. Below this cataract
the whirlpools and commotions of the waters
are so tremendous, as to render navigation im∣practicable
for six miles; and above it, the ri∣ver
is much narrower than higher up<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Phil. Trans. Abridg. vol. 6. part 2. p. 119.</NOTE>. Char∣levoix<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Tom. 3. p. 353.</NOTE>
describes it in the following manner:</P>
<P>'My first care, after my arrival, was to visit
the noblest cascade, perhaps, in the world; but
I presently found the Baron de la Hontan had
committed such a mistake with respect to its
height and figure, as to give grounds to believe
he had never seen it. It is certain, that, if you
measure its height by that of the three moun∣tains
you are obliged to climb to get at it, it
does not come much short of what the map of
M. Deslisle makes it, that is, 600 feet, having
certainly gone into this paradox, either on the
faith of the Baron de la Hontan, or Father
Hennepin. But after I arrived at the summit
of the third mountain, I observed, that, in the
space of three leagues, which I had to walk
before I came to this piece of water, though
you are sometimes obliged to ascend, you must
yet descend still more, a circumstance to which
travellers seem not to have sufficiently attend∣ed.
As it is impossible to approach it but on
<PB N="281" REF="316"/>
one side only, and consequently to see it, ex∣cepting
in profile, or sideways; it is no easy
matter to measure its height with instruments.
It, has, however, been attempted by means of
a pole tied to a long line, and, after many re∣peated
trials, it has been found only 115, or
120 feet high. But it is impossible to be sure
that the pole has not been stopt by some pro∣jecting
rock; for, though it was always drawn
up wet, as well as the end of the line to which
it was tied, this proves nothing at all, as the
water which precipitates itself from the moun∣tain,
rises very high in foam. For my own
part, after having examined it on all sides,
where it could be viewed to the greatest ad∣vantage,
I am inclined to think we cannot al∣low
it less than a hundred and forty, or fifty
feet.'</P>
<P>'As to its figure, it is in the shape of a horse∣shoe,
and is about 400 paces in circumference;
it is divided into two, exactly in the middle,
by a very narrow island, half a quarter of a
league long. It is true, those two parts very
soon unite; that on my side, and which I could
only have a side view of, has several branches
which project from the body of the cascade,
but that which I viewed in front, appeared to
me quite entire. The Baron de la Hontan
mentions a torrent, which, if this author has
not invented it, must certainly fall through
some channel on the melting of the snows.'</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="317"/>
Three leagues from Albany, in the province
of New York, there is a cataract of 50 feet per∣pendicular
height, the vapour of which gives
rise also to a rainbow<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Phil. Trans. Abridg. vol. 6. part 2. p. 119.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In every country where the number of men
is too inconsiderable for forming and supporting
polished societies, the surface of the earth is more
unequal and rugged, and the channels of rivers
are more extended, irregular, and often in∣terrupted
by cataracts. The Rhone and the
Loire would require the operation of several
ages before they became navigable. It is by
consining and directing the waters, and clearing
the bottoms of rivers, that they acquire a fixed
and determinate course. In thinly inhabited
regions, nature is always rude, and sometimes
deformed.</P>
<P>Some rivers lose themselves in the sands, and
others seem to precipitate into the bowels of the
earth. The Guadalquiver in Spain, the river of
Gottenburg in Sweden, and even the Rhine,
disappear under ground. It is affirmed, that, in
the west part of the island of St Domingo, there
is a pretty high mountain, at the foot of which
are several large caverns, that receive the rivers
and brooks; and the noise of their fall is heard
at the distance of seven or eight leagues<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Varen. Geogr. p. 43.</NOTE>. The
number of rivers, however, that disappear in the
earth, is very small; and they seem not to de∣scend
<PB N="283" REF="318"/>
very deep. It is more probable, that, like
the Rhine, they lose themselves by dividing and
dispersing through a large surface of sand, which
is very common with those small rivers that run
through dry and sandy ground, of which there
are many examples in Africa, Persia, Arabia,
&amp;c.</P>
<P>The rivers of the north carry down to the
sea prodigious quantities of ice, which, by accu∣mulating,
form those enormous masses, so dan∣gerous
to the mariner. The straits of Waigat,
which is frozen during the greatest part of the
year, is most remarkable for these masses of ice,
which are constantly brought into the straits by
the river Oby. They attach themselves all a∣long
the coasts, and rise to great heights. The
middle of the strait freezes last, and the ice, of
course, does not rise so high as on each side.
When the north wind ceases, and it blows in the
direction of the straits, the ice begins to melt and
to break in the middle; then large masses are
detached, and transported into the open sea.
The wind, which blows during the whole win∣ter
from the north, over the frozen country of
Nova Zembla, renders the regions watered by
the Oby, and all Siberia, so cold, that, at Tobol∣ski,
in the 57th degree, there are no fruit trees,
though at Stockholm in Sweden, and even in
higher latitudes, they have fruit trees and legu∣minous
plants. This difference proceeds not,
as has been imagined, from the sea of Lapland
<PB N="284" REF="319"/>
being colder than that of the straits, nor from
the country of Nova Zembla being colder than
that of Lapland, but from this circumstance alone,
that the Baltic and the sea of Bothnia soften the
rigour of the north wind; whereas, in Siberia,
there is nothing to check its activity. This so∣lution
is a result of experience. The cold is
never so intense near the sea coasts as in the in∣terior
parts of a country. There are plants
which endure the open air all winter at London,
which cannot be preserved at Paris: And Sibe∣ria,
which is a vast continent, is, for this reason,
colder than Sweden, which is almost surround∣ed
with the sea.</P>
<P>Spitzbergen is the coldest country in the
world: It runs as far as the 78th degree of north
latitude, and is composed of small, pointed
mountains. These mountains consist of gravel,
and of flat stones, like gray slate, heaped upon
one another. According to the accounts of voy∣agers,
these hills are raised by the winds, and
new ones appear every season. In this country
no quadrupeds live but the rein-deer, which
feeds upon moss. Beyond these hills, and a∣bove
a league from the sea, the mast of a ship
was lately found with a pully fixed to one end
of it; from which circumstance, it has been
concluded, that this is a new country, and that
it was formerly covered with the sea: It is un∣inhabited
and uninhabitable; for the hills have
no consistence, but are loose and moveable; and
<PB N="285" REF="320"/>
a vapour proceeds from the earth, so cold and
penetrating, as to preclude the possibility of re∣maining
any time upon this dreary and inhos∣pitable
land.</P>
<P>The whale-fishing vessels arrive at Spitzber∣gen
in July, and depart from it about the mid∣dle
of August, the ice not permitting them
to arrive sooner, or to remain longer. In these
seas there are prodigious boards of ice, clear and
shining as glass, and from 60 to 80 fathom
thick; and, in some places, the sea appears to
be frozen to the bottom<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See recueil des voyages du Nord, tom. 1. p. 154.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The seas of North America are likewise much
infested with ice, as in Ascension-bay, in Hud∣son's,
Cumberland's, Davis's, and Frobisher's
straits, &amp;c. We are assured by Robert Lade,
that the mountains of Friesland are entirely co∣vered
with snow; and that the ice surrounds the
coasts, and, like a bulwark, prevents all approach
to them. 'It is remarkable,' says he, 'that, in
this sea, we meet with islands of ice, more than
half a league in circumference, exceedingly
high, and that descend from 70 to 80 fathoms
deep. This ice, which is sweet, is perhaps o∣riginally
formed in the rivers or straits of the
adjacent lands, &amp;c. These islands or moun∣tains
of ice are moveable, and , in storms, they
follow the tract of a ship, as if they were
drawn after her by a rope. Some of them
<PB N="286" REF="321"/>
rise so high above water, that they surmount
the tops of the tallest masts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Lade's voyages.</NOTE>,' &amp;c.</P>
<P>In the voyages collected for the use of the
Dutch East India Company, we have the fol∣lowing
account of the ice off Nova Zembla:
'At Cape Troost, the weather was so foggy, as
to oblige us to moor our vessel to a bank of
ice, which was 36 fathoms below, and 16 a∣bove
the surface of the water. On the 10th
of August, the ice began to separate, and to
float; we then remarked, that the mass to
which our vessel had been moored, touched
the bottom; for, though the others were all
in motion, and struck against it, and against
each other, it remained immoveable. We
were now afraid of being frozen in, or dashed
to pieces by the ice; we, therefore, endeavour∣ed
to escape from this latitude, though the ves∣sel,
in her course, was obliged to push through
the ice, which made a great noise round us for
a considerable distance: We at last anchored
along another board of ice, where we remain∣ed
that night.'</P>
<P>'During the first watch, the ice began to
split, with an inconceivable noise. The ship's
head kept so strongly to the current in which
the ice-boards floated, that we were obliged to
veer the cable in order to get her off. We
counted above 400 blocks of ice, which sank
<PB N="287" REF="322"/>
10 fathoms below the water, and appeared to
rise about 2 fathoms above it.'</P>
<P>'We then moored the vessel to another block
of ice, which was immersed below the surface
about six fathoms. At a little distance from
this station we perceived a large bank, which
was pointed like a cone, and reached to the
bottom of the sea: We approached it, and
found it to be 20 fathoms below, and about
12 above the surface of the water.'</P>
<P>'On the 11th, we sailed up to another bank,
which was 18 fathoms below the surface, and
10 fathoms above it.'</P>
<P>'The Dutch, on the 21st, advanced a great way
between the boards of ice, and anchored during
the night. Next morning they retired, and
moored to a bank which was 18 fathoms below,
and 10 above the water. They climbed to
the top, and remarked, as a singular phaeno∣menon,
that it was covered with earth, and
that they found there about 40 eggs. Its
colour was a fine azure blue, and totally diffe∣rent
from that of the other masses. This cir∣cumstance
gave rise to various speculations;
some imagining it to be an effect of the ice,
and others thought the whole was a mass of
frozen earth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Troisieme voyage des Hollandois par le Nord, tom. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. p. 46.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>Wafer met with many floating pieces of ice
off Terra del Fuego, which were so large that
<PB N="288" REF="323"/>
he at first imagined them to be islands: Some
of them, he remarks, appeared to be a league or
two in length, and the largest of them seemed to
rise 400 or 500 feet above the surface of the
water.</P>
<P>All these boards of ice, as I have remarked in
the 6th Article, are transported from the rivers
into the sea. Those in the sea of Nova Zembla
and in the Straits of Waigat, come from the
Oby, and, perhaps, from the Jenisca, and
other great rivers in Siberia and Tartary;
those of the Hudson's Straits, from Ascen∣sion-bay,
into which many rivers in North A∣merica
empty themselves; and those of Terra
del Fuego, from the southern continent. If
fewer of them appear in the northern coasts of
Lapland than in those of Siberia and Waigat's
Straits, it is because all the Lapland rivers fall
into the gulf of Bothnia, and none of them in∣to
the north sea. They may likewise be formed
in straits, where the tides rise higher than in the
open sea; and, consequently, where the boards
of ice that float on the surface may accumulate
and produce masses or banks of several fathoms
high. But, with regard to those which rise to
the height of four or five hundred feet, it ap∣pears,
that they can no where be produced but
near very elevated coasts; and I imagine, that,
when the snows which cover these coasts melt,
the water runs down upon the boards of ice,
and, by freezing anew, gradually augment their
<PB N="289" REF="324"/>
size, till they arrive at this amazing height;
that, in a warm summer, the action of the winds,
the agitation of the sea, and perhaps their own
weight, may detach them from the coasts, and
set them adrift; and that they may even be
transported into temperate climates before they
are entirely dissolved.</P>

<HEAD>ARTICLE XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of Seas and Lakes.</HEAD>
<P>THE dry land is every where surrounded
by the ocean: It penetrates, sometimes by
large openings, and sometimes by small straits,
into the interior parts of different countries; and
it forms mediterranean seas, some of which are
affected by the motion of the tides, and others
not. We shall, in this article, trace the ocean
through all its windings; and, at the same time,
give an enumeration of all the mediterranean
seas, which we shall endeavour to distinguish
from what are called bays or gulfs, and lakes.</P>
<P>The sea that washes the western coasts of
France, forms a gulf between Spain and Bri∣tain.
This gulf is, by navigators, called the Bay
<PB N="291" REF="326"/>
of Biscay: It is very open, and advances far∣thest
into the land between Bayonne and St Se∣bastian.
It likewise advances considerably at
Rochelle and Rochefort. This bay begins at
Cape Ortegal, and terminates at Brest, where a
strait commences between the south point of
Britain and Cape Lizard. This strait, which is
at first pretty wide, forms a small bay on the
coast of Normandy, the most advanced point of
which is at Auranche. It continues pretty large
till it arrives at the channel of Calais, where it
is very narrow; it then suddenly enlarges, and
terminates between the Texel and the coast of
Norwich: At the Texel, it forms a small shallow
mediterranean called <HI>Zuidersee,</HI> and several large
gaps or advances, whose waters are not of a con∣siderable
depth.</P>
<P>After this, the ocean forms a large bay called
the <HI>German Sea,</HI> which commences at the north∣most
point of Scotland, and runs along the east
coast of Britain the length of Norwich; and
from thence to the Texel, along the coasts of
Holland and Germany, of Jutland and Norway,
as far as Bergen. This bay may even be con∣sidered
as a mediterranean; for the Orkney
islands nearly shut up its mouth, and seem, by
their direction, to be a continuation of the moun∣tains
of Norway. It forms a large strait, which
commences at the south point of Norway, and
continues pretty broad to the island of Zetland,
where it suddenly contracts, and forms, between
<PB N="292" REF="327"/>
the coasts of Sweden and the islands of Denmark
and Jutland, four small straits; after which, it
widens to a small bay, the most advanced point
of which is at Lubec; from thence, to the south
extremity of Sweden, it continues pretty broad;
then it enlarges more and more, and forms the
Baltic, which is a mediterranean sea, extending,
from south to north, near 300 leagues, if the
gulph of Bothnia, which, in effect, is a continu∣ation
of it, be comprehended. In the Baltic are
two bays, that of Livonia, the most advanced
point of which is near Mittau and Riga, and
that of Finland, which is a branch of the Baltic,
extending between Livonia and Finland to Pe∣tersburgh,
and communicating with lake Ladoga,
and even with lake Onega, which joins the white
sea by means of the river Onega. The whole
body of water which forms the Baltic, the Gulfs
of Bothnia, of Finland, and of Livonia, ought
to be regarded as an immense lake, supported by
a great number of rivers, as the Oder, the Vi∣stula,
the Niemen, the Droine in Germany and
Poland; by other rivers in Livonia and Finland,
by others still more considerable that come from
Lapland, as the Tornea, the Calis, the Lula, the
Pithea, the Uma; and by several from Sweden.
These rivers, which in general are large, amount
in all to more than 40, computing those which
fall into them, and cannot fail to convey a quan∣tity
of water sufficient to supply the Baltic. Be∣sides,
there are no tides in the Baltic, and its
<PB N="293" REF="328"/>
water has very little faltness: And, if the situa∣tion
of the land, and the number of lakes and
marshes in Finland and Sweden, which are con∣tiguous
to the Baltic, be taken into consideration,
we shall be inclined to regard it not as a sea, but
as a great lake formed by the waters which it
receives from the adjacent countries, and which
have forced for themselves a passage near Den∣mark
into the ocean, into which, according to
the relation of voyagers, it still continues to run.</P>
<P>From the commencement of the bay which
goes by the name of the German Sea, and which
terminates beyond Bergen, the ocean follows
the coasts of Norway, Swedish Lapland, North
Lapland, and Muscovite Lapland, at the eastern
part of which it forms a large strait, and gives
rise to the mediterranean called the White Sea,
which may also be considered as a great lake;
for it receives twelve or thirteen large rivers,
which are more than sufficient to supply it with
water; and its water contains but little salt.
Besides, it is within a trifle, in several places, of
communicating with the Baltic; and it has an
evident communication with the gulf of Fin∣land;
for, in ascending the river Onega, we
arrive at a lake of the same name, which is
joined by two rivers to lake Ladoga; and this
last communicates by a large branch with the
gulf of Finland; and there are, in Swedish
Lapland, several places from which the waters
run almost indifferently either into the White
<PB N="294" REF="329"/>
Sea, or into the gulfs of Bothnia and of Fin∣land.
This whole country being full of lakes
and marshes, it, therefore, seems probable, that
the Baltic and White Seas were the receptacles
of its waters, and that, in time, they discharged
themselves into the German and Frozen seas.</P>
<P>On leaving the White Sea, and coasting the
island of Candenos, and the north of Russia, the
ocean advances a small arm into the land at the
mouth of the river Petzora. This arm, which
is about 40 leagues in length, by 8 or 10 in
breadth, may rather be regarded as a collection
of water formed by the river, than as a gulf of
the sea; and it also contains very little salt. In
this place the land runs out in a promontory
terminated by the small islands of Maurice and
of Orange, and between this promontory and
the neighbouring land to the south of Waigat's
straits, there is a bay of about 30 leagues long,
which belongs to the ocean, and is not formed
by rivers. This is succeeded by Waigat's straits,
which lies nearly under the 70th degree of
north latitude; it is not above 8 or 10 leagues
in length, and it communicates with the sea
which washes the north coasts of Siberia. As
this strait is blocked up with ice during the
greatest part of the year, it is very difficult to
penetrate into the sea beyond it. This passage
has been tried in vain by many navigators; and
those who succeeded have not given us exact
charts of this sea, which they call the Pacific
<PB N="295" REF="330"/>
Sea. By the most recent charts, and by the
best globes, it appears, that this sea may be only
a mediterranean, having no connection with the
great sea of Tartary; for it seems to be shut up
and bounded to the south by the country of the
Samoides, which is now well known, and which
extends from the Straits of Waigat to the mouth
of the river Jenisca: To the east, it is bounded
by Jelmorland; to the west by Nova Zembla;
and, though we know not the extent of this
sea to the north and north-east, as the land seems
not to be interrupted, it is probable that the Pa∣cific
Sea is only a mediterranean; and that it is
bounded by land, and has no communication on
that side with the ocean. What establishes this
fact is, that, in departing from the Straits of
Waigat, the whole west and north coasts of No∣va
Zembla, the length of Cape Desire, have been
traversed; that, from this Cape, the coasts of
Nova Zembla have been traced to a small bay
about the 75th degree, where some Dutchmen
passed a dreadful winter in 1596; and that, be∣yond
this gulf, the land of Jelmorland was
discovered in 1664, which is separated from Nova
Zembla only by a few leagues of land; so that
the only land unknown is a small spot near this
little bay just now described; and this spot ex∣ceeds
not, perhaps, 30 leagues in length. If,
therefore, the Pacific Sea joins with the eastern
ocean, it must be by means of this small bay,
which is the only way by which this mediter∣ranean
<PB N="296" REF="331"/>
can have any communication with it.
And, even on the supposition that such a com∣munication
existed, as this bay lies in the 75th
degree of latitude, it would be necessary, to gain
this open sea, to keep five degrees farther north.
It is apparent, therefore, that, in attempting a
north passage to China, it is better to sail beyond
Nova Zembla to the 77th or 78th degree, where
the sea is more open and clearer of ice, than to
persist in passing the frozen straits of Waigat,
when it is even uncertain whether the sea be∣yond
them has any communication with the
eastern ocean.</P>
<P>The coast has been traced from Nova Zem∣bla
and Jelmorland to the mouth of the Chotan∣ga,
which is about the 73d degree; beyond
which an unknow coast extends about 200
leagues. We only know, from the Russians
who travelled by land into these climates, that
the country is not interrupted; and, in their
charts, the rivers are delineated, and they called
the inhabitants <HI>Populi Palati.</HI> This interval of
unknown coast extends from the mouth of the
Chotanga to that of Kauvoina, in the 66th de∣gree
of latitude. The bay of Linchidolin, in
which the Russians fish whales, advances far∣thest
into the land at the mouth of the Len,
which is a considerable river. This bay is very
open, and pertains to the sea of Tartary.</P>
<P>From the mouth of the Len, the northern
coast of Tartary runs about 500 leagues east∣ward
<PB N="297" REF="332"/>
to a peninsula inhabited by a people called
Schelates; it is the most northern point of Tar∣tary,
and lies under the 72d degree of latitude.
In this 500 leagues, the ocean forms neither
bays nor arms; only, from the peninsula of the
Schelates, to the mouth of the Korvinea, the
coast has a considerable winding. This point is
the eastern extremity of the north coast of the
Old Continent, and Cape North in Lapland is the
western extremity. Thus, we have of northern
coast, from Cape North in Lapland, to the extre∣mity
of the country of the Schelates, an extent
of 1700 leagues, including the sinuosities of
bays; and it measures about 1100 leagues in
a straight line.</P>
<P>Let us next take a survey of the eastern coasts
of the Antient Continent, commencing at the
extreme point of the country of the Schelates,
and descending towards the equator. The ocean
first makes a turn between the country of the
Schelates and that of the Tschutschi, which last
projects considerably into the sea. To the south
of this country, there is a small open bay, called
the bay of Suctoikret; this bay is succeeded by
another, which advances, like an arm, about 40
or 50 leagues into the land of Kamtschatka:
After which the ocean flows in, by a narrow
strait, full of small islands, between the southern
point of Kamtschatka and the northern point
of the land of Jesso, and forms a large medi∣terranean,
which we shall now describe in de∣tail.
<PB N="298" REF="333"/>
It consists of the sea of Kamtschatka, in
which there is a considerable island, called
the island of <HI>Amour.</HI> An arm of this sea
runs north-east. But, both this arm and the
sea of Kamtschatka may, at least in part, be
formed by the waters from the rivers which
flow into it from the lands of Kamtschatka, and
those of Tartary. However this matter stands,
the sea of Kamtschatka communications, by a very
long strait, with the sea of Corea, which is ano∣ther
part of this mediterranean; and the whole
together, extending more than 600 leagues in
length, is bounded, on the west and north, by
the lands of Corea and Tartary; and, on the
east and south, by those of Kamtschatka, Jesso,
and Japan, without having any other communi∣cation
with the ocean than by the strait between
Kamtschatka and Jesso; for, it is uncertain
whether the communication between Japan and
the land of Jesso, though laid down in some
charts, has a real existence; and, even supposing
it did exist, the sea of Kamtschatka and that of
Corea would still be regarded as forming toge∣ther
a great mediterranean, separated on all
sides from the ocean, and not as a bay; for it
communicates not with the ocean by its south∣ern
strait, but with the Chinese Sea, which is
rather a mediterranean than a bay.</P>
<P>In the preeceding article, it was remarked, that
the sea had a constant motion from east to west;
and that, consequently, the great Pacific Ocean
<PB N="299" REF="334"/>
is making continual efforts against the eastern
coasts. An accurate examination of the globe
will confirm the conclusions we have drawn
from this observation; for, it appears, that,
from Kamtschatka to New Britain, discovered
by Dampier in 1700, and which lies in the 4th
or 5th degree of south latitude, the ocean has
encroached on these coasts to the extent of 400
leagues; and, of course, that the eastern bounds
of the Old Continent stretch not so far as they
did formerly; for, it is remarkable, that New
Britain and Kamtschatka, which are the most
advanced lands to the east, lie under the same
meridian. Besides, all countries extend farthest
from north to south. Kamtschatka makes a
point of about 160 leagues from north to south,
and this point, the eastern coast of which is
washed by the Pacific Ocean, and the other by
the mediterranean above described, is divided
from north to south by a chain of mountains.
The lands of Japan and of Jesso form another
territory between the ocean and the sea of Co∣rea,
extending from north to south more than
400 leagues; and the direction of the chains of
mountains in Jesso and Japan must be from
north to south; because, in this direction, they
extend 400 leagues; but, from west to east,
they exceed not 50 or 60. Thus, Kamtschatka,
Jesso, and the eastern part of Japan, ought to
be considered as contiguous lands, lying in a
direction from north to south: And, following
<PB N="300" REF="335"/>
the same direction, we find, after the point of
Cape Ava in Japan, the island of Barnevelt, and
three other islands, situated in a line from north
to south, and extending about 100 leagues.
We next meet with three islands, called Calla∣nos,
and after these, the Ladrone islands, to the
number of 14 or 15, all stretching in a line
from north to south, the whole occupying a
space of 300 leagues in length; and the broad∣est
part of these islands, from east to west, ex∣ceeds
not 8 leagues. From these facts, I am
led to conclude, that Kamtschatka, Jesso, the
east part of Japan, the islands of Barnevelt, the
Callanos, and the Ladrones, are a continuation
of the same chain of mountains, and the remains
of an antient country, which has been gradu∣ally
corroded and covered with the sea. All
these countries appear to be nothing but moun∣tains,
of which the islands are the peaks or
points, the low-lands being occupied by the
ocean. What, therefore, is related in the <HI>Lettres
Edesiantes</HI> is true; and, in fact, a number of
islands, called the New Philippines, has been
discovered in the very situation that P. Gobien
supposed them to lie: And, it cannot be doubt∣ed,
that the most easterly of these New Philip∣pines
are a continuation of the chain of moun∣tains
which compose the Ladrones; for these
eastern islands, to the number of eleven, lie in
a line from north to the south, extending in
<PB N="301" REF="336"/>
length more than 200 leagues, and, in breadth,
the largest of them exceeds not eight leagues.</P>
<P>But these conjectures may seem to be bold,
on account of the great distances between the
islands in the neighbourhood of Cape Ava, of
Japan, and of the Callanos, between these islands
and the Ladrones, and between the Ladrones and
the New Philippines, the first interval being
about 160 leagues, the second 50 or 60, and the
third near 120. But it ought to be considered,
that chains of mountains often extend much
farther below the waters of the ocean; and that
these intervals are nothing when compared to
the extent of land, from south to north, in these
islands or mountains, which, beginning at the
interior part of Kamtschatka, is more than 1100
leagues. But, though this idea concerning the
quantity of land gained by the ocean on the
eastern parts of the Old Continent, and the con∣tinuation
of the mountains, should be rejected,
still it must be acknowledged, that Kamtschatka,
Jesso, Japan, the islands of Rois, Formosa, Vaif,
Basha, Babuyane, Lucca, Mindano, Gilolo, &amp;c.
and, lastly, New Guinea, which extends to New
Britain, and is situated under the same meridian
as Kamtschatka, form a stretch of country of
more than 2200 leagues, with small interrup∣tions,
the greatest of which exceeds not, per∣haps,
20 leagues; so that the ocean has scooped
out an immense bay from the interior parts of
the eastern continent, which begins at Kamt∣schatka,
<PB N="302" REF="337"/>
and terminates at New Britain. This
bay is interspersed with numerous islands, and
has all the appearances of being gained from
the land. It is, therefore, probable, that the
ocean, by its constant motion from east to west,
has gradually gained this great tract of country
from the continent, and has formed several me∣diterraneans,
as those of Kamtschatka, of Corea,
of China, and perhaps the whole Indian Archi∣pelago;
for the land and the water are so blen∣ded
together in this region, that it evidently ap∣pears
to have been a large country destroyed by
inundations, of which only the eminences and
mountainous parts are now to be seen, the low∣er
grounds being entirely concealed under the
waters of the ocean. This hypothesis is farther
confirmed by the shallowness of the sea, and
the figures of the innumerable islands, which
seem to be nothing but the tops of moun∣tains.</P>
<P>If we take a more particular survey of these
seas, we will find, that the northern part of the
Chinese sea forms itself into a great bay, which
begins at the island of Fungma, and terminates
at the frontiers of the province of Pekin, about
50 leagues from this capital of the Chinese em∣pire.
The most advanced and narrowest part of
this bay is called the gulf of Changi. It is pro∣bable
that this gulf, and part of the sea of China,
are encroachments of the ocean, and that the
islands above described are the most elevated
<PB N="303" REF="338"/>
parts of the antient country. Farther south are
the bays of Tonquin and of Siam, in the neigh∣bourhood
of which is the peninsula of Malacca,
consisting of a long chain of mountains that run
from north to south; and the Andaman islands,
which form another chain of mountains, in the
same direction, seem to be only a continuation
of the mountains of Sumatra.</P>
<P>After this the ocean forms the great bay of
Bengal; where it may be remarked, that the
land of the peninsula of Indus makes a concave
curve, towards the east, nearly resembling the
great bay of the eastern continent, which seems
to have been produced by the same cause, name∣ly,
the motion of the sea from east to west. In
this peninsula are the mountains of Gates, which
extend from north to south; and the island of
Ceylon appears to have been separated from this
part of the continent.</P>
<P>The Maldiva islands are nothing but another
chain of mountains stretching from north to
south. Then follows the Arabian gulph, which
sends off four branches or arms; the two largest
are on the west coast, and the two smallest on the
east. The first arm on the east coast is the bay
of Cambaia, which extends not above 50 or 60
leagues; but it receives two considerable rivers,
the Tapta and the Baroche or Mehi. The se∣cond
arm or bay on the same coast is remark∣able
for the rapidity and height of its tides,
which alternately advance and retreat more than
<PB N="304" REF="339"/>
50 leagues. Into this bay fall several rivers, as
the Indus, the Padar, &amp;c. which have brought
down sand and mud in such quantities as to ele∣vate
the bottom of the bay, and reduce it nearly
to a perfect level. It is owing to this circum∣stance
that the tides extend to so great a distance.
The first arm on the west coast is the Persic
gulf, which advances into the land above 250
leagues; and the second is the Red Sea, which,
reckoning from the island of Socotora, extends
above 680 leagues. From the straits of Ormuz
and of Babelmandel, these two arms should be
considered as mediterranean seas: They are
both, indeed affected with the tides; but this is
occasioned by their vicinity to the equator,
where the tides <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> higher than in other climates.
Besides, they are both very long and very nar∣row.
The motion of the tides is more rapid in
the Red Sea than in the Persic gulf; because the
former is nearly three times as long, and equally
narrow, as the latter; neither does it receive
any river capable of resisting the tide: But the
Persic gulf receives three large rivers at its most
advanced extremity. It is apparent, that the
Red Sea has been formed by an irruption of the
ocean; for the situation and similarity in the
direction of the coasts on each side of the straits
of Babelmandel demonstrate, that this passage
has been cut by the waters.</P>
<P>At the extremity of the Red Sea lies that fa∣mous
strip of land called the Isthmus of Suez,
<PB N="305" REF="340"/>
which is a barrier to the junction of the Red
Sea with the Mediterranean. In the preceding
article, I gave the reasons which render it pro∣bable
that the Red Sea is higher than the Me∣diterranean,
and that, if the Isthmus were cut,
an inundation and increase of the latter would
be the consequence. It may here be added,
that, though the superior elevation of the Red
Sea should not be allowed, yet, that there are no
tides in the Mediterranean near the mouths of
the Nile, is an uncontestible fact. It is equally
certain, that the tides in the Red Sea rise several
feet; and this circumstance alone, on the suppo∣sition
of the removal of the Isthmus, would oc∣casion
a great influx of water from the Red Sea
into the Mediterranean. Besides, Varenius, in
his geography<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 100.</NOTE>, remarks, 'Oceanus Germa∣nicus,
qui est Atlantici pars, inter Frisiam
et Hollandiam se effundens, efficit sinum, qui,
etsi parvus sit respectu celebrium sinuum ma∣ris,
tamen et ipse dicitur mare, alluitque Hol∣landiae

qui etiam mare Harlemense dicitur.
Hujus altitudo non est minor altitudine sinus

Quoniam itaque nec lacus hic, neque si∣nus

agros, (de naturali constitutione loquor, non
<PB N="306" REF="341"/>

ocean, therefore, is higher than the sea of Hol∣land,
there is nothing to prevent us from be∣lieving
that the Red Sea may be higher than the
Mediterranean. Herodotus and Diodorus Si∣culus
mention a canal of communication be∣tween
the Nile, the Mediterranean, and the Red
Sea: And M. de l'Isle, in 1704, published a
map, in which he has laid down the termination
of a canal in the east branch of the Nile, which
he imagined to be a part of that which former∣ly
joined that river to the Red Sea<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mem. de l'Acad. des Sciences, année, 1704.</NOTE> We meet
<PB N="307" REF="342"/>
with the same opinion in a book entitled <HI>Con∣noissance
de l'Ancien Monde</HI>; where the author,
copying Diodorus Siculus, farther informs us,
that this canal was begun by Neco King of
Egypt; that Darius King of Persia continued
the work; that it was finished by Ptolomy II.
who conducted it to the city of Arsinoa; and
that it could be shut and opened at pleasure. I
pretend not to deny these facts; but, I confess,
they appear to be doubtful. I suspect, that the
violence and height of the tides, in the Red Sea,
would necessarily produce and communicate
their influence to the waters of the canal: At
least, it would require great precaution to pre∣vent
inundations, and to keep the canal in pro∣per
repair. Though we are told by historians
that this canal was begun and finished, they are
silent as to its duration; and the remains of it,
which are pretended still to exist, are perhaps
all that was ever executed. This branch of the
ocean has been denominated the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> be∣cause,
wherever there are madrepores or corals
at the bottom, the water of it has the appearance
of this colour. The following description of it
is given in the <HI>Histoire Generale des Voyages</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tom. 1. p. 198.</NOTE>:
'Before leaving the Red Sea, D. Jean inquired
into the causes which induced the antients to
give it this appellation: He recollected, that
Pliny had delivered several opinions concer∣ning
the origin of this name. Some derived it
<PB N="308" REF="343"/>
from a King of that country called <HI>Erythros,</HI>
which, in the Greek language, signifies <HI>Red</HI>:
Others imagined that the red colour was occa∣sioned
by the reflection of the sun from the
surface of the water; and others affirmed the
water itself to be red. The Portuguese, who
had made several voyages in that sea, alledged,
that the whole coast of Arabia was remarkably
red; and that the dust and sand carried into
the sea by the winds tinged the water with the
same colour.'</P>
<P>'Dom Jean, who examined the nature of the
water and of the coasts, through their whole
extent, with the most scrupulous attention, as∣sures
us, that the waters of this sea have no
peculiarity in their colour, and that the dust
and sand, not being red themselves, could not
possibly communicate this colour to the water.
The land on each side, he observes, is gene∣rally
brown; in some places, it is black, and,
in others, white: At Suaquem, the coasts of
which the Portuguese never visited, there are
three mountains striped with red; but they
consist of hard rocks, and the neighbouring
ground is of the usual colour.'</P>
<P>'The truth is, that this sea is all of the same
uniform colour, of which any man may satis∣fy
himself by drawing water from different
parts. But, it must be acknowledged, that, in
some places, it appears, by accident, to be red,
and, in others, green and white. This phae∣nomenon
<PB N="309" REF="344"/>
admits of the following explication.
From Suaquem to Kossir, which is an extent of
136 leagues, the sea is filled with banks and
rocks of coral; they are so called from their
resembling coral in form and colour so exact∣ly,
that it is difficult to perceive the distinction:
There are two kinds of them, the one is white,
and the other extremely red. In many places,
they are covered with a kind of gum, or viscid
substance, of a green colour, and sometimes of
a deep orange. Now the water of this sea is
so transparent, that the bottom is visible at the
depth of twenty fathoms, especially from
Suaquem to the extremity of the gulf; and
hence the water assumes, in appearance, the co∣lour
of the bodies which it covers. When,
for example, the rocks are overlaid with a
green gum, the water abover them appears to
be green; when the bottom is sand alone, the
superincumbent water seems to be white; and,
when the rocks are covered with coral, the
water above them appears to be reddish. But,
as the rocks of this colour are more frequent
than the green or white, Dom Jean concludes,
that the Arabic Gulf has, from this circum∣stance,
obtained the name of the Red Sea.
He was the more satisfied with this discovery,
because the method he employed in the inve∣stigation
of it left no room for hesitation or
doubt. In such places as were not deep e∣nough
to allow his vessel to sail, he fastened
<PB N="310" REF="345"/>
pinks opposite to the rocks; and the sailors
were enabled to execute his orders, at more
than half a league from the rocks, without be∣ing
immersed above the middle of their bodies.
In those places where the water appeared red,
the greatest part of the stones and pebbles they
brought up were of the same colour; where
the water appeared green, the stones were
green also; and where the water appeared
white, the bottom was a pure white sand.'</P>
<P>From the entrance to the Red Sea, at Cape
Gardafu, to the Cape of Good Hope, the direc∣tion
of the coast is pretty equal, and the sea
forms no bays of any note. There is, indeed, a
small scoop on the coast of Melinda, which, if
the Island of Madagascar were united to the
continent, might be considered as a part of a
large bay. This island, it is true, though sepa∣rated
by the straits of Mozambigue, appears to
have formerly belonged to the continent; for,
in this strait, there are deep sands of great ex∣tent,
especially on the Madagascar coast, which
make the open part of it very narrow.</P>
<P>From the Cape of Good Hope to Cape
Negro, on the west coast of Africa, the land lies
in the same direction; and the whole of it
seems to be a chain of mountains: It is, at least,
a very elevated country, and, though more than
500 leagues in length, it it is furnished with no
rivers of any consideration, excepting one or
two, which are, known no farther than their
<PB N="311" REF="346"/>
mouths. But the coasts, above Cape Negro,
makes a large curve; and the land, along this
curve, appears to be lower than that of the rest
of Africa: It is watered by several great rivers,
the largest of which are the Coanza and the
Zaire. From Cape Negro to Cape Gonsalvez,
are the mouths of 24 considerable rivers; and
the space between these two capes, reckoning
along the shore, is about 420 leagues. We
would be tempted to think, that the ocean has
encroached on these low lands of Africa, not by
its natural motion from east to west, which could
have no influence in producing this effect, but
by the facility with which it might have under∣mined
and surmounted them. From Cape Gon∣salvez
to Cape Trois-pointes, the ocean forms
an open bay, which presents nothing remark∣able,
excepting a very advanced point nearly in
the middle of it, called <HI>Cape Formosa</HI>: It like∣wise
contains, in the southern part of it, the
islands of Fernandpo, St Thomas, and Prince's
Island. These islands appear to be a continua∣tion
of a chain of mountains situated between
Rie del Rey, and the river Jamoer. From Cape
Trois-pointes to Cape Palmas, the ocean runs
a little in upon the land; and from Cape
Palmas to Cape Tagrin, there is nothing wor∣thy
of remark. But, beyond Cape Tagrin,
there is a small bay in the country of Sierra-Leona;
and a little farther, there is another, in
which are situated the islands of Bisagas. After
<PB N="312" REF="347"/>
this we meet with Cape Verd, which projects far
into the sea, and of which the islands of the same
name appear to be a continuation; or, rather,
they seem to be a continuation of Cape Blanc,
which is a more elevated country, and stretches
still farther into the ocean. We next come to
a mountainous and dry coast, which commences
at Cape Blanc, and terminates at Cape Bajador:
The Canary islands seem to be a continuation of
these mountains. Lastly, between Africa and
Portugal, is a large open bay, in the middle of
which are the celebrated straits of Gibraltar.
The ocean pours its waters, with great rapidity,
through this strait into the Mediterranean. This
sea runs into the interior parts of the land near
900 leagues, and gives rise to many objects
worthy of remark. 1<HI>st,</HI> It has no tides that are
perceptible, excepting in the Gulf of Venice;
and a small flux and reflux have been alledged to
take place at Marseilles and on the coast of Tri∣poli.
2<HI>d,</HI> It contains many large islands, as
Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, Cyprus, Majorca, &amp;c.
and Italy, which is one of the most extensive
peninsula's in the world: It is likewise adorned
with a rich Archipelago, or rather, it is from the
Mediterranean Archipelago that all other collec∣tions
of islands have acquired that appellation.
But this Archipelago appears to belong more
properly to the Black Sea than to the Mediter∣ranean;
and it is probable, that the country of
Greece was partly covered with the Black Sea,
<PB N="313" REF="348"/>
which runs into the sea of Marmora, and from
that into the Mediterranean.</P>
<P>It has been alledged, that a double current
runs through the Straits of Gibraltar; one supe∣rior,
which carries the water from the ocean in∣to
the Mediterranean, and another inferior,
which carries the waters from the Mediterrane∣an
back to the ocean. But this notion is false,
and contrary to the known laws of hydrostatics.
These opposite currents have been ascribed to
several other straits, as the Bosphorus, the straits
of the Sund, &amp;c.; and Marsilli has related ma∣ny
experiments tending to prove the existence
of a superior and inferior current in the Bos∣phorus.
These experiments, however, must
have been fallacious; for such a phaenomenon
is repugnant to the nature and motion of fluids.
Beside, Greaves, in his <HI>Pyramidographie,</HI> has de∣monstrated,
by accurate experiments, that there
are no opposite currents in the Bosphorus. Mar∣silli
and others may have been deceived by the
regorging of the water near the shores, which
takes place in the Bosphorus, in the straits of
Gibraltar, and in all rapid rivers, and which oft∣en
produces a motion opposite to that of the
principal current.</P>
<P>Let us now briefly run over the coasts of the
New Continent. We shall begin with Cape
Hold-with-hope, which is situated in the 73d
degree of North Latitude. This is the most
northerly point of land in New Greenland, and
<PB N="314" REF="349"/>
is distant from Cape North in Lapland about
160 or 180 leagues. From this cape the coast
of Greenland might be traced to the polar circle,
where the ocean forms a large strait between
Iceland and Greenland. Some maintain, that
this country in the neighbourhood of Iceland is
not the Antient Greenland, formerly possessed
by the Danes as a province dependent on that
kingdom; its inhabitants were civilized Christi∣ans,
who had bishops, churches, and a number
of towns proportioned to their trade. The Danes
had a communication with them as easy, and as
frequent, as the Spaniards with the Canary
islands: There still exists, it is said, laws and
regulations respecting the government of this
province, and these not of a very antient date.
However, without forming any conjectures how
this country came to be absolutely lost, we find
not, in New Greenland, the least vestige of what
is here related. They are mere savages: They
have no buildings: There is not a word in their
language that has the smallest affinity to the
Danish tongue; and there is not a single cir∣cumstance
from which we can infer it to be the
same country. It is even almost a desert, and
is covered with snow and ice the greatest part
of the year. But, as these lands are of vast ex∣tent,
and, as the coasts have been little frequent∣ed
by modern navigators, they may have mis∣sed
the place occupied by the descendents of
these polished people; or the increase of the ice
<PB N="315" REF="350"/>
in this sea may now, perhaps, prevent all access
to them. If, however, maps can be trusted, the
whole coast of this country is known: It forms
a large peninsula, at the extremity of which are
the two straits of Frobisher and of Friesland,
where the cold is excessive, although they are
not farther north than the Orkneys, that is, a∣bout
60 degrees.</P>
<P>Between the west coast of Greenland, and
that of Labrador, the ocean forms a gulf, and
then a large mediterranean, which is the coldest
of all seas, and its coasts are little known. In
pursuing this gulf, we meet with Davis's strait,
which leads to the Christian sea, which termi∣nates
in Baffin's bay, through which there ap∣pears
to be an outlet into Hudson's bay. The
strait of Cumberland, which, like that of Davis,
may lead into the Christian sea, is more narrow
and more subject to be frozen. Hudson's strait,
though much farther south, is also frozen for
some part of the year: And it is remarkable,
that the tides are very high in these seas and
straits, although no tides take place in the inland
seas of Europe, as the Baltic and Mediterranean.
This difference seems to be occasioned by the
motion of the sea from east to west, which pro∣duces
high tides in straits opposite to the current
of the waters, or whose mouths open to the east.
Whereas, in those of Europe, which open to the
west, there are no tides. The ocean, by its ge∣neral
movement, rushes into the former, but
<PB N="316" REF="351"/>
from the latter; and this is the reason why
the tides are so violent in the seas of China,
Corea, and Kamtschatka.</P>
<P>In sailing down Hudson's bay towards La∣brador,
there is a narrow opening, which Davis,
in 1586, traversed for about 30 leagues, and
traded with the inhabitants. But no attempts
have hitherto been made to discover the whole
of this arm of the sea. We know nothing of
the neighbouring country, but the land of the
Esquimaux. Fort Pon-chartrin is the only set∣tlement,
and the most northerly part of this
country; and it is separated from the island of
Newfoundland by the small strait of Belleisle,
which is little frequented. As the eastern coast
of Newfoundland has the same direction with
that of Labrador, this island appears to have
been formerly a part of the continent, in the
same manner as Isle-Royal seems to have been
detached from Acadia. The bottoms of the
great bank, and of the lesser banks on which the
cod-fishery is carried on, are not deep; but, as
they shelve a great way under water, they pro∣duce
violent currents. Between Cape Breton
and Newfoundland, there is a pretty large strait,
which is the mouth of a small mediterranean,
called the <HI>Gulf of St Laurence.</HI> It sends off a
branch, which extends a considerable way into
the country, and appears to be only the mouth
of the river of that name. In this arm of the
sea the tides are very perceptible; and, even at
<PB N="317" REF="352"/>
Quebec, which is farther up the country, the
waters rise several feet. Leaving the gulf of St
Laurence, and following the coast of Acadia, we
meet with a small gulf called <HI>Boston-Bay,</HI> which
is of a square figure, and advances but a little way
into the land. But, before we pursue this coast
any farther, it is worthy of remark, that, from
Newfoundland to Guiana, the ocean forms an
immense bay, that runs in upon the land as
far as Florida, which is more than 500 leagues.
This bay is similar to that of the Old Con∣tinent
above described, where the ocean, af∣ter
forming a large gulf between Kamtschatka
and New Britain, gives rise to a great mediter∣ranean,
which comprehends the seas of Kamt∣schatka,
of Corea, of China, &amp;c. In the same
manner, in the New Continent, the ocean, after
forming a large gulf between Newfoundland
and Guiana, gives rise to a great mediterranean,
extending from the Antilles to Mexico; which
confirms what we have advanced concerning the
motion of the sea from east to west: For it ap∣pears
that the ocean has gained as much territory
on the east of America as on the east coast
of Asia. Besides, these great gulfs in each con∣tinent
lie under the same degrees of latitude,
and are nearly of equal extent. Such singular
relations, it would appear, must have been pro∣duced
by the same cause.</P>
<P>If we examine the position of the Antilles,
beginning with the island of Trinidad, which is
<PB N="318" REF="353"/>
the southmost, it is impossible to doubt but that
Trinidad, Tobago, the Granades, St Vincent,
Martinico, Marygalante, Antego, Barbadoes,
and all the adjacent isles, once formed a chain
of mountains which extended from south to
north, like Newfoundland and the country of
the Esquimaux. Farther, the direction of the
Antilles from east to west, if we begin with Bar∣badoes,
and pass on to St Bartholomy, Porto-Rico,
St Domingo, and Cuba, is nearly the same
with the coasts of Cape Breton, Acadia, and
New England. All these islands lie so close to∣gether,
that they may be regarded as a continued
belt of land, and as the most elevated parts of a
country now occupied by the sea. Most of them,
in effect, are nothing but the tops of mountains;
and the sea between them and the continent is a
true mediterranean, in which the tides are not
much more perceptible than in our Mediterra∣nean,
although the straits between the islands
are directly opposite to the motion of the sea
from east to west, which should contribute to
raise the tides in the gulf of Mexico. But, as
this gulf is very broad, the waters elevated by
the tide, being expanded over a large surface,
hardly produce any sensible change upon the
coast of Louisianna and several other places.</P>
<P>Both the Old and New Continents, therefore,
appear to have been encroached upon by the
ocean in the same latitudes: Both are furnished
with a great mediterranean, and a vast number
<PB N="319" REF="354"/>
of islands, which likewise lie nearly in the same
latitudes. The only difference is, that the Old
Continent, being much larger than the New, has
a mediterranean on its west coast, to which the
New Continent has nothing analogous. But
both seem to have undergone similar revolutions;
these revolutions are greatest near their middle
parts, or between the tropics, where the motion
of the sea is most violent.</P>
<P>The coasts of Guiana, from the mouth of the
river Oronoko to that of the Amazones, offer
nothing remarkable. But the Amazones, which
is the largest river in the universe, forms a con∣siderable
sheet of water near Coropa, before it
discharges itself into the sea by the two mouths
which sorround the island of Caviana. From
the mouth of the Amazones to Cape St Roche,
the river runs almost straight east; from Cape
St Roche to Cape St Augustine, it runs south;
and from Cape St Augustine, to the bay of All
Saints, it runs westward in such a manner that
this part of Brasil projects considerably into the
ocean, which is directly opposite to a similar
projection of the African coast. The bay of
All Saints is a small arm of the sea, which ad∣vances
about 50 leagues into the land, and is
much frequented by navigators. From this bay,
to Cape St Thomas, the coast runs straight south,
and from thence, in a south-west direction, to
the mouth of the Plata, where an arm of the
sea projects about 100 leagues into the land.
<PB N="320" REF="355"/>
From this river, to the southern extremity of
America, the ocean forms a large bay, which is
terminated by Falkland Island, Cape Assumption,
and other lands bordering on Terra del Fuego.
At the bottom of this bay is the strait of Magel∣lan,
the longest in the universe, and where the
tides rise very high. Beyond this is the strait
of La Maire, which is much shorter; and, <HI>lastly,</HI>
Cape Horn, which is the south point of Ame∣rica.</P>
<P>On the subject of points or head-lands, it is
remarkable, that they all regard the south, and
that most of them are cut by straits that run
from east to west. The point of South America
regards the Arctic Pole, and it is cut by the strait
of Magellan: That of Greenland, which like∣wise
has a southern aspect, is cut from east
to west by the strait of Frobisher: That of Afri∣ca
regards also the south, and, beyond the Cape
of Good Hope, are banks and shoals which ap∣pear
to have been separated from it: That of
the peninsula of India is cut by the strait be∣tween
it and island of Ceylon; and, like all
others, projects southward. These are facts;
but we are unable to give any explication of
them.</P>
<P>From Terra del Fuego, all along the west coast
of South America, the ocean makes considerable
advances into the land; and this coast seems to
follow exactly the direction of the high moun∣tains
which traverse this part of the continent
<PB N="321" REF="356"/>
from south to north, from the Equator to the
Arctic Pole. Near the Line, the ocean forms a
large bay, extending from Cape St Francois to
Panama, that famous isthmus, which, like that
of Suez, prevents the junction of the two seas.
If these two necks of land were removed, both
the Old and the New Continent would be di∣vided
into two distinct portions. From Panama
to California, there occurs nothing worthy of
remark. Between the peninsula of California
and New Mexico, is a long arm of the ocean,
called the <HI>Vermilion Sea,</HI> which is more than 200
leagues long. In fine, the west coast of Cali∣fornia
has been traced to the 43d degree of la∣titude.
It was in this latitude that Drake, who
first discovered the land to the north of Califor∣nia,
and which he called <HI>New Albion,</HI> was o∣bliged,
by the rigour of the cold, to change his
course, and to anchor in a small bay which
bears his name; so that the countries beyond
the 43d or 44th degree, in this part of the globe,
are as little known as those of North America
beyond the 48th degree, which is inhabited by
the Moozemleki, and the 51st, which is inha∣bited
by the Assiniboils; the territory of the for∣mer
savages extends much farther west than that
of the latter. All beyond, for 1000 leagues in
length, and as much in breadth, is totally un∣known,
unless the Russians, as they pretend,
have made some discoveries by departing from
<PB N="322" REF="357"/>
Kamtschatka, and visiting the eastern coasts of
North America.</P>
<P>The ocean, then, surrounds the whole globe,
without interruption, and we may sail round it
by taking our departure from the south point
of America. But we are still uncertain whether
the ocean surrounds, in the same manner, the
north part of the globe; and all the navigators,
who have attempted to go from Europe to Chi∣na
by the north-east or north-west, have equally
failed in their enterprises.</P>
<P>Lakes differ from mediterraneans; the former
derive no water from the ocean; on the con∣trary,
when they communicate with seas, they
are constantly discharging water into them.
Thus the Black Sea, which some geographers
have regarded as a branch of the Mediterranean,
and, of course, as an appendage of the ocean, is
only a lake; because, in place of receiving any
supplies from the Mediterranean, its waters run
with rapidity through the Bosphorus, in the
lake called the Sea of Marmora, and from thence
through the straits of the Dardanelles into the
Grecian Sea. The Black Sea is about 250 leagues
long, and 100 broad: It receives a number
of large rivers, as the Danube, the Nieper, the
Don, the Boh, the Donjec, &amp;c. The Don,
which unites with the Donjec, before it arrives
at the Black Sea, forms a lake called the <HI>Palus
Meotis,</HI> which is more than 100 leagues in
length, and from 20 to 25 in breadth. The Sea
<PB N="323" REF="358"/>
of Marmora, which is below the Black Sea, is a
lake smaller than the Palus Meotis, being not
above 50 leagues long, and 8 or 9 broad.</P>
<P>It is related by some of the antients, and par∣ticularly
by Diodorus Siculus, that the Euxine,
or Black Sea, was originally a great river or
lake, and had no communication with the Greek
Sea; but that its waters were, in the course of
time, so greatly augmented by the rivers that
fall into it, that they forced a passage, first by
the islands of Cyanea, and then by the Helle∣spont.
This opinion has great probability on
its side; and, I think, it is no difficult matter to
explain how the operation was effected: For,
supposing the bottom of the Black Sea to have
been formerly much lower than it is now, the
mud and sand carried down by the rivers would
gradually raise it, till the surface of the water
was elevated above that of the land, and then
the water would necessarily find a passage for
itself: And, as the rivers continue still to trans∣port
sand and earth, and as, at the same time,
the quantity of water in the rivers diminishes in
proportion as the mountains from which they
spring are lowered, it may happen, in the course
of ages, that the Bosphorus will again be filled
up. But, as effects of this nature depend on
many causes, we must content ourselves with
simple conjectures. Mr Tournesort, on the au∣thority
of the antients, says, that the Black Sea,
which receives the waters of a great part of Eu∣rope
<PB N="324" REF="359"/>
and Asia, after being considerably augment∣ed,
opened to itself a passage by the Bosphorus,
and either formed the Mediterranean, or in∣creased
its waters to such a degree, that they
forced a passage to the ocean through the straits
of Gibraltar; and that the island of Atalantis,
mentioned by Planto, was, on this occasion, total∣ly
overflowed. This notion cannot be support∣ed;
for the ocean runs into the Mediterranean,
and not the Mediterranean into the ocean. Be∣sides,
M. Tournefort has not combined two es∣sential
facts, though he has mentioned both of
them. The first is, that the Black Sea receives
9 or 10 rivers, each of which furnishes more
water than is discharged by the Bosphorus; and
the second, that the Mediterranean does not re∣ceive
more water from rivers than the Black
Sea, though it be seven or eight times larger;
and what it receives from the Bosphorus is not
the tenth part of what falls into the Black Sea.
How, therefore, could this tenth part of the
water that falls into a small sea, produce not on∣ly
a larger sea, but augment its waters to such a
degree as would enable it to break down the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Gibraltar, and overwhelm an island
of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> extent than the whole of Europe?
It is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to perceive that M. Tournefort has
not sufficiently considered this matter. The
Mediterranean derives from the ocean at least
ten times the quantity of water it receives from
the Black Sea; for the narrowest part of the
<PB N="325" REF="360"/>
Bosphorus exceeds not 800 pace, while that of
the straits of Gibraltar is more than 5000; and,
supposing the velocities of both to be equal, still
the water in the straits of Gibraltar is by much
the deepest.</P>
<P>M. Tournefort, who ridicules Polybius for
predicting that the Bosphorus will in time be
filled up, has not attended sufficiently to circum∣stances,
otherwise he would not have pronoun∣ced
the impossibility of such an event. Must
not the Black Sea, which constantly receives the
sand and mud of eight or ten large rivers, gra∣dually
fill up? Must not the winds and the na∣tural
current of the waters continually transport
part of these matters into the Bosphous? It is,
therefore, extremely probable, that, in the course
of ages, the Bosphorus will be choaked up, when
the quantity of water discharged by the rivers
into the Black Sea shall be greatly diminished.
Now, the rivers are diminishing daily, because
the mountains, which collect the dews, and give
rise to the rivers, are continually diminishing.</P>
<P>The Black Sea receives more water from ri∣vers
than the Mediterranean; and Mr Tourne∣fort
observes, on this subject, 'That the greatest
rivers in Europe fall into this sea by means of
the Danube, into which are discharged the ri∣vers
of Subia, Franconia, Bavaria, Austria,
Hungary, Moravia, Corinthia, Croatia, Both∣nia,
Servia, Transylvania, and Wallachia: The
rivers of Black Russia and of Podolia fall like∣wise
<PB N="326" REF="361"/>
wise into the same sea by means of the Niester;
those of the southern and eastern parts of Po∣land,
of the northern part of Muscovy, and of
the country of the Cossacks, fall into it, either
by the Nieper or Boristhenes; the Tanais and
the Copa empty themselves into the Black Sea
by the Cimmerian Bosphorus; the rivers of
Mingrelia, the principal of which is the Phasis,
also discharge their contents into this sea, and
likewise the Casalmac, the Sangaris, and other
rivers of Asia Minor which take a northern
course: These vast discharges notwithstanding,
the Thracian Bosphorus, which is the only out∣let
from the Black Sea, is not comparable to
any one of these great rivers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See voyage du Levant de Tournefort, vol. 2. p. 123.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>All these facts demonstrate the great quantity
of water carried off by evaporation; and it is
owing to this circumstance that the ocean con∣stantly
runs into the Mediterranean by the straits
of Gibraltar. It is difficult to ascertain the quan∣tity
of water received by any sea; it requires an
exact knowledge of the breadth, depth, and ve∣locity
of all the rivers that fall into it, of their
augmentation and diminution in different sea∣sons
of the year; and of the quantity which the
sea loses by evaporation. This last is the most
difficult to determine; for, supposing evapora∣tion
to be proportioned to the surfaces, it will
be greater in a warm than in a cold climate.
Besides, water mixed with salt and bitumen eva∣porates
<PB N="327" REF="362"/>
more slowly than fresh water; a sea sub∣ject
to great agitations evaporates more quickly
than a calm sea; and a difference in the depth
has also some effect. In fine, so many particu∣lars
are included in the theory of evaporation,
that it is not possible to make an exact estima∣tion
of it.</P>
<P>The water of the Black Sea is less clear, and
less salt than that of the ocean. There are no
islands in it; and its tempests are more violent
and more dangerous than those of the ocean;
because its waters, being extended in a basin
which has but an inconsiderable outlet, move,
when agitated, in a kind of whirlpools, which
beat upon all sides of a vessel with an insupport∣able
violence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See voyages de Chardin, p. 142.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>After the Black Sea, the greatest lake in the
world is the Caspian Sea, which extends from
south to north about 300 leagues, and its mean
breadth exceeds not 50. This lake receives the
Wolga, besides several other considerable rivers,
as the Kur, the Faie, and the Gempo. But,
what is singular, it receives not one river from
the east coast; the country on that side is a san∣dy
desert, which remained, till lately, altogether
unknown. The Czar Peter I. sent engineers to
make a chart of the Caspian Sea. It had been
represented as round by former geographers;
but it is very long and very narrow. Its east∣ern
coast, and the neighbouring country, were
<PB N="328" REF="363"/>
entirely unknown; even Lake Aral, which is
about 100 leagues east of the Caspian, was ei∣ther
not known to exist, or was considered as a
part of this sea. Thus, before the discoveries
of the Czar, there was in this region an un∣known
country of 300 leagues in length, and
100 or 150 in breadth. Lake Aral is nearly
oblong, and about 90 or 100 leagues long, and
50 or 60 broad. It receives the Sideroias and
the Oxus, two large rivers; but, like the Cas∣pian,
it has no outlet for discharging its waters;
and, as the Caspian receives no rivers from the
east, Lake Aral, on the contrary, receives none
from the west. Hence it is presumable, that
these two formerly constituted but one lake;
and the rivers being gradually choaked up, the
country between them would necessarily be co∣vered
with sand. There are some small islands in
the Caspian; and its waters are much fresher than
those of the ocean. Storms, in this sea, are ex∣ceedingly
dangerous; and it affords not navi∣gation
to large vessels, on account of shoals,
sand-banks, and rocks concealed under the sur∣face.
'The largest vessels employed on the
Caspian,' says Pietro della Valle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tom. 3. p. 235.</NOTE> 'along the
coasts of the province of Mazanda in Persia,
where stands the town of Ferhabad, although
they be called <HI>ships,</HI> are no better than our tar∣tanes:
Their sides are high; they draw little wa∣ter,
and are flat-bottomed. They are built of this
<PB N="329" REF="364"/>
construction, not only because this sea is shal∣low
near the coasts, but because it is full of
shoals and sand-banks; so that no other vessels
could be used with safety. I was surprised
to see no fishing carried on at Ferhabad, ex∣cepting
salmons at the mouth of the river, a
bad kind of sturgeon, and other fresh water
fishes of no value. I attributed this to their
ignorance of navigation and of the art of fish∣ing,
till I was informed by the Cham of Ester∣abad,
that this sea, at the distance of 20 or 30
miles from the shore, is so shallow, that nets
could not be used with advantage; and that
the same reason accounted for the construction
of their vessels, which carry no cannon, because
the Caspian is not infested with pirates.'</P>
<P>Struys, Avril, and others, affirm, that, in the
neighbourhood of Kilan, there are two gulfs,
which swallow up the waters of the Caspian, and
carry them, by subterraneous passages, into the
Persic Gulf. De Fer, and other geographers,
have laid down these gulfs in their maps,
though we are assured by the Czar's envoys,
that they have no existence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mem. de l'Acad. des Sciences, année 1721.</NOTE>. The fact, with
regard to the willow leaves found on the Persic
Gulf, and which are alledged by the same au∣thors
to be transported from the Caspian Sea,
because no willows grow near the Persic Gulf,
appears to be equally improbable as the subter∣raneous
passages, which Gemelli Careri, as well
<PB N="330" REF="365"/>
as the Russians, maintain to be altogether ima∣ginary.
Besides, the Caspian is about a third less
than the Black Sea, which last also receives more
water by rivers; evaporation, therefore, is a∣lone
sufficient to carry off all its adventitious wa∣ters,
without the assistance of imaginary gulfs,
or subterraneous passages.</P>
<P>There are lakes, or seas, which neither re∣ceive
nor discharge rivers; there are others
which both receive and discharge; and others
which only receive rivers. The Caspian, Lake
Aral, and the Dead Sea, are of the last kind:
In Asia Minor, there is a small lake of the same
species: There is another still larger in Persia,
upon which the city of Marago is situated: It is
of an oval figure, and about 10 or 12 leagues
long, and 6 or 7 broad: It receives the Tauris,
which is not a very considerable river. If to
these we add a small lake of the same nature in
Greece, 12 or 15 leagues from Lepanto, we
have an enumeration of all the known lakes in
Asia that belong to this species. In Europe,
there is not a single one of any consideration.
There are several small lakes of this kind in
Africa, as those which receive the rivers Ghir,
Zez, Touguedout, and Tafilet. These four
lakes lie at no great distance from one another,
and are situated on the frontiers of Barbary,
near the desart of Zaara. There is another in
the province of Kovar, which receives the river
that runs through the country of Berdoa. In
<PB N="331" REF="366"/>
North America, which abounds with lakes, there
are none of this kind, excepting two small col∣lections
of water formed by brooks, the one
near Guatimapo, and the other some leagues
from Realnuevo, both in Mexico. But in Peru
there are two contiguous lakes, one of which,
Lake Titicaca, is very large, and receives a river
which rises near Cusco; but no river issues from
it. There is a small one in Tucuman, which
receives the river Salta; another, in the same
country, of greater extent, receives the Santiago;
and three or four between Tucuman and
Chili.</P>
<P>These lakes, which neither receive nor give
rise to any river, are more numerous than the
kind just mentioned. They are a kind of
swamps, which collect the rain water; or, they
may originate from subterraneous waters, which
issue in the form of springs in low grounds,
from which there is no fall to carry them off.
Those rivers that overflow may also leave stag∣nating
waters upon the land, which remain a
considerable time, and are occasionally recruited
by subsequent inundations. Salt lakes may
sometimes be produced by inundations from the
sea, as that at Harlem, and several others, in
Holland, to which no other origin can be ascri∣bed.
The sea, likewise, by abandoning certain
lands, may have left lakes in the low grounds
of particular countries, and which continue to
be maintained by the rains. Of this kind, there
<PB N="332" REF="367"/>
are small lakes in Europe, as in Ireland, in Jut∣land,
in Italy, in the country of the Grisons,
in Poland, in Muscovy, in Finland, and in
Greece: But all these are of little consideration.
In Asia, near the Euphrates, in the desart of Irac,
there is one above 15 leagues long; another in
Persia, nearly of the same extent, upon which
are situated the towns of Kelat, Tetuan, Vastan,
and Van; a small one in Chorazan, near Fer∣rior;
another in Independent Tartary, called
<HI>Lake Levi</HI>; two in Muscovite Tartary; one in
Cochinchina; and, in sine, a pretty large one
not far from Nankin. This last, however,
Communicates with the neighbouring sea by a
canal of considerable extent. In Africa, there
is a small lake of this species in the kingdom of
Morocco; another near Alexandria, which ap∣pears
to have been left by the sea; another, 8
or 10 leagues long, formed by the rain-water,
in the desart of Azarad, about the 30th degree
of latitude; another, still larger, upon which is
situated the town of Gaoga, under the 27th de∣gree;
another, but much smaller, near the town
of Kanum, under the 30th degree; one near the
mouth of the river Gambia; several others in
Congo, about the 2d or 3d degree of south lati∣tude;
two others in the country of the Caffres;
one of them, called <HI>Lake Rusumbo,</HI> is not very
extensive; and the other, which lies in the pro∣vince
of Arbuta, is perhaps the largest of this
kind, being about 25 leagues long, and 7 or
<PB N="333" REF="368"/>
8 broad: There is likewise one of these lakes
near the east coast of Madagascar, about the
29th degree of south latitude.</P>
<P>In America, there is one of these lakes situa∣ted
in the middle of the peninsula of Florida,
which has an island called <HI>Serrope</HI> in its centre.
The lake near the town of Mexico, which is
round, and about 10 leagues in diameter, belongs
likewise to this species. There is another still
more extensive in New Spain, about 25 leagues
from the eastern coast of the bay of Campeachy;
and another, of smaller dimensions, in the same
country, near the coast of the South Sea. Some
travellers have affirmed, that, in the interior
parts of Guiana, there is a very large lake of
this species, which they call <HI>Golden Lake,</HI> or
<HI>Lake Parima</HI>; and they have given marvellous
accounts of the riches of the neighbouring coun∣try,
and of the great quantities of gold dust
found in this lake, which they alledge to be
more than 400 leagues in length, and above
125 in breadth; no river, it is said, either en∣ters
into, or issues from it. Though this lake
be laid down in several maps, its existence is
still problematical.</P>
<P>But the most common and the most extensive
lakes are those which both receive and give rise
to rivers: As they are exceedingly numerous, I
shall only mention the largest, or the most re∣markable,
of them. Beginning with Europe,
we have, in Switzerland, the Lake of Geneva,
<PB N="334" REF="369"/>
that of Constance, &amp;c. In Hungary, Lake Ba∣laton,
and another, of equal extent, in Livonia,
which separates this province from Russia; Lake
Lapwert in Finland, which is very long, and
divides into several branches, and Lake Oula,
which is of a circular figure: In Muscovy, Lake
Ladoga, which is more than 25 leagues long,
and above 12 broad; Lake Onega, which is e∣qually
long, but less in breadth; Lake Ilmen;
Lake Belozero, which is one of the sources of the
Wolga; Lake Iwan-Osero, which is one of the
sources of the Don; and two other lakes, from
which the river Vitzogda derives its origin: In
Lapland, the lake from which issues the river
Kimi; another much larger, and situated near
the coast of Wardhus; and several others of
less note, which give rise to the rivers Lula,
Pitha, and Uma: In Norway, two lakes nearly
of the same dimensions with those of Lapland:
In Sweden, Lake Vener, which is as large as
Lake Meller, upon which Stockholm is situated;
and two less considerable, one near Elvedal, and
the other near Lincopin.</P>
<P>In Siberia and in Muscovite and Independent
Tartary, there are a great number of these lakes,
of which the principal are, the great lake Bara∣ba,
which is more than 100 leagues long, and
of which the waters fall into the Irtis; the great
lake Estraguel the source of the Irtis; several
lesser ones, the sources of the Jenisca; the great
lake Kita, the source of the Oby; another great
<PB N="335" REF="370"/>
lake, the source of the Angara; Lake Baical,
which is more than 70 leagues long, and is
formed by the river Angara; and Lake Pehu,
the source of the Urack, &amp;c. In China and
Chinese Tartary, we have Lake Dalai, the source
of the great river Argus, which falls into the
Amour; the lake of the Three Mountains, the
source of the river Helum, which falls likewise
into the Amour; the lakes of Cinhal, Cokmor,
and Sorama, the sources of the river Hoamho;
two large lakes in the neighbourhood of Nankin,
&amp;c. In Tonquin is the Guadag, a lake of con∣siderable
magnitude. In India, we have Lake
Chiamat, which is the source of the river La∣quia,
and lies near the sources of the Ava, the
Longenu, &amp;c. This lake is more than 50 leagues
long, and about 40 broad. The source of the
Ganges is another lake; and one near Cash∣mire
gives rise to the Indus, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In Africa there are Lake Cayar, and two or
three others, near the mouth of the Senegal;
Lake Guarda, and Lake Sigismus, which, toge∣ther,
make a triangular lake of 100 leagues long,
and 75 broad, and contain a considerable island.
It is in this lake that the Niger loses its name,
and, at its exit, assumes that of <HI>Senegal.</HI> In a∣scending
towards the course of this river, we
meet with another pretty large lake called <HI>Bour∣nou,</HI>
where the Niger again changes its name;
for the river that falls into this lake is called
<HI>Gombaru.</HI> At the sources of the Nile in Aethio∣pia,
<PB N="336" REF="371"/>
is the great lake Gambia, which is above
50 leagues long. On the coast of Guiney are
also several lakes, which appear to have been o∣riginally
formed by the sea; and there are few
others in Africa of any consideration.</P>
<P>North America is the country of lakes. The
most extensive of them are, Lake Superior, which
is about 125 leagues long, and 50 broad; Lake
Huron, which is near 100 leagues in length, and
about 40 in breadth; Lake Illionois, which,
comprehending the bay of Puants, is nearly as
extensive as Lake Huron; Lake Erie and Lake
Ontario, which together, exceed 80 leagues in
length, by 20 or 25 in breadth; Lake Mistasin,
to the north of Quebec, is about 50 leagues long;
Lake Champlain, to the south of Quebec, is
nearly of equal length; Lake Alemipigon, and
Lake Christinaux, both to the north of Lake
Superior, are likewise considerable; the Lake of
the Assmiboils contains several islands, and is
more than 75 leagues long: Besides the Mexi∣con
Gulf, there are two considerable lakes in
that country; that called Nicaragua, in the pro∣vince
of the same name, is about 70 leagues in
length.</P>
<P>Lastly, in South America, there is a small
lake, the source of the Maragnon; a more ex∣tensive
one gives rise to the river Paraguay:
There are, besides Lake Titicares, the waters of
which fall into the river Plata; two lesser ones,
which discharge their waters into the same ri∣ver;
<PB N="337" REF="372"/>
and some inconsiderable ones in the inte∣rior
parts of Chili.</P>
<P>All lakes that give rise to rivers, and all those
which occur in the course of rivers, or which
border upon and discharge their waters into ri∣vers,
are not salt. Almost all those, on the con∣trary,
which receive rivers, but give rise to none,
are salt. This circumstance seems to favour the
opinion, that the saltness of the sea is occasioned
by the salts brought down from the land by the
rivers; for we find salt does not evaporate; and,
of course, all that is transported by the rivers
remains in the sea: Although the water of ri∣vers
appears to be fresh, it is well known, that
it contains a small quantity of salt, which, in the
course of ages, might accumulate to such a de∣gree
as would be sufficient to produce the pre∣sent
saltness of the sea, and which must be con∣tinually
augmenting. It is in this manner, I
presume, the Caspian, Lake Aral, and the Black
Sea, have become salt. With regard to those
seas, which, like marshes, or swamps, neither
receive nor discharge rivers, they are either salt
or fresh, according to their origin. Those in
the neighbourhood of the sea are commonly
salt; and those at a distance from it are fresh;
because the former have originated from an in∣undations
of the sea, and the latter from fresh
fountains.</P>
<P>The waters of the Dead Sea contain a great deal
of the bitumen of Judea, which is nothing but
<PB N="338" REF="373"/>
asphaltes; and, accordingly, this sea is often
termed the <HI>Asphaltic Lake.</HI> The neighbouring
land is impregnated with this bitumen: And
many have imagined, like the Lake Avernus,
no fish could live in it, and that birds were suf∣focated
in attempting to fly over it. But such
dismal effects are produced by neither of these
lakes; for both of them contain fishes, the birds
fly over them in safety, and men bathe in them
with impunity.</P>
<P>It is said, that, in Bohemia, there is a lake,
which has holes in it so deep, that they cannot
be sounded, and that, from these holes, there
issue violent winds which sweep over all Bohe∣mia,
and, in winter, raise into the air masses of
ice of more than 100 pounds weight<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Act. Leips. anno 1682, p. 246.</NOTE>. We
are likewise told of a petrifying lake in Iceland;
and Lake Neagh in Ireland possesses the same
quality. But these petrifications are, doubtless,
nothing but incrustations similar to those pro∣duced
by the waters at Arcueil.</P>

<HEAD>PROOFS

<HEAD>ARTICLE XII.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the Tides.</HEAD>
<P>WATER, like other fluids, naturally de∣scends
from the higher to the lower
grounds, if not prevented by some interposed
obstacle; and, after it has occupied the lowest
situation, it remains smooth and tranquil, unless
disturbed by some foreign cause. All the wa∣ters
of the ocean are collected in the lowest pla∣ces
upon the surface of the earth; and hence
the motions of the sea must proceed from causes
that are external. The chief motion is that of
the tides, which rise and fall alternately, and
from which results a general and perpetual mo∣tion,
in all seas, from east to west. These two
motions have an invariable relation to the mo∣tions
<PB N="340" REF="375"/>
of the moon. During the full and new
moons, this motion from east to west is most re∣markable,
as well as that of the tides, which ebb
and slow, upon most coasts, every 6½ hours: It
is always high tide when the moon arrives at
the meridian, either above or below the horizon
of the place; and it is always ebb or low tide
when the moon is at the greatest distance from
the meridian, or when it rises and sets. The
motion from east to west is perpetual; because,
when the tide is rising, the whole ocean moves
from east to west, and pushes westward an im∣mense
body of water; and the ebbing, or reflux,
appears only to be owing to the smaller quan∣tity
of water which is then impelled towards
the west. The flux, therefore, ought rather to
be regarded as a swelling, and the reflux as the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the waters, which, in place of di∣sturbing
the motion from east to west, is the
cause which produces and renders it perpetual;
though this motion, for the reason already men∣tioned,
is greater during the flux than the re∣flux.</P>
<P>This motion is attended with the following
circumstances: 1<HI>st,</HI> It is more sensible at the full
and new moon than at the quadratures; it is
likewise more violent in spring and autumn than
in any other season; and it is weakest at the fol∣stices.
This phaenomenon in occasioned by the
combined attractions of the moon and sun.
2<HI>d,</HI> The direction and quantity of this motion
<PB N="341" REF="376"/>
is often varied by the winds, especially such as
blow constantly from the same quarter. Great
rivers, in like manner, by discharging their wa∣ter
into the sea, produce currents which often
extend several leagues, and are strongest when
the direction of the wind corresponds with the
general motion. Of this an example is afforded
in the Pacific Ocean, where the motion from
east to west is constant, and very perceptible.
3<HI>d,</HI> It is worthy of remark, that, when one part
of a fluid is moved, the motion is communicated
to the whole: During the tides, therefore, a
great part of the ocean is sensibly put in mo∣tion;
and, consequently, the whole ocean, from
surface to bottom, is moved at the same time.</P>
<P>To render this more clear, let us attend to the
causes which produce the tides. We formerly
remarked, that the moon acted upon the earth
by a force which some call attraction, and others
gravity. This force penetrates the whole globe,
is exactly proportioned to the quantity of mat∣ter,
and decreases as the squares of the distances
increase. Let us next examine what effects
this force must produce upon the waters when
the moon comes to the meridian of any place.
The surface of the water immediately under the
moon is then nearer that planet than any other
part of the earth; of course, that part of the sea
must be elevated towards the moon, and the
summit of this eminence must be opposite to the
moon's center. To produce this eminence, the
<PB N="342" REF="377"/>
waters upon the surface, as well as those at the
bottom, contribute their share, in proportion to
their distances from the moon, which acts upon
them in the inverse ratio of the squares of their
distances. Thus the surface of this part of the
sea is first elevated; the surface of the adjacent
parts is likewise elevated, but in a smaller de∣gree;
and the waters at the bottom of all these
parts are raised by the same cause. Hence, as
the whole portion of water under the moon is
raised, the waters at a distance, upon which no
attraction is exerted, must necessarily rush for∣ward
with precipitation to supply the place of
those which were elevated, or drawn towards
the moon. It is in this manner that the flux,
or high tide, is produced, which is more or less
sensible on different coasts, and which agitates
the sea, not only at the surface, but at the great∣est
depths. The reflux, or ebb, is a consequence
of the natural disposition of the water, which,
when no longer acted upon by the moon, sub∣sides,
and returns to occupy those shores from
which it had been forced to retire by a foreign
power. The same effect is produced when the
moon arrives at the antipode, or opposite meri∣dian,
but for a different reason: In the first case,
the waters rise, because they are nearer the moon
than any other part of the globe; and, in the se∣cond,
they rise, because the moon is at the greatest
distance from them. It is easy to perceive that the
effect must be the same; for, the waters here be∣ing
<PB N="343" REF="378"/>
less attracted than those of the opposite he∣misphere,
they will necessarily recede, and form
an eminence, the highest point of which will be
where the attraction is least, that is, in the me∣ridian
opposite to the moon's station, or to the
place where she was thirteen hours before.
When the moon comes to the horizon, the tide
is ebb, and the sea is in its natural state of equi∣librium.
But, when she is in the opposite meri∣dian,
this equilibrium cannot exist; for the wa∣ters,
at the place opposite to the moon, being
then at their great distance from her, they are
less attracted than the rest of the globe; and
hence their relative gravity, by which they are
constantly kept in equilibrium, pushes them to∣wards
the point opposite to the moon, in order
to preserve this equilibrium. Thus, in both
cases, when the moon is in the meridian of a
place, or in the opposite meridian, the waters
must be elevated nearly to the same height; and,
consequently, they must ebb or flow back when
the moon is in the horizon, either at her rising
or setting. A motion, such as we have de∣scribed,
necessarily agitates the whole mass of
the ocean, from its surface to its bottom; and,
as the bottom is less affected by winds than the
surface, the motion produced in the former, by
the tides, is more regular and uniform.</P>
<P>From this alternate ebbing and flowing, there
results, as already remarked, a constant motion
of the sea from east to west; for the moon,
<PB N="344" REF="379"/>
which is the cause of the tides, moves from east
to west, and, by acting successively in this di∣rection,
she draws the waters after her. This
motion is most perceptible in straits. At the
straits of Magellan, for example, the tides rise
near 20 feet, and they continue at this height
six hours; but the reflux, or ebbing, lasts only
two hours, and the waters run to the west<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Narborough's voyages.</NOTE>.
This incontestibly proves, that the reflux is not
equal to the flux, and that, from both, there re∣sults
a motion to the west, which is stronger du∣ring
the flux than the reflux. It is for this rea∣son,
that, in open seas, at great distances from
land, the tides are only rendered perceptible by
this general current of the waters from east to
west.</P>
<P>The tides are much higher between the tro∣pics
than in any other part of the ocean. They
likewise rise higher in places that stretch from
east to west, in long and narrow bays, and upon
coasts which are interrupted with islands and
promontories. The highest known tides take
place at one of the mouths of the Indus, where
they rise 30 feet perpendicular. They have al∣so
a remarkable elevation at Malaya, in the
straits of the Sund, in the Red Sea, in Nelson's
bay, at the mouth of the river St Laurence, up∣on
the coasts of China and Japan, at Panama, in
the gulf of Bengal, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="380"/>
The sea's motion, from east to west, is most
observable in particular places. Voyagers have
often remarked it in sailing from India to Ma∣dagascar
and Africa. It moves also with consi∣derable
force in the Pacific ocean, and between
the Moluccas and Brazil: But it is most violent
in straits: The waters are carried from east to
west, through the straits of Magellan, for ex∣ample,
with such rapidity, that their motion is
perceptible, at a great distance, in the Atlantic
ocean. It was this circumstance, it is said, that
made Magellan conjecture that a strait existed
by which there was a communication with the
two seas. In the straits formed by the Manillas,
in the channels between the Maldiva islands, and
in the gulf of Mexico, between Cuba and Juca∣tan,
there is a constant current from east to west.
This motion, in the gulf of Paria, is so violent,
that its strait is called the <HI>Dragon's Mouth.</HI> It
is likewise violent in the sea of Canada, in that
of Tartary, and in Waigait's straits, through
which it forces enormous masses of ice into the
northern seas. The Pacific ocean runs from east
to west through the straits of Japan; the sea of
Japan runs towards China; and the Indian
ocean runs westward through the straits of Java,
and other islands of India. It is, therefore, evi∣dent,
that the sea has a general and uniform
motion from east to west; and, it is certain, that
the Atlantic runs towards America, and that the
<PB N="346" REF="381"/>
Pacific ocean flies from it, as is apparent at Cape
Current between Lima and Panama<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Varen. Geog. p. 119.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In fine, the tides rise and fall alternately in
six hours and a half upon most coasts, though
they happen at different hours, according to the
climate, and the position of particular lands.
Thus the coasts of the sea are perpetually beat
by the waves; and each tide carries off from the
higher grounds small quantities of matter, and
deposites them, at a distance, on the bottom of
the ocean. In the same manner, each tide car∣ries
in, and deposites upon low coasts, sand,
shells, and other sea-bodies, which gradually
form horizontal strata, and give rise to downs,
and little hills, similar to other hills, both in
their figure and internal structure. Thus the
sea is constantly encroaching upon high coasts,
and losing ground upon those that are low.</P>
<P>To give an idea of the violent effects of a
stormy sea against a high coast, I shall relate a
fact attested by an eye-witness, a person worthy
of the highest credit. In the largest of the Ork∣ney
islands, there are coasts composed of solid
rock, above 200 feet high, and nearly perpendi∣cular
to the surface of the water. The tides, as
is usual in islands and promontories, rise very
high at this place. But, when a violent wind
concurs with the flow of the tide, the agitation
of the waters is so great, that they often rise a∣bove
these rocks, and fall down in the form of
<PB N="347" REF="382"/>
rain: Nay, to this amazing height, gravel, and
stones as large as a man's fist, are raised from
the foot of the rocks.</P>
<P>I myself saw, in the port of Livourne, where
the sea is much more tranquil, a tempest in De∣cember
1731, which obliged the mariners to cut
off the masts of their vessels, which were driven,
by the violence of the wind, from their anchors
in the road: The waters of the sea sur∣mounted
fortifications of a great height; and,
as I was upon one of the most advanced works,
before I could reach the town, I was more
drenched with sea-water than I could have been
by the heaviest rain.</P>
<P>These examples may convey a notion of the
violence with which the sea acts against particu∣lar
coasts. This constant agitation gradually
wears<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We are told by Shaw, in his travels, that, in many parts on the coast of Syria and Phoenicia, the rocks had been cut, by the antients, into troughs of two or three yards long, and broad in proportion, for the purpose of making salt by evapo∣ration. But, notwithstanding the hardness of the rocks, these troughs are now almost totally obliterated by the agitation of the waves.</NOTE>, corrodes, excavates, and diminishes the
quantity of the land. All these materials are trans∣ported
and deposited in places where the sea is
more tranquil. In the time of storms, the water is
foul and muddy, by the admixture of matters
detached from the coasts and from the bottom
of the sea. These bodies, which are very vari∣ous,
and carried from great distances, are thrown
<PB N="348" REF="383"/>
upon the low shores, especially after tempests,
as ambergris on the west of Ireland, yellow am∣ber
upon the coasts of Pomerania, cocoas upon
the coasts of India, &amp;c. and sometimes pumice,
and other singular stones. On this occasion, we
may quote a passage from the New Voyages to
the islands of America. 'When at St Domingo,'
says the author, 'I was presented, among other
things, with some light stones, brought in by
the sea in high south winds: Some of them
were two and a half feet long, 18 inches broad,
and about a foot thick; and yet they weighed
not above five pounds. They were as white
as snow, harder than pumice, of a fine grain,
and appeared not to be porous. When, how∣ever,
they were thrown into water, they re∣bounded
like a foot-ball thrown against the
ground. It was difficult to force them under
water with the hand. I inclosed two of these
stones with thin boards, and found that they
bore 160 pounds without sinking. They ser∣ved
my negro for a shallop on which he divert∣ed
himself in failing about the quay<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tom. 1. p. 260.</NOTE>.' This
stone must have been a pumice of a close fine
grain, which had been transported by the sea
from the neighbourhood of some volcano, in the
same manner as ambergris, cocoas, common pu∣mice,
the seeds of plants, reeds, &amp;c. are trans∣ported.
It is chiefly on the coasts of Ireland
and of Scotland that observations of this kind
have been made. The sea, by its general mo∣tion
<PB N="349" REF="384"/>
from east to west, ought to carry to Ameri∣ca
the productions of our coasts; and, it must
be by the operation of some irregular move∣ments,
that the productions of the East and West
Indias, and of the northern regions, are brought
upon our coasts. The winds are probably the
cause of those effects. In open seas, and at great
distances from land, large portions of the water
have been seen totally covered with pumice∣stones.
They could only come from volcano's
in islands, or on the continent; and they have
probably been transported to the open seas by
currents. Before the south part of America was
discovered, and when it was not believed that
the Indian ocean had any communication with
ours, appearances of this kind first gave rise to
the suspicion that such a communication was not
impossible.</P>
<P>The alternate motion of the tides, and the
uniform motion of the sea from east to west,
exhibit different appearances in different climates,
according to the different indentations in the
land, and the height of the coasts. In some
places the motion from east to west is not per∣ceptible;
at others, it moves in a contrary direc∣tion,
as on the coast of Guiney. But these con∣trary
motions are occasioned by the winds, by
the position of the land, by the waters of great
rivers, and by the disposition of the bottom of
the sea. All these causes produce currents,
which often change the direction of the general
<PB N="350" REF="385"/>
movement. But, as this motion from east to
west is the greatest, most general, and constant,
it ought to produce the most signal effects; and,
upon the whole, the sea must gradually gain
ground on the west, and lose it on the east; and,
although, upon coasts where the west wind blows
during the greatest part of the year, as in France
and Britain, the sea may gain land on the east;
yet these exceptions destroy not the effect of the
general cause.</P>

<HEAD>ARTICLE XIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of Inequalities in the Bottom of the Sea, and of
Currents.</HEAD>
<P>THE coasts of the sea may be divided
into three kinds: 1. High coasts com∣posed
of hard rocks, commonly perpendicular,
and of a considerable elevation, rising some∣times
to the height of 700 or 800 feet. 2.
Low coasts, of which some are almost level with
the surface of the water, and others have a small
elevation, and are often bordered with rocks
nearly of a level with the water, which give
rise to breakers, and render the approach of ships
exceedingly dangerous. 3. Downs, or coasts
formed by sand, either accumulated by the sea,
or brought down and deposited by rivers: These
<PB N="352" REF="387"/>
downs form hills of more or less elevation, ac∣cording
to circumstances.</P>
<P>The coasts of Italy are lined with marble and
rocks of different species. Those rocks ap∣pear
at a distance like perpendicular pillars of
marble. The coasts of France, from Brest to
Bourdeaux, consist almost entirely of rocks on
a level with the sea, which occasion breakers.
The coasts of England, of Spain, and of many
other places, are bordered with rocks and hard
stones, excepting particular spots which are em∣ployed
as roads and harbours.</P>
<P>The depth of the water along the coasts is
generally proportioned to their elevation; a high
coast indicates a deep water; and, on low coasts,
the water is commonly shallow. The inequa∣lities
at the bottom of the sea near the coasts
likewise correspond with the inequalities in the
surface of the ground along the shore. This
subject is illustrated in the following manner by
a celebrated voyager.</P>
<P>'I have made it my general observation, that,
where the land is fenced with steep rocks and
cliffs against the sea, there the sea is very deep,
and seldom affords anchor-ground; and, on
the other side, where the land falls away with
a declivity into the sea, (although the land be
extraordinary high within,) yet there are com∣monly
good soundings, and consequently an∣choring;
and, as the visible declivity of the
land appears near, or at the edge of the water,
<PB N="353" REF="388"/>
whether pretty steep, or more sloping, so we
commonly find our anchor-ground to be more
or less deep or steep; therefore we come near∣er
the shore, or anchor farther off, as we see
convenient; for there is no coast in the world,
that I know, or have heard of, where the land
is of a continual height, without some small
vallies or declivities, which lie intermixed with
the high land. They are the subsiding of val∣lies
or low lands, that make dents in the shore
and creeks, small bays, and harbours, or little
coves, &amp;c. which afford good anchoring, the
surface of the earth being there lodged deep
under water. Thus we find many good har∣bours
on such coasts, where the land bounds
the sea with steep cliffs, by reason of the de∣clivities,
or subsiding of the land between these
cliffs: But, where the declension from the hills
or cliffs is not within land, between hill and
hill, but, as on the coast of Chili and Peru, the
declivity is toward the main sea, or into it, the
coast being perpendicular, or very steep from
the neighbouring hills, as in those countries
from the Andes, that run along the shore,
there is a deep sea, and few or no harbours or
creeks. All that coast is too steep for anchor∣ing,
and hath the fewest roads fit for ships
of any coast I know. The coasts of Gallicia,
Portugal, Norway, and Newfoundland, &amp;c.
are coasts like the Peruvian, and the high
islands of the Archipelago; but yet not so
<PB N="354" REF="389"/>
scanty of good harbours; for, where there are
short ridges of land, there are good bays at
the extremities of those ridges, where they
plunge into the sea; as on the coast of Ca∣raccos,
&amp;c. The island of John Ferdinando,
and the island of St Helena, &amp;c. are such high
land with deep shore: And, in general, the
plunging of any land under water, seems to
be in proportion to the rising of its continuous
part above water, more or less steep; and it
must be a bottom almost level, or very gently
declining, that affords good anchoring, ships
being soon driven from their moorings on a
steep bank; therefore, we never strive to anchor
where we see the land high, and bounding the
sea with steep cliffs; and, for this reason, when
we came in sight of States-Island, near Terra
del Fuego, before we entered into the South-Seas,
we did not so much as think of anchor∣ing
after we saw what land it was, because of
the steep cliffs which appeared against the sea;
yet there might be little harbours or coves for
shallops, or the like, to anchor in, which we
did not see, or search after.'</P>
<P>'As high steep cliffs bounding on the sea
have this ill consequence, that they seldom af∣ford
anchoring; so they have this benefit, that
we can see them far off, and fail close to them,
without danger; for which reason we call
them bold shores; whereas low land, on the
contrary, is seen but a little way, and in many
<PB N="355" REF="390"/>
places we dare not come near it, for fear of
running a-ground before we see it. Besides,
there are, in many places, shoals thrown out
by the course of great rivers, that from the
low land fall into the sea.'</P>
<P>'This which I have said, that there is usually
good anchoring near low lands, may be illu∣strated
by several instances. Thus, on the
south side of the bay of Campeachy, there is
mostly low land, and there also is good an∣choring
all along shore; and, in some places
to the eastward of the town of Campeachy,
we shall have so many fathom as we are leagues
off from land; that is, from 9 or 10 leagues
distance, till you come within 4 leagues; and
from thence to land it grows but shallower.
The bay of Honduras also is low land, and con∣tinues
mostly so, as we passed along from thence
to the coasts of Portobel, and Cartagena, till
we came as high as Santa Martha; afterwards
the land is low again, till you come towards
the coast of Caraccos, which is a high coast
and bold shore. The land about Surinam, on
the same coast, is low and good anchoring, and
that over on the coast of Guinea is such also.
And such, too, is the bay of Panama, where
the pilot-book orders the pilot always to sound,
and not to come within such a depth, be it by
night or day. In the same seas, from the high
land of Guatimala in Mexico, to California,
there is mostly low land and good anchoring.
<PB N="356" REF="391"/>
In the main of Asia, the coast of China, the
bay of Siam and Bengal, and all the coast of
Coromandel, and the coast about Malacca, and
against it the island of Sumatra, on that side,
are mostly low anchoring shores. But, on the
west side of Sumatra, the shore is high and
bold; so most of the islands lying to the
eastward of Sumatra; as the islands Borneo,
Celebes, Gilolo, and abundance of islands of
less note, lying scattering up and down those
seas, are low land, and have good anchoring
about them; with many shoals scattered to and
fro among them; but the islands lying against the
East-Indian Ocean, especially the west sides of
them, are high land and steep, particularly the
west parts, not only of Sumatra, but also of
Java, Timor, &amp;c. Particulars are endless;
but, in general, 'tis seldom but high shores and
deep waters, and, on the other side, low land
and shallow seas are found together<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dampier's Voyages, vol. 1. p. 422. 423. 424. 425.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>It is, therefore, fully established by the obser∣vations
of navigators, that there are, in the bot∣tom
of the sea, considerable mountains, and o∣ther
inequalities. We are also assured by the
testimony of divers, that there are smaller ine∣qualities
occasioned by rocks, and that the cold
is greatest in the hollows or valleys. In general,
as formerly remarked, the depths of open seas
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in proportion to their distance from
the coasts. It appears, from M. Buache's
chart of that part of the ocean which lies be∣tween
<PB N="357" REF="392"/>
the coasts of Africa and America, and
from the draughts he has given us of the sea
from Cape Tagrin to Rio-grand, that the bot∣tom
of the ocean is as irregular as the surface
of the land; that Abrolhos, where there are
<HI>vigies,</HI> and where some of the rocks are on a
level with the water, are only the tops of large
and high mountains, of which Dolphin island
is one of the most elevated points; that the Cape
de Verd islands are likewise the tops of moun∣tains;
and that all round these abrolhos and
islands, the depth of the sea is unfathomable.</P>
<P>With regard to the qualities of the different
soils at the bottom of the sea, little can be said
with precision, as all our knowledge is derived
from sounding and from divers. We on∣ly
know, that some places are covered with
slime and mud of a considerable thickness, in
which anchors can have no hold: It is proba∣ble
that, in these places, the mud is deposited by
rivers. Other parts are covered with sand of
different kinds, similar to those upon land. In
others are heaps of shells, madrepores, corals,
and other productions of insects, just beginning
to unite and to assume the form of stones: In
others, we find fragments of stones, gravel, and
frequently stones and marbles compleatly from∣ed.
In the Maldiva islands, for example, they
build their houses with a hard stone raised from
some fathoms under water. At Marseilles very
good marble is raised from the bottom of the
<PB N="358" REF="393"/>
sea, which is so far from wasting or destroying
stones and marble, that, as shall be proved in
our discourse on minerals, it creates and preserves
them: It is the sun, the earth, the air, and the
rains, which alone corrupt and destroy these
substances.</P>
<P>The bottom of the sea must be composed of
the same materials as the surface of the earth
which we inhabit, since the very same substan∣ces
are found on both. At the bottom of some
parts of the ocean are vast collections of shells,
madrepores, and corals; and we find, upon
land, numberless quarries, banks of chalk, and
of other substances, mixed with the same shells,
madrepores, and corals; so that, in every view,
the dry parts of this globe resemble those cover∣ed
with the waters, both in composition of ma∣terials,
and in superficial inequalities.</P>
<P>To these inequalities at the bottom, we must
ascribe the origin of currents; for, if the bot∣tom
were uniform and level, there could be no
current but the general motion from east to
west, and such as might occasionally be produ∣ced
by the winds. But what incontestibly
proves, that most currents are produced by the
tides, and take their direction from inequalities
at the bottom, is, that they uniformly follow
the tides, and change their course at every ebb
and flow<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Pietro della Valle on the currents in the Gulf of Cam∣baia, vol. 6. p. 363.</NOTE>. This is confirmed by the testimony
<PB N="359" REF="394"/>
of all navigators, who unanimously affirm, that,
in those places where the tides are most impetu∣ous,
the currents are likewise most rapid.</P>
<P>Thus it is apparent, that the tides give rise to
currents, and that they always follow the di∣rection
of the opposite hills or mountains be∣tween
which they run. Currents produced by
winds likewise observe the direction of the emi∣nences
concealed under the waters; for they
seldom run in the direct path of the winds; nei∣ther
do those produced by the tides invariably
observe the course pointed out by their original
cause.</P>
<P>To give a distinct idea of the origin of cur∣rents,
let it be remarked, that they take place in
all seas; that some are rapid, and others
slow; that some are of great extent both in
length and breadth, and others shorter and nar∣rower;
that the same cause by which they are
produced, whether it be the wind or the tides,
frequently bestows on each a difference both in
celerity and direction; that a north wind, for
example, which ought to produce a general mo∣tion
towards the south, gives rise, on the con∣trary,
to a number of separate currents, very
different both in their direction and extent, some
running south, others south-east, and others
south-west; some are rapid, others slow; some
long and broad, and others short and narrow:
In a word, their motions are so various and
combined, that they lose all resemblance to their
<PB N="360" REF="395"/>
general cause. When a contrary wind blows,
every motion is uniformly reversed; and the
course of the different currents is precisely the
same as would necessarily take place between
two opposite and neighbouring hills upon the
surface of the land, were it covered with water.
Of this, the Maldiva and Indian islands, where
the winds blow and the currents run regularly
for six months in opposite directions, afford most
striking examples. The same thing has been
remarked of currents between shoals and sand∣banks.
In general, all currents, from whatever
cause they proceed, have the same dimensions
and the same direction through their whole
course; but they differ greatly from each other
in every respect. This uniformity and variety
can proceed from no other cause but the ine∣qualities
of the hills, mountains, and vallies, at
the bottom of the ocean; for, it is an establish∣ed
fact, that the current between two islands
follows the direction of the coasts; and the
same phaenomenon is exhibited between shoals
and sand-banks. The hills and mountains in
the sea, therefore, may be considered as the
banks which contain and direct the currents:
Hence a current is a river, the breadth of which
is determined by that of the valley through
which it runs; its rapidity is proportioned to
the force by which it is produced, combined
with the breadth of the interval through which
it passes; and its direction is marked out by the
<PB N="361" REF="396"/>
position of the hills and other inequalities be∣tween
which it shapes its course.</P>
<P>An opportunity is now afforded us of ex∣plaining
that singular correspondence between
the angles of hills and mountains, which is ob∣servable
in every country of the world. We
have already remarked this uniform correspon∣dence
of angles in the banks of rivers. The
cause of this effect depends on the laws of hy∣drostatics,
and might be easily explained. But
it is sufficient for our present purpose, that the
fact is general, and universally known; and
every man may satisfy himself with his own
eyes, that, when the bank of a river projects in∣to
the land, to the left, for instance, the oppo∣site
bank, on the contrary, makes a projection
from the land on the right.</P>
<P>The currents of the ocean, therefore, which
ought to be regarded as large rivers, and as sub∣ject
to the same laws as those on land, must,
like them, have formed, through the whole ex∣tent
of their course, many sinuosities or wind∣ings
with corresponding angles or projections:
And, as the banks of currents are hills and
mountains, either above or below the surface of
the water, they must have produced on these
eminences the same effects as our rivers do up∣on
their banks. Thus, we have no longer any
reason to be astonished, that our hills and
mountains, which were formerly covered with
<PB N="362" REF="397"/>
the sea, and formed by the sediments of its wa∣ters,
should have assumed, by the motion of its
currents, this regular figure, arising from the
correspondence of their opposite angles. They
were originally banks of currents, or of sea-ri∣vers,
and necessarily must have assumed a figure
and direction similar to those of land-rivers.</P>
<P>This alone, independent of the other proofs
which we have adduced, is a sufficient demon∣stration
that all our present continents and
islands were formerly covered with the waters
of the ocean, and throws much light on the
theory which I have been endeavouring to esta∣blish.
It was not enough to have proved that
the internal strata of the earth were formed by
sediments of the waters; that the mountains
were elevated by successive accumulations of these
sediments; or, that many strata were impreg∣nated
with shells and other productions of the
sea. It was still necessary to investigate and
assign the real cause of the correspondence in
the angles of mountains, which hitherto had
never been attempted, but which, when united
with the other proofs, forms a connected chain
of evidence in support of my theory, as com∣pleat
as the nature of physical reasoning will
admit.</P>
<P>The most conspicuous currents of the ocean
are those in the Atlantic near the coast of Gui∣ney.
They extend from Cape Verd to the bay
of Fernandopo. They run from west to east,
<PB N="363" REF="398"/>
which is contrary to the general motion of the
sea; and they are so rapid, that vessels sail in
two days from Moura to Rio de Benin, about
150 leagues, but require six or seven weeks to
return. It would even be impossible to clear
these latitudes, were it not by means of the tem∣pestuous
winds which suddenly arise in them:
But there are sometimes whole seasons in which
the mariner is obliged to remain stationary, on
account of perpetual calms, the sea having here
no motion but what it derives from the currents;
and these always run in upon the coasts, from
which they extend not above 20 leagues. Near
the island of Sumatra, there are rapid currents,
which run from south to north, and which have
probably given rise to the bay between Malacca
and India. We find similar currents between
Java and the lands of Magellan, and between
the Cape of Good Hope and Madagascar, espe∣cially
on the African coast from Natal to the
Cape. In the Pacific ocean, upon the coasts of
Peru, and the rest of America, the waters move
from south to north, which is probably owing
to the constant blowing of the south wind. The
same motion from south to north has been re∣marked
on the coasts of Brasil, from Cape St
Augustine to the Antilles, and from the mouth
of the Manilla straits to the Philippines and
Japan<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Varen. Geogr. p. 140.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="364" REF="399"/>
There are violent currents in the neighbour∣hood
of the Maldiva islands; and between these
islands, as already observed, the currents run al∣ternately
in opposite directions six months in the
year, and are probably occasioned by the trade∣winds.</P>
<P>We only here enumerate such currents as are
remarkable both for their extent and their rapi∣dity;
because the number of lesser currents is
almost infinite. The tides, the winds, and every
cause that agitates the waters, produce currents,
which are more or less perceptible in different
places. We have already remarked, that the
bottom of the sea is, like the land, intersected
with mountains and vallies, shoals and sand∣banks.
In all the mountainous places, the cur∣rents
must necessarily be violent; and, where
the bottom is smooth and level, they are almost
imperceptible; for the rapidity of a current must
augment in proportion to the obstacles the water
meets with. The current between two chains
of mountains will be more or less violent in
proportion to their distance. The same thing
must happen between two banks of sand, or two
adjacent islands. It is, accordingly, remarkable,
that, in the Indian ocean, which is intersected
with an innumerable quantity of islands and
sand-banks, there are every where currents,
which, by their rapidity, render navigation ex∣tremely
dangerous.</P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="400"/>
Currents are not only occasioned by inequa∣lities
at the bottom; but a similar effect is pro∣duced
by the coasts, from which the waters are
repelled to greater or less distances. This re∣gorging
of the waters may be rendered perpe∣tual
and violent by particular circumstances: An
oblique position, for example, of a coast, its con∣tiguity
to a bay or a great river, a promontory,
or any particular obstacle to the general move∣ment
of the waters, will always give rise to a
current: Now, as nothing is more irregular than
the bottom and the coasts of the sea, the num∣ber
of currents that every where appear ought
not to create surprise.</P>
<P>All currents have a determinate breadth, pro∣portioned
to the interval between the two emi∣nences
which limit them. They run in the same
manner as land-rivers; they form a channel,
and cut their banks in a regular manner, with
corresponding angles: In fine, the currents of
the ocean have scooped out our valleys, shaped
our mountains, and bestowed upon the land,
while it remained under the surface of the wa∣ters,
the form under which it now appears.</P>
<P>If any doubt should remain concerning the
correspondence in the angles of mountains, I
appeal to the testimony of every man's observa∣tion.
Every traveller may remark this corre∣spondence
in opposite hills. When a hill makes
a projection to the right, the opposite one uni∣formly
recedes to the left. Besides, in opposite
<PB N="366" REF="401"/>
hills separated by vallies, there is rarely any dif∣ference
in their height. The more I observe
the contours and elevations of hills, I am the
more convinced of the correspondence of their
angles, and of their resemblance to the channels
and banks of rivers. It was the repeated obser∣vation
of this surprising regularity and resem∣blance
that first suggested the idea of the theory
of the earth which I am now supporting. When
to this are added the parallelism of the strata,
and the shells so universally incorporated with
different materials, no subject of this nature can
admit of a greater degree of probability.</P>

<HEAD>Of Regular Winds.</HEAD>
<P>IN our climates, nothing can appear to be
more capricious and irregular than the force
and direction of the winds. But there are some
countries where this irregularity is not so great,
and others where the wind blows constantly in
the same direction, and with nearly the same de∣gree
of force.</P>
<P>Though the motions of the air depend on
many causes; yet there are some more con∣stant
and powerful than others; but it is diffi∣cult
to estimate their precise effects, because these
are often modified by secondary causes.</P>
<P><PB N="368" REF="403"/>
The heat of the sun is the most powerful
cause of winds: It produces a considerable and
successive rarefaction in the different parts of
the atmosphere, and gives rise to an east-wind,
which blows constantly between the Tropics,
where the rarefaction is greatest.</P>
<P>The force of the sun's attraction upon the at∣mosphere,
and even that of the moon, are in∣considerable,
when compared with the cause
just mentioned. This force it is true, produces
a motion in the air similar to that of the tides
in the sea: But, though the air is elastic, and
800 times lighter than water, the motion pro∣duced
by attraction cannot exceed what is ex∣cited
in the waters of the ocean by the same
cause; for the action of gravity being propor∣tioned
to the quantity of matter, it must elevate
a sea of water, of air, or of quicksilver, nearly
to the same height. Hence the influence of the
planets upon the air must be inconsiderable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Reflections fur la Cause Generale des Vents, par M. D'Alembert.</NOTE>;
and, though it must occasion a slight motion
from east to west, this motion becomes alto∣gether
insensible when compared with that pro∣duced
by the heat of the sun: But, as the rare∣faction
is always greatest when the sun is in the
zenith, the current of air must follow the course
of the sun, and produce a constant wind from
east to west. This wind blows perpetually at
sea in the Torrid Zone, and at land, in most
<PB N="369" REF="404"/>
places between the Tropics. It is this wind
which we perceive when the sun rises; and, in
general, east winds are more frequent, and more
violent than west winds. The general wind,
from east to west, extends even beyond the
Tropics. It blows so constantly in the Pacific
ocean, that the ships coming from Acapulco to
the Philippines, perform their voyage, which is
more than 2700 leagues, without the least dan∣ger,
and without, almost, the necessity of being
directed. In the Atlantic, between Africa and
Brasil, this wind is equally constant. It is like∣wise
felt between the Philippines and Africa;
but there it is less constant, on account of the
obstacles it meets with from the numerous
islands in that sea; for it blows, during the
months of January, February, March, and April,
between the Mozambique coast and India; but
it gives place to other winds during the rest of
the year: And, though it is less perceptible on
the coasts than on the open sea, and still less in
the interior parts of continents than on the
coasts, yet, in some places, it blows almost per∣petually,
as on the east coasts of Brasil, on the
coasts of Loango in Africa, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This wind is constant under the Line; and,
therefore, in going from Europe to America,
mariners direct their course southward, along
the coasts of Spain and Africa, till they come
within 20 degrees of the Equator, where they
fall in with the east, or trade-wind, which car∣ries
<PB N="370" REF="405"/>
them directly to the coast of America. By
means of the same wind, the voyage from Aca∣pulco
to the Philippines is performed in two
months; but the return from the Philippines
to Acapulco is much more difficult, and requires
a longer time. About 28 or 30 degrees on
this side of the Line, the west wind is equally
constant; and, for this reason, the vessels return∣ing
from the West Indies to Europe, observe
not the same rout as in going out. Those from
New Spain run north along the coast till they
arrive at the Havannah, in the island of Cuba;
and from thence they proceed northward till
they fall in with the west wind, which carries
them to the Azores, and then to Spain. In the
same manner, vessels returning by the South
Sea from the Philippines or China, to Peru or
Mexico, sail north as far as Japan; and, under
that latitude, they sail to within a certain distance
from California; and from thence, following
the coast of New Spain, they arrive at Acapulco.
These east winds blow not always from the same
point; but, in general, they blow from the
south-east from April to September, and from
the north-east from November to April.</P>
<P>The east wind, by its constant action, aug∣ments
the general motion of the sea from east
to west. It also produces perpetual currents,
some of them running from east to west, and
others from east to south-east, or north-west, ac∣cording
to the direction of the eminences, or
<PB N="371" REF="406"/>
chains of mountains, below the surface, the
vallies or intervals between which serving as
channels to these sea-rivers. The variable
winds, which blow sometimes from the east,
and sometimes from the south, likewise produce
currents, which change their direction with that
of the wind.</P>
<P>The winds that blow constantly for some
months are commonly succeeded by contrary
winds, which obliges the mariner to wait for
that which is most favourable to his destination.
When these winds change, they often produce,
for several days, and sometimes for a month, or
even two months, a perfect calm, or dreadful
tempests.</P>
<P>These general winds, occasioned by the ra∣refaction
of the atmosphere, are variously com∣bined
and modified by different causes, and in
different climates. In that part of the Atlantic
which lies under the Temperate Zone, the north
wind blows almost constantly during the months
of October, November, December, and January.
These months, therefore, are most favourable
for ships going to the Indies, which are carried
over the Line by this wind: And it is a well
known fact, that vessels which depart from Eu∣rope
in March, frequently arrive not sooner at
Brasil than those which set out in the following
October. The north wind reigns almost perpe∣tually,
during the winter, off Nova Zembla, and
other northern coasts. At Cape de Verd, the
<PB N="372" REF="407"/>
south wind blows, during the month of July,
which is the rainy season, or winter, in these
climates. At the Cape of Good Hope, the north-west
wind blows during the month of Septem∣ber:
The same wind blows at Patna in the East
Indies, during the months of November, De∣cember
and January, and occasion great rains;
but the east wind prevails during the other nine
months. In the Indian Ocean, between Africa
and India, and as far as the Molucca islands,
the trade-wind from east to west reigns from
January to the beginning of June; the west
winds begin in August or September; and, in
the interval between June and July, there are
dreadful tempests, generally from the north
winds; but these winds are more variable on
the coasts than in the open seas.</P>
<P>In the kingdom of Guzarat, and upon the
neighbouring coasts, the north winds blow from
March to September; and, during the other
months, the south winds almost always prevail.
The Dutch, in returning from Java, set out in
January or February, by the assistance of the
east wind, which is felt as far as the 18th degree
of south latitude; and then they meet with south
winds, which carry them to St Helena<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Varen. Geog. cap. 20.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Some regular winds are produced by the
melting of the snows. This was remarked by
the antient Greeks. During summer, a north-east
wind, and a south-east one during winter,
<PB N="373" REF="408"/>
was observed to take place in Thracia, in Mace∣donia,
in the Egean Sea, and even in Egypt
and Africa; and winds of the same kind have
been remarked in Congo, at Guzarat, and at the
extremity of Africa, which are all occasioned by
the melting of the snows. Regular winds,
which last but a few hours, are also produced by
the motion of the tides; and, in many places, as
on the coasts of New Spain, of Congo, of Cuba,
&amp;c. a wind blows from the land during the
night, and from the sea during the day.</P>
<P>The north winds are equally regular within
the polar circles; but they become more and
more imperceptible as we approach the Equa∣tor:
This remark is applicable to both poles.</P>
<P>In the Atlantic and Aethiopic ocean, within
the tropics, an east wind blows, through the
whole year, without any considerable variation,
excepting in some small spots, where it changes
according to the situation of the coasts, and other
circumstances: 1<HI>st,</HI> Near the coast of Africa, and
about the 28th degree of North latitude, vessels
are certain of finding a fresh gale from the
north-east, or north-north-east, which accom∣panies
them to the 10th degree of the same la∣titude,
about 100 leagues from the coast of
Guinea; and, at the 4th degree of north latitude,
they meet with calms and tornadoes. 2<HI>d,</HI> In
going by the Caribbee islands, this wind turns
more and more easterly, in proportion as the
vessels approach the American coast. 3<HI>d,</HI> The
<PB N="374" REF="409"/>
limits of these variable winds, in the Atlantic,
are more extensive upon the coasts of America
than upon those of Africa. Along the coast of
Guinea, from Sierra Leona to the island of St
Thomas, an extent of about 500 leagues, there
is a perpetual south, or south-west wind. The
narrowest part of the Atlantic is from the coast
of Guinea to Brasil, where it is not above 500
leagues over. Vessels, however, that depart
from Guinea, are obliged to shape their course
southward, especially when they set out in the
months of July or August, in order to fall in
with the south-east winds, which blow constant∣ly
during this season<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Phil. Trans. abridg. vol. 2. p. 129.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the Mediterranean, the east wind blows
from the land in the evening, and the west wind
from the sea in the morning. The south wind,
which is accompanied with rain, and blows
commonly during the latter end of autumn, at
Paris, in Burgundy, and Champagne, yields to a
mild north wind, which produces that fine
weather vulgarly called Saint Martin's Sum∣mer<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Traité des eaux de M. Mariotte.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Doctor Lister alledges, that the east wind,
which reigns during the whole year between
the tropics, is occasioned by the transpiration of
the plant called the <HI>sea-lentil,</HI> which abounds in
these climates; and that the difference of land∣winds
is owing to the different situation of trees
<PB N="375" REF="410"/>
and forests. This ridiculous whim he assigns
as the cause of the winds; and, in his opinion,
the wind is strongest at mid-day, because the
transpiration from plants is then the greatest;
and the wind, continues he, blows from east
to west, because all plants are, in some measure,
sun-flowers, and transpire most from the side
opposite to the sun<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Phil. Trans. No. 156.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Other authors have assigned the diurnal mo∣tion
of the earth as the cause of this east wind.
This notion is specious: But every man, who
has the least knowledge of physics, must allow,
that no fluid which surrounds the earth can be
affected by its rotation; that the air must move
along with the earth itself; and that the rota∣tory
motion is equally imperceptible in the at∣mosphere,
as on the surface of the earth.</P>
<P>The principal cause of the winds, as already
remarked, is the heat of the sun<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Halley's treatise on this subject in the Phil. Trans.</NOTE>; for, what∣ever
rarefies or condenses the air, must produce
a wind or current in a direction opposite to those
places where the rarefaction or condensation is
greatest.</P>
<P>The pressure of clouds, exhalations from the
earth, the explosion of meteors, rains, &amp;c. like∣wise
produce considerable agitations in the at∣mosphere.
Each of these causes, when various∣ly
combined, produce different effects. As it is
in vain to attempt a compleat theory of the
winds, I confine myself to their history.</P>
<P><PB N="376" REF="411"/>
If we had a series of observations upon the di∣rection,
the force, and the variations of the winds
in the different climates of the earth, and if these
observations were sufficiently numerous and ex∣act,
we might be enabled to form more compleat
ideas with regard to the causes of the different
changes in the atmosphere, than we at present
possess.</P>
<P>The winds are more regular at sea than upon
land; because their motion is not interrupted.
But, upon land, the direction is often changed
by the interposition of mountains, forests, cities,
and other obstacles. Winds are often reflected
from mountains with a force nearly equal to that
of their original current: These winds are exceed∣ingly
irregular, because their direction depends
on the contour, the height, and the situation of
the mountains from which they rebound. The
sea-winds also blow with more force and uni∣formity,
and last longer: The land-winds, how∣ever
violent, have intermissions and moments of
repose: But, at sea, the current of the air, ha∣ving
no obstacles to contend with, is uniform
and perpetual.</P>
<P>At sea, the east winds, and those which come
from the Poles, are generally stronger than the
west winds, and those that proceed from the E∣quator.
But, at land, the south and west winds
are more or less violent, according to the differ∣ent
situation of particular countries. During
spring and autumn, the winds, both at sea and
<PB N="377" REF="412"/>
land, are more violent than in summer or win∣ter.
For this, several reasons may be assigned:
1. In spring and autumn the tides are highest;
and, consequently, the winds they excite are
most violent during these seasons: 2. The mo∣tion
produced in the atmosphere by the action
of the sun and moon, or the tides of the air, must
likewise be greatest at the equinoxial seasons:
3. The melting of the snows in spring, and the
condensation of the vapours exhaled in summer
by the sun, and which fall down in the autumn
in the form of rain, produce, or, at least, aug∣ment
the force of the winds. 4. The transition
from heat to cold, or from cold to heat, must
create considerable augmentation and diminu∣tion
in the volume of the air, which alone is suf∣ficient
to raise great winds.</P>
<P>Contrary currents in the atmosphere have oft∣en
been remarked. We see some clouds mo∣ving
in one direction, and others, either above
or below them, proceeding in a direction per∣fectly
opposite. This contrariety of motion ne∣ver
continues long; because its general cause is
the resistence of some large cloud, which reflects
the wind in a direction opposite to its natural
course, but is soon dissipated.</P>
<P>The winds are more violent in proportion to
the elevation of the ground, till it arrive at the
ordinary station of the clouds, which is about
one-fourth or one-third of a league perpendi∣cular
height; and beyond this, the sky is gene∣rally
<PB N="378" REF="413"/>
serene, especially in summer, and the wind
gradually diminishes: It is even said to be alto∣gether
imperceptible on the tops of the highest
mountains. However, as the summits of these
mountains are covered with ice and snow, it is
natural to think, that this region of the air is
agitated during the fall of the snows, and, that
the winds are only imperceptible in the summer
season. The light vapours which are raised in
summer fall in the form of dews; but, in winter,
they are condensed, and fall on the tops of the
mountains in the form of snow or ice, which
may raise considerable winds at that altitude.</P>
<P>The celerity of a current of air is augmented
when its passage is contracted. The same wind,
which is but slightly felt in a large open plain, be∣comes
violent in going through a narrow pass in
a mountain, or between two high houses; and it
is most violent at the tops of the buildings or of
the mountain, because the air being compressed
by these obstacles, is augmented both in volume
and density; and, as its celerity remains the
same, its force or momentum must be increased.
It is for this reason that the wind appears to be
more violent near a church or a tour than at a
distance from them. I have often remarked,
that the wind reflected from a building stand∣ing
by itself is stronger than the direct wind
which produced it. This effect can be owing to
no other cause than the compression of the air
against the building from which it rebounds.</P>
<P><PB N="379" REF="414"/>
As the density of the air is greatest at the
surface of the earth, it is natural to conclude,
that the wind must there also be most violent;
and this conclusion is, I apprehend, just, when
the sky is serene: But, when it is charged with
clouds, the action of the wind will be most vio∣lent
at the height of the clouds, which are den∣ser
than air, as they fall in the form of rain or
of hail. In computing the force of wind, there∣fore,
we ought to estimate not only its veloci∣ty,
but likewise the density of the air; for, two
winds of equal velocities may differ greatly in
their force, if the densities of the air be unequal.
From this remark, we may learn the imperfec∣tion
of those machines which have been em∣ployed
for measuring the velocity of the winds.</P>
<P>Particular winds, whether they be direct or
reflected, are more violent than those that are
general. The interrupted action of land-winds
depends on the compression of the air, which
renders every blast more violent than if the cur∣rent
were uniform. A uniformly continued
stream of air produces not such havock as the
fury of those winds which blow, as it were, by
paroxysins. But of this we shall treat more fully
in the next article.</P>
<P>The winds, in their various directions, may
be considered under general points of view,
from which, perhaps, some useful deductions
may be drawn. For example, the winds may
be divided into Zones. The east wind, which
<PB N="380" REF="415"/>
extends 25 or 30 degrees on each side of the
Equator, exerts its force round the globe within
the Torrid Zone. The north wind blows with
equal constancy in both the Frigid Zones. Thus,
the east wind occupies the Torrid Zone, and the
north wind the Frigid Zones. With regard to
the Temperate Zones, the winds peculiar to
them may be considered only as currents of air,
produced by the combination of the two princi∣pal
winds, which gives rise to all those that
come from the eastern points; and the west
winds, which are common in the Temperate
Zones, both in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans,
may be considered as reflections from the con∣tinents
of Asia and America, but deriving their
origin principally from the east and north winds.</P>
<P>Though we have said, that, generally speak∣ing,
the east wind blows round the globe 25 or
30 degrees on each side of the Equator; yet it
must be acknowledged, that, in some places, it
extends not so far, and that its direction is not
throughout from east to west; for, on this side
of the Equator, it is east-north-east, and, beyond
the Equator, it is east-south-east, and, the more
we recede from the Equator, its direction is the
more oblique. The Equator is the line under
which the direction of the wind from east to
west is most exact. In the Indian Ocean, for
example, the general wind from east to west ex∣tends
not above 15 degrees beyond the Equator.
In going from Goa to the Cape of Good Hope,
<PB N="381" REF="416"/>
this wind is not felt beyond the 12th degree of
south latitude, nor is it perceptible on this side
of the Equator. But, after arriving at the 12th
degree of south latitude, this wind continues to
the 28th degree. In the sea which separates A∣frica
from america, there is an interval from the
4th degree of north latitude to the 10th or 11th
of south latitude, where this general wind is not
perceived. But, beyond the 10th or 11th de∣gree,
it extends to the 30th.</P>
<P>There are likewise many deviations in the
trade-winds, which have an alternate motion.
Some continue for a longer or shorter time; o∣thers
have a greater or lesser extent; others are
more or less regular, and more or less violent.
The following, according to Varenius, are the
principal phaenomena of these winds. 'In the
ocean between Africa and India, and as far as
the Molucca islands, the east wind commences
in January, and continues to the beginning of
June. In the month of August, the west wind
begins, and continues for three or four months.
In the interval between these trade-winds,
which is between the end of June and the be∣ginning
of August, the sea is infested with vi∣olent
tempests from the north.'</P>
<P>'These winds are subject to the greatest va∣riations
near the coasts: Vessels cannot take
their departure from the coast of Malabar, and
other ports on the west coast of the peninsula
of India, to Africa, Arabia, or Persia, but from
<PB N="382" REF="417"/>
the month of January to April or May; for,
at the end of May, and during the months of
June, July, and August, the tempests from
the north and north-east are so violent, that
no ships can keep the seas. But, on the o∣ther
side of this peninsula, in the sea which
washes the coast of Coromandel, there are no
tempests of this kind.'</P>
<P>'Vessels depart from Java, Ceylon, and se∣veral
other places, for the Molucca's in Sep∣tember,
because the west wind begins then to
blow in these regions. However, when 15
degrees south of the Equator, this wind ceases,
and they fall in with the trade-wind, which,
in this place, blows from the south-east. In
the same manner, vessels depart from Cochin
for Malacca in March; because, at this time,
the west wind begins to blow. Thus the west
winds arise at different times, in different parts
of the Indian Ocean. The times of departure
are different from Java to the Molucca's, from
Cochin to Malacca, from Malacca to China,
and from China to Japan.'</P>
<P>'At Banda, the west winds terminate at the
end of March; calm and variable winds occu∣py
the month of April; and the east winds
begin with great violence in May. At Cey∣lon,
the west winds commence about the mid∣dle
of March, and continue to the beginning
of October, when the east, or rather east-north-east
winds return. At Madagascar, they have
<PB N="383" REF="418"/>
north or morth-west winds from the middle
of April to the end of May; but east and
south winds in February and March. From
Madagascar to the Cape of Good Hope, the
northerly winds prevail during the months of
March and April. In the gulf of Bengal, af∣ter
the 20th of April, the south winds blow
with violence; and, before this period, the
south-west and north-west winds prevail. The
westerly winds are also violent in the Chinese
sea during the months of June and July. This
is, therefore, the most proper season for sail∣ing
from China to Japan: But, in returning
from Japan to China, February and March are
preferable, because the easterly winds then
prevail.'</P>
<P>'There are some winds which may be con∣sidered
as peculiar to certain coasts: For ex∣ample,
a south wind blows almost perpetually
on the coasts of Chili and Peru. It begins a∣bout
the 46th degree of south latitude, and ex∣tends
beyond Panama, which makes the voy∣age
from Lima to Panama more easy and ex∣peditious
than the return. The westerly winds
blow almost continually on the coasts of Ma∣gellan's
land, in the neighbourhood of the
straits of Le Maire. Upon the Malabar coast,
they have almost constantly north and north∣west
winds. The north wind is very frequent
on the coast of Guinea. The westerly winds
<PB N="384" REF="419"/>
reign upon the coasts of Japan during the
months of November and December.'</P>
<P>The periodic, or alternate winds, mentioned
above, are peculiar to the sea. But, upon land,
there are also periodic winds, which return at
certain seasons, or particular days, or even at
stated hours. On the coast of Malabar, for ex∣ample,
an easterly land-wind blows from Sep∣tember
to April: It generally commences at
midnight, and ends at noon; and it is not percep∣tible
at 12 or 15 leagues from the coast. From
noon to midnight, there is a gentle westerly
breeze from the sea. Upon the coasts of New
Spain in America, and upon those of Congo
in Africa, land-winds blow during the night,
and sea-winds during the day. Winds blow
from all the coasts of Jamaica during the night,
which prevents the landing, or sailing of ships,
with safety, before the rising of the sun.</P>
<P>In winter, the port of Cochin is inaccessible;
neither can any vessel get out; because the winds
are so impetuous, that no vessels can keep the
sea; and, besides, the west wind, which blows
with great fury, drives such a quantity of sand
into the mouth of the river, as renders it impos∣sible
for ships of any burden to enter it for six
months of the year. But the east wind, which
blows during the other six months, drives back
the sand into the sea, and opens the mouth of
the river. At the straits of Babelmandel, there
blows a south-east wind, which is regularly suc∣ceeded
<PB N="385" REF="420"/>
by the north-east. At Saint Domingo,
there are two different winds which rise regu∣larly
every day; the one, which is from the sea,
comes from the east, and begins at 10 o'clock
before noon; the other, which is a land-wind
from the west, rises at 6 or 7 in the evening,
and continues the whole night. Other facts of
this kind, collected from voyagers of knowledge
and credit, might furnish a compleat history of
the winds, which would be a work extremely
useful both to navigation and physics.</P>

THEORY OF THE EARTH.</HEAD>
<HEAD>ARTICLE XV.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of Irregular Winds, Hurricanes, Water-Spouts;
and other Phaenomena, occasioned by the agita∣tion
of the Sea, and of the Air.</HEAD>
<P>THE winds are more irregular on the land
than on the sea, and in high than in low
countries. The mountains not only change the
direction of the winds, but even produce some,
which are either constant or variable, according
to their causes. The melting of snows on the
tops of the mountains generally give rise to
constant winds which last a considerable time.
The vapours which strike against the mountains,
and accumulate upon them, produce variable
winds, which are very common in all climates;
and there is as great a variety in the motions of
<PB N="387" REF="422"/>
the air, as there are inequalities on the surface
of the earth. We can only, therefore, give ex∣amples
and genuine history of facts: And, as
a connected series of observations upon the va∣riations
of the winds, and even of the seasons,
in different countries, is still wanting, we shall
not attempt to explain all the causes of these va∣riations,
but shall confine ourselves to those which
are most probable.</P>
<P>In straits, at the extremities of promontories,
peninsula's, and capes, and in all narrow bays,
tempestuous winds are frequent. But, indepen∣dent
of these, some seas are much more infested
with storms than others. The Indian Ocean
the seas of Japan and of Magellan, along the Afri∣can
coast beyond the Canaries, and the opposite
coast near Natal, and the Red and Vermilion
Seas, are all subject to tempests. The Atlantic
is likewise more tempestuous than the great o∣cean
called the Pacific: This ocean, however,
is no where perfectly tranquil, but between the
Tropics; for the nearer we approach the poles,
it is the more subject to variable winds, the sud∣den
changes of which produce tempests.</P>
<P>All continents are subject to the effects of va∣riable
winds, which are sometimes very singu∣lar.
In the kingdom of Cassimir, which is sur∣rounded
with the mountains of Caucasus, a most
sudden reverse of seasons is felt on Mount Pire∣penjale.
In less than an hour's journey, we pass
from summer to winter: A north and a south
<PB N="388" REF="423"/>
wind, according to Bernier, blow perceptibly
within 200 paces of each other. The position
of this mountain must be singular; and, there∣fore,
it merits a particular examination. In the
peninsula of India, which is traversed from north
to south by the mountains of Gate, the extreme
heats of summer are felt on one side of those moun∣tains,
and all the rigours of winter on the other.
The same phaenomenon takes place on the two
opposite coasts of Cape Rosalgate in Arabia:
On the north coast the sea is calm and tranquil;
while the south coast is infested with continual
storms. Geylon exhibits another example of
this phaenomenon; winter and high winds
reign in the north part of the island, while, on
the south side of it, fine weather and summer
heats prevail. Of opposite seasons in the neigh∣bourhood
of each other, and at the same time,
there are several examples, not only on the con∣tinent,
but on the islands, as at Cerem, a long
island near Amboyna, in the north part of which
it is winter, and summer in the south part; and
the interval between these two seasons is not a∣bove
three or four leagues.</P>
<P>In Egypt a south wind prevails in summer,
which is so hot as to stop respiration; and it
raises such immense quantities of sand, that the
sky seems to be covered with thick clouds. This
sand is so fine, and is blown with such violence,
that it penetrates the closest chests. When these
winds continue for several days, they give rise
<PB N="389" REF="424"/>
to epidemic diseases, which frequently cut off
vast numbers of men. It seldom rains in Egypt;
every year, however, there are some days of rain
in the months of December, January, and Fe∣bruary.
But thick fogs are more frequent than
rain, especially in the neighbourhood of Cairo.
These fogs commence in November, and con∣tinue
during the winter; and, through the whole
year, even when the sky is serene, the dews fall
so copiously, that they have all the effects of
rain.</P>
<P>In Persia, the winter commences in Novem∣ber,
and lasts till March. The cold is strong e∣nough
to produce ice; and snows fall in the
mountains, and sometimes in the plains. From
March to May, they have violent winds, which
recal the warmth of summer. From May to
September the sky is serene, and the heats are
moderated during the night by fresh breezes
which continue till morning; and, in autumn,
they have violent winds, like those which blow in
the spring. However, though these winds are
very strong, they seldom produce tempests or
hurricanes. But, in summer, a very noxious
wind blows along the Persic Gulf, which is call∣ed
<HI>Samiel</HI> by the natives; it is still hotter and
more terrible than that of Egypt; and acting
like an explosion of inflamed vapour, it susso∣cates
every person who unhappily falls within
its vortex. A similar wind rises in summer a∣long
the Red Sea, which sussocates animals, and
<PB N="390" REF="425"/>
transports such quantities of sand, that many
people imagine this sea will, in the course
of time, be compleatly filled up with it. Ara∣bia
gives birth to frequent clouds of sand which
darken the air, and excite dangerous whirlwinds.
At Vera Cruz, when the hot winds blow from
the north, the houses of that town are almost
buried with sand. Hot winds are also felt in
summer at Negapatan in India, and likewise at
Petapouli and Masulapatan. These scorching
winds which kill men, are fortunately of no long
duration; but they are extremely violent, and
their heat and deleterious quality are propor∣tioned
to their velocity; which is contrary to
the nature of other winds; for the more their
rapidity, they are the more wholesome and re∣freshing.
This difference proceeds from the de∣gree
of heat in the air. When the heat of the
air is less than that of the body, the motion of
the air is agreeable. But, when the heat of the
air is greater than that of the bodies of animals,
its motion scorches and sussocates. At Goa, the
winter, or rather the rainy and tempestuous sea∣son,
is in the months of May, June, and July;
it cools and refreshes the air, which would o∣therwise
be perfectly insupportable in that re∣gion.</P>
<P>The Cape of Good Hope is famous for its
tempests, and a peculiar cloud which produces
them. This cloud at first appears like a small
round spot in the heavens, which mariners di∣stinguish
<PB N="391" REF="426"/>
by the name of the <HI>Ox's Eye.</HI> The
seeming smallness of this cloud is probably ow∣ing
to its great height. Of all voyagers who
mention this cloud, Kolbe appears to have ex∣amined
it with the greatest attention. 'This
cloud,' says he<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tom. 1. p. 224.</NOTE>, 'which appears on the moun∣tains
of the <HI>Table,</HI> or of the <HI>Devil,</HI> or of the
<HI>Wind,</HI> is composed, if I am not deceived, of an
infinite number of particles pushed, in the first
place, against the mountains to the east of the
Cape, by the east wind which blows in the
Torrid Zone during almost the whole year.
These particles or vapours are stopped by the
high mountains, and are collected on their
east side. They then become visible in the
form of small fragments of clouds, which, by
the constant action of the east wind, are ele∣vated
to the tops of the mountains. Here
they remain not long at rest; but, being for∣ced
to advance, they sink down between the
mountains that are still before them, where
they are locked up and squeezed on all sides
as in a canal. The wind presses these vapours
from above, and the opposite sides of the two
mountains confine them on the right and left,
till, in their progress, they advance to the foot
of some mountain where the country is more flat
and open; they then expand, and become
again invisible. But they are soon pushed
against another ridge of mountains by fresh
<PB N="392" REF="427"/>
clouds coming up behind them; and in this
manner they proceed till they arrive with vast
impetuosity at the top of the highest moun∣tains
of the Cape, which are those of the
<HI>Wind</HI> or of the <HI>Table,</HI> where they are met by a
wind blowing in the very opposite direction.
Here a dreadful conflict ensues. The vapours
are pressed both before and behind, which pro∣duces
terrible whirlwinds, either on the moun∣tains
of the <HI>Table,</HI> or in the vallies. When the
north-west wind yields, that of the south-east
increases, and continues to blow with more or
less violence for six months. When the <HI>Ox's
Eye</HI> is thick, the force of the south-east wind
augments, because the vapours amassed behind
the mountains continually press forward; for
the same reason, this wind diminishes when
the <HI>Ox's Eye</HI> is thin; and it entirely ceases
when the <HI>Ox's Eye</HI> vanishes, because no va∣pours
arrive from the east.'</P>
<P>'The circumstances attending this phaeno∣menon
lead to the following hypothesis:
1. Behind the mountain of the <HI>Table,</HI> a train
of thin white vapour is observed, which com∣mences
on the eastern declivity of this moun∣tain,
ends in a sharp point at the sea, and occu∣pies,
in its extent, the whole mountains of
<HI>Stone.</HI> I have often contemplated this train,
and imagined it to originate from the rapid
motion of the vapour above described, from
the mountains of <HI>Stone</HI> to that of the <HI>Table.</HI>'</P>
<P><PB N="393" REF="428"/>
'2. The passage of these vapours must be ex∣tremely
embarrassed by the contrary shocks
received, not only from the mountains, but
from the south and east winds which prevail
in the neighbourhood of the Cape. I have al∣ready
mentioned the two mountains situated
on the points of <HI>False bay,</HI> the one called the
<HI>Hanging Lip,</HI> the other the <HI>Norvege.</HI> When
the particles or vapours, which I have conjec∣tured,
are pushed against those mountains by
the east winds, they are repelled by the south
winds, and driven against the neighbouring
mountains, where they are detained for some
time, and appear like clouds, as they often do
upon the mountains of <HI>False bay,</HI> and even be∣yond
them. These clouds are frequently very
thick above the land in the possession of the Dutch,
upon the mountains of <HI>Stellenbosck,</HI> of <HI>Draken∣stein,</HI>
and of <HI>Stone,</HI> but especially upon the
mountains of the <HI>Table</HI> and of the <HI>Devil.</HI>'</P>
<P>'Lastly, The constant appearance of small
black clouds upon the <HI>Lion's Head</HI> two or three
days before the south-east winds blow, con∣firms
me in my conjecture; for these clouds,
in my opinion, are composed of the particles
or vapour mentioned above. If the north-west
wind prevails when these particles arrive,
their course is stopped; but they are never
driven to any great distance till the south-east
wind commences.'</P>
<P><PB N="394" REF="429"/>
The navigators who first approached the Cape
of Good Hope, were ignorant of the effects of
these clouds, which seemed to arise slowly and
without any agitation in the air, but which, in
a moment, excite the most furious tempests, and
precipitate the largest vessels to the bottom of
the ocean. In the country of Natal, a cloud si∣milar
to the Ox's Eye at the Cape, produces the
same direful effects. These species of tempests
are frequent in the Atlantic, especially in the
neighbourhood of the Equator. Near the coast
of Guiney, three or four of these storms some∣times
happen in a day, which are likewise occa∣sioned
and announced by small black clouds,
while the rest of the sky is generally serene,
and the sea perfectly calm. It is principally in
April, May, and June, that these furious storms
arise along the coast of Guiney, because no re∣gular
winds blow there at that season. On the
coast of Loango, the stormy season is in the months
of January, February, March, and April. At
Cape Gardafu, on the other side of Africa, they
have storms of this kind in May, and the clouds
which produce them are generally in the north,
like those of the Cape of Good Hope.</P>
<P>All these storms originate from winds that is∣sue
from a cloud; and their direction is from
north to south, or from north-east to south-west,
&amp;c. But there are tempests of another kind,
called Whirlwinds, which are still more violent,
and in which the wind seems to blow from e∣very
<PB N="395" REF="430"/>
quarter at once. Their motion is circular,
and nothing can resist their fury. They are ge∣nerally
preceded by a dead calm; but, in an
instant, the waves are elevated to the clouds by
the fury of the winds. Some parts of the sea
cannot be approached; because they are perpe∣tually
infested either with calms or whirlwinds.
These places have been called <HI>calms</HI> and <HI>torna∣dos</HI>
by the Spaniards. The most considerable
of them are near Guiney, about the 2d or 3d
degree of north latitude. They extend about
300 or 350 leagues in length, and nearly as
much in breadth, which includes a space of more
than 100,000 square leagues.</P>
<P>When contrary winds arrive at the same
time in the same place, they produce whirlwinds,
by the opposite motion of the air, in the same
manner as whirlpools are produced in the sea
by contrary currents. But, when those oppo∣site
winds are counterbalanced by their distant
action upon each other, they then revolve in a
great circle, and produce a perfect calm, which
it is impossible for vessels to pass through. These
places are all marked in the globes of Mr Se∣nex.
I am inclined to think, that the contrariety
of the winds alone, if not assisted by the direc∣tion
of the coasts, and the particular structure
of the bottom of the sea in these places, could
not produce this effect. I imagine that the cur∣rents,
which are in effect occasioned by the
winds, but assume their direction from the fi∣gure
<PB N="396" REF="431"/>
of the coasts and the inequalities at the
bottom, terminate in these places; and that their
opposite motions, in a plain surrounded with a
chain of mountains, give rise to the tornados in
question.</P>
<P>Whirlpools seem to be nothing else but cir∣cular
motions of the waters occasioned by the
action of two or more opposite currents. The
Euripus, so famed by the death of Aristotle, al∣ternately
absorbs and rejects the water seven
times every 24 hours. This whirlpool is near
the coast of Greece. Charybdis, which lies near
the straits of Sicily, rejects and absorbs the wa∣ter
thrice in 24 hours. We are uncertain as to
the number of alternate motions in other whirl∣pools.
Dr Placentia informs us, that the mo∣tions
of the Euripus are irregular for 18 or 19
days every month, and regular during the other
11; and that it seldom swells above one, or at
most two feet. He farther informs us, that au∣thors
are not agreed as to the tides in the Eu∣ripus;
that some say it is twice, others seven
times, some eleven, others 12 or 14 times in
24 hours; but that Loirius, who examined it
attentively, found that the tides rose regularly e∣very
six hours, and that their motion was suffi∣cient
to turn a mill-wheel.</P>
<P>The largest known whirlpool is in the sea of
Norway, the circumference of which exceeds
20 leagues. It absorbs, for six hours, water,
whales, ships, and any thing that approaches it,
<PB N="397" REF="432"/>
and the next six hours are employed in throwing
them up again.</P>
<P>To account for these whirlpools, it is unne∣cessary
to have recourse to an abyss, or to pits in
the bottom of the sea, which are perpetually
swallowing the waters. It is well known, that,
when water has two directions, the combination
of these motions produces a whirling, and exhi∣bits
the appearance of a void space in the middle.
In the same manner, whirlpools in the sea are
occasioned by two or more contrary currents;
and, as the tides are the principal cause of cur∣rents,
and, of course, they run for six hours in
contrary directions, it is not surprising, that the
whirlpools which are produced by them should
alternately reject and absorb every thing within
their reach during the same portions of time.</P>
<P>Whirlpools, then, are occasioned by contrary
currents, and whirlwinds by the conflict of
contrary winds. These whirlwinds are com∣mon
in the Chinese and Japanese seas, near the
Antilles, and in many other places of the ocean,
particularly in the neighbourhood of prominent
coasts. But they are still more frequent upon
land; and their effects are sometimes prodigious.
'I have seen,' says Bellarmin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Ascensu Mentis in Deum</NOTE>, 'an enormous
ditch scooped out by the wind, transported in
the air, and dropped upon a village, which was
for ever buried under this load of earth.' A
detail of the effects of several hurricanes may be
<PB N="398" REF="433"/>
seen in the history of the French Academy, and
in the Philosophical Transactions, which would
appear altogether inconceivable, if they were not
attested by intelligent and credible spectators.</P>
<P>The same observation may be made with re∣gard
to water-spouts, which the mariner never
beholds without terror and amazement. They
are very common on certain coasts of the Medi∣terranean,
especially when the weather is cloudy,
and the wind blows from several coasts at the
same time. They are more frequent near the
coasts of Laodicea, of Grecgo, and of Carmel,
than in any other part of the Mediterranean.
Most of them are large cylinders of water which
fall from the clouds, though, at a distance, the
water appears to rise up from the sea to the
clouds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Shaw's travels.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But there are two species of water-spouts;
the first is that we have just mentioned, and is
nothing but a thick cloud compressed, and sur∣rounded
by opposite winds blowing from dif∣ferent
coasts at the same time, which make it
assume a cylindric figure, and fall down by its
own gravity. The quantity of water is so im∣mense,
and the rapidity of the fall so great, that
if, unfortunately, one of these spouts break up∣on
a ship, it dashes it to pieces, and sinks it in
an instant. It is alledged, and with probability,
that water-spouts may be broken and dissipated
by the commotion excited in the air by the
<PB N="399" REF="434"/>
firing of cannons, which corresponds with the
dissipation of thunder-clouds by the ringing of
bells.</P>
<P>The other species of water-spout is called a
<HI>typhon,</HI> and is very frequent in the Chinese Sea.
The typhon descends not from the clouds, nor
is produced by the action of opposite winds. It,
on the contrary, rises from the water to the
heavens with amazing rapidity. Whirlwinds
often run along considerable tracts, bearing
down houses, trees, and every obstacle that they
meet with. But typhons remain always in the
same places, and can be owing to nothing but
subterraneous fires; for the sea is then in the
greatest agitation, and the air is so impregnated
with sulphureous exhalations, that the sky ap∣pears
to be covered with a copper-coloured crust,
although there be no clouds, and the sun or the
stars appear through the vapour. It is to these
subterranean fires that we must ascribe the warmth
of the Chinese Sea in winter, where these ty∣phons
are very frequent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Acta erud. Lips. supplem. tom. 1. p. 405.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Thevenote, in his voyage to the east, gives
the following account of water-spouts: 'We saw
water-spouts in the Persic gulf, between the
islands of Quesomo, Lareca, and Ormutz. Few
have had the opportunity, and fewer still have
paid the attention to water-spouts, that I have
done. I shall describe them with perspicuity
<PB N="400" REF="435"/>
and simplicity, in order to render my account
the more easily intelligible.'</P>
<P>'The first that we saw, was on the north side
between us and the island of Quesomo, about
a gun-shot from our ship. In this place, we
saw the water begin to boil, and to be raised
about a foot above the surface: It was whitish,
and the top of it appeared like black smoke:
It made a kind of whispering noise, like a tor∣rent
rushing down with violence into a deep
valley. This noise was mingled with another
that resembled the hissing of serpents. A little
afterwards, we saw an obscure canal or pipe,
which resembled smoke rising to the clouds,
and revolved with considerable velocity: This
pipe was about the size of a man's finger; and
the same noise continued. It then vanished,
having continued in all about a quarter of an
hour. We then perceived another on the
south, which began in the same manner as the
former: Immediately a third sprung up to the
west, and then a fourth likewise to the west;
the most distant not exceeding a musket-shot
from us. Each of them appeared like heaps
of smoking straw, and were accompanied
with the same noise as the first. We next per∣ceived
three pipes, or canals, extending from
the water to the clouds, where each of them
terminated like the mouth of a funnel or
trumpet, or like the paps of an animal drawn
perpendicularly downward by a weight. These
<PB N="401" REF="436"/>
pipes were of a dark white colour, which I
imagined to be owing to the water they con∣tained;
for the pipes appeared to be formed
before they were filled with the water, and
they disappeared when they were empty; in
the same manner as a cylinder of clear glass,
when held up in the light at a distance from
the eye, is not visible, unless it be filled with
some coloured liquor. These pipes were not
straight, but bent in some places: They were
not even perpendicular; on the contrary, from
the clouds into which they were ingrafted, to
the places from which they extracted the wa∣ter,
they were very much inclined. And,
what is singular, the cloud to which the second
of the three was attached, having been pushed
forward by the wind, the pipe followed it
without breaking, or quitting its station in the
water; and, passing behind the pipe of the first,
they remained for some time in the form of a
St Andrew's cross. At first, none of the three
exceeded an inch in thickness, excepting where
they joined the cloud: But the one that ap∣peared
first, swelled afterwards considerably.
The other two continued not longer than the
one we had seen to the north. The second,
on the south, lasted about a quarter of an
hour; but the first, on the same side of the
vessel, continued longer, and gave us some un∣easiness;
of it, therefore, we have still farther
to remark, that, although it originally was not
<PB N="402" REF="437"/>
larger than a man's finger, it gradually swelled
to the size of an arm, then to that of a leg,
and, <HI>lastly,</HI> to that of the trunk of a tree as large
as a man could encompass with both his arms.
We saw the water rising distinctly through
this transparent body, which was of a serpen∣tine
form; and it sometimes diminished in
thickness both above and below. It now ex∣actly
resembled a soft tube filled with water, and
pressed with the fingers, either above to make
the fluid descend, or below to make it ascend;
and I was satisfied that these variations were
occasioned by the wind, which, when it pres∣sed
the canal above, caused the water to de∣scend,
and when the pressure was lower down,
made the water ascend. After this, it dimi∣nished
to the size of a man's arm; then it swel∣led
to the size of a thigh; then became ex∣ceedingly
small; <HI>lastly,</HI> I perceived that the
water elevated from the surface began to sink,
and the end of the canal separated from it;
when a variation of the light removed it from
my view. I still, however, continued to look
for it, because I had remarked, that the canal
of the second spout appeared to break in the
middle, and to reunite a little afterwards, one
half of it having been concealed by the light;
but this last never more appeared.'</P>
<P>'These spouts are exceedingly dangerous at
sea; for, when they fall upon a vessel, they
mingle so with the sails, that they sometimes
<PB N="403" REF="438"/>
raise the vessel up, and let it fall back again
with such violence as to sink it. But, although
they should not raise the ship, they tear the
sails, or let the whole water they contain fall
upon the vessel, which precipitates it to the
bottom. It is not improbable, that many ves∣sels,
of which we never have any accounts,
perish by such accidents; for there are few
examples of our ever learning with certainty
of ships being lost in this manner.'</P>
<P>In the above account of water-spouts, there
appears to be several optical illusions. But I
have related the facts <HI>verbatim,</HI> that they may
either be confirmed, or at least compared with
those of other navigators. M. Gentil, in his
voyage round the world, describes water-spouts
in the following manner: 'At eleven o'clock,
before noon, the sky being cloudy, we saw
round our ship, at the distance of about a quar∣ter
of a league, six water-spouts, which began
with a noise like that of water running below
ground, and gradually increased till it resembled
the hissing noise occasioned by a high wind a∣mong
the ropes of a ship. We first perceived
that the sea began to boil; and its surface rose
about a foot and a half; the top of this ele∣vated
part was covered with a thick fog, or
rather smoke, which formed itself into a canal,
and mounted to the clouds. These canals
bended according as the wind carried the
clouds to which they were attached. Not∣withstanding
<PB N="404" REF="439"/>
the motion communicated to the
clouds by the wind, the canals not only ad∣hered
to them, but seemed to stretch out, or
contract, in proportion as the clouds rose high∣er,
or sunk down in the atmosphere.'</P>
<P>'These appearances gave us much uneasiness;
and our sailors, instead of encouraging each o∣ther,
increased their fears by dreadful stories.
If these spouts, said they, fall upon the ship,
they will lift her up, and then plunge her to
the bottom. Others maintained, with a deci∣sive
tone, that they would not lift the vessel;
but that, being full of water, if the ship went
forward, she would break their communication
with the sea, and that the great body of water,
by falling perpendicularly on the vessel, would
break her in pieces.'</P>
<P>'To prevent this misfortune, they lowered
the sails, and charged the cannon. It is a ge∣neral
opinion among sailors, that the firing of
cannon, by agitating the air, bursts and disper∣ses
water-spouts. But we were not under the
necessity of having recourse to this expedient;
for, after coursing round the ship for about
ten minutes, some being about a quarter of a
league from us, and others nearer, the canals
became gradually narrower, detached them∣selves
from the surface of the sea, and then
entirely vanished<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tom. 1. p. 191.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P><PB N="405" REF="440"/>
From the description of these two voyagers,
it appears, that water-spouts are produced, at
least in part, by the action of fire or smoke,
which rises with violence from the bottom of
sea; and that they are very different from those
which are occasioned by opposite winds: 'The
water-spouts,' says Mr Shaw<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Shaw's travels. p. 334.</NOTE>, 'which I had
the opportunity of seeing, seemed to be so ma∣ny
cylinders of water falling down from the
clouds; though, by the reflection, it may be
of those descending columns, or from the ac∣tual
dropping of the water contained in them,
they would sometimes appear, especially at a
distance, to be sucked up from the sea. Nothing
more, perhaps, is required to explain this phae∣nomenon,
than that the clouds should be first
of all crouded together, and then, that contrary
winds, pressing violently upon them, should
occasion them to condense, and fall in this cy∣lindrical
manner.'</P>
<P>Many facts remain still to be known before these
phaenomena can be properly explained. To me
it appears, that, if there be, in particular places,
at the bottom of the sea, a mixture of sulphur,
bitumen, and mineral substances, these may oc∣casionly
be inflamed, which will produce, like
the explosion of gun-powder, a great quantity
of air; and that this air newly generated, and
rarefied to a prodigious degree, mounts with ra∣pidity,
and may elevate the water from the sea
<PB N="406" REF="441"/>
to the clouds. In the same manner, if a perpen∣dicular
current of air be produced by the explo∣sion
of sulphureous matter in a cloud, the whole
of its water may follow this current, and give
rise to a water-spout from the clouds to the sea.
But, it must be acknowledged, that this account
of the last species of spout is not more satisfac∣tory
than that which we have given of those
produced by contrary winds; for, it may be ask∣ed,
why those spouts which originate from the
clouds, are not as common on land as upon the
sea?</P>
<P>The historian of the academy for the year
1727, mentions a land water-spout which ap∣peared
at Capestan near Beziers. It descended
from a cloud like a black pillar, which gradually
diminished, and ended in a point upon the sur∣face
of the earth. It followed the direction of
the wind, which was westerly; it was attended
with a thick smoke, and made a noise like the
sea when greatly agitated. It tore up trees by
the roots, and marked its way on the earth by
a large tract in which three carriages might have
passed each other. Another pillar of the same
kind appeared, but it soon joined the first; and,
when the whole was dissipated, there fell a great
quantity of hail.</P>
<P>This species of water-spouts appears to be dif∣ferent
from the other two. It is not said to have
contained water; and it seems, both from what
I have mentioned, and by M. Andoque's expli∣cation
<PB N="407" REF="442"/>
of it to the academy, to have been only
a hurricane rendered visible by the dust and con∣densed
vapour which it contained. The same
historian, for the year 1741, mentions a water-spout
which was seen upon the lake of Geneva.
It was of a cylindrical figure, the upper part of
which ended in a black cloud, and the under
part of it was narrow, and terminated near the
surface of the water. This meteor continued
only a few minutes; and, at the moment of its
dissipation, a thick vapour ascended from the place
where it first appeared; the water of the lake
boiled, and seemed to make an effort to rise in∣to
the air, which was very calm the whole time;
neither was this spout followed either by wind
or rain. 'After all our knowledge of water-spouts,'
says the historian, 'does not this prove
that they are not produced by the conflict of
opposite winds alone, but that they almost al∣ways
originate from volcano's or subterrane∣ous
vapours, which are known to exist at the
bottom of the sea, as well as upon land? Whirl∣winds
and hurricanes, therefore, which are ge∣nerally
believed to be the cause of these appear∣ances,
may be only an effect or an accidental
consequence of them.'</P>

<HEAD>PROOFS
OF THE
THEORY OF THE EARTH.</HEAD>
<HEAD>ARTICLE XVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of Volcano's and Earthquakes.</HEAD>
<P>THE bowels of those burning mountains
called <HI>volcano's,</HI> contain sulphur, bitumen,
and other inflammable materials, the effects of
which are more violent than those of thunder
or of gun-powder; and they have, in all ages,
astonished mankind, and desolated the earth. A
volcano is an immense cannon, with an aperture
often more than half a league in circumference.
From this vast mouth are projected torrents of
smoke and of flames, rivers of bitumen, of sul∣phur,
and of melted metals, clouds of ashes and
stones; and sometimes it ejects, to the distance
of several leagues, rocks so enormous, that they
could not be moved by any combination of hu∣man
<PB N="409" REF="444"/>
man powers. The conflagration is so dreadful,
and the quantities of burning, calcined, melted,
and vitrified substances thrown out by the moun∣tain
are so great, that they bury whole towns
and forests, cover the plains to the thickness
of a hundred or two hundred feet, and some∣times
from hills and mountains, which are only
portions of these matters heaped up and com∣pacted
into one mass. The action of the fire and
the force of the explosions are so violent, that
they produce, by reaction, succussions, which
shake the earth, agitate the sea, overturn moun∣tains,
and destroy towns and buildings of the
most solid materials.</P>
<P>These effects, though natural, have been re∣garded
as prodigies; and, though we often be∣hold,
in miniature, effects similar to those of vol∣cano's;
yet grandeur, from whatever source it
proceeds, has such an astonishing influence up∣on
the imagination, that it is not surprising they
should have been considered by some authors as
vents to a central fire, and, by the vulgar, as
mouths of hell. Astonishment produces fear,
and fear is the source of superstition. The in∣habitants
of Iceland firmly believe that the groan∣ings
of their volcano are the cries of the damned,
and that its eruptions are occasioned by the de∣speration
and ungovernable fury of devils and
tormented spirits.</P>
<P>All these phaenomena, however, are only the
effects of fire and of smoke. In the bowels of
<PB N="410" REF="445"/>
mountains, there are veins of sulphur, bitumen,
and other inflammable substances, together with
vast quantities of pyrites, which ferment when
exposed to the air, or to moisture, and produce
explosions proportioned to the quantity of in∣flammable
matter. This is the true idea of a
volcano; and it is easy for the naturalist to imi∣tate
the operation of these subterraneous fires.
A mixture of sulphur, of filings of iron, and of
water, buried at a certain depth below the
ground, will exhibit, in miniature, all the ap∣pearances
of a volcano: This mixture soon fer∣ments
to a degree of inflammation, throws off
the earth and stones which cover it, and produces
explosions every way similar to those of burn∣ing
mountains.</P>
<P>The most famous volcano's in Europe are
those of Mount Aetna in Sicily, of Mount Hecla
in Iceland, and of Mount Vesuvius, near Naples
in Italy. The burning of Mount Aetna is more
antient than the records of history. Its erup∣tions
are extremely violent; and the quantity
of matter it throws out is so enormous, that, af∣ter
digging 68 feet deep, marble pavements, and
other vestiges of an antient city, have been
found covered with this amazing load of earth,
in the same manner as the town of Herculane∣um
has been buried with the matter ejected
from Mount Vesuvius. New mouths, or cra∣ters,
were opened in Aetna, in the years 1650,
1669, and at other times. The smoke and
<PB N="411" REF="446"/>
flames of this volcano are seen as far as Malta,
a distance of 60 leagues: It sends forth a perpe∣tual
smoke, and, at particular times, it throws
out, with an astonishing violence, flames, lava,
huge stones, and matter of every kind. An e∣ruption
of this volcano, in the year 1537, pro∣duced
an earthquake over the whole island of
Sicily, which lasted 12 days, and overthrew an
immense number of houses and public buildings.
It terminated by the bursting of a new mouth,
the lava of which burnt up every thing within
five leagues of the mountain. It discharged
ashes so abundantly, and with such force, that
they reached the coast of Italy, and incommoded
vessels at great distances from the island. This
volcano has, at present, two principal craters,
one of which is narrower than the other. They
both smoke perpetually; but flames only appear
during the time of eruptions. Large stones, it is
said, have been projected from them to the di∣stance
of 60,000 paces.</P>
<P>A violent eruption, in 1683, produced a
dreadful earthquake in Sicily. It laid the whole
city of Catanea in ruins, and killed more than
60,000 of its inhabitants, beside those who
perished in the neighbouring towns and villages.</P>
<P>Hecla darts its fires through the snows and
ice of a frozen climate. Its eruption, how∣ever,
are equally violent with those of Aetna,
and other volcano's in the more southern regions.
It throws out ashes, lava, pumice-stones, and
<PB N="412" REF="447"/>
sometimes boiling water. The whole island of
Iceland abounds in sulphur; but it is not habi∣table
within less than six leagues of the volcano.
The history of its most violent eruptions is re∣corded
in a book written by <HI>Dithmar Bleffken.</HI></P>
<P>According to historians, the burning of mount
Vesuvius began not before the seventh consulate
of Titus Vespasian, and Flavius Domitian. The
top of the mountain then opened, and at first
threw out stones and rocks; these were suc∣ceeded
by flames and lava, which burned up
two neighbouring cities, and volumes of smoke
so thick as to darken the light of the sun. The
elder Pliny, stimulated by curiosity, approached
too near the mountain, and was suffocated by
its sulphureous steams<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Pliny the younger's letter to Tacitus.</NOTE>. Dion Cassius relates,
that this eruption was so violent, that ashes and
sulphureous steams were transmitted as far as
Rome, and across the Mediterranean into Africa
and Egypt. Heraclea was one of the cities that
were overwhelmed by the matter ejected from
the mountain: It has lately been discovered 60
feet under the surface of the ground, which, in
the course of time, had become arable, and fit
for every kind of culture. The history of the
discovery of Heraclea is in the hands of the pu∣blic.
We have only to wish, that some person,
skilled in the knowledge of nature, would exa∣mine
with attention the different materials which
compose this 60 feet of earth, and remark their
<PB N="413" REF="448"/>
situation, the alterations they have undergone,
the direction they have followed, the hardness
they have acquired, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Naples appears to be situated upon a vault
filled with burning minerals; for Vesuvius and
Solfatara seem to have subterraneous communi∣cations.
When Vesuvius throws out lava, Sol∣fatara
emits flames; and, when the eruptions of
the former cease, the burning of the latter is
likewise extinguished. The city of Naples is
nearly in the centre between them.</P>
<P>One of the last, and most dreadful, eruptions
of Vesuvius, happened in the year 1737<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This volume was published in the year 1749. Several eruptions have happened since that time. See Hamilton's history of vesuvins.</NOTE>. The
mountain discharged, from several mouths, im∣mense
torrents of melted matter, which spread
over the fields, and terminated in the sea. M.
de Montealegre, who communicated this account
of it to the Academy of Sciences, observed, with
horror, one of these rivers of fire, which, from
its source to the sea, was about 7 miles in length,
50 or 60 paces broad, from 25 to 30 palms
deep, and in the vallies 120 palms. The running
matter resembled foam, or the dross which issues
from a furnace, &amp;c.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See l'hist. de l'Acad. année, 1737, p. 7.</NOTE></P>
<P>In Asia, and particularly in the islands of the
Indian ocean, volcano's are numerous. One of
the most famous is Mount Albours, near Mount
Taurus, about 8 leagues from Herat. The top
<PB N="414" REF="449"/>
of this mountain sends forth a pepetual smoke;
and it frequently throws out flames and burning
matter, in such quantities as to cover all the ad∣jacent
plains with ashes. In the island of Ter∣nate,
there is a volcano which discharges matter
similar to pumice-stones. Some voyagers al∣ledge,
that this volcano is most furious during
the equinoxes, because these periods are attended
with certain winds which increase the inflam∣mation
of these fires, that have continued to
burn for ages<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Voyages d'Argensola, tom. 1. p. 21.</NOTE>. The island of Ternate is not
above 7 leagues round, and is only the top of a
large mountain. The land rises from the coast
to the middle of the island, where the volcano
mounts to a height so great, that it is difficult to
get to the top of it. Several rills of sweet wa∣ter
descend from the sides of the mountain; and,
when the air is calm, and the weather fine, this
burning gulf is less agitated than during storms
and high winds<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Voyage de Schouten.</NOTE>. This confirms what I for∣merly
remarked, and seems to prove, that the
fire of volcano's proceeds not from a great
depth, but from the top, or higher parts of the
mountain; for, if it were otherwise, high winds
could not increase the violence of the flames.
There are other volcano's in the Molucca islands.
In one of the islands of Mauritius, about 70
leagues from the Moluccas, there is a volcano,
the effects of which are equally violent as those
<PB N="415" REF="450"/>
of the mountain in Ternate. The island of
Sorca, one of the Moluccas, was formerly inha∣bited.
In the middle of this island there is a
very high mountain, with a volcano at the top
of it. In 1693, this volcano discharged in im∣mense
quantity of bitumen, and inflamed mat∣ter,
which, forming a burning lake, gradually
extended till it covered the whole island<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Phil. Trans. abrid. vol. 2. p. 391.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There are several volcano's in Japan, and the
adjacent islands, which send out flames in the
night, and smoke in the day. In the Philippine
islands there are likewise several burning moun∣tains.
One of the most remarkable, and, at the
same time, the most recent volcano in the Indian
islands, is that near the town of Panarucan in the
island of Java. It commenced in the year 1586;
and, at the first eruption, it threw out immense
quantities of sulphur, bitumen, and stones. The
same year, Mount Gounapi, in the island of
Banda, which had been a volcano only about
17 years, opened and ejected, with a dreadful
noise, rocks and matter of every kind. There
are still other volcano's in India, as in Sumatra,
and in the north of Asia, beyond the river Je∣niscea,
and the river Pesida: But the two last
are little known.</P>
<P>Near Fez in Africa, there is a mountain, or
rather a cavern, called <HI>Beni-guazeval,</HI> which
constantly throws out smoke, and sometimes
flame. One of the Cape de Verd islands, called
<PB N="416" REF="451"/>
the island of <HI>Fuogo,</HI> is nothing but a huge
mountain which burns incessantly. This vol∣cano
casts out stones and ashes; and the Portu∣gueze,
who often attempted to inhabit the island,
have always abandoned the project, on account
of the volcano. The Peak of Teneriff, which
is reckoned one of the highest mountains in the
world, throws out fire, ashes, and large stones.
From the top of it, rivulets of melted sulphur
run down the south side across the snows; this
sulphur soon condenses and forms veins in the
snow, which are distinguishable at great di∣stances.</P>
<P>America, and particularly the mountains of
Mexico and Peru, are much infested with vol∣cano's:
That of Arequipa is one of the most ce∣lebrated:
It often produces great earthquakes,
which are more frequent in Peru than in any
country of the world. Next to Arequipa, the
volcano's of Carrapa and Malahallo are, accor∣ding
to the relation of travellers, the most con∣siderable.
But there are many others in the
new world of which we have no knowledge.
M. Bouguer, in his voyage to Peru, published in
the Memoirs of the Academy for the year 1744,
mentions two volcano's, the one called <HI>Cotopaxi,</HI>
and the other <HI>Pichincha.</HI> The first is at some
distance from, and the other very near, the town
of Quito. In the year 1742, he saw an erup∣tion
of Cotopaxi, which, at that time, burst
open a new mouth in the mountain. It did no
<PB N="417" REF="452"/>
other damage than that of melting the snow,
and producing such torrents, as, in three hours,
laid the whole country, to the extent of 18
leagues, under water, and overturned every thing
that came in their way.</P>
<P>Popochampeche and Popocatepec are the
chief volcano's in Mexico. It was near this last
that Cortes passed in his way to the city of
Mexico: Some of the Spaniards ascended to the
top of the mountain, where they found the cra∣ter
to be about half a league in circumference.
Sulphureous mountains have also been found in
Guadaloupe, Tercera, and in others of the A∣zore
islands; and, if all the mountains from
which smoke or flames issue were to be consi∣dered
as volcano's, their number would exceed
60. We have only mentioned those which are
so formidable as, by their frequent eruptions, to
prevent people from living near them.</P>
<P>The numerous volcano's in the Cordeliers,
as I formerly remarked, produce almost perpe∣tual
earthquakes, which prevent the inhabitants
from building with stone any higher than the first
floor; and the upper part of their houses, for the
same reason, are constructed with rushes or very
light wood. In these mountains there are also
many precipices and large gulfs, the walls of
which are black and burned: They are similar
to the precipice of Mount Ararat in Armenia,
called the <HI>Abyss,</HI> and are the craters of extinguish∣ed
volcano's.</P>
<P><PB N="418" REF="453"/>
A late earthquake at Lima was attended with
the most dreadful effects. The town of Lima,
and the port of Callao, were almost entirely
swallowed up. But the mischief was still more
terrible at Callao. The sea rose and covered
every house in that unfortunate town, and drown∣ed
the whole inhabitants, leaving only a single
tour as a monument of its devastations. Of 25
vessels that lay in the harbour, four were driven
a league upon land, and the rest swallowed up
by the waves. Of Lima, which was a very large
city, only 27 houses remained standing. Mul∣titudes
of people perished; and the disaster was
particularly fatal to the monks and other reli∣gious,
because their buildings were lofty, and of
more solid materials than the common houses.
This calamity happened in the month of Octo∣ber
1746, during the night; and the succussion
lasted 15 minutes.</P>
<P>Near the port of Pisca, in Peru, there was
formerly a famous city, situated on the sea-coast;
but, on the 19th of October 1682, it
was almost entirely destroyed by an earthquake;
for the sea, having exceeded its usual limits,
sweeped away this unfortunate city, with all its
inhabitants.</P>
<P>By consulting historians and travellers, we
shall find many accounts of earthquakes, and e∣ruptions
of volcano's, equally dreadful and de∣structive
as those we have already mentioned.
<PB N="419" REF="454"/>
Pesidonius, quoted by Strabo<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. 1.</NOTE>, relates, that a
city of Phoenicia, near Sidon, was swallowed
up by an earthquake, with the neighbouring
territory, and two thirds of Sidon itself; that
this effect was not produced so suddenly as to
prevent the inhabitants from escaping by flight;
that it extended over most of Syria, and as far
as the Cyclades islands and Euboea, where the
fountains of Arethusa suddenly stopped, and ap∣peared
a few days afterwards by new sources at
a considerable distance from the old ones; and
that the earthquake continued to shake the island
sometimes in one place, and sometimes in ano∣ther,
till the earth opened in the valley of Le∣panta,
and discharged a great quantity of burn∣ing
matter. Pliny informs us<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lib. 1. c. 84.</NOTE>, that, in the
reign of Tiberius, twelve cities in Asia were o∣verturned;
and he mentions<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lib. 2. c. 83.</NOTE>, in the following
terms, a prodigy occasioned by a violent earth∣quake.
'Factum est semel (quod equidem in

&amp;c. St Augustin tells us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. 2. de miraculis, c. 3.</NOTE>, that, in Lybia, 100
towns were destroyed by an earthquake. In
the time of Trajan, the earth opened and de∣voured
the city of Antioch, and a great part of
the adjacent country. It was again destroyed
by the same cause during the reign of Justinian
in the year 528, and 40,000 of its inhabitants
perished. It was visited with a third earthquake
in the days of St Gregory, sixty years after the
former, which destroyed no less than 60,000 of
its inhabitants. In the reign of Saladin, <HI>anno</HI>
1182, most of the cities of Syria and of Judea
were laid waste by the same calamity. Earth∣quakes
have been more frequent in Apulia and
Calabria than in any other part of Europe. In
the time of Pope Pius II. all the churches and
palaces of Naples were thrown down, and about
30,000 lives were lost: Those who escaped were
obliged to live in tents till houses were built for
them. In 1629, 7000 persons perished in A∣pulia
by earthquakes; and, in 1638, the city
of Saint Euphemia was swallowed up, and left
behind it nothing but a stinking lake: At the
same time, Ragusa and Smyrna were almost to∣tally
destroyed. In 1692, an earthquake was
felt in Britain, Holland, Flanders, Germany,
and France: It was most severe along the coasts
of the sea, and near great rivers. It agitated at
least 2600 square leagues, though it lasted but
two minutes. The commotion was greater in
<PB N="421" REF="456"/>
the mountains than in the vallies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Ray's discourses, p. 272.</NOTE>. On the
10th of July 1688, there was an earthquake at
Smyrna, which began with a motion from west
to east. The castle was first overturned; its
four walls separated from each other, and sunk
six feet in the sea. This castle stood formerly
on an isthmus, which is now a real island, about
100 paces from the land. The east and west
walls fell; but the north and south walls still re∣main.
The city, which is near ten miles from
the castle, was overthrown soon after. The
earth opened in many places, attended with sub∣terraneous
noises; and five or six dreadful shocks
were felt before the approach of night, the last
of which lasted about half a minute. The ves∣sels
in the roads were greatly agitated; the
ground on which the town stood sunk two feet;
and not above a fourth of the houses withstood
the concussion, and those were mostly founded
on rock. From fifteen to twenty thousand lives
were lost<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See l'hist. de l'acad. des sciences, anné 1688.</NOTE>. In 1695, an earthquake was felt
at Bologna in Italy; and it was remarked, as a
singular phaenomenon, that the sea was much
troubled the day preceeding<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. année 1696.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>'On the 4th of May 1614, a terrible earth∣quake
happened at Tercera, which, besides
private houses, overturned eleven churches
and nine chapels in the city of Angra; and
the city of Praya was so much shaken, that
<PB N="422" REF="457"/>
hardly a house was left standing: And, on
the 15th of June 1628, the island of St Mi∣chael
was visited with a great earthquake.
Near this island, in the open sea, there a∣rose
a new island in a place where the water
was 150 fathoms deep. This island was more
than a league and a half long, and above six
fathoms high<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mandelslo's voyages.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>'In the island of St Michael, another earth∣quake
began on the 26th of July 1691, and
continued to the 12th of the following month.
Tercera and Fayal were shaken next day with
such violence, that they seemed to turn about;
these concussions, however, were repeated
there only four times: But, at St Michael,
they ceased not a moment during the space
of eleven days. The islanders abandoned their
houses, which every where tumbled down be∣fore
their eyes, and remained the whole time
in the open fields, exposed to the injuries of
the weather. The whole town of Villa Fran∣ca
was overturned to the foundation, and most
of the inhabitants were buried under its ruins.
In several places, the plains were elevated into
hills, and, in others, the hills sunk down into
vallies. A fountain of fresh water issued from
the ground, and run for four days, and then
stopped all of a sudden. The air and the sea
were in such commotion, that they made a
noise resembling the bellowings of ferocious
<PB N="423" REF="458"/>
animals. Many people died of fear. There
was not a vessel in the harbours which were
not agitated in a dangerous manner; and those
which lay at anchor, or were under sail, at
the distance of twenty leagues, were still more
roughly handled. Earthquakes are very fre∣quent
in the Azores: Twenty years before, a
mountain in St Michael was overturned by
this dreadful calamity<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gen. hist. of voyages, vol. 1. p. 325.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>'In the month of September 1627, an earth∣quake
levelled one of the two mountains of
Manilla, called <HI>Carvallos,</HI> in the province of
Cagayon. In 1645, a third part of the city
was destroyed by a similar accident, and 300
persons perished in the ruins. The following
year it was visited by another; and the old
Indians tell us, that earthquakes are now less
dreadful than formerly; but they still build
their houses of wood, in which they are imi∣tated
by the Spaniards.'</P>
<P>'The number of volcano's in this island con∣firms
the above relation; for, at certain inter∣vals,
they vomit forth flames, shake the earth,
and produce all the effects ascribed by Pliny
to the eruptions of Vesuvius, such as, chan∣ging
the beds of rivers, making the neighbour∣ing
parts of the sea retreat, covering the pla∣ces

<P>The history of the French Academy mentions,
in the following terms, the earthquakes which
happened in Italy during the years 1702 and
1703. 'They began in October 1702, and con∣tinued
till July 1703. The city of Norcia,
with its dependencies in the ecclesiastical state,
and the province of Abruzzo, suffered most;
and the earthquakes were first felt in those
places which are situated at the foot of the
Appennines, on the south side.'</P>
<P>'They were frequently accompanied with
frightful noises in the air; and these noises
were sometimes heard when the earth was at
rest, and the sky serene. The most violent
concussion was on the 2d of February 1703;
and it was attended, especially at Rome, with
a remarkably clear sky, and a great calmness
in the air. At Rome it lasted half a minute,
and at Aquila, the capital of Abruzzo, three
<PB N="425" REF="460"/>
hours. Besides ravaging the neighbouring
country, it destroyed the whole of Aquila,
and buried 5000 persons under its ruins.'</P>
<P>'The concussions, or vibrations of the earth,
as was discovered by the motion of the lamps
in the churches, were nearly from south to
north.'</P>
<P>'The earth opened in two places, and dis∣charged
with violence great quantities of
stones, which covered the whole field, and
rendered it barren. After the stones, these
apertures threw up water above the elevation
of the highest trees. This discharge continued
a quarter of an hour, and laid the neighbour∣ing
country under water. The water was
whitish, like soap-suds, and had no particular
taste.'</P>
<P>'On the top of a mountain near Sigillo, a
village about 22 miles from Aquila, there was
a considerable plain surrounded with rocks
like a wall. The earthquake of the 2d of
February converted this plain into a large
unequal gulf, its greatest diameter being 25
fathoms, and its least 20. This gulf has been
sounded with ropes of 300 fathoms, without
reaching the bottom. At the time that this
gulf was formed, flames were observed to issue
out of the mountain, and afterwards a thick
smoke, which continued, with some interrup∣tions,
for three days.'</P>
<P><PB N="426" REF="461"/>
'At Genoa they had two slight concussions
on the 1st and 2d days of July 1703, the last
of which was only felt by the people on the
Mole. The sea, at the same time, sunk 6 feet
in the port, and continued in this situation a
quarter of an hour.'</P>
<P>'The sulphureous water on the road between
Rome and Trivoli sunk two feet and a half,
both in the basin and in the canal. The springs
and rills of water which rendered many places
of the plain called <HI>Testine</HI> marshy, were entirely
dried up. The depth of the water in the lake called
<HI>l' Enfer</HI> was diminished three feet. In place of
the old springs, new ones, about a mile distant,
appeared: They are probably the same waters,
the courses of which have been changed by the
concussion of the earth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See l'Hist. de l'Acad. des Sciences, année 1704.</NOTE>.'</P>

converted it into a marsh<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Ray's discourses, p. 12.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>'Earthquakes, also,' says Mr Shaw, 'have
sometimes been felt at sea. In the year 1724,
when I was aboard the Gazella, an Algerine
cruiser of 50 guns, bound to Bona to relieve
the garrison, we felt three prodigious shocks,
one after another, as if a weight, at each time,
of 20 or 30 ton, had fallen from a great height
upon the ballast. This happened when we
<PB N="427" REF="462"/>
were five leagues to the southward of the Seven
Capes, and could not reach ground with a line
of 200 fathom. The captain told me, that, a
few years before, when he was upon a cruise,
he felt a much greater one, at the distance of
40 leagues to the westward of the rock of Lis∣bon<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Shaw's travels, p. 151.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>Schouten, speaking of an earthquake which
happened in the Moluccas, says, that the moun∣tains
were shaken, and that the vessels at anchor
in 30 or 40 fathom water, were shocked, as if
they had run ashore, or struck against rocks.
'We learn,' continues he, 'from daily experi∣ence,
that the same happens in the ocean, where
no bottom can be found; and that earth∣quakes
agitate vessels, even when the sea is
perfectly calm<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Voyages, vol. 6, p. 103.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>Gentil, in his voyage round the world, has
the following remarks upon earthquakes: '1.
That, half an hour before the earth begins to
shake, all animals appear to be seized with a
panic. The horses neigh, break their halters,
and run out of the stable; the dogs bark; the
birds, as if stupid, fly for shelter into the
houses; the rats and mice come out of their
holes, &amp;c. 2. That ships at anchor are so
violently agitated, that all the parts of which
they are composed seem to be torn asunder;
their guns break loose, and their masts spring:
These facts I should hardly have credited, if
<PB N="428" REF="463"/>
they had not been confirmed to me by the
unanimous testimony of many witnesses. I
know that the bottom of the sea is a continu∣ation
of the land; and that agitations of the
one must be communicated to the other; but
I could not comprehend how the different
parts of a vessel, swimming in a fluid, should
be affected in the same manner as if she had
been resting on the ground. Her motion, I
imagined, should have only resembled that
produced by a storm; besides, in the present
instance, the surface of the sea was smooth,
and the whole agitation must have proceeded
from some internal cause, because, at the time
of the earthquake, there was no wind. 3.
That, if the cavern of the earth which con∣tains
the subterranean fire, runs from north to
south, and if the buildings of a town above it
lie in the same direction, the whole houses are
overturned; but, if the vein or cavern runs
across the town, the damage produced by the
earthquake is less considerable<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Voyage de M. le Gentil, tom. 1. p. 172.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>When a new volcano breaks out in countries
subject to earthquakes, they almost entirely cease,
and are seldom felt, except during great erup∣tions,
as has been observed with regard to the
island of St Christophers<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See Phil. Trans. abridg. vol. 2. p. 392.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The enormous ravages produced by earth∣quakes
have induced some naturalists to imagine,
<PB N="429" REF="464"/>
that mountains, and all the other irregularities
on the surface of the globe, have derived their
origin from succussions of the earth occasioned by
the action of subterraneous fires. This, for in∣stance,
is the opinion of Mr Ray. He believes
that all the mountains have been formed by
earthquakes, or by the explosions of volcano's,
in the same manner as Monti di Cinere in Italy,
the new island near Santorini, &amp;c. But he has
not considered, that the small elevations formed
by earthquakes, or by the eruptions of volcano's,
are not, like all other mountains, composed of
horizontal strata; for, by digging into the Mon∣ti
di Cinere, we find calcined stones, ashes, burnt
earth, iron-dross, pumice-stones, all blended
together like a heap of rubbish. Beside, if earth∣quakes
and subterraneous fires had raised the
great mountains of the earth, as the Cordeliers,
Mount Taurus, the Alps, &amp;c. the prodigious
force requisite to elevate these enormous masses
would, at the same time, have destroyed a great
part of the surface of the globe. Earthquakes
sufficient to produce such effects, must have
been inconceivably violent, since the greatest
of them recorded in history have not been able
to produce a single mountain. In the reign of
Valentinian I. for instance, an earthquake was
felt over the whole known world<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ammian. Marcellin. lib. 26. c. 14.</NOTE>, and yet not
a mountain was raised by it.</P>
<P><PB N="430" REF="465"/>
It is capable of demonstration, however, that,
though an earthquake should have a force suffi∣cient
to raise the highest mountains, this force
would not be able to displace the rest of the
globe.</P>
<P>For, let it be supposed, that the chain of high
mountains which traverse South America from
the point of Terra Magellanica to New Grana∣da
and the Gulf of Darien, had been suddenly
elevated by an earthquake, and then let us esti∣mate
the effect of this explosion. This chain of
mountains is about 1700 leagues long, and, at
a medium, 40 leagues broad, including the Si∣erres,
which are lower than the Andes. This
gives a surface of 68,000 square leagues. The
thickness of the matter displaced by the earth∣quake
I suppose to be one league; or, that the
mean height of the mountains from their summits
to the caverns, which, agreeable to this hypo∣thesis,
must support them, is one league. The
force of the explosion, therefore, must have ele∣vated,
to the height of a league, a quantity of
earth equal to 68,000 cubic leagues. But, ac∣tion
and reaction being equal, this explosion
must have communicated an equal quantity of
motion to the whole globe. Now, the whole
globe consists of 12,310,523,801 cubic leagues.
From this number take 68,000, and there re∣mains
12,310,455,801 cubic leagues, of which
the quantity of motion would be equal to that of
68,000 elevated one league. Hence it appears,
<PB N="431" REF="466"/>
that the force necessary to raise 68,000 cubic
leagues would not be sufficient to displace the
whole globe a single inch.</P>
<P>There is no absolute impossibility, therefore,
in the supposition, that the mountains have been
raised by earthquakes, were it not evident, both
from their internal structure and their external
figure, that they have been formed by the ope∣ration
of the waters of the ocean. Their inte∣rior
parts are composed of parallel strata, inter∣spersed
with sea-shells; and their external figure
consists of angles every where corresponding. Is
it credible that this uniform structure, and regu∣lar
figure, could have been produced by sudden
and desultory succussions of the earth?</P>
<P>But, as this notion has been embraced by
some philosophers, and, as the nature and effects
of earthquakes are not well understood, I shall
hazard a few ideas, which may perhaps throw
some light upon this intricate subject.</P>
<P>The surface of the earth has undergone many
changes. At considerable depths, we find holes,
caverns, subterraneous rivulets, and voids, which
sometimes communicate with each other by
means of chinks and fissures. There are two
species of caverns: The first are those which
have been formed by volcano's and the action
of subterraneous fires. The action of subterra∣neous
fire elevates, shakes, and throws off to a
distance the superincumbent materials; at the
same time, it splits and deranges those on each
<PB N="432" REF="467"/>
side of it, and thus produces caverns, grottos,
and irregular hollows. But such effects are on∣ly
exhibited in the neighbourhood of volcano's,
and are not so frequent as the other species of
caverns which are produced by the operation of
water. It has already been remarked, that the
different strata of the earth are all interrupted by
perpendicular fissures, the origin of which shall
be afterwards explained. The waters that fall
upon the surface descend through those fissures,
collect when their progress is prevented by a
stratum of clay, and form springs and rivulets.
From the nature of water, it searches for cavities
or small vacuities, and has a constant tendency
to force a passage, till it finds a proper vent.
Wherever it goes, it carries along with it sand,
gravel, and other bodies, which it is capable of
dividing or dissolving. In this manner, the o∣peration
of water proceeds till it forms subter∣raneous
passages; and then it breaks out in the
form of fountains, either on the surface of the
earth, or in the bottom of the sea. The mate∣rials
which it perpetually carries off leave hol∣lows
or caverns in the bowels of the earth,
which are often of great extent; and these ca∣verns
have a very different origin from those
produced by volcano's or earthquakes.</P>
<P>Earthquakes are of two kinds: The one is
occasioned by the action of subterraneous fires,
and by the explosions of volcano's, and are only
felt at small distances, previous to, or during the
<PB N="433" REF="468"/>
time of eruptions. When the inflammable mat∣ters
in the bowels of the earth begin to ferment
and to burn, the fire makes an effort to escape
in every direction; and, if it finds no natural
vents, it forces a passage, by elevating and throw∣ing
off the earth above it. In this manner vol∣cano's
commence, and their effects continue in
proportion to the quantity of inflammable mat∣ter
they contain. When the quantity of in∣flamed
matter is inconsiderable, it produces only
an earthquake, and exhibits no marks of a vol∣cano:
The air generated by subterraneous fire
may also escape through small fissures; and, in
this case, likewise, it will be attended with a suc∣cussion
of the earth; but no volcano will appear.
But, when the quantity of inflamed matter is
great, and when it is confined on all sides by so∣lid
and compact bodies, an earthquake and a
volcano are the necessary consequences. But all
these commotions constitute only the first species
of earthquakes, which are not felt but in the
neighbourhood of the places where they hap∣pen.
A violent eruption of Aetna, for example,
will shake all the island of Sicily; but it will
never extend to the distance of three or four
hundred leagues. When Vesuvius bursts open
a new mouth, it excites an earthquake in Naples
and in the neighbourhood of the volcano; but
these earthquakes never shake the Alps; nor do
they extend to France or other countries distant
from Vesuvius. Thus, earthquakes produced
<PB N="434" REF="469"/>
by volcano's are limited to a small space; they
are nothing but effects of the reaction of the fire,
and they shake the earth in the same manner as
the explosion of a powder-magazine occasions
an agitation to the distance of several leagues.</P>
<P>But there is another species of earthquakes,
which are very different in their effects, and per∣haps
also in their cause. These earthquakes
are felt at great distances, and shake a long tract
of ground, without the intervention either of a
new volcano, or of eruptions in those that al∣ready
exist. There are instances of earthquakes
which have been felt at the same time in Britain,
in France, in Germany, and in Hungary. These
earthquakes always extend more in length than
in breadth. They shake a zone or belt of earth
with greater or less violence in different places;
and they are generally accompanied with a hol∣low
noise, like that of a heavy carriage rolling
with rapidity.</P>
<P>As to the causes of this species of earthquake,
it must be remarked, that the explosion of all
inflammable substances, like that of gun-powder,
generates a great quantity of air; that this air
is highly rarified by the heat; and that its effects,
from the compression it receives by being con∣sined
in the bowels of the earth, must be exceed∣ingly
violent. Let us suppose, that, at the depth
of 100 or 200 fathoms, there are a vast collec∣tion
of pyrites and sulphureous bodies, and that
they are inflamed by the fermentation pro∣duced
<PB N="435" REF="470"/>
by the admission of water to them, or by
other causes. What must be the effect? In the
first place, those substances are not placed in
horizontal beds, like the antient strata, which
were formed by the sediments of the waters;
they are lodged, on the contrary, in the
perpendicular fissures, in subterraneous caverns,
and other places, to which the water has ac∣cess.
When inflamed, they generate a vast
quantity of air, the spring of which, by be∣ing
compressed in a small space, like that of a
cavern, will not shake the earth immediately a∣bove,
but it will search for passages in order to
expand and make its escape. Caverns, and the
channels of subterraneous rivulets and springs,
are the only natural passages for this rarified air.
Into these, therefore, it will rush with impetuo∣sity,
and produce in them a furious wind, the
noise of which will be heard on the surface; and
it will be attended with vibrations or succussions
of the ground. This subterraneous wind pro∣duced
by fire, will extend the whole length of
the caverns or channels, and occasion a shaking,
more or less violent, in proportion to its distance
from the heat, and to the width or narrowness
of the canals. But this motion must necessarily
run in a longitudinal direction; and the shaking,
of course, must be felt over a long belt of ground.
This air, however, cannot produce an eruption
or a volcano; because it finds sufficient room
for expanding itself, and diminishing its force;
or rather, because it escapes through fissures in
<PB N="436" REF="471"/>
the form of vapour or of wind. But, although
the existence of caverns or channels for the pas∣sage
of this rarified air should be denied, it is
easy to conceive, that, in the very place where
the explosion is made, as the earth is elevated to
a considerable height, the neighbouring places
must split horizontally in attempting to yield to
the impulse communicated by the original mo∣tion;
and, in this manner, passages may be gra∣dually
and successively opened, so as to commu∣nicate
with very distant places. This explica∣tion
corresponds with all the phaenomena. Earth∣quakes
are not felt at great distances at the same
minute, or even the same hour. They are not
accompanied with eruptions or external fire;
and the noise almost constantly marks the pro∣gressive
motion of this subterraneous wind. O∣ther
facts concur in establishing this theory.
Blasts of wind, and vapours, sometimes of a suf∣focating
nature, it is well known, arise from
mines, independent of the motion in the air pro∣duced
by the current of water. It is equally
well known, that winds issue from certain aper∣tures
of the earth, from caverns, abysses, and
deep lakes, as lake Boleslaw in Bohemia, which
we have formerly mentioned.</P>
<P>When these remarks are considered, I cannot
comprehend how the mountains should have o∣riginated
from earthquakes, since the mineral
and sulphureous bodies which occasion them
are seldom to be met with but in the perpendicu∣lar
<PB N="437" REF="472"/>
fissures of mountains, and in other cavities of
the earth, the greatest number of which have
been produced by the operation of water; since
those inflammable substances produce only a mo∣mentary
explosion, and violent winds which fol∣low
the channels of subterraneous waters; since
the duration of earthquakes on the surface of the
earth is so short, they must be occasioned by a
sudden explosion, and not by a continued con∣flagration;
and, <HI>lastly,</HI> since those earthquakes,
which extend over large tracts of ground, never
produce the smallest eminence throughout their
whole course.</P>
<P>Earthquakes, it is true, are more frequent in
the neighbourhood of volcano's, as in Sicily, and
the environs of Vesuvius: But it appears, from
repeated observation, that these earthquakes are
very limited, and, consequently, can never form
a chain of mountains.</P>
<P>It has sometimes been remarked, that the
matters ejected from Aetna, after cooling for se∣veral
years, and being afterwards moistened with
rain, have rekindled, and thrown out flames with
such violent explosions, as to occasion small
earthquakes.</P>
<P>In 1669, during a violent eruption of Etna,
which began on the 11th of March, the summit
of the mountain sunk considerably<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Phil. Trans. abridg. vol. 2. p 387.</NOTE>; which is
a proof that this volcano proceeds rather from
the superior part of the mountain than from
the bottom of it. Borelli, who is of the same
<PB N="438" REF="473"/>
opinion, observes, 'That the fire of a volcano
proceeds neither from the centre, nor from the
bottom of a mountain, but from the top; and
that the inflammation never kindles but at a
small depth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Borelli de incendiis montis Aetnae.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>Mount Vesuvius has frequently thrown out,
during eruptions, great quantities of boiling wa∣ter.
Mr Ray, who imagines that the fire of
volcano's comes from a very great depth, says,
that this water proceeds from the sea, which com∣municates,
by subterraneous passages, with the
foot of the mountain. As a proof, he mentions
the remarkable dryness of the top of Vesuvius,
and the agitation of the sea during eruptions,
which sometimes recedes so far as to leave the
port of Naples entirely dry. But, supposing
these facts to be true, they by no means prove
that the fire of volcano's proceeds from a great
depth; for the water they eject is certainly rain∣water,
which penetrates through the fissures, and
collects in the cavities of the mountain. Rills
and springs issue from the tops of volcano's as
well as from other high mountains; and, as the
former are hollow, and have suffered more con∣cussions
than the latter, nothing can be more na∣tural
than they should collect water in their ca∣verns,
and that these waters should sometimes
be ejected, along with other substances, in the
time of eruptions. With regard to the motion
of the sea, it arises solely from the shock com∣municated
<PB N="439" REF="474"/>
to the waters by the explosion, which
makes it advance or retire according to different
circumstances.</P>
<P>The most common substances thrown out by
volcano's, are torrents of melted minerals, which
overflow the environs of the mountain. These
rivers of lava extend to great distances; and, in
cooling, they form beds, either horizontal or in∣clined,
in the same manner as the strata accumu∣lated
by successive sediments from water; but
the former are easily distinguishable from the
latter: 1. Because strata of lava are not every
where equal in thickness. 2. Because they con∣tain
nothing that has not evidently been cal∣cined,
vitrified, or melted. 3. Because their
extent is more limited. As there is a vast num∣ber
of volcano's in Peru, and, as the bottoms of
most of the Cordeliers are covered with substan∣ces
that have been thrown out by eruptions, it
is not surprising that no sea-shells have been
found there; for they must have been calcined
and destroyed by the fire. But I am still per∣suaded,
that, if the clay ground, which, accor∣ding
to M. Bourguet, is the ordinary earth in the
valley of Quito, had been dug, shells would have
been discovered there, as well as every where
else, especially where the ground is not covered,
like the bottoms of the mountains, with matters
ejected from volcano's.</P>
<P>It has often been asked, Why all volcano's
appear only on high mountains? I have partly
<PB N="440" REF="475"/>
solved this question in the preceding article.
But, before finishing the present subject, I shall
endeavour more fully to explain myself.</P>
<P>The peaks or points of mountains were ori∣ginally
covered with earth and sand, which, af∣ter
being gradually washed down to the vallies
by the rains, left nothing but those bare rocks
or stones called the core of mountains, which,
being likewise subjected to the action of the
weather, small and large fragments of them must
have been occasionally loosened, and, of course,
must have rolled down to the plains. The rocks
at the base of the summit being fully uncovered,
and having lost their original support from the
sand and earth, would necessarily give way a
little, and, by separating from each other, would
produce small intervals. But this yielding of
the lower rocks could not take place without
rending those that lay above them. In this man∣ner
the core of the mountain, from the summit
to the base of the lower rocks, would be split
into an infinite number of perpendicular fissures
of different dimensions. Through these the rains
would penetrate and carry along with them, into
the bowels of the mountain, all the minerals, and
other substances which they were capable of
transporting or dissolving. Here pyrites, sul∣phur,
and other combustible substances, would be
produced; and, in the course of time, these bo∣dies
would accumulate in great quantities, and,
by their fermentation, would give rise to explo∣sions
<PB N="441" REF="476"/>
and other effects of volcano's. Heaps of
these mineral substances might likewise exist in
the heart of the mountain, before the rain could
penetrate so deep. In this case, as soon as the
air or rain got access to them by means of the
perpendicular fissures, a conflagration and vol∣cano
would instantly take place. No such phae∣nomena
can be exhibited in plains; for, as every
thing there is at rest, and nothing can be dis∣placed,
it is not surprising that the existence of
volcano's should be confined entirely to the
mountains.</P>
<P>When coal-mines are opened, which are com∣monly
found in clay-grounds, and at a great
depth, the mineral substances above mentioned
sometimes kindle into flames. There are ex∣amples
in Scotland, Flanders, &amp;c. of coal-mines
which have continued to burn for many years.
The admission of air is alone sufficient to pro∣duce
this effect. But these inflammations occa∣sion
only slight explosions, and never form vol∣cano's;
because, in such places, all being plain
and solid, the fire cannot be excited to such a
degree as in burning mountains, which are full
of caverns and cliffs, through which the air pe∣netrates,
and augments the action of the fire so
forcibly, as to give rise to the terrible effects we
have been describing.</P>

<HEAD>PROOFS

THEORY OF THE EARTH.</HEAD>
<HEAD>ARTICLE XVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of new Islands, Caverns, perpendicular Fissures,
&amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>NEW islands are either produced suddenly
by the operation of subterraneous fires,
or slowly by the accumulated sediments of wa∣ter.
Upon this subject we are furnished with
indubitable facts, both by antient historians, and
by modern voyagers. Seneca tells us, that, in
his time, the island of Therasia<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Now called Santorini.</NOTE> suddenly emer∣ged
from the sea, to the astonishment of many
spectators. Pliny relates, that 13 islands former∣ly
arose all at once from the bosom of the Me∣diterranean,
and that Rhodes and Delos are the
chief of them. According to Ammianus Mar∣cellinus,
Philo, Pliny, &amp;c. these 13 islands were
<PB N="443" REF="478"/>
not formed by an earthquake or by a subterra∣neous
explosion, but were formerly concealed
under the water, which sunk and uncovered
them. Delos was even distinguished by the
name of Pelagia, because it formerly belonged
to the sea. Whether these 13 new islands were
produced by the action of subterraneous fire, or
by any other cause which diminished the quan∣tity
of water in the Meditterranen, it is not ea∣sy
to determine. But we are informed by Pli∣ny
himself, that the island of Hiera, in the neigh∣bourhood
of Therasia, is composed of ferrugi∣nous
masses, and of earth which had been thrown
up from the bottom of the sea; and, in another
place, he mentions several other islands which
had been formed in the same manner. Upon
this subject, however, we have facts more re∣cent,
and less involved in obscurity.</P>
<P>On the 23d day of May 1707, at sun-rising,
there appeared, at the distance of two or three
miles from the island of Therasia or Santorini,
something which had the resemblance of a float∣ing
rock. Some men, stimulated by curiosity,
approached it, and discovered that it had arisen
from the bottom of the sea; that it increased
under their feet; that oisters and other shells still
adhered to the rocks; and that many pumice∣stones
lay on its surface. Two days before this
rock appeared, there had been a slight earthquake
in Santorini. This island continued to augment
considerably, without any accident, till the 14th
<PB N="444" REF="479"/>
of June; it was then about half a mile in cir∣cumference,
and 20 or 30 feet high, and the
earth was white, and mixed with clay. After
this, the sea began to be more and more agita∣ted;
vapours arose from it which infested the
island of Santorini, and, on the 16th of July,
17 or 18 rocks rose all at once from the bottom
of the sea, and united into one mass. These
phaenomena were attended with a frightful noise,
which continued two months; and flames issu∣ed
from the new island, which still augmented
both in circumference and height; and the ex∣plosions
were so violent, that they drove large
stones to more than 7 miles distance. The island
of Santorini itself was regarded by the antients
as a recent production; and, in 726, 1427, and
1573, it received considerable additions, beside
the small islands formed in its neighbourhood<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See l'hist. de l'acad, des sciences, 1708. p. 23.</NOTE>.
The same volcano, which, in the days of Seneca,
raised the island of Santorini, produced, in Pli∣ny's
time, that of Hiera or Volcanella, and, in
our days, the rock above described.</P>
<P>On the 10th of October 1720, a great fire
was seen to arise from the sea near the island of
Tercera. Navigators being sent, by order of go∣vernment,
to examine it, they perceived, on the
19th of the same month, an island, consisting
of fire and smoke; and a prodigious quantity of
ashes, thrown to a great distance, as from a vol∣cano,
accompanied with a noise similar to that
<PB N="445" REF="480"/>
of thunder. The earth was also perceived to
shake in the neighbourhood; and a vast number
of pumice-stones were found floating on the
sea all round the new island: This last phaeno∣menon
has sometimes been remarked in the o∣pen
sea<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See philosophical transact. abridg. vol. 6. part 2, p. 154.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The historian of the French academy<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ann. 1721, p. 26.</NOTE>, in
narrating this event, remarks, that, after an
earthquake in the island of St Michael, one of
the Azores, there appeared a torrent of fire be∣tween
this island and that of Tercera, which
gave rise to two new rocks: And, in the sub∣sequent
year, the same historian gives the fol∣lowing
detail:</P>
<P>'M. de l'Isle has informed the academy of
several particulars concerning the new island
among the Azores, which he received in a
letter from M. de Montagnac consul at Lis∣bon.
On the 18th of September 1721, M. de
Montagnac's vessel was moored off the fortress
of St Michael; and he learned the following
particulars from the pilot of the port.'</P>
<P>'During the night of the 7th or 8th of De∣cember
1720, there was a great earthquake in
Tercera and St Michael, which islands are di∣stant
from each other about 28 leagues, and a
new island rose from the sea. It was, at the
same time, remarked, that the point of the
island of Peak, at the distance of 30 leagues,
<PB N="446" REF="481"/>
which formerly threw out flames, was extin∣guished.
But a continual thick smoke issued from
the new island, which was distinctly perceived
by M. de Montagnac, as long as he continued
in that part. The pilot assured him, that he
had sailed round the island, and approached
it as near as he could with safety. He sound∣ed
on the south side of it with a rope of 60
fathoms; but found no bottom. On the west
side, the water was much changed: It ap∣peared
to be mixed with white, blue, and
green; and, at the distance of two miles, it
seemed to be shallow and boiling. On the
north-west, the side from which the smoke
issued, he found, at 15 fathoms, a bottom of
coarse sand. He threw a stone into the sea,
and, at the place where it fell, he observed the
water boil, and mount into the air with great
impetuosity. The bottom was so hot, that, at
two different times, it melted a piece of suet
which had been fastened to the end of the
plumb-line. The pilot likewise remarked,
that smoke issued from a small lake, in the
midst of a sandy plain. This island is nearly
round, and high enough to be perceived, in
clear weather, at the distance of seven or eight
leagues.'</P>
<P>'We have since learned, by a letter from M.
Adrien, French consul at St Michael, dated
in March 1722 that the new island is consi∣derably
diminished; that it is nearly on a
<PB N="447" REF="482"/>
level with the water; and that it will probably
soon disappear.'</P>
<P>From these, and many other facts of a similar
nature, it is apparent, that inflammable bodies
exist under the bottom of the sea, and that they
sometimes produce violent explosions. The
places where they happen may be considered as
submarine volcano's, which differ from com∣mon
volcano's only in the shorter duration of
their effects; for, after the fire opens a passage
to itself, the water rushes in, and extinguishes
them. The elevation of new islands neces∣sarily
leaves caverns, which are soon filled by the
waters; and the new ground, which consists of
matter thrown out by the submarine volcano,
must, in every respect, resemble that of the
Monte di Cinere, and other eminences which
have been raised by terrestrial volcano's. It is
on account of the water's rushing into the voids
and fissures produced by explosions, that sub∣marine
volcano's exhibit their effects less fre∣quently
than common volcano's, though both
derive their origin from the same cause.</P>
<P>To subterraneous, or rather submarine fires,
must be ascribed all those ebullitions of the sea,
and water-spouts, which have been remarked in
different places by mariners: They also produce
storms and earthquakes, the effects of which are
equally felt at sea as upon land. The islands
raised by submarine volcano's are generally
composed of pumice-stones and calcined rocks.</P>
<P><PB N="448" REF="483"/>
Fire has frequently been observed to issue out
of the waters of the sea. Pliny tells us, that the
whole surface of the Thrasymen lake has ap∣peared
to be inflamed; and Agricola informs us,
that, when a stone was thrown into the lake of
Denstat in Thuringia, its descent was marked by
a train of fire.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> the great quantities of pumice-stones
discovered by voyagers in different parts of the
ocean, as well as in the Mediterranean, demon∣strate
the existence of volcano's in the bottom
of the sea, which differ not from those upon
land, either in the violence of their explosions,
or in the matter they throw out, but only in
their rarity, and in the shortness of their dura∣tion.
Hence it may be remarked, that the bot∣tom
of the sea every way resembles the surface
of the earth, not admitting even the exception
of volcano's.</P>
<P>Between sea and land volcano's there are
many relations. Both of them exist on the
tops of mountains. The Azore islands, and
those of the Archipelago, are only the points
of mountains, some of which are above, and
others under, the surface of the water. From
the account of the new islands among the A∣zores,
it appears, that the place where the smoke
issued was only 15 fathoms deep, which, when
compared with the ordinary depth of the ocean,
demonstrates this place to be the top of a pretty
high mountain. The same remark may be
<PB N="449" REF="484"/>
made with regard to the new island near Santo∣rini.
Its depth must have been inconsiderable,
since oisters were found attached to the rocks
which rose above the surface of the water. It
likewise appears, that sea-volcano's, as well as
those upon land, have subterraneous communi∣cations;
for, at the very time that the new
island among the Azores arose, the summit of
the volcano of St George, in the island of Peak,
sunk. It also merits observation, that new
islands never appear but in the neighbourhood
of old ones; and that there are no examples of
new islands in open seas: They ought, there∣fore,
to be regarded as continuations of the an∣tient
islands; and, when volcano's happen to
exist in the latter, it is not surprising that the for∣mer
should contain the same materials, which
may be kindled either by fermentation alone,
or by the action of subterraneous winds.</P>
<P>Besides, new islands produced by earthquakes,
or by subterraneous fires, are few in number.
But the number of those formed by slime, sand,
and earth, transported by rivers, or by the mo∣tions
of the sea, is almost infinite. At the
mouths of rivers, such quantities of earth and
sand are amassed, as frequently give rise to
islands of considerable extent. The sea, by re∣tiring
from certain coasts, leaves uncovered the
highest parts of the bottom, and these parts con∣stitute
so many new islands. In the same man∣ner,
when the sea encroaches upon the land, it
<PB N="450" REF="485"/>
covers the plains, and the more elevated grounds
appear in the form of islands. It is for this rea∣son
that there are few islands in the open seas,
and that they are so numerous near the coasts.</P>
<P>Fire and water, though of very opposite na∣tures,
exhibit many effects so similar, that the
one may often be mistaken for the other. Be∣side
the productions peculiar to these elements,
as chrystal, glass, &amp;c. they give rise to many
great phaenomena, which have such strong re∣semblances,
that they can hardly be distinguish∣ed.
Water, as we have seen, elevates moun∣tains,
and forms the greatest number of islands:
Some mountains and islands likewise derive their
origin from fire. The same observation applies
to caverns, fissures, gulfs, &amp;c. Some of them
are the effects of fire, and others of water.</P>
<P>Caverns are, in a great measure, peculiar to
mountains: They are seldom or never found in
plains. They are frequent in the Archipelago,
and other islands; because islands are generally
nothing but the tops of mountains. Caverns,
like precipices, are formed by the sinking or
mouldering of rocks, or, like abysses, by the
action of fire; for, to make a cavern form a
precipice or an abyss, nothing farther is neces∣sary
than that the tops of the opposite rocks
should come together and form an arch, which
must frequently happen when they are loosened
at the root, and shaken by earthquakes, or by
the operation of time and of the weather. Ca∣verns
<PB N="451" REF="486"/>
may be produced by the same causes which
give rise to gulfs, apertures, or sinkings of the
earth; and these causes are explosions of vol∣cano's,
the action of subterraneous vapours, and
earthquakes, which create such commotions in
the earth as must necessarily produce caverns,
fissures, and hollows of every kind.</P>
<P>The cavern of St Patrick in Ireland is not so
considerable as it is famous: The same remark
may be made with regard to the Grotto del Cane
in Italy, and to that of Mount Beni-guazeval, in
the kingdom of Fez, which throws out fire.
There is a very large cavern in the county of
Derby in England. It is much larger than the
celebrated cavern of Bauman, near the Black
Forest of Brunswick. I was informed by the
Earl of Morton, a philosopher more respectable
for his merit than his high rank, that the en∣trance
to this cavern, called the <HI>Devil's hole,</HI>
is larger than the door of any church; that a
small river runs through it; that, after advan∣cing
some way, the vault of the cavern sinks
down so low, that, in order to proceed farther,
it is necessary to lie flat in a boat, and to be
pushed through this narrow passage by people
accustomed to the business; and that, after get∣ting
through, the roof, or arch of the cavern,
rises to a great height; and, after walking a con∣siderable
way on the side of the river, the arch
sinks again so low as to touch the surface of the
water. Here the cavern terminates. The river,
<PB N="452" REF="487"/>
which seems to have its source in this part of
the cavern, swells occasionally, and transports
heaps of sand, which, by accumulating, forms a
kind of blind alley, whose direction is different
from that of the principal cavern.</P>
<P>In Carniola, near Potpechio, there is a large
cavern, in which is a pretty considerable lake.
Near Adelsperg, we meet with a cavern in which
a man may travel two German miles. It contains
several tremendous and deep precipices<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Acta erud. Lips. anno 1689, p. 558.</NOTE>. The
Mendip hills in Somerset-shire likewise present us
with extensive caverns, and very fine grottos.
Near these caverns we find veins of lead, and
sometimes large oak-trees, buried 15 fathoms
deep. In the county of Gloucester, there is a
large cavern called <HI>Pen-park-hole,</HI> at the bottom
of which we meet with 32 fathoms of water.
Here we also find veins of lead.</P>
<P>It is apparent, that the Devil's-hole, and o∣ther
caverns, from which issue large springs or
brooks, have been gradually formed by the ope∣ration
of the water, and their origin cannot be
ascribed to earthquakes or volcano's.</P>
<P>One of the largest and most singular caverns
we are acquainted with, is that of Antiparos, of
which M. Tournefort has given a complete de∣scription.
We first find a rustic cave about 30
feet wide, divided by some natural pillars. Be∣tween
two pillars on the right, the ground slops
gently, and then more precipitately for about
<PB N="453" REF="488"/>
20 paces to the bottom of the cavern. This is
the passage to the grotto or interior cave, and is
nothing but a dark hole, through which a man
cannot pass without stooping, and the assistance
of lights. We then descend, by means of a
rope fixed at the entrance, a horrible precipice,
and arrive on the very borders of another still
more tremendous, with corresponding abysses on
the left. By a ladder placed on the margin of
these gulphs, we get over a vast perpendicular
rock. We then continue to slip through places
less dangerous. But, when we think ourselves
in the greatest safety, we are suddenly stopped
by a frightful pass; to escape through which,
we are obliged to glide on our backs along a
large rock, and to descend by means of a ladder.
When we arrive at the bottom of the ladder, we
stumble for some time among irregular rocks,
and then the famous grotto presents itself. This
grotto is about 300 fathoms below the surface
of the earth, and it appears to be about 40 fa∣thoms
high, and 50 wide. It is full of large
and beautiful stalactites, which both depend from
the roof of the vault and cover the floor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Tournefort's voyage to the Levant.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In that part of Greece called Achaia by the
antients, now Livadia, there is a large cavern in
a mountain which was formerly famous for the
oracles of Trophonius: It is situated between the
Lake of Livadia and the sea, from which, at the
nearest part, it is distant about four miles; and
<PB N="454" REF="489"/>
there are no less than 40 subterraneous passages
through which the waters run under the moun∣tain<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Gordon's Geography, p. 179.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In all countries that are subject to earthquakes
or volcano's, caverns are frequent. The structure
of most of the islands of the Archipelago is ex∣ceedingly
cavernous. The islands in the Indian
ocean, and particularly the Moluccas, appear to
be chiefly supported upon vaults. The land of
the Azores, of the Canaries, of the Cape de
Verd islands, and, in general, of almost all small
islands, is, in many places, hollow and full of
caverns; because these islands, as formerly re∣marked,
are only the tops of mountains, which
have suffered great convulsions either from vol∣cano's,
or by the action of the waters, of frosts,
and of other injuries of the weather. In the
Cordelieres, where volcano's and earthquakes are
frequent, there are many caverns, precipices,
and abysses.</P>
<P>The famous labyrinth in the island of Crete
is not the work of nature alone. We are assured
by M. Tournefort, that, in many parts of it, the
operation of men is evident; and, it is probable,
that this is not the only cavern which has been
augmented by art. Mines and quarries are con∣stantly
digging; and, after these have been long
deserted, it is not easy to determine whether
such excavations have been the effects of nature
or of art. Some quarries are amazingly exten∣sive.
<PB N="455" REF="490"/>
That of Maestricht, for instance, is suffi∣cient
to shelter 50,000 men, and is supported by
more than 1000 pillars of 20 feet high; and the
earth and rock above is 25 fathoms thick<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Phil. Trans. abridg. vol. 2. p. 463.</NOTE>. The
salt mines of Poland exhibit excavations still
more extensive. Near large cities, quarries and
artificial hollows are common. But, we must
proceed no farther in detail. Besides, the opera∣tions
of men, however great, will always make
but an inconsiderable figure in the history of
nature.</P>
<P>Volcano's and water which form caverns in
the bowels of the earth, produce likewise on its
surface, fissures, precipices, and abysses. At
Cajeta in Italy, there is a mountain which had
been formerly split by an earthquake in such a
manner, that the separation seems to have been
made by the hands of men. We have already
mentioned the <HI>Wheel-track,</HI> or great fissure in
the island of Machian, the abyss of Mount Ara∣rat,
the port or gap in the Cordelieres, that of
Thermopylae, &amp;c. To these we might add the
gap in the mountain of the Troglodites in Arabia,
and that of the <HI>Ladders</HI> in Savoy, which was
begun by nature, and finished by Victor-Ama∣daeus.
Considerable sinkings in the earth, the
fall of rocks, and the subversion of mountains,
are frequently produced by the waters, as well
as by subterraneous fires. Of this many ex∣amples
might be given.</P>
<P><PB N="456" REF="491"/>
'In the month of June 1714, a part of the
mountain of Diableret in Valois fell sudden∣ly,
and, in a few hours, the sky being serene,
it appeared to have assumed a conical figure.
It destroyed 55 houses, besides several men, and
a great many cattle; and it covered a league
square with its ruins. The sky was darkened
with the dust; the collection of stones and
earth that were amassed on the plain, exceeded
30 Rhenish perches in height, dammed up the
waters, and gave rise to new lakes of conside∣rable
depths. But this phaenomenon was not
accompanied with the least vestige of bitumen,
sulphur, or calcined lime-stone; nor, conse∣quently,
of subterraneous fire: The base of
this great rock appeared to be rotten, and re∣duced
to powder<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. de l'Acad. des Sciences, anneé 1715, p. 4.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>There is a remarkable example of these sink∣ings
near Folkstone in the county of Kent. The
hills in the neighbourhood sunk insensibly, with∣out
any earthquake or other commotion. The
interior parts of these hills consist of rocks and
chalk; and, by their sinking, they have pushed
part of the adjacent land into the sea. A well
attested relation of this fact may be seen in the
Philosophical Transactions<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Abridg. vol. 4. p. 250.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In 1618, the town of Pleurs was buried un∣der
the rocks at the foot of which it had been
situated. In 1678, a great inundation was oc∣casioned,
<PB N="457" REF="492"/>
in Gascony, by the sinking of some
portions of one of the Pyrenees, which forced
out the water that had been pent up in the sub∣terraneous
caverns of these mountains. In the
year 1680, a still greater inundation was pro∣duced
in Ireland, by the sinking of a mountain
into caverns that had been full of water. It is
not difficult to investigate the cause of these ef∣fects.
It is well known, that subterraneous wa∣ters
are every where frequent. These waters
gradually work away sand and earth in their
passages; and, consequently, they may, in the
course of time, destroy the stratum of earth
which serves as a basis to the mountain: If this
stratum fail more on one side than on another,
the mountain must, of necessity, be overturned;
or, if the base wastes gradually and equally
throughout, the mountain will sink, without be∣ing
overturned.</P>
<P>Having mentioned a few of those convulsions
and changes produced in the earth by what may
be called the accidents of nature, we must not
pass over in silence the perpendicular fissures in
the different strata. These fissures are obvious,
not only in all rocks and quarries, but in clays,
and in every species of earth which has never
been removed from its natural position. They
are called perpendicular fissures; because, like the
horizontal strata, they are never oblique, but
from some accidental change. Woodward and
Ray talk of fissures, but in a general and confused
<PB N="458" REF="493"/>
manner, and they never mention them under
the appellation of perpendicular fissures, because
they imagined that they might be indifferently
either oblique or perpendicular. No author has
hitherto attempted to explain their origin, though
it is apparent, as remarked in a former article,
that they have been occasioned by the drying of
the materials which compose the horizontal stra∣ta.
In whatever manner this drying should hap∣pen,
perpendicular fissures must have been a ne∣cessary
consequence of it; for the matter of the
horizontal strata could not be diminished in size,
without splitting, at different distances, in a di∣rection
perpendicular to the strata themselves.
Under perpendicular fissures, I comprehend, not
only the natural cracks in rocks, but all those
separations which have been effected by convul∣sive
accidents. When a mass of rocks have suf∣ered
any considerable motion, the fissures are
sometimes placed obliquely; but it is because
the mass itself is oblique; and the smallest at∣tention
to quarries of marble and lime-stone, or
to great chains of rocks, will convince us, that
the general direction of fissures is perpendicular
to the strata in which they are found.</P>
<P>The bowels of mountains are chiefly compo∣sed
of parallel strata of stones and rocks. Be∣tween
the parallel strata, we often meet with
beds of matter softer than stone; and the per∣pendicular
fissures are filled with sand, crystals,
metals, &amp;c. The formation of these last bo∣dies
<PB N="459" REF="494"/>
is more recent than that of the horizontal
strata in which sea-shells are found. The rains
have gradually detached the sand and earth from
the tops of mountains, and left the stones and
rocks bare, which affords an opportunity of di∣stinguishing
with ease both the parallel strata and
the perpendicular fissures. On the other hand,
the rains and rivers have successively covered the
plains with considerable quantities of earth, sand,
gravel, and other bodies that are either soluble
in water, or easily divisible by it. Of these have
been formed beds of tufa, of soft stone, of sand,
of rounded gravel, and of earth mixed with ve∣getable
substances. But these beds contain no
sea-shells, or, at most, but fragments of them,
which have been detached from the mountains
along with the earth and gravel. These recent
beds should be carefully distinguished from the
antient and original strata, in which we almost
universally find a great number of entire shells
placed in their natural situation.</P>
<P>In examining the internal order and distribu∣tion
of the materials of a mountain, composed of
common stone or calcinable lapidific matter, we
generally find, after removing the vegetable soil,
a bed of gravel, of the same nature and colour
with the stones that predominate in the moun∣tain;
and, under the gravel, we meet with the
solid rock. When the mountain is cut by a
deep trench or <HI>ravine,</HI> the different banks or
strata are easily distinguishable. Each horizon∣tal
<PB N="460" REF="495"/>
stratum is separated by a kind of joint or fu∣ture,
which is likewise horizontal. These strata
generally augment in thickness, in proportion to
their depth or distance from the top of the
mountain; and they are all divided, vertically,
by perpendicular fissures. In general, the first
stratum under the gravel, and even the second,
are not only thinner than those which form the
base of the mountain, but so much cut by per∣pendicular
fissures, that only small portions of
them have any coherence. Most of these fis∣sures,
which exactly resemble the cracks in
earth that has been dried, gradually disappear as
they descend, and, at the base of the mountain,
where they cut the larger strata in a more regu∣lar
and more perpendicular manner than those
near the surface, their number is much smaller.</P>
<P>These strata of rock often extend, without in∣terruption,
to great distances. Stones of the
same species likewise are almost uniformly found
in opposite mountains, whether they be sepa∣rated
by a narrow neck or a valley; and the
strata never entirely disappear, unless when the
mountain terminates in a large and level plain.
Sometimes we find, between the vegetable soil
and the gravel, a stratum of marle, which com∣municates
its colour, and other qualities, to the
neighbouring beds: The perpendicular fissures
in the inferior rocks are, in this case, filled with
marle, where it acquires a hardness equal, in ap∣pearance,
to that of the surrounding stone; but,
<PB N="461" REF="496"/>
when exposed to the air, it splits, and becomes
soft and ductile.</P>
<P>The beds of stone which compose the top of
the mountains are generally soft and tender, but
those near the base are exceedingly hard. The
first is commonly white, and of a grain so fine
as to be hardly perceptible. In proportion as
they descend, the rocks become more compact,
and have a better grain; and the lowest beds are
not only harder than the superior ones, but are
also more compact and more heavy. Their
grain is fine and brilliant; and they are often
so brittle as to break as purely and neatly as
flint.</P>
<P>The heart of a mountain, then, is composed
of different strata of stones, which are harder or
softer in proportion to their distance from the
summit; and they are broad at the base, and
sharp and narrow at the top. The last is, in∣deed,
a necessary result of the first: For, as the
stones grow harder as they descend, it is natural
to think, that the currents, and other motions of
the water, which scooped out the vallies, and
formed the contours of the mountains, must
have gradually consumed, by their lateral fric∣tion,
the materials of which the mountains are
composed; and that this consumption would be
proportioned to the hardness or softness of the
matter acted upon. But, as the upper strata are
known to be softest, and as their density increases
according as they approach the base, the moun∣tains
<PB N="462" REF="497"/>
must, of necessity, have assumed their pre∣sent
inclined, and somewhat conical figure.
This is one great cause of the declivity of
mountains; and it must always become more
gentle, in proportion as the earth and gravel are
brought down by the rain from their summits.
For these reasons it is that the declivity of hills
and mountains, composed of calcinable bodies, is
less than that of those which consist of granite,
or of flint, in large masses. The latter generally
rise almost perpendicularly to very great heights;
because, in these masses of vitrifiable matter, the
superior, as well as the inferior strata, are ex∣tremely
hard, and have presented nearly an equal
resistance to the operation of the waters.</P>
<P>Though, in the tops of some hills which are
flat, and pretty extensive, we find hard stone
immediately under the vegetable soil; yet it
should be remarked, that, in every example of
this kind, what appears to be the summit of a
hill is only a continuation of some more eleva∣ted
hill in the neighbourhood, the upper strata of
which consist of soft, and the inferior strata of
hard stone; and the hard stone found on the
top of the first hill is only a continuation of the
under strata of the higher hill.</P>
<P>Still, however, on the tops of hills which are
not surmounted by higher grounds, the stone
is mostly of a soft and friable nature; and hard
stone cannot be had without digging to a consi∣derable
depth. It is between these layers of
<PB N="463" REF="498"/>
hard stone only that marble is to be found; and
it is variegated with different colours by metalic
substances carried down by rain-water, and fil∣trated
through the strata: And it is probable
that, in every country which furnishes stones,
marble would be found, if pits were dug to a
sufficient depth: <HI>Quoto enim,</HI> says Pliny, <HI>loco non
suum marmor invenitur?</HI> It is, in fact, a more
common stone than is generally imagined, and
dissers from other stones only in the fineness of
its grain, which renders it compact, and suscep∣tible
of a fine and brilliant polish.</P>
<P>Both the perpendicular fissures, and the hori∣zontal
joints of quarries, are often filled, or en∣crusted,
with concretions, which are sometimes
transparent, and of regular figures, as crystals,
and sometimes earthy and opaque. Water runs
through the perpendicular fissures, and even
penetrates the close texture of the stone itself.
Stones that are porous imbibe water so copiously,
that frost splits them in pieces. The rain-waters,
by filtrating through different strata, are impreg∣nated
with a great variety of substances. They
first sink through the perpendicular fissures; they
then penetrate the strata of stone, and deposite
in the horizontal joints, as well as in the per∣pendicular
fissures, such matter as they collect
in their course, and give rise to different concre∣tions,
according to the nature of these substan∣ces.
For example, when the water filtrates
through marle, clay, or soft stone, the matter
<PB N="464" REF="499"/>
which it deposites is nothing but a fine pure
marle, and commonly appears in the perpendi∣cular
fissures under the form of a porous, soft,
white, light substance, known among natura∣lists
under the name of <HI>Lac Lunae, or Medulla
Saxi.</HI></P>
<P>When veins of water, charged with stoney
matter, run along the horizontal joints of soft
stone or chalk, this matter adheres to the surface
of the stones, and forms a white, scaly, light,
and spongy crust, which, from its resemblance
to the agaric, has been called <HI>mineral agaric.</HI> But,
if the strata through which the water penetrates
be hard stone, the filter being closer, the water
it lets pass will be impregnated with a stoney
matter more pure and homogeneous; and, conse∣quently,
the particles being capable of a more
compact and intimate union, will form concre∣tions
nearly of equal density with the stone it∣self,
and somewhat transparent. In quarries of
this kind, the surface of the stones are encrusted
with undulated concretions, which entirely fill
up the horizontal joints.</P>
<P>In grottos and cavities of rocks, which may
be regarded as the basins or common sewers of
the perpendicular fissures, the different directions
of the veins of water give different forms to the
concretions which result from them. These
forms are generally wreathed, or resemble an in∣verted
cone, attached to the roof of the cavern;
or, rather, they are white, hollow cylinders, com∣posed
<PB N="465" REF="500"/>
of concentric coats. The impregnated
waters sometimes fall in drops upon the floor of
the cavern, and form columns, and a thousand
whimsical figures, to which naturalists have
given the different appellations of <HI>stalactites,</HI>
<HI>stelegmites, osteocollae,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> when the concreting juices issue im∣mediately
from marble, or very hard stone, the
lapidific matter is rather dissolved than suspended
in the water, and it forms a kind of columns
with triangular points, which are transparent,
and consist of oblique coats. This substance is
distinguished by the name of <HI>spar</HI> or <HI>spalt.</HI> It is
transparent and colourless, excepting when the
stone or marble through which it filtrates con∣tains
metallic particles. This spar is of equal
hardness with the stone itself, and it dissolves in
acids, and calcines with the same degree of heat.
Hence it is evident, that spar is a true stone, and
perfectly homogeneous. It may even be said
to be pure and elementary stone.</P>
<P>Most naturalists, however, consider this as a
distinct substance, existing independent of stone:
It is the lapidisic or crystalline juice, which, in
their estimation, not only cements the particles
of common stone, but even those of flint. This
juice, they alledge, daily augments the density
of stones by reiterated filtrations, and at last
converts them into flint: When concreted into
spar, it perpetually receives fresh supplies of still
purer juice, which increases both its hardness
<PB N="466" REF="501"/>
and its density, till it changes to the consistence
of glass, then to that of crystal, and at last it is
converted into genuine diamond.</P>
<P>But, on this supposition, Why does the lapi∣dific
juice produce only stone in some provinces,
and nothing but flint in others? It may be said,
that the one province is less antient than the
other, and that the juice has not had time suffi∣cient
to complete its natural operations. But in
this there is not the shadow of probability. Be∣sides,
from whence does this juice proceed? If it
gives rise to stones and flints, from whence does
it derive its own origin? It is obvious, that it
has no existence independent of those substances
which alone can impart to the water that pene∣trates
them a petrifying quality, which uniform∣ly
corresponds with their nature and peculiar
properties. Thus, when it filtrates through
stone, it produces spar; when it issues from flint,
it forms crystal; and there are as many species
of this juice as of bodies from which it proceeds.
Experience confirms this account of the matter.
The waters which filtrate through quarries of
common stone form tender and calcinable con∣cretions
similar to the stones themselves. On
the other hand, the waters which exsude from
granite or from flint, produce concretions hard
and vitrifiable, and they have all the other pro∣perties
of flint, as the former had all those of
stone. In the same manner, the waters that fil∣trate
through mineral and metallic substances,
<PB N="467" REF="502"/>
give rise to pyrites, marcasites, and metallic
grains.</P>
<P>It was formerly remarked, that all matter
might be divided into the two great classes of
Vitrifiable and Calcinable. Clay and flint, marle
and stone, may be regarded as the two extremes
of each class, the intervals between which are
filled with an almost infinite variety of mixts,
that have always one or other of these substances
for their basis.</P>
<P>The substances belonging to the first class can
never acquire the properties of those of the lat∣ter.
Stone, however antient, will for ever be
equally removed from the nature of flint, as clay
is from that of marle. No known agent can ever
force them from the circle of combinations pe∣culiar
to their nature. Places which produce
marble and stone will always continue to do so
as infallibly as those which produce only sand∣stone,
flint, and granite, will never produce lime∣stone
or marble.</P>
<P>If we examine the order and distribution of
the materials of a hill composed of vitrifiable
substances, we will generally find, under the ve∣getable
soil, a stratum of clay, which is likewise
a vitrifiable substance analogous to flint, and
which, as already remarked, is only a decompo∣sition
of vitrifiable sand; or rather, we will find,
under the soil, a stratum of vitrifiable sand. This
stratum of clay or of sand corresponds with the
bed of gravel in hills consisting of calcinable
<PB N="468" REF="503"/>
matters. Below the stratum of clay or of sand,
we meet with some beds of free-stone, which
seldom exceed half a foot in thickness, and they
are divided into small portions by perpendicular
fissures. Under these are several strata of the
same matter, and likewise beds of vitrifiable
sand. In proportion as we descend, the free∣stone
is more dense, and its thickness increases.
Below these, we find what I call <HI>live-rock,</HI> or
<HI>flint in large masses,</HI> a substance so hard as to re∣sist
the file, and all kinds of acids, more power∣fully
than vitrifiable sand or powder of glass,
upon which aquafortis seems to have some effect.
When struck with another hard body, it throws
out sparks of fire, and exhales a penetrating sul∣phurcous
vapour. This flinty substance is com∣monly
found along with beds of clay, of slate,
of pit-coal, of vitrifiable sand; and it corresponds
to the strata of hard-stone and marble, which
serve as the bases of hills that consist of calci∣nable
matter.</P>
<P>The waters, in passing through the perpendi∣cular
fissures, and in penetrating the strata of
vitrifiable sand, of free-stone, of clay, and of
slate, are impregnated with the finest and most ho∣mogeneous
particles of these substances, and pro∣duce
various concretions, such as tale, asbestus,
and other bodies which owe their existence to
distillation through vitriable matter.</P>
<P>Flint, notwithstanding its hardness and densi∣ty,
has, like marble and common stone, its exu∣dations,
<PB N="469" REF="504"/>
from which result stalactites of different
species, varying in transparency, colour, and con∣figuration,
according to the nature of the flint
that produces them, and to the different metallic
or heterogeneous particles it contains. Rock∣crystal,
all the precious stones, and even the
diamond itself, may be regarded as stalactites of
this kind. The flints in small masses, the strata
or coats of which are generally concentric, are
only stalactites, or parasitical stones, from the
flints in large masses; and most of the fine opaque
stones are nothing but species of flint. The
substances produced by the vitrifiable class of
bodies are not, as we have seen, so various as
the concretions formed by those of the calcinable.
Most of the concretions formed by flint are hard
and precious stones; but those produced by cal∣careous
stones are friable, and of no value.</P>
<P>Perpendicular fissures are found in flint-rocks
as well as in stone; they are even frequently
larger in flint, which proves this substance to be
drier than stone. Both the hill consisting of
calcinable, and that composed of vitrifiable mat∣ter,
have clay or vitrifiable sand for their bases,
which are the most commonly diffused matters
of the globe, and which I regard as the lightest,
being the scoriae of the vitrified matter that con∣stitutes
the interior parts of the earth. Thus all
mountains as well as plains are founded either
on clay or sand. We have seen, for example,
in the pits of Amsterdam, and in that of Marly∣la-ville,
<PB N="470" REF="505"/>
that vitrifiable sand was always the
deepest stratum.</P>
<P>It may be observed, in most bare rocks, that
the walls of perpendicular fissures, whether they
be narrow or wide, correspond as exactly with
each other as split pieces of wood. In the large
quarries of Arabia, which consist mostly of gra∣nite,
the perpendicular fissures are frequent; and,
though some of them are 20 or 30 yards wide,
the sides correspond exactly, and leave a deep
cavity between them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Shaw's Travels.</NOTE>. It is likewise common to
find, in perpendicular fissures, shells divided into
two pieces, each piece remaining attached to the
opposite sides of the fissure; which proves, that
these shells were deposited in the solid stratum
before it was split<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Woodward, p. 298.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In some quarries mentioned by Mr Shaw, the
perpendicular fissures are exceedingly large; and
for this reason, perhaps, it is, that they are less
numerous. In quarries of granite and flint in
large masses, blocks of stone may be raised, as
the obelisks and columns at Rome, of 60, 80,
100, and 150 feet long, without the leas inter∣ruption.
It appears, that these vast blocks have
been raised from the same quarry, and, like some
species of free-stone, that they may be had of
any given thickness. In other substances, the
perpendicular fissures are very narrow, as in clay,
in marle, and in chalk; and they are wider in
<PB N="471" REF="506"/>
marble and hard stone. Some are imperceptible,
because they have been filled with a matter near∣ly
similar to that of the stone itself; but still
they interrupt the continuity of the stones, and
are called <HI>hairs</HI> by the workmen. I have often
remarked, that these hairs in marble and stone
differed from perpendicular fissures only in the
separation of parts not being complete. These
species of fissures are filled with a transparent
matter, which is a true spar. In quarries of
free-stone, the fissures are numerous, and consi∣derably
large, because rocks of this kind have
often a less solid base, than that which supports
marble or lime-stone, the former generally rest∣ing
upon a fine sand, and the latter upon clay.
In many places, free-stone is not to be found in
large masses; and in most quarries, where this
stone is good, the blocks lie irregularly upon one
another, in the form of cubes or parallelopipeds,
as in the hills of Fountainbleau, which appear,
at a distance, like the ruins of old buildings.
This irregular disposition has been occasioned by
the sandy foundation of these hills allowing the
blocks to sink and tumble upon each other, e∣specially
where quarries have been formerly
wrought, which has given rise to a great variety
of fissures and intervals between the different
blocks: And it may be remarked, in all coun∣tries
abounding with sand and free-stone, that
there are many fragments of rocks and large
stones in the middle of the plains and vallies;
<PB N="472" REF="507"/>
and that, on the contrary, in countries abound∣ing
with marble and hard stone, these scattered
fragments, which have rolled down from the
hills, are exceedingly rare. This phaenomenon
is owing to the different solidities of the bases
upon which these stones are supported, and to
the extent of the banks of marble or lime-stone,
which is always more considerable than that of
free-stone.</P>

<HEAD>PROOFS
OF THE
THEORY OF THE EARTH.</HEAD>
<HEAD>ARTICLE XVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the Effects of Rains—Of Marshes, Subter∣raneous
Wood and Waters.</HEAD>
<P>IT has already been remarked, that rains,
and the currents of water which they pro∣duce,
continually detach, from the summits and
sides of the mountains, earth, gravel, &amp;c. and
carry them down to the plains; and that the
rivers transport part of them to the sea. The
plains, therefore, by fresh accumulations of mat∣ter,
are perpetually rising higher; and the moun∣tains,
for the same reason, are constantly dimi∣nishing
both in size and elevation. Of the
sinking of mountains, Joseph Blancanus relates
several facts which were publicly known in his
time. The steeple of the village of Craich, in
the county of Derby, was not visible in 1572,
<PB N="474" REF="509"/>
from a certain mountain, on account of a high∣er
mountain which intervened; but, 80 or
100 years afterwards, not only the steeple, but
likewise part of the church, was visible from the
same station. Dr Plot gives a similar example
of a mountain between Sibbertoft and Ashby, in
the county of Northampton. Sand, earth, gra∣vel,
and small stones, are not only carried down
by the rains, but they sometimes undermine and
drive before them large rocks, which conside∣rably
diminish the height of mountains. In ge∣nera,
the rocks are pointed and perpendicular
in proportion to the height and steepness of
mountains. The rocks in high mountains
are very straight and naked. The large frag∣ments
that appear in the vallies have been de∣tached
by the operation of water and of frosts.
Thus sand and earth are not the only substances
detached from mountains by the rains; they at∣tack
the hardest rocks, and carry down large frag∣ments
of them into the plains. At Nant-phrancon,
in 1685, a part of a large rock, which was sup∣ported
on a narrow base, being undermined by
the waters, fell and split into a number of frag∣ments,
the largest of which made deep trenches
in the plain, crossed a small river, and stopped
at the other side of it. To similar accidents we
must ascribe the origin of all those large stones
which are found in vallies adjacent to moun∣tains.
This phaenomenon, as formerly remark∣ed,
is more common in countries where the
<PB N="475" REF="510"/>
mountains are composed of sand and free-stone,
than in those, the mountains of which consist of
clay and marble; because sand is a less solid basis
than clay.</P>
<P>To give an idea of the quantity of earth de∣tached
from mountains by the rains, we shall
quote a passage on this subject from Dr Plot's
natural history of Stafford. He remarks, that
a great number of coins struck in the reign of
Edward IV. i.e. 200 years ago, were found bu∣ried
18 feet below the surface: Hence, he con∣cludes,
the earth, which is marshy where the
coins were found, augments about a foot in ele∣ven
years, or an inch and a twelfth each year.
A similar observation may be made on trees bu∣ried
17 feet below the surface, under which were
found medals of Julius Caesar. Thus, the soil
of the plains in considerably augmented and ele∣vated
by the matters washed down from the
mountains.</P>
<P>The sand, gravel, and earth carried down from
the mountains into the plains, form beds which
ought not to be confounded with the original
strata of the globe. To the former belong the
beds of tufa, of soft stone, and of sand and gra∣vel
which have been rounded by the operation
of water. To these may be added those beds
of stone which have been formed by a species of
incrustation, none of which derive their ori∣gin
from the motion or sediments of the sea. In
these strata of tufa and of soft imperfect stones,
<PB N="476" REF="511"/>
we find a number of different vegetables, leaves
of trees, land or river-shells, and small terrestri∣al
animals, but never sea-shells, or other produc∣tions
of the ocean. This circumstance, joined
to their want of solidity, evidently proves, that
these strata have been superinduced upon the dry
surface of the earth, and that they are more re∣cent
than those of marble and other stones which
contain sea-shells, and have been originally form∣ed
by the waters of the sea. Tufa, and other
new stones, appear to be hard and solid when
first dug out of the earth; but they soon dissolve
after being exposed to the operation of the wea∣ther.
Their substance is so different from that
of true stone, that, when broken down in order
to make sand of them, they change into a kind
of dirty earth. The stalactites, and other stony
concretions which Mr Tournefort apprehended
to be marbles which had vegetated, are not ge∣nuine
stones. We have already shown, that the
formation of tufa is not antient; and that it is not
entitled to be ranked with stones. Tufa is an im∣perfect
substance, differing from stone or earth,
but deriving its origin from both by the inter∣vention
of rain-water, in the same manner as
incrustations are formed by the waters of certain
springs. Thus, the strata of these substances are
not antient; nor have they, like the other spe∣cies,
been formed by sediments from the waters
of the ocean. The strata of turf are also recent,
and have been produced by successive accumula∣tions
<PB N="477" REF="512"/>
of half corrupted trees and other vegetables.
which owe their preservation to a bituminous
earth. No production of the sea ever appears in
any of these new strata. But, on the contrary,
we find in them many vegetables, the bones of
land-animals, and land and river-shells. In the
meadows near Ashly, in the county of Nort∣hampton,
for example, they find, several feet be∣low
the surface, snail-shells, plants, herbs, and
several species of river-shells, well preserved;
but not a single sea-shell appears<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See phil. trans. abridg. vol. 4. p, 271.</NOTE>. All these
new strata have been formed by the waters on
the surface changing their channels, and diffu∣sing
themselves on all sides. Part of these wa∣ters
penetrate the earth, and run along the fis∣sures
of rocks and stones. The reason why wa∣ter
is seldom found in high countries, or on the
tops of hills, is, because high grounds are gene∣rally
composed of stones and rocks. To find
water, therefore, we must cut through the rocks
till we arrive at clay or firm earth. But, when
the thickness of the rock is great, as in high moun∣tains
where the rocks are often 1000 feet high,
it is impossible to pierce them to their base; and
consequently it is impossible to find water in such
situations. There are even extensive countries
that afford no water, as in Arabia Petrea, which is
a desert where no rains fall, where the surface of
the earth is covered with burning sands, where
there is hardly the appearance of any soil, and
where nothing but a few sickly plants are pro∣duced.
<PB N="478" REF="513"/>
In this miserable country, wells are so
rare, that travellers enumerate only five between
Cairo and Mount Sinai, and the water they con∣tain
is bitter and saltish.</P>
<P>When the superficial waters can find no out∣lets
or channels, they form marshes and fens.
The most celebrated fens in Europe are those of
Russia at the source of the Tanais; and those of
Savolaxia and Enasak in Finland: There are also
considerable marshes in Holland, Westphalia, and
other countries. In Asia are the marshes of the
Euphrates, of Tartary, and of the Palus Meotis.
However, marshes are less frequent in Asia and
Africa than in Europe. But the whole plains
of America may be regarded as one continued
marsh; which is a greater proof of the modern∣ness
of this country, and of the scarcity of its
inhabitants, than of their want of industry.</P>
<P>There are extensive fens in England, particu∣larly
in Lincolnshire, near the sea, which has
lost a great quantity of land on one side, and
gained as much on the other. In the antient
soil many trees are found buried under the new
earth which has been transported and deposited
by the water: The same phaenomenon is com∣mon
in the marshes of Scotland. Near Bruges
in Flanders, in digging to the depth of 40 or 50
feet, a vast number of trees were found, as close
to each other as they are in a forest. Their
trunks, branches, and leaves were so well pre∣served,
that their different species could be easily
<PB N="479" REF="514"/>
distinguished. About 500 years ago, the earth
where these trees were found was covered with
the sea; and, before this time, we have neither
record nor tradition of its existence. It must,
however, have been dry-land when the trees
grew upon it. Thus the land that, in some re∣mote
period, was firm, and covered with wood,
has been overwhelmed with the waters of the
sea, which, in the course of time, have deposited
40 or 50 feet of earth upon the antient surface,
and then retired. A number of subterraneous
trees was likewise discovered at Youle in York∣shire,
near the river Humber. Some of them
are so large as to be of use in building; and it is
affirmed, that they are as durable as oak. The
country-people cut them into long thin slices,
and sell them in the neighbouring villages, where
the inhabitants employ them for lighting their
pipes. All these trees appear to be broken; and
the trunks are separated from the roots, as if
they had been thrown down by a hurricane or
an inundation. The wood appears to be fir; it
has the same smell when burnt, and makes the
same kind of charcoal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Phil. Trans. No. 228.</NOTE>. In the Isle of Man,
there is a marsh called <HI>Curragh,</HI> about six miles
long and three broad, where subterraneous fir∣trees
are found; and, though 18 or 20 feet be∣low
the surface, they stand firm on their roots<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Ray's Discourses, p. 232.</NOTE>.
These trees are common in the marshes and bogs
<PB N="480" REF="515"/>
of Somerset, Chester, Lancashire, and Stafford.
In some places there are subterraneous trees
which have been cut, sawed, and squared by the
hands of men; and even axes, and other imple∣ments,
are often found near them. Between
Birmingham and Bromley, in the county of
Lincoln, there are hills of a fine light sand,
which is blown about by the winds, and trans∣ported
by the rains, leaving bare the roots of
large firs, in which the impressions of the ax are
still exceedingly apparent. These hills have un∣questionably
been formed, like downs, by suc∣cessive
accumulations of sand transported by the
motions of the sea. Subterraneous trees are al∣so
frequent in the marshes of Holland, Frizeland,
and near Groningen, which abound in turfs.</P>
<P>Subterraneous trees are of different species,
viz. firs, oaks, birch, beech, yew, hawthorn, wil∣low,
ash, &amp;c. In the fens of Lincoln, along
the river Ouse, and on Hatfield-chace in York∣shire,
these trees stand erect, as if they were
growing in a forest. The oaks are extremely
hard, and are used in building, where they are
said to last long, which I think improbable, as
all the specimens I have examined lose their so∣lidity,
after being dried and exposed to the air.
The ashes are tender, and soon fall into dust.
Some of these trees are evidently cut and sawed
with instruments; and the hatchets, which are
sometimes found along with them, resemble the
knives formerly used in sacrifices. Besides trees,
<PB N="481" REF="516"/>
we also meet with vast quantities of filberds, a∣corns,
and fir-cones, in many other fens in Eng∣land,
Scotland, and Ireland, as well as in the
marshes of France, Switzerland, Savoy, and
Italy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Phil. Trans. abridg. vol. 4. p. 218. &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>For four miles round the town of Modena,
whenever the earth is dug to the depth of 63
feet, the workmen pierce about five feet more
with a boring instrument, through which the
water rushes up with such impetuosity, that it
fills the wells to the top, almost instantaneously;
the water in these wells continues perpetually,
and is neither augmented nor diminished by
rains or drought. What is still more remark∣able
in this spot, whenever the workmen dig to
the depth of 14 feet, they find the rubbish and
ruins of an antient city, paved streets, houses,
and different pieces of Mosaic work. Below
this, the earth is solid, and appears not to have
been moved. Still lower, however, we find a
moist soil mixed with vegetables; and, at the
depth of 26 feet, entire trees, as filberds, with
nuts upon them, and great quantities of branches
and leaves. At 28 feet, there is a stratum of
soft chalk, 11 feet thick, mixed with sea-shells;
and, after this, we still meet with vegetables,
leaves and branches of trees, till we arrive at the
depth of 63 feet, where there is a stratum of
sand mixed with gravel and shells, similar to
those that appear on the coasts of Italy. These
<PB N="482" REF="517"/>
successive strata lie always in the same order,
wherever pits have been dug; and sometimes
the boring instrument falls in with the trunks of
large trees, which the workmen pierce with
great labour: They likewise meet with bones of
animals, pit-coal, flints, and pieces of iron. Ra∣mazzini,
who relates these facts, thinks, that the
gulf <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Venice formerly extended beyond Mo∣der
and that this land, in the progress of time,
has been gradually formed by the rivers, assisted,
perhaps, by inundations of the sea.</P>
<P>I will insist no longer upon the varieties in the
composition of new strata. It is sufficient to
have sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wn that they have been produced by
no other cause than the waters that run or are
stagnant upon the surface, and that they are nei∣ther
so hard nor so solid as the antient strata which
were formed under the waters of the ocean.</P>

<HEAD>PROOFS
OF THE
THEORY OF THE EARTH.</HEAD>
<HEAD>ARTICLE XIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the changes of Land into Sea, and of Sea into
Land.</HEAD>
<P>FROM what we have remarked in Article 1.
7. 8. and 9. it is apparent, that the ter∣restrial
globe has undergone some great and ge∣neral
changes; and it is equally certain, from
what has been delivered in the other articles,
that the surface of the earth has suffered parti∣cular
alterations. Though we are not sufficient∣ly
acquainted with the order or succession of
these particular changes, we know the principal
causes which produced them. We can even di∣stinguish
their different effects; and, if we were
able to collect all the facts which natural and ci∣vil
history afford concerning the revolutions
<PB N="484" REF="519"/>
which have happened on the surface of the earth,
our theory would unquestionably receive addi∣tional
supports, and would be rendered still more
satisfactory.</P>
<P>One of the principal causes of these revolu∣tions
is the motion of the sea, which has conti∣nued
invariably the same in all ages; for, as the
sun, the moon, the earth, the waters, the air, &amp;c.
have existed from the moment of creation, the
effects of the tides, of the motion of the sea from
east to west, of the currents, and of the winds,
must have been felt for an equal time: And,
even supposing the axis of the globe to have
formerly had a different inclination, and that
the continents, as well as the seas, were diffe∣rently
disposed, the motions of the ocean, and
the causes and effects of the winds, would have
remained unaltered. In whatever part of the
globe the immense quantities of water which fill
the ocean were collected, they would be subject
to the same motions.</P>
<P>It was no sooner suspected that our continent
might formerly have been the bottom of the
sea, than the fact became incontestible. The
spoils of the ocean found in every place, the ho∣rizontal
position of the strata, and the correspon∣ding
angles of the hills and mountains, appear∣ed
to be convincing proofs; for, when we ex∣amine
the plains, the vallies, and the hills, it is
apparent, that the surface of the earth has been
figured by the waters. When we descend into
<PB N="485" REF="520"/>
the bowels of the earth, it is equally evident,
that those stones which include sea-shells, have
been formed by sediments deposited by the wa∣ters,
since the sea-shells themselves are impreg∣nated
with the same matter that surrounds them.
And, in fine, if we consider the corresponding
angles of the hills and mountains, we cannot he∣sitate
in pronouncing, that they received their
configuration and direction from currents of the
ocean. It is true, that, since the earth was first
left uncovered, the original figure of its surface
has been gradually changing: The mountains
have diminished in height; the plains have been
elevated; the angles of the hills have become
more obtuse; those bodies which have been rol∣led
about by the rivers have received a roundish
figure; new beds of tufa, of soft stone, of gra∣vel,
&amp;c. have been formed. But every thing
has remained essentially the same. The antient
form is still recognisable; and I am persuaded,
that every man may be convinced, by his own
eyes, of the truth of all that has been advanced
on this subject; and that, whoever has attended
to the proofs I have given, must be fully satis∣fied,
that the earth was formerly under the
waters of the ocean, and that the surface which
we now behold, received its configuration from
the currents and movements of the sea.</P>
<P>We formerly remarked, that the principal
motion of the sea is from east to west. The
ocean, accordingly, seems to have gained from
<PB N="486" REF="521"/>
the eastern coasts of both the Old and the New
Continent, a space of no less than 500 leagues.
For the proofs, we must refer to Art. IX. and
shall only here add, that the direction of all
straits which join two seas, is from east to west.
The straits of Magellan, of Frobisher, of Hud∣son,
of Ceylon, of the sea of Corea, and of
Kamtschatka, lie all in this direction, and ap∣pear
to have been formed by the irruption of
the waters, which, being forcibly pushed from
east to west, have opened these passages, where
the waters still preserve a stronger current in this
direction than in any other; for, in all straits of
this kind, the tides are high and violent; but,
in those situated on the western coasts, as that of
Gibraltar, of the Sound, &amp;c. the motion of the
tides is almost imperceptible.</P>
<P>The inequalities at the bottom of the sea
change the direction of the motion of the wa∣ters.
These inequalities have originated from
sediments and matters transported by the tides,
or by other movements in the water: The tides
are the principal, and first, though not the only
cause which produced these inequalities. The
wind is another cause; though its action be∣gins
at the surface, it agitates the whole mass to
the greatest depths, as appears from particular
bodies which are detached from the bottom of
the sea, and thrown ashore only during violent
storms.</P>
<P><PB N="487" REF="522"/>
It has already been mentioned, that, between
the Tropics, and even some degrees beyond them,
an east wind blows perpetually. This wind,
which assists the general motion of the sea from
east to west, is as antient as the tides; because
it is occasioned by the rarefaction of the air
produced by the heat of the sun. There are
two combined causes, therefore, the operation
of which is greatest in the equatorial regions:
1<HI>st,</HI> The tides, which are greatest in the southern
latitudes; and, 2<HI>d,</HI> The east winds, which con∣stantly
reign in these climates. These two causes
have concurred, from the first formation of the
earth, in producing a motion in the waters from
east to west, and in agitating them more vio∣lently
in this region of the globe than in any
other. It is for this reason that we find between
the Tropics the greatest inequalities upon the
surface of the earth. That part of Africa which
lies between these circles, is nothing but a group
of different chains of mountains, extending, for
the most part, from east to west, as appears
from the direction of the great rivers which tra∣verse
this unknown region. The same obser∣vation
holds with regard to the countries both
of Asia and America, which lie between the
Tropics.</P>
<P>The general motion of the sea from east to
west, combined with the tides, currents, and
winds, produce a variety of effects, both on the
bottom of the ocean, and on the coasts. Vare∣nius
<PB N="488" REF="523"/>
thinks it extremely probable, that the gulfs
and straits have been formed by reiterated efforts
of the ocean against the land; that the gulfs of
Arabia, of Bengal, and of Cambaya, have been
produced by irruptions of the waters, as well as
the straits between Sicily and Italy, between
Ceylon and India, between Greece and Euboea,
&amp;c.; that the probability of such irruptions, and
of certain lands having been deserted by the
sea, is strengthened by the scarcity of islands in
the middle of great seas, and by their never ap∣pearing
there in groups; that, in the immense
space occupied by the Pacific Ocean, there are
only two or three small islands near the centre
of it; and that, in the vast Atlantic Ocean be∣tween
Africa and Brasil, we find only the small
islands of St Helena and Ascension: But all
islands lie near large continents, as those of the
Archipelago, which approach the continents both
of Europe and Asia; the Canaries are near Afri∣ca;
the Indian islands lie near the eastern part
of the continent of Asia; the Antilles lie off the
coast of America; and the Azores alone lie at a
considerable distance both from Africa and Ame∣rica.</P>
<P>The popular tradition among the inhabitants
of Ceylon, that their island had been separated
from the peninsula of India by an irruption of
the sea, is extremely probable. The great num∣ber
of rocks and shoals between the island of
Sumatra and the continent demonstrate their
<PB N="489" REF="524"/>
former union. The Malabarians affirm, that
the Maldiva islands made once a part of the con∣tinent
of India; and, in general, we may believe,
without hesitation, that all the eastern islands
have been separated from continents by irruptions
of the ocean<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Varen. Geog. p. 203, 217, and 220.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The island of Great Britain appears to have
been formerly a part of the continent; and that
England was once joined to France, the narrow∣ness
of the strait, and the sameness of the strata
of stone and of earth on the opposite sides, are
a sufficient indication. If we suppose, says Dr
Wallis, that France was connected to England
by an isthmus between Calais and Dover, two
tides would necessary strike with violence against
each side of it twice every twenty-four hours;
and the operation of the sea, both on the east
and west of this isthmus, would, in the course
of time, necessarily wear away such a nar∣row
neck of land as we have supposed. The
tides acting with violence not only against
this isthmus, but also against the coasts of France
and of England, must have carried away vast
quantities of earth, sand, and clay, from every
part on which the waves exerted their fury.
Their course, however, being interrupted by the
isthmus, they would not, as might be imagined,
deposite their sediments upon its shores, but
would transport and deposite them on the great
<PB N="490" REF="525"/>
plain which now forms the marsh of Romney,
and is four miles broad and eight long; for no
man, who has ever seen this plain, can possibly
doubt of its having been formerly covered with
the sea, as, without the intervention of the dikes
of Dimchurch, the spring-tides would still over∣flow
a great part of it.</P>
<P>The German sea would act in the same man∣ner
against this isthmus and against the coasts of
England and Flanders, and would carry its sedi∣ments
into Holland and Zeland, the soil of which
was formerly under the waters, though it is now
elevated 40 feet above them. On the English
coast, the German sea must have occupied that
large valley which commences at Sandwich,
runs by Canterbury, Chatham, Chilham, and
terminates at Ashford, a space of more than 20
miles. Here the land is much more elevated
than it was in antient times; for, at Chatham,
the bones of an hyppopotamos have been found
buried at the depth of 17 feet, and likewise
anchors of ships, and sea-shells.</P>
<P>Nothing is more apparent than that new lands
are formed by the earth, sand, clay, &amp;c. tran∣sported
and deposited by the sea: For, in the
island of Orkney, which is adjacent to the marshy
coast of Romney, there was a flat space of ground
in continual danger of being overflowed by the
river Rother; but this flat, in less than 60 years,
has been considerably elevated by the accession
<PB N="491" REF="526"/>
of fresh matter brought in by every tide. This
river has beside deepened its channel so greatly,
that its mouth, which, less than 50 years ago,
was fordable by men, is now capable of receiving
large vessels.</P>
<P>In the same manner has the bank of sand,
which runs obliquely from the coast of Norfolk
to that of Zeland, been formed. This bank is
the place where the German and French seas
encounter since the rupture of the isthmus; and
it is here where the waters deposite the earth and
sand which they carry off from the coasts. It
is even not improbable but that this bank of sand
may, in a succession of ages, give rise to a new
isthmus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See philosophical transact. abridg. vol. 4. p. 227.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is extremely probable, says Mr Ray, that
the island of Great Britain was formerly joined
to France: Whether it was disjoined by an earth∣quake,
by an irruption of the ocean, or by the
operation of men, we know not. But the for∣mer
junction of Britain to the continent is ap∣parent
from the identity of the rocks and differ∣ent
strata, at the same elevation, on the opposite
coasts; and from the similar extent of the rocks
on each side, being both about six miles. The
narrowness of this strait, which exceeds not 24
English miles, and its shallowness, when com∣pared
to the depth of the neighbouring sea, ren∣der
it probable that England has been separated
from France by some accident. To these proofs
<PB N="492" REF="527"/>
we might add, that wolves and bears formerly
existed in this island: It is not probable that these
animals could swim over, nor that such destruc∣tive
creatures would be transported by men; for,
in general, the noxious animals of the continent
are found in all those islands which are very near
it, but never in those that are remote. This fact
was remarked by the Spaniards when they ar∣rived
in America<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Ray's discourses, p. 208.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the reign of Henry I. of England, a part
of Flanders was overflowed by an irruption of
the sea. In 1446, more than 10,000 persons
were drowned by a similar irruption in the ter∣ritory
of Dordrecht, and more than 100,000
round Dullart in Friseland and in Zeland. In
these two provinces, above 300 villages were
overflowed. The tops of their towers and spires
are still visible above the surface of the water.</P>
<P>From the coasts of France, England, Holland,
and Germany, the sea has in many places re∣treated.
Hubert Thomas, in his description of
the country of Liege, assures us, that the walls
of the city of Tongres were formerly surround∣ed
by the sea, though it is now 35 leagues di∣stant
from it. This he proves by several satis∣factory
reasons: Among others, he informs us,
that, in his time, the iron rings to which ships
were fastened, still remained in the walls. The
fens of Lincoln, of the island of Ely, and the
Crau of Provence in France, may be regarded as
<PB N="493" REF="528"/>
lands abandoned by the sea, which has likewise,
since the year 1665, retired considerably from
the mouth of the Rhone. At the mouth of the
Arno in Italy, a large quantity of land has been
gained from the sea; and Ravenna, which was
formerly a harbour, is no longer a sea-port.
The whole of Holland appears to be new land:
The surface of the ground is nearly on a level
with the sea, although it has received daily ele∣vations
from the mud and earths transported by
the Rhine, the Maese, &amp;c.; for the soil of Holland
was formerly, in many places, computed to be
50 feet below the bottom of the sea.</P>
<P>It has been alledged, that, in the year 860, a
furious tempest drove such quantities of sand up∣on
the coast, that the mouth of the Rhine near
Catt was entirely blocked up; and that this river
overflowed the whole country, overturned trees
and houses, and at last emptied itself into the
channel of the Maese. In 1421, another inun∣dation
separated the city of Dordrecht from the
main land, overwhelmed 72 villages, and drown∣ed
100,000 souls, beside a vast number of cattle.
The dike of Issel was broke down in 1638, by
the ice-boards from the Rhine shutting up the
passage of the water, which occasioned in the
dike an opening of several fathoms, and a great
part of the province was laid under water before
the breach could be repaired. The province of
Zeland, in 1682, suffered a similar inundation,
which drowned more than 30 villages; and an
<PB N="494" REF="529"/>
amazing number of men and cattle perished, ha∣ving
been surprised by the waters in the night∣time.
The loss would have been still greater,
had not a south-east wind opposed the motion
of the waves; for there was such a swell in the
sea, that the water rose 18 feet above the highest
ground in the province<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See les Voyag. hist. de l'Europe, tom. 5. p. 70.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The harbour of Hithe, in the county of Kent,
is entirely blocked up, notwithstanding much
labour and expence bestowed, on different occa∣sions,
to clear it. For several miles round, we
find an astonishing quantity of shells and other
sea-bodies, which had been accumulated in an∣tient
times, and which are now covered with
soil, and afford excellent pasturage. The sea,
on the other hand, often encroaches upon the
land; as, for example, the lands of Goodwin,
which formerly belonged to a nobleman of that
name, are now converted into sands, and are
covered with the waters of the ocean. Thus the
sea gains upon some coasts, and loses upon others,
according to their different situations and cir∣cumstances<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See phil. trans. abridg. vol. 4. p. 234.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Upon Mount Stella in Portugal, there is a
lake, in which are found the wrecks of ships,
though this mountain is 12 leagues distant from
the sea<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See Gordon's Geog. Gram. p. 149.</NOTE>. Sabinius, in his commentary upon
Ovid's Metamorphoses, tells us, that, in the year
<PB N="495" REF="530"/>
1460, a ship, with its anchors, were found in
one of the Alpine mines.</P>
<P>These changes of sea into land, and of land
into sea, are not peculiar to Europe. The other
parts of the globe, if properly investigated, would
furnish more striking and numerous examples.</P>
<P>Calecut was formerly a celebrated city, and
the capital of a kingdom of that name. It is
now reduced to an inconsiderable town, ill-built,
and almost deserted. The sea, which, for a cen∣tury
past, has gained greatly upon this coast,
now covers most of the antient city. The ves∣sels
moor upon its ruins, and the port is chocked
up with a number of rocks, upon which many
vessels have been wrecked<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See lettres edifiantes, recueil 2. p. 13<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The province of Jucatan, a peninsula in the
Gulf of Mexico, was formerly a part of the sea.
This neck of land stretches about 100 leagues
in length, and is no where above 25 leagues
broad. The air is hot and moist. The earth
furnishes plenty of water, though, in so large a
country, there are neither rivers nor brooks; and,
when pits are dug, such multitudes of shells e∣very
where appear, as leave little room for doubt∣ing
that this whole tract was formerly a part of
the ocean.</P>
<P>It is a tradition among the inhabitants of Ma∣labar,
that the Maldiva islands originally adhered
to the continent of India, and that they were de∣tached
from it by the violence of the ocean.</P>
<P><PB N="496" REF="531"/>
The number of these islands is so great, and they
are separated by such narrow channels, that the
bow-sprits of vessels drive off, in passing, leaves
from the trees on each side; and, in some places,
a vigorous man, by laying hold of a branch,
may leap into another island<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See voyages des Hollandois aux Indes Orientales, p. 274.</NOTE> The cocoa∣trees
found at the bottom of the sea, is a farther
proof that the Maldiva's formerly belonged to
the continent.</P>
<P>The island of Ceylon, those of Rammanakoiel,
and many other islands, it is believed, were also
disjoined from the continent by the currents,
which, in many places of the Indian sea, are ex∣tremely
rapid<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. 4. p. 485.</NOTE> It is certain, however, that the
sea has encroached 30 or 40 leagues on the
north-east coast of Ceylon.</P>
<P>The sea appears to have lately abandoned ma∣ny
of the promontories and islands of America.
We have already remarked, that the territory of
Jucatan is full of shells; the same phaenomenon
takes place in the low grounds of Martinico and
the other islands of the Antilles. The inhabi∣tants
distinguish the earth below the surface by
the name of <HI>lime</HI>; because they make lime of
the shells, great banks of which lie immediately
under the vegetable soil<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See Nouv. Voyages aux isles de l'Amerique.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There are some lands which the sea alternate∣ly
covers and leaves bare, as in several islands of
<PB N="497" REF="532"/>
Norway, Scotland, the Maldiva's, the gulf of
Cambaya, &amp;c. The Baltic-sea has gradually
gained a great part of Pomerania; and it has
covered and destroyed the celebrated port of Vi∣neta.
In the same manner, the Norwegian sea
has advanced into the continent, and formed
several islands. The German sea has incroach∣ed
upon Holland, near Catt, to such a degree,
that the ruins of an antient Roman citadel,
which was formerly situated on the coast, lie
now at a considerable distance in the sea. The
marshy ground in the island of Ely, and the
Crau of Provence, are, on the contrary, lands
which the sea has deserted. The Downs have
been formed by accumulations of sand, earth, and
shells, successively driven upon the coasts by
winds blowing from the sea. For example, on
the west coasts of France, Spain, and Africa, a
violent west wind reigns, by which the waters
are pushed with violence against the shores; and
downs, accordingly, are frequent on these coasts.
The east winds, in the same manner, when they
continue long, drive the waters so forcibly from
the coasts of Syria and Phoenicia, that large
chains of rocks, which are covered during the
west winds, are left dry. Besides, downs are
not composed of stones and marble, like the
mountains which have been formed in the bot∣tom
of the ocean, because they have not remain∣ed
long enough under the waters. That the wa∣ters
of the sea possess a petrifying power, and that
<PB N="498" REF="533"/>
the stones formed in the earth are very different
from those formed at the bottom of the ocean,
is fully evinced in my discourse on minerals.</P>
<P>Since finishing my theory of the earth, which
was composed in the year 1744, I have perused
M. Barrere's, dissertation on the origin of figu∣red
stones. It gave me peculiar satisfaction to
find that the ideas of this accomplished naturalist,
concerning the formation of downs, and the
duration of the sea upon the surface of the
earth which we inhabit, exactly corresponded
with my own. Aiguis-mortes, which is now
more than a league and a half from the sea,
was a port in the time of St Louis. Psalmodi
was an island in the 815; and it is now more
than two leagues from the sea. The same change
has happened at Maguelone. The greatest part
of the vineyard of Agde was covered, about 40
years ago, with the waters of the sea. In Spain,
the sea, within these few years, has retired con∣siderably
from Blanes, from Badalona, from the
environs of the river Vobregat, from Cape Tor∣tosa
along the coast of Valencia, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The sea may form hills and mountains in
different manners: 1. By transporting earth,
slime, sand, and shells from one place to another:
2. By depositing sediments composed of small
particles detached from the bottom and from the
coasts: And, <HI>lastly,</HI> hills and downs may be
formed by sand and other particles driven against
the coasts by particular winds; these are gradu∣ally
deserted by the sea, and become parts of the
<PB N="499" REF="534"/>
dry land. The downs of Flanders and of Hol∣land
are of this kind; they consist of small cle∣vations
or hills, composed of sand and shells,
which have been blown from the sea upon the
coasts. M. Barrere gives another example, which
merits observation. 'The sea,' he remarks, 'by its
motion, detaches immense quantities of plants,
sand, shells and slime from its bottom, which
are continually pushed by the winds and the
waves towards the coasts. The perpetual re∣petition
of this operation must give rise to gra∣dual
accumulations of new strata, which ele∣vate
the earth, produce downs and hills, en∣large
the land, and consine the sea within nar∣rower
bounds.'</P>
<P>'It is apparent that new strata of different
materials must have been formed by the con∣stant
attrition of the waters, by the deposition
of sediments, and by other causes, the operation
of which has been co-eval with the existence
of the globe itself. Of this we have a remark∣able
proof in the different strata of fossil shells,
and other sea bodies found at Roussillon near
the village of Naffiac, which is 7 or 8 leagues
from the sea. These beds of shells, which in∣cline
at different angles from west to east, are
divided from each other by strata of earth and
sand, sometimes of a foot and a half, and some∣times
of two or three feet in thickness. In dry
weather they seem as if sprinkled over with
salt, and form a chain of hillocks from 25 to
<PB N="500" REF="535"/>
30 fathoms high. A long chain of hillocks of
such a height could not be formed at once,
but gradually, and by a long succession of time.
Effects somewhat similar might have been pro∣duced
by an universal deluge. But, in this
case, the different beds of fossil shells, instead
of preserving a regular form, would have been
blended together without any order.'</P>
<P>I entirely agree with the sentiments of M.
Barrere, excepting as to the formation of moun∣tains,
which cannot be solely ascribed to those
causes which increase the land, and diminish the
boundaries of the ocean. On the contrary, I
think I can produce several convincing argu∣ments
to prove, that most of those eminences,
which appear on the surface of the earth, have
actually received their original formation in the
sea itself: 1. Because they have corresponding
angles, which necessarily imply the cause we
have assigned, namely, the motion of the cur∣rents.
2. Because downs and hills, which
have originated from materials thrown upon the
coasts, are not, like common hills, composed of
marble and hard stones. Besides, the shells found
in the former, are only in the fossil state; where∣as
those in the latter are entirely petrified. Nei∣ther
is the position of the strata equally hori∣zontal
in downs, as in the hills composed of
marble and hard stone, but are more or less in∣clined,
as in the hills of Naffiac. On the contrary,
in the hills and mountains formed by sediments
<PB N="501" REF="536"/>
under the waters of the sea, the strata are always
parallel, and very often horizontal; and the
shells and other matter of them are completely
petrified. I despair not of being able to prove,
that the marbles and other calcareous bodies,
which are almost all composed of madrepores,
astroites, and shells, have acquired their density
and perfection at the bottom of the ocean. But
the tufas, soft stones, incrustations, stalactites,
&amp;c. which are likewise calcinable, and have been
formed since the earth was left dry, can never
acquire the degree of density and of petrifaction
peculiar to marble and other hard stones.</P>
<P>The remarks of M. Saulmon, concerning the
<HI>galets,</HI> which are found in many places, may be
seen in the history of the French Academy, <HI>an∣no</HI>
1707. These <HI>galets</HI> are round, flat, finely
polished pieces of flint, thrown out by the sea
upon the coasts. At Bayeux, and at Prutel,
which is a league from the sea, galets are found
in digging pits and wells. The mountains of
Bonneuil, of Broie, and of Quesnoy, which are
18 leagues distant from the sea, are covered with
galets. They are also found in the valley of
Clermont in Beauvois. M. Saulmon farther
informs us, that a hole, 16 feet in length, was
pierced horizontally into the high beach of Tres∣port,
which consists of a soft earth; and that,
in the space of 30 years, it was entirely oblite∣rated
by the sea. Supposing the sea to encroach
<PB N="502" REF="537"/>
uniformly upon this shore, it will gain half a
league in 12000 years.</P>
<P>The motions of the sea, therefore, must be
regarded as the principal cause of all those chan∣ges
which have already happened, and of those
which are daily produced upon the surface of
the earth. But there are other causes, which,
though less considerable, have some effect in
changing the superficial parts of this globe. The
rivers, the brooks, the melting of snows, the tor∣rents,
the frosts, &amp;c. have given rise to many
alterations. The rains have diminished the
height of the mountains; the rivers and brooks
have elevated the plains, and dammed up the sea
at their mouths; the torrents and the melting
of snows have scooped out deep ravines or fur∣rows
in the vallies and narrow passages between
the mountains; the frosts have split rocks, and
detached them from their original stations: In∣numerable
examples of revolutions produced by
all these causes might be given. Varenius tells
us, that the rivers transport into the sea vast
quantities of earth, and deposite them at greater
or lesser distances from the shore, in proportion
to the rapidity of their currents. These portions
of earth fall to the bottom, and first form small
banks, which, by constant accessions, become
shoals, and at last appear in the form of fertile
and habitable islands. It is in this manner that
the islands in the Nile, those in the river St
Lawrence, the island of Landa, situated near the
<PB N="503" REF="538"/>
mouth of the river Coanza, on the coast of A∣frica,
the Norwegian islands, &amp;c. have received
their existence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Varen. Geogr. p. 214.</NOTE>. To these may be added the
island of Trong-ming in China, which has been
gradually formed by matters brought down by
the river Nankin, and deposited near its mouth.
This island is more than 20 leagues in length,
and from 5 to 6 in breadth<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Lettres edifiant. rec. 11. p. 234.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Po, the Trento, and other rivers of Italy,
bring down such quantities of earth into the
<HI>lagunes</HI> of Venice, especially in the time of
inundations, that they must be gradually filled
up. Many parts of them are already dry during
the ebb tide; and there is in them no depth of
water, excepting in the canals, which are sup∣ported
at an immense expence.</P>
<P>Large sand-banks are thrown up at the
mouths of the Nile, of the Ganges, of the In∣dus,
of the Plata, and of many other rivers.
La Loubere, in his voyage to Siam, informs us,
that the banks of sand and of earth augment
daily, at the mouths of the great rivers of Asia,
to such a degree that the navigation of them
becomes every hour more difficult, and will soon
be impracticable. The same observation applies
to the great rivers of Europe, and especially to
the Wolga, which empties itself by more than
70 mouths into the Caspian, and to the Danube,
which runs into the Black Sea by seven mouths,
&amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="504" REF="539"/>
As it seldom rains in Egypt, the regular in∣undations
of the Nile proceed from the torrents
which fall into it from Aethiopia. It brings down
vast quantities of mud, which it deposites annu∣ally
not only upon the soil of Egypt, but
throws it to great distances into the sea, where it
is laying the foundations of a new country,
which must arise, in the course of time, out of
the bosom of the ocean; for, upon sounding at
the distance of 20 leagues from the coast, the
mud of the Nile is found at the bottom of the
sea; and every year it receives fresh accumula∣tions.
The Lower Egypt, now called the <HI>Delta,</HI>
was formerly a bay<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Diodor. Sic. lib. 3. Aristot. de Meteor. lib, 1. cap. 14. Herodot. § 4. 5. &amp;c.</NOTE> Homer tells us, that the
island of Pharos was a day and a night's voyage
from Egypt; and now it is almost contiguous
to the land. The soil of Egypt is not every
where of an equal depth; it grows thinner the
nearer we approach the sea. Near the banks
of the Nile, there are sometimes more than 30
feet of good soil; but, at the end of the inun∣dation,
there remain not, perhaps, above 7 inches.
All the cities of the Lower Egypt have been
built upon artificial eminences<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Shaw's travels.</NOTE> The town of
Damietta, which is now ten miles from the sea,
was a part of the ocean in the year 1243. The
town of Fooah, which, 300 years ago, was situ∣ated
at the mouth of the Canopic branch of the
Nile, is now 7 miles distant from it. Within

40 years past, the sea has retired half a league
from Rosetto, &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Shaw's travels.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Many changes have also taken place at the
mouths of the great rivers of America, and even in
those which have been but lately discovered. Char∣levoix
tells us, that, at the mouth of the Missi∣sippi,
below New Orleans, the land runs out in∣to
a point, which appears not to be very antient;
because, wherever the earth is dug, plenty of
water is found; and besides, the many little
islands which have recently appeared in all the
mouths of this river, leave no room to doubt
but that this point of land was formed in the
same manner. It is certain, says he, that, when
M. Salle sailed down the Missisippi to the sea,
the mouth of this river was considerably dif∣ferent
from what it now appears.</P>
<P>The nearer, he adds, we approach the sea,
this difference becomes the more conspicuous.
There is no water in most of the small channels
cut in the bar by the river. These channels
are greatly multiplied by the trees brought down
by the current. A single tree, with its branches
and roots, when stopped in a shallow part of the
river, will entangle a thousand. I have seen,
says he, 200 leagues from New Orleans, collec∣tions
of trees, any one of which would sill all
the wood-yards in Paris. Nothing can disen∣tangle
them. The mud brought down by the
river serves as a cement to them, and gradually
<PB N="506" REF="541"/>
covers them. Every inundation leaves a new
stratum; and, in a few years, plants and shrubs
begin to grow. It is in this manner that most
points of land and islands, which so often change
the course of rivers, are originally produced.</P>
<P>All the revolutions, however, brought about
by rivers, are very slow, and become not consi∣derable
till after a long course of years. But
those which are occasioned by inundations or
earthquakes are sudden, and almost instantaneous.
According to the Timacus of Plato, we are as∣sured
by the antient priests of Egypt, 600 years
before the birth of Christ, that there existed an
island beyond the Pillars of Hercules, called
<HI>Atlantis,</HI> which was larger than both Asia and
Lybia taken together; and that this great island
was sunk under the waters of the ocean by a
terrible earthquake. 'Traditur Atheniensis civi∣tas
restitisse olim innumeris hostium copiis quae,
ex Atlantico mari profectae, propè cunctam
Europam Asiamque obsederunt; tunc enim
fretum illud navigabile, habens in ore et quasi
vestibulo ejus insulam quam Herculis Columnas
cognominant: Ferturque insula illa Lybiâ si∣mul
et Asiâ Major fuisse, per quam ad alias
proximas insulas patebat aditus, atque ex insu∣lis
ad omnem continentem è conspectu jacen∣tem
vero mari vicinam; sed intrà os ipsum
portus angusto sinu traditur, pelagus illud ve∣rum
mare, terra quoque illa verè erat conti∣nens,
&amp;c. Post haec ingenti terrae motu ju∣gique
<PB N="507" REF="542"/>
diei unius et noctis illuvione factum est,
ut terra dehiscens omnes illos bellicosos absor∣beret,
et Atlantis insula sub vasto gurgite mer∣geretur.'
<HI>Plato in Timaeo.</HI> This antient tra∣dition
is not devoid of probability. The lands
swallowed up by the waters were, perhaps, those
which united Ireland to the Azores, and the
Azores to the continent of America; for, in
Ireland, there are the same fossils, the same shells,
and the same sea-bodies, as appear in America,
and some of them are found in no other part of
Europe.</P>
<P>Two evidences are mentioned by Eusebius on
the subject of deluges: The one is Melo, who
affirms, that all the plains of Syria were former∣ly
laid under water: The other is Abidenus,
who says, that, in the reign of King Sisithrus,
there was a great deluge, which had been pre∣dicted
by Saturn. Plutarch <HI>De Solertia Anima∣lium,</HI>
Ovid, and other mythologists, describe the
deluge of Deucalion, which happened, they say,
in Thessaly, about 700 years after the universal
deluge. It is also alledged, that there was a
still more antient deluge in Attica, during the
time of Ogiges, about 230 years before that of
Deucalion. In the year 1095, a deluge in Syria
drowned a prodigious number of people<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Alsted, Chron. chap. 25.</NOTE>. In
1164, a deluge in Friesland covered the whole
environs of the coasts, and drowned several
thousands of the inhabitants<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Krank, lib. 5. c. 4.</NOTE>.
Another inun∣dation,
<PB N="508" REF="543"/>
in 1218, destroyed 100,000 men. Of
inundations there are many other examples, as
that which happened in England in the year
1604, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Impetuous winds may be regarded as a third
cause of changes on the surface of the globe.
They not only give rise to downs and hills along
the sea-coasts, but they often arrest rivers, make
them regorge, and change their directions. They
carry off cultivated lands, tear up trees, overturn
houses, and cover whole countries with sand.
Upon the coast of Britany, in France, we have
an example of those inundations of sand: The
history of the Academy, ann. 1722, describes it
in the following terms:</P>
<P>'In the environs of St Paul de Leon, in
Lower Britany, there is a province on the sea∣coast,
which, before the year 1666, was inha∣bited;
but is now totally deserted, on account
of the sand, which has covered it to the depth
of 20 feet, and which daily gains ground.
Reckoning from the above period, the sand
has advanced about 6 leagues into the country;
and it is now within half a league of St Paul,
and that town must probably soon be deserted,
The tops of steeples, and of some chimnies,
still appear above this ocean of sand. The
inhabitants, however, have always had leisure
to quit their possessions in safety; p. 7.'</P>
<P>'This calamity is augmented by an east, or a
north wind, which elevate this fine sand, and
<PB N="509" REF="544"/>
carry it in such quantities, and with such ra∣pidity,
that M. Deslandes, to whom the Aca∣demy
are indebted for the observation, when
walking in this country during an east wind,
found himself obliged to shake his hat and his
garments from time to time, on account of the
great weight of sand with which they were
loaded. Besides, when the wind is violent, it
carries the sand over a small arm of the sea as
far as Roscof, a port much frequented by fo∣reign
vessels; and the sand accumulates in the
streets of this villages to the height of two feet,
which obliges the inhabitants to drive it off in
waggons. It may be further remarked, that
the sand is mixed with ferruginous particles,
which are recognisable by the magnet.'</P>
<P>'The coast which furnishes this sand extends
from St Paul to Plouefcat, a space of more than
four leagues; and it is nearly on a level with
the sea when the tide is full. It is situated in
such a manner that only the east and north∣east
winds can blow the sand in upon the
country. It is easy to conceive how sand car∣ried
and accumulated into any place by the
wind, may again be taken up by the same
wind, and carried still farther. Thus the sand
may continue advancing, and covering new
lands, as long as the magazine from which it
originally proceeds shall remain unexhausted;
for, if the fountain were once dried up, the
sand, by advancing, would diminish in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,
<PB N="510" REF="545"/>
and its destructive consequences would gradu∣ally
decay. But it is not improbable that the
sea may long continue to supply fresh sand,
and keep this baneful magazine in a condition
to do perpetual mischief.'</P>
<P>'This disaster is not of an old date. Perhaps
it was not till lately that the place was suffi∣ciently
stored to allow great quantities of sand
to be carried off; or, perhaps, it has but re∣cently
been left uncovered by the waters.
This coast has undergone some change. At
present, the sea, at full tide, reaches half a
league on this side of certain rocks, which it
formerly never passed.'</P>
<P>'This miserable province justifies what has
been related, both by antient and by modern
travellers, that whole cities, and even vast
armies, have been buried by tempests of sand
in the desarts of Arabia.'</P>
<P>Mr Shaw relates, that the ports of Laodicea,
Tortosa, Rowadsa, Tripoly, Tyre, Acra, and
Jaffa, are blocked up with sand transported by
the high waves which rise on that part of the
coast, when the west winds blow with vio∣lence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Shaw's travels.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is needless to give more examples of alte∣rations
on the surface of this globe. The fire,
the air, and the waters, produce continual
changes, which, in a succession of ages, become
considerable. The sea and the land not only
<PB N="511" REF="546"/>
change places from the effects of general and
stated periodic laws, but a number of revolu∣tions
are brought about by particular and acci∣dental
causes, as earthquakes, inundations, sink∣ings
of mountains, &amp;c. Thus the surface of the
earth, which we regard as the most permanent
of all things, is subjected, like the rest of nature,
to perpetual vicissitudes.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the proofs delivered in Art. VII.
and VIII. it appears to be an established
fact, that the whole surface of what is now dry
land, was formerly buried under the waters of
the ocean. It is equally clear, from Art. XII.
that the flux and reflux, and other movements
of the ocean, perpetually detach from the coasts
and from the bottom of the sea, shells, and mat∣ter
of every species; and that these are deposited
in other places in the form of sediments, and
give rise to the horizontal strata which every
where appear. In the IX. art. we have proved,
that the inequalities on the surface of the globe
have been occasioned by the motion of the waters
of the sea; and that the mountains received their
original formation from successive accumulations
of the sediments above described. It is likewise
evident, from Art. XIII. that the currents which
first followed the direction of these inequalities,
afterwards bestowed on them their present fi∣gure,
that is, their alternate and corresponding
angles. From Art. VIII. and XVIII. it appears,
that most of the matters detached from the coasts
and from the bottom of the sea were, when de∣posited
in sediments, in the form of a fine im∣palpable
<PB N="513" REF="548"/>
powder, which entirely filled the cavi∣ties
of shells, whether this powder was of the
same nature, or only analogous to the matter of
which the shells were composed. It is unde∣niable,
from Art. XVII. that the horizontal stra∣ta,
which have been formed by successive accu∣mulations
of sediments, and which at first were
soft and ductile, acquired density and compact∣ness
in proportion as they dried; and that the
perpendicular fissures in the strata derived their
origin from the act of drying.</P>
<P>After perusing Art. X. XI. XIV. XV. XVI.
XVII. XVIII. and XIX. we must be convinced,
that the surface of the earth has been disfigured
by many revolutions and particular vicissitudes,
arising from the operation of the waters, and the
effects of rains, frost, rivers, winds, subterraneous
fires, earthquakes, inundations, &amp;c. and, conse∣quently,
that the sea has alternately changed
places with the dry land, especially in the first
ages after the creation, when terrestrial substan∣ces
were much softer than they are at present.
It must, however, be acknowledged, that our
judgment concerning the succession of natural
revolutions cannot fail to be very imperfect; that
we are still less competent judges of those changes
which owe their birth to fortuitous events; and,
that the defect of historic records deprives us of
the knowledge of particular facts. We desiderate
both time and experience. We never consider,
that, though our existence here be extremely li∣mited,
<PB N="514" REF="549"/>
nature proceeds in her course. We are
ambitious of condensing into our momentary
duration both the past and the future, without
reflecting that human life is only a point of time,
a single fact in the history of the operations of
the Almighty.</P>
