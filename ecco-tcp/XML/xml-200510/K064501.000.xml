<HEAD>REASONS
FOR
CONTENTMENT, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>HUMAN life has been said to resemble
the situation of spectators in a theatre,
where, whilst each person is engaged by the
scene which passes before him, no one thinks
about the place in which he is seated. It is
only when the business is interrupted, or
when the spectator's attention to it grows
idle and remiss, that he begins to consider at
all, who is before him or who is behind
him, whether others are better accommoda∣ted
than himself, or whether many be not
much worse. It is thus with the various
ranks and stations of society. So long as a
man is intent upon the duties and concerns of
his own condition, he never thinks of com∣paring
it with any other; he is never troub∣led
with reflections upon the different classes
and orders of mankind, the advantages or
disadvantages of each, the necessity or
non-necessity
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
of civil distinctions, much less
does he feel within himself a disposition to
covet or envy any of them. He is too much
taken up with the occupations of his calling,
its pursuits, cares, and business, to bestow
unprofitable meditations upon the circum∣stances
in which he sees others placed. And
by this means a man of a sound and active
mind has, in his very constitution, a remedy
against the disturbance of envy and discon∣tent.
These passions gain no admittance
into his breast, because there is no leisure
there or vacancy for the trains of thought
which generate them. He enjoys therefore
ease in this respect, and ease resulting from
the best cause, the power of keeping his
imagination at home; of consining it to
what belongs to himself, instead of sending
it forth to wander amongst speculations
which have neither limits nor use, amidst
views of unattainable grandeur, fancied hap∣piness,
of extolled, because unexperienced,
privileges and delights.</P>
<P>The wisest advice that can be given is,
never to allow our attention to dwell upon
comparisons between our own condition and
that of others, but to keep it fixed upon the
duties and concerns of the condition itself.
But since every man has not this power;
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
since the minds of some men will be busy
in contemplating the advantages which they
see others possess, and since persons in labo∣rious
stations of life are wont to view the
higher ranks of society, with sentiments
which not only tend to make themselves
unhappy, but which are very different from
the truth, it may be an useful office to
point out to them some of these considera∣tions,
which, if they <HI>will</HI> turn their thoughts
to the subject, they should endeavour to take
fairly into the account.</P>
<P>And first, we are most of us apt to mur∣mur,
when we see exorbitant fortunes pla∣ced
in the hands of single persons; larger,
we are sure, than they can want, or, as we
think, than they can use. This is so com∣mon
a reflection that I will not say it is not
natural. But whenever the complaint comes
into our minds, we ought to recollect, that
the thing happens in consequence of those
very rules and laws which secure to ourselves
our property, be it ever so small. The laws
which accidentally cast enormous estates in∣to
one great man's possession, are, after all,
the self same laws which protect and guard
the poor man. Fixed rules of property are
established, for one as well as another, with∣out
knowing, before hand, whom they may
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
affect. If these rules sometimes throw an
excessive or disproportionate share to one
man's lot, who can help it? It is much
better that it should be so, than that the
rules themselves should be broken up: and
you can only have one side of the alternative
or the other. To abolish riches would not
be to abolish poverty; but, on the contrary,
to leave it without protection or resource.
It is not for the poor man to repine at the
effects of laws and rules by which he him∣self
is benefited every hour of his existence;
which secure to him his earnings, his habi∣tation,
his bread, his life; without which he,
no more than the rich man, could either
eat his meal in quietness, or go to bed in
safety. Of the two, it is rather more the
concern of the poor to stand up for the laws
than of the rich; for it is the law which
defends the weak against the strong, the
humble against the powerful, the little
against the great; and weak and strong,
humble and powerful, little and great there
would be, even were there no laws whatever.
Beside; what after all is the mischief? The
owner of a great estate does not eat or drink
more than the owner of a small one. His
fields do not produce worse crops, nor does
the produce maintain fewer mouths. If
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
estates were more equally divided, would
greater numbers be fed, or clothed, or em∣ployed?
Either therefore large fortunes are
not a public evil, or, if they be in any de∣gree
an evil, it is to be borne with for the
sake of those fixed and general rules con∣cerning
property, in the preservation and
steadiness of which all are interested.</P>
<P>Fortunes however of any kind, from the na∣ture
of the thing, can only fall to the lot of a
few. I say, "from the nature of the thing."
The very utmost that can be done by laws
and government, is to enable every man,
who hath health, to procure a healthy sub∣sistence
for himself and a family. Where
this is the case, things are at their perfec∣tion.
They have reached their limit. Were
the princes and nobility, the legislators and
counsellors of the land, all of them, the best
and wisest men that ever lived, their united
virtue and wisdom could do no more than
this. They, if any such there be, who
would teach you to expect more, give you
no instance where more has ever been at∣tained.</P>
<P>But Providence which foresaw, which ap∣pointed
indeed, the necessity to which hu∣man
affairs are subjected, and against which
it were impious to complain, hath contrived
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
that, whilst fortunes are only for a few, the
rest of mankind may be happy without
them. And this leads us to consider the
comparative advantages and comforts which
belong to the condition of those, who sub∣sist,
as the great mass of every people do and
must subsist, by personal labour, and the
solid reasons they have for contentment in
their stations. I do not now use the terms
poor and rich, because that man is to be ac∣counted
poor, of whatever rank he be, and
suffers the pains of poverty, whose expences
exceed his resources; and no man is, pro∣perly
speaking, poor but he. But I at pre∣sent
consider the advantages of those labori∣ous
conditions of life, which compose the
great portion of every human community.</P>
<P>And, first, it is an inestimable blessing of
such situations, that they supply a constant
train of employment both to body and
mind. A husbandman, or a manufacturer,
or a tradesman, never goes to bed at night
without having his business to rise up to in
the morning. He would understand the
value of this advantage, did he know that
the want of it composes one of the greatest
plagues of the human soul; a plague by
which the rich, especially those who inhe∣rit
riches, are exceedingly oppressed. Indeed
<PB N="9" REF="8" MS="y"/>
it is to get rid of it, that is to say, it is to
have something to do, that they are driven
upon those strange and unaccountable ways
of passing their time, in which we some∣times
see them, to our surprise, engaged. A poor man's condition supplies him with
that, which no man can do without, and
which a rich man, with all his opportunities
and all his contrivance, can hardly supply
himself, regular engagement, business to
look forward to, something to be done for
every day, some employment prepared for
every morning. A few of better judgement
can seek out for themselves constant and
useful occupation. There is not one of you
takes the pains in his calling, which some of
the most independent men in the nation
have taken, and are taking, to promote what
they deem to be a point of great concern to
the interests of humanity, by which neither
they nor theirs can ever gain a shilling, and in
which, should they succeed, those who are to
be benefited by their service, will never know
nor thank them for it. I only mention this
to show, in conjunction with what has been
observed above, that of those who are at liber∣ty
to act as they please, the wise prove, and the
foolish confess, by their conduct, that a life
of employment is the only life worth lead∣ing;
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
and that the chief difference between
their manner of passing their time and yours
is, that they can chuse the objects of their
activity, which you cannot. This privilege
may be an advantage to some, but for nine
out of ten it is fortunate, that occupation is
provided to their hands, that they have it
not to seek, that it is imposed upon them
by their necessities and occasions; for the
consequence of liberty in this respect would
be, that, lost in the perplexity of choosing,
they would sink into irrecoverable indolence,
inaction, and unconcern; into that vacancy
and tiresomeness of time and thought which
are inseparable from such a situation. A
man's thoughts must be going. Whilst he
is awake, the working of his mind is as
constant as the beating of his pulse. He
can no more stop the one than the other.
Hence if our thoughts have nothing to act
upon, they act upon ourselves. They ac∣quire
a corrosive quality. They become in
the last degree irksome and tormenting.
Wherefore that sort of equable engagement,
which takes up the thoughts sufficiently, yet
so as to leave them capable of turning to
any thing more important, as occasions offer
or require, is a most invaluable blessing. And
if the industrious, be not sensible of the bles∣sing
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
it is for no other reason than because
they have never experienced, or rather suf∣fered,
the want of it.</P>
<P>Again; some of the necessities which
poverty (if the condition of the labouring
part of mankind must be so called) imposes,
are not hardships but pleasures. Frugality
itself is a pleasure. It is an exercise of at∣tention
and contrivance, which, whenever it
is successful, produces satisfaction. The
very care and forecast that are necessary to
keep expences and earnings upon a level
form, when not embarrassed by too great
difficulties, are an agreeable engagement of
the thoughts. This is lost amidst abundance.
There is no pleasure in taking out of a large
unmeasured fund. They who do that, and
only that, are the mere conveyors of money
from one hand to another.</P>
<P>A yet more serious advantage which per∣sons
in inferior stations possess, is the case
with which they provide for their children.
All the provision which a poor man's child re∣quires
is contained in two words, "industry
and innocence." With these qualities, tho'
without a shilling to set him forwards, he
goes into the world prepared to become an
useful, virtuous, and happy man. Nor
will he fail to meet with a maintenance
adequate to the habits with which he has
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
been brought up, and to the expectations
which he has formed; a degree of success
sufficient for a person of any condition
whatever. These qualities of industry and
innocence, which, I repeat again, are all that
are absolutely necessary, every parent can
give to his children without expence, be∣cause
he can give them by his own authority
and example; and they are to be commu∣nicated,
I believe, and preserved in no
other way. I call this a serious advantage
of humble stations, because, in what we reck∣on
superior ranks of life, there is a real dif∣ficulty
in placing children in situations,
which may in any degree support them in
the class and in the habits in which they
have been brought up with their parents:
from which great and oftentimes distressing
perplexity the poor are free. With health
of body, innocency of mind, and habits of
industry, a poor man's child has nothing to
be afraid of; nor his father or mother any
thing to be afraid of for him.</P>
<P>The labour of the world is carried on by
<HI>service,</HI> that is, by one man working under
another man's direction. I take it for
granted, that this is the best way of con∣ducting
business, because all nations and
ages have adopted it. Consequently service
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
is the relation which, of all others, affects
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he greatest number of individuals, and in
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he most sensible manner. In whatever
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ountry therefore this relation is well and
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quitably regulated, in that country the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oor will be happy. Now how is the mat∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er
managed with us? Except apprentice-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hips,
the necessity of which, every one, at
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>east ever father and mother, will acknow∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edge,
as the best, if not the only practicable,
way of gaining instruction and skill, and
which have their foundation in <HI>nature,</HI> be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ause
they have their foundation in the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atural</HI>
ignorance and imbecillity of youth:
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xcept these, service in England is, as it
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ught to be, voluntary and by contract; a
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>air exchange of work for wage; an equal
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>argain, in which each party has his rights
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd his redress; wherein every servant
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>huses his master. Can this be mended? I
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill add, that a continuance of this connec∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on
is frequently the foundation of so much
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>utual kindness and attachment, that very
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew friendships are more cordial, or more
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ncere; that it leaves oftentimes nothing
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> servitude, except the name; nor any dis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nction
but what one party is as much
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eased with, and sometimes also, as proud
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, as the other.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="13"/>
What then (for this is the fair way of cal∣culating)
is there in higher stations to place
against these advantages? What does the
poor man see in the life or condition of the
rich that should render him dissatisfied with
his own?</P>
<P>Was there as much in sensual pleasures▪
I mean in the luxuries of eating and drink∣ing,
and other gratifications of that sort, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
some men's imaginations would represen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
there to be, but which no man's experience
finds in them, I contend, that, even in these
respects, the advantage is on the side of the
poor. The rich who addict themselves to
indulgence lose their relish. Their desire<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
are dead. Their sensibilities are worn and
tired. Hence they lead a languid, satiated
existence. Hardly any thing can amuse, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
rouse, or gratify them. Whereas the poo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
man, if something extraordinary fall in hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
way, comes to the repast with appetite; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
pleased and refreshed; derives from his usua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> course
of moderation and temperance
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> quickness of perception and delight, which
the unrestrained voluptuary knows nothing
of. Habits of all kinds are much the same▪
Whatever is habitual becomes smooth, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
indifferent, and nothing more. The luxu∣rious
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
receive no greater pleasures from their
dainties, than the peasant does from his
homely fare. But here is the difference.
The peasant, whenever he goes abroad, finds
a feast, whereas the epicure must be sump∣tuously
entertained to escape disgust. They
who spend every day in diversions, and they
who go every day about their usual busi∣ness,
pass their time much alike. Attending
to what they are about, wanting nothing,
regretting nothing, they are both, whilst
engaged, in a state of ease; but then what∣ever
suspends the pursuits of the man of
diversion distresses him, whereas to the la∣bourer
or the man of business every pause is
a recreation. And this is a vast advantage
which they possess who are trained and
inured to a life of occupation, above the man
who sets up for a life of pleasure. Variety is
soon exhausted. Novelty itself is no longer
new. A musements are become too familiar
to delight, and he is in a situation in which
he can never change but for the worse.</P>
<P>Another article, which the poor are apt to
envy in the rich, is their <HI>case.</HI> Now here
they mistake the matter totally. They call
inaction ease, whereas nothing is farther
from it. Rest is ease. That is true. But no
man can rest who has not worked. Rest is the
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
cessation of labour. It cannot therefore be
enjoyed, or even tasted, except by those who
have known fatigue. The rich see, and not
without envy, the refreshment and pleasure
which rest affords to the poor, and chuse to
wonder that they cannot find the same en∣joyment
in being free from the necessity of
working at all. They do not observe that
this enjoyment must be purchased by pre∣vious
labour, and that he who will not pay
the prices, cannot have the gratification.
Being without work is one thing; reposing
from work is another. The one is as tire∣some
and insipid, as the other is sweet and
soothing. The one in general is the fate of
the rich man, the other is the fortune of the
poor. I have heard it said that if the face
of happiness can any where be seen, it is in
the summer evening of a country village.
Where, after the labours of the day, each
man, at his door, with his children, amongst
his neighbours, feels his frame and his heart
at rest, every thing about him pleased and
pleasing, and a delight and complacency in
his sensations far beyond what either luxury
or diversion can afford. The rich want this;
and they want what they must never have.</P>
<P>As to some other things which the poor
are disposed to envy in the condition of the
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
rich, such as their state, their appearance,
the grandeur of their houses, dress, equi∣page,
and attendance, they only envy the
rich these things, because they do not know
the rich. They have not opportunities of
observing with what neglect and insensibi∣lity
the rich possess and regard these things
themselves. If they could see the great
man in his retirement, and in his actual
manner of life, they would find him, if
pleased at all, taking pleasure in some of
those simple enjoyments which they can
command as well as he. They would find
him amongst his children, in his husbandry,
in his garden, pursuing some rural diversion,
or occupied with some trifling exercise,
which are all gratifications, as much within
the power and reach of the poor man, as of
the rich; or rather more so.</P>
<P>To learn the art of contentment, is only
to learn what happiness actually consists in.
Sensual pleasures add little to its substance.
Ease, if by that be meant exemption from
labour, contributes nothing. One, however,
constant spring of satisfaction, and almost
infallible support of chearfulness and spirits,
is the exercise of domestic affections; the
presence of objects of tenderness and endear∣ment
in our families, our kindred, our
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
friends. Now have the poor any thing to
complain of here? Are they not surrounded
by their relatives as generally as others.
The poor man has his wife and children
about him; and what has the rich man
more? He has the same enjoyment of
their society, the same solicitude for their
welfare, the same pleasure in their good
qualities, improvement and success: their
connection with him is as strict and inti∣mate,
their attachment as strong, their gra∣titude
as warm. I have no propensity to
envy any one, least of all the rich and great;
but if I were disposed to this weakness, the
subject of my envy would be, a healthy
young man, in full possession of his strength
and faculties, going forth in a morning to
work for his wife and children, or bringing
them home his earnings at night.</P>
<P>But was difference of rank or fortune of
more importance to personal happiness than
it is, it would be ill purchased by any sud∣den
or violent change of condition. An
alteration of circumstances, which breaks up
a man's habits of life, deprives him of his
occupation, removes him from his ac∣quaintance,
may be called an elevation of
fortune, but hardly ever brings with it an
addition of enjoyment. They to whom ac∣cidents
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
of this sort have happened never
found them to answer their expectations.
After the first hurry of the change is over,
they are surprised to feel in themselves,
listlessness and dejection, a consciousness of
solitude, vacancy and restraint, in the place
of chearfulness, liberty, and ease. They try
to make up for what they have lost, some∣times
by a beastly sottishness, sometimes by
a foolish dissipation, sometimes by a stupid
sloth; all which effects are only so many
confessions, that changes of this sort were
not made for man. If any public dis∣turbance
should produce not an equality,
(for that is not the proper name to give it)
but a jumble of ranks and professions
amongst us, it is not only evident what the
rich would lose, but there is also this further
misfortune, that what the rich lost the poor
would not gain. I (God knows) could not
get my livelihood by labour, nor would the
labourer find any solace or enjoyment in my
studies. If we were to exchange conditions
to-morrow, all the effect would be, that we
both should be more miserable, and the
work of both be worse done. Without deba∣ting
therefore, what might be very difficult
to decide, which of our two conditions was
better to begin with, one point is certain,
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
that it is best for each to remain in his
own. The change, and the only change, to
be desired, is that gradual and progressive
improvement of our circumstances, which
is the natural fruit of successful industry;
when each year is something better than the
last; when we are enabled to add to our
little household one article after another of
new comfort or conveniency, as our profits
increase, or our burthen becomes less; and,
what is best of all, when we can afford, as
our strength declines, to relax our labours,
or divide our cares. This may be looked
forward to, and is practicable, by great
numbers, in a state of public order and
quiet, it is absolutely impossible in any
other.</P>
<P>If in comparing the different conditions
of social life we bring religion into the ac∣count,
the argument is still easier. Religion
smooths all inequalities, because it unfolds a
prospect which makes all earthly distinctions
nothing. And I do allow that there are
many cases of sickness, affliction, and dis∣tress,
which Christianity alone can comfort.
But in estimating the mere diversities of sta∣tion
and civil condition, I have not thought
it necessary to introduce religion into the
enquiry at all, because I contend, that the
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
man who murmurs and repines, when he
has nothing to murmur and repine about,
but the mere want of independent property,
is not only irreligious, but ill founded and
unreasonable in his complaint; and that he
would find, did he know the truth, and
consider his case fairly, that a life of labour,
such I mean as is led by the labouring part
of mankind in this country, has advantages
in it, which compensate all its inconvenien∣cies.
When compared with the life of the
rich, it is better in these important respects.
It supplies employment, it promotes activity.
It keeps the body in better health, the mind
more engaged, and, of course, more quiet.
It is more sensible of ease, more susceptible
of pleasure. It is attended with greater ala∣crity
of spirits, a more constant chearfulness
and serenity of temper. It affords easier
and more certain methods of sending chil∣dren
into the world in situations suited to
their habits and expectations. It is free
from many heavy anxieties which rich men
feel; it is fraught with many sources of de∣light
which they want.</P>
<P>If to these reasons for contentment the
reflecting husbandman or artificer adds
another very material one, that changes of
condition, which are attended with a breaking
<PB N="22" REF="21" MS="y"/>
up and sacrifice of our ancient course
and habit of living, never can be productive
of happiness, he will perceive, I trust, that
to covet the stations or fortunes of the rich,
or so however to covet them, as to wish to
seize them by force, or through the medium
of public uprore and confusion, is not only
wickedness, but folly; as mistaken in the
end, as in the means; <HI>that it is not only to
venture out to sea in storm, but to venture for
nothing.</HI></P>
