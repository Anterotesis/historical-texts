<HEAD>DEDICATION.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">TO THE PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PERMIT me to return you my un∣feigned thanks for your kind reception of this <HI>Tragedy</HI> on the stage, and to request the continuance of your favour to it in the closet. It would be the highest ingratitude in me to forget the only patron I ever had the good fortune to meet with, by whose powerful assistance I have been enabled to defeat the combined forces of envy, malice and detraction. I must at the same time fairly confess, my victory over the enemy was owing, I believe, as many other victories have been, more to the art and prowess of my <HI>Officers</HI> than to any extraordinary merit of my own. To the first in command, Miss YOUNGE, I have infinite obligations, which I shall always gratefully acknowledge, tho' I may never have it in my power to repay them; nor can the skill and conduct of my generals, REDDISH, SMITH and PALMER, be sufficiently admired. To your patronage and protection I most heartily and sincerely recommend them: If I have been the happy instrument of giving them a favourable op∣portunity of rising in <HI>your</HI> esteem, it will give me the greatest satisfaction. <HI>You</HI> can best distinguish their merit, and <HI>you</HI> alone are able to reward it.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, Sir, your much obliged, And devoted humble Servant, The Author.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Written by a FRIEND.</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Spoken by Mr. SMITH.</BYLINE>
<L>A Tragic Tale, from Norman William's Age,</L>
<L>Simple, and unadorn'd, attempts the Stage.</L>
<L>Our silly Bard, more simple than his Tale,</L>
<L>Thinks on your polish'd Manners to prevail;</L>
<L>What in those barb'rous Days were counted Crimes,</L>
<L>Are Slips of course in these enlighten'd Times:</L>
<L>Let not your Ancestors too rude appear,</L>
<L>Though firm in Friendship, and in Love sincere.</L>
<L>Love then like Glory did each Heart inflame,</L>
<L><HI>Beauty</HI> was <HI>Virtue,</HI> and to win it, <HI>Fame,</HI></L>
<L>Now Lovers lose their Mistresses with Grace,</L>
<L>As at New-Market they would lose a Race,</L>
<L>Where, if in Hopes they seem a little cross'd,</L>
<L>'Tis for the Money of the Match that's lost.</L>
<L>When Tilts and Tournaments call'd forth the Brave,</L>
<L>The Fame of spotless Innocence to save,</L>
<L>Each gallant Knight preferr'd his Love to Life,</L>
<L>For <HI>then</HI> the greatest Blessing was a Wife:</L>
<L>To prove their Chastity the dauntless Fair</L>
<L>Would walk through Flames, nor singe a single Hair;</L>
<L>Nay, some so chaste, so cold to all Desire,</L>
<L>Not only scap'd it, they put out the Fire!</L>
<L>But now no Heroes die for Love's sweet Passion,</L>
<L>And <HI>fiery Trials</HI> are quite out of Fashion.</L>
<L>Ye Sons of Frailty—you whom Rage devours,</L>
<L>For yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this Night the Muse exerts her Pow'rs;</L>
<L><PB REF="5"/>
With crimson Hands, pale Cheeks, and blood-shot Eyes,</L>
<L>She bids the Furies in their Terrors rise!</L>
<L>In Valour's Breast their Scorpion Stings they dart,</L>
<L>First fire the Brain, and then corrupt the Heart.</L>
<L>But what avails all Virtue! Passion's gust,</L>
<L>Like Whirlwinds, drive it from the Heart like Dust;</L>
<L>When Reason dawns, well may Repentance mourn</L>
<L>Love, Friendship, Duty, by the Roots up-torn.</L>
<L>To sooth this fatal Vice, the Flatterer tells</L>
<L>In stormy Minds how warmest Friendship dwells;</L>
<L>The Tree whose sheltering Arms spread kindly round,</L>
<L>If Light'ning-struck, lies blasted on the Ground;</L>
<L>In vain will Merits past Indulgence claim,</L>
<L>One Moment's Rashness blasts whole Years of Fame.</L>

<BYLINE>Spoken by Miss YOUNGE.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>HA! ha! poor Creature! how you trembling stand!</L>
<L>Come to the Bar, Sir, and hold up your Hand;</L>
<L>You won't—by Council then you'd have it done,</L>
<L>And I must plead your Cause—well, get you gone.</L>
<STAGE>[Coming forward to the Audience.</STAGE>
<L>Now for the great Tribunal of Old Drury;</L>
<L>Are you all sworn there—Gem'men of the Jury?</L>
<L>Good Men, and true, I hope—stay, let me see,</L>
<L>Amongst you all he challenges—but three.</L>
<L>Physicians, Lawyers, Parsons he admits,</L>
<L>Beaux, Ladies, Courtiers, Macaronies, Cits,</L>
<L>And only scratches—<HI>Critics, News-writers,</HI> and <HI>Wits.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The <HI>Critic</HI> first we banish from our Session,</L>
<L>Death is his Trade, and Damning—his Profession;</L>
<L>Disqualisy'd—because, to say no further,</L>
<L>Butchers are never heard in case of Murther.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next we disclaim th' <HI>Artificers</HI> of <HI>News,</HI></L>
<L>Who live by Fibs, and flourish by Abuse;</L>
<L>They must condemn, or lose their daily Bread;</L>
<L>If they don't cut, and slash—they're never read;</L>
<L>Like fabled Giants here they roam for Food,</L>
<L>And Fe! Fa! Fum! snuff up an Author's Blood;</L>
<L>In the next <HI>Ledger</HI> hang him up to roast,</L>
<L>Or tear him Piece-meal in—the <HI>Morning Post.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To <HI>Wits</HI> we last except, and 'bove all other,</L>
<L>The Hero of our Tale—a <HI>Rival Brother!</HI></L>
<L><PB REF="7"/>
As Rogues, just 'scap'd the Gallows, join the Shrieves,</L>
<L>Turn Hangmen, and tuck up their Fellow Thieves;</L>
<L>So Bards condemn'd, exert the Critic's Skill,</L>
<L>And execute their Brethren of the Quill!</L>
<L>If like their own, indeed, the Brat should die,</L>
<L>They'll gladly join to write—its Elegy;</L>
<L>But if the Child is strong, and like to live,</L>
<L>That is a Crime they never can forgive.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From such let English Juries still be free,</L>
<L>Our Author here appeals to your Decree,</L>
<L>The Public is—a Court of Equity.</L>
<L>If he has shock'd your Taste, your Sense, or Reason,</L>
<L>Or against Nature guilty been of Treason,</L>
<L>Off with his Head;—but if with honest Art</L>
<L>His well-meant Scenes have touch'd the feeling Heart;</L>
<L>If they have rais'd your Pity, wak'd your Fears,</L>
<L>Or sweetly have "beguil'd you of your Tears,"</L>
<L>Let venial Errors your Indulgence claim,</L>
<L>Your Voice his Triumph, your Applause his Fame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Speak by your Foreman—what says Goodman Pit?</L>
<L>Will you condemn the Prisoner, or acquit?</L>
<L>Your Verdict, Sirs, <HI>Not Guilty</HI>—if you please—</L>
<L>You smile—<HI>Acquitted</HI>—hope you'll pay his Fees.</L>

<STAGE>MATILDA, BERTHA.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>I Thank thee, gentle Bertha, for thy goodness;</L>
<L>If aught cou'd sooth the anguish of my soul,</L>
<L>Or raise it from the horrors of despair</L>
<L>To hope and joy, 'twou'd be thy gen'rous friendship:</L>
<L>But I am sunk so deep in misery,</L>
<L>That comfort cannot reach me.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BERTHA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Talk not thus,</L>
<L>My sweet Matilda; innocence, like thine,</L>
<L>Must be the care of all-directing heav'n.</L>
<L>Already hath the interposing hand</L>
<L>Of providence redeem'd thee from the rage</L>
<L>Of savage war, and shelter'd thee within</L>
<L>This calm asylum. Mercia's potent Earl,</L>
<L>The noble Morcar, will protect thy virtues;</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="9"/>
And, if I err not, wishes but to share</L>
<L>His conquests with thee.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>O my friend, oft times</L>
<L>The flow'ry path that tempts our wand'ring steps</L>
<L>But leads to mis'ry; what thou fondly deem'st</L>
<L>My soul's best comfort, is its bitt'rest woe.</L>
<L>Earl Morcar loves me. To the gen'rous mind</L>
<L>The heaviest debt is that of gratitude,</L>
<L>When 'tis not in our power to repay it.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BERTHA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Oft' have I heard thee say, to him thou ow'st</L>
<L>Thy honour and thy life.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>I told thee truth.</L>
<L>Beneath my father's hospitable roof,</L>
<L>I spent my earlier happier days in peace</L>
<L>And safety: When the Norman conqu'ror came,</L>
<L>Discord, thou know'st, soon lit her fatal torch,</L>
<L>And spread destruction o'er this wretched land.</L>
<L>The loyal Ranulph flew to William's aid,</L>
<L>And left me to a faithful peasant's care,</L>
<L>Who liv'd, sequester'd, in the fertile plains</L>
<L>Of rich Northumbria: There awhile I dwelt</L>
<L>In sweet retirement, when the savage Malcolm</L>
<L>Rush'd on our borders.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BERTHA.</SPEAKER>
<L>I remember well</L>
<L>The melancholy hour. Confusion rag'd</L>
<L>On ev'ry side, and desolation spread</L>
<L>Its terrors round us. How did'st thou escape?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>A crew of desp'rate ruffians seiz'd upon me,</L>
<L>A helpless prey: For, O! he was not there,</L>
<L>Who best cou'd have defended his Matilda.</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="10"/>
Then had I fall'n a wretched sacrifice</L>
<L>To rbutal rage, and lawless violence,</L>
<L>Had not the gen'rous Morcar interpos'd</L>
<L>To save me: Tho' he join'd the guilty cause</L>
<L>Of foul rebellion, yet his soul abhor'd</L>
<L>Such violation. At his awful voice</L>
<L>The surly ruffians left me, and retir'd.</L>
<L>He bore me, half expiring in his arms,</L>
<L>Back to his tent; with ev'ry kind attention</L>
<L>There strove to sooth my griefs, and promis'd, soon</L>
<L>As fit occasion offer'd, to restore me</L>
<L>To my afflicted father.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BERTHA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Something sure</L>
<L>Was due to gen'rous Morcar for his aid,</L>
<L>So timely given.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>No doubt: But mark what follow'd.</L>
<L>In my deliverer too soon I found</L>
<L>An ardent lover, sighing at my feet.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BERTHA.</SPEAKER>
<L>And what is there the proudest of our sex</L>
<L>Cou'd wish for more? To be the envy'd bride</L>
<L>Of noble Morcar, first of England's peers,</L>
<L>In fame and fortune.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Never trust, my Bertha,</L>
<L>To outward shew. 'Tis not the smiles of fortune,</L>
<L>The pomp of wealth, or splendor of a court,</L>
<L>Can make us happy. In the mind alone,</L>
<L>Rests solid joy, and true felicity,</L>
<L>Which I can never taste: For, O, my friend!</L>
<L>A secret sorrow weighs upon my heart.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER>BERTHA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Then pour it in the bosom of thy friend;</L>
<L>Let me partake it with thee.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Gen'rous maid!</L>
<L>Know then, for nought will I conceal from thee,</L>
<L>I honour Mercia's Earl, revere his virtues,</L>
<L>And wish I cou'd repay him with myself;</L>
<L>But, blushing, I acknowledge it, the heart</L>
<L>His vows solicit, is not mine to give.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BERTHA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Has then Tome happier youth—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Another time</L>
<L>I'll tell thee all the story of our loves.</L>
<L>But, O, my Bertha! did'st thou know to whom</L>
<L>My virgin faith is plighted, thou wou'd'st say</L>
<L>I am indeed unhappy.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BERTHA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Cou'd Matilda</L>
<L>Bestow the treasure of her heart on one</L>
<L>Unworthy of her choice?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Unworthy! No.</L>
<L>I glory in my passion for the best,</L>
<L>The loveliest of his sex. O! he was all</L>
<L>That bounteous nature, prodigal of charms,</L>
<L>Did on her choicest fav'rite e'er bestow.</L>
<L>His graceful form and sweet deportment spoke</L>
<L>The fairer beauties of his kindred soul,</L>
<L>Where e'vry grace and ev'ry virtue shone.</L>
<L>But thou wilt tremble, Bertha, when I tell thee,</L>
<L>He is Earl Morcar's—brother.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER>BERTHA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Ha! his brother!</L>
<L>The noble Edwin! Often have I heard</L>
<L>My father—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Did Lord Edrick know him then?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BERTHA.</SPEAKER>
<L>He knew his virtues, and his fame in arms,</L>
<L>And often wou'd lament the dire effects</L>
<L>Of civil discord, that cou'd thus dissolve</L>
<L>The ties of nature, and of brethren make</L>
<L>The bitt'rest foes. If right I learn, Lord Edwin</L>
<L>Is William's firmest friend, and still supports</L>
<L>His royal master.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yes, my Bertha, there</L>
<L>I still find comfort: Edwin ne'er was stain'd</L>
<L>As Morcar is, with foul disloyalty,</L>
<L>But stands betwixt his sov'reign and the rage</L>
<L>Of rebel multitudes, to guard his throne.</L>
<L>If nobly fighting in his country's cause,</L>
<L>My hero falls, I shall not weep alone;</L>
<L>The king he lov'd and honour'd, will lament him,</L>
<L>And grateful England mix her tears with mine.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BERTHA.</SPEAKER>
<L>And doth Earl Morcar know of Edwin's love?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>O, no! I wou'd not for a thousand worlds</L>
<L>He shou'd suspect it, lest his fiery soul</L>
<L>Shou'd catch th' alarm, and kindle to a flame</L>
<L>That might destroy us all.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BERTHA.</SPEAKER>
<L>I know his warmth</L>
<L>And vehemence of temper, unrestrain'd</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="13"/>
By laws, and spurning at the royal pow'r</L>
<L>Which he contemns, he rules despotic here.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Alas! how man from man, and brother oft</L>
<L>From brother differs! Edwin's tender passion</L>
<L>Is soft and gentle as the balmy breath</L>
<L>Of vernal zephyrs; whilst the savage north,</L>
<L>That curls the angry ocean into storms,</L>
<L>Is a faint image of Earl Morcar's love:</L>
<L>'Tis rage, 'tis fury all. When last we met</L>
<L>He knit his angry brow, and frown'd severe</L>
<L>Upon me; then, with wild distracted look,</L>
<L>Bade me beware of trifling with his passion,</L>
<L>He wou'd not brook it—trembling I retir'd,</L>
<L>And bath'd my couch in tears.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BERTHA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Unhappy maid!</L>
<L>But time, that softens ev'ry human woe,</L>
<L>Will bring some blest event, and lighten thine.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Alas! thou know'st not what it is to love.</L>
<L>Haply thy tender heart hath never felt</L>
<L>The tortures of that soul-bewitching passion.</L>
<L>Its joys are sweet and poignant, but its pangs</L>
<L>Are exquisite, as I have known too well:</L>
<L>For, O! my Bertha, since the fatal hour</L>
<L>When Edwin left me, never hath sweet peace,</L>
<L>That us'd to dwell with all its comforts here,</L>
<L>'E'er deign'd to visit this afflicted breast.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BERTHA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Too plain, alas! I read thy sorrows; grief</L>
<L>Sits in sad triumph on thy faded cheek,</L>
<L>And half obscures the lustre of thy beauties.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="14" MS="y"/>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Talk not of beauty, 'tis our sex's bane,</L>
<L>And leads but to destruction. I abhor</L>
<L>The fatal gift. O! would it had pleas'd heav'n</L>
<L>To brand my homely features with the mark</L>
<L>Of foul deformity, or let me pass</L>
<L>Unknown, and undistinguish'd from the herd</L>
<L>Of vulgar forms, save by the partial eye</L>
<L>Of my lov'd Edwin; then had I been blest</L>
<L>With charms unenvy'd, and a guiltless love.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BERTHA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Where is thy Edwin now?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Alas! I know not.</L>
<L>'Tis now three years since last these eyes beheld</L>
<L>Their dearest object. In that humble vale,</L>
<L>Whence, as I told thee, Malcolm's fury drove me,</L>
<L>There first we met. O! how I cherish still</L>
<L>The fond remembrance! There we first exchang'd</L>
<L>Our mutual vows, the day of happiness</L>
<L>Was fixt; it came, and in a few short hours</L>
<L>He had been made indissolubly mine,</L>
<L>When fortune, envious of our happiness,</L>
<L>And William's danger, call'd him to the field.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BERTHA.</SPEAKER>
<L>And since that parting have ye never met?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>O never, Bertha, never but in thought.</L>
<L>Imagination, kind anticipator</L>
<L>Of love's pleasures, brings us oft' together.</L>
<L>Oft' as I sit within my lonely tent,</L>
<L>And cast my wishful eyes o'er yonder plain,</L>
<L>In ev'ry passing traveller I strive</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="15"/>
To trace his image, hear his lovely voice</L>
<L>In ev'ry sound, and fain wou'd flatter me</L>
<L>Edwin still lives, still loves his lost Matilda.</L>

<L>Who knows but fate, propitious to thy love,</L>
<L>May guide him hither.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Gracious heav'n forbid!</L>
<L>Consider, Bertha, if the chance of war</L>
<L>Shou'd this way lead him, he must come in arms</L>
<L>Against his brother: Oh! 'tis horrible</L>
<L>To think on. Shou'd they meet, and Edwin fall,</L>
<L>What shall support me? And if vict'ry smiles</L>
<L>Upon my love, how dear will be the purchase</L>
<L>By Morcar's blood! Then must I lose my friend,</L>
<L>My guardian, my protector—ev'ry way</L>
<L>Matilda must be wretched.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BERTHA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Is there ought</L>

<L>One hope remains, the gen'rous Siward—he</L>
<L>Might save me still. His sympathetic heart</L>
<L>Can feel for the afflicted.—I have heard,</L>

<L>When the impetuous Morcar scatters fear</L>
<L>And terror round him, he, and he alone</L>

<L>Canst thou ask the cause,</L>

<L>Urge no more, my Lord,</L>

<L>How much thy friend deserves, how much, alas,</L>
<L>I owe him!—If it be Earl Morcar's wish</L>

To make me happy, why am I detain'd</L>
<L>A pris'ner here: Spight of his solemn promise</L>

<SPEAKER>SIWARD.</SPEAKER>
<L>I own it; yet the cause pleads strongly for him.</L>
<L>If by thy own too pow'rful charms misled,</L>
<L>He deviates from the paths of rigid honour,</L>
<L>Matilda might forgive. Thou know'st he lives</L>
<L>But in thy smiles; his love-enchanted soul</L>

<L>There are, my Lord, who most offend, where most</L>

<L>I know his weakness, know his follies all,</L>
<L>And feel 'em but too well: He loves with transport,</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="18"/>

<L>Or strong resentment, his impetuous soul</L>
<L>Is hurried on, 'till reason quits her seat,</L>
<L>And passion takes the loosely-flowing rein;</L>
<L>Then all is rage, confusion, and despair.</L>
<L>And yet, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> remov'd</L>
<L>The veil of error, he will weep his faults</L>

<L>For all his venial rashness, that deserve</L>
<L>A sov'reign's love, and claim a nation's praise;</L>
<L>Virtues that merit happiness and thee.</L>
<L>Why wilt thou thus despise my noble friend?</L>
<L>His birth and fortune, with the rank he bears</L>

<L>Thrice welcome to my arms, my noble Siward;</L>
<L>At length we meet in joy, the day is ours;</L>
<L>Thanks to thy friendly aid.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIWARD.</SPEAKER>
<L>We must not boast;</L>
<L>'Twas hardly purchas'd, and has cost us dear:</L>
<L>You follow'd 'em too close.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>I own 'twas rash;</L>
<L>My youthful ardor urg'd the keen pusuit</L>
<L>Too far; and but for thee I had been lost.</L>
<L>In war, thy arm protects me, and in peace,</L>
<L>Thy councils guide. O! how shall I return</L>
<L>Thy goodness? Thou wer't born to save thy friend.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIWARD.</SPEAKER>
<L>Away. I'll not be thank'd. I've done my duty,</L>
<L>And if thou think'st thyself indebted for it,</L>
<L>Repay me not with flatt'ry, but with love.</L>
<L>E'er since my soul with thine, congonial met</L>
<L><PB N="25" REF="32"/>
In social bands, and mark'd thee for her own,</L>
<L>Thy int'rest and thy happiness have been</L>

<L>Ha!</L>
<L>Matilda's father! then I'm satisfy'd.</L>
<L>The wily chief! by heav'n he shall repay me</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIWARD.</SPEAKER>
<L>Still thy rapid passions</L>
<L>O'erpow'r thy reason. What if it shou'd serve</L>
<L><PB N="26" REF="33"/>
A better purpose; smooth thy paths to bliss,</L>
<L>And gain Matilda for thee!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>O, my friend!</L>
<L>My Siward, do not flatter me: By heav'n,</L>
<L>Her kind consent wou'd give my ravish'd soul</L>
<L>More true and heart-felt happiness than cou'd</L>
<L>A thousand vict'ries o'er the proud usurper.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIWARD.</SPEAKER>
<L>Know then, I gave him liberty and life</L>
<L>On these conditions—That he shou'd with-draw</L>
<L>His pow'rs from William's aid, and never more</L>
<L>Assist his cause; the time wou'd come, I told him,</L>
<L>That he shou'd know to whom he ow'd the boon,</L>
<L>And how he might repay it.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>That was kind,</L>
<L>Indeed, my Siward, that was like a friend.</L>
<L>O! thou reviv'st my drooping heart; but tell me</L>
<L>Did my Matilda, let me call her mine,</L>
<L>Did she acknowledge, did she thank thee for it?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIWARD.</SPEAKER>
<L>O! I assum'd no merit; but to thee,</L>
<L>And to thy gen'rous, unexampled love</L>
<L>Did I attribute all. She sigh'd, and wept,</L>
<L>Pour'd forth a thousand blessings on thy head—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>And do'st thou think, my Siward, that one ray</L>
<L>Of hope remains?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIWARD.</SPEAKER>
<L>The clouds already vanish,</L>
<L>The prospect brightens round thee; haste and seize</L>
<L>The lucky moment. When the gen'rous mind</L>
<L>Is sooth'd by obligation, soon it opens</L>
<L><PB N="27" REF="34"/>
To the mild dictates of humanity,</L>
<L>And softens into sympathy and love.</L>

<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>O, Siward! cou'd'st thou teach me but to win</L>
<L>That lovely maid—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIWARD.</SPEAKER>
<L>The task is half perform'd</L>
<L>Already, and my friend shall soon be bless'd.</L>
<L>One thing, and one alone, remains to fix</L>
<L>Her doubtful heart, if yet a doubt remains.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>O! name it, Siward; if 'tis in the pow'r</L>
<L>Of wealth to purchase, or of victory</L>
<L>In the fair field of glory to acquire,</L>
<L>It shall not long be wanting.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIWARD.</SPEAKER>
<L>It requires</L>
<L>No price, but such as Morcar well can pay;</L>
<L>No vict'ry, but the vict'ry o'er thyself,</L>
<L>And thy own passions—Give up thy resentment,</L>
<L>Make peace with William, and Matilda's thine.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>Matilda mine! and must I purchase her</L>
<L>At the dear price of honour? with the loss</L>
<L>Of all my soul holds dear, my country's welfare?</L>
<L>My word—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIWARD.</SPEAKER>
<L>Away! whilst prudence warranted</L>
<L>Our honest zeal, I was the first to aid</L>
<L>Thy just revenge; but valour ill-advis'd,</L>
<L>And ill-exerted in a hopeless cause,</L>
<L>Degen'rate into rashness. You mistake</L>

<L>I'd have thee just and happy—We have been</L>
<L>Successful, let us now be generous,</L>

<L>To love, and to Matilda;</L>
<L>It shall be so—the struggle's past—away,</L>

<L>Her laws, her king, her master shall be mine;</L>
<L>I have no will but her's, and in her eyes</L>

Where is the gallant chief whom we subdu'd,</L>

<L>In yonder tent, a wretched pris'ner still,</L>

<L>Oppress'd his noble mind—We must release him.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thou know'st, my Siward, thrice we had o'erpow'r'd</L>
<L>His troops, and thrice his single valour turn'd</L>
<L>The fortune of the day: Since first I trod</L>
<L>The paths of glory, ne'er did I behold</L>
<L>Such deeds of valour wrought by mortal hand;</L>
<L>I almost envy'd, tho' I conquer'd him.</L>
<L>He wore his beaver up, nor cou'd I trace</L>
<L>His features, but he bears a noble form:</L>
<L>Know'st thou his quality or name?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIWARD.</SPEAKER>
<L>Not yet;</L>
<L>He seems industrious to conceal them both</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>Some deity protects him,</L>
<L>As its peculiar care, for as I rais'd</L>
<L>My sword against him, whether the soft passion</L>
<L>That triumphs o'er me, had unmann'd my soul,</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIWARD.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis most true, I saw</L>
<L>And wonder'd at it. When you lest the field,</L>

And seem'd to court his fate, till circling foes</L>
<L>Compell'd him to resign, and yield his sword.</L>
</SP>

<L>Away. I burn with ardor to forgive,</L>
<L>To free, and to embrace him: fly, my Siward.</L>

<STAGE>[SCENE, An Apartment belonging to SIWARD, opening to a wood.</STAGE>
<STAGE>EDWIN, MATILDA.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDWIN.</SPEAKER>
<L>THANKS to the noble Siward's gen'rous pity</L>
<L>For the distress'd; once more we meet, Matilda,</L>
<L>But only meet, alas! to mourn our fate,</L>
<L>To feel each others woes, and to be wretched.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Eternal blessings wait on him who thus</L>
<L>Cou'd sweeten sorrow's bitter draught, and make</L>
<L>Captivity a blessing! O, my Edwin!</L>
<L>A few short moments spent with those we love,</L>
<L>Is worth an age of common life.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDWIN.</SPEAKER>
<L>With thee</L>
<L>Indeed it is; but we are on the verge</L>
<L>Of a dark precipice, and ev'ry step</L>
<L>Is dangerous. If Morcar shou'd return,</L>
<L>And find us here together, we are lost</L>
<L>For ever; thou hast seen, and seen with horror,</L>
<L>The desp'rate rage of his tumultuous soul,</L>
<L>Let us avoid it, let us—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>What, my love?</L>
<L>Thou art my guide, protector, guardian, all</L>
<L><PB N="53" REF="62"/>
I have to boast on earth. O! teach me where</L>
<L>To find some blest asylum for my woes,</L>
<L>And guide my footsteps to the paths of peace.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDWIN.</SPEAKER>
<L>Let me entreat thee then—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>O, speak! thou know'st</L>
<L>I have no will but thine.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDWIN.</SPEAKER>
<L>Then leave me, leave</L>
<L>This hated roof: I have a friend within,</L>
<L>Who shall conduct thee to the royal camp</L>
<L>In safety; bear this signet to the king,</L>
<L>He will protect thee, and what ever fate</L>
<L>Decrees for me, Matilda may be happy.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>O! never, never: Safety dwells with thee,</L>
<L>And thee alone. Without my faithful Edwin,</L>
<L>The peopled city, and the crouded court,</L>
<L>Wou'd be a desart to me. No, my love,</L>
<L>We will not part: The same benignant pow'r</L>
<L>That led thee hither, that, beyond my hopes</L>
<L>Brought my lost Edwin to these arms again,</L>
<L>Will still protect that virtue which it loves.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDWIN.</SPEAKER>
<L>Did'st thou not tell me, that this very morn</L>
<L>Thou had'st determin'd, as the only means</L>
<L>To shun my brother's love, on sudden flight?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>But then I shou'd have fled in search of thee.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDWIN.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thou winning softness! how shall I reward</L>
<L>Such unexampled tenderness and truth!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="54" REF="63"/>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>By flying with me. Come, my love, lead on,</L>
<L>I'll follow thee to dangers and to death;</L>
<L>Nor perils shall affright, nor labours tire,</L>
<L>When thou art with me.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDWIN.</SPEAKER>
<L>No: It must not be.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why? What shou'd keep thee here?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDWIN.</SPEAKER>
<L>The ties of honour.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>And are they stronger than the bonds of love?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDWIN.</SPEAKER>
<L>To Siward's kind indulgence, well thou know'st,</L>
<L>I owe this little interval of peace,</L>
<L>This transient gleam of happiness with thee;</L>
<L>And shou'd I break my sacred word, his life</L>
<L>Might answer for it; wou'd'st thou have me thus</L>
<L>Repay his kindness? No, my love; I may</L>
<L>Be wretched, but I cannot be ungrateful.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Must thou return then to that hateful prison</L>
<L>When Morcar comes?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDWIN.</SPEAKER>
<L>I must. O! think when I</L>
<L>Am pent within a loathsome dungeon, who</L>
<L>Shall shelter then thy unprotected virtue?</L>
<L>No Edwin there to succour thee: Who knows</L>
<L>What brutal lust and pow'r may dare to act,</L>
<L>On a deserted, beauteous, friendless woman?</L>
<L>Distracting thought! A monarch's vengeance then</L>
<L>Wou'd come too late; wou'd make me poor amends</L>
<L>For my Matilda's violated charms.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="55" REF="64"/>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>He cannot be so mean, so base of soul,</L>
<L>Or if he shou'd, I have a dagger here</L>
<L>To save me from dishonour.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDWIN.</SPEAKER>
<L>What! by death?</L>
<L>Dreadful alternative! O! hazard not</L>
<L>Thy precious life, but seize the lucky moment</L>
<L>Which fortune gives us, e'er it be too late.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Urge me no more; already I have felt,</L>
<L>Too deeply felt, the pangs of absence from thee;</L>
<L>Another separation wou'd be worse</L>
<L>Than death, and all its terrors. No, my love;</L>
<L>We are embark'd on a tumultuous sea,</L>
<L>And must abide the fury of the storm.</L>
<L>The waves of angry fortune <HI>may</HI> o'erwhelm</L>
<L>But <HI>shall not</HI> part us: We will stem the torrent,</L>
<L>Brave the proud ocean's rage, and gain the harbour</L>
<L>Of peace and happiness—or <HI>sink</HI> together.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDWIN.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thou hast foretold the tempest, and behold</L>
<L>It rushes on us.</L>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter MORCAR and HAROLD.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Ha! Earl Morcar here!</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>Harold, I thank thee; thy intelligence</L>
<L>Was but too true.</L>
<STAGE>(turning to Edwin.</STAGE>
<L>Traitor! who set thee free?</L>
<L>They wou'd have 'scap'd my vengeance—false Matilda!</L>
<L>'Tis thus I am rewarded for my love,</L>

My ill-tim'd mercy to a thankless brother.</L>
<L>Back to thy dungeon, slave. Guards, drag him hence,</L>
<L>To prison, and to death.</L>
<STAGE>(to the soldiers.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDWIN.</SPEAKER>
<L>Or death, or life,</L>
<L>Are equal to me, if I must be torn</L>
<L>From my Matilda. But, whate'er thy purpose,</L>
<L>Be speedy in thy vengeance, nor delay</L>
<L>The cruel work; for know, thy master comes,</L>
<L>William approaches—to revenge my cause.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>But not to save thee.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDWIN.</SPEAKER>
<L>Then farewel, Matilda,</L>
<L>Perhaps for ever—If we meet no more</L>
<L>Thou wilt remember—But I will not doubt</L>
<L>Thy honour, or thy love. I know thy truth.</L>
<L>Know thou wilt act as best becomes thy fate,</L>
<L>Whate'er it be, and worthy of thyself.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Of <HI>thee,</HI> my Edwin, rather say of <HI>thee.</HI></L>
<L>Yes; I will copy well thy bright example;</L>
<L>I'll not disgrace thy love with woman's weakness,</L>
<L>But part without a tear. I will but stay</L>
<L>To tell thy tyrant brother how I hate,</L>
<L>How I despise him, and then follow thee.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>I'll hear no more—begone!—away with him.</L>
<STAGE>[Exeunt guards with Edwin.</STAGE>
<L>For thee, Matilda—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>What for me remains</L>
<L>I know too well; thy odious love, reproach</L>
<L>Unmerited, and threats which I despise.</L>
<L><PB N="57" REF="66"/>
Thou think'st I have deceiv'd thee—think so still.</L>
<L>Enjoy thy error. Thou believ'st us guilty;</L>
<L>'Twill make thee happy now—Perchance to find</L>
<L>Us innocent, may be thy punishment hereafter.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>Aye, 'twas a proof of innocence to fly,</L>
<L>Thou and thy paramour together.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>No;</L>
<L>I scorn a thought so mean. Cou'd I have left</L>
<L>My Edwin, long e'er this I might have been</L>
<L>Beyond the reach of tyranny; beyond</L>
<L>Thy hated pow'r; and safe beneath the wing</L>
<L>Of sacred majesty, in William's care.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>In William's care!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thy conqueror's—for know</L>
<L>The hero comes—to scatter blessings round him,</L>
<L>To heal his country's wounds, chastise rebellion,</L>
<L>And punish false perfidious slaves like thee.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>By heav'ns! she braves my wrath, insults my weakness,</L>
<L>And triumphs o'er her slave.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>There was a time,</L>
<L>When with an eye of pity, I beheld</L>
<L>Thy hopeless love; when I conceal'd my passion</L>
<L>For the dear idol of my heart, because</L>
<L>I fear'd 'twou'd make thee wretched; but thy rage,</L>
<L>Thy cruel treatment of a guiltless brother,</L>
<L>Has cancell'd all.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="58" REF="67"/>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>Then, mark me: If thou hop'st</L>
<L>For Edwin's freedom, shake off this vile passion;</L>
<L>Yield thy proud heart to him who best deserves it,</L>
<L>And meet me at the altar—Two hours hence</L>
<L>I shall expect thee there—Beyond that time</L>
<L>He may not live to thank thee for thy bounty.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Then let him perish—glut thy tyrant soul</L>
<L>With vengeance: bathe it in a brother's blood,</L>
<L>All ruffian, all barbarian, as thou art,</L>
<L>Thou can'st not murder his immortal fame:</L>
<L>Thou can'st not rob him of Matilda's love.</L>
<L>But know—when he, for whom alone this pulse</L>
<L>Wou'd wish to beat, this lazy blood to flow</L>
<L>Within my veins, when he shall be no more;</L>
<L>Another life shall satiate thy revenge;</L>
<L>Another victim shall attend thy triumph.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thou talk'st it nobly—'tis the common trick,</L>
<L>The affectation of thy sex to boast</L>
<L>A fancied firmness, which ye never knew;</L>
<L>But with affrighted nature thou wou'd'st shrink</L>
<L>When death approaches.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Put me to the proof.</L>
<L>If thou wou'd'st punish Edwin, know he lives</L>
<L>Within this breast—strike home, and pierce him there.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>Imperious woman! thou defy'st my pow'r,</L>
<L>And let it crush thee. If thy country bleeds</L>
<L>In ev'ry vein; if perjur'd Edwin falls,</L>
<L>As soon he shall, a victim to my rage;</L>

Thou art the murd'rer; thou the paricide:</L>
<L>I stand absolv'd; the guilt is all thy own.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>If it be guilt to suffer keen reproach,</L>
<L>Pain, persecution, terror, chains and death</L>
<L>For him I love, rather than stain my soul</L>
<L>With foul disloyalty, I am indeed</L>
<L>The guiltiest of my sex, and well deserve</L>
<L>The pangs I feel.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thou'st driv'n me to the pit</L>

<L>To share the dreadful ruin thou hast made.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>I know thy savage purpose; but remember,</L>
<L>The hour approaches when thou shalt repent</L>
<L>This base, unmanly triumph. William comes:</L>
<L>Hear that and tremble, thou unnat'ral brother;</L>
<L>Nor rocks, nor caves shall hide thee from his vengeance;</L>
<L>Inglorious, and unpitied, shalt thou fall,</L>
<L>And after ages shall consign thy name</L>

<L>Inexorable judge! I stand condemn'd,</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>O, they have pierc'd too deep; ev'n thou, my friend,</L>

<STAGE>MORCAR, HAROLD.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>TREASON and foul rebellion in my camp!</L>
<L>But I was born to be for ever wretched,</L>
<L>The sport of fortune. These base mutineers—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HAROLD.</SPEAKER>
<L>Your presence on the battlements, my lord,</L>
<L>Dispers'd 'em soon; they hang their heads in silence,</L>
<L>And all is peace.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(to himself.)</STAGE>
<L>It is not so within.</L>
<L>Wou'd it were done or—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HAROLD.</SPEAKER>
<L>What, my Lord?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>No matter.</L>
<L>What urg'd my soldiers to rebel?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HAROLD.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis thought</L>
<L>The gallant captive did by secret means</L>
<L>Excite them to revolt.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>It must be so.</L>
<L>By heav'n thou mak'st me happy with the tidings:</L>
<L>His head shall pay the forfeit.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HAROLD.</SPEAKER>
<L>Whilst he lives</L>
<L>We are not safe.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="67" REF="76"/>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>No more we are, good Harold;</L>
<L>'Tis fit he perish, is it not? What say'st thou?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HAROLD.</SPEAKER>
<L>Prudence demands his life to save your own.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>O! thou hast given such comfort to my soul—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HAROLD.</SPEAKER>
<L>My Lord—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>Be watchful: Bring me early notice</L>
<L>Of ev'ry motion: Go.</L>
<STAGE>[Exit Harold.</STAGE>
<L>Or I must fall,</L>
<L>Or Edwin—Hence ye visionary fears;</L>
<L>Ye vain chimeras hence—It is no matter:</L>
<L>Conscience I heed thee not; 'tis self-defence,</L>
<L>Nature's first law, and I must stand acquitted.</L>
<L>The prudent Siward seem'd to hesitate,</L>
<L>As if he wish'd, but knew not how to shun</L>
<L>The office. He who cou'd behold my tortures,</L>
<L>With all that cold tranquility, wou'd ne'er</L>
<L>Have ventur'd to remove them. But I've trusted</L>
<L>The sword of vengeance to a safer hand.</L>
<L>What ho! Who waits?</L>
<STAGE>Enter an OFFICER.</STAGE>
<L>That soldier whom thou saw'st</L>
<L>In private conf'rence with me, is he gone</L>
<L>As I directed him?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OFFICER.</SPEAKER>
<L>My Lord, even now</L>
<L>I saw him hast'ning tow'rd the tow'r,</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis well.</L>
<L>When he returns conduct him to me—Stay;</L>
<L><PB N="68" REF="77"/>
If Siward comes this way, I'm not at leisure:</L>
<L>I will not see him. <STAGE>(starts.)</STAGE> Hark! did'st thou not hear</L>
<L>The solemn curfeu?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OFFICER.</SPEAKER>
<L>No, my Lord.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>Not hear it!</L>
<L>It shocks my soul with horror—Hark! again!</L>
<L>Hollow and dreadful! Sure thy faculties</L>
<L>Are all benumb'd.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OFFICER.</SPEAKER>
<L>Indeed, I heard it not.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR</SPEAKER>
<L>Away, and leave me to myself.</L>
<STAGE>[Exit Officer.</STAGE>
<L>Methought</L>
<L>I heard a voice cry—stop—it is thy brother:</L>
<L>We lov'd each other well; our early years</L>
<L>Were spent in mutual happiness together:</L>
<L>Matilda was not there—I do remember</L>
<L>One day, in sportive mood, I rashly plung'd</L>
<L>Into the rapid flood, which had well nigh</L>
<L>O'erwhelm'd me; when the brave, the gallant Edwin,</L>
<L>Rush'd in and sav'd me—Shall I, in return,</L>
<L>Destroy my kind preserver? Horrid thought!</L>
<L>Forbid it heav'n! <STAGE>(pauses.)</STAGE> I am myself again.</L>
<L>All pow'rful nature! once more I am thine.</L>
<L>He shall not die—Who's there—</L>
<STAGE>Enter an OFFICER.</STAGE>
<L>My Oswald! fly,</L>
<L>Fly to the tow'r this moment, haste and save</L>
<L>My brother—Some base ruffian—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OFFICER.</SPEAKER>
<L>If, my Lord,</L>
<L>You mean the noble pris'ner there, I fear</L>
<L><PB N="69" REF="78"/>
It is too late: This moment as I pass'd</L>
<L>The citadel, I saw a mangled corse</L>
<L>Drawn forth by Siward's order—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>Slave, thou ly'st.</L>
<L>Away this moment, bring me better news</L>
<L>On peril of thy life.</L>
<STAGE>[Exit Officer.</STAGE>
<L>Who knows but heav'n,</L>
<L>In gracious pity, still may interpose</L>
<L>And save me from the guilt? It is not done;</L>
<L>It <HI>shall</HI> not—<HI>must</HI> not be—All's quiet yet;</L>
<L>I have not heard the signal.</L>
<STAGE>(The bell tolls.</STAGE>
<L>Hark! he's dead:</L>
<L>My brother's dead—O! cover me ye shades</L>
<L>Of everlasting night! Hide, if ye can,</L>
<L>A murth'rer from himself. Ha! see he comes:</L>
<L>His wounds are bleeding still; his angry eyes</L>
<L>Glare full upon me. Speak—what wou'd'st thou have?</L>
<L>Matilda shall be thine: He smiles and leaves me—</L>
<STAGE>(he pauses and recovers himself.</STAGE>
<L>'Twas but the error of my troubled soul.</L>
<L>O! guilt, guilt, guilt!</L>
<STAGE>(throws himself down.</STAGE>
<L>Here will I lay me down,</L>
<L>And end my days in bitterness and anguish.</L>
<STAGE>Enter SIWARD.</STAGE>
<L>Who's there? Ha! Siward here. <STAGE>(rises.)</STAGE></L>
<L>Speak, murth'rer, speak,</L>
<L>Where is my brother? Villain, thou hast snar'd</L>
<L>My soul; my honour's stain'd, my fame destroy'd,</L>
<L>And my sweet peace of mind is lost for ever.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIWARD.</SPEAKER>
<L>Matilda will restore it.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>Never, never.</L>
<L>The price of blood! No: Cou'd Matilda bring</L>
<L><PB N="70" REF="79"/>
The vanquish'd world, in dow'ry with her charms,</L>
<L>I wou'd not wed her. O! cou'd I recal</L>
<L>One hasty moment, one rash, cruel act—</L>
<L>But 'twas thy savage hand that—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIWARD.</SPEAKER>
<L>I receiv'd</L>
<L>Your orders: 'Twas my duty to obey them.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>Where slept thy friendship then? Thou know'st despair</L>
<L>And madness urg'd me to it—but for thee—</L>
<L><HI>Thy</HI> callous heart had never felt the pangs,</L>
<L>The agonies of disappointed love;</L>
<L>Thou did'st not know Matilda—Curs'd obedience!</L>
<L>How often has thy insolence oppos'd</L>
<L>Thy master and thy prince? how often dar'd</L>
<L>To thwart <HI>my</HI> will, and execute thy own:</L>
<L>But when I bade thee do a deed of horror,</L>
<L>And shed a brother's blood—thou cou'd'st obey me.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIWARD.</SPEAKER>
<L>Away! this is the trick of self-delusion,</L>
<L>The common cant of hypocrites, who rail</L>
<L>At others guilt, to mitigate their own?</L>
<L>I've been the mean, the servile instrument</L>
<L>Of thy base vengeance; but thou had'st prepar'd</L>
<L>Another, a low ruffian, to perform</L>
<L>The bloody office; I detest thee for it,</L>
<L>Despise, abhor thee.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thou wert once my friend.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIWARD.</SPEAKER>
<L>Henceforth I am thy foe—Thou hast destroy'd</L>
<L>The best of brothers, and the best of men.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>Despis'd by Siward—then my cup of sorrow</L>
<L><PB N="71" REF="80"/>
Is full, indeed—But this shall—</L>
<STAGE>(Attempts to kill himself, Siward wrests the sword from him.</STAGE>
<L>Ha! disarm'd!</L>
<L>But coward guilt is weak as infancy;</L>
<L>It was not so before I murder'd Edwin.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIWARD.</SPEAKER>
<L>The murd'rer's punishment shou'd be to live,</L>
<L>And shall be thine; thou know'st not half thy guilt,</L>
<L>Nor half thy sorrows: I shall rend thy soul.</L>
<L>Prepare thee for another deeper wound;</L>
<L>And know that Edwin lov'd thee, in his hand,</L>
<L>Whilst mine was lifted up for his destruction,</L>
<L>I found this paper, 'tis the counterpart</L>
<L>Of one he had dispatch'd to William, read it</L>
<L>And tremble at thy complicated guilt.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(taking the paper.)</STAGE>
<L>What's here? He pleads my pardon with the king,</L>
<L>Ascribes my frantic zeal, in Edgar's cause,</L>
<L>To ill-advis'd warmth, and recommends</L>
<L>His—murderer to mercy: Horrid thought!</L>
<L>I am the vilest, most abandon'd slave</L>
<L>That e'er disgrac'd humanity—O, Siward!</L>
<L>If thou hast yet, among the dying embers</L>
<L>Of our long friendship, one remaining spark</L>
<L>Of kind compassion for the wretched Morcar,</L>
<L>Lend me thy aid to shake off the sad load</L>
<L>Of hated life that presses sore upon me.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIWARD.</SPEAKER>
<L>Tho' thou'rt no longer worthy of my friendship,</L>
<L>Deaf to the cries of nature, and the voice</L>
<L>Of holy truth, that wou'd have council'd thee</L>
<L>To better deeds, yet hath my foolish heart</L>
<L>Some pity for thee—After crimes, like these,</L>
<L>There is but one way left—Say, wilt thou patient wait</L>
<L>Till I return?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="72" REF="81"/>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>I will.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIWARD.</SPEAKER>
<L>Remember, Morcar,</L>
<L>You promis'd me—I have a draught within,</L>
<L>Of wondrous pow'r, that in a moment lulls</L>
<L>The tortur'd soul to sweet forgetfulness</L>
<L>Of all its woes: I'll haste and bring it thee,</L>
<L>'Twill give thee rest and peace.</L>
<STAGE>[Exit Siward.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>I hope for ever.</L>
<L>But where's the lost Matilda? who shall comfort</L>
<L>That dear unhappy maid, whom I have robb'd</L>
<L>Of ev'ry bliss. O, save me from the sight,</L>
<L>Ye pitying pow'rs!</L>
<STAGE>Enter MATILDA.</STAGE>
<L>She comes—distraction!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>O!</L>
<L>My Lord, permit—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>Away—I know thee not.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Not know me! 'tis the poor distress'd Matilda,</L>
<L>Who comes to ask forgiveness for the rage</L>
<L>Of frantic love; the madness of despair,</L>
<L>That urg'd me to such wrath and bitterness</L>
<L>Of keen reproach; but pardon— <STAGE>(kneels)</STAGE></L>
<L>Gen'rous Morcar,</L>
<L>A woman's weakness: Speak and make me blest.</L>
<L>Alas! he hears me not.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>Matilda, rise;</L>
<L>I pray thee leave me— <STAGE>(weeps)</STAGE></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="73" REF="82"/>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Gracious heav'n! he weeps;</L>
<L>Propitious omen! O, my Lord! those tears</L>
<L>Are the soft marks of sympathizing woe,</L>
<L>And seem to say, I shall not plead in vain.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>Ask what thou wilt, for know, so dear I hold</L>
<L>Matilda's happiness, that, here I swear</L>
<L>If all the kingdoms of the peopled earth</L>
<L>Were mine to give, I'd lay them at her feet:</L>
<L>But much I fear they wou'd not make her happy.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Alas! my Lord Matilda's happiness</L>
<L>Is center'd all in one dear precious jewel;</L>
<L>'Tis in <HI>thy</HI> keeping—Edwin—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>What of him?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Is innocent.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>I know it.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Just and good;</L>
<L>He never meant to injure thee, indeed</L>
<L>He did not.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>I believe it, for his nature</L>
<L>Was ever mild and gentle.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Good, my Lord,</L>
<L>You mock me.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>No, Matilda; speak, go on,</L>
<L><PB N="74" REF="83"/>
And praise him: I cou'd talk to thee for ever</L>
<L>Of Edwin's virtues—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Then thou wou'd'st not hurt</L>
<L>His precious life, thou wou'd'st not—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>I wou'd give</L>
<L>A thousand worlds to save him.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Wou'd'st thou? then</L>
<L>My pray'rs are heard, thou hast forgiv'n all,</L>
<L>And I am happy. Speak, is Edwin free?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>From ev'ry care—wou'd I were half so blest!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>What mean you? Ha! thy eyes are fixt with horror,</L>
<L>Thy looks are wild. What hast thou done? O! speak.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>Matilda, if thou com'st for Edwin's life,</L>
<L>It is too late—for Edwin is no more.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>And is my Edwin slain?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>Aye: Basely murder'd.</L>
<L>O! 'twas the vilest, most unnat'ral deed</L>
<L>That ever—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Blasted be the cruel hand</L>
<L>That dealt the blow! O, may his guilty heart</L>
<L>Ne'er taste of balmy peace, or sweet repose!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>But ever, by the vulture conscience, torn;</L>
<L>Bleed inward, still unpity'd, till he seek</L>
<L>For refuge in the grave.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="75" REF="84"/>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Nor find it there.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis well: Thy curses are accomplish'd all;</L>
<L>I feel 'em here within—for know—'twas I.</L>
<L>I gave the fatal order, and my friend,</L>
<L>My Siward, has too faithfully perform'd it.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Siward! impossible! There dwells not then</L>
<L>In human breast, or truth or virtue—O!</L>
<L>Unnat'ral brother!—but I will be calm.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>Alas! thy fate is happiness to mine;</L>
<L>For thou art innocent.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>And soon, I hope</L>
<L>To be rewarded for it. O! my Edwin,</L>
<L>Matilda soon shall follow thee—thou think'st</L>
<L>I am unarm'd, deserted; doom'd like thee</L>
<L>To hated life; but know, I have a friend,</L>
<L>A bosom-friend, and prompt, as thine, to enter</L>
<L>On any bloody service I command.</L>
<STAGE>(Draws a dagger.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>Command it then for justice, for revenge,</L>
<L>Behold! my bosom rises to the blow;</L>
<L>Strike here, and end a wretched murd'rer—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>No;</L>
<L>That were a mercy thou hast not deserv'd;</L>
<L>I shall not seek revenge in Morcar's death,</L>
<L>In mine thou shalt be wretched—</L>

<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>Stop, Matilda—</L>
<L>Stop thy rash hand, the weight of Edwin's blood</L>
<L>Sits heavy on my heart. O! do not pierce it</L>
<L>With added guilt.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>No more, I must be gone</L>
<L>To meet my Edwin, who already chides</L>
<L>My ling'ring steps, and beckons me away</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yet hear me! O! if penitence and pray'r,</L>
<L>If deep contrition, sorrow and remorse</L>
<L>Cou'd bring him back to thy desiring eyes,</L>
<L>O! with what rapture wou'd I yield him now</L>
<L>To thee, Matilda—bear me witness—Ha! <STAGE>(starts)</STAGE></L>
<L>'Tis he—Look up dear injur'd maid—he comes</L>
<L>To claim my promise.</L>

<L>It is, it is my Edwin!</L>

<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>O unexpected bliss! what gracious hand—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIWARD.</SPEAKER>
<L>Behold the cordial draught I promis'd you!</L>
<L>I knew thy noble nature, when the storm</L>
<L>Of passion had subsided, wou'd abhor</L>
<L>A deed so impious—'Tis the only time</L>
<L>That Siward ever did deceive his friend.</L>
<L>Can'st thou forgive?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>Forgive thee! O thou art</L>
<L>My guardian angel, sent by gracious heav'n</L>
<L>To save me from perdition. O, my brother!</L>
<L>I blush to stand before thee—wilt thou take</L>
<L>From thse polluted hands one precious gift?</L>
<L><PB N="77" REF="86"/>
'Twill make thee full amends for all thy wrongs.</L>
<L>Accept her, and be happy.</L>
<STAGE>(he joins the hands of Edwin and Matilda, then turning to Siward)</STAGE>
<L>That vile slave</L>
<L>Whom I employ'd—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIWARD.</SPEAKER>
<L>I guess'd his horrid purpose,</L>
<L>Watch'd ev'ry step, and as the villain aim'd</L>
<L>His ponyard at the guiltless Edwin's breast,</L>
<L>Turn'd sudden round, and plung'd it in his own.</L>
<L>The bloody corse was dragg'd—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>I know the rest.</L>
<L>O, Siward! from what weight of endless woe</L>
<L>Hath thy blest hand preserv'd me!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDWIN.</SPEAKER>
<L>O, my Matilda! how shall we repay</L>
<L>Our noble benefactor? Much I owe</L>
<L>To gallant Siward, but to Morcar more:</L>
<L>Tou gav'st me life, but my kind, gen'rous brother</L>
<L>Enhanc'd the gift, and bless'd me with Matilda.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MATILDA, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(to Morcar.)</STAGE>
<L>Words are too poor to thank thee as I ought;</L>
<L>Accept this tribute of a grateful heart,</L>
<L>These tears of joy; and, O! may ev'ry curse</L>
<L>My frantic grief for Edwin pour'd upon thee,</L>
<L>Be chang'd to dearest blessings on thy head!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>Alas! thy blessings cannot reach me. Guilt</L>
<L>May plead for pardon, but can never boast</L>
<L>A claim to happiness: I only ask</L>
<L><PB N="78" REF="87"/>
A late forgiveness. If a life of sorrow,</L>
<L>And deep remorse, can wash my crimes away,</L>
<L>Let 'em be bury'd with me in oblivion,</L>
<L>And do not curse the memory of—Morcar.</L>
<STAGE>(turning to Edwin.</STAGE>
<L>O, Edwin! say, can'st thou forgive the crime</L>
<L>Of frantic love, of madness and despair?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDWIN.</SPEAKER>
<L>As in my latest hour from heav'n I hope</L>
<L>Its kind indulgence for my errors past,</L>
<L>Ev'n so, my brother, from my soul I pardon</L>
<L>And pity thee.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>Then I shall die in peace.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDWIN.</SPEAKER>
<L>Talk not of death, my brother, thou must live</L>
<L>To see our happiness complete, to hear</L>
<L>My sweet Matilda pour forth all her heart</L>
<L>In rap'rous thanks to thee, and to thy friend;</L>
<L>And grateful Edwin bless thee for thy bounties.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORCAR.</SPEAKER>
<L>It must not be: I know too much already,</L>
<L>Of Morcar's weakness, and Matilda's pow'r</L>
<L>They are not to be trusted. No, my Edwin,</L>
<L>Morcar shall never interrupt thy joys.</L>
<L>Far from thy fight and from the haunts of men,</L>
<L>In some deep distant solitude retir'd,</L>
<L>To pious sorrow will I dedicate</L>
<L>My short remains of wretched life, and strive</L>
<L>To make my peace with heav'n and wrong'd Matilda.</L>
<L>And if perchance in after-times some bard,</L>
<L>Struck with the native horrors of my tale,</L>
<L>Shou'd bid th' historic muse record it—let him</L>
<L><PB N="79" REF="88"/>
By <HI>my</HI> example teach a future age,</L>
<L>The dire effects of loose, unbridled rage;</L>
<L>Teach thoughtless men their passions to controul,</L>
<L>And curb the sallies of th'impetuous soul,</L>
<L>Lest they experience worse than Morcar's woe,</L>
<L>Nor find a Siward—to prevent the blow.</L>
