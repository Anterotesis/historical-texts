<HEAD>ACCOUNT of Mrs. SIDDONS's first Reception in DUBLIN.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When this whimsical Account first appeared in Dublin, the Lady's friends were outrageous against the Author. The Hu∣mourist kept himself snug while a number of Literary Irishmen in London and Dublin were claiming the praise due to him, which indeed they have continued to do to this hour, though the pleasant fugitive is now well known to be the offspring of the facetious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> ON Saturday Mrs. Siddons, about whom all the World has been talking, exposed her beautiful, adamantine, soft, and lovely Person for the first time at the Theatre Royal, Smock-Alley, in the bewitch∣ing, melting and all-tearful Character of Isabella. From the repeated panegyrics in the impartial Lon∣don News-papers, we were taught to expect the sight of an heavenly Angel, but how were we supernaturally surprised into the most awful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at beholding a mortal Goddess!</P>
<P>The house was crowded with hundreds more than it could hold, with thousands of admiring spectators that went away without a sight. This extraordinary Phaenomenon of Tragic excellence! this Star of Melpomene! this Comet of the Stage! this Sun of the firmament of the Muses! this Moon of blank verse! this Queen and Princess of tears! this Donnellan of the poisoned bowl! this Empress <HI>Rusty Fusty</HI> of the pistol and dagger! this Chao of
<PB N="vi" REF="4"/>
Shakespeare! this World of weeping clouds! this Juno of commanding aspect! this Terpsichore of the curtain and scenes! this Proserpine of fire and earthquake! this Katterfelto of wonders, exceeded expectation, went beyond belief, and soared above all the powers of description! She was Nature itself!—She was the most exquisite work of art! She was the very daisy, primrose, tube-rose, sweet-briar, surze-blossom, gilliflower, wall-flower, cauliflower, auricula, and rosemary; in short, she was the Bouquet of Parnassus!</P>
<P>Where expectation was raised so high, it was thought she would be injured by her appearance— but it was the audience who were injured. Several fainted even before the curtain drew up!—but when she came to the scene of parting with her. wedding-ring, ah! what a sight was there! The very sidiers in the Orchestra, albeit, unused to melting mood, blubbered like hungry children crying for their bread and butter; and when the bell rang for music between the acts, the tears ran from the bas∣soon player's eyes in such plentiful showers, that they choaked the finger stops, and making a spout of the instrument, poured in such a torrent on the first fidler's book, that not seeing the Overture was in two sharps, the leader of the band actually played in one flat.</P>
<P>But the sobs and sighs of the groaning audience, and the noise of the corks drawn from the smelling-bottles, prevented the mistake between the flats and the sharps being discovered.</P>
<P>One hundred and nine ladies fainted! forty-six went into fits! and ninety-five had strong hysterics! The world will scarcely credit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> when they are told that fourteen children, five old women, a one-handed sailor, and six common-council men,
<PB N="vii" REF="5"/>
were actually drowned in the inundation of tears that flowed from the galleries, lattices, and boxes, to encrease the briny pond in the pit. The water was three feet deep, and the people that were ob∣liged to stand upon the benches, were in that po∣sition up to their ankles in tears!</P>
<P>An Act of Parliament against her playing any more will certainly pass, for she has infected all the Volunteers, and they sit reading the Fatal Marriage, crying and roaring the whole morning, at the ex∣pectation of seeing this Giant's Causeway, this Salmon Leap of wonders at night! An address has been presented to the good Earl of Charlemont by the principal Volunteers, and backed by Doctor Quin and the Faculty of Dublin, praying him to stay at home the evening of her appearance, else they are convinced she'll tear his infirm frame in pieces with her terrific screams, when she's dragged from the corpse of Biron, and they'll lose the greatest General that ever headed an army. Nature, must assuredly, in one of her bountiful moments, in one of her charitable and humane leisure hours, in one of her smiling days, in one of her happy weeping months, and in one of her all-sorrowing gladsome years, made this human lump of clayey perfection!</P>
<P>Oh! happy Hibernia, blessed Ierne, sanctified land of Saints, what a hearse load, what a coffin full, what a church-yard tree of the brightest ex∣cellence of excellencies now stands on the turf of thy fruitful earth!</P>
<P>From Cork, from Kilarney, from Galway, from Ballinasloe, from Eyrecourt, from the East, from the West, from the North, from the South, from Island Bridge, from Lazor's-Hill, from the banks of the Canal to the New Road, at the back of
<PB N="viii" REF="6"/>
Drumcondra, shall millions come to Smock-Alley, to see this astonishing woman!</P>
<P>The streets round the Theatre shall be crowded, and the very Gabbards that carry coals to Island Bridge shall stop at the Blind-Quay, and land their unpolished Watermen to spend thirteen-pence for a seat in the upper gallery when Isabella is per∣formed!</P>
<P>O thou universal Genius, what pity it is that thy talents are so confined to Tragedy alone! No age— nay, the Roman Theatre, the Stage at Constantino∣ple—Nero himself never performed the scene of madness, of grief, of joy, of woe, of distress, of sorrow, and of pity, so well as Mrs. Siddons!</P>
<P>May the curses of an insulted nation pursue the gentlemen of the College, the gentlemen of the Bar, and the Peers and Peeresses, whose wisdom and discernment have been so highly extolled, that hissed her on the second night. True it is, Mr. Garrick never could make any thing of her, and pronounced her below mediocrity—true it is, the London audience once did not like her; but what of that? Rise up bright Goddess of the Sock and Buskin, and soar to unknown Regions of immortal Praise, for</P>
<P>"Envy will merit as its shade pursue."</P>
