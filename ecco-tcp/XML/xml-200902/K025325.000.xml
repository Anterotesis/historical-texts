<P>I HAVE two motives for inscribing this piece to you, gratitude and vanity; gra∣titude, because it's success has been greatly owing to your judicious advice; and vanity, because I wish to acquaint the world that such a character as <HI>Mr. Garrick,</HI> has been warmly the friend of his sincerely affectionate,</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Written by DAVID GARRICK, Esq.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Kelly originally intended the prologue to be grave, and accor∣dingly wrote a serious one himself; but as Mr. King was to speak it, Mr. Garrick, with great propriety, thought a piece of humour would be best suited to the talents of that excellent actor, and therefore very kindly took the trouble of putting it into a form so entirely different from the first, that it cannot, with the least justice, be attributed to any other author.</NOTE></BYLINE>
<STAGE>Spoken by Mr. KING.</STAGE>
<SP>
<L>I'M vex'd—quite vex'd — and you'll be vex'd—that's worse;</L>
<L>To deal with <HI>stubborn scribblers!</HI> there's the curse!</L>
<L>Write <HI>moral</HI> plays — the blockhead! — why, good people,</L>
<L>You'll soon expect this house to wear a steeple!</L>
<L>For our fine piece, to let you into facts,</L>
<L>Is quite a <HI>Sermon,</HI> — only preach'd in <HI>Acts.</HI></L>
<L>You'll scarce believe me, 'till the proof appears,</L>
<L>But even I, Tom Fool, must shed some tears:</L>
<L>Do, Ladies, lock upon me — nay, no simp'ring —</L>
<L>Think you this face was ever made for whimp'ring?</L>
<L>Can I, a cambrick handkerchief display, —</L>
<L>Thump my unfeeling breast, and roar away?</L>
<L>Why <HI>this</HI> is <HI>comical,</HI> perhaps he'll say —</L>
<L>Resolving this strange aukward bard to pump,</L>
<L>I ask'd him what he meant? — He somewhat plump,</L>
<L>New purs'd his belly, and his lips thus biting,</L>
<L><HI>I must keep up the dignity of writing!</HI></L>
<L>You may, but, if you do, Sir, I must tell ye,</L>
<L>You'll not keep up that dignity of belly;</L>
<L>Still he preach'd on. — "<HI>Bards of a former age</HI></L>
<L><HI>Held up abandon'd pictures on the stage,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Spread out their wit, with facinating art,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And catch'd the fancy, to corrupt the heart;</HI></L>
<L><HI>But happy change! — in these more moral days,</HI></L>
<L><HI>You cannot sport with virtue, even in plays;</HI></L>
<L><HI>On virtue's side, his pen the poet draws,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And boldly asks a hearing for his cause."</HI></L>
<L>Thus did he prance, and swell. — The man may prate,</L>
<L>And feed these whimsies in his addle pate,</L>
<L>That you'll protect his muse, because she's good,</L>
<L>A virgin, and so chaste! — O Lud! O' Lud!</L>
<L>No muse the Critic Beadle's lash escapes,</L>
<L>Though virtuous, if a dowdy, and a trapes:</L>
<L>If <HI>his</HI> come forth, a decent likely Lass,</L>
<L>You'll speak her fair, and grant the proper pass;</L>
<L>Or should his brain be turn'd with wild pretences;</L>
<L>In three hours time, you'll bring him to his senses;</L>
<L>And well you may, when in your power you get him,</L>
<L>In that short space, you blister, bleed, and sweat him.</L>
<L>Among the <HI>Turks,</HI> indeed, he'd run no danger,</L>
<L>They sacred hold a <HI>madman,</HI> and a <HI>stranger.</HI></L>

<P><HI>An Apartment at</HI> Lady BETTY LAMBTON'S.</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> SIDNEY <HI>and</HI> WINWORTH.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIDNEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>STILL I can't help thinking but Lady Betty Lambton's refusal was infinitely more the result of an extraordinary delicacy, than the want of affection for your Lordship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WINWORTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>O my dear cousin you are very much mistaken; I am not one of those coxcombs who imagine a woman does'nt know her own mind, or who, be∣cause they are treated with civility by a lady who has rejected their addresses, suppose she is secretly debating in their favour: Lady Betty is a woman of sense, and must consequently despise coquetry or affectation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIDNEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why she always speaks of you with the greatest respect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>WINWORTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Respect! — Why she always speaks of you with the greatest respect; does it therefore follow that she loves you? No Charles — I have, for some time you know, ceas'd to trouble Lady Betty with my solicitations, and I see myself honour'd with her friendship, though I hav'nt been so hap∣py as to merit her heart; for this reason I have no doubt of her assistance on the present occasion, and I am certain I shall please her by making my addresses to Miss Marchmont.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIDNEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Miss Marchmont is indeed a very deserving young woman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WINWORTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Next to Lady Betty I never saw one so form'd to my wishes; besides, during the whole period of my fruitless attendance, she seemed so interested for my success, and express'd so hearty a concern for my disappointment, that I have consider'd her with an eye of more than common friendship ever since. — But what's the matter with you Charles, you seem to have something upon your spirits?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIDNEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed my Lord you are mistaken, I am only attentive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WINWORTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, is that all! — This very day I purpose to request Lady Betty's interest with Miss March∣mont, for unhappily circumstanc'd as she is, with regard to fortune, she possesses an uncommon share of delicacy, and may possibly think herself
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>insulted by the offer of a rejected heart; — Lady Betty in that case will save her the pain of a supposed disrespect, and me the mortification of a new repulse. But I beg your pardon, Charles, I am forgetting the cause of friendship, and shall now step up stairs to Colonel Rivers about your affair. — Ah Sidney you have no difficulties to obstruct the completion of your wishes, and a few days must make you one of the happist men in England.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[Exit.]</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIDNEY.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[looking after him.]</STAGE>
<P>A few days make me one of the happiest men in England, — a likely matter truly; little does he know how I passionately admire the very wo∣man to whom he is immediately going with an offer of his person and fortune. — The marriage with Miss Rivers I see is unavoidable, and I am almost pleased that I never obtained any encou∣ragement from Miss Marchmont, as I should now be reduc'd to the painful alternative, either of giving up my own hopes, or of opposing the happiness of such a friend.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Mrs. HARLEY <HI>and</HI> Miss MARCHMONT.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>O here my dear girl is the sweet swain in <HI>pro∣pria persona:</HI> — Only mind what a funeral sermon∣face the creature has, notwithstanding the agree∣able prospects before him. — Well of all things in the world defend me I say from a sober husband!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIDNEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are extreamly welcome Mrs. Harley to divert yourself—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>He speaks too in as melancholy a tone as a passing bell: — Lord, lord, what can Colonel Rivers see in the wretch to think of him for a son-in-law. — Only look Miss Marchmont at this love-exciting countenance; — Observe the Cu∣pids that ambush in these eyes; — These lips to be sure are fraught with the honey of Hybla: — Go you lifeless devil you, — go try to get a little animation into this unfortunate face of yours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIDNEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word my face is very much oblig'd to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss MARCHMONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are a mad creature, my dear, and yet I envy your spirits prodigiously.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so you ought. — But for all that you and Lady Betty are unaccountably fond of those half-soul'd fellows, who are as mechanically regular as so many pieces of clock-work, and never strike above once an hour upon a new observation — who are so sentimental, and so dull — so wise and so drowsy. — Why I thought Lady Betty had al∣ready a sufficient quantity of lead in her family without taking in this lump to increase the weight of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss MARCHMONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>What can she posibly mean, Mr. Sidney.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIDNEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis impossible to guess madam. The lively widow will still have her laugh without sparing any body.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why surely, my dear, you can't forget the coun∣ter part of poor dismal here, that elaborate piece of dignified dulness, Lady Betty's cousin Lord Hectic; who through downright fondness is con∣tinually plaguing his poor wife, and rendering her the most miserable woman in the world, from an extraordinary desire of promoting her happi∣ness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss MARCHMONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is'nt there a great deal to say in exte∣nuation of an error which proceeds from a prin∣ciple of real affection?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Affection! ridiculous! but you shall have an instance of this wonderful affection: — T'other day I din'd at his house, and, though the wea∣ther was intollerably warm, the table was laid in a close room, with a fire large enough to roast an ox for a country corporation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIDNEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and so —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>In a great chair, near the fire side, sat poor Lady Hectic, wrapp'd up in as many fur cloaks as would bassle the severity of a winter in Sibe∣ria: —On my entrance I express'd a proper con∣cern for her illness, and ask'd the nature of her complaint. — She told me she complain'd of no∣thing but the weight of her dress, and the in∣tollerable heat of the apartment; adding, that she had been caught in a little shower the pre∣ceding
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>evening, which terrisied Lord Hectic out of his wits, and so for fear she might run the chance of a slight cold, he exposed her to the hazard of absolute suffocation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIDNEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word, Miss Marchmont, she has a pretty manner of turning things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss MARCHMONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really I think so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well — unable to bear either the tyranny of this preposterous fondness any longer, or the intollerable heat of his room, I made my escape the moment the cloth was removed, and shan't be surprised if before the conclusion of the summer, he is brought before his peers for having murdered his poor lady out of downright affection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIDNEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very uncommon death, Mrs. Harley, among people of quality.</P>

<P>Lord Winworth, Sir, desires the favour of your company above: the person is come with the writings from the Temple—</P>

<P>I'll wait upon him immediately.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay pray do, you are the fittest company in the world for each other. — If Colonel Rivers was of my mind he'd turn you instantly adrift and listen to the overtures of Sir Harry Newburg.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIDNEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I really believe you have a fancy to me your∣self, you're so constantly abusing me.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.]</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I, you odious creature!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss MARCHMONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now you mention Sir Harry, my dear, is'nt it rather extraordinary for him to think about Miss Rivers, when he knows of the engagements between her and Mr. Sidney — especially as her father has such an objection to the wildness of his character.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>What you are still at your sober reflections I see, and are for scrutinizing into the morals of a lover.—The women truly would have a fine time of it if they were never to be married till they found men of unexceptionable characters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss MARCHMONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay I don't want to lessen Sir Harry's merit in the least, — he has his good qualities as well as his faults — and is no way destitute of under∣standing — but still his understanding is a fashi∣onable one, and pleads the knowledge of every thing right, to justify the practice of many things not strictly warrantable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="14"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I never heard any thing to his prejudice but some fashionable liberties which he has taken with the ladies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss MARCHMONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>And in the name of wonder what wou'd you desire to hear?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, Hortensia, we women are unac∣countable creatures, the greatest number of us by much love a fellow for having a little modish wildness about him, and if we are such fools as to be captivated with the vices of the men, we ought to be punished for the depravity of our sentiments.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> RIVERS <HI>and</HI> Lady BETTY.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you sister they can read the parchments very well without our assistance — and I have been so fatigu'd with looking over papers all the morning, that I am heartily sick of your Indentures, witnessing, your forasmuch's, likewise's also's, moreover's and notwithstanding's, and I must take a turn in the garden to recover myself.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[Exit.]</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay I only spoke because I imagin'd our being present would be more agreeable to Lord Win∣worth. — But I wonder Sir Harry does'nt come, he promised to be here by ten, and I want to see his cousin Cecil mightily.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="15"/>
<SPEAKER>Miss MARCHMONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, Lady Betty, does Mr. Cecil come with him here this morning?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>He does, my dear — he arrived at Sir Harry's last night, and I want to see if his late journey to France has any way improved the elegance of his appearance.</P>
<STAGE>[ironically.]</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I shall be glad to see him too; for, not∣withstanding his disregard of dress, and freedom of manner — there is a something right in him that pleases me prodigiously.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss MARCHMONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>A something right, Mrs. Harley! — he is one of the worthiest creatures in the world.</P>
</SP>

<P>O, Hortensia, he ought to be a favourite of yours, for I don't know any body who possesses a higher place in his good opinion.</P>

<SPEAKER>Miss MARCHMONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Twou'd be odd, indeed, if he was'nt a fa∣vourite of mine — he was my father's best friend; — gave him a considerable living you know, and, when he died, wou'd have provided very kindly for me, if your generosity, Lady Betty, had'nt render'd his goodness wholly unnecessary.</P>

<P>Did you meet any of them at Paris?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CECIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did, — and, what was worse, I met them in every town I passed through; — but the English are a great commercial nation, you know, and their fools like their broad cloths, are exported in large quantities to all parts of Europe.</P>

<P>Ah, widow, there are many heads in this coun∣try with much more extraordinary things upon them than my unfortunate shock of hair, as you call it: — what do you think of these wings, for instance, that cover the ears of my cousin Mer∣cury?</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Colonel, your most obedient: — I am come upon the old business; —for unless I am allow'd to entertain hope of Miss Rivers, I shall be the most miserable of human beings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Harry, I have already told you by letter, and I now tell you personally, I cannot listen to your proposals.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir, — I have promised my daughter to Mr. Sidney; — do you know that, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do; — but what then? Engagements of this kind, you know —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>So then, you do know I have promised her to Mr. Sidney?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="15" REF="21"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do; — but I also know that matters are not finally settled between Mr. Sidney and you, and I moreover know, that his fortune is by no means equal to mine, therefore —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Harry, let me ask you one question before you make your consequence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>A thousand if you please, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, Sir, let me ask you, what you have ever observed in me or my conduct, that you de∣sire me so familiarly to break my word: — I thought, Sir, you considered me as a man of honour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so I do, Sir, a man of the nicest honour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, Sir, you ask me to violate the sanctity of my word — and tell me indirectly that it is my interest to be a rascal —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I really don't understand you, Colonel: — I thought, when I was talking to you I was talk∣ing to a man who knew the world — and as you have not yet signed —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, this is mending matters with a witness! — And so you think because I am not legally bound, I am under no necessity of keeping my word! — Sir Harry, laws were never made for men of honour; — they want no bond but the
<PB N="16" REF="22"/>rectitude of their own sentiments, and laws are of no use but to bind the villains of society.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well! but my dear Colonel, if you have no regard for me, shew some little regard for your daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Harry, I shew the greatest regard for my daughter by giving her to a man of honour; — and I must not be insulted with any farther repetition of your proposals.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Insult you Colonel! — is the offer of my al∣liance an insult? — is my readiness to make what settlements you think proper —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Harry, I should consider the offer of a kingdom an insult, if it was to be purchased by the violation of my word: — Besides, though my daughter shall never go a beggar to the arms of her husband, I wou'd rather see her happy than rich; and if she has enough to provide handsome∣ly for a young family, and something to spare for the exigencies of a worthy friend, I shall think her as affluent as if she was mistress of Mexico.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Colonel, I have done; — but I believe —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir Harry, and as our conference is done, we will, if you please, retire to the ladies: — I shall be always glad of your acquaintance though I can't receive you as a son-in-law, — for a union of interest I look upon as a union of dishonour, and consider a marriage for money, at best, but a legal prostitution.</P>

<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Lady BETTY, <HI>and</HI> Mrs. HARLEY.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>LORD, Lord, my dear you're enough to drive one out of one's wits. — I tell you, again and again, he's as much yours as ever; and was I in your situation, he shou'd be my husband to-morrow morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Emmy you mistake the matter strangely. — Lord Winworth is no common man, nor wou'd he have continued his silence so long upon his favourite subject, if he had the least inclination to renew his addresses. — His pride has justly taken the alarm at my insensibility, and he will not, I am satisfied, run the hazard of another refusal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, in the name of wonder, if he was so dear to you, cou'd you prodigally trifle with your own happiness, and repeatedly refuse him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have repeatedly told you because I was a fool, Emmy. — Till he withdrew his addresses I knew not how much I esteemed him; my unhappiness in my first marriage, you know, made me resolve against another. — And you are also sensible I have frequently argued that a woman of real de∣licacy shou'd never admit a second impression on her heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="18" REF="24"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and I always thought you argued very foolishly. — I am sure I ought to know, for I have been twice married; — and though I lov'd my first husband very sincerely, there was not a woman in England who cou'd have made the second a better wife. — Nay, for that matter, if another was to offer himself to-morrow, I am not altogether certain that I should refuse listening —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are a strange creature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And are'nt you a much stranger, in declining to follow your own inclinations, when you cou'd have consulted them so highly, to the credit of your good sense, and the satisfaction of your whole family. — But it is'nt yet too late; and if you will be advised by me every thing shall end as happily as you can wish.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, let me hear your advice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why this, then: — My Lord you know has requested that you wou'd indulge him with half an hour's private conversation some time this morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is a liberty he has'nt taken these three months — and he must design something by it; — now as he can design nothing but to renew his addresses, I wou'd advise you to take
<PB N="19" REF="25"/>him at the very first word, for fear your delicacy, if it has time to consider, shou'd again shew you the strange impropriety of second marriages.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>But suppose this should not be his business with me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then we'll go another way to work: — I, as a sanguine friend of my Lord's, can give him a distant hint of matters, exacting at the same time a promise of the most inviolable secrecy; and assuring him you wou'd never forgive me, if you had the least idea of my having acquainted him with so important a —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so you wou'd have me —?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not? — This is the very step I shou'd take myself, if I was in your situation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>May be so: — But it's a step which I shall never take. — What! wou'd you have me lost to all feeling? Wou'd you have me meanly make use of chambermaid artifices for a husband?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY:</SPEAKER>
<P>I would only have you happy my dear: — And where the man of one's heart is at stake I don't think we ought to stand so rigidly upon trifles. —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Trifles, Emmy! do you call the laws of de∣licacy trifles. — She that violates these —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="20" REF="26"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poh! poh! she that violates: — What a work there is with you sentimental folks. — Why, don't I tell you that my Lord shall never know any thing of your concern in the design?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>But sha'nt I know it myself, Emmy! — and how can I escape the justice of my own reflections!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, thank heav'n my sentiments are not suf∣ficiently refin'd to make me unhappy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't change my sentiments, my dear Emmy, — nor wou'd I, if I cou'd: — Of this, however, be certain, that unless I have Lord Winworth without courting him, I shall never have him at all. — But be silent to all the world upon this matter I conjure you: — Particularly to Miss Marchmont; for she has been so strenuous an advocate for my Lord, that the concealment of it from her might give her some doubts of my friendship; and I shou'd be continually uneasy for fear my reserve shou'd be consider'd as an indirect insult upon her circumstances.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, the devil take this delicacy; I don't know any thing it does besides making people miserable: — And yet some how, foolish as it is, one can't help liking it. — But yonder I see Sir Harry and Mr. Cecil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us withdraw then my dear; they may de∣tain us; and, 'till this interview is over, I shall
<PB N="21" REF="27"/>be in a continual agitation; yet I am strangely apprehensive of a disappointment, Emmy — and if —</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>CECIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, did'nt I tell you the moment you opened this affair to me, that the Colonel was a man of too much sense to give his daughter to a cox∣comb?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what if I should tell you, that his daugh∣ter shall be still mine, and in spite of his teeth?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CECIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee explain kinsman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why suppose Miss Rivers should have no very strong objection to this unfortunate figure of mine?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CECIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why even your vanity can't think that a young lady of her good sense, can possibly be in love with you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="22" REF="28"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, you think that no likely circumstance I see?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CECIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do really — Formerly indeed the women were fools enough to be caught by the frippery of externals, and so a fellow neither picked a pocket, nor put up with an affront, he was a dear toad — a sweet creature — and a wicked devil; — nay the wicked devil, was quite an an∣gel of a man — and like another Alexander, in proportion to the number of wretches which he made, he constantly increased the lustre of his reputation — till at last, having conquered all his worlds, he sat down with that celebrated ruffian, and wept because he cou'd commit no farther outrages upon society.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>O my good moralizing cousin, you'll find your self cursedly out in your politics; and I shall convince you in a few hours, that a handsome suit on the back of a sprightly young fellow, will still do more among the women, than all your sentiment and slovenliness. —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CECIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>What wou'd you persuade me that Miss Rivers will go off with you —?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have hit the mark for once in your life, my sweet temper'd mouther of morality — The dear Theodora —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CECIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>The dear Theodora! and so Harry you ima∣gine that by the common maxims of fashionable
<PB N="23" REF="29"/>life, you may appear to be a friend to the Colo∣nel at the very moment you are going to rob him of his daughter. — For shame kinsman — for shame — have some pride if you have no virtue — and dont smile in a man's face when you want to do him the greatest of all injuries — dont Harry —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Cecil I scorn a base action as much as you or as much as any man — but I love Miss Rivers honourably. — I ask nothing from her father, and as her person is her own she has a right to be∣stow it where she pleases.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CECIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am answered — her person is her own — and she has a right to be miserable her own way. — I acknowledge it — and will not discover your secret to her father. —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Discover it to her father — why sure you woud'nt think of it. — Take care Cecil — take care — I do indeed love you better than any man in the world — and I know you have a friendship, a cordial friendship for me — but the happiness of my whole life is at stake, and must not be de∣stroyed by any of your unaccountable peculiarities.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CECIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Harry — you know I wou'd at any time rather promote your happiness than obstruct it. — And you also know that if I die without children — you shall have a principal part of my fortune; — but damn it — I wish you had not used the mask of friendship to steal this young Lady away from her relations — 'tis hard that their good nature
<PB N="24" REF="30"/>must be turned against their peace; — and hard, because her whole family treat you with regard, that you should offer them the greatest insult ima∣ginable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Cecil, I am more to be pitied than con∣demned in this transaction. — when I first endea∣voured to make myself agreeable to Miss Rivers, I imagined her family would readily countenance my addresses, and when I succeeded in that en∣deavour, I had not time to declare myself in form, before her father entred into this engagement with Sidney. — The moment I heard it mention∣ed, I wrote to him, offering him a <HI>carte blanche,</HI> and this morning a repetition of my offer was treated with contempt. — I have therefore been forc'd into the measure you disapprove so much— but I hope my conduct, in the character of the son-in-law, will amply atone for any error in my behaviour as a friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CECIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well well, we must make the best of a bad market, — her father has no right to force her inclinations; — 'tis equally cruel and unjust; there∣fore you may depend upon my utmost endeavours not only to assist you in carrying her off, but in appeasing all family resentments. — For really, you are so often in the wrong, that one must stand by you a little when you are in the right, — so I shall be ready for you kinsman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Cecil, this is honest — this is really friendly — and you shall abuse me a whole twelvemonth without my answering a syllable —
<PB N="25" REF="31"/>but for the present I must leave you — yonder I see Miss Rivers — we have some little matters to talk of — you understand me — and now —</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.]</STAGE>

<SPEAKER>CECIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>For a torrent of rapture and nonsense. — What egregious puppies does this unaccountable love make of young fellows: Nay, for that matter, what egregious puppies does it not make of old ones? — <HI>ecce signum.</HI> — 'Tis a comfort though, that no body knows I am a puppy in this respect but myself. — Here was I fancying that all the partiality I felt for poor Hortensia Marchmont, proceeded from my friendship for her father — when upon an honest examination into my own heart — I find it principally arises from my regard for herself. — I was in hopes a change of objects would have driven the baggage out of my thoughts, — and I went to France; — but I am come home with a settled resolution of asking her to marry a slovenly rascal of fifty, who is to be sure a very likely swain for a young lady to fall in love with; — but who knows — the most sensible women have sometimes strange tastes; — and yet it must be a very strange taste, that can possibly approve of my overtures. — I'll go cautiously to work however, — and solicit her as for a friend of my own age and fortune; — so that if she refuses me, which is probable enough — I shan't expose myself to her contempt. — What a ridiculous figure is an old fool sighing at the feet of a young woman. — Zounds, I wonder how the grey-headed dotards have the impudence to ask a blooming girl of twenty to throw herself away upon a moving mummy, or a walking skeleton.</P>

<P>Miss Marchmont! my Lord?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WINWORTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Madam, Miss Marchmont. — Since your final disapprobation of those hopes which I was once presumptuous enough to entertain of calling your Ladyship mine, the anguish of a rejected passion has render'd me inconceivably wretched, and I see no way of mitigating the severity of my situation but in the esteem of this amiable woman, who knows how tenderly I have been attached to you, and whose goodness will induce her, I am well convinced, to alleviate, as much as possible, the greatness of my disappointment.</P>
</SP>

<P>Your Lordship is undoubtedly right in your opi∣nion — and I am infinitely concern'd to have been the involuntary cause of uneasiness to you; — but Miss Marchmont, my Lord — she will merit your utmost —</P>

<P>I will not trespass any longer upon your Lady∣ship's leisure, than just to observe, that though I have solicited your friendship on this occasion, I must, nevertheless, beg you will not be too much my friend. — I know Miss Marchmont would make any sacrifice to oblige you; — and if her gratitude should appear in the least concerned, — This is a nice point, my dear Lady Betty, and I must not wound the peace of any person's bosom, to recover the tranquility of my own.</P>

<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Mrs. HARLEY, <HI>who speaks.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<P>Well, my dear, is it all over?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is all over indeed, Emmy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why that sorrowful tone — and melancholly countenance? Must'nt I wish you joy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="32" REF="38"/>
<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, I am the most miserable woman in the world! — Would you believe it? — The busi∣ness of this interview was to request my interest in his favour with Miss Marchmont.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>With Miss Marchmont! — Then there is not one atom of sincere affection in the universe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to that, I have reason to think his senti∣ments for me are as tender as ever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>He gives you a pretty proof of his tenderness, truly, when he asks your assistance to marry ano∣ther woman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Had you but seen his confusion, —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>He might well be confused, when, after court∣ing you these three years, he cou'd think of ano∣ther, and that too at the very moment in which you were ready to oblige him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>There has been a sort of fatality in the affair — and I am punish'd but too justly: — The wo∣man that wants candour where she is address'd by a man of merit, wants a very essential virtue; and she who can delight in the anxiety of a wor∣thy mind, is little to be pitied when she feels the sharpest stings of anxiety in her own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY,</SPEAKER>
<P>But what do you intend to do with regard to this extraordinary request of Lord Winworth; — will you really suffer him to marry Miss March mont?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="33" REF="39"/>
<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why what can I do? If it was improper for me, before I knew any thing of his design in re∣gard to Miss Marchmont, to insinuate the least desire of hearing him again on the subject of his heart, 'tis doubly improper now, when I see he has turn'd his thoughts on another woman, and when this woman, besides, is one of my most valuable friends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, courage Lady Betty — we are'nt yet in a desperate situation — Miss Marchmont loves you — as herself — and woud'nt, I dare say, accept the first man in the world, if it gave you the least uneasiness. — I'll go to her therefore this very moment — tell her at once how the case is — and my life for it, her obligations to you —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stay, Emmy — I conjure you stay — and as you value my peace of mind be for ever silent on this subject. — Miss Marchmont has no obliga∣tions to me; — since our acquaintance I have been the only person obliged; she has given me a power of serving the worthiest young creature in the world, and so far has laid me under the greatest obligation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why my dear —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>But suppose I could be mean enough to think an apartment in my house, a place in my chariot, a seat at my table, and a little annuity in case of my decease, were obligations, when I continu∣ally enjoy such a happiness as her friendship and her company. — Do you think they are obliga∣tions which should make a woman of her fine
<PB N="34" REF="40"/>sense, reject the most amiable man existing, espe∣cially in her circumstances, where he has the ad∣ditional recommendation of an elevated rank and an affluent fortune: — This wou'd be ex∣acting interest with a witness for trifles, and, instead of having any little merit to claim from my behaviour to her, I shou'd be the most in∣exorable of all usurers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well but suppose Miss Marchmont shou'd not like my Lord?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not like him — why will you suppose an im∣possibility?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>But let us suppose it for argument sake.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I cannot say but it would please me above all things: — For still, Emmy, I am a wo∣man, and feel this unexpected misfortune with the keenest sensibility: — It kills me to think of his being another's, but if he must, I wou'd ra∣ther see him her's than any woman's in the uni∣verse. — But I'll talk no more upon this subject, 'till I acquaint her with his proposal; and yet, Emmy, how severe a trial must I go through.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, and you most richly deserve it.</P>

<P>IN close conversation with Sir Harry this half hour, at the remotest part of the garden. — Why, what am I to think of all this. — Does'nt she know I have refused him: — Does'nt she know herself engaged to Sidney? — There's something mean and pitiful in suspicion: — But still there is something that alarms me in this affair; and who knows how far the happiness of my child may be at stake. — Women, after all, are strange things; — they have more sense than we generally allow them — but they have also more vanity. — 'Tis'nt for want of understanding they err, — but through an insatiable love of slattery. — They know very well when they are committing a fault, but destruction wears so bewitching a form, that they rebel against the sense of their own conviction — and never trouble themselves about consequences till they are actully undone. — But here they come, — I don't like this listening: — Yet the meanness of the action must for once be justified by the necessity.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir Harry, you upbraid me very unjustly. — I feel the refusal which my father has given you severely. — Nevertheless I must not consent to you proposal. — An elopement wou'd, I am sure,

<P>Why then, my dear Miss Rivers, woud'nt you give me leave to mention the prepossession with which you honour me to the old Gentleman?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>The old gentleman —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because I was in hopes my father would have listen'd to your application, without putting me to the painful necessity of acknowledging my sentiments in your favour; and because I fear'd that unless the application was approved, on ac∣count of it's intrinsic generosity, there was no∣thing which cou'd possibly work upon the firmness of his temper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well said daughter!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SALLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>The firmness of your father's temper, madam! — The obstinacy you shou'd say! — Sir Harry, as I live and breathe, there is'nt so obstinate, so perverse, and so peevish an old devil in all England.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank you, Mrs. Sally.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sally, I insist that when you speak of my father, you always speak of him with respect. — 'Tis'nt your knowledge of secrets which shall justi∣fy these freedoms; — for I wou'd rather every
<PB N="37" REF="43"/>thing was discovered this minute than hear him mention'd with so impudent a similiarity by his servants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SALLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well Madam, I beg pardon; — but you know the Colonel, where he once determines is never to be alter'd; — so that call this steadiness of temper by what name you please — 'tis likely to make you miserable, unless you embrace the present opportunity, and go off, like a woman of spirit, with the object of your affections.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a damn'd jade it is!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, my dear Miss Rivers, Sally advises you like a true friend; — and I am satisfied your own good sense must secretly argue on her side the question. — The only alternative you have is to fly and be happy — or stay and be miserable: — You have yourself acknowledg'd my ever adorable. —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, damn your adorables!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I say, Madam, you have yourself acknow∣ledg'd that there is no hope whatsoever of work∣ing upon the Colonel's tenderness by acquainting him with our mutual affection: — On the contra∣ry 'tis likely that had he the least suspicion of my being honour'd with your regard, he wou'd drag you instantly to his favourite Sidney, who is so utterly insensible of your merit, — and who, if he has a passion for any body, is, I am confident, devoted to Miss Marchmont.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>This excess of filial affection is extremely amiable: — but it ought by no means to render you forgetful of what is due to yourself. — Con∣sider, Madam, if you have been treated with tenderness, you have repaid that tenderness with duty, and have so far discharged this mighty obligation!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>A pretty method of settling accounts truly!</P>

<SPEAKER>Miss RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't, my dear Sir Harry, speak in this neg∣ligent manner of my father.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>From what I have urg'd you must see, Madam, that though you are so ready to sacrifice your peace for your father, he sets a greater value upon a trifing promise than upon your happiness: —
<PB N="39" REF="45"/>Judge, therefore, whether his repose should be dearer to you, than your own; and judge too whether to prevent the breach of his word, you shou'd vow eternal tenderness to a man you must eternally detest, and violate even your veracity to kill the object of your love?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good heav'n, what shall I do?</P>

<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, now he kneels, 'tis all over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Colonel, Madam, has great sensibility, and the consciousness that he himself has been the cause of your unhappiness will sill him with endless regret: — Whereas, by escaping with me, the case will be utterly otherwise. — When he sees we are inseparably united, and hears with how unabating an assiduity I labour to merit the blessing of your hand, a little time will necessarily make us friends; and I have great hopes that before the end of three months we shall be the favourites of the whole family.</P>

<SPEAKER>Miss RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I am strangely apprehensive, — but I'll be there. — However, 'tis now high time for us to separate, — my father's eyes are generally every where — and I am impatient since it is determin∣ed — till our design is executed.</P>

<P>You do what you will with me!

<PB N="42" REF="48"/>will think it strange that I shou'd not promote his felicity, because he has utterly destroyed mine; and my dutiful daughter will be surprized if the tender ties of nature are not strictly regarded in my conduct, though she has violated the most sacred of them all in her own. — Death and hell! who wou'd be a father? — There is yet one way left, — and, if that fails, — why, I never had a daughter. —</P>

<P>Nay, now Sir I must tax you with unkind∣ness, — know something that may possibly be of consequence to my welfare, — and yet decline to tell me! — Is this consistent with the usual friend∣ship which I have met with from Mr. Cecil?</P>

<P>Where is the need of Sirring me at every word? — I desire you will lay aside this ceremony, and

<P>No?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss MARCHMONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, Sir! I had but two friends in the world, — yourself and Lady Betty, — and I am, with justice apprehensive that neither will consider me long with any degree of regard, — Lady Betty has a proposal from Lord Winworth of the same nature with yours, in which I fear she will strongly in∣terest herself, — and I must be under the painful necessity of disobliging you both, from an utter impossibility of listening to either of your recom∣mendations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CECIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you, Hortensia, not to alarm yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss MARCHMONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Sir, I have always considered you with reverence, and it would make me inconceivably wretched if you imagin'd I was actuated upon this occasion by any ridiculous singularity of senti∣ment. — I wou'd do much to please you, — and I scarcely know what I should refuse to Lady Betty's
<PB N="46" REF="52"/>request; — but, Sir, though it distresses me ex∣ceedingly to discover it, — I must tell you I have not a heart to dispose of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CECIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>How's this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss MARCHMONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>At the same time, I must however, tell you, that my affections are so plac'd as to make it wholly impossible for me ever to change my situation. — This acknowledgment of a prepossession, Sir, may be inconsistent with the nice reserve which is proper for my sex, — but it is necessary to justify me in a case where my gratitude might be reasonably sus∣pected, and when I recollect to whom it is made, I hope it will be doubly entitled to an excuse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CECIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your candour, Hortensia, needs no apology, — but as you have trusted me thus far with your secret, — may'nt I know why you can have no prospect of being united to the object of your affections?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss MARCHMONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because, Sir, he is engaged to a most deserv∣ing young lady, and will be married to her in a few days: — In short, Mr. Sidney is the Man for whom I entertain this secret partiality: — You see, therefore, that my partiality is hopeless, — but you see, at the same time, how utterly im∣proper it would be for me to give a lifeless hand to another while he is entirely master of my af∣fections. — It would be a meanness of which I think myself incapable, and I should be quite un∣worthy the honour of any deserving hand, if, cir∣cumstanc'd in this manner, I could basely stoop to accept it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="47" REF="53"/>
<SPEAKER>CECIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>You interest me strangely in your story, Hor∣tensia: — But has Sidney any idea? —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss MARCHMONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>None in the least. — Before the match with Miss Rivers was in agitation he made addresses to me, though privately; and, I must own, his ten∣derness, join'd to his good qualities, soon gave me impressions in his favour. — But, Sir, I was a poor orphan, wholly dependant upon the generosity of others, and he was a younger brother of a fa∣mily, great in his birth, but contracted in his circumstances. — What cou'd I do? — It was not in my power to make his fortune, — and I had too much pride, or too much affection, to think of destroying it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CECIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are a good girl, — a very good girl; — but surely if Lady Betty knows any thing of this matter there can be no danger of her recommend∣ing Lord Winworth so earnestly to your atten∣tion. —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss MARCHMONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>There, Sir, is my principle misfortune. — Lady Betty is, of all persons, the least proper to be made acquainted with it. — Her heart is in the marriage between Miss Rivers and Mr. Sidney; and, had she the least idea of my senti∣timents for him, or of his inclination for me, I am positive it would immediately frustrate the match. — On this account, Sir, I have carefully con∣cealed the secret of my wishes, — and, on this account, I must still continue to conceal it. — My heart shall break before it shall be worthless;
<PB N="48" REF="54"/>— and I should detest myself for ever if I was ca∣pable of establishing my own peace at the expence of my benefactress's first wish, and the desire of her whole family.</P>

<P>My life was mark'd out early by calamity, — and the first light I beheld was purchas'd with the loss of a mother. — The grave snatched away the best of fathers just as I came to know the value of such a blessing; — and had'nt it been for the exalted goodness of others, I, who once expe∣rienc'd the unspeakable pleasure of relieving the necessitous, had myself, perhaps, felt the imme∣diate want of bread; — and shall I ungratefully sting the bosom which has thus benevolently cherished me? — Shall I basely wound the peace of those who have rescu'd me from despair, — and stab at their tranquility in the very moment they honour me with protection? — O, Mr. Cecil! they deserve every sacrifice which I can make. — May the benignant hand of Providence shower endless happiness upon their heads, and may the sweets of a still-encreasing felicity be their portion, whatever becomes of me!</P>

<P>Hortensia, — I can't stay with you. — My eyes are exceedingly painful of late; — what the devil can be the matter with them? — But, let me tell you before I go, that you shall be happy after all; — that you shall, I promise you; — but I see Lady Betty coming this way — and I cannot en∣ter into explanations, — yet, do you hear, —
<PB N="49" REF="55"/>don't suppose I am angry with you for refusing my friend, — don't suppose such a thing, I charge you; — for he has too much pride to force him∣self upon any woman, and too much humanity to make any woman miserable. — He is besides a very foolish fellow, and it does'nt signify —</P>

<P>Well, my dear Hortensia, I am come again to ask you what you think of Lord Winworth. — We were interrupted before, — and I want, as soon as possible, for the reason I hinted, to know your real opinion of him.</P>

</SP>

<SPEAKER>Miss MARCHMONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do, my dear Lady Betty,—I can honour, I can reverence him, — but I cannot feel that tenderness for his person which I imagine to be necessary both for his happiness and my own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word, my dear, you are extremely difficult in your choice, and if Lord Winworth is not capable of inspiring you with tenderness — I don't know who is likely to succeed; for, in my opinion, there is not a man in England posses∣sed of more personal accomplishments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss MARCHMONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, great as these accomplishments are, my dear Lady Betty, they never excited your ten∣ness. —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, all this is very true, my dear, — but, though I felt no tenderness, — yet I — to be sure, I — that is — I say, nevertheless. — This is be∣yond my hopes.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my dear, I see your emotion — and I heartily beg your pardon for saying so much. — I should be inexpressibly concern'd if I thought you made any sacrifice on this occasion to me. — My Lord, to be sure, possesses a very high place in my esteem, — but —</P>

<SPEAKER>Miss MARCHMONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Lady Betty, what can I do? — I see you are offended with me, — and yet —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I offended with you, my dear! — far from it; I commend your resolution extremely, since my Lord is not a man to your taste. — Offended with you! why should I take the liberty to be offended with you? — A presumption of that nature —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss MARCHMONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Lady Betty, this affair makes me very unhappy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, my dear, you talk very strangely; — so far from being sorry that you have refus'd my Lord — I am pleas'd, — infinitely pleas'd, — that is, since he was not agreeable to you. — Be satisfied your acceptance of him would have given me no pleasure in the world, — I assure you it wou'd'nt, — on the contrary, as matters are situated, I wou'd'nt for the world have you give him the smallest encouragement.</P>

<P>I see she's greatly disappointed at my refusal of an offer so highly to my advantage, — I see, moreover, she's griev'd that his Lordship should
<PB N="53" REF="59"/>meet with a second repulse, and from a quarter too, where the generosity of his proposal might be reasonably expected to promise it success. — How surpriz'd she seem'd when I told her he cou'd'nt make an impression on my heart, and how eagerly she endeavour'd to convince me that she was pleas'd with my conduct; not considering that this very eagerness was a manifest proof of her dissatisfaction. — She is more interested in this affair than I even thought she would be, — and I should be completely miserable if she cou'd suspect me of ingratitude. — As she was so zealous for the match I was certainly to blame in declining it — 'Tis not yet, however, too late. — She has been a thousand parents to me, — and I will not regard my own wishes, when they are any way opposite to her inclinations. — Poor Mr. Cecil! — Make me happy after all! — How? — Impossible! — for I was born to nothing but misfortune. —</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>THUS far, my dear Emmy, there is a gleam of hope. — She determined, posi∣tively determined, against my Lord: — And even suspected so little of my partiality for him, that she appeared under the greatest anxiety lest I should be offended with her refusing him: — And yet, shall I own my folly to you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray do, my dear; — you'll scarcely believe it, — but I have follies of my own sometimes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you quite surprize me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis very true for all that. — But to your business.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, greatly as I dreaded her appro∣bation of the proposal, — I was secretly hurt at her insensibility to the personal attractions of his Lordship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't doubt, it my dear. — We think all the world should love what we are in love with ourselves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="55" REF="61"/>
<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your are right. — And though I was happy to find her resolution so agreeable to my wishes, my pride was not a little piqu'd to find it possible for her to refuse a man upon whom I had so ardently plac'd my own affection. — The surprize which I felt on this account threw a warmth into my expressions, and made the generous girl appre∣hensive that I was offended with her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, this is a strange world we live in. — That a woman without a shilling shou'd refuse an Earl with a fine person, and a great estate is the most surprizing affair I ever heard of. — Perhaps, Lady Betty, my Lord may take it in his head to go round the family: — If he should, my turn is next, and I assure you, he shall meet with a very different reception.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you wou'd'nt be cruel, Emmy!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why no! — Not very cruel. — I might give myself a few airs at first. — I might blush a little, and look down. — Wonder what he cou'd find in me to attract his attention: — Then pulling up my head, with a toss of disdain, — desire him, if ever he spoke to me on that subject again, —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>To have a licence in his pocket, — that's all. — I would make sure work of it at once, and leave it to your elevated minds to deal in delicate absur∣dities. — But I have a little anecdote for you,
<PB N="56" REF="62"/>which proves beyond a doubt that you are as much as ever in possession of Lord Winworth's affection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is it, my dear Emmy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why about an hour ago, my woman, it seems, and Arnold, my Lord's man, had a little con∣versation on this unexpected proposal to Miss Marchmont; in which Arnold said, — <Q>Never tell me of your Miss Marchmonts, Mrs. Nelson; — between ourselves — but let it go no farther — Lady Betty is still the woman, and a sweet crea∣ture she is, that's the truth on't, but a little fantastical, and doesn't know her own mind —</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll assure you! — Why Mr. Arnold is a wit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but hear him out: — <Q>Mrs. Nelson, I know as much of my Lord's mind as any body; let him mary whom he pleases, he'll never be rightly happy but with her Ladyship; and I'd give a hundred guineas, with all my soul, that it cou'd be a match.</Q> — These Nel∣son tells me were his very words. — Arnold is an intelligent fellow, and much in the confidence of his master.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed I always thought my Lord happy in so excellent a servant. — This intelligence is worth a world, my dear Emmy —</P>

<P>How cou'd you ever imagine, my dear Horten∣sia, that your rejection of Lord Winworth cou'd possibly give me the smallest offence? — I have a great regard for his Lordship 'tis true, but I have a great regard for you also; and wou'd by no means wish to see his happiness promoted at your ex∣pence; — think of him therefore no more, and be assur'd you oblige me in an infinitely higher degree by refusing than accepting him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss MARCHMONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>The more I see your Ladyship's tenderness and delicacy, the more I see it necessary to give an affirmative to Lord Winworth's proposal. — Your generosity must not get the better of my gratitude.</P>

<P>O, Sally, you can't conceive my distress in this critical situation. — An elopement even from a tyrannical father, has something in it which must shock a delicate mind. — But when a woman flies from the protection of a parent, who merits the utmost return of her affection, she must be insen∣sible indeed, if she does not feel the sincerest re∣gret: — If he shoud'nt forgive me! —</P>

Have I ever, with the obstinacy of other fathers, been partial in favour of any man to whom you made the slightest objection. — Or have I ever shewn
<PB N="65" REF="71"/>the least design of forcing your wishes to my own humour or caprice? On the contrary has'nt the engagement I have enter'd into been carried on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> seemingly with your own approbation. — And hav'n't you always appeared reconciled at least to a marriage with Mr. Sidney?</P>

<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>How then, Theodora, have I merited a treat∣ment of this nature? You have understanding, my dear, though you want filial affection, and my arguments must have weight with your reason, however my tranquility may be the object of your contempt.—I lov'd you, Theodora, with the warm∣est degree of paternal tenderness, and flatter'd myself the proofs I every day gave of that tender∣ness, had made my peace of mind a matter of some importance to my child. — But, alas! a pal∣try compliment from a coxcomb undoes the whole labour of my life; and the daughter whom I looked upon as the support of my declining years, betrays me in the unsuspecting hour of security, and rewards with her person, the assassin who stabs me to the heart. —</P>

<SPEAKER>Miss RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hear me dear Sir, hear me —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not come here, Theodora, to stop your flight, or put the smallest impediment in the way of your wishes. — Your person is your own, and I scorn to detain even my daughter by force, where she is not bound to me by inclination. — Since therefore neither duty nor discretion, a regard for my peace, nor a solicitude for your own wel∣fare,
<PB N="66" REF="72"/>are able to detain you, — go to this man, who has taught you to obliterate the sentiments of nature, and gain'd a ready way to your heart, by expressing a contempt for your father. — Go to him boldly, my child, and laugh at the pangs which tear this unhappy bosom. — Be uniform∣ly culpable, nor add the baseness of a despica∣ble slight to the unpardonable want of a filial affection.</P>

<P>One thing more, Theodora, — and then fare∣well for ever. — Though you come here to throw off the affection of a child, I will not quit this place, before I discharge the duty of a parent, even to a romantic extravagance, and provide for your welfare, while you plunge me into the most poignant of all distress. — In the doating hours of paternal blandishment, I have often promised you a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, when∣ever you chang'd your situation. — This promise was indeed made when I thought you incapable either of ingratitude, or dissimulation, — and when I fancied your person wou'd be given, where there was some reasonable prospect of your hap∣piness. — But still it was a promise, and shall be faithfully discharged. — Here then in this pocket∣book are notes for that sum.
<STAGE>[Miss RIVERS <HI>shews an unwillingness to receive the pocket-book.</HI>]</STAGE> — Take it — but never see me more. — Banish my name eter∣nally from your remembrance;—and when a little time shall remove me from a world, which your conduct has rendered insupportable, boast an additional title, my dear, to your husband's re∣gard, by having shorten'd the life of your mi∣serable father. —</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIDNEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I AM deeply sensible of Miss Rivers's very great merit, Sir; — but —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what, Sir, —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIDNEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hear me with temper, I beseech you, Colonel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hear you with temper: — I don't know whe∣ther I shall be able to hear you with temper; — but go on, Sir. —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIDNEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Miss Rivers, independent of her very affluent fortune, Colonel, has beauty and merit which would make her alliance a very great honour to the first family in the kingdom — But, notwith∣standing my admiration of her beauty, and my reverence for her merit, I find it utterly impossible to prosit either by her goodness, or your generosity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>How is all this, Sir! do you decline a mar∣riage with my daughter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIDNEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>A marriage with Miss Rivers, Sir, was once the object of my highest ambition, and, had I been honoured with her hand, I should have studied to shew my sensibility of a blessing so invaluble; — but, at that time, I did not sup∣pose
<PB N="73" REF="79"/>my happiness to be incompatible with her's. — I am now convinced that is so, and it becomes me much better to give up my own hopes, than to offer the smallest violence to her inclinations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Death and hell, Sir! — what do you mean by this behaviour? — Shall I prefer your alliance to any man's in England? — Shall my daughter even express a readiness to marry you? — and shall you, after this, insolently tell me you don't choose to accept her? —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIDNEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Colonel, you totally misconceive my mo∣tive, — and, I am sure, upon reflexion, you will rather approve than condemn it — A man of common humanity, Sir, in a treaty of marriage, should consult the lady's wishes as well as his own, and, if he can't make her happy, he will scorn to make her miserable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Scorn to make her miserable! — why the fel∣low's mad, I believe — Does'nt the girl absolute∣ly consent to have you? — Would you have her drag you to the altar by force? — Would you have her fall at your feet, and beg of you, with tears, to pity one of the finest women, with one of the best fortunes, in England?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIDNEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your vehemence, Sir, prevents you from con∣sidering this matter in a proper light. — Miss Rivers is sufficiently unhappy in losing the man of her heart, but her distress must be greatly ag∣gravated, if, in the moment she is most keenly sensible of this loss, she is compelled to marry an∣other. — Besides, Colonel, I must have my seel∣ings
<PB N="74" REF="80"/>too. — There is something shocking in a union with a woman whose affections we know to be alienated; and 'tis difficult to say which is most entitled to contempt, he that stoops to accept of a pre-engaged mind, or he that puts up with a prostituted person.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mighty well, Sir, — mighty well; but let me tell you, Mr. Sidney, — that under this specious appearance of generosity I can easily see your your motive for this refusal of my daughter, — let me tell you I can easily see your motive, Sir, — and, let me tell you, that the person who is in possession of your affections shall no longer find an asylum in this house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIDNEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Colonel, if I had not been always accustomed to respect you, — and if I did not even consi∣der this insult as a kind of compliment, I don't know how I should put up with it: as to your insinuation, you must be more explicit before I can understand you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Miss Marchmont, — Sir. — Do you understand me now, Sir? If Miss Marchmont had not been in the case my daughter had not received this in∣sult. — Sir Harry was right; and had not I been ridiculously besotted with your hypocritical plau∣sibility I might have seen it sooner, but your cou∣sin shall know of your behaviour, and then, Sir, you shall answer me as a man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIDNEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Miss Marchmont, Colonel, is greatly above this illiberal reflexion; as for myself, I shall be always ready to justify an action which I know to
<PB N="75" REF="81"/>be right, though I should be sorry ever to meet you but in the character of a friend.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why really I think he does — but how secret∣ly my Lady Sentimental carried matters — O I always said that your grave, reflecting, moralizing damsels — were a thousand times more suscept∣ible of tender impressions than those lively open hearted girls who talk away at random, and seem ready to run off with every man that happens to fall into their company.</P>

<P>What a ridiculous bustle is there here about de∣licacy and stuff—your people of refin'd sentiments are the most troublesome creatures in the world to deal with, and their friends must even commit a violence upon their nicety before they can con∣descend to study their own happiness: — But have you done as we concerted?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I have pretended to Lady Betty that my Lord desires to speak with her privately on busi∣ness of the utmost importance; and I have told his Lordship that she wants to see him, to disclose a secret that must intirely break off the intended marriage with Miss Marchmont.</P>
</SP>

<P>I did not think that Mrs. Harley could be ca∣pable of such an action; — but since she has told you of the only circumstance which I ever wish'd to be conceal'd, I cannot deny my partiality for your Lordship.</P>

<P>This secret was trusted with her, and her alone; but though she has ungenerously discover'd it, her end will still be disappointed.

<P>No. — And happy as this discovery would have made me at any other time, it now distresses me be∣yond expression, since the engagements I have just enter'd into with Miss Marchmont put it wholly out of my power to receive any benefit from the knowledge of your sentiments. — O, Lady Betty, had you been generously candid when I solicited the blessing of your hand, how much had I been indebted to your goodness; but now, think what my situation is, when, in the moment I am sensible of your regard, I must give you up for ever.</P>

<P>The secret which you have disclos'd, my dear,—</P>

<STAGE>[courtseying.]</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CECIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg, my Lord, that we may'nt interrupt your heroics, <Q>when, in the moment you are sensible
<PB N="81" REF="87"/>of her regard, — you must give her up for ever.</Q> — A very moving speech, Mrs. Harley, —I am sure it almost makes me cry to repeat it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WINWORTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Cecil, listening is —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>What are we going to have a quarrel? —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CECIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, yes! your lover is a mere nobody without a little bloodshed, two or three duels give a won∣derful addition to his character.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what is the meaning of all this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CECIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall know in a moment, Madam, — so walk in, good people, — walk in, and see the most surprising pair of true lovers, who have too much sense to be wise, and too much delicacy to be happy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Walk in, — walk in.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> RIVERS, Miss RIVERS, Miss MARCH∣MONT, Sir HARRY, <HI>and</HI> SIDNEY.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, Emmy! is this behaving like a friend?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and like a true friend, as you shall see presently. —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, I give you joy, joy heartily. — We have been posted for some time under the direc∣tion of Marshal Cecil, and General Harley, in the next room, who have acquainted us with every
<PB N="82" REF="88"/>thing; and I feel the sincerest satisfaction to think the perplexities of to-day have so fortunate a con∣clusion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WINWORTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>The perplexities of to-day are not yet con∣cluded, Colonel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss MARCHMONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, Lady Betty, why wou'dn't you trust me with your secret? I have been the innocent cause of great uneasiness to you, and yet my conduct en∣tirely proceeded from the greatness of my affection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know it, my dear, — I know it well; — but were you to give up Lord Winworth this mo∣ment — be assured that I wou'dn't accept of any sacrifice made at the expence of your happiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CECIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>At the Expence of her happiness! — O, is that all? — Come here master Sobersides [<HI>to</HI> Sidney] and come here, Madam Gravity [<HI>to</HI> Miss March∣mont] come here, I say, — I suppose, my Lord, I suppose, Lady Betty, that you already know from what very manly motives—Sidney, here, has declined the marriage with Miss Rivers?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WINWORTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do, and though I lament the impossibility of a relation to the Colonel's family, I cannot but ad∣mire his behaviour on that occasion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I think it extremely generous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, Cecil, stand by a little, you shan't have the whole management of this discovery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CECIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you ever see such a woman!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="83" REF="89"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my Lord and Lady Betty, since we have agreed thus far, you must know that Mr. Sidney's behaviour has produced more good consequences than you can imagine. — In the first place it has enabled Colonel Rivers, without a breach of his word, —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CECIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>To give his daughter to my foolish kinsman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>You wont hold your tongue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CECIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, in the next place, it has enabled Mr. Sidney —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>To marry Miss Marchmont.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CECIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, she will have the last word. — For it seems that between these two turtles there has long sub∣sisted —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very tender affection, —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CECIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>The devil's in her tongue, — she has the speed of me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WINWORTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>What an unexpected felicity?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am all amazement!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, my dear sister,—no wondering about it, — at a more convenient time you shall know particulars; for the present let me tell you, that now I am cool, and that matters have been pro∣perly
<PB N="84" REF="90"/>explain'd to me, I am not only satisfied but charm'd with Mr. Sidney's behaviour, though it has prevented the first wish of my heart; and I hope that his Lordship and you, by consent∣ing to his marriage with Miss Marchmont, will im∣mediately remove every impediment in the way of your own happiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WINWORTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>If my own happiness was not to be promoted by such a step, I should instantly give my consent; — and therefore, my dear Miss Marchmont, if I have Lady Betty's approbation, and your own con∣currence, I here bestow this hand upon as deserv∣ing a young man as any in the universe. — This is the only attonement I can make for the uneasi∣ness I have given you, and if your happiness is any way proportion'd to your merit, I need not wish you a greater share of felicity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIDNEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>What shall I say, my Lord?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WINWORTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say nothing, Charles, for if you only knew how exquisite a satisfaction I receive on this occasion, you would rather envy my feelings than think yourself under an obligation; — and now, my dear Lady Betty, if I might presume —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I may not be censur'd any longer, I here declare my hand your Lordship's whenever you think proper to demand it; for I am now con∣vinc'd the greatest proof which a woman can give of her own worth, is to entertain an affection for a man of honour and understanding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WINWORTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>This goodness, Madam, is too great for ac∣knowledgment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="85" REF="91"/>
<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And now, my dear Theodora, let me con∣gratulate with you: I rejoice that your inclinations are consulted in the most important circumstance of your life, and I am sure Sir Harry will not be wanting in gratitude for the partiality which you have shewn in his favour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Madam, you oblige me infinitely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And as for me, Lady Betty, it is so much my inclination to deserve the partiality with which Miss Rivers has honour'd me, as well as to repay the goodness of her family, that I shall have little merit in my gratitude to either; I have been wild, I have been inconsiderate, but I hope I never was despicable; and I flatter myself I shan't be wanting in acknowledgment only to those, who have laid me under the greatest of all obligations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Harry, say no more: — My girl's repen∣tance has been so noble, your Cousin Cecil's be∣haviour has been so generous, and I believe you, after all, to be a man of such principle; — that next to Sidney I don't know who I shou'd prefer to you for a son-in-law. — But you must think a little for the future, and remember that it is a poor excuse for playing the fool, to be possessed of a good understanding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WINWORTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, there seems but one thing remaining undone: — I just now took the liberty of exer∣cising a father's right over Miss Marchmont, by disposing of her hand, 'tis now necessary for me—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="86" REF="92"/>
<SPEAKER>CECIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, my Lord — I guess what you are about, but you shan't monopolize generosity I assure you: — I have a right to shew my friendship as well as your Lordship; so, after your kinsman's marriage, whatever you have a mind to do for him shall be equalled, on my part, for Miss Marchmont; guinea for guinea, as far as you will, and let's see who tires first in going through with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WINWORTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>A noble challange, and I accept it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, there's no bearing this —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss MARCHMONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Speak to them, Mr. Sidney, for I cannot —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIDNEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish I had words to declare my sense of this goodness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did'nt look upon myself as a very pitiful fellow; but I am strangely sunk in my own opi∣nion since I have been a witness of this transaction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CECIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why what the devil is there in all this to won∣der at? People of fortune often throw away thousands at the hazard table to make themselves miserable, and nobody ever accuses them of ge∣nerosity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WINWORTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Cecil is perfectly right, and he is the best manager of a fortune who is most attentive to the wants of the deserving.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="87" REF="93"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why now all is as it shou'd be — all is as it shou'd be — this is the triumph of good sense over delicacy. — I could cry for downright joy: — I wonder what ails me — this is all my doing!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CECIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, — part of it is mine, — and I think it ex∣tremely happy for your people of refin'd senti∣ments to have friends with a little common under∣standing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sister, I always thought you a woman of sense.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs HARLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, she has been a long time intimate with me you know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CECIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well said, sauce-box.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>If this story was to be represented on the stage the poet would think it his duty to punish me for life, because I was once culpable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WINWORTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>That wou'd be very wrong. The stage shou'd be a school of morality; and the noblest of all lessons is the forgiveness of injuries.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, my Lord. — But the principal moral to be drawn from the transactions of to-day is, that those who generously labour for the happiness of others, will, sooner or later, arrive at happiness themselves.</P>

<STAGE>Spoken by Mrs. DANCER.</STAGE>
<SP>
<L>WHEN with the comic muse a bard hath dealing,</L>
<L>The traffic thrives, when there's a mutual feeling;</L>
<L>Our author boasts, that well be chose his plan,</L>
<L><HI>False Modesty!</HI> — Himself, <HI>an Irishman.</HI></L>
<L>As I'm a woman, somewhat prone to satire,</L>
<L>I'll prove it all a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ull,</HI> what be calls nature;</L>
<L>And you, I'm sure, will join before you go,</L>
<L>To maul <HI>False Modesty,</HI> — from <HI>Dublin</HI> ho!</L>
<L>Where are these <HI>Lady Lambtons</HI> to be found?</L>
<L>Not in these riper times, on English ground.</L>
<L>Among the various flowers, which sweetly blow,</L>
<L>To charm the eyes, at <HI>Almack's</HI> and <HI>Soho,</HI></L>
<L>Pray does that weed, <HI>False Delicacy,</HI> grow?</L>
<L>O, No. —</L>
<L>Among the fair of fashion; common breeding,</L>
<L>Is there one bosom, where <HI>love lies a bleeding?</HI></L>
<L>In <HI>olden</HI> times your grannams unrefin'd,</L>
<L>Ty'd up the tongue, put padlocks on the mind;</L>
<L>O, Ladies, thank your stars, there's nothing now confin'd.</L>
<L>In love you <HI>English</HI> Men, — there's no concealing,</L>
<L>Are most, like <HI>Winworth,</HI> simple in your dealing;</L>
<L>But <HI>Britons,</HI> in their natures, as their names,</L>
<L>Are different as the <HI>Shanon, Tweed,</HI> and <HI>Thames.</HI></L>
<L>As the <HI>Tweed</HI> flows, the bonny <HI>Scot</HI> proceeds,</L>
<L>Wunds slaw, and sure, and nae obstruction heeds;</L>
<L>Though oft repuls'd, his purpose still hauds fast,</L>
<L>Stecks like a burr, and wuns the Lass at last.</L>
<L>The <HI>Shannon,</HI> rough and vigorous, pours along,</L>
<L>Like the bold accents of brave <HI>Paddy's</HI> tongue:</L>
<L>Arrah, dear creature — can you scorn me so?</L>
<L>Cast your sweet eyes upon me, top and toe!</L>
<L>Not fancy <HI>me?</HI> — Pooh! — that's all game and laughter,</L>
<L>First marry me, my jew'l — ho! — you'll love me after.</L>
<L>Like his own <HI>Thames,</HI> honest <HI>John Trot,</HI> their brother,</L>
<L>More quick than <HI>one,</HI> and much less bold than t'other,</L>
<L><HI>Gentle not dull,</HI> his loving arms will spread;</L>
<L>But stopt — in willows hides his bashful head;</L>
<L><HI>John</HI> leaves his home, resolv'd to tell his pain;</L>
<L>Hesitates — I — love — <HI>fye, Sir — 'tis in vain,</HI> —</L>
<L><HI>John</HI> blushes, turns him round, and whistles home again.</L>
<L>Well! is my painting like? — Or do you doubt it? —</L>
<L>What say you to a trial? — l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t's about it.</L>
<L>Let Cupid lead <HI>three Britons</HI> to the field,</L>
<L>And try which first can make a damsel yield;</L>
<L>What say you to a <HI>widow?</HI> — Smile consent,</L>
<L>And she'll be ready for experiment.</L>
