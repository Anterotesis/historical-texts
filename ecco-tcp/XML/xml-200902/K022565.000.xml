<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>TO be studious of bringing Merit in Obscurity to Light, is so strong an Instance of Benevolence, that it has in all Ages been constantly attended with the highest Commendations; while the Destroyer of a Man's Reputation (in whatsoever it consisted) has been ac∣counted a more odious Criminal than even the Assassin of his Body. On this Remark is founded one of the most beau∣tiful Passages in <HI>SHAKESPEARE:</HI></P>
<Q><LG>
<L><HI>Who steals my Purse, steals Trash;</HI></L>
<L><HI>'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been Slave to Thousands:</HI></L>
<L><HI>But he that filches from me my good Name,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Steals from me that which not enriches him,</HI></L>
<L><HI>But makes me poor indeed.</HI></L>
</LG>
<BIBL><HI>OTHELLO.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="4"/>
This is so true an Observation, that few, I believe, will doubt, that <HI>MILTON</HI> was less offended at the low Price his inestimable Poem was rated at on its first Publication, than he would have been at the late mean Attempts to subvert a Fame so well established.</P>
<P>To view the Character of this <HI>SON OF DARKNESS</HI> in its most genuine Form, let us contrast it with another no less eminent for its Splendor, which is the properest I could chuse for my present Purpose, as it is particularly so in relation to that <HI>DIVINE AUTHOR</HI> we have lately seen so well vindicat∣ed from the groundless Aspersions of almost his only Enemy.</P>
<P>In the Course of the <HI>Spectators,</HI> Mr. <HI>ADDISON</HI> (who was perhaps the most candid Critick that ever wrote, without de∣viating from Impartiality) took a particular Pleasure in producing latent unregarded Worth, that he might show those Cavillers who were daily complaining of a Deartb of good Poetry, what noble things of this Kind they neglected.</P>
<P>Agreeably to this End is his Criticism on the <HI>old English Ballad of Chevy-Chace;</HI> but his most glorious Works of this Kind are his Observations on the <HI>PARADISE LOST.</HI> There is not a stronger Instance of Prejudice, and the Force of Party, than the Reception this Poem met with in the Au∣thor's Life-time, whose unhappy Attachment to wrong
<PB N="vii" REF="5"/>
Principles, render'd all his Attempts at Fame (while liv∣ing) fruitless. His admirable Poem lay in Obscurity till Mr. <HI>ADDISON</HI> removed those envious Clouds which had been suffered to obstruct its Splendor. With what Plea∣sure does be discover its Excellencies, and instruct an or∣dinary Reader to judge of its Beauties! With what Regret does he speak of the sew Blemishes of that Divine Piece, which (says he) <HI>is like writing a Treatise upon the Spots of the Sun.</HI></P>
<P>These Remarks are so universally read and approved, that, I believe every body but <HI>LAUDER</HI> (and his Friends, if he has any) will concur with me in the following Observa∣tion: Had Mr. <HI>ADDISON</HI> never wrote a Line but his Cri∣tique upon <HI>MILTON,</HI> that would alone have been sufficient to have established his Reputation as a fine Writer and a good Man.</P>
<P>If the Reader would view the exact Reverse of the above Character, let him turn his Eyes on <HI>LAUDER:</HI> A Being so utterly void of Candour and Benevolence, that he has thought it worth his While to commit the grossest Forgeries, to di∣sturb, if possible, the Ashes of our Poet, and has been more industrious to depreciate the <HI>Paradise Lost</HI> than the Writers in the Beginning of this Century were to heap Encomiums upon it. The Inhumanity and amazing Impudence of these Proceedings have puzzled all, to devise a likely Reason for so
<PB N="viii" REF="6"/>
strange a Piece of Malice. The faint Excuses alledged for this Behaviour in <HI>LAUDER'S Recantation,</HI> by no Means pal∣liate his Crime, notwithstanding the florid Dress he has cloathed them in. Though I am far from being admitted into his secret Counsels, I believe I may venture to mention one, which, out of his usual Regard to Truth, he has pur∣posely omitted. It is very possible the same thing which has often made Poets, tempted <HI>LAUDER</HI> to unmake one, <HI>viz.</HI> Poverty and the Hopes of a Subscription.</P>
<P>These potent Arguments once induced him to commend with some Warmth the very same Poem he has lately been at so much Pains to brand, as a Work of no Genius: But as Honesty would no longer procure him a Dinner, his Con∣science did not prevent him from turning the Tables.</P>
<Q><HI>Rem faciam Rem, Si possim, rectè, si non, quocunque modo Rem.</HI></Q>
<P>But we will urge this no farther, remembering, that it is not right to speak Ill of the <HI>Dead.</HI></P>
<P><HI>PREFACES</HI> are commonly intended for Discourses to the Reader on the Book he is entering upon; but the Considera∣tion of a Being quite divested of Modesty and Humanity, na∣turally led me into the foregoing Reflections, arising from the Subject of these Sheets.</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="7"/>
I shall not trouble the Reader with an Account of the Time I was employed in writing it, or insipidly petition the Favour of the Criticks, but commit it to the World, 
<Q>With all its Imperfections on its Head.</Q></P>
<P>An Attempt to overthrow the bold Assertions of <HI>LAUDER</HI> by Poetry, till he had been foiled at his own Weapons, would hardly have succeeded. But when so invincible a Champion as Mr. <HI>DOUGLAS</HI> had taken the Field, and returned victo∣rious, the <HI>MUSES,</HI> who were particularly interested in the Contest, should adorn him with the Insignia of a Triumph.</P>
<P>This Hint has already given Rise to the <HI>Pandaemonium</HI> and the following Stanzas, in Imitation of <HI>SPENSER.</HI> The Design of our several Pieces are so very different, that it is almost impossible they should clash in point of Merit. If we both meet with Success, according to our various Models, we need not be disheartened at any accidental Rivalship or absurd Comparison an injudicious Reader may draw be∣tween us.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>DRYDEN,</HI> in some Part of his Works, has an Ob∣servation hinting at <HI>Poetical Genealogy. We have amongst us</HI> (says he) <HI>our Lines and Descents, in as regular a man∣ner as the noblest Families.</HI> In deducing the best <HI>English</HI> Writers from their poetick Original, he observes, that <HI>MIL∣TON</HI>
<PB N="x" REF="8"/>
is the first Descendant from <HI>SPENSER.</HI> This Remark of so great a Judge as Mr. <HI>DRYDEN</HI> induced me to chuse <HI>SPENSER</HI> for my Model, and to place him by the Side of <HI>APOLLO</HI> in my <HI>Poem,</HI> imagining there was a peculiar Pro∣priety in shielding the Son under the Protection of the Fa∣ther.</P>
<P>As I did not suppose that Imitations were bound to tran∣scribe the Faults as well as Excellencies of their Original, I made no Scruple of making a slight Alteration in <HI>SPENSER'S Stanza,</HI> which is universally condemned for the Redun∣dancy of its correspondent Rhimes. The Difficulty I should have found in the Execution had perhaps some Share in this voluntary Omission. Allowing this to be certain, my judi∣cious Reader will be so far from thinking it a Blemish, that I am persuaded he will readily compound for the Loss of some of my Bells, provided I can entertain him more ra∣tionally. I have, in general, rather wished to fall into <HI>SPENSER</HI>'S Way of Thinking than his Manner of cloathing his Sentiments, because I think his Imagery infinitely supe∣rior to his Stile. I have, however, be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n so far from ne∣glecting his Language, that except those Places where I found the old Words express less than the modern, I always gave them the Preference. Whether I have transfused any of the divine Spirit of <HI>SPENSER</HI> into the following Stanzas, and whether his Style is successfully imitated, the Reader must judge for himself.</P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="9"/>
The Mention I made of the slight Variation from <HI>SPEN∣SER</HI>'S Stanza, was meerly to prevent the Nibblers of the Age from imputing it to Ignorance. These would-be Cri∣ticks take great Pains to pervert the Movements of the hu∣man Mind, which certainly has more Pleasure in bestowing Commendations than Dispraise. I beg Leave to show the Truth of this Assertion by an Instance drawn from myself as an Author. Whatever Satisfaction it may have afforded me to stigmatize the Malice of <HI>LAUDER</HI>'S Proceedings, no∣thing in the whole Course of this Work pleased me so much as celebrating Mr. <HI>DOUGLAS.</HI> If the following Trifle should meet with the Approbation of the Publick, I hope that Gentleman will think it an acceptable Present to Himself.</P>

<L>Hither in evil Hour the Monsters came,</L>
<L>And with their new Companion did alight,</L>
<L>Who long had lost all Sense of virtuous Shame,</L>
<L>Beholding worth with poisonous Despight;</L>
<L>On his Success depends their impious Delight.</L>

<L>Long burnt he sore the Summit to obtain,</L>
<L>And spread his Venom o'er the blissful Seat;</L>
<L>Long burnt he sore, but still he burnt in vain;</L>
<L>Mote none come then, who come with impious Feet.</L>
<L>At length, at unawares he out doth spit</L>
<L>That Spite, which else had to himself been Bane;</L>
<L>The Venom on the Breast of <HI>Milton</HI> lit,</L>

<L>The Bard, of Life bereft, fell senseless on the Plain.</L>

<L>Forth issued from their dismal dirk Abodes</L>
<L>The Birds attendant upon hideous Night,</L>

<L>The MUSES sprinkle him with Dew of <HI>Castaly,</HI></L>
<L>And crown his Death with many a living Strain;</L>
<L>Hoary PARNASSUS beats his aged Breast,</L>
<L>Aged, yet ne'er before did Sorrow know;</L>

<L>The stricken Bard fresh vital Heat renews,</L>
<L>Whose Blood, erst stagnate, rushes thro' his Veins;</L>
<L>Life thro' each Pore her Spirit doth infuse,</L>
<L>And FAME, by MALICE inexpulsive, reigns:</L>
<L>And see, a female Form, all heav'nly bright,</L>
<L>Upheld by one of mortal Progeny,</L>
<L>A female Form, yclad in snowy White,</L>
<L>Ne half so fair at Distance seems as nigh;</L>
<L>DOUGLAS and TRUTH appear, ENVY and LAUDER die.</L>
