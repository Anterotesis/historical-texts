<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE><HI>Written by</HI> W. T. FITZGERALD, <HI>Esquire.</HI></BYLINE>
<SP>
<STAGE><HI>Spoken by Mr.</HI> M'CREADY.</STAGE>
<L>THE stage should be, to life, a faithful glass,</L>
<L>Reflecting modes, and manners as they pass;</L>
<L>If these extravagant appear to you,</L>
<L>Blame not the drama,—the reflection's true—</L>
<L>Our Author makes of virtue no parade,</L>
<L>And only ridicules the <HI>vice</HI> of trade;</L>
<L>Exposes Folly in its native tint,</L>
<L>And leaves, mankind to profit by the hint.</L>
<L>The modern buck,—how diff'rent from the beau</L>
<L>In bag and ruffles, sixty years ago!</L>
<L>The city coxcomb then was seldom seen,</L>
<L>(Consin'd to Bunhill-row, or Bethnal-green:)</L>
<L>West of Cheapside you then could scarcely meet</L>
<L>The gay Lothario—of Threadneedle-street!</L>
<L>His folly rarely met the public eye,</L>
<L>Or, like a shadow, pass'd unheeded by:</L>
<L>Tradesman and rake were then remov'd as far</L>
<L>As gay St James's is from Temple-bar.</L>
<L>But now the cit must breathe a purer air,</L>
<L>The 'Change he <HI>visits</HI>—lives in Badford-square—</L>
<L>Insures a fleet—then Bootle's club attends,</L>
<L>Proud to be notic'd by his titled friends;</L>
<L>And tries to join, by Dissipation's aid,</L>
<L>The man of fashion with the man of trade.</L>
<L>Vain to associate with superior rank,</L>
<L>He quits his <HI>ledger</HI>—for the Faro bank;</L>
<L><PB REF="3"/>His dashing curricle down Bond-street drives,</L>
<L>Risking his <HI>own</HI>—and worse—his horses' lives;</L>
<L>Till, urging Fortune's glowing wheel too fast,</L>
<L>This empty air-blown bubble breaks at last!</L>
<L>Tho' trade may give such upstart mushrooms birth,</L>
<L>The Muse pays homage to its real worth.</L>
<L>This isle to commerce owes her splendid state,</L>
<L>The source of all that makes her truly great!</L>
<L>And 'midst her busy sons enough are found</L>
<L>To raise dejected mis'ry from the ground.</L>
<L>While commerce, with a lib'ral heart bestows</L>
<L>Her wealth, to mitigate the poor man's woes;</L>
<L>Seeks out the wretch, his gloomy prison cheers,</L>
<L>And wipes, with pitying hand, the widow's tears—</L>
<L>The applauding world will say (such bounty giv'n)</L>
<L>The English merchant is the steward of heav'n.</L>
<L>Our Author now that candour would implore,</L>
<L>Which your indulgence has bestow'd before;</L>
<L>Still on a gen'rous Public he depends;</L>
<L>Give your support—he asks no better friends!</L>

enters this day upon the tonish office of sheriff of your ancient corporarion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Land.</SPEAKER>
<P>He does.—And what's better, by the sudden death of an old maid, miss Sarah Sapless, he and his daughter will, it is said, enter upon the fingering of about thirty thousand pounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good news, egad!—Well, old Porcupine, get dinner; and, d'ye hear, none of your ropy champagne—the real stuff <STAGE>(slaps him on the back.)</STAGE></P>

<P>Now for it! this makes me a bankrupt, or a good man. <STAGE>(Reads)</STAGE> <Q>Dear Dashall, all's up</Q>—As I thought.—<Q>Transfer swears if you don't settle your bear account in a week, he'll black-board you</Q>—Pleasant enough!—<Q>Affectionate inquiries are making after you at Lloyd's; and, to crown all, Hops were so lively last market, that there is already a lose of thousands upon that scheme—Nothing can save you but the ready.—Yours, TIM. TICK.</Q></P>
<P><Q>N. B. Green peas were yesterday sold at Leaden∣hall-Market at nine-pence a peck; so your bet of three thousand pounds on that event is lost.</Q> So! lurch'd every way—stocks, insurance, hops, hazard,
<PB N="3" REF="7"/>
and green peas, all over the left shoulder; and then, like a flat, I must get pigeon'd at faro by ladies of quality; for the swagger of saying <Q>The duchess and I were curst jolly last night;</Q> but, confusion to de∣spair! I'm no flincher.—If I can but humbug old All∣spice out of a few thousands, and marry his daughter, I shall cut a gay figure, and make a splash yet.</P>

</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> LADY SORREL.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Inform my cousin Caustic, I'm here.— Ah! Dashall, I suppose the warm weather has driven you from town.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dash.</SPEAKER>
<P>True; London was certainly too hot for me; but how could your ladyship leave the fascination of play?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hush! that's not my rural character.—I always assimilate.—The fact is, Dick, I have here a strange, plain-spoken, worthy, and wealthy relation; he gives me considerable sums to distribute in London to the needy, which I lose in play, to people of fashion; and you'll allow that is giving them to the needy, and fulfilling the worthy donor's intention, ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you are not here because your favou∣rite, young Tangent, is arrived? eh!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sor.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, Dick, have you found out my attachment there? Well, I confess it: and if my regard be, not, I'll take care, my revenge shall be, gra∣tified;
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>
and 'tis a great consolation that one is nearly as sweet as the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dash.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I'll be equally can did. The miserable fact is, I am completely brozier'd, cut down to a six∣pence, and have left town.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Like a skilful engineer, who, having laid his train for the destruction of others, prudently retires daring the blow-up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Caust. </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(without)</STAGE>
<P>In the next room, do you say? <STAGE>(Enters)</STAGE> Lady Sorrel, I rejoice to see you, and have provided at home for your reception.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I'll order my carriage and servants there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Caust.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; I can depend on your prudence, but not on your servants'—S'death! were any of your fashionable London servants to get footing in my family, I suppose in a week my old housekeeper would give <HI>conversationes,</HI> a little music, and twopenny faro.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Vastly well.—By no means contemptible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Caust.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Cousin, this is Mr. Dashall, one of the first men in the city,—sees the first company, lives in the first style—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Caust.</SPEAKER>
<P>This a merchant of the city of London?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Curse the quiz! Ill throw off a little—Perhaps you've not been in town lately.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Caust.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, sir,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, the old school quite gone by—I remember, my old gig of a father wore a velvet nightcap in his cornering house—what a vile bore, ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>Caust.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, sir, what may you wear in your compting house?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Strike me moral if I've seen it these three months. If you wish to trade in style, and make a splash, you must fancy Cheapside Newmarket, and Lloyd's and the Alley faro tables, for Demoivre has as completely ousted Cocker's Arithmetic with us, as Hoyle has the Complete Housewife with our wives, egad—talk of Brooks's or Newmarket; chicken hazard to the game we play at Lloyd's—monopoly's the word now, old boy; hops, corn, sugar, surs—at all in the ring.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Caust.</SPEAKER>
<P>Amazing! sir, your capital must be astonishing to be—at all in the ring</P>
<STAGE>(mimicking.)</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Capital! an old bugbear—never thought of now—no, paper—discount does it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Caust.</SPEAKER>
<P>Paper!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye; suppose I owe a tradesman, my taylor for instance, two thousand pounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Caust.</SPEAKER>
<P>A merchant owe his-taylor two thousand pounds! mercy on us!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dash.</SPEAKER>
<P>I give him my note for double the sum, he discounts it—I touch half in the ready—note comes due—double the sum again—touch half again, and so on to the tune of fifty thousand pounds. If monopolies answer, make all frraight—if not, smash—into the Gazette. Brother merchants say "damn'd fine fel∣low—lived in style:—only traded beyond his capital. So, certificate's signed—ruin a hundred or two reptiles of retailers, and so begin the war again.—That's the way to make a splash—devilish neat, isn't it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>Caust.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pretty well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dash.</SPEAKER>
<P>How you stare! you <HI>don't</HI> know <HI>nothing</HI> of life, old boy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Caust.</SPEAKER>
<P>Vulgar scoundrel!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dash.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are the boys in, the city. Why, there's Sweetwort, the brewer,—don't you know Sweetwort? dines an hour later than any duke in the kingdom— imports his own turtle—dresses turbot by a stop∣watch—has house-lamb fed on cream, and pigs on pine-apples—gave a jollification t'other day—Stoke∣hole in the brewhouse—asked a dozen peers—all glad to come—can't live as we do. Who make the splash in Hyde-Park? who fill the pit at the opera who inhabit the squares in the west? why, the knowing ones from the east to be sure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Caust.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not the wife one's from the east, I'm sure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who support the fashionable faro tables? oh, how the ducheffes chuckle and rub their hands, when they see one of us!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Caust.</SPEAKER>
<P>Duchesses keep gaming tables!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dash.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure! how the devil shou'd they live? such a blow-up the other night! you were there, Lady Sorrel!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sor.</SPEAKER>
<P>I at a saro table!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Caust.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dash. </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(aside)</STAGE>
<P>Upon my honour I beg pardon—you see, sir, the duchess was dealing, and Mrs. Swagger was punting. Oh ho! cries Mrs. Swagger, "That was very neatly done"—"What do you mean?" says the duchess—"Only, madam, I saw you slip a card"—"dam'me" says the duchess—</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Says the duke.</P>

<P>No, no! "dam'me," says the duke.</P>

<SPEAKER>Dash</SPEAKER>
<P>Psha! the duchess, I tell you. It's her way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Caust.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her way! O Lud!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where was I? oh, "dam'me," says the duchess, "but you turn out of my house"—"and curle me," cries little miss Swagger, (a sweet ami∣able little creature of about fourteen) "if we stay here to be swindled."—Words got high, and oaths flew about like rouleaus; but as they had plucked me of my last feather, I got up, and, in imitation of my betters, twang'd off a few dam'mes, and retired.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Caust.</SPEAKER>
<P>The world's at an end—all is sophisticated!—nothing bears even its right name—whoredom is gallantry; swindling, running out; female debauchery, a <HI>faux-pas.</HI> The murdering duellist has a nice sense of honour, the cuckold-maker is a dear delicious devil, and the cuckold the best humour'd crea∣ture in the world.</P>

<P>Well said, old one—you've some <HI>nous</HI> about you.</P>

<P>May'nt I trust my eyes?</P>

<P>Why, at fifty-nine, cousin, eyes are not al∣ways to be trusted. Pray, Mr. Dashall, do you know this nephew of mine?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh yes; but he associates with authors and wits, quite out of our set—we in the city don't vote them gentlemen—you'll never find <HI>no</HI> wit at my table, I'll take care of that.—But you expect company, and so I'll be off to my friend Allspice's.—By the way, I hear his daughter will touch to the tune of thirty thousand pounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Caust</SPEAKER>
<P>Very likely: but I don't know any good it will do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er.</P>

<P>Not do good! I beg pardon. Riches gives wit,—elegance.</P>

<P>Do they? I'm sorry you're so poor.</P>

<P>A very unfashionable one; uncle; in paying my debts.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly not—I'll attend you; but first I must go to the courts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, stick to the law—stick to that—stick to any thing.

<P>No, sir. Honour, is the conversation of so∣ciety: without it, even our virtues wou'd be danger∣ous. It tempers courage, and vice it puts to shame; it irradiates truth, and mixes up opposing passions in the sweet compound of urbanity.</P>

<P>It was my fate to marry contrary to my father's will, and I was driven by misfortune to India; where, after a residence of eighteen years, the news reached me of my father's decease, and that at his death he had done me the justice he refused me living. I was about to return to England to take possession of my estates, when the service demanded my assistance to check the inroads of a powerful banditti that infested the fron∣tier.—In a skirmish, Lieutenant Richmond, a brave
<PB N="18" REF="22"/>
lad, fell by my side—he gave to my care one thou∣sand pounds, as a bequest to his friend Mr. Tan∣gent.</P>

I only want to speak to you. Oh, if I cou'd but fasten on him—I want to give you another thousand pounds. I do indeed. Oh, the infer∣nal villain! My excellent friend, don't hide yourself.</P>

<P>I'm satisfied. Well, cousin, I've got you a

<P>Yes, my lady, an honest pretty man.</P>
