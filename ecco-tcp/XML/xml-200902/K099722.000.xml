<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been so hackney'd a practice for Authors to pretend that imperfect copies of their works had crept abroad, that the writer of the following Pastoral is almost ashamed to alledge this as the <HI>real</HI> cause of the present publication. This little poem was composed several years ago (the Author's age eighteen) and recited at that Time, and since, by a party of young Ladies, for which purpose it was originally written; by this means, some mutilated copies were circulated, unknown to the Author, thro' many Hands.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="dedication">
<PB REF="5"/>
<HEAD>TO Mrs. GWATKIN.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS the following little poem turns chiefly on the danger of <HI>delay,</HI> or <HI>error,</HI> in the important article of <HI>Education;</HI> I know not to whom I can, with more propriety, dedicate it, than to you: as the subject it inculcates, has been one of the principal objects of your attention, in your own family. Let not the name of <HI>dedication</HI> alarm you; I am not going to offend by making your eulogium. Panegyric is only necessary to suspicious, or common characters. Virtue will not ac∣cept it. Modesty will not offer it.</P>
<P>The friendship with which you have honor'd me from my very childhood, will, I flatter myself, be exerted in my favour on this occasion, and induce you to pardon
<PB REF="6"/>me for venturning, without your permission, to lay, before you this public testimony of my esteem, and to assure you, how much I am,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>Dear Madam,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>Your obedient, and obliged humble Servant, The AUTHOR.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<SP>
<LG>
<L>WITH trembling diffidence, with modest fear,</L>
<L>Before this gentle audience we appear.</L>
<L>Ladies! survey us with a tender eye,</L>
<L>Put on good-nature, and lay judgment by.</L>
<L>No deep-laid plot adorns our humble page,</L>
<L>But scenes adapted to our sex and age.</L>
<L>No haughty female's passions here describ'd,</L>
<L>Nor chamber-maids by jealous husbands brib'd;</L>
<L>Simplicity is all our author's aim,</L>
<L><HI>She</HI> does not write, nor do <HI>we</HI> speak for <HI>fame.</HI></L>
<L>To make amusement and instruction friends,</L>
<L>A lesson in the guise of play she sends;</L>
<L>She claims no merit but her love of truth,</L>
<L>No plea to favor, but her <HI>sex</HI> and <HI>youth:</HI></L>
<L>With these alone to boast, she sends me here,</L>
<L>To beg your kind, indulgent, partial ear.</L>
<L>Of critic <HI>man</HI> she could not stand the test,</L>
<L>But you with softer, gentler hearts are bless'd:</L>
<L>With <HI>him</HI> she dares not rest her feeble cause,</L>
<L>Too low a mark for satire, or applause.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ladies, protect her—do not be satyric,</L>
<L>Spare censure, she expects not panegyric.</L>

<SPEAKER>FLORISSA.</SPEAKER>
<L>WELCOME, ye humble vales, ye flow'ry shades,</L>
<L>Ye murmuring fountains, and ye verdant glades!</L>
<L>From all the gilded misery of the great,</L>
<L>From all the dull impertinence of state;</L>
<L>From scenes, where daring guilt triumphant reigns,</L>
<L>It's dark suspicions, and it's hoard of pains;</L>
<L>Where pleasure never comes without alloy,</L>
<L>And art wou'd varnish o'er fallacious joy;</L>
<L>Where folly crowns the day, excess the night,</L>
<L>And dull satiety succeeds delight;</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="10"/>
Where midnight vices their fell orgies keep,</L>
<L>And guilty revels scare the phantom sleep;</L>
<L>Where dissipation wears the name of bliss;</L>
<L>From these we fly in search of Happiness.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUPHELIA.</SPEAKER>
<L>And lo, at length, propitious to our view,</L>
<L>Behold the spot our anxious hopes pursue!</L>
<L>These branching oaks, which old as time appear,</L>
<L>Proclaim URANIA'S dwelling to be near.</L>
<L>And see—observe the low-roof'd cottage rise;</L>
<L>Not regal domes so grateful to my eyes.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PASTORELLA.</SPEAKER>
<L>How the description with the scene agrees!</L>
<L>Here lowly thickets, there aspiring trees:</L>
<L>The hazle copse excluding noon-day's beam,</L>
<L>The tufted arbor, the pellucid stream:</L>
<L>The blooming sweet-briar and the hawthorn shade,</L>
<L>The springing cowslips and the daisied mead:</L>
<L>The wild luxuriance of the full-blown fields,</L>
<L>Which spring prepares and laughing Summer yields.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUPHELIA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Here simple nature strikes the raptur'd eye,</L>
<L>With charms which wealth and art but ill supply;</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="11"/>
The genuine graces, which, <HI>without,</HI> we find,</L>
<L>Display the beauty of the owner's mind.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAURINDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yes, be assur'd, this grove contains the cell</L>
<L>Where sage URANIA and her children dwell.</L>
<L>FLORELLA too, if right we've heard the tale,</L>
<L>With them resides—the lily of the vale.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FLORISSA.</SPEAKER>
<L>But soft, what gentle female form appears,</L>
<L>Which, rosy health, and softest beauty wears?</L>
<L>Some Angel, sure, commission'd from above,</L>
<L>Or else the smiling genius of the grove!</L>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> FLORELLA, <HI>who speaks.</HI></STAGE>
<L>What do I see?—ye beauteous virgins, say,</L>
<L>What chance conducts your steps this desart way?</L>
<L>Do you pursue some fav'rite lambkin stray'd,</L>
<L>Or do you alders court you to their shade?</L>
<L>Declare, fair strangers, for, if right I deem,</L>
<L>No rustic nymphs of vulgar rank you seem.</L>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FLORISSA.</SPEAKER>
<L>No cooling shades allure our eager sight,</L>
<L>Nor lambkin lost our searching steps invite.</L>

<PB N="4" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER>FLORELLA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Or is it, haply, yonder branching vine,</L>
<L>Whose trunk the woodbine's fragrant tendrils twine:</L>
<L>Whose spreading height with purple clusters crown'd,</L>
<L>Attracts the gaze of ev'ry nymph around?</L>
<L>Or doth the juicy pear your eyes invite,</L>
<L>Whose rich delicious ripeness tempts the sight?</L>
<L>Say, is it this, or ought I have beside,</L>
<L>FLORELLA'S fruits, her flow'rs, her fleecy pride?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUPHELIA.</SPEAKER>
<L>FLORELLA! our united thanks receive,</L>
<L>Sole proof of gratitude we have to give!</L>
<L>And since you deign to ask, O courteous fair,</L>
<L>The motive of our unremitting care:</L>
<L>Know then, our wishes terminate in this,</L>
<L>And what we seek and crave is—Happiness.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FLORISSA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Long have we search'd throughout this bounteous isle,</L>
<L>With constant ardor and with ceaseless toil:</L>
<L>The various ways of various life we've tried,</L>
<L>But peace, sweet peace hath ever been deny'd.</L>
<L>We've sought in vain thro' ev'ry different state,</L>
<L>The rich, the poor, the lowly, and the great:</L>
<L>Doth she with Kings in palaces reside,</L>
<L>Or dwells obscurely, far from pomp and pride?</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="13"/>
To learn this truth, we've bid a long adieu</L>
<L>To all the shadows blinded men pursue.</L>
<L>—We seek URANIA, her whose virtues fire</L>
<L>Our virgin hearts to <HI>be</HI> what we <HI>admire.</HI></L>
<L>Report hath blazon'd her accomplish'd mind</L>
<L>The spotless mansion of the graces join'd;</L>
<L>For tho' with care she shuns the public eye,</L>
<L>Yet worth like her's, can ne'er obscurely lie.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAURINDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>On such a fair and faultless model form'd,</L>
<L>By prudence guided and by virtue warm'd;</L>
<L>Perhaps, FLORELLA can direct our youth,</L>
<L>And point our footsteps to the paths of truth?</L>

<SPEAKER>FLORELLA.</SPEAKER>
<L>New as I am to life's all varying scene,</L>
<L>Scarce knowing yet, what vice and virtue mean;</L>
<L>Unskill'd in points which sage experience shews,</L>
<L>I dare not solve the question you propose;</L>
<L>But wou'd you know the way to perfect bliss,</L>
<L>(Which virtue and the virtuous never miss:)</L>
<L>The Dame you seek inhabits yonder cell,</L>
<L>In her, united worth and wisdom dwell:</L>
<L>Poor, not dejected, humble, yet not mean,</L>
<L>Chearful, tho' grave, and lively, tho' serene:</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="14"/>
Benevolent, kind, pious, gentle, just,</L>
<L>Reason her guide, and Providence her trust.</L>
<L>If Heav'n, indulgent to her little store,</L>
<L>Adds to that little, but a little more:</L>
<L>With pious praise her grateful heart o'erflows,</L>
<L>And sweetly mitigates the sufferers woes.</L>
<L>Her labors for devotion best prepare,</L>
<L>And meek devotion smooths the brow of care.</L>
<L>Two lovely daughters make her little state,</L>
<L>The dearest blessings of propitious fate.</L>
<L>Under her kind protecting wing I live:</L>
<L>She gives to all—for she has much to give,</L>
<L>Since Heav'n hath bless'd her with an ample <HI>heart,</HI></L>
<L>A liberal <HI>soul</HI> which wou'd to all impart;</L>
<L>But, wise in all it's operations, join'd</L>
<L>A narrow fortune to a noble mind.</L>

<SPEAKER>PASTORELLA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Her bright perfections charm my listening ear!</L>
<L>Elate with hope, we come to seek her here:</L>
<L>To ask the way to virtue and to bliss,</L>
<L>Of her who boasts supremest Happiness.</L>

<SPEAKER>URANIA.</SPEAKER>
<L>YE tender objects of maternal love,</L>
<L>Ye dearest joys URANIA e'er can prove:</L>
<L>Behold another blessed morn arise,</L>
<L>Behold the Sun, all glorious, mount the skies!</L>
<L>Say, can you see this animating sight,</L>
<L>Without a fervent, pious, strong delight?</L>
<L>Does not that Sun, whose all-prolific ray</L>
<L>Inspires each object to be light and gay:</L>
<L>Does not that vivid pow'r teach ev'ry mind,</L>
<L>To be as warm, benevolent and kind:</L>
<L>To burn with unremitted ardor still,</L>
<L>Like him to execute their Maker's will?</L>
<L>Then, let us, Power Supreme! thy will adore,</L>

<L>Shalt thou these benefits in <HI>vain</HI> bestow?</L>
<L>Shall we forget the source from whence they flow?</L>

Teach us, thro' these to lift ourselves to Thee,</L>

<L>Nor let thy blessings hide Thee from our eyes:</L>
<L>From all obstructions clear our mental sight,</L>
<L>Pour on our souls thy beatific light:</L>
<L>Teach us thy wondrous goodness to revere,</L>
<L>With love to worship, and with rev'rence fear:</L>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE to HAMLET, Spoken by the late Mr. POWELL on his Benefit-Night, at the Theatre at <HI>Jacob's-Well,</HI> in 1765.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHEN genius flourish'd, and when SHAKESPEARE wrote,</L>
<L>When <HI>Plays</HI> nor wanted wit, nor <HI>Prologues</HI> thought:</L>
<L>Phoebus, to crown a merit so confess'd,</L>
<L>Decreed this boon to make his darling bless'd;</L>
<L>Two beauteous daughters of immortal JOVE,</L>
<L>(Enchanting virgins, form'd alone for love,)</L>
<L>He brought, and both beside the Poet plac'd,</L>
<L>Who, <HI>each</HI> admir'd, and <HI>each</HI> by turns embrac'd;</L>
<L>He knew not which to leave, nor which to chuse,</L>
<L>This was the Comic, that the Tragic Muse;</L>
<L>Now, Comedy, blithe, buxom, debonair,</L>
<L>Seem'd all his wish, ambition, pride and care;</L>
<L>Then, sweet MELPOMENE his soul possess'd,</L>
<L><HI>She</HI> was the gentlest, softest, loveliest, best;</L>
<L>To strains harmonious each attunes her lyre,</L>
<L>With solemn sweetness, or with living fire.</L>
<L>Perplex'd—the charm'd, divided Poet stood,</L>
<L>Transported, lost—alternately subdued.</L>
<L><PB N="33" REF="41"/>
Phoebus the wav'ring of his soul descried,</L>
<L>And pass'd his leave to make <HI>each</HI> fair his bride:</L>
<L>The God—strange sentence! 'tho' 'twas giv'n on high,</L>
<L>For this one time allow'd <HI>Polygamy.</HI></L>
<L>Th' enraptur'd bard unites each jarring wife,</L>
<L>And, wondrous tale! adores them both for life.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To-night, for <HI>your</HI> applause, <HI>my</HI> dearest fame,</L>
<L>I bring an offspring of the <HI>Tragic</HI> Dame;</L>
<L>No thundering hero angry JOVE defies,</L>
<L>Nor impious lover storms against the skies;</L>
<L>To draw the gen'rous, sympathetic tear,</L>
<L>The <HI>filial virtues</HI> shall to-night appear;</L>
<L>A flame so holy, and so chaste a zeal,</L>
<L>As Heav'n might look on, or as Saints might feel:</L>
<L>Beauties on beauties strike the dazzled eyes,</L>
<L>New beauties still on former beauties rise:</L>
<L>Oh nature! whence this pow'rful, magic sway,</L>
<L>That from our bosoms steals our souls away?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If, to draw characters most justly bright,</L>
<L>To contrast light with shade and shade with light:</L>
<L>To trace up passions to their inmost source,</L>
<L>And greatly paint them with uncommon force:</L>
<L>If these, obedient still to nature's laws,</L>
<L>Excite our wonder and exact applause,</L>
<L>Be these, immortal SHAKESPEARE! ever thine,</L>
<L>To feel, to praise, and to adore them, <HI>mine:</HI></L>
<L><PB N="34" REF="42"/>
Engrave thy genuine feelings on this breast,</L>
<L>Be all my bosom with thy stamp impress'd!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Pardon this tribute <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Weeps.</NOTE>—nature will have way,</L>
<L>To SHAKESPEARE <HI>nature</HI> must her tribute pay.</L>
<L>Nor think presumption claims too large a part,</L>
<L>If I aspire to boast a grateful heart.</L>
<L>Oh gratitude! thou deity confess'd,</L>
<L>Thou angel passion in a human breast,</L>
<L>Forgive, if dearer to my soul than fame</L>
<L>I steal one ray of thy celestial flame:</L>
<L>With honest transport bring the spark divine,</L>
<L>And offer it, as incense, at this shrine. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">To the Audience.</NOTE></L>

<HEAD>A PROLOGUE, Spoken at the Theatre in <HI>King-street, Bristol,</HI> by the late Mr. POWELL, to the Tragedy of KING LEAR, to introduce Mrs. POWELL, who ap∣peared in the Part of CORDELIA.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WITH grateful joy, with honest pride elate,</L>
<L>See, a Triumvir <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Theatre was conducted by three Managers, of which Mr. POWELL was one.</NOTE> of our little state.</L>
<L>In ancient <HI>Rome,</HI> by custom 'twas decreed,</L>
<L>That civic crowns shou'd be the victor's meed;</L>
<L>Let victor's wear the gift of public laws,</L>
<L>—<HI>My</HI> noblest civic crown is <HI>your</HI> applause!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thou, at whose shrine we nightly sacrifice,</L>
<L>Thou God of pathos, soul of SHAKESPEARE, rise!</L>
<L>Teach me thy melting, thy persuasive art,</L>
<L>To wake the tenderest feelings of the heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Blush not, ye good, ye grave, to shed a tear,</L>
<L>It falls from <HI>virtue</HI> if it falls for LEAR;</L>
<L>No wild licentious picture shall excite</L>
<L>The kindly dew-drops of your eyes to-night:</L>
<L>By no false colouring drawn, no lawless plan:</L>
<L>'Tis not the KING demands them,—'tis the MAN.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let meaner bards, uncertain of success,</L>
<L>Cloath their thin thoughts in all the pomp of dress:</L>
<L><PB N="36" REF="44"/>
When mighty Kings appear, let meaner bards</L>
<L>Place royalty in trappings, state and guards;</L>
<L>Our SHAKESPEARE scorns such paltry, futile arts,</L>
<L><HI>He,</HI> whilst he charms you, meliorates your hearts:</L>
<L>Rouses each nobler feeling of the mind,</L>
<L>His volume <HI>nature,</HI> and his theme <HI>mankind;</HI></L>
<L>For this, eternal honors grace his name,</L>
<L>And never-dying laurels crown his same!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The hoary monarch of to-night, aspires</L>
<L>To kindle <HI>pity's</HI> lamp at <HI>nature's</HI> fires.</L>
<L>Weakness and passion, tenderness and rage,</L>
<L>The fire of youth, the frowardness of age,</L>
<L>With filial cruelty's acutest sting,</L>
<L>Rend the sad bosom of a wretched King:</L>
<L>Unworthy, 'till by crushing woes distress'd,</L>
<L>Greatest when fall'n, and noblest when oppress'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now let me, trembling, lift an anxious eye,</L>
<L>And touch each chord of soft humanity;</L>
<L>Let me, in each kind face, read sweet applause,</L>
<L>Whilst I presume to plead a <HI>woman's</HI> cause;</L>
<L>To-night—the <HI>second</HI> aera of my life,</L>
<L>I venture here my <HI>pupil,</HI> more—my <HI>wife!</HI></L>
<L>Imagine all her doubts, and all her fears,</L>
<L>Her soft alarms, her apprehensive tears;</L>
<L>No sanguine hope her aching bosom fires,</L>
<L>No fancied fame her timid soul inspires;</L>
<L><PB N="37" REF="45" MS="y"/>
Indulge her with the sunshine of <HI>your</HI> praise,</L>
<L>A frown wou'd kill her, as a smile cou'd raise:</L>
<L>The fearful blossom will, with joy, expand,</L>
<L>If kindly nurtur'd by your fost'ring hand.</L>
<L>Come then, CORDELIA, come! for sages tell</L>
<L>'Tis worthy praise but to <HI>endeavour</HI> well;</L>
<L>Thus, hand in hand, to the same point we'll tend,</L>
<L>Nature our <HI>means,</HI> morality our <HI>end.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If modest hope be crown'd, if sweet success</L>
<L>Her humble wish, her rising efforts bless:</L>
<L>She'll think'twas <HI>here</HI> her trembling steps first mov'd,</L>
<L>And be more grateful as she's more approv'd;</L>
<L><HI>You</HI> she'll esteem her friends, her fame, her fate,</L>
<L>And from this hour her future fortunes date;</L>
<L>Then sinile, propitious smile, and make for life</L>
<L>One grateful <HI>Husband,</HI> and one happy <HI>Wife.</HI></L>
