<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THAT this Poem is authentic we have the best Authority: That it has high Merit no one will doubt, who has the smallest Pretension to Taste. It has all the Enthusiasm and poetic Colouring which suit the Ode; and it breathes a Spirit of Liberty that would not have disgraced a Citizen of Sparta, or of Rome.</P>

Immortal LIBERTY, whose look sublime</L>
<L>Hath blanch'd the Tyrant's Cheek in every varying Clime.</L>
<L>What Time the iron-hearted Gaul</L>
<L>With frantic Superstition for his Guide,</L>
<L>Armed with the Dagger and the Pall,</L>
<L>The Sons of Woden to the Field defy'd:</L>
<L>The ruthless Hag, by Weser's flood,</L>

<L>The Saxon Prince in Horror fled</L>

<L>And Liberty his routed Legions led</L>
<L>In Safety to the bleak Norwegian Shore.</L>
<L>There in a Cave asleep she lay,</L>

<L>When a bold Savage past that Way,</L>
<L>Impell'd by Destiny, his Name <HI>Disdain.</HI></L>
<L>Of ample Front the portly Chief appear'd:</L>
<L>The hunted Bear supplied a shaggy Vest;</L>
<L>The drifted Snow hung on his yellow Beard;</L>
<L>And his broad Shoulders brav'd the furious Blast.</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="9"/>
He stopt; he gazed; his Bosom glow'd,</L>
<L>And deeply felt th' Impression of her Charms:</L>

<L>Old Time exulted as he flew:</L>
<L>And INDEPENDENCE saw the Light.</L>
<L>The Light he saw in Albion's happy Plains,</L>
<L>Where under Cover of a flowering Thorn,</L>
<L>While Philomel renew'd her warbled Strains,</L>

The Mountain Dryads seiz'd with Joy,</L>

<L>As rolling Years matur'd his Age,</L>

<L>The fiercer Flames of his maternal Fire.</L>

<L>Accomplish'd thus, he wing'd his Way,</L>
