<HEAD>THE DRAM-SHOP; OR <HI>A PEEP INTO A PRISON.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>LOOK through the land from North to South,</L>
<L>And look from East to West;</L>
<L>And see what is to Irishmen,</L>
<L>Of Life the deadliest Pest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>It is not Want, tho' that is bad,</L>
<L>Nor war, tho' that is worse;</L>
<L>But Ireland's sons endure, alas!</L>
<L>A self-inflicted Curse.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Go where you will throughout the Realm</L>
<L>You'll find that every vice,</L>
<L>In Cities, Villages and Towns;</L>
<L>From WHISKEY takes its rise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Prince of darkness never sent</L>
<L>To Man a deadlier foe,</L>
<L>"My name is Legion," it may say,</L>
<L>The source of every woe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor does the fiend alone deprive</L>
<L>The labourer of his wealth;</L>
<L>That is not all, it murders too</L>
<L>His honest name and health.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>We say the times are grievous hard,</L>
<L>And hard they are, 'tis true;</L>
<L>But, Drunkards, to your wives and babes</L>
<L>They're harder made by you.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Drunkard's Tax is self-impos'd,</L>
<L>And hardest to endure,</L>
<L>Not all the Taxes half so much</L>
<L>Oppress the lab'ring poor.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The State compels no man to drink,</L>
<L>Compels no man to game;</L>
<L>'Tis vice and WHISKEY sink him down</L>
<L>To rags, and want, and shame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The kindest husband chang'd by these</L>
<L>Is for a tyrant known;</L>
<L>The tenderest heart that Nature made,</L>
<L>Becomes a heart of stone.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In many a house the harmless babes</L>
<L>Are poorly cloth'd and fed;</L>
<L>Because the craving DRAM-SHOP takes</L>
<L>The children's daily bread.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>It oft has robb'd the heedless youth</L>
<L>Of health and senses too,</L>
<L>And plung'd his never dying soul</L>
<L>In everlasting Woe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Come neighbour take a walk with me,</L>
<L>Thro' many a Dublin Street;</L>
<L>And see the cause of penury,</L>
<L>In hundreds we shall meet.</L>
</LG>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<LG>
<L>We shall not need to travel far—</L>
<L>Behold that great man's door;</L>
<L>He well discerns that idle crew,</L>
<L>From the deserving poor.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He will relieve with liberal hand</L>
<L>The child of honest thrift:</L>
<L>But where long scores at DRAM-SHOPS stand</L>
<L>He will with-hold his gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Behold that shivering female there,</L>
<L>Who plies her woeful trade!</L>
<L>Tis WHISKEY ten to one you'll find,</L>
<L>That hopeless wretch has made.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Look down those steps, and view below</L>
<L>Yon cellar under ground;</L>
<L>There every want, and every woe,</L>
<L>And every Sin, is found.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Those little wretches trembling there,</L>
<L>With hunger and with cold,</L>
<L>Were by their parents love of drink,</L>
<L>To Sin and Misery sold.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Blest be those friends <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>The Philanthropic Society.</HI></NOTE> to human kind,</L>
<L>Who take those wretches up,</L>
<L>Ere they have drunk the bitter dregs</L>
<L>Of their sad parents cup.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Look thro' that prison's iron bars,</L>
<L>Look thro' that dismal grate;</L>
<L>And learn what dire misfortunes brought</L>
<L>So terrible a fate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Debtor and the Felon too,</L>
<L>Tho' differing in disgrace,</L>
<L>By WHISKEY you'll too often find,</L>
<L>Were brought to this sad place.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet Heaven forbid I should confound</L>
<L>Calamity with guilt!</L>
<L>Or name the Debtor's lesser fault,</L>
<L>With blood of brother spilt.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To prison dire misfortunes oft</L>
<L>The guiltless debtor bring;</L>
<L>Yet oft'ner far it will be found</L>
<L>His Woes from WHISKEY spring.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>See the pale Manufact'rer there,</L>
<L>How lank and lean he lies!</L>
<L>How haggard is his sickly cheek!</L>
<L>How dim his hollow eyes!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He plied the loom with good success,</L>
<L>His wages still were high;</L>
<L>Twice what the village lab'rer gains,</L>
<L>His master did supply.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No book-debts kept him from his cash,</L>
<L>All paid as soon as due;</L>
<L>His wages on the Saturday</L>
<L>To <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail be never knew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How amply had his gains suffic'd,</L>
<L>On wife and children spent!</L>
<L>But all must for his pleasure go;</L>
<L>All to the DRAM-SHOP went.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>See that Apprentice, young in years;</L>
<L>But hackney'd long in vice,</L>
<L>What made him rob his master's till?</L>
<L>Ah! WHISKEY did entice.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That serving Man—I knew him once,</L>
<L>So jaunty, spruce, and smart!</L>
<L>Why did he steal, and pawn the plate?</L>
<L>'Twas WHISKEY snar'd his heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Turn now mine eye where Channel-row,</L>
<L>Displays yon mansion drear,</L>
<L>And ask each pale and shiv'ring wretch,</L>
<L>What misery drove him there.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O! woeful sight, say what cou'd cause,</L>
<L>Such poverty and shame?</L>
<L>Hark! hear his words, he owns the cause—</L>
<L>It all from WHISKEY came.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And when the future Lot is fix'd,</L>
<L>Of darkness, fire and chains,</L>
<L>How can the Drunkard hope to 'scape</L>
<L>Those everlasting pains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Since all his claim to heaven he sells</L>
<L>And drink the bestial cause,</L>
<L>Rejects the price his Saviour paid,</L>
<L>And disobeys his laws,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For if the Murd'rer's doom'd to woe,</L>
<L>As holy writ declares,</L>
<L>The Drunkard with SELF Murderers</L>
<L>That dreadful Portion shares.</L>
