<STAGE>SCENE <HI>The</HI> CAMP.</STAGE>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Captain Hearty, <HI>and</HI> Captain Wildish.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hearty.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Good Day to my dear Friend, what News have you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wildish.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have been with the General to reconnoitre the Enemy, they have not disturb'd our Foragers, but lie within their own Camp very quiet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Heart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sure if the Marquiss <HI>De Bay</HI> had a true Intel∣ligence of the Weakness of our Intrenchments, and the Mortality of our Men, he would have attack'd us before now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>In all the Campaigns I have served on these Frontiers, I never knew it so sickly; the General con∣tinues very much out of Order at <HI>Estremoz,</HI> they think both the Major Generals will die, and my Brigadier was carried to <HI>Elvas</HI> last Night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Heart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then at present Brigadier General <HI>Conquest</HI> commands our Forces.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Most certainly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Heart.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Death of half a Dozen of these great Men, would make a fine Alteration in our Titles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will assure you, Brigadier General <HI>Conquest</HI> could observe you were not at his Levee this Morn∣ing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Heart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why? I was upon the Piquet where you know, Drinking hard is the main Part of the Duty—besides, I never appear at the General's but upon Busi∣ness, for I can't slatter, and have a Stiffness between my Shoulders, that makes me incapable of Bowing low;
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>the Noise of the Peace gives me no prospect of rising, being pretty well assured the youngest Captain of an old Regiment, must wait for another War to get a bet∣ter Title.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why? I was once of the Gang of those silly Fellows, whose Ambition climb'd no higher than a Company in an old Regiment, which gave me a very distant Prospect of being provided for in Peace, when 'twas fifty to one I was knock'd on the Head before the War was over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Heart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Human Nature has always imprinted in us a Desire for Something above us, so gives us a Rotation of Uneasiness; and scarce in an Age do we meet with a Man that sits down pleased with his Condition, but we all lay Schemes, and make the present Time a Plague to us, in seeking after the next Plague, which is still to make us but the more miserable</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Fever, or the Bullet converts us to Dust and Ashes, and our next Heirs are left at Liberty to play the Fool after the same Manner; but hang these dismal Reflections.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Heart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is there no Courier from <HI>Lisbon,</HI> or News of a Packet from <HI>England.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>We hourly expect one—since our Forces have been ill, the <HI>Portugueze</HI> avoid us, and what is strange, none of their Men have the Distemper amongst them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Heart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Their Beads, the Priest's Blessing, and their Garlick are strong Preservatives of Health—But see, either my Sight fails me, or that Officer coming this Way, is my dear Major <HI>Buck.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>And with him a clever Parcel of Recruits.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Heart.</SPEAKER>
<P>They come to our Regiment very apropos, for we have scarce Men enough to mount the Guard.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter Major <HI>Buck, Wilmot</HI> in Granadier's Cloaths, Ser∣jeant <HI>File-off,</HI> several other Recruits with two Soldier's Wives.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major <HI>Buck.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Dear <HI>Charles!</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Heart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Major!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major <HI>Buck.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Dear <HI>Frank</HI> (to <HI>Wildish,</HI>) I'm intirely yours!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
<SPEAKER>Wild</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Boy! I'm over-joy'd to see you well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major <HI>Buck.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I am very much surpriz'd to find you so; for on our March, we heard a raging Sickness had swept most of you away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Distemper and false Musters have taken off most of our Men; but prithee what news from <HI>England?</HI> I know thou art a concise pretty Fellow, that can abbreviate an Account, without giving us Cause to ask impertinent Questions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major <HI>Buck.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I left all our Friends well at <HI>London,</HI> paid my Taylor's Bill, which was due last Voyage, ad∣justed my Accounts with our Rogue of an Agent, gave Security to St. <HI>Martin</HI>'s Parish for my Washerwoman's Bastard, mounted my Post-Horse at Noon-Day, reach'd <HI>Falmouth</HI> the Moment the <HI>Mercury,</HI> honest Captain <HI>Green,</HI> was failing, which had on Board my strapping Recruits, reached <HI>Lisbon</HI> in five Days; and after a fa∣tiguing March of ten more, am this moment arrived to my great Satisfaction, having met with my two best Friends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Heart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, But prithee—</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>(pulling him.)</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>P'shaw <HI>Hearty!</HI> Hold thy Tongue, and let me ask him some Questions—</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>(pulling him.)</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major <HI>Buck.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Looky' Gentlemen! These hailing Digressions of yours will very much prolong the Time my Story might be told in; come not within Arm's Length of me, and I will give you all the News, all the Scandal, all the Fashions and all the Pleasures of the Town.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Heart.</HI> and <HI>Wild.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Agreed then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major <HI>Buck.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>First I left our Royal Mistress in a very good State of Health, reigning intirely in the Hearts of her People, whose Representatives are doing Wonders; and by their well timed Zeal, and vast Supplies, shew the World they are still able to Balance <HI>Europe</HI>'s Power?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Heart.</HI> and <HI>Wild.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Very good.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major <HI>Buck.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The Taxes are paid chearfully, there's no Discount upon <HI>Exchequer</HI> Bills, and honest Soldiers are trusted by every Body. St <HI>James</HI>'s Coffee-House is full of grave Statesmen, whimsical Gentry, and cox∣combly Physicians. <HI>Young Man</HI>'s is filled with Military
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>Beau's Sea Gentlemen, and Admiralty Clerks. <HI>Gar∣raway</HI>'s with Knaves, Aldermen, Agents, Commissio∣ners of <HI>Excise,</HI> and now and then a straggling Beau. And the <HI>Court of Request</HI> with Country Gentlemen, Pe∣titioners, Freeholders, Sheriffs, and Politicians that hate Business. The Women of Quality have that dis∣cerning Taste of good Sense, that they always crowd the front Boxes at a good Play: And our rakelly young Fellows, live as much by their Wits as ever; and to a∣void the clinkling Dun of a Box-keeper, at the End of one Act, they Sneak to the opposite Side 'till the End of another; then call the Box-keeper saucy Rascal, ri∣dicule the Poet, laugh at the Actors, march to the Opera, and spunge away the rest of the Evening. The Wo∣men of the Town take their Places in the Pit, with their wonted Assurance. The middle Gallery is filled with the middle Part of the City: And your high ex∣alted Galleries are graced with handsom Footmen, that wear their Master's Linen, and their Mistresses Fa∣vours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>P'thaw! These are Generals, make haste and come to Particulars.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major <HI>Buck.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why! About three Months since in a Rencounter with a Lady, I got a Wound in my Con∣stitution, which was patched up by <HI>Bucheir.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Heart.</SPEAKER>
<P>With whose help, I suppose, you slatter your∣self you are sound.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major <HI>Buck.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>As a military Constitution can be: In short I levee'd all the Generals, and rising Statesmen, I taked and broke Windows, talk'd Politicks, beat the Watch, and bilk'd Coachmen, went into Mourning for my Father, and was drawn into half a Dozen Duels on my Friends Account, and kill'd no Body, won Money at Gaming, and yet used no false Dice; I went through all the Pleasures of the Town, without being a Bubble to any of them; saw all the handsome Women, with∣out falling in Love; and am come to serve under our General without Reluctancy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mighty concise truly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Heart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our Regiment is incamped on the Right of the Rear Line; you had best give Order, that your Men pitch your Tent next mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
<SPEAKER>Major <HI>Buck.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>My Baggage will be here immediately.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are there any new Fashions?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major <HI>Buck.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>This is my last new Coat, made exactly after the Manner of Beau <HI>Whimsey</HI>'s: This is the smart new fashion Cock — and this is the genteel walking Air; we salute thus—we ogle as we us'd to do; we have cut off all the superstitious Cere∣monies that attended our Love Passions, improve every Opportunity, come slap dash Alamode <HI>de Paris</HI> to the Question at once; give the Women no Time to think of the Spirit, and you are sure of their Persons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Heart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who came over in the Packet with you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major <HI>Buck.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Half a Dozen very wretched Volunteers, with prodigious strong Recommendations; and a Cou∣ple of small Ware Pedlars, who call themselves <HI>Lisbon</HI> Merchants, of whom I bought these Baubles.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter as from Horseback,</HI> Victoria <HI>and</HI> Belinda.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vict.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you observe, <HI>Belinda,</HI> the profound Respect we were received with, as we rid along the Line; my <HI>Spanish</HI> Jennet, was himself proud of my Father's Com∣manding the <HI>British</HI> Forces, and carried me with an Air of Greatness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never saw the Brigadier look better than he does to Day, the Morning is extreamly fine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vict.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think our whole Family are pretty well sea∣soned with the Country, and could I disengage myself from the mean spirited Creature my Father has provided for a Husband, you and I should pass our Time most pleasantly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee pluck up a Spirit, and tell him down right; you won't be married.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vict.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has been in every thing else the best of Fa∣thers, and if possible, I'll strive to oblige him in this; though, if it were not for my Mother's violence, I be∣lieve I might persuade him from it, (<HI>espying Major Buck.</HI>) Dear Child, what pretty Fellow is that with <HI>Wildish</HI> and <HI>Hearty?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis Major <HI>Buck</HI>—I suppose just arrived from <HI>England,</HI> he will be the Talk of the Camp for one Month.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vict.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee, why so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>For rakish Exploits—in <HI>Lisbon</HI> every Street us'd to be alarm'd by him; his Father died since he has been in <HI>England,</HI> and has left him a thousand Pounds a Year, which will give him the Opportunity of com∣mitting a Thousand more Vices than he us'd to do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vict.</SPEAKER>
<P>He's really a pretty Fellow, Why could not my Father have picked out such a Man for me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh fie, Child! He's the wickedest young Fellow in the World, and won't suffer any Body to speak in the Behalf of a virtuous Woman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vict.</SPEAKER>
<P>If he is a Man of Sense that Wildness and Gay∣ety will wear off.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! Never! Never! He's a nauseous Fellow, I can't help thinking the <HI>Santista,</HI> Mr. <HI>Bisket,</HI> a much more agreeable Man than he.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vict.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now you rally me <HI>Belinda,</HI> I am but just come to bear the fight of him, and fear I never can be brought to like him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Bisket</HI>'s assable Temper and good Nature, will soon work upon you.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>The Gentlemen talk.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>These are pretty Baubles for a Man of an Es∣tate to Murder Money with?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Heart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very pretty Trifles truly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major <HI>Buck.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What charming Creatures are these?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Heart.</SPEAKER>
<P>One is your old Friend <HI>Belinda,</HI> the Daugh∣ter of your late Colonel, who left her to the Care of the Brigadier: And the other is Brigadier General <HI>Con∣quest</HI>'s Daughter, who with her Mother was sent for from <HI>Lisbon</HI> on his late Illness; they say she is to be married to Mr. <HI>Bisket,</HI> the <HI>Santista,</HI> who supplies the Army with Bread and Forage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major <HI>Buck.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I protest she has fine brilliant piercing Eyes, and therefore I'll forbid the Banes; she gives me a pretty thrilling Pain about my Heart; she sets my Soul on Fire, and I must have her: Serjeant, prepare the Men for an Attack, I am resolved to countermine <HI>Bisket,</HI> blow up all his Outworks, and take that fair Citadel Sword in Hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Most heroickly express'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major <HI>Buck.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Now will I fix myself in a very languish∣ing Posture, fire both my Eyes at her, and I'll lay my
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>Life on't, one of them shall do Execution in some Cor∣ner of her Heart; ha, Faith she returns the Ogle! I am sure she must be a Prize—
<STAGE>(Kisses her Hand.)</STAGE> Oh these dear charming Eyes have captivated my very Soul!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Heart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee be more modest, consider her Father is your General.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>(Holding him.)</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Impudent Creature to take no Notice of me.
<STAGE>(Aside.) (Victoria.)</STAGE> Did you ever see any Thing so saucy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vict.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor so agreeable, upon my Word.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why! Sure you can't like so profligate a Fel∣low!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vict.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not desperately in Love with him, but should not be mighty uneasy were he to deliver me from my frightful Coxcomb.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, It was but this Moment you were talking of Duty and Gratitude to Parents.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vict.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's probable, the next Moment I shall talk of them again; but, Child, I'm Flesh and Blood, and a handsome young Fellow, will give me some fluttering Airs, and a Palpitation about my Heart, in spite of my Duty and resigned Will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>He's a satyrical ugly Fellow that writes Lam∣poons; I was sorry to see you return his Ogle, in a Week's Time, he'll swear he has been intriguing with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vict.</SPEAKER>
<P>That certainly will secure my Reputation; for you and I know, what a Red Coat says of our Sex goes for Nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm vex'd to see her have so little Spleen;
<STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE> come, <HI>Victoria,</HI> your Mother expects us to drink Tea with her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vict.</SPEAKER>
<P>One look more and I go.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faugh upon the Fellow.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>(Exeunt Women.)</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, very well, you have drove 'em away; I suppose they'll tell the Mother of your Rudeness, she acquaints the Brigadier General, he sends you out upon the next dangerous Attack, and off goes a Cannon, and a pretty Fellow within half a Minute of one ano∣ther.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>Major <HI>Buck.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why? that very Accident will prove I died for Love of her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Heart.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Ergo,</HI> your saucy Love was the Occasion of your Death.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major <HI>Buck.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But prithee. <HI>Wildish,</HI> doest thou believe when I shall have aquainted the General with the Death of my Father, that my Estate will not be a more pre∣vailing Argument, than <HI>Bisket</HI>'s Riches?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>No! The old Woman hates a Soldier, and the Brigadier General loves Money so much, that I believe he cannot have the Heart to part with any to his Daughter; they say all Things are agreed on, and he is expected up from <HI>Lisbon</HI> on purpose to marry her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Heart.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is to give her no Money, and the Lover has sent her Silk for Wedding Cloaths.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major <HI>Buck.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Heark'e I'll take her stark Naked, and settle all I have upon her! I'll immediately go to the General, I have a Packet for him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis your Duty to acquaint him with your Arrival, and you must give in a list of your Recruits.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Heart.</SPEAKER>
<P>I warrant you imagine all those tall handsome Fellows must be Part of your Company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major <HI>Buck.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Most certainly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, The Regiment is to draw Cuts for them; therefore if you have any Fancy to a particular Man, write Servant against him in the List.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major <HI>Buck.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I have one clever Fellow, I should be much concerned should I lose him. March forward, <HI>Straitup.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>A well built Fellow of <HI>Ireland,</HI> I suppose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir—I'm of <HI>England.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Heart.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Fellow has the Air and Mein of a Gen∣tleman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE> I'm sorry he thinks so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>What was the Reason of your coming into the Army, Friend?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, Besides, having had a Bastard laid to me, I had committed some Roguery in the Country, was afraid of being hanged, and so listed myself for a Soldier.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which, Friend, is only a Reprieve from Death, and the next Attack may sign your dead Warrant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Heart.</SPEAKER>
<P>If this Fellow falls to my Lot, I'll make a Corporal of him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Were he mine, I'd give him Serjeant's Pay, and his Duty should be Combing my Wigs, and Pimp∣ing for me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major <HI>Buck.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The Account he gives you of himself is fictitious, and I am informed by his Comrades, he has something of the Gentleman in him; for he lifts up his Eyes when they steal a Pig, cut the Throat of a <HI>Portuguese,</HI> or build a Sconce.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Heart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heark'e, Friend; if you have any Notion of Conscience, you had better have staid in <HI>England</HI> to have been lawfully hanged.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>See yonder's the General alighted from his Horse. That <HI>Portuguese</HI> Nobleman's House is his Quarters.</P>

<P>There are abundance of each, Madam.

Harlots keep visiting Days, as well as Women of Ho∣nour; they appear at the Church, and the Play-House, with a very modest Assurance; to be call'd my Lord <HI>Whatd'callm</HI>'s Mistress, is as genteel and more Modish a Name, than my Lord <HI>Whata'callm</HI>'s Wife: And at the End of an <HI>Opere,</HI> you often hear my Lord-Duke's Footman call'd for, Mrs. <HI>Simper</HI> having order'd her Flambeaux to be lighted.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Con.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Your Disobedience surprises me; have not your Father and I agreed upon the Matter? Don't we know what's best for silly Girls, who are not fit Judges for themselves?

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Con.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>So so, a fine Character truly; and where do you expect to find such a Husband as this— Your Father laid out all his ready Money to buy the Regiment, if there should come a Peace—'tis a young one: He'll be broke, and half pay will not maintain us—Here you'll be at the Head of the Fac∣tory; keep your Chaise and your Litter; be visited by the Envoy, and sit next the Consul's Lady.</P>
