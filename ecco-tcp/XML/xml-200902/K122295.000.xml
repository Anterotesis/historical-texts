<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I KNOW not whether mankind can be said to have less Vanity—but of this I am certain, that they have infi∣nitely more Delicacy—formerly, Dedi∣cators met with few difficulties in ad∣dressing their Patrons—They made them every thing that was wise and good, and their Patrons, in return, (though they might not approve the production) yet gave their authors an entire credit for a clear insight into human nature.
<PB N="ii" REF="3"/>
But contraband traffick brings many a good trade into disrepute, and a fair dealer has now often only a limited op∣portunity of vending his just merchan∣dise. How hard then is the condition of us modern Dedicators! To lavish encomiums where they are not due, is not the fashion of the times; and now, (when the Subject demands, and there is the fairest opportunity of ex∣patiating on the most exemplary Cha∣racter) I have your LADYSHIP's express prohibition—But public disorders fre∣quently bring the seeds of remedy along with them—If I had spoken as I ought, it had been called an UNIVERSAL opi∣nion, (and your LADYSHIP perceives, by this address, that I affect singularity;) but should I in the least have failed, the world would have loudly exclaimed, that

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Written by Dr. GOLDSMITH.
Spoken by Mr. QUICK.</BYLINE>
<L>IN these bold times, when Learning's sons explore</L>
<L>The distant climate and the savage shore;</L>
<L>When wise <HI>Astronomers</HI> to <HI>India</HI> steer,</L>
<L>And quit for <HI>Venus,</HI> many a brighter here;</L>
<L>While <HI>Botanists,</HI> all cold to smiles and dimpling,</L>
<L>Forsake the fair, and patiently—go simpling;</L>
<L>When every bosom swells with wond'rous scenes,</L>
<L>Priests, cannibals, and hoity-toity queens:</L>
<L>Our bard into the general spirit enters,</L>
<L>And fits his little frigate for adventures:</L>
<L>With <HI>Scythian stores,</HI> and trinkets deeply laden,</L>
<L>He this way steers his course, in hopes of trading—</L>
<L>Yet ere he lands he'as ordered me before,</L>
<L>To make an observation on the shore.</L>
<L>Where are we driven? Our reck'ning sure is lost!</L>
<L>This seems a barren and a dangerous coast.</L>
<L>Lord what a sultry climate am I under!</L>
<L>Yon ill-foreboding cloud seems big with thunder. <STAGE>(Upper Gallery.)</STAGE></L>
<L><PB REF="6"/>
There Mangroves spread, and larger than I've seen 'em— <STAGE>(Pit.)</STAGE></L>
<L>Here trees of stately size—and turtles in 'em— <STAGE>(Balconies.)</STAGE></L>
<L>Here ill-condition'd oranges abound— <STAGE>(Stage.)</STAGE></L>
<L>And apples <STAGE>(takes up one and tastes it)</STAGE> <HI>bitter</HI> apples strew the ground.</L>
<L>The place is uninhabited I fear;</L>
<L>I heard a hissing—there are serpents here!</L>
<L>O there the natives are—a dreadful race!</L>
<L>The men have tails, the women paint the face!</L>
<L>No doubt they're all barbarians—Yes, 'tis so,</L>
<L>I'll try to make palaver with them though; <STAGE>(making signs)</STAGE></L>
<L>'Tis best however keeping at a distance.</L>
<L>Good Savages, our Captain craves assistance;</L>
<L>Our ship's well stor'd;—in yonder creek we've laid her,</L>
<L>His honour is no mercenary trader;</L>
<L>This is his first adventure, lend him aid,</L>
<L>Or you may chance to spoil a thriving trade.</L>
<L>His goods he hopes are prime, and brought from far,</L>
<L>Equally fit for gallantry and war.</L>
<L>What no reply to promises so ample?</L>
<L>I'd best step back—and order up a sample.</L>

<L>Our troops, whose minds no dangers can appal,</L>
<L>Observing from afar some hasty steps,</L>

<L>Whilst they present to our astonish'd sight</L>
<L>Rich trappings, blazing shields, gold, diamonds, pearls,</L>
<L>The guilty spoils of desolating war:</L>

<L>The sun, which rises o'er yon eastern hill,</L>

<L>Thou little know'st the secrets of my heart;</L>

<L>What fate mysterious lur'd him to these climes;</L>

<L>To this fair country's maxims and her laws</L>

<L>They flow from tenderness and former cares:</L>

The monsters, who surround the impious Smerdis,</L>

<L>Extend your mercy to my sole request!</L>
<L>Let one small spot enclose our last remains,</L>
<L>'Tis all I ask, and Persia will requite you.</L>
<L>What now is all the baseless dream of power,</L>
<L>Ambition's fire, the lust of wealth or empire?</L>
<L>The scene once clos'd, each glittering prospect fails—</L>
<L>The dreary mansions of the peaceful grave</L>
<L>Receive alike the Scythian and the Monarch.</L>
<L>Now, now I sink—my Zobeide—mercy, Heaven!</L>

<L>Bear off my wretched friend—woes great as these</L>
<L>Press heavy on his years—Submit we to our fate:</L>
<L>Submit we to the stern award of awful heaven;</L>
<L>My son, my country, and the Gods appeas'd,</L>
<L>Mercy usurps the rigid seat of justice,</L>
<L>And weeps in mournful tribute o'er their graves.</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By Mr. MURPHY. Spoken by Mrs. YATES.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>WELL fare the man, peace to his gentle shade,</L>
<L>The Bard who first made Epilogues a trade;</L>
<L>Else what a life an Actress must pursue?—</L>
<L>To weep and rave is all she'd have to do;</L>
<L>Upon the Stage, with warring passions sore,</L>
<L>"To fret her hour, and then be heard no more."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now, after poison, daggers, rage, and death,</L>
<L>We come again to take a little breath;</L>
<L>Rally the Pit; set Belles and Beaux at odds,</L>
<L>And be a mere free-thinker to the Gods; <STAGE>[To the upper gallery.</STAGE></L>
<L>Chat in familiar strain; the Boxes maul;</L>
<L>—An Epilogue, like gaming—levels all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not e'en poor <HI>Bayes</HI> within must hope to be</L>
<L>Free from the lash:—His Play he writ for me,</L>
<L>'Tis true—and now my gratitude you'll see.</L>

<L>Why ramble with <HI>Voltaire</HI> to Eastern climes,</L>
<L>To Scythian laws, and antiquated times?</L>
<L>Change but the names, his Tragedy, at best,</L>
<L>Slides into Comedy, and turns to jest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As thus—A Statesman, old, and out of place,</L>
<L>Sour, discontented, malice in his face,</L>
<L>(In these blest days, we but suppose the case)</L>
<L>Flies from <HI>St. James's</HI> to his own estate,</L>
<L>To chew the wisdom of each past debate;</L>
<L>How in the House he made a glorious stir,</L>
<L>With, "Sir, I move"—and, "Mr. Speaker, Sir!"</L>
<L><HI>Zobeide</HI>'s his daughter <HI>Sophy:—</HI>Oh! farewell</L>
<L>For her each haunt that charms a modern Belle!</L>
<L>Adieu <HI>Almack's! Cornelly's</HI> Masquerade!</L>
<L>Sweet <HI>Ranelagh! Vauxhall's</HI> enchanting shade!</L>
<L>Squire Groom makes love; Rich? yes; a vast domain;</L>
<L>Well-bred?—the savage Scythian of the Plain!</L>
<L>The match is fix'd; deeds sign'd; the knot is ty'd;</L>
<L>Down comes my Lord in all his glitt'ring pride.</L>
<L>And will my Angel chuse this rustic plan?</L>
<L>"Oh! Cuckold him by all means; I'm your man."</L>
<L>Now mark our Author's ignorance of life?</L>
<L>What, not elope? Is that a modish Wife?</L>
<L><PB REF="92"/>
Poor fool! she doubts; says No: the Husband dies:</L>
<L>Now stab yourself, says <HI>Bayes;</HI> but Nature cries,</L>
<L>How! sacrifice myself for vain Renown!</L>
<L><HI>John,</HI> put the horses to, and drive to town.</L>
<L>That would be life; the manners; painted high!</L>
<L>But our Bard makes,—to moisten ev'ry eye,</L>
<L>A Widow with a Prince refuse to fly.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet, after all, excuse him, Ladies, pray;</L>
<L>For sure there is some Nature in his Play.</L>
<L>A first attempt let no keen Censure blight,</L>
<L>Hereafter he may soar a nobler flight;</L>
<L>Drop one kind tear; give him that slender token;</L>
<L>And hither come, till the <HI>Pantheon</HI> open.</L>
