<P>IT seems somewhat extraordinary, that altho' with persons of merit, no virtue stands in higher estimation than the love of truth; yet the surest means to offend them in addrsses of this nature, is a strict ad∣herence to it; and it will be a singular cir∣cumstance to see a Dedication without praise, to a Lady possessed of every quality and ac∣complishment, which can justly intitle her to it.</P>

<HEAD>THE ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the great names, which have done honor to antiquity in general, and to the Roman Republic in particular, that of <HI>Marcus Attilius Regulus</HI> has, by the general consent of all ages, been considered as one of the most respectable, since he not only sacrificed his labours, his liberty, and his life for the good of his country; But by a greatness of soul, almost peculiar to himself, contrived to make his very misfortunes contribute to that glorious end.</P>
<P>After the Romans had met with various successes in the first Punic War, under the command of Regulus, victory at length declared for the opposite party, the Roman Army was totally overthrown, and Regulus himself taken prisoner, by <HI>Xantip∣pus,</HI> a Lacedoemonian General in the service of the Cartha∣ginians: the victorious enemy, exulting in so important a conquest, kept him many years in close imprisonment, and loaded him with the most cruel Indignities. They thought it was new in their power to make their own terms with Rome, and determined to send Regulus thither, with their Ambassador, to negotiate a peace, or at least, an exchange of captives, thinking be would gladly persuade his coun∣trymen to discontinue a war, which necessarily prolonged his captivity. They previously exacted from him an oath to return should his embassy prove unsuccessful; at the same time giving him to understand, that he must expect to suffer a cruel death if he failed in it; this they artfully intimated, as the strongest motive for him to leave no means unattempt∣ed to accomplish their purpose.</P>
<P>At the unexpected arrival of this venerable hero, the Ro∣mans express'd the wildest transports of joy, and would have submitted to almost any conditions to procure his en∣largement;
<PB REF="4" MS="y"/>
but, Regulus so far from availing himself of his influence with the Senate to obtain any personal advan∣tages, employed it to induce them to reject proposals so evi∣dently tending to dishonour their country, declaring his fixed resolution to return to bondage, and death, rather than violate his cath.</P>
<P>He at Last extorted from them their consent; and depart∣ed amidst the tears of his family, the importunities of his friends, the applauses of the Senate, and the tumultuous opposition of the people; and as a great poet of his own na∣tion beautifully observes, <Q>he embarked for Carthage as calm and unconcerned, as if, on finishing the tedious law-suits of his clients, he was retiring to Vena<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rian fields, or the sweet country of <HI>Tarentum.</HI></Q><NOTE PLACE="foot">HOR. Book III. Ode 5.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the above, and many other important parti∣culars, the Author has paid the strictest regard to historical truth: In some less essential points, where she thought it would rather obstruct than advance her purpose, she has ventured to deviate from it; parti∣cularly, in fixing the return of Regulus to Rome, posterior to the death of his wife Martia. In <HI>this,</HI> and in the <HI>general</HI> conduct of the story, she has followed the Italian poet Metastasio in his Opera of <HI>three</HI> acts: of which she has given a free translation, and made such <HI>additions,</HI> as were necessary to form it into a tragedy of <HI>five</HI> acts.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY THE REV. DR. LANGHORNE.</BYLINE>
<L>DEEP in the bosom of departed days,</L>
<L>Where the first gems of human glory blaze;</L>
<L>Where, crown'd with flowers, in wreaths immortal drest,</L>
<L>The sacred shades of ancient virtue rest;</L>
<L>With joy they search, who joy can feel, to find</L>
<L>Some honest reason still to love mankind.</L>
<L>There the fair foundress of the scene to night,</L>
<L>Explores the paths that dignify delight;</L>
<L>The regions of the mighty dead pervades;</L>
<L>The sybil she that leads us to the shades.</L>
<L>O may each blast of ruder breath forbear</L>
<L>To wast her light leaves on the worthless air,</L>
<L>Since she, as heedless, strives not to maintain</L>
<L>This tender offspring of her teeming brain:</L>
<L>For this poor birth was no provision made,</L>
<L>A flower that sprung, and languish'd in the shade.</L>
<L>On Avon's banks, forsaken and forlorn,</L>
<L>This careless mother left her elder born;</L>
<L>And tho' unlike that Avon hail'd of yore,</L>
<L>Those giant sons that Shakespeare's banners bore,</L>
<L>Yet may we yield this little offspring grace,</L>
<L>And love the last and least of such a race.</L>
<L>Shall the strong scenes, where senatorial Rome</L>
<L>Mourn'd o'er the rigour of her patriot's doom;</L>
<L>Where melting nature, aw'd by virtue's eye,</L>
<L>Hid the big drop, and held the bursting sigh;</L>
<L>Where all that Majesty of soul can give,</L>
<L>Truth, honor, pity, fair affection, live;</L>
<L>Shall scenes like these, the glory of an age,</L>
<L>Gleam from the press, nor triumph on the stage</L>
<L>Forbid it, Britons! and, as Romans brave,</L>
<L>Like Romans boast one citizen to save.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Licin.</SPEAKER>
<L>AH, my Attilia, do I find thee here?</L>
<L>Is this a place for Regulus's daughter?</L>
<L>Just Gods! must that incomparable maid</L>
<L>Associate here with Lictors and Plebeians?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Attil.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yes, on this threshold patiently I wait</L>
<L>The Consul's coming; I would make him blush</L>
<L>To see me here his suitor. O Licinius,</L>
<L>This is no time for form, and cold decorum;</L>
<L>Five lagging years have crept their tedious round</L>
<L>And Regulus, alas! is, still a slave;</L>
<L>A wretched slave, unpitied, and forgotten;</L>
<L>No other tribute paid his memory,</L>
<L>Than the sad tears of his unhappy child;</L>
<L>If <HI>she</HI> be silent who will speak for Regulus?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Licin.</SPEAKER>
<L>Let not her sorrows make my Fair unjust.</L>
<L>Is there in Rome a heart so dead to virtue</L>
<L>That does not beat in Regulus's cause?</L>
<L>That wearies not the Gods for his return?</L>
<L>That does not think all subjugated Afric,</L>
<L>A slender, unimportant acquisition,</L>
<L>If, in return, for all this added empire,</L>
<L>The freedom of thy father be the purchase?</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="8"/>These are <HI>Rome</HI>'s feelings, for my lov'd Attilia,</L>
<L>If were superfluous, to declare <HI>my own.</HI></L>
<L>If thy <HI>Licinius</HI> were to weigh his merit,</L>
<L>That he's <HI>thy father</HI> were sufficient glory.</L>
<L>He was my leader, train'd me up to arms,</L>
<L>And if I boast some sparks of Roman honor,</L>
<L>I owe them to his precepts and <HI>his</HI> virtues.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Attil.</SPEAKER>
<L>And yet I have not aught observ'd, Li∣cinius—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Licin.</SPEAKER>
<L>Ah! spare me thy reproaches—what could I</L>
<L>When but a private Citizen perform?</L>
<L>'Tis not the lust of power, or pride of rank,</L>
<L>Has made me seek the dignity of Tribune;</L>
<L>No, my Attilia, but I fondly hop'd</L>
<L>'Twould strengthen and inforce the just request,</L>
<L>Which as a <HI>private</HI> man I <HI>vainly</HI> made;</L>
<L>But now, the people's representative,</L>
<L>I shall <HI>demand,</HI> Attilia, to be heard.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Attil.</SPEAKER>
<L>Ah! let us not too hastily apply</L>
<L>This dang'rous remedy; I would not rouse</L>
<L>Fresh tumults 'twixt the people and the senate:</L>
<L>Each views with jealousy the idol, power,</L>
<L>Which, each possessing, would alike abuse.</L>
<L>Whatever wish'd-for boon the <HI>one</HI> demands,</L>
<L>The <HI>other</HI> thro' reluctant pride denies.</L>
<L>Might <HI>I</HI> advise you, try a <HI>gentler</HI> method;</L>
<L>I know that every moment Rome expects</L>
<L>Th' Ambassador of Carthage, and I've heard</L>
<L>The Conscript Fathers are already met</L>
<L>To give him audience in Bellona's temple.</L>
<L>There might the Consul at my suit, Licinius,</L>
<L>Propose the ransom of my captive father.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Licin.</SPEAKER>
<L>Ah! think, Attilia, who that Consul is,</L>
<L>Manlius, thy father's rival, and his foe:</L>
<L>His ancient rival, and his foe prosess'd;</L>
<L>To hope in him, my fair, were fond delusion.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Attil.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yet, tho' his <HI>rival,</HI> Manlius is a <HI>Roman:</HI></L>
<L>Nor will he think of private enmities,</L>
<L>Weigh'd in the balance with the good of Rome.</L>
<L>Let me at least make trial of his honour.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Licin.</SPEAKER>
<L>Be it so, my fair, but <HI>elsewhere</HI> make thy suit,</L>

<L>Yes, I will see him <HI>here,</HI> e'en <HI>here,</HI> Lici∣nius.</L>

<L>O sweet, yet powerful influence of virtue,</L>

<L>And what was love exalts to admiration!</L>
<L>Yes, 'tis the privilege of souls like thine</L>
<L>To conquer most when least they aim at conquest.</L>
<L>Yet, ah! vouchsafe, thou noblest among women,</L>
<L>Sometimes to think with pity on Licinius,</L>
<L>Nor fear to rob thy father of his due;</L>
<L>For surely Virtue, and the Gods, approve</L>
<L>Unwearied constancy, and spotless love.</L>

<SPEAKER>Attil.</SPEAKER>
<L>Ah! Manlius stay, a moment stay, and hear me.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Manl.</SPEAKER>
<L>I did not think to meet thee here, Attilia,</L>
<L>Here, in a place so little worthy of thee.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Attil.</SPEAKER>
<L>It <HI>were</HI> unworthy, did Attilia boast</L>
<L>A godlike father free from cruel bondage;</L>
<L>But for the daughter of a slave to Carthage,</L>
<L>It surely is most sitting.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Manl.</SPEAKER>
<L>Say, Attilia,</L>
<L>What is the purpose of thy coming hither?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Attil.</SPEAKER>
<L>What is the purpose, patience, patience,</L>
<L>Heaven!</L>
<L>Tell me, how long, to Rome's eternal shame,</L>
<L>To fill with horror all the wond'ring world,</L>
<L>My father still must groan in Punic chains,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="10"/>And waste the tedious hours in sad captivity?</L>
<L>Days follow days, and years to years succeed,</L>
<L>And Rome forgets her hero is a slave.</L>
<L>Has he, alas! <HI>deserv'd</HI> to be forgotten?</L>
<L>What is his crime? is it to have preferr'd</L>
<L>His country's profit to his children's good?</L>
<L>Is it th' unshaken firmness of his soul,</L>
<L>Just, uncorrupt, invariably good?</L>
<L>Perhaps his <HI>pov'erty</HI> has been his fault,</L>
<L><HI>Poor</HI> in the highest dignities of <HI>Rome:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Illustrious error, glorious poverty!</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Manl.</SPEAKER>

<L>Yet awhile attend.</L>
<L>And can ungrateful <HI>Rome</HI> so soon forget?</L>
<L>Can those who breathe the air <HI>he</HI> breath'd forget</L>
<L>The great, the godlike virtues of my father?</L>
<L>There's not <HI>a part</HI> of Rome but speaks his praise.</L>
<L>The <HI>streets</HI>—thro' them the <HI>hero</HI> pass'd triumphant</L>
<L>The <HI>Forum</HI>—there the <HI>Legislator</HI> plann'd</L>
<L>The wisest, wholsomest, and purest laws;</L>
<L>The <HI>Senate-house</HI>—there spoke the <HI>patriot Roman,</HI></L>
<L>There oft' his voice secur'd the public safety:</L>
<L>The wisdom of his councils match'd his valor.</L>
<L>Enter the <HI>Temples</HI>—mount the <HI>Capitol.</HI>—</L>

<L>They owe their trophies, and their ornaments,</L>

<L>Tarentine, Punic, and Sicilian spoils?</L>

<L>This man of virtue, this immortal Roman,</L>
<L>In base requital for his services,</L>
<L>Is left to linger out a life in chains,</L>
<L>No honors paid him but a daughter's tears,</L>
<L>O Rome! O Regulus! O thankless Citizens!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Manl.</SPEAKER>
<L>Just are thy tears:—Thy father well deserves them</L>
<L>But know thy censure is unjust, Attilia.</L>
<L>The fate of Regulus is felt by all:</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="11"/>We know and mourn the cruel woes he suffers</L>
<L>From barbarous Carthage.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Attil.</SPEAKER>
<L>Manlius, you mistake,</L>
<L>Alas! it is not Carthage, which is barbarous;</L>
<L>'Tis Rome, ungrateful Rome is the Barbarian;</L>
<L>Carthage but punishes a foe profess'd,</L>
<L>But Rome betrays her hero, and her father;</L>
<L>Carthage remembers how he slew her sons,</L>

<L>Carthage revenges an acknowledg'd foe,</L>

<L>WHAT son of physic, but his art extends,</L>
<L>As well as hand, when call'd on by his friends?</L>
<L>What landlord is so weak to make you fast,</L>
<L>When guests like you bespeak a good repast?</L>
<L>But weaker still were he whom sate has plac'd</L>
<L>To sooth your cares, and gratify your taste,</L>
<L>Should be neglect to bring before your eyes</L>
<L>Those dainty dramas which from Genius rise;</L>
<L>Whether your luxury be to smile or weep,</L>
<L>His and your profits just proportion keep.</L>
<L>To night he brought, nor fears a due reward,</L>
<L>A Roman patriot by a female bird.</L>
<L>Britons who feel his flame, his worth will rate,</L>
<L>No common spirit his, no common fate,</L>
<L>INFLEXIBLE and CAPTIVE must be great.</L>
<L>"How," cries a sucking fop, thus lounging, straddling,</L>
<L>(Whose head shews want of ballast by its noddling)</L>
<L>"A woman write? learn, madam, of your betters,</L>
<L>"And read a noble Lord's <HI>Post-hu-mous Letters.</HI></L>
<L>"There you will learn the sex may merit praise,</L>
<L>"By making puddings—not by making plays:</L>
<L>"They can make tea and mischief, dance and sing;</L>
<L>"Their heads, tho' full of feathers, can't take wing."</L>
<L>I thought they cou'd, Sir;—now and then by chance,</L>
<L>Maids fly to Scotland, and some wives to France.</L>
<L>He still went noddling on—"Do all she can,</L>
<L>"Woman's a trifle—play-thing—like her fan;</L>
<L>Right, Sir, and when a wife the <HI>rattle</HI> of man.</L>
<L>And shall such things as these become the test</L>
<L>Of female worth? the fairest and the best</L>
<L>Of all heaven's creatures? for so Milton sung us,</L>
<L>And with such champions, who shall dare to wrong us?</L>
<L>Come forth, proud man, in all your powers array'd;</L>
<L>Shine out in all your splendor—Who's afraid?</L>
<L>Who on French wit has made a glorious war,</L>
<L>Defended Shakespear, and subdu'd Voltaire?</L>
<L>Woman<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mrs. Montaga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, author of an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> writings of Shakespeare.</NOTE>—Who, rich in knowledge, knows no pride,</L>
<L>Can boast ten tongues, and yet not satisfied?</L>
<L>Woman<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mrs.Carter, well known for her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and modern languages.</NOTE>—Who lately sung the sweetest lay?</L>
<L>A woman, woman, woman<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Miss Aikin, who latly published some excellent poems.</NOTE> still I say.</L>
<L>Well then, who dares deny our power and might?</L>
<L>Will any married man dispute our right?</L>
<L>Speak boldly, Sirs,—your wives are not in sight.</L>
<L>What! are you silent? then you are content;</L>
<L>Silence, the proverb tells us, gives consent.</L>
<L>Critics, will you allow our honest claim?</L>
<L>Are you dumb too? This night has fix'd our fame.</L>
