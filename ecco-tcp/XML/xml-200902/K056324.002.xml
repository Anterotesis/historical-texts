</ARGUMENT>
<P><MILESTONE N="1692" UNIT="year"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Observati∣ons.</NOTE> WILLIAM had obtained the crown, through the folly of his predecessor. He was now in danger of losing it, by his own negligence. Disappointments in their views, had estranged from him the minds of the Whigs. He disgusted the Tories with the coldness of his manner, even when he distinguished them most with his favour. The dissolution of the convention-parliament, had di∣minished
<PB N="2" REF="13"/>
the influence of the former, to a degree that offended their pride. They saw a Prince, who had ascended the throne upon their own principles, throw∣ing himself into the hands of their political oppo∣nents, from an avowed affection for those prerogatives which he was called to circumscribe. The same con∣duct which deprived the King of the attachment of his first friends in England, destroyed his interest with the party which had accomplished the revolution in Scot∣land. In both kingdoms, the seeds of discontent had been sown with a lavish hand; and they gradually rose to maturity, in the progress of events. The people in general, inflamed by disappointment, misled by design∣ing men, or from levity, fond of change, began to show a manifest dislike to the behaviour of the King, and the measures of the crown. They became jealous of foreigners. They complained of an expensive war, where victory itself could produce no advantage to Bri∣tain. They murmured against a standing army. They repined at the little use made of the navy, the great and natural bulwark of England.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Discon∣tents.</NOTE> Though the enemies of William exaggerated his mismanagements, it must be allowed, that men who judged of causes by events, had just reason to com∣plain. The expences of England, from the landing of the Prince of Orange, on the fith of November 1688, to the twenty-ninth of September 1691, had amounted to near eighteen millions<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">MS. 1691. Journals passim.</NOTE>. Besides, great arrears were owing to the army in Ireland, the navy was destitute of stores, and the ships were out of re∣pair. The service done in the intermediate time, ex∣clusive of the change made in the person of the Mo∣narch, was far from being adequate to that enormous sum. The war in Ireland had been at first strangely neglected. It was afterwards prosecuted with little judgment, and it terminated in no honour. The inha∣bitants of a few parishes in the Highlands of Scotland, without any aid from abroad, and destitute of the means of war at home, remained in arms against the King, for more than two years. They had once to∣tally defeated his army in the field. The checks which
<PB N="3" REF="14"/>
they had received, were neither splendid nor decisive; and he owed the pacification which ensued, to the in∣fluence of his rival, and his own money<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">MS. 1691.</NOTE>, and not to the terror of his power. England had been, in the mean time, wounded in her pride. Her fleet had been twice defeated. Her enemy rode in triumph in the channel. Her coasts were insulted. She was left naked of troops, and exposed to invasion<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">Nottingham to William, 1690.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Secret in∣trigues</NOTE> But William ought not, in common fairness, to be blamed for all these misfortunes. He reigned over a divided people. His title was disputed by one party. He lost the other, by not yielding to their claims upon his exclusive favour. His rival, in the mean time, supported by a powerful Monarch, either maintained war against him, within his kingdoms, or hovered over the coast, with threatened invasions. Deprived by his unhappy manner, and avowed attachment to foreigners, of the affection of the English, he had no friends among his servants. His councils were betray∣ed, his orders neglected, his person hated, his autho∣rity despised<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">Intell. from England. MS. 1691.</NOTE>. His only safety lay ultimately in the folly of his enemies; and that invincible aversion to the French nation, which the people of England had derived from their ancestors. James had scarce land∣ed in France, when many of those, by whose deser∣tion he had lost his throne, began secretly to favour his return. Men, who apparently had the chief hand in the revolution, admitted his agents into conferences, and encouraged their hopes<NOTE N="E" PLACE="foot">Rcresby.</NOTE>. The unprepared state of France, in the beginning of the year 1689, render∣ing an immediate invasion of England impracticable; James, contrary to his own opinion<NOTE N="F" PLACE="foot">Mem. to Lewis, MS. 1689.</NOTE>, was induced to sail to Ireland. He knew that it was impossible to hold that exhausted kingdom, against the wealth and power of the English nation. To render his rival uneasy in the possession of his throne, and to furnish France with an opportunity of aiding him with effect in England, was all that he expected from his expedi∣tion<NOTE N="G" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="15"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">with the Whigs.</NOTE> While James was on the worst terms with his fa∣vourite sect, the Catholics of Ireland, William, by the coldness of his manner, and his exertion of the prerogative, lost his influence with the Whigs in Eng∣land and Scotland. Discontented friends are frequent∣ly the most dangerous enemies. A plot was formed in Scotland, by the Presbyterians, in favour of James. Many of the Whigs in England were privy to a con∣spiracy, which threatened the subversion of their for∣mer principles. In both kingdoms, those inferior agents of the party, who had ruined the late King, were now busy in procuring his restoration. Sir John Cochran, Ferguson, Wildman engaged themselves deeply with James<NOTE N="H" PLACE="foot">Caermarthen to William, June 13, 1690.</NOTE> The leaders of the party, though they had not avowedly espoused the cause of that Prince, became very indifferent concerning the fate of William. The very secrets of the cabinet were said to have been betrayed, by the Earl of Mon∣mouth to Wildman; and by the latter to the late King<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot">Ma∣ry to William, 1690.</NOTE> The Duke of Bolton, the Marquis of Win∣chester, the Earl of Devonshire, the Lord Montague were suspected<NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">Caermarthen to William, 1690.</NOTE> The party in general made no se∣cret of their disappointment, in the Prince whom they had raised to the throne. Those who came over with him from Holland, and such as first joined him on his arrival, hated his person and his government the most<NOTE N="L" PLACE="foot">Dalrymple's Appen. Stuart-papers.</NOTE></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">James gains many friends.</NOTE> The retreat of James from Ireland, though unad∣vised, precipitate and weak, neither lessened his influ∣ence nor increased the interest of William. The To∣ries, urged by their principles, favoured the former. The Whigs, swayed by their resentment, still conti∣tinued adverse to the latter. The agents of James were, in the mean time, extremely active. The Co∣lonels Bulkely and Sackville sounded the Marquis of Halifax and the Lord Godolphin. The Earl of Marl∣borough, inflamed by recent injuries from William, and, perhaps, remembering his former obligations to James, began, as shall hereafter appear, to correspond
<PB N="5" REF="16"/>
with the latter. Admiral Russel, disappointed in his own private views, as well as in his public expectati∣ons from William, entered into the cabals, in favour of the late King. The Marquis of Caermarthen, in all his avowed zeal for the revolution, listened, in se∣cret to proposals for the restoration of James<NOTE N="M" PLACE="foot">Dalrymple's Appen. and MS. 1691.</NOTE>. While the great offered their service to the late King, that Prince neglected not to support his interest with conspiracies among the inferior ranks. He correspond∣ed with Ferguson. He informed him of his intentions. He asked his advice<NOTE N="N" PLACE="foot">Instruc∣tions to G. H. MS. 1691.</NOTE>. A party was formed in the city in his favour. The Tower was to have been sur∣prized. The guards were to be attacked, on the first news of his landing. The persons of William and Mary were to be seized<NOTE N="O" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their views</NOTE> The affairs of James wore a like favourable aspect in Scotland, toward the end of the preceding year. The cessation of arms made by Breadalbin with the Highlanders, had been begun and finished by his con∣sent. His firm friend the Earl of Arran had promised <Q REND="inline">"body for body,"</Q> to use his own expression, for the Earl of Argyle and the Marquis of Athol. The High∣landers were again prepared to take the field. Ten thousand men, under the Duke of Berwick and the Earl of Dumbarton, were to have been sent to Scot∣land. The Marquis of Athol, the Earls of Argyle and Home, were to have received commissions, as lieute∣nant-generals, from James. The intrigues of James extended, in England, to the projected measures of parliament, and even to the very appointment of Wil∣liam's servants. The delay, at first, in granting the supply, the facility with which it was afterwards ob∣tained, proceeded from the secret machinations of the late King's friends. Some of them wished to leave the kingdom naked to an invasion, by refusing money. Others to vote the excise, that their old master might enjoy the benefit, without the odium, of that unpo∣pular tax. Under the mask of patriotism, they propos∣ed to attack his enemies. The Bishops of Salisbury
<PB N="6" REF="17"/>
and St. Asaph were to be impeached, for persuading the clergy to take the oaths to William, as a conqueror. The Marquis of Caermarthen, though he might not obstruct a restoration, was not, from his temporizing character, to be trusted. He was, therefore, to be terrified from office by an impeachment, for declaring that no King could reign in England, as long as the act of <HI>habeas corpus</HI> should remain in force. The choice of his successor, as minister, was left to James; and the contest, for preference, lay between the Mar∣quis of Halifax and the Earl of Rochester<NOTE N="P" PLACE="foot">Ferguson's Memorial, MS. Oct. 1691.</NOTE>. To keep alive the spirit of discontent in the kingdom, Fer∣guson employed, for King James, that very private press, with which he had, some years before, so much annoyed the Duke of York<NOTE N="Q" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Correspon∣dence of Marlbo∣rough and Russel.</NOTE> Though the Whigs, by their leaders, and the most of the Tories, in their own names, had made engage∣ments with the late King, he relied chiefly upon Marl∣borough and Russel. Marlborough had asked, in the most abject terms, and obtained forgiveness for his for∣mer conduct, from James and his Queen<NOTE N="R" PLACE="foot">Jan. 10th, 1691.</NOTE>. He even became an agent for that Prince. He gained the Earl of Shrewsbury. He tampered with Caermarthen. He promised to bring back the Princess of Denmark to her duty to her father<NOTE N="S" PLACE="foot">May 20th, 1691.</NOTE>. He undertook, in some degree, for the army. He requested James to invade England, with twenty thousand men. Though he was not trusted by James, he was, perhaps, sincere in his professions, and he effected what he promised. The Princess of Denmark, gained by his solicitations, warm∣ed with a returning affection for her father, or urged by resentment for personal injuries received from Wil∣liam and her sister, made her peace with the late King. She wrote to him a letter full of contrition<NOTE N="T" PLACE="foot">Dec. 10th, 1691.</NOTE>. She asked his forgiveness, and promised to join him whenever he should land in England<NOTE N="U" PLACE="foot">Dec. 1691.</NOTE>. Marl∣borough, judging it vain to corrupt the captains of men of war, as they durst not communicate the secret to the sailors, was the person who advised James to
<PB N="7" REF="18"/>
accept of the services of Russel<NOTE N="V" PLACE="foot">Marlborough's Message, MS. 1694. James II. 1692.</NOTE>. To avoid an ac∣tion with the French fleet, should they fall in his way, would have been impossible. But it always was in the admiral's power to carry the fleet from the course held by the enemy, under the specious pretence of orders. The conspiracy was so great and general, that William seemed to have no friend to apprize him of his dan∣ger. Though he dismissed the earl of Marlborough from all his employments, in the month of January, though he disgraced and deprived of her guards the Princess of Denmark, his resentment seems to have rather proceeded from a renewal of private quarrels, than from any discovery of their secret negociations with the court of St. Germains.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Intrigues of James in England.</NOTE> James himself had taken all the precautions, which prudence or the advice of his friends could suggest, to render his return agreeable to the nation. He endea∣voured to awaken the feelings of his former subjects, with a detail of the injustice of his rival and his own misfortunes. He hoped to rouze their resentment, by representing, in a strong light their grievances. He dwelt, in his proposed declaration, on the tyranny of foreigners. He reminded the people of the enormous expences of government, the weight of taxes, the pro∣fusion of William, his glaring partiality to his country∣men the Dutch. He yielded to all the requisitions of the Whigs in favour of the subject. He satisfied the church of England, with regard to religion. The non∣jurors were his determined friends. The clergy who had taken the oaths offered to return to their allegiance, and they were, with chearfulness, received. To satis∣fy the world that the Protestant religion was in no dan∣ger, five hundred clergymen had engaged to join the late King upon his landing; and to attend him in his progress to preach to the people. The deprived bishops, the most of those prelates, who had temporized with William, by taking the oaths, were busy in inculcat∣ing, upon the inferior clergy, the propriety of restor∣ing
<PB N="8" REF="19"/>
James; while they, at the same time, assured that Prince of their zeal and fidelity<NOTE N="W" PLACE="foot">Stuart papers, 1693.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Project of an invasion.</NOTE> Encouraged by favourable accounts from Britain, and eager to turn the scale of the war, by placing that kingdom in the hands of a friend, Lewis the Four∣teenth began to think seriously of an invasion. James possessed of his native subjects an army almost equal to the purpose of the expedition. The transports which had carried to Ireland five thousand French, in the year 1690, had brought back to France as many Irish. The English government had been at the expence of sending fourteen thousand more troops to James, after the capitulation of Limeric. Lewis promised to trans∣port to Britain ten thousand of this army, with a like number of French troops, under the convoy of his whole fleet, early in the year 1692. He began, in the month of January, to equip squadrons of men of war, at Toulon, Brest, Rochfort, and Port-Lewis. An embargo was laid upon all merchantmen. All pri∣vateers were recalled to man the fleet. An army, un∣der the Mareschal de Bellefons, filed off toward the coast of Normandy. Transports were prepared. James had concerted his measures with his friends in England. He had settled his concessions to the nation. To se∣cure the Earl of Marlborough, already in disgrace, from the further resentment of William, he agreed, at his own request, to except that nobleman from par∣don, in his projected declaration to his people<NOTE N="X" PLACE="foot">Stuart papers, 1692. Dalrymple's Append.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Preparati∣ons of Wil∣liam.</NOTE> Though so many persons were privy to the de∣signs of James, though every channel of intelligence brought news of the preparations of France, William was still a stranger to his own danger. He, however, made all necessary preparations for manning the fleet. Press-warrants continued to be executed, throughout the month of February. All sailors fit for service, were forced to enter on board the navy. The utmost expedition was used in the docks and yards. In the first week of March, all the ships of force had come round from Portsmouth. Many had fallen down from
<PB N="9" REF="20"/>
Deptford, Woolwich, and Chatham, to the Nore. William, upon his arrival in Holland, hastened the Dutch fleet to sea. The Amsterdam, the Maese, the North-Holland, the Zealand squadrons were ordered to proceed successively to the Downs. The combined fleets formed a greater naval force than had ever covered the sea. They consisted of ninety ships of the line, with many frigates and fire-ships. They carried more than forty thousand men, with near six thousand guns. Russel, in the Britannia, a first rate, command∣ed in chief the whole. He resolved to adhere to his engagements with James. But time and accident broke through all his designs<NOTE N="Y" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1692.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">James ar∣rives at La Hogue.</NOTE> The late King had concerted with his friends in England, that the French fleet should sail early in the year. Had the preparations of Lewis answered his ex∣pectations, he proposed to put to sea in the middle of March. He, however, left not St. Germains until the eleventh of April. He had, even then, sufficient time to carry his army to England, before the junction of Russel with the Dutch-fleet. Besides that officer continued his correspondence, and assured him of his firm intention to serve his cause. He proposed one of two alternatives. That James should suspend his ex∣pedition till winter; or that he himself should, under the pretence of making a descent on the coast of France, permit the French fleet to pass. He accordingly ap∣plied, but in vain, to the court of England, for per∣mission to attack St. Maloes. He advised James, by all means, to prevent the meeting of the fleets. None of his officers was trusted with the secret; and he would, therefore, find himself under a necessity to fight. A contrary wind, which blew incessantly for four weeks, hindered the French from sailing, and prevented James from conveying his instructions to Russel. The Toulon squadron was kept, by the same adverse wind, from passing the Streights. Tourville, with the Brest squadron, was, after repeated efforts, driven back to his port. During this interval, the Dutch joined the English in the Downs<NOTE N="Z" PLACE="foot">May 8.</NOTE>. Russel proceeded immediately to St. Helens, and ordered
<PB N="10" REF="21"/>
two small squadrons, that cruized on the coast of France, to join him in that place.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vigorous measures in England.</NOTE> During this time of suspence, the government of England were not remiss in their duty. Several of the servants of the crown were in correspondence with the late King. But they endeavoured, by a shew of ala∣crity against him, to prevent every suspicion of infide∣lity. Some imperfect insinuations of a plot had been carried to William in Flanders. The Earl of Port∣land arrived, with secret instructions for the Queen. The Earls of Huntington and Marlborough were sent to the Tower, with others of lesser name. A procla∣mation was issued, for apprehending several other per∣sons of rank, who had absconded. A camp was form∣ed between Petersfield and Portsmouth. Six regi∣ments, under orders to embark for Flanders, were countermanded. The lieutenancy were commanded to raise the militia. The same precautions were used in Scotland. But Ireland was left to its fate. Orders were sent to the fleet to sail in quest of the enemy. A declaration, issued by James before he left St. Ger∣mains, was published and answered, by authority. Activity and spirit prevailed every where; and that terror, which commonly precedes danger, was lessen∣ed by the bustle of preparation<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Gazettes, 1692.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The fleet sails toward La Hogue.</NOTE> The communication between France and England was, in the mean time, completely interrupted. James, during all the time he had remained at La Hogue, received no intelligence from his friends in London<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">James II. 1692.</NOTE>. Captain Lloyd, who had been dispatched to him by his adherents, with an important message, and a letter from the princess of Denmark, was detained two months on his way. Tourville, upon a change of wind, sailed at length from Brest, with forty-four ships of the line. He directed his course to La Hogue. Un∣fortunately for that admiral, the combined fleet of the enemy, consisting of many more than double his num∣ber of ships, arrived, at the same instant, in the neigh∣bourhood of that place. The weather, in the mean time, was extremely hazy. On the nineteenth of May, about four of the clock in the morning, the sun
<PB N="11" REF="22"/>
having cleared a little the weather, admiral Russel des∣cried the enemy holding, with a very small gale at west and by south, their course southward, on the same tack with himself. They began on both sides to form the line. Tourville, who had been irritated by a re∣flection thrown on his courage, by de Seignelay, re∣solved to fight the enemy, though he was not ignorant of their force. He bore down upon the combined fleets at ten of the clock. The Dutch were in the van. The French admiral threw out the signal of battle, as he advanced on Russel, who lay to receive him, with his fore top-sail to the mast<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">Russel's Letter to Nottingham, June 2, 1692.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An engage∣ment.</NOTE> At half an hour after eleven, Tourville, in the Roy∣al Sun, of one hundred and four guns, brought to, within three quarters of a musket shot, of the Britan∣nia of one hundred guns, commanded by Russel. The rest of the French admiral's division fell in with the English line. A smart engagement ensued. The two commanders plied their guns very warmly, till one of the clock. The weather, during the engagement, fell almost calm. Tourville was disabled. His rigging, sails, and yards were shot. His fire began to slacken. He ordered his boats to tow him to windward. Five fresh ships of the squadron, with a furious fire, cover∣ed their admiral's retreat. About four of the clock, a thick fog fell on the battle; and the firing ceased. At half after five, a small breeze of wind arose at East. The weather cleared up a little. The French were running on every side. Russel gave the signal for the fleet to chase. The fog returned and night came on. The French stood to the West, with all their sails. The breeze was so light that little way could be made. The fog continued the greatest part of the next day. Toward the evening, Russel took in the signal for the line of battle; and ordered each ship to make the best of her way, in pursuit of the enemy. The tide of ebb being done, both fleets came to an anchor; both resolving to take advantage of the next return of the tide<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="23"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sixteen French ships burnt.</NOTE> In the morning of the twenty first of May, all the French ships were far advanced toward the Race of Alderney. One and twenty however were driven eastward, from the entrance of the Race, by the tide of flood, toward Cape La Hogue. Three of that number endeavoured to tack to the westward, against the current. But one of them, after two or three short boards ran ashore. The other two were wea∣thered by the sternmost ships of Russel's squadron. Sir Ralph Delaval, rear admiral of the red, was or∣dered to destroy the three ships. Russel himself stretch∣ed after the remaining eighteen, who hauled in for La Hogue. Five made their escape eastward, in the night. Thirteen were observed, on the twenty-second, hauled in close with the shore. On the twenty-third, rear-admiral Rooke was ordered, with several men of war, the fire-ships and boats of the fleet, to destroy the enemy's ships. The men of war could not ap∣proach. He, however, burnt six ships in the night. The remaining seven were destroyed in the same man∣ner, the next day. Little resistance was made by the French. Their officers had retired, and the men fled, upon the approach of the English sailors. James him∣self is said to have been a spectator of this last action, but Tourville refused to receive his advice. The ar∣my intended for the invasion were near; but they had the mortification to behold a destruction which they could not prevent<NOTE N="E" PLACE="foot">Russel's letter to Nottingham, June 2, 1692.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Observati∣ons</NOTE> The French owed their misfortunes in the battle, or rather in the affair of La Hogue, as it has been more justly called, to their presumption, at first, and after∣wards to their want of spirit and skill. Tourville sup∣ported with little courage and less conduct, the battle into which he had wantonly entered. The superior skill of the English, in managing light breezes of wind and impetuous tides, gave them a great advan∣tage over an enemy, who were manifestly conquered in their own minds. The French suffered little in the engagement. Tourville's ship was the only one in any degree disabled. None was taken, none sunk, few even suffered in their rigging. Russel himself, 
<PB N="13" REF="24"/>
though a man of too much courage not to fight with spirit, owed his success more to accident and the folly of his enemies, than his own conduct. Had the Dutch shewed the same alacrity in fighting, which they had exhibited upon a former occasion against Tourville, the ruin of the French fleet might have been render∣ed complete. But the haziness of the weather; the very fears of the French, upon perceiving themselves much outnumbered; the consusion and want of plan which prevail in all naval engagements, ought to have saved the victors from the censure which some writers have thrown on their conduct. The chief loss of the French consisted in that of their ships. Sixteen men of war, between fifty-six and one hundred and four guns, were burnt. Twenty transports shared the same fate. Few were killed on either side. Among the slain, on the part of the victors, the most re∣gretted were admiral Carter and captain Hastings<NOTE N="F" PLACE="foot">Gazette.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">on the affair of La Hogue.</NOTE> Russel, it is certain, meant nothing less than to ob∣struct the service for which the French fleet were to sail. His loitering at St. Helens, for ten days after he had passed through the Downs; his applying, in con∣cert with the late King, to the ministry for leave to attack St. Maloes; his calling in the squadrons that observed under Carter and Delaval the motions of the enemy; seem all to have been calculated to accom∣modate the intended invasion. He knew that the same winds which carried himself out of the river, would have favoured Tourville, in leaving Brest. A few days would have brought the French fleet to La Hogue. A few hours would have wafted the invaders to the coast of Sussex. When James should land, he was determined to throw off the mask and declare for that Prince. The prudence, or perhaps, the terrors of the government defeated his measures. They re∣fused to agree to the proposed descent, They ordered him to take the advice of a council of war. The re∣sult was, that the fleet stretched over to La Hogue. But with a design to return to St. Helen's in four days. The fate of the British kingdoms depended upon ac∣cident.

Had Tourville arrived on the coast of Nor∣mandy a few days before, or had the winds detained him till Russel's proposed return to his old station, the crown of England would have been transferred to the late King, without contest<NOTE N="H" PLACE="foot">Stuart papers.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Conduct of James. Transacti∣ons at sea.</NOTE> James was rather disappointed than rendered despe∣rate, by the success of the English fleet. He laid the blame upon accident. He continued his correspon∣dence with Russel. He held his former communica∣tion with his friends in England. Though the object of his restoration was rendered a little more distant, he kept it still in view. His agents were busy. The discontented caballed in his favour. Men in office be∣trayed to him the secrets of the cabinet; and some∣times, guided their conduct by his advice<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1692. James II.</NOTE>. He retired to St. Germans, where his queen had borne a daughter in his absence. The English fleet remained in a state of inaction, during the rest of the summer. The ministry proposed to carry into execution a de∣scent on the French coast, which had been projected in the preceding winter. Russel, discontented with government, and provoked by some orders sent to him by the queen, which he deemed the the effect of ig∣norance<NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. iii.</NOTE>, rendered ineffectual a scheme which promised no great success. The French fleet retired to their ports. They had lost but a very few men in their late misfortune. They filled the whole channel with their privateers. The merchants sustained much loss. The great expectations which the nation de∣rived from the late victory, were damped with its want of beneficial consequences. The ministry com∣plained of Russel, and Russel of the ministry.

the life and spirit of their councils and armies. The force of the allies had however been, in some degree, diminished, by the intrigues of Lewis the Fourteenth, and misunderstandings between themselves. Disputes between the Emperor and the Elector of Saxony, had induced the latter to recal his troops to his own domi∣nions. Sweden and Denmark continued their neutra∣lity. The Helvetic body discovered an inclination to favour the cause of France. To supply the place of the Saxons, the Emperor and King of England gained the younger branch of the house of Lunenburgh to their party. The Dukes of Zell and Hanover, upon the promise of an electoral cap, with a certainty of the investiture before the end of the year, undertook to march six thousand troops to join the Imperialists, and four thousand to reinforce the army of the allies in Flanders. The Spaniards had raised to the govern∣ment of that country, the Elector of Bavaria; a Prince whose spirit and abilities promised to support the feebleness of the common cause, on that side. France was, in the mean time, active in her prepara∣tions, and prudent in the disposition of her armies. The Mareschal de Lorges commanded on the upper Rhine. De Joyeuse occupied the country of Eye∣feldt. De Boufflers lay between the Sambre and the Meuse.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Namur taken.</NOTE> Lewis the Fourteenth and William set out, on the same day, to join their respective armies. The first arrived in his camp, on the twentieth of May. On the twenty-third, all his troops were in motion. He suddenly sat down before Namur. The King with forty-five thousand men, prosecuted the siege. He was covered by Luxembourg, with another army. The town was strong. The citadel was deemed im∣pregnable. The Prince de Barbason commanded in the place, with a well-appointed garrison of ten thou∣sand men. The famous Coehorn defended, in person, a new fort called by his own name. But de Vauban
<PB N="16" REF="27"/>
directed the attack. The eyes of all Europe were turned toward Namur. Two great Kings, at the head of two powerful armies, turned their whole thoughts to this important enterprise. A battle, which was to decide the fate of the war, was daily to be ex∣pected. The French attacked<NOTE N="N" PLACE="foot">June 29. N. S.</NOTE> the place with incredible vigour. The town, in six days, was forced to capitulate<NOTE N="O" PLACE="foot">July 5.</NOTE>. William, in the mean time, ad∣vanced, with an army of one hundred thousand men, and sat down within cannon shot of Luxembourg's lines. The small river Mehaigne ran between the ar∣mies. An ineffectual cannonade ensued. The French pressed with vigour the siege of the new fort. Coe∣horn made an obstinate defence. But being driven from the covered way, on the twenty-second of July, and forced to retire with great loss into the body of the place, he capitulated. The fate of the citadel was soon after decided. The garrison evacuated the place, on the thirtieth of July; and Lewis returned in triumph to Versailles<NOTE N="P" PLACE="foot">Hist. de France, tom. iii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Steinkirk.</NOTE> Though William lost reputation, by permitting a place of such importance as Namur to be taken in his sight, his inactivity may be justified, in some degree, by the strong position of the enemy. The Duke de Luxembourg, one of the best generals of the age, had posted himself to great advantage, on the banks of the Mehaigne. The unseasonable rains had unexpectedly swelled the stream, and formed into morasses the ad∣joining fields. To make, at first, an attack, was to risque a defeat; and the place surrendered before Wil∣liam, who was always slow in his councils, could de∣termine upon any vigorous measure to raise the siege. To retrieve the glory which he had lost before Namur, William endeavoured to suprise the French army un∣der the Duke of Luxembourg at Steinkirk. The attack was chiefly carried on by the English in co∣lumns. They ascended with amazing resolution and spirit the rising ground, on which a wing of the French army lay encamped. They took possession of their
<PB N="17" REF="28"/>
batteries, and were, for some time, masters of their line. The whole camp was in confusion. But the assailants were not properly supported. The second line of the French advanced. The rencounter was ob∣stinate and bloody. The contest was maintained for four hours. The allies were at length repulsed, hav∣ing left many thousands of the enemy, as well as of their own number, dead on the field. Though this bloody battle was attended with no material conse∣quences, an undisputed victory remained to the French. The king gained no reputation for his con∣duct. But the valour of his troops deserved great ap∣plause. The generals Mackay, Lanier, and Douglas, the Earl of Angus and several officers of distinction were killed in this unfortunate field. The Prince de Turenne and the Mareschal de Bellefons were numbered among the slain, on the side of the French<NOTE N="Q" PLACE="foot">Hist. de France, tom. iii. Gazettes, passim.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A conspira∣cy against William.</NOTE> The campaign in Flanders languished after the bat∣tle of Steinkirk. The discovery of a plot against the life of William, and the execution of one Grandval, the pretended assassin, gave occasion to much reflection and noise. Lewis the Fourteenth and the late King of England were involved by the discoverers in this conspiracy. But as there is no probability that the former would be guilty of such a villainous design; so there is now a certainty, that the latter rejected, al∣ways, with becoming horror, all proposals of the like kind. The incident, however, served, at the time, the views of party; and loaded, with a degree of infa∣my, an unhappy Prince, already ruined by his folly and misfortunes. The hopes of a reward for the dis∣covery, gave birth, in all appearance, to a plot laid chiefly at the door of de Louvois, who was lately dead. His son, de Barbesieux, was accused of carry∣ing on what his father had begun. But as the odium of the murder itself would do more harm, than what could be derived of advantage from the death of Wil∣liam, the prudence of the French court may be trust∣ed with regard to their innocence.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Campaign in Savoy, on the Rhine, and in Hun∣gary.</NOTE> The French, in exerting their chief force in Flan∣ders, left their own country exposed, on the side of Dauphiné. The army under de Catinat was found too weak to resist the Duke of Savoy. That Prince sufficiently revenged himself for the insults which he had received in his own dominions, in the two preced∣ing campaigns. He entered Dauphiné, in the month of July. He ravaged the open country. He attack∣ed the fortified towns. The surrender of Embrun, on the seventeenth of August, was soon followed by the taking of Gap. In the midst of his success, the Duke fell ill of the small-pox. Dissentions prevailed among the nations which composed his motley army. He found himself obliged to retire, and to evacuate the places which he had seized. On the Rhine, the Mareschal de Lorges defeated the Prince of Wertem∣berg, on the seventeenth of September. He forced the Prince of Hesse to raise the siege of Ebenbourg. The Marquis d' Harcourt obtained some advantages in the county of Chinei; and de Boufflers bombarded Charleroy, on the nineteenth of October. The cam∣paign, upon the whole, ended with sufficient glory to France. Her allies were not equally successful, on their side of the war. Great Waradin was taken by the Imperialists, after a long blockade; and those dis∣tractions, which usually attend the misfortunes of the Ottomans, involved the Seraglio in blood<NOTE N="R" PLACE="foot">Hist. de France, tom. iii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Young's forgeries.</NOTE> The defeat of the French fleet at La Hogue had removed the fears of the nation from a foreign ene∣my; but the domestic tranquillity was still disturbed, by surmizes of plots, conspiracies, and treasons. Men in general believed, that some secret machinations ex∣isted, in favour of the late King. No proofs had ap∣peared against the suspected. The Earls of Hunting∣ton, Scarsdale, and Marlborough, had been sent to the Tower, upon the accusation of one Young; a criminal, actually under the execution of the law, in Newgate, for forgery. This infamous person, by the advice of a prisoner for debt, in the same gaol, and by the aid of one Blackhead, framed an associa∣tion

against the government; to which he annexed the names of the Earls of Salisbury and Marlborough, the deprived Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishop of Rochester, and other persons of rank. The Bishop of Rochester being confronted with Blackhead, de∣tected the villainy of the accusation, to the satisfaction of the council. But the court, suspecting Marlbo∣rough of some secret intrigues with James, still encou∣raged Young. His fine was paid, and he himself was discharged from prison. Marlborough, in defiance of the <HI>habeas corpus</HI> act, was detained in the Tower, by a chichane of law, even after the grand jury of Mid∣dlesex had found a bill of forgery, and subornation of perjury, against Young<NOTE N="S" PLACE="foot">Case of the Earls of Huntington and Marlborough.</NOTE>.</P>

The passions of men, in∣flamed by faction and party were ready to receive im∣pressions of the worst kind. The press groaned with polemical pamphlets. The Jacobites attacked the measures of government, and accused the King of a breach of faith to the nation. The Whigs complain∣ed of the management of the war, the burden of taxes, the imperfect securities of the liberties of the people. They affirmed, that the aid given for the maintenance of the war at land had been absolutely lost. That, instead of breaking the power of France, the efforts of the allies had covered her arms with re∣nown. The grand army, under the King in Flanders, they said, had lost ground to the enemy. The Ger∣mans had received a check, on the Rhine. The ef∣forts of the Spaniards in Catalonia had been seeble and ineffectual. The retreat of the Duke of Savoy had put an end to the hopes of the allies, on that side. The navy, though successful against the fleet of the enemy, had not been able to protect the commerce of the kingdom against their privateers. These suggesti∣ons were received with avidity, by a people accustom∣ed to blame the measures of every government. The facts, though exaggerated, were true in the main;

Having arrived from Brussels at the Hague, on the eleventh of October, he embarked, on the fifteenth, in the Maese; and on the twentieth came to Kensington. He met his parliament at West∣minster, on the fourth of November. He expressed to them his joy, at having an opportunity of thank∣ing them again for their large supplies. He hoped, he said, for their future advice and assistance against the excessive power of France. They had great rea∣son to rejoice, he said, at the late victory at sea. He wished that he could tell them of an equal success by land. He informed them, that the French were re∣pairing the loss, which they had sustained in their fleet. That they designed to augment their army against the next campaign. He, therefore, declared, that it was absolutely necessary that, at least, an equal force should be maintained in the ensuing, as in the present year; and he desired the commons to give a suitable supply. He was sensible, he said, of the hea∣vy charge upon his people. He regretted the incon∣venience of sending great sums of money out of the kingdom, for the payment of troops abroad. He promised to attempt a descent on France. He took notice of the signal deliverance from the French inva∣sion. He entertained no doubt of their support. He requested dispatch in their councils. He assured them, that he had no interest separate from theirs. That he had no aim, but to render his people happy.

The lords, who had been com∣mitted to the Tower, represented their grievances. They were supported, with great warmth by their friends. The constable of the Tower was ordered to produce the warrants of commitment. The judges of the king's bench were commanded to appear before the house, to answer for their refusal to discharge the recognizance, into which the imprisoned peers had en∣tered for their appearance. Violent debates ensued. The opposition, in every motion prevailed. Resolu∣tions were framed to guide the judges of oyer and ter∣miner, in their proceedings on the <HI>habeas corpus</HI> act. The lords declared, that two witnesses of the delin∣quency were necessary to justify the remanding any person to prison, upon his application to be admitted to bail. A motion was made and carried, for enter∣ing this resolution on the books, as a standing rule to all future judges. The mode of setting free the accused prisoners became a matter of great debate. The King interfered. To end the contest, he promised to give directions for discharging the bail of the lords, in the king's bench.

But they, at the same time, resolved to present an address, desiring that the allian∣ces made with the Sates, in the months of April and August 1689, and all other alliances with the princes and States of Europe, should be laid before the house<NOTE N="W" PLACE="foot">Nov. 10.</NOTE>. They entered into an examination of the management of the war at sea. They voted thanks to Admiral Russel for his victory. But they resolved to inquire, why that victory had not been pursued.

This, however, was soon after dropt. A resolution to offer advice to the King, was attended with no bet∣ter fate. A great animosity against the preference given to foreigners exhibited itself in the debates of the house. They resolved, that one article of the propos∣ed advice should bear, that he should fill all vacancies, as they should happen among the general officers, with the subjects of Great Britain; and that the commander in chief of the English troops should be an Englishman.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">The lords refractory.</NOTE> THE lords were much more refractory than the commons. The former seemed offended with the King, as well as with his measures. The latter shew∣ed only their dislike to the acting minister, the Earl of Nottingham. The discontented lords availed them∣selves of the article in the speech, where William ask∣ed advice of his parliament. Under this cover, they endeavoured to send a remonstrance to the throne. Those who had distinguished themselves most for the revolution, were the chief promoters of a measure, which distressed and offended the King. The Earl of Devonshire, though lord-steward of the household, preferred his principles to the adherence to the court, expected from his office. The Earls of Shrewsbury, Monmouth, Torrington, Macclesfield, and Warring∣ton, and the Lord Mountague, who were deemed the most steady Whigs, were the most violent against William and his partiality to strangers. The Earl of Marlborough, yielding to his own resentment, and in concert with James<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, Nov. 1692.</NOTE>, appeared a principal in the motions against foreigners. The Earl of Bath, who had four years before, betrayed Plymouth to the Prince of Orange, had engaged to execute the same service for the late King<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. To give an earnest of his zeal, he joined heartily with Marlborough. The Tory lords, not in office, supported the opposition on popu∣lar grounds. Though the majority of the bishops fa∣voured James in secret, they adhered, except one, to the court; and several peers who were in corres∣pondence with the court of St. Germains<NOTE N="E" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>, endea∣voured to cover their private engagements, by sup∣porting, in public, the cause of William.</P>

A remonstrance was presented<NOTE N="F" PLACE="foot">Journals, Feb. 25, 1693.</NOTE> to the King, consisting of five articles. The peers desired, that the com∣manding officer of the English, next the King himself, should be an Englishman. That the English officers should have precedency of all officers of the same rank in the confederate armies, except those of crowned heads. That the twenty thousand men, destined for the defence of England, should be all native English, under the command of an English general. That the abuses committed in pressing sailors should be remedied and prevented. That no foreigners should be permit∣ted to sit at the board of ordnance. William was not of a complexion to grant demands, so contrary to his fixed predilections and views. He refused the request of the lords, by answering, that he would consider their address. The opposition had carried their point with such difficulty, that they dropt the remonstrance, without any farther efforts. Their ill humour, how∣ever, continued; and filled the whole session with inef∣fectual altercations and debates<NOTE N="G" PLACE="foot">Journals.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceedings of both houses.</NOTE> The opposition in the house of lords, to shew their own resentment, or to embarrass the government, dis∣covered a disposition to stop the progress of the bills of supply. The measure was adopted in concert with James<NOTE N="H" PLACE="foot">Stu∣art-papers, 1692.</NOTE>, who notwithstanding his disappointment at La Hogue, still projected an invasion. The Mar∣quis of Halifax and the Earl of Mulgrave induced the house, by the force of their eloquence, to ingraft a clause on the land-tax bill, that the lords should tax themselves. The bill was sent down amended to the commons. The lower house flew into the most vio∣lent heat. They rejected the amendment, without one dissenting voice. The lords agreed to pass the bill, without alteration, with a formal protest, on their journals, that though they yielded to the present urgent state of affairs, they had a right to insist upon
<PB N="25" REF="38"/>
taxing themselves. In other matters, the two houses were more unanimous. They ordered, by a joint vote, that a pamphlet, entitled, <Q REND="inline">"King William and Mary conquerors,"</Q> should be burnt by the hands of the common hangman. They addressed the King to dismiss from his place the licenser of the press, under whose sanction it had been printed and published. They assumed an appearance of hostility to the high prerogatives of the crown, while they strengthened the hands of the King with enormous supplies<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot">Journals, passim.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A place-bill rejected by the lords.</NOTE> Though this facility in giving money, has been ascribed to some corrupt practices of the court, it may be justified from the urgent state of the times. The people were plunged in a war, from which they could not immediately extricate themselves, by land, either with honour or with safety. To remit in preparations by sea, might have encouraged an invasion. The commons, in other respects, shewed little complai∣sance for the crown. They even appeared to be self-denied, with regard to the private interest of their own members. They introduced and passed a bill, touching free and impartial proceedings in parliament, which excluded, from the right of sitting in the house, all persons, who should accept of any office from the crown. The ministry found themselves incapable of opposing, in the lower house, a measure so popular. To facilitate the passing of this important bill, it was not to be in force till the King should think fit to call a new parliament. It was sent up to the lords early in the session. The malcontents, in the upper house, carried the motion in favour of the bill, in the com∣mittee. But when it came to be reported, the court party, by the means of proxies, rejected it, by a majority of two votes. The adherents of James were joined with the most violent Whigs, upon the present occasion. The first wished for confusion; the latter, by yielding to their resentment, adhered to their pro∣fessed principles<NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">Journals.</NOTE>.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bill for shortening the durati∣on of par∣liament re∣jected by the King.</NOTE> they could not exclude the members from office, they were resolved to shorten the duration of parliament. The present house of commons, though refractory on some occasions, had rendered their general conduct grateful to the court. Their opposition to the high exertions of the prerogative had never been followed with rigour. They were generous in their supplies, and, perhaps, rather profuse, with regard to the mo∣ney of the subject. A great majority were Tories, men in general less attached to the family of a prince, than to the power of the crown. The Earl of Not∣tingham and others of their own party had opened a channel of connexion between them and the reigning King. Sir John Trevor, the speaker, was a success∣ful agent, in purchasing the votes of the venal, with money<NOTE N="L" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. iii.</NOTE>. Besides, in the present divided state of the nation, a new election would be at least trouble∣some, if not attended with danger. The opposition perceived the views of their enemies, and they were resolved to pursue their own. The Earl of Shrews∣bury moved for a bill, providing for triennial parlia∣ments and annual sessions. It passed the house of lords. The commons passed it by a great majority. William resolved to disappoint a bill, so adverse to the power of the crown. He therefore rejected it, when presented for the royal assent<NOTE N="M" PLACE="foot">March 14.</NOTE>. This was the second time he made use of a prerogative, which neither of his immediate predecessors ever chose to exert.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of Ireland.</NOTE> The affairs of Ireland commanded a considerable de∣gree of the attention of parliament during the present session. That kingdom, ever since its reduction in 1691, had exhibited one continued scene of oppression, injustice, and public misery. The government of James, with all its disadvantages, his own bigotry, the insolence of the papists, combined with the fears of the protestants, were all more tolerable than the adminis∣tration of William, ever since the surrender of Lime∣rick. Coningsby and Porter, the lords justices, ren∣dered themselves odious by a series of frauds, cruelties,
<PB N="27" REF="40"/>
and rapacities. They sold common justice for money. They screened the guilty and oppressed the innocent, for gain. To render their proceedings summary, to clothe their authority with more terror, and, with most expedition, to enrich themselves, they chose to exert their power in the military way. The corruption, at the source, extended itself through every channel of government. The subordinate magistrates, the justices of the peace, as if all law were at an end, made their own will and pleasure the rule of their conduct. Pre∣suming on their power in the country, they deprived, under the colour of authority, many persons of their effects; they dispossessed many of their lands<NOTE N="N" PLACE="foot">Printed Proclamation.</NOTE>. The Roman Catholics, as they had less to expect from justice than the Protestants, endeavoured to purchase favour. They applied to those in power, through the channel of venality; and thus the party who had been in arms against the Revolution, fared better than those who had supported the cause of William with the most zeal, courage, and industry<NOTE N="O" PLACE="foot">Journals, passim, 1693.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The grie∣vances of that king∣dom</NOTE> On the third of March 1692, the Lord Viscount Sidney was raised to the government of Ireland. But he arrived not in that kingdom, till the twenty-fifth of the following August. Coningsby, created a Baron by the same name, with his colleague Porter, conti∣nued in the government, in the intermediate time. They presided in the court of claims, for adjusting the demands of those comprehended in the articles of Limerick; and the obvious road to their justice, was said to lie through their avarice. The arrival of Sid∣ney in his government, though it might lessen the fear of future oppressions, diminished not the resentment of the people for former injuries. His own conduct seem∣ed more calculated to preserve the prerogative of the crown, than to redress the grievances of the subject. His speech, at the opening of the parliament, was suited to the times, and well received. But the me∣mory of the past, created an ill humour among the commons. Seventy thousand pounds had been de∣manded, as an additional revenue, for the annual and
<PB N="28" REF="41"/>
necessary expences of government. But the house were either slow in finding the ways and means, or ignorant where they could be found. Two bills, rea∣dy drawn, the one for an additional excise on malt liquors, the other for a tax on land bearing corn, were sent down from the Irish privy council. The com∣mons were highly offended at the manner of introduc∣ing these bills, which were in themselves, especially the latter, highly exceptionable; and in some degree, partial and unjust. They argued, that though, by Poyning's law, no bill was to be passed, without the sanction of the English privy council, it was never deemed that the Irish commons were precluded from taxing themselves<NOTE N="P" PLACE="foot">Journals, passion. Slone's Narrative.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">laid before the English parliament.</NOTE> The necessities of government induced the lord-lieu∣tenant to hearken to a compromise. The commons consented to pass the excise bill, with a declaration, that the thing should not be drawn into a precedent. But they rejected the land-bill, as laying an unequal tax upon the farmers. When Sidney found himself in possession of the additional excise, he gave vent to his resentment against the parliament. He sent for them, on the fourth of November<NOTE N="Q" PLACE="foot">1692.</NOTE>. He re∣primanded them severely, for invading the preroga∣tives of the Crown. He prorogued them to the six∣teenth of April. Inflamed with what they deemed a public insult, offended at some private expressions of indignation from the lord-lieutenant, several members of the Irish house of commons came, in the name of their country, to England, to lay their grievances be∣fore the parliament. On the twenty-fourth of Fe∣bruary, they laid their complaints, in writing, before the English commons. The lords, at the same time, took cognizance of the affair, and examined witnesses. Some circumstances appeared, upon the inquiry, which served to heighten the mismanagements of govern∣ment, as well as the real grievances of Ireland. The army, in want of pay from the Crown, raised money by military distress, from the subject, to the incredible
<PB N="29" REF="42"/>
amount of two hundred thousand pounds<NOTE N="R" PLACE="foot">Slone and Brewster's Narratives.</NOTE>. The stores left by James in the kingdom, to the value, it was said, of eighty thousand pounds, were embez∣zled or applied to his own use by Coningsby. The lord-lieutenant himself, and Ginckle, who had been created Earl of Athlone, were accused of possessing themselves of almost all the forfeitures which ought to have fallen to the public<NOTE N="S" PLACE="foot">Ibid. passim.</NOTE>. But one of the most flagrant inroads upon the constitution, was the depriv∣ing the citizens of Dublin of their right to chuse their own magistrates.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A remon∣strance on that subject.</NOTE> The lords presented an address, upon the subject of the Irish complaints. The commons sent a remon∣strance to the throne. To the grievances already spe∣cified, the latter added several others of the same a∣larming kind. They complained of the miseries of free quarters, and the licentiousness of the army, to which the Protestant subjects had been exposed. They represented the danger of recruiting the troops, as had been notoriously done, with Irish Papists; and such persons as had been in open rebellion. They averred, that the common course of law was stopt, by granting protections to Roman Catholics, not comprehended within the articles of pacification; and that it was from the mercenary views of the servants of the Crown, that the impolitic addition was made to the treaty with the Papists, at the surrender of Limerick. All these grievances they requested the King to redress; and he promised to rectify all that had been amiss in Ireland. The miseries of that kingdom might, perhaps, have been exaggerated. The expectations of the Protest∣ants were high, from the success of their party. The claims of the Papists were extensive, from the favour∣able articles by which they had finished the war. Re∣cent injuries were added, on both sides, to ancient prejudices and animosities. To satisfy either, was certainly a thing difficult for any government. But it is equally certain, that the servants of the Crown were much less attentive to the happiness of the people,
<PB N="30" REF="43"/>
than to the gratification of their own passions and ava∣rice.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Parliament prorogued, March 14.</NOTE> William seems either to have repented of his promise to the commons, or to have been persuaded from his purpose, by those most concerned in the mismanage∣ments in Ireland. To prevent the parliament from resuming the affair, he prorogued it, on the four∣teenth of March, just four days after receiving the re∣monstrance. He thanked the commons for their large supplies. He signified to the two houses, his intention of going abroad. He promised to continue to expose his person, upon all occasions, for the good and ad∣vantage of his kingdoms; and that his hearty and sin∣cere endeavours should never be wanting, to make the English a great and flourishing nation<NOTE N="T" PLACE="foot">Journals, Mar. 14.</NOTE>. Notwith∣standing this soothing speech, the different parties, in both houses, were highly offended at the sudden pro∣rogation. The Whigs resented the measure, as an aggravating sequel to the King's refusing his assent to the bill for shortening the duration of parliaments. The discontented part of the Tories joined, upon other grounds, the general cry. The Jacobites, be∣ing the most violent in their principles, were least tem∣perate in their language. All parties carried their dis∣contents and arguments to the press. The Earl of Warrington, Hampden, and Wildman were supposed to inflame the Whigs, with publications. The church, offended at the coldness of William, supported the opinions of the high Tories to the world. Ferguson, and several other adherents of James, openly attacked the Revolution, and the personal character and con∣duct of the King<NOTE N="U" PLACE="foot">Publications, 1693.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A stairs of Scotland.</NOTE> The massacre of Glenco had greatly shaken the in∣terest of William, in the minds of his Scottish subjects. The hopes of James arose, in proportion to the odium which a transaction so barbarous had thrown upon the government of his rival. But, prior to that event, the late King had laid a plan for invading Scotland. In the end of the year 1691, he solicited Lewis the Fourteenth, for a force to sail from Brest, Belleisle,
<PB N="31" REF="44"/>
or Rochfort; and to land between Irving and Air. When the King of France had resolved to transport an army into England, under the conduct of James, before the affair of La Hogue, the Scottish expedition was not relinquished. Two frigates, with officers, stores, arms, and a small sum of money, were to sail from Ambleteuse, when the main fleet were to put to sea. The defeat of Tourville broke this, as well as all the other measures of the late King. His attention afterwards was chiefly turned to England. The Earls of Arran and Breadalbin, and Sir James Montgomery, were the only persons of rank in Scotland, who held any correspondence with the court of St. Germains; though the greatest part, by far, of the gentry of the kingdom were in the interest of the late King<NOTE N="W" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, passim.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Obsequious∣ness of its parliament</NOTE> The unexpected blow sustained by the French at La Hogue, and the consequent disappointment of James, threw a damp on his adherents throughout the rest of the year. The nation in general shewed a manifest im∣patience under the government of William. But those who opposed that Prince the most, covered, under specious complaints of grievances, their attachment to his rival. The King, by the advice of secretary John∣ston, managed his affairs with prudence. He gained, by promoting their leaders, the Presbyterians. He reconciled the Duke of Hamilton and his party to his government, by appointing that nobleman commissi∣oner to the approaching parliament. On the eighteenth of April, in the present year, a parliament met at Edinburgh. To flatter the pride of the Scots, the King signified in his letter, that ever since his coming to the Crown, he had been fully resolved to hold a par∣liament, in person, in his ancient kingdom. He de∣clared that nothing but his necessary presence abroad, or the business of his station, when in England, could have hitherto prevented his purpose. The commissi∣oner assured the house, that the King was resolved to support the present establishment, in civil and ecclesi∣astical affairs. He awaked their fears of present dan∣gers, by recounting those he had escaped in the preced∣ing year; and he concluded his speech, with demand∣ing
<PB N="32" REF="45"/>
a supply to place the kingdom in a posture of de∣fence against its enemies. Tweedale, the chancellor, enforced what the commissioner had proposed. He re∣commended that new laws should be made, to strength∣en the authority of government, and to recover the ruined trade of the nation.</P>

The parliament was all sub∣mission. Their answer to the King was full of humi∣lity, acknowledgment, and loyalty. They voted, that four regiments of foot and two of dragoons should be added to the standing forces of the kingdom. To defray the charges of this body of men, and to aid the other expences of government, they granted a supply of one hundred and fourteen thousand pounds sterling. They ratified, by a solemn act, the proceedings of the privy council in impressing seamen. They expell∣ed all absentees, among the commoners, from their house. They fined such lords as declined to attend in parliament. A committee of secrecy had been ap∣pointed, to inquire into the designs of the adherents of the late King. Upon some allegorical letters, that had been intercepted, they formed their report. They declared, that there had been, and still was, a pro∣ject subsisting between the Jacobites and France, for invading the kingdom with a foreign force. Several lords were imprisoned in the castles of Sterling and Edinburgh, rather on suspicion than on proof. One Payne, an Englishman, who was actually an agent for James in Scotland, was in custody, and threatened with a trial. But this zeal for his government, was not properly returned by the King. He declined to levy the new troops. But he took care to raise the tax appointed for their subsistence, and to apply it to other uses of his own<NOTE N="X" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. iii.</NOTE>.</P>

preceding August<NOTE N="Y" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, Nov. 1692.</NOTE>. He carried on successfully his negociations with the discontented, till the month of January. King James, eager to recover his crown, offered terms, which even the most scrupulous among the discontented approved. In a letter, in the end of November, he explained his views, with great mode∣ration and address. He lamented, that it had been hitherto his misfortune to be mistaken in his applica∣tions to his people. He, however, appealed to God, for the uniform sincerity of his heart. He solemnly assured the nation, that, according to the most natu∣ral signification of the words, he was ready to agree to any laws that should be desired, for the security of the Protestant religion, as established in the church of England. He promised to settle, with the concur∣rence of parliament, a liberty of conscience. He was fully resolved, he said, to assent to all laws, for securing effectually the liberty and property of the subject, not only during his own reign, but against all the incroachments of his posterity and successors in the throne. He affirmed, that it was his resolution to meet his people frequently in parliament, as the best expedient to render a King truly great and the subject perfectly happy; and that it was his determined reso∣lution, neither to design nor attempt to introduce any arbitrary power in the crown<NOTE N="Z" PLACE="foot">Ibid.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">the late King</NOTE> He hoped, he said, that he had expressed himself plainly. He declared, that he meant honestly. He was sensible that the nation, besides the violence done to their own principles, had not found their account in the injury they had done to his right. He was no stranger, he said, from that circumstance, that some, who were displeased with the times, pursued projects of redress by other means than his restoration. But he averred, that his return to his native country was the only thing that could either give a better establish∣ment for the future, or relieve them from their pre∣sent distress. He requested his friends, for the great∣er security of the nation, to send any persons they pleased, to discourse with him at large upon the sub∣ject

of his letter. He doubted not, he said, to give any, commissioned to him for that purpose, an entire satisfaction upon every point. To create future con∣fidence, he desired to forget the past. He was resolv∣ed, for his own part, to pardon all the miscarriages of all his subjects, without exception. He expressed his earnest desire to close, in every thing, with the united interest of the people. He requested, that more of them would make him acquainted with their inclina∣tions, without the least degree of flattery; which had often too fatal an influence upon the councils of Kings<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, Nov. 1692.</NOTE>; and he concluded with declaring, that he wished for nothing in the world so earnestly, as to see his people establshed upon the true and legal foun∣dation<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">in England.</NOTE> The malcontents in England were so much disgusted with William, that they received the assurances of James with ardour. The Earl of Middleton, in the month of January, returned to France, with eight proposals from those who wished to restore the late King, upon conditions. They were accepted without hesitation. The high opinion which James always entertained of the importance of the fleet, induced him to apply to the principal officers, with unremit∣ting diligence. Russel had promised, in the preceding autumn, his best endeavours to serve his cause. But William, in consequence of Russel's opposition in par∣liament, and his disputes with the Earl of Notting∣ham, had deprived that officer of the chief command Delaval, Killegrew, and Shovel, were appointed, in a joint commission, to execute the office of admiral. The two first had been, for some time, in the interest of the late King.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His declara∣tion</NOTE> Urged by his own hopes, and the zeal of his friends in England; the late King prepared a declaration, up∣on the eight articles transmitted to France, through the hands of the Earl of Middleton. It was dated at St. Germains, on the seventeenth of April<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">April 17, N. S.</NOTE>. He promised an unlimited pardon to all his subjects, an absolute oblivion of all the past. He declared, that he would immediately call a parliament, inform himself, through them, of the inclinations of his people, and re∣dress, by their concurrence, former grievances, and give every security for their future happiness. He promised to protect the church of England; to secure to its mem∣bers all the churches, universities, colleges, and schools; to confirm their immunities, rights, and pri∣vileges. He pledged his word to recommend to his parliament an impartial liberty of conscience. He de∣clared, that he would never violate the test, and that he would leave the dispensing power of the crown, in other matters, to be explained and limited by the re∣presentatives of the nation. He solemnly promised to give his assent to all such bills as should be found neces∣sary to shorten the duration of parliaments, to secure the freedom of elections, the fair returns of members, and impartial trials.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">to the peo∣ple of Eng∣land.</NOTE> To regain the favour of those who had been most active in the late revolution, he engaged himself to ratify and confirm all such laws, during the govern∣ment of William, as should be tendered to him by his parliament. He declared his willingness to re-establish, in the most ample manner, the act of set∣tlement of Ireland, as passed in his brother's reign; to relinquish the chimney-money, or any other part of the revenue, as should be deemed burdensome to the people, for any other more easy assessment. He assured his peo∣ple, that he had formed his declaration upon the ad∣vice of a great number of his subjects of all ranks and degrees; who had already adjusted the manner of his re-ascending the throne. To remove the apprehensi∣ons
<PB N="36" REF="49"/>
of his subjects, that great sums might be de∣manded by France, he positively assured them, that his most Christian Majesty expected no compensation, but the glory of having succoured an injured Prince. He added, that he was on the eve of coming to vindi∣cate his own right, and to establish the liberties of his people; and he concluded with solemnly praying, that God might so give him success, in the prosecution of the one, as he was sincere in his intentions to confirm the other<NOTE N="E" PLACE="foot">Printed Declaration.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Legal seve∣rities.</NOTE> A month after this declaration was dated in France, it was dispersed privately in England, by the adherents of the late King.

Several violent libels against the government, had raised the resentment and indignation of the courts of justice. The legal severities, of which the peo∣ple formerly complained, seemed, in some cases, to be renewed in all their horror. One Anderton was seized<NOTE N="G" PLACE="foot">May 2.</NOTE>, by the messenger of the press, as the printer of two seditious pamphlets, and committed, for a misdemeanour, to Newgate. But when he offered sufficient bail, he was, by a fresh warrant, continued in prison for high treason. On the trial of this un∣fortunate person, no positive evidence of guilt ap∣peared. Though the statute of treason allowed no conjectural presumptions, no strained inferences, no forced constructions, he was at length condemned. Treby, lord-chief-justice of the common pleas, and formerly a vehement patriot, presided at his trial; and was said to have even surpassed Jefferys himself, in vio∣lence, upon this occasion. He brow-beat the prisoner. He rejected, without any answer, his defence. He revil∣ed and threatened the jury, when they seemed to lean to the favourable side. The novelty of Anderton's case, being the first who had ever suffered death for print∣ing, raised the attention of the public. The lame∣ness of the proof was generally condemned; and to convict upon presumptions, in cases of treason, was

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Campaign in Flanders.</NOTE> The King, impatient to open the campaign in Flan∣ders, left Kensington, on the thirty-first of March, and arrived in the Maese, on the second of April. The French had disturbed the winter itself, with mi∣litary excursions and attacks. They had taken Furnes and Dixmuyde, in the end of November, with their garrisons, consisting chiefly of the English who had re∣duced those places, in the close of the preceding cam∣paign. His own preparations, the necessity of settling, previously, the councils of the Allies, and the difficul∣ty of assembling the forces, detained the King at Loo and the Hague, till the middle of May. Having join∣ed the troops of the Allies at Deigham, he marched from thence to Parks, near Louvaine; and, by that judicious position, is said to have broken the designs of France upon Brabant. Lewis the Fourteenth with an equipage more suitable to a triumph than a cam∣paign, joined his army, consisting of one hundred thousand men, on the second of June. Maestricht, Charleroy, Huy, Brussels and Liege, dreaded by turns the fall of the storm. But the French King having fallen sick, soon after his arrival, returned to Versailles, and left to the Mareschal de Luxembourg the conduct of military operations in Flanders. Luxembourg, on the fifteenth of June, placed his head quarters at Mel∣dert, within half a league of the camp of the Allies. The two armies continued in this situation above a month.

being determined to attack them in their camp, or if they retreated to fall upon their rear. His van was in sight, before they were apprised of his march. The King made the necessary preparations for receiving the enemy with vigour. He sent away his heavy baggage. He ordered his infantry to intrench themselves in the front of his camp. The river Geette bounded his right, and ran, winding, along his rear. On the left, and in the front of the left, was the brook of Landen. A thick hedge joining with one end, the Geete covered part of the front of his right wing. The village of Neerwinden, with entrenchments before it, was situated between the left end of the hedge and the center. The village of Romsdorff stood farther ad∣vanced, opposed to the front of the left wing; and the entrenchment before it stretched to the rivulet of Lan∣den. A line of entrenchments extended themselves be∣hind the two villages; and behind these, the army of the Allies was formed. Their whole front was cover∣ed with one hundred pieces of cannon; which by be∣ing advantageously placed, on an eminence, command∣ed all the approaches to their line<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot">Mem. de Feuquieres.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and defeat Willam</NOTE> On the evening<NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">July 28.</NOTE> of his arrival in sight of the Allies, the Mareschal de Luxembourg dislodged a de∣tachment of the enemy posted in the village of Lan∣den, which stood advanced before the brook of that name. Between this village and that of Romfdorff, he placed forty battalions, in the night. He formed his center of eight lines of horse and foot intermixed. His horse, on the left wing, were ordered to extend themselves to the Geette, opposing their line to the thick hedge which covered the front of the enemy's right. The French were formed before five in the morning, and the cannonading began on both sides. Six brigades, under the Duke of Berwick and two other lieutenant generals, attacked the village of Neer∣winden. This important post was carried. But it was soon recovered by the vigilance of William; who had the good fortune, at the same instant, to see his enemies repulsed on every side. The center of the
<PB N="39" REF="52"/>
French army was not properly sustained by either wing. But the Mareschal de Luxembourg was not to be intimidated. He made a second effort on Neer∣winden. He succeeded. He was again repulsed. He resolved to attack some other quarter of the enemy. They were inaccessible every where. The village of Neerwinden is a third time attacked. William, with great bravery, led twice the English infantry to the entrenchment, which the enemy endeavoured to force. Nothing, however could resist the impetuosity of the French. Their center, reinforced by their right, opened a way for their cavalry into the very lines of the Allies. They flanked the English. They charg∣ed and put to flight the troops of Hanover. They overturned and routed the Spaniards<NOTE N="L" PLACE="foot">William's account. Gazettes.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">at Landen.</NOTE> William perceiving this disorder, advanced sudden∣ly with a part of his left wing. But the enemy gave him no time to form. They flanked the Dutch horse, as they came. They broke them, in a furious onset, before the English could draw into a line. The King, however, was not to be driven from the field. He ordered his troops to charge as they found themselves. His efforts were attended with some success, when he perceived his right wing driven headlong into the Geete. Nothing but confusion could now be seen throughout the camp. Slaughter and flight prevailed every where, on the field. The bridge being too much crowded by the runaways, many were drowned in the river. Wil∣liam retreated, in the same order, with the remains of the left wing. He, however, left a complete vic∣tory to the enemy. Sixty-six pieces of cannon, eight mortars, eighty standards, colours, and other trophies fell into the hands of the French. Twelve thousand of the Allies lay dead in this bloody field. Two thousand were made prisoners. The Mareschal de Luxembourg gained little but glory from the battle of Landen. He lost eight thousand of his best troops, in the action; and his army was so much weakened,

by the number wounded, that he could take no ad∣vantage of the consternation of the enemy<NOTE N="M" PLACE="foot">Hist. de France, tom. iii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections on his con∣duct.</NOTE> William displayed, upon this occasion, great cou∣rage and presence of mind. He exposed his person to danger. He issued his orders with coolness. He was present every where. He has, notwithstanding, been censured, for hazarding, in his circumstances, a gene∣ral engagement. He had detached a considerable num∣ber of his troops, under the Duke of Wertemberg. He had sent a reinforcement to the garrison of Liege<NOTE N="N" PLACE="foot">Mem. de Feuquieres.</NOTE>. In point of numbers, he was much in∣ferior to Luxembourg. He had sufficient time to re∣treat beyond the Geette, and cover himself from in∣sult behind that river<NOTE N="O" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. His post, however, was so strong, that his officers encouraged him to fight; and he himself was extremely anxious to recover the laurels which he had lost in the preceding campaign. Six weeks of inactivity succeeded the battle. Both sides, weakened by their losses, seemed unwilling to grapple again in the field. The Mareschal de Lux∣embourg, being at length reinforced, by detachments from the coasts of Picardy and Normandy, as well as from the army on the upper Rhine, moved toward Charleroy. He sat down before that place, on the eleventh of September. William made no efforts to raise the siege. The garrison behaved themselves with such spirit as deserved relief. The King quitted the army, on the fifth of October; and Charleroy surrendered on the eleventh of that month<NOTE N="P" PLACE="foot">Hist. de France, vol. iii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Campaign on the Up∣per Rhine.</NOTE> On the side of Germany, the French tarnished their success with acts of barbarity and cruelty. The Mareschal de Lorges, having passed the Rhine at Philipsburgh without opposition<NOTE N="Q" PLACE="foot">May 18.</NOTE>, detached de Chamilli, with twenty thousand men, to invest Hey∣delberg. In the midst of dissentions, which prevailed among the garrison, that place was stormed. The soldiers and burghers were promiscuously put to the sword. When slaughter ended, rapine began. The houses were burnt, the churches pillaged, the inhabi∣tants
<PB N="41" REF="54"/>
stripped naked, the women exposed to violence and lust. De Lorges, in the mean time, was pre∣vented from passing the Necker, by the Prince of Baden, who commanded the confederate army. The King of France having undertaken to the Ottomans, to make a powerful diversion on the side of Germany, had detached<NOTE N="R" PLACE="foot">June 10.</NOTE> twenty thousand men from the army in Flanders, to the Upper Rhine. When this rein∣forcement joined de Lorges, the Dauphin assumed the command of the army. That Prince, having dispers∣ed, in vain, a manifesto containing humiliating terms of peace, advanced to the Necker, and crossed that river<NOTE N="S" PLACE="foot">July 29.</NOTE>, with twenty thousand men. The Germans, under the Prince of Baden, unable to contend with such superior numbers, avoided the risque of a battle, in a strong post. The Dauphin returned to Versailles.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">In Piedmont</NOTE> The operations of the armies, on the side of Pied∣mont, having languished throughout the summer, end∣ed in a decisive action, in the beginning of October<NOTE N="T" PLACE="foot">October 4.</NOTE>. The duke of Savoy, at the head of the confederates, sat down before Pignerol. The Mareschal de Cati∣nat, having been reinforced with ten thousand men, from the army on the Upper Rhine, descended from the mountains; and, from his motions, seemed to threaten Turin. The Duke, having bombarded Pig∣nerol, raised the siege, on the second of October. He advanced to the small river Cisola, where it passes by Marsaglia. He sent away his heavy baggage, resolv∣ing to engage de Catinat. The next day, the two armies came in sight and formed themselves in order of battle. Neither side shewing any inclination to come to battle, the consederates lay, all night, on the field, in their arms. When day light appeared, the French were already formed. The allies were in∣stantly in motion. The Imperial and Piedmontese cavalry, commanded by the Duke in person, covered the right wing. The insantry, consisting of the in∣fantry
<PB N="42" REF="55"/>
of Savoy and Great Britain, were in the cen∣ter, under the famous Prince Eugene. The Spaniards, led by their native officers, formed the left wing. The French began the attack, in an unusual manner. They received the fire of the Spaniards, as they advanced, and then charged them, with bayonets fixed and sword in hand. The whole wing was broken in an instant and thrown, in their confusion, on the center. The battle was sustained, by the latter, with great obsti∣nacy. They were, however, broken, at length, and forced to fly. A complete victory remained to the French. The cannon, colours, standards, and light baggage of the allies, fell into the hands of the enemy. They lost eight thousand men in the field. The Duke of Schomberg, who commanded the troops in the pay of Great Britain, was wounded and taken pri∣soner. He was released, on his parole; and soon af∣ter died at Turin<NOTE N="U" PLACE="foot">Mem. de Marq. Feuquiers. Gazettes.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">In Spain and Hunga∣ry.</NOTE> The French were successful, on every side during this campaign. In Catalonia, the Mareschal de Noail∣les took Roses, in the sight of the enemy. The Spa∣niards, enfeebled by the despicable councils of Charles the Second, were unable to repel the victors. The French were too few and ill provided to pursue the advantages which they had obtained. Besides, the Mareschal de Noailles had embarked six thousand men, to reinforce de Catinat's army in Piedmont. Both sides remained inactive, from May till the end of the year. The war, in Hungary, produced no sig∣nal event. The Imperialists, under the Duke de Croy, laid siege to Belgrade in vain. After five weeks open trenches, they stormed the counterscarp. But they were repulsed with great slaughter. The grand Vi∣zier advanced, in the mean time, with an army. The Duke de Croy, having called a council of war, resolved to raise the siege. He sent away his heavy baggage. He repassed, with his army, the Saave. The defeat of a few Tartars, in the neighbourhood of Giulia, was magnified by the Imperialists, to cover the disgrace of an inactive and inglorious campaign<NOTE N="W" PLACE="foot">Hist des Ottomans, vol. ii.</NOTE>.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs at sea.</NOTE> The same bad fortune whch pursued the allies by land, attended their operations at sea. The war in Flanders having ingrossed the whole attention of Wil∣liam, the navy was much neglected by his servants. Notwithstanding the great supplies that had been grant∣ed, the fleet was not ready to sail till the middle of May; and then it was feebly manned, and ill supplied with necessaries and provisions. Killegrew, Delaval, and Shovel, who executed the office of admiral, hav∣ing been reinforced by the Dutch, arrived at St. He∣lens, on the seventh of May. The whole fleet was to have consisted of one hundred sail of men of war, seventy of which were to have been of the line. They, however, had not all rendezvoused when the admirals arrived. These officers, destitute of intelligence them∣selves, and receiving no orders from the ministry, were uncertain how to proceed. The French had made the greatest preparations, in all their ports. They repaired and refitted all their men of war. They bought and armed all the largest merchantmen. They manned, with activity and success, the whole fleet. All their ships, in the ports of the ocean, had assembled at Brest, under Tourville. The squadron equipped at Toulon, and commanded by D'Estrees, received orders to advance to the Streights. King James con∣tinued to solicit the court of France, to make another attempt on England; and the sanguine adherents of that unfortunate Prince could ascribe such preparati∣ons to nothing but a fixed resolution to re-establish their master on his throne<NOTE N="X" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1693.</NOTE>.</P>

Though powerful fleets were sent by the nation to sea, indivi∣duals had suffered much from the privateers of the enemy.

They were put off, however, by delays. Four hundred merchantmen, consisting of English, Dutch, and Hamburghers, bound for the Streights, lay waiting for a convoy, in May. On the nineteenth of that month, orders were sent from the admiralty, for the whole fleet to sail, as far as might seem requisite, with the merchantmen. They accordingly sailed, on the thirtieth, and proceeded fifty leagues beyond Ushant. Sir George Rooke, with a squadron of twenty-three men of war, English and Dutch, proceeded with the trade toward the Streights.

He lay in that place till the fifteenth of June, when Rooke, and the fleet under his convoy, appeared. The English admiral, deceived by false intelligence concerning the strength of the enemy, prepared to engage. Perceiving his mistake, he stood away with an easy sail. He ordered, at the same time, the merchantmen nearest to the land to shift for themselves in the ports of Spain. The enemy gaining fast upon him, he made sail. The French came up with the sternmost ships. Three Dutch men of war fell into the hands of the enemy. Eighty merchant∣men were either taken in their flight or destroyed in ports where they had taken shelter. The rest owed their escape to the bad conduct of Tourville.

Rooke, losing sight of most of the merchantmen, made the best of his way to Madeira. He returned from that island to Ireland, and, soon after, rejoined the main fleet. The rest of the naval campaign, if the expression may be used, was ingloriously inactive. The admi∣rals, having cruized for a few weeks in the mouth of the channel, were driven into Torbay by contrary winds. They were ordered round to St. Helens, and the capital ships laid up for the year. The victories of the enemy by land, the disgrace and loss of the nation at sea, the disappointment of individuals, and the discontents which ever accompany national mis∣fortunes, filled the whole kingdom with complaints, murmurs, and noise The merchants of London pre∣sented a remonstrance, rather than an address, to the Queen. They enumerated the hardships imposed up∣on trade, by the want of convoys. They exagge∣rated past evils, they magnified the present, they ex∣pressed their anxiety for the future. This spirit of resentment spread from London to the rest of the na∣tion. In the events of the past years of the war, some glory had been blended with disappointment. But the present year was uniformly covered with mis∣fortune and disgrace. Disputes in the cabinet were joined to the disgusts among the people.

The King him∣self was incapable of constraining his temper into a complaisance, which, with a generous people, might supply the want of success<NOTE N="E" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. iii.</NOTE>.

The Marquis of Caermarthen, either disgusted with William, or in hopes of profit∣ing by the restoration of James, had entered into the views of the latter Prince. James requested him to betray the councils of the King, and to obstruct and defeat his measures in parliament. He desired him, if he could depend upon his son, to induce him to keep his command in the navy. He instructed the Earl of Shrewsbury, the Earl of Marlborough, and the Lord Godolphin to exert themselves secretly against William, to hinder, or at least to retard, the giving of money, to prevent the early sailing of the sleet, in the following year<NOTE N="G" PLACE="foot">Stu∣art-papers, Oct. 1693.</NOTE>.</P>

Whether the King of France should publish a formal declaration, that he entertained no views with regard to England, except the re-establishment of her native King? He desired them freely to advise him, in all matters concerning their interest and his own views. He requested Admi∣ral Russel, who had continued his communications with the court of St. Germains, to endeavour to procure the command of the fleet. He desired him to sup∣press

The adherents of the late King insinuated, that to restore Russel to the command of the fleet, was to soothe the nation for the miscarriages at sea. He was accordingly replaced in his former office, on the sixth of November. The anxiety with which James pursued this point, is as unaccountable as it is remarkable. Deleval and Killegrew, two out of the three joint admirals, were devoted to his service<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot">Stu∣art-papers. Ibid.</NOTE>. But he, perhaps, perceived, that it was impossible for them to retain their offices in opposition to a torrent of popular clamours. The first had been raised by the late King, and owed every thing to that Prince. The latter depended on Caermarthen, who had resolved to favour a restoration.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Whigs as well as Tories.</NOTE> Though James depended much upon the zeal of Admiral Russel, he derived still greater hopes from the Marquis of Caermarthen. Though that lord was in part prime minister to William, he had entered in∣to the most solemn engagements with the late King. He had promised to gain to his interest the county of York, of which he was lord-lieutenant; to surrender to him the citadel of Hull, of which he was gover∣nor. The want of success by land, the disgraces at sea, the unpopularity and forbidding manner of Wil∣liam, his bad state of health, which promised no per∣manency to the fabric which he had reared, disap∣pointments in some, a return of their former prin∣ciples in others, the discontents and even levity of all, had increased, to a surprising degree, the party of the abdicated King. The Whigs were equally for∣ward with the Tories; and more dangerous, as they were more resolute in their political views. In the list of noble correspondents with the court of St. Germains, the two parties were blended with one
<PB N="48" REF="61"/>
another, in the present year. James had received the most solemn assurances from four dukes, four mar∣quises, twenty earls, four viscounts, eleven barons, beside the Roman Catholics, in every degree of no∣bility.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">most of the clergy, ma∣ny in the army,</NOTE> The whole body of the non-juring clergy, consist∣ing of six bishops, and six hundred ministers, and four fifths of those who had taken the oaths. were ready to join the late King, to preach in favour of his authori∣ty, to convince the people that the Protestant religion was in no danger. The cities of Bristol and Exeter in the West, and, in the North, the town of Boston, had signified their loyalty to James, through their re∣spective leaders. The Earl of Yarmouth, in the name of seventeen baronets, and one hundred and thirty gentlemen, promised for the county of Norfolk. The gentlemen of Essex assured the late King, that they would join him with a body of cavalry, at a pro∣per time. The Earl of Litchfield promised for the county and city of Oxford. The Earl of Lindsey for the county of Lincoln. Sir John Friend answered for a regiment of cavalry and two of militia, with which he hoped to possess himself of the Tower<NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">Stuart papers, Oct. Nov. Dec. 1693.</NOTE>. Colo∣nel Selwin promised for Tilbury fort and a regiment of infantry; Lieutenant-colonel Row for his own regi∣ment, Colonel Greenville for that of his uncle the Earl of Bath. Crawford, governor of Sheerness, un∣dertook to deliver that fort to James. The Marquis of Caermathen, then president of the council, promis∣ed for Hull. The private soldiers, in some regi∣ments, had formed associations for the late King. One hundred troopers of the royal regiment of cavalry ac∣quainted him, that they had sufficient credit with their companions, to bring back the whole to their former allegiance. They even solemnly undertook to <Q REND="inline">"cut the throats"</Q> of such of their comrades and officers, as should dare to oppose their design.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">his former greatest enemies, and those who</NOTE> It is remarkable, that those who had been the most violent enemies of James, when he was on the throne, were his most zealous friends in his distress. The county of Somerset, the seat of Monmouth's rebellion and Jefferys's cruelties, was now ready to receive him with open arms. The town of Taunton itself, that had suffered so much eight years before, for opposing James, expressed the greatest affection for his person and the warmest zeal for his restoration. The legal severities of the year 1685 must, therefore, have been exaggerated; or the people acquitted the King of the rigorous conduct of his servants. The Lord Powlet, and the majority of the gentlemen of the county, to∣gether with the citizens of Taunton, solemnly engag∣ed themselves to James, to rise in his cause. Even individuals were as unsteady to their former principles, as bodies of men. The famous Ferguson, who had uniformly abetted the opposition to the late King, till he lost his throne, employed, at this time, all the ve∣hemence of his active spirit in his cause. He request∣ed, he even implored him to invade the kingdom. To testify his own zeal, to encourage James with a certainty of his success, he proposed to deliver him∣self up in France to be punished with death, should the enterprise fail. Some of the clergy who had most opposed James, ran so violently into the other extreme, that they were determined to form themselves into a company of volunteers, to serve in the regiment com∣manded by Sir John Friend<NOTE N="M" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1693.</NOTE>.</P>

William having distinguished Sunderland with his favour, for former services, furnished that
<PB N="50" REF="63"/>
lord, a second time, with an opportunity to betray. Having, with his usual address, convinced the adhe∣rents of King James of the sincerity of his repentance, he wrote a letter full of contrition for his past con∣duct, to that Prince. He told him, that a descent, with a competent force, was the only means of finish∣ing the misfortunes of the King, and the miseries of the nation. He informed him, that from the state of the kingdom, an invasion could not fail of success. He declined to enter into particulars, because he was afraid his Majesty did not confide sufficiently in his advice. But when he should be assured that the King was satisfied with his fidelity, he promised to send the best intelligence; and to contribute all in his power to his service. The Earl of Arran vouched for the sincerity of Sunderland. The Earl of Marlborough pleaded in his favour. But James had felt so much from his treachery before, that even his pursuing the natural bias of his mind, with regard to William, could not convince him, for some time, that Sunderland was sincere<NOTE N="N" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1694.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Parliament meets.</NOTE> Such was the secret state of affairs before, and some time after the two houses met, for the dispatch of the public business. William opened the session, on the seventh of November, with a speech from the throne. He lamented, that his usual joy at meeting his parlia∣ment, was damped by disadvantages by land, and miscarriages at sea. He ascribed the former to the number of their enemies. He expressed his resentment against the authors of the latter. He declared his re∣solution to punish the offenders. He promised to ma∣nage better, for the future, his power at sea. He de∣sired them to consider, whether the kingdom was not defective in the number of ships; and in proper ports to annoy the enemy, and to protect themselves. He was very sensible, he said, of the great affection with which they had supported him against his enemies. But he was persuaded, that the experience of the last summer was sufficient to convince them all, that an increase of forces, by sea and land, was necessary to put a happy period to the war. His allies, he said,
<PB N="51" REF="64"/>
had resolved to add to their troops. He formed no doubt, on his part, but his parliament would enable him, with a suitable supply, to follow their example. He earnestly requested the commons to hasten their grants, in order to render them effectual. On their expeditious councils would depend, he concluded, that forwardness in his preparations, which seemed necessary to the security and honour of the nation<NOTE N="O" PLACE="foot">Journals, Nov. 7, 1693.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceedings of the com∣mons.</NOTE> Many in the lower house were attached to the late King. But the majority, though tories in principle, had uniformly supported the cause of William. The people, discouraged with repeated misfortunes, and feeling the weight of the war on every branch of their commerce, were loud in demanding peace. Some of the Tory-leaders in office, particularly the Earl of Nottingham, joined the voice of the people. Others of the same party sacrificed their opinion to their interest; and adhered to the court. A dispute arose in the house, whether the miscarriages of the fleet, or the supply, should be the first object of their consideration. The question was carried for the latter, after a series of debates, which continued six days. On the thirteenth of November, the house unani∣mously resolved to support their Majesties, and their government, to their utmost power. Notwithstand∣ing the vast sums raised in the preceding year, they had greatly fallen short of the expences of government. Those who served in the army, were in the utmost distress for money. More than one million of the wages of the seamen, without any funds, remained unpaid. Though the greatest severities were used, the sailors, in their distress, became mutinous for want of pay. The first business, therefore, of the commons, was to grant four hundred thousand pounds, by way of advance, to remove immediately a part of that grievance. This sum was to be raised on the ge∣neral credit of the exchequer, upon the promise of the commons to repay it with interest, after the rate of seven per cent, under a caution, that this proceed∣ing should form no precedent<NOTE N="P" PLACE="foot">Journals. Nov. 25.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="65"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">They grant large sup∣plies.</NOTE> WITH equal alacrity the commons entered upon the great business of supply. Upon the general esti∣mates of the navy and army, they granted five milli∣ons, for the service of the following year. Forty thousand seamen, including two regiments of marines, were required by government, and voted by the house. But to a demand of one hundred thousand men, for the land-service, they granted only eighty-three thousand. In this only they seemed uncomplaisant to the court. Besides a provision made for paying all wages due to seamen, more than four hundred thou∣sand pounds were voted, for making up the deficien∣cies in the grants of the preceding year. It was much more easy to grant the supplies in general, than to find particular funds, upon which they might be laid. The commons began with a land-tax. Four shillings in the pound were carried, as soon as proposed<NOTE N="Q" PLACE="foot">Dec. 21. Dec. 29.</NOTE>. The deficiencies of the last year were to be defrayed from this ready fund. The second money bill was a supplement to the million annuity act of the year 1692. Near one hundred and twenty thousand pounds were still deficient; though fourteen per cent, had been al∣lowed. Some appropriations of excise duties were made for this purpose. The first lottery, and the bank of England, were two remarkable money-bills, in the present session of parliament. One million was raised by means of the first; and one million five hun∣dred thousand pounds by the second. Still the ways and means fell short of the money wanted. New tax∣es were imposed and appropriated as funds of credit, for raising the deficiencies which still subsisted in the necessary supplies<NOTE N="R" PLACE="foot">Journals, passim.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Other pro∣ceedings</NOTE> THE inquiry into the mismanagements at sea, pro∣duced nothing but altercation and debate. A general censure was passed. But the censure was attended with no consequences. The malcontents in the house of commons being the minority, founded their opposi∣tion on popular grounds. The bill for frequent parlia∣ments was again introduced, and a second time reject∣ed. The place-bill was passed by the commons, with∣out

opposition. The lords made amendments. But they withdrew them, and passed also that important bill. The facility with which it slipt through both houses, proceeded probably from the certainty that it was to be rejected by the King. The commons had become unpopular, through the vast sums which they had granted for supporting an inglorious war. To re∣gain their credit with their constituents, they fram∣ed the place-bill. William, seldom subject to politi∣cal terror, refused his assent<NOTE N="S" PLACE="foot">Jan. 25th, 1694.</NOTE>. Though the com∣mons, in all appearance, would have been much dis∣appointed, had the place-bill passed into a law; they remonstrated against the conduct of the King. They voted, that whoever had advised the refusal of the royal assent to the act touching free and impartial pro∣ceedings in parliament, was an enemy to their Majes∣ties and the kingdom. The King's answer was sooth∣ing, but nothing to the purpose. In return for their liberality, he permitted his commons to recover some part of their reputation with the people at his own ex∣pence<NOTE N="T" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1693.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">of the two houses</NOTE> THE affairs of the East-India company, which had already employed so much of the attention of parlia∣ment, produced undecisive debates in the present sessi∣on. The train of corruption, which soon after broke forth in such disgraceful discoveries, had been already laid. The complicated nature of the business, and the violent opposition of the merchants, prevented the friends of the company from making an immediate re∣turn for the favours which they had desired to receive. A bill for a general naturalization of all foreign Protes∣tants, created violent debates in the house of com∣mons. Those who opposed it, called the prejudices of the populace to the aid of their cause. They averred, that the design of the act was to place all the power and authority in England in the hands of Aliens. The people knew the affection of the King, for his coun∣trymen the Dutch. They believed that he would sooner trust any foreigners than his own subjects. The Jacobite party, in particular, were vehement in their
<PB N="54" REF="67"/>
<MILESTONE N="1694" UNIT="year"/> opposition. Sir John Knight, one of the members for the city of Bristol, who was at that very time in correspondence with James<NOTE N="U" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1693.</NOTE>, spoke with uncom∣mon violence against the bill. He concluded with a motion, that the bill should be kicked out of the house, and the foreigners out of the kingdom. The people were inflamed to a degree of madness; and the court-party sacrificed the bill to the public rage.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">of parlia∣ment.</NOTE> To pursue the session to its period, we must trans∣gress upon the order of time. The grievances of Ire∣land were again revived, as they had not been redress∣ed, in pursuance of the King's promise. The Irish gentlemen who had made their appeal to the English parliament, complained afresh of Coningsby and Porter; whose injustice and tyranny had exceeded all bounds. The Earl of Bellamont impeached them both, in the house of commons. The articles against Con∣ingsby contained charges of the blackest kind. The accusation against Porter, was scarce less severe. Bel∣lamont supported, with vouchers, every charge. The commons seemed convinced of the guilt. But they declined to ground upon them an impeachment. The reason which they assigned, was plausible if not suffi∣cient. They insinuated, that in times of domestic commotions and civil war, exertions of power might be necessary, which should not be punished, though they ought not to be approved. Though this argument satisfied the commons, it was notorious, that the crimes charged upon the accused, were com∣mitted after the establishment of a civil government and the opening of the courts of Justice. Bellamont, for endeavouring to punish others, was actually per∣secuted himself. He was deprived of his place un∣der the government, while Coningsby and Porter received a pardon under the great seal<NOTE N="W" PLACE="foot">Journals, passim.</NOTE>.

<P><MILESTONE N="1694 January" UNIT="year"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Several per∣sons of rank</NOTE> WHILE the parliament were employed in grant∣ing supplies to William, the agents of James were forming secret schemes against his power. Men of the first quality in the nation, and some of those in office, endeavoured, with every flattering colour of the state of affairs, to encourage Lewis the Fourteenth to transport an army into Britain. They observed, in their letters to the late King, that a descent in Eng∣land would infallibly break the league; and enable France to finish with advantage, as well as reputation, the war. They assured him, that while the confede∣rates remained united, the kingdom would be wretch∣ed and his own affairs obstructed, if not ruined. Penn, the famous Quaker, informed James, in express terms, <Q REND="inline">"that while there was a fool in England, the Prince of Orange would have a pensioned parliament to give him supplies."</Q> Among others, the Earl of

Marlborough continued to espouse, with eagerness, his former master's cause. He intreated him to take ad∣vantage of the unprepared state of the English fleet. He gave him the most solemn assurances of his own services, and the hearty aid of all his party and nume∣rous friends<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1693, 1694.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">in corres∣pondence with the late King.</NOTE> The adherents of the late King, in all their repre∣sentations in the preceding year, agreed that thirty thousand men would be necessary to ensure a revolu∣tion in England. When they perceived a coldness in the court of France, they lessened their demands. In the month of February they assured James, that they found his party much stronger than they had ever imagined before. They said twenty thousand men would now be sufficient to give him, without a battle, the throne. They affirmed, that the nation expected, with impatience, his arrival. They told him, that England could not, till the month of April, send to sea above twenty-five third and fourth rate men of war, and these not completely manned. That no more than seven thousand five hundred troops were then in the kingdom; and that even these would be diminished to four thousand, when the regiments des∣tined for Flanders, should embark for that country<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">Ibid. Feb. 1694</NOTE>. Lewis listened, with some attention, to the unfortu∣nate King. But he meant nothing less, than to un∣dertake, with any vigour, his cause. Though victori∣ous in the field, he was oppressed with calamities at home. Having exerted his whole force in the late campaigns, he had already impoverished his subjects with grievous taxes. Besides, a terrible famine, had added, in the preceding summer, to the miseries which arose from the war<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">Hist. de France, tom. iii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Intrigues of Marl∣borough,</NOTE> But James was not discouraged, either with the lan∣gour of Lewis or the exhausted state of France. Though he placed little confidence<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, March 1694. James II. 1694.</NOTE> in the professi∣ons of the noble converts to his cause, he sent Captain Lloyd, in the month of March, to England. To fa∣cilitate
<PB N="57" REF="70"/>
<MILESTONE N="1694 March" UNIT="year"/> his access to Admiral Russel, and to the Earls of Marlborough and Shrewsbury, he ordered him to apply to Colonel Sackville, their common friend. Marlborough was the first of the malcontents who pre∣sented himself to Lloyd. He informed him, that he had been solicited by William to come again into office. But that he did not chuse to accept, without the con∣sent of his old master. Lloyd assured him, that James had actually heard of the offer; and that he had order∣ed him to signify his consent. "The thing," replied Marlborough, <Q REND="inline">"is now past. Should the offer, which may well happen, again be made, I will accept. But it is only to serve the King; for whose re-establish∣ment, I am resolved to risque my life to expiate my crimes<NOTE N="E" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, March, 1694. James II. 1694.</NOTE>."</Q> He had made the same professions to James himself in a letter, in the preceding December. Admiral Russel received Lloyd with still greater marks of attention and regard. He assured him, with the strongest asseverations and even with oaths, that he would undertake the restoration of the late King. He promised to endeavour to gain the officers of the fleet. He reiterated his most solemn protestations of fidelity. He told him, that the Earls of Shrewsbury and Marl∣borough should be the winesses, the judges and sureties of his conduct. He, however, refused to avoid the French fleet; "though," said he, <Q REND="inline">"I once deter∣mined to execute that business, as it depended then on myself alone<NOTE N="F" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Russel,</NOTE> Lloyd, not yet satisfied with the answer of Russel, opened various expedients to his view. He told him that there certainly was a design in agitation for making a descent on the coast of France. He, therefore, re∣quested Russel to send timely information to James, that transports might be prepared, where no attack could be feared. He proposed, that toward the end of autumn, when the large ships should be disarmed and convoys sent to America, he might retain in the channel such commanders as he should gain in the summer. That safe in their fidelity, he might him∣self
<PB N="58" REF="71"/>
transport such troops, as might be necessary for accompanying the late King to England. He still pro∣tested, but seemed unwilling to determine on any plan. Lloyd gave an account to the Earl of Marlborough and to Sackville of his conference with Russel. They observed, that he said a great deal, could he be trust∣ed. But that if he was not sincere, all he could say would answer no purpose<NOTE N="G" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, passim.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Shrewsbury,</NOTE> The Earl of Shrewsbury had succeeded Notting∣ham as secretary of state, on the fourth of March, a few days before Lloyd arrived from France. His be∣ing in office prevented him from admitting into his pre∣sence the avowed agent of the late King. He, how∣ever, sent his mother, the old Countess of Shrews∣bury, to Lloyd, with assurances of his fidelity. He instructed her to inform him, that upon being solicit∣ed to take the seals, he declined that honour, under the pretence of want of health. That William insi∣nuated he was no stranger to some words which the earl dropt in conversation, in favour of the late King. That the earl perceived there might be some danger in refusing the offer. That he, therefore, promised to accept. But that he requested a few days, to set∣tle his affairs in the country. That he accordingly re∣tired, with some friends, well mounted. That, as reports of an immediate descent were then current, he had resolved to join James on his landing. That he was disappointed in his hopes, to his very great regret. That he was obliged to take the seals, on his return. But that he only held them, to serve the late King with more effect<NOTE N="H" PLACE="foot">Ibid. March 1694.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Godolphin,</NOTE> Godolphin was, at this juncture, first lord-com∣missioner of the treasury. Though he was trusted by William, he affected to be in the interest of the late King. He explained to Lloyd his sentiments of James, in the most affectionate manner in the world. He expressed his fears, that a peace was likely to be con∣cluded before the end of the next summer. He told him, that he was sorry to believe, from the words of the Prince of Orange, for so he called the reigning
<PB N="59" REF="72"/>
King, that the terms would be highly prejudicial to the late King. He informed him, that William would endeavour to oblige the most Christian King to send James out of the dominions of France. That he thought it his duty to acquaint his old master of the designs of his enemy and rival. He told it as his opi∣nion, that King James should forthwith endeavour to transport himself into England, with a considerable force. That there appeared to him no difficulty in making a descent in this kingdom, without either the aid or concurrence of Russel. That, however, he ought still to be treated with attention. That he had said all that could be expected from a person in his situation. That the Earl of Shrewsbury, who was sincerely in the interest of the late King, possessed an absolute influence over Russel. He assured Lloyd, that Russel would infallibly appear before Brest. That this circumstance would give a just pretence to Lewis to send an army to the coast. He advised, therefore, that the necessary transports might be pre∣pared in the summer, to carry to Britain the invaders in autumn. He told him, that the large vessels would return to port in the middle of September. That the sailors would be dispersed, the convoys sent to the different places of commerce, the coast left bare of men of war. That he believed a revolution might be effected without a blow; as nine in ten of the people, either heartily detested William, or were firmly at∣tached to the late King<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, March 1694.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunderland,</NOTE> Though the Earl of Sunderland possessed no office under William, he held, for an Englishman, a high place in his favour. Swayed by the natural levity of his own mind, or infected with the changed opinions of others, he continued his correspondence with the late King. He, however, was more guarded in his intercourse with that Prince, than those great men who trusted their lives and fortunes in the hands of intermediate agents. His son-in-law the Earl of Ar∣ran, who first promoted his intrigues with the court of St. Germains, was the only person in the secret in
<PB N="60" REF="73"/>
Britain<NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, March 1694.</NOTE>. In France, James concealed, with great caution, his intercourse with a man who had so much injured his cause before. Sunderland pressed the late King to an immediate invasion upon various grounds. He intreated that Prince to take advantage of the changed opinions of the people; their contempt for William, their discontent at the late heavy taxes, their losses at sea, their disappointments in the war by land. These circumstances, he informed him, would ensure a favourable reception to himself in the king∣dom, while the design of sending the greatest part of the fleet to the Streights, and almost the whole of the army to Flanders, would render his passage easy and his success certain. He advised the late King not to be intimidated with the great supplies granted to the reigning Prince, as the money given by the parlia∣ment, could not be raised in time to place the king∣dom in a state of defence<NOTE N="L" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Whigs and Tories pro∣miscuously in office.</NOTE> While Sunderland tendered thus his advice to James, HE and the Earl of Portland formed the secret cabi∣net of William<NOTE N="M" PLACE="foot">Dutch encroachments, p. 20.</NOTE>. That Prince felt some part of the misfortunes, which he had contributed to throw on his predecessor, when he sat on the throne. He was worst served by those whom he courted the most. Impressed with the opinion, that interest forms the principles of men, he resolved to bribe into fidelity those whom he could not otherwise trust. In the ar∣rangements of the present year, he seems however to have regarded most the supposed Whigs. The admi∣ralty, in particular, was placed in the hands of that party. Russel was made first commissioner; Rook and Houblon supplanted the obnoxious admirals Dela∣val and Killigrew, at the board. Though William seems to have entertained some well-grounded suspici∣ons of Shrewsbury, he was accounted a Whig by the nation; and though the Marquis of Caermarthen was considered a Tory, by principle, his known prudence was deemed a security for his faith to the prevailing powers. But some other persons of rank, who were
<PB N="61" REF="74"/>
known to be adverse to the late revolution, were either continued in employment or raised to office. Among the latter, the Earl of Abingdon, then actually in correspondence with James, succeeded to a place of profit, vacant by the death of the Lord Lovelace<NOTE N="N" PLACE="foot">Gazette.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Titles con∣ferred.</NOTE> On the twenty-fifth of April, a few days after he prorogued his parliament, William went to Graves∣end to embark at that place for Holland. The wind proving contrary, he returned to Kensington the next day. This accident furnished the King with a further opportunity of gratifying some of his principal subjects with dignities and honours. But though he had of late shown some attention to the Whigs, his first care seems still to have been commanded by the Tories. The Marquis of Caermarthen was created, on the thirtieth of April, Duke of Leeds. The title of Duke of Shrewsbury was conferred upon the Earl of the same name. The Earl of Clare, then deeply en∣gaged with James<NOTE N="O" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1693, 1694.</NOTE>, was raised to the dignity of Duke of Newcastle. The Earl of Mulgrave, a secret abettor of the designs of the late King<NOTE N="P" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>, was made Marquis of Normanby, with an annual pension of three thousand pounds. But no titles of honour, nor even views of profit, could reconcile these men either to the manner or title of the King. Shrewsbury and Leeds, whose advice Mary was implicitly to follow, in her husband's absence, were to have embarrassed and betrayed her councils, should her father appear with a force in England<NOTE N="Q" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. To stop their cla∣mours, rather than to gratify the party who had raised him to the throne, the King, before his departure for Holland, had ordered patents for dukedoms to be pre∣pared, for the Earls of Bedford and Devonshire. The first derived his title to a name in party, from the fate of his unfortunate son. Disappointments in his views for the public, as well as personal neglect, had ren∣dered the latter indifferent concerning the fate of Wil∣liam, and the permanency of his authority<NOTE N="R" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 1690, 1691.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="75"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Preparati∣ons at Sea.</NOTE> On the fourth of May, the King embarked at Gravesend. But the wind being contrary, he went by land to Margate; and was escorted from that place to Holland by a squadron of Dutch men of war. The projected operations of the summer at sea, had em∣ployed a great part of his attention during the winter. His councils, however, were betrayed. The desti∣nations of the different squadrons were generally known<NOTE N="S" PLACE="foot">Stuart papers, 1694.</NOTE>. Nothing but the time of their departure, which depended upon accidents, remained a secret. Sir Francis Wheeler, with a strong squadron of Eng∣lish and Dutch men of war, had been sent to convoy the trade to the Mediterranean, in the end of the preceding year. On the seventeenth of February, a terrible tempest overtook his fleet; in the bay of Gib∣raltar. The admiral himself, some ships of war, and several merchantmen were lost. The rest were dis∣abled. Some took shelter in Gibraltar, many in the harbour of Cadiz. The combined fleets were not as∣sembled on the coast of England, till the end of April. Russel hoisted his flag, at Portsmouth, on the twenty-seventh of that month; and his avowed design was to sail into the Mediterranean, to defend the ports of Spain from the French; who were resolved to make the principal effort of the campaign on that side<NOTE N="T" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. iii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An expedi∣tion against Brest.</NOTE> But the chief enterprise of the season, was to be di∣rected against Brest. The lord Godolphin had fur∣nished the late King, in the month of March, with this important intelligence<NOTE N="U" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1694.</NOTE>. But from the uncer∣tainty which attended the sailing of the fleet, he could not fix the time. General Talmash, contrary to the express opinion of Russel, promoted first, and at length carried this design. When the admiral hoisted his flag, at St. Helens, the land-forces destined for the expedi∣tion, were on their march, under Talmash, to Ports∣mouth. The French had made no secret of their re∣solution to assist, with their whole fleet, the designs of the Mareschal de Noailles upon Barcelona. The court of Spain had concerted with William, to send
<PB N="63" REF="76"/>
the main body of the combined fleet to protect the place. Men in general believed that the force under Talmash, was destined for the same service. The French were either ignorant of the preparations of the English, or they knew not where the storm was to fall. The alarm concerning Brest, which had been raised by the intelligence sent by Godolphin to James, had already subsided. Besides, the danger of France, upon that side, had been lessened by the actual sailing of her fleet from the port of Brest, on the fifteenth of April<NOTE N="W" PLACE="foot">April 15th, N. S.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Betrayed by the Earl of Marlbo∣rough, May 4th.</NOTE> The zeal of the Earl of Marlborough for the service of the late King, or his aversion to the reigning Prince, induced that nobleman to become, upon this occasion, an informer against his country. He transmitted, through the hands of colonel Sackville, intelligence of the danger to which France was exposed. His letter was dated, on the fourth of May. He informed James, that twelve regiments encamped at Ports∣mouth, with two regiments of marines, all command∣ed by Talmash, were designed for destroying Brest, and the ships of war in that harbour. He owned, that success in the enterprise would prove of great ad∣vantage to England. But that no consideration could now hinder, or ever should prevent him from inform∣ing his Majesty of all that he believed to be for his ser∣vice. He desired the late King to make the best use of the intelligence. He told him, that he might de∣pend on its being exactly true. But he conjured him, for his own interest, to keep the secret to himself and the Queen. He informed him that Russel was to sail, the next day, with forty ships; and that the rest of the fleet, with the land-forces, were to follow the ad∣miral, in ten days. He had endeavoured, he said, to learn the whole from Russel. But he always denied the fact, though he was no stranger to the design, for six weeks before. "This," continues the Earl, <Q REND="inline">"gives me a bad sign of this man's intentions."</Q> Sackville, who transmitted the letter, formed, for the same reason, a like unfavourable opinion of Russel.
<PB N="64" REF="77"/>
He mentioned, <Q REND="inline">"that THE MAN had not acted sin∣cerely; and that he feared he would never act other∣wise<NOTE N="X" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, May 1694. James II. 1694.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The enter∣prise mis∣carries.</NOTE> The event established the truth of the intelligence transmitted by Marlborough. Russel sailed, the next day, with a part of the combined fleets. Shovel re∣mained at St. Helens, with the rest, to take Talmash and his troops on board. On the twenty-third of May, the admiral, having discovered that the French squad∣ron had left Brest, returned. On the twenty-ninth, he again put to sea with the forces; and, on the fifth of June, the division of the fleet destined to attack Brest, bore down for Camaret Bay, under the com∣mand of the Lord Berkley. Nine hundred men were landed, in a disorderly manner, on the eighth of June, under the fire of some men of war. The bay was lined with entrenchments, which were full of the French marines. The English having, for some time, sustained the fire of the enemy, suffered much and were forced to fly. To add to the misfortune, it was now ebbing tide, and several boats were left dry on the sand. Confusion and slaughter prevailed. Six hundred were slain, many were drowned. Talmash himself received a wound, of which he afterwards died at Plymouth. The ships, which covered the landing, were shattered by the batteries which guarded the shore. One Dutch frigate was sunk, after losing al∣most her whole crew. The French had profited so much by the intelligence of Marlborough, that the English chose to return, without any further attempt, to their own coast<NOTE N="Y" PLACE="foot">Burnet. Marq. of Caermarthen's Journal.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This disgrace at sea was not repaired by any splendid advantage obtained by land. The French, standing on the defensive, in Flanders, amused William, with dextrous movements, throughout the summer. With scarce half the force of the allies, the Dauphin, assist∣ed by the Mareschal de Luxembourg, covered from insult the French lines. The King was forced to re∣main in a state of inactivity, with the finest army he
<PB N="65" REF="78"/>
had ever brought into the field. The rapid move∣ment of the French from Vignamont, was the most signal event of the whole campaign. Having march∣ed forty leagues, in four days, they formed an impe∣netrable line, from the Lys to the ocean; and pre∣vented William from attacking, by land, the maritime places, which his fleet had insulted by sea. He, how∣ever, found means to besiege and take the town and castle of Huy. He ended the campaign with this exploit; and left the army, on the thirtieth of Sep∣tember. To stop the progress of the King, on the side of Flanders, was deemed equal to a victory by the court of Versailles. The confederates had never a nearer prospect of success. But their hopes were defeated, by the abilities of the Mareschal de Lux∣embourg<NOTE N="Z" PLACE="foot">Hist. de France, vol. iii. Kennet. Ralph.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">In Spain.</NOTE> While the war languished in Flanders, the French pushed their operations, with vigour, on the side of Spain. In Catalonia, the Mareschal de Noailles, having forced the passage of the river Ter, defeated the Spanish army entrenched on the further shore. He took Palamos, by assault, on the seventh of June. Gironne and Ostalric fell successively into his hands. His designs upon Barcelona were defeated, by the ar∣rival of Russel, with the combined fleet, in the neigh∣bouring seas. Tourville, with his squadron, was blocked up in the port of Toulon. The absence of their ships stopt the progress of the French. But a panic had seized the King, and shaken the councils of Spain. The Queen-mother, a daughter of Austria, and devoted to the views of her family, prevented Charles the second from soliciting peace, on advan∣tageous terms. Intrigue, jealousy, and even murder prevailed at court. The Queen-mother gained the young Queen, by supporting her supposed lover, the Baron de Perlis. The Duke d'Ossona, who alone re∣mained faithful to the interest of his master, was poi∣soned; and the public measures were distracted, be∣tween
<PB N="66" REF="79"/>
the feeble efforts of a weak monarch and a faction devoted to the court of Vienna<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Hist. d'Espagne, tom. ii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Other mili∣tary trans∣actions.</NOTE> In Piedmont, the campaign was inactive. Nothing of moment happened upon the Upper-Rhine. The Duke of Savoy was employed in secret negociations with France. The Emperor made his chief effort, on the side of Hungary. The war, in that country, produced no striking event. But the Poles, in alliance with the Imperialists, defeated the Tartars on the Neister in the month of October<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">Oct. 26.</NOTE>. The operati∣ons of the combined fleets in the ocean, after the fruitless attempt upon Brest, were either languid or ill-directed. The lord Berkley bombarded Diep<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">Ju¦ly 12.</NOTE>, with some effect. He was not equally successful at Havre. He proceeded from thence to La Hogue and Cherbourg. But his progress was more a matter of parade than service. William, anxious to make an impression on France, on the side of Flanders, had recommended an attempt upon Dunkirk and Calais, in the course of the summer. A squadron, under the command of Sir Cloudsley Shovel, and subject to the directions of one Meesters, a Dutchman, came be∣fore the first of those places, on the twelfth of Sep∣tember. This man had invented a machine, which from the fury of its discharge, was called the <HI>Infernal.</HI> Two of these machines were sent in against the fort, which guarded the Risbank. The first blew up with∣out effect; the latter spent its effect on itself, and was destroyed. The attempt on Calais<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">July 19.</NOTE> was equally unsuccessful; and thus the naval campaign, in the ocean, especially if the expression may be used, pro∣duced neither glory nor advantage to the nation<NOTE N="E" PLACE="foot">Burchit.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">King ar∣rives. Parliament meete.</NOTE> The King, having left the army on the last day of September, repaired to his favourite residence at Loo. On the twenty-third of October, he departed from that place. Having adjusted, at the Hague, the state of the war, for the ensuing year, he set sail from the Maese, on the eighth of November, and landed at Margate the next day. The Queen met him at Ro∣chester;
<PB N="67" REF="80"/>
and they arrived at Kensington on the tenth in the evening, amidst the acclamations of the popu∣lace. The parliament, after repeated prorogations, met on the twelfth at Westminster. The King in∣formed them in his speech, that he was glad to meet them in such a good posture of the public affairs. He told them, that the enemy had not been in a con∣dition to meet the fleet, in these seas. That the great force sent into the Mediterranean, had broken all their designs in Spain; and that an effectual stop had been put to the progress of the French arms, on the side of Flanders. He doubted not, he said, neither their affection for his person, nor their zeal for the public service. He, therefore, demanded such sup∣plies as might enable him to prosecute the war with that vigour, which was the only means for procuring peace. He put them in mind, that the act of tonnage and poundage was to expire at Christmas; and that the great anticipations had rendered that revenue ne∣cessary for the support of the crown<NOTE N="F" PLACE="foot">Journals, Nov. 12.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A supply granted.</NOTE> The commons, declining to proceed to business, adjourned themselves for seven days. The plan of government was either not settled, or the heads of the opposing party were to be sounded and gained. A bill for frequent parliaments, which has since obtained the name of the triennial bill, seems to have been the price of the demanded supplies. The absolute ne∣cessity of a frequency of parliaments had been assert∣ed, in the declaration of rights. But the demands of the subject, on this important point, had been express∣ed in such indefinite terms, that they had been hitherto eluded with ease, by the crown.

Two millions and near four hun∣dred thousand pounds were granted for the service of the navy<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot">Dec. 3.</NOTE>; and the like sum to support the army, throughout the ensuing year. The house voted, that

the subsidies of tonnage and poundage, which expired on the twenty-fourth of December, should begin from the twenty-sixth, and continue for five years. The discontinuing of these duties, for one day, was in∣tended to prevent the pretence of prescription, on the side of the crown, for revenues, which ought to be considered as the free gift of the subject.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Triennial bill.</NOTE> The King came to the house of lords, on the twen∣ty-second of December, and gave the royal assent to the triennial bill. Two reasons<NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. iii.</NOTE> seem to have combined, to induce William to give his concurrence to an act, which he had defeated the preceding year. The commons, he found, were resolved to receive this concession from the crown, as the price of a sup∣ply for the war. Besides, the Queen had been taken ill of the small-pox, the day before, with incurable symptoms of that dangerous disease. He was unwil∣ling, therefore, by an exertion of the prerogative, to shake his influence with the nation; which would ne∣cessarily be weakened by the event of her death. His prudence only could, in this instance, overcome his attachment to what he deemed to be the inherent right of the crown. The commons, however, in as∣serting the liberties of the subject, appeared not to have neglected themselves. In the second clause of the bill, they implied the continuance of the parlia∣ment then subsisting, for three years. This selfish provision was not passed, without censure, in the house of peers. Some lords, at the last reading, pro∣tested against the bill; as tending to the continuance of the present parliament, longer than was agreeable to the constitution of England<NOTE N="L" PLACE="foot">Journals of the Lorde Dec. 18.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Death and character of the Queen.</NOTE> The distemper of the Queen, from bad symptoms, advanced rapidly to worse, till it terminated in her death, on the twenty-eighth of December.

was tall and graceful, full proportioned, and easy in all her motions. Though her complexion was not fair, the lineaments of her face were regular and well∣combined. A lively and piercing eye threw such a pleasing light on her countenance, that she even might be called a woman of beauty. The genuine features of her mind are difficult to be traced, as her passions were neither uncommon in their kind nor strong in their degree. A strict attention to her husband, and even an absolute subserviency to his will, seem to have been more the rule of her life, than those more ma∣jestic virtues, which alone could thoroughly justify her political conduct. When she held the reins of government, she displayed more prudence than ability, and less of art than solidity of judgment. Unambiti∣ous in her disposition, and subdued in her youth to obedience, she was ever uneasy under the weight of power; and she always resigned her authority, not only with indifference, but even with pleasure. Her private virtues, in short, were chiefly conjugal. She was not a kind sister. None will say, that she was an affectionate child. Her situation, it must be confessed, was cruel and difficult. It was only through a breach of the ties of nature, she could become at all an object of public applause.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Grief of William.</NOTE> Though William was neither a fond husband, nor subject to feelings of a delicate kind, he exhibited every symptom of an unfeigned grief, upon the death of the Queen. Her amiable manner and an habitual attention to all his commands, had, it seems, made an impression on his mind, which he had not cared to own. Besides, gratitude had, perhaps, supplied the place of a warm affection, in his breast. The Queen certainly deserved every return of friendship, at HIS hands. She had acted, in all respects toward him, as if virtue consisted solely in the implicit obedience of a wife to her husband. Motives of policy might also have joined their force to more tender sentiments, in his mind. The whole popularity of his measures pro∣ceeded from the open and agreeable deportment of Mary. Many considered her as having the only natu∣ral right to the crown. His own manner, when at its
<PB N="70" REF="83"/>
best, procured more respect than affection; and he, therefore, had sufficient reason to lament the loss of a consort, whose influence had so much contributed to reconcile the people to his government. But what∣ever motive weighed most with the mind of William, his prudence might have been trusted, as to the since∣rity of his grief.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Conduct of the Princess of Den∣mark.</NOTE> The city of London, the two houses of parliament, the nation in general expressed, in warm addresses to the throne, their sense of the merit of Mary and their own sorrow. The Princess of Denmark was induced, by the Earl of Sunderland, to send a letter of con∣dolence, on the death of her sister, to the King. This Princess, even before her disgrace, in the year 1692, had begun a secret correspondence with her fa∣ther. But having, now, obtained a nearer prospect of the crown, she was easily induced to adopt an appear∣ance of reconciliation with William. His prudence dictated, that he ought to meet her half-way. He was apprehensive, that she might carry her resent∣ment for former injuries to a pitch that might prove uneasy to his government, if not dangerous to his pow∣er. She was the next heir, by act of parliament. She was nearer than William himself, by the title of blood. He was sensible, that many had been restrained, by their deference to Mary, as the daughter of the late King; and he was certain, that, at least, the dis∣contented would pay their court, with more diligence to the Princess, should he permit her to remain in a state of proscription from his favour. He, therefore, admitted her into his presence, presented her with most of her sister's jewels, and conferred upon her some other favours; more from political views than any affection for her person<NOTE N="M" PLACE="foot">Burnet.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections of James, on the death of Mary.</NOTE> Mary was scarcely considered as a partner in the re∣gal authority, during her life.

The late King declined to make any ef∣forts for his restoration, upon the present occasion. He conceived hopes, that a government, which, he thought, depended upon the popularity of his daugh∣ter, would shake and unhinge itself by her decease. He was much affected by the intelligence. But his sorrow was more that of an enthusiast than a father. He was rather grieved at her manner of dying, than at her death. <Q REND="inline">"The King,"</Q> said that unfortunate Prince, <Q REND="inline">"received this additional affliction to those which he had already undergone. He saw a child, whom he tenderly loved, persevering to her death, in a signal state of disobedience and disloyalty. He per∣ceived, that she was extolled for a crime as for the highest merit. He heard her contradictions called virtues; and her breach of duty to a parent a becom∣ing sacrifice to her religion and her country<NOTE N="O" PLACE="foot">James H. 1694.</NOTE>."</Q> Such were the reflections of James, upon the death of a daughter, whose behaviour to a parent could scarce be justified, by his own conduct.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceedings of parlia∣ment</NOTE> The death of the Queen, though alarming to the nation, interrupted not the course of business in par∣liament. A remarkable transaction, in the preceding summer and autumn, was laid before the commons, early in the present session. One Lunt, a person of a very profligate character, who had once been a day∣labourer at Highgate, gave information, on the fif∣teenth of June, concerning a plot for levying war against the government. He affirmed, that he had delivered commissions from the late King to several gentlemen in Lancashire and Cheshire. That, at their instance and expence, he had bought arms and enlisted men. That he had been twice sent to France. to receive the commands of James concerning the in∣tended insurrection; and that one Wilson, who had assisted him in delivering the commissions, was privy to the circumstances of the plot. The supposed con∣spirators were seized. They were brought to Lon∣don, and then remanded to Manchester, to take their trials. Lunt and Wilson swore to the truth of the in∣formation.
<PB N="72" REF="85"/>
But Lunt, being ordered in court, to point at the several prisoners, mistook his men. This created a violent suspicion of perjury; and, at the in∣stant, one Taffe, who had been acquainted with Lunt, declared publickly, that the whole plot was no∣thing but a villanous contrivance, fabricated between himself and that profligate witness. The King's coun∣cil stopt all proceedings. The prisoners were acquit∣ted; and the popular clamour became so loud in fa∣vour of the accused, that the ministry found it neces∣sary to commit their witnesses to prison, and to order them to be prosecuted<NOTE N="P" PLACE="foot">Trial. Kennet. vol. iii. Ralph. vol. ii. Auct cirat. passim.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">on the Lan∣cashire plot.</NOTE> Though the most of the persons accused were at∣tached to the late King, and some of them actually plotting for his service, the information of Lunt and his associates seems to have had no foundation in fact. The whole appears to have been framed by the in∣trigues and precipitate zeal of one Johnston, a Scots∣man, brother to the secretary of state of that name. This busy and self-interested man, had, in the hopes of a gratification from William, long acted the part of an informer against the Jacobites, in England as well as in Scotland. He had employed every mean art to circumvent the unwary, and to find evidence against the accused<NOTE N="Q" PLACE="foot">Johnston's Letters to Carstares</NOTE>. The victory obtained by the gentlemen of Lancashire over the witnesses of go∣vernment, in a court of justice, induced them to lay their grievances before the parliament. The result of the deliberations of the commons answered not their hopes on the subject. They voted, that there had been sufficient grounds for the prosecution and trial of the conspirators at Manchester; and that a dangerous plot had been carried on against the King and govern∣ment. Notwithstanding these resolutions, the wit∣nesses were tried and found guilty of perjury, at the Lancaster assizes. They were afterwards<NOTE N="R" PLACE="foot">Aug. 1695.</NOTE> indicted, for a conspiracy against the lives and estates of the ac∣cused

gentlemen. But the prosecution was dropt, and Lunt and Wilson were discharged.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An inquiry into abuses.</NOTE> The popularity of passing the triennial bill into a law, secured not William from an opposition in parlia∣ment. The commons ordered a state of the loans, debts, and charges upon the revenue, together with an account of the expence of the civil list, to be laid before their house<NOTE N="S" PLACE="foot">Journals, January 12th.</NOTE>. They opened, the same day, a channel of inquiry into abuses and corruptions, which led to important but disgraceful discoveries of the ve∣nality of the times. Upon a petition of the inhabi∣tants of Royston, against the violence and exactions of the soldiery, the house came to some spirited votes. They resolved, that the officers and soldiers, demand∣ing and exacting subsistence-money in their quarters, or on a march, was arbitrary and illegal; and a great violation of the rights of the subjects. Some agents who, by defrauding the soldiers of their pay, had forced them into violences, were committed by the command of the house. Guy, secretary of the trea∣sury, the known instrument of the crown, in purchasing yotes in parliament, was sent to the Tower for taking a bribe for himself<NOTE N="T" PLACE="foot">Ibid. Feb. 1695.</NOTE>. They addressed the King against colonel Hastings, for his acts of avarice and violence against his regiment; and that officer was in∣stantly discharged from his command. A bill was or∣dered, in the mean time, to oblige the agents of the regiments to account for the disposal of the money which they had received<NOTE N="U" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The speak∣er expelled for corrupti∣on.</NOTE> This detection of flagrant abuses, established a well∣founded opinion, that the court, the camp, the city, and even the parliament, were infected with one ge∣neral contagion of bribery, corruption and venality. The commons, to extricate themselves from their part of the aspersion, resolved to proceed in their inquiry. The unsuccessful attempts made by the city of Lon∣don, to carry the orphans' bill into a law, and the fa∣cility with which it had been lately passed, created sus∣picious of corrupt practices upon that head. A com∣mittee
<PB N="74" REF="87"/>
<MILESTONE N="1695" UNIT="year"/> was appointed to inspect the chamberlain's books. They made their report, on the seventh of March. Several sums of money appeared to have been expended in gaining votes in parliament. The line of corruption was traced to the speaker himself. The house went immediately into debate on the sub∣ject. They soon came to the resolution, <Q REND="inline">"That Sir John Trevor, speaker of the house, by receiving a gratuity of one thousand guineas from the city of Lon∣don, after passing the orphans' bill, was guilty of a high crime and misdemeanour."</Q> He had the morti∣fication to put this humiliating question to the house. He retired under the pretence of a colick. He signi∣fied his demission to the King; and was expelled from his seat in parliament<NOTE N="V" PLACE="foot">Journals, March 1695.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Corrupt practices in India affairs,</NOTE> The commons, from this shameful scene of detecti∣on, turned their inquiries to another quarter. The affairs of the East-India company had employed a great portion of the attention of parliament, from the year 1691, till the end of 1693. The company had declined to submit to the regulations proposed by the commons. They even frustrated all the endeavours of that assembly, by procuring a new charter from the King. The house suspected corruption, upon the pre∣sent occasion; and they ordered the same committee who had examined the books of the chamberlain, to inspect those of the East-India company. The ab∣stracts of the sums paid for special services, since the Revolution, soon led to the discovery so much requir∣ed. In the reign of James, the annual charges scarce exceeded twelve hundred pounds. Ever since they had gradually increased. In the year 1691, they were very considerable. But in the year 1693, when the charter was obtained, they amounted to near ninety thousand pounds; which had been lent on the notes of Sir Thomas Cooke, the governor of the com∣pany. Cooke was called before the house. He resus∣ed to account for the money. He was immediately committed to the Tower; and a bill ordered to be brought in to oblige him to make a discovery. The
<PB N="75" REF="88"/>
bill passed, in a few days, and was sent up to the lords for their concurrence<NOTE N="W" PLACE="foot">Journals, March 26, 1695.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">detected</NOTE> The Duke of Leeds, so often mentioned by the progressive titles of Sir Thomas Osborne, the Lord Latimer, the Earl of Danby, and Marquis of Caermar∣then, by the vehemence of his zeal for Cooke, ren∣dered his own honour suspected. The protestations of his innocence, with which he blended his speech a∣gainst the bill, were considered as so many acknow∣ledgments of guilt, in a man more remarkable for his talents, than either for his integrity or disinterested∣ness. The house yielding either to his arguments or influence, postponed the business from the sixth to the thirteenth of April; a point of consequence, as the session was known to draw near to its close. Cooke was brought before the lords, on the thirteenth. He declared himself willing to make a full discovery, on condition of being indemnified against all actions and suits except those of the East-India company, whom he had never injured. The peers resolved to drop the bill of pains and penalties, sent up from the commons; and they ordered a committee to withdraw to form such a bill of indemnification as Cooke required. The commons amended the bill with a penal clause. The lords agreed to the amendment; and Cooke was di∣rected, by the act, to make a full discovery to a joint committee of peers and commons, on or before the twenty-third of April<NOTE N="X" PLACE="foot">Journals passim.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">by the com∣mons.</NOTE> Some, in both houses, were eager in the prosecu∣tion of the affair. But, from the loss of time, the majority seemed determined to defeat a measure, which common decency forbade them to drop entirely. The King himself appeared to be no great friend to a discovery, which threatened to involve himself in the same scene of corruption with his servants. When he came to the house, on the twenty-second of April, to pass several bills, he recommended dispatch to his par∣liament; as he was determined to put an end to the session in a few days. The joint committee of lords and commons met at the exchequer chamber. Cooke
<PB N="76" REF="89"/>
appeared before them, and delivered a paper, contain∣ing an unsatisfactory discovery. Several persons pri∣vy to the transaction were examined. Ten thousand pounds were traced to the King; five thousand to the Duke of Leeds, and other sums to other men in power. The scene of corruption appeared to be as extensive, as it was shameful and uncommon. The matter was reported, on the twenty-seventh of April, to both houses. The commons, in particular, flew into a vio∣lent flame. The innocent were eager to shew their own regard to honour. The consciously criminal er∣deavoured to palliate their guilt, by an appearance of vehemence against the crime<NOTE N="Y" PLACE="foot">Journals, passim.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dake of Leeds im∣peached.</NOTE> The commons, after some debate, came to a reso∣lution, that there was sufficient matter to impeach the Duke of Leeds of high crimes and misdemeanours. They ordered Mr. Comptroller Wharton to impeach him accordingly at the bar of the house of lords, in the name of the house and all the commons of Eng∣land. The report was read, in the mean time, in the house of lords. Leeds was speaking to his own defence, when he was apprized of the proceedings of the commons. He suddenly went down to the house, and desired to be heard. He was permitted to speak. But his speech was not satisfactory. He prepared for his defence in a more effectual way. One Robart, a Swiss by nation, and one of his own domestics, was the only person who could carry home any certain proof to the Duke. Robart was prudently sent back to his native country. The lords addressed the King to stop the fugitive, by shutting the ports of the king∣dom against his flight. Neither William nor his ser∣vants were likely to gain by the inquiry. The procla∣mation was not issued till nine days after the address of the peers. The clamours of Leeds for a trial or an ac∣quittal, rose in proportion to Robart's distance from London. A prorogation, on the third of May, at length extinguished the inquiry and the Duke's fears. Thus ended a wretched farce; in which the feeble efforts for obtaining justice, were searce less disgrace∣ful than venality itself to the age<NOTE N="Z" PLACE="foot">Journals, passim.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="90"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An act with regard to the coin.</NOTE> During these transactions, another matter of the ut∣most importance employed a part of the attention of parliament. The bad state of the coin, both by di∣minution and adulteration, became too obvious not to alarm the nation. The money had actually decreased more than one half, in its nominal value. The King had been, for some time, apprized of this growing evil<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol, iii.</NOTE>. He intended to issue a proclamation, that no money should pass, for the future, but by weight. He was, however, diverted from this measure, by the consideration, that the debasement of the coin would facilitate the loans to government. The Earl of Rochester laid open, in the house of lords, the alarming condition of the currency; and as early as the eighth of January, a committee of the commons were appointed to receive proposals to prevent clipping, and the exportation of silver. The report of the com∣mittee lay, for some time, neglected on the table. The lords, however, passed a bill to prevent the coun∣terfeiting and clipping the current coin of the kingdom. They sent the bill down to the commons for their con∣currence, on the nineteenth of March<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">Journals, March 19, 1695.</NOTE>. The house took the report of their committee into consi∣deration; and they made several amendments, to which the lords agreed. But though the bill contain∣ed some good clauses, it was manifestly inadequate to the perfect cure of the evil. The value of money was sunk in the exchange. Guineas, which ought to have been equal in value to one and twenty shillings and six pence, rose to thirty shillings. The credit of government and the public funds sunk to such a de∣gree, <Q REND="inline">"as to bring a discount of forty per cent. upon tallies<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. iii.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Parliament protogued.</NOTE> The just complaints of the English mariners, had induced William to recommend a bill for their encou∣ragement, at the opening of this session of parliament.

The Dutch, to man their own fleet, exacted, under the pretence of the King's permission, the tenth man out of every British ship that entered their ports. They rose in their demands in the course of the present year. They required a man out of eve∣ry vessel, though navigated by ever so few hands. The person chosen was either obliged to redeem his freedom with a considerable sum of money, or to serve in a foreign bottom<NOTE N="E" PLACE="foot">Dutch Encroachments P. 53 MS.

The Mare∣schal de Villeroi was at length placed at the head of the principal army in Flanders. The second army was submitted to the orders of De Boufflers. Namur on the right, and Dunkirk on the left, comprehended
<PB N="79" REF="92"/>
between them, the extent of country to be defended by the French. Tournay on the Schelde, and Ypres near the Lys, formed a part of the line. De Bouf∣flers was ordered to assemble his army near Mons, to cover Namur. Villeroi posted himself between the Schelde and the Lys, to protect Tournay, Ypres, and Dunkirk<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot">Mem. du Feuquiere, p. 120.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Preparati∣ons against Namar.</NOTE> William, having taken the field, on the sixth of June, found himself at the head of an army, much superior to that of the French. To amuse the enemy, and to conceal his real design upon Namur, he made some movements, which rendered Villeroi uncertain where the storm was first to fall. The King assembled his army in three divisions. The first, under the Elector of Bavaria, he ordered to advance between the Schelde and the Lys. He posted himself, with the second, at Becelaër on the Heule. He detached the Duke of Wirtemberg, with the third division, to invest the fort of Knoque. These feints and refine∣ments in his motions, the King durst not have at∣tempted, had De Luxembourg still commanded the enemy. Any of the three bodies of the allies might have been attacked by the whole force of the French army. But either Villeroi discerned not the advan∣tage, or he deliberated till the opportunity was lost<NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>; and William, having at length completed his prepara∣tions, resolved to sit down before Namur. He made every necessary disposition for investing the place, for covering the siege, and for forming an army to observe the motions of the enemy, on the maritime side of Flanders.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The town invested.</NOTE> The siege of Namur was formed by the Elector of Bavaria, with his native troops, the forces of several German princes, and a body of cavalry. William, at the head of the main army, lay behind the Mehaigne, in a condition to pass that river, and, if necessary, to sustain the siege. The Prince of Vaudemont, with an army of observation, lay between the Lys and the Mandel, to cover those places in Flanders which were

most exposed<NOTE N="L" PLACE="foot">Memoires du Feuquiere.</NOTE>. The enemy perceiving, at length, the designs of William upon Namur, the Mareschal de Boufflers, with seven regiments of dragoons, threw himself into the place, to reinforce the garrison. Ville∣roi, instead of making any attempt to relieve Namur, resolved to fall upon the Prince of Vaudemont, who lay, with an inferior force, within three leagues of his army. The prince was disadvantageously encamp∣ed. His adversary, however, possessed no abilities to avail himself of what fortune had thrown in his way. When he deliberated, concerning the manner of at∣tack, the opportunity was lost. The like advantage presented itself a second time. But it was only to throw a second disgrace on the French general. The Prince retreated in his presence, with consummate skill; and sheltered himself, with very little loss, un∣der the cannon of Ghent<NOTE N="M" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Operations.</NOTE> The fine retreat of the Prince of Vaudemont, was considered equal to a victory. The French, however, found means to take Dixmuyde and Deynse, with little resistance. The garrisons were made prisoners of war. Both places were dismantled. The trenches were, in the mean time, opened before Namur. On the twelfth of July the batteries began to play. In a sally, on the eighteenth, the French were forced to retreat, with considerable loss. The King, on the same day, ordered the advanced works and traverses of the enemy to be stormed. This service was per∣formed in his presence, with the greatest resolution and success. The ground taken from the enemy, was instantly occupied with batteries. On the twenty-seventh of July, the King carried the first counter∣scarp; and the Elector of Bavaria, at the same in∣stant, found means to throw a bridge across the Sam∣bre, which facilitated the reduction of the place. The French behaved themselves with an obstinate bravery. But the allies, animated by the presence of their leader, were irresistible in their various attacks. The out∣works were, at length, carried by the besiegers. A practicable breach was made in the innermost wall.

Preparations for a general assalut being made, the town capitulated, on the fourth of August. The gar∣rison, under the command of the Mareschal de Bouf∣flers, retired, on the sixth, to the castle<NOTE N="N" PLACE="foot">Journal of the siege.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The citadel capitulates.</NOTE> The Mareschal de Villeroi, in the mean time, hav∣ing crossed the Lys and Schelde, made a feint of marching to raise the siege. His real design was di∣rected against Brussels; and he appeared, on the thirteenth of August, before that place. Under a pre∣tence of revenging the attacks of the English fleet, on the maritime towns of Flanders, he bombarded Brus∣sels. Fifteen hundred houses, and many public build∣ings were laid in ruins. The Prince of Vaudemont was an eye-witness of a destruction, which he could neither prevent nor avenge. On the fifteenth of Au∣gust, the French general, being reinforced with a considerable body of troops, directed his march toward Namur. When he had advanced to Fleurus, he gave a signal of his approach to the besieged, by the dis∣charge of ninety pieces of cannon. William, leaving the charge of the siege to the Elector of Bavaria, re∣paired to his army, strongly encamped within five miles of Namur. On the twenty-ninth of August, De Villeroi advanced toward the allies. But he found them so well posted, that he retired in the night, without noise. The castle was, in the mean time, pressed by the allies with the utmost vigour. In a general assault, on the thirtieth of August, the be∣siegers, though with great loss, made such a lodge∣ment, that the French desired to capitulate, on the first of September<NOTE N="O" PLACE="foot">Journal of the siege.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections.</NOTE> The taking of Namur, in the presence of a great army of the enemy, was the most brilliant of Wil∣liam's military actions. Though he had lost that im∣portant place, in the like circumstances, his spirit and conduct throughout this campaign, deserved and re∣ceived applause. An act of resentment against the enemy, added to the reputation which the King ac∣quired by the taking of Namur. The French, con∣trary to an express cartel for a mutual ransom of pri∣soners,
<PB N="82" REF="95"/>
had detained the garrisons of Dixmuyde and Deynse, which places had fallen into their hands. The Mareschal de Boufflers was arrested as a hostage, by the orders of the King. He remonstrated in vain. He was sent prisoner to Maestricht, and detained till assurances were received, that the imprisoned garrisons should be released and sent back to the allies. The operations of the campaign ended with the surrender of the citadel. William quitted the field and retired to Dieren, and from thence to Loo. The command devolved upon the Elector of Bavaria. But the ar∣mies separated, in the end of September. His want of success, in the preceding years of the war, enhanc∣ed to William the fame of taking Namur.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Campaign in Italy, Germany, and Spain,</NOTE> The war languished, on the side of Italy, between France and the Duke of Savoy. Casal was defended by the first and taken by the latter, in a manner, that shewed neither power was sincere in the operations of the campaign. To amuse the allies seemed to be the object of both parties. The same langour, or ra∣ther a total inaction, prevailed on the Upper-Rhine. Two armies, alternately offering and declining battle, made a mere pastime and parade of war. The Spa∣niards, aided by the maritime powers, were more for∣tunate than they had been in the preceding campaign. They obtained some advantage in the field. But they besieged Palamos in vain. The English fleet, which had wintered at Cadiz, could render no effectual aid to a nation labouring under feeble councils, a want of money, and every species of domestic decay. Admi∣ral Russel, having spent the summer to little purpose, on the coasts of Spain and Provence, returned to ca∣diz, in the end of September. The glory of insulting the French coast, and of confining the fleet of the enemy in the harbour of Toulon, could scarce balance the extraordinary expence of the maritime powers, in their efforts to second the feeble operations in Spain.</P>

A peace had been expected, on the side of Hunga∣ry. But the hopes of the allies vanished, upon the ac∣cession<NOTE N="P" PLACE="foot">Jan. 24, 1695.</NOTE> of Mustapha the Second, to the Ottoman throne. This Prince, possessed of more vigour than his predecessor, Ahmed the Second, resolved to com∣mand his troops in person. He took the field. He passed the Danube. He stormed Lippa. He seized Itul. Falling suddenly on a considerable body of troops under General Veterani, he killed that officer, dispersed his forces, and closed, with success, a cam∣paign which promised nothing but misfortunes. The Elector of Saxony, who commanded the Imperialists, was too late in taking the field. His army was ill pro∣vided, the season was severe, the enemy too prudent to hazard that reputation which he had already ac∣quired. Poland, torn as usual with domestic faction, made no figure in the present year. France had in∣creased, by her intrigues, the feuds between the no∣bles. She had gained, by her secret influence, the King.

Heats and animosities prevail∣ed between the English and Dutch. Complaints were made on every side. Meesters withdrew from the squadron, with his machines, in the night.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of Scotland.</NOTE> The affairs of Scotland furnished nothing worthy of being recorded, after the prorogation of the parlia∣ment, in the year 1693. The same regency and the same measures continued throughout the succeeding year. The King, eager to derive all the possible aid from that kingdom, to maintain the war, demanded numerous levies, from the heritors or proprietors of lands. In the space of three months, three thousand men were impressed and delivered to the officers of the government. These with five regiments, making in all seven thousand soldiers, were embarked at Leith<NOTE N="U" PLACE="foot">Apr. 22, 1694.</NOTE>, and transported to Flanders. The surren∣der<NOTE N="V" PLACE="foot">Apr. 21, 1694.</NOTE> of the Bass, which had been hitherto held in the name of James, is a matter of greater singularity than importance. Two and thirty persons had taken possession of that post and supported themselves by manning their boat and rifling such vessels as passed near their rock. In one of their predatory excursions, eighteen of their number, having boarded a ship from Dunbar, were carried to Dundee, by the force of a storm. They landed, and fled, by different ways<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A session of parliament.</NOTE> The malcontents in Scotland found matter for fo∣menting a jealousy of government, which rendered the meeting of the parliament of that kingdom dange∣rous to the authority of its regency. That assembly, therefore, was prorogued, from time to time, till the necessities of the crown overcame the fears of its ser∣vants. The funds established for the army had ex∣pired; and they had been diverted to other purposes, by a breach of public faith. To soften the opposition to the crown, a commission was issued, under the great seal, to examine witnesses upon the massacre of Glen∣co; as the memory of that act of barbarity still in∣flamed the passions of the whole nation. Though this was an artifice to cover that infamous transaction, by a private inquiry<NOTE N="X" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. iii. p. 156.</NOTE>, it produced, by an appearance of justice, a favourable change in the minds of the people. But schemes, still more effectual, had been previously formed to amuse the nation, and to gain a majority in parliament. On the ninth of May 1695, the session was opened, by the Marquis of Tweedale, as King's commissioner. William, in his letter to the parliament, excused, by the continuation of the war, his not appearing in person in Scotland. He recom∣mended to them moderation and union, in matters of the church. He desired, in the most soothing terms, a renewal of the subsidies, that had just expired<NOTE N="Y" PLACE="foot">King's Letter.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The mem∣bers gained.</NOTE> Soothing expressions, however, were not the only means prepared, by the servants of William, to gain the Scots. One Paterson, who had been the chief instrument in establishing the bank of England, had framed a mercantile project of an extensive kind for Scotland. Such English merchants, as had been hi∣therto disappointed in their schemes of forming a new
<PB N="86" REF="99"/>
East India company, gave their countenance to Pa∣terson's plan; which, from views of their own, was adopted, with ardour, by the Scottish ministry. The project was to establish one settlement at Darien, on the east side of the isthmus of America; and another on the opposite side, toward the South Sea. This scheme was laid before the King, by secretary John∣ston. Instructions were prepared and signed, im∣powering the commissioner to give his assent to any bill for the encouragement of trade. That nobleman, accordingly, communicated the King's intentions to the parliament. The bait was greedily seized. The people lost their resentment, in a condescension, which flattered their hopes of wealth. The parliament it∣self was all submission. A vote of condolence, for the death of the Queen, was instantly passed. They gave, at once, all the necessary supplies. The ways and means were a general poll-tax, a six-months cess out of the land-rents, and an additional excise<NOTE N="Z" PLACE="foot">Proceedings of Scot. Parl.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceedings</NOTE> But notwithstanding this seeming complaisance to the crown, the current of the nation, for an inquiry into the massacre of Glenco, was too strong to be op∣posed. The artifice of the court-party could not con∣ceal the shocking circumstances of that barbarous af∣fair. They, however, diverted, with some appear∣ance of decency, the implication of guilt, from the King himself to Dalrymple, his acting minister upon that occasion. The parliament voted the whole a murder. They addressed the King, for justice, on the offenders. But their application was couched in terms, which seemed to demand no compliance with their request. William, accordingly, paid no atten∣tion to their address. He even continued his favour, without abatement, to the principal actors in the tra∣gedy. The bill for establishing a company for trad∣ing to Africa and the Indies, was the price of the blood shed at Glenco. The clamour and misfortunes which this act produced, shall be hereafter explained. To∣gether with this bill, two others of importance receiv∣ed the royal assent: An act for raising yearly nine

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of Ireland.</NOTE> A kind of tranquillity succeeded, in Ireland the in∣effectual complaints, which the people of that king∣dom laid before the parliament of England.

Capel abetted the interests of the English against the old Irish, with∣out any strict regard to equity<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. iii.</NOTE>. He courted po∣pularity at the expence of justice, and suffered himself to become the property of interested and designing men. His brethren in office were more severe and more just. They studied to protect the old Irish, when oppressed<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. They gained honour. But they lost popularity. Capel, favoured by the Eng∣lish in Ireland, raised his views to the government of that kingdom.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A session of parliament.</NOTE> Capel opened the session with a demand of money. The commons resolved to grant an immediate supply to the King, to discharge the debts of the crown, and to maintain the established government. They found it less difficult to make the grant, than to find the ways and means. They agreed, at length, on a poll∣bill, and some additional customs. But as both were deemed inadequate to the sum required, they resolved to continue, to the end of the year 1698, the additi∣onal excise, which they had voted at the beginning only for a short space of time. A quarrel between the lord-deputy and the chancellor, filled the rest of
<PB N="88" REF="101"/>
the session with debates, and a degree of confusion. A motion was made by the party of the former, to impeach the latter for forming a new faction in the kingdom. But the chancellor was cleared of all im∣putation by a great majority. The session, however, ended in tranquillity; and, upon the whole, favoura∣ble to the lord-deputy. He carried the projects of the Crown in parliament; and he was recommended as an excellent governor, in a special address sent by the commons to the King<NOTE N="F" PLACE="foot">Address of the Commons.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Inactivity of the late King.</NOTE> Though the death of Mary raised the expectations of the adherents of her father, that Prince shewed little inclination to avail himself of that event. He either resigned a mind, depressed with misfortunes, to religious enthusiasm; or, disgusted with the appa∣rent coldness of the French ministry, left his hopes of a restoration to fortune. His friends in England ceased not, however, to urge him to an attempt on that kingdom. The Earl of Arran endeavoured to rouze him with letters. The Earl of Sunderland, now much in the confidence of William, betrayed the councils of the latter Prince to his former master<NOTE N="G" PLACE="foot">Arran to James March 13, 1695.</NOTE>. He in∣formed the late King, early in the season, that the English fleet were destined to attack Toulon. But he, at the same time, gave it as his opinion, that the en∣terprise would be dropt as impracticable<NOTE N="H" PLACE="foot">Sunderland's Correspondence Scot. Coll. Paris.</NOTE>. The langour which had seized the belligerent powers, ex∣tended itself to the party of James in England, and to his councils in France.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Zeal of his adherents.</NOTE> The more violent Jacobites, in the mean time, con∣tinued their zealous efforts in favour of their dethroned master. Strangers to the situation of the mind of James, and ignorant of the disposition of France, they endeavoured to rouze the first with every possible ar∣gument, to make a descent in England. The absence of the reigning Prince, his unpopularity at home, and
<PB N="89" REF="102"/>
the feuds which subsisted between him and some mem∣bers of the great alliance abroad, were placed in the most flattering colours before the eyes of the late King. The manifest decline in the health of William, his loss of influence by the death of Mary, the distress and consequent discontent of the nation, their murmurs against the late heavy taxes, their fears of future bur∣dens, were either magnified or recounted with ardour. James was assured, by his adherents, that, in the pre∣tent state of affairs and opinions, ten thousand men would be sufficient to establish him again on his throne. They affirmed, that the whole force in England, con∣sisted only of nine thousand men. That the nation was divided into three parties. That one of these was in the interest of the late King; one affected the views and person of the Princess of Denmark; and the third, but the least considerable, adhered to William<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1695.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His party increases in England.</NOTE> Whilst these zealots laid their proposals with so much eagerness before James, his minister, the Earl of Middleton, maintained an intimate intercourse with the principal men in England. The Earl of Sunder∣land continued his secret correspondence. Even the Duke of Devonshire and the Earl of Pembroke<NOTE N="J" PLACE="foot">Middleton to Mordant, June 6, 1695.</NOTE>, the latter then lord-privy-seal, seemed to have listen∣ed to the court of St. Germains. The Dutchess of Devonshire, either following or leading her husband, became an agent for James<NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. The Princess of Denmark, and the Earl of Marlborough professed themselves his firm and unshaken friends. The assu∣rances made by persons of such weight and conse∣quence, kept alive the hopes of his friends, while he himself had fallen into a state of indifference con∣cerning his own fate<NOTE N="L" PLACE="foot">James II. 1695.</NOTE>. Middleton, however, made, soon after, fruitless applications, in the name of his master, to the court of France. To induce the French ministry to undertake an invasion of England, he com∣municated his intelligence and hopes from that king∣dom. He represented, that the coast was left naked of ships of war. That the discontents which prevail∣ed

at present, were likely to increase, after the in∣tended elections for a new house of commons. Wil∣liam, he said, was to demand eight millions from par∣liament; and to alter the established succession, by preferring any children he might hereafter beget, to the Princess of Denmark and her son. But Middleton built most on the credit of Sunderland; "who," he continued, <Q REND="inline">"had been always the first to deceive him∣self, and the foremost to hetray others."</Q></P>

France, exhausted by domestic calamities, as well as by the waste occasioned by a burdensome war, was an∣xious to obtain peace upon any decent terms. The court of Rome itself had forgot the orthodoxy of James, in his pusillanimity in quitting his dominions without a blow. The success of William, in seizing the throne of England, his inflexible perseverance in all his plans, his courage in the field, his apparent prudence in the cabinet, his former obstinacy in con∣tinuing an unsuccessful war, and, at length, the repu∣tation which he acquired in the present campaign, ex∣cited that admiration which invariably follows good fortune. He was, besides, seen through a favourable medium, by the nations of Europe. The haziness which covered him at home, obscured not his lustre abroad. The astonishing exertions of England in the war, were ascribed to his management. He was con∣sidered as the absolute master of Holland; and not only the chain which united the grand confederacy, but even the absolute lord of the members of which it was composed<NOTE N="L" PLACE="foot">Perth's Correspondence, Stuart-papers, 1695.</NOTE>.</P>

The enthusiasm which had deprived him of his throne, was construed into an incurable folly, by the more sensible part of his own persuasion. A kind of WICKED policy, as the Pope, perhaps ludicrously said, had superseded every idea of
<PB N="91" REF="104"/>
religion among the Catholic powers, who were en∣gaged in the grand alliance. Innocent the Twelfth himself, though the sat in St. Peter's chair, was sway∣ed by temporal views, from entertaining any favour for a Prince who had sacrificed his crown to a blind attachment to the Romish faith. He received the Earl of Perth, who had been sent in the character of am∣bassador, by James, with manifest coldness; or treat∣ed him with seeming ridicule. The utmost that the most pressing solicitations could obtain from that Pon∣tiff, amounted only to a compliment. He assured the Earl of Perth, that the would never concur in a peace, which tended to deprive a Catholic Prince of his just rights. But Innocent and all his court were in the interest of the house of Austria; and thus James, though a very faithful son of the church, lost his in∣fluence with the holy Father, through his dependence on France<NOTE N="M" PLACE="foot">Perth's letter, Stuart-papers, 1695.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">King's pro∣gress.</NOTE> William, having spent some time at Loo, repaired to the Hague, on the seventh day of October. Hav∣ing, in an interview with the Elector of Branden∣burg, and in conferences with the States of Holland, settled the operations of the succeeding campaign, he returned to England; and arrived at Kensington, on the twenty-first day of the month. In a council held on the evening of his arrival, he resolved to dissolve the parliament; and to order another to meet, on the twenty-second of November. The Earl of Sunder∣land, in concert with the court of St. Germains, ad∣vised this measure<NOTE N="N" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1695.</NOTE>. The former parliament, from their liberal grants to the Crown, were become odious to the people; and the latter, therefore, were not likely to chuse again representatives so compliant to the views of the King. But William beheld the mat∣ter in another light. The popularity which he thought he derived from the glory of a successful campaign, induced him to hope for a return of members more fa∣vourable to his interest, than those who had lately
<PB N="92" REF="105"/>
pushed their inquiries so far. To improve to his ad∣vantage the present good humour of the people, the King resolved to make a royal progress. But his want of affability, his frigid manner, and dry address, were not calculated either to gain the favour of the populace, or to retain it when gained. A visit which he paid to the Earl of Sunderland at Althorp, was construed, by his enemies, into gratitude for former favours; while his precipitate retreat from Oxford, for fear of being poisoned<NOTE N="O" PLACE="foot">Publications of the times.</NOTE> at an entertainment prepared by the uni∣versity, was considered as unworthy of his known pru∣dence and usual courage.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A new par∣liament.</NOTE> In the elections for the new house of commons, the Jacobites were unsuccessful, in proportion to the decline of their cause. Few of the known adherents of the late King were returned. But the abbetors of the in∣terest of the reigning Prince, were not implicitly chos∣en by the nation. Many of the firmest Whigs were elected: men who made a greater distinction between the principles of government, than between the per∣sons of kings. The two houses met, on the twenty-second of November. Foley, who had succeeded Tre∣vor, in the office of speaker, was again placed by the commons in the chair. The King, in his speech from the throne, demanded the usual supplies, to prosecute with vigour the war. He complained that the funds which had been formerly given, were deficient. He represented that the civil list was in a condition which rendered it impossible for him to subsist, unless that matter should command their immediate care.

supply was voted, a bill was brought in, for regulating trials, in cases of treason and misprision of treason. A bill to the same effect had been often introduced before, and as often disappointed. The adherents of the Court opposed it in its progress. The popularity of the measure, at length, prevailed. By this saluta∣ry law it was provided, that no person should be tried for high treason, except an attempt to assassinate the King, unless the indictment be found within three years after the offence was committed. That the prisoner shall have a copy of the indictment, but not the names of the witnesses, five days, at least, before his arraignment. That he shall have a copy of the panel of jurors, two days before his trial; and that he shall have the same compulsive process with the Crown, to force his witnesses to appear<NOTE N="Q" PLACE="foot">Statute, 7 W.</NOTE>. A change of situation too frequently makes an alteration in the principles of men. Many who had suffered by the want of such a law, in the two former reigns, opposed with vehemence the bill. They argued, that the security of the government, was the best provi∣sion for the security of the subject; and they urged, that the act, by giving every possible advantage to conspirators, exposed the kingdom to revolution and change.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A supply voted.</NOTE> On the second of December, the commons voted the supply for the war. Two millions five hundred thousand pounds were assigned to the navy<NOTE N="R" PLACE="foot">Journals, Dec. 6.</NOTE>; two millions for the support of an army of eighty-seven thousand men. Though these sums were great, they were less than the demands of the Crown. There was, besides, an arrear of deficiency, for which no provision was made. But before the supply was fixed upon adequate funds, a matter of the last importance employed the attention of the commons. The act passed in the preceding session of parliament, to pre∣vent the clipping and exportation of silver coin, had been found inadequate to the purpose. The evil had risen to too great a height to be removed by slight remedies. The lords went first upon the business.
<PB N="94" REF="107"/>
They prepared an address, to which they desired the concurrence of the commons, to request the King to put a stop, by proclamation, to the currency of clip∣ped crowns and half-crowns. The commons chose to proceed in their own way. They went into a committee of the whole house, to deliberate on the state of the nation with respect to the current coin<NOTE N="S" PLACE="foot">Journals.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Debates</NOTE> Individuals differed much in their opinions, upon a subject in which the interests of all were so deeply concerned. It appeared, from various experiments, that the silver coins, on a medium, were diminished at least one third. In proportion as the intrinsic of silver sunk beneath its nominal value, the gold rose. Two evils, with equal violence, pressed the nation on either side. A remedy must be instantly applied. The first question proposed to the commons was, whether it was expedient to re-coin the silver money. The house was divided upon the subject. The opponents of the Court opposed the re-coinage, with some spe∣cious arguments. They affirmed, that the present conjuncture was by no means fit for a measure, whose operations must give so general and so violent a shock to the nation. They observed, that the people, labour∣ed under the calamity and expence of a burdensome and doubtful war. That the nation as yet unsettled in their opinions with regard to the present establishment, might be provoked by this new grievance to unhinge the government. That though things might be ma∣naged and accommodated at home, it would be diffi∣cult, if not impossible, to maintain either commerce or war abroad. That a present re-coinage would most certainly suspend all the operations of trade, for the want of mutual payments; and they concluded with affirming, that the people, in their despair, might be hurried into the most dreadful extremities.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">on the coin-act.</NOTE> The necessity of a speedy remedy was argued by the other side. They observed, that the bad state of the coin, had turned the exchange of all Europe, in an alarming degree, against the nation. That, there∣fore, the supplies voted for the support of the army
<PB N="95" REF="108"/>
abroad, would never answer their end. That gui∣neas, by this growing evil, were already advanced to thirty shillings; and foreign gold in the same extrava∣gant proportion. That all Europe sent their gold, as the most valuable of all commodities, into our market. That gold, at last, would remain the sole currency for trade in the kingdom. But that it could not be ex∣pected, that other nations would receive that commo∣dity at the value which it bore in this kingdom. They concluded with affirming, that the evil would gather additional strength every day. That the contagion had already spread through every vein of commerce; and that unless a speedy and powerful remedy should be applied, the certain dissolution of the state advanced with hasty strides.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A bill passed.</NOTE> The question whether the standard of the several denominations of the new money should continue the same, produced many and vehement debates. Some affirmed, that as the price of silver was raised<NOTE N="T" PLACE="foot">To six shillings and three-pence.</NOTE>, the standard should be proportionably increased. They argued, that the measure would prevent the exporta∣tion of the coin, and the melting of it down, as had been practised for several years. They urged, at the same time, that people would be induced to bring their plate and bullion to the mint, from views of ad∣vantage. The majority, with more reason, asserted, that it was impossible the price of silver could either rise or fall in respect of itself. That the alteration in the price of bullion, was merely relative to the dimi∣nished money; and they affirmed, in support of their position, that an ounce of bullion could be actually bought, at that very time, for five shillings and two pence of new-milled money. As to the exportation of the coin, they justly observed, that nothing could ef∣fectually prevent that evil, but a superiority in trade over other nations. The arguments for a new coin∣age, on the old standard, at length prevailed. The present inconvenience was deemed less dangerous, than the future evils which were justly to be apprehended. The commons resolved to put a stop to the currency, and to proceed to a new coinage with the utmost at∣tention
<PB N="96" REF="109"/>
and dispatch<NOTE N="S" PLACE="foot">Dec. 10.</NOTE>. A bill was accordingly brought in, for that purpose<NOTE N="T" PLACE="foot">Dec. 17.</NOTE>; and twelve hundred thousand pounds were voted, for supplying the difici∣ency of clipped money.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Address against the Scotish East-India company.</NOTE> These measures, though spirited, appeared, from the event, to be too precipitate. A proclamation for stopping the currency of the gold coin, was issued, before the mint had provided any quantity of new money for the purposes of trade. This evil was, in some measure, remedied by an act formed, upon sub∣sequent resolutions, in parliament. But the wisdom of that assembly could not prevent a general loss of cre∣dit, which shook the government, while it distressed the nation. Another affair of importance employed a part of the attention of both houses, during the de∣bates, on the coin. On the fourteenth of Decem∣ber<NOTE N="V" PLACE="foot">Dec. 14.</NOTE>, the lords sent down to the commons an ad∣dress to the King, against an act passed in the Scotish parliament, for erecting a company trading to Africa and the East-Indies. The commons concurred with the peers. The two houses attended the King with their address. His answer was, that he had been ill-served in Scotland. But that he hoped some remedy might be found to the evil of which they complained. This indefinite reply was not sufficient to satisfy the commons. <NOTE PLACE="marg">1696</NOTE> They resolved, that the directors of the Scotish company should be impeached of high crimes and misdemeanors.

He ordered his servants to oppose the bill, with all the influence of office. But the current of public opinion was turned toward new regulations, for the protection and encouragement of commerce. The waste occa∣sioned by the war, the loss by captures at sea, and the late disasters on that element, had raised general com∣plaints and produced many petitions. The enemies of William took advantage of the vehemence of the peo∣ple. Even some of his supposed friends and actual favourites promoted a measure, which he avowedly disapproved. The Earl of Sunderland, with all his adherents, declared for the bill. The King ascribed the conduct of this nobleman to his fears from the po∣pular party. But he was in a secret correspondence with James; and he had promised to oppose the measures of William in parliament<NOTE N="X" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1695.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The com∣mons ad∣dress against the Earl of Portland.</NOTE> While the commons seemed, thus, to encroach on the power of the crown, they pushed an inquiry, which affected the person of the King. Bentinck, whom William had created Earl of Portland, retained in England that ascendency in the favour of his mas∣ter, which he had acquired in Holland. He had ob∣tained, from the King, a grant of the lordships of Denbigh, Bromfield, and Yale, in the county of Denbigh, and a part of the ancient demesnes of the Prince of Wales. The gentleman of the county had opposed the warrant for the grant, in the treasury. They followed it, with their opposition, to the office of the Earl of Pembroke, who was then lord-privy-seal. This nobleman was, at the time, in correspon∣dence with the late King. He heard the petitioners with a seeming candour which bordered on favour. The affair was permitted to lie dormant. But the warrant was not re-called. The gentlemen of Den∣bigh carried their complaints before parliament. Mr. Price, afterwards a baron of the exchequer, intro∣duced the petition with a spirited, but vehement and bitter speech. The house, warmed to a degree of
<PB N="98" REF="111"/>
fury, voted unanimously an address against the grant. The King promised to recall the warrant. But he assured the commons, that he would find some other way of shewing his favour to the Earl of Portland<NOTE N="Y" PLACE="foot">Journals.</NOTE>. He performed his promise in the most ample manner, in the succeeding May.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An incident favourable to William.</NOTE> In the midst of circumstances so mortifying to Wil∣liam, a favourable event changed the whole face of his affairs. The reputation which he had acquired in Flanders, his weight and consequence abroad, and his own persevering policy at home, were not sufficient to supply the loss of influence which he sustained in the death of Mary. The nation, distressed by an adulterated and diminished currency, offended at the captures made upon their commerce at sea, and op∣pressed with the enormous expence of the war by land, placed all their misfortunes to the account of the King's predilection for other interests than those of England. His manner was better calculated to in∣flame than to allay the ferment which prevailed in the minds of his subjects. His enemies took every advan∣tage of the state of the public opinion. They in∣creased the discontents of the people in general; and they found means to improve the same bad humour in the new parliament.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Preparati∣ons of James, for an invasion.</NOTE> The malcontents had foreseen, in the preceding summer, the height to which the bad humour of the people was likely to rise. They urged the late King, as has been already related, to undertake an invasion. They promised insurrections in England, whenever he should appear on the coast. When the new parlia∣ment discovered symptoms of refractoriness to the measures of William, the adherents of James redou∣bled their instances for an invasion, early in the spring. They assured that Prince, that to land in England wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to regain, without contest, his crown.

He, however, insisted, that the Jacobites should rise in arms, before the French troops should embark; and the Duke of Berwick was dispatched, by his father, to England, to take the in∣surgents under his command<NOTE N="Z" PLACE="foot">James II. 1696.</NOTE>. The preparations of France were carried forward with expedition and zeal. The troops, intended for the invasion, began to draw near to Calais and Dunkirk. Four hundred sail of great and small vessels were assembled, from different ports. James himself, urged by Lewis the Fourteenth, took post on the seventeenth of Februa∣ry; and he arrived, on the twentieth, at Calais. The Dutch became alarmed, for their own country. But an unaccountable security prevailed in Britain<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A conspira∣cy against the King's life.</NOTE> During these preparations for an invasion from France, a conspiracy for assassinating William was framed in England, by some zealous adherents of the late King. This scheme had been forming long. One Crosby had been sent to the court of St. Germains to demand a commission from James, for perpetrating the crime. But that Prince suspected, from his ear∣nestness, that Crosby was employed by William him∣self, to persuade him to consent to a measure, which must for ever put an end to his hopes<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. The zea∣lous conspirators had long endeavoured, but in vain, to argue James into an express approbation of the at∣tempt upon the person of the King. They, however, obtained at length a commission, for a general insur∣rection<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>, against William and all his adherents. This commission was placed<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">Dec. 10, 1695.</NOTE> in the hands of Sir George Barclay, a native of Scotland, a man of cou∣rage and an experienced soldier. Barclay arrived in London, in the month of January. He joined him∣self, in that city, to one Harrison, a priest, to Char∣nock, who, from being a fellow of Magdalen college at Oxford, had become a Roman catholic, and a captain, to one Captain Porter, and to Sir William Perkins.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="113"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The plot discovered.</NOTE> These inconsiderate and daring men, under the pre∣tence of a commission from James, gained over some desperate Jacobites to aid them, in their projected scheme. They first proposed to surprise, seize, and carry William to France<NOTE N="E" PLACE="foot">James II. 1696.</NOTE>. But this was deemed impracticable, should they scruple to take his life<NOTE N="F" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> They resolved, therefore, to attack him, with an arm∣ed party consisting of forty men, in the midst of his guards. The scene of the intended assault was the lane between Brentford and Turnham-Green, through which William usually passed, upon his return from Richmond. The fifteenth of February was the day appointed for the execution of their purpose. But an unexpected discovery baffled, at once, their views. A Captain Fisher, whom the chief conspirators had re∣solved to employ in the attack, communicated the whole to the Earl of Portland, on the thirteenth of February. The same evening, Pendergrass, an Irish∣man, and one of the forty, confirmed the information of Fisher. They were both examined by the King in person. He encouraged them to mix again with their friends. He kept at home on the fifteenth of February. The conspirators fixed upon the twenty-second of the month, to execute their scheme. The King again remained at home. A panic seized the whole party. Some fled. But others were seized, the next night<NOTE N="G" PLACE="foot">Feb. 26, 1696</NOTE>, in their beds. </P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's speech to the parlia∣ment.</NOTE> The day after the seizure of some of the conspira∣tors, the King informed his parliament of the danger which had threatened his life. He acquainted the two houses, that preparations were made in France, for invading the kingdom. He assured himself, he said, that nothing should be omitted, on their part, that might be deemed proper for the present safety or the future security of his people. He told them, that he had not been wanting, in giving the necessary orders to the fleet. That he had commanded a con∣siderable body of troops to be brought home. That some of the conspirators against his person were al∣ready seized. That care was taken to apprehend the
<PB N="101" REF="114"/>
rest; and that, upon the whole, all such other orders were given, as the public safety, in the present con∣juncture, seemed to require. The two houses lost, at once, their bad humour, in the danger to which the life of the King had been exposed. They sent a joint address to the throne, full of expressions of the most unlimited zeal and loyalty. They declared to all the world, that should his Majesty come to any violent death, they would revenge the same on all his enemies and their adherents. As an instance of their affection to William, they promised to give all possible dispatch to the public business; and they made it their desire to the King to seize, upon the present occasion, all such persons as he should think fit to apprehend<NOTE N="H" PLACE="foot">Journals, Feb. 24.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Zeal of the two houses.</NOTE> The commons followed their warm address with various resolutions of the same kind. They ordered in a bill to enable his Majesty to seize all suspected per∣sons. They prepared an address, for commanding, by proclamation, all papists to retire from the cities of London and Westminster. They drew up the form of an association, for the defence of the King's person. They acknowledged him the rightful and lawful So∣vereign of England. They engaged themselves to support and defend the succession of the crown, ac∣cording to the act of settlement, passed in the first year of the present reign. Four hundred members placed their names to the association, in one day. Such as withdrew from the house or were absent with leave, were ordered to sign that paper or signify their refusal, before the sixteenth of March<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. The same warmth of affection and even vehemence of zeal ex∣tended themselves to the Lords. The peers adopted, with little alteration, the association signed by the commons. The whole nation partook of the flame, which the discovery of the plot had kindled in the two houses of parliament. Their objections to William were obliterated, at once, by their abhorrence of the conspiracy against his life; and thus the imprudence of his enemies confirmed him in a throne, on which he tottered before.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="115"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Projects of the late King brok∣en.</NOTE> This unsuccessful under-plot of a few zealots was sufficient to ruin all the present projects of the late King. But the seeds of disappointment were already sown in France itself. A Mr. Powel had been sent to St. Germains, from the Jacobites in England, to lay before James the state of the designs in his favour in that kingdom. Powel spoke with such vehemence, confidence, and zeal, that the late King supposed, that his party were resolved to take arms, when they should receive certain intelligence of his own prepara∣tions for an invasion from France. He desired Powel to put the whole in writing. But, before his com∣mands were executed, James happened to meet and converse with the most Christian King. He told that Prince, that his friends in England were ready, upon the first notice, to take arms. He perceived his mistake, when he read Mr. Powel's written account. But he was afraid of alarming the French ministers, who were never his friends, by undeceiving the King. The preparations, for the expedition, proceeded upon this mistake. The adherents of James had declared it im∣possible for them to rise, till he himself should land. Lewis gave positive orders, that not a single vessel should sail, till certain intelligence of an insurrection should arrive from England. The late King was per∣plexed beyond measure by this insurmountable difficul∣ty. He derived his whole hopes from fortune; and as usual, he was deceived<NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">James H. 1696.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The invasi∣on laid aside.</NOTE> The discovery of the plot in England, broke, in an instant, the whole scheme. The kingdom was in a ferment.

against the enemy, among the sands of Dunkirk. The appearance of the English fleet put an end to a design, which seemed to be already broken. Admiral Russel, upon the first certain intelligence of the invasion, was ordered to repair to the Downs. Having hoisted his flag, on board the Victory, and collected, with incre∣dible diligence and expedition, a powerful fleet, he stood over to Graveline, and stretched along the coast to Calais. Calais was again bombarded, with little effect. To destroy the French men of war was found impracticable. But the enemy, instead of preparing for a descent on England, became anxious for their own coast. James, in a disconsolate state of mind, re∣turned, at length, to St. Germains. He saw his pro∣ject broken, his hopes blasted, his friends ruined, by their pursuing measures contrary to his judgment and without his consent<NOTE N="L" PLACE="foot">James H. 1696.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Conspirators punished.</NOTE> The courts of justice were, in the mean time, em∣ployed in the trial of such of the conspirators as had fallen into the hands of government. Charnock, King, and Keys, were the first tried; and, upon positive evidence, condemned and executed. They declared, with one consent, in papers delivered to the sheriffs, that James was not only not privy to the design, against the person of William, but that he always rejected such proposals when offered. Sir John Friend, a wealthy citizen, and Sir William Perkins were, soon after, tried and condemned. The first for abetting the intended invasion. The latter for concurring in the plot against the life of the King. Several other per∣sons of less consequence and rank inferior, suffered death, for the same crimes. The evidence against the most of the prisoners was full and decisive. The no∣toriety of the conspiracy proved more fatal to a few, than the facts advanced by the witnesses. The con∣spiracy against the King was confounded, on the pre∣sent occasion, with the intended invasion from France. The whole seemed to have been the exact counter∣part of the conspiracy in the year 1683; when the people, in their horror of the Rye-house-plot, trans∣ferred

the guilt of assassins to men who meditated only an insurrection. The criminals, on the present occa∣sion, died enthusiasts to their political principles. They confirmed their own minds in an opinion, which they endeavoured in vain to inculcate on James, that any attack, on an enemy, was a species of war<NOTE N="M" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1696.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceedings of parlia∣ment.</NOTE> During these transactions, the parliament proceeded in the same strain of complaisance to the crown, which the attempt on the life of the King had raised. Sup∣plies were granted not only with liberality, but even without reserve. Clauses of loan were inserted, in almost every money-bill. An act was passed, im∣powering the King to apprehend and detain such per∣sons, as he might suspect of conspiring against his per∣son and government. The commons, in a body, pre∣sented the association, at the foot of the throne, on the third of April. The lords, soon after, followed the example laid by the lower house. A bank for the purpose of raising money for the use of the govern∣ment, was established by act of parliament. This new institution obtained the name of the national land∣bank, from its security lying on land. The measure was unadvised, and proved mischievous to public cre∣dit. Notwithstanding the complaisance of the two houses, the King exerted his prerogative, in a man∣ner that gave some offerce to the commons. He re∣fused his assent to a bill for regulating elections of members to serve in parliament. The projectors of the bill made a motion, that those, who had advised his Majesty to put a negative on the bill, were enemies to the King and kingdom. But the current of the times ran, with violence, in favour of government; and the motion was rejected, by a great majority<NOTE N="N" PLACE="foot">Journals.</NOTE>.

</ARGUMENT>
<P><MILESTONE N="1696" UNIT="year"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Exhausted state of France.</NOTE> THE glory assumed by France, for having sus∣tained herself so long against the rest of Europe in confederacy, was more than balanced by her do∣mestic distress. Her great exertions had impoverished her subjects, by enormous taxes and imposts. An ear∣nest desire for peace prevailed throughout the kingdom. Past disappointments, and the fear of future misfor∣tunes, had abated the ambition of the King. He had lost his best generals in the course of the war; and a great part of the reputation of his arms, in the pre∣ceding campaign. A deficiency in resources deprived him of every hope of making any successful efforts in the present year. He had even some reason to fear, he could not retain what he had already gained; and
<PB N="106" REF="119"/>
that, instead of pushing the enemy in their territories, he would find it difficult to defend his own.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Her in∣trigues,</NOTE> France, however, endeavoured to supply with ad∣dress what she wanted in point of power. To provide against the misfortunes dreaded from the continuance of a burdensome war, Lewis extended, with success, his intrigues to the different courts of Europe. It Turkey, he induced Mustapha the second to frustrate all the attempts made by the maritime powers to facili∣tate a peace. He secured his influence in Poland, by a pension to the Queen. He gained the confidence of the courts of Italy, by professing a concern for the re∣pose and prosperity of a country harassed by the exacti∣ons of the allied powers. He disconcerted the mea∣sures of the Germanic body, by fomenting the feuds, and supporting the pretensions of the various princes He placed spies, and established pensioners in Spain. He gained the good offices of the King of Sweden, by flattering his pride; and, in Holland, he renewed his ancient correspondence with the heads of the Repub∣lican party.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and desire of peace.</NOTE> In the midst of measures for supporting the war with vigour, the French King thought seriously of means to obtain peace. He endeavoured, in the preceding year, through the channel of Denmark and Sweden to negociate a treaty for the re-establishment of the tranquillity of Europe. He had, in some measure agreed to a preliminary of the Imperial court, that the affair of England should be settled to the satisfaction of the Prince of Orange. He even ascribed the con∣tinuance of the war, to William's hopes of regaining in one campaign, the laurels which he had lost in the war. During the winter, the court of France conti¦nued to make advances toward a peace. To facilitat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a treaty, they proposed to the States of Holland, that<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in case the affair of England was not settled to the sa¦tisfaction of the Prince of Orange, the whole negoci¦ation should be void. They agreed to admit the trea¦ties of Westphalia and Nimeguen as the basis of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> expected peace. But these advances, on the side o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> France, were not answered with equal warmth by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> allied powers. In proportion to the eagerness of Lew<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>

for peace, they rose in their demands; and thus, throughout the summer, the whole affair remained in suspence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An inactive campaign in Flanders.</NOTE> William, having left London on the second of May, arrived at the Hague on the seventh of that month. But he joined not his troops till the sixth of June. The French had taken the field, with two armies. One, under Mareschal de Villeroi, was posted be∣tween Mechlen and Deynse. The Mareschal de Boufflers commanded another, between Flerus and Sombref. The King opposed, in person, the enemy at Mariekirke, with one army. The Elector of Ba∣varia assembled another in the neighbourhood of Lou∣vain. The whole summer either passed in inaction, or was wasted in motions, which neither promised nor produced any important event. Though no congress was opened, the expectations of peace suspended the operations of war. The allies were in no condition to push, with vigour, the advantages which they had ob∣tained in the preceding campaign; and France, in her present condition, considered her being able to protect her conquests, an advantage equal to the glory of a victory.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Operations on the side of Spain.</NOTE> To avail himself of the weakness of Spain, the French King bent his principal efforts towards that side. A dispute with the Court of Madrid, on ac∣count of a Jew, who had served him in quality of an agent, had contributed to induce William to withdraw all the naval force of the English from the Mediterra∣nean. But the French, having ordered the squadron at Toulon to fail into the ocean, were incapable of insulting the coast of Spain, though exposed. They, however, pushed with some vigour their operations by land. The Duke de Vendôme, who commanded in Catalonia, was ordered to take the field. He passed the Ter, on the the thirtieth of May. He attacked the Prince of Hesse Darmstadt, on the banks of that river, and forced him to retire with loss under the cannon of Ostalric. An inactive campaign succeeded this undecisive engagement. The hopes of an imme∣diate peace, and the prospect of future advantages, rose to France on the side of Spain. The Queen-mother,
<PB N="108" REF="121"/>
who, as a daughter of Austria, had carried the ammosities of her family against France, into the councils of Charles the second, was lately dead. Lewis the Fourteenth had his agents at Madrid; and he, even then, entertained hopes of practising to ad∣vantage on the weakness of that Prince<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Hist. d'Espagne.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Naval trans∣actions.</NOTE> Nothing of any moment happened on the side of Germany. The French and Imperialists alternately passed and repassed, to little purpose, the Rhine. The efforts of the maritime powers at sea, were as languid and undecisive as their operations by land. Sir George Rooke, upon his return from Cadiz, where he had wintered with his squadron, was appointed commander in chief of the combined fleet. Having, in vain, endeavoured to intercept the French fleet, upon its way from Toulon to Brest, he returned to Torbay, on the twenty-third of May, and he was re-called by the lords of the regency from his command. The lord Berkley, who succeeded Rooke, performed nothing of any importance. The most remarkable transaction of this summer at sea, was performed by Du Bart; who had sailed with a French squadron from Dunkirk, in the end of May. He fell in, on the eighth of June, with a fleet of Dutch merchant∣men, from the Baltic, under the convoy of five men of war. The latter he took, after an obstinate resist∣ance. Thirty of the former fell also into his hands. Having performed this important service, he escaped the vigilance of an English squadron, and returned with his booty to France<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">Hist. de France, tom. iii.</NOTE>.</P>

Desertion of the Duke of Savoy..</NOTE> On the side of Hungary, an undecisive battle be∣tween the Ottomans and the Imperialists, near Te∣meswaer, comprehended the whole operations of the campaign.

The Czar of Muscovy, by the tak∣ing of Asoph, on the Tanais, rendered himself, for the first time, an object of attention to the courts of

Europe. A peace, between the French and the Duke of Savoy, changed the whole face of affairs in Italy. This pacification, which greatly disconcerted the allies, had been long negociated by the Count de Tessè, as intermediate agent between the Duke and the Mare∣schal de Catinat, who commanded the French troops on the side of Savoy. De Catinat made the first offer of peace, on the sixth of June. The Duke, willing to secure the supplies of the year from England and Holland, concealed, for some time, the treaty, after it was actually signed<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">May 30th.</NOTE>. When he professed to avow the conditions, they only seemed to comprehend the neutrality of Italy. He suppressed the terms, which concerned his own interest. But to convince the confederates of his determination to adhere to his agreement with France, he laid siege, on the thir∣teenth of September, to Valentia, in conjunction with the Mareschal de Catinat<NOTE N="E" PLACE="foot">Hist. de France, tom. iii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Advances toward a peace.</NOTE> The defection of the Duke of Savoy, while it much offended all the confederates, rendered the maritime powers, in particular, very desirous of peace. William had various reasons to wish for an immediate pacification with France. The failure of the land∣bank, on which he had so much credit, the consequent difficulty of present remittances, the uncertainty of future supplies, the example of Savoy, for further desertions from the common cause, the disposition of the States against the continuance of a burdensome war, the clamours of the English, under their heavy taxes, all combined to make the re-establishment of the tranquility of Europe an object of importance to the King. He, therefore, prosecuted with sincerity every measure to accomplish his views. He concurred with the States, in appointing Dykveldt to confer with Callieres, who had, for some time, carried on in Holland secret negociations leading to a peace. On the twenty-fourth of August, Dykveldt communicated the whole proceedings to the deputies of the States for foreign affairs. The deputies made their report, on the third of September, to the States-General; who
<PB N="110" REF="123"/>
came to a resolution, that the concessions of France to the demands of the Emperor, were sufficient grounds for accepting the mediation of Sweden in concluding a general treaty of peace. The house of Austria, in neither of its branches, seemed willing to close with the proposal of the maritime powers. The court of Spain was offended with William. The Emperor had an interest in continuing the war<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">De Torcy, tom. i.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">English, Scotish, and Irish affairs.</NOTE> In England, nothing of importance happened dur∣ing the summer. The lords of the regency applied their chief attention to the re-coinage of the silver money; and to the operations of the fleet at sea. In Scotland, a session of parliament was held, on the eighth of September. The Lord Murray, eldest son of the Marquis of Athol, being created Earl of Tul∣libardin, was appointed commissioner. The Earl of Arran, and other malcontents, took the oaths, for the first time, and their seats in the house. A supply was voted, for one year's service, to maintain the stand∣ing forces: a measure calculated to induce the govern∣ment to hold an annual session for its own support. An ill-humour had crept into parliament. The people were distressed with a general scarcity, which render∣ed them clamorous and discontented. The commissi∣oner, therefore, thought proper to put an end to the session, on the ninth of October. The Lord Capel dying in Ireland, the government of that kingdom de∣volved, by the choice of the council, on the chancel∣lor, Sir Charles Porter; in terms of an old act of par∣liament<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">33 Hen.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Parliament meets.</NOTE> On the seventh of October, the King arrived from Holland, at Kensington. On the twentieth of the same month, the parliament met at Westminster. William, in his speech from the throne, expressed his satisfaction, that no disorder had happened at home,
<PB N="111" REF="124"/>
and no disadvantage abroad, in the course of the pre∣sent year. He ascribed this happiness to the good dis∣position of his army and the steady affection of his people for his person. He recommended unanimity, on account of the magnitude and importance of the business which they had to transact: the supplying of former deficiencies, the providing for the service of the ensuing year. He informed them of overtures made for a general peace. But that the only means to re-establish the public tranquillity, was to show themselves prepared for a vigorous and effectual war.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Diligence of the com∣mons.</NOTE> The commons, with perfect unanimity, agreed im∣mediately to resolutions which answered the chief de∣mands of the King's speech. In a spirited address, they promised, in the name of the people of England, to support his Majesty, in obtaining, by war, a safe and honourable peace<NOTE N="E" PLACE="foot">Oct. 22.</NOTE>.

They applied themselves with the utmost diligence to this necessary business. The sums to be raised were immense. The deficiency of former funds amounted to more than six millions. Two millions and a half were found necessary for the navy; and a still greater sum for the service by land. Public credit had, in the mean time, sunk so low, that bank-notes were at twenty per cent. discount, and exchequer tallies at sixty per cent. The commons turned their imme∣diate
<PB N="112" REF="125"/>
attention to the silver coin. They resolved, that the hammered money should be received only by weight. That an allowance of four pence an ounce should be made on all loans and plate brought to the mint, before the first of January<NOTE N="G" PLACE="foot">Nov. 3.</NOTE>. To answer the most pressing demands on government, they re∣solved to transfer to the next aids, any loans, not ex∣ceeding six hundred thousand pounds, that should be advanced on the credit of the exchequer<NOTE N="H" PLACE="foot">Nov. 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Public cre∣dit restored.</NOTE> To restore the credit of the bank, which had, from various causes, fallen so low, the commons resolved to extend the time of its continuance, and to aug∣ment the capital<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot">Feb. 3. 1697.</NOTE>. The new subscriptions were wisely ordered to be made, in the tallies, upon parlia∣mentary funds, and in bank-notes. The first, in the proportion of four-fifths of the payments. The lat∣ter, as having been subject to the least discount, in that of one-fifth. Men of money, for the benefit of acquiring, at a low price, a capital in the bank, pur∣chased, with such eagerness, the tallies and notes, that their price arose. The latter soon became equal to money. The discounts on the former fell rapidly, as a fund for the payment was fixed. To supply the scarcity of money, was as necessary for the purposes of commerce and government, as the recovery of the credit of the bank notes and tallies. Bills were order∣ed to be issued from the exchequer, to the amount of two millions, bearing interest at more than seven <HI>per cent.</HI> These were received in the exchequer, with a small discount, in the payments made of the reve∣nue. This measure raised, at length, exchequer bills to an equality with money, and supplied, at present, the want of coin.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir John Fenwick's case.</NOTE> The extraordinary case of Sir John Fenwick inter∣rupted, in some degree, the deliberations of the com∣mons, on the subject of public credit. Fenwick had been accused of being concerned in a plot against the
<PB N="113" REF="126"/>
King. He was taken, at New Romney, in the pre∣ceding June, in endeavouring to make his escape to France. He was committed to Newgate, and a bill found against him by the grand jury<NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">June 11, 1696.</NOTE>. To pre∣serve, or, at least, to prolong his life, he fell upon the expedient of obtaining a pardon, as a price of dis∣coveries to the King. Through the means of the Duke of Devonshire, he conveyed a paper to William, when he was in Flanders, containing an account of correspondences and intrigues, carried on with the court of St. Germains, by the Duke of Shrewsbury, the Earls of Bath and Marlborough, the Lord Godol∣phin, and Admiral Russel. Though this account is known, now, to be true, in every particular, it nei∣ther gained William's favour nor served the design of Fenwick. The persons accused were too powerful to be punished. Besides, Fenwick had refused to be an evidence; and had he done otherwise, the proofs, which he could produce, were not sufficient in law. His trial, however, was delayed, by various means, till the King's arrival in England. His friends in the mean time, removed one of the two witnesses, on whose oaths the bill had been found; and, according to the statutes of treason, a single witness was not suf∣ficient to condemn.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He is at∣tained and executed.</NOTE> William is said to have entertained a personal enmi∣mity<NOTE N="L" PLACE="foot">James II. 1694.</NOTE> against Fenwick, for some expressions, re∣flecting on his conduct, when he served in the army in Holland. This disposition, in the King's mind, com∣bined with the resentment of the accused persons, con∣tributed to punish, in a very irregular manner, that unfortunate man. Admiral Russel, by the express permission of William, was the first, who laid before the commons the information of Fenwick, which re∣flected on himself and several other persons of high rank. The prisoner was brought to the bar of the house, and required to confess all he knew<NOTE N="M" PLACE="foot">Jour∣nals, Nov. 6.</NOTE>.

That this lord uniformly betrayed the late King to the views of the present, when Prince of Orange, is now known, and was, even then, suspected, by the intel∣ligent. There seemed, therefore, to have been a degree of imprudence, in the appointment, though the place, which he held before in William's favour, entitled him to a part of the management of public affairs. On the twenty-second of April, the earl was sworn a privy-councillor, and, as such, took his place at the board. He was comprehended in the com∣mission of lords-justices; and, though at the time in correspondence with James<NOTE N="T" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1696.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Congress at Riswick.</NOTE> On the twenty-fourth of April, the King left Ken∣sington, and arrived, on the twenty-seventh, at the Hague. The advances made toward a peace, in the end of the preceding summer, were improved in the winter. William had named, in the month of De∣cember, three plenipotentiaries to negociate a treaty. The French King had appointed two persons, in the like capacity, to be joined to Calliers, who had long carried on a negociation at the Hague. The Em∣peror and the court of Spain threw various objections in the way. But these being, at length, over-ruled, by the rest of the allies, a congress was agreed to be opened, under the mediation of Charles the Eleventh, King of Sweden. That Prince dying, in the mean time, the office of mediator was transferred to his son. The ambassadors of the belligerent powers met,

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The peace opposed by the Empe∣ror and Spain.</NOTE> France and the maritime powers seemed to find little difficulty, in defining their respective claims. Eng∣land and Holland had scarce any farther concern in the treaty, than to settle a barrier in Flanders, and to procure an ample acknowledgment of William's right to the throne. Calliers, then sole plenipotentiary for Lewis the Fourteenth in Holland, had consented, as early as the tenth of February, to preliminaries, which declared, that Strasbourg should be restored to the Emperor, Mons, Charleroi, Dinant, and the whole duchy of Luxembourg, together with the con∣quests in Catalonia to the Spaniards, the duchy of Lorrain to its native Prince; and that the title of William should be acknowledged, without any man∣ner of difficulty, restriction, condition or reserve.

Don John of Austria, though he stript her of her power, followed her system. The ministers, who succeeded Don John, pursued the same principle. They kept their sovereign a kind of prisoner, in his own palace; and governed, in his name, a kingdom long exhausted by a succession of wretched councils. The treaty of Nimeguen having established a good understanding between the courts of Madrid and Ver∣sailles, the King married Maria-Louisa, daughter of the Duke of Orleans. This princess, unambitious of governing a weak husband, left him, at first, in the hands of his ministers; and her interference, at length, in favour of France, proved fatal to herself. In the beginning of the year 1689, England and Holland, in alliance with the Emperor, resolved to draw Spain in∣to the war against Lewis the Fourteenth. The Queen died suddenly. Mansfeldt, the Imperial ambassador, and the Count of Oropeza, were at no pains to con∣ceal, that they had removed, by a wicked piece of policy, a person, who was likely to obstruct their views<NOTE N="U" PLACE="foot">Torcy's Memoirs, vol. i.</NOTE>.</P>

Being sister to the Empress, she was firmly attached to the allies, and she governed Spain.

Her object was to induce her husband to send for her nephew, the arch-duke, to Madrid, to be educated, as the sole heir of Spain. The King, for some time, resisted her importunities. But, in the year 1696, he yielded to his own fears. Alarmed at the progress of the French, in the heart of his king∣dom, he promised to invite the arch-duke to Spain, upon condition that the Emperor should send twelve thousand of his troops to oppose the enemy in Catalo∣nia.

As William trusted not his three plenipotentiaries at the Hague, with his agreement with France, man∣kind justly concluded, that a secret of the last im∣portance had been for some time depending between the two kings. Time has, at length, unraveled the mystery. Lewis, unwilling to desert James, proposed that the Prince of Wales should succeed to the crown

of England, after the death of William. The King, with little hesitation, agreed to this request. He e∣ven solemnly engaged, to procure the repeal of the act of settlement; and to declare, by another, the Prince of Wales his successor in the throne<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot">James II. 1697.</NOTE>. This great preliminary being settled, other matters of less importance followed of course. The fifty thousand pounds a year, settled as a jointure upon King James's Queen, was agreed to be paid; though the money was afterwards retained upon various pretences. On the third of August, the King left the army and retired to Dieren. He sent from thence the Earl of Portland, to acquaint the ministers assembled at the congress, that he had settled his own affairs, and those of his kingdoms, with France; and that he earnestly pressed the allies, and particularly the Emperor, to hasten the conclusion of the great work of peace.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections on that transaction.</NOTE> Those who ascribe all the actions of William to public spirit, will find some difficulty in reconciling this transaction to their elevated opinion of his cha∣racter. In one concession to France, he yielded all his professions to England; and, by an act of indiscre∣tion, or through indifference, deserted the principles to which he owed the throne. The deliverance of the nation was not, however, the sole object of this Prince. Like other men, he was subject to human passions; and, like them, when he could gratify him∣self, he served the world. Various motives seem to have concurred, to induce him to adopt a measure, unaccountable on other grounds. The projected peace was to secure the crown in his possession for his life. He had no children, and but few relations; and those he never loved. The successors provided by the act of settlement, he either despised or abhorred; and he seems hitherto not to have extended his views beyond the limits of that act. Though James had displeased the nation, he had not injured William. The son had offended neither. He might excite com∣passion, but he could be no object of aversion. The supposed spuriousness of his birth, had been only held
<PB N="124" REF="137"/>
forth to amuse the vulgar; and even these would be convinced, by the public acknowledgment intended to be made by the very person whose interest was most concerned in the support of that idle tale.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The propo∣sal rejected by James.</NOTE> But the same imprudence which lost to the late King the crown, excluded, for ever, his posterity from the throne. He told his most Christian Majesty, who had made the first overture to him, on this important sub∣ject, that though he could suffer with patience the usurpation of his nephew upon his right, he would ne∣ver permit his own son to be guilty of the same injus∣tice<NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">James II. 1697.</NOTE>. He urged, that should the son reign in his father's life-time, that circumstance would amount to a formal renunciation. That the Prince of Wales, by succeeding to the Prince of Orange, would yield his sole right, which was that of his father; and being obliged to the people for his elevation, the hands which had raised him, might, at any time, justly pull him down from his throne. That should he himself be capable of consenting to such a disgraceful proposal, in favour of his son, he might be justly reproached with departing from his avowed principles, and with ruin∣ing monarchy, by rendering elective an hereditary crown. Besides, that though he should consent to sa∣crifice all that he reckoned dear, to a mortal enemy, the Prince of Orange could only promise a thing, which he was not, perhaps, able to perform. That the same parliament that had conferred the royal au∣thority on himself, had settled the reversion of the crown on the Princess of Denmark; and that, there∣fore, by reversing the act of settlement, he disjointed the whole chain which bound the people to his go∣vernment. But that should even the Prince of Orange induce the parliament of England to repeal the act of settlement, it would be always upon condition of hav∣ing the Prince of Wales placed in their hands, without their being able to give any security either for his per∣son or his conscience<NOTE N="L" PLACE="foot">Memorial to the Pope, 1697.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">France more per∣emptory in her de∣mands.</NOTE> The last consideration was not, perhaps, the least motive of this deluded Prince, for rejecting the only certain prospect that had ever offered itself for restoring his family to the throne. The French King, perceiv∣ing his obstinacy, urged not further a point, of which James himself could be the only judge. The latter endeavoured, in the mean time, to stop the progress of a treaty, with vain protests, and with unavailing memorials and remonstrances to the confederate Princes. The demand of France, for the eventual succession of the Prince of Wales, being removed, the re-establishment of peace, between Lewis and William, became absolutely certain. The first, therefore, be∣came more peremptory in his negociations with the Empire and Spain, as the allies were already apparent∣ly disunited, he ordered his ministers, at the congress, to deliver in the project of a general peace, upon the footing of the preliminaries<NOTE N="M" PLACE="foot">July 20.</NOTE>. The project was accompanied with a declaration, limiting the time of its being accepted, to the last day in August. The house of Austria were as dilatory in their motions to∣ward a peace, as they had been slow in prosecuting the war. They paid no regard to the limitations offer∣ed by France, though they were in no condition for maintaining themselves singly against her power. Spain had added to her misfortunes at home, a distaster of an alarming king abroad. A French squadron, under De Pontis, had, with the assistance of the buccaniers, taken Carthagena in America, plundered the place of an immense treasure, and having escaped the utmost efforts and vigilance of the English sleet, arrived safe∣ly at Brest, on the nineteenth of August.</P>

That, therefore, he earnestly pressed the allies, and particularly the Emperor, to contribute all that lay in their power toward concluding so great a work. This declaration of the King, was regarded as a command. The plenipotentiaries of the States signed the treaty, on the ninth of September, about mid-night. Their example was taken in an hour af∣ter by the ambassador of Spain; and he was followed by the plenipotentiaries of England. The treaties of Munster and Nimeguen served as a basis for that with Holland. The places taken in Catalonia, the duchy of Luxembourg, the county of Chinei, Charleroi, Mons, Aeth, Courtrai, and all places united to France by the chambers of Metz and Brisac, were restored to Spain.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The bloods battle of Zenta.</NOTE> The Emperor had scarce agreed to the treaty of Riswick, when he received intelligence of the total defeat of the Turks at Zenta<NOTE N="P" PLACE="foot">Sept. 11.</NOTE>, a small village on the western bank of Theysse, in the kingdom of Hun∣gary. The famous Prince Eugene of Savoy, had suc∣ceeded the Elector of Saxony in the command of the army; and to his spirit and conduct was owing the compleat victory which the Imperialists had obtained. The slaughter, ratehr than the fight, lasted from ten in the morning, till late at night. The two preceding ages, though remarkable for battles, had not produced so bloody a combat. The Ottomans, broken by the enemy in front, were at the same time attacked in the rear. In less than an hour, resistance was over, on the side of the Turks, but the rest of the day was spent in butchery and blood. All endeavoured to gain the bridge, but it was rendered impassible, by the heaps of slain. To avoid the fury of the sword, thousands threw themselves into the river and were drowned. Thirty thousand were said to lie dead on the field, before coming of night saved a few fugitives from death. The camp of the enemy, the magnificent pa∣villion of the Sultan himself, the stores, the provisions, the ammunition, all the cannon and baggage, fell into the hands of the Prince Eugene. The grand Vizier was killed, the seal of the empire taken; the Aga of the Janizaries, and twenty-seven Bashaws were found among the slain. Never was victory more complete.

But that assembly wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> further prorogued to the third of December.

His servants felt the pulse of the nation, by publications on that subject. But instead of persuad∣ing the people into the views of the Crown, they a∣larmed their fears.

Some, who loved their country, were a∣fraid of a standing army. The adherents of James, were resolved to distress William on popular grounds. The few who harboured in secret republican opinions, opposed, from principle, a measure calculated to place an uncontroulable power in the hands of the King. The different views of all the parties centered in one point. They were supported by the people, in their opposition to the Crown. The nation was exhausted with late taxes. They were alarmed at the continu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce of present burdens, and terrified at future im∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>osts.

On the tenth of December, they received the King's answer to their address. Though he perceived the design of the commons, he receded not from his own purpose.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arguments for the question.</NOTE> The court-party urged various arguments for car∣rying a point, in which the King had signified himsel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to be much concerned. They urged, that as France had not yet disbanded any of her troops, it would be dangerous, as well as absurd, to trust to the faith of a treaty for the safety of the nation. They affirmed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that to trust the navy with the protection of the king¦dom, was to leave the fate of its independence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> fortune. They averred, from the example of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> late revolution, that a wind might arise, which coul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> carry an enemy out of their ports, and, at the sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> time, confine the ships of England to their own ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦bours.

But they denied it to be true, that pub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>

freedom was always ruined by armies. They pro∣duced Venice and the States of the United Provinces, as examples of this position; and they endeavoured to prove, that the liberties of France fell, through the dark policy of Lewis the Eleventh, and not by the means of a military force. They attempted to raise the fears of the people, by explaining the facility with which the late King might return. They represented the disaffection of a part of the nation, as too strong to be suppressed without the terrors of a standing ar∣my. They concluded with observing, that as the power of the purse was in the hands of the nation, the Crown might, without danger, be trusted with any degree of the power of the sword.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">General ar∣guments.</NOTE> On the other side, it was urged with vehemence, that an island like Britain had little to fear, from an enemy whose naval force was inferior to its own. They affirmed, that the fitting out of a fleet was a work of time. That the preparations of the kingdom might, in a great measure, keep pace with those of the invaders. That the confederates would either call the attention of France to another quarter, or she might be opposed with effect, on the coast of Eng∣land, by troops called from Scotland and Ireland. They affirmed, that no wind could arise more fa∣vourable to the French, in quitting their principal ports, than to the English in sailing from their own. Besides, that, merely for the bare possibility of such a circumstance, no Prince could be supposed to hazard a vast expence, upon one improbable contingency. That the examples of Venice, Holland, and France, were inapplicable to the present argument. That the two republics kept their standing forces only in their conquered countries. That though Lewis the Eleventh invaded the liberties of his subjects, without public violence, a standing army was soon found necessary to support the usurpations of the crown, on the natu∣ral rights of the people. They urged, with great force of argument, that a militia was the most natural and least dangerous protectors of the kingdom; as the gentry, freeholders, and traders of England, were more
<PB N="132" REF="147"/>
concerned in the freedom and safety of their country, than soldiers, whose only motive to action was pay.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Particular reasons against it.</NOTE> They descended from general to particular argu∣ments. They averred, that the most likely way to restore the late King, was to support a standing force to defeat his designs. To prove this position, they af∣firmed, that the affection of the people was the only rock on which the throne of the Prince could remain firm. That when it leans on a standing force, it de∣pends on the unsteady humours of the soldiery. Re∣volution and change, they shewed, from the examples of former ages, had proceeded oftener from the caprice of an army, than from the violence and inconstancy of the multitude. They alleged, that the fate of the kingdom would depend on the political principles, or the avarice of the chief officers. That one might be swayed by an affection for the late King, another gained with French money. They descended to all the inconveniencies, arising from standing armies. They mentioned quarrels, assassinations, robberies, the dishonouring of women, the insolence to men, their injustice to mankind in general, the licence derived from the pride of their station, their contempt for laws, by which they ceased to be confined. They, however, concluded, that it was, by no means, their design, to ruin, by the peace, those who had deserved so well of the nation, by their courage, fidelity, and conduct in the war. That their arguments were di∣rected against the thing itself, and not against particu∣lar men; and that, therefore, the officers ought to re∣ceive, from the parliament, a recompence for the loss of their commissions<NOTE N="Y" PLACE="foot">Journals.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The oppo∣sing mem∣bers pre∣vail.</NOTE> The adherents of the crown propagated rumours of danger, without doors, to strengthen their arguments within.

But these artifices produced no effect on the country party<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Some of the latter, in the course of their arguments<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

upbraided the King himself with a breach of faith to the nation. They observed, that, in his declaration when Prince of Orange, he promised, upon the settle∣ment of the nation, to send back all his foreign forces. But that, instead of adhering to his solemn engage∣ments, he still retained a great number of aliens about his person. That of his countrymen, the Dutch, he had a troop of horse, of two hundred and twenty men; and one regiment of body-guards of the same nation, consisting of four battalions, amounting to more than two thousand six hundred soldiers. That he had also, in the same capacity, one regiment of Scots, consisting of one thousand six hundred men; and that of French refugees, who depended on himself alone, he had two regiments of dragoons and three of foot, falling in all little short of five thousand men. The disaffected exaggerated greatly the dangers to be apprehended from these troops. They compared them to the pre∣torian bands, who executed the tyrannical decrees of the worst Emperors of Rome; and even to the Turk∣ish Janizaries, who, by being cut off, in their infancy, from all connexions with the rest of mankind, know no umpire but the sword, and own no ties but an ab∣solute submission to the will of the reigning Prince<NOTE N="Z" PLACE="foot">Trenchard's Remarks.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King disgusted.</NOTE> The warmth expressed in these debates, excited disgust on both sides. The King was highly displeas∣ed, with the conduct of the commons. A majority of the commons were almost dissatisfied with the choice they had made of a King. William was at no pains to conceal his sentiments. He complained, that by reducting his army, the commons had render∣ed him contemptible in the eyes of Europe. That he was doubtful, whether he could support either his go∣vernment at home or any of his alliances abroad, in his present despicable state. That had he foreseen such returns for his services, he would never have meddled with English affairs; and that he was weary of governing a nation, who, through their jealousy of the crown, exposed their sovereign to contempt and themselves to danger<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii.</NOTE>. But when the King vent∣ed

his resentment in complaints, his chief adviser, the Earl of Sunderland, yielded to his own fears. He had supported, with all his eloquence, the arguments for a standing army. He was deemed the author of the measure. He found that the Whigs and the To∣ries were alike his enemies. That the first hated him for his measures in the reign of James. That the lat∣ter abhorred him for his treachery to that Prince. He, therefore, resolved to prevent the falling of the storm, by resigning the office of lord-chamberlain<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">Dec. 26.</NOTE>, and retiring into the country.

He insinuated, at the same time, to such members as still retained some regard for the late King, that he had promised to pay to the exiled Queen her jointure, amounting to fifty thousand pounds, in consequence of an agreement with France at the treaty of Riswick. This precaution facilitated the grant of an addition of one hundred thousand pounds a year to the civil list. He, however, found means to retain, in his own hands, the money destined for the Queen. The Earl of Portland, being sent ambassador to Paris, in the beginning of the year, in∣sisted that, in the conferences between himself and the Mareschal de Boufflers, the latter had promised secretly, that King James should be removed from St. Germains.

Though he found that the party which favour∣ed the lineal succession, in the family of Bourbon, were the most numerous, they had the least credit.

But the unexpected demands of Portland obstructed, for some time, the designs of Lewis. The Earl plainly told that Prince, that he did not expect to find King James at St. Germains. He complained of that circumstance as a breach of a promise made by the Mareschal de Boufflers, in their conserences in Flanders. The Mareschal denied the

Their com∣mercial company was not only discouraged by the mi∣nistry, but even injuriously treated by William him∣self. He had made his court to the parliament of England, by disavowing, in some measure, the acts of the parliament in Scotland. He had even carried

his opposition to the new commercial company, esta∣blished by the Scots, beyond the limits of his own do∣minions. In England, the two houses of parliament had terrified the merchants from subscribing to the funds formed by the Scotish company. The jealousy of the Dutch prevented money from being found in their country. The King's resident at Hamburgh ter∣rified with menaces the merchants of that city, from performing their contract for furnishing the deputies of the company with at least two hundred thousand pounds sterling. Their remonstrances to the King, though favourably answered, produced no beneficial effect. His residents abroad were not hindred from obstructing the subscriptions solicited by the company. They even disowned the authority of the acts of par∣liament, and the letters patent upon which the Scotish company was founded<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">Petition of the gen. council to parl. 1698.</NOTE>.</P>

But the majority of their re∣presentatives were gained to the interest of the King, either by the possession or expectation of the wretched pittance of offices in the gift of the Crown. The par∣liament, it is true, addressed the King upon the sub∣ject; but in terms, that by softening the complaint, seemed little calculated either to command or expect redress. The company were also induced, by the ministry, to transmit a soothing petition of their own to William. In opposition to the public memorials presented against their deputies in Hamburgh, they requested an intimation to be made to the senate of that city, that they might enter into commerce with the Scotish company. Instead of demanding that as∣sistance from government, which had been solemnly promised by the King, they desired, only, as a mark of the royal favour, the use of two of the smallest fri∣gates that lay useless in the harbour of Burnt-island. These unmanly representations scarce deserved any re∣turn; and they received none that was favourable.

Irish affairs ex∣hibited nothing remarkable in 1697; nor in the suc∣ceeding year till the parliament met, in the end of September. The lords-justices, in their speech to that assembly, recommended to their care the settle∣ment of the linen manufacture, as more advantageous than the woollen; the latter being the staple-trade of England. They told them, that the King, since the peace, had sent into that kingdom a part of the forces who had served abroad during all the war. That he had disbanded the greatest part of the forces who had served in Ireland, with a resolution, however, to continue their subsistence to the officers. They con∣cluded with informing them, that the King expected to be enabled to support the present establishment; and that, for that purpose, an account of what the re∣venue produced for one year, from Midsummer 1697, should be laid before the house of commons<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">Journals, Sept. 27, 1698.</NOTE>.</P>

No other person born in England seems to have been trusted with a transaction, whose efficacy depended upon its being kept a profound secret. On the sixth of August, the King arrived at Loo. He was followed to that place by Tallard; and on the fifteenth of the month, the King wrote to the lord chancellor for full powers, under the great seal, with blanks for names, to treat with the French ambassa∣dor.

for land forces, his fresh demand for an increase in their number, in England, the care he took to con∣tinue the military establishments in his other king∣doms, were all calculated to raise the resentment, and to awaken the fears of parliament. The commons, in particular, were so much incensed at his speech, that, contrary to the usual custom of their house, they voted no address. Even the lords agreed not to their address till the twenty-second of December; and when pre∣sented<NOTE N="N" PLACE="foot">Jan. 3, 1699.</NOTE>, it was found to be conceived in very gene∣ral and undecisive terms.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The army reduced to seven thou∣sand men.</NOTE> When the affair of the army came under debate in the house of commons, the ministry produced no esti∣mates, and they made no proposals. The whole bu∣siness devolved on the country-party. They proposed seven thousand men, as a sufficient establishment for guards and garrisons; and they carried their motion with little difficulty. On the seventeenth of Decem∣ber, it was resolved, that all the land forces in Eng∣land, in English pay, and these natural-born subjects, should be forthwith paid and disbanded. That all the forces in Ireland, excepting twelve thousand men, and these also natural-born subjects, maintained by that kingdom, should be likewise disbanded.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">William dis∣pleased, threatens to abandon the kingdom.</NOTE> The opposition made by the friends of William, tended only to furnish his enemies with an opportuni∣ty of being severe on his character and conduct.

That he was employed neither in the concerns of the people, as King, nor in the affairs of the States, as Stadtholder. That he went merely to enjoy a lazy privacy at Loo, with a few favourites and creatures, in a manner un∣worthy of his character, and unsuitable to his digni∣ty<NOTE N="P" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. iii.</NOTE>. These open complaints and insinuations of the same kind, rendered fretful the mind of William, naturally peevish, melancholy, and severe. His de∣portment, when he was humoured the most, was stiff, ungracious, and cold. But now, his resentment had so far overcome his prudence, that he alternately yield∣ed to fits of passion, or sunk under a load of despon∣dence. He is even said to have formed a resolution of abandoning the kingdom; and that he had prepared a speech, in which he was to request of the two houses, to name such persons as they should think fit, to ma∣nage a government, that he himself was resolved no longer to hold.</P>

The private insinuations of the King were little regarded, as they were not deemed sincere. He had, twice since his expedition into England, derived advantage from the same threat. But the expedient was now too seale, either to alarm the fears of the people, or to gain the favour of parliament. Prudence, at length, overcame some part of the resentment of William. He resolved to comply with a measure, to which the two houses seemed determined to adhere. On the first of February, he came to pass the bill for disband∣ing
<PB N="150" REF="165"/>
<MILESTONE N="1699" UNIT="year"/> the army, and made a speech from the throne. He informed his parliament, that he came to pass the bill, as soon as he understood it was ready to receive his assent. That though there appeared great hazard in disbanding such a number of troops, in the present state of affairs; and that though he might think him∣self unkindly treated, in being deprived of those guards who had come along with him from Holland to the aid of England, and who had attended him in all the actions in which he had been engaged, yet, being convinced of the fatal consequences of any jealousies that might arise between himself and his people, he was resolved, for that reason only, to give his concur∣rence to the bill. He, however, informed them, that he thought himself obliged, for his own justification, and in discharge of the trust reposed in his hands, to declare plainly his judgment, that the nation was left too much exposed. He deemed it, therefore, incum∣bent upon them, as the representatives of the people, to provide such a force as should be necessary for the safety of the kingdom, and the preservation of the peace of Europe.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Solicits them for his Dutch guards in vain.</NOTE> The commons, in some measure, complied with William's desire, with regard to the security of the nation.

The necessary orders were, in the mean time, issued for disbanding the army. But his predilection for his favourite Dutch guards, recurred again to the King's mind. On the eighteenth of March he sent a message, written in his own hand, to the house of commons, by the Earl of Ranelagh, paymaster-general of the forces<NOTE N="S" PLACE="foot">March 18.</NOTE>. He told them, that the necessary preparations were made for transporting the guards, who came with him to England. That he intended to send them away im∣mediately from the kingdom, unless the house, out of consideration to him, should finds means to continue them longer in his service: a measure which his Ma∣jesty<NOTE N="Q" PLACE="foot">Journals, Feb. 1, 1699.</NOTE>
<PB N="151" REF="166"/>
would construe into an act of great kindness. This condescending expedient produced no favourable effect on the commons. The question, that a day should be appointed for considering the message, was carried in the negative. A committee was appointed to frame an address, representing the reasons why the commons could not comply. The address was accord∣ingly presented on the twenty-fourth of March. The answer of William contained a recapitulation of his own services to the nation, his confidence in their fidelity to his person, and his resolution to preserve entire the constitution which he had restored<NOTE N="T" PLACE="foot">March 24.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Parliament prorogued.</NOTE> The provision made by the commons, for the ef∣fectual reduction of the army, was the last business of importance in this refractory session. The two houses, however, continued to sit till the fourth of May. Though William yielded to his prudence, he could neither conceal his resentment nor suppress his com∣plaints, for the unkind treatment which he had re∣ceived from the commons. He furnished an example of both in his speech from the throne, when he pro∣rogued the parliament. In any light in which the subject is viewed, the King had little reason to be pleased. But the sallies of passion, into which he is said to have fallen, require better authorities than those by which they are supported, to be implicitly believed. His disappointments throughout furnished matter of triumph to his enemies. But they dwelt with most malevolence, on the supposed meanness of his message to the commons, in favour of his Dutch guards. The conduct of the commons cannot, how∣ever, be disapproved. Though no danger ought, per∣haps, to be apprehended from such an insignificant number of foreigners; there was a kind of necessary dignity, in committing entirely to the natives, the se∣curity of a free country.</P>

The empti∣ness of his coffers, the discontents of his subjects, the seditious humour of the Janisaries, had involved the latter Prince in unsurmountable difficulties, and had rendered him utterly incapable of recovering in the summer of 1698, the laurels which he had lost in the preceding campaign<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">Hist. de France, tom. iii.</NOTE>. The eyes of both parties being turned to the same object, they contented them∣selves with covering their respective frontiers with their armies. A similar inactivity had subsisted, during the summer, between the Russians and the Porte, on the side of the Lesser Tartary; and though the Ve∣netians had obtained some advantages in the Archipe∣lago, their operations produced no effect on the cor∣dial desire exhibited by all parties, for entering into conferences for restoring peace<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">Hist.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace be∣tween the Emperor and the Porte.</NOTE> The King of England and the States of the United Provinces had offered, by their ambassadors, their mediation to the belligerent powers.

De Fe∣riole, who had succeeded Châteauneuf, in the ma∣nagement of the affairs of France at the Porte, made various but vain efforts, to persuade the Turks to continue the war<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. The treaty was signed, on the twenty-sixth of January, by the plenipotentiaries of Mustapha the Second, the Emperor Leopold, the King of Poland, and the Czar of Moscovy; and, soon after, by those of the republic of Venice. All Hungary, on this side of the Saave, with Transyl∣vania and Sclavonia, were ceded to the house of Austria. The Czar remained in possession of Azoph. Caminiec was restored to the Poles. The Venetians were gratified with all the Morea, and several places in Dalmatia; and, thus, a temporary tranquillity was restored, though the seeds of discord were already sown in all the corners of Europe<NOTE N="E" PLACE="foot">Hist du Nord, tom. ii.</NOTE>.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first partition treaty de∣feated.</NOTE> The treaty of partition, which the King of Eng∣land concluded with France, at the peril of the utmost resentment of his subjects, was suddenly rendered use∣less, by a co-incidence of events. The King of Spain, contrary to the expectations of all Europe, recovered, in some degree, from his illness; and the electoral Prince of Bavaria, whom the treaty of partition and the will of Charles the Second, had destined for the throne of Spain and the Indies, died at Brussels, on the eighth of February<NOTE N="F" PLACE="foot">N. S.</NOTE>. The Elector, disap∣pointed in the views of his ambition, attributed the death of his son to more than his distemper. But, as he produced no proofs, his suspicions were ascribed to grief, more than to any just grounds of complaint. Though provision had been made, by a secret stipu∣lation, to substitute the father in the place of the son, upon the eventual death of the latter, that article of the treaty, as it was founded upon no pretensions pos∣sessed by the Elector, was equally disregarded by both the contracting powers. France shewed an inclination to propose a new convention to the King of England, on the plan of the former treaty. But though Wil∣liam entertained a design of renewing his engage∣ments, the moment he heard of the death of the Prince<NOTE N="G" PLACE="foot">De Torcy, vol. i.</NOTE>, his embarrassment, with regard to the disagreeable proceedings of parliament, drove all other thoughts from his mind, during the sitting of that assembly.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">William <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ens to another.</NOTE> The leisure necessary for the settlement of foreign affairs, was fought after by William in Holland. Having made several changes in the ministry, and de∣clared a regency to govern the kingdom in his absence, he left Kensington, on the first of June; and in the evening of the third, arrived at the Hague. On the twenty second of June, he left that place and retired to Loo; where, and at Dieren, he spent the most part of the season, in his favourite diversion of hunt∣ing. Tallard, who had managed so successfully the treaty of the preceding year, was ordered, by hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> court, to repair to Loo, in the beginning of July, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ttle measures, as they were called, for preserving
<PB N="155" REF="170"/>
the tranquillity of Europe. William, very early in the year, had given orders of the same kind to his am∣bassador at Paris. He approved, therefore, with lit∣tle difficulty of the scheme proposed by de Tallard. That Spain and the Indies should be left to the Arch-duke. That the duchy of Milan should be added to the portion intended for the Dauphin; and that the Netherlands should be settled in such a manner, as might entirely prevent any jealousy in England or um∣brage in Holland<NOTE N="H" PLACE="foot">De Torcy, vol. i.</NOTE>,</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Intelligence of his views sent to Spain.</NOTE> This negociation, though committed only to a few individuals, continued not long a secret from the world. The Spanish ambassador at the Hague, sent intelli∣gence, by a courier, to Madrid. The court was alarmed. The King himself, in the midst of his weakness, was highly offended at a measure which hurt his pride. He remonstrated, in the strongest terms, against the behaviour of William to his am∣bassador at Madrid. He ordered the Marquis de Ca∣nailles, his own minister at London, to represent in England his high displeasure at the indignity offered to himself and his crown. The Marquis, in his memo∣rial to the lords of the regency, followed the dictates of his own malignity, more than the interest of his sovereign. He told them, that his master had been informed, that William, the Dutch, and other pow∣ers, were actually hatching new treaties, for the suc∣cession of the crown of Spain; and, what was equally detestable, contriving the division and repartition of the Spanish territories. That his Majesty had given orders, to represent the injustice of their King, to the ministers and lords of England. That if such things were allowed, no nation, no dominion could be safe, against the ambition of the strongest, and the deceits of the most malicious. That should strangers be permitted to put their hands in the lines of succes∣sion of Kings, no statutes, no municipal laws would be observed. That no crown could be free from the attempts of aliens; and the crown of England less than any crown. That were men to lie watching for the

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An insolent memorial by the Spanish am∣bassador.</NOTE> The Marquis descended from general observations to particular facts. He informed the lords of the re∣gency, that it ought not to have been presumed, that the King of Spain had not taken proper measures against all accidents that might disturb the public peace, and break the repose of Europe. That unless a stop should be put to these sinister proceedings, these clan∣destine machinations, these unjust projects, an univer∣sal war must be the consequence throughout Europe. That such a misfortune would be highly prejudicial to the people of England, who had lately tried and felt the inconvenience of novelties, and the insupportable burden of the consequent war. That this latter cir∣cumstance was so obvious, that the memorialist doubt∣ed not but it must be owned by the parliament, the no∣bility, and all the English nation. That the same na∣tion must consider their own interest, their trade and their treaties with Spain, the danger arising to these, from a division and separation of the Spanish mo∣narchy; and that nothing can prevent these misfor∣tunes but their disappointing the project already begun at Loo, and their determining not to help forward novelties, ever supremely hurtful to all sovereignties and empires. He concluded with assuring the regen∣cy, that the King his master, would render manifest to the parliament of England, when that assembly should meet, the just resentment which he now ex∣pressed to their lordships.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He is order∣ed to depart the king∣dom.</NOTE> This insolent memorial was transmitted to William, before any answer was made by the regency. The King was not of a complexion either to admit of appeals from the prerogatives of the Crown to the represen∣tatives of the nation, or to suffer any reflections against his own right to the throne. He ordered Mr. secre∣tary Vernon to signify to the Spanish ambassador, that he must depart the kingdom precisely in eighteen days. That, in the mean time, he should confine himself to his house; and that no writing should be any more

received either from himself or any of his domestics. The King, at the same time, ordered his ambassador at the court of Madrid to complain of the affront of∣fered to his person, and the reflections thrown on his government. He endeavoured to exempt the King of Spain from having any share in the outrage com∣mitted by his ambassador. But that Prince made him∣self a party in the dispute, by ordering the English am∣bassador to depart the kingdom within the same space of time that had been limited by William to the Mar∣quis de Canailles.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of the North.</NOTE> These disputes between William and Spain, neither hastened nor retarded the second treaty of partition, which that Prince concluded the next year with France. His attention was not confined to the subject of the Spanish succession, though the declining health of Charles the Second threatened Europe with those mi∣series which it then feared, and soon after experienced from his death. The King employed his good offices in suppressing a flame, which seemed ready to be kind∣led in the North. Christian the Fifth, King of Den∣mark, dying on the fourth of September, was suc∣ceeded in the throne by his son Frederic the fourth. Frederic inheriting the resentment, and pursuing the designs of his father against the Duke of Holstein-Got∣torp, began to make great preparations, both by sea and land, to reduce that Prince to those terms which he pretended to have a right to exact. The Duke on the other hand, had strengthened his interest by a marriage with the Princess-Royal of Sweden. He himself was commander in chief of the troops of that kingdom; and he had obtained a force from his bro∣ther-in-law, Charles the Twelfth, to defend himself against the designs of Denmark. William, in his double capacity of King of England, and Stadtholder of the United Provinces, considered himself as gua∣rantee of the treaty of Altena; and, to secure the tranquillity of the North, he proposed that the Swe∣dish troops should retire from Holstein. The King of Sweden and the Duke accepted the proposal of the mediator. But the King of Denmark, having pri∣vately entered into an alliance, against Sweden, with

the King of Poland, and Peter Alexiowitz, Czar of Muscowy, exacted terms so exorbitant, that it was apparent he meant nothing less than to preserve the peace<NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">Hist. de Suede, tom. ii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of the Scotish company.</NOTE> While William extended his care to the interest of other nations, he neglected, in a scarce pardonable de∣gree, the protection of a part of his own subjects.

The Spaniards had not yet complained of any encroachments on their territories. William, by evasive answers to the re∣presentations of the Scots, had, in a manner, prevent∣ed them from providing against a hardship, which no subjects, acting under the authority of the law, had any reason to fear from their sovereign. To compleat the misfortune, the King listened to the complaints of the Spaniards<NOTE N="M" PLACE="foot">May 3, 1699.</NOTE>, against an ill-fated body of ad∣venturers, already perishing in their own folly.

On the fifteenth of January, Mr. Montagu, in a fit of indiscreet zeal, informed the commons, that a member of the house, in a letter to the commissioners, had directed them to make a separate article of the Countess of Orkney's grant; because that circumstance would reflect on a CERTAIN PERSON. Montagu explained this certain person into the King. The house ordered him to make good his charge. He endeavoured, in vain, to avoid an answer. But being threatened with the Tow∣er, he named Methuen, lord-chancellor of Ireland, as the informer. Methuen denied the charge. Monta∣gu became the victim of his own zeal; and the com∣mons voted that his report was false and scandalous. They resolved, at the same time, that the four com∣missioners, who had signed the report concerning the Irish forfeitures, had acquitted themselves with under∣standing, courage, and integrity. They, at the same time, committed Sir Richard Leving to the Tower, as a person who had thrown a groundless and scanda∣lous aspersion on the four commissioners<NOTE N="W" PLACE="foot">Journals, Jan. 1700.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They tack the bill of resumption to the sup∣ply.</NOTE> Though the court-party were, almost in every question, the minority, they endeavoured to defeat, in part, the bill of resumption, by proposing a clause, for reserving a proportion of the forfeitures to the dis∣posal of the King. The house, not content with put∣ting a negative on this motion, resolved that the ad∣vising, procuring, and passing the grants for the for∣feited estates, and others in Ireland, had been the oc∣casion of contracting great debts upon the nation, and laying heavy taxes on the people; and that the pas∣sing of these grants highly reflected on the King's ho∣nour<NOTE N="X" PLACE="foot">Jan. 18.</NOTE>. While the commons exhibited this spirit of refractoriness, the affair of the supply for the current service commanded a part of their care.

In a narrow inspection of every branch of the revenue, a great loss to the public was discovered in the collection of the excise.

The grand committee for trade had ex∣amined into several piracies, comitted in the East Indies, by one Captain Kidd and his crew. On this examination it appeared, that William had inadvert∣ently made himself a kind of party in the affair, by signing a warrant, for the granting of pirates-goods to the Earl of Bellamount and several others. The com∣mons sent an address to the throne, that Kidd, who was ordered home from America, should not be tried, discharged, or pardoned, until the next session of par∣liament. This conduct in the house shewed a distrust of the King, which raised his resentment, as it hurt his pride.

Many disapproved of the pre∣cedent of tacking a foreign clause to a money-bill, as reducing the peers to a subserviency to the factions and views of the commons. But the force of both parties, when joined, was not sufficient to reject the bill. Amendments were, however, made with regard to the Irish forfeitures. But these amendments were

unanimously disapproved by the lower house. Con∣ference succeeded conference. The commons were in a ferment. They spoke of impeaching the Earls of Portland and Albemarle. They shut themselves up, after the second conference with the lords, till ten at night; and seemed determined on the harshest means to force the court-party into compliance. In this important interval, the house resolved to address the King, that no person, not a native of his domi∣nions, except Prince George of Denmark, should be admitted to his councils either in England or Ire∣land<NOTE N="E" PLACE="foot">April 10.</NOTE>. William was not of a complexion to give a favourable answer, nor was he in a condition to refuse the demands of the exasperated commons. He sent a private message to his friends among the lords, to sus∣pend their opposition. The bill was immediately passed, without amendments; and to prevent the fall∣ing of the threatened storm, he came suddenly to the house, gave his assent to the act of resumption, and prorogued the parliament<NOTE N="F" PLACE="foot">April 11.</NOTE>, without any speech from the throne.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of the Scotish company.</NOTE> While William was harassed in one of his king∣doms, by a violent and successful opposition in parlia∣ment, he was perlexed in another, by vehement in∣stances for redress.

That it was his firm intention to advance the trade of Scotland; and that the subjects of that kingdom should enjoy the same liberty of commerce, that others enjoyed in the English plantations. The company, however, were resolved not to relin∣quish their purpose. They wrote to the chancellor. They sent a letter to Lord Basil Hamilton. They requested the first to use his best endeavours for obtaining admittance for the noble person whom they had employed. They approved of the conduct of the latter; and ascribed their disappointment to a dis∣like to their own cause, more than to any objection entertained by the King against his person<NOTE N="H" PLACE="foot">Letter to the Chancellor.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Opposed by the King.</NOTE> Embarrassed with complaints and teazed by en∣treaties, William endeavoured to get rid of the Scots, with the sanction of the English parliament. The commons being so refractory, the first application was made to the lords. Neither the influence of the crown, nor the prejudices of the house, against the new company, were capable of carrying the point against the Scots, without violent debates and long de∣lays. An address was, at length, sent down to the commons, for their concurrence. But the commons were not in the humour of being complaisant to the King. The enemies of William were pleased to see his affairs embroiled. Some apprehended, that there was a design to involve the two kingdoms in a quarrel; that the King might derive, from the necessity of the nation, that increase of the land forces, which had been so often denied to his earnest solicitations to par∣liament. The leaders of opposition were, by no means, inclined to remove the general discontent which had soured the temper of the Scots, against the King. The disaffected members, in the mean time, propagated a report, that the opposition of the King to the Scotish company, proceeded neither from a regard to foreign treaties nor domestic advantage, but from an affection for the Dutch, whose trade along the Spanish main was in danger of being ruined,

by the establishment of a new colony at Darien<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. iii.</NOTE>.

This irregular petition produced nothing but an ad∣ditional disappointment. The King made answer, that the parliament should not meet till the fourteenth of May.

He was at no pains to conceal his resolution to defeat the bill of resumption, by refusing his assent should it pass the house of lords. He became sullen, melan∣choly, and discontented. His resentment broke forth frequently in a manner inconsistent with his prudence. He either apprehended not the dangers, in which the votes of the commons might terminate; or he was not much concerned where they might end<NOTE N="L" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. iii.</NOTE>. He even seemed indifferent about possessing the name of King, after the authority, which he deemed to be in∣herent in that capacity, had vanished from his hands; and had not the safety of those whom he favoured most depended on his compliance, he would not pro∣bably have suppressed the rage against the commons, which his enemies hoped he was to have carried to extremity. They perceived, that should he quarrel with the commons, he would lose what still remained of the affections of his people.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A change in the ministry.</NOTE> The recess of parliament, as it freed William from daily mortifications, encouraged him to endeavour to prevent the return of the disagreeable measures which had so much disturbed his repose.

He was a man of abilities, in his profession; but his parts were more solid than brilliant, or even clear. He was rather a good chancellor than a great statesman. His integrity and diligence in office, were, with reason, commend∣ed. He was too diffident, and too compliant with the King, to make any splendid figure, beyond his own line of the law. His complaisance to the King's hu∣mour, his flattering him in his very errors, his feeble manner of recommending what seemed right to his own judgment, bore more the appearance of a convenient than of an able servant. Upon the whole, he seemed more calculated to smoothe the current of business, by amending and softening measures already adopt∣ed, than to propose and execute those spirited and manly expedients, which times of faction seem to de∣mand at the hands of a great minister. The difficulty which William encountered in supplying properly the place<NOTE N="O" PLACE="foot">May 20.</NOTE> of Somers, argued that his dismission of that lord was a precipitate measure; while, at the same time, he was justly censured, for throwing a kind of disgrace on a servant, who had served him with fide∣lity in perilous times.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Treaty with Sweden.</NOTE> While William seemed to provide for the repose of the south of Europe, he extended his care to the tran∣quillity of the north. The young King of Sweden, apprehensive of a storm, which already began to break on his dominions, entered into a new defensive treaty with the maritime powers. The contracting parties became reciprocally guarantees of all their dominions. Charles the Twelfth engaged to furnish the King of England with ten thousand men, to be paid by the lat∣ter Prince, should he find himself obliged to take arms in support of the treaty of Riswick. England and the States, as guarantees of the treaty of Altena, between the King of Denmark and the Duke of Holstein-Gos∣torp, seem to have agreed, though not in an express article, to aid Charles with a strong squadron of ships of war, when attacked by his enemies. The treaty was signed on the thirteenth of January; and the re∣quisition, or rather the application for the ships, was made in March<NOTE N="R" PLACE="foot">Hist. du Nord. tom. ii<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/></NOTE>. William, in a bad humour with his refractory parliament, gave orders for pre∣paring a squadron, without either communicating to them his intentions, or demanding a supply. The first would be imprudent, in the untoward humour of of the times, as England was little concerned in the affairs of the North; and the latter would most cer∣tainly be refused, considering the general resolution, formed by the commons, for diminishing the expences of the nation.</P>

The Danes, led by the Duke of Wertemberg, invaded Holstein; and having seized some inconsiderable forts, sat down before Tonningen. The strength of the place, the conduct of the governor, the unskilfulness of the besiegers, an unsuccessful assault, and the march of the troops of Brunswick-Lunenburgh, who had passed the Elb, induced the Danes to relinquish their designs on Tonningen, and to retreat towards their own frontiers. A combined squadron of English and Dutch men of war, with fire-ships and bomb-vessels, under the admirals Rooke and Allemonde, arrived, on the twentieth of July, at the mouth of the Sound<NOTE N="T" PLACE="foot">July 20.</NOTE>.

French King, and, at the same time, ordered the will to be delivered to that Prince, by the Spanish ambassa∣dor residing at his court. Lewis consulted his council; in which it was resolved to drop the second partition treaty, and to adhere to the testament of the late King of Spain. A war, it had been always foreseen, was the inevitable consequence of the death of that Prince; and the court of France wisely concluded, that it was much easier to keep possession of the whole kingdom, by virtue of the will, than to conquer and retain the share allotted to the Dauphin, by the treaty concluded with England and the States<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">De Torcy. tom. i.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lewis XIV. accepts the will.</NOTE> Lewis the Fourteenth joined to these reasons, one other of equal weight. Should he refuse the bequest made to his grandson of the crown, all the dominions of Spain must have fallen into the hands of the Em∣peror, the hereditary rival of the power of his family. The very courier that brought the will to France, had been ordered, in case of the refusal of that court, to proceed to Vienna, with a tender of the throne to the Archduke. This circumstance would have again re∣vived the power possessed, by the house of Austria, in the days of Charles the Fifth, when the united weight of Spain and the empire had almost proved fatal to the French monarchy. These reasons coinciding with the ambition of Lewis, he flattered himself, that the war, which must otherwise have been kindled in Europe, was least to be dreaded on the grounds which he now had chosen. The resolution adopted for accepting the will in France, was followed by the precaution of form∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng alliances abroad.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A new par∣liament in England.</NOTE> On the sixth of February, the new parliament met at Westminster, but, under the pretence of giving time to the members to arrive in town, they were ad∣journed to the tenth of the same month. The com∣mons having presented Mr. Harley, whom they had chosen for their speaker, the King made a speech to both houses, from the throne. He told them, that the great misfortune of the nation, in the death of the Duke of Gloucester, had rendered it absolutely neces∣sary to make a further provision for the succession in the Protestant line. He earnestly recommended that measure to their earliest care, as the happiness of the nation and the security of religion, depended on an im∣mediate and proper settlement of the crown. The death of the King of Spain, he said, and the declara∣tion of his successor, had made so great an alteration in foreign affairs, that he desired the parliament to consider very maturely their present state; and that he doubted not, but their resolutions would conduce to the interest and safety of England, the preservation of the Protestant religion, and the peace of all Europe. These things, he continued, were of such weight, that he had called a new parliament, to obtain the more immediate sense of the kingdom in such an im∣portant conjuncture. He recommended to the com∣mons to provide for the late deficiencies and the un∣funded debts, to inspect the state and augment the strength of the navy, and to deliberate on the regula∣tion and improvement of trade.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mutual ani∣mosities of the Whigs and Tories.</NOTE> The animosities of parties, the prospect of advan∣tage, which arose to the members of the lower house, from the very misfortunes of their constituents; and above all, the importance which the commons had lately acquired by their successful opposition to the crown, had rendered seats in parliament uncommon objects of contest, during the late elections. Bribery and corruption, perhaps never absent entirely from such occasions, had arrived at a pitch too indecent to be overlooked, had even those, who were rivals for the suffrages of the people, been less inflamed against one another's conduct. The first care of the commons, as is usual in new parliaments, was turned to undue

The Tories having dis∣covered their superiority, by the election of a speaker of their own party, are said to have used their power in a manner less suitable to justice, than to their own prejudices against the Whigs; and to have, thus, weakened still more their opponents, by depriving many of them of their seats in the house. But the charge of injustice might probably have been trans∣ferred to the other side, had their power equalled their animosity against their rivals.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Articles for the security of the sub∣ject.</NOTE> In a committee of the whole house, the commons came to further important resolutions, which were re∣ported; and, with a few amendments, approved, on the twelfth of March.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">as the Pro∣testant near est to the crown.</NOTE> The Princess Sophia, thus eventually elected to succeed to the throne of England, was the nearest person of the royal line, who was not already under a legal incapacity of possessing the crown. An express act of parliament had excluded all Roman Catholics from the succession; and all the descendants of Charles the First, except William and the Princess of Den∣mark, were of the Popish persuasion. The parlia∣ment, therefore, were obliged to return to the poste∣rity of James the First in another line; and to Sophia, as grand-daughter to that Prince, by his daughter Elizabeth, who had been married to the unfortunate King of Bohemia. Though the same power which conferred on the Princess the succession of the Crown, might, with equal justice, have placed any other per∣son on the throne, the parliament chose to adhere, in some degree, to the royal blood, as committing the least outrage on monarchy, to which a majority of themselves were attached from principle. A different conduct might, for a time, have deprived the elected Sovereign of the reverence which most men, born under monarchies, pay to the hereditary line. But the influence arising from the disposal of an immense revenue, had, even then, placed the power of the Sovereign on a much more solid foundation, than the seeble prerogative derived, by hereditary princes, from the opinion of the people.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections.</NOTE> This consideration had certainly its weight with the present parliament, in limiting the force of the execu∣tive power, in the settlement of the succession. As the crown which they conferred was a voluntary gift, they had a right, if they chose, to deprive it of its unnecessary ornaments, and even of some of its jewels. But power had turned it into another channel; and the mounds which were reared, became, in a manner, useless, as the waters ceased to rise on that side. The
<PB N="189" REF="204"/>
Crown was destined, from the very exertions made by the people against its exorbitant claims, to acquire in influence, what it lost in prerogative. Authority, by these means, lost gradually its terrors and its insolence. Power had ceased to be splendid; but it became per∣manent and irresistible: and mankind may be imper∣ceptibly surrounded with the toils of despotism, while they have the vanity to think themselves free.</P>

It, however, had been evident, that the King wished least for their assistance in the latter line. But the majority seemed by no means willing to gratify their Sovereign, in the point of an immediate increase of the land-forces of the kingdom. In their measures consequent upon the resolution of adhering to the treaty with the Dutch in 1677, the commons made a shew of aiding the King, without offending the nation. They resolved, that twelve battalions, then in Ireland, should be made up, with new levies, to ten thousand men; and sent to the aid of the States.

Hav∣ing, in a committee of the whole house, examined the treaties of partition, they agreed upon an address, containing bitter reflections on their tendency. They complained, that the last treaty with the French King, had been huddled up without being laid before parliament, though then actually sitting; and even

without being considered in council; circumstances as unjust in their nature, as the measures themselves were fatal in their consequences.

That the ces∣sion of Sicily, Naples, several ports in the Mediter∣ranean, the province of Guipuscoa, and the duchy of Lorrain, as stipulated, in favour of France, by the last treaty, was contrary to the pretence of the treaty itself; the professed object of which was, the peace and safety of Europe. They requested his Majesty to require and admit, for the future, in all matters of importance, the advice of his natural born subjects; and, for that purpose, to constitute a council, to whom all such foreign and domestic affairs as concerned either his Majesty or his dominions, might be referred<NOTE N="V" PLACE="foot">Journals of the lords.</NOTE>.

The King, to avoid any contest with the commons, passed over the address of the peers in silence.

The Whigs and Tories were inflamed against each other to such a degree of inveteracy, and they were also so equally poised, that without declaring for either, he had a prospect of commanding both parties. Some leaders of each side were still in office. But he chose to make no advances to the Whigs, nor to gratify the Tories. The two factions took different ways to ob∣tain the management of government. The first de∣parted from their principles, in their endeavours to gain the King. The latter seemed rather inclined to owe their influence to their sovereign's fear of their power. William, all the while, observed a profound silence; and even after the prorogation of parliament, when he resolved to pass over into Holland, he left the government in such mixed hands, that no judgment could be formed to which party he most inclined.</P>

Having brought to great forwardness, a perpetual alliance between the English and the Dutch, for the recovery and preser∣vation of Flanders, he embarked, on the fourteenth of November, and landed, the next day, at Margate. In England, during the King's absence, nothing re∣markable happened, except the ferment which the transactions of the preceding session had raised between the parties. Having carried their contests into the press, the people, as is usual, when their passions are inflamed, were vehemently agitated between the arguments and declamations of the two great parties, the Whigs and the Tories<NOTE N="Q" PLACE="foot">Publications of the times.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Contests between parties.</NOTE> The Whigs, however, more active or more deter∣mined than their opponents, had the address to turn the opinions of the people to forward their own de∣signs. The declaration of the French King, for the title of the Prince of Wales, was an incident too fa∣vourable to their views, to be dropt without being used. The vulgar were easily persuaded, that those who opposed the measures of the Crown in parliament, were enemies to the King; and they were loud in their complaints against the proceedings and conduct of the house of commons. The severity of that assem∣bly to the Kentish petitioners, their contests with the lords, their animadversions on the foreign transactions of government were magnified, and introduced as proofs of their attachment to the exiled family. The late settlement of the crown in the Protestant line, the limitations, highly favourable to the liberties of the people, imposed upon the eventual succession of a fo∣reign family, were either entirely forgot or totally mis∣represented. Addresses to William, upon the insult offered by France, were transmitted to him in Hol∣land. Flattery, absurdity, and folly, as is usual, abounded in these unmeaning productions. But they served the purpose of the King, who had resolved to meet no more a parliament, that had already shewn so

much aversion to the war in which he was now irreco∣verably engaged.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of the North.</NOTE> On the thirteenth of November, the parliament was dissolved, by proclamation; and writs were issued for another to meet, at Westminster, on the thirtieth of December. The contests usual in all elections, were carried to a height proportionable to the violence and animosity of parties acting on the prejudices of the vulgar. Noise and tumult filled every corner of Eng∣land, while every State in the North and West of Europe were indefatigably preparing to take arms. The kingdoms of the East were still engaged in the war which Charles the Twelfth of Sweden had kin∣dled, in the preceding year, to frustrate the unjust combination of his neighbours against his kingdom. The defeat of the Russians, in the battle of Narva, had rendered that active and gallant Prince a conquer∣or the more formidable, that he seemed eager with new exploits to eclipse the glory of the old. His victories in Poland were as rapid as the march of his troops. The Russians were every where routed, as soon as seen; and the King himself, having passed the Duna, in the sight of the enemy, and totally defeated the Saxons, formed, at Birzen, the resolution of de∣priving King Augustus of the throne of Poland<NOTE N="R" PLACE="foot">Hist. du Nord, tom. ii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A new par∣liament.</NOTE> The new parliament met, on the thirtieth of De∣cember; and the commons, from their first measure, seemed to have brought into their house, all the ani∣mosities which had inflamed their constituents during the election.

whose reign was apparently drawing to its end. Their conduct, however, had already been so much resented by the King, that he resolved to place his whole con∣fidence in the Whigs. He dismissed Sir Charles Hedges from the office of secretary of state; in which the Earl of Manchester, lately returned from his em∣bassy in France, was placed. The Earl of Carlisle supplanted the Lord Godolphin, at the head of the treasury. The Earl of Pembroke, supposed to be a Whig, though he had actually corresponded with King James<NOTE N="T" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers.</NOTE>, was soon after made lord high-admiral of England; and the Duke of Somerset, not much more averse to the old cause, succeeded Pembroke as pre∣sident of the council.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">King's speech.</NOTE> The commons having presented their speaker, the King made a speech to both houses from the throne. He promised himself, he said, that they were met to∣gether full of a just sense of the danger of Europe, and a high resentment of the late proceeding of the French King. He expatiated upon the indignity offered to himself and the nation, in owning and setting up the pretended Prince of Wales as King of England; and he recommended to them to consider, what further effectual means might be used, to secure the succession of the crown in the Protestant line. He complained, that the French King, by placing his grandson on the throne of Spain, had furnished himself with the means of oppressing Europe; and that he had surrounded his neighbours in such a manner, that though the name of peace had still continued, other States were put to all the inconvenience and expence of war. He enlarged on what England had to fear from the power of the house of Bourbon; and he informed the houses, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o obviate the general calamity which threatened Christendom, he had concluded several alliances, ac∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ording to the encouragement given him by both houses <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f parliament.

He concluded his speech with various arguments for their unanimity; and he hoped, as he himself was de∣sirous of being the common father of all his people, they would, on their side, lay aside parties, divisions, and animosities<NOTE N="U" PLACE="foot">Journals, Dec 31.</NOTE>.</P>

The lords addressed the King in the warmest and most affectionate terms. The com∣mons, without one dissenting voice, voted the supply. Instead of being offended at the treaty which was to engage the nation in an immediate war, they addressed the throne, that no peace should be made with France, till reparation should be made to the King and the na∣tion, for her owning and declaring the pretended Prince of Wales King of England<NOTE N="V" PLACE="foot">Journals, Jan. 10, 170.</NOTE>.

<MILESTONE N="1702" UNIT="year"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King falls from his horse.</NOTE> During proceedings so friendly to the designs of the Crown, the King himself became sensible, that he was not destined, in person, to carry into execution, the great schemes which he had formed. He, howe∣ver, endeavoured to conceal the declining state of his health, to accomplish, with more facility, his favou∣rite views. A fortunate coincidence of circumstances, had thrown the opinions of the people into the same channel with his own. The parties, in parliament, were so well poised, that in a mutual fear of each other, they both courted the King. The animosities which had always embroiled and embarrassed his mea∣sures, were suspended; and he had the satisfaction to have one glimpse of serenity, in the evening of a tem∣pestuous reign. To continue a calm so favourable to his scheme of embarking England in the war, he spread reports of his recovery. But an accident acce∣lerated that dissolution, which was apparently ad∣vancing, though by slow degrees. On the twenty-first of February, willing still to continue his usual diversion of hunting, he mounted his horse, though in a languishing state of health, and riding out from Kensington towards Hampton-court, the horse fell, and in his fall, his Majesty broke his right collar-bone. He was carried to Hampton-court, and the bone was set; but, contrary to advice, he returned the same evening, in his coach to Kensington.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His death.</NOTE> This accident, though it might have hastened the death of William, bore, for some time, no appear∣ance of proving fatal. On the twenty-eighth of Fe∣bruary, the Gazette declared, in express terms, that the King was perfectly recovered; and, on the same day, he sent a message to both houses, concerning an union between the kingdoms of England and Scotland. On the first of March, the bill for attainting the pre∣tended Prince of Wales, received the royal assent by commission. On the second day of that month, such symptoms appeared, that all hopes of the King's re∣covery were lost. A defluxion fell upon his knee. The asthma, to which he had been always subject, increased. He breathed short, and he was restless and feverish. The two houses, in the mean time,
<PB N="208" REF="223"/>
continued to sit. The council was assembled to receive the reports of the physicians. But, even in that ex∣tremity, it was maliciously remarked, that no English∣man of quality had any access to the King's chamber. About five in the morning, of Sunday the eighth of March, his Majesty received the sacrament, from the hands of the Archbishop of Canterbury; and at eight he expired, in the arms of one of his pages. Some papers, which might throw considerable light on the history of this Prince, were, with his last breath, consigned to the hands of the Earl of Albemarle; and they were probably destroyed by that lord. Albe∣marle, whose original office was that of a transcriber of letters, had been employed, in the preceding month, on a service of the same kind. He had returned, on the seventeenth of February, from Holland, with all the secret correspondences which had passed between the King and the Pensionary, under the supposition, that the latter was also dying.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections.</NOTE> Though the character given of the Prince of Orange<NOTE N="X" PLACE="foot">Vol. i. p. 163.</NOTE>, in an early period of his life, ran through the whole conduct of King William, when he sat on the throne of England, some new and striking features were called forth, by the extraordinary events which filled his reign. His political conduct, and the dispo∣sition of his mind, have been variously and oppositely represented: a thing not surprising, in a country where writers have not been able to divest themselves of the prejudices and partialities incident to party. In such a jarring state of opinions, this Prince must have been too much praised by the one side, and by the other as extravagantly condemned. The nearest path to truth, must certainly lie between these two extremes. But that path, though obvious, has not, hitherto, been trod by historians; who have uniformly yielded to the prejudices of others, or have been swayed by their own. Their proximity to the period concerning which they wrote, may form, for many, a compleat excuse The passions of party, came glowing down on the current of the times. Authors caught the heat of those with whom they themselves were most connected in

life; and became, inadvertently, and sometimes de∣signedly, partial, through a weakness which they un∣justly dignified with the name of principle.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His person,</NOTE> William the Third, King of Great Britain and Ireland, was in his person of a middle size, ill-shaped in his limbs, somewhat round in the shoulders, light∣brown in the colour of his hair and in his complexion. The lines of his face were hard, and his nose aquiline. But a good and penetrating eye threw a kind of light on his countenance, which tempered its severity, and rendered his harsh features, in some measure, agree∣able. Though his constitution was weak, delicate and infirm, he loved the manly exercises of the field; and often indulged himself in the pleasures, and even, sometimes, in the excesses of the table. In his pri∣vate character, he was frequently harsh, passionate, and severe, with regard to trifles. But when the sub∣ject rose equal to his mind, and in the tumult of bat∣tle, he was dignified, cool, and serene. Though he was apt to form bad impressions, which were not easily removed, he was neither vindictive in his disposition, nor obstinate in his resentment. Neglected in his education, and, perhaps, destitute by nature of an elegance of mind, he had no taste for literature, none for the sciences, none for the beautiful arts. He paid no attention to music, he understood no poetry. He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isregarded learning. He encouraged no men of let∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers, no painters, no artists of any kind.

These defects, rather than vices of the mind,

combining with an indifference about humouring man∣kind through their ruling passions, rendered him ex∣tremely unfit for gaining the affections of the English nation. His reign, therefore, was crowded with mortifications of various kinds. The discontented parties among his subjects, found no difficulty in estranging the minds of the people from a Prince pos∣sessed of few talents to make him popular. He was trusted, perhaps, less than he deserved, by the most obsequious of his parliaments; but it seems, upon the whole, apparent, that the nation adhered to his government, more from a fear of the return of his predecessor, than from any attachment to his own person, or respect for his right to the throne.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His public conduct.</NOTE> These harsh features of the mind of King William presented themselves only to those who took a near and critical view of his conduct. To men who ob∣served him at a distance, and as a principal object in the great scale of Europe, he appeared a respectable, a prudent, and even a great Prince. During the last twenty years of his life, his abilities, by a dextrous management of the events of the times, raised him to an influence in Christendom, scarce ever before carried by a Prince beyond the limits of his own do∣minions. Peculiarly fortunate in the success of his political measures, he obtained his authority through channels the most flattering, because the most uncom¦mon. He was placed at the head of his native coun¦try, as the last hopes of her safety from conquest an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a foreign yoke. He was raised to the throne of Grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Britain, under the name of her deliverer from civ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> tyranny and religious persecution.

his public conduct ought to terminate. Though he was brave in action, and loved war as an amusement, he possessed not the talents of a great general, and he was too prodigal of the lives of men. Though he obtained the name of a deliverer in England, and though, in fact, he might be considered in that light, with regard to Europe, more is owing to his own am∣bition, than to a general love of mankind. In Hol∣land, where he obtained the chief authority, in a time of public distress, he frequently exercised his power in a manner inconsistent with the rights of a free state<NOTE N="Z" PLACE="foot">D'Avaux.</NOTE>. In England, he scarce adhered in any thing, to the moderate declaration which paved his way to the throne. Though he obtained the crown by election, he shewed no disposition to relinquish any of its hereditary ornaments; and though he affected to despise royalty, no Prince was ever more fond of the distinction paid to a King. His intrigues to expel his uncle from a throne, which he himself intended to mount, were by no means suitable with any strict ad∣herence to virtue<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">James II. D'Avaux. MSS. 1688. Dalrymple's Append.</NOTE>. To gain to his interest the ser∣vants of King James, may not have been inconsistent with those allowances generally made for ambitious views.

<P><MILESTONE N="1702" UNIT="year"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Accession of Anne.</NOTE> ANNE, Princess of Denmark, eldest surviving daughter of James the Second, mounted the throne of England, upon the death of King William, in consequence of the act passed in the year 1689, for the settlement of the crown. The two houses of parlia∣ment,
<PB N="213" REF="228"/>
as soon as the death of the late King was made known, assembled; and unanimously congratulated the Queen upon her accession. To the privy council, who met at the same time, she made the customary declaration; and ordered all the Lords and others, who had served the late King in council, to take the oaths to herself in the same capacity. <NOTE PLACE="marg">March 8.</NOTE> She was proclaimed in the afternoon of the eighth of March, with the usual solemnity, amidst the applause of the populace. The two succeeding days were employed in receiving the addresses of the two houses of parliament, the fe∣licitations of the church, and the congratulations of the city of London. The late king, unpopular while he lived, was almost forgot as soon as dead; and the people, with their usual eagerness for novelty, turned all their thoughts toward the first measures of the new reign.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">State of par∣ties.</NOTE> Though the late King had no reason to be pleased with either of the two parties who had divided be∣tween them the nation, he had, some months before his death, thrown himself and his affairs into the hands of the Whigs. The hopes derived by the Tories from the declining state of his health, had prevented that violence, which they might have otherwise ex∣hibited in parliament, on account of their being ex∣cluded from power. The unanimity in the two houses, with regard to foreign affairs, proceeded, probably, from the same cause. The Whigs could deny nothing to the Crown, as their leaders were in office; and the Tories were not averse to a war, which they them∣selves were sure to manage, after the expected demise of the King. The two parties had pledged themselves too far to retreat from their engagements; and, there∣fore, though a change of ministry was naturally to be expected, from the accession of a Princess, whom the coldness of her predecessor, and the disrespectful con∣duct of the party now in power, had evidently thrown into the arms of the Tories, there was no reason to apprehend any change in the great line of the measures of government.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Anne's first speech. March 11.</NOTE> The Queen, in her first speech to parliament, fur∣nished a proof, that she was led by councils very dif∣ferent
<PB N="214" REF="229"/>
from those of her predecessor in the throne. Though she paid a compliment to his memory in the beginning, she concluded with a kind of censure upon his conduct. She assured the two houses, that as her own heart was entirely English, she would agree to every thing that they could either expect or desire for the happiness and prosperity of England. The expres∣sion manifestly regarded the too great attachment to his own countrymen, for which King William had been blamed. But to this allusion to the predilection of the late King for foreigners, she added words that seemed highly to reflect on his moral conduct. In confirmation of her promise to both houses, she assured them, that they would always find HER a strict and religious observer of her word. The first part of the Queen's speech contained the usual assurances of a new reign. She agreed, she said, in sentiments with with the concurrent addresses of the two houses, that too much could not be done for the allies, to reduce the exorbitant power of France. She recommended an union with Scotland, as necessary for the peace and security of both kingdoms; and she desired that the revenue for the support of the civil government, should be renewed in a manner suitable to her own honour and the dignity of the Crown<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">Journals, March 11, 1702.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceedings of the com∣mons.</NOTE> Though the Queen was at no pains to conceal her attachment to one party, the other could not oppose her measures in parliament without deserting their own. The eagerness which she discovered to adhere to the measures of King William, with regard to foreign af∣fairs, would render an opposition to the necessary sup¦plies too inconsistent with the late conduct of the Whigs. They made a merit, therefore, of comply¦ing with what they could not prevent.

between England and Scotland. Provision had been already made, for the eventual expence of a war, during the succeeding summer; and the Queen, in∣stead of demanding supplies from the nation, found an opportunity of alleviating a part of their burden. When she came to the house of lords, on the thirtieth of March, to give the royal assent to the bill for the esta∣blishment of her own revenue, she made a speech from the throne, calculated to gain popularity. She told the two houses, that though the funds for the ci∣vil list, might greatly fall short of what they formerly produced, she would give directions, that one hundred thousand pounds of her own revenue should be applied to the public service of the year<NOTE N="E" PLACE="foot">Journals, March 30.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen engages to support the allies.</NOTE> While Anne was rendering herself popular at home, she gained the esteem of her allies abroad, by shewing a warm zeal for their cause. Two days after the death of William, she condoled with the States of the Uuited Provinces upon that event, in a letter. She assured them, that as she had succeeded the late King in his throne, she would also succeed him in the same inclination, to a constant union and amity with their republic, as well as adherence to the late alliances. That she would concur with the allies in general, in measures necessary for the preservation of the common liberty of Europe, in reducing the power of France within proper bounds. That she should always look upon the interest of England and those of the States as inseparable, and united with such ties as could not be broken, without the greatest prejudice to the two nations. The Earl of Marlborough was probably the adviser of measures, which he afterwards executed with ability. The attachment which this nobleman had uniformly shewn to the Queen, when she was little respected by the nation and persecuted by the court, had either excited sentiments of gratitude or created principles of obedience to his inclinations in her mind. The first honours, and even the first considera∣ble office, conferred in the present reign, were bestowed on the Earl<NOTE N="F" PLACE="foot">March 13.</NOTE>. On the thirteenth of March he re∣ceived

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A ferment without doors.</NOTE> The victory obtained by the Tories over the Whigs, by the succession of a sovereign of their own principles to the throne, produced a ferment without doors, though all things bore a face of harmony and unani∣mity within. Violent men of both parties carried their own prejudices, with indecent freedom, to the press; and disgraced their conversation with mutual reflections of the worst and most dangerous kind. The Whigs were openly accused of aiming at the establish∣ment of a commonwealth, by endeavouring to deprive the reigning Queen of the succession to the throne. The memory of the late King was attacked with open assertions of the same kind; though it is highly pro∣bable, that Prince was very indifferent about what person should mount, after him, the throne. An en¦quiry by the lords into this idle tale, produced only a negative proof of its not being founded in fact. They voted, upon an examination of King William's pa¦pers by a committee, that nothing appeared that tend¦ed to the prejudice of her Majesty, or her succession to the crown. The Lords followed this unmeaning vote, with animadversions upon injurious reflection<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> printed against the Whigs<NOTE N="H" PLACE="foot">May <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/></NOTE>.

The offices of the household were filled with men of high principles for monarchy. The Lords Somers and Halifax, together with other leaders of the Whigs, were excluded from the new privy-council<NOTE N="J" PLACE="foot">April 4.</NOTE>; and their places supplied with eminent Tories. The Marquis of Normanby, remarkable for his attachment to her family, was raised to the office of lord privy-seal, by the Queen. But the most im∣portant promotion of all was that of the Lord Godol∣phin, to the staff of lord high-treasurer of England. Though Godolphin was well qualified for this impor∣tant station, he owed his office more to the influence of the Earl of Marlborough, than to his own merit. The connection, which had long subsisted in political views, between these two noble persons, had been lately more closely cemented, by the marriage of the son of the former with the eldest daughter of the latter. Their private interests being thus united, they carried forward, with harmony as well as abilities, the busi∣ness of the public.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">War declar∣ed.</NOTE> These reasons united the Tories and the Jacobites, in an unanimous support of the government of the new Queen. The Whigs either yielded to the current of the people, always violent for monarchy in every new reign, or they were ashamed of opposing mea∣sures, which sprung first from themselves. On the second of May, the business of the intended war against France and Spain, was debated in the privy-council. The Earl of Rochester, maternal uncle to the Queen, is said to have proposed, that the English nation should only engage in the measures of the allies, as auxiliaries; and that the chief weight of the war ought to rest on those, who had most to fear from the power of France. The Earl of Marlborough, who had re∣turned from Holland, after settling the projected ope∣rations with the States, declared himself vehement for an immediate declaration of war, to be issued by Eng∣land, as a principal. The measures taken by himself, during an embassy of a few days in Holland, rendered, in some degree, necessary the measure which he sup∣ported. The States, upon the assurances made by the Queen, had agreed to all the proposals of her reputed favourite. They had raised him to the chief command of their troops, the allies had furnished, with alacrity, their several quotas, and every thing was actually pre∣pared for a vigorous and active campaign. A majority of the council yielded either to the influence or reasons of the Earl of Marlborough. Their resolutions were communicated, the same day, to the commons; and war was declared in form on the fourth of May.</P>

The joy, therefore, which her elevation had raised among the discontented, soon declined. They appli∣ed, through their leaders, for the dissolution of the convention-parliament. But they were opposed by the ministers, who were afraid to venture upon the new choice of a people already inflamed. The Queen suffered herself to be persuaded by the arguments of the latter, or to be swayed by her own fears. She continued the old parliament, which was appointed to meet on the ninth of June. To add to the discon∣tents of those, who called themselves the country par∣ty, the Duke of Queensberry, highly obnoxious to the people in general, was appointed commissioner. Prior to the meeting of parliament, the Queen endeavoured to allay the bad humour of the malecontents, and to sooth the people into an acquiescence with regard to her own measures. She wrote a letter as early as the twenty-first of April, to the parliament, full of assur∣ances of her protection to the rights of the people, and the interest and independence of the kingdom.

Besides, the regard which Anne may be na∣turally supposed to have entertained for a brother, she had given a thousand assurances to her father, to do every thing in her power to restore the succession to the ancient channel, even before the death of her own son the Duke of Gloucester. The demise of that Prince, her own despair of progeny, her respect for the memory of a father, and some affection for her own family, had probably rendered her inclined to transfer the crown, at her death, to the pretended Prince of Wales. Her chief minister Godolphin, and her greatest favourite the Earl of Marlborough, had added the most solemn oaths to their promises to sup∣port the interest of King James and his son.

The majority of the Scots had, in their disgust at the conduct of the late King, with regard to their commerce, forgot those terrors for their religion, which had induced them to place the crown on his head. The Highlanders, especially, who were never enthusiasts, had always suffered their high notions of hereditary right, to overcome their attachment to Presbytery. The accession of Anne, by bringing the throne nearer to the old stock, had established in their minds a kind of certainty, that things were to return to their former channel.

The Mareschal de Villeroi was, however, taken by the Germans, and the command devolved on the Duke de Vendôme. The young King of Spain took the field, in person. Having left the government in the hands of the Queen, assisted by a council, he had passed into Naples, and took the nominal command of the army, which was actually led by Vendôme. A body of five thousand, under the general Viscomti, were defeated, at Santa Vittoria, on the twenty-sixth of July.

They carried twelve thousand troops on board, nine thousand English, and three Dutch, un∣der the command of the Duke of Ormond. Detained by calms and contrary winds, they arrived not in the neighbourhood of Cadiz, which place they intended to attack, till the twelfth of August. Having landed the troops, the Duke of Ormond took Fort St. Ca∣tharine and Port St. mary; which last place was plun∣dered by the licentious soldiery, contrary to the inten∣tions and commands of their general. After a vain attempt on Fort Matagorda, the troops were reim∣barked, in the middle of September. The confede∣rates steered then their course to Vigo, where the Spanish galleons, under the convoy of thirty French ships of war, commanded by Chateau-Renaud, were just arrived; and having expectedly, and almost unperceived, come to anchor before the place, they resolved to attack it with the utmost vigour.</P>

The King of Poland, in the mean time, having posted himself advantageously at Clissow, with thirty thousand men, chiefly Saxons, Charles marched toward him; and without permitting his troops to rest a moment, though much inferior in number, attacked, routed, and put to flight the enemy. Four thousand Saxons lay dead on the field. A great number of the Poles were also slain. Two thousand, with all the artillery and bag∣gage of King Augustus, fell into the hands of the Swedes.

inconsistent with the conduct of a gentleman, as they were unworthy of his great talents. His political de∣linquency was, at the same time, brought to his ac∣count, by the two great parties which divided the nation. The Tories had not yet forgot his desertion of his benefactor King James the Second; and those who favoured the revolution remembered, to his disadvan∣tage, his conduct toward the late King. The Queen's message was received, at first, with astonishment and silence. A violent debate, at length, arose. Much was said of the merit of Marlborough.

This circum∣stance, however, hindered not the commons from pre∣senting their address. The Tories, who now formed a great majority, contrived to convey a reflection on the late King, in their refusal of a settlement on Marl∣borough. They complained that the revenue of the crown had been already too much reduced, by the exorbitant grants of the last reign, to bear any further alienation. The adherents of the excluded branch of the family of Stuart, seemed to be most inclined to involve Marlborough in the censure passed upon King William. Though he was known to have uniformly opposed the power of that Prince, he was not deemed sincere in his professions and promises to his rival. His zeal, it is certain, had greatly abated, since the acces∣sion of Anne to the throne. He, however, kept upon fair terms with the court of St. Germains. He endea∣voured to ascribe to the multiplicity of his affairs, that want of attention, which actually proceeded from a change of his own views. He had, throughout the preceding summer, expressed frequently a warm at∣tachment to the cause of the pretended Prince of Wales; and, as a proof of his zeal, he granted passes to the agents of that Prince, when they wished to transport themselves into France to inform their master

On the ninth of December, the bill was, a third time, read, passed, and sent to the lords. Though the latter rejected not the bill, they made several amendments, to which the commons would not yield.

The first, by possessing the command of the army, might have effectually served their cause, had his professions been sincere. The latter, though timid in his councils, was a man of abilities, and uni∣formly attached to the excluded branch of the royal family. Marlborough, whose great influence in the measures of the court was known, had made himself a party against the Whigs<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">Hannover-papers, 1703.</NOTE>, by extending, in his own department, his animadversions to those mem∣bers of the house of peers, who had distinguished themselves in opposing what was deemed detrimental to the eventual succession of the family of Hannover<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">The E. of Rivers to Bulau, April 9, 1703.</NOTE>.

To facilitate, therefore, the execution of the scheme, which they earnestly wished her to adopt, they insinuated, that the putting her brother in an immediate possession of the crown of Scotland, would be the most effectual means for securing to him the eventual succession of the crown of England; and that this decisive measure would be attended with little difficulty, considering, that the majority of parliament, in the two kingdoms, were apparently well affected to the hereditary succes∣sion of the throne<NOTE N="H" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>

Sackville, who had, during the late reign, carried on the correspondence between Marlborough and the court of St. Germains, and who had always free ac∣cess to the Duke, proposed a marriage between his third daughter and the pretended Prince of Wales. How Marlborough received the proposal is uncertain. But the negociation seems not to have ended with the present year. The adherents of the family of Han∣nover, either apprised of this projected connexion, or willing to gain to their own party the great influence and weight of Marlborough, formed a scheme on their side, to marry this daughter to the electoral Prince<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot">George II.</NOTE>.

No session of parliament ever met in Scotland, in which more abilities, more eloquence, and per∣haps more violence and animosity, were displayed, than in the present. The whole nation were inte∣rested spectators of a contest, which they were taught to believe, was to determine their independence as a free people, or to subject them for ever to those foreign councils, to which they had, with some reason, ascribed the late misfortunes of the kingdom. The eagerness of the populace was transfused into parlia∣ment. When the commissioner proposed, that the supply should take place of all other business, the op∣position stated the vote, <Q REND="inline">"overture for subsidy, or overtures for liberty."</Q> The commissioner still insist∣ing on his point, the Earl of Roxburgh arose and said, that if there was no other way of supporting the natu∣ral and undeniable privilege of parliament, the friends of their country were resolved to demand justice, with swords in their hands. A general rage transported the house into a degree of fury. The commissioner be∣came apprehensive of the safety of his own person.

The English legislature had settled the succession of the crown on the house of Hannover. King William, either careless of the interests of that family, or, what is more probable, in∣different concerning the fate of the crown, after his own death, had neglected to recommend to a parlia∣ment, whom a long habit had rendered subservient to his views, the settlement of the crown of Scotland, in the protestant line. This circumstance actually left the fate of England in the disposal of the Scotish nation. Should the latter declare for the eventual succession of the Prince of Wales, a title then not il∣legal in Scotland, there can scarce any doubt be form∣ed, but considering the party which still adhered to the exiled family in England, he would have, with great facility, recovered the crown of that kingdom.

In a running battle, which was renewed, at intervals, for several days, the admiral was repeatedly deserted by his captains, his ship disabled, and his own leg shot away. The enemy, though much inferior in number and strength, made, by these means, a safe retreat. Bembow, after this disgraceful, as well as unfortunate action, returned to Jamaica. On the sixth of October, he issued a commission for the trial of captain Kirby and captain Wade. They were found guilty of cowardice, breach of orders, and neglect of duty; and, being sent to England under their sen∣tence, they suffered death, at Plymouth, on the four∣teenth of April, 1704.

But the tempest fell with most fury and did the most harm at sea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Besides the loss sustained by private persons, sixteen ships of the royal navy were cast away. The damage done in London and Westminster alone, was estimated at a mil∣lion sterling. But as the calamity was not universal, the country suffered not in the same proportion. The com∣mons addressed her Majesty upon the occasion. They told her, that they could not see a diminution of her navy, without making provision for repairing the same. They, therefore, desired the Queen to build such capital ships as she should think fit; and they promised, at their next meeting, to make good the expence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">New King of Spain in England.</NOTE> The storm which had done such damage in England<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was felt with the same severity in Holland. The dykes having been broken down in Friezeland, by the violence of the waves, one fourth part of that province was laid under water. A squadron of men of war, under Admi∣ral Calemberg, destined for the expedition with the new King of Spain, to Portugal, was driven from the mouth of the Texel, to the coast of Norway. Of the English ships intended for that service, and lying in the Maese, some were stranded and others lost.

<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> The latter, favouring the church, introduced again into the house of commons, the bill against occasional confor∣mity, which had been lost in the preceding session. This measure had been neither unforeseen nor unexpected by their opponents, and it threw the house into violent de∣bates. The high-church party, however, prevailed. The bill soon passed the commons, and was sent to the lords. The Whigs still maintained in the upper-house a majority. They were, at least, more powerful there, through their superior activity and zeal. The Queen herself, notwithstanding her predilection for the church of England, was cold with regard to a bill, that seemed so highly favourable to the established religion. She had been terrified with reports, that the Jacobites connected their views in favour of her brother, with the success of this bill; and there certainly existed some reason for this apprehension. The ministry, during the dependence of the bill, were left to their own opinions. Marlborough and Godolphin, who were too prudent not to appear at∣tached to the protestant succession, voted for the bill. Other lords in office gave their suffrages on the other side. The bishops themselves were almost equally divided upon the votes; and the bill was at length rejected, by a majority of thirteen voices<NOTE N="X" PLACE="foot">Journals of the lords.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Scotisl plot.</NOTE> The bill against occasional conformity was not the only topic, upon which the Whigs endeavoured, in this ses∣sion, to depress the Tories. During the warm debates on that subject, a circumstance arose, that greatly contri∣buted to the victory which the former party obtained. The Queen acquainted the two houses, on the seven∣teenth of December<NOTE N="Y" PLACE="foot">1703.</NOTE>, that she had received unques∣tionable informations of designs carried on against her go∣vernment in Scotland, by the agents and emissaries of France. The two houses received differently this intelli∣gence. The lords, led by some Whigs of ability and ea∣gerness, grasped at every thing calculated to raise the jea∣lousy of the nation against the Tories. The majority of the commons, being composed of the latter party, consi∣dered the whole as the stale contrivance of a sham-plot: an expedient, they affirmed, often used with success by
<PB N="62" REF="279"/>
their political antagonists. Writers infected with the partialities of the two parties, have given various and op∣posite accounts of an affair, too frivolous to command the attention of the public, had not the minds of mankind been previously inslamed, by the animosities subsisting between two powerful factions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of Simon Fraser.</NOTE> The principal actor in this political piece, and, perhaps, its author, was Captain Simon Fraser, afterwards well known to the world by the title of Lord Lovat. Born with insinuating talents, but rather forward than agreea∣ble in his address, he exerted his whole force upon man∣kind, through the channel of their vanity. His flat∣tery, though too obvious to escape even the observation of the weak, was too strong to be resisted entirely by men of sense. He seemed so eager in bestowing praise, that those who approved the least of his manner, as∣cribed his adulation to his want of judgment, with re∣gard to others, more than to his own designs. Desti∣tute of principle, and despising veracity as useless, he ac∣commodated all his actions to his immediate interest; and all his words to the purpose of deceiving the credulous into his views. Habituated, through time, to this aban∣doned conduct, he became, in a manner, incapable of deviating from it; and thus his profligacy, by being ge∣nerally known, carried its own antidote in itself. In the execution of his own projects, though generally formed with little judgment, he was bold and fearless. He nei∣ther understood those laid by others, nor pursued then<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> either with spirit or with attention. Though unsteady in his disposition, and hourly varying his schemes, he never swerved from the great line of self-interest; and thus, notwithstanding his natural levity and inconstancy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he succeeded by perseverance.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His crimes.</NOTE> Some actions, that brought upon Fraser the highest ani¦madversion of the laws in Scotland, had made him famou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in that kingdom before his intrigues attracted the notice <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the parliament of England.

which he had obtained, through some seditious letters which he wrote, and had fallen into the hands of the earl. Retiring to the Highlands, he lived for some time with his father at Beaufort, a farm which they had ob∣tained, for a subsistence, from the Lord Lovat. That nobleman, dying in the year 1696, left four daughters. Thomas Fraser of Beaufort and his son Simon, collect∣ing some disorderly persons, attempted to seize the estate, as nearest male heirs. Terrified, however, by a prose∣cution at law, they formally renounced their claims. But, in the month of September 1697, Simon Fraser entered, with an armed force, the house of the widow of the Lord Lovat, seized her person, ordered the marriage cere∣mony to be pronounced, in the midst of the sound of a bagpipe, with which he endeavoured to drown the lady's cries, and having stript her naked, by cutting off her stays with his dagger, forced her to bed and consummat∣ed the pretended marriage, amidst the noise and riot of his desperate attendants<NOTE N="Z" PLACE="foot">Trial of Fraser.

He fled to France, and applied to the court of St. Germains for subsistence. But the late King James, offended at his profligacy, and hav∣ing heard of his crimes, would neither receive his advan∣ces, nor admit him into his presence<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Lockhart's Mem. Stuart-papers.</NOTE>. Despairing of success with the abdicated family, he resolved to assume the merit of betraying their councils to the reigning Prince. In consideration of present or promised services, he obtained, through the means of the noted Carstares, one of King William's chaplains, and a kind of favourite, a pardon of his rebellion and other public crimes. The rape upon the widow of the Lord Lovat, not being men∣tioned in the pardon, Fraser was prosecuted for that crime by the lady and her friends. He was forced again to re∣tire to France, in the year 1702; but not, perhaps, with∣out instructions for his conduct in that kingdom, from Mr.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Flies again to France.</NOTE> The Earl of Middleton, who then possessed the most credit at St. Germains, had adopted the bad opinion en∣tertained by the late King James of the character of Fra∣ser.

Having gained the confidence of that prelate, by reconciling himself to the church of Rome, he was introduced by him to the Marquis de Torcy, as a person that promised to be serviceable to the views of the court of France.

But either distrusting his incredible promises, with regard to an insurrection in Scotland, or unwilling to hazard either his men or money, without further security, he made him a present of five hundred Louis d'Ors, and desired him to return to his own country, to bring credentials from those persons over whom he pretended to have so much power. But as the King could not altogether rely upon the cre∣dentials procured by such an unknown adventurer, he first resolved to send along with him a Frenchman.

He directed his course to Scotland, and was met on the borders of that kingdom, by the Duke of Argyle. He was from thence conducted, by that noble∣man, to the Duke of Queensberry, who held, as com∣missioner, a parliament at Edinburgh. The commissi∣oner having deserted the Jacobite faction in the house, to whom he had vowed fidelity, perceived, that by their joining with the country party, they possessed the power as well as the inclination of being revenged. He, there∣fore, grasped with eagerness at the informations, which Fraser, either from vanity or malice, gave against his enemies. He knew, that even to fix a suspicion of a correspondence with France, upon the leaders of opposi∣tion, would not only ruin their credit with govern∣ment, but destroy their influence with the nation. To enable Fraser to execute his instructions with facility and freedom, he granted him a pass to secure him from being seized, in obedience to the letters of fire and sword, which had been issued against him on account of the rape<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">Lockhart's Mem.</NOTE>.</P>

The Duke of Hamilton's principles were already known. But no accusation of consequence could be carried home to him, on the pre∣sent occasion. Fraser, in the mean time, was permitted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> roam through the Highlands, to endeavour to extort <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omises from the chiefs, to rise in arms for the pretended Prince of Wales. His success was not equal either to his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>romises or the expectations of his patron. When the
<PB N="266" REF="283"/>parliament of Scotland was adjourned, on the sixteenth of September, he repaired to London, and his allegations not amounting to a sufficient proof, he was provided with money and a pass, under a borrowed name, by the Duke of Queensberry, who applied for that purpose to the Earl of Nottingham, secretary of state. With the pass, he transported himself safely to Holland, and from thence found means to convey himself again to Paris. His design was to procure such letters to Queensberry's enemies and his own, as might hurt their reputation with the world, if not destroy their persons and ruin their fortunes<NOTE N="F" PLACE="foot">Lockhart's Mem.

Though he connected his detail with those persons of rank of the opposite party with whom he had conversed, it bore ficti∣on so apparently on its face, that Middleton, who always doubted the honesty of Fraser, was convinced of the im∣posture. He amused him, however, with cold but po∣lite letters; while, at the same time, he wrote to the Marquis de Torcy, expressing his doubts concerning his fidelity; and signifying his wishes that he might be se∣cured. Captain James Murray, who had been sent to Scotland to discover the truth of Fraser's interest and con∣nections in that kingdom, returned, in the mean time, to St. Germains. The accounts which he gave of the state of the country, and operations of Fraser, were so diametrically opposite to that presented by the latter to the exiled Queen, that no doubts remained of his trea∣chery. Repeated intelligence from England of the dis∣coveries made by the parliament and privy council, strengthened the proof to such a degree, that Fraser, af∣ter having amused Middleton with a series of letters, con∣cerning his own importance, his influence in Scotland and his loyalty to the excluded family, was thrown, at length, into the Bastille<NOTE N="H" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>

Having, when he returned to London, opened his pro∣jects, in favour of the pretended Prince of Wales, to the famous Ferguson, a more experienced plotter, the latter perceiving his character, suspected his integrity. Under∣standing, at the same time, from Fraser himself, that he was often in conference with the ministry of Scotland; and having seen the pass which he had obtained from the Earl of Nottingham, through the influence of the Duke of Queensberry, he wrote his suspicions to the Duke of Athol, one of the noblemen accused. The Duke, con∣scious that he had never corresponded nor received either message or letter from the court of St. Germains<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1704.</NOTE>, complained openly to the Queen of the conduct of Queensberry and his partizans, in protecting an outlaw, who was hatching the most pernicious designs. Queens∣berry, to vindicate himself, declared, that he had protect∣ed Fraser, in Scotland, upon his promising to make great discoveries; and that he had procured for him a pass, for transporting himself, to procure solid proofs of his own vague assertions. He insinuated, at the same time, that, had not the matter come so soon to light, he doubted not but he should meet with success; and, to strengthen his opinion, he delivered to Queen Anne, as for the Duke of Athol, the letter, intended by the exiled Queen, for the Duke of Gordon.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceedings upon it in parliament.</NOTE> The Scotch plot had arrived at this state, when it fell under the cognizance of the house of lords.

The plot, from this moment, became ob∣viously a topic of animosity and dispute between the Whigs and Tories. But the heats between the parties were not sufficient to keep long depending this matter, especially on an evidence which could carry home no well-grounded charge of treason to any particular person.

</ARGUMENT>
<P><MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg">State of parties.</NOTE> THE differences which had happened between the two houses of parliament, being considered as a quarrel of partie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>, had raised a ferment among their ad∣herents, throughout the kingdom. The Whigs, having prevailed in the house of lords, had carried the highest praises of that assembly to the press, mixed with the grossest invectives on the commons, who favoured the
<PB N="270" REF="289"/>
principles of their political opponents. The contest for the possession of power, which had ever been the princi∣ple motive for the violences on both sides, was managed, as usual, upon topics calculated to engage the minds of the people. The Whigs averred, that religion was in danger, from a fixed design of the Tories to defeat the protestant succession. The Tories, on their part, af∣firmed, that the Whigs extended their views to the sub∣version of monarchy itself, and the ruin of the church of England. A credulous multitude were thus tossed be∣tween the vicissitudes of hopes and fears, in proportion as either party found means to accommodate their own allegations to the principles or prejudices of the vulgar.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earl of Nottingham</NOTE> Some changes made in the ministry after the proroga∣tion of parliament, rendered the high-church party dis∣satisfied, without gaining the confidence of the Whigs. The Earl of Nottingham, a man of vehement principles, with regard to the high prerogatives of the crown and an implicit faith in the church, was removed from the office of secretary of state. Nottingham had owed his strict adherence to his party, an importance to which he was not entitled by his abilities. Though not destitute of ta∣lents for business, his extreme loquacity<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">MS. Notes, by Dean Swist.</NOTE> raised sus∣picions concerning the solidity of his understanding; and he was so much wedded to his political opinions, that he could hardly live in common charity with men of mode∣rate principles, either in church or state<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">Macky's character</NOTE>. His at∣tachment to the church had rendered him averse to the measures of King James, while that Prince sat on the throne. But his zeal for the indefeasible rights of mo∣narchy induced him, afterwards, to favour the views of his family. He opposed the abjuration of the Prince of Wales with such vehemence, that he is said to have shed tears when the bill passed. But he was too prudent, of perhaps, too timid, to risque, like many others possessed of the same principles, any direct correspondence with the excluded family<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and several Tories dis∣misted.</NOTE> The resignation of Nottingham was attended by the removal of other adherents of the high-church, from some departments of importance. The Earl of Jersey, a man
<PB N="271" REF="290"/>
who, with a very ordinary understanding, had passed through several of the greatest offices in the kingdom, was deprived of the staff of lord chamberlain; which the Earl of Kent was said to have purchased with money, from the in∣fluence of the Duchess of Marlborough with the Queen<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">Publications of the times.</NOTE>. Sir Edward Seymour, who through the course of a long life had, in a manner, avowed his attachment to the excluded family, but had complied with the times, was dismissed from the office of comptroller of the Queen's household. Blaithwaite, who had enjoyed, for many years, the place of secretary at war, was removed, more perhaps from the conveniency of having his office to bestow upon ano∣ther, than for any exceptions against either his own prin∣ciples or conduct. Men who judged superficially of things, looked upon these changes as the consequences of an alteration of system in the cabinet; and ascribed to their own mistaken opinion concerning the principles of the lord-treasurer, what had actually proceeded from his prudence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Harley and others ad∣vanced.</NOTE> Notwithstanding the chearfulness with which the com∣mons granted the supplies for the war, and their firm ad∣herence to Tory principles, the lord-treasurer and the Duke of Marlborough perceived, from the complexion of the house of lords in the last session of parliament, that a powerful opposition to government was to be apprehend∣ed from the Whigs. They persuaded, therefore, the Queen, that it was necessary either to sway or break the party, by bringing into office some of its reputed mem∣bers<NOTE N="E" PLACE="foot">Hannover-papers. 1704.</NOTE>. Harley, then speaker of the house of commons, though he had uniformly opposed the measures of King William, was deemed, in principles, a Whig, from his being bred a dissenter. He, however, was supposed too prudent to sacrifice his own interest to the views of par∣ty; and as his talents for managing business in the house of commons were known and acknowledged, he became a great object of acquisition to the Lord Godolphin. Harley, therefore, was first sworn in at the council∣board; and soon after appointed secretary of state, in the room of the Earl of Nottingham. The office of comp∣troller-general was bestowed on Mr. Mansel, his friend;
<PB N="272" REF="291"/>
and his recommendation placed<NOTE N="F" PLACE="foot">Hannover-papers.</NOTE>, at the same time, Mr. St. John, afterwards Lord Viscount Bolingbroke, in the place of secretary at war, vacant by the removal of Mr. Blaithwaite.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Campaign of 1704.</NOTE> This expedient, however, would have been found in∣sufficient against the intended opposition of the Whigs<NOTE N="G" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>, had not the singular success of the campaign imposed silence upon those who had prepared themselves for blam∣ing the treasurer and for accusing the Duke of Marlbo∣rough. The latter having, in the beginning of the year, visited Holland, and concerted the operations of the campaign with the States, had returned to England before the prorogation of parliament. To carry into execution the plan which he had formed and weighed, he embarked at Harwich, on the nineteenth of April. The success of the two last campaigns, having rendered the allies masters of the Maese and Spanish Guelderland, such a strong barrier had been formed on the side of Flanders, that a small number of forces were deemed sufficient to protect the frontiers of the States, against the efforts of the enemy. Marlborough having found means to convince the Dutch of their security, in that quarter, proposed to march into the heart of Germany, to pro∣tect the Emperor, now almost threatened with the siege of his capital, by the joint force of the French and Bavarians.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Marlbo∣rough marches</NOTE> The threatened march of the Elector, at the head of the combined army, into the hereditary dominions of the house of Austria, was not, however, the only thing that alarmed the Emperor and continued his fears. The in∣surgents in Hungary, encouraged by France, had pos∣sessed themselves of several important places, and offered their aid to the enemy. Leopold, unable to repress their insolence, was forced to shut his eyes on their re∣bellion<NOTE N="H" PLACE="foot">Hist. de l'Em∣pire d'Allemagne, tom. vii.</NOTE>. He applied, as his last resort, to the Queen of England, through Count Wratislaw, his envoy-extra∣ordinary at the court of London. This minister pre∣sented, on the second of April, a memorial to Queen Anne, containing an affecting state of the distressed con∣dition of his master's affairs. The resolution for reliev∣ing
<PB N="273" REF="292"/>
the Emperor, by carrying the war into Bavaria, which had been previously taken, was hastened by this requisition. The Duke of Marlborough, having settled affairs with the States, left the Hague on the fifth of May, under the pretence of a design to carry the war to the banks of the Moselle, and, by that river, to pene∣trate into France, while every thing had been prepared for the real expedition to Bavaria and the Danube.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">into Ger∣many.</NOTE> Having passed through Utrecht to Ruremond, and from the latter place to Maestricht, Marlborough, as he advanc∣ed, ordered the British and other troops to join and march towards Coblentz, at the confluence of the Rhine and Moselle. D'Auverquerque, destined to command the army left for the defence of the Dutch frontiers, met the Duke at Maestricht; and his Grace advancing through Juliers, arrived in the camp near Coblentz, on the twen∣ty-fifth of May. C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ossing the Rhine at that place, and successively the Maine and the Neckar, he was met at Mondelsheim by Prince Eugene of Savoy. To join the army under the duke to the Imperial troops, led by the Prince of Baden, was the result of a consultation between these distinguished commanders. Prince Eugene having hastened to Philipsburg, to take upon himself the com∣mand of the army on the Upper-Rhine, the duke ad∣vanced toward the Danube, and joined the Imperialists, at Westerstetten; and having arrived on the river Brentz, on the twenty-eighth of June, he placed his camp with∣in two leagues of the Elector of Bavaria's army. The troops of the allies consisted of ninety-six battalions of foot, and two hundred and two squadrons of horse and dragoons, provided with forty-four pieces of field can∣non, four howitzers, and twenty-four pontons. The force of the enemy was inferior in point of numbers, con∣sisting only of eighty-eight battalions of foot, and one hundred and sixty squadrons of horse. But they had nine∣ty pieces of cannon, forty mortars and howitzers, and thirty pontons<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot">Returns of the armies.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Attack at Donawert.</NOTE> The generals of the allies having, in a council of war, resolved to attack Donawert, on the Danube, forced the enemies intrenchments, before the place, with the loss
<PB N="274" REF="293"/>
of five thousand men, on each side. This action happen∣ed on the second of July; and, the next day, Donawert was deserted by the Bavarians; and thus, the allies ob∣tained by their victory a bridge over the river, while they separated from one another the troops of the enemy stationed on the Upper and Lower Danube. The posi∣tion gained by the allies was not, however, sufficient to enable them to penetrate into Bavaria<NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">Hist. de France, tom. iii.</NOTE>, without re∣moving themselves too far from Nuremberg and Nortlin∣gen, from whence they drew their supplies. To avoid a battle, with regard to the Elector of Bavaria and the French, was ultimately to force the allies to retire back to the Maine. But the Elector having been reinforced with a fresh army under the command of the Mareschal de Tallard, resolved, after a short negociation into which he had entered to amuse the allies, to abandon his own fate and that of his country, to the event of a battle. The opposing armies, after the junction of Tallard with the Bavarians, were equal in number, consisting each of eighty thousand combatants<NOTE N="L" PLACE="foot">Mem. du Marq. Feuquiere, p. 251.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Situation of the armies.</NOTE> Though the allies had passed, without resistance, the Danube, they were incapable, for want of magazines, either to continue long on the banks of that river or to penetrate into Bavaria. They wished, therefore, with the utmost eagerness, to give battle; and they watched for that purpose every motion of the enemy that might furnish them with the advantage which they so much de∣sired. The evil destiny of France, the ignorance and haughtiness of her generals, the Mareschals Tallard and Marsin, together with the vehemence of the Elector himself, offered, at length, the opportunity which the enemy sought after in vain. Prince Eugene, having marched with twenty thousand men, from the Rhine, to observe Tallard on his march through the Black forest, had now joined the Duke of Marlborough. Having pre¦vailed with the Prince of Baden to besiege Ingoldstad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> they rid themselves of the councils of that general, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> resolved to give immediate battle to the enemy, whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the latter, relying upon the strength of their positio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> shewed no inclination to decline.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="294"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Blenheim, August 13.</NOTE> The French and Bavarians lay encamped with the Danube on their right. The village of Blenheim, on the bank of that river, stood a little advanced in the front of the right wing of their line. Their left was covered with an extensive thick wood, from which ran a rivulet along their front, into the Danube. This rivu∣let, as it passed through the plain, formed an almost continued morass, which would have been very difficult to pass, had not the French and Bavarians, by a negli∣gence fatal to themselves, formed their line at a conside∣rable distance behind. When the Elector and the mares∣chals perceived that the enemy, who were encamped with their left to the Danube and their right extending to the wood, were resolved to give them battle, they threw twenty-eight battalions and eight squadrons of dra∣goons, into the village of Blenheim. Eight battalions were, at the same time, placed in another village, to∣ward the center, with a design, in conjunction with those at Blenheim, to fall upon the rear of the enemy when they should pass the brook; and so place them be∣tween two fires. Such was the situation of the French on the morning of the thirteenth of August. Their wretched disposition insured the loss of the battle. Their line, consisting chiefly of cavalry, formed at the head of their camp, was weakened by these large detachments, whilst the enemy were permitted to pass the morass, formed by the rivulet, without any resistance<NOTE N="M" PLACE="foot">Mem. du Marq. de Feuquiere. Kane's campaigns.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The French and Bavari∣ans routed.</NOTE> The Duke of Marlborough, who commanded the left of the allies, having formed his line, after passing the brook, ordered the two villages to be attacked by the infantry, while he himself led his cavalry against those of Tallard. After several charges, with various success, the courage of the French horse began, at length, to abate. They retired behind the fire of ten bartalions, that had advanced while the cavalry were engaged. These sustained the charge, for a considerable time, against the English foot. But the duke, in the mean time, having charged home with his horse the French cavalry, already wavering, drove them in their flight, into the Danube, and most of those who had escaped the sword, were drowned in that river. The ten batta∣lions
<PB REF="295"/>
of the enemy's foot were, at the same time, charg∣ed on all sides and cut to pieces. Prince Eugene, who commanded on the right, had attacked the Elector of Bavaria and the Mareschal de Marsin. The Prince, however, could make no impression on their line. But when they perceived that Tallard was defeated, they threw themselves into three columns, and quitted the field with great dexterity and expedition. Had they now fallen on the flank of Marlborough, whose troops were employed in pillaging the camp of Tallard, the victory might have been recovered; or, at least, the troops sta∣tioned in the two villages, might have been saved. Those at Aberclaw found means to escape, in the confusion. But the twenty-eight battalions of foot and twelve squa∣drons of horse, in Bleinheim, surrendered at discretion, to the allies.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Conse∣quences of the battle</NOTE> The battle of Blenheim, which seemed to decide the fate of Germany, turned the whole scale of the war against the house of Bourbon. The loss of the French and Bavarians in killed, drowned, wounded, deserters, and prisoners, amounted to near one half of their army. The Mareschal de Tallard himself was among the pri∣soners. The camp, equipage, baggage, and artillery of the enemy, fell into the hands of the conquerors, to∣gether with every other trophy attending on a complete victory. The battle, however, was not unbloody on the side of the allies. Fourteen thousand men were ei∣ther killed or wounded, and among the slain several officers of high merit and rank. The troops, under Prince Eugene, meeting with the greatest resistance, suffered the most. The Elector and the Mareschal de Marsin, though they scarce could be said to have been routed, retired, with every mark of a defeat, under the cover of night, to Ulm. They remained in that cite only one day; and, having directed their rout through the Black forest, joined the Mareschal de Villeroi, on the Rhine.</P>

excesses which had been committed by the enemy on his own. An extent of seventy leagues of country, which had fallen into the hands of the victors, felt all the mi∣series and ravages attending upon conquest. The French, ruined, broken, and dispersed, left a free and uninter∣rupted march to the confederates, from the Danube to the Rhine. The remains of an army that, at the be∣ginning of the year, extended terror to the gates of Vi∣enna, were now forced to take shelter within the limits of France. The victors crossed the Rhine. They en∣tered Alsace, and the important fortresses of Landau and Trearbach fell into their hands, before the end of the campaign<NOTE N="N" PLACE="foot">Hist. de France, tom. iii. Siecle de Louis xiv.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Campaign in Flanders and Portu∣gal.</NOTE> The campaign in Flanders being merely defensive, on both sides, produced no event, either brilliant or impor∣tant. Auverquerque, who commanded the allies, on the frontiers of the States, bombarded Namur, without effect, in the month of July. The same good fortune which had attended the arms of the confederates on the Danube, was not general on every side of the war. The Archduke Charles, who had taken the title of King of Spain, had landed at Lisbon, on the ninth of March, with eight thousand English and Dutch forces. Philip the Fifth, strengthened with an army of twenty thousand French, carried the war into Portugal, early in the spring. Several places, and particularly Portalegre, fell into his hands; and in various slight rencounters in the field, he defeated the Portugueze. Disputes between the King of Portugal and the Duke of Schomberg, who commanded the English and Dutch auxiliaries, forced the Queen to recall that nobleman; who was succeeded by the Earl of Galloway, through the intrigues of Mr. Methuen, the English ambassador at the court of Lisbon. The King of Portugal and the Archduke, having in vain attempted to cross the river Angueda, and invade Cas∣tille, were forced to retreat from the presence of the Duke of Berwick, into the heart of Portugal, where they distributed their troops in winter quarters<NOTE N="O" PLACE="foot">Hist. de Portugal, tom. ii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Campaign in Italy.</NOTE> On the side of Italy, the Duke of Modena having espoused the cause of the Emperor, was deprived of his

The Duke of Mirandola, who joined him∣self to the interests of France, experienced the like mis∣fortune from the arms of the Imperialists. The Duke of Mantua, perceiving that his dominions were become the theatre of war, endeavoured, by marriage, to gain the favour of France. The campaign in Italy proved, upon the whole, favourable for the house of Bourbon. The castle of<NOTE N="P" PLACE="foot">June 12.</NOTE> Suza and the city of Pignerol were taken in June. Vercelli surrendered in July<NOTE N="Q" PLACE="foot">July 20.</NOTE>. The city, the citadel, and the castle of Yvrea fell into the hands of Vendôme, in the month of September. No action of any note happened in the field. The Empe∣ror having employed his chief force in the defence of his hereditary dominions in Germany, found himself in no capacity to reinforce his troops in the duchy of Mantua. The French, therefore, took place after place, with little resistance; and closed the campaign by the taking of Sensano, on the twenty-fifth of November.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>braltar taken.</NOTE> The taking of Gibraltar by the English, and an unde∣cisive battle between the French and the confederates near Malaga, rendered distinguished the naval operations of the present year. The combined fleet that had car∣ried the Archduke to Lisbon, having quitted that port, presented themselves before Barcelona; where a party had entered into a secret agreement with the allies to place that city in their hands. The plot was discovered and disappointed by the viceroy of the province; but he durst neither seize nor punish the conspirators. The fleet quitting the coast of Catalonia, appeared before Cadiz, which city had been placed in a posture of defence by the vigilance of the governor.

Part of the army employed in Portugal being withdrawn from that kingdom, for the purpose of retaking Gibraltar, stopt the progress of Philip the Fifth. The French fleet, to the number of fifty-two ships, com∣ing to the aid of the besiegers, under the conduct of the Comte de Toulouse, was met, on the twenty-fourth of August, about twelve leagues from Malaga, by Sir George Rooke and the Dutch admiral Calemberg, with an equal force. An obstinate battle ensued, to which the night put, at length, an end. Both sides claimed the victory, and both deserved it, had success depended on valour. Though no ships were sunk or lost, the fleets were so much disabled, that neither shewed any inclina∣tion to renew the fight the succeeding day. Willing to get clear of each other, they gradually made their retreat. The French, unable to give aid to the Spaniards before Gibraltar, made the most use of the wind to carry them to their ports; while the fleet of the allies, having left a squadron on the coast of Spain, directed their course to England<NOTE N="S" PLACE="foot">Naval Hist.</NOTE>.</P>

The cardinal-primate, long in the interest of the King of Sweden, assembled a diet at Warsaw; and the throne was declared vacant, on the fourteenth of February. King Augustus, having issued manifestos in vain, resolved to support himself with the sword. He assembled his adherents in Poland. He call∣ed his allies the Russians to his aid. The King of Swe∣den, in the mean time, pressed the Poles to elect a new Sovereign. Stanislaus Leczinski, Palatine of Posnania, was accordingly raised to the throne, on the twelfth of July. The war was continued with vigour. The Sax∣ons were defeated, on the sixth of August. They were again routed, on the nineteenth. But, notwithstanding these misfortunes, King Augustus found means to sur∣prise Warsaw, on the fifth of September; and either to disperse or seize the adherents of his rival. He, however, was driven again from that capital, in the end of Octo∣ber; and forced to take refuge in his hereditary domini∣ons; which he almost ruined, by immense preparations for renewing, with vigour, the war for the recovery of the kingdom he had lost<NOTE N="X" PLACE="foot">Hist. de Pologne, tm. ii.</NOTE>.</P>

The party excluded from office had, in a manner, openly declared, that they would attack him in parliament; and, it must be confessed, that notwithstand∣ing his great actions, he was not free from faults which his enemies might have seized with advantage. The torrent of his glory, however, came with such rapidity and strength on their designs, that they were levelled, and in a moment ruined.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Secret in∣trigues of Marlbo∣rough.</NOTE> The Whigs despairing of any success from an opposi∣tion to Marlborough, seem, at this time, to have formed designs of inducing him to embark in their own cause. They had long observed, that neither the Duke nor the lord-treasurer had ever yet, even in appearance, renounced the pretensions of the Prince of Wales. Their object, therefore, was to gain the Duke to the Protestant succes∣sion, by a marriage between his daughter and the elec∣toral Prince. But this, with other schemes of the like kind, were dropt as difficult and uncertain<NOTE N="Z" PLACE="foot">Sir Rowland Gwynne's letters.</NOTE>.

The Duke, though, perhaps, not so sincere in his professions as the treasurer, was less guarded in his conduct. In the month of April, when he was preparing to break the power of the French in Germany, he regretted the absence of his nephew, the Duke of Berwick, in Portugal; as he ought to be nearer Britain, to take advantage of such events as might arise in favour of the exiled Prince. He gave, at the same time, the most solemn assurances of his unalterable fide∣lity and attachment to the excluded family; and directed their agents to apply to the Lord Godolphin, upon any emergency that might arise during his own absence in the campaign<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, April 22, 1704.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of Scotland.</NOTE> During the important operations of the campaign abroad, some transactions in Scotland engaged a part of

the attention of the nation at home. The country-party, inflamed at what they deemed an indignity, the inter∣ference of the English house of lords, with a plot suppos∣ed to have existed in Scotland, joined themselves more closely with that party whose almost avowed intentions were to serve the interests of the excluded family. The Queen, in compliance with her promise to the house of peers, made no secret of her design to propose to the parliament of Scotland, the settlement of the crown of that kingdom on the house of Hannover. To pave the way for this important business, some changes were made in the administration. The Duke of Queensberry, who had rendered himself obnoxious, by his patronage of Frarer and the plot, was dismissed, to soften the popu∣lar party, from his place of secretary of state; and the Marqurs of Tweedale, a man of more honesty than abi∣lities, succeeded him in the office of lord-high-commis∣sioner to the parliament.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Intrigues of parties.</NOTE> Prior to the meeting of that assembly, the different factions used every art to strengthen themselves by gain∣ing their opponents. The Duke of Hamilton, considered as the head of the Jacobites, associated himself with the country-party, and sent a deputation of their number to London, to oppose the designs and influence of his mortal enemy the Duke of Queensberry. The persons chosen for this kind of embassy were the Earls of Rothes and Roxburgh, together with Baillie of Jerviswood, men less attached to the principles of their party, than to their own private interest. Having arrived at London, and joined their efforts with the Duke of Athol, the accom∣plished the dismission of Queensberry. But, contrary to the intention of their confederates the Jacobites, they promised, in return, to the English ministry, to support in parliament the succession of the house of Hannover. The Duke of Hamilton, and his party, though not ig∣norant of the designs of their agents, resolved to pursue with undeviating perseverance, their own. They affect∣ed to appear ignorant of the agreement made between the members of the deputation and the court of England; while, at the same time, they gained the adherents o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Duke of Queensberry to a resolution of opposing th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceedings of Parlia∣ment.</NOTE> In this state of affairs the parliament met at Edinburgh, on the sixth of July. The Queen recommended, in her letter, unanimity of councils, and the settlement of the succession in the Protestant line; and demanded an immediate supply for maintaining the civil and mili∣tary establishments of the kingdom. The commissioner, the chancellor, and the Earl of Cromarty, now sole se∣cretary of state, supported, as usual, the demands of the Queen in a succession of formal speeches. Their elo∣quence produced so little effect on the house, that they scarce had finished when a motion was made, <Q REND="inline">"That the house, without naming a successor, should stand by and defend her Majesty's person and government.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Act of secu∣rity receives the royal assent.</NOTE> The eagerness with which these motions were received, convinced the court-party, that the project for settling the succession was ill timed, To allay the ferment which had prevailed in the nation ever since the Queen refused her assent to the act of security, her English ministers had advised her to gratify the Scots upon that subject. Be∣sides, the opposition had resolved, that till the act of se∣curity should receive the royal assent, no supply should be granted. An act, in substance the same with that which had passed the house the preceding year, was read,
<PB N="284" REF="303"/>
for the first time, on the twenty-fifth of July; and, on the fifth of August, it was touched with the scepter. Though the Duke of Hamilton was in close correspond∣ence with the court of St. Germains, some of the adhe∣rents of the excluded family had formed a suspicion of his having views of his own on the crown. The act of security, they said, chiefly carried by his zeal and indus∣try, contained a clause which pointed out the Duke him∣self for the throne of Scotland. A provision was made, that the successor should be a Protestant, and of the royal line of Scotland; but that the person appointed should not be, at the same time, successor to the crown of Eng∣land. Next the family of Hannover, who were, in a manner, excluded by the clause, the Duke of Hamilton himself was the nearest Protestant of the royal line; be∣ing lineally descended, by a daughter, from the first branch of the house of Stuart, who reigned in Scot∣land.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Parliament prorogued.</NOTE> Though the adherents of the excluded family had gain∣ed to their own cause the votes of the adherents of the Duke of Queensberry, with a promise, that the plot which had made so much noise in England in the preced∣ing year, should not be discussed in parliament, it was brought into debate by the Lord Belhaven<NOTE N="F" PLACE="foot">August 9.</NOTE>. In a di∣gression from the subject of his speech, his Lordship gave a full account of the proceedings in the English house of peers concerning that supposed conspiracy. This circum∣stance induced Mr. Fletcher of Salton to present a resolve to the house, which he desired might be read and voted. The purport of this overture was, that the English house of lords, by their examination of the plot, and by address∣ing the Queen, in relation to a successor to the crown of Scotland, had unduely interfered with the concerns of Scotlmen, and had encroached upon the honour, sove∣reignty and independency of the nation. This motion was opposed with great warmth by the court party, and even by many who had hitherto been considered as mem∣bers of the country party. The thing itself was, how∣ever, too popular not to pass. The carrying of this reso∣lution, and another for addressing the Queen, for laying before the house the evidence and papers relating to

the plot, finished the business of the session, which was closed by a prorogation, on the twenty-seventh of Au∣gust<NOTE N="G" PLACE="foot">Proceedings of the Scot. parl.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections.</NOTE> The refractory disposition of the parliament of Scot∣land alarmed the favourers of the protestant succession in England. Though the minister, the Lord Godolphin, was by no means of that number, the natural timidity of his disposition rendered him, in some measure, averse from a conduct which he secretly approved. He per∣ceived, that things could not long remain in their present unsettled condition; and to prevent a crisis of affairs, which he had not courage to encounter, he deserted his principles. There is no reason to believe that he private∣ly encouraged the malecontents in Scotland, to reject the proposal for settling the crown in the house of Hannover. But he had not yet opened that scene of corruption, which, afterwards, quieted the turbulence of the Scots; and which was, perhaps, necessary for the peace and safety of the two kingdoms. The Duke of Hamilton, who knew the principles of Godolphin, expressed his own fears of his want of courage<NOTE N="H" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1704.</NOTE>. He supposed, before the parliament of Scotland met, that many of the mem∣bers were to be gained with money, by the lord-treasurer of England; and to meet him, in the line of corruption, he demanded a large sum<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot">25,000l.</NOTE> from France, for the pur∣pose of purchasing votes<NOTE N="J" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1704.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Secret nego∣ciations and</NOTE> Though the Duke of Hamilton was unjustly accused in Fraser's plot, as being privy to a descent from France in the preceding summer, he had, in the present year, seriously advised that measure, should matters come to a rupture between the parliament of Scotland and the Eng∣lish ministry. He sent a message to the court of St. Ger∣mains, recommending that a force should be held ready on the coast for an emergency. He assured the exiled family, that their party in Scotland, in conjunction with those who adhered to the independence of their country, were resolved, rather than submit to the succession of the house of Hannover, to throw every thing into confusion, and leave the decision of the contest to the sword. He gave it, as his opinion, that five thousand men would be
<PB N="286" REF="305"/>
sufficient to re-establish the excluded line on the throne of Scotland; and eventually to raise them to the sove∣reignty of England. But before any descent should be attempted, he desired to be informed concerning the views and promises of the adherents of the excluded Prince in the latter kingdom; as the force necessary for a successful invasion, ought to be greater or smaller in proportion to the quality and number of his English friends. The Marquis of Montrose, the Earls of Errol, Marshal, Breadalbin, and Panmure, the Viscount Stor∣mont, the Lord Balmarino, the deprived bishops, and many of the chiefs of the highland clans, expressed the same inclinations, and adhered to the same sentiments, with the Duke of Hamilton<NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">Stuart papers, 1704.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">intrigues of the exiled family.</NOTE> The victory obtained in parliament over the propo∣sals of the English ministry, and the condescension of the Queen, in giving the royal assent to the act of secu∣rity, prevented that rupture for which Hamilton signi∣fied his inclination to be prepared. The ministers of the excluded Prince were, however, either incapable or un∣willing to obtain, from the court of France, an arma∣ment for the invasion of Scotland; and they made, there∣fore, their application for a descent in England. On the twenty-second of June, a memorial for that purpose was presented to the Marquisses de Torcy and de Chamillart. They signified to those ministers, that an attempt on England would be less impracticable and more decisive, than to carry the war into Scotland, though the majority in that kingdom were in the interest of the exiled family. They averred, with reason, that the possession of Eng∣land would insure the submission of Ireland and Scotland; and that the former was now destitute of troops, or only left under the protection of a few guards, and some new levies, dispersed over the face of the country. They re¦presented, that the month of March was the most pro¦per time for a descent, before the supplies were levied, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the fleet armed.

She insinu∣ated, that nothing was more obvious, than that a timely improvement of the present advantages, would enable them to procure a lasting foundation of security for Eng∣land, and a firm support for the liberty of Europe. To accomplish these desireable ends, she demanded a supply from the commons. She told them, that she believed they would find some charges necessary, in the succeed∣ing year, which were not mentioned in the last; and that some extraordinary expences had been incurred, for which no provision had been made.

They were as expeditious in finding the ways and means, as they were liberal in furnishing the supplies. The whole business was carried forward with such harmony, cheerfulness, and facility, that on the ninth of December, all the money-bills received the royal assent.

itself to the commons. But the spirit of dissension was rather suspended than extinguished.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">State of parties.</NOTE> The lord-treasurerer, though a Tory himself and even a Jacobite, had permitted a caution, which his enemies called timidity, to supersede his principles, in the arrange∣ment made in the departments of government, at the close of the last session of parliament. To trim between the two great parties, who divided between them the na∣tion, he had placed moderate Whigs in places possessed by violent Tories. He had the misfortune to lose the latter, and not to gain the former. The possession of power, under the specious name of a difference in opi∣nion, had long been the motive of contest between these factions; and their mutual animosities had ascended to a height that disdained a divided authority in the kingdom. The trimming Whigs, admitted by Godolphin into office, had promised to manage both parties, by playing their prejudices against one another. This conduct, to make it succeed, required the utmost dexterity and address. Though the parties were so poized, that the weight of government could give to either side, at pleasure, the vic∣tory, their contests, especially, in their present inflamed state, were certain of embarrassing, if not capable of en∣tirely obstructing the public business.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bill against occasional conformity.</NOTE> Deserted friends became frequently, through pride, the fiercest enemies. The Tories, though as much of∣fended with Marlborough as with Godolphin, resolved to attack only the latter, as the high reputation obtained by the former had rendered him an object too great to be assailed. The bill against occasional conformity, which had been twice lost before, in the house of lords, was again introduced by the church party, into the house of commons<NOTE N="T" PLACE="foot">Nov. 23.</NOTE>. To embarrass the ministry, and to distress the Whigs, who abetted the dissenters, a motion was made for tacking the bill to the land-tax bill. The house of lords having no power to alter any money-bill, but either to pass it entire or reject the whole, that assembly would either have been obliged to agree to the bill, or to put an end to the war, which depended on the sup∣plies. The ministry, especially secretary Harley, him∣self a dissenter, procured, by his own address and the weight of government, a majority in the lower house,
<PB N="289" REF="308"/>
against the motion<NOTE N="U" PLACE="foot">Nov. 28.</NOTE>. The bill, however, was passed by the commons, without being tacked. But, again it was thrown out by the lords. This new disappointment increased the animosity of the Tories against the Lord Godolphin; as they ascribed their defeat, in a favourite project, to the weight which he had thrown into the hands of the opposite party.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Conduct of parties.</NOTE> The two parties, during the remainder of this session of parliament, seemed to have made an exchange of principles, could a judgment of their private views be formed from their public conduct. When the act of se∣curity, which had been passed in Scotland in the preceding summer, came to be debated in the parliament of Eng∣land, the Whigs and Tories complained against it with equal warmth. The first endeavoured to derive advan∣tage from a circumstance so favourable to their avowed principles. The latter pretended, from the like motives, to guard against its consequences. The Tories, in their arguments in the house of commons, urged that the pas∣sing the act of security tended to defeat the succession in the house of Hannover. But when this proposition was reduced into a motion, it was rejected by the Whigs, though they had professed themselves the only friends of the descent of the crown in the protestant line. The two parties, however, agreed that some vigorous efforts must be taken in England, to obviate the dangers arising from the proceedings in Scotland. The violent, on both sides, were, however, well-pleased at bottom with measures which seemed equally calculated to promote their respec∣tive views. The republican part of the Whigs looked upon the act of security as highly favourable to their own principles; and the warm Jacobites among the Tories considered the exclusion of the house of Hannover, as a great step towards the restoration of the excluded branch of the family of Stuart.</P>

An act for appointing commissioners for treating with the Scots, concerning an entire union, was read a third time, on the twentieth of December, and sent down to the commons for their concurrence. The lords, a few days before, had addressed her Majesty, to put the town of Newcastle in a state of defence, to secure the port of Tin∣mouth, and to repair Carlisle and Hull.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His intri∣gues with the court of St. Ger∣mains.</NOTE> While the Duke of Marlborough was thus publicly gratified by the two parties, and favoured by the Whigs, he continued to make secret professions and protestations of zeal for the interests of the excluded family. A few days after his arrival from Holland, he invited himself to supper with the Duchess of Tyrconnel, who happened to be then in London. Her attachment to the court of St. Germains, and her knowledge of the duke's connex∣ions with the servants of the Prince of Wales, encourag∣ed her to remind him of his former promises, and to sug∣gest her expectations from his future services. He an∣swered her in general terms. But when she urged him to agree on particulars, he solemnly assured her, that with∣out descending to circumstances, or fixing the time, he would do every thing which honour and justice demand∣ed at his hands<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, Jan. 4, 1705.</NOTE>. The Lord Godolphin himself, though proscribed by the Tories, as affecting the princi∣ples and views of the Whigs, notwithstanding his natural caution, had, it seems, at the same time, given a proof of the continuance of his zeal for the excluded family, by insinuating to their agents, that he would search for an opportunity to pay a part, at least, of the arrears of the jointure due to the exiled Queen<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Case of the men of Aylesbury.</NOTE> An object of division presented itself to the commons in a matter in which their own privileges, as they main∣tained, were very essentially concerned. Five inhabitants of the borough of Aylesbury brought their actions against William White, the mayor of that corporation, for hav∣ing refused to receive their votes, in the election of mem∣bers to serve in parliament. The commons ordered these men to be committed to Newgate, for a breach of pri∣vilege. But the prisoners brought their <HI>habeas corpus</HI> in∣to the court of Queen's Bench; and provided themselves with council, who pleaded, upon various grounds, that they ought to be discharged. The lord chief-justice Holt, who presided on the bench, was of the same opini∣on, declaring that neither house of parliament, nor both jointly, without the concurrence of the sovereign, have any power or right to dispose of the liberty or the proper∣ty of the subject. He affirmed, admitting that the com∣mons possessed a right of punishing persons with impri∣sonment for a breach of privilege, that commencing of a suit was no breach of that kind; that a just cause of acti∣on, grounded on the common law, could not be construed into a contempt, without subjecting the rights of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eople and the common course of justice between man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd man, to the caprice of a body who might chuse to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ubstitute the resolutions of one branch of the legislature, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the place of regulations formed by the united consent of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he whole.</P>

They sent their serjeant at arms, at midnight, with eve∣ry circumstance of severity and terror, to remove the pri∣soners from Newgate. The house of lords proceeding, in the mean time, on the petition for the writs of error, came to several important resolutions. They voted, that neither house of parliament had any power to create new privileges, inconsistent with the known laws and customs of parliament. That every subject of England, who thinks himself injured, has a right to seek redress by an action at law; and that the house of commons, in com∣mitting the men of Aylesbury, had entrenched on the constitution of the kingdom, by pretending to give to their own declaration the force of an established law<NOTE N="F" PLACE="foot">Printed Case.</NOTE>.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A session of parliament in Ireland.</NOTE> During these contests in England, the parliament of Ireland met at Dublin<NOTE N="H" PLACE="foot">Feb. 10.</NOTE>. The affairs of that kingdom having suffered no material change since the preceding year, the session furnished no transaction of great im∣portance. On the fifth of March, the commons, in a committee of the whole house, voted a supply of one hundred and fifty thousand pounds to her Majesty, for the support of the establishment for two years, commenc∣ing at Michaelmas 1705, and ending, at the same term in the year 1707. A bill, introduced for the improvement of the hempen and flaxen manufactures of the kingdom, raised a flame, which a prorogation only could extinguish. A clause in the bill having ascertained the tithes of flax and hemp, the lower house of convocation of the clergy of Ireland presented a memorial, signed by the prolocu∣tor, requesting the commons, that a clause so detrimen∣tal to their interest should not pass, till their reasons against it should be heard. The commons ordered the person who brought the memorial to be committed for a breach of privilege. They voted, that the convo∣cation, by pretending to have any care of the civil rights of the clergy, were guilty of a contempt of the house. They, at the same time, signified their expectation, that the convocation should make submission and ac∣knowledge their error. That assembly adhering to their memorial, the commons ordered that all matters con∣cerning it should be erazed from the journals and books of the convocation; upon which the lord-lieutenant, to put an end to the dispute, sent a message to both houses, commanding them to adjourn<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot">March 21.</NOTE> to the first of May.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The trea∣surer inti∣midated.</NOTE> The parliament of England was scarce prorogued, when a material change happened in the higher departments of the state. The natural timidity of the Lord Godol∣phin, at perpetual variance with his inclinations in favour of the excluded branch of the royal family, produced con∣tradictions and inconsistencies in his conduct, that were unaccountable, at the time, as his motives were un∣known. The Duke of Marlborough, in his conferences with the agents of the court of St. Germains, had insi∣nuated,
<PB N="296" REF="315"/>
in the name of the treasurer as well as in his own, that effectual measures should be taken in the preceding summer, to prevent the settlement of the crown upon the house of Hannover from passing into a law in Scot∣land<NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, April 1705.</NOTE>. When, therefore, the Queen recommended to the Scotish parliament to settle the succession in the Protestant line, it was suspected, with reason, that her REVEALED WILL, as the Earl of Cromarty expressed himself in his speech in the house, was very different from the SECRET INCLINATIONS of her English mi∣nister. This circumstance induced many who were in the service of the Crown, to join the country-party in the vote which rejected the proposal of settling the suc∣cession on the family of Hannover<NOTE N="L" PLACE="foot">Proceedings of parl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/></NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Joins the Whigs.</NOTE> The active leaders of the Whig-party in England, hav∣ing turned their whole attention towards the means of possessing themselves of power, kept a watchful eye on Godolphin. They were no strangers to his character, and they were resolved to work upon his fears. The Lord Wharton, in particular, knowing that nothing cal∣culated to intimidate, would be lost on Godolphin, said, upon passing the act of security in Scotland, that he <Q REND="inline">"had now the treasurer's head in a bag."</Q> The expression was coarse, but it had all its weight with the minister. The Lord Haversham represented to him his danger in a set speech in the house of lords. To save himself from their resent∣ment, he made great advances to the party during the session; and when it was closed, in the middle of March, he performed his engagements, by admitting some into office, and opening to others a prospect of preferment. The Duke of Newcastle, though during the late reign secretly in the interest of the excluded family, and in cor∣respondence with the court of St. Germains<NOTE N="M" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1694.</NOTE>, was considered by the nation as one of the principal leaders of the Whigs; and as such he was raised<NOTE N="N" PLACE="foot">March 27.</NOTE> to the office of lord-privy-seal, vacant by the dismission of the Duke of Buckingham, who was known to adhere to the prin∣ciples of the Tories. Some other changes of less impor∣tance convinced the latter, that the current of preferment ran in a channel very different from their own.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Parliament dissolved.</NOTE> The Whigs, now favoured by the Court, were soon after furnished with an opportunity of securing to them∣selves, effectually, the advantage which they had extorted from Godolphin's fears. The present parliament, in con∣sequence of the triennial act, being near expiring, the Queen, to preserve the ancient prerogatives of the Crown, chose to dissolve it by proclamation, on the fifth of April. The Tumult, clamour, and confusion that commonly at∣tend general elections, were now raised to an unusual height, by the contests and animosities between the par∣ties. The Whigs, more active than their antagonists, applied themselves to the prejudices of the vulgar. They had the art to render the Tories odious where the returns depended on the humours of the populace; and having the countenance of Government, together with the mo∣neyed interest on their side, they were enabled to awe the timid and to gain the venal. Besides, the principles which they held forth to the public, were better qualified than those of their opponents to gain the independent part of mankind, as they flattered their pride. The re∣sult of the whole was, that the elections in general went in favour of the Whigs, especially in boroughs; and thus the Tories found themselves at once divested of a power, which they had neither the courage to exert with spi∣rit<NOTE N="O" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. iv.</NOTE>, nor the prudence to use with moderation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Campaign of 1705.</NOTE> During these domestic transactions, the war was car∣ried on abroad with a degree of ardour. The Duke of Marlborough arrived in Holland in the beginning of April; and having concerted the operations of the campaign with the States, took the field in the first week in May. His great object was to improve the victories of the preceding campaign, by carrying the war by the Moselle into the heart of France. With the same number of troops as in the last year, he marched through the country of Lim∣bourg; and being joined near Treves by the Prince of Hesse, he crossed the Moselle and the Saar, marched to the defile of Taveren, and advanced to Elst. The French apprized of the designs of Marlborough, had assembled an army of seventy thousand men on that side, under the command of the Mareschal de Villars, who occupying a strong camp at Sirk, resolved to remain on the defensive.
<PB N="298" REF="317"/>
The prince of Baden, who commanded the Imperialists, either from a personal dislike to Marlborough, or unpro∣vided with the means of taking the field, disappointed him in his promise of joining the allies with the German troops; and thus the Duke remained inactive in his camp, for the space of a month, in daily hopes of a reinforce∣ment that never arrived<NOTE N="P" PLACE="foot">Hist. d'Allemagne, tom. vii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of the Empe∣or.</NOTE> The death of the Emperor Leopold, which happened on the sixth of May, changed, in nothing, the face of affairs. That Prince born with a degree of virtue, was destitute of talents. The apparent line of ambition which passed through his whole conduct, was rather the disposi∣tion of his court than any passion of his own. His son, who had been, several years before, created King of the Romans, succeeded him in the Imperial dignity. That Prince inherited his father's ministers as well as his domi∣nions; and the same counsels continued to act under the name of Joseph, that had uniformly prevailed in the reign of Leopold. The succession to the Spanish throne, the increase of the Imperial power, on the ruins of the au∣thority of the German princes, and the reduction of the insurgents in Hungary, were the principal objects of the present as well as of the late Emperor. But Joseph was better calculated than his father to succeed in these views. His mind was active and full of fire, his disposition vehe∣ment, his character enterprising; and to an industry, which ran violently from one scheme to another, he add∣ed a firmness of soul, that disdained to yield either to ac∣cident or misfortune.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Slow mea∣fares of the German</NOTE> The new Emperor, however, was incapable of infusing his own fire into the sluggish Germanic body, already lan∣guishing for repose. Destitute of resources at home, he could not even animate into action his hereditary troops; or fur∣nish his part of the strength employed, by the allies, against the common enemy. This inability in the court of Vi∣enna, combining with the envious and obstinate dispositi∣on of the Prince of Baden, forced Marlborough to aban∣den his designs of carrying the war into France, by the course of the Moselle. During the time that general re∣mained at Dellt, the French, under the Elector of Ba∣varia and the Mareschal de Villeroi, had taken Hui<NOTE N="Q" PLACE="foot">June.</NOTE>,

Having decamped, in the night, he repassed the dangerous defile of Taveren without be∣ing molested; and, directing his march toward Liege, joined the Dutch under Auverquerque, which induced the enemy to retire beyond their lines. Hui was retaken, on the twelfth of July; and the duke resolved to retrieve, with some enterprise of consequence, the glory lost by the prior inactivity of the campaign<NOTE N="R" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Marlborough.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Marlbo∣rough forces the French lines.</NOTE> To accomplish his purpose, he formed a scheme of forcing the French lines, and encamped within a league of the enemy. The Elector and the Mareschal de Ville∣roi, perceiving the design of the allies, drew their armies together, leaving only small detachments to dsend the lines, on either side. The Mehaigne ran about half a league on the right; on the left they had two barriers, for the convenience of the people of the country, at the distance of three leagues. On the seventeenth of Ju∣ly<NOTE N="S" PLACE="foot">N.

When it grew dark, this body marched toward the barriers. They were aollowed close by the army under Marlborough, and the Dutch, facing about, hastened the same way. The Elector of Bavaria, at length apprized of the Duke's de∣sign, ordered the left wing of his cavalry to march to pre∣vent the allies from passing the barriers. He himself fol∣lowed with the infantry. But the enemy had already formed within the lines. After a fierce shock between the Duke and the Bavarian infantry, the latter were ob∣liged to give way.

The French forced the lines of Wisseimbourg, on the third of July. Hombourg surrendered, on the twenty-sixth of the same month, to the Marquis de Conflans. But the Mareschal, enfeebled by detachments, was, however, un∣able to defend the lines of Haguenau, against the Prince of Baden; who, though he could not, on account of the advanced season, recover Hombourg, found means to ex∣tend his quarters into the enemy's country.

In the end of autumn, the Portugueze, and the other allies, who had quarrelled about the projected operations, opened, at length, the campaign, with the siege of Badajox.

Being joined in that place by a squadron of Dutch under Admiral Allemonde, and re∣inforced with some horse, from the Earl of Galway's army in Portugal, they took the Archkduke Charles on board, sailed to Gibraltar, and directed from thence their course to the coast of Catalonia. The arrival of of such a great force spread terror and confusion through all Spain. The fortresses os Lerida and Tortosa were delivered into the hands of the Archduke, without a blow. Barcelona was forced to capitulate; and almost the whole kingdom of Valencia, as well as the province of Catalonia, submitted themselves to the new King.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of Poland.</NOTE> The war in Poland, produced some events of import∣ance during the present campaign. The good fortune which had hitherto attended his enterprises, ceased not to favour the active spirit of the King of Sweden. But neither the success of his arms, nor his own abilities and perseverance, were capable of restoring to peace and or∣der that distracted kingdom. The cardinal primate hav∣ing issued the universalia, a diet was held, in the month of July, at Warsaw, under the protection of a body of Swedes. The Saxons, in endeavouring to disturb the deliberations of that assembly, were defeated by the ene∣my, and forced to retire with considerable loss; while, in the same month, the Russians were routed by the Swedes, in Courland, with the loss of six thousand slain. But, notwithstanding these advantages, the King of Swe∣den found it impossible to decide the fate of the war. The Czar, after the defeat of one army, poured a still greater force into Courland, and reduced the victorious Swedes to the necessity of retiring under the cannon of Riga. Mittau itself fell into his hands. The Czar be∣sieged Riga. But, despairing to take the place, directed his march towards Warsaw.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceedings</NOTE> The first motion made in parliament<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot">July 17.</NOTE>. proposed that, prior to all other business, the house should proceed to the consideration of such limitations and conditions of go∣vernment, as should be deemed necessary to circumscribe the royal authority, under the next successor in the pro∣testant line. This overture, however, was superseded, by a motion for entering, prior to any other matter, up∣on the trade of the nation. To supply the kingdom with
<PB N="304" REF="323"/>
money, two proposals for establishing paper currency were laid before the house. These were, upon a debate, rejected. But some other overtures regarding commerce were passed into a law. A council of trade was, at the same time, appointed, to put the laws of commerce in execution; and to bring the exports and imports of the nation into a balance, to be laid before the next session of parliament. During the dependence of this bill, the Duke of Hamilton presented<NOTE N="J" PLACE="foot">July 17.</NOTE> a resolve, that the no∣mination of a successor should be postponed, till a treaty with England could be obtained, with regard to the com∣merce and other concerns of the Scotish nation. Though the flying squadron, if a cant name may be used, joined their votes to those of the adherents of the court, this motion was carried by a great majority.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Intrigues of the Jaco∣bites, act of limitati∣on.</NOTE> Though the cavaliers, in conjunction with the country party, were successful in this important question, the first had formed no great hopes of succeeding to their wishes in parliament. They had, some time before the meet∣ing of that assembly, solicited the court of St. Ger∣mains<NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1705.</NOTE>, for twelve thousand French as a more pow∣erful argument in favour of their cause than idle resoluti∣ons, which, they knew, were destined to be defeated, by the great weight which the ministry of England had thrown into the opposite scale. The pressure of the al∣lies, on every side of the dominions of the house of Bour∣bon, had rendered such an expedition impossible in the eyes of the court of Versailles; and, therefore, the Jaco∣bites were left to their own address and influence in the Scotish parliament. Encouraged by the success of his last overture, the Duke of Hamilton moved, on the thir∣ty-first of July, that in preference to an act for treating with England, the house should proceed to the consider∣ation of limitations, with regard to the successor to the crown. Overtures for various acts to that purpose, were accordingly introduced; and several were passed, that, in a manner, annnihilated the power of the sovereign. Among other securities provided for the subject, an act for trinnial parliaments was agreed to by the house. But notwithstanding the solemn promises of the ministry, that it should be touched with the sceptre, when they
<PB N="305" REF="324"/>
obtained the act for a treaty with England, the royal as∣sent was refused to the triennial bill.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Act for treating with Eng∣land passed.</NOTE> There is, however, reason to believe, that the minis∣try, through the aid of their friends in England, were now enabled to convince the parliament, with arguments more solid than vague promises of procuring the royal assent to the triennial bill. The temper of the house suf∣fered suddenly such a manifest change, that the secret distribution of English money was much suspected, by those persons who remained firm to their former views. The Jacobites and country party perceiving an alteration in the sentiments of many members, when the bill for treating concerning an union with England was brought under debate, endeavoured to defeat, by conditional clauses, a measure, which it was now vain to oppose. The Duke of Hamilton moved a clause importing, that the proposed union, <Q REND="inline">"should no ways derogate from any fundamental laws, ancient privileges, offices, rights, li∣berties, and dignities of the Scotish nation."</Q> This over∣ture was so popular, that, but for the negligence of the duke's own party, seven or eight of whom happened to be absent, it must have certainly been carried: and when it even came to the vote, it was lost only by two voices. The other attempts made by the cavaliers to clog the act, were impotent and ill-supported. The act for treat∣ing with England was passed, without any considerable amendments; and the parliament having finished this important business, and granted the demanded supplies, were adjourned, on the twenty-first of September.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">October. New parlia∣ment of England meets.</NOTE> On the twenty-fifth of October, the new parliament of England, after various prorogations, met at Westmin∣ster. The great success of the Whigs, in the late elec∣tions, appeared in the choice of a speaker, for the house of commons. The high-church party having proposed Mr. Bromley, who had distinguished himself in the de∣bates on the bill against occasional conformity, as a zea∣lous adherent of Toryism, the Whigs opposed him, with the nomination of Mr. Smith.

The

She urged, with earnestness, the necessity of prosecuting the war, to re∣store the balance of power, which, she said, the posses∣sion of Spain by the house of Bourbon, had destroyed. She demanded the necessary supplies, for supporting the operations of the allies, as well as for exerting the force of her own kingdoms. She informed them of the act passed in Scotland, for treating concerning an union; and she concluded, with taking an obvious part with the Whigs, by declaring that the church was in no danger; a circumstance urged with vehemence by the Tories, to arm the prejudices of the populace to favour their own designs.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">November. A supply.

The war was not the topic upon which the contending parties resolved to try their force. Public pretences were invariably used throughout this reign, by the leaders of the two parties, to cover their own private designs upon office and the possession of power. The leaders of the Tories, on the one hand, expressed the utmost solicitude for the church of England. Those of the Whigs discovered a wonderful zeal for the succession of the Crown in the protestant line. They both assailed the weakness of their less intelligent followers, through these channels; and, arming themselves with the preju∣dices of the populace, endeavoured alternately to take the cabinet by storm. The Tories, having been desert∣ed by the ministry, applied themselves to the people. Papers, publications, and pamphlets, were written with zeal and propagated with ardour; and the nation were perpetually alarmed with insinuations of secret conspi∣racies,
<PB N="307" REF="326"/>
and open attacks made by the ministry and Whigs, upon the doctrines and even against the very being of the church of England.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Inconsisten∣cy of the Tories.</NOTE> Though the Whigs yielded not to the Tories, in be∣speaking the favour of the populace against their oppo∣nents, the latter were guilty of inconsistencies, which threw discredit on their party. To harass their sove∣reign, to embarrass their political enemies, perhaps to gain some popularity for themselves, and, above all, to vent their resentment against the minister, they had long before the meeting of parliament<NOTE N="O" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1705.</NOTE>, resolved to pro∣pose, either by bill or address, to demand from the Queen, that the Princess Sophia should be invited into the kingdom, as the next heir of the crown. A proposal of the same kind, when urged by the Whigs, had been rejected by the Tories themselves, when possessed of power. But neither the inconsistency of the measure, nor its contrariety to their own private opinions, could prevail with them to forego a motion, from which they hoped to derive less advantage to their own views, than a kind of malignant pleasure in disconcerting their ene∣mies. On the fifteenth of November, the Lord Haver∣sham, chosen upon the occasion to be the mouth of the party, after having, in a set speech, inveighed against the conduct of the allies, in the last campaign, and, by implication, blamed the Duke of Marlborough, conclud∣ed with a motion, that her Majesty should be addressed to invite the presumptive heir, according to the act of set∣tlement, into England<NOTE N="P" PLACE="foot">Haversham's speech, Nov <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> 1705.</NOTE>.</P>

To these arguments, they added others of little weight, as they themselves were deemed insincere. The Whigs, by a strange reverse, were forced to oppose the motion, to preserve their own influence with the Queen. They alleged, that it was neither safe for the crown nor secure for the nation, that the presumptive heir should not be in an entire depen∣dence on the reigning sovereign; and they urged, with propriety, that the rivalship between the two courts, would inevitably involve the kingdom in all the distracti∣ons incident to the animosities of counteracting parties and interests<NOTE N="R" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. iv.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bill of re∣gency.</NOTE> The weight of the party in power contributed, how∣ever, more to the rejecting of the motion than the force of argument.

A cry that the church was in danger, had been propagated with such industry, without doors, that the Whigs resolved to check the panic which had spread among the people, by a declaratory vote in parliament. The Lord Halifax, having moved for a day to examine into the pretended danger of the church, a debate en∣sued, more expressive of the violence of the parties, than suitable to the subject. The act of security in Scotland, the loss of the bill of occasional conformity in England, the absence of the next successor to the crown, beyond seas, the increase of presbyterian academies, and the licentiousness of the press, were produced by the Tories, as proofs of the danger of the church. The Whigs argued, on the other side, that the Scotish act of security regarded only temporal concerns. That the ab∣sence of the successor was supplied by the act of regen∣cy. That the bill of occasional conformity having been considered and rejected by the house, the question was now determined; and that the Presbyterian academies were scarce more numerous than those taught by Non∣jurors. They agreed with the Tories, that the licenti∣ousness of the press had been carried to extremities; but by none further, than by the pretended friends of the church of England. A vote was passed, with which the commons concurred, that the church was in a safe and flourishing condition; and that whoever should suggest that the established religion was in danger, was an enemy to the Queen, the church, and the kingdom<NOTE N="T" PLACE="foot">Dec. 6, 1705.</NOTE>.</P>

But their opponents yielding prudently the point, without opposition, they were disappointed in their views. The act declaring the Scots aliens by a cer∣tain day, was not only reversed; the Whigs went still further, and moved that the act relating to the manu∣facture and trade of Scotland should be also repealed. These measures, by opening a way for an immediate treaty, were as popular as they were necessary. Though a majority of the parliament of Scotland were already gained by private means, the body of the people were still inflamed to a degree of fury, with regard to their independence as a nation. Any backwardness in the par∣liament of England, on the subject of the compulsatory laws, would have brought matters to extremities; and, considering the party in favour of the lineal succession among the English, a war could scarce terminate in any event short of a subversion of the settlement of the crown in the Protestant line.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Unanimity with regard to the war.</NOTE> The same unanimity which was observed with regard to Scotland, was pursued without deviation in whatever concerned the effectual prosecution of the war.

They were roused with libels and pamphlets which zealots, on both sides, poured daily from the press; and they suffered themselves, as usual, to be deceived by the de∣signing, or inflamed by the violent and weak. Among the publications concerning the proposed invitation of the presumptive heir of the crown to England, one com∣manded the attention and incurred the censure of parlia∣ment.

Upon the subject of the invita∣tion to the Princess Sophia, Gwyne wrote a letter to the Earl of Stamford which found its way to the press. This ill-worded, unmeaning, and confused performance, though it seemed to approve of the principles of the Whigs, se∣verely censured that party for refusing their consent to the proposed invitation of the Princess Sophia into Eng∣land. The commons, on the eighth of March, voted Gwyne's letter a scandalous, false, and malicious libel.

<MILESTONE N="1706" UNIT="year"/> The contest between parties, contrary to former experi∣ence, had been productive, in this session, of measures considered highly favourable to the prosperity and repose of the kingdom. The Tories, in endeavouring to take the ground of the Whigs, and to appropriate to them∣selves their popularity, produced the act of regency, which gave the first great security to the descent of the crown in the Protestant line. Though the laws had fixed the succession on the house of Hannover, five years before, the supposed attachment of the Queen to her own family, the numerous party known to be well∣affected to the pretended Prince of Wales, the preju∣dices of the people against foreigners, and the memory of the inconvenience of connexions abroad in the last reign, had rendered the success of the act of settlement extremely doubtful. During this state of uncertainty, little court was paid by the subjects of England to the electoral family. Few visited the court of Hannover; and those who made their appearance there, either through zeal or weakness, like Gwyne, hurt the cause which they meant to serve<NOTE N="Z" PLACE="foot">Hannover-papers.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Act of re∣gency, &amp;c. sent to Hannover.</NOTE> The Princess Sophia herself, either suspecting the sin∣cerity of Queen Anne and her ministers, or misled by the representations of the new English who resorted to the court of Hannover, entertained little hopes that her family should ever mount the throne. She even seems to have placed no value on the acts of regency and natu∣ralization which passed in the present session<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. She probably soon after changed her sentiments. On the fourth of April, her grandson, the electoral prince, was made a knight-companion of the garter. The Lord Ha∣lifax, accompanied by Clarencieux king at arms, was sent to Hannover to carry the ensigns of the order to the prince, and to present the act of naturalization to his fa∣mily. The current began to run with vehemence in that channel. The lords who could claim any merit in pro∣moting the acts in savour of the house of Hannover, made their court with letters full of expressions of at∣tachment and zeal. The Whigs adopted chiefly this mode of removing the unfavourable impressions made on the minds of the electoral family, by the inconside∣rate

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Observations</NOTE> The strife between the Whigs and Tories, in shew∣ing an appearance of zeal for the family of Hannover, proceeded more from the selfish views of their respective leaders, than from motives of public good. To secure the good opinion of the people, in countries possessed of liberty, is the shortest way of gaining, and the surest means of retaining power. In the political farces too fre∣quently exhibited by parties, the populace are the specta∣tors; and those who suit their antick gestures best to their prejudices, carry the most applause. Two princi∣ples had long been predominant in the minds of the Eng∣lish nation: a fixed aversion to France; and a zeal, which bordered on enthusiasm, for the protestant religion. The manly spirit which undeviatingly looks forward to public freedom, independent of common prejudices, fell only to the share of a few. The pretence to that spirit, though a stale imposture, seldom failed to impose on the world. The Whigs, when they affected to give the great security to the Protestant succession, paid their court to the populace, in a manner inconsistent with the avowed principles of their party. They repealed, in the bill of regency, the limitations which the Tories had imposed on the successor in the act of settlement; and, with a frankness scarce consistent with common prudence, boasted openly, that they restored to the crown all its former prerogatives. The spirit of party, however, had been carried to such a pitch, that every measure calcu∣lated to annoy their adversaries, was deemed, not only justifiable, but even laudable, by both sides.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Secret con∣duct of Go∣dolphin.</NOTE> Though the happy timidity of the Lord Godolphin had much contributed to give the great security to the Protestant succession, he was too much attached to the excluded family to take any merit to himself with their rivals. His actions were even at variance with his prin∣ciples in his public conduct. In his private capacity, with an odd inconsistent species of sincerity, he avoided to make professions where he wished not to be of service. When he promoted, in the face of the world, the suc∣cession of the house of Hannover, he continued his inter∣course
<PB N="314" REF="333"/>
with the family of Stuart, through their agents<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1706.</NOTE>. His fears of impeachment, however, prevailed over his affection for the excluded race. Though the Duke of Marlborough had promised<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>, in his name, to the agents of the court of St. Germains, that no money should be given to gain votes for the union, in the parliament of Scotland, the terrors of Godolphin returned, and he open∣ed the treasury to the avarice of the venal and the ne∣cessities of the needy. The secret spring which moved the great measures of his administration, lay in a defect of his mind; and, by a singular piece of good fortune, to his character, his country ascribed to his distinguished parts, a line of conduct which sprung from his political cowardice.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Campaign of 1706.</NOTE> During these important transactions at home, prepara∣tions were made abroad for opening, with vigour, the campaign, on every side. The Duke of Marlborough having left the Hague, on the ninth of May, joined, on the twentieth of the month, the united armies of Eng∣land and the States, between Borchloen and Groszwa∣ren. France, in an evil hour for herself, had resolved to act offensively in Flanders. The Mareschal de Villeroi, issuing from the lines which he had formed behind the Deule, advanced to Tirlemont; and, without waiting for the arrival of the Elector of Bavaria, with whom he was joined in the command, pushed forward precipitate∣ly to Ramillies. When his front had advanced to the heights where rises the little Geette, he perceived the allies, on full march, appearing in sight. He immedi∣ately formed his army in order of battle. The Geette and an impassable morass running along its banks, covered his left wing; and prevented it alike from being attacked itself and from charging the enemy. The village of Ramillies, situated in a plain near the source of the Geette, was advanced before his centre, which consisted entirely of infantry. The village of Tavieres, on the banks of the Mehaigne, covered his right wing; and an open and level space, between Tavieres and Ramillies, about a mile and a half in length, was filled with one hundred squadrons of horse. In this narrow aperture the

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of</NOTE> On a rising ground, opposed to the left of the enemy, along the swampy side of the Geette, the Duke of Marl∣borough formed his right. His line extended through the plain to the left, which was covered by the river Me∣haigne. Having, by a feigned attack, on the right of the French, which was, in fact, impracticable, deceiv∣ed the Mareschal de Villeroi, he obtained his purpose of obliging the enemy to thin their left, which introduced a confusion, while it weakened their line in the only place where they could be attempted with advantage. The Duke, in the mean time, ordered Auverquerque, with the Dutch infantry, to begin the battle on the left, while he himself, covering his motions with the rising ground, fell at once on the centre of the enemy, with all the foot that formed his own. The French making a gallant resistance, Marlborough ordered all his cavalry to make a home charge. But, in the hurry, he himself, being a bad horseman, falling to the ground, was in dan∣ger of being trampled to death by his own squadrons. Being remounted, he pursued his plan of attack, while, at the same time, the Danish horse, under the Duke of Wirtemberg, fell on their flank, and completing the dis∣order which Marlborough had begun, the whole centre of the enemy, on which the stress of the battle lay, were routed and put to flight<NOTE N="F" PLACE="foot">Mem. de Fequiere.</NOTE>.

To com∣plete the misfortunes of the French, the remarkable cir∣cumstance, which happened at the village of Blenheim two years before, was a second time exhibited, at that of Ramillies. Eight battalions, which De Villeroi had placed in that village in his front, maintained their post,

till they perceived their main body driven from the field. In endeavouring to retreat, toward their left, which had not been at all engaged, they were attacked by the caval∣ry of the allies, before they could form themselves in the field.

The consequences of this rout were as important in them∣selves, as they were striking and extraordinary. The fugitives were not to be rallied, till they had carried themselves, not only beyond the pursuit, but even the very report of the enemy. Their first stand was made about eighty miles from the field of battle. Nor durst they even remain at Courtray, where first they formed the appearance of an army. Some were placed in the frontier garrisons of France. The boldest formed them∣ed themselves into two inconsiderable flying armies, more calculated to amuse, than to oppose a victorious enemy. The total conquest of Brabant, and almost all Spanish Flanders, was the immediate consequence of the victory. Louvain, Brussels, Answerp, Mechlin, Alost, Ghent, and Oudenarde, surrendered without firing a gun; and the first stop was put to the progress of the allies, by Dendermonde and Ostende. The latter, however, was forced to capitulate, after the trenches were open eight days. Menin surrendered, after an obstinate resistance;

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Campaign in Italy.</NOTE> The Mareschal de Villeroi being recalled, he was suc∣ceeded in his command by the Duke de Vendôme The removal of the last from Italy, contributed to fresh mis∣fortunes, which lost to the house of Bourbon, Savoy, Piedmont, and the whole Milanese. The beginning of the campaign in Italy, was favourable for France and Spain. The Duke of Berwick took the castle of Nice, on the fourth of January. Vendôme, having defeated the Germans at Calcinato, on the nineteenth of April, order∣ed Turin itself to be invested, on the third of May. The trenches were opened by the French, on the night of the second of June; and the fate of the war in Italy seemed to depend on the taking of that important place. The Duke of Savoy avoiding to shut himself up in his capital, and hav∣ing sent his family to Genoa, retired with a few troops to the vallies of Lucerne, among his protestant subjects the Vaudois. The strength of the town, the bravery of the garrison, together with the languor, and even unskilful∣ness of the enemy, who were nominally under the com∣mand of the Duke of Orleans, protracted the siege to the beginning of September, when a great event put an end, in Italy, to all the hopes and efforts of the house of Bourbon.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Turin.</NOTE> Prince Eugene, who commanded the German army, on the frontiers of the dominions of Venice, after a long and painful march, and having passed several rivers and many defiles, without being opposed, arrived in the neigh∣bourhood of Turin, in the first week of September, joined the Duke Savoy, and resolved to attack the ene∣my.

Though the enemy had made little impression on the works, the gar∣crison began to be in great danger, through the want of ammunition. No time was, therefore, to be lost. The Prince, having made his dispositions for the attack, fell suddenly on the entrenchments of the enemy; and, after

an obstinate contest, for two hours, entered their camp, drove them from the field, took all their cannon, mor∣tars, heavy baggage, ammunition, and implements em∣ployed in the siege. The Duke of Orleans himself was wounded. The Mareschal de Marsin was killed. The fugitives, instead of retiring to Casal, which would have maintained the Milanese, directed their retreat to Pigne∣rol. In the space of four hours, the Modenese, the Man∣tuan, the Milanese, Piedmont, and ultimately the king∣dom of Naples, were lost to the house of Bourbon. A complete victory obtained by the Count de Medavi, over a small army of Imperialists, under the command of the Prince of Hesse, two days after the battle before Turin, served only to aggravate the misfortunes of that action<NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">German accounts.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Progress of the war,</NOTE> The house of Bourbon were persecuted in Spain, with misfortunes similar to those which they suffered in Flan∣ders and in Italy. Except the taking of Villareal, which was forced, on the eighth of January, by the Conde de Las-Torres, the whole of the campaign formed one con∣tinued train of disgraces and losses. The Archduke Charles having, by the aid of the English, established himself in the winter in Spain, Philip the Fifth, and the Mareschal de Tesse advanced, with twenty thousand men, and shut him up at Barcelona, while the Comte de Toulouse blocked up the place by sea, with a French fleet. When a practicable breach was made, a fortunate accident preserved the place, and, with it, the footing which the allies had established in Spain. A superior fleet appearing, under Sir John Leake, on the coast, the Comte de Toulouse precipitately retired in the night. A reinforcement of troops was thrown into Barcelona. Philip and the Mareschal de Tessé raised the siege in the utmost confusion. An almost total eclipse of the sun, which happened on the twelfth of May, and covered the country with a sudden darkness, compleated the conster∣nation of the superstitions Spaniards. They abandoned their camp, their provisions, their cannon, their imple∣ments of war; and were pursued, with slaughter, by the enemy, through the uncommon darkness which had ex∣cited so much their fear. Philip having taken a circuit,

They entered Estramadura, they took Alcanta∣ra, they forced Cividad-Rodrigo, Salamanca, and the post of Espinar. They directed their march, and pene∣trated, without resistance, to Madrid. Philip the Fifth, having abandoned his capital, removed the Queen and the court to Burgos. The English and the Portugueze entered the city in triumph; and to complete the mis∣fortunes of the King of Spain, he received intelligence, that the count de Sancta-Cruz had delivered Carthagena and the gallies to the enemy. The unaccountable errors of the English and Portugueze prevented the Spanish crown from being for ever transferred from the house of Bourbon. They loitered in the midst of disease, de∣bauchery and sloth, at Madrid, till they were roused by the approach of Philip, with a superior force. Galway and Las-Minas were forced to retire from Madrid. Hav∣ing joined the Archduke, they passed into the kingdom of Valencia; and disposed their quarters in such a man∣ner, as to cover the kingdoms of Arragon and Catalonia, and maintain a free entrance into Castile. The Duke of Berwick hung close on their retreat; and, before the end of the campaign, retook Carthagena. But that loss was balanced, by the reduction of the islands of Majorca and Ivica, which the English fleet, under Sir John Leake, sub∣jected to the dominion of the Archduke<NOTE N="M" PLACE="foot">Ibid.

But oppressed with the misfortunes which attended the arms of France in every other quarter, Villars discovered a kind of melancholy consolation, in having found himself capable of avoiding disasters, without endeavouring to retrieve, in Germany, the laurels which his country had lost on every other side.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Naval transactions.</NOTE> The operations of the fleet, in the Mediterranean, contributed much to the success of the allies, on the side of Spain. But no naval transaction of any importance happened in the ocean. A Frenchman, who assumed the title and character of the Marquis de Guiscard, had, with a kind of vivacity, which passed upon the world for parts, insinuated himself into the favour and confidence of the English ministry, and formed the plan of an expe∣dition to the coast of France. In compliance with the in∣telligence communicated by this adventurer, land forces, to the number of ten thousand men, were sent on board of transports, under the protection of the confederate fleets, commanded in chief by Sir Cloudsley Shovel. The Earl of Rivers, a man of a profligate character<NOTE N="P" PLACE="foot">Swist's Notes of Macky, MS.</NOTE>, and venal principles, but personally brave, was placed at the head of the forces destined for the expedition. But the plan was so indefinite and ill-projected, that a con∣trary wind, which drove back the fleet, and confined the ships of war and transports to the channel, till the season for action was past, might be considered as a singular in∣terposition of good fortune. The avowed scheme of the Marquis de Guiscard was to restore liberty to France but he behaved himself with such tyranny and folly, in a command in which he had been placed by the indulgence of the English government, that he was recalled from the fleet, at the special request of the admiral.</P>

a material change. The death of Augustus Frederic, Bishop of Lubec, had threatened, in the end of the pre∣ceding year, to involve the north in new troubles. Prince Charles of Denmark, and the Duke Administrator of Holstein-Gottorp, had their respective pretensions on the vacant bishopric. The latter took possession in virtue of an election made of himself, in the quality of coadju∣tor. Prince Charles, supported by his brother, the King of Denmark, made himself master, by force, of the castle of Eutin; while the King of Sweden and the Elector of Hannover declared themselves on the other side. While the forces of the two last Princes were rea∣dy to march against the Danes, the Queen of England and the States of the United Provinces interposed their good offices, in quenching the flame which was ready to involve the whole north in a fresh war. The troops of Denmark retired from the castle of Eutin; and the place was delivered, in sequestration, to the residents of Eng∣land and Holland.

Mankind turned their attention to that monarch, in a degree equal to their hopes from his spirit, or their fears from his power. France courted his friendship, with a vehemence propor∣tionable to the distressed condition of her affairs. The emperor dreaded that the presence of Charles in Germa∣ny might kindle disturbances, which, by employing the force of the empire at home, might disappoint the views of his own family on the Spanish throne. The diet of Ratisbon shewed a disposition of declaring the King of Sweden an enemy so the empire. But the Emperor himself found means to soften any resentment that might arise in the breast of that enterprising Prince, by flattering his pride. Besides, the mind of Charles was too much engaged with the design of reducing the Czar of Mus∣covy into the same abject condition with the Elector of Saxony, to permit him to entertain thoughts of any other kind. He, therefore, listened, without being moved, to the instances of France; and yielded to the desire of the Emperor, without any attachment to his cause<NOTE N="S" PLACE="foot">Historia Polona, p. 32.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Articles of Union set∣tled</NOTE> While the present year was rendered remarkable abroad, with military transactions of great importance and renown, it was distinguished at home, by an event equally memorable in the civil line. The Queen, in consequence of powers vested in her person, by the par∣liaments of England and Scotland, had appointed com∣missioners
<PB N="323" REF="342"/>
of both nations to meet, and treat concerning an Union of the two kingdoms. They met accordingly, for the first time, at the Cockpit, on the sixteenth of April; and, having continued their sittings, at intervals, to the twenty-third of July, they presented the articles upon which they had agreed, to her Majesty. The most material of these were the following: That the two kingdoms should be united into one, by the name of Great Britain. That the succession of the united king∣dom should remain to the Princess Sophia and the heirs of her body, being protestants. That the whole people of Britain should be represented by one parliament, in which sixteen peers and forty-five commoners chosen for Scotland, should sit and vote. That the subjects of the united kingdom should enjoy a full freedom and intercourse of trade and navagation; and a reciprocal communication of all other rights, privileges, and advantages, belonging to the subjects of either kingdom.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Views and</NOTE> But though the commissioners had settled, without much difficulty, the articles of union, there was reason to apprehend, that the treaty would meet with great op∣position, in the parliament of Scotland. The body of the people, either swayed by the adherents of the excluded family, or yielding to the dictates of their pride, were ut∣terly averse to a measure which annihilated them, in a manner, as a nation. The hopes of the court of St. Germains rose in proportion, to the violence which pre∣vailed among the Scots. Relying, in some degree, on the promises of the Duke of Marlborough<NOTE N="T" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers.</NOTE>, that no money should be sent from the treasury of England, to gain votes in Scotland, they hoped that the treaty would he rejected by a majority in parliament; and they extend∣ed their views to an immediate advantage to their own cause, from a certainty of the disturbances that were to ensue. Their party in Scotland, endeavoured, in the the mean time, to be provided against the worst events. Conscious of the venality of many of their own number, they could not trust the fate of the measure to their avow∣ed principles. They, therefore, demanded succours <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>om France; and resolved to appeal from parliament to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>e decision of the sword. Having long foreseen what
<PB N="324" REF="343"/>
afterwards happened, they had opened a communication with Lewis the Fourteenth, whose interest, they knew, especially in the untoward state of his affairs, was inti∣mately connected with their cause.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">secret in∣trigues</NOTE> The eagerness with which the Whigs in England pressed the ministry of that kingdom to accomplish an uni∣on with Scotland, had greatly increased the number of the friends of the excluded family. In the two preceding years, the Jacobites had made frequent proposals to the French King, to which he paid little attention, as long as the misfortunes of the war had left him the power of giving effectual aid. To satisfy himself, however, con∣cerning the solidity of the assurances transmitted repeat∣edly from Scotland, he sent one Hooke, an English Ca∣tholic, and a colonel in his service, with letters from himself and the pretended Prince of Wales, to the lea∣ders of the malecontents in that kingdom. Hooke arriv∣ing in the month of August 1705, executed his commis∣sion in a manner calculated to defeat his own views. Attaching himself to a particular set of the cavaliers, he offended the rest; while his extreme vanity and arrogance disgusted some, and rendered all unwilling to trust them∣selves in his hands. They, however, made general assu∣rances of their fidelity, and promised their utmost exerti∣ons in favour of the excluded family, should the French King land the Pretender in Scotland, with a force suffici∣ent to protect his person, till his friends should assemble in arms<NOTE N="U" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">of the Jaco∣bites.</NOTE> Hooke, having received these general assurances, re∣turned to France; and the Jacobites unanimously made choice of one Captain Stratton, as their agent, to inquire into the real disposition of the court of Versailles. They had previously sounded the Tories in England, particu∣larly the Duke of Leeds and the Lord Granville. But they found them more cautious than themselves; and un∣willing to agree to any attempt in favour of the pretend∣ed Prince of Wales, during the life and reign of his sis∣ter Queen Anne. The Scots, however, were not dis∣couraged. Urged by their violent principles, and beyond measure averse to the union, they resolved to hazard every thing to accomplish their views. Stratton was well

received by the court of Versailles. But the battles of Ramillies and Turin had disconcerted all their measures. Lewis declared, that he could spare neither men nor mo∣ney, in the present untoward state of his affairs. That, however, he would search for a more favourable con∣juncture, and effectually support the cause of the ex∣cluded family. With these assurances, and with letters from the Pretender to the leaders of his party, Stratton returned; and the Jacobites found themselves obliged to abandon the fate of the union to their efforts, in conjunc∣tion with the country-party, in the approaching session of parliament.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 3. Parliament meets.</NOTE> They, however, entertained no hopes of success, nor had they reason to expect it in a legal way. They were strangers neither to the venality of the members, nor to the effectual measures taken by the court of England to gain a majority, through the channels of ambition and avarice. The repeated promises of the Duke of Marlbo∣rough<NOTE N="W" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1705, 1706.</NOTE>, to the court of St. Germains, that no mo∣ney should be sent to Scotland, were little regarded by Go∣dolphin. His fears for himself had overcome his attach∣ment to the excluded family; and, though he seemed, from the wretched pittance he bestowed, in some mea∣sure unwilling to ensure success, no sum was too little for purchasing the votes of the Scotish members. A great majority being thus procured, the parliament, to which Queensberry was appointed commissioner, was suffered to meet, on the third of October. The treaty of Union be∣ing read, was ordered to be printed, and the house ad∣journed for seven days. The people, who had been hitherto soothed with favourable reports of the articles, became outrageous, finding themselves, as they thought, deceived.

being over-ruled, together with another for a delay of eight days, the house proceeded to the consideration of the treaty, article by article. On every vote, a majority of more than two to one appeared for the Union. The peers, who gained the least by the treaty, were the most eager for its being approved. Many of that order, in particular the Earl of Roxburgh, sacrificed their former zeal against an union, to promises of being advanced to higher honours. Others yielded to their necessities, or listened to their avarice. Some, who perceived the vio∣lence of the Jacobites, abetted, through principle, a trea∣ty, which was likely to put an end to the romantic schemes of that restless party. A few, tired of the un∣meaning factions which had so long distracted the king∣dom, favoured the Union from a view of repose. All seemed to be flattered with the hopes of extending, in time, over Great Britain, those privileges and honours which were now confined to a narrow corner of the island. These motives combining with that subserviency to the views of the reigning prince, which peers derive from the crown with their patents, threw the weight of the no∣bility of Scotland on the side of a treaty, that seemed calculated to render their order insignificant, if not con∣temptible.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tumults in Scotland.</NOTE> The whole month of October<NOTE N="Y" PLACE="foot">Proceedings of Scot. parl.</NOTE> was spent in reading and debating, article by article, the treaty of Union. Though no decisive vote was yet proposed, the people perceived from the complexion of the house, that the whole would be approved by the parliament. During the debates the mob rose at Edinburgh, and committed every species of outrage and extravagance. The members who favoured the Union, the servants of government, and the commissioner himself, were menaced and insulted. Those who opposed the treaty were received with the acclama∣tions of the populace every where, and denominated the friends, patrons, and even saviours of their native land. But when, in the beginning of November, the parlia∣ment proceeded to approve of the articles, addresses against the Union were poured in from every side. The populace, roused to a degree of fury, throughout the
<PB N="327" REF="346"/>
kingdom, threatened to come in a body to Edinburgh, to dissolve a parliament which, they said, was ready to be∣tray their country. In Glasgow, in particular, the inha∣bitants took arms, drove their magistrates out of the city, insulted such as favoured the Union, and hung, in effigy, the commissioners who had agreed to that treaty. The uncommon rigour of the season could only save the par∣liament from the vengeance of the people; who, had they not been prevented by the inclemency of the wea∣ther, were determined to pour from every quarter to Edinburgh, to tear to pieces the obnoxious part of their representatives<NOTE N="Z" PLACE="foot">Mem. of Scotland.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Debates in the house.</NOTE> While the populace exhibited such symptoms of sury without doors, the country-party endeavoured to rouse the spirit of the members within. Mr. Fletcher of Sal∣ton, the Lord Belhaven, and particularly the Duke of Hamilton, used, upon the occasion, all the force of their pathetic eloquence. On the subject of the unequal re∣presentation of Scotland, the latter expressed himself in terms full of animation and force. <Q REND="inline">"Shall we then, in an hour,"</Q> he said, <Q REND="inline">"yield with a vote, what our fa∣thers maintained, for so many ages, with the sword? Am I now heard by none of the descendants of those illustri∣ous patriots, who aided Bruce to restore the constitution, to revenge the treachery of England, to overturn the mean usurpation of Baliol? Where are the Douglasses? Where the Campbels? Where are the peers, and where the barons, once the bulwark of our nation? Have they left no posterity either to improve on their glory, or to defend the rights which they have transmitted from anci∣ent times? The children of those who aided them in the pursuit of honour, are more faithful to the reputation of their ancestors. The people have neither forgot nor contemned the freedom which their fathers preserved with their blood. But the nobles, a degenerate race, are rea∣dy to stain the honours, though they bear the titles, of their ancestors. Shall we then tamely give up the inde∣pendence and sovereignty of our country, when we are entreated and even commanded to preserve them, by those whom we represent? Shall we yield to our fears, or, if possible, to meaner motives, when we are assured
<PB N="328" REF="347"/>
of the support of a whole nation, roused to rage by in∣dignity and shame."</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arguments</NOTE> To these declamatory apostrophes, the Duke and other members added arguments of a more solid kind<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Mem. of Scotland.</NOTE>. They averred, that all the advantages from a participa∣tion of government with England, and the repose that might be expected from an union with a powerful king∣dom, were but mean considerations for the spirit which the people must lose with their independence as a nation. They argued, that though individuals might profit by the change, the country in general must suffer decay from the removal of the seat of government, which, like the heart in the human frame, threw life and vigour from the center to the extremities of the kingdom. They affirmed, that instead of bringing a part of the commerce of England into Scotland, the Union would ruin that of the latter kingdom, by carrying away from their native country, to which they would probably never return, the most enterprising and the most industrious of its in∣habitants. They said, that imposts already laid on the trade of England, would more than counter-balance the present disadvantages of that of the Scots, whose imports and exports were less burdened; and they affirmed, that though some change for the better might happen, with regard to commerce in some particular places, that cir∣cumstance ought rather to be ascribed to an increase of industry in a few individuals, than to the general prospe∣rity of the country.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">against the Union.</NOTE> They descended from these more obvious arguments, to speculative observations. They affirmed, that Scot∣land, as an independent kingdom, ought to have met England on equal ground. They said, that an Union which deprived any subject of the rights which he already possessed, looked more like terms obtained from the in∣dulgence of conquerors, than a treaty voluntarily con∣cluded between free nations for mutual advantage. They averred, that the Scottish peers, by relinquishing the right of their order to sit and vote in parliament, had be∣trayed the honour of their country, and actually altered its constitution; and that the small number of the re∣presentatives of the people, had effectually thrown the
<PB N="329" REF="348"/>
nation under the dominion of strangers, while it deprived many individuals of the honour and advantage of having a share in framing laws by which they were to be govern∣ed. They derived an argument against the Union, from the dangers in which it might involve even the freedom of England, and consequently that of Scotland, as united with that kingdom, in its misfortunes, rather than in its advantages. The representatives of the Scots, they said, would inevitably become a poor and despicable race, de∣pending on the purse, and consequently on the will of the Crown; and having shewn so little concern for the support of their own constitution, it was not to be ex∣pected they would pay any regard to that of another nation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The articles approved.</NOTE> On the other side it was urged with vehemence, that the Union, in the present state of affairs, was necessary, and that no better terms could be obtained from the Eng∣lish nation. To this the Duke of Hamilton fiercely re∣plied; that <Q REND="inline">"he thought the Scots, being on the same continent with the English, might furnish their own com∣missioners with a very decisive argument on that subject."</Q> A profound silence followed these words<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">Oct. 29.</NOTE>. None of∣fered to make any reply to an observation which was, in fact, unanswerable. Though Scotland had been long torn to pieces with violent factions and obstinate parties, the Union had become much more necessary for England than for that kingdom. Had, therefore, the parliament of Scotland regarded their own future interest more than a trival advantage at present, there is scarce any doubt but they could have commanded terms more consonant to the independence which they claimed in the name of their country. But though the Jacobites ascribed the passing of the act of Union to the venality of the members, they might with equal justice accuse their own want of spirit and folly. The Duke of Hamilton himself, who shewed so much vehemence in speaking, yielded, when matters demanded action, to a happy timidity, more de∣cisive, with regard to the Union, than all the purchased votes of his opponents<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">Mem. of Scot. Annals of Q Anne.</NOTE>. Having settled with all those who opposed the treaty, to quit, under a protest, the house in a body, he shrunk unexpectedly from his own

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Presby∣terians re∣solve to disperse the parliament.</NOTE> The prudence, timidity, or, according to the Jaco∣bites, the treachery and private views of the Duke of Hamilton, by disconcerting the opposition, were the chief springs on which the success of the Union turned<NOTE N="E" PLACE="foot">Hooke's Negociations.</NOTE>. The lower sort of people throughout the kingdom were inflamed to a degree of madness, at the thoughts of be∣ing subjected, as they construed the consequences of the Union, to the government and tyranny of the English nation. The act of security, by placing arms in their hands two years before, had rendered them fit for war. The nobility and chiefs of clans, under the sanction of law, had, for two successive summers, called their vas∣sals to the field, formed encampments, and established a degree of discipline. The Presbyterians of the West, who had suffered much under the government of the house of Stuart, were now the most violent to forward their cause, by defeating the Union, and consequently the succession in the family of Hannover. They sent to inform the Duke of Hamilton, that they were preparing to march to Edinburgh to disperse, to use their own ex∣pressions, a wretched parliament, who by suffering them∣selves to be purchased to the betraying of the honour, prosperity, and independence of their country, had for∣feited their right to determine for their constituents, and had become an assembly of lawless and abandoned rob∣bers<NOTE N="F" PLACE="foot">Let∣ter of the Laird of Kersland, MS.</NOTE>. The Duke of Hamilton opposed neither the justness of their opinions nor the propriety of their de∣signs. But he prevented the execution of the latter, by shewing them that it was not yet the proper time The Earl of Strathmore and the Viscount Stormont made the same violent offers for the counties of Perth and Angus, but they were also disappointed by the Duke of Hamilton.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They are prevented by the Duke of Hamilton.</NOTE> This mysterious conduct of Hamilton requires to be explained. He was in his principles a violent Jacobite, from the Revolution to the end of the second year of
<PB N="331" REF="350"/>
Queen Anne. His undeviating adherence to the interest of James the Second, his industry and negociations in that Prince's favour in England, till the affair of Darien had rendered Scotland a more promising field for intrigue, had gained to the Duke an unbounded confidence from the court of St. Germains. He conducted himself ac∣cording to their instructions, and THEY paid the utmost deference to his advice. When the country-party, in conjunction with the Jacobites, had carried repeated re∣solutions in parliament, that the successor to the crown of England should NOT mount the throne of Scotland, a gleam of royalty seems to have opened on the Duke of Hamilton's mind. This cooled his zeal for the family of Stuart and disconcerted his own measures, by being an object too great and too difficult for his limited capacity. Though after the posterity of James the First of Eng∣land, the Duke was the next Protestant heir to the crown of Scotland, he was, by no means, qualified to gratify his ambition. His estate was not great, and he was over∣whelmed with debt. He had few vassals and scarce any followers, except such as looked up to him as the head placed over them by the court of St. Germains. When he hesitated to join in their violent schemes against the Union, he lost their confidence. His most intimate friends deserted a man, who was believed to have betray∣ed his party. He was openly accused of treachery and venality; and the reflections of others, combining, per∣haps, with his own regret, for having abandoned what fortune had placed in his hands, threw him into a violent illness, which threatened his dissolution<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot">Lockhart's Mem. Hooke's Negociations. Stuart-pa∣pers, 1707.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections</NOTE> Though the terms of the Union were by no means calculated to flatter the pride of the Scots, as an inde∣pendent people, no expedient could be deemed unfortu∣nate, that put an end to their own government, as it then stood. There were radical defects in the constitu∣tion of the kingdom, which in the best times and in the ablest hands, could not fail to be productive of perpetual evils to the nation. The estates of parliament, by meet∣ing in one house and voting promiscuously, in all debates, created a confusion and promoted a jarring of interests,
<PB N="332" REF="351"/>
more likely to embarrass than to transact the business of the public, with regularity and precision. The number of the peers, the poverty of that order, and their conse∣quent dependence on the crown, by carrying every vote in parliament, left the body of the people, in a manner, without a representative. The weight, which the pos∣session of England threw into the scale of the sovereign, had improved his authority, before the Revolution, into an almost uncontroulable tyranny. The crown was ab∣solute, though government was permitted to retain its ancient form. The blow, which the royal prerogative received in Scotland, in the memorable year 1688, esta∣blished licentiousness rather than freedom, in that king∣dom. The parliament were placed in a situation to make the most for themselves, at the hands of the King, while the people felt nothing from the alteration in government, but a change of tyrants.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">on the union</NOTE> Notwithstanding this untoward picture of the affairs of Scotland, the period of time between the Revolution and the passing of the act of union, produced men of eminent talents in that kingdom. The freedom of debate, which was introduced by the Revolution into parliament, fur∣nished many with the means of discovering their own parts; and animated them with an eagerness, which man∣kind mistook for public spirit. In an evil hour, for the nation, they were divided into many and irreconcilable factions; a circumstance hurtful in any country, but par∣ticularly ruinous, where the field of contest is too small. While they watched the motions of one another, the golden opportunity of mending their own constitution at home, or of incorporating themselves, upon honourable and advantageous terms, with England, was for ever lost. The peculiar situation of the latter kingdom had placed the fate of her monarchy, in some measure, in the hands of the Scots; and the latter could scarce be called unrea∣sonable, should they insist upon meeting their more pow∣erful neighbours upon a footing of greater equality. But in the animosity of parties, all regard for the public was lost; and a kind of mean selfishness, which scarce deserv∣ed to be dignified with the name of avarice, took pos∣session of every breast, and marked the age with indelible infamy.</P>
<P><PB N="333" REF="352"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace offer∣ed by France.</NOTE> While the great event of the union between the Bri∣tish kingdoms, was ready to secure the tranquillity of England at home, she preposterously rejected proposals for restoring, upon the most honourable terms for herself, the general peace of Europe. The French King, broken with the misfortunes of the campaign, on every side, be∣gan seriously to think of putting an end to a war, which had already fallen so heavy on his subjects, and even threatened the monarchy of France with danger, if not with dissolution. Having privately made some ineffectual applications of this kind to the States of the United Pro∣vinces, he resolved publickly to signify his earnest desire of peace; and he, for that purpose, ordered the Elector of Bavaria to write letters to the Duke of Marlborough and the field-deputies of the States, to propose the open∣ing of a general congress<NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">Oct. 21.</NOTE>. As a proof of his sincerity, he mentioned at once the terms. He offered the domi∣nions of Spain in Italy to the Arch-duke Charles, a bar∣rier in the Netherlands to the States, and a compensation to the Duke of Savoy, for the waste made by the war in his territories. In return, he expected, that the territo∣ries of Bavaria should be restored to their native Prince; and that his grandson Philip the Fifth, should sit on the throne of Spain and the Indies<NOTE N="L" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. iv. Life of Marlbo∣rough.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wantonly rejected by the allies.</NOTE> Though these terms were better than those afterwards obtained, considering the expence of treasure and blood, they were not likely to prove agreeable to those who led the counsels of the allies. The Duke of Marlborough was fond of the emoluments as well as of the glory of war. Prince Eugene, besides being actuated by similar motives, carried an irreconcilable aversion to France, in∣to all his views; and the pensionary Heinsius, who had the address to lead the counsels of the States, in acting in subserviency to the two generals, yielded to his own interest. These three distinguished persons, were the great springs that now moved the grand alliance. Besides, the people of England animated with the success of the war, were unwilling to put an end, by a peace, to the amusement arising from further victories. The Empe∣ror, having the good fortune to have HIS war supported
<PB N="334" REF="353"/>
by the benevolence and generosity of strangers, had re∣laxed his exertions to a degree that suited his conveni∣ence; and he was indifferent how long a contest, in which he might gain much and could lose nothing, might continue. The King of Portugal and the Duke of Savoy were so little considered, that they were not consulted; and, from all these various causes, Europe was destined to remain, for several years more, a scene of carnage, distress, and confusion. The Whigs, who were now possessed of the whole power of government in England, insulted common sense, in the reason which they gave for rejecting the proposed peace. They said, the terms offered by France were too good to be the foundation of a lasting tranquillity<NOTE N="M" PLACE="foot">Hannover-papers, 1707.</NOTE>; and therefore, that they ought not to be admitted.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 3. Parliament meets.</NOTE> In the attention paid by the people and ministry, to affairs beyond the limits of the kingdom, nothing memo∣rable could have happened at home. The parliament having met at Westminster, on the third of December, the commons proceeded, with such unanimity, to grant the supplies, that an ample provision was made, in the space of eighteen days, for the service of the succeeding year. Though the excluded party had neither forgotten their own misfortunes nor forgiven those in office, the splendour of victories abroad, and the reputation of their measures at home, had placed the ministry beyond the power of any successful attack. The church-party, therefore, prudently fell down with a stream which they could no longer oppose. The two houses, in congratu∣lating the Queen on the successes of the war, neglected not the Duke of Marlborough. They thanked him for his important services. As a more solid, and to the Duke a no less grateful mark of their esteem, they passed a bill to perpetuate his titles to his posterity, in the female as well as in the male line; and they continued to his family, for ever, the five thousand pounds a year, which the Queen had granted during her own life<NOTE N="N" PLACE="foot">Journals of both houses.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Union ap∣proved by both houses.</NOTE> With the same unanimity and zeal, the commons made provision for an extraordinary debt, to the amount of eight hundred thousand pounds, contracted by the

They provided, with the same alacrity, for the sum of three hundred and ninety∣eight thousand pounds, as an equivalent to Scotland, for paying, henceforth, the customs and excises, in the same proportion with England<NOTE N="O" PLACE="foot">March 13.</NOTE>. This sum, though per∣haps ill applied, was intended for the recoinage of the money of Scotland, to discharge the public debt, and to repay to the African company all their losses with interest. As the misfortunes of that wretched body of adventurers, were the source of the disturbances which subsisted among the Scots, for the last ten years, so the prospect of repayment was a great inducement to their reconcilement to the measure which annihilated their government. When the act of the Scotish parliament, confirming the treaty of union, was laid before the Eng∣lish commons, they passed it without opposition. In the house of lords, it furnished a subject for debate. But the minority was so insignificant, that the arguments against the treaty deserve not to be recorded<NOTE N="P" PLACE="foot">Journals, passim.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Parliament prorogued.</NOTE> The parliament having finished, with great temper, the important business of the session, were prorogued, on the twenty-fourth of April; and, five days after, the Queen signified by proclamation, that the first parlia∣ment of Great Britain should meet on the twenty-third of the next October. The union of the kingdoms being to commence on the first of May, that day was appointed for a public thanksgiving; and the Queen went, in state, to St. Paul's, a ceremony of which, to judge by its fre∣quency, she seemed to be extremely fond. But though the union of the kingdoms had now commenced in the eye of the law, it could scarce be considered as an entire and incorporating union. The privy-council of the king∣dom, the officers of state, and the whole ministry, were still maintained in Scotland. The servants of the crown, to retain their own authority, as well as to preserve their emoluments, persuaded the Queen that there was a ne∣cessity to preserve a shew of greatness and a form of go∣vernment at Edinburgh, to gratify the vanity of the vul∣gar,
<PB N="336" REF="355"/>
and to awe the Jacobites<NOTE N="Q" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. iv.</NOTE>. This doctrine con∣tinued to be inculcated on the government of England; and the Scots, instead of enjoying the benefit of a gene∣ral government, continued under the tyranny of a faction of their own countrymen.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Distress of France.</NOTE> The proposals of peace offered by France, having been rejected, with marks of disdain, by the allies, Lewis the Fourteenth found himself obliged to make all possible preparations for continuing, with some vigour, the war. The uncommon misfortunes of the last cam∣paign, had embarrassed his counsels, and thrown his king∣dom into the utmost distress and consternation. The only circumstance in which he could not blame his fortune, was, that a very favourable season had provided his peo∣ple with plenty of grain<NOTE N="R" PLACE="foot">Political annals, 1707</NOTE>. But he was in great want of money to pay his troops, as well as to provide his ar∣mies with those implements of war, which he had lost, on every side, to the enemy, in the preceding summer. To obtain a kind of remedy to this evil, he fell upon an expedient, which distressed the nation while it ruined the credit of government. In imitation of the exchequer-bills circulated by the government of England, he issued bills upon the mint, to the amount of seventy millions of livres<NOTE N="S" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. But, in refusing to take these bills in payment of the revenue, he threw them into such discredit, that after all expedients to raise their value had been tried, they remained at the discount of near sixty per cent.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Her prepa∣rations.</NOTE> Notwithstanding this domestic distress, Lewis contriv∣ed to make considerable preparations against the efforts of the enemy. He extended a line of militia along the coast of the ocean, and the shore of the Mediterranean. He formed an army in Flanders, under the Duke de Ven∣dôme. Another was assembled, by the Mareschal de Villars, in the neighbourhood of Strasbourg. A body of men was ordered to rendezvous in Navarre, another in Roussillon, and reinforcements were sent to the army commanded by the Duke of Berwick in Spain. The year began, with one instance of success on the part of France. Majorca was retaken by the Count de Villars, on the fifth of January. But this transitory gleam of
<PB N="337" REF="356"/>
good fortune was soon obscured, by fresh disasters in Italy. The French and Spanish troops were forced to evacuate Lombardy, by a capitulation signed on the thirteenth of March. Modena<NOTE N="T" PLACE="foot">Feb. 10.</NOTE> and Milan surrendered themselves successively to the allies. The whole kingdom of Naples was reduced, either by the treachery of the inhabitants or the force of the enemy; and the few places in the domi∣nions of Savoy and in the Milanese, that were still held by garrisons of French or Spaniards, fell, one by one, before the end of the campaign<NOTE N="U" PLACE="foot">Hist. de France, tom iii</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Almanza.</NOTE> The victory obtained at Almanza by the Duke of Ber∣wick, on the twenty-fifth of April, changed the whole face of affairs in Spain. The English and Portugueze being possessed, in the name of Charles the Third, of the kingdoms of Catalonia, Arragon, and Valencia, resolved under their generals, the Earl of Galway and the Mar∣quis Las-Minas, to penetrate into New-Castile. Having, for that purpose, passed the river Xucar, they advanced to Almanza. The Duke of Berwick, who had just ar∣rived at the place, hesitated not a moment to give them battle. The action extended from wing to wing. The English infantry penetrated the center of the enemy. But the Portugueze foot giving way, and Berwick's cavalry having, at the same time, thrown the horse of the allies in disorder, the battle was soon decided in favour of the French. Never victory was more complete. Six thou∣sand of the allies either lay dead on the field of battle, or were slain in the pursuit. Five general officers, seven brigadiers, twenty-five colonels, above eight hundred other officers, and nine thousand soldiers, were either taken prisoners, or, being surrounded in the mountains, were forced to surrender. All the cannon, standards, co∣lours, equipage, and baggage of the vanquished fell into the hands of the enemy. Las-Minas made his escape, with some cavalry, to Xativa. The Earl of Galway, with a party of horse, taking the rout towards Catalonia, stopt not his flight till he arrived at Tortosa, near the mouth of the Ebro. The Duke of Orleans, taking the command of the French army, the day after the battle, pursued the victory with great vigour. He took the city of Valencia, on the eighth of May; and the whole king∣dom

followed the fate of the capital. The victors direct∣ed their march to Arragon. Sarragossa<NOTE N="W" PLACE="foot">May 25.</NOTE>, and in ge∣neral all Arragon, were again reduced under the dominion of Philip the Fifth; while his rival either loitered in Catalonia, or made an ineffectual progress towards the frontiers of Roussillon<NOTE N="X" PLACE="foot">Hist, d'Espagne.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Campaign in Germa∣ny.</NOTE> On the side of Germany, the affairs of the confede∣rates wore the same gloomy aspect. The usual sluggish∣ness and backwardness of the Princes, almost subjected the empire to the same misfortunes from which it had been relieved by the battle of Blenheim. The continu∣ance of the rebellion in Hungary, combined with the habitual inactivity of the court of Vienna, had ren∣dered the efforts of the house of Austria extremely lan∣guid, on the Upper Rhine. The Margrave of Bareith, who succeeded to the command of the Imperialists, upon the death of the Prince of Baden, led an army, inconsi∣derable in point of numbers, and ill-provided with neces∣saries for the field. The French army, under the Ma∣reschal de Villars, having passed the Rhine at Strasbourg, forced the lines at Stolhoffen, laid the duchy of Wirtim∣berg under contribution, entered Swabia, and penetrated to the Danube. But when Villars was meditating mea∣sures which might change the whole face of the war, he was forced to weaken his army by great detachments into France itself, which was now attacked within its limits, by the allies. Towards the end of the campaign, the Elector of Hannover took the command of the army of the empire; and Count Mercy having surprised the Marquis de Vivant at Offembourg, the Mareschal de Villars was forced to abandon all his schemes, and to re∣pass the Rhine<NOTE N="Y" PLACE="foot">Hist. d'Al∣lemagne, tom. vii.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dictatorial behaviour of the King of Sweden.</NOTE> The invasion of the French was not the only evil which the Emperor and empire had now to fear. The King of Sweden, having remained, during the winter, in Saxony, found very plausible pretences for a quarrel with the court of Vienna. He complained of an insult com∣mitted by Count Zobor, chamberlain to his Imperial Majesty, on the Baron Stralenheim, the Swedish envoy. Though all reasonable satisfaction was given by the Em∣peror,
<PB N="339" REF="358"/>
the King of Sweden, with an obstinacy suitable to his character, increased his complaints and multiplied his demands. He peremptorily reuired, that five hundred Russians, to whom the court of Vienna had given refuge in the Austrian dominions, should be delivered into his hands. He insisted, that the Emperor should immediate∣ly decide the affair of the election of Lubec, in favour of the administrator of Holstein. That the Protestants of Silesia should be indulged with the free exercise of their religion, according to the treaty of Westphalia. That his Imperial Majesty should relinquish all pretensions to the quota, which the King of Sweden had neglected to furnish, according to the tenure by which he held his do∣minions in Germany; and that the whole Swedish army, in their return through Silesia and Poland, should be maintained at the charge of the court of Vienna<NOTE N="Z" PLACE="foot">Hist. de Suede, 1707.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He thrown wantonly the balance of Europe from his hands.</NOTE> The court of Vienna was, by no means in a condition to refuse these dictatorial terms. But the Queen of Eng∣land and the States were alarmed, lest the pride of the Emperor Joseph should overcome his attention to the in∣terest of the allies. Queen Anne, therefore, had deter∣mined, early in the season, to order the Duke of Marl∣borough to repair to Saxony, to sooth the King of Swe∣den, and to gain the ministers of that Prince. The Duke, no stranger himself to the power of money over mankind, consulted the Elector of Hannover<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Hannover-papers, 1707.</NOTE>, about the sums to be given, as annual pensions, to the Counts Piper and Hermelin, who conducted the counsels of Charles the Twelfth. The Elector advised, that two thousand pounds sterling should be secured for the first, and one thousand for the latter; and that one year's pension should be paid in advance<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. The Duke arriving at Alt-Ranstadt, where the King of Sweden held his head quarters, was received with a degree of politeness, considering the harsh and uncomplying character of that Prince. Whether Marlborough gained Piper and Hermelin, through the channel of their venality, is uncertain, as well as unim∣portant. His negociations, by the event, seem to have been crowned with the desired effect; though it is more likely, that the King of Sweden yielded more to his own
<PB N="340" REF="359"/>
resentment against the Czar, than to the influence of corrupted ministers. England and Holland having guaran∣teed the promises of the Emperor to the demands of Charles, that Prince, after having, for more than a year, kept the allies in suspence, and actually held the balance of Europe, threw the whole, at once, from his hands, and, repassing the Oder, entered Poland, in pursuit of fruitless victories<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">Hist. de Nord, tom. ii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Siege of Toulon.</NOTE> The most memorable event of the year was the siege of Toulon, and the miscarriage of the allies before that im∣portant place. The reduction of the Spanish dominions in Italy, and the capitulation signed at Milan in March, by which the French army abandoned that country, left the Duke of Savoy and Prince Eugene at freedom to carry the war into the enemy's country. In concert with England and Holland a project was formed, either to destroy or take Toulon and Marseilles; an enterprise, if crowned with success, which could not fail to be highly beneficial to the maritime powers, as well as of great im∣portance to the confederates in general. The Duke of Savoy and Prince Eugene, having, for some time, amused the French with marches and countermarches, turned suddenly toward the shore of the Mediterranean, forced the passage of the river Var, advanced along the coast of Provence, and, after a long march, through a hot, rugged, and inhospitable country, arrived before Toulon, on the twenty-sixth of July. Sir Cloudsley Shovel, with a strong squadron of men of war, attended the motions of the allies, supplied the army with necessaries, and block∣ed up the town by sea<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">Naval Hist. M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> Anecdotes.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deserted by the allies.</NOTE> Their want of intelligence, and the necessary delays in their march, disappointed the views of the allies upon the town. Two hours before Prince Eugene arrived, with the van, the French found means to throw eight thousand men into the place. The fortifications were repaired with incredible expedition. Troops were advantageously posted on the hills adjacent to the walls. The allies having taken the heights of St. Catherine, were driven from thence, on the fourteenth of August, with great slaughter. The number of troops in Toulon and in
<PB N="341" REF="360"/>
neighbourhood, the bad condition of the confederate ar∣my, and the intelligence received of the motions of the French, on every side, induced the generals to desist from their attempt. The Duke of Burgundy, with a consi∣derable force, was on his march to cut off their retreat from Nice. Of twelve thousand horse, scarce four thou∣sand were fit for service, in that rocky country, the iron for shoes expected from Genoa, having been detained by contrary winds. Had the confederates, therefore, re∣mained ten days longer before Toulon, they would, in all likelihood, have been obliged to surrender prisoners of war; such was their own weak condition and the activity used by the French to disappoint the design<NOTE N="E" PLACE="foot">MS. Anecdo tes.</NOTE>. Having bombarded the place, the fleet and army retired, in the night between the twenty-first and the twenty-second of August.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Inactive campaign in Flanders. Losses at sea.</NOTE> In Flanders nothing of importance happened during the campaign. The French, under the Duke de Vendôme, prudently avoided an action; and they managed their motions so well, that they furnished the enemy no oppor∣tunity of attacking them, with advantage. The princi∣pal operations at sea, were confined to the fruitless siege of Toulon. The Chevalier de Forbin had the good for∣tune of taking two English men of war, with twenty merchantmen; and what was still more fortunate for him∣self, to make his escape after an engagement with a su∣perior squadron. Some advantages were obtained by the English on the coast of North-America. But they sus∣tained a very great loss in the shipwreck of Sir Cloudsley Shovel. That admiral, on the twenty-ninth of Septem∣ber, sailed from Gibraltar, with a fleet of fifteen ships of the line and some frigates. Having arrived in the mouth of the channel, on the night of the twenty-second of Oc∣tober, by a mistake in his course, he steered directly on some dangerous rocks, to the westward of the islands of Scilly. The Association, the ship in which the admiral sailed, struck and foundered, at once, not one of the crew being saved. The same melancholy fate attended the Eagle and Romney; and of the sailors on board the Firebrand, another ship driven on the rocks, only twenty-four and the captain were saved<NOTE N="F" PLACE="foot">Naval Hist.</NOTE>. The fate of Shovel
<PB N="342" REF="361"/>
was lamented by all. He had raised himself, by his in∣dustry and merit, from a common sailor, to the head of the fleet. In his public conduct he was deemed brave, vigilant, and circumspect; and in his private capacity, he preserved the character of a modest and honest man.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections on the cam∣paign.</NOTE> The campaign of the year 1707, though in some de∣gree favourable to the house of Bourbon, scarce suspend∣ed their misfortunes. The conquest of Naples balanced the benefits derived from the victory obtained at Almanza; and the siege of Toulon, though unsuccessful on the part of the allies, was extremely detrimental to France. The enemy, in their march and retreat through Provence, ruined a great extent of country. The attempt defeated the projects of France on the side of Germany, by di∣viding her forces. Villars having penetrated to the Da∣nube, was forced to repass the Rhine; and to relinquish to an enemy, who could not meet him before in the field, all the advantages of a campaign, that seemed to threaten to change the whole face of affairs. A degree of morti∣fication was added to the misfortunes of the court of Ver∣sailles. The Duke of Savoy, whose capital was besieged by a French army, in the preceding campaign, was at the head of a powerful invasion in the dominions of France, in the present year. But the conduct of the court of France was now as feeble as her misfortunes were numerous. The Salique law seemed to have been made in vain, in a country destined to be governed and ruined by women. Madame de Maintenon, though advanced in years, maintained her influence over the su∣perannuated mind of the King. Flattery to an aged mistress, became a better title than merit, to the com∣mand of armies; and, thus, the folly of his own councils became as fatal to Lewis as the arms of the confederates.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="1707" UNIT="year"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Discontents in Scotland.</NOTE> THOUGH the Union of the two British kingdoms had been carried in their respective parliaments by a great majority, that measure was far from receiving the general sanction of the people. Men who were apt to urge speculative arguments against expediency, affirm∣ed, with a degree of justice, that no representative of a nation had a right to dissolve the constitution from which
<PB N="344" REF="363"/>
they derived their own political existence. The genera∣lity of the Scotish nation, either swayed by their pride, or yielding to their prejudices, were loud in their complaints; and wanted nothing but leaders to appeal from their par∣liament to the decision of the sword. The populace, in particular, were so eager to take up arms, that the nobi∣lity and chiefs were forced to avoid mixing with their vassals, for fear of being insulted for not leading them di∣rectly to the field<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Hooke's Negociations.</NOTE>. The minister of England, in the mean time, either from negligence or design<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1707.</NOTE>, had made no preparations against the sudden incursion of a people whom he knew to be inflamed to a degree of madness.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Intrigues of France.</NOTE> Happily for England, and, perhaps, ultimately for the Scots themselves, the court of France was still more des∣titute of counsels than of power. Instead of listening to the earnest solicitations of the malecontents, in sending the Pretender, with a force sufficient to protect his person, to Scotland, they dispatched colonel Hooke into that kingdom, with instructions more calculated to depress the spirits of the Jacobites, than to rouse them to arms. Hooke arriving soon after the recess of parliament, made a secret progress through the northern counties, and pre∣sented to the leaders of the Jacobites, letters from the King of France, as well as from the Pretender. The Dukes of Gordon and Athol, the Earls of Errol, Marishal, Panmure, and Strathmore, the Viscount Stormont, and in general, all the nobility and gentry to the North of the Forth, and many whose estates lay to the South of that river, received him with gladness, and expressed their readiness to take up arms for the exiled family. Their enthusiasm in favour of the Pretender and aversion to the Union were so great, that though it was apparent Hooke's object was to engage them in every thing, and the French King in nothing, they signed a general me∣morial, referring implicitly the expected aid from France to the generosity of Lewis the Fourteenth.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hooke's ne∣gociations.</NOTE> In this memorial, after a complimentary preamble to the French King, they signified their earnest desire that the Pretender should be immediately sent to Scotland. They affirmed that, upon his arrival, he should be re∣ceived

without opposition as king; and that the establish∣ed government would instantly vanish without making the least effort for its own support. Out of the great number of men that were to be led by his adherents to his standard, they proposed to select twenty-five thousand foot and five thousand horse. These they promised to clothe, to arm, and to provide with provisions till they should march into England. But, upon that event they insinuated, that a monthly subsidy ought to be paid by France, should the war be prolonged for any time, by the resistance of the English nation to the person whom the memorialists called their lawful King. They solemn∣ly assured the most Christian King, that the whole king∣dom, from an aversion to the Union, were unanimous in their wishes for the restoration of the exiled family; and that, as they threw themselves under his Majesty's pro∣tection, they were confident he would effectually support their cause. They, however, left the time, the man∣ner, and the strength to be sent, entirely to himself. The whole strain of the memorial was spiritless, though vehement. It expressed an enthusiasm for an immediate insurrection, which Lewis, had he been more attentive to his own interest, might have greatly improved to his advantage<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">Hooke's Negociations.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Conduct of the court of St. Ger∣mains.</NOTE> Together with this memorial, Hooke was charged with letters from the leaders of the malecontents to the Pretender and the French ministry. Having arrived in France, in the month of July, he laid the substance of his negociations before the court of Versailles. The Earl of Middleton, who managed the affairs of the Pre∣tender, attempted to add the weight of argument to the offers and solicitations of the Scots. He endeavoured to establish the probability of the success of an insurrection in Scotland, by the recent and still-existing resistance of the Hungarians against the forces and efforts of the court of Vienna. He mentioned, as an example of the same kind, the insurrection in the Cevennes, where a few peasants, without any succours from abroad, maintained themselves so long against regular troops, commanded by Mareschals of France. He averred, that nothing was so well calculated to terminate a war, as to carry it into the enemy's country. The King of Sweden, he said, after
<PB N="346" REF="365"/>
a series of victories, for five years, in Poland, found new enemies rising, as it were, from the blood of the slain, till, by making a sudden irruption into Saxony, he put, at once, an end to the war and the reign of King Augustus. He affirmed, that the enemies of France were convinced of the justness of these maxims; as appeared from their efforts in Spain, their attempts upon the Moselle, their project of a descent on the coast of the ocean, and the present invasion of the Duke of Savoy along the shore of the Mediterranean<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">Middleton to M. de Chamillart. MS.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Secret views of the Earl of Godol∣phin.</NOTE> The representations of Hooke, the arguments of Mid∣dleton, and the repeated and vehement solicitations of the Scots themselves, were lost on the court of Versailles. Happily for Great Britain, the measures of the French ministry were too much disconcerted with an invasion of their own country, to think of carrying the war into that of the enemy. The sullen silence which arose in Scot∣land, from the anxious expectations of the discontented, was, in the mean time, mistaken by the superficial for an acquiescence in the Union between the kingdoms. The affairs of England, in like manner, wore the face of tranquillity. The attention of the people being turned to the operations of the war, the bickerings between par∣ties were either forgot or neglected. But to those, who from judicious observations on the past, could penetrate into the future, a storm seemed to be gathering behind the transient sun-shine, which, to use a metaphor, en∣lightened at present the kingdom. The lord-treasurer thinking, perhaps, that he had gone too far, in opposi∣tion to his principles, in accomplishing the Union, seem∣ed, from his conduct, little anxious about its continuance. Every measure calculated to exasperate the Scots against that treaty was adopted. Though the revenue of Scot∣land had fallen under the management of the treasury in England, on the first of May, no care had been taken to issue commissions for new officers.</P>

These mea∣sures, calculated to irritate the Scotish nation against the English, were accompanied with an internal relaxation of government, which raised a suspicion, that the mi∣nister, if not the Court, was in the interest of the ex∣iled family. The correspondence maintained between France and Scotland was no secret. But it passed with∣out animadversion; and no notice was taken of public rejoicings celebrated at Edinburgh, and other parts of Scotland, on the birth-day of the Pretender. The Scots considering all government in a manner dissolved, by what they called the illegality of the Union, were at no pains to conceal their sentiments; yet such was the su∣pineness of the minister, that he seemed to court an in∣surrection, and even an invasion<NOTE N="F" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Marlbo∣rough's se∣cret in∣trigues.</NOTE> During this suspicious conduct of Godolphin, he and the Duke of Marlborough continued to make their usual assurances of fidelity and attachment to the court of St. Germains<NOTE N="G" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1707.</NOTE>. The Duke, in particular, seemed to in∣sinuate to their agents, that one cause of rejecting the proposals of peace offered by France, was their not com∣prehending any stipulations in favour of the exiled fami∣ly<NOTE N="H" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, April 1707.</NOTE>. The conduct of Marlborough with regard to that unfortunate race is unaccountable, except on the footing of principle. Neglected by the French and with∣out resources themselves, they were scarce worthy of being deceived, should they even have the weakness to place any confidence in promises so often and so ineffec∣tually made. Had their conviction of Marlborough's sincerity been equal to the opinion which the world had formed of his power, they might, at least, suppose, that their own misfortunes were drawing to an end. The Queen was in the possession of his Dutchess. The affairs of the nation were either in the hands of his friends or in his own. The lord-treasurer, who guided the whole line of internal business, was inseperably connected with the fortune of his family. The Earl of Sunderland, his son-in-law, as secretary of state, was possessed of the secrets of the kingdom; and either the splendour of his
<PB N="348" REF="367"/>
own actions, or the art of his conduct, had rendered parliament, in a manner, subservient to his views.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Intrigues in the cabinet.</NOTE> Notwithstanding this appearance of firmness in the fabric reared by Marlborough, it was secretly under∣mined in a manner that threatened its fall. The Whigs, either suspecting the principles of Godolphin, or, what is more probable, from views upon his office and influ∣ence, were preparing to attack his measures in parlia∣ment<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot">Duke of Hamilton to the Pretender. May 1707.</NOTE>. They were no strangers to his political cow∣ardice; and they were determined to derive some advan∣tage to themselves from his weakness. But when prepa∣rations were making against him without, he was privately attacked within the cabinet. A new female favourite had, in a great measure, supplanted the Duchess of Marlborough in the affections of the Queen, or rather in the dominion which she had established over the mind of that timid and easy princess. Mr. Harley, who had been secretary of state for some years, had gained a con∣siderable degree of credit with the Queen. To strength∣en his own interest, he secured the confidence and assist∣ance of the new favourite. The great weight, and the almost irresistible power which Marlborough and the connexions of his family had established, could not have failed to raise, in some degree, the jealousy of the Queen, who was actually a mere cypher in their hands. She, therefore, listened to the suggestions of Harley; who, presuming on the manifest change in the mind of the sovereign, began to act no longer in dependence on the minister<NOTE N="J" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. iv.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Opposition formed.</NOTE> While Harley employed his intrigues in the closet against Marlborough and Godolphin, a formidable op∣position to their measures was preparing against the meet∣ing of parliament. As long as the people were amused with splendid victories abroad, they complained not of the burden of the war at home. But when the progress of conquest was stopt, by the misfortune at Almanza and the raising of the siege of Toulon, a general inclination for peace appeared in the nation. The Whigs, offended in the person of one of their leaders, encouraged this pa∣cific disposition among the people. The Lord Wharton,
<PB N="349" REF="368"/>
forgetting the animosity between the Whigs and the To∣ries in his own resentment against the ministry, had paid a visit to the Earl of Nottingham, with propositions to join the high-church party to humble Marlborough and Godolphin. The latter noblemen, from views of their own, were highly averse to pacific measures. But the current ran violently against the war, till Marlborough returned to the kingdom. The chief reason opposed by the Duke to a peace, was that France, presuming on her success at Almanza, had receded from the terms which she had offered the preceding year. He pretend∣ed, that Lewis the Fourteenth had then promised to re∣store Spain and the Indies. The recovery of the whole Spanish monarchy out of the hands of the house of Bour∣bon, he knew, had been the chief object of the English nation in their warm prosecution of the war, from the hopes that they had conceived of the great mercantile ad∣vantages resulting from a treaty already concluded with the house of Austria. The Duke insinuated, that to ob∣tain that great object, there was a necessity for continu∣ing the war; and this argument, though founded on a misrepresentation of the fact, had great weight with the trading part of the nation.<NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers. Hook's Negociations.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">First parlia∣ment of Great-Bri∣tain.</NOTE> During these intrigues, on both sides, the first parlia∣ment of Great Britain met at Westminster. The Queen coming to the house of peers, on the twenty-third of Oc∣tober, directed the commons to chuse a Speaker. Many considered this ceremony unnecessary, as the parliament had not been dissolved, but dropt and afterwards renew∣ed by proclamation, in terms of an act for that purpose. All disputes concerning the legality of the election of a speaker were prevented by Smith's being again placed in the chair. On the sixth of November, the Queen, as usual, made a speech from the throne. To a brief detail of the state of affairs abroad, she annexed the customary demand of supplies, and concluded with exhortations to affection toward her own person and government, and unanimity among themselves. The commons having ap∣proved of the Queen's speech, voted an address of thanks, on the tenth of November. The house of peers, how∣ever,
<PB N="350" REF="369"/>
were not equally complaisant. The discontents of some disappointed lords, joined several votes to the stand∣ing party against Marlborough and Godolphin. When an address to the throne was moved, a motion for consider∣ing first the state of the nation was carried. A zeal for the redress of public evils arose, in proportion to the height of private resentment. Whigs and Tories were promis∣cuously in opposition. The leaders of the first had been too much neglected in the distribution of places. The latter had neither forgot nor forgiven the means that had been used to deprive them of power<NOTE N="L" PLACE="foot">MS. of the Times.</NOTE></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Great oppo∣sition in the house of lords.</NOTE> Though many followed the bent of their own passions in the opposition with which the session was opened in the house of lords, it must be confessed that there was mat∣ter of just complaint. The Duke of Marlborough, with all his abilities and success in the field, suffered acts of meanness, selfishness, and avarice to stain the fame, which he had acquired in the world. The Earl of Go∣dolphin, though a man of abilities, carried the indolence, ill-temper, and peevishness of his private character into his public conduct. The reputation which both had ac∣quired, with a degree of justice, in their respective de∣partments, had a visible effect on their own minds. The self-sufficiency which is seldom separated from success, had rendered them negligent of men who possessed abili∣ties to support their measures in parliament. Instead of permitting the places and emoluments of government to run in the channel of parliamentary interest, they grati∣fied their own friends and dependents, and thus by exclud∣ing the ambitious from office, they furnished them with leisure as well as with resentment to oppose their own measures.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Inquiry into mismanage∣ments in the admiralty.</NOTE> The lords resolving themselves into a committee of their whole house, to consider of the state of the nation, a petition was presented, in the name of more than two hundred merchants of London, complaining of great losses at sea, for want of cruizers and convoys. In the prosecution of the inquiry great abuses were discovered in the department of the admiralty, which was managed by a council, in the name of the Prince of Denmark, who bore the name but not the power of lord admiral. The committee having made a very unfavourable report
<PB N="351" REF="370"/>
to the house it was transmitted to the Prince of Denmark. An answer was returned in his name, which attempted to justify the several charges contained in the report. But the most remarkable part of the paper was its conclusion, which contained very severe strictures on the management of sea affairs in the late reign. In the war carried on by King William it appeared, that four thousand merchant∣men had been taken by the enemy; which at a medium fell little short of five hundred ships every year. The truth is, that during the two reigns which immediately succeeded the Revolution, naval affairs were much ne∣glected. Great fleets were equipped to second the ope∣rations by land, while the trade of the nation was left a prey to flying squadrons and privateers<NOTE N="M" PLACE="foot">Journals of the lords.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in Spain ex∣amined.</NOTE> Though the Prince of Denmark was neither blamed in the debates, nor mentioned in the report of the com∣mittee, the Queen was highly offended. She, however, made a general answer to the address of the lords, and promised to protect the trade of her subjects. The in∣quiry into the state of naval affairs, was succeeded by an examination into the military operations in Spain; where the first success of the English nation had terminated in loss and disgrace. The Earl of Peterborough, who had performed signal services in that kingdom, had been re-called in the preceding August. The Tories, in oppo∣sition to the Earl of Galway, magnified the merit of Pe∣terborough; while the Whigs made severe remarks on his conduct. A written complaint against Peterborough, had been transmitted by King Charles to England. The paper was laid before the two houses. But Peterbo∣rough, in his own justification, produced such a number of witnesses and papers, that the parliament, aster spend∣ing two weeks on the subject, were so much tired of Spa∣nish affairs and the Earl, that they dropt both, without any animadversion<NOTE N="N" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>

To abate the resentment of the Scots

They, however, intro∣duced a bill for repealing the famous act of security, with had so much inflamed the Scots and alarmed the English nation. In considering that part of her Majes∣ty's speech, which required the parliament to make the Union more complete, they came to several important resolves. They voted, that there should be but one pri∣vy council in Great Britain. That the militia of Scot∣land should be placed on the same footing with that of England. That the powers of justices of the peace should be the same throughout the united kingdom. That, for the better and more expeditious administration of justice, the lords of justiciary should go circuits, twice a year; and that the writs for electing members to serve in parliament for Scotland, should be returned in the same manner as in England.<NOTE N="Q" PLACE="foot">Dec. 11.</NOTE>. A bill brought in up∣on these resolutions, passed, with little difficulty, the two houses.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An univer∣sal zeal for continuing the war.</NOTE> During these proceedings, the warmest and most uni∣versal zeal for carrying on the war, with the utmost vi∣gour, was exhibited by the two houses. The lords re∣solved that no peace could be safe or honourable, for her Majesty or for the allies, should Spain and the West In∣dies remain in the power of the house of Bourbon. The commons, having concurred with the lords in an address containing this resolution, the two houses presented the same, in a body, on the twenty-third of December<NOTE N="R" PLACE="foot">Dec. 23.</NOTE>. The Queen, in her answer, assured her parliament, that she was fully of opinion, that no peace could either be sase or honourable, till the entire monarchy of Spain should be restored to the house of Austria. She, at the same time, promised, in compliance with the other arti∣cles of their address, to continue her most pressing instan∣ces to the Emperor, to hasten further succours for Spain, under the command of the Prince of Savoy. The court of Vienna, however, were not equally sanguine with their very generous allies, in their own cause. The in¦stances,
<PB N="353" REF="372"/>
if made, were ineffectual. The languor and undecisive measures of Germany continued. England, with the true spirit of knight-errantry, squandered her blood and exhausted her treasures, in prosecuting a war from which, it was not even pretended, she was to derive either territory or power.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Intrigues of Harley.</NOTE> Though this vehemence for continuing the war with such vigour, was highly suitable to the inclinations of the Duke of Marlborough, and consequently to those of the Earl of Godolphin, they still found themselves uneasy in their departments. The intrigues of Harley, in conjunc∣tion with Mrs. Masham, the new favourite, had already disturbed their counsels in the cabinet. The effects of this secret influence had even extended themselves to the two houses of parliament<NOTE N="S" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. iv. Dutchess of Marlborough's con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>.</NOTE>. Harley, who, perhaps, was not entirely ignorant of the attachment of Marlbo∣rough and Godolphin to the exiled family, found means to raise the jealousy of the Whigs, while, at the same time, he was said to have contrived to foment the bad humour of the Tories against the management of public affairs. An accident, however, furnished the enemies of Harley with an opportunity of revenge. The Mares∣chal de Tallard, still a prisoner in England, wrote fre∣quently to Chamillart, one of the ministers of Lewis the Fourteenth. But he sent his letters to the secretary's of∣fice, where they were perused and sealed. Harley, ig∣norant himself of the French language<NOTE N="T" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers. Hannover-papers, MSS. passim.</NOTE>, was obliged to trust the perusal of Tallard's letters to one Greg, a clerk in his office. Greg, being an abandoned and pro∣fligate fellow, hoped to derive advantage from this cir∣cumstance. He inclosed, in a letter from the Mareschal, one from himself, offering his own services. He pro∣mised, for a valuable consideration, to betray his country to the court of France; and, as a specimen of his abilities to discharge his engagements, wrote an account of some important transactions. This letter was intercepted in Flanders, and sent back to London. Greg was seized, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ied, and condemned. <NOTE PLACE="marg">1708.</NOTE> Though Harley could not possi∣bly be supposed to know any thing of the matter, his re∣putation, through the art of his opponents, suffered con∣siderably,

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He is dis∣missed from office.</NOTE> This circumstance might have shaken the credit of Harley with the nation. He still retained his influence with the Queen. The principles avowed publickly by the Tories, being most agreeable to all sovereigns, Anne seems to have entertained an affection for that party, when even she excluded them from office. Marlborough and Godolphin, as far as they were swayed by principle, were in the interest of the excluded family. But they had employed the Whigs, as more active and better ac∣quantined with business<NOTE N="W" PLACE="foot">MS. anecdote</NOTE> than the Tories. They had always found the latter as unsteady in their conduct, as they were violent in their schemes. Harley, though bred a dissenter, and having all along avowed whiggish principles, sacrificed his opinions to his love of power; and, by flattering the prejudices of the Queen, in favour of the excluded party, hoped to govern the nation through their support and assistance. But though he was possessed of courage to undertake the administration of affairs on these terms, the times were not yet ripe for so precipitate a change. The Duke of Marlborough and the Earl of Godolphin complained of Harley's intrigues to the Queen. But that Princess heard them without be∣ing moved. They resolved, therefore, to extort from her fears what they could not derive from her prudence. They threatened both to resign their places; and the dis∣mission of Harley from the office of secretary of state<NOTE N="X" PLACE="foot">Feb. 11, 1708.</NOTE>, was preferred by the Queen, as the least evil. Sir Si∣mon Harcourt, the attorney-general, Henry St. John, secretary at war, and Mansel, comptroller of the house∣hold, chose to follow Harley's fortune, and resigned, at the same time, their places<NOTE N="Y" PLACE="foot">Feb. 12, 1708.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Opposition in parlia∣ment.</NOTE> Neither Harley nor the associates of his fortune, were likely to sit down quietly in their present state of disgrace. They had been, from the beginning of the session, at the bottom of the inquiries made in both houses, into the conduct of the war; and now they had added resentment to what formerly was only ambition. On the third of February, the commons had addressed the Queen, de∣manding
<PB N="355" REF="374"/>
to be informed, why a greater number of Eng∣lish forces had not been in Spain and Portugal, at the time of the battle of Almanza? The answer of the Queen was delayed to the eighteenth; and when it was received, it was deemed unsatisfactory. The lords continuing their inquiries into the state of naval affairs, presented a long address against the mismanagements in that department. Upon the whole, the complexion of both houses seemed greatly altered with regard to the ministry. The weight of government had secured, hitherto, a majority, upon the most trying questions, in the house of commons. But the Tories, in conjunction with the disappointed part of the Whigs, contrived to carry motions in the house of lords, highly disagreeable to those who had the chief management of public affairs<NOTE N="Z" PLACE="foot">Journals.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An invasion threatened from France.</NOTE> A sudden alarm from abroad, by terrifying at once the sovereign and the people, strengthened the hands of the ministry, and disappointed the views of the discontented. The court of France had almost always been averse to an invasion of Great Britain, and particularly in the preced∣ing summer. They, however, suffered themselves, in appearance, to be reconciled, in the winter, to that measure, through the vehement solicitations of the Scots, and the pressing instances of the excluded family. A squadron of small men of war, consisting of five ships equipped for action, and two fitted for transports, together with twenty-one frigates, were prepared at Dunkirk, while several battalions were ordered to march to that place, from the garrisons of Calais, St. Omers, Bergues, Aire, and Lisle<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Hooke's negociations.</NOTE>. The preparations were carried on with expedition and secresy; and when they came first to be known, it was uncertain where the storm was to fall. Men could scarce believe, that an invasion of Great Bri∣tain was seriously meant by the enemy, without a fleet of capital ships; and, therefore, the States of the United Provinces began to be extremely apprehensive of a descent on the coast of Zealand<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">Pub∣lic intelligence.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Preparati∣ons in Great Britain.</NOTE> General Cadogan, who resided at the Hague, in qua∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ty of ambassador from the court of Great Britain, ob∣tained the first intelligence of the real destination of the

armament preparing at Dunkirk. The information given by Cadogan, to the ministry, was confirmed by the news of the arrival of the pretended Prince of Wales at Dun∣kirk, in the end of the month of February. Boyle, who had succeeded Harley as secretary of state, communicated his intelligence, by the command of the Queen, to the house of commons, on the fourth of March<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">Journals, March 4.</NOTE>. The two houses, as upon all occasions of danger, joined in the usual address of lives and fortunes; and the commons, to strengthen the hands of government, introduced a bill for suspending the act of <HI>habeas corpus.</HI> The preparati∣ons of the ministry kept pace with the zeal of parliament. Sir George Byng, with a squadron of twenty-three ships of war, had already stretched over to Dunkirk. Ten battalions of English troops were ordered from Flanders. The forces in England were every where in motion; and the regiments quartered in the south of Ireland were or∣dered to march towards the north, for the convenience of a short passage to Scotland, where the French had form∣ed a design to land<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">Hist. of Europe, 1708.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">French sail from Dun∣kirk.</NOTE> The fleet, under Byng, having been driven back by strong winds, to the Downs, the French squadron sailed from Dunkirk, on the sixth of March. To deceive the British admiral, should he return to his station, they had placed an equal number of vessels in the road. The squadron was commanded by M. de Fourbin. The Pre∣tender, under the name of Chevalier de St. George, was on board, with five thousand one hundred soldiers, with ten thousand muskets, one thousand pistols, and as many carabines. The weather becoming calm, the squadron was forced to come to an anchor before Newport. Du∣ring two days of bad weather, which detained them in that place, three frigates having made signals of distress, bore away for Dunkirk, having eight hundred land forces on board. Weakened by this desertion, the admiral called a council of war, to consider whether they should continue their voyage to Scotland. The Chevalier him∣self decided in the affirmative. They accordingly sailed, in the night of the eighth of March, with a brisk and fa∣vourable gale. On the twelfth, they discovered the coas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Scotland. But either through the ignorance of thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They re∣turn.</NOTE> On the same day that the French fleet sailed from Dun∣kirk, Sir George Byng, whose squadron, by the incredible diligence of the admiralty, had been now augmented to forty capital ships, besides frigates, weighed anchor in the Downs, and stretched over towards Dunkirk. Being informed of the sailing of the enemy, by a boat from Ostend, he crowded after them with all his sails, and came in sight of the French with his van, on the morn∣ing of the thirteenth of March. M. de Fourbin took advantage of the wind and put to sea. In the afternoon of the same day, some of the enemy's ships came up with the Auguste, a French man of war, and a kind of run∣ning fight began. The Chevalier de St. George, during this action, entreated Fourbin, with the utmost earnest∣ness to put him on shore; being resolved, he said, to re∣main in Scotland, should none follow him but his own domestics<NOTE N="F" PLACE="foot">M. d'Andrezel's account to the French ministry, April 7, N. S. 1708.</NOTE>. Fourbin, having long argued in vain against the propriety of that measure, positively refused, at last, to agree to his request. The French, in the mean time, were dispersed, in their confused flight. The Salis∣bury, a vessel some time before taken from the English, was the only ship that fell into the hands of Byng. The rest having suffered much hardship at sea, and lost many of their men by sickness, returned, ship by ship, to Dunkirk<NOTE N="G" PLACE="foot">Hooke's negociations.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Observati∣ons.</NOTE> Though the armament for the invasion of Scotland seems rather to have been extorted from Lewis the Fourteenth, by the solicitations of the malecontents, than intended for a serious diversion to the British arms, there is reason to believe, that the failure of the scheme, before any landing was made, proved of the utmost im∣portance to the safety of government, as it then stood. The state of Scotland was, in every respect, favourable to, at least, the temporary success of the design. The
<PB N="358" REF="377"/>
most of the nobles, four-fifths of the gentry, and, per∣haps, a greater proportion of the common people, were inflamed into a degree of despair, at what they deemed the indignity of the terms of Union between the two kingdoms. The injudicious violence with which the new laws for collecting the revenue were introduced in∣to Scotland, bore the appearance of a design in the mi∣nister to rouse the inhabitants to some desperate attempt, to break a treaty, which he himself had accomplished with such appearance of zeal. Swarms of surveyors, collectors, and other officers, were sent from England. These executed the new regulations, with a rigour more suitable to the indignities that accompany conquest, than to the rights of a free people. The friends of the excluded family fomented, with success, the public resentment against the English government. Many, formerly averse to the restoration of the Stuarts, now desired it with the utmost vehemence, as the only means to avoid a yoke, which they deemed the more grievous and insupportable, that it was unexpected and new<NOTE N="H" PLACE="foot">State of Scotland, MS.</NOTE>.</P>

Stuart-papers.</NOTE>, had, at the same time, left the kingdom in a defenceless condition. The castles and forts were in a ruinous situation, and destitute of military stores. There were only two thousand five hundred regular troops in Scotland, and these were known to be disaffected. The money for the equivalent was, at the same time, in the castle of Edinburgh. That fortress was not in a state to defeat the slightest effort of an enemy<NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">Hooke's Negociations.</NOTE>. A Dutch fleet had just run a-ground, on the coast of the county of Angus, with ammunition, cannon, muskets, and money. The act of security had placed arms in the hands of the lower sort of people, of which they had not yet been deprived, by the repeal of that law. The High∣landers, though from the situation of their country, and the state of society established among the clans, they felt not the supposed grievances of the Union, were, from a national pride, attached to a race of Princes, whom they deemed their countrymen. The officers of government in Scotland, were so sensible of the untenable condition
<PB N="359" REF="378"/>
of that country, that they had already made preparations for taking refuge in the town of Berwick. The imme∣diate submission of the whole kingdom, and a general acknowledgment of his authority would, therefore, have been the infallible consequence of the Pretender's landing with the appearance of a regular force<NOTE N="L" PLACE="foot">Hooke's Negociations.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Views of the Scotish Jacobites.</NOTE> The discontented Scots had formed a resolution of invading England, as soon as their own country should submit itself to the authority of the person whom they called their lawful King. They proposed, with seven∣teen thousand foot and three thousand horse of their own nation, in conjunction with their French auxiliaries, to distress London, by the immediate seizure of Newcastle, and by stopping the coal-trade. The regular force to the south of the Tweed was incapable of meeting the Scots in the field. In Flanders there were only eighteen British regiments, and one third of these were their coun∣trymen. The latter, instead of opposing their projects, would, they hoped, join and forward their views. They knew, that, without the consent of parliament, the Queen could not call<NOTE N="M" PLACE="foot">Ibid. Stuart papers, passim.</NOTE> any foreign troops to her aid. Besides, they derived expectations from negociation as well as from force. The dissolution of the Union, the repeal of the act of settlement, the present possession of Scotland, the eventual succession of England to her bro∣ther, they hoped to derive all from the fears, and, per∣haps, from the affection of the Queen. Should matters come to extremity, they knew, that Marlborough would, in all likelihood, have the chief command. They hoped, that such a favourable opportunity would induce that nobleman to perform his promises and oaths to the ex∣cluded family<NOTE N="N" PLACE="foot">Stuart papers, passim.</NOTE>. They built much on the attachment of the Tories, the confusion of the Whigs, the total breach in public credit, the terrors of the affluent, the ex∣pectations of the needy, and the love of novelty in all.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Observati∣ons.</NOTE> Wild as these expectations of the Scotish Jacobites may now appear, they were deemed by no means extra∣vagant in the eyes of men acquainted with the state of the kingdom and the disposition of the times. The pro∣ject seemed so practicable to the Duke of Marlborough,
<PB N="360" REF="379"/>
that he chided the court of St. Germains, for not having previously informed him of their design<NOTE N="O" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, May, 1708.</NOTE>. The Queen and her minister, the Earl of Godolphin, were guided by passions, that favoured the most sanguine hopes of the adherents of the excluded line. They were both sub∣ject to political terror, both attached to the eventual suc∣cession of the Pretender; and there is scarce any reason to doubt, but they would both agree, with great readi∣ness, to any proposals to secure the reversion of the crown of England to the ancient line<NOTE N="P" PLACE="foot">Reflections. Stu∣art-papers, MS.</NOTE>. Happily for the kingdom, the retreat of the French put an end to the fears of the people, and prevented, perhaps, the horrors of a civil war. Some mischief, however, was effected in Britain, by this impotent attempt on the part of France. A violent run upon the bank, threatened the ruin of pub∣lic credit; and though the treasury and some nobleman of wealth tendered their assistance, the evil only ceased with the terrors of the nation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Parliament dissolved.</NOTE> The two houses continued sitting, during the alarm of the invasion. But nothing important was transacted after the money-bills had passed, for the service of the ap∣proaching campaign. On the thirteenth of April, the parliament was prorogued, and, two days after, dissolved by proclamation. The messengers of government were, in the mean time, employed in taking into custody the lords and gentlemen, in Scotland, who were most sus∣pected of having invited the French to invade the king∣dom. Though all who were seized, were deeply con∣cerned in the conspiracy against government, proofs could be carried home to none. The most of the prisoners were, therefore, dismissed upon bail. A prudent lenity was even observed toward persons already legally con∣victed of treason. In the Salisbury, the only ship which had fallen into the hands of the British fleet, the Lord Griffin, who had followed the late King James to France, was taken, and received sentence of death on a former outlawry. His great age induced the Queen to reprieve him, from time to time, till a natural death, by pre∣venting the hand of public justice, put an end to his mis∣fortunes and his fears.</P>
<P><PB N="361" REF="380"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Campaign in Flanders.</NOTE> During these transactions in England, preparations were made abroad, for opening, with vigour, the cam∣paign. The Duke of Marlborough, having left London on the twenty-ninth of March, arrived the next evening at the Hague, where he was met by Prince Eugene of Savoy. These two generals, having settled with the States the operations of the summer, repaired by differ∣ent roads, to Hannover, to reconcile the Elector to the regulations which they had settled, without his commu∣nication, with regard to the army which his Highness commanded, in the close of the preceding year, on the Upper-Rhine. The Duke of Marlborough, having placed himself at the head of the confederates, in the neighbourhood of Ghent, in the end of May, the French took the field on that side, with an army superior to the allies, in point of number. They were commanded, in the name of the Duke of Burgundy, by the Duke de Vendôme. Though they were possessed of strength suf∣ficient to cope with the enemy in the field, they chose rather to rely on stratagem and surprise, than on the more uncertain success of open force. The Elector of Bavaria, during his long government in Flanders, had gained an influence among the Flemings, which he re∣tained, after the greatest part of the country had been lost to the allies, in the fatal battle of Ramillies. He either obtained, by his intrigues, or purchased with the money of France, an absolute promise from the magis∣trates of the cities of Ghent, Antwerp, and Bruges to open their gates to the troops of the house of Bourbon. The extortions of the allies, of which neither Marlbo∣rough nor his friend Cadogan had been unconcerned spectators<NOTE N="Q" PLACE="foot">Mem. of the Generality of Ghent, MS.</NOTE>, contributed to this projected revolt, as much as the intrigues of the Elector of Bavaria.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Oudenarde.</NOTE> The two armies having remained in their respective camps the whole month of June, a body of French troops were received, into the city of Ghent, under the appearance of a surprise, on the fifth of July. Bruges surrendered itself, the next day, in like manner, to ano∣ther detachment of the same army. The Duke of Marl∣borough, accused, perhaps very unjustly, of being privy to the treachery, from interested views, was incapable of preventing its effects. Though much inferior in force to
<PB N="362" REF="381"/>
the enemy, he offered them battle; which they avoided, by passing the Dender in the night<NOTE N="R" PLACE="foot">July 6.</NOTE>. The opportu∣nity, which the French generals now denied to the ene∣my, was soon offered by their own disputes. Returning from the Dender, they directed their march to the Scheld. But the Duke of Marlborough, who had been joined by Prince Eugene, had already passed that river, and lay between the French and their lines. The enemy could no longer decline battle. The Scheld, with seve∣ral inclosures, covered their left. A morass ran along their front; and, on a rising ground on their right they placed their cavalry, interlined with bodies of foot<NOTE N="S" PLACE="foot">Mem. du Marq. de Feuquiere.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">French par∣tially de∣feated.</NOTE> The infantry of the allies advancing across the morass, were received with great resolution and spirit by the ene∣my. But the British cavalry broke those of the French at the first shock; while the foot intermixed with the squadrons were cut to pieces on the plain. The infan∣try behind the morass stood their ground for some time, against all the efforts of the allies. To avoid, however, being flanked by the British horse, who were now victo∣rious, they sheltered themselves in the inclosures on the banks of the Scheld. The battle, however, was by no means decisive. But the fears and bad conduct of the French, yielded to the allies all the consequences of a compleat victory. No baggage, no cannon were lost. It was the repulse of a party, rather than a general rout. The allies expected nothing but the renewal of battle upon better terms the next morning. But the French retreated through five different routes in the night. The general confusion and panic which prevailed in this dis∣graceful and disorderly retreat, by breaking the spirits of the soldiers, disconcerted all the measures of the French generals for the rest of the campaign<NOTE N="T" PLACE="foot">French Writers, passim.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their re∣treat, and the siege of Lisle.</NOTE> Discomfited in their own minds, the French, instead of retrieving the honour which they had lost, plunged themselves deeper in disgrace and misfortune. They retired from Ghent under Tournay and under Ypres. They permitted Prince Eugene, whose reinforcement of Germans from the Moselle was now arrived, to form the siege of Lisle. That city, fortified with all the art of
<PB N="363" REF="382"/>
Vauban, was considered as the key to France itself, on that side, The Mareschal de Boufflers defended in per∣sons, with a numerous garrison, the capital of his own government. The particulars of sieges are not interest∣ing at any considerable distance of time. The Duke of Vendôme attempted, in vain, to relieve the place, by endeavouring to cut off the convoys of the enemy from beyond the Scheld and from Ostend. In attacking a party of English at Winnendal, a French detachment was defeated with the loss of their cannon and all their implements of war. In attempting to attack the enemy before Lisle, though joined by the Duke of Berwick with a great reinforcement, Vendôme was twice disap∣pointed, after a fruitless cannonade. The city, in the mean time, was gallantly defended by the Mareschal de Boufflers. After a siege of three months, it was, how∣ever, forced to surrender<NOTE N="U" PLACE="foot">Oct. 23.</NOTE>. Boufflers retired, with the remains of the garrison, into the citadel, which he held till the eighth of December.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Observati∣ons.</NOTE> No fortified place was ever more vigorously attacked, none more gallantly defended, than the important town of Lisle. The besiegers carried no part of the works with∣out a regular and obstinate battle; and they were scarce masters of one place, when they were driven from ano∣ther, and put in danger of being forced to yield the ad∣vantages, which they had gained with so much valour and blood. But the difficulties of the allies were not ended with the conquest of Lisle. They had lost be∣tween eighteen and twenty thousand men before the place, which had rendered their army much inferior to the French. They were, at the same time, under the necessity of repassing the Scheld, or to distribute the troops in winter-quarters in the small space of country comprehended between Lisle, Menin, and Courtray. To pass a river whose banks were occupied by an enemy superior in number was dangerous as well as difficult. To remain in the neighbourhood of Lisle for the win∣ter, would have been to abandon the rest of Flanders, the province of Brabant, Guelderland, and a part of the territories of the States, to the mercy of the French. The Duke of Marlborough, who always treated fortune as if she had made an agreement to favour all his designs,
<PB N="364" REF="383"/>
attempted, at once, the passage of the Scheld; and he succeeded without drawing a sword<NOTE N="V" PLACE="foot">Nov. 16.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Siege of Brussels raised. Ghent and Bruges re∣covered.</NOTE> The raising of the siege of Brussels was the first con∣sequence of Marlborough's passing the Scheld. The Elector of Bavaria had sat down before that place the day before the allies had crossed the river. Had his Highness invested Brussels when the enemy were fully employed at Lisle, the city must have fallen into his hands. But up∣on the approach of the allies he decamped with the ut∣most precipitation, leaving behind him all his cannon, ammunition, and wounded. The cities which the French had recovered through the treachery of the magistrates, were again lost to the enemy. The retaking of Bruges and Plassendal followed immediately the passage of the Scheld. Ghent surrendered, after a feeble resistance, about the middle of December. At the close of a cam∣paign, where every motion of the French was marked with some loss or some error, the Duke of Vendôme went to Versailles. He durst not pass through Paris, dreading the consequences of the public hatred which his conduct had raised. Irritated by his cold reception at court, he retired to one of his estates; being the fifth Mareschal of France whom Marlborough's success had driven from the service.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Corrupt practices of Marlbo∣rough</NOTE> The glory acquired by the Duke of Marlborough, in recovering the towns which their respective magistrates had betrayed to France, was much tarnished by his own avarice; a vice to which, of all others, he was most sub∣ject. When, in consequence of the battle of Ramillies, the greatest part of Flanders was reduced by the allies, the chief management of the conquered country fell into the hands of general Cadogan, who succeeded Mr. Step∣ney as ambassador from England to the States of Hol∣land<NOTE N="W" PLACE="foot">MS. Memorial to Queen Anne. Original papers.</NOTE>. Cadogan, a man of a profligate and avarici∣ous character, had recommended himself to the protecti∣on and friendship of the Duke of Marlborough, by giv∣ing him the largest proportion of the contributions, which he had privately raised from the magistrates of Ghent, under the promise of his own and the Duke's protection. Marlborough, who had received, at that period, six
<PB N="365" REF="384"/>
thousand pistoles in specie, was so well pleased with the magistracy, that, at their request, he reversed, by his own authority, the regulation for the government which had been signed by himself and the deputies of the States of Holland, on the sixth of October, 1706. These regulations, it seems, interfered with the perqui∣sites of those who had been so liberal to himself. Their gratitude and his protection continued. The magistrates pillaged the people, and the Duke and Cadogan received their proportion of the spoil<NOTE N="X" PLACE="foot">MS. Memorial to Queen Anne. Original papers.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and General Cadogan.</NOTE> The people, thus oppressed by their magistrates, form∣ed the worst opinion of the patrons of persons so unjust and profligate. They believed, though probably with∣out foundation, that Marlborough and Cadogan were privy to the measure of betraying Ghent and Bruges to the French from interested views of their own<NOTE N="Y" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. The conduct of these generals, after retaking the two cities, was calculated to justify suspicions of the worst kind. Though they knew perfectly the treason, and were fully informed concerning the traitors, they not only procured for them a general pardon, but continued them, notwith∣standing the murmurs of an oppressed people, in their for∣mer offices and authority<NOTE N="Z" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. A favour so great was not without an immediate and suitable reward. Two hun∣dred thousand guelders are said to have fallen to the share of Marlborough<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. Cadogan, the intermediate agent in this lucrative transaction, received ten thousand pis∣toles. A magistracy so generous deserved to be support∣ed. They were, therefore, permitted to remain in their departments during the war, though they were known to be in correspondence as well as friendship with France; and though, according to the customs and privileges of the country, they ought to have been changed every year<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Campaign on the Up∣per-Rhine, and in Sa∣voy.</NOTE> In Germany nothing of importance happened during the campaign. The Electors of Bavaria and Hannover, who were opposed to one another, on the Upper-Rhine, were rendered incapable of performing any thing, either worthy of themselves, or of consequence to their respec∣tive allies. The campaign was spent in fortifying their
<PB N="366" REF="385"/>
lines, as neither was in any condition to act with effect in the field. The French army was weakened by de∣tachments sent to Flanders. The troops of the empire were destitute of every thing necessary for war<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">Hannover-papers, 1709.</NOTE>. On the side of Italy, where much was expected, nothing de∣cisive was performed. The Duke of Savoy had made great preparations in the winter; but it was late in the summer before he took the field. Besides his native troops, he had twenty-two thousand men in his army, in the pay of Great Britain and the States. That Prince had formed great and extensive projects. He designed to pass through the territories of the Swiss, to join the troops of the empire in Alsace, and to penetrate into France on that side. He was opposed by the Mareschal de Villars. But, notwithstanding the vigilance of that officer, the Duke found means, by making himself master of Exilles, La Perouse, and Fenestrelles, to open a passage into France, while he secured his own dominions against fu∣ture invasions from that kingdom<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">Hist. d'Angleterre, tom. ii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of Spain.</NOTE> In Spain, which had been the principal object of the war, the allies were least successful. The house of Bour∣bon had three armies in the field; two on the side of Ca∣talonia, under the Duke of Orleans, and the Duke de Noailles; and the third in Estramadura, commanded by the Marquis de Bay. Though Charles the Third had not a force sufficient to face the Duke of Orleans in the field, the latter was prevented from making any decisive pro∣gress by the unprovided condition of his army. He, however, took Tortosa, on the eleventh of July. Denia and Alicant, in the kingdom of Valencia, fell into the hands of the French before the end of the campaign. The Duke de Noailles, opposed by the Prince of Darmstads, performed nothing of importance, except providing his troops with provisions during the campaign at the expence of the Catalonians. The summer passed in a state of ab∣solute inactivity on the side of Portugal. The French, though superior in numbers, attempted nothing. But though the generals on neither side gained any credit by their conduct in the field, they deserved praise for their wisdom and humanity. In imitation of the ancient Ro∣mans,
<PB N="367" REF="386"/>
they entered into a convention, that the labourers on their respective frontiers should not be disturbed, by either side, in cultivating the soil<NOTE N="E" PLACE="foot">Hist. de Portugal, 1708.</NOTE> or in feeding their cattle; and, that the war, for the future, should be con∣sidered as subsisting only between regular armies, and not between the peasantry of the two kingdoms<NOTE N="F" PLACE="foot">Hist. d'Espagne, tom.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sardinia and Minorca re∣duced.</NOTE> The operations of the fleet were attended with consi∣derable success in the present year. Admiral Leake hav∣ing carried to Barcelona the Princess of Wolfembuttle, whom Charles the Third had espoused, directed his course from thence to Cagliari, the capital of Sardinia. The whole island fell into his hands without drawing a sword. When the English fleet appeared, the monks, gained by the cardinal Grimani, ran in bodies to the streets and public places, holding the crucifix in their hands. They assured the inhabitants, who flocked around them, that God had made use of Heretics to give them a better master. They made such an impression on the populace, that the Viceroy, the Marquis of Jamaica, was forced to accept such terms as Leake condescended to grant. The fleet commanded by the same admiral added to this important conquest the reduction of Mi∣norca. The island itself was less considerable in itself than Sardinia; but more valuable to the British nation, on account of the excellent harbour of Port-Mahon. The French and Spaniards lost their courage with their good fortune. The forts which defended Port-Mahon, though provided with every necessary for sustaining a siege, made scarce any shew of defence. After an irregular siege of a few days, some British soldiers, without any orders, marched into their lines. The enemy, struck with con∣sternation at their sudden approach, surrendered the place upon terms<NOTE N="G" PLACE="foot">Hist. of Europe, 1708.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of Italy.</NOTE> While the maritime powers were employed in the re∣duction of the Italian islands under the government of the house of Austria, the Emperor alarmed the princes and republics of Italy by the renewal of antiquated claims on their dominions. He published a manifesto, wherein he declared, that he was resolved to pursue the rights of the Imperial crown, against such States as could not ex∣hibit
<PB N="368" REF="387"/>
authentic proofs, that their titles to their territories were derived from the unanimous consent of the empire. In consequence of his declaration, he ordered the Duke of Parma to pay homage for his dominions within fif∣teen days, under the pain of confiscation. These obso∣lete and prescribed claims spread a general consternation, The Republics of Venice and Genoa, the Dukes of Mo∣dena, Savoy, and Tuscany, were all interested in the Emperor's demands. The house of Bourbon entertained hopes of forming a confederacy in Italy against a prince so unjust and unreasonable. But their expectations were quashed by the reduction of the islands in the Mediter∣ranean, a circumstance that enabled the maritime powers to awe the Italian States with their fleets. But the ani∣madversion with which Joseph threatened other powers, he actually put in execution against the Pope. That Pontiff, who had hitherto adhered to the interests of Philip the Fifth, was forced to promise to acknowledge Charles the Third as lawful King of Spain, to prevent Rome itself from being a second time sacked by the Im∣perialists<NOTE N="H" PLACE="foot">Hist. of Europe, 1708.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of the Prince of Denmark.</NOTE> During these transactions abroad, the nation, in their attention to the events of war, seemed to lose their for∣mer animosities and fears. A general tranquillity pre∣vailed, except where it was disturbed by contested elec∣tions for the new parliament. But the joy which the Queen derived from the great succes of her arms, was damped by the death of her husband the Prince of Den∣mark. Having languished for some months, he expired on the twenty-eighth of October. The very defects of his character had recommended this Prince to the affec∣tion of the people. He had scarce any talent for business, and he was destitute of ambition. Having no passion for influence or power, he never entered into the intrigues of parties. The Whigs respected him, as he never in∣terfered with their own views. He loved the Tories, as they had been the chief instruments in procuring for him an eventual pension, in case he had survived the Queen. Mild and humane in his disposition, he possessed the most of those virtues, which are as common as they are agree∣able

in private life. But he was so unfit for a public sta∣tion, that his elevation proved to him a misfortune, as it exposed his weakness to the world. He was, upon the whole, what the husband of a Queen of England ought to have been: a man of two feeble parts to be trouble∣some, and too indolent to interfere in measures which he could not guide. The Queen, who had exhibited every mark of conjugal affection during his illness, seemed in∣consolable at his death. She removed immediately from Kensington where he expired, to the palace of St James's, and shut herself up for several months, with all the symp∣toms of an unfeigned grief<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot">Hist. d'Angleterre, tom. ii.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">New parlia∣ment.</NOTE> The great success of the campaign, confirmed the influence which Marlborough and Godolphin had ac∣quired, by the expulsion of Harley from the cabinet. They found means, at the same time, to reconcile the Whigs to their measures, by dividing with their leaders the power and emoluments of government. The weight of the crown being thrown into the scale of that party, they carried most of the contested elections against the Tories. This secured a majority not to be controuled, in the house of commons. The new parliament having met on the sixteenth of November, the session was open∣ed by commission. The superiority which the court, now consisting entirely of Whigs, had acquired, pre∣cluded opposition, as it could not be attended with any success. Sir Richard Onslow, recommended by the ad∣herents of the crown, was unanimously chosen speaker. As the prevailing party were bent on continuing the war, supplies were granted, not only with liberality, but even without reserve. Seven millions were voted for the ser∣vice of the campaign. In concert with the States, who had agreed to an augmentation of their own troops, ten thousand men were added to the establishment of the pre∣ceding year<NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">Journals, passim.</NOTE>.

The Earl of Pem∣broke,
<PB N="370" REF="389"/>
who had sufficiently concealed his attachment to the late King James<NOTE N="L" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, passim.</NOTE>, to be deemed a firm friend to the Revolution, was raised to the office of lord-admiral, now vacant, by the Death of the Prince of Denmark. Though his lordship had executed the duties of that sta∣tion, with considerable applause, in the end of the last reign, he owed his elevation, at present, more to the places which he had to resign, than to his own merit. Being, at once, lord-president of the council and lord-lieutenant of Ireland, his resignation furnished the minis∣ter with two places of importance to secure the Whigs, by gratifying their leaders. The Lord Somers, who had been out of employment ever since he had been de∣prived of the great-seal by King William, was raised to the head of the council. The Earl of Wharton, a man of profligate abilities, a Whig from faction more than from any principle, was declared in council lord-lieute∣nant of Ireland; and an addition was made to the lift of privy counsellors, to gratify others of the same par∣ty<NOTE N="M" PLACE="foot">Gazettes, Nov. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> Dec. 1708.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Debates on Scotish elec∣tions.</NOTE> These judicious promotions contributed to continue that unanimity in parliament, which rendered the trans∣actions of the session, in a great measure, unimportant. Some debates, concerning Scotish elections, for both houses, raised the attention of many, from the stillness which prevailed in public affairs. Two sons of peers, the Lord Haddo and the Lord Johnston, having been return∣ed to serve for two counties in Scotland, a petition against their right of being elected, was presented to the house of commons. Proofs were produced, that the eldest sons of the nobility had been uniformly rejected by the Scotish parliament, and a vote was passed for vacating the seat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the two lords<NOTE N="N" PLACE="foot">Dec. 6, 1708.</NOTE>.

a circumstance inconsistent with the privilege of peers, who are all deemed equals. Upon a division of the house, the matter was determined against the Duke of Queens∣berry, though he was supported by the whole weight of government<NOTE N="O" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. iv.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1709. Laws of treason ex∣tended to Scotland.</NOTE> Another matter of importance with regard to Scotland, raised the attention and employed the debates of the two houses of parliament. Upon the attempt of an invasion from France, in the preceding year, several peers and gentlemen of rank were seized, by the procurement of the Scotish lords in the ministry, and were brought pri∣soners to London. Though all were suspected of main∣taining a correspondence with the invaders, and many were actually guilty, proof could be carried home to none. They were, therefore, dismissed. But the dis∣grace and expence which they incurred upon bare pre∣sumptions, had induced mankind in general to conclude, that they had been treated with unjust severity. This circumstance, together with a dispute between the court of justiciary and the Queen's advocate in Scot∣land, concerning the trial of some Jacobites in that king∣dom, induced the lords to introduce a bill for extending the laws of treason already established in England, to the whole kingdom of Great Britain. The trials in matters of treason being less severe in Scotland than in England, the whole representative of the former opposed the bill in both houses. It was, however, passed into a law. The commons, to gratify the Scots, in some degree, made an amendment, which directed, that all persons indicted for high treason or misprision of treason, should have not on∣ly a copy of their indictment, but a list of all the witness∣es to be produced, and of the jurors immpanelled, with their professions and places of abode, delivered to them ten days before the trial, and in the presence of two wit∣nesses.

<MILESTONE N="1709" UNIT="year"/> was obnoxious, upon a discovery, to the law. He was not ignorant that he had many enemies who suspected him of treasonable practices, and some who were actually possess∣ed of proofs sufficient to ruin his reputation, if not to en∣danger his head. The Marquis of Annandale, it is said, either by accident or art, had possessed himself of an ori∣ginal letter of the lord-treasurer to the court of St. Ger∣mains. In the beginning of the present session, the Mar∣quis had petitioned against the undue election of one of the peers for Scotland; and, by insinuating that he was privy to Godolphin's secret attachment to the excluded family, he obtained the weight of government and gain∣ed a seat in the house of peers. The Earl of Wharton, perceiving the unexpected success of Annandale, treated with that nobleman for the use of his valuable manuscript. He obtained the letter, and was instantly declared lord-lieutenant of Ireland. The mischievous Wharton was at no pains to keep the secret. The whole junto derived benefit from the discovery. Pembroke, Somers, Dorset, and their retainers, demanded offices and were gratified. But still Godolphin was in danger, till the act of grace passed, in the beginning of the present year. The bill seem∣ed calculated chiefly for the lord-treasurer himself. Few things were pardoned except all correspondence with the court of St. Germains. Wharton, who hoped to derive still greater advantages from the letter, which he is said to have either purchased or obtained from the Marquis of Annandale, was completely outwitted by the Earl of Godolphin. The latter, by assuring him that the mate∣rial business of the session was over, had induced his lordship to repair to his government of Ireland. But the first intelligence he received at Dublin was, that the mi∣nister had escaped from his hands under the sanction of an act of grace.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceedings of Parlia∣ment.</NOTE> The Duke of Marlborough, to whom the act of grace was as convenient as to the Earl of Godolphin, had arrived in London in the end of February<NOTE N="Q" PLACE="foot">Feb. 25.

attack his character and to ruin his power. The Tories, in particular, had joined a personal quarrel against Marl∣borough, to the usual violence of men excluded from the possession of influence and office. They were furnished by the Duke himself with a circumstance suitable to their desires. Cardonnel, Marlborough's secretary, in writing to the Queen a detail of the battle of Winnendal, attri∣buted the whole honour of the affair to General Cadogan, the favourite of his master, who had not the least share in the action. General Webb, to whose activity and cou∣rage the victory was principally ascribed, was not even named in the letter. Cardonnel's account was made pub∣lic. Webb was enraged. He quitted the army, and re∣turned to London. His own account of the action was printed. The Tories abbetted him in the house of com∣mons; and a vote of thanks was passed, not without ma∣ny severe and personal reflections on Marlborough, who was accused of making use of unjustifiable means to de∣preciate the merit of a deserving officer. Webb himself, it must be confessed, was a great enemy to his own re∣putation, by appearing too sensible of the importance of the service<NOTE N="R" PLACE="foot">Kane's Memoirs.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The two houses urge the Queen to a second marriage.</NOTE> Though the contest between parties ascended not to any degree of violence in the present session, the flame of discord, which soon after arose to an extraordinary height, began already to appear in the debates of both the houses. In one singular address to the throne, an unusual unanimity appeared. The Queen, as head of the church, had ordered, on the thirteenth of January, that the form of prayer, for issue of her body to succeed her in the throne, should be discontinued after the eighth of the next March, the anniversary of her accession to the crown. Mr. Watson, son to the Lord Rockingham, moved, in the house of commons, on the twenty-fifth of January, that an address should be presented to her Ma∣jesty, to moderate her grief, and to entertain thoughts of a second marriage. Though the motion seemed to convey a degree of ridicule, it passed the commons, with∣out opposition, and received the concurrence of the lords. The Queen herself, considering her constitution, and even her years, could scarce look upon the address in any se∣rious

light. Her answer, however, was full of propriety? She said, that the provision which she had made for the Protestant succession, would always be a proof of her wishes for the happiness of the kingdom. But that the subject of their address was of such a nature, that she was persuaded they did not expect a particular answer<NOTE N="S" PLACE="foot">Journals.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Capital of the bank doubled.</NOTE> The commons had, with great alacrity and unanimity, voted the supplies. But the funds, upon which they could be charged, were not so easily found. The minis∣try, at length, fell upon an expedient which answered their necessities. They proposed to double the capital of the bank, and to prolong to one and twenty years its time, which was otherwise to have expired on the first of August 1711. The terms obtained by government for these advantages, were four hundred thousand pounds, at six per cent. and the circulation of two millions four hun∣dred thousand pounds in exchequer-bills. Books were accordingly opened for subscriptions. So eager were the people for employing their money on such advantageous terms, that in less than four hours the whole sum was sub∣scribed. Though the rapidity with which the subscrip∣tion was filled, was rather a proof of the necessities of government than of the wealth of the people, the facility with which such a great sum was raised, was calculated to give a high opinion of the flourishing state of the king∣dom to foreigners. They perceived, with a degree of astonishment, that after such great exertions, in a war of many years, the nation seemed to be so far from being ex∣hausted, that more than the whole annual revenue of states deemed powerful on the continent, was raised in a few hours in this island<NOTE N="T" PLACE="foot">Hist. of Europe, 1709.

The envoy of Holstein Gottorp, first sounded the States-general on the subject. The presi∣dent Rouillé was sent in the beginning of the year to Antwerp, where he had several conferences with the deputies Buys and Vander Dussen. He proceeded soon after to the Hague. The States, cautious of making any advances in an affair of such importance, without the participation of the allies, sent expresses to the courts of Vienna and Great Britain. The Prince of Savoy and the Duke of Marlborough, who had managed, with such astonishing success, the war, were fully empowered, by their respective sovereigns, to treat with the minister of France, and to settle the terms of peace. They ar∣rived, for that purpose, at the Hague, in the beginning of the month of April<NOTE N="W" PLACE="foot">M. de Torcy, tom. i.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Marlbo∣rough, He∣insius, and Eugene, the arbiters of Europe.</NOTE> The Duke of Marlborough and Heinsius, the pensio∣nary of Holland, in the strictest intimacy with Prince Eugene, formed a kind of triumvirate, on whom the grand confederacy, and consequently the fate of Europe depended. The two generals having gained so many bat∣tles, and succeeded in all their arduous and important undertakings, had acquired as much influence with the allies, as they had excited of terror among their enemies. Heinsius had been the depositary of the secrets of King William. He had been raised by that Prince to the place of first minister, and had the good fortune to preserve the authority which he had received, by being the chain which united the States with the grand confederacy formed by his late patron against the house of Bourbon. All the three seemed to have a personal interest in opposing the peace. The Duke of Marlborough, besides the thrist of glory, which was probably common to him with other men, had an opportunity, by a continuance of the war, to gratify a passion still more predominant in his mind, the love of money. Prince Eugene, being a soldier of for∣tune, had no business with tranquillity, in which generals are commonly laid aside to rust with their swords. Hein∣sius, besides the dread of losing his importance at home,
<PB N="376" REF="395"/>
by breaking the line which connected him with foreign powers, was absolutely under the dominion of Marlbo∣rough, whose address in the cabinet was still more irre∣sistible, than his conduct in the field.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The French form hopes on the cha∣racters of Marlbo∣rough and Heinsius.</NOTE> The court of France, with their usual refinement, hoped to derive advantage towards the necessary peace, from those very passions and reasons, which seemed to render Marlborough and Heinsius invariably attached to war. They were no strangers to the true state of the first. They built much upon the prudence of the latter, and the character of patriotism which he had already acquir∣ed. They knew that Marlborough, while he possessed such credit and authority abroad, was secretly undermined by his enemies at home. They were told, that a great part of the British nation were offended at seeing the power, influence, and emoluments of government, so long divided between the Duke, the Earl of Godolphin, and their friends. That the mind of the Queen, by the se∣cret artifices of a latent faction, was greatly alienated from the interest of her general, and uneasy at the un∣controuled power of her treasurer. They were assured, that the influence of the first was already in a tottering condition. They supposed that his prudence would sug∣gest to him to provide for the worst; and, therefore, they derived hopes, from his known love of money, that he would be glad to receive a reward from France, in proportion to his merit in delivering her from the calami∣ties of a war, which threatened her with apparent ruin. The authority of Heinsius was by no means on the same precarious footing with that of Marlborough. But the French supposed that, directing chiefly his attention to the interest of his country, he would seize with ardour the very advantageous conditions which were to be offer∣ed by Lewis the Fourteenth, for extinguishing a war, the burden of which lay so heavy on the republic<NOTE N="X" PLACE="foot">M. de Torcy. tom. i.</NOTE>. </P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">But they are deceiv∣ed.</NOTE> The French, however, found themselves deceived in the hopes which they had formed upon the condition of Marlborough, and the character of Heinsius. Though neither of these two great men durst avowedly shew their want of inclination for peace, they were provided with expedients, by breaking off the conferences, to continue the war. The whole business had been hitherto transact∣ed
<PB N="377" REF="396"/>
between Buys and Vander Dussen, the deputies of the States, on the part of the allies, and the president Rou∣illé, in the name of the French King. The terms of∣fered by France were to the last degree humiliating to that monarch. But in proportion as the French minister augmented his concessions, these haughty republicans rose in their demands, in the name of their allies. While affairs were in this unpromising condition, the Duke of Marlborough, whose opinion of his own situation at home agreed not, perhaps, with the hopes the French had formed on that subject, put, at once, a stop to the con∣ferences. He informed the States, that he had orders to prevent all further advances towards a treaty, should France refuse to extend her offers in favour of the Em∣peror and Great Britain<NOTE N="Y" PLACE="foot">M. de Torcy, tom. i.</NOTE>. Prince Eugene insisted, that the entire cession of the Spanish monarchy, together with the re-establishment of the treaty of Munster, should be an indispensable preliminary to the projected treaty<NOTE N="Z" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. Marlborough, at the same time, had the address to ren∣der the sincerity of France suspected, by encouraging a belief, that the sole business of Rouillé in Holland was to amuse and deceive the allies<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Distress of France.</NOTE> The state of France, and the consequent behaviour of her sovereign, form together irresistible proofs, that the continuation of hostilities proceeded more from the views of Marlborough, than from the insincerity of Lewis the Fourteenth. The dominions of France were afflicted with various and dreadful calamities. A desperate famine threatened to extend the waste already made among the inhabitants by the sword. An excessive hard frost, that had been severely felt throughout Europe, was succeeded in France by a sudden thaw, that destroyed all the grain. The spring came on, but the weather continued severe. Not the least promise of maturity was made by the fruits of the earth. Nothing was seen within but misery, de∣solation, and distress. A powerful enemy hovered on the frontiers, with victorious armies. The complaints of the nation were equal to their misfortunes. Intelligence of the wretched state of the French was carried to the allies; and the report augmented their confidence. The ways and means for raising new funds for prosecuting a disas∣trous

war, had not only declined, but were almost va∣nished. The repeated misfortunes, in preceding cam∣paigns, suggested nothing but despair concerning the fu∣ture. Every quarter of Europe was filled with the dis∣graces and misfortunes of France. The confederates, by making themselves masters of Lisle, threatened to pene∣trate into the heart of the French dominions. A Prince, who had carried his arms, a few years before, to the banks of the Danube, the Tagus, and the Po, was now forced to examine whether he could remain in safety at Versailles. His people heard already, in their imagina∣tions, the victors thundering at the gates of Paris. The troops without pay, without clothes, without provisions, led by generals who had lost all authority, by repeated errors, and consequent misfortunes; and an enemy elated by conquest, first prescribing terms and then rejecting them, when adopted by the vanquished.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Melancholy situation of the French court.</NOTE> Neither Lewis nor his servants were possessed of those daring abilities, which supply the absence of force with an indignant pride. When the relation of the last confe∣rence between Rouillé and the deputies of the States was read in council at Versailles, the French ministry resign∣ed themselves to pusillanimity and fear. Instead of as∣suming courage from despair, they yielded to all the me∣lancholy reflections, which misfortunes suggest to the ti∣mid and weak. The campaign was upon the point of being opened on the side of Flanders. A dispirited army, scarce provided with the necessaries of war, only lay be∣tween a powerful and well-conducted enemy and the ca∣pital. They broke up without coming to any resolu∣tion<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">M. de Torcy, tom. i.</NOTE>. The Marquis de Torcy, secretary for foreign affairs, offered to the King his services, as the last resort. Lewis, with an enthusiasm suitable to despair, accepted his offer.

He returned to the Hague, on the seventh of May, accompanied by the Vis∣count Townshend, as ambassador extraordinary to the States, and joint-plenipotentiary from Great Britain, for treating concerning the terms of peace. After many fruitless conferences, it appeared that the allies were not sincere in their avowed declarations of wishing to put an end to the war. France agreed to yield the whole Spa∣nish monarchy to the house of Austria, without any equi∣valent. To cede her conquests on the empire, upon the Upper Rhine. To give Furnes, Ypres, Menin, Tour∣nay, Lisle, Condé, and Mabeuge for a barrier to Hol∣land. To acknowledge the Elector of Brandenburgh, as King of Prussia; the Duke of Hannover, as ninth elector of the empire. To own the title of Queen Anne to the British throne. To remove the Pretender from the dominions of France. To recognise the succession of the throne of Great Britain in the Protestant line.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">rejected by the allies.</NOTE> The obstinacy of the two generals, and the haughtiness of the Dutch, who were elevated beyond measure, at having the management of a treaty, which reduced the French nation so low, prevented the conclusion of a peace, as honourable to the allies, as it was humiliating to the house of Bourbon. Though the entire cession of the Spanish monarchy, or what was virtually the same, the withdrawing all the aid of France from Philip the Fifth, was the whole object of the war, they broke off the conferences, by demanding terms nugatory in them∣selves, as they could not be executed by the French King. The utmost that he could promise, was to leave the King of Spain to the protection of such as should adhere to that prince of his own subjects. But he was not per∣mitted to sorm the most distant hopes of peace, without surrendering the strongest towns in his dominions, as pledges for the entire evacuation of the Spanish domini∣ons by his grandson.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prelimina∣ries of the allies reject∣ed by France.</NOTE> Conference followed conference in vain. The pensi∣onary Heinsius framed, at length, forty preliminary arti∣cles, as the ultimatum of the allies. Though every one of these articles contained the dictatorial language used by conquerors to the vanquished, the plenipotentiaries of France yielded to thirty-five. The other five were re∣ferred to the decision of Lewis the Fourteenth. The Marquis de Torcy repaired for that purpose to Paris. But not withstanding the consternation of the French King and his council, they had the spirit to reject terms of peace, scarce less ruinous and disgraceful, than the evils apprehended from a continuance of hostilities<NOTE N="G" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. The court of France, however, derived some advantage from the conferences at the Hague. They found means to remove the despair of the people, by raising their in∣dignation. They made public the whole negociation. They explained their own enormous concessions, and the haughty terms prescribed, rather than proposed, by the allies. The King himself wrote to all the governors of the provinces a moving relation of the transactions.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Marlbo∣rough sa∣vours the Pretender.</NOTE> In the course of the negociations at the Hague, the Marquis de Torcy, instructed by the court of St. Ger∣mains, mentioned the concerns of the Pretender to the Duke of Marlborough.

That he ought to fix his residence where he pleased, enjoy perfect security, and to be the master of his own motions and journies to whatever country he pleased. The article of subsistence was a matter of
<PB N="381" REF="400"/>
greater difficulty. The payment of her dowry to his mother was proposed by the Marquis de Torcy, as the best expedient. Marlborough desired him to insist stre∣nuously on that article, to the Viscount Townshend. <Q REND="inline">"That lord,"</Q> said Marlborough, <Q REND="inline">"is a kind of inspector over my conduct.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Secret in∣trigues of Marlbo∣rough and Godolphin.</NOTE> The intercourse between Marlborough and Godolphin and the court of St. Germains, continued, in some de∣gree, to be carried on by the agents of the latter in Eng∣land. The more important part of the correspondence, however, lay between the Duke of Marlborough and the Duke of Berwick<NOTE N="L" PLACE="foot">M. de Torcy.</NOTE>. He made no secret to his nephew of his absolute and fixed resolution of restoring the ex∣cluded family to the British throne. His own victories having rendered France incapable, even had she been willing, to aid the cause of the Pretender, he had long signified his desire, that that unfortunate Prince should remove from the French dominions. The Duke himself and the Earl of Godolphin, who was still more sincere in his attachment to the exiled branch of the Stuarts, per∣ceived that the greatest obstacle to the accomplishment of their views, proceeded from the unsurmountable aver∣sion the people entertained against the having a King im∣posed upon them by France. The lord-treasurer, in par∣ticular, affirmed, that his own inexplicable conduct, in turning the Tories out of office, was to facilitate the as∣suring the succession to the Pretender, whom he digni∣fied with the name of King. He knew the Tories, he said, to be passionate, unsteady, and unfit for business. He, therefore, resolved to bend gradually the Whigs
<PB N="382" REF="401"/>
to his purpose, men who regarded less the person of the successor, than the certainty of possessing, in his name, the power of the crown. He hoped, he said, by ma∣nagement to extricate the Pretender from the hands of France; and, by gradually reconciling the people to his character and person, to ensure his succession to his sister's throne<NOTE N="M" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1710.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Views of</NOTE> The Pretender himself seemed to have been fensible, that his remaining in France was, by no means, favoura∣ble to his expectations and designs. When he returned from his expedition to the coast of Scotland, he attended the Duke of Burgundy in Flanders, and served under that Prince in the preceding campaign. During that period, he sent repeatedly to Scotland, to announce his fixed re∣solution of passing, in a hired vessel, into that kingdom, and to place himself in the hands of his friends. If he could not establish himself in the south, he intended to retire to the fastnessess and inaccessible vallies of the High∣lands, under the protection of the clans. The nobility in Scotland, who were in his interest, discouraged a pro∣ject, which, they deemed, would inevitably throw him∣self into the hands of his enemies, and totally ruin his friends. Besides, though France was in no condition to support his pretensions, she would not probably dismiss his person. Should he retire clandestinely from that kingdom, Lewis the Fourteenth would most certainly stop the payment of the pittance, which was the sole support of his mother and himself. Though his enemies derived most advantage from the counsels of France, he was impressed with a deep sense of gratitude, for the pro∣tection given to his family<NOTE N="N" PLACE="foot">Pretender's original let∣ters, MS.</NOTE>. He would not, there∣fore, enter into any project without the consent of that kingdom.

Lewis told him, that though he had all the inclination in the world to serve his family, and ultimately himself, by forming a diversion for the arms of the most powerful of his enemies, the thing was absolutely impracticable in the present distressed condition of his affairs. The pretended Prince laid aside, for the time, all hopes of transporting himself into Britain. He acquainted his adherents in Scotland, that they had nothing to hope from the court of Versailles. His servants, in the mean time, endea∣voured to comprehend some part of their own interest in the negociations then carried on at the Hague. They proposed, that the Pretender, as a mark of his gratitude to the French King, should retire to any country the al∣lies might choose, except the Pope's dominions or the Swiss cantons. They earnestly insisted upon a general indemnity to the adherents of the excluded family. They mentioned, on various foundations, the dowry still owing to Queen Mary d'Estè, the Pretender's mother. To all these demands they received favourable answers, could the polite carriage and promises of Marlborough be deem∣ed sincere. But, though Marlborough seems to have ad∣vised the removal of the Pretender from the dominions of France, as necessary to the success of his hopes of the Bri∣tish throne, that Prince disliked his proposal, that Great Britain should, in such a case, charge herself with his maintainance. He deemed it, to use the words of his minister, the Earl of Middleton, a design to make the world believe, that he renounced his pretensions for a pension<NOTE N="P" PLACE="foot">Stuart papers, 1709.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Campaign of 1709.</NOTE> The breaking up of the conferences for the re-esta∣blishment of peace, was immediately followed by vigorous preparations for carrying on the war. The Duke of Marlborough left the Hague, on the ninth of June, to place himself at the head of the consederate army in Flanders. The Prince of Savoy had absolutely refused to go to Spain. Nothing to be done in Italy seemed worthy of his presence. The army on the Rhine had been formed with difficulty, and its motions were slow. He, therefore, resolved to remain in Flanders, and to second the Duke of Marlborough in those great designs, which had probably frustrated the conclusion of an honour∣able and highly advantageous peace. The army was in
<PB N="843" REF="403"/>
a condition suitable to the magnitude of the concerted en∣terprises. The troops, that had gained so much glory and suffered so great losses, in the preceding campaign, had been early recruited. The fresh reinforcements, consisting of some British regiments, and eight thousand Saxons, which the Duke of Marlborough had negociated with King Augustus, had augmented the army of the al∣lies in Flanders, to one hundred and ten thousand combat∣ants<NOTE N="Q" PLACE="foot">Life of Marlborough, vol. ii. Hist. de'Angleterre, tom. iii.</NOTE>. The wretched state, into which a severe winter had reduced France, had facilitated the recruiting of her forces. Those who could procure no bread at home, were forced, for mere sustenance, to inlist them∣selves as soldiers. The army opposed to the allies in Flan∣ders, was commanded by the Mareschal de Villars. Though inferior in number to the enemy, the troops derived a kind of spirit, from their very despair<NOTE N="R" PLACE="foot">Hist. de France. tom. iii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The allies unable to force the enemy to a battle.</NOTE> In the end of June, Prince Eugene and the Duke of Marlborough formed their army, on the plains of Lisle. The number of their troops, their confidence in their own conduct, the consternation of the French, and their promises to the allies to disperse the army of the enemy, and to penetrate into the heart of France, rendered those able generals extremely anxious to bring matters, by a battle, to a decision. The Mareschal de Villars had occu∣pied a strong post, between Couriere and the town of Bethune, which covered both his wings. He was defend∣ed in front, by the villages of la Bassée and Pont-Avendin. He covered, by this position of his army, the cities of Doway and Arras, the taking of which would have open∣ed a wide passage to the allies in the heart of France. The generals of the confederates having advanced within two leagues of the enemy, rode out on the twenty-fourth of June to view their situation. Finding it too strong to venture a battle, they decamped in the night, and sat suddenly down before Tournay<NOTE N="S" PLACE="foot">Kane's Memoirs. Life of Marlborough.</NOTE>. Villars, afraid of being attacked in his camp, had injudiciously weakened the garrison of Tournay to five thousand men; and it was the intelligence received by the allies concerning this

It had been from time immemorial subject to France, till it fell into the hands of Henry the Eighth, King of England, in the year 1513. It was, however, soon after restored, through the intrigues and influence of Cardinal Wolsey. The Spaniards took Tournay in the year 1618. But having been retaken by Lewis the Fourteenth, in the year 1667, it was rendered, by new fortifications, one of the strongest places in the Netherlands. The situation of the town is extremely advantageous for defence. No commanding heights are near; and it is so well covered on every side, that an ene∣my must be in possession of the covered way, to batter in breach. The Scheld, which divides the town, must naturally divide the enemy; a circumstance often incon∣venient and always dangerous. The citadel, fortified with all the skill of Vauban, was still more strong than the town. The place, however, was so well attacked, or so ill defended, that it fell into the hands of the allies, after one and twenty days open trenches. The governor entered the citadel, with the remains of his garrison, on the thirtieth of July. But, at the end of a month, he also surrendered that place<NOTE N="U" PLACE="foot">Hist. d'Angleterre, tom. ii</NOTE>.</P>

Villars, having formed the resolution of preserv∣ing or relieving the place, passed the Scarpe, and encamp∣ed between that river and the Scheld. Finding himself disappointed in his hopes of arriving before the main army of the allies at Mons, he stopt short at Malplaquet, a village scarce a league distant from that city.

His right extended to the village of Malplaquet, which lay behind the extensive and impenetrable wood of Sart. His

left was covered with another deep wood. Along a very narrow plain, opposed to his centre, he drew trenches be∣hind trenches, and covered the whole with a row of trees, with all their branches, which he had cut down and car∣ried from the neighbouring woods. The generals of the confederates, resolving to dislodge the French from their strong post, viewed their situation, on the tenth of Sep∣tember, and fixed upon the next day for the execution of their plan<NOTE N="V" PLACE="foot">Mem. de Fenquiere.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Malplaquet,</NOTE> Scarce had day-light appeared, when the two armies, having prepared themselves in the night for action, were seen ranged in complete order of battle. The allies had resolved to attack, at once, the whole line of the enemy. The British troops were opposed to the left, the Dutch to the right, and the Germans to the center of the French. The Mareschal de Villars placed himself at the head of his left wing. He committed the charge of the right to the Mareschal de Boufflers, who, though his senior, con∣sented to act a second part. After an awful suspence and silence for near two hours, the battle began at eight of the clock. In a moment the firing extended from wing to wing. Few ages ever produced so long, so obstinate, so bloody a battle. The allies were roused by their for∣mer victories. The French, were become, in a manner, furious, through despair. The Duke of Argyle, with the left of the British troops, passing through a morass, deemed impracticable, charged, with fury, the enemy stationed in the wood, in his front, and drove them into the plain behind, where they instantly formed. This circumstance contributed greatly to the success of the allies. Villars, as had been foreseen, weakened his cen∣ter to support his left wing against the fierce assault of the British infantry. The French sustained, with uncom∣mon firmness, all the efforts of their enemies, in the plain. They even drove them back into the wood from which they themselves had been driven. The carnage was im∣mense. But neither side shewed any inclination to put an end to slaughter by flight<NOTE N="W" PLACE="foot">Hist d'Angleterre, tom. ii. Kane's Memoirs.</NOTE>.</P>

in three lines, to the entrenchments, they made and sus∣tained a terrible fire, for the space of an hour. Some battalions giving way before them, were brought back and confirmed in their station, by the vigilance, courage, and activity of the Mareschal de Boufflers. The Dutch, in their turn, gave ground a little way. Some French battalions, emboldened by their own resistance, rushed from their entrenchments, pushed the enemy from one of their batteries, seized their colours, and regaining their post, sustained a second charge. The unexpected obsti∣nacy of the French, in both wings, induced the generals of the confederates to entertain thoughts of desisting from the attack. General Cadogan, in that instant, perceived the void left in the centre of the enemy, by the troops called by Villars to support his left. Prince Eugene re∣solved to attack, in person, the intrenchments in that place. He led some fresh battalions to the charge. He entered the line of the enemy. He flanked a regiment of French guards, and forced them to fly. Villars, hast∣ening to support his centre, was wounded and carried from the field. The Mareschal de Boufflers, notwithstanding, sustained the fight with obstinacy. The cavalry of the allies had already entered his lines. He ordered the Che∣valier de St. George, who served in this campaign, to advance at the head of twelve hundred of the horse∣guards. In one desperate shock the German horse were broken and dissipated. But the two generals of the al∣lies, who, on that occasion, joined the valour of soldiers to the conduct of great captains, rallied their cavalry, forced the enemy back on their lines, and advancing slow∣ly, but firmly, under the fire of thirty pieces of cannon, showed, by their steady motions, that they were resolved to gain the field<NOTE N="X" PLACE="foot">M. de Feuquiere.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The French retreat.

He carried off all his cannon, except fourteen pieces, dis∣mounted in the action. His retreat partook, in nothing, of slight. It was neither confused nor precipitate. The enemy were in no condition to press upon his rear. They comented themselves with the field of battle, now cover∣ed
<PB N="388" REF="407"/>
with near forty thousand men, comprehending the wounded and the slain. This battle was one of the most bloody, and, perhaps, the most singular, that had been fought for several ages. The trophies were few in num∣ber, and they were reciprocal. The generals and officers, on both sides, acted their respective parts with distinguish∣ed conduct; and all their efforts were supported by the troops with consummate courage. Though the field of battle remained in the possession of the allies, the French obtained an honour almost equal to that of victory, by a steady, regular, judicious, and safe retreat. The loss of the confederates, in this bloody action, amounted to twenty thousand men. The French left more than eight thousand dead on the field. Though the abilities of Prince Eugene and the Duke of Marlborough extri∣cated themselves with honour from this hazardous attack, men could scarce forgive their rashness in throwing away the lives of thousands, without any necessity. Mons might have been taken without a battle. The confederates, at least, might have had the choice of their own ground<NOTE N="Y" PLACE="foot">Kane's Memoirs. M. de Feuquiere.</NOTE>. Mons was invested on the twenty-fifth of September. The surrender of that place, on the twentieth of Octo∣ber, put an end to the campaign on the side of Flanders.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Operations on the Up∣per-Rhine.</NOTE> The unprovided state of the Imperialists scarce main∣tained the shew of war, on the Upper-Rhine. The Elector of Brunswick, who commanded the army of the Empire, formed some important schemes. But he found the troops in no condition to second his designs. He pro∣posed to pass the Rhine, and to penetrate into the Upper Alsace, while the Duke of Savoy should cross the Rhone and enter Franche-comté, where the two armies were to join. The Elector executed his part of the plan, as far as he was permitted by the wretched state of the forces under his command. The Duke of Savoy, displeased with the Emperor, became careless concerning the fate of the war. The Elector, in prosecution of his part of the scheme, detached Count Merci, with a strong body of troops, into the Upper Alsace. But on the twenty-sixth of August, that general was totally defeated by the Count de Bourg, and forced, with the shattered remains of his forces, to repass the Rhine. The defeat of Merci
<PB N="389" REF="408"/>
ended all military operations on that side. The Elector, during the remaining part of the campaign, kept himself within his lines; while the French, under the Mares∣chal d'Harcourt, raised heavy contributions in the neigh∣bourhood of Landau and in the Marquisate of Baden<NOTE N="Z" PLACE="foot">Hist. d'Angleterre, tom. ii.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Campaign in Dauphine and Spain.</NOTE> The disputes between the Emperor and the Duke of Savoy, concerning some territories in the duchy of Milan, rendered the campaign inactive on the side of Dauphiné. The Duke refused to take the field in person. His troops remained upon the defensive; and the French were too feeble to make any attack of importance. In Spain, the principal and first object of contest, the war, as usual, was neglected by the confederates. The French King, either with a view to peace, or on account of the ex∣hausted state of his own kingdom, had withdrawn his troops from Spain; and devolved on his grandson the de∣fence of his own dominions. That Prince, thus left to his own resources, obtained considerable advantages over Charles the Third, and the Portugueze. The Cheva∣lier d'Alsfeldt took the castle of Alicant, on the seven∣teenth of April. The Earl of Galway was totally defeat∣ed by the Marquis de Bay, on the seventh of May, in the province of Estramadura. The Duke de Noailles, who commanded in Catalonia, obtained some advantages over the allies. But the Count Staremberg, who led the forces of Charles the Third in that kingdom, having endeavoured, in vain, to force the Mareschal de Bezons to a battle, took Balaguier, in his presence, and, with that success, put an end to the campaign<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Publications of the Times.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Naval af∣fairs.</NOTE> Nothing remarkable happened at sea, in the course of the present year. The French, scarce able to support their armies by land, were utterly incapable of fitting out any fleet. Britain was, for some time, amused with great preparations made in her ports. But the armament which was destined, it was said, for the coast of France, produced nothing but motions among the militia of that kingdom.

They took the island of St. Thomas from the Portugueze. They made themselves masters of Fort St. John on the east coast of Newfoundland. These disadvantages, though trivial in themselves, raised some murmurs among the people. They complained, with reason, that while a numerous fleet, supported at a vast expence, lay useless in their ports at home, or were employed, with an idle parade, in carrying ineffectual succours to Spain, the trade of the kingdom was left to the mercy of a contemp∣tible enemy<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">Naval History</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The battle of Pultowa.</NOTE> During these transactions in the west of Europe, a sig∣nal event in the east contributed to render memorable the present year. The astonishing good fortune which had so long attended the King of Sweden, began to desert his arms in the end of the preceding campaign. But his affairs were not completely ruined till the fatal battle of Pultowa, which was fought on the eleventh of July. Having resolved to carry the war against the Czar into the heart of Russia, and encouraged by the defection of the Cossacks, he precipitately entered the Ukrain. His communication with Poland being cut off, he was reduced to the greatest distress for want of military stores and provisions. To supply himself at the expence of his enemies he sat down before Pultowa, which was full of magazines of every kind. The Czar marched to relieve the place. The King of Sweden abandoned at once his own fate to the decision of a battle. He himself had taught the Russians to conquer. His whole army was either destroyed in the action, or forced, soon after, to surrender at discretion. He crossed the Boristhenes, with three hundred of his guards. He gained Oczakow. He retired to Bender. His whole party fell with his change of fortune. King Augustus re-entered Poland. He was followed by the Czar. The Swedes retired to their own country; and King Stanislaus, deserting a throne which he could no longer hold, joined his unfor∣tunate patron at Bender<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">Hist. du Nord, tom. ii.</NOTE>.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">France makes over∣tures of peace.</NOTE> Though the King of Sweden, during his prosperity, shewed no inclination to interfere in the war between the house of Bourbon and the confederates, the latter were relieved from a considerable degree of anxiety by the to∣tal ruin of that Prince's affairs. The French, though their intrigues had not hitherto prevailed upon Charles to espouse their cause, derived some faint hopes from his indignation against the Emperor's open breach of the treaty of Alt-Ranstadt, which the former had, in a man∣ner, extorted from the court of Vienna, by the terror of his arms. They found that their safety depended wholly on themselves; and, though the campaign had not proved so fatal to their affairs as they had reason to apprehend, their wretched state could promise nothing from a continuance of the war, but a series of misfor∣tunes. The court of Versailles resolved, therefore, to renew their applications for a negociation of peace. This however could not be effected, either suddenly or with ease. Though the success of the allies had not an∣swered their own expectations, the same difficulties which had frustrated the design of the former conferences continued. The very preliminary articles which France had rejected before the opening of the campaign, had become a new bond of union between the confederates; and, in some measure, a new law from which they could not recede. When, therefore, Lewis the Fourteenth demanded passes for his commissioners to go to the Hague, they were refused by the States-General. But they per∣mitted Pettekum, the envoy of Holstein, to make a jour∣ney to Paris, to know what further offers the court of France were ready to make to the confederates<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">M. de Torcy, tom. ii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Secret in∣trigues,</NOTE> But before any progress was made in the overtures of∣fered by France, events happened in Britain, which proved ultimately favourable to the re-establishment of the public tranquillity. The attempts of Harley in the cabinet, against the power of Marlborough and Godol∣phin, were rather suspended than defeated, by his re∣moval from office. The violence of the Duchess of Marlborough, who seemed inclined to retrieve by force the power she had lost with the Queen, contributed to confirm the influence of her rival with that Princess.
<PB N="392" REF="411"/>
Harley, through the means of the favourite, had fre∣quent access to the closet<NOTE N="E" PLACE="foot">Duchess of Marlborough.</NOTE>. He owed no favour to the ministry; and he is said to have embarrassed their measures. But had they retained the confidence of the people, they might have been, in some degree, inde∣pendent of the changed affections of the sovereign. The nation felt the grievous burden of the war, and they be∣gan to wish ardently for peace. The terms proposed to the French King, or rather imposed upon that Prince, in the conferences of the preceding May, though humili∣ating to France, contained no satisfaction, no concession of territory to Britain. The power that had most con∣tributed, with troops, with valour, and with treasure, to subdue the enemy, was admitted to no share in his spoils. Cities, provinces, and monarchies, were trans∣ferred to the rest of the confederates.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and open complaints.</NOTE> These general observations, made by the people, were inflamed into complaints, by men who had an interest in opposing the ministry. The Tories, who had been long borne down by the splendid measures of Marlborough and Godolphin, began again to rear their heads and to rail at their conduct. Their retainers carried to the pul∣pit and press, such accusations of their opponents as suited their own views. Though many circumstances were ex∣aggerated, there was certainly much ground for complaint. A want of attention to the interests of the nation, in de∣feating its hopes of peace, upon terms honourable to Bri∣tain, and profitable to the rest of the allies, a neglect of the war in Spain, an exclusive attention to that in Flan∣ders, the inactivity of the fleet, the decay of trade, for want of protection from the private armed vessels of the enemy, were all brought to the great account, with which the ministry were charged, with some colour of justice. To these accusations they added others, more to alarm the prejudices of the weak, than convince the sen∣sible part of the nation. The cry, that the church was in danger, was renewed in all its force; and this circum∣stance

was advanced with a confidence, that induced ma∣ny to believe the intelligence true<NOTE N="G" PLACE="foot">Publications of the times. Burnet, vol. iv.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Parliament meets, Nov. 15.</NOTE> But though the current began to turn, its progress was, hitherto, slow. The success of the campaign in Flan∣ders, had flattered the people into a kind of forgetfulness of their own complaints. They were again reconciled to a war, from which the kingdom derived so much re∣nown. On the fifteenth of November, the parliament met at Westminster. The Queen, who, on account of the death of her husband, had not made her appearance in the preceding season, opened the present session, in person. The speeches of Princes are the echoes of the voice of their principal servants. The Queen expressed the usual sentiments concerning the war, and demanded the usual supplies. She complained that France had made use of all her artifices to amuse the allies, with false appearances and deceitful insinuations of her desire of peace<NOTE N="H" PLACE="foot">Jour∣nals, Nov. 15.</NOTE>. Though the contrary was certainly the fact, the assertion was necessary to justify the continu∣ance of the war. The commons, with great unanimity and zeal, proceeded on the supplies. More than six mil∣lions were demanded and granted. The whole was placed on good and sufficient funds<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot">Journals, passim.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Doctor Sa∣cheverell,</NOTE> The unanimity of the commons was suddenly destroy∣ed by an affair, trivial in itself, but important in its con∣sequences. A brief detail of facts, will throw sufficient light on a subject rendered tedious and perplexed, by the zeal of contending parties. Henry Sacheverell, who kindled this new flame between the Whigs and Tories, was a clergyman, neither eminent in his character, nor obscure in his profession; vehement by nature, a warm zealot from principle, attached to the most extravagant doctrines of the high-church, a determined enemy to dissenters, to occasional conformists, and their abettors the whole party of the Whigs. Having distinguished himself in the country by his zeal, and even by his vio∣lence, he was called, by a popular election, to a church in Southwark. Having a more extensive field for propa∣gating his doctrines, he became soon to be generally known and followed, by those who favoured most the
<PB N="394" REF="413"/>
principles of the high-church. On the fifth of Novem∣ber of the present year, the anniversary of the gun-pow∣der-plot, having obtained the pulpit at St. Paul's, he de∣livered a sermon, before the lord mayor and the court of aldermen, full of those expressions of complaint and jea∣lousy, which were common to him with his whole party. In this discourse, he inveighed with passion, if not with indecency, against the dissenters, and the moderate part of the church of England; and, at the same time, con∣veyed severe strictures upon those in power. He incul∣cated also, in strong and vehement terms, the doctrine of passive obedience and non-resistance, which, in its great∣est latitude, was inconsistent with the late revolution<NOTE N="J" PLACE="foot">Journals, Dec. 13.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">his extraor∣dinary ser∣mon.</NOTE> The majority of the court of aldermen being attached to the principles of the low-church, refused to thank Sa∣cheverell, or to desire him to print his sermon, a com∣pliment usually paid to those who preach before them on solemn days. The lord mayor was of the opposite party. He encouraged the Doctor, not only to publish the dis∣course, but to present it to him, in a dedication conceived in the same vehement strain with the sermon. The na∣tion was composed of such combustible materials, that the least spark was sufficient to kindle the whole into a flame. The contests between leaders, for places of trust, profit, and power, had been improved into a settled principle; among their respective adherents. The two parties be∣yond the hope of conviction, had been long persuaded, that their antagonists were determined to run into the most dreadful extremities, and to ruin the nation. The Tories believed, that the Whigs intended to establish a republican system of civil government, and to destroy the church. The Whigs were convinced, that the Tories were resolved to persecute the dissenters, and to place the Pretender on the throne. The reception given to the sermon, and to the opinions formed of the Doctor, were suitable to the extravagant passions of the two parties. The Tories extolled him as a person, who stood alone unsubdued in desence of the church, now on the brink of ruin. The Whigs gave him the name of a popish per∣secutor, an enemy to the revolution, a devoted friend to the Pretender. The vehemence of both excited to such a pitch the curiosity of the whole people, that forty thou¦sand
<PB N="395" REF="414"/>copies of the sermon were circulated in the space of a few weeks<NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">Publications of the times.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He is im∣peached.</NOTE> The ministry, in an evil hour for their own power, suffered their passions, on this occasion, to overcome their prudence. The Earl of Godolphin, in particular, who was personally attacked in the sermon, was extremely irritated against the preacher. The leaders of the Whigs, in general, shewed great eagerness to punish severely the man who attacked, with such boldness, those principles which they had held forth so long to the world. The crown lawyers were consulted. They declared, that the offence was not punishable by common law. The more moderate part of the ministry proposed, that the sermon should be only burned, by the order of both houses, and the author confined during the session. The most violent declared, that a more solemn punishment was necessary, to stigmatise a crime of such dangerous tendency. They proposed, therefore, an impeachment, as the most digni∣fied mode of proceeding against a man, in whose person they resolved to punish his whole party. Complaint of the sermon was accordingly made in the house of com∣mons<NOTE N="L" PLACE="foot">Dec. 13, 1703.</NOTE>. Sacheverell was ordered to attend, on the fourteenth of December. He was taken into custody, and instantly impeached. The high-church party flew into the most violent resentment. The whole people were roused to attention. Many were alarmed. The emissaries of the two parties spread the flame with suc∣cessful zeal. They neglected their private concerns. The business of the public was neglected. All looked forward with eagerness, to this one point, as if the fate of the nation depended on the issue of Sacheverell's im∣peachment.</P>

On the ninth of January 1710, the commons exhibited the articles, being four in num∣ber, against Dr. Sacheverell. They affirmed, that the Doctor suggested and maintained, that the necessary means for effectuating the late Revolution, were odious and unjustifiable. That the toleration to dissenters was both unreasonable and unwarrantable. That the church of England was in danger, under the Queen's administra∣tion.
<PB N="396" REF="415"/>
<MILESTONE N="1710" UNIT="year"/> That there were persons in office, that endeavour∣ed to overturn the constitution; and that, through the whole management of affairs, there was a general malad∣ministration and corruption. Sacheverell's answer was artful and judicious. He denied the charge in general, but evaded the particulars. The replication of the commons employed some time. The whole course of the pro∣ceedings was slow; and the high-church party were thus furnished with time to gain the people to their side. The clergy in general espoused the cause of Sacheverell. The pulpits resounded every where with his praise. He was called the champion of the established religion, the only person who stood in the breach, against the designs form∣ed by the Whigs against the very being of the church. The populace were inflamed into a degree of madness against the whole party; and the enthusiasm, which they had frequently converted to forward their own views, was now turned, with redoubled fury, on themselves<NOTE N="M" PLACE="foot">Publications of the Times.</NOTE>.</P>

During three weeks, the time it continued, London was a scene of riot, anarchy, and confusion. The populace daily at∣tended Sacheverell, from his lodgings in the Temple to Westminster-hall, and rent the air with acclamations of applause. They were even animated to such a pitch of fury, that they pulled down several dissenting meeting∣houses, threatened several peers of the opposite party with violence, and insulted such members of the house of commons, as were most eager against their favourite<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> The tiral, in the mean time, proceeded.

Sacheverell was principally defended by his council, by shewing that his expressions, without being wrested from their true meaning, could not be applied to the crimes of which he was accused. When the coun∣sel had ended the defence, Sacheverell himself concluded, with reading a speech, in which he justified his doctrines with some energy and a great deal of heat, expressing his approbation of the revolution, and his respect for the reigning Queen and her government<NOTE N="N" PLACE="foot">Printed speech.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Debates of the lords.</NOTE> When the accusation and defence were ended, the lords entered into warm debates. The arguments, on both sides, partook more of the nice distinctions of the schools, than of that manly and decisive reasoning, more to be wished for than expected among great bodies of men. None defended absolutely the doctrine of non-resistance. But several, though they avowed their con∣cern in the late Revolution, affirmed, that those who ex∣amined it least were its best friends. A bishop said, that a veil ought to be thrown over that transaction. That men should rather call it a vacancy and an abdication, than receive its benefits, as the consequence of resistance. The Duke of Leeds improved on these puerile refine∣ments, in a very long and laboured speech. He owned, that he had a great share in the Revolution; but he ne∣ver thought, he said, that things would have been driven so far, as to settle the crown on the Prince of Orange. He affirmed, that the Prince had often told him, that he himself had no such thoughts. That a distinction ought to be made between resistance and revolution. That va∣cancy or abdication was the subject of the debates of the convention; and that resistance, a word both dangerous and odious, ought for ever to be forgot. He observed, with peculiar sagacity, that had not the attempt succeed∣ed, it would have certainly been rebellion; and that, for his part, he knew no other but hereditary right<NOTE N="O" PLACE="foot">Parl. debates.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sacheverell found guil∣ty.</NOTE> Though the arguments, on the other side, were neither new, nor, perhaps, conclusive, they were more intelligi∣ble and manly. The lords, as the result of the debate, declared, that the articles exhibited by the commons were proved. But they found it difficult to determine, what
<PB N="398" REF="417"/>
censure should be passed on Sacheverell. Those who ar∣gued most against his doctrines, seemed least inclined to be severe. The populace were already inflamed to a de∣gree of fury. Many dreaded personal insults. Some were afraid of commotions, which the enemies of the kingdom might improve to their own advantage. A few, who thought they had gone too far, from a prudent regard to their own interest, began dexterously to fall down with the tide. The sentence, therefore, which was passed, if not unequal to the guilt of Sacheverell, was certainly unsuitable to the dignity of his accusers and the solemnity of his trial. He was suspended, for three years, from preaching, and his sermon was ordered to be burned by the hands of the common hangman. The famous decree of the university of Oxford, passed upon occasion of the Rye-house plot, in the year 1683, was also burned by a vote of the lords. This decree, in an uncommon strain of servility, recognized the doctrine of passive obedience and non-resistance in the most unlimited sense of the words, owned the absolute and indefeasible rights of Kings, and the unalterableness of the hereditary succession to the crown<NOTE N="P" PLACE="foot">Printed Decree.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prelimina∣ries of peace offered by France.</NOTE> While the whole attention of the British nation was en∣gaged by the prosecution of Dr. Sacheverell, the French continued to make earnest solicitations to the allies, for the restoration of the public tranquillity. The opening made by Pettekum, the envoy of Holstein, in the end of the year, induced the court of Versailles to offer the sending plenipotentiaries, to any part in Holland or Flan∣ders the States General should appoint, to enter into immediate negociations of peace. They proposed, in∣stead of the preliminaries signed by the allies, in the pre∣ceding year, to reduce their own concessions into a more comprehensive, but an equally ample form. The French King engaged himself to acknowledge Charles the Third as King of Spain, to withdraw all succours from his grand∣son, to forbear sending him any future assistance, to for∣bid his subjects to inlist in his service, to consent that no part of the Spanish monarchy should ever be united with France. To the Emperor and empire, he promised to restore the city of Strasbourg, the town of Brisac, to content himself with Alsace, in the literal sense of the
<PB N="399" REF="418"/>
treaty of Munster, to cede the town of Landau, to rase all his fortifications on the Rhine, from Basil to Philips∣burgh, to acknowledge the King of Prussia, and the Elector of Hannover. With regard to Great Britain, he engaged himself to acknowledge Queen Anne, and the protestant succession, to restore Newfoundland, and to de∣molish the fortifications and ruin the harbour of Dunkirk, to consent that the Pretender should leave the dominions of France. To the States he promised to yield the bar∣rier specified, in their own preliminaries, to confirm his former offers, with regard to their trade. To the Duke of Savoy he granted all the demands of the allies. But in return, he expected that the Electors of Bavaria and Cologn, should be restored to their territories and dignities<NOTE N="Q" PLACE="foot">De Torcy, tom. ii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Conferences at Gertruy∣denberg</NOTE> These proposals being rejected by the allies, France made additions to her concessions. Having obtained passes from the States, the court of Versailles dispatched the Mareschal d'Huxelles and the Abbé de Polignac, as her plenipotentiaries to conclude a peace. These ministers arrived at Moerdyke on the ninth of March. After va∣rious conferences with Buys and Vander Dussen, the de∣puties of the States, they opened, on the twentieth of the month, a serious negociation of peace at Gertruyden∣berg. During repeated conferences, with the interventi∣on of several expresses, sent by the plenipotentiaries to Versailles for further powers, the French departed from almost all the reservation they had made, in the prelimi∣naries sent in the beginning of the year to Holland. They agreed to relinquish every demand of an equivalent for the cession of the Spanish monarchy. They offered even a subsidy of a million of livres a month to the allies, till King Philip should be driven from Spain. They relin∣quished even Alsace to the Emperor; and, as a security for the performance of the articles of the treaty, engaged to deliver the fortified towns of French Flanders, into the hands of the allies.

Men who profited fo much by the war, were not likely to facilitate the conclusion of peace. Their influence with Heinsius, who had established a kind of unlimited power over the councils of the States, facilitated the completion of their views. Safe in a per∣son in whom they had reason to place an unbounded con∣fidence, they contrived to induce the Emperor and the Queen of Great Britain to throw the whole negociation into the hands of the republic. The characters of the Dutch deputies, who managed the conferences at Ger∣truydenberg, were more calculated to embarrass any ne∣gociation, than to bring it to a happy conclusion. Buys, was a vain, confident, and tedious man. He mistook his own loquacity for eloquence; and being passionately fond of displaying this talent, involved his subject in figures and unmeaning declamation. Vander Dussen was worse than a mere cypher in this conference; as his silence, by being taken for assent, confirmed his colleague in his imperti∣nences<NOTE N="S" PLACE="foot">Ibid. tom i</NOTE>. In the hands of such men, it was not likely that any negociation, however favourable the terms might have been to the allies, could be be brought to any de∣gree of forwardness, before the season proper for com∣mencing the operations of the campaign.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Campaign <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Flanders.</NOTE> While ineffectual conferences for restoring peace con∣tinued at Gertruydenberg, the allies carried on the war in Flanders, with an appearance of vigour. The Duke of Marlborough and the Prince of Savoy, having assembled the army near Tournay, in the middle of April, entered the French lines, without resistance, and sat down before Douay, in the beginning of May.

in the first week in May, and the siege was not ended till the twenty-ninth of June. The enemy having assembled near Péronne, advanced toward Cambray, with a force sufficient to relieve Douay. But the defeat of one army might endanger the fall of the state; and, therefore, the Mareschal de Villars, who commanded the French, af∣ter having advanced within cannon shot of the allies, thought proper to retire, leaving Douay to its fate.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Several places taken by the allies.</NOTE> He observed the same line of prudence throughout the whole of the present campaign.

The long resistance made by those towns, comprehended the whole operations of the war, on the side of Flanders. The allies gained three places of importance, and con∣quered twelve leagues of a fine country. But they lost twenty-six thousand men by the sword. Half their in∣fantry was ruined by wounds, diseases, and fatigue<NOTE N="W" PLACE="foot">Hist. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'Angleterre.</NOTE>. The French experienced but one instance of good fortune in the present summer. The garrison of Ypres cut off a convoy, with military stores, carried in boats along the Lys, under the command of the Earl of Athlone. Hav∣ing gallantly defended himself for some time, his whole in∣santry, consisting of more than one thousand men, were either slain or taken. The cavalry were broken and dis∣persed. The boats and stores were taken. The victors hav∣ing carried away whatever was portable, set fire to the ma∣gazine of powder. The explosion was so violent, that some neighbouring villages were overturned. The earth trembled all the way to Valenciennes, and even to St. Quintin, and the Lys was separated into two channels, by the opening of the ground, and its navigation interrupted.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of Germany, and Savoy.</NOTE> The same inactivity which disgraced former campaigns, continued throughout the summer, on the banks of the Rhine. The French were weakened, by detachments to their army in Flanders. The army of the empire, slow as usual in its motions, and unprovided with the means of war, were either incapable or unwilling to con∣vert to their own advantage the opportunity offered by the feebleness of the enemy. The Elector of Hannover, justly judging of the unprepared state of the Imperialists,
<PB N="402" REF="421"/>
by their unpardonable negligence in former campaigns, declined a command, in which nothing could be expect∣ed but disgrace. The war, on the side of Savoy, pro∣duced no action of any importance. The disagreement between the Emperor and the Duke still continuing, the latter refused to take the field in person. Count Thaun commanded the army. He was opposed on the side of France, by the Duke of Berwick. The vigilance, acti∣vity, and conduct of the Duke, disappointed all the ad∣vantages, which the allies might have reasonably expect∣ed from their superior force. But the discontents of the Duke of Savoy seemed to have extended themselves to his army. They were cold and languid in all their mo∣tions, and hovered, throughout the summer, on the fron∣tiers of Dauphiné, without making any effort that de∣served to be named.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Operations in Spain, battle of Almenara.</NOTE> The campaign in Spain was rendered memorable, by the alternate defeats of the two pretenders to the throne of that kingdom. Philip the Fifth, with an army con∣sisting entirely of Spaniards, took the field in the begin∣ning of May. Having passed the Segra, he sat down, on the fifteenth of the month, before Balaguer, and raised batteries against the place. But upon the approach of Count Staremberg, he repassed the river, and retired to Lerida, where he waited for a reinforcement of troops, from every side. King Charles having, in the mean time, resolved to meet his rival in the field, joined the army near Balaguer, in the beginning of June. Philip, willing to bring the contest to a decision, passed, a second time, the Segra. The two armies directing their route to Almenara, came to a battle, in the neighbourhood of that place<NOTE N="X" PLACE="foot">July 27.</NOTE>. The charge was furious on both sides; but the victory was soon decided. The cavalry of Phi∣lip were dispersed in the first shock. His infantry were driven from the field. He retired with his broken army, leaving his artillery and greatest part of his baggage to the enemy. His loss in men was inconsiderable; and he found means to collect seventeen thousand of the fugitives under the cannon of Lerida<NOTE N="Y" PLACE="foot">Hist. d'Angleterre, tom. iii.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Sarragossa.</NOTE> The rout at Almenara was but a prelude to a greater misfortune, which soon after fell on the arms of Philip the fifth. That Prince, to cut off the communication between the enemy and Castile, passed the Cinca and marched toward Sarragossa. On the eighteenth of Au∣gust, he fixed his camp within a league of that city. The count de Staremberg, one of the most able generals of the age, commanded the allies. The Marquis de Bay, being recalled by Philip from the province of Est∣ramadura, was placed at the head of the Spaniards. The first sought earnestly after an opportunity of giving battle. The latter avoided it in vain. The Spaniards were again routed, with the loss of three thousand men. They, however, found means to save their artillery and baggage, though they retired in great disorder to Tudela. The British troops, under general Stanhope, bore the chief share in a victory, which threatened to decide the fate of Spain. The victors marched streight to Madrid. Philip quitted, a second time, the capital to his rival, and retired to Valladolid. The religious enthusiasm of the Spaniards, together with a rooted aversion to the house of Austria, under whose feeble tyranny they had languished for near two centuries, was of greater benefit to Philip than their arms. They considered Charles the Third as a King imposed upon them by Heretics; and their attachment to his rival rose in proportion to his mis∣fortunes<NOTE N="Z" PLACE="foot">Hist. d'Espagne, tom. ii. &amp;c.</NOTE>. General Stanhope, who had possessed him∣self of Madrid, was better calculated to defeat an ene∣my, than to gain the affections of the vanquished. The army lived at large upon the people, without order, with∣out moderation, and without discipline. They raised contributions on private persons. They pillaged the churches, and sold publickly the utensils of the altar. The ravages of the allies combining with the obstinacy of the Spaniards, created such a dearth of provisions in Castille, that seventeen thousand men, the number of which the victors consisted, found themselves incapable of subsisting in the kingdom<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Hist. d'Angle∣terre.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. Stan∣hope taken prisoner, with 5000 British troops.</NOTE> The inconsiderate severity of the allies, contributed to increase greatly the affections of the Castilians for the

house of Bourbon. On the other hand, the Duke de Vendome, whom the caprice of the Duke of Burgundy had rendered useless to France, assumed, at the request of Philip, the chief command in Spain. The nobility crowded from every side, with their followers, round the standard of a general in whose conduct they could con∣fide. To these were joined thirty-five battalions of French foot, with twenty-eight squadrons of horse, detached from Dauphiné by the Duke of Berwick. The army under Vendôme, before the end of October, amounted to thirty thousand men. Another army of French, under the Duke de Noailles, assembled in Roussillon, were prepar∣ing to enter Catalonia. These efforts on the side of Phi∣lip, were seconded by dissentions among the allies. The latter retreated, in a kind of confusion, toward Catalo∣nia, whither Charles had already retired. They divided themselves, for the benefit of subsistence, into two bo∣dies. Staremberg commanded the most numerous, and marched in front. Stanhope, with five thousand British troops, brought up the rear. The latter stopt, on the eighth of December, at a small unfortified town called Briheuga. He was ignorant that hope gives wings to sol∣diers as well as fear. The Duke de Vendôme had swam across the Tagus with all his cavalry. He was just at the heels of Stanhope, when that general had the impru∣dence to shut himself up in full security in the village of Briheuga. He was invested, without hopes of escape, before he perceived his danger. He defended himself with great spirit. But he was at length forced to surren∣der at discretion<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">Printed accounts.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Villa-Vici∣osa.</NOTE> The Count de Staremberg, apprised of the danger of general Stanhope, returned to his relief with his whole army. But this circumstance, instead of serving the cause of the allies, was productive of fresh misfortunes. He came too late to disengage his friends. He had ad∣vanced too far to retreat with safety from his enemies. The Duke de Vendôme met the allies at Villa-Viciosa, about two leagues from the place of Stanhope's misfor∣tune. He searched for an opportunity of engaging the enemy. Staremberg could not avoid an action. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> battle was fierce, bloody, and obstinate.

with the talents of a consummate commander. Af∣ter his lest was broken and routed, he maintained the fight with a single battalion, in the midst of which he had placed himself. Night, at length, more than the efforts of the enemy, forced him to make his retreat. The field of battle, with twenty pieces of cannon, two mortars, and some waggons of provisions and ammuniti∣on, remained to Vendôme. Three thousand of the allies were slain in the action, and as many were taken in and near the field. But it was rather a retreat than a flight. Staremberg had his trophies as well as Vendôme. The honours of victory were even disputed by the former. But the progress of the Spaniards, after the action, as∣certained that their claims were better sounded. The Duke de Noailles made a considerable progress in Cata∣lonia. The efforts of the Marquis de Bay were attend∣ed with some success in Estramadura. He prevented the junction of the Portugueze with the Count de Starem∣berg, and extended his ravages and contributions into the very heart of the kingdom of Portugal<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">Hist. de Portugal, d'Angleterre, et d'Espagne.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Naval af∣fairs.</NOTE> The fleets of the maritime powers, according to cus∣tom, in the present war, cost a great deal and did little service. Their chief employment, during the summer, was the transporting of feeble succours to Catalonia and Portugal. To weaken, by making a diversion on the coast of France, the reinforcements destined to march from that kingdom to Spain, a descent was made upon the coast of Languedoc. On the twentieth of July, the confederate fleet, under Sir John Norris and the Dutch admiral Somelsdyke, sailed from Barcelona. They ar∣rived, on the twenty-fourth, before the town of Cette, which fell into their hands the next day. The Duke de Noailles, having, upon the alarm of the descent, march∣ed hastily from Roussillon, with two thousand dragoons, having each a foot-soldier behind, the enemy thought proper to quit their conquests and to re-imbark their troops. The French court, in the mean time, incapa∣ble of fitting out a fleet, permitted almost all their great ships to lie idle, under the protection of the forts which desended their harbours. The armed vessels of their sub∣jects, and a few squadrons of royal frigates, interrupted

the commerce of the maritime powers in a greater degree than in the preceding year. The merchants carried their complaints to the board of admiralty.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of the North.</NOTE> The affairs of the North, which suffered so great a change by the defeat of the King of Sweden, at the battle of Pultowa, in the preceding year, continued to wear a face of importance.

Riga surren∣dered on the eleventh of July, the fort of Dunemonde on the twelfth of August, and Revel on the first of No∣vember. The King of Denmark profiting by the mis∣fortunes of Sweden, had invaded that kingdom; and the calamity of a destructive pestilence was added to the ra∣vages of war.

The Danes were totally routed. They lost eight thousand men, besides wounded, on the field of battle.

<MILESTONE N="1710" UNIT="year"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg">State of do∣mestic af∣fairs.</NOTE> DURING the undecisive operations of the cam∣paign abroad, the state of affairs at home suffered a very important change. The Duke of Marlborough and the Earl of Godolphin, having defeated, some years before, the intrigues of Harley in the cabinet, had re∣solved to hold, by the means of party, the power which they despaired to possess by the inclination of the sove∣reign. As long as they retained the affections of the Queen, the confidence which their splendid measures had acquired from the people, were sufficient to support them against the irregular attacks of the two irreconcileable parties, that had harrassed the nation for such a number of years, with their contests and their noise. But when the violence of the Dutchess of Marlborough had destroy∣ed that influence, which she had extended into a kind of tyranny over the timid mind of her mistress, they found it necessary to strengthen themselves, by forming a con∣nexion with the Whigs. They gained, therefore, the leaders of that party, by admitting them into places of trust and profit; and, fortified, by this political alliance, they held their sovereign in chains. The Queen, unable to extricate herself from this species of captivity, affect∣ed to adopt measures which she was not permitted to guide.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Steps to∣ward a change in the ministry.</NOTE> Though Harley and the followers of his fortune were no strangers to the state of the Queen's mind, they could form no reasonable expectations, on any exertion of that Princess for the recovery of her authority. They per∣ceived, that a change in the sentiments of the people, was necessary to render effectual the efforts of the sove∣reign. The populace, for many years, had been uni∣formly gained to the views of party, by the constant alarms given, from time to time, to their zeal for the protestant religion. The Whigs, by harping judiciously on this string, had frequently taken the cabinet by storm They had often triumphed over their political opponents by the means of popular clamour, even when that party had formed a great majority in the houses of parliament<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> The Tories made repeated efforts to take possession of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> engine, that had so much annoyed themselves.

<PB N="409" REF="428"/>
propagated with great zeal, ever since the beginning of the present reign. The eloquence of the pulpit had been joined to the polemical arguments issued from the press. The established clergy themselves began, through use, to believe the doctrine which had been first propagated for the purposes of party. The vulgar gradually gave credit to what they heard so often and so vehemently urged. The Queen herself, with a credulity not unsuit∣able to her sex, was alarmed at a tale, which, she thought, was too often repeated not to have some foundation in fact.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The impru∣dence of Godolphin,</NOTE> The imprudence of the Earl of Godolphin was the means of setting fire to a train, that had been laid for se∣veral years. Persecution is always more successful than persuasion, in confirming speculative tenets in weak minds. The attack upon Dr. Sacheverell, the solemnity and length of his trial, the vast inequality between the accusers and the accused, the vehemence of the Whigs, in throwing the whole weight of government in the scale against a private person, raised the pity of the people; and that passion was improved into acts of violence, by the art, perseverance, and clamours of zealots of the high-church party. The current, which had been long changing, ran down with a force, that levelled every thing in its course. Harley and his followers added their own weight to its violence. The Queen herself, encou∣raged by the noise of the populace, fell gradually down with the stream. She had been long disgusted with the behaviour of Marlborough. She hated the tyranny and feared the violence of his wife. She considered herself <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s a kind of prisoner in the hands of a family, who had, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n a manner, cloathed themselves with the whole authority <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the crown, and struck the sceptre from her hands.

himself in the battle of Almanza. The influence of his sister, more, perhaps, than his merit, had recommended Hill to the attention of the Queen; and she shewed an inclination to raise him to the command of a regiment of dragoons, vacant by the death of the Earl of Essex. The Duke of Marlborough, who had uninterruptedly possess∣ed the disposal of all military promotions, opposed, with obstinacy, the advancement of Hill, as the brother of a woman, who had rendered herself odious to himself and his family. He retired to the country. He threatened to resign the command of the army. He employed his friends to terrify the Queen and her favourite, with ad∣dresses from the parliament. The Earl of Sunderland, the Duke's son-in-law, then secretary of state, had form∣ed a design to procure a vote of the commons, to remove Mrs. Masham from the Queen's presence and service<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Jan. 23, 1710.</NOTE>. Apprized of this intended violence, Hill entreated the Queen to desist from her purpose in his favour. She complied with his request, for the time. But it became evident, that she was resolved to seize the first favourable opportunity of ridding herself of servants whom she now considered as tyrants<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">Hist. d'Angleterre. MS. 17</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">hasten the fall of the party.</NOTE> The flame which had seized the nation, upon the trail of Sacheverell, soon furnished the enemies of the family of Marlborough with the means of divesting them of their power. Harley and his associates having free access to the Queen, through her favourite, turned events, as they gradually rose, to their own advantage. The changes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which soon after became general, were begun in the mid∣dle of April. The Duke of Shrewsbury, who had dis∣tinguished himself in the debates concerning Sacheverell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> against the ministry, was made chamberlain<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">April 14.</NOTE>, in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> room of the Earl of Kent, who had resigned that offic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon his being raised to the dignity of a Duke.

They descended from general observations on parties, to accusations of particular persons. They affirmed, that the ministry, consisting chiefly of one fa∣mily, had excluded all others from every influence and power in the state; while they held the Sovereign herself in the most abject slavery. They shewed, that naval affairs were absolutely neglected. That the war in Spain was sacrificed to the glory of the Duke of Marlborough in Flanders. That the conquests of that general produc∣ed no advantage to the nation. That his power was for∣midable, his wealth immense, his connexions extensive; and that his excessive attachment to the interests of the States of the United Provinces, founded, perhaps, on those selfish passions to which he was subject, was suffici∣ent to render him suspected of being capable of the worst designs<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">Publications of the Times.</NOTE>.</P>

The reduc∣tion of the army to a small number, upon the re-stablish∣ment of peace, would have left the kingdom in a state sufficiently defenceless to justify the minister, in entering into a treaty with a person whose claims were favoured by a very great party in the nation. The natural mode∣ration of his own character, his want of ambition, his prior engagements with Marlborough and Godolphin<NOTE N="U" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1702.</NOTE>, and even the improbability of his prevailing by force alone, would have induced the pretended Prince to accept such terms, as the Queen and the nation might choose to im∣pose. He was, by no means, so jealous as his father, with regard to the hereditary descent and indefeasible rights of the crown. He would have been well pleased to have received it as the gift of the people.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His charac∣ter.</NOTE> Had his secret designs and intrigues remained unknown to the world, the Earl of Godolphin might have been transmitted to posterity with an unblemished character. He was born with extensive talents. A long experience had, in a particular manner, qualified him for the great line of business. He understood the interests of the king∣dom, the genius of the people, the secret views of parti∣cular men, as well as the disposition of parties. In his public capacity, he was stugal of the money of the na∣tion, without cramping its exertions with penury. An oeconomist of his private sortune, without the least tine∣ture of avarice. Though forbidding in his address, through the stern gravity of an habitual silence and an ungraceful manner, he gained mankind by the apparent sincerity of his character. He never kept suitors in an unprofitable suspence. He promised nothing that he was not re∣solved to perform. He considered dissimulation as an un∣manly
<PB N="421" REF="440"/>
breach on veracity. He refused, with frankness, where he could not serve with generosity. In the com∣mon line of business he shewed such an undeviating at∣tention to justice, that those who were disappointed by his decisions, could not with-hold their esteem from his im∣partial conduct. Though he found it necessary to disguise his own principles, he never affected to possess those of others, to gain either their support or their favour. Po∣litical timidity was the greatest defect of his mind. That passion overcame frequently, in his public transactions, that sincerity which he uniformly observed in his private conduct. The weakness which induced him to adhere, in his opinions, to the excluded branch of the house of Stuart, was a kind of virtue. He was first placed in the line of fortune and ambition by that family; and their confidence in his fidelity and attachment, contributed to continue that gratitude, which he owed for their many and great favours.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Observa∣tions.</NOTE> Though the timidity of Godolphin was highly unfa∣vourable to the family of Stuart, it was also productive of bad consequences to his country.

They quitted, one by one, their places, without any con∣cert of opposition, or even design of revenge. They carried their resignations further than their enemies either expected or wished. The Queen signified her inclinati∣on, that the Lord Cowper should continue chancellor. He derived, perhaps, this favour from his insignificance.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A general ferment.</NOTE> But the people, now, were entirely on the other side. The flame, which Sacheverell's trial had raised, was kept up, with great address. The clergy, considering his cause their own, made the pulpits resound with his praise, while they thundered vengeance against his enemies. In a progress, which he made to Wales, perhaps with a de∣sign of continuing the ferment against the Whigs, he was followed, every where, by the whole country, on horse∣back. Mayors, magistrates, whole corporations attend∣ed him, in their robes and formalities, in the towns through which he passed. The populace met him on every road, with white knots in their hats, with sprigs of laurel gilt with gold, while the hedges, on either side, were dressed with flowers. Though no design of calling a new parliament was as yet made public, the reception given to Sacheverell was considered as a kind of prepara∣tion for that event. The people being, at length, pre∣pared for the measure, the parliament was dissolved, on the twenty-first of September.

The Whigs were alarmed at the credit given to their adversa∣ries, in a matter which must hurt their own influence, with a family that was one day destined to wear the crown. The Earl of Sunderland and the Lord Halifax were employed by the party to undeceive the Elector of Hannover. The avenues to the court of that Prince were so beset with the emissaries of the Tories, that the two lords were obliged to write their thoughts in cypher. They endeavoured to explain, that they had been always for a parliamentary right to the crown. They disclaim∣ed, with a degree of scorn, all republican or antimo∣narchical principles. They affirmed, that the high max∣ims of the Tories, prepared the way for the Prince of Wales to mount the throne.

The war, on the side of that kingdom, though the first object of contest, had been strangely neglected. The conduct of the allies, when most suc∣cessful, contributed to ruin the cause which they endea∣voured to support with their arms. Licentiousness and a want of regular discipline, never, perhaps, properly ob∣served in the hurry of hostilities, had been carried, by the confederates, to a degree calculated to ruin the inte∣rest of the house of Austria, in the hearts of those whom they wished to reconcile to their government. The Earl of Galway, habituated to rapine in the Irish war, was at no pains to check the natural inclination of all soldiers for plunder. General Stanhope himself, mixing a com∣mendable aversion to popery with a decent affection for bullion, had permitted his troops to pillage the altars of their sacred utensils, in the city of Madrid and its neigh∣bourhood.

The whole affection of the people was thrown into the scale of his rival; and that Prince found himself, after a war of nine years, capable to defend his crown against the united efforts of the allies. The victory at Sarragossa, being ill-pursued, opened a way for the defeat and great loss at Briheuga. The Queen laid the disasterous intelligence, which she had re∣ceived, before the two houses, who promised to support her, with all their power, to retrieve the fortune of the Spanish war. They, at the same time, entered upon an inquiry into the conduct of the late ministry, and those employ∣ed by them in Spain, in the command of the troops in that kingdom. In their approbation, as well as in their censures, on the subject, the parliament appear to have yielded, in some degree, to the spirit of party. They applauded, in a high strain, the Earl of Peterborough. But on the faults and errors of the Earl of Galway, they were, perhaps, too severe. The lords carried their ani∣madversions

from the general, to the conduct of those by whom he was employed. They addressed the Queen, to free the cabinet-council from their oath of secrecy, that a full account of their consultations might be laid before the house. The result of the whole might have been ea∣sily foreseen. A vote passed, that the former ministry were highly to be blamed, in their neglecting the Spanish war.

Though he himself had been well received by the Queen, upon his arrival from Holland, in the end of December, he found that his power had totally vanished. He had assisted at a committee of the council. But this was a matter of mere form. He was no favourite with the new ministry. He had no longer the command of the par∣liament. A motion of thanks having been made by his friends in the house of lords, it was opposed, with such vehemence, by the Duke of Argyle, that a censure was more likely to pass, than a vote of approbation. Not∣withstanding these mortifications, he resolved to retain his command. In this he yielded to the request of the allies; or, perhaps, to his love of money. Finding, however, that the aversion of the Queen to his Dutchess was not to be overcome, he carried a surrender of all her places to the foot of the throne. On the the anniversary of the birth of the Queen, he did not, as usual, appear at court.

and the state of the public debts, it appeared, that vast sums remained unprovided for in the different depart∣ments of the war. The most innocent motive to which the conduct of the late minister can be ascribed on this head is, that he wished to conceal from the nation the in∣sufficiency of the immense supplies that had been granted, to prevent a relaxation in the public ardour for the con∣tinuance of a war, which it was the chief object of the party to prolong. The enemies of the late treasurer af∣firmed, that it was to prevent an inquiry in parliament, he had encouraged the solemn prosecution of Sacheverell, as the certain means of diverting the attention of the two houses from his own conduct. The debts of the navy alone amounted to more than five millions; and near the sum of one million five hundred thousand pounds was found necessary to discharge the incumbrances of the ord∣nance and army<NOTE N="O" PLACE="foot">Journals of the Commons, March 10.</NOTE>. Over and above these prodigious sums, the commons granted to the Queen an extraordi∣nary supply of five hundred thousand pounds, for re-esta∣blishing the affairs of Spain and Portugal; four hundred and fifty thousand for giving currency to exchequer-bills; near three hundred thousand pounds for the extraordinary contingencies of the war; one hundred thousand for in∣demnifying the inhabitants of Nevis and St. Christophers, for the damage done by a French invasion of those islands; three hundred and fifty thousand pounds for building new churches; and nine thousand three hundred and seventy∣five pounds, being a subsidy due by the late King William to the Elector of Hannover<NOTE N="P" PLACE="foot">Journals passim.

The funds being so distant, the parliament engaged them∣selves to make an annual provision for the interest in the intermediate time. Together with this interest, the monopoly of a supposed trade to the South-Sea or coast of Peru in America, was granted to the proprietors. The possessors of the navy-bills, and other public securities, were incorporated for this purpose. This scheme, which was received with eagerness by the commons, flattered extremely the vanity of Harley himself. In his attention for the house of Hannover, he advised the Elector to take stock for the nine thousand pounds, due to his family of King William's subsidy. His Electoral Highness ex∣cused himself from being concerned in a mercantile com∣pany, as inconsistent with his dignity. He, at the same time, insinuated to Harley, that ready money would suit better with the state of his affairs, than any concern in public stocks and commerce; subjects which he neither studied nor understood<NOTE N="Q" PLACE="foot">Hannover-papers, 1710.</NOTE>. The proposal seems to have raised some doubts, in the mind of his Highness, whe∣ther Harley intended ever to pay the money.

To contribute to the execution of his purpose, he was placed on board the Euglish fleet, in the year 1706, when a descent, under the Earl of Rivers, was intended to be made on the coast of France. This assertor of the cause of freedom was, however, found to be such a tyrant in command, that Sir Cloudesly Shovel thought it necessary to set him on shore before the expe∣dition was laid aside<NOTE N="S" PLACE="foot">Publications of the Times.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">or Marquis de Guiscard.</NOTE> The regiment assigned to the pretended Marquis hav∣ing been cut off in the battle of Almanza, his pay, as colonel, soon after ceased. He long solicited a settled pension in vain. His profligacy having recommended him to Mr. Henry St. John, they lived together, for some time, in mutual confidence and a community of pleasures. A dispute about a mistress, or rather concern∣ing a child, which neither chose to own, had interrupted their intimacy, before St. John had been advanced, through the fall of the Whig-ministry, to the office of secretary of state. The latter, therefore, was hardly prevailed upon, by his French friend, to recommend him as an object worthy of the generosity of the crown. He, however, mentioned the case of Guiscard; and five hundred pounds a year was ordered for him, by the Queen. Harley, not only reduced the pension to four hundred pounds, but even declined to place it on any fixed establishment. The pretended Marquis endeavour∣ed to obtain redress from the Queen. But all access to her person was denied. Reduced to distress, by his pro∣fligacy, and offended at men who had been once his friends, he endeavoured to reconcile himself to his own country, by betraying to the court of France the counsels of the British ministry. He entered into correspondence with one Morreau, a banker at Paris. To cover his de∣sign, he sent his letters to Portugal, inclosed to the Earl of Portmore, who commanded the British troops in that kingdom. The Earl suspecting some treachery, opened

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He stabs Harley.</NOTE> The Marquis was apprehended in St. James's park, on the eighth of March, by virtue of a warrant from St. John, as secretary of state. Ignorant of the laws of the country, and conscious of his own crime, he thought he could not escape a death of ignominy. He fell into a fit of despair. In the midst of his disorder, he was carried to the cock-pit, before a committee of the council. Hav∣ing possessed himself, unobserved, of a pen-knife, he re∣solved to be revenged on those whom he deemed acces∣sary to his ruin. When he sound himself completely dis∣covered, by his own letters, he requested to speak aside to St. John. But the secretary suspecting his design, from the violence of his aspect, refused to comply. The Marquis approaching furiously towards the table, stabbed Harley, right in the breast, with the pen-knife. The point meeting, by accident, the bone, the blade broke short, near the handle. Guiscatd insensible of this cir∣cumstance, redoubled his blows. St. John starting, in the mean time, from his chair, drew his sword and wounded him in several places. The messengers, rush∣ing in at the noise, threw the assassin on the ground; and having bound him, carried him to Newgate, where he soon after died of his wounds<NOTE N="U" PLACE="foot">Hist. d'Angleter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> 1710.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Harley made Earl of Oxford, and lord treasurer.</NOTE> Though Harley's wound was but slight, the very at∣tempt on his life raised a kind of pity that disarmed his enemies. The commons addressed the Queen, upon the occasion, in terms highly flattering to the minister. When, after his recovery, he came first to the house, he was congratulated, at their desire, by the speaker, in a speech expressive of their high sense of his power, if not of his merit. To these testimonies of affection from the commons, the Queen added favours of a more sub∣stantial kind. She raised Harley to the double title of Earl of Oxford and Mortimer, on the twenty-fourth of May; and on the twenty-ninth of the same month, he received the white staff, as lord-high-treasurer of Grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Britain.

The adulation of men in office kept pace with his good fortune. When he took the oaths, in the court of chancery, on the first of June, Sir Simon Harcourt, the lord-keeper, addressed him, in a set speech, paying him great compliments on the antiquity of his family, his love and encouragement of letters, his great abilities in managing the finances of the kingdom, and in restoring and preserving public credit<NOTE N="V" PLACE="foot">Printed speech.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Parallel be∣tween him and the Earl of Roches∣ter.</NOTE> The death of Lawrence Hyde, Earl of Rochester, which happened on the second of May, was said to have facilitated the sudden rise of Harley to the rank of a peer and the office of lord treasurer. Though Rochester, on account of his high principles in church and state, was, by no means, agreeable to Harley; the latter found it necessary to fortify himself against the Whigs with his lordship's abilities and influence. Their characters, how∣ever, were so dissimilar, that those who knew best the secrets of the cabinet, thought they already perceived a mutual coldness. Rochester was an avowed enemy to all dissimulation. Harley threw a veil of secrecy, import∣ance, and reserve, even upon trifles. The first avowed his attachment to the Tory principles. The latter sup∣pressed his zeal for Whigism, as it might defeat his am∣bitious views. Rochester loved monarchy, and the go∣vernment of the few over the many, and avowed it to the world. Harley had a bias toward republicanism, but carefully concealed it, even from his friends. The one was haughty and overbearing, though a man of sense, experience, and abilities. The other was sensible of his own talents; but he was rather conceited than proud. though the first complied with the government, ever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ce the Revolution, he openly called that event <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ch a breach upon the constitution, as would justify, for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>er, alterations of every kind.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Coldness be∣tween Har∣ley and St. John.</NOTE> But though the death of the Earl of Rochester deli∣vered Harley from one dangerous friend, he was still con∣nected with another, who endeavoured to supplant him in his influence and power. This was Mr. Henry St. John, then secretary of state. St. John was hated by Mrs. Masham, and detested by the Queen, for the pro∣fligacy of his life. But he found means to render Harley uneasy, even in the height and plenitude of his credit and power. The slenderness of the tenure upon which he held his office, had hurt his pride. The minister having resolved upon the scheme of a peace, St. John became necessary to the accomplishment of his views. He was the only person about the court that could speak the French language<NOTE N="X" PLACE="foot">Stuart-pap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> 1714.</NOTE>. There was, therefore, a ne∣cessity for retaining him in office, to serve in the capacity of interpreter.

Without regarding his two daughters, he left his brother, Charles King of Spain, his universal heir in all the dominions of the house of Austria.

His death suddenly changed the whole state of affairs.

They knew, that France, encouraged by the death of the Emperor, would recede from the terms offered to their predecessors; and they were no strangers to the advantage which their enemies would derive from such a circumstance. They began, therefore, to feel the ground as they went, with great caution and address. The Queen, in an extraordinary message, informed her parliament of the death of the Emperor, and of her own resolution to make the election fall upon his brother, the King of Spain.

A resolu∣tion was formed, on the contrary, to prosecute the war, with still greater vigour. The minister of the late Em∣peror, those of Savoy, Portugal, and the German Princes, were all eager for a continuance of hostilities. The emoluments derived from the war, were greater than their expectations from peace. The generals, and those who furnished the troops, were equally interested, upon this subject. The first were swayed by glory, and, per∣haps, the less dignified motive of advantage. The lat∣ter yielded to profit alone. The interest of both was another name for the common cause. This was the great chain, which kept together the confederacy; and not the preservation of the balance or the liberties of Europe. The money of the maritime powers, and chiefly of England, more than the territories of the house of Bourbon, was the grand object of those petty tyrants, who fed on the blood of subjects whom they let out for slaughter.</P>

The pro¦ject

of the allies, on the side of Flanders, was to open the campaign with the siege of Arras and of Cambray. The taking of those two important places would have laid open Picardy to the banks of the Somme. The army destined, at first, for the service, might have been sufficient to accomplish that great design. But the death of the Emperor, while it hastened the approach of peace, obstructed the operations of war. A well-grounded fear, that the French and the partisans of the Electors of Ba∣varia and Cologn, might endeavour to disturb the elec∣tion of a new Emperor, obliged the Prince of Savoy to march, with the greatest part of the German troops, to the banks of the Rhine. The Mareschal de Villars, strongly posted behind his lines at Arleux, disappointed all the efforts of Marlborough, for bringing things to the decision of a battle. The Duke, on bad terms with the ministry, foresaw his own disgrace was near. He there∣fore wished earnestly, either to overwhelm his political enemies with the splendour of a great victory, or at least to retire, under the shelter of an action of renown. The strong position of the French, the resolution of their general, not to abandon the fate of the kingdom to the event of a battle, deprived the Duke of the opportunity which he so much desired. Having possessed himself of Arleux, a place considerable only from its commanding the Scarpe, he was driven from thence by the enemy. But he sat down before Bouchain, in sight of the enemy; and took that important place, on the thirteenth of Sep∣tember. The armies remained in the field, till the month of October; when the Duke closed, at once, his own military exploits and the campaign.</P>

on every side of the war. Both parties, fatigued with fruitless hostilities, seemed willing to transfer their contests from the field to the cabinet. As the death of one Prince of the house of Austria had roused all Europe to arms, so the demise of another was destined to restore it to peace. On the first of October, Charles the Third, King of Spain, was chosen Emperor by the unanimous consent of all the electors. The wretched situation of France prevented her from making the least effort against the elevationof her greatest enemy. But, had she even had the power, she ought not to have the inclination to frustrate the election. The Imperial crown seemed ac∣tually to exclude the new Emperor from that of Spain. The great motive of the war was removed, from all the confederates. It was not the interest of the German Princes to place in the hands of their master the power of oppressing themselves. It was not to be supposed, that either Britain or the States, after having expended their blood and treasure, in breaking the power of one family, would raise that of another on its ruins.</P>

France had derived nothing but an increase of demands from all the proposals she had hitherto laid before the allies. The death of the Emperor Joseph, an event of the utmost importance to the house of Bourbon, had induced the court of Versailles to remain on the de∣fensive during the campaign, and to trust their fate to the favourable circumstances which might arise in the course of time. Though the barrier had been broken, in a great measure, in Flanders, they found that the pro∣gress of the enemy could be still checked by a judicious position of their army, behind their lines. In Spain, the aversion of the people to the house of Austria, and their consequent affection for Philip the Fifth, had raised a domestic force sufficient to check, if not to disappoint all the efforts of the allies. The nation, in an uninter∣rupted series of hostilities for ten years, had caught a martial fire from their very misfortunes.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Advances made by them</NOTE> The British ministy had very early become so eager for peace, that scare any obstacle remained to obstruct their views, but a safe, secret, and sufficient way to com∣municate their sentiments to the French King. During the embassy of the Mareschal de Tallard to King Wil∣liam, one Gaultier, a priest, attended him to England, and read mass in the ambassador's chapel at London. This man, having insinuated himself into the family of the Earl of Jersey, whose lady was a Roman-catholic, re∣mained in Britain after the departure of Tallard, with a professed intention of becoming an useful spy for France, during the war which was then apprehended on account of the Spanish succession. Gaultier, regarding his own safety more than the interest of his country, gave no in∣telligence of consequence. He continued, therefore, without being suspected, in London, and divided his time between the duties of his function, in the Imperial am∣bassador's chapel, and his attention to the family of the Earl of Jersey.

But the servants of Lewis the Fourteenth, justly judging, that they had more to hope from the facility of the British ministry, than from the haughty obstinacy of the States, returned a prudent answer. They charged the Abbé Gaultier to inform the Earl of Jersey, that the King would hear no more of peace by the way of Holland.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A memorial from France.</NOTE> The Abbé having brought back to London this answer, the ministry agreed to grant the request of the court of France.

A memorial was accordingly drawn up in form, by the court of Versailles. The British ministry received it in the end of April, and transmitted it to the States, as a foundation for a general peace. The cession of Spain to the house of Austria was neither promised by France nor insisted on by Great Britain. The death of the Emperor had given a new turn to the opinions of the speculative, with regard to the balance of power.

the memorial of the court of France was too general to be admitted as a proper foundation for the renewal of the conferences, Mr. Prior was sent, in company with the Abbé Gaultier, to the court of Versailles. He was di∣rected only to communicate the demands of Great Bri∣tain, which, pursuant to the new method lately intro∣duced by the allies, were called preliminary articles. The memorial, which he presented, contained the pre∣tensions of the confederates in general, and the advantages expected in particular by the British nation. Sufficient barriers were demanded for the Empire and the States, on the side of the Rhine and in Flanders. The Dutch were to receive security for their commerce. The strong places taken from the Duke of Savoy were to be restored, and that Prince was to be permitted to possess himself of such towns and districts in Italy, as were particularly mentioned in the treaties between him and the allies<NOTE N="T" PLACE="foot">M. de Torcy, tom. ii.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">of Great Britain.</NOTE> The particular demands of Great Britain consisted in the acknowledgment of the title of Queen Anne, and the succession of the crown in the Protestant line, the demo∣lition of Dunkirk, a new treaty of commerce, the cession of Gibraltar and Portmahon, the Negro-trade in Ame∣rica, some towns, as refreshing places for the ships em∣ployed in the transportation of slaves to that part of the world. The British ministry also demanded, that the advantages in commerce already granted, or hereafter to be allowed by Spain to the most favoured nation, should be extended to the subjects of Great Britain. That France should either restore or cede the island of New foundland and Hudson's Bay and Streights. These articles were, by particular desire, to remain a profound secret, not to be revealed but by the mutual consent of the contracting parties. Three other conditions, of a more general na∣ture, were prefixed, as absolutely essential to the con∣clusion of peace. A security, that the crowns of France and Spain should never be united on the same head. That satisfaction should be given to all the allies in their just demands. That commerce should be thoroughly re-esta∣blished and permanently maintained<NOTE N="U" PLACE="foot">Report of the secret committee.</NOTE>.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Menager sent pri∣vately to London.</NOTE> The powers granted to Prior were extremely confined. He was only to communicate these preliminary demands to the French ministry, and to bring back their answer. He insisted, therefore, on a positive answer, in writing, containing an absolute consent or a downright refusal. To grant either, was deemed equally dangerous, by France. A consent would ruin the trade of that kingdom. A re∣fusal might break off the negociation, and involve the house of Bourbon in all the miseries of a war which had already been unfortunate, beyond the example of former times. To avoid those inconveniences, the French King proposed to transfer the negociations to London. He in∣formed Prior, that since he was not sufficiently authorized to treat in France, he intended, on his own part, to send a person, thoroughly instructed, to Great Britain, to treat directly with the ministry, under the immediate in∣spection of the Sovereign. Menager, deputy from the city of Rouen, was the person to whose prudence and knowledge the court of France resolved to trust this im∣portant business. The terms which Menager was in∣structed to grant, were to be confined with regard to the Empire, to a bare renewal of the treaty of Riswick. But the French King demanded, as an essential condition, the restoration of the Electors of Cologn and Bavaria to their dominions, honours, and dignities. He pretended, for himself, to the restitution of Lisle, Tournay, Aire, Bethune, and Douay<NOTE N="W" PLACE="foot">De Torcy, tom. ii.</NOTE>.</P>

One Mackay was the person, whose intemperate vigilance made this unseasonable dis∣covery.

When Prior passed clandestinely from Dover to Calais, Mackay wrote to Mr. Secretary St. John, that an English gentleman had taken his passage to France. St. John, to conceal the affair from the public, desired Mackay to keep the thing a secret, and to watch the man's return.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">by accident.</NOTE> These instructions were better followed by Mackay than St. John intended. That officious servant employ∣ed all his people, between the Forelands, to watch the return of Prior. He at length had advice that a vessel had landed at Deal, three persons with Secretary St. John's pass. He made haste to Canterbury, and met there his old acquaintance, Matthew Prior, under a feign∣ed name. Mackay dispatched immediately an express to the Duke of Marlborough, then besieging Bouchain, with this important intelligence. He informed also the Earl of Sunderland of what he had heard and seen; and that nobleman communicated to the Imperial and Dutch ambassadors, his fixed opinion, that negociations of peace were begun. Marlborough sent a copy of Mackay's let∣ter to Secretary St. John. The informer was dismissed from office. But the mischief was already done. The Imperial minister expostulated with the ministry, con∣cerning the secret negociations which were suspected to subsist between Great Britain and France. He was told, by way of answer, that he had no reason to be alarmed. That the Queen was resolved never to hearken to any terms of peace that might derogate from her engagements with her allies.

That a Prince of the house of Austria succeeding to the Em∣pire and the hereditary dominions of his family, and pos∣sessing already the Spanish territories in Italy, would be a more formidable King of Spain, than any Prince of the house of Bourbon, when excluded from the succession of France. That the balance of power in Europe would be effectually destroyed by such a measure. That the only thing to be expected, from a peace that should place Charles the Third on the Spanish throne, would be a renewal of hoftilities. That to restore the balance which such a measure must inevitably destroy, the whole fabric, built at the expence of so much treasure and blood, must be destroyed by the same hands by which it was raised. To reconcile the nation to the cession of Spain to the house of Bourbon, they affirmed, that the dependence of Philip the Fifth on French councils, would certainly cease at the death of his grandfather, an event not far distant, considering the great age of that Prince; and they closed their arguments with observing, that the total cession of the Spanish monarchy to the house of Austria, was now a thing impracticable, as that monarchy was actually dismembered, by the cessions made to the Duke Savoy, and the conquests of the British and Dutch nations<NOTE N="Y" PLACE="foot">Political Pamphlets, 1711.</NOTE>.</P>

on an occasion so critical; and they resolved to pre∣vent the very fear of danger, should the negociation prove abortive, and they themselves lose their power. But though the servants of the crown observed such caution in the negociation, they seemed determined to support the preliminary articles. On the ninth of October, a copy was delivered to the Imperial ambassador, Count Galas. That minister, with a precipitation more suit∣able to his zeal for his master than to common prudence, published the articles in a news-paper, with a view of appealing from the government to the people<NOTE N="Z" PLACE="foot">Publications of the Times, passim.

The prelimi∣naries were called captious, infidious, and insufficient; the peace to be expected from them unsafe and dishonour∣able. But neither Oxford nor his associates were now to be intimidated, from the prosecution of their pacific designs. To testify at once to the world their resolution to adhere to the preliminaries offered by France, they ordered the Imperial minister to come no more to court, and to make preparations for quitting the kingdom.

The Lord Raby, who had for se∣veral years served in the like capacity at the court of Prussia, succeeded Townshend, in the month of March.

Having been created Earl of Straf∣ford, in the beginning of September, he was ordered by the Queen to repair to Holland, to lay before the States the preliminaries which she had accepted from the court of France.

The States having had several secret conferences, declared to the British ambassador, that they found the articles so ge∣neral and obscure, that they were afraid they were ill∣calculated for serving as a foundation to a formal treaty. That, for this reason, their High Mightinesses had ap∣pointed M. Buys their envoy extraordinary, to explain to the Queen of Great Britain their sentiments and their fears upon that subject. Buys accordingly arrived in Lon∣don, on the eighteenth of October. But neither the re∣presentation of the States, nor the vehemence and in∣trigues of their envoy, were capable to change, or even to shake the resolution formed by the Queen. She or∣dered her ambassador to press the States to determine on a proper place for holding the congress. She required, at the same time, that passports should be sent immedi∣ately to the plenipotentiaries of France; and she refer∣red Buys, upon the whole, to the orders already trans∣mitted to the Earl of Strassord, at the Hague<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">Hist. d'Angleterre M. de Torcy, tom. ii.</NOTE>.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Intrigues of Buys, the Dutch en∣voy.</NOTE> This firmness of the Queen and her servants may, in some measure, be ascribed to the insolence and impru∣dence of the Dutch minister himself. He hoped to kin∣dle such a flame against the pacific intentions of the court, as might terrify them into a continuance of the war. He scarce observed common decency in his declamations against the Queen and her ministers. He represented them as traitors to their country, as enemies to the confe∣derates, and pensioners of France. He invited all male∣contents, whether British or foreigners, to his table. He used all the means which either passion or malevolence could suggest, to ruin the servants of the crown in the opinions of the nation. His chief and most intimate con∣nexion was with the Baron de Bothmar, the envoy of the Elector of Hannover. That minister, having passed from Holland to London in company with the Duke of Marl∣borough, entered into all the schemes of Buys. To in∣crease the rising clamour of the people, he presented a strong memorial against the preliminaries, in the name of his master<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">Printed Memorial.</NOTE>.

Un∣der the supposition, that the Queen was resolved not to furnish her usual proportion of the force employed in Flanders, the Dutch, in concert with the Emperor, in∣tended to seize the British troops in the Netherlands. France, informed of this design, communicated the in∣telligence to Queen Anne. But her servants were already apprized of all the clandestine machinations of their ene∣mies. They knew that the whole behaviour of the Count de Galas, and his stay in Britain, after he had been excluded from the privilege of appearing at court, were founded on a conspiracy formed at London. The real motive of his delay was to see the result of the mobish procession, for burning the Pope, the Devil, and the Pretender, which the Whigs intended to render subservient to the exciting an insurrection. The success of the project being uncertain, Galas, by the advice of the Earl of Sun∣derland, wrote for Prince Eugene, as the last resort. Un∣der pretence of paying their respects to that distinguished general, the party were to conduct him to London, with two thousand horse. His public entry was to have been on the day of the burning of the Pope and his associates.

They applied in vain to parliament. They presented a petition, to no purpose, to the Earl of Oxford.

In this report was contained the deposition of Sir Solomon Medina, charging the Duke of Marlbo∣rough, and one Cardonnel, his secretary, of various pe∣culations, with regard to the contracts for bread and bread-waggons for the army in Flanders. Marlborough endeavoured to defend himself, in vain. His passion for money was known; and his pretensions to disinterested∣ness produced no effect on the minds of the commons. The report of the commissioners was published. It was followed by accusations of various kinds. The press <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eemed with publications and pamphlets, as the Duke's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riends, as well as his enemies, made their appeal to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orld.

with security to himself, as well as with advantage to his party. He threw his whole weight into the scale against the ministry. He caballed with Buys. He courted Bothmar. He herded with the discontented of all nati∣ons. Neglecting that government of his passions, for which he had been admired by the world, he fell into all the impotencies of rage and resentment, upon every par∣ty-debate<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">Swift's sour last years.</NOTE>. He left to the Queen her choice of two alternatives. To stop the progress of the peace, to dis∣miss the ministry, and to dissolve the parliament, or to rid herself of a person, who, from a servant, was likely to become a tyrant. She determined to adopt the latter measure, and she wrote to the Duke, that she had no far∣ther occasion for his service.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cause of that mea∣sure.</NOTE> The fears of the ministry, or the designs of the Duke of Marlborough, justified the dismission of the latter in other grounds. The Earl of Oxford, perceiving the re∣fractory spirit of the house of lords, framed suddenly an expedient for gaining a majority in that assembly. On the last day of December, twelve gentlemen, devoted to the court, were created peers. The leaders of the Whigs finding that the treasurer was resolved to carry hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> measures in parliament, are said to have resolved to ap¦peal to the sword. The Duke of Marlborough havin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his commission under the great seal, the order of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Queen was not sufficient to dissolve his power.

The high sphere in which he moved, rendering him the object of envy, as well as of applause; he has been censured with virulence, by some writers, and by others extravagantly praised. The secret intrigues, and the history of his public transacti∣ons, have furnished both sides with an ample field for declamation; and there is even a peculiarity in his cha∣racter, that scarce admits of that happy medium which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies between the opposite limits of detraction and admi∣ration. Though he was born with very considerable ta∣lents, he was far from possessing those extensive abilities, which are deemed, perhaps very erroneously, essential to men who acquire the first fame in war.

He raised HIM from obscurity, to independence, to for∣tune, and to honour. He placed HIM in that only state, that could render his desertion destructive to his own af∣fairs. If his misconduct had rendered James unworthy of the returns of gratitude due to other men, why was King William also deceived<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, passim.</NOTE>? If no measures were to be kept with either of those Monarchs, why was Eng∣land betrayed to her mortal enemy<NOTE N="J" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 1694.</NOTE>? Though these questions can scarce be answered to satisfaction, they ad∣mit of alleviation. In the characters of mankind some allowances must be made for their passions and frailties. The attention to interest, which passed through the whole conduct of Marlborough, might suggest to his pru∣dence, to quit the fortunes of a man apparently destined for ruin. His spirit might induce him to oppose King William, as the cold reserve, neglect, and aversion of that Prince, might offend his pride. In this state of mind, his Lordship could hardly separate the interest of the kingdom from that of the King; and he informed the French court of the expedition against Brest, more with a design of being revenged on William, than with a view to serve France at the expence of England.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and conduct</NOTE> But if the virtues of the Duke of Marlborough were neither many nor striking, he supplied the defects of his mind with the decency of his outward carriage and the dexterity of his conduct. He possessed a solid under∣standing, a degree of natural elocution, an irresistible manner, an address which rendered mankind pleased with themselves. If not modest by nature, he assumed its ap∣pearance, with ease and dignity. He reconciled man∣kind to his fame, by affecting to be indifferent abou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> applause; and, by coming upon men in general, throug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their vanity, they were willing to give back the prais<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which he so liberally bestowed. Though he was per¦fectly master of his temper, and able to govern, or ef¦fectually to disguise his passions, he threw a kind o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pleasing vehemence into his conversation, that gave it t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> appearance of sincerity.

betrayed him into meannesses, that raised a contempt, which could scarcely be obliterated from the minds of men, by the uncommon splendour of his actions in the field. Though, perhaps, never man was more hated, he owed more to favouritism than to fortune. The af∣fection of King James had first made him an object of attention to his country. The supposed attachment of Queen Anne to himself and his family, procured for him that influence in Europe, which was the great foundation of his success<NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">MSS. passim.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">of the Duke of Marl∣borough.</NOTE> The malevolence that persecuted Marlborough through his actions in civil life, pursued the most splendid of his operations in the field. No modern general obtained greater victories, yet his conduct has been much less praised than his good fortune. Some affirmed, that he was not fond of exposing his own person, in action<NOTE N="L" PLACE="foot">Swift's four years.</NOTE>. Others said, that his apparent perturbation of spirits, in the hour of battle, was as little consistent with his usual carriage, as it was with true courage. But neither of these charges seem to be well founded. An uninterrupt∣ed chain of success, through a course of many years, cannot justly be ascribed to chance alone; and personal courage can never be denied, with justice, to a man who has been accused by his enemies to have delighted in war<NOTE N="M" PLACE="foot">Pub∣lication of the Times. Queen's speech, Dec. 7. 1711.</NOTE>. In his political capacity the Duke was certain∣ly timid. His misfortunes proceeded from that very de∣fect of his character. In his principles, for notwithstand∣ing what his enemies affirm, he had some, he was cer∣tainly a high Tory. He possessed a subserviency of man∣ner, a habit inseparable from men bred in courts, that suited the most extravagant pretensions of royalty. To this circumstance, more, perhaps, than to gratitude, ought to be ascribed his manifest attachment to the ex∣cluded branch of the family of Stuart. To a sincerity, in this respect, was owing, in fact, his continual profes∣sions to the court of St. Germains. They were, in them∣selves, neither an object of hope nor of fear; and, there∣fore, they were little calculated to gratify either ambi∣tion or avarice. He was distrusted by them, perhaps, more than he deserved. Had he been possessed of a dar∣ing
<PB N="468" REF="489"/>
boldness, suitable to his great influence, fame, and power, he might, probably, have placed the Pretender on the throne. All his passions, at length, were either subdued or extinguished by the love of money; and to that unhappy circumstance must be ascribed the ruin of his reputation. Upon the whole, if Marlborough is less to be admired than some other distinguished statesmen and generals, it is, perhaps, because his secret intrigues and actions are better known.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections.</NOTE> The fate of his reputation, after his fall, may be con∣sidered as a kind of proof, that too much was known, even THEN, of his private conduct. The news of his dismission was received like a common occurrence. No tumults, no clamours, excepting the complaints of the writers of some pamphlets, succeeded that event. The greatest subject in Europe sunk into a private station, without the sound of his fall being heard. His conse∣quence with his own party vanished with his commission. His own usual good temper forsook him with his good fortune. He became querulous, wrathful, violent, re∣vengeful. From directing the affairs of Europe, he sunk into an inferior tool of a faction.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He is un∣justly cen∣sured for prosecuting</NOTE> Though Marlborough shewed less apathy than was ex∣pected from his former character, his enemies furnished him with sufficient reasons for his resentment. The ac∣cusation which chiefly ruined his credit with the nation, now appears to have been malicious and unjust. He was said to have sacrificed the war in Spain to his own ope∣rations in Flanders, to gratify his ambition, and to glut his inordinate avarice. His enemies in parliament, al∣luding to the strength of the French barrier, made use of a vulgar phrase, which made a great impression on a peo∣ple who were heartily tired of the war. They said, that to endeavour to subdue France, by attacking her strong towns on the side of Flanders, was taking the bull by the horns. That, instead of expelling Philip the Fifth from Spain, the troops and treasure of the confederates were thrown away on unimportant sieges, and attacks upon almost impregnable lines. That the Prince of Savoy, himself, as he profited, like Marlborough, by hostilities in Flanders, had contrived to unite with him in influ∣encing, through the pensionary Heinsius, the councils of the States; and that all the three meant nothing by the undecisive campaigns in Flanders, but to protract their own power, which was likely to terminate with the war.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">the war in Flanders.</NOTE> There is nothing, however, more certain, than that to push France, on the side of Flanders, was the infal∣lible way of depriving the house of Bourbon of the crown of Spain. The war, in the latter kingdom, had been carried on, always, with a degree of spirit, and often with great success. But, at the end of ten years, Philip the Fifth was more firmly established on the throne, than at the beginning of the contest. The distance of the consederates from the place of action, the necessity of conveying every thing by sea, the sterility of the coun∣try itself, the indolence of the inhabitants, which de∣prived their enemies, as well as themselves, of the ne∣cessaries of war, the religious prejudices of the native Spaniards, against a Prince, supported by troops whom they called Heretics, had all combined to confirm the

He was in the same awkward predicament
<PB N="472" REF="493"/>
with his predecessor in office. Both were forced to adopt a line of conduct diametrically opposite to their principles and views. The Earl of Godolphin, though a Tory and Jacobite, was obliged, from the circumstances of the times, to place himself at the head of the Whigs. The present treasurer, though a Presbyterian, and attached to the house of Hannover, was considered as the leader of the Tories, and a favourer of the claims of the Pretender. The bulk of mankind, ever deceived by out∣ward shew, judged of the two ministers by their own pas∣sions and prejudices. Godolphin, when in correspondence with the court of St. Germains, was violently praised by many, and as extravagantly condemned by others, for his attachment to the Protestant succession. Oxford was still more unfortunate than his rival. He was supposed, by the court of Hannover itself, as well as by the people, a determined friend to the excluded family; even when he used all his efforts against their eventual restoration, and laid himself in the dust at the feet of the parliament∣ary heirs of the crown, his professions were considered as so many baits to deceive. But, in a happy enthusiasm for his own religious opinions, or, perhaps, ultimately to gain the favour of that family most likely to succeed, he seemed determined to exclude all resentment, and to shew that he was a much more sincere friend than his adver∣saries to the succession of the Electoral family.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He disco∣vers by an accident,</NOTE> In this disposition of mind, the Earl of Oxford was as much afraid of the Tories, as he was of the principal Whigs. His great desire, when he assumed the admini∣stration of affairs, was to retain the most moderate of the low-church party in office. The violence of his friends, as well as the rage of his enemies, put an end, for a time, to this trimming scheme. To balance, in some degree, the vehemence of the high-church party, he wished to keep Marlborough at the head of the army<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, Feb. 1712.</NOTE>. An in∣cident, however, defeated all his present schemes, while it proved fortunate for his future conduct. Though he had entered, with such an appearance of firmness and zeal, into the scheme of making peace with France, his courage failed him when the Whigs began their clamours against the preliminaries. He therefore endeavoured, by
<PB N="473" REF="494"/>
large promises, to gain the Emperor to his measures, through his ambassador at London. That minister, how∣ever construing Oxford's advances to his inability of sup∣porting himself, advised his master to reject his proposals, and to adhere to the Whigs. He affirmed, that there was no reason to apprehend the Tories durst conclude a separate peace with France, or offend the populace by giving jealousy to the confederates. He proposed at the same time, that to amuse the people of Great Britain, large promises should be made by the Emperor, for con∣tinuing, with redoubled vigour, the war. This measure, he said, would either persuade or terrify the British mi∣nistry to put an end to the negotiations of peace; assuring his master, that ways and means could be afterwards found for evading his engagements with credit<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1712.

Being known to one Netterville and to Pen, the noted Quaker, he informed the Earl of Oxford, by their means, of the discoveries he had made. He placed the papers, to the number of twenty-four, in his hands. Among other matters of im∣portance, they contained the resolution of the Duke of Savoy to adhere to the pacific measures of Queen Anne; together with a letter from the King of Portugal to the Emperor, importing, that he was resolved to put an end, on his part, to the war. They contained also a scheme for dethroning the Queen; and another, in case that should sail, for continuing the war for two years.

Queen's ministers, endeavoured to gain him over to the interests of the Pretender. But the Whigs having form∣ed many visionary projects for disappointing the peace, the Count resolved to adhere to their party. Plunket having failed in gaining his favour, resolved to alarm his fears. He told him, that a design was on foot for mar∣rying the Pretender's sister to Charles the Twelfth of Sweden. That Charles, from a prospect of the succession to the British crown in the right of his intended spouse, would assist the Pretender with a Protestant army. That there would be no difficulty in transporting troops from Sweden to Scotland; and that a Prince of Charles's high military reputation and genius, would find little difficulty in establishing his brother-in-law in a kingdom where he had so many and so zealous friends. The ambassador carried this intelligence to the Whigs. They were alarmed beyond measure. They sent to the court of Hannover for an agent capable of supporting, in concern with themselves, the interests of the Electoral family. The Baron de Bothmar arrived, accordingly, in London, in the month of November, in company with the Duke of Marlborough; and the memorial, presented in the name of the Elector, against the peace, was the result of conferences between the ministers of that Prince and the leaders of the Whig-party<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1713.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Oxford's prudence.</NOTE> Had not the attachment of the Earl of Oxford to the Electoral family interfered, this measure might have proved fatal to the succession, according to the act of set∣tlement. The whole body of the Tories, the house of commons, and, above all, the Queen herself, were to the last degree offended. The Dukes of Buckingham and Shrewsbury, together with the majority of the cabi∣net-council, proposed to send Bothmar, in the custody o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a messenger, out of the kingdom<NOTE N="E" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1713.</NOTE>.

the Whigs. That the Jacobites would turn insolent; and that, in short, the whole kingdom would become a scene of anarchy and confusion. The Whigs perceiving that Bothmar's memorial produced no effect, flew, with the usual vehemence of party, into another scheme. They sent to the Prince of Savoy to come immediately to London. The object of his journey was to lay before the Queen and the parliament the necessity of continu∣ing the war. He was also to provide himself with proofs, that France had bought peace from the British court, for money. Upon this accusation the Whigs, having a majority in the house of lords, were to send two or three of the cabinet-council to the Tower. Plunket, having received intelligence of these schemes from his friend, the Emperor's agent, then at the Hague, conveyed the whole to the Earl of Oxford<NOTE N="F" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1713.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Whigs send for Prince Eugene. His charac∣ter.</NOTE> Though the intelligence furnished by Plunket, was the principal reason for the resolute measures of the Earl of Oxford, he owed the preservation of his power, and, perhaps, ultimately his life, to the happy, but unac∣countable delay of Prince Eugene. Though a caution, which his enemies called political timidity, might pre∣sent the Duke of Marlborough from adopting violent measures, there was no security against the schemes of the Prince: A man of great abilities, unconfined by prin∣ciple, sanguine in his views; as determined in the ex∣ecution of his designs, as he was bold in undertaking the most desperate measures. He kept one great object, his own ambition, perpetually in view. He pushed forward, in one direct line, to that distinguished point. He re∣garded obstacles only as to their difficulty of being re∣moved. He valued little the means he used; as he was taught by his pride that every thing calculated to extend his own greatness was allowable, if not just. In this dis∣position of Eugene's mind, the only safety of the ministry consisted in his absence from London. But the slow counsels of the house of Austria proved, according to custom, highly favourable to their enemies. The Prince was detained at the Hague, till the season of his being useful in London was past. The Earl of Oxford, ap∣prized of the designs of his enemy, had time to fortify
<PB N="476" REF="497"/>
himself against his attacks; and thus, by the inconti∣nence of a secretary, and the address of an obscure Jesuit, much mischief was prevented, and Europe ultimately restored to tranquillity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A majority made in the house of lords.</NOTE> The Earl of Oxford, long perplexed with difficulties, became at length resolute, through his very fears. He dismissed the Duke of Marlborough from all his employ∣ments. But this measure was not sufficient to secure him against the designs of the Whigs. Though the house of commons were subservient to his wishes, there was also a necessity of gaining a majority to the measures of the court in the house of lords. The excluded party had acquired courage, as well as reputation, under the ap∣probation of one branch of the legislature. To deprive them of that advantage, was to pursue with effect the victory already gained by the ministry, by the removal of the Duke. A sudden resolution was taken to command the deliberations of the house of lords, by the creation of twelve new peers. The measure was deemed arbitrary and dangerous; but it could not be called illegal. It served only to shew the party, that an opposition is form∣ed in vain against the crown, in an assembly whose num∣ber of members depends on the will of the Prince. The lords having met on the second of January, the new peers were introduced. They had scarce taken their seats, when they were called upon service. A motion was made to adjourn the house to the fourteenth of the month, the day to which the commons had adjourned. Upon a divi∣sion, the majority for the court appeared to be thir∣teen<NOTE N="G" PLACE="foot">81 against 68.</NOTE>. The violence of the party increased with this reverse of fortune. Though the means used to defeat their efforts in the house of lords were obvious, and might have been foreseen, they had derived hopes that the pre¦rogative could not be exerted, from the timid characte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Queen<NOTE N="H" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1711.</NOTE>.</P>

The Prince obtained an audience of the Queen; but he was coldly, though politely, received. She re∣ferred him for business to Oxford and St. John, the only persons present at their interview. The Whigs were much elevated at the arrival of his Highness, in a con∣juncture so critical to their affairs. Even such Tories as carried their principles to the height of Jacobitism were not displeased. They were no strangers to the principles, or rather the views, of the Earl of Oxford, in favour of the family of Hannover. They knew, that to defeat the peace was to ruin the minister. Nothing but the fear of falling into the hands of the Whigs had induced them to support the court. Had the leaders of the latter party followed a more moderate line of conduct, the Earl of Oxford must have fallen by the hands of his supposed friends. In the preceding autumn, the adherents of the excluded family had discovered, that they could form no hopes to their cause on the favour of the lord-treasurer. Neither the Queen, nor her favourite, now Lady Masham, were ignorant of this circumstance; but both dreaded what they called the tyranny of the Whigs, should the lord-treasurer, by the desertion of the Tories, be forced to resign.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His projects.</NOTE> The Prince of Savoy had formed no doubt of being able to defeat the treaty of peace, by embarrassing the British ministry with splendid offers of advantage for con∣tinuing the war. He had resolved to propose, in the name of the Emperor, to leave Great Britain in absolute possession of the commerce of Spain and America; to in∣duce the King of Denmark and the Czar of Muscovy to join in the grand confederacy; to make up the Imperial forces in Spain to thirty thousand men; to pay one mil∣lion of crowns, out of four, to be expended in the mili∣tary operations on that side. Should either house of par∣liament accept these terms, in opposition to the ministry, the Elector of Hannover was to have passed into Great Britain with an army<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot">De Torcy, tom. ii.

favour of that Prince would enable him to carry on the war to the last extremity against the house of Bourbon. But when Prince Eugene perceived, that the commons were firm in their support of the ministry; that a majo∣rity had been secured in the house of lords; that the Duke of Marlborough was disgraced, and rendered inca∣pable to second his views; that the Whigs, though obsti∣nate in their opposition, were divided in their councils; that men of influence and property were inclined to a peace; that the mob of London were only clamorous for war; he resolved to spare no sort of violence to accom∣plish his views.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Schemes of Marlbo∣rough,</NOTE> In forming his measures, the Prince of Savoy resolv∣ed to consult chiefly the Duke of Marlborough and the Baron de Bothmar, the Hannoverian envoy extraordinary at the court of London. The Duke, at their first inter∣view, chided the Prince for the unfortunate delay in his journey. His arrival, he said, might have been of great advantage to the party, about a month before. He ascribed his dilatoriness to that Austrian gravity which had been often fatal to the affairs of the Imperial family. He told him, that, at the opening of the session, their friends had a majority in the house of lords. That they could have sent two or three of the opposite party to the Tower, without any difficulty. That their vacant places might be supplied with men willing to continue the war. That now the whole state of affairs was changed; that twelve new peers had been created; that the Scotish peers were arrived; that they must have recourse to violence, or drop altogether their design; that three or four per∣sons, together with the lord-treasurer, who possessed the confidence of a silly woman<NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">Hannover-papers, 1712.</NOTE>, and governed her at pleasure, must be removed. That the Prince must, in the mean time, behave himself with great moderation and discretion. That he should endeavour to gain the good opinion of the minister, and induce the commons to grant ample supplies; and that the whole party should watch such accidents as might arise in the progress of time<NOTE N="L" PLACE="foot">M de Torcy, tom. ii. Stuart-papers, 1712.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="479" REF="500"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">and of the Baron de Bothmar.</NOTE> The Duke descended from these particular facts to reflections more general. He affirmed, that the state of the kingdom at present resembled its situation at the late Revolution; that the disorders were similar, and demand∣ed the same remedies; that should a Prince of the Elec∣toral family appear in Great Britain, under the cover of a manifesto, setting forth, that the Pretender was coming with a Popish army, the mob might be deceived, and Queen Anne, like her father, would steal away to France. That then the crown might be settled by the Whigs, and the war be carried on with redoubled vigour. These observations devolved the discourse on the Baron de Both∣mar. He averred, that though the disorders might be the same, the same remedies were impracticable; that the nation was not sufficiently prepared for a revolution; that the prejudices of the vulgar, the great engine in such daring enterprises, were still upon the side of the enemy; that though the Queen was suspected of favouring a Po∣pish successor, she herself was a strict Protestant; that the jealousy concerning religion was too feeble, on account of the distance of the danger; that though circumstances had even been more favourable, the experiment would be extremely dangerous; that a miscarriage would inevi∣tably ruin the undertaking, load the family of Hannover with the public hatred, and exclude them from the suc∣cession to the crown. The Duke of Marlborough suffer∣ed himself to be argued out of his observations by the elo∣quence of the Baron de Bothmar. But he is said to have proposed another project, more safe, and equally effec∣tual. He suggested, that bands of ruffians should be sent through the streets by night, to insult the inhabi∣tants, to raise disturbances, and to excite mobs. That, should people become accustomed to these nocturnal alarms, there would be no difficulty in assassinating such persons as the party might wish to remove, and to throw the whole blame on a licentious band<NOTE N="M" PLACE="foot">Mem. de Torcy, tom. ii. Stuart-papers, 1713.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince Eu∣gene's vio∣lent propo∣sal.</NOTE> Though Prince Eugene rejected this project, his own was not distinguished with more humanity. He proposed to set fire to London, in different places, in the night; particularly to the palace of St. James's, where the Queen resided. He shewed, that the proper time for
<PB N="480" REF="501"/>the execution of this design was when the guards on duty were commanded by an officer whom the party could trust. That, in the midst of the confusion, the Duke of Marlborough should appear at the head of a party in arms. That he should first possess himself of the Tower, the Bank, the Exchequer. That then he should seize the person of the Queen, force her to dissolve the parlia∣ment, to call a new representative, to make a free in∣quiry into the clandestine correspondence with France, to punish the guilty with death<NOTE N="N" PLACE="foot">Mem. de Torcy, tom. ii. MSS. passim.</NOTE>. The Lords Somers, Cowper, and Halifax, were consulted upon this scheme. They refused at first to declare their own opinion; but they at last absolutely rejected the violent proposal of the Prince. They signified their inclination to proceed in the legal and ordinary way. They advised Bothmar to present a second memorial, in the name of his master, more clear, more positive, and more comprehensive, than the former. But though Bothmar agreed to all the schemes, in which the Whigs were only concerned, he shrunk back when it became his own part to act. He told them, that, by presenting such a memorial, without the express orders of the Elector, he should risk his head. That therefore, he was resolved to extend his aid no farther, than to compose a writing, containing the strongest expressions against the peace; and that this anonymous paper should be printed in Holland, and published and dispersed in London<NOTE N="O" PLACE="foot">Ibi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/></NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His further schemes dis∣appointed.</NOTE> Disappointed in his views, by the caution of the Whigs and the timidity of Bothmar, the Prince of Savoy laid before his party another plan. He proposed that the Elector of Hannover should be appointed commander in chief of the troops in Flanders, and governor-general in the Netherlands; that to strengthen the Whigs, the Electoral Prince should pass into England, to awe the ministry, by appearing at the head of their enemies. Marlborough and Godolphin opposed this measure wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> great vehemence. They affirmed, that the Tories, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a man, were enemies to the Electoral family; tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> should the Prince of Hannover come over whilst they ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in possession of the government, the abrogation of the act of settlement would be the necessary consequence; an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

that a civil war might arise, perhaps, as fatal to the na∣tion as that between the houses of York and Lancaster. But the Duke of Marlborough was urged by stronger motives than the miseries to be entailed on his country. The credit of his enemies daily increased. His own de∣clined. He had already felt a change of fortune. He was afraid of further vicissitudes. The Emperor had provided him with an estate in Germany, out of the spoils of the Elector of Bavaria. He had dignified him with the title of Prince. But though this settlement had secured a quiet retreat, it' was not sufficient to satisfy his ambition. He had turned his eyes to the command of the Imperial troops in Flanders, with the title of Vicar-General of that country. He, therefore, could not ap∣prove of a project that placed the Elector in a station which he wished to obtain for himself<NOTE N="P" PLACE="foot">Mem. de Torcy, tom. ii. MSS. passim.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Disgusted with the conduct of the Whigs.</NOTE> The Prince, enraged at the difficulties raised against all his projects, declared, that he perceived the Whigs were no more friends to the house of Hannover, than the Tories.

On the anniversary of the Queen's birth<NOTE N="T" PLACE="foot">Feb. 17.</NOTE>, they took every precaution for the security of her person. The guards were doubled. The gates of St. James's were shut. Several parties of horse were stationed in the neighbour∣hood.

They were informed, that, under the pretence of a tu∣mult among the populace, some persons, employed by the Prince and his party, were to force their way to the Earl of Oxford, and to assassinate him, together with Mr. St. John, and the lord-keeper, Sir Simon Harcourt. The Queen was terrified beyond measure. Oxford, to protect himself and to encourage his mistress, occupied apartments in the palace. The lord-keeper and the se∣cretary took care not to venture abroad after it was dark. But, amidst this alarm, the minister and his threatened associates conducted themselves with commendable pru∣dence, in concealing their apprehensions of danger. Had they carried the intelligence they had received to the council at large, or, above all, had it been laid before the parliament, the nation might have been kindled into a degree of frenzy against the projectors of such danger∣ous schemes. The imprudence of the Baron de Both∣mar, in being privy to these consults, might have even endangered the succession in the Protestant line.

principles to pass without being laid before the parliament. Though the proofs furnished by Plunket and others were sufficient to convince mankind of the reality of a conspi∣racy, they were not deemed complete, in the eye of the law. Oxford endeavoured to conceal even from the ca∣binet-council the informations he had received against the Prince of Savoy. He subjected them, however, to the inspection of the Queen. Plunket, thinking that Eu∣gene should be committed to prison, had sent a detail of the whole, by the hands of the Earl of Yarmouth, to the Duke of Buckingham, and to Harcourt, the lord-keeper. They laid it instantly before the rest of the cabinet. The Earl of Oxford was alarmed. He knew their principles, and he was afraid of their violence. He entreated them to make no motion in the business. They affirmed, that the thing concerned them too nearly to be dropt without examination. They ordered Plunket to appear; but Oxford carried him first to Queen Anne. The Duke of Buckingham brought him before the cabinet. He was examined with strictness. They promised to provide for him, during life, for his services.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They are prevented by Oxford.</NOTE> The Earl of Oxford opposed this measure with various arguments. He said, that to employ a Roman Catholic upon that service, would furnish the Whigs with a popu∣lar ground for clamour. That the scrutiny into their con∣duct would offend the Allies, in a degree that might prove extremely dangerous. That a court that would expose such secrets to parliament could never afterwards be trust∣ed. That the differences which must ensue between the confederates and the court of London would enable France to prescribe her own terms; and that Great Britain, from being the umpire of the affairs of Europe, would sink into contempt. These solid reasons were, howe∣ver, rejected. The principles of Buckingham overcame the art of Oxford. Plunket was sent to Holland. He pre∣vailed with his friend to consent to come to England, upon

the promise of a provision for life: but he insisted to have that promise under the hand of the secretary of state. Though the affair belonged properly to the secretary's office, the Earl of Oxford took the whole into his own department. Plunket informed him of the German agent's demands; but he kept the letter from the inspection of the cabinet-council. He, in the mean time, amused Plunket, and contrived to employ him in Holland, as the only means to prevent the cabinet-council from making public this disagreeable and dangerous affair<NOTE N="V" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers. 1713.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His artful and cauti∣ous conduct.</NOTE> The Earl of Oxford, through the whole of this trying scene, behaved like a man whose passions lay subdued by his principles. Though he was no stranger to the designs of his enemies against his mistress, though he was inform∣ed of their schemes against his own person, though those who supported his measures upbraided him for his conduct, he proceeded, considering his situation, with great mode∣ration and circumspection. The violence of the Whigs, more than the vehemence of the Tories, had forced him into the measures, of which the first of those parties so much complained. He was unwilling to disgrace Marl∣borough. He was equally averse from persecuting that nobleman in parliament. When the commons, swayed by Tory-principles, animadverted upon the Duke and his adherents, the Earl of Oxford had proofs in hands against them, that would infallibly ruin their reputation with the people, and might even endanger their lives.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceedings of the com∣mons.</NOTE> During these secret intrigues, dangerous conspiracies, and clandestine designs, the parliament proceeded along the obvious line of public business. The two houses hav∣ing met on the fourteenth of January, were required, by a message from the Queen, to adjourn themselves further to the seventeenth of the month. Her Majesty ordered the secretary of state to acquaint the commons, that her plenipotentiaries had arrived at Utrecht, and had already opened the conferences for the speedy re-esta∣blishment of the public tranquillity. That to secure the conclusion of peace, by appearing provided for war, all preparations were made for opening an early campaign. She therefore requested the house to give the necessary dispatch to the supplies. She concluded with complaining of the licentiousness of the press, which was become too great to be restrained by the laws in force; and she recom∣mended to the house to find a remedy equal to the mischief. The answer of the commons was suitable to their prin∣ciples, and their usual obsequiousness to the views of the Queen. They thanked her for her promise to commu∣nieate to them the terms of the peace. They reflected on such persons as had spread groundless and malicious reports against her councils. They promised dispatch in the supplies.

Upon the oath of one of his agents it appeared, that Walpole had received five hundred guineas, and a note for five hundred more, for two contracts, made by him when secretary at war, for supplying the troops in North Britain with forage. Though the shameful venality of this man deserved pu∣nishment, his connexion with the former ministry was more the object of resentment than his offence. He was expelled from his seat in the house and committed to the Tower<NOTE N="Y" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. The commons passed from the affair of

Robert Walpole to a censure on the Duke of Marlbo∣rough. Upon examining the charge against that noble∣man, for having taken money of the contractors for bread and bread-waggons, and for deducting for his own use two and one half per cent. from the pay of the foreign troops in Flanders, in the pay of Great Britain, they came to a resolution, that the Duke, in receiving those sums, had been guilty of unwarrantable and illegal practices. Their vote was laid by the whole house before her Majesty. The attorney-general was directed to prosecute the duke. But either no prosecution was ever commenced, or it was carried on with a languor that defeated its design. To throw disgrace on Marlborough was more the object of the minister than the refunding of the public money.

The Viscount Townshend, whom Marlborough, had associated with himself in the negociations for peace in 1709, had con∣cluded a treaty with the States of the United Provinces, with regard to a barrier in Flanders for the Dutch at the end of the war. In concluding this treaty, Townshend, in a compliance with the views of his party, had exceed∣ed his instructions. Lisle, Tournay, Menin, Douay, and several places on the Lys and the Scheld, were gua∣ranteed to the States. The most of those cities were in themselves an essential barrier to France.

The Baron de Bothmar, with his usual imprudence, made his master a party in favour of the treaty. He wrote in vehement terms to Mr. Secre∣tary St. John<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">Printed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE>. He threatened several members of the lower house with the resentment and vengeance of the Elector, should they proceed to censure the per∣sons concerned. Though this conduct could scarce be supposed to proceed from instructions from Hanno∣ver, the enemies of that court improved the circum∣stance to favour their own views. The more credulous part of the commons were induced to believe the sug∣gestions of an intended invasion, and the reports of a de∣signed revolution. The most spirited were offended at this unseasonable interference with the resolutions of a body who had a right to be independent of every exter∣nal power. When therefore the affair of the bar∣rier came to the vote, the commons resolved, that se∣veral articles of the treaty were destructive to the trade and interest of Great Britain. That the Lord Townshend had neither orders nor authority to conclude these perni∣cious articles. That therefore he who negociated and signed the treaty was an enemy to the Queen and king∣dom. The States interfered in vain in a letter to the Queen herself<NOTE N="E" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.

the Emperor, in particular, who had most to gain by the was, contributed the least towards its expence. That the States of the United Provinces had not come up in any article to the terms of their treaties. That the King of Portugal and the Duke of Savoy made a lucrative trade of the war, by extracting from their friends the advan∣tages which they ought to conquer from their enemies. The Commons came to various resolutions on this impor∣tant subject. The Princes and States who composed the confederacy were treated with great freedom in the de∣bates. The complaints of their respective ministers were joined by the clamours of the excluded party. They af∣firmed, that the Emperor, who was the acknowledged head of the alliance, was attacked with unbecoming dis∣respect. That the Duke of Savoy, to whose spirit and activity the allies owed the conquest of Italy, was un∣worthily treated. That the States, the faithful allies, and even the benefactors of the British nation, were in∣sulted; and all this to facilitate a dishonourable treaty, to please a faithless enemy, who presumed to dictate the terms of peace, after having been almost totally subdued in the war<NOTE N="F" PLACE="foot">H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st d'Angleterre.

The peers having adjourned the business from day to day, seem∣ed at length, by dropping their debates without coming to a decision, to adhere to their former resolution.

To preserve appearances, Mr. Secretary St. John was com∣manded to lay before the house of commons a propositi∣on made by the Prince, in the name of his Imperial Ma∣jesty, for the support of the war in Spain.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Congress opened at Utrecht.</NOTE> During these transactions in the British parliament, the conferences for restoring peace to Europe were opened at Utrecht. The plenipotentiaries of Great Britain and France, together with those of the States, met, in form, for the first time, on the eighteenth of January. Though the Earl of Strafford and the Bishop of Bristol had received orders to hasten the great work of peace, they were not suf∣ficiently instructed with regard to the article of Spain, which must necessarily form the foundation of the treaty. This secret was reserved by the ministry for Mr. Prior, who was expected in quality of third plenipotentiary from Great Britain. The British plenipotentiaries, confined in their powers, conversed still with those of France, in the stile of enemies. They declared, that the articles signed by Menager ought rather to be considered as pro∣positions than preliminaries. That they were neither binding on the Queen nor considered, in the least, as binding on the allies. This declaration composed, in some degree, the spirits of the confederates. The Em∣peror himself consented to send plenipotentiaries to Utrecht The peace depended not on that Prince, though the war had been undertaken in his cause. The confederates, as well as the French, perceived, that the fate of the treaty was involved in the resolutions of the Queen of Great Britain. But an unexpected incident threw, to an un∣certain distance, the tranquillity that was suddenly ex∣pected by all the belligerent powers.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of the Princes of France.</NOTE> In the month of April of the preceding year, the Dauphin of France, the only son of Lewis the Four∣teenth, died, at the age of fifty.

an idle report. But the profligate pleasures of that Prince had induced mankind to form the worst opinion of his morals. Out of three sons born to the Duke of Burgun∣dy, the Duke of Anjou, a sickly infant, only remained. The misfortunes of France raised the courage of such of the confederates as were eager for continuing the war. The Emperor rose in his hopes, and increased his demands. The States grew more obdurate. The Bri∣tish ambassadors became more cool in their zeal. The ministry either did not chuse or durst not send Prior, as third plenipotentiary, to Utrecht. They concurred with the rest of the confederates, in demanding new precau∣tions for the stability of the peace, and for preventing the crowns of France and Spain from being joined on the head of the same Prince<NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">Mem. de Torcy, tom ii. Swift's four years.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Alternatives offered by Great Bri∣tain.</NOTE> Notwithstanding these demands, on the part of Great Britain, the ministry made no secret of their resolution to conclude a peace. The lord-treasurer dispatched a Mr. Harley, a relation of his own, to Utrecht. He directed the Abbé Gaultier, who still resided in London, to pro∣pose different alternatives, out of which the French King might form a proposal, that ought to satisfy the allies of Great Britain. Harley was charged with the like com∣mission. The plenipotentiaries stopt the progress of the conferences. They said, that he had brought such or∣ders as would break off all negociation, unless the court of France should agree to one of the alternatives offered by the Abbé Gaultier, in the name of the Queen of Great Britain. The memorial of Gaultier represented the just alarm of Europe, should the person who was actually King of Spain ever ascend to the throne of France. He shewed that this danger was far from being chimerical, as this Prince was so near the succession of the latter king∣dom. That the only way to prevent the danger appre∣hended by the confederates, was for Philip the Fifth to transfer his right to the Duke of Berry. That, with∣out this expedient, neither the British nation, nor their allies, would ever consent to a peace which would be, in that case, not only unsafe but impracticable<NOTE N="L" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arguments of the French King May.</NOTE> The French King was embarrassed by an incident which he had actually foreseen. He endeavoured to elude the demands of the court of Great Britain. To accomplish his purpose, he advanced all the trite argu∣ments used by casuists, in defence of the hereditary de∣scent of the crown. In a letter to the British ministry, he affirmed, that the King, though supreme lord of his dominions, has not the power of altering their funda∣mental laws. That the prince next to the crown was the necessary heir. That his right is an inheritance which he receives neither from his predecessors nor the people, but from the law. That, when one King dies, another succeeds, without asking the approbation or re∣quiring the consent of any person. That he succeeds, not as heir, but as master of the kingdom; the sovereign∣ty of which belongs to him, not by choice, but by birth∣right. That he is obliged, for his crown, to no will of a prior king, to no edict, to no liberality in another per∣son, but to the law. That this law is esteemed the work of HIM who establishes monarchies. That God alone can break this first link in the chain which binds together the community. That this law can neither be invalidated by agreement, nor rendered void by renun∣ciation. That, should the King of Spain renounce his right, for the sake of peace, that act would only deceive himself and disappoint the allies<NOTE N="M" PLACE="foot">De Torcy, tom. ii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Concerning hereditary right.</NOTE> Mr. Secretary St. John corresponded with the court of Versailles upon this subject. He returned an answer less complicated and more decisive. He admitted, that the French nation might hold, that God alone can abolish the law of succession. But that in Britain most men were of another mind. That the most scrupulous, on this delicate subject, believed that a prince might forego his right, by a voluntary resignation. That the person in whose favour the renunciation was made might be justly supported by the princes who should happen to be gua∣rantees of the treaty. That, in short, the Queen of Great Britain would put an end to all negotiation, unless the French should accept of the expedient proposed. That it was neither her design nor inclination to deprive Philip either of the title or power of King. That she

wished, upon his resignation of the crown of Spain, to preserve his right to that of France, and to place him on another throne. That Naples, the territories of Savoy, the duchies of Montferrat and Mantua, should be erected, for him, into a kingdom.

King of Spain re∣nounces his title to the French crown.</NOTE> Though the French King amused St. John with argu∣ments in favour of hereditary right, he wrote to his grand∣son to desire him to accede to the proposals of Great Britain. That Prince, after a delay suitable to the gra∣vity of Spanish councils, resolved to renounce his precari∣ous prospect of the crown of France, for the certain pos∣session of the throne of Spain. The Queen of Great Britain, impatient, for various reasons, for peace, order∣ed the Earl of Strafford to return to London. The avowed object of his journey was to receive his ultimate instructions to conclude the treaty, as soon as the King of Spain's answer should be received. When his answer was, accordingly received, in the beginning of June, the Queen agreed to a suspension of arms. The conditions of this indulgence to France, was the immediate delivery of Dunkirk to the British troops; and the punctual exe∣cution of the article concerning the union of France and Spain. She proposed, at the same time, that a Dutch garrison should be introduced into Cambray. The French King, deriving spirit from her eagerness, rejected this demand with a degree of disdain. He declared, that he would rather refuse the cessation of hostilities, and put an end to all negociation, than admit a clause so contrary to his own honour and the interest of his kingdom. The Queen, anxious for peace, receded from her demand.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cause of the anxiety of Anne for a peace.</NOTE> France owed a change so great and so unexpected, to favourable accidents more than to her own policy and intrigues. Though the British ministry had long per∣ceived, that they must either relinquish their power or conclude a peace, their late vehemence, in carrying on the negociations, proceeded from their fears rather than from ambition. The Queen, herself, frightened at the real or supposed conspiracies of the Whigs, was anxious to end the war. The support given by the confederates to a party whom she dreaded, threw her inclinations in the scale of France; and she seemed even willing to de∣rive protection from a prince whose power had been so lately broken by her arms. The same attention to her own safety raised her resentment against the presumptive heirs of the crown. She was no stranger to the danger∣ous intrigues of the Baron de Bothmar. She knew that she had been long distrusted by the family of Hannover. The apprehensions incident to her sex had taken intire pos∣session of her mind. Though she probably entertained little affection for a brother whom she had never seen; though, with a zeal suitable to her family, she was ut∣terly averse from his system of religious faith, and wed∣ded to her own; though she was as much afraid of his presence in Britain as she was terrified at the coming of a prince of the electoral family; she seems to have en∣tered with a degree of warmth into his cause.<NOTE N="P" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1712.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Her attach∣ment to the eventual succession</NOTE> The violence of the Whigs, and the imprudence of the Baron de Bothmar, might have precipitated the mea∣sures of Anne in concluding the peace; but there is reason to believe, that her schemes in favour of the Pretender were prior to her late fears from the House of Hannover. When Mr. Menager, in the preceding September, had finished the business of his master, he is said to have en∣deavoured to serve the views of the court of St. Ger∣mains. He first opened himself to Mr. Secretary St. John. He was introduced, by his means, to Mrs. Masham, the Queen's favourite. Two articles of im∣portance were settled in this conference. The Queen
<PB N="495" REF="518"/>
desired to be permitted to disown her brother, to satisfy the confederates. But she agreed, that the treaty should not be understood to preclude France from aiding the Pretender, in case of her own decease. Mrs. Masham is said to have declared, with freedom, the secret senti∣ments of her mistress. She told Menager, that the Queen reckoned it an unhappiness to possess the throne of her brother. That she had a secret uneasiness on that head. That this was not all her misfortune. That she was obliged, against her disposition and principles, to pro∣mote measures calculated to exclude her own family, for ever, from the throne; and that she would be inexpres∣sibly happy to be delivered from the necessity of doing so much wrong<NOTE N="Q" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">of the Pre∣tender to the throne.</NOTE> Mrs. Masham, at the same time, declared, that though the Queen wished to promote her brother's interest, she could fix upon no measure of serving, effectually, his cause. That though a majority of the better sort were attached to the hereditary descent of the crown, the common people entertained a mortal aversion to a Popish successor. That it was utterly impossible to enter into any treaty, without confirming the settlement of the crown in the Protestant line. That she had no hopes but such as arose from the most Christian King. That she wished to relieve that Prince from every obligation of not assisting her brother, in case of her own demise. That she could not trust her plenipotentiaries. "But sure," said she, <Q REND="inline">"some reserves may be made for the time to come<NOTE N="R" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>."</Q> Sentiments expressed with so little reserve, to a foreigner, could not have remained a secret to the Queen's servants. Such of these as had principles of the same kind were impressed with fears like her own. An intelligence so favourable to their views was soon con∣veyed to St. Germains. The Pretender instructed his adherents, in both houses of parliament, to forward the measures of the crown. He was no stranger to the prin∣ciples of the Earl of Oxford. But he hoped, that the bad treatment he daily received from the agents of the court of Hannover, would, at length, induce him to op∣pose their views, or, at least, soften the opposition of that minister to his interest<NOTE N="S" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 1712.</NOTE>.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">His party assist the ministry.</NOTE> The Queen was extremely sensible of the service ren∣dered to her measures by the Pretender's adherents<NOTE N="T" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1712.</NOTE>. Though she had created twelve new peers, the majority for government in the house of lords was so slender, that every vote was liable to accidents. When, upon rejecting the Duke of Hamilton's patent, the peers of Scotland absented themselves, the Whigs carried a disagreeable address from the upper-house to the throne. The efforts of the treasurer, though he was supposed to have offered weighty arguments upon the subject, was not sufficient to recall the refractory Scots to their duty in parliament. Many of them were, from principle, attached to the Pretender. Resentment had roused others to a deter∣mined resolution of opposing all the measures of the Whigs. A kind of rescript from the court of St. Ger∣mains sent them back to the house of lords<NOTE N="U" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>; and the opposing party lost all the benefit which they hoped to de∣rive from their short-lived victory. The same influence was extended to the house of commons, where it was less necessary<NOTE N="V" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. The Earl of Oxford was no stranger to the support he received from the Jacobites. He re∣solved, therefore, to encourage outwardly their views. He admitted the agents of the court of St. Germains into his conversation and intimacy. His mysterious character gave an air of importance to his very nods and insinuati∣ons. He could, therefore, deceive a race of men blinded by an enthusiastic zeal for their own cause. The Lady Masham, adopting the inclinations of her mistress, was much in the interest of the Pretender. Her friendship for Oxford had long since declined. She wrote to M. Menager, on the second of March, that the affairs of the court of St. Germains had fallen into the hands of the treasurer; and that he would value himself upon deceiv∣ing their hopes, and disappointing all their views<NOTE N="W" PLACE="foot">MSS. passim.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He writes to the Queen.</NOTE> The Pretender himself, it must be confessed, never believed that the Earl of Oxford was sincere. But he knew, that to oppose that minister was to throw the whole into the hands of the Whigs. The lord-treasurer stood on a dangerous precipice. He was detested by both sides. The Whigs talked of assassination and death. The
<PB N="497" REF="520"/>
Tories threatened to deliver him over to the rage of his political enemies. In the midst of this secret ferment, the Chevalier de St. George wrote to the Queen. He told her, that, in the present situation, it was impossible for him to remain longer silent. He put her in mind of the honour and preservation of her own family. He as∣sured her of his eternal gratitude, should she use any efficacious measures toward his eventual succession to the throne. He promised, he said, the best to himself from her good-nature and humanity. He was ready to agree to whatever she might chuse to propose for her own in∣terest, which he reckoned inseparable from his own. The Queen was too prudent, or, perhaps, too timid, to make any answer to this letter. But her inclinations were suf∣ficiently known. She even expressed her terror, that France would not let him escape from her hands. The example of M. Fourbin, who refused to land him in Scotland in the year 1708, was produced as a presump∣tion that the French King was resolved never to part with a person who might hereafter favour his own de∣signs<NOTE N="X" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1712.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Artifice of the Earl of Oxford.</NOTE> Notwithstanding this anxiety in the Queen, her fears from the court of Hannover seem to have weighed more with her mind, than her affection for her brother. The intelligence, which had been industriously conveyed to her ears, concerning domestic conspiracies and foreign invasions, had even removed, for a time, her objections to the Popery of the Pretender. Urged by the Jacobites, and the most violent of the high-church party, she is said to have to resolved to lay before the parliament the secret practices of Prince Eugene, and the dangerous schemes of the Baron de Bothmar. The principles of the Earl of Oxford had been highly serviceable to the interests of the Electoral family. Though the idle pro∣ject of an invasion proceeded from the indiscreet zeal of his minister, the Elector himself had avowed openly his disapprobation of the conduct of the British court. The designs of the Whigs, if these could be proved, might, by implication, be carried home to his Highness by his enemies. Whatever the event of the inquiry might have been, the discussion of a matter so delicate would prove

extremely disagreeable to the Electoral family. A na∣tion ever subject to extraordinary panics from plots and conspiracies, might be roused to a dangerous resentment, upon very weak grounds. The Earl of Oxford foresaw these difficulties, and he dexterously prevented the scheme proposed, for laying an account of his discoveries before the parliament.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He deceives the Jaco∣bites.</NOTE> The Earl of Oxford, not content with having judici∣ously prevented an inquiry in parliament concerning the intrigues of the confederates and Whigs, had made every use of his discoveries to hasten the great work of peace. Though he disappointed Plunket, in not encouraging his intrigues in Holland, he had the address to render that Jesuit subservient to his views. He was no stranger to the circumstance, that Plunket's vigilance in detecting the schemes of his enemies proceeded from views of serving the cause of the Pretender. He therefore em∣ployed him in communicating to the court of France the discoveries which had been made, and the consequent re∣solution of Queen Anne to conclude a separate peace. To please the Jacobites, he held forth a specious tale to that impatient and credulous race of men. He insinuated, that the Pretender could not be immediately served, on account of the watchfulness of the Whigs, and the un∣surmountable prejudices of the vulgar against his family, and especially his religion; but that there was a fixed re∣solution formed of keeping a good correspondence with France, to enable that kingdom to favour his pretensions to the British throne.

The fears of Queen Anne for her own person and autho∣rity increased in proportion to his danger. The proofs which she had received of the designs of the Whigs and confederates had made a deep impression on her mind<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, passim, 1712.</NOTE>. She thought herself defenceless and alone, should the check of a pretender to the crown be removed, from the supposed views of the family of Hannover, whom she was taught to regard in the light of enemies and rivals. But though these were her inclinations, the same happy timidity which gave rise to her anxiety, prevented her from entering, with effectual eagerness, into her bro∣ther's cause. She rested all her hopes upon the court of France. She hoped, from the gratitude of Lewis the Fourteenth, for the repose which she alone could bestow, a support against the schemes of the confederates and Whigs. Urged by these and similiar motives, she could no longer hide her anxiety for peace. In the moment that fortune, by the demise of the Dauphin and his son, threatened to throw back the house of Bourbon into all the perils of a disastrous war, they were suddenly re∣lieved, by the timidity of the Queen of Great Britain. The ministry, roused by terrors for themselves, were e∣qually eager for breaking, by a separate peace, the power of the confederates.

That, on the side of Italy, the kingdoms of Naples and Sardinia, the duchy of Milan, the Spanish territories on the Tuscan shore, should be yielded to the house of Austria; that the fate of Sicily remained still undecided; but that all disputes were for ever removed, with regard to the cession of that island by the Duke of Anjou. That the difference between the barrier de∣manded by the Duke of Savoy, in the year 1709, and that offered at present by France, was very inconsidera∣ble; besides, that she herself was endeavouring to pro∣cure for his Royal Highness still greater advantages. That, in return for all, Spain and the West-Indies were to remain to King Philip; but that, to prevent the union of the crowns of France and Spain upon one head, that Prince was to renounce for ever, in the most solemn manner, all pretensions to the French monarchy<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">Journals, June 6, 1712.</NOTE>.</P>

throne of Spain; but that, by the present treaty, that power was left in the same state as when hostilities com∣menced. That the renunciation of Philip, offered as a security, was rather a matter of ridicule, than any seri∣ous proposal. That the promises and oaths of Princes were but weak obstacles in the way of their ambition. That France herself had been so just as to own, that any agreement of a Prince to break the succession of a crown was nugatory, as being contrary to the fundamental laws of the kingdom. That, should King Philip think him∣self bound by his own renunciation, neither his posterity nor the French themselves would allow that he had a power to extend the obligation beyond his own life. That, however insignificant the rights of monarchy might ap∣pear to the people of Great Britain, who had broken the line of succession in their own country, the thing was regarded with another eye in France, where the descent of the crown was deemed the first link of that great chain which kept together the vast body of the mo∣narchy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and for the peace.</NOTE> On the other side, it was affirmed, that, since the commencement of the war, the face of things was to∣tally changed; that France, broken by a series of uncom∣mon misfortunes, had ceased to be dangerous; that, as the state of affairs now stood, fresh expedients and mea∣sures were not only proper, but even necessary. That when the war began, King Charles the Third was only a titular monarch, without a revenue, without power, and without importance. That the case was now much alter∣ed, as that Prince had obtained the hereditary dominions of the house of Austria, together with the imperial crown. That it would be the height of folly to revive, in the person of the present Emperor, the power which endangered Europe in the days of Charles the Fifth. That, should the confederates resolve at any rate to place the crown of Spain on the head of the Emperor, the success would at best be doubtful. That it would be ex∣tremely idle, and highly impolitic, to throw away blood and treasure on an undertaking, which, by being accom∣plished, would destroy that very balance for which the maritime powers had so long contended with the house of Bourbon. That, as to Philip's renunciation, though a slender thing in itself, it derived great force from the ef∣forts
<PB N="502" REF="525"/>
of those who were to enjoy its benefits; that, as matters were situated, the best means had been used for answering the end for which the war began; that there was at present but a bare possibility that the succession of France should fall to the share of the King of Spain; but that there was a certainty of present danger, from the union of the Spanish monarchy to the power of the house of Austria, strengthened by the influence derived by that family from an uninterrupted possession of the Imperial crown.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The com∣mons vote an address of thanks.</NOTE> In the house of commons, an address of thanks was voted, without one dissenting voice<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">Journals, June 6, 1712.</NOTE>. But the lords adjourned the business to the next day; and, when they met, fell into warm debates. Though the Whigs af∣fected to despise the articles of the proposed peace, these were well received by the body of a nation already groan∣ing under the burden of an unprofitable war. The terms were deemed by the dispassionate favourable to the king∣dom. In the treaty of the year 1709, upon which the excluded party highly valued themselves, no specific ad∣vantages to Great Britain were proposed. In the pre∣sent, she had not only obtained a security to her com∣merce, but even an accession of territory. The truth is, that the whole was very inadequate to the expence of the war, and unsuitable to its uncommon success. No doubt can now be entertained, that, had the confederates continued to press France on the side of Flanders, but the crown of Spain must have been relinquished by the house of Bourbon. But it is extremely doubtful, whe∣ther the British ministry were acquainted with a circum∣stance, which the French only owned when the season for redressing the evil was past. The opposition in the house of lords, despairing to prevent the address, endea∣voured to clog it with an amendment. They proposed an addition to the motion for obtaining the guarantee of the allies to the treaty: but, upon a division, it was re∣jected by a great majority<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">June 7.</NOTE>.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Other tran∣sactions.</NOTE> Their approbation of the articles of peace was the last business of importance transacted in this session of parlia∣ment. Besides the great business of the treaty, and the consequent contests of parties on that subject, some other affairs, that deserve to be mentioned, fell under discussion in the two houses. The act for a general naturalization of all foreign Protestants was repealed<NOTE N="F" PLACE="foot">Feb. 9.</NOTE>. This law, which had been passed by the Whigs when in power, had been always odious to the high-church party. They said, that as most Protestants abroad differed from the church-government established in England, so the natura∣lizing bill was calculated to increase the number of Dis∣senters in the kingdom. But, after the surmises of a pro∣jected invasion were carried to the ministry, one other essential reason was added to the former, for repealing the act. The party affirmed, that when that law subsist∣ed, no importation of foreign Protestants could be deem∣ed illegal; that a foreign Prince might become, when he pleased, master of the kingdom, by sending judiciously his subjects before him into a country where they became denizens, at the expence of a shilling a head, the com∣mon price of an oath to the government. That, should such a Prince, which was likely to be soon the case, as∣cend the throne of Great Britain, he might, without any breach on the laws of the kingdom, enslave the na∣tion with an army of his native subjects.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">of parlia∣ment.</NOTE> The repealing of the act of naturalization was consi∣dered by the Dissenters in the light of an attack upon themselves. But this was not the only invasion on their established opinions, of which they chose to complain. The commons, in their attachment to the church of Eng∣land, extended their protection to the episcopal clergy in Scotland. A bill was introduced, for granting a tolera∣tion to all such as should use the liturgy of the church, in that part of the kingdom. The thing seemed so reasona∣ble, that no opposition was made. But a clause in the bill required the civil magistrates to execute none of the sentences of the judicatory of the church of Scotland. The Presbyterians were alarmed at a circumstance, that annihilated their ecclesiastical authority. The bill, how∣ever, passed with little opposition in either house. It was
<PB N="504" REF="527"/>
followed by another, which was contrary to the Presby∣terian principles. The courts of judicature in Scotland were commanded, by an act, to discontinue their sittings, during some days at Christmas, though the observing of holidays is contrary to the tenets of Presbytery. But the most mortifying act of all, was that for restoring patron∣ages, which had been abolished in King William's reign. In vain was it urged, that such an invasion on the church of Scotland was a breach upon the union of the two king∣doms, by which the rights of Presbytery were unaltera∣bly secured. The bill passed with little opposition, not∣withstanding the complaints and petitions of several of the Scotish clergy<NOTE N="G" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. iv.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Campaign of 1712. Inactivity of Ormond.</NOTE> While the nation were in a state of suspence, with re∣gard to the negociations carried on between Great Bri∣tain and France, the confederates took the field in Flan∣ders. The Prince of Savoy had received a reinforcement of Germans, that increased the army to the number of one hundred and twenty-two thousand men. The Duke of Ormond, who had succeeded Marlborough in the com∣mand of the British forces, and such troops as were in British pay, arrived in the camp near Douay, in the end of April. That nobleman found himself extremely un∣easy in the high station in which he was placed. He had carried orders from the Queen to hazard, by no means, a battle, unless he perceived an apparent and great advan∣tage. He was sensible of the extreme difficulty of exe∣cuting such undecisive orders, and, at the same time, of concealing the real motive of his conduct from the pene∣trating eye of the Prince of Savoy. He, however, re∣solved to obey her Majesty's commands, and to prevent, as much as possible, the cause of his conduct from being even suspected<NOTE N="H" PLACE="foot">M. de Torey, tom. ii.</NOTE>. The strong situation of the French army, under the Mareschal de Villars, who had posted himself behind the Scheld, had induced the Duke to hope that no action could happen. The Prince of Savoy, however, finding that the enemy had not occupied with entrenchments the small space between the source of the Somme and that of the Scheld, made dispositions for at∣tacking Villars. His design was to decide the fate of the war by a battle, or to force the French to retire, and to
<PB N="505" REF="528"/>
leave Cambray exposed to a siege. He communicated his intentions to the Duke of Ormond, on the twenty-eighth of May. His Grace declining to give an imme∣diate answer, confirmed the Prince in the suspicions which he had for some time entertained. The deputies of the States sent an immediate account of Ormond's inactivity to the Hague. The States sent an express to the court of Great Britain. The Whigs brought the affair into the house of lords. But the ministry were neither moved with the representations of the Dutch, nor the majority of the peers persuaded by the clamours of the excluded party<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot">Journals.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Consterna∣tion of the confede∣rates.</NOTE> During this state of altercation and suspence, the Prince of Savoy resolved to sit down before Quesnoy. This siege was but of short continuance. The town surrendered after a weak defence, and the garrison were made priso∣ners of war. The spirits of the confederates, depressed by the inactivity of Ormond, were greatly exalted by this success. But as the proposed cessation of arms be∣tween Great Britain and France was no longer a matter of mere suspicion, the former dejection of the allies re∣turned. They pretended to make no doubt, but that all the troops in British pay would follow the British forces. They dreaded, that the Mareschal de Villars would take advantage of the separation, and attack the Prince of Savoy. The States, in particular, were afraid of a ter∣rible reverse of fortune, at the end of a prosperous war. Their plenipotentiaries at Utrecht reproached the Bishop of Bristol with the odious conduct of his court. They perceived themselves exposed, in a desenceless state, to the vengeance of an enemy whom they had treated with haughtiness and contempt. They exaggerated the perils of their condition. They even mixed threats with ex∣pressions of despair. But their former courage returned, then they understood that the foreign troops in the pay of Great Britain refused to follow the Duke of Ormond.</P>

this contrivance, the French King from delivering up Dunkirk to the British forces. That circumstance, which was likely to happen, would infallibly raise the clamours of the populace against the ministry, terrify the Tories in parliament, and give a plausible pretext to the Whigs to send the authors of the ineffectual peace to the Tower. The Duke, in conjunction with the Lords Halifax and Somers, proposed another scheme, more decisive in its consequences, but less easy to be accomplished. They advised the States to assist the Elector of Hannover to pass with a force into Great Britain. Their project was to spread a report, that the Pretender, at the instigation of the ministry, was preparing to invade the kingdom with a French army; and, at the same time, to declare in a manifesto, that his Electoral Highness was arrived, to secure the succession of the crown in the Protestant line<NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1713.</NOTE>. They affirmed, that the people, alarmed for their religion and liberty, would flock round his standard; and that the Queen, like her father, would make her escape to France. This plausible project is said to have been transmitted to the Princess Sophia. But the less violent Whigs are reported to have advised her clandestinely to refuse her consent; as that measure might furnish the Tories, already averse from the interests of her family, with a pretence for altering the succession<NOTE N="L" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The auxili∣aries refuse to obey the Duke of Or∣mond.</NOTE> The refusal of the foreign troops to obey the Duke of Ormond transferred the perplexity of the other confede∣rates to the British court. They had agreed with the French, that the Queen's troops, consisting of twenty-five battalions and ninety-four squadrons, should separate themselves from the army under the Prince of Savoy. But when Ormond communicated his orders for that pur∣pose to the generals of the auxiliaries, they refused to obey. One battalion and four squadrons of the Duke of Holstein, and two squadrons of Walef's regiment of dra∣goons of the country of Liege, were the only foreigner that seemed ready to follow the British general<NOTE N="M" PLACE="foot">Mem. de Torcy, tom. ii.</NOTE>.

The
<PB N="507" REF="530"/>
indignation of the Tories was equally excessive. Reports were spread, that a design was formed by the Prince of Savoy to disarm the British forces, and to confine the Duke of Ormond. This question had certainly been agi∣tated at the consults of the malecontents with Prince Eugene, in the month of February<NOTE N="N" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers. De Torcy.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The French refuse to de∣liver up Dunkirk.</NOTE> The refusal of the auxiliaries to obey his orders, re∣duced the Duke of Ormond to a state of the utmost per∣plexity and uneasiness. He delayed his march, till he should receive positive commands from his court. The ministry were thrown into a degree of consternation, by fresh complaints on the subject from the French King. They had lost the confidence of the allies. They had fallen under the distrust of the court of Versailles. The principal terms of the stipulated cessation was the delivery of Dunkirk, and the immediate confirmation of the re∣nunciation made by King Philip, of his eventual succes∣sion to the crown of France. Lewis the Fourteenth in∣formed the Queen of Great Britain, that he understood the proposed cessation to be general between the two ar∣mies. That, should he even satisfy himself with a par∣ticular cessation, he wished to be understood, that all the troops in British pay should quit the rest of the confede∣rates. That, till this condition should be fulfilled, he thought proper to suspend his orders for admitting the British troops into Dunkirk. Mr. Secretary St. John soon removed this difficulty, by the express orders of his mistress. He wrote to the Marquis de Torcy, that the Queen was resolved to unite herself effectually with France, to defeat this last effort of men, who, to satisfy their private resentment, wished to protract the calami∣ties of war. That, to shew the firmness of her mind and sincerity of her intentions, she had commanded him to signify to the ministers from those Princes whose troops were in the British pay, that, should they persist to sepa∣rate themselves from her native troops, they should ex∣pect no more of her money<NOTE N="O" PLACE="foot">M. de Torcy, tom. ii.</NOTE>.

They fore∣saw, that the confederates, upon being deserted by Great Britain, would either seriously think of peace, or become subject to a sudden reverse in war. Orders were imme∣diately dispatched for delivering Dunkirk to the British troops. The obstructions experienced already by the Duke of Ormond induced the ministry to place the fate of the peace in a kind of independence upon accident. They sent Sir John Leake to take the command of the fleet in the Downs. They ordered him to provide trans∣ports for carrying troops to occupy Dunkirk from Great Britain. On the eighth of July, Brigadier Hill took possession of the place. Two days before this event, the Prince of Savoy separated himself from the British troops, and sat down before Landrecy. The Duke of Ormond, directing his route to Avesne le Seiq, declared, at that place, a suspension of arms. In his march toward Ghent, which city, together with Bruges, he intended to occupy, he was refused by the confederates a passage through Bouchain. He was treated with the same disrespect and distrust by the garrisons of Douay, Tournay, Oudenarde, and Lisle. On the twelfth of July, the Duke took pos∣session of Ghent, and, soon after, of Bruges; and thus, by commanding the navigation of the Lys and Scheld, became the umpire of the operations between the contend∣ing armies<NOTE N="P" PLACE="foot">Publications of the Times.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The allies defeated at Denain.</NOTE> The good-fortune of the confederates ceased at the se∣paration of the British forces from their army in Flanders. The happy rashness of the Duke of Marlborough, in the preceding campaign, had rendered the Prince of Savoy the only rival of his glory, more enterprising. Having opened the trenches before Landrecy, he placed a body of his troops at Denain, to favour the passage of his con∣voys from Marchiennes<NOTE N="Q" PLACE="foot">Hist. d'Angleterre.</NOTE>. His own camp was forti∣fied, and independent of insult. But the Mareschal de Villars, however, had the address to render the Prince
<PB N="509" REF="532"/>
afraid of being attacked; which induced him to weaken the body of troops commanded by the Earl of Albemarle at Denain. That lord's force, at last, consisted of four∣teen thousand men. Villars, having made a feint of ad∣vancing towards his right, on the side of Landrecy, turn∣ed suddenly to the left, and arriving at Neuville in the morning of the twenty-fourth, threw at once three bridges across the Scarpe. The Prince of Savoy, apprized of the unexpected march of the enemy, hastened to the lines between Denain and Neuville. He reinforced the Earl of Albemarle with six battalions. He went in person to hasten the march of his right wing. He had scarce quitted the lines, when they were entered, almost with∣out resistance, by the Count de Broglio. Four battalions of Palatines and other German auxiliaries threw down their arms and fled. The whole French line, having passed the Scheld, were led by Villars against the camp of the Earl of Albemarle. He marched up to the enemy, without firing a single shot. He entered the intrench∣ments, cut those who resisted to pieces, and forced the survivors to fly. But their retreat was cut off by the precaution of the French general, who had occupied a bridge, which they had built behind, on the Scheld.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rapid pro∣gress of France.</NOTE> The loss of the confederates was considerable, in an ac∣tion which decided the fate of the war.

He attempted, in vain, to force the bridge occupied by the French. This, however, was only the beginning of a long chain of mis∣fortunes. Marchiennes, where all the magazines of the confederates were deposited, was taken, in three days.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Campaign in Spain, Italy, Dau∣phiné, and on the Rhine.</NOTE> The signal events of this campaign were confined to Flanders. No enterprise of consequence was undertaken, no action of renown happened on any other side of the war. In Italy, the Imperialists besieged and took Porto Hercole. In Spain, the Count de Staremberg, though delivered from a formidable enemy by the death of Ven∣dôme, attempted nothing important. King Philip, hav∣ing a near prospect of peace, permitted the war to lan∣guish on his side. In Dauphiné and Savoy, the summer was spent by the contending armies in observing each other's motions. An inactivity prevailed on the frontiers of Portugal. The Duke of Wirtemberg, who com∣manded the army of the Empire on the Rhine, formed a project, toward the end of the campaign, to force the lines of Weissembourg, and to penetrate into Alsace. Having detached two bodies of his troops, by two diffe∣rent roads, they were deceived by their guides, and, meeting in the night, charged one another as enemies, and returned, in the utmost confusion, to their own camp.

Mr. Secretary St. John
<PB N="511" REF="534"/>
who had been raised to the peerage, on the seventh of July, by the title of Viscount Bolingbroke, had demand∣ed that article, in terms more likely to create a quarrel, than to facilitate the conclusion of the negociation. But when the court of France was embarrassed about the an∣swer most proper to be made to his Lordship, he inform∣ed them, by letter, that he was commanded by the Queen to go in person to France. He accordingly ar∣rived at Paris, in the end of the month of August. His instructions furnished his Lordship with full powers to bring the negociation to a speedy conclusion. But this power was annexed to the indispensable condition of obtaining Sicily for the Duke of Savoy. The Queen of Great Britain expressed a particular atten∣tion to that Prince, which might be considered unac∣countable upon any other grounds, than her deeming his family, after herself and the Pretender, the next in blood to the succession of the crown, upon the ancient form. But though she insisted upon obtaining an immediate kingdom for the Duke, her principal object in his favour was the eventual succession of the house of Savoy to the throne of Spain, after the failure of King Philip and his posterity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bolingbroke sent to France.</NOTE> This sudden resolution of sending Bolingbroke to France proceeded from the earnestness for peace express∣ed upon every occasion by that lord. He had advised the Queen to prefer a suspension of hostilities, as the most certain means of obviating the difficulties which the enemies of peace opposed to a simple cessation of arms. The example of Great Britain, he affirmed, would be soon followed by the confederates. The Kings of Por∣tugal and Prussia, he said, as well as the Duke of Savoy, and the Dutch, were too prudent to continue the war after the separation of such a powerful ally as Great Bri∣tain; and, should the Emperor and empire sacrifice their convenience and interest to their resentment, he assured her, that they would soon drop a contest which they could not maintain with any effect. The Earl of Oxford opposed the advice of Bolingbroke, to avoid giving of∣fence to the Elector of Hannover. Though he was attach∣ed from principle to that Prince, he was apprehensive of being called to an account whenever he should ascend the
<PB N="512" REF="535"/>
British throne. This event seemed to be at no great dis∣tance, as the Queen daily declined in her health. This was the cause of all those delays and uneasinesses which might have been prevented by a definitive treaty between Great Britain and France. This conduct was extremely impolitic in the minister, as it gave an appearance of ti∣midity to his measures; a circumstance which exposed him to all the machinations and intrigues of his own ene∣mies and those of the peace<NOTE N="Y" PLACE="foot">M. de Torcy, tom. ii. Stuart-papers, 1712.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Terms set∣tled be∣tween him and de Tor∣cy.</NOTE> When Bolingbroke arrived at Paris, he entered into conferences with the Marquis de Torcy on the object of his embassy. The two ministers, possessed of unlimited powers from their respective courts, soon agreed: That the Duke of Savoy and his descendants should be called to the throne of Spain, in default of King Philip and his male posterity. That this substitution should be inserted in all the public acts, with regard to the renunciation of Philip's right to the crown of France. That the renun∣ciation itself should be registered in the books of the par∣liament of Paris, and admitted solemnly by the cortes or states of Castile and Arragon. That the cession of Sicily to the Duke of Savoy should for the present remain a se∣cret for various reasons. But that he should never be suffered to alienate that island for any other territory. The article of the barrier to this favoured Prince was not so easily settled. The French minister refused to grant more for that purpose than Exilles, Fenestrelles, and the valley of Pragelas. This whole affair was therefore re∣ferred to the general congress at Utrecht. The two se∣cretaries of Great Britain and France having settled these terms, the Viscount Bolingbroke had an audience of the French King. He was received with the utmost polite∣ness by that Prince; and was treated by the whole court with a respect suitable to the earnest desire of the king∣dom for peace.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">States eager for peace.</NOTE> The change of affairs in Flanders had rendered the confederates sensible that they were incapable to maintain the war should Great Britain desert the grand alliance. The Dutch, who had most to lose by a continuation of hostilities, were the first who seriously thought of peace. The defeat at Denain, the subsequent misfortunes, the disappointment of the projects of the Prince of Savoy, had blasted their hopes and humbled their pride. Their eyes were opened to the true state of their affairs. They descended at once from that haughtiness with which they had been inspired by the success of the war. Instead of prescribing terms to the house of Bourbon, they solicited the good offices of Great Britain, for renewing the con∣ferences, which had been long interrupted by their own obstinacy. They dropt their pretensions of receiving all the answers of the French plenipotentiaries in writing. The latter, therefore, agreed to renew the conferences, upon condition that the Queen of Great Britain's speech to her parliament should be admitted as the plan of the treaty. The ministers of the other allies were alarmed at the pusillanimity of the Dutch. Count Zinzendorff, the Imperial minister, repeated his exhortations and pro∣mises. He assured them, that the Prince of Savoy was on his march to fight Villars. That he was sure of vic∣tory. That, as there was no risk in suspending the con∣ferences, the States ought to temporize, by waiting for the result of events<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Swift's Four Years. De Torcy, tom. ii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An incident interrupts the con∣ferences.</NOTE> Zinzendorff prevailed. The conferences, under vari∣ous pretences, were delayed. But when time brought no favourable change, the Dutch fell into their former fears. They redoubled their solicitations for the renewal of the conferences of Utrecht. A silly quarrel between the ser∣vants of M. Menager, one of the French plenipotenti∣aries, and those of the Count de Rechteren, deputy of the province of Overyssel, interrupted again the great work of peace. The French King took advantage of the folly of Rechteren, as it was not his interest to con∣set with the allies till he had settled his measures with the Viscount Bolingbroke. The pretence itself was plau∣sible. He insisted that the States should declare whether Rechteren followed their orders in his insolent conduct,
<PB N="514" REF="537"/>
or whether he had pursued the dictates of a passionate mind, inflamed by the arts of the house of Austria. If he acted in obedience to his masters, there was no safety, he said, for his ministers at Utrecht. If he had no guide but his own passion, the States were called upon to disa∣vow the conduct of a servant who had abused their con∣fidence. The French King therefore told them, that Rechteren should be recalled by his constituents, and ano∣ther deputy be appointed in his place. This dictatorial conduct, so contrary to the abject behaviour of the court of France in the year 1709, was not capable to raise the indignation of the States. The haughtiness, which as∣sumed the name of spirit at that period, had vanished with their good fortune; and they suffered an enemy whom they despised to retort upon them their own wan∣ton insolence with impunity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen interferes for the Dutch.</NOTE> The abject behaviour of the States was, at present, of some advantage to their affairs. Their submission to the French reconciled the court of Great Britain to their in∣terest. The resentment of the British nation ceased, with the obstinacy of the Dutch. The ministry resolved to interfere in their cause. They pressed, therefore, the court of France to a separate peace. They desired them to register immediately the renunciations, as on them the peace of Europe depended. That, upon the fulfilling of this essential article, the Queen of Great Britain should declare, that she could obtain no other plan but that of∣fered by France. That it was the business of the con∣federates to determine upon this head. That they should have three months to consider; but that the French King should be no longer obliged to grant even these terms, after the expiration of the time. The Queen insisted, in return, with the court of Versailles, to depart from their claims, on the restitution of Tournay<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">M. de Torcy, tom. ii.</NOTE>. That town, she said, as it was the great object of the States, was also necessary to their barrier. Though Lewis had re∣solved to retain Tournay, he yielded prudently to her request. He sound, that by the bad state of the Queen's health, there was reason to fear she might die in the midst of an unfinished war. He knew that the ministry must fall with her life. That their enemies and his own would again possess themselves of the whole power of the

kingdom. That a Prince, who had declared himself averse from peace, was to mount the throne, and was likely to renew or rather to continue the war<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">M. de Torcy, tom. ii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Secret views of the Queen</NOTE> This prudential concession of Lewis the Fourteenth, smoothed the way for a treaty which was not destined to be soon concluded. But though the clandestine measures, for restoring peace, employed much of the time of Queen Anne, a part of her attention was turned to views that were still more secret. Those who were most about her person, perceiving her inclinations, urged her perpe∣tually with regard to the interest of the Pretender. She seemed willing to favour his views. But she perceived obstacles in his way, which he himself had not the strength of mind to remove. In her own attachment to the church of England, she signified her inclinations that the Pretender should relinquish Popery, and place himself in a capacity of being served. When she was urged, by the Duke of Buckingham, to endeavour to break the succession in the Protestant line, her answer, though it conveyed a regard for her brother, was suitable to good sense and prudence. <Q REND="inline">"How can I serve him,"</Q> she said, <Q REND="inline">"my Lord? He makes not the least step to oblige me, in what I most desire. You know a Papist cannot enjoy this crown in peace. But the example of the father has no weight with the son. He prefers his religious errors to the throne of a great kingdom. How, therefore, can I undo what I have already done? He may thank him∣self for his exclusion. He knows that I love my own family better than that of any other. All would be easy, should he enter the pale of the church of England. Ad∣vise him to change his religion, as that only can change the opinions of mankind, in his favour<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, July 1712.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">with regard to the Pre∣tender.</NOTE> Though Buckingham had assured the family of Han∣nover, that he had been persecuted by the Whigs, for this attachment to the Protestant succession<NOTE N="E" PLACE="foot">Hannover-papers, passim.</NOTE>, he con∣veyed this intelligence to the court of St. Germains. He, at the same time, seconded the request of the Queen. But his arguments were lost on the Pretender and his ser∣vants. Though that unfortunate Prince was in no dan∣ger of becoming an apostle, like his father, he was, per∣haps, 
<PB N="516" REF="539"/>
equally attached to the Romish faith. Under a pre∣tence that his conversion would be deemed insincere, he evaded the request of his friends. He affirmed, he had so little prejudice against the religion of his country, that he intended to carry along with him, to the place of his exile, a Protestant clergyman, to officiate to his Protestant servants. That when he should be permitted to return to Great Britain, he would be ready to hear such arguments as might induce him to change his present faith. That it was even the interest of England to have a Prince on the throne, whose religion would lessen the power which the constitution had placed in his hands. That, as he was ready to relinquish, during his own time, the prero∣gative of nominating Bishops, and of appointing clergy∣men to livings, no danger could be apprehended by the established church. That he was willing the present tests, so far as they regarded Popery, should continue; and, as he entertained no prejudice against the doctrines of the church of England, he was ready to have no ser∣vants but such as were of the Protestant persuasion<NOTE N="F" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1712.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections.</NOTE> These professions might be honest; but they were an irrefragable proof of weakness. A man who relinquished his hopes of a great kingdom; for a speculative tenet of faith, discovered a degree of enthusiasm that ought never to be trusted. Insincerity itself is less a crime in a prince than folly. He who wishes to govern nations, must rule them through their principles; otherwise his government becomes a tyranny, and only lasts as long as it is not op∣posed. Among a people accustomed to monarchy, the Sovereign only is capable of shaking his own throne. To differ from his subjects, in their religious opinions, is al∣most the only prerogative which he may not, without danger, employ. Of all mankind, HE has the least right to be singular in his faith. If he is not willing to go to heaven in the same way with his people, they will scaree acknowledge the legality of his authority on earth. That public affection, which is the chief support of his throne must be changed for suspicion and jealousy. A mutual distrust prevails, which will soon degenerate into that un∣forgiving aversion, that invariably follows a difference of faith, in feeble minds. When society is even mellowed down into an indifference, which borders on infidelity
<PB N="517" REF="540"/>
the worst consequences are to be expected and feared. Indignation against the weakness of a bigot will, even then, supply the place of religious zeal; and violence itself becomes just, in a certain degree, when it is op∣posed to folly.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Tories urge the Pretender</NOTE> The generality of the Tories, in their vehement zeal for the hereditary descent of the crown, overlooked the attachment of the Pretender to the Popish faith. Afraid only of the violence of the common people, they re∣commended to him to make a show of changing his reli∣gion. They assured him, that should he declare himself a member of the church of England, without the for∣mality of a public conversion, they would endeavour to obtain the repeal of the act of settlement, in the present parliament. That, however, the Pretender could not be mentioned in the new law. That the disposal of the crown, according to the precedents of former times, should be vested in the reigning Queen. That, however, she must be restricted to leave her throne to a Protestant. That, as her affection for her brother was not be suspect∣ed, they had no apprehensions of her not making a will in his favour. That, in the mean time, to obviate every danger of disappointment, he should be permitted to live in Scotland. That they expected, from his own pru∣dence, a moderate comportment during his sister's life. That, considering the bad state of her health, the pos∣session of the crown could be no distant object; and that an outward compliance with the forms of worship esta∣blished by law, in Great Britain, was only wanting to the completion of the whole design<NOTE N="G" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1712.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">to change his religion.</NOTE> Though the hopes of the Tories were too sanguine to be so very easily accomplished, there was a degree of good fortune in the religious obstinacy of the Pretender. Had he been less prejudiced, or perhaps more dishonest, he might, at this period, break, or, at least, greatly en∣danger the succession of the family of Hannover to the crown. Though men of distinction and eminence have ascribed the success of the Revolution and Protestant suc∣cession to their own abilities and patriotism, the benefits of both were derived from the happy zeal of the common people for the established religion. Though the ex∣cluded

A popular cry against their bigotry, which was far from being ill-founded, was more fatal to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, than the act of settlement. The most zealous of their abettors were unable to stop this torrent. When they planned their measures, in se∣cret, for the restoration of their favourite line of Kings, they were terrified from all their schemes, by the cla∣mours of the populace. Those, therefore, who wished, at this period, that the Pretender should change his reli∣gion, were his best friends. Without reconciling the lower sort, in some degree, to his person, by his adopt∣ing their saith, it is extremely doubtful, whether the ab∣rogation of the act of settlement, the zeal of his sister, or the efforts of all his friends, could render him secure upon the throne<NOTE N="H" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1712.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Designs of the Whigs.</NOTE> But though the Whigs suspected these secret intrigues, and conveyed insinuations concerning them to the public, with many aggravating circumstances, they were not able to gain the people to their views. They affirmed, that by a secret article of the separate peace between Great Britain and France, Scotland was to be immediately ceded to the Pretender<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot">Ibid. July 1712.</NOTE>. They carried their surmizes, with unabated diligence, to the press. But there they met the enemy upon disadvantageous ground. The Earl of Ox∣ford had the good fortune to be supported, before the public, by able and persevering writers. He owed this circumstance, like his power, to the state of the times, and neither to his own liberality nor conduct. The dan∣gers of domestic compiracies, from the Whigs, and even of an invasion from abroad, by the confederates, were inculcated with vivacity and force. Though no effec∣tual measures for carrying into execution either of these designs, had been taken by the discontented, they failed more from the want of opportunity than inclination. The excluded party, and especially the Duke of Marl∣borough, who still preserved an influence with the, Dutcl., continued to urge the confederates to continue the war<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> They were even said to have eagerly sug∣gested an attempt, similar to that which had proved so successful at the late Revolution.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Oxford pays court, in vain, to the house of Hannover.</NOTE> During schemes, formed by the two parties, the Earl of Oxford pursued a secret line of his own. Perceiving the declining health of the Queen, he was anxious to stretch beyond her life the term of his power; or, at least, to insure his safety. To this point was directed all his care and attention, in times sufficiently agitated with more important concerns. To accomplish his purpose, he endeavoured, by deceiving the court of St. Germains, with his mysterious conduct, to gain the favour of the house of Hannover<NOTE N="L" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. In both he was equally unsuccess∣ful. The Jacobites formed some hopes, on the necessity of his situation, but none upon his attachment to their cause. The Electoral family, swayed by the misrepresentations of the Whigs, became insensible to all his submissions and earnest professions<NOTE N="M" PLACE="foot">Han∣nover-papers.</NOTE>. To solicit their good opi∣nion, he had ordered Mr. Thomas Harley from Utrecht to the court of Hannover. To bespeak a favourable re∣ception, Harley carried to the Princess Sophia the act, passed in the last session of parliament, for settling the precedence of her family, as the next heirs of the crown of Great Britain. Harley, who from the station of an assistant to the secretary of the treasury, was thus raised to the character of ambassador extraordinary, arrived at Hannover, in the month of July. If he was charged with any thing but professions of attachment from the minister, he had not the good fortune to succeed. The Elector continued, with all his influence, to oppose the peace; and made, at the same time, no secret of his dis∣trust of the Queen, and her principal servants.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Duke of Hamilton appointed ambassador to France.</NOTE> With regard to the latter, the Elector was certainly deceived. But a doubt can scarce be formed, that Anne herself was extremely averse from the succession of his Highness to the throne. She was no stranger to the at∣tachment of the lord-treasurer to the house of Hannover. She knew that Bolingbroke had never brought any prin∣ciple in competition with his own interest. She was re∣solved to trust neither, in an affair which seems to have
<PB N="520" REF="543"/>
engaged the greatest part of her thoughts. With a na∣tural jealousy of her own authority, she declined to gra∣tify the Jacobites by calling her brother into the kingdom. But she was extremely anxious to settle with France, some plan to secure his eventual succession, after her own death. To accomplish her purpose, she had, very early in the present year, fixed her eyes on the Duke of Ha∣milton, as a proper person to be sent ambassador to the court of Versailles. Bolingbroke, who managed the trea∣ty, hitherto, frustrated this design, by taking that pro∣vince to himself, in the preceding summer. But, soon after the return of that nobleman from Paris, she appoint∣ed the Duke her ambassador-extraordinary to the French King.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He is un∣fairly killed in a duel.</NOTE> An accident, fatal to the Duke of Hamilton, disap∣pointed at once the designs of the Queen and the hopes of the Jacobites from his embassy. The Duke and the Lord Mohun, a man of an infamous character<NOTE N="N" PLACE="foot">Swift's four last years.</NOTE>, who had been twice tried for murder, had been engaged in a te∣dious law-suit, for many years, the circumstances of which had kindled between them the most bitter ani∣mosity and enmity. Being both present at the examina∣tion of witnesses, at the chambers of a master in chancery, Hamilton threw a kind of reflection on one of the persons examined, which seemed to glance at the Lord Mohun. His Lordship, urged by one General Macartney, a per∣son attached to the Whigs, and especially to the Duke of Marlborough, sent a challenge to the Duke; and they met, in Hyde-park, in the morning of the fifteenth of November. Hamilton killed his adversary, on the spot, though he himself was wounded. When, faint with the loss of blood, he was leaning in the arms of his second, he is said to have been barbarously stabbed in the breast by Macartney<NOTE N="O" PLACE="foot">Ibid. Examination be¦fore the council.</NOTE>. He died, in a few minutes, in the field. Macartney made his escape. A proclamation was issued against him by the privy-council.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Duke of Marlbo∣rough quits the king∣dom.</NOTE> The current running violently against the Whigs, upon this occasion, the Duke of Marlborough, who was, per∣haps unjustly, accused of being privy to the challenge, thought proper to retire from the kingdom. The Earl of Oxford is said to have embraced this favourable oppor∣tunity, for ridding himself of an enemy whom he had reason to fear. He informed his Grace, that he was well acquainted with his correspondence abroad, and his intrigues at home. That he knew of his secret applica∣tions to the States, his clandestine measures to induce the troops to desert the Duke of Ormond, his secret designs against the government, his dangerous consults with the Prince of Savoy. That he had long been no stranger to his correspondence with the court of St. Germains. That he had been apprized of his negociations for selling a peace to France, on a former occasion; and his present project for invading the kingdom with a foreign sorce. That, notwithstanding the proofs in his hands, he meant nothing less than to seek his life or to ruin his fortune. That, however, for his own security, he must request his Grace to quit the kingdom, as the only means to put an end to his own suspicions and the fears of the Queen<NOTE N="Q" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1712, 1714.</NOTE>. They had a meeting on this subject at the house of Mr. Thomas Harley; and Marlborough left London, on the twenty-fourth of November.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Duke of Shrewsberry sent to France.</NOTE> The death of the Duke of Hamilton made way for the Duke of Shrewsberry as ambassador to the court of Ver∣sailles. The jealousy of the lord-treasurer is said to have raised his Grace to that dignity. Both Shrewsberry and Buckingham were much attached to the cause of the Pre∣tender. They had great influence with the Queen, and they led the cabinet-council. To remove them from of∣fice was beyond the lord-treasurer's power. Yet they were great checks upon the execution of his own designs. He apprehended from Shrewsberry, though a Jacobite, no danger in France; as the timidity of his character was a sufficient security against his principles. Though the
<PB N="522" REF="545"/>
peace with the house of Bourbon was not formally con∣cluded, acts of confidence and friendship had passed, for some months before, between them and the court of London. The Lord Lexington, having been appointed ambassador-extraordinary to Philip the Fifth, had arriv∣ed at Madrid, in the middle of October. The professed business of Lexington was to be present at the King of Spain's solemn renunciation of the crown of France, for himself and his posterity; which ceremony was perform∣ed in the presence of the council of Castile and Arragon. Philip, in return to the embassy of Great Britain, order∣ed the Marquis de Monteleone to repair to London in a public capacity. No Prince could owe more to another, than the King of Spain to Queen Anne; and, therefore, the politeness of the ambassador was expressive of his mas∣ter's gratitude<NOTE N="R" PLACE="foot">Publications of the Times.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs</NOTE> Whilst the war in the West of Europe was hastening to a period, that in the North and East was carried on with various turns of fortune. The obstinacy of the King of Sweden detained him still at Bender. His kingdom was pressed on every side by powerful enemies. His in∣trigues at Constantinople effectuated various changes in the Ottoman ministry. In the year 1711, the Turks, by his influence, declared war against the Russians. An army of one hundred and fifty thousand men passed, in seven columns, the Danube. They advanced to the southern bank of the Pruth, eleven leagues from the mouth of that river. The Russians, led by Czeremetoff, under whom the Czar served in person, in quality of lieutenant-general, had the imprudence to suffer them∣selves to be surrounded, in a narrow pass formed by the Pruth. Peter was now in the same desperate condition with Charles himself at Pultowa. But though he was equally unfortunate, he was more prudent. He desired to capitulate. He strengthened his request with large presents to the Vizier. He obtained advantageous terms, when he had nothing to expect but misfortune. Charles, who had declined to attend an army which he was not suffered to command, hearing of the situation of the Russians, hastened to the Ottoman camp. He arrived just in time to see his mortal enemy relieved from his dis∣tress. He reproached the Vizier. He demanded a de∣tachment

The Kings of Den∣mark and Poland entered Pomerania with their united forces. But their success was not answerable either to the fears of the Swedes, or their own expectations. Having sat down before Stralsund, they could make no impression on the place. They attacked Wismer, with no success. They retreated to their respective domini∣ons, and closed the campaign of 1711 with disgrace. In the summer of the present year, the King of Denmark turned his arms against the duchy of Bremen. He cross∣ed the Elbe, with a numerous army. He sat down be∣fore Stade. His troops, in the mean time, held Wismer in blockade. The Swedish general, Steinbock, assem∣bied his army, fortified Stralsund, and came to battle with the enemy. Though the Danes had all the advan∣tage of superior numbers, and of the weather and ground, they were totally routed and put to flight.

The hopes of the adherents of the Pretender, and the jealousies of the friends of the house of Hannover, were encouraged and fomented, with great industry, by the violent leaders of both sides. The year 1712 closed with the arrival of the Duke d'Aumont, as ambassador from the court of Versailles to that of London. Though the defection of Great Britain from the grand alliance promised a certain end to the war, the progress toward peace was made but by very slow degrees. The resolute conduct of the Bri∣tish ministry gradually overcame the delays of the allies. The Earl of Strafford, repairing to the Hague, with or∣ders from the Queen to settle a new barrier treaty with the States, induced the Republic to accede to the plan of sacification settled between Great Britain and France.

<MILESTONE N="1713" UNIT="year"/> Their example was successively followed by the Duke of Savoy and the King of Portugal. The first owed too much to the Queen to oppose longer her pacific measures.

The Queen, daily ex∣pecting the conclusion of the treaty, was willing to pre∣vent all further animadversion on its progress from the op∣posing party. In this state of suspence, a kind of un∣settled tranquillity prevailed. The Whigs made in se∣cret every preparation for opening, with effect, the ope∣rations of the political campaign. Disappointed in their violent measures, they resolved to pursue the line of op∣position, in a less dangerous and more legal way. The jealousy which they had raised in the court of Hannover, continued to distract the councils of the Electoral fami∣ly. Ignorant of the bigotry of the Pretender, they were beyond measure alarmed at the report of his intentions to change his religion. They were no strangers to the soli∣citations of the Tories to induce him to place himself in a way of being served in parliament. Should even the report of his conversion prevail, they were persuaded, that a bill to repeal the act of settlement was likely to be proposed. They were informed from Paris, that the pre∣tended Prince, by dismissing his Popish servants, was pre∣paring for an alteration in religion.

He was desired to dis∣cover his sentiments on the subject of a pension to the Princess Sophia. A provision, and even a houshold to the next heir of the crown, was thought neither an ex∣travagant nor unreasonable demand. In the present situ∣ation of the Elector's affairs, a fresh supply of revenue was much wanted. His agents every where complained of their too scanty allowance. The Whigs, with all their patriotism, were soliciting for pensions<NOTE N="Z" PLACE="foot">Ibid, 171<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. Some lords, who were zealous for the Protestant succession, were, it seems, too poor to follow their consciences. They had sold their votes to the ministry. But they would take smaller sums from his Electoral Highness. The Earl of Sunderland, in his attachment to the family of Brunswick, had advanced three hundred pounds to one of these poor conscientious lords<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.

indifferent concerning the succession of his family to the throne. Teazed by the unmeaning professions of the Tories, and harassed by the demands of the Whigs, he dropt all personal correspondence with both parties. He suffered his servants to continue their intrigues in London. He listened to their intelligence. But to the requisitions of his Whiggish friends for money he turned a deaf ear. He was, however, persuaded, at length, to order six hundred pounds to the Lord Fizwalter, to ena∣ble that needy peer to repay a debt of three hundred pounds to Sunderland<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">Hannover-papers, Feb. 14, 1713.</NOTE>. He allowed forty pounds to the author of a news-paper, for conveying to the public paragraphs favourable to the Protestant succession<NOTE N="E" PLACE="foot">Ibid. Feb. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>, 1713.</NOTE>. He added ten pounds to that sum, after various represen∣tations from his council and servants. The difficulty with which he was brought to grant such trifles, furnishes a strong proof that his Highness was either disgusted with such pitiful demands, or very indifferent with regard to the throne.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Marlbo∣rough a spy on the Pre∣tender.</NOTE> Whilst the Elector was harassed with demands of mo∣ney from London, the Duke of Marlborough suggested another article of expence, from his retreat at Antwerp. He informed his Highness of the necessity of having a spy in the Pretender's court, to observe the motions of that Prince. He offered, for fifty louis-d'ors a month, to find a proper person to execute that important service. He took, in the mean time, a part of this necessary function upon himself<NOTE N="F" PLACE="foot">Ibid. Feb. 21, 1713.</NOTE>. He conveyed some intelligence to the court of Hannover. But his want of information seems to prove, that his Grace was no longer trusted with the secrets of the excluded family. The servants and the friends of the Elector were ill informed concerning the Pretender. They were persuaded, that he was resolved to enter into the communion of the church of England. They heard, that he had left all his Roman Catholic ser∣vants at St. Germains, when he retired to Chalons sur Marne. That none but Protestants were in his train, but the Earl of Middleton, who had yielded to convenience, more than to conviction, in his conversion to the Romish faith. Their sears increased in proportion to their igno∣rance

of the Pretender's bigotry. They could not, for a moment, suppose, that he would sacrifice his prospect of the British throne to a speculative tenet of religion<NOTE N="G" PLACE="foot">Hannover-papers, March 21.</NOTE>. The excluded party in Great Britain harassed, at the same time, the Elector, with proposals of his invading the kingdom with a body of troops. They suggested, that, should the Dutch refuse a squadron of men of war, some ships of force might be obtained from Denmark. But the Elector rejected the scheme, as utterly improper, as well as impracticable<NOTE N="H" PLACE="foot">Ibid. March 7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Secret views of the Pretender, and of the treasurer.</NOTE> During these intrigues on the part of the court of Han∣nover, the agents of the Pretender were equally busy, and still more anxious, in their negociations and intrigues. He himself had retired from St. Germains, in the pre∣ceding summer. Having obtained a safe-conduct from the Emperor and the Duke of Lorrain, he now resided at Bar. Though he entertained suspicions of the Earl of Oxford, upon much better grounds than the house of Hannover, he built much on the affections of the Queen and the zeal of the Tories. The lord-treasurer, how∣ever, broke artfully the designs of the first. He frus∣trated the schemes of the latter, by dividing their coun∣cils. While the Dukes of Shrewsberry and Buckingham remained in the cabinet-council, he deemed justly that the Protestant succession was in danger. But he had re∣moved the first, by appointing him ambassador to France. The second was broken with infirmities, and weighed down with years. Oxford endeavoured, in the mean time, to gain the most moderate Whigs. He laid schemes for obtaining a moderate parliament. The sheriffs, prick∣ed for the counties, were of the low-church party. He endeavoured to impress the electors with the necessity of chusing such representatives as should favour the succession in the Protestant line. Though he was on the point of losing the Tories by this conduct, he was so unfortunate as not to gain the Whigs. While he made the most ve∣hement professions to the Electoral family, they were firmly persuaded, that he was an obstinate and deter∣mined Jacobite. Though he was courted by the Pre∣tender, that Prince knew him to be an inflexible Whig.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace of Utrecht.</NOTE> These secret intrigues on both sides fill a period re∣markable for no public transaction. The parliament con∣tinued to be prorogued, as the tedious negociations at Utrecht had not yet been brought to a close. Great Britain, who first began the negociation, was destined to conclude the treaty. The Duke of Shrewsberry and the Marquis de Torcy settled the plan of a general peace at Paris, which a courier carried to Utrecht, in the middle of March. The Portuguese and Dutch had already agreed to put an end to their part of the war. Others prepared to follow their example. On the twenty-se∣venth of March, the lord privy-seal and the Earl of Stafford acquainted the ministers of the allies, that they had appointed the thirty-first for signing a treaty of peace, and one of commerce, between the Queen of Great Britain and France. They requested, therefore, the plenipotentiaries of the confederates to be prepared, at the same time, to sign their respective treaties. The conditions of peace to be allowed to the Emperor and the Empire had been settled by the Queen of Great Bri∣tain and the French King. These were delivered, in form, to the Count Zinzendorff, his Imperial Majesty's minister. But the Emperor, yielding to his resentment, resolved to continue the war. The British and French plenipotentiaries were the first who signed for their re∣spective sovereigns. Their example was followed, in the space of a few hours, by the minister of the Duke of Savoy, and by those of Portugal and Prussia. The States were the last who signed the treaty; the French plenipotentiaries having insisted, that the ministers of such Princes as their master had acknowledged as Kings, should take place of the ambassadors of a republic<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot">Swift's four Years.

of the war could suggest no demands that were not likely to be granted, by an enemy reduced to the last extremity. The French nation, unsuccessful in all their efforts, were broken by disasters. Their sovereign, destitute of re∣sources for action, became timid and undecisive in his counsels. He had implored the pity of the confederates, in a manner that, by exposing his own weakness, contri∣buted to augment their demands. Instead of deriving spi∣rit from indignation and despair, the court of Versailles yielded to those unmanly complaints, that deprive even misfortune itself of regret. In this untoward state of their affairs, the fate of the house of Bourbon depended upon the Queen of Great Britain; and, as the humanity, which ought ever to be extended to private distress, is frequently sacrificed to utility in public transactions, she could scarce be blamed for making a more rigorous use of the advantages which fortune had placed in her hands.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and reflec∣tions.</NOTE> But though more splendid conditions might certainly have been obtained, the peace of Utrecht was neither dishonourable nor disadvantageous. Great Britain, it is true, bore the greatest part of the weight of the war. But she was manifestly the sole arbitress of peace. She imposed terms on the victors, as well as on the van∣quished. Without gratifying the pride of France, she checked the insolence of the confederates. She favoured those the most, who first acquiesced in the plan she pro∣posed. She treated with neglect, or punished with disap∣pointment, such as were either obstinate or slow. The advantages which she obtained for herself, though nei∣ther adequate to her victories nor her expence, were solid, and even splendid. She secured the dominion of the Mediterranean, by obtaining Gibraltar and Minorca. She strengthened her limits and extended her dominions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> America. She forced France to relinquish all preten∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ons to New soundland, to cede Hudson's Bay, and to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>eld St. Christopher's.

to the Duke of Savoy, whom, of all the allies, he hated the most.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">on the peace of Utrecht.</NOTE> With regard to the confederates, the most of them were highly satisfied, and none had any great reason to complain. The King of Prussia obtained all his demands. The Duke of Savoy was recompensed beyond his most sanguine hopes. He had obtained the cession of Savoy, the district of Nice, with all that he had received in Italy, from the Emperor Leopold. He was raised to the regal title and to the throne of Sicily; and he was eventually to succeed to the crown of Spain, in default of Philip the Fifth and his issue-male. The King of Portugal had con∣tributed little to the carrying on of the war, and his de∣mands from the peace were few, and, without hesitation, granted. Luxembourg, Namur, Charleroi, together with the other cities already in their possession, were given, as a barrier, to the States. Their commerce with France was placed on the foundation established by the tariff of 1664. With regard to the Empire, the Rhine was to form its limits on the side of France. All forti∣fications, either possessed or raised by the French, be∣yond that river, were to be restored to the Emperor, or destroyed. The kingdom of Naples and the dutchy of Milan were ceded for ever to his Imperial Majesty; and the rest of the dominions of Italy, that had changed mas∣ters in the course of the war, were to return to their for∣mer sovereigns. There was a considerable difference, it must be confessed, between these terms and those offered by France in the year 1709. But a change of circum∣stances may justify an alteration of sentiments. Without abandoning the project of reducing the too great power of the house of Bourbon, the British ministry might al∣lege, that there was an equal necessity for prescribing limits to the vast claims of the family of Austria.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Perilous situation of the Earl of Oxford.</NOTE> The lord-treasurer obtained a triumph over his ene∣mies, by concluding the treaty of Utrecht. But he still stood upon very dangerous ground. Distrusted equally by both sides, he was destitute of friends; and his whole security rested in the implacable jealousy of the two par∣ties, who were alike his enemies. In this tottering situa∣tion, he endeavoured to support himself, by flattering the Tories in private, and by taking publickly the ground of the Whigs. In the political farce, he was, in some
<PB N="533" REF="556"/>
measure, the sole actor; and the populace were the spec∣tators, who were to decide his merit, and even his fate. To the common people, the appeal of the rivals for power had been made, for many years. The terrors of the vulgar for Popery, and their principles in favour of the Protestant religion, had been the great support of the esta∣blished form of government. The bulk of the nation were hitherto favourable to the ministry. To retain their confidence was a matter of the last importance to the Earl of Oxford; as, by the triennial act, the present parlia∣ment was near its end. The Whigs, to influence the approaching elections, had propagated, with more assidu∣ity than success, an opinion, that the Queen and her ser∣vants were irrecoverably in the interest of the Pretender. To prevent the bad consequences of this dangerous im∣pression, was a measure of necessity; and it employed the whole attention of the leaders of the Tories.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He is hated by both par∣ties.</NOTE> The boldest and the least politic proposed the passing of a septennial bill, as the best and most decisive means of securing the continuance of their own power<NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1713.</NOTE>. The lord-treasurer was too timid, or, perhaps, too pru∣dent, to follow their advice. He perceived, that a mea∣sure so unpopular would deprive him of the support of the vulgar, and place an uncontrolable power in the hands of the high-flying Tories. The cabinet-council were his enemies. He knew, that the most vehement of those who supported his measures in the two houses, wished only for the continuance of their present influence in parliament: That, should they attain their purpose, they would be willing to join with his avowed enemies, the Whigs, and to send him to the Tower<NOTE N="L" PLACE="foot">Ibid. Feb. 1713</NOTE>. To amuse the Jacobites, he admitted the agents of the Pre∣tender into his conversation and privacy<NOTE N="M" PLACE="foot">Ibid. Feb. 27, 1713.</NOTE>. He en∣deavoured to persuade them, that all his measures tended to the accomplishment of their wishes and views. But he had the misfortune to be as little believed by the excluded family, as he was by the legal heirs of the crown. His caution, his slow measures, his mysterious character, were by no means calculated to create in others any confi∣dence in his conduct. His only hold of his power, was
<PB N="534" REF="557"/>
the ascendant which he obtained over the Queen. By terrifying that timid Princess with reports of danger, and by insinuating artfully, that she could be safe only in his own hands, he reduced her into a state of depen∣dence on himself, and generally subservient to all his designs<NOTE N="N" PLACE="foot">MSS. passim.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His secret views and intrigues.</NOTE> In one important instance, her habitual obedience to the minister is said to have yielded to her prejudices. To secure himself with the populace, the lord-treasurer resolved to take the ground of the Whigs. The danger of the Protestant succession, from the Queen and her ser∣vants, had been long a favourite topic with that party. They were at great pains to inform the public, that the courts of London and Hannover were upon the very worst terms. Though this was a notorious fact, they had hi∣therto found it difficult to persuade the populace on that head. To remove every impression of this kind, the mi∣nister formed a design of inducing the Queen to assure her parliament, in her speech from the throne, that the utmost harmony subsisted between her and the presump∣tive heirs of her crown. He even attempted to reconcile the Jacobites to the propriety of this measure. He told them, that should the house of Hannover, upon these assurances, desert the Whigs, that party, who were rea∣dy to sacrifice their professed principles to their passions, would declare for the Pretender. That this circumstance would ruin their importance with the populace; and ena∣ble the real friends of the excluded Prince to secure for him the succession<NOTE N="O" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, March 171<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/></NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen averse from the house of Hannover.</NOTE> Though the adherents of the Pretender were too zea∣lous and sanguine to be incredulous, they gave little faith to the assurances of the Earl of Oxford<NOTE N="P" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. But though they relied in nothing upon his attachment to their cause, they affected to place the utmost confidence in his mea∣sures. The Queen, however, was not so easily won to his project of assuring the nation of her zeal for the Pro∣testant succession. Either from a returning affection for her own family, or rendered averse from the interests o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the presumptive heirs of the crown, by the intrigues o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their agents in London, she, for some time, refused to
<PB N="535" REF="558"/>
make any mention at all of the house of Hannover in her speech<NOTE N="Q" PLACE="foot">Hannover-papers, May 16, 1713.</NOTE>. The lord-treasurer made the strongest re∣presentations against this unexpected resolution. He ap∣plied to her prudence. He alarmed her fears. He told her, that the safety of her government, and perhaps of her person, depended upon her quieting the minds of people with regard to the Protestant succession. That her silence upon the present occasion, would confirm the reports industriously spread by the Whigs. That, by ex∣pressing zeal for the family of Hannover, she would de∣feat the designs of their adherents; and that by taking the only ground upon which the Whigs fortified them∣selves against her authority, she would reap all the be∣nefit of their situation, and ensure to her servants every advantage in the approaching elections<NOTE N="R" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">April 9th. Her speech to her par∣liament.</NOTE> Swayed by these arguments, or yielding to her own fears, the Queen at length consented. She opened the session of parliament, on the ninth of April, with a speech from the throne. She informed the two houses that the negociations of peace were brought to a happy conclusion. She mentioned what she had done for the security of the Protestant succession. She expressed her hopes, that the perfect friendship which subsisted between her and the house of Hannover, would effectually disappoint such persons as made a merit of separating their interests. She demanded of the commons the necessary supplies. She earnestly recommended the cultivating of the arts of peace, as the best means for repairing the losses sustained by the enormous expence of the war. She complained of the licence of the press, and the dangerous growth of the impious practice of duelling. She mentioned the neces∣sity of restraining both these evils, with new laws; as the old were inadequate to that salutary purpose. She left, she said, the force necessary for the protection of the nation, to the wisdom of her parliament. As for her∣self she wanted no protection but the loyalty of her peo∣ple; no guarantee but the interest she had in their hearts. Having recommended unanimity in their councils, and re∣quested them to use their endeavours to calm the minds of her people, she concluded with a reflection on the
<PB N="536" REF="559"/>
party-rage which had so long disturbed the repose of her kingdom<NOTE N="S" PLACE="foot">Journals, April 9th, 1713.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Whigs disconcerted</NOTE> This judicious speech disconcerted the Whigs in all their projects. In the house of commons an address of thanks was voted, with but one dissenting voice<NOTE N="T" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers</NOTE>. It was carried with a great majority in the house of lords<NOTE N="U" PLACE="foot">78 against 43.</NOTE>. Disappointed in their public exhibitions, the party had recourse to their secret intrigues. Sunderland, Orford, Townshend, Halifax, Somers, Cowper, and the Lord-Chief-Justice Parker, consulted together for two days<NOTE N="W" PLACE="foot">Hannover-papers, 1713.</NOTE>. But they could contrive no probable means for preventing the Lord-treasurer's designs. The Lords Townshend and Halisax went twice, in the name of the rest, to Kreyenberg, the Hannoverian resident. They affirmed, that the Queen's speech had given a fatal blow to the influence of the Whigs, and the Protestant succession. That the authority of the Sovereign had overturned all the designs of their party. That the nation gave impli∣cit credit to the Queen; and construed into party-rage all insinuations against the existence of a perfect friendship between her and the court of Hannover. That the Elector only could undeceive the people. That, there∣fore, a decisive step was necessary; otherwise, the inte∣rests of his family and the hopes of his friends would be for ever lost<NOTE N="X" PLACE="foot">Ibid April 14, 1713.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their in∣trigues with the Hanno∣verian resi∣dent.</NOTE> In this distressful situation, they implored Kreyenberg to lay their humble solicitations at the feet of the Elector. They entreated his Highness, for the sake of God<NOTE N="Y" PLACE="foot">Hannover-papers, 1713.</NOTE>, to send over the Electoral Prince. Without the presence of one of the family, they solemnly averred, that the suc∣cession must inevitably be defeated. This request they had frequently made, to no purpose, before the meeting of parliament. They now renewed their entreaties with more confidence, as their own condition was more help∣less, and the juncture itself more favourable. They de∣sired the Prince to take advantage of the Queen's decla∣ration. To feign to believe her sincere, and to come under pretence of returning thanks in person. They said, that without his presence, they could move nothing
<PB N="537" REF="560"/>
effectually in parliament. That they could not even mention the pension expected for the Princess Sophia. That the only question of party they could propose, was the removal of the Pretender from Lorrain. "But," say they, <Q REND="inline">"if the Electoral family shall not interfere decisively, the Earl of Oxford will save us the trouble of that motion.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceedings of the com∣mons.</NOTE> While the Whigs were thus disconcerted, the ministry carried all their measures, with little opposition, in par∣liament. Though no communication of the treaty had been made to the two houses, they had returned general thanks for the peace. The commons granted the de∣manded supplies<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Journals, April 13.</NOTE>. They reduced the troops and navy, according to the directions of the court. They gained the army, by allowing half-pay to the officers. They secured their influence with their constituents, by reducing the land-tax to two shillings in the pound. In the midst of this attention to the nation, they shewed their attachment to the ministry. The commissioners for examining the accounts of the army made a report that bore hard on former mismanagements. Some instances of corruption and embezzlement of public money were detected. But it soon appeared that the house was more eager to expose the enemies of the prevailing party, than to punish the guilty. One William Churchill, a mem∣ber, was slightly censured. A vote was passed against the Earl of Wharton, for having sold an office for a thousand pounds. But, as this instance of corruption happened before the act of general pardon, the house took advan∣tage of that circumstance, and resolved to proceed no farther in the matter<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">May 16.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Treaty of commerce before the house.</NOTE> This appearance of unanimity in the house of com∣mons, was soon interrupted, by an important debate. Though the terms of the treaty had not hitherto been communicated to parliament, the proclamation of the peace, on the fifth of May, had been attended with the loudest acclamations of the populace. The nation in ge∣neral
<PB N="538" REF="561"/>
were highly pleased, that a period was put to a war whose excessive weight had rendered them insensible to its renown. The treaty which settled the cession of ter∣ritories between her Britannic Majesty and the French King, was accompanied by a treaty of commerce between Great Britain and France. The ratifications of the two treaties had been exchanged at Utrecht, on the twenty-eighth of April. On the ninth of May, Mr. Benson, chancellor of the exchequer, delivered to the commons a message from the Queen. She informed the house, that though it was the undoubted prerogative of the crown to make peace and war, she had resolved from the beginning to communicate to her parliament the treaties she had now concluded<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">Journals, May 9th.</NOTE>. The house appointed the fourteenth of May, for resolving themselves into a grand committee, to consider the eighth and ninth articles of the treaty of navagation and commerce. A conversation, rather than a debate, passed between the parties, on the treaty of peace. The Whigs found, in the treaty of commerce, the best ground for opposing the court, with any prospect of success.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arguments for and a∣gainst it.</NOTE> When the house met, on the fourteenth of May, a motion was made to bring in a bill to make good the eighth and ninth articles of the treaty of commerce. A violent debate arose between the friends of the minister and the leaders of the Whigs. The first endeavoured to prove, that a great advantage would result to the nation from a free commerce with France. The latter affirmed, that a trade with that kingdom would prove extremely pre∣judicial to the woollen, silk, and paper manufactories; and above all, to the commerce with Portugal, which brought annually so much bullion into the kingdom. The friends of the ministry deduced their arguments from an enumeration of the vast quantities of British commodi∣ties exported to France before the two last wars. The Whigs averred that since the Revolution, the state of commerce was entirely changed. That France had set up and encouraged woollen manufactures of her own. That Britain had learned, in the course of so many years to accommodate herself without the product of France<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> That the French, having the work performed for les<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> money, could sell their goods at a cheaper rate. That<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="539" REF="562"/>
should Britain even be capable of balancing her own trade with France, she could not prevent the latter king∣dom from engrossing the commerce of other countries. That the increase of the trade to Portugal, the most valua∣ble branch of British commerce, was owing to the high duties, which amounted to a kind of prohibition of French wines. That should the duties on these wines be reduced to an equality with those on the wines of Portugal, the trade with that kingdom would be lost; as men in gene∣ral would prefer the wines of France, when they could be purchased at the same rate<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">Debates, printed.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bill con∣cerning it rejected.</NOTE> The adherents of the ministry advanced arguments equally solid and conclusive. But when parties are in∣flamed against each other, passion decides in the place of reason. Upon a division of the house, the bill was or∣dered to be introduced, by a great majority<NOTE N="E" PLACE="foot">252 against 130.</NOTE>. The Whigs, adhering to their purpose of distressing the minis∣ter, called the prejudices of the nation to their aid. They carried their arguments to the press. The lord-treasurer opposed them, on the same ground. But the fate of the bill was not ultimately determined by this public contest. Many of the Tories, to the last degree offended at the trimming conduct of the Earl of Oxford, had resolved to join the Whigs, on the present occasion, to accomplish his ruin. Sir Thomas Hanmer, though he had been in∣strumental in concluding the treaty of commerce, opposed it, with vehemence, as the best ground for affronting the lord-treasurer. He was at the head of a society of forty members of the house of commons, who called them∣selves the October-club. This junto resolved to throw their whole weight in the scale of the opposing party; and to terrify the Earl of Oxford into decisive measures for the Pretender. They had frequently requested him, in vain, to remove the Whigs from the lieutenancy of the counties, the commissions of the peace, and the offices of the revenue. He had repeatedly made the most solemn promises upon this subject. But though the dissolution of parliament was approaching, he had hitherto done no∣thing in an affair upon which the success of the Tories, at the new elections, so much depended<NOTE N="F" PLACE="foot">Stu∣art-papers, June 23, 1713.</NOTE>. When, there∣fore, the bill was brought to a debate, the most violent of

the Tories, led by Hanmer, opposed its being engrossed; and, upon a division of the house, carried their point, by a majority of nine votes<NOTE N="G" PLACE="foot">194 against 185.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Discontents of the Scots.</NOTE> During the dependence of this bill, another matter of still greater importance employed the attention of parli∣ament. The house of commons, in renewing the duty on malt, for another year, extended that tax to Scotland. The members for that part of the kingdom, unanimously opposed the measure. They complained, that the duty, in itself too great a burden for their country, was contra∣ry to an express article of the Union between the king∣doms. That it had been stipulated by that treaty, that no duty should be laid on malt in North-Britain during the continuance of the war. That, though hostilities had ceased, no formal peace was yet concluded with Spain. That, though a pacification between the two crowns was no longer a matter of uncertainty, yet it was a maxim in law, that odious things were to be literally understood; but that matters of favour were to be in∣terpreted with more liberality. That as the tax itself was, by the express words of the bill, to be applied to deficiencies in the war, this act laid an impost on the Scots, from which they were evidently exempted by the treaty of Union<NOTE N="H" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. iv.</NOTE>. These arguments made a great impression on the house; but, on a division, a majority appeared on the side of the bill. The Scotish members, in both houses of parliament, were so much offended, that they met at a tavern, and having appointed two lords and two commoners to wait, in their name, upon the Queen, they requested her permission for bringing in a bill for the dissolution of the Union<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot">MSS passim.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of the Duke of Argyle.</NOTE> Though the Queen expressed the greatest uneasiness at the address of the Scots, they resolved to proceed in their intended motion. Several of the Jacobite part of the Tories entered with eagerness into a measure, which was well calculated to distress the Earl of Oxford. The Whigs, for the like reason, were ready to throw their weight into the same scale. But the person who ani∣mated the whole opposition, on this subject, was the Duke of Argyle. This nobleman, espousing the princi∣ples
<PB N="541" REF="564"/>
or passions of his family, had uniformly professed his attachment to the Protestant succession, and his con∣sequent aversion to a minister who was deemed to favour the Pretender. Careless and eager in his disposition, he neither concealed his resentment nor disguised his designs. With a commanding manner, which stamped his very forwardness with an appearance of authority, he was feared by many, but beloved by none. Brave in his per∣son, but not remarkable for his conduct, he might be considered, in his military capacity, as a bold partizan, rather than a judicious commander. In his civil cha∣racter, his fire degenerated into a violence, that often defeated his views. In his public exhibitions in parlia∣ment, he was rather spirited than eloquent; better calcu∣lated to terrify his enemies, than to support his friends. His great defect was a love of money and emolument, which he could not effectually conceal, with all the ef∣forts of his pride<NOTE N="J" PLACE="foot">Hannover and Stuart-papers, 1713.</NOTE>. His chief talent was an address in managing the prejudices of the vulgar. He marked their opinions as they changed, and fell dextrously down with the tide.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Motion for dissolving the Union</NOTE> The Earl of Oxford, no stranger to the importance of the Duke of Argyle, had resolved to gain him by promises of advantage. His object was to place him as a kind of spy upon the Whigs, and to terrify, upon occasion, that party, by his means<NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">Stuart-pa∣pers, 1713.</NOTE>. But the Duke declined to en∣ter into the views of the minister, till he should obtain the office of master-general of the ordnance, vacant by the death of the Duke of Hamilton, The lord-treasurer was unwilling to trust a place of such importance in the hands of a man whom interest only could gain to his side. Disappointment heightened the Duke's resentment. He resolved to gain by force what he could not obtain by fa∣vour. He opposed the court with vehemence. He treated the minister with insult. He therefore entered, with great zeal, into the counsels of his countrymen, for the dissolution of the union between the two kingdoms. To carry a point of such great importance, was likely to introduce a confusion into the measures of government, that would prove fatal to the power of the Earl of Ox∣ford.
<PB N="542" REF="565"/>
The resentment of the most violent Jacobites kept pace with the warmth and vehemence of the Whigs. Both resolved to ruin the lord-treasurer, as each looked upon him in the light of an enemy. They flattered, therefore, the prejudices and fomented the resentment of the Scotish members<NOTE N="L" PLACE="foot">MSS. 1713.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">rejected by a small ma∣jority.</NOTE> On the first of June, the Earl of Finlater, having re∣counted, in the house of lords, the various grievances resulting to the Scotish nation from the Union, concluded with a motion for dissolving that treaty. Finlater was seconded by the Earl of Mar. The debate became gene∣ral on this important subject. But the force of argument was less apparent, on both sides, than the irreconcilable spirit of the two parties. The violence of Argyle against the Earl of Oxford was ultimately serviceable to that mi∣nister, at the same time that it contributed to defeat his own designs. The Duke having, in the course of the debate, mentioned, with the utmost contempt, the Pre∣tender, offended some lords, who secretly favoured his cause. Though they were willing to humble the Earl of Oxford, they were averse from the principles of his more open enemies. Two bishops, in particular, who possessed, between them, three proxies, by quitting the house<NOTE N="M" PLACE="foot">MSS. passim, 1713.</NOTE>, carried five votes from the Scots and Whigs. When the question for bringing in the bill was put, it was carried in the negative, by a majority of four voices. A circumstance, which preserved the kingdom from confu∣sion, was highly favourable to the Earl of Oxford. Had the motion been carried in the affirmative, it was to have been followed by another, for sending the treasurer to the Tower<NOTE N="N" PLACE="foot">Ibid. Hannover and Stuart-papers, 1713.</NOTE>. The Scots, disappointed by their want of success, and incensed by the speech of Argyle, fell again into the views of the court.

he was proscribed by the Whigs. The irreconcilable ani∣mosity of the two parties had been hitherto the only sup∣port of his power. The predominancy of either was to him alike destructive. His prudence was now in arms against his principles. The most direct way to preserve his authority, was to gratify the more violent Tories, by abetting the views of the Pretender. But even that ob∣vious path was beset with difficulties and dangers. Should his measures assume the appearance of Jacobitism, the jealousy of the people against Popery might throw them into the scale of the Whigs. To retain the favour of the populace, was now as necessary as to regain the support of the Tories. He had, therefore, recourse to the old ex∣pedient of giving private assurances to the Jacobites, while he marked his public conduct with a zeal for the house of Hannover. Though this artifice was too stale to deceive the Tories, the Whigs shewed such an intemperate joy for their success in the affair of the treaty of commerce, that the former resolved to support a minister they hated, to exclude a party whom they had great reason to fear<NOTE N="O" PLACE="foot">MSS. passim.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceedings of parlia∣ment.</NOTE> Impressed with this opinion, such Tories as had op∣posed the treaty of commerce endeavoured to give a proof of their resolution to change their conduct. Sir Thomas Hanmer, by whose influence the bill was rejected, moved for a palliative address to the Queen, approving of the treaties of peace and commerce. His motion was carried by a great majority<NOTE N="P" PLACE="foot">156 against 72.</NOTE>. The Queen's answer was full of art and address. She thanked the commons for their approbation of the treaty of commerce. She stated its advantages, and the great difficulties with which it had been obtained. The treasurer, by this victory over his enemies, became more important in the eyes of his party and supposed friends. He resolved to profit by their zeal. On the twenty-fifth of June, a message from the Queen was presented to the commons, by the chancellor of the Exchequer. This message imported, that the civil list, prior to the year 1710, when the late changes in the ministry happened, had run greatly in arrear. That her Majesty, therefore, requested the house to enable her to raise a sum sufficient to pay her debts upon the funds of the civil list. As the message contained a kind of reflec∣tion
<PB N="544" REF="567"/>
upon the former ministry, the consequent motion was opposed with great vehemence by the Whigs. But they found, upon this occasion, that their late triumphs were not owing to themselves. A bill, empowering the Queen to raise five hundred and ten thousand pounds, for the payment of the debts of the civil list, passed the house, by a great majority. The Whigs complained, that advantage had been taken of the absence of many of their party, who had retired into the country when the business of the treaty of commerce was finished<NOTE N="Q" PLACE="foot">Journals.

The pension to the Princess Sophia was not proposed, though the success of that measure might have furnished the Elector with an opportunity of enabling some NEEDY LORDS<NOTE N="R" PLACE="foot">Hannover-papers, 1713.</NOTE> to follow their conscience. To shew their attachment to the Protestant succession, or, more probably, to harass the Queen and her ministry, who were considered as averse from the house of Hannover, the Whigs resolved to move for an address, that the most pressing instances should be used with the Duke of Lor∣rain to remove from his dominions the Pretender to the crown of Great Britain. This motion was opposed in the house of lords by none but the Lord North. The com∣mons voted the address, without one dissenting voice. This spirit of compliance defeated the views of the Whigs. They hoped, that their political enemies would have the imprudence to outvote them in their motion. That this circumstance would, to use their own expression<NOTE N="S" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>, open the eyes of the nation.

She hop∣ed, at the next meeting, the affair of commerce would be so well understood, that the advantageous conditions obtained from France might be rendered effectual to her people, by law. She expressed how sensible she was of the affection, zeal, and duty of the commons. She re∣counted their former services. She enlarged upon their late favours. She acknowledged her gratitude for their having furnished her with supplies for continuing the war, and for strengthening her hands in obtaining peace. She said, that at her coming to the crown, she found a war prepared to her hands. That God had blessed her arms with many victories in that war, which she had improved, by procuring an advantageous and honourable peace. She requested her parliament to make the people sensible of what they had gained by the late treaties.

They observed, that, in the whole speech, no mention was made of the Pretender, none of the Protestant succession. But they were most offended at the contempt with with which she treated the opposing party, and the impression which she gave to the nation of their conduct and views. The adherents of the Whigs carried their arguments and complaints to the press. The Tories and the ministry descended to meet their ad∣versaries in the same field. The nation was overwhelm∣ed with essays, papers, and pamphlets. Assertions, with∣out proof, were on both sides improved into facts; and a suspicious people were rendered unhappy, by the arti∣fice and clamour of contending knaves.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Intrigues and dissensi∣ons in the cabinet.</NOTE> The speech, that gave so much offence to the Whigs, seems to have been fabricated without the advice of the Earl of Oxford. Though he was the ostensible minister, he guided no longer the cabinet. When he was, in a manner, proscribed by the two contending parties in par∣liament, he was violently attacked in the closet. The Viscount Bolingbroke, who had, from the beginning, traversed his measures, had long fixed his eyes upon his power. Having gained the Lady Masham, by gratify∣ing her passion for the public money, he insinuated him∣self into the favour of the Queen, by entering, without hesitation, into all her prejudices. The lord-treasurer was equally hated by both the great parties. The Whigs pretended that he did too much, the violent Tories found that he had done nothing, for the Pretender.

to place himself at the head of an independent party<NOTE N="Y" PLACE="foot">Oxford to Queen Anne, June 9, 1714.</NOTE>. The mortifications, which the treasurer ex∣perienced, proceeded from the machinations of his rival, more than from the inveteracy of his enemies.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Secret ca∣bals and</NOTE> During these intrigues in the cabinet, the Whigs con∣tinued their own secret cabals. In their eagerness for power, they persuaded themselves that the Protestant succession was in danger. They continued their solicita∣tions to the Elector of Brunswick, to send to Great Bri∣tain the Electoral Prince. They had represented, in the strongest and most decisive terms, that the Queen and her servants were irrecoverably attached to the Pretender. They threw his Highness, in the affair of the Succession, into a despondence, that degenerated into a kind of des∣pair. He became careless and indifferent about a throne, which was represented so difficult to ascend. To humour, however, those who called themselves his friends, he agreed, at length, to send his brother, Duke Ernest, to Great Britain. The Whigs, disappointed by this propo∣sal, formed an opinion, that his Highness was jealous of the influence which might be acquired by his son, in Great Britain. They requested him, therefore, to come in person. But he absolutely refused to comply with a demand, that seemed, at once impracticable in itself and inconsistent with his own dignity<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Hannover-papers, 1713.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">intrigues of the Whigs.</NOTE> Though the backwardness of the Elector threw a damp on his party, his servants continued, with a degree of eagerness, a correspondence with the Whigs. His High∣ness having positively declared, that he would not risk an expedition into Britain in a hostile manner, prior to the Queen's death, his ministers had begun to take pre∣cautions in expectation of that event. They had sent, early in the year, several queries to the leaders of the Whigs. The answers which were to form the line of their conduct, were given, by the lords Somers, Cow∣per, and Halifax. They declared, that no commission,
<PB N="548" REF="571"/>
granted either by the Princess Sophia or the Elector could be valid, should these be signed and executed during the Queen's life. They declined for themselves to act upon authorities neither established by precedents nor appointed by law. The Duke of Marlborough and General Cado∣gan, who signified their inclination to have the eventual command of the troops, were not so scrupulous. They declared, that a writing in French, without any adherence to forms, would be sufficient. That the authority of the Duke of Marlborough was so great among the soldiers, that any piece of parchment was enough to ensure their obedience to his command. As for Cadogan, he wished only for a show of authority to take possession of the Tower, or to place himself in conjunction with the Electoral Prince at the head of the British troops, that still lay in garrison in some cities in Flanders<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">Hannover papers passim, 1713.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They de∣mand mo∣ney in vain from the Elector.</NOTE> The Whigs had, in the beginning of the year, harass∣ed the Elector with demands of pensions for poor lords. They had perpetually teazed his Highness for money to political writers and for spies planted round the Pretender. Though their solicitations on these subjects had been at∣tended with little success, they continued to make appli∣cations of the same disagreeable kind. When the session was drawing to a conclusion and a dissolution was fore∣seen, they demanded one hundred thousand pounds from the Elector, to corrupt boroughs, to influence the elec∣tions, and to return men of constitutional and Whiggish principles to the ensuing parliament<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. The magni∣tude of the sum left no room for hesitation in rejecting their request. One repulse, however, was not sufficient either to intimidate or discourage a party so eager in the pursuit of their designs. They diminished their demand to fifty thousand pounds. The Elector plainly told them, that he could not spare the money. That he had done the greatest service, consistent with his own particular si∣tuation and the state of Europe in general, to the well affected in Great Britain. That he had engaged the Emperor and Empire to continue the war against France. That he employed seventeen thousand of his troops against that kingdom.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Situation and views of the Preten∣der.</NOTE> During these intrigues for the Protestant succession, the Pretender lived in great security at Bar-le-duc, under the protection of the Duke of Lorrain. Though he had declined to change his religion at the solicitation of his adherents, his servants were almost all of the Protestant persuasion. The Earl of Middleton, who had yielded to policy more than conviction, his former system of faith, was the only Roman Catholic of any consequence in his train<NOTE N="E" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 1713.</NOTE>. A clergyman of the church of England had come from Britain at his desire, to exercise the func∣tions of his order in his family<NOTE N="F" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1713.</NOTE>. In daily expectati∣on of a change in his favour, he declined all correspon∣dence, except such as solely conveyed intelligence of the state of opinions and the secret intrigues in government. The same distrust of the lord treasurer that prevailed at Hannover, was entertained, with much more reason, at Bar-le-duc. But both agreed in the opinion, that his own safety would, at length, induce the Earl of Oxford to throw himself in the scale of the Pretender. The ad∣herents of that Prince placed, however, their greatest hopes in the inclinations of Queen Anne. They knew that an interior cabinet was formed in opposition to the trimming conduct of the lord treasurer. That Boling∣broke, who had long hated that nobleman, had flattered the prejudices of the Queen and her favourite, to ruin the minister. That the latter had applied to the principal Whigs for protection against his colleagues in office<NOTE N="G" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.

That to accomplish this great design, nothing was necessary, but to remain on the defensive, on the Rhine. That to make conquests was of much less im∣portance than to maintain the show of war; and, that even slight disasters might be of service, as they would contribute to alarm the British nation, by the progress made by the arms of France<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot">Stuart and Hannover-papers, passim, 1713.</NOTE>.</P>

Foreseeing the event that deprived him of the aid of his allies, he had accommodated the differences which had long subsisted between his family and the malecontents in Hungary. Preliminary articles, containing a general amnesty on both sides, had been followed by a formal treaty. The fa∣mous Ragotski, disappointed in his views, had fled to Poland, and twenty-two regiments of Hungarians, taking the oaths to the Emperor, passed into his army. The Prince of Savoy commanded the Imperialists. When he was making preparations for passing, with great caution, the Rhine, he was suddenly stopt, by the approach of a superior force, under the Mareschal de Villars. The French had acquired their usual confidence, by the de∣sertion of the maritime powers from the grand confede∣racy. They took Worms, Spire, Keiserlauter, and other places, with little resistance. They invested and

took the important fortress of Landau. Villars, having formed greater designs, forced the passage of the Rhine, attacked and defeated the General Vaubonne, in his in∣trenchments, and took Fribourg, before the end of the campaign.

To influence the electi∣ons, they had long carried their disputes to the press. Each endeavoured, by their writers, to impose upon a credulous multitude. Positive assertions were advanced, according to custom, as facts; and declamation was sub∣stituted in the place of argument. The Whigs, disap∣pointed in their expectations of money from Hannover, had endeavoured to gain the mob of London, through their habitual prejudices against the French. The ter∣rors from the Pretender were inculcated, in vain, against the positive assurances of the Queen, in favour of the Protestant succession. The imprudence and inattention of the Duke d'Aumont, the French ambassador, had fur∣nished the discontented with an opportunity of inflaming the populace against his nation, and consequently against the ministry. To gain popularity, that minister had, upon his entrance into London, strewed whole handfuls of silver coin among the rabble. Their acclamations end∣ed with his generosity. The crowds, whom their avarice had assembled before his house, disappointed in their ex∣pectations, gave free vent to their aversion to France and Popery. They were easily induced to connect the inte∣rests of the Pretender with the objects of d'Aumont's em∣bassy; and thus the Whigs contrived to instill a jealousy into the populace, to favour their own interests in the ge∣neral elections.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Duke of Shrewsberry lord lieuto∣nant.</NOTE> The Duke of Shrewsberry, upon his arrival at Dublin, found the city in a ferment concerning the election of a lord mayor. The Whigs and Jacobites carried their con∣test, on this subject, to a degree of violence little short of frenzy. The latter were supported, with great zeal and address, by Sir Constantine Phipps, lord-chancellor of the kingdom, who was at no pains to conceal his attach∣ment to the Pretender and his cause. The Duke of Shrewsberry profited by the violence of Phipps. He concealed, with success, his own principles in favour of the hereditary descent of the crown. He averred, in public, that he was still the same, he was in the year 1688. He drank, with an appearance of zeal, to the pious memory of King William; though it is well known he deserted the cause of that Prince when alive. On the anniversary of King William's birth-day, his Duchess, then in correspondence with the excluded family, gave a magnificent ball, and flattered the principles of the Whigs upon the occasion. The elections for members of a new parliament were, in the mean time, carried on with industry, contention, and animosity. The two parties of Whigs and Tories, as in Great Britain opposed each other with violence, and even bloodshed. The troops were obliged to interfere in the elections for the city of Dublin, where force only could suppress the un∣governable fury of the voters, on both sides<NOTE N="R" PLACE="foot">Publications of the Times.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceedings of the Irish parliament.</NOTE> Though the advantage was visible, on the side of the Whigs, in the Irish elections, the Tories formed a nu∣merous party in the house of commons. Upon a division, on the choice of a speaker, the former were found to posses only a majority of four votes. In the house of lords the interest of the latter seemed to prevail. The violence that had subsisted without doors, was carried into the debates and resolutions of the lower house. They
<PB N="554" REF="577"/>
inquired into the late riots in Dublin. They examined into the prosecutions in the court of Queen's Bench against the authors and printers of some treasonable pub∣lications. The object of the Whigs was to attack the Lord Chancellor Phipps; who being at the head of the law, was averse from exerting its rigour against writers, who favoured his own principles. The commons re∣solved, that a book, intitled, "Memoirs of the Che∣valier de St. George," was a scandalous and seditious libel. That the design of that libel was to impeach her Majesty's title to the crown, and the succession of the house of Hannover. That Sir Constantine Phipps, lord-chancellor of Ireland, had acted contrary to his duty and the Protestant interest, by representing the author as an object of the Queen's mercy. That the lord-chancellor had, in a speech to the lord mayor and aldermen of Dub∣lin<NOTE N="S" PLACE="foot">Jan 12, 1712.</NOTE>, by declaring his opinion, prejudiced a cause de∣pending in a court of law. That, therefore, an address should be presented to her Majesty to remove Sir Con∣stantine Phipps from his place of lord-high chancellor, for the peace and safety of her Protestant subjects in Ire∣land<NOTE N="T" PLACE="foot">Journals, Dec. 18, 1713.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They ani∣madvert on the lord-chancellor.</NOTE> In the house of lords, principles similar to those of the chancellor, combining with the weight of government, obtained votes of an opposite kind. They resolved, that Sir Constantine Phipps had, in the several stations where∣in he had served her Majesty, acquitted himself with ho∣nour and integrity. That a committee should immedi∣ately withdraw, and prepare an address to her Majesty, on the subject of these votes. The commons, offended at the resolutions of the lords, extended further censures to the conduct of Phipps. They accused him openly of abetting the views of the Jacobites, from his refusing his approbation, as chancellor, of a person elected lord mayor of Dublin, merely because that person was at∣tached to the principles of the late Revolution. The flame could be only extinguished by a prorogation. The Duke of Shrewsberry, apprized of the declining health of the Queen, was willing, of himself, to put a period to the contests in Ireland, and to return to London. Though the indiscreet Jacobitism of the lord chancellor
<PB N="555" REF="578"/>
merited censure, the conduct of the Irish commons was much blamed by the British Tories. The figure which Phipps had made at the trial of Doctor Sacheverell, had gained the affection of the church-party. The Whigs were loud on the other side of the question; and the truth is, that the chancellor had been, in some measure, the cause of unhappy distinctions between the Protestants of Ireland.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Domestic affairs.</NOTE> During these transactions in Ireland, the ferment raised in Britain, by the arts of the two parties, continued. Though the Tories were, in general, the most success∣ful, more Whigs found their way into the house of com∣mons in the present than in the preceding elections. The new parliament, which was to have met on the twelfth of November, was further prorogued to the tenth of De∣cember. This measure was, at the time, ascribed to the manifest decline of the Queen's health and the squab∣bles among her servants. The Earl of Oxford, having received a repulse from the Whigs, in the month of August<NOTE N="U" PLACE="foot">Hannover-papers, 1713.</NOTE>, had endeavoured to regain the confidence of the Tories. To gratify their prejudices, some changes were made in the principal departments of the state. To influence the elections in their favour, some alterations were made in the inferior offices of the revenue. With regard to the first, men, remarkable for the Tory prin∣ciple, were placed in eminent stations, which had been rendered vacant by deaths, dismissions, or removals. The Earl of Mar, then actually in correspondence with the Pretender, was made third secretary of state. The Earl of Dartmouth, having received the privy seal, made a vacancy for Mr. William Bromley, as one of her Ma∣jesty's principal secretaries. Sir William Wyndham be∣came chancellor of the exchequer, in the room of Robert Benson, raised to the peerage, by the title of Lord Bing∣ley. The Lord Lansdowne, in his principles a Jacobite, had received the place of treasurer of the household, which had been for some time vacant by the removal of the Earl of Cholmondeley, the last Whig of any import∣ance that remained in office<NOTE N="X" PLACE="foot">Gazettes, August and Sept. 1713.</NOTE>.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dissensions between the Queen's servants.</NOTE> Whilst the lord-treasurer endeavoured to gain the To∣ries by these changes, he only strengthened the hands of his enemies against himself. Bolingbroke, encouraged by the accession of Secretary Bromley and Sir William Wyndham, continued his intrigues in the cabinet. The animosities between the members of administration were no longer unknown to the public. The writers employ∣ed by government were busy in preparing the nation for an approaching change<NOTE N="Y" PLACE="foot">Nov. 16.</NOTE>. The Earl of Oxford him∣self, though fond of the distinction paid to his high sta∣tion, was displeased at being deprived of its power. He thought seriously of retiring from business. But there was now no safety in retreating. He had too much of∣fended the Whigs, to be either forgot or forgiven by that party. The Tories, should he join with their political enemies, would seek an opportunity, and they actually possessed the means of revenge. In this state of affairs, he sacrificed his pride to necessity. He resolved to bear with mortifications, rather than resign his office. His indignation against his rival might contribute to his pre∣sent firmness. He saw, that the very person who had already ruined his interest with the Queen, wished to de∣prive him of the influence with the nation, which he still derived from his office<NOTE N="Z" PLACE="foot">MSS. passim.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Secret in∣trigues of Bolingbroke</NOTE> The enmity subsisting between the treasurer and his rival in influence, was greatly fomented by the uninter∣rupted connexion between the latter and the Duke of Marlborough. The Duke, not remarkable for friendly attachments, seemed to have departed from the usual in∣difference of his character, with regard to the Viscount Bolingbroke. He is said to have declared, upon the death of the Marquis of Blandford, that he had now no comfort left in the world, except in Henry St. John, whom he regarded and loved as his own son<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">MSS. passim.</NOTE>.

Marlborough, gratified his own ambition, by accepting the office of secretary of state. When, therefore, the Duke was on the worst terms with the court, he had a friend in the cabinet, who supported his interest when the current was not too strong to be stemmed. When the dangerous intrigues of Marlborough, in the end of 1711, furnished the lord-treasurer with an opportunity of re∣moving him from all his employments, St. John yielded to the times, and approved of a measure which he could not oppose<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">Original Papers, passim.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He takes advantage of the Queen's state of mind</NOTE> The difficult situation of the Earl of Oxford, the per∣petual contest between his interest and principles, his aukward manner, and a conduct throughout undecisive, soon rendered him obnoxious to the Tories, and hated by the Whigs. He, however, retained, throughout the year 1712, his influence with his sovereign, by finding means to persuade that timid Princess, that he himself was necessary to her safety, against the dangerous designs of the Whigs. When time had expunged from her me∣mory a part of her fears, she began to listen to the insinua∣tions of Bolingbroke against the treasurer. Subject to frequent illnesses, and sensible of the decay of her own constitution, she became apprehensive that she was fast approaching to her end. An enthusiast, like the most of her family, she became anxious for the eventual succes∣sion of her brother to the throne, from motives of religion. Her solemn promises to her father, a letter written to her by that Prince in his last illness<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">Hannover-papers, 1713.</NOTE>, her having been, by her desertion, the obvious cause of his ruin<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">Her letter to her father.

Having flattered her prejudices, by pretending to enter into her views, he gradually supplanted the influence of the lord-treasurer. He represented the languor of his measures. He gave insinuations concerning his secret in∣trigues with the Whigs. The artifice which he used with the Queen, he employed, with equal success, on the more violent Tories. In the beginning of the present year, he formed a serious design of placing himself at the head of a party, independent of the Earl of Oxford. But a well-grounded fear of the Whigs induced him after∣wards to adhere to the lord-treasurer. He was, however, at the bottom of all the mortifications which that mi∣nister suffered, by the desertion of some of the high-church party in the last session of parliament. To humble his rival was suitable to his violent passions. To ruin him entirely, considering the times and his own precari∣ous situation, was inconsistent with common prudence. His object was to strengthen himself, with the return of the Duke of Marlborough. That nobleman would have no objection to join with any party, who should contri∣bute to the fall of his enemy, the Earl of Oxford<NOTE N="G" PLACE="foot">MSS. passim. 1713</NOTE>. To feel the pulse of the Tories, and to sound the incli∣nations of the Queen, reports were industriously spread, in the summer, that the Duke was to return to Britain, at the express desire of the ministry<NOTE N="H" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1713.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His in∣trigues in favour of Marlbo∣rough.</NOTE> These insinuations produced not the expected effect. The Queen was averse from the measure. The Tories expressed no desire for the Duke's return. His Grace, having spent the summer in making vain solicitations to the house of Hannover for sending the Electoral Prince to Britain, seemed to be suddenly seized with an impa∣tience, not unnatural to his disposition, however much it was concealed. He represented to the Elector, that, being now in the sixty-sixth year of his age, he wished to pass the rest of his life in quietness, in his native coun∣try. That, as his Highness seemed so indifferent above the succession, it was time for his friends to take care of themselves. That, by coinciding with the views of the ministry, whose almost avowed intentions were to restore the Pretender, the friends of the house of Hannove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

might, perhaps, obtain security from a Prince, whose fa∣vour they could not, in reason expect. These chidings, bearing the appearance of zeal, were neither regarded nor feared. In the mean time, Bolingbroke proceeded in his intrigues. He daily gained the ground which the unhappy manner of the treasurer was destined to lose. He had often complained to the Queen of his principles. He now loudly accused him of dilatoriness and indolence. He affirmed, that, by neglecting the power which the influence of government had placed in his hands, he had permitted a greater number of Whigs, than was consistent with the safety of government, to obtain seats in the house of commons<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1713.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">who corre∣sponds with the Preten∣der.</NOTE> Expecting much from the intrigues of Bolingbroke, and tired of his own situation, the Duke of Marlborough again formed hopes of his speedy return. To regain his former power, he seemed inclined to desert his present friends. He was willing to govern Anne, by yielding to her prejudices. Under a certainty that she was attached to her brother's interest, he endeavoured secretly to gain the confidence of the Pretender's adherents abroad. He wrote to the Duchess of Berwick. He even sent a letter to the late King James's Queen. He dispatched one of his retainers to France. He empowered him to convey the most solemn protestations of his attachment to the Chevalier de St. George. He assured him, with an oath, that he would rather cut off his own right-hand, than oppose his views on the throne. That, provided he him∣self might be rendered secure, he would not hesitate a moment to use all his credit, both privately and publickly, for his service. He instructed the Duke of Berwick, he said, more largely on the subject; and he had reason to hope an answer suitable to his sincerity and zeal<NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">Ibid. Oct. 1713.</NOTE>. These relentings of Marlborough, if they were at all sin∣cere, were prevented from having any effect, by the fears of the Queen. The dangerous intrigues of the Duke, in the preceding year, had made such a deep impression on her mind, that she was even terrified at the very men∣tion of his name; and though she could not legally con∣tinue
<PB N="560" REF="583"/>
his exile, she resolved never to give her consent to his return<NOTE N="L" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1713.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Misrepre∣sentations of the Whigs.</NOTE> The terrors of the Queen for Marlborough proved a fatal blow to her own views. To ruin the treasurer, by supporting himself with the prejudices of the sovereign, the Duke might have probably deserted the principles of the Whigs; which, like many of the party, he had only adopted to favour his own designs. But when he found that the Queen was obdurate, and that the Pretender him∣self treated his proposals with caution and even distrust, he fell back with vehemence into his former professions to the house of Hannover. He corresponded with that family. Without either ceremony or distinction, he ac∣cused the ministry of incurable Jacobitism; and in the ge∣neral accusation even involved his friend Bolingbroke. He was joined in these assurances by most of the leaders of the Whig-party. The Duke of Argyle, yielding to personal resentment, affirmed to the envoy of Hannover, that he knew, from his own experience, the lord-trea∣surer was a false and deceitful man. That he exerted himself with all his might against the Protestant succession. That he was reforming the army, to facilitate the resto∣ration of the Pretender; and that even his friends acknow∣ledged, he was too far engaged to retreat. The Earl of Ilay extended his accusations much further than his bro∣ther, the Duke of Argyle. He assured the Hannoverian resident, that the Presbyterians were the only friends of the succession of the Electoral family; and that all the members of the church of England, especially in Scot∣land, were Jacobites, without exception<NOTE N="M" PLACE="foot">Hannover-papers. Dec. 1713.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They de∣mand mo∣ney for poor lords, &amp;c.</NOTE> The Whigs in general were impressed with uncommon fears. They again urged the Elector to invade the king∣dom. They promised to furnish him with sums, upon his credit, to save their country, and to execute his own designs; but, with an inconsistence repugnant to these large promises, they reverted to their former demands of money from his Highness. They asked pensions for poor, conscientious lords, who were in want of subsistence. They demanded, with the most vehement entreaties, two thousand pounds, to carry the elections for the com∣mon-council

A proposal, made by the Baron de Bernstorff, president of the Elector's council, was received by Marlborough and Cadogan with eagerness and joy. He insinuated, that his Electoral Highness might be in∣duced to borrow to the extent of twenty thousand pounds from his friends in Britain. This sum was to be laid out on the poor lords and the common-council of London, during the three years the parliament was to sit. The first would be thus enabled to vote according to their principles: the latter might ply the government, and ha∣rass the Queen and her ministers with remonstrances in favour of civil liberty and the Protestant succession. Marlborough and Cadogan undertook to furnish the mo∣ney, on the obligation of his Electoral Highness, provided the interest of five <HI>per cent.</HI> should be regularly paid<NOTE N="P" PLACE="foot">Ibid.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A general uneasiness and panic.</NOTE> During these secret intrigues of party, the nation was harassed with vague rumours and idle reports. The Queen, whose health had long declined, fell into a dan∣gerous illness, in the end of December. The minds of the two parties became strangely agitated, by various ex∣pectations or fears. The adherents of the Pretender fond∣ly imagined, that the period of his restoration was near. The Whigs, foreseeing their danger, lamented the fate of the kingdom in their own. The malicious and inte∣rested, on both sides, were busy in this state of public suspicion and suspense. A report was industriously spread, that a squadron of fourteen men of war were fitting out in the ports of France<NOTE N="R" PLACE="foot">Jan. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> 1714.</NOTE>; and that these ships were to take on board fourteen thousand troops. The public funds sell gradually in their price. On the twenty-ninth of Ja∣nuary, a sudden panic seized the minds of monied men. There was a great run on the Bank. The directors, in the utmost terror, applied to the lord-treasurer for his as∣sistance and advice. He endeavoured, in vain, to dispel their groundless fears. Nothing could remove their ap∣prehensions, till the Queen herself wrote a letter, on the first of February, to the lord-mayor, announcing her re∣covery. The public melancholy and panic were changed at once into festivity and joy. The armies, reported to be assembled in the Bolognese, and the squadrons said to be preparing in the ports of France, disappeared like an idle dream; and the Pretender, whom fame had placed at the head of a powerful invasion, was found to have re∣mained in his obscure retreat in Lorrain<NOTE N="S" PLACE="foot">Publications of the Times.</NOTE>.</P>

The Whigs and the Hannoverian agents put the worst construc∣tion on the advances made by the lord-treasurer. They were ignorant of his having lost a great part of his influ∣ence in the cabinet. They affected to consider his pro∣testations of zeal as so many baits to deceive. They wrote to Hannover, that the object of Harley's commis∣sion was twofold: That either the Queen appeared to the lord-treasurer to be in such a bad state of health, as to ren∣der it prudent to pay court to her legal successor; or that his own measures were not yet come to maturity in fa∣vour of the Pretender<NOTE N="W" PLACE="foot">Ibid.

Hanmer, who abetted in public the principles of the Tories, had privately made his peace with the Whigs. Under a promise, from the Hannoverian agents, of titles and preferments, when his Electoral Highness should mount the British throne, he had become suddenly a friend to the Protestant line<NOTE N="X" PLACE="foot">Hannover-papers, 1714.</NOTE>.

The whole party rested their hopes on this one article. They form∣ed no other plan of opposition. They had nothing fur∣ther to propose in parliament<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">Ibid.

That whatever their principles might have been in speculation, they would hazard nothing in practice. That, in the affair of the succession, they would embrace the cause of the first of the rivals for the throne that should arrive in the kingdom.

The court of Great Britain and the States-General had agreed to this preposterous proposal. The Spanish plenipotentiaries in∣sisted strenuously with the rest of the confederates to consent to a condition deemed essential by their master. They were, however, forced, at length, to abandon their demand. The Emperor would never consent to the dis∣memberment of any part of the Netherlands. The French King interfered with his grandson.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Queen opens the session of parliament.</NOTE> On the twenty-seventh of February a messenger arrived from Holland, with the ratifications exchanged of the treaty of commerce between Great Britain and Spain. The peace between the two kingdoms was formally pro∣claimed on the first of March. The Queen had return∣ed to London, in the middle of February, amidst the ac∣clamations of the populace, who were overjoyed at the prospect of her recovery from her late dangerous illness. But as her health was not sufficiently restored to open, with the usual ceremony of a speech, the business of parliament, the two houses had adjourned to the second of March. The Queen, having gone to the house of lords on that day, addressed her parliament in terms suit∣able to the state of the times. Having animadverted se∣verely on those who insinuated that the succession in the house of Hannover was in danger, she assured the two houses, that, to weaken her authority, and render her uneasy in the possession of the crown, could never be proper means to support the Protestant succession. She had done and should continue, she said, to do her best for

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They cen∣sure politi∣cal writers.</NOTE> The Whigs, having confined, by concert<NOTE N="H" PLACE="foot">Hannover-papers, Feb. 1714.</NOTE>, their operations to the projected demand of a writ for the Electoral Prince, no opposition was made, in either house, to warm addresses to the throne. The commons followed their address with a vote of supply. In consi∣dering an article of the Queen's speech, with regard to libels, the two parties flew into their usual flame. A mo∣tion was made in the house of commons against a pamph∣let, written with great acrimony and boldness, charging the servants of the Queen with mal-administration; and asserting, in express terms, that the Protestant succession was in danger, through their machinations. This per∣formance, though the work of a Mr. Moore<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot">MSS. passim.</NOTE>, was ascribed to Mr. Richard Steele, a name well known in the republic of letters. Steele, who had obtained a seat in the house of commons, acknowledged himself the author of this obnoxious publication. After various and long de∣bates, he was, upon a division, expelled the house<NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">March 18, 1714.</NOTE>. In the house of lords, the Whigs, foreseeing the severity against Steele, extended their animadversions to a publi∣cation, written in opposition to his pamphlet. This an∣swer, which reflected severely on the Scotish nation, had been ascribed, by public report, to the famous Dr. Swift. It was chiefly levelled against the Duke of Argyle, who was hated by the Doctor's patron, the Earl of Oxford. But though the violence of the Whigs yielded not to that of the Tories, they were not equal to them in point of numbers, when the matter came to a vote. The minis∣try, however, chose to remove the whole affair from be∣fore the lords into a court of common law.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The minis∣try dismiss several offi∣cers.</NOTE> During the contest between the parties in parliament, secret animosities subsisted in the cabinet. The two rivals for the Queen's favour were, however, united in their public measures against the Whigs, on account of their common fears. The ministry were no strangers to the designs of that party. They knew, that the Elector had
<PB N="568" REF="591"/>
been long solicited to undertake an invasion. They re∣solved, therefore, to be prepared against an event that threatened their own power, as well as the Queen's au∣thority. It was upon this account, and not in favour of the Pretender, that they fell upon the suspicious measure of new modelling the army. In the middle of March, the Duke of Argyle, the Earl of Stair, and other officers of rank, whom the ministry suspected, were removed from all their military employments. The Queen, how∣ever, paid an equivalent, in money, to the dismissed officers. The measure furnished the artful with an object of clamour, and terrified the credulous and timid. The Viscount Bolingbroke, who was known to have obtained the ascendant over the lord-treasurer, was accused of be∣ing the author of these dangerous counsels. His enemies affirmed, that, despairing of the Queen's life, and ex∣cluded from every hope of the favour of the house of Hannover, he precipitated every thing to pave the way for the restoration of the Pretender<NOTE N="L" PLACE="foot">Publications of the Times.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Elec∣tor refuses to gratify the Whigs.</NOTE> The leaders of the Whigs, terrified by this appearance of decision in the ministry, fell into their usual despon∣dence. They declared their opinion, that no hope re∣mained, but in the death of the Queen or in that of the Pretender. They blamed the court of Hannover for having sacrificed their friends, as well as their own hopes of the throne. The Elector argued in vain against the propriety of yielding to their desperate requests. He knew, he said, that the Queen was averse from seeing any of his family in her dominions. That, not withstand∣ing her prejudices, he would have sent the Electoral Prince to London, had he not been persuaded, that the measure would bring matters to an open rupture. That, as it was impracticable to bring the lawful successor into the kingdom, they ought to secure the succession, by re∣moving his competitor. That he had already made re∣peated instances to the Queen on that subject. That he was resolved to renew his remonstrances. That, as to their unceasing demands of money for poor lords, com∣mon-councils, bribery of members, and private pensions, he would hear no more of that affair. That, from the narrowness of his own income, he could not enter upon these heads, into any competition with his antagonist,
<PB N="569" REF="592"/>
the lord-treasurer. But that, except in the article of expences, he was willing to support to the utmost their party<NOTE N="M" PLACE="foot">Hannover-papers, March 20, N. S. 1714.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Unmanly fears of that party.</NOTE> These assurances on the part of the Elector neither answered the hopes, nor removed the fears of the Whigs. Though such Tories as were in the interest of the house of Hannover, though the lord-treasurer himself, though the concurring voice of the whole ministry declared, that the Protestant succession was in no danger, the lead∣ers of the party gave way to their own unmanly terrors. They drew inferences from uncertain facts. They im∣proved into strong realities idle rumours. They even believed, that preparations were already made for sending several of their leaders to the Tower. In this state of doubt and uneasiness, they resolved to make one other effort to gain the people, by awaking their fears. The lords having taken the state of the nation into considera∣tion, the Earls of Wharton, Nottingham, and Sunder∣land, with other peers of the same party, represented, in the strongest terms, the danger that threatened the Protestant succession. They moved, that an address should be presented to her Majesty, on the subject of the removal of the Pretender from Lorrain, and on other points, calculated to raise the resentment of the populace against the ministry. On this occasion the Earl of Ox∣ford made a motion, which seemed preposterous, as the motive was then unknown. He moved for leave to bring in a bill for the further security of the Protestant suc∣cession, by making it high-treason to bring any foreign troops into the kingdom<NOTE N="N" PLACE="foot">Han∣nover-papers, passim, 1714.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their con∣spiracy to seize the Tower, &amp;c.</NOTE> Men who ascribe to policy every measure of a minis∣ter, will find it difficult to account for the motion made by the lord-treasurer. If, as he averred, in the house, he only meant to preclude the adherents of the Pretender from invading the kingdom, his expedient was altogether nugatory and unnecessary. Such troops as should attend that Prince, would have been open enemies, if foreign∣ers, and rebels, if natives. The treasurer seems to have reasons for his present conduct, which he did not chuse to reveal. The States-General, alarmed by the terrors
<PB N="570" REF="593"/>
of the Whigs, and the zealous representations of the agents of Hannover, began to make preparations for aid∣ing effectually the Elector in his views on the British throne. Some ships of war were made ready for sea, in their ports. Some troops, especially the Scots in the service, had received orders to march toward the coast. The Whigs at home were ready to second the projected invasion from abroad. A set of inferior conspirators were prepared to support with action the deliberations of their leaders. Measures were concerted, by a society called the kit-cat club, to seize the Tower, to declare for the family of Hannover, to secure the persons of such as were suspected of favouring the Pretender. In this number the lord-treasurer himself had the misfortune of being comprehended by his enemies; and he awkwardly chose this preposterous motion, as a kind of proof of his being no stranger to the designs of the Whigs<NOTE N="O" PLACE="foot">Hannover-papers, passim, 1714, Publications of the Times. MSS. passim.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections.</NOTE> In all states that possess any portion of public freedom, the appeal of parties is always made to the people. Though the body of the nation enjoy but a very small share of any government, they make up with their weight and numbers, what they want in authority as individuals. The candidates for office endeavour to gain their favour, by applying to their principles, but oftner to their preju∣dices; and those succeed the best who impose with the most address and dexterity upon their credulity and fears. The good opinion of a people is therefore the citadel, if the expression may be used, to which factions direct all their irregular attacks; and when a party happens to possess themselves of that strong hold, they over a we their antagonists, and govern, at discretion, the noisy popu∣lace, by whose suffrages they have ascended to power. The domestic history of the present reign contains little more than a continued series of such political hostilities. In this clamorous contest, as well as in real war, the combatants acquire an experience, from length of time, that frequently suspends the fate of the conflict, when a decision is most to be apprehended.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Protestant succession voted out of danger.</NOTE> The Whigs, with a perseverance worthy of a better cause, than any design on power and office, had long con∣tinued
<PB N="571" REF="594"/>
their attacks on the Tories. The weight of go∣vernment, the efforts of the church, and the great popu∣larity of the Queen herself, had hitherto frustrated all their efforts. Disappointed in their public conduct, they had lately recourse to private measures, and succeeded in gaining over such Tories as were discontented with the ministry. The agents of the house of Hannover, at the suggestion of the leading Whigs, had prevailed with the Earl of Anglesea, and his followers in the house of lords, to desert the Tories, upon promises of future advan∣tage<NOTE N="P" PLACE="foot">Hannover-papers, 1714.</NOTE>. Sir William Dawes, though spontaneously raised by the Queen to the see of York, promised, upon the like assurances, to desert the measures of the court, and to carry over to the Whigs a majority of the bench of bishops<NOTE N="Q" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. Encouraged by this unexpected defec∣tion, the party introduced a warm debate, in the house of lords, on the fifth of April. After various speeches, the question was proposed, whether the Protestant succession was in danger? On a division, the court-party prevailed, by twelve votes<NOTE N="R" PLACE="foot">76 against 64.</NOTE>. The Earls of Abingdon and Jersey, the Lords Ashburnham, Herbert, and Carteret, who had uniformly supported the ministry, joined the Whigs, on the present occasion. The same question being agi∣tated before the commons, was carried, by a greater ma∣jority, for the adherents of the court<NOTE N="S" PLACE="foot">256 against 208.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cause of the deserti∣on of some Tories.</NOTE> Though the desertion of so many Tories from the mi∣nistry may be ascribed, in some degree, to the promises of the Hannoverian agents, they had motives of another kind. The most of those who joined the Whigs, had been highly irrigated against the Earl of Oxford. They knew that a party had long been forming against him in the cabinet, and that a defeat in parliament was only wanting to the completion of his ruin. He was abandon∣ed by his brethren in office. He was no longer supported by the Queen herself. The scanty majority, in a ques∣tion on which his power depended, was equal to a partial defeat. Every body expected to see him next day with∣out his staff as treasurer. He himself offered to resign<NOTE N="T" PLACE="foot">Hannover-pa∣pers, April 1714.</NOTE>. But he contrived to insinuate to the Queen, by one of
<PB N="572" REF="595"/>
his friends, that her ruin would succeed his fall. Struck with this application, her usual fears began to return. Though at the solicitation of the Lady Masham, she had consented to dismiss the treasurer, she became again reconciled to that minister, upon certain conditions<NOTE N="U" PLACE="foot">Hannover-papers, April 1714.</NOTE>. The Earl of Nottingham, who hoped to succeed Ox∣ford in the treasury, was again disappointed<NOTE N="X" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>; and thus was forced, by his resentment, to abet a party of whose principles he secretly disapproved.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Motions of the Whigs against the Pretender</NOTE> The Whigs, encouraged by the late accession to their party, carried farther their opposition against the crown. On the subject of the Chevalier de St. George only, they could raise the fears of the people. They moved, therefore, for an address to her Majesty, for renewing her instances with the Duke of Lorrain, to expel the Pre∣tender from his dominions. An addition made to their motion, seemed levelled against the suspected feelings of the Queen's mind. It was proposed to request her Ma∣jesty to issue a proclamation, setting a price on her bro∣ther's head. The Lord North and Grey, seconded by the Lord Trevor, opposed, with vehemence, this latter measure<NOTE N="Y" PLACE="foot">April 8. 1714.</NOTE>. They represented, that the motion was as inconsistent with common humanity, as it was repugnant to the Christian religion. That, to set a price on any man's head, was to encourage assassination, by public au∣thority. That, for their own parts, should ever the case come before them, as peers and judges, they would think themselves bound, in justice, honour, and conscience, to condemn such an action as murder. The Whigs argued upon the ground of expediency. But the Tory lords who had joined them, some days before, deserted them on this occasion. The bishops, either from principle or decency, were averse from this sanguinary measure; and, upon a division, the addition to the first motion was rejected<NOTE N="Z" PLACE="foot">Journals, April 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their fears superfluous and vain.</NOTE> The address to the Queen was presented only by a few Whig lords. Could a judgment be formed of the state of things, from the conduct of parliament, one might suppose, that the nation was then in imminent danger. That the Pretender was ready to make a descent upon Britain, with a powerful army; or that he was invited
<PB N="573" REF="596"/>
by a formidable party at home. That his friends only waited for his arrival, to dethrone the Queen, and utterly extirpate all the Whigs in the kingdom. The contrary of all this was the truth. The French, who could only support the Pretender, were unwilling to plunge into those disasters from which they had been lately extricated by a species of miracle. Lewis the Fourteenth, never hearty in the cause of the excluded Stuarts, was now more averse than ever from giving them any effectual support. His ambition and his love of glory had vanished with his power. He felt the decline of years. Though still ea∣ger to live, he foresaw his own approaching death. The prospect of French affairs was gloomy, beyond that pe∣riod. He was to leave the scepter in the hands of a sickly infant, under the tuition of an unprincipled relation, who, from the very misfortunes of the late war, had perhaps extended his views to the crown. In this melancholy state at home, Lewis thought of nothing less than to kindle a war abroad, by assisting the Pretender.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Observati∣ons on their conduct.</NOTE> Were then the fears of the Whigs an idle dream? Or aimed they only at the persecution of an unfortunate wo∣man, already driven to the verge of the grave by solici∣tude as well as disease? To save the honour of that party, the answer to these questions must be made at the expence of their understanding. Having first endeavoured to alarm the populace with the fears of Popery and the Pre∣tender, they began at length to be the dupes of their own arts; and to believe seriously what they had so often aver∣red. Their precipitate schemes had created the only dangers that now threatened the object of the act of set∣tlement. Had the Queen been less timid, or the minister more violent, or even more regardless of his original prin∣ciples, the first to preserve her authority, and the latter to secure his power, and, perhaps, ultimately his life, might have entered into measures that would have proved fatal to the succession in the house of Hannover. The conduct of the Whigs was, throughout, more calculated to irritate than to intimidate, had the ministry carried into their councils that contradictory boldness and obstinacy, which bad treatment invariably raises in the minds of the spirited and proud.</P>
<P><PB N="574" REF="597"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their scheme to embarrass the Queen.</NOTE> Though the Whigs, in a fit of despondence, had threatened to the court of Hannover to abandon their principles and to shift for themselves, their success in the late questions had animated them to further attempts against the Queen and her servants. They had proposed to the Hannoverian resident, in the beginning of the ses∣sion, to demand a writ for the Electoral Prince to sit in the house of peers, as Duke of Cambridge. The resident, without any direct orders from his court, communicated his design to the lord-treasurer, who had uniformly made the most violent, yet the least effectual, professions of his zeal for the Protestant line. That minister plainly told him, that to bring over any of the family of Lunen∣burgh, would be to place her coffin before her Majesty's eyes; and that those who had any respect for her friend∣ship, or hopes from her favour, should never propose a thing so utterly disagreeable to her mind<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Hannover-Papers, 26 Feb. / 9 March, 1714.</NOTE>. The Elec∣tor himself was as much averse from the measure as the Queen. He had uniformly refused his consent to the sending over the Electoral Prince, in the preceding year; and his refusal was so peremptory, that the Whigs, and even his servants, made no scruple of ascribing his con∣duct to a jealousy of his own son<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 1713. passim.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A writ de∣manded for the Elector∣al Prince.</NOTE> Though the Elector had not probably changed his sen∣timents, he yielded, in part, to the earnest instances of the Whigs. He permitted Schutz, his envoy at London, to demand, in the name of the Electress, a writ for the Electoral Prince, as Duke of Cambridge. Schutz, whose eagerness had frequently extended his measures beyond the limits of his instructions, took the first opportunity for executing his commission. On the twelfth of April, he waited upon the Lord-Chancellor Harcourt, and de∣manded the writ, in form. Startled at this unexpected request, the chancellor declined to give any answer till he should consult the Queen. He hastened to the palace. A cabinet-council was immediately called. The Queen exhibited upon the occasion, every symptom of violence and passion. She commanded the chancellor to write in∣stantly to Schutz. She ordered him to signify, that, as
<PB N="575" REF="598"/>
she had heard nothing of the matter from the court of Hannover, she could not persuade herself that their mi∣nister acted in the present case by their instructions<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">Hannover-papers, April 24, N. S. 1714.</NOTE>. This was the only answer the resident could obtain to his demand. The exultations of the Whigs increased the resentment of the Queen. She declared, in the most pe∣remptory manner, that she would rather suffer the last extremities, than permit any Prince of the Electoral fa∣mily to come to Britain to reside during her life. That she considered the conduct of the resident in the light of a personal affront. As a mark of her ultimate displeasure, she sent the master of the ceremonies to forbid Schutz to appear any more at her court. She ordered that officer to declare, at the same time, to the envoy, that she in∣tended to solicit the Elector and Electress for his instant recall<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">Ibid. May 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The lord-treasurer's professions.</NOTE> The lord-treasurer, terrified at an incident that was likely to create an open rupture between the Queen and the presumptive heirs of the crown, began to make fresh professions of zeal to the latter. He assured them, that he was entirely and unalterably devoted to the interest of the house of Hannover. That this proceeded not only from the conscience of his oaths, but out of a profound respect for their many virtues. That he might without vanity say, he had the chief hand in settling their succes∣sion to the crown. That the Lady Masham was for the Protestant line. That he was sure the Queen was in∣clined to the same side. That nothing therefore could endanger the succession, but the sending over any of the Electoral family without her Majesty's consent<NOTE N="E" PLACE="foot">Ibid. April 25.</NOTE>. He, however, altered his language in a few days. He de∣clared, that he never thought matters would have been pushed so far. That he was apprehensive of his own speedy disgrace. That he was desired to enter into the views of the Pretender; and that the Queen was more determined than ever to strengthen the interest of her brother, and to secure for him the throne<NOTE N="F" PLACE="foot">Ibid. May 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>If Anne was before attached to the eventual succession of the Pretender, the present incident was calculated to hasten her designs. She was alarmed, on the subject of
<PB N="576" REF="599"/>
the writ, to a degree that gave an unusual animation and even vehemence to her conduct. She wrote to the Prin∣cess Sophia. She sent letters to the Elector and the Elec∣toral Prince. She expressed to each her surprise at the design of sending the Prince to England. She, almost openly, threatened, that his coming to Britain might endanger, if not prevent, the succession of his family to the throne. In this determined conduct, that timid Prin∣cess seems to have been chiefly supported by her own fears. She found, that the attachment of her subjects to her person declined with the state of her health. That, though she had many servants, she was totally destitute of friends. That those whom she trusted the most were the least likely to adhere to her cause. That a minister, who derived his claim to her favour from his pretending to support her measures, was making terms for himself with her political enemies. That her authority, and even her very title, as sovereign, would depend upon the moderation of her successor; and that she would be either forced to resign her crown, or to exert its prero∣gatives, in subserviency to a party whom she both hated and feared<NOTE N="G" PLACE="foot">MSS. passim.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Elec∣tor's de∣mands.</NOTE> During the convulsions in Britain, the lord-treasurer's cousin arrived at the court of Hannover. The Whigs, and especially the Duke of Marlborough, had, by letters, raised prejudices in the mind of the Elector, with regard to the real object of Harley's embassy. His Highness received him with manifest coldness. He paid little at∣tention to his prosessions. He, however, ordered a me∣morial to be given to Harley, couched in the most decent terms. He informed the Queen, that he was sensible of her former favours; but that something still remained to be done. He represented to her Majesty, that it was necessary to oblige the Pretender to retire to Italy. That his remaining in Lorrain was dangerous, as his Highness was well assured, that he meditated a descent in North-Britain. That, for the security of her royal person, her kingdoms, and the Protestant religion, it seemed necessa∣ry to settle in Britain some Prince of the Electoral family, who might be attentive to such important concerns. That he took the liberty to renew his instances for a pension and establishment for the Electress, as the nearest heir

to the crown; and that he hoped her Majesty would grant the titles belonging to the Princes of the blood to such sons of the house of Hannover as were not already raised to dignities<NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">Hannover-papers, May 7, 1714.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Intrigues of Oxford.</NOTE> Though the lord-treasurer had the misfortune to pro∣cure no credit to his professions, he continued to make advances to the court of Hannover. To retain the con∣fidence of the Queen, he was forced to declare publickly against the coming of the Electoral Prince. But he, at the same time, insinuated to the Hannoverian agents, that he would not be sorry to see the Prince arrived in Britain. He took, however, advantage of the present terrors of the Queen, to recover the influence he had lost. He assured her, that it was the violence of Boling∣broke that induced the Elector to demand the writ<NOTE N="L" PLACE="foot">Ibid. May 8.</NOTE>. He pretended to have gained, with promises of advantage, the Lady Masham. His emissaries privately accused Bolingbroke and Harcourt of a fixed design for establish∣ing the Pretender on the thron<NOTE N="M" PLACE="foot">Ibid. May 18.</NOTE>. He even boasted to his friends, that he would soon compel both his antago∣nists to resign. But, notwithstanding these pretences, he found that his credit with the Queen was greatly upon the decline. He, therefore, entered into secret negocia∣tions with the Whigs. He expressed his fears for the succession. He represented their own apparent danger. They accepted his offers, promised to forget the past, and to maintain for the future his authority<NOTE N="N" PLACE="foot">Ibid, May 26.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in parliament.</NOTE> During this suspicious, rather than busy session of par∣liament, the two houses passed two bills of considerable importance<NOTE N="O" PLACE="foot">Journals.</NOTE>. The first limited to a certain number the officers, civil and military, that should be capable of becoming members of the house of commons. The se∣cond was calculated to prevent the growth of schism, in a manner deemed extremely severe, by the Dissenters. This last bill furnished an ample field of contest for the two contending factions. It was said to have been intro∣duced by Bolingbroke to harass Oxford, who favoured the Dissenters; and to gain to himself the support and affection of the high-church party. In matters of religion, men are frequently as inconsistent with them∣selves,
<PB N="578" REF="601"/>
as in politics. The leaders of the ministry, who supported the bill with all their own eloquence, as well as with the weight of government, were themselves bred Dissenters. The Earl of Nottingham, deemed inviola∣bly attached to the church of England, forgot his religi∣ous principles in his political resentment. Though he had made the bill against occasional conformity the price of his joining the Whigs, he opposed with vehemence the present bill<NOTE N="P" PLACE="foot">Publications of the Times.</NOTE>. The lord-treasurer himself retired, without voting upon the question. This conduct was, at the time, ascribed to his religious principles. But it is now known, that it proceeded from his secret coalition with the Whigs<NOTE N="Q" PLACE="foot">Hannover-papers, May 1714.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Situation and views of the Pre∣tender.</NOTE> While the courts of Great Britain and Hannover, the two houses of parliament, and the whole British nation, were distracted with hopes and fears about the succession, the Pretender lived, in a state of anxious obscurity, in Lorrain. Foreigners, judging from the fears of the friends of the house of Hannover, formed no doubt of his speedy restoration to the throne. They concluded, that his sister was heartily in his interest: That her ser∣vants were forming effectual schemes for securing his suc∣cession to the crown. The Duke of Lorrain, gained by the softness of his manners, touched with his misfortunes, or forming hopes upon his future prospects, entered hear∣tily into his cause. Perceiving the indifference of France, he endeavoured to gain the Imperial court to the interest of his guest. He even directed his envoy at the court of Vienna to ask for him in marriage one of the daughters of the Emperor Joseph. Charles the Sixth was so little offended at this request, that the only objection he made was the disparity in their age. The arch-dutchess was but twelve years old; but the Pretender was in his six and twentieth year. The Emperor recommended his own sister, as a more suitable match. He, however, prudently observed, that the times were too critical to come to a determination on this head. But that, when an occasion should offer, he was much disposed to give to the Chevalier de St. George solid marks of his esteem and regard<NOTE N="R" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, Feb. 22, 1714.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="597" REF="602"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A procla∣mation against him, offering a reward.</NOTE> Many zealots in Britain maintained, in the mean time, a correspondence with the Pretender and his servants. The ministry continued to admit his agents into their con∣versation, to serve or ruin his cause, as might best suit with their own interest. But, amidst insinuations of at∣tachment, and, perhaps, professions of zeal, they were betrayed into a measure, which might convince him, that his hopes from their favour were ill founded. An infor∣mation having been obtained, by the vigilance of the Earl of Wharton, against some Irish officers, who in∣listed men for the Pretender, they were seized by a war∣rant from the Queen's Bench. The people were alarm∣ed. The Whigs added artfully to their fears. The ad∣herents of the ministry were terrified. The lord-trea∣surer now, in concert with the Whigs, had wrought so much upon the natural timidity of the Duke of Shrews∣bury, that he joined him in an important measure upon the present occasion<NOTE N="S" PLACE="foot">MSS. 1714.</NOTE>. The discovery made by Whar∣ton having fallen under the deliberation of the cabinet-council, it was carried by a majority of votes, that a proclamation should be issued against the Pretender. Shrewsberry deserted his principles of Jacobitism, and his political friend Bolingbroke, upon this point<NOTE N="T" PLACE="foot">Hannover-papers, 25th June / 6th July <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/></NOTE>. A proclamation was accordingly issued, on the twenty-third of June, promising a reward of five thousand pounds for apprehending the Pretender, whenever he should land or attempt to land in Great Britain. The two houses voted an address of thanks to the Queen; and the commons, in their zeal for the Protestant succession, extended the reward to one hundred thousand pounds<NOTE N="U" PLACE="foot">Journals, June 24, 1714.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen endeavours to soothe the Elector.</NOTE> The conduct of the Queen, upon the present occasion, seemed inconsistent with her suspected attachment to the interest of the Pretender. But her fears from the family of Lunenburgh had suspended her affection for her own. Her object was to soothe the Elector, to agree to her re∣quest of keeping the Prince at home. She had taken early precautions for this purpose. Soon after the writ was demanded, she appointed Lord Paget her ambassador to the court of Hannover. But his Lordship having de∣clined
<PB N="580" REF="603"/>
that service, she conferred that character on her own cousin, the Earl of Clarendon. The Elector, on his part, ordered the Baron de Bothmar to repair to Lon∣don, to supply the place of Schutz, who, upon being forbid the court, had left the kingdom. Bothmar endea∣voured to defeat the object of Clarendon's embassy, by raising prejudices against that nobleman in the mind of the Elector. He informed his court, that Clarendon was a selfish and presumptuous fool<NOTE N="X" PLACE="foot">Hannover-papers, June 16, 1714.</NOTE>. That, when he was governor of an American province, he dressed himself as a woman, the better to represent the Queen's person. That this foel, to use Bothmar's words, was appointed without the treasurer's knowledge. That Bolingbroke had acquired the superiority; and that Oxford had made, through Kreyenberg the resident, the most servile ad∣vances to Bothmar himself: <Q REND="inline">"A sure sign,"</Q> says he, <Q REND="inline">"of his approaching fall<NOTE N="Y" PLACE="foot">Ib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of the Princess Sophia.</NOTE> During these transactions, the Electress Sophia died suddenly at Hannover, in the eighty-fourth year of her age<NOTE N="Z" PLACE="foot">May 28, O. S.</NOTE>. She retained her faculties to the last. But there is reason to believe, that, had she even survived Queen Anne, she would not mount the throne. She was a Princess possessed of great prudence, good sense, lively parts, and a considerable degree of knowledge, with an affability of disposition that rendered her much beloved. Though she was the only person mentioned by name in the act of settlement, her great age had pre∣vented her from being the principal object of attention. The Elector, without consulting her, seems to have in∣structed his envoys in her name; and the parties in Bri∣tain, who strove to pay their court to the family of Lu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>enburgh, had, for several years, much neglected the Princess. Her demise, as it was not unexpected, was regarded as a common occurrence. Scarce any mention is made of that event in the papers of the Hannoveriat agents in Britain, except where it is announced in form to the Queen. Her death, therefore, could produce no change on the present state of affairs.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">State of the ministry.</NOTE> But though the Elector was now one step nearer the throne, his efforts to secure the succession were far from

keeping pace with the sanguine hopes of his friends. He made no preparations for sending the Electoral Prince to Britain. To gratify the Whigs, to put an end to the teasing entreaties of his servants, and, perhaps, even to terrify Queen Anne, he had given permission for demand∣ing the writ. But there is no reason to believe, that he altered his first sentiments on that subject, or that he ever seriously designed to permit his son to depart from his dominions. This conduct would have thrown back the Whigs into their former despondence, had not their hopes of power been, from time to time, revived by the dis∣sensions in the cabinet. The common safety of the two candidates for the Queen's favour had hitherto preserved a kind of union in their public counsels. The measures of the crown, though languidly supported, were carried forward with a degree of unanimity. The jealousy of the Tories, except in a few questions, on which some of their leaders joined the Whigs, from motives of private interest or resentment, had cemented them together, in a manner not to be disjoined by the squabbles between Oxford and Bolingbroke. But as the quarrels of these men were likely soon to accomplish the fall of the one or the other, the Whigs looked forward to the confusion ex∣pected from that event. They watched with eagerness the cabals of the two rivals; and hoped, through the dissensions of their political enemies, to resume the reigns that had been struck from their own hands.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Parliament prorogued.</NOTE> The supplies being granted, and the public business, in some measure, finished, the Queen came in person to the house of lords, on the ninth of July. In her speech from the throne, she made no mention either of the house of Hannover, or of the Protestant succession. Her fears from the coming of the Electoral Prince were dissipated. But her resentment was not yet abated. She told the two houses, that her chief concern was to pre∣serve the liberty and the religion of her subjects, and to secure the present and future tranquillity of the kingdom. That, to attain these desirable ends, her parliament ought to shew the same regard for the just prerogatives of the crown, and for the honour of government, as she had always expressed for the rights of her people<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Journals, July 9, 1714.</NOTE>. Hav∣ing finished this speech, she ordered the chancellor to
<PB N="582" REF="605"/>
prorogue the parliament to the tenth of August. Men, who ascribed to some design all the measures of Anne, put various constructions on a prorogation which was not so suddenly expected. Those, who argued with most decisiveness on this subject, attributed the measure to the manifest decline in the health of the Queen. They af∣firmed, that a dropsy, under which she laboured, in∣creased from day to day: That the ministry had their reasons for wishing that parliament might not be sitting at her death. Besides, that their projected schemes now demanded all their time and their care<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">Hannover papers, July 1714.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Open rup∣ture among the minis∣try.</NOTE> In reasoning in this manner, mankind must have sup∣posed that the ministry were united, by the same princi∣ples and the same views. Nothing, however, could be more contrary to truth, than this supposition. The chief servants of the crown were divided between two irrecon∣cilable rivals; men obstinately resolved on each other's destruction. During the sitting of parliament, the ani∣mosities between Oxford and Bolingbroke were, in some degree, restrained by their common fears. Their mutual friends established, from time to time, a temporary recon∣ciliation between those rivals for power. But, when the parliament was prorogued, they observed neither modera∣tion nor common decency in their contests. The first could bear no equal in the Queen's favour. The latter was re∣solved to yield no longer to a superior. They descended into altercation, personal reflection, and mutual accusa∣tion. The lord-treasurer made no scruple to declare, that he could produce evidence that Bolingbroke was a determined Jacobite. Bolingbroke, on his part, openly affirmed, he had proofs in his hands, that Oxford was in the interest of the Pretender. Though the allegations of neither seem to have been well founded, they had both the misfortune to be believed<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 1714.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Immediate cause of their quar∣rel.</NOTE> Though the difference in their characters, and a per∣petual struggle for power, had rendered the treasurer and secretary irreconcilable enemies, a late incident in parlia∣ment was the obvious cause of their present fury. A few days<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">July 2.</NOTE> before the prorogation, the lords took under con∣sideration
<PB N="583" REF="606"/>
the trade to Spain and the West-Indies, as late∣ly settled by the treaty concluded at Madrid. This ex∣amination was suggested by the lord-treasurer, now secret∣ly in the interest of the Whigs, to procure the fall of Bo∣lingbroke. The Queen had reserved for herself the fourth part of the assiento or contract for negroes. This share was privately divided into sixteen parts. Five were designed for the lord-treasurer, five for Bolingbroke, four for Lady Masham, and two for one Arthur Moore, the agent of the junto in this affair<NOTE N="E" PLACE="foot">Hannover-papers, July 24, 1714.</NOTE>. The Earl of Ox∣ford, perceiving the dangerous state of the Queen's health, sacrificed an uncertain interest for certain revenge. In the course of the examination, he made himself a party against his associates in spoil. He joined those lords who insisted to hear the Spanish merchants against the trea∣ty<NOTE N="F" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. He encouraged an address to the Queen, re∣questing her Majesty to apply to the use of the public her part of the profits of the assiento contract. Bolingbroke dictated an answer, that gave great offence to the lords. Neither he nor the Lady Masham could forgive the trea∣surer for a measure, which in hurting their interest, had deeply wounded their pride.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Concert be∣tween</NOTE> This incident hastened the fall of the treasurer. But it was far from being the sole cause of his disgrace. Though Bolingbroke had failed in his project of bringing Marlborough into office, in the preceding winter, he ne∣ver lost sight of that object. During the whole session, he is said to have held a correspondence with the Duke, whose only objection to the present men and measures was an irreconcilable aversion to the Earl of Oxford. That minister, by his suggesting no difficulties in any measure, was a servant calculated to please a weak sovereign, that was always haunted by political fears. He had, there∣fore, obtained a dominion over the Queen, which neither the arts of Bolingbroke nor the influence of Lady Masham could remove. The demand of the writ, made by the envoy of the house of Hannover, was one of these few incidents that had raised any appearance of spirit in the mind of Anne. Bolingbroke had the address to persuade her, that this measure was privately promoted by the Earl of Oxford. His cabals with the Whigs, his vehe∣ment
<PB N="584" REF="607"/>professions to the Electoral family, his mysterious conduct, which she had now, for the first time, remark∣ed, confirmed the insinuations of Bolingbroke. She, there∣fore, resolved to dismiss a servant, whom she could no longer consider in the light of a friend<NOTE N="G" PLACE="foot">MSS. passim.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bolingbroke and Marl∣borough.</NOTE> Bolingbroke, on the other hand, humoured the Queen in all her prejudices. He suggested to her, that to pay any attention for the future to the house of Hannover was incompatible with her service<NOTE N="H" PLACE="foot">Hannover-papers, July 20, 1714.</NOTE>. Her resentment had placed her in the scale of the Pretender, as far as she was permitted by her own timidity and jealousy. The principal object of Bolingbroke was to perpetuate his influence; that of Marlborough to regain his former power. The first knew that he could not support him∣self alone, after the removal of the lord-treasurer. The latter had no objection to his entering into any measures, should that minister be removed from the cabinet. The views of both were turned to their own interest. Should the Queen live and continue her favour for the Pretender, they would probably have paved his way to the throne. Should she happen to die, before matters were ripe, the Duke had established an interest with the family of Han∣nover, that might preserve his friend. Though no de∣cisive proofs of their intrigues can be NOW produced, a probable conjecture may be made. They designed, per∣haps, to serve the Pretender, by the means of Sweden. The ambassador of that kingdom made no secret of his expecting REAL assistance, through the means of Boling∣broke, from the British court; and he openly expressed his wishes, that the Pretender were already arrived<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot">Ibid. July 31, 1714.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their views.</NOTE> THE Duke of Marlborough, assured of the projected disgrace of Oxford, hastened to Ostend, to embark. But he was detained there for a fortnight by contrary winds. In this interval of suspence, the difficulty which Boling∣broke found in forming the shew of a ministry, was the cause of the delay in the treasurer's fall. His own ob∣ject was to continue secretary of state to command all the foreign correspondence. He was, however, to dis∣miss Bromley, his colleague in office, and to place the seals in the hands of Sir William Wyndham. The trea∣sury
<PB N="585" REF="608"/>
was to have been put into commission. The Earl of Anglesea was to have been at the head of the board<NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">Hannover papers, July 20.</NOTE>. But either some of these men declined the offices allotted for them, by Bolingbroke, or he himself became undecisive, through the weight of his own power. He, however, re∣solved to remove the Earl of Oxford, and to trust the rest to fortune. On the twenty-seventh of July, when the treasurer came to court, he was deprived of his staff. He was, however, permitted to fall gently from his high station, being suffered to retain all his other offices<NOTE N="L" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 1714.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dismission and charac∣ter</NOTE> The character of the Earl of Oxford has been describ∣ed in all its singularities as the incidents arose. But the throwing into one view its most striking features, may give a more complete portrait of the man. The talents bestowed upon him by nature were neither extensive nor obvious; and these seem to have been little improved by education, though he has been called a patron of learn∣ing and of learned men. His whole progress in literature was confined to that slight knowledge of the dead lan∣guages, which men intended for public life generally bring from school. He neither understood foreign lan∣guages, nor wrote, with any degree of elegance, his na∣tive tongue. In the disposition of his mind he was re∣served, distrustful and cold. A lover of secrecy to such a degree, that he assumed its appearance in mere trifles; fond of importance, without any dignity of manner; so full of professions, that he was always deemed insincere. In his public measures he was rather tenacious of his pur∣pose, than either firm or resolute in his conduct: yet much more decisive in the means of annoying his ene∣mies, than in those calculated to gratify his friends. With a facility of temper that could deny no request, but with a defect of mind that could bestow nothing with grace, he offended the disappointed, and even lost those whom he served. The disposal of offices, which gives influence to other ministers, was a real misfortune to the Earl of Oxford. He often promised the same place to five per∣sons at once; and created sour enemies, without making the fifth his friend.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">of the Earl of Oxford</NOTE> But if the Earl of Oxford was not remarkable for striking virtues, he had the good fortune to be free from glaring vices. Though undecisive in the great line of

business, he was not subject to personal fear. Though thoroughly ambitious, he was a stranger to haughtiness and pride. Though persevering in his opposition to his enemies, he was not in his temper revengeful; and though he made no scruple to tempt the honesty of others, with money, he himself cannot be accused, with justice, of the least tincture of avarice. In his public measures he can never deserve the character of a great minister. There was a narrowness of sentiment, a vulgarity of po∣licy, and even a meanness in his conduct, that frequent∣ly excited the contempt of his best friends. In his pri∣vate intrigues for power, in his dextrous management of two parties, by whom he was equally hated, in his tem∣pering the fury of the Jacobites, in his amusing the ve∣hemence of the Whigs, in his advancing the interests of the house of Hannover, when most distrusted by them∣selves and their adherents, he shewed a considerable de∣gree of address and political knowledge. The nation owed to a defect in Oxford's mind, a greater benefit, than they could have derived from a minister of more splendid talents. Had he been possessed of the pride in∣separable from great parts, his resentment for the ill usage, which he experienced from the Whigs and the agents of the house of Hannover, might have induced him to de∣feat the Protestant succession, and bring about those very evils of which he was unjustly accused.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Observati∣ons.</NOTE> In a country where freedom prevails, extensive talents are far from being the nearest path to the possession of power. Their prior condition must place mankind in the line of preterment; otherwise their abilities, instead of being employed by the state, become, through want of use, a burden to themselves. The most intelligent so∣vereign, at the head of a popular government, is ex∣tremely circumscribed in the choice of his servants. He must rule his people through the medium of persons whom some accident, independent of themselves, have fixed in a certain rank in the community. But, as the advan∣tages which savour ambition, are enemies to the toil ne∣cessary for improving and enlarging the mind, men fre∣quently come to the management of the concerns of a great kingdom, with abilities scarce sufficient to regulate the affairs of a private family. Hence, and not from a dearth of ta∣lents, proceed the confined systems, the vulgar policy,
<PB N="587" REF="612"/>
the uniform undecisiveness of public councils. A minis∣ter, instead of moving the whole machine of govern∣ment, suffers himself to be carried forward by its inhe∣rent motion; and should no accidents happen, the praise must be given to fortune. These observations may be applied, with a degree of justice, to the Earl of Oxford; who carried into his public conduct, all the narrowness of his private character.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Consusion in the cabi∣net.</NOTE> Though the Viscount Bolingbroke had the address to remove the lord-treasurer, he was not able to seize the reins which he had struck from his hands. Wild, visio∣nary, and vehement, in all his projects, he had not fore∣seen difficulties, or he was found incapable to surmount them, when they came. During three days of anarchy and confusion in the cabinet, the minds of men were agi∣tated with the vicissitudes of hopes and fear. The Queen herself, in a dangerous state of health before, had in∣creased the violence of her distemper, by the agitation of her spirits. Having assisted at a council of her principal servants, in the night of the twenty-ninth of July, she became perplexed, beyond measure, at their differences in opinion, and want of decision. The usual discharge, from an imposthumation in her leg, was stopped. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 1. Death of the Queen.</NOTE> The gouty matter, translating itself to the brain, threw her into a dozing insensibility, in which she expired, at Ken∣sington, on Sunday the first of August, about seven of the clock in the morning. In a transient interval of her lethargy, she delivered the treasurer's staff to the Duke of Shrewsbury, who had been recommended to that high office by such of the privy council as were assembled, up∣on the occasion, at Kensington.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Her person and charac∣ter.</NOTE> Thus died Anne Stuart, Queen of Great Britain and Ireland, in the fiftieth year of her age and thirteenth of her reign. In the person she was of a middle stature, and before she bore children well-made. Her hair was dark, her complexion sanguine, her features strong, but not ir∣regular, her whole countenance more dignified than a∣greeable. In the accomplishments of the mind, as a wo∣man, she was not deficient. She understood music: She loved painting: She had even some tasse for works of ge∣nius. She was always generous, sometimes liberal, but never profuse. Like the rest of her family, she was good-natured,
<PB N="588" REF="613"/>
to a degree of weakness. Indolent in her dis∣position, timid by nature, devoted to the company of her favourites, easily led. She possessed all the virtues of her father, except political courage. She was subject to all his weaknesses, except enthusiasm in religion. She was jea∣lous of her authority, and sullenly irreconcilable toward those who treated either herself or her prerogative with disrespect. But, like him also, she was much better qualified to discharge the duties of a private life, than to act the part of a sovereign. As a friend, a mother, a wife, she deserved every praise. Her conduct, as a daugh∣ter, could scarcely be excused by a virtue much superior to all these. Upon the whole, though her reign was crowded with great events, she cannot, with any justice, be called a great Princess. Subject to terror, beyond the constitutional timidity of her sex, she was altogether inca∣pable of decisive councils; and nothing, but her irresis∣tible popularity could have supported her authority, amidst the ferment of those distracted times.</P>
