<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT may appear singular, that, because I can flatter myself with being numbered among your friends, I should, for that very reason, dedicate this Opera to you, <HI>without asking your permission:</HI> but it is my know∣ledge of your diffidence, that has prevented that solicitation.</P>
<P>As I should, however, fear to forfeit my claim to your friendship, by giving you, in public, that praise which you shun
<PB N="iv" REF="4"/>
in private, I must content myself with the hope, that you will consider this as an attempt to prove the esteem and regard with which</P>

<P>IT is so usual for the Author of a Drama∣tic Piece, on its Publication, to thank the Performers; that, on some Occasions, a Writer might be led to withhold his Acknow∣ledgments, left Truth should be considered as mere customary Compliment.</P>
<P>The Author of the following Opera is not, however, subjected to that Risque, when he acquits himself of a Duty, by giving the Per∣formers a Tribute of Praise, the Justice of which is attested by the Voice of the Public.</P>

<SPEAKER>CORO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, my old friend Stanmore; I ex∣pected to have seen you in England before now.—Well, Sir, what news in Bengal?—How is your old friend and patron, Colonel Bentley; as whimsical as ever?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>As well beloved in the settlement as ever, I promise you: the Colonel's singulari∣ties do not cloud his virtues;—while others court esteem, he commands it.—You know he has long fought under the banner of plain dealing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>"CORO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, that's a service in which there is but bad pay.—He won't be able to enlist many recruits."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>"STAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then the honour!"</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CORO.</SPEAKER>
<P>"Why, as you say, if he loves the honour of fighting, he will have enough—for with plain dealing, he will be sure to find enemies in plenty every where."—And how is the charming young lady, whom the Colonel has taken under his patronage?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ormellina, you mean.—She is a charming creature indeed—but still unmarried.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CORO.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose she won't remain so long;
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
the Colonel has, no doubt, taught her to be obedient, in order to train her up for a wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>A wife! No, no, sir, the Colonel is too much a man of honour, to think of uniting threescore and eighteen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CORO.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what has honour to do in the busi∣ness, my dear Stanmore?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not much, indeed.—I think an un∣fortunate young woman has far less reason to complain of the poor fellow who takes her purse on the highway, than of the old dotard who robs her of her happiness, under the title of mar∣riage; and yet the same laws which encourage her to hang the one, command her to honour and obey the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CORO.</SPEAKER>
<P>You seem to speak feelingly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have but too much cause;—the woman I loved was thus sacrificed.</P>
</SP>

<P>Here comes a passenger of mine, a taylor, with whom I must bring you acquainted; I think the fellow will entertain you.</P>
<STAGE>Enter TWIST.</STAGE>
<P>Mr. Stanmore, this is Tom Twist,—a very whimlical fellow, who, not being satisfied with sitting cross-legged in London, is resolved to cut out work for himself in Bengal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am his most obedient.—And pray, Mr. Twist, what business do you mean to fol∣low in Bengal?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>"TWIST.</SPEAKER>
<P>The same business which every one else follows in Bengal; getting money, oh, Captain."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>"STAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>But in what line?—For there are various ways of carrying on that business.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>"TWIST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, and some of them d—d strange ways, they tell us in England.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>"STAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, Mr. Twist, on what do you mean to depend, in becoming a favourite of fortune?"</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TWIST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Accomplishments, Sir.—I can dance a cotillion tolerably; sing twenty songs, about Jockies and Jennies, for the ladies; and play Malbrouk on the fiddle.—In short I can do every thing but write and read, and my genius never could stoop to that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER>CORO.</SPEAKER>
<P>But tell me, how did you acquire these elegant accomplishments?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TWIST.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know, Sir, I always moved in a genteel circle.—My master worked for none but people of quality: not a tradesman in Westminster could boast of a greater number of book debts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>That must have been a vast happi∣ness!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TWIST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; old Staytape ruined himself by his great connections—He visited some of the first people.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CORO.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! a taylor visit the first people?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TWIST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, Sir,—two or three times a day sometimes; but he was seldom fortunate enough to meet with them at home; they weretoo much engaged in paying off the debts of the nation, to attend to their own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CORO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Twist, a truce with your wit for the present. I have promised my friend Mush∣room to send you to him.—He wishes to have some clothes made up in a hurry; and if your needle goes but as fast as your tongue, I shall gain credit by recommending you.</P>
</SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>ORM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Once more, my dear little adventurer, welcome to Bengal. Captain Coromandel's letter introduces you to me with the highest en∣comiums; but he omits to tell me what has oc∣casioned you to quit England in this disguise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ELIZA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, my dear Ormellina, what be∣ing is that in the creation, for whom woman feels a thousand various emotions, who is her blessing and her torment, her tyrant and her slave, the man she loves?—In short, I am come to Bengal in search of a husband, no uncom∣mon errand, I believe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ORM.</SPEAKER>
<P>But your story.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ELIZ.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is told in a few words. The prayers and intreaties of an indigent mother forced me to marry where I could not love. The object of my affections quitted the kingdom in de∣spair, and took passage for Bengal.—My auld Robin Grey is lately dead. I disguised myself thus, and embarked for India, in the hope of discovering my lover, and sharing with him that fortune, which I have so dearly acquired.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ORM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Generous girl!—And so this lover is my friend—Ensign Stanmore. But tell me, what is this history of me, which you say you have heard?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>ELIZ.</SPEAKER>
<P>That you are an orphan—educated by Colonel Bentley as his daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ORM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ELIZ.</SPEAKER>
<P>That your lover's name is Warnford—that you are jealous of him with a woman of intrigue—a Mrs. Mushroom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>"ORM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who could have told you this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>"ELIZ.</SPEAKER>
<P>All that relates to you and Mr. Warnford, I learned from Mrs. Mushroom herself: I called at her house just now, with a letter of introduction from Captain Coro∣mandel.—You seem surprised at my know∣ledge; but I should think very meanly of myself, indeed, were I to be in any place two hours, without learning the scandal of the whole neighbourhood."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ORM.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you have no reason to suppose that Warnford requites her attachment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ELIZ.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I am not sure of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ORM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh that I were ascertained of the contrary.</P>

<L>Hear me, O god of love,</L>

<P>You shall not long remain in suspence—I am now going again to Mrs. Mushroom, and will contrive to gain information; but I vow I had forgot to tell you my name.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="14"/>
<SPEAKER>ORM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your name!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ELIZ.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must know that, in order to conceal myself from my lover the more effec∣tually, I have assumed this disguise, and am at present Alexander M'Proteus, at your service.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ORM.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why disguise yourself from my poor friend Stanmore?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ELIZ.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only till I have perplexed him a little.—Coquetry with a lover, is like playing with your lap-dog, "or kitten." The fonder you are of the pretty animal, the more delight you feel in teazing it. Come, come, my dear friend, I shall make you a convert to my laugh∣ing philosophy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ORM.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish indeed you could.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ELIZ.</SPEAKER>
<P>Depend upon it, I shall. None can pay more sincere homage to Cupid, than we laughing lovers. You sighing folks make him an eastern despot, and fall prostrate before him; with us, he is an European prince—we bow and simper at his levee: you degrade him to the mere tyrant of slaves; we exalt him to a glorious situation—the monarch of happy sub∣jects.</P>

<P>Well, Sir, and is it not that pre∣cious wife who has introduced you to most of the company you keep in Bengal?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MUSH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my dear, you have indeed in∣troduced me to all the rake-helly young dogs in the three provinces; they stick so close to you, that, whenever you go out, you move like the queen bee, with a whole swarm after you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. MUSH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, Sir, very well; but indeed what had I else to expect, when I mar∣ried an illiterate, sordid wretch, and twenty years older than myself into the bargain?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MUSH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, that's an unpardonable crime in me. I never knew a woman leave age out of the list of a man's faults. What an ass was I to marry a broken milliner from Bond-street, who brought out a face as badly patched up as
<PB N="10" REF="16"/>
her reputation, for a venture to Bengal; be∣sides which, she hadn't stock in trade enough to fill one of her own band-boxes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. MUSH.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very fit match, Mr. Mush∣room, for an ignorant run-away shop-boy, with a mind as destitute of ideas as his pockets were of money.—The whole settlement knows your origin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MUSH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I always meant they should know it. I glory in it, that there was a time when Martin Mushroom, one of the richest men in Bengal, had not half-a-crown in his pocket, nor a whole coat to his back.—Zounds!—</P>

<P>I cry for quarter, my dear Madam; a slip of the tongue has betrayed me, to be sure. The truth is, love induced me to assume this disguise, which I must wear for two or three days.

<SPEAKER>ELIZ.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly—Why, what can you do? If a smart fellow will attack you with a <HI>curse me, madam, but you are a monstrous fine wo∣man,</HI> you would not be so ill bred as to blush, look foolish, and threaten to tell your husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. MUSH.</SPEAKER>
<P>That would be ill breeding, indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>To be sure. Lud, why a declara∣tion of love excites a woman to coquetry, as naturally as the sound of a fiddle excites her to dance. Never mind, my dear Madam; scan∣dal is a tax on pleasure; and if the commodity cannot be smuggled, a woman of spirit will rather pay the duty than go without it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. MUSH.</SPEAKER>
<P>But is it not very hard that scan∣dal should attack us women of spirit, who, in∣stead of shrinking from Temptation, boldly meet him, put him to the rout, and shew the rest of our sex the way to victory and glory? My maxim, Mr. M'Proteus, is, that virtue should be tried.</P>

<SPEAKER>STAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so, Sir, you will still continue the imposition, of letting her suppose she is an orphan, supported and educated by your bounty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BENT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly. It is that happy ignorance of her birth, which has saved her from the ill effects of my fondness; for, I am sure, if I had once owned her for my daughter, I should cer∣tainly have spoilt her. You know, Stanmore, I am one of those fools, who are vulgarly called good-natured people, and who find themselves involved in a thousand difficulties, merely be∣cause they can't say <HI>no</HI> to any thing.</P>

<P>Whenever a man wanted to borrow a few guineas, which he never meant to repay, Jack Bentley was the man applied to; and I had the exclusive privilege of being pigeon'd by my friends, merely because I was the best creature in the world. However, I soon found it was a damn'd misfortune to be so agreeable; so I e'en parted with my character, to save my money, and affronted my acquaintance, to prevent my being obliged to quit society.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STANM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, there it is, now—What a pity, that good-nature, like the dress of an officer in battle, should be only a dangerous mark of dis∣tinction, for the enemy to aim at.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BENT.</SPEAKER>
<P>How often have I envied poor Sam Sulky! He was a happy fellow—blest with the worst temper I ever knew, and had the finest forbidding frown—never lent a man a shilling in his life—nobody praised him, and he praised no∣body—so he grew rich, because people did not like his company well enough to ruin him.</P>

<P>Ah, Colonel! you would not have changed places with him, for all that—Your natural disposition—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>BENT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, you do me a great deal of honour, to fancy my face a gazette extraordinary of good news to you. But, I say again, that you are mis∣taken; I am not benevolent—I am ill-temper'd, Sir, and morose; and, as for all the silly cant of lovers, I consider it as the half-form'd dialect of children, an abuse of language, which they cor∣rect as they grow older.</P>

<P>It is the language of my heart, Sir; and while that heart beats, such must be its effusions.</P>

<SPEAKER>WARNF.</SPEAKER>
<P>Meanly concealed! No man, but yourself, Colonel Bentley, dare use the expression. If I have had recourse to artifice, it was in an honourable cause; in defence of beauty and vir∣tue, which claimed my protection against the

man who dares to become my accuser.—I own a lady is there.</P>
