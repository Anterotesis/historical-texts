<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>A Poem<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">STREPHON and CHLOE.</NOTE> of Dr. SWIFT'S, (with all due Defe∣rence to the Ladies, that Poem is menti∣oned) gave the Author the first Idea of a Comedy on this Subject. He had not thought sufficiently of it, to form any regular Plan, when <HI>La Nouvelle Ecole de Femmes,</HI> of Monsieur <HI>De Moissy,</HI> fell into his Hands. There were Circumstances and Senti∣ments in that Piece, which coincided with his De∣sign; and he also had some Objections. The Hus∣band's visiting a Lady of Fashion, under his own Name, and passing upon her for an unmarried Man; the <HI>Chevalier</HI>'s Attempt upon his Friend's Honour, without a proper Detection of either of them; the Wife singing and dancing about the Stage thro' the whole Last Act, in order to reclaim her Husband, and his Approbation of it; without any other <HI>Denouement,</HI> and without any Situations of Embarassment, which the Story so naturally tended to, were, in his Opinion, palpable Deficien∣cies. To substitute other Materials, to form a Last Act entirely new, and to work the whole into an <HI>English</HI> Comedy, was the Employment of some vacant Hours in the last Summer. Whether he has been able to do it with any tolerable Spirit, either in the Dialogue, Characters, or Fable, he now submits to the Decision of the candid Rea∣der. He acknowledges the public Candour, and he returns his Thanks to Mr. <HI>Garrick,</HI> for his ad∣mirable Acting; and to all the Performers con∣cerned in the following Scenes; and also in THE DESERT ISLAND.</P>

<P>But, Sir, your stating of the Case—</P>

<P>Dear Ma'am, don't interrupt.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Love.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Let me explain this Matter.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Brill.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Mrs. <HI>Lovemore,</HI> allow me fair Play.—I am now upon my Defence.— You will please to consider, Gentlemen of the Jury, that Mr. <HI>Lovemore</HI> is not a Ward,
<PB N="14" REF="18"/>nor I a Guardian; that he is his own Master to do as he pleases; that Mr. <HI>Lovemore</HI> is fond of Gaiety, Pleasure, and Enjoyment; that he knows how to live, and if he does not like the Bill of Fare that is catered for him at home, he very naturally goes abroad to seek for something more palatable.</P>
<P>How say ye?—Gentlemen of the Jury?— Not guilty.— There, Ma'am, you see, Not guilty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Love.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You run on finely, Sir <HI>Bril∣liant;</HI> —but don't imagine that this bantering Way —</P>

<P>Acquitted by my Country, Ma'am, you see, — fairly acquitted! —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Love.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Be it so then.—But you hinted something about Mr. <HI>Lovemore</HI>'s not liking his Bill of Fare at home, — I should be glad you would explain that Matter, Sir—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir. <HI>Brill.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Right, Madam, very right: — I did touch upon that Head. — It was but slightly— I did not care, in an open Court, to enlarge further upon that Mattter.— But to be plain, upon my Word, Mrs. <HI>Lovemore,</HI> for a fine Woman like you to be the Dupe of your own false Delicacy, an old fashioned Kind of Sentiment, a vulgar Prejudice, pro∣scribed by Custom long ago; an antiquated Principle of I know not what:— Renounce it altogether—<HI>vivez</HI> Ma'am,— do like other People of Condition; mix with other amia∣ble Ladies, who know how to use the Senses
<PB N="15" REF="19"/>Nature has given them; pluck the Fruit that grows around ye, and bid adieu to the Reign of the melancholy Pleasures for ever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Love.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>After the very edifying Counsel you give Mr. <HI>Lovemore,</HI> this loose Strain of yours, Sir <HI>Brilliant,</HI> is not at all surprizing;— and, Sir, your late Project:—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Brill.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>My late Project! —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs.<HI>Love.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir: Not content with leading Mr. <HI>Lovemore</HI> into a thousand Dissi∣pations from all conjugal Affection and do∣mestic Happiness, you have lately introduced him to your Mrs. <HI>Bellmour.</HI>—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Brill.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ma'am, he does not so much as know Mrs. <HI>Bellmour.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs.<HI>Love.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Fye upon it, Sir <HI>Brilliant!</HI> — Falsehood is but a poor—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Brill.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Falsehood I disdain, Ma'am,— and I Sir <HI>Brilliant Fashion</HI> declare, that Mr. <HI>Lovemore,</HI> your Husband, is not acquainted with the Widow <HI>Bellmour;</HI>— and if he was acquainted? —What then? — No ill Conse∣quence could from thence redound to you.— You don't know that Lady, Ma'am. — But I'll let you into her whole History, — her whole History, Ma'am:— Pray be seated. The Widow <HI>Bellmour's</HI> History, is this;— She is one of those Ladies—</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Love.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg your Pardon, Mrs. <HI>Lovemore;</HI> Indisposition of the Mind. — Sir <HI>Brilliant,</HI> that is really a mighty pretty Ring you have on your Finger.—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Brill.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A Bauble: Will you look at it?</P>

<P>It would be News to me, Sir, if you would be kind enough to let me know whether I may expect the Favour of your Company to Dinner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Love.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would be impertinent in me to answer such a Question, because I can give no direct positive Answer to it; — as Things happen, — perhaps I may, — perhaps may not. — But don't let me be of any Inconve∣nience to you; — it is not material where a body eats. — Can I set you down any where, Sir <HI>Brilliant?</HI></P>

<P>Pshaw!— Prithee now,—How can you, my Dear? — That's very peevish now, and ill-natured.—It is but about a mere Trifle.— Hark ye, <STAGE>(whispers,)</STAGE> I lost every Thing I play'd for after you went, — the <HI>Fo∣reigner,</HI> and he, understand one another. —
<PB N="18" REF="22"/>I beg Pardon, Ma'am, it was only about an Affair at the Opera.</P>
</SP>

<P>The Opera, Mr. <HI>Lovemore,</HI> or any thing, is more agreeable than my Company.</P>

<P>It would be gothic to the last Degree.— Ha! ha!</P>

<P>Ha! ha! — To be sure, for me to be of the Party, would look as if we lived together like our Friend Sir <HI>Jealous Hotbrain</HI> and his scolding Wife, who are for ever like two Game-Cocks, ready armed to goad and wound one another most heartily.—Ha! ha!</P>

<P>He's gone to visit this Mrs. <HI>Bellmour,</HI> I suppose. —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Brill.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Ma'am, how can you take such a Notion in your Head? — But apro∣pos — that brings us back to the little Hi∣story I was just going to give you of the Wi∣dow <HI>Bellmour.</HI>—</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Proceed, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="20" REF="24"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Brill.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The Widow <HI>Bellmour,</HI> Ma'am, is a Lady, who to all the Charms of external Beauty, has added such an Elegance of Un∣derstanding, and such a Vivacity of Wit, that it is no Wonder all the pretty Fellows are on their Knees to her. — Her Person youthful, blooming, and graceful; — and then her Manner! — And so entertaining! — Such Quickness in her Transition from one thing to another; and every thing she does, does so become her! — Does she sit still? 'tis an indolent <HI>Venus</HI> before ye, — Does she move? 'tis Beauty walking in conscious Triumph! To see her smile, and hear her talk,—I shall glow up into Rapture, and fall a raving if I talk a Moment longer about her.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Love.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, finish your Picture, Sir.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Brill</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis from the real Life, I assure ye.—In short, Ma'am, she is a Lady that has been abroad, has ever kept the best Compa∣ny, and has such a Variety of Talents, that Upon my Soul, she knows the whole Theory of agreeable Sensations better than all the Phi∣losophers in <HI>Europe.</HI>—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Love.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And to this Theory, she has joined the Practice, I presume.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Brill.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>She has. —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Love.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I imagined as much.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Brill.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ma'am!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Love.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You need not affect to be sur∣prized, Sir, — there is no mighty Secret in the Affair. — My Accounts of the Lady in∣form
<PB N="21" REF="25"/>me, that she is as you say, young and handsome; has lived a great deal Abroad, buried her Husband there, is lately come to Town, has taken a House, — lives at great Expence, receives all the Men of Rank and Fortune. — We all know what the World is apt to infer from these Appearances.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Brill.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I am no Stranger to the Way of the World. — Every Object has its different Aspects, its Side-lights; and the World is generally good-natured enough to fix upon the most unfavourable Points of View.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Love.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>So then, this is another anti∣quated Prejudice of mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Brill.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing more certain.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Love.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! mighty well, Sir! —She is a very Vestal; — come, exhibit your Por∣trait. —A Vestal from your School of Paint∣ing will, no doubt, be very curious.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Brill.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Madam, consider what you are saying! — What is your Charge against this Lady? That she is amiable! — Surely Mrs. <HI>Lovemore</HI> should be the last Per∣son in the World, to reproach her with a Qua∣lity, which so eminently possesses herself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Love.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The Gallantry of that Com∣pliment, Sir <HI>Brilliant,</HI> added to your other Favours —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir. <HI>Brill.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What next? — That she has agreeable Talents! — What then? As Na∣ture is liberal of Talents to but very few, she makes a kind of Recompence to those
<PB N="22" REF="26"/>who have none, by conducing to their En∣tertainment.—But she is young and hand∣some!—So perishable a Quality might, me∣thinks, be suffered to bloom without Re∣proach.—Ay, but she has taken a House, and sees Company.—It is what she is intitled to, and a fine Picture should be seen by Peo∣ple of Rank and Taste;— and surely, Ma∣dam, your Sex entrenches upon your own Happiness, by not allowing that a Woman may partake of the innocent Pleasures of Life, unless she has resigned her Person to a Man, and parted with her Liberty!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Love.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And so you would persuade me that Mr. <HI>Lovemore</HI> is not acquainted with her?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Brill.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Absolutely ignorant of him!— and I'll tell you further, she has such a Ge∣nerosity of Temper, and such a feeling Heart, that were she to know him, and to know that his Visits gave you Pain, she would ne∣ver be at home for him again.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Love.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Then give me leave, Sir — If you have so exalted an Opinion of the Lady, how comes it that you desist from paying your Addresses in that Quarter?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Brill.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Compulsion, Ma'am,—it is not voluntary. — The Garrison, I thought, was upon the Point of surrendering, but up came my Lord <HI>Etheridge</HI> with his honourable Forces to relieve the Town.—I thought he was out of the Kingdom, but it seems he
<PB N="23" REF="27"/>is returned. — I bribed the Chambermaid yesterday, and I find he has supplanted me; and so all that remains for me, is to do justice to the Lady, and console myself in the best way I can for my Demerits; and the Insufficiency of my Pretensions.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Love.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And am I really to believe all this?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Brill.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>May the first Woman I put the Question to, strike me to the Center with a supercilious Eyebrow, if every Syllable is not minutely true,—so that you see, Ma'am, I am not the Cause of your Inquietude. — There is not on Earth a Man that could be more averse from such a thing,—nor a Per∣son in the World, who more earnestly as∣pires to prove the tender Esteem he bears ye,—and, Ma'am,—I have long panted for an Opportunity.—By all that's soft she hears me. <STAGE>(aside.)</STAGE> — I have long panted, Ma'am, for a tender Moment like this,—with all the Ardor of Love, which Charms like yours alone could kindle.— <STAGE>(She rises disconcerted)</STAGE> Were it even at the Expence of my Life— <STAGE>(She walks about uneasy.)</STAGE>—You see, my dear Ma'am, we both have Cause of Discontent; we are both disappointed,—both crossed in Love,—and so, Ma'am, the least we can do is, both heartily to join to sweeten each other's Cares.</P>

<P>Tho' I have not the Pleasure of your Acquaintance, Ma'am, there is a par∣ticular Circumstance which has determin'd me to take this Liberty with you; for which I intreat your Pardon beforehand.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Love.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I shall appear perhaps very ri∣diculous, and indeed I am afraid I have done the most absurd Thing.—But Ma'am, from the Character you bear for Tenderness of Disposition, and Generosity of Sentiment, I easily incline to flatter myself, that you will not take Offence at any thing; and that if it is in your Power, you will afford me your Assistance.</P>

<P>'Tis mighty odd, this. <STAGE>(aside)</STAGE> Madam I must own my Curiosity is a good deal excited; — <STAGE>(take's her by the Hand.)</STAGE> — Pray Ma'am, give me leave — I beg you will
<PB N="35" REF="39"/>sit down,—pray don't think me impertinent—may I beg to know who the Gentleman is?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Love.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You have such an Air of Frankness and Generosity, that I will open myself to you: I have been married to him these two Years; I admired him for his Un∣derstanding, his Sentiment, and Spirit; I thought myself as sincerely loved by him, as my fond Heart could wish, but there is of late, such a strange Revolution in his Tem∣per, I know not what to make of it: — In∣stead of the Looks of Affection, and Expres∣sions of Tenderness with which he used to meet me, 'tis nothing now but cold, averted, superficial Civility. — While abroad, he runs on in a wild Career of Pleasure; and to my deep Affliction, has fix'd his Affections upon another Object.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Bell.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>If you mean to consult with me in regard to this Case, I am afraid you have made a wrong Choice; there is something in her Appearance that affects me, <STAGE>(aside.)</STAGE>—Pray excuse me, Ma'am, you consider this Matter too deeply. — Men will prove false, and if there is nothing in your Complaint but mere Gallantry on his side, — upon my word, I can't think your Case the worse for that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Love.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Not the worse!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Bell.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>On the contrary, much better. If his Affections, instead of being alienated, had been extinguish'd, he would have sunk into a downright stupid, habitual Insensibi∣lity;
<PB N="36" REF="40"/>from which it might prove impossible to recall him.—In all Love's Bill of Morta∣lity there is not a more fatal Disorder,—but your Husband is not fallen into that Way.—By your Account, he still has Sentiment, and where there is Sentiment, there is still Room to hope for an Alteration. — But in the other Case, you have the Pain of seeing yourself neglected, and for what? — for nothing at all; — the Man has lost all Sense of Feeling, and is become to the warm Beams of Wit and Beauty, as impenetrable as an Ice-house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Lov.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I am afraid, Ma'am, he is too much the Reverse of this, too susceptible of Impressions from every beautiful Object.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Bell.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, so much the better, as I told you already;—some new Idea has struck his Fancy, and he will be for a while, under the Influence of that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Love.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How light she makes of it!</P>
<STAGE>(aside.)</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Bell.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But it is the Wife's Business to bait the Hook for her Husband with Vari∣ety; and to draw him daily to herself:—That is the whole Affair, I would not make myself uneasy, Ma'am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Love.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Not uneasy! when his Indif∣ference does not diminish my Regard for him! Not uneasy, when the Man I doat on, no Longer fixes his Happiness at home!</P>

<PB N="37" REF="41"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Bell.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ma'am, you'll give me leave to speak my Mind freely.—I have often: ob∣serv'd, when the Fiend Jealousy is rous'd, that Women lay out a wonderful deal of Anxiety and Vexation to no Account, when perhaps, if the Truth were known, they, shou'd be angry with themselves instead of their Husbands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Love.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Angry with myself, Madam! —Calumny can lay nothing to my Charge, —the Virtue of my Conduct, Madam—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Bell.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Look ye there now,—I wou'd have laid my Life, you wou'd be at that,— that's the Folly of us all. — But Virtue is out of the Question at present.—I mean the want of Address, and proper Management! It is there that most Women fail,—Virtue alone cannot please the Taste of this Age.— It is <HI>La Belle Nature,</HI>—Nature embellish'd by the Advantages of Art, that the Men expect now-a-days.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Love.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But after being married s;o long, and behaving all that time with such an Equality —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Bell.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, that Equality is the Rock so many split upon.—The Men are now so immers'd in Luxury, that they must have eternal Variety in their Happiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Love.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>She justifies him.</P>
<STAGE>Aside.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Bell.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you what; I wou'd venture to lay a Pot of Coffee, that the Per∣son who now rivals you in your Husband's
<PB N="38" REF="42"/>Affection, does it without your good Quali∣ties, and even without your Beauty, by the mere Force of agreeable Talents, and Assi∣duity to please.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Love.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I am afraid that Compli∣ment —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Bell.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Let me ask you, Ma'am, have you ever seen this formidable Person?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Love.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I think I have.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Bell.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What fort of a Woman, Pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Love.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Formidable indeed!—She was describ'd to me as one of charming, and rare Accomplishments: And that is fatally too true!—I can see in her the sensible, the spirited, the — in short, in her I see my Ruin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Bell.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Never throw up the Cards for all that. — Really, Ma'am, without Compli∣ment, you seem to have all the Qualities that can dispute your Husband's Heart with any Body; but the Exertion of those Qualities, I am afraid, is suppress'd.—You'll excuse my Freedom.—You shou'd counterwork your Rival, by the very same Arts she employs.— I know a Lady now in your very Situation, — And what does she do? She consumes herself with eternal Jealousy; whereas, if she wou'd but employ half the Pains she uses in teazing herself, to vie vith the Creature that has won her Husband from her, —to vie with her, I say, in the Arts of pleasing, — for it is there a Woman's Pride shou'd be piqued,
<PB N="39" REF="43"/>— wou'd she do that, take my word for it, Victory wou'd declare in her Favour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Love.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Do you think so, Ma'am?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Bell.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Think so!—I am sure of it,— for there is this Advantage on her Side, that Virtue is an Auxiliary in her Cause,—and Virtue is the best beautifying Fluid for the Complexion; it gives a Lustre to the Fea∣tures, that cannot be equall'd by any Arti∣fice whatever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Love.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What can this mean? I begin to doubt.</P>
<STAGE>aside.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Bell.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But even Virtue herself must condescend to call in external Aid.—Her own native Charms wou'd do, if Men were perfect, but that is not the Case and since Vice can assume Allurements, why should not Truth and Innocence have additional Ornaments also?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Love.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I begin to think Sir <HI>Brilliant</HI> has told me truth.</P>
<STAGE>aside.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Bell.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I have been married, Ma'am, and am a little in the Secret.—It is much more difficult to keep a Heart than win one—After the fatal Words for better for worse, the general way with Wives is to relax into Indo∣lence, and while they are guilty of no Infide∣lity, they think that is enough:—But they are mistaken, there is a great deal wanting— an Address, a Manner, a Desire of pleasing — an agreeable Contrast in their Conduct, of grave,
<PB N="40" REF="44"/>and gay;—a favourite Poet of mine,—<HI>Prior,</HI> has expressed this very delicately.</P>
<L>Above the fix'd and settled Rules</L>
<L>Of Vice, and Virtue, in the Schools,</L>
<L>The better Part should set before 'em</L>

<P>But when the natural Tem∣per —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Bell.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The natural Temper must be forc'd, Home must be made a Place of Plea∣sure to the Husband, and the Wife must throw infinite Variety into her Manner;— in short, she must, as it were, multiply herself, and appear to him fundry different Women on different Occasions.—And this, I take to be the whole Mystery; the Way to keep a Man.—But I run on at a strange Rate.— Well, to be sure, I'm the giddiest Creature. — Ma'am, will you now give me leave to enquire, how I came to have this Favour?

<P>Ay, and Beauty too; for upon these Occasions, "the Passions in the Features are—" I have seen many a beautiful Countenance change in a Moment, into absolute Defor∣mity; the little Loves and Graces that before sparkled in the Eye, bloom'd in the Cheek, and smil'd about the Mouth, all fly off in an Instant, and resign the Features which they before adorn'd, to Fear, to Anger, to Grief; and the whole Train of fretful Passions.</P>

<P>Very true, Ma'am; and if by chance, they do bridle and hold in a little, the Struggle they undergo is the most ridiculous Sight
<PB N="46" REF="50"/>imaginable. —I have seen an Oath quivering upon the pale Lip of a reigning Toast, for Half an Hour together; yes, and I have seen an uplifted Eye blaspheming Providence for the Loss of an odd Trick;—and then at last, when the whole Room burst out into one loud universal Uproar,—"My Lord, you flung away the Game.—No, Ma'am, it was you.—Sir <HI>George,</HI> why did not you rough the Diamond? Capt. <HI>Hazard,</HI> why did not you lead through the Honour? Ma'am, it was not the Play.— Pardon me, Sir, —But Ma'am,—But Sir,— I would not play with you for Straws.—Don't you know what <HI>Hoyle</HI> says? If A and B are Partners against C and D, and the Game Nine-all, A and B have won three Tricks, and C and D four Tricks; C leads his Suit, D puts up the King then returns the Suit, A passes, C puts up the Queen, B roughs the next:" and so A and B, and C and D are bang'd about; and all is Jargon, Confusion, Uproar, and Wrangling, and Nonsense, and Noise. —Ha! ha!</P>
