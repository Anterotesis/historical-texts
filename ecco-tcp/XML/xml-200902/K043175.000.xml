<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOHN, Earl of BUTE, GROOM of the STOLE TO HIS Royal Highness the Prince of WALES.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE generous concern you were pleased to express for the anxieties of a young Author, then wholly unknown to your Lordship, and trembling for his first attempt towards <Q>the gravest, moralest, and most
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
profitable of all poems,</Q> as Milton calls a Tragedy, was the distinguishing mark of a mind truly great, and endued with those fine feelings which are the ornaments of even greatness itself. To this your innate partiality for every endeavour in the polite arts I must ascribe it, that the following scenes met with an early approbation from your Lordship; an approbation that was at once the author's pride, and his strongest assurance of success.</P>
<P>The Public have indeed very far outgone my most sanguine hopes, in their reception of this piece: but now, my Lord, <HI>The Orphan</HI> has another severe trial to go through; he must ad∣venture into the world, unassisted by the advan∣tages of representation: he must enter your Lordship's closet, and there stand the examina∣tion of the most accurate criticism. <HI>In Meti des∣cendat judicis aures.</HI> This cannot but be an alarming circumstance to a writer fully consci∣ous of his own inability; who has not been able entirely to please even his own taste; who de∣spairs of satisfying others of a more exalted
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
relish in the arts, and therefore craves at your Lordship's hands that protection to his industry, which he is aware cannot be granted to his merit.</P>
<P>I have the honour to remain, with the truest respect, and most grateful acknowlegement,</P>

<LG>
<L><HI>ENOUGH of Greece and Rome. Th' exhausted store</HI></L>
<L><HI>Of either nation now can charm no more:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Ev'n adventitious helps in vain we try,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Our triumphs languish in the public eye;</HI></L>
<L><HI>And grave processions, musically slow,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Here pass unheeded,—as a Lord Mayor's shew.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>On eagle wings the poet of to-night</HI></L>
<L><HI>Soars for fresh virtues to the source of light,</HI></L>
<L><HI>To China's eastern realms: and boldly bears</HI></L>
<L><HI>Confucius' morals to Britannia's ears.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Accept th' imported boon; as ecchoing Greece</HI></L>
<L><HI>Receiv'd from wand'ring chiefs her golden fleece;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Nor only richer by the spoils become,</HI></L>
<L><HI>But praise th' advent'rous youth, who brings them home.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>One dubious character, we own, he draws,</HI></L>
<L><HI>A patriot zealous in a monarch's cause!</HI></L>
<L><HI>Nice is the task the varying hand to guide,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And teach the blending colours to divide;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Where, rainbow-like, th' encroaching tints invade</HI></L>
<L><HI>Each other's bounds, and mingle light with shade.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>If then, assiduous to obtain his end,</HI></L>
<L><HI>You find too far the subject's zeal extend;</HI></L>
<L><HI>If undistinguish'd loyalty prevails</HI></L>
<L><HI>Where nature shrinks, and strong affection fails,</HI></L>
<L><HI>On China's tenets charge the fond mistake,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And spare his error for his Virtue's sake.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>From nobler motives our allegiance springs,</HI></L>
<L><HI>For Britain knows no Right Divine in Kings;</HI></L>
<L><HI>From freedom's choice that boasted right arose,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And thro' each' line from freedom's choice it flows.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Justice, with Mercy join'd, the throne maintains;</HI></L>
<L><HI>And in his People's</HI> HEARTS OUR MONARCH <HI>reigns.</HI></L>

<LG>
<L><HI>THRO' five long acts I've wore my sighing face,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Confin'd by critic laws to time and place;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Yet that once done, I ramble as I please,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Cry</HI> London Hoy! <HI>and whisk o'er land and seas—</HI></L>
<L><HI>—Ladies, excuse my dress—'tis true Chinese.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Thus, quit of husband, death, and tragic strain,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Let us enjoy our dear small talk again.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>How cou'd this hard successful hope to prove?</HI></L>
<L><HI>So many heroes,—and not one in love!</HI></L>
<L><HI>No suitor here to talk of flames that thrill;</HI></L>
<L><HI>To say the civil thing—"Your eyes so kill!"—</HI></L>
<L><HI>No ravisher, to force us—to our will!</HI></L>
<L><HI>You've seen their eastern virtues, patriot passions,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And now for something of their taste and fashions.</HI></L>
<L><HI>O Lord! that's charming—cries my Lady Fidget,</HI></L>
<L><HI>I long to know it—Do the creatures visit?</HI></L>
<L><HI>Dear Mrs. Yates, do, tell us—Well, how is it?</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>First, as to beauty—Set your hearts at rest—</HI></L>
<L><HI>They're all broad foreheads, and pigs eyes at best.</HI></L>
<L><HI>And then they lead such strange, such formal lives!—</HI></L>
<L><HI>—A little more at home than English wives:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Lest the poor things shou'd roam, and prove untrue,</HI></L>
<L><HI>They all are crippled in the tiney shoe.</HI></L>
<L><HI>A hopeful scheme to keep a wife from madding!</HI></L>
<L><HI>—We pinch our feet, and yet are ever gadding.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Then they've no cards, no routs, ne'er take their fling,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And pin-money is an unheard-of thing!</HI></L>
<L><HI>Then how d'ye think they write?—You'll ne'er divine—</HI></L>
<L><HI>From top to bottom down in one strait line.</HI></L>
</LG>
<STAGE>Mimicks.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L><HI>We ladies, when our flames we cannot smother,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Write letters—from one corner to another.</HI></L>
</LG>
<STAGE>Mimicks.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L><HI>One mode there is, in which both climes agree;</HI></L>
<L><HI>I scarce can tell—'Mongst friends then let it be—.</HI></L>
<L><HI>—The creatures love to cheat as well as we.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>But bless my wits! I've quite forgot the bard—</HI></L>
<L><HI>A civil soul!—By me he sends this card—</HI></L>
<L>"Presents respects—<HI>to ev'ry lady here—</HI></L>
<L>"Hopes for the honor—<HI>of a single tear."</HI></L>
<L><HI>The critics then will throw their dirt in vain,</HI></L>
<L><HI>One drop from you will wash out ev'ry stain.</HI></L>
<L>Acquaints you—<HI>(now the man is past his fright)</HI></L>
<L><HI>He holds his rout,—and here he keeps his night.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Assures you all a welcome kind and hearty,</HI></L>
<L><HI>The ladies shall play crowns—and there's the shilling party.</HI></L>

<HEAD>TO M. DE VOLTAIRE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A Letter to you from an English author will carry with it the appearance of corresponding with the enemy, not only as the two nations are at present involved in a difficult and important war, but also because in many of your late writings you seem determined to live in a state of hostility with the Bri∣tish nation. Whenever we come in your way, <Q>we are ferocious, we are islanders, we are the people whom your country has taught, we fall behind other nations in point of taste and elegance of composition; the same cause that has witheld from us a genius for painting and music, has also deprived us of the true spirit of Tragedy; and, in short, barbarism still pre∣vails among us.</Q></P>
<P>But, notwithstanding this vein of prejudice, which has discoloured almost all your <HI>fugitivepieces,</HI> there still breathes throughout your writings such a general spirit of Hu∣manity and zeal for the Honour of the Republic of Let∣ters, that I am inclined to imagine the author of the English Orphan of China (an obscure islander) may still address you upon terms of amity and literary bene∣volence.</P>
<P>As I have attempted a Tragedy upon a subject that has exercised your excellent talents, and thus have dared to try my strength in the Bow of ULYSSES, I hold my∣self in some fort accountable to M. DeVOLTAIRE for the departure I have made from his plan, and the substitu∣tion of a new fable of my own.</P>
<P>My first propensity to this story was occasioned by the remarks of an admirable critic<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Hurd, in his Commentary upon Horace.</NOTE> of our own. upon the

ORPHAN OF THE HOUSE OF CHAU, preserved to us by the industrious and sensible P. DU HALDE, which, as our learned commentator observes, amidst great wild∣ness and irregularity, has still some traces of resemblance to the beautiful models of antiquity. In my reflections upon this piece, I imagined I saw a blemish in the man∣ner of saving the Orphan, by the tame resignation of an∣other infant in his place; especially when the subject af∣forded so fair an opportunity of touching the strugglings of a parent, on so trying an occasion. It therefore oc∣curred to me, if a fable could be framed, in which the Father and the two Young Men might be interwoven with probability and perspicuity, and not embarrassed with all the perplexities of a riddle, as, you know, is the case of the HERACLIUS of CORNEILLE, that then many situations might arise, in which some of the nearest affections of the heart might be awakened: but even then I was too conscious that it must be executed by a genius very different from myself.</P>
<P>In this state of mind, sir, I heard with pleasure that M. De VOLTAIRE had produced at Paris his L'ORPHELIN DE LA CHINE: I ardently longed for a perusal of the piece, expecting that such a writer would certainly seize all the striking incidents which might naturally grow out of so pregnant a story, and that he would leave no source of passion unopened. I was in some sort, but not wholly disappointed: I saw M. De VOLTAIRE rushing into the midst of things at once; opening his subject in an alarming manner; and, after the narrative relating to GENGISKAN is over, working up his first act like a poet indeed.</P>
<P>Meum qui pectus inaniter angit Ut Magus.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the second act, he again touches the passions with a master-hand; but, like a rower who
<PB N="91" REF="100"/>
has put forth all his strength, and suddenly slackens his exertion, I saw, or imagined I saw, him give way all at once; the great tumult of the passions is over; the interest wears away; GENGISKAN talks politics; the tenderness of a mother, flying with all the strong im∣pulses of nature to the relief of her child, is thrown in∣to cold unimpassioned narrative; the <HI>role pour Pamoureux</HI> must have its place, and the rough conqueror of a whole people must instantly become <HI>Le Chevalier</HI> GENGISKAN, as errant a lover as ever sighed in the Thuilleries at Paris. Your own words, sir, strongly expressive of that manly and sensible taste, which distinguishes you through∣out Europe, occurred to me upon this occasion: <Q>Quelle place pour la galanterie que le parricide &amp; l'inceste, qui desolent une famille, &amp; la contagion qui ravage un pais? Et quel exemple plus frapant du ridicule de notre theatre, &amp; du pouvoir de l'habitude, que Corneille d'un côté, qui fait dire à Thésée.—</Q></P>
<P>Quelque ravage affreux qu'étale ici la Peste;</P>
<P><Q>L'absence aux vrais amans est encore plus funeste. Et moi, qui, soixante ans apres lui, viens faire parler une vielle Jocaste d'un viel amour: &amp; tout cela pour complaire au goût le plus fade &amp; le plus faux qui ait jamais corrompu la literature.</Q> Indeed, sir, GEN∣GISKAN, in the very moment of overwhelming a whole nation, usurping a crown, and massacring the royal fa∣mily, except one infant, whom he is in quest of, ap∣peared to me exactly like the amorous OEDIPUS in the midst of a destructive plague. <Q>Nunc non erat his lo∣cus.</Q>—How would that noble performance, that <HI>Chef d'oeuvre</HI> of your country, the ATHALIE of RACINE, have been defaced by the gallantry of an intrigue, if a tyrant had been introduced to make love to the wise of the high-priest? or if JOAD, entertaining a secret af∣fection for ATHALIE, and being asked what orders he
<PB N="92" REF="101"/>
would give relating to the delivery of his country, should answer, "aucune," none at all.—And yet this is the language of a northern conqueror, whining for a man∣darin's wife, who has no power of resisting, and hav∣ing no relation to the royal family, could not, by an intermarriage, strengthen his interest in the crown But to you, sir, who have told us that Love should reign a very tyrant in Tragedy, or not appear there at all, being unfit for the second place; to you, who have said that NERO should not hide himself behind a tapestry to overhear the conversation of his mistress and his rival, what need I urge these remarks?—To fill up the long career of a tragedy with this episodic love must certainly have been the motive that led you into this er∣ror; an error I take the liberty to call it, because I have observed it to be the hackneyed and stale stratagem, of many modern writers. Within the compass of my reading, there is hardly a bad man in any play, but he is in love with some very good woman: the scenes that pass between them, I have always remarked, are found dull and unawakening by the audience, even though adorn∣ed with all the graces of such composition as yours, of which it is but justice to say, that it bestows embel∣lishments upon every subject.</P>
<P>For me, sir, who only draw in crayons, who have no resource to those lasting colours of imagination with which you set off every thing; a writer such as I am, sir, could not presume to support that duplicity of pas∣sion which runs through your piece. I could not pre∣tend, by the powers of style, to suborn an audience in favour of those secondary passages, from which their at∣tention naturally revolts. A plainer and more simple method lay before me. I was necessitated to keep the main object as much as possible before the eye; and therefore it was that I took a survey of my subject, in order to catch at every thing that seemed to me to re∣sult
<PB N="93" REF="102"/>
with order and propriety from it. A scantiness of interesting business seemed to me a primary defect in the construction of the French ORPHAN OF CHINA, and that I imagined had its source in the early date of your play. By beginning almost "gemino ab ovo," by mak∣ing the Orphan and the mandarine's son children in their cradles, it appeared to me that you had stripped yourself of two characters, which might be produced in an amiable light, so as to engage the affections of their auditors, not only for themselves, but consequently for those also to whom they should stand in any degree of relation. From this conduct I proposed a further advantage, that of taking off the very obvious resemblance to the ANDROMACHE, which now strikes every body in your plan. This last remark I do not urge against acciden∣tal and distant coincidencies of sentiment, diction, or fable. Many of the Greek plays, we know, had a family-likeness, such as an OEDIPUS, an ELECTRA, an IPHI∣GENIA in TAURIS, in AULIS, a MEROPE, &amp;c. But what is a beauty in RACINE, seems in his great successor to be a blemish. In the former, nothing depends on the life of ASTYANAX but what was very natural, the happiness of the mother: in the latter, the fate of a kingdom is grafted upon the fortunes of an infant; and I ask your own feelings, (for no body knows the human heart better) Whether an audience is likely to take any considerable interest in the destiny of a babe, who, when your Zamti has saved him, cannot produce any change, any revolution in the affairs of China? No, sir; the conquered remain in the same abject state of vassalage, and the preservation of the infant king becomes therefore uninteresting and unimportant. He might die, sir, in cutting his teeth, of the hooping cough, or any of the disorders attendant on that tender age: whereas when the Orphan is grown up to maturity, when he is a moral agent in the piece, when a plan is laid for revenging
<PB N="94" REF="103"/>
himself on the destroyers of his family, it then becomes a more pressing motive in the mandarine's mind; nay, it is almost his duty, in such a case, to sacrifice even his own offspring for the good of his country. In your story, sir, give me leave to say, I do not see what end can be answered by ZAMTI'S loyalty: his prospect is at least so distant, that it becomes almost chimerical. And therefore as history warrants an expulsion of the Tartars, as it was not upon the first inroad, but in pro∣cess of time and experience, that they learned to incor∣porate themselves with the conquered, I had recourse to my own preconceived notions. Whether I was partially attached to them, or whether my reasonings upon your fable were just, you, sir, and the public, will determine.</P>
<P>You will perceive, sir, in the English Orphan some occasional insertions of sentiment from your elegant per∣formance. To use the expression of the late Mr. DRYDEN, when he talks of BEN JOHNSON'S imitation of the ancients, you <HI>will often track me in your snow.</HI> For this I shall make no apology, either to the public or you: none to the public, because they have applauded some strokes for which I am indebted to you; and none certainly to you, because you are well aware I have but followed the example of many admired writers; BOI∣LEAU, CORNEILLE, and RACINE, with you; and in England, MILTON, Mr. ADDISON, and Mr. POPE. It was finely said by you, (I have read the story, and take it upon trust) when it was objected to the celebrated abbè METASTASIO; as a reproach, that he had frequent transfusions of thought from your writings, <Q>Ah! le cher volcur! il m'a bien embelli.</Q> This talent of embellishing I do not pretend to; to avail myself of my reading, and to improve my own productions, is all I can pretend to; and that I flatter myself I have done, not only from you, but many of the writers of antiquity. If the authorities I have abovementioned were not suffi∣cient, I could add another very bright example, the
<PB N="95" REF="104"/>
example of M. De VOLTAIRE, whom I have often tracked, to use the same expression again, in the <HI>snow of Shakespear.</HI> The snow of SHAKESPEAR is but a cold expression; but perhaps it will be more agreeable to you, than a word of greater energy, that should convey a full idea of the astonishing powers of that great man; for we islanders have remarked of late, that M. DeVoltaire has a particular satisfaction in descanting on the faults of the most wonderful genius that ever existed since HOMER; insomuch that a very ingenious gentleman of my acquaintance tells me, that whenever you treat the English bard as a drunken savage in your <HI>avant propos,</HI> he always deems it a sure prognostic that your play is the better for him.</P>
<P>If the great scenes of SHAKESPEAR, sir; if his boundless view of all nature, the lawn, the wilder∣ness, the blasted heath, mountains, and craggy rocks, with thunder and lightening on their brows; if these cannot strike the imagination of M. De VOL∣TAIRE, how can I expect that the studied regularity of my little shrubbery should afford him any kind of pleasure? To drop the metaphor, if the following tra∣gedy does not appear to you a MONSTROUS FARCE, it is all I can reasonably expect. But whatever may be your opinion of it, I must beg that you will not make it the criterion by which you would decide concerning the taste of the English nation, or the present state of lite∣rature among us. What you have humbly said of your∣self, in order to do honour to your nation, I can assert with truth of the author of the English ORPHAN, that he is one of the worst poets now in this country. It is true, indeed, that the play has been received with uncommon applause; that so elegant a writer as the author of CREUSA and THE ROMAN FATHER was my critic and my friend; and that a great deal of very par∣ticular honour has been done me by many persons of the
<PB N="96" REF="105"/>
first distinction. But, give me leave to say, they all know the faults of the piece, as well as if it had been dis∣cussed by the academy of <HI>Belles Lettres.</HI>—We are a generous nation, sir; and the faintest approaches to merit, always meet here the warmest encouragement. One thing further I will assure you, in case you should discover any traces of barbarism in the style or fable, That if you had been present at the representation, you would have seen a theatrical splendor conducted with a <HI>bienscance</HI> unknown to the <HI>scene Francoise;</HI> the perform∣ance of the two Young Men would have made you re∣gret that they were not in your piece; and, though a weak state of health deprived the play of so fine an ac∣tress as Mrs. CIBBER, you would have beheld in MAN∣DANE a figure that would be an ornament to any stage in Europe, and you would have acknowleged that her Acting promises also to be the same: moreover, you would have seen a ZAMTI, whose exquisite powers are capable of adding Pathos and Harmony even to our great SHAKESPEAR, and have already been the chief support of some of your scenes upon the English stage.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, sir, I beg you will not imagine that I have wrote this Tragedy in the fond hope of eclipsing so celebrated a writer as you are: I had an humbler motive, <HI>propter amorem quod to imitari aveo.</HI> Could I do that in any distant degree, it would very amply gratify the ambition of,</P>
