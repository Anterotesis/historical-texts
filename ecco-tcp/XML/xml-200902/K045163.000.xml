<L>IF Heaven has into being deign'd to call</L>

<L>Nor motion's laws can speed thy active course,</L>

<L>Since there is no convexity in MIND,</L>
<L>Why are thy genial beams to parts confin'd?</L>

While the chill North with thy bright ray is blest,</L>

<L N="15">Was it decreed, fair Freedom! at thy birth,</L>
<L>That thou shou'd'st ne'er irradiate <HI>all</HI> the earth?</L>
<L>While Britain basks in thy full blaze of light,</L>
<L>Why lies sad Afric quench'd in total night?</L>
</LG>

<L>Thee only, sober Goddess! I attest,</L>
<L N="20">In smiles chastis'd, and decent graces drest.</L>
<L>Not that unlicens'd monster of the crowd,</L>
<L>Whose roar terrific bursts in peals so loud,</L>
<L>Deaf'ning the ear of Peace: fierce Faction's tool;</L>
<L>Of rash Sedition born, and mad Misrule;</L>
<L N="25">Whose stubborn mouth, rejecting Reason's rein,</L>
<L>No strength can govern, and no skill restrain;</L>
<L>Whose magic cries the frantic vulgar draw</L>
<L>To spurn at Order, and to outrage Law;</L>

To tread on grave Authority and Pow'r,</L>
<L N="30">And shake the work of ages in an hour:</L>
<L>Convuls'd her voice, and pestilent her breath,</L>
<L>She raves of mercy, while she deals out death:</L>
<L>Each blast is fate; she darts from either hand</L>
<L>Red conflagration o'er th' astonish'd land;</L>

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Author of the Tragedy of Oronoko.</NOTE> whose impassion'd strain</L>

<L>Now, when congenial themes her cares engage,</L>
<L N="40">She burns to emulate thy glowing page;</L>
<L>Her failing efforts mock her fond desires,</L>
<L>She shares thy feelings, not partakes thy fires.</L>
<L>Strange pow'r of song! the strain that warms the heart</L>
<L>Seems the same inspiration to impart;</L>
<L N="45"><PB N="4" REF="7"/>
Touch'd by the kindling energy alone,</L>
<L>We think the flame which melts us is our own;</L>

<L>Tho' not to me, sweet Bard, thy pow'rs belong,</L>

<L>For no fictitious ills these numbers flow,</L>

Perish the proud philosophy, which sought</L>

<L>Does then th' immortal principle within</L>

<L N="65">Does matter govern spirit? or is mind</L>
<L>Degraded by the form to which 'tis join'd?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No: they have heads to think, and hearts to feel,</L>
<L>And souls to act, with firm, tho' erring zeal;</L>
<L>For they have keen affections, kind desires,</L>
<L N="70">Love strong as death, and active patriot fires;</L>
<L>All the rude energy, the fervid flame,</L>
<L>Of high-soul'd passion, and ingenuous shame:</L>
<L>Strong, but luxuriant virtues boldly shoot</L>
<L>From the wild vigour of a savage root.</L>
</LG>

<L N="75">Nor weak their sense of honour's proud control,</L>

<L><PB N="6" REF="9"/>
A sense of worth, a conscience of desert,</L>
<L>A high, unbroken haughtiness of heart;</L>
<L>That self-same stuff which erst proud empires sway'd,</L>
<L N="80">Of which the conquerors of the world were made.</L>

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is a point of honour among negroes of a high spirit to die rather than to suffer their glossy skin to bear the mark of the whip. Qua-shi had somehow offended his master, a young planter with whom he had been bred up in the endearing intimacy of a play-fellow. His services had been faithful; his at∣tachment affectionate. The master resolved to punish him, and pursued him for that purpose. In trying to escape Qua-shi stumbled and fell; the master fell upon him: they wrestled long with doubtful victory; at length Qua-shi got uppermost, and, being firmly seated on his master's breast, he secured his legs with one hand, and with the other drew a sharp knife; then said, <Q>Master, I have been bred up with you from a child; I have loved you as myself: in return, you have condemned me to a punishment of which I must ever have borne the marks: thus only I can avoid them;</Q> so saying, he drew the knife with all his strength across his own throat, and sell down dead, without a groan, on his master's body.

<L>No statue snatch thee from oblivious fate!</L>
<L N="85"><PB N="7" REF="10"/>
For thou wast born where never gentle Muse</L>
<L>On Valour's grave the flow'rs of Genius strews;</L>
<L>And thou wast born where no recording page</L>
<L>Plucks the fair deed from Time's devouring rage.</L>
<L>Had Fortune plac'd thee on some happier coast,</L>
<L N="90">Where polish'd souls heroic virtue boast,</L>
<L>To thee, who sought'st a voluntary grave,</L>
<L>Th' uninjur'd honours of thy name to save,</L>
<L>Whose generous arm thy barbarous Master spar'd,</L>
<L>Altars had smok'd, and temples had been rear'd.</L>

<L N="95">Whene'er to Asric's shores I turn my eyes,</L>
<L>Horrors of deepest, deadliest guilt arise;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="11"/>
I see, by more than Fancy's mirror shewn,</L>
<L>The burning village, and the blazing town:</L>
<L>See the dire victim torn from social life,</L>
<L N="100">The shrieking babe, the agonizing wife!</L>
<L>She, wretch forlorn! is dragg'd by hostile hands,</L>
<L>To distant tyrants sold, in distant lands!</L>
<L>Transmitted miseries, and successive chains,</L>
<L>The sole sad heritage her child obtains!</L>
<L N="105">Ev'n this last wretched boon their foes deny,</L>
<L>To weep together, or together die.</L>
<L>By felon hands, by one relentless stroke,</L>
<L>See the fond links of feeling Nature broke!</L>
<L>The fibres twisting round a parent's heart,</L>
<L N="110">Torn from their grasp, and bleeding as they part.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hold, murderers, hold! nor aggravate distress;</L>
<L>Respect the passions you yourselves possess;</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="12"/>
Ev'n you, of ruffian heart, and ruthless hand,</L>
<L>Love your own offspring, love your native land.</L>
<L N="115">Ah! leave them holy Freedom's cheering smile,</L>
<L>The heav'n-taught fondness for the parent soil;</L>
<L>Revere affections mingled with our frame,</L>
<L>In every nature, every clime the same;</L>
<L>In all, these feelings equal sway maintain;</L>

<L>And Tempe's vale, and parch'd Angola's sand,</L>
<L>One equal fondness of their sons command.</L>
<L>Th' unconquer'd Savage laughs at pain and toil,</L>
<L>Basking in Freedom's beams which gild his native soil.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="125">Does thirst of empire, does desire of fame,</L>
<L>(For these are specious crimes) our rage inflame?</L>
<L>No: sordid lust of gold their fate controls,</L>
<L>The basest appetite of basest souls;</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="13"/>
Gold, better gain'd, by what their ripening sky,</L>
<L N="130">Their fertile fields, their arts

<L>What wrongs, what injuries does Oppression plead</L>
<L>To smooth the horror of th' unnatural deed?</L>
<L>What strange offence, what aggravated sin?</L>
<L>They stand convicted—of a darker skin!</L>
<L N="135">Barbarians, hold! th' opprobrious commerce spare,</L>
<L>Respect <HI>his</HI> sacred image which they bear:</L>
<L>Tho' dark and savage, ignorant and blind,</L>
<L>They claim the common privilege of kind;</L>
<L>Let Malice strip them of each other plea,</L>
<L N="140">They still are men, and men shou'd still be free.</L>
<L>Insulted Reason loaths th' inverted trade—</L>
<L>Dire change! the agent is the purchase made!</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="14"/>
Perplex'd, the baffled Muse involves the tale;</L>
<L>Nature confounded, well may language fail!</L>
<L N="145">The outrag'd Goddess with abhorrent eyes</L>
<L>Sees MAN the traffic, SOULS the merchandize!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Plead not, in reason's palpable abuse,</L>
<L>Their sense of
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nothing is more frequent than this cruel and stupid argument, that they do not <HI>feel</HI> the miseries inflicted on them as Europeans would do.</NOTE> feeling callous and obtuse:</L>
<L>From heads to hearts lies Nature's plain appeal,</L>
<L N="150">Tho' few can reason, all mankind can feel.</L>
<L>Tho' wit may boast a livelier dread of shame,</L>
<L>A loftier sense of wrong refinement claim;</L>
<L>Tho' polish'd manners may fresh wants invent,</L>
<L>And nice distinctions nicer souls torment;</L>
<L N="155">Tho' these on finer spirits heavier fall,</L>
<L>Yet natural evils are the same to all.</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="15"/>
Tho' wounds there are which reason's force may heal,</L>
<L>There needs no logic sure to make us feel.</L>
<L>The nerve, howe'er untutor'd, can sustain</L>
<L N="160">A sharp, unutterable sense of pain;</L>
<L>As exquisitely fashion'd in a slave,</L>
<L>As where unequal fate a sceptre gave.</L>
<L>Sense is as keen where Congo's sons preside,</L>
<L>As where proud Tiber rolls his classic tide.</L>
<L N="165">Rhetoric or verse may point the feeling line,</L>
<L>They do not whet sensation, but define.</L>
<L>Did ever slave less feel the galling chain,</L>
<L>When Zeno prov'd there was no ill in pain?</L>
<L><HI>Their</HI> miseries philosophic quirks deride,</L>
<L N="170">Slaves groan in pangs disown'd by Stoic pride.</L>

<L>When the fierce Sun darts vertical his beams,</L>

<L>And his strain'd eyes in burning anguish roll;</L>
<L N="175">Will the parch'd negro find, ere he expire,</L>
<L>No pain in hunger, and no heat in fire?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For him, when fate his tortur'd frame destroys,</L>
<L>What hope of present fame, or future joys?</L>
<L>For <HI>this,</HI> have heroes shorten'd nature's date;</L>
<L N="180">For <HI>that,</HI> have martyrs gladly met their fate;</L>
<L>But him, forlorn, no hero's pride sustains,</L>
<L>No martyr's blissful visions sooth his pains;</L>
<L>Sullen, he mingles with his kindred dust,</L>
<L>For he has learn'd to dread the Christian's trust;</L>
<L N="185"><PB N="14" REF="17"/>
To him what mercy can that Pow'r display,</L>
<L>Whose servants murder, and whose sons betray?</L>
