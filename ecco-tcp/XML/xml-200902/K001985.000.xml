<HEAD>To the Right Honourable CHARLES Earl of <HI>Dorset</HI> and <HI>Middlesex,</HI> Lord Chamberlain of His Majesty's Houshold, and Knight of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A Young Poet is liable to the same Vanity and Indiscre∣tion with a Young Lover; and the Great Man that smiles upon one, and the Fine Woman that looks kindly upon t'other, are each of 'em in Danger of having the Favour publish'd with the first Opportunity.</P>
<P>But there may be a different Motive, which will a little distinguish the Offenders. For tho' one should have a Vani∣ty in ruining another's Reputation, yet the other may only have an Ambition to advance his own. And I beg leave, my Lord, that I may plead the latter, both as the Cause and Excuse of this Dedication.</P>
<P>Whoever is King, is also the Father of his Country; and as no Body can dispute Your Lordship's <HI>Monarchy</HI> in <HI>Poetry;</HI> so all that are concern'd, ought to acknowledge Your Uni∣versal Patronage: And it is only presuming on the Privilege of a Loyal Subject, that I have ventur'd to make this my Address of Thanks to your Lordship, which at the same time includes a Prayer for Your Protection.</P>
<P>I am not Ignorant of the Common Form of Poetical Dedications, which are generally made up of Panegyricks, where the Authors endeavour to distinguish their Patrons, by the shining Characters they give them above other Men. But that, my Lord, is not my Business at this time, nor is Your Lordship <HI>now</HI> to be distinguish'd. I am contented
<PB REF="4"/>
with the Honour I do my self in this Epistle, without the Vanity of attempting to add to, or explain Your Lordship's Character.</P>
<P>I confess it is not without some struggling, that I behave my self in this Case as I ought: For it is very hard to be pleased with a Subject, and yet forbear it. But I chuse ra∣ther to follow <HI>Pliny</HI>'s Precept, than his Example, when in his Panegyrick to the Emperor <HI>Trajan,</HI> he says,
<Q><L>Nec minus considerabo quid aures ejus pati</L>
<L>possint, Quam quid virtutibus debeatur.</L></Q></P>
<P>I hope I may be excus'd the Pedantry of a Quotation, when it is so justly apply'd. Here are some Lines in the Print, (and which Your Lordship read before this Play was Acted) that were omitted on the Stage; and particularly one whole Scene in the Third Act, which not only helps the Design forward with less Precipitation, but also heightens the ridiculous Character of <HI>Foresight,</HI> which indeed seems to be maim'd without it. But I found my self in great Danger of a long Play, and was glad to help it where I could. Tho' notwithstanding my Care, and the kind Reception it had from the Town, I could heartily wish it yet shorter: But the Number of different Characters represented in it, would have been too much crowded in less room.</P>
<P>This Reflection on Prolixity, (a Fault for which scarce any one Beauty will attone) warns me not to be tedi∣ous now, and detain Your Lordship any longer with the Trifles of,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE> <SIGNED>Your Lordship's most Obedient, and most Humble Servant, William Congreve.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE. 
<STAGE>Spoken at the Opening of the New House, By Mr. <HI>Betterton.</HI></STAGE></HEAD>
<L>THE Husbandman in vain renews his Toil,</L>
<L>To cultivate each Tear a hungry Soil;</L>
<L>And fondly hopes for rich and generous Fruit,</L>
<L>When what shou'd feed the Tree, devours the Root:</L>
<L>Th' unlanden Boughs, he sees, bode certain Dearth,</L>
<L>Unless transplanted to more kindly Earth.</L>
<L>So the poor Husbands of the Stage, who found</L>
<L>Their Labours lost upon th' ungrateful Ground,</L>
<L>This last and only Remedy have prov'd;</L>
<L>And hope new Fruit from ancient Stocks remov'd.</L>
<L>Well may they hope, when you so kindly aid,</L>
<L>And plant a Soil which you so rich have made.</L>
<L>As Nature gave the World to Man's first Age,</L>
<L>So from your Bounty we receive this Stage;</L>
<L>The Freedom Man was born to you've restor'd,</L>
<L>And to our World such Plenty you afford,</L>
<L>It seems like <HI>Eden,</HI> fruitful of its own Accord.</L>
<L>But since in <HI>Paradise</HI> frail Flesh gave way,</L>
<L>And when but two were made, both went astray;</L>
<L>Forbear your Wonder, and the Fault forgive,</L>
<L>If in our larger Family we grieve</L>
<L>One falling <HI>Adam,</HI> and one tempted <HI>Eve.</HI></L>
<L>We who remain, would gratefully repay</L>
<L>What our Endeavours can, and bring this Day,</L>
<L>The First-fruit Off'ring of a Virgin Play.</L>
<L>We hope there's something that may please each Taste,</L>
<L>And tho' of homely Fare we make the Feast,</L>
<L>Yet you will find Variety at least.</L>
<L><PB REF="8"/>
There's Humour, which for chearful Friends we got;</L>
<L>And for the thinking Party there's a Plot.</L>
<L>We've something too to gratifie ill Nature,</L>
<L>(If there be any here) and that is Satire.</L>
<L>Tho' Satire scarce dares grin, 'tis grown so mild;</L>
<L>Or only shews its Teeth, as if it smil'd.</L>
<L>As Asses Thistles, Poets mumble Wit;</L>
<L>And dare not bite, for fear of being bit.</L>
<L>They hold their Pens, as Swords are held by Fools,</L>
<L>And are afraid to use their own Edge-Tools.</L>
<L>Since the <HI>Plain-Dealer</HI>'s Scenes of Manly Rage,</L>
<L>Not one has dar'd to lash this Crying Age.</L>
<L>This time, the Poet owns the bold Essay,</L>
<L>Yet hopes there's no ill Manners in his Play:</L>
<L>And he declares by me, he has design'd</L>
<L>Affront to none, but frankly speaks his Mind.</L>
<L>And shou'd th' ensuing Scenes not chance to hit,</L>
<L>He offers but this one Excuse, 'Twas writ</L>
<L>Before your late Encouragement of Wit.</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE, 
<STAGE>Spoken at the Opening of the New House. By Mrs. <HI>Bracegirdle.</HI></STAGE></HEAD>
<L>SURE Providence, at first, design'd this Place</L>
<L>To be the Player's Refuge in Distress;</L>
<L>For still in every Storm they all run hither,</L>
<L>As to a Shed, that shields 'em from the Weather.</L>
<L>But thinking of this Change which last befel us,</L>
<L>It's like what I have heard our Poets tell us:</L>
<L>For when behind our Scenes their Suits are pleading,</L>
<L>To help their Love, sometimes they show their Reading;</L>
<L>And wanting ready Cash to pay for Hearts,</L>
<L>They top their Learning on us, and their Parts.</L>
<L>Once of Philosophers they told us Stories,</L>
<L>Whom, as I think, they call'd<HI>—Py—Pythagories.</HI></L>
<L>I'm sure 'tis some such <HI>Latin</HI> Name they give 'em,</L>
<L>And we, who know no better, must believe 'em.</L>
<L>Now to these Men (say they) such Souls were given,</L>
<L>That after Death ne'er went to Hell nor Heaven,</L>
<L>But liv'd, I know not how, in Beasts; and then,</L>
<L>When many Years were past, in Men again.</L>
<L>Methinks, we <HI>Players</HI> resemble such a Soul,</L>
<L>That does from Bodies, we from Houses stroll.</L>
<L>Thus <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s Soul, of old that was,</L>
<L>May now be damn'd to animate an Ass;</L>
<L>Or in this very House, for ought we know,</L>
<L>Is doing painful Pennance in some <HI>Beau:</HI></L>
<L>And this our Audience, which did once resort</L>
<L>To shining Theatres to see our Sport,</L>
<L>Now find us toss'd into a Tennis-Court.</L>
<L>These Walls but t'other Day were fill'd with Noise</L>
<L>Of roaring Gamesters, and your <HI>Damme Boys:</HI></L>
<L>Then bounding Balls and Rackets they encompass'd,</L>
<L>And now they're fill'd with Jests, and Flights, and Bombast!</L>
<L>I vow, I don't much like this Transmigration,</L>
<L>Strolling from Place to Place, by Circulation.</L>
<L>Grant, Heaven, we don't return to our first Station.</L>
<L>I know not what these think, but for my Part,</L>
<L>I can't reflect without an aking Heart,</L>
<L>How we should end in our Original, a Cart.</L>
<L>But we can't fear, since you're so good to save us,</L>
<L>That you have only set us up to leave us.</L>
<L>Thus from the past, we hope for future Grace,</L>
<L>I beg it—</L>
<L>And some here know I have a begging Face.</L>
<L>Then pray continue this your kind Behaviour,</L>
<L>For a clear Stage won't do, without your Favour.</L>

<P>Was <HI>Epictetus</HI> a real Cook, or did he only write Receipts?</P>

<SPEAKER>Jere.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, you're a Gentleman, and probably understand this fine Feeding: But if you please, I had rather be at Board-Wages. Does your <HI>Epictetus,</HI> or your <HI>Seneca</HI> here, or any of these poor, rich Rogues, teach you how to pay your Debts without Mony? Will they shut up the Mouths of your Creditors? Will <HI>Plato</HI> be Bail for you! Or <HI>Dio∣genes,</HI> because he understands Confinements, and liv'd in a Tub, go to Prison for you?

<PB N="2" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sirrah, I have no Mony, you know it; and there∣fore resolve to rail at all that have: And in that I but follow the Examples of the wisest and wittiest Men in all Ages; these Poets and Philosophers whom you naturally hate, for just such another Reason; because they abound in Sense, and you are a Fool.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jere.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Sir, I am a Fool, I know it: And yet, Heav'n help me, I'm poor enough to be a Wit—But I was always a Fool, when I told you what your Expences would bring you to; your Coaches and your Liveries; your Treats and your Balls; your being in Love with a Lady, that did not care a Farthing for you in your Prosperity; and keeping Company with Wits, that car'd for nothing but your Prospe∣rity; and now when you are poor, hate you as much as they do one another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; and now I am poor, I have an opportunity to be re∣veng'd on 'em all; I'll pursue <HI>Angelica</HI> with more Love than ever, and appear more notoriously her Admirer in this Restraint, than when I openly rival'd the rich Fops that made Court to her; so shall my Po∣verty be a Mortification to her Pride, and perhaps make her compassi∣onate the Love, which has principally reduc'd me to this Lowness of Fortune. And for the Wits, I'm sure I'm in a Condition to be e∣ven with them.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jere.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, your Condition is pretty even with theirs, that's the truth on't.</P>

<P>Now Heav'n of Mercy continue the Tax upon Paper; you don't mean to Write!</P>

<P>Yes, I do; I'll write a Play.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jere.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hem!—Sir, if you please to give me a small Certificate of three Lines—only to certifie those whom it may concern, That the Bearer hereof, <HI>Jeremy Fetch</HI> by Name, has for the space of seven Years truly and faithfuly serv'd <HI>Valentine Legend,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and that he is not now turn'd away for any Misdemeanour, but does voluntarily dismiss his Master from any future Authority over him.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sirrah, you shall live with me still.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jere.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, it's impossible—I may die with you, starve with you, or be damn'd with your Works: But to live even three Days, the Life of a Play, I no more expect it, than to be Cannoniz'd for a Muse after my Decease.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are witty, you Rogue, I shall want your help;—I'll have you learn to make Couplets, to tag the Ends of Acts; d'ye hear, get the Maids to Crambo in an Evening, and learn the knack of rhiming, you may arrive at the height of a Song, sent by an unknown Hand, or a Chocolate-House Lampoon.</P>

<SPEAKER>Jere.</SPEAKER>
<P>But Sir, is this the way to recover your Father's Favour? Why Sir <HI>Sampson</HI> will be irreconcilable. If your younger Brother shou'd come from Sea, he'd never look upon you again. You're un∣done, Sir; you're ruin'd; you won't have a Friend left in the World, if you turn Poet—Ah Pox confound that <HI>Will</HI>'s Coffee-House, it has ruin'd more Young Men than the <HI>Royal-Oak</HI> Lottery—Nothing thrives that belongs to't. The Man of the House would have been an Alderman by this time with half the Trade, if he had set up in the City—For my part, I never sit at the Door, that I don't get dou∣ble the Stomach that I do at a Horse-Race. The Air upon <HI>Banstead-Downs</HI> is nothing to it for a Whetter; yet I never see it, but the Spirit of Famine appears to me, sometimes like a decay'd Porter, worn out with Pimping, and carrying <HI>Billet-doux</HI> and Songs; not like other Porters for Hire, but for the Jest's sake. Now like a thin Chair-man, melted down to half his Proportion, with carrying a Poet upon Tick to visit some great Fortune; and his Fare to be paid him like the Wages of Sin, either at the Day of Marriage, or the Day of Death.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, Sir; can you proceed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jere.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sometimes like a bilk'd Bookseller, with a meagre terri∣fy'd Countenance, that looks as if he had written for himself, or were resolv'd to turn Author, and bring the rest of his Brethren into the same Condition. And lastly, in the Form of a worn-out Punk, with Verses in her Hand, which her Vanity had preferr'd to Settlements, without a whole Tatter to her Tail, but as ragged as one of the Muses; or as if she were carrying her Linnen to the Paper-Mill, to be converted into Folio Books, of Warning to all young Maids not to prefer Poetry to good Sense; or lying in the Arms of a needy Wit, before the Embraces of a wealthy Fool.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tatt.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Scandal,</HI> you will not be so ungenerous—O, I shall lose my Reputation of Secresie for ever—I shall never be receiv'd but upon Publick Days, and my Visits will never be admitted beyond a Drawing-Room: I shall never see a Bed-Chamber again, never be lock'd in a Closet, nor run behind a Screen, or under a Table; never be distinguish'd among the Waiting-Women by the Name of Trusty Mr. <HI>Tattle</HI> more—You will not be so cruel.</P>

<P>Well, begin then: But take notice, if you are so ill a Painter, that I cannot know the Person by your Picture of her, you must be con∣demn'd, like other bad Painters, to write the Name at the bottom.</P>

<P>What, you will allow an absent Lover—</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>No, I'll allow a Lover present with his Mistress to be par∣ticular—But otherwise I think his Passion ought to give place to his Manners.</P>

<P>You are the most mistaken in the World; there is no Crea∣ture perfectly Civil but a Husband. For in a little time he grows only rude to his Wife, and that is the highest good Breeding, for it begets his Civility to other People. Well, I'll tell you News; but I suppose you hear your Brother <HI>Benjamin</HI> is landed: And my Brother <HI>Fore∣sight's</HI> Daughter is come out of the Country—I assure you, there's a Match talk'd of by the Old People—Well, if he be but as great a Sea-Beast as she is a Land-Monster, we shall have a most Amphibious Breed—The Progeny will be all Otters; he has been bred at Sea, and she has never been out of the Country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pox take'em, their Conjunction bodes me no good, I'm sure.</P>

<P>Now you talk of Conjunction, my Brother <HI>Foresight</HI> has cast both their Nativities, and Prognosticates an Admiral and an eminent Justice of the Peace to be the Issue-Male of their two Bo∣dies; 'tis the most superstitious Old Fool! He would have per∣suaded me, that this was an unlucky Day, and would not let me come abroad: But I invented a Dream, and sent him to <HI>Artime∣dorus</HI>

<P>Pooh, No I thank you, I have enough to do to take care of my own. Well; but I'll come and see you one of these Morn∣ings: I here you have a great many Pictures.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tatt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have a pretty good Collection at your Service, some O∣riginals.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hang him, he has nothing but the <HI>Seasons</HI> and the <HI>Twelve Caesars,</HI> paultry Copies; and the <HI>Five Senses,</HI> as ill represented as they are in himself: And he himself is the only Original you will see there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frail.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but I hear he has a Closet of Beauties.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, all that have done him Favours, if you will believe him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frail.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, let me see those, Mr. <HI>Tattle.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tatt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh Madam, those are sacred to Love and Contemplation. No Man but the Painter and my self was ever bless'd with the Sight.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frail.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but a Woman—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tatt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor Woman, 'till she consented to have her Picture there too—for then she is obliged to keep the Secret.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scan.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; come to me if you wou'd see Pictures.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frail.</SPEAKER>
<P>You?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes faith, I can shew you your own Picture, and most of your Acquaintance to the Life, and as like as at <HI>Kneller</HI>'s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frail.</SPEAKER>
<P>O lying Creature—<HI>Valentine,</HI> does not he lye?—I can't believe a Word he says.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>No indeed, he speaks Truth now: For as <HI>Tattle</HI> has Pi∣ctures of all that have granted him Favours, he has the Pictures of all that have refus'd him; if Satires, Descriptions, Characters and Lampoons are Pictures.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, mine are most in black and white.—And yet there are some set out in their true Colours, both Men and Women. I can shew you Pride, Folly, Affectation, Wantonness, Inconstancy, Cove∣tousness,
<PB N="14" REF="24"/>
Dissimulation, Malice, and Ignorance, all in one Piece. Then I can shew you Lying, Foppery, Vanity, Cowardise, Bragging, Leche∣ry, Impotence, and Ugliness, in another Piece; and yet one of these is a celebrated Beauty, and t'other a profest Beau. I have Paintings too, some pleasant enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frail.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, let's hear 'em.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Frail.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Devil! Well, but that Story is not true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scan.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have some Hieroglyphicks too, I have a Lawyer with a hundred Hands, two Heads, and but one Face; a Divine with two Faces, and one Head; and I have a Soldier with his Brains in his Belly, and his Heart where his Head should be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>No Head.</P>

<P>Pooh, this is all Invention. Have you ne'er a Poet?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I have a Poet weighing Words, and selling Praise for Praise, and a Critick picking his Pocket. I have another large Piece too, representing a School, where there are huge proportion'd Criticks, with long Wigs, lac'd Coats, <HI>Steinkirk</HI> Cravats, and terrible Faces; with Cat-calls in their Hands, and Hornbooks about their Necks.

<SP>

<P>I will; because I have a Tender for your Ladyship.</P>

<P>That's somewhat the better Reason, to my Opinion.</P>

<P>Ha, How?

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fore.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, wou'd you be gadding too? Sure all Females are mad today—It is of evil Portent, and bodes Mischief to the Master of a Family—I remember an old Prophecy written by <HI>Messehalah</HI> the <HI>Arabian,</HI> and thus translated by a Reverend <HI>Buckinghamshire</HI> Bard:<Q><L>When Housewifes all the House forsake,</L>
<L>And leave good Man to Brew and Bake,</L>

<L>That House doth stond upon its Head;</L>
<L>And when the Head is set in Grond,</L>
<L>Ne marl, if it be fruitful fond.</L></Q> Fruitful, the Head fruitful, that bodes Horns; the Fruit of the Head is Horns.—Dear Niece, stay at home—for by the Head of the House is meant the Husband; the Prophecy needs no Explanation.</P>

<P>Yes, yes; while there's one Woman left the Prophecy is not in full Force.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>But my Inclinations are in force; I have a mind to go a∣broad, and if you won't lend me your Coach, I'll take a Hackney, or a Chair, and leave you to erect a Scheme, and find who's in Con∣junction with your Wife. Why don't you keep her at home, if you're Jealous when she's abroad? You know my Aunt is a little Retrograde (as you call it) in her Nature.

What a world of Fire and Candle, Matches and Tinderboxes did you purchase! one would have thought

<P>Haste, ay, ay; haste enough, my Son <HI>Ben</HI> will be in Town to Night—I have order'd my Lawyer to draw up Wri∣tings of Settlement and Jointure—All shall be done to Night—No matter for the time; prithee, Brother <HI>Foresight,</HI> leave Supersti∣tion—Pox o' th' time; there's no time but the time present, there's no more to be said of what's past, and all that is to come will happen.

<P>I tell you I am wise; and <HI>sapiens dominabitur astris;</HI> there's Latin for you to prove it, and an Argument to confound your <HI>Ephemeris</HI>—Ignorant!—I tell you I have travell'd old <HI>Fircu,</HI> and know the Globe.

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fore.</SPEAKER>
<P>But can't you converse at home?—I own it, I think there's no Happiness like conversing with an agreeable Man: I don't quarrel at that, nor I don't think but your Conversation was very innocent; but the Place is publick, and to be seen with a Man in a Hackney-Coach is scandalous: What if any Body else should have seen you alight, as I did?—How can any Body be happy, while they're in perpetual Fear of being seen and censur'd?—Be∣sides it would not only reflect upon you, Sister, but me.</P>

<P>Pooh, here's a Clutter—why should it reflect upon you?—I don't doubt but you have thought your self happy in a Hack∣ney-Coach before now.—If I had gone to <HI>Knights-bridge,</HI> or to <HI>Chelsey,</HI> or to <HI>Spring-Garden,</HI> or <HI>Barn-Elms</HI> with a Man alone—something might have been said.</P>

You have a Rich Hus∣band, and are provided for, I am at a loss, and have no great Stock either of Fortune or Reputation; and therefore must look sharply about me. Sir <HI>Sampson</HI> has a Son that is expected to Night; and by the Account I have heard of his Education, can be no Conjurer: The Estate you know is to be made over to him:—Now if I could wheedle him, Sister, ha?

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Prue.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, must I tell a Lie then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tatt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, if you would be well bred. All well-bred Persons Lie—Besides, you are a Woman, you must never speak what you think: Your Words must contradict your Thoughts; but your Actions may contradict your Words. So, when I ask you if you can Love me, you must say no, but you must Love me too—If I tell you you are Handsome, you must deny it, and say I flatter you—But you must think your self more Charming than I speak you;—and like me, for the Beauty which I say you have, as much as if I had it my self—If I ask you to Kiss me, you must be angry, but you must not refuse me. If I ask you for more, you must be more angry,—but more complying; and as soon as ever I make you say you'll cry out, you must be sure to hold your Tongue.</P>

<P>Faith, Madam, you are in the right; no more I have, as I hope to be sav'd; I never had it in my Power to say any thing to a Lady's Prejudice in my Life—For as I was telling you, Ma∣dam, I have been the most unsuccesful Creature living, in things of that Nature; and never had the good Fortune to be trusted once with a Lady's Secret, not once.</P>

<P>O Pox, <HI>Scandal,</HI> that was too far put—Never have told Particulars, Madam. Perhaps I might have talk'd as of a Third Person—or have introduc'd an Amour of my own, in Conversati∣on, by way of Novel: But never have explain'd Particulars.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>But whence comes the Reputation of Mr. <HI>Tattle</HI>'s Secresie, if he was never trusted?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why thence it arises—The Thing is proverbially spoken; but may be apply'd to him—As if we should say in general Terms, he only is Secret who never was trusted; a Saty∣rical Proverb upon our Sex—There's another upon yours
<PB N="32" REF="42"/>
—As she is chaste, who was never ask'd the Question. That's all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>A couple of very civil Proverbs, truly: 'Tis hard to tell whether the Lady or Mr. <HI>Tattle</HI> be the more oblig'd to you. For you found her Virtue upon the Backwardness of the Men; and his Secresie upon the Mistrust of the Women.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tatt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gad, it's very true, Madam, I think we are oblig'd to ac∣quit our selves—And for my part—But your Ladyship is to speak first—</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Am I? Well, I freely confess I have resisted a great deal of Temptation.</P>

<P>It was there, I suppose, you got the Nick-name of the <HI>Great Turk</HI></P>

<P>True; I was call'd <HI>Turk-Tattle</HI> all over the Parish—The next <HI>Sunday,</HI> all the Old Women kept their Daughters at home, and the Parson had not half his Congregation. He would have brought me into the Spiritual Court, but I was reveng'd up∣on him, for he had a handsom Daughter whom I initiated into the

Science. But I repented it afterwards, for it was talk'd of in Town—And a Lady of Quality that shall be nameless, in a ra∣ging Fit of Jealousie, came down in her Coach and Six Horses, and expos'd her self upon my Account; Gad, I was sorry for it with all my Heart—You know whom I mean—You know where we raffled—</P>

The Rogue has not a Drachm of generous Love about him: All Interest, all Interest; he's an undone Scoundrel, and Courts your Estate: Body o' me, he does not care a Doit for your Person.</P>

<P>I'm pretty even with him, Sir <HI>Sampson;</HI> for if ever I could have lik'd any thing in him, it should have been his Estate too: But since that's gone, the Bait's off, and the naked Hook appears.</P>

<P>Odsbud, well spoken; and you are a Wiser Woman than I thought you were: For most young Women now a-days are to be tempted with a naked Hook.</P>

<P>If I Marry, Sir <HI>Sampson,</HI> I'm for a good Estate with any Man, and for any Man with a good Estate: Therefore if I were oblig'd to make Choice, I declare I'd rather have you than your Son.</P>

<P>Faith and Troth you're a Wise Woman, and I'm glad to hear you say so; I was afraid you were in Love with the Re∣probate: Odd, I was sorry for you with all my Heart: Hang him, Mungrel; cast him off; you shall see the Rogue shew him∣self, and make Love to some desponding <HI>Cadua</HI> of Fourscore for Sustenance. Odd, I love to see a young Spendthrift forc'd to cling to an Old Woman for Support, like Ivy round a dead Oak: Faith

<P>As long as one must not speak one's Mind, one had better not speak at all, I think, and truly I won't tell a Lie for the mat∣ter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ben.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, you say true in that, it's but a folly to lie: For to speak one thing, and to think just the contrary way; is as it were, to look one way, and to row another. Now, for my part d'ye see, I'm for carrying things above Board, I'm not for keeping any thing under Hatches,—so that if you ben't as willing as I, say so a God's name, there's no harm done; may-hap you may beshame∣fac'd; some Maidens, thof' they love a Man well enough, yet they don't care to tell'n so to's Face: If that's the Case, why Si∣lence gives Consent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I'm sure it is not so, for I'll speak sooner than you should believe that; and I'll speak Truth, tho' one should always tell a Lie to a Man; and I don't care, let my Father do what he will; I'm too big to be whipp'd, so I'll tell you plainly, I don't like you, nor love you at all, nor never will, that's more: So, there's your Answer for you; and don't trouble me no more, you ugly thing.</P>

<P>Look you, Young Woman, you may learn to give good Words however. I spoke you fair, d'ye see, and civil.—As for

your Love or your Liking, I don't value it of a Rope's end;—And may-hap I like you as little as you do me:—What I said was in obedience to Father; Gad, I fear a whipping no more than you do. But I tell you one thing, if you should give such Lan∣guage at Sea, you'd have a Cat o' Nine-tails laid cross your Shoul∣ders. Flesh! who are you? You heard t'other handsome Young Woman speak civilly to me, of her own accord: Whatever you think of your self, Gad I don't think you are any more to compare to her, than a Can of Small-beer to a Bowl of Punch.</P>

Odd, there's ne'er a young Fellow worth hanging,—that is a very young Fellow—Pize on 'em, they never think be∣forehand of any thing;—And if they commit Matrimony, 'tis as they commit Murder, out of a Frolick: And are ready to hang themselves, or to be hang'd by the Law, the next Morning:—Odso, have a care, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Therefore I ask your Advice, Sir <HI>Sampson:</HI> I have For∣tune enough to make any Man easie that I can like; if there were such a thing as a young agreeable Man, with a reasonable Stock of good Nature and Sense—For I would neither have an absolute Wit, nor a Fool.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Samp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Odd, you are hard to please, Madam; to find a young Fellow that is neither a Wit in his own Eye, nor a Fool in the Eye of the World, is a very hard Task. But, Faith and Troth, you speak very discreetly; for I hate both a Wit and a Fool.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>She that marries a Fool, Sir <HI>Sampson,</HI> commits the Re∣putation of her Honesty or Understanding to the Censure of the World: And she that marries a very witty Man, submits both to the Severity and insolent Conduct of her Husband. I should like a Man of Wit for a Lover, because I would have such an one in my Power; but I would no more be his Wife than his Enemy. For his Malice is not a more terrible Consequence of his Aversion, than his Jealousie is of his Love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Samp.</SPEAKER>
<P>None of old <HI>Foresight</HI>'s <HI>Sybills</HI> ever utter'd such a Truth. Odsbud, you have won my Heart: I hate a Wit; I had a Son that was spoil'd among 'em; a good hopeful Lad, 'till he learn'd to be a Wit—And might have risen in the State—But, a Pox on't, his Wit run him out of his Mony, and now his Poverty has run him out of his Wits.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir <HI>Sampson,</HI> as your Friend, I must tell you, you are very much abus'd in that matter; he's no more mad than you are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Samp.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, Madam! Would I could prove it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can tell you how that may be done—But it is a thing that would make me appear to be too much concern'd in your Affairs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Samp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Odsbud, I believe she likes me—
<STAGE>[Aside.]</STAGE>—Ah, Madam, all my Affairs are scarce worthy to be laid at your Feet; and I wish, Madam, they stood in a better Posture, that I might make a more becoming Offer to a Lady of your incompara∣ble
<PB N="67" REF="77"/>
Beauty and Merit.—If I had <HI>Peru</HI> in one Hand, and <HI>Mexico</HI> in t'other, and the <HI>Eastern</HI> Empire under my Feet, it would make me only a more glorious Victim to be offer'd at the Shrine of your Beauty.</P>

<P>Bless me, Sir <HI>Sampson,</HI> what's the matter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Samp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Odd, Madam, I love you—And if you would take my Advice in a Husband—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, hold, Sir <HI>Sampson.</HI> I ask'd your Advice for a Hus∣band, and you are giving me your Consent—I was indeed thinking to propose something like it in Jest, to satisfie you about <HI>Valentine:</HI> For if a Match were seemingly carried on between you and me, it would oblige him to throw off his Disguise of Madness, in apprehension of losing me: For you know he has long pre∣tended a Passion for me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Samp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gadzooks, a most ingenious Contrivance—If we were to go throw with it. But why must the Match only be seemingly carried on?—Odd, let it be a real Contract.</P>

<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>O fie, Sir <HI>Sampson,</HI> what would the World say?</P>

<P>Say, they would say you were a wise Woman, and I a happy Man. Odd, Madam, I'll love you as long as I live; and leave you a good Jointure when I die.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay; but that is not in your Power, Sir <HI>Sampson;</HI> for when <HI>Valentine</HI> confesses himself in his Senses, he must make over his Inheritance to his younger Brother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Samp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Odd, you're cunning, a wary Baggage! Faith and Troth I like you the better—But, I warrant you, I have a Proviso in the Obligation in Favour of my self—Body o'me, I have a Trick to turn the Settlement upon the Issue Male of our two Bodies begotten. Odsbud, let us find Children, and I'll find an Estate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will you? well, do you find the Estate, and leave the t'other to me—</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Samp.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Rogue! But I'll trust you. And will you consent? Is it a Match then?</P>
</SP>

<P>Let me consult my Lawyer concerning this Obligation; and if I find what you propose practicable, I'll give you my An∣swer.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Sir Samp.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my Heart;—Come in with me, and I'll lend you the Bond,—You shall consult your Lawyer, and I'll consult a Parson; Odzooks I'm a young Man: Odzooks I'm a young Man, and I'll make it appear—Odd, you're devilish Handsom: Faith and Troth you're very Handsom, and I'm ve∣ry
<PB N="68" REF="78"/>
Young, and very Lusty—Odsbud, Hussy, you know how to chuse, and so do I;—Odd, I think we are very well met;—Give me your Hand, Odd let me kiss it; 'tis as warm and as soft—as what?—Odd, as t'other Hand—give me t'other Hand, and I'll mumble 'em, and kiss 'em 'till they melt in my Mouth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, Sir <HI>Sampson</HI>—You're profuse of your Vigor before your time: You'll spend your Estate before you come to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Samp.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, only give you a Rent-roll of my Possessi∣ons—Ah! Baggage—I warrant you; for little <HI>Sampson:</HI> Odd, <HI>Sampson</HI>'s a very good Name for an able Fellow: Your <HI>Sampsons</HI> were strong Dogs from the Beginning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have a care, and don't over-act your Part—If you remember, the strongest <HI>Sampson</HI> of your Name pull'd an old House over his Head at last.</P>

Oh! methinks I'm sick when I think of a Man; and if I can't have one, I would go to sleep all my Life: For when I'm awake, it makes me wish and long, and I don't know for what—And I'd rather be al∣ways asleep, than sick with Thinking.</P>

<P>Why, you impudent Tarpawlin! Sirrah, do you bring your Fore-castle Jests upon your Father? But I shall be even with you, I won't give you a Groat. Mr. <HI>Buckram,</HI> is the Con∣veyance so worded, that nothing can possibly descend to this Scoundrel?

<P>Lawyer, I believe there's many a Cranny and Leak un∣stopp'd in your Conscience—If so be that one had a Pump to your Bosom, I believe we should discover a foul Hold. They say a Witch will sail in a Sieve—But I believe the Devil would not venture abroad o'your Conscience. And that's for you.</P>

Look you, Friend, if I may advise you, when she's going, for that you must expect, I have Experience of her, when she's going, let her go. For no Matrimony is tough enough to hold her, and if she can't drag her Anchor along with her, she'll break her Cable, I can tell you that. Who's here? the Madman?</P>

You have not more Faults than he has Virtues; and 'tis hardly more Pleasure to me, that I can make him and my self happy, than that I can punish you.</P>

<P>'Tis an unreasonable Accusation, that you lay upon our Sex: You tax us with Injustice, only to cover your own want of Merit.
