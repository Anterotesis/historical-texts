<BYLINE>BY DR. AKENSIDE<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Dr. Mark Akenside was born on the 9th of November, 1721, at Newcastle upon Tyne. His father Mark was a butcher of the Pres∣byterian Sect. He received the first part of his education at the gram∣mar school of Newcastle, and was afterwards instructed by Mr. Wilson, who kept a private academy. Being intended for the office of a Dis∣senting minister, he was sent at the age of eighteen years to Edinburgh; but, altering his first design, he turned his application to the study of physick, which he afterwards continued at Leyden, where he took his degree of Doctor on the 16th of May, 1744. He first practised in his profession at Northampton, from whence he removed to Hampstead, and afterwards to London. He was chosen Fellow of the Royal Society; became a physician to St. Thomas's Hospital; was admitted by manda∣mus to the degree of Doctor of Physic in the university of Cambridge; and was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in London. Upon the Settlement of the Queen's household he was appointed one of the physicians to her Majesty. He died of a putrid fever June 23, 1770, and was buried at the church of St. James's, Westminster.</NOTE>. MDCCXLVI.</BYLINE>

<HEAD>ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>The Nymphs who preside over springs and rivulets are addressed at day-break in honour of their several functions, and of the relations which they bear to the natural and to the moral world. Their origin is deduced from the first allegorical dei∣ties, or powers of nature; according to the doctrine of the old mythological poets, concerning the generation of the Gods and the rise of things. They are then successively considered, as giving motion to the air and exciting summer-breezes; as nourishing and beautifying the vegetable world; as contributing to the fulness of navigable rivers, and consequently to the main¦tenance of commerce, and by that means to the maritime part of military power. Next is represented their favourable influence upon health, when assisted by rural exercise; which introduces their connection with the art of physic, and the happy effects of mineral, medicinal springs. Lastly, they are celebrated for the friendship which the Muses bear them, and for the true inspira∣tion which temperance only can receive; in opposition to the enthusiasm of the more licentious poets.</P>

<L>Were Love<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><P>—<HI>Love</HI>—</P><P><HI>Elder than Chaos.</HI>] Hesiod, in his Theogony, gives a different account, and makes Chaos the eldest of beings; though he assigns to Love neither father nor superior; which circumstance is particularly mentioned by Phaedrus, in Plato's Banquet, as being observable not only in Hesiod, but in all other writers both in verse and prose: and on the same occasion he cites a line from Parmenides, in which Love is expressly styled the eldest of all the gods. Yet Aristo∣phanes, in The Birds, affirms, that <Q>Chaos, and Night, and Erebus, and Tartarus, were first; and that Love was produced from an egg, which the sable-winged night deposited in the immense bosom of Erebus.</Q> But it must be observed, that the Love designed by this comic poet was always distinguished from the other, from that original and self-existent being the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> of Plato, and meant only the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or second person of the old Grecian trinity; to whom is inscribed an hymn among those which pass under the name of Or∣pheus, where he is called Protogonos, or the first-begotten, is said to have been born of an egg, and is represented as the principal or origin of all these external appearances of nature. In the fragments of Or∣pheus, collected by Henry Stephens, he is named Phanes, the discove∣rer or discloser; who unfolded the ideas of the supreme intelligence, and exposed them to the perception of inferior beings in this visible frame of the world; as Macrobius, and Proclus, and Athenagoras, all agree to interpret the several passages of Orpheus, which they have pre∣served.</P><P>But the Love designed in our text is the one self-existent and infinite mind, whom if the generality of ancient mythologists have not intro∣duced or truly described in accounting for the production of the world and its appearances; yet, to a modern poet, it can be no objection that he hath ventured to differ from them in this particular; though, in other respects, he professeth to imitate their manner and conform to their opinions. For, in these great points of natural theology, they differ no less remarkably among themselves; and are perpetually con∣founding the philosophical relations of things with the traditionary circumstances of mythic history; upon which very account, Calsima∣chus, in his Hymn to Jupiter, declareth his dissent from them concern∣ing even an article of the national creed; adding, that the ancient bards were by no means to be depended on. And yet in the exordium of the old Argonautic poem, ascribed to Orpheus, it is said, that <Q>Love, whom mortals in later times call Phanes, was the father of the eternally begotten Night;</Q> who is generally represented, by these mythological poets, as being herself the parent of all things; and who, in the Indigitamenta, or Orphic Hymns, is said to be the same with Cy∣pris, or Love itself. Moreover, in the body of this Argonautic poem, where the personated Orpheus introduceth himself singing to his lyre in reply to Chiron, he celebrateth <Q>the obscure memory of Chaos, and the natures which it contained within itself in a state of perpe∣tual vicissitude; how the heaven had its boundary determined; the generation of the earth; the depth of the ocean; and also the sapient Love, the most ancient, the self-sufficient; with all the beings which he produced when he separated one thing from another</Q> Which no∣ble passage is more directly to Aristotle's purpose in the first book of his metaphysics than any of those which he has there quoted, to shew that the ancient poets and mythologists agreed with Empedocles, Anaxagoras and the other more sober philosophers, in that natural anticipation and common notion of mankind concerning the necessity of mind and reason to account for the connexion, motion, and good order of the world. For, though neither this poem, nor the hymns which pass under the same name, are, it should seem, the work of the real Orpheus; yet beyond all question they are very ancient. The hymns, more particularly, are allowed to be older than the invasion of Greece by Xerxes; and were probably a felt of public and solemn forms of devotion; as appears by a passage in one of them, which Demosthenes hath almost literally cited in his first oration against Aristogiton, as the saying of Orpheus, the founder of their most holy mysteries. On this account, they are of higher authority than any other mythological work now extant, the Theogony of Hesiod himself not excepted. The poetry of them is often extremely noble; and the mysterious air which prevails in them, together with its delightful impression upon the mind, cannot be better expressed than in that remarkable description with which they inspired the German edition Eschenbach, when he accidentally met with them at Leipsic: "Thesaurum me reperisse credidi," says he, <Q>&amp; prosecto thesaurum reperi. Incredibile dictu quo me sacro hor∣rore afflaverint indigitamenta ista deorum: nam et tempus ad illorum lectionem eligere cogebar, quod vel solum horrorem incutere animo potest, nocturnum; cum enim totam diem consumserim in contem∣plando urbis splendore, &amp; in adeundis, quibus scatet urbs illa, viris doctis; sola nox restabat, quam Orpheo consecrare potui. In abys∣sum quendam mysteriorum venerandae antiquitatis descendere vide∣bar, quotiescunque silente mundo, solis vigilantibus astris et luna, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> istos hymnos ad manus sumsi:</Q></P></NOTE> and Chaos <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Chaos.</HI>] The unformed, undigested mass of Moses and Plato; which Milton calls</P><P>"The womb of nature."</P></NOTE> Love, the sire of Fate<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>Love, the sire of Fate.</HI>] Fate is the universal system of natu∣ral causes; the work of the Omnipotent Mind, or of Love: so Minu∣dius Felix: <Q>Quid aliud est fatum, quam quod de unoquoque nostrum deus fatus est.</Q> So also Cicero, in The First Book on Divination: <Q>Fatum autem id appello, quod <HI>Graeci</HI> EIPMAPMENHN; id est, ordinem seriemque causarum, cum causa causae nexa rem ex se gignat—ex quo intelligitur, ut fatum sit non id quod superstitiose, sed id quod physice dicitur causa aeterna rerum.</Q> To the same purpose is the doc∣trine of Hierocles, in that excellent fragment concerning Providence and Destiny. As to the three Fates, or Destinies of the poets, they represented that part of the general system of natural causes which relates to man, and to other mortal beings: for so we are told in the hymn addressed to them among the Orphic Indigitamenta, where they are called the daughters of Night (or Love), and, contrary to the vul∣gar notion, are distinguished by the epithet of gentle, and tender∣hearted. According to Hesiod, Theog. ver. 904, they were the daugh∣ers of Jupiter and Themis; but in the Orphic Hymn to Venus, or Love, that Goddess is directly stiled the mother of Necessity, and is represented, immediately after, as governing the three Destinies, and conducting the whole system of natural causes.</NOTE>;</L>

Born of Fate was Time<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><HI>Born of Fate was Time.</HI>] Cronos, Saturn, or Time, was, ac∣cording to Apollodorus, the son of Coelum and Tellus. But the author of the hymns gives it quite undisguised by mythological language, and calls him plainly the offspring of the earth and the starry heaven; that is, of Fate, as explained in the preceding note.</NOTE>,</L>

Phurnutus, or Cor∣nutus, the author of a little Greek treatise on the nature of the gods, informs us, that by Jupiter was meant the vegetable soul of the world, which restrained and prevented those uncertain alterations which Saturn, or Time, used formerly to cause in the mundane system.</NOTE></L>

Tethys was the wife of the Ocean; Ops, or Rhea, the Earth; Vesta, the eldest daughter of Saturn, Fire; and the cloud-compeller, or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the Air; though he also represented the plastic principle of nature, as may be seen in the Orphic hymn inscribed to him.</NOTE></L>

Homer Odyss xiii. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Virgil, in the eighth book of the Aeneid, speaks as if the Nymphs, or Naiads, were the parents of the rivers, but in this he contradicts the testimony of Hesiod, and evidently departs from the orthodox system, which representeth several nymphs as retaining to every single river. On the other hand, Calimachus, who was very learned in all the school-divinity of those times, in his hymns to Delos, maketh Peneus, the great Thessalian river-god, the father of his nymphs: and Ovid, in the fourteenth book of his Metamorphoses, mentions the Naiads of Latium as the immediate daughters of the neighbouring river gods. Accordingly, the Naiads of particular rivers are occasio∣nally, both by Ovid and Statius, called by a patronymic, from the name of the river to which they belong.</NOTE>: Arethusa fair,</L>

Thymoetes had traveled over Libya to the country which borders on the western ocean; there he saw the island of Nysa, and learned from the inhabitants, that <Q>Ammon, king of Lybia, was married in former ages to Rhea, sister of Saturn and the Titans; that he afterwards fell in love with a beautiful virgin, whose name was Amalthea; had by her a son, and gave her pos∣ession of a neighbouring tract of land, wonderfully fertile; which in shape nearly resembling the horn of an ox, was thence called the Hesperian horn, and afterwards the horn of Amalthea; that, fearing the jealousy of Rhea, he concealed the young Bacchus, with his mother, in the island of Nysa;</Q> the beauty of which, Diodorus describes with great dignity and pomp of style. This fable is one of the noblest in all the ancient mythology, and seems to have made a particular impression on the imagination of Milton; the only modern poet (unless perhaps it be necessary to except Spenser) who, in these mysterious traditions of the poetic story, had a heart to feel, and words to express, the simple and solitary genius of antiquity. To raise the idea of his Paradise, he prefers it even to <Q><L>—"that Nysean isle</L><L>"Girt by the river Triton, where old Cham</L><L>"(Whom Gentiles Ammon call, and Libyan Jove)</L><L>"Hid Amalthea, and her florid son,</L><L>"Young Bacchus, from his stepdame Rhea's eye.</L></Q></NOTE> pours</L>

<L>When Aristides rul'd, and Cimon fought;</L>
<L>When all the generous fruits of Homer's page</L>
<L>Exulting Pindar<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Pindar was contemporary with Aristides and Cymon, in whom the glory of ancient Greece was at his height. When Xerxes invaded Greece, Pindar was true to the common interest of his country; though his fellow-citizens, the Thebans, had sold themselves to the Persian king. In one of his odes he expresses the great distress and anxiety of his mind, occasioned by the vast preparations of Xerxes against Greece. (Isthm, 8.) In another he celebrates the victories of Salamis, Plata, and Himera. (Pyth. 1.) It will be necessary to add two or three other particulars of his life, real or fabulous, in order to explain what follows in the next concerning him. First then, he was thought to be so great a favourite of Apollo, that the priests of that deity allotted him a constant share of their offerings. It was said of him, as of some other illustrious men, that at his birth a swarm of bees lighted on his lips, and fed him with their honey. It was also a tradition concerning him, that Pan was heard to recite his poetry, and seen dancing to one of his hymns on the mountains near Thebes. But a real historical fact in his life is, that the Thebans imposed a large fine upon him on account of the veneration which he expressed in his poems for that heroic spirit, shewn by the people of Athens in defence of the common liberty, which his own fellow-citizens had shamefully betrayed. And, as the argu∣ment of this ode implies, that <HI>great poetical talents, and high sentiments of liberty, do reciprocally produce and assist each other,</HI> so Pindar is perhaps the most exemplary proof of this connection, which occurs in history. The Thebans were remarkable, in general, for a slavish disposition through all the fortunes of their commonwealth; at the time of its ruin by Philip; and even in its best state, under the administration of Pelopidas and Epaminondas: and every one knows, they were no less remarkable for great dulness, and want of all genius. That Pindar should have equally distinguished himself from the rest of his fellow-citizens in both these respects seems somewhat extraordinary, and is scarce to be accounted for but by the preceding observation.</NOTE> saw to full perfection brought.</L>

<L>TO all inferior animals 'tis given</L>
<L>T' enjoy the state allotted them by Heaven;</L>
<L>No vain researches e'er disturb their rest,</L>
<L>No fears of dark futurity molest.</L>
<L>Man, only Man, solicitous to know</L>
<L>The springs whence Nature's operations flow,</L>
<L>Plods through a dreary waste with toil and pain,</L>
<L>And reasons, hopes, and thinks, and lives in vain;</L>
<L>For sable Death still hov'ring o'er his head,</L>
<L>Cuts short his progress, with his vital thread.</L>
<L>Wherefore, since Nature errs not, do we find</L>
<L>These seeds of Science in the human mind,</L>
<L>If no congenial fruits are predesign'd?</L>
<L><PB N="75" REF="77"/>For what avails to man this power to roam</L>
<L>Through ages past, and ages yet to come,</L>
<L>T' explore new worlds o'er all th' aetherial way,</L>
<L>Chain'd to a spot, and living but a day,</L>
<L>Since all must perish in one common grave,</L>
<L>Nor can these long laborious searches save?</L>
<L>Were it not wiser far, supinely laid,</L>
<L>To sport with Phyllis in the noontide shade?</L>
<L>Or at thy jovial festivals appear,</L>
<L>Great Bacchus, who alone the soul can clear</L>
<L>From all that it has felt, and all that it can fear?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Come on then, let us feast: let Chloe sing,</L>
<L>And soft Neaera touch the trembling string;</L>
<L>Enjoy the present hour, nor seek to know</L>
<L>What good or ill to-morrow may bestow.</L>
<L>But these delights soon pall upon the taste;</L>
<L>Let's try then if more serious cannot last:</L>
<L>Wealth let us heap on wealth, or fame pursue,</L>
<L>Let power and glory be our points in view;</L>
<L>In courts, in camps, in senates let us live,</L>
<L>Our levees crowded like the buzzing hive;</L>
<L>Each weak attempt the same sad lesson brings:</L>
<L>Alas, what vanity in human things!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What means then shall we try? where hope to find</L>
<L>A friendly harbour for the restless mind?</L>
<L>Who still, you see, impatient to obtain</L>
<L>Knowledge immense, (so Nature's laws ordain)</L>
<L><PB N="76" REF="78"/>Ev'n now, though fetter'd in corporeal clay,</L>

<L>No fleeting joys she asks, which must depend</L>
<L>On the frail senses, and with them must end;</L>
<L>But such as suit her own immortal fame,</L>

<L>Take courage then, these joys we shall attain:</L>
<L>Almighty Wisdom never acts in vain;</L>

<L>Such powers, e'er perish, like an earthly clod;</L>
<L>But purg'd at length from soul corruption's stain,</L>
<L>Freed from her prison, and unbound her chain,</L>
<L>She shall her native strength, and native skies regain:</L>
<L>To heav'n an old inhabitant return,</L>
<L>And draw nectareous streams from truth's perpetual urn.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whilst life remains (if life it can be call'd,</L>

<L>Tir'd with the dull pursuit of worldly things,</L>
<L>The soul scarce wakes, or opes her gladsome wings,</L>
<L>Yet still the godlike exile in disgrace</L>
<L>Retains some marks of her celestial race;</L>
<L>Else when from Mem'ry's store can she produce</L>
<L>Such various thoughts, or range them so for use?</L>
<L>Can matter these contain, dispose, apply?</L>
<L>Can in her cells such mighty treasures lie?</L>
<L>Or can her native force produce them to the eye?</L>

<L>Whence is this power, this foundress of all arts,</L>

<L>Breathes all pathetic, lovely, and sublime?</L>
<L>Whilst things on earth roll round from age to age,</L>
<L>The same dull farce repeated; on the stage</L>
<L>The poet gives us a creation new,</L>
<L>More pleasing, and more perfect than the true;</L>

<L>Could she thus act, unless some Power unknown,</L>

<L>Without the body's unrequested aid:</L>
<L>Her own internal strength her reason guides,</L>
<L>By this she now compares things, now divides;</L>
<L>Truth's scatter'd fragments piece by piece collects,</L>
<L>Rejoins, and thence her edifice erects;</L>
<L>Piles arts on arts, effects to causes ties,</L>
<L>And rears th' aspiring fabric to the skies:</L>
<L>From whence, as on a distant plain below,</L>
<L>She sees from causes consequences flow,</L>
<L>And the whole chain distinctly comprehends,</L>
<L>Which from th' Almighty's throne to earth descends:</L>
<L>And lastly, turning inwardly her eyes,</L>
<L>Perceives how all her own ideas rise,</L>
<L>Contemplates what she is, and whence she came,</L>
<L>And almost comprehends her own amazing frame.</L>
<L>Can mere machines be with such powers endued,</L>
<L>Or conscious of those powers, suppose they could?</L>

<LG>
<L>Th' <HI>Athenian</HI> sage, revolving in his mind</L>
<L>This weakness, blindness, madness of mankind,</L>
<L><PB N="84" REF="86"/>Foretold, that in maturer days, though late,</L>
<L>When time should ripen the decrees of Fate,</L>
<L>Some God would light us, like the rising day,</L>
<L>Through error's maze, and chase these clouds away.</L>
<L>Long since has time fulfill'd this great decree,</L>
<L>And brought us aid from this Divinity.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Well worth our search discoveries may be made</L>
<L>By Nature, void of the celestial aid:</L>
<L>Let's try what her conjectures then can reach;</L>
<L>Nor scorn plain Reason, when she deigns to teach.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That mind and body often sympathize</L>
<L>Is plain; such is this union Nature ties:</L>
<L>But then as often too they disagree;</L>
<L>Which proves the soul's superior progeny.</L>
<L>Sometimes the body in full strength we find,</L>
<L>Whilst various ails debilitate the mind;</L>
<L>At others, whilst the mind its force retains,</L>
<L>The body sinks with sickness and with pains:</L>
<L>Now did one common fate their beings end,</L>
<L>Alike they'd sicken, and alike they'd mend.</L>
<L>But sure experience, on the slightest view,</L>
<L>Shews us, that the reverse of this is true;</L>
<L>For when the body oft expiring lies,</L>
<L>Its limbs quite senseless, and half clos'd its eyes,</L>
<L>The mind new force and eloquence acquires,</L>
<L>And with prophetic voice the dying lips inspires,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Of like materials were they both compos'd,</L>
<L>How comes it, that the mind, when sleep has clos'd</L>
<L><PB N="85" REF="87"/>Each avenue of sense, expatiates wide,</L>
<L>Her liberty restor'd, her bonds unty'd?</L>
<L>And like some bird who from its prison flies,</L>
<L>Claps her exulting wings, and mounts the skies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Grant that corporeal is the human mind,</L>
<L>It must have parts <HI>in infinitum</HI> join'd;</L>
<L>And each of these must will, perceive, design,</L>
<L>And draw confus'dly in a different line;</L>
<L>Which then can claim dominion o'er the rest,</L>
<L>Or stamp the ruling passion in the breast?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Perhaps the mind is form'd by various arts</L>
<L>Of modelling, and figuring these parts;</L>
<L>Just as if circles wiser were than squares;</L>
<L>But surely common sense aloud declares</L>
<L>That site and figure are as foreign quite</L>
<L>From mental powers, as colours black or white.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Allow that motion is the cause of thought,</L>
<L>With what strange powers must motion then be fraught?</L>
<L>Reason, sense, science, must derive their source</L>
<L>From the wheel's rapid whirl, or pully's force;</L>
<L>Tops whipp'd by school-boys sages must commence,</L>
<L>Their hoops, like them, be cudgel'd into sense,</L>
<L>And boiling pots o'erflow with eloquence.</L>
<L>Whence can this very motion take its birth?</L>
<L>Not sure from matter, from dull clods of earth;</L>
<L>But from a living spirit lodg'd within,</L>
<L>Which governs all the bodily machine:</L>
<L><PB N="86" REF="88"/>Just as th' Almighty Universal Soul</L>
<L>Informs, directs, and animates the whole.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Cease then to wonder how th' immortal mind</L>
<L>Can live, when from the body quite disjoin'd;</L>
<L>But rather wonder, if she e'er could die,</L>
<L>So fram'd, so fashion'd for eternity;</L>
<L>Self-mov'd, not form'd of parts together ty'd,</L>
<L>Which time can dissipate, and force divide;</L>
<L>For beings of this make can never die,</L>
<L>Whose powers within themselves, and their own essence lie.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If to conceive how any thing can be</L>
<L>From shape abstracted and locality</L>
<L>Is hard; what think you of the Deity?</L>
<L>His Being not the least relation bears,</L>
<L>As far as to the human mind appears,</L>
<L>To shape, or size, similitude or place,</L>
<L>Cloath'd in no form, and bounded by no space.</L>
<L>Such then is God, a Spirit pure refin'd</L>
<L>From all material dross, and such the human mind.</L>
<L>For in what part of essence can we see</L>
<L>More certain marks of Immortality?</L>
<L>Ev'n from this dark confinement with delight</L>
<L>She looks abroad, and prunes herself for flight;</L>
<L>Like an unwilling inmate, longs to roam</L>
<L>From this dull earth, and seek her native home.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Go then, forgetful of its toil and strife,</L>
<L>Pursue the joys of this fallacious life;</L>
<L><PB N="87" REF="89"/>Like some poor fly, who lives but for a day,</L>
<L>Sip the fresh dews, and in the sunshine play,</L>
<L>And into nothing then dissolve away.</L>
<L>Are these our great pursuits? is this to live?</L>
<L>These all the hopes this much-lov'd world can give?</L>
<L>How much more worthy envy is their fate,</L>
<L>Who search for truth in a superior state!</L>
<L>Not groping step by step, as we pursue,</L>
<L>And following reason's much-entangled clue,</L>
<L>But with one great, and instantaneous view.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But how can sense remain, perhaps you'll say,</L>
<L>Corporeal organs if we take away,</L>
<L>Since it from them proceeds, and with them must decay?</L>
<L>Why not? or why may not the soul receive</L>
<L>New organs, since ev'n art can these retrieve?</L>
<L>The silver trumpet aids th' obstructed ear,</L>
<L>And optic glasses the dim eye can clear;</L>
<L>These in mankind new faculties create,</L>
<L>And lift him far above his native state;</L>
<L>Call down revolving planets from the sky,</L>
<L>Earth's secret treasures open to his eye,</L>
<L>The whole minute creation make his own▪</L>
<L>With all the wonders of a world unknown.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How could the mind, did she alone depend</L>
<L>On sense, the errors of those senses mend?</L>
<L>Yet oft' we see those senses she corrects,</L>
<L>And oft' their information quite rejects.</L>
<L><PB N="88" REF="90"/>In distances of things, their shapes and size,</L>
<L>Our reason judges better than our eyes.</L>
<L>Declares not this the soul's pre-eminence</L>
<L>Superior to, and quite distinct from sense?</L>
<L>For sure 'tis likely, that, since now so high</L>
<L>Clogg'd and unfledg'd she dares her wings to try,</L>
<L>Loos'd, and mature, she shall her strength display,</L>
<L>And soar at length to Truth's refulgent ray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Inquire you how these powers we shall attain?</L>
<L>'Tis not for us to know; our search is vain.</L>
<L>Can any now remember or relate</L>
<L>How he existed in the embryo state?</L>
<L>Or one from birth insensible of day</L>
<L>Conceive ideas of the solar ray?</L>
<L>That light's deny'd to him, which others see,</L>
<L>He knows, perhaps you'll say—and so do we.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The mind contemplative finds nothing here</L>
<L>On earth, that's worthy of a wish or fear:</L>
<L>He, whose sublime pursuit is God and truth,</L>
<L>Burns, like some absent and impatient youth,</L>

<L>But hold, presumptuous! charge not heav'n's decree</L>
<L>With such injustice, such partiality.</L>

<L>Or lose them in variety of pains!</L>

<L>(Those, still more numerous, I to name disdain,</L>
<L>By lewdness and intemperance justly slain!)</L>
<L><PB N="91" REF="93"/>What numbers, guiltless of their own disease,</L>
<L>Are snatch'd by sudden death, or waste by slow degrees!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where then is Virtue's well-deserv'd reward!—</L>
<L>Let's pay to Virtue every due regard:</L>
<L>That she enables man, let us confess,</L>
<L>To bear those evils, which she can't redress;</L>
<L>Gives hope, and conscious peace, and can assuage</L>
<L>Th' impetuous tempests both of lust and rage;</L>
<L>Yet she's a guard so far from being sure,</L>
<L>That oft her friends peculiar ills endure:</L>
<L>Where Vice prevails severest is their fate,</L>
<L>Tyrants pursue them with a three-fold hate.</L>
<L>How many, struggling in their country's cause,</L>
<L>And from their country meriting applause,</L>
<L>Have fall'n by wretches fond to be inslav'd,</L>
<L>And perish'd by the hands themselves had sav'd!</L>
</LG>
<LG>

<L>See knaves and fools united to pursue!</L>
<L>The man so form'd they all conspire to blame,</L>
<L>And Envy's pois'nous tooth attacks his fame;</L>
<L>Should he at length, so truly good and great,</L>
<L>Prevail, and rule with honest views the state,</L>
<L>Then must he toil for an ungrateful race,</L>
<L>Submit to clamor, libels, and disgrace;</L>
<L>Threaten'd, oppos'd, defeated in his ends,</L>
<L>By foes seditious, and aspiring friends.</L>
<L>Hear this, and tremble! all who would be great,</L>
<L>Yet know not what attends that dang'rous wretched state.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="92" REF="94"/>
<L>Is private life from all these evils free?</L>
<L>Vice of all kinds, rage, envy, there we see,</L>
<L>Deceit, that Friendship's mask insidious wears,</L>
<L>Quarrels and feuds, and law's intangling snares.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But there are pleasures still in human life,</L>
<L>Domestic ease, a tender loving wife,</L>
<L>Children, whose dawning smiles your heart engage,</L>
<L>The grace and comfort of soft-stealing age.</L>
<L>If happiness exists, 'tis surely here—</L>
<L>But are these joys exempt from care and fear?</L>
<L>Need I the miseries of that state declare,</L>

<L>Or say how hard those passions to discern,</L>
<L>Ere the dye's cast, and 'tis too late to learn?</L>
<L>Who can insure, that what is right, and good,</L>
<L>These children shall pursue? or, if they shou'd,</L>

<L>We say not, that these ills from virtue flow:</L>

<L>The golden ages would again begin,</L>
<L>But 'tis our lot in this to suffer, and to sin.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Observing this, some sages have decreed</L>
<L>That all things from two causes must proceed:</L>
<L>Two principles with equal power endued,</L>
<L>This wholly evil, that supremely good.</L>
<L>From this arise the miseries we endure,</L>
<L>Whilst that administers a friendly cure.</L>
<L><PB N="93" REF="95"/>Hence life is chequer'd still with bliss and woe;</L>

<L>Can such a system satisfy the mind?</L>
<L>Are both these Gods in equal power conjoin'd,</L>
<L>Or one superior? Equal if you say,</L>

<L>Himself half-starving happier far than kings.</L>
<L>'Tis fine indeed to be so wond'rous wise!</L>
<L>By the same reas'ning too he pain denies;</L>

<L>Pain's not an ill, he utters with a groan;</L>
<L>What then? an inconvenience 'tis, he'll own.</L>
<L>What vigour, health, and beauty? are these good?</L>
<L>No: they may be accepted, not pursued:</L>

<L>But is it right, what here so oft appears,</L>

<L>If every rule of equity demands,</L>
<L>That Vice and Virtue from th' Almighty's hands</L>
<L>Should due rewards and punishments receive,</L>

<HEAD>THE ARBOUR: AN ODE TO CONTENTMENT.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. THOMAS COLE<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Of Queen's College, Cambridge.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>TO these lone shades, where Peace delights to dwell,</L>
<L>May Fortune oft permit me to retreat:</L>
<L>Here bid the world, with all its cares, farewel,</L>
<L>And leave its pleasures to the rich and great.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oft as the summer's sun shall cheer this scene</L>
<L>With that mild gleam which points his parting ray,</L>
<L>Here let my soul enjoy each eve serene,</L>
<L>Here share its calm, 'till life's declining day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No gladsome image then should 'scape my sight,</L>
<L>From these gay flowers, which border near my eye,</L>
<L>To yon bright cloud, that decks, with richest light,</L>
<L>The gilded mantle of the western sky.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With ample gaze I'd trace that ridge remote,</L>
<L>Where opening cliffs disclose the boundless main;</L>
<L>With earnest ken from each low hamlet note</L>
<L>The steeple's summit peeping o'er the plain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What various works that rural landscape fill,</L>
<L>Where mingling hedge-rows beauteous fields inclose;</L>
<L>And prudent Culture, with industrious skill,</L>
<L>Her chequer'd scene of crops and fallows shows!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="106" REF="108"/>
<L>How should I love to mark that riv'let's maze,</L>
<L>Through which it works its untaught course along;</L>
<L>Whilst near its grassy banks the herd shall graze,</L>
<L>And blithsome milkmaid chaunt her thoughtless song!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Still would I note the shades of length'ning sheep,</L>
<L>As scatter'd o'er the hill's slant brow they rove;</L>
<L>Still note the day's last glimm'ring lustre creep</L>
<L>From off the verge of yonder upland grove.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor should my leisure seldom wait to view</L>
<L>The slow-wing'd rooks in homeward train succeed;</L>
<L>Nor yet forbear the swallow to pursue,</L>
<L>With quicker glance, close skimming o'er the mead.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But mostly here should I delight t' explore</L>
<L>The bounteous laws of Nature's mystic power;</L>
<L>Then muse on Him who blesseth all her store,</L>
<L>And give to solemn thoughts the sober hour.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let mirth unenvy'd laugh with proud disdain,</L>
<L>And deem it spleen one moment thus to waste;</L>
<L>If so she keep far hence her noisy train,</L>
<L>Nor interrupt those joys she cannot taste.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Far sweeter streams shall flow from Wisdom's spring,</L>
<L>Than she receives from Folly's costliest bowl;</L>
<L>And what delights can her chief dainties bring,</L>
<L>Like those which feast the heavenly-pensive soul?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="107" REF="109"/>
<L>Hail, Silence, then! be thou my frequent guest;</L>
<L>For thou art wont my gratitude to raise,</L>
<L>As high as wonder can the theme suggest,</L>
<L>Whene'er I meditate my Maker's praise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What joy for tutor'd Piety to learn</L>
<L>All that my Christian solitude can teach,</L>
<L>Where weak-ey'd Reason's self may well discern</L>
<L>Each clearer truth the gospel deigns to preach?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No object here but may convince the mind</L>
<L>Of more than thoughtful honesty shall need;</L>
<L>Nor can Suspense long question here to find</L>
<L>Sufficient evidence to fix its creed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis God that gives this bower its aweful gloom;</L>
<L>His arched verdure does its roof invest;</L>
<L>He breathes the life of fragrance on its bloom;</L>
<L>And with his kindness makes its owner blest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh, may the guidance of thy grace attend</L>
<L>The use of all thy bounty shall bestow;</L>
<L>Lest folly should mistake its sacred end,</L>
<L>Or vice convert it into means of woe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Incline and aid me still my life to steer,</L>
<L>As conscience dictates what to shun or chuse;</L>
<L>Nor let my heart feel anxious hope or fear,</L>
<L>For aught this world can give me or refuse.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="108" REF="110"/>
<L>Then shall not wealth's parade one wish excite,</L>
<L>For wretched state to barter peace away;</L>
<L>Nor vain ambition's lure my pride invite,</L>
<L>Beyond Contentment's humble path to stray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What though thy wisdom may my lot deny,</L>
<L>The treasur'd plenty freely to dispense;</L>
<L>Yet well thy goodness can that want supply</L>
<L>With larger portions of benevolence.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And sure the heart that wills the gen'rous deed</L>
<L>May all the joys of Charity command;</L>
<L>For she best loves from notice to recede,</L>
<L>And deals her unsought gifts with secret hand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then will I sometimes bid my fancy steal</L>
<L>That unclaim'd wealth no property restrains;</L>
<L>Soothe with fictitious aid my friendly zeal,</L>
<L>And realize each godly act she feigns.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So shall I gain the gold without alloy;</L>
<L>Without oppression, toil, or treach'rous snares;</L>
<L>So shall I know its use, its power employ,</L>
<L>And yet avoid its dangers and its cares.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And, spite of all that boastful wealth can do,</L>
<L>In vain would Fortune strive the rich to bless,</L>
<L>Were they not flatter'd with some distant view</L>
<L>Of what she ne'er can give them to possess.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="109" REF="111"/>
<L>E'en Wisdom's high conceit great wants would feel,</L>
<L>If not supply'd from Fancy's boundless store;</L>
<L>And nought but shame makes power itself conceal,</L>
<L>That she, to satisfy, must promise more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But though experience will not fail to show,</L>
<L>Howe'er its truth man's weakness may upbraid,</L>
<L>That what he mostly values here below,</L>
<L>Owes half its relish to kind Fancy's aid;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet should not Prudence her light wing command,</L>
<L>She may too far extend her heedless flight;</L>
<L>For Pleasure soon shall quit her fairy-land</L>
<L>If Nature's regions are not held in sight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From Truth's abode, in search of kind deceit,</L>
<L>Within due limits she may safely roam;</L>
<L>If roving does not make her hate retreat,</L>
<L>And with aversion shun her proper home.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But thanks to those, whose fond parental care</L>
<L>To Learning's paths my youthful steps confin'd,</L>
<L>I need not shun a state which lets me share</L>
<L>Each calm delight that soothes the studious mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While genius lasts, <HI>his</HI> fame shall ne'er decay,</L>
<L>Whose artful hand first caus'd its fruits to spread;</L>
<L>In lasting volumes stampt the printed lay,</L>
<L>And taught the Muses to embalm the dead.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="110" REF="112"/>
<L>To him I owe each fair instructive page,</L>
<L>Where Science tells me what her sons have known;</L>
<L>Collects their choicest works from every age,</L>
<L>And makes me wise with knowledge not my own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Books rightly us'd may every state secure,</L>
<L>From fortune's evils may our peace defend;</L>
<L>May teach us how to shun, or to endure,</L>
<L>The foe malignant, and the faithless friend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Should rigid Want withdraw all outward aid,</L>
<L>Kind stores of inward comfort they can bring;</L>
<L>Should keen Disease life's tainted stream invade,</L>
<L>Sweet to the soul from them pure health may spring.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Should both at once man's weakly frame infest,</L>
<L>Some letter'd charm may still relief supply;</L>
<L>'Gainst all events prepare his patient breast,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>For though no words can time or fate restrain;</L>
<L>No sounds suppress the call of Nature's voice;</L>
<L>Though neither rhymes, nor spells, can conquer pain,</L>
<L>Nor magic's self make wretchedness our choice;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet reason, while it forms the subtile plan,</L>
<L>Some purer source of pleasure to explore,</L>
<L>Must deem it vain for that poor pilgrim, man,</L>

<HEAD>The DROPSICAL MAN.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By Mr. TAYLOR.</BYLINE>
<L>A JOLLY, brave toper, who could not forbear,</L>
<L>Though his life was in danger, old port and stale beer,</L>
<L>Gave the doctors the hearing—but still would drink on,</L>
<L>'Till the dropsy had swell'd him as big as a ton.</L>
<L>The more he took physic the worse still he grew,</L>
<L>And tapping was now the last thing he could do.</L>
<L>Affairs at this crisis, and doctors come down,</L>
<L>He began to consider—so sent for his son.</L>
<L>Tom, see by what courses I've shorten'd my life,</L>
<L>I'm leaving the world ere I'm forty and five;</L>
<L>More than probable 'tis, that in twenty-four hours,</L>
<L>This manor, this house, and estate will be yours;</L>
<L>My early excesses may teach you this truth,</L>
<L>That 'tis working for death to drink hard in one's youth.</L>
<L>Says Tom (who's a lad of a generous spirit,</L>
<L>And not like young rakes, who're in haste to inherit):</L>
<L>Sir, don't be dishearten'd; although it be true,</L>
<L>Th' operation is painful, and hazardous too,</L>
<L>'Tis no more than what many a man has gone thro'.</L>
<L>And then, as for years, you may yet be call'd young,</L>
<L>Your life after this may be happy and long.</L>
<L>Don't flatter me, Tom, was the father's reply,</L>
<L>With a jest in his mouth, and a tear in his eye:</L>
<L>Too well by experience, my vessels, thou know'st,</L>
<L>No sooner are tapp'd, but they give up the ghost.</L>

</EPIGRAPH>
<BYLINE>By the Hon. Mr. DODINGTON, afterwards Lord MELCOMBE.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>THO' strength of genius, by experience taught,</L>
<L>Gives thee to sound the depth of human thought,</L>
<L>To trace the various workings of the mind,</L>
<L>And rule the secret springs that rule mankind;</L>
<L>Rare gift! yet, Walpole, wilt thou condescend</L>
<L>To listen, if thy unexperienc'd friend</L>
<L>Can aught of use impart, though void of skill,</L>
<L>And raise attention by sincere good will:</L>
<L><PB N="144" REF="146"/>For friendship sometimes want of parts supplies,</L>
<L>The heart may furnish what the head denies.</L>
<L>As, when the rapid Rhine o'er swelling tides,</L>
<L>To grace old Ocean's coast, in triumph rides,</L>
<L>Though rich in source, he drains a thousand springs,</L>
<L>Nor scorns the tribute each small riv'let brings:</L>
<L>So thou shalt hence absorb each feeble ray,</L>
<L>Each dawn of meaning in thy brighter day;</L>
<L>Shalt like, or, where thou canst not like, excuse,</L>
<L>Since no mean interest shall prophane the Muse;</L>
<L>No malice wrapt in truth's disguise offend,</L>
<L>No flattery taint the freedom of a friend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When first a generous mind surveys the great,</L>
<L>And views the crowds that on their fortune wait,</L>
<L>Pleas'd with the shew, (though little understood,)</L>
<L>He only seeks the power, to do the good:</L>
<L>Thinks, till he tries, 'tis godlike to dispose,</L>
<L>And gratitude still springs, when bounty flows;</L>
<L>That every grant sincere affection wins,</L>
<L>And where our wants have end, our love begins.</L>
<L>But they who long the paths of state have trod,</L>
<L>Learn from the clamours of the murm'ring crowd,</L>
<L>Which cramm'd, yet craving, still their gates besiege,</L>
<L>'Tis easier far to give, than to oblige.</L>
<L>This of thy conduct seems the nicest part.</L>
<L>The chief perfection of the statesman's art,</L>
<L>To give to fair assent a fairer face,</L>
<L>Or foften a refusal into grace.</L>
<L><PB N="145" REF="147"/>But few there are, that can be freely kind,</L>
<L>Or know to fix the favours on the mind;</L>
<L>Hence some whene'er they would oblige, offend,</L>
<L>And while they make the fortune lose the friend:</L>
<L>Still give unthank'd; still squander, not bestow;</L>
<L>For great men want not what to give, but how.</L>
<L>The race of men that follow courts, 'tis true,</L>
<L>Think all they get, and more than all, their due;</L>
<L>Still ask, but ne'er consult their own deserts,</L>
<L>And measure by their interest, not their parts.</L>
<L>From this mistake so many men we see</L>
<L>But ill become the thing they wish to be:</L>
<L>Hence discontent and fresh demands arise,</L>
<L>More power, more favour in the great man's eyes:</L>
<L>All feel a want, though none the cause suspects,</L>
<L>But hate their patron for their own defects.</L>
<L>Such none can please, but who reforms their hearts,</L>
<L>And when he gives them places, gives them parts.</L>
<L>As these o'erprize their worth, so sure the great</L>
<L>May sell their favours at too dear a rate.</L>
<L>When merit pines while clamour is preferr'd,</L>
<L>And long attachment waits among the herd;</L>
<L>When no distinction, where distinction's due,</L>
<L>Marks from the many the superior few:</L>
<L>When strong cabal constrains them to be just,</L>
<L>And makes them give at last, because they must;</L>
<L>What hopes that men of real worth should prize</L>
<L>What neither friendship gives, nor merit buys?</L>
<L><PB N="146" REF="148"/>The man who justly o'er the whole presides,</L>
<L>His well-weigh'd choice with wise affection guides;</L>
<L>Knows when to stop with grace, and when advance,</L>
<L>Nor gives from importunity, or chance:</L>
<L>But thinks how little gratitude is ow'd,</L>
<L>When favours are extorted, not bestow'd.</L>
<L>When safe on shore ourselves, we see the crowd</L>
<L>Surround the great, importunate and loud:</L>
<L>Through such a tumult 'tis no easy task</L>
<L>To drive the man of real worth to ask;</L>
<L>Surrounded thus, and giddy with the shew,</L>
<L>'Tis hard for great men rightly to bestow;</L>
<L>From hence so few are skill'd in either case,</L>
<L>To ask with dignity, or give with grace.</L>
<L>Sometimes the great, seduc'd by love of parts,</L>
<L>Consult our genius, but neglect our hearts;</L>
<L>Pleas'd with the glittering sparks that genius flings,</L>
<L>They lift us tow'ring on the eagle's wings;</L>
<L>Mark out the flights by which themselves begun,</L>
<L>And teach our dazzled eyes to bear the sun,</L>
<L>Till we forget the hand that made us great,</L>
<L>And grow to envy, not to emulate.</L>
<L>To emulate a generous warmth implies,</L>
<L>To reach the virtues that make great men rise;</L>
<L>But envy wears a mean malignant face,</L>
<L>And aims not at their virtues, but their place.</L>
<L>Such to oblige, how vain is the pretence!</L>
<L>When every favour is a fresh offence,</L>
<L><PB N="147" REF="149"/>By which superior power is still imply'd,</L>
<L>And while it helps the fortune, hurts the pride.</L>
<L>Slight is the hate neglect or hardships breed;</L>
<L>But those who hate from envy, hate indeed.</L>
<L>Since so perplex'd the choice, whom shall we trust?</L>
<L>Methinks, I hear thee cry, the brave, the just:</L>
<L>The man by no mean fears or hopes controul'd,</L>
<L>Who serves thee from affection, not for gold!</L>
<L>We love the honest, and esteem the brave,</L>
<L>Despise the coxcomb, but detest the knave.</L>
<L>No shew of parts the truly wise seduce,</L>
<L>To think that knaves can be of real use.</L>
<L>The man who contradicts the public voice,</L>
<L>And strives to dignify a worthless choice,</L>
<L>Attempts a task that on the choice reflects,</L>
<L>And lends us light to point out new defects.</L>
<L>One worthless man that gains what he pretends,</L>
<L>Disgusts a thousand unpretending friends:</L>
<L>And since no art can make a counter pass,</L>
<L>Or add the weight of gold to mimic brass,</L>
<L>When princes to bad ore their image join,</L>
<L>They more debase the stamp than raise the coin.</L>
<L>Be thine that care, true merit to reward,</L>
<L>And gain that good; nor will the task be hard.</L>
<L>Souls found alike so quick by nature blend,</L>
<L>An honest man is more than half thy friend:</L>
<L>Him no mere views, no haste to rise, shall sway,</L>
<L>Thy choice to sully, or thy trust betray.</L>
<L><PB N="148" REF="150"/>Ambition here shall at due distance stand;</L>
<L>Nor is wit dangerous in an honest hand:</L>
<L>Besides, if failings at the bottom lie,</L>
<L>He views those failings with a lover's eye.</L>
<L>Though small his genius, let him do his best,</L>
<L>Our wishes and belief supply the rest:</L>
<L>Let others barter servile faith for gold,</L>
<L>His friendship is not to be bought or sold.</L>
<L>Fierce opposition he unmov'd shall face,</L>
<L>Modest in favour, daring in disgrace:</L>
<L>To share thy adverse fate alone pretend,</L>
<L>In power a servant, out of power a friend.</L>
<L>Here pour thy favours in an ample flood,</L>
<L>Indulge thy boundless thirst of doing good.</L>
<L>Nor think that good alone to him confin'd;</L>
<L>Such to oblige is to oblige mankind.</L>
<L>If thus thy mighty master's steps thou trace,</L>
<L>The brave to cherish, and the good to grace,</L>
<L>Long shalt thou stand from rage and faction free,</L>
<L>And teach us long to love the king and thee;</L>
<L>Or fall a victim dangerous to the foe,</L>
<L>And make him tremble when he strikes the blow;</L>
<L>While honour, gratitude, affection join,</L>
<L>To deck thy close, and brighten thy decline.</L>
<L>Illustrious doom! the great when thus displac'd,</L>
<L>With friendship guarded, and with virtue grac'd,</L>
<L>In aweful ruin, like Rome's senate, fall</L>
<L>The prey and worship of the wond'ring Gaul.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="149" REF="151"/>
<L>No doubt to genius some reward is due</L>
<L>(Excluding that were satirizing you):</L>
<L>But yet believe thy undesigning friend;</L>
<L>When truth and genius for thy choice contend,</L>
<L>Though both have weight, when in the balance cast,</L>
<L>Let probity be first, and parts the last.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>On these foundations if thou dar'st be great,</L>
<L>And check the growth of folly and deceit,</L>
<L>When party rage shall drop through length of days,</L>
<L>And calumny be ripen'd into praise,</L>
<L>Then future times shall to thy worth allow</L>
<L>That fame, which envy would call flattery now,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus far my zeal, though for the task unfit,</L>
<L>Has pointed out the rocks where others split:</L>
<L>By that inspir'd, though stranger to the Nine,</L>
<L>And negligent of any fame but thine,</L>
<L>I take that friendly, but superfluous part,</L>
<L>That acts from nature what I teach from art.</L>

<HEAD>To the Worthy, Humane, Generous, Reverend, and Noble, Mr. FREDERICK CORNWALLIS, now Archbishop of CANTERBURY.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By Dr. SNEYD DAVIES. Written in the Year 1743.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>IN frolic's hour, ere serious thought had birth,</L>
<L>There was a time, my dear Cornwallis, when</L>
<L>Fancy would take me on her airy wing</L>
<L>And waft to views romantic; there display</L>
<L>Some motley vision, shade and sun: the cliff,</L>
<L>O'erhanging sparkling brooks and ruins grey,</L>
<L>Bade me meanders trace, and catch the form</L>
<L>Of varying clouds, and rainbows learn to paint.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sometimes ambition, brushing by, would twitch</L>
<L>My spirits, and with winning look sublime</L>
<L>Allure to follow. What though steep the track,</L>
<L>Her mountain's top would overpay, when climb'd,</L>
<L>The scaler's toil; her temple there was fine,</L>
<L>And lovely thence the prospects. She could tell</L>
<L>Where laurels grew, whence many a wreath antique;</L>
<L>But more advis'd to shun the barren twig,</L>
<L>(What is immortal verdure without fruit?)</L>
<L><PB N="154" REF="156"/>And woo some thriving art: her num'rous mines</L>
<L>Were open to the searcher's skill and pains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Caught by th' harangue, heart beat, and flutt'ring pulse,</L>
<L>Sounded irregular marches, to be gone—</L>
<L>What, pause a moment when Ambition calls!</L>
<L>No, the blood gallops to the distant goal,</L>
<L>And throbs to reach it. Let the lame sit still.</L>
<L>When Fortune gentle, at the hill's verge extreme,</L>
<L>Array'd in decent robe, and plain attire,</L>
<L>Smiling approach'd; and what occasion ask'd</L>
<L>Of climbing? She already provident</L>
<L>Had cater'd well, if stomach could digest</L>
<L>Her viands, and a palate not too nice.</L>
<L>Unfit she said, for perilous attempt,</L>
<L>That manly limb requir'd, and sinews tough.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She took, and lay'd me in a vale remote,</L>
<L>Amid the gloomy scene of fir and yew,</L>
<L>On apple ground; where Morpheus strew'd the bed:</L>
<L>Obscurity her curtain round me drew,</L>
<L>And syren Sloth a dull quietus sung.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sithence no fairy sights, no quick'ning ray,</L>
<L>No stir of pulse, nor objects to entice</L>
<L>Abroad the spirits; but the cloyster'd heart</L>
<L>Sits squat at home, like pagod in a nitch</L>
<L>Demure; or grandees with nod-watching eye,</L>
<L>And folded arms, in presence of the throne,</L>
<L>Turk, or Indostan—Cities, forums, courts,</L>
<L><PB N="155" REF="157"/>And prating sanhedrims, and drumming wars,</L>
<L>Affect no more than stories told to bed</L>
<L>Lethargic, which at intervals the sick</L>
<L>Hears and forgets, and wakes to doze again.</L>
<L>Instead of converse and variety,</L>
<L>The same trite round, the same stale silent scene:</L>
<L>Such are thy comforts, blessed Solitude!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But Innocence is there, but Peace all kind,</L>
<L>And simple Quiet with her downy couch,</L>
<L>Meads lowing, tune of birds, and lapse of streams;</L>
<L>And Saunter with a book; and warbling Muse,</L>
<L>In praise of hawthorns.—Life's whole business this!</L>
<L>Is it to bask i' th' sun? if so, a snail</L>
<L>Were happy crawling on a southern wall.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Why sits Content upon a cottage sill</L>
<L>At even-tide; and blesseth the coarse meal</L>
<L>In sooty corner? why sweet slumbers wait</L>
<L>Th' hard pallet? not because from haunt remote,</L>
<L>Sequester'd in a dingle's bushy lap:</L>
<L>'Tis labour makes the peasant's sav'ry fare,</L>
<L>And works out his repose: for ease must ask</L>
<L>The leave of diligence to be enjoy'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh! listen not to that enchantress Ease</L>
<L>With seeming smile; her palatable cup</L>
<L>By standing grows insipid; and beware</L>
<L>Perdition, for there's poison in the lees.</L>
<L>What health impair'd, and crowds inactive maim'd!</L>
<L>What daily martyrs to her sluggish cause!</L>
<L><PB N="156" REF="158"/>Less strict devoir the Russ and Persian claim</L>
<L>Despotic; and, as subjects long inur'd</L>

<L>So fares it with our sov'reign, and her train.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What tho' with lure fallacious she pretend</L>
<L>From worldly bondage to set free; what gain</L>
<L>Her votaries? What avails from iron chains</L>
<L>Exempt, if rosy fetters bind as fast?</L>

<LG>
<L>Bestir, and answer your creation's end.</L>
<L>Think we that man with vig'rous pow'r endow'd,</L>

<L>Sluggards are Nature's rebels, slight her laws,</L>
<L>Nor live up to the terms on which they hold</L>
<L>Their vital lease. Laborious terms and hard!</L>
<L>But such the tenure of our earthly state!</L>
<L>Riches and fame are Industry's reward;</L>
<L>The nimble runner courses Fortune down,</L>
<L>And then he banquets, for she feeds the bold.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Think what you owe your country, what yourself.</L>
<L>If splendor charm not, yet avoid the scorn</L>
<L>That treads on lowly stations. Think of some</L>
<L>Affiduous booby mounting o'er your head,</L>
<L>And thence with saucy grandeur looking down:</L>
<L>Think of (Reflection's stab!) the pitying friend</L>
<L>With shoulder shrugg'd, and sorry. Think that Time</L>
<L>Has golden minutes, if discreetly seiz'd:</L>
<L>And if some sad example, indolent,</L>
<L>To warn and scare be wanting—think of me.</L>

<L>IN the dead of the night, when with labour oppress'd</L>
<L>All mortals enjoy the calm blessing of rest,</L>
<L>Cupid knock'd at my door; I awoke with a noise,</L>
<L>And "who is it (I call'd) that my sleep thus destroys?"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"You need not be frighten'd, he answered mild,</L>

<L>"And my way I have lost; and do, pray, let me in."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I was mov'd with compassion; and striking a light,</L>
<L>I open'd the door; when a boy stood in sight,</L>

<L>With a bow and with arrows too he was equipp'd.</L>

<L>I set him down by me: with napkins I dried,</L>
<L>I chaf'd him all over, kept out the cold air,</L>
<L>And I wrung with my hands the wet out of his hair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He from wet and from cold was no sooner at ease,</L>
<L>But taking his bow up, he said, "If you please</L>
<L>"We will try it; I would by experiment know</L>
<L>"If the wet hath not damag'd the string of my bow."</L>
</LG>

<PB N="173" REF="175"/>
<L>Forthwith from his quiver an arrow he drew,</L>

<LG>
<L>WHILE you, my dear girls, in your paradise stray,</L>
<L>Diverting with innocent freedom the day,</L>
<L>I wander alone in a barbarous land,</L>
<L>Half bak'd by the sun, half blind by the sand.</L>
<L>Then your wood too and grotto so swim in my sight,</L>
<L>They give me no respite by day nor by night;</L>
<L>No sooner asleep but I'm dreaming of you;</L>
<L>I am just wak'd from one,—would to God it were true.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Methought I was now a fine gentleman grown,</L>
<L>And had got, Lord knows how, an estate of my own.</L>
<L>Good-bye to plain Tom, I was rais'd a peg higher;</L>
<L>Some call'd me his worship, and others the squire.</L>
<L>'Twas a place, I remember, exactly like Easton,</L>
<L>A scene for an emperor's fancy to feast on.</L>
<L>There I built a fine house with great cost and great care,</L>
<L>(Your la'ships have form'd many such in the air)</L>
<L>Not of stucco, nor brick, but as good Portland stone</L>
<L>As Kent <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The painter and architect.</NOTE> would desire to be working upon.</L>
<L><PB N="189" REF="191"/>The apartments not small, nor monstrously great,</L>
<L>But chiefly for use, and a little for state;</L>
<L>So begilt, and becarv'd, and with ornaments grac'd,</L>
<L>That every one said, I'd an excellent taste.</L>
<L>Here I liv'd like a king, never hoarded my pelf,</L>
<L>Kept a coach for my sisters, a nag for myself,</L>
<L>With something that's good when our Highclear friends come,</L>
<L>And, spite of 'squire Herbert, a fire in each room.</L>
<L>A canal made for profit as well as for pleasure,</L>
<L>That's about, let me see, two acres in measure;</L>
<L>Both the eye to delight, and the table to crown,</L>
<L>With a jack, or a perch, when my uncles come down.</L>
<L>An exceeding great wood, that's been set a great while,</L>
<L>In length near a league, and in breadth near a mile.</L>
<L>There every dear girl her bright genius displays,</L>
<L>In a thousand fine whimsies a thousand fine ways.</L>
<L>O how charming the walks to my fancy appear!</L>
<L>What a number of temples and grottos are here!</L>
<L>My soul was transported to such an extreme,</L>
<L>That I leap'd up in raptures,—when lo! 'twas a dream.</L>
<L>Then vexing I chid the impertinent day</L>
<L>For driving so sweet a delusion away.</L>
<L>Thus spectres arise, as by nurse-maids we're told,</L>
<L>And hie to the place where they buried their gold:</L>
<L>There hov'ring around until morning remain;</L>
<L>Then sadly return to their torments again.</L>

<L>The charming things that Molly said,</L>

<L>His worth no mortal dares dispute:</L>
<L>Then he's your brother too to boot.</L>
</LG>

<L>At this she made a moment's pause,</L>
<L>Then with a sigh resum'd the cause.</L>
<L>Alas! my dears, you little know</L>
<L>A sailor's toil, a trav'ler's woe;</L>
<L>Perhaps this very hour he strays</L>
<L>A lonely wretch through desart ways;</L>
<L>Or shipwreck'd on a foreign strand,</L>

<L>The other left the room outright;</L>

<LG>
<L>IN Russia's frozen clime some ages since</L>
<L>There dwelt, historians say, a worthy prince,</L>
<L>Who to his people's good confin'd his care,</L>
<L>And fix'd the basis of his empire there;</L>
<L>Inlarg'd their trade, the lib'ral arts improv'd,</L>
<L>Made nations happy, and himself belov'd;</L>
<L>To all the neighb'ring states a terror grown,</L>
<L>The dear delight, and glory of his own.</L>
<L>Not like those kings, who vainly seek renown,</L>
<L>From countries ruin'd, and from battles won;</L>
<L>Those mighty Nimrods, who mean laws despise,</L>
<L>Call murder but a princely exercise,</L>
<L>And, if one bloodless sun should steal away,</L>
<L>Cry out with Titus, they have lost a day;</L>
<L><PB N="195" REF="197"/>Who, to be more than men, themselves debase</L>
<L>Beneath the brute, their Maker's form deface,</L>
<L>Raising their titles by their God's disgrace.</L>
<L>Like fame to bold Erostratus we give,</L>
<L>Who scorn'd by less than sacrilege to live;</L>
<L>On holy ruins rais'd a lasting name,</L>
<L>And in the temple's fire diffus'd his shame.</L>
<L>Far diff'rent praises, and a brighter fame,</L>
<L>The virtues of the young Porsenna claim;</L>
<L>For by that name the Russian king was known,</L>
<L>And sure a nobler ne'er adorn'd the throne.</L>
<L>In war he knew the deathful sword to wield,</L>
<L>And sought the thickest dangers of the field,</L>
<L>A bold commander; but, the storm o'erblown,</L>
<L>He seem'd as he were made for peace alone;</L>
<L>Then was the golden age again restor'd,</L>
<L>Nor less his justice honour'd than his sword.</L>
<L>All needless pomp, and outward grandeur spar'd,</L>
<L>The deeds that grac'd him were his only guard;</L>
<L>No private views beneath a borrow'd name;</L>
<L>His and the public interest were the same.</L>
<L>In wealth and pleasure let the subject live,</L>
<L>But virtue is the king's prerogative;</L>
<L>Porsenna there without a rival stood,</L>
<L>And would maintain his right of doing good.</L>
<L>Nor did his person less attraction wear,</L>
<L>Such majesty and sweetness mingled there;</L>
<L><PB N="196" REF="198"/>Heav'n with uncommon art the clay refin'd,</L>
<L>A proper mansion for so fair a mind;</L>
<L>Each look, each action bore peculiar grace,</L>
<L>And love itself was painted on his face.</L>
<L>In peaceful time he suffer'd not his mind</L>
<L>To rust in sloth, though much to peace inclin'd;</L>
<L>Nor wanton in the lap of pleasure lay,</L>
<L>And, lost to glory, loiter'd life away:</L>
<L>But active rising ere the prime of day,</L>
<L>Through woods and lonely desarts lov'd to stray;</L>
<L>With hounds and horns to wake the furious bear,</L>
<L>Or rouze the tawny lion from his laire;</L>
<L>To rid the forest of the savage brood,</L>
<L>And whet his courage for his country's good.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>One day, as he pursued the dang'rous sport,</L>
<L>Attended by the nobles of his court,</L>
<L>It chanc'd a beast of more than common speed</L>
<L>Sprang from the brake, and through the desart fled.</L>
<L>The ardent prince, impetuous as the wind,</L>
<L>Rush'd on, and left his lagging train behind.</L>
<L>Fir'd with the chace, and full of youthful blood,</L>
<L>O'er plains, and vales, and woodland wilds he rode,</L>
<L>Urging his courser's speed, nor thought the day</L>
<L>How wasted, nor how intricate the way;</L>
<L>Nor, 'till the night in dusky clouds came on,</L>
<L>Restrain'd his pace, or found himself alone.</L>
<L>Missing his train, he strove to measure back</L>
<L>The road he came, but could not find the track;</L>
<L><PB N="197" REF="199"/>Still turning to the place he left before,</L>
<L>And only lab'ring to be lost the more.</L>
<L>The bugle horn, which o'er his shoulders hung,</L>
<L>So loud he winded, that the forest rung;</L>
<L>In vain, no voice but Echo from the ground,</L>
<L>And vocal woods make mock'ry of the sound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now the gath'ring clouds began to spread</L>
<L>O'er the dun face of night a deeper shade;</L>
<L>And the hoarse thunder, growling from afar,</L>
<L>With herald voice proclaim'd th' approaching war;</L>
<L>Silence awhile ensu'd,—then by degrees</L>
<L>A hollow wind came mutt'ring through the trees.</L>
<L>Sudden the full-fraught sky discharg'd its store,</L>
<L>Of rain and rattling hail a mingled shower;</L>
<L>The active lightning ran along the ground;</L>
<L>The fiery bolts by fits were hurl'd around,</L>
<L>And the wide forests trembled at the sound.</L>
<L>Amazement seiz'd the prince;—where could he fly?</L>
<L>No guide to lead, no friendly cottage nigh.</L>
<L>Pensive and unresolv'd awhile he stood,</L>
<L>Beneath the scanty covert of the wood;</L>
<L>But drove from thence soon sallied forth again,</L>
<L>As chance directed, on the dreary plain;</L>
<L>Constrain'd his melancholy way to take</L>
<L>Through many a loathsome bog, and thorny brake,</L>
<L>Caught in the thicket, flound'ring in the lake.</L>
<L>Wet with the storm, and wearied with the way,</L>
<L>By hunger pinch'd, himself to beasts a prey;</L>
<L><PB N="198" REF="200"/>Nor wine to cheer his heart, nor fire to burn,</L>
<L>Nor place to rest, nor prospect to return.</L>
<L>Drooping and spiritless, at life's despair,</L>
<L>He bade it pass, not worth his farther care;</L>
<L>When suddenly he spied a distant light,</L>
<L>That faintly twinkled through the gloom of night,</L>
<L>And his heart leap'd for joy, and bless'd the welcome sight.</L>
<L>Oft-times he doubted, it appear'd so far,</L>
<L>And hung so high, 'twas nothing but a star,</L>
<L>Or kindled vapour wand'ring through the sky,</L>
<L>But still press'd on his steed, still kept it in his eye;</L>
<L>'Till, much fatigue and many dangers past,</L>
<L>At a huge mountain he arriv'd at last.</L>
<L>There, lighting from his horse, on hands and knees</L>
<L>Grop'd out the darksome road by slow degrees,</L>
<L>Crawling or clamb'ring o'er the rugged way;</L>
<L>The thunder rolls above, the flames around him play.</L>
<L>Joyful at length he gain'd the steepy height,</L>
<L>And found the rift whence sprang the friendly light.</L>
<L>And here he stopp'd to rest his wearied feet,</L>
<L>And weigh the perils he had still to meet;</L>
<L>Unsheath'd his trusty sword, and dealt his eyes</L>
<L>With caution round him to prevent surprize;</L>
<L>Then summon'd all the forces of his mind,</L>
<L>And ent'ring boldly cast his fears behind,</L>
<L>Resolv'd to push his way, whate'er withstood,</L>
<L>Or perish bravely, as a monarch should.</L>

<L>While he the wonders of the place survey'd,</L>

<L>Her shrivel'd skin, with yellow spots besmear'd,</L>

<L>Around the cave; came rushing in amain</L>
<L>Lybs, Eurus, Boreas, all the boist'rous train;</L>
<L>And close behind them on a whirlwind rode</L>

<L>Their cheeks like full-blown bladders strutted out;</L>

<HEAD>DIALOGUE TO CHLORINDA.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. ALSOP<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Anthony Alsop, the author of this dialogue and of the three subsequent poems, was educated in Westminster college, and from thence elected to Christ Church in Oxford, where he took the degrees of M. A. March 23, 1696, and of <HI>B. D.</HI> Dec. 12, 1706. On his coming to the university he was very soon distinguished by Dean Aldrich. He passed through the usual offices in his college to that of Censor with considerable reputation, and for some years had the prin∣cipal noblemen and gentlemen belonging to the society committed to his care. In this useful employment he continued until his merits re∣commended him to Sir Jonathan Trelawny, Bishop of Winchester, who appointed him his chaplain, and soon after gave him a prebend in his own Cathedral, together with the rectory of Brightwell, in the county of Berks, which afforded him ample provision for a learned retirement, in which he remained to the end of his days; and so well satisfied was he with a recluse life, that he could not be drawn from it by the repeated solicitations of those who thought him qualified for a more public character and a higher station. His death, which happened June 10, 1726, was occasioned by his falling into a ditch that led to his garden door, the path being narrow, and part of it giving way un∣der his feet.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>

<HEAD>The FABLE of IXION. To CHLORINDA.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY THE SAME.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>IXION, as the poets tell us,</L>
<L>Was one of those pragmatic fellows,</L>
<L>Who claim a right to kiss the hand</L>
<L>Of the best lady in the land;</L>
<L>Demonstrating, by dint of reason,</L>
<L>That impudence in love's no treason.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He let his fancy soar much higher;</L>
<L>And ventur'd boldly to aspire</L>
<L>To Juno's high and mighty grace,</L>
<L>And woo'd the goddess face to face.</L>
<L>What mortal e'er had whims so odd,</L>
<L>To think of cuckolding a God?</L>
<L>For she was both Jove's wife and sister,</L>
<L>And yet the rascal would have kiss'd her.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How he got up to heaven's high palace,</L>
<L>Not one of all the poets tell us;</L>
<L>It must be therefore understood,</L>
<L>That he got up which way he could.</L>
<L>Nor is it, that I know, recorded,</L>
<L>How bows were made, and speeches worded;</L>
<L><PB N="262" REF="266"/>So, leaving this to each one's guess,</L>
<L>I'll only tell you the success.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But first I stop awhile to shew</L>
<L>What happen'd lately here below.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Chlorinda, who beyond compare</L>
<L>Of all the fair-ones is most fair;</L>
<L>Chlorinda, by the Gods design'd</L>
<L>To be the pattern of her kind,</L>
<L>With every charm of face and mind;</L>
<L>Glanc'd light'ning from her eyes so blue,</L>
<L>And shot poor Strephon through and through.</L>
<L>He, over head and ears her lover,</L>
<L>Try'd all the ways he could to move her;</L>
<L>He sigh'd, and vow'd, and pray'd, and cry'd,</L>
<L>And did a thousand things beside:</L>
<L>She let him sigh, and pray, and cry on—</L>
<L>But now hear more about Ixion.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Goddess, proud (as folks report her),</L>
<L>Disdain'd that mortal wight should court her,</L>
<L>And yet she chose the fool to flatter,</L>
<L>To make him fancy some great matter,</L>
<L>And hope in time he might get at her;</L>
<L>Grac'd him with now and then a smile,</L>
<L>But inly scorn'd him all the while;</L>
<L>Resolv'd at last a trick to shew him,</L>
<L>Seeming to yield, and so undo him.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="263" REF="267"/>
<L>Now which way, do you think, she took?</L>
<L>(For do't she would by hook or crook):</L>
<L>Why, thus I find it in my book.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She call'd a pretty painted cloud,</L>
<L>The brightest of the wand'ring crowd;</L>
<L>For she, you know, is queen o'th' air,</L>
<L>And all the clouds and vapours there</L>
<L>Governs at will, by nod or summons,</L>
<L>As Walpole does the house of commons.</L>
<L>This cloud, which came to her stark-naked,</L>
<L>She dress'd as fine as hands could make it.</L>
<L>For her own wardrobe out she brought</L>
<L>Whate'er was dainty, wove or wrought;</L>
<L>A smock which Pallas spun and gave her,</L>
<L>Once on a time to gain her favour;</L>
<L>A gown that ha'n't on earth its fellow,</L>
<L>Of finest blue, and lin'd with yellow,</L>
<L>Fit for a goddess to appear in,</L>
<L>And not a pin the worse for wearing;</L>
<L>A quilted petticoat beside,</L>
<L>With whalebone hoop six fathom wide;</L>
<L>With these she deck'd the cloud, d'ye see?</L>
<L>As like herself, as like could be:</L>
<L>So like, that could not I or you know</L>
<L>Which was the cloud, and which was Juno.</L>
<L>Thus dress'd she sent it to the villain,</L>
<L>To let him act his wicked will on:</L>
<L><PB N="264" REF="268"/>Then laugh'd at the poor fool aloud,</L>
<L>Who for a goddess grasp'd a cloud.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This, you will say, was well done on her</L>
<L>T' expose the tempter of her honour—</L>
<L>But more of him you need not hear;</L>
<L>Only to Strephon lend an ear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He never entertain'd one thought</L>
<L>With which a goddess could find fault;</L>
<L>His spotless love might be forgiven</L>
<L>By every saint in earth and heaven.</L>
<L>Juno herself, though nice and haughty,</L>
<L>Would not have judg'd his passion naughty.</L>
<L>All this Chlorinda's self confess'd,</L>
<L>And own'd his flame was pure and chaste,</L>
<L>Read what his teeming Muse brought forth,</L>
<L>And prais'd it far beyond its worth:</L>
<L>Mildly receiv'd his fond address,</L>
<L>And only blam'd his love's excess:</L>
<L>Yet she, so good, so sweet, so smiling,</L>
<L>So full of truth, so unbeguiling,</L>
<L>One way or other still devis'd</L>
<L>To let him see he was despis'd:</L>
<L>And when he plum'd, and grew most proud,</L>
<L>All was a vapour, all a cloud.</L>

<L>Where the biddyes were stray'd, or who stole 'em.</L>

<L>Chlorinda, whom none can appproach</L>

On the accession of King George the First he was appointed Secretary at War, and afterwards Cofferer of the Houshold. In 1725 he detached himself from his connexions at court, and entered so warmly into opposition to the measures of the Crown, that on July 1, 1731, he was struck out of the list of Privy Counsellors with the King's own hand, and at the same time ordered to be put out of every commission of the peace. He succeeded at length in his con∣test with the minister Sir Robert Walpole, who in 1741 resigned his employments; and Mr. Pulteney was again sworn of the Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vy Council, and created Baron of Heydon, Viscount Pulteney, and Earl of Bath. From this period he lost his popularity; and during the remainder of George the Second's reign passed his life with little notice or respect from the world.

<HEAD>EPISTLE FROM HENRY ST. JOHN LORD VISCOUNT BOLINGBROKE TO MISS LUCY ATKINS<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">An orange girl.</NOTE>. Written when he was young.</HEAD>
<L>DEAR thoughtless CLARA, to my verse attend,</L>
<L>Believe for once thy lover and thy friend;</L>
<L>Heaven to each sex has various gifts assign'd,</L>
<L>And shewn an equal care of human-kind;</L>
<L>Strength does to man's imperial race belong,</L>
<L>To yours that beauty which subdues the strong;</L>
<L>But as our strength, when misapply'd, is lost,</L>
<L>And what should save, urges our ruin most;</L>
<L>Just so, when beauty prostituted lies,</L>
<L>Of bawds the prey, of rakes th' abandon'd prize,</L>
<L>Women no more their empire can maintain,</L>
<L>Nor hope, vile slaves of lust, by love to reign.</L>
<L>Superior charms but make their case the worse,</L>
<L>And what should be their blessing, proves their curse.</L>
<L>O nymph! that might, reclin'd on Cupid's breast,</L>
<L>Like Psyche, sooth the God of love to rest;</L>
<L>Or, if ambition mov'd thee, Jove enthral,</L>
<L>Brandish his thunder, and direct its fall;</L>
<L><PB N="290" REF="294"/>Survey thyself, contemplate every grace</L>
<L>Of that sweet form, of that angelic face;</L>
<L>Then, CLARA, say, were those delicious charms</L>
<L>Meant for lewd brothels, and rude russians arms?</L>
<L>No, CLARA, no! that person, and that mind,</L>
<L>Were form'd by nature, and by heaven design'd</L>
<L>For nobler ends; to these return, though late,</L>
<L>Return to these, and so avert thy fate.</L>
<L>Think, CLARA, think, (nor will that thought be vain)</L>
<L>Thy slave, thy HARRY, doom'd to drag his chain</L>
<L>Of love, ill-treated and abus'd, that he</L>
<L>From more inglorious chains might rescue thee.</L>
<L>Thy drooping health restor'd; by his fond care,</L>
<L>Once more thy beauty its full lustre wear;</L>
<L>Mov'd by his love, by his example taught,</L>
<L>Soon shall thy soul, once more with virtue fraught,</L>
<L>With kind and gen'rous truth thy bosom warm,</L>
<L>And thy fair mind, like thy fair person, charm.</L>
<L>To virtue thus, and to thyself restor'd,</L>
<L>By all admir'd, by one alone ador'd,</L>
<L>Be to thy HARRY ever kind and true,</L>
<L>And live for him, who more than dies for you.</L>

<LG>
<L>LOOK round the wide world, each profession, you'll find,</L>
<L>Hath something dishonest, which myst'ry they call;</L>
<L>Each knave points another, at home is stark-blind;</L>
<L>Except but his own, there's a cheat in them all:</L>
<L>When tax'd with imposture, the charge he'll evade,</L>
<L>And like Falstaff pretend he but lives by his trade.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The hero ambitious (like Philip's great son,</L>
<L>Who wept when he found no more mischief to do)</L>
<L>Ne'er scruples a neighbouring realm to o'er-run,</L>
<L>While slaughters and carnage his sabre imbrue.</L>
<L>Of rapine and murder the charge he'll evade,</L>
<L>For conquest is glorious, and fighting his trade.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The statesman, who steers by wise Machiavel's rules,</L>
<L>Is ne'er to be known by his tongue or his face;</L>
<L>They're traps by him us'd to catch credulous fools,</L>
<L>And breach of his promise he counts no disgrace;</L>
<L>But policy calls it, reproach to evade,</L>
<L>For flatt'ry's his province, cajoling his trade.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="292" REF="296"/>
<L>The priest will instruct you this world to despise,</L>
<L>With all its vain pomp, for a kingdom on high;</L>
<L>While earthly preferments are chiefly his prize,</L>
<L>And all his pursuits give his doctrine the lye;</L>
<L>He'll plead you the gospel, your charge to evade:</L>
<L>The lab'rer's entitled to live by his trade.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The lawyer, as oft on the wrong side as right,</L>
<L>Who tortures for fee the true sense of the laws,</L>
<L>While black he by sophistry proves to be white,</L>
<L>And falsehood and perjury lists in his cause,</L>
<L>With steady assurance all crime will evade:</L>
<L>His client's his care, and he follows his trade.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The sons of Machaon, who thirsty for gold</L>
<L>The patient past cure visit thrice in a day,</L>
<L>Write largely the Pharmacop league to uphold,</L>
<L>While poverty's left to diseases a prey,</L>
<L>Are held in repute for their glitt'ring parade:</L>
<L>Their practice is great, and they shine in their trade.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Since then in all stations imposture is found,</L>
<L>No one of another can justly complain;</L>
<L>The coin he receives will pass current around,</L>
<L>And where he is cousen'd he cousens again:</L>
<L>But I, who for cheats this apology made,</L>
<L>Cheat myself by my rhyming, and starve by my trade.</L>

<L>With a prelude of cudgels we first were saluted,</L>

<L>Whereupon the bold Sutton first mounted the stage,</L>
<L>Made his honours as usual, and yearn'd to engage;</L>
<L>Then Figg, with a visage so fierce, yet sedate,</L>
<L>Came and enter'd the lists with his fresh-shaven pate;</L>
<L>Their arms were encircled with armigers too,</L>
<L>With a red ribbon Sutton's, and Figg's with a blue.</L>
<L>Thus adorn'd the two heroes, 'twixt shoulder and elbow,</L>

<L>While the rays of old Phoebus that shot thro' the sky-light.</L>
<L>Seem'd to make on the stage a new kind of twilight;</L>

<L>Figg struck the first stroke, and with such a vast fury,</L>
<L>That he broke his huge weapon in twain, I assure you;</L>
<L>And if his brave rival this blow had not warded,</L>
<L>His head from his shoulders had quite been discarded.</L>
<L>Figg arm'd him again, and they took t' other tilt,</L>
<L>And then Sutton's blade ran away from its hilt;</L>
<L>The weapons were frighted, but as for the men,</L>
<L>In truth they ne'er minded, but at it again.</L>

<L>Such a force in their blows, you'd have thought it a wonder</L>

<L>Her ladyship then seem'd to think the case plain,</L>
<L>But Figg stepping forth with a sullen disdain,</L>

<L>And with a fresh fury they made the swords rattle;</L>
<L>While Sutton's right arm was observed to bleed,</L>
<L>By a touch from his rival, so Jove had decreed;</L>
<L>Just enough for to shew that his blood was not ichor.</L>

<L>Again they both rush'd with as equal a fire on,</L>

<L>They took to their wood, and i'faith never shamm'd it.</L>
<L>The first bout they had was so fair, and so handsome,</L>
<L>That to make a fair bargain, was worth a king's ransom;</L>

<L>Would have made any fibres but Figg's to have smarted.</L>

<L>Then after that bout they went on to another—</L>
<L>But the matter must end on some fashion, or other;</L>
<L>So Jove told the Gods he had made a decree,</L>
<L>That Figg should hit Sutton a stroke on the knee.</L>
<L>Though Sutton disabled as soon as he hit him</L>
<L>Would still have fought on, but Jove would not permit him;</L>
<L>'Twas his fate, not his fault, that constrain'd him to yield,</L>

After four years residence at the Uni∣versity, he was recalled to Eton as an assistant in the school, where he so greatly acquired the respect of the provost and fellows, that in 1727 they elected him into their society, and presented him to the living of Maple Derham, in Oxfordshire. On June the 9th, 1730, he was ap∣pointed chaplain in ordinary to their Majesties, and in the same year took his Doctor of Laws degree at Cambridge.

<L>Who first the secret how to colour sound,</L>
<L>And to give shape to reason, wisely found;</L>
<L>With bodies how to cloath ideas, taught;</L>
<L>And how to draw the picture of a thought:</L>
<L>Who taught the hand to speak, the eye to hear</L>
<L>A silent language roving far and near;</L>
<L>Whose softest noise outstrips loud thunder's sound,</L>
<L>And spreads her accents through the world's vast round;</L>
<L>A voice heard by the deaf, spoke by the dumb,</L>

<L>THE noble art to Cadmus owes its rise</L>

<L>He first in wond'rous magic fetters bound</L>

<L>"Thus rebuff'd and surpriz'd they apply'd to the vine:</L>
<L>"He answer'd; Shall I leave my grapes and my wine,</L>
<L>"(Wine the sovereign cordial of god and of man)</L>
<L>"To be made or the tool or head of a clan?</L>
<L>"At last, as it always falls out in a scramble,</L>
<L>"The mob gave the cry for a bramble! a bramble!</L>
<L>"A bramble for ever! O! chance unexpected!</L>
<L>"But bramble prevail'd, and was duly elected."</L>

<L>"O! ho! quoth the knight with a look most profound,</L>

<L><NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">An ingenious person, who sent Mr. Gray his remarks anonymously on this and the following ode soon after they were published, gives this stanza and the following a very just and well-expressed eulogy: <Q>A poet is perhaps never more conciliating than when he praises favou∣rite predecessors in his art. Milton is not more the pride than Shak∣speare the love of their country: it is therefore equally judicious to diffuse a tenderness and a grace through the praise of Shakspeare, as to extol in a strain more elevated and sonorous the boundless soarings of Milton's epic imagination.</Q> The critic has here well noted the beauty of contrast which results from the two descriptions; yet it is further to be observed, to the honor of our poet's judgment, that the tenderness and grace in the former does not prevent it from strongly characterizing the three capital persections of Shakspeare's genius; and when he describes his power of exciting terror (a species of the sub∣lime he ceases to be diffuse, and becomes, as he ought to be, concise and energetical.

<P>This has been condemned as a false thought, and more worthy of an Italian poet than of Mr. Gray. Count Algarotti, we have found in his letter to Mr. How, praises it highly; but as he was an Italian critic, his judgment, in this point, will not, perhaps by many, be thought to overbalance the objection. The truth is, that this fiction of the cause of Milton's blindness is not beyond the bounds of poetical credibility, any more than the fiction which precedes it concerning the birth of Shakspeare; and therefore would be equally admissible, had it not the peculiar misfortune to encounter a fact too well known: on this ac∣count the judgment revolts against it. Milton himself has told us, in a strain of heart-felt exultation, (see his Sonnet to Cyriac Skynner) that he lost his eye-sight, <Q><L>—overply'd</L>
<L>IN LIBERTY'S DEFENCE, <HI>his</HI> noble task;</L>
<L>Whereof all Europe rings from side to side;</L></Q></P>
<P>And, when we know this to have been the true cause, we cannot ad∣mit a fictitious one, however sublimely conceived, or happily expressed. If therefore so lofty and unrivalled a description will not atone for this acknowledged defect, in relation to matter of fact, all that the impartial critic can do, is to point out the reason, and to apologize for the poet, who was necessitated by his subject to consider Milton only in his poeti∣cal capacity.</P>
<P>Since the above note was published, Mr. Brand, of East-Dearham, in Norfolk, has favoured me with a letter, in which he informs me of a very similar hyperbole extant in a MS. commentary upon Plato's Phae∣don, written by Hermias, a christian philosopher, of the second century, and which is printed in Bayle's Dictionary (Art. Achilles.) It con∣tains the following anecdote of Homer:—<Q>That keeping some sheep near the tomb of Achilles, he obtained, by his offerings and suppli∣cations, a sight of that hero; who appeared to him surrounded with so much glory that Homer could not bear the splendor of it, and that he was not only dazzled, but blinded by the sight.</Q> The ingenious gentleman makes no doubt but Mr. Gray took his thought from this passage, and applauds him for the manner in which he has improved upon it: he also thinks in general <Q>that a deviation from historical truth, though it may cast a shade over the middling beauties of poetry, produces no bad effect where the magnificence and brilliancy of the images entirely fill the imagination;</Q> and with regard to this passage in prticular, he intimates, <Q>that as the cause of Milton's blind∣ness is not so well known as the thing itself, the licence of poetical invention may allow him to assign a cause different from the real fact.</Q> However this may be, the very exact resemblance, which the two thoughts bear to one another, will, I hope, vindicate Mr. Gray's from being a modern concetto in the taste of the Italian school, as it has been deemed to be by some critics. But this resemblance will do more (and it is on this account chiefly that I produce, and thank the gentleman for communicating it); it will prove the extreme uncertainty of dec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ding upon poetical imitations; for I am fully persuaded that Mr. Gray had never seen, or at least attended to, this Greek fragment. How scrupul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us he was in borrowing even an epithet from another poet, many of his notes on this very ode fully prove. And as to the passage in question, he would certainly have cited it, for the sake of vindicating his own taste by classical authority, especially when the thought had been so much controverted.</P></NOTE>Closed his eyes in endless night.</L>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING now, by the advice and assistance of my friends, brought this Collection of POEMS to a com∣petent size, it has been thought proper that the farther progress of its growth should here be stopp'd. From the loose and fugitive pieces, some printed, others in ma∣nuscript, which for forty or fifty years past have been thrown into the world, and carelessly left to perish; I have here, according to the most judicious opinions I could obtain in distinguishing their merits, endeavour'd to select and preserve the best. The favourable reception which the former volumes have met with, demands my warmest ac∣knowledgments, and calls for all my care in compleating the Collection; and in this respect, if it appear that I have not been altogether negligent, I shall hope to be allowed the merit, which is all I claim, of having furnished to the Public an elegant and polite Amusement. Little more need be added, than to return my thanks to several inge∣nious friends, who have obligingly contributed to this Entertainment. If the reader should happen to find, what I hope he seldom will, any pieces which he may think un∣worthy of having been inserte; as it would ill become me to attribute his dislike of them to his own want of Taste, so I am too conscious of my own deficiencies not to allow him to impute the insertion of them to mine.</P>
