<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IF a variety of editions, and innumerable comments can be supposed to perfect and correct the inaccurate text of a celebrated au∣thor, sufficient, one would think, has been done to leave that of Shakspeare without a blemish. So slow, however, or so inefficaci∣ous, is the progress and exertion of verbal criticism, when moiling in the dust and cob∣webs of antiquity, so much is to be demo∣lished, so much to be rebuilt, that it will not, except to those who place implicit confi∣dence in the interested and unqualifyed asser∣tions of every publisher, be a matter of much surprise to learn, that, after all that has been done by the labour of Shakspeares numerous editors and commentators,—after all that has been urged or assumed in favour of the last
<PB N="ii" REF="3"/>edition, — as much more still remains to be done to bring his text back even to the state of correct∣ness in which it was left by his first editors. A reader of hesitation and reflection will hear this with perfect calmness; he will be no stranger to the fluctuating state of former editions; he will have noticed the boldness and assurance, the legislative and dictatorial manner in which every succeeding editor has ushered hisself into the world; and will not easyly forget the con∣fidence of each in assuring the public that no∣thing further could possibly be done to his author:—Is not this the language of Rowe, and Pope, and Theobald, and Warburton, and Hanmer, and Capell? And where are they now? Where even dr. Johnson and mr. Steevens may, in the course of a few revolving years, be sent to accompany them:—the re∣gions of oblivion or disgrace.</P>
<P>The chief and fundamental business of an editor is carefully to collate the original and authentic editions of his author. It is other∣wise impossible for him to be certain that he is giving the genuine text, because he does not know what that text is. There have been no less than eight professed editors of Shakspeare; and
<PB N="iii" REF="4"/>yet the old copies, of which we have heard so much, have never been collated by any one of them: no, not even either of the two first folios, books indifferently common, and quoted by every body. And yet, strange as it may seem, not one of the eight but has taken the credit of, or actually asserted, his having collated them. One may be well al∣lowed to pass by the pretensions of those prior to dr. Johnson without particular notice; their falsehood is sufficiently apparent in the margin of the late edition. Surely, men who thus proudly expose and severely reprobate the crimes of their neighbours should effectually guard theirselves against similar accusations.</P>
<P>"I," says dr. Johnson, "collated such co∣pies as I could procure, and wished for more
<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">(1) Preface, p. 59.</NOTE>:" "I collated ... all [the folios] at the beginning, but afterwards used only the first
<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">(2) Ibidem, p. 49.</NOTE>." He must be very hardy, indeed, that dares give a flat contradiction to such positive assertions as these from so respectable a cha∣racter. But the cause of Shakspeare and truth obliges one to say that the learned writer is certainly mistaken. The text of his own edi∣tion,
<PB N="iv" REF="5"/>the notes of mr. Steevens, and, in some respect, the remarks in the following sheets, will prove that he never collated any one of the folios, —no not for a single play,— or at least that of his collations he has made little or no use. That he picked out a reading here and there from the old editions, is true: all his predecessors did the same: but this is not <HI>colla∣tion.</HI> So much for dr. Johnson.</P>
<P>With regard to the last edition, mr. Steevens explicitly tells us that "it has been constantly compared with the most authentic copies, whe∣ther collation was absolutely necessary to the sense, or not
<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">(3) Advertisement, p. 69.</NOTE>." "Would not any one, from this declaration," to use the ingenious critics own words, "suppose that he had at least <HI>compared</HI> the <HI>folios</HI> with each other
<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">(4) Ibidem, p. 68.</NOTE>?" But he has been deceived, no doubt, by the person employed in this laborious but necessary work. What an abuse of that confidence and credit which the public naturally place in an editor of rank and character, to tell them, that "by a diligent collation of all the old copies hi∣therto discovered, and the judicious restoration
<PB N="v" REF="6"/>of ancient readings, the text of this author seems now finally settled
<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">(5) Malones preface to his Supplement.</NOTE>!" To what bet∣ter cause can we ascribe such unfounded as∣sertions than to indolence and temerity? since, had the ingenious writer compared the old and present editions through a single play, he must necessaryly have perceived, that all the old copies had NOT been diligently collated, that ancient readings had NOT been judiciously re∣stored, and that the text is no more finally settled at present than it was in the time of Theobald, Hanmer, and Warburton: nay, that it is, at large, in the same state of inac∣curacy and corruption in which it was left by mr. Rowe.</P>
<P>These, it may be objected, are merely nega∣tive and unproved assertions. It is very true. And they who do not think them confirmed in the course of the following pages, and will not give theirselves the trouble to investigate their truth, are at liberty to disbelieve them. To publish the various readings of the old edi∣tions would be a busyness of some labour, and little utility.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="7"/>
As to the notes and conjectures here offered to the public, very little need be said. Shak∣speare is <HI>the God of the writers idolatry,</HI> and should any one of these remarks be thought pertinent or useful in the opinion of a single individual who, like him, admires the effu∣sions of this darling child of nature and fancy, whom, <HI>age cannot wither,</HI> and whose <HI>infinite variety custom cannot stale,</HI> it will be a suffi∣cient gratification to him for the pains be∣stowed in drawing them up. And if there should be a future edition of this favourite, this inimitable author, the writer is not with∣out vanity to hope that the following sheets may stimulate the editors care and attention to give his text with integrity, judgement, and cor∣rectness, —
<Q><L>— a consummation</L>
<L>Devoutly to be wish'd;</L></Q> and, which must of consequence follow, to re∣duce the number of exuberant and impertinent notes
<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">(6) From a republication of the last edition nothing is to be expected. The work will continue, like the editions of Warburton and Hanmer, to dishonour crit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and to insult Shakspeare.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The freedom with which every editor has treated his predecessors precludes the necessity
<PB N="vii" REF="8"/>of an apology for the liberties taken in the en∣suing pages, with the sentiments of some of our most eminent literary characters. The su∣periority of a commentators rank, however, does not intitle his blunders to respect. It were to be wished that dr. Johnson had shewn somewhat less partiality to <HI>pride of place;</HI> for, though he professes to have treated his prede∣cessors with candour, Theobald, the best of Shakspeares editors, experiences as much scur∣rility and injustice at his hands, as Hanmer and Warburton, the worst of them, do defe∣rence and respect. For this, however, the learned critic might have his private reasons, which, as they could scarcely have justifyed his conduct, he did right to conceal.</P>
<P>To controvert the opinions, or disprove the assertions of mr. Steevens, dr. Farmer and mr. Tyrwhitt, men no less remarkable for their learning and genius than for their obliging dispositions and amiable manners, has been a painful and odious task. But whereever the writer has been under the necessity of differing from any of these gentlemen either in point of opinion or in point of fact, he will not be
<PB N="viii" REF="9"/>found to have expressed hisself in a manner inconsistent with a due sense of obligations and the profoundest respect. Such, at least, was his intention, such has been his endeavour, and such is his hope.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">(SHAKSPEARES WILL.)</HEAD>
<P>The slightest alteration in the name of this great writer is a circumstance of so much importance to the public, that, although the editors may not have been too hasty in preferring SHAKSPEARE to SHAKESPEARE, it might be wished that a more decisive and less equivocal au∣thority than his WILL had been produced to justify and enforce the change. This will, it should seem, the poet made in his last sickness, when he appears to have been so incapable of paying that attention to the writing of his name which a man in health usually does, that he has actually subscribed it two different ways: SHAKSPERE, and SHAKSPEARE. So that we are still uncertain which mode to adopt. How negligent, therefor, have the editors been, and how much are they to be blamed, for not procuring better and more positive evidence, if it were to be come at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="2" REF="11"/>it certainly was! Mr. Garrick, as they must have known, though they did not think it necessary to notice the fact, had then in his possession a lease or mortgage from Shakspeare of a house in Blackfriars, subscribed (as we learn from mr. Colmans preface to Beaumont and Fletcher) with his own hand, WM. SHAKSPEARE; which, very luckyly, confirms the alteration made, with less authority, by the present editors. This deed was discovered among some old writings by mr. Wallis, of Norfolk-street, who presented it to mr. Garrick, in the possession of whose widow it, most probably, still re∣mains. Mr. Colman likewise informs us, that the name is, in the poets own county, pronounced with the first <HI>a</HI> short
<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">(1) This pronunciation is right. Twice in the body of his will, and once in the margin,—that is, except the signatures, whereever his name occurs,— it is written SHACKSPEARE: and the instrument itself is, by two different indorsements, called MR. SHACKSPERES will.</NOTE>, and, in the register of Stratford church, uniformly entered SHAKSPERE.</P>

<P>One <HI>Hamlet</HI> (or <HI>Hamnet</HI>) Sadler, being a witness to, and mentioned in Shakspeares will, mr. Malone takes it for granted that he acquired this name from the testators tragedy of Ham∣let; and thence infers, at least gives it as one reason, that the play must have been written in 1596; that he might be of what the critic thinks a competent age for a witness. In fact, however, the name of <HI>Hamlet</HI> was in common use long before Shakspeare was able to write a line; so that the gentle∣mans presumption must, in this instance, necessaryly fall to the ground.</P>

<P>Whenever the <HI>Merry Wives of Windsor</HI> may have been writt∣en, it is certain, as well from the enquirers quotations and remarks, as from the play its self, that the time of action is in the reign of king Henry the fourth. But "if it should be placed," says he, "as dr. Johnson observes it should be read, between the <HI>Second part of K. Henry IV.</HI> and <HI>Henry V.</HI>" (where, however, it cannot be introduced without the most flagrant impropriety) "it must be remembered that mrs. Quickly, who is half-bawd, half-hostess in <HI>K. Henry IV.</HI> is, in the <HI>Merry Wives of Windsor,</HI> Dr. Caius's housekeeper, and makes a decent appearance; and in <HI>K. Henry V.</HI> is Pistols wife, and dies in an hospital; a progression that is not very natural." It is strange enough that the critic should not perceive that <HI>Dr. Caiuses housekeeper</HI> and <HI>the land∣lady of the Boars-head</HI> are totally distinct characters; and have not, if we except their name, sex, sentiments, and loquacity, a single circumstance in common between them. Shakspeare could have been at no loss for one of the same name and family in any town in England.</P>

<L>Oh, how this spring of love <HI>resembleth</HI></L>
<L>The uncertain glory of an April day;</L>
<L>Which now shews all the beauty of the sun,</L>
<L>And by and by a cloud takes all away!</L>
</SP>
<P><HI>Resembleth,</HI> mr. Tyrwhitt says, is here used as a quadri∣syllable, as if it was written <HI>resembeleth.</HI> And in support of this assertion he instances the two following lines: the one from the <HI>Comedy of Errors,</HI> the other from <HI>As you like it:</HI>
<Q><L>And these two Dromios, one in <HI>semblance.</HI></L>
<L>The parts and graces of the <HI>wrestler.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>"And it should be observed," continues he, "that Shake∣speare takes the same liberty with many other words, in
<PB N="7" REF="16"/>which <HI>l</HI> or <HI>r</HI> are [is] subjoined to another consonant. See <HI>Com. of Errors:</HI>
<Q>"These are the parents to these <HI>children.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Steevens, in a note immediately preceding mr. Tyrwhitts, has observed, that when a word was not long enough to complete the measure, our early writers occasio∣nally extended it. Thus, says he, Spenser in his <HI>Faery Queen:</HI>
<Q>"Formerly grounded, and fast <HI>setteled.</HI>"</Q>
Again:
<Q><L>"The while sweet Zephirus loud <HI>whisteled,</HI></L>
<L>"His treble, a strange kind of harmony;</L>
<L>"Which Guyon's senses softly <HI>tickeled,</HI>" &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P>From this practice, he supposes, the author wrote <HI>resem∣beleth,</HI> which, though it affords no jingle, completes the verse. "The old ballad of <HI>Titus Andronicus,</HI>" adds he, "is written in this measure, where the <HI>second</HI> and <HI>fourth</HI> lines <HI>only</HI> rhime." Whether this be a fact or not "let the forest judge." The ballad is printed by Percy, and begins thus: (the stanza being the same throughout:)
<Q><L>You noble minds, and famous martiall wights,</L>
<L>That in defence of native country fights,</L>
<L>Give eare to me that ten yeeres fought for Rome,</L>
<L>Yet reapt disgrace at my returning home.</L></Q></P>
<P>There is much greater and more important matter i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> these observations than either of the ingenious commenta∣tors was aware of. Neither Shakspeare nor Spenser ap∣pears, from the above instances, at least, to have taken the smallest liberty in extending his words: neither has the in∣cident of <HI>l</HI> or <HI>r</HI> being subjoined to another consonant any thing to do in the matter. But that great authors and great critics should not be better acquainted with the orthography and grammatical structure of their native tongue, is a circum∣stance which, if not to be wondered at, is, surely, very much
<PB N="8" REF="17"/>to be regretted. The truth is, that <HI>every</HI> verb in the English lan∣guage gains an <HI>additional syllable</HI> by its termination in <HI>est, eth, ed, ing,</HI> or (when formed into a substantive) in <HI>er:</HI> and the above words, when rightly printed, are not onely unexception∣able, but most just. Thus, <HI>resemble</HI> makes <HI>resemble-eth; wrestle, wrestle-er;</HI> and <HI>settle, whistle, tickle,</HI> make <HI>settle-ed, whistle-ed; tickle-ed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Semblance,</HI> indeed, cannot properly be written as three syllables; neither, perhaps, is it altogether necessary to pronounce it so. <HI>Childeren,</HI> however, would be certainly right.</P>
<P>Another instance of this sort occurs in <HI>K. John:</HI>
<Q>That were <HI>embatteled</HI> and rank'd in Kent:</Q> which should now be written <HI>embattleed;</HI> though the verb was, probably enough, in Shakspeares time, usually spelled <HI>embattel.</HI></P>
<P>Again, in Butlers panegyric on sir John Denham:
<Q><L>No poet jeer'd for <HI>scribbling</HI> amiss,</L>
<L>With verses forty times more lewd than his.</L></Q></P>
<P>Here <HI>scribbling</HI> should be printed <HI>scribbleing:</HI> the metre evidently requiring three syllables, which are necessaryly articulated in the pronunciation.</P>
<P>These ideas, had they been more germane to the object of the present sheets, or more likely to experience a favora∣ble reception, might have been much expanded and further pursued; but, indeed, our orthographical system is so tho∣roughly corrupted, and the principles and formation of the language are, even by those who have professedly treated the subject
<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">(2) Johnson, Priestley, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>, so little investigated or understood, that a writer, hardy enough to attempt a reform, will naturally expect to find many of his clearest axioms considered as the offspring of singularity, affectation, and caprice.</P>

There is not, however, the least room for altera∣tion; Shakspeare has evidently intended to make honest Launce puzzle and confound hisself in the arrangement of his <HI>dramatis personae;</HI> and, it should seem, he has tolerably well succeeded.</P>
<P>A similar thought, mr. Steevens observes, occurs in a play of an <HI>elder</HI> date than this: <HI>A Christian turn'd Turk,</HI> 1612. The <HI>Two Gentlemen of Verona</HI> is mentioned by Meres in 1598; and, in the opinion of mr. Malone, "bears strong internal marks of an early composition." He therefor refers it to the year 1593. Surely then the play quoted by mr. Steevens can hardly be supposed to be of an elder date.</P>

<P>Hope is a <HI>curtail'd dog</HI> in some affairs.</P>
</SP>
<P>The tail, says dr. Johnson, is counted necessary to the agility of a grey-hound; and one method, he observes, of disqualifying a dog, according to the forest-laws, is [was] to cut his tail, and make him a <HI>curtail.</HI> A <HI>curtail-dog,</HI> adds mr. Steevens, was the dog of an unqualifyed person, whose tail, by the <HI>laws of the forest,</HI> was <HI>cut off.</HI></P>
<P>But it does not appear that there either is, or could be any such regulation in the <HI>Forest-laws;</HI> as <HI>greyhounds,</HI> which alone would be disqualifyed by <HI>excauditation,</HI> could never have been the objects of laws made solely for the pre∣servation of the kings deer. By those <HI>modern forest-laws,</HI> however, the <HI>acts of parliament for the preservation</HI> (<HI>i. e.</HI> destruction) <HI>of the Game,</HI> as expounded by that learned and respectable body ycleped <HI>Justices of the Peace;</HI> an <HI>unqua∣lifyed</HI> person is allowed to keep a <HI>curtailed greyhound,</HI> without incurring the penalties of the aforesaid statutes, in which it is difficult to say whether Justice or Humanity be most apparent. A <HI>curtail dog,</HI> simply, is one of that inferior species of those animals, now called <HI>curs,</HI> from the prevailing usage of cutting their tails. A piece of wanton barbarity which (though, by no means, singular, even in <HI>this</HI> country) can onely be perpetrated by unfeeling wretches who seem to enjoy no more reason than is just sufficient to plunge them into a more degraded and brutal state than that of the poor animal they so inhumanly mangle.</P>

<P>That Julietta enters at the same time with Claudio;— that she is not present during his conversation with Lucio; —and that she is afterwards in the custody of the pro∣vost;—are evident and certain.

<P>It was <HI>fourteen years</HI> in all the editions prior to Theobald who made the alteration.

<Q><L>—the enrolled penalties</L>

<P>The remark is ingenious, but not decisive. It is hardly generous or candid to make the author absurd, when his language or sentiment will obviously bear a different and rational interpretation.

"I think it just worth while to observe," says dr.

<P>If it were worth the learned prelates while to make this observation, it may be worth the while of an inferior per∣son to contradict it. For, ingenious as the distinction may seem, and implicitly as it has been adopted, there is not the smallest authority for it, unless the great critics dogma∣tical assertion may be termed so. He doubtless thought that the word <HI>mystery</HI> was too sublime and sacred to be mixed with the profane and vulgar ideas of <HI>base mechanicals;</HI> and that such vile objects as <HI>trades</HI> and <HI>manual professions</HI> ought not to participate in the use of a name set apart for the inexpli∣cable solemnities of Christianity. But the truth is, that the word, in its highest or lowest acceptation, means no more or less than the <HI>secret</HI> or <HI>arcana</HI> of any CRAFT, <HI>civil</HI> or <HI>religious;</HI> in <HI>faith</HI> or in <HI>works;</HI> and whether we are talking of the <HI>mystery</HI> of the <HI>Blessed Trinity,</HI> or the <HI>mystery</HI> of the <HI>Barber-Surgeons,</HI> we mean <HI>one and the same word,</HI> from <HI>mystere,</HI> Fr.

<P><HI>Band</HI> is here rightly preserved, but it is pleasant enough to mark the consistency of the editors, who make a merit of restoring it from <HI>bond,</HI> which, they observe, is in the old editions, and was formerly spelled <HI>band.</HI> The word <HI>porpentine</HI> appears throughout all the old copies, and in many contemporary writers; but this they have moder∣nised to <HI>porcupine.</HI> The affirmative <HI>I,</HI> always used by Shak∣speare and others, has been likewise changed to <HI>ay,</HI> and fre∣quently to the injury of both sense and rime.

<P>A <HI>band,</HI> Mr. Steevens observes, is likewise a <HI>neckcloth;</HI> and on this circumstance, he believes, the humour of the passage turns.

<P>Thus in the <HI>Two Gentlemen of Verona:</HI>

<P>It is with infinite reluctance that the writer finds hisself obliged to differ in opinion from the learned magistrate, who, from his having so long and so ably presided upon
<PB N="33" REF="42"/>similar occasions, must, no doubt, be perfectly acquainted with the nature of a judicial process.</P>
<P>That there is infinite humour in the passage is very true; and that the ingenious commentator has not discovered it is equally so; the sentiments and conduct of master Dogberry being the direct reverse of what he supposes them to be. We clearly perceive that in this examination Dog∣berry takes all the precaution possible to come at the truth; he charges them <HI>severally</HI> with being <HI>false knaves;</HI> he <HI>takes the utmost care</HI> that they shall have <HI>no communication of counsels,</HI> in order to concert a joint defence, by onely <HI>whispering</HI> to <HI>one,</HI> what he had before asked in the <HI>hearing of both;</HI> he is, therefore, astonished to find them <HI>both in a tale,</HI> and directs it to be recorded, as a proof of their <HI>innocence,—that they are no knaves:</HI>—because they had <HI>both told him so.</HI></P>
<P>This is the more evident from the behaviour of the sex∣ton; who, in mr.

<P>If the learned annotator will amend his comment, by omitting the word <HI>guilt,</HI> and inserting the word <HI>innocence,</HI> it will (except as to the supposed inference of a communica∣tion of counsels which should be likewise omitted or cor∣rected) be a just and pertinent remark.</P>

<PB N="34" REF="43"/>editor and commentator has offered his proper lection, and therefor here's a new one to increase the number.
<Q>And, <HI>sorrow waggery,</HI> hem when he should groan.</Q> <HI>i. e.</HI> sorrow becoming waggery; or, converting sorrow into waggery, hem, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Surely this is at least as good as—<HI>hallow wag, sorrow wage, sorrow gagge, sorrowing, sorry wag,</HI> &amp;c. or even as the present text. The old editions unisormly read,
<Q>And <HI>sorrow, wagge, crie</HI> hem, &amp;c. when he should groan.</Q></P>

<P><HI>i. e.</HI> says bishop Warburton, "what a question's there, or what a foolish question you ask." The learned prelate, one may easyly suppose, would not have hesitated to call a fine lady <HI>fool</HI> to her face: Benedick, it is to be hoped, had rather more politeness. The phrase occurs fre∣quently in Shakspeare, and means no more than—<HI>you ask a question,</HI> or <HI>that is the question.</HI></P>

The word literally means a <HI>graff, slip, scion</HI> or <HI>sucker:</HI> and, by metonymy, comes to be used for a boy or child. <HI>The</HI> imp <HI>his son</HI> is no more than <HI>his infant son.</HI> It is now set apart to signify <HI>young fiends;</HI> as, <HI>"the devil and his</HI> imps."</P>

<P>"Maid. <HI>Fair weather after you. Come Jaquenetta away.</HI>] Thus all the printed copies: but the editors have been guilty of much inadvertence. They make Jaquenetta and a maid enter; whereas Jaquenetta is the onely maid intended by the poet, and is committed to....Dull, to be conveyed....to the lodge in the park. This being the case, it is evi∣dent to demonstration, that—<HI>Fair weather after you</HI>—must be spoken by Jaquenetta; and then that Dull says to her,
<PB N="36" REF="45"/><HI>Come, Jaquenetta, away,</HI> as I have regulated the text. THEOBALD."</P>
<P>Mr. Theobald has endeavoured here to dignify his own industry by a very slight performance. The <HI>folios</HI> ALL read as he reads, except that instead of naming the per∣sons they give their characters, enter <HI>Clown, Constable,</HI> and <HI>Wench.</HI> JOHNSON."</P>
<P>There was no great occasion for this evidence to prove the last learned commentator very little acquainted with the editions of which he speaks with so much fami∣liarity and confidence. The assertion in the note is un∣true: NONE of the folios read as Theobald does: in the first of them the passage stands thus:</P>

<P>Pageant <HI>of the</HI> Nine Worthies.] This sort of procession was the usual recreation of our ancestors at Christmas, and other festive seasons. Such things, being chiefly plotted and composed by ignorant people, were seldom com∣mitted to writing, at least with the view of preservation, and are, of course, rarely discovered in the researches of even the most industrious antiquaries. And it is cer∣tain that nothing of the kind (except the speeches in this scene, which were intended to burlesque them) ever ap∣peared in print. The curious reader will not, therefor, be displeased to see a genuine specimen of the poetry and manner of this rude and ancient drama from an original manuscript of Edward the Fourths time. (MSS.

Possibly it served to conclude the pageant instead of an epilogue, and not impro∣perly.

<L>They — are <HI>apparel'd thus,</HI></L>

</SP>
<P>"The settling commerce in Russia was, at that time, a matter that much ingrossed the concern and conversation of the publick. There had been several embassies employed thither on that occasion; and several tracts of the manners and state of that nation written: so that a mask of Mus∣covites was as good an entertainment to the audience of that time, as a coronation has been since. WARBURTON."</P>
<P>All this may be very true, but the learned commentator might have discovered that a mask of Muscovites was no un∣common recreation at court long before our authors time. In the first year of king Henry the eighth, at a banquet made for the foreign ambassadors in the parliament chamber at Westminster, "came the lorde Henry, Erle of W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ltshire,
<PB N="41" REF="50"/>and the lorde Fitzwater, in twoo long gounes of yelowe satin, trauarsed with white satin, and in euery ben of white, was a bend of crimosen satin after the sashiō of Russia or Ruslande, with furred hattes of grey on their hedes, either of them hauyng an hatchet in their handes, and bootes with pykes turned vp." Hall. Hen. VIII. fo. 6, b. This extract may serve to convey an idea of the dress used, upon the present occasion, by the king and his lords, at the per∣formance of the play.</P>

<P><HI>Dr. Warburtons note upon the old Romances.]</HI> The learned prelate has received such a complete dressing, from the hand of a master, in the <HI>Supplement,</HI> that there is neither occasion nor opportunity for any further remark. At the foot of this page, however, there is a note, by the celebrated dr. Percy, which seems to deserve some little attention; and the more so, as it is countenanced by the very ingenious gentleman alluded to, who has either not been aware of its fallacy, or, from private motives, forborn to expose it.</P>
<P>Dr. Warburton," says this redoubted critic, "is quite mis∣taken in deriving Oliver from (Palmerin de) Oliva, which is utterly incompatible with the genius of the Spanish lan∣guage." So that, from his thus recurring to etymology, he clearly appears to be not a whit better acquainted with the history than dr. Warburton was. "The old ro∣mance," continues he, "of which Oliver was the hero, is entitled in Spanish, "Historias de los nobles Cavalleros Oliveros de Castilla, y Artus de Algarbe, in fol. en Va∣lladolid, 1501, in fol. en Sevilla, 1507;" and in French thus, "Histoire d'Olivier de Castille, &amp; Aitus d'Algarbe son loyal compagnon, &amp; de Heleine, Fille au Roy d'An∣gleterre,
<PB N="42" REF="51"/>&amp;c. translatée du Latin, par Phil. Camus, in fol. Gothique."</P>
<P>From so much seeming knowlege, from the annotators great credit, and from his very confident assertions, who would be foreward to suspect his ignorance, or doubt his veracity? But it is even so; he knows no more of the history which he quotes with so much parade, than bishop Warburton knew of Amadis or Palmerin; with <HI>either of which</HI> the story of <HI>Oliver the Paladin</HI> has just as much con∣nection as it has with the history of <HI>Oliver of Castile and Arthur of Algarbe.</HI> With respect to the above French and Spanish titles, they are literally transcribed from Fresnoy. And so much for <HI>dr. Percys</HI> acquaintance with old ro∣mances.</P>

<P>And at our <HI>stamp</HI> here o'er and o'er one falls.</P>
</SP>
<P>Dr. Johnson labours hard to prove this to be a vicious reading: "Fairies, says he, are never represented stamp∣ing,
<PB N="45" REF="54"/>or of a size that should give force to a stamp, nor could they have distinguished the stamps of such from those of their own companions." He, therefor, reads:
<Q>And at a <HI>stump</HI> here o'er and o'er one falls.</Q></P>
<P>To prove, however, that Fairies <HI>could stamp,</HI> mr. Stee∣vens produces a passage from Olaus Wormius. He need not have gone so much out of his way: honest Reginald Scot could have informed him, that our "grandams maides were woont to set a boll of milke before 'Incubus' and his cousine Robin good-fellow, for grinding of malt or mustard, and sweeping the house at midnight: and....that he would chase exceedingly, if the maid or good-wife of the house, hauing compassion of his nakednes, laid anie clothes for him, beesides his messe of white bread and milke, which was his standing see.

</SP>
<P>The folio reads:
<Q><L>Then know that I <HI>one</HI> Snug the joiner am</L>
<L>A lion fell nor else no lions dam.</L></Q></P>
<P>This (<HI>i. e. A</HI> lion fell), says mr. Steevens, not agree∣ing with the remainder of the speech, the modern editors have altered it into—<HI>no</HI> lion fell. Had they, continues he, consulted the quarto, 1600, it would have set them right.</P>
<Q><L>Then know that I, <HI>as</HI> Snug the joyner, am</L>
<L>A lion fell, nor else no lyons dam.</L></Q>
<P>A reading which this ingenious gentleman has accord∣ingly adopted. It is, nevertheless, certainly wrong, and that of the folio is certainly right.</P>
<P>At the rehearsal of the play, lest "the ladies should be afear'd of the lion," being, as Bottom observes, "the most fearful wild fowl living," it was settled, that there should be a prologue to tell, that Snug, who was to perform this terrible part, was <HI>not</HI> a lion; his name was, likewise, to be named, and half his face seen through the lions neck; through which he was, moreover, to speak, "saying thus, or to this defect,—Ladies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> If you think I come hither <HI>as a lion,</HI> it were pity of my life: no, I am <HI>no such thing; I am a man as other men are:"</HI>—and there, indeed, he was "to name his name; and tell them plainly he 'was' Snug the joiner." This prologue he is now delivering; but the passage must be read and pointed thus; the sense and mean∣ing being strangely misconceived and misrepresented by the present editors:
<Q><L>Then know, that I one Snug the joiner am;</L>
<L>A lion fell nor else no lions dam:</L>
<L>For if I should as lion come in strife</L>
<L>Into this place, 'twere pity of my life.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="58"/>
That is, I am neither <HI>lion</HI> nor <HI>lioness,</HI> I am <HI>Snug the joiner.</HI> The text makes him declare that he <HI>is</HI> a lion, or comes <HI>as</HI> a lion, which is utterly inconsistent with the rest of his speech; defeats the very end and design of his prologue; and would have been enough ("God shield us!") to scare the ladies out of their wits. The use of the sing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e negative with a double aspect is common with our author and other ancient writers. Thus Fletcher, in his animated apostrophe to the memory of Spenser:
<Q><L>O may that man that hath the Muses scorn'd,</L>
<L>Alive <HI>nor</HI> dead be ever of a Muse adorn'd
<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">(7) Instead of <HI>ever,</HI> a late editor of Spenser, not so intimate, perhaps, with the language of his author, and his contemporaties, as he ought to have been, proposes to read <HI>never.</HI></NOTE>.</L></Q></P>
<P>The conclusion is, that "the modern editors," who read <HI>no,</HI> were perfectly right, in point of construction, though the alteration was unnecessary and improper.</P>

</SP>
<P><HI>Use</HI> and <HI>usance,</HI> mr. Steevens says, are both words anci∣ently employed for <HI>usury.</HI> And, to justify the explanation, he quotes the two following passages from an old play:
<Q><L>Give me my <HI>use,</HI> give me my principal.</L>
<L>A toy; the main about five hundred pounds,</L>
<L>And the <HI>use</HI> fifty.</L></Q></P>
<P>But, after all, is he not mistaken? <HI>Use</HI> and <HI>usance</HI> mean nothing more than <HI>interest.</HI> And the former word is still used by country people in the same sense. His own authorities prove this to be the ancient meaning. <HI>Give me my</HI> interest, <HI>give me my principal.

<P>The distinction between <HI>boy</HI> and <HI>son,</HI> dr. Johnson sagaciously remarks, is obvious, but <HI>child,</HI> adds he, seems to have had some meaning which is now lost. Mr. Stee∣vens supposes that, by <HI>your child that shall be,</HI> he means that his duty to his father should in future shew him to be his child. There is not the least difficulty in the passage. Launcelot is talking nonsense, or, as the vulgar have it, putting the cart before the horse; but whether designedly or not is left to the contemplation of the critics.

<L>— thou shalt not <HI>gormandize</HI></L>
<L>As thou hast done with me.</L>
</SP>
<P>"The word [<HI>gormandize</HI>] is very ancient, and took its rise from a Danish king. The Danes, towards the latter end of the ninth century, were defeated by king Alfred at Edendon in Wiltshire; and as an article of peace, Guth∣rum their king, commonly called Gurmond, submitted to be baptized, king Alfred being his godfather, who gave him the name of Athelstan, and took him for his adopted
<PB N="52" REF="61"/>son. During the stay of the Danes in Wiltshire, "they consumed their time in profuseness, and belly-cheer, in idleness and sloth. Insomuch, that as from their laziness in general, we, e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en to this day, call them <HI>Lur-Danes;</HI> so from the licentiousness of Gurmond, and his army in par∣ticular, we brand all luxuricus and profuse people, by the name of <HI>Gurmondizers.</HI>" And this luxury, and this lazi∣ness, are the sole monuments, the only memorials by which the Danes have made themselves notorious to pos∣terity, by being encamped in Wiltshire. Vide, <HI>A Vindi∣cation of Stone-Heng restored,</HI> by John Webb, esq. p. 227. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Jonson in his <HI>Sejanus,</HI> act. I.</P>

<P>After such a pompous display of learning, so strangely in∣troduced into the margin of Shakspeare, how will this mr. G.

<P>How others have misunderstood Anthonios terms, does not by this edition appear, and it might be policy in dr.

Anthonio tells the duke, that, if he will abate the fine for the states half, he (An∣thonio) will be contented to take the other, <HI>in trust,</HI> after Shylocks death, to render it to his daughters husband.

<P>"Though I would not often assume the critics privi∣lege of being confident where certainty cannot be obtained, nor indulge myself too far in departing from the established reading; yet I cannot but propose the rejection of this pas∣sage, which I believe was an insertion of some player, that having so much learning as to discover to what Shak∣speare alluded, was not willing that his audience should be less knowing than himself, and has therefore weakened the
<PB N="73" REF="82"/>authours sense, by the intrusion of a remote and useless image into a speech bursting from a man wholly possessed with his own present condition, and therefore not at leisure to explain his allusions to himself. If these words are taken away, by which not only the thought but the numbers are injured, the lines of Shakespeare close together without any traces of a break.</P>

<P>This note, dr. Johnson tells us, was written before he was fully acquainted with Shakspeares manner, and he does not now think it of so much weight: why did he then reprint it? because the words which he once thought interpolated by the players, he now thinks to have been interpolated by the author. But there never was surely such a number of words wasted to such an idle purpose. Whether Mac∣beth would have made use of the image is not the question: the words are as evidently Shakspeares as any others in the play. And where was the necessity of so much <HI>learning</HI> to discover the allusion? The idea was persectly familiar to him. He got it from the old translation of Plutarch, and has particularly dwelled upon it in <HI>Ant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny and Cleopatra,</HI> act II. scene iii.</P>

<P>The <HI>shard-born</HI> beetle is, perhaps, the beetle <HI>born</HI> among <HI>shards,</HI> i. e.

</SP>
<P>The meaning of this abrupt dialogue, dr. Johnson ob∣serves, is this: the <HI>perfect spy,</HI> mentioned by Macbeth in the foregoing scene, has, before they enter upon the stage, given them the directions which were promised at the time of their agreement; yet one of the murderers suborned,
<PB N="75" REF="84"/>suspects him of intending to betray them; the other ob∣serves, that, by his exact knowledge of <HI>what they were to do,</HI> he appears to be employed by Macbeth, and needs not be mistrusted. A comment which there are sew besides the learned author that would not have been ashamed to re∣peat.</P>
<P>In the preceding scene, Macbeth says to the two first murderers.
<Q><L>I will advise you where to plant yourselves;</L>
<L>Acquaint you with <HI>the</HI> perfect spy o'the time,</L>
<L>The moment on't.</L></Q> <HI>i. e.</HI> the very time when you are to look out for him. But dr. Johnson has changed it to
<Q><HI>A</HI> perfect spy o'the time,</Q> and seems too consident or too careless to perceive the ab∣surdity he introduces. For, if Macbeth had made the two first murderers acquainted with this <HI>perfect spy</HI> of dr. John∣son, and they had received their directions from him, how could the first murderer possibly ask him <HI>who</HI> bid him join them?—O, but, says the learned critic, he suspects him of an intention to betray them. Betray them! To whom? To Banquo? To be sure they had wonderful cause to be afraid of one whom the king hisself had appointed them to kill!—The fact plainly is, that this additional or supernumerary villain is sent from Mac∣beth, by way of reinforcement, after the others had taken their stand. He has told them that he was acquainted with the design, but one of them, being unwilling, it should seem, to admit a third to participate in the reward, and therefor desirous to shuffle him off, very naturally asks, who bid <HI>him</HI> join them.</P>

</SP>
<P>"It must be owned," says dr. Warburton, "that Shak∣speare is often guilty of some strange absurdities in point of history and chronology: yet here he has artfully avoided one. He had a mind to hint, that the cure of the <HI>evil</HI> was to descend to the successors in the royal line in compliment to James the first. But the Consessor was the first who pre∣tended to the gift: how then could it be at that time ge∣nerally spoken of, that the gift was hereditary? this he has solved by telling us that Edward had the gift of prophecy along with it."</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="86"/>
"The ingenious editor of the <HI>Houshold Book</HI> of <HI>the Fifth Earle of Northumberland,</HI> dr. Percy," adds mr. Steevens, "very acutely observes on the subject of cramp rings, "that the miraculous gift of curing the <HI>evil</HI> was left to be claimed by the Stuarts; our ancient Plantagenets were humbly con∣tent to cure the <HI>cramp."</HI></P>
<P>There may be a vast fund of <HI>acuteness,</HI> but there is not a tittle of <HI>truth</HI> or <HI>knowlege</HI> in this ingenious observation. It is so well known that not onely the <HI>Tudor</HI> family, but their predecessors, for many ages, exercised this real or imaginary power, that, in the reign of queen Elizabeth, who <HI>touched</HI> often, as any old history, and many other books, will inform us, one William Tooker, a learned divine, pub∣lished a laborious Latin treatise upon the subject, in which he enumerates a number of <HI>cures</HI> performed by that princess, and others of our ancient English monarchs
<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">(9) See much curious information on this subject in the reverend dr.

With re∣spect to dr. Warburton, one would be glad to know, how he became so certain that Edward the Confessor was the first who pretended to this gift. Shakspeare may be sometimes chargeable with great absurdities, but he rarely, if ever, commits such a one as his over∣learned commentator would here force upon him. If <HI>Edward the Consessor</HI> had been the <HI>first</HI> English monarch possessed of this <HI>hereditary faculty,</HI> it must necessaryly have <HI>dyed with him,</HI> for he not onely was a <HI>usurper,</HI> but <HI>left no issue.</HI> So that king James neither did, nor possibly could either <HI>claim</HI> or <HI>get</HI> it from <HI>him.</HI> And his real titles were too

<P>"It <HI>appears,</HI>" says mr. Steevens, in a note upon this pas∣sage, "from dr.

<Q>king James VI. thought it necessary to form an act against superfluous banquetting.</Q></P>
<P>It is a pity that the ingenious commentator has omitted the very candid and liberal inference which the great tra∣veler draws from the above circumstance of the kail, <HI>i. e.</HI> that, "when they had not <HI>that,</HI> they had <HI>nothing."</HI></P>
<P>But under the favour of this ingenious critic, it does <HI>not appear:</HI>—dr. Johnson, indeed, is pleased to <HI>say so,</HI> and they who would have believed him if he had given a rela∣tion
<PB N="79" REF="88"/>of his voyage into the moon, may, if they choose, believe this. It is very seldom that we find people teach∣ing to others arts of which they are ignorant theirselves, and yet this must have been the case with Cromwells sol∣diers; who were accustomed neither to eat kail, nor to wear brogues. The truth is, that both articles have, in all probability, been known to the Scotish ever since the country was inhabited. So that they may safely admit the truth of the above very candid travelers good-natured posi∣tion.</P>
<P>Mr. Steevens seems to think it altogether needless to re∣strain luxury in diet, where people could get neither <HI>kail</HI> nor <HI>brogues;</HI> which, to be sure, are the very essence of a sump∣tuous feast.</P>

<P>For this nonsense the reader is indebted to dr. Johnsons <HI>emendation;</HI> the old copies have it thus:
<Q><HI>Is</HI> not amiss when it is truly done.</Q> Which dr. Warburton calls the conclusion <HI>de travers:</HI> he therefor reads:

<P><PB N="82" REF="91"/>
But all these objections to, and proposed alterations of the old reading, arise entirely from its not being under∣stood. If the reader will consider the passage a moment, he will perceive that it has sense and meaning,—is quite in the spirit of the cardinals quibbling logic,—and infinitely superior to any of these pretended emendations. Pandulf, having conjured the king to perform his first vow to hea∣ven,—to be champion of the church,—tells him, that what he has since sworn is sworn against hisself, and therefor may not be performed by him: for <HI>that,</HI> says he, which you have sworn to <HI>do amiss,</HI> is <HI>not amiss</HI> (i. e. becomes right) when it is <HI>done truely</HI> (that is, as he explains it, not done at all); and being <HI>not done,</HI> where it would be a <HI>sin</HI> to <HI>do it,</HI> the <HI>truth</HI> is <HI>most done</HI> when you <HI>do it not.</HI></P>

<P>Dr. Johnson here takes an opportunity to censure Shak∣speare for deserting the manners of the age in which his drama is placed:—this weapon, he says, not being seen in England till two centuries aftewards. It would be as well, however, though not quite so easy, for the learned critic to bring some proof in support of this and such like assertions. Without which the authority of Shakspeare is at least equal to that of dr. Johnson. And, even if he could prove what he asserts (which, however, it is believed he cannot), the poets friends would still have an argument which would render both his assertions and his proofs equally nugatory and ridi∣culous.</P>

<L>No more the <HI>thirsty entrance of this soil</HI></L>

</SP>
<P>Dr. Warburton calls these lines nonsense, and would read <HI>trempe</HI> instead of <HI>daub,</HI> or, as it stood then, <HI>damp.</HI> Dr. Johnson allows them to be absurd, but objects to <HI>trempe,</HI> and would change <HI>entrance</HI> to <HI>entrails,</HI> adding that the relative <HI>her</HI> is inaccurately used in both readings. He is likewise willing to suppose a verse lost. Mr. Steevens,
<PB N="88" REF="97"/>not being satisfyed with either alteration, proposes <HI>entrants</HI> instead of <HI>entrance,</HI> and explains it by, "those who set foot on this kingdom through the lust of power or con∣quest (which was the kings own case)." Never sure was there so much <HI>drumbleing,</HI> nor (except in this edition) were there ever so many wild and absurd conjectures, as this simple passage has given rise to. For so simple it cer∣tainly is, as that the little meaning it has may be easyly discovered by the most ignorant; however <HI>doctors</HI> may differ about it. The <HI>thirsty entrance of the soil</HI> is nothing more or less than the face of the earth, parched and cracked as it always appears in a dry summer; and mr. Steevens came nearer the mark than he was aware of when he men∣tioned the <HI>persus surface</HI> of the ground. As to its being personifyed, it is, certainly, no such unusual practice with Shakspeare. Every one talks familarly of <HI>mother Earth;</HI> and they who live upon her face may, without much im∣propriety, be called her children. Our author onely confines the image to his own country.

<L>As the honey of Hybla, my <HI>old lad of the castle.</HI></L>
</SP>
<P>There is a very old and popular tradition that <HI>old lad of the castle</HI> alludes to the name of Sir John <HI>Oldcastle,</HI> Fal∣staffs original surname, when this play was first performed. This mr. Steevens will by no means allow. But it is no matter; there is as much reason, argument, and authority, as can be well expected on one side of the question, and his bare opinion on the other. Fuller, beside the words cited in the note, has, in his <HI>Worthies,</HI> p. 253, the following passage:</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="98"/>
"Sir John <HI>Oldcastle</HI> was first made a <HI>thrasonical puff,</HI> an emblem of <HI>mock valour,</HI> a make sport in all <HI>plays</HI> for a <HI>coward.</HI>"</P>
<P>Speed, likewise, in his Chronicle, edit. 2. p. 178, says:</P>
<P>"The author of the <HI>Three Conversions</HI> [i. e. Parsons, the Jesuit] hath made <HI>Oldcastle</HI> a ruffian, a robber, and a rebel, and his authority, taken from the <HI>stage-playe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> is more befitting the pen of his slandcrous report, than the credit of the judicious, being only grounded from the papist and the poet, of like conscience for lies, the one ever seign∣ing, and the other ever falsifying the truth."
<NOTE N="11" PLACE="foot">(11) Both these quotations are immediately taken from an old number of the <HI>Gentlemans Magazine.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>It is somewhat extraordinary for mr. Steevens to assert that Shakspeare was not the author of the old play of Hen. V. in which Oldcastle appears to have been first intro∣duced upon the stage. No body ever said or thought he was. But the very ingenious critic knows, and allows; that this same play afforded Shakspeare several hints; among which were the name and character of <HI>Sir John Oldcastle,</HI> whom he, afterwards, upon better advice, called Sir John <HI>Falst<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ff.</HI></P>

<P>It was not, says mr. Steevens, Edmund Earl of March, the Mortimer of this play, whom K. Richard II. pro∣claimed heir to the crown; but his father Roger earl of March, who was killed soon after in Ireland.</P>

<P>That Roger Mortimer could not be <HI>then</HI> proclaimed heir to the crown is evident, from this plain and simple circum∣stance:—He was not then alive. He had been treache∣rously killed by the wild Irish; and it was chiefly to revenge his death that the king set out on this very expe∣dition. This proves it could not be <HI>Roger;</HI> and that it was <HI>Edmund,</HI> is proved by Hall, who expressly says, that HE, ("Edmond, sonne to erle Roger") "at kyng Richardes goyng into Ireland was proclaimed heire apparant to the crowne and realme."</P>

Mr. Steevens half-doubts the propriety of this explanation, and supposes the expression may mean <HI>fleas resembling a loach</HI> (i. e. the fish so called). They must have been <HI>elephantine∣lops,</HI> indeed, to do this, the loach being two or three

The allusion is doubtless to the above <HI>fish;</HI> and mr.

Dr. Watbur∣tons explanation, if it may be so miscalled, is almost too ab∣surd to deserve contradiction.

<P>This he pronounces to be absurd; and therefor alters the passage as above; with very little reason, and against all authority. The modern editors, noticing an omission, make Bardolph to enter with Gadshill. The learned critic calls this a countenancing of the impropriety, and, therefor,

The player editors divided the different dramas just as they were <HI>broken in the representation.</HI> And, most, if not all, of Shakspeares plays having been performed at his own theatre, and under his own eye, it is very improbable that he should not have given directions about the division of the acts. If there had been no distinction of acts in the playhouse copies, messieurs Hemings and Condell would never have troubled their heads about the matter. No edi∣tor has therefor any right to alter that division which is established by the two first folios: unless in two or three places where the misplacing of the <HI>actus</HI> is too glaringly absurd to admit a doubt of its impropriety.</P>

<P>The fact is, that, in the folio, it is the <HI>duke of Exeter,</HI> and not Eluellen, who enters, and to whom Pistol addresses hisself. Shakspeare had made the alteration, and the

<P>The poet, says Theobald, might intend, "take from them the sense of reckoning those opposed numbers; <HI>which</HI> might pluck their courage from them." But the <HI>relative,</HI> adds he, not being expressed, the sense is very obscure.</P>
<P>This change, according to dr. Johnson, is rightly ad∣mitted by bishop Warburton. Sir Thomas Hanmer, it seems, reads:
<Q><L>— the opposed numbers</L>
<L>Which stand before them.</L></Q></P>
<P>This reading, dr. Johnson says, he borrowed from the old quarto, which gives the passage thus:
<Q><L>Take from them now the sense of reckoning,</L>
<L>That the opposed multitudes that stand before them</L>
<L>May not appall their courage.</L></Q></P>
<P>Mr. Tyrwhitt allows that Theobalds alteration makes a very good sense; but he thinks that we might read, with

<P>After all, the old reading appears to be right; though none of the commentators has attempted to explain it.

The first part of dr. Warburtons note is singularly just. It is, indeed, a mockery of Heaven in Henry to expect pardon for a crime of which he continued to enjoy the benefit.

<P>Mr. Steevens believes that <HI>trull</HI> did not anciently bear so harsh an interpretation as it does at present. An opinion for which the learned commentator does not seem to have suf∣ficient authority. In Shakspeares time, and long before, it signifyed a <HI>strumpet,</HI> a <HI>harlot,</HI> as it evidently does in the text. Neither will the single instance brought by mr.
<PB N="114" REF="123"/>Steevens prove the contrary. In the ancient morality of <HI>The iiij elements,</HI> a fellow says:
<Q><L>For to satisfy your wanton lust</L>
<L>I shall apoynt you a <HI>trull</HI> of trust,</L>
<L>Nor a fairer in this towne.</L></Q></P>
<P>Again, in the old mayg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me of <HI>Robin Hode:</HI>
<Q>She is a <HI>trul</HI> of trust, to ferve a fryer at his lust.</Q></P>
<P>It is to be regretted that Shakspeare should have so far fol∣lowed the absurd and lying stories of his time, about this celebrated heroine, whom the French called the maid of God, as to represent her not onely a strumpet, but a witch. If we may believe the most authentic historians she was no less distinguished for virtue than courage. She was burnt, indeed, by the barbarous English, whom she had so fre∣quently driven before her, and who, to excuse their want of courage or policy, and to justify their inhumanity, pre∣tended that she had dealt with the devil! But her memory will, no doubt, be long held in deserved veneration by her grateful countrymen, whom she so largely contributed to rescue from usurpation and slavery. And it is not the least praise of our elegant historian, mr. Hume, that he has en∣deavoured to do justice to the much injured character of this amiable, brave, wise, and patriotic female.</P>
<P>The dauphin, too, whom we are apt to look upon as a traitor, a coward, and a scoundrel, was, perhaps, the greatest character of the age he lived in. He was one of the best kings France ever had, and England never had a better.</P>

<P>The truth of this charge should have been established by some better authority than the dictum of mr. Edwards, adopted by mr. Steevens. In the third year of Henry the sixth (1425), and during the time that Peter duke of Coimbra was entertained in London, "Edmonde Mortymer," says Hall, "the last erle of Marche of that name (which longe tyme had bene restrayned frō hys liberty, and fynally waxed lame) disceased wythout yssue, whose inheritance discended to lord Richard Plantagenet, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>"</P>

Dr. Johnson thought this plau∣sible enough, but would rather have the speech (corrupted further) broken thus:—<HI>And if—I wish—he did,</HI> or, per∣haps: <HI>And if he did, I wish.</HI> Such nonsense as no one but dr. Johnson would have been confident enough to pro∣duce; and which not even dr. Johnson could understand. To mr.

But it is really astonishing that men of so much learn∣ing, sense, and sagacity, for they certainly have in many places displayed a great deal of each, should so grossly misconceive the meaning of so plain and simple a passage. York says, he is not pleased that the king should prefer
<PB N="117" REF="126"/>the <HI>red rose,</HI> the badge of Somerset, his enemy; Warwick desires him not to be offended at it, as he dares say the king <HI>meant no harm.</HI> To which York, yet unsatisfyed, hastyly adds, in a menacing tone,—<HI>If I thought he did</HI> —but he instantly checks his threat with—<HI>let it rest.</HI> It is an example of a rhetorical figure which every one knows, and which our author has elsewhere used.

<P>If the passage would not have explained itsself, one should think that Exeters soliloquy, immediately following Yorks speech, might have served to do it.</P>
<P>It is but justice to say that the truely ingenious author of the <HI>Revisal</HI> understood this passage in the same manner; and the neglect he has received at the hands of the late editors who have made little other use of his book than merely to pick out a few conjectures to cavil at, does no more credit to them, than it has done service to their author.</P>

There can be no better evidence that Shakspeare was entirely unacquainted with the game of chess than his not having (at least to the writers remem∣brance) the most distant allusion to it.

This, says mr. Theobald, is king Henrys reply to his wife Margaret. There can be no reason, adds he, why the king should forget his own wises name, and call her Nell instead of Margaret. As the change of a single letter, he thought, set all right, he was willing to suppose it came from his pen thus:
<Q>I thank thee. <HI>Well,</HI> these words content me much.</Q> And this the editors have adopted without further en∣quiry. That the queens name was <HI>Margaret</HI> and not <HI>Eleanor</HI> is an allowed fact. But that the king should for∣get it is not at all surprising, as, in the progress of the scene, we find, that she forgets it <HI>herself,</HI> calling herself <HI>Eleanor</HI> no less than three times in one speech. Of this, however, it should seem that mr. Theobald has not taken any notice: at least none is taken of it in this edition, which every where reads <HI>Margaret.</HI> The change in the three instances alluded to was certainly requisite: and the same necessity and the same reasoning which displaced <HI>Eleanor</HI> and inserted <HI>Margaret,</HI> must, in the passage under consideration, displace <HI>Nell</HI> and insert <HI>Meg.</HI></P>

<P>This circumstance is not warranted by history.

<P>Isabel dutchess of Burgundy, whom Shakspeare calls the dukes aunt, was daughter of John I. king of Portugal, by Philippa of Lancaster, eldest daughter of John of Gaunt. They were, therefor, no more than third cousins.</P>

<P><HI>A field of battle,</HI> at Ferrybridge <HI>in Yorkshire.</HI>] We should read <HI>near Towton,</HI> Shakspeare has here, perhaps inten∣tionally, thrown three different actions into one. The lord Fitz-water, being stationed by king Edward to defend the pass of Ferrybridge, was assaulted by the lord Clifford, and immediately slain, "and with hym," says Hall, "the hastard of Salisbury, brother to the earl of Warwycke, a valeaunt yong gen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elman, and of great audicitie. When the earl of Warwycke," adds he, "was informed of this seate, he lyke a man desperated, mounted on his hackeney, and came blowing to kyng Edwarde saiyng: syr I praye God haue mercy of their soules, which in the beginning of your enterprise hath lost their lyfes, and because I se no succors of the world I remit the vengeaunce and punish∣ment to God our creator and redenier, and with that lighted doune, and slewe his horse with his swourde, saiyng: let them flye that wyl, for surely I wil tary with him that wil tary with me, and kissed the crosse of his swourde." Clifford in his retreat was beset with a party of Yorkists, when, "eyther," says the historian, "for heat or payne putting off his gerget sodainly with an arrowe (as some say) without an hedde [he] was striken into the throte, and incontinent rendered his spirite, and the erle of Westmerlandes brother, and almost all his company were thare slayn, at a place called Dinting-dale, not farr frō Towton." In the afternoon of the next day (Palm Sunday eve, 1461), on a plain field between Towton and Saxton, joined the main battles,
<PB N="128" REF="137"/>which continued engaged that night and the greater part of the following day: upwards of 30,000 men, all English (including many of the nobility and the flower of the gentry, especially of the northern parts) being slain, on both sides. This battle, says Carte, "decided the fate of the house of Lancaster, overturning, in one day, an usurpation strengthened by sixty-two years continuance: and esta∣blished Edward on the throne of England."</P>

<P>Shakspeare is not singular in supposing Henry to be the true representative of the line of Lancaster. The tyrannous and bloody disposition of this monarch, and his immediate successor (neither of whom was at all inferior in cruelty, and the first of them far superior in craft and cunning to the monster he dethroned), joined to the goodness of their title under the house of York, made it unsafe, and perhaps unnecessary to canvas his descent. So that fear, flattery, neglect, and ignorance, seem to have established the opi∣nion which most of our historians, and people in general hold of Richmonds being what he here pretends to be. But he is an impostor: his great grandfather, John duke of Somerset, from whom he derived the little title he had, was bastard son to John of Gaunt, and, though legitimated by act of parliament as to other purposes, utterly incapable of inheriting the crown. The right heir of the house of Lancaster, which, indeed, as opposed to the line of York, had not the smallest legal pretensions to the throne, was
<PB N="138" REF="147"/>then, and still is, in the royal family of Portugal, in virtue of its descent from the lady Philippa, eldest daughter to John of Gaunt.</P>

This, to be sure, is one way for an editor to get rid of difficulties—by transferring them to his readers. The pre∣sent instance, however, fortunately happens to be none. The most sovereign prescription in Galen, says Menenius, is, to this news, but <HI>empiricutic:</HI>—an adjective evidently formed by the author from <HI>empiric</HI> (<HI>empirique,</HI> F.) a quack.</P>

<P>"Of this tragedy," dr. Johnson says, "many parti∣cular passages deserve regard ..... but I have never been strongly agitated in perusing it, and think it somewhat cold and unaffecting, <HI>&amp;c."</HI></P>
<P>This is a strange charge. If nature have denyed to this great critic the ordinary feelings of humanity, is he there∣for to accuse the poet? Surely, dr. Johnson is the onely person living who would not be ashamed to declare hisself
<PB N="146" REF="155"/>insensible to the interesting and pathetic scenes of this ad∣mirable drama. So far from Shakspeares adherence "to the real story and to Roman manners" having "impeded the natural vigour of his genius," he seems to have risen with the grandeur and importance of his subject; and, if there be any one play in these volumes which affects the heart more than the rest it may be safely averred to be this of Julius Caesar. And he who is not "agitated in perusing it" may defy the powers of poetry to move him.</P>
<P>The characters or dogmatical criticisms subjoined by the above learned philosopher at the end of each play are gene∣rally (as in the present instance) as unjust in theirselves, as injurious to the immortal author; and, in many cases, could onely proceed from one who either had not read the drama reviewed, or, from some natural defect, was insen∣sible of its beauty and merit.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Seyward,</HI> says dr. Johnson, in his preface to Beau∣mont, has very elaborately endeavoured to prove that an <HI>arm-gaunt</HI> steed is a steed with <HI>lean-shoulders. Arm,</HI> adds he, is the Teutonic word for <HI>want,</HI> or <HI>poverty. "Arm gaunt</HI> may be therefore an old word, signifying <HI>lean</HI> for <HI>want,</HI> ill-fed. Edwards's observation, that a worn out horse is not proper for Atlas to mount in battle, is impertinent: the horse here mentioned seems to be a post-horse, rather than a war∣horse."</P>
<P>It is somewhat remarkable that when this great critic is desirous to introduce his own note on a passage whereon a much better has been already written, he ge∣nerally begins his observation by ridiculing that of his predecessor. Mr. Seward, (not <HI>Seyward</HI> as dr. John∣son, mr. Steevens, and mr. Malone, have every where
<PB N="148" REF="157"/>throughout this edition corrupted his name) explains the word <HI>arm-gaunt</HI> by <HI>thin shoulders,</HI> which, he says, is known to be one of the principal beauties of a horse. And he adds that the epithet has, from the uncommon use of either part of the compound word in this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ense, an <HI>antique dignity</HI> and grandeur in sound that poets much delight in. (The reader will observe the difference between <HI>thin shoulders</HI> and <HI>lean shoulders;</HI> the former being a beauty, the latter a defect.) And this dr. Johnson calls an <HI>elaborate endeavour to prove.</HI> Not recollecting that his own attempt is more elaborate, and much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss ingenious and successful. <HI>Arm</HI> may be the Teu∣toni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> word for want; and yet one would like to have some better proof of its existence than the bare dictum of one so little acquainted with ancient languages as dr. Johnson is. And even when that is given we should still be glad to know how Shakspeare came by it. Dr. Johnsons observation that this steed was a post horse is "impertinent;" as a post∣horse would scareely have made any distinction between Antony and his groom: and yet the author represents it so proud of its burthen that its neigh silenced the by-standers.</P>

<P><HI>Scene II.</HI> — <HI>Enter Poet and Painter.</HI>] "The Poet and the Painter were within view when Apemantus parted from Timon, and might then have seen Timon, since Apemantus, standing by him could see them: But the scenes of the thieves and steward have passed before their arrival, and yet passed, as the drama is now con∣ducted, within their view. It might be suspected, that some scenes are transposed, for all these difficulties would be removed by introducing the Poet and Painter first, and the thieves in this place. Yet I am afraid the scenes must keep their present order; for the Painter alludes to
<PB N="155" REF="164"/>the thieves when he says, <HI>he likewise enriched poor strag∣gling soldiers with great quantity.</HI> This impropriety is now heightened by placing the thieves in one act, and the Poet and Painter in another: but it must be remem∣bered, that in the original edition this play is not divided into separate acts, so that the present distribution is arbi∣trary, and may be changed if any convenience can be gained, or impropriety obviated by alteration. JOHNSON."</P>
<P>Had the learned critic perused the small remainder of the Painters speech, he would have perceived another incongruity, of which he does not seem to be aware. In the immediately preceding scene (the first of the fifth act) Flavius, Timons steward, has a conference with his master, and receives gold from him. Between this and the present scene, a single minute cannot be supposed to pass; and yet the Painter tells his companion:—<HI>'tis said, he gave</HI> his steward a <HI>mighty sum.</HI> Where was it said? Why in Athens, whence, it must therefor seem, they are but newly come. <HI>Here</HI> then should be fixed the commencement of the <HI>fifth act,</HI> in order to allow time for Flavius to return to the city, and for rumour to publish his adventure with Timon. But how are we, in this case, to account for Apemantuses announcing the approach of the Poet and Painter in the last scene of the preceding act, and before the thieves appear? It is possible that, when this play was abridged for representation, all be∣tween this passage and the entrance of the Poet and Painter, may have been omitted by the players, and these words put into the mouth of Apemantus to introduce them: and that when it was published at large, the interpolation was un∣noticed. Or, if we allow the Poet and the Painter to see Apemantus, it may be conjectured that they did not think his presence necessary at their interview with Timon, and had therefor returned back into the city.</P>

<L>By all description this should be the place.</L>
<L>Who's here? speak, ho!—No answer?—What is this?</L>
<L>Timon is dead, who hath out-firetch'd his span:</L>
<L><HI>Some beast read this;</HI> there does not live a man.</L>
<L>Dead sure; and this his grave. What's on this tomb?</L>
<L>I cannot read; the character I'll take with wax.</L>
</SP>
<P>Dr. Warburton proposes <HI>rear'd</HI> for <HI>read,</HI> and says, that the soldier had onely seen the rude heap of earth. But dr. Johnson, who seems to have thought, that the chief part of his busy∣ness consisted in a <HI>totis viribus</HI> opposition to the most judi∣cious improvements of preceding commentators, and that there is as much honour to be got by the demolition, as by the erection, of an elegant structure, observes that the soldier "had evidently seen something that told him <HI>Timon was dead;</HI> and what could tell that but his tomb? The tomb he sees, and the inscription upon it, which not being able to read, and finding none to read it for him, he ex∣claims peevishly, <HI>some beast read this,</HI> for it must be read, and in this place it cannot be read by man."</P>
<P>Now with all proper deserence to the misunderstanding and confusion under which the learned critic labours in the above note, it is evident that the soldier, when he first sees the heap of earth does not know it to be a <HI>tomb.</HI> He con∣cludes that Timon must be dead, because he receives <HI>no an∣swer.</HI> It is likewise evident that when he utters the words <HI>some beast, &amp;c.</HI> he has <HI>not</HI> seen the inscription. And dr. Warburtons emendation is therefor not onely just and happy, but absolutely necessary. <HI>What can this heap of earth be?</HI> says the soldier. — <HI>Timon is certainly dead, some beast must have</HI> erected <HI>this for here does not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive a man to do it,—Yes, he is dead, sure enough, and</HI> this must be his grave. What is this writing upon it?</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="166"/>
Dr. Johnson is not content with representing the soldier as peevish; he makes him a perfect fool. For thus, ac∣cording to the sagacious commentators exposition, will his soliloquy stand:—<HI>I cannot read these letters; I must get</HI> some beast <HI>to</HI> read them for me; <HI>for, read they must be; and read, in this place, they cannot be, by man!</HI> But, first, where was the so urgent necessity of the inscription being read at all? and, secondly, why could <HI>no man</HI> read it where it was?</P>

<P>This passage convinces mr. Steevens, that this play was the work of one conversant with the Greek tragedies in their original language; and, therefor, not of Shakspeare. "We have here," says he, "a plain allusion to the <HI>Ajax</HI> of Sophocles, of which no translation was extant in the time of Shakspeare." If the fact were true, of which, however, neither mr. Steevens, nor any man now living can be cer∣tain
<NOTE N="18" PLACE="foot">(18) Theobald has supposed a passage in this play to have been gleaned from the Hecuba of Euripides. But, says mr. Steevens, upon that occasion, "mr. Theobald should first have proved to us that our author understood Greek, or else that this play of Euripides had been translated. In the mean time because neither of these particulars are verified, we may as well suppose he took it from the old story book of the Trojan war, or the old translation of Ovid." Why should mr. Steevens require a proof from Theobald of a cir∣cumstance which he hisself here assumes as a matter of fact?</NOTE>, numbers of printed tracts, and even large vo∣lumes, having perished since that period, as accidents and
<PB N="158" REF="167"/>the researches of antiquarians dayly prove, still Shakspeare might have been indebted for the circumstance to some manuscript version, or the information of a more learned friend. Or (as is very probable) the same allusion may be contained in other old books. There are many expressions in the course of the play which do not prove the author to have been very familiar with the ancients. Among other instances which might be adduced, Marcus praises Lavinia for her excellent performance on the <HI>lute.</HI> And it will not be very easy to decide whether the characters, or, at least, the times are Christian or Heathen.</P>

<P>The folio and quarto editions, it seems, read <HI>brooch,</HI> which leads dr. Johnson to think the meaning equivalent to one of Achilles' <HI>hangers</HI>-on. Mr. Malone, who, it must be confessed, generally comes foreward to a very good or useful purpose, observes that <HI>Brooch</HI> had some meaning at present unknown. For, says he, in the following passage
<PB N="160" REF="169"/>in Lodges <HI>Rosalynde,</HI> 1592, it seems to signify something very different from a <HI>pin</HI> or a <HI>bodkin:</HI> "His bonnet was green, whereon stood a copper <HI>brooch</HI> with the picture of St. Dennis." A <HI>brooch</HI> is an <HI>ornament;</HI> likewise a <HI>buckle</HI> of uncommon workmanship, for the hat or breast. Such a one as had an image or figure of St. Dennis upon it, would probably conceal the pin or prong, which kept it fast to the hat or girdle. K.

Dr. Johnson does not understand the word, nor know what to substitute in its place. He says, there is no variation in the copies. Mr. Steevens suspects that <HI>you must not know when he sups,</HI> should be added to the speech of Pandarus; and that the following one of Paris should be given to Helen. He thinks that <HI>disposer</HI> should be changed into <HI>deposer;</HI> and supposes that she addresses herself to Pandarus, and, by <HI>de∣poser,</HI> means—she who thinks her beauty (or, whose beauty you suppose) to be superior to mine.</P>
<P>Mr. Steevenses conjecture is very ingenious and happy, but the propriety of his explanation is very doubtful. The dialogue should, perhaps, be regulated thus:</P>

<P>Dr. Johnson mistakes in asserting the uniformity of the the copies. The second folio reads the fifth speech thus:

<P>The hunts up, mr. Steevens says, was the name of the tune anciently played to wake the hunters, and collect them together.

<Q>I'll <HI>play</HI> the rakehells such a <HI>hunts up.</HI></Q></P>
<P>There was likewise a little rude song, which, it is sup∣posed was formerly in use on this occasion, as we learn
<PB N="183" REF="192"/>from Puttenham, <HI>Art of English Poesie,</HI> 1589. "One <HI>Gray,</HI>" says he, "what good estimation did he grow into with king Henry [the eighth], and afterward with the duke of Somerset protectour, for making certain merry ballades, whereof one chiefly was, <HI>The hunte is up, the hunte is up.</HI>" Whether the following be the identical <HI>merry ballade,</HI> doth not clearly appear; it is, however, very old:
<Q><L>The hunt is up, the hunt is up,</L>

<L>And he that's a bed with another mans wife,</L>
<L>It's time to get him away.</L></Q></P>

<P>The writer of these notes will here take occasion to ob∣serve, as one of the many great excellencies of this im∣mortal bard, that no author, ancient or modern, ever sa∣crificed less to the reigning superstition of the time than hisself. Whatever may be the temporary religion, Popish or Protestant, Paganism or Christianity, if its professors have the slightest regard for genius or virtue, Shakspeare, the poet of nature, addicted to no system of bigotry, will always be a favourite. There never was but one set of men who professed open enmity to his name and writings, and they were, at the same time, the declared and most virulent enemies of literature and morality, in every shape: It is scarcely necessary to add the mention of the barbarous en∣thusiasts of the last century; one, and perhaps the best founded of whose charges against that great and good mo∣narch whom they so savagely murdered was—his intimacy with the writings of WILLIAM SHAKSPEARE!!!—The circumstance would, at this time, at least, pass unnoticed in such a miscreant as <HI>Cocke,</HI> to whom a hatred of letters was as natural as it was to his more illustrious predecessor <HI>Jack Cade:</HI>—but when we see Milton—the sublime Milton—in∣sisting upon the enormity of this amiable trait in the cha∣racter of his murdered and libeled sovereign—our con∣tempt for and detestation of the act is equaled by our sur∣prize to find <HI>him</HI> the assassin!</P>

<P><HI>Lau.</HI> I will be brief, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>] Dr. Johnson thinks it "much to be lamented that the poet did not conclude the dialogue with the action, and avoid a narrative of events which the audience already knew." It was necessary, however, that the surviving characters should be made acquainted with the circumstances which produce the catastrophe, and we should have had more reason to condemn the poet for being <HI>brief</HI> than <HI>tedious.</HI> That our judicious author knew when to tell his story behind the curtain, and when upon the stage, is evident from the next play; and it was, perhaps, to avoid a sameness between the conclusion of that and present, that he has made the friar reveal the transaction to the audience; which naturally introduces the reconcili∣ation of the two families and the moral reflections at the end of the scene, which, whatever the critic may think, are too valuable to be sacrificed to his mere rule and com∣pass abridgement of it.</P>

Pos∣sibly Marcellus was an officer, whose duty it was to visit each watch, and perhaps continue with it some time. Ho∣ratio, as it appears, watches out of curiosity.

</SP>
<P><HI>Rots itself,</HI> is the reading of the two first folios; that of the <HI>quarto,</HI> mr. Steevens informs us (but as there are more quartos than one, we should have been more obliged to him if he had told us to <HI>which</HI> he alludes, and what the <HI>others</HI> read), is <HI>roots:</HI> and mr. Pope followed it: though mr. Steevens thinks the superiority of the present reading ap∣parent.
<PB N="195" REF="204"/>"To be in a quiescent state" he says, "<HI>(i. e.</HI> to <HI>root itself</HI>) affords an idea of activity." Very little activity, one would imagine, is necessary for the purpose of a weed <HI>rooting itsself;</HI> and that little is made almost none, when it <HI>roots itsself in ease.</HI> To <HI>rot,</HI> he thinks, better suits with the dullness and inaction to which the ghost refers." "And yet," adds he, "the accusative case <HI>itself</HI> may seem to demand the verb <HI>roots.</HI>" And with that reading the text would certainly be better. For, setting aside the impro∣priety of giving an <HI>octive</HI> signification to a <HI>neuter</HI> verb, it is far from being either necessary or even proper that the ghost should have any allusion to <HI>rottenness</HI> and <HI>decay:</HI> fat∣ness and stupidity being generally attended, at least in this world, with a tolerable share both of good health and of good fortune.</P>

<P>How far it detracts from the virtue of Hamlet to be represented as lying in wait for an opportunity to take an adequate and complete revenge upon the murderer of his father, is a question not, with submission to the great mo∣ralist, quite so easyly decided. The late king has reported hisself to have been destroyed in the most deliberate, horrid, and diabolical manner;

<L>O horrible! O horrible! most horrible!</L></Q> Under such aggravated circumstances, for Hamlet to be content with having what dr.

</SP>
<P>This wager dr. Johnson candidly professes hisself unable to understand. In a dozen passes, he says, one must exceed the other more or less than three hits: nor can be compre∣hend how, in a dozen, there can be twelve to nine. Mr. Malone, however, with the assistance of a "slight correc∣tion already made by sir T. Hanmer," thinks he has recon∣ciled all difficulties. By <HI>a dozen passes between yourself and him,</HI> he understands a dozen passes <HI>for each.</HI> The mean∣ing then, says he, is—"The king hath laid, that in a dozen passes a-piece between you and Laertes, he shall not have the advantage of you by three hits. <HI>He</HI> (viz. the king) <HI>hath laid on</HI> the terms of Laertes making twelve hits <HI>for nine</HI> which you shall make."—Or perhaps, he adds, the last <HI>he</HI> means Laertes, and then it will run—"<HI>He</HI> (viz. Laertes) hath laid on terms of making <HI>twelve hits</HI> for <HI>nine</HI> which you shall make." This, continues the ingenious critic, just exceeds Hamlets number by three. If therefor, says he, Laertes in his 12 passes should make 12 hits, and Hamlet in his 12 but 9, the king would lose.—If on the other hand, Laertes should make but 11 hits, and Hamlet 9, or Laertes 12 and Hamlet 10, his majesty would win.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="221"/>
Mr. Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one has evidently bestowed great pains in the above nice and accurate calculation. And great is his praise as an ingenious commentator, and a dexterous arithme∣tician. It must, therefor, be with no small diffidence after so laborious and mathematical a discussion of this intricate subject, which he has, doubtless, most satisfactoryly ex∣pounded, and, in the stile of his good old school-master, the venerable mr. Cocker, made plain to the meanest capacity, that any anonymous scribbler should venture to question the radix of his figurative system: and if that should unfor∣tunately cause a demolition of the whole fabric, alas the day!</P>
<P>That a <HI>dozen passes a-piece</HI> were NOT intended, does evi∣dentry appear from the ensuing scene, in which the king, previously to the encounter, declares, that,
<Q><L>If Hamlet give the <HI>first</HI> or <HI>second hit,</HI></L>
<L>Or quit in answer of the <HI>third exchange,</HI></L></Q> he will then drink his health. It is clear from this, that <HI>Laertes</HI> might get <HI>these three hits.</HI> But, in case either party (no matter which) were to be the sole assailant for the first twelve passes, and the other stand altogether on the defen∣sive, as the ingenious commentators own idea allows one to suppose, the kings proposal would be ridiculous and ab∣surd; for, if <HI>Hamlet</HI> played <HI>his</HI> bouts first, <HI>Laertes</HI> could not have a single <HI>chance</HI> out of 12 passes, or, at least, 9: and, on the contrary, if <HI>Laertes</HI> took the lead, there would be no possibility of <HI>Hamlets</HI> getting a <HI>single hit.</HI> The ingenious c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itic takes it for granted that passes might be made without a bit on either side; a conjecture for which there is not the slightest ground in the play: each pass (or number of passes) seems to have been made for the purpose of getting the <HI>hit,</HI> and did not end till the hit was given. But let us
<PB N="213" REF="222"/>see how the parties behave in the trial scene. "<HI>Here they play,</HI>" each endeavouring, we find, to hit the other. Hamlet gets the <HI>first</HI> and <HI>second hits,</HI> and calls on his antagonist for the <HI>third</HI> bout; praying him to <HI>pass with his best violence:</HI> they play again: La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtes wounds Hamlet: they become incensed, change rapiers, and Hamlet wounds Laertes. There does not seem the least foundation for the ingenious hypothesis and calculation in the note; the whole structure must, therefor, inevitably <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l to the ground. Had they played with coolness, and supposing their skill equal, the odds were (and so we are to understand Osrick) 12 to 9 in <HI>favour of Hamlet;</HI> for Laertes, to win, must have got 8 hits at the least; whereas Hamlet would have won if he had onely got 5; so that he had clearly the advantage of Laertes, in point of number, <HI>three</HI> whole passes or hits, and the odds were 8 to 5, which is in the same arithmetical proportion as 12 to 9, in Hamlets favour, before they begun to play. This is Shakspeares meaning, and renders the text clear and consistent throughout. And it onely remains to be consi∣dered whether dr. Johnson or mr. Malone has understood the passage best?</P>

</SP>
<P>Mr. Steevenses note on this passage is so interesting and extraordinary that it becomes necessary to insert it here at large, lest it might be thought to be partially or unfairly represented in the remarks which it has occasioned.</P>
<P>"Let us review for a moment the behaviour of Hamlet, on the strength of which Horatio founds this eulogy, and recommends him to the patronage of angels.</P>
<P>"Hamlet, at the command of his father's ghost, under∣takes with seeming alacrity to revenge the murder; and declares he will banish all other thoughts from his mind. He makes, however, but one effort to keep his word, and that is, when he mistakes Polonius for the king. On ano∣ther occasion, he defers his purpose till he can find an op∣portunity of taking his uncle when he is least prepared for death, that he may insure damnation to his soul. Though he assassinated Polonius by accident, yet he deliberately procures the execution of his school-fellows, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, who appear to have been unacquainted with the treacherous purposes of the mandate they were employed to carry. Their death (as he declares in a subse∣quent conversation with Horatio) gives him no concern, for they obtruded themselves into the service, and he thought he had a right to destroy them. He is not less ac∣countable for the distraction and death of Ophelia. He
<PB N="216" REF="225"/>comes to interrupt the funeral designed in honour of this lady, at which both the king and queen were present; and, by such an outrage to decency, renders it still more neces∣sary for the usurp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r to lay a second stratagem for his life, though the first had proved abortive. He comes to insult the brother of the dead, and to boast of an affection for his sister, which, before, he had denied to her face; and yet at this very time must be considered as desirous of sup∣porting the character of a madman, so that the openness of his confession is not to be imputed to him as a virtue. He apologizes to Horatio afterwards for the absurdity of this behaviour, to which, he says, he was provoked by that nobleness of fraternal grief, which, indeed, he ought rather to have applauded than condemned. Dr. Johnson has observed, that to bring about a reconciliation with Laertes, he has availed himself of a dishonest fallacy; and to conclude, it is obvious to the most careless spectator or reader, that he kills the king at last to revenge himself, and not his father.</P>
<P>"Hamlet cannot be said to have pursued his ends by very warrantable means; and if the poet, when he sacri∣ficed him at last, meant to have enforced such a moral, it is not the worst that can be deduced from the play; for as <HI>Maximus,</HI> in Beaumont and Fletchers <HI>Valentinian,</HI> says,
<Q><L>"Although his justice were as white as truth,</L>
<L>"His way was crooked to it; that condemns him."</L></Q></P>
<P>"The late dr. Akinside once observed to me, that the conduct of Hamlet was every way unnatural and indefen∣sible, unless he were to be regarded as a young man whose intellects were in some degree impaired by his own misfor∣tunes; by the death of his father, the loss of expected so∣vereignty, and a sense of shame resulting from the hasty and incestuons marriage of his mother.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="226"/>
"I have dwelt the longer on this subject, because Ham∣let seems to have been hitherto regared as a hero not un∣deserving the pity of the audience; and because no writer on Shakespeare has taken the pains to point out the immoral tendency of his character."</P>
<P>There are very few, it is believed, at all acquainted with this inimitable author, who would not be surprised, nay astonished, at such a severe and unexpected attack upon his principal and most favourite character: a character every one has been hitherto led to admire and esteem, not more by universal and long established opinion, than by the senti∣ments and feelings of his own mind. To find the amiable, the injured, the distracted, and unfortunate Hamlet repre∣sented as a worthless and immoral being, totally undeserv∣ing of the least pity from those almost numberless audiences whom the united force of Nature, Shakspeare, and Garrick has compelled to weep for his misfortunes; and whose compassion would not be less in the closet than in the theatre, seems the most extraordinary and irreconcilable proceeding in a writer of genius and learning that can be well imagined. However, as the heavy charges which are here brought against him will, upon the slightest examination, appear to be groundless, unwarrantable, and unjust, there is little reason to fear that the confidence and ingenuity with which they are advanced and supported will answer the purpose of the learned objector.</P>
<P>Hamlet, the onely child of the late king, upon whose death he became lawfully intitled to the crown, had, it seems, ever since that event, been in a state of melancholy, owing to ex∣cessive grief for the suddenness with which it had taken place, and an indignant horror at his mothers speedy and incestu∣ous marriage. The spirit of the king his father appears, and makes him acquainted with the circumstances of his un∣timely
<PB N="218" REF="227"/>fate, which he excites him to <HI>revenge:</HI> this Ham∣let engages to do: an engagement it does not appear he ever forgot. It behoved him, however, to conduct hisself with the greatest prudence. The usurper was powerful, and had Hamlet carryed his design into immediate execu∣tion, it could not but have been attended with the worst consequences to his own life and fame. No one knew what the ghost had imparted to him; till he afterwards made Horatio acquainted with it: and though his interview with the spirit gave him certain proof and sa∣tisfactory reason to know and detest the usurper, it would scarcely, in the eye of the people, have justifyed his killing their king. To conceal, and, at a convenient time, to ef∣fect, his purpose, he counterfeits madness, and, for his greater assurance, puts the spirits evidence and the usurpers guilt to the test of a play, by which the truth of each is manifested. He soon after espies the usurper at prayers, but resolves, and with great justice resolves, not to kill him in the very moment when he might be making his peace with heaven: inasmuch as a death so timed would have been rather a happyness than a punishment, and, by no means, a proper revenge for his fathers murder. We next find him in the queens apartment, endeavouring to make her sensible of the state of vice and horror into which her unnatural connection with the usurper had plunged her. At the beginning of this conference he mistakes Polonius, who was <HI>behind the arras,</HI> and about to alarm the household, for the usurper, and, under that apprehension, stabs him. The spirit appears (not very necessaryly, perhaps) "to whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his almost blunted purpose." He is, immediately, sent off to England: and, in his passage, discovers the treacherous and fatal purpose of the commission with which his compa∣nion and pretended friends were charged. These men, he
<PB N="219" REF="228"/>knew, had eagerly solicited and even thrust theirselves upon this employment; and he had, of course, sufficient reason to conclude that they were well acquainted with the nature and purport of their fatal packet. That Shakspeare meant to charge them with this knowlege, and to represent them as <HI>participes criminis,</HI> is evident from the old black letter <HI>Hystorie</HI> which furnished him with the subject, where they are not only made privy to, but actually <HI>devise</HI> the scheme to take Hamlets life. His own safety depended on their removal; and, at such a time, and under such circum∣stances, he would have been fully justifyed in using any means to procure it.</P>
<P>That he is "accountable for the distraction and death of Ophelia" is a most strange charge indeed. He had, to be sure, accidentally killed her father, whom he <HI>took for his betters.</HI> This causes her distraction; and her distraction causes her death. A most lamentable train of circumstances! and with which the moral character of Hamlet is as little concerned at that of the ingenious, though uncandid, com∣mentator.</P>
<P>That "he comes to interrupt the funeral designed in ho∣nour of this lady," is an assertion which has nothing but the credit of the asserter to support it. Walking with his friend Horatio through a churchyard, he enters into con∣versation with a grave-digger; but, presently, observing the approach of a funeral procession, he says to Horatio, to whom he was then speaking:
<Q><L>Soft, soft, aside. Here comes the king,</L>
<L>The queen, the courtiers: <HI>Who is this they follow?</HI></L>
<L><HI>And with such maimed rites?</HI> This doth betoken</L>
<L>The corse they follow, did with desperate hand</L>
<L><PB N="220" REF="229"/>Fordo its own life. 'Twas of some estate,</L>
<L>Couch we a while, and mark.</L></Q> Does it appear from hence that he knew, or had the least reason to suspect this to be the funeral of Ophelia; or even that he was apprised of her distraction or unfortu∣nate death? The contrary is most certain. He left the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ingdom before her insanity broke out, and does not re∣turn till after she is dead: he has seen no one, except Ho∣ratio, who was certainly unacquainted with the latter cir∣cumstance, so that it is next to an impossibility that he could have known what had happened to her. But to pro∣ceed: Laertes asking <HI>what ceremony else?</HI> Hamlet observes to Horatio, <HI>That is Laertes; a very noble youth.</HI> Laertes concluding his expostulation about the further honours with the following beautyful lines:
<Q><L>— lay her i'the earth;</L>
<L>And from her fair and unpolluted flesh</L>
<L>May violets spring!—I tell thee, churlish priest,</L>
<L>A ministring angel shall <HI>my sister</HI> be,</L>
<L>When thou liest howling;</L></Q> Hamlet exclaims: <HI>What! the fair Ophelia?</HI> His surprise and astonishment on hearing Laertes name his sister are manifestly apparent, and may serve to convince the learned critic, and every one who has been misled by his ill-founded accusations, that Hamlet does NOT come to interrupt the funeral, and is guilty of NO outrage what∣ever. He as little "comes to insult the brother of the dead," or "to boast of an affection for his sister, which before he had [in a wild and careless manner when he was under the necessity of <HI>counterfeiting madness</HI>] denied to her face." Laertes bids

<L>Depriv'd thee of;</L></Q> an execration Hamlet cannot but perceive to be pointed at hisself. Having uttered this curse, Laertes, hastyly, and in direct violation of all decorum, jumps into the grave, where he "rants and mouths it" like a player. This out∣rageous proceeding seems to infect Hamlet; who, forgetting hisself, as he afterward, with sorrow, owns to Horatio, and, by the "bravery" of the others grief being worked up "into a towering passion," leaps in after him: and he who thinks Hamlets madness or sincerity counterfeit here does not appear to know so much of Shakspeare or of human nature as every one who reads this play ought to do.</P>
<P>The affection Hamlet now boasts for Ophelia was ge∣nuine and violent; we find him with the very same senti∣ments in the beginning of the play, and he has never once disowned it, except on a single occasion, when the sacrifice was required by his assumed character; a circumstance which cannot, at least ought not to, be imputed to him as a crime.</P>
<P>The behaviour and language of Laertes is more ranting and unnatural, than noble and pathetic, and, with his ex∣ecration upon Hamlet previously to his leaping into the grave, and the violent shock which Hamlet might feel on learning the corse to be Ophelias, might easyly work up to, and apologise for, a higher pitch of extravagance, a stronger and more composed mind than that of which Hamlet appears to have been then master.</P>
<P>Hamlets conversation with Laertes, immediately before the fencing scene, was at the queens earnest intreaty, and though dr. Johnson be pleased to give it the harsh name of "a dishonest fallacy," there are better, because more na∣tural, judges who consider it as a most gentle and pathetic
<PB N="222" REF="231"/>address; and cannot perceive it to be either dishonest or fallacious: for, certainly, Hamlet did not intend the death of <HI>Polonius;</HI> of consequence, unwittingly, and by mere ac∣cident, injured Laertes, who, after declaring that he was "satisfyed in nature," and that he onely delayed his per∣fect reconcilement till his honour were satisfyed by elder masters, whom, at the same time, (for he has the instru∣ment of death in his hand) he never meant to consult, says,
<Q><L>— Till that time,</L>
<L>I do receive your offer'd LOVE LIKE LOVE,</L>
<L>And WILL NOT WRONG IT.</L></Q></P>
<P>On which the truely virtuous, innocent, and unsuspecting Hamlet replies,
<Q><L>— I embrace it freely</L>
<L>And will this BROTHERS wager frankly play.</L></Q></P>
<P>Let the conduct and sentiments of Laertes, in this inter∣view, and in his conversation with the usurper, together with his villainous design against the life of Hamlet, be examined and tryed by any rules of gentility, honour, or humanity, natural or artificial, he must be considered as a treacherous, cowardly, diabolical wretch. Is such a cha∣racter to rise on the fall of the generous Hamlet?</P>
<P>Things are sometimes obvious to very careless specta∣tors or readers, which are not discerned by those who play closer attention to the scene. Hamlet, in a trial of skill with Laertes, receives an unexpected, a treacherous, and mortal wound. Immediately before the company enter, he appears to be much troubled in mind; his spirits fore∣boding what was to happen: "If it be now," says he, "'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come; the readyness is all."
<PB N="223" REF="232"/>He does not appear to have suspected Laertes of any unfair practice (he did not know so much of him as we do), but he had every reason to expect treachery and murder from the usurper; he might too have heared something of his secret juggling with Laertes; and, doubtless, intended to revenge the death of his father. Being thus wounded, and on the threshold of futurity, if he had not killed the usurper im∣mediately, the villain would have escaped unpunished. But he does not stab him for his treachery toward hisself,—he upbraids him with his crimes of INCEST and MURDER,— and consigns him to the infernal regions,
<Q>With all his 'rank offences' thick upon him.</Q></P>
<P>So that he sufficiently revenges his father, his mother (who, by the way, dyes, if not deservedly, at least unpityed), and hisself. As to his own fall, every reader or spectator must sympathise with Horatio, for the untimely loss of a youth∣ful prince possessed of such great and amiable qualities, rendered miserable by such unparalleled misfortunes;
<Q><L>—For he was likely, had he been put on,</L>
<L>To have prov'd most royally;</L></Q> and who falls a sacrifice to the most base and infernal ma∣chinations. His death, however, is not to be looked upon as a punishment; the most innocent, as Shakspeare well knew, are frequently confounded with the most guilty; and the virtues of Hamlet were to be rewarded among those angels which his friend Horatio invokes to escort him to everlasting rest.</P>
<P>Dr. Akenside was a very ingenious, sensible, and worthy man: but enough has been said to satisfy those who doubt, that the conduct of Hamlet is neither unnatural nor inde∣fensible. That his intellects were really impaired by the circumstances enumerated by the above learned physician,
<PB N="224" REF="233"/>is very probable; and, indeed, Hamlet hisself, more than once, plainly insinuates it. See, in particular, the latter part of his soliloquy at the end of the second act.</P>
<P>The opposing and refuting of general charges by proof and circumstance commonly requires much more time and space than the making of them. The writer is sensible that the arguments here adduced are neither arranged so judiciously, nor expressed so well, as the objections of the learned com∣mentator; but from what has been said, and as it is said, it will appear, that it has not been without strong and suf∣ficient reasons that Hamlet has "been hitherto regarded as a hero not undeserving the pity of the audience;" and the ingenious critic will not, perhaps, have much cause to con∣gratulate hisself, on being the onely person who has taken pains to point out the <HI>immoral tendency</HI> of as noble, as virtuous, and as interesting a character,
<Q>As e'er 'imagination' cop'd withall.</Q></P>

<P>This passage is too stubborn for any but a master critic to attack; and those who have hitherto attempted it have little reason to boast of their success. Sir Thomas Hanmer reads <HI>fair phyz;</HI> which dr. Warburton calls a "White∣friers phrase," and thinks Iago is repeating Othellos own words, alluding to him. Mr. Steevens seems gently to in∣cline to Theobalds notion, that the fair wife was Iagos. Dr. Johnson, according to his usual custom when there is real difficulty in a passage, has nothing to propose. Mr. Tollet thinks one might read <HI>salse wife.</HI> Mr. Tyrwhitt be∣lieves the true reading is <HI>fair life.</HI> Mr. Steevens, in a subse∣quent note, observes, that <HI>almost damn'd in a wife</HI> can onely be said of a man who is near being marryed; thinking, it seems, that a man actually marryed is not <HI>almost,</HI> but <HI>alto∣gether damn'd.</HI> It is, however, settled that Cassio is the Flo∣rentine, and evident that <HI>wise</HI> can never be the true word; since he neither is marryed, nor, till some time after, has any connection with a woman, at least to our knowlege.
<PB N="226" REF="235"/>Mr. Tyrwhitt seems to have come the nearest to what we may conceive to be Iagos meaning; and as his emendation does so little violence to the text, the editors would cer∣tainly have been justifiable in adopting it.</P>

<L>Of arts inhibited and out of warrant."</L></Q></P>
<P>But there is no doubt that Shakspeare had the substance of Brabantios speech from Cinthios novel, however he might come by it, and Cinthio, it may be supposed, knew something of the Veneti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n statute. As to the <HI>edict</HI> against these practices by James I. it may be fairly presumed, that his sapiency had just about as much concern in its fabri∣cation as (if wisdom and learning be as criminal as it is rare in a great king) a somewhat less sapient successor of his had in its repeal.</P>

<P>From this quibble mr. Malone conjectures that the word <HI>one</HI> was anciently pronounced as if it were written <HI>on.</HI> That this was the ancient and original pronunciation is very probable, as appears from the word <HI>only</HI> (onely), and the vulgar usage in many counties at this day. But that it was not the general practice in our authors time is evident from the following passages:</P>
<P><HI>Much ado about 'lothing,</HI> act V. scene i.
<Q><L>Nor let no comforter delight mine ear,</L>
<L>But such A ONE whose wrongs do suit with mine.</L></Q> <HI>Macbeth,</HI> act IV. scene iv.
<Q><PB N="238" REF="245"/>
<L>There's not A ONE of them, but in his house</L>
<L>I keep a servant see'd.</L></Q> A love letter of Henry the eighth to Anna Bullen, printed by Hearne at the end of Robert de Avesbury, will clearly shew the pronunciation of that period.</P>
<P>"As touching a lodging for you, we have gotten WON by my lord Cardinals means, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>"
<NOTE N="20" PLACE="foot">(20) Mr. Malone, on another occasion (v. 72.), observed to mr. Steevens, "that <HI>ere</HI> and o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are perpetually confounded in the old copies of our author." The learned gentleman, probably, made this observation before he had ever looked into an old copy: or he has discovered a <HI>perpetual confusion</HI> of which it would be difficult for any other person to find a single instance.</NOTE></P>

<P>— <HI>that young Hamlet was born.</HI>] By this scene, judge Blackstone observes, it appears that Hamlet was then thirty years old. And yet, says he, in the beginning of the play he is spoken of as a <HI>very young</HI> man, one that de∣signed to go back to school, <HI>i. e.</HI> to the university of Wit∣tenberg. The poet in the fifth act, he thinks, had forgot what he wrote in the first.</P>
<P>In fact, however, the poet has forgot nothing; neither is there any reason to suppose the least inconsistency in the matter: men may study, or reside at the university to <HI>any age.</HI></P>

<P>It is very true; but the learned commentator should have added, that he had been deprived of the title, and <HI>be∣headed</HI> by Henry IV. The nobleman to whom the king now addresses hisself is Thomas Beaufort, earl of Dorset, who was, indeed, created duke of Exeter, but not till some years after the time of this conference.</P>

<STAGE>Putting a paper crown on his head.</STAGE>
<P>Shakspeare, mr. Steevens observes, has on this occasion deviated from history. The paper crown, he says, was not placed on the duke of Yorks head till after it had been cut off.</P>
<P>The ingenious commentator is most certainly mistaken. Shakspeare, so far from having deviated from history, has
<PB N="240" REF="247"/>followed it with the utmost precision. Whethamstede ex∣pressly tells us that the Lancastrians, in direct breach of a mutual agreement, and before the day appointed for the battle, fell suddenly upon the dukes army, and took him and the earl of Salisbury prisoners; treating both, but especially the duke, in the most shameful manner. <HI>Nam,</HI> says he, <HI>statuentes eum super unum parvum formicarium colli∣culum, &amp; quoddam sertum vile, ex palustri gramine confectum, imponentes, per modum coronae, super capud suum, non aliter quam Ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aei coram Domino incurvaverunt genua sua coram ipso, dicentes illuserie:</HI> Ave rex sine regimine; Ave rex absque hereditate; Ave dux &amp; p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inceps absque omni populo penitus &amp; possessione. <HI>Et hiis una cum aliis variis, in eum probrose opprobri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>seque dictis, coegerunt ipsum demum per capitis absci∣sionem clameum relinquere suae justiciae vendicacionis.</HI> (p. 489.) Not a single circumstance is omitted or varyed in the scene. It is not, however, imagined that Shakspeare had ever con∣sulted Whethamstede: he found the same story, no doubt, in some old black letter chronicle, which it has not been the writers fortune to meet with, or he might possibly have it from popular tradition.</P>

<HEAD>THE GENUINE TEXT OF SHAKSPEARE.</HEAD>
<HEAD><HI>Preparing for the Press,</HI> AN EDITION OF THE PLAYS OF WILLIAM SHAKSPEARE, WITH NOTES.</HEAD>
<P>THIS edition will be comprised in eight duodecimo volumes; and will be carefully and accurately printed from the onely copies of real authority, the two first folios. But although these editions will be the standard of the intended work, such passages in the old quartos as may appear to have been omitted by accident, or with a view to shorten the representation, and every various reading, will be maturely considered, and, if wor∣thy of insertion, be adopted, either in the text or margin, as their importance or merit may seem to require. No variation, however, will be made from the standard edi∣tions
<PB REF="249"/>without apprising the reader of it, unless the diffe∣rence should consist merely in a slight typographical error. Nor is any difference between the various editions in other respects intended to be otherwise than occasionally re∣garded. The orthography will be reduced with the utmost care to a modern and uniform system, except where a change would be injurious to the authors sense and meaning. Various or doubtful readings will be settled from an attentive examination of the sentiments of every commentator. The notes, which will be very sparingly introduced, and never but where they seem absolutely ne∣cessary, or peculiarly proper, will be chiefly extracted, under the names of their respective authors, from the edi∣tions of Theobald, Warburton, Johnson, and Steevens; but not to the exclusion of better, though, perhaps, ano∣nymous, intelligence, if it can be given. It is, however, no part of the editors design to fill his margin with a view of the corruptions, or a refutation of the errors of preced∣ing commentators.</P>
<P>The authors life, with the usual documents (particularly a more exact copy of his will than has been yet published), and the prefaces of his various editors will be prefixed to to the work: which will, likewise, be attended with a new, copious, and accurate glossary. And, in an additional vo∣lume, it is proposed to give a complete verbal index, adapted to the intended edition.</P>
<P>This edition will, with regard to the correctness of the text, be infinitely superior to any that has yet appeared. It will possess all the advantages of every former edition, and be as little liable, it is hoped, as possible to the defects of any.</P>
