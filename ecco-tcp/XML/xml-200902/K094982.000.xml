<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spad.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, Sir, after robbing me of 500 ducatoons, and blinding my eyes, they throw'd me over a mule's back, and carried me to their dunge∣on
<PB N="26" REF="26"/>on, where they live in all manner of debaucheries, from whence they rush out upon passengers; but I slipt the bandage from my eyes as I went along, and mark'd the path they took.</P>

<P>How came my father to think of an al∣liance in this mad family; Don Scipio's brain is certainly turn'd; my father's ideas don't suit mine.

<P>I wonder how my work goes on. <STAGE>(To Don Juan.)</STAGE> I give you joy, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and I'll give you sorrow, you damn'd rascal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I'll have you hang'd, you dog you.</P>

<P>Come along, my cara sposa. <STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE> Aye, my old master! I must brazen it out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juan.</SPEAKER>
<P>You rascal you, a pistol for you! I'll thrash you.</P>

<P>I'm going to be married to an heiress; so I must not be beat to a mummy.</P>

<SPEAKER>Ferd. </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(To Lorenza.)</STAGE>
<P>I understand, Don Alphonzo has been honoured with your partiality: I suppose you will have no objection to give him your hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>I blush to see him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alph.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dearest Lorenza!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>Egad, my business goes on prettily be∣tween you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scip.</SPEAKER>
<P>You see, Don Juan, how this business is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, and very shameful it is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scip.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I give my blessing to them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ferd.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what will make amends for your in∣nded breach of contract with me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scip.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did not I tell you I was in love?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing can atone for your intention to introduce your Italian frippery into my family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scip.</SPEAKER>
<P>How shall I get out of this? I will revenge all upon this rascal, Spado. Here, a brace of al∣guazils and handcuffs for him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spa.</SPEAKER>
<P>For me! I'm the best friend you ever had in the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scip.</SPEAKER>
<P>How? prove it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Was not you going to marry that lady?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scip.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spa.</SPEAKER>
<P>You had better not. She and I happen to be old acquaintance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Isab.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, more lies! and do you believe him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't you know I liv'd with a certain captain that stole off with the lady to Italy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Isab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh Don Scipio, I will find the means to silence that wretch, and you will feel the effects of it.</P>
</SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spad.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think Sir, I've prov'd a friend to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scip.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, but that shan't save your neck.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="60" REF="60"/>
<SPEAKER>Spa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think I have saved your honour and your throat too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scip.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, how did you do that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spad.</SPEAKER>
<P>There were two of the banditti in the castle this morning, and I got them out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scip.</SPEAKER>
<P>How?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spad.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I told them they might come and cut your throat to-morrow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scip.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was very kind of you. I am very much obliged to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you have time to get a guard ready, and give them a warm reception.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ferd.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, my little busy friend, what induced you to all this roguery on my account?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, I would have prevented your mar∣riage with Donna Victoria, in hopes of obtaining a reward from Don Alphonzo.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scip.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have done no great mischief, after all your artifices; though I believe you are a sad dog: but, as you have been the means of bringing things a∣bout in the present agreeable manner, I forgive you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juan.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, let me tell you, Sir, I will have—</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Half draws.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scip.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you shall have—a bottle of the best wine in all Andalusia. Here we will have flutes, and hautboys, and every thing else to make us hap∣py, and our friends welcome: and we hope our good-natured friends will forget and forgive our defects.</P>
