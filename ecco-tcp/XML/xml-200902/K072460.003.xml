<HEAD>THE CHILDREN'S FRIEND.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>ROBIN.</HEAD>
<P>ROBIN was about six years of age. He was not wicked, but his mother let him always have his way; and then his father was afraid that the poor child might cry his eyes out, if he wanted any thing, and should not get it. Being thus indulged, his whims grew every day more frequent, and they could not always be gratified; for his parents were extremely poor, and li∣ved, as the expression is, from hand to mouth. He grew at last quite obstinate and quarrelsome, insisted upon hav∣ing every thing that he saw, and when he could not get it, would grow sulky, tear his cloaths to show his spite, do nothing that he was bid to do, and often quite the contrary.</P>
<P>His parents were much grieved to see this behaviour in him, and judged it to proceed from a heart naturally perverse. Alas! cried his mother, I once hoped that our little Robin would in time console us under all our griefs, be the joy of our old age, and work for our sup∣port, when we were past our strength, reflecting that we had done so much to feed and bring him up: but, on the contrary, he is our greatest unhappiness. His prin∣ciples are quite corrupt, said the father; every one will hate him utterly, and not a soul assist him in his need. He will commit some wicked action, and be punished for it by his country. He will live in shame and misery. God grant I may be dead before this comes to pass.</P>
<P>These mortifying thoughts would constantly be upper∣most within them. They were now no longer cheerful at their daily toil, and had no appetite for their meals. Their sorrow had a visible effect upon their health; their strength soon failed them; and one morning, being more
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>depressed than usual, they had not sufficient spirits to get up. Not so the little Robin: he was up as usual, and called for his breakfast. Robin, said his mother, I am very ill, and cannot rise to get it for you. On which he sulked, she wept, and Hutchinson his father sighed. The little urchin waited yet some time; but seeing neither of them stir, resolved instantly what to do. He went to a neighbour's house for a light, as he designed to make a fire. A little girl came down to let him in; and seeing Robin, asked him what he wanted, with a tone of voice that seemed to say he was not welcome; for she did not like him in the least. I want to light my candle, answer∣ed Robin, Well, do so, returned the little girl, as I have let you in: but do not come here again. This way of talking Robin did not much like. He was very easily offended; so he went away and did not even light his candle.</P>
<P>After this he visited another neighbour, who came down; but seeing Robin through the casement, he would not so much as ask him what he wanted, but went up again. Refused admittance every where, he came home, put down the candle, and bethought himself of going to a good old woman's, who formerly used to treat him with sweet things. He went and asked her for some break∣fast. Breakfast! answered Frances: why has not your mother let you have some? She is a-bed, said Robin. Well, your father then? He likewise is a-bed. They say, they are ill. And would you leave them then, and come to me for victuals? Get you gone! I have nothing for you. Had I more than what I want myself, I would give it to poor children who are fonder of their parents than you are, and make them happy, whereas you every day torment yours.</P>
<P>Robin came away in tears, and walked home very slowly. In the way, he recollected that he himself had frequently shammed illness; and supposed it not im∣possible that his parents might now be doing the same. For certainty, he got upon a little chair, held back the curtain, and beheld how pale they were. He saw that they had been crying too. This sight affected him. He put the curtains to again, sat down beside the bed, and held his hands up to his face. Unhappy that I am!
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>said he, suppose my parents were to die, what would become of me? I am refused admittance every where, and cannot obtain a bit of bread. I must then have been very wicked! my poor mother! how you have at all times loved me! and how have I grieved you! And my father, my dear father—Who can tell, alas! but they will die?</P>
<P>He sat a little longer thinking; and returning after∣wards to the house where he had been refused entrance at first, begged for heaven's sake that they would let him have a little bread and milk, to make a breakfast for his parents. His affliction and the humble tone of voice with which he now addressed them, easily gained him a hearing. Look ye, said the good man of the cottage, since you ask me thus, I will not refuse you. Take the half of this brown loaf, with some of this milk, and warm it for your parents. It is but just that you should prepare their breakfast, while they are both work∣ing so hard for you. He durst not mention that they were ill, because he feared the same reproaches which Frances had bestowed upon him, though he merited them now much less: on which account his charitable bene∣factor did not go himself to see them; as he would have done, had he but known their situation, for he esteemed them greatly.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Robin brought away the bread and milk, came home, made up a fire, and putting on a pipkin, boiled the milk. It was no sooner ready, than he drew a little table towards the bed. His mother heard him move about the chamber. What can Robin be doing? said his mother. Nothing good, I fear, answer∣ed Hutchinson. She wished to know, endeavoured to sit up in bed; and looking through the curtains, which were very flimsy, saw the little table with two porringers, and Robin, who was cutting bread into them. Upon this, she jogged her husband. See, said she, I verily be∣lieve he is doing this for us; else, why two porringers up∣on the table? Would to God, said Hutchinson, he were! I am not hungry, but should like to be convinced that he is better than we have thought him.</P>
<P>Robin, with his pipkin came at last; and filling both the porringers approached his parents. Hold, said he,
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>dear father; hold dear mother.—Here's some breakfast for you both.—And is it you that prepared it? said the father. Who could give you all this bread and milk? It was neighbour such-a-one, answered he. The father and the mother bade him put down both the porringers again. Their eyes grew bright with joy. Dear child! come hither, cried they. You are not what we thought you to be; you bring both of us to life again. So saying, they held out their arms: he bent to their em∣brace; he wept, as they did likewise; he desired for∣giveness for the grief which he had occasioned them; and promised that they should henceforth be rejoiced by his behaviour.</P>
<P>He was still in their arms, when Frances entered with her breakfast in her hand; which she brought, in order to share it with her indisposed good neigh∣bours. She was moved at such a piteous sight, shed tears of joy, and blessed the little Robin, who, on-his side, tenderly embraced her also. They all breakfasted together, and had never in their lives before enjoyed so sweet a meal.</P>
<P>The happiness of such a day soon re-established this good father, and this loving mother, in their former state of health. The little boy also became very happy. He acquired the love of every one that knew him, was caressed with justice by his parents and the charita∣ble Frances, who rejoiced to do them all the good in her power.</P>

<HEAD>AMELIA.</HEAD>
<P>AMELIA when scarcely six years old, was very fond of her mamma, and wished continually to be with her. On a certain day, Amelia's mother wished to go to market, and the little girl entreated to accom∣pany her thither. You will only be troublesome to me, child, said she. No, no; I hope, I shall not be troublesome to you, said Amelia; and pressed so much that her mama at last consented to give her leave.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="11"/>They set out, therefore, both together. As it chanced, their house was in the country, and the paths proved very bad. Amelia frequently was forced to walk behind her mother, when the ruts would not permit them to have hold of one another. They were now come very near the town; and as it chanced, the road was crouded with a multitude of people passing every way. The little girl was often separated from her mother; but this gave her no un∣easiness, as after two or three such accidents, she had rejoined her with ease, but the nearer they approached the market, the more she perceived the crowd to augment. This should necessarily have made her watchful of the way that her mother went; and yet, a sort of puppet-show which was exhibiting, had charms sufficient to detain her. She stopped short to gaze at Punchinello. In the midst, how∣ever, of her entertainment, she turned round, but could not see her mother; she ran on, called out, and scrambling up a bank, at once looked over all the people's heads: but it was in vain. She could not see her, could not hear her voice; and now the little maiden, being frightened, durst not mix among so great a crowd, that jostled one another. So she got into a corner, called out mammy! mammy! and burst into a flood of tears.</P>
<P>The people that went by, looked at her. <HI>There is a little girl,</HI> said one among them, <HI>in a piteous taking! What is the matter with you?</HI> asked another. <HI>I have lost my mammy! Oh, never mind it;</HI> answered he. <HI>You will find her cut again, I warrant you.</HI> A third said, <HI>Do not cry, my little girl. She will not come to you the sooner for that.</HI> Thus said many, and they all went on about their business.</P>
<P>By good luck, at last, however, an old woman who sold eggs and butter, and was lame and therefore could not walk without a crutch, was going by, but seeing her in such distress, stopped short and pitied her. <HI>And which way was your mother going, little dear,</HI> said the woman, <HI>when you lost her? She was going to the market,</HI> said Amelia. <HI>Well, be comforted,</HI> replied the first; <HI>and come along with me. I will take you to the market. You will find her there, no doubt.</HI> Amelia gave her hand, that moment, to the good old woman, and soon reached the market. As they en∣tered, she perceived her mother, gave a cry of joy, and up her mother came immediately. She took the little girl into her arms, and said, You frightened me exceedingly,
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>my dear, by wandering from me: and the child, that mo∣ment, fell a hugging her, and cried.</P>
<P>She told her of the puppet-show, and that she had stopped to look at it; how she called out after her, and how the good old market-woman, and she only, had taken pity of her and brought her through the crowd. Amelia's mother thanked her, bought what eggs and butter she had left, and gave her more than she asked. Amelia kissed her ten times over; and while going home, would talk of nothing but the good old market-woman.</P>
<P>When the first fine weather came, Amelia begged her mother to go see Dame Dunch, which was the market-woman's name: and she consented, took a loaf of bread, and half a pound of tea, with sugar in proportion. Dame Dunch's dwelling was a wooden one: it was not large, but very clean and comfortable. In the front, there was a little grass-plat, shaded on every side by fruit trees; upon which, Amelia danced till evening with a niece of the Dame's who was as kind and good natured as her aunt.</P>
<P>Amelia's mother always bought Dame Dunch's eggs and butter, but complained that she rated them at too low a price; while Dame Dunch would have it that she was paid too much. Amelia and her mother gave the good old woman all the assistance in their power; and when in <HI>her</HI> turn the old woman could be serviceable to Amelia or her mother, she would put on her cloth apron, take her crutch, and come quite out of breath, but very joyous.</P>
<P>Thus they did each other mutual service: but the good old woman had the greatest reason to rejoice, that she had taken pity on a little girl in trouble. In the act of helping her, she did not think that her good heart would gain her such a world of happy hours.</P>

<SPEAKER>Letitia.</SPEAKER>
<P>WHAT a charming day is Christmas Mon∣day, when one has such handsome pre∣sents! How I long to see it!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serina.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! do not speak about it, sister. The first five and twenty days of this dull gloomy month, appear much longer than the rest all put together. What fine things we are to have! I dream about them every night, and wake a dozen times, when Christmas Monday is the first thing that takes up my thoughts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letitia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you recollect, last year, how all mama's acquaintance brought us play-things and sweet-meats. We had really so much, we knew not where to put them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serina.</SPEAKER>
<P>They were spread upon a large square table, and mama came out to call us with her charming voice. Come, come, said she, and take these presents. She em∣braced us, and shed tears. I never saw her half so happy as that day, when she beheld us jump about the room for joy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letitia.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think, indeed, she seemed much happier than ourselves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serina.</SPEAKER>
<P>One would have thought that she had received the Christmas-boxes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letitia.</SPEAKER>
<P>There must consequently be a pleasure, I sup∣pose, in giving: so I will tell you what we ought to do, Letitia. We are very little, and of course have little that we can give. But still we have it in our power to get this pleasure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serina.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, pray, Letitia?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letitia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, it wants a fortnight now, you know, of Christmas Monday: and we both have money in our pockets.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; I have upwards of a crown. What shall we do then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letitia.</SPEAKER>
<P>You recollect, our fair comes on to-morrow. Well then, we must get up early, and work hard, and study diligently, and do every part of our business well, that in the afternoon we may have leave to go and see the
<PB N="8" REF="14"/>fair. Now I have more a good deal than nine shillings. We will each take half our money, and go buy the pret∣tiest things that we can see. We will bring them home all cleverly wrapped up, and early upon Christmas Mon∣day, give them to our gardener's children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; but then, Letitia, the poor woman's children, who comes here to work occasionally, must have something likewise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letitia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right; I did not think of them. O, how de∣lighted they will be! I fancy the poor little children, in their joy, will say that they never had a Christmas-box before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serina.</SPEAKER>
<P>In that case, we shall be the first to cause them such a deal of pleasure.—O, my dear, dear sister! I must hug you for that thought!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letitia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but stay a little. I have another in my head. This money which we design to spend—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is ours; and we may lay it out as we think proper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letitia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, that is true. But—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but what?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letitia.</SPEAKER>
<P>We had it from mama, you know; it was her present to us, as in general all our money is. Now sister, if we lay this money out in presents for the chil∣dren, it will then be mama that has made these presents, and not we.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serina.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is true indeed; and yet we have no other money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letitia.</SPEAKER>
<P>We can, notwithstanding, hit on some expe∣dient for the purpose, I dare say. For in the first place, I can work indifferently at my needle, and you knit with tolerable ease.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of what use will this be?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letitia.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will not be long before you have knit a pair of garters for papa; and I have been this fortnight at a pair of ruffles, which he does not know. What then hinders, pray, but we may finish these two articles a day or two on this side Christmas Monday?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and if we do, what then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letitia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then we can present the garters and the rurfles to papa, who will be glad to buy them of us, and pay thrice as much as they are worth.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="15"/>
<SPEAKER>Serina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; I am sure of that. But still the fair will be to-morrow; and we cannot before then finish what you know is to procure the money that we would lay out at the fair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letitia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor is it necessary; for the money that we shall want, to make our purchase at the fair, we may borrow of ourselves; and afterwards repay it upwards of two days before we make our presents. Thus then we shall really have it in our power to say, that we alone gave Christmas-boxes to the poor children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serina.</SPEAKER>
<P>A good scheme indeed! Well, you are always the readiest at these matters, I confess; but then that is because you are the eldest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letitia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bless me! How we shall both rejoice, in being able to afford them so much pleasure!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serina.</SPEAKER>
<P>I could wish that to-morrow were the day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letitia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never fear, it will soon come now; and we shall be happy even in the expectation of its coming.</P>

<HEAD>ABEL.</HEAD>
<P>LITTLE Abel was scarce turned of eight years old, when he had the misfortune to lose his mother. It afflicted him so much, that nothing could restore him to the gaiety so natural to young children. Mrs. Donaldson, his aunt, was forced to take him to her house, for fear his sadness should still aggravate her brother's inconsolable distress.</P>
<P>They went, however, frequently to see him; and at last, the time was come for going out of mourning. Abel therefore quitted his; and, though his heart was full of sorrow, he endeavoured to assume a lively counte∣nance. His father was affected at this sensibility: but alas! it only occasioned him more sorrow, by causing him to reflect that he had for ever lost the mother of this amiable child; and this reflexion, every one remarked, was bringing him with sorrow to the grave.</P>
<P>It was a fortnight now, since Abel had been to see him as usual. His aunt always urged some pretext or other during that time, as often as he wished to go. The truth
<PB N="10" REF="16"/>is, Mr. Donaldson was dangerously ill. He durst not ask to see his child, from apprehension that the sight of his condition might too much affect him. These paternal struggles, joined with the former depression of his spirits, so exhausted him, that very soon there was no hope re∣maining of his cure. He died, in fact, upon the day before his birth-day.</P>
<P>On the morrow, Abel, having waked betimes, tor∣mented Mrs. Donaldson so much for leave to go and wish his father joy, that she at last consented; but he saw his mourning was now to go on again.</P>
<P>And why this ugly black, said he, to-day, when we are going to papa?—Who is dead now, aunt?</P>
<P>His aunt was so afflicted, that she could not speak a word.</P>
<P>Well then, said Abel, if you will not tell me, I will enquire of my papa.</P>
<P>At this she could no longer refrain from weeping, but burst out into a flood of tears, and said, It is he, it is he himself that is dead.</P>
<P>What, my papa dead! answered he. O heaven! take pity on me. My mama first dead! and now papa! Un∣happy as I am, and parentless! what will become of me? O my papa! mama!</P>
<P>These words were scarcely uttered, when he fell into a swoon; nor could his aunt, without much difficulty, bring him to himself again.</P>
<P>Poor child, said she, do not be thus afflicted. Your parents are still living.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; but where?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Donaldson.</SPEAKER>
<P>In heaven, with God. They are both happy in that place; and will at all times have an eye upon their child. If you are prudent, diligent, and up∣right, they will pray that God may bless you; and God certainly <HI>will</HI> bless you. This was the last prayer that your father uttered yesterday, when dying.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yesterday! when I was thinking of the pleasure that I should have in seeing him this morning.—Yesterday! Then he is not buried yet? O aunt, pray let me see him! He would not send for me, fearing to afflict me; and perhaps I, on the contrary, should have afflicted him. But now, as I cannot possibly give him any pain, I would
<PB N="11" REF="17"/>once more behold him, for the last, last time! Pray let me go and see him, my dear aunt!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Donaldson.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, we will go together, if you promise to be calm. You see my tears, and how much I am grieved for having lost my brother. He was always doing me some good or other: I was poor, and had no maintenance but what his bounty gave me. Notwith∣standing which, I yield myself, you see, to Providence that watches over us. Be calm, then, my dear child!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes; I must indeed be calm. But pray, aunt, carry me to my papa, that I may see at least his coffin.</P>

<P>Mrs. Donaldson then took him by the hand and in∣stantly went out: the day was very dark and even foggy. Abel wept as he went on.</P>
<P>When they were come before the house, the mutes were at the door, and Mr. Donaldson's late friends and neigh∣bours were standing round his coffin. They wept bitterly, and praised the integrity of the deceased. Little Abel rushed into the house, and threw himself upon the coffin. For some time he could not speak a word; but at last raised his head a little, crying out, See how your little Abel weeps for having lost you! When mama died, you consoled me, and yet wept yourself; but now, who will console me for your loss! Oh! my papa! my good papa!</P>
<P>He could utter no more: his sorrow almost strangled him. His mouth was open, and his tongue seemed mo∣tionless. His eyes at one time fixed; and at another, rolling in their sockets, had no tears to shed. His aunt had need of all her strength to pluck him from the coffin. She conducted him to a neighbour's house, begging her to keep him till his father's burial was over; for she durst not think of carrying him to see it.</P>
<P>Very soon the bell was set a tolling. Abel heard it; and the woman to whose care he had been trusted having quitted the apartment for a moment, he availed himself of the opportunity, got out, and ran that instant to the church-yard, whither the funeral was gone. The mi∣nister had finished, and the grave was filling up;—when, all at once, a cry was heard of, <HI>Bury me with my papa!</HI> and Abel jumped into the grave.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="18"/>The mourners were affected at it: Abel was drawn out all pale and speechless, and, in spite of his resistance, carried home.</P>
<P>He was for upwards of three days continually fainting; and his aunt could not bring him to be composed, even at intervals, except by speaking to him of his dear papa. At length his first excess of anguish was allayed: he wept no longer, but was very sorrowful.</P>
<P>A worthy merchant heard of this deplorable affair. He had not been without some knowledge of the father; therefore he repaired to Mrs. Donaldson, that he might see the little orphan. He was very much affected at his sadness, took him home and was a father to him. Abel soon considered himself as really the merchant's son, and every day gained greater ground in his affection. At the age of twenty, he conducted all the business of his bene∣factor with so much success, that in reality the merchant thought it his duty to assign him half the profits of it for the future; to which recompense he added his beloved daughter.—Abel hitherto had maintained his aunt out of the little perquisites belonging to him; and, by this event, he had the further happiness of making her quite easy for the remnant of her days. But never did his father's birth-day come about, but he was seized in some sort with a fever, on recalling to his memory what he once had suffered at that season; and to those sensations which then affected him did he impute the principles of honour and integrity that he ever afterwards cultivated during the whole of a long life.</P>

<HEAD>THE COMPLIMENT OF THE NEW YEAR.</HEAD>
<P>UPON a certain new-year's day, little Peregrine came into the parlour, just before breakfast was ready. He advanced, and with the greatest gravity sa∣luting his papa, began as follows, in a solemn tone of voice:</P>
<P>"As formerly the Romans were accustomed every new-year's day to wish their friends all happiness; so <HI>I,</HI> thrice honoured father, come—So <HI>I,</HI> thrice honoured father, come—come—come—"</P>
<P>The little orator at this stopped short. It was in vain; he fretted, rubbed his forehead, and began to fumble in his pocket. The remainder of this excellent harangue was not forth coming. The poor little boy was vexed, and quite in agitation. Mr. Vesey saw and pitied his embarrassment, embraced him tenderly, and said as fol∣lows: "Truly a most elegant oration! You yourself, no doubt, composed it?"</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P>No. papa; you are very good to think so, but I am not half learned enough for such a task. It was my brother that drew it up. You should have heard the whole. He told me that it was in periods; and the periods, he said, were rounded off into the bargain. Look ye, I will but run it over once, and you shall hear it then: or would you rather hear mama's? I have <HI>that</HI> perfectly, I am sure. It is extracted from the Grecian History.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Vesey.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, Peregrine, it is not necessary; and your mother and myself, without it, are as much indebted both to your affection and your brother's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, he was a fortnight, I assure you, at the work; and I employed a deal of time in learning them. What an unlucky thing that I should now forget, when I
<PB N="14" REF="20"/>most wanted to remember it! No longer ago than last night, believe me, I delivered the whole speech without the least hesitation, in the servant's room, and speaking to your wig-block, if it could but tell you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Vesey.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was then at study in my closet, and to comfort you, must say, I heard it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peregrine,</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(brighteming up:)</STAGE> Did you?—I am glad of that! and do not you think, papa, that I spoke it very well?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Vesey.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surprisingly, I must acknowledge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, but it was very fine!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Vesey.</SPEAKER>
<P>To say the truth, your brother has quite crammed it full of eloquence. And yet, I should have liked a single word or two much better from yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P>But sure, papa, to say that I wish the person to whom I am speaking a happy new year, and nothing else, is far too common to give pleasure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Vesey.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: but why then nothing else? as if, in∣stead of offering such a naked compliment, you could not previously have thought within yourself, what I wished most of all to enjoy during the course of this new year.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, that is not difficult. You wish, no doubt, to have your health, to see your family, your friends and fortune flourish, and to enjoy a deal of plea∣sure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Vesey.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; do not you wish me all this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Reregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, with all my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Vesey.</SPEAKER>
<P>What hinders then, but you could have made me up yourself a charming compliment, without requiring the assistance of another?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really, I did not think myself so learned; but it is always thus, when <HI>you</HI> instruct me; since I find out things which I did not think were in me. I can now make compliments to every one that I know. I need say nothing but what I have mentioned just this moment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Vesey.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may suit, I must acknowledge, many people; but should certainly be different with respect to others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I understand you pretty well, papa; but I do not know what the difference should be; so ex∣plain it to me, now we are alone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Vesey.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart. There are a multitude of what are called good things, that one may wish any
<PB N="15" REF="21"/>person whatsoever to enjoy; such as what you mentioned just now: there are others, that refer to different indivi∣duals according to their situations, age and duties. For example; one may wish to a man who is happy already, the long continuation of his happiness; to an unhappy man, the end of his affliction; to a man in office, that God's providence may bless his labours for the public welfare, give him necessary penetration, with the gift of perseverance to continue in them, and establish the enjoy∣ment of felicity among his countrymen, by way of re∣compence on his endeavours. To an old man one may wish a length of life exempt from every inconveniency; to children, on the other hand, the preservation of their parents, progress in their studies, with a love of arts; to parents, the completion of their hopes, in bringing up their children; every species of prosperity to such as are our benefactors: and the long continuation of their kind∣ness. It is our duty even to bethink us of our enemies, and to pray that God may show them the injustice of their conduct, and inspire them with a wish of meriting our friendship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P>O papa, how much I thank you! I have now a budget full of compliments for every one. I shall know what sort of wishes they will expect, and have no occasion for my brother's rounded periods, as he calls them: but why, as we should always have these wishes in our heart, pray tell me why the first day of the year, in preference to any other, should be pitched upon to publish them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Vesey.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because our life is, as it were, a ladder, every step of which is represented by a year. It is natural that our friends should flock together, and make merry with us, when our foot has got in safety on the step next to <HI>that</HI> which we lately trod, and to express their wish that we should climb the rest with equal safety. Do you un∣derstand me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P>O papa, quite clearly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Vesey.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is however in my power to make this clearer still, by using what we call another figure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, let us have it, pray, papa.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Vesey.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you remember, then, our going to the top of that fine church in London, called St. Paul's?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="16" REF="22"/>
<SPEAKER>Peregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! what a charming prospect from the golden gallery there! Why, you remember we could see all London and a great deal of the country from it!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Vesey.</SPEAKER>
<P>Greenwich hospital particularly struck your eye; and as you could not then have any notion of the distance, you proposed that we should the following week go there on foot to dinner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, papa; and did I not, pray, walk the whole long journey like a man?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Vesey.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, well enough. I had no reason to find fault with your performance; but remember, I took care, at every mile-stone on the road, to make you sit and rest a little.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P>So you did indeed; and it was in my opi∣nion, no bad idea at the first, to put up those figured stones beside the road. One knows at any time what dis∣tance one has walked, how much is still to come, and so regulates one's pace accordingly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Vesey.</SPEAKER>
<P>In this you have yourself explained the ad∣vantages which arise from our dividing life into those equal portions that we call years: for every year is some∣thing like a mile-stone in the road of life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peregrine</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand you. And the seasons are, per∣haps, so many quarter-miles, which tell us that we shall very soon arrive at the next stone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Vesey.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your observation is extremely just; and I am glad that this little journey is still fresh in your re∣membrance. If you take it in a proper point of view, it will exhibit a true picture of life. Remember, if you can, the different circumstances that took place while you were posting on to Greenwich; tell them in the order in which they fell out, as well as you are able, and I will make the application.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should scarce remember the whole business better, had it happened yesterday. At first, as I was full of spirits and desired to let you see it, I set out upon a trot and made a number of trips; I do not well know how many. You advised me to go slowly, as the journey would be rather long. I followed your advice and had no reason to repent. Upon the way, I asked for informa∣tion at the sight of every thing of which I did not know the meaning, and you were pleased to tell me. When we happened to go by a bit of grass, we sat down on it, and
<PB N="17" REF="23"/>you read a story-book that you had brought out in your pocket to divert me. Then we got upon our feet again; and as we went along, you told me many other things not only useful but diverting likewise. In this manner, though the weather was not altogether fine, though we had sometimes rain, and once a hail-storm to encounter, we arrived at Greenwich, I remember, very fresh and hearty, and made afterwards a charming dinner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Vesey.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very faithfully related, Peregrine! but for some few circumstances, which, however, I am glad you have not introduced; as for example, your attention to a poor blind man whom you caught by the arm, if you re∣member, to prevent him from falling upon a heap of stones that lay before him, and on which he might have broke his legs; the assistance that you afforded a poor washer woman's boy, by picking up a handkerchief of linen which had fallen out of the cart; but particularly the alms that you gave to several people on the road.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you think, then, papa, that I forgot them? I know that we should not boast of any good, that we may have had the opportunity of doing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Vesey.</SPEAKER>
<P>And on that account, I am greatly pleased in dwelling on it, as a recompence for so much modesty. It is just that I should repay you some small portion of the joy which you caused me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! I saw tears rolling in your eye, not once alone, nor twice, but often. I was so delighted! if you knew how much that sight made me forget my weari∣ness! I walked much the better for it. But let me have the application that you just mentioned.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Vesey.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is as follows, Peregrine. Give me all the attention in your power.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fear nothing. I will not lose a syllable, sir, of what you tell me, I assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Vesey.</SPEAKER>
<P>The look, then, which you cast round you from the golden gallery, all over London, and a great deal, as you mentioned, of the country, is expressive of the first reflexions of a child upon the multitude about him. The long walk that you chose to Greenwich, is the journey which we propose to ourselves through life. The eagerness with which you wished to hurry on at set∣ting out, without consulting your ability for running, and which cost you such repeated trips, is the natural
<PB N="18" REF="24"/>impetuosity of youth which would excite us to the worst excesses, if a faithful and experienced friend were not to moderate it. The instruction that you derived, as we were walking on, from reading and conversing with me, and the actions of good-will and charity that you per∣formed, took off from the fatigue of such a journey; and you finished it thereby with satisfaction to yourself, though there had fallen a deal of rain, and even hail. These circumstances, too, convey instruction; for in life there are no other means than the performance of our duty, to keep off disquietude and to cherish peace within us, notwithstanding those vicissitudes of fortune which would otherwise, perhaps, go near to overwhelm us: and the comfortable meal that we made at the conclusion of our journey is no other than an emblem of the recom∣pence which God gives us when we die, to crown those virtuous actions that we have laboured to perform while in this world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, papa; all this squares wonderfully well, and I shall have a deal of happiness, I see before∣hand, in the year that is now begun.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Vesey.</SPEAKER>
<P>It rests with yourself alone to make the year quite happy; but once more, let us return to our excur∣sion. Do you recollect when in going round, that we might see a little of the park, we came upon Blackheath? The heavens were then serene, and we could see behind us all the way that we had been walking.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, indeed, papa! and I was proud of having walked so far!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Vesey.</SPEAKER>
<P>By <HI>proud,</HI> you mean rejoiced. Are you then equally rejoiced at present, while your reason which now dawns within you, pauses and cast back a look upon the way that you have already made in life? You entered it quite weak and naked, without any means of making, in the least degree, provision for your wants. It was your mother who gave you your first food, and it is I that have the forethought to subsist you. How do we desire you to repay us? We want nothing more, than that you should yourself endeavour to be happy, by becoming just and honest; by acquiring a due notion of your several duties; and by seriously intending to discharge them. Have you then fulfilled these few conditions, no less advantageous to yourself than easy? Have you first of all been grateful
<PB N="19" REF="25"/>to God's goodness, who has willed that you should be born of parents possessing wherewithal to bring you up in ease and honour? Have you always shewn those parents the obedience and respect that you owe them? Have you paid attention to the precepts of your teachers? Have you never given occasion for your brothers or your sisters to com∣plain of envy or injustice in you? Have you always treated those who wait upon you, with a proper sort of conde∣scension, and at no time claimed from their inferior situa∣tion, what it was their duty to refuse you? In a word, do you possess that love of justice, that equality of con∣duct, and that moderation which we, by our instruction and example, are at all times doing what we can to set before you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, papa, let us not look so much at what is past, but to the future. Every thing that I should have done, I promise by God's blessing to do hereafter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Vesey.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is well said: embrace me, therefore, Peregrine. I accept your promise, and confine to its per∣formance all the wishes that I need make, on my side, for your happiness, on this renewal of the year.</P>

<P>SO early with us, Master Charles?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Archibald; and what is more, I want to speak with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>With me, sir? What can occasion me the honour of your visit?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>What except the pleasure, Archibald, of see∣ing you? The truth however is, that I am come to know what Christmas-boxes you have had.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Christmas-boxes, do you ask me? If my mother, sister and myself have but the necessary things of life, we are content.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>But Mr. Damer, surely, lets you want for nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, indeed, we are his debtors for whatever we possess, and he continues in our favour the respect, as I may call it, that he had for my poor father; and his son, too, has a friendship for us. Do you see, sir, this new suit of clothes upon me? it is Edward's pre∣sent. It was bought for him, but his papa permitted him to give it me, by way of Christmas-box. He has pre∣vailed
<PB N="21" REF="27"/>too on Miss Veronica to present my sister with a few of her cast clothes; and we were last night very happy in receiving them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose so; but if you talk of Christmas∣boxes, it is he that has received some fine ones no doubt!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly, his father is so rich! and yet, I know not if his pleasure was as great as ours. Fine things are no novelties to him. And what we may receive, whenever we think proper, never gives us so much joy as what <HI>they</HI> feel to whom their benefactors unexpectedly make presents.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I agree with you in this: but cannot you tell me what Edward has received? No doubt he has shown you all his presents.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, that he has indeed: but how shall I remember the whole catalogue? Let me reflect a little. In the first place, he has had some books, a case of mathe∣matical instruments, a microscope, silk stockings, and a set of silver buttons for a suit of clothes, compleat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>But those are not the things that I mean. What I want to know about, friend Archibald, are the sweetmeats and nice things, that generally are presented, at this season of the year, to children of our age.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! his papa has given him no such things: he says that sweetmeats do but rot the teeth; and as for play-things, certainly Edward is too big, to wish for such matters. It is only from his aunt that he received trifles of this sort. She, indeed, has given him some of what you mention.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay! and what for instance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can I remember them? There is in the first place, a great cake; a quantity of candied orange peel; some capillaire; and sweetmeats; half-a-dozen companies of French and English soldiers, cast in lead, and in their uniforms; a draft-board; fish and counters; and about a dozen china figures made in Derbyshire. But rather go and speak to him yourself. He will show you every thing that he has received. Why do you put these several questions to me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! I know what I am doing. I had my reasons for interrogating you, before I went up stairs into Edward's room.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="22" REF="28"/>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what, pray, are those reasons? May I know?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I had determined never to reveal them: but, provided you will but be secret—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am no prater.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then give me your promise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is my hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, I will tell you, as a secret that I would have you keep, Edward is finely taken in!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>Edward finely taken in! my friend? I can∣not endure such language.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I will tell you nothing. I am still mas∣ter of my secret; you know that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, Charles! And can you wrong, then, my dear friend Edward at this rate?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! be assured, I shall not wrong him person∣ally: but I speak of an affair in which we both have come to an agreement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, if taken in, he is deceived.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no: he has deceived himself entirely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not understand a word of this enigma.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will explain the matter to you. We had previously agreed to go equal sharers in our Christmas∣boxes, whatsoever they might be, respecting every thing that in its nature was divisible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, pray, and can he lose by such a bar∣gain? His papa is not so rich as yours. Your Christmas∣boxes therefore must, at least in point of value, equal his, and very probably exceed them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, indeed, I have received a very handsome Christmas-box. This watch, for instance; but a watch, you know, cannot be divided.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>On your honour, you have had no other present?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing, I assure you, but a cake and two small boxes of preserves. My father says, as Mr. Damer does, that sweetmeats hurt one. While mama was living it was quite another thing, for then I had such delicacies in abundance; and Edward knows as much, who saw my last year's Christmas-boxes. It was this that induced him to make such a bargain with me; and last week too, we confirmed it on our word. You see, then—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="23" REF="29"/>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I see too clearly, that Edward is to be your dupe. He will have only half a cake and some pre∣serves for what he is to give you up. It is true, his aunt has sent him more than he can eat. But is it true then, Master Charles, that you had nothing else? I must con∣fess, I find it very difficult to credit your assertion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Difficult to credit my assertion! Shall I swear, then, to the truth of what I say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>Swear! Fye! Should a little gentleman, as you are, think of swearing in this matter? It is entirely your affair; and if you are deceiving my good friend Ed∣ward, you will lose much more than he, Charles.</P>
</SP>

<P>But, Archibald, do you know that I do not approve of such remonstrances? It is Edward's business to reflect on the affair. Suppose Edward had received no Christmas-box?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>There was no fear of that. His friends are generous, and Edward's conduct pleases them. Your Christmas-box is such a trifle! It would be quite unhand∣some in you, to expect that Edward should have all the disadvantage on his side; and therefore we must go and tell him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! that is done already. Late last night I sent him half the cake that I received, and part of my pre∣serves. I have likewise written him a little letter on the subject.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then, you will persist in your demand upon him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray what would you do, in my situa∣tion? You that talk so much!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would have nothing from him, having nothing upon my side to bestow; and therefore quit him of his promise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! your humble servant! Keep your counsel to yourself. Our bargain is a wager; and when people think of laying wagers, it is that they may win. Next year it shall be as he pleases; but at present, if he does not give me half of every thing that he has received, his cake, his orange-peel, his sweetmeats, soldiers, fish and counters, china ware, and any thing else that you may have forgot to mention, I will follow him through all the streets, courts, lanes, and every thoroughfare in London, and proclaim him for a cheat. Yes, tell him that from
<PB N="24" REF="30"/>me, friend Archibald; and, that such as we should keep our promise, after we have sworn to one another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>After you have sworn! Fie, fie upon your oaths! I am very poor; and yet, if you would give me all the Christmas-boxes that ever you received, not ex∣cepting even your fine watch, I would not swear in such a trifling matter. It should be a very solemn business only that would make me take an oath.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Archibald, you are a downright sim∣pleton. Without this swearing, how should any one be bound to keep his promise?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you ask that seriously? His very promise should compel him to observe it, and the word of honest people be as sacred as an oath. If you judge otherwise, I do not know what I am to think of you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is your idea, then, that Edward will be faithful to his promise?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>My idea? Should he break it, insignificant as I must own myself, I would never look upon him as long as I have breath. But no, he will not break it; and to keep his word, will have no manner of occasion for an oath.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>That we shall see. However, tell him every thing that I have said, that he may act accordingly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>I need tell him nothing. He does not want a monitor to do his duty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray add, I wish him joy that he is so finely taken in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then, you would insult, as well as—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>No: but I divert myself at his expence, as he would do at mine. Let him alone! Another time, if he thinks proper, he may be revenged.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; this is the only business of the kind that ever he will tranfact with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>As he pleases. I have wherewithal, by this day's lucky business, to console myself.
<STAGE>(<HI>He goes out.</HI>)</STAGE></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald,</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(<HI>alone.</HI>)</STAGE> I could not have imagined Charles so mercenary. If, in truth, he has no more than what he tells me from his father, why then did he not break off the bargain, when he found it likely to press so hard upon his friend?

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have learned what it contains. But pray how came you to make such a bargain? Certainly you should have first asked leave of your papa and aunt, since what your parents and relations give you should not be disposed of without their consent.</P>

<P>That is true; but it is done.</P>

<P>Ah, ah! I understand the matter. You de∣signed to dupe him then; therefore you are punished with justice.</P>
</SP>

<P>Had I been contented with my own!</P>

<P>Well, no complaints, Edward. Is not your half still sufficient for you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>So you fancy—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not go on. Edward means to ask me if he ought to keep his word.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>But are you certain that every thing was fair and open on the part of Charles?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think him honest, since he told me so him∣self; and it is my practice to think well of every one, till he has once deceived me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how happens it that his father should have been so sparing towards him? Every former Christmas he has had a store of presents.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>They were his mama's; and now she is dead, his father thinks as yours does, and instead of childish toys, has bought him a fine watch.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes; I know it. He will conceal what ought to be divided, of his presents, and yet <HI>I</HI> must give him up half mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>Should he behave so; he would be a knave.</P>
</SP>

<P>And should I, in that case; be bound to keep my promise with him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="26" REF="32"/>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is this question, my good friend Ed∣ward? Just as if you were to ask me, whether, if he proves a cheat, you might not be so likewise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, unless I tell him, he will never know what I have had.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>And can you hide this knowledge from your∣self?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I have hardly had, from my papa, more things that can be shared, than he. The rest, you know, were from my aunt.</P>

<P>Did you except what any one but your papa might give you, in your bargain?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I think fit to take it, to be sure I may; but what can force me, if I do not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your honour. Should you be so shameful as to break your word, then Charles will certainly expose your conduct, and with justice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! I do not mind that a rush. I will answer him at any time. But how, pray, will he be convinced that I have broke my word?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>He knows, already, every thing that you have received. I told him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, and can you have betrayed me, Archi∣bald?—I will preserve no future friendship with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should die with grief, if I had willingly betrayed you, dear Edward; I can very easily excuse my conduct, by declaring, that before I knew of your agree∣ment, Charles contrived to take me by surprize. But if it were not so, and he had called upon me to speak truth, I must have done it. To be honest, one should no more lie than break one's word.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>You take his part against me! and shall I be still your friend? No, no!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>As you please. I know what it must cost me if I lose your friendship, which is much more precious to me than even all the gifts that your family have heaped upon me; but at every risque, I have no other counsel
<PB N="27" REF="33"/>for you: and although you should not rest my friend, no∣thing shall keep me, while I live, from being yours.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>And then would you have claimed your bar∣gain from Charles?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would I?—What a question!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then would you not fulfil it on your part, and show that you can be just, when the conditions are so easy?</P>
</SP>

<P>Are so easy? What! the loss of half my pro∣perty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you not the other half still left? Well then, imagine yourself to have received no more; but think particularly how much reputation such an action will procure you in men's eyes, when they observe that you put no value upon what the generality of children so fondly prize, but can scorn them when your word is to be kept. As many as are told of your fidelity will love you. Grant∣ing Charles designs to trick you, I am sure, he will never have the courage afterwards to look you in the face; whereas, upon the other hand, you will walk before him with your head up, sure of the esteem of all good people. Yes, my dear Edward, let us always deal uprightly, what∣soever price it costs us. Ah! if I were rich, you should not have to mourn your loss a moment upon this occasion. I would give you every thing in my possession to make you amends.</P>
</SP>

I will look with scorn upon the baubles that had charms enough, as I ima∣gined, to corrupt me: so let Charles directly have his share, and you yourself shall halve them; give him what you please. I only desire that you would not scorn me for indulging such mean thoughts: I will be henceforth wor∣thy your esteem and friendship.</P>

<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you are so. You were never worthier of it than at present. I was well acquainted with your heart, and knew what measures you would take. This conquest of yourself will cause you much more satisfaction than the trifles that you give up: when some few days are passed, they would have lost their charms, and you would certainly have given the whole away at once, to any child that should have wanted them.</P>

<P><STAGE>(<HI>returning after a few minutes absence.</HI>)</STAGE> I could not possibly prevail upon her to come back; but she would go and tell papa.—In fact, she is in the right.—If my papa and aunt forbid me, I keep every thing, and do not break my word. I wonder that this idea did not sooner strike me. It is indeed unjust in some degree; and there is a voice within me that condemns it. I should not have entered into this agreement, without thinking of each separate circumstance, and guarding properly against them. I wish Archibald were but here, to fix me one way or ano∣ther. I am at a loss for his counsel. When he comes, I hope it will be alone. Ah! here he is; and as I wished to have it, no one is with him.</P>

<P>Charles will very soon be here. He is gone to ask his father's leave for coming. Be of courage, dear Edward; nor let Charles suspect that these play-things are of any value to you. I begin to think he does not deal with you upon the square in this transaction. I spoke to him rather seriously; and by his answers, he appeared embarrassed.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I will try to conquer my reluctance in this point, and put on a good face before him; but would any one conceive what Veronica told me not ten minutes since? That I should beg papa or aunt to lay their orders
<PB N="34" REF="40"/>on me, who would certainly forbid my giving any thing away; and thus I should preserve my Christmas-box and reputation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>And your peace of mind;—would you pre∣serve that likewise?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, indeed. I even thought, while she was speaking, how disgraceful such an application would be to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then hesitate a moment longer? O, my dear Edward! let us never stifle those first whisperings of integrity and generosity that may be heard within us. You will soon experience how much inward satisfaction flows from listening to them. Have we any real need of these poor gimcracks here, to make us happy? Oh! when you have parted with them, I will be more industrious to procure you other sources of amusement. If my friend∣ship is of any value to you, be assured I shall esteem you ten times more, if you consult your honour in this matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. I will do so, dear Archibald, and be proud of yielding to your counsel, as in every other matter, so in this too. I will follow it, however Veronica may persuade me to do otherwise. These <HI>gimcracks</HI>—as you call them. Out upon such childishnesses! for to prove how truly I despise them, look, I will add my two remaining sweet-meat bags to Charles's.—There—they shall be mine no longer.</P>

<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. What I am now to do, I do with all my heart. <STAGE>(<HI>He takes Charles by the hand, and brings him to the table.</HI>)</STAGE> So look ye; here are all my presents: we first halved them pretty nearly; after which I added something to your share, that you might have no reason to com∣plain.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>Two articles, the microscope and draft-board could not be divided. By the terms of your agreement, therefore, your friend might have kept them both; but he has honourably chosen to give up the draft-board; and accordingly I put it to your share.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry Charles, that these china figures could not be divided equally. I have kept the <HI>Muses:</HI> but because the <HI>Seasons</HI> were less valuable, I have added to them all the fish and counters in this bag, which were my own.

<P>How! When you bestow upon me half your things, without expecting any in return from me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; no: you must not thus applaud my ge∣nerosity. You cannot imagine how reluctantly at first I parted with this half; and had it not been for the exhor∣tation that Archibald gave me to so good a work, I should not have kept my word after all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>And to him I am indebted likewise for the satisfaction of not having quite compleated my unworthy tricking scheme. He set the baseness of it in so full a light before me! And when afterward I entered here, and found with how much generosity you had proceeded in your distribution—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>In my distribution! It is Archibald that has all the merit of it. I cannot tell what happy art he has; but to deprive myself of what I had beforehand so much cherished, was a pleasure to me. Yet there is some∣thing in your share that I added of myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you shall keep the whole: for I will have nothing of it, and am happy to get rid of such a burthen. I should never have presumed to look you in the face. I could not think how much one suffers by becoming a dis∣honest man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how was I tormented also? But at present I experience how much pleasure flows from gene∣rosity.
<PB N="38" REF="44"/>All this is due to Archibald. So necessitous, and yet so upright! Sure he could not claim a recompence for telling you my Christmas-boxes?</P>

<P>Ah, if you had heard how handsomely he spoke about you, and espoused your interests in our con∣versation! I had need of all my art and cunning to get from him what you had received. And therefore, hence∣forth he shall have what he has merited so well, my friend∣ship: and I will give him the remaining half of my three guineas.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>No, no, Charles; leave me to recompense him as I well know how: and keep your money, with the half that is yours, of my Christmas-boxes.</P>

<P>What? I keep it? Never. Look ye; rather let us give him every thing that we should have shared between us. We have well deserved to lose, and he to have it.</P>

<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, with all my heart. And do you know what you must do? We have it in our power to please him very much. I will order all these things upon the table to be carried to his mother's; so that he may see them there, the first time he goes home.</P>

<P>It would have been impossible for me to conceal them from her; I chose therefore to make them in concert with her, while she supposed that she should surprize you agreeably with this revel at your return.

<P>And I have brought my future son in law, Lieut. Boardham, who behaved so gallantly, you remem∣ber, during the war. What recommended him to my notice, was his attacking a pirate sloop in the East-Indies with no more than an armed boat, and taking her. These Turkish dresses were part of her spoils, and we put them on for this frolic, the better to disguise ourselves. Oh! I forgot to mention too, that I have brought a band of music from Portsmouth. I left them to refresh themselves at a public house close by our park: here, within a stone's throw of us.</P>

<P>I think, Madam, it would affect you in a pleasing manner, to see the impatience with which all the neighbourhood waits his arrival.

There came some of those cursed Hussars. In an hour's time there was not a single hedge left standing in all that part of the country. Then the statues in our garden, your Apollos, your Jupiters, and your Mercuries, those they soon turned topsy-turvy. I should not have cared a straw for them; but my poor me∣lons! my poor asparagus! it grieved me to the heart to see them demolished. And yet I was not the head gardener neither. Now that I am gardener in chief, only think if that was to happen. I should throw myself head foremost into the draw-well. But come, a fig for those madcaps. It is peace timenow; huzza!

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>But friend Matthews, at your age—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matthews.</SPEAKER>
<P>My age is the cause why I have more obli∣gation to him than the young ones. I know the Commo∣dore, madam, longer than you do. Many a time have I set him a riding upon this very stick. He was not so big as master Constantine here, when he began to be my be∣nefactor. I was poor then, and he had no more than his pocket-money. Well, he found means to relieve me out of many difficulties even with that. It was in vain that I told him only half of my distress. He could guess more than I could hide from him. As soon as he came to his estate, he made me a present of the cottage that I inhabit, and let me some lands which are round about it, but on so favourable a lease that I soon got above the world. Thanks to his friendship, I have been able to bring up all my children, and to settle them easily in the world, which as I have done through his means, I count them as much his family as mine, and love them the better on that score.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know his friendship for you continues still. There are few of his letters in which he does not mention you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matthews, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(overjoyed.)</STAGE>
<P>Is it possible! But I believe it, and it is no more than he ought. For why? he has done good to a great many of his tenants; he has rebuilt their cottages when thrown down by storms, or burnt; he has helped them in bad seasons; he has forgiven them their rent. Let them bless him, let them love him, let them revere him; but I should be main vexed if I thought, that
<PB N="60" REF="66"/>next to his family, any body loved him better than I do. I mean the same to you, madam; and to you also, miss.</P>

<HEAD>WAR AND PEACE.</HEAD>
<P>Commodore Freeport, still agitated with the pleasing sensations that he experienced during the course of the day, could not close his eyes till long after midnight, when at length a grateful slumber stole upon him, and soft dreams composed his agitated bosom. In the morn∣ing, the first objects that he beheld about him were his children, who had placed themselves around his bed in expectation of his waking. He received their sweet ca∣resses, clasped them tenderly himself, and putting on his clothes as quickly as he could, went down into the garden with them.</P>
<P>The serenity then reigning round about, the pleasure of revisiting those places which his own hands had culti∣vated in times past, and of being once again restored in safety to his family, when such an interval of separation had elapsed, and even the recollection of the dangers to which he had often been exposed, every thing inspired him with unspeakable affection; and his children, sensible of this, employed the opportunity to ask him question after question.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="71"/>He gave a relation of every thing worth knowing, that had happened to him in his many and perilous voyages, of the storms that had attacked his ships, and the ha∣zardous expeditions in which he was concerned. He de∣scribed to them the solitary uninhabited regions visited by his people, and, on the other hand, the populous nations that he had seen, together with their customs, characters, and manners.</P>
<P>During his recital, he was careful to remark what sort of feelings it excited in their hearts, and what was the expression of those feelings on their countenances. At the slightest mention of the dangers that he had encountered, he felt the little girls, by instinct as it were, press tenderly to him: they sighed, and now and then let fall a tear; while Constantine, his son, was animated, and seemed ready, or at least his features spoke him ready, to en∣counter the same degree of danger. In particular, at the recital of any warlike action, you might see his breast heave, and his eyes sparkle like fire.</P>
<P>Papa, cried he at length, if I were but as big as you, how I should like to go to war, that, in my turn, I might appear as brave a man as you.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Com. Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Constantine, you know not what a cruel wish you indulge now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Constant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, papa! do not you mean me for a sol∣dier?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Com. Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I do, indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Constant.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is not the profession of a soldier neces∣sary?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Com. Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Too much so, I must confess. It is with a kingdom just the same as with a human body. Both are subject to interior maladies, and outward accidents. The physician watches the body carefully, to prevent com∣plaints within it, which might happen through the fer∣mentation of sharp humours, or to save it from those ills that it might sustain from hurtful objects. Just so, like∣wise, does the soldier watch the state, of which he is a member, to suppress seditions that might rise within it, and repel the invasion of ambitious nations dwelling round about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Constant.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, papa, if the profession of a soldier be so necessary, ought not I to wish for opportunities of exer∣cising it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="66" REF="72"/>
<SPEAKER>Com. Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>What would you think of that physician, who, impressed with a desire of practising his art, should wish a dangerous malady, a plague for instance, or something like it, to befal his fellow-creatures?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Constant.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, papa, how wicked!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Com. Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then must I think of him, who, to gratify a principle of pride, or ambition, should desire to see the greatest scourge that can attend on human nature lay waste his country?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! Constantine, think of that, and let us see what you will answer!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Constant.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet war, papa, is quite delightful, and particularly if one were a king.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Com. Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>In what, then, do you think it so delightful?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Constant.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the first place, because then a king may make himself more powerful.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Com. Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be it granted, kings may have recourse to war with justice. But when they wish to have more power, do you imagine that in prudence they should do so; that is, go to war? Suppose within yourselves, dear children, that the lands about my estate here were as many little empires, and their owners, Mr. Marchmont and the rest, as many kings within them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, like those of France and England. Do you understand?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Constant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't be uneasy, sister, upon my account. I understand extremely well. Pray, dear papa, go on!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Com. Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I prevail upon my tenants to take arms, and if they can obtain possession of a field belonging, as I said just now, to Mr. Marchmont, is it not pretty likely that Mr. Marchmont will give his tenants arms, and beg them to defend that field, which they must know is his; and very possibly encourage them to seize on something that belongs to me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, that is quite natural.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Com. Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>If so, then I am plunged into a sea of trou∣ble, and must always be upon the watch, that I may rob my neighbour, or prevent his robbing me. Of which the consequence is this: if I prosper, I must reasonably fear that my neighbours will conspire together to im∣pede my further violences; and divide my spoils, if I am beaten.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="67" REF="73"/>
<SPEAKER>Constant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, papa; but then, the glory that you would gain, by letting all the neighbours see how brave you are!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Com. Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand you; and to gain this glory, which at best is but imaginary, I shall go and hazard the repose and life of those whom I ought to regard as my children! But it is very possible that my neighbour may be braver by a deal than I; what then shall I have gained by this fantastic wish of glory?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Constant.</SPEAKER>
<P>As I take it, you should previously provide yourself with such a force, as to be sure of conquest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Com. Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>I might still reply, by hinting that my neigh∣bour certainly would take the same advantages, might possibly be more successful, and so make my enterprising disposition cost me dear at last. But for the sake of argu∣ment, Constantine, I will suppose that fortune favours me, and my estate is much enlarged: alas! this very cir∣cumstance, in all probability, may become my ruin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Constant.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, papa? Methinks you would become the richer for it. With a greater quantity of land, you would have much more money coming in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Com. Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Constantine! it is not on the size of an estate that its worth depends, but on the care which one takes to cultivate it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly; for only think of Wilsdon-heath, where Mr. Bramble lives. Why, no one in his senses would give up the fourth part of such an orchard as we have for all that heath.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>I easily believe you. Wilsdon-heath produces only furze and thorns, while our orchard bears a deal of fruit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Constant.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what would hinder you from cultivating all the land that you might have taken from your neigh∣bour?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Com. Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I have before hand lost in the dispute a number of my tenants, and a portion of the rest are still employed in arms, who then will cultivate my fields? I shall notwithstanding, in the interval, be obliged to feed those men who have forsaken agriculture, and who, in∣stead of following it, are occupied in laying waste the ground on which they tread. Now, to feed them, I must put fresh burdens upon those that still remain employed in cultivating my estate, and make them pay me largerrents.
<PB N="68" REF="74"/>If I impose upon them, they will leave their farms, and chuse more kind and peaceful landlords than myself. Of course, I shall have none about me but armed tenants. who, if ever they conceive themselves ill treated, will be likely to conspire against me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Constant.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have read, indeed, such things in history: my tutor very lately, I remember, pointed one out to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Com. Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us now, on the other hand, suppose, Constantine, that instead of vexing any of the nations round me; for I drop the idea of a landlord and speak as if I were the king of England and alluded to the king of France; suppose, I say, that instead of vexing any of the king of France's subjects, I should do my utmost to attach them to me by a commerce advantageous both to them and my own people, and by being scrupulously careful to prevent whatever might oceasion, for the time to come, division and dispute between us; and should give encou∣ragement, within my own dominions, to the arts of agri∣culture, so that every one of my subjects might enjoy, if he thought fit, the sweets of peace, and that serenity which always flows from justice; should I not be happier, through the happiness of every one about me, than from any boast of having conquered? And in that case, would not my dominion be established on a much more solid base than if I had enlarged its limits, when the consequence must be, that every part becomes much weaker?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Constant.</SPEAKER>
<P>But papa, do not you remember that you compared, just now, a kingdom to a human body? If a human body then, like mine, grows stronger every day as it grows bigger, sure a kingdom must become more powerful in proportion as its size increases.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Com. Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it would do, I confess, if that increase were carried forward, as it is in nature, by a slow and gradual rate, and not in consequence of sudden revolutions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Constant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, explain this last particular.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Com. Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will make it clearly understood, by what I saw take place between a little boy and girl, on board the ship in which I came to England.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Constant.</SPEAKER>
<P>What you saw take place between a little boy and girl? I cannot conceive how any thing like that can be of use in settling this affair!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Com. Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>One evening, their mama gave each of them a piece of cake. The girl was less a great deal than her
<PB N="69" REF="75"/>brother, and had notwithstanding very near as large a piece. The boy remarked that circumstance, and snatched her share away. Now, what do you imagine led him to this action of injustice?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Constant.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose he thought it wrong that his sister, being less than he, should have a piece almost as large.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! what a mighty man!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Com. Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Exactly such is the pretext assigned in general by all conquerors. But what happened to the little boy? When he had finished eating, he grew sick. The aliments that we swallow, being meant to strengthen us, it is very natural to fancy that the more we take the stronger we shall be: so also it is not unnatural for a child to fancy that a prince, whose territories are increased, should find his power increased in proportion. But in reality, it is with a kingdom just as with our stomach. Being over∣charged, it must be out of order. If the little boy had been contented with the piece that he had received, (for you must know he was an ailing child, and therefore had not so much as his sister who was very hearty,) it would have digested properly and strengthened him; whereas, by eating more than he could bear, it had the effect upon him which I have just now mentioned. If his sister, fol∣lowing the example that he had set her, had proceeded upon this to take away his bit of cake by force, as little as she was, he would not have had sufficient strength to save it from her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Constant.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, perhaps, he would have thought of the injustice that he had done, and yielded it without a struggle?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Com. Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a generosity of which the common sort of conquerors are not capable to one another. If they were but so in favour of their subjects only, how could they reflect upon the multitude of victims which they must sacrifice upon the altar of their vengeance or ambition, the first time they combat with the people whom they have made their enemies, and not be struck with horror at the thought? I should imagine it would be well, if kings, upon the point of undertaking any war, should have a picture hung before them, setting forth the horrors of that war, so that their fancies might be incessantly affected with the idea of it; and at midnight, when all nature otherwise is still about them, might hear the groans of
<PB N="70" REF="76"/>wounded men reproaching them as the occasion of those pains which they suffer, the despairing cries of wives and mothers loading them with curses, and the clamours of a people famishing for want of bread. Their souls are some∣times wrought on, by unjust solicitations, to grant crimi∣nals their life; and yet they sign, without remorse, what shall condemn to death even thousands of their unoffend∣ing subjects. A good king employs whole years in medi∣tating on a project that may finally prove beneficial to some portion of his state, to population, trade, or agriculture. Twenty years shall pass away before the pro∣ject is perfected; while a warlike, that is, cruel king shall, by the resolution of a moment, half exterminate his people, put a stop to agriculture, tie up the industrious hands of artizans, deprive the poor of their subsistence by depriving them of daily work, reduce whole families to dissolution, and at last entirely overthrow his realm!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Constant.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, papa, I have often heard that great fortunes are made by hundreds, in the time of war.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Com. Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>And this is an addition to the evils which it foments; for, not to speak of those antipathies which the inequality of wealth produces in the hearts of such as are each other's neighbours, those enormous fortunes cherish a degree of luxury that cannot but corrupt men's manners to the last excess. The pomp with which it is surrounded, the enjoyment which it procures, the shameful deference or respect which men dare not, if they would, refuse it, stimulate the generality of those who are upon an equal footing in regard to rank with the luxurious, but less wealthy, to affect it with the same indecency, that they may either satisfy their pride or keep up their respectabi∣lity. They waste their real wealth in keeping up their luxury, that they may gain possession of that shadowy wealth which they fancy they <HI>shall</HI> get. Intimidated by the dread of their approaching ruin, if they do not hasten to prevent it by unlawful methods, they embark in dan∣gerous enterprises, and expose not only their own pro∣perty, but whatever may be entrusted in their hands by others whom the hope of a fallacious profit will inveigle to be partners in their schemes. Their ruin is at last an∣nounced; but the example will not terrify cupidity which always hopes to prosper more than others, by employing subtler artifices: and as soon as probity is given up, then
<PB N="71" REF="77"/>mutual trust is banished, and a nation's commerce perishes through the excess of that abundance which it created.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Constant.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if any land grows rich by peace, should we not always have sufficient cause to fear the same mis∣fortune?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Com. Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all. It is only suddenly made fortunes that intoxicate the minds of their possessors, and excite them to abuse their wealth. Fortunes gradually gained, or in the ordinary course of commerce, are in consequence of many years consumed in toil. Men hardly ever dissi∣pate the treasure which they have laboured hard to ac∣quire, but lay it by, to serve them in the wearisome con∣dition of old age: besides, their fortunes are, in that case, much more equable, and every one is rich, while no one overflows with wealth. The country, having far less wants in that serenity with which commerce blesses it, is not under the necessity of grinding the laborious hus∣bandman; but, on the contrary, is able to encourage him in furnishing the trading part of the community with those supplies of corn and other fruits of the earth which it re∣quires.—An empire strengthened thus by trade and agri∣culture, may give laws to other empires, even on account of its tranquillity. Its neighbours fear it, and instead of making inroads on a people who must be too powerful for them, seek alliance with that people. This alliance draws mankind together, roots out national antipathies, and kindles sentiments of unity and concord in their stead. The prince has only to prevent abuses in the state. A perfect legislation causes justice and strict order to prevail among his people, and they pass from individuals to whole states. Trade, arts, and sciences, may be compared to bridges that extend from one to the other, and on which not only Peace, but Plenty, constantly walk to and fro, that they may keep inviolate the happiness of those whom they have united.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Constant.</SPEAKER>
<P>I conceive your meaning pretty clearly: yet, in case there be no war, then soldiers are unnecessary, and my regiment must be broke before I join it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Com. Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not so fast, Constantine; for an undefended state would be exposed, by reason of its riches, to a mul∣titude of enemies. It should keep up a regulated force in peace, if it would have one in the time of war. But then, instead of looking on an unconcerned spectator,
<PB N="72" REF="78"/>while the military quench their spirit in debauchery and sloth, it should assign them labours to keep up their strength, and make them useful to the state. They should be stationed on the public roads, and such as are employed at present on them never quit the plow and sickle: an additional connexion would, in that case, forcibly unite them to their country, in that natural propensity which men feel to value what their industry in some sort has created, and the pride with which they are at all times ready to defend it. The superior officer, who should di∣rect their labours, would not, we must own, observe his name recorded in the papers of the day, and no where else, for trifling enterprises, such as history descends not to perpetuate; but would himself engrave it on a pillar, raised upon the spot where once ascended a high hill that he should have levelled, on the side of a canal or post that he should have dug, or at the opening of a bridge that he should have built. The traveller then would come from the remotest part of Europe to consider the magnificence and boldness of his toil, his countrymen would bless the benefits accruing from it, and a generation not then born, would in future time rise up, and wonder at its durability. The colour of his coat no longer would excite one thought of bloodshed, but of gratitude, so justly due to benefits, and of respect invariably paid to the ingenious. His lei∣sure moments would be spent in the extension of those sciences which he had formerly studied, and in suggesting plans of policy, resulting from his observations made in different countries. Retiring in the end, to pass away the residue of life on his estate with honour, in the recol∣lection of those benefits which he had communicated to his country, his activity would flourish still in agriculture. I even dare propose myself as an example. I am inclined to think that I have been serviceable to my king in India; but shall much more boast of benefiting for the time to come my native land, by cultivating the inheritance which a father left me, and by giving you, my children, a be∣coming education. I shall do my utmost to atone for any involuntary violence that I may have done humanity, by being henceforth a protector of the needy round about me; and I hope I shall not die without the conscious satisfac∣tion which a good citizen enjoys, in having carefully discharged his duty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="73" REF="79"/>
<SPEAKER>Constant.</SPEAKER>
<P>What you say, papa, appears to me quite reasonable. Then why do not all men think as you do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Com. Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Constantine, but because they have un∣fortunately been brought up in prejudices, and not had sufficient resolution to correct them? Hitherto, philoso∣phers have spoken to none but those whose understandings could not see the truth and beauty of those principles which I have happily been taught. Nor is there any hope that men, now come to years of reason and reflexion, should be taught to see them! so that those philosophers must get new pupils. In infancy the future man must be prepared. By giving him betimes a tincture of inte∣grity, beneficence and generosity, he will obtain, in his maturity, the habit of displaying them in every action of his life; and place his glory in contributing, as far as he is able, to that general revolution so much to be wished for in behalf of virtue. A young prince possessed of these exalted notions, and persuaded that the rising gene∣ration have them too, might rationally hope to govern a new sort of people, who would certainly afford a model to all other lands. Congratulate yourselves, dear children, on the circumstance of being born in those auspicious times, when children are, not only here, but universally throughout all Europe, the peculiar objects whose feli∣city philosophers are studying to promote; and not they only, but even women—women, notwithstanding narrow∣mindedness delights at all times to disparage, as it does, their understanding. Perhaps for you, and your contem∣poraries, is reserved the happiness of seeing the last traces of injustice and barbarity effaced among mankind. Thrice happy I, myself, if giving now these first ideas of a system of morality, so simple but sublime, I take but one step forward in the business of establishing this system in your hearts. You will do all that you can to second my endeavours, by communicating my instruction to your future children.</P>

<P>You imagine then, that such twists and monkey tricks are worth the native grace of childhood! it is plain, you do not know to what they tend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Euphrasia.</SPEAKER>
<P>To what, pray? Tell me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Stepney.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why to nothing less, Euphrasia, than to make you give into the habit of an odious affectation, and be as hypocritical in heart as in carriage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Euphrasia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bless me! is that true, mama? I am very glad then, that I was drawn into this conversation on the subject; as without it, I should certainly have run the risque of falling into such a vice, without intending it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Stepney.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I, Euphrasia, full of confidence in your ingenuous candor, should probably not have per∣ceived
<PB N="76" REF="82"/>it, till the malady had made so great a progress, as to render difficult the application of a proper remedy. You see, then, of what consequence it is to pay no man∣ner of attention to the instruction which children, hardly more experienced than yourself, may give; but rather to consult <HI>me</HI> always, when you want advice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Euphrasia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, mama; I promise you, I will, since you will give me good instruction. How should I feel hereafter, were you to charge me with this vice of affectation, as you know you have done with respect to other faults, in company? They have always been trifling faults; and yet, to be reproved in public for them shamed me: but for affectation—Oh, I verily believe, to be accused of that would kill me with confusion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Stepney.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have sometimes been obliged to take this method of public accusation, that the lesson I de∣signed you, might impress itself more deeply; but-be∣lieve me, we may strike a plan out that will save you, for the time to come, all such humiliation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Euphrasia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, mama, how good you are! I shall be glad to have it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Stepney.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then the plan is, to obey me at the slightest nod that I give, when any thing is to be done, or left undone. You will do well to think within your∣self, and find out, if you can, the reason of my prohibi∣tion or command; but if you cannot find it out, be obedient neverthelesess, and the first time that we are alone, come then and ask me. I shall very willingly ex∣plain my reason.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Euphrasia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, mama, your plan is indeed a very cle∣ver one; and I shall save myself a deal of care by following it.</P>
<P>Persuaded of the wisdom of this plan, Euphrasia never ventured for the future upon any the least doubtful action without first consulting her mama. She came at last to understand the slightest token from her, and could tell what was proper for her to do, in circumstances of embar∣rassment. The tender admonition of the mother, and her own reflexions, gradu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y gave her an experience far above her age; and all who knew her were as much surprized as captivated with the prudence of her conduct and the ripeness of her understanding. At the age of
<PB N="77" REF="83"/>twelve she was possessed of all the happiness to be enjoyed on earth, the inward satisfaction of her own approving heart, the attachment of her friends, and the affection of her parents.</P>

<HEAD>THE PRUDENT OFFICER.</HEAD>
<P>COLONEL Ormsby, who by his merit had attained to that high rank, observed with great concern that the officers belonging to his regiment gave their time and faculties entirely up to play. Intent upon their reformation, he invited them one day to dine with him; and having brought the conversation round to such a point that gaming might be naturally introduced, he gave them the subjoined short narrative of his own life.</P>
<P>I was no sooner come from college, than my parents bought me an Ensigney, then vacant in the regiment which I have now the honour to command. The love that I had contracted in my infancy for study, made them hope to see me equally desirous of discharging the duties of my new condition, and of attaining the reputation at which in the confidence of their hope they destined me one day to arrive. For some few months, I acted so as not to disappoint their expectations; but soon after, the pernicious model set before me by my brother officers, together with their persuasions, having drawn me in to make one with them at their meetings, the insatiate demon <HI>Play</HI> obtained such strong possession of my heart, that every duty which hindered me from gratifying this new passion, soon became int<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lerable. I could hardly bring myself to quit the gaming table for an hour, however I might stand in need of rest. In sleep, I dreamed of heaps of good and silver. I was always shuffling cards, and a continual noise of dice was in my ear.</P>
<P>The natural necessity of eating was become my punish∣ment: I swallowed up my meat in haste, that I might be as little absent from my gambling partners as I could.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="84"/>The beauteous mornings of the spring, the charming evenings of the summer, the voluptuous calmness of Au∣tumnal weather, every thing in short, most capable of pleasing the imagination when it contemplates nature, was to me entirely lost; even friendship had no further place within me. I was only in the company of gamesters. The idea of my parents was grown painful to me; and if ever I reflected upon God, it was in blasphemies poured out against his ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y name.</P>
<P>At first, I must acknowledge, fortune was particularly favourable to me; which had so bewildered and debased my understanding, as to make me often spread my winnings on the ground and lie upon them, that all those who knew me might assert with truth, and in the litteral sense of the expression, that I was used to roll on gold.</P>
<P>For three whole years my life passed on in these un∣worthy occupations. It is impossible for me, at present, to remember them without blushing at the stain which they have reflected on my honour: and if possible, I would efface them now, by giving up a half of the remaining days that I have to live. But how shall I presume to mention an excess more frightful still, of which no worthy conduct will remove the blot, even after twenty years all passed in probity and honour? Judge, my friends, how anxious I must be to render my deplorable example useful to you, by the pain which I am content to suffer, when I thus submit to so humilia∣ting a confession.</P>
<P>I was once upon a time commanded to go out with a recruiting party; but, alas! resigned the business of it to my serjeant, while I followed my unhappy passion. Two days afterwards he brought me twenty men to have their bounty money paid them. I had lost the night before, not only every thing that I possessed in the world myself, but likewise the whole sum delivered me for this re∣cruiting service. Think then, gentlemen, what must have been my sorrow and despair in such a situation! I dispatched that moment an express to where our regi∣ment lay in quarters; and ingenuously confessing my misconduct, begged a brother officer to lend me what I wanted.</P>
<P>How! replied that officer, give up so great a sum of money to a professed gambler? No; if I must either lose
<PB N="79" REF="85"/>my property, or give up my connection with a man whose conduct makes his friendship infamous, I chuse to keep my property.</P>
<P>Immediately on reading this insulting answer, I was utterly beside myself; and still remember, as what hap∣pened yesterday, the dreadful images which all at once came crowding into my imagination: on the one hand, the distress and indignation of my father, the dishonour that I was fixing on my family, as well as on every one that knew me, and the dread of being broke with in∣famy; on the other hand, the briliant prospect of that promotion which I might have obtained, by an honour∣able conduct in my post: nor did I afterwards recover the possession of my understanding, but to think of perpetra∣ting a new crime, that I might be delivered from that ignominy which my first would bring upon me. I was ready to go through with such a desperate resolution, when I saw the very officer come into my apartment, whose reply had hurried me, as I have said just now, into this state of madness.</P>
<P>In the first emotion of my rage, I fell upon him like a fiend; but he disarmed me very quickly; and while I but little thought of what was to ensue, embraced me, and began as follows. "I replied a little harshly to your letter, as I meant, by such an answer, that you should see the horror of that situation into which your rashness has pecipitated you; and I perceive what effect it has up∣on you. Now therefore that you repent, my property, my life, and every thing that I have, you may command, as you think proper."</P>
<P>"Here," continued he, and threw his purse upon the table, "here is what will serve to pay your new recruits: and the remainder may supply you at the gaming-table, if you mean to return thither."</P>
<P>Return to the gaming-table! Never, never, answered I; and clasped him to my heart.</P>
<P>Since which, I have precisely kept my word. From that day forward I determined to have done with all expen∣sive pleasures, and apply my savings to the purpose of re∣paying what my generous friend had lent me. I employed my leisure time in study. My attention to the service recommended me to my superiors; and to such a happy
<PB N="80" REF="86"/>lution in the course of my affairs I am indebted for the honour of my present station in the army.</P>
<P>This recital made so powerful an impression on his officers, that every game of hazard ceased among them, and a noble emulation to arrive at useful knowledge quenched that low ambition of winning money which was their ruling passion before. Such was the good conse∣quence resulting from their prudent colonel's lesson.</P>

<HEAD>THE PRODIGAL DOUBLY PUNISHED.</HEAD>
<P>A Worthy private gentleman, observing with concern his only son upon the point of taking to a spend∣thrift way of living, let him do as he thought proper; and it was not long before the son had run himself behind hand to a great amount. I will pay whatever debt you may contract, said the father to him, as my honour is much dearer to me than my money; but take notice of what follows: You love joyous living, and I love the poor. I have given away in charity a great deal less than I was used to do before I thought of your establishment. I will think no longer of it; a libertine should never marry; so indulge yourself as much as you think proper, but on this condition: I declare, that when, at any time, you spend beyond the money which I allow you to keep yourself as a gentleman, some hospital, or other charitable institution, shall receive from me as much as you require to satisfy your debts; and I will begin this very day. Accordingly the money was that moment ordered to a certain charity; and thus the youth, on being doubly punished for his pro∣digality, was quickly cured of a disease which otherwise would have insured his ruin.</P>

<SPEAKER>Albert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! what are they?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Yesterday they got me to go with them to a place where one <HI>Crib</HI> waited for them. We sat down to play, and I lost all I had.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Albert.</SPEAKER>
<P>They cheated you, no doubt. But still there is no great mischief done; for never play again, and then your loss will be a gain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jonathan.</SPEAKER>
<P>But this is not the whole. As I had no more money, and still wanted to win back my loss, I still played on, and in the end they got possession of my watch, my coat and waistcoat buttons, buckles, and, in short, of every thing that I had worth selling. I owe Crib a guinea likewise, and he will tell my father, if I cannot find means to pay him to-day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>There is but one thing that you can do. Con∣fess the whole directly to your father. I am sure, he will pardon you on your repentance.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jonathan.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not know how it is; but they inform me that they have certain ways by which they are sure of winning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Albert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ways! They are knavish tricks, and would you use them? I am not rich, and yet I would not mend my fortune by your certain ways. I am even sorry that you have told me your intention.</P>

<P>My dear Albert, have compassion on me, and I promise—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Albert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Promise! What can bring me to assist in your deception?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jonathan.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; I mean to say, that if I am but so lucky as to pay this odious Crib, I will break off all connexion with him and his friends; and never touch a card again. If I should break this promise, you shall be at liberty to tell my father every thing. <STAGE>(<HI>Albert shakes his head.</HI>)</STAGE> Yes, every thing. And then, it will not rest with me to cheat: I cannot if I would, and Crib has taken that upon him∣self.

<P>I do not know what to do in this affair! Poor Jonathan is afflicted! I should like to extricate him; but then to let the worthy Augustine be cheated! No, the accomplice is not better than the robber; and to favour roguery is just as bad as doing it. I will go therefore and tell the whole. But, softly! here comes Honoria. Let me first of all do every thing in my power to assist her in pre∣serving Augustine from the danger, and yet not betray my friend.</P>

<P>What, you here, Mr. Albert, and alone? I thought I saw my brother talking with you.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Albert.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has just now left me.</P>
</SP>

<P>I should wish him never to leave you, if his company were but agreeable to you: I should not be uneasy then.</P>

<P>You do me honour, miss; but surely Mr. Augustine is too sensible to give you any pain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honoria.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have no pain while he keeps company with such as you: but shall I come directly to the point? I do not think any good of those companions of Jonathan's; and he wants by all means to mix with them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Albert.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not yet perceived that their company has hurt him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honoria.</SPEAKER>
<P>True; but my poor brother, I must say, is innocent, and somewhat credulous: he judges every one to be like himself. What would become of him, if those whom he thinks his friends were what they should not be? I have remarked, that you do not much approve of Jona∣than's intimates.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Albert.</SPEAKER>
<P>To say the truth, my dear young lady, I should rather wish that Jonathan would be satisfied with Augus∣tine's friendship. There is one advantage, notwithstand∣ing, that his father watches over him, as yours does over Augustine, and instructs him what to do.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Honoria.</SPEAKER>
<P>The mischief often is remarked too late; it is easier to prevent than cure it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Albert.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure, you love your brother tenderly, and therefore hear me; but tell nobody that I mentioned what I am going now to say. Young Jonathan has pre∣vailed upon him, just before you entered, to make one with him and his three intimates. They mean to play, no doubt; but do your utmost to divert your brother from partaking with them. I designed to wait here for his an∣swer, but do not think it proper that I should carry it. I make no doubt but he will bring it presently. Pray do not judge amiss of me that I retire; and think of the ad∣vice which my duty, as a friend to Augustine, bade me give you.</P>

<P>You had something then of consequence to tell him.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augustine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, Jonathan is greatly to be pitied, being so unfortunate as not to have a place in your

<P>Do you mean to joke?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honoria.</SPEAKER>
<P>No: I am very serious, I assure you; and consider you a very amiable young man without a fault, unless indeed it be the want of due politeness to your sister.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augustine.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why so? because that sister is a little critic, and pretends to greater understanding than her brother.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Honoria.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, I had quite forgot to mention modesty, when I was drawing up your panegyric.</P>

<P>But what means this prating? and pray tell me, why these intimations with regard to Jonathan! Do you know him?</P>

<P>I would know him by his actions.</P>

<P>Are you always with him, to remark them?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honoria.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can guess them from the company that he keeps.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augustine.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand you perfectly: his company dis∣pleases you, because I am one of his acquaintance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honoria.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surely, brother, he must have acquaintances of longer standing than yourself; and I speak of them as I would of good for nothing fellows.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augustine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good for nothing fellows?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honoria.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, that play, and practise each dishonour∣able trick to win their adversary's money, and then spend it more dishonourably still.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augustine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! what two great crimes! they play when they are together; and they spend their winnings as they please. We do the same, I fancy. And besides, you say, they play to win; but they have often lost to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honoria.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes; they have lost their copper, and have won your silver.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augustine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and if they have, the loss was mine, not yours. But this is just like what my sister is. She would be sorry if she could not vex me in my pleasures, notwithstanding I do every thing to heighten hers.</P>

<P>That of being visited on your return by your acquaintance, I suppose you mean? But certainly your friends must cherish you, when we who are restrained by your authority, rejoice as much as they can do.</P>

<P>Yes, truly; for without you we can find no pleasure.</P>

<P>O sir, would you afflict us at a time when we thought of nothing but rejoicing?</P>

<P>Yes, sir, you will live, and long we hope, for our advantage. But let us talk no more on such a gloomy subject.—I have a little favour to request.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Fletcher.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, come, let us hear it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augustine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Master Jonathan—you are acquainted with his father—Well, he has invited me to spend the evening with him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>You have a new acquaintance then. I am glad that you pick up such good company so near you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honoria.</SPEAKER>
<P>You hear that? good company!</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I think him so; I have already sat down with him several times, and he has introduced me also to some friends of his.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honoria.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good company, too, I suppose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augustine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, for sure I must know them better than you.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Fletcher.</SPEAKER>
<P>When I used the words <HI>good company,</HI> I meant discreet and well bred.</P>
</SP>

<PB N="91" REF="97"/>
<SPEAKER>Augustine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, sir, extremely so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honoria.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how are you to know that they are such, as you have only seen them once or twice?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augustine.</SPEAKER>
<P>But have I not been hours together with them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fletcher.</SPEAKER>
<P>How did your acquaintance begin?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honoria.</SPEAKER>
<P>At play.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augustine.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why not so? My father lets me play.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fletcher.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, for recreation, and for such a sum as being gained will not induce the immoderate love of money, or if lost, not put one out of temper; and this likewise at a time when nothing can be done more pro∣fitable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honoria.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I thought, sir, something might be always done more profitable?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augustine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, (I speak of myself, for instance,) if I could but nail my thoughts continually to some book or other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fletcher.</SPEAKER>
<P>Honoria's remark is not amiss. One may employ a leisure evening better than at play, no doubt, if people would be always rational, or even inno∣cently mirthful; but as scandal sometimes will go round, or folly; in such case, you know, I bid you play, and often take a part myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honoria.</SPEAKER>
<P>And these I doubt not, brother, are the reasons why you play?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augustine.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not see any right that you have to cate∣chize me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fletcher.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why take offence at what she says through friendship?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augustine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rather, sir, from a desire to hurt me in your thoughts.</P>

<P>O sir, how good you are!</P>

<PB N="92" REF="98"/>
<SPEAKER>Augustine.</SPEAKER>
<P>You lay by all a father's rights, and are our friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fletcher.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I were any other than your friend, I should not be compleatly qualified to bring you up. I might perhaps connive at your neglecting outward cere∣monies of respect; but not your failure in that confidence which I expect from your affection. You should not have a secret that you would keep hid from me, as whenever you may chance to be in danger, my experience may pre∣serve you from it. Let me therefore ask you, Honoria, what are the objections that you have formed against your brother's new acquaintances?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honoria.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are always taken up with cards.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augustine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who told you so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honoria.</SPEAKER>
<P>No matter from whom I have my information: the thing is, whether it be true?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fletcher.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have already told you what I think of playing: every thing depends upon the game that you play.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augustine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! it needs no great attention: it is the game of <HI>one and thirty.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fletcher.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess, I do not approve it much.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augustine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not? There can be nothing in the world so innocent. Whoever is one and thirty, or the nearest to it, wins.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fletcher.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do you know that it is what we call a game of chance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augustine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because one has a chance to win or lose? and must not this be said of every game?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fletcher.</SPEAKER>
<P>With this material difference, that at <HI>one and thirty,</HI> chance alone decides; whereas, in many others, skill is to be shown. In short, one wants but fingers, and no head for games of chance: and in my thought, such games are utterly unworthy of a thinking man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honoria.</SPEAKER>
<P>They cannot even amuse one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augustine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not say so, dear sister. There is a deal of pleasure in expecting such or such a card as one may want.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fletcher.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because the love of money makes it so. And as this love of money operates very powerfully, it is a strong temptation for ten thousand rogues to follow gaming as a trade; and therefore unsuspecting people ge∣nerally are their dupes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="93" REF="99"/>
<SPEAKER>Augustine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you believe so, sir? but how?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honoria.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fancy, they must have some art or other, to arrange the pack in such a way, as to obtain what cards they want.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fletcher.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, that is in reality their secret. I can∣not tell their method; but am certain, that they do em∣ploy some method, and have seen deplorable examples of it in my travels.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augustine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! pray tell us what examples?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fletcher.</SPEAKER>
<P>With a deal of pleasure. When at Spa, I was acquainted with a young gentleman, who lost one night above twelve thousand pounds, which was his all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honoria.</SPEAKER>
<P>His all! poor youth! and what did he do to live?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augustine.</SPEAKER>
<P>He must have been beside himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fletcher.</SPEAKER>
<P>Despair obtained possession of his features, when he saw his fortune thus irretrievably lost. He looked so frightful, that I was forced to turn away my sight; he gnashed his teeth, plucked up his hair by handfuls, and beat violently on his breast: he gasped and panted like a dying man, and left the room quite mad.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augustine.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, sir, among those who won his money, was there no one who would give it back, as I should certainly have done?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fletcher.</SPEAKER>
<P>They kept their seats; and still continued playing on: or if they turned off their attention from the cards, it was to look upon him with contempt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honoria.</SPEAKER>
<P>The wicked wretches!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fletcher.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the worst part of the story is as fol∣lows: That this poor young man destroyed himself before the morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honoria.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! how shocking!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augustine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dreadful! and from henceforth, sir, I will never touch a card, I promise you. I'll run and tell this Jonathan.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fletcher.</SPEAKER>
<P>Softly, softly: you are always much too hasty in your resolutions. One should never wholly give a pleasure up, because, when carried to excess, it may be hurtful. I have often told you, that a game at cards, when friends are met together, is amusing, innocent, and even useful.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honoria.</SPEAKER>
<P>Useful, sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="94" REF="100"/>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fletcher.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, useful; as it teaches us to bear our fortune; and not to triumph when we win, or be dejected at our little losses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augustine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heaven be praised, I am not so fond of money as to hurt another by my insults in good fortune; or to shew that I am hurt myself, by being vexed when I am un∣lucky; but to shun what possibly might happen, it will be better for me not to visit either Jonathan or his friends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fletcher.</SPEAKER>
<P>You would only prove your weakness, if this should be your final resolution: for at least you have it in your power, when with them, to refrain from playing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Augustine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, I know them: they would absolutely make me play.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fletcher.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, play as much as they would have you, since by that means you will gain a better knowledge of them. But instead of going to this Jonathan, or his friends, invite them hither. You may also tell them that Honoria perhaps will make one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honoria.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, sir—</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>You see, <STAGE>(<HI>shewing the cards,</HI>)</STAGE> the ten and court cards are a very little longer than the rest, and all the smaller ones, as high as five, not reckoning in the aces, somewhat broader; by which means I can at pleasure bring the picture cards, &amp;c. to the top in shuffling, and the five, and those below it, to the bottom. I contrive to give you two of those on the top; and afterward, the other from the bottom: so that at the most you have but five and twenty, and will therefore generally beg.

<HEAD>THE MONKEY.</HEAD>
<P>FRANCIS, and his play-mate Lorenzo, were at the window. As it chanced, they heard a pipe and ta∣bor. Looking up the street, they saw a bear approaching sternly, and a man conducting him by a chain to which the creature was fastened at the other end. I should be afraid, said Lozenzo, to stand too near that animal; for do but listen, Francis: Did you ever hear such growling? I should quake if I were by him. Oh, he could not hurt you, answered Francis; you may see, he has a muzzle to prevent his biting.</P>
<P>They were talking thus, when Bruin was come exactly opposite their window, in his progress down the street. Two monkies now took up the little gentlemen's atten∣tion. One was light and nimble, but the other not so active. Both were jumping to and fro on Bruin's back, who suffered them to play their tricks as if he did not care about it. They had fruit in plenty thrown them by the mob, which they caught in their paws as soon as it was flung to them, and swallowed almost instantly. But what delighted them particularly, were the nuts which the peo∣ple threw them. Seated on their breech, and holding them between their two fore-paws, they broke the shells, and picked the kernels out with something of an air.</P>
<P>It chanced that a very large one came among the rest. The heavy monkey raised himself upon his long hind-legs to get it; but the little one darting forward, seized it in the air before it could have time to reach him. Cheated of his prey in this manner by the little one, he gnashed his teeth with rage. His front grew wrinkled, and his eyes flashed fire: he thrust his claws out, fell upon the little one, and seemed upon the point of tearing him to bits. The bear found it very difficult to save him.</P>
<P>Do you see, said Francis to his little friend, how fright∣ful that same monkey is become since first he fell into a rage, and how he shews his teeth? Oh no, I should not like to be within his reach! How terrible! I should be scared to death!</P>
<P>Indeed? said Lorenzo. Well then, can you imagine it; but yesterday, when you were in a passion, you were like
<PB N="107" REF="113"/>him. Look ye, you had all his wrinkles; you even grinned as he does now; your eyes shewed what a passion you were in, and like the monkey, you seemed ready to devour poor little Harry, who had notwithstanding done you no great harm. I only wished that I could have got a looking-glass. Your face was in reality so ugly, it would have frightened you.</P>
<P>Indeed! said Francis. Is it possible that I resembled such an odious beast? I could not but have been extremely frightful if I did, and must endeavour for the future to be never in a passion. When I find myself growing angry, I will then bethink me of the monkey, recollect the ma∣lice in his countenance, and that will make me shudder at the thought of being like him. Do you too, my good friend Lorenzo, if I forget this resolution, like a friend remind me of it.</P>
<P>Lorenzo assured him that he would do so, and was faithful to his promise. Francis by degrees got rid en∣tirely of his wrathful habit, or was very rarely in a pas∣sion. He enjoyed the greater happiness, and his indulgent parents were not less transported at his reformation.</P>

<HEAD>THE ALPS.</HEAD>
<P>THE sun was rising in the heavens. The dew drops which are seen on every leaf so early in the morning, glittered with the colours of the rainbow; and the shadows of the trees were shortening on the ground, when Damon, holding his son, a grown-up lad, by the hand, came out, and sat down on his garden terrace, to enjoy the freshness of the morning.</P>
<P>Dearest father, said the son, pray wake me always at this hour; for I am charmed with contemplating such a scene as I now see all round me! How delightful the whole prospect! But perhaps it would be more so, were it not confined by younder mountains, which lift up their snowy tops so high that any one would suppose them to prop the clouds above them.</P>
<P>I do not think as you do, said the father. Those same mountains leave us space enough, and <HI>that</HI> made up of
<PB N="108" REF="114"/>fields and meadows, to contemplate; and by thus consin∣ing, as you say, the prospect, help to vary it; and more particularly so at evening, when the sun still tips them with a thousand streaks of gold, even after the whole level plain is dark.</P>
<P>When we shall once have visited those mountains, and considered its inhabitants, you will be pleased with con∣templating on them, I am certain, since they cannot but suggest agreeable sensations.</P>
<P>How can men, said the youth, be fond of living on such mountains, covered as they are with snow?</P>
<P>They do not live there, said Damon; you will seek in vain to find inhabitants upon the heights: it is at the bot∣tom of the mountains that they are situated. There are charming vallies stretched among them; but before the traveller can obtain them, he discerns no prospect save that of barren rocks. This prospect being passed, he comes to wide extended carpets of the greenest sod; he breathes an air embalmed on all sides by ten thousand odoriferous flowers that grow there; and his ear is pleasingly affected by the murmurs of as many streams descending from the summit of the hills. The sun, by shining on them with his noon day radiance, makes them put on the appearance of the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ightest silver. And amongst them, some, preci∣pitated from a rock, re-echo when they reach the bottom, and <HI>there</HI> rise in clouds, as one may say, of dust, that yield a trembling kind of light. Their passage is distin∣guished by a multitude of charming flowers which blossom on the margin; and the flowers, whose stalks wave to and fro, obedient to the breeze that agitates them, and the waters that flow in among them, heighten the delightful prospect.</P>
<P>Spring is very late, and harvest very early, in this re∣gion; whence it happens that the ground brings forth no other sort of grain than what is sowed some little while before the summer, and grows ripe betimes in autumn: hence, too, it comes that the fields are shaded by no other trees than those producing cherries, plums, and other early fruit. Here and there the traveller meets with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ets; and the houses being made of wood, are so much blackened by the sun, as to afford a very striking contrast with the smiling verdure of the little orchards that surround them.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="115"/>In those hamlets live many innocent and happy families, which for the space of five or six long months are almost buried under snow. As long as that sad season lasts, they take the greatest care imaginable of their little flocks; at times they visit one another, spin the flax which they have gathered before hand, and make different articles of furniture in wood, which they either use themselves, or are sure to fell for money to their neighbours.</P>
<P>As soon towards summer as the sun has melted that vast heap of snow which covered all their fields and habi∣tations, and the river that flows through their vallies has completely carried off the water with which their lands were overflowed, all the men begin to cultivate their fields or meadows, and the women labour in their gardens. During summer, the industrious father of his family re∣pairs to other districts with the produce of his labours, and brings back, in barter for them, those conveniencies of life which are not to be had for money even in his hamlet.</P>
<P>Many travel upon mules, and cross their craggy hills along such paths as have been cut through rocks, and those, too, over frightful precipices. They transport to very distant parts the honey which they have stored in autumn, which is universally acknowledged to be excel∣lent. They likewise traffic in the skins of goats, which they entrap while climbing up the rocks, or find among them dead. Another article of merchandize for which they are distinguished, is the dormouse. This animal, benumbed by the excessive cold, retains in holes and cavi∣ties, which she digs for herself to serve by way of habita∣tion, and in which she lies rolled up almost like a ball and on a bed of hay, that heat and life which, with returning spring, the sun expands; and a fourth great object of their commerce is the crystal, which they contrive to quarry in the gaps or chasms of their highest rocks. And many, on the other hand, are guides to foreigners who have the curiosity to travel over, and inspect their frozen moun∣tains.</P>
<P>I myself have been upon them, like many others, guided in my way by one of those good men.—I call them good, in opposition to the multitudes that live in towns and civilized society.—But yet they have lost a great deal of their natural simplicity by frequent converse with such
<PB N="110" REF="116"/>foreigners as have employed them for guides. I admired the people, and their way of living; therefore, having satisfied my curiosity upon the mountains, I determined to remain among them some few days, that I might gain a better knowledge of their manners.</P>
<P>I must let you know what conversation I heard pass be∣tween the wife and child of <HI>my</HI> conductor while I lived among them. I was sitting on the grass, beneath a pine∣tree: Julian, my conductor, had that day set out before the dawn, to guide two English gentlemen who came on the preceding evening to inspect the mountains. It was still broad day-light, but the sun was rapidly descending towards the west. The mother ascended upon a rising ground; the son came after her. They fixed their eyes upon the icy masses which advanced their cloggy cliffs on the other side of the valley, and the wife began as fol∣lows:</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am looking to no purpose. I discover nothing. I do not see him yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us go to yonder rock before us, shaded by those trees, and we shall see much better thence. There we shall be able to discern more plainly all that quarter of the mountain where my father, I suppose, must be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, we are now got to it; notwithstand∣ing which, I can distinguish nothing more than from the spot that we have left. It is all lost labour: he does not appear. And yet the sun is nearly setting, and the day will soon close in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! mother, we shall yet have two full hours of day-light.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>And perhaps he may be four or five leagues distant. Who can tell exactly where he is? I wish he would give over wandering thus among the mountains. Never does he set out on his journies, but I tremble lest unfortunately he should not return alive: or else come back with broken limbs by falling down upon the ice, or while he scales the rocks.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I need not tell you that he has promised to drive this trade no longer, when the profits which he has made shall be enough to buy the little field between our cottage and the <HI>Arva.</HI>—We shall then live comfortably, with our flock, our honey, fruits, and field of barley.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="111" REF="117"/>
<SPEAKER>The Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! dear son, I should much rather wish to live in less abundance, so that I might only have more peace of mind. The happy days which we are to have when he has obtained this field, will have been bought too dearly, at the price of that distress and trouble which these his journies cost. But do not I see him? No, not yet. If he should be obliged to stay all night upon the ice!— If it—but you have got, I see, that spying-glass which a traveller lately left behind him in our hut, and that brings objects fifty furlongs off as near as if they were but ten. Look therefore if there is nothing to be seen. You know the use of it extremely well; but I, for my part, not at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will rest the end of it on this old trunk. I think, I see—yes, mother—something, and it moves.— It is he, I verily believe!—Yes, yes, it is he indeed!— He is walking on the broken flakes of ice that lie near yon big rock, and which last month, you know, were separated from it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me have the spying-glass. Quick! quick! perhaps, too, I may see him.—I must shut one eye, you say?—I have;—but I distinguish nothing. Every thing is black.—Stay, stay. O now I see the rock!—and likewise men! and Julian is among them! But I have lost them now: they are out of sight: I cannot recover them again. Hold you the glass; I shall perhaps discern them with my naked eye.—Yes, yes, I see them. They are coming on, and in the middle of the valley. Julian, I can see, comes first.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>They stop: my father sticks his pole into the ice before him, and prepares to take a spring. There, there! he is up, and down again. No doubt but there was one of those large gaps before him in the ice, of which he has so often told us. What can cause them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not know exactly; but have heard that when the ice below is melted, <HI>that</HI> above it, having no support, gives way, and opens with a noise which one may hear a great way off. You have observed the great round table in our curate's kitchen? Well, the leg which supported it in the middle was much higher than the others, and one day the sides had many heavy things laid on them. Unexpectedly it split exactly in the middle, and the crack grew wider, till the sides could rest upon
<PB N="112" REF="118"/>the shorter legs. And now I suppose these gaps are so occa∣sioned likewise. But look once again, and see what they are doing. They seem standing still. The gap sure does not prevent them from advancing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can see their countenances very plainly. They seem asking one another what they ought to do. Ah! now my father takes a second spring; and now he is got safe over one more gap.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes; I see him too. What rashness! He might slip in springing, or when over; or he might not possibly spring far enough, and drop into the gap. He does not take a single step but what he knows, as well as I do, makes my heart sink within me. He should think that it is not impossible but I may see him; he should argue within himself, and say, My wife <HI>does</HI> see me, and my danger frights her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is very far, perhaps, from guessing what we are about now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>He knows that, while he is absent on this dangerous business, I send forth my eyes to seek him. Would to heaven I could but shut them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, let us do so, mother. Let us put our hands before them, and not look again till he has cleared the valley, and is safe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot. I had rather tremble every mo∣ment for his safety, than lose sight of him, though for a moment only. But where is he? I can see him now no longer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor I either.—They have disappeared. Ah, mother!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>My poor child! embrace me. We are now left to ourselves, and I have nothing in the world to com∣fort me but you. Yes, they have disappeared indeed; and in a moment too! I did but turn away my eyes to fix them upon you, and in that instant they are vanished! An abyss perhaps has opened under them as they were going on: perhaps they may be tossing in it, not yet dead, but making unavailing efforts to get out, and calling for assistance with a voice which no one, to their cost, is nigh enough to hear. I will hasten to the spot: come, follow me, my child! My knees knock one against another, and will hardly bear my body up; but I shall soon find strength sufficient to go forward. Come; but stay a little!
<PB N="113" REF="119"/>—Do not you, dear child, see something there in mo∣tion? There, just where I point to; at the bottom of you rock?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes; I think I do.—It is one of them. —It is one of them, indeed; and now I can discern the other. I can see his hat; but still I look in vain to find out my poor father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>He will come, and I dare hope to see him very soon. The gentlemen must first have got out of the frozen valley, and they hide him from us. Doubtless it will not be long before we see him. Look again, my child.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can see only the two gentlemen; my father is not with them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>And the gentlemen, do they seem waiting for him then? Have they their faces turned towards the place from which they come?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; they walk strait forward.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then so much the better. If your father were not following them, or could not, they would hardly do so: they would try whatever they were able to assist him in his danger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes; we should do as much; but they, on the other hand, seem rich; and I have often heard that such despise the poor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not all; and then, too, they are men, and must be sensible of people's misery like others. Would not you stretch forth a hand to help your little dog, were he in danger? Would you leave him unassisited?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>No indeed: but why? because I love him: and do rich men love the poor? I have had money given me by one rich man to fight my play-mate.—Ah! I think I see my father now; yes, there he is! yes, yes, indeed; and, as you said, behind the gentlemen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes; I see him too. Thank God! But still my heart beats grievously. I am in a tremble: So let us both sit down; we will have our eyes fixed on them till they are safe on this side of the valley; and by that time, as I hope, my agitation will be calmed. Me∣thinks they come on very quick. No doubt they wish to end their journey before day shuts in. Look, son: I fancy they are drawing nigh a precipice before them; and my fears again came on me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="114" REF="120"/>
<SPEAKER>The Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a mass of ice that forms a hollow under∣neath. It looks as if it were suspended in the air, and they do not seem to know their danger; for they stop.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>They stop! and may, perhaps, without expecting it, be swallowed up, or buried in the ruins, should the ice fall down! It will fall down, and I shall see—oh heavens! fly for your life, my Julian! my dear Julian! fly! see what a mass of ice may overwhelm you! Fly!—My voice, alas! at such a distance, is not to be heard. My cries are useless. I am distracted!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mother, I can see no longer through the spying-glass, because I cry; and yet I cannot take away my eyes. But now I see again. Yes, there they are, and they have cleared the precipice, quite cleared it. They are out of danger now: I see them: they turn back to view the rock under which they have passed, perhaps, without knowing at the time what peril they encountered. They lift their arms up; they are talking to each other; they are looking at some object that astounds them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are out of danger; that is enough for me. I see them: they have nothing now but level ground remaining. Kiss me, my dear child! and let us both pass on to meet your father. But at no time in my life shall I forget what I have felt this afternoon. Let us make all possible haste, and beg that he would no more thus venture into danger. We shall have the little field, in that case, somewhat later; or it may be not at all; and it is no matter. We have lived till now without it: our enjoyments have not been on that account the less; we have in short been happy, and what more can we desire? I shall not for the future know that he is returning to those frozen regions, without fearing every danger that I know, and such as I can but guess. He may, perhaps, be safe feated at his ease beneath a tree; but I shall fancy that I behold him struggling in a gap, and striving to get out. Whatever money he receives from those whom he may conduct,—if he but loves us, he should think that he buys it at a price too dear.</P>
</SP>
<P>The mother and the son upon this went forward, and I followed them till they had gained the valley. They pressed on to meet a husband, and a father; and at last, when they observed him with the Englishmen draw near, they durst not note him. They sat down together, let
<PB N="115" REF="121"/>him pass, and then got up and followed slowly after. It was not before they reached their cottage, that the wife and son ran both to Julian, and together sunk into his arms. The son related every thing which they had both seen and feared. The mother did not speak at first; but when she saw her husband touched by the affectionate behaviour of his son, she once again embraced him and shed tears. He promised that he would never more af∣fright her by returning to the ice, but cultivate his field in peace.</P>

<P>COME, said Mr. Glassington to Percival his son, one beauteous summer morning, here is a basket with some cake and currants in it. Let us go and break∣fast by the river's side.</P>
<P>With all my heart, papa, said Percival, and jumped about for joy. He took the basket in one hand, and with the other in his father's, hastened towards the river.

Then how spacious! it covers every hill, and all the level plain. The lambs repose upon it at their ease. Think, Percival, what they would have to suffer, on a bare or stony piece of ground! Their limbs are so extremely delicate, they could not but be very quickly injured. They have mothers, but those mothers cannot make them up soft feather-beds.

<HEAD>THE THREE CAKES.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glassington.</SPEAKER>
<P>THERE was a little boy named Henry, about your age. His pa∣rents had but lately fixed him at a boarding-school. He was a special boy, for ever at his book, and happened once to get the highest place at exercises. His mama was told it. She could no how keep from dreaming of the pleasure; and when morning came, she got up early, sent to speak with the cook, and said as follows: Cook, you are to make a cake for Henry, who yesterday was very
<PB N="117" REF="123"/>good at school. With all my heart, replied the cook, and set immediately about it. It was as big as—let me see,—as big as—as a hat when flapped. The cook had stuffed it with nice almonds, large Pistachio nuts, and candied lemon-peel, and iced it over with a coat of sugar, so that it was very smooth, and of a perfect white. The cake no sooner was come home from baking, than the cook put on her things, and carried it to school. When Henry first saw it, he jumped up and down like any Merry An∣drew. He was not so patient as to wait 'till they could let him have a knife, but fell upon it tooth and nail.— He ate and ate 'till school began, and after school was over he ate again: at night too it was the same thing 'till bed-time. Nay, a little fellow that Henry had for a play∣mate, told me that he put the cake upon his bolster when he went to bed, and waked and waked a dozen times, that he might take a bit. I cannot so easily believe this last particular; but then it is very true, at least, that on the morrow, when the day was hardly broke, he set about his favourite business once again, continuing at it all the morn∣ing, and by noon had ate it up. The dinner bell now rung, but Henry, as one may fancy, had no stomach, and was vexed to see how heartily the other children ate. It was, however, worse than this at five o'clock, when school was over. His companions asked him if he would not play at cricket, taw, or kites. Alas! he could not; so they played without him. In the mean time Henry could hardly stand upon his legs; he went and sat down in a corner very gloomy, while the children said one to another, What is the matter with poor Henry, who used to skip about, and be so merry? See how pale and sor∣rowful he is! The master came himself, and seeing him, was quite alarmed. It was all lost labour to interrogate him. Henry could not be brought to speak a single word. By great good luck, a boy at length came forward in the secret; and his information was, that Henry's mama had sent him a great cake the day before, which he had swal∣lowed in an instant as it were, and that his present sick∣ness was occasioned only by his gluttony. On this, the master sent for an apothecary, who soon ordered him a quantity of physic, phial after phial. Henry, as one would fancy, found it very nauseous, but was forced to take the whole for fear of dying; which, had he omitted
<PB N="118" REF="124"/>it, would certainly have been the case. When some few days of physic and strict regimen had passed, his health was re-established as before; but his mama protested that she would never let him have another cake.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Percival.</SPEAKER>
<P>He did not merit so much as the smell of such a thing. But this is but one cake, papa; and you in∣formed me that there were three, if you remember, in your story.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glassington.</SPEAKER>
<P>Patience! patience! here is another cake in what I am now going to tell.</P>
<P>Henry's master had another scholar whose name was Francis. He had written his mama a very pretty letter, and it had not so much as a blotted stroke; in recompence for which she sent him likewise a great cake, and Francis thus addressed himself: I will not, like that glutton Henry, eat up my cake at once, and so be fick as he was: no, I will make my pleasure last a great deal longer. So he took the cake, which he could hardly lift by reason of its weight, and watched the opportunity of slipping up into his chamber with it, where his box was, and in which he put it under lock and key. At play-time every day he slipped away from his companions, went up stairs a tip-toe, cut a tolerable slice off, swallowed it, put by the rest, and then came down and mixed again with his com∣panions. He continued this clandestine business all the week; and even then the cake was hardly half consumed. But what ensued? At last the cake grew dry, and quickly after mouldy; nay, the very maggots got into it, and by that means had their share; on which account it was not then worth eating, and our young curmudgeon was com∣pelled to fling the rest away with great reluctance. How∣ever, no one grieved for him.</P>

<P>No indeed; nor I, papa. What, keep a cake locked up seven days together, and not give one's friend a bit! That is monstrous! But let us have the other now.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glassington.</SPEAKER>
<P>There was another little gentleman who went to school with Henry and Francis likewise, and his name was Gratian. His mama sent <HI>him</HI> a cake one day, because she loved him, and indeed he loved her also very much. It was no sooner come, than Gratian thus addressed his young companions: Come and look at what mama has sent me; you must every one eat with me.
<PB N="119" REF="125"/>They scarce needed such a welcome piece of information twice, but all got round the cake, as you have doubtless seen the bees resorting to a flower just blow. As Gra∣tian was provided with a knife, he cut a great piece off, and then divided it into as many shares as he had brought boys together by such a courteous invitation. Upon this he ranged them in a circle, and beginning with the boy who then stood next him, he went round, distributing to each his portion, 'till the shares were all disposed of in this manner. Gratian then took up the rest, and told them that he would eat his piece next day; on which he put it up, and went to play with his companions who were all solicitous to have him chuse whatever game he thought might entertain him most.</P>
<P>A quarter of an hour had scarcely past as they were playing, when a poor old man, who had a fiddle, came into the yard. He had a very long white beard, and being blind, was guided by a little dog who went before him with a collar round his neck. To this a cord was fastened, which the poor blind man held in his hand. It was noticed with how much dexterity the little dog con∣ducted him, and how he shook a bell which, I forgot to say, hung underneath his collar, when he came near any one, as if he had designed to say by such an action, Do not throw down or run against my master. Being come into the yard, he sat him down upon a stone, and hearing several children talking round him, May dear little gen∣tlemen, said he, I will play you all the pretty tunes that I know, if you will give me leave. The children wished for nothing half so much. He put his violin in tune, and then thrummed over several jigs, and other scraps of music, which it was easy to conjecture had been new in former times. Little Gratian saw that while he played his merriest airs, a tear would now and then roll down his cheeks, on which he stooped to ask him why he wept? Because, said the musician, I am very hungry. I have no one in the world that will give my dog or me a bit of any thing to eat. I wish I could but work, and get for both of us a morsel of something, but I have lost my strength and sight. Alas! I laboured hard till I was old, and now I want bread. The generous Gratian hearing this, wept too. He did not say a word; but ran to fetch the cake which he had designed to eat himself. He
<PB N="120" REF="126"/>brought it out with joy, and as he ran along, began. Here, good old man, here is some cake for you. Where? replied the poor musician, feeling with his hands; where is it! for I am blind, and cannot see you. Gratian put the cake into his hand, when laying down his fiddle on the ground, he wiped his eyes, and then began to eat. At every piece he put into his mouth, he gave his faithful little dog a bit, who came and ate out of his hand; and Gratian, standing by him, smiled with plea∣sure at the thought of having fed the poor old man when he was hungry.</P>

So I will cut it smooth.—There—See how well I have ordered it!—These scraps, together with the currants, will be more than I shall want for breakfast: and the first poor man that I meet going home, shall have the rest, even though he should not play upon the violin.</P>

<HEAD>THE SUN AND MOON.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT a charming evening! Come, Alexis, said Mr. Wilmot to his little boy; the sun is just ready to go down. How glorious he appears! We may behold him now. He does not dazzle us so much at present as he did at noon, when he was up so very high. How beautiful, too, the clouds seem round about him! They are of a purple, gold and scarlet colour! But behold how swiftly he descends! Already only half his orb is visible. And now he is wholly vanished. Rarewell sun; you have left us for the present till to-morrow morning.</P>
<P>Look, Alexis, towards that quarter of the heavens just opposite to where the sun descended. What may that be shining so behind the trees? a fire? No, nothing like it, but the moon. How large and red it is! One would sup∣pose it full of blood! This evening it is quite round, on as they say, full moon. It will not be quite so round to∣morrow evening; less so the next evening; less the even∣ing after; and so on, decreasing something every evening, till at last it will be in some sort like a wire bent round into a semicircle, when a fortnight is gone.</P>
<P>It will then be new moon, and from day to day you will observe it afterward grow bigger, and seem rounder, till in fourteen days more it will be again full moon, and rise as it does now behind the trees.</P>
<P>But pray, papa, inform me, how do both the sun and moon preserve their situations unsupported in the air? I always fear they cannot but fall down upon my head.</P>
<P>Fear nothing, dear Alexis: there is no danger. I will explain the reason why, when you can understand the matter; so at present only listen while I mention how the sun and moon address you.</P>
<P>To begin then with the sun: He says as follows: I am King of day. I rise, or make my first appearance in the East; and what they call Aurora, or the dawn, precedes me, that mankind may know of my approach. I tap soon after at your window with a golden beam of light, to warn you of my presence. Rise, I say, rise lazy-boots.
<PB N="124" REF="130"/>I never shine, that men may lie a bed and snore. I shine that they may wake, get up, aad go to work.</P>
<P>I am the mighty traveller; and I run rejoicing like a giant, quite across the heavens, without ever stopping; for at no time am I weary.</P>
<P>I have a crown of glorious radiance on my head. I shed this radiance round about me to a vast extent, and even over half the universe. Wherever I am present, all things are beautiful and bright.</P>
<P>I give heat too, as well as light. It is I who ripen with my beams the fruit in gardens, and the corn that grows in fields. If I should cease a moment to assist the course of nature, nothing then could grow, and famished men would die of despair, in all the horrors of that darkness which you yourself dread so much.</P>
<P>I am higher than the hills and clouds. I should but need to come down a little towards the earth, and my de∣vouring flame would burn it up as soon as you have seen the straw consumed which men toss in bundles into a furnace.</P>
<P>What a length of time has passed since first I gladdened the whole universe! Alexis, you were hardly in the world six years ago, but I was. I was in it when your dear papa was born, and many thousand years before; and I am not grown old yet.</P>
<P>At times I lay aside my crown of radiance, and sur∣round my head with silver clouds. It is not so difficult to view me then; but when I dissipate those clouds about me, and burst forth in all my noon-day splendor, you could never bear the blaze: should you attempt to bear it, I should blind you. There is but one living creature that can look at me, and that living creature is the eagle, whom the birds confess their monarch. He can contem∣plate my glory with a steady eye wide open, while he views me.</P>
<P>This same eagle, darting from the summit of some ele∣vated mountain, shapes his progress towards me with a towering wing, and soon is lost amid my beams, through which he darts to pay me homage every minute of the day. The lark, suspended in the air a great deal lower, sings, while I am rising, his best song, and wakes the other bird, that slumber in ten thousand trees. The cork,
<PB N="125" REF="131"/>remaining on the ground, proclaims the time of my return to mortals with a piercing voice. But, on the other hand, the bat and owl avoid my presence: they fly from me with a plaintive cry, and hasten to take refuge in the ruins of those towers which I once saw proudly rising, do∣mineering afterward for many ages over spacious countries, and then finking with the burthen of old age.</P>
<P>My empire is not limited, like that of earthly monarchs, to a corner of the world. The universe at large is my dominion; and besides, I am the most illustrious object that was ever gazed at.</P>
<P>But the moon says, in the next place, with a voice not half so much exalted as the sun's, I am the queen of night. I send my silver beams to give you light, as often as the sun withdraws at evening from the world.</P>
<P>You may keep looking at me without danger; for I am never so resplendent as to dazzle the spectator, much less do I burn. I am so good natured that I let poor glow∣worms blaze among the hedges, which the sun, unpitying as he is, will not.</P>
<P>The stars shine round about me; but I myself am far more luminous than any star: nay, all the stars together give not so much light as I do: and I seem among their multitude as if I were a fair round pearl, surrounded by ten thousand little diamonds.</P>
<P>When you lie asleep, I dart a beam of silver brightness through your curtains; and my words are, Sleep on, lit∣tle friend, in safety. You are tired. I will not disturb your slumber.</P>
<P>You have heard the nightingale. <HI>She</HI> sings for me, who sings much better than all other birds. She perches on a spray, and fills the forest with her music, no less sweet and gentle than my brightness, while the dew de∣scends on every flower, and all is calm and silent in my empire.</P>

<HEAD>THE ROSE-BUSH.</HEAD>
<P>WHO will give me some nice tree or other for my garden? said little Frederic one day to his bro∣thers Augustus and Jasper, and his sister Jemima.</P>
<P>(Their papa had given them each a little bit of ground to sew or plant, as they thought proper.)</P>
<P>Oh not I, said Augustus; not I, said Jasper.</P>
<P>Well then, I will, answered Jemima. Let me know what fort of trees you would like?</P>
<P>A rose-bush, cried Frederic. Do but look at mine: it is the only one now left me; and the leaves, as you may see, are turned quite yellow.</P>
<P>Come then, said the lively Jemima, come and chuse one for yourself. On which she led him to a little spot of ground that she cultivated; and the moment they had en∣tered, pointing with her finger to a charming rose-bush, told him he had nothing else to do, than take it up im∣mediately.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frederic.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, sister! you have only two, and wish be∣sides to give me up the finest! No, no; here is the least, and just such as I want.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jemima.</SPEAKER>
<P>You do not know how much pleasure I shall feel, if you will but take the other, Frederic. This may scarce produce you any flowers next summer; but the other will, I am certain: and you know, I shall be pleased as much with looking at it elsewhere, when full blown, as if it had continued in my garden.</P>
<P>Frederic overjoyed, approached the rose-bush, took it up; and Jemima, much more pleased, assisted in the transplantation.</P>
<P>It appears that the gardener noticed this surprising piece of kindness in the little girl. Away he ran, selected from a number of young Windsor pear-trees, one which he thought the finest, and immediately conveyed it into Je∣mima's garden, planting it exactly in the spot which the rose-bush had possessed before.</P>
<P>Those who have a churlish nature hardly ever are assi∣duous: therefore when the summer months were come, Jasper and his brother having never attended their rose
<PB N="127" REF="133"/>plants, they promised no great quantity of flowers; and to increase their disappointment, the chief part of those which they thought were coming, perished in the bud; while on the contrary Frederic's rose-bush, in consequence of great attention paid it by himself and Jemima, bore the finest centfoil roses that the whole county could boast; and as long as it remained in flower, the happy Frederic always had a rose to stick in Jemima's bosom, and another for himself to smell.</P>
<P>Likewise did the Windsor pear-tree thrive surprisingly: it scattered a delicious perfume over all the garden, and soon grew so thick and lofty as to yield a tolerable um∣brage. Jemima used to come and take her seat beneath it, when the sun was hottest; as her father also did, when he would tell her charming stories, some of which would make her all at once burst out a laughing till her sides even ached again; and others produced such agreeable melancholy in her, that soon after she would smile with pleasure at the recollection of her sorrow.</P>
<P>Here is one that he told her for her generosity towards Frederic; by which story she was thoroughly convinced that such as we oblige can recompence our generosity; which circumstance, he said, without adverting to the sa∣tisfaction of our hearts, must be a strong incentive to kind actions.</P>

<HEAD>THE NOSEGAYS.</HEAD>
<P>LITTLE Gerald went out one morning with his neighbour Eugene, to divert themselves by gather∣ing flowers. Their eagerness would not allow them to dispatch their breakfast in the house: they took it with them in their hands.</P>
<P>They met a beggar-woman in the way, who had a child apparently expiring, as it were, with hunger.</P>
<P>My dear little master, said the woman, looking upon Gerald, who happened to be first, for heaven's sake give my child a morsel of your bread. He has not had a bit of any thing to eat since yesterday.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="134"/>It may be so, said Gerald; but I am very hungry like∣wise, and went forward, munching all the way.</P>
<P>Now what was Eugene's conduct? He was no less hun∣gry, we must think, than his companion; but beholding how the poor child cried, he gave up his bread and but∣ter; and received a hundred blessings which God heard in heaven.</P>
<P>But this is not the whole. The little boy, revived by what the charitable Eugene had bestowed upon him, in∣stantly began to run before his benefactor, brought him to a meadow, where he knew there was a multitude of flowers, and helped to make up so magnificent a bow-pot, that the pleasant smell proceeding from it made him quite forget his trouble.</P>
<P>Eugene, after this, went home and shewed it with a deal of pleasure; for not only was the sweetness of it very grateful, but its size was such that he might easily have hid his face behind it.</P>
<P>Next day likewise they went out, and then another little boy, whose name was Watty, met them.</P>
<P>After having taken half a dozen turns with Gerald and Eugene in the meadow, Watty, looking down, perceived his buckle lost, and begged them both to assist him in searching for it. Oh, says Gerald, I cannot spare time enough for that at present, and went on; but Eugene stopped immediately, that he might be of service to his little friend.</P>
<P>He walked a long while up and down, both stooping all the way, and patting with his hand, to try if he could feel it in the grass: and had at last the happiness to find it.</P>
<P>Watty too was happy; and they set about the business which had brought them thither.</P>
<P>Watty, out of gratitude, bestowed the finest flowers of those which he had gathered, upon Eugene; but paid no regard to Gerald, who had refused to help him; so that Eugene had that day also, a finer bow-pot than Gerald, and came back as satisfied as he was discontented.</P>
<P>Gerald supposed the third day he might prove more lucky: He preceded Eugene, and defied him to collect a finer bow-pot than he should. But hardly were they come into the meadow, when behold the little boy who had
<PB N="129" REF="135"/>been fed by Eugene, came to meet him with a basket full of flowers which, it seems, he had gathered that morning.</P>
<P>Gerald would have begun to gather for himself; but how was he to find the flowers? The little boy had got up earlier by a deal than he; and therefore he had still less flowers that day than either of the two preceding.</P>
<P>They were going home, but met little Watty.</P>
<P>My dear friend, said he to Eugene, I have not forgot the service that you did me yesterday, and have taken such a liking to you, that I could wish to be at all times in your company. Papa too, though he never saw you, has the same ideas in your favour, and has bid me come and fetch you to his house this morning: He designs to tell us merry stories, and afterwards will play with us.</P>
<P>I will take you to a garden here hard by us, where we are allowed to walk, and there you will find four or five companions of my age to welcome you; when we are all together we will play at whatever game you like.</P>
<P>Eugene instantly laid hold of Watty's hand, and flew like lightning with him towards the garden. As for Ge∣rald, poor fellow! he went home quite melancholy. Watty had not once invited him.</P>
<P>He learned by these three days adventures, but parti∣cularly by the last, how much one gains by kindness and assistance granted to others. He reformed his churlish temper; and would certainly, in time, have shown him∣self as courteous to the full as Eugene, if this last, by having exercised a friendly disposition from his cradle, had not conferred his favours with a greater grace.</P>

<P>Nor yet, mama, is this the whole; for every day I will take a walk out with my brother, that the lamb may use itself to follow him, as well as me. The little creature in this manner will be quite familiar with my brother, when I give him away; and my brother will love him the better.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Maddison.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come my dearest, and embrace me. Be assured, this delicate attention will encrease the value of your present. Thus the merest trifle may become a valuable object, when bestowed with such a grace. You could not give your brother, or even me, such joy with any other present.</P>
<P>Nor myself, mama, replied Viola, with vivacity.</P>
<P>You will be happier still, continued Mrs. Maddison, when once the birth-day comes; because, as I must con∣tribute something, I intend that you shall perform the honours, for me, of a little cold collation to be served up in the garden, for your brother, and such friends as he may wish to have invited.</P>
<P>Hearing this, the little lady kissed her mother's hand with ardour, and immediately ran off to make up half a dozen artificial roses, with a crimson ribbon which she had by her. And with those roses she intended to dress out the lamb on her brother's birth-day, when she made him so affectionate a present.</P>

<HEAD>THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER.</HEAD>
<P>A Silly servant maid had possessed the imagination of her master's children with a hundred foolish tales of spirits, and particularly of a black-faced goblin, as she called it.</P>
<P>Antonia, one of these poor children, for the first time in her life, beheld a chimney-sweeper knocking at her father's door. She made a lamentable outcry, and betook herself for refuge to the first apartment that she found open, which apartment was the kitchen.</P>
<P>Hardly had she hid herself behind a table, when the black-faced man came in, as if, in her imagination, he had meant to follow her.</P>
<P>This frightened her a second time; and up she ran into a pantry, higher than the kitchen floor by half a dozen steps, and not a great way from the fire place: where she thought she should be safe from danger, in a corner.</P>
<P>She had hardly come, however, to herself, when sud∣denly she heard the frightful fellow singing in the chim∣ney; and, with brush and scraper, making all the while a rattling noise against the bricks about him.</P>
<P>Being seized with terror, she jumped up, and leaping through a window, which was rather low, into the garden, ran quite breathless towards an arbour at the bottom of it, where she fell half dead, and almost void of motion, close beside a tree.</P>
<P>Though she had changed her situation by so great a distance, yet hardly did she venture to look about her; when by chance she saw the black-faced man appear again, and wave his brush about him, at the chimney-top.</P>
<P>On this, Antonia almost split her throat with crying out, Help! help!</P>
<P>Her father heard the cry, and running towards the arbour, asked what ailed her, that she cried out so! An∣tonia had not strength sufficient to articulate a single word, and therefore, keeping silence, pointed to the place where Grim was then sitting astride, and flourishing his brush.</P>
<P>Her father smiled; and to convince her what small cause she had for terror, waited till the chimney-sweeper
<PB N="133" REF="139"/>was come down. He then bade him be called, and cleaned a little in Antonia's presence; after which, with∣out explaining matters any further, he sent up into the house to fetch his barber, who, it happened, was then waiting for him, and who consequently had his face all over white with powder.</P>
<P>She was heartily ashamed of having feared so much, without occasion; and her father took this opportunity of giving her to understand, that there were whole nations, in a certain quarter of the globe, all over black by nature, but not therefore to be dreaded by white children; since these last were, in another country, generally nursed by women purchased of those nations, without losing any of their whiteness.</P>
<P>Ever afterwards, Antonia was the first to laugh at silly stories, told by silly people, of hobgoblins and the like, to fright her.</P>

<HEAD>THE CHERRIES.</HEAD>
<P>JOHANNA and Felix one day got permission, from their dear mama, to take a turn or two about the garden, by themselves: they had deserved this confidence placed in them, by their past discretion.</P>
<P>They amused themselves, by playing for a time toge∣ther, with that decent gaiety by which it is easy to dis∣tinguish young children who have been well brought up.</P>
<P>Against the garden wall grew many fruit-trees, and among them a young cherry-tree, which had no earlier than the year before been grafted, and was now in fruit. Its fruit indeed was very little; but on that account, per∣haps much the finer.</P>
<P>Mrs. Dutton, their mother, did not want to gather them, though ripe. She kept them for her husband's eat∣ing, who that very day was to return from York where business had a long time kept him.</P>
<P>As the children were accustomed to obedience, and for∣bidden once for all to gather any kind of fruit, or pick up even such as they might find upon the ground, to eat
<PB N="134" REF="140"/>it, without asking leave, she thought it useless to say any thing about this cherry-tree.</P>
<P>When Johanna and Felix were fatigued with running up and down the terrace, Come, said Felix, let us do something else now; upon which they joined their hands, and walked sedately towards the bottom of the garden, casting every now and then a look of appetite upon the fruit with which the espaliers were loaded.</P>
<P>They were soon come up to this late grafted tree. A little blast of wind had shook the finest cherries from it, and they lay upon the ground close by. Young Felix was the first to see them. He advanced his foot, stooped down, and picked them up, ate some, and gave Johanna some, who are them likewise.</P>
<P>They had not yet flung the stones away, when as it chanced, Johanna recollected her mama's command to eat no fruit but what she might think fit to give her.</P>
<P>Ah! said she to Felix, we have disobeyed mama by eat∣ing any of these cherries, and shall make her angry with us, when she comes to know it. What had we best do?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Felix.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why need mama know any thing about it? We may hold our tongues.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Johanna.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; she needs must know it, brother. She frequently forgives us the greatest faults that we can commit, when we confess them of ourselves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Felix.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes; but in this instance we have disobeyed her, and she never yet forgave us disobedience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Johanna.</SPEAKER>
<P>When she punishes our faults, I need not tell you, brother, it is because she loves us; and in conse∣quence of being punished, we are not so very likely to forget, as otherwise we should, what we may do, and what we may not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Felix.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, but she is always sorry when she punishes our faults, and being sorry, she is unhappy: so I should not like to see mama unhappy, which would be the case did she but know what we have done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Johanna.</SPEAKER>
<P>Neither should I wish to see my mama unhap∣py; but would she not be much more so, upon discovering that we had wished to bide our faults? Should we be bold enough to look her in the sate while we were secretly re∣proached by our own hearts? or rather, should we not be quite ashamed to hear her call us her dear children, know∣ing as we must, how little we deserve it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="135" REF="141"/>
<SPEAKER>Felix.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, my dearest sister! you have quite convinced me; and indeed we should, in that case, be two little monsters: therefore let us go to her, and acknowledge what we have done.</P>
<P>They kissed each other, and went hand in hand to their mama's apartment.</P>
<P>Dear mama, began Johanna, we have disobeyed you, and not remembered what you forbade us. Punish me and Felix as we merit, but pray do not be angry with us; we should both be quite uneasy were our fault to make you sorry or unhappy.</P>
<P>She related, in the next place, what her brother and her∣self had done, without endeavouring to excuse the action.</P>
<P>Mrs. Dutton was so affected with the openness of Felix and Johanna, that a tear of tenderness and love escaped her. She could not resolve on punishing their fault, but generously overlooked it. She well knew that children of a happy disposition are more powerfully wrought on by the recollection of a mother's kindness, than by that of her severity.</P>

<HEAD>THE LITTLE PRATER.</HEAD>
<P>LEONORA was endued with spirit and vivacity. When scarcely six years old, she was exceedingly well practised in the art of managing her needle, and could very cleverly employ her scissars. All the garters that her papa and brothers wore were of her making. She could read with ease in any book that she happened to take up; her writing was also extremely neat and fair. She did not huddle great and little letters in one word to∣gether, neither did they lean some this and others that way; and her lines went strait along, not dancing up and down from one side of her paper to the other, as I have too often seen in many children's writing-books, even older by a year or two than Leonora.</P>
<P>Her papa too, and mama, were no less satisfied with her obedience, than her masters with her diligence and study. She kept up a perfect union with her sisters, treated every servant with the greatest affability, and her companions with regard and condescension. All her parents' friends,
<PB N="136" REF="142"/>and every stranger that came there a visiting, were equally enchanted with her company and conversation.</P>
<P>Who would think, that with so many recommendatory qualities, and so much understanding, any little girl could possibly be so unfortunate that none, when they grew ac∣quainted at the house, could bear her? Such was Leonora, notwithstanding; for a single fault which she had unhap∣pily contracted, was so great as to destroy the effect of all her juvenile accomplishments. The intemperance of her tongue made every one forget the graces of her under∣standing, and the goodness of her heart. In short, our Leonora was the greatest prater living.</P>
<P>When, for instance, she was sitting down to work, one might have heard her say, Oho! I fancy, it is high time that I should be doing something! What would my mama say, should she find me sitting with my arms across, a lol∣ling on my elbows?—O my stars! how much I have got to hem here? all this apron! But at worst, I never let the grass grow under me when I set out, and I shall soon have done. Ah! there the clock strikes: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine—Yes, positively nine o'clock! Well then, I have but two poor hours before I go to music; yet a deal of business may be done in such a length of time. Mamma, when she observes how diligent I have been, will be sure to give me sweetmeats.—Oh! what pleasure I shall have in looking at them! Nothing do I love like nice crisped almonds. Not that I do not like egg plumbs preserved: they are very good too, for papa popped one into my mouth last Thursday, and then gave me a whole bagfull; but I think crisped almonds better.—I should like to see Miss Dolly this morning: I would shew her the fine petticoat that mama has bought me. Dolly is a funny little girl enough! I like her vastly. Oh! but she loves talking, and I do not know how it happens, but one cannot thrust a word in when her clap∣per is set a going. Where has my thimble hid itself? Sister, have you seen my thimble? Patty must have surely lost it for me, when she came to sweep the parlour.—It is so like her! she is always such a hairbrained creature! Who can work without a thimble? at least I never take a stitch, if I mislay it; for the needle pricks one's finger, and one's finger bleeds of course; and then, besides the pain it gives one, how one's work looks when it is spotted
<PB N="137" REF="143"/>with red marks! Why, Patty! Patty! where can you be! Have you seen my thimble? Oh, no! here it is; and, just as if the matter were contrived on purpose, at the bot∣tom of my work-bag.</P>
<P>Thus the little creature would be always dinning peo∣ple's ears who happened to be near her. When her pa∣rents were engaged in any interesting conversation with each other, she would come and mix in their discourse, by prating upon twenty different subjects. And at din∣ner, she had hardly ever ended with her meat, before the pie or pudding was on the table. She would really forget to eat and drink, while everlastingly employed in prating.</P>
<P>Her papa would frequently reprove her twenty times a day for this defect; but all reproof was lost upon her, neither would the greatest punishment produce a reforma∣tion in her conduct. As it was not possible for any one to hear himself when she was by, Miss Chatterbox was often sent to pass the morning all alone in her apartment. Du∣ring dinner, they would put her at a little table by her∣self, as distant from the company as they could place her. Leonora seemed afflicted at this separation, but was not a whit the more silent on that account. She had always some subject of discourse, were it even addressed only to her∣self, and, nevertheless, she talked so loud every word that she said was heard; for, it was the same to her if any bo∣dy was or was not by her: and I verily believe, that, ra∣ther than be mute, she would have entered into conversa∣tion with her knife and fork.</P>
<P>From such a foolish habit, what advantage did she ob∣tain? The story tells us, only punishment and hatred. If you should not be convinced of this by what I have al∣ready mentioned, you will certainly be so when you read what follows:</P>
<P>Once upon a time, her parents were invited to go down into the country for a week or fortnight, by a friend. It was in autumn, the weather was extremely fine, and it is not easy to conceive what great abundance there was then of every kind of fruit, pears, apples, nectarines and peaches.</P>
<P>Leonora thought it was designed to make her of the party, but stood very much surprised when her papa, di∣recting both her sisters to get ready for the journey, told
<PB N="138" REF="144"/>her that she must stay at home. She fell a crying, ran to her mama, and said, My dear mama, what fault have I committed, that papa should be so angry with me?— Your papa, she answered, is not angry with you; but believe me it is impossible for any one to bear your constant chatter. You would certainly interrupt our pleasure, and the pleasure of the family that we are now going to visit; and therefore for the future, when∣ever we go abroad, we must always leave you behind us.</P>
<P>Must I never speak, then? answered Leonora.</P>
<P>That, said her mama, would be no less a fault than what we wish to see you cured of. You are not to be entirely mute; but then you ought to wait 'till you perceive that your turn for speaking is come round, and not incessantly prevent your parents, and as many as have more experience than yourself, from talking. You should also take care how you say whatever comes into your head. When you desire to be informed of any thing which it is not improper you should know, you ought to ask in as few words as possible, and having any thing to tell, you should, in that case, first of all reflect within yourself, if those about you would or would not like to hear it.</P>
<P>Leonora, thought she could not reasonably call in ques∣tion this advice, would not have wanted words to justify her prating, if she had not heard that moment her papa call out that every thing was ready; and, in fact, the coach was off that very instant.</P>
<P>Leonora fell a sighing, and with tears pursued the car∣riage 'till her eye no longer could discern it. When it was wholly out of sight, she went into a corner, and be∣gan to weep most bitterly. Ah, babbling gossip! said she, <STAGE>(<HI>now speaking to herself,</HI>)</STAGE> it is all owing to my long tongue that I have been thus punished. I will take care, that for the future it shall never speak a word more than it ought.</P>
<P>Some few days afterwards they returned. Leonora's sisters brought home with them baskets full of pears and apples. They were both exceedingly well tempered; therefore Leonora would on no account have gone without her share, but then the tears that she had been shedding
<PB N="139" REF="145"/>so completely took away her appetite, that it is not to be wondered if she did not wish for any. She that moment ran to her papa, imploring his pardon for her fault in having forced him, (as she knew,) much against his will, to punish her. We have been both unhappy, added she; but for the future I shall take care, and never speak too much.</P>
<P>Her father tenderly embraced and kissed her.</P>
<P>On the morrow, Leonora was permitted to sit down and take her dinner with the rest. She spoke very little, but whatever she did say was full of grace and modesty. It is true, it cost her very much to check her tongue, which, through impatience and the itch of talking, rolled, if I may say so, this and that way in her mouth; but on the following day, this work of checking her propensity towards talking was less painful, and the next day still less so. At length the difficulty, by a gradual diminution, was completely done away. At present she has totally got rid of her bad habit, and she figures in society with credit to herself, and pleasure to her friends, who are no longer vexed with what they were accustomed to entitle, in derision, her <HI>incessant clack.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE SELF-CORRECTED LIAR.</HEAD>
<P>LITTLE Griffith was now six years old, and had never yet told a falsity. He never had committed any fault, and therefore had no need to hide the truth. When any accident befel him, as to break a pane of glass, or spot his cloaths, he went immediately and told his father, who would be always so good as to forgive him, with a caution that in future he should be more careful.</P>
<P>Griffith had a cousin, but a very naughty boy, whose name was Robert. Robert came one day to see him; and Griffith, by way of shewing his attention to his visitor, made pro∣posals for a game at drafts. His cousin eagerly accepted the proposal, on condition that they should play for some∣thing. Griffith for a little time refused, but in the end was wrought upon by Robert, and in hardly more than thirty minutes, all the money which he had been laying up
<PB N="143" REF="149"/>many weeks from his allowance was compleatly gone. Affected with his loss, poor Griffith got into a corner, and began to cry, while Robert fell a laughing, and went home in triumph with his spoil.</P>
<P>It was not long before poor Griffith's father, who had been from home, returned. He loved the child, and therefore sent to see him in the parlour. But what ails you? said he. And what has happened? Sure you have been crying?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Griffith.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, papa, because my cousin has been here, and made me play with him at drafts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what of that? I see no harm done yet; for drafts are a diversion that I have given you leave to take. But possibly you played for money?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Griffith.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! no, no, papa.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then why do you cry?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Griffith.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because I wished to show my cousin how much money I had saved to buy myself a book. Now I had hid it all behind the great stone post without, and when I put my hand into the hole, it was gone. Some person, passing by the gate, has stolen it.</P>
<P>Griffith's father, some how or another, fancied this re∣cital to be false: but did not mention his suspicions then. He went that moment to his brother's, and as soon as he saw little Robert, he forced a smile, and began in this manner:</P>
<P>Well, my child, you have been lucky, have not you, to-day?</P>
<P>Oh! yes, said Robert, very lucky, sir!</P>
<P>And what did you win?</P>
<P>A shilling, said the nephew.</P>
<P>What, so much? And did he pay you, Robert?</P>
<P>Doubtless, uncle. I have it in my pocket.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding Griffith had deserved a grievous pu∣nishment, his father thought it not amiss to pardon this, as being his first falsehood; and therefore only told him, with a scornful tone of voice, that since he knew that he had a liar in his house, he would tell all the servants never to believe him, whatsoever he should say.</P>
<P>Some few days after, Griffith went in turn to visit Robert, and pulled out a handsome pencil-case which his sister had bestowed him at Christmas. Robert wished to have it, and in exchange would have been glad to
<PB N="144" REF="150"/>give him every one of his playthings, his ball, his top, and rackets; but as Griffith, he observed, would not part with it, he began to play the bully, put his arms akimbo, and advanced towards him, said, "The pencil case is mine: I lost it at your house, or else you stole it." Griffith, to no purpose, earnestly protest∣ed that it was his sister's present. Robert quickly let him see that he meant to force it from him; and as Griffith grasped it with both hands, he closed upon him, threw him down, got over him, and with his double fist so pomelled Griffith in the face that he was forced to yield the case.</P>
<P>Poor Griffith, being treated in this manner, posted home, his nose all over blood, and half his hair pulled off — "Papa, papa, (said he, as soon as he was come within his father's hearing,) look how I have been used! The naughty Robert has this moment robbed me of my pencil-case, and handled me as you see."</P>
<P>But far from pitying him, his father answered, "Go, you liar; you have lost your pencil-case at drafts, and to deceive me, smeared your nose with mulberry juice, and put your hair into disorder." Griffith solemnly protest∣ed, to no purpose, that he spoke only the truth." I can∣not credit (said the father) one who has already proved himself a liar."</P>
<P>Griffith, quite confounded, went away into his cham∣ber, and bewailed most bitterly the consequences of his first untruth. Next day he begged permission to appear before his father, and implored forgiveness. "I acknow∣ledge (said he) how wicked I have been in seeking to deceive you with a falshood once; but, dear papa, let me entreat you to give up your resolutions of believing me no longer when I even speak the truth!</P>
<P>His father told me the other day that from that moment Griffith had not let the least untruth escape him, and that therefore he had recompenced his son's veracity by trusting him implicitly. He never looked for protestations from him: it was sufficient Griffith barely told him any thing, that he should take it for as great a certainty as if himself had seen it.</P>
<P>What a satisfaction this to be experienced by a tender father, and a son so worthy of him!</P>

<HEAD>RECEIPT TO BE ALWAYS PLEASED.</HEAD>
<P>I Should be very glad to play, mama, all day, said Laura.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Delwin.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, <HI>all</HI> day?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laura.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! yes, mama.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Delwin.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall be very glad to give you any plea∣sure in my power, my little Laura; but I fear, you will very soon be tired.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laura.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of playing! Never. You shall see that, mama.</P>
<P>And saying so, the little Laura ran to fetch her play∣things. She had got them all together, but was quite alone; for both her sisters were that day to be employed with different masters, till the afternoon.</P>
<P>At first, she played as she thought proper, and was very happy for an hour or thereabout; but, by degrees, the pleasure which she enjoyed began to lose a little of its power to please her.</P>
<P>She had now handled her play-things twenty times, or oftener, and could tell no longer what to do. Her fa∣vourite doll was grown quite troublesome and tedious to her.</P>
<P>She desired her dear mama to shew her some new me∣thod of diversion, and to play with her; but unfortunately her mama had very pressing business, and could not attend to her, however she might wish to do so.</P>
<P>Laura, after this, sat moping in a corner, till her sisters, had quite finished with their masters, and were now about to take a little recreation. She ran to them in a melan∣choly mood, which was as much as mentioning how long their time of study had seemed to her, and with what im∣patience she had wished to see them.</P>
<P>They proposed immediately such games as they sup∣posed most entertaining, for they loved her greatly: but, alas! all their solicitude was useless. Laura could not but complain that every game which they mentioned had already tired her; nay, in her impatience, she even ven∣tured to accuse them of conspiring with each other to afford her such diversion only as they knew would not amuse her. Upon which Miss Amelia, her eldest sister,
<PB N="146" REF="152"/>an extremely sensible young lady ten years old, took Laura by the hand, and with a smile began as follows:</P>
<P>Look at us, dear Laura, and I will tell you which per∣son in the room occasions your dissatisfaction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laura.</SPEAKER>
<P>And who is it, sister? For my part, I don't know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>The reason is, you do not look at yourself. Yes, Laura, you yourself occasion your dissatisfaction; for you see these games amuse <HI>us</HI> still, though we have played them over, you may easily imagine, before you were born: but then we have been both at work, and therefore are they in a manner new to us. If you, by previous study and attention, had obtained an appetite for pleasure, you would certainly have been pleased as casily as we are.</P>
<P>Little Laura, who, however young she was, by no means wanted understanding, was so struck with these remarks, as to discern that every one who would be happy should take care to mix improving exercise with pleasing recreation. And indeed, I know not whether, after such experience gained, the menace of a whole day's pleasure would not have more terrified her than that of a whole day's labour.</P>

<HEAD>THE TULIPS.</HEAD>
<P>LUCETTA had seen for two summers successively a bed of tulips in her father's garden, which were streaked with the most beautiful colours.</P>
<P>Like the fluttering butterfly, she often roved from flower to flower, being struck merely with their beauty, but never reflecting to what they owed their origin.</P>
<P>Last Autumn, she saw her father amuse himself with digging up the bed and planting tulip roots. Ah! papa, cried she in a whimpering tone, what are you doing? Will you spoil all our fine tulip bed so, and instead of those fine flowers that grew there, put nasty onions in it for the kitchen?</P>
<P>Her father answered her, that he knew what he was about, and he was going to tell her that from those onions would come forth new tulips the following year; but
<PB N="147" REF="153"/>Lucetta interrupted him by her complaints, and would listen to nothing.</P>
<P>When her father saw that he could not make her under∣stand reason, he left her to pacify herself, and continued his work while she retired sobbing.</P>
<P>During the Winter, as often as the conversation turned upon flowers, Lucetta sighed, and thought within herself how great a pity it was that her father had destroyed the finest ornament of the garden. Winter finished its course, and Spring came next to sweep the snow and ice off the ground.</P>
<P>Lucetta had not entered the garden yet. Indeed it would have been difficult to prevail on her to go in, as it was deprived of her favourite flower. One day, how∣ever, she entered without thinking. But what were her transports of surprize and joy, when she saw the tulip bed still more beautiful than the preceding year! She stood still at first, motionless and silent with admiration: at length she threw herself into her father's arms, crying, Ah! dear papa, I thank you for plucking up those nasty onions, and for putting in their place those sweet flowers that I am so fond of.</P>
<P>Yo owe me no thanks, answered her father; for these sweet flowers that you are so fond of sprung from nothing else but my nasty onions.</P>
<P>The obstinate Lucetta would not believe a word of it; upon which her father pulled up carefully one of the finest tulips, together with the bulbous root (resembling an onion) from which the stalk grew, and presented it to her.</P>
<P>Lucetta, quite confounded, asked pardon for having been so unreasonable. I pardon you, my dear child, with all my heart, replied her father, provided you ac∣knowledge how easy it is for children to deceive them∣selves, when they attempt to judge, after their ignorance, of the actions of people who have had experience.</P>
<P>Oh! yes, papa, answered Lucetta, I am convinced of that, and therefore for the future shall distrust my own eyes; and whenever I shall be tempted to suppose that I know more of the matter than other people, I will think of the Tulips and the Onions.</P>
<P>I am very glad, my dear little friends, that I had it in my power to tell you this story; for you will presently see what happened to another child who had never heard it.</P>

<HEAD>THE STRAWBERRIES AND CURRANTS.</HEAD>
<P>ALLAN had frequently heard his father say, that children were without the least degree of knowledge touching what was proper for them; and that all the wis∣dom which they could possibly prove themselves to possess, lay in following the advice of people older than themselves. And yet he never had sincerely wished to understand this doctrine, or perhaps, to speak as favourably as the matter will allow, had forgot it.</P>
<P>His indulgent father had allotted him and Prospero, his brother, a convenient piece of ground, that each might have a little garden, and display his industry and know∣ledge in the cultivation of it. And not only this, but they had leave to sow whatever seed they thought proper, or to take any tree-root already growing in their father's garden, and transplant it.</P>
<P>Prospero remembered the instruction of his father, went to have a little conversation on this subject with Ralph the gardener, and began thus: Pray tell me what I ought to sow at present in my garden, and how set about my work?</P>
<P>The gardener gave him several roots and seeds adapted to the season. Prospero that moment ran and put them in the ground, and Ralph was so kind as to assist him in the work, and to give him some instruction.</P>
<P>But Allan, seeing Prospero's docility, shrugged up his shoulders. Ralph, not observing this contemptuous action, asked if he should give him some assistance and instruction likewise?</P>
<P>Yes, replied Allan, I have great occasion, to be sure, of your assistance and instruction, particularly the last!</P>
<P>On this, he went into his father's garden; and select∣ing for his own, a quantity of flowers, transplanted them immediately. The gardener let him do as he thought fit.</P>
<P>Next morning, when Allan visited his garden, all the flowers which he had so lately planted hung their heads like mourners at a funeral, and, as he saw, were dying. He transplanted others from his father's garden, which the morning after he observed, with much vexation, were exactly in the same condition.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="155"/>He was very soon disgusted with this sort of work. It was paying very dear, we must acknowledge, for the pleasure of possessing a few flowers. Of course he gave it up, and it was not long before his piece of ground was overrun with weeds and thistles.</P>
<P>Towards the middle of the Spring, as he was looking at his brother's garden, he saw something red suspended very near the ground, which, on examination, he discerned to be strawberries, and found to have an exquisite degree of flavour.</P>
<P>Ah, said he, if I had planted strawberries in my garden!</P>
<P>Some time after, likewise, he saw certain little berries of a milk white colour, that hung down in clusters from the branches of a bush; upon examination, they were currants, which to look at only was a banquet.</P>
<P>Ah, said he again, if I had planted currants in my garden!</P>
<P>Eat as many as you like, said Prospero, as if they were your own.</P>
<P>It rested with yourself and no one else, remarked the gardener, to have had as good; so never for the future treat with scorn the assistance and instruction which any one may offer you, who is possessed of greater knowledge and experience than yourself.</P>

<HEAD>OBLIGINGNESS AND COMPLAISANCE.</HEAD>
<P>EMILIA, Victoria, Juliet, and Sophia, had a go∣verness who loved them with the fondness of a mother. This governess was called Mademoiselle Beaufoy.</P>
<P>Her greatest wish was, that her pupils should be virtuous in order to be happy; that a friendship for each other should increase the pleasures of their childhood; and that they should taste those pleasures without diminution or anxiety.</P>
<P>A kind indulgence, and exact degree of justice towards them, were the constant motives of her conduct, whether she had any thing to pardon, to reward, or punish in them.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="156"/>She enjoyed, with infinite delight, the pleasing fruits of her instruction and example.</P>
<P>The four little girls began to be the happiest children upon earth. They told each other of their faults, forgave each other, shared together of each other's joys, and could not live without each other.</P>
<P>Alas! by what fatality do children poison the source of their own enjoyments, at the very moment when they begin to taste its charms; and how great is their hap∣piness when they are placed under the eye of a person endowed with equal prudence and tenderness.</P>
<P>It happened, Mademoiselle Beaufoy was forced to leave her pupils for a time, as certain family concerns obliged her to visit France. She left them with reluctance, made a sacrifice of some advantages to the desire of quickly settling her affairs, and hardly had a month expired when she returned in safety to her little flock.</P>
<P>They all received her with the greatest signs of joy: but, alas! what an unhappy alteration did she very soon perceive in these poor little children!</P>
<P>If, as frequently it happened, any one among them asked the slightest favour of another, the latter ill-naturedly refused it, and hence followed discontent and quarrels:— the uncommon gaiety that hitherto had been remarkable in all their little sports, and made their work itself delight∣ful, was now changed to peevishness and melancholy; and instead of those expressions dictated by peace and friendship, which were before heard in all their conversa∣tions, nothing now prevailed among them but incessant bickerings. Did either wish to take an hour's diversion in the garden? her sisters were sure to assign some reason for remaining in their chamber. And, in short, it was enough that any thing should meet the wish of one among them to displease the others.</P>
<P>It particularly chanced one day, that not contented to deny each other every sort of friendship and obligingness, they mutually distressed each other with reproaches. Mademoiselle Beaufoy, who sat as a witness of this scene▪ was so affected by it as even to shed tears.</P>
<P>She could not speak a word; and pensively withdrew into her chamber, that she might the better think upon the means of rendering back to these unhappy little ones
<PB N="151" REF="157"/>the pleasures which they had lost of their former friendship and reciprocal attachment.</P>
<P>She was still employed in this afflicting task when all the four young ladies entered her apartment, with a peevish and uneasy look, complaining that they could be no longer happy in each other's company. There was not one of them but charged the rest with causing it; and all toge∣ther earnestly desired their governess to restore them, if possible, to their lost happiness.</P>
<P>The governess received them in a very serious manner▪ saying, I observe, my children, you obstruct each other in your pleasures; therefore, that this circumstance may never come to pass again, let each take up her corner in this very room, if she thinks proper, and divert herself in any way that she likes, but so as not to interfere with either of her sisters. You may have recourse to this new mode of recreation instantly, as you have leave to play till night; but each (remember) in her corner, as I said just now.</P>
<P>The little girls were charmed with this proposal, took their places, and began to play.</P>
<P>Sophia entered into conversation with her doll, or rather told her many little stories; but her doll could not reply, and had no stories in her turn to tell. It was in vain to look for any entertainment from her sisters; they were playing, each asunder, in their corners.</P>
<P>Juliet took her battledore and shuttlecock, yet none applauded her dexterity; besides, she would gladly have struck it across the room, but in that case there was no∣body to send it back. It was in vain to hope such service from her sisters; they were playing, each asunder, in their corners.</P>
<P>Emilia could have wished to pass the time that now hung heavy on her at a game of which she was very fond, <HI>hunt the slipper:</HI> but, alas! who was there to pass the slipper from hand to hand? It was in vain to ask her sisters; they were playing, each asunder, in their corners.</P>
<P>And Victoria, who was very skilful as a little house∣wife, thought how she might give her friends an enter∣tainment, and of course send out for many things to market. But who was to receive her orders? It was in vain to pitch upon her sisters; they were playing, each asunder, in their corners.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="158"/>It was just the same with every other play. All of them supposed that it would be compromising matters to ap∣proach each other, and therefore they disdainfully conti∣nued in their solitude. At length the day concluded. They returned again to Mademoiselle Beaufoy, and begged her to shew them a better sort of amusement than that which she had already recommended.</P>
<P>I can only think of one, my children, answered she, which you yourselves knew very well formerly, but which it seems you have now forgotten. Yet, if you wish to put it once more into practice, I can easily remind you of it.</P>
<P>Oh! we wish to recollect it with all our hearts, replied they; and stood all attention to seize with ardour the first word that their governess should utter.</P>
<P>It is, answered she, that reciprocal obligingness, that mutual friendship, which sisters owe to each other. O, my dearest little friends! how miserable have you con∣trived to make yourselves and me too, since you lost it!</P>
<P>She stopped short when she had uttered these few words, which yet were interrupted frequently by sighs, while tears of tenderness ran down her cheeks.</P>
<P>The little girls appeared astonished and struck dumb with sorrow and confusion in her presence. She held out her arms; they rushed at once affectionately towards her, and sincerely promised that they would love each other for the future, and agree as they had done before she left them.</P>
<P>From that moment they betrayed no signs of peevish∣ness to trouble their harmonious intercourse. Instead of bickerings and discontent amongst them, nothing now was known but mutual condescensions which delighted all who had the opportunity of being with them.</P>
<P>They preserve this amiable character at present in the world among their friends, of whom they are acknowledged to be the delight and ornament.</P>

<P>But how is that possible? you that were for∣merly so well to live!</P>

<P>You have reason to be surprized at it, knowing as you do how laborious we always were, and that we did no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> manage like one half of our neighbours, who do not know how to lay by any thing against a rainy day. However, we have had severe losses since you left us, and now the worst of it is that we are indebted to our landlord upwards of four pounds. We cannot pay it, and the steward threatens every day to turn us out of doors, in which case we must beg our bread.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Just Heavens! could I have thought to find you in so sad a situation!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moorhouse.</SPEAKER>
<P>We should never have been in it, had the steward not contrived to make you, as he did, a soldier. It was wholly a contrivance on his part, of which I will tell you the particulars some other opportunity. When he was nothing but a bailiff, and had scarce a coat to wear, I would not lend him money, and it was then that he first of all began to hate us. And at length he has compleated his revenge. Our house is to be sold, and you will not possess a groat belonging to your father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you had but something to subsist on, I should not regard myself. Here is all the money that I possess.
<PB N="161" REF="167"/>I give it you with tears, because I have no more to spare you.—</P>

<P>May heaven repay it to you a hundred fold, my dear child! This will keep us a few days.</P>

<P>He will be here this very day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I will be sure to tell him something that may do you good. The king is coming to review our re∣giment; so you shall go and tell him your sad situation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moorhouse.</SPEAKER>
<P>I go tell him! I should not be able to pro∣nounce a word before him. I should stand stock still, or perhaps run away through fear and terror, were I forced into his presence!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never fear: he would return you a kind an∣swer. I was once a centinel at Windsor, on the Ter∣race, when the king was walking there: it was upon a Sunday evening. I shall never sure forget with what fa∣miliarity he spoke to people; but that is nothing; for he met one morning with a poor man's child as he was walking through the town, and entering into conversation, found him such a clever little fellow, that he ordered him a guinea: when the father heard it, he was ever on the watch to fall in with his majesty, as he was walking out. He proved at last so fortunate as to obtain a hearing, when he thanked him for the guinea; upon which the king, would you believe it, ordered him another guinea for his gratitude, as he particularly mentioned.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moorhouse.</SPEAKER>
<P>You don't tell me so.</P>

<P>In truth I am so much better pleased; because a soldier, who would lay up such a deal of money from his slender pay, must certainly deprive himself of many little

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was what I always thought; and there∣fore never would go pillaging: indeed with all the plun∣der that others got, I found they were not richer than myself: but on the contrary, spent half their time in the black hole, being always guilty of some crime or other, after they had been a robbing, for it was nothing else; whereas my officers were never troubled with com∣plaints of me.</P>

<P>I cannot, my good sir, pay more than half; nor should I have been able to do that, if Providence had not assisted me. Be so indulgent as to wait till harvest for the rest, and do not compleat my ruin by distressing me still further than I am distressed already.</P>

<P>Suppose yourself a moment in this young man's situation. He is a soldier, and a soldier always knows what he is to say; a thousand times better, at least, than any steward. You have dared before his face, to tell his father that he shall go upon his travels. We all know the meaning of that phrase; and would you have him stand there like a post before you, without having the spirit to open his lips? Who could keep his temper if he saw his family on the point of being ruined by an ill-natured our of your stamp? We know what stewards are, and how they make fortunes.

<P>Ah! sir, does it not afflict you, when you recollect that yesterday you said so much in praise of my unworthy son?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Captain.</SPEAKER>
<P>He had deserved it; though indeed I could not have supposed my commendation would have had such bad effects. But <STAGE>(<HI>to George</HI>)</STAGE> tell me what could possibly induce you to desert! You must have had some very ungent motive. Let me know the secrets of your heart, whatever be the consequence. You have been pu∣nished, and have therefore nothing now to fear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>My worthy captain, do not, I beseech you, take away your favour from me! I will endeavour to de∣serve it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>The Captain.</HI>)</SPEAKER>
<P>If you tell the truth, I will not. For to fancy that you deserted for a quarrel, which, I understand, you had with a Steward, is absurd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="177" REF="183"/>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, your honour may be certain, there is no other reason. It is well known, I never was remark∣able for quarrelling with any one. The least offence ap∣pears enormous, when one has not been accustomed to it. I was so disturbed at the affair that it took away my reason; and besides, the unhappy situation of my father aided to distract me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Captain.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then signified these words that you said on entering the prison with the Serjeant? <HI>Thank Heaven, it is over, and my father is safe!</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moorhouse,</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(<HI>astonished.</HI>)</STAGE> Were those his words, sir? God forgive me, but the devil surely must have turned his brain.</P>

<SPEAKER>The Captain,</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(<HI>taking him by the hand.</HI>)</STAGE> Do not, my ho∣nest fellow, study to deceive us. This desertion has some other reason than your quarrel. Your dissimulation very much displeases me; and you are likely to lose all my friendship. Was it not on account of your father—</P>

<P>I see, you are not worth the trouble that I am taking for you, and no longer wish to be informed of any thing about you. You are more indifferent to me than the worst of men. You do not know, perhaps, how much you have lost by this prevarication.</P>

<P>No, you have nothing to fear; I give you my promise.</P>

<SPEAKER>Thomas.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, good sir, it was to save his parents that he deserted. He found means to make me turn in∣fermer, and get forty shillings, that his father might have wherewithal to pay his debts; but now, his father will not hear a word about the money or his son. Let me be∣seech you therefore, sir, to rid me of this money, which I cannot keep, and interpose at least with your authority and kindness, that my brother may be profited by what his son has so affectionately done to benefit him; for the affair is exactly as I relate it to you. <STAGE>(<HI>Every one appears astonished.</HI>)</STAGE></P>

<HEAD>THE BED OF DEATH.</HEAD>
<P>DUNCAN, a bricklayer's labourer, living in a distant country town, had lost his wife about a quarter of a year before the event we are to write of. The e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pences of a tedious illness, and the interruption of
<PB N="181" REF="187"/>his labour by a very rainy season, had reduced him to the last distress. His children were half naked, and had really no bread to eat. This circumstance was of itself sufficiently tormenting; but to aggravate the scene, Su∣sanna, his poor mother, laid upon a little straw in the corner of the cottage, was almost in the agonies of death.</P>
<P>Duncan, at such a prospect round about him, over∣whelmed with sorrow, took a broken matted chair, and at a little distance from Susanna's bed sat down upon it, having both his hands held up, that he might hide his tears.</P>
<P>His mother turning towards him, with a feeble voice enquired if there was no where in the house a rag to put upon her. I cannot make myself warm, said she, do what I will.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Duncan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stay, mother; I will pull off my coat, and lay it on you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Susanna.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; I will not have it, my dear son. A little straw, if you have nothing else, will do as well. But have you not a single bit of wood still left to make a sire for these poor children? You will tell me, you cannot go into the fields, because of the attention that I require. My life is very long, since I am grown burthensome to you!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Duncan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray do not say so, dear mother. Would to God I could procure you what you want, at the expence of my own life! I would freely give it up: but this is my grief, that you suffer cold and hunger, while I am utterly unable to relieve you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Susanna.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not let that, however, afflict you much, my poor son. Thank God, my agonies are not so great as your affection fears they may be: they will very quickly finish, and my blessing will be the recompence of what you are doing now, and have been always doing for me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Duncan.</SPEAKER>
<P>O my poor dear mother! In my infancy you put yourself to many difficulties for my maintenance; and I, in your old age, must thus sit by and see you want for common necessaries! That, dear mother, rends my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Susanna.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know, it is not through any fault of yours; and then, Duncan, upon a death-bed one has few—(be∣lieve me when I tell you so)—few earthly wants. Our heavenly father has us then particularly in his care. I

Soon, yes, very soon, thank heaven, you will have nothing left you but to close my eye-lids. I shall then ascend to my creator, tell what you have done for me, and earnestly beseech him to re∣ward you for it everlastingly. Think frequently of me, and I will think of you above.</P>

<P>I saw your little Arthur come yesterday here close behind my bed, and pull out several apples, which he ate. Duncan, these apples were not ours; for then he would have thrown them on the table, and asked me to take some. I remember still how lovingly he used to come and fling himself into my arms, when he had any thing to give me; saying with so much good-nature, Eat some, do, my dear grandmother. O my dear, dear son! if he should be a thief hereafter! The thought has afflicted me ever since yesterday. Where is he? Pray go fetch him. I would talk a little to him.</P>

Tell him that I, too, beg him to forgive you. Go, my good Duncan, with Arthur; inform him how it grieves me that I am not able to make him restitution for the theft: but that I will pray to God for his prosperity, and beg a blessing on his family. Alas! he is no less poor than we; and were it not that his good woman works so hard, he could never bring up such a family of children as he has. My dear good son, for my sake, when I am dead and buried, give him a day's work to make him up his loss: it matters not how little he has suffered. We should think it criminal to take away a pin.

<P>Yes, mother; so do not let the matter make you any more uneasy.</P>
<P>He had hardly said these words, when, as it chanced, 'Squire Wearthy's steward tapped without against the window.</P>
<P>Poor Susanna knew him by his usual way of tapping, and the cough he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>antly had on him. Bless me, it is the steward! said she.

<SPEAKER>Duncan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not be frightened thus, my good mother: I am not a single farthing in his debt; and for the rent that we owe the 'squire at Midsummer, I will give him all the labour that he requires in harvest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Susanna.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, provided he will but wait so long.</P>
<P>Duncan went out to know the steward's business. After he was gone, Susanna fetched a grievous sigh, and said, discoursing with herself, Since he was so hard-hearted as to seize upon our goods for rent, I cannot see or hear him, but my heart revolts at the idea; and at present, in my dying moments, he must come and cough at our window. But perhaps the hand of God brings him hither as an admonition for me to discharge my heart of every thing that looks like malice or ill-will against him, and even pray for mercy on his soul. Well then, my God, I am content to do so. I no longer wish him any harm. Forgive his sin, as I forgive it. <STAGE>(<HI>She hears the steward speaking rather loud.</HI>)</STAGE></P>
<P>But I hear his voice! he is in a passion!—Heaven take pity on us!—O my poor Duncan, it is out of love for me that you have fallen again into his hands. <STAGE>(<HI>She faints, on which the little boy jumps off the bed, and runs to fetch his father.</HI>)</STAGE></P>

<P>O father, father! Quick, come here! My grandmother is dying.</P>

<P>Luckily Duncan was got too far to hear these cruel words. He was already by Susanna's bed, who speedily recovered from her swoon, and thus addressed her son:</P>
<P>The steward came to scold you; I could hear him. Doubtless he will not grant you time, when once the quarter is turned.</P>

<SPEAKER>Duncan.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is the 'square's design, he says, to pull down and rebuild his house; at least the front and stables; and to employ me at it, with my neighbours. I shall have at least, he says, ten shillings every week.</P>

<P>God's providence be praised for all things! I shall now die happy, seeing you enabled to get bread to feed your little ones. Death now has nothing painful in it. Heaven is merciful! may you, Duncan, at all times find it so: but tell me, are you not by this convinced of what I have so often told you, that the more misfortunes on one side attack us, so much more God's grace awaits us on the other?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Duncan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I am, and shall be always. But methinks you seem much better. Let me quit you for about a mi∣nute. I will go fetch a little straw to cover you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Susanna.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; I feel myself much warmer. Rather go with Arthur to neighbour Leonard's. That is what disturbs me most of all. Go, my son, I ask it as a favour.</P>
<P>Hearing this, he did not stay a moment in the room, but took his son, and going out, gave Margaret a sign to come and let him speak with her.</P>

<P>Leonard was at work, and Gertrude his wife was left all alone at home. She saw at once that the father and the child had both been crying.</P>
<P>What is the matter with you, my good friend, said Gertrude, that you have been crying? What is the matter with you, my poor Arthur?</P>

<SPEAKER>Duncan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, neighbour Gertrude! I am quite unhappy. This poor child of mine who wanted victuals yesterday, came here and took some apples that were yours: he has confessed it. My poor mother saw him eat them.—Ger∣trude, she is on her death bed, and desires you to forgive him. I cannot pay you now the worth of what he took away; but when I go to work, which will be very shortly, I will be sure to satisfy you.</P>

<P>O don't speak about it, neighbour: it is a trifle not worth mentioning. And you, my little fellow, promise that you will never for the future take what is not your own. <STAGE>(<HI>She kisses him.</HI>)</STAGE> You are born of such good people!</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Duncan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank ye, neighbour; but I hope, he will never want bread again. I have got a deal of work to do at 'Squire Wealthy's.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Gertrude.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I heard so of the servants, and was very glad.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Duncan.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was not near so happy when I got it on my own account, as for my mother's sake. She has at least this comfort on her death-bed. Tell my good friend Leonard that I shall work with all my heart to make him compensation for his loss.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gertrude.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not speak about it, I request you once again. My husband, I am certain, will not think of any compensation. He was out of work himself, and is to have the wood work of the job for which you are engaged. But as poor Susanna is so ill, I will go and give her my assistance.</P>
<P>Gertrude got on her cloak, and then put up some pears and apples in a bag, and filled the little fellow's pockets likewise; took him by the hand, and bidding poor Dun∣can go first, came after.</P>
<P>They had quickly reached Susanna's chamber. Ger∣trude held out her hand, but turned away her face, that she might hide her tears. Susanna, notwithstanding, saw her, and began as follows:</P>
<P>You are crying then, my dear friend Gertrude?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gertrude.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed I cry to see you suffer thus.</P>
</SP>

<P>But if when older, he should take to be a thief!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gertrude.</SPEAKER>
<P>No. no: I will answer for him, he will be good. My dear Susanna, you deserve this recompense of heaven for your own honesty, and all the care that you have taken to bring up your family in virtue. Do you want for any thing? Do not fear to tell me if you do: for every thing that we have is at your service.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arthur.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, indeed; for only see what Gertrude has given me! <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, dear grandmother, do, eat some.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Susanna.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my child, I cannot: I shall never eat again; I feel my strength go from me, and I have almost lost my sight. My son, draw near me: now is come the moment to take leave, and give you my farewell.</P>
<P>Duncan no sooner heard these words, than he was seized all over with a sudden trembling: he took off his hat, fell down upon his knees beside Susanna's bed, laid hold with ardour of her hand, then lifted up his eyes to heaven, and would fain have spoke, but could not: tears and sighs prevented him.</P>
<P>Take comfort, said Susanna; I am going to a happier life than this, and there will wait your coming. When we once meet there, we shall not part again.</P>
<P>Duncan in some degree recovering, bowed his head, and craved his mother's blessing. Bless me, said he, my dear mother. I desire to follow you, when once my chil∣dren have no further need of my assistance.</P>
<P>Susanna opened once again her dying eyes; and with uncommon fervour looking up, pronounced these words:</P>
<P>Hear me, O heavenly father, and vouchsafe the bles∣sings of thy grace and favour to my son, the only one that I ever had, and whose affection was the comfort of my life. Duncan, may God be always with you, and confirm in heaven this blessing which I pronounce on you for having fulfilled your duty so much like a son.</P>
<P>Hear me now, my dear Duncan, and carefully observe what I shall tell you. Bring your children up in virtue, and accustom them betimes to a laborious life, that if they should be poor, they may not, when grown up, lose courage, and be tempted to do wrong. Instruct them to place all their trust in God, and to live good friends with one another; so that they may find sure consolation in the
<PB N="189" REF="195"/>evils of this life. Forgive the steward his injustice. When I am buried, pray inform him that I departed without any malice or ill-will against him, and besought of God that he would grant him of his grace to see the sin that he had committed, and repent before he came upon a death-bed. <STAGE>(<HI>She stops a little to take breath, and then goes on.</HI>)</STAGE></P>
<P>Reach me, my good friend, <STAGE>(<HI>to Gertrude</HI>)</STAGE> that book be∣hind you; and my dear Duncan, there is a little leather bag in our great chest; I wish to have it. Good! <STAGE>(<HI>she takes and clasps them to her heart.</HI>)</STAGE> These are the only treasures that I have left on earth. And now I should be glad to see your children.</P>
<P>They were weeping at a table, whence their father brought them to Susanna, putting them upon their knees beside her, while she raised herself a little, so that she might see them, and began:</P>
<P>My dearest children, I am very sorry that I must leave you motherless and poor. Think often of me, my sweet babes. I have nothing that I can give you but this book: it has been frequently my consolation, and as often will be yours. When you have learned sufficiently, read in it every evening to your father. It will teach you to be good; and if you are but good, you cannot fail of being happy.</P>
<P>This, Duncan, <STAGE>(<HI>taking out a piece of paper from the leather bag,</HI>)</STAGE> is a certificate which I brought your father of my good behaviour at our marriage. Let it pass by turns to each of your three daughters, till they marry. It is my last request. And as for you, my son, I have nothing in the world to give you in remembrance of me; but the comfort is, you want none. You will not forget me, I am certain.</P>
<P>Gertrude, shall I request one other favour of you, after having pardoned Arthur? When I am dead, see now and then to these poor children.—They have no one friend.— I recommend you in particular my poor dear Lucy.—She is the youngest of the three.—Where is she?—I can hardly see.— <STAGE>(<HI>She stretches out her arm with difficulty.</HI>)</STAGE></P>
<P>Conduct my hand, and let me touch her.—O my chil∣dren! <STAGE>(<HI>she dies.</HI>)</STAGE></P>
<P>After a moment's silence, Duncan supposing her to be fallen asleep, said softly to his children, Rise, and do not disturb her slumber. Might she but recover, after having
<PB N="190" REF="196"/>had this unexpected rest! But Gertrude saw plainly that she was dead, and gave Duncan to understand as much. What was his distraction then, and that of his helpless family? How they wept and wrung their hands! How they beat upon their breasts, and tore their hair up by the roots for anguish.</P>
<P>Gertrude, as well as she was able, comforted their sor∣row, and repeated to Duncan Susanna's parting words, which, in his grief, he had not heard distinctly.</P>
<P>She began that very day to shew how much she valued the deceased, by complying with her last wish. The little orphans being brought up with her own dear children, had the same instruction; and improving by it, grew in time to be a pattern for the village; and particularly Ar∣thur, continually having in remembrance his first fault, became remarkable in time for his fidelity and honest dealing.</P>

<HEAD>PASCAL.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Dawkins was accustomed every Saturday to pay his only son, a little boy whose name was Pascal, an allowance, such as was sufficient to procure him, the week through, those little pleasures and enjoyments which children of his age so naturally pursue. No less confident than generous, he never looked for an account from Pascal of the way in which he laid out what he gave him. He supposed his principles to be such, that he would not abuse his bounty, but remember the instruction which he had so frequently given him upon the subject. But what lamentable consequences did this too blind credulity pro∣duce?</P>
<P>For hardly ever had he touched his weekly payment, but he ran that moment to a shop hard by, and stuffed himself with pastry and nice things. His purse, in this first onset, underwent so great a diminution, that a very little the next day was sufficient to exhaust it totally: and during the last part of every week, he never had a far∣thing to regale himself withal; yet he did not, upon that account, the less hanker after the same delicacies. Where∣fore
<PB N="191" REF="197"/>being resolved to gratify his palate, he prevailed upon the pastry-cook, at first, to give him credit; but when afterwards he found that the boy's allowance was never applied to pay off these arrears, while on the other hand the debt increased, he saw that it was prudent to give in his bill to Mr. Dawkins. Mr. Dawkins was extremely angry with the tradesman, reprimanded his improper con∣duct, and forbade not only <HI>him,</HI> but every tradesman round about, to let his son have any thing for which he could not pay on the spot. This might have been sup∣posed a good precaution; and accordingly he thought it could not but become a check on Pascal's gluttony; whereas it only irritated matters, and the boy, as we shall see, at any risque resolved to gratify his palate.</P>
<P>Pascal's chamber was contiguous to his father's. After having noticed when his father generally slept the soundest, he once got up softly, came into his room, and feeling for his breeches, took out half a crown. Emboldened by this fatal success, he frequently repeated his offence, and for a time without detection: but there cannot be a crime, however secretly committed, which does not come to light at last.</P>
<P>It chanced that Mr. Dawkins, some time after Pascal's first offence, in this way, had a law-suit on the following day to be decided. Having thought upon it waking, it is not to be wondered at that it should take up his attention after he was gone to rest. In fact, he lay quite silent, ru∣minating on the affair, when Pascal, thinking him asleep, got up as he was wont to do. Unhappily for him, the moon threw light enough into the chamber, that a person coming in might easily be seen. Accordingly let any one imagine if he can, what Mr. Dawkins must have felt, be∣holding his own son thus come and rob him! He for that time stifled his resentment; but before the thief could quit his chamber in the morning, he got up, went to him, and found means to turn the conversation into such a channel, as to ask him how much he intended to lay out that day of his allowance. Nothing, answered Pascal. I have given all my last week's money to a poor man in the neighbourhood, and must deny myself a little till next Saturday.</P>
<P>His father could not possibly restrain his indignation any longer, hearing so detestable a lie come from him.
<PB N="192" REF="198"/>He sprung forward, seized him by the collar, for by this time he was dressed, and found five shillings in his pocket, which was what he had stolen from his father. In pro∣portion as he had till now been tender and indulgent to his son, so much the greater was his severity and rigour on this occasion: for his reprimands were only the pre∣amble to a harsher treatment, and the wretched Pascal was obliged to keep his bed for many days, in consequence of the correction that he received.</P>
<P>How difficult it is to extirpate a vice which has once taken root within us! Pascal was not cured by this cor∣rection. Mr. Dawkins left the key of his bureau one evening in the lock, and Pascal took a model of the wards, and got another made at the smith's. This gave him a convenient opportunity to rob his father whenever he pleased: who, as he usually kept a great deal of cash by him, and as Pascal was more cunning than to take too much at once, suspected nothing of the affair. He was now fifteen years of age, and could dissemble so well, that his parents thought him quite reformed, till his hypocrisy was accidentally discovered.</P>
<P>His father had received a piece of foreign coin, among other monies, which he soon remarked, and put it up in the bureau. This piece fell into Pascal's hands that very night, and Mr. Dawkins missing it the next morning, could not but bethink himself of Pascal's former inclina∣tions, and suspect him. He resolved to satisfy himself that moment, and examining his pockets, found the piece of money that he had lost, together with the key, by means of which he had obtained it.</P>
<P>But Pascal by this time was too big for such correction as he had received before, and therefore Mr. Dawkins contented himself with severely upbraiding him for the present, and threatening to withdraw the benefits of his affection from him. He consulted a few faithful friends that he had, upon the treatment proper to be shewn him: their opinion was in general, that the harshest method of proceeding would most tend to his amendment, and ad∣vised his being sent to school in Yorkshire, where for years he might not see his family, but be subjected to the rigor∣ous discipline and homely fare peculiar to such institu∣tions, and of course have leisure to repent of his enormity, and be accustomed to a frugal way of life. This was
<PB N="193" REF="199"/>their counsel; but the combats of paternal love in Mr. Dawkins's bosom, which was very far, as yet, from being quite extinct, would not permit him to pursue their salu∣tary admonition; he inclined to something of a gentler nature, and in grief of heart, and as the only moderate method which he could devise to preserve him from de∣struction, sent that very day to Bristol for a friend of his, who kept a boarding school, to whose attention he con∣signed, upon the day of his arrival, this unworthy son, with directions to let him have no other money than was absolutely necessary for his wants. His friend set off on his return immediately, and Pascal with him.</P>
<P>This was a precaution; but it came, alas! too late: the youth's principles were utterly corrupted. His tutor's table was plain, though very plentiful; for which reason Pascal would go out, and at a tavern gratify his palate with the choicest wines and viands, for which he easily got credit, as his host took care to make enquiry, first of all, into his father's circumstances, who, he found, was very rich: nor did he stop at this; for to supply that want of money which his tutor would not, he began to play, and practised every species of deception at a gaming∣house hard by.</P>
<P>God's providence, as if it interfered particularly to reform him, punished all his vices on the spot. Three gamblers, his companions, who detected him endeavour∣ing to deceive them with a pack of cards that he had be∣forehand sorted for the purpose, fell upon him unawares, and so rough were the effects of their vengeance, that Pascal was almost drubbed to death upon the spot.</P>
<P>He was carried home with scarce the least remains of life, and put to bed. His tutor ran to see him, and af∣forded all the succour and assistance in his power. He waited till he saw him almost reestablished, to impart such counsel as might possibly affect him; which he did with all the softness possible, and pointed out the horrors into which he was plunging himself. Miserable youth! said the tutor, what can have induced you to excesses so dis∣graceful! You dishonour, by your crimes, a name which the probity of those before you had exalted, and made really respectable. You rob your tender parents of those hopes which they indulged when first they laid the ground∣work of your education. When the youth of your ac∣quaintance,
<PB N="194" REF="200"/>who now consecrate that time to study which you consume in scandalous excesses, shall be sought out by their country and employed in elevated stations, you will be considered as an abject dangerous character. You will be banished from all company that have the least re∣gard or value for their honour, and the meanest class of men will scorn you.</P>
<P>Pascal was at first affected with this lesson. He broke off all commerce with his partners; he was satisfied with his preceptor's table-fare; and seemed as if beginning to imagine that study had some charms to please him. But this disposition was soon done away, and by degrees he relapsed into his former way of life. He sold his books; his watch and clothes went afterwards; and he contrived to strip himself of his apparel so completely, that he could not stir abroad.</P>
<P>On which his creditors came all at once upon him, and receiving a refusal from the tutor to discharge the young man's debts and satiate their avidity, they wrote letters to the father, threatening to arrest him if they were not paid. Let Pascal's situation now be imagined. Overwhelmed with the repreaches of his creditors, the indignation of his tutor, the contempt of those who waited on him, and his own remorse, he had moreover to dread the maledic∣tion of his parents. He was sensible that he had so much neglected to improve his understanding, that he could not find the least resources against want in any calling or pro∣fession. He began to think his situation desperate. A whole day he passed in his apartment violently agitated; every now and then he wrung his hands, tore his hair, and cursed his vices: but at night, still borne away by his depravity, he went from home to spend the little money that he had left in a tavern.</P>
<P>Accident that evening threw two men into his com∣pany who were employed to raise recruits for India. They remarked upon his countenance the embarrassment with which his soul was agitated, winked to one another, and began to talk of India. They described the beauty of the country, and what pay was given to the soldiery. They spoke of the advantages that a youth of family might meet with there, and what a probability there was, that such a one might make his fortune: nay, they went so far as to assert that many, to their knowledge, had from
<PB N="195" REF="201"/>private soldiers been made officers, and married wealthy widows.</P>
<P>Pascal heard this conversation with avidity, joined in the discourse, and enquired if it was difficult to be en∣listed with these soldiers. If you wish to enlist, said they, we can oblige you, though we have more recruits by many than we want; but you, by your appearance, seem to claim the preference; and thereupon they offered him five guineas if he would enter.</P>
<P>After some slight struggles, Pascal took the guineas, and enlisted. The remainder of the night he spent in drinking; and when morning came, was sent to learn his exercise. He found himself surrounded by a set of auk∣ward rustics, runaway apprentices, notorious beggars, and convicted thieves, who had enlisted to escape the gal∣lows. He was under the tuition of a surly corporal, who loaded him from time to time with curses, and severely caned him, when he could not comprehend his meaning.</P>
<P>Pascal's misery went on from day to day encreasing. All the money that he had lately touched at parting with his freedom, was already gone in riot. He had nothing to subsist on but the coarse provision granted by the com∣pany to keep their new recruits together. Lubberkin, who had been a swine-herd, and was then his comrade, was much better off. He had been always used to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive on o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ten bread, and therefore thought himself a prince, when he could get a bit of half-baked meat. But what were Pascal's feelings, when, partaking of such coarse pro∣visions, he reflected on the delicacies of his former repasts!</P>
<P>Some days after came an order for the soldiers to em∣bark. Pascal heard this news with much more satisfac∣tion than the people round about him thought he would have testified. If once you get to India, said he to him∣self, as you are young, and of a likely figure, you will make your fortune, as a multitude of Englishmen have done before you.</P>
<P>In the midst of all these brilliant prospects, Pascal went on board the vessel destined to transport him and his com∣rades. He drank down a glass or two of brandy at the moment of embarking, and the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> served to warm hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> head, and to make him utterly forget his parents. He went off with mad huzzas. But then the joy with which he ut∣tered these huzzas continued hardly longer than the
<PB N="196" REF="202"/>drunkenness that caused them. Those on board who were now for the first time in their life at sea, began to feel a death-like sickness. Pascal, whose intemperance had hurt his inside much, endured a great deal more than any other. He was several days insensible, and nothing staid upon his stomach. Even the sight of food disgusted him; and when at last he grew a little better, and was hungry, mouldy pease, salt beef, and biscuits full of mag∣gots, were the only victuals that he could procure. When he first set sail, the soldiers had a pint of beer each allowed them; but by degrees they were deprived of this indul∣gence, and compelled to put up with a bare sufficiency of water, and even this they were obliged to strain before they could drink it.</P>
<P>After six long months incessant suffering, during all which time they were in fear of continual shipwreck, they arrived in India, wearied out with watchings for the most part, and a dreadful scurvy. Pascal was marched up the country, with his comrades, to the army: but his heart, embittered by the horror of his situation, was insensible of any thing like goodness. His abandoned course of life, the crimes that he was incessantly committing, and his numberless desertions, frequently subjected him to pu∣nishment. He was determined, if he could, to quit these regions, watched his opportunity, and stealing on board a vessel bound to England, hid himself below till it had sailed; nor did he quit his hiding place, till the ship was a great way out to sea: he then came sorth, and being brought before the captain, promised to work his passage to England; which the captain in the end accepted, as the vessel was in want of men.</P>
<P>What, in the interim, was become of his unhappy pa∣rents? They alas! still lived, if people may be said to live whose sad days are spent in anguish and despair. The crimes which their son had committed, and with which the neighbourhood all around them rung, had forced them to renounce their place of habitation, and go down and live in Sussex, in a solitary quarter near the sea.</P>
<P>A short time after they were settled here, the ship, in which Pascal was, arrived on that very part of the coast where they had fixed their retirement. For while they were a little way out to sea, Pascal, a thorough graduate in vice, had conspired with ten or twelve desperate fellows
<PB N="197" REF="203"/>of the crew, to murder every one on board who would not join in their conspiracy, and so obtain possession of the ship. They executed their infernal purpose; and soon after running the vessel ashore, they hoisted out their boat at night, that they might come on shore, and pillage the inhabitants.</P>
<P>That very night the unhappy Mr. Dawkins in his house was up, and watching by his wife's sick bed. Her grief for Pascal's wretched fortune had long preyed upon her constitution; and by this time, after having suffered grievously, she felt the agonies of death upon her. In the intervals of her delirium, she called out for Pascal: Where, where are you, said the dying mother? Come, that I may press you to my heart, and pardon you before I die. At this the door is suddenly burst open, and ten villains rush into the dwelling. Pascal, with a hatchet in his hand, was first, and led them on. The father comes to meet them with a candle; but before his son could recollect him—The remainder is too horrid to relate: suffice it, that Pascal and his gang were apprehended on the spot, and suffered at the gallows.</P>
<P>Children, if when you have read this story, you dare think of giving way to any vice whatsoever, tremble at the possibility of your becoming criminal by degrees, and ending like Pascal with the crime of parricide!</P>

<SPEAKER>The Countess,</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(<HI>to Julia coming in.</HI>)</STAGE> Who told you, miss, to use my silver counters? Did not I forbid you to meddle with them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was not my fault, mama.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Countess.</SPEAKER>
<P>And whose then, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Hon. Mr. Oddly's and his sister's. I had got the ivory counters, when they asked me if I meant to
<PB N="200" REF="206"/>play with them, as they never had such at home, and must have better; upon which they opened all the drawers and closets till they met with these.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Countess.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why did not you mention that I would never let <HI>you</HI> use them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good! as if they would hear me! I believe they would have beat us, had we not surrendered them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word! These children, as it seems, are charmingly brought up!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Countess.</SPEAKER>
<P>You should at least have counted them when you left off playing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was what I wished to do. But after I had got to twenty-four or thereabouts, Mr. Oddly snatched them from me, put them up pell-mell, and dragged us out into the garden with him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Countess.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you know that six are missing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sure, mama!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Countess.</SPEAKER>
<P>How! sure! when I have told you! See now whether one can trust you in the least! You know, it was your duty to take care of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was confounded, dear mama; these children are so mischievous! I was obliged to have my eye conti∣nually on them, as I thought they would have broke your china. I was obliged frequently to follow them about the room: they may have flung the counters, then, into some corner or another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Countess.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but I must have them found.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know but one way, madam. Were I you, I would turn the little master's pockets inside out before they left the house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Countess.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fie, Jenny! would you have me affront their parents?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! I am sure, mama, not one among them can have stolen the counters,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Countess.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I think; but children of their age may be a little giddy-headed. So go to them, Julia, and politely ask if any one among them may not by mistake have put them up into his pocket. Your commission is a nice one, and requires a little management. Take care not to offend them, by insinuating that you think any one of the company capable of taking them purposely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall take care, mama.</P>

<P>Here I am, my lady: what is your pleasure?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Countess.</SPEAKER>
<P>To inform you, Robert, that I have lost since yesterday six counters.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does your ladyship suspect me of taking them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Countess.</SPEAKER>
<P>God forbid! I am too well acquainted with your honesty for that. But I suppose, if you had crossed the room, you might have seen them on some chair or elsewhere.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Counters on a chair?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Countess.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know, that is not a proper place for counters; but the children have been playing where they were, and might have inconsiderately left them in some corner, and you seen them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my lady, I have not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Countess.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry for it, and do not know what method to pursue. They must have certainly been lost since morning, as I counted them myself last night.—But look about.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your ladyship has seen how I have been search∣ing for them. Servants are but badly off, when any thing is lost about a house. However honest they may be, they are constantly suspected.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="202" REF="208"/>
<SPEAKER>The Countess.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very likely; but the honest servant will on this occasion pardon me, if I include her in my search of the dishonest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may first of all examine me, my lady. Rogues are constantly the first to be displeased when they are suspected.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>God be thanked, I have no fear of that sort! But it cannot be a matter of indifference to the honest servant, when a thief is in the house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Countess.</SPEAKER>
<P>But put yourself into my place; what would you do? Think, Robert.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do, my lady?—A thought this moment strikes me; and provided I have leave to put it into execution, I will engage to find the counters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Countess.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you must not think of giving any one occasion to suppose himself suspected.—What is your design?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot at present tell your ladyship. A single syllable might spoil the business. Do but bring together all the children in the adjoining room. I promise you, the thief, if there is any thief among them, shall betray himself.</P>

<P>No, mama: I have only learned that six are lost. My sister told us so just this moment.</P>

<P>And how was the intelligence received?</P>

<P>We were exceedingly surprized. The two Davenports particularly, and their sister, want to come and plead their innocence before you.</P>

<P>Plead! they are the last that I should suspect of such a deed. And the Hon. Mr. Oddly—</P>

<P>Oh! he is furious; and told Julia, that to look upon him as a thief, was but a bad reception.</P>

<SPEAKER>The Countess.</SPEAKER>
<P>Julia was not rude, I hope, in telling them my message.</P>

<SPEAKER>Augustus.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, mama, quite otherwise. She spoke with great politeness.</P>

<P>Then pray why was Mr. Oddly angry? There was nothing personal in what your sister said.</P>

<P>I cannot well tell the reason; but Eliza drew him privately aside: he would not condescend to hear her. He is determined to be gone: his hat is fortunately here; he will come and fetch it, and declares that he will not remain a minute in the house. He threatens to complain to his papa.</P>

<P>Positively he must not go. I will tell his lordship the whole affair myself, when he comes to take him home.</P>

<SPEAKER>Augustus.</SPEAKER>
<P>The rest wish greatly for permission to appear and justify themselves before you.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Countess.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is no need of that. I only wished to know if they could give me any information of the counters.

<P>Well, how fares it with you all, my little friends? I am glad to see you here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Hon. Mr. Oddly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Miss Julia has just now informed us, that your ladyship has lost six counters of the number with which unluckily we were playing. I am sorry for it; but could never think that your ladyship would have sus∣pected any one of us of having taken them. At least I can assure you for my sister and myself, that we know no∣thing of them.</P>

<P>God forbid that I should suspect such well∣bred children, as I look upon you all to be. Sure Julia did not tell you that I supposed you to have the counters?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>No, my lady; all that she said, was to enquire if we had brought them out through inattention, or to play a little longer with them in the garden.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>My dear children, I have already told you that I am far from suspecting any of you to have them, when you say that you have not. They are certainly of no great value; yet I cannot but confess, that their loss affects me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Hon. Mr. Oddly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Were they only worth a straw, they are your ladyship's, and should not now be missing. But you know, there are such things as servants; and they

<P>But it is the first time that any thing of the kind has happened in our house, dear Mr. Oddly, I assure you.</P>

<P>Did not your old footman come in likewise? I do not like his looks; and should not chuse to meet him in a lane at night.</P>

<P>Fie, sir! what makes you thus suspect the honest Robert? He was my father-in-law's confidential servant, and has been much longer in the family than even I myself. If <HI>he</HI> could possibly turn pilferer, neither you nor I could know what living creature we might trust.</P>

<P>It is not unlikely then, but some one may have got into the room when we were gone.</P>

<P>You speak of us, sir, I can see: your looks inform me so. But let me tell you, in my turn, that it is one's manners and principles, and not birth, that makes one truly noble.</P>

<P>How these tradesmen talk about their manners! You are very happy that there are so few children hereabout, and that Augustus and myself are forced to make you our companions, or have no diversion. Did you live in London, you would not have such an honour, notwithstanding your fine manners.</P>

<P>Well then, my haughty little gentleman! and is it possible you could be guilty of so scandalous an action?

They have at present their reverge, since they may call you, and with justice, a vile thief!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Hon. Mr. Oddly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray pardon me, my lady!—I was playing with the counters—and without considering at the moment, must have put them into my pocket.—I have no other method of accounting for their being found upon me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Countess.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pitiful excuse! that aggravates your fault! At such a tender age as yours, could I have possibly ima∣gined one with so much front?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Hon. Mr. Oddly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Believe me, madam, I had cer∣tainly no had design!—I took them without meaning so to do, and afterwards concealed the matter, from my crend of being taken for a thief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Countess.</SPEAKER>
<P>But after I had bid my daughter make enquiry for them with such delicacy, you might easily have seemed to search your peckets, and restored them without blushing. Your proceeding would have then been looked up was nothing but an inadvertoncy.</P>

<P>I did not think of that, my lady.</P>

<P>What then did you think, when you durst drop hints that possibly my honest servants might have taken them? or that my children's little friends were ob∣jects of suspicion?

<P>Hold your tongue, you little rascal!— for that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is not too bad for your deservings. Hap∣plly, as yet, you have not got sufficient cunning to con∣ceal your wicked actions. <HI>You did stroke the cock!</HI> Is that then your assertion? Do not you see, that if you had, you would have blacked your hands as well as all the others,
<PB N="215" REF="221"/>Robert having smeared him over with a certain composi∣tion? Your companions were not in the least afraid to stroke him, as their conscience did not any way reproach them for the theft; but as for you, the apprehension lest the servant's artifice might really be conju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation awed you, and the means that you chose to avoid detection have be∣trayed you. Oh! how politic you thought yourself, I warrant, in pretending only, as you did, to stroke the cock; but honesty you would have found much better policy. You deserve that I should tell my lord, your father, of your laudable behaviour, when he comes to fetch you.</P>

</SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Countess.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very wicked sort of reasoning this! For, granting that no one upon earth suspected you, do not you know that God sees and punishes whatever people do amiss? Perhaps, however, this event is for your be∣nefit; and you will prove more likely to amend, when you have once been punished as you merit.</P>

<SPEAKER>The Hon. Mr. Oddly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let it be by you, my lady, or by any one, but not by my papa. Let him know nothing of the matter, I conjure you. Tell it, if you please, to my mama, but keep the matter from his knowledge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Countess.</SPEAKER>
<P>There again! You would not have your father know it, as you fear the blows that he might be∣stow upon you. Thus, it is nothing but an abjectness that guides you, even in the work of your repentance; and it is not for his peace of mind that you would conceal it from him, for you are not afraid lest your mama should know it, because she would not beat you. It is not your idea to consult her peace of mind.</P>
