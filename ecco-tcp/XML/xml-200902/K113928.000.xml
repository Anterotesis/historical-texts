<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD>To the Revd. Mr. WARTON.</HEAD>
<P>SIR,</P>
<P>YOU will have no reason to be either alarmed or offended at a mode of address, which every reader has a right to adopt. The author of a book upon a subject designed for and attractive of public attention gives a general challenge. If his facts and opinions stand the test of a fair and candid enquiry, he is entitled to universal patronage and approbation: if not, contempt and oblivion should be his fate. The "History of English Poetry" stands high in public estimation; the subject is equally curious, interesting, and abstruse: much, very much, of its success is, undoubtedly, to be ascribed to the opinion generally entertained of your veracity and care as a historian; and upon an idea so universal, so satisfactory, and hitherto so undisturbed, it may seem in∣vidious not to have been content entirely to rely. I, however, Sir, am some∣what too restless in my enquiries, too desirous of being able to judge for myself, to be satisfyed either with a writers reputation, or with the opinion of the world; at least, when I have it in my power to learn how deservedly that reputation has been acquired, or how justly that opinion is formed. In pursuit of these objects, I have read and examined your great and important work with some degree of attention and accuracy; and I now present you with the result of my enquiries: the public disclosure of which will not, I flatter myself, either to you, or your numerous readers, prove an unacceptable service. If, in some few instances, I may be thought to have betrayed a warmth of expression, from which reputation so high, abilities so uncommon, and a profession so sacred, ought to have been wholely exempt, let me, once for all, observe, that, having no other object in view, no other end to answer, than truth and justice, I neither wish nor intend to consider you otherwise than as author of the work in question. Personal motives I cannot possibly have been influenced by, and
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>utterly disavow. And were you able to falsify every charge I have here brought against you, whatever might be your severity, I should kiss the rod with resig∣nation, and even pleasure: as, I assure you, the satisfaction I should have ex∣perienced, in finding your work entirely free from error, would have been in∣finitely beyond any I can be supposed to feel, in thus making myself the public instrument of its detection.</P>

<HEAD>VOL. I. </HEAD>
<P>Preface</P>
<P>Page vi.</P>
<P>That "some perhaps will be of opinion, that these annals ought to have commenced with a view of Saxon poetry," is a very natural and judicious conjecture. "The legitimate illustration of that jejune and intricate subject," would undoubtedly "have doubled 'your' labour," and required, I fear, a more profound and extensive erudition, as well as a more penetrating judge∣ment, than were, perhaps, necessary for the aera whence you have thought pro∣per to deduce this important history. "That the Saxon language is familiar only to a few learned antiquaries, that our Saxon poems are little more than religious rhapsodies, and that scarce any compositions remain marked with the native images of that people in their pagan state <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">It may seem a very extraordinary idea in a Christian minister, and who is not only the historian of poets, but a poet hisself, that these people could not have a poetical genius, be∣cause they were not pagans; and that religion and poetry are incompatible. The notion, however strange, may yet in some degree be just: The Saxons, like many other nations, really seem to have got very little "by the <HI>swop.</HI>"</NOTE>, we will readyly allow; because, admitting the positions to be true, they prove nothing; they are per∣fectly harmless: But, "that the Saxon poetry has NO CONNECTION with the nature and purpose of 'your' PRESENT UNDERTAKING," is an assertion, one may safely venture to say, as new as it is ill-grounded, and full of mischief. Though the great revolution produced by the Norman invaders effected "that signal change in our policy, constitution, and public manners," which has in its consequences "reached modern times," yet neither the Saxon people nor the Saxon tongue was thereby eradicated. You, Sir, have sometimes been a blographer; and did you ever find it necessary to commence the story of your hero at the 15th or 16th year of his age, and to assert that the time of his birth and infancy had no connection with the story of his life, because, forsooth, he was become a very different person when grown up and sent to college, from what he was when born, breeched, and sent to school? And yet one may well doubt, whether such an apology would not have answered your purpose just as effectually in that case, as your reason for declining to enter upon the state of
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>the Saxon poetry does in this. The truth is, that the origin and fundamental principles, as well of our language as of our poetry, are to be sought for among the remains of the Saxon literature <NOTE N="(2)" PLACE="foot">You admit this by the very first page of your history; you doubtless perceived your in∣consistency, though you did not, I suppose, expect that any of your readers would do so.</NOTE>; and he who shall tell us that the English and Saxon languages have not sort of connection with each other, is either de∣ceived hisself, or finds it his interest to deceive others,—by sheltering his own ignorance or inactivity under a formidable and laboured shew of difficulty and uselessness, equally visionary, delusive, and pernicious.</P>
<P>P. viii.</P>
<P>Whether you have gratifyed "the reader of taste," by your exertions on this subject, I know not; but of this I am confident, that "the anti∣quarian" will have greater reason to be dissatisfyed with being perplexed or misled, than to thank you for having engaged in a task for which it will appear you have been so little qualifyed.</P>
<P>I shall pass by the two dissertations which precede your history without observation <NOTE N="(3)" PLACE="foot">You have somewhere observed, that we have a kind of malicious pleasure in detecting the secret resources and petty thefts of a great writer; and the remark is just and natural, with respect to the pleasure; which does not, I trust, so much result from malice, as from a secret re∣gard to truth, and an indignant warmth at seeing the daw strut abroad in his stolen plumes. Whatever may be the cause, I shall in the course of this enquiry have many opportunities or proving the justice of the observation. And, firstly, you will be pleased to take notice, that the greatest and best part of your note <HI>(t)</HI> (Dis. I. sign. a. 4. <HI>b.</HI>) in which you, with an equal parade of ingenuity and learning, account for an interpolation, by Geoffrey of Monmouth, into his translation of the British history, has been found to be almost literally <HI>borrowed</HI> from Mr. Cartes preface to the first vol. of his History of England. I have likewise some little reason to suppose, though I do not think worth my while to prove, that you owe more obligation to Sheltons translation of Wottons View of Dr. Hickeses Thesaurus, than to the Thesaurus itsself.</NOTE>; not that I think them altogether just and proper, but because I find that a strict examination would require greater leisure, and more intense application, as well as a more frequent reference to the numerous and uncom∣mon books there quoted (many of which I have, by the way, much reason to suspect you never consulted, nor even ever saw) than I am at present either wil∣ling or able to devote to it. I do not, at the same time, wish to detract from whatever merit you may have in this ingenious structure: I onely desire the reader to be particularly cautious and distrustful, as he wanders over these ex∣tensive regions of FABLE and ROMANCE. One may, however, venture to assert, that, let your facts and reasonings in the first of these dissertations be ever so just, yet will they by no means prove any thing like what you produce them for,—the introduction of romantic fiction into Europe; which is rather to be sought for in the history of the Gauls, or other Celtic nations, who were settled
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>in Europe some thousand years before you suppose the Goths to have arrived in this part of the world, and had doubtless "a very sufficient stock of lies of their own growth <NOTE N="(4)" PLACE="foot">Tyrwhitt <HI>versus</HI> Warburton. Supplement to Shakspeare, i. 373.</NOTE>," without being beholden to Asiatic adventurers.</P>
<P>I shall not give myself the trouble to minute <HI>every</HI> inaccuracy I might dis∣cover in the citations you have introduced from the old metrical legends, be∣tween your 7th and 26th page: I take it for granted they are just as correct as I shall prove others to be, which you have given from MSS. in the Cotton and Harleian libraries; many of which, as one may easyly perceive, by your method of quoting, referring to, or registering them, you have certainly never seen.</P>
<P>P. 26.</P>
<P>One cannot help taking notice of your frequent forewardness in deter∣mining the age of poetical compositions, or the MSS. which contain them. In this page you produce a love-song, the oldest you can discover, which you "would place before or about the year 1200." This you cite from a MS. appearing, as you elsewhere <NOTE N="(5)" PLACE="foot">P. 28.</NOTE> tell us, to be of the hand-writing of the reign of king Edward the first: but <HI>an Elegy upon his</HI> DEATH, which you have printed, in another place <NOTE N="(6)" PLACE="foot">P. 103.</NOTE>, from this very MS. might have served to shew you the ab∣surdity of dating it in his LIFE-TIME. The truth is, the book evidently ap∣pears to have been written in the reign of his son and successor; and there is not the least reason for concluding any poem in it to be much older than the year 1300.</P>
<P>The Revd. Dr. Percy (now lord bishop of Dromore), whose knowlege in these matters seems pretty much upon a level with your own, has brought its age down so low as the reign of king Richard II. <NOTE N="(7)" PLACE="foot">Reliques of Ancient Poetry, ii. 3.</NOTE></P>
<P>I cannot, willingly, dismiss this same love-song, without giving a specimen or two of the extreme correctness with which it is printed, and the extreme pro∣priety with which it is explained.</P>
<P>"With lokkes lefliche and longe." <HI>Lefliche,</HI> you say, is "lively;" and a most curious explanation to be sure it is! The <HI>lively locks</HI> of a young lady! Charming creature! she must have been a perfect Medusa! But, possibly, you mistook <HI>lokkes</HI> for <HI>looks;</HI> and then we have the <HI>lively and</HI> long <HI>looks</HI> of the said fair one! If this famous history of yours should have the great and unmerited good fortune to come to a second edition, you will do well to subtract one fault, by correcting <HI>lively</HI> to <HI>lovely;</HI> and another, by writing <HI>lure lumes</HI> instead of <HI>bire limmes:</HI> for though old poetry may be the same thing to you, sense or nonsense, it may not be so to every one who is tempted to look into your book. The great blank, a few lines
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>further, you may fill up with the little word <HI>wes:</HI> but, indeed, you would do much better to get a fresh transcript, as there are fifty other mistakes in the copy you have printed: and all the rest of the extracts from this and every other MS. throughout the volume, and indeed the whole work, are in the same predicament. It would, moreover, be as well, not to call the verses be∣ginning "Hyrdmen [hem] hatieth ant vch mones hyne," a different ballad from that on the lawyers; as, had you inspected the MS. instead of the catalogue, you would have found both to be one and the same piece.</P>
<P>P. 43, 44, 45, 46.</P>
<P>We are here favoured with a satyrical ballad upon Richard king of the Romans, brother to our Henry III. preserved in the above MS. which you, in a note, tell us you "had transcribed from the British Mu∣seum, and written the explanations upon, BEFORE 'you' knew that it was printed in the SECOND [FIRST] edition of Doctor Percy's Ballads."—Now, Mr. Warton, listen to me for a single moment, and <HI>"mark how a plain tale shall put you down."</HI> Dr. (now Bp.) Percy, in printing this song, has taken some liberties with the orthography and language (and where is the piece with which he has not taken such liberties?) in particular, he has altered the word <HI>cop</HI> <NOTE N="(8)" PLACE="foot"><P>"Sire Simond de Montfort hath suore by ys <HI>cop," i. e.</HI> cap or head. Thus, in the ancient Erench romance of Girart de Vienne, MS.</P>
<P>Þ mon <HI>cap</HI> dist. G. men uoil gardar.</P></NOTE>, which he did <HI>not</HI> understand, to <HI>fot,</HI> which, it is to be supposed, he <HI>did.</HI> In this alteration, and indeed throughout the whole poem, YOU, Mr. Warton, have followed him with a most literal and servile exactness. Still, however, you might have escaped undetected, and have pilfered "your ingenious friend and fellow-labourer" with safety; but, unluckyly, his lordships accuracy, being much of a piece with your own, suffered him to omit a complete stanza; which could not possibly have eluded the observation of a second copyist: but I look in vain for it in YOUR (different) transcript. However, as it may be some small consolation to you in this unfortunate dilemma, I will here give it you.</P>
<Q><L>Be þe luef be þe loht sire edward,</L>

This omission of the ingenious prelate is the more astonishing, not onely as the verse immediately follows what he has copyed, but because Mr. Wanley says, in his catalogue, that the song expressly mentions prince Edward, which it onely does in this verse <NOTE N="(9)" PLACE="foot">At p. 103, is another poem [the Elegy on Ed. I.] from the Reliques; but there too it <HI>escaped you, till just before the work went to the press, that the Dr. had printed it.</HI> Credat Judaeus Apella; non ego.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I shall make no remark on the obvious wonder of your forgetting the prin∣cipal contents of a book, from which you are continually quoting passages—as your own; a favour, indeed, that many writers have to acknowlege, beside his lordship of Dromore.</P>
<P>P. 52.</P>
<P>"The king and ys conseil <HI>radde</HI> the stones for to fette." <HI>Radde</HI> you boldly say is <HI>Rode.</HI> Writers who want in knowlege should abound in care. Had you read three lines further, you would have discovered that the king and his council did NOT <HI>ride.</HI>—It means <HI>advised.</HI></P>
<P>P. 53.</P>
<P>No one, I sincerely believe, except yourself, could have supposed, for a moment, that the name of HENGIST deserved the slightest attention, in giving the etymology of the word STONEHENGE:—than which nothing can be more simple and apparent; as it is communicated by the word itsself: <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>hanging stone.</HI></P>
<P>P. 58.</P>
<P>"In the reign of Henry the sixth, we find a ballad stuck on the gates of the royal palace.… This piece is preserved in the Ashmolean museum."</P>
<P>It is no ballad; and the reference would have been just as easy, and much more useful, to Hearnes HEMINGI CHARTULARIUM, p. 663. Whence, I dare lay my life, you had your information.</P>
<P>P. 67.</P>
<P>"What maner schap with me so <HI>ferd.</HI>"</P>
<P>Why, <HI>Lay?</HI> Fared.</P>
<P>"Of elde avenaunt."</P>
<P>Not, "I was then young and beautiful," but—<HI>of a fit age.</HI></P>
<P>It may not be improper, once for all, to warn the reader, that you interpret every where at random; and not because you perfectly understand, but because you are entirely ignorant of, the word you pretend to explain. I must, how∣ever, do you the justice to except a variety of words, to which you have affixed
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>the proper meanings, where the merest school-boy could not have been at a loss for them: and for the multitude of really difficult ones which you have left untouched, your readers owe you infinite obligations.</P>
<P>P. 68.</P>
<P>Poor old Cotgrave is here attacked for, what you call, absurdly interpreting <HI>mangoneau</HI> (<HI>magnel</HI> in your text) <HI>an old-fashioned sling.</HI> You, indeed, say, "it is a <HI>catapult</HI> or <HI>battering ram</HI> <NOTE N="(10)" PLACE="foot">I observe, that this ingenious explication is, with many other blunders, of greater and less consequence, afterwards directed to be destroyed. You should, however, have destroyed it yourself. It would not, surely, be a sufficient atonement for the impudence or ignorance of a writer, whose work was one continued mistake, to direct his readers to—<HI>dele</HI> the whole. You will not, however, have many similar instances of hardship to complain of.</NOTE>." But, pray, Mr. Warton, who told you so? or where did you learn that a <HI>catapult</HI> was the same thing as a <HI>battering ram?</HI> Cotgrave undoubtedly knew a thousand million times more of the matter than you can do: and, to prove that you know nothing at all about it, let me intreat you to read your own text; you will there find that the <HI>magnels</HI> were to be used by people UPON the wall, against those who came to assail it. Was that the place and use of a <HI>battering ram?</HI> The very passage shews Cotgrave to be right: and his explanation is further confirmed by a line at p. 72, where, though the word <HI>magneles</HI> is joined with <HI>slinges,</HI> and evidently signifies some∣thing of the same nature, you have the confidence to refer the reader to the above nonsense at p. 68.</P>
<P>P. 75.</P>
<P>"Danz Robert of Meltone."</P>
<P>"Sir Robert of Malton. It appears from hence, that he was born at <HI>Mal∣ton</HI> in <HI>Lincolnshire.</HI>" And why not at Malton in <HI>Yorkshire?</HI> or why, indeed, at any <HI>Malton?</HI> There are still places called <HI>Melton.</HI> But do you suppose, that when a person is designed <HI>of</HI> such a place, it is always an evidence he was <HI>born</HI> at it?</P>
<P>P. 79.</P>
<P>"<HI>Vuel</HI> thing;" "well, good." P. 82. "<HI>Vuel</HI> thing;" "Vile."</P>
<P>Such sensible people, Mr. Warton, as yourself, generally take care to be very consistent. Is a <HI>good</HI> thing a <HI>vile</HI> one?</P>
<P>P. 110.</P>
<P>"Before these expeditions into the East became fashionable, the prin∣cipal and leading subjects of the old fablers were the atchievements of king
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>Arthur with his knights of the round table, and of Charlemagne with his twelve peers. But in the romances written after the holy war, a new set of champions, of conquests and of countries, were introduced. Trebizonde took place of Rouncevalles, and Godfrey of Bulloigne, Solyman, Nouraddin, the caliphs, the souldans, and the cities of Aegypt and Syria, became the favourite topics."</P>
<P>And now, Mr. Warton, after this very sublime Eastern flight, let me ask, for I dare say many of your readers would be glad to know, what time you are pleased to call the fashionable aera of the Crusade. Was it when Godfrey cap∣tured Jerusalem in 1099? or when Richard I. planted the English standard upon the walls of Acon in 1191? If the first, you will, I am afrayed, be at a loss to produce a single romance upon the subject of king Arthur, of Charlemagne, or of Roncesvalles. If the second, then I am to enquire where a romance is to be found, any way near that age, or, indeed, of any other, which treats of Tre∣bizond, independent of the history of Charlemagne? and, excepting, perhaps, a book or two of the acts of Godfrey and Baldwin, where are these favourite romances of Solyman, Nouraddin, the caliphs, the soldans, Egypt, and Syria, which cut such a pompous figure in the above extract? Shall I like∣wise give you the trouble to recollect your authority for making the whole body of the troubadours of Provence take up arms, and follow their barons, "in prodigious multitudes," to the conquest of Jerusalem? That some few of these poets, in the service and courts of princes, should be permitted to accom∣pany their lords to the crusade, and that others, of inferior rank, might enter into and mix with the army, may be, and I fancy is, very true: but that a single province should, at that or any other time, contain such <HI>prodigious multitudes</HI> of itinerant minstrels, is an assertion as hypothetic and insupportable, as it is in∣credible and absurd. It will, moreover, appear, that the Provencal troubadours were then (<HI>i. e.</HI> about the latter crusade, for you fix upon neither) and for some time after, a respectable and superior description of men.</P>
<P>P. 111.</P>
<P>"The elder Spanish romances have <HI>professedly</HI> more Arabian allusions than any other."—Will you, Mr. Warton, do us the favour to name a single one of those elder Spanish romances, with <HI>any</HI> Arabian allusion? I know you cannot. Cervantes has, indeed, pretended that the author of Don Quixote was an Arabian. And any person acquainted with the romantic books pub∣lished about his own time <NOTE N="(11)" PLACE="foot">Historia de Don Rodrigo, 1592, 1600, 4 to. Historia de las guerras civiles de Granada, 1604, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> will see the force and propriety of this piece of satyre. Those critics, and we know well enough who they are, that supposed Spain to have learned the art of romance-writing from the Arabians, and to have afterwards communicated it to the rest of Europe, were, unfortunately, ignorant that this species of composition was every where cultivated, and had been so for centuries, before it is known to have even existed in Spain. To prove that the Spaniards imitated the Moors (and they have not a single ro∣mance
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>(at least what WE mean by romance) to be given in evidence upon the occasion) it should first be made appear, from better authority than the whim∣sical reveries of self-conceited hypothetics, that those Arabians had any such performances among them. Huet does <HI>not</HI> seem to favour any such system: he uses the word <HI>romance</HI> with the greatest propriety: and the <HI>sophistry</HI> and <HI>ig∣norance</HI> of that (would-have-been) universal critic (and there was never wanting either a fool to think, or a parasite to call him so) who undertook and pre∣tended to correct him, has been sufficiently <HI>exposed</HI> and <HI>chastised</HI> by one very well acquainted with the merits of both <NOTE N="(12)" PLACE="foot">Supplement to Shakspeare, i. 373.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>P. 165.</P>
<P>The Sowdan of Damascus is represented in the text as riding with great violence to attack king Richard; and the romance says,
<Q><L>"A FAUCON BRODE in honde he bare,</L>
<L>"For he thought he wold thare</L>
<L>"Have slayne Rycharde with treasowne."</L></Q>
This <HI>faucon brode</HI> you most sagaciously interpret to be a BIRD! wonderful ge∣nius!—What had not the king to dread from an enemy so terribly accoutered! "The Soldan (continues this your admirable exposition) is represented as meet∣ing Richard with a <HI>hawk</HI> on his fist, to shew indifference, or a <HI>contempt for his adversary;</HI> and that he came rather prepared for the CHACE than the COMBAT." And so you go on, through a whole page, and a long note, to prove that other great men formerly carryed hawks on their fist, but <HI>never,</HI> as you very ingeniously conclude, <HI>going to battle:</HI> and yet the Soldan is here in the midst of an engage∣ment, and riding full speed to assail his antagonist, with a FAULCON in (not <HI>on</HI>) his hand, instead of a SABRE!—Though such unparalleled ignorance, such matchless effrontery, is not, Mr. Warton, in my humble opinion, worthy of any thing but castigation or contempt, yet, should there be a single person, beside yourself, who can mistake the meaning of so plain, so obvious a passage (which I much suspect to have been corrupted in coming through your hands) I shall beg leave to inform him, that a FAUCON BRODE is nothing more or less than a BROAD FAUCHION.</P>
<P>P. 188.</P>
<P>"With ffoxes tails mony aboute."</P>
<P>"In many knots." Clearly, with many foxes tails about him.</P>
<P>P. 189.</P>
<P>I stop here to acquaint you, that ROBERT LE DIABLE is a <HI>totally different personage</HI> from ROBERT OF CICYLE. I shall have a little more to say to you on your intimacy with these two gentlemen by and by.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="12"/>P. 198.</P>
<P>Pray, Mr. Warton, shall I take the liberty to ask you, in what "RO∣MANTIC HISTORY OF THE PALADINS" we shall find "William Ferra∣bras and his brethren, sons of Tancred the Norman, [who] acquired the signories of Apulia and Calabria, about the year 1230!"</P>
<P>P. 200.</P>
<P>"It is well known that <HI>anciently</HI> England LADIES were <HI>sheriffs</HI> of <HI>coun∣ties.</HI>" This is a circumstance of which you, who seem to know so many strange things, may be perfectly satisfyed. Some of your readers, though, I imagine, would have been equally obliged to you, if you had condescended to produce an instance or two of the fact:—but that, I am afrayed, would have been somewhat difficult to compass <NOTE N="(13)" PLACE="foot">The hereditary sheriffdom of Westmoreland has been, and may still be, in a female: and to this, though it be nothing to the purpose, you may, perhaps, mean to allude.</NOTE></P>
<P>P. 205.</P>
<P>"The metrical romance, entitled, La [Le] Mort Arthure…is supposed by the learned and accurate Wanley to be a translation from the French: who adds, that it is not perhaps older than the times of Henry the seventh. But as it abounds with many Saxon words, and SEEMS to be quoted in Syr Bevys, I have given it a place here <NOTE N="(14)" PLACE="foot">That is, before or about the time of king Edward II.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>The learning and accuracy of Mr. Wanley had not, however, it should seem, the power to convince you that a poem no older than the reign of Henry VII. could not possibly belong to that of Edward II. But it often, indeed, suits ones purpose best to be ignorant. Mr. Wanley says, the writer of this romance "useth many Saxon or obsolete words:" and Dr. Percy observes, that <Q>it SEEMS to be quoted in Syr Bevis,</Q> (your own expression!) which is as un∣likely as it is untrue. However, to settle all differences upon the subject (and you had certainly, Mr. Warton, on these puzzling occasions, better suffer your∣self to be guided by so good a judge as Mr. Wanley, than, being blind your∣selt, lead your blind readers into the ditch) I can assure you, that this same romance (and one might have almost guessed it by the title) is neither more nor less than a good part of CAXTONS <HI>Prose Book</HI> reduced into metre; and neither is, nor possibly can be, older than the reign of Henry the seventh.</P>

<P>"Chaucer mentions in Sir Topaz, among others, the romantic poems of SIR BLANDAMOURE, Sir Libeaux, and Sir Ippotis. Of the for∣mer, I find nothing more than the name occurring in SIR LIBEAUX." And do you, Mr. Warton, <HI>really</HI> find the name there? Dr. Percy, indeed, says that the word (<HI>Blandamoure,</HI> 1 suppose) occurs in LIBEAUX; and very modestly
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>observes, "that 'tis possible Chaucers memory deceived him!" But you, Mr. Warton, will be pleased to mark: 1. that Chaucer does NOT mention SIR BLANDAMOURE (the <HI>title</HI> is conferred by yourself <NOTE N="(15)" PLACE="foot">You have, on this occasion, I see, been very liberal of your knightly favours:—having bestowed the same honour upon poor master <HI>Ypotis.</HI> It would not be amiss to christen it—the <HI>Order of Ignorance.</HI></NOTE>); he onely names Syr Libeaus and <HI>Pleindamoure.</HI> And, 2. I am credibly informed, that no such name as either Blandamoure or Pleindamoure is to be found in Lybeaus: so that, it is probable, either your own eyes, or (as I rather suppose) those of your right reverend and learned friend, have seen the thing which was not.</P>
<P>"Among Tanners manuscripts (you say) we have the <HI>Weddynge of Sir Gawain,</HI> Numb. 455. Bibl. Bodl." But are you sure, Mr. Warton, that this reference is accurate:—there was, I am well assured, no such thing in the article when it was, not long since, inspected for this very purpose.</P>

<P>"Fitz-Stephen mentions, at the end of his tract, "Imperatricem Ma∣tildem, Henricum tertium, et beatum Thomam. &amp;c." p. 483." Upon which you make the following profound and sagacious remark: "Henry the third did not accede till the year 1216. Perhaps he (Fitz-Stephen) implied <HI>futu∣rum</HI> regem tertium." You conclude then, do doubt, that he spoke by the spirit of prophecy; for this Henry the third was not born till 1207, thirty-five years after Beckets assassination, and sometime, most probably, after Fitz-Ste∣phens death.

<PB N="13" REF="15"/>fertile enough, perhaps, in creations of this kind. Why might not Cressid be represented by Chaucer as reading the STORY OF THEBES? Was the destruction of that city subsequent to the siege of Troy? And, admitting that Chaucer de∣rived all his own knowlege from the THEBAID, does CASSANDRA ever mention the name of STATIUS?</P>

He, indeed, speaks of the sword which belonged to "<HI>Amadis, quando se llamàva,</HI> el Cavallero de la ar∣diente espada <NOTE N="(17)" PLACE="foot">P. 1. l. 3. c. 4.</NOTE>," when he called himself, <HI>the Knight of the burning sword:</HI> and, if you had been in the least degree acquainted with the matter, you would have known that it is not to AMADIS DE GAUL, but to AMADIS OF GREECE, he here alludes: which last character is known by this very title; and whose sword had actually the qualities which Cervantes ascribes to it.</P>

<P>It is not very surprising that you should forget what you never knew: but, to assist your memory, I will inform you of three things, no one of which I dare believe you are at present in the least acquainted with.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The romance alluded to by Cervantes is intitled, <HI>"La Historia de la linda Magalona hija del rey de Napoles y de Pierres de Provença,"</HI> printed at Seville, 1533, and 1542, 4 to. and is a translation from a much more ancient and very celebrated French romance, under a similar title.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The story of the wooden horse, with the pin in its head, is also to be found in another old Spanish romance (like∣wise from the French) intitled, <HI>"La Historia del cavallero Clamades y de la linda Clarmonda,"</HI> printed at Burgos, 1521, in 4 to.</ITEM>

<P>"The story of Patient Grisilde was the invention of Boccacio." Hardyly and boldly asserted.—Blind Bayard never hesitates at a leap. From the circumstance of there being every reason to conclude that Boccace was NOT the author of this story, you very rationally conclude he WAS. In the year 1373 (and not 1374) the Decameron fell into the hands of Petrarch, who tells Boccace, in a letter, he was so much affected with this tale, that he had trans∣lated it into Latin; adding, that it had always pleased him <HI>when he had heard
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>it many years before</HI> <NOTE N="(19)" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Tyrwhitts Chaucer, iv. 157.</NOTE>; a sufficient proof that Boccace was not the author. And it would, indeed, appear very strange, if Petrarch had not payed his friend some compliment upon the invention of so interesting a story, if he had not been fully apprised that it was <HI>not</HI> HIS. Besides, it is well enough known that this is far from being the onely tale in the Decameron, of which Boccace was not the in∣ventor. The fable of Chaucers interview with Petrarch having been justly exploded and given up by every other person, YOU are now "inclined to think that he (Chaucer) was one of those friends to whom Petrarch used to relate it (<HI>i. e.</HI> the story of Grisilde) at Padua;" and "this," you say, "seems suf∣ficiently pointed out in the words of the prologue;" because the Clerk of Ox∣enford, who tells the story, there says, that HE "lernid it at 'Padow of <HI>this</HI> worthie clerke." A most convincing and satisfactory circumstance truely! But Petrarch does not inform us that he ever used to relate the story to his friends at Padua, or anywhere else: he onely says, he had shewn his translation of it to one of them: and from this version, which would, most probably, be longer and more circumstantial than Boccacios (and if you think proper, you have it in your power to compare them) there can be little doubt that Chaucer took the story, believing it to be Petrarchs own, and knowing it was not Boccacios.</P>

<P>I will here, with your good leave, transcribe a very curious note from the foot of this page.</P>
<P>"I have mentioned a Latin romance of Alexander's life, as printed by Fre∣derick Corsellis, about 1468. supr. vol. i. p. 131. [where you tell us it is "without date."] On examination, that impression is said to be finished Decemb. 17, 1468. Unluckily, the seventeenth day of December was a Sun∣day that year. A manifest proof that the name of Corsellis was forged."</P>
<P>And upon this correction and inevitable conclusion, I shall beg leave to hazard a couple of insignificant remarks. The first is, I much doubt whe∣ther there be any such book as you refer to, appearing or pretending to be printed by Corsellis in the above year; because, if there be, and we can onely get rid of your "manifest proof," I think its existence will go a great way to establish not onely the identity of the man, but his residence and practice at
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>Oxford in that very early period: a circumstance so much to the credit of Alma Mater, that I am surprised one of her old fostered children should have so readyly given it up, on the slight ground of a printers devil finishing a book upon a Sunday!</P>
<P>But are you <HI>certain,</HI> Mr. Warton, that the 17th day of Decem. 1468 <HI>was</HI> a Sunday? Because I have (and this is my 2d remark) some reason to believe that it was not; and I'll tell you why:—It was a SATURDAY; the last day of the week; the most likely of all others for the finishing of a laborious work: "a manifest proof that the name of Corsellis was NOT forged." For, surely, "the collusion holds good in the exchange."—The Sunday letter for this part of the year, which was leap year (and I appeal to every one capable of calcu∣lating it) was B. Sunday must, therefor, necessaryly fall upon the EIGHTEENTH day of the above month; as any parish-clerk is able to inform you. How prudent, Mr. Warton, you see it is, always to establish your premisses upon a sure foundation, before you venture to draw a conclusion which may, in the end, prove the overthrow of its creator.</P>

<P>The extract from Sir Launfal, for which you are obliged to your very ac∣curate and faithful friend and coadjutor, Dr. Thomas Percy (now lord bishop of Dromore) is in the same miserable state of incorrectness as all your other transcripts from MSS. But why should you regard what you do not under∣stand? I will, 1st, give you an instance that it is incorrect; and, 2dly, an instance that you do not understand it.</P>
<P N="1">1. Instead of "<HI>Le</HI> douʒty artours dawes," the MS. reads "<HI>Be</HI> (i. e. <HI>by,</HI> in) douʒty artours dawes."</P>
<P N="2">2. "Of a <HI>ley</HI> that was ysette."</P>
<P><HI>Ley</HI> you interpret <HI>Liege;</HI> as if it alluded to Launfals character or situation; whereas it is simply a <HI>Lay</HI> (or song) that was so called.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="19"/>I could adduce five hundred such instances, if I chose. I may hereafter take some notice of your absurd whim of ascribing "a set of French romances" to "some Armorican bard;" as well as of the familiar and confident manner in which you affect to speak of the poets of Britany; of whose writings you never saw a line, nor can you tell where there is one to be found; and for whose history you know not where to look.</P>

<P>I onely observe, that the <HI>Gal,</HI> which you have here so very ingeniously con∣verted into <HI>Sal,</HI> and thence into <HI>Salisbury,</HI> is foisted in by yourself, without the least authority.

<P>"John Major mentions the beginning of some of his [i. e. James I. of Scotlands] other poems, viz. "Yas sen, &amp;c." and "at Beltayn, &amp;c." Both these poems SEEM to be written on his wife." And why do they SEEM so? Did you ever see them?

You must either, Mr. Warton, deal in very strange histories, or else you are very unmindful of what you read, or careless of what you say. And, indeed, I cannot but think, if that good and wholesome disci∣pline, which the name of MILTON may probably call to your remembrance, were still in use at Trinity College, the more than childish ignorance of a certain near friend of yours would hardly escape without experiencing its salutary effects.</P>

<P>If you had looked further into John Hardings Chronicle, than merely to
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>pick out a specimen of his poetical frigidity, you might have found reason to allow, with some truth, "that both his prose and poetry are equally useful;" as his book contains many curious and important historical records, and a relation of numerous interesting facts, in some of which he was a performer, to others an eye-witness, not to be found in any other of our old writers: and, surely, you are not so absurd as to imagine, that the veracity of his narrative is impeached by the flatness of his verse. But, indeed, I am not at all sur∣prised at the disregard you shew for authentic history, after giving us such signal proofs how little you are acquainted with it.</P>
<P>P. 134.</P>
<P>"John Scogan is commonly supposed to have been a cotemporary of Chaucer, but this is a mistake. He was educated at Oriel college in Oxford; and being an excellent mimic, and of great pleasantry in conversation, be∣came the favourite buffoon of the court of Edward the fourth, in which he passed the greatest part of his life." You could scarcely have give the gen∣tleman a more particular description, if you had enjoyed the pleasure of a <HI>tête-à-tête</HI> with him. But where is your authority for it? Marry, in "SCOGGINS JESTS;" an admirable source, truely, to draw the history of a mans life from. So may the lives of Foote, Garrick, and Sir John Fielding, be compiled, by some future Warton, from the jest-books extant under their re∣spective names. But let us examine the account. This Scogan, or Scoggin, it seems was a buffoon in the court of Edward the fourth: how, then, came Falstaff to break his head, "at the court gate, when he was a crack not thus high;" this was in John of Gaunts time, when Jack "was page to Thomas Mowbray, duke of Norfolk <NOTE N="(22)" PLACE="foot">2d pt. of Hen. IV. a. iii. sc. 1.</NOTE>" O! this no doubt, you will say, is Shak∣speares own anachronism. Ben Jonson, however, who was as likely to know the fact as you are, expressly tells us that Scogan was
<Q><L>— a fine gentleman, and a master of arts</L>
<L>Of HENRY THE FOURTHS times, that made disguises</L>
<L>For the kings sons, and writ in ballad royal</L>
<L>Daintily well <NOTE N="(23)" PLACE="foot">Fortunate Isles, vol. vi. p. 292. Consult also Tyrwhitts Chaucer, V. xv. xix.</NOTE>.</L></Q>
And this seems to be true; for we have a <HI>moral balade royal</HI> from "Scogan, unto the lordes and gentlemen of the kynges house," and which must, as you observe, have been written before the year 1447 (meaning, I suppose, 1412) in his old age, and printed, as you yourself tell us, by Caxton, who was, doubtless, sufficiently acquainted with his identity and character; and there is, likewise, another from Chaucer to him. So that, notwithstanding any doubt or uncer∣tainty
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>you may have upon the authenticity of these two poems <NOTE N="(24)" PLACE="foot"><P>If the above MORAL BALADE be "the dullest sermon that ever was written," and if it, and other things equally dull, be the whole of Scogans poetical remains, whence arises your authority for giving him the very familiar appellation of "our JOCULAR BARD?" since, by your own account, his <HI>jests</HI> and his <HI>poetry</HI> had not the remotest connection. It is not unlikely, however, (to allow you all possible justice) that, in thus summing up his character in two words, you had your eye upon the following ingenious composition, which he wrote at Oxford, on taking his degree of A. M. and wherein <HI>both</HI> his talents are united.</P>
<Q><L>"A Master of Art is not worth a fart,</L>
<L>"Except he be in schools;</L>
<L>"A Batchelour of Law is not worth a straw,</L>
<L>"Except he be among fools."</L></Q></NOTE>, every person else must be convinced that the Scogan, by and to whom they were re∣spectively written, could not possibly be a <HI>buffoon</HI> in the court of <HI>Edward IV.</HI> This was a difficulty you could not reconcile to your hypothesis: you were, therefor, resolved to deny, or, at least, to doubt, the evidence that made for the opposite side of the question, and to cut the knot which you could not untye. For a little enquiry or attention must have informed you, that the true name of the poet Scogan was HENRY, and not JOHN. This Mr. Tyrwhitt has clearly shewn, and thence (perhaps rather too hastyly) inferred that the story of Scogan the jester was an absurd and improbable fiction; nay, he has even (contrary to his usual candour) gone so far as to call the jest-book, of which you have so exalted an opinion, "a collection of <HI>foolish</HI> stories." The merits of the work I shall leave to be settled between yourselves; but this really learned and ingenious gentleman will not, I trust, take it amiss, if I shall venture to assert, that there <HI>actually was</HI> such a person as JOHN SCOGAN; a totally distinct character from Henry, the poet; and who, though no "jocular bard," (unless you will allow the extract in the note sufficient to authorise the title) must, in my mind, have been "a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy." I do not, in forming this opinion, rely altogether upon your friend Dr. Andrew Borde; though it will appear, that the account given by him is not entirely void of probability <NOTE N="(25)" PLACE="foot">This writer informs us, he had "heard say, that Scogin did come of an honest stock, no kindred, and that his friends did set him to schoole at Oxford, where he did continue till he was made master of art." He appears, from the book, to have been dead before Henry the sevenths time. He is there frequently called TOM, by Sir William Nevyle, and is introduced to court as his fool: possibly, however, this might have been the common appellation of such characters: we still say TOM FOOL. SCOGGINS JESTS, n.d. 4 to. b. 1.</NOTE>; neither do I lay much stress on what Shallow says in 2 Hen. IV.—"Bale, inaccurately," you say (but why, inaccurately? he cer∣tainly knew more about the fellow than you can do) "calls Scogan, the JOCU∣LATOR of Edward the fourth;"—the kings JESTER: there is no inaccuracy in the phrase, and you admit the fact. But I shall produce still better and more unexceptionable authority: and, first, we will see what master Raphael Hol∣linshed says of him (speaking of the great men of Edward the fourths time). "Skogan, a learned gentleman, and student for a time in Oxforde, of a pleasaunte witte, and bent to mery deuises, in respect whereof he was called
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>into the courte, where giuing himselfe to his naturall inclination of mirthe and pleasaunt pastime, he plaied many sporting parts, althoughe not in suche vn∣ciuill maner as hath bene of hym reported <NOTE N="(26)" PLACE="foot"><P>His.

<P>"That time that Scogin was conversant, both in the kings chamber, and in the quens, Scogin would peak here and there, about in the queens chamber or lodging; the queen by custom (as most commonly all great women and ladies and gentlewomen do) let a fart, saying. The same is worth to me twenty pound. Scogin hearing this, girt out a fart like a horse or mare, say∣ing, if that fart be so dear, of twenty pound, my fart is worth forty pounds." (p. 23.)</P>
<P>The story immediately preceding, "How Scogin played horse-play in the queens chamber," is still more "vnciuill."</P>
<P>The title of the book is, "Scogins Jests: Full of witty mirth, and pleasant shifts; done by him in France, and other places. Being a preservative against melancholy. Gathered by Andrew. Board, doctor of physick."</P>
<P>Amongst these ancient and vulgar pleasantries is the (supposedly modern) story of the French quack, and his flea-powder, and Smollets tale of the <HI>three black crows</HI> (here augmented to <HI>twenty-one</HI>). There is likewise the joke of the Oxford scholars proving two eggs to be three; and that of the sharpers convincing the fellow that his sheep were hogs: besides many other such-like things, usually met with in more modern books.</P></NOTE>." Secondly, here is his EPITAPH, transcribed from an authentic MS. in the British Museum <NOTE N="(27)" PLACE="foot">MSS. Harl. 1587. It is remarkable for containing the name of Cardinal Pole, written by himself, when a boy at school.</NOTE>, an evidence which must be decisive as to his existence, character, and christian name:

<P>This MS. appears to have been written towards the latter part of Edward the fourth's time; so that you are peculiarly happy in your conjecture, that Scogan "FLOURISHED about the year 1480 <NOTE N="(28)" PLACE="foot">I could never conceive, Mr. Warton, to what Drayton alludes, in the preface to his Eclogues, where he says, that "the Colin Clout of SCOGAN, under Henry the seventh, is pretty."

<P>"I refer also the NOTBROWNE MAYDE to this period (<HI>i. e.</HI> the reign of Ed. IV.) That is, because you know no better than Prior did, when he called it <HI>three hundred years old.</HI> It cannot possibly be earlyer than Henry the eighths time. You are equally mistaken about "the delectable history of king Ed∣ward the fourth and the tanner of Tamworth," which (as we have it now) is certainly not older than the latter part of queen Elizabeths reign. By a parity of reasoning, I suppose, if it had been <HI>the delectable history of king</HI> HENRY <HI>the fourth, or king Edward the</HI> FIRST, <HI>and the aforesay'd tanner,</HI> you would have car∣ryed it fifty or a hundred years still further back. I readyly, however, admit,
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>that the poem has been much modernised, and that the original (of which, I am certain, you never before heard) is probably as old as the time you mention, having seen and transcribed an ancient MS. copy, which appeared to have been written in or about the reign of Henry the seventh, intitled, "THE KYNG AND THE BARKER <NOTE N="(29)" PLACE="foot"><HI>i. e.</HI> of "Dantre," or Daventry, and not Tamworth.</NOTE>."</P>

<P>Though I very willingly agree with you in determining the poems of Rowley to be modern ill-contrived forgeries, yet I must beg leave to think, that neither "MS. Wantn." nor any other, gives you the least authority for saying, that "SIR CHARLES BALDWIN was executed at Bristol in the presence of Edward the fourth, in the year 1463." This name and circumstance (if not from Chattertons poem) are entirely of your own invention. And how is it possible that ROWLEYS MEMOIRS should be composed in 1460, when he speaks of king Edward IV. as the reigning prince, who did not attain the crown till the following year; and expressly mentions his Bristow tragedy: the relation of an event which, according to your own account, did not happen before 1463 (or, as you afterwards correct yourself, 1462 or 1461)?</P>

<P>Having displayed your ingenious conjectures, that Ranulph Higden, the chronicler, was author of the Chester Whitsun Plays, you tell us, that "in <HI>Piers Plowman,</HI> a FRIER says, that he is <HI>well acquainted</HI> with <HI>the rimes</HI> of Ran∣dall of Chester;" and add, "I take this passage to allude to THIS VERY PER∣SON,
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>and to his <HI>compositions of this kind,</HI> for which he was probably soon famous." Very well; every thing, you suppose, is so far smooth and safe. And now, Mr. Warton, let me observe two things to you: 1st. The fellow, in Piers Plowman, to whom you mean to refer, is NOT a FRIER, but an idle, drunken, SECULAR PRIEST. 2dly. He does NOT say, that he is well acquainted with THE "rimes of Randall of Chester;" he onely tells us, that he "CAN rimes of Roben Hode and Randal of Chester." <HI>i. e.</HI> that he could SING or REPEAT rimes or songs (not MADE BY, but) OF AND CONCERNING Robin Hood and Randal of Chester;—not Randal Hygden, but Randal Blundeville, EARL of CHESTER, a crusader and celebrated hero, greatly in favour with the common people, and contemporary with Robin Hood. You begin now to perceive what a ridiculous figure your conclusion cuts, and into what a miserable dilemma you have got: for, unless you will allow that YOUR <HI>frier</HI> could spout plays written by Robin Hood, you cannot be permitted to say, that he alludes to the Whitsun Mummeries of Randal Hygden, how famous soever you may suppose him to have been on that account.</P>

<P>"The HISTORY OF THE SEVEN CHAMPIONS, a book compiled in the reign of JAMES THE FIRST, by one Richard Johnson, and containing some of the capital fictions of the old Arabian romance." It is somewhat extraordinary, if this work were written no sooner, that the AUTHOR of the OBSERVATIONS ON SPENSERS FAIRY QUEEN should have represented it as one of those "miraculous books" which were so highly fashionable in the reign of queen Elizabeth, and even as having been of great assistance to Spenser in the formation of that poem. But I well know who corrected him; and I likewise believe that <HI>the correcter</HI> knew very little more of the matter than <HI>the corrected.</HI> The fact is, that both the author of the Observations and the author of the History of English Poetry <HI>is</HI> wrong. For, 1st. The History of the Seven Champions was not written so early as the Fairy Queen: and, 2dly. It was not "compiled in the reign of James the first." The first position is not, indeed, quite so easy to prove, nor, as you yourself here suppose the contrary, do I much care whether it be true or not: but the other is certain, "The Seven Champions of Christendom" being quoted, as a popular book, by Meres, in his WITS TREASURY, printed in 1598. With respect to its containing any fiction of Arabian romance, you should, I think, first adduce some such romance, containing similar fictions with the Seven Champions, which is a mere olio from Guy, Bevis, and other old Eng∣lish romances and story-books.</P>

<P>"About the year 1512, MARTIN COCCCAIE of Mantua, whose true name was THEOPHILO FOLENGIO, a Benedictine monk of Casino in Italy, wrote a—burlesque Latin poem, in heroic metre, checquered with ITALIAN and TUSCAN words." This is, surely, the most curious passage that was ever yet found in a history! Any other person than yourself would have na∣turally supposed that a non-existent character could not have written a book; and, if he had sayed any thing, would have told his readers that such a one, under such an assumed name, did so and so. But it seems to be your chief study (if you study at all) to court absurdity, rather than to avoid it: Here being no less than three choice blunders in little more than so many lines. For, in the first place, the assumed name of the aobve writer not MARTIN, but MERLIN, Coccaie. 2dly. His true one was not <HI>Theophilo</HI> FOLENGIO, but
<PB N="26" REF="28"/><HI>Teofilo</HI> FOLENGO. And 3dly.

<P>"To some part of the reign of Henry the eighth I assign the Tournament of Tottenham…the substance of its phraseology, which I diverst of its obvious innovations, is not altogether obsolete enough for a higher period. I am aware, that in a manuscript of the British Museum it is referred to the time of Henry the sixth. But that manuscript affords no positive indication of that date."</P>
<P>Such a shuffleing, nonsensical paragraph was, I firmly believe, never put together since the invention of letters. That which I do not, and which, I think, no one can, understand, I shall not meddle with. Here is an authen∣tic MS. which not onely Mr. Tyrwhitt (and when I mention him I suppose I need not care if there be a hundred of a different opinion) but every other person who has seen it, is satisfyed and convinced could not have been written later than the reign of Henry the sixth. NOW YOU, Mr. Warton, who, to be sure, must be an incomparable judge of what you never saw, pronounce it near a century more modern, because, forsooth, it only <HI>refers</HI> the poem to
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>that age (which it certainly does not) and gives no "positive indication" of such a date (which it certainly does). But if the book had been evidently written in Edward the seconds time, the same absuid plea would have served you. There is not one MS. out of a hundred that has any "positive indi∣cation" of the particular period in which it has been written; and yet people who are in the practice of inspecting and comparing MSS. of different ages, can assign to each its proper date, nearly as well as it they had sound it in the book. But what is all this to you, who know nothing either of ancient writing or of ancient language? For I will venture to say, that the stile of this very composition bespeaks it at least a hundred years older than the <HI>Nut∣browne Mayde,</HI> which, not onely without, but against, all authority, you have thrown so far back as the reign of Henry VI. Your recantation proves no∣thing but your ignorance <NOTE N="(38)" PLACE="foot">The right revd. the lord bp. of Dromore has, in the third edition of his "Reliques of Ancient English Poetry," (vol. ii. p. 13.) printed the TURNAMENT OF TOTTENHAM from the above MS. This copy I naturally suppose you have not seen; or you must, I think, have perceived the absurdity of mentioning "obvious innovations." His lordship has indeed told us, that the <HI>last stanza</HI> is not in the MS. but in this he is positively mistaken.</NOTE></P>

<P>For the purpose of observing that the <HI>stanza</HI> used by <HI>one man</HI> is the same with that used by <HI>another</HI> (a most prosound and important remark, and ex∣tremely necessary, especially in this place!) there was, surely, no occasion to foist in a poem of sixteen stanzas.

How well you kept your word will appear by the volume itsself, which was not published till near three years after, and in which the subject is not even carried down (as you call it) to the commencement of the LAST.</NOTE>. It is, in my opinion, a most extraordinary, and, I hope and believe, unparalleled circumstance, that a man of eminence in the literary
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>world should, in order to enhance the bulk and price of his writings, hazard his reputation upon, and descend to, or rather be guilty of, such low, such paltry, such dishonourable, and even dishonest artifices, as almost to deserve the name and punishment of a—SWINDLER.</P>

<P>"For the purpose of ascertaining or illustrating the age of pieces which have been lately, or will be soon produced, I here stop to recall the readers attention to the poetry and language of the last (<HI>sci.</HI> the 15th) century, by exhibiting some extracts from the manuscript romance of YWAIN and GAWAIN, which has some great outlines of Gothic painting, and appears to have been written in the reign of HENRY THE SIXTH. I premise, that <HI>but few circum∣stances happened, which contributed to the improvement of our language, within</HI> THAT <HI>and the</HI> PRESENT PERIOD."</P>
<P>How modest! how ingenuous!—But, indeed, I ought to apologise for this and the other long extracts I have taken the liberty of producing from your celebrated history; however, as the mode has been adopted, rather for the sake of giving you fair play, and doing you SUBSTANTIAL JUSTICE, than with a view to injure the rapid sale of the work, you will, I flatter myself, have no inclination to be displeased at it. But, to return:—And so you really thought it necessary to go back a full hundred years to <HI>new-write</HI> the History of English Poetry during that period. A most systematical historian, doubt∣less! What would any of Mr. Humes readers have thought of him, if in the middle of Henry the eighths reign he had <HI>stopped to recall their attention</HI> to a new history of the reign of Henry the sixth? What could there possibly be in the state of our language and poetry, at the period you had got to, which could require, could authorise, could justify, or even excuse, your going back a hundred years to begin your story anew? That which you affect "to pre∣mise," with respect to the language having received no improvement between the two periods, is a glaring inconsistency. You wilfully forget, as you wish your readers to do, that there has been a SURREY and a WYATT just men∣tioned. If any other person had advanced such a groundless and absurd po∣sition, you must have taken him for either a fool or a madman. But the truth, Mr. Warton, the truth is, that you knew nothing of this romance when you might properly enough have introduced it, (not in the reign of Henry VI. for that is an age it does not belong to;) you were as entirely ig∣norant of the existence of such a poet as <HI>Laurence Minot,</HI> before you saw Mr. Tyrwhitts Chaucer (which, by the way, was published soon enough for you to have made a better use of it <NOTE N="(40)" PLACE="foot">It appeared three years before the publication of your second volume: in the body of which it is, I believe, never once mentioned.</NOTE>, as you still are of his marit. I know that these communications were made to you after the publication of your second volume; but you were resolved, it seems, to drag them, at all events, neck and heels, into your third; and, I am ready to confess, they well answer the purpose for which you introduced them:—they stuff your book! But,
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>now, Mr. Warton, suffer me, if you please, to say a few words to you upon the age of this same MS. COTTON GALB. E. ix. which, by the way, I believe you never saw, and yet I can hardly think any other person could have been so grossly deceived as to suppose it of the age of Henry VI. I will venture to assure you (and I do not care a farthing whether you believe me or not) that the writing of this book is as old, at least, as the time of king Richard the second. But I well know that all the world will be convinced of your want of judgement before you yourself suspect it.</P>

<P>"It is highly probable, that the metrical romances of RICHARD CUER DE LYON, GUY EARL OF WARWICK, and SYR BEVYS OF SOUTHAMPTON, were modernised in this reign (<HI>sci.</HI> that of Hen. VIII.) from more antient and simple narrations." This ingenious conjecture comes, to be sure, with perfect con∣sistency from one who has already produced large extracts from these very poems, as specimens of the composition of Edward the seconds time. But, ingenious as it is, it contains neither probability nor truth. All the above romances are extant in MSS. above 300 years old; and, one of them, at least, (Sir Bevis) excepting the typographical incorrectness of the old printed copy, differs no otherwise from it than in its orthography, and the slight variations inseparable from repeated transcription. The ancient MS. copy of <HI>Richard Cuer de Lion</HI> is as long, at least, as, if not longer than, the old <HI>editions:</HI> but whether the printed copies agree with the MSS. or not, is a matter of very little conse∣quence to your hypothesis. It is a fact, that some MS. copies are so totally different from each other, as not to have two lines in common; being trans∣lations from the French by different hands. This is actually the case with respect to SIR GUY: there are two distinct translations, both very old; one of which is, line for line, the same with the printed copy. But it will not be found that the phraseology or stile is more polished, or the story more am∣plifyed or intricate, in the editions, than they are in the MSS. Simplicity, indeed, is a fault, of which few people will have reason to complain in the perusal of an old metrical romance, let its antiquity be what it may. I shall
<PB N="36" REF="38"/>take the liberty to observe, in passing, that the printed copy of SIR GUY does NOT begin, ITHEN the tyme that God was borne, as you, implicitly following AMES, but, according to your constant practice, concealing the name of your informant, have been pleased to assert <NOTE N="(41)" PLACE="foot">Ames has printed <HI>Ithen</HI> for <HI>Sithen.</HI></NOTE>.

<P>Although you tell us you have seen a fragment of the book whence. "The Carol brynging in the bores head" is taken, yet was I not without very strong suspicions that you were indebted, as well for this same carol, as for the prin∣ters colophon—not to the book itsself, but—to your honest, industrious, use∣ful, and ungratefully requited, friend and assistant, Thomas Hearne, in his notes and spicilege upon William of Newbury, who had likewise, as it appeared, fur∣nished you with the anecdote from Hollinshed (p. 745). These suspicions were not weakened on finding, by a comparison of you and your authority, that sayed carol and colophon were printed with your usual accuracy. But, upon fur∣ther reflection, I am half inclined to question the justice of the above sus∣picions; for it rather seems to me, that you have been, on this occasion, GUILTY OF PRIVATELY STEALING—from YOURSELF. And I'll tell you how. In that very humourous trifle, intitled and called, "A COMPANION TO THE GUIDE, AND A GUIDE TO THE COMPANION," I see that you have inserted the whole of Mr. Hearnes account <HI>verbatim,</HI> and with a circumstance which might, elsewhere, have been more to your honour:—you have given a minute and accurate reference to your real authority. I say <HI>elsewhere;</HI> for it is, in this place, done merely with a view to raise a laugh at the expence of that most worthy and respectable antiquary; whom, I rather think, you have, in the above piece, made somewhat too-many attempts to ridicule; forgetting, perhaps, that though he was less polished in his taste, and less elegant in his diction than some more modern writers, few, if any of them, can boast of such a sacred regard to truth, and of such unimpeached integrity. And what∣ever his errors are, there is one, in which I wish you had imitated him as successfully as you have done in many others of a less important and com∣mendable nature:—he has never been detected in a wilful falsehood; nor been ever charged with the slightest misrepresentation of the minutest fact.</P>
<P>Lest the number and uniformity of these dry expostulations should render them too flat and tedious to yourself, or my other gentle readers, I shall make bold to break the chain, and endeavour to enliven you and them with an old Christmas carol upon bringing up the BOARS HEAD, very different from that printed by Wynken de Worde, and now, for the first time, faithfully published from an ancient MS. in my own possession.</P>

"Pough, fool! it fills my book up, do'n't it?"

Trust me, I admire your modesty, though, doubtless, we shall have more anon. But pray, as you have entertained us with so many Italian quotations, give me leave to ask you, how long it may be since you became master of that language? because I have heared, that, once upon a time, when you were ambitious of displaying your erudition, in the OBSER∣VATIONS ON SPENSERS FAIRY QUEEN, by an extract from Tasso, (—Tasso in the original!—) you unfortunately laid hold of a <HI>wrong stanza,</HI> which occa∣sioned much mirth among those wicked wits, who are so maliciously disposed as not to suffer a man of genius to enjoy the credit of talents and learning which he does not possess.</P>

<P>A great deal has been sayed about Marlow, his opinions and exit, from age to age; from Beard to Warton: the oldest writers ("prejudiced and peevish puritans") directly arraigning him of atheism and blasphemy; and those of more modern times (pious and orthodox churchmen) generously labouring to rescue his character; either by boldly denying, or artfully extenuating the crimes alledged against him: but not an <HI>iota</HI> of evidence has been produced on either side.

<P>From the above curious Confession of Faith it appears, I doubt, but too plain, that these "prejudiced peevish puritans" had sufficient authority to assert, that Marlow" denied God, and his sonne Christ, and nor onely in word blasphemed the Trinity, but also (as 'was' credibly reported) wrote bookes against it, affirming our Sauiour to be but a deceiuer, and Moses to be but a coniurer and seducer of the people, and the holy Bible to bee but vaine and idle stories, and all religion but a deuice of policie <NOTE N="(50)" PLACE="foot">Beards Theatre of Gods Judgements, (1631, 4 to.) p. 149.

<P>Your propensity to corruption and falsehood seems so natural, that I have been sometimes tempted to believe, you often substitute a lye in the place of a fact without knowing it. How else you came to tell us that Marlow was stabbed in the BOSOM I cannot conceive. It could not, surely, be for the <HI>smooth∣ness of the paragraph?</HI> All former writers, and Wood, amongst the rest, whom you expressly quote, and (which does not always follow) by a slight pecu∣liarity in your expression, I think you must have consulted, say it was in his HEAD.</P>

<P>"Among Mr. Oldys's books was the "Life of Sir Meliado <HI>a Brittish knight,</HI>" translated from the Italian, in 1572. By the way, we are not here to suppose that BRITTISH means ENGLISH. A BRITTISH knight means a knight of BRETAGNE or BRITANNY, in France. This is a common mistake, arising from an equivocation which has converted many a French knight into an Englishman. The learned Nicholas Antonio, in his SPANISH LIBRARY, <HI>affords a remarkable example of this confusion,</HI> and a <HI>proof of its frequency,</HI> where he is speaking of the Spanish translation of the romance of TIRANTE THE WHITE, in 1480. <Q>Ad fabularum artificem stylum convertimus, Joannem Martorell Valentiae regni civem, cujus est liber hujus commatis, TIRANT LE BLANCH inscriptus, atque anno 1480, ut aiunt, Valentiae in folio editus. <HI>More hic aliorum talium otiosorum consueto,</HI> fingit se librum ex ANGLICA in Lusitanam, deinde Lusitana in Valentinam linguam, anno, 1460, trans∣tulisse,
<PB N="44" REF="46"/>&amp;c.</Q> That is, <Q>I now turn to a writer of fabulous adventures, John Martorell of the kingdom of Valencia, who wrote a book of this cast, entitled TIRANTE the WHITE, printed in folio at Valencia <NOTE N="(51)" PLACE="foot">You cannot even translate the simplest passage with common honesty. Antonio does not assert, that the book was ACTUALLY PRINTED at Valencia in that year; he onely says, IT WAS REPORTED SO: And the report was false.</NOTE> in 1480. This writer, according to a practice common to such idle historians, pretends he translated this book from English into Portugueze, and from thence into the Valencian language.</Q> The hero is a <HI>gentleman</HI> of BRE∣TAGNE, and the book was FIRST WRITTEN IN THE LANGUAGE OF THAT COUNTRY. I take this opportunity of observing, that <HI>these mistakes</HI> of ENG∣LAND for BRITANNY, <HI>tend to confirm</HI> MY HYPOTHESIS, that Bretagne, or Ar∣morica, was antiently a copious source of romance: an hypothesis, which I have the happiness to find was the opinion of the most learned and ingenious M. La Croze. <HI>&amp;c.</HI>—(p. 447.) "OUR KING ARTHUR was sometimes called ARTHUR of LITTLE BRITTAYNE, and there is a romance with that title, re∣printed in 1609."</P>
<P>I trouble you, Mr. Warton, with this long extract, because it is so very in∣teresting, and I have such a great deal to say to you upon it, that nothing less, perhaps, would have answered either your purpose or mine.</P>
<P>Though I never met with the "LIFE OF SIR MELIADO," nor with any other notice of it, I must be content to suppose it to have actually been where you say it was. But you ought, certainly, to have been better acquainted with it before you had so peremptoryly decided upon the meaning of the word "BRITTISH," which, with equal absurdity and presumption, you would con∣fine to BRETAGNE or Britany in France. To be sure, you are rather got into your Irish stile when you attempt to prove that BRITISH does NOT mean ENG∣LISH, as no one, I believe, excepting yourself, could possibly have imagined that it did. It is, at the same time, very curious, to find a person, who either is, or pretends to be, a scholar, hardyly contending that this country was never called BRITAIN, nor its inhabitants BRITISH! That the sun gives no light, and the night brings no darknes! The notion is, in the utmost degree, con∣temptible and absurd. Armorica was by the French called LA PETITE BRE∣TAGNE, by us, LITTLE BRITAIN, merely to distinguish it from the iland of GREAT BRITAIN, by the stiled LA GRANDE BRETAGNE. The name BRITISH <HI>may,</HI> for aught I know, be common to both countries, but I firmly believe the inhabitants of BRITANY were never so called, much less <HI>distinguished,</HI> by any writer, English of foreign, before the sagacious Mr. Warton <NOTE N="(52)" PLACE="foot">If there be any such book as "The Life of Sir Meliado," it is, without doubt, the romance of MELIADUS DE LEONNOIS, a petty king in GREAT BRITAIN, and one of the knights of the Round Table; whose story was translated out of French into Italian, and printed at Venice in 1558 and 1559, in two volumes octavo.</NOTE>. But, let the word BRITISH mean what it will, how does it connect with or apply to the quotation from Nicholas Antonio? He says nothing at all about BRITISH; he expresly tells us, that Martorell pretended to have translated the romance of Tirante, "EX ANGLICA," out of ENGLISH. I have not, in the whole
<PB N="45" REF="47"/>course of this strange history, been astonished at any-thing more than at your assertion that "the hero is a gentleman of BRETAGNE." Because I can onely conclude it to be a guess; and it happens to be as lucky as it was bold. You are not quite so fortunate, however, in your equally dog∣matical position, that "the book was FIRST WRITTEN IN THE LANGUAGE OF THAT COUNTRY:" than which nothing can be more insupportable, more ill-grounded, or more false. I must, indeed, confess, that it was not without reason you concluded every one to be as ignorant about the mat∣ter as yourself; and that you might safely advance whatever you chose without the smallest fear of detection. But, alas! how miserably have you been deceived! John or Joanot Martorell, the author of the above romance of TIRANT LO BLANCH (which, by the way, was not printed at Valencia in 1480, but at Barcelona in 1497, and no where else during the 15th century) in his dedication thereof to Don Ferdinand, prince of Portugal, and duke of Viseo, brother of Alphonsus V. and then (<HI>sci.</HI> in 1460) presumptive heir to the crown, to which his son Emanuel afterwards succeeded, po∣sitively declares, that the history and acts of the said TIRANT were written in the English tongue, <HI>"EN LENGUA ANGLESA;"</HI> that he had TRANSLATED them out of THAT LANGUAGE into PORTUGUESE, at the direct instance of the above prince, who thought, that, as he (Martorell) had been sometime in England, "<HI>EN LA ILLA DE ANGLETERRA</HI> <NOTE N="(53)" PLACE="foot">In the suite, perhaps, of Peter duke of Coimbra, one of the sons of John I. who was here in the third year of king Henry VI. (1425) at whose court he was magnificently enter∣tained, and made a knight of the Garter: An honour which Martorell has conferred upon the hero of his romance, whom he supposes to be the first that received it. As to prince Ferdi∣nand, though he might never be in England, it is not improbable that he understood some∣thing of the language; being grandson of Philippa, sister of our Henry IV. and wife of the above John. He dyed in 1471, aged thirty; so that he could not well have been more than nineteen when he imposed the task of this translation upon Martorell.</NOTE>, he would know the tongue better than others; that he had since translated the book out of Portuguese into his native dialect the VALENCIAN <NOTE N="(54)" PLACE="foot">He onely lived, it appears, to finish the three first books; the fourth and last part is sayed to be translated <HI>"a pregaries de la noble senyora dona ysabel de loriç, per lo magnifich caualler mossen marti iohau de galba."</HI></NOTE>; and apologises for the defects of his version, as being in some measure occasioned by the peculiar difficulties of the English language, which he had, in many places, found it impracticable to translate. But, as you appear to understand Valencian <NOTE N="(55)" PLACE="foot">See before, p. 30.</NOTE>, I shall give you his own words: <HI>"Car si d'faliments algūs hi son certament senyor nes en part causa da dita LENGUA ĀGLESA de la qual en algunes partides es inpossible poder be girar los vocables."</HI> It is strange enough, that an author, more espe∣cially of Martorells consequence, who is stiled <HI>"lo magnifich e virtuos ca∣valler,"</HI> should have the considence to impose upon his patron not onely a feigned original, but a feigned command to translate it, and an imaginary translation too. This is an enigma we cannot at present solve. It is not impos∣sible, however, that Martorell might actually pick up some part of his sub∣ject during his residence in England. What makes this conjecture the less
<PB N="46" REF="48"/>improbable is the use he has made of the story of <HI>"Comte gillem de uaroych",</HI> (Guy of Warwick) which we know to have been then extant in English. The origin of THE GARTER, the magnificent celebration of the nuptials of the king of England (alluding, most likely, to those of Richard II.) with the king of France's daughter, and some few other particulars, he may, undoubtedly, have got here: Though one might, perhaps, be led to think that he has derived his principal information on these heads from old Froissart, a favourite historian during the continuance of chivalry. But, independent of his own assertions, the venial deceits of a romantic age, there is the strongest and most conclusive evidence, as well intrinsic as extrinsic, that Martorell, whether he wrote first in Portuguese or Valencian, was the original author. As to the work itself, it is a most ingenious and admirable performance, well deserving the praises bestowed upon it by Cervantes <NOTE N="(56)" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Don Quixote,</HI> p. 1. l. 1. c: 6. The romance of Tirante was, early in the 16th century, translated into Castilian; from thence into Italian, and about 30 or 40 years ago into French. The two latter translators were entire strangers to the original, of which there is not, perhaps, more than one single copy known to be extant.</NOTE>, and much beyond any thing of the kind ever pro∣duced in England, or even (if one dare venture to say it) capable of being so.</P>
<P>You will not desire me to take further notice of your assertion, that this romance was first written in the language of Britany. I have, I think, sayed enough to make you completely ashamed of yourself, if you have a particle of modesty in your composition. But what credit, let me ask, is a reader to place in the reveries and confident declarations of so ignorant, so false, and so conceited a writer?</P>
<P>Your HYPOTHESIS, as you call it, is so false, so groundless, so visionary, and absurd, that I am equally willing to believe it your own, and to leave you in peacable possession of it. Neither have I any thing, at present, to say to "the most learned and ingenious M. La Croze;" of whom I must with shame acknowlege, I never before heared: If, therefor, it be such an amazing happyness to find one single person in the whole world of the same opinion with yourself, enjoy it.</P>
<P>That "our king Arthur" might be "sometimes called Arthur of Little: Brittayne," as he is supposed to have been king of both countries, is pro∣bable enough, though I do not believe it. I am, however, ready to allow that "there is a romance with that title," which may, for any thing I know to the contrary, have been "reprinted in 1609." But they who told you that should, at the same time, have informed you that Arthur of Little Britain, the hero of that romance, is a very different person from king Arthur of Great Britain. And so much for you, and your hypothesis.</P>

<P>The old version of TASSO, being registered by Ames, and at present exist∣ing, to my knowlege, in more libraries than one, is no such mighty discovery as you seem to flatter yourself.

<P>I have at length, Mr. Warton, completed my design of exposing to the public eye a tolerable specimen of the numerous errors, falsities, and plagia∣risms, of which you have been guilty in the course of your celebrated History. And, though I am conscious of having left considerable gleanings to any who may be inclined to follow me, I trust I have given you much reason to be sorry, and more to be ashamed: But whether my arguments will produce any such effects, I, really, neither know, nor care.</P>
<P>Next to the civil history of a country, an account of its language, literature, and poetry is, both to natives and strangers, the most interesting and important subject that can be conceived. A subject which requires and deserves the greatest talents and most unremiting industry. But this is a task for which you, of all men who have ever pretended to write history, are the least qua∣lifyed. Your language, I confess, is easy and elegant; but your indolence in collecting and examining materials; and, beyond every thing, your igno∣rance of the subject, should have prevented you from engaging in a work of such great and general consequence; in which, whatever might be your progress, how uninformed soever you might esteem the bulk of your readers, you were certain, at last, of encountering detection and disgrace. You have entitled your performance the HISTORY of English Poetry. It is the extreme of <HI>hyperbole,</HI> and a gross insult to common sense! Could you flatter yourself
<PB N="48" REF="50"/>that your <HI>calling</HI> it a HISTORY would induce the public to accept it for one. Alas! what do they perceive, but an injudicious <HI>farrago,</HI> a <HI>gallimawfry</HI> of things which both do and do not belong to the subject, thrown and jumbled together, without system, arrangement, or perspicuity:
<Q><L>—a dark</L>
<L>Illimitable ocean, without bound,</L>
<L>Without dimension, where length, breadth, and highth,</L>
<L>And time and place are lost!</L></Q>
The reader is bewildered in mazes; he turns round and round; and wanders backward and foreward, and foreward and backward, and at last finds his∣self just where he set out, heartyly tired, and without anything to console him for the tediousness and labour of the journey;—unless he can pick a flower or two (for flowers there certainly are) from amongst the numerous weeds and briars which intercept his passage, and entangle his footsteps. Want of method, however, is the least fault of which you can be accused. If your collections had been authentic, though of theirselves no history, nor capable, in your hands, of becoming one, they might at least have been useful to some subsequent writer better qualifyed for the purpose. But we see (as has been here sufficiently proved) you are not to be relyed on in a single in∣stance; the work being a continued tissue of falsehood from beginning to end. Suffer me, as a friend,—to your subject, at least,—to recommend it to you, to take all the advice and assistance you can get from the most able literary characters who may be willing to render you either, and immediately set abous a diligent revisal and correction <NOTE N="(57)" PLACE="foot">I would likewise wish you to be convinced of another fault which ought to be carefully rooted out; I mean your fulsome and disgusting <HI>Egotism.</HI> There is some difference between the <HI>History of English Portry,</HI> and the <HI>Life and Opinions of Thomas Warton.</HI></NOTE> of your three volumes already published, deferring the remainder of the work till it be worthy of the light; do justice to those writers to whom you have been actually indebted; and omit that which is unnecessary, and which you have, from the vilest motive, inserted merely to extend and enlarge the work; even if, by so doing, your three volumes should be reduced to two: That the work may not remain a monu∣ment of disgrace to yourself and your country. Of all men living, the learned and intelligent editor of The CANTERBURY TALES is the best able to afford you the requisite help; and, surely, in a matter of such universal con∣cern, if you apply to him with sincerity, he will not withhold it. His pub∣lication of Chaucer is the most erudite, curious and valuable performance that (excepting onely that mine of literary treasure Dr. Hickeses Thesaurus, which never had, nor ever will have, its equal) has yet appeared in this country. I do not, however, mean to pronounce it entirely faultless: It undoubtedly contains some mistakes <NOTE N="(58)" PLACE="foot">Such as his supposing Chaucers lines to contain eleven syllables; an idea as just as that 3 and 3 make 7:—his adopting and misspelling certain words contrary to the evidence of all the MSS. he consulted:— a few erroneous notions with respect to Chaucers language, and the nature and history of the English tongue:—with some others, perhaps, of still less consequence: From all which, however, it is to be wished so excellent a work were totally free'd</NOTE>; but they are very few; and, being
<PB N="49" REF="51"/>chiefly confined to matter of opinion, will be thought rather trifleing than important, rather innocent than dangerous. Even the <HI>errors</HI> of SUCH MEN are intitled to respect. And, for the later periods of our literary history, who is there so well informed, so judicious, or so liberal, as the worthy and amiable writer of the "Essay on the Learning of Shakespeare?" Thus assisted, Mr. War∣ton, you might, probably, render your work, in reality, what you have had the modesty to entitle it. Not that I have, after all, the slightest expectation of your taking any further trouble about the matter; unless, indeed, the sale of the revised work should appear likely to produce you some considerable advantage. However, you are equally obliged to me for my good advice, whether you embrace it or not. And as I am satisfyed that you will continue to write upon the subject, so long as you can find materials, however, flimsy, or purchasers, however simple, I beg leave to recommend to a respectable department in your <HI>seventh</HI> volume, or rather to a volume or two of its own, a Virgin Article for which I have highest regard:—The Poetical Annals of the British Nursery:—With two learned Differtations—I. On the origin and use of the ancient <HI>Lullabies;</HI> II. On the GESTA ROMANORUM of the Nur∣sery—Mother Goose's Tales. You could not reasonably desire a more ample field for the display of your amazing erudition in all its branches. Your "episode" (and the more "disproportionate" it is, the better) on a thea∣tre, which, as you very justly observe, is "of the lowest species, and the highest antiquity," will be allowed to comprehend the whole history of the genuine mode of scenic representiation, from Thespis to Flockton; interspersed with a variety of surprising observations, and unheared of facts. These will eke out many a loose and easy page; while your disquisitions upon Puerile Architecture, or the art of constructing Castles of Cards, will not onely involve the rise, progress, and grand arcana of Free-masonry, which are all comprised in this curious and antique process, but give you, at the same time, a fine op∣portunity of exhibiting your whole fund of knowlege in the science, of which you have induced us to believe that you are perfect master; and by not writing, at least not publishing, your promised work, have been wise enough not to undeceive us. One cannot easyly imagine a more pleasing or fruitful subject, nor a historian better qualifyed to do it justice; unless, in∣deed, your want of fidelity and care may be thought an insuperable objection: But I am not without hope that even the present address will have the good fortune to make you a little more cautious on those heads in your future lu∣cubrations.</P>
