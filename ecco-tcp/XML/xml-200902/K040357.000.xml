<LG>
<L>TO grace the elbow-chair of age,</L>
<L>ROSCIUS, the monarch of the stage;</L>
<L>(For ROSCIUS was in years, well stricken,</L>
<L>Besides that he began to thicken)</L>
<L>Resolv'd to lay the sceptre down,</L>
<L>And make his exit from the town.</L>
<L>To this intent, he summon'd strait,</L>
<L>The lords and commons of his state,</L>
<L>A motley tribe as you should see;</L>
<L>A theatre's variety;</L>
<L>From Madam YATES, to COLUMBINE:</L>
<L>He summon'd them, exact at nine,</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="4"/>Exact at nine, the parties came,</L>
<L>Some known to famine, some to fame.</L>
<L>In the same room (for once) they met;</L>
<L>The tragic ladies, took their seat:</L>
<L>The little folks, were on the scout</L>
<L>And fairly wish'd themselves without:</L>
<L>The gentlemen, stroll'd here and there</L>
<L>Till ROSCIUS came, and took the chair:</L>
<L>Then stood, in attitude profound,</L>
<L>And thus address'd the circle round.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"MY subjects and my friends, adieu:</L>
<L>I now am come, to part with you.</L>
<L>Full forty years, in various places,</L>
<L>Have I, alas, been making faces:</L>
<L>During which time—as you can tell,</L>
<L>Much have I talk'd of heaven, and hell;</L>
<L>Myself have stabb'd, through every part;</L>
<L>And often given away my heart;</L>
<L>Imaginary crimes committed,</L>
<L>Been hated, scorn'd, admir'd, and pitied:</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="5"/>My father strangled, kill'd my brother,</L>
<L>And play'd the devil with my mother;</L>
<L>To day a fool, to morrow wiser,</L>
<L>A monarch, manager, and miser.</L>
<L>Ten thousand times this hand, has press'd</L>
<L>In mimic agony, my breast;</L>
<L>I've died for love, and rose again,</L>
<L>On purpose to repeat my pain.</L>
<L>At once I've stabb'd both man and maid</L>
<L>And, now and then, a tyrant play'd.</L>
<L>Not Sir JOHN HILL, so much has wrote,</L>
<L>As I have spoken through my throat;</L>
<L>'Tis true indeed, we all rehearse</L>
<L>Each year, a waggon load of verse;</L>
<L>I, when the poet lost his gift,</L>
<L>Have kindly given the man a lift,</L>
<L>When poets, weighty matters cobble,</L>
<L>And their gall'd jades begin to hobble,</L>
<L>The player, doctors up their feet,</L>
<L>And makes them seem, both sound and fleet;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="6"/>This have I done—with your assistance,</L>
<L>Tho' sometimes, we scarce sav'd our distance:</L>
<L>Bards, now a days, would lose the race,</L>
<L>If players, did not mend their pace,</L>
<L>So apt their hackneys are to trip,</L>
<L>That did we not work spur, and whip,</L>
<L>Scarce is there one among them all,</L>
<L>But would, ere course the second, fall:</L>
<L>To tell you then my serious wish,</L>
<L>I'm tir'd of this poetic dish,</L>
<L>So mean to bid farewel to verse,</L>
<L>And live upon my prose, and purse:</L>
<L>I'm on the edges of threescore,</L>
<L>'Tis really time to give it o'er;</L>
<L>I need not counterfeit a wrinkle!</L>
<L>Behold—it strikes you in a twinkle!</L>
<L>The step of sixty, as I stir</L>
<L>You see: 'tis downright angular I</L>
<L>I'm now unfit for rant and riot,</L>
<L>And so determine to be quiet;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="7"/>No more will I the PROTEUS play,</L>
<L>But choose henceforth the private way:</L>
<L>Nay, Mr. KING, you need not stare,</L>
<L>I am in earnest <HI>now</HI> I swear;</L>
<L>As player, manager, and poet,</L>
<L>"I've done some service, and you know it:"</L>
<L>I've had my struggles, like the moor,</L>
<L>A time there was, when I was poor:</L>
<L>Now farewel hair-breadth 'scapes, and slavings,</L>
<L>Hail—three times hail—my little savings:</L>
<L>I never coveted such stuff,</L>
<L>But will retire, with just enough</L>
<L>To line the evening couch with down,</L>
<L>And keep a cottage out of town,</L>
<L>My homely Hampton hut, I mean,</L>
<L>Altho' a plain, a pleasant scene;</L>
<L>A palace ill befitteth age,</L>
<L>Mine, is the season to be sage;</L>
<L>And that's, another reason, why</L>
<L>I lay this bustling business by:</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="8"/>Altho' of actors, I am king</L>
<L>The hour, alas, is on the wing</L>
<L>When I, and real monarchs, must</L>
<L>Lay all our royalties in dust:</L>
<L>I now an <HI>awful</HI> part should act,</L>
<L>And fable, must give way to fact:</L>
<L>You see my purpose, and my plan;</L>
<L>No more the player, but the man.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THEN friends farewel, but ere I quit,</L>
<L>These well known scenes, of sense and wit;</L>
<L>These ever-honour'd, sacred boards,</L>
<L>Where such a levee grand, of lords,</L>
<L>Where kings and queens, so oft have stood,</L>
<L>And died—with little loss of blood;</L>
<L>Where conquerors of every clime,</L>
<L>Have, night by night, harangued in rhime;</L>
<L>Where, by the aid of good blank verse,</L>
<L>Stout heroes, have improved their curse:</L>
<L>Where dukes, of every sort and size,</L>
<L>Have complimented ladies eyes;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="9"/>Where chiefs, have fought their country's cause,</L>
<L>And statesmen made, and unmade laws;</L>
<L>Where countesses, have drain'd the bowl,</L>
<L>Or stabb'd the form, to save the soul;</L>
<L>While virgins, rather than submit,</L>
<L>Their pretty, panting hearts have hit;</L>
<L>Where all of <HI>us,</HI> have had our blows,</L>
<L>Our sieges, battles, joys, and woes;</L>
<L>Ah friends—I cannot leave this place,</L>
<L>Till I have given my last embrace;</L>
<L>My eyes will linger to this spot,</L>
<L>Till you my last advice, have got.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FRIENDS, ours, is oft a dangerous trade,</L>
<L>Take then a recipe I've made,</L>
<L>I've tried its efficacy long,</L>
<L>Mind and apply it to the tongue:</L>
<L>The legs, and arms, must claim a part;</L>
<L>I've mixt it up, with wondrous art,</L>
<L>'Twill move the soul, and mend each feature;</L>
<L>I'm told, there's not the like in nature,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="10"/>And as a mark, 'twill bear the test,</L>
<L><HI>Me,</HI> it hath made—<HI>Probatum est.</HI></L>
<L>Take first a well-siz'd LOOKING-GLASS,</L>
<L>"And view your shadow as you pass:"</L>
<L>Mark every motion of the eye,</L>
<L>And learn, at will, to laugh and cry,</L>
<L>Observe to step, and start, with grace,</L>
<L>And call up meaning, in the face:</L>
<L>Walk not too narrow, nor too wide,</L>
<L>'Tis like Sir Punch, to strut and stride:</L>
<L>As bad it is, to jerk, and run,</L>
<L>Pray <HI>ladies,</HI> copy ABINGTON.</L>
<L>Observe the breeding in her air,</L>
<L>There's nothing of the actress there:</L>
<L>Assume her fashion if you can;</L>
<L>And catch the graces of her fan.</L>
<L>Learn in the mirror, how to stare,</L>
<L>To smile in joy, to droop in care:</L>
<L>With ease, to hector-it, or sin-it,</L>
<L>And be the PROTEUS of the minute:</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="11"/>From gloomy, shift to the serene,</L>
<L>And learn to methodise your mien:</L>
<L>In drawing off a glove, I'll tell,</L>
<L>Whether a woman is bred well,</L>
<L>In tieing on a solitaire,</L>
<L>Or in the tender of a chair,</L>
<L>Or managing the limbs below,</L>
<L>I know whate'er a man can do.</L>
<L>I prithee never <HI>pause</HI> too long,</L>
<L>A trick I got, when I was young,</L>
<L>A trick, my enemies have told,</L>
<L>But habits, seldom leave the old.</L>
<L>The glass may teach, to bow and kneel,</L>
<L>But <HI>heaven</HI> alone can make you <HI>feel:</HI></L>
<L>From that fair fount, the truth must flow,</L>
<L>Yet, art can make a shift you know;</L>
<L>I've found it frequently supply,</L>
<L>The want of sensibility.</L>
<L>But then, 'twill take up all your leisure,</L>
<L>Ere you can make such toil a pleasure;</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="12"/>For where dame Nature is unkind,</L>
<L>And scarcely half makes up the mind,</L>
<L>While Fortune, like a scurvy jade,</L>
<L>Tosses that mind, upon our trade,</L>
<L>It follows, as a clear effect,</L>
<L>That notwithstanding such neglect,</L>
<L>If Nature will not do her part,</L>
<L>The business must be done by <HI>art.</HI></L>
<L>In stage-affairs, as in a watch,</L>
<L>There's many a wheel, and many a catch,</L>
<L>In both the mechanism's fine,</L>
<L>Your lookers-on, can ne'er divine,</L>
<L>What a mere juggle 'tis to play;</L>
<L>And yet this juggle <HI>does,</HI> I say.</L>
<L>Who only views the watch's face,</L>
<L>Conceive not what's within the case;</L>
<L>Enough for them, if truth it tell,</L>
<L>And bids SUE roast the mutton well,</L>
<L>The fine machinery they miss;</L>
<L>As 'tis in that, so 'tis in this.</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="13"/>I would not have you then despair,</L>
<L>Tho' Nature, should her blessings spare,</L>
<L>Tho' some of you, should feel no more,</L>
<L>Than DUNSTAN'S giants o'er church door:</L>
<L>Sheer art, may move a man about,</L>
<L>And who's to find the secret out:</L>
<L>Take heed, 'twill seem all skill and knowledge,</L>
<L>Might pose the fellow of a college.</L>
<L>Have you not seen, in LEAR, and FOOL,</L>
<L>(Where players often rave by rule)</L>
<L>The calling out—a mouse, a mouse,</L>
<L>Has fairly <HI>taken in,</HI> the house.</L>
<L>If well the changeling throws his hat,</L>
<L>Make sure of your applause for that:</L>
<L>One minute marks a start, at most,</L>
<L>But, if on entrance of a ghost,</L>
<L>You stamp but loud enough, and six,</L>
<L>Instead of one, you may take six:</L>
<L>'Twere well indeed, if, when <HI>it's</HI> come,</L>
<L>With dext'rous dash of hand, or thumb,</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="14"/>You caus'd the hair, to stand an end;</L>
<L>As that would much the horror mend:</L>
<L>When HAMLET's phantom you pursue,</L>
<L>Gaze, as if every lamp burnt blue:</L>
<L>But when its errand you would know,</L>
<L>Take care, to stagger as you go:</L>
<L>Then, as it waves you, not to vex it,</L>
<L>Let the sword tremble in your exit.</L>
<L>To make King RICHARD, there's a knack;</L>
<L>Be perfect, in the leg, and back;</L>
<L>The eyebrow, should be broad, and dark:</L>
<L>And give to murder, every mark</L>
<L>His fell complottings and designs,</L>
<L>Should startle in the face's lines;</L>
<L>Give him the dark assassin's airs</L>
<L>And catch the audience unawares.</L>
<L>Much, much, dear folks, depends on dress;</L>
<L>The seemly ruff of royal BESS,</L>
<L>The flourish, when she gives the blow,</L>
<L>The royal train, and furbelow,</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="15"/>The thundering boast, of blustering PIERRE,</L>
<L>The straw-made crown, of crazy LEAR,</L>
<L>OTHELLO's face, OPHELIA's willow,</L>
<L>And DESDRMONA's strangling pillow:</L>
<L><HI>Your</HI> hose, ye fair, when boys you play,</L>
<L>White chins, when age is in decay,</L>
<L>Fat FALSTAFF's shield, and mountain belly,</L>
<L>Are half the battle, let me tell ye:</L>
<L>If once the galleries give the hand,</L>
<L>A fig, for those that understand,</L>
<L>The men of taste, you know, are rare,</L>
<L>The boxes, seldom heed the player:</L>
<L>Mind not the critic's <HI>hiss</HI> at flaws,</L>
<L>'Tis buried in the fool's applause.</L>
<L>Is genius wanting—trust to trick,</L>
<L>'Twill prove the actor's walking-stick:</L>
<L>There are, who use it every year:</L>
<L>Tho' none of my good people here.</L>
<L>But where true taste is given, escape,</L>
<L>That which will make you play the ape:</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="16"/>Where there is genius—in such cases,</L>
<L>The passions know their proper places;</L>
<L>Just where they ought, behold them rise,</L>
<L>Or flow in tears, or heave in sighs:</L>
<L>They animate the brightest jest,</L>
<L>And mighty nature stands confest:</L>
<L>What therefore, I remark'd, at first,</L>
<L>Was putting matters at the worst;</L>
<L>As providence bestow'd the power,</L>
<L>I ne'er could bear <HI>finesse</HI> an hour:</L>
<L>My ARCHER, is your comic sample,</L>
<L>And LEAR affords a grave example.</L>
<L>Of other points, there are a few,</L>
<L>That I will now reveal to you.</L>
<L>And first, it would not be amiss,</L>
<L>But here and there prevent a hiss,</L>
<L>If some of you would condescend</L>
<L>A certain <HI>careless</HI> air to mend;</L>
<L>'Tis villainous to search the pit,</L>
<L>To find where your admirers sit.</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="17"/>Nor is it right, to stare on <HI>high,</HI></L>
<L>Intrigueing with the gallery:</L>
<L>Or to the boxes, give your eyes,</L>
<L>While on the stage a lady sighs:</L>
<L>Believe me, there is much to <HI>play,</HI></L>
<L>Ev'n when you have no more to <HI>say:</HI></L>
<L>Some, at the close of every speech,</L>
<L>Will, saucy, turn upon their breech;</L>
<L>Dear ladies, pray forgive the word,</L>
<L>But, faith, the custom's more absurd;</L>
<L>Never conclude your business past,</L>
<L>Till act the fifth, and line the last.</L>
<L>Oft have I been, the friend in danger,</L>
<L>When him I lov'd, stood, like a stranger;</L>
<L>And tho' next scene I was to die,</L>
<L>By draught, or dart, or sympathy:</L>
<L>(For broken hearts with <HI>us,</HI> are common</L>
<L>I've often crack'd a cord for woman)</L>
<L>The fellow, was so lost to feeling,</L>
<L>I might as well have hugg'd the ceiling;</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="18"/>One of his <HI>hands,</HI> indeed, was near</L>
<L>To take my tributary tear;</L>
<L>While other members, making love</L>
<L>Were set, to trap the nymphs above.</L>
<L>Sure gentlemen; you'll grant me this:</L>
<L>A time to act, a time to kiss;</L>
<L>Resrain but till the curtain's down,</L>
<L>Then Ranger-it, thro' all the town.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT really there is no excuse,</L>
<L>Where kissing, is so much in use.</L>
<L>The modern stage, is no way slack,</L>
<L>In granting you an honest smack:</L>
<L>I cannot recollect the play,</L>
<L>Where poets do not shew the way;</L>
<L>There's scarce a scene of <HI>tragic</HI> bliss,</L>
<L>But they have introduc'd a kiss,</L>
<L>Or if a <HI>comedy</HI>'s their <HI>forte,</HI></L>
<L>There's always something of that sort.</L>
<L>The drama now, however chaste,</L>
<L>In tender matters, near the waist;</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="19"/>Tho' they run round and round the riddle,</L>
<L>Girding a zone about the middle:</L>
<L>Yet all, who deal, in deaths and faintings,</L>
<L>Our dapsters at <HI>dramatic</HI> paintings,</L>
<L>However artfully, each draws</L>
<L>O'er sacred parts the virtuous <HI>gauze:</HI></L>
<L>There's none so churlish, to dispute,</L>
<L>The players right to a salute:</L>
<L>In times of WYCHERLY indeed,</L>
<L>A Man, might modestly proceed,</L>
<L>Might leave the lips, and—in a pet</L>
<L>Said Y—G—"Pray sir, don't you forget?</L>
<L>I wish pure precepts, you'd convey,</L>
<L>And treat us—in a decent way:</L>
<L>When <HI>ladies</HI> in the room are sitting</L>
<L>Say is it sitting ROSCIUS"—<HI>Fitting!</HI></L>
<L>As heaven shall judge me by its laws,</L>
<L>I only fight the female cause,</L>
<L>My argument will plainly prove,</L>
<L>You have a right to claim our love:</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="20"/>Whatever characters you play,</L>
<L>Or great, or little, grave, or gay,</L>
<L>While your dear forms are on the stage</L>
<L>You every motion should engage;</L>
<L>And he, who turns away his head—</L>
<L>The prompter—ought to strike him dead:</L>
<L>There's not a man in the creation,</L>
<L>Has for THE SEX such veneration.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>IT now remains, ere I go hence,</L>
<L>To thank you, for your diligence.</L>
<L>Sickness, 'tis true, will oft disable:</L>
<L><HI>Pretended</HI> sickness, is a fable;</L>
<L>The papers, have been full of <HI>this;</HI></L>
<L>But I, blame nature for each miss;</L>
<L>At duty's call you <HI>all</HI> would come,</L>
<L>But—that you could not get from home:</L>
<L>Nay you'd have ventur'd in a chair,</L>
<L>Had you not fear'd—the evening air.</L>
<L>I know a lady's resolution,</L>
<L>But who can help her constitution.</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="21"/>And had you left your hoods and screens,</L>
<L>You might have died behind the scenes.</L>
<L>I credit not the idle tale</L>
<L>"She is not sick, she does not ail,"</L>
<L>I've seldom pry'd for your complaint,</L>
<L>Convinc'd, you were above a feint,</L>
<L>But <HI>sure,</HI> of your indisposition,</L>
<L>Have often sent you a physician.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SOME may have had it much at heart,</L>
<L>Because they did not like a <HI>part.</HI></L>
<L>Some fair ones, have been apt to quarrel</L>
<L>And could not fancy their <HI>apparel:</HI></L>
<L>It seems I've too much trimm'd a train,</L>
<L>When 'twould have prettier look'd, if plain:</L>
<L>I have not always pleas'd my beaux</L>
<L>In the division of the cloaths:</L>
<L>I have giv'n gold, for silver lace,</L>
<L>And sometimes sulted ill, a face:</L>
<L>Complexions differ, and stage dresses,</L>
<L>Should always match the skan and tresses:</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="22"/>But far from me the blame may pass,</L>
<L>The fault was in—the LOOKING-GLASS:</L>
<L>Ladies, indeed it told not truth,</L>
<L>Each habit much improv'd your youth;</L>
<L>And when you were displeas'd with <HI>me,</HI></L>
<L>'Twas I adorn'd—a deity.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>PERHAPS, a word may be expected,</L>
<L>Of Bards, who think themselves neglected.</L>
<L>It is no easy task, to rule</L>
<L>The scribbling tribe, and every sool,</L>
<L>Who pelts a man with manuscripts,</L>
<L>And crowds on him, mishapen slips;</L>
<L>Things, half begot, and born in pain,</L>
<L>The very Faetus of the brain.</L>
<L>Some of you know, my window-seat;</L>
<L>The piles of paper, there you meet,</L>
<L>Are but the bastards of the day,</L>
<L>From trash, that spawn a mushroom play:</L>
<L>Abortions, sprung from parents poor,</L>
<L>That lie—like foundlings—at my door:</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="23"/>In charity, I take them up,</L>
<L>Altho' not worth my caudle-cup:</L>
<L>The sire, without dramatic sap,</L>
<L>How can the son, be rear'd by pap?</L>
<L>Yet all, I keep a decent time,</L>
<L>In ragged swatheing-cloaths of rhime:</L>

<L>And—take them to another friend.</L>

<L>EXTRACT a moral, from a tale:</L>
<L>A Grazier, once had steers for sale;</L>
<L>Horses just broke, and heifers grown,</L>
<L>Pigs, calves, and other kine, his <HI>own.</HI></L>
<L>To market, as he went one day,</L>

<L>Beg'd, with a smile, an equal favour,</L>
<L>Talk'd of a lameness in his legs</L>
<L>And press'd upon him, all his eggs:</L>
<L>It was not DOB's denying day,</L>
<L>So, with his load, he trudg'd away.</L>
<L>But just as if 'twas ne'er to end,</L>
<L>Hard by, he saw a <HI>female</HI> friend:</L>
<L>She too, had met a bad disaster,</L>
<L>For which repose would prove a plaister:</L>
<L>How much, she said, would he oblige,</L>
<L>If he would take, her Friday's cheese?</L>
<L>The Grazier, though almost weigh'd down</L>
<L>Agreed, and toiling, went to town.</L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="25"/>'Twas sultry noon when he got there</L>
<L>And now, came on, our Grazier's care.</L>
<L>Off went his horses, to his mind,</L>
<L>His heifers, did not stay behind:</L>
<L>His lambkins, bore a market price,</L>
<L>His hogs, found buyers, in a trice.</L>
<L>The market then was at a stand;</L>
<L>His neighbours' goods, remain in hand,</L>
<L>He scarcely sold an egg an hour,</L>
<L>And night, at last began, to lower:</L>
<L>Longer to stay, would be in vain,</L>
<L>And so he drove <HI>them</HI> back again.</L>
<L>The man with the rheumatic legs,</L>
<L>Who was the owner of the eggs,</L>
<L>The swain, who sent the oxen too,</L>
<L>Now on our luckless Grazier flew;</L>
<L>They tore his coat, they bruis'd his eye—</L>
<L>He was at last, compell'd to fly.</L>
<L>Yet, how was the poor man to blame,</L>
<L>He would have sold, if buyers came:</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="26"/>He could not <HI>force</HI> the beef, and cheese,</L>
<L>The Town was <HI>full</HI> of purchases;</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE morning registers of fame,</L>
<L>Soon set the city in a flame:</L>
<L>A favourite player to retire,</L>
<L>Is worse than the alarm of fire:</L>
<L>The <HI>ignis fatuus</HI> of the stage,</L>
<L>Runs ripe, and rapid, through the age:</L>
<L>And though two mighty nations wait,</L>
<L>Upon the councils of the state;</L>
<L>Yet like true patriots at the heart,</L>
<L>We look when ROSCIUS plays a part:</L>
<L>Whate'er's theatrical devour,</L>
<L>And give to him, th' important hour.</L>
<L><PB N="30" REF="32"/>The papers told, that he resign'd;</L>
<L>At this you guess the public mind:</L>
<L>Hang all the folks across the main,</L>
<L>So ROSCIUS, would but act again.</L>
<L>Next day, the matter was averr'd;</L>
<L>Certain, the patent, was transferr'd;</L>
<L>Song, sonnet, ditty, sought the press,</L>
<L>And half, the town, was in distress.</L>
<L>The matter, scarce abroad had flown,</L>
<L>Ere it arriv'd at Helicon;</L>
<L>Swift to the muses' laurell'd court,</L>
<L>A poet, went, to make report;</L>
<L>For poets, be it noted, go,</L>
<L>On such affairs, incognito:</L>
<L>And tho' to sceptics, it seem odd,</L>
<L>In point of speed, shall match a god:</L>
<L>They stride not, ordinary horse,</L>
<L>But PEGASUS, performs the course:</L>
<L>A beast, that traverses the air;</L>
<L>More fleet than your arabian mare.</L>
<L><PB N="31" REF="33"/>Thus, poets get to Hypocrene,</L>
<L>Ere Sunday cits, to TURNHAM GREEN.</L>
<L>PHOEBUS, allows the miracle,</L>
<L>And so, they ride invisible.</L>
<L>Hence 'tis, the ponies of PARNASS,</L>
<L>All other quadrupedes surpass;</L>
<L>The reason's evident, the mead</L>
<L>Is consecrated, where they feed:</L>
<L>The best historians alledge,</L>
<L>There's something holy, in each hedge:</L>
<L>That sacred herbage blooms around,</L>
<L>And not a thistle in the ground:</L>
<L>A nettle, here and there, you find,</L>
<L>For steeds that are to wit inclin'd:</L>
<L>Even then, there's honey round the sting,</L>
<L>But for a weed—there's no such thing.</L>
<L>In vain you look for winter here,</L>
<L>'Tis June, rich June, throughout the year:</L>
<L>Hence 'tis, that all the coursers' noses,</L>
<L>Are perfum'd with parnassian posies;</L>
<L><PB N="32" REF="34"/>For, as the creatures stoop to graze,</L>
<L>They bite—and fill the mouth with bays:</L>
<L>The fillies, chiefly choose to eat</L>
<L>The primrose, pagle, violet,</L>
<L>Because this sort of food, it seems,</L>
<L>Inspires your pretty past'ral themes:</L>
<L>On jemmy, gentle seet, they run,</L>
<L>And frisk, and frolic in the fun:</L>
<L>In short, the fields, are here so fine,</L>
<L>They prove that every blade's divine,</L>
<L>Such too, is their peculiar force,</L>
<L>A bard they make, of ass, or horse:</L>
<L>Certain, as wings grace Hermes' cap,</L>
<L>Whatever eats, and takes a nap,</L>
<L>Right good sufficient poets wake;</L>
<L>The better, if their thirst they slake</L>
<L>At CABALLINE, the horses fountain;</L>
<L>Which lies on t'other side the mountain;</L>
<L>Some fearful fools, too tame to blunder,</L>
<L>Have set these matters, far asunder,</L>
<L><PB N="33" REF="35"/>The river in BEOTIA placing,</L>
<L>And PHOCIS call the spot they graze in,</L>
<L>But poet real, mule or man,</L>
<L>Despises critic's rigid plan:</L>
<L>And skip through kingdoms in a minute,</L>
<L>Think of a place—whew—pass—they're in it:</L>
<L>Your bards dramatical, shall run</L>
<L>And win the sweepstakes, from the sun;</L>
<L>In waving of a goose's feather,</L>
<L>Shall draw the distant poles together;</L>
<L>On wings, scarce fledg'd, with ease can fly</L>
<L>From CATHARINE street, to CASTALY:</L>
<L>Then dig the spur, add loose the rein,</L>
<L>Dine in the Strand, and sup in Spain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THESE points premis'd, we will not fail,</L>
<L>To see who went to tell the tale.</L>
<L>Trust me, there was no less than seven,</L>
<L>Now made a vig'rous push for heaven:</L>
<L>DAN ROSCIUS rang'd them in a row;</L>
<L>And every one desired to go:</L>
<L><PB N="34" REF="36"/>Their coursers you'll suppose were there,</L>
<L>Pawing, to gallop through the air:</L>
<L>Reader you'll note, that heaven's a phrase,</L>
<L>We, authors, use in different ways,</L>
<L>The skies above, lay constant claim,</L>
<L>And HELICON enjoys the name:</L>
<L>Nay what will startle most, I know,</L>
<L>We give it, to the shades below:</L>
<L>In short sirs, every place of rest,</L>
<L>Is heaven, because it suits in best;</L>
<L>So, whatsoever's bad or bitter,</L>
<L>Is hell, to make the sense compleater,</L>
<L>This licence, chiefly marks <HI>our</HI> charter,</L>
<L>So wonder not, at what comes A 'TER.</L>
<L>In verse like this, the bard's allow'd</L>
<L>A privilege, deny'd the crowd;</L>
<L>A letter, we ne'er mind a pin,</L>
<L>But cast it out, or keep it in:</L>
<L>Odd syllables, we cut, and clip,</L>
<L>And half a word, with ease o'erskip;</L>
<L><PB N="35" REF="37"/>So, that at top we put our dashes,</L>
<L>The critic heeds not, such small flashes;</L>
<L>This right, prince BUTLER did ordain,</L>
<L>And SWIFT, confirm'd the act again:</L>
<L>DAN PRIOR, sign'd it with his hand,</L>
<L>A law poetic, through the land;</L>
<L>Since these so often par'd the line,</L>
<L>There's none will cavil sure, at mine:</L>
<L>Say, I clip oft'ner, I'm the less;</L>
<L>But to return—I shall digress.</L>

<L>THE bard, who saddled first his steed,</L>
<L>Was of a mixt, and mongrel breed:</L>
<L>His PEGASUS, scarce known to fame,</L>
<L>Tho' young, and mettlesome, was lame;</L>
<L>One that ne'er won a noble bet,</L>
<L>But threw the heel at all he met;</L>
<L>In going a dog-trot lie stumbled,</L>
<L>Yet snorting, restive, and ne'er humbled;</L>
<L>You'd think its master, was a bruiser,</L>
<L>I lack a rhime—Proceed—'twill do sir—</L>
<L><PB N="36" REF="38"/>Yet was it plump, as pad of parson:</L>
<L>The beast might serve to bring a <HI>farce on:</HI></L>
<L>Indeed he has been known to pray,</L>
<L>And written, almost half a play:</L>
<L>Nay to do justice to the steed,</L>
<L>'Tis certain he the news could read;</L>
<L>There are who say—you need not laugh,</L>
<L>He actually could <HI>paragraph,</HI></L>
<L>The column ken'd with critic eyes,</L>
<L>And wrote both question, and replies;</L>
<L>Howe'er this be, he did not fail</L>
<L>To be a <HI>candidate,</HI> for the mail.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To search too nicely for the reason,</L>
<L>Would at this time be out of season:</L>
<L>But ROSCIUS, thought not fit to send</L>
<L>This courier, tho' esteem'd a friend:</L>
<L>Rumour declar'd—but she's a hag,</L>
<L>That ROSCIUS had long fed his nag:</L>
<L>And some were bold enough to swear,</L>
<L><HI>This</HI> courier's beast engag'd his care,</L>
<L><PB N="37" REF="39"/>While blooded horses left to play,</L>
<L>Could scarce get either corn or hay;</L>
<L>That many a prancer, stout and able,</L>
<L>Was left to swell at leg, in stable,</L>
<L>While this queer creature was rubb'd down,</L>
<L>And made a fight of, for the town.</L>
<L>But not to tire you with suggestion,</L>
<L>I haste to things beyond a question:</L>
<L>Altho' by taking off, a cup</L>
<L>Of that same water, poets sup,</L>
<L>And dining well, on heavenly sallads,</L>
<L>Might mend our author's knack at <HI>ballads;</HI></L>
<L>'Tis clear, Sir ROSCIUS did not choose</L>
<L>To dub <HI>him</HI> postman to the MUSE.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE second was a bard obscure,</L>
<L>That wanted much, a sinecure,</L>
<L>The master of a galloway,</L>
<L>Exceeding apt to <HI>run away,</HI></L>
<L>That lately threw a lady down,</L>
<L>Then scamper'd with her thro' the town.</L>
<L><PB N="38" REF="40"/>Quoth ROSCIUS, "It can't be, my friend</L>
<L>I might as well, an ANDREW send.</L>
<L>How am I sure, ere you get there,</L>
<L>You will not settle in the air;</L>
<L>The Tit you ride's a lovely BROWN,</L>
<L>But who's to, bring the message down?"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE four next candidates, were such,</L>
<L>As prov'd a little, was too much,</L>
<L>Your men of FARCE and INTERLUDE;</L>
<L>Who teaze the town with trifles crude;</L>
<L>Who give their tiny pop-guns play,</L>
<L>To pelt the folly of the day:</L>
<L>Whom ROSCIUS artfully employs,</L>
<L>To keep the galleries—from noise.</L>
<L>When tragic heroines, in disguise,</L>
<L>Are now no <HI>more</HI> to cheat the eyes:</L>
<L>When she, who lately seem'd a brother,</L>
<L>In scene the next, turns out a mother:</L>
<L>When passions are no more at strife,</L>
<L>And the poor man may <HI>own</HI> his wife:</L>
<L><PB N="39" REF="41"/>Till she puts on her woman weeds,</L>
<L>'Tis certain that a <HI>pause</HI> succeeds,</L>
<L>And, as it takes both time and pain</L>
<L>To make a boy, a girl again;</L>
<L>'Tis decent, that we use <HI>finesse,</HI></L>
<L>That each fair lady, may undress;</L>
<L>Hence ROSCIUS, being politic,</L>
<L>Engages those same sons of trick;</L>
<L>A tribe of low dramatic hacks,</L>
<L>To fill the space, between the acts.</L>
<L>Their sense and taste, were nearly even,</L>
<L>But all unfit, alas, for heaven.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>ON these accounts, he call'd a crony,</L>
<L>Who kept a very pretty poney:</L>
<L>A thing of fashion, brisk, and neat,</L>
<L>And swift of foot, altho' <HI>petite:</HI></L>
<L>Well he maintain'd a poet's cause,</L>
<L>A stickler stout, for critic laws:</L>
<L>The steed, was little, but not lazy,</L>
<L>The rider, dapper as a daisy.</L>
<L><PB N="40" REF="42"/>With fairy step, together, they,</L>
<L>Had tripp'd to PARIS for a play;</L>
<L>Thither, each year, the pair would prance,</L>
<L>To catch the comedy of FRANCE</L>
<L><HI>Him,</HI> ROSCIUS, deem'd a proper hard,</L>
<L>To carry off the message-card:</L>
<L>"Then mount, dear GEORGE, said he, your steed</L>
<L>And pray return to me with speed."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>ALTHO" our poet did not race,</L>
<L>He deftly, went a decent pace:</L>
<L>And those who take long journeys, know</L>
<L>Your <HI>even</HI> riders, fastest go:</L>
<L>Thus, tho' he did not stretch and tear;</L>
<L>He canter'd regularly there.</L>
<L>For, though a dramatist, and fleet,</L>
<L>His PEGASUS, ohey'd the bit.</L>
<L>Some bards, full cautious, and exact,</L>
<L>Are sway'd, by ARISTOTLE'S act,</L>
<L>Which doth provide, in certain cases,</L>

<L>Is call'd a <HI>literary treason:</HI></L>
<L>Would you, with these same laws comply?</L>
<L>Then—reverence probability.</L>
<L>Aw'd, therefore, by the sage's plan,</L>
<L>Steadily went, our little man:</L>
<L>Arriv'd, he hail'd the sacred spring,</L>
<L>Dismounted, and address'd the ring:</L>
<L>For as it chanc'd, the ladies nine,</L>

<L>Cried the sad muses, with a stare;</L>
<L>All rose confus'd, some swore 'twas fable;</L>
<L>Some, spilt the nectar on the table:</L>
<L>Queen TRAGEDY, was in despair,</L>
<L>The COMIC LADY tore her hair:</L>

<L>And they began to thump their breasts:</L>
<L>And though, perhaps, 'twas only art,</L>
<L>Each fair one, acted well her part;</L>
<L>They topt it sir, as they had been</L>
<L>Six summers, training for the scene:</L>
<L><PB N="43" REF="45"/>I'm led to judge it a deceit,</L>
<L>(At best a modish counterfeit)</L>
<L>Because tho' some amongst them had</L>
<L>Sufficient reason to run mad;</L>

<L>And her sad sister, sob and sigh:</L>
<L>Yet really all <HI>the rest</HI> might spare,</L>
<L>Their woful looks, and fullen air.</L>
<L>For those to whimper—'twas a whim,</L>
<L>He scarce knew them, they scarce knew him:</L>
<L>And wherefore could the charming GRACES,</L>
<L>Distort, and spoil their lovely faces?</L>
<L>The thing, as it appears to me,</L>
<L>Is, that they wept for <HI>sympathy:</HI></L>
<L>For, if you criticise, you shall</L>

<L>Afar he travels, on the hoof:</L>
<L>His theatre without a roof:</L>
<L><PB N="68" REF="70"/>In a vile barn, he butchers LEAR,</L>
<L>And stabbs the regimental'd PIERRE:</L>
<L>But ev'n if all his toils succeed,</L>
<L>Prithee, dear WILLIAM, mark the meed:</L>
<L>Full oft he bustles half the night,</L>
<L>Yet scarcely gets a supper by't;</L>
<L>On thy fine thoughts he feeds by day;</L>
<L>The <HI>famish'd sovereign</HI>—of a play;</L>
<L>The vagrant hut, rewards his pains,</L>
<L>And the world frowns upon his gains:</L>
<L>Not pedlar, gipsy, jesuit,</L>
<L>Not ballad-wenches, in the street;</L>
<L>Not base buffoon, on scaffolding;</L>
<L>Not bullock, baited at the ring;</L>
<L>Nor beggar dieting at door;</L>
<L>Nor the chance children of the poor;</L>
<L>A lot so hard "—I prithee stop;</L>
<L>Return'd the bard—the subject drop,</L>
<L>For if their private life be good,</L>
<L><HI>Blest they may be, whate'er their food.</HI></L>
<L><PB N="69" REF="71"/>"The ship boy on the giddy mast"</L>
<L>My worthy BILLY, not so fast,</L>
<L>Said MAIA'S son—Philosophy.</L>
<L>Is a fine thing, when plenty's nigh;</L>
<L>As to their <HI>goodness,</HI> I confess,</L>
<L>They are the types of holiness;</L>
<L>Tho' I, sometimes, pass to and fro,</L>
<L>I hear no trips, where'er I go;</L>
<L>So much to deal in sentiment,</L>
<L>Inspires, pure love, esteem, content;</L>
<L>Tho' grocers will their figs neglect,</L>
<L>Actors, will noble thoughts respect;</L>
<L>And hence it is, the real player,</L>
<L>Will live on virtue and the air:</L>
<L>To no one ill is he inclin'd,</L>
<L>Unspotted, both in form and mind.</L>
<L>To do the <HI>ladies</HI> right, their dress,</L>
<L>Even in a <HI>morn,</HI> is cleanliness,</L>
<L>So spruce, you at a glance would swear,</L>
<L>In every pin you saw the player:</L>
<L><PB N="70" REF="72"/>With rumpled cap, and towzled head,</L>
<L>They never breakfast on the bed,</L>
<L>But, as at night, they love parade,</L>
<L>At day, each fair shall match a maid.</L>
<L>In short, the heroines of the scene,</L>
<L>Are full as <HI>chaste,</HI> as they are <HI>clean.</HI></L>

<LG>
<L>HERE HERMES paus'd, and rubb'd his eye.</L>
<L>And why friend MERCURY, so sly,</L>
<L>Rejoin'd the poet—in these days,</L>
<L>Actors, I hear, get pence, and praise;</L>
<L>Fashion it seems, hath chang'd her plan,</L>
<L>TOWN-PLAYER, is a GENTLEMAN.</L>
<L>And surely men of art, and sense,</L>
<L>Have justly to the name pretence;</L>
<L>But, as I scent the city smoak,</L>
<L>Prithee good HERMES spare thy joke,</L>
<L>And, if thou lov'st me, quickly say,</L>
<L>Should ROSCIUS go, who's left to play?</L>
<L>For, since I've been a ghost, my friend,</L>
<L>I little, to such points attend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="71" REF="73"/>
<L>'TIS long, quoth HERMES, Sir, since I,</L>
<L>To either house, have had a fly;</L>
<L>There's little call for you or me.</L>
<L>The news you'll hear from POMINB:</L>
<L>There's SHERIDAN, the old and young,</L>
<L>One fam'd for <HI>speech,</HI> and one for <HI>song:</HI></L>
<L>But, ah dear WILL, a-lack a-day!</L>
<L>'Tis all to sing, and nought to say!</L>
<L>His airs full seventy nights have run,</L>
<L>And yet the game is just begun:</L>
<L>Why Sir, I'm told, this wicked elf,</L>
<L>Has thrown your lordship, on the shelf:</L>
<L>In vain you growl forth, list, oh, list,</L>
<L>Your favorite phantom is not mist;</L>
<L>And when the mob resign <HI>their ghost,</HI></L>
<L>Judge how much footing you have lost:</L>
<L>Uncall'd, old BARRY limps about,</L>
<L>Gets a long sabbath for his gout;</L>
<L>And 'tis with much ado, I hear,</L>
<L>His wife can draw, one tragic tear:</L>
<L><PB N="72" REF="74"/>Methinks the age is <HI>operatiz'd:</HI></L>
<L>SWEET WILLY—you seem much surpriz'd:</L>
<L>HERMES stopt short—the poet frown'd,</L>
<L>And tore the bays his temples bound;</L>
<L>The chaplet, thrice, indignant, shook;</L>
<L>Tost it air, then angry spoke:</L>
<L>"ROSCIUS resign'd! why had he stay'd,</L>
<L>I would go forward, to upbraid—</L>
<L>Oh had I known, what SHAKESPEARE wrote</L>
<L>Would fly, before the sidler's note,</L>
<L>By yonder—but I will not swear,</L>
<L>Why didst thou lead me on thus far?</L>
<L>HERMES your hand—dear friend adieu."</L>
<L>He turn'd about, and backward flew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE God of errands, left alone,</L>
<L>Now bent his course towards HELICON.</L>
<L>Told every MUSE th' appeal was vain,</L>
<L>And in a huff, sought heaven again.</L>
