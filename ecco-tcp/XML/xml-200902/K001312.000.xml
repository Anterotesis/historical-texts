<P>Ah, friend Compton, had you but continued partnership with me to this day, well—Ay, ay, I stuck to Blackwell-hall, till I converted my wool into a golden fleece. You must, like a silly sheep, go privateering, and so be fleeced by the French and Spaniards.</P>

<P>Well said, my old battering ram. You're a loyal subject, and shall never be without his Majesty's picture, while I have a collection. A friend to the King should never want his countenance.

<SPEAKER>Compton.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is this all certain?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Felix.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>True as that you have brought up my son as yours, and I your daughter as an orphan that I had adopted. You know they love each other, and in this union of hearts my grand point is answered. I am so happy my son, by thinking himself not worth a shilling, has escaped the foppery and ideas of dissipation he might have imbibed from a knowledge of be∣ing heir to my fortune; and in your Laura I shall have a daughter-in-law possessed of sense to distin∣guish <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it, though linked to poverty, and gene∣rosity to reward it with her heart.</P>

<P>You wicked man, would you oppose goodness?— Ha, ha, ha! this is pleasant Laura loves Eugene, though she thinks he's not worth a groat; and though he doats upon her, yet, awed by her fortune, the poor fool fighs at hnmble distance. Yes; and egad! there were folks sigh∣ing for him too. Why, do you know, Compton, he has made a conquest of a rich cheesemonger's widow in the Borough, who supposing him much poorer than herself, forced money upon him to lure his affections. Ha, ha, ha! this old mouldy
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
vidow will have him in spite of his teeth; and thinking him still incapable of repaying her in coin, actually designs to hunt him with an at∣torney, and follow him here into the country, to force him into marriage. Ha, ha, ha! but where's Eugene now? because the bridegroom's presence is necessary at a wedding you know.</P>

<P>Yes, sir; but he's a curst fellow, as ignorant as dirt, It seeems he has been a schoolmaster here in the country, taught all the bumpkin fry what he calls Latin; and the damn'd dog so patches his own bad English with his bits of bad Latin, and jumbles the Gods, Goddesses, Heroes celestial and infernal together at such a rate; I took him to oblige a foolish old friend of mine, who intended him for Saint Omers; so I
