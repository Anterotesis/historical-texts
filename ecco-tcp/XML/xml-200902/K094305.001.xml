<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of old St. Paul's.</HEAD>
<P>IT will be proper first to inform my young
<PB N="40" REF="38"/>Readers, that upon the same spot of ground on which St. Paul's now stands, there was formerly a fine old church, built by Ethelbert king of Kent in the year of our Lord six hundred and ten, and de∣dicated to the same Apos∣tle. This church suffered many times by lightning, fire, and other accidents; which was as often repair∣ed: and such parts of it
<PB N="41" REF="39"/>as fell to decay thro' age, were rebuilt; till at last it was destroy's in the great fire of London in 1666, and one thousand and fif∣ty-six years from its first building.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of the foundation, build∣ing, and situation of the present Church.</HEAD>
<P>THE old church of St. Paul's having been de∣stroy'd,
<PB N="42" REF="40"/>as mention'd in the first chapter, and the ruins and rubbish of it cleared in about eight or nine years after; the first foundation stone of this present church was laid by Mr. Strong, a mason, and the second by Mr. Long. land, on the twenty first of June, 1675. at the north∣east corner, facing Cheap∣side: From which time it was not completely fi∣nish'd
<PB N="43" REF="41"/>till the year 1724. being about forty-nine years in building. It was begun and finish'd by the same architect, Sir Chris∣topher Wren, and by the same mason, Mr. Strong abovementioned: The charge of which is said to amount to one million of money, or upwards. The whole building is encom∣passed with strong iron pa∣lisades, all curiously turn'd,
<PB N="44" REF="42"/>about five and twenty hundred in number; which cost fifteen thousand pounds.</P>
<P>This magnisicent struc∣ture, which stands upon the highest ground in the city, near to the west gate, called Ludgate, is the first Cathedral in England built according to the rules of architecture. Its walls are of fine Portland stone, rustic work. Two ranges
<PB N="45" REF="43"/>of pilasters adorn the out∣side, one above the other; the lower consists of about an hundred and twenty, with their entablatues of the Corinthian order, and the upper of as many of the Composite, or Roman order: besides twenty co∣lumns at the west and four at the east end, and those of the portico's, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The spaces between the arches of the windows and
<PB N="46" REF="44"/>the architrave of the lower order, are filled with great variety of curious enrich∣ments, such as cherubims, festoons of flowers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and at the east end is the cipher of W. R. within a garter, on which are the words HONI SOIT QUI MALY PENSE; in English, <HI>Evil be to him that evil thinks:</HI> and this within a fine com∣partment of palm-branch∣es, and placed under an
<PB N="47" REF="45"/>imperial crown, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all finely cut in stone.</P>
<P>All the parts of this grand church, both within and without, are built with such proportion and art, that the eye is charmed with the exact order of its pillars, which support the portico's dome, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the beauty of their capitals; the rich cornish where∣with they are embellished; the number of spacious
<PB N="48" REF="46"/>windows, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In short, the whole fabrick is full of beauty and harmony; and in bigness, strengh of building, figure, and other enrichments in wood, stone, iron, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> equal, if not superior, to any church in Europe.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Of the length, breadth, heighth, and other di∣mensions of St. Paul's Church.</HEAD>
<P>ITS lenght within the wall, from east to west is five hundred feet.</P>
<P>The breadth of the west end is a hundred and sixty two feet.</P>
<P>The breadth between
<PB N="50" REF="48"/>the north and south porti∣co's, or doors, within the walls, is two hundred and forty nine feet.</P>
<P>The breadth of the rest is about a hundred and se∣venteen feet.</P>
<P>The circuit of the walls outwardly is two thousand two hundred and ninety two feet.</P>
<P>The ground plot that this great church stands upon, is two acres, sixteen
<PB N="51" REF="49"/>perches, twenty three yards and one foot.</P>
<P>Its height within, over the middle isle, is eighty-eight feet.</P>
<P>To the top of the west pediment, under the figure of St. Paul, a hundred and twenty feet.</P>
<P>The height of the two Towers at the west front, two hundred and eight feet.</P>
<P>To the gallery of the
<PB N="52" REF="50"/>cupolo, two hundred and eight feet.</P>
<P>To the upper gallery two hundred and seventy six feet; and from thence to the top of the cross, six∣ty four feet.</P>
<P>The height of the cross from the ball, is ten feet; the diameter of the ball is six feet; its circumference eighteen feet; and it will contain ninety bushels; and I have been told, that
<PB N="53" REF="51"/>since it has been up, six∣teen men have been drink∣ing in it at one time; I suppose, to the good health of all their friends round about St. Paul's.</P>

<PB N="55" REF="53"/>
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of the strange conceptions four Indian Kings had of this great building; and how they imagin'd it at first to be one grent rock that grew in that place.</HEAD>
<P><HI>SA Ga Yean Qua Rash Tow,</HI> one of the four Indian Kings who were in this country about thirty-two years ago, amongst
<PB N="56" REF="54"/>other curious remarks which he made whilst he was in England, left be∣hind him the following concerning St. Paul's church.</P>
<P>There stands, says he, on the most rising part of the town a huge house, big enough to contain the whole nation of which I am king.</P>
<P>Our good brother, <HI>E Tow O Koam,</HI> king of the
<PB N="57" REF="55"/>Rivers, is of opinion it was made by the hands of the great God to whom it is consecrated (<HI>meaning</HI> St. Paul.)</P>
<P>The kings of Grana∣jah and of the Six Na∣tions, believe that it was created with the earth, and produced on the same day with the sun and moon.</P>
<P>But, says he, for my own part, and from the best information that I can
<PB N="58" REF="56"/>get of this matter, I am apt to think that this vast temple was fashioned into the shape it now bears by several tools and instru∣ments, of which they have a wonderful variety in this country.</P>
<P>I imagine it was at first only an huge mis-shapen rock that grew upon the top of the hill; which the natives of the country, after having cut it into a
<PB N="59" REF="57"/>kind of regular figure, bor∣ed and hollowed with in∣credible pains and indus∣try; till they had wrought in it all those beautiful vaults and caverns into which it is divided at this day.</P>
<P>As soon as this rock was thus curiously scooped to their liking, then a prodi∣gious number of hands must have been employ'd in chipping the outside of
<PB N="60" REF="58"/>it, and smoothing the sur∣face; which is in several places hewn out into pil∣lars, that stand like the trunks of so many trees, bound about the top with garlands of leaves.</P>
<P>It is probable, says this Indian monarch, that when this great work was begun, which must have been many hundred years ago, there was some reli∣gion among this people;
<PB N="61" REF="59"/>for they give it the name of a Temple, and have a tradition that it was de∣signed for men to pay their devotions in.</P>
<P>And indeed, there are several reasons which make us think that the natives of this country had formerly among them some sort of worship; for they set apart every se∣venth day as sacred. But upon my going into one
<PB N="62" REF="60"/>of those holy houses on that day, I could not ob∣serve any circumstance of devotion in their behavi∣our: There was indeed a man in black who, mount∣ed above the rest, seemed to utter something with great vehemence; but as for those underneath him, instead of paying their worship to the Deity of the place, they were most of them bowing and cur∣tefying
<PB N="63" REF="61"/>to one another; and a great number of them fall asleep.</P>
<P>Whether these were the real thoughts of those roy∣al strangers, I will not take upon me to answer. But what wonder is it that such savage kings, whose dwellings are in huts and thickets, should form such wild notions of this prodigious structure,
<PB N="64" REF="62"/>when we ourselves, who see it daily, are filled with astonishment at the magni∣tude and grandeur of this glorious building; and how such a work could be performed by mortal hands!</P>
<P>WE shall now proceed to examine the particular curiosities of this church.</P>

<PB N="65" REF="63"/>
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Of the fine statue of the late Queen <HI>ANNE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BEfore the west front of this grand Cathedral, is a spacious yard; in which, upon a lofty pe∣destal, stands the effigy of the late queen Anne; with four supporters, represent∣ing those dominions in her title.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="64"/><FIGURE>
<HEAD>QUEEN ANNE.</HEAD>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="65"/>She has her crown upon her head; the scepter in her right hand, and the globe in her left: her dress is very rich, and the work∣manship of it exceeding curious.</P>
<P>On her right hand is Britannia; who appears with a very lovely and chearful countenance: she has a crown of laurel upon her head; a spear in her right hand, and her left
<PB N="68" REF="66"/>reaching to the royal arms in the front of the pede∣stal.</P>
<P>On her left hand is France: she seems much dejected, very thoughtful, and in a languishing state. Her right hand rests upon a truncheon, and her left holds a crown, which lies down in her lap. She is clothed with a very rich robe, adorned with flower de lis; and upon her head
<PB N="69" REF="67"/>she has a warrior's cap, or helmet.</P>
<P>Behind the queen is Ireland, with her harp in her lap: her looks are amiable and pleasant.</P>
<P>The fourth is America, in the habit of her coun∣try; her body being al∣most naked: she has upon her head a crown of cu∣rious feather, a bow in her left hand, and a qui∣ver of arrows on her back:
<PB N="70" REF="68"/>she has the head of an Eu∣ropean under her foot, with an arrow sticking in it; supposed to have been just shot from her bow. There is likewise an allegator creeping from beneath her feet; being an animal very common in some parts of America, and which lives both on the land and in the water.</P>
<P>The queen's, and all the other figures, are of
<PB N="71" REF="69"/>fine Italian, statuary mar∣ble; the pedestal of vein∣ed marble.</P>
<P>The former were all cut out of one solid, rough block of marble, which was taken by one of our English ships, during the late war, in its passage from Leghorn to France; and was designed for the effigy of Lewis the fourteenth, on horseback.</P>
<P>The carver was the late
<PB N="72" REF="70"/>ingenious Mr. Francis Bird.</P>
<P>The foot of the pedestal is encircled with three marble steps; and the whole encompassed with beautiful, strong, iron pa∣lisades.</P>
<P>This royal statue, on account of its grand sup∣porters, fines pedestal, and curious workmanship, is esteemed superior to all others in Europe.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="73" REF="71"/>
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Of the west front of St. Paul's.</HEAD>
<P>MY young readers hav∣ing satisfy'd their cu∣riosities in examining the queen's statue, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> from thence they have a full view of this grand church, whrer they may behold the beauty and majesty of the whole, and the just
<PB N="74" REF="72"/>symmetry of all its parts.</P>
<P>Observe first, the twelve large pillars which support the portico, each four feet thick, and eight and forty in height, of the Corin∣thian order.</P>
<P>Second, the eight ebove, which support the pedi∣ment, of the Composite, or Roman order; each three feet and a half thick, and about thirty four feet in height.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="73"/>See in the large trian∣gular pediment a lively re∣presentation of St. Paul's conversion in his journey to Damascus, carved in relievo, by the ingenious hand of the late Mr. Bird; the history of which my young readers will see hereaster.</P>
<P>Over the pitch or too of this pediment, is the figure of St. Paul wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sword in his hand, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="76" REF="74"/>his right hand is St. Peter with a cock; and on his left, St. James.</P>
<P>In the front of the two losty and beautiful towers, are the four Evangelists: In the north, St. Matthew with an angel, and St. Mark with a lion. In the south, St. Luke with an ox, and St. John with an eagle.</P>
<P>These two towers are each adorn'd with circular ranger of columns, of the
<PB N="77" REF="75"/>Corinthian order, with domes on the upper part, and on the top of each a gilded pine apple.</P>
<P>In the south tower is the famours large clock, the bell of which weighs four ton and four hundred and four pounds; and its sound may be heard at five or six miles distance. The work of this clock is large and curious: it is kept in ex∣cellent good order, and ge∣nerally
<PB N="78" REF="76"/>nerally carries the hour of the day very exectly; a skilful person being ap∣pointed to look after it for that purpose.</P>
<P>Observe likewife the fine carvings, and other rich embellishments, over the whole front of this noble structure.</P>
<P>And lastly, you ascend to the great door by twen∣ty four spacious stone steps; the first ten of which
<PB N="79" REF="77"/>extend in width above for∣ty yards each, and the other fourteen full thirty six yards.</P>
<P>The door case is white marble: and over the en∣trance is cut in relievo the history of St. Paul preach∣ing to the Bereans. It consists of a group of nine sigures besides that of St. Paul, with books, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> These Bereans were a sort of people ingenous and
<PB N="80" REF="78"/>mild, and who spent great part of their time in read∣ing the Scriptures, observ∣ing whether what Paul taught was agreeable with what the Scriptures say of the Messias: and many of whom, from his preach∣ing, chearfully embraced the faith. <HI>Acts</HI> xvii. 11.</P>
<P>Under the arch on the right hand, in a pannel, is St. Paul's imprisonment; and on the left hand in the
<PB N="81" REF="79"/>pannel, his preaching to the Athenians, with some other scripture stories, all neatly carved in stone, by the same hand as the con∣version.</P>
<P>My young readers will find the history of St. Paul's imprisonment in the six∣teenth chapter of the <HI>Acts,</HI> and his preaching to the Athenians in the seven∣teenth chapter, both beau∣tifully related.</P>

<PB N="82" REF="80"/>
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Of the north portico of St. Paul's.</HEAD>
<P>THE ascent to the north portico is by twelve circular steps of black marble: The dome of the portico is support∣ed and adorn'd with six very spacious columns of the Corinthian order. A∣bove the door-case is a
<PB N="83" REF="81"/>large urn, with festoons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> over this is a large pediment, where are the royal arms with the rega∣lia, supported by two an∣gels, with each a palm∣branch in their hands; un∣der whose feet appear the figures of the lion and uni∣corn; and over the pedi∣ment; on the top of this north front, are the effigies of five Apostles, carved in stone.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="8" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="84" REF="82"/>
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> Of the south portico of St. Paul's.</HEAD>
<P>YOU ascend to the south portico by twen∣ty five steps, the ground on this side of the church being lower than that on the norsh: The portico is supported with six grand losty columns, like those of the west an north fronts;
<PB N="85" REF="83"/>and is in most other re∣spects like the latter.</P>
<P>In the pediment over it is the figure of a phoenix, with her wings expanded, arising out of the flames; which emblem signifies, a new church arising out of the old one; under which is the word RESURGAM; that is, <HI>I shall rise again.</HI></P>

<P>RESURGAM.</P>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="85"/>On the top of the pedi∣ment is the effigy of St. Andrew, and those of two other saints on each hand of him.</P>
<P>These five figures, with those on the north and west fronts, represent the four Evangelists, and the rest of the Apostles. They bear in their hands the se∣veral instruments whereby they suffer'd death; or such remarkable ensigns as
<PB N="88" REF="86"/>allude to some important incident of their lives.</P>
<P>These images are each about eleven feet high, and their pedestals about four feet: they were all carv'd by the late Mr. Bird, be∣fore mention'd, and are reckon'd to be well done.</P>

<DIV3 N="9" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="89" REF="87"/>
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> Of what is remarkable in going up the cupola, ar top of St. Paul's.</HEAD>
<P>HAving examin'd what is most curious on the outside of St. Paul's, I shal next endeavour to as∣cend the cupola; and in my journey to the top of it, take notice of what I meet with most worthy of
<PB N="90" REF="88"/>my young readers atten∣tion.</P>
<P>To go up St. Paul's, you must enter a door at the south side, which stands open all the day long for that purpose.</P>
<P>After you have ascended a few steps, you come to a door which will not open till <HI>each person pays Two∣pence.</HI></P>
<P>The whole number of steps to the upper gallery
<PB N="91" REF="89"/>is five hundred and thirty four; of which the first two hundred and sixty are so exceeding easy, that a child might go up them; they being but about four or five inches deep.</P>
<P>The other two hundred and seventy four steps are pretty steep, and in many places, from the large stone gallery to the upper galle∣ry, very dark; so that one person can scarce discern another.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="90"/>In this place we have a glimmering sight of such prodigious works in iron, stone, and timber, which hold together the dome, cupola, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that it is im∣possible to convey an idea of it to my readers: And though these amasing works are very curious to see, yet my young masters and misses must not by any means venture them∣selves here without a guide.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="91"/>The iron gallery on the top of the cupola, is the highest any one is suffer'd to go; above that are the lantern, ball and cross; to the top of which, from the gallery just mention'd, is sixty four feet; and the passage thither by ladders, very difficult and danger∣ous to ascend.</P>
<P>From this gallery, in fine clear weather, we may agreeably observe the vast
<PB N="94" REF="92"/>extent of this great city and suburbs; the great number of churches, stee∣ples, publick buildings and houses that present them∣selves, which way soever we turn our eyes; as also the ships in the river, that look like a huge forest, and the vessels, boats, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> spread allover the Thames. Here likewise we have a delightful prospect of the country, for many miles round about.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="10" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="95" REF="93"/>
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. X.</HI> Of the whispering-gallery, and fine paintings with∣in the cupola.</HEAD>
<P>IN your return from the top of St. Paul's, you will be ask'd to see the whispering-gallery, which will cost <HI>Two-pence each person.</HI></P>
<P>This gallery is a very great curiosity: 'Tis a
<PB N="96" REF="94"/>large circle, which runs round the bottom of the inside of the dome, of about an hundred and for∣ty three feet in diameter, or cross the widest part: 'tis rail'd in with iron of very fine workmanship, gilt with gold. The walls all around are painted and gilded with great beauty: but the greatest curiosity of all is the whispering-place; where, leaning your
<PB N="97" REF="95"/>head against the wall, you may easily hear all that is said, though it be ever so low, and at the most dis∣tant place from you in the gallery: which affords great matter of surprize and innocent diversion to all young persons who come to amuse themselves with this curiosity.</P>
<P>Here you have the best view of the eight pieces of history on the inside of the
<PB N="98" REF="96"/>dome, painted by the late Sir James Thornhill, with inimitable art and beauty.</P>
<P>The first represents the conversion of St. Paul. <HI>Acts</HI> ix. 4.</P>
<P>The second, Elymas the sorcerer struck with blindness. <HI>Acts</HI> xiii 2.</P>
<P>Third, the priest of Jupiter, offering sacrifice to Paul and Barnabas. <HI>Acts</HI> xiv. 15.</P>
<P>Fourth, the jaylor con∣verted. <HI>Acts</HI> xvi. 30.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="97"/>Fifth, Paul preaching at Athens. <HI>Acts</HI> xvii. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XI.</HI> Of the conversion of St. Paul.</HEAD>
<P>ST. PAUL, before his conversion, having been principally concern'd in the death of St. Ste∣phen, and his bloody mind not satisfied with this cru∣elty, threatens nothing less than prisons and death to the Christians wherever
<PB N="102" REF="100"/>he found them. And to qualify himself the better for the execution of this bloody purpose, he goes to the high priest to enlarge his commission: and hav∣ing obtain'd power to seise all Christians, and send them bound to Jerusalem to be try'd, he immediate∣ly sets out for Damascus to put it in practice: but whilst he was on the road, entertaining himself with
<PB N="103" REF="101"/>the bloody prospect, God, in mercy to him, and those he went to persecute, takes him off from his wicked design: a bright shining cloud incompassed him, which struck him with great terror, as at the pre∣sence of God, and threw him prostrate on the ground, where as he lay he heard a voice out of it, saying unto him. <HI>Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou
<PB N="104" REF="102"/>me?</HI> This increas'd his amazement: and being desirous to know the meaning of this vision, he asks, <HI>Who art thou, Lord!</HI> The voice reply'd, <HI>I am</HI> JESUS, <HI>whom thou prese∣cutest:</HI> It is in vain for thee to resist the decrees of providence, therefore be no longer disobedient, but hearken to the com∣mands that shall be given thee. At this Saul, full
<PB N="105" REF="103"/>of fear and trembling, cri∣ed out, 'Lord, instruct me what thou wouldst have me to do:' The voice returned, 'Go to Damascus, and there thou shalt know my will.</P>
<P>Those who attended Paul on this journey, were struck dumb with fear and amazement, wondring that, they should hear a voice, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e no man speakings therefore taking up Saul,
<PB N="106" REF="104"/>they led him to the city; and by this miraculous vision he was converted to the Christian saith.</P>

But Paul, in an holy rage, cast∣ing
<PB N="109" REF="107"/>his eyes on Elymas, this expressed his abhor∣rence; 'O thou vile Sor∣cerer, like the Devil, by whom thou workest, thou art an enemy to all good∣ness; wilt thou persist in sorcery, in defiance of the faith of Christ, which comes armed with a much greater power of miracles, than those to which thou falsly pretendest? Thou shall soon see the venge∣ane
<PB N="110" REF="108"/>of heaven upon thee; for thou that perversly holdest out against the light of the gospel, shalt lose thy sight, which by the immediate power of God shall be taken from thee for some time.

<P>When they saw it, they concluded this miracle could not be done but by the immediate presence of the Deity; and therefore running about in great confusion, they cried out,
<PB N="114" REF="112"/>that the gods had put on human shape, and were come down among them.</P>
<P>They look'd on Barna∣bas as Jupiter, the supreme God; and Paul, as Mer∣cury, the interpreter of the will of the gods, be∣cause he spoke more than Barnabas.</P>
<P>But as soon as this mi∣racle came to the ear of the priest of Jupiter, he came to Paul and Barna∣bas,
<PB N="115" REF="113"/>bringing oxen with garlands of flowers; being such victims as they offer∣ed to the gods they wor∣shiped, intending to offer sacrifice to the Apostles: but they abhorring such idolatry, rent their gar∣ments; endeavouring by arguments drawn from some of the plainest in∣stances of nature, such as day, night, summer, win∣ter, <HI>&amp;c</HI> to convince them,
<PB N="116" REF="114"/>that worship was due only to that God who was the author of all those bles∣sings; yet this discourse, so pressingly urg'd by the Apostles, could scarce re∣strain those poor idolaters from sacrificing to them.</P>
