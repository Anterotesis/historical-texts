<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>EYDEY! Here's a house with a witness! Two o'clock and not a soul stirring yet—what a charming thing it is to be quality! for then, one need never do any one thing like the rest of the world—lie a-bed all day, sit up all night, spend an estate without ever having one, run in debt to every body, pay nobody, laugh at every body, despise every body, and cuckold every body. Oh, what a delightful thing it is to be quality!—But I wonder Mr. Cha∣peau is not up yet, he does not use to be so
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>late. A sweet fellow—has more of the man of fashion about him, than any servant in town—I wish I was like him; I strive all I can, but I cannot get his manner. <STAGE>A servant-maid crosses the stage with a pail, &amp;c.</STAGE> Harkee, my dear, is Captain Bevil at home?</P>

<P>Up yet! no, Sir; I believe they are not long gone to bed. Why sure you must be as great a stranger here as I am, to think of find∣ing any one stirring at this time of the day.</P>

<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>A stranger! what then you are a new comer—I don't remember having had the pleasure of seeing you before, my dear.</P>

<P>No, Sir; I have been here but a week; and I don't know yet who it is I live with; Mrs. Sudds, the washerwoman, recommended me; mayhap you may know her.</P>

<P>And here I am, but I have ne'er seen the face of my master since here I've been. I never hears any thing of him, but when he raps at door in the morning, and he is always going to bed, just as I begin to think of getting up—What, perhaps, you want to speak to Mr. Chapeau?</P>
</SP>

<P>Oh, what in the square?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; that's the eldest, the great Squire Bevil; there are three of them—He that lives in St. James's-Square, is, as I told you, the eldest, and has a great fortune; my master studies the law in the Temple, and your master, my dear, is the youngest, and studies nothing at all in the army; he's an officer in the foot guards. I want to know if he's upon duty, can you tell me?</P>

<SPEAKER>CHAPEAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it, indeed! why we were up very late at Almack's last night, and lost all our money. Come, sit down <STAGE>drawing a chair.</STAGE> A damn'd run against us all night long. But, how∣ever, no matter, the worse luck now, the better another time, eh, my little smiling Robin?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, it is to be hoped so, Mr. Chapeau—I think they say that your master has lost consi∣derably of late, has not he?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHAPEAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! we have had the cursedest run of ill luck, that ever people had!—and how to raise money upon earth we don't know; there's not a usurer, not a thief, between this and the Monument, but we have brought to a stand∣still, not a penny will they lend us—I believe—though it is the devil to think of that too—but I believe we must marry somebody; we can't keep our heads above water much longer if we do not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should suppose, Mr. Chapeau, that your master had well nigh spent all his fortune by this time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>CHAPEAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>Spent his fortune! why we did not begin to make a figure, or be at all known in the world, till we had lost all we had.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you don't tell me so!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHAPEAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may stare, but it is very true—We did not begin to have credit, till we had not a farthing left in the world. Ah! Robin, London is the place for credit; pluck up but a good resolution, and you may run in debt as much as you please. Why the trades∣men are all playing as deep a game as our masters, William, bring chocolate.</P>

<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>As one don't drink so confoundedly hard as one used to do, I think there's less occasion for tea in a morning. But pray, what might your master have lost last night?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHAPEAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith I can't justly say. Bob told me, for you must know, we had a little party with him last night, that at one in the morning he was out nine hundred, and kept calling for Rouleaus till past five, and every one quite worn out, so you may guess.</P>
<STAGE>chocolate brought in.</STAGE>
<P>How much do you think I lost last night?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my soul I have no guess—Perhaps a guinea or two.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHAPEAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fifty, or may I never rattle a box again, You must know that young Flimzy, Sir Harry Blackball, and some others, were all ballotted in last night, and we had devilish deep play.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a genteel manner he has!
<STAGE>[Aside.]</STAGE>
Fifty guineas, Mr. Chapeau, why, that will
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>make a horrid hole in your strong box, won't it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHAPEAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>A monstrous one, I can't say but it will, <STAGE>[sipping chocolate.]</STAGE> But you must know—don't take any notice of it though—I have been in keeping some time—A certain married woman that—shall be nameless—whose hus∣band is monstrous rich, and keeps a shop in a certain street—that shall be nameless—You have seen her, my little Robin—a monstrous fine girl—She danced with me at the last mas∣querade—we were both monstrously well dressed
—after which we went to a certain house, that—shall be nameless—The husband is damn'd jealous though, and between you and I, I am afraid he wants to get rid of her; so that of late we are grown more circum∣spect—For though I should like the eclat of a divorce—yet the money at present, the mo∣ney, my little Robin, you know, is conve∣nient,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes, damme—the money to be sure.</P>

<PB N="9" REF="12"/>

<P>O Lord, ay, very well! She was dressed in a muss too—I remember her; why that you told me, the next day, was a wax-chand∣ler's lady in—</P>

<P>Ha! my master's bell; he is awake then, I find—<HI>Toute à l' heure, Monsieur; toute à l' heure.</HI> But what brought you here to day so early, Robin; have you any message?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my master was not sure but his brother might be on guard, so bid me call and ask. He is at his brother's in the square; I fancy he intends coming down here presently—Some family business in hand, I have a no∣tion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHAPEAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, they want to raise the devil, cash, I suppose. I fancy it is confounded low with
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>both of them. That curst place White's is so full of blacks, the poor lads can't keep a far∣thing for them. I suppose they want the oldest to lend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not my master I warrant you, he's a good manager, sticks close to the law. Why he's to be called to the bar next term. Devilish clever he is, an't he?</P>

<P>Yes, Sir, there have been two ladies and an old cloaths man to you, and two thin ugly men asked for my master; I believe they be Jews.</P>

<P>A foolish awkward toad— <STAGE>[Bell rings.]</STAGE> I hear you, Sir—What a damned situation af∣ter all a servant's is, <STAGE>[taking snuff]</STAGE> never at ease, always attending other people's motions—I be∣gin to be monstrous sick of it. As my ma∣ster is pretty near ruined, I take it he will soon either hang or marry himself; I shall then beg leave to retire and enjoy the fruits of my industry, purchase some genteel sine cure, take a snug box in the country, and kill my own mutton.</P>

<P>Yes, Sir, he came from Mr. Bevil's in the square, to know if you were upon duty or not.</P>

<P>My brother, I suppose then, will call here. I am glad of it. I shall have an opportunity of letting him into my situation. <STAGE>[Aside.]</STAGE> Any body else?</P>

<SPEAKER>CHAPEAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>The house maid says, Sir, two Jews were here before I was up, they said they would call again, and one of them left this parcel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. BEVIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, very well, the writings I suppose—Ay, 'tis so—Lay them down—If they come again I must see them—and if any body is with me shew them into my dressing room—There's no living without these Israelites. I am an absolute bankrupt with every christian creature, and if my luck does not change shortly, they will find me out at Duke's Place too.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> HARRY BEVIL.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. BEVIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, George, you are just up I see; you are as regular in your irregularities, I find, as
<PB N="14" REF="17"/>ever—St. James's dial does not better shew the hour of the day, than you do the life of a modern fine gentleman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. BEVIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>St. James's dial, Sir, is not as constant to the sun, as I am to my course of life. But how comes it that you are dressed so soon, are you going to dine with any of your patroniz∣ing attorneys in Chancery-Lane.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. BEVIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I dine at this end of the town, but I have businese on my hands—business which perhaps may occasion business for my pa∣tronizing attorneys, as you are pleased to call them. In short, George, I am upon the brink of matrimoney.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. BEVIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! Why that's the very business I was wanting to open to you. I have thoughts of marrying too—In short, Harry, such is my situation at present that formidable as it may be, I must marry, I must find out a wife, whose fortune may set me afloat again, for faith, as matters go, I am sinking very fast.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. BEVIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the question is, where will you find one that can answer your purpose, I am sure she must be handsome or you will never like
<PB N="15" REF="18"/>her; and her fortune must be very handsome, I am very sure, or it will be of no use to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. BEVIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>In both these points, Harry, I have been lucky enough to succeed—During the course of my sauntring duty in the Park, with the nursery maids, I met with a very fine girl, who has a considerable fortune in her own po∣wer, but may expect a much greater if, she marries with the consent of the old folks—of them I know nothing—The young thing is entirely mine—and I am foolish enough to be in love with her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. BEVIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Simple indeed! And her name is—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. BEVIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>There you must excuse me—I must be surer of carrying my point, before I open my∣self farther, even to you—But what, pray, is your situation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. BEVIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why faith, odd enough, you will say. You have always laughed at me for sticking, so close to the old ladies, but at last I am re∣warded for it. One I have often seen at Lady Matchem's assemblies, has taken, it seems, so violent an inclination to me, that she has
<PB N="16" REF="19"/>made me an offer of her daughter—Tis true I am not acquainted with the girl, I have only seen her at a distance, but she is reckoned hand∣some, and as I am sure her fortune has num∣berless charms, I have made up my mind and am resolved.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. BEVIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>And her name is—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. BEVIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>There you must excuse me. As you said, I must be surer of my point, before I open myself, even to you—Lady Matchem has gi∣ven me the characters of the family, which stand thus—The girl amiable and handsome, with a considerable fortune in her own po∣wer; but as you said of yours, if papa and mama consent, may have a much greater. The father is a man who has all his money in the stocks, and though he lives on this side Temple-Bar, is as ignorant of good company as if he had never removed from Thames-Street: all his time is taken up in listening to news, picking up intelligence, and buying in and selling out accordingly—The mother's only joy is cards and governing her family, which she does with as much authority, as her husband's obstinacy will let her. She has un∣dertaken to open the matter to him, and this afternoon, I am, perhaps, to have the honour of an introduction to him. More I'll tell you when I know more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="17" REF="20"/>
<SPEAKER>G. BEVIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you opened this business yet, to my brother Frank?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. BEVIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not yet. Does he know your plan of ope∣rations?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. BEVIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>No!—I went to him, the other day, with an intention of telling him all, and begging his advice and assistance; but unluckily the con∣versation turning first upon my losses at play, put us both so heartily out of humour, that company coming in, I took the first opportu∣nity of retreating, and have not seen him since. It will be time enough to tell him, when I am a little surer of success. The day wears tho', and I have a great deal of business upon my hands, besides dressing. I am laying some of my burdens upon the tribe of Issachar</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. BEVIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who will take care to exonerate themselves, I warrant. How many Jews may your ho∣hour have in hand now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. BEVIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Umph! why faith, I believe about a round dozen: but if I marry, I will discard them all, and play a more christian kind of game for the future.</P>

<P>Well, well, well, I hear you man; but in the mean time, all I have in the world, the labour of fifty years, is going, going at a blow—Oh! this cursed Spanish war—I am sure we shall have a Spanish war—I always saw it would come to this—I was sure at the time of the peace that we should have a Spa∣nish war one time or other—but pr'ythee man, do cut your story short.</P>

<P>Well, well, to cut the story short, when I ask'd him if he could find out, or guess, what made the ambassador stay at home all night, he told me—</P>

<P>My dear Consol <STAGE>(embracing him)</STAGE> I thank you—that revives me—then hurry into the city as fast as you can, and buy as if the devil was in you; that revives me, that's great news indeed—Gad the news-papers have put me into a devilish fright of late.</P>

If India stock rises six per cent to-morrow, I shall make a great hand of it—But now for this other affair—now for the marriage of my daughter—I am glad I was so fortunate as to get acquaint∣ed with this gentleman—a fine fortune, in parliament, and an oeconomist; three things very much to my mind—If I can but get my confounded wife to agree to it—but she's the devil to deal with—It was lucky I happened to meet with this man, for the women are so agog, now-a-days, that you cant provide too soon for them; and a fine young girl with thirty thousand pounds in her own power, is so tempting an object in this town, that the sooner you can get her married and safe out of your hands the better—Ah!—Now, if I could but double my capital, and bury my wife, <STAGE>(sighs)</STAGE> but there is no such thing as real hap∣piness on this side the grave!</P>

<P>NOW for this wife of mine—I suppose I shall have a fine piece of work with her to make her approve of this match—nay, ten to one, but as I have found out the man, she for that reason only will set herself against the business—but here she comes.

<P>Oh, Mrs. Grub! my dear, how d'ye do—What's the news?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>News! Heavens, Mr. Grub! will you never leave off that filthy vulgar city custom of yours, of asking every body you see for news? news? as if one was a hawker of Lloyd's Chronicle, or the Public Ledger. Now you are removed to this end of the town, why don't you do like the rest of your neighbours: When you are at Rome, do as Rome does, was always the saying of my poor dear brother Sir Tympany Tar Barrel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="27" REF="30"/>
<SPEAKER>GRUB:</SPEAKER>
<P>Your poor dear brother might say what he pleased, but he would never do as I have, leave the city and all his old friends, and be∣gin the world, as it were, over again, only to oblige his wife. You could never get him to stir out of Gutter-Lane.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, hideous! name it not: but if you are at a loss for friends, why don't you do as I do, take pains to make them?—but no—I must do every thing for the honour and credit of our name, and if I did not go about to the watering places in the summer, with my child, and pick up fashionable company, and make a point of playing high at their assemblies in the winter, neither I nor my poor child would have a friend or acquaintance on this side Lud∣gate—Mrs. Deputy this and Mrs. Deputy t'other, and Alderman Goose, and Alderman Gander, pretty creatures to introduce a young lady, with the fortune that Miss Grub will have.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, it is very true, as you say, you have taken great pains about her acquaintance, that's certain—but now you talk of acquaintance, my dear, who d'ye think is dead—Poor Al∣derman Marrowfat.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="28" REF="31"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! the filthy wretch, I'm mighty gla don't—he ought to have died twenty years ago—What was the matter with him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Apoplexy!—eat as hearty a dinner at Gird ler's-Hall, as man could eat, and was dead before he could swallow church and state, stiff before the second toast could go round! Ah! the new paving of the streets killed him—Ah! the fatal effects of luxury! they will never leave their curfed improvements till they have killed us all—But, my dear, there's rare news from the Alley, India stock is mounting every minute.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very glad to hear it, my dear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; I thought you would be glad to hear it; I have just sent Consol to the Alley, to see how matters go—I should have gone myself—but—I—wanted to—open an affair of some importance to you—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. GRUE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, you have always some affair of great importance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay this is one—I have been thinking, my dear, that it was high time we had fixed our daughter, 'tis high time that Emily was mar∣ried.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="29" REF="32"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>You think so, do you? I have thought so any time these three years, and so has Emily too, I fancy—I wanted to talk to you upon the same subject.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>You did! well I declare that's pat enough, he, he, he? I vow and protest I'm pleased at this—why our inclinations do seldom jump to∣gether.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Jump, quotha! no, on my conscience I should wonder they did—and how comes it now to pass? What, I suppose you have been employing some of your brokers, as usual, or, perhaps, advertizing, as you used to do—but I expect to hear no more of those tricks now we are come to this end of the town.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, my dear, this is no such matter, the gentleman I intend—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>You intend!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I intend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs, GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>You intend—what do you presume to dis∣pose of my child without my consent?—Look you, Mr. Grub, as I have always faid, mind
<PB N="30" REF="33"/>your money matters, look to your bulls, and your bears, and your lame ducks, and take care they don't make <HI>you</HI> waddle out of the Alley, as the saying is—but leave to me the management of my child—What! things are come to a fine pass indeed! I suppose you intend to marry the poor innocent to some of your city cronies, your factors, supercargoes, packers and dry∣salters; but, thank my stars, I have washed my hands of them, and I'll have none of them, Mr. Grub; no, I'll have none of them—It never shall be said that after coming to this end of the town, the great Miss Grub was forced to trudge into the city again for a husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, zounds, are you mad, Mrs. Grub!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, you shall find I am not mad, Mr. Grub; that I know how to dispose of my child, Mr. Grub—what, did my poor dear brother leave his fortune to me and my child, and shall she now be disposed of without con∣sulting me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why the devil is in you, certainly! if you will but hear me, you shall be consulted—have I not always consulted you; was I not inclined to please you, to marry my daughter to a lord, and has she not been hawked about till all the peerage of the three kingdoms turn
<PB N="31" REF="34"/>up their noses at you and your daughter?—Did I not treat with my Lord Spindle, my Lord Thoughtless, and my Lord Maukin; and did we not agree, for the first time in our lives, that it would be better to find out a common∣ner for her, as the people of quality only mar∣ry, now-a-days, for a winter or so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, we did so—and who pray is the proper person to find out a match for her?—who, but her mother, Mr. Grub, who goes into company with no other view, Mr. Grub—who flatters herself that she is no contemp∣tible judge of mankind, Mr. Grub—Yes, Mr. Grub, I know mankind as well as any woman on earth, Mr, Grub.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I believe from my soul, Mrs. Grub.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who then but me should have the disposal of her—and very well I have disposed of her—I have got her a husband in my eye—</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>You got her a husband.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes I have got her a husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRUB,</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, no, Mrs. Grub, that will never do—What the vengeance, have I been toiling
<PB N="32" REF="35"/>upwards of fifty years—up early, down late, shop-keeper, and house-keeper, made a great fortune, which I could never find in my heart to enjoy. And now, when all the comfort I have in the world, the settlement of my child is in agitation—shall I not speak, shall I not have leave to approve of her hus∣band?</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hey day! You are getting into your tan∣trums, I see.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, did I not leave the city, every friend in the world with whom I used to pass an evening—did I not to please you take this house here, nay did I not make the damnedest fool of myself, by going to learn to come in and out of a room with the grown gentlemen in Cow-lane—Did I not put on a sword too at your desire, and had I not like to have broke my neck down stairs by its getting be∣tween my legs, at that diabolical lady what d'ye call 'ems route! and did not all the foot∣men and chairmen laugh at me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>And well they might truly. An obstinate old fool—</P>

<P>Ay, ay, that may be, but I will have my own way—I'll give my danghter to the man
<PB N="33" REF="36"/>I like—I'll have no sir this, nor lord t'other—I'll have no fellow with a waist down to his knees, and a stirt like a monkey's jacket—with a hat not so big as its button, his shoe buckles upon his toes, and a queuë thicker than his leg!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>To whom?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, to whom, I say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where, and when was it?—Who is he?—Tell me all about it this instant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was there ever such an artful baggage!—Oh, I am the most miserable man in the world! the most miserable man in the world!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>After all my pains!—After all the money I have spent in going to Tunbridge and Bath, to Margate and Harrowgate, fresh water and salt water!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Mrs. Grub, Mrs. Grab!—This is the blessed effect of your jauntings and journies—with as snug a box upon Clapham common—which I think by far the finest part of Eng∣land, and every thing handsome about you, you could not be contented—and because there's not a foolish body of quality now a-days, lives a summer in their own houses, as they ought to do, you must be driving away to
<PB N="41" REF="44"/>all the watering places too; and slap dash, all on a sudden, when I least think on't, away I am hy'd the devil knows where—ha!—then, such plungings and pumpings, such divings and dippings, as if you had been bit by all the mad dogs in the kingdom!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dearest father, hear me—chance brought me acquainted with a gentleman, who is, I am certain, if you did but know him, the man in the world you would wish me to have—a man, amiable in the highest degree.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, very likely truly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, a very pretty fellow to be sure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I must own, he has infinuated him∣self into my heart, and made on it the most indelible impression—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very fine, truly! I say impression, indeed!—after all our indulgence—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay after all our indulgence—who was ever better dressed at my lord-mayor's balls—But who in the devil's name is he?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, who is he? speak, who is he? what's his, name, urchin?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="42" REF="45"/>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>His name is—Bevil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>What!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I said his name is Bevil.
<STAGE>(In a fright.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bevil! what, Bevil of Lincolnshire?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Bevil of Lincolnshire?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I think I have heard him talk of go∣ing into Lincolnshire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tol lol derol!—My dear child, my dear wife—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear daughter—My sweet Mr. Grub!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am the happiest man in the world, the happiest man in the world!—Who could have thought it!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>What can all this mean!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, my dear child, you have surely inhe∣rited all the penetration of your mother, with
<PB N="43" REF="46"/>that strong likeness of my poor dear brother—Why, my dear, that Mr. Bevil is the very identical person we have had in view for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, my dear mama, is it possible!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, by the lord is it, so say no more, but kiss your own dear papa, you sweet little che∣rubim.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, my dear, it is very odd he should be acquainted with the child, and never once hint it to us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, not at all. I see thro' it, I see thro' it; he is a notable one, I see; he wants to have all our consents separately, that he may be the more certain of our affections.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, it must be so: and did he never say that he had met with your papa or me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never, I am very much surprized at it, but I am so happy in your concurrence with my wishes, that it almost overcomes me. This sure, is the oddest event that ever happened.</P>
<STAGE>(Aside, and walking up the stage.)</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs.GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, my dear, I think we may say, that we are completely happy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="44" REF="47"/>
<SPEAKER>GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my dear, we are indeed—Such a dear, good child, and such a respectable son-in-law—The baggage knows how to chuse herself a husband—he, he, he!—He's as handsome a black man, I think, as ever I saw—.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Black, Mr. Grub! why, surely, your eyes begin to fail you—he's as handsome a fair man, indeed, as ever I saw.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fair!—No, no, no; I know complexions better than that comes to.—He's black, I tell you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>But he is fair, I tell you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, I say, he is black.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G R U B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Black!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>As a dot of ink.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, child, Emily, my dear, what do you say, is he a black or a fair man?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>In my opinion, he is neither one nor the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="45" REF="48"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, it does not signify disputing, as he will be here presently, we shall see which of us is right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here!—How do you know that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>I appointed him to call on me this evening, and the hour draws nigh.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I appointed him to be here between six and seven, too!—he, he, he!—Our in∣clinations have jumped most marvellously today.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I received a note from him, about two hours since, telling me that he would be here about seven. I must own, thinking you would be out of the way, I permitted him to come here, for the first time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>And he never said a syllable to either of us, and pretended not to know us, ha, ha, ha! that's very good!— <STAGE>(looks at his watch)</STAGE>—but it's time he was come;—tho' perhaps the busi∣ness of the house may detain him—I don't be∣lieve they are up yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mn. GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>The house! what house?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>The House of Commons—You know he is a member of parliament, I suppose, child.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="46" REF="49"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not I, indeed, I know no such thing, I know he's not in parliament.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I tell you he is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's a very pretty story, indeed. Emily, child, do speak to your father, and don't let him expose his ignorance and obstinacy so un∣mercifully.—Is not he studying the law in the temple, my dear?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't he live in St. James's Square, my sweet?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, indeed, papa; he is an officer in the guards, and lives in Pall-mall.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>The girl is distracted, sure, and will distract us too, I believe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never heard such confounded nonsense. You are both mad, I believe.</P>
</SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERVANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>A gentleman below desires to speak to my master.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, he's come, I suppose—now we shall see who's a fool—who's obstinate, and who's ig∣norant. Where is he?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="47" REF="50"/>
<SPEAKER>SERVANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shewed him into the parlour, Sir.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.]</STAGE>

<P>O very well, I'll go down and shew him up. Now we shall see, now we shall know who he is, and what he is.</P>

<P>Madam, the gentleman you expected is come, and in your drssing-room waiting for you.</P>

<P>Yes, yes, I know he is come; but he is be∣low stairs, your master is just gone down to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAID.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Madam, that is somebody come in just now; the gentleman you mean, Ma'am has been here this half hour. As you and my ma∣ster seemed to be at high words, I did not chuse to come in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, then it seems your papa has got some∣body else upon business with him. I'll go to Mr. Bevil, and make my apologies to him for detaining him so long.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.]</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is, surely, the strangest affair that ever happened. What can they mean? I have no idea of it. I think Mr. Bevil would never enter privately into engagements with them, and not mention
<PB N="48" REF="51"/>it to me—but I am glad it's come to this crisis, the sooner it's over the better; I am heartily tired of these violent disputes and wrangles every minute.</P>

<P>Madam, the gentleman's come, he is in the blue room, and nobody has seen him.</P>

<P>George here—nay then the mystery's out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. BEVIL, <HI>aside.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>This is very ridiculous, faith.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>The most impudent fellow I ever saw! Pray, Sir, give me leave to ask you, who, in the de∣vil's name, are you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. BEVIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I have the honour to call myself Bevil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Sir, do you know either of these gen∣tlem?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. BEVIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! impostors, Madam, impostors! I am the only Bevil breathing. Ha, ha, ha.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. BEVIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, Sir, I'll explain this mystery: We are brothers; we have all been so close in this
<PB N="52" REF="55" MS="y"/>business that we have unavoidably ran counter to one another—and as George seems to have plann'd his operations with more propriety than we did, and made sure of the lady's affec∣tions, with pleasure I shall quit the field, and bow to his superior merit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. BEVIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear George, you know me too well too doubt of my being in the same sentiments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear, what do you think of this business?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I think, my dear, that as we can't help ourselves, we may as well make the best on't. What's done can't be undone, and it's well it's no worse, as was always the saying of my poor dear brother, Sir Tympany.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Egad I believe he was right, and I may as well make the best on't; for if I don't give' her away, she'll throw herself away. But I hope you won't follow the example of the great; there is such work among them!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. BEVIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Sir, don't nourish such strange preju∣dices. The great have their follies, tis true, but they have also their virtues, as well as the rest of mankind; and there are among them many shining objects of inmitation: we should consider, Sir, that the Greatest Couple in the nation is the best and happiest in it.</P>
