<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE following play was written above three years ago, and was soon after shewn to some of the principal performers of both houses. It took its rise from Miss EL∣LIOT'S being advised to revive <HI>The Country Wife</HI> for her benefit the first season of her engagement at Covent-Garden theatre. That play, upon a review of it, appeared inad∣missible on account of the obscenity which discolours the whole. The author, or rather the compiler of the en∣suing scenes, undertook to alter WYCHERLEY's play for Miss ELLIOT against the following winter; but hearing, in the mean time, that Mr. BICKERSTAFF had employed himself upon one of WYCHERLEY's pieces, he made it his business to see that gentleman, lest this writer should inter∣fere with a plan already pre-occupied. He found that the PLAIN DEALER had been Mr. BICKERSTAFF's object, and that there was no danger of clashing with the scheme of any other author. Upon a closer examination, therefore, of <HI>The Country Wife,</HI> it was thought proper to desert it in∣tirely, and to resort to MOLIERE, the original master whom WYCHERLEY copied. The celebrated comedy of <HI>L'Ecole de Femmes</HI> appeared too thin of business, consisting mostly in narrative. To supply that deficiency the design occurred of making MOLIERE himself supply the requisite materials; and for this purpose L'ETOURDIE and L'Ecole DE MARIS were called in as auxiliaries. Upon this idea the play was soon finished, and it consists of characters, situations, and business, from those three plays, interwoven into one fable, with as much skill as a little leisure in the summer time would permit. With the professed design of condensing what appeared to be the best of three performances into one play, it was deemed unnecessary to suppress any one scene of true nature, merely because the author of <HI>High Life below Stairs,</HI> and some other English writers, might occasionally be <HI>tracked in the snow of Moliere.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="3"/>The play, when finished, was given to Miss ELLIOT, and it so happened, that she had no opportunity of producing it till this season. When in September last, her bargain both for herself and the play was in agitation with Mr. BEARD, the author of these sheets was astonished to hear that <HI>The Country Girl</HI> was actually in rehearsal at Drury Lane, and that the parts had been given out in the summer, nay, <HI>as fast as they were written.</HI> This, it must not be dissembled, looked like a <HI>design of forestalling the market;</HI> especially as it was understood, that Miss ELLIOT and the SCHOOL FOR GUARDIANS, had been offered the spring before to the ma∣nager of Drury Lane, <HI>upon his own terms.</HI> A remonstrance was immediately made to Mr. GARRICK, purporting that he, who had long been a manager of a successful theatre, was going to enter into a competition with a young actress for the pro∣fits of a play. A meeting ensued, where a gentleman of the first character for probity and genius, was so obliging as to be the arbitrator. Mr. GARRICK there protesting, that he never heard of Miss ELLIOT's play till within a few days; it was thereupon determined, that it was, in that case, an accidental clashing, but that a design of <HI>forestalling</HI> would have been illiberal and unhandsome. This last point of ho∣nour Mr. GARRICK seemed to learn upon this occasion.</P>
<P>Both parties were, in consequence, left to pursue their own interests. And now the present writer will dismiss THE SCHOOL FOR GUARDIANS, after saying, that he com∣posed it with the most disinterested principle; and that, if it prove in any degree conducive to the service of a young actress, or the public entertainment, he has all the reward he ever proposed to himself.</P>
<P>N. B. <HI>An entire scene in the second act, page 30. has been omitted since the first representation, and would have been discarded from this edition, but that the greatest part of the play was printed, before it was acted.</HI></P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Spoken by MISS ELLIOT.</BYLINE>
<SP>
<L>MAY I intrude upon your patience for a minute?</L>
<L>Ladies and gentlemen, before the opening of the play,</L>
<L>Just to excuse an accident, which, I hope has no mischief in it,</L>
<L>I fain, if you'll permit, a word or two would say.</L>
<L>I hope you'll not be angry; but we've got no prologue for to night;</L>
<L>And so I thought it was best to come and tell ye all the truth downright.</L>
<L>I went to Mr. Poet, and I spoke to him all I could,</L>
<L>But he said he had not leisure, tho' I know it's in his power if he would.</L>
<L>"A prologue, ma'am," says he!—"Yes, Sir, a prologue if you please."</L>
<L>And then I did so entreat the man, and beg, and pray, and teaze.</L>
<L>I told him, "You know, Sir, what a miserable plight we all are in,</L>
<L>To frown upon the performers, when pit, box, and gallery begin;</L>
<L>Whu—go the catcalls—dub—dub—dub—each dreadful critick's stick</L>
<L><HI>Prólog</HI>'— throw him over—won't ye ha some orange chips—<HI>Prólôgué</HI>—Cries o' London—Musick!"</L>
<L>All this and more I said, but he, determin'd still,</L>
<L>In formal fustian thus declar'd his will.</L>
<L>"Oft have I tried"<STAGE>[seems puzzled]</STAGE>—something about his stile,</L>
<L>And how he felt the Town's indulgent smile.</L>
<L>"Were I again to try my scanty vein,</L>
<L>I'd beg protection for the feeble strain.</L>
<L>But then to sue—he paus'd and rubb'd his head—</L>
<L>To sue—when fam'd MOLIERE the stage doth tread,</L>
<L>Were to prophane the manes of the dead.</L>
<L>MOLIERE, of old, and still with rapture seen,</L>
<L>Was legislator of the comic scene.</L>
<L>To bid his SIMPLE GIRL assert the stage,</L>
<L>And if she pleases, strive to mend the age,</L>
<L>This was my motive;—this my only aim;</L>
<L>Heedless of gain!—no candidate for fame!</L>
<L><PB REF="5"/>An audience will weigh all in equal scales,</L>
<L>For justice, and not party, there prevails."</L>
<L>Thus spoke Mr.Poet, and then with long steps march'd away;</L>
<L>And now I am left alone to apologize for offering you this night's play.</L>
<L>We'll strive to make you laugh, if our aim be not perverted;</L>
<L>Pray, how d'ye find yourselves?—Are ye in good humour, and willing to be diverted?</L>
<L>If you approve,</L>
<L>The <HI>Rostiad Scribbler</HI> then no more I'll dread,</L>
<L>Who points his malice at a woman's head!</L>
<L>Who drop by drop his venom doth distil,</L>
<L>While MOTHER-DULLNESS guides the hireling's quill.</L>
<L>Lull'd in her lap, strange wonders he descries,</L>
<L>And TERENCE seems—a Frenchman to his eyes!</L>
<L>From thence he issues soul decrees on plays,</L>
<L>Adorns with scandal, and lampoons with praise.</L>
<L>One smile from you defeats the sland'rer's aim;</L>
<L>His calumny, like your APPLAUSE, is fame.</L>
<L>From your applause our mimic glories rise;</L>
<L>In pleasing you my whole ambition lies.</L>

<L>Pray, may I, ladies, touch your modish life,</L>
<L>And shew good sense and fashion there at strife?</L>
<L>"Oh! do Miss Elliot, says a prude with spite,</L>
<L>Pull'em to pieces; bring their faults to light;</L>
<L>Pulling to pieces is my dear delight."</L>
<L>Why then each fair one seems a diff'rent creature</L>

<L>Proud of defects, FLIRTILLA swims along,</L>

<L>Lady CAMILLA, form'd to seize the rein,</L>

<L>In London sickens with dissembled airs,</L>

<L>Nature's best gifts we all with pride disclaim;</L>
<L>We lisp, we totter, deaf, and blind, and lame.</L>
<L>The tongue indeed we women ne'er confine;</L>
<L>—Scandal's too dear a pleasure to resign.</L>
<L>Scandal, and cards, tea, mirth, and spleen, a ball,</L>
<L>Comus!—the monkey too!—and there's the life of'all.</L>
<L>A life of whim!—till from she faded eye,</L>
<L>And wither'd form, the trembling graces fly.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>There's a true picture!—how do ye like it, ladies?</L>
<L>How is the light? and how do ye think the shade is?</L>
<L>A copy hence our simple girl may make;</L>
<L>Unless she should this wiser counsel take,</L>
<L>Be rul'd by reason for your beauty's sake.</L>
<L>Reason still gives to radiant eyes their grace,</L>
<L><HI>Warren's imperial milk</HI>—for ev'ry face.</L>
<L>Beauty, ye fair, may forge the lover's chain;</L>

<STAGE><HI>Enter Sir</HI> Theodore, and Brumpton.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Theodore.</SPEAKER>
<P>BUT I won't be told; I won't reason about it; I won't be answered; I won't hear a word.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brumpton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have done, Sir—you have proved it to demonstration, by the same sort of logick that was used by one of the wits of Charles the lld's. time to his dog, when he was too lazy to beat him, "I wish you well married, and settled in the country"—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Theodore.</SPEAKER>
<P>There again now; don't enrage me; I have some whimsical humours about me, that let me tell you, Sir—and I can be very peremptory, if I please—What? when my neighbour Strickland and I have agreed the matter!—a young lady with a fair fortune in hand, and seven hundred a year in expect∣ancy, as pretty a reversion as any in Hampshire!— and am I now to be told, "She does not suit my taste,—she is not handsome?" and so I am to be
<PB N="2" REF="11"/>
wasting my breath with you, about a complection, a nose, and a lip!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brumpton.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you would but leave those matters to me, Sir—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Theodore.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I tell you no; I won't leave those matters to you—Beauty is the last thing I desire to see in my family—Your mother, peace be to her, was as ugly a woman as you shall see in a summer's day; and what do you think I married her for?— for your good, Sir—for the good of my children—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brumpton.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, Sir, which of ye does this side-box face of mine take after?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Theodore.</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall take nothing after me, that you may depend upon, unless you prove obedient to my will and pleasure.—I'll not leave you a foot of land—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brumpton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope you'll live to enjoy it yourself, Sir—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Theodore.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll give my fortune to found a new college, where it is not wanted—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brumpton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope you'll live to enjoy it yourself, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Theodore.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll cut you off with a shilling to buy you an halter—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brumpton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope you'll live to enjoy it yourself, Sir—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Theodore.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope I shall, tho' you say it with a sort of a dry look between just and earnest—But don't talk to me of beauty again; I never knew any good come of it; beauty is like fine fruit, only fit to draw a parcel of flies about it—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brumpton.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so I must set my teeth on edge with crab-tree apples—But where would be the harm, Sir, if purely for the good of my family, I were to marry a lady of some share of beauty, only just to cross the strain a little, and settle a shape and a feature upon the issue of our marriage?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Theodore.</SPEAKER>
<P>Settle your wife's fortune upon 'em—Look ye, Sir;—my purse strings will never open,—
<PB N="3" REF="12"/>
not a shilling of my money shall you touch, till you pay your respects to Miss Strickland—now you know my resolution—What a graceless look there is! ruin yourself if you will—follow your own courses, Sir,—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brumpton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your most obedient very humble ser∣vant, Sir,—you may depend that—I shall chuse for myself—Brisk! why don't you answer, sirrah!—Why Brisk!—</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Brisk.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brumpton.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have been pretty handsomely lec∣tured here this morning, Brisk!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brisk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, we have had wherewithal to edify by—I suppose, we shall lie at Tom Tilbury's at Bag∣shot to-night, Sir—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brumpton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brisk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tom Tilbury's, Sir—only just to break the neck of our journey, for I suppose now, you'll drop all thoughts of this other lady—I forget her name—Ay! miss Mary Ann Richley—She has no chance now, I reckon, Sir—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brumpton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you senseless numskull!—as sure as I am Charles Brumpton, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> she shall be Mrs. Brumpton; and upon the death of my very good fa∣ther, she'll be a baronet's lady, that's all—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brisk.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet there is some truth in what Sir Theodore says—Beauty is but a frail perishable sort of a commodity; and if you are disinherited for it, the lady's charms will not pay your poor servant, Brisk, his board-wages; a feature, or a smile can't go to market; a pawn-broker will lend nothing upon the tip of an ear: though indeed she may mortgage her person; but that I take it will be for her own advan∣tage; we shall get nothing but a comely pair of horns by it, Sir, with submission—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brumpton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you talk a frothy kind of nothing at a tolerable rate, Brisk—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>Brisk.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have shewn you one side of the medal, now behold the reverse, Sir—When you marry an ugly woman, there is no great pleasure in beholding her, and to be sure when you look at her, you'll be apt to murmur to yourself—for all purposes of joy one may cut as desirable an object out of an old tapestry-hanging—but then the woman has some valuable parchments, such as leases, bonds, and mortgages; and I, Sir, shall live in tolerable plight with you, which to so good a master—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brumpton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Leave prating, sirrah, and do as I or∣dered you—put on your farmer's dress, go directly to the object I adore—let her know you are come from her guardian in the country, and have his or∣ders to take her home under your care—convey her safe to my arms, and I shall reward you—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brisk.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brumpton.</SPEAKER>
<P>No arguing with me—about it streight—</P>

<SPEAKER>Brisk.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know how many blanketings and blows I have suffered in your service, Sir—</P>
</SP>

<P>Sirrah, no words—go and see who's at the door—</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>You have marred many an excellent plot of mine, Sir—you know you cannot help meddling, when I undertake a scheme—If you'll promise me, Sir, not to—</P>

man, you make nothing of displaying an ell of sword∣blade in defence of your mistress's top-knot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you know I love too tenderly to bear the test of raillery—it is the infirmity of my temper; why would you put me to it?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brumpton.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you that know my turn of mind, why would you be angry with me?—I am happily a follower of the laughing philosopher—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>Po! prithee, man, don't be such a cox∣comb.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brumpton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee, don't you be so morose, so sour, so discontented a spirit—But if in your phrase I am a coxcomb, with all my heart, i'faith: but take this along with you—what you mean as a term of reproach, I receive as a compliment to the materials nature has been pleased to compound in this happy frame of mine—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>Po! Po! running on at the old rate—If self-applause be philosophy, you have a comfortable share.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brumpton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have, Sir, and while my happiness is preserved by it, keep you the gravity and good sense, that make you too refined to be pleased, too wise to be merry, and too knowing to be contented.—I am in a fair way to be successful, without any trouble at all;—you are likely to be most scurvily disappointed after a world of pains—An humble bow, which my dancing-master taught me, while I laughed at him, a fashionable coat, for which, if my taylor is ever paid he will laugh at me,—an intriguing snuff-box,— and an apt valet de chambre, all these make love for me, and—.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you assume the merit of the con∣quest—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brumpton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! yes, when the trouble is over, I take the reward.—Did you ever know a general officer, who, when the horse and the foot, and the right and left wing have carried the day for him, did not claim to himself both the honour and the booty?
<PB N="6" REF="15"/>
But you make a toil of a pleasure—love, which to me is a scene of delight, to you is a drudgery; your temper grows as sour, as a prude's when the sermon is long; and as hot as a Welshman's, if you laugh at his pedigree; or a professed sharper's, if you doubt his honour, after he has cogged the dice, and picked your pocket of your money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I own I am piqued and naturally. If any friend of mine, out of mere spleen, speak de∣tractingly of the person I admire: it were base infi∣delity in love not to defend her, when she is dispa∣raged—my every thought is dedicated to her.—Absent I see her, hear her, and my imagination gloats for ever on her charms.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brumpton.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you are so easily alarmed, that little difficulties are the Alps and Pireneans in your way—Now my faith in these matters removes mountains—But indeed in all things we are opposite characters—If a tradesman brings you in a bill and presses for payment, <Q>'Sdeath! does the scoundrel doubt my honour? does he mean to affront me?</Q>—Now I, when my father suffered me to be arrested, went cheerfully into con∣finement, and diverted myself for three weeks together with the bum-bailiff's character—In the business of our softer passions, the same humour pursues us—you write studied letters to your Dulcinea, I am written to;—you sigh, I sing;—you fret I am gay;—you, upon a disappointment, <Q>Furies, death, and rage—there is no enduring this—life is grown a burden—damnation!</Q> I burst into a laugh, and what a whimsical world we live in—ha! ha!—But come, I will hear your melancholy story,—Well, the old dragon I suppose watches the Hesperian fruit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>He does, Sir—he keeps her locked up as a miler does his gold, not to be made use of till his death, and then to fall into hands that won't know the value of it—Its love's last shift with me; she is inaccessible, and her guardian, old Lovibond, pro∣poses to marry her himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="16"/>
<SPEAKER>Brumpton.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so, like the tyrant of old, intends to tack a living and dead body together.</P>

<P>You are too hard upon 'em—they are seldom guilty of that mischief;—I have known 'em have twins at a birth; that is, when some such cox∣comb as myself gives them a helping hand;—and then the old fellow cocks his hat upon it, and totters about so vigorously, wondering how the babes resem∣ble him in every particular; whilst the mother knows, that she followed the example of the Grecian painter, and took a feature from every one of her acquaint∣ance.—If he prevents your marrying her, take your revenge that way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prophanation!—her virtue, Sir—besides the world could never repair the loss—her heart I am sure is mine—I used to visit there—but now no admittance; an evidence on the crown side in a mes∣senger's hands is not better secured.</P>

<P>Now my business goes on without any trouble or difficulty. My old dragon is in the coun∣try, and has left his fair ward, the sweetest girl, my dear Belford.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>You described her yesterday but few re∣moves from a downright idiot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brumpton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon me—she is simple indeed—But such a simplicity!—It just serves to shew that in∣justice has been done her in her education, but in her every turn she gives such tokens of sensibility!—She has beauty without knowing it;—certain wild graces, rather than accomplishments, and talents instead of sense.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>Po! Po!—a mere rustic beauty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brumpton.</SPEAKER>
<P>There now, derogating from her merit, and yet I am calm!—the truth is she has been brought up in the country, and wickedly kept in ignorance,
<PB N="8" REF="17"/>
that she might fall an easy prey to her guardian—But I have raised a spirit in her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how the devil did you gain access to her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brumpton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was going to tell you—Old Nestor's out of town, and has left her in the care of the two veriest simpletons that ever whistled for want of thought at a country fair—But gold, Sir, gold, that speaks all languages, and adapts itself to all capacities, has pleaded most eloquently for me—But, come, I positively must leave you.</P>

<P>Nay, if it must be so—</P>

<P>That's quite another business; what I do, is no rule for your actions—</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovibond.</SPEAKER>
<P>Full ten years before me in the race of life—besides, you are an old batchelor;—a stranger to the ways of wedlock—I am enured to the service—your sister, Mr. Oldcastle, could have told you what a desperate good husband I was—But, lack a day!— you begin late—mercy on your forehead, say I, mercy on your forehead!—</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oldcastle.</SPEAKER>
<P>And a pleasant topic it is!—Why matri∣mony affords a little comedy in every family one knows—But the education I have given Mary Ann—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovibond.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is the worst in the world—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oldcastle.</SPEAKER>
<P>The very best!—I have trained her up in plain simplicity—woman's wit teems with contriv∣ances to disgrace her husband—yet you would educate Harriet in this profligate town!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovibond.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, and I have taught her to know right from wrong.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oldcastle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right from wrong! you have ruined the girl—have not you indulged her in every whimsy this fertile town affords?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovibond.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have shewn her the world—</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovibond.</SPEAKER>
<P>Common-place invective!—Harriet will know how to avoid—</P>
</SP>
<SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovibond.</SPEAKER>
<P>She will have too much honour —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oldcastle.</SPEAKER>
<P>She will have too much wit—now Mary Ann has no wild notions, and of course no dangerous curiosity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovibond.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her curiosity is to come—she'll fall a prey to the first powdered coxcomb that bows to her—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oldcastle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her simplicity will preserve her—</P>

<P>But when the serpents of this town be∣gin to whisper in her ear—</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Oldcastle.</SPEAKER>
<P>They'll have no opportunity—She is snug in a little box of an house, which I have taken in the name of Mr. Biddulph. I have another lodging in my own name, where I do business.—Nobody will see her; and when the nine day's wonder is over,
<PB N="11" REF="20"/>
I shall pack off to the country, and so escape from impertinence.</P>

<P>Ay! now I am unfortunate—Oh! the human mind!—Yes, Sir, I am disappointed—Ha! ha!—Brisk is in a devil of a pickle! He went in dis∣guise to carry off my little goddess for me—Some∣body that resembles him has committed a robbery in Northamptonshire—They have charged Brisk, and he writes me here, that they have carried him before Mr. Carbuncle, the wine-merchant, who deals out bad law, and adulterate port, to all St. Anne's parish—Brisk will be chronicled in miserable elegy, clubbed by two poets upon a flock-bed in the Old Jewry;—the historians of Grub-street are already preparing "The Life and Conversation of Jeremy Brisk, who was born of honest parents"—Ha! ha! poor devil!

<P>Yes, the wicked contriver! a letter in it—I ran to the window to throw it to him again, but he was gone, and then it occurred to me that it might not be quite so prudent to throw it into the street, lest it should fall into the hands of malicious people, who might misinterpret appearances to my disadvantage.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bellford.</SPEAKER>
<P>But after surmounting every difficulty, now in this last stage of the business to let your spirits sink, would be such a falling off from the character you have supported this day;—a character that sur∣passes all the heroines in romance, both for spirit and contrivance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>The difficulties I had to encounter rouzed my spirits for a while, just as fits give us for the time, more than our natural strength;—but now the conflict's over, my resolution staggers, and I am at full leisure to feel the weakness of my condition—I can't go through it, Mr. Bellford, I can't indeed—</P>
