<SPEAKER>Young <HI>Woodville.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>HA! <HI>Delamour!</HI> welcome from <HI>Paris,</HI> my dear friend <STAGE>(embrace;)</STAGE> and honest <HI>Thady,</HI> how dost do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Je vous remercies; I am bravely, sir, thank your axing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Del.</SPEAKER>
<P>The sight of my dear <HI>Woodville,</HI> in good health, gives me infinite pleasure. I am well,
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
you see; but my heart, ah, <HI>Woodville,</HI> not all the sparkling beauties of the <HI>Louvre</HI> have had power to efface my charming <HI>Emily's</HI> dear, dear idea. But how does the lovely girl?—say, is she in town, that I may fly—ha! what?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. <HI>Wood.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I am extremely sorry that I am oblig'd, like your evil genius, to meet you with ill news on your arrival; but all the consolation I can afford my dear friend, is an assurance of my sister's constancy—To keep you no longer in suspense—my father has promis'd her hand to Sir <HI>Geofry Ginkle</HI>—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Del.</SPEAKER>
<P>Cursed, infernal avarice! What motive else could have induced, the hitherto kindest parent, to make a sacrifice of his darling, his blooming <HI>Emily,</HI> to such an old—By Heaven I'll go this instant, and—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Arrah sir, sir, your putting yourself into passions, and flurries, is mighty silly—might silly; upon my soul—Couggar—I'll be bound to put you in a way, that you may have your own game with him. I'll tell you, d'ye see, I'll watch this Mr. <HI>Gingle,</HI> if it's <HI>Gingle</HI> you call him, and Manumshandoul, if I don't put the speak out of him,—and then, when the old divil is quiet in his grave, you may cuckold him as fast as you please. Eh, sir, <STAGE><HI>(turning to</HI> Woodville,)</STAGE> wou'dn't there be some fun in that? <STAGE><HI>(All this while</HI> Delamour <HI>walks about in great disorder.)</HI></STAGE></P>

<SPEAKER>Y. <HI>Wood.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What, <HI>Thady,</HI> sure you would not commit murder.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Murther, arrah fat, murther, an ould son of a whore that has one leg already in the grave, and if I trip the other after it, is that murther? Oh the devil a murther in that, sure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. <HI>Wood.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, <HI>Delamour,</HI> don't be so uneasy, your case is not desperate, the in∣dissoluble knot is yet to be tied.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Del.</SPEAKER>
<P>Happy <HI>Woodville,</HI> happy in being con∣scious you possess my sister's heart unrivall'd, free from the harsh injunctions of an obdurate parent to thwart your loves—but I—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. <HI>Wood.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, <HI>Delamour,</HI> I am no object to be envied, and far from having an assurance of <HI>Florimel's</HI> affections; happy, then, indeed should I be; but she is still the same gay, unthink∣ing, lovely, witty rogue; if in the most un∣feign'd rapture I breathe my love, the return is a loud laugh, an opera tune, or a ridiculous simile, which, faith, sometimes makes me look very silly; indeed, in her more serious moments, which are but few, she, perhaps, gives me an hearing, when all at once a crowd of gayer thoughts rush on, and kill at once the hopes wherewith I was elated a few minutes before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Del.</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall find me a powerful advocate in your cause, but excuse me for deviating from the maxims of our modern professors of the law; my proceedings in your favour, will not be
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
wholly disinterested; you must give me all the assistance in your power, to break the measures of your father and Sir <HI>Geofry;</HI> but how such a notion enter'd into his doating brain, is to me amazing. I've often heard him express the ut∣most abhorrence to matrimony; but then, when I reflect upon my <HI>Emily</HI>'s beauty, I can't wonder at his being caught; old goat—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. <HI>Wood.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Love is far from being the sole motive of Sir <HI>Geofry</HI>'s addresses to <HI>Emily;</HI> the vain hopes of having an heir of his own beget∣ting, to inherit his estate, (which, you know, is considerable,) and to mortify his nephew; these are the spurs which prick him on, in the road which has hitherto appear'd so dreadful to him. I dare say, you know this nephew; as Sir <HI>Geofry</HI> had no children of his own, and intended never to marry, he bred him up under his own care, placed his chief felicity in having him receive those ac∣complishments, proper for a person, who (as he was to inherit Sir <HI>Geofry</HI>'s estate after his decease) probably might make a figure in the great world; these accomplishments, join'd to a natural fine genius, a graceful person, and a beneficent cour∣teous disposition, gain'd him the esteem of all who knew him—He was the darling of his uncle. But in this happy state, he, following the dic∣tates of love before those of his interest, un∣known to his uncle, espous'd a young lady whose only want was a fortune sufficient to ren∣der
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
her a match suitable for the heir of Sir <HI>Geofry.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word I commend his notion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. <HI>Wood.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>This imprudence of the young gentleman so exasperated the old knight, that, when he heard of it, he swore he should never be a shilling the better for him; refus'd to see him; and now this unfortunate couple are oblig'd to subsist upon a small patrimony, left him by his father, in a remote part of <HI>Cornwall.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Del.</SPEAKER>
<P>By your account, I really pity them, and wish with my soul, for their sake as well as my own, the current of his affections cou'd be turn'd to its former channel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. <HI>Wood.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh 'tis the most inflexible, positive Curmudgeon; you might as soon persuade a <HI>Jewish Rabbi</HI> to turn <HI>Jesuit.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tha.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Rabbit turn Jeshit—upon my soul a comical change. Howsomever, they've very pretty boroughs; where we were they call 'em Colleges.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. <HI>Wood.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>He's so fix'd on the completion of this marriage, that, to make sure of my father's consent, he has offer'd to take <HI>Emily</HI> without a portion; there he touch'd the vein; my father, at first, shock'd at such an odd proposition, gave his old friend very little encouragement; but the mention of no fortune, together with Sir <HI>Geofry</HI>'s great estate, stifled all parental tender∣ness, and he now exerts all his authority, to
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
oblige poor <HI>Emily</HI> to name the day, and, till then, to look upon Sir <HI>Geofry</HI> as a gentleman, whom his prudence has destin'd her for a hus∣band. You may judge the distress these com∣mands gave her, and the conflict she suffers, be∣tween her aversion to Sir <HI>Geofry,</HI> and the conse∣quence of her acquiescence to her father's will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Del.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor dear girl! But cou'd I not get a sight of her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wood.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, by no means, if my father knew of your arrival, 'twould bar all access to your future happiness, as he'd oblige her to marry Sir <HI>Geofry</HI> immediately; as yet, I'll not inform <HI>Emily</HI> you're in town; I'll meet you this evening at <HI>Fynmore</HI>'s in <HI>Pall-mall,</HI> where, I hope, we'll think of some expedients, for our mutual ad∣vantages; adieu, dear <HI>Delamour.</HI></P>

<P>Oh, never fear, sur; I'll be bound she shan't know I'm in <HI>London;</HI> no, no; but, sur, if you'd give your kind love, and surreverance to her for me, I'd—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>How cruel is it for fathers to assume so unjust a prerogative, as to oblige children to marry who they please.—Because they are the means of bringing us into the world, they think to be ever after the sole disposers, and masters of our inclinations, and will make us happy, or miserable, according to their capri∣cious tempers. Ah, unkind <HI>Delamour!</HI> after repeated vows of inviolable constancy, to leave me to the perils I now suffer—on the eve of being torn from you for ever.—But here comes my father and my wrinkled Strephon—Heigh ho—</P>

<P>I tell you I'll consider nothing, only—Sir <HI>Geofry,</HI> I beg your pardon; I was talking with my daughter, about some affairs relative to the marriage.—I must step to the <HI>Bedford</HI> Coffee-house for half an hour, or so—to meet a gentleman—Sir <HI>Geofry,</HI> as you'll eat a bit of

<SPEAKER>Emil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wou'd, sir, that sun had sufficient power to melt you into pity. (I must summon all my little rhetoric, to turn this persecution from me, <STAGE>aside.</STAGE>) Think, sir, the violence you are doing me, in separating me for ever from the man I love; affinity in years, sentiment, circumstan∣ces, with him, all, all conspire to render me un∣happy, in marrying you; if so, you shall have my hand alone; as my heart is the property of another, you can't expect it.—</P>

<P>Zounds! at that rate she'd think nothing of giving the possession of her whole body to him that has her heart, if she'd a good opportunity; one comfort, he's in <HI>Paris;</HI> wou'd to heaven some testy Monsieur wou'd run him through the body.</P>

<P><STAGE>Aside.</STAGE> The monster mocks me; well, I'll serve him in his turn.—Oh, sir, white and silver, by all means, (I'll pluck up my spirit;) how unfortunate am I, to be prepossiess'd in favour of another; numbers of ladies of beauty and rank would be rejoiced, and with extasy accept of the honor of being lady <HI>Ginkle;</HI> set∣ting your fine person, your graceful figure, your polite address, your—</P>

<P>Now, if our petticoat triumvirate does not counterplot, and defeat, the prudent schemes of our brace of wise grey beards, may my doom be to die an old maid; but to business.—I'll immediately write an anonymous letter to Sir <HI>Geofry,</HI> as it were from an unknown friend—I'll let him know, that the person he designs for his wife, is unworthy of that honor, by having, criminal connection with a certain gentleman;—To corroborate this, I'll appoint a time, when he may have ocular demonstration of her dis∣honour; he'll immediately fall into his old opi∣nions, and, receiving this as orthodox, fly to the place of appointment. Now I've two or three suits of <HI>Delamour</HI>'s cloaths—one suit remarkably rich—these will I put on, and at the time ap∣pointed, which may be some very unseasonable hour, will come, and be let in by <HI>Betty</HI>—Then you shall see me, <HI>en cavalier;</HI> and you must own a figure less agreeable wou'd create a jealousy, in one more proof against deception, than your old lover.</P>

<SPEAKER>Emi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, my dear <HI>Florimel,</HI> the first thing he'll do, is certainly to tell my father, and I

dread the effects of his rage.—In his first trans∣ports of fury, he'll turn me out of doors, then my imaginary shame will be publick. No, I could not bear to be esteemed what I most abhor.—Ah, <HI>Florimel,</HI> you have my sincere thanks, but I must not, cannot think of putting your scheme into execution.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, I must use you as a kind nurse would a froward child, force you to what's for your good.—You must, can, and shall carry this inimitable scheme into execution.—Faith, like a poor poet, I must praise the productions of my own brain, since I can get no other to do it.—Eh, Mrs. <HI>Betty</HI> what do you think?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, ma'am, I think your scheme is <HI>unlimitable,</HI> as your ladyship says; and I thinks as how, if my lady knows what's what, she'd stop at nothing to give sir <HI>Geofry a gust</HI> to her—</P>

<P>From my soul.—I knew the effect the knowledge of this unfortunate affair would have on you, therefore I intended you should never know a syllable of it from me.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Ant.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Here, <STAGE>[Going to the wing,]</STAGE> here, who's there? I'll turn the ungracious wretch out of my doors this instant, to meet the infamy she deserves—what, to make my house a bro∣thel—As for her seducer, I'll—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Geo.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, hear reason, get the better of your choler; your exposing her in that man∣ner would be wrong, quite wrong. Give me leave to advise you—Keep the whole a secret,
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>
even from your servants; as for <HI>Betty,</HI> she has been her confidant; send immediately to <HI>Dela∣mour,</HI> found him about a marriage with <HI>Emily</HI>—I know his circumstances perfectly, as some of his land borders upon mine. He has a very pretty estate, but a little encumbered, owing to some extravagancies incident to young men of his volatile disposition. The fortune which I refused with <HI>Emily,</HI> will help to clear his estate, and pay off his sister <HI>Florimel</HI>'s fortune; these considerations, joined to an innate principle of honour, which I never knew him deviate from till now, perhaps may influence him to accept of your offer; but don't you mention the least knowledge of their intercourse—What think ye?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Ant.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I don't know, my dear friend, you're too good, too good, indeed; and so should I be to follow your advice—But though she has gone astray, yet she is still my child.—Were I sure he'd cover her shame by marriage, with pleasure I'd double her portion—But 'tis most amazing—I did not think <HI>Delamour</HI> was return'd from <HI>France</HI>—Oh, sure, if I knew he was in the same kingdom, I should have taken better care of her; but, however, I'll send for him immedi∣ately—But 'tis to no purpose—a likely thing, a young fellow, like him, would tye himself for life to one he has gained upon such easy terms; and as for trusting to his honour, the young
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>
fellows of this age use the bare word as an in∣strument of deception on the weaker sex; the practice to them is a mere jest: Indeed her fortune, I don't know what that may do; I won't see her till I try my success with him, which is so much the better for her, for I don't think but I should dash her brains out, were I to see her. I'll instantly send to him.</P>
<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE>

<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Geo.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Do. Well, my friend Sir <HI>Anthony,</HI> I can't say but you're rightly serv'd, for preferring the love of your pelf, to the future peace and happiness of your child. Zounds! what an old, blind fool I must be, to think of marrying a girl of eighteen, as if I did not know the sex perfectly—I, that am now—let me see, how old am I now?—eh—adod, I'm upwards of three∣score; aye, I shall be sixty-two the eighteenth of next—aye, <HI>September</HI>—I'm greatly afraid that young dog <HI>Delamour</HI> will not marry the girl—I wish he wou'd—I pity her, from my soul—Well, well, I'll send to <HI>Cornwall</HI> for my poor nephew and my pretty niece, and reinstate him in my favour—Poor <HI>Ned</HI> was always a good lad, and how can I blame him for doing a thing I was upon the point of doing myself; more ex∣cusable in him, because of his youth—Farewel matrimony—Well, if ever I marry, may this foolish sconce of mine be adorn'd with a pair of horns, each as long as a barber's pole.</P>

<P>Very well, sir; the fortune I in∣tended to have given with <HI>Emily,</HI> if married with my consent, was six thousand pounds; now, sir, as I am conscious of your extraordi∣nary merit, whereby I think you are not indif∣ferent to her, if you love her well enough to marry her, I'll double that sum; what say you, sir?</P>
