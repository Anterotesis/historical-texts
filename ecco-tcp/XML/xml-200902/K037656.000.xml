<HEAD>DEDICATION. TO MRS. MONTAGUE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH I can boast no acquaintance with Mrs. MONTAGUE, but that intellectual one, which the world of taste in general claims with her; I trust she will pardon the liberty of prefixing her name to a comedy, the writer of which feels an admiration equal to her own for Shakespeare. When research and criticism seemed exhausted in throwing lights on the works of this great fountain of English dramatic genius, you, Madam, as if a spirit more congenial to his own, ap∣proach still nearer to the Immortal Poet, dispel the last mist which time had shed
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
around him, and unveil the full glory of his mind. The small tribute of respect I have presumed to pay your talents in the course of my comedy, Madam, was, believe me, the spontaneous incense of my heart; and I have the satisfaction to reflect, that no reader will suspect me of flattery in this declaration, but one who is a stranger to your same, and to your virtues.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I have the honour to be, MADAM, Your devoted, and obedient servant, FREDERICK PILON.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE very great success which has at∣tended the performance of the following Comedy, induces the author to state a cir∣cumstance which, on the first blush of the business, must appear rather singular. <HI>He would be a Soldier</HI> was presented to Mr. Col∣man in the course of last Summer, and re∣turned—because <HI>that gentleman did not like a line of it;</HI> and left this comfortable intelli∣gence were not sufficient to wound the feel∣ings of the writer, Mr. Colman added, he did not know <HI>what could be done with it, or in what shape it could be produced, so as to contri∣bute to the entertainment of the public.</HI></P>
<P>The Author declares, that he then enter∣tained such notions of Mr. Colman's <HI>judge∣ment, taste,</HI> and high <HI>sense of honour,</HI> that his opinion was final with him; he laid by his performance in despair of ever acquiring pro∣fit or same by it:—fortunately an intimate friend one day advised him to show the piece to Mr. Harris; imagining even <HI>Mr. Colman might be mistaken,</HI> or influenced by <HI>motives, the</HI>
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
<HI>writer of this address</HI> never-suspected any man harboured, till bitter experience convinced him of the contrary. Mr. Harris, to the very great surprise, and, no doubt, very <HI>great pleasure</HI> of the author, happened to be totally of a different way of thinking from Mr. Col∣man; and what is more, he heard the latter gentleman's opinion of the Comedy, but <HI>had too strong, and too good a mind to be biassed by it.</HI> The success which has attended the piece makes all farther comment on this short history of it unnecessary; and with the live∣liest sense of gratitude for the marked atten∣tion, kindness, and liberality of Mr. Harris, the author submits his production to the pe∣rusal of the world.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>WRITTEN BY THE AUTHOR OF THE COMEDY, AND SPOKEN BY MR. FARREN.</BYLINE>
<SP>
<LG>
<L>PROLOGUES were first plain, simple bills of fare;</L>
<L>You just were told your entertainment there.</L>
<L>Without, parade, or aim at brilliant hit,</L>
<L>Genius was thrifty then, as rich in wit.</L>
<L>Our modern bards a diff'rent plan pursue,</L>
<L>And a fair outside always hold to view;</L>
<L>With point and jest the prologue still must play.</L>
<L>And strike each insect folly of the day.</L>
<L>But folly now unstricken, wild may fly,</L>
<L>For the muse wasts a fav'rite to the sky:</L>
<L>Can little objects charm or fill the mind,</L>
<L>When Howard's claims are known to all mankind?</L>
<L>Distance and clime in him excite no fears;</L>
<L>He visits dungeons, and the sick bed chears;</L>
<L>Fearless of danger, nobly on he goes,</L>
<L>Round the whole globe, to heal the wretches' woes:</L>
<L>Brother to all who like himself had birth,</L>
<L>He walks his Maker's messenger on earth;</L>
<L>And in the monument his country rears,</L>
<L>That country a divided glory shares.</L>
<L>To a great people, thus to merit true,</L>
<L>Why for our bard shou'd we protection sue?</L>
<L>Worth still you foster; and where faults are found,</L>
<L>You probe to heal, and not enlarge the wound.</L>
<L>The reason strong that guides your ev'ry aim,</L>
<L>Cancels or seals disinterested fame.</L>
<L>If English genius, soaring eagle high</L>
<L>All nations, drops still in a lower sky,</L>
<L>It is because the sons of fame well know,</L>
<L>The praise that's worth ambition, you bestow.</L>

<P>To how many! Were a dozen such fine women as yourself to appear every day in public, there would be no such thing as walking the streets for you; a man should have a piece of flint in his breast.</P>

<P>How can I help it? I follow a fine wo∣man by instinct.—Do, my dear, kind, cruel angel, tell me where you live. <STAGE>(Takes hold of her hand.)</STAGE></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But to what purpose? I can never see you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Why not, my love?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, I am an old married woman! <STAGE>(Faintly struggling to disengage her hand.)</STAGE> You wicked devil, leave me. The neighbours will take notice, and I shall get a bad name by you.— Do go—I'm just at home.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Johns.</SPEAKER>
<P>But which is the house you live at?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't tell you—besides, I think I see my husband talking to the orange woman at the door; in the straw hat and scarlet cloak, with a little curly-pole boy in her hand, eating ginger-bread.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Johns.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, that's the George inn. 'Sdeath! do you live there?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, you devil! I shall be ruin'd if ever you come after me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Johns.</SPEAKER>
<P>Zounds! it's the very house I was going to.—Isn't it kept by one Jacob Wilkins?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, it is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Johns.</SPEAKER>
<P>We're quite at home now.—I suppose you're old Jacob's daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I happen to be old Jacob's wife, tho'.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Johns.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, my dear, how long are you mar∣ried?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>A long time, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Johns.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not a long time, I am sure, from your looks.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Looks are very deceitful, especially those of married folks. I was married Candle∣mas day, five—long—months.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Johns.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor creature! you have had a tedious time of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what's your business with Jacob Wilkins? Can't I do it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Johns.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you do Jacob's business some∣times?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure I do, when he's out of the way. Poor man! it's a great relief to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Johns.</SPEAKER>
<P>But this is a matter on which I must see himself.—Col. Talbot, a gentleman of whom I think you must have heard, if you be Wilkins' wife, has wrote to him, and desired I would see him in consequence of that letter: were you at home when he received it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I was not, Sir: but I have often heard of Col. Talbot; he's an Oxfordshire gen∣tleman; his family, I hear, was the makings of Wilkins. Lord! he has been a long time in the Indies, and, I'm told, has made a power of mo∣ney. But is he come home, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Johns.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is; and since, his return has been down in Oxfordshire, in search of Wilkins, where he thought he still lived; and would have come here himself now, only he's very much indis∣posed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bless your heart! Jacob Wilkins has been in town, and kept the George inn these ten years.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Johns.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has made a very ungrateful return to his benefactor, Col. Talbot. My master thought him dead, not having heard from him so many years: a conduct that was unpardonable, consi∣dering his obligations to the Colonel, and the great trust reposed in him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Great trust! Lord, Sir! what was it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Johns.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Colonel Talbot left a son in his care—but come along, and I'll tell you the whole story by the way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>We must not be seen together for the world; my husband is as jealous as the vengeance.
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>
Take a turn down this next street, and let me go home alone. Follow me in about ten minutes; but take care you don't speak to me as if you had seen me before.</P>

<P>My dear Mrs. Wilkins, what do you take me for? Do you suppose I never paid a visit to a married woman in my life?</P>

<P>I am ruin'd.</P>

<P>I say, woman, I'm undone; and the sooner I'm out of England, the better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, lord! you terrify me out of my wits, Jacob!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Suppose the best friend you had in the world had entrusted an only child to your care, and that thro' neglect you had lost him, what wou'd you have to say for yourself?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is that your case, my dear?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But tell me how it happen'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have frequently heard me make men∣tion of Colonel Talbot, in whose family I was brought up?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure I have.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a son of his I have lost.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>You astonish me! But how came so great a man's son to be left in your care?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you must know that Colonel Tal∣bot, previous to his going abroad, was privately married to a beautiful girl who waited on his mo∣ther: he had a son by this girl; and as the child came into the world just as he was obliged to em∣bark with the army for Portugal, the war before last, he left him in my care, desiring me to let him pass for my own till his return; and in case he was kill'd, to continue the deception till the death of his father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And has the Colonel never been in England since?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never till within these few days; there∣fore his son continued with me till he was twelve years old, when I lost him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>In what manner did you lose him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot be certain: but, as he was a boy of great spirit, and ever prattling of being a sol∣dier, I suspect he was inveigled off by a recruiting
<PB N="6" REF="13"/>
party, which at that time was beating up for men in the village.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Didn't you acquaint his mother im∣mediately with what had happen'd?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>She was dead.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>You wrote to the Colonel, to be sure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>There I was to blame. I cou'dn't sum∣mon up resolution sufficient. I thought he wou'd have attributed the child's leaving me, to neglect, or cruel treatment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>The best advice I can give you is, to tell Colonel Talbot his son is dead.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how shall I produce a certificate of that? Should he examine the parish register, and no record of such a child's death be found, I shou'd be taken up, and tried on a suspicion of murder.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then tell him the truth at once.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Worse and worse!—He'll suppose this a mere invention of my own, to screen my villany; else, why was I silent so long? and that I had been brib'd by his relations to remove an obstacle to their inheriting both his acquir'd and paternal fortune.</P>

<P>THIS is a devilish lucky hit, the Colonel's hav∣ing a son; it enables me to provide for both my niece and daughter—I expect from the latter a good deal of contradiction in this business, but I like that; I shou'dn't love her half so much as I do, if she hadn't spirit enough to contradict me—it shews she has an opinion of her own, and gives me an opportunity to prove that I have one also; but of a much superior kind, and upon occasions of a very coercive quality; it's one time in a hundred I can get any body to contradict me; but men of large independent fortunes never hear the truth—no∣body has spirit enough to oppose them in discourse—Henceforward, I am determined to take no man by the hand, who does not speak and look, when we come to debate, as if he wou'd knock me down in an argument. Well, I think I shall be as happy as a married man can be, when my girls are disposed of; my wife, to be sure, has a most un∣accountable humour; to suppose I'm jealous of her, now she's in her fifty-fifth year—to do Lady Lucretia Oldstock justice, she was once a charm∣ing woman; but at present, I think her as plain a <HI>piece of goods,</HI> as a man could meet between Temple-Bar and Whitechapel,—here she comes, brimfull of news.</P>

<P>So I do: I always think that person has a design upon another, to whom he gives their

<P>You are now more provoking, if pos∣sible, than ever; when you find I hold your ridi∣culous suspicions in contempt, you wou'd wound me another way, and mortify my pride, by insinu∣ating, that I never had attractions sufficient to have a civil thing said to me, like other women.</P>

<P>There there it broke forth! What it is to be married to a jealous husband!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir O.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, all this I can bear, because I like contradiction—I consider the mind like a spring; the more you press it, the more vigour you lend to its elasticity; since I can remember, I always de∣lighted to be of a different opinion from other people; there's something wonderfully flattering to human pride in being singular—but in marriage it is absolutely neccessary—man and wife are like the contending qualities of bitter and sweet; they na∣turally quarrel, and exist by downright oppo∣sition.</P>

<P>You shan't budge a step after her—Soothing her in these humours is only adding fuel to fire. Your mother, Charlotte, was born a co∣quette, and will die one. She was a reigning toast in her youth, and to this hour expects the adulation of those days. She had a whole army of lovers; and, what you'll say ought to make me set a very high value upon her indeed, either from necessity, or choice, she hung like an overblown rose on the virgin thorn, full four and thirty years wait∣ing for me. But come, sit down, and let me talk to you. <STAGE>(They sit.)</STAGE> I have for some time back observed, Charlotte, that the match I pro∣posed to you with Mandeville, does not meet your wishes.</P>

<P>No, my girl, you shall never be sacrificed at the altar of Plutus—I say sacrificed—for, what is it, in fact, but a sacrifice, to throw away a fine young woman upon a man it is impossible she should like; as many fathers do every day, who love money more than their children.</P>

<P>How liable we are to be mistaken in our surmises of other people's thoughts! No, no, my girl, I have no such match to propose to you—I have a husband for you, it is true, in my eye; and a rich one too—but it is not to riches you object—it is to the man; and provided he be agreeable, I imagine, no woman in her senses can suppose a husband may be too rich?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="20" REF="27"/>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>Provided riches be obtained without leaving a stain upon the principles, it is happiness to possess them, as they give us so much more ample power of distributing felicity. I never was that ro∣mantic fool to imagine there can be happiness where there is not independency; grant me that, and all the wealth beside, which the earth contains, or the sea-devours, shou'd not bribe me to sell the free elec∣tion of my heart, or barter for gold, what gold could never restore me.</P>

<P>Give me a kiss, you jade! You are your father's own daughter; but every body tells me you're the picture of me; and, if the Colonel's son be but as like his father as you are yours, you'll be the handsomest couple in Great Britain.</P>

<P>I shou'd not have believ'd it possible your Honor cou'd have had such a son, let his educa∣tion be what it may.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own, Johnson, the weakness of a father induc'd me to believe I shou'd have found him very different; I fancied I shou'd have seen him emerging from the low contracted sphere to which his fate had consign'd him, by the native energy of his own powers; and flatter'd myself with the pleasing dream of surprising a young man with affluence and distinction, who in obscurity had acquir'd virtue to deserve them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Johns.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg your Honor's pardon:—but as I cannot see the least likeness of you in this young gentleman's face, I suppose he resembled his mo∣ther.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>His mother!—She had the countenance of an angel!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Johns.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then he differs from you both most de∣vilishly!— But, Sir, the sooner you provide him with a fencing and a dancing master the better; the latter of these gentlemen seems indispensably
<PB N="23" REF="30"/>
necessary, if it's only to teach him to walk; for no raw recruit on the first day of drilling was ever more pigeon-toed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Where is he now?</P>
</SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Johns.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir: a small morsel he takes before dinner, just to stay his stomach, consisting of about a pound of beaf steaks and a tankard of porter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Send him to me. <STAGE>(<HI>Exit</HI> Johnson.)</STAGE>—I fear he's incorrigibly gone, beyond the power of re∣formation.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Mandeville.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Mandeville, what course do you ad∣vise me to pursue with this untoward boy? With all his faults, I must consider he is my son, and pity, whilst he compels me to blush for him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, we must endeavour to form him as well as we can: but I am rather inclined to think we shall never be able to give him the graces.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>He's not three and twenty—that's young; we have many begin later in life to acquire the rudiments of those sciences, in which they after∣wards arriv'd to the highest pitch of eminence.— Have you been able to discover how the natural bent of his temper inclines, or if he has any strong propensities?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, from what I can collect in my short acquaintance with him, the natural bent of his temper seems inclin'd to gallantry; and if he has any strong propensity, it is to the game of skittles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>No matter how low and vulgar the game be, it shews a spirit of play in him, and it must be crush'd: but if he has a turn for gallantry,
<PB N="24" REF="31"/>
it gives me the greatest hopes of his reformation. The society of an accomplish'd and beautiful wo∣man softens and refines the roughest nature; she imparts, by a secret magic, her elegances and her graces; and to converse with her, is a kind of study that insensibly polishes her admirer.—But what reason have you to suppose he is inclin'd to gallantry?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has imparted all his amours to me; but one in particular, which very much diverted me, indeed:—After having been successful with bar maids, young milleners, and taylors' daugh∣ters, out of number, Cupid shot him from a cheese-cake battery, and he fell in love with a pastrycook's daughter; which, oh, terrible! was the cause of his having an affair of honor with an attorney's clerk, in which both parties were bound over: but in painting this Helen, who bred the contention, how shall I do him justice at second hand? Teniers lent him his pencil for her waist, and Titian for her head; for she was shap'd like a Dutch cheese, and her locks were as red as a carrot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have sent for him; and as I shall examine him closely, in order to search if there be any la∣tent seeds of ability, which culture may bring forth, I wish you, Mandeville, to be present, and that you will also assist me in the inquiry.</P>
</SP>

<P>Bless your heart, you can't offend me! I'm one of the best-temper'd boys breathing:— but what's the matter with old Firelock? He seems in the sulks.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ca.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! I understand you; I shou'd always make a bow when I come into a place where he is—Ecod, with all my heart: but what set me wrong, was hearing it said, that to have no man∣ners at all was the best of breeding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ceremony is altogether as ridiculous, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>udeness is offensive; you must avoid both.</P>

<P>Have you ever read any thing in your life?</P>

<P>Why, do you think I can't read? Then I tell you I can; and write and cypher too.</P>

<SPEAKER>Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>He doesn't doubt that; he only wishes to know what kind of reading or books you are fond of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ca.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you may tell him, I am fond of histories.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's a good hearing, faith! If he's fond of history, he must possess from nature a strong inquisitive mind under all this unpromising d'a∣bord. Men, educated in a low sphere of life, however uncouthly they express themselves, often manifest a strong intellect; and on being put to the test, discover a fund of knowledge the better-educated man wou'd not expect from a slight ac∣quaintance with them: I consider such minds like rich metals, as yet unpurify'd from alloy; but let it once be known that the ore is gold, and the refiner's hand will soon bring forth the bul∣lion.—As you are fond of history, you have no doubt dipt into the histories of Greece and Rome.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>The best of their histories.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whose were they?</P>

<P>Ask him no more questions.</P>

<P>I have procur'd you a commission; no son of mine shall waste his youth in ease and indo∣lence, dissipating that wealth I so hardly earn'd: the greater part, it is true, he shall enjoy; but he shall first prove by his courage, and his services to his country, that he deserves it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why cannot man make over his mind, like his property to his children? Any distinguishing quality in all other animals survives in the same species by hereditary descent for ever; man con∣tinues upon the earth only in his name and his revenues.—Oh, that he should leave behind him his least valuable part, and all that made him good or great should sink into the dust with him!</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good news, indeed, Johnson; and heavy and afflicted as my heart is, your tidings cheer it.
<PB N="29" REF="36"/>
The Count, Mandeville, is an officer of infinite merit; he was my prisoner during the war, and is warmly attached to English manners and our glo∣rious constitution.—But, Creveit!—to know the merit of such a man, you must be acquainted with him.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is he an Englishman?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and you may judge of his merit as a soldier, when I tell you, he has risen from the ranks, at the age of three and twenty, to the com∣mission he now holds of captain. He's the reverse of this ill-fated boy we have been speaking to. He is self-educated; for with scarce any advantages but those he deriv'd from a most noble and ex∣cellent nature, he is the man of sense, the scholar, and the polish'd gentleman. His father, old Cre∣velt, was no more than a serjeant, and serv'd in Germany under Lord Granby; he brought this young man with him to India, whilst yet a boy; the first day he ever was in action, he saw his father fall; and he was found after the battle amongst the slain, close to his body, apparently lifeless with loss of blood, as if he had died in the pious office of defending a parent.</P>

<P>So much the reverse, that I am astonished at the appearance of opulence and prosperity to be met with every where; and the pleasing sensation. I feel, to find my country in that state, is inde∣scribable.</P>

<P>Let gloomy politicians continue to predict, and foresee calamities that exist only in imagina∣tion; whilst the genius of industry continues to smile upon the labours of the husbandman, the mechanic, and the manufacturer, and whilst strict probity is the character of England in her deal∣ings with all other nations, the resources of this country will be found inexhaustible; and though its glory may be veiled by a momentary cloud, it soon recovers its former splendour.</P>

<SPEAKER>Crev.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Charlotte! It is she, then, who is intended for Mr. Talbot;—I think I never saw a finer girl.</P>

<P>She's a divine creature! and though her Adonis is so near a relation, I confess, I wish her a better husband;—but I don't know how matters may terminate—She's a girl of great spirit—has a a very fine independency; and such is her disposi∣tion, that I'm confident there is no temptation in wealth could induce her to marry any man whom she did not like.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Johns.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, I understand she is the daughter of a Sir Oliver Oldstock; an old acquaintance of the Colonel's—her father, I hear, meant she shou'd marry Mr. Mandeville, supposing he wou'd be my master's heir; but when a son made his appear∣ance, like all worldly men, Sir Oliver chang'd his note; and the poor young lady is to become a sa∣crifice to this—I wish he wasn't my master's son.</P>

<P>But she won't, Johnson, be made a sacri∣fice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I hope not, Sir;—but, lord! what won't money do? Don't we see money every day couple age and deformity to youth and beauty; a young creature, like an angel, link'd to an old skeleton of dry bones—as if the Daemon of avarice and sin had acquir'd such ascendancy in the world, as to bring about an union betwixt death and immor∣tality?</P>

<P>Why, Johnson, you speak with great feeling and spirit on the subject.</P>

<P>Ah, Captain Crevelt! what a charming couple you two wou'd make—I, who have seen

<P>That was all my own thought: I haven't learnt to sence yet; and as I am told a gentleman is nobody till he has fought about a score duels, I was determined the first time I fought not to be overreach'd by any body.</P>

</SP>
<SP>

<P>Yes; fighting's quite a gentleman-like amusement;—besides, it will be put in the news∣papers; and I shall read my own name in print, along with the debates of Lords and Commons; and that's the cause, I suppose, of all duels.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir O.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well said, Monsieur! cart before the horse.—But now I am alone, let me see how my accounts stand: I haye secured the French nabob for my niece; now it would be a master stroke if I cou'd obtain the English one for my daughter, and thus center the two nabobs in my own family. This son of the Colonel's is a down right savage: Charlotte never cou'd like him; or if she cou'd, interest tells me I shou'd not; therefore her liking's out of the question: there's to be a division of the Colonel's property, between the son and Man∣deville: I want the whole, if possible. The Co∣lonel's not fifty, and in my mind he's a better look∣ing man than either his son or his nephew. Char∣lotte's having ten thousand pounds independent of me, makes her very obstinate; debates will run high, I fear; as, indeed, they very often do in my fa∣mily, where, tho' I'm constantly left in a mino∣rity, I never lose a question—'tis true, I have open mouths upon me from all sides, till, like greater men, I'm fairly badger'd: but it's only waiting till the strangers are all out, and I tell the house

<P>How convenient it is to assume ignorance of a subject on which it is painful to hear the truth, even to the man incapable of respecting it!

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir O.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word, Mr, Mandeville, you speak to me in a very strange stile; this is not a manner in which I am accustom'd to be address'd. You bounce in all of a sudden, transported with rage, for what cause is best known to yourself, and with a knock-me-down countenance, treat me as if my age and my rank had no kind of respect due to them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, no man honours age more than I; or more readily yields rank every respect it can claim, when that rank does not forfeit its title to esteem, by meanly sinking and degrading itself:—but, when men in superior stations behave as if their actions were above all censure and control, they must be told that they are deceiving themselves, as well as the world, and that no man is suffer'd to injure another with impunity.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir O.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Mandeville, the poet says, that "Every day's a satire on the last;" now I say that every day's a contradiction to the last; as circum∣stances vary, or events fall out, we are compelled by necessity to change our minds. As to my niece, whom I consider in the light of a daughter, I think it my duty, in providing her with a husband, to make the best bargain I can for her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, have you no regard to what the world will say on this occasion? The world, Sir; that harsh, blind, misjudging multitude; whose slan∣der, if it soil the ermine purity of virtue, what will it say, when it has justice upon its side?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir O.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing that I value—Young man, when you have lived as many years with the world as I have, you'll learn to make your happiness inde∣pendent of its opinion—Don't you see knaves and fools every day rise into consequence, and all from the opinion of the world—the opinion of the world, Sir! It's a mouthful of moonshine!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe with you that the world is too indolent—too much occupied with its pleasures, or its miseries, to take up the business of a censor—I fear it never examines thoroughly, any man's pretensions to its favour: the more he asks, the more he generally obtains from the world; hence, folly, confidence and vice, revel in the arms of luxury, whilst merit, proud, and retiring from the conscious dignity of genius and virtue, is suffer'd to perish for want of bread!—But, Sir—</P>

<P>But me no more this debate, Mr. Man∣deville—the question is put, and I am going.— Partial as I am to a polemical mode of discourse, I find that there may be sometimes even too much contradiction.</P>

<P>What shall I do with this deceitful, un∣feeling man? But can I hesitate whilst I have a particle of spirit left? I'll go this moment, state the matter to Count Pierpoint, and he shall resign, or fight for his mistress!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Mandeville, what is the matter?— My uncle has just parted from you, seemingly much out of temper, and the wildness and disorder of your looks, terrify me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>My heart is torn to pieces, Harriet—Indignation at the ungenerous treatment I have met with from your uncle, added to my fears of losing you, distract me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>But can you doubt your Harriet? There is no power upon earth shall force me to be ano∣ther's; do then, dear Mandeville! strive to calm this tumult in your mind—Betrayed by the vio∣lence of your passion, you talk'd of going in search of Count Pierpoint—let me beseech you not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>You were deceived, Harrier, in what you heard me say—do not prevent my going—I have business of a most particular nature calls me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know perfectly the business that calls you—but let me conjure you, by all that regard you ever profess'd for me, not to think of it—You say your fears of losing me, distract you—judge then of the state of my heart, by your own—Has Harriet no fears for her Mandeville, at a moment, she sees him eat up with an ungovernable rage—
<PB N="48" REF="55"/>
about, perhaps, to hurry himself, or a fellow∣creature into eternity?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your apprehensions, Harriet, are ground∣less—from what I learn of the Count's character, I believe him to be a man of too nice honour; too equitable, too generous, to reduce me to the necessity of proceeding to extremities; I only wish to explain matters to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can recommend a much better course to you, and one much more likely to succeed—Go to your uncle, that good, that noble-hearted man —tell him your story—if any body has weight with Sir Oliver, it is Colonel Talbot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nobody has weight with him, when ava∣rice claims his ear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are mistaken: he is not so great a slave to avarice as you suppose him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is your uncle, Harriet, and I cannot speak of him with harshness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know by your eyes, you are not so angry as you were.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will be guided by you in every thing—There is a fascinating power, Harriet, in your looks and accents, when you wou'd persuade, that cannot be resisted; a melting softness clings about my heart as I listen and behold you; there is sure a divinity in angel-beauty! You caused the tem∣pest in my soul, and have calm'd it.</P>

<P>I protest you spoke those last words with so serious an air, that I'm half inclined to think you're in love yourself: if that be the case, come, make me your confidante; I'll be as secret and as silent as Shakespeare's own marble Grief and Patience: I have the music of the Avon swan this moment at my heart, and cou'd hear a lover whisper his tale under a tree in which the

<P>And is that strange, Sir, when I come with Shakespeare in my hand; a master who teaches the whole history of the passions? His keen and ardent eye in a fine frenzy rolling, pierced into the secret chambers of the heart where the passions slumber; and woke them, as he swept his lyre divine to all their changeful moods of pain and joy, till kindled up to madness, or to ecstasy; but, when he touches upon love, though the flash be momentary, it resembles lightning, suddenly rift∣ing the surface of the earth, and disclosing the ra∣diant portal of a diamond quarry.</P>

<P>Were I to wish another laurel on the grave of Shakespeare, it should be planted by the hand of so charming a commentator.</P>

<P>Sir, there is a laurel already planted on his grave by one of our sex, which will flourish till the spirit of his genius, and his writings are no more remembered—but to the point—I have pronoune'd you in love; now let me know who your mistress is?</P>

<P>Well, and if I do change my mind often, isn't it for your good? As one project starts up in my mind better than another, in order to take ad∣vantage of that, I must naturally contradict myself. The Spanish proverb says, a wise man often changes his mind, a fool never.</P>

<P>According to that proverb you should be a second Solomon: who you intend for me next I cannot possibly guess; but as I never will marry without your consent, I trust it will not be deem∣ed undutiful, if I always retain a negative to my∣self, in a matter which so nearly concerns my hap∣piness as the choice of a husband.</P>

<P>Why, Fanny, my love, what's the mat∣er? you were very well when I went out.</P>

<P>Ah! you're a happy couple; but you take the right method to be so, by giving way to one another.</P>

<P>But now we are up stairs, friend Amber sit down, and I'll go bring some money out of the next room and pay you.</P>

<P>What shall I do? I'm afraid to leave the room.</P>

<P>But dear Colonel, sure you won't believe what this wicked woman will say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Away, villain, and let me hear her—alarmed nature starts up in my heart, and opens a thousand ears to listen to her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Wilk.</SPEAKER>
<P>He lost your son, Sir, when he was a boy of twelve years old; and you may be sure. Sir, it wasn't the kindest usage made the child leave him; the booby he palmed upon you is his own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Unprincipled, inhuman villain! let me hear the whole truth from your own lips, or by every power that's sacred and divine, this moment is your last.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Sir, put up your sword, and I'll tell you every thing—What she says is partly true; your son strayed from me when he was about twelve years old; but had he been my own, I cou'dn't have used him better: as a proof of it, his mother, in her last illness, came, as she often did, privately to see him, and was so well pleased with my wife's and my treatment of her son, that she gave me a fifty-pound Bank note—I shall never forget the day; it was the last time I ever saw her: she hung a small picture of herself, set in gold, about the child's neck, and wept bitterly over him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can you produce that picture?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your son took it with him; he was so fond of it, I cou'd never keep it out of his hands but by locking it up; which I sometimes did, as
<PB N="76" REF="83"/>
the severest of all punishments I cou'd inflict upon him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must have better proof this tale is true, before I let you escape that justice I fear is due to your wickedness.—Johnson, take him from my sight, and let him be secur'd; I cannot bear to look at him.— Tell the company waiting for me in car∣riages at the door, to come in; for I am so agi∣tated, and anxious for more particulars, I cannot quit this detested spot.</P>

<P>Oh, Crevelt! I am the unhappiest of fa∣thers; that creature whom you all suppose my son, is not so.</P>

<P>Good fortune be prais'd!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>He's son to the fellow who keeps this house—He says, my poor child stray'd from him when a boy; but this tale is so improbable, that I rather fear he has fall'n a victim to this fellow's villany and avarice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crev.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Sir, compose yourself, and hope hu∣man nature cannot be so deprav'd; it wrings my heart to see you in this distress—But who is this villain?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>His name is Wilkins.—When I committed my child to his care, he lived at Henly: he pre∣tends he lost him at twelve years old; and, oh! agony to think! if he, indeed, be living, he is at this moment a wandering outcast and a beggar.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crev.</SPEAKER>
<P>Merciful heaven! What do I hear? Can
<PB N="77" REF="84"/>
it be possible! Shall I, to my lov'd and honour'd patron, find a fond and living father? Sir, did that man lose a son of yours at twelve years of age?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Crevelt; I have no son but you now.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>You! You, Crevelt!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crev.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, the veteran, whose name I bear, took me with him at the age you mention from Henly; where I lived with the man you have just named, whom I always thought my father; it was the pride of poor Crevelt's heart to have me believed his son: I bore his name, and publicly acknowledged him as my father; for you, Sir, could not have lov'd me better; his dying request to me was, still to retain the name of Crevelt, and never forget the man who made me a soldier.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>My son! my son! The hand of Providence has surely directed every circumstance of your life; you were brought to me a stranger and a child; I became your parent by resistless instinct; in battle once I owed my life to you, and now a second time you save it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! Harriet. There is a chord of delight in my heart never touch'd before: and sure, he who made that heart, now moves its springs to ecstasy by the finger of an angel.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>He talk'd of your taking with you a pic∣ture of your mother—had you ever any such thing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crev.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have it still, Sir, and ever wore it next my heart. <STAGE>(Producing the picture from his bosom.)</STAGE> You see the frame is shattered;—it was by a mus∣quet ball the day every body thought I was kill'd.</P>
</SP>

<LG>
<L>NOW critic Jove the scale aloft suspends;</L>
<L>On whose dread beam the poet's fate depends:</L>
<L>Ye gods above, high arbiters of wit,</L>
<L>Who on your shilling thrones in council sit;</L>
<L>You I implore, for our poor bard afraid,</L>
<L>To grant celestial, upper-gall'ry aid;</L>
<L>If you approve, with Cato I shall cry</L>
<L>The gods take care of poets in the sky!</L>
<L>As for the ladies—they'll sure hear my pray'r,</L>
<L>New charms good-nature lends the fairest fair;</L>
<L>Besides, I hardly think they can be foes,</L>
<L>To a fond maid who a brave soldier chose.</L>
<L>Who like a soldier charms the fair one's eyes,</L>
<L>The queen of beauty was a soldier's prize?</L>
<L>In love as war, the brave man best succeeds,</L>
<L>Our sex reveres that valour which it needs.</L>
<L>Ye beaux, so finely waisted now-a-days,</L>
<L>That one wou'd almost swear you put on stays;</L>
<L>You, I confess, create no great alarm,</L>
<L>You hav'nt spirit to do good, or harm.</L>
<L>But yonder I espy some dangerous faces;</L>
<L>Good critics, I entreat your favouring graces:</L>
<L>All I request is, when a fault's set down,</L>
<L>Its neighbouring beauty may be told the town;</L>
<L>But after this, if you attempt to growl,</L>
<L>I'll excommunicate you, every soul!</L>
<L>In my lawn sleeves and shirt, I'll come so big,</L>
<L>In every thing a bishop, but his wig:</L>
<L>Nay, if you doubt, an army I will bring</L>
<L>Of bishops, who may crown the greatest king:</L>
<L>Their sleeves of lawn, the down-wings of the dove;</L>
<L>Their sash, the cestus of the queen of love:</L>
<L>With aid like this, and aid you'll own divine,</L>
<L>Who wou'd not think success were surely mine?</L>
<L>In anxious hope I wait the dread decree,</L>
<L>That must be final both to bard and me.</L>
