<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE love of novelty, which, in some degree, is common to all mankind, is more particularly the characteristic of that mediocrity of parts, which distinguishes more than one half of the human species. This inconstant disposition is never more conspicuous, than in what regards the article of amusement. We change our sentiments concerning it every moment, and the dis∣tance between our admiration and extreme contempt, is so very small, that the one is almost a sure presage of the other. The poets, whose business it is to please, if they want to preserve the fame they have once acquired, must very often forfeit their own judgments to this variable temper of the bulk of their readers, and accommodate their writings to this unsettled taste. A fame so fluctuating deserves not to be much valued.</P>
<P>POETRY, like virtue, receives its reward after death. The fame which men pursued in vain, when living, is often bestowed upon them when they are not sensible of it. This neglect of living authors is not altogether to be attributed to that reluctance which men shew in praising and rewarding genius. It often happens, that
<PB REF="6"/>
the man who writes differs greatly from the same man in common life. His foibles, however, are obliterated by death, and his better part, his writings, remain: his character is formed from them, and he that was no extraordinary man in his own time, becomes the wonder of succeeding ages.—From this source proceeds our vene∣ration for the dead. Their virtues remain, but the vices, which were once blended with their virtues, have died with themselves.</P>
<P>THIS consideration might induce a man, diffident of his abilities, to ascribe his own compositions to a person, whose remote antiquity and whose situation, when alive, might well answer for faults which would be inexcusable in a writer of this age. An ingenious gentle∣man made this observation, before he knew any thing but the name of the epic poem, which is printed in the following collection. When he had read it, his sentiments were changed. He found it abounded too much with those ideas, that only belong to the most early state of society, to be the work of a modern poet. Of this, I am persuaded, the public will be as thoroughly convinced, as this gentleman was, when they shall see the poems; and that some will think, notwithstanding the disadvantages with which the works ascrib∣ed to Ossian appear, it would be a very uncommon instance of self∣denial in me to disown them, were they really of my composition.</P>
<P>I WOULD not have dwelt so long upon this subject, especially as I have answered all reasonable objections to the genuineness of the poems in the Dissertation, were it not on account of the prejudices of the present age against the ancient inhabitants of Britain, who are thought to have been incapable of the generous sentiments to be met with in the poems of Ossian.—If we err in praising too much the times of our forefathers, it is also as repugnant to good sense,
<PB REF="7"/>
to be altogether blind to the imperfections of our own. If our fa∣thers had not so much wealth, they had certainly fewer vices than the present age. Their tables, it is true, were not so well provided, neither were their beds so soft as those of modern times; and this, in the eyes of men who place their ultimate happiness in those conve∣niences of life, gives us a great advantage over them. I shall not enter farther into this subject, but only observe, that the general poverty of a nation has not the same influence, that the indigence of indivi∣duals, in an opulent country, has, upon the manners of the com∣munity. The idea of meanness, which is now connected with a narrow fortune, had its rise after commerce had thrown too much property into the hands of a sew; for the poorer sort, imitating the vices of the rich, were obliged to have recourse to roguery and cir∣cumvention, in order to supply their extravagance, so that they were, not without reason, reckoned, in more than one sense, the worst of the people.</P>
<P>IT is now two years since the first translations from the Galic language were handed about among people of taste in Scotland. They became at last so much corrupted, through the carelessness of transcribers, that, for my own sake, I was obliged to print the ge∣nuine copies. Some other pieces were added, to swell the publica∣tion into a pamphlet, which was entitled, Fragments of Ancient Poetry.—The Fragments, upon their first appearance, were so much approved of, that several people of rank, as well as taste, prevailed with me to make a journey into the Highlands and western isles, in order to recover what remained of the works of the old bards, espe∣cially those of Ossian, the son of Fingal, who was the best, as well as most ancient, of those who are celebrated in tradition for their poetical genius.—I undertook this journey, more from a desire
<PB REF="8"/>
of complying with the request of my friends, than from any hopes I had of answering their expectations. I was not unsucessful, con∣sidering how much the compositions of ancient times have been neglected, for some time past, in the north of Scotland. Seve∣ral gentlemen in the Highlands and isles generously gave me all the assistance in their power; and it was by their means I was en∣abled to compleat the epic poem. How far it comes up to the rules of the epopaea, is the province of criticism to examine. It is only my business to lay it before the reader, as I have found it. As it is one of the chief beauties of composition, to be well un∣derstood, I shall here give the story of the poem, to prevent that obscurity which the introduction of characters utterly unknown might occasion.</P>
<P>ARTHO, supreme king of Ireland, dying at Temora the royal palace of the Irish kings, was succeeded by Cormac, his son, a minor. Cuchullin, the son of Semo, lord of the <HI>Isle of Mist,</HI> one of the Hebrides, being at that time in Ulster, and very famous for his great exploits, was, in a convention of the petty kings and heads of tribes assembled for that purpose at Temora, unanimously chosen guardian to the young king.—He had not managed the affairs of Cormac long, when news was brought, that Swaran, the son of Starno, king of Lochlin, or Scandinavia, intended to invade Ireland. Cuchullin immediately dispatched Munan, the son of Stirmal, an Irish chief, to Fingal, king of those Caledonians who inhabited the western coast of Scotland, to implore his aid. Fingal, as well from a principle of generosity, as from his connection with the royal family of Ire∣land, resolved on an expedition into that country; but before his arrival, the enemy had landed in Ulster.—Cuchullin in the mean time had gathered the flower of the Irish tribes to Tura, a castle of
<PB REF="9"/>
Ulster, and dispatched scouts along the coast, to give the most early intelligence of the enemy.—Such is the situation of affairs, when the poem opens.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fing. B. I.</NOTE> CUCHULLIN, sitting alone beneath a tree, at the gate of Tura, for the other chiefs had gone on a hunting party to Cromla, a neighbouring hill, is informed of Swaran's landing by Moran, the son of Fithil, one of his scouts. He convenes the chiefs; a council is held, and disputes run high about giving battle to the enemy. Connal, the petty king of Togorma, and an intimate friend of Cuchullin, was for retreating till Fingal should arrive; but Calmar, the son of Matha, lord of Lara, a country in Connaught, was for engaging the enemy immediately.—Cuchullin, of himself willing to fight, went into the opinion of Calmar. Marching towards the enemy, he missed three of his bravest heroes, Fergus, Duchomar, and Caithbat. Fergus arriving, tells Cuchullin of the death of the two other chiefs; which introduces the affecting episode of Morna, the daughter of Cormac—The army of Cuchullin is descried at a distance by Swaran, who sent the son of Arno to observe the mo∣tions of the enemy, while he himself ranged his forces in order of battle.—The son of Arno returning to Swaran, describes to him Cuchullin's chariot, and the terrible appearance of that hero. The armies engage, but night coming on, leaves the victory unde∣cided. Cuchullin, according to the hospitality of the times, sends to Swaran a formal invitation to a feast, by his bard Carril, the son of Kinsena.—Swaran refuses to come. Carril relates to Cuchullin the story of Grudar and Brassolis. A party, by Connal's advice, is sent to observe the enemy; which closes the action of the first day.</P>
<P><PB REF="10" MS="y"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">B. II.</NOTE> THE ghost of Crugal, one of the Irish heroes who was killed in battle, appearing to Connal, foretels the defeat of Cuchullin in the next battle; and earnestly advises him to make peace with Swaran. Connal communicates the vision; but Cuchullin is inflexible from a principle of honour that he would not be the first to sue for peace, and resolved to continue the war. Morning comes; Swaran pro∣poses dishonourable terms to Cuchullin, which are rejected. The battle begins, and is obstinately fought for some time, until, upon the flight of Grumal, the whole Irish army gave way. Cuchullin and Connal cover their retreat: Carril leads them to a neighbouring hill, whither they are soon followed by Cuchullin himself, who descries the fleet of Fingal making towards the coast; but, night coming on, he lost sight of it again. Cuchullin, dejected after his de∣feat, attributes his ill success to the death of Ferda his friend, whom he had killed some time before. Carril, to shew that ill success did not always attend those who innocently killed their friends, intro∣duces the episode of Comal and Galvina.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">B. III.</NOTE> CUCHULLIN, pleased with Carril's story, insists with him for more of his songs. The bard relates the actions of Fingal in Lochlin, and death of Agandecca the beautiful sister of Swaran. He had scarce finished when Calmar the son of Matha, who had advised the first battle, came wounded from the field, and told them of Swaran's design to surprise the remains of the Irish army. He himself proposes to withstand singly the whole force of the enemy, in a narrow pass, till the Irish should make good their retreat. Cuchullin, touched with the gallant proposal of Calmar, resolves to accompany him, and orders Carril to carry off the few that remained of the Irish. Morning comes, Calmar dies of his wounds; and, the ships of the Caledo∣nians appearing, Swaran gives over the pursuit of the Irish, and re∣turns
<PB REF="11"/>
to oppose Fingal's landing. Cuchullin ashamed, after his de∣feat, to appear before Fingal, retires to the cave of Tura. Fingal engages the enemy, puts them to flight; but the coming on of night makes the victory not decisive. The king, who had observed the gallant behaviour of his grandson Oscar, gives him advices con∣cerning his conduct in peace and war. He recommends to him to place the example of his fathers before his eyes, as the best model for his conduct; which introduces the episode concerning Fainasól∣lis, the daughter of the king of Craca, whom Fingal had taken un∣der his protection, in his youth. Fillan and Oscar are dispatched to observe the motions of the enemy by night; Gaul the son of Morni desires the command of the army, in the next battle; which Fingal promises to give him. The song of the bards closes the third day.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">B. IV.</NOTE> THE action of the poem being suspended by night, Ossian takes that opportunity to relate his own actions at the lake of Lego, and his courtship of Evirallin, who was the mother of Oscar, and had died some time before the expedition of Fingal into Ireland. Her ghost appears to him, and tells him that Oscar, who had been sent, the beginning of the night, to observe the enemy, was engaged with an advanced party, and almost overpowered. Ossian relieves his son; and an alarm is given to Fingal of the approach of Swaran. The king rises, calls his army together, and, as he had promised the preceding night, devolves the command on Gaul the son of Morni, while he himself, after charging his sons to behave gallantly and defend his people, retires to a hill, from whence he could have a view of the battle. The battle joins; the poet relates Oscar's great actions. But when Oscar, in conjunction with his father, con∣quered in one wing, Gaul, who was attacked by Swaran in person,
<PB REF="12"/>
was on the point of retreating in the other. Fingal sends Ullin his bard to encourage him with a war song, but notwithstanding Swaran prevails; and Gaul and his army are obliged to give way. Fingal, descending from the hill, rallies them again: Swaran desists from the pursuit, possesses himself of a rising ground, restores the ranks, and waits the approach of Fingal. The king, having encouraged his men, gives the necessary orders, and renews the battle. Cuchullin, who, with his friend Connal, and Carril his bard, had retired to the cave of Tura, hearing the noise, came to the brow of the hill, which overlooked the field of battle, where he saw Fingal engaged with the enemy. He, being hindered by Connal from joining Fin∣gal, who was himself upon the point of obtaining a complete vic∣tory, sends Carril to congratulate that hero on his success.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">B. V.</NOTE> IN the mean time Fingal and Swaran meet; the combat is de∣scribed: Swaran is overcome, bound and delivered over as a prisoner to the care of Ossian and Gaul the son of Morni; Fingal, his younger sons, and Oscar, still pursue the enemy. The episode of Orla a chief of Lochlin, who was mortally wounded in the battle, is in∣troduced. Fingal, touched with the death of Orla, orders the pursuit to be discontinued; and calling his sons together, he is in∣formed that Ryno, the youngest of them, was killed. He laments his death, hears the story of Lamdarg and Gelchossa, and returns towards the place where he had left Swaran. Carril, who had been sent by Cuchullin to congratulate Fingal on his victory, comes in the mean time to Ossian. The conversation of the two poets closes the action of the fourth day.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">B. VI.</NOTE> NIGHT comes on. Fingal gives a seast to his army, at which Swaran is present. The king commands Ullin his bard to give the
<PB REF="13"/>
<HI>song of peace;</HI> a custom always observed at the end of a war. Ullin relates the actions of Trenmor, great grandfather to Fingal, in Scan∣dinavia, and his marriage with Inibaca, the daughter of a king of Lochlin who was ancestor to Swaran; which consideration, toge∣ther with his being brother to Agandecca, with whom Fingal was in love in his youth, induced the king to release him, and permit him to return, with the remains of his army, into Lochlin, upon his promise of never returning to Ireland, in a hostile manner. The night is spent in settling Swaran's departure, in songs of bards, and in a conversation in which the story of Grumal is introduced by Fingal. Morning comes. Swaran departs; Fingal goes on a hunt∣ing party, and finding Cuchullin in the cave of Tura, comforts him, and sets sail, the next day, for Scotland; which concludes the poem.</P>
<P>THE story of this poem is so little interlarded with fable, that one cannot help thinking it the genuine history of Fingal's expedi∣tion, embellished by poetry. In that case, the compositions of Os∣sian are not less valuable for the light they throw on the ancient state of Scotland and Ireland than they are for their poetical merit. Succeeding generations founded on them all their traditions con∣cerning that period; and they magnified or varied them, in propor∣tion as they were swayed by credulity or design. The bards of Ireland, by ascribing to Ossian compositions which are evidently their own, have occasioned a general belief, in that country, that Fingal was of Irish extraction, and not of the ancient Caledonians, as is said in the genuine poems of Ossian. The inconsistencies be∣tween those spurious pieces prove the ignorance of their authors. In one of them Ossian is made to mention himself as baptised by St. Patrick, in another he speaks of the famous crusade, which was not begun in Europe for many centuries after.</P>
<P><PB REF="14"/>
THOUGH this anachronism quite destroys the authority of the bards with respect to Fingal; yet their desire to make him their countryman shews how famous he was in Ireland as well as in the north of Scotland.</P>
<P>HAD the Senachies of Ireland been as well acquainted with the antiquities of their nation as they pretended, they might derive as much honour from Fingal's being a Caledonian, as if he had been an Irishman; for both nations were almost the same people in the days of that hero. The Celtae, who inhabited Britain and Ireland before the invasion of the Romans, though they were divided into numerous tribes, yet, as the same language and customs, and the me∣mory of their common origin remained among them, they considered themselves as one nation. After South Britain became a province of Rome, and its inhabitants begun to adopt the language and customs of their conquerors, the Celtae beyond the pale of the empire, con∣sidered them as a distinct people, and consequently treated them as enemies. On the other hand, the strictest amity subsisted between the Irish and Scots Celtae for many ages, and the customs and an∣cient language of both still remaining, leave no room to doubt that they were of old one and the same nation.</P>
<P>IT was at first intended to prefix to Ossian's poems a discourse con∣cerning the ancient inhabitants of Britain; but as a gentleman, in the north of Scotland, who has thoroughly examined the antiquities of this island, and is perfectly acquainted with all the branches of the Celtic tongue, is just now preparing for the press a work on that subject, the curious are referred to it.</P>

<HEAD>A DISSERTATION CONCERNING THE ANTIQUITY, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the POEMS of OSSIAN the Son of FINGAL.</HEAD>
<P>INQUIRIES into the antiquities of nations afford more pleasure than any real advantage to mankind. The ingenious may form systems of history on probabilities and a few facts; but at a great distance of time, their accounts must be vague and uncertain. The infancy of states and kingdoms is as destitute of great events, as of the means of transmitting them to posterity. The arts of polished life, by which alone facts can be preserved with certainty, are the production of a well formed community. It is then historians begin to write, and public transactions to be worthy remembrance. The actions of former times are left in obscurity, or magnified by uncer∣tain traditions. Hence it is that we find so much of the marvellous in the origin of every nation; posterity being always ready to believe any thing, however fabulous, that reflects honour on their ancestors. The Greeks and Romans were remarkable for this weakness. They swallowed the most absurd fables concerning the high antiquities of their respective nations. Good historians, however, rose very early
<PB N="ii" REF="16"/>
amongst them, and transmitted, with lustre, their great actions to posterity. It is to them that they owe that unrivalled fame they now enjoy, while the great actions of other nations are involved in fables, or lost in obscurity. The Celtic nations afford a striking in∣stance of this kind. They, though once the masters of Europe from the mouth of the river Oby, in Russia, to Cape Finistere, the western point of Gallicia in Spain, are very little mentioned in hi∣story.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lin. l. 6.</NOTE> They trusted their fame to tradition and the songs of their bards, which, by the vicissitude of human affairs, are long since lost. Their ancient language is the only monument that remains of them; and the traces of it being found in places so widely distant of each other, serves only to shew the extent of their ancient power, but throws very little light on their history.</P>
<P>OF all the Celtic nations, that which possessed old Gaul is the most renowned; not perhaps on account of worth superior to the rest, but for their wars with a people who had historians to trans∣mit the fame of their enemies, as well as their own, to posterity. Britain was first peopled by them, according to the testimony of the best authors;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Caes. l. 5. Tac. Agric. l. 1. c. 2.</NOTE> its situation in respect to Gaul makes the opinion pro∣bable; but what puts it beyond all dispute, is that the same cu∣stoms and language prevailed among the inhabitants of both in the days of Julius Caesar.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Caesar. Pomp. Mel. Tacitus.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE colony from Gaul possessed themselves, at first, of that part of Britain which was next to their own country; and spreading northward, by degrees, as they increased in numbers, peopled the whole island. Some adventurers passing over from those parts of Britain that are within sight of Ireland, were the founders of the Irish nation: which is a more probable story than the idle fables of Milesian and Gallician colonies. Diodorus Siculus mentions it<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dio. Sic. l. 5.</NOTE> as a
<PB N="iii" REF="17"/>
thing well known in his time, that the inhabitants of Ireland were originally Britons; and his testimony is unquestionable, when we consider that, for many ages, the language and customs of both na∣tions were the same.</P>
<P>TACITUS was of opinion that the ancient Caledonians were of German extract. By the language and customs which always pre∣vailed in the North of Scotland, and which are undoubtedly Celtic, one would be tempted to differ in opinion from that celebrated wri∣ter. The Germans, properly so called, were not the same with the ancient Celtae. The manners and customs of the two nations were similar; but their language different. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Strabo 1. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> The Germans are the ge∣nuine descendants of the ancient Daae, afterwards well known by the name of Daci, and passed originally into Europe by the way of the northern countries, and settled beyond the Danube, towards the vast regions of Transilvania, Wallachia, and Moldavia; and from thence advanced by degrees into Germany. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Caes. l. 6. Liv. l. 5. Tac. de mor. Germ.</NOTE> The Celtae, it is cer∣tain, sent many Colonies into that country, all of whom retained their own laws, language, and customs; and it is of them, if any colonies came from Germany into Scotland, that the ancient Caledonians were descended.</P>
<P>BUT whether the Caledonians were a colony of the Celtic Ger∣mans, or the same with the Gauls that first possessed themselves of Britain, is a matter of no moment at this distance of time. What∣ever their origin was, we find them very numerous in the time of Julius Agricola, which is a presumption that they were long before settled in the country. The form of their government was a mix∣ture of aristocracy and monarchy, as it was in all the countries where the Druids bore the chief sway. This order of men seems to have been formed on the same system with the Dactyli Idaei and Curetes
<PB N="iv" REF="18"/>
of the ancients. Their pretended intercourse with heaven, their magic and divination were the same. The knowledge of the Druids in natural causes, and the properties of certain things, the fruit of the experiments of ages gained them a mighty reputation among the people. The esteem of the populace soon increased into a venera∣tion for the order; which a cunning and ambitious tribe of men took care to improve, to such a degree, that they, in a manner, in∣grossed the management of civil, as well as religious, matters. It is generally allowed that they did not abuse this extraordinary power; the preserving their character of sanctity was so essential to their in∣fluence, that they never broke out into violence or oppression. The chiefs were allowed to execute the laws, but the legislative power was entirely in the hands of the Druids. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Caes. l. 6.</NOTE> It was by their authority that the tribes were united, in times of the greatest danger, under one head. This temporary king, or Vergobretus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fer-gu∣breth, <HI>the man to judge.</HI></NOTE> was chosen by them, and generally laid down his office at the end of the war. These priests enjoyed long this extraordinary privilege among the Celtic nations who lay beyond the pale of the Roman empire. It was in the beginning of the second century that their power among the Ca∣ledonians begun to decline. The poems that celebrate Trathal and Cormac, ancestors to Fingal, are full of particulars concerning the fall of the Druids, which account for the total silence concerning their religion in the poems that are now given to the public.</P>
<P>THE continual wars of the Caledonians against the Romans hin∣dered the nobility from initiating themselves, as the custom for∣merly was, into the order of the Druids. The precepts of their religion were confined to a few, and were not much attended to by a people inured to war. The Vergobretus, or chief magistrate, was chosen without the concurrence of the hierarchy, or continued in his office against their will. Continual power strengthened his in∣terest
<PB N="v" REF="19"/>
among the tribes, and enabled him to send down, as heredi∣tary to his posterity, the office he had only received himself by election.</P>
<P>On occasion of a new war against the <HI>King of the World,</HI> as the poems emphatically call the Roman emperor, the Druids, to vindi∣cate the honour of the order, began to resume their ancient privi∣lege of chusing the Vergobretus. Garmal, the son of Tarno, being deputed by them, came to the grandfather of the celebrated Fingal, who was then Vergobretus, and commanded him, in the name of the whole order, to lay down his office. Upon his refusal, a civil war commenced, which soon ended in almost the total extinction of the religious order of the Druids. A few that remained, retired to the dark recesses of their groves, and the caves they had formerly used for their meditations. It is then we find them in <HI>the circle of stones,</HI> and unheeded by the world. A total disregard for the order, and utter abhorrence of the Druidical rites ensued. Under this cloud of public hate, all that had any knowledge of the religion of the Druids became extinct, and the nation sell into the last degree of ignorance of their rites and ceremonies.</P>
<P>IT is no matter of wonder then, that Fingal and his son Ossian make so little, if any, mention of the Druids; who were the declared enemies to their succession in the supreme magistracy. It is a singular case, it must be allowed, that there are no traces of religion in the poems ascribed to Ossian; as the poetical compositions of other nations are so closely connected with their mythology. It is hard to account for it to those who are not made acquainted with the manner of the old Scottish bards. That race of men carried their notions of mar∣tial honour to an extravagant pitch. Any aid given their heroes in battle, was thought to derogate from their fame; and the bards
<PB N="vi" REF="20"/>
immediately transferred the glory of the action to him who had given that aid.</P>
<P>HAD Ossian brought down gods, as often as Homer hath done, to assist his heroes, this poem had not consisted of elogiums on his friends, but of hymns to these superior beings. To this day, those that write in the Galic language seldom mention religion in their profane poetry; and when they professedly write of religion, they never interlard with their compositions, the actions of their heroes. This custom alone, even though the religion of the Druids had not been previously extinguished, may, in some measure, account for Ossian's silence concerning the religion of his own times.</P>
<P>To say, that a nation is void of all religion, is the same thing as to say, that it does not consist of people endued with reason. The traditions of their fathers, and their own observations on the works of nature, together with that superstition which is inherent in the human frame, have, in all ages, raised in the minds of men some idea of a superior being.—Hence it is, that in the darkest times, and amongst the most barbarous nations, the very populace themselves had some faint notion, at least, of a divinity. It would be doing injustice to Ossian, who, upon no occasion, shews a narrow mind, to think, that he had not opened his conceptions to that primitive and greatest of all truths. But let Ossian's religion be what it will, it is certain he had no knowledge of Christianity, as there is not the least allusion to it, or any of its rites, in his poems; which absolutely fixes him to an aera prior to the introduction of that religion. The persecution begun by Dioclesian, in the year 303, is the most probable time in which the first dawning of Chri∣stianity in the north of Britain can be fixed.—The humane and mild character of Constantius Chlorus, who commanded then in
<PB N="vii" REF="21"/>
Britain, induced the persecuted Christians to take refuge under him. Some of them, through a zeal to propagate their tenets, or through fear, went beyond the pale of the Roman empire, and settled among the Caledonians; who were the more ready to hearken to their doctrines, as the religion of the Druids had been exploded so long before.</P>
<P>THESE missionaries, either through choice, or to give more weight to the doctrine they advanced, took possession of the cells and groves of the Druids; and it was from this retired life they had the name of <HI>Culdees,</HI> which in the language of the country<NOTE PLACE="marg">Culdich.</NOTE> signified <HI>sequestered persons.</HI> It was with one of the <HI>Culdees</HI> that Ossian, in his extreme old age, is said to have disputed concerning the Christian religion. This dispute is still extant, and is couched in verse, ac∣cording to the custom of the times. The extreme ignorance on the part of Ossian, of the Christian tenets, shews, that that religion had only been lately introduced, as it is not easy to conceive, how one of the first rank could be totally unacquainted with a religion that had been known for any time in the country. The dis∣pute bears the genuine marks of antiquity. The obsolete phrases and expressions peculiar to the times, prove it to be no forgery. If Ossian then lived at the introduction of Christianity, as by all ap∣pearance he did, his epoch will be the latter end of the third, and beginning of the fourth century. What puts this point beyond dis∣pute, is the allusion in his poems to the history of the times.</P>

A complete poem, which relates to this subject, is printed in this collection.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="22"/>
IN the year 210 the emperor Severus, after returning from his ex∣peditions against the Caledonians, at York fell into the tidious ill∣ness of which he afterwards died. The Caledonians and Maiatae, resuming courage from his indisposition, took arms in order to re∣cover the possessions they had lost. The enraged emperor com∣manded his army to march into their country, and to destroy it with fire and sword. His orders were but ill executed, for his son, Ca∣racalla, was at the head of the army, and his thoughts were entirely taken up with the hopes of his father's death, and with schemes to supplant his brother Geta.—He scarcely had entered the enemy's country, when news was brought him that Severus was dead.—A sudden peace is patched up with the Caledonians, and, as it appears from Dion Cassius, the country they had lost to Severus was re∣stored to them.</P>
<P>THE Caracul of Fingal is no other than Caracalla, who, as the son of Severus, the Emperor of Rome, whose dominions were ex∣tended almost over the known world, was not without reason called in the poems of Ossian, <HI>the Son of the King of the World.</HI> The space of time between 211, the year Severus died, and the begin∣ning of the fourth century, is not so great, but Ossian the son of Fingal, might have seen the Christians whom the persecution under Dioclesian had driven beyond the pale of the Roman empire.</P>
<P>OSSIAN, in one of his many lamentations on the death of his beloved son Oscar, mentions among his great actions, a battle which he fought against Caros, king of ships, on the banks of the winding Carun.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Car-avon, <HI>Winding ri∣ver.</HI></NOTE> It is more than probable, that the Caros mentioned here, is the same with the noted usurper Carausius, who assumed the purple in the year 287, and seizing on Britain, defeated the emperor Maximian Herculius, in several naval engagements, which gives propriety to
<PB N="ix" REF="23"/>
his being called in Ossian's poems, <HI>the King of Ships.</HI> The <HI>winding Carun</HI> is that small river retaining still the name of Carron, and runs in the neighbourhood of Agricola's wall, which Carausius repaired to obstruct the incursions of the Caledonians. Several other passages in the poems allude to the wars of the Romans; but the two just mentioned clearly fix the epoch of Fingal to the third century; and this account agrees exactly with the Irish histories, which place the death of Fingal, the son of Comhal, in the year 283, and that of Oscar and their own celebrated Cairbre, in the year 296.</P>
<P>SOME people may imagine, that the allusions to the Roman his∣tory might have been industriously inserted into the poems, to give them the appearance of antiquity. This fraud must then have been committed at least three ages ago, as the passages in which the allusions are made, are alluded to often in the compositions of those times.</P>
<P>EVERY one knows what a cloud of ignorance and barbarism overspread the north of Europe three hundred years ago. The minds of men, addicted to superstition, contracted a narrowness that destroyed genius. Accordingly we find the compositions of those times trivial and puerile to the last degree. But let it be allowed, that, amidst all the untoward circumstances of the age, a genius might arise, it is not easy to determine what could induce him to give the honour of his compositions to an age so remote. We find no fact that he has advanced, to favour any designs which could be entertained by any man who lived in the fifteenth century. But should we suppose a poet, through humour, or for reasons which cannot be seen at this distance of time, would ascribe his own com∣positions to Ossian, it is next to impossible, that he could impose
<PB N="x" REF="24"/>
upon his countrymen, when all of them were so well acquainted with the traditional poems of their ancestors.</P>
<P>THE strongest objection to the authenticity of the poems now given to the public under the name of Ossian, is the improbability of their being handed down by tradition through so many centuries. Ages of barbarism some will say, could not produce poems abound∣ing with the disinterested and generous sentiments so conspicuous in the compositions of Ossian; and could these ages produce them, it is impossible but they must be lost, or altogether corrupted in a long succession of barbarous generations.</P>
<P>THESE objections naturally suggest themselves to men unac∣quainted with the ancient state of the northern parts of Britain. The bards, who were an inferior order of the Druids, did not share their bad fortune. They were spared by the victorious king, as it was through their means only he could hope for immortality to his fame. They attended him in the camp, and contributed to establish his power by their songs. His great actions were magni∣fied, and the populace, who had no ability to examine into his cha∣racter narrowly, were dazzled with his fame in the rhimes of the bards. In the mean time, men assumed sentiments that are rarely to be met with in an age of barbarism. The bards who were originally the disciples of the Druids, had their minds opened, and their ideas enlarged, by being initiated in the learning of that celebrated order. They could form a perfect hero in their own minds, and ascribe that character to their prince. The inferior chiefs made this ideal character the model of their conduct, and by degrees brought their minds to that generous spirit which breathes in all the poetry of the times. The prince, flattered by
<PB N="xi" REF="25"/>
his bards, and rivalled by his own heroes, who imitated his cha∣racter as described in the eulogies of his poets, endeavoured to excel his people in merit, as he was above them in station. This emulation continuing, formed at last the general character of the nation, happily compounded of what is noble in barbarity, and virtuous and generous in a polished people.</P>
<P>WHEN virtue in peace, and bravery in war, are the characteristics of a nation, their actions become interesting, and their fame worthy of immortality. A generous spirit is warmed with noble actions, and becomes ambitious of perpetuating them. This is the true source of that divine inspiration, to which the poets of all ages pre∣tended. When they found their themes inadequate to the warmth of their imaginations, they varnished them over with fables, sup∣plied by their own fancy, or furnished by absurd traditions. These fables, however ridiculous, had their abettors; posterity either im∣plicitly believed them, or through a vanity natural to mankind, pretended that they did. They loved to place the founders of their families in the days of fable, when poetry, without the fear of contradiction, could give what characters she pleased of her heroes. It is to this vanity that we owe the preservation of what remain of the works of Ossian. His poetical merit made his heroes famous in a country where heroism was much esteemed and admired. The posterity of these heroes, or those who pretended to be descended from them, heard with pleasure the culogiums of their ancestors; bards were employed to repeat the poems, and to record the con∣nection of their patrons with chiefs so renowned. Every chief in process of time had a bard in his family, and the office became at last hereditary. By the succession of these bards, the poems con∣cerning the ancestors of the family were handed down from ge∣neration to generation; they were repeated to the whole clan on
<PB N="xii" REF="26"/>
solemn occasions, and always alluded to in the new compositions o the bards. This custom came down near to our own times; and after the bards were discontinued, a great number in a clan retained by memory, or committed to writing, their compositions, and found∣ed the antiquity of their families on the authority of their poems.</P>
<P>THE use of letters was not known in the North of Europe till long after the institution of the bards: the records of the families of their patrons, their own, and more ancient poems were handed down by tradition. Their poetical compositions were admirably contrived for that purpose. They were adapted to music; and the most per∣fect harmony observed. Each verse was so connected with those which preceded or followed it, that if one line had been remember∣ed in a stanza, it was almost impossible to forget the rest. The ca∣dences followed in so natural a gradation, and the words were so adapted to the common turn of the voice, after it is raised to a cer∣tain key, that it was almost impossible, from a similarity of sound, to substitute one word for another. This excellence is peculiar to the Celtic tongue, and is perhaps to be met with in no other language. Nor does this choice of words clog the sense or weaken the expres∣sion. The numerous flections of consonants, and variation in de∣clension, make the language very copious.</P>
<P>THE descendants of the Celtae, who inhabited Britain and its isles, were not singular in this method of preserving the most precious monuments of their nation. The ancient laws of the Greeks were couched in verse, and handed down by tradition. The Spartans, through a long habit, became so fond of this custom, that they would never allow their laws to be committed to writing. The ac∣tions of great men, and the elogiums of kings and heroes were pre∣served in the same manner. All the historical monuments of the
<PB N="xiii" REF="27"/>
old Germans were comprehended in their ancient songs; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tacitus de mor. Germ.</NOTE> which were either hymns to their gods, or elegies in praise of their he∣roes, and were intended to perpetuate the great events in their na∣tion which were carefully interwoven them. This species of com∣position was not committed to writing, but delivered by oral tradi∣tion. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Abbé de la Bleterie Re∣marques sur la Germanie.</HI></NOTE> The care they took to have the poems taught to their chil∣dren, the uninterrupted custom of repeating them upon certain oc∣casions, and the happy measure of the verse, served to preserve them for a long time uncorrupted. This oral chronicle of the Germans was not forgot in the eighth century, and it probably would have re∣mained to this day, had not learning, which thinks every thing, that is not committed to writing, fabulous, been introduced. It was from poetical traditions that Garcillasso composed his account of the Yncas of Peru. The Peruvians had lost all other monuments of their history, and it was from ancient poems which his mother, a princess of the blood of the Yncas, taught him in his youth, that he collected the materials of his history. If other nations then, that had been often overun by enemies, and had sent abroad and received colonies, could, for many ages, preserve, by oral tradition, their laws and histories uncorrupted, it is much more probable that the ancient Scots, a people so free of intermixture with foreigners, and so strongly attached to the memory of their ancestors, had the works of their bards handed down with great purity.</P>
<P>IT will seem strange to some, that poems admired for many cen∣turies in one part of this kingdom should be hitherto unknown in the other; and that the British, who have carefully traced out the works of genius in other nations, should so long remain strangers to their own. This, in a great measure, is to be imputed to those who understood both languages and never attempted a translation. They, from being acquainted but with detached pieces, or from a
<PB N="xiv" REF="28"/>
modesty, which perhaps the present translator ought, in prudence, to have followed, despaired of making the compositions of their bards agreeable to an English reader. The manner of those com∣positions is so different from other poems, and the ideas so confined to the most early state of society, that it was thought they had not enough of variety to please a polished age.</P>
<P>THIS was long the opinion of the translator of the following col∣lection; and though he admired the poems, in the original, very early, and gathered part of them from tradition for his own amuse∣ment, yet he never had the smallest hopes of seeing them in an English dress. He was sensible that the strength and manner of both languages were very different, and that it was next to impos∣sible to translate the Galic poetry into any thing of tolerable English verse; a prose translation he could never think of, as it must neces∣sarily fall short of the majesty of an original. It was a gentleman, who has himself made a figure in the poetical world, that gave him the first hint concerning a literal prose translation. He tried it at his desire, and the specimen was approved. Other gentlemen were earnest in exhorting him to bring more to the light, and it is to their uncommon zeal that the world owes the Galic poems, if they have any merit.</P>
<P>IT was at first intended to make a general collection of all the an∣cient pieces of genius to be found in the Galic language; but the translator had his reasons for confining himself to the remains of the works of Ossian. The action of the poem that stands the first, was not the greatest or most celebrated of the exploits of Fingal. His wars were very numerous, and each of them afforded a theme which employed the genius of his son. But, excepting the present poem, those pieces are irrecoverably lost, and there only remain a few fragments
<PB N="xv" REF="29"/>
in the hands of the translator. Tradition has still preserved, in many places, the story of the poems, and many now living have heard them, in their youth, repeated.</P>
<P>THE complete work, now printed, would, in a short time, have shared the fate of the rest. The genius of the highlanders has suf∣fered a great change within these few years. The communication with the rest of the island is open, and the introduction of trade and manufactures has destroyed that leisure which was formerly dedicated to hearing and repeating the poems of ancient times. Many have now learned to leave their mountains, and seek their fortunes in a milder climate; and though a certain <HI>amor patriae</HI> may sometimes bring them back, they have, during their absence, imbibed enough of foreign manners to despise the customs of their ancestors. Bards have been long difused, and the spirit of genealogy has greatly sub∣sided. Men begin to be less devoted to their chiefs, and consan∣guinity is not so much regarded. When property is established, the human mind confines its views to the pleasure it procures. It does not go back to antiquity, or look forward to succeeding ages. The cares of life increase, and the actions of other times no longer amuse. Hence it is, that the taste for their ancient poetry is at a low ebb among the highlanders. They have not, however, thrown off the good qualities of their ancestors. Hospitality still subsists, and an uncommon civility to strangers. Friendship is inviolable, and re∣venge less blindly followed than formerly.</P>
<P>To say any thing, concerning the poetical merit of the poems, would be an anticipation on the judgment of the public. The poem which stands first in the collection is truly epic. The characters are strongly marked, and the sentiments breathe heroism. The subject of it is an invasion of Ireland by Swaran king of Lochlin, which is the
<PB N="xvi" REF="30"/>
name of Scandinavia in the Galic language. Cuchullin, general of the Irish tribes in the minority of Cormac king of Ireland, upon in∣telligence of the invasion, assembled his forces near Tura, a castle on the coast of Ulster. The poem opens with the landing of Swa∣ran, councils are held, battles fought, and Cuchullin is, at last, totally defeated. In the mean time, Fingal, king of Scotland, whose aid was sollicited before the enemy landed, arrived and expelled them from the country. This war, which continued but six days and as many nights, is, including the episodes, the whole story of the poem. The scene is the heath of Lena near a mountain called Cromleach in Ulster.</P>
<P>ALL that can be said of the translation, is that it is literal, and that simplicity is studied. The arrangement of the words in the original is imitated, and the inversions of the style observed. As the translator claims no merit from his version, he hopes for the indul∣gence of the public where he fails. He wishes that the imperfect semblance he draws, may not prejudice the world against an origi∣nal, which contains what is beautiful in simplicity, and grand in the sublime.</P>

<P>CUCHULLIN<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cuchullin the son of Semo and grand∣son to Caithbat a druid celebrated in tra∣dition for his wisdom and valour. Cu∣chullin when very young married Bragela the daughter of Sorglan, and passing over into Ireland, lived for some time with Con∣nal, grandson by a daughter to Congal the petty king of Ulster. His wisdom and valour in a short time gained him such reputation, that in the minority of Cor∣mac the supreme king of Ireland, he was chosen guardian to the young king, and sole manager of the war against Swaran king of Lochlin. After a series of great actions he was killed in battle somewhere in Connaught, in the twenty-seventh year of his age. He was so remarkable for his strength, that to describe a strong man it has passed into a proverb, <Q REND="inline">"He has the strength of Cuchullin."</Q> They shew the re∣mains of his palace at Dunscaich in the Isle of Skye; and a stone to which he bound his dog Luath, goes still by his name.</NOTE> sat by Tura's wall; by the tree of the rust∣ling leaf.—His spear leaned against the mossy rock.

a hero whom he slew in war; the scout<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Cuchullin having previous intelligence of the invasion intended by Swaran, sent scouts all over the coast of Ullin or Ulster, to give early notice of the first appearance of the enemy, at the same time that he sent Munan the son of Stirmal to implore the assistance of Fingal. He himself col∣lected the flower of the Irish youth to Tu∣ra, a castle on the coast, to stop the pro∣gress of the enemy till Fingal should arrive from Scotland. We may conclude from Cuchullin's applying so early for foreign aid, that the Irish were not then so numerous as they have since been; which is a great presumption against the high antiquities of that people. We have the testimony of Tacitus that one legion only was thought sufficient, in the time of Agricola, to re∣duce the whole island under the Roman yoke; which would not probably have been the case had the island been inhabited for any number of centuries before.</NOTE> of the ocean came Moran<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Moran signifies many; and Fithil, or rather Fili, <HI>an inferior bard.</HI></NOTE> the son of Fithil.</P>

art thou named, the Mighty Man, but many mighty men are seen from Tura's walls of wind.—He answered, like a wave on a rock, who in this land appears like me? Heroes stand not in my presence: they fall to earth beneath my hand. None can meet Swaran in the fight but Fingal, king of stormy hills. Once we wrestled on the heath of Malmor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Meal-mór—<HI>a great hill.</HI></NOTE>, and our heels overturned the wood. Rocks fell from their place; and rivulets, changing their course, fled murmuring from our strife. Three days we renewed our strife, and heroes stood at a distance and trembled. On the fourth, Fingal says, that the king of the ocean fell; but Swaran says, he stood. Let dark Cuchullin yield to him that is strong as the storms of Malmor.</P>
<P>No: replied the blue-eyed chief, I will never yield to man. Dark Cuchullin will be great or dead. Go, Fithil's son, and take my spear: strike the sounding shield of Cabait<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Cabait, or rather Cathbait, grandfather to the hero, was so remarkable for his va∣lour, that his shield was made use of to alarm his posterity to the battles of the fa∣mily.

It hangs at Tu∣ra's rustling gate; the sound of peace is not its voice. My heroes shall hear on the hill.</P>
<P>HE went and struck the bossy shield. The hills and their rocks replied. The sound spread along the wood: deer start by the lake of roes. Curach<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Cu-raoch signifies <HI>the madness of battle.</HI></NOTE> leapt from the sounding rock; and Connal of the bloody spear.

<P>CALMAR! slow replied the chief, I never fled, O Matha's son. I was swift with my friends in battle, but small is the fame of Con∣nal. The battle was won in my presence, and the valiant overcame. But, son of Semo, hear my voice, regard the ancient throne of Cormac. Give wealth and half the land for peace, till Fingal come with battle. Or, if war be thy choice, I lift the sword and spear. My joy shall be in the midst of thousands, and my soul brighten in the gloom of the fight.</P>
<P>To me, Cuchullin replies, pleasant is the noise of arms: pleasant as the thunder of heaven before the shower of Spring. But gather all the shining tribes that I may view the sons of war.

Thou hast fallen in darkness like a star, that shoots athwart the desart, when the traveller is alone, and mourns the transient beam. Say, said Semo's blue-eyed son, say how sell the chiefs of Erin?

CATHBAT, replied the hero, fell by the sword of Duchomar at the oak of the noisy streams. Duchomar came to Tura's cave, and spoke to the lovely Morna.</P>

<P>FROM the hill I return, O Morna, from the hill of the dark-brown hinds. Three have I slain with my bended yew.

<P>AND long shall Morna wait, Duchomar said, his blood is on my sword.—Long shall Morna wait for him. He fell at Branno's stream. High on Cromla I will raise his tomb, daughter of Cormac-cairbar; but fix thy love on Duchomar, his arm is strong as a storm.—</P>
<P>AND is the son of Torman fallen? said the maid of the tearful eye.

But give me that sword, my soe; I love the blood of Caithbat.</P>
<P>HE gave the sword to her tears; but she pierced his manly breast. He fell, like the bank of a mountain-stream; stretched out his arm and said;</P>
<P>DAUGHTER of Cormac-cairbar, thou hast slain Duchomar. The sword is cold in my breast: Morna, I feel it cold. Give me to Moina<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Moina, <HI>soft in temper and person.</HI></NOTE> the maid; Duchomar was the dream of her night. She will raise my tomb; and the hunter shall see it and praise me. But draw the sword from my breast; Morna, the steel is cold.</P>
<P>SHE came, in all her tears, she came, and drew it from his breast. He pierced her white side with steel; and spread her fair locks on the ground. Her bursting blood sounds from her side: and her white arm is stained with red. Rolling in death she lay and Tura's cave answered to her sighs.—</P>

The deep-moving strength of the sons of Erin.—The car, the car of battle comes, like the flame of death; the rapid car of Cuchullin, the noble son of Semo. It bends behind like a wave near a rock; like the golden mist of the heath. Its sides are embossed with stones, and sparkle like the sea round the boat of night. Of polished yew is its beam, and its seat of the smoothest bone. The sides are replenished with spears; and the bottom is the foot-stool of heroes. Before the right side of the car is seen the snorting horse. The high∣maned, broad-breasted, proud, high-leaping strong steed of the hill. Loud and resounding is his hoof; the spreading of his mane above is like that stream of smoke on the heath. Bright are the sides of the steed, and his name is Sulin-Sifadda.</P>
<P>BEFORE the left side of the car is seen the snorting horse.

The look of his blue-rolling eye is wide beneath the dark arch of his brow. His hair flies from his head like a flame, as bending forward he wields the spear. Fly, king of ocean, fly; he comes, like a storm, along the streamy vale.</P>
<P>WHEN did I fly, replied the king, from the battle of many spears? When did I fly, son of Arno, chief of the little soul?

Were it Fingal himself my soul should not darken before him.—Rise to the battle, my thousands; pour round me like the ecchoing main.

We find that the dogs of Tre∣nar are sensible at home of the death of their master, the very instant he is killed.—It was the opinion of the times, that the souls of heroes went immediately after death to the hills of their country, and the scenes they frequented the most happy time of their life.

It was on Cromla's shaggy side that Dorglas placed the deer<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The ancient manner of preparing feasts after hunting, is handed down by tradition.—A pit lined with smooth stones was made; and near it stood a heap of smooth flat stones of the flint kind.

The feast is smoaking wide.</P>
<P>CUCHULLIN, chief of Erin's war, resumed his mighty soul. He stood upon his beamy spear, and spoke to the son of songs; to Carril of other times, the gray-haired son of Kinfena<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Cean-feana, <HI>i. e. the head of the people.</HI></NOTE>. Is this feast spread for me alone and the king of Lochlin on Ullin's shore; far from the deer of his hills, and sounding halls of his feasts? Rise, Carril of other times, and carry my words to Swaran; tell him from the roaring of waters, that Cuchullin gives his feast. Here let him listen to the sound of my groves amidst the clouds of night.—For cold and bleak the blustering winds rush over the foam of his seas. Here let him praise the trembling harp, and hear the songs of heroes.</P>

OLD Carril went, with softest voice, and called the king of dark-brown shields. Rise from the skins of thy chace, rise, Swaran king of groves.—Cuchullin gives the joy of shells; par∣take the feast of Erin's blue-eyed chief. He answered like the sullen sound of Cromla before a storm. Though all thy daugh∣ters, Inisfail! should extend their arms of snow; raise high the heavings of their breasts, and softly roll their eyes of love; yet, fix∣ed as Lochlin's thousand rocks, here Swaran shall remain; till morn, with the young beams of my east, shall light me to the death of Cuchullin. Pleasant to my ear is Lochlin's wind. It rushes over my seas. It speaks aloft in all my shrowds, and brings my green forests to my mind; the green forests of Gormal that of∣ten ecchoed to my winds, when my spear was red in the chace of the boar. Let dark Cuchullin yield to me the ancient throne of Cormac, or Erin's torrents shall shew from their hills the red foam of the blood of his pride.</P>
<P>SAD is the sounds of Swaran's voice, said Carril of other times:—</P>
<P>Sad to himself alone, said the blue-eyed son of Semo. But, Car∣ril, raise thy voice on high, and tell the deeds of other times. Send thou the night away in song; and give the joy of grief. For many heroes and maids of love, have moved on Inis-fail.

IN other days<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This episode is introduced with pro∣priety. Calmar and Connal, two of the Irish heroes, had disputed warmly before the battle about engaging the enemy.

The poet obtained his aim, for we find Calmar and Connal perfectly recon∣ciled in the third book.</NOTE>, Carril replies, came the sons of Ocean to Erin. A thousand vessels bounded over the waves to Ullin's lovely plains. The sons of Inisfail arose to meet the race of dark-brown shields. Cairbar, first of men, was there, and Grudar, stately youth.

TAKE, Brassolis, Cairbar came and said, take, Brassolis, this shield of blood. Fix it on high within my hall, the armour of my foe. Her soft heart beat against her side. Distracted, pale, she flew.

<P>WHY, said the ruler of the car, comes Connal through my night? My spear might turn against the sound; and Cuchullin mourn the death of his friend. Speak, Connal, son of Colgar, speak, thy counsel is like the sun of heaven.</P>
<P>SON of Semo, replied the chief, the ghost of Crugal came from the cave of his hill.—The stars him-twinkled through his form; and his voice was like the sound of a distant stream.—He is a messenger of death.—He speaks of the dark and narrow house. Sue for peace, O chief of Dunscaich; or fly over the heath of Lena.</P>
<P>HE spoke to Connal, replied the hero, though stars dim-twinkled through his form. Son of Colgar, it was the wind that murmured

Hast thou enquired where is his cave? The house of the son of the wind? My sword might find that voice, and force his knowledge from him. And small is his knowledge, Connal, for he was here to day. He could not have gone beyond our hills, and who could tell him there of our death?</P>
<P>GHOSTS fly on clouds and ride on winds, said Connal's voice of wisdom. They rest together in their caves, and talk of mortal men.</P>
<P>THEN let them talk of mortal men; of every man but Erin's chief. Let me be forgot in their cave; for I will not fly from Swaran.—If I must fall, my tomb shall rise amidst the fame of future times. The hunter shall shed a tear on my stone; and sorrow dwell round the high-bosomed Bragéla. I fear not death, but I fear to fly, for Fingal saw me often victorious. Thou dim phantom of the hill, shew thyself to me! come on thy beam of heaven, and shew me my death in thine hand, yet I will not fly, thou feeble son of the wind. Go, son of Colgar, strike the shield of Caithbat, it hangs between the spears. Let my heroes rise to the sound in the midst of the battles of Erin. Though Fingal delays his coming with the race of the stormy hills; we shall fight, O Colgar's son, and die in the battle of heroes.</P>
<P>THE sound spreads wide; the heroes rise, like the breaking of a blue-rolling wave. They stood on the heath, like oaks with all

<P>HIGH Cromla's head of clouds is gray; the morning trembles on the half-enlightened ocean. The blue, gray mist swims slowly by, and hides the sons of Inis-fail.</P>
<P>RISE ye, said the king of the dark-brown shields, ye that came from Lochlin's waves. The sons of Erin have fled from our arms—pursue them over the plains of Lena.—And, Morla, go to Cormac's hall and bid them yield to Swaran; before the people shall fall into the tomb; and the hills of Ullin be silent.—They rose like a flock of sea-fowl when the waves expel them from the shore. Their sound was like a thousand streams that meet in Cona's vale, when after a stormy night, they turn their dark eddies beneath the pale light of the morning.</P>
<P>As the dark shades of autumn fly over the hills of grass; so gloo∣my, dark, successive came the chiefs of Lochlin's ecchoing woods. Tall as the stag of Morven moved on the king of groves. His shin∣ing shield is on his side like a flame on the heath at night. When the world is silent and dark, and the traveller sees some ghost sport∣ing in the beam.</P>
<P>A BLAST from the trouble of ocean removed the settled mist. The sons of Inisfail appear like a ridge of rocks on the shore.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="55"/>
Go, Morla, go, said Lochlin's king, and offer peace to these. Offer the terms we give to kings when nations bow before us. When the valiant are dead in war, and the virgins weeping on the field.</P>
<P>GREAT Morla came, the son of Swart, and stately strode the king of shields. He spoke to Erin's blue-eyed son, among the lesser heroes.</P>
<P>TAKE Swaran's peace, the warrior spoke, the peace he gives to kings when the nations bow before him. Leave Ullin's lovely plains to us, and give thy spouse and dog. Thy spouse high-bosom'd, heav∣ing fair. Thy dog that overtakes the wind. Give these to prove the weakness of thine arm, and live beneath our power.</P>
<P>TELL Swaran, tell that heart of pride, that Cuchullin never yields.—I give him the dark-blue rolling of ocean, or I give his people graves in Erin. But never shall a stranger have the lovely sun-beam of Dunscaich; or ever deer fly on Lochlin's hills before the nimble-footed Luäth.</P>
<P>VAIN ruler of the car, said Morla, wilt thou fight the king; that king whose ships of many groves could carry off thine Isle? So little is thy green-hilled Ullin to the king of stormy waves.</P>
<P>IN words I yield to many, Morla; but this sword shall yield to none. Erin shall own the sway of Cormac, while Connal and Cu∣chullin live. O Connal, first of mighty men, thou hast heard the words of Morla; shall thy thoughts then be of peace, thou breaker of the shields? Spirit of fallen Crugal! why didst thou threaten us with death?

He raises the voice of the song, and pours his soul into the minds of heroes.</P>
<P>WHERE, said the mouth of the song, where is the fallen Crugal? He lies forgot on earth, and the hall of shells<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The ancient Scot, at well as the pre∣sent highlanders, drunk in shells; hence it is that we so often meet, in the old poetry, with <HI>the chief of shells,</HI> and <HI>the halls of shells.</HI></NOTE> is silent.—Sad is the spouse of Crugal, for she is a stranger<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Crugal had married Degrena but a little time before the battle, consequently she may with propriety be called a stranger in the hall of her sorrow.</NOTE> in the hall of her sorrow. But who is she, that, like a sun-beam, flies before the ranks of the foe? It is Degrena<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Deo-ghréna signifies <HI>a sun-beam.</HI></NOTE>, lovely fair, the spouse of fallen Crugal. Her hair is on the wind behind. Her eye is red; her voice is shrill. Green, empty is thy Crugal now, his form is in the cave of the hill. He comes to the ear of rest, and raises his feeble voice; like the humming of the mountain-bee, or collected flies of evening. But Degrena falls like a cloud of the morn; the sword of Lochlin is in her side. Cairbar, she is fallen, the rising thought of thy youth. She is fallen, O Cairbar, the thought of thy youthful hours.</P>
<P>FIERCE Cairbar heard the mournful sound, and rushed on like ocean's whale; he saw the death of his daughter; and roared in the

midst of thousands<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L><HI>Mediisque in millibus ardet.</HI></L><BIBL>VIRG.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>. His spear met a son of Lochlin, and battle spread from wing to wing. As a hundred winds in Lochlin's groves, as fire in the firs of a hundred hills; so loud, so ruinous and vast the ranks of men are hewn down.—Cuchullin cut off heroes like thistles, and Swaran wasted Erin. Curach fell by his hand, and Cair∣bar of the bossy shield. Morglan lies in lasting rest; and Ca-olt trembles as he dies. His white breast is stained with his blood; and his yellow hair stretched in the dust of his native land. He often had spread the feast where he fell; and often raised the voice of the harp: when his dogs leapt around for joy; and the youths of the chace prepared the bow.</P>
<P>STILL Swaran advanced, as a stream that bursts from the desart. The little hills are rolled in its course; and the rocks half-sunk by its side.</P>
<P>BUT Cuchullin stood before him like a hill<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Virgil and Milton have made use of a comparison similar to this; I shall lay both before the reader, and let him judge for himself which of these two great poet, have best succeeded.

<P>So Cuchullin shaded the sons of Erin, and stood in the midst of thousands. Blood rises like the fount of a rock, from panting heroes
<PB N="29" REF="58"/>
around him. But Erin falls on either wing like snow in the day of the sun.</P>
<P>O SONS of Inisfail, said Grumal, Lochlin conquers on the field. Why strive we as reeds against the wind? Fly to the hill of dark-brown hinds. He fled like the stag of Morven, and his spear is a trembling beam of light behind him. Few fled with Grumal, the chief of the little soul: they fell in the battle of heroes on Lena's ecchoing heath.</P>
<P>HIGH on his car, of many gems, the chief of Erin stood; he slew a mighty son of Lochlin, and spoke, in haste, to Connal.</P>
<P>O CONNAL, first of mortal men, thou hast taught this arm of death! Though Erin's sons have fled, shall we not fight the foe? O Carril, son of other times, carry my living friends to that bushy hill.—Here, Connal, let us stand like rocks, and save our flying friends.</P>
<P>CONNAL mounts the car of light. They stretch their shields like the darkened moon, the daughter of the starry skies, when she moves, a dun circle, through heaven. Sithfadda panted up the hill, and Stronnal haughty steed. Like waves behind a whale behind them rushed the foe.</P>
<P>Now on the rising side of Cromla stood Erin's few sad sons; like a grove through which the flame had rushed hurried on by the winds of the stormy night.—Cuchullin stood beside an oak. He rolled his red eye in silence, and heard the wind in his bushy hair; when the scout of ocean came, Moran the son of Fithil.—The ships, he cried, the ships of the lonely isle! There Fingal comes
<PB N="30" REF="59"/>
the first of men, the breaker of the shields. The waves foam be∣fore his black prows. His masts with sails are like groves in clouds.</P>
<P>BLOW, said Cuchullin, all ye winds that rush over my isle of lovely mist. Come to the death of thousands, O chief of the hills of hinds. Thy sails, my friend, are to me like the clouds of the morning; and thy ships like the light of heaven; and thou thy∣self like a pillar of fire that giveth light in the night. O Connal, first of men, how pleasant are our friends! But the night is gather∣ing around; where now are the ships of Fingal? Here let us pass the hours of darkness, and wish for the moon of heaven.</P>
<P>THE winds came down on the woods. The torrents rushed from the rocks. Rain gathered round the head of Cromla. And the red stars trembled between the flying clouds. Sad, by the side of a stream whose sound was ecchoed by a tree, sad by the side of a stream the chief of Erin sat. Connal son of Colgar was there, and Carril of other times.</P>
<P>UNHAPPY is the hand of Cuchullin, said the son of Semo, un∣happy is the hand of Cuchullin since he slew his friend.—Ferda, thou son of Damman, I loved thee as myself.</P>
<P>How, Cuchullin, son of Semo, fell the breaker of the shields? Well I remember, said Connal, the noble son of Damman. Tall and fair he was like the rain-bow of the hill.</P>
<P>FERDA from Albion came, the chief of a hundred hills. In Muri's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An academy in Ulster for teaching the use of arms.</NOTE> hall he learned the sword, and won the friendship of Cu∣chullin. We moved to the chace together; and one was our bed in the heath.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="60"/>
DEUGALA was the spouse of Cairbar, chief of the plains of Ullin. She was covered with the light of beauty, but her heart was the house of pride. She loved that sun-beam of youth, the noble son of Damman. Cairbar, said the white-armed woman, give me half of the herd. No more I will remain in your halls. Divide the herd, dark Cairbar.</P>
<P>LET Cuchullin, said Cairbar, divide my herd on the hill. His breast is the seat of justice. Depart, thou light of beauty. I went and divided the herd. One bull of snow remained. I gave that bull to Cairbar. The wrath of Deugala rose.</P>
<P>SON of Damman, begun the fair, Cuchullin pains my soul. I must hear of his death, or Lubar's stream shall roll over me. My pale ghost shall wander near thee, and mourn the wound of my pride. Pour out the blood of Cuchullin or pierce this heaving breast.</P>
<P>DEUGALA, said the fair-haired youth, how shall I slay the son of Semo? He is the friend of my secret thoughts, and shall I lift the sword? She wept three days before him, on the fourth he con∣sented to fight.</P>
<P>I WILL fight my friend, Deugala! but may I fall by his sword. Could I wander on the hill and behold the grave of Cuchullin? We fought on the hills of Muri. Our swords avoid a wound. They slide on the helmets of steel; and sound on the slippery shields. Deu∣gala was near with a smile, and said to the son of Damman, thine arm is seeble, thou sun-beam of youth. Thy years are not strong for steel.—Yield to the son of Semo. He is like the rock of Malmor.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="61"/>
THE tear is in the eye of youth. He faultering said to me, Cu∣chullin, raise thy bossy shield. Defend thee from the hand of thy friend. My soul is laden with grief: for I must slay the chief of men.</P>
<P>I SIGHED as the wind in the chink of a rock. I lifted high the edge of my steel. The sun-beam of the battle fell; the first of Cuchullin's friends.—</P>
<P>UNHAPPY is the hand of Cuchullin since the hero fell.</P>
<P>MOURNFUL is thy tale, son of the car, said Carril of other times. It sends my soul back to the ages of old, and to the days of other years.—Often have I heard of Comal who slew the friend he lov∣ed; yet victory attended his steel; and the battle was consumed in his presence.</P>
<P>COMAL was a son of Albion; the chief of an hundred hills. His deer drunk of a thousand streams. A thousand rocks replied to the voice of his dogs. His face was the mildness of youth. His hand the death of heroes. One was his love, and fair was she! the daughter of mighty Conloch. She appeared like a sun-beam among women. And her hair was like the wing of the raven. Her dogs were taught to the chace. Her bow-string sounded on the winds of the forest. Her soul was fixed on Comal. Often met their eyes of love. Their course in the chace was one, and happy were their words in secret.—But Gormal loved the maid, the dark chief of the gloomy Ardven. He watched her lone steps in the heath; the foe of unhappy Comal.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="62"/>
ONE day, tired of the chace, when the mist had concealed their friends, Comal and the daughter of Conloch met in the cave of Ro∣nan<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The unfortunate death of this Ronan is the subject of the ninth fragment of an∣cient poetry published last year: it is not the work of Ossian, though it is writ in his manner, and bears the genuine marks of antiquity.—The concise expressions of Ossian are imitated, but the thoughts are too jejune and confined to be the produc∣tion of that poet.—Many poems go under his name that have been evidently com∣posed since his time; they are very nu∣merous in Ireland, and some have come to the translator's hands. They are trivial and dull to the last degree; swelling into ridi∣culous bombast, or sinking into the lowest kind of prosaic style.</NOTE>. It was the wonted haunt of Comal. Its sides were hung with his arms. A hundred shields of thongs were there; a hundred helms of sounding steel.</P>
<P>REST here, he said, my love Galvina; thou light of the cave of Ronan. A deer appears on Mora's brow. I go; but I will soon return. I fear, she said, dark Grumal my foe; he haunts the cave of Ronan. I will rest among the arms; but soon return, my love.</P>
<P>HE went to the deer of Mora. The daughter of Conloch would try his love. She cloathed her white sides with his armour, and strode from the cave of Ronan. He thought it was his foe. His heart beat high. His colour changed, and darkness dimmed his eyes. He drew the bow. The arrow flew. Galvina fell in blood. He run with wildness in his steps and called the daughter of Con∣loch. No answer in the lonely rock. Where are thou, O my love! He saw, at length, her heaving heart beating around the arrow he threw. O Conloch's daughter, is it thou? He sunk upon her breast.</P>
<P>THE hunters found the hapless pair; he afterwards walked the hill. But many and silent were his steps round the dark dwelling of
<PB N="34" REF="63"/>
his love. The fleet of the ocean came. He fought, the strangers fled. He searched for his death over the field. But who could kill the mighty Comal! He threw away his dark-brown shield. An arrow found his manly breast. He sleeps with his loved Galvina at the noise of the sounding surge. Their green tombs are seen by the mariner, when he bounds on the waves of the north.</P>

<HEAD>FINGAL, AN ANCIENT EPIC POEM.</HEAD>
<HEAD>BOOK III<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The second night, since the opening of the poem, continues; and Cuchullin, Connal, and Carril still sit in the place described in the preceding book. The story of Agandecca is introduced here with propriety, as great use is made of it in the course of the poem, and as it, in some measure, brings about the catastrophe.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>PLEASANT are the words of the song, said Cuchullin, and lovely are the tales of other times. They are like the calm dew of the morning on the hill of roes, when the sun is faint on its side, and the lake is settled and blue in the vale. O Carril, raise again thy voice, and let me hear the song of Tura: which was sung in my halls of joy, when Fingal king of shields was there, and glowed at the deeds of his fathers.</P>
<P>FINGAL! thou man of battle, said Carril, early were thy deeds in arms. Lochlin was consumed in thy wrath, when thy youth strove with the beauty of maids. They smiled at the fair-blooming face of the hero; but death was in his hands. He was strong as
<PB N="36" REF="65"/>
the waters of Lora. His followers were like the roar of a thousand streams. They took the king of Lochlin in battle, but restored him to his ships. His big heart swelled with pride; and the death of the youth was dark in his soul.—For none ever, but Fingal, over∣came the strength of the mighty Starno<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Starno was the father of Swaran as well as Agandecca.—His fierce and cruel character is well marked in other poems concerning the times.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HE sat in the hall of his shells in Lochlin's woody land. He called the gray-haired Snivan, that often sung round the circle<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This passage most certainly alludes to the religion of Lochlin, and <HI>the stone of power</HI> here mentioned is the image of one of the deities of Scandanavia.</NOTE> of Loda: when the stone of power heard his cry, and the battle turned in the field of the valiant.</P>
<P>Go; gray-haired Snivan, Starno said, to Ardven's sea-surrounded rocks. Tell to Fingal king of the desart; he that is the fairest among his thousands, tell him I give him my daughter, the loveliest maid that ever heaved a breast of snow. Her arms are white as the foam of my waves. Her soul is generous and mild. Let him come with his bravest heroes to the daughter of the secret hall.</P>
<P>SNIVAN came to Albion's windy hills: and fair-haired Fingal went. His kindled soul flew before him as he bounded on the waves of the north.</P>
<P>WELCOME, said the dark-brown Starno, welcome, king of rocky Morven; and ye his heroes of might; sons of the lonely isle! Three days within my halls shall ye feast; and three days pursue my boars, that your fame may reach the maid that dwells in the secret hall.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="66"/>
THE king of snow<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Starno is here poetically called the king of snow, from the great quantities of snow that fall in his dominions.</NOTE> designed their death, and gave the feast of shells. Fingal, who doubted the foe, kept on his arms of steel. The sons of death were afraid, and fled from the eyes of the hero. The voice of sprightly mirth arose. The trembling harps of joy are strung. Bards sing the battle of heroes; or the heaving breast of love.—Ullin, Fingal's bard, was there; the sweet voice of the hill of Cona. He praised the daughter of the snow; and Morven's<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">All the North-west coast of Scotland probably went of old under the name of Mor∣ven, which signifies a ridge of very high hills.</NOTE> high-descended chief.—The daughter of the snow overheard, and left the hall of her secret sigh. She came in all her beauty, like the moon from the cloud of the east.—Loveliness was around her as light. Her steps were like the music of songs. She saw the youth and loved him. He was the stolen sigh of her soul. Her blue eye rolled on him in secret: and she blest the chief of Morven.</P>
<P>THE third day with all its beams, shone bright on the wood of boars. Forth moved the dark-browed Starno; and Fingal, king of shields. Half the day they spent in the chace; and the spear of Fingal was red in the blood of Gormal.</P>
<P>IT was then the daughter of Starno, with blue eyes rolling in tears, came with her voice of love and spoke to the king of Morven.</P>
<P>FINGAL, high-descended chief, trust not Starno's heart of pride. Within that wood he has placed his chiefs; beware of the wood of death. But, remember, son of the hill, remember Agan∣decca: save me from the wrath of my father, king of the windy Morven!</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="67"/>
THE youth, with unconcern, went on; his heroes by his side. The sons of death fell by his hand; and Gormal ecchoed around.</P>
<P>BEFORE the halls of Starno the sons of the chace convened. The king's dark brows were like clouds. His eyes like meteors of night. Bring hither, he cries, Agandecca to her lovely king of Morven. His hand is stained with the blood of my people; and her words have not been in vain.—</P>
<P>SHE came with the red eye of tears. She came with her loose raven locks. Her white breast heaved with sighs, like the foam of the streamy Lubar. Starno pierced her side with steel. She fell like a wreath of snow that slides from the rocks of Ronan; when the woods are still, and the eccho deepens in the vale.</P>
<P>THEN Fingal eyed his valiant chiefs, his valiant chiefs took arms. The gloom of the battle roared, and Lochlin fled or died.—Pale, in his bounding ship he closed the maid of the raven hair. Her tomb ascends on Ardven, and the sea roars round the dark dwelling of Agandecca.</P>
<P>BLESSED be her soul, said Cuchullin, and blessed be the mouth of the song.—Strong was the youth of Fingal, and strong in his arm of age. Lochlin shall fall again before the king of ecchoing Morven. Shew thy face from a cloud, O moon; light his white fails on the wave of the night. And if any strong spirit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is the only passage in the poem that has the appearance of religion.—But Cuchullin's apostrophe to this spirit is ac∣companied with a doubt; so that it is not easy to determine whether the hero meant a superior being, or the ghosts of deceased warriors, who were supposed in those times to rule the storms, and to transport them∣selves in a gust of wind from one country to another.</NOTE> of heaven

sits on that low-hung cloud; turn his dark ships from the rock, thou rider of the storm!</P>
<P>SUCH were the words of Cuchullin at the sound of the mountain-stream, when Calmar ascended the hill, the wounded son of Matha. From the field he came in his blood. He leaned on his bending spear. Feeble is the arm of battle! but strong the soul of the hero!</P>
<P>WELCOME! O son of Matha, said Connal, welcome art thou to thy friends! Why bursts that broken sigh from the breast of him that never feared before?</P>
<P>AND never, Connal, will he fear, chief of the pointed steel. My soul brightens in danger, and exults in the noise of battle. I am of the race of steel; my fathers never feared.</P>
<P>CORMAR was the first of my race. He sported through the storms of the waves. His black skiff bounded on ocean, and travel∣led on the wings of the blast. A spirit once embroiled the night. Seas swell and rocks resound. Winds drive along the clouds. The lightning flies on wings of fire. He feared and came to land: then blushed that he feared at all. He rushed again among the waves to find the son of the wind. Three youths guide the bounding bark; he stood with the sword unsheathed. When the low-hung vapour passed, he took it by the curling head, and searched its dark womb with his steel. The son of the wind forsook the air. The moon and stars returned.</P>
<P>SUCH was the boldness of my race; and Calmar is like his fa∣thers. Danger flies from the uplifted sword. They best succeed who dare.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="69"/>
BUT now, ye sons of green-vallyed Erin, retire from Lena's bloody heath. Collect the sad remnant of our friends, and join the sword of Fingal. I heard the sound of Lochlin's advancing arms; but Calmar will remain and fight. My voice shall be such, my friends, as if thousands were behind me. But, son of Semo, re∣member me. Remember Calmar's lifeless corse. After Fingal has wasted the field, place me by some stone of remembrance, that fu∣ture times may hear my fame; and the mother of Calmar rejoice over the stone of my renown.</P>
<P>No: son of Matha, said Cuchullin, I will never leave thee. My joy is in the unequal field: and my soul increases in danger. Connal, and Carril of other times, carry off the sad sons of Erin; and when the battle is over, search for our pale corses in this narrow way. For near this oak we shall stand in the stream of the battle of thousands.</P>
<P>O FITHIL'S son, with feet of wind, fly over the heath of Lena. Tell to Fingal that Erin is inthralled, and bid the king of Morven hasten. O let him come like the sun in a storm, when he shines on the hills of grass.</P>
<P>MORNING is gray on Cromla; the sons of the sea ascend. Cal∣mar stood forth to meet them in the pride of his kindling soul. But pale was the face of the warrior; he leaned on his father's spear.

sandy vale. The sea comes with its waves, and roars on its harden∣ed sides. Its head is covered with foam, and the hills are ecchoing around.—Now from the gray mist of the ocean, the white-sailed ships of Fingal appear. High is the grove of their masts as they nod, by turns, on the rolling wave.</P>
<P>SWARAN saw them from the hill, and returned from the sons of Erin. As ebbs the resounding sea through the hundred isles of Inis-tore; so loud, so vast, so immense returned the sons of Lochlin against the king of the desart hill. But bending, weeping, sad, and slow, and dragging his long spear behind, Cuchullin sunk in Crom∣la's wood, and mourned his fallen friends. He feared the face of Fingal, who was wont to greet him from the fields of renown.</P>
<P>HOW many lie there of my heroes! the chiefs of Inisfail! they that were chearful in the hall when the sound of the shells arose. No more shall I find their steps in the heath, or hear their voice in the chace of the hinds. Pale, silent, low on bloody beds are they who were my friends! O spirits of the lately-dead, meet Cuchullin on his heath. Converse with him on the wind, when the rustling tree of Tura's cave resounds. There, far remote, I shall lie un∣known. No bard shall hear of me. No gray stone shall rise to my renown. Mourn me with the dead, O Bragela! departed is my fame.</P>
<P>SUCH were the words of Cuchullin when he sunk in the woods of Cromla.</P>
<P>FINGAL, tall in his ship, stretched his bright lance before him. Terrible was the gleam of the steel: it was like the green meteor of death, setting in the heath of Malmor, when the traveller is alone, and the broad moon is darkened in heaven.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="71"/>
THE battle is over, said the king, and I behold the blood of my friends. Sad is the heath of Lena; and mournful the oaks of Cromla: the hunters have fallen there in their strength; and the son of Semo is no more.—Ryno and Fillan, my sons, sound the horn of Fingal's war. Ascend that hill on the shore, and call the children of the foe. Call them from the grave of Lamdarg, the chief of other times.</P>
<P>BE your voice like that of your father, when he enters the battles of his strength. I wait for the dark mighty man; I wait on Lena's shore for Swaran. And let him come with all his race; for strong in battle are the friends of the dead.</P>
<P>FAIR Ryno flew like lightning; dark Fillan as the shade of au∣tumn. On Lena's heath their voice is heard; the sons of ocean heard the horn of Fingal's war. As the roaring eddy of ocean re∣turning from the kingdom of snows; so strong, so dark, so sudden came down the sons of Lochlin. The king in their front appears in the dismal pride of his arms. Wrath burns in his dark-brown face: and his eyes roll in the fire of his valour.</P>
<P>FINGAL beheld the son of Starno; and he remembered Agan∣decca.—For Swaran with the tears of youth had mourned his white-bosomed sister. He sent Ullin of the songs to bid him to the feast of shells. For pleasant on Fingal's soul returned the remem∣brance of the first of his loves.</P>
<P>ULLIN came with aged steps, and spoke to Starno's son. O thou that dwellest afar, surrounded, like a rock, with thy waves, come to the feast of the king, and pass the day in rest. To morrow let us sight, O Swaran, and break the ecchoing shields.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="72"/>
TO-DAY, said Starno's wrathful son, we break the ecchoing shields: to-morrow my feast will be spread; and Fingal lie on earth.</P>
<P>AND to-morrow let his feast be spread, said Fingal with a smile; for to-day, O my sons, we shall break the ecchoing shields.—Ossian, stand thou near my arm. Gaul, lift thy terrible sword. Fergus, bend thy crooked yew. Throw, Fillan, thy lance through heaven.—Lift your shields like the darkened moon. Be your spears the meteors of death. Follow me in the path of my fame; and equal my deeds in battle.</P>
<P>AS a hundred winds on Morven; as the streams of a hundred hills; as clouds fly successive over heaven; or, as the dark ocean assaults the shore of the desart: so roaring, so vast, so terrible the armies mixed on Lena's ecchoing heath.</P>
<P>THE groan of the people spread over the hills; it was like the thunder of night, when the cloud bursts on Cona; and a thousand ghosts shriek at once on the hollow wind.</P>
<P>FINGAL rushed on in his strength, terrible as the spirit of Tren∣mor; when, in a whirlwind, he comes to Morven to see the chil∣dren of his pride—The oaks resound on their hills, and the rocks fall down before him. Bloody was the hand of my father when he whirled the lightning of his sword. He remembers the battles of his youth, and the field is wasted in his course.</P>
<P>RYNO went on like a pillar of fire.—Dark is the brow of Gaul. Fergus rushed forward with feet of wind; and Fillan like the mist

of the hill.—Myself<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here the poet celebrates his own ac∣tions, but he does it in such a manner that we are not displeased. The mention of the great actions of his youth immediately suggests to him the helpless situation of his age. We do not despise him for selfish praise, but feel his misfortunes.</NOTE>, like a rock, came down, I exulted in the strength of the king. Many were the deaths of my arm; and dismal was the gleam of my sword. My locks were not then so gray; nor trembled my hands of age. My eyes were not closed in darkness; nor failed my feet in the race.</P>
<P>WHO can relate the deaths of the people; or the deeds of mighty heroes; when Fingal, burning in his wrath, consumed the sons of Lochlin? Groans swelled on groans from hill to hill, till night had covered all. Pale, staring like a herd of deer, the sons of Lochlin convene on Lena. We sat and heard the sprightly harp at Lubar's gentle stream. Fingal himself was next to the foe; and listened to the tales of bards. His godlike race were in the song, the chiefs of other times. Attentive, leaning on his shield, the king of Morven sat. The wind whistled through his aged locks, and his thoughts are of the days of other years. Near him on his bending spear, my young, my lovely Oscar stood. He admired the king of Mor∣ven: and his actions were swelling in his soul.</P>
<P>SON of my son, begun the king, O Oscar, pride of youth, I saw the shining of thy sword and gloried in my race. Pursue the glory of our fathers, and be what they have been; when Trenmor lived, the first of men, and Trathal the father of heroes. They fought the battle in their youth, and are the song of bards.</P>
<P>O OSCAR! bend the strong in arm: but spare the feeble hand. Be thou a stream of many tides against the foes of thy people; but
<PB N="45" REF="74"/>
like the gale that moves the grass to those who ask thine aid.—So Trenmor lived; such Trathal was; and such has Fingal been. My arm was the support of the injured; and the weak rested behind the lightning of my steel.</P>
<P>OSCAR! I was young like thee, when lovely Fainasóllis came: that sun-beam! that mild light of love! the daughter of Craca's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">What the Craca here mentioned was, is not, at this distance of time, easy to de∣termine. The most probable opinion is, that it was one of the Shetland isles.—There is a story concerning a daughter of the king of Craca in the sixth book.</NOTE> king! I then returned from Cona's heath, and few were in my train. A white-sailed boat appeared far off; we saw it like a mist that rode on ocean's blast. It soon approached; we saw the fair. Her white breast heaved with sighs. The wind was in her loose dark hair: her rosy cheek had tears.</P>
<P>DAUGHTER of beauty, calm I said, what sigh is in that breast? Can I, young as I am, defend thee, daughter of the sea? My sword is not unmatched in war, but dauntless is my heart.</P>
<P>To thee I fly, with sighs she replied, O prince of mighty men! To thee I fly, chief of the generous shells, supporter of the feeble hand! The king of Craca's ecchoing isle owned me the sun-beam of his race. And often did the hills of Cromala reply to the sighs of love for the unhappy Fainasóllis. Sora's chief beheld me fair; and loved the daughter of Craca. His sword is like a beam of light upon the warrior's side. But dark is his brow; and tempests are in his soul. I shun him on the rolling sea; but Sora's chief pursues.</P>
<P>Rest thou, I said, behind my shield; rest in peace, thou beam of light! The gloomy chief of Sora will fly, if Fingal's arm is like his
<PB N="46" REF="75"/>
soul. In some lone cave I might conceal thee, daughter of the sea! But Fingal never flies; for where the danger threatens, I rejoice in the storm of spears.</P>
<P>I SAW the tears upon her cheek. I pitied Craca's fair.</P>
<P>Now, like a dreadful wave afar, appeared the ship of stormy Borbar. His masts high-bended over the sea behind their sheets of snow. White roll the waters on either side. The strength of ocean sounds. Come thou, I said, from the roar of ocean, thou rider of the storm. Partake the feast within my hall. It is the house of strangers.</P>
<P>THE maid stood trembling by my side; he drew the bow: she fell. Unerring is thy hand, I said, but feeble was the foe.</P>
<P>WE fought, nor weak was the strife of death. He sunk beneath my sword. We laid them in two tombs of stones; the hapless lo∣vers of youth.</P>
<P>SUCH have I been in my youth, O Oscar; be thou like the age of Fingal. Never search for the battle, nor shun it when it comes.</P>
<P>FILLAN and Oscar of the dark-brown hair; ye children of the race; fly over the heath of roaring winds; and view the sons of Lochlin. Far off I hear the noise of their fear, like the storms of ecchoing Cona. Go: that they may not fly my sword along the waves of the north.—For many chiefs of Erin's race lie here on the dark bed of death. The children of the storm are low; the sons of ecchoing Cromla.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="76"/>
THE heroes flew like two dark clouds: two dark clouds that are the chariots of ghosts; when air's dark children come to frighten hapless men.</P>
<P>IT was then that Gaul<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gaul, the son of Morni, was chief of a tribe that disputed long, the pre-eminence, with Fingal himself. They were reduced at last to obedience, and Gaul, from an enemy, turned Fingal's best friend and greatest hero. His character is something like that of Ajax in the Iliad; a hero of more strength than conduct in battle. He was very fond of military fame, and here he demands the next battle to himself.—The poet, by an artifice, removes Fingal, that his return may be the more magnificent.</NOTE>, the son of Morni, stood like a rock in the night. His spear is glittering to the stars; his voice like many streams.</P>
<P>SON of battle, cried the chief, O Fingal, king of shells! let the bards of many songs sooth Erin's friends to rest. And, Fingal, sheath thy sword of death; and let thy people fight. We wither away without our fame; for our king is the only breaker of shields. When morning rises on our hills, behold at a distance our deeds. Let Lochlin feel the sword of Morni's son, that bards may sing of me. Such was the custom heretofore of Fingal's noble race. Such was thine own, thou king of swords, in battles of the spear.</P>
<P>O SON of Morni, Fingal replied, I glory in thy fame.—Fight; but my spear shall be near to aid thee in the midst of danger. Raise, raise the voice, sons of the song, and lull me into rest. Here will Fingal lie amidst the wind of night.—And if thou, Agandecca, art near, among the children of thy land; if thou sittest on a blast of wind among the high-shrowded masts of Lochlin; come to my dreams<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The poet prepares us for the dream of Fingal in the next book.</NOTE>, my fair one, and shew thy bright face to my soul.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="77"/>
MANY a voice and many a harp in tuneful sounds arose. Of Fin∣gal's noble deeds they sung, and of the noble race of the hero. And sometimes on the lovely sound was heard the name of the now mournful Ossian.</P>
<P>OFTEN have I fought, and often won in battles of the spear. But blind, and tearful, and forlorn I now walk with little men. O Fin∣gal, with thy race of battle I now behold thee not. The wild roes feed upon the green tomb of the mighty king of Morven.—Blest be thy soul, thou king of swords, thou most renowned on the hills of Cona!</P>

<HEAD>FINGAL, AN ANCIENT EPIC POEM.</HEAD>
<HEAD>BOOK IV<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fingal being asleep, and the action suspended by night, the poet introduces the story of his courtship of Evirallin the daugh∣ter of Branno. The episode is necessary to clear up several passages that follow in the poem; at the same time that it na∣turally brings on the action of the book, which may be supposed to begin about the middle of the third night from the opening of the poem.—This book, as many of Ossian's other compositions, is addressed to the beautiful Malvina the daughter of Toscar. She appears to have been in love with Oscar, and to have affected the com∣pany of the father after the death of the son.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>WHO comes with her songs from the mountain, like the bow of the showery Lena? It is the maid of the voice of love. The white-armed daughter of Toscar. Often hast thou heard my song, and given the tear of beauty. Dost thou come to the battles of thy people, and to hear the actions of Oscar? When shall I cease to mourn by the streams of the ecchoing Cona? My years have passed away in battle, and my age is darkened with sorrow.</P>
<P>DAUGHTER of the hand of snow! I was not so mournful and blind; I was not so dark and forlorn when Everallin loved me.
<PB N="50" REF="79"/>
Everallin with the dark-brown hair, the white-bosomed love of Cor∣mac. A thousand heroes sought the maid, she denied her love to a thousand; the sons of the sword were despised; for graceful in her eyes was Ossian.</P>
<P>I WENT in suit of the maid to Lego's sable surge; twelve of my people were there, the sons of the streamy Morven. We came to Branno friend of strangers: Branno of the sounding mail.—From whence, he said, are the arms of steel? Not easy to win is the maid that has denied the blue-eyed sons of Erin. But blest be thou, O son of Fingal, happy is the maid that waits thee. Tho' twelve daughters of beauty were mine, thine were the choice, thou son of fame!—Then he opened the hall of the maid, the dark-haired Everallin. Joy kindled in our breasts of steel and blest the maid of Branno.</P>
<P>ABOVE us on the hill appeared the people of stately Cormac. Eight were the heroes of the chief; and the heath flamed with their arms. There Colla, Durra of the wounds, there mighty Toscar, and Tago, there Frestal the victorious stood; Dairo of the happy deeds, and Dala the battle's bulwark in the narrow way.—The sword flamed in the hand of Cormac, and graceful was the look of the hero.</P>
<P>EIGHT were the heroes of Ossian; Ullin stormy son of war; Mullo of the generous deeds; the noble, the graceful Scelacha; Oglan, and Cerdal the wrathful, and Dumariccan's brows of death. And why should Ogar be the last; so wide renowned on the hills of Ardven?</P>
<P>OGAR met Dala the strong, face to face, on the field of heroes. The battle of the chiefs was like the wind on ocean's foamy waves.
<PB N="51" REF="80"/>
The dagger is remembered by Ogar; the weapon which he loved; nine times he drowned it in Dela's side. The stormy battle turned. Three times I broke on Cormac's shield: three times he broke his spear. But, unhappy youth of love! I cut his head away.—Five times I shook it by the lock. The friends of Cormac fled.</P>
<P>WHOEVER would have told me, lovely maid, when then I strove in battle; that blind, forsaken, and forlorn I now should pass the night; firm ought his mail to have been, and unmatched his arm in battle.</P>
<P>Now<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The poet returns to his subject. If one could six the time of the year in which the action of the poem happened, from the scene described here, I should be tempted to place it in autumn—The trees shed their leaves, and the winds are variable, both which circumstances agree with that season of the year.</NOTE> on Lena's gloomy heath the voice of music died away. The unconstant blast blew hard, and the high oak shook its leaves around me; of Everallin were my thoughts, when she, in all the light of beauty, and her blue eyes rolling in tears, stood on a cloud before my sight, and spoke with feeble voice.</P>
<P>O OSSIAN, rise and save my son; save Oscar prince of men, near the red oak of Lubar's stream, he fights with Lochlin's sons.—She sunk into her cloud again. I clothed me with my steel. My spear supported my steps, and my rattling armour rung. I hummed, as I was wont in danger, the songs of heroes of old. Like distant thun∣der<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ossian gives the reader a high idea of himself. His very song frightens the ene∣my.

<P><PB N="52" REF="81"/>
I CALLED him like a distant stream. My son return over Lena. No further pursue the foe, though Ossian is behind thee.—He came; and lovely in my ear was Oscar's sounding steel. Why didst thou stop my hand, he said, till death had covered all? For dark and dreadful by the stream they met thy son and Fillan. They watched the terrors of the night. Our swords have conquered some. But as the winds of night pour the ocean over the white sands of Mora, so dark advance the sons of Lochlin over Lena's rustling heath. The ghosts of night shriek afar; and I have seen the meteors of death. Let me awake the king of Morven, he that smiles in danger; for he is like the sun of heaven that rises in a storm.</P>
<P>FINGAL had strated from a dream, and leaned on Trenmor's shield; the dark-brown shield of his fathers; which they had lifted of old in the battles of their race.</P>
<P>MY hero had seen in his rest the mournful form of Agandecca; she came from the way of the ocean, and slowly, lonely, moved over Lena. Her face was pale like the mist of Cromla; and dark were the tears of her cheek. She often raised her dim hand from her robe; her robe which was of the clouds of the desart: she raised her dim hand over Fingal, and turned away her silent eyes.</P>
<P>WHY weeps the daughter of Starno, said Fingal, with a sigh? Why is thy face so pale, thou daughter of the clouds?</P>
<P>SHE departed on the wind of Lena; and left him in the midst of the night.—She mourned the sons of her people that were to fall by Fingal's hand.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="82"/>
THE hero started from rest, and still beheld her in his soul.—The sound of Oscar's steps approached. The king saw the gray shield on his side. For the faint beam of the morning came over the waters of Ullin.</P>
<P>WHAT do the foes in their fear, said the rising king of Morven? Or fly they through ocean's foam, or wait they the battle of steel? But why should Fingal ask? I hear their voice on the early wind.—Fly over Lena's heath, O Oscar, and awake our friends to battle.</P>
<P>THE king stood by the stone of Lubar; and thrice reared his ter∣rible voice. The deer started from the fountains of Cromla; and all the rocks shook on their hills. Like the noise of a hundred mountain-streams, that burst, and roar, and foam: like the clouds that gather to a tempest on the blue face of the sky; so met the sons of the desart, round the terrible voice of Fingal. For pleasant was the voice of the king of Morven to the warriors of his land: for often had he led them to battle, and returned with the spoils of the foe.</P>
<P>COME to battle, said the king, ye children of the storm. Come to the death of thousands. Comhal's son will see the fight.—My sword shall wave on that hill, and be the shield of my people. But never may you need it, warriors; while the son of Morni fights, the chief of mighty men.—He shall lead my battle; that his fame may rise in the song.</P>
<P>O YE ghosts of heroes dead! ye riders of the storm of Cromla! receive my falling people with joy, and bring them to your hills.—And may the blast of Lena carry them over my seas, that they may come to my silent dreams, and delight my soul in rest.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="83"/>
FILLAN and Oscar, of the dark-brown hair! fair Ryno, with the pointed steel! advance with valour to the fight; and behold the son of Morni. Let your swords be like his in the strife: and behold the deeds of his hands. Protect the friends of your father: and remember the chiefs of old. My children, I will see you yet, though here ye should fall in Erin. Soon shall our cold, pale ghosts meet in a cloud, and fly over the hills of Cona.</P>
<P>NOW like a dark and stormy cloud, edged round with the red lightning of heaven, and flying westward from the morning's beam, the king of hills removed. Terrible is the light of his armour, and two spears are in his hand.—His gray hair falls on the wind.—He often looks back on the war. Three bards attend the son of fame, to carry his words to the heroes.—High on Cromla's side he sat, waving the lightning of his sword, and as he waved we moved.</P>
<P>JOY rose in Oscar's face. His cheek is red. His eye sheds tears. The sword is a beam of fire in his hand. He came, and smiling, spoke to Ossian.</P>
<P>O RULER of the fight of steel! my father, hear thy son. Retire with Morven's mighty chief; and give me Ossian's fame. And if here I fall; my king, remember that breast of snow, that lonely sun-beam of my love, the white-handed daughter of Toscar. For with red cheek from the rock, and bending over the stream, her soft hair flies about her bosom as she pours the sigh for Oscar. Tell her I am on my hills a lightly-bounding son of the wind; that hereafter, in a cloud, I may meet the lovely maid of Toscar.</P>
<P>RAISE, Oscar, rather raise my tomb. I will not yield the fight to thee. For first and bloodiest in the war my arm shall teach
<PB N="55" REF="84"/>
thee how to fight. But, remember, my son, to place this sword, this bow, and the horn of my deer, within that dark and narrow house, whose mark is one gray stone. Oscar, I have no love to leave to the care of my son; for graceful Evirallin is no more, the lovely daughter of Branno.</P>
<P>SUCH were our words, when Gaul's loud voice came growing on the wind. He waved on high the sword of his father, and rushed to death and wounds.</P>
<P>AS waves white-bubbling over the deep come swelling, roaring on; as rocks of ooze meet roaring waves: so foes attacked and fought. Man met with man, and steel with steel. Shields sound, men fall. As a hundred hammers on the son of the furnace, so rose, so rung their swords.</P>
<P>GAUL rushed on like a whirlwind in Ardven. The destruction of heroes is on his sword. Swaran was like the fire of the desart in the ecchoing heath of Gormal. How can I give to the song the death of many spears? My sword rose high, and flamed in the strife of blood. And, Oscar, terrible wert thou, my best, my greatest son! I rejoiced in my secret soul, when his sword flamed over the slain. They fled amain through Lena's heath: and we pursued and slew. As stones that bound from rock to rock; as axes in ecchoing woods; as thunder rolls from hill to hill in dismal broken peals; so blow succeeded to blow, and death to death, from the hand of Oscar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ossian never fails to give a fine cha∣racter of his beloved son. His speech to his father is that of a hero; it contains the submission due to a parent, and the warmth that becomes a young warrior. There is a propriety in dwelling here on the actions of Oscar, as the beautiful Malvina, to whom the book is addressed, was in love with that hero.</NOTE> and mine.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="85"/>
BUT Swaran closed round Morni's son, as the strength of the tide of Inistore. The king half-rose from his hill at the sight, and half-assumed the spear. Go, Ullin, go, my aged bard, begun the king of Morven. Remind the mighty Gaul of battle; remind him of his fathers. Support the yielding fight with song; for song enlivens war. Tall Ullin went, with steps of age, and spoke to the king of swords.</P>
<P>SON<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The war-song of Ullin varies from the rest of the poem in the versification. It runs down like a torrent; and consists almost intirely of epithets. The custom of en∣couraging men in battle with extempore rhymes, has been carried down almost to our own times. Several of these war-songs are extant, but the most of them are only a group of epithets, without beauty or har∣mony, utterly destitute of poetical merit.</NOTE> of the chief of generous steeds! high-bounding king of spears. Strong arm in every perilous toil. Hard heart that never yields. Chief of the pointed arms of death. Cut down the foe; let no white sail bound round dark Inistore. Be thine arm like thunder. Thine eyes like fire, thy heart of solid rock. Whirl round thy sword as a meteor at night, and lift thy shield like the flame of death. Son of the chief of generous steeds, cut down the foe; destroy.—The hero's heart beat high. But Swaran came with battle. He cleft the shield of Gaul in twain; and the sons of the desart fled.</P>
<P>NOW Fingal arose in his might, and thrice he reared his voice. Cromla answered around, and the sons of the desart stood still.—They bent their red faces to earth, ashamed at the presence of Fin∣gal. He came like a cloud of rain in the days of the sun, when slow it rolls on the hill, and fields expect the shower. Swaran be∣held the terrible king of Morven, and stopped in the midst of his course. Dark he leaned on his spear, rolling his red eyes around. Silent and tall he seemed as an oak on the banks of Lubar, which
<PB N="57" REF="86"/>
had its branches blasted of old by the lightning of heaven.—It bends over the stream, and the gray moss whistles in the wind: so stood the king. Then slowly he retired to the rising heath of Lena. His thousands pour around the hero, and the darkness of battle ga∣thers on the hill.</P>
<P>FINGAL, like a beam from heaven, shone in the midst of his people. His heroes gather around him, and he sends forth the voice of his power. Raise my standards<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Th' imperial ensign, which full high advanc'd,</L>

O Oscar, of the future fights; Connal, son of the blue blades of Sora; Dermid of the dark-brown hair, and Ossian king of many songs, be near your father's arm.</P>
<P>WE reared the sun-beam<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Fingal's standard was distinguished by the name of <HI>sun-beam;</HI> probably on account of its bright colour, and its being studded with gold.

Each hero's soul exulted with joy, as, waving, it flew on the wind. It was studded with gold above, as the blue wide shell of the nightly sky. Each hero had his standard too; and each his gloomy men.</P>
<P>BEHOLD, said the king of generous shells, how Lochlin divides on Lena.—They stand like broken clouds on the hill, or an half consumed grove of oaks; when we see the sky through its branches, and the meteor passing behind. Let every chief among the friends
<PB N="58" REF="87"/>

<P>MINE, said Gaul, be the seven chiefs that came from Lano's lake.—Let Inistore's dark king, said Oscar, come to the sword of Ossian's son.—To mine the king of Iniscon, said Connal, heart of steel! Or Mudan's chief or I, said brown-haired Dermid, shall sleep on clay-cold earth. My choice, though now so weak and dark, was Terman's battling king; I promised with my hand to win the hero's dark-brown shield.—Blest and victorious be my chiefs, said Fingal of the mildest look; Swaran, king of roaring waves, thou art the choice of Fingal.</P>
<P>NOW, like an hundred different winds that pour through many vales; divided, dark the sons of the hill advanced, and Cromla ec∣choed around.</P>
<P>HOW can I relate the deaths when we closed in the strife of our steel? O daughter of Toscar! bloody were our hands!

<BIBL>DRYDEN.</BIBL></Q></NOTE> comes roaring down the hills. Such was the noise of battle, maid of the arms of snow. Why, daughter of the hill, that tear? the maids of Lochlin have cause to weep. The people of their country fell, for bloody were the blue blades of the race of my heroes. But I am sad, forlorn, and blind; and no more the companion of heroes. Give, lovely maid, to me thy tears, for I have seen the tombs of all my friends.</P>
<P>IT was then by Fingal's hand a hero fell, to his grief.—Gray-haired he rolled in the dust, and lifted his faint eyes to the king. And is it by me thou hast fallen, said the son of Comhal, thou friend of Agandecca! I have seen thy tears for the maid of my love in the halls of the bloody Starno. Thou hast been the foe of the foes of my love, and hast thou fallen by my hand? Raise, Ullin, raise the grave of the son of Mathon; and give his name to the song of Agandecca; for dear to my soul hast thou been, thou darkly-dwelling maid of Ardven.</P>
<P>CUCHULLIN, from the cave of Cromla, heard the noise of the troubled war. He called to Connal chief of swords, and Carril of other times. The gray-haired heroes heard his voice, and took their aspen spears.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="89"/>
THEY came, and saw the tide of battle, like the crowded waves of the ocean; when the dark wind blows from the deep, and rolls the billows through the sandy vale.</P>
<P>CUCHULLIN kindled at the sight, and darkness gathered on his brow. His hand is on the sword of his fathers: his red-rolling eyes on the foe. He thrice attempted to rush to battle, and thrice did Connal stop him. Chief of the isle of mist, he said, Fingal subdues the foe. Seek not a part of the fame of the king; himself is like the storm.</P>
<P>THEN, Carril, go, replied the chief, and greet the king of Mor∣ven. When Lochlin falls away like a stream after rain, and the noise of the battle is over. Then be thy voice sweet in his ear to praise the king of swords. Give him the sword of Caithbat, for Cuchullin is worthy no more to lift the arms of his fathers.</P>
<P>BUT, O ye ghosts of the lonely Cromla! ye souls of chiefs that are no more! be ye the companions of Cuchullin, and talk to him in the cave of his sorrow. For never more shall I be renowned among the mighty in the land. I am like a beam that has shone, like a mist that fled away; when the blast of the morning came, and brightened the shaggy side of the hill. Connal! talk of arms no more: departed is my fame.—My sighs shall be on Cromla's wind; till my footsteps cease to be seen.—And thou, white-bosom'd Bragela, mourn over the fall of my fame; for, vanquished, I will never re∣turn to thee, thou sun-beam of Dunscaich.</P>

<HEAD>FINGAL, AN ANCIENT EPIC POEM.</HEAD>
<HEAD>BOOK V<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The fourth day still continues. The poet by putting the narration in the mouth of Connal, who still remained with Cu∣chullin on the side of Cromla, gives pro∣priety to the praises of Fingal. The be∣ginning of this book, in the original, is one of the most beautiful parts of the poem. The versification is regular and full, and agrees very well with the sedate character of Connal.—No poet has ad∣apted the cadence of his verse more to the temper of the speaker, than Ossian has done. It is more than probable that the whole poem was originally designed to be sung to the harp, as the versification is so various, and so much suited to the different passions of the human mind.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>NOW Connal, on Cromla's windy side, spoke to the chief of the noble car. Why that gloom, son of Semo? Our friends are the mighty in battle. And renowned art thou, O warrior! many were the deaths of thy steel. Often has Bragela met with blue-rolling eyes of joy; often has she met her hero, returning in the midst of the valiant; when his sword was red with slaughter, and his foes silent in the fields of the tomb. Pleasant to her ears were thy bards, when thine actions rose in the song.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="91"/>
BUT behold the king of Morven; he moves below like a pillar of fire. His strength is like the stream of Lubar, or the wind of the ecchoing Cromla; when the branchy forests of night are overturned.</P>
<P>HAPPY are thy people, O Fingal, thine arm shall fight their battles: thou art the first in their dangers; the wisest in the days of their peace. Thou speakest and thy thousands obey; and armies tremble at the sound of thy steel. Happy are thy people, Fingal, chief of the lonely hills.</P>
<P>WHO is that so dark and terrible coming in the thunder of his course? who is it but Starno's son to meet the king of Morven? Be∣hold the battle of the chiefs: it is like the storm of the ocean, when two spirits meet far distant, and contend for the rolling of the wave. The hunter hears the noise on his hill; and sees the high billows advancing to Ardven's shore.</P>
<P>SUCH were the words of Connal, when the heroes met in the midst of their falling people. There was the clang of arms! there every blow, like the hundred hammers of the furnace! Terrible is the battle of the kings, and horrid the look of their eyes. Their dark-brown shields are cleft in twain; and their steel flies, broken, from their helmets.

limbs below. But when the pride of their strength arose, they shook the hill with their heels; rocks tumble from their places on high; the green-headed bushes are overturned. At length the strength of Swaran fell; and the king of the groves is bound.</P>
<P>THUS have I been on Cona; but Cona I behold no more, thus have I seen two dark hills removed from their place by the strength of the bursting stream. They turn from side to side, and their tall oaks meet one another on high. Then they fall together with all their rocks and trees. The streams are turned by their sides, and the red ruin is seen afar.</P>
<P>SONS of the king of Morven, said the noble Fingal, guard the king of Lochlin; for he is strong as his thousand waves. His hand is taught to the battle, and his race of the times of old. Gaul, thou first of my heroes, and Ossian king of songs, attend the friend of Agandecca, and raise to joy his grief.—But, Oscar, Fillan, and Ryno, ye children of the race! pursue the rest of Lochlin over the heath of Lena; that no vessel may hereafter bound on the dark-rolling waves of Inistore.</P>
<P>THEY flew like lightning over the heath. He slowly moved as a cloud of thunder when the sultry plain of summer is silent. His sword is before him as a sun-beam, terrible as the streaming meteor of night. He came toward a chief of Lochlin, and spoke to the son of the wave.</P>
<P>WHO is that like a cloud at the rock of the roaring stream? He cannot bound over its course; yet stately is the chief! his bossy shield is on his side; and his spear like the tree of the desart. Youth of the dark-brown hair, art thou of Fingal's foes?</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="93"/>
I AM a son of Lochlin, he cries, and strong is my arm in war. My spouse is weeping at home, but Orla<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The story of Orla is so beautiful and affecting in the original, that many are in possession of it in the north of Scotland, who never heand a syllable more of the poem. It varies the action, and awakes the attention of the reader when he expected nothing but languor in the conduct of the poem, as the great action was over in the conquest of Swaran.</NOTE> will never return.</P>
<P>OR fights or yields the hero, said Fingal of the noble deeds? foes do not conquer in my presence; but my friends are renowned in the hall. Son of the wave, follow me, partake the feast of my shells, and pursue the deer of my desart.</P>
<P>NO: said the hero, I assist the feeble: my strength shall remain with the weak in arms. My sword has been always unmatched, O warrior: let the king of Morven yield.</P>
<P>I NEVER yielded, Orla, Fingal never yielded to man. Draw thy sword and chuse thy foe. Many are my heroes.</P>
<P>AND does the king refuse the combat, said Orla of the dark-brown hair? Fingal is a match for Orla: and he alone of all his race.</P>
<P>BUT, king of Morven, if I shall fall; as one time the warrior must die; raise my tomb in the midst, and let it be the greatest on Lena. And send, over the dark-blue wave, the sword of Orla to the spouse of his love; that she may shew it to her son, with tears, to kindle his soul to war.</P>
<P>SON of the mournful tale, said Fingal, why dost thou awaken my tears? One day the warriors must die, and the children see their
<PB N="65" REF="94"/>
useless arms in the hall. But, Orla, thy tomb shall rise, and thy white-bosomed spouse weep over thy sword.</P>
<P>THEY fought on the heath of Lena, but feeble was the arm of Orla. The sword of Fingal descended, and cleft his shield in twain. It fell and glittered on the ground, as the moon on the stream of night.</P>
<P>KING of Morven, said the hero, lift thy sword, and pierce my breast. Wounded and faint from battle my friends have left me here. The mournful tale shall come to my love on the banks of the streamy Loda; when she is alone in the wood; and the rustling blast in the leaves.</P>
<P>NO; said the king of Morven, I will never wound thee, Orla. On the banks of Loda let her see thee escaped from the hands of war. Let thy gray-haired father, who, perhaps, is blind with age, hear the sound of thy voice in his hall.—With joy let the hero rise, and search for his son with his hands.</P>
<P>BUT never will he find him, Fingal; said the youth of the streamy Loda.—On Lena's heath I shall die; and foreign bards will talk of me. My broad belt covers my wound of death. And now I give it to the wind.</P>
<P>THE dark blood poured from his side, he fell pale on the heath of Lena. Fingal bends over him as he dies, and calls his younger heroes.</P>
<P>OSCAR and Fillan, my sons, raise high the memory of Orla. Here let the dark-haired hero rest far from the spouse of his love. Here let him rest in his narrow house far from the sound of Loda.
<PB N="66" REF="95"/>
The sons of the feeble will find his bow at home, but will not be able to bend it. His faithful dogs howl on his hills, and his boars, which he used to pursue, rejoice. Fallen is the arm of battle; the mighty among the valiant is low!</P>
<P>EXALT the voice, and blow the horn, ye sons of the king of Morven: let us go back to Swaran, and send the night away on song. Fillan, Oscar, and Ryno, fly over the heath of Lena. Where, Ryno, art thou, young son of fame? Thou art not wont to be the last to answer thy father.</P>
<P>RYNO, said Ullin first of bards, is with the awful forms of his fathers. With Trathal king of shields, and Trenmor of the mighty deeds. The youth is low,—the youth is pale,—he lies on Le∣na's heath.</P>
<P>AND fell the swiftest in the race, said the king, the first to bend the bow? Thou scarce hast been known to me; why did young Ryno fall? But sleep thou softly on Lena, Fingal shall soon behold thee. Soon shall my voice be heard no more, and my footsteps cease to be seen. The bards will tell of Fingal's name; the stones will talk of me. But, Ryno, thou art low indeed,—thou hast not received thy fame. Ullin, strike the harp for Ryno; tell what the chief would have been. Farewel, thou first in every field. No more shall I direct thy dart. Thou that hast been so fair; I behold thee not—Farewel.</P>
<P>THE tear is on the cheek of the king, for terrible was his son in war. His son! that was like a beam of fire by night on the hill; when the forests sink down in its course, and the traveller trembles at the sound.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="96"/>
WHOSE fame is in that dark-green tomb, begun the king of ge∣nerous shells? four stones with their heads of moss stand there; and mark the narrow house of death. Near it let my Ryno rest, and be the neighbour of the valiant. Perhaps some chief of fame is here to fly with my son on clouds. O Ullin, raise the songs of other times. Bring to memory the dark dwellers of the tomb. If in the field of the valiant they never fled from danger, my son shall rest with them, far from his friends, on the heath of Lena.</P>
<P>HERE, said the mouth of the song, here rest the first of heroes.

And who, soft smiling from her cloud, shews me her face of love? Why, daughter, why so pale art thou, first of the maids of Cromla? Dost thou sleep with the foes in battle, Gelchossa, white-bosomed daughter of Tuathal?—Thou hast been the love of thousands, but Lamderg was thy love. He came to Selma's mossy towers, and, striking his dark buckler, spoke:</P>
<P>WHERE is Gelchossa, my love, the daughter of the noble Tua∣thal? I left her in the hall of Selma, when I fought with the gloomy Ulfadda.

<P>LAMDERG! says Ferchios the son of Aidon, Gelchossa may be on Cromla; she and the maids of the bow pursuing the flying deer.</P>
<P>FERCHIOS! replied the chief of Cromla, no noise meets the ear of Lamderg. No sound is in the woods of Lena. No deer fly in my sight. No panting dog pursues. I see not Gelchossa my love, sair as the full moon setting on the hills of Cromla. Go, Ferchios, go to Allad<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Allad is plainly a druid: he is called the son of the rock, from his dwelling in a cave; and the circle of stones here men∣tioned is the pale of the druidical temple.

His dwelling is in the circle of stones. He may know of Gelchossa.</P>
<P>THE son of Aidon went; and spoke to the ear of age. Allad! thou that dwellest in the rock: thou that tremblest alone, what saw thine eyes of age?</P>
<P>I SAW, answered Allad the old, Ullin the son of Cairbar. He came like a cloud from Cromla; and he hummed a surly song like a blast in a leafless wood. He entered the hall of Selma.—Lam∣derg, he said, most dreadful of men, fight or yield to Ullin. Lam∣derg, replied Gelchossa, the son of battle, is not here. He fights Ulfada mighty chief. He is not here, thou first of men. But Lam∣derg never yielded. He will fight the son of Cairbar.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="98"/>
LOVELY art thou, said terrible Ullin, daughter of the generous Tuathal. I carry thee to Cairbar's halls. The valiant shall have Gelchossa. Three days I remain on Cromla, to wait that son of battle, Lamderg. On the fourth Gelchossa is mine, if the mighty Lamderg flies.</P>
<P>ALLAD! said the chief of Cromla, peace to thy dreams in the cave. Ferchios, sound the horn of Lamderg that Ullin may hear on Cromla. Lamderg<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The reader will find this passage al∣tered from what it was in the fragments of ancient poetry.—It is delivered down very differently by tradition, and the translator has chosen that reading which savours least of bombast.</NOTE>, like a roaring storm, ascended the hill from Selma. He hummed a surly song as he went, like the noise of a falling stream. He stood like a cloud on the hill, that varies its form to the wind. He rolled a stone, the sign of war. Ullin heard in Cairbar's hall. The hero heard, with joy, his foe, and took his father's spear. A smile brightens his dark-brown cheek, as he places his sword by his side. The dagger glittered in his hand. He whistled as he went.</P>
<P>GELCHOSSA saw the silent chief, as a wreath of mist ascending the hill.—She struck her white and heaving breast; and silent, tearful, feared for Lamderg.</P>
<P>CAIRBAR, hoary chief of shells, said the maid of the tender hand; I must bend the bow on Cromla; for I see the dark-brown hinds.</P>
<P>SHE hasted up the hill. In vain! the gloomy heroes fought.—Why should I tell the king of Morven how wrathful heroes fight!
<PB N="70" REF="99"/>
—Fierce Ullin fell. Young Lamderg came all pale to the daugh∣ter of generous Tuathal.</P>
<P>WHAT blood, my love, the soft-haired woman said, what blood runs down my warrior's side?—It is Ullin's blood, the chief re∣plied, thou fairer than the snow of Cromla! Gelchossa, let me rest here a little while. The mighty Lamderg died.</P>
<P>AND sleepest thou so soon on earth, O chief of shady Cromla? three days she mourned beside her love.—The hunters found her dead. They raised this tomb above the three. Thy son, O king of Morven, may rest here with heroes.</P>

<P>SUCH was thy grief, thou king of hills, when Ryno lay on earth. What must the grief of Ossian be, for thou thyself art gone. I hear not thy distant voice on Cona. My eyes perceive thee not. Often forlorn and dark I sit at thy tomb; and feel it with my hands. When I think I hear thy voice; it is but the blast of the desart.—Fingal has long since fallen asleep, the ruler of the war.</P>
<P>THEN Gaul and Ossian sat with Swaran on the soft green banks of Lubar. I touched the harp to please the king. But gloomy was his brow. He rolled his red eyes towards Lena. The hero mourned his people.</P>
<P>I LIFTED my eyes to Cromla, and I saw the son of generous Se∣mo.—Sad and slow he retired from his hill towards the lonely cave of Tura. He saw Fingal victorious, and mixed his joy with grief. The sun is bright on his armour, and Connal slowly fol∣lowed. They sunk behind the hill like two pillars of the fire of night: when winds pursue them over the mountain, and the flaming heath resounds. Beside a stream of roaring foam his cave is in a rock. One tree bends above it; and the rushing winds eccho against its sides. Here rests the chief of Dunscaich, the son of generous Semo. His thoughts are on the battles he lost; and the tear is on his cheek. He mourned the departure of his fame that fled like the mist of Cona. O Bragela, thou art too far remote to cheer the soul of the hero. But let him see thy bright form in his soul; that his thoughts may return to the lonely sun-beam of Dunscaich.</P>

WHO comes with the locks of age? It is the son of the songs. Hail, Carril of other times, thy voice is like the harp in the halls of Tura. Thy words are pleasant as the shower that falls on the fields of the sun. Carril of the times of old, why comest thou from the son of the generous Semo?</P>
<P>OSSIAN king of swords, replied the bard, thou best raisest the song. Long hast thou been known to Carril, thou ruler of battles. Often have I touched the harp to lovely Evirallin. Thou too hast often accompanied my voice in Branno's hall of generous shells. And often, amidst our voices, was heard the mildest Evirallin. One day she sung of Cormac's fall, the youth that died for her love. I saw the tears on her cheek, and on thine, thou chief of men. Her soul was touched for the unhappy, though she loved him not. How fair among a thousand maids was the daughter of the generous Branno!</P>
<P>BRING not, Carril, I replied, bring not her memory to my mind. My soul must melt at the remembrance. My eyes must have their tears. Pale in the earth is she the softly-blushing fair of my love.</P>

<HEAD>BOOK VI<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This book opens with the fourth night, and ends on the morning of the sixth day. The time of five days, five nights, and a part of the sixth day is taken up in the poem. The scene lies in the heath of Lena, and the mountain Cromla on the coast of Ulster.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>THE clouds of night came rolling down and rest on Cromla's dark-brown steep. The stars of the north arise over the rol∣ling of the waves of Ullin; they shew their heads of fire through the flying mist of heaven. A distant wind roars in the wood; but silent and dark is the plain of death.</P>
<P>STILL on the darkening Lena arose in my ears the tuneful voice of Carril. He sung of the companions of our youth, and the days of former years; when we met on the banks of Lego, and sent round the joy of the shell. Cromla, with its cloudy steeps, answered to his voice. The ghosts of those he sung came in their rustling blasts. They were seen to bend with joy towards the sound of their praise.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="103"/>
BE thy soul blest, O Carril, in the midst of thy eddying winds. O that thou wouldst come to my hall when I am alone by night!—And thou dost come, my friend, I hear often thy light hand on my harp; when it hangs on the distant wall, and the feeble sound touches my ear. Why dost thou not speak to me in my grief, and tell when I shall behold my friends? But thou passest away in thy murmuring blast; and thy wind whistles through the gray hair of Ossian.</P>
<P>NOW on the side of Mora the heroes gathered to the feast. A thousand aged oaks are burning to the wind.—The strength<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By the strength of the shell is meant the liquor the heroes drunk: of what kind it was, cannot be ascertained at this distance of time.

The names of both are borrowed from the Latin, which plainly shews that our ancestors had them from the Romans, if they had them at all. The Caledonians in their frequent incursions to the province might become acquainted with those con∣veniencies of life, and introduce them into their own country, among the booty which they carried from South Britain.</NOTE> of the shells goes round. And the souls of warriors brighten with joy. But the king of Lochlin is silent, and sorrow reddens in the eyes of his pride. He often turned toward Lena and remembered that he fell.</P>
<P>FINGAL leaned on the shield of his fathers. His gray locks slowly waved on the wind, and glittered to the beam of night. He saw the grief of Swaran, and spoke to the first of Bards.</P>
<P>RAISE, Ullin, raise the song of peace, and sooth my soul after battle, that my ear may forget the noise of arms. And let a hun∣dred harps be near to gladden the king of Lochlin. He must depart from us with joy.—None ever went sad from Fingal. Oscar! the

<P>TRENMOR<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Trenmor was great grandfather to Fingal. The story is introduced to facilitate the dismission of Swaran.</NOTE>, said the mouth of the songs, lived in the days of other years. He bounded over the waves of the north: companion of the storm. The high rocks of the land of Lochlin, and its groves of murmuring sounds appeared to the hero through the mist;—he bound his white-bosomed sails.—Trenmor pursued the boar that roared along the woods of Gormal. Many had fled from its pre∣sence; but the spear of Trenmor slew it.</P>
<P>THREE chiefs that beheld the deed, told of the mighty stranger. They told that he stood like a pillar of fire in the bright arms of his valour. The king of Lochlin prepared the feast, and called the blooming Trenmor. Three days he feasted at Gormal's windy towers; and got his choice in the combat.</P>
<P>THE land of Lochlin had no hero that yielded not to Trenmor. The shell of joy went round with songs in praise of the king of Morven; he that came over the waves, the first of mighty men.</P>
<P>NOW when the fourth gray morn arose, the hero launched his ship; and walking along the silent shore waited for the rushing wind. For loud and distant he heard the blast murmuring in the grove.</P>
<P>COVERED over with arms of steel a son of the woody Gormal appeared. Red was his cheek and fair his hair. His skin like the snow of Morven. Mild rolled his blue and smiling eye when he spoke to the king of swords.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="105"/>
STAY, Trenmor, stay thou first of men, thou hast not conquered Lonval's son. My sword has often met the brave. And the wise shun the strength of my bow.</P>
<P>THOU fair-haired youth, Trenmor replied, I will not fight with Lonval's son. Thine arm is feeble, sun-beam of beauty. Retire to Gormal's dark-brown hinds.</P>
<P>BUT I will retire, replied the youth, with the sword of Tren∣mor; and exult in the sound of my fame. The virgins shall gather with smiles around him who conquered Trenmor. They shall sigh with the sighs of love, and admire the length of thy spear; when I shall carry it among thousands, and lift the glittering point to the sun.</P>
<P>THOU shalt never carry my spear, said the angry king of Mor∣ven.—Thy mother shall find thee pale on the shore of the eccho∣ing Gormal; and, looking over the dark-blue deep, see the fails of him that slew her son.</P>
<P>I WILL not lift the spear, replied the youth, my arm is not strong with years. But with the feathered dart, I have learned to pierce a distant foe. Throw down that heavy mail of steel; for Trenmor is covered all over.—I first, will lay my mail on earth.—Throw now thy dart, thou king of Morven.</P>
<P>HE saw the heaving of her breast. It was the sister of the king.—She had seen him in the halls of Gormal; and loved his face of youth.—The spear dropt from the hand of Trenmor: he bent his red cheek to the ground, for he had seen her like a beam of light
<PB N="77" REF="106"/>
that meets the sons of the cave, when they revisit the fields of the sun, and bend their aching eyes.</P>
<P>CHIEF of the windy Morven, begun the maid of the arms of snow; let me rest in thy bounding ship, far from the love of Corlo. For he, like the thunder of the desart, is terrible to Inibaca. He loves me in the gloom of his pride, and shakes ten thousand spears.</P>
<P>REST thou in peace, said the mighty Trenmor, behind the shield of my fathers. I will not fly from the chief, though he shakes ten thousand spears.</P>
<P>THREE days he waited on the shore; and sent his horn abroad. He called Corlo to battle from all his ecchoing hills. But Corlo came not to battle. The king of Lochlin descended. He feasted on the roaring shore; and gave the maid to Trenmor.</P>
<P>KING of Lochlin, said Fingal, thy blood flows in the veins of thy foe. Our families met in battle, because they loved the strife of spears. But often did they feast in the hall; and send round the joy of the shell.—Let thy face brighten with gladness, and thine far delight in the harp. Dreadful as the storm of thine ocean, thou hast poured thy valour forth; thy voice has been like the voice of thousands when they engage in battle. Raise, to-morrow, thy white sails to the wind, thou brother of Agandecca. Bright as the beam of noon she comes on my mournful soul. I have seen thy tears for the fair one, and spared thee in the halls of Starno; when my sword was red with slaughter, and my eye full of tears for the maid.—Or dost thou chuse the fight? The combat which thy fathers gave to Trenmor is thine: that thou mayest depart renown∣ed like the sun setting in the west.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="107"/>
KING of the race of Morven, said the chief of the waves of Lochlin; never will Swaran fight with thee, first of a thousand heroes! I have seen thee in the halls of Starno, and few were thy years beyond my own.—When shall I, I said to my soul, lift the spear like the noble Fingal? We have fought heretofore, O warrior, on the side of the shaggy Malmor; after my waves had carried me to thy halls, and the feast of a thousand shells was spread. Let the bards send him who overcame to future years, for noble was the strife of heathy Malmor.</P>
<P>BUT many of the ships of Lochlin have lost their youths on Lena. Take these, thou king of Morven, and be the friend of Swaran. And when thy sons shall come to the mossy towers of Gormal; the feast of shells shall be spread, and the combat offered on the vale.</P>
<P>NOR ship, replied the king, shall Fingal take, nor land of many hills. The desart is enough to me with all its deer and woods. Rise on thy waves again, thou noble friend of Agandecca. Spread thy white sails to the beam of the morning, and return to the ecchoing hills of Gormal.</P>
<P>BLEST be thy soul, thou king of shells, said Swaran of the dark-brown shield. In peace thou art the gale of spring. In war the mountain-storm. Take now my hand in friendship, thou noble king of Morven.</P>
<P>LET thy bards mourn those who fell. Let Erin give the sons of Lochlin to earth; and raise the mossy stones of their fame. That the children of the north hereafter may behold the place where their fathers fought. And some hunter may say, when he leans on a
<PB N="79" REF="108"/>
mossy tomb, here Fingal and Swaran fought, the heroes of other years. Thus hereafter shall he say, and our fame shall last for ever.</P>
<P>SWARAN, said the king of the hills, to-day our fame is greatest. We shall pass away like a dream. No sound will be in the fields of our battles. Our tombs will be lost in the heath. The hunter shall not know the place of our rest. Our names may be heard in the song, but the strength of our arms will cease.</P>
<P>O OSSRAN, Carril, and Ullin, you know of heroes that are no more. Give us the song of other years. Let the night pass away on the sound, and morning return with joy.</P>
<P>WE gave the song to the kings, and a hundred harps accom∣panied our voice. The face of Swaran brightened like the full moon of heaven, when the clouds vanish away, and leave her calm and broad in the midst of the sky.</P>
<P>IT was then that Fingal spoke to Carril the chief of other times. Where is the son of Semo; the king of the isle of mist? has he re∣tired, like the meteor of death, to the dreary cave of Tura?</P>
<P>CUCHULLIN, said Carril of other times, lies in the dreary cave of Tura. His hand is on the sword of his strength. His thoughts on the battles which he lost. Mournful is the king of spears, for he has often been victorious. He sends the sword of his war to rest on the side of Fingal. For, like the storm of the desart, thou hast scattered all his foes. Take, O Fingal, the sword of the hero; for his fame is departed like mist when it flies before the rustling wind of the vale.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="109"/>
NO: replied the king, Fingal shall never take his sword. His arm is mighty in war; and tell him his fame shall never fail. Many have been overcome in battle, that have shone afterwards like the sun of heaven.</P>
<P>O SWARAN, king of the resounding woods, give all thy grief away.—The vanquished, if brave, are renowned; they are like the sun in a cloud when he hides his face in the south, but looks again on the hills of grass.</P>
<P>GRUMAL was a chief of Cona. He sought the battle on every coast. His soul rejoiced in blood; his ear in the din of arms. He poured his warriors on the sounding Craca; and Craca's king met him from his grove; for then within the circle of Brumo<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This passage alludes to the religion of the king of Craca. See a note on a similar subject in the third book.</NOTE> he spoke to the stone of power.</P>
<P>FIERCE was the battle of the heroes, for the maid of the breast of snow. The fame of the daughter of Craca had reached Grumal at the streams of Cona; he vowed to have the white-bosomed maid, or die on the ecchoing Craca. Three days they strove together, and Grumal on the fourth was bound.</P>
<P>FAR from his friends they placed him in the horrid circle of Brumo; where often, they said, the ghosts of the dead howled round the stone of their fear. But afterwards he shone like a pillar of the light of heaven. They fell by his mighty hand, and Grumal had his fame.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="110"/>
RAISE, ye bards of other times, raise high the praise of heroes; that my soul may settle on their fame; and the mind of Swaran cease to be sad.</P>
<P>THEY lay in the heath of Mora; the dark winds rustle over the heroes.—A hundred voices at once arose, a hundred harps were strung; they sung of other times, and the mighty chiefs of for∣mer years.</P>
<P>WHEN now shall I hear the bard; or rejoice at the fame of my fathers? The harp is not strung on Morven; nor the voice of music raised on Cona. Dead with the mighty is the bard; and fame is in the desart no more.</P>
<P>MORNING trembles with the beam of the cast, and glimmers on gray-headed Cromla. Over Lena is heard the horn of Swaran, and the sons of the ocean gather around.—Silent and sad they mount the wave, and the blast of Ullin is behind their sails. White, as the mist of Morven, they float along the sea.</P>
<P>CALL, said Fingal, call my dogs, the long-bounding sons of the chace. Call white-breasted Bran; and the surly strength of Luath.—Fillan, and Ryno—but he is not here; my son rests on the bed of death. Fillan and Fergus, blow my horn, that the joy of the chace may arise; that the deer of Cromla may hear and start at the lake of roes.</P>
<P>THE shrill sound spreads along the wood. The sons of heathy Cromla arise.—A thousand dogs fly off at once, gray-bounding
<PB N="82" REF="111"/>
through the divided heath. A deer fell by every dog, and three by the white-breasted Bran. He brought them, in their flight, to Fin∣gal, that the joy of the king might be great.</P>
<P>ONE deer fell at the tomb of Ryno; and the grief of Fingal re∣turned. He saw how peaceful lay the stone of him who was the first at the chace.—No more shalt thou rise, O my son, to par∣take of the feast of Cromla. Soon will thy tomb be hid, and the grass grow rank on thy grave. The sons of the feeble shall pass over it, and shall not know that the mighty lie there.</P>
<P>OSSIAN and Fillan, sons of my strength, and Gaul king of the blue blades of war, let us ascend the hill to the cave of Tura, and find the chief of the battles of Erin.—Are these the walls of Tura, gray and lonely they rise on the heath? The king of shells is sad, and the halls are desolate. Come let us find the king of swords, and give him all our joy.</P>
<P>BUT is that Cuchullin, O Fillan, or a pillar of smoke on the heath? The wind of Cromla is on my eyes, and I distinguish not my friend.</P>
<P>FINGAL! replied the youth, it is the son of Semo. Gloomy and sad is the hero; his hand is on his sword. Hail to the son of battle, breaker of the shields!</P>
<P>HAIL to thee, replied Cuchullin, hail to all the sons of Morven. Delightful is thy presence, O Fingal, it is like the sun on Cromla; when the hunter mourns his absence for a season, and sees him be∣tween
<PB N="83" REF="112"/>
the clouds. Thy sons are like stars that attend thy course, and give light in the night.</P>
<P>IT is not thus thou hast seen me, O Fingal, returning from the wars of the desart; when the kings of the world<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is the only passage in the poem, wherein the wars of Fingal against the Romans are alluded to:—The Roman emperor is distinguished in old composition by the title of <HI>king of the world.</HI></NOTE> had fled, and joy returned to the hill of hinds.</P>
<P>MANY are thy words, Cuchullin, said Connan<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Connan was of the family of Morni. He is mentioned in several other poems, and always appears with the same cha∣racter. The poet passed him over in si∣lence till now, and his behaviour here deserves no better usage.</NOTE> of the small re∣nown. Thy words are many, son of Semo, but where are thy deeds in arms? Why did we come, over the ocean, to aid thy feeble sword? Thou flyest to thy cave of sorrow, and Connan fights thy battles; Resign to me these arms of light; yield them, thou son of Erin.</P>
<P>NO hero, replied the chief, ever sought the arms of Cuchullin; and had a thousand heroes sought them it were in vain, thou gloo∣my youth. I fled not to the cave of sorrow, as long as Erin's warriors lived.</P>
<P>YOUTH of the feeble arm, said Fingal, Connan, say no more. Cuchullin is renowned in battle, and terrible over the desart. Often have I heard thy fame, thou stormy chief of Inisfail. Spread now thy white sails for the isle of mist, and see Bragela leaning on her rock. Her tender eye is in tears, and the winds lift her long hair from her heaving breast. She listens to the winds of night to hear
<PB N="84" REF="113"/>
the voice of thy rowers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The practice of singing when they row northwest coast of Scotland and the isles. is universal among the inhabitants of the It deceives time, and inspirits the rowers.</NOTE>; to hear the song of the sea, and the sound of thy distant harp.</P>
<P>AND long shall she listen in vain; Cuchullin shall never return. How can I behold Bragela to raise the sigh of her breast? Fingal, I was always victorious in the battles of other spears!</P>
<P>AND hereafter thou shalt be victorious, said Fingal king of shells. The fame of Cuchullin shall grow like the branchy tree of Cromla. Many battles await thee, O chief, and many shall be the wounds of thy hand.</P>
<P>BRING hither, Oscar, the deer, and prepare the seast of shells; that our souls may rejoice after danger, and our friends delight in our presence.</P>
<P>WE sat, we feasted, and we sung. The soul of Cuchullin rose. The strength of his arm returned; and gladness brightened on his face.</P>
<P>ULLIN gave the song, and Carril raised the voice. I, often, join∣ed the bards, and sung of battles of the spear.—Battles! where I often fought; but now I fight no more. The fame of my former actions is ceased; and I sit forlorn at the tombs of my friends.</P>
<P>THUS they passed the night in the song; and brought back the morning with joy. Fingal arose on the heath, and shook his glit∣tering spear in his hand.—He moved first toward the plains of Lena, and we followed like a ridge of fire.</P>

<HEAD>COMÁLA: A DRAMATIC POEM<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This poem is valuable on account of the light it throws on the antiquity of Os∣sian's compositions. The Caracul men∣tioned here is the same with Caracalla the son of Severus, who in the year 211 com∣manded an expedition against the Caledo∣nians.—The variety of the measure shews that the poem was originally set to music, and perhaps presented before the chiefs upon solemn occasions.—Tradition has handed down the story more complete than it is in the poem—<Q REND="inline">"Comala, the daughter of Sarno king of Inistore or Orkney islands, fell in love with Fingal the son of Comhal at a feast, to which her father had invited him, [Fingal, B. III.] upon his return from Lochlin, after the death of Agan∣decca. Her passion was so violent, that she followed him, disguised like a youth, who wanted to be employed in his wars. She was soon discovered by Hidallan the son of Lamor, one of Fingal's heroes, whose love she had slighted some time before—Her ro∣mantic passion and beauty recommended her so much to the king, that he had re∣solved to make her his wife; when news was brought him of Caracul's expedition. He marched to stop the progress of the enemy, and Comala attended him.—He left her on a hill, within sight of Cara∣cul's army, when he himself went to battle, having previously promised, if he survived, to return that night."</Q> The sequel of the story may be gathered from the poem itself.</NOTE>.</HEAD>

<HEAD>THE WAR of CAROS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> Caros is probably the noted usurper Carausius, by birth a Menapian, who as∣sumed the purple in the year 284; and, seizing on Britain, defeated the emperor Maximian Herculius in several naval en∣gagements, which gives propriety to his being called in this poem <HI>the king of ships.</HI>—He repaired Agricola's wall, in order to obstruct the incursions of the Caledo∣nians; and when he was employed in that work, it appears he was attacked by a party under the command of Oscar the son of Ossian. This battle is the foundation of the present poem, which is addressed to Malvina the daughter of Toscar.</NOTE>: A POEM.</HEAD>
<P>BRING, daughter of Toscar, bring the harp; the light of the song rises in Ossian's soul. It is like the field, when darkness covers the hills around, and the shadow grows slowly on the plain of the sun.</P>
<P>I BEHOLD my son, O Malvina, near the mossy rock of Crona<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Crona is the name of a small stream which runs into the Carron. On its banks is the scene of the preceding drama∣tic poem.</NOTE>; but it is the mist<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">Who <HI>is</HI> this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke.
<BIBL>SOLOMON's Song.</BIBL></Q></NOTE> of the desart tinged with the beam of the west: Lovely is the mist that assumes the form of Oscar! turn from it, ye winds, when ye roar on the side of Ardven.</P>
<P>WHO comes towards my son, with the murmur of a song? His staff is in his hand, his gray hair loose on the wind. Surly joy
<PB N="96" REF="124"/>
lightens his face; and he often looks back to Caros. It is Ryno<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> Ryno is often mentioned in the an∣cient poetry.—He seems to have been a bard, of the first rank, in the days of Fingal.</NOTE> of the song, he that went to view the foe.</P>
<P>WHAT does Caros king of ships, said the son of the now mourn∣ful Ossian? spreads he the wings<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"> The Roman eagle.</NOTE> of his pride, bard of the times of old?</P>
<P>HE spreads them, Oscar, replied the bard, but it is behind his gathered heap<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"> Agricola's wall which Carausius re∣paired.</NOTE>. He looks over his stones with fear, and beholds thee terrible, as the ghost of night that rolls the wave to his ships.</P>
<P>GO, thou first of my bards, says Oscar, and take the spear of Fin∣gal. Fix a flame on its point, and shake it to the winds of heaven. Bid him, in songs, to advance, and leave the rolling of his wave. Tell to Caros that I long for battle; and that my bow is weary of the chace of Cona. Tell him the mighty are not here; and that my arm is young.</P>
<P>HE went with the murmur of his song. Oscar reared his voice on high. It reached his heroes on Ardven, like the noise of a cave<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>—As when the hollow rocks retain</L><L>The sound of blustering winds.—</L>
<BIBL>MILTON.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>; when the sea of Togorma rolls before it; and its trees meet the roaring winds.—They gather round my son like the streams of the hill; when, after rain, they roll in the pride of their course.</P>
<P>RYNO came to the mighty Caros, and struck his flaming spear. Come to the battle of Oscar, O thou that sittest on the rolling of waters. Fingal is distant far; he hears the songs of his bards in
<PB N="97" REF="125"/>
Morven: and the wind of his hall is in his hair. His terrible spear is at his side; and his shield that is like that darkened moon. Come to the battle of Oscar; the hero is alone.</P>
<P>HE came not over the streamy Carun<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> The river Carron.</NOTE>; the bard returned with his song. Gray night grows dim on Crona. The feast of shells is spread. A hundred oaks burn to the wind, and faint light gleams over the heath. The ghosts of Ardven pass through the beam, and shew their dim and distant forms. Comala<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"> This is the scene of Comala's death, which is the subject of the dramatic poem.—The poet mentions her in this place, in order to introduce the sequel of Hidallan's story, who, on account of her death, had been expelled from the wars of singal.</NOTE> is half-unseen on her meteor; and Hidallan is sullen and dim, like the darkened moon behind the mist of night.</P>
<P>WHY art thou sad? said Ryno; for he alone beheld the chief. Why art thou sad, Hidallan, hast thou not received thy fame? The songs of Ossian have been heard, and thy ghost has brightened in the wind, when thou didst bend from thy cloud to hear the song of Morven's bard.</P>
<P>AND do thine eyes behold the hero, said Oscar, like the dim meteor of night? Say, Ryno, say, how fell the chief that was so re∣nowned in the days of our fathers?—His name remains on the rocks of Cona; and I have often seen the streams of his hills.</P>
<P>FINGAL, replied the bard, had driven Hidallan from his wars. The king's soul was sad for Comala, and his eyes could not behold Hidallan.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="126"/>
LONELY, sad along the heath he slowly moved with silent steps. His arms hang disordered on his side. His hair flies loose from his helmet. The tear is in his down-cast eyes; and the sigh half-silent in his breast.</P>
<P>THREE days he strayed unseen, alone, before he came to La∣mor's halls: the mossy halls of his fathers, at the stream of Balva<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> This is perhaps that small stream, still retaining the name of Balva, which runs through the romantic valley of Glen∣tivar in Stirlingshire. Balva signifies <HI>a silent stream;</HI> and Glentivar, <HI>the sequestered vale.</HI></NOTE>.—There Lamor sat alone beneath a tree; for he had sent his people with Hidallan to war. The stream ran at his feet, and his gray head rested on his staff. Sightless are his aged eyes. He hums the song of other times.—The noise of Hidallan's feet came to his ear: he knew the tread of his son.</P>
<P>IS the son of Lamor returned; or is it the sound of his ghost? Hast thou fallen on the banks of Carun, son of the aged Lamor? Or, if I hear the sound of Hidallan's feet; where are the mighty in the war? where are my people, Hidallan, that were wont to return with their echoing shields?—Have they fallen on the banks of Carun?</P>
<P>NO: replied the sighing youth, the people of Lamor live. They are renowned in battle, my father; but Hidallan is renowned no more. I must sit alone on the banks of Balva, when the roar of the battle grows.</P>
<P>BUT thy fathers never sat alone, replied the rising pride of La∣mor; they never sat alone on the banks of Balva, when the roar of battle rose.—Dost thou not behold that tomb? My eyes discern
<PB N="99" REF="127"/>
it not; there rests the noble Garmállon who never fled from war.—Come, thou renowned in battle, he says, come to thy father's tomb.—How am I renowned, Garmállon, for my son has fled from war?</P>
<P>KING of the streamy Balva! said Hidallan with a sigh, why dost thou torment my soul? Lamor, I never feared.—Fingal was sad for Comala, and denied his wars to Hidallan; go to the gray streams of thy land, he said, and moulder like a leafless oak, which the winds have bent over Balva, never more to grow.</P>
<P>AND must I hear, Lamor replied, the lonely tread of Hidallan's feet? When thousands are renowned in battle, shall he bend over my gray streams? Spirit of the noble Garmállon! carry Lamor to his place; his eyes are dark; his soul is sad; and his son has lost his fame.</P>
<P>WHERE, said the youth, shall I search for same to gladden the soul of Lamor? From whence shall I return with renown, that the sound of my arms may be pleasant in his ear?—If I go to the chace of hinds, my name will not be heard.—Lamor will not feel my dogs, with his hands, glad at my arrival from the hill. He will not enquire of his mountains, or of the dark-brown deer of his desarts.</P>
<P>I MUST fall, said Lamor, like a leafless oak: it grew on a rock, but the winds have overturned it.—My ghost will be seen on my hills, mournful for my young Hidallan. Will not ye, ye mists, as ye rise, hide him from my sight?—My son!—go to Lamor's hall: there the arms of our fathers hang.—Bring the sword of Gar∣mállon;—he took it from a foe.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="128"/>
HE went and brought the sword with all its studded thongs.—He gave it to his father. The gray-haired hero felt the point with his hand.—</P>
<P>MY son!—lead me to Garmállon's tomb: it rises beside that rust∣ling tree. The long grass is withered;—I heard the breeze whist∣ling there.—A little fountain murmurs near, and sends its water to Balva. There let me rest; it is noon: and the sun is on our fields.</P>
<P>HE led him to Garmállon's tomb. Lamor pierced the side of his son.—They sleep together: and their ancient halls moulder on Balva's banks.—Ghosts are seen there at noon: the valley is silent, and the people shun the place of Lamor.</P>
<P>MOURNFUL is thy tale, said Oscar, son of the times of old!—My soul sighs for Hidallan; he fell in the days of his youth. He flies on the blast of the desart, and his wandering is in a foreign land.—</P>
<P>SONS of the ecchoing Morven! draw near to the foes of Fingal. Send the night away in songs; and watch the strength of Caros. Oscar goes to the people of other times; to the shades of silent Ard∣ven; where his fathers sit dim in their clouds, and behold the future war.—And art thou there, Hidallan, like a half-extinguished meteor? Come to my sight, in thy sorrow, chief of the roaring Balva!</P>
<P>THE heroes move with their songs.—Oscar slowly ascends the hill.—The meteors of night set on the heath before him. A distant torrent faintly roars.—Unfrequent blasts rush through aged oaks. The half-enlightened moon sinks dim and red behind her hill.—Feeble voices are heard on the heath.—Oscar drew his sword.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="129"/>
COME, said the hero, O ye ghosts of my fathers! ye that fought against the kings of the world!—Tell me the deeds of future times; and your converse in your caves; when you talk together and behold your sons in the fields of the valiant.</P>
<P>TRENMOR came, from his hill, at the voice of his mighty son.—A cloud, like the steed of the stranger, supported his airy limbs. His robe is of the mist of Lano, that brings death to the people. His sword is a green meteor half-extinguished. His face is with∣out form, and dark. He sighed thrice over the hero: and thrice the winds of the night roared around. Many were his words to Oscar: but they only came by halves to our ears: they were dark as the tales of other times, before the light of the song arose. He slowly vanished, like a mist that melts on the sunny hill.</P>
<P>IT was then, O daughter of Toscar, my son begun first to be sad. He foresaw the fall of his race; and, at times, he was thoughtful and dark; like the sun<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L><HI>—caput obscura nitidum ferrugine texit,</HI></L><BIBL>VIRG.</BIBL></Q></NOTE> when he carries a cloud on his face; but he looks afterwards on the hills of Cona.</P>
<P>OSCAR passed the night among his fathers, gray morning met him on the banks of Carun.</P>
<P>A GREEN vale surrounded a tomb which arose in the times of old. Little hills lift their head at a distance; and stretch their old trees to the wind. The warriors of Caros sat there, for they had passed the stream by night. They appeared, like the trunks of aged pines, to the pale light of the morning.</P>
<P>OSCAR stood at the tomb, and raised thrice his terrible voice. The rocking hills ecchoed around: the starting roes bounded away.
<PB N="102" REF="130"/>
And the trembling ghosts of the dead fled, shrieking on their clouds. So terrible was the voice of my son, when he called his friends.</P>
<P>A THOUSAND spears rose around; the people of Caros rose.—Why, daughter of Toscar, why that tear? My son, though alone, is brave. Oscar is like a beam of the sky; he turns around and the people fall. His hand is like the arm of a ghost, when he stretches it from a cloud: the rest of his thin form is unseen: but the people die in the vale.</P>
<P>MY son beheld the approach of the foe; and he stood in the si∣lent darkness of his strength.—<Q REND="inline">"Am I alone, said Oscar, in the midst of a thousand foes?—Many a spear is there!—many a darkly-rolling eye!—Shall I fly to Ardven?—But did my fathers ever fly!—The mark of their arm is in a thousand battles.—Oscar too will be renowned.—Come, ye dim ghosts of my fathers, and behold my deeds in war!—I may fall; but I will be renowned like the race of the ecchoing Morven<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This passage is very like the soliloquy of Ulysses upon a similar occasion.

<P>HE stood, growing in his place, like the flood of the narrow vale. The battle came, but they fell: bloody was the sword of Oscar.</P>
<P>THE noise reached his people at Crona; they came like a hundred streams. The warriors of Caros fled, and Oscar remained like a rock left by the ebbing sea.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="131"/>
NOW dark and deep, with all his steeds, Caros rolled his might along: the little streams are lost in his course; and the earth is rock∣ing round.—Battle spreads from wing to wing: ten thousand swords gleam at once in the sky.—But why should Ossian sing of battles?—For never more shall my steel shine in war. I remember the days of my youth with sorrow; when I feel the weakness of my arm. Happy are they who fell in their youth, in the midst of their renown!—They have not beheld the tombs of their friend: or fail∣ed to bend the bow of their strength.—Happy art thou, O Os∣car, in the midst of thy rushing blast. Thou often goest to the fields of thy fame, where Caros fled from thy lifted sword.</P>
<P>DARKNESS comes on my soul, O fair daughter of Toscar, I be∣hold not the form of my son at Carun; nor the figure of Oscar on Crona. The rustling winds have carried him far away; and the heart of his father is sad.</P>
<P>BUT lead me, O Malvina, to the found of my woods, and the roar of my mountain streams. Let the chace be heard on Cona; that I may think on the days of other years.—And bring me the harp, O maid, that I may touch it when the light of my soul shall arise.—Be thou near, to learn the song; and future times shall hear of Ossian.</P>
<P>THE sons of the feeble hereafter will lift the voice on Cona; and, looking up to the rocks, say, <Q REND="inline">"Here Ossian dwelt."</Q> They shall admire the chiefs of old, and the race that are no more: while we ride on our clouds, Malvina, on the wings of the roaring winds.

<HEAD>THE WAR of INIS-THONA<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Inis-thona, <HI>i. e. the island of waves,</HI> was a country of Scandinavia subject to its own king, but depending upon the king∣dom of Lochlin.—This poem is an episode introduced in a great work composed by Ossian, in which the actions of his friends, and his beloved son Oscar, were inter∣woven.—The work itself is lost, but some episodes, and the story of the poem, are handed down by tradition. There are some now living, who, in their youth, have heard the whole repeated.</NOTE>: A POEM.</HEAD>
<P>OUR youth is like the dream of the hunter on the hill of heath. He sleeps in the mild beams of the sun; but he awakes amidst a storm; the red lightning flies around: and the trees shake their heads to the wind. He looks back with joy, on the day of the sun; and the pleasant dreams of his rest!</P>
<P>WHEN shall Ossian's youth return, or his ear delight in the sound of arms? When shall I, like Oscar, travel<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q>Travelling in the greatness of his strength. <BIBL>ISAIAH lxiii. 1.</BIBL></Q></NOTE> in the light of my steel?—Come, with your streams, ye hills of Cona, and listen to the voice of Ossian! The song rises, like the sun, in my soul; and my heart feels the joys of other times.</P>
<P>I BEHOLD thy towers, O Selma! and the oaks of thy shaded wall:—thy streams sound in my ear; thy heroes gather round. Fingal sits in the midst; and leans on the shield of Trenmor:—his
<PB N="105" REF="133"/>
spear stands against the wall; he listens to the song of his bards.—The deeds of his arm are heard; and the actions of the king in his youth.</P>
<P>OSCAR had returned from the chace, and heard the hero's praise.—He took the shield of Branno<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is Branno, the father of Everal∣lin, and grandfather to Oscar; he was of Irish extraction and lord of the country round the lake of Lego.—His great actions are handed down by tradition, and his ho∣spitality has passed into a proverb.</NOTE> from the wall; his eyes were filled with tears. Red was the cheek of youth. His voice was trembling, low. My spear shook its bright head in his hand: he spoke to Morven's king.</P>
<P>FINGAL! thou king of heroes! Ossian, next to him in war! ye have fought the battle in your youth; your names are renowned in the song.—Oscar is like the mist of Cona; I appear and vanish.—The bard will not know my name.—The hunter will not search in the heath for my tomb. Let me fight, O heroes, in the battles of Inis-thona. Distant is the land of my war!—ye shall not hear of Oscar's fall.—Some bard may find me there, and give my name to the song.—The daughter of the stranger shall see my tomb, and weep over the youth that came from afar. The bard shall say, at the feast, hear the song of Oscar from the distant land!</P>
<P>OSCAR, replied the king of Morven; thou shalt fight, son of my fame!—Prepare my dark-bosomed ship to carry my hero to Inis-thona. Son of my son, regard our fame;—for thou art of the race of renown. Let not the children of strangers say, feeble are the sons of Morven!—Be thou, in battle, like the roaring storm: mild as the evening sun in peace.—Tell, Oscar, to Inis-thona's king, that Fingal remembers his youth; when we strove in the combat together in the days of Agandecca.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="134"/>
THEY lifted up the sounding sail; the wind whistled through the thongs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Leather thongs were used in Ossian's time, instead of ropes.</NOTE> of their masts. Waves lashthe oozy rocks: the strength of ocean roars.—My son beheld, from the wave, the land of groves. He rushed into the ecchoing bay of Runa; and sent his sword to Annir king of spears.</P>
<P>THE gray-haired hero rose, when he saw the sword of Fingal. His eyes were full of tears, and he remembered the battles of their youth. Twice they lifted the spear before the lovely Agandecca: heroes stood far distant, as if two ghosts contended.</P>
<P>BUT now, begun the king, I am old; the sword lies useless in my hall. Thou who art of Morven's race! Annir has been in the strife of spears; but he is pale and withered now, like the oak of Lano. I have no son to meet thee with joy, or to carry thee to the halls of his fathers.

BESIDE the fount of mossy stones, the weary heroes rest.

CORMALO, replied the king, is chief of ten thousand spears; he dwells at the dark-rolling waters of Lano<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lano was a lake of Scandinavia, remarkable, in the days of Ossian, for emitting a pestilential vapour in autumn. <Q REND="inline"><HI>And thou, O valiant Duchomar, like the mist of marshy Lano; when it sails over the plains of autumn, and brings death to the people.</HI> <BIBL>FINGAL, B.

He came to Runa's ecchoing halls, and sought the honour of the spear<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">By <HI>the honour of the spear</HI> is meant the tournament practised among the ancient northern nations.</NOTE>. The youth was lovely as the first beam of the sun; and few were they who could meet him in fight!—My heroes yielded to Cormalo: and my daughter loved the son of Lano.</P>
<P>ARGON and Ruro returned from the chace; the tears of their pride descend:—They rolled their silent eyes on Runa's heroes, be∣cause they yielded to a stranger: three days they feasted with Cor∣malo: on the fourth my Argon fought.—But who could fight with Argon!—Lano's chief is overcome. His heart swelled with the grief of pride, and he resolved, in secret, to behold the death of my sons.</P>
<P>THEY went to the hills of Runa, and pursued the dark-brown hinds. The arrow of Cormalo flew in secret; and my children fell. He came to the maid of his love; to Inis-thona's dark-haired maid.—They fled over the desart—and Annir remained alone.</P>
<P>NIGHT came on and day appeared; nor Argon's voice, nor Ru∣ro's came. At length their much-loved dog is seen; the fleet and bounding Runar. He came into the hall and howled; and seemed to look towards the place of their fall.—We followed him: we found them here: and laid them by this mossy stream. This is the haunt of Annir, when the chace of the hinds is over. I bend like the trunk of an aged oak above them: and my tears for ever flow.</P>

O RONNAN! said the rising Oscar, Ogar king of spears! call my heroes to my side, the sons of streamy Morven. To-day we go to Lano's water, that sends forth the cloud of death. Cormalo will not long rejoice: death is often at the point of our swords.</P>
<P>THEY came over the desart like stormy clouds, when the winds roll them over the heath: their edges are tinged with lightning: and the ecchoing groves foresee the storm. The horn of Oscar's battle is heard; and Lano shook over all its waves. The children of the lake convened around the sounding shield of Cormalo.</P>
<P>OSCAR fought, as he was wont in battle. Cormalo fell beneath his sword: and the sons of the dismal Lano fled to their secret vales.—Oscar brought the daughter of Inis-thona to Annir's ecchoing halls. The face of age is bright with joy; he blest the king of swords.</P>
<P>HOW great was the joy of Ossian, when he beheld the distant sail of his son! it was like a cloud of light that rises in the east, when the traveller is sad in a land unknown; and dismal night, with her ghosts, is sitting around him.</P>
<P>WE brought him, with songs, to Selma's halls. Fingal ordered the feast of shells to be spread. A thousand bards raised the name of Oscar: and Morven answered to the noise. The daughter of Toscar was there, and her voice was like the harp; when the distant sound comes, in the evening, on the soft-rustling breeze of the vale.</P>
<P>O LAY me, ye that see the light, near some rock of my hills: let the thick hazels be around, let the rustling oak be near. Green be the place of my rest; and let the sound of the distant torrent be heard. Daughter of Toscar, take the harp, and raise the lovely

song of Selma; that sleep may overtake my soul in the midst of joy; that the dreams of my youth may return, and the days of the mighty Fingal.</P>
<P>SELMA! I behold thy towers, thy trees, and shaded wall. I see the heroes of Morven; and hear the song of bards. Oscar lifts the sword of Cormalo; and a thousand youths admire its studded thongs. They look with wonder on my son; and admire the strength of his arm. They mark the joy of his father's eyes; they long for an equal fame.</P>
<P>AND ye shall have your fame, O sons of streamy Morven.—My soul is often brightened with the song; and I remember the com∣panions of my youth.—But sleep descends with the sound of the harp; and pleasant dreams begin to rise. Ye sons of the chace stand far distant, nor disturb my rest<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">I charge you, O ye daughters of Je∣rusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please. <BIBL>SOLOMON's Song.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>.

<HEAD>THE BATTLE of LORA: A POEM<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This poem is compleat; nor does it appear from tradition, that it was intro∣duced, as an episode, into any of Ossian's great works.—It it called, in the original, <HI>Duan a Chuldich,</HI> or the <HI>Culdee's poem,</HI> because it was addressed to one of the first Christian missionaries, who were called, from their retired life, Culdees, or <HI>se∣questered persons.</HI>—The story bears a near resemblance to that which was the foun∣dation of the Iliad. Fingal, on his return from Ireland, after he had expelled Swa∣ran from that kingdom, made a feast to all his heroes: he forgot to invite Ma-ronnan and Aldo, two chiefs, who had not been along with him on his expedition. They resented his neglect; and went over to Er∣ragon king of Sora, a country of Scandi∣navia, the declared enemy of Fingal. The valour of Aldo soon gained him a great reputation in Sora: and Lorma the beauti∣ful wife of Erragon fell in love with him.—He found means to escape with her, and to come to Fingal, who resided then in Selma on the western coast.—Erragon in∣vaded Scotland, and was slain in battle by Gaul the son of Morni, after he had re∣jected terms of peace offered him by Fin∣gal.—In this war Aldo fell, in a single combat, by the hands of his rival Erragon; and the unfortunate Lorma afterwards died of grief.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>SON of the distant land, who dwellest in the secret cell! do I hear the sounds of thy grove? or is it thy voice of songs?—The torrent was loud in my ear, but I heard a tuneful voice; dost thou praise the chiefs of thy land; or the spirits<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The poet alludes to the religious hymns of the Culdees.</NOTE> of the wind?—But, lonely dweller of the rock! look over that heathy plain: thou seest green tombs, with their rank, whistling grass; with their stones

of mossy heads: thou seest them, son of the rock, but Ossian's eyes have failed.</P>
<P>A MOUNTAIN-STREAM comes roaring down and sends its wa∣ters round a green hill: four mossy stones, in the midst of withered grass, rear their heads on the top: two trees, which the storms have bent, spread their whistling branches around.—This is thy dwelling, Erragon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Erragon, or Ferg thonn, signifies <HI>the rage of the waves;</HI> probably a poetical name given him by Ossian himself; for he goes by the name of Annir in tradition.</NOTE>; this thy narrow house: the sound of thy shells have been long forgot in Sora: and thy shield is become dark in thy hall.—Erragon, king of ships! chief of distant Sora! how hast thou fallen on our mountains<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">The beauty of Israel is slain on thy high places: how are the mighty fallen! <BIBL>2 SAM. ii. 19.</BIBL></Q><Q REND="inline">How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle!

<P>SON of the secret cell! dost thou delight in songs? Hear the battle of Lora; the sound of its steel is long since past. So thun∣der on the darkened hill roars and is no more. The sun returns with his silent beams: the glittering rocks, and green heads of the mountains smile.</P>
<P>THE bay of Cona received our ships<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">This was at Fingal's return from his war against Swaran.</NOTE>, from Ullin's rolling waves: our white sheets hung loose to the masts: and the boisterous winds roared behind the groves of Morven.—The horn of the king is sounded, and the deer start from their rocks. Our arrows flew in the woods; the feast of the hill is spread. Our joy was great on our rocks, for the fall of the terrible Swaran.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="141"/>
TWO heroes were forgot at our feast; and the rage of their bo∣soms burned. They rolled their red eyes in secret: the sigh bursts from their breasts. They were seen to talk together, and to throw their spears on earth. They were two dark clouds, in the midst of our joy; like pillars of mist on the settled sea: it glitters to the sun, but the mariners fear a storm.</P>
<P>RAISE my white sails, said Ma-ronnan, raise them to the winds of the west; let us rush, O Aldo, through the foam of the northern wave. We are forgot at the feast: but our arms have been red in blood. Let us leave the hills of Fingal, and serve the king of Sora.—His countenance is fierce, and the war darkens round his spear. Let us be renowned, O Aldo, in the battles of ecchoing Sora.</P>
<P>THEY took their swords and shields of thongs; and rushed to Lumar's sounding bay. They came to Sora's haughty king, the chief of bounding steeds.—Erragon had returned from the chace: his spear was red in blood. He bent his dark face to the ground: and whistled as he went.—He took the strangers to his feasts: they fought and conquered in his wars.</P>
<P>ALDO returned with his fame towards Sora's lofty walls.—From her tower looked the spouse of Erragon, the humid, rolling eyes of Lorma.—Her dark-brown hair flies on the wind of ocean: her white breast heaves, like snow on heath; when the gentle winds arise, and slowly move it in the light. She saw young Aldo, like the beam of Sora's setting sun. Her soft heart sighed: tears filled her eyes; and her white arm supported her head.</P>
<P>THREE days she sat within the hall, and covered grief with joy.—On the fourth she fled with the hero, along the rolling sea.—They came to Cona's mossy towers, to Fingal king of spears.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="142"/>
ALDO of the heart of pride! said the rising king of Morven, shall I defend thee from the wrath of Sora's injured king? who will now receive my people into their halls, or give the feast of strangers, since Aldo, of the little soul, has carried away the fair of Sora? Go to thy hills, thou feeble hand, and hide thee in thy caves; mourn∣ful is the battle we must fight, with Sora's gloomy king.—Spirit of the noble Trenmor! When will Fingal cease to fight? I was born in the midst of battles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Comhal the Father of Fingal was slain in battle, against the tribe of Morni, the very day that Fingal was born; so that he may, with propriety, be said to have been <HI>born in the midst of battles.</HI></NOTE>, and my steps must move in blood to my tomb. But my hand did not injure the weak, my steel did not touch the feeble in arms.—I behold thy tempests, O Morven, which will overtrun my halls; when my children are dead in battle, and none remains to dwell in Selma. Then will the feeble come, but they will not know my tomb: my renown is in the song: and my actions shall be as a dream to future times.</P>
<P>HIS people gathered around Erragon, as the storms round the ghost of night; when he calls them from the top of Morven, and prepares to pour them on the land of the stranger.—He came to the shore of Cona, and sent his bard to the king; to demand the combat of thousands; or the land of many hills.</P>
<P>FINGAL sat in his hall with the companions of his youth around him. The young heroes were at the chace, and far distant in the desart. The gray-haired chiefs talked of other times, and of the actions of their youth; when the aged Narthmor<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Neart-mór, <HI>great strength.</HI> Lora, <HI>noisy.</HI></NOTE> came, the king of streamy Lora.</P>
<P>THIS is no time, begun the chief, to hear the songs of other years: Erragon frowns on the coast, and lifts ten thousand swords. Gloomy

is the king among his chiefs! he is like the darkened moon, amidst the meteors of night.</P>
<P>COME, said Fingal, from thy hall, thou daughter of my love; come from thy hall, Bosmina<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bos-mhina, <HI>soft and tender hand.</HI> She was the youngest of Fingal's children.</NOTE>, maid of streamy Morven!

<P>SHE came to the host of Erragon, like a beam of light to a cloud.—In her right hand shone an arrow of gold: and in her left a sparkling shell, the sign of Morven's peace.</P>
<P>ERRAGON brightened in her presence as a rock, before the sud∣den beams of the sun; when they issue from a broken cloud, divid∣ed by the roaring wind.</P>
<P>SON of the distant Sora, begun the mildly blushing maid, come to the feast of Morven's king, to Selma's shaded walls. Take the peace of heroes, O warrior, and let the dark sword rest by thy side.—And if thou chusest the wealth of kings, hear the words of the generous Aldo.—He gives to Erragon an hundred steeds, the children of the rein; an hundred maids from distant lands; an hundred hawks with fluttering wing, that fly across the sky. An hundred girdles<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Sanctified girdles, till very lately, were kept in many families in the north of Scot∣land; they were bound about women in labour, and were supposed to alleviate their pains, and to accelerate the birth.

the births of heroes, and the cure of the sons of toil.—Ten shells studded with gems shall shine in Sora's towers: the blue water trembles on their stars, and seems to be sparkling wine.—They gladdened once the kings of the world<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Roman emperors. These shells were some of the spoils of the province.</NOTE>, in the midst of their ec∣choing halls. These, O hero, shall be thine; or thy white-bosom∣ed spouse.—Lorma shall roll her bright eyes in thy halls; though Fingal loves the generous Aldo:—Fingal!—who never injured a hero, though his arm is strong.</P>
<P>SOFT voice of Cona! replied the king, tell him, that he spreads his feast in vain.—Let Fingal pour his spoils around me; and bend beneath my power. Let him give me the swords of his fa∣thers, and the shields of other times; that my children may be∣hold them in my halls, and say, <Q REND="inline">"These are the arms of Fingal."</Q></P>
<P>NEVER shall they behold them in thy halls, said the rising pride of the maid; they are in the mighty hands of heroes who never yielded in war.—King of the ecchoing Sora! the storm is gathering on our hills. Dost thou not foresee the fall of thy people, son of the distant land?</P>
<P>SHE came to Selma's silent halls; the king beheld her down-cast eyes. He rose from his place, in his strength, and shook his aged locks.—He took the sounding mail of Trenmor, and the dark-brown shield of his fathers. Darkness filled Selma's hall, when he stretch∣ed his hand to his spear:—the ghosts of thousands were near, and
<PB N="117" REF="145"/>
foresaw the death of the people. Terrible joy rose in the face of the aged heroes: they rushed to meet the foe; their thoughts are on the actions of other years: and on the fame of the tomb.</P>
<P>NOW the dogs of the chace appeared at Trathal's tomb: Fingal know that his young heroes followed them, and he stopt in the midst of his course.—Oscar appeared the first;—then Morni's son, and Nemi's race:—Fercuth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fear-cuth, the same with Fergus, <HI>the man of the word,</HI> or a commander of an army.</NOTE> shewed his gloomy form: Dermid spread his dark hair on the wind. Ossian came the last, O son of the rock<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The poet addresses himself to the Culdee.</NOTE>, I hummed the song of other times: my spear supported my steps over the little streams, and my thoughts were of mighty men. Fingal struck his bossy shield; and gave the dismal sign of war; a thousand swords<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>He spake; and to confirm his words out-slew.</L>
<L>Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs</L>

<BIBL>MILTON.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>, at once unsheathed, gleam on the wav∣ing heath. Three gray-haired sons of the song raise the tunesul, mournful voice.—Deep and dark with sounding steps, we rush, a gloomy ridge, along: like the shower of a storm when it pours on the narrow vale.</P>
<P>THE king of Morven sat on his hill: the sun-beam<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"> I have observed in a former note, that the standard of Fingal was called the sun-beam from its being studded with stones and gold.</NOTE> of battle flew on the wind: the companions of his youth are near, with all their waving locks of age.—Joy rose in the hero's eyes when he beheld his sons in war; when he saw them amidst the lightning of swords, and mindful of the deeds of their fathers.—Erragon came on, in his strength, like the roar of a winter stream: the battle falls in his course, and death is at his side.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="146"/>
WHO comes, said Fingal, like the bounding roe, like the hart of ecchoing Cona? His shield glitters on his side; and the clang of his armour is mournful.—He meets with Erragon in the strife!—Behold the battle of the chiefs!—it is like the contending of ghosts in a gloomy storm.—But fallest thou, son of the hill, and is thy white bosom stained with blood? Weep, unhappy Lorma, Aldo is no more.</P>
<P>THE king took the spear of his strength; for he was sad for the fall of Aldo: he bent his deathful eyes on the foe; but Gaul met the king of Sora.—Who can relate the fight of the chiefs?—The mighty stranger fell.</P>
<P>SONS of Cona! Fingal cried aloud, stop the hand of death.—Mighty was he that is now so low! and much is he mourned in Sora! The stranger will come towards his hall, and wonder why it is silent. The king is fallen, O stranger, and the joy of his house is ceased.—Listen to the sound of his woods: perhaps his ghost is there; but he is far distant, on Morven, beneath the sword of a foreign foe.</P>
<P>SUCH were the words of Fingal, when the bard raised the song of peace; we stopped our uplifted swords, and spared the feeble foe. We laid Erragon in that tomb; and I raised the voice of grief: the clouds of night came rolling down, and the ghost of Erragon appeared to some.—His face was cloudy and dark; and an half∣sormed sigh is in his breast.—Blest be thy soul, O king of Sora! thine arm was terrible in war!</P>
<P>Lorma sat, in Aldo's hall, at the light of a flaming oak: the night came, but he did not return; and the soul of Lorma is sad.—What detains thee, hunter of Cona? for thou didst promise to
<PB N="119" REF="147"/>
return.—Has the deer been distant far; and do the dark winds sigh, round thee, on the heath? I am in the land of strangers, where is my friend, but Aldo? Come from thy ecchoing hills, O my best beloved!</P>
<P>HER eyes are turned toward the gate, and she listens to the rust∣ling blast. She thinks it is Aldo's tread, and joy rises in her sace:—but sorrow returns again, like a thin cloud on the moon.—And thou wilt not return, my love? Let me behold the face of the hill. The moon is in the east. Calm and bright is the breast of the lake! When shall I behold his dogs returning from the chace? When shall I hear his voice, loud and distant on the wind? Come from thy ecchoing hills, hunter of woody Cona!</P>
<P>HIS thin ghost appeared, on a rock, like the watry beam of the moon, when it rushes from between two clouds, and the mid∣night shower is on the field.—She followed the empty sorm over the heath, for she knew that her hero fell.—I heard her approaching cries on the wind, like the mournsul voice of the breeze, when it sighs on the grass of the cave.</P>
<P>SHE came, she found her hero: her voice was heard no more: silent she rolled her sad eyes; she was pale as a watry cloud, that rises from the lake, to the beam of the moon.</P>
<P>FEW were her days on Cona: she sunk into the tomb: Fingal commanded his bards; and they sung over the death of Lorma. The daughters<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">The daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year. <BIBL>JUDGES xi. 40.</BIBL></Q></NOTE> of Morven mourned her sor one day in the year, when the dark winds of autumn returned.</P>

<HEAD>CONLATH and CUTHÓNA: A POEM<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Conlath was the youngest of Morni's sons, and brother to the celebrated Gaul, who is so often mentioned in Ossian's poems. He was in love with Cuthóna the daughter of Rumar, when Toscar the son of Kin∣fena, accompanied by Fercuth his friend, arrived, from Ireland, at Mora where Conlath dwelt. He was hospitably re∣ceived, and according to the custom of the times, feasted, three days, with Conlath. On the fourth he set fail, and coasting the <HI>island of waves,</HI> probably, one of the He∣brides, he saw Cuthóna hunting, fell in love with her, and carried her away, by force, in his ship. He was forced, by stress of weather, into I-thona a desart isle. In the mean-time Conlath, hearing of the rape, sailed after him, and found him on the point of sailing for the coast of Ireland. They fought; and they, and their followers fell by mutual wounds. Cuthóna did not long survive: for she died of grief the third day after. Fingal, hearing of their unfortunate death, sent Stormal the son of Moran to bury them, but forgot to send a bard to sing the funeral song over their tombs. The ghost of Conlath came, long after, to Os∣sian, to intreat him to transmit, to poste∣rity, his and Cuthona's fame. For it was the opinion of the times, that the souls of the deceased were not happy, till their elegies were composed by a bard.—Thus is the story of the poem handed down by tra∣dition.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>DID not Ossian hear a voice? or is it the sound of days that are no more? Often does the memory of former times come, like the evening sun, on my soul. The noise of the chace is renewed; and, in thought, I lift the spear.—But Ossian did hear a voice: Who art thou, son of the night? The sons of little men are asleep, and the midnight wind is in my hall. Perhaps it is the shield of Fingal that echoes to the blast, it hangs in Ossian's hall, and he feels
<PB N="122" REF="150"/>
it sometimes with his hands.—Yes!—I hear thee, my friend; long has thy voice been absent from mine ear! What brings thee, on thy cloud, to Ossian, son of the generous Morni?

<HEAD>CARTHON<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This poem is compleat, and the sub∣ject of it, as of most of Ossian's composi∣tions, tragical. In the time of Comhal the son of Trathal, and father of the cele∣brated Fingal, Clessámmor the son of Thaddu and brother of Morna, Fingal's mother, was driven by a storm into the river Clyde, on the banks of which stood Balclutha, a town belonging to the Bri∣tons between the walls. He was hospitably received by Reuthámir, the principal man in the place, who gave him Moina his only daughter in marriage. Reuda, the son of Cormo, a Briton who was in love with Moina, came to Reuthamir's house, and behaved haughtily towards Clessámmor. A quarrel insued, in which Reuda was killed; the Britons, who attended him pressed so hard on Clessámmor, that he was obliged to throw himself into the Clyde, and swim to his ship. He hoisted sail, and the wind being favourable, bore him out to sea. He often endeavoured to return, and carry off his beloved Moina by night; but the wind continuing contrary, he was forced to desist.</P>
<P>Moina, who had been left with child by her husband, brought forth a son, and died soon after.—Reuthamir named the child Carthon, <HI>i. e. the murmur of waves,</HI> from the storm which carried off Clessámmor his father, who was supposed to have been cast away. When Carthon was three years old, Comhal the father of Fingal, in one of his expeditions against the Britons, took and burnt Balclutha. Reuthámir was kil∣led in the attack: and Carthon was carried safe away by his nurse, who fled farther into the country of the Britons. Carthon, coming to man's estate was resolved to re∣venge the fall of Balclutha on Comhal's posterity. He set sail, from the Clyde, and, falling on the coast of Morven, de∣feated two of Fingal's heroes, who came to oppose his progress. He was, at last, un∣wittingly killed by his father Clessámmor, in a single combat. This story is the foundation of the present poem, which opens on the night preceding the death of Carthon, so that what passed before is in∣troduced by way of episode. The poem is addressed to Malvina the daughter of Tos∣car.</P></NOTE>: A POEM.</HEAD>
<P>A TALE of the times of old! The deeds of days of other years!—The murmur of thy streams, O Lora, brings back the memory of the past. The sound of thy woods, Garmallar, is lovely in mine ear. Dost thou not behold, Malvina, a rock with its head of heath? Three aged firs bend from its face; green is the narrow plain at its feet; there the flower of the mountain grows,

and shakes its white head in the breeze. The thistle is there alone, and shades its aged beard. Two stones, half sunk in the ground, shew their heads of moss.

<P>WHO comes from the land of strangers, with his thousands around him? the sun-beam pours its bright stream before him; and his hair meets the wind of his hills. His face is settled from war. He is calm as the evening beam that looks, from the cloud of the west, on Cona's silent vale.

<P>RETURNS the chief, said Clessámmor, in the midst of his fame? Such was the renown of Comhal in the battles of his youth. Often did we pass over Carun to the land of the strangers: our swords re∣turned, not unstained with blood: nor did the kings of the world rejoice.—Why do I remember the battles of my youth? My hair is mixed with gray. My hand forgets to bend the bow: and I lift

a lighter spear. O that my joy would return, as when I first be∣held the maid; the white bosomed daughter of strangers, Moina<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Moina, <HI>soft in temper and person.</HI> We find the British names in this poem derived from the Galic, which is a proof that the ancient language of the whole island was one and the same.</NOTE> with the dark-blue eyes!</P>
<P>TELL, said the mighty Fingal, the tale of thy youthful days. Sorrow, like a cloud on the sun, shades the soul of Clessámmor. Mournful are thy thoughts, alone, on the banks of the roaring Lora. Let us hear the sorrow of thy youth, and the darkness of thy days.</P>
<P>IT was in the days of peace, replied the great Clessámmor, I came, in my bounding ship, to Balclutha's<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Balclutha, <HI>i. e. the town of Clyde,</HI> pro∣bably the <HI>Alduth</HI> of Bede.</NOTE> walls of towers.

The joy of the shell went round, and the aged hero gave the fair. Her breasts were like foam on the wave, and her eyes like stars of light: her hair was dark as the raven's wing: her soul was generous and mild. My love for Moina was great: and my heart poured forth in joy.</P>
<P>THE son of a stranger came; a chief who loved the white-bosomed Moina. His words were mighty in the hall, and he often half-unsheathed his sword.—Where, he said, is the mighty Comhal, the restless wanderer<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">The word in the original here rendered by <HI>restless wanderer,</HI> is <HI>Scuta,</HI> which is the true origin of the <HI>Scoti</HI> of the Romans; an opprobrious name imposed by the Britons, on the Caledonians, on account of the con∣tinual incursions into their country.</NOTE> of the heath? Comes he, with his host, to Bal∣clutha, since Clessámmor is so bold?</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="159"/>
MY Soul, I replied, O warrior! burns in a light of its own. I stand without fear in the midst of thousands, though the valiant are distant far.—Stranger! thy words are mighty, for Clessammor is alone. But my sword trembles by my side, and longs to glitter in my hand.—Speak no more of Comhal, son of the winding Clutha!</P>
<P>THE strength of his pride arose. We fought; he fell beneath my sword. The banks of Clutha heard his fall, and a thousand spears glittered around. I fought: the strangers prevailed: I plunged into the stream of Clutha. My white sails rose over the waves, and I bounded on the dark-blue sea.—Moina came to the shore, and rolled the red eye of her tears: her dark hair flew on the wind; and I heard her cries.—Often did I turn my ship! but the winds of the East prevailed. Nor Clutha ever since have I seen: nor Moina of the dark brown hair.—She fell in Balclutha: for I have seen her ghost. I knew her as she came through the dusky night, along the murmur of Lora: she was like the new moon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L><HI>Inter quas Phoenissa recens a volnere Dido</HI></L>

The fire had resounded in the halls: and the voice of the people is heard no more. The stream of Clutha was removed from its place, by the fall of the walls.—The thistle shook, there, its lonely head: the moss whistled to the wind. The fox looked out, from the windows, the rank grass of the wall waved round his head.—Desolate is the dwelling of Moina, silence is in the house of her fathers.—Raise the song of mourn∣ing, O bards, over the land of strangers. They have but fallen before us: for, one day, we must fall.—Why dost thou build the hall, son of the winged days? Thou lookest from thy towers to-day; yet a few years, and the blast of the desart comes; it howls in thy empty court, and whistles round thy half-worn shield.—And let the blast of the desart come! we shall be renowned in our day. The mark of my arm shall be in the battle, and my name in the song of bards.—Raise the song; send round the shell: and let joy be heard in my hall.—When thou, sun of heaven, shalt fail! if thou shalt fail, thou mighty light! if thy brightness is for a season, like Fingal; our fame shall survive thy beams.</P>
<P>SUCH was the song of Fingal, in the day of his joy. His thou∣sand bards leaned forward from their seats, to hear the voice of the king. It was like the music of the harp on the gale of the spring.—Lovely were thy thoughts, O Fingal! why had not Ossian the strength of thy soul?—But thou standest alone, my father; and who can equal the king of Morven?</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="161"/>
THE night passed away in the song, and morning returned in joy;—the mountains shewed their gray heads; and the blue face of ocean smiled.—The white wave is seen tumbling round the distant rock; the gray mist rises, slowly, from the lake. It came, in the figure of an aged man, along the silent plain. Its large limbs did not move in steps; for a ghost supported it in mid air. It came towards Selma's hall, and dissolved in a shower of blood.</P>
<P>THE king alone beheld the terrible sight, and he foresaw the death of the people. He came, in silence, to his hall; and took his father's spear.—The mail rattled on his breast. The heroes rose around. They looked, in silence, on each other, marking the eyes of Fingal.—They saw the battle in his face: the death of armies on his spear.—A thousand shields, at once, are placed on their arms; and they drew a thousand swords. The hall of Selma brightened around. The clang of arms ascends.—The gray dogs howl in their place. No word is among the mighty chiefs.—Each marked the eyes of the King; and half assumed his spear.</P>
<P>SONS of Morven, begun the king, this is no time to fill the shell. The battle darkens near us; and death hovers over the land. Some ghost, the friend of Fingal, has forewarned us of the foe.—The sons of the stranger come from the darkly-rolling sea.

<P>THE hero moved on before his host, like a cloud before a ridge of green fire; when it pours on the sky of night, and mariners forsee a storm. On Cona's rising heath they stood: the white-bosomed maids beheld them above like a grove; they foresaw the death of their youths, and looked towards the sea with fear.—The white wave deceived them for distant sails, and the tear is on their cheek.</P>
<P>THE sun rose on the sea, and we beheld a distant fleet.—Like the mist of ocean they came: and poured their youth upon the coast.—The chief was among them, like the stag in the midst of the herd.—His shield is studded with gold, and stately strode the king of spears.—He moved towards Selma; his thousands moved behind.</P>
<P>GO, with thy song of peace, said Fingal; go, Ullin, to the king of swords. Tell him that we are mighty in battle; and that the ghosts of our foes are many.—But renowned are they who have feasted in my halls! they shew the arms<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">It was a custom among the ancient Scots, to exchange arms with their guests, and those arms were preserved long in the different families, as monuments of the friendship which subsisted between their an∣cestors.</NOTE> of my fathers in a foreign land: the sons of the strangers wonder, and bless the friends of Morven's race; for our names have been heard afar; the kings of the world shook in the midst of their people.</P>
<P>ULLIN went with his song. Fingal rested on his spear: he saw the mighty foe in his armour: and he blest the stranger's son.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="163"/>
HOW stately art thou, son of the sea! said the king of woody Morven. Thy sword is a beam of might by thy side: thy spear is a fir that defies the storm. The varied face of the moon is not broader than thy shield.—Ruddy is thy face of youth! soft the ringlets of thy hair!—But this tree may fall; and his memory be forgot!—The daughter of the stranger will be sad, and look to the rolling sea:—the children will say, <Q REND="inline">"We see a ship; perhaps it is the king of Balclutha."</Q> The tear starts from their mother's eye. Her thoughts are of him that sleeps in Morven.</P>
<P>SUCH were the words of the king, when Ullin came to the mighty Carthon: he threw down the spear before him; and raised the song of peace.</P>
<P>COME to the feast of Fingal, Carthon, from the rolling sea! par∣take the feast of the king, or lift the spear of war. The ghosts of our foes are many: but renowned are the friends of Morven!</P>
<P>BEHOLD that field, O Carthon; many a green hill rises there, with mossy stones and rustling grass: these are the tombs of Fingal's foes, the sons of the rolling sea.</P>
<P>DOST thou speak to the feeble in arms, said Carthon, bard of the woody Morven? Is my face pale for fear, son of the peaceful song? Why, then, dost thou think to darken my soul with the tales of those who fell?—My arm has fought in the battle; my re∣nown is known afar. Go to the feeble in arms, and bid them yield to Fingal.—Have not I seen the fallen Balclutha? And shall I feast with Comhal's son? Comhal! who threw his fire in the midst of my fa∣ther's hall! I was young, and knew not the cause why the virgins wept. The columns of smoke pleased mine eye, when they rose above my walls; I often looked back, with gladness, when my friends
<PB N="136" REF="164"/>
fled along the hill.—But when the years of my youth came on, I beheld the moss of my fallen walls: my sigh arose with the morn∣ing, and my tears descended with night.—Shall I not fight, I said to my soul, against the children of my foes? And I will fight, O bard; I feel the strength of my soul.</P>
<P>HIS people gathered around the hero, and drew, at once, their shining swords. He stands, in the midst, like a pillar of fire; the tear half-starting from his eye; for he thought of the fallen Balclu∣tha, and the crowded pride of his soul arose. Sidelong he looked up to the hill, where our heroes shone in arms; the spear trembled in his hand: and, bending foreward, he seemed to threaten the king.</P>
<P>SHALL I, said Fingal to his soul, meet, at once, the king? Shall I stop him, in the midst of his course, before his fame shall arise? But the bard, hereafter, may say, when he sees the tomb of Car∣thon; Fingal took his thousands, along with him, to battle, before the noble Carthon fell.—No:—bard of the times to come! thou shalt not lessen Fingal's fame. My heroes will fight the youth, and Fingal behold the battle. If he overcomes, I rush, in my strength, like the roaring stream of Cona.</P>
<P>WHO, of my heroes, will meet the son of the rolling sea? Many are his warriors on the coast: and strong is his ashen spear!</P>

Feeble was his arm against Carthon, he fell; and his heroes fled.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="165"/>
CONNAL<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Connal is very much celebrated, in ancient poetry, for his wisdom and va∣lour: there is a small tribe still subsisting, in the North, who pretend they are de∣scended from him.</NOTE> resumed the battle, but he broke his heavy spear: he lay bound on the field: and Carthon pursued his people.</P>
<P>CLESSAMMOR! said the king<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Fingal did not then know that Car∣thon was the son of Clessammor.</NOTE> of Morven, where is the spear of thy strength? Wilt thou behold Connal bound; thy friend, at the stream of Lora? Rise, in the light of thy steel, thou friend of Comhal. Let the youth of Balclutha feel the strength of Mor∣ven's race.</P>
<P>HE rose in the strength of his steel, shaking his grizly locks. He fitted the shield to his side; and rushed, in the pride of valour.</P>
<P>CARTHON stood, on that heathy rock, and saw the heroes ap∣proach. He loved the terrible joy of his face: and his strength, in the locks of age.—Shall I lift that spear, he said, that never strikes, but once, a foe? Or shall I, with the words of peace, pre∣serve the warrior's life? Stately are his steps of age!—lovely the remnant of his years. Perhaps it is the love of Moina; the father of car-borne Carthon. Often have I heard, that he dwelt at the ecchoing stream of Lora.</P>
<P>SUCH were his words, when Clessámmor came, and lifted high his spear. The youth received it on his shield, and spoke the words of peace.—Warrior of the aged locks! Is there no youth to lift the spear? Hast thou no son, to raise the shield before his father, and to meet the arm of youth? Is the spouse of thy love no more? or weeps she over the tombs of thy sons? Art thou of the kings of men? What will be the fame of my sword if thou shalt fall?</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="166"/>
IT will be great, thou son of pride! begun the tall Clessámmor. I have been renowned in battle; but I never told my name<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To tell one's name to an enemy was reckoned, in those days of heroism, a ma∣nifest evasion of fighting him; for, if it was once known, that friendship subsisted, of old, between the ancestors of the com∣batants, the battle immediately ceased; and the ancient amity of their forefathers was renewed. <HI>A man who tells his name to his enemy,</HI> was of old an ignominious term for a coward.</NOTE> to a soe. Yield to me, son of the wave, and then thou shalt know, that the mark of my sword is in many a field.</P>
<P>I NEVER yielded, king of spears! replied the noble pride of Car∣thon: I have also fought in battles; and I behold my future fame. Despise me not, thou chief of men; my arm, my spear is strong. Retire among thy friends, and let young heroes fight.</P>
<P>WHY dost thou wound my soul, replied Clessámmor with a tear? Age does not tremble on my hand; I still can lift the sword. Shall I fly in Fingal's sight; in the sight of him I loved? Son of the sea! I never fled: exalt thy pointed spear.</P>
<P>THEY fought, like two contending winds, that strive to roll the wave. Carthon bade his spear to err; for he still thought that the foe was the spouse of Moina.—He broke Clessámmor's beamy spear in twain: and seized his shining sword. But as Carthon was binding the chief; the chief drew the dagger of his fathers. He saw the foe's uncovered side; and opened, there, a wound.</P>
<P>FINGAL saw Clessámmor low: he moved in the sound of his steel. The host stood silent, in his presence; they turned their eyes towards the hero.—He came, like the sullen noise of a storm, before the winds arise: the hunter hears it in the vale, and retires to the cave of the rock.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="167"/>
CARTHON stood in his place: the blood is rushing down his side: he saw the coming down of the king; and his hopes of fame arose<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This expression admits of a double meaning, either that Carthon hoped to ac∣quire glory by killing Fingal; or to be ren∣dered famous by falling by his hand. The last is the most probable, as Carthon is al∣ready wounded.</NOTE>; but pale was his cheek: his hair flew loose, his hel∣met shook on high: the force of Carthon failed; but his soul was strong.</P>
<P>FINGAL beheld the heroe's blood; he stopt the uplifted spear. Yield, king of swords! said Comhal's son; I behold thy blood. Thou hast been mighty in battle; and thy fame shall never fade.</P>
<P>ART thou the king so far renowned, replied the car-borne Car∣thon? Art thou that light of death, that frightens the kings of the world?—But why should Carthon ask? for he is like the stream of his desart; strong as a river, in his course: swift as the eagle of the sky.—O that I had sought with the king; that my same might be great in the song! that the hunter, beholding my tomb, might say, he fought with the mighty Fingal. But Carthon dies unknown; he has poured out his force on the feeble.</P>
<P>BUT thou shalt not die unknown, replied the king of woody Mor∣ven: my bards are many, O Carthon, and their songs descend to future times. The children of the years to come shall hear the fame of Carthon; when they sit round the burning oak<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In the north of Scotland, till very lately, they burnt a large trunk of an oak at their festivals; it was called <HI>the trunk of the feast.</HI> Time had, so much, consecrated the custom, that the vulgar thought it a kind of sacrilege to disuse it.</NOTE>, and the night is spent in the songs of old.

where the mighty fought; <Q REND="inline">"There the king of Balclutha fought, like the strength of a thousand streams."</Q></P>
<P>JOY rose in Carthon's face: he lifted his heavy eyes.—He gave his sword to Fingal, to lie within his hall, that the memory of Balclutha's king might remain on Morven.—The battle ceased along the field, for the bard had sung the song of peace. The chiefs ga∣thered round the falling Carthon, and heard his words, with sighs. Silent they leaned on their spears, while Balclutha's hero spoke. His hair sighed in the wind, and his words were feeble.</P>
<P>KING of Morven, Carthon said, I fall in the midst of my course. A foreign tomb receives, in youth, the last of Reuthámir's race. Darkness dwells in Balclutha: and the shadows of grief in Crathmo.—But raise my remembrance on the banks of Lora: where my fa∣thers dwelt. Perhaps the husband of Moina will mourn over his fallen Carthon.</P>
<P>HIS words reached the heart of Clessámmor: he fell, in silence, on his son. The host stood darkened around: no voice is on the plains of Lora. Night came, and the moon, from the east, looked on the mournful field: but still they stood, like a silent grove that lifts its head on Gormal, when the loud winds are laid, and dark au∣tumn is on the plain.</P>
<P>THREE days they mourned above Carthon; on the fourth his fa∣ther died. In the narrow plain of the rock they lie; and a dim ghost defends their tomb. There lovely Moina is often seen; when the sun-beam darts on the rock, and all around is dark. There she is seen, Malvina, but not like the daughters of the hill. Her robes are from the stranger's land; and she is still alone.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="169"/>
FINGAL was sad for Carthon; he desired his bards to mark the day, when shadowy autumn returned. And often did they mark the day and sing the hero's praise. Who comes so dark from ocean's roar, like autumn's shadowy cloud? Death is trembling in his hand! his eyes are flames of fire!—Who roars along dark Lora's heath? Who but Carthon, king of swords? The people fall! see! how he strides, like the sullen ghost of Morven!—But there he lies a goodly oak, which sudden blasts overturned! When shalt thou rise, Balclutha's joy! lovely car-borne Carthon?—Who comes so dark from ocean's roar, like autumn's shadowy cloud?</P>
<P>SUCH were the words of the bards, in the day of their mourning: I have accompanied their voice; and added to their song. My soul has been mournful for Carthon; he fell in the days of his valour: and thou, O Clessámmor! where is thy dwelling in the air?—Has the youth forgot his wound? And flies he, on the clouds, with thee?—I feel the sun, O Malvina, leave me to my rest. Perhaps they may come to my dreams; I think I hear a feeble voice.—The beam of heaven delights to shine on the grave of Carthon: I feel it warm around.</P>

<HEAD>THE DEATH of CUCHULLIN: A POEM<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Tradition throws considerable light on the history of Ireland, during the long reign of Fingal, the son of Comhal, in Morven.—Arth, the son of Cairbre, supreme king of Ireland, dying, was succeeded by his son Cormac, a minor.—The petty kings and chiefs of the tribes met at Temora, the royal palace, in order to chuse, out of their own number, a guardian to the young king. Disputes, concerning the choice of a proper person, run high, and it was resolved to end all differences by giving the tuition of the young king to Cuchullin, the son of Semo, who had rendered himself famous by his great actions, and who resided, at the time, with Connal, the son of Caithbat, in Ulster.</P>
<P>Cuchullin was but three and twenty years old, when he assumed the management of affairs in Ireland: and the invasion of Swa∣ran happened two years after. In the twen∣ty-seventh year of Cuchullin's age, and the third of his administration, Torlath, the son of Cantéla, set up for himself in Con∣naught, and advanced towards Temora, in order to dethrone Cormac. Cuchullin marched against him, came up with him at the Lake of Lego, and totally defeated his forces. Torlath fell in the battle by Cuchullin's hand; but as he himself pressed too eagerly on the flying enemy, he was mortally wounded by an arrow, and died the second day after.</P>
<P>The good fortune of Cormac fell with Cuchullin: many set up for themselves, and anarchy and confusion reigned. At last Cormac was taken off, nobody knew how; and Cairbar, one of the competitors for the throne, having defeated all his ri∣vals, became sole monarch of Ireland.—The family of Fingal, who were in the in∣terest of Cormac's family, were resolved to deprive Cairbar of the throne he had usurped; in particular, Oscar the son of Offian had determined to revenge the death of Cathol, his friend, who had been assas∣sinated by Cairbar.—The threats of Oscar reached Cairbar's ears: he invited him in a friendly manner to a feast which he had prepared at the royal palace of Temora, resolving to pick a quarrel, and have some pretext for killing him.</P>
<P>The quarrel happened; the followers of both fought, and Cairbar and Oscar sell by mutual wounds: in the mean time Fingal arrived from Scotland with an army, de∣feated the friends of Cairbar, and re-esta∣blished the family of Cormac in the pos∣session of the kingdom.—The present poem concerns the death of Cuchullin. It is, in the original, called <HI>Duan loch Leigo, i. e. The Poem of Lego's Lake,</HI> and is an episode introduced in a great poem, which celebrated the last expedition of Fingal into Ireland. The greatest part of the poem is lost, and nothing remains but some epi∣sodes, which a few old people in the north of Scotland retain on memory.—Cuchul∣lin is the most famous Champion in the Irish traditions and poems; in them he is always called the <HI>redoubtable Cuchullin;</HI> and the fables concerning his strength and va∣lour are innumerable. Ossian thought his expedition against the Fir-bolg, or Belgae of Britain, a subject fit for an epic poem; which was extant till of late, and was called <HI>Tora-na-tana,</HI> or a <HI>Dispute about Pos∣sessions,</HI> as the war which was the founda∣tion of it, was commenced by the British Belgae, who inhabited Ireland, in order to extend their territories.—The fragments that remain of this poem are animated with the genuine spirit of Ossian; so that there can be do doubt that it was of his composition.</P></NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>IS the wind on Fingal's shield? Or is the voice of past times in my hall? Sing on, sweet voice, for thou art pleasant, and car∣riest away my night with joy. Sing on, O Bragela, daughter of Car-borne Songlan!</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="172"/>
IT is the white wave of the rock, and not Cuchullin's sails. Often do the mists deceive me for the ship of my love! when they rise round some ghost, and spread their gray skirts on the wind. Why dost thou delay thy coming, son of the generous Semo?—Four times has autumn returned with its winds, and raised the seas of Togorma<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Togorma, <HI>i. e. The island of blue waves,</HI> one of the Hebrides, was subject to Con∣nal, the son of Caithbat, Cuchullin's friend.—He is sometimes called the son of Colgar, from one of that name who was the founder of the family.—Connal, a few days be∣fore the news of Torlath's revolt came to Temora, had sailed to Togorma, his na∣tive isle; where he was detained by con∣trary winds during the war in which Cu∣chullin was killed.</NOTE>,

since thou hast been in the roar of battles, and Bragéla distant far.—Hills of the isle of mist! when will ye answer to his hounds?—But ye are dark in your clouds, and sad Bragéla calls in vain. Night comes rolling down: the face of ocean fails. The heath-cock's head is beneath his wing: the hind sleeps with the hart of the de∣sart. They shall rise with the morning's light, and feed on the mossy stream. But my tears return with the sun, my sighs come on with the night. When wilt thou come in thine arms, O chief of mossy Tura?</P>
<P>PLEASANT is thy voice in Ossian's ear, daughter of car-borne Sorglan! But retire to the hall of shells; to the beam of the burning oak.—Attend to the murmur of the sea: it rolls at Dunscaich's walls: let sleep descend on thy blue eyes, and the hero come to thy dreams.</P>
<P>CUCHULLIN sits at Lego's lake, at the dark rolling of wa∣ters. Night is around the hero; and his thousands spread on the heath: a hundred oaks burn in the midst, the feast of shells is smok∣ing wide.—Carril strikes the harp, beneath a tree; his gray locks glitter in the beam; the rustling blast of night is near, and lifts his aged hair.—His song is of the blue Togorma, and of its chief, Cu∣chullin's friend.</P>
<P>WHY art thou absent, Connal, in the day of the gloomy storm? The chiefs of the south have convened against the car-borne Cor∣mac: the winds detain thy sails, and thy blue waters roll around thee. But Cormac is not alone: the son of Semo fights his battles. Semo's son his battles fights! the terror of the stranger! he that is

<P>SUCH was the song of Carril, when a son of the foe appeared; he threw down his pointless spear, and spoke the words of Torlath: Torlath the chief of heroes, from Lego's sable surge: he that led his thousands to battle, against car-borne Cormac. Cormac who was distant far, in Temora's<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The royal palace of the Irish kings; Teamhrath according to some of the bards.</NOTE> ecchoing halls: he learned to bend the bow of his fathers; and to lift the spear. Nor long didst thou lift the spear, mildly-shining beam of youth! death stands dim be∣hind thee, like the darkened half of the moon behind its growing light.</P>
<P>CUCHULLIN rose before the bard<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The bards were the heralds of ancient times; and their persons were sacred on account of their office.

<P>HE comes to thy battle, replied the bard, to the sounding strife of spears.—When morning is gray on Lego, Torlath will fight
<PB N="147" REF="175"/>
on the plain: and wilt thou meet him, in thine arms, king of the isle of mist? Terrible is the spear of Torlath! it is a meteor of night. He lifts it, and the people fall: death sits in the lightning of his sword.</P>
<P>Do I fear, replied Cuchullin, the spear of car-borne Torlath? He is brave as a thousand heroes; but my soul delights in war. The sword rests not by the side of Cuchullin, bard of the times of old! Morning shall meet me on the plain, and gleam on the blue arms of Semo's son.—But sit thou, on the heath, O bard! and let us hear thy voice: partake of the joyful shell; and hear the songs of Temora.</P>
<P>THIS is no time, replied the bard, to hear the song of joy; when the mighty are to meet in battle like the strength of the waves of Lego. Why art thou so dark, Slimora<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sila'-mor, <HI>great bill.</HI></NOTE>! with all thy silent woods? No green star trembles on thy top; no moon-beam on thy side. But the meteors of death are there, and the gray watry forms of ghosts. Why art thou dark, Slimora! with thy silent woods?</P>
<P>HE retired, in the sound of his song; Carril accompanied his voice. The music was like the memory of joys that are past, plea∣sant and mournful to the soul. The ghosts of departed bards heard it from Slimora's side. Soft sounds spread along the wood, and the silent valleys of night rejoice.—So, when he sits in the silence of noon, in the valley of his breeze, the humming of the mountain bee comes to Ossian's ear: the gale drowns it often in its course; but the pleasant sound returns again.</P>
<P>RAISE, said Cuchullin, to his hundred bards, the song of the noble Fingal: that song which he hears at night, when the dreams
<PB N="148" REF="176"/>
of his rest descend: when the bards strike the distant harp, and the faint light gleams on Selma's walls. Or let the grief of Lara rise, and the sighs of the mother of Calmar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Calmar the son of Matha. His death is related at large, in the third book of Fin∣gal. He was the only son of Matha; and the family was extinct in him.—The seat of the family was on the banks of the river Lara, in the neighbourhood of Lego, and probably near the place where Cuchullin lay; which circumstance suggested to him, the lamentation of Alclétha over her son.</NOTE>, when he was sought, in vain, on his hills; and she beheld his bow in the hall.—Carril, place the shield of Caithbat on that branch; and let the spear of Cuchullin be near; that the sound of my battle may rise with the gray beam of the east.</P>
<P>THE hero leaned on his father's shield: the song of Lara rose. The hundred bards were distant far: Carril alone is near the chief. The words of the song were his; and the sound of his harp was mournful.</P>
<P>ALCLETHA<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ald-cla'tha, <HI>decaying beauty:</HI> probably a poetical name given the mother of Calmar, by the bard himself.</NOTE> with the aged locks! mother of car-borne Calmar! why dost thou look towards the desart, to behold the return of thy son?

<P>WHY dost thou look towards the desart, mother of car-borne Calmar?—</P>
<P>SUCH was the song of Carril, when Cuchullin lay on his shield: the bards rested on their harps, and sleep fell softly around.—The son of Semo was awake alone; his soul was fixed on the war.—The burning oaks began to decay; faint red light is spread around.—A feeble voice is heard: the ghost of Calmar came. He stalked in the beam. Dark is the wound in his side. His hair is disordered and loose. Joy sits darkly on his face; and he seems to invite Cuchullin to his cave.</P>

Thy hand was not feeble in war; neither was thy voice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Calmar's speech, in the first book of Fingal.</NOTE> for peace.

Retire thou to thy cave; thou art not Calmar's ghost; he delighted in battle, and his arm was like the thunder of heaven.</P>
<P>HE retired in his blast with joy, for he had heard the voice of his praise. The faint beam of the morning rose, and the sound of Caithbat's buckler spread. Green Ullin's warriors convened, like the roar of many streams.—The horn of war is heard over Lego; the mighty Torlath came.</P>
<P>Why dost thou come with thy thousands, Cuchullin, said the chief of Lego. I know the strength of thy arm, and thy soul is an un∣extinguished fire.—Why fight we not on the plain, and let our hosts behold our deeds? Let them behold us like roaring waves, that tumble round a rock: the mariners hasten away, and look on their strife with fear.</P>

<HEAD>DAR-THULA: A POEM<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It may not be improper here, to give the story which is the foundation of this poem, as it is handed down by tradition.—Usnoth lord of Etha, which is probably that part of Argyleshire which is near Loch Eta, an arm of the sea in Lorn, had three sons, Nathos, Althos, and Ardan by Slis-sáma, the daughter of Semo and sister to the celebrated Cuchullin. The three brothers, when very young, were sent over to Ireland, by their father, to learn the use of arms, un∣der their uncle Cuchullin, who made a great figure in that kingdom. They were just landed in Ulster when the news of Cu∣chullin's death arrived. Nathos, though very young, took the command of Cu∣chullin's army, made head against Cairbar the usurper, and defeated him in several battles. Cairbar at last having found means to murder Cormac the lawful king, the ar∣my of Nathos shifted sides, and he himself was obliged to return into Ulster, in order to pass over into Scotland.</P>
<P>Dar-thula, the daughter of Colla, with whom Cairbar was in love, resided, at that time, in Selama a castle in Ulster: she saw, fell in love, and fled with Nathos; but a storm rising at sea, they were unfortunately driven back on that part of the coast of Ul∣ster, where Cairbar was encamped with his army. The three brothers, after having de∣fended themselves, for some time, with great bravery, were overpowered and slain, and the unfortunate Dar-thula killed herself up∣on the body of her beloved Nathos.</P>
<P>Ossian opens the poem, on the night pre∣ceding the death of the sons of Usnoth, and brings in, by way of episode, what passed before. He relates the death of Dar-thula differently from the common tradition; his account is the most probable, as suicide seems to have been unknown in those early times: for no traces of it are found in the old poetry.</P></NOTE>.</HEAD>

Ullin stretches its green head into the sea; and Tura's bay receives the ship. Where have ye been, ye southern winds! when the sons of my love were deceived? But ye have been sporting on plains, and pursuing the thistle's beard.

<P>BUT the land of strangers saw thee, lovely: thou wast lovely in the eyes of Dar-thula. Thy face was like the light of the morning, thy hair like the raven's wing. Thy soul was generous and mild, like the hour of the setting sun. Thy words were the gale of the reeds, or the gliding stream of Lora.</P>
<P>BUT when the rage of battle rose, thou wast like a sea in a storm; the clang of thy arms was terrible: the host vanished at the sound of thy course.—It was then Dar-thula beheld thee, from the top of her mossy tower: from the tower of Seláma<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The poet does not mean that Seláma which is mentioned as the seat of Toscar in Ulster, in the poem of Conlath and Cu-thona.

LOVEly art thou, O stranger! she said, for her trembling soul arose.

<P>SUCH were thy words, Dar-thula, in Seláma's mossy towers. But, now, the night is round thee: and the winds have deceived thy sails. The winds have deceived thy sails, Dar-thula: their bluster∣ing sound is high. Cease a little while, O north wind, and let me hear the voice of the lovely. Thy voice is lovely, Dar-thula, be∣tween the rustling blasts.</P>
<P>ARE these the rocks of Nathos, and the roar of his mountain-streams? Comes that beam of light from Usnoth's nightly hall? The mist rolls around, and the beam is feeble: but the light of Dar-thula's soul is the car-borne chief of Etha! Son of the generous Us∣noth, why that broken sigh? Are we not in the land of strangers, chief of echoing Etha?</P>
<P>THESE are not the rocks of Nathos, he replied, nor the roar of his streams. No light comes from Etha's halls, for they are

distant sar. We are in the land of strangers, in the land of car-borne Cairbar. The winds have deceived us, Dar-thula. Ullin lifts here her green hills.—Go towards the north, Althos; be thy steps, Ardan, along the coast; that the foe may not come in darkness, and our hopes of Etha fail.—</P>
<P>I WILL go towards that mossy tower, and see who dwells about the beam.—Rest, Dar-thula, on the shore! rest in peace, thou beam of light! the sword of Nathos is around thee, like the lightning of heaven.</P>
<P>HE went. She sat alone, and heard the rolling of the wave. The big tear is in her eye; and she looked for the car-borne Nathos.—Her soul trembles at the blast. And she turns her ear towards the tread of his feet.—The tread of his feet is not heard. Where art thou, son of my love! The roar of the blast is around me. Dark is the cloudy night.—But Nathos does not return. What detains thee, chief of Etha?—Have the foes met the hero in the strife of the night?—</P>
<P>HE returned, but his face was dark: he had seen his departed friend.—It was the wall of Tura, and the ghost of Cuchullin stalked there. The sighing of his breast was frequent; and the decayed flame of his eyes terrible. His spear was a column of mist: the stars looked dim through his form. His voice was like hollow wind in a cave: and he told the tale of grief.

<BIBL>HOM. vi. 411.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>, but Nathos? My father rests in the tomb. Silence dwells on Seláma: sadness spreads on the blue streams of my land. My friends have fallen, with Cormac. The mighty were slain in the battle of Ullin.</P>
<P>EVENING darkened on the plain. The blue streams failed before mine eyes. The unfrequent blast came rustling in the tops of Seláma's groves. My feat was beneath a tree on the walls of my fathers. Truthil past before my soul; the brother of my love; he that was absent<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The family of Colla preserved their loyalty to Cormac long after the death of Cuchullin.</NOTE> in battle against the car-borne Cairbar.</P>
<P>BENDING on his spear, the gray-haired Colla came: his down-cast face is dark, and sorrow dwells in his soul. His sword is on the side of the hero: the helmet of his fathers on his head.—The battle grows in his breast. He strives to hide the tear.</P>
<P>DAR-THULA, he sighing said, thou art the last of Colla's race. Truthil is fallen in battle. The king<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is very common, in Ossian's poetry, to give the title of King to every chief that was remarkable for his valour.</NOTE> of Seláma is no more.—Cairbar comes, with his thousands, towards Seláma's walls.—Colla will meet his pride, and revenge his son. But where shall I find thy safety, Dar-thula with the dark-brown hair! thou art lovely as the sun-beam of heaven, and thy friends are low!</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="189"/>
AND is the son of battle fallen, I said with a bursting sigh? Ceased the generous soul of Truthil to lighten through the field?—My safety, Colla, is in that bow; I have learned to pierce the deer. Is not Cairbar like the hart of the desart, father of fallen Truthil?</P>
<P>THE face of age brightened with joy: and the crouded tears of his eyes poured down. The lips of Colla trembled. His gray beard whistled in the blast. Thou art the sister of Truthil, he said, and thou burnest in the fire of his soul. Take, Dar-thula, take that spear, that brazen shield, that burnished helmet: they are the spoils of a warrior: a son<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The poet, to make the story of Dar-thula's arming herself for battle, more pro∣bable, makes her armour to be that of a very young man, otherwise it would shock all belief, that she, who was very young, should be able to carry it.</NOTE> of early youth.—When the light rises on Seláma, we go to meet the car-borne Cairbar.—But keep thou near the arm of Colla; beneath the shadow of my shield. Thy father, Darthula, could once defend thee; but age is trembling on his hand.—The strength of his arm has failed, and his soul is darkened with grief.</P>
<P>We passed the night in sorrow. The light of morning rose. I shone in the arms of battle. The gray-haired hero moved be∣fore. The sons of Seláma convened around the sounding shield of Colla. But few were they in the plain, and their locks were gray. The youths had fallen with Truthil, in the battle of car-borne Cormac.</P>
<P>COMPANIONS of my youth! said Colla, it was not thus you have seen me in arms. It was not thus I strode to battle, when the great Confadan fell. But ye are laden with grief. The darkness
<PB N="162" REF="190"/>
of age comes like the mist of the desart. My shield is worn with years; my sword is fixed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was the custom of those times, that every warrior at a certain age, or when he became unfit for the field, fixed his arms, in the great hall, where the tribe feasted, upon joyful occasions.

I said to my soul, thy evening shall be calm, and thy departure like a fading light. But the storm has returned; I bend like an aged oak. My boughs are fallen on Seláma, and I tremble in my place.—Where art thou, with thy fallen heroes, O my car-borne Truthil! Thou answerest not from thy rushing blast; and the soul of thy father is sad. But I will be sad no more, Cairbar or Colla must fall. I feel the re∣turning strength of my arm. My heart leaps at the sound of battle.</P>
<P>THE hero drew his sword. The gleaming blades of his people rose. They moved along the plain. Their gray hair streamed in the wind.—Cairbar sat, at the feast, in the silent plain of Lona<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lona, <HI>a marshy plain.</HI> It was the cu∣stom, in the days of Ossian, to feast after a victory.

I have seen thee, in the midst of thousands, like the beam of hea∣ven's fire; it is beautiful, but terrible; the people fall in its red course.—The spear of Colla slew, for he remembered the battles of his youth. An arrow came with its sound, and pierced the he∣ro's side. He fell on his ecchoing shield. My soul started with
<PB N="163" REF="191"/>
fear; I stretched my buckler over him; but my heaving breast was seen. Cairbar came, with his spear, and he beheld Seláma's maid: joy rose on his dark-brown face; he stayed the lifted steel. He rais∣ed the tomb of Colla; and brought me weeping to Seláma. He spoke the words of love, but my soul was sad. I saw the shields of my fathers, and the sword of car-borne Truthil. I saw the arms of the dead, and the tear was on my cheek.</P>
<P>THEN thou didst come, O Nathos: and gloomy Cairbar fled. He fled like the ghost of the desart before the morning's beam. His hosts were not near: and feeble was his arm against thy steel.</P>
<P>WHY<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is usual with Ossian, to repeat, at the end of the episodes, the sentence which in∣troduced them. It brings back the mind of the reader to the main story of the poem.</NOTE> art thou sad, O Nathos! said the lovely maid of Colla?</P>
<P>I HAVE met, replied the hero, the battle in my youth. My arm could not lift the spear, when first the danger rose; but my soul brightened before the war, as the green narrow vale, when the sun pours his streamy beams, before he hides his head in a storm. My soul brightened in danger before I saw Seláma's fair; before I saw thee, like a star, that shines on the hill, at night; the cloud slowly comes, and threatens the lovely light.</P>
<P>WE are in the land of the foe, and the winds have deceived us, Dar-thula! the strength of our friends is not near, nor the moun∣tains of Etha. Where shall I find thy peace, daughter of mighty Colla! The brothers of Nathos are brave: and his own sword has shone in war. But what are the sons of Usnoth to the host of car-borne Cairbar! O that the winds had brought thy sails, Oscar<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Oscar, the son of Ossian, had long re∣solved on the expedition, into Ireland, a∣gainst Cairbar, who had assassinated his friend Cathol, the son of Moran, an Irish∣man of noble extraction, and in the interest of the family of Cormac.</NOTE> king
<PB N="164" REF="192"/>
of men! thou didst promise to come to the battles of fallen Cormac. Then would my hand be strong as the flaming arm of death. Cair∣bar would tremble in his halls, and peace dwell round the lovely Dar-thula. But why dost thou fall, my soul? The sons of Usnoth may prevail.</P>
<P>AND they will prevail, O Nathos, said the rising soul of the maid: never shall Dar-thula behold the halls of gloomy Cairbar. Give me those arms of brass, that glitter to that passing meteor; I see them in the dark-bosomed ship. Dar-thula will enter the battle of steel.—Ghost of the noble Colla! do I behold thee on that cloud? Who is that dim beside thee? It is the car-borne Truthil. Shall I behold the halls of him that slew Seláma's chief! No: I will not behold them, spirits of my love!</P>
<P>JOY rose in the face of Nathos, when he heard the white bosomed maid. Daughter of Seláma! thou shinest on my soul. Come, with thy thousands, Cairbar! the strength of Nathos is returned. And thou, O aged Usnoth, shalt not hear that thy son has fled. I remember thy words on Etha; when my sails begun to rise: when I spread them towards Ullin, towards the mossy walls of Tura. Thou goest, he said, O Nathos, to the king of shields; to Cuchullin chief of men who never fled from danger. Let not thine arm be feeble: neither be thy thoughts of flight; lest the son of Semo say that Etha's race are weak. His words may come to Usnoth, and sadden his soul in the hall.—The tear is on his cheek. He gave this shin∣ing sword.</P>
<P>I came to Tura's bay: but the halls of Tura were silent; I looked around, and there was none to tell of the chief of Dunscaich. I
<PB N="165" REF="193"/>
went to the hall of his shells, where the arms of his fathers hung. But the arms were gone, and aged Lamhor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lamh-mhor, <HI>mighty hand.</HI></NOTE> sat in tears.</P>
<P>WHENCE are the arms of steel, said the rising Lamhor? The light of the spear has long been absent from Tura's dusky walls.—Come ye from the rolling sea? Or from Temora's<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Temora was the royal palace of the supreme kings of Ireland. It is here called mournful, on account of the death of Cor∣mac, who was murdered there by Cairbar who usurped his throne.</NOTE> mournful halls?</P>
<P>WE come from the sea, I said, from Usnoth's rising towers. We are the sons of Slis-sáma<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Slis-seamha, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t bosom.</HI> She was the wise of Usnoth and daughter of Semo the chief of the <HI>isle of mist.</HI></NOTE>, the daughter of car-borne Semo. Where is Tura's chief, son of the silent hall? But why should Nathos ask? for I behold thy tears. How did the mighty fall, son of the lonely Tura?</P>
<P>HE fell not, Lamhor replied, like the silent star of night, when it shoots through darkness and is no more. But he was like a me∣teor that salls in a distant land; death attends its green course, and itself is the sign of wars.—Mournful are the banks of Lego, and the roar of streamy Lara! There the hero fell, son of the noble Usnoth.</P>
<P>AND the hero fell in the midst of slaughter, I said with a bursting sigh. His hand was strong in battle; and death was behind his sword.—We came to Lego's mournful banks. We found his rising tomb. His conpanions in battle are there; his bards of many songs. Three days we mourned over the hero: on the fourth, I struck the shield of Caithbat. The heroes gathered around with joy, and shook their beamy spears.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="194"/>
CORLATH was near with his host, the friend of car-borne Cair∣bar. We came like a stream by night, and his heroes fell. When the people of the valley rose<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the Lord went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians, an hundred fourscore and five thousand: and when they rose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead men. <BIBL>2 KINGS xix. 35.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>, they saw their blood with morning's light. But we rolled away, like wreaths of mist, to Cormac's ec∣choing hall. Our swords rose to defend the king. But Temora's halls were empty. Cormac had fallen in his youth. The king of Erin was no more.</P>
<P>SADNESS seized the sons of Ullin, they slowly, gloomily retired: like clouds that, long having threatened rain, retire behind the hills. The sons of Usnoth moved, in their grief, towards Tura's sounding bay. We passed by Seláma, and Cairbar retired like Lano's mist, when it is driven by the winds of the desart.</P>

<P>AND let them lift ten thousand swords, said Nathos with a smile. The sons of car-borne Usnoth will never tremble in danger. Why dost thou roll with all thy foam, thou roaring sea of Ullin?

<P>HE brought the arms. Nathos clothed his limbs in all their shining steel. The stride of the chief is lovely: the joy of his eyes terrible. He looks towards the coming of Cairbar. The wind is rustling in his hair. Dar-thula is silent at his side: her look is fixed on the chief. She strives to hide the rising sigh, and two tears swell in her eyes.</P>
<P>ALTHOS! said the chief of Etha, I see a cave in that rock. Place Dar-thula there: and let thy arm be strong. Ardan! we meet the foe, and call to battle gloomy Cairbar. O that he came in his sounding steel, to meet the son of Usnoth!—Darthula! if thou shalt escape, look not on the fallen Nathos. Lift thy sails, O Al∣thos, towards the ecchoing groves of Etha.</P>

TELL to the chief<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Usnoth.</NOTE>, that his son fell with fame; that my sword did not shun the battle.

<P>AND my voice shall praise thee, Nathos chief of the woody Etha! The voice of Ossian shall rise in thy praise, son of the generous Us∣noth! Why was I not on Lena, when the battle rose? Then would the sword of Ossian defend thee; or himself fall low.</P>
<P>WE sat, that night, in Selma round the strength of the shell. The wind was abroad, in the oaks; the spirit of the mountain<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">By the spirit of the mountain is meant that deep and melancholy sound which precedes a storm; well known to those who live in a high country.</NOTE> shrieked. The blast came rustling through the hall, and gently touched my harp. The sound was mournful and low, like the song of the tomb. Fingal heard it first, and the crouded sighs of his bosom rose.—Some of my heroes are low, said the gray-haired king of Morven. I hear the sound of death on the harp of my son. Ossian, touch the sounding string; bid the sorrow rise; that their spirits may fly with joy to Morven's woody hills.</P>
<P>I TOUCHED the harp before the king, the sound was mournful and low. Bend forward from your clouds, I said, ghosts of my fa∣thers! bend; lay by the red terror of your course, and receive the falling chief; whether he comes from a distant land, or rises from the rolling sea. Let his robe of mist be near; his spear that is

formed of a cloud. Place an half-extinguished meteor by his side, in the form of the hero's sword. And, oh! let his countenance be lovely, that his friends may delight in his presence. Bend from your clouds, I said, ghosts of my fathers! bend.</P>
<P>SUCH was my song, in Selma, to the lightly-trembling harp. But Nathos was on Ullin's shore, surrounded by the night; he heard the voice of the foe amidst the roar of tumbling waves. Silent he heard their voice, and rested on his spear.</P>
<P>MORNING rose, with its beams; the sons of Erin appear; like gray rocks, with all their trees, they spread along the coast. Cair∣bar stood, in the midst, and grimly smiled when he saw the foe.</P>
<P>NATHOS rushed forward, in his strength; nor could Dar-thula stay behind. She came with the hero, lifting her shining spear. And who are these, in their armour, in the pride of youth? Who but the sons of Usnoth, Althos and dark-haired Ardan?</P>
<P>COME, said Nathos, come! chief of the high Temora! Let our battle be on the coast for the white-bosomed maid. His people are not with Nathos; they are behind that rolling sea. Why dost thou bring thy thousands against the chief of Etha? Thou didst fly<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He alludes to the flight of Cairbar from Seláma.</NOTE> from him, in battle, when his friends were around him.</P>
<P>YOUTH of the heart of pride, shall Erin's king fight with thee? Thy fathers were not among the renowned, nor of the kings of men. Are the arms of soes in their halls? Or the shields of other times? Cairbar is renowned in Temora, nor does he fight with little men.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="198"/>
THE tear starts from car-borne Nathos; he turned his eyes to his brothers. Their spears flew, at once, and three heroes lay on earth. Then the light of their swords gleamed on high; the ranks of Erin yield; as a ridge of dark clouds before a blast of wind.</P>
<P>THEN Cairbar ordered his people, and they drew a thousand bows. A thousand arrows flew; the sons of Usnoth fell. They fell like three young oaks which stood alone on the hill; the tra∣veller saw the lovely trees and wondered how they grew so lonely; the blast of the desart came, by night, and laid their green heads low; next day he returned but they were withered, and the heath was bare.</P>
<P>DAR-THULA stood in silent grief, and beheld their fall; no tear is in her eye: but her look is wildly sad. Pale was her cheek; her trembling lips broke short an half-formed word. Her dark hair flew on the wind.—But gloomy Cairbar came. Where is thy lover now? the car-borne chief of Etha? Hast thou beheld the halls of Usnoth? Or the dark-brown hills of Fingal? My battle had roared on Morven, did not the winds meet Dar-thula. Fingal himself would have been low and sorrow dwelling in Selma.</P>
<P>HER shield fell from Dar-thula's arm, her breast of snow appear∣ed. It appeared, but it was stained with blood for an arrow was fixed in her side. She fell on the fallen Nathos, like a wreath of snow. Her dark hair spreads on his face, and their blood is mixing round.</P>

<HEAD>TEMORA: AN EPIC POEM<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Though the history which is the foun∣dation of the present poem, was given in the notes on the two pieces preceding, it may not be here improper to recapitulate some part of what has been said.—Imme∣diately after the death of Cuchullin, Cair∣bar, lord of Atha, openly set up for him∣self in Connaught, and having privately murdered young king Cormac, became, without opposition, sole monarch of Ire∣land. The murder of Cormac was so much resented by Fingal, that he resolved on an expedition into Ireland against Cair∣bar. Early intelligence of his designs came to Cairbar, and he had gathered the tribes together into Ulster, to oppose Fingal's landing; at the same time his brother Cathmor kept himself with an army near Temora.—This Cathmor is one of the finest characters in the old poetry. His humanity, generosity, and hospitality, were unparallelled: in short, he had no fault, but too much attachment to so bad a brother as Cairbar.—The present poem has its name from Temora, the royal palace of the Irish kings, near which the last and de∣cisive battle was fought between Fingal and Cathmor. What has come to the translator's hands, in a regular connection, is little more than the opening of the poem.—This work appears, from the story of it, which is still preserv'd, to have been one of the greatest of Ossian's compositions. The variety of the characters makes it in∣teresting; and the war, as it is carried on by Fingal and Cathmor, affords instances of the greatest bravery, mixed with incom∣parably generous actions and sentiments. One is at a loss for which side to declare himself: and often wishes, when both commanders march to battle, that both may return victorious. At length the good fortune of Fingal preponderates, and the family of Cormac are re-established on the Irish throne.</P>
<P>The Irish traditions relate the affair in another light, and exclaim against Fingal for appointing thirty judges, or rather ty∣rants, at Temora, for regulating the affairs of Ireland. They pretend to enumerate many acts of oppression committed by those judges; and affirm, that both they and a part of Fingal's army, which was left in Ireland to enforce their laws, were at last expelled the kingdom.—Thus the Irish tra∣ditions, say the historians of that nation. It is said, however, that those gentlemen sometimes create facts, in order afterwards to make remarks upon them; at least, that they adopt for real facts, the traditions of their bards, when they throw lustre on the ancient state of their country.</P>
<P>The present poem opens in the morning. Cairbar is represented as retired from the rest of the Irish chiefs, and tormented with remorse for the murder of Cormac, when news was brought him of Fingal's landing. What passed, preceding that day, and is necessary to be known for carrying on the poem, is afterwards introduced by way of episode.</P></NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>THE blue waves of Ullin roll in light. The green hills are covered with day. Trees shake their dusky heads in the breeze; and gray torrents pour their noisy streams.—Two green hills, with their aged oaks, surround a narrow plain. The blue
<PB N="173" REF="201"/>
course of the mountain-stream is there; Cairbar stands on its banks.—His spear supports the king: the red eyes of his fear are sad. Cormac rises in his soul, with all his ghastly wounds. The gray form of the youth appears in the midst of darkness, and the blood pours from his airy sides.—Cairbar thrice threw his spear on earth; and thrice he stroked his beard. His steps are short; he often stopt: and tossed his sinewy arms. He is like a cloud in the desart; that varies its form to every blast: the valleys are sad around, and fear, by turns, the shower.</P>
<P>THE king, at length, resumed his soul, and took his pointed spear. He turned his eyes towards Lena<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The scene described here is nearly that of the epic poem, Fingal. In this neighbourhood also the sons of Usnoth were killed.</NOTE>. The scouts of ocean appear. They appeared with steps of fear, and often looked behind.
<PB N="174" REF="202"/>
Cairbar knew that the mighty were near, and called his gloomy chiefs. The sounding steps of his heroes came. They drew, at once, their swords. There Morlath<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mór-lath, <HI>great in the day of battle.</HI> Hidalla', <HI>wildly looking hero.</HI> Cor-mar, <HI>ex∣pert at sea.</HI> Málth-os, <HI>slow to speak.</HI> Fol∣dath, <HI>generous.</HI></NOTE> stood with darkened face. Hidalla's bushy hair sighs in the wind. Red-haired Cormar bends on his spear, and rolls his side-long-looking eyes. Wild is the look of Malthos from beneath two shaggy brows.—Foldath stands like an oozy rock, that covers its dark sides with foam; his spear is like Slimora's fir, that meets the wind of heaven. His shield is marked with the strokes of battle; and his red eye despises danger. These and a thousand other chiefs surrounded car-borne Cairbar, when the scout of ocean came, Mor-annal<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mór-annail, <HI>strong breath;</HI> a very pro∣per name for a scout.</NOTE>, from streamy Lena.—His eyes hang forward from his face, his lips are trembling, pale.</P>
<P>Do the chiefs of Erin stand, he said, silent as the grove of even∣ing? Stand they, like a silent wood, and Fingal on the coast? Fingal, who is terrible in battle, the king of streamy Morven.</P>
<P>AND hast thou seen the warrior, said Cairbar with a sigh? Are his heroes many on the coast? Lifts he the spear of battle? Or comes the king in peace?</P>
<P>HE comes not in peace, O Cairbar: for I have seen his forward spear<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mor-annal here alludes to the parti∣cular appearance of Fingal's spear.—If a man, upon his first landing in a strange country, kept the point of his spear for∣ward, it denoted in those days that he came in a hostile manner, and accordingly he was treated as an enemy; if he kept the point behind him, it was a token of friend∣ship, and he was immediately invited to the feast, according to the hospitality of the times.</NOTE> It is a meteor of death: the blood of thousands is on its
<PB N="175" REF="203"/>
steel.—He came first to the shore, strong in the gray hair of age. Full rose his sinewy limbs, as he strode in his might. That sword is by his side which gives no second<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This was the famous sword of Fingal, made by Luno, a smith of Lochlin, and after him poetically called the <HI>son of Luno:</HI> it is said of this sword, that it killed a man at every stroke; and that Fingal never used it, but in times of the greatest danger.</NOTE> wound. His shield is terrible, like the bloody moon, when it rises in a storm.—Then came Ossian king of songs; and Morni's son, the first of men. Connal leaps forward on his spear: Dermid spreads his dark-brown locks.—Fillan bends his bow: Fergus strides in the pride of youth. Who is that with aged locks? A dark shield is on his side. His spear trembles at every step; and age is on his limbs. He bends his dark face to the ground; the king of spears is sad!—It is Usnoth, O Cairbar, coming to revenge his sons. He sees green Ullin with tears, and he remembers the tombs of his children. But far before the rest, the son of Ossian comes, bright in the smiles of youth, fair as the first beams of the sun. His long hair falls on his back.—His dark brows are half hid beneath his helmet of steel. His sword hangs loose on the heroe's side. His spear glitters as he moves. I fled from his terrible eyes, king of high Temora!</P>
<P>THEN fly, thou feeble man, said the gloomy wrath of Foldath: fly to the gray streams of thy land, son of the little soul! Have not I seen that Oscar? I beheld the chief in battle. He is of the mighty in danger: but there are others who lift the spear.—Erin has many sons as brave: yes—more brave, O car-borne Cairbar!—Let Foldath meet him in the strength of his course, and stop this mighty stream.—My spear is covered with the blood of the valiant; my shield is like Tura's wall.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="204"/>
SHALL Foldath alone meet the foe, replied the dark-browed Malthos? Are not they numerous on our coast, like the waters of a thousand streams? Are not these the chiefs who vanquished Swaran, when the sons of Erin fled? And shall Foldath meet their bravest hero? Foldath of the heart of pride! take the strength of the people by thy side; and let Malthos come. My sword is red with slaughter, but who has heard my words<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That is, who has heard my vaunting? He intended the expression as a rebuke to the self-praise of Foldath.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>SONS of green Erin, begun the mild Hidalla, let not Fingal hear your words: lest the foe rejoice, and his arm be strong in the land.—Ye are brave, O warriors, and like the tempests of the desart; they meet the rocks without fear, and overturn the woods in their course.—But let us move in our strength, and slow as a gathered cloud, when the winds drive it from behind.—Then shall the mighty tremble, and the spear drop from the hand of the valiant.—We see the cloud of death, they will say; and their faces will turn pale. Fingal will mourn in his age; and say that his fame is ceased.—Morven will behold his chiefs no more: the moss of years shall grow in Selma.</P>
<P>CAIRBAR heard their words, in silence, like the cloud of a shower: it stands dark on Cromla, till the lightning bursts its side: the valley gleams with red light; the spirits of the storm rejoice.—So stood the silent king of Temora; at length his words are heard.</P>
<P>SPREAD the feast on Lena: and let my hundred bards attend. And thou, red-hair'd Olla, take the harp of the king. Go to Oscar king of swords, and bid him to our feast. To-day we feast and
<PB N="177" REF="205"/>
hear the song; to-morrow break the spears. Tell him that I have raised the tomb of Cathol<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cathol the son of Maronnan, or Moran, was murdered by Cairbar, for his attachment to the family of Cormac. He had attended Oscar to the <HI>war of Inis-thona,</HI> where they contracted a great friendship for one an∣other. Oscar, immediately after the death of Cathol, had sent a formal challenge to Cairbar, which he prudently declined, but conceived a secret hatred against Oscar, and had beforehand contrived to kill him at the feast, to which he here invited him.</NOTE>; and that my bards have sung to his ghost.—Tell him that Cairbar has heard his fame at the stream of distant Carun<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">He alludes to the battle of Oscar against Caros, <HI>king of ships;</HI> who is supposed to be the same with Carausius the usurper.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CATHMOR<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Cath-mór, <HI>great in battle.</HI> Cairbar takes advantage of his brother's absence, to per∣petrate his ungenerous designs against Os∣car; for the noble spirit of Cathmor, had he been present, would not have permitted the laws of that hospitality, for which he was so renowned himself, to be violated. The brothers form a contrast: we do not detest the mean soul of Cairbar more, than we admire the disinterested and generous mind of Cathmor.</NOTE> is not here; the generous brother of Cairbar; he is not here with his thousands, and our arms are weak. Cathmor is a foe to strife at the feast: his soul is bright as the sun. But Cairbar shall fight with Oscar, chiefs of the high Temora! His words for Cathol were many; and the wrath of Cairbar burns. He shall fall on Lena: and my fame shall rise in blood.</P>
<P>THE faces of the heroes brightened. They spread over Lena's heath. The feast of shells is prepared. The songs of the bards arose.</P>
<P>WE heard<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Fingal's army heard the joy that was in Cairbar's camp. The character given of Cathmor is agreeable to the times. Some, through ostentation, were hospitable; and others fell naturally into a custom handed down from their ancestors. But what marks strongly the character of Cathmor, is his aversion to praise; for he is represented to dwell in a wood to avoid the thanks of his guests; which is still a higher degree of generosity than that of Axylus in Ho∣mer: for the poet does not say, but the good man might, at the head of his own table, have heard with pleasure the praise bestowed on him by the people he en∣tertained.

<PB N="178" REF="206"/>
brother of red-haired Cairbar. But their souls were not the same: for the light of heaven was in the bosom of Cathmor. His towers rose on the banks of Atha: seven paths led to his halls. Seven chiefs stood on those paths, and called the stranger to the feast! But Cath∣mor dwelt in the wood to avoid the voice of praise.</P>
<P>OLLA came with his songs. Oscar went to Cairbar's feast. Three hundred heroes attended the chief, and the clang of their arms is terrible. The gray dogs bounded on the heath, and their howling is frequent. Fingal saw the departure of the hero: the soul of the king was sad. He dreads the gloomy Cairbar: but who of the race of Trenmor seared the foe?</P>
<P>MY son lifted high the spear of Cormac: an hundred bards met him with songs. Cairbar concealed with smiles the death that was dark in his soul. The feast is spread, the shells resound: joy bright∣ens the face of the host. But it was like the parting beam of the sun, when he is to hide his red head, in a storm.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="207"/>
CAIRBAR rose in his arms; darkness gathers on his brow. The hundred harps ceased at once. The clang<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When a chief was determined to kill a man that was in his power already, it was usual to signify, that his death was intend∣ed, by the sound of a shield struck with the blunt end of a spear; at the same time that a bard at distance raised the <HI>death-song.</HI> A ceremony of another kind was long used in Scotland upon such occasions. Every body has heard that a bull's head was served up to Lord Douglas in the castle of Edin∣burgh, as a certain signal of his approaching death.</NOTE> of shields is heard. Far distant on the heath Olla raised his song of woe. My son knew the sign of death; and rising seized his spear.</P>
<P>OSCAR! said the dark-red Cairbar, I behold the spear<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Cormac, the son of Arth, had given the spear, which is here the foundation of the quarrel, to Oscar when he came to con∣gratulate him, upon Swaran's being ex∣pelled from Ireland.</NOTE> of Erin's kings. The spear of Temora<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ti'-mór-ri', <HI>the house of the great king,</HI> the name of the royal palace of the supreme kings of Ireland.</NOTE> glitters in thy hand, son of the woody Morven! It was the pride of an hundred kings, the death of heroes of old. Yield it, son of Ossian, yield it to car-borne Cairbar.</P>
<P>SHALL I yield, Oscar replied, the gift of Erin's injured king: the gift of fair-haired Cormac, when Oscar scattered his foes? I came to his halls of joy, when Swaran sled from Fingal. Gladness rose in the face of youth: he gave the spear of Temora. Nor did he give it to the feeble, O Cairbar, neither to the weak in soul. The darkness of thy face is not a storm to me; nor are thine eyes the flames of death. Do I fear thy clanging shield? Does my soul tremble at Olla's song? No: Cairbar, frighten thou the feeble; Os∣car is like a rock.</P>
<P>AND wilt thou not yield the spear, replied the rising pride of Cairbar? Are thy words mighty because Fingal is near, the gray-haired
<PB N="180" REF="208"/>
warrior of Morven. He has fought with little men. But he must vanish before Cairbar, like a thin pillar of mist before the winds of Atha<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Atha, <HI>shallow river:</HI> the name of Cair∣bar's seat in Connaught.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WERE he who fought with little men near the chief of Atha: Atha's chief would yield green Erin to avoid his rage. Speak not of the mighty, O Cairbar! but turn thy sword on me. Our strength is equal: but Fingal is renowned! the first of mortal men!</P>
<P>THEIR people saw the darkening chiefs. Their crowding steps are heard around. Their eyes roll in fire. A thousand swords are half unsheathed. Red-haired Olla raised the song of battle: the trem∣bling joy of Oscar's soul arose: the wonted joy of his soul when Fin∣gal's horn was heard.</P>
<P>DARK as the swelling wave of ocean before the rising winds, when it bends its head near the coast, came on the host of Cairbar.—Daughter of Toscar<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The poet means Malvina, the daugh∣ter of Toscar, to whom he addressed that part of the poem, which related to the death of Oscar her lover.</NOTE>! why that tear? He is not fallen yet. Many were the deaths of his arm before my hero fell!—Behold they fall before my son like the groves in the desart, when an angry ghost rushes through night, and takes their green heads in his hand! Morlath falls: Maronnan dies: Conachar trembles in his blood. Cairbar shrinks before Oscar's sword; and creeps in darkness be∣hind his stone. He lifted the spear in secret, and pierced my Os∣car's side. He falls forward on his shield: his knee sustains the chief: but his spear is in his hand. See gloomy Cairbar<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The Irish historians place the death of Cairbar, in the latter end of the third cen∣tury: they say, he was killed in battle a∣gainst Oscar the son of Ossian, but deny that he fell by his hand.

The steel pierced his forehead, and divided his red hair behind. He
<PB N="181" REF="209"/>
lay, like a shattered rock, which Cromla shakes from its side. But never more shall Oscar rise! he leans on his bossy shield. His spear is in his terrible hand: Erin's sons stood distant and dark. Their shouts arose, like the crowded noise of streams, and Lena echoed around.</P>
<P>FINGAL heard the sound; and took his father's spear. His steps are before us on the heath. He spoke the words of woe. I hear the noise of battle: and Oscar is alone. Rise, ye sons of Morven, and join the hero's sword.</P>
<P>OSSIAN rushed along the heath. Fillan bounded over Lena. Fer∣gus flew with feet of wind. Fingal strode in his strength, and the light of his shield is terrible. The sons of Erin saw it far distant; they trembled in their souls. They knew that the wrath of the king arose: and they foresaw their death. We first arrived; we fought; and Erin's chiefs withstood our rage. But when the king came, in the sound of his course, what heart of steel could stand! Erin fled over Lena. Death pursued their flight.</P>
<P>WE saw Oscar leaning on his shield. We saw his blood around. Silence darkened on every hero's face. Each turned his back and wept. The king strove to hide his tears. His gray beard whistled in the wind. He bends his head over his son: and his words are mixed with sighs.</P>
<P>AND art thou fallen, Oscar, in the midst of thy course? the heart of the aged beats over thee! He sees thy coming battles. He be∣holds
<PB N="182" REF="210"/>
the battles which ought to come, but they are cut off from thy fame. When shall joy dwell at Selma? When shall the song of grief cease on Morven. My sons fall by degrees: Fingal shall be the last of his race. The fame which I have received shall pass away: my age will be without friends. I shall sit like a gray cloud in my hall: nor shall I expect the return of a son, in the midst of his sounding arms. Weep, ye heroes of Morven! never more shall Oscar rise!</P>
<P>AND they did weep, O Fingal; dear was the hero to their souls. He went out to battle, and the foes vanished; he returned, in peace, amidst their joy. No father mourned his son slain in youth; no brother his brother of love. They fell, without tears, for the chief of the people was low! Bran<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bran was one of Fingal's dogs.—He∣was so remarkable for his fleetness, that the poet, in a piece which is not just now in the translator's hands, has given him the same properties with Virgil's Camilla.</NOTE> is howling at his feet: gloomy Luäth is sad, for he had often led them to the chace; to the bounding roes of the desart.</P>
<P>WHEN Oscar beheld his friends around, his white breast rose with a sigh.—The groans, he said, of my aged heroes, the howling of my dogs, the sudden bursts of the song of grief, have melted Os∣car's soul. My soul, that never melted before; it was like the steel of my sword.—Ossian, carry me to my hills! Raise the stones of my fame. Place the horn of the deer, and my sword within my narrow dwelling.—The torrent hereafter may raise the earth of my tomb: the hunter may find the steel and say, <Q REND="inline">"This has been Oscar's sword."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="211"/>
AND fallest thou, son of my fame! And shall I never see thee, Oscar! When others hear of their sons, I shall not hear of thee. The moss is on the stones of his tomb, and the mournful wind is there. The battle shall be fought without him: he shall not pur∣sue the dark-brown hinds. When the warrior returns from battles, and tells of other lands, he will say, I have seen a tomb, by the roaring stream, where a warrior darkly dwells: he was slain by car-borne Oscar, the first of mortal men.—I, perhaps, shall hear him, and a beam of joy will rise in my soul.</P>
<P>THE night would have descended in sorrow, and morning re∣turned in the shadow of grief: our chiefs would have stood like cold dropping rocks on Lena, and have forgot the war, did not the king disperse his grief, and raise his mighty voice. The chiefs, as new-wakened from dreams, lift their heads around.</P>
<P>How long shall we weep on Lena; or pour our tears in Ullin? The mighty will not return. Oscar shall not rise in his strength. The valiant must fall one day, and be no more known on his hills.—Where are our fathers, O warriors! the chiefs of the times of old? They have set like stars that have stone, we only hear the sound of their praise. But they were renowned in their day, and the terror of other times. Thus shall we pass, O warriors, in the day of our fall. Then let us be renowned when we may; and leave our fame behind us, like the last beams of the sun, when he hides his red head in the west.</P>
<P>ULLIN, my aged bard! take the ship of the king. Carry Oscar to Selma, and let the daughters of Morven weep. We shall fight in Erin for the race of fallen Cormac. The days of my years begin to fail: I feel the weakness of my arm. My fathers bend from
<PB N="184" REF="212"/>
their clouds, to receive their gray-hair'd son. But, Trenmor! be∣fore I go hence, one beam of my fame shall rise: so shall my days end, as my years begun, in fame: my life shall be one stream of light to other times.</P>
<P>ULLIN rais'd his white sails: the wind of the south came forth. He bounded on the waves towards Selma's walls.—I remained in my grief, but my words were not heard.—The feast is spread on Lena: an hundred heroes reared the tomb of Cairbar: but no song is raised over the chief; for his soul had been dark and bloody. We remembered the fall of Cormac! and what could we say in Cair∣bar's praise?</P>
<P>THE night came rolling down. The light of an hundred oaks arose. Fingal sat beneath a tree. The chief of Etha sat near the king, the gray-hair'd strength of Usnoth.</P>
<P>OLD Althan<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Althan, the son of Conachar, was the chief bard of Arth king of Ireland. After the death of Arth, Althan attended his son Cormac, and was present at his death.—He had made his escape from Cairbar, by the means of Cathmor, and coming to Fingal, related, as here, the death of his master Cormac.</NOTE> stood in the midst, and told the tale of fallen Cormac.

<P>ALTHAN! he said, with a smile, hast thou beheld my father? Heavy is the sword of the king, surely his arm was strong. O that I were like him in battle, when the rage of his wrath arose! then would I have met, like Cuchullin, the car-borne son of Cantéla! But years may come on, O Althan! and my arm be strong.—Hast thou heard of Semo's son, the chief of high Temora? He might have returned with his fame; for he promised to return to-night. My bards wait him with their songs, and my feast is spread.—</P>
<P>I HEARD the king in silence. My tears began to flow. I hid them with my gray locks; but he perceived my grief.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="214"/>
SON of Conachar! he said, is the king of Tura low? Why bursts thy sigh in secret? And why descends the tear?—Comes the car-borne Torlath? Or the sound of the red-haired Cairbar?—They come!—for I see thy grief; and Tura's king is low!—Shall I not rush to battle?—But I cannot lift the arms of my fathers!—O had mine arm the strength of Cuchullin, soon would Cairbar fly; the fame of my fathers would be renewed; and the actions of other times!</P>
<P>HE took his bow of yew. Tears flow from his sparkling eyes.—Grief saddens around: the bards bend forward from their harps. The blast touches their strings, and the sound of woe ascends.</P>
<P>A VOICE is heard at a distance, as of one in grief; it was Carril of other times, who came from the dark Slimora<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Slimora, a hill in Connaught, near which Cuchullin was killed.</NOTE>.—He told of the death of Cuchullin, and of his mighty deeds. The people were scattered around his tomb: their arms lay on the ground. They had forgot the battle, for the sound of his shield had ceased.</P>
<P>BUT who, said the soft-voiced Carril, come like the bounding roes? their stature is like the young trees of the plain, growing in a shower:—Soft and ruddy are their cheeks: but fearless souls look forth from their eyes?—Who but the sons of Usnoth, the car-borne chiefs of Etha? The people rise on every side, like the strength of an half-extinguished fire, when the winds come suddenly from the desart, on their rustling wings.—The sound of Caithbat's shield was heard. The heroes saw Cuchullin<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">That is, they saw a manifest likeness between the person of Nathos and Cuchullin.</NOTE>, in the form of lovely Nathos. So rolled his sparkling eyes, and such was his steps

on his heath.—Battles are fought at Lego: the sword of Na∣thos prevails. Soon shalt thou behold him in thy halls, king of woody Temora!—</P>
<P>AND soon may I behold him, O Carril! replied the returning joy of Cormac. But my soul is sad for Cuchullin; his voice was plea∣sant in mine ear.—Often have we moved on Dora, at the chace of the dark-brown hinds: his bow was unerring on the mountains.—He spoke of mighty men. He told of the deeds of my fathers; and I felt the joy of my breast.—But sit thou, at the feast, O Carril; I have often heard thy voice. Sing in the praise of Cuchullin; and of that mighty stranger.</P>
<P>DAY rose on Temora, with all the beams of the east. Trathin came to the hall, the son of old Gellama<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Geal-lamha, <HI>white-handed.</HI></NOTE>.—I behold, he said, a dark cloud in the desart, king of Innisfail! a cloud it seemed at first, but now a croud of men. One strides before them in his strength; and his red hair flies in the wind. His shield glitters to the beam of the east. His spear is in his hand.</P>
<P>CALL him to the feast of Temora, replied the king of Erin. My hall is the house of strangers, son of the generous Gelláma!—Per∣haps it is the chief of Etha, coming in the sound of his renown.—Hail, mighty stranger, art thou of the friends of Cormac?—But Carril, he is dark, and unlovely; and he draws his sword. Is that the son of Usnoth, bard of the times of old?</P>
<P>IT is not the son of Usnoth, said Carril, but the chief of Atha.—Why comest thou in thy arms to Temora, Cairbar of the
<PB N="188" REF="216"/>
gloomy brow? Let not thy sword rise against Cormac! Whither dost thou turn thy speed?</P>
<P>HE passed on in his darkness, and seized the hand of the king. Cormac foresaw his death, and the rage of his eyes arose.—Retire, thou gloomy chief of Atha: Nathos comes with battle.—Thou art bold in Cormac's hall, for his arm is weak.—The sword entered Cormac's side: he fell in the halls of his fathers. His fair hair is in the dust. His blood is smoaking round.</P>
<P>AND art thou fallen in thy halls, I said<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Althan speaks.</NOTE>, O son of noble Artho? The shield of Cuchullin was not near. Nor the spear of thy father. Mournful are the mountains of Erin, for the chief of the people is low!—Blest be thy soul, O Cormac! thou art snatched from the midst of thy course.</P>
<P>MY words came to the ears of Cairbar, and he closed us<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">That is, himself and Carril, as it af∣terwards appears.</NOTE> in the midst of darkness. He feared to stretch his sword to the bards<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The persons of the bards were so sa∣cred, that even he, who had just murdered his sovereign, feared to kill them.</NOTE>: though his soul was dark. Three days we pined alone: on the fourth, the noble Cathmor came.—He heard our voice from the cave; he turned the eye of his wrath on Cairbar.</P>
<P>Chief of Atha! he said, how long wilt thou pain my soul? Thy heart is like the rock of the desart; and thy thoughts are dark.—But thou art the brother of Cathmor, and he will fight thy battles.—But Cathmor's soul is not like thine, thou feeble hand of war! The light of my bosom is stained with thy deeds: the bards will not sing of my renown. They may say, <Q REND="inline">"Cathmor was brave,
<PB N="189" REF="217"/>
but he fought for gloomy Cairbar."</Q> They will pass over my tomb in silence, and my fame shall not be heard.—Cairbar! loose the bards: they are the sons of other times. Their voice shall be heard in other ages, when the kings of Temora have failed.—</P>
<P>WE came forth at the words of the chief. We saw him in his strength. He was like thy youth, O Fingal, when thou first didst list the spear.—His face was like the plain of the sun when it is bright: no darkness travelled over his brow. But he came with his thousands to Ullin; to aid the red-haired Cairbar: and now he comes to revenge his death, O king of woody Morven.—</P>
<P>AND let him come, replied the king; I love a foe like Cathmor. His soul is great; his arm is strong, and his battles are full of fame.—But the little soul is like a vapour that hovers round the marshy lake: it never rises on the green hill, lest the winds meet it there: its dwelling is in the cave, and it sends forth the dart of death.</P>
<P>USNOTH! thou hast heard the fame of Etha's car-borne chiefs.—Our young heroes, O warrior, are like the renown of our fathers.—They fight in youth, and they fall: their names are in the song.—But we are old, O Usnoth, let us not fall like aged oaks; which the blast overturns in secret. The hunter came past, and saw them lying gray across a stream. How have these fallen, he said, and whistling passed along.</P>
<P>RAISE the song of joy, ye bards of Morven, that our souls may forget the past.—The red stars look on us from the clouds, and silently descend. Soon shall the gray beam of the morning rise, and shew us the foes of Cormac.—Fillan! take the spear of the

king; go to Mora's dark-brown side. Let thine eyes travel over the heath, like flames of fire. Observe the foes of Fingal, and the course of generous Cathmor. I hear a distant sound, like the falling of rocks in the desart.—But strike thou thy shield, at times, that they may not come through night, and the same of Morven cease.—I begin to be alone, my son, and I dread the fall of my renown.</P>
<P>THE voice of the bards arose. The king leaned on the shield of Trenmor.—Sleep descended on his eyes, and his future battles rose in his dreams. The host are sleeping around. Dark-haired Fillan observed the foe. His steps are on a distant hill: we hear, at times, his clanging shield.</P>

<P>One of the Fragments of Ancient Poetry lately published, gives a different account of the death of Oscar, the son of Ossian. The translator, though he well knew the more probable tradition concerning that hero, was unwilling to reject a poem, which, if not really of Ossian's composition, has much of his manner, and concise turn of expression. A more correct copy of that fragment, which has since come to the translator's hands, has enabled him to cor∣rect the mistake, into which a similarity of names had led those who handed down the poem by tradition.—The heroes of the piece are Oscar the son of Caruth, and Dermid the son of Diaran. Ossian, or perhaps his imitator, opens the poem with a lamentation for Oscar, and afterwards, by an easy transition, relates the story of Oscar the son of Caruth, who seems to have bore the same character, as well as name, with Oscar the son of Ossian. Though the translator thinks he has good reason to reject the fragment as the com∣position of Ossian; yet as it is, after all, still somewhat doubtful whether it is or not, he has here subjoined it.</P>
<Q><P>WHY openest thou afresh the spring of my grief, O son of Alpin, inquiring how Oscar fell? My eyes are blind with tears; but memory beams on my heart. How can I relate the mournful death of the head of the people! Chief of the war∣riors, Oscar, my son, shall I see thee no more!</P>
<P>He fell as the moon in a storm; as the sun from the midst of his course, when clouds rise from the waste of the waves, when the blackness of the storm inwraps the rocks of Ardannider. I, like an an∣cient
oak on Morven, I moulder alone in my place. The blast hath lopped my branches away; and I tremble at the wings of the north. Chief of the war∣riors, Oscar, my son! shall I see thee no more!</P>
<P>But, son of Alpin, the hero fell not harmless as the grass of the field; the blood of the mighty was on his sword, and he travelled with death through the ranks of their pride. But Oscar, thou son of Ca∣ruth, thou hast fallen low! No enemy fell by thy hand. Thy spear was stained with the blood of thy friend.</P>
<P>Dermid and Oscar were one: They reaped the battle together. Their friend∣ship was strong as their steel; and death walked between them to the field. They came on the foe like two rocks falling from the brows of Ardven. Their swords were stained with the blood of the valiant: warriors fainted at their names. Who was equal to Oscar, but Dermid? and who to Dermid, but Oscar!</P>
<P>They killed mighty Dargo in the field; Dargo who never sled in war. His daugh∣ter was fair as the morn; mild as the beam of night. Her eyes, like two stars in a shower: her breath, the gale of spring: her breasts, as the new-fallen snow floating on the moving heath. The warriors saw her, and loved; their souls were fixed on the maid. Each loved her as his fame; each must possess her or die. But her soul was fixed on Oscar; the son of Caruth was the youth of her love. She forgot the blood of her father; and loved the hand that slew him.</P>
<P>Son of Caruth, said Dermid, I love; O Oscar, I love this maid. But her soul cleaveth unto thee; and nothing can heal Dermid. Here, pierce this bosom, Oscar; relieve me, my friend, with thy sword.</P>
<P>My sword, son of Diaran, shall never be stained with the blood of Dermid.</P>
<P>Who then is worthy to slay me, O Oscar son of Caruth? Let not my life pass away unknown. Let none but Oscar slay me. Send me with honour to the grave, and let my death be renowned.</P>
<P>Dermid, make use of thy sword; son of Diaran, wield thy steel. Would that I fell with thee! that my death came from the hand of Dermid!</P>
<P>They fought by the brook of the moun∣tain, by the streams of Branno. Blood tinged the running water, and curdled round the mossy stones. The stately Der∣mid fell; he fell, and smiled in death.</P>
<P>And fallest thou, son of Diaran, fallest thou by Oscar's hand! Dermid who ne∣ver yielded in war, thus do I see thee fall!—He went, and returned to the maid of his love; he returned, but she perceived his grief.</P>
<P>Why that gloom, son of Caruth? what shades thy mighty soul?</P>
<P>Though once renowned for the bow, O maid, I have lost my same. Fixed on a tree by the brook of the hill, is the shield of the valiant Gormur, whom I slew in battle. I have wasted the day in vain, nor could my arrow pierce it.</P>
<P>Let me try, son of Caruth, the skill of Dargo's daughter. My hands were taught the bow: my father delighted in my skill.</P>
<P>She went. He stood behind the shield. Her arrow flew, and pierced his breast.</P>
<P>Blessed be that hand of snow; and bles∣sed that bow of yew! Who but the daughter of Dargo was worthy to slay the son of Caruth? Lay me in the earth, my fair one; lay me by the side of Dermid.</P>
<P>Oscar! the maid replied, I have the soul of the mighty Dargo. Well pleased I can meet death. My sorrow I can end.—She pierced her white bosom with the steel. She fell; she trembled; and died.</P>
<P>By the brook of the hill their graves are laid; a birch's unequal shade covers their tomb. Often on their green earthen tombs the branchy sons of the mountain feed, when mid-day is all in flames, and silence over all the hills.</P></Q>

<HEAD>CARRIC-THURA: A POEM<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fingal, returning from an expedition which he had made into the Roman pro∣vince, resolved to visit Cathulla king of Inis-tore, and brother to Comála, whose story is related, at large, in the dramatic poem, published in this collection. Upon his coming in sight of Carric-thura, the pa∣lace of Cathulla, he observed a flame on its top, which, in those days, was a signal of distress. The wind drove him into a bay, at some distance from Carric-thura, and he was obliged to pass the night on the shore. Next day he attacked the army of Frothal king of Sora who had besieged Cathulla in his palace of Carric-thura, and took Frothal himself prisoner, after he had engaged him in a single combat. The de∣liverance of Carric-thura is the subject of the poem, but several other episodes are interwoven with it. It appears from tra∣dition, that this poem was addressed to a Culdee, or one of the first Christian missio∣naries, and that the story of the <HI>Spirit of Loda,</HI> supposed to be the ancient Odin of Scandinavia, was introduced by Ossian in opposition to the Culdee's doctrine. Be this as it will, it lets us into Ossian's no∣tions of a superior being; and shews that he was not addicted to the superstition which prevailed all the world over, before the introduction of Christianity.</NOTE>.</HEAD>

<P>SUCH was the song of Ullin, when Fingal returned from battle: when he returned in the fair blushing of youth; with all his heavy locks. His blue arms were on the hero; like a gray cloud on the sun, when he moves in his robes of mist, and shews but half his beams. His heroes follow the king: the feast of shells is spread. Fingal turns to his bards, and bids the song to rise.</P>
<P>VOICES of ecchoing Cona! he said, O bards of other times! Ye, on whose souls the blue hosts of our fathers rise! strike the harp in my hall; and let Fingal hear the song. Pleasant is the joy of grief! it is like the shower of spring, when it softens the branch of the oak, and the young leaf lifts its green head. Sing on, O bards, to-morrow we lift the sail. My blue course is through the ocean, to Carric-thura's walls; the mossy walls of Sarno, where Co∣mála dwelt. There the noble Cathulla, spreads the feast of shells. The boars of his woods are many, and the sound of the chace shall arise.</P>

<P>MY love is a son of the hill. He pursues the flying deer. His gray dogs are panting around him; his bow-string sounds in the wind. Dost thou rest by the sount of the rock, or by the noise of the mountain-stream? the rushes are nodding with the wind, the mist is flying over the hill. I will approach my love unperceived, and see him from the rock.

<P>AND I remember the chief, said the king of woody Morven; he consumed the battle in his rage. But now my eyes behold him not. I met him, one day, on the hill; his cheek was pale; his brow was dark. The sigh was frequent in his breast: his steps were to∣wards the desart. But now he is not in the crowd of my chiefs, when the sounds of my shields arise.

<P>CRONNAN! said Ullin of other times, raise the song of Shilric; when he returned to his hills, and Vinvela was no more. He leaned on her gray mossy stone; he thought Vinvela lived. He saw her fair-moving<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The distinction, which the ancient Scots made between good and bad spirits, was, that the former appeared sometimes in the day-time in lonely unfrequented places, but the latter never but by night, and in a dismal gloomy scene.</NOTE> on the plain: but the bright form lasted not: the

sun-beam fled from the field, and she was seen no more. Hear the song of Shilric, it is soft but sad.</P>
<P>I SIT by the mossy fountain; on the top of the hill of winds. One tree is rustling above me. Dark waves roll over the heath. The lake is troubled below. The deer descend from the hill. No hun∣ter at a distance is seen; no whistling cow-herd is nigh. It is mid-day: but all is silent. Sad are my thoughts alone. Didst thou but appear, O my love, a wanderer on the heath! thy hair floating on the wind behind thee; thy bosom heaving on the sight; thine eyes full of tears for thy friends, whom the mist of the hill had con∣cealed! Thee I would comfort, my love, and bring thee to thy fa∣ther's house.</P>
<P>BUT is it she that there appears, like a beam of light on the heath? bright as the moon in autumn, as the sun in a summer∣storm, comest thou, lovely maid, over rocks, over mountains to me?—She speaks: but how weak her voice! like the breeze in the reeds of the pool.</P>
<P>RETURNEST thou safe from the war? Where are thy friends, my love? I heard of thy death on the hill; I heard and mourned thee, Shilric!</P>
<P>YES, my fair, I return; but I alone of my race. Thou shalt see them no more: their graves I raised on the plain. But why art thou on the desert hill? Why on the heath, alone?</P>
<P>ALONE I am, O Shilric! alone in the winter-house. With grief for thee I expired. Shilric, I am pale in the tomb.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="226"/>
SHE fleets, she sails away; as gray mist before the wind!—and, wilt thou not stay, my love? Stay and behold my tears? fair thou appearest, Vinvela! fair thou wast, when alive!</P>
<P>BY the mossy fountain I will sit; on the top of the hill of winds. When mid-day is silent around, converse, O my love, with me! come on the wings of the gale! on the blast of the mountain, come! Let me hear thy voice, as thou passest, when mid-day is si∣lent around.</P>
<P>SUCH was the song of Cronnan, on the night of Selma's joy. But morning rose in the east; the blue waters rolled in light. Fingal bade his sails to rise, and the winds come rustling, from their hills. Inis-tore rose to sight, and Carric-thura's mossy towers. But the sign of distress was on their top: the green flame edged with smoke. The king of Morven struck his breast: he assumed, at once, his spear. His darkened brow bends forward to the coast: he looks back to the lagging winds. His hair is disordered on his back. The silence of the king is terrible.</P>
<P>NIGHT came down on the sea; Rotha's bay received the ship. A rock bends along the coast with all its ecchoing wood. On the top is the circle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>The circle of Loda</HI> is supposed to be a place of worship among the Scandinavians, as the spirit of Loda is thought to be the same with their god Odin.</NOTE> of Loda, and the mossy stone of power. A nar∣row plain spreads beneath, covered with grass and aged trees, which the midnight winds, in their wrath, had torn from the shaggy rock. The blue course of a stream is there; and the lonely blast of ocean pursues the thistle's beard.</P>
<P>THE flame of three oaks arose: the feast is spread around: but the soul of the king is sad, for Carric-thura's battling chief. The
<PB N="199" REF="227"/>
wan, cold moon rose, in the east. Sleep descended on the youths! Their blue helmets glitter to the beam; the fading fire decays. But sleep did not rest on the king: he rose in the midst of his arms, and slowly ascended the hill to behold the flame of Sarno's tower.</P>
<P>THE flame was dim and distant; the moon hid her red face in the east. A blast came from the mountain, and bore, on its wings, the spirit of Loda. He came to his place in his terrors<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He is described, in a simile, in the poem concerning the death of Cuchullin.</NOTE>, and he shook his dusky spear.—His eyes appear like flames in his dark face; and his voice is like distant thunder. Fingal advanced with the spear of his strength, and raised his voice on high.</P>
<P>SON of night, retire: call thy winds and fly! Why dost thou come to my presence, with thy shadowy arms? Do I fear thy gloomy form, dismal spirit of Loda? Weak is thy shield of clouds: feeble is that meteor, thy sword. The blast rolls them together; and thou thyself dost vanish. Fly from my presence son of night! call thy winds and fly!</P>
<P>DOST thou force me from my place, replied the hollow voice? The people bend before me. I turn the battle in the field of the valiant. I look on the nations and they vanish: my nostrils pour the blast of death. I come<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">There is a great resemblance between the terrors of this mock divinity, and those of the true God, as they are described in the 18th Psalm.</NOTE> abroad on the winds: the tempests are before my face. But my dwelling is calm, above the clouds, the fields of my rest are pleasant.</P>
<P>DWELL then in thy calm fields, said Fingal, and let Comhal's son be forgot. Do my steps ascend, from my hills, into thy peaceful plains? Do I meet thee, with a spear, on thy cloud, spirit of dis∣mal
<PB N="200" REF="228"/>
Loda? Why then dost thou frown on Fingal? or shake thine airy spear? But thou frownest in vain: I never fled from mighty men. And shall the sons of the wind frighten the king of Mor∣ven? No: he knows the weakness of their arms.</P>
<P>FLY to thy land, replied the form: receive the wind and fly. The blasts are in the hollow of my hand: the course of the storm is mine. The king of Sora is my son, he bends at the stone of my power. His battle is around Carric-thura; and he will prevail. Fly to thy land, son of Comhal, or feel my flaming wrath.</P>
<P>HE lifted high his shadowy spear; and bent forward his terrible height. But the king, advancing, drew his sword; the blade of dark-brown Luno<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The famous sword of Fingal, made by Lun, or Luno, a smith of Lochlin.</NOTE>. The gleaming path of the steel winds thro' the gloomy ghost. The form fell shapeless into air, like a column of smoke, which the staff of the boy disturbs, as it rises from the half-extinguished furnace.</P>
<P>THE spirit of Loda shrieked, as, rolled into himself, he rose on the wind. Inistore shook at the sound. The waves heard it on the deep: they stopped, in their course, with fear: the compa∣nions of Fingal started, at once; and took their heavy spears. They missed the king: they rose with rage; all their arms resound.</P>
<P>THE moon came forth in the east. The king returned in the gleam of his arms. The joy of his youths was great, their souls settled, as a sea from a storm. Ullin raised the song of gladness. The hills of Inistore rejoiced. The flame of the oak arose; and the tales of heroes are told.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="229"/>
BUT Frothal, Sora's battling king, sits in sadness beneath a tree. The host spreads around Carric-thura. He looks towards the walls with rage. He longs for the blood of Cathulla, who, once, over∣came the king in war.—When Annir reigned<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Annir was also the father of Erragon, who was king after the death of his brother Frothal. The death of Erragon is the subject of <HI>the battle of Lora,</HI> a poem in this collection.</NOTE> in Sora, the fa∣ther of car-borne Frothal, a blast rose on the sea, and carried Frothal to Inistore. Three days he feasted in Sarno's halls, and saw the slow rolling eyes of Comála. He loved her, in the rage of youth, and rushed to seize the white-armed maid. Cathulla met the chief. The gloomy battle rose. Frothal is bound in the hall: three days he pined alone. On the fourth, Sarno sent him to his ship, and he re∣turned to his land. But wrath darkened in his soul against the noble Cathulla. When Annir's stone<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">That is, after the death of Annir. To erect the stone of one's fame, was, in other words, to say that the person was dead.</NOTE> of fame arose, Frothal came in his strength. The battle burned round Carric-thura, and Sarno's mossy walls.</P>
<P>MORNING rose on Inistore. Frothal struck his dark-brown shield. His chiefs started at the sound; they stood, but their eyes were turned to the sea. They saw Fingal coming in his strength; and first the noble Thubar spoke.</P>
<P>WHO comes like the stag of the mountain, with all his herd be∣hind him? Frothal, it is a foe; I see his forward spear. Perhaps it is the king of Morven, Fingal the first of men. His actions are well known on Gormal; the blood of his foes is in Starno's halls. Shall I ask the peace<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Honourable terms of peace.</NOTE> of kings? He is like the thunder of heaven.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="230"/>
SON of the feeble hand, said Frothal, shall my days begin in dark∣ness? Shall I yield before I have conquered in battle, chief of streamy Tora? The people would say in Sora, Frothal flew forth like a meteor; but the dark cloud met it, and it is no more. No: Thubar, I will never yield; my fame shall surround me like light. No: I will never yield, king of streamy Tora.</P>
<P>HE went forth with the stream of his people, but they met a rock: Fingal stood unmoved, broken they rolled back from his side. Nor did they roll in safety; the spear of the king pursued their flight. The field is covered with heroes. A rising hill preserved the flying host.</P>
<P>FROTHAL saw their flight. The rage of his bosom rose. He bent his eyes to the ground, and called the noble Thubar.—Thu∣bar! my people fled. My fame has ceased to rise. I will fight the king; I feel my burning soul. Send a bard to demand the com∣bat. Speak not against Frothal's words.—But, Thubar! I love a maid; she dwells by Thano's stream, the white-bosomed daughter of Herman, Utha with the softly-rolling eyes. She feared the daughter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By the daughter of Inistore, Frothal means Comala, of whose death Utha pro∣bably had not heard; consequently she feared that the former passion of Frothal for Comala might return.</NOTE> of Inistore, and her soft sighs rose, at my departure. Tell to Utha that I am low; but that my soul delighted in her.</P>
<P>SUCH were his words, resolved to fight. But the soft sigh of Utha was near. She had followed her hero over the sea, in the armour of a man. She rolled her eye on the youth, in secret, from beneath a glittering helmet. But now she saw the bard as he went, and the spear fell thrice from her hand. Her loose hair flew on the
<PB N="203" REF="231"/>
wind. Her white breast rose, with sighs. She lifted up her eyes to the king; she would speak, but thrice she failed.</P>
<P>FINGAL heard the words of the bard; he came in the strength of steel. They mixed their deathful spears, and raised the gleam of their swords. But the steel of Fingal descended and cut Frothal's shield in twain. His fair side is exposed; half bent he foresees his death.</P>
<P>DARKNESS gathered on Utha's soul. The tear rolled down her cheek. She rushed to cover the chief with her shield; but a fallen oak met her steps. She fell on her arm of snow; her shield, her helmet flew wide. Her white bosom heaved to the sight; her dark-brown hair is spread on earth.</P>
<P>FINGAL pitied the white-armed maid: he stayed the uplifted sword. The tear was in the eye of the king, as, bending forward, he spoke. King of streamy Sora! fear not the sword of Fingal. It was never stained with the blood of the vanquished; it never pierced a fallen foe. Let thy people rejoice along the blue waters of Tora: let the maids of thy love be glad. Why shouldest thou fall in thy youth, king of streamy Sora?</P>
<P>FROTHAL heard the words of Fingal, and saw the rising maid: they<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Frothal and Utha.</NOTE> stood in silence, in their beauty: like two young trees of the plain, when the shower of spring is on their leaves, and the loud winds are laid.</P>
<P>DAUGHTER of Herman, said Frothal, didst thou come from Tora's streams; didst thou come, in thy beauty, to behold thy war∣rior

low? But he was low before the mighty, maid of the slow-roll∣ing eye! The feeble did not overcome the son of car-borne Annir. Terrible art thou, O king of Morven! in battles of the spear. But, in peace, thou art like the sun, when he looks thro' a silent shower: the flowers lift their fair heads before him; and the gales shake their rustling wings. O that thou wert in Sora! that my feast were spread!—The future kings of Sora would see thy arms and rejoice. They would rejoice at the fame of their fathers, who be∣held the mighty Fingal.</P>
<P>SON of Annir, replied the king, the fame of Sora's race shall be heard.—When chiefs are strong in battle, then does the song arise! But if their swords are stretched over the feeble: if the blood of the weak has stained their arms; the bard shall forget them in the song, and their tombs shall not be known. The stranger shall come and build there, and remove the heaped-up earth. An half-worn sword shall rise before him; and bending above it, he will say, <Q REND="inline">"These are the arms of chiefs of old, but their names are not in the song."</Q>—Come thou, O Frothal, to the feast of Inistore; let the maid of thy love be there; and our faces will brighten with joy.</P>
<P>FINGAL took his spear, moving in the steps of his might. The gates of Carric-thura are opened. The feast of shells is spread.—The voice of music arose. Gladness brightened in the hall.—The voice of Ullin was heard; the harp of Selma was strung.—Utha rejoiced in his presence, and demanded the song of grief; the big tear hung in her eye, when the soft<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is a propriety in introducing this episode, as the situations of Crimora and Utha were so similar.</NOTE> Crimora spoke.

<P>AND did they return no more? said Utha's bursting sigh. Fell the mighty in battle, and did Crimora live?—Her steps were lonely, and her soul was sad for Connal.

the narrow plain. A tree stands alone on the hill, and marks the slumbering Connal. The leaves whirl round with the wind, and strew the grave of the dead. At times are seen here the ghosts of the deceased, when the musing hunter alone stalks slowly over the heath.</P>
<P>WHO can reach the source of thy race, O Connal? and who re∣count thy fathers? Thy family grew like an oak on the mountain, which meeteth the wind with its lofty head. But now it is torn from the earth. Who shall supply the place of Connal?</P>
<P>HERE was the din of arms; and here the groans of the dying. Bloody are the wars of Fingal! O Connal! it was here thou didst fall. Thine arm was like a storm; thy sword a beam of the sky; thy height, a rock on the plain; thine eyes, a furnace of fire. Louder than a storm was thy voice, in the battles of thy steel. Warriors fell by thy sword, as the thistle by the staff of a boy.</P>
<P>DARGO the mighty came on, like a cloud of thunder. His brows were contracted and dark. His eyes like two caves in a rock. Bright rose their swords on each side; dire was the clang of their steel.</P>
<P>THE daughter of Rinval was near; Crimora bright in the armour of man; her yellow hair is loose behind, her bow is in her hand. She followed the youth to the war, Connal her much-beloved. She drew the string on Dargo; but erring pierced her Connal. He falls like an oak on the plain; like a rock from the shaggy hill. What shall she do, hapless maid!—He bleeds; her Connal dies.

<HEAD>THE SONGS of SELMA<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This poem fixes the antiquity of a custom, which is well known to have pre∣vailed afterwards, in the north of Scotland, and in Ireland. The bards, at an annual feast, provided by the king or chief, re∣peated their poems, and such of them as were thought, by him, worthy of being preserved, were carefully taught to their children, in order to have them transmitted to posterity.—It was one of those occa∣sions that afforded the subject of the present poem to Ossian.—It is called in the origi∣nal, the songs of Selma, which title it was thought proper to adopt in the translation.</P>
<P>The poem is entirely lyric, and has great variety of versification. The address to the evening star, with which it opens, has in the original all the harmony that num∣bers could give it; flowing down with all that tranquility and softness, which the scene described naturally inspires.—Three of the songs which are introduced in this piece, were published among the fragments of ancient poetry, printed last year.</P></NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>STAR of the falling night! fair is thy light in the west! thou liftest thy unshorn head from thy cloud: thy steps are stately on thy hill. What dost thou behold in the plain? The stormy winds are laid. The murmur of the torrent comes from afar. Roaring waves climb the distant rock. The flies of evening are on their feeble wings, and the hum of their course is on the field. What dost thou behold, fair light? But thou dost smile and depart. The waves come with joy around thee, and bathe thy lovely hair. Farewel, thou silent beam!—Let the light of Ossian's soul arise.</P>

AND it does arise in its strength! I behold my departed friends. Their gathering is on Lora, as in the days that are past.—Fingal comes like a watry column of mist; his heroes are around.

<SPEAKER>COLMA.</SPEAKER>
<P>IT is night;—I am alone, forlorn on the hill of storms. The wind is heard in the mountain. The torrent shrieks down the rock. No hut receives me from the rain; forlorn on the hill of winds.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="239"/>
RISE, moon! from behind thy clouds; stars of the night appear! Lead me, some light, to the place where my love rests from the toil of the chace! his bow near him, unstrung; his dogs panting around him. But here I must sit alone, by the rock of the mossy stream. The stream and the wind roar; nor can I hear the voice of my love.</P>
<P>WHY delays my Salgar, why the son of the hill, his promise? Here is the rock, and the tree; and here the roaring stream. Thou didst promise with night to be here. Ah! whither is my Salgar gone? With thee I would fly, my father; with thee, my brother of pride. Our race have long been soes*; but we are not foes, O Salgar!</P>
<P>CEASE a little while, O wind! stream, be thou silent a while! let my voice be heard over the heath; let my wanderer hear me. Salgar! it is I who call. Here is the tree, and the rock. Salgar, my love! I am here. Why delayest thou thy coming?</P>
<P>Lo! the moon appeareth. The flood is bright in the vale. The rocks are grey on the face of the hill. But I see him not on the brow; his dogs before him tell not that he is coming. Here I must sit alone.</P>
<P>BUT who are these that lie beyond me on the heath? Are they my love and my brother?—Speak to me, O my friends! they answer not. My soul is tormented with fears.—Ah! they are dead. Their swords are red from the fight. O my brother! my brother! why hast thou slain my Salgar? why, O Salgar! hast thou slain my brother? Dear were ye both to me! what shall I say in your praise? Thou wert fair on the hill among thousands; he was
<PB N="212" REF="240"/>
terrible in fight. Speak to me; hear my voice, sons of my-love! But alas! they are silent; silent for ever! Cold are their breasts of clay!</P>
<P>OH! from the rock of the hill; from the top of the windy mountain, speak ye ghosts of the dead! speak, I will not be afraid.—Whither are ye gone to rest? In what cave of the hill shall I find you? No feeble voice is on the wind: no answer half-drowned in the storms of the hill.</P>
<P>I SIT in my grief. I wait for morning in my tears. Rear the tomb, ye friends of the dead; but close it not till Colma come. My life flies away like a dream: why should I stay behind? Here shall I rest with my friends, by the stream of the sounding rock. When night comes on the hill; when the wind is on the heath; my ghost shall stand in the wind, and mourn the death of my friends. The hunter shall hear from his booth. He shall fear but love my voice. For sweet shall my voice be for my friends; for pleasant were they both to me.</P>

<P>SUCH was thy song, Minona softly-blushing maid of Torman. Our tears descended for Colma, and our souls were sad.—Ullin came with the harp, and gave the song of Alpin.—The voice of Alpin was pleasant: the soul of Ryno was a beam of fire. But they had rested in the narrow house: and their voice was not heard in Selma.—Ullin had returned one day from the chace, before the heroes fell. He heard their strife on the hill; their song was soft but sad. They mourned the fall of Morar, first of mortal men. His soul was like the soul of Fingal; his sword like the sword of Oscar.—But he fell, and his father mourned: his sister's eyes were full of tears.—Minona's eyes were full of tears, the sister of car-borne

Red through the stony vale comes down the stream of the hill. Sweet are thy murmurs, O stream! but more sweet is the voice I hear. It is the voice of Alpin, the son of the song, mourning for the dead. Bent is his head of age, and red his tear∣ful eye.

<P>MY tears, O Ryno! are for the dead; my voice, for the inhabi∣tants of the grave. Tall thou art on the hill; fair among the sons of the plain. But thou shalt fall like Morar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mór-ér, <HI>great man.</HI></NOTE>; and the mourner shall sit on thy tomb. The hills shall know thee no more; thy bow shall lie in the hall, unstrung.</P>

<P>THOU wert swift, O Morar! as a roe on the hill; terrible as a meteor of fire. Thy wrath was as the storm. Thy sword in battle, as lightning in the field. Thy voice was like a stream after rain; like thunder on distant hills. Many fell by thy arm; they were con∣sumed in the flames of thy wrath.</P>
<P>BUT when thou didst return from war, how peaceful was thy brow! Thy face was like the sun after rain; like the moon in the

silence of night; calm as the breast of the lake when the loud wind is laid.</P>
<P>NARROW is thy dwelling now; dark the place of thine abode. With three steps I compass thy grave, O thou who wast so great before! Four stones, with their heads of moss, are the only memo∣rial of thee. A tree with scarce a leaf, long grass which whistles in the wind, mark to the hunter's eye the grave of the mighty Morar. Morar! thou art low indeed. Thou hast no mother to mourn thee; no maid with her tears of love. Dead is she that brought thee forth. Fallen is the daughter of Morglan.</P>
<P>WHO on his staff is this? who is this, whose head is white with age, whose eyes are red with tears, who quakes at every step.—It is thy father<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Torman, the son of Carthul, lord of I-mora, one of the western isles.</NOTE>, O Morar! the father of no son but thee. He heard of thy fame in battle; he heard of foes dispersed. He heard of Morar's fame; why did he not hear of his wound? Weep, thou father of Morar! weep; but thy son heareth thee not. Deep is the sleep of the dead; low their pillow of dust. No more shall he hear thy voice; no more shall he awake at thy call. When shall it be morn in the grave, to bid the slumberer awake?</P>
<P>FAREWEL, thou bravest of men! thou conqueror in the field! but the field shall see thee no more; nor the dark wood be lightened with the splendor of thy steel. Thou hast left no son. But the song shall preserve thy name. Future times shall hear of thee; they shall hear of the fallen Morar.</P>

Is there a cause to mourn? The song comes, with its music, to melt and please the soul. It is like soft mist, that, rising from a lake, pours on the si∣lent vale; the green flowers are filled with dew, but the sun re∣turns in his strength, and the mist is gone. Why art thou sad, O Armin, chief of sea-surrounded Gorma?</P>
<P>SAD! I am indeed: nor small my cause of woe!—Carmor, thou hast lost no son; thou hast lost no daughter of beauty. Colgar the valiant lives; and Annira fairest maid. The boughs of thy family flourish, O Carmor! but Armin is the last of his race. Dark is thy bed, O Daura! and deep thy sleep in the tomb.—When shalt thou awake with thy songs? with all thy voice of music?</P>
<P>RISE, winds of autumn, rise; blow upon the dark heath! streams of the mountains, roar! howl, ye tempests, in the top of the oak! walk through broken clouds, O moon! show by intervals thy pale face! bring to my mind that sad night, when all my children fell; when Arindal the mighty fell; when Dura the lovely failed.</P>
<P>DAURA, my daughter! thou wert fair; fair as the moon on the hills of Fura<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Fuar-a, <HI>cold island.</HI></NOTE>; white as the driven snow; sweet as the breath∣ing gale. Arindal, thy bow was strong, thy spear was swift in the field: thy look was like mist on the wave; thy shield, a red cloud in a storm. Armar, renowned in war, came, and sought Daura's love; he was not long denied; fair was the hope of their friends.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="244"/>
ERATH, son of Odgal, repined; for his brother was slain by Armar. He came disguised like a son of the sea: fair was his skiff on the wave; white his locks of age; calm his serious brow. Fair∣est of women, he said, lovely daughter of Armin! a rock not distant in the sea, bears a tree on its side; red shines the fruit afar. There Armor waits for Daura. I came to carry his love along the roll∣ing sea.</P>
<P>SHE went; and she called on Armar. Nought answered, but the son<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By <HI>the son of the rock</HI> the poet means the ecchoing back of the human voice from a rock. The vulgar were of opinion, that this repetition of found was made by a spi∣rit within the rock; and they, on that ac∣count, called it <HI>mac-talla; the son who dwells in the rock.</HI></NOTE> of the rock. Armor, my love! my love! why tormentest thou me with fear? hear, son of Ardnart, hear: it is Daura who calleth thee! Erath the traitor fled laughing to the land. She lifted up her voice, and cried for her brother and her father. Arin∣dal! Armin! none to relieve your Daura.</P>
<P>HER voice came over the sea. Arindal my son descended from the hill; rough in the spoils of the chace. His arrows rattled by his side; his bow was in his hand: five dark gray dogs attended his steps. He saw fierce Erath on the shore: he seized and bound him to an oak. Thick fly the thongs<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The poet here only means that Er∣ath was bound with leathern thongs.</NOTE> of the hide around his limbs; he loads the wind with his groans.</P>
<P>ARINDAL ascends the deep in his boat, to bring Daura to land. Armar came in his wrath, and let fly the gray-feathered shaft. It sung; it sunk in thy heart, O Arindal my son! for Erath the trai∣tor thou diedst. The oar is stopped at once; he panted on the rock
<PB N="217" REF="245"/>
and expired. What is thy grief, O Daura, when round thy feet is poured thy brother's blood.</P>
<P>THE boat is broken in twain by the waves. Armar plunges into the sea, to rescue his Daura or die. Sudden a blast from the hill comes over the waves. He sunk, and he rose no more.</P>
<P>ALONE, on the sea-beat rock, my daughter was heard to com∣plain. Frequent and loud were her cries; nor could her father re∣lieve her. All night I stood on the shore. I saw her by the faint beam of the moon. All night I heard her cries. Loud was the wind; and the rain beat hard on the side of the mountain. Before morning appeared, her voice was weak. It died away, like the evening-breeze among the grass of the rocks. Spent with grief she expired. And left thee Armin alone: gone is my strength in the war, and fallen my pride among women.</P>
<P>WHEN the storms of the mountain come; when the north lifts the waves on high; I sit by the sounding shore, and look on the fatal rock. Often by the setting moon I see the ghosts of my chil∣dren. Half-viewless, they walk in mournful conference together. Will none of you speak in pity? They do not regard their father. I am sad, O Carmor, nor small my cause of woe!</P>
<P>SUCH were the words of the bards in the days of the song; when the king heard the music of harps, and the tales of other times. The chiefs gathered from all their hills, and heard the lovely sound. They praised the voice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ossian is sometimes poetically called <HI>the voice of Cona.</HI></NOTE> of Cona! the first among a thousand bards. But age is now on my tongue; and my soul has failed. I hear,

sometimes, the ghosts of bards, and learn their pleasant song. But memory fails on my mind; I hear the call of years. They say, as they pass along, why does Ossian sing? Soon shall he lie in the nar∣row house, and no bard shall raise his fame.</P>
<P>ROLL on, ye dark-brown years, for ye bring no joy on your course. Let the tomb open to Ossian, for his strength has failed. The sons of the song are gone to rest; my voice remains, like a blast, that roars, lonely, on a sea-surrounded rock, after the winds are laid. The dark moss whistles there, and the distant mariner sees the waving trees.</P>

<HEAD>CALTHON and COLMAL: A POEM<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This piece, as many more of Ossian's compositions, is addressed to one of the first Christian missionaries.—The story of the poem is handed down, by tradition, thus—In the country of the Britons between the walls, two chiefs lived in the days of Fin∣gal, Dunthalmo, lord of Teutha, supposed to be the Tweed; and Rathmor, who dwelt at Clutha, well known to be the river Clyde.—Rathmor was not more renowned for his generosity and hospitality, than Dunthalmo was infamous for his cruelty and ambition.—Dunthalmo, thro' envy, or on account of some private seuds, which subsisted between the families, mur∣dered Cathmor at a seast; but being after∣wards touched with remorse, he educated the two sons of Rathmor, Calthon and Colmar, in his own house.—They grow∣ing up to man's estate, dropped some hints that they intended to revenge the death of their father, upon which Dunthalmo shut them up in two caves on the banks of Teutha, intending to take them off pri∣vately.—Colmal, the daughter of Dun∣thalmo, who was secretly in love with Calthon, helped him to make his escape from prison, and sled with him to Fingal, disguised in the habit of a young warrior, and implored his aid against Dunthalmo.—Fingal sent Ossian with three hundred men, to Colmar's relief.—Dunthalmo hav∣ing previously murdered Colmar, came to a battle with Ossian; but he was killed by that hero, and his army totally defeated.</P>

<P>DOST thou not behold, son of the rock, a shield in Ossian's hall? It is marked with the strokes of battle; and the brightness of its bosses has failed. That shield the great Dunthalmo bore, the chief of streamy Teutha.—Dunthalmo bore it in battle, before he fell by Ossian's spear. Listen, son of the rock, to the tale of other years.—</P>
<P>RATHMOR was a chief of Clutha. The feeble dwelt in his hall. The gates of Rathmor were never closed; his feast was always spread. The sons of the stranger came, and blessed the generous chief of Clutha. Bards raised the song, and touched the harp: and joy brightened on the face of the mournful.—Dunthalmo came, in his pride, and rushed into the combat of Rathmor. The chief of Clutha overcame: the rage of Dunthalmo rose—He came, by night, with his warriors; and the mighty Rathmor fell. He fell in his halls, where his feast was often spread for strangers.—</P>

COLMAR and Calthon were young, the sons of car-borne Rath∣mor. They came, in the joy of youth, into their father's hall. They behold him in his blood, and their bursting tears descend.—The soul of Dunthalmo melted, when he saw the children of youth; he brought them to Alteutha's<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Al-teutha, or rather Balteutha, <HI>the town of Tweed,</HI> the name of Dunthalmo's seat.

<P>THEY saw the sallen walls of their fathers; they saw the green thorn in the hall. Their tears descended in secret; and, at times, their faces were mournful. Dunthalmo beheld their grief: his darkening soul designed their death. He closed them in two caves, on the ecchoing banks of Teutha. The sun did not come there with his beams; nor the moon of heaven by night. The sons of Rathmor remained in darkness, and soresaw their death.</P>
<P>THE daughter of Dunthalmo wept in silence, the fair-haired, blue-eyed Colmal<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Caol-mhal, <HI>a woman with small eye-brows;</HI> small eye-brows were a distinguish∣ing part of beauty in Ossian's time: and he seldom fails to give them to the sine women of his poems.</NOTE>. Her eye had rolled in secret on Calthon; his loveliness swelled in her soul. She trembled for her warrior; but what could Colmal do? Her arm could not lift the spear; nor was the sword sormed for her side. Her white breast never rose beneath a mail. Neither was her eye the terror of heroes. What canst thou do, O Colmal! for the falling chief?—Her steps are unequal; her hair is loose: her eye looked wildly through her tears.—She

came, by night, to the hall<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That is, the hall where the arms taken from enemies were hung up as trophies. Ossian is very careful to make his stories probable; for he makes Colmal put on the arms of a youth killed in his first battle, as more proper for a young woman, who cannot be supposed strong enough to carry the armour of a fuil-grown warrior.</NOTE>; and armed her lovely form in steel; the steel of a young warrior, who fell in the first of his battles.—She came to the cave of Calthon, and loosed the thong from his hands.</P>
<P>ARISE, son of Rathmor, she said, arise, the night is dark. Let us fly to the king of Selma<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Fingal.</NOTE>, chief of fallen Clutha! I am the son of Lamgal, who dwelt in thy father's hall. I heard of thy dark dwelling in the cave, and my soul arose. Arise, son of Rathmor, for the night is dark.—</P>
<P>BLEST voice! replied the chief, comest thou from the darkly-rolling clouds? for often the ghosts of his fathers descend to Cal∣thon's dreams, since the sun has retired from his eyes, and darkness has dwelt around him. Or art thou the son of Lamgal, the chief I often saw in Clutha? But will I fly to Fingal, and Colmar my brother low? Will I fly to Morven, and the hero closed in night? No: give me that spear, son of Lamgal, Calthon will defend his brother.</P>
<P>A THOUSAND heroes, replied the maid, stretch their spears round car-borne Colmar. What can Calthon do against a host so great? Let us fly to the king of Morven, he will come with battle. His arm is stretched forth to the unhappy; the lightning of his sword is round the weak.—Arise, thou son of Rathmor; the shadows will fly away. Dunthalmo will behold thy steps on the field, and thou must fall in thy youth.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="251"/>
THE sighing hero rose; his tears descend for car-borne Colmar. He came with the maid to Selma's hall; but he knew not that it was Colmal. The helmet cover'd her lovely face; and her breast rose beneath the steel. Fingal returned from the chace, and found the lovely strangers. They were like two beams of light, in the midst of the hall.</P>
<P>THE kind heard the tale of grief; and turned his eyes around. A thousand heroes half-rose before him; claiming the war of Teu∣tha.—I came with my spear from the hill, and the joy of battle rose in my breast: for the king spoke to Ossian in the midst of the people.</P>
<P>SON of my strength, he said, take the spear of Fingal; go to Teutha's mighty stream, and save the car-borne Colmar.—Let thy fame return before thee like a pleasant gale; that my soul may re∣joice over my son, who renews the renown of our fathers.—Ossian! be thou a storm in battle; but mild when the foes are low!—It was thus my fame arose, O my son; and be thou like Selma's chief.—When the haughty come to my halls, my eyes behold them not. But my arm is stretched forth to the unhappy. My sword defends the weak.</P>
<P>I REJOICED in the words of the king: and took my rattling arms.—Diaran<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Diaran, father of that Connal who was unfortunately killed by Crimora, his mistress.</NOTE> rose at my side, and Dargo<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dargo, the son of Collath, is cele∣brated in other poems by Ossian. He is said to have been killed by a boar at a hunting party. The lamentation of his mistress, or wise, Mingala, over his body, is extant; but whether it is of Ossian's composition, I cannot determine. It is generally ascribed to him, and has much of his manner; but some traditions mention it as an imitation by some later bard.—As it has some poetical merit, I have subjoined it.

Three hundred youths followed our steps: the lovely strangers were at my side. Dunthalmo heard the sound of our approach; he gathered the strength of Teutha.—He stood on a hill with his host; they were like rocks broken with thunder, when their bent trees are singed and bare, and the streams of their chinks have failed.</P>
<P>THE stream of Teutha rolled, in its pride, before the gloomy foe. I sent a bard to Dunthalmo, to offer the combat on the plain; but he smiled in the darkness of his pride.—His unsettled host moved on the hill; like the mountain-cloud, when the blast has entered its womb, and scatters the curling gloom on every side.</P>
<P>THEY brought Colmar to Teutha's bank, bound with a thousand thongs. The chief is sad, but lovely, and his eye is on his friends; for we stood, in our arms, on the opposite bank of Teutha. Dun∣thalmo
<PB N="225" REF="253"/>
came with his spear, and pierced the hero's side: he rolled on the bank in his blood, and we heard his broken sighs.</P>
<P>CALTHON rushed into the stream: I bounded forward on my spear. Teutha's race fell before us. Night came rolling down. Dunthalmo rested on a rock, amidst an aged wood. The rage of his bosom burned against the car-borne Calthon.—But Calthon stood in his grief; he mourned the fallen Colmar; Colmar slain in youth, before his fame arose.</P>
<P>I BADE the song of woe to rise, to sooth the mournful chief; but he stood beneath a tree, and often threw his spear on earth.—The humid eye of Colmal rolled near in a secret tear: she foresaw the fall of Dunthalmo, or of Clutha's battling chief.</P>
<P>Now half the night had passed away. Silence and darkness were on the field; sleep rested on the eyes of the heroes: Calthon's settling soul was still. His eyes were half-closed; but the murmur of Teutha had not yet failed in his ear.—Pale, and shewing his wounds, the ghost of Colmar came: he bended his head over the hero, and raised his feeble voice.</P>
<P>SLEEPS the son of Rathmor in his night, and his brother low? Did we not rise to the chace together, and pursue the dark-brown hinds? Colmar was not forgot till he fell; till death had blasted his youth. I lie pale beneath the rock of Lona. O let Calthon rise! the morning comes with its beams; and Dunthalmo will dis∣honour the fallen.</P>
<P>HE passed away in his blast. The rising Calthon saw the steps of his departure.—He rushed in the sound of his steel; and unhappy Colmal rose. She followed her hero through night, and dragged
<PB N="226" REF="254"/>
her spear behind.—But when Calthon came to Lona's rock, he found his fallen brother—The rage of his bosom rose, and he rushed among the foe. The groans of death ascend. They close around the chief.—He is bound in the midst, and brought to gloomy Dun∣thalmo.—The shout of joy arose; and the hills of night replied.—</P>
<P>I started at the sound: and took my father's spear. Diaran rose at my side; and the youthful strength of Dargo. We missed the chief of Clutha, and our souls were sad.—I dreaded the departure of my fame; the pride of my valour rose.</P>
<P>SONS of Morven, I said, it is not thus our fathers fought. They rested not on the field of strangers, when the foe did not fall before them.—Their strength was like the eagles of heaven; their re∣nown is in the song. But our people fall by degrees, and our fame begins to depart.—What shall the king of Morven say, if Ossian conquers not at Teutha? Rise in your steel, ye warriors, and sollow the sound of Ossian's course. He will not return, but renowned, to the echoing walls of Selma.</P>
<P>MORNING rose on the blue waters of Teutha; Colmal stood before me in tears. She told of the chief of Clutha: and thrice the spear fell from her hand. My wrath turned against the stranger; for my soul trembled for Calthon.</P>
<P>SON of the feeble hand, I said, do Teutha's warriors fight with tears? The battle is not won with grief; nor dwells the sigh in the soul of war.—Go to the deer of Carmun, or the lowing herds of Teutha.—But leave these arms, thou son of fear; a warrior may lift them in battle.—</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="255"/>
I tore the mail from her shoulders. Her snowy breast appeared. She bent her red face to the ground.—I looked in silence to the chiefs. The spear fell from my hand; and the sigh of my bosom rose.—But when I heard the name of the maid, my crowding tears descended. I blessed the lovely beam of youth, and bade the battle move.—</P>
<P>WHY, son of the rock, should Ossian tell how Teutha's warriors died? They are now forgot in their land; and their tombs are not found on the heath.—Years came on with their tempests; and the green mounds mouldered away.—Scarce is the grave of Dunthalmo seen, or the place where he fell by the spear of Ossian.—Some gray warrior, half blind with age, sitting by night at the flaming oak of the hall, tells now my actions to his sons, and the fall of the dark Dunthalmo. The saces of youth bend sidelong towards his voice; surprize and joy burn in their eyes.—</P>
<P>I FOUND the son<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Calthon.</NOTE> of Rathmor bound to an oak; my sword cut the thongs from his hands. And I gave him the white-bosomed Colmal.—They dwelt in the halls of Teutha; and Ossian returned to Selma.</P>

<HEAD>LATHMON: A POEM<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lathmon a British prince, taking ad∣vantage of Fingal's absence in Ireland, made a descent on Morven, and advanced within sight of Selma the royal palace. Fingal arrived in the mean time, and Lath∣mon retreated to a hill, where his army was surprized by night, and himself taken prisoner by Ossian and Gaul the son of Morni. This exploit of Gaul and Ossian bears a near resemblance to the beautiful episode of Nisus and Euryalus in Virgil's ninth Aeneid. The poem opens, with the first appearance of Fingal on the coast of Morven, and ends, it may be supposed, about noon the next day. The first para∣graph is in a lyric measure, and appears to have been sung, of old, to the harp, as a prelude to the narrative part of the poem, which is in heroic verse.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>SELMA, thy halls are silent. There is no sound in the woods of Morven. The wave tumbles alone on the coast. The si∣lent beam of the sun is on the field. The daughters of Morven come forth, like the bow of the shower; they look towards green Ullin for the white sails of the king. He had promised to return, but the winds of the north arose.</P>
<P>WHO pours from the eastern hill, like a stream of darkness? It is the host of Lathmon. He has heard of the absence of Fingal. He trusts in the wind of the north. His soul brightens with joy. Why dost thou come, Lathmon? The mighty are not in Selma. Why comest thou with thy forward spear? Will the daughters of Morven fight? But stop, O mighty stream, in thy course! Does not Lathmon behold these sails? Why dost thou vanish, Lathmon,
<PB N="229" REF="257"/>
like the mist of the lake? But the squally storm is behind thee; Fingal pursues thy steps!</P>
<P>THE king of Morven started from sleep, as we rolled on the dark-blue wave. He stretched his hand to his spear, and his heroes rose around. We knew that he had seen his fathers, for they often de∣scended to his dreams, when the sword of the foe rose over the land; and the battle darkened before us.</P>
<P>WHITHER hast thou fled, O wind, said the king of Morven? Dost thou rustle in the chambers of the south, and pursue the shower in other lands? Why dost thou not come to my sails? to the blue face of my seas? The foe is in the land of Morven, and the king is absent. But let each bind on his mail, and each assume his shield. Stretch every spear over the wave; let every sword be un∣sheathed. Lathmon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is said, by tradition, that it was the intelligence of Lathmon's invasion, that occasioned Fingal's return from Ireland; though Ossion, more poetically, ascribes the cause of Fingal's knowledge to his dream.</NOTE> is before us with his host: he that fled<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">He alludes to a battle wherein Fingal had defeated Lathmon.

But he returns, like a collected stream, and his roar is between our hills.</P>
<P>SUCH were the words of Fingal. We rushed into Carmona's bay. Ossian ascended the hill; and thrice struck his bossy shield. The rock of Morven replied; and the bounding roes came forth. The foes were troubled in my presence: and collected their darken∣ed host; for I stood, like a cloud on the hill, rejoicing in the arma of my youth.</P>

MORNI<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Morni was chief of a numerous tribe, in the days of Fingal and his father Com∣hal. The last mentioned hero was killed in battle against Morni's tribe; but the valour and conduct of Fingal reduced them, at last, to obedience. We find the two heroes perfectly reconciled in this poem.</NOTE> sat beneath a tree, at the roaring waters of Strumon<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Stru'-moné, <HI>stream of the hill.</HI> Here the proper name of rivulet in the neigh∣bourhood of Selma.</NOTE>: his locks of age are gray: he leans forward on his staff; young Gaul is near the hero, hearing the battles of his youth. Often did he rise, in the fire of his soul, at the mighty deeds of Morni.</P>
<P>THE aged heard the sound of Ossian's shield: he knew the sign of battle. He started at once from his place. His gray hair part∣ed on his back. He remembers the actions of other years. My son, he said to fair haired Gaul, I hear the sound of battle. The king of Morven is returned, the sign of war is heard. Go to the halls of Strumon, and bring his arms to Morni. Bring the arms which my father wore in his age, for my arm begins to fail. Take thou thy armour, O Gaul; and rush to the first of thy battles. Let thine arm reach to the renown of thy fathers. Be thy course in the field, like the eagle's wing. Why shouldst thou fear death, my son! the valiant fall with fame; their shields turn the dark stream of danger away, and renown dwells on their gray hairs. Dost thou not see, O Gaul, how the steps of my age are honoured? Morni moves forth, and the young meet him, with reverence, and turn their eyes, with silent joy, on his course. But I never fled from danger, my son! my sword lightened through the darkness of battle. The stranger melted before me; the mighty were blasted in my presence.</P>
<P>GAUL brought the arms to Morni: the aged warrior covered him∣self with steel. He took the spear in his hand, which was often
<PB N="231" REF="259"/>
stained with the blood of the valiant. He came towards Fingal, his son attended his steps. The son of Comhal rejoiced over the warrior, when he came in the locks of his age.</P>
<P>KING of the roaring Strumon! said the rising joy of Fingal; do I behold thee in arms, after thy strength has failed? Often has Morni shone in battles, like the beam of the rising sun; when he disperses the storms of the hill, and brings peace to the glittering fields. But why didst thou not rest in thine age? Thy renown is in the song. The people behold thee, and bless the departure of mighty Morni. Why didst thou not rest in thine age? For the foe will vanish before Fingal.</P>
<P>SON of Comhal, replied the chief, the strength of Morni's arm has failed. I attempt to draw the sword of my youth, but it re∣mains in its place. I throw the spear, but it falls short of the mark; and I feel the weight of my shield. We decay, like the grass of the mountain, and our strength returns no more. I have a son, O Fingal, his soul has delighted in the actions of Morni's youth; but his sword has not been lifted against the foe, neither has his fame begun. I come with him to battle; to direct his arm. His re∣nown will be a sun to my soul, in the dark hour of my departure. O that the name of Morni were forgot among the people! that the heroes would only say, <Q REND="inline">"Behold the father of Gaul!"</Q></P>
<P>KING of Strumon, Fingal replied, Gaul shall lift the sword in battle. But he shall lift it before Fingal; my arm shall defend his youth. But rest thou in the halls of Selma; and hear of our renown. Bid the harp be strung; and the voice of the bard arise, that those who fall may rejoice in their fame; and the soul of Morni brighten with gladness.—Ossian! thou hast sought in
<PB N="232" REF="260"/>
battles: the blood of strangers is on thy spear: let thy course be with Gaul in the strife; but depart not from the side of Fingal; lest the foe find you alone, and your fame fail at once.</P>
<P>I SAW<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ossian speaks. The contrast between the old and young heroes is strongly mark∣ed. The circumstance of the latter's draw∣ing their swords is well imagined, and agrees with the impatience of young sol∣diers, just entered upon action.</NOTE> Gaul in his arms, and my soul was mixed with his: for the fire of the battle was in his eyes! he looked to the soe with joy.

<P>NIGHT came down on Morven. Fingal sat at the beam of the oak. Morni sat by his side with all his gray waving locks. Their discourse is of other times, and the actions of their fathers. Three bards, at times, touched the harp; and Ullin was near with his song. He sung of the mighty Comhal; but darkness gathered<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ullin had chosen ill the subject of his song. The <HI>darkness which gathered on Mor∣ni's brow,</HI> did not proceed from any dislike he had to Comhal's name, though they were foes, but from his fear that the song would awaken Fingal to remembrance of the feuds which had subsisted of old be∣tween the families. Fingal's speech on this occasion abounds with generosity and good sense.</NOTE> on Morni's brow. He rolled his red eye on Ullin; and the song of the bard ceased. Fingal observed the aged hero, and he mildly spoke.</P>
<P>CHIEF of Strumon, why that darkness? Let the days of other years be forgot. Our fathers contended in battle; but we meet to∣gether, at the feast. Our swords are turned on the foes, and they melt before us on the field. Let the days of our fathers be forgot, king of mossy Strumon.</P>

KING of Morven, replied the chief, I remember thy father with joy. He was terrible in battle; the rage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This expression is ambiguous in the original. It either signifies that Comhal killed many in battle, or that he was im∣placable in his resentment. The transla∣tor has endeavoured to preserve the same ambiguity in the version; as it was pro∣bably designed by the poet.</NOTE> of the chief was deadly. My eyes were full of tears, when the king of heroes sell. The va∣liant fall, O Fingal, and the feeble remain on the hills. How many heroes have passed away, in the days of Morni! And I did not shun the battle; neither did I fly from the strife of the valiant.</P>
<P>Now let the friends of Fingal rest; for the night is around; that they may rise, with strength, to battle against car-borne Lathmon. I hear the sound of his host, like thunder heard on a distant heath. Ossian! and fair-haired Gaul! ye are swift in the race. Observe the foes of Fingal from that woody hill. But approach them not, your fathers are not near to shield you. Let not your fame fall at once. The valour of youth may fail.</P>
<P>WE heard the words of the chief with joy, and moved in the clang of our arms. Our steps are on the woody hill. Heaven burns with all its stars. The meteors of death fly over the field. The distant noise of the foe reached our ears. It was then Gaul spoke, in his valour; his hand half-unsheathed the sword.</P>
<P>SON of Fingal, he said, why burns the soul of Gaul? My heart beats high. My steps are disordered; and my hand trembles on my sword. When I look towards the foe, my soul lightens before me, and I see their sleeping host. Tremble thus the souls of the valiant in battles of the spear?—How would the soul of Morni rise if we
<PB N="234" REF="262"/>
should rush on the foe! Our renown would grow in the song; and our steps be stately in the eyes of the brave.</P>
<P>SON of Morni, I replied, my soul delights in battle. I delight to shine in battle alone, and to give my name to the bards. But what if the foe should prevail; shall I behold the eyes of the king? They are terrible in his displeasure, and like the flames of death.—But I will not behold them in his wrath. Ossian shall prevail or fall. But shall the fame of the vanquished rise?—They pass away like a shadow. But the fame of Ossian shall rise. His deeds shall be like his fathers. Let us rush in our arms; son of Morni, let us rush to battle. Gaul! if thou shalt return, go to Selma's lofty wall. Tell to Evirallin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ossian had married her a little time before. The story of his courtship of this lady is introduced, as an episode, in the fourth book of Fingal.</NOTE> that I fell with fame; carry this sword to Branno's daughter. Let her give it to Oscar, when the years of his youth shall arise.</P>
<P>SON of Fingal, Gaul replied with a sigh; will I return after Os∣sian is low!—What would my father say, and Fingal king of men? The feeble would turn their eyes and say, <Q REND="inline">"Behold the mighty Gaul who left his friend in his blood!"</Q> Ye shall not behold me, ye feeble, but in the midst of my renown. Ossian! I have heard from my father the mighty deeds of heroes; their mighty deeds when alone; for the soul increases in danger.</P>
<P>SON of Morni, I replied and strode before him on the heath, our fathers shall praise our valour, when they mourn our fall. A beam of gladness shall rise on their souls, when their eyes are full of tears. They will say, <Q REND="inline">"Our sons have not fallen like the grass of the field, for they spread death around them."</Q>—But why
<PB N="235" REF="263"/>
should we think of the narrow house? The sword defends the va∣liant. But death pursues the flight of the feeble; and their re∣nown is not heard.</P>
<P>WE rushed forward through night; and came to the roar of a stream which bent its blue course round the foe, through trees that ecchoed to its noise; we came to the bank of the stream, and saw the sleeping host. Their fires were decayed on the plain; and the lonely steps of their scouts were distant far. I stretched my spear before me to support my steps over the stream. But Gaul took my hand, and spoke the words of the valiant.</P>
<P>SHALL<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This proposal of Gaul is much more noble, and more agreeable to true heroism, than the behaviour of Ulysses and Dio∣med in the Iliad, or that of Nisus and Eu∣ryalus in the Aeneid.

For the enemy be∣ing dismayed with the sound of Ossian's shield, which was the common signal of battle, thought that Fingal's whole army came to attack them; so that they fly in reality from an army, not from two he∣roes; which reconciles the story to pro∣bability.</NOTE> the son of Fingal rush on a sleeping foe? Shall he come like a blast by night when it overturns the young trees in secret? Fingal did not thus receive his fame, nor dwells renown on the gray hairs of Morni, for actions like these.

<P>MY soul rejoiced over the warrior, and my bursting tears de∣scended. And the foe shall meet Gaul, I said: the fame of Morni's son shall arise. But rush not too far, my hero: let the gleam of thy steel be near to Ossian. Let our hands join in slaughter.—Gaul! dost thou not behold that rock? Its gray side dimly gleams to the stars. If the foe shall prevail, let our back be towards the

rock. Then shall they fear to approach our spears; for death is in our hands.</P>
<P>I STRUCK thrice my ecchoing shield. The starting foe arose. We rushed on in the sound of our arms. Their crouded steps fly over the heath; for they thought that the mighty Fingal came; and the strength of their arms withered away. The sound of their flight was like that of flame, when it rushes thro' the blasted groves.</P>
<P>IT was then the spear of Gaul flew in its strength; it was then his sword arose. Cremor fell; and mighty Leth. Dunthormo struggled in his blood. The steel rushed through Crotho's side, as bent, he rose on his spear; the black stream poured from the wound, and hissed on the half-extinguished oak. Cathmin saw the steps of the hero behind him, and ascended a blasted tree; but the spear pierced him from behind. Shrieking, panting, he fell; moss and withered branches pursue his fall, and strew the blue arms of Gaul.</P>
<P>SUCH were thy deeds, son of Morni, in the first of thy battles. Nor slept the sword by thy side, thou last of Fingal's race! Ossian rushed forward in his strength, and the people fell before him; as the grass by the staff of the boy, when he whistles along the field, and the gray beard of the thistle falls. But careless the youth moves on; his steps are towards the desart.</P>
<P>GRAY morning rose around us, the winding streams are bright along the heath. The foe gathered on a hill; and the rage of Lath∣mon rose. He bent the red eye of his wrath: he is silent in his rising grief. He often struck his bossy shield; and his steps are un∣equal on the heath. I saw the distant darkness of the hero, and I spoke to Morni's son.</P>

The custom of depreciating ene∣mies is not altogether one of the refine∣ments of modern heroism. This railing disposition is one of the capital faults in Homer's characters, which, by the bye, cannot be imputed to the poet, who kept to the manners of the times of which he wrote.

<P>Go thou to the heroes, chief of Dutha, for I behold the stately steps of Ossian. His fame is worthy of my steel; let him fight with Lathmon.</P>
<P>THE noble Sulmath came. I rejoiced in the words of the king. I raised the shield on my arm; and Gaul placed in my hand the sword of Morni. We returned to the murmuring stream; Lath∣mon came in his strength. His dark host rolled, like the clouds, be∣hind him: but the son of Nuäth was bright in his steel.</P>
<P>SON of Fingal, said the hero, thy fame has grown on our fall. How many lie there of my people by thy hand, thou king of men! Lift now thy spear against Lathmon; and lay the son of Nuäth low. Lay him low among his people, or thou thyself must fall.
<PB N="239" REF="267"/>
It shall never be told in my halls that my warriors fell in my pre∣sence; that they fell in the presence of Lathmon when his sword rested by his side: the blue eyes of Cutha<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cutha appears to have been Lathmon's wife or mistress.</NOTE> would roll in tears, and her steps be lonely in the vales of Dunlathmon.</P>
<P>NEITHER shall it be told, I replied, that the son of Fingal fled. Were his steps covered with darkness, yet would not Ossian fly; his soul would meet him and say, <Q REND="inline">"Does the bard of Selma fear the foe?"</Q> No: he does not fear the foe. His joy is in the midst of battle.</P>
<P>LATHMON came on with his spear, and pierced the shield of Ossian. I felt the cold steel at my side; and drew the swored of Morni; I cut the spear in twain; the bright point fell glittering on the ground. The son of Nuäth burnt in his wrath, and lifted high his sounding shield. His dark eyes rolled above it, as bending for∣ward, it shone like a gate of brass. But Ossian's spear pierced the brightness of its bosses, and sunk in a tree that rose behind. The shield hung on the quivering lance! but Lathmon still advanced. Gaul foresaw the fall of the chief, and stretched his buckler before my sword; when it descended, in a stream of light over the king of Dunlathmon.</P>
<P>LATHMON beheld the son of Morni, and the tear started from his eye. He threw the sword of his fathers on the ground, and spoke the words of the valiant. Why should Lathmon fight against the first of mortal men? Your souls are beams from heaven; your swords the flames of death. Who can equal the renown of the heroes, whose actions are so great in youth! O that ye were in the halls of Nuäth, in the green dwelling of Lathmon! then would my father say, that his son did not yield to the feeble.—But who comes, a

<P>FINGAL came, in his mildness, rejoicing in secret over the actions of his son. Morni's face brightened with gladness, and his aged eyes look faintly through the tears of joy. We came to the halls of Selma, and sat round the feast of shells. The maids of the song came into our presence, and the mildly blushing Evirallin. Her dark hair spreads on her neck of snow, her eye rolled in secret on Ossian; she touched the harp of music, and we blessed the daughter of Branno.</P>
<P>FINGAL rose in his place, and spoke to Dunlathmon's battling king. The sword of Trenmor trembled by his side, as he lifted up his mighty arm. Son of Nuäth, he said, why dost thou search for fame in Morven? We are not of the race of the feeble; nor do our swords gleam over the weak. When did we come to Dunlathmon, with the sound of war? Fingal does not delight in battle, though his arm is strong. My renown grows on the fall of the haughty. The lightning of my steel pours on the proud in arms. The battle comes; and the tombs of the valiant rise; the tombs of my people rise, O my fathers! and I at last must remain alone. But I will remain re∣nowned, and the departure of my soul shall be one stream of light. Lathmon! retire to thy place. Turn thy battles to other lands. The race of Morven are renowned, and their foes are the sons of the unhappy.</P>

<HEAD>OITHÓNA: A POEM<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Gaul, the son of Morni, attended Lathmon into his own country, after his being defeated in Morven, as related in the preceding poem. He was kindly en∣tertained by Nuäth, the father of Lath∣mon, and fell in love with his daughter Oithona.—The lady was no less ena∣moured of Gaul, and a day was fixed for their marriage. In the mean time Fingal, pre∣paring for an expedition into the country of the Britons, sent for Gaul. He obeyed, and went; but not without promising to Oithona to return, if he survived the war, by a cer∣tain day.—Lathmon too was obliged to attend his father Nuäth in his wars, and Oithona was left alone at Dunlathmon, the seat of the family.—Dunrommath, lord of Uthal, supposed to be one of the Ork∣neys, taking advantage of the absence of her friends, came and carried off, by force, Oithona, who had formerly reject∣ed his love, into Tromáthon, a desart island, where he concealed her in a cave.</P>
<P>Gaul returned on the day appointed; heard of the rape, and sailed to Tromá∣thon, to revenge himself on Dunrom∣math. When he landed, he found Oi-thona disconsolate, and resolved not to survive the loss of her honour.—She told him the story of her misfortunes, and she scarce ended, when Dunrommath, with his followers, appeared at the further end of the island. Gaul prepared to attack him, recommending to Oithona to retire, till the battle was over.—She seemingly obeyed; but she secretly armed herself, rush∣ed into the thickest of the battle, and was mortally wounded.—Gaul pursuing the flying enemy, found her just expiring on the field: he mourned over her, raised her tomb, and returned to Morven.—Thus is the story handed down by tradi∣tion; nor is it given with any material difference in the poem, which opens with Gaul's return to Dunlathmon, after the rape of Oithona.</P></NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>DARKNESS dwells around Dunlathmon, though the moon shews half her face on the hill. The daughter of night turns her eyes away; for she beholds the grief that is coming.—The son of Morni is on the plain; but there is no sound in the hall.

<P>WHITHER art thou gone in thy beauty, dark-haired daughter of Nuäth? Lathmon is in the field of the valiant, but thou didst pro∣mise to remain in the hall; thou didst promise to remain in the hall till the son of Morni returned. Till he returned from Strumon, to the maid of his love. The tear was on thy cheek at his departure; the sigh rose in secret in thy breast. But thou dost not come to meet him, with songs, with the lightly-trembling sound of the harp.—</P>
<P>SUCH were the words of Gaul, when he came to Dunlathmon's towers. The gates were open and dark. The winds were bluster∣ing in the hall. The trees strowed the threshold with leaves; and the murmur of night is abroad.—Sad and silent, at a rock, the son of Morni sat: his soul trembled for the maid; but he knew not
<PB N="243" REF="271"/>
whither to turn his course. The son<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Morlo, the son of Leth, is one of Fingal's most famous heroes.

But he did not raise his voice, for he saw the sorrow of Gaul.</P>
<P>SLEEP descended on the heroes. The visions of night arose. Oithona stood in a dream, before the eyes of Morni's son. Her dark hair was loose and disordered: her lovely eye rolled in tears. Blood stained her snowy arm. The robe half hid the wound of her breast. She stood over the chief, and her voice was heard.</P>
<P>SLEEPS the son of Morni, he that was lovely in the eyes of Oithona? Sleeps Gaul at the distant rock, and the daughter of Nuäth low? The sea rolls round the dark isle of Tromáthon; I sit in my tears in the cave. Nor do I sit alone, O Gaul, the dark chief of Cuthal is there. He is there in the rage of his love.—And what can Oithona do?</P>
<P>A ROUGHER blast rushed through the oak. The dream of night departed. Gaul took his aspen spear; he stood in the rage of wrath.

its rocks; sad Oithona sat on the coast. She looked on the rolling waters, and her tears descend.—But when she saw Gaul in his arms, she started and turned her eyes away. Her lovely cheek is bent and red; her white arm trembles by her side.—Thrice she strove to fly from his presence; but her steps failed her as she went.</P>
<P>DAUGHTER of Nuäth, said the hero, why dost thou fly from Gaul? Do my eyes send forth the flame of death? Or darkens hatred in my soul? Thou art to me the beam of the east rising in a land unknown. But thou coverest thy face with sadness, daughter of high Dunlathmon! Is the foe of Oithona near? My soul burns to meet him in battle. The sword trembles on the side of Gaul, and longs to glitter in his hand.—Speak, daughter of Nuäth, dost thou not behold my tears?</P>
<P>CAR-BORNE chief of Strumon, replied the sighing maid, why comest thou over the dark-blue wave to Nuäth's mournful daughter? Why did I not pass away in secret, like the flower of the rock, that lifts its fair head unseen, and strows its withered leaves on the blast? Why didst thou come, O Gaul, to hear my departing sigh? I pass away in my youth; and my name shall not be heard. Or it will be heard with sorrow, and the tears of Nuäth will fall. Thou wilt be sad, son of Morni, for the fallen fame of Oithona. But she shall sleep in the narrow tomb, far from the voice of the mourner.—Why didst thou come, chief of Strumon, to the sea-beat rocks of Tromathon.</P>
<P>I CAME to meet thy foes, daughter of car-borne Nuäth! the death of Cuthal's chief darkens before me; or Morni's son shall fall.—Oithona! when Gaul is low, raise my tomb on that oozy rock; and
<PB N="245" REF="273"/>
when the dark-bounding ship shall pass, call the sons of the sea; call them, and give this sword, that they may carry it to Morni's hall; that the grey-haired hero may cease to look towards the desart for the return of his son.</P>
<P>AND shall the daughter of Nuäth live, she replied with a bursting sigh? Shall I live in Tromáthon, and the son of Morni low? My heart is not of that rock; nor my soul careless as that sea, which lifts its blue waves to every wind, and rolls beneath the storm. The blast which shall lay thee low, shall spread the branches of Oithona on earth. We shall wither together, son of car-borne Morni!—The narrow house is pleasant to me, and the gray stone of the dead: for never more will I leave thy rocks, sea-surrounded Tromáthon!—Night<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Oithona relates how she was carried away by Dunrommath.</NOTE> came on with her clouds, after the departure of Lathmon, when he went to the wars of his fathers, to the moss-covered rock of Duthórmoth; night came on, and I sat in the hall, at the beam of the oak. The wind was abroad in the trees. I heard the sound of arms. Joy rose in my face; for I thought of thy return. It was the chief of Cuthal, the red-haired strength of Dunrommath. His eyes rolled in fire: the blood of my people was on his sword. They who defended Oithona fell by the gloomy chief.—What could I do? My arm was weak; it could not lift the spear. He took me in my grief, amidst my tears he raised the sail. He feared the returning strength of Lathmon, the brother of unhappy Oithona.—But behold, he comes with his people! the dark wave is divided before him!—Whither wilt thou turn thy steps, son of Morni? Many are the warriors of Dun∣rommath!</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="274"/>
MY steps never turned from battle, replied the hero, as he un∣sheathed his sword; and will I begin to fear, Oithona, when thy foes are near? Go to thy cave, daughter of Nuath, till our battle cease. Son of Leth, bring the bows of our fathers; and the sound∣ing quiver of Morni. Let our three warriors bend the yew. Our selves will lift the spear. They are an host on the rock; but our souls are strong.</P>
<P>THE daughter of Nuäth went to the cave: a troubled joy rose on her mind, like the red path of the lightning on a stormy cloud.—Her soul was resolved, and the tear was dried from her wildly∣looking eye.—Dunrommath slowly approached; for he saw the son of Morni. Contempt contracted his face, a smile is on his dark-brown cheek; his red eye rolled, half-conceal'd, beneath his shaggy brows.</P>
<P>WHENCE are the sons of the sea, begun the gloomy chief? Have the winds driven you to the rocks of Tromáthon? Or come you in search of the white-handed daughter of Nuäth? The sons of the unhappy, ye feeble men, come to the hand of Dunrommath. His eye spares not the weak; and he delights in the blood of strangers. Oithona is a beam of light, and the chief of Cuthal enjoys it in secret; wouldst thou come on its loveliness like a cloud, son of the feeble hand!—Thou mayst come, but shalt thou return to the halls of thy fathers?</P>
<P>DOST thou not know me, said Gaul, red-haired chief of Cuthal? Thy feet were swift on the heath, in the battle of car-borne Lath∣mon; when the sword of Morni's son pursued his host, in Morven's woody land. Dunrommath! thy words are mighty, for thy warriors
<PB N="247" REF="275"/>
gather behind thee. But do I fear them, son of pride? I am not of the race of the feeble.</P>
<P>GAUL advanced in his arms; Dunrommath shrunk behind his people. But the spear of Gaul pierced the gloomy chief, and his sword lopped off his head, as it bended in death.—The son of Morni shook it thrice by the lock; the warriors of Dunrommath fled. The arrows of Morven pursued them: ten fell on the mossy rocks. The rest lift the sounding sail, and bound on the eccho∣ing deep.</P>
<P>GAUL advanced towards the cave of Oithona. He beheld a youth leaning against a rock. An arrow had pierced his side; and his eye rolled faintly beneath his helmet.—The soul of Morni's son is sad, he came and spoke the words of peace.</P>
<P>CAN the hand of Gaul heal thee, youth of the mournful brow? I have searched for the herbs of the mountains; I have gathered them on the secret banks of their streams. My hand has closed the wound of the valiant, and their eyes have blessed the son of Morni. Where dwelt thy fathers, warrior? Were they of the sons of the mighty? Sadness shall come, like night, on thy native streams; for thou art fallen in thy youth.—</P>
<P>MY fathers, replied the stranger, were of the sons of the mighty; but they shall not be sad; for my fame is departed like morning mist. High walls rise on the banks of Duvranna; and see their mossy towers in the stream; a rock ascends behind them with its bending firs. Thou mayst behold it far distant. There my bro∣ther dwells. He is renowned in battle: give him this glitter∣ing helmet.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="276"/>
THE helmet fell from the hand of Gaul; for it was the wounded Oithona. She had armed herself in the cave, and came in search of death. Her heavy eyes are half closed; the blood pours from her side.—</P>
<P>SON of Morni, she said, prepare the narrow tomb. Sleep comes, like a cloud, on my soul. The eyes of Oithona are dim. O had I dwelt at Duvranna, in the bright beam of my fame! then had my years come on with joy; and the virgins would bless my steps. But I fall in youth, son of Morni, and my father shall blush in his hall.—</P>
<P>SHE fell pale on the rock of Tromáthon. The mournful hero raised her tomb.—He came to Morven; but we saw the darkness of his soul. Ossian took the harp in the praise of Oithona. The brightness of the face of Gaul returned. But his sigh rose, at times, in the midst of his friends, like blasts that shake their unfrequent wings, after the stormy winds are laid.</P>

<HEAD>CROMA: A POEM<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Malvina the daughter of Toscar is overheard by Ossian lamenting the death of Oscar her lover. Ossian, to divert her grief, relates his own actions in an ex edi∣tion which he undertook, at Fingal's com∣mand, to aid Crothar the petty king of Croma, a country in Ireland, against Roth∣mar who invaded his dominions. The story is delivered down thus in tradition. Crothar king of Croma being blind with age, and his son too young for the field, Rothmar the chief of Tromlo resolved to avail himself of the opportunity offered of annexing the dominions of Crothar to his own. He accordingly marched into the country subject to Crothar, but which he held of Arth or Artho, who was, at the time, supreme king of Ireland.</P>
<P>Crothar being, on account of his age and blindness, unfit for action, sent for aid to Fingal king of Scotland; who ordered his son Ossian to the relief of Crothar. But before his arrival Fovar-gormo, the son of Crothar, attacking Roth∣mar, was slain himself, and his forces to∣tally defeated. Ossian renewed the war; came to battle, killed Rothmar, and rout∣ed his army. Croma being thus delivered of its enemies, Ossian returned to Scot∣land.</P></NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>IT was the voice of my love! few are his visits to the dreams of Malvina! Open your airy halls, ye fathers of mighty Toscar. Unfold the gates of your clouds; the steps of Malvina's departure are near. I have heard a voice in my dream. I feel the fluttering of my soul. Why didst thou come, O blast, from the dark-rolling of the lake? Thy rustling wing was in the trees, the dream of Mal∣vina departed. But she beheld her love, when his robe of mist flew on the wind; the beam of the sun was on his skirts, they glit∣tered like the gold of the stranger. It was the voice of my love! few are his visits to my dreams!</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="278"/>
BUT thou dwellest in the soul of Malvina, son of mighty Ossian. My sighs arise with the beam of the east; my tears descend with the drops of night. I was a lovely tree, in thy presence, Oscar, with all my branches round me; but thy death came like a blast from the desart, and laid my green head low; the spring returned with its showers, but no leaf of mine arose. The virgins saw me silent in the hall, and they touched the harp of joy. The tear was on the cheek of Malvina: the virgins beheld me in my grief. Why art thou sad, they said; thou first of the maids of Lutha? Was he lovely as the beam of the morning, and stately in thy sight?</P>
<P>PLEASANT is thy song in Ossian's ear, daughter of streamy Lu∣tha! Thou hast heard the music of departed bards in the dream of thy rest, when sleep fell on thine eyes, at the murmur of Moruth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mor'-ruth, <HI>great stream.</HI></NOTE>. When thou didst return from the chace, in the day of the sun, thou hast heard the music of the bards, and thy song is lovely. It is lovely, O Malvina, but it melts the soul. There is a joy in grief when peace dwells in the breast of the sad. But sorrow wastes the mournful, O daughter of Toscar, and their days are few. They fall away, like the flower on which the sun looks in his strength after the mildew has passed over it, and its head is heavy with the drops of night. Attend to the tale of Ossian, O maid; he remem∣bers the days of his youth.</P>
<P>THE king commanded; I raised my sails, and rushed into the bay of Croma; into Croma's sounding bay in lovely Inisfail<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Inisfail,</HI> one of the ancient names of Ireland.</NOTE>. High on the coast arose the towers of Crothar king of spears; Crothar renowned in the battles of his youth; but age dwelt then around the chief. Rothmar raised the sword against the hero; and the

wrath of Fingal burned. He sent Ossian to meet Rothmar in battle, for the chief of Croma was the companion of his youth.</P>
<P>I SENT the bard before me with songs; I came into the hall of Crothar. There sat the hero amidst the arms of his fathers, but his eyes had failed. His gray locks waved around a staff, on which the warrior leaned. He hummed the song of other times, when the sound of our arms reached his ears. Crothar rose, stretched his aged hand and blessed the son of Fingal.</P>
<P>OSSIAN! said the hero, the strength of Crothar's arm has failed. O could I list the sword, as on the day that Fingal fought at Stru∣tha! He was the first of mortal men; but Crothar had also his fame. The king of Morven praised me, and he placed on my arm the bossy shield of Calthar, whom the hero had slain in war. Dost thou not behold it on the wall, for Crothar's eyes have failed? Is thy strength, like thy fathers, Ossian? let the aged feel thine arm.</P>
<P>I GAVE my arm to the king; he seels it with his aged hands. The sigh rose in his breast, and his tears descended. Thou art strong, my son, he said, but not like the king of Morven. But who is like the hero among the mighty in war! Let the feast of my halls be spread; and let my bards raise the song. Great is he that is within my walls, sons of ecchoing Croma!</P>
<P>THE feast is spread. The harp is heard; and joy is in the hall. But it was joy covering a sigh, that darkly dwelt in every breast. It was like the faint beam of the moon spread on a cloud in heaven. At length the music ceased, and the aged king of Croma spoke; he spoke without a tear, but the sigh swelled in the midst of his voice.</P>

SON of Fingal! dost thou not behold the darkness of Crothar's hall of shells? My soul was not dark at the feast, when my people lived. I rejoiced in the presence of strangers, when my son shone in the hall. But, Ossian, he is a beam that is departed, and left no streak of light behind. He is fallen, son of Fingal, in the battles of his father.—Rothmar the chief of grassy Tromlo heard that my eyes had sailed; he heard that my arms were fixed in the hall, and the pride of his soul arose. He came towards Croma; my people fell before him. I took my arms in the hall, but what could sight∣less Crothar do? My steps were unequal; my grief was great. I wished for the days that were past. Days! wherein I fought; and won in the field of blood. My son returned from the chace; the fair-haired Fovar-gormo<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Faobhar-gorm, <HI>the blue point of steel.</HI></NOTE>. He had not lifted his sword in battle, for his arm was young. But the soul of the youth was great; the fire of valour burnt in his eyes. He saw the disordered steps of his father, and his sigh arose. King of Croma, he said, is it because thou hast no son; is it for the weakness of Fovar-gormo's arm that thy sighs arise? I begin, my father, to feel the strength of my arm; I have drawn the sword of my youth; and I have bent the bow. Let me meet this Rothmar, with the youths of Croma: let me meet him, O my father; for I feel my burning soul.</P>
<P>AND thou shalt meet him, I said, son of the sightless Crothar! But let others advance before thee, that I may hear the tread of thy feet at thy return; for my eyes behold thee not, fair-haired Fovar-gormo!—He went, he met the foe; he fell. The foe advances towards Croma. He who slew my son is near, with all his pointed spears.</P>
<P>IT is not time to fill the shell, I replied, and took my spear. My people saw the fire of my eyes, and they rose around. All night we
<PB N="253" REF="281"/>
strode along the heath. Gray morning rose in the east. A green narrow vale appeared before us; nor did it want its blue stream. The dark host of Rothmar are on its banks, with all their glittering arms. We fought along the vale; they fled; Rothmar sunk be∣neath my sword. Day had not descended in the west when I brought his arms to Crothar. The aged hero felt them with his hands; and joy brightened in his soul.</P>
<P>THE people gather to the hall; the shells of the feast are heard. Ten harps are strung; five bards advance, and sing, by turns,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Those extempore compositions were in great repute among succeeding bards. The pieces extant of that kind shew more of the good ear, than of the poetical genius of their authors. The translator has only met with one poem of this sort, which he thinks worthy of being preserved. It is a thousand years later than Ossian, but the authors seem to have observed his manner, and adopted some of his expressions. The story of it is this. Five bards, passing the night in the house of a chief, who was a poet himself, went severally to make their observations on, and returned with an extempore description of, night. The night happened to be one in October, as appears from the poem, and in the north of Scotland, it has all that variety which the bards ascribe to it, in their descriptions.
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>FIRST BARD.</SPEAKER>
<P>NIGHT is dull and dark. The clouds rest on the hills. No star with green trembling beam; no moon looks from the sky. I hear the blast in the wood; but I hear it distant sar. The stream of the valley murmurs; but its murmur is fullen and sad. From the tree at the grave of the dead the long-howling owl is heard. I see a dim form on the plain!—It is a ghost!—it fades—it flies. Some funeral shall pass this way: the meteor marks the path.</P>
<P>The distant dog is howling from the hut of the hill. The stag lies on the mountain moss: the hind is at his side. She hears the wind in his branchy horns. She starts, but lies again.</P>
<P>The roe is in the cleft of the rock; the heath-cock's head is beneath his wing. No beast, no bird is abroad, but the owl and the howling fox. She on a leafless tree: he in a cloud on the hill.</P>
<P>Dark, panting, trembling, sad the tra∣veller has lost his way. Through shrubs, through thorns, he goes, along the gur∣gling rill. He fears the rock and the fen. He fears the ghost of night. The old tree groans to the blast; the falling branch re∣sounds. The wind drives the withered burs, clung together, along the grass. It is the light tread of a ghost!—He trembles amidst the night.</P>
<P>Dark, dusky, howling is night, cloudy, windy, and full of ghosts! The dead are abroad! my friends, receive me from the night.</P>
</SP><SP>
<SPEAKER>SECOND BARD.</SPEAKER>
<P>The wind is up. The shower descends. The spirit of the mountain shrieks. Woods fall from high. Windows flap. The grow∣ing river roars. The traveller attempts the ford. Hark that shriek! he dies:—The storm drives the horse from the hill, the goat, the lowing cow. They tremble as drives the shower, beside the moulder∣ing bank.</P>
<P>The hunter starts from sleep, in his lonely hut; he wakes the fire decayed. His wet dogs smoke around him. He fills the chinks with heath. Loud roar two moun∣tain streams which meet beside his booth.</P>
<P>Sad on the side of a hill the wandering shepherd sits. The tree resounds above him. The stream roars down the rock. He waits for the rising moon to guide him to his home.</P>
<P>Ghosts ride on the storm to-night. Sweet is their voice between the squalls of wind. Their songs are of other worlds.</P>
<P>The rain is past. The dry wind blows. Streams roar, and windows flap. Cold drops fall from the roof. I see the starry sky. But the shower gathers again. The west is gloomy and dark. Night is stormy and dismal; receive me, my friends, from night.</P>
</SP><SP>
<SPEAKER>THIRD BARD.</SPEAKER>
<P>The wind still sounds between the hills: and whistles through the grass of the rock. The firs fall from their place. The turfy hut is torn. The clouds, divided, fly over the sky, and shew the burning stars. The meteor, token of death! flies sparkling through the gloom. It rests on the hill. I see the withered fern, the dark browed rock, the fallen oak. Who is that in his shrowd beneath the tree, by the stream?</P>
<P>The waves dark-tumble on the lake, and lash its rocky sides. The boat is brim∣full in the cove; the oars on the rocking tide. A maid sits sad beside the rock, and eyes the rolling stream. Her lover pro∣mised to come. She saw his boat, when yet it was light, on the lake. Is this his broken boat on the shore? Are these his groans on the wind?</P>
<P>Hark! the hail rattles around. The flaky snow descends. The tops of the hills are white. The stormy winds abate. Va∣rious is the night and cold; receive me, my friends, from night.</P>
</SP><SP>
<SPEAKER>FOURTH BARD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Night is calm and fair; blue, starry, settled is night. The winds, with the clouds, are gone. They sink behind the hill. The moon is up on the mountain. Trees glister: streams shine on the rock. Bright rolls the settled lake; bright the stream of the vale.</P>
<P>I see the trees overturned; the shocks of corn on the plain. The wakeful hind rebuilds the shocks, and whistles on the distant field.</P>
<P>Calm, settled, fair is night!—Who comes from the place of the dead? That form with the robe of snow; white arms and dark-brown hair! It is the daughter of the chief of the people; she that lately fell! Come, let us view thee, O maid! thou that hast been the delight of heroes! The blast drives the phantom away; white, without form, it ascends the hill.</P>
<P>The breezes drive the blue mist, slowly over the narrow vale. It rises on the hill, and joins its head to heaven.—Night is settled, calm, blue, starry, bright with the moon. Receive me not, my friends, for lovely is the night.</P>
</SP><SP>
<SPEAKER>FIFTH BARD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Night is calm, but dreary. The moon is in a cloud in the west. Slow moves that pale beam along the shaded hill. The di∣stant wave is heard. The torrent murmurs on the rock. The cock is heard from the booth. More than half the night is past. The house-wise, groping in the gloom, re∣kindles the settled fire. The hunter thinks that day approaches, and calls his bound∣ing dogs. He ascends the hill and whistles on his way. A blast removes the cloud. He sees the starry plough of the north. Much of the night is to pass. He nods by the mossy rock.</P>
<P>Hark! the whirlwind is in the wood! A low murmur in the vale! It is the mighty army of the dead returning from the air.</P>
<P>The moon rests behind the hill. The beam is still on that lofty rock. Long are the shadows of the trees. Now it is dark over all. Night is dreary, silent, and dark; receive me, my friends, from night.</P>
</SP><SP>
<SPEAKER>THE CHIEF.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let clouds rest on the hills: spirits fly and travellers fear. Let the winds of the woods arise, the sounding storms descend. Roar streams and windows flap, and green winged meteors fly; rise the pale moon from behind her hills, or inclose her head in clouds; night is alike to me, blue, stor∣my, or gloomy the sky. Night flies before the beam, when it is poured on the hill. The young day returns from his clouds but we return no more.</P>
<P>Where are our chiefs of old? Where our kings of mighty name? The fields of their battles are silent. Scarce their mossy tombs remain. We shall also be forgot. This lofty house shall fall. Our sons shall not behold the ruins in grass. They shall ask of the aged, <Q REND="inline">"Where stood the walls of our fathers?"</Q></P>
<P>Raise the song, and strike the harp; send round the shells of joy. Suspend a hundred tapers on high. Youths and maids begin the dance. Let some gray bard be near me to tell the deeds of other times; of kings renowned in our land, of chiefs we behold no more. Thus let the night pass until morning shall appear in our halls. Then let the bow be at hand, the dogs, the youths of the chace. We shall ascend the hill with day; and awake the deer.</P>
</SP></Q></NOTE>, the praise of Ossian; they poured forth their burning souls, and the harp answered to their voice. The joy of Croma was great: for peace returned to the land. The night came on with silence, and the morning returned with joy. No foe came in darkness, with
<PB N="254" REF="282"/>
his glittering spear. The joy of Croma was great; for the gloomy Rothmar fell.</P>
<P>I RAISED my voice for Fovar-gormo, when they laid the chief in earth. The aged Crothar was there, but his sigh was not heard. He searched for the wound of his son, and found it in his breast. Joy rose in the face of the aged. He came and spoke to Ossian.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="283"/>
KING of spears! he said, my son has not fallen without his fame. The young warrior did not fly; but met death, as he went forward in his strength. Happy are they who die in youth, when their re∣nown is heard! The seeble will not behold them in the hall; or smile at their trembling hands. Their memory shall be honour∣ed in the song; the young tear of the virgin falls. But the aged
<PB N="256" REF="284"/>
wither away, by degrees, and the fame of their youth begins to be forgot. They fall in secret; the sigh of their son is not heard. Joy is around their tomb; and the stone of their fame is placed with∣out a tear. Happy are they who die in youth, when their renown is around them!</P>

<HEAD>BERRATHON: A POEM<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This poem is reputed to have been composed by Ossian, a little time before his death; and consequently it is known in tradition by no other name than <HI>Ossian's last hymn.</HI> The translator has taken the liberty to call it <HI>Berrathon,</HI> from the episode concerning the re-establishment of Larth∣mor king of that island, after he had been dethroned by his own son Uthal. Fingal in his voyage to Lochlin [Fing. B. III.] whither he had been invited by Starno the father of Agandecca, so often mentioned in Ossian's poems, touched at Berrathon, an island of Scandinavia, where he was kindly entertained by Larthmor the petty king of the place, who was a vassal of the supreme kings of Lochlin. The hospitality of Larth∣mor gained him Fingal's friendship, which that hero manifested, after the imprisonment of Larthmor by his own son, by sending Ossian and Toscar, the father of Malvina so often mentioned, to rescue Larthmor, and to punish the unnatural behaviour of Uthal. Uthal was handsome to a proverb, and consequently much admired by the ladies. Nina-thoma the beautiful daughter of Tor∣thóma, a neighbouring prince, fell in love and fled with him. He proved unconstant; for another lady, whose name is not men∣tioned, gaining his affections, he confined Nina-thoma to a desart island near the coast of Berrathon. She was relieved by Ossian, who, in company with Toscar, landing on Berrathon, defeated the forces of Uthal, and killed him in a single combat. Nina-thoma, whose love not all the bad behaviour of Uthal could erase, hearing of his death, died of grief. In the mean time Larthmor is restored, and Ossian and Toscar returned in triumph to Fingal.</P>
<P>The present poem opens with an elegy on the death of Malvina the daughter of Toscar, and closes with presages of the poet's death. It is almost altogether in a lyric measure, and has that melancholy air which distinguishes the remains of the works of Ossian. If ever he composed any thing of a merry turn it is long since lost. The serious and melancholy make the most lasting impressions on the human mind, and bid fairest for being transmitted from generation to generation by tradition. Nor is it probable that Ossian dea't much in chearful composition. Melancholy is so much the companion of a great genius, that it is difficult to separate the idea of levity from chearfulness, which is some∣times the mark of an amiable disposition, but never the characteristic of elevated parts.</P></NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>BEND thy blue course, O stream, round the narrow plain of Lutha<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lutha, <HI>swift stream.</HI> It is impossible, at this distance of time, to ascertain where the scene here described lies. Tradition is silent on that head, and there is nothing in the poem from which a conjecture can be drawn.</NOTE>.

<PB N="258" REF="286"/>
of my fading is near, and the blast that shall scatter my leaves. To-morrow shall the traveller come, he that saw me in my beauty shall come; his eyes will search the field, but they will not find me?—So shall they search in vain, for the voice of Cona, after it has failed in the field. The hunter shall come forth in the morning, and the voice of my harp shall not be heard. <Q REND="inline">"Where is the son of car-borne Fingal?"</Q> The tear will be on his cheek.</P>

<P>I PASSED, O son of Fingal, by Tar-lutha's mossy walls. The smoke of the hall was ceased: silence was among the trees of the
<PB N="259" REF="287"/>
hill. The voice of the chace was over. I saw the daughters of the bow. I asked about Malvina, but they answered not. They turned their faces away: thin darkness covered their beauty. They were like stars, on a rainy hill, by night, each looking faintly through her mist.</P>
<P>PLEASANT<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ossian speaks. He calls Malvina a beam of light, and continues the metaphor throughout the paragraph.</NOTE> be thy rest, O lovely beam! soon hast thou set on our hills! The steps of thy departure were stately, like the moon on the blue, trembling wave. But thou hast left us in darkness, first of the maids of Lutha! We sit, at the rock, and there is no voice; no light but the meteor of fire! Son hast thou set, Malvina, daugh∣ter of generous Toscar!</P>
<P>BUT thou risest like the beam of the east, among the spirits of thy friends, where they sit in their stormy halls, the chambers of the thunder.—A cloud hovers over Cona: its blue curling sides are high. The winds are beneath it, with their wings; within it is the dwelling<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The description of this ideal palace of Fingal is very poetical, and agreeable to the notions of those times, concerning the state of the deceased, who were supposed to pursue, after death, the pleasures and employments of their former life.

His shield half covered with clouds, is like the darkened moon; when one half still remains in the wave, and the other looks sickly on the field.</P>
<P>HIS friends sit around the king, on mist; and hear the songs of Ullin: he strikes the half-viewless harp; and raises the feeble voice. The lesser heroes, with a thousand meteors, light the airy hall.
<PB N="260" REF="288"/>
Malvina rises, in the midst; a blush is on her cheek. She beholds the unknown faces of her fathers, and turns aside her humid eyes.</P>
<P>ART thou come so soon, said Fingal, daughter of generous Tos∣car? Sadness dwells in the halls of Lutha. My aged son<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ossian; who had a great friendship for Malvina, both on account of her love for his son Oscar, and her attention to his own poems.</NOTE> is sad. I hear the breeze of Cona, that was wont to lift thy heavy locks. It comes to the hall, but thou art not there; its voice is mournful among the arms of thy fathers. Go with thy rustling wing, O breeze! and sigh on Malvina's tomb. It rises yonder beneath the rock, at the blue stream of Lutha. The maids<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">That is, the young virgins who sung the funeral clegy over her tomb.</NOTE> are departed to their place; and thou alone, O breez<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> mournest there.</P>

The sons of little men<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ossian, by way of disrespect, calls those, who succeeded the heroes whose actions he celebrates, <HI>the sons of little men.</HI> Tradition is entirely silent concerning what passed in the north, immediately after the death of Fingal and all his heroes; but it appears from that term of ignominy just mentioned, that the actions of their successors were not to be compared to those of the renown∣ed Fingalians.</NOTE> were in the hall; and none remained of the heroes, but Ossian king of spears.</P>
<P>AND dost thou remember Ossian, car-borne Toscar<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Toscar was the son of that Conloch, who was also father to the lady, whose un∣fortunate death is related in the last epi∣sode of the second book of Fingal.</NOTE> son of Con∣loch?

<P>DRAW near, son of Alpin, to the song of the aged. The actions of other times are in my soul: my memory beams on the days that are past. On the days of the mighty Toscar, when our path was in the deep. Draw near, son of Alpin, to the last sound<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ossian seems to intimate by this ex∣pression, that this poem was the last of his composition; so that there is some founda∣tion for the traditional title of <HI>the last hymn of Ossian.</HI></NOTE> of the voice of Cona.</P>
<P>THE king of Morven commanded, and I raised my sails to the wind. Toscar chief of Lutha stood at my side, as I rose on the dark-blue wave. Our course was to sea-surrounded Berrathon<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Barrathón, <HI>a promontory in the midst of waves.</HI> The poet gives it the epithet of sea-surrounded, to prevent its being taken for a peninsula in the literal sense.</NOTE>, the isle of many storms. There dwelt, with his locks of age, the stately strength of Larthmor. Larthmor who spread the feast of shells to Comhal's mighty son, when he went to Starno's halls, in the days of Agandecca. But when the chief was old, the pride of his son arose, the pride of fair-haired Uthal, the love of a thousand maids. He bound the aged Larthmor, and dwelt in his sounding halls.</P>
<P>LONG pined the king in his cave, beside his rolling sea. Day did not come to his dwelling; nor the burning oak by night. But the wind of ocean was there, and the parting beam of the moon. The red star looked on the king, when it trembled on the western wave. Snitho came to Selma's hall: Snitho companion of Larthmor's youth. He told of the king of Berrathon: the wrath of Fingal rose. Thrice he assumed the spear, resolved to stretch his hand to
<PB N="262" REF="290"/>
Uthal. But the memory<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The meaning of the poet is, that Fin∣gal remembered his own great actions, and consequently would not fully them by engaging in a petty war against Uthal, who was so far his inferior in valour and power.</NOTE> of his actions rose before the king, and he sent his son and Toscar. Our joy was great on the rolling sea; and we often half-unsheathed our swords<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The impatience of a young warrior, going on their first expedition, is well marked by their half-drawing their swords. The modesty of Ossian, in his narration of a story which does him so much honour, is remarkable; and his humanity to Nina-thoma would grace a hero of our own po∣lished age. Though Ossian passes over his own actions in silence, or slightly men∣tions them; tradition has done ample ju∣stice to his martial fame, and perhaps has exaggerated the actions of the poet beyond the bounds of credibility.</NOTE>. For never before had we fought alone, in the battles of the spear. Night came down on the ocean; the winds departed on their wings. Cold and pale is the moon. The red stars lift their heads. Our course is slow along the coast of Berrathon; the white waves tumble on the rocks.</P>
<P>WHAT voice is that, said Toscar, which comes between the sounds of the waves? It is soft but mournsul, like the voice of de∣parted bards. But I behold the maid<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Nina-thoma the daughter of Tor∣thóma, who had been confined to a desart island by her lover Uthal.</NOTE>, she sits on the rock alone. Her head bends on her arm of snow: her dark hair is in the wind. Hear, son of Fingal, her song, it is smooth as the gliding waters of Lavath.—We came to the silent bay, and heard the maid of night.</P>
<P>How long will ye roll around me, blue-tumbling waters of ocean? My dwelling was not always in caves, nor beneath the whistling tree. The feast was spread in Torthóma's hall; my father delight∣ed in my voice. The youths beheld me in the steps of my loveli∣ness, and they blessed the dark-haired Nina-thoma. It was then thou didst come, O Uthal! like the sun of heaven. The souls of
<PB N="263" REF="291"/>
the virgins are thine, son of generous Larthmor! But why dost thou leave me alone in the midst of roaring waters. Was my soul dark with thy death? Did my white hand lift the sword? Why then hast thou left me alone, king of high Finthormo<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Finthormo, the palace of Uthal. The names in this episode are not of a Celtic original; which makes it probable that Ossian sounds his poem on a true story.</NOTE>!</P>
<P>THE tear started from my eye, when I heard the voice of the maid. I stood before her in my arms, and spoke the words of peace.—Lovely dweller of the cave, what sigh is in that breast? Shall Ossian lift his sword in thy presence, the destruction of thy foes?—Daugh∣ter of Torthóma, rise, I have heard the words of thy grief. The race of Morven are around thee, who never injured the weak. Come to our dark-bosomed ship, thou brighter than that setting moon. Our course is to the rocky Berrathon, to the ecchoing walls of Finthormo.—She came in her beauty, she came with all her lovely steps. Silent joy brightened in her face, as when the sha∣dows fly from the field of spring; the blue-stream is rolling in brightness, and the green bush bends over its course.</P>
<P>THE morning rose with its beams. We came to Rothma's bay. A boar rushed from the wood; my spear pierced his side. I rejoiced over the blood<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ossian thought that his killing the boar, on his first landing in Berrathon, was a good omen of his future success in that island. The present highlanders look, with a de∣gree of superstition, upon the success of their first action, after they have engaged in any desperate undertaking.</NOTE>, and foresaw my growing fame.—But now the sound of Uthal's train came from the high Fin-thormo; they spread over the heath to the chance of the boar. Himself comes slowly on, in the pride of his strength. He lifts two pointed spears. On his side is the hero's sword. Three youths carry his polished
<PB N="264" REF="292"/>
bows: the bounding of five dogs is before him. His heroes move on, at a distance, admiring the steps of the king. Stately was the son of Larthmor! but his soul was dark. Dark as the troubled face of the moon, when it foretels the storms.</P>
<P>WE rose on the heath before the king; he stopt in the midst of his course. His heroes gathered around, and a gray-haired bard ad∣vanced. Whence are the sons of the strangers! begun the bard of the song; the children of the unhappy come to Berrathon; to the sword of car-borne Uthal. He spreads no feast in his hall: the blood of strangers is on his streams. If from Selma's walls ye come, from the mossy walls of Fingal, chuse three youths to go to your king to tell of the fall of his people. Perhaps the hero may come and pour his blood on Uthal's sword; so shall the fame of Finthormo arise, like the growing tree of the vale.</P>
<P>NEVER will it rise, O bard, I said in the pride of my wrath. He would shrink in the presence of Fingal, whose eyes are the flames of death. The son of Comhal comes, and the kings vanish in his presence; they are rolled together, like mist, by the breath of his rage. Shall three tell to Fingal, that his people fell? Yes!—they may tell it, bard! but his people shall fall with fame.</P>
<P>I STOOD in the darkness of my strength; Toscar drew his sword at my side. The foe came on like a stream: the mingled sound of death arose. Man took man, shield met shield; steel mixed its beams with steel.—Darts hiss through air; spears ring on mails; and swords on broken bucklers bound. As the noise of an aged grove beneath the roaring wind, when a thousand ghosts break the trees by night, such was the din of arms.—But Uthal fell beneath my sword; and the sons of Berrathon fled.—It was then I saw him in
<PB N="265" REF="293"/>
his beauty, and the tear hung in my eye. Thou art fallen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To mourn over the fall of their enemies was a practice universal among Ossian's heroes. This is more agreeable to huma∣nity, than the shameful insulting of the dead, so common in Homer, and after him, servilely copied by all his imitators, the humane Virgil not excepted, who have been more successful in borrowing the im∣perfections of that great poet, than in their imitations of his beauties. Homer, it is probable, gave the manners of the times in which he wrote, not his own senti∣ments: Ossian also seems to keep to the sentiments of his heroes. The reverence, which the most barbarous highlanders have still for the remains of the deceased, seems to have descended to them from their most remote ancestors.</NOTE>, young tree, I said, with all thy beauty round thee. Thou art fallen on thy plains, and the field is bare. The winds come from the desart, and there is no sound in thy leaves! Lovely art thou in death, son of car-borne Larthmor.</P>
<P>NINA-THOMA sat on the shore, and heard the sound of battle. She turned her red eyes on Lethmal the gray-haired bard of Selma, for he had remained on the coast, with the daughter of Torthóma. Son of the times of old! she said, I hear the noise of death. Thy friends have met with Uthal and the chief is low! O that I had remained on the rock, inclosed with the tumbling waves! Then would my soul be sad, but his death would not reach my ear. Art thou fallen on thy heath, O son of high Finthormo! thou didst leave me on a rock, but my soul was full of thee. Son of high Finthormo! art thou fallen on thy heath?</P>
<P>SHE rose pale in her tears, and saw the bloody shield of Uthal; she saw it in Ossian's hand; her steps were distracted on the heath. She flew; she found him; she fell. Her soul came forth in a sigh. Her hair is spread on his face. My bursting tears descend. A tomb arose on the unhappy; and my song was heard.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="294"/>
REST, hapless children of youth! and the noise of that mossy stream. The virgins will see your tomb, at the chace, and turn away their weeping eyes. Your fame will be in the song; the voice of the harp will be heard in your praise. The daughters of Selma shall hear it; and your renown shall be in other lands.—Rest, children of youth, at the noise of the mossy stream.</P>
<P>Two days we remained on the coast. The heroes of Berrathon convened. We brought Larthmor to his halls; the feast of shells is spread.—The joy of the aged was great; he looked to the arms of his fathers; the arms which he left in his hall, when the pride of Uthal arose—We were renowned before Larthmor, and he blessed the chiefs of Morven; but he knew not that his son was low, the stately strength of Uthal. They had told, that he had retired to the woods, with the tears of grief; they had told it, but he was silent in the tomb of Rothma's heath.</P>
<P>ON the fourth day we raised our sails to the roar of the northern wind. Larthmor came to the coast, and his bards raised the song. The joy of the king was great, he looked to Rothma's gloomy heath; he saw the tomb of his son; and the memory of Uthal rose.—Who of my heroes, he said, lies there: he seems to have been of the kings of spears? Was he renowned in my halls, before the pride of Uthal rose?</P>
<P>YE are silent, ye sons of Berrathon, is the king of heroes low?—My heart melts for thee, O Uthal; though thy hand was against thy father.—O that I had remained in the cave! that my son had dwelt in Finthormo!—I might have heard the tread of his feet, when he went to the chace of the boar.—I might have heard

his voice on the blast of my cave. Then would my soul be glad: but now darkness dwells in my halls.</P>
<P>SUCH were my deeds, son of Alpin, when the arm of my youth was strong; such were<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ossian speaks.</NOTE> the actions of Toscar, the car-borne son of Conloch. But Toscar is on his flying cloud; and I am alone at Lutha: my voice is like the last sound of the wind, when it forsakes the woods. But Ossian shall not be long alone, he sees the mist that shall receive his ghost. He beholds the mist that shall sorm his robe, when he appears on his hills. The sons of little men shall behold me, and admire the stature of the chiefs of old. They shall creep to their caves, and look to the sky with fear; for my steps shall be in the clouds, and darkness shall roll on my side.</P>
<P>LEAD, son of Alpin, lead the aged to his woods. The winds begin to rise. The dark wave of the lake resounds. Bends there not a tree from Mora with its branches bare? It bends, son of Alpin, in the rustling blast. My harp hangs on a blasted branch. The sound of its strings is mournful.—Does the wind touch thee, O harp, or is it some passing ghost!—It is the hand of Malvina! but bring me the harp, son of Alpin; another song shall rise. My soul shall depart in the sound; my fathers shall hear it in their airy hall.—Their dim faces shall hang, with joy, from their clouds; and their hands receive their son.</P>
<P><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Here begins the lyric piece, with which, tradition says, Ossian concluded his poems.—It is set to music, and still sung in the north, with a great deal of wild simplicity, but little variety of sound.</NOTE> The aged oak bends over the stream. It sighs with all its moss. The withered fern whistles near, and mixes, as it waves, with Ossian's hair.—Strike the harp and raise the song: be near, with

all your wings, ye winds. Bear the mournful sound away to Fingal's airy hall. Bear it to Fingal's hall, that he may hear the voice of his son; the voice of him that praised the mighty.—The blast of north opens thy gates, O king, and I behold thee sitting on mist, dimly gleaming in all thine arms. Thy form now is not the terror of the valiant: but like a watery cloud; when we see the stars be∣hind it with their weeping eyes. Thy shield is like the aged moon: thy sword a vapour half-kindled with fire. Dim and feeble is the chief, who travelled in brightness before.—</P>
<P>BUT thy steps<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>This magnificent description of the power of Fingal over the winds and storms, and the image of his taking the sun, and hiding him in the clouds, do not correspond with the preceding paragraph, where he is represented as a feeble ghost, and no more the TERROR OF THE VA∣LIANT; but it agrees with the notion of the times concerning the souls of the de∣ceased, who, it was supposed, had the command of the winds and storms, but tock no concern in the affairs of men.</P>
<P>It was the immoderate praise bestowed by the poets on their departed friends, that gave the first hint to superstition to deify the deceased heroes; and those new divi∣nities owed all their attributes to the fancy of the bard who sung their elegies.</P>
<P>We do not find, that the praises of Fin∣gal had this effect upon his countrymen; but that is to be imputed to the idea they had of power, which they always con∣nected with bodily strength and personal valour, both which were dissolved by death.</P></NOTE> are on the winds of the desart, and the storms darken in thy hand. Thou takest the sun in thy wrath, and hidest him in thy clouds. The sons of little men are afraid; and a thou∣sand showers descend.—</P>
<P>BUT when thou comest forth in thy mildness; the gale of the morning is near thy course. The sun laughs in his blue fields; and the gray stream winds in its valley.—The bushes shake their green heads in the wind. The roes bound towards the desart.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="297"/>
BUT there is a murmur in the heath! the stormy winds abate! I hear the voice of Fingal. Long has it been absent from mine ear!—Come, Ossian, come away, he says: Fingal has received his fame. We passed away, like flames that had shone for a season, our departure was in renown. Though the plains of our battles are dark and silent; our fame is in the four gray stones. The voice of Ossian has been heard; and the harp was strung in Selma.—Come Ossian, come away, he says, and fly with thy fathers on clouds.</P>
<P>AND come I will, thou king of men! the life of Ossian fails. I begin to vanish on Cona; and my steps are not seen in Selma. Beside the stone of Mora I shall fall asleep. The winds whistling in my grey hair, shall not waken me.—Depart on thy wings, O wind: thou canst not disturb the rest of the bard. The night is long, but his eyes are heavy; depart, thou rustling blast.</P>
<P>BUT why art thou sad, son of Fingal? Why grows the cloud of thy soul? The chiefs of other times are departed; they have gone without their fame. The sons of future years shall pass away; and another race arise. The people are like the waves of ocean: like the leaves<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>The same thought may be found al∣most in the same words, in Homer, vi. 46.<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L>

<P>Mr. Pope falls short of his original; in particular he has omitted altogether the beautiful image of the wind strewing the withered leaves on the ground.<Q><L>Like leaves on trees the race of men are sound,</L>

DID thy beauty last, O Ryno<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ryno, the son of Fingal, who was kill∣ed in Ireland, in the war against Swaran, [Fing. b. 5.] was remarkable for the beau∣ty of his person, his swiftness and great exploits. Minvane, the daughter of Mor∣ni, and sister to Gaul so often mentioned in Ossian's compositions, was in love with Ryno.—Her lamentation over her lover is introduced as an episode in one of Ossian's great poems. The lamentation is the only part of the poem now extant, and as it has some poetical merit, I have subjoined it to this note. The poet represents Min∣vane as seeing, from one of the rocks of Morven, the fleet of Fingal returning from Ireland.
<Q REND="inline"><P>SHE blushing sad, from Morven's rocks, bends over the darkly-rolling sea. She saw the youths in all their arms.—Where, Ryno, where art thou?</P>
<P>Our dark looks told that he was low!—That pale the hero flew on clouds! That in the grass of Morven's hills, his feeble voice was heard in wind!</P>
<P>And is the son of Fingal fallen, on Ul∣lin's mossy plains? Strong was the arm that conquered him!—Ah me! I am alone.</P>
<P>Alone I will not be, ye winds! that lift my dark-brown hair. My sighs will not long mix with your stream; for I must sleep with Ryno.</P>
<P>I see thee not with beauty's steps return∣ing from the chace.—The night is round Minaven's love; and silence dwells with Ryno.</P>
<P>Where are thy dogs, and where thy bow? Thy shield that was so strong? Thy sword like heaven's descending fire? The bloody spear of Ryno?</P>
<P>I see them mixed in thy ship; I see them stained with blood.—No arms are in thy narrow hall, O darkly-dwelling Ryno!</P>
<P>When will the morning come, and say, arise, thou king of spears! arise, the hun∣ters are abroad. The hinds are near thee, Ryno!</P>
<P>Away, thou fair-haired morning, away! the slumbering king hears thee not! The hinds bound over his narrow tomb; for death dwells round young Ryno.</P>
<P>But I will tread softly, my king! and steal to the bed of thy repose. Minvane will lie in silence, near her slumbering Ryno.</P>
<P>The maids shall seek me; but they shall not find me: they shall follow my depar∣ture with songs. But I will not hear you, O maids: I sleep with fair-haired Ryno.</P></Q></NOTE>? Stood the strength of car-borne Oscar? Fingal himself passed away; and the halls of his fathers forgot his steps.—And shalt thou remain, aged bard! when the mighty have failed?—But my fame shall remain, and grow like the oak of Morven; which lifts its broad head to the storm, and rejoices in the course of the wind.</P>
