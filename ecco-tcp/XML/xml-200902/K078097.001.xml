<P>THE ATHENAID, written by the late Richard Glover, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> was left by him, among other literary works, to Miss Glover (now Mrs. Halsey) who presents it to the Public exactly copied from her Fa∣ther's Manuscript, except what regards the punctuation, and introduction of now and then a connective word, inserted by the good offices of a Friend.—The Poem was not finished early enough before Mr. Glo∣ver's decease for him to revise it, as he intended; yet, incorrect as it may be for want of such revisal, the Editor flatters herself that it will be favorably received, as the genuine work of an Author, who was ever distinguished by public approba∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion.—An earnest desire of doing honor to

the memory of a deceased Parent, and also of gratifying the literary world with the Sequel to LEONIDAS, which the present Poem contains, and which together includes the most brilliant period of the Grecian History, are the motives for her Publica∣tion.</P>

<HEAD>BOOK the FIRST.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THE Persians vanquish'd, Greece from bon∣dage sav'd,</L>
<L>The death of great Leonidas aveng'd</L>
<L>By Attic virtue—celebrate, O Muse!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="4">A burning ray the summer solstice cast,</L>
<L>Th' Olympiad was proclaim'd; when Xerxes pour'd</L>
<L>His millions through Thermopylae, new-stain'd</L>
<L>With blood. From Athens Aeschylus divine</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="7"/>
In genius, arts, and valour, musing deep</L>
<L>On his endanger'd country's future doom,</L>
<L N="10">Repairs, invited by an evening still,</L>
<L>To clear Ilissus, Attic stream renown'd.</L>
<L>Beneath an oak, in solitary state</L>
<L>Apart, itself a wood, the hero's limbs</L>
<L>On tufted moss repose. He grasps the lyre;</L>
<L N="15">Unfolded scrolls voluminous he spreads</L>
<L>Along the ground: high lays repeating thence,</L>
<L>Leonidas the Spartan he extols,</L>
<L>And sweeps th' accordant strings. To closing day</L>
<L>He bade farewel, and hail'd th' ascending stars</L>
<L N="20">In music long continued; till the stream</L>
<L>With drowsy murmur won his eye to sleep,</L>
<L>But left his fancy waking. In a dream</L>
<L>The god of day, with full meridian blaze,</L>
<L>Seem'd to assume his function o'er the skies;</L>
<L N="25">When, lo! the earth divided: through the cleft</L>
<L>A gush of radiance dimm'd the noon-tide sun.</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="8"/>
In structure all of diamond, self pois'd,</L>
<L>Amid redundant light a chariot hung</L>
<L>Triumphal. Twelve transparent horses breath'd</L>
<L N="30">Beams from their nostrils, dancing beams of day</L>
<L>Shook from their manes. In lineaments of man,</L>
<L>Chang'd to immortal, there the mighty soul</L>
<L>Of Sparta's king apparent shone. His wounds</L>
<L>Shot forth a splendour like the clust'ring stars,</L>
<L N="35">Which on Orion's chest and limbs proclaim</L>
<L>Him first of constellations. Round in cars</L>
<L>Of triumph too arrang'd, the stately forms</L>
<L>Of those whom virtue led to share his doom,</L>
<L>And consecrate Thermopylae to fame.</L>
<L N="40">Pines tipp'd with lightning seem'd their spears; their shields</L>
<L>Broad like Minerva's aegis: from their helms</L>
<L>An empyreal brightness stream'd abroad:</L>
<L>Ineffable felicity their eyes,</L>
<L>Their fronts the majesty of gods display'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="9"/>
<L N="45">Erect the glorious shape began to speak</L>
<L>In accents louder than a bursting cloud—</L>
<L>Pentelicus, Hymettus seem'd to shake</L>
<L>Through all their quarries, and Ilissus beat</L>
<L>His shudd'ring banks in tumult—Thou, whose muse</L>
<L N="50">Commands th' immortalizing trump of fame,</L>
<L>Go to the sage Hellanodics, the just</L>
<L>Elēan judges of Olympian palms;</L>
<L>There in thy own celestial strains rehearse,</L>
<L>Before that concourse wide, our deeds and fate.</L>
<L N="55">Let our example general Greece inspire</L>
<L>To face her danger; let the Spartan shield</L>
<L>Protect th' Athenians, else I died in vain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The brilliant vision, now dispersing, leaves</L>
<L>The wond'ring bard. He, starting, in his ken</L>
<L N="60">Discerns no other than the real scene</L>
<L>Of shadows brown from close embow'ring wood,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="10"/>
Than distant mountains, and the spangled face</L>
<L>Of heav'n, reflected from the silver stream.</L>
<L>But pensive, brooding o'er his country's fate,</L>
<L N="65">His step he turns. Themistocles, who rul'd</L>
<L>Athenian councils, instant he accosts</L>
<L>With large recital of his awful dream.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Obey the mandate, cries the chief: alarm</L>
<L>Th' Olympian concourse: from the Delphian port</L>
<L N="70">Of Cirrha sail for Elis: on thy way</L>
<L>Consult Apollo in the state's behalf,</L>
<L>Which to that function nominates thy worth:</L>
<L>Of Xerxes' march intelligence obtain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This said, they parted. Aeschylus by dawn</L>
<L>Commenc'd his progress, join'd by numbers arm'd,</L>
<L N="76">Like him to Pisa's barrier destin'd all,</L>
<L>Electing him their chief. Five times the sun</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="11"/>
Renew'd his orbit, five successive nights</L>
<L>The moon enlarg'd her crescent, ere they reach'd</L>
<L N="80">Phoebean Delphi, seated on a rock</L>
<L>Abrupt, sublime. Yet thence the curious eye</L>
<L>Must upward look to meet the summits blue</L>
<L>Of double-topp'd Parnassus, where the god</L>
<L>Oracular is worshipp'd. Here they trac'd</L>
<L N="85">Barbarian violence profane. Consum'd</L>
<L>Were hamlets, temples levell'd to the dust,</L>
<L>The statues broken, each religious bow'r</L>
<L>A burning mass of embers. Wrapt in smoke,</L>
<L>With cinders strewn, so glows the region round</L>
<L N="90">Portentous Aetna, or Vesuvius dire,</L>
<L>Death's flaming cauldrons; when their stony ribs</L>
<L>And min'ral bowels, liquefied by fire,</L>
<L>O'erwhelm the fields, by nature left unbless'd,</L>
<L>Alone unbless'd of all Sicania's bound,</L>
<L N="95">Or lovely-fac'd Hesperia. Dubious here</L>
<L>Th' Athenians halt, while fierce the sultry noon</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="12"/>
Inflames the sky. From Delphi's open gates,</L>
<L>To Attic eyes no stranger, Timon comes,</L>
<L>Sage priest of Phoebus, magistrate unsoil'd,</L>
<L N="100">The public host of Athens, to the plain</L>
<L>Descending swift with followers who bear</L>
<L>His buckler, spear, and armour. On his head</L>
<L>Were ashes sprinkled: rent, his garb presag'd</L>
<L>Some black disaster. What malignant dart</L>
<L N="105">Of fortune wounds thee? Aeschylus aloud,</L>
<L>While by the hand Cecropia's host he press'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To him the Delphian: From deserted roofs,</L>
<L>Depopulated streets, I come to hail</L>
<L>Thee, bound by hospitable ties my friend,</L>
<L N="110">Thee, dear to Phoebus, by Minerva grac'd,</L>
<L>Thy country's goddess. Me thou often saw'st</L>
<L>A parent bless'd in Amarantha's bloom,</L>
<L>Yet ripe in virtue. Her, presenting pray'r</L>
<L>With votive flow'rs before Minerva's shrine,</L>
<L N="115"><PB N="8" REF="13"/>
This very hour Barbarians have enthrall'd,</L>
<L>Borne in my sight precipitate away.</L>
<L>O wife lamented, gather'd in thy prime</L>
<L>By ruthless Pluto! in Elysian groves</L>
<L>How shall I meet thee, and the tidings bear</L>
<L N="120">Of thy lost child, to servitude a prey,</L>
<L>To violation doom'd? Yet more: the rage</L>
<L>Of these invaders, who have spoil'd our fields,</L>
<L>Defac'd our temples, driv'n to shelt'ring caves,</L>
<L>To pathless cliffs, our populace dismay'd,</L>
<L N="125">Is now ascending to insult the fane,</L>
<L>With sacrilegious violence to seize</L>
<L>Th' accumulated off'rings by the great</L>
<L>And good from age to age devoted there.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He scarce had finish'd, when the earth beneath</L>
<L N="130">Rock'd from her center in convulsive throes;</L>
<L>From pole to pole th' ethereal concave groan'd:</L>
<L>Night from her cavern with gigantic steps</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="14"/>
Bestrode the region, lifting high as heav'n</L>
<L>Her broad, infernal palm, whose umbrage hides</L>
<L N="135">The throne of light; while, glancing through the rifts</L>
<L>Of her black mande, overlaid with clouds,</L>
<L>Blue vapours trail'd their fires. The double head</L>
<L>Of tall Parnassus reeling, from the crag</L>
<L>Unloos'd two fragments; mountainous in bulk,</L>
<L N="140">They roll to Delphi with a crashing sound,</L>
<L>Like thunder nigh whose burst of ruin strikes</L>
<L>The shatter'd ear with horror. Thus the bard</L>
<L>Unmov'd, while round him ev'ry face is pale:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not on our heads these menaces are thrown</L>
<L N="145">By ireful nature, and portentous heav'n;</L>
<L>Th' unrighteous now, th' oppressor of mankind,</L>
<L>The sacrilegious, in this awful hour</L>
<L>Alone should feel dismay. My Delphian host,</L>
<L>Who knows but thund'ring Jove's prophetic son</L>
<L N="150"><PB N="10" REF="15"/>
Now vindicates his altar; in his name</L>
<L>Now calls the turbid elements to war?</L>
<L>What shrieks of terror fill thy native streets!</L>
<L>The hills with barb'rous dissonance of cries,</L>
<L>The caverns howl. Athenians, be prepar'd,</L>
<L>Best so when arm'd: then, Timon, case thy limbs;</L>
<L N="156">The season teems with prodigy. Secure</L>
<L>In conscious virtue, let us calmly watch</L>
<L>The mighty birth. By heav'n! through yonder gate</L>
<L>The foes are driven; confusion, wild despair,</L>
<L>With panic dread pursue them: friends, embrace</L>
<L N="161">Th' auspicious moment; lift your pious blades,</L>
<L>Ye chosen men, auxiliars to a god!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He spake, advancing with his holy friend</L>
<L>To battle. Shiv'ring at their own misdeed,</L>
<L N="165">At heav'n-inflicted punishment, the foes</L>
<L>Unnerv'd, distracted, unresisting, deem'd</L>
<L>The warriors two celestials from above,</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="16"/>
Cas'd in Vulcanian panoply, to wage</L>
<L>The war of gods. The whole Athenian train</L>
<L N="170">In equal fervour with Barbarian blood</L>
<L>Distain their weapons. So from forests drear,</L>
<L>When barren winter binds the foodful earth,</L>
<L>Enrag'd by famine, trooping wolves invade</L>
<L>A helpless village; unwithstood, they range</L>
<L N="175">With greedy fangs, and dye with human gore</L>
<L>The snow-envelop'd ways. The Delphian race,</L>
<L>By fear so lately to the neighb'ring hills</L>
<L>And caves restrain'd, forsake their shelt'ring holds;</L>
<L>In clusters rushing on the foes dismay'd,</L>
<L N="180">Accomplish their defeat. Th' Athenian chief</L>
<L>Triumphant, red with massacre, admits</L>
<L>A Persian youth to mercy, who his shield</L>
<L>And sword surrenders. Persian, dost thou hope</L>
<L>Thy flow'ring bloom shall ripen to enjoy</L>
<L N="185">A length of days? (severe his victor spake)</L>
<L>Then to my questions utter words sincere.</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="17"/>
Reveal thy name, thy father's. Where encamps</L>
<L>The host of Xerxes? Whither doth he point</L>
<L>His inroad next? To violate this fane</L>
<L N="190">By his appointment was thy youth compell'd?</L>
<L>Last, if thou know'st, what impious savage tore</L>
<L>The Delphian maiden from Minerva's shrine?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Persian answers with a crimson'd cheek,</L>
<L>With eyes in tears—Ah! little now avails</L>
<L N="195">Th' illustrious current of Argestes' blood</L>
<L>To me a captive, less the name I bear</L>
<L>Of Artamanes. By the king's decree</L>
<L>That we were sent, that I unwilling came,</L>
<L>Is truth sincere. Our leader slain, the heaps</L>
<L N="200">Of these disfigur'd carcases have made</L>
<L>Their last atonement to th' insulted god.</L>
<L>The king in rich Orchomenus I left;</L>
<L>Who through Boeotia meditates to march</L>
<L>Against th' Athenians. He, alas! who seiz'd</L>
<L N="205"><PB N="13" REF="18"/>
The beauteous virgin at Minerva's shrine,</L>
<L>He is my brother, eldest of the race,</L>
<L>Far hence secure; while captive here I mourn</L>
<L>His heinous outrage, and my own disgrace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Addressing Timon, here Cecropia's bard:</L>
<L N="210">Preserve this youth a hostage for thy child:</L>
<L>He seems deserving; thee I know humane.</L>
<L>Now to Apollo's temple be my guide.</L>
<L>Still dost thou droop?—O Aeschylus, exclaims</L>
<L>Desponding Timon, from the woes begun</L>
<L N="215">This day in Delphi, I to Athens trace</L>
<L>A series black with evil. Lo! the wise,</L>
<L>The righteous Aristides from your walls</L>
<L>Through jealousy of merit is expell'd;</L>
<L>Themistocles the cause. Himself, though great,</L>
<L N="220">Yet envious, and ambitious that his light</L>
<L>May blaze unrivall'd, of th' Athenian state</L>
<L>Extinguishes the brightest. Sparta shews,</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="19"/>
At this dread crisis, how the hearts of men</L>
<L>By selfish eares and falsehood are deprav'd.</L>
<L N="225">She to the land of Pelops still confines</L>
<L>Her efforts, on the neighb'ring isthmus rears</L>
<L>A partial bulwark, leaving half the Greeks,</L>
<L>Your noble seat, this oracle, expos'd</L>
<L>To devastation: little she regards</L>
<L N="230">Our god profan'd, our progeny enslav'd;</L>
<L>Her chief Pausanias, arrogant and stern,</L>
<L>O'erlooks my suff'rings. Feeling what I fear</L>
<L>For thee and others, I must droop, my friend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To him the bard, in these sententious strains:</L>
<L N="235">Not endless sunshine is the lot of man,</L>
<L>Nor ever blooming seasons. Night succeeds</L>
<L>The day, as day the night: rude winter frowns,</L>
<L>Fair summer smiles. Thus variable the mind,</L>
<L>Not less than human fortune, feels the strife</L>
<L N="240">Of truth and error, which alternate reign</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="20"/>
The arbiters of nature. Dark the deed,</L>
<L>A deed of gloomy night, when envy forc'd</L>
<L>The best Athenian from his natal roof:</L>
<L>But light will soon return. Though Sparta break</L>
<L N="245">Her promise pledg'd; though false Boeotia prop</L>
<L>A foreign throne; still Athens will sustain</L>
<L>Herself and Greece, will retribution pay</L>
<L>To Aristides, and her morn dispel</L>
<L>The mist of error with a glorious blaze.</L>
<L N="250">No more—my duty calls me to the fane.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>They move, and passing by Minerva's grove,</L>
<L>Two monuments of terror see. There stopp'd</L>
<L>The massy fragments, from Parnassus rent:</L>
<L>An act of nature, by some latent cause</L>
<L N="255">Disturb'd. Tremendous o'er Barbarian ranks</L>
<L>The ruins down the sacred way had roll'd,</L>
<L>Leaving its surface horrible to sight;</L>
<L>Such as might startle war's remorseless god,</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="21"/>
And shake his heart of adamant. Not long</L>
<L N="260">This blood-congealing spectacle detains</L>
<L>The troop, which swiftly to the Pythian dome</L>
<L>Press their ascending steps. The martial bard</L>
<L>First, as enjoin'd by holy form, to scenes</L>
<L>Far diff'rent, sweet Castalia's fount and grove,</L>
<L N="265">Resorts, with pure ablution to redeem</L>
<L>From dust and slaughter his polluted limbs,</L>
<L>To holy eyes obscene. Beside the fane,</L>
<L>Within a flow'ring bosom of the hill,</L>
<L>Through veins of rock beneath embow'ring shade,</L>
<L N="270">The rills divine replenish, as they flow,</L>
<L>A cavity of marble. O'er the brim,</L>
<L>In slender sheets of liquid crystal, down</L>
<L>They fall harmonious. Plistus takes below</L>
<L>To his smooth bed their tribute. Plunging there</L>
<L N="275">In deep obscurity of wood, whose roof</L>
<L>With ridgy verdure meets the low-bent eye</L>
<L>From that stupendous cliff, his current winds</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="22"/>
Through shade awhile; thence issuing large in view,</L>
<L>Refreshes grateful meads, by mountains edg'd,</L>
<L N="280">Which terminate on Cirrha, Delphian port.</L>
<L>Beyond her walls blue Neptune spreads his face</L>
<L>Far as Achaia's wide expanse of coast,</L>
<L>With tow'rs and cities crown'd. The marble fount</L>
<L>On either side is skirted thick by groves</L>
<L N="285">Of ancient laurel with luxuriant arms,</L>
<L>In glossy green attir'd. There Phoebus, pride</L>
<L>Of Parian quarries, stands a form divine,</L>
<L>In act to draw an arrow from the case</L>
<L>Loose hanging o'er his shoulder; and in look</L>
<L N="290">Serene, but stern: his worshippers to guard,</L>
<L>As if the Pythian serpent were in sight,</L>
<L>He meditates the combat. Here disarm'd,</L>
<L>His limbs from all th' impurities of Mars</L>
<L>Th' Athenian purges. Menial care supplies</L>
<L N="295">A garment silver-white: an olive branch</L>
<L>His suppliant hand sustains. He seeks the fane;</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="23"/>
He mounts the steps magnificent: the gates</L>
<L>On sounding hinges turn their brazen valves.</L>
<L>Across an area vast, with solemn shade</L>
<L N="300">Of massy columns border'd, slow he moves</L>
<L>His manly frame. Procumbent at the mouth</L>
<L>Of that abyss oracular, whose fume</L>
<L>Breathes wild sensation through the Pythian maid,</L>
<L>With hands outstretch'd, he offers up this pray'r:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="305">O vanquisher of Python! Seed of Jove,</L>
<L>Whose eleutherian might the tyrant dreads!</L>
<L>Bright pow'r of day, dispenser of that fire</L>
<L>Which kindles genius in the human breast!</L>
<L>God of that light diffusing through the soul</L>
<L>The rays of truth and knowledge! Friend to man,</L>
<L N="311">His monitor prophetic! O admit</L>
<L>Athenians, anxious for their country's weal,</L>
<L>In this her day of peril to consult</L>
<L>Thy wisdom, thy protection to implore!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="19" REF="24"/>
<L N="315">Her tripod high the prophetess ascends:</L>
<L>Enthusiastic motion strains her form,</L>
<L>In flashes rolls her eyeballs, and bespreads</L>
<L>Her agitated front with floating hair.</L>
<L>Her weight a laurel, planted nigh, upholds,</L>
<L N="320">Which she embraces; her convulsive grasp</L>
<L>Shakes to the root the groaning trunk, the boughs,</L>
<L>The clatt'ring foliage. Forth she bursts in foam.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fly, wretched men, to earth's extremest bound!</L>
<L>I see, I see th' Acropolis in flames,</L>
<L N="325">Your temples crumble, and your turrets nod:</L>
<L>I see the blood run sable through your streets.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>All unabash'd, the hero firm replies:</L>
<L>Yet further speak. Though citadel and fanes</L>
<L>Be doom'd to ashes, must the nation fall?</L>
<L N="330">If so, instruct thy suppliants how their fall</L>
<L>May prove most glorious in the sight of gods</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="25"/>
And men.—The Pythian answers with a look</L>
<L>Of pity, soft'ning her tempestuous rage:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah! still my tongue like adamant is hard.</L>
<L N="335">Minerva's tow'rs must perish: Jove severe</L>
<L>So wills; yet granting, at his daughter's suit,</L>
<L>Her people refuge under walls of wood.</L>
<L>But shun the myriads of terrific horse,</L>
<L>Which on your fields an eastern Mars will range.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="340">She ceas'd; Th' Athenian notes her answer down:</L>
<L>To one, the most entrusted of his train,</L>
<L>He gives the tablet. Back to Athens fly,</L>
<L>He said; the son of Neocles alone,</L>
<L>By his unbounded faculties, can pierce</L>
<L N="345">The hidden sense of these mysterious strains;</L>
<L>All which of Xerxes thou hast heard, report:</L>

<LG>
<L N="15">Hail, Aristides! On th' Olympian games</L>

<L>Can they provide to equal thy desert?</L>
<L>While others court the prize of strength and skill,</L>

<L>Shall, what we can, decree dispraise to those</L>

<L>Forbear that censure, Aristides spake:</L>

To bold defence. I gladly am forestall'd</L>

<L>Immortalize the brave. I now invoke,</L>

<L>My gallant fellow-citizens, you come</L>

Had else deserted. Irksome, I confess,</L>

<L>You have embrac'd her. Yielding to the Greeks,</L>
<L N="141">You fix their station here, the num'rous foe</L>

<L>Resigning now an empty name of pow'r,</L>

My bosom pierc'd by transport yet unknown?</L>

<L>Three days succeeding were to gymnic feats</L>
<L>Devoted; Medon's warlike spear obtains</L>
<L>A second chaplet; Haliartus won</L>
<L N="420">The wrestler's prize; to hurl the massy disk</L>
<L>None match'd the skill of Timon, still robust,</L>
<L>Tho' rev'rend threads of silver had begun</L>
<L>To streak his locks of sable. Southern gales</L>
<L>Now call on Medon's laden fleet to sail,</L>
<L N="425">Ere winter frowns. With Timon at his side,</L>
<L>And Haliartus, in this gentle phrase</L>
<L>His noble host and hostess fair he greets:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>May ev'ry joy kind wishes can devise,</L>
<L>Or language utter, hospitable pair,</L>
<L N="430"><PB N="275" REF="286"/>
Be yours for ever! may a num'rous race</L>
<L>In virtue grow by your parental care!—</L>
<L>With sev'n dear pledges of connubial love</L>
<L>I left a brother, watching my return</L>
<L>In Atalanté, small, exhausted isle,</L>
<L>Which needs my instant succour. Gen'rous friend,</L>
<L N="436">To thee I trust my treasure, thou discharge</L>
<L>The claim of Troezen for th' abundant stores</L>
<L>Which load our vessels; for a time farewell,</L>
<L>The vernal sun will see our love renew'd,</L>
<L N="440">And swords combin'd against Mardonius bold.</L>

<L>He said: the lovely Ariphilia weeps;</L>
<L>Cleander sighs, but speeds his parting guests.</L>
