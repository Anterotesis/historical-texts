<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT TO THE FORMER EDITIONS.</HEAD>
<P>THE intent of the following Volumes is to preserve to the Public those poe∣tical performances, which seemed to merit a longer remembrance than what would pro∣bably be secured to them by the MANNER wherein they were originally published. This design was first suggested to the Editor, as it was afterwards conducted, by the opinions of some Gentlemen, whose names it would do him the highest honour to mention. He desires in this place also to make his acknow∣ledgments to the Authors of several pieces <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nserted in these Volumes, which were never before in print; and which, he is persuaded, would be thought to add credit to the most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>udicious collection of this kind in our lan∣guage.
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
He hath nothing farther to premise, but that the Reader must not expect to be pleased with every particular poem which is here presented to him. It is impossible to furnish out an entertainment of this nature, where every part shall be relished by every guest: it will be sufficient, if nothing is set before him, but what has been approved by those of the most acknowledged taste.</P>

</FIGURE>ON THE PROSPECT OF PEACE, A POEM. By THOMAS TICKELL, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mr. Tickell was born in the year 1686, at Bridekirk in Cumber∣land, where his father, a clergyman, then lived. He became a member of Queen's College, Oxford, in April 1701. On the 22d of February, 1708, he took the degree of M. A. and two years afterwards was chosen Fellow of his College. During his residence at the University, the Opera of Rosamond was performed, and on its appearance, Mr. Tickell addressed a Poem to Mr. Addison, the Author, which was so well received, that it laid the foundation of an intimacy between the two friends, and proved of the greatest advantage to Mr. Tickell's fu∣ture fortune. When Mr. Addison went to Ireland as Secretary to Lord Sunderland, Mr. Tickell accompanied him, and was employed in public business. In 1717, he became Under Secretary of State, and about 1725, was appointed Secretary to the Lords Justices of Ireland, a place of great honour, in the enjoyment whereof he continued until his death, which happened at Bath, on the 23d of April 1740.</NOTE> To the LORD PRIVY-SEAL.<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">This was Dr. John Robinson, then Bishop of Bristol, but after∣wards of London. He was born near Richmond in Yorkshire, and resided some years at Oriel College, Oxford, where he took the degree of M. A. March 5, 1683, and of D. D. by diploma, 7th of August 1710. He had lived many years in Sweden, first as Chaplain to the Ambassador, and afterwards in the quality of Ambassador himself. In both these stations he conducted himself with great credit and advantage to the government. On his return home, he was preferred to a Prebend at Canterbury, then to the Deanry of Windsor, and afterwards to the Bishoprick of Bristol. In 1711, the custody of the Privy Seal was given to him, and he was nominated one of the Plenipotentiaries to negotiate the treaty of Utrecht. On the 13th March, 1713, he was translated to the See of London, and died 11th of April 1723.</NOTE></HEAD>

<L>Made tim'rous vows, and brib'd the saints in vain;</L>
<L>As oft his legions did the fight decline,</L>

<L>Before his eyes the fancy'd javelin gleams;</L>
<L>At feasts he starts, and seems dethron'd in dreams;</L>

<L>At her decree the war suspended stands,</L>

<L>At whose dire names ten thousand widows press'd</L>

<L>Brave minds, howe'er at war, are secret friends,</L>

<L>What urg'd this mighty empire to its fate,</L>
<L>A tale of woe and wonder, I relate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When Albion rul'd the land, whose lineage came</L>
<L>From Neptune mingling with a mortal dame,</L>
<L>Their midnight pranks the sprightly fairies play'd</L>
<L>On every hill, and danc'd in every shade.</L>
<L>But, foes to sun-shine, most they took delight</L>
<L>In dells and dales conceal'd from human sight:</L>
<L>There hew'd their houses in the arching rock;</L>
<L>Or scoop'd the bosom of the blasted oak;</L>
<L>Or heard, o'ershadow'd by some shelving hill,</L>
<L>The distant murmurs of the failing rill.</L>
<L><PB N="51" REF="55"/>They, rich in pilfer'd spoils, indulg'd their mirth,</L>
<L>And pity'd the huge wretched sons of earth.</L>
<L>Even now, 'tis said, the hinds o'erheard their strain,</L>
<L>And strive to view their airy forms in vain:</L>
<L>They to their cells at man's approach repair,</L>
<L>Like the shy leveret, or the mother hare,</L>
<L>The whilst poor mortals startle at the sound</L>
<L>Of unseen footsteps on the haunted ground.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Amid this garden, then with woods o'ergrown,</L>
<L>Stood the lov'd seat of royal Oberon.</L>
<L>From every region to his palace gate</L>
<L>Came peers and princes of the fairy state,</L>
<L>Who, rank'd in council round the sacred shade,</L>
<L>Their monarch's will and great behests obey'd.</L>
<L>From Thames' fair banks, by lofty tow'rs adorn'd,</L>
<L>With loads of plunder oft his chiefs return'd:</L>
<L>Hence in proud robes, and colours bright and gay,</L>
<L>Shone every knight and every lovely fay.</L>
<L>Whoe'er on Powell's <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">A famous puppet-show man, whose name frequently occurs in the Spectator.</NOTE> dazzling stage display'd,</L>
<L>Hath fam'd king Pepin and his court survey'd,</L>
<L>May guess, if old by modern things we trace,</L>
<L>The pomp and splendour of the fairy race.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>By magic fenc'd, by spells encompass'd round,</L>
<L>No mortal touch'd this interdicted ground;</L>
<L>No mortal enter'd, those alone who came</L>
<L>Stolen from the couch of some terrestrial dame:</L>
<L><PB N="52" REF="56"/>For oft of babes they robb'd the matron's bed,</L>
<L>And left some sickly changeling in their stead.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>It chanc'd a youth of Albion's royal blood</L>
<L>Was foster'd here, the wonder of the wood;</L>
<L>Milkah, for wiles above her peers renown'd,</L>
<L>Deep-skill'd in charms and many a mystic sound,</L>
<L>As through the regal dome she sought for prey,</L>
<L>Observ'd the infant Albion where he lay</L>
<L>In mantles broider'd o'er with gorgeous pride,</L>
<L>And stole him from the sleeping mother's side.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Who now but Milkah triumphs in her mind?</L>
<L>Ah wretched nymph, to future evils blind!</L>
<L>The time shall come when thou shalt dearly pay</L>
<L>The theft, hard-hearted! of that guilty day:</L>
<L>Thou in thy turn shalt like the queen repine,</L>
<L>And all her sorrows doubled shall be thine:</L>
<L>He who adorns thy house, the lovely boy</L>
<L>Who now adorns it, shall at length destroy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Two hundred moons in their pale course had seen</L>
<L>The gay-rob'd fairies glimmer on the green,</L>
<L>And Albion now had reach'd in youthful prime</L>
<L>To nineteen years, as mortals measure time.</L>
<L>Flush'd with resistless charms he fir'd to love</L>
<L>Each nymph and little Dryad of the grove;</L>
<L>For skilful Milkah spar'd not to employ</L>
<L>Her utmost art to rear the princely boy:</L>
<L>Each supple limb she swath'd, and tender bone,</L>
<L>And to the Elfin standard kept him down:</L>
<L><PB N="53" REF="57"/>She robb'd dwarf-elders of their fragrant fruit,</L>
<L>And fed him early with the daisy's root,</L>

<L>He too was smitten, and discreetly strove</L>
<L>By courtly deeds to gain the virgin's love;</L>
<L>For her he cull'd the fairest flowers that grew,</L>
<L>Ere morning suns had drain'd their fragrant dew;</L>
<L>He chas'd the hornet in his mid-day flight,</L>
<L>And brought her glow-worms in the noon of night;</L>
<L>When on ripe fruits she cast a wishing eye,</L>

<L>So far'd it with the little love-sick maid,</L>
<L>Forbid to utter what her eyes betray'd,</L>
<L>He saw her anguish and reveal'd his flame,</L>

It has always been esteemed a very ingenious defence of the principles of Quakerism, even by those who deny the doctrines which it endeavours to establish. The Author was born at Edinburgh in 1648, and received part of his education at the Scots College in Paris, where his uncle was Princi∣pal. His father became one of the earliest converts to the new Sect, and from his example, the son seems to have been induced to tread in his steps.

<L>NOW had th' archangel trumpet, rais'd sublime</L>
<L>Above the walls of heav'n, begun to sound;</L>
<L>All aether took the blast, and hell beneath</L>
<L>Shook with celestial noise; th' almighty host</L>
<L>Hot with pursuit, and reeking with the blood</L>
<L>Of guilty cherubs smear'd in sulphurous dust,</L>
<L>Pause at the known command of sounding gold.</L>
<L>At first they close the wide Tartarian gates,</L>
<L>Th' impenetrable folds on brazen hinge</L>
<L>Roll creaking horrible; the din beneath</L>
<L>O'ercomes the roar of flames, and deafens hell.</L>
<L>Then through the solid gloom with nimble wing</L>
<L>They cut their shining traces up to light;</L>
<L><PB N="171" REF="175"/>Return'd upon the edge of heavenly day,</L>
<L>Where thinnest beams play round the vast obscure,</L>
<L>And with eternal gleam drive back the night.</L>
<L>They find the troops less stubborn, less involv'd</L>
<L>In crime and ruin, barr'd the realms of peace,</L>
<L>Yet uncondemn'd to baleful seats of woe,</L>
<L>Doubtful and suppliant; all the plumes of light</L>
<L>Moult from their shuddering wings, and sickly fear</L>
<L>Shades every face with horror; conscious guilt</L>

<L>'Tis here the wide circumference of heaven</L>
<L>Opens in two vast gates, that inward turn</L>

<L>With living sculptures, that arise by turns</L>
<L>T' imboss the shining leaves, by turns they set</L>
<L>To give succeeding argument their place;</L>
<L>In holy hieroglyphics on they move,</L>
<L>The gaze of journeying angels, as they pass</L>
<L>Oft looking back, and held in deep surprize.</L>
<L>Here stood the troops distinct; the cherub guard</L>
<L>Unbarr'd the splendid gates, and in they roll</L>
<L>Harmonious; for a vocal spirit sits</L>
<L>Within each hinge, and, as they onward drive,</L>

<HEAD><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Know YOUR SELF. By JOHN ARBUTHNOT<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Dr. Arbuthnot was descended from a noble family in Scotland, and was the son of a clergyman of the Episcopal Church in that kingdom. He was born at Arbuthnot in Kincardinshire, not long after the re∣storation; and received his education at Aberdeen, where he took his Doctor's degree. He soon afterwards removed to London, and was employ∣ed sometime in teaching the mathematics. On St. Andrew's day 1704, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society; and on the 30th October following, was sworn Physician extraordinary to Queen Anne; upon the indisposition of Dr. Hannes, he was appointed fourth Physician in ordinary to the Queen; and on 27th April 1710, was admitted a Fellow of the College of Physicians. The death of Queen Anne de∣prived him of his place and residence at Court. On 30th September 1723, he was named second Censor of the College of Physicians; and on the 5th October 1727, became an Elect of the same Society. Dur∣ing the latter part of his life, he was afflicted with an asthma, of which he died on the 27th February 1734-5. Dr. Johnson observes of Ar∣buthnot, "that he was a man estimable for his learning, amiable for his life, and venerable for his piety." The same writer also adds, "that he was a man of great comprehension, skilful in his profession, versed in the sciences, acquainted with ancient literature, and able to animate his mass of knowledge by a bright and active imagination: a scholar with great brilliancy of wit; a wit, who in the crowd of life, retained and discovered a noble ardour of religious zeal."</NOTE>, M.D.</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By the Same.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>WHEN learning's triumph o'er her barb'rous foes</L>
<L>First rear'd the stage, immortal SHAKSPEARE rose;</L>
<L>Each change of many-colour'd life he drew,</L>
<L>Exhausted worlds, and then imagin'd new:</L>
<L>Existence saw him spurn her bounded reign,</L>
<L>And panting Time toil'd after him in vain:</L>
<L>His powerful strokes presiding truth impress'd,</L>
<L>And unresisted passion storm'd the breast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then JONSON came, instructed from the school,</L>
<L>To please in method, and invent by rule;</L>
<L>His studious patience, and laborious art,</L>
<L>By regular approach assail'd the heart;</L>
<L>Cold approbation gave the ling'ring bays,</L>
<L>For those who durst not censure, scarce could praise.</L>
<L>A mortal born, he met the general doom,</L>
<L>But left, like Egypt's kings, a lasting tomb.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="214" REF="218"/>
<L>The wits of Charles found easier ways to fame,</L>
<L>Nor wish'd for JONSON'S art, or SHAKSPEARE'S flames:</L>
<L>Themselves they studied, as they felt their writ;</L>
<L>Intrigue was plot, obscenity was wit.</L>
<L>Vice always found a sympathetic friend,</L>
<L>They pleas'd their age, and did not aim to mend.</L>
<L>Yet bards like these aspir'd to lasting praise,</L>
<L>And proudly hop'd to pimp in future days.</L>
<L>Their cause was gen'ral, their supports were strong,</L>
<L>Their slaves were willing, and their reign was long;</L>
<L>'Till shame regain'd the post that sense betray'd,</L>
<L>And Virtue call'd Oblivion to her aid.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then crush'd by rules, and weaken'd as refin'd,</L>
<L>For years the power of tragedy declin'd;</L>
<L>From bard to bard the frigid caution crept,</L>
<L>'Till declamation roar'd, while passion slept.</L>
<L>Yet still did Virtue deign the stage to tread,</L>
<L>Philosophy remain'd, though Nature fled.</L>
<L>But forc'd at length her ancient reign to quit,</L>
<L>She saw great Faustus lay the ghost of Wit:</L>
<L>Exulting Folly hail'd the joyful day,</L>
<L>And pantomime and song confirm'd her sway.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But who the coming changes can presage,</L>
<L>And mark the future periods of the stage?</L>
<L>Perhaps if skill could distant times explore,</L>
<L>New Behns, new Durseys, yet remain in store.</L>
<L>Perhaps, where Lear has rav'd, and Hamlet dy'd,</L>
<L>On flying cars new sorcerers may ride.</L>
<L><PB N="215" REF="219"/>Perhaps (for who can guess th' effects of chance?)</L>
<L>Here Hunt may box, or Mahomet may dance.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hard is his lot, that here by Fortune plac'd,</L>
<L>Must watch the wild vicissitudes of taste;</L>
<L>With every meteor of caprice must play,</L>
<L>And chace the new-blown bubbles of the day.</L>
<L>Ah! let not censure term our fate our choice;</L>
<L>The stage but echoes back the public voice,</L>
<L>The drama's laws the drama's patrons give,</L>
<L>For we that live to please, must please, to live.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then prompt no more the follies you decry,</L>
<L>As tyrants doom their tools of guilt to die;</L>
<L>'Tis yours this night to bid the reign commence</L>
<L>Of rescu'd nature and reviving sense;</L>
<L>To chace the charms of sound, the pomp of show,</L>
<L>For useful mirth, and salutary woe;</L>
<L>Bid scenic virtue form the rising age,</L>
<L>And truth diffuse her radiance from the stage.</L>

<HEAD>GRONGAR HILL. Near CAERMARTHEN, South Wales. By Mr. DYER<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mr. John Dyer was the second son of Robert Dyer of Aberglasney, in Caermarthenshire, a solicitor of great capacity and note. He was born in the year 1700, and received his education at Westminster-school, from whence he returned home, being designed for his father's profession. Disliking the study of the law, he relinquished it on the death of his parent, and having an inclination for painting, became a pupil to Mr. Richardson. He then travelled into Italy, continued some time at Rome, and came back to England in 1740. His proficiency at an artist seems to have been but inconsiderable; and this circumstance, joined to an ill state of health, and the love of study, determined him to the church. He therefore entered into holy orders, and in 1741 ob∣tained the living of Calthorp, in Leicestershire, on which he lived ten years, and then exchanged it for Belchford, in Lincolnshire. In 1752 he was presented to the rectory of Coningsby, and soon after had that of Kirkby given him in addition. On the two latter he remained during the rest of his life, which ended in July 1758, of a consumptive disorder, which he had struggled with many years.</NOTE>.</HEAD>

Wright, in his Travels, p. 350, speaking of this building, observes, <Q>The lowest story is pretty much buried. Ficaroni says, he saw an architect of Verona uncover some of the buried part, and found there was an ascent of three steps to it. All the arches within were covered with ornaments of stucco, of which there are some still remaining. This noble fabric had seats sufficient to contain eighty-five thousand spectators. The seats are all gone, but the slope still remains on which they were placed, al∣most round the arena. It is built of Tiburtine stone, which has not a fine grain, but is very durable. The outside of about one half is all standing yet, quite up to the top. The body of the amphitheatre, be∣hind the seats, consisted of double galleries, that is, galleries di∣vided with pillars all along the middle of them; each gallery going quite round and inclosing the seats, as they did the arena. There were four stories of these galleries; three of them were properly porticoes of the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian orders. The uppermost is adorned with pilasters of the Corinthian or Composite order, and is lighted by windows in the wall between the pilasters, and not laid open as the other three are. Some parts of all the galleries are yet intire, for a considerable extent together, with the several communi∣cations between them, and the seats by the vomitoria (as they called the mouths of the passages, through which the crowds of people were poured into the amphitheatre to see the shews;) and such parts as still remain, give us a sufficient idea of what the whole was when the circle was compleat. Several of the fornices too, below, under the seats, where the slaves and wild beasts were kept, that were let out for combat into the arena, remain pretty entire to this day.</Q></NOTE> behold,</L>

<HEAD>THE SCHOOL-MISTRESS. A POEM, In IMITATION of SPENSER. By WILLIAM SHENSTONE, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">William Shenstone, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> was born at the Leasowes, in the parish of Hales Owen, and county of Salop, Nov. 1714. He was taught to read by the old dame whom he has delivered to posterity in the present poem, after which, he went some time to the grammar-school in Hales Owen, then to Mr. Crompton, an eminent schoolmaster at Solihul, and in 1732 was entered a commoner of Pembroke College, Oxford. He continued his name at the University ten years, but took no degree, nor made the slightest effort to engage in any profession. After spending a few years with great inattention to his fortune, and much to the in∣jury of it, he, about the year 1745, went to reside upon his estate, which he ornamented with so much taste, that it became one of the chief objects of curiosity, to those whom business or pleasure called to that part of the kingdom. Unfortunately for Mr. Shenstone, his income was not equal to the expence which his improvements demanded. He embarrassed his circumstances, and dragged out the latter part of his life discontentedly, and in distress. It is said, that if he had lived a little longer, he would have been assisted by a pension, which death prevented him from enjoying. He died at the Leasowes, of a putrid fever, about five on Friday morning, Feb. 11, 1763, and was buried in the church∣yard of Hales Owen.</NOTE></HEAD>

<L>AH me! full sorely is my heart forlorn,</L>

<L>In every village, mark'd with little spire,</L>
<L>Embow'r'd in trees, and hardly known to Fame,</L>

<L>A matron old, whom we school-mistress name;</L>

<L>They grieven sore, in piteous durance pent,</L>

<L>For not a wind might curl the leaves that blew,</L>
<L>But their limbs shudder'd, and their pulse beat low;</L>

<HEAD>THE MAN of TASTE. Occasioned by an EPISTLE Of Mr. POPE'S on that Subject. By the Same.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHoe'er he be that to a Taste aspires,</L>
<L>Let him read this, and be what he desires.</L>
<L>In men and manners vers'd, from life I write,</L>
<L>Not what was once, but what is now polite.</L>
<L>Those who of courtly France have made the tour,</L>
<L>Can scarce our English aukwardness endure.</L>
<L>But honest men who never were abroad,</L>
<L>Like England only, and its Taste applaud.</L>
<L>Strife still subsists, which yields the better goût;</L>
<L>Books or the world, the many or the few.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>True Taste to me is by this touchstone known,</L>
<L>That's always best that's nearest to my own.</L>
<L>To shew that my pretensions are not vain,</L>
<L>My father was a play'r in Drury-lane.</L>
<L><PB N="313" REF="317"/>Pears and pistachio-nuts my mother sold,</L>
<L>He a dramatic poet, she a scold.</L>
<L>His tragic Muse could countesses affright,</L>
<L>His wit in boxes was my lord's delight.</L>
<L>No mercenary priest e'er join'd their hands,</L>
<L>Uncramp'd by wedlock's unpoetic bands.</L>
<L>Laws my Pindaric parents matter'd not,</L>
<L>So I was tragi-comically got.</L>
<L>My infant tears a sort of measure kept,</L>
<L>I squall'd in distichs, and in triplets wept.</L>
<L>No youth did I in education waste,</L>
<L>Happy in an hereditary Taste.</L>
<L>Writing ne'er cramp'd the sinews of my thumb,</L>
<L>Nor barbarous birch e'er brush'd my tender bum.</L>
<L>My guts ne'er suffer'd from a college cook,</L>
<L>My name ne'er enter'd in a buttery-book.</L>
<L>Grammar in vain the sons of Priscian teach,</L>
<L>Good parts are better than eight parts of speech:</L>
<L>Since these declin'd, those undeclin'd they call,</L>
<L>I thank my stars, that I declin'd them all.</L>
<L>To Greek or Latin tongues without pretence,</L>
<L>I trust to mother wit and father sense.</L>
<L>Nature's my guide, all sciences I scorn,</L>
<L>Pains I abhor, I was a poet born.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet is my goût for criticism such,</L>

<L>Uncouth in numbers, and in sense obscure.</L>
<L>To him as nature, when he ceas'd to see,</L>
<L>Milton's an universal blank to me.</L>
<L>Confirm'd and settled by the nation's voice,</L>
<L>Rhyme is the poet's pride, and people's choice.</L>
<L>Always upheld by national support,</L>
<L>Of market, university, and court:</L>

This useful citizen, after a run of ill luck, came one morning early into the philosopher's bed-chamber with two loaded pistols; and, as Englishmen do not understand raillery in a case of this nature, told the Piedmontese, on presenting him with one of his pistols, that now was come the time to put his doctrine in practise: that as to himself, having lost his last stake, he was become an useless member in society, and so was resolved to quit his station; and that as to him, his guide, philosopher, and friend, surrounded with miseries, the out-cast of government, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sport even of that chance which he adored, he doubtless would rejoice for such an opportunity to bear him company.

<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON CONVERSATION. By BENJAMIN STILLINGFLEET<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Benjamin Stillingfleet, was the only son of Edward Stillingfleet, a clergyman in the county of Norfolk, and grandson to Dr. Stillingfleet, Bishop of Worcester. He was educated at Norwich school, which he left in 1720, and went to Trinity College Cambridge, where Dr. Bentley, who had been private tutor to his father, was then Master. He became a candidate while there for a fellowship, but through the influence of Dr. Bentley, was rejected. On this disappointment, he quitted the University, and travelled with Mr. Wyndham of Felbrig, in Norfolk, to whom this Poem is addressed, and with whom he lived in the most intimate and unreserved friendship. By the favour of the late Lord Barrington, he was appointed master of the barracks at Kensington, a place which enabled him to pursue his studies, and par∣ticularly his favourite one of Natural History, with success. He was the author of several valuable works which have been published, and of others which have not hitherto appeared. He died a batchelor, in the year 1771, at the age of upwards of seventy years, and was buried in Saint James's church.</NOTE>.</HEAD>

<L>True. But let's wait upon this fair machine</L>

<L>What means she, at one instant to disgrace</L>
<L>The labour of ten hours, her much-lov'd face?</L>
<L><PB N="332" REF="336"/>Why, 'tis the self-same passion gratify'd;</L>
<L>The work is ruin'd, that was rais'd by pride.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet of all tempers, it requires least pain,</L>
<L>Could we but rule ourselves, to rule the vain.</L>
<L>The prudent is by reason only sway'd,</L>

<L>The prodigal, unless you rob yourself;</L>
<L>The lewd will shun you, if your wife prove chaste;</L>
<L>The jealous, if a smile on his be cast;</L>
<L>The steady or the whimsical will blame,</L>
<L>Either, because you're not, or are the same;</L>
<L>The peevish, sullen, shrewd, luxurious, rash,</L>
<L>Will with your virtue, peace, or interest, clash;</L>
<L>But mark the proud man's price, how very low!</L>
<L>'Tis but a civil speech, a smile, or bow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye who, push'd on by noble ardour, aim,</L>
<L>In social life to gain immortal fame,</L>
<L>Observe the various passions of mankind,</L>
<L>General, peculiar, single, or combin'd:</L>
<L>How youth from manhood differs in its views,</L>
<L>And how old age still other paths pursues;</L>
<L>How zeal in Priscus nothing more than heats,</L>
<L>In Codex burns, and ruins all it meets;</L>
<L>How freedom now a lovely face shall wear,</L>
<L>Now shock us in the likeness of a bear;</L>
<L><PB N="333" REF="337"/>How jealousy in some resembles hate,</L>
<L>In others, seems but love grown delicate;</L>
<L>How modesty is often pride refin'd,</L>
<L>And virtue but the canker of the mind;</L>
<L>How love of riches, grandeur, life, and fame,</L>
<L>Wear different shapes, and yet are still the same.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But not our passions only disagree,</L>
<L>In taste is found as great variety:</L>
<L>Sylvius is ravish'd when he hears a hound,</L>
<L>His lady hates to death the odious sound:</L>
<L>Yet both love music, though in different ways;</L>
<L>He in a kennel, she at operas.</L>
<L>A florist shall, perhaps, not grudge some hours,</L>
<L>To view the colours in a bed of flowers;</L>
<L>Yet, shew him TITIAN'S workmanship divine,</L>
<L>He passes on, and only cries, 'tis fine.</L>
<L>A rusty coin, an old worm-eaten post,</L>
<L>The mouldy fragment of an author lost,</L>
<L>A butterfly, an equipage, a star,</L>
<L>A globe, a fine lac'd hat, a china jar,</L>
<L>A mistress, or a fashion, that is new,</L>
<L>Have each their charms, though felt but by a few.</L>
<L>Then study each man's passion and his taste,</L>
<L>The first to soften, and indulge the last:</L>
<L>Not like the wretch, who beats down virtue's fence,</L>
<L>And deviates from the paths of common sense;</L>
<L>Who daubs with fulsome flattery, blind and bold,</L>
<L>The very weakness we with grief behold.</L>
<L><PB N="334" REF="338"/>Passions are common to the fool and wise,</L>
<L>And all would hide them under art's disguise;</L>
<L>For so avow'd, in others, is their shame,</L>
<L>None hates them more, than he who has the same.</L>
<L>But taste seems more peculiarly our own,</L>
<L>And every man is fond to make his known;</L>
<L>Proud of a mark he fancies is design'd</L>
<L>By nature to advance him o'er his kind;</L>
<L>And where he sees that character impress'd,</L>
<L>With joy he hugs the favourite to his breast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But the main stress of all our cares must lie,</L>
<L>To watch ourselves with strict and constant eye:</L>
<L>To mark the working mind, when passion's course</L>
<L>Begins to swell, and reason still has force;</L>
<L>Or, if she's conquer'd by the stronger tide,</L>
<L>Observe the moments when they first subside;</L>
<L>For he who hopes a victory to win</L>
<L>O'er other men, must with himself begin;</L>
<L>Else like a town by mutiny oppress'd,</L>
<L>He's ruin'd by the foe within his breast;</L>
<L>And they alone, who in themselves oft view</L>
<L>Man's image, know what method to pursue.</L>
<L>All other creatures keep in beaten ways,</L>
<L>Man only moves in an eternal maze:</L>
<L>He lives and dies, not tam'd by cultivation,</L>
<L>The wretch of reason, and the dupe of passion;</L>
<L>Curious of knowing, yet too proud to learn;</L>
<L>More prone to doubt, than anxious to discern:</L>
<L><PB N="335" REF="339"/>Tir'd with old doctrines, prejudic'd at new;</L>

<HEAD>ODE, to a LADY. On the Death of Col. CHARLES ROSS, in the Action at Fontenoy. Written May 1745. By Mr. W. COLLINS<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">William Collins was born at Chichester on the 25th day of Decem∣ber, about 1720. His father was a hatter. In 1733 he was admitted a scholar of Winchester college, and in 1740 stood first in the list of the scholars in succession at New College; but there being no vacancy at that time, he became a commoner of Queen's College, and in about half a year after was elected a Demy of Magdalen College, where he continued until he had taken a Batchelor's degree, and then suddenly left the uni∣versity. This event happened about the year 1744. He immediately came to London, and commenced a literary adventurer; in which capa∣city he was not diligent enough to keep himself from want. In a short time he was relieved from his distresses by the death of his uncle, Mr. Martin, a lieutenant colonel, who left him about £. 2,000. From this period his health began to decline, and he gradually fell into that state of depression of mind which enchains the faculties without destroying them, and leaves reason the knowledge of right without the power of pursuing it. These clouds which he perceived gathering on his intel∣lects, he endeavoured to disperse by travel, and passed into France; but found himself constrained to yield to his malady, and returned. He was for some time confined in a house of lunatics, and afterwards retired to the care of his sister at Chichester, where death, in 1756, came to his re∣lief.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
