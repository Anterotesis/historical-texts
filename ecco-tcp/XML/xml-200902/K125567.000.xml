<PB REF="2"/>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM much obliged to you for your favour of the 5th instant. I pay such de∣ference to your opinion, that I entirely lay aside all thoughts of troubling your honourable House with the affair of repealing the act of exemp∣tion of Mail Coaches from the payment of tolls. I would avoid every adventure which does not promise success, and should be much mortified to be unhorsed and laid sprawling on the <HI>arena</HI> of St. <HI>Stephen's.</HI></P>
<P>Yet I shall be extremely sorry that any mem∣ber of your House should, through any quick∣ness of misapprehension, wilful or natural, ima∣gine me to be so wild as to think of an attempt that was not founded on reasonable and honest principles.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="3"/>I am sensible that the exemption of the Mails from the payment of tolls commenced very early: I think, first by an act of <HI>William</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> which was afterwards repeated in several others, till it was oppressively confirmed by that of the 25th Geo. III.</P>
<P>The most second-sighted of your House could never have foreseen that the usage of the single horse and post-boy, afterwards in many parts converted into the light mail-cart drawn by one horse, would be superseded by a <HI>royal</HI> car∣riage drawn by four horses, and filled by pas∣sengers, who before rode in the common stages, and contributed to support the roads which they passed over. This unfortunate change proceeded from an extent of prerogative, repined at only, when perverted to the injury of the subject; as this most incontestably must be allowed to have done.</P>
<P>Under the sanction of the first act, turnpike gates were erected, and immense sums of money lent on the national faith. For a long time the security was esteemed good; and in <HI>Wales,</HI> where
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>five per cent. was given, people at first were happy to place their money on mortgages they imagined so safe. The transfer was then easy, and the public rested perfectly content. The commissioners did their duty fully: they laid out the money to the best advantage; nor did they desist till the lowering of the tolls, by the fatal change of the mode of conveyance, had taken place.</P>
<P>I will exemplify the hardships only in the country I live. Other places equally remote from the capital must come in for their share of the grievance: but they will fall under the com∣mon description.</P>
<P>Before the institution of mail-coaches, two stage-coaches ran through the county of <HI>Flint.</HI> And, were it not for an evasion, the change of horses between gate and gate in the <HI>Mostyn</HI> district, one of the districts principally aggrieved, each would have paid forty pounds a year. This unhappily was left unguarded in the act. By the help of that evasion both together only paid that sum: and even that sum, had we not been
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>deprived of it, would have enabled us to take up 800l. more; and given us the power of re∣pairing every part of the road which was not unexceptionably good.</P>
<P>Many parts may have been allowed to have been indifferent; but they were adequate to the uses of the country, not only for the use of the farmers and the carriers, but also for the luxury of carriages.</P>
<P>In this state they were found at the introduc∣tion of mail-coaches. These soon occasioned the suppression of the common stages, and deprived us at once of forty pounds of annual income. In the year 1789, a person was sent from the General Post Office to survey the roads. From his report, and by the orders of the Post-Office, indictments were preferred at the great sessions at <HI>Mold,</HI> against the whole extent of road in the narrow but long county of <HI>Flint.</HI> In some in∣stances, I fear the grand jury made a strain of their consciences in finding the bills; for some
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>of the indicted places were in most admirable re∣pair. But we were unwilling to obstruct any thing that tended to promote the public good.</P>
<P>Fines to the amount of 1200l. were imposed on the several townships, many of which were very small, and the inhabitants composed of small farmers, and labourers, poor and distressed to the highest degree.</P>
<P>Two of these townships had a great extent of road, and only a few labourers, and a few miser∣able teams, to perform their statute duty. One of these townships, terrified with the prospect of ruin, by the execution of the <HI>summum jus,</HI> per∣formed twenty-two days duty upon the road. The other township had only a single farmer living in it, who performed a duty of twenty-eight days.</P>
<P>The vast expences which the commissioners had been at in the repairs of the roads, had almost exhausted the credit, in some totally; so that at present 50l. cannot be obtained for 400l. worth of our parchment securities.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="7"/>At this period I was moved with compassion at the complaint and distresses of the poor. This induced me to write my Circular Letter to the several grand juries of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales,</HI> in order to induce them to unite in a common cause. I blush at my want of success, resulting from either ignorance of, or indifference to, the first principles of security of property. I was simple enough to think that the justice of the cause would have insured an approbation of my plan. Instead of that, I am told, that in some places it was even treated with rudeness and contempt. I ventured even to write to two gentlemen with whom I was not personally ac∣quainted: they never paid the lest attention to my letter: they forgot my character, and they forgot their own.</P>
<P>I took the liberty of getting my Circular Letter conveyed to a third gentleman high in office, with whom I was acquainted. It was returned with (writ∣ten on a corner of it) "Mr. <HI>Pennant</HI> is in the wrong, and I will have no concern in the affair."
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>The gentleman may be politically right; but I am confident that Mr. <HI>Pennant</HI> is not morally wrong.</P>
<P>There has certainly been a strong misappre∣hension of my meaning. I did not intend the abolition of mail-coaches: they have their ob∣jections; whether we consider the barbarity with which the poor horses are treated, or the very frequent destruction of the passengers—our old <HI>Jehus</HI> may have slain their thousands; our mo∣dern, their tens of thousands. I only wished that they might not prove oppressive to many of our counties, by causes I have before mentioned. True it is, that, in my first Circular Letter, I did most rashly and unadvisedly hint, that they might, without injury, be converted into the mail-cart. The gentlemen of <HI>Somersetshire,</HI> who, I must confess, did admit that something should be done for us, very justly fired on the idea of sending their <HI>Thespis</HI> again into his cart. A worthy friend of mine of that county warmly but kindly expostulated with me on the subject: but I hope this my declaration of repentance will be admitted, and atone for my error.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="9"/>The grand juries of <HI>Cheshire, Berkshire, Mon∣mouthshire,</HI> and those of <HI>North Wales,</HI> united in the support of my design. The rest of the counties proved to me the truth of the remark of Swift, <Q>That he never knew any person who did not bear the misfortunes of another per∣fectly like a Christian!</Q></P>
<P>Far the majority of the roads in <HI>England</HI> have great revenues, arising from the multitude of stage-coaches that keep their ground in defiance of mails. Our stages are obliged to desist from travelling and give the former a most unjust, and oppressive monopoly. The counties interested in them feel not our unhappiness, and want ge∣nerosity to contribute to the alleviation of the distresses we suffer.</P>
<P>We should have made a claim on the justice of the House, had we had the most distant pro∣spect of success. We are now in the case of creditors defrauded by the superior cunning of an artful debtor. Had an individual re∣ceived an adequate mortgage on his estate, and
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>had afterwards the dexterity to lessen the income, what name would he have deserved? The highest term of reproach; but such a one that could never be applied the most remotely to any mem∣ber of your honourable House.</P>
<P>This affair has never yet been seriously con∣sidered. Good men, I trust, will now awake as from a sleep; and stand amazed and confused at the sad delusion they discovered that they had laboured under. Favourite systems run away with mankind, and totally annihilate all attention to the inconveniences they occasion. The act was obtained late in the sessions, hurried through a very thin house, and with the slightest opposi∣tion. The legislature obliges a certain time of notice to be given before the introduction of a common turnpike bill. Let me ask, should not at lest the interval of a session have been given for the discussion of so strange and unequal a taxa∣tion?</P>
<P>What, may I ask, could make the individual liable to censure; and the actions of the collec∣tive body be passed over without blame? Either the numbers defend, or some daemon, like the
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>ghostly father of <HI>Charles</HI> I. has whispered in your ears, Have a double conscience! one that is to make you consult the plain dictates of honesty: the other telling you to support some fancied public good, at the expence of a certain number of persons, who, in times not very remote, had trusted their money to the security of the public faith.</P>
<P>Or may you not hold the same doctrine as the nuns in <HI>Tristram Shandy;</HI> that the divisibility of sin may enable you to fritter it away into almost nothing?—You certainly have the advan∣tage. The nuns were but two, you are five hundred and fifty-two to bear the feather-weight of the wrong decision, you had most unwarily been induced to make.</P>
<P>Let me now ask, are there no instances of re∣peal of acts on far less important occasions? I well recollect two. The first is the <HI>Jew Act,</HI> which had in fact no consequences to be feared, religious or political. The other was the cyder tax, esteemed like ours a partial grievance; and
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>yet its overthrow was easily effected. I reflect on these two acts repealed without cause, and on our oppressions continued in defiance of every principle of justice.</P>
<P>Since your honourable House was determined to weaken our securities, ought it not to have first paid off every turnpike mortgage? and then you might have had full liberty of doing what you pleased with the income of the gates.</P>
<P>I beg leave to lay before you a case in which your House once shewed a most scrupulous atten∣tion to the rights of creditors. That was by the repeal of a clause in the <HI>Kingsland</HI> turnpike act. Part of it leads from <HI>Shoreditch</HI> to <HI>Ware,</HI> and this part was crossed by the <HI>Newmarket</HI> Road, and tolls were taken by the commissioners of the <HI>Ware</HI> Road, from all travellers to and from that seminary of virtue, merely for crossing the road. On the renewing of the <HI>Kingsland</HI> turnpike act, the <HI>Newmarket</HI> people insisted that they should pass free of tolls. A clause was inserted in the new act for that purpose, and the cross-gates
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>were pulled down. The creditors of the <HI>Kings∣land</HI> turnpike petitioned to the House of Com∣mons for redress; they succeeded, and the cross∣gates were again erected, and the tolls taken till the whole of the creditors were paid.</P>

<P>SHOREDITCH TO WARE.</P>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>I imagine that there is not a member of the House who has not acted as a commissioner of the turnpikes. Let me request him to call to mind, whether he has not in that character, or in the character of a magistrate, treated with a harsh severity the delinquent who through poverty has defrauded the gate of nine-pence. What
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>plea of conscience has the commissioner urged for maintaining the interests of the gates, and discharging his trust like a man of honour? Is there not a <HI>Lethean</HI> atmosphere in the chapel of St. <HI>Stephen,</HI> so suddenly to efface all memory of transactions in the common air of the world? I trust that there is: otherwise the individual who in one place and in one character had been so strenuous to save a poor nine-pence, should in another place and in another character vote as a perquisite to the Comptroller General of the Post-Office, an exemption of the mails from toll, a sum amounting to not less than 90,000l. a year, on which he has a most considerable poundage, besides some very good pickings from other ar∣ticles. This I am assured of by a worthy member of your House. I think his salary is but 1500l. per ann. What a monstrous quan∣tity of sack is allowed to his halfpennyworth of bread!</P>
<P>So liberally supplied as the Comptroller has
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>been with the means, cannot something be de∣ducted to relieve our complaint? If the honour∣able House does not choose this mode, a small, a very small tax on the passengers, and on the im∣mense sums got by the carriage of parcels, would compensate for the loss of exemption of tolls. The rich <HI>English</HI> districts would be above taking ad∣vantage of this diminution of revenue to the Comptroller General. It is only for the poor <HI>Welch</HI> districts, and a few others like circum∣stanced, for which it is humbly asked.</P>
<P>I have a respect for the plan of the mail∣coaches, and for the inventor; but I never could think of applying to him as the <HI>nizam al muluc,</HI> the regulator of the posting-empire. There ought not to be in our constitution such a monster as a comptroller uncontrollable by his legislature, or his superiors in office: legislature must now see its imprudence in permitting a la∣titude of so dangerous a nature. I, an indivi∣dual, never could bear the thought: I looked
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>for redress to the Post-master General, or to the three estates of the kingdom.</P>
<P>I fear too great a veneration has been paid to this new-created office, and mode of conveying the mail. I always wish to pay every individual and every office a due respect; but in this case I must preserve the independent and useful man, and endeavour to correct every abuse that falls within my sphere as a provincial magistrate. What I am going to say may be deemed foreign to a legislative friend; yet as it may prove use∣ful to many who behold these new vehicles with a kind of veneration, I shall mention an affair which happened in our county in the last au∣tumn. Let me premise, that those protectors of the mail, the guards, relying on the name of royalty, had in the course of the <HI>Irish</HI> road through <HI>North Wales,</HI> committed great excesses. One, on a trifling quarrel, shot dead a poor old gate-keeper: a coroner's jury was huddled up; and, in defiance of the tears of the widow, no judicial notice has been taken of the affair to
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>this very day. In <HI>Anglesey,</HI> another of these guards discharged his pistol wantonly in the face of a chaise horse, drawing his master, the Rev. <HI>John Bulkely,</HI> who was flung out, and died either on the spot or soon after. I think that his wife, who was with him, survived but a very short time. These guards shoot at dogs, hogs, sheep and poultry, as they pass the road, and even in towns, to the great terror and danger of the inhabitants. I determined to put a stop to these excesses, and soon had an opportunity.</P>
<P>A neighbouring gate-keeper laid before me a complaint, that one of the guards had threat∣ened to blow his brains out; and had actually shot a dog that had offended him by his bark∣ing. I issued out my warrant, had the guard seized, and brought before me. He was a man who, for his great beauty and elegant person, was called the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Wales.</HI> I did not hesitate to play the Judge <HI>Gascoigne;</HI> but from the goodness of his appearace, and the propriety of his beha∣vour, I did not go quite the length that famous magistrate did. I took bail for his appearance
<PB N="17" REF="18"/>at our quarter sessions. He appeared before us, when, by the permission of the chairman, I took the lead in speaking. I represented to the audi∣ence, that the guards were intrusted with arms merely for the protection of the mail and the passengers, not for the terror of his Majesty's subjects; that a mail-coach was no sanctuary; that the bailiff might drag the debtor out of it. The constable, the felon, the exciseman might rummage it for contraband goods, and that with as little ceremony as if it had been a hig∣gler's cart. I farther added, had the driver been the offender, as the guard was, he should have been taken into custody, and the post-master of the district left to provide another to convey the mail to the next stage. The behaviour of the delinquent was so becoming his situation, that by the leave of the court I dismissed the offend∣er with such a reprimand as became the high station of a <HI>British</HI> justice of the peace: an of∣fice in dignity and constitutional utility inferior to none in the land. Young men of the age, early initiate yourselves into that great character!</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="19"/>I beg pardon for detaining you so long, but so much I thought was due to myself and to the public. A few papers I have subjoined will fling some farther light on the subject, as well as on my proceedings from the beginning. I re∣main, with much regard,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Downing,</HI> <DATE><HI>Oct.</HI> 18, 1791.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM much indebted to you for your late fa∣vour, with an official letter inclosed. I have no kind of doubt but that the Comptroller Ge∣neral will, on cool re-consideration of his design of altering the course of the <HI>Irish</HI> mail, be in∣duced to lay it totally aside. He will admit the importance of the county of <HI>Chester</HI> in its an∣cient staple of the cheese, on which our fleets and armies so greatly depend. The city itself (if I may judge by the frequent advertisements) is about to enter deeply on the fustian manufac∣ture. We have the comfort of seeing <HI>Manches∣ter</HI> burning itself to ashes: so that we shall have all the manufacture to ourselves. The great re∣mittances
<PB N="20" REF="21"/>of taxes from the county, and from great part of <HI>North Wales,</HI> and the remittances to and from <HI>Ireland,</HI> and those occasioned by the great biennial linen fairs, must be flung into the scale.</P>
<P>The port of <HI>Park-Gate</HI> has of late years risen into much consequence. It at present maintains four stout pacquets, which uninterruptedly ply between that port and <HI>Dublin.</HI> The correspon∣dencies of the numbers of passengers embarking or disembarking, and the great remittances through this channel, are of no small moment, and of great general concern.</P>
<P>The county of <HI>Flint</HI> (little as it is of itself), thanks to you and other companies, settling among us, is now rising into an amazing state of opulence: few perhaps can rival it. Our ancient lead trade was always considerable; but by the introduction of the copper and cotton business, <HI>Holywell,</HI> its environs, and their depen∣dancies,
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>may boast of commercial property, pro∣bably to the amount of a million sterling.</P>
<P>I have always considered Mr. <HI>Palmer</HI>'s plan as useful to his country, and an honour to him∣self, except in one article. I can never suppose that he will persist in deviating from the utility of his scheme, by diverting the mail from such a country as I have described. <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> has already its mail; after <HI>Oswestry</HI> is past, the greatest part of the road to <HI>Conwy</HI> is mountain∣ous, poor, and half depopulated.</P>
<P>It gives me concern to find our interests clash with those of the county of <HI>Salop.</HI> I must allow the excellency of the great staples of its capital, brawn and rich cakes; but still we have the balance in our favour; for on the most exact and impartial calculation, I do not find that at present the annual consumption (of both together) can possibly exceed the sum of 152341l. 163. 9¾d.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="23"/>The exceptionable article I allude to is the exemption of the mail-coaches from tolls. This falls heavy on the lesser districts: possibly we might have endured even that, had we not been insulted with indictments, and compelled to re∣pairs beyond the real wants of the country. That is now over; we only wish the restoration of our lost tolls, to enable us to support the roads in the present state, and to take away all future grounds of complaint from every quarter. This will induce me to persist in my design of apply∣ing to Parliament for redress of the grievance that affects the gates from <HI>Chester</HI> to <HI>Conwy,</HI> let the rich <HI>English</HI> districts take what share they please in their own concerns. There is one diffi∣culty in <HI>Flintshire</HI> in respect to the road itself— I mean <HI>Rhiallt Hill;</HI> the alteration is beyond the power of the poor parish it lies in, and beyond the power of the poor <HI>Mostyn</HI> district to effect. Possibly the improvement may cost from 300l. to 400l. I wish a small sum might begot from Parliament, for that and the relief of a few other poor townships. I cannot bear to drive over
<PB N="23" REF="24"/>roads smoothed by the bread of the poor pea∣santry. If the mail will be permanent, I will cheerfully subscribe fifty guineas towards that improvement <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The subscription is now begun: by advice of my friends I subscribed only 25l. for fear of discouraging others from joining in this salutary design. Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> meditates an embankment across part of the <HI>Conwy,</HI> to secure passengers from the terrors of the quicksands at low water; and to lessen the length of the ferry passage at high.</NOTE>. I shall conclude with saying that a small addition to the fare of passen∣gers between <HI>Chester</HI> and <HI>Conwy,</HI> will indemnify the coach from the loss by toll. Let Mr. <HI>Pal∣mer,</HI> who cannot but be fertile in expedients, consider of the matter. My earnest wish is to have harmony restored, and the strongest mu∣tual efforts made for the general good.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Downing,</HI> <DATE><HI>January</HI> 23, 1792,</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON <HI>Thursday</HI> two letters were laid by Mr. <HI>Smalley</HI> before the commissioners of the <HI>Flint, Holywell,</HI> and <HI>Mostyn</HI> districts, signed D. <HI>Smith,</HI> and G. <HI>Boulton;</HI> in which our atten∣tion was requested to the repair of the roads which lay in our county in the course of the mail. It falls to my lot to desire you to com∣municate to your respectable corporation, what the commissioners have done, and what they in∣tend to do of their own proper motions, not from the fear of any of the very unbecoming menaces sent forth.</P>
<P>On the road from <HI>Holywell</HI> to the extremity of the district (which is called the <HI>Flint</HI>), has been
<PB N="25" REF="26"/>laid out, within two years, 9531. in the space of five miles: great part of which, long before the indictments, was in most admirable repair.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mostyn</HI> district begins at the western end of the <HI>Flint:</HI> much of it is in very good order: part is very indifferent, owing to the impo∣verished state of the <HI>Mostyn</HI> district, and to the inability of the poor inhabitants of the township in which <HI>Rhiallt-hill</HI> lies, to repair that part which is bad by nature. I propose a subscrip∣tion: you see my offer in the inclosed. We look up to the city of <HI>Chester,</HI> as both are en∣gaged in a common cause.</P>
<P>The <HI>Holywell</HI> district is, excepting near <HI>Halkin,</HI> in excellent repair. The part complained of will be attended to at the next meeting at <HI>Holywell,</HI> at eleven o'clock on <HI>Wednesday</HI> the 8th of <HI>Fe∣bruary.</HI> We shall be happy to see any gentle∣men on the part of your city.</P>
<P>Excuse me if I remind the city of <HI>Chester,</HI> the county, and also the county of <HI>Flint,</HI> that our
<PB N="26" REF="27"/>importance is such, that our demand of a mail is a matter of right; not a petition for favour. How superior is the justice of our claim to that of <HI>Salop,</HI> which had long since its independent mail!</P>
<P>In respect to my particular actings, I never will persist in any thing that is wrong; nor desist from any thing that is right. Our claim for abolishing the exemption from tolls is founded on common honesty. My seizing on the guard was the act of an attentive magistrate, to prevent future murders. Two, if not three, had been committed: one near <HI>Conwy;</HI> another in <HI>Anglesey:</HI> besides the terror spread along the whole road by the wanton conduct of the profligate guards. I brought the affair before our quarter-session; more to set it in the true light than to punish the offender. I was aspersed in your city; but the examination wiped away the dirty paragraph.</P>

<DATELINE><HI>Downing,</HI> <DATE><HI>August</HI> 6, 1791.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I REQUEST you to lay before the public the following advertisement, addressed by the com∣missioners of the <HI>Mostyn</HI> turnpike district, in order to avert in future the hardships several of the townships of the county of <HI>Flint</HI> labour un∣der in the repairs of the roads. The advertise∣ment itself relates to the greater part of the griev∣ances. It was sent to the paper too late to in∣form the <HI>English</HI> circuits, but has been approved by the grand juries of <HI>Cheshire, Denbighshire,</HI> and <HI>Flintshire,</HI> at the Spring assizes, and by that of <HI>Berkshire</HI> and <HI>Monmouthshire,</HI> being the first of the Autumn assizes. Let me here inform you, that, by indictments from the General Post-Office, fines to the amount of 1200l. have been laid on the several townships lying in the course of the post-roads in the little county of <HI>Flint,</HI> many of which are very
<PB N="28" REF="29"/>small, and labour under the greatest poverty. One in particular has a vast extent of road to repair, and only a few labourers, and four miser∣able teams to perform their statute labour. Un∣der those circumstances, terrified with the pro∣spect of ruin, they performed twenty-two days statute duty. The French <HI>corvées,</HI> now so rea∣sonably abolished, were introduced on British ground, yet in vain; for a fine of 82l.10s. was imposed on the poor people. So little interested were they, and numbers of others of the <HI>Welsh</HI> townships, in the passage of the mail-coach, that possibly they do not receive a letter in a year; yet these townships must suffer equally with the most opulent and commercial towns. Many of the roads were unexceptionably repaired; the rest were in sufficient repair for the uses of the farmer, for the uses of the gentlemen's carriages, and for the uses of the mail, before the late un∣guarded innovations. We are like the <HI>Israelites,</HI> required to make brick without straw. The means of repair are taken from us, and we are fined for not performing impossibilities. A post-road is a
<PB N="29" REF="30"/>national concern; that to a neighbouring king∣dom doubly so: and certainly that consideration should induce legislature to afford an aid in such cases in which it is found necessary; and if a road must be finished with finical perfection, the ex∣pence ought never to fall on those who are to∣tally uninterested in it. Justice can never require that the poor should keep pace with the innova∣tions made for the benefit of commerce or luxury. Much of the road-laws calls loudly for a reform: in all laws there should be a point of limitation. The attention of the grand juries is requested at the ensuing assizes. It is hoped that they will direct their representatives to make the mail∣coaches liable to tolls. We mean no injury to Mr. <HI>Palmer:</HI> let him, before the meeting of parliament, suggest any remedy for the evil, and we shall rest content. They will certainly do away the great parliamentary opprobrium of the act passed by their predecessors; which lessens a security granted on the faith of parliament. And much more may be said on this subject; but the detail is reserved for another occasion; you may
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>be again troubled with my complaints, as well as some account of a township grievance, brought on it by those whose peculiar office it was to have guarded against the deceptions which imposed on their judgment, and brought on a most erroneous and disgraceful adjudication.</P>

<PB N="31" REF="32"/>
<HEAD>"GENERAL TURNPIKE CONCERN.</HEAD>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>1. AT a meeting of the trustees of the <HI>Mostyn</HI> turnpike, held at the house of <HI>Joseph Roberts,</HI> at the <HI>Blue Bell,</HI> on <HI>Saturday, July</HI> 30, 1791, the state of the roads was taken into con∣sideration:</P>
<P>2. When it appeared, that parts of the coal-road were greatly out of repair; the trade in which was the original foundation of this turnpike.</P>
<P>3. That the present annual tolls are very inadequate to remedy the evil.</P>
<P>4. That the failure of the tolls does not arise from any decay of trade in the country, but from the exemption granted by parliament, by the 25th Geo. III. c. 57, to the mail-coaches from the payment of any tolls.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="33"/>5. That, by such exemption, the common stage-coaches have been obliged to desist from travelling, by reason of the burthen they are singly to sustain, and which the mail-coaches are freed from, and now in many places monopolize the business.</P>
<P>6. That the <HI>Mostyn</HI> district alone suffers a loss of 40l. a year, which is the interest of 800l. the loss of which prevents the trustees from the repairing of road equal to the expenditure of such a sum.</P>
<P>7. That the clause of exemption in favour ot the mail-coaches is highly detrimental to the credit of the tolls, and the security of the lenders, who had lent their money under the pledge of parliamentary faith.</P>
<P>8. Ordered, That the expediency of peti∣tioning parliament on this subject be farther taken into consideration, and that these reso∣lutions be published in the next <HI>Chester</HI> paper,
<PB N="33" REF="34"/>as they are public concerns; every post-road, and its several creditors, being interested therein.</P>
<P>9. That the sum of ten guineas be paid into the hands of the solicitor, towards the ex∣pences of the proposed bill, for repealing the exemption of tolls of the mail-coaches, and for subjecting them to tolls, in case such bill be brought into parliament: and that the commis∣sioners of the several turnpike districts in <HI>Great Britain</HI> be invited to correspond, by their trea∣surers, on the subject, with <HI>Samuel Small,</HI> treasurer of the <HI>Flint</HI> and <HI>Holywell</HI> districts, and <HI>John Lloyd,</HI> assistant treasurer of that of <HI>Mostyn.</HI></P>
<P>10. That the thanks of the commissioners be given to the foremen and grand juries of the counties of <HI>Cheshire, Denbighshire</HI> and <HI>Flintshire,</HI> for their liberal concurrence with the resolutions of the commissioners of the <HI>Mostyn</HI> district.</P>
<P>11. That it is requested of the gentlemen of this county to attend at <HI>Mold,</HI> on <HI>Saturday</HI> the 9th of <HI>April,</HI> to give a sanction to this proposal,
<PB N="34" REF="35" MS="y"/>and to prepare one or more petitions, or to give necessary instruction to the representatives of the county and borough, &amp;c. as may then be thought proper.</P>
<P>12. And in order to give force to this rea∣sonable claim on parliament, it is recommended to the gentlemen of neighbouring counties, who may attend the duty of their country on the ensuing grand juries, to take the above into consideration, and add their weight to the common cause. Signed, by order of the commissioners,</P></Q>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>JOHN LLOYD, <HI>Assistant Clerk and Treasurer.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
