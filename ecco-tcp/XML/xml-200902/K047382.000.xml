<P>THE idea of the Character of <HI>DRUGGET,</HI> in the following piece, was taken from a paper written by Mr. <HI>POPE,</HI> and published in the <HI>Guardian, No.</HI> 173. The reader will perceive some strictures of true humour from thence inserted in this little Comedy. The vio∣lent differences between <HI>Sir Charles</HI> and <HI>Lady Rackett</HI> about a trifle, and the renewal of those differences by venturing, after they had subsided, to resume the object in thorough good humour, are, it is conceived, founded in Na∣ture, because similar incidents often occur in real life. To shew the passions thus frivol∣ously agitated, and to point out the ridicule springing from their various turns and shift∣ings, was the main drift of the ensuing scenes. But some people were determined not to hear, and the Author could not be induced by any pri∣vate motives to send the Performers a second time into so painful a service as that of the Stage always is, when a few are unwilling to be entertained.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">P</SEG>O! Po!—no such thing—I tell you, Mr. Woodley, you are a mere novice in these affairs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wood.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but listen to reason. Mrs. Dimity—has not your master, Mr. Drugget, invited me down to his country-house, in order to give me his daughter Nancy in marriage; and with what pre∣tence can he now break off?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>What pretence! — you put a body out of all patience—but go on your own way, Sir; my advice is all lost upon you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wood.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come now, do me justice—have not I fix'd an interest in the young lady's heart?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>An interest in a fiddlestick?—You ought to have made love to the father and
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>mother—what, do you think the way to get a wise, is by speaking fine things to the lady you've a fancy for?—That was the practice, indeed, but things are alter'd now—you must address the old people, Sir; and never trouble your head about your mistress—None of your letters, and verses, and soft looks, and fine speeches,—"Have compassion, thou angelic crea∣ture, on a poor, dying"—Pshaw! stuff! nonsense! all out of fashion.—Go your ways to the old Curmudgeon, humour his whims—"I shall esteem it an honour, Sir, to be allied to a gentleman of your rank and taste." "Upon my word, he's a pretty young gentleman."—Then wheel about to the mother: "Your daughter, Ma'am, is the very model of you, and I shall adore her for your sake." "Here, come hither, Nancy, take this gentleman for better for worse." "La, Mama, I can never consent."—"I should not have thought of your consent—the consent of your relations is enough: why how now, Hussey!—So away you go to church, the knot is tied, and you quarrel like contrary elements all the rest of your lives—that's the way of the world now."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wood.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you know, my dear Dimity, the old couple have received every mark of mention from me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Attention! to be sure you did not fall asleep in their company; but what then?—You should have entered into their cha∣racters, play'd with their humours, and sa∣crificed to their absurdities.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wood.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bat if my temper is too frank—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Frank, indeed! I hate the word, except when I receive a letter.—Have not you to do with a rich old shopkeeper, re∣tired from business with an hundred thou∣sand pounds in his pocket, to enjoy the dust of the London road, which he calls living in the country—and yet you must find fault with his situation!—What if he has made a ridiculous gimcrack of his house and gardens, you know his heart is set up∣on it; and could not you have commended his taste? But you must be too frank!—"Those walks and alleys are too regular—those evergreens should not be cut into such fantastic shapes."—And thus you ad∣vise a poor old mechanic, who delights in every thing that's monstrous, to follow nature—Oh, you're likely to be a success∣ful lover!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wood.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why should not I save a father-in-law from being a laughing-stock?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Make him your father-in-law first—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wood.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why he can't open his windows for the dust—he stands all day looking thro' a pane of glass; and he calls that living in the fresh air, and enjoying his own thoughts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Po! Po!—you have ruin'd your∣self by talking sense to him; and all your nonsense to the daughter won't make amends for it.—And then the mother; how have you play'd your car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in that quarter?—She wants a tinsel man of fashion for her second daughter—"Don't you see <STAGE>(says she)</STAGE> how happy my eldest girl is made by marrying Sir Charles Rackett—Nancy shall have a man of quality too."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wood.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet I know Sir Charles Rac∣kett perfectly well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, so do I; and I know he'll make his lady wretched at last—But what then? You should have humour'd the old folks, —you should have been a talking empty fop, to the good old lady; and to the old gentleman, an admirer of his taste in gardening. But you have lost him—he is grown fond of this beau Lovelace, that's here in the house with him; the coxcomb ingratiates himself by flattery, and you're undone by frankness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wood.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, Dimity, I won't despair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet you have reason, a million of reasons—To-morrow is fix'd for the wedding-day; Sir Charles and his lady are to be here this very night—they are engag'd, indeed, at a great rout in town, but they take a bed here, not withstanding.—The family is fitting up for them; Mr. Drugget will keep ye all up, in the next room there
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>till they arrive—and to-morrow the business is over—and yet you don't, despair!—Hush!—, hold your tongue; here he comes, and Lovelace with him.—Step this way with me, and, I'll devise something, I warrant you.—'Tis enough to vex a body, to see an old father and mother marrying their daugh∣ter as they please, in spite of all I can do.</P>

<P>And so you like my house and gardens, Mr. Lovelace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Love.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! perfectly, Sir; they gratify my taste of all things. One sees villas where nature reigns in a wild kind of simplicity; but then they have no appearance of art, no art at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, rightly distinguish'd:—now mine is all art; no wild nature here; I did it all myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Love.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, had you none of the great proficients in gardening to assist you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lackaday! no, —ha! ha! I did it all myself—I love my garden. The front of my house, Mr. Lovelace, is not that very pretty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Love.</SPEAKER>
<P>Elegant to a degree!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't you like the sun-dial, plac'd just by my dining-room windows?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Love.</SPEAKER>
<P>A perfect beauty!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>I knew you'd like it—and the motto is so well adapted—<HI>Tempus edax, &amp; index rorum.</HI> And I know the meaning of it—Time eateth and discovereth all things—ha! ha!—pretty, Mr. Lovelace!—I have seen people so stare at it as they pass by—ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Love.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why now I don't believe there's a nobleman in the kingdom has such a thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh no—they have got into a false taste.—I bought that bit of ground, the ether side of the road—and it looks very pretty—I made a duck-pond there, for the lake of the prospect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Love.</SPEAKER>
<P>Charmingly imagin'd!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>My leaden images are well—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Love.</SPEAKER>
<P>They exceed ancient statuary.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>I love to be surpriz'd at the turn∣ing of a walk with an inanimate figure, that looks you full in the face, and can say no∣thing to you, while one is enjoying one's own thoughts—ha! ha!—Mr. Lovelace, I'll point out a beauty to you—Just by the haw-haw, at the end of my ground, there is a fine Dutch figure, with a scythe in his hand, and a pipe in his mouths—that's a jewel, Mr. Lovelace.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Love.</SPEAKER>
<P>That escap'd me: a thousand thanks for pointing it out—I observe you have two very fine yew-trees before the house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lackaday, Sir! they look un∣couth—I have a design about them—I in∣tend
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>—ha! ha! it will, be very pretty, Mr. Lovelace—I intendto have them cut into the shape of the two giants at Guild-hall—ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Love.</SPEAKER>
<P>Exquisite!—Why then they won't look like trees,—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, no, no—not at all—I won't have any thing in my garden that looks like what it is—ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Love.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nobody understands these things like you, Mr. Drugget.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lackaday! it's all my delight now—this is what I have been working for. I have a great improvement to make still—I propose to have my evergreens cut into for∣tifications! and then I shall have the Moro castle, and the Havanna; and then near it shall be ships of myrtle, failing upon seas of box to attack the town: won't that make my place look very rural, Mr. Lovelace?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Love.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you have the most fertile in∣vention, Mr. Drugget.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! this is what I have been working for. I love my garden—but I must beg your pardon for a few moments—I must step and speak with a famous nursery-man, who is come to offer me some choice things—Do go and join the company, Mr. Lovelace—my daughter Rackett and Sir Charles will be here presently—I shan't go to bed till I see 'em—ha! ha!
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>—I did all this myself, Mr. Lovelace—this is what I have been working for—I fin'd for Sheriff to enjoy these things—ha! ha!</P>
<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Love.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor Mr. Drugget! Mynheer Van Thundertentrunck, in his little box at the side of a dyke, has as much taste and ele∣gance.—However, if I can but carry off his daughter, if I can rob his garden of that flower—why then I shall say, "This is what I have been working for."</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> DIMITY.</STAGE>
<SP>

<P>Do lend us your assistance, Mr. Lovelace—you're a sweet gentleman, and love a good-natur'd action.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Love.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why how now! what's the matter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>My master is going to cut the two yew-trees into the shape of two devils, I believe; and my poor mistress is breaking her heart for it.—Do, run and advise him against it—she is your friend, you know she is, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Love.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, if that's all—I'll make that matter easy directly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>My mistress will be for ever oblig'd to you; and you'll marry her daughter in the morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Love.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, my rhetoric shall dissuade him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, Sir, put him against dealing with that nursery-man; Mrs. Drugget hates him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER>Love.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does she?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Say no more, the business is done.</P>
<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>If he says one word, old Drugget will never forgive him.—My brain was at it's last shift; but if this plot takes—So, here comes our Nancy.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Dimity, what's to become of me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>My stars! what makes you up, Miss?—I thought you were gone to bed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nan.</SPEAKER>
<P>What should I go to bed for? only to tumble and toss, and fret, and be uneasy—they are going to marry me, and I am frighted out of my wits.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then you're the only young lady within fifty miles round, that would be frighten'd at such a thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! if they would let me chuse for myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't you like Mr. Lovelace?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nan.</SPEAKER>
<P>My mama does, but I don't; I don't mind his being a man of fashion, not I.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, pray, can you do better than follow the fashion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! I know there's a fashion for dressing the hair, and a fashion for new
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>bonnets—but I never heard of a fashion for the heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, my dear, the heart mostly follows the fashion now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does it?—Pray who sets the fashion of the heart?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>All the fine ladies in London, o'my conscience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nan.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what's the last new fashion, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why to marry any fop, that has a few deceitful agreeable appearances about him; something of a pert phrase, a good ope∣rator for the teeth, and a tolerable taylor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nan.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do they marry without lov∣ing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! marrying for love has been a great while out of fashion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then I'll wait till that fashion comes up again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>And then, Mr. Lovelace, I reckon—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pshaw! I don't like him: he talks to me as if he was the most miserable man in the world, and the confident thing looks so pleas'd with himself all the while.—I want to marry for love, and not for card-playing—I should not be able to bear the life my sister leads with Sir Charles Rackett—and I'll forfeit my new cap, if they don't quarrel soon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll be sworn they will—but what say you then to Mr. Woodley?</P>

<L>What could induce him in an age so nice—</L>
<L>So fam'd for virtue, so refin'd from vice,</L>
<L>To form a plan so trivial, false, and low?</L>
<L>As if a belle could quarrel with a beau:</L>

<L>Fray tell me, Sirs—(for I don't know, I vow,)</L>
<L>Pray—is there such a thing as Gaming now?</L>
<L>Do peers make laws against that giant Vice,</L>
<L>And then at Arthur's break them in a trice?</L>
<L>No—no—our lives are virtuous all, austere and hard;—</L>

<L>Those empty boxes shew you don't love plays;</L>
<L>The managers, poor souls! get nothing now a days.</L>
<L>If here you come—by chance—but once a week,</L>
<L>The pit can witness that you never speak:</L>
<L>Pensive Attention sits with decent mien;</L>
<L>No paint, no naked shoulders to be seen!</L>
<L>And yet this grave, this moral, pious age,</L>
<L>May learn one useful lesson from the stage.</L>
<L>Shun strife, ye fair, and once a contest o'er,</L>
<L>Wake to a blaze the dying flame no more—</L>
<L><PB N="52" REF="55"/>From fierce debate sly all the tender Love,</L>
<L>And Venus cries, "Coachman, —Put-to my doves."</L>
