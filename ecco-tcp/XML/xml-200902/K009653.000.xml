<HEAD>A CONTINUATION OF THE HISTORY, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>O many things of consequence offer at this time, that I find I shall swell my Design to a much greater length than I imagined: Instead of Writing once a Week, I shall never be able to retain so many memorable Particulars, or get thro' my Promise, without adjusting the Substance every Post.</P>
<P>You would split your Sides at the late Set of Servants, and their <HI>Favourers,</HI> in this Town, were you to see how they behave themselves in their present Circumstances?
<PB N="4" REF="3" MS="y"/>
What a mixture they discover in their Coun∣tenances of the Sullen and the Impertinent; or indeed of the Spaniel and the Lion. They wou'd fain lay a timely claim to the good Graces and Favour of Mr. <HI>WRIGHT,</HI> but their Pretensions are awkardly made out, and built on such senceless Foundations, that 'tis queer enough to hear them explain 'em.</P>
<P><HI>Harry Aucumy,</HI> who is at leizure now to carry on all the Intrigues that lay upon his Hands, has had a very great Levee of Condo∣lants since his late Misfortune; for say they, <HI>Harry</HI> appeared a Man of Spirit, and was al∣ways firm to his <HI>Purpose. Harry</HI> was resolute and constant in the Measures he pursued, and wou'd have pushed Things with another man∣ner of Spirit than that unaccountable Fellow <HI>Slyboots</HI> shew'd, <HI>who had been asleep for three Years,</HI> and always kept his <HI>Friends</HI> as well as his <HI>Enemies</HI> in doubt what he designed. <HI>Harry</HI> was the Life of the <HI>Cause,</HI> the Joy of the Par∣ty, and the Toast of the <HI>CLUB.</HI> From <HI>Har∣ry</HI> we expected something very great and sur∣prizing; he had a Spirit and Impudence really fitted for it. Our hopes in him daily increas∣ed; we saw him, on <HI>Robin</HI>'s Downfal, which was owing to his dextrous Conduct, placed in a Sphere, whereby his excellent Talents wou'd have come to shine in their full Lu∣stre; nay, he had manag'd it so admirably, that he sent the Trickster <HI>Robin</HI> off the Stage
<PB N="5" REF="4" MS="y"/>
with the utmost Disgrace, which for Reasons well known to us, would have proved of Ser∣vice to future Purposes.</P>
<P>But I must not stay to finish the <HI>Encomiuns</HI> these Visitants of <HI>Harry</HI>'s bestow'd on him, without letting you know, that they were such Friends of young <HI REND="blackletterType">Shute</HI>'s, as began to place the greatest Confidence in him, from the several steps which they plainly saw he had taken in his Favour. The rest were such as <HI>Harry</HI> had really let into the Secret; and among whom there ran a mutu∣al and entire Chain of Confidence, in which they wou'd all rather have Hang'd together, than to have broke their Faith with one another.</P>
<P>Must it not therefore be the most sensible Mortification to Men elated with such Hopes, and inspired by a <HI>Genius</HI> so very promising as <HI>Harry</HI>'s to promote their Views, to see him at two Steps fall headlong from such an Emi∣nence of Power and Authority, and lye the bleeding Sacrifice of a <HI>Ruined-Party</HI> at the Feet of his Enemies, despis'd, threaten'd and level'd to their Resentments by the Act of the new <HI>LANDLORD,</HI> who singled him out, like a Deer for the Chace, to be the common Sport of all the honest Servants and Tenants; nay, even to his Antagonist <HI>Robin?</HI> What can shew a Man more despis'd than the Mes∣sage
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
delivered him by the <HI>TRUSTEES</HI> for his Dismission.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. <HI>Aucumy,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Your Proceedings having rendered your Con∣duct suspected, we are Order'd by our new LANDLORD Mr. WRIGHT to tell you, that he has no farther Service for you; with Directions likewise to take from you your Books of Accounts, and Seal up the COUNTING-HOUSE.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>You may be sure his Friends bleed inwardly for him; but they have, indeed, the most admirable way of out-facing Things that e∣ver was known. They had before this given out, that he stood on no bad terms with Mr. WRIGHT, and chiefly, that on the first In∣disposition of the <HI>Widdow,</HI> it was he who pro∣moted the Delivery of <HI>BOB</HI>'s <HI>Conjuring-VVand</HI> into the Hands of the <HI>Chamberlain;</HI> which He could not chuse but acknowledge as a piece of good Service: But this is some∣what like <HI>BOB</HI>'s <HI>INVIOLABLE ATTACH.</HI></P>
<P>This they maintain'd with an Assurance peculiar to them, till the time of <HI>Harry</HI>'s dis∣grace, when a fresh Astonishment appeared in them; and for two or three Days there was a general run of <HI>Guilty</HI> confused Faces a∣mong
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
the Party, <HI>Harry</HI> himself stood this shock with a great deal of outward Confi∣dence before his Friends, because he was un∣willing to discourage them, but alas we know that nothing but a clear and unspotted Con∣science can really support a Man's Spirits un∣der such sudden and capital Afflictions. This required that they should give their Senti∣ments a new turn, and now <HI>Harry</HI> was conso∣led by his Friends as a Man purely suffering for his Principles, and one who deserved all the Confidence they had placed in him.</P>
<P>One wou'd think this Indication should have taught them a little Modesty, but they go on at the old rate: They will not stand convinced that they have a less share of the Favour of Mr. WRIGHT than others, tho' it is with the utmost Impudence and Vanity they dare, even make Pretences to it. They are the most impatient People at the loss of Power imaginable, and certainly make the worst use of it when they have it of any living, for they are all Heat and Choler: whence it is observable, thro' their precipitate and Post∣haste Fury, that they have never been long before they finished their Course.</P>
<P>They have the merriest Way of Inter∣preting Things that can be: They pretend they are very impatient for the arrival of the New LANDLORD, being uneasie at
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
the Management of the TRUSTEES, who have gone a great way toward putting the Affairs of the <HI>INN</HI> in a better Posture, and to draw a better Trade to the whole <HI>Town.</HI> They cannot, or rather will not be∣lieve, that the Choice of the TRUSTEES has any thing of the true Meaning of Mr. WRIGHT in it; but that it was done up∣on their own Solicitations and Intelligence; and that they doubt not, <HI>but they shall soon convince him when they come to talk with him.</HI></P>
<P>Wou'd it not anger one that these Fel∣lows should have the Impudence to form these preposterous Suggestions? (for I will forgive the Folly of it) Do they think he has forgot, or ever will, their turning two or three of his Servants out of the House in a rude Sort of Manner, though they paid ho∣nestly for what they called for, only because they gave their Master Notice of their In∣trigues? Was any thing more grosly Impu∣dent than <HI>Harry</HI>'s Conduct in this Matter? Or his inspiring the CLUB to do all they could to hinder <HI>Young Mr. VVright</HI> from coming among them? They are mistaken if they think him a Person so short-sighted as to be deceived in distinguishing his <HI>Friends</HI> from his <HI>Foes:</HI> And if those who have al∣ways appeared in his Interest, and on all Oc∣casions justified their Love to him, are not to
<PB N="9" REF="8" MS="y"/>
be intitled to his Favour; nay, if his own Sence of this, in chusing such for TRUS∣TEES, is not sufficient to prove it, I leave them to be corrected by their own Folly.</P>
<P>Every Reed serves a drowning Man to catch at; you wou'd smile, did you but know the mighty Splutter they make, that their Consort, <HI>Tom Scatterwit,</HI> has shook Hands with Mr. WRIGHT. Now you must know there is no more in it than this. <HI>Tom</HI> was Agent for the Widow at <HI>NICK FROG</HI>'s, especially on the Composition: <HI>Tom,</HI> like the rest of his Fraternity, was a very active furious Fellow, and when Reason wou'd not do, he used to cock his Hat, and tread upon <HI>NICK</HI>'s Toes. <HI>NICK</HI> made damn'd sour Faces, but was not able to cope with the young Bully. <HI>Nick,</HI> in his Time had been a very sturdy Fellow, but he was then cursedly pinched with Corns, and could hardly stir out of his Elbow-Chair: 'Tis true, he kicked and winced a little, but <HI>Tom</HI> always turned him by main Strength, and in the End work'd him into Temper to con∣sent quietly to the Agreement. <HI>Tom,</HI> on the <HI>Widow</HI>'s Death, lay under dreadful Appre∣hensions; he was conscious that a very good Understanding wou'd ensue between Mr. WRIGHT and <HI>NICK;</HI> and that if <HI>NICK</HI> should remember the Smart of his Toes, it wou'd prove but a little queer for him.
<PB N="10" REF="9" MS="y"/>
<HI>Tom</HI> therefore came to <HI>NICK,</HI> and shewed a geat deal of unusual Condescension. In∣stead of the Bully Cock, he now came Cap in Hand, and entered into an Expostulation somewhat servile. He desir'd <HI>NICK</HI> to for∣get old Grudges, and to make the best of Matters to Mr. WRIGHT. <HI>NICK</HI> looked a little sour on him, as remembering the cursed Gripes he had given him; howe∣ver, like a Man of Honour, he told him he forgave him, and should be glad to hear of his Conversion. Another thing likewise laid <HI>Tom</HI>'s Friends under some Apprehensions for him; he was dipped in <HI>Harry</HI>'s Project of entering into a League with Old <HI REND="blackletterType">Savage</HI> and his Grandson, tending to the Prejudice of Mr. WRIGHT's Interest; and had un∣luckily written for further Orders therein just at the Time of the Widow's Death; which Pacquet falling of course into the Hands of the TRUSTEES, they sealed it up, and sent it to Mr. WRIGHT.</P>
<P>Poor <HI>Tom</HI> looked plaguy queer upon it at first; but it seems he has had a long Conference with Mr. WRIGHT on his arrival at <HI>NICK FROG</HI>'s; which his Friends interpret strangely to his Advantage; not that they think <HI>Tom</HI> will prove very Stanch, but that they love a Fellow of a predominant Spirit. Most People laugh hear∣tily at this, and say, that <HI>Tom,</HI> who is an ex∣cellent
<PB N="11" REF="10" MS="y"/>
Fellow at <HI>Congee</HI> and <HI>Grimace,</HI> took all Opportunities to wriggle himself into Mr. WRIGHT's Acquaintance, and screw'd in at the lower End of the Table to Dinner.</P>
<P><HI>Nick Spitfire,</HI> was to have played the same Game at 'Squire <HI>SOUTH</HI>'s, but the 'Squire being a Man of Spirit forbid <HI>Nick</HI> the House, and resolved to receive no Message from the Widow by such Hands; which put <HI>Nick</HI> up∣on the Splutter for losing so favourable an Opportunity of exerting himself.</P>
<P><HI>Bob Bungey</HI> is selling his Equipage again, sensibly afflicted at the Miscarriage of his Bu∣siness to <HI REND="blackletterType">Phil. Baboon. Bob</HI> breeds excel∣lent Bullocks, and has got Money by it; but was never looked on to be a Fellow of any tollerable Sence.</P>
<P><HI>Matt Spindleshanks,</HI> the Tavern-Boy, is in a strange Quandary whether he shall return Home, or stay at Old <HI>Savage</HI>'s. 'Tis noted for excellent Air in a Consumption, and 'tis very probable that <HI>Matt,</HI> who is a little in∣firm, will chuse it for his Health's Sake. Life is sweet, and 'tis very probable that the late Damps that have happened in this Country may be apt to suffocate poor <HI>Matt,</HI> so that his Physicians have advised him, that the other Air is more safe for him.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11" MS="y"/>
<HI>Peregriue Scamper,</HI> who makes such a migh∣ty Noise of his CONDUCT, is lately return'd from his last <HI>Errand.</HI> He pleads a great deal of Merit, and is angry he was not nam'd one of the TRUSTEES. To say Truth, the Man had had never much Harm in him, but being always thought a little Troublesome at Home, was usually sent out of the Way for Quietness Sake. Most Peo∣ple would believe he had done some Service, if he talk'd Jess of it, and had shewn less Compliance to some Points which render him a little disagreeable.</P>
<P><HI>Jacob Rash,</HI> the New Agent, is the less concerned at being shut out of the Manage∣ment of all Affairs at the INN, because it furnishes him with an Opportunity to indulge himself in a voluptuous Life. He was a zealous Promoter of <HI>Harry</HI>'s New Scheme, and a great Closeter of the BUFF-COATS upon that Occasion. <HI>Jacob</HI> has lost his for∣mer Reputation, and has the Misfortune of being looked on as a Tool, when perhaps too much Indolence and good Nature only has been his Fault.</P>
<P>Old <HI>Biass</HI> the Malster, has a greater Incli∣nation than a Spirit to do Mischief: Cove∣tousness, which is in others a Crime, has in him proved a Virtue. He wou'd have gone
<PB N="13" REF="12" MS="y"/>
greater lengths in Young <HI REND="blackletterType">Shute</HI>'s Favour, but for the excessive dread of losing his Pelf: Besides, he saw no reason why he should Em∣bark on a Level with Fellows of desperate Fortunes. <HI>Biass</HI> dropt them in several Im∣portant Points, and cry'd, <HI>Safe's the Word:</HI> He was willing to come in for something a∣mong them, but wou'd not run the Hazard of losing one of his G—s for ne'er a Cause in <HI>Christendom;</HI> so that People say, <HI>Though he is no very honest Man, yet he has proved an excel∣lent BOWLER.</HI></P>
<P>I know no one lies more exposed than <HI>Sim</HI> the Scrivener: <HI>Sim</HI>'s Principles prevailed over his Gratitude, to shew his good Inclinations to Young <HI REND="blackletterType">Shute.</HI> 'Tis whispered, that he has already receiv'd his <HI>Quietus;</HI> and no doubt but a Post or two more will confirm it. <HI>Will Bromingham,</HI> notwithstanding his great Pretences, looks with a very formidable dull Air. He wou'd fain be thought to merit his Place, but I hear Mr. WRIGHT is of ano∣ther Opinion.</P>
<P><HI>BOB</HI> and <HI>Harry Aucumy</HI> are as far from being Friends as ever: <HI>Bob</HI> has lost his Re∣putation with both Parties, but <HI>Harry</HI> stands fair with one side at least. In short, <HI>Harry</HI> appears most Guilty, but <HI>Bob</HI> has the more despicable Phiz.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="13" MS="y"/>
<HI>Will Wildfire</HI> would be a solitary Fellow too if he was capable of thinking; but that is what he never did in his Life: He is a great Comforter to <HI>Harry</HI> under his Afflicti∣on, and talks mightily of his Interest in a certain Family he is allied to by Marriage, that are like to come into Favour; but a Bottle I believe is the more solid consolation of the two.</P>
<P><HI>Arthur Skipkennel</HI> has packed up his Move∣ables and is ready for the Scamper. <HI>Con</HI>—is turned out of the <HI>West</HI> Farm by the TRUSTEES. A Fellow that has done a damn'd deal of Mischief to the Country there. More of this in my next.</P>
<P><HI>Tom Dimple</HI> has recovered his former Repu∣tation. <HI>Tom</HI> you must know, was pitched on to carry Instructions to <HI>Jacob Rush,</HI> in relati∣on to <HI>stifling the Evidence,</HI> mentioned in my last. <HI>Tom,</HI> thought he had been sent to in∣fluence the CAUSE; but by a cursed Ar∣tifice found, that <HI>Bob</HI> and <HI>Harry</HI> had sealed his Packet up. <HI>Tom</HI> was chose <HI>Steward</HI> at the next CLUB, and has shewn himself a very honest Friend of Mr. WRIGHT's.</P>
<P>Honest <HI>Charles Barrier</HI> is made Clerk of the Brewhouse in <HI>Harry</HI>'s Room, which is highly Satisfactory to all honest Men here;
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
and no doubt is an Instance of Mr. WRIGHT's Esteem to <HI>Nick Frog,</HI> and to take off the Odi∣um of his Conduct in concert with <HI>Charles,</HI> when the CLUB at the INN, in the <HI>VVidow's</HI> Time fell foul on him in opprobious Words; and had like to have sent <HI>Charles</HI> to the <HI>Stocks</HI> for the <HI>Bargain</HI> he made with <HI>Nick</HI> in relation to some <HI>Copses</HI> and <HI>Inclosures</HI> on <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>South</HI>'s Estate, which were to be put in∣to <HI>NICK</HI>'s Occupation; wherein <HI>Charles,</HI> as they alledged, suffer'd him to infringe on a TURNIP FIELD or two of the <HI>VVi∣dow</HI>'s</P>
<P>Never was Man so joyfully caressed and en∣tertained as Mr. WRIGHT was at <HI>NICK</HI>'s House; both he, and all his <HI>Tenants</HI> were ready to devour him for Joy. And indeed, to say Truth, <HI>NICK</HI> had a great deal of Rea∣son for his Exaltation, for he had been used but a little scurvily in the latter part of the <HI>VVidow</HI>'s Days. Many of the New Servants hated him in their Hearts; and 'twas feared, that to bring about some other Design, they wou'd not have stuck to persuade the <HI>VVidow</HI> into a Law Suit against poor <HI>NICK.</HI> But these Fears are all cured now, and <HI>NICK</HI> begins to speak and act with his usual Spirit again.</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>THE swift Current of Affairs at this Time, will not let me, I find, con∣clude without a <HI>Postscript.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Jacob Rush</HI> is dismist from the Agency and honest <HI>John Trusty</HI> has got his Place again. <HI>John</HI> met Mr. WRIGHT on the Road, and wishing him Joy on his Accessi∣on to the Estate; Mr. WRIGHT an∣swer'd, <HI>That he was satisfied a great deal was owing to him on that Occasion; and he should always very gratefully remember his Ser∣vices.</HI></P>
<P>This Day Mr. WRIGHT arrived in Town: Nothing can express the great Joy and Satisfaction of the People: He was met
<PB N="17" REF="16" MS="y"/>
by the Heads of the Town, and conducted to the <HI>INN</HI> thro' Crowds of Spectators, making loud Acclamations.</P>
<P>I just now learn that <HI>Harry Aucumy</HI> is sent for to be present at the opening of the COUNT∣ING-HOUSE; and that he comes with a hea∣vy splenetick Air. The same Hand informs me, that poor <HI>Sim</HI> has receiv'd a very civil Message from Mr. WRIGHT, to desire his Absence from the House, to make room for honest <HI>WILL</HI> the <HI>COOPER.</HI> A Man that can <HI>SEE</HI> a little farther into a Mil∣stone than the other. <HI>Sim</HI> takes his misfor∣tune very heavily; and some queer Fellows that used to write Hackney under him, are like to be reduced to the Circumstance of wanting Heels to their Shoes again. These scurvy Dogs had just as much Love for Mr. WRIGHT as their Master.</P>
<P>I am likewise credibly informed that <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>HEAD-OSTLER, Ned Top∣sail,</HI> and several other of the honest old Ser∣vants will have their Places again at the <HI>INN.</HI> The House begins to flourish, and none are to be admitted but what are known to be Men that have always promoted its Inte∣rest.</P>
<P>I must now finish, for every moment almost brings me some fresh Particular, and I ne'er
<PB N="18" REF="17" MS="y"/>
should have done if I waited for any Conclu∣sive Period.</P>
<P>I wish this may come safe to your Hands; for the <HI REND="blackletterType">Post-Boy</HI> is such a damn'd impudent Rascal, one is hardly <HI REND="blackletterType">Abel</HI> to express it. The Dog sold Ballads up and down the Town be∣fore, and now sets up for Writing News Letters. He was a great Lurker about <HI>Har∣ry</HI>'s <HI>Office,</HI> and 'tis thought, has convey'd many a private Packet for him to Young <HI REND="blackletterType">Shute.</HI> He has been often basted for his scurrilous sawcy Tongue, without any Effect, but 'tis very probable we shall now bring him to the <HI>VVhipping-Post.</HI> When <HI>VVill Broming∣ham</HI> troops off, he will be forbid coming near the INN; and we hope then to rid the Town of such a scurrilous Varlet.</P>
<P>Even whilst I am Writing this short Post∣script, there is News of other numerous Changes at the INN, but I cannot enter into Particulars till my next.</P>
<P>Honest <HI>Dan. Sobersides</HI> is popp'd into old <HI>Biass</HI>'s TWO-ARM'D-CHAIR, at the CLUB. <HI>Jemmy Brisk,</HI> one of the pret∣tiest Fellows in Town, is made <HI>Chief Clerk</HI> in the room of <HI>VVill. Bromingham.</HI></P>
<P>You may perhaps not give this Article its full Weight, but I can assure you 'tis meant
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
as a distant Compliment to 'Squire SOUTH. <HI>Jemmy</HI> is one he has a particular Esteem for; and his Preferment is an Argument that a good Understanding is renewed with the <HI>'Squire.</HI> I believe you'll soon see Young <HI REND="blackletterType">Shute</HI> removed to a little farther Distance from the Estate. If I don't conclude now, I never shall.</P>
