<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author of these poetical Attempts, begs Leave to say, that she should not have printed them, but that she is precluded from all Hopes of ever seeing the Tragedy brought upon the Stage, by there having been two so lately on the same Subject. If her's should be found to have any greater Resemblance to the two represented, than the Same∣ness of the Story made unavoidable, of which she is not conscious, it must have been accidental on her side, as there are many Persons, of very distin∣guished Rank, and unquestionable Veracity, who saw her's in Manuscript before the others appeared, and will witness for her, that she has taken no advan∣tage of having seen them. She must here do Mr. <HI>Crisp</HI> the Justice to say, that any Resemblance must have been equally accidental on his part, as he neither did, nor could see her <HI>Virginia</HI> before his own was play'd;
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> having declined reading her's, till Mr. <HI>Crisp's</HI> was published.</P>
<P>She is sensible of the Danger of appearing in Print, and of the many Imperfections in these Pieces; but hopes, her Sex, and the early Time of Li'e at which most of them were wrote, will plead her Excuse; she asks no more, than to be read with the fame Candor and Indulgence with which she herself reads the Productions of others.</P>
<P>One thing more she begs Leave to say, that she was greatly encouraged to this Publication, by the favora∣ble Reception three Odes of her's met with, which were inserted in a weekly Paper called <HI>The Old Maid:</HI> as this Volume may possibly come into the Hands of Persons who are Strangers to the Paper, she has re∣printed those Odes with the others.</P>
<P>And now, invoking the Powers for friendly Gales, she ventures to launch her little Bark into the wide Sea of Criticism, and <Q>Trembling quits the Shore.</Q></P>

<SPEAKER>NUMITORIUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>WEEP not, Virginia, all shall yet be well;</L>
<L>Now by my Sister's Shade, thy virtuous Mother,</L>
<L>I swear the Tyrant shall not force thee from us;</L>
<L>Why shou'dst thou fear his Power? the Monster dares not,</L>
<L>Howe'er he hop'd with Threats to move thy Soul,</L>
<L>Attempt to violate a free-born Virgin.</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="11"/>
But say, Virginia, did not Appius try</L>
<L>Each softer Method to seduce thy Virtue,</L>
<L>E'er his stern Fury rose to threaten Force?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VIRGINIA.</SPEAKER>
<L>O Sir! with all the Blandishments of Vice</L>
<L>He first essay'd my Youth. With offer'd Power,</L>
<L>And Vows of tenderest Passion, he protested,</L>
<L>That did not his own Law forbid his Purpose,</L>
<L>He wou'd divorce the Partner of his Bed,</L>
<L>And place me there.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NUMITORIUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>His Law! The Gods are just,</L>
<L>And on himself retort his Insolence;</L>
<L>Yes, let him sigh for a Plebeian Maid,</L>
<L>And sigh in vain: by Heaven 'tis righteous Ven∣geance.</L>
<L>But does he talk of Laws? He, who has broke</L>
<L>Through every sacred Bond? Who, on Pretence,</L>
<L>Of framing Laws, has bid them all Defiance,</L>
<L>And owns no Obligation but his Will?</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="12"/>
Is this our Legislator? But proceed:</L>
<L>Tell me, Virginia, did he dare to offer</L>
<L>Terms of Disgrace and Shame?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VIRGINIA.</SPEAKER>
<L>O Numitorius!</L>
<L>Spare my Confusion—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NUMITORIUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>I trust, Virginia, you receiv'd his Love</L>
<L>With all the Pride of Virtue, all the Scorn,</L>
<L>And strong Resentment, of a Roman Maid</L>
<L>Who loves her Honour and her Liberty.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VIRGINIA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yes, fired with generous Rage, and fierce Disdain,</L>
<L>I told him, were he free, his Law repeal'd,</L>
<L>Himself the Son of Jove, I wou'd reject</L>
<L>His lawful Vows, and think the brave Icilius</L>
<L>Superior to the Tyrant of his Country.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>NUMITORIUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>How bore he this?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>VIRGINIA.</SPEAKER>
<L>He stood a Moment speechless,</L>
<L>Then, his Eyes flaming, wild with mad Revenge,</L>
<L>And disappointed Love, 'Tis well, he cry'd,</L>
<L>My Power may reach you yet, remember, Maid,</L>
<L>You have not now your Tribunes to protect you;</L>
<L>Appius is Lord of Rome: then sudden turn'd,</L>
<L>And left me dead with Terror, for too well</L>
<L>I know his Power, and tremble for my Honor.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NUMITORIUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why was this base Attempt at first conceal'd?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VIRGINIA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Alas! I fear'd Icilius' Warmth of Temper;</L>
<L>I knew his Love, and his impatient Spirit,</L>
<L>And hop'd my Scorn wou'd cure the Tyrant's Passion.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NUMITORIUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Fear not, Virginia, soon our Roman Legions</L>
<L>Shall drive these rash Invaderst rembling back;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="14"/>
And crown'd with Laurel, midst his Fellow Soldiers,</L>
<L>Thy Father shall return to join thy Hand</L>
<L>With young Icilius, and secure thy Virtue:</L>
<L>The holy Marriage Bed the wildest Nations,</L>
<L>E'en savage Gauls, regard with sacred Awe.</L>

<L>Obedience to my Leader,</L>
<L>And Shame to see the Roman Legions fly:</L>
<L>Cornelius sends by me for fresh Supplies</L>
<L>To stop the conquering Equan Troops: Tomorrow</L>
<L>May bring them to these Walls. O, Numitorius!</L>
<L>These Eyes have seen the bravest Sons of Rome</L>
<L>Driven to their very Camp, like fearful Fawns,</L>
<L>By these oft beaten Equi, by the Foes</L>
<L>They once disdain'd, nor cou'd my Soul condemn them:</L>

<L>AS late, to shun the Noonday's scorching Heat,</L>
<L>I sought in yonder Grove a cool Retreat;</L>

Fair Doris sat; and in a dying Strain,</L>

<L>Here, while he sung, the Winds forgot to blow,</L>
<L>The Leaves to tremble, and the Streams to flow;</L>
<L>All Nature fix'd in silent Wonder stood,</L>
<L>And not a breathing Breeze disturb'd the Wood.</L>

<L>This Elm is Witness of my constant Flame,</L>

<L>Beneath the Shelter of it's spreading Boughs</L>

<L>The soft Infection seiz'd my pitying Breast.</L>

<L>Though thoughtless of thy heav'nly Voice,</L>
<L>I first the plaintive Strain essay'd;</L>

<L>O, beauteous Liberty! for thee</L>
<L>The Rhine's unhappy Exiles roam,</L>
<L>Forc'd by a Tyrant's hard Decree,</L>
<L>To quit their dear paternal Home:</L>
<L>By thee Helvetia's barren Mountains smile,</L>

<L>Victorious Essex, Drake, and Raleigh, shone.</L>

<L>Of Empire, mighty Burghley rise!</L>
