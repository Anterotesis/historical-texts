<HEAD>PREFACE</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY <HI>Margelina Scribelinda Macularia.</HI></BYLINE>
<P>AS there are so many Impostors and Imitators Abroad, it is highly requisite the Public should be satisfied, that this is the true and genuine <HI>Dunciad</HI> of Mrs. <HI>Mary Midnight;</HI> to which End I have wrote this short Preface. The Reader, there∣fore, is desir'd to attend to me with a little Patience, before he en∣ters upon this great and wonderful Work. The extensive Fame our Author has gain'd, by her <HI>learned Lucubrations,</HI> in all the <HI>Courts</HI> and <HI>Universities</HI> in <HI>Europe,</HI> has excited many (who have, by some Means or other, met with some of her Fragments) to vend among them their Heaps of Trash in her Name; but it is hop'd the World will do her the Justice, to think she is not the Author of such poor paul∣try, wishy, washy, shim-sham Performances.</P>
<P>To reward, among many others, the Authors of such Proceed∣ings in a Manner due to their Deserts, Mrs. <HI>Midnight</HI> has design'd and executed this Work; but, as an Affair of so much Consequence could not but get Air in the World, several of these, who were cons∣cious of their Guilt, applied to her to <HI>be excus'd a Place;</HI> or, in other Words, <HI>to be left out</HI> of her <HI>Dunciad:</HI> Among which came the celebrated <HI>Pentweazle,</HI> and meanly offer'd her <HI>five Guineas</HI> in part, on Subscription to her Miscellany of Poems, to be publish'd some Time in <HI>February</HI> next. But Mrs. <HI>Midnight</HI> being above any mercenary View, was deaf to all Overtures, however considerable, of this kind: Upon which, with their usual Assurance, her Enemies ad∣vertis'd even this intended Work, <HI>the Old Woman's Dunciad,</HI> in her's and in my Name, intending to impose some Trumpery or other on the World, before this Poem could appear; and, with the most consummate Impudence, put out Advertisements against the fictitious
<PB REF="3"/>
Imitators of Mrs. <HI>Midnight's</HI> Works, to out-face, if possible, the very Truth itself. But we have, thro' a surprising Quickness of Ge∣nius, peculiar to our Author, anticipated their Designs, to their utter Confusion: Since the World will, by reading the following Work, be convinc'd of the genuine and elevated Spirit of Mrs. <HI>Midnight,</HI> and will not, for the future, be so easily impos'd on. I shall just add a Word or two on our Author's Character in general, and on this Work in particular. As to Mrs. <HI>Midnight's</HI> Reputation as an Au∣thor, notwithstanding she has made herself known but lately under that Name, yet it has been very extensive, under the more general one of <HI>Old Woman;</HI> she having had the principal Hand in most of the Performances that have been wrote within these few Years past; all which have been infallibly known by the Critics, who upon Peru∣sal of them, have immediately laid them down, and crying out, <HI>the Author's</HI> an <HI>Old Woman;</HI> intimating thereby their Knowledge of her Works, and her establish'd Reputation that rais'd them above Criti∣cism. As to this Poem in particular, the Publick can never enough acknowledge the Obligations they owe her, in these Improvements of our Language; which, however, fall vastly short of what she pur∣poses to do, having selected several thousands of the most curious and copious in the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Eulogium on the <HI>Welch</HI> Tongue. <HI>Cambria</HI> Book II. Line 20.</NOTE> <HI>Gemerian</HI> or <HI>Welch</HI> Tongue, which will far exceed any Embellishment whatsoever drawn from the <HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>Latin.</HI></P>

<P>Line 7. <HI>Of Nose obesete-snotty Noses</HI> This Epithet, which, as a compound one, is not a little to be commended, is yet more admi∣rable, as it has its Derivation from the <HI>Latin;</HI> in which Language a judicious and witty Man is signified by a Man with his <HI>Nose wip'd;</HI> and a Blockhead by a Fellow with a nasty or <HI>fat Nose,</HI> according to our vulgar Phrase a <HI>snotty</HI> one. <HI>Martina Scribelinda Ma∣cularia.</HI></P>
<P>Line 11. <HI>Cull more Flowers—nor Rosemary cull</HI>] The Text is here extremely well ex∣press'd in the Interpretation, as the so often repeated Thought of the Muses gathering Flowers upon the Banks of the River <HI>Avon,</HI> for <HI>Shakespear,</HI> can certainly mean no more than the old fashioned Custom of gathering Rosemary for the Dead.—The Reader may find the above Thought in the <HI>Pleasures of Imagination,</HI> also in a late Piece called the <HI>Rosciad</HI> and many others; whose Merit is a sufficient Reason, I suppose, for its being in∣serted here.</P></NOTE></L>

<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>Line 37. <HI>Th' illucid Lopse,</HI> &amp;c.] The Reader may observe how our Author has imitated the great Men of our own Day in five or six of the preceding Lines; in which she has not an <HI>elegant</HI> Word but belongs to some of them. Nay, she has even almost copied whole Lines from them, in particular, from <HI>Cambria;</HI> and the beautiful Expression of the <HI>lucid Lapse,</HI> from the <HI>Excursion</HI> of Mr. <HI>Mallet</HI>—I am somewhat surprized, however, that Mrs. <HI>Midnight</HI> could condescend to imi∣tate, in so unpoetical a Line as
<Q>There is a Cave fast by this House of Pray'r,</Q>
a Writer of so little Credit in Point of Lan∣guage as <HI>Milton;</HI> since it might have been modernized beautifully thus;

it is therefore excuseable if in a Poem, like this, so <HI>crammed</HI> with Beauties, there should he found <HI>one</HI> Fault.</P>
<P>Line 39. <HI>The torpid Wretch</HI>] The Reader, to taste the Beauty of this Picture, and come to a right Understanding of our Author, must turn to the Frontispiece of the <HI>Old Wo∣man's Magazine,</HI>(a Work of which Notice has been taken in our Preface) where he will find the Pictures of <HI>Dullness</HI> and <HI>Poverty</HI> re∣presented under the Characters of Mrs. <HI>Mary Midnight</HI> and her Consederate <HI>Succubus Ca∣nidia</HI>—See Front to <HI>Old Wom.

<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>Line 40. <HI>By that Name,</HI> &amp;c.] It is a Mat∣ter of no little Dispute whether the Consede∣rate of <HI>Dullness</HI> should be called <HI>Succubus Ca∣nidia</HI> —the <HI>Christian</HI> Name, signifying a De∣vil in the Shape of an old Woman, and the Surname being taken from that of a <HI>Neapoli∣tan Jezebel,</HI> whom <HI>Horace</HI> calls a Witch— the Query is (since we know the Figure re∣presented is <HI>Poverty</HI>) whether <HI>Poverty</HI> can be justly called a Witch? Some have as∣serted, yes; because Witches are always poor, and old. But this is consuted by the learned and judicious Author of the <HI>Spectator,</HI> who says, that tho' Poverty and Age make Wo∣men <HI>suspected</HI> of being Witches, it is, never∣theless, no <HI>Proof</HI> of their, being so. And as to <HI>Shakespear's</HI> representing his Witches in this Manner, every Body knows his poetical Genius, never consined himself to historical Truth. It is, in fine, so abstruse and intri∣cate a Point, that tho' I have consulted <HI>Glan∣ville, Moreton</HI> and others, I must leave it to the Decision of abler Critics.</P>
<P>Line 42. <HI>In culmiferous,</HI> &amp;c] The Pro∣priety of these Epithets are admirable, and particularly consonant to <HI>Horace's</HI> Rule— they seem to be borrow'd from <HI>Cambria,</HI> and are not a little a-kin to the Author of this Line

<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>Line 48. <HI>In her better Hand.</HI>] Doubtless many People will wonder why the <HI>Left</HI> Hand should be here expressed by the <HI>better,</HI> and will dispute why one Hand is better than the other, but Mrs. <HI>Midnight</HI> has not wrote this without a Precedent, the Reader will find this same Epithet in the <HI>Rosciad,</HI> Ver. 69, to specify the Right Hand, which she has here given to the Left; admirably intimating that <HI>Dullness</HI> is Left-handed; or in other Terms, unlucky. <HI>Martina Scribelinda Ma∣cularia.</HI></P>
<P>Line 51. <HI>Daily Lucubrations!</HI>] The Rea∣der will do well to consider, that as <HI>Dullness</HI> lives in a Cellar, it is no Wonder she burns Candle in the Day-Time-beside the Text says they are Thoughts her Owl inspires: And who knows but her Owl may be in as bad a Situation as Mr. <HI>Smart,</HI> who wanted Light to see that it was dark, as a late Epi∣gram intimates.—See <HI>Kapelion,</HI> No. 4. It is however, certain that all Authors have not the clearest Ideas of Day and Night—You will find in the <HI>Rosciad</HI> that at <HI>Night</HI> <Q><L>—The <HI>lunar</HI> Queen</L>
<L>Shines forth with Splendor round the dimmer <HI>Day.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>Line 51. —<HI>Thoughts prelaute</HI>] Doubt∣less the Critics, of a fine Ear for the Flow of Verse, will be as much offended at the disagreeable Sound (I might have said Ca∣cophony) of these two open Words com∣ing together, as were the fine tympanum'd Gentry, in the Court of <HI>Angustus,</HI> against a certain Line in <HI>Virgil</HI> (which as I don't re∣member I must pass over) but Mrs. <HI>Midnight</HI> has in this shewn her Respect for the Moder∣nizes of Poetry—I will give you an In∣stance—A certain Writer, who stands much on his Merit in this Point, has used often these two Words together, <HI>natal Land.</HI> Now there is a surprising Harshness in the two Els, and almost an Impossibility of pro∣nouncing them both, without making a Stop between the Words—It is true, Mr. <HI>Rowe,</HI> with wonderful Sweetness, has used the Word <HI>native here</HI>
<Q>More than myself I prize my native Land.</Q></P>
<P>Here now is a softening Syllable to har∣monize the Strength of the preceding and following ones—but what of this? <HI>Native</HI> is a vulgar Word, and every Consideration should be given up for an Epithet obsolete or uncommon, as the abovementioned Refiner of plain <HI>English</HI> has shewn us, such as,
<Q>Patriotic <HI>Worth—Treaty of</HI> Pacification,</Q>
and numberless others—it must be owned—<HI>Patriot worth—Treaty of Peace,</HI> would be equally expressive, and a thousand Times more elegant and beautiful; but, as that would be a common Way of Speech, the Dignity of the Language would have been degraded.</P></NOTE></L>

<L>When Seaman's Plague drives on the Fleet,</L>
<L>Or when at Night, by Magic wrought,</L>
<L>Of three times three by <HI>Hecate</HI> taught,</L>
<L>Witches on Wisps of Straw their Bums stick,</L>
<L>Or ride like Devils astride a Broom-stick.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="7"/>G-d bless the Muse—I thank her now</L>
<L>I mount and Dullness' Cellar view.</L>
<L>Look where the Church of great St. <HI>Paul</HI></L>
<L>Rears up its losty Head so tall,</L>
<L>Above the Parish Churches all.</L>
<L>So <HI>notified</HI> Welch Mountains high,</L>
<L>Rear up their Heads above the Sky.</L>
<L><HI>Alps, Alps,</HI> and <HI>Pelion Ossa</HI> pile,</L>
<L>The Lord knows how many hundred Mile;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="8"/>But by the nearest; Guess that's giv'n</L>
<L>Within Hop, Step, and Jump of Heav'n;</L>
<L>Stand, lost in Clouds and Fogs and Rime,</L>
<L>As antient as the Pen of Time.</L>
<L>Now by this Church there is a Cellar,</L>
<L>Where Goddess <HI>Dullness</HI> is the Dweller;</L>
<L>So very <HI>low,</HI> that it may well</L>
<L>Deserve the Title of a Cell.</L>
<L>Its Groundfil a Stone's Throw or more,</L>
<L>From where the rushing <HI>common Shore</HI></L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="9"/>Runs bubbling down the muddy Place,</L>
<L>Roaring with Dirt and Nastiness,</L>
<L>Within this Cellar, scarce discern'd</L>
<L>By Cinders into Embers burn'd,</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="10"/>There hov'ring sits the <HI>Humdrum</HI> Wretch</L>
<L>With <HI>Canid;</HI> call'd (if right) a Witch:</L>
<L>As in Corn Fields, or leasy Woods,</L>
<L>With all their Chattles and their Goods,</L>
<L>The wandering Gypsies sit them down,</L>
<L>And smoke their Dinner Pipe at Noon,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="11"/>So they the dear Tobacco <HI>Quid,</HI></L>
<L>Or suck short Pipe, as <HI>Shipton</HI> did,</L>
<L>While in the Goddess better Hand,</L>
<L>A 'bacco Box is at Command;</L>
<L>And the waste Book of common Place,</L>
<L>And written Sheets her left doth grace,</L>
<L>Her daily Works of Candle Light,</L>
<L>Works which her screech Owl doth indite:</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="12"/>For he, Companion of their Studies,</L>
<L>Was us'd to hoot, to please the Goddess:</L>
<L>In a brown Study always gone,</L>
<L>Oh ever worthy <HI>Dullness</HI> Son!</L>
<L>O you, whoe'er delight to dwell</L>
<L>Within the Threshold of her Cell;</L>
<L>Of you, the Muse her Song shall tell:</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="13"/>Yet in Remembrance beas the Lay,</L>
<L>And as the Time may serve repay.</L>
<L>Within the Cell where <HI>Dullness</HI> Lives,</L>
<L>Constant each Son attendance gives;</L>
<L>Let her but nod or wink her Eyes,</L>
<L><HI>Whip, Presto,</HI> in a Trice, he flies.</L>
<L>Here, chief, her Owl, sedate and Sage,</L>
<L><HI>Stands hanging,</HI> in his mounted Cage:</L>
<L>While Thoughts succeed, in nodding Fits,</L>
<L>As musing in the Dumps he sits,</L>
<L>And Hunger jogs and wakes his Wits.</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="14"/>Unlucky those whom <HI>Dullness</HI> curses!</L>
<L>Her charms more fatal are than <HI>Circe</HI>'s,</L>
<L>That made, of old, such horrid Work,</L>
<L>And turn'd <HI>Greek</HI> Sailors into Pork!</L>
<L>Say Muse, how, 'cause it hap'd to please her,</L>
<L>From human Form poor <HI>Ebenezer</HI></L>
<L>(For some vile End which she had purpos'd)</L>
<L>Into an Owl was metamorphos'd.</L>
<L>As once was serv'd the tatling son,</L>
<L>Ascalaphus, <HI>of</HI> Acheron.</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="15"/>Late witty, <HI>Smart,</HI> he laugh'd and sung;</L>
<L>E'er curst <HI>Conidia</HI> on him hung,</L>
<L>Who, meagre, in his Pocket crept</L>
<L>And there in form of nothing slept;</L>
<L>Whence ev'ry golden Cross she banish'd,</L>
<L>And ev'n the Sound of Chinking vanish'd.</L>
<L>Then <HI>Dullness</HI> shew'd, in Hour accurs'd,</L>
<L>Within her leaden Hand a Crust;</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="16"/>More pow'rful o'er the hungry Stomach</L>
<L>Than nightly Charm the Witches do make?</L>
<L>Then eastern Tal'sman or strange Scrawls</L>
<L>On the learn'd Fortune-teller's Walls!</L>
<L>He took and eat—Lord bless my Eyes!</L>
<L>And fell her slavish Sacrifice.</L>
<L>And now, whene'er he wants a Supper,</L>
<L>She waves her pow'rful 'Bacco-stopper,</L>
<L>And he, aloft; a screech Owl, screams!</L>
<L>Or gets into his tantrum Dreams;</L>
<L>Fancies himself an Eagle there,</L>
<L>And raises Castles in the Air;</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="17"/>Or else, into a <HI>Weazel Pent,</HI></L>
<L>He serves the Goddess's intent.</L>
<L>Or else, in an old Woman seen,</L>
<L>Sweeps Rubbish for a <HI>Magazine.</HI></L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="18"/>Cracks Nuts that have been crack'd before,</L>
<L>Or, toothless, mumbles Grace twice o'er.</L>
<L>Next him, who next in Point of Knowledge is,</L>
<L>Brought up in one of <HI>Oxon</HI>'s Colleges,</L>
<L>For whom, on <HI>Isis</HI>' Banks the Strumpet</L>
<L><HI>Fame</HI> founded <HI>Student</HI> thro' her Trumpet,</L>
<L>Now turn'd into a <HI>Jack-daw</HI> chatters.</L>
<L>Or in the <HI>Jakes of Genius</HI> spatters;</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="19"/>Or, drest in Female Petticoat,</L>
<L>Helps Fame to sound a louder Note;</L>
<L>While the wise screech Owl, in <HI>Chimaera,</HI></L>
<L>Builds mighty Castles; bought too dear, Ah!</L>
<L>For here no Ground-Rent is requir'd,</L>
<L>Nor Carvers Work to be admir'd,</L>
<L>Nor Glow the Brick-kilns piping hot,</L>
<L>To bake the Clay trod under foot:</L>
<L>And yet by this his Dinner's got.</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="20"/>Next Dullness' third and fav'rite Son,</L>
<L><HI>Frigidio,</HI> bids the Verse go on.</L>
<L><HI>Frigidio</HI> fam'd, whose great Renown</L>
<L>Fame loudly, farts about the Town.</L>
<L>See, down i' th' Mouth, with Brow contracted,</L>
<L>With Head-ach and the Hip-distracted,</L>
<L>He sits i' th' Dumps; so ruminating</L>
<L>As thoughtless Cows do when they're eating.</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="21"/>For ah! and oh! in filthy Breeches,</L>
<L>An Egg; fresh laid, his Bum bewitches.</L>
<L>For what, O heav'nly Muse! pray tell,</L>
<L>This shitten Curse her Child befell.</L>
<L>So luck would have't, in evil Hour,</L>
<L><HI>Smack'em,</HI> a wicked Son of a Whore,</L>
<L>Enter'd the darksome Cave, and told 'em,</L>
<L>He'd make the House too hot to hold 'em.</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="22"/>Roar'd, curst and swore, and play'd the Devil,</L>
<L>Still threatn'ing some approaching Evil.</L>
<L>Just then <HI>Frigidio</HI>'s Blood ran cold,</L>
<L>And down his Guts loud Grumbles roll'd,</L>
<L>That some descending Evil spoke,</L>
<L>Which now (but who can help ill Luck!)</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="23"/>He runs t'avoid. But ah! undone!</L>
<L>He finds the Close-stool Refuge gone.</L>
<L>Amid the Fire behold it blazing,</L>
<L>To Cinders burnt. Ah! most amazing!</L>
<L>Now all his Fears behind burst out,</L>
<L>And he besmear'd, stinks all about:</L>
<L>As when <HI>Tom Turdman,</HI> on his Cart,</L>
<L>Poisons the Night with filthy Art;</L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="24"/>At first we find the spicy Scent</L>
<L>Perfumes the Nostrils violent;</L>
<L>Till the Air cleansing by Degrees,</L>
<L>The gently dying Stink decays.</L>
<L>Thou Type of <HI>Curl!</HI> O fam'd <HI>Carnan!</HI></L>
<L>Be thou the Safeguard of the Pan,</L>
<L>If any future Force attempt it;</L>
<L>And when 'tis full, take care to empt it,</L>
<L>Or dip thy Fingers in the Flood,</L>
<L>And paint and gild with native Mud.</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="25"/>Until thy rubrick Post, so fine,</L>
<L>Shall like a shitten Barn-door shine.</L>
<L>But hark! what Noise is this I hear?</L>
<L>What else remains that's Worth my Care?</L>
<L><PB N="25" REF="26"/>A Crowd of Scribblers yon, in Limbo,</L>
<L>Like Oyster Nymphs, with Arms a-kimbo,</L>
<L>Lunge with sharp-pointed Pens, as cruel</L>
<L>As pale-fac'd Beaux do in a Duel.</L>
<L>Those chiefly who of late, notorious</L>
<L>Knock'd under <HI>Smack'em</HI>'s Arm inglorious,</L>
<L><HI>Dunciadus, Entity,</HI> whose Name is</L>
<L>So universal, and so famous</L>
<L><PB N="26" REF="27"/>Thou <HI>Crocodile</HI> by Name and Nature,</L>
<L>The greatest, and thou <HI>Woodville</HI> greater.</L>
<L>But who the Duce! <HI>marry and Amen!</HI></L>
<L>Our Eastern venerable <HI>Bramin!</HI></L>
<L>Old Father grey Beard's whiten'd Locks</L>
<L>'Mong <HI>Students,</HI> Disputants, and Cooks.</L>
<L><PB N="27" REF="28"/>Muse shut the Scene▪ and drop the Curtain,</L>
<L>Or, even, I shall sleep for certain.</L>
<L>Now is that mighty Work compleat,</L>
<L>That should, on Brass, be 'graven neat</L>
<L>Or printed on the Royal Sheet:</L>
<L>Where lasting Worth shall be admir'd</L>
<L>Till Masters are with Flogging tir'd,</L>
<L>Then let no snarling Critic dream</L>
<L>A Trump'ry-Ballad is my Theme,</L>
<L><PB N="28" REF="29"/>Or call (because they think they're wife)</L>
<L>This <HI>Fustian;</HI> me, a <HI>Fustianizer;</HI></L>
<L>But if a Love for modern Verse</L>
<L>Deserve th' unluky Play'rs Curse;</L>
<L>Or to be laugh'd at be its Merit.</L>
<L>Laugh and be pox'd, for I can bear it.</L>
