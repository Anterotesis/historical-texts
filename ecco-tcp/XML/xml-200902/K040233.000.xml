<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Father of the following little Offspring, being very well convinc'd of the natural Weakness of this his puny Child, did never intend to trust it abroad without the <HI>LEADING STRINGS</HI> of <HI>Action;</HI> had not the Fear of those, who, like Cowards, are afraid of their own Shadows, assiduously oppos'd the Representation; being terribly apprehensive that the Strength of a poor Baby <HI>Monosyllable</HI> might affect the Mag∣nanimity of a <HI>Drawcansir.</HI>—Such is the Force of Self-Conviction!—But as this Infant is oblig'd to walk alone, by many who are resolv'd on it's Appearance, it's Father most humbly desires the good-natur'd Town will not tumble the little Creature into the Dirt; but that they will help it forward over the Kennels of Detraction; and, in Com∣passion to the Tenderness of it's Age, keep the barking Curs, the Critics, at a Distance.— And to excite them to this Benevolence, here
<PB N="ii" REF="4"/>
follow the Memoirs of the cruel and affecting Period of its Birth, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This Piece of <HI>Fun,</HI> Son to the Father, and Grandson to the Grandfather of the same Name, was conceiv'd, in a Fit of Laughter, about the 8th of <HI>February,</HI> in the Year 1752. —His Mother advanc'd happily in her Preg∣nancy, and there were great Hopes of a fine Offspring; but, unhappily, just before the Time of her Delivery, Measures were taken, by a certain great Man, to make her mis∣carry; excited, as some say, to this Piece of Barbarity, by an old Woman's Prophesy which he keeps by him (cast in <HI>leaden</HI> Characters) in a Chest of <HI>Brass</HI> secured, like the <HI>fortunate Tickets</HI> of a Lottery, by <HI>seven Locks:</HI> And of which Prophesy the following is a Tran∣script:</P>
<Q><L>When <HI>Fun</HI></L>
<L>Has a Son</L>
<L>Then <HI>Drawcansir</HI>'s Race is run.</L></Q>
<P>However childish and ridiculous it may seem for a Man to be affected with such idle Stuff as this, it is not unprecedented or extravagantly strange; since Tradition tells us, that <HI>Saturn,</HI> Father of <HI>JUPITER,</HI> the Great Grandfather of <HI>Cyrus,</HI> and many other august Personages, were equally mov'd, by such Instigations, to much the same Absurdities.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="5"/>Notwithstanding, however, all such malig∣nant Measures were taken, the full Time of Pregnancy advanc'd, and the Child was hourly expected; when a <HI>positive Order</HI> came down, that <HI>Mrs. FUN,</HI> who then lay at the <HI>Castle-Tavern, Pater-noster-Row,</HI> must not be brought to-bed within the Walls, lest the Child, which was suspected to be a Bastard, should bring a Scandal on the <HI>Dignity</HI> and <HI>Chastity</HI> of the City. Upon this, even while the Lady lay crying out, the Father waited on the chief Personage of the <HI>Liberties,</HI> with Remonstran∣ces, that the Child was very honestly got, and that none but very creditable People were at the Labour; complaining, at the same Time, that the same Privilege had been permitted an <HI>old Woman</HI> of <HI>a very bad Character,</HI> one <HI>Mother Midnight,</HI> who had often practis'd her Profession there, tho' it was now denied others. —'Twas all in vain: The Gentleman, though he behav'd with a great deal of Politeness and Good-manners, was so prepossess'd against the whole Family of <HI>FUN,</HI> which had been falsely represented to him as of no Character or Reputation, that he not only forbid the Men Midwives doing their Duty, but sent others to see his Orders duly executed.—What could now be done?—<HI>Mrs. FUN</HI> was, in the midst of her Travail, remov'd; and, no∣body daring to give her Assistance, her poor Offspring almost perished in the Birth. But
<PB N="iv" REF="6"/>
Nature had been liberal, the <HI>Stamina</HI> were sound, and branched out for Life. 'Tis true, indeed, its Features were so defac'd, that the strong <HI>Likeness</HI> in them was almost lost; and a Weakness, which will be lasting as it's Life, is the Consequence of the Usage it then met with.—If, after all, then, it should fail of answering those Expectations the Town had of it, in Embrio; it will undoubtedly be thought, there is Reason enough to excuse all the Imperfections and Failings it is unhappily afflicted with; since these are so far from being its Faults, that they are Misfortunes which must infallibly engage the Protection of every candid, tender-hearted, <HI>christian</HI> Reader!</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<L>AS dying Sinners hope to get to Heav'n,</L>
<L>And beg and pray to have their Crimes forgiv'n,</L>
<L>So I come here, with humble Supplication,</L>
<L>In Hopes you'll kindly save us from <HI>Damnation.</HI></L>
<L>For you must know the whole of this <HI>Design,</HI></L>
<L>The Plot, the Manner, Sentiment is mine.</L>
<L>'Tis true, we must confess, our motley Piece</L>
<L>Is not confin'd by Laws from <HI>Rome</HI> or <HI>Greece:</HI></L>
<L>For I disdain old <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s Rules,</L>
<L>That tie down Scriblers, limit none but <HI>Fools.</HI></L>
<L>I dare beyond the Goal of Critics run,</L>
<L>What Order should confine the Works of <HI>FUN,</HI></L>
<L>Whose <HI>Self</HI> I am?—And for your Information,</L>
<L>Hear my Birth, Parentage and Education:</L>
<L>My Sire was, thirty Years ago, in Vogue;</L>
<L>His Name was <HI>WIT,</HI> an arch, diverting Rogue;</L>
<L>My Mother's Name was <HI>HUMOUR,</HI> low and poor,</L>
<L>Reduc'd for Want sometimes to play the Whore.</L>
<L>Who best repaid what she was pleas'd to grant,</L>
<L>Was <HI>RIBALDRY,</HI> her favourite Gallant.</L>
<L>Now, little Delicacy dwelt in either,</L>
<L>For, as I'm told, they <HI>all Three</HI> lay together.</L>
<L>Soon after I was born, their darling Son,</L>
<L>A Bastard Compound he!—was christen'd <HI>FUN.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Laughter,</HI> a merry Jade, was chose my Nurse;</L>
<L>Whose <HI>Birth</HI> was mean, but Education worse;</L>
<L>Betimes she taught me to distort the Face,</L>
<L>And sneer at ev'ry Thing but want of Grace;</L>
<L>At twelve Years old she sent me first to School;</L>
<L>My Tutor, <HI>Ignorance,</HI> a Coxcomb and a Fool.</L>
<L>Little I learn'd 'tis true, but ev'ry Day</L>
<L>The Truant play'd, at length ran quite away.</L>
<L>Proud of my Freedom, rambling up and down,</L>
<L><HI>Folly,</HI> a Jilt that ruins half the Town,</L>
<L>Spreading those Arms which ev'ry Fool admires,</L>
<L>Caught me to satisfy her loose Desires.</L>
<L>The Task, tho' hard, I follow'd with Delight;</L>
<L>Sometimes most wisely wrong, and sometimes blindly right;</L>
<L>Above all Order, or the vain Pretence</L>
<L>Of Learning, Genius, Taste or Common Sense.</L>
<L>Who then will censure what may here be done?</L>
<L>What <HI>WIT</HI> will criticise a <HI>PIECE OF FUN?</HI></L>
