<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Woodley <HI>and</HI> Dimity.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dimity.</SPEAKER>
<P>PO! Po!—no such thing—I tell you, Mr. Woodley, you are a mere novice in these affairs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wood.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but listen to reason, Mrs. Dimity,— has not your master, Mr. Drugget, invited me down to his country-seat, in order to give me his daughter Nancy in marriage; and with what pretence can he now break off?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>What pretence!—you put a body out of all patience—But go on your own way, Sir; my advice is all lost upon you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wood.</SPEAKER>
<P>You do me injustice, Mrs. Dimity—your advice has governed my whole conduct—Have not I sixed an interest in the young lady's heart?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>An interest in a fiddlestick!—you ought to have made love to the father and mother—what, do you think the way to get a wife, at this time of day, is by speaking sine things to the lady you have a fancy for? —That was the practice, indeed; but things are alter'd now—you must address the old people, Sir; and never trouble your head about your mistress—None of your
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>letters, and verses, and soft looks, and fine speeches, — <Q>Have compassion, thou angelic creature, on a poor dying</Q>—Pshaw! stuff! nonsense! all out of fashion, —Go your ways to the old curmudgeon, humour his whims— <Q>I shall esteem it an honour, Sir, to be allied to a gentleman of your rank and taste.</Q> <Q>Upon my word, he's a pretty young gentleman.</Q>—Then wheel about to the mother: <Q>Your daughter, Ma'am, is the very model of you, and I shall adore her for your sake.</Q> <Q>Here, come hither, Nancy, take this gentleman for better for worse.</Q> <Q>La, mama, I can never consent.</Q>— <Q>I should not have thought of your consent—the consent of your relations is enough: why, how now, hussey!</Q> So away you go to church, the knot is tied, an agree∣able honey-moon follows, the charm is then dissolv'd; you go to all the clubs in St. James's Street; your lady goes to the Coterie; and, in a little time you both go to Doctor's Commons; and, if faults on both sides prevent a divorce, you'll quarrel like contrary elements all the rest of your lives: that's the way of the world now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wood.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you know, my dear Dimity, the old couple have received every mark of attention from me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Attention! to be sure you did not fall asleep in their company; but what then?—You should have entered into their characters, play'd with their hu∣mours, and sacrificed to their absurdities.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wood.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if my temper is too frank—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Frank, indeed! yes, you have been frank enough to ruin yourself.—Have not you to do with a rich old shop-keeper, retired from business with an hundred thousand pounds in his pocket, to enjoy the dust of the London road, which he calls living in the country—and yet you must find fault with his situation! —What if he has made a ridiculous gimcrack of his house and gardens, you know his heart is set upon it; and could not you have commended his taste? But you must be too frank!— <Q>Those walks and alleys are too regular—those evergreens should not be cut
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>into such fantastic shapes.</Q>—And thus you advise a poor old mechanic, who delights in every thing that's monstrous, to follow nature—Oh, you're likely to be a successful lover!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wood.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why should I not save a father-in-law from being a laughing-stock?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Make him your father-in-law first—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wood.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, he can't open his windows for the dust —he stands all day looking through a pane of glass at the carts and stage-coaches as they pass by, and he calls that living in the fresh air, and enjoying his own thoughts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>And could not you let him go on his own way? You have ruin'd yourself by talking sense to him; and all your nonsense to the daughter won't make amends for it.—And then the mother; how have you play'd your cards in that quarter?—She wants a tinsel man of fashion for her second daughter—"Don't you see (says she) how happy my eldest girl is made by marrying Sir Charles Rackett. She has been married three entire weeks, and not so much as one angry word has pass'd between them—Nancy shall have a man of quality too."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wood.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet I know Sir Charles Rackett per∣fectly well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, so do I; and I know he'll make his lady wretched at last—But what then? You should have humour'd the old folks,—you should have been a talking empty fop, to the good old lady, and to the old gentleman, an admirer of his taste in gardening. But you have lost him—he is grown fond of this beau Lovelace, who is here in the house with him; the coxcomb ingratiates himself by flattery, and you're undone by frankness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wood.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, Dimity, I won't despair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet you have reason to despair; a million of reasons—To-morrow is fix'd for the wedding-day; Sir Charles and his lady are to be here this very night— they are engag'd, indeed, at a great rout in town, but they take a bed here, notwithstanding.—The family is sitting up for them; Mr. Drugget will keep you
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>all up in the next room there, till they arrive—and to-morrow the business is over—and yet you don't despair!—hush!—hold your tongue; here comes Lovelace.—Step in, and I'll devise something, I warrant you. <STAGE>(<HI>Exit</HI> Woodley)</STAGE> The old folks shall not have their own way—'tis enough to vex a body, to see an old father and mother marrying their daugh∣ter as they please, in spite of all I can do.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Drugget <HI>and</HI> Lovelace.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so you like my house and gardens, Mr. Lovelace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Love.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! perfectly, Sir; they gratify my taste of all things. One sees villas where nature reigns in a wild kind of simplicity; but then they have no ap∣pearance of art, no art at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, rightly distinguish'd:—now mine is all art; no wild nature here; I did it all myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Love.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, had you none of the great proficients in gardening to assist you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lackaday! no, —ha! ha! I understand these things—I love my garden. The front of my house, Mr. Lovelace, is not that very pretty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Love.</SPEAKER>
<P>Elegant to a degree!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't you like the sun-dial, plac'd just by my dining-room windows?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Love.</SPEAKER>
<P>A perfect beauty!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>I knew you'd like it—and the motto is so well adapted—<HI>Tempus edax &amp; index rerum.</HI> And I know the meaning of it—Time eateth and discovereth all things—ha! ha! pretty, Mr. Lovelace!—I have seen people so stare at it as they pass by—ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Love.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why now, I don't believe there's a nobleman in the kingdom has such a thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh no—they have got into a false taste. I bought that bit of ground, the other side of the road— and it looks very pretty—I made a duck-pond there, for the sake of the prospect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Love.</SPEAKER>
<P>Charmingly imagin'd!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>My leaden images are well—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
<SPEAKER>Love.</SPEAKER>
<P>They exceed ancient statuary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>I love to be surpriz'd at the turning of a walk with an inanimate figure, that looks you full in the face, and can say nothing to you, while one is enjoying one's own thoughts—ha! ha!—Mr. Love∣lace, I'll point out a beauty to you—Just by the haw-haw, at the end of my ground, there is a fine Dutch figure, with a scythe in his hand, and a pipe in his mouth—that's a jewel, Mr. Lovelace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Love.</SPEAKER>
<P>That escap'd me: a thousand thanks for point∣ing it out—I observe you have two very fine yew∣trees before the house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lackaday, Sir! they look uncouth—I have a design about them—I intend—ha! ha! it will be very pretty, Mr. Lovelace—I intend to have them cut into the shape of the two giants at Guildhall— ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Love.</SPEAKER>
<P>Exquisite!—why then they won't look like trees.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, no, no—not at all—I won't have any thing in my garden that looks like what it is— ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Love.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nobody understands these things like you, Mr. Drugget.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lackaday! its all my delight now—this is what I have been working for. I have a great improve∣ment to make still—I propose to have my evergreens cut into fortifications; and then I shall have the Moro castle, and the Havanna; and then near it shall be ships of myrtle, sailing upon seas of box to attack the town: won't that make my place look very rural, Mr. Lovelace?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Love.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you have the most fertile invention, Mr. Drugget.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! this is what I have been working for. I love my garden—but I must beg your pardon for a few moments—I must step and speak with a fa∣mous nursery-man, who is come to offer me some choice things.—Do go and join the company, Mr. Lovelace—my daughter Rackett and Sir Charles will
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>be here presently—I shan't go to bed till I see 'em— ha! ha! my place is prettily variegated—this is what I have been working for—I fin'd for Sheriff to enjoy these things—ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Love.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor Mr. Drugget! Mynheer Van Thunder∣tentrunck, in his little box at the side of a dyke, has as much taste and elegance.—However, if I can but carry off his daughter, if I can but rob his garden of that flower—why then I shall say, "This is what I have been working for."</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Dimity.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do lend us your assistance, Mr. Lovelace— you're a sweet gentleman, and love a good natur'd action.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Love.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why how now! what's the matter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>My master is going to cut the two yew-trees into the shape of two devils, I believe; and my poor mistress is breaking her heart for it.—Do, run and advise him against it—she is your friend, you know she is, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Love.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, if that's all—I'll make that matter easy directly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>My mistress will be for ever oblig'd to you; and you'll marry her daughter in the morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Love.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, my rhetoric shall dissuade him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, Sir, put him against dealing with that nursery-man; Mrs. Drugget hates him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Love.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does she?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mortally.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Love.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say no more, the business is done.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>If he says one word, old Drugget will never forgive him.—My brain was at its last shift; but if this plot takes—So, here comes our Nancy.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Nancy.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Dimity, what's to become of me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>My stars! what makes you up, Miss?—I thought you were gone to bed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>Nan.</SPEAKER>
<P>What should I go to bed for? Only to tumble and toss, and fret, and be uneasy—they are going to marry me, and I am frighted out of my wits.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, you're the only young lady within fifty miles round, that would be frighten'd at such a thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! if they would let me chuse for myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't you like Mr. Lovelace?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nan.</SPEAKER>
<P>My mama does, but I don't; I don't mind his being a man of fashion, not I.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, pray, can you do better than follow the fashion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! I know there's a fashion for new bonnets, and a fashion for dressing the hair—but I never heard of a fashion for the heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, my dear, the heart mostly follows the fashion now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does it!—pray who sets the fashion of the heart?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>All the fine ladies in London, o'my con∣science.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nan.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what's the last new fashion, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, to marry any fop that has a few deceit∣ful agreeable appearances about him; something of a pert phrase, a good operator for the teeth, and tolerable taylor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nan.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do they marry without loving?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! marrying for love has been a great while out of fashion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, then I'll wait till that fashion comes up again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>And then, Mr. Lovelace, I reckon—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pshaw! I don't like him: he talks to me as if he was the most miserable man in the world, and the confident thing looks so pleas'd with himself all the while.—I want to marry for love, and not for card-playing—I should not be able to bear the life my sister leads with Sir Charles Rackett—and I'll forfeit my new cap, if they don't quarrel soon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh fie! no! they won't quarrel yet a-while. —A quarrel in three weeks after marriage, would be somewhat of the quickest—By and by we shall hear of their whims and their humours—Well, but if you don't like Mr. Lovelace, what say you to Mr. Woodley?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah!—I don't know what to say—but I can sing something that will explain my mind.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>SONG.
<LG>
<L>WHEN first the dear youth passing by,</L>
<L>Disclos'd his fair form to my sight,</L>
<L>I gaz'd, but I could not tell why;</L>
<L>My heart it went throb with delight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As nearer he drew, those sweet eyes</L>
<L>Were with their dear meaning so bright,</L>
<L>I trembled, and lost in surprize,</L>
<L>My heart it went throb with delight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When his lips their dear accents did try</L>
<L>The return of my love to excite,</L>
<L>I feign'd, yet began to guess why</L>
<L>My heart it went throb with delight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>We chang'd the stol'n glance, the fond smile,</L>
<L>Which lovers alone read aright;</L>
<L>We look'd, and we sigh'd, yet the while</L>
<L>Our hearts they went throb with delight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Consent I soon blush'd, with a sigh,</L>
<L>My promise I ventur'd to plight;</L>
<L>Come, Hymen, we then shall know why</L>
<L>Our hearts they go throb with delight.</L>
</LG></STAGE>

<P>My sweetest angel! I have heard all, and my heart overflows with love and gratitude.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! but I did not know you was listening. You should not have betray'd me so, Dimity: I shall be angry with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="11" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I'll take my chance for that.—Run both into my room, and say all your pretty things to one another there, for here comes the old gentleman—make haste away.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Exeunt</HI> Woodley <HI>and</HI> Nancy.</STAGE>

<SPEAKER>Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>A forward presuming coxcomb!—Dimity, do you step to Mrs. Drugget, and send her hither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir;—It works upon him, I see.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>The yew-trees ought not to be cut, because they'll help to keep off the dust, and I am too near the road already—a sorry ignorant fop!—When I am in so fine a situation, and can see every carriage that goes by.—And then to abuse the nursery-man's rarities;—A finer sucking pig in lavender, with sage growing in his belly, was never seen!—And yet he wants me not to have it—But have it I will.— There's a fine tree of Knowledge, too, with Adam and Eve in juniper; Eve's nose not quite grown, but it's thought in the spring will be very forward— I'll have that too—with the serpent in ground ivy— two poets in wormwood—I'll have them both. Ay; and there's a Lord Mayor's feast in honeysuckle; and the whole court of Aldermen in hornbeam: and three modern beaux in jessamine, somewhat stunted: they all shall be in my garden, with the Dragon of Wantley in box—all—all—I'll have 'em all, let my wife and Mr. Lovelace say what they will—</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter Mrs.</HI> Drugget.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you send for me, lovey?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>The yew-trees shall be cut into the giants of Guildhall, whether you will or not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sure my own dear will do as he pleases.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>And the pond, tho' you praise the green banks, shall be wall'd round, and I'll have a little fat boy in marble, spouting up water in the middle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. D.</SPEAKER>
<P>My sweet, who hinders you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and I'll buy the nursery-man's whole catalogue—Do you think, after retiring to live all the
<PB N="12" REF="12"/>way here, almost four miles from London, that I won't do as I please in my own garden.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. D.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear, but why are you in such a passion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll have the lavender pig, and the Adam and Eve, and the Dragon of Wantley, and all of 'em—and there shan't be a more romantic spot on the London road than mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm sure it's as pretty as hands can make it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did it all myself, and I'll do more—And Mr. Lovelace shan't have my daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. D.</SPEAKER>
<P>No! what's the matter now, Mr. Drug∣get?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>He shall learn better manners than to abuse my house and gardens.—You put him in the head of it, but I'll disappoint ye both—And so you may go and tell Mr. Lovelace that the match is quite off.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't comprehend all this, not I, —but I'll tell him so, if you please, my dear—I am willing to give myself pain, if it will give you pleasure: must I give myself pain?—Don't ask me, pray don't;—I don't like pain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am resolv'd, and it shall be so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let it be so then. <STAGE>(cries)</STAGE> Oh! oh! cruel man! I shall break my heart if the match is broke off —if it is not concluded to-morrow, send for an under∣taker, and bury me the next day.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>How! I don't want that neither—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! oh!—</P>

<P>I am your lord and master, my dear, but not your executioner—Before George, it must never be said that my wife died of too much compliance— Chear up, my love—and this affair shall be settled as soon as Sir Charles and Lady Rackett arrive.</P>

<P>Never tell me—it's too late now—Mr. Woodley, I recommend my girl to your care—I shall have nothing now to think of, but my greens, and my images, and my shrubbery—though, mercy on all married folks, say I! for these wranglings are, I am afraid, <HI>What we must all come to.</HI></P>

<L>WHAT we must all come to? <HI>What?—Come to what?</HI></L>
<L><HI>Must broils and quarrels be the marriage lot?</HI></L>
<L><HI>If that's the wise, deep meaning of our poet,</HI></L>
<L><HI>The man's a fool! a blockhead! and I'll shew it.</HI></L>

<L><HI>What could induce him in an age so nice,</HI></L>
<L><HI>So fam'd for virtue, so refin'd from vice,</HI></L>

<L><HI>As if a belle could quarrel with a beau:</HI></L>
<L><HI>As if there were—in these thrice happy days,</HI></L>
<L><HI>One who from nature, or from reason strays!</HI></L>

<L><HI>May learn one useful lesson from the stage.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Shun strife, ye fair, and once a contest o'er,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Wake to a blaze the dying flame no more—</HI></L>
<L><HI>From fierce debate, fly all the tender loves,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And Venus cries "Coachman put-to my doves."</HI></L>
<L><HI>The genial bed no blooming Grace prepares,</HI></L>
