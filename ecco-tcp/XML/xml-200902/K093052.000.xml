<P>I Suppose every Body is sufficiently appriz'd of, and duly prepar'd for the famous Conjunction to be celebrated the 29th of this Instant <HI>December,</HI> foretold by all the Sages of Antiquity, under the Name of the <HI>Annus Mirabilis,</HI> or the <HI>Metamorphostical</HI> Conjunction; a Word which denotes the mutual Transformation of Sexes, the Effect of that Configuration of the Celestial Bodies; the human Males being to be turned into Females, and the human Females into Males. As to Brutes, Antiquity is divided; nor will I interpose amongst those eminent Personages, or anticipate what the Event of a few Days will determine.</P>
<P>The <HI>Egyptians</HI> have represented this great Transformation by se∣veral very significant Hieroglyphicks, particularly one very remarka∣ble. There are carv'd upon an Obelisk, a <HI>Barber</HI> and a <HI>Midwife;</HI> the Barber delivers his Razor to the Midwife, and she her Swadling Cloaths to the Barber.</P>
<P>Accordingly <HI>Thales Milesius</HI> (who, like the rest of his Country∣men, borrow'd his Learning from the <HI>Aegyptians</HI>) after having com∣puted the Time of this famous Conjunction, <HI>Then,</HI> says he, <HI>shall Men and Women mutually exchange the Pangs of Shaving and Child∣bearing.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="3"/>
<HI>Anaximander</HI> modestly describes this Metamorphosis in Mathema∣tical Terms: <HI>Then,</HI> says he, <HI>shall the negative Quantity of the Wo∣men be turn'd into positive, their − into +;</HI> (i. e.) their <HI>less</HI> into <HI>more.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Plato</HI> not only speaks of this great Change, but describes all the Preparations towards it. <Q REND="inline">"Long before the bodily Transformation (says he) Nature shall begin the most difficult Part of her Work, by changing the Ideas and Inclinations of the two Sexes; Men shall turn effeminate, and Women manly; Wives shall domineer, and Husbands obey; Ladies shall ride a Horseback, dress'd like Cavaliers; Princes and Nobles appear in Night-trails and Petticoats; Men shall squeak upon Theatres with Female Voices, and Wo∣men corrupt Virgins; Men shall knot and cut Paper; and even the <HI>Northern</HI> People, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: A Phrase (which for Modesty's Sake I forbear to translate) which denotes a Vice too frequent amongst us."</Q> So far <HI>Plato.</HI></P>
<P>Nor was our own <HI>Merlin</HI> ignorant of this Transformation; wit∣ness that mysterious Stanza of his, the Meaning of which is now plain.<Q><L><HI REND="blackletterType">Then a Ministry full wise,</HI></L>
<L><HI REND="blackletterType">When they have spoil'd the Plotter's Guize,</HI></L>
<L><HI REND="blackletterType">Shall hang a Man right quickely,</HI></L>
<L><HI REND="blackletterType">Before he can plead his Bell—y.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>That the Ministry foresaw this great Change, is plain from the <HI>Callico-Act;</HI> whereby it is now become the Occupation of the Wo∣men all over <HI>England,</HI> to convert their useless Female Habits into Beds, Window-Curtains, Chairs, and Joint-stools; undressing them∣selves (as it were) before their Transformation.</P>
<P>The Philosophy of this Transformation will not seem surprizing to People, who search into the <HI>Bottom</HI> of Things. Madam <HI>Bourignon,</HI> a devout <HI>French</HI> Lady, has shewn us, how Man was at first created Male and Female in one Individual, having the Faculty of Propaga∣tion within himself: A Circumstance necessary to the State of Inno∣cence, wherein a Man's Happiness was not to depend upon the Ca∣price of another. It was not till after he had made a <HI>faux pas,</HI> that he had his Female Mate, (first join'd to him as the <HI>Bohemian</HI> Girls were join'd, and then separated.) Many such Trans∣formations of Individuals have been well attested; particularly one by <HI>Montaigne,</HI> and another by the late Bishop of <HI>Salisbury.</HI> From all which it appears, that this System of Male and Female has alrea∣dy undergone, and may hereafter suffer several Alterations. Every Smatterer in Anatomy knows, that a Woman is but an introverted Man; a new Fusion and <HI>Flatus</HI> will turn the hollow Bottom of a Bottle into a Convexity; but I forbear, (for the Sake of my Men Readers, who are in a few Days to be Virgins.)</P>
<P>In some Subjects, the smallest Alterations will do; some Men are sufficiently spread about the Hips, and contriv'd with that Female Softness, that they want only the Negative Quantity to make them Buxon Wenches; and there are Women who are, as it were, al∣ready the <HI>Ebauche</HI> of a good sturdy Man. If Nature cou'd be puzzl'd,
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
it will be how to bestow the redundant Matter of the exuberant Bubbies that now appear about Town, or to roll out the short dap∣per Fellows into well-siz'd Women.</P>
<P><HI>Aristotle</HI> has with great Nicety determin'd the Case of Eunuchs and Hermophrodites. <HI>The first,</HI> says he, <HI>will be transform'd into Bar∣ren Women,</HI> (I suppose he means like a spay'd Hen.) <HI>The second will change their predominant Inclination:</HI> I am glad of this Cir∣cumstance of Eunuchs, because the Opera will not be interrupted by their big Bellies.</P>
<P>This great Conjunction will begin to operate on <HI>Satur∣day</HI> the 29th Instant. Accordingly, about Eight at Night, as <HI>Senzino</HI> begins, <HI>Si videte, Did you but see?</HI> He shall be observ'd to make an unusual Motion; upon which the Audience will be af∣fected with a red Suffusion over their Countenance: And because a strong Succussion of the Muscles of the Belly is necessary towards performing this great Operation, both Sexes will be thrown into a profuse involuntary Laughter; then (to use the modest Terms of <HI>Anaximander</HI>) shall negative Quantity be turn'd into positive, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Time never beheld, nor will it ever assemble such a Number of un∣touch'd Virgins within those Walls; but alas! such will be the Im∣patience and Curiosity of People to act in their new Capacity, that many of them will go to Pot that very Night. To prevent the Disorders that may happen upon this Occasion, is the chief Design of this Paper.</P>
<P>Gentlemen have begun already to make use of this Conjunction to compass their filthy Purposes. They tell the Ladies forsooth, that it is only parting with a perishable Commodity; hardly of so much Va∣lue as a Callico Under-petticoat, since, like its Mistress, it will be use∣less in the Form it is now in. If the Ladies have no Regard to the Disho∣nour and Immorality of the Action, I desire they will consider that Nature, who never destroys her own Productions, will exempt big-bel∣ly'd Women till the Time of their Lying-in; so that not to be trans∣form'd, will be the same as to be pregnant. If they don't think it worth while to defend a Fortress that is to be demolish'd in a few Days, let them reflect that it will be a melancholly thing Nine Months hence, to be brought to Bed of a Bastard; a posthumous Bastard as it were, to which the <HI>Quondam</HI> Father can be no more than a dry Nurse.</P>
<P>This wonderful Transformation is the Instrument of Nature, to balance Matters between the Sexes. Then shall the Cruelty of scorn∣ful Mistresses be return'd, and they forc'd to sue to their new form'd Lovers with yet stronger Desires: Happy Lovers shall repay in kind the Favours they have receiv'd, and be as bless'd as their fellow Worms of the Earth, who (contemptible as they seem) are fram'd by Nature to enjoy both Pleasures. The slighted Maid shall grow into an imperious Gallant, and reward her Undoer with a big Belly, and a Bastard. The Coquette Wife shall turn the jealous Husband; and every Individual shall be able to decide the Question so much dis∣puted, concerning the comparative Delights of the Sexes.</P>
<P>It is hardly possible to imagine the Revolutions that this wonderful Phaenomenon will occasion over the Face of the Earth. I long impatient∣ly to see the Proceedings of the Parliament of <HI>Paris,</HI> as to the Title of
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
Succession to their Crown; this being a Case not provided for by the <HI>Salique</HI> Law. There will be no preventing Disorders amongst Friars and Monks; for certainly Vows of Chastity don't bind but under the Sex in which they were made. The same will hold good with Marriages, tho' I think it will be a Scandal amongst Protestants for Husbands and Wives to part, since there remains still a possibility to perform the <HI>Debitum Conjugale</HI> by the Husband being <HI>femme Couverte.</HI> I submit it to the Judgment of the Gentlemen of the Long Robe, whether this Transformation does not discharge all Suits of Rapes?</P>
<P>The Pope must undergo a new groping; but the false Prophet <HI>Mahomet</HI> has contriv'd Matters well for his Successors; for as the Grand Signior has now a great many fine Women, he will then have as many fine young Gentlemen at his Devotion.</P>
<P>These are surprizing Scenes, but I beg leave to affirm, that the solemn Operations of Nature are Subjects of Contemplation, but not of Ridicule; therefore I make it my earnest Request to the merry Fellows, and giggling Girls about Town, that they would not put themselves in a high Twitter, when they go to visit a General Ly∣ing-in of his first Child; his Officers serving as Midwives, Nurses and Rockers, dispensing Caudle; or if they behold the Reverend Prelates dressing the Heads and airing the Linnen at Court, I beg they will remember that these Offices must be fill'd with People of the greatest Regularity, and best Characters. For the same Rea∣son, I am sorry that a certain Prelate, who notwithstanding his Con∣finement, still preserves his healthy, chearful Countenance, cannot come in time to be a Nurse at Court.</P>
<P>I likewise earnestly intreat the Maids of Honour, (then Ensign and Captains of the Guards,) that at their first setting out, they have some Regard to their former Station; and not run wild through all the infamous Houses about Town. That the present Grooms of the Bed-Chamber (the Maids of Honour) would not eat Chalk and Lime in their Green-Sickness: And in general, that the Men would remember that they are then become <HI>Retromingent,</HI> and not by In∣advertency lift up against Walls and Posts. Petticoats will not be burdensome to the Clergy; but Balls and Assemblies will be inde∣cent for some Time.</P>
<P>As for you, Coquettes, Bawds, and Chambermaids, (the future Ministers, Plenipotentiaries and Cabinet-Counsellors to the Princes of the Earth,) manage the great Intrigues that will be committed to your Charge, with your usual Secrecy and Conduct; and the Affairs of your Masters will go better than ever.</P>
<P>O ye <HI>Exchange</HI> Women (our Right Worshipful Representatives that are to be) be not so griping in the Sale of your Ware as your Predecessors, but consider that the Nation, like a spend-thrift Heir, has run out: Be likewise a little more continent in your Tongues than you are at present, else the Length of Debates will spoil your Dinners.</P>
<P>You Housewively good Women, who now preside over the Con∣jectionary, (henceforth Commissioners of the <HI>Treasury</HI>) be so good as to dispense the Sugar Plumbs of the Government with a more impartial and frugal Hand. Ye Prudes and censorious old Maids, (the Hopes of the <HI>Bench</HI>) exert but your usual Talent of find∣ing Faults, and the Laws will be strictly executed; only I would
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
not have you proceed upon such slender Evidences as you have done hitherto. It is from you, eloquent Oyster-Merchants of <HI>Billingsgate,</HI> (just ready to be call'd to the Bar, and quoif'd like your Sister-Ser∣jeants,) that we expect the shortening the Time, and lessening the Expences of Law-Suits: For I think you are observ'd to bring your Debates to a short Issue; and even Custom will refrain you from ta∣king the Oyster, and leaving only the Shell to your Clients. O ye Priests, who now in a clandestine Way exercise your Office of coupling, when you continue your Practice in a lower Sphere, I question not but you will be more successful than you have been hitherto, in pleasing both Parties. O ye Physicians, who in the Figure of old Women are to clean the Tripe in the Markets; scour it as effectually as you have done that of your Patients, and the Town will fare most deliciously on <HI>Saturdays.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot but congratulate human Nature, upon this happy Trans∣formation; the only Expedient left to restore the Liberties and Tran∣quility of Mankind; which is so evident, that it is almost an Affront to common Sense to insist upon the Proof it. If there can be any such stupid Creature who doubts of it, I desire he will make but the fol∣lowing obvious Reflection: There are in <HI>Europe</HI> alone, at present, about a Million of sturdy Fellows, under the Denomination of stand∣ing Forces, with Arms in their Hands: That those are Masters of the Lives, Liberties and Fortunes of all the rest, I believe no body will deny. It is no less true in Fact, that Reams of Paper, and above a square Mile of Skins of Vellum have been employ'd to no Purpose, to settle Peace amongst those Sons of Violence. Pray, who is he that will say unto them, <HI>Go and disband your selves?</HI> But lo! by this Transformation it is done at once, and the <HI>Halcyon</HI> Days of publick Tranquillity return. For neither the military Temper nor Discipline can taint the soft Sex for a whole Age to come. <HI>Bellaque matribus invisa, Wars odious now to Mothers,</HI> will not grow imme∣diately palatable in their Paternal State.</P>
<P>Nor will the Influence of this Transformation be less in Family-Tranquillity than it is in National. Great Faults will be amended, and Frailties forgiven on both Sides. A Wife who has been di∣sturb'd with late Hours, and choak'd with the Hautgoût of a Sot, will remember her Sufferings, and avoid the Temptation; and will, for the same Reason, indulge her Mate in his female Capacity in some Passions, which she is sensible from Experience are natural to the Sex. Such as Vanity of fine Cloaths, being ad∣mir'd, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And how tenderly must she use her Mate under the breeding Qualms and Labour-Pains, which she felt her self? In short, all unreasonable Demands upon Husbands must cease, because they are already satisfy'd from natural Experience that they are impossi∣ble. That the Ladies may govern the Affairs of the World, and the Gentlemen those of their Houshold, better than either of them have hither done, is the hearty Desire of,</P>
