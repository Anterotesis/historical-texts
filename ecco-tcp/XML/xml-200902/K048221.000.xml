<HEAD>DEDICATION TO <HI>GEORGE COLMAN,</HI> ESQ.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM happy that the mode of dedication presents me with an opportunity of paying even so small a portion of that respectful tribute due to politeness, probity, and candour, as laying this Farce at your feet; but most particularly, I felicitate myself on an occasion of offering my acknowledgment of thanks, for the great part you bore in the success of the SON-IN-LAW. By the indulgent reception with which you fa∣voured my first piece, I was flattered into a desire, of attempting a second, when you first pointed out the principal material; and then, by your judicious alterations, happy additions, and strict attention to the conduct, you pro∣moted the SON-IN-LAW to whatever rank it now

may hold in the public favour. The town, possessed of judgment to perceive merit, and liberality to reward it, seems, by its beneficent patronage, sensible of your endeavours and abi∣lities, to render the drama upon your Theatre, what it should be, an entertainment of ele∣gance, instruction, and delight. That each purpose is amply answered, accept my sincere congratulation. With ardent wishes, that the generous warmth of public approbation may continue to cherish your hopes, and crown your deserts, I have the honour to remain,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>Your most obedient, Much obliged, and truly devoted humble servant, JOHN KEEFFE.</SIGNED>

<L>IF there's a Critick here, who hates what's <HI>LOW,</HI></L>
<L>We humbly beg the gentleman would go:</L>
<L>He's very welcome to have seen the Play,</L>
<L>To take his money back, and walk away.</L>
<L>Our Poet is the fearfull'st man on earth,</L>
<L>And fears too much four sense may spoil your mirth;</L>
<L>He wishes plain blunt folks, that laugh and cry,</L>
<L>As nature prompts, and ask no reason why.</L>
<L>To-night no <HI>Two-Act Comedy</HI> you'll view,</L>
<L>But a mere <HI>Farce!</HI> the characters not new,</L>
<L>And all your old acquaintance: <HI>Tony Lumpkin,</HI></L>
<L>In town, 'tis true, but still a country bumpkin.</L>
<L>His friend <HI>Tim Tickle</HI> too, who danc'd the bear;</L>
<L>Bruin, the bear himself—nay, never stare;</L>
<L>He shall not hurt you, ladies—keep your places!</L>
<L>The bear-leader has given him <HI>the graces.</HI></L>
<L>This rustic groupe, bear, boar-leader, 'Squire, Clown,</L>
<L>The frolick muse of Farce now drives to town.</L>
<L>Her elder sister, Comedy, has wit,</L>
<L>But Farce has fun, and oft' a lucky bit;</L>
<L>If she yields laugh, a laugh let none despise;</L>
<L>Be merry, if you can, and not <HI>too wise.</HI></L>

<P>Who should he make free with, if he wou'dn't with his fellow servants?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fellow servants, Mr. Diggory! Do you make no difference between a fellow in a livery, and a gentleman's gentleman? In the country, I suppose, it's "hail fellow, well met;" but here, sir, we are delicate, nice, in our distinctions; for a valet moves in a sphere, and lives in a stile as superior to a foot∣man, as a Pall-mall groom porter to the marker of a tennis-court.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>Dig.</SPEAKER>
<P>For certain, sir, we vale-de-shams are grand fellows; but you'll see more of that when I get on my new regimen—I mean my new liver;—psha! my new clothes, I mean. Did you breakfast, sir?</P>

<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a vulgar breakfast! beef! shocking!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dig.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know as to that, sir, but I have heard my old master, Mr. Hardcastle, say, that beef was Queen Elizabeth's breakfast; and, if that's the case, I think it's good enough for I.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>But isn't that for your master?</P>

<P>O, I'll leave enough for he, I'll warrant.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tick.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, Diggory! the London air agrees with you, I find; keep working, lad; strong beer is our stream of life, liberty our vital air, and in good beef lies the marrow of an English constitution—that's in the genteel way.</P>

<P>Aye! now how could he do without me? If he wants a coat cut in the kick, who can shew him? I—A tasty nab? Why Tim.—Handsome pumps? I know the go. If he'd have a tune from his music-master, a thrust from his pushing-master, a step from his dancing master, or a square from his boxing-master, I'm the boy that can shew him life in the genteel way.</P>

<P>They can do nothing without me. Tony Lumpkin's nobody without Tim Tickle. I'll go—no—I think I'll step first and give my bear his break∣fast; poor soul! many a good one he has got me; aye, and may again for aught I know. The 'Squire's good at a promise, that's certain; but what's a pro∣mise? Pye-crust. I'd no more depend upon a gem∣man's promise, than I would upon a broken staff, or a candidate for the county after he had gained his election.</P>

<SPEAKER>Jonq.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant he is not the most eligible compa∣nion for a man of fashion: but at a masquerade I was safe from censure, for every body imagined the un∣couthness
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>
of his appearance, and rusticity of his man∣ners, merely the effect of his imitative genius. The company thought his behaviour all assumed, put on <HI>pour l' occasion;</HI> for he threw off his domino, and I'll assure you, simple nature got him insinite reputation. He gaped at the masks, roared most stentoriously dis∣cordant with the musick; overset the pyramids, pock∣eted the sweetmeats, broke the glasses, made love to an Arcadian dairy maid, tripped up the heels of a har∣lequin, beat a hermit, who happened to be a captain in the guards, and gave a bishop a black eye.</P>

<P>Besides the money I have expended in my Flemish and Italian acquisition, during my tour, I have, at this moment, a pecuniary understanding with most of the eminent picture-dealers and auctio∣neers in town; and, consequently, the refusal of an∣tiques, coins, china, lap-dogs and original pictures.</P>

<P>How do you order it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jonq.</SPEAKER>
<P>Briefly thus: if an extraordinary engage∣ment prevents me from a private peep, previous to the sale, suppose me in the auction-room: a full sale, good pictures, my favourite piece, up, friend Mallet, in the heat of his oration, casts me an eye significant; I, unperceived by the company, return an affirmative signal; and one, two—down, the picture's mine for one third of the value.</P>

<P>In town?—no—no—Mr.—sir—if a mo∣dern ever intrudes upon a pannel of mine, taste must give the preference to Flemish and Italian; if the

Step into my shop a cro∣cus, and you walk out a narcissus; my sweet lip-salve can change a blubber to a pouting—a walnut to a cherry-lip. Then, sir, my perfumed powders con∣quer nature; I can give a lady a pink head, a green head, or a blue head. Do you know, sir, that I make the chymical Paphian wash, for eradicating hair; so innocent, it may be used by infants just born, and yet so powerful, that three ablutions give an Esau the hand of a Jacob?

<P>You've undone me, sir!</P>

<P>Who, I! as how?</P>

<SPEAKER>Tim.</SPEAKER>
<P>I said, at first, it was a damn'd stupid thing of you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dig.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you know, 'Squire, I told you, that none but an ass could think of such nonsense.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tony.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can you unwig 'em again?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paint.</SPEAKER>
<P>What will I get by that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jonq.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll give you fifty guineas,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paint.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lay it here,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jonq.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's the money; charm my longing eyes, once more, with the fight of my Rembrandt's dear, dear, black bonnet,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paint.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, sir, they're only done in water colour; so a wet towel and a little soap settles their <HI>wigs</HI> in five minutes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jonq.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tol de rol, loll. Give me your hand; I was dreadfully alarmed; but now I can laugh at it. Ha! ha! ha! what a whimsical thought! but, you stupid rogue, why would you ruin the women?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paint.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never ruin'd a woman in my life, sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jonq.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mean, why would you put wigs upon the ladies?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paint.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sure it's the fashion now for all ladies to wear wigs. How charming they look! Poor fellows, ye must soon lose your grandeur!</P>

<SP>

<P>That's the gentleman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tony.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Tim, d'ye hear my cousin? Will you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look'ee, 'Squire; this here harmless soul, this bear of mine, has maintained me some years, when I could not do for myself; and though, thanks to my good breeding, I'm grown polite enough to be a gent∣leman's tutor, yet I'll never be so much in the fa∣shion as to forsake an old benefactor.</P>

<P>I wish I could get any regular family to board him with: enquire among your acquaintance, sir.</P>

<PB N="37" REF="43"/>
<SPEAKER>Jonq.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I'll do myself the honour to en∣quire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tony.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bruin's a lad of few words, but he's as ci∣vil a fellow as ever stood upon two legs. But, cousin Jonquil, I won't offer you your fifty guineas you gave the painter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jonq.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say no more; you meant well, and that palliates the confequence. But, for Rubens' sake, forego your pretensions in future to a taste in pictures.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tony.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I know the points of a horse, and that's made by a better workman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jonq.</SPEAKER>
<P>Therefore, to the knowledge of horses and dogs, like a true 'Squire, from this moment confine your claim; for if a man will, in opposition to nature, meddle with matters of which he is fo extremely ig∣norant, he must inevitably render himself the object of ridicule and laughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tony.</SPEAKER>
<P>Laughter! and what's pleasanter than a laugh? By jingo, a laugh is all I wanted.</P>
<L>If I've rais'd some sweet smiles on those lovely fair faces,</L>
<L>I am glad I put wigs on their sisters, the Graces:</L>
<L>I would not offend you for more than I'll mention;</L>
<L>To please all my friends, was my only intention.</L>
