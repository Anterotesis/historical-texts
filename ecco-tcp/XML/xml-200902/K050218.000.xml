<P>What a strange incident, my marrying this old Mr Cockletop; 'pon my honour, was I single, I'd have the most beautiful Theatre in my house, and his nephew Frank, shou'd be the Manager, of late he looks at me in a very particular manner; I can scarce think it possible for these features, to strike any body with admiration.</P>

<P>Work! Oh heavens, if Shakespeare cou'd have taken a peep at them, ha, ha, ha! Romeo and Juliet the play; the hero, on breaking open the tomb, totally forgot what he had to say next; in vain, the prompter whispers the word; poor Juliet might have remained in Capulet's Monument, 'till Doomsday; at length impatient; (for it grew monstrous cold) I softly bid him speak; why don't you speak? <HI>He,</HI> taking it, for what he should say, with all the fervor of distract∣ted love, burst out "speak, speak, why don't you speak."

<P><STAGE>(recovering.)</STAGE> Comforted, did you say? how is that possible, my dear Mrs Camomile, when I've heard you yourself remark that mourning don't become me —though if I was to dress like Almeria in the Mourn∣ing Bride—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs Ca.</SPEAKER>
<P>To confess the truth, I was afraid to tell you, but I before knew of this melancholy event, and there that foolish boy your nephew Frank, through his zealous respect for the memory of his uncle, has, contrary to all custom and decorum, already ordered the whole family to put on the black clothes that were only t'other day laid by when the mourning for your brother-in-law expir'd.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, you're very obliging.</P>

<P>I see his loss bears hard upon your mind, therefore it mayn't be proper so soon troubling you with worldly affairs—but now my dear, you'll have no

children of your own, indeed you should think of some establishment for your niece Belinda.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll first establish my husband's nephew Frank, merely to shew I prefer my dear man's relations to my own.</P>

<P>This will answer the same purpose, as Frank marries Belinda, <STAGE>(aside.)</STAGE>—Well shall I tell the lad your good intentions towards him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs C.</SPEAKER>
<P>You're very good, I'll tell him myself— but I'll first consult you my good friend on the thoughts I have in my mind how to make him happy, but in my interview with the boy I wouldn't have any body else by; the hour of sorrow's sacred, it's a cruel world, and people luxurious, sensual, gay, and fortunate, have no feeling for the disconsolate, widow.</P>
