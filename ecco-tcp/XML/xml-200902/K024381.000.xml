<P>Here, my friends, here stands the castle of Lovinski.—This cruel Polander is the scourge of his own little territory, and a devouring plague to our Tartar tribes; but the hour of retri∣bution is at hand.—We are too few to storm it now; to-morrow's dawn—I lose time.—Attend; line all the outlets of the forest, and seize on every passenger you meet with; but, I command you, spare the lives of those who fall into your hands.—Remem∣ber, my brave comrades, the innocent should ne∣ver suffer for the guilty, nor must we purchase our revenge at the price of justice and humanity.— To your posts;—begone.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Varbel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Vastly well, Sir, vastly well; you seem in tip top spirits; sing away, sing away. I told you I saw the Portmantua fall; but the Tartars have gallop'd clear off with the poor beasts; I thought them as safe grazing there, as if they had been in our own stables.—Well, we have miss'd the road to the village, and here we are, wand'ring on foot, in the heart of the forest of Ostropol.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Count.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was your fault, that they discovered the horses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Varbel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and it was my fault too, that they did not discover us.—A house!—then all my fears are over. I thought we should never have found an end to this black wood; and, to tell you the truth, I had made up my mind to the comfortable pros∣pect of passing the night in the arms of one of the bears that were howling about us.—Won't you go in, Sir?—though I see nobody there to open the door to us.</P>

<P>I know what you should not have done; you shouldn't have giv'n your vote to a candidate, who was oppos'd by your mistress's proud father.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Count.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not given it?—Called to the election o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a king, honour exacted the performance of my promise; my friend obtain'd the crown of Poland; I discharged my duty to my country; and we should hold every sacrifice cheap, to maintain a good man on a throne.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Varbel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, Sir; but, all of a sudden, you seem to forget, that, for that very reason, prince Lupauski has discharged himself of his promise to give you his daughter Lodoiska.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Count.</SPEAKER>
<P>Cruel father! Why so mysteriously con∣ceal the place of her retreat?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Varbel.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, dear Sir, consider, she can't be con∣ceal'd for ever. Now wou'dn't it be more natural to get back to Warsaw as fast as we can, and wait there, 'till her father sends for the princess home again? It must happen sooner or later. That's certainly the best way ; and, for my part, I won't budge a step further for all the Lodoiskas in Christendom.</P>

<P>Is this your regard, your fidelity? Come on this moment, or—</P>

<P>Sir, recollect, we have fasted all day: I can't live upon love, if you can; I am almost starv'd, and I must eat.—I did not fetch the port∣mantean for nothing.—I can't stir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Wretch! you are for ever embittering
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>my griefs with your upbraidings!—Why wou'd you follow me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Varbel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why?—why wou'd I follow you? Why, because my heart got the better of my head, and made me resolve, in spite of common sense, to ac∣company your search, that I might carry half the load of your griefs for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Count.</SPEAKER>
<P>Forgive me, my true fellow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Varbel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, don't be melancholy; I won't eat, if you don't like it.—I must try to divert him, —It's I that have most cause to be out of spirits; every thing going on so smooth with the old prince, the happy morning fix'd with the young princess; —there was I practising how to behave myself, as master of the ceremonies, among the musicians, singers, dancers, lords and ladies, on your wedding day.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Baron.</SPEAKER>
<P>Know'st thou aught of their contents?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Baron.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lodoiska!—Has he then divulg'd the place of her retreat?—Tell me, where is Lupauski now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Being on his progress to assemble the confederates, I cannot tell precisely where he is; but, I know, his letters likewise said, that you might soon expect him here.</P>

<P>Not here?</P>

<P>Not here.—Do you mark his emotion?— To oblige the prince, I undertook, against my will, to guard her in this castle from the Count

</SP>
<SP>

<P>Sir! Sir!—hist, hist.—Have you found her? Why don't you speak to one now?—He's not here.—I thought I heard him this moment too. So, I have lost my master in the dark, and now, if any of the gentlemen of this humane family happen to stumble upon me, my poor dear life's not worth a minute's purchase.—He's poring about after his Lodoiska; the deuse a bit does he think of me.—Though our window was double and treble barr'd, and barricado'd, he burst away the bolts with a snap of his finger; and, I believe, like Mr. What d'ye call him, he'd have burst the gates of Hell to come at his mistress.—I can't con∣ceive what's the matter with me to night; I see Spectres and Phantoms before me at every turn.— If a man cou'd administer courage to himself when he wanted it, I'd take a good dose of it now; and yet, I dare say, some people wou'd be much more fright∣en'd than I am.—Mercy on us! what's that?</P>
