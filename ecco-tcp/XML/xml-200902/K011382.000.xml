<P>IN what a restless State have I pass'd these few late Hours! My Fears of miscarrying in the ne∣cessary Attempt, join'd to the Charms of my fair In∣structress, have banish'd Sleep as far from my Eyes, as Possession of the dear Object wou'd Sorrow from my Heart. What an unaccountable Revolution has this Girl caused in me! One Evening's Conversation has metamorphos'd me, from the avow'd Friend of Dissipation and Riot, to an unalterable Advocate for Matrimony, domestic Pleasures, pretty Children, and the main Chance.</P>

<P>What, <HI>Ned Gilbert,</HI> up and garter'd before Eleven! Why, what in the name of the Lark, makes you such an early Riser? Perhaps bad Wine and worse Company had Charms sufficient to rival your Pillow, and keep you up all Night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gilb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not so, upon my Honour. I went soberly to Rest at Twelve; but my Pillow and I never agreed worse: There was no Part of it cou'd please me. But, when I account for our Quarrel, you will cer∣tainly indulge in a hearty Laugh. In short, after I left you at <HI>George</HI>'s I went to <HI>Ranelagh,</HI> where <HI>Townly</HI> introduc'd me to one of the most amiable, elegant, sprightly, bewitching Females—that ever made Mortal melancholy.</P>

<P>But, <HI>Ned,</HI> I shou'd suppose her more than Mortal that cou'd make you so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gilb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never was Man so chang'd. I drew <HI>Townly</HI> aside, made a short Inquiry into her Family and Character; and, finding both unexceptionable, I made a formal Declaration of an honourable Passion; which the dear Girl receiv'd in a most easy, open, becoming Manner.</P>

<P>But, pray, did <HI>Townly</HI> introduce you by your real Name of <HI>Gilbert.</HI></P>

<P>No, no—as Mr. <HI>George Heartly,</HI> the Name by which I pass here at my Lodging: For he knows,
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>shou'd the News of my being from <HI>Oxford,</HI> reach <HI>Norfolk,</HI> the old Gentleman might be in the Pouts. But to proceed—She told me she was generally close confin'd by her Father, who was then in the Country on some Family Business; that Gold given to her Keeper had procur'd her a short Jubilee that wou'd expire at her Father's Return, which was expected almost as soon as her's.</P>

<P>Well, this is as strange a Metamorphosis as any in <HI>Ovid!</HI> but I believe it is only the Fore-runner of another. A Month's Possession of the desired Ob∣ject, will convince him, however easily trapp'd, he is not long to be caged. Love, quotha! he has been as often in love, as he calls it, as I have been at short Commons; and has changed his Mind much oftener, than I my Livery. I thought something was gathering in the Wind when I let him in last Night. He was very eager to get to Bed too, which is never the Case, but when his Heart's full or his Purse empty. I foresee a World of Difficulty in this Busi∣ness. So much the better—for, as he has but few Friends in Town, I must needs be a Party in the Plot—and when once I am deeply engag'd in the Secret—if I don't get well paid for keeping it, why then—But hold! Will that be honest? May be not —but 'twill be very convenient; and that's the first Thing to be consider'd.</P>

<P>My dear <HI>Lucy,</HI> start no more Objections, for I am determined to be pleased with the Adven∣ture. His Address so easy! his Conversation so en∣gaging! and when he made the wished-for Declara∣tion, it was attended with such Openness, and, at the same Time, such unaffected Delicacy, that I soon bad adieu to Reserve, and gave him ample Leave to hope the best. I laid before nim the Difficulty of a Correspondence — but at that Instant, <HI>Cupid,</HI> be thanked! I thought of an Expedient to introduce him.
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>I expect him presently in the Disguise of a foreign Tutor, lately recommended to my Father. If the real Master should make his Appearance, we must employ my Gold, and your Smiles, upon that old Hypocrite <HI>Robin,</HI> and so get him dismissed.</P>

<P>My Father's Business was as important as disa∣greeable. There has been a Relation with him, one Mr. <HI>Trapwell,</HI> of <HI>Oxford,</HI> who has given him Information of a young Gentleman's Arrival in Town, whose Name is <HI>Gilbert.</HI> He mentions him as a Man of great Fortune, and has promis'd, on his Return from <HI>Colchester,</HI> for which Place he has just set off, to introduce him to our Family. My Father seems consident a Meeting will produce a Match. But, on my putting a few Negatives on the Matter, he has thought sit to confine me
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>closer than ever. I am not to see any Body; so your Disguise will avail but little. It is with Diffi∣culty I write and send this. On any Alteration, will endeavour to give you the earliest Notice.</P>

<P>So, I am my own Rival at last! A very whimsical Circumstance!</P>

<P>A very lucky one, I think; for now you have nothing to do, but to make an immediate Dis∣covery of your Situation to the old Fellow, and the Affair will undoubtedly take a favourable Turn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gilb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not very clear in that. What you mention might produce the desir'd Effect, if I had not appear'd before him in my borrow'd Shape, which you are sensible must make a Part of the Ex∣planation: And who knows but such a Step may, in his Eyes, give me too much the Air of an Adven∣turer, and lead him to make Inquiries, which, you know, will not be at all convenient: Nay, he may think it necessary to consult my Father; and, if in the End it should not prove agreeable to my old Gentleman, I shall repent my frank Confession, as it will undoubtedly deprive me of all future Oppor∣tunities of visiting <HI>Celia</HI> in my feign'd Character; and I am determin'd not to give her up.</P>
</SP>

<P>What you say is very true: Nay, perhaps, she too may think you have dealt rather indirectly, and have <HI>her</HI> Suspicions.</P>

<SPEAKER>Gilb.</SPEAKER>
<P>None, but what a Quarter of an Hour's Conversation will remove—But, how to gain that? Egad, I have a Thought.—Suppose I make my Rascal <HI>Smatter,</HI> personate me. He may find a thousand Ways of introducing himself. This will, at least, give me an Opportunity of conveying the Situation of Affairs in a Letter to the dear Girl. Nay, perhaps, procure her Liberty; which, if she makes a proper Use of, we'll put the finishing Stroke to the Affair, before the Return of my <HI>Oxford</HI> Friend, <HI>Trapwell:</HI> And when my Father arrives, the three old Fellows

<P>I am beholden to him, Sir, on many Occa∣sions, but singularly so in this; as you are a Person, whose good Opinion I particularly stand in Need of, Sir, I shall freely communicate — I have lately been favoured with a Glance or two from a fair Eye, posted in one of your Windows.

<STAGE>Enter Sir <HI>Ralph Gilbert, Roger,</HI> and <HI>Servant.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Ra.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Is Mr. <HI>Lockworth</HI> at home, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Ra.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>If he is at Leisure, I shou'd be glad to speak to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serv.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Master's here, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Lockworth.</STAGE>
<STAGE>[With Parchments as going to his Lawyer.]</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Servant, Sir! Your Business with me, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Ra.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir I was desir'd to call here, to discourse with you on a Matter of some Consequence, by my Friend and your Relation, Mr. <HI>Trapwell.</HI> I met him at <HI>Chelmsford,</HI> in his Way to <HI>Colchester.</HI> He told me he should return in a few Days, and in the mean Time, his Name wou'd be a sufficient Passport for me to you and your worthy Family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I shall at all Times be glad to pay proper Regard to my Friend's Recommendation; but I have a Matter of Moment in Hand, and must beg the Favour of seeing you in the Morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir Ra.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my Heart, Sir: But in the Inte∣rim, Sir—Pardon an old Fellow's Importunity—will you indulge me with a Sight of your fair Daughter? For, to be free, my Visit is chiefly to her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, Sir, to be as free—My Daughter is at present engaged in a Way, that to her m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st be more agreeable than entertaining either to you or me. In short, Sir, she is with her Lover—And I am now going to my Lawyer with these Papers, in order to prepare the necessary Articles of Marriage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Ra.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say you so, Sir? O then my Hopes are at an End.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, pray, Sir, had you Hopes of marrying my Daughter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Ra.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not I, indeed, Sir, but I had Thoughts of recommending a Son.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, 'tis too late; my Girl's dispos'd of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Ra.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Sir—not to be too troublesome—On whom have you bestow'd this Jewel?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I have bestow'd her, if so you term it, on Mr. <HI>Gilbert,</HI> Son of one Sir <HI>Ralph Gilbert</HI> of <HI>Nor∣folk.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Ra.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hey dey! But, Sir, don't you think you would have shewn a little more Prudence, by wait∣ing 'till you had obtain'd his Father's Consent?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I hope you don't think me an Ideot. I had the Father's Consent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Ra.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Devil you had! Pray, Sir, how did you get it, and when?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, you are very free in your Enquiries. But as to your How, I promise you I did not extort it; and as to your When, I say, within this Hour. His Son brought him here; and he seem'd as eager for the Match as either of the young Couple.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Ra.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, either you or I must be in a Dream. I never was with you before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I don't pretend to say you was. But, pray, Sir, may I crave your Name.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Ra.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I am Sir <HI>Ralph Gilbert</HI> of <HI>Norfolk.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, so he is; and I'll swear it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say you so! I begin to fear some Trick. Within there!</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter Servant.</STAGE>
<P>Run to Mr. <HI>Gilbert</HI>'s Lodging, and desire him and my Daughter to come hither instantly—</P>
<STAGE>Exit Servant.</STAGE>
<P>Sir, have you any Proof you are the true Sir <HI>Ralph Gilbert?</HI></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Ra.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not about me, Sir. But I can support my Assertion by the Testimony of many Persons of Cre∣dit here in Town. But, Sir, if there is any Trick on the Carpet, I hope I am arriv'd soon enough to prevent the Execution of it. Perhaps you are no more secure as to the Identity of my Son's Person than mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really, Sir, I am at a Loss what to say —but it will soon be explain'd, for here comes <HI>my</HI> Mr. <HI>Gilbert.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Say you so! On my Word, Sir, you may claim him when you please; I shall never dispute the Property.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Lockworth,</HI> your most devoted! Your Servant tells me you are in some Disorder; and as I now look upon myself as a Part of the Family, I shall do every Thing in my Power to promote its Tranquillity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Ra.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, hold! ha!—No.—Yes it is that very Rascal his Man. Pray, Sir, where is your hope∣ful Master?</P>

<P>Sirrah, answer <HI>me.</HI> Where have you left your intended Bride?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>
<SPEAKER>Smat.</SPEAKER>
<P>My <HI>intended</HI> Bride! Sir, you must think very strangely of me to believe, that I, who have not been ten Minutes married to a first Wife, should have already cast my Eye on a Second.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, are you then fast married?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smat.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am, Sir, Thanks to the Priest, the La∣dy's Inclination, and my own Industry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Undone! Undone!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Ra.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, now the Riddle's out! this Fellow has taken my Son's Name upon him, and all his Freaks and Irregularities have been laid at poor <HI>Ned</HI>'s Door. I have been censuring my poor Boy's Conduct, as an Idler here in <HI>London,</HI> while he has been closely pursuing his Studies at the University. But, sweet Sir, let me have the Satisfaction of seeing the Lady you have so much honoured.</P>

<P>What! what Mockery is this?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smat.</SPEAKER>
<P>No Mockery, Sir, 'tis Reality.—This is my Bride.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is this true, <HI>Lucy?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Even so, Sir. I once in my Life forgot my good Manners, and took the Lead of my Bet∣ters.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am still in a Cloud! Where's my Daugh∣ter?</P>
</SP>

<P>Hey! how! <HI>Ned!</HI> why 'tis <HI>Ned!</HI>— Sirrah, explain yourself—What do you mean by these Vagaries?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, <HI>Sir Ralph,</HI> do you know <HI>Domine?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Ra.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Domine!</HI> What do you mean by <HI>Domine?</HI> This is my Boy <HI>Ned.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lock.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, <HI>Sir Ralph!</HI> Is this really your Son?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Ra.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope so. I am sure I can answer for my Wife's Part in him at least, But. Sirrah. <HI>Ned</HI> how durst you take this irregular Trip from <HI>Oxford,</HI> and trump up a Marriage without my Consent?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear <HI>Sir Ralph,</HI> let him account for that at Leisure this is no Time for Wrangling. By the Beginning of your Conversation, I am convinc'd the Match cannot be disagreeable to you: And, for my Part, I am so well pleas'd to find my Daughter has been led by Chance, to the Person my coolest Judg∣ment wou'd have chosen, that I shall bury in Oblivion all Thoughts of the Intent, and make myself happy by reflecting on the pleasing Consequence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Celia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I knew, some Time before this Affair came to a Crisis, this was the Gentleman you in∣tended for me; but some Circumstances that attended our first Converse, made an Explanation wholly im∣proper. Depend on't, Sir, though I might not have implicitly obey'd your Commands, by taking whom∣soever you pleas'd to recommend, yet my Duty would not have suffer'd an Union with any Person, whose Character or Conduct could give you the least Offence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lock.</SPEAKER>
<P>You foolish wise Baggage, hold your Tongue, and don't attempt to mend Things when they are at the best.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smat.</SPEAKER>
<P>On my Word, Sir, I am afraid I'm at the
<PB N="34" REF="33"/>best, and yet I want mending. We all know what we are, but none of us know what we may be, as my Friend <HI>Shakespeare</HI> has it. I hope, Sir,
<STAGE>[to Sir Ralph.]</STAGE> there will need no great Rhetoric to per∣swade you to forgive my being concern'd in a Plot, the Catastrophe of which has turn'd out so much to the Satisfaction of all Parties. And, Sir,
<STAGE>[to young Gilbert]</STAGE> All I ask of you as a Reward for my trifling Services, is, that Spousy and I may remain as followers of your good Fortunes, and be daily Witnesses of the Happiness we have endeavour'd to promote.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gilb. Smatter,</SPEAKER>
<P>I am bound to you; and shall have a Pleasure in making the Return you wish. Now, my dear <HI>Celia,</HI> our Happiness is complete; and, don't think much of my Presumption, when I venture to declare it lasting.</P>
