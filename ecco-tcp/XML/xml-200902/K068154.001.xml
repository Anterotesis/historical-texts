<HEAD>DEDICATION. TO WILLIAM DAVIS, ESQ.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>If ever dedication had a legitimate motive, this has.</P>
<P>The recollection of a friend's having witnessed the first dawnings of my poetical and musical ideas—his kind partiality to them—his friendship and liberality in promoting a scheme for my benefit—his handsome con∣duct in forgetting that, at the instigation of unprin∣cipled men, I believed him to have been unfaithful to his promises: In fine, the variety of instances in which he has proved himself such a friend as no man but myself could ever boast of:—</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="6"/>
These not only point out the most perfect propriety in my making an acknowledgment of my obligations, but would also mark me as very unworthy of them if I neg∣lected to seize so becoming an opportunity of inviting the public to bear testimony to my high sense of such kind∣ness.</P>
<P>You, Sir, are the friend thus described. The facts I have spoken of exist. And, as I slatter myself you will allow that ingratitude makes no part of my dispo∣sition, it cannot surprize you that I endeavour to do you common justice.</P>
<P>So well, however, do I know you, that you will wonder I should conceive it necessary to mention those kindnesses as a favour which you conferred for your own gratification.</P>
<P>I beg leave, nevertheless, to be excused if I put in my claim for a little gratification too; for, as nothing ever gave me more pleasure than this proper address—the spirit of which, I beg leave to assure you, is us pure
<PB N="iii" REF="7"/>
as honour, and the letter as sincere as truth—so I know nothing that could have been a severer mortification to me than to have been prevented from the satisfaction of thus telling you how truly</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>So many opinions have been hazarded, by cavillers, on the subject of the following songs, that it would be almost a tacit acquiescence in the folly, ignorance, and absurdity of such opinions, were I to do myself and the public so much injustice as to let this oppor∣tunity pass without giving them their merited no∣tice.</P>
<P>Were I disposed to pleasantry, I might say with my Irishman, that <Q REND="inline">"the proper notice would be no notice at all:"</Q>—and, indeed, were it not for the sake of simple truth and common justice, such calum∣niators might as well pass unregarded; for envy is as natural to dunces as hunger, and what should they seek to satisfy but the cravings of their appetites?</P>
<P>As, however, there is something seriously material in attending to whatever in the slightest degree re∣gards the public, I shall go a little into this business,
<PB N="ii" REF="9"/>
if it be only to shew how tiny and ineffectual are the yelpings of these literary curs, who, like true mon∣grels, never open but to do mischief.</P>
<P>It is remarkable that, throughout my whole public career, I have been nibbled at the heel by these mon∣grels of the muses, these slinking snarlers, who, the reverse of the dogs that guarded the fane of Diana, fawn upon vice, and cherish every thing but virtue.</P>
<P>When I composed the music of the Padlock, the cry was that I employed some Italian, for fifty pounds, to do that of which I was incapable. I smiled with contempt at the rumour, and the public very soon did me justice.</P>
<P>After this I had the temerity to write for myself. The villany of such an action was unpardonable; and it was immediately resolved to brand me with an as∣persion as false as it was invidious. Here I was obliged to assert my claim to a public hearing; and the consequence was, the town chose to allow that I
<PB N="iii" REF="10"/>
had as much right as any other person to the privi∣leges of a subject, and the feelings of a man.</P>
<P>This terrible disappointment to the snarlers awed them into a kind of sulky growl, which has never since broke out but very partially; and as petulance and soreness generally interpret every thing the wrong way, and defeat their own ends, so the malig∣nity of their sarcasms have not been more remarkable than their folly. They have attributed my sea songs to men who knew no more of nautical terms than an English sailor does of art or hypocrisy; they have made more blunders in detecting my Irish songs than the songs contain themselves; and in the investigation of my hunting songs they have been perpetually at fault.</P>
<P>A friend of mine, one evening, dropt in at a coffee-house where a number of these literary jurymen were holding an inquest over my murdered reputation.—He humoured the jest, and, before he had finished, proved, to the satisfaction of every one present, that
<PB N="iv" REF="11"/>
Poor Jack was a posthumous work of Dr. Johnson, that the Race Horse was written by the jockey who rode the famous Flying Childers, and that Blow high Blow low was the production of Admiral Keppel, who dictated the words to his secretary as he lay in his cot, after the memorable battle of the twenty-seventh of July, waiting for the French to try their force with him handsomely the next morning.</P>
<P>But the mischief of it is, these poor devils cannot discern that all they do to injure me gives me real consequence. The public are always sure to take up a man at whom the shafts of rancour are levelled.—If his efforts be nothing more than inoffensive, he is secure of protection in favour of his intentions; if meritorious, they know too well their own dignity not to rank him according to his deserts.</P>
<P>To that public I would make a solemn declaration that I am the sole author of every thing this book contains, but that they too well know the hue of truth
<PB N="v" REF="12"/>
to need an elucidation of it by any light I can place it in.</P>
<P>As however I do not wish to crush this vermin—on the contrary, I would have them crawl and nibble, for vermin are as necessary in the system of literature as in the system of the creation—I am willing to allow that there are plenty of faults in this work.</P>
<P>Yet, lest such reptiles should extend any fang with pleasure at these delicious tidings, I must insist that I could very often have written better had it not been for musical necessity, which, in some instances, precludes nerve, and, in others, requires it, when the reverse would probably have made the poetry read better.</P>
<P>All these considerations are very safe with the public at large, to whom I never can address myself without confessing more incapacity of expression than is attributed to me by the sourness of my heart-burnt enemies.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="13"/>
To these poor creatures, did I wish their deserts, I should be more cruel and injurious than they have it in their power to be to me.</P>

<HEAD>THE MILLER's DAUGHTER.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">IN THE DESERTER.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THERE was a miller's daughter</L>
<L>Liv'd in a certain village,</L>
<L>Who made a mighty slaughter:—</L>
<L>For I'd have you to know,</L>
<L>Both friend and foe,</L>
<L>The clown and the beau,</L>
<L>She always laid low;</L>
<L>And her portion, as I understand,</L>
<L>Was three acres of land,</L>
<L>Besides a mill,</L>
<L>That never stood still,</L>
<L>Some sheep and a cow,</L>
<L>A harrow and plough,</L>
<L>And other things for tillage:—</L>
<L>What d'ye think of the miller's daughter?</L>
</LG>
<LG N="2">
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<L>This miller's pretty daughter</L>
<L>Was a damsel of such fame, sir,</L>
<L>That knights and squires sought her;</L>
<L>But they soon were told</L>
<L>That some were too bold,</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="16"/>
And some too cold,</L>
<L>And some too old;</L>
<L>And she gave them to understand</L>
<L>That, though they were grand,</L>
<L>She'd never be sold:</L>
<L>For says Betty, says she,</L>
<L>' Since my virtue to me</L>
<L>' Is dearer than gold,</L>
<L>' You may go from whence you came, sir.'</L>
<L>What d'ye think of my miller's daughter.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="3">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<L>But when this miller's daughter</L>
<L>Saw Ned, the morrice dancer,</L>
<L>His person quickly caught her;</L>
<L>For who so clean</L>
<L>Upon the green,</L>
<L>As Ned was seen,</L>
<L>For her his queen:—</L>
<L>Then blithe as a king,</L>
<L>His bells he'd ring,</L>
<L>And dance, and sing,</L>
<L>Like any thing:—</L>
<L>Says he, 'My life,</L>
<L>' Woot be my wife?'</L>
<L>A blush, and yes, was Betty's answer.</L>
<L>What d'ye think of my miller's daughter?</L>

<LG>
<L>Two youths for my love are contending in vain;</L>
<L>For, do all they can,</L>
<L>Their sufferings I rally, and laugh at their pain:</L>
<L>Which, which is the man</L>
<L>That deserves me the most? Let me ask of my heart,</L>
<L>Is it Robin, who smirks, and who dresses so smart?</L>
<L>Or Tom, honest Tom, who makes plainness his plan?</L>
<L>Which, which is the man?</L>
</LG>
<LG N="2">
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<L>Indeed, to be prudent, and do what I ought,</L>
<L>I do what I can:—</L>
<L>Yet surely pappa and mamma are in fault;</L>
<L>To a different man</L>
<L>They, each, have advis'd me to yield up my heart:</L>
<L>Mamma praises Robin, who dresses so smart;</L>
<L>Pappa honest Tom, who makes plainness his plan:</L>
<L>Which, which is the man?</L>
</LG>
<LG N="3">

<L>Be kind then, my heart, and but point out the youth,</L>
<L>I'll do what I can</L>

<L>Which, which is the man?</L>
<L>Be kind to my wishes, and point out, my heart,</L>

<L>AND did you not hear of a jolly young waterman,</L>
<L>Who at Black-friar's bridge used for to ply;</L>
<L>And he feather'd his oars with such skill and dexterity,</L>
<L>Winning each heart, and delighting each eye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He look'd so neat, and he row'd so steadily,</L>
<L>The maidens all flock'd in his boat so readily,</L>
<L>And he eyed the young rogues with so charming an air,</L>

<L>In a party to Ranelagh went, or Vauxhall.</L>

<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="19"/>
<L>And oftentimes would they be giggling and leering,</L>

<LG>
<L>And yet, but to see how strangely things happen,</L>
<L>As he row'd along thinking of nothing at all,</L>
<L>He was ply'd by a damsel so lovely and charming,</L>
<L>That she smil'd and so straightway in love he did fall.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And would this young damsel but banish his sorrow,</L>
<L>He'd wed her to-night before to-morrow:</L>
