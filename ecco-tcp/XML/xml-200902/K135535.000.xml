<P>By so doing, I not only gratify the private sentiments of respect, which I feel for your charac∣ter and talents, but I render justice also to the superior excellence of the Poetry itself; for those Productions will necessarily be allowed to possess intrinsic merit, and to deserve their fame, which have received the sanction of the best Critic, the first Scholar, and the most admired Genius of the Age.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE reputation of the following <HI>POEMS</HI> is so well established, that it would be useless to say more of them at present, than what may be necessary to gratify future curiosity. It is there∣fore sufficient to observe, that through the medium of a <HI>DAILY PRINT,</HI> they were first presented to the Public, and obtained that general notice, to which they are so eminently, and so justly en∣titled.</P>
<P>It ought, however, to be recorded, of the cele∣brated correspondence between <HI>DELLA CRUSCA</HI> and <HI>ANNA MATILDA,</HI> that <HI>its genuine enthu∣siasm</HI> arose entirely from poetical Sympathy; for till immediately before the publication of The <HI>In∣terview,</HI> they were totally unacquainted with each other, and reciprocally unknown.</P>

<LG>
<L>Go, idle Boy! I quit thy pow'r;</L>
<L>Thy couch of many a thorn and flow'r;</L>
<L>Thy twanging bow, thine arrow keen,</L>
<L>Deceitful Beauty's timid mien;</L>
<L>The feign'd surprize, the roguish leer,</L>
<L>The tender smile, the thrilling tear,</L>
<L>Have now no pangs, no joys for me,</L>
<L>So fare thee well, for I am free!</L>
<L>Then flutter hence on wanton wing,</L>
<L>Or lave thee in yon lucid spring,</L>
<L>Or take thy bev'rage from the rose,</L>
<L>Or on <HI>Louisa's</HI> breast repose:</L>
<L>I wish thee well for pleasures past,</L>
<L>Yet bless the hour, I'm free at last.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But sure, methinks, the alter'd day</L>
<L>Scatters around a mournful ray;</L>
<L>And chilling ev'ry zephyr blows,</L>
<L>And ev'ry stream untuneful flows;</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="7"/>
No rapture swells the linnet's voice,</L>
<L>No more the vocal groves rejoice;</L>
<L>And e'en thy song, <HI>sweet Bird of Eve!</HI></L>
<L>With whom I lov'd so oft to grieve,</L>
<L>Now scarce regarded meets my ear,</L>
<L>Unanswer'd by a sigh or tear.</L>
<L>No more with devious step I choose</L>
<L>To brush the mountain's morning dews;</L>
<L>"To drink the spirit of the breeze,"</L>
<L>Or wander midst o'er-arching trees;</L>
<L>Or woo with undisturb'd delight,</L>
<L>The pale-cheek'd Virgin of the Night,</L>
<L>That piercing thro' the leafy bow'r,</L>
<L>Throws on the ground a silv'ry show'r.</L>
<L>Alas! is all this boasted ease</L>
<L>To lose each warm desire to please,</L>
<L>No sweet solicitude to know,</L>
<L>For others' bliss, for others' woe,</L>
<L>A frozen apathy to find,</L>
<L>A sad vacuity of mind?</L>
<L>O hasten back, then, heavenly Boy,</L>
<L>And with thine anguish bring thy joy!</L>
<L>Return with all thy torments here,</L>
<L>And let me hope, and doubt, and fear.</L>
<L>O rend my heart with ev'ry pain!</L>
<L>But let me, let me love again.</L>

<L>O! SEIZE again thy golden quill,</L>
<L>And with its point my bosom thrill;</L>
<L>With magic touch explore my heart,</L>
<L>And bid the tear of passion start.</L>
<L>Thy golden quill APOLLO gave—</L>
<L>Drench'd first in bright Aonia's wave:</L>
<L>He Snatch'd it flutt'ring thro' the sky,</L>
<L>Borne on the vapour of a sigh;</L>
<L>It fell from <HI>Cupid's</HI> burnish'd wing</L>
<L>As forcefully he drew the string;</L>
<L>Which sent his keenest, surest dart</L>
<L>Thro' a rebellious frozen heart;</L>
<L>That had till then defy'd his pow'r,</L>
<L>And vacant beat thro' each dull hour.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Be worthy then the sacred loan;</L>
<L>Seated on Fancy's air-built throne;</L>
<L>Immerse it in her rainbow hues,</L>
<L>Nor, what the Godheads bid, refuse.</L>

APOLLO, CUPID, shall inspire,</L>

<L>I KNOW thee well, enchanting Maid,</L>
<L>I've mark'd thee in the silent glade,</L>
<L>I've seen thee on the mountain's height,</L>
<L>I've met thee in the storms of night;</L>
<L>I've view'd thee on the wild beach run</L>

<L>Then stop aghast, his ray no more,</L>
<L>To hear th' impetuous surge's roar.</L>
<L>Hast thou not stood with rapt'ious eye</L>
<L>To trace the stary worlds on high,</L>
<L>T' observe the moon's weak crescent throw</L>
<L>O'er hills, and woods, a glimm'ring glow:</L>
<L>Or, all beside some wizard stream,</L>
<L>To watch its undulating beam?</L>
</LG>

Thou, thou unlike the summer crew</L>

<L>From thee I learnt, 'twas vain to scan</L>
<L>The low ingratitude of Man;</L>
<L>Thou bad'st me Fancy's wilds to rove,</L>
<L>And seek th' extatic bow'r of Love.</L>
<L>When on his couch I threw me down,</L>
<L>I saw thee weave a myrtle crown,</L>
<L>And blend it with the shining hair</L>
<L>Of <HI>her</HI> the Fairest of the Fair.</L>
<L>For this, may ev'ry wand'ring gale</L>
<L>The essence of the rose exhale.</L>
<L>And pour the fragrance on thy breast,</L>
<L>And gently fan thy charms to rest.</L>
<L>Soon as the purple slumbers sly</L>
<L>The op'ning radiance of thine eye,</L>
<L>Strike, strike again the magic lyre,</L>
<L>With all thy pathos, all thy fire;</L>
<L>With all that sweetly-warbled grace,</L>
<L>Which proves thee of celestial race.</L>
<L>O then, in varying colours drest,</L>
<L>And living glory stand confest,</L>
<L>Shake from thy locks ambrosial dew,</L>
<L>And thrill each pulse of joy a-new;</L>
<L>With glowing ardours rouse my soul,</L>
<L>And bid the tides of Passion roll.</L>

<L>CHILL blows the blast, and Twilight's dewy hand</L>
<L>Draws in the West her dusky veil away;</L>
<L>A deeper shadow steals along the land,</L>

<L>Near this bleak Waste no friendly mansion rears</L>

<L>ON the sea-shore with folded arms I stood,</L>

<L>Yet flow'd no bitter anguish from mine eye,</L>
<L>A while remembrance left my wayward state;</L>

<L>Her only solace was to roam</L>

<L>But when bright Peace her silver flute</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>On her soft pillow soon reclin'd,</L>

<L>There, stretch'd upon the racking wheel,</L>

<LG>
<L>Sister! the writhing <HI>Gusman</HI> said—</L>
<L>Oh, Sister! plead—then swoon'd with pain!</L>
<L>On his gash'd bosom sunk his head,</L>
<L>His limbs convuls'd, the cords still strain.</L>

<L>Vain is all art, for life no more</L>

<L>NOW thriving peace scatters her lib'ral stores</L>
<L>O'er happy Lombardy; the Peasant now</L>
<L>May careless carol to the morning breeze,</L>
<L>As on he drives his ploughshare's patient toil,</L>
<L>Nor dread the rapine, nor the rage of war.</L>
<L>Returning Autumn shall not force the sigh</L>
<L>From his torn breast, nor leave him to deplore</L>
<L>His ruin'd olives, and his rifled vines.</L>
<L>No more, Alberto! we demand thy aid</L>
<L>To lead our valiant troops to victory;</L>

My maiden weakness; it is thou must curb</L>
<L>The womanish spirit in me, teach me how</L>
<L>To govern wisely, steadily, and justly:</L>
<L>Consult the people's good, and rule in mercy.</L>
<L>So shall we be in fact two sovereigns,</L>
<L>The real thou, and I th' ostensible.</L>

<SPEAKER>Alb.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Twere better, gen'rous sister! thou should'st choose</L>
<L>Some youthful prince of honour, and renown,</L>
<L>To share the splendid toil of government,</L>
<L>And be thy wedded friend than stoop to me,</L>
<L>A heedless soldier, hot, impolitic;</L>
<L>O rather think of Naples' royal heir,</L>
<L>Illustrious Carlo! let your charms reward</L>
<L>His well-prov'd valour, for in him unites</L>
<L>All that is noble, worthy and engaging;</L>
<L>Then is it just and proper he receive</L>
<L>All that is virtuous, lovely, and benign.</L>
<L>Perchance, his last year's residence at Milan</L>
<L>Gave thee occasion to remark him well,</L>

<L>I thank thy kind attention, good Alberto</L>
<L>And feel the pointed merriment; but yet,</L>

<L>Shalt not regret, or splendor, or respect,</L>

<L>And you, the lords and ladies of my court!</L>
<L>Show me how best I may express my love,</L>

<L>To rule and satisfy, for all have views</L>
<L>To aggrandize themselves, while those who fail</L>
<L>In rising to the summit of their aim,</L>
<L>Turn bitt'rest enemies; nay, I fear that most</L>
<L>Hate whom they flatter, and the giddy crowd</L>
<L>Wish for eternal change. Naught can suffice</L>

<L>Oft would our father pour into my ear</L>

<L>Loads me with secret curses, and vile hate,</L>

<L>Long may'st thou reign in glory, royal maid!</L>
<L>And acting from such gen'rous sentiment,</L>
<L>Revive the sad, and suff'ring multitude,</L>

<L>But yet, Clotilda! I could wish to be</L>
<L>Placed in a station not so eminent,</L>
<L>Where all my weakness, and perhaps my faults,</L>
<L>Would neither injure, trouble, nor offend.</L>
<L>Born in some humble cottage, I had known</L>

No wild commotion of exalted care,</L>
<L>But cheerful hied me forth at early morn,</L>
<L>Tho' the bleak north-wind swept the mountain's side;</L>
<L>Or when warm summer sooth'd the vocal grove,</L>
<L>At ruddy eve, my occupation done,</L>
<L>Have jocund danc'd upon the verdant lawn.</L>

<SPEAKER>Alb.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thou would'st have been a charming shep∣herdess,</L>
<L>Driving with flow'ry crook thy whiten'd flock</L>
<L>To crop the wild thyme on the fragrant down,</L>
<L>And list the humming bell, that seems to shake</L>
<L>The distant dome, and with sad-ling'ring note</L>
<L>Pants on the dying gale. Young Carlo, too,</L>
<L>Sould have been there, a gentle, rural swain,</L>
<L>To take his plaintive pipe, and fondly pour</L>
<L>The song of suff'rance, to subdue thy heart;</L>
<L>Or have been seen at infant dawn's first gleam,</L>
<L>Carving thy name upon the polish'd beach,</L>
<L>The boast, the wonder of the rustic race,</L>
<L>For comeliness, and manly strength, and song.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ther.</SPEAKER>
<L>Nor would it have displeas'd me, for truly</L>
<L>I think there does not live a nobler youth.</L>
<L>His actions vaunt, and not his tongue, of glory.</L>
<L>Gen'rous as love, and stranger to offence,</L>
<L>He wins each heart, nor proudly e'er pretends</L>
<L>To gain by mimic affability:</L>
<L>The common error of our princely tribe!</L>

Unmatch'd in virtue, sense, and dignity,</L>

<L>If aught that's mortal can approach perfection,</L>
<L>'Tis Carlo—and I do not blush to own it.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alb.</SPEAKER>
<L>This honest frankness well becomes thee, sister!</L>

<L>Than all the tricks of timid bashfulness.</L>
<L>I much rejoice that he will soon be here,</L>

<L>Thou seem'st absorb'd in anxious thought, Clotilda.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clot.</SPEAKER>
<L>I have at times a wand'ring mind, and oft</L>
<L>Imagination, with her fairy train,</L>
<L>Leads me to fountains, or enamell'd meads,</L>
<L>To cull an humble garland of fresh flow'rs.</L>
<L>Or, on the promontory's h eight, I seem</L>
<L>To wander, at the midnight hour, and catch</L>
<L>The thrilling sounds of the far distant wreck.</L>
<L>The voice of coming war, with sudden burst,</L>
<L>Perhaps then strikes my ear: Anon, I view</L>
<L>The ransack'd town, the agonizing band</L>
<L>Of hapless females with dishevell'd locks,</L>
<L>Piercing the air with cries; and then, methinks,</L>
<L>I am a queen, and hush their clam'rous fears,</L>
<L>Change desp'rate terror into rapt'rous joy,</L>
<L>And govern with a prosp'rous moderation.</L>
<L>When thus my mind's bewilder'd, I remain</L>
<L>Lively, or sad, or fix'd in solemn thought,</L>
<L>As the wild-woven visions interest.</L>

<L>IS it, alas!</L>
<L>The penalty and sad concomitant of guilt,</L>
<L>That time for ever now must labour on,</L>
<L>With secret workings of unbosom'd pain?</L>
<L>Ah, no! the tyrant conscience soon throws by</L>
<L>His blunted shafts, and reason laughs to scorn</L>
<L>Each servile fear.—He said it should be done</L>
<L>Ere light appear'd, nor is the day yet broke</L>

<L>Their early murmurings; Milan's late-throng'd streets</L>
<L>Seem like some lonely cloister's pensive aisles.</L>
<L>Perhaps th' attempt has fail'd, then dark despair</L>
<L>And shame must fall upon me; and my son</L>
<L>Bow the base knee to his own father's daughter,</L>
<L>Because her birth was fanction'd by the priest,</L>

<L>O grant me pardon, mother, at this hour!—</L>
<L>What means that star, the look of wild dismay,</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clot.</SPEAKER>
<L>Be not surprised,</L>
<L>For often when the night-flies break my rest,</L>
<L>Or shrill winds whistle, or the cricket cries,</L>
<L>I quit an irksome bed, and to and fro</L>
<L>Traverse my room till day-light, fancy then</L>
<L>Teems with wild thought, and each slight noise alarms me.</L>
<L>But, say, my son! at this unsual hour,</L>
<L>Why dost thou seek me?—for tho' always joy</L>
<L>Attends thy presence, now 'tis mix'd with wonder.</L>

<L>After you left the table, for awhile</L>
<L>Theresa staid, being in a merry mood;</L>
<L>And by her gay discourse, and artless wit,</L>
<L>Won ev'ry hearer's love; the old she charm'd,</L>
<L>Pointing her mirthful satire at the vain,</L>
<L>The foplings of her court; while they themselves,</L>
<L>For some were present, laugh'd with willing heart,</L>
<L>To find their foibles drolly singular;</L>
<L>For in her ridicule was no disgrace.</L>
<L><PB N="132" REF="138"/>
The spacious hall, with echo of her praise</L>
<L>Resounded; when I, with voice prophetic,</L>
<L>Cried, to retort her humour, gentle sister!</L>
<L>Would princely Carlo, were but here to tame thee!</L>

<L>Attend the sequel,—scarce had she retired,</L>
<L>When thro' the palace arch, with rattling hoof,</L>
<L>A swift steed brings the wish'd-for messenger;</L>
<L>For 'twas with news of Carlo that he came.</L>
<L>By this, the prince is near, for day and night</L>
<L>He has pursued his journey, like a lover</L>
<L>Warm and sincere, and worthy of Theresa.</L>
<L>These tidings pleased me so, I would not sleep,</L>
<L>But rather chose with watchful readiness,</L>
<L>To wait the coming of my friend, my brother.</L>

<L>This is thy cruel sport, young Carlo comes</L>
<L>Flush'd with the mingled, pleasing expectation,</L>
<L>To wed Theresa, and to reign in Milan.</L>
<L>But he shall find her in the arms of Death;</L>

<L>'Twas three hours after midnight, as thou know'st,</L>

<L>The private stairs I mounted to her chamber.</L>

<L>Peace, listen, and obey,—accept this cup,</L>
<L>Thy brother's mother sends it. Here she scream'd,</L>
<L>Then with uplifted dagger I pursued;</L>
<L>Shriek not, Theresa—or within thy heart</L>
<L>This steel shall rankle; since thou needs must die,</L>
<L>Drain the calm cup, and die without a pain.</L>
</SP>

<L>And so she drank it?</L>

<L>After a show'r of tears, and many prayers,</L>

<L>When sense renew'd the consciousness of crime,</L>
<L>I with a coward's agitated step,</L>
<L>Quitted the murder'd lovliness of virtue,</L>

<L>Your royal sister,—her he loves sincere,</L>

<L>Since last he left her; yet he oft will talk</L>
<L>Of ages past in absence. The gay court</L>

<P>Since the Printing of the first Edition of these Works, the Correspondence between DELLA CRUSCA and ANNA MATILDA has been renewed;—THE EDITOR, therefore, thinks it proper to continue their respective Writings up to the present time; as also to insert the beauti∣ful Poems by LAURA, and the one she called forth from LEONARDO, &amp;c. These latter Additions are necessary, on account of the sub∣sequent allusions to them, and because the lines signed LEONARDO appear to have been pro∣duced by the pen of DELLA CRUSCA.</P>

<L>Heedless I trod the sportive banks of RHONE,</L>

<L>As the first drop my pity shed,</L>
<L>I started as if thou wert dead!</L>

<HEAD>TO LAURA.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>LAURA! I heard thy warbled woes,</L>
<L>At fading Twilight's solemn close:</L>
<L>They met me in yon dreary vale,</L>
<L>Just as the Ringdove ceas'd her tale.</L>
<L>A tale like thine, which seem'd to speak,</L>
<L>That soon her wounded heart would break!</L>
<L>Was it, perhaps, she sought the grove,</L>
<L>In lone solicitude of Love?</L>
<L>Was it, like thee, a faithless mate</L>
<L>She mourn'd too sadly, and too late?</L>
<L>Surely it was—for with the note</L>
<L>I found such melting anguish float,</L>
<L>That watry vapours dimm'd my eye,</L>
<L>And ALL MY SOUL WAS SYMPATHY.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor wonder that I so was mov'd.</L>
<L>For I have suffer'd I have lov'd,</L>
<L>Have felt the truest passion burn,</L>
<L>Have known th' ecstatic blest return,</L>
<L>Have watch'd the look of languor cast,</L>
<L>To shew the rig'rous hour was past:</L>
<L><PB N="292" REF="302"/>
Then have I press'd the blushing Fair,</L>
<L>With pangs—how diff'rent from despair!</L>
<L>Yet was the bliss so pure, so chaste,</L>
<L>That Seraphs might the rapture taste.</L>
<L>Alas! the joy was doom'd to fade,</L>
<L>Like Day's proud flush in Evening shade—</L>
<L>The EYE, so settled once, would range—</L>
<L>The long-fix'd HEART began to change!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah! then, I thought with thee—to try</L>
<L>The only refuge left—and fly.</L>
<L>On many a foreign shore to roam,</L>
<L>And leave my rending cares at home.</L>
<L>Yes, I have trod the ALPINE steep,</L>
<L>By rushing PO have stopp'd to weep;</L>
<L>On the loud DANUBE's banks have stood,</L>
<L>And Eastward cross'd the CASPIAN flood.</L>
<L>'Tis but ILLUSION;—yet remains</L>
<L>Unfaded memory of pains,</L>
<L>The circle wid'ning for relief,</L>
<L>Has still the central point of grief!</L>
<L>Then from th' alluring thought recoil—</L>
<L>'Tis desolating fruitless toil!</L>
<L>But most avoid ITALIA's coast,</L>
<L>Where ev'ry sentiment is lost,</L>
<L>Where TREACH'RY reigns, and base DIS∣GUISE,</L>
<L>And MURDER—looking to the Skies,</L>
<L><PB N="293" REF="303"/>
While sordid SELFISHNESS appears</L>
<L>In low redundancy of scars.</L>
<L>O! what can MUSIC's voice bestow,</L>
<L>Or SCULPTUR'D GRACE, or TITIAN GLOW,</L>
<L>To recompense the feeling mind</L>
<L>For British virtues left behind?</L>
<L><HI>Here</HI> rather <HI>here,</HI> thy ills confound,</L>
<L>To list the billows roar around,</L>
<L>To see the misty Phantoms glide,</L>
<L>On the choak'd river's willowy side,</L>
<L>When the YOUNG MOON aspires to stream</L>
<L>Her scanty Crescent's feeblest beam.</L>
<L>Then, wistful mark the drenching show'rs</L>
<L>That foil gav Summer's fairest flow'rs;</L>
<L>Scorn the fierce storm, the season dare,</L>
<L>And learn to TRIUMPH, or to BEAR!</L>
<L>But if thy sorrow soften'd heart</L>
<L>In vain resists the venom'd dart,</L>
<L>With mine thy deep afflictions blend,</L>
<L>And for a LOVER LOST, receive a FRIEND.</L>

Canst thou, SO KEEN OF FEELING! urge my fate</L>
<L>And bid me mourn thee, yes, and MOURN TOO LATE?</L>
<L>O rash severe decree! my madd'ning brain</L>
<L>Cannot the pond'rous agony sustain,</L>
<L>But forth I rush, as varying Frenzy leads,</L>
<L>To cavern'd lakes, or to the diamond meads,</L>

<L>From scenes like these, to th' neglected Urn</L>

<LG>
<L>AMBIGUOUS NATURE form'd the <HI>female heart</HI></L>
<L>So proud, capricious, cold and warm,</L>
<L>That much she fear'd her FIRST COMMAND</L>
<L><HI>Inert</HI> would prove, throughout the land;</L>
<L>So gave the counteracting charm—</L>
<L>On <HI>favour'd Man</HI> bestow'd sagacious ART.</L>
<L>Thus whilst my keen resentment flow'd,</L>
<L>Thy Vow upon my bosom glow'd;</L>
<L>Sage anger instant took her flight,</L>
<L>And from <HI>thy muse</HI> a joy so bright</L>
<L>Dissus'd itself through all my veins,</L>
<L>That hanging o'er thy charming strains,</L>
<L>My lips spontaneously unclose,</L>
<L>And thus the <HI>proud petition</HI> rose:—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"O! MONARCH of the Heaven-given lyre!</L>
<L>Thou, who the <HI>Theban Peasant</HI> didst inspire</L>
<L>With radiant knowledge, and poetic taste,</L>
<L>To spread thy numbers o'er the flinty waste—</L>
<L>In my yet darker mind thy beam infuse,</L>
<L>And let me feel the high-inspiring muse:</L>
<L><PB N="309" REF="319"/>
Give me one spark of DELLA CRUSCA's light,</L>
<L>Teach me like him to <HI>think</HI>—to paint—to write!</L>
<L>Pour on my pen his rich abounding lay,</L>
<L>Which EARTH and HEAVEN sublimely can display.</L>
<L>Mark! how his varying touch makes ever new</L>
<L>Objects grown flat, on long accustom'd view;—</L>
<L>E'en TRUTH itself his pencil can command—</L>

<L>Thus as I pray'd, unwelcome slumbers came,</L>
<L>But lively, wakeful thought remain'd the same—</L>
<L>And to APOLLO's <HI>Temple</HI> led my feet,</L>
<L>The same ambitious wishes to repeat.</L>
<L>With downcast eyes I near the Altar kneel,</L>
<L>And sacred fervours on my bosom steal;</L>
<L>My folded hair devoutly I unbound,</L>
<L>And dash'd my once-proud laurels on the ground.</L>
<L>My robes, more white than the soft down which flies</L>
<L>O'er <HI>thistled deserts,</HI> thro' autumnal skies,</L>

<L>Again I utter forth my fond desire,</L>
<L>But 'midst the incense my proud hopes expire.</L>

<L><HI>Or 'mongst the od'rous wild-thyme sought repose,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Or soar'd aloft and seiz'd the hov'ring strain.</HI></L>

<L>Was born for anguish, and was form'd for hate,</L>
<L>With such transcendent woe will breathe my sigh,</L>
<L>That envying fiends shall think it ECSTACY,</L>
<L>And with fierce taunts my cherish'd griefs invade,</L>
<L>Till on my pow'rless tongue the last "MATILDA" fade.</L>

<HEAD>TO PHILANDER,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Poem was, in the former Editions, addressed to DELLA CRUSCA.</NOTE> Who said, "WHEN I AM DEAD, WRITE MY ELEGY"</HEAD>

<L>YES, I would write; the sad command</L>
<L>Lives in each melancholy throb</L>
<L>Which lifts my heart. Thy ANNA's hand,</L>
<L>When death that melting eye shall rob</L>
<L>Of the blue flames which flashing there,</L>
<L>Thy burning soul so well declare—</L>
<L>Thy ANNA's hand that soul shall then disclose,</L>
<L>And by indulging, charm her weary woes.</L>
</LG>

<L>Forth would I rush, whilst Night's dim orb</L>
<L>The blackest vapours of the sky absorb;</L>
<L>And should a lingering Star with glittering beam,</L>
<L>Send thro' the air its silvery stream,</L>
<L><PB N="320" REF="330"/>
I'd tell it that PHILANDER WAS NO MORE—</L>
<L>Strait would its glittering beam be sad;</L>
<L>And the wide heavens in darkness clad</L>
<L>Would join to mourn, WHOM <HI>I</HI> should then deplore.</L>
<L>Quick to the cypress forest I would hie,</L>
<L>Whose thick gloom never drank the healthful sky,</L>
<L>And from its deepest central spot,</L>
<L>Where misery had rais'd her flinty grot,</L>
<L>A bough I'd tear;</L>
<L>Whilst shrieking thro' the ebon air</L>
<L>The Night Bird's voice would dismal echo wake,</L>
<L>And with its lorn complaints the resting vallies shake.</L>
<L>Then would I find where yew-trees wave,</L>
<L>O'er some unhappy Lover's grave,</L>
<L>Their desolated shade;</L>
<L>And from their baleful branches brush</L>
<L>The pois'nous dews!—or madly crush</L>
<L>The juices from the riven rind</L>
<L>That ne'er again the naked trunk should bind.</L>
<L>My chosen cypress reed I'd then immerse,</L>
<L>And calling on the Muse of melancholy verse,</L>
<L>With the YEW'S TEARS I'd story all my woe,</L>
<L>Nor should a mingling TEAR of MINE presume to flow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No! I would scorn to weep. The glorious grief</L>
<L>Should gorge upon my heart, and spurn relief.</L>
<L><PB N="321" REF="331"/>
<HI>How</HI> I would write of dear PHILANDER dead!</L>
<L>O! I would weave such verse, that round my hea!</L>
<L>The Demons of the Night,</L>
<L>Arrested in their wheeling slight,</L>
<L>Should learn to pity and to mourn,</L>
<L>And curse their <HI>bounded</HI> pow'r,</L>
<L>Which would not let them say RETURN! RETURN!</L>
<L>I'd paint his form, and every varying grace</L>
<L>Impress'd by FEELING on his manly face,</L>
<L>Then should forever live his SAPPHIRE EYE,</L>
<L>And tho' his sensate heart in earth dissolves,</L>
<L>As Time, obliterating, round revolves,</L>
<L>THAT BEAM at least should never, never die!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But O! how should I paint his mind,</L>
<L>A taste so true, and so refin'd!</L>
<L>How should I speak of his IMMORTAL MUSE</L>
<L>That now can such delight diffuse?</L>
<L>A Muse which <HI>forms</HI> a NATION'S TASTE!</L>
<L>And o'er the weedy waste</L>
<L>Of long-neglected Poetry had thrown</L>
<L>A vivid light, which so sublimely shone.</L>
<L>That to its source ten thousand poets flew,</L>
<L>And form'd their songs, and tun'd their harps anew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But yes! e'en of HIS MUSE I'd speak;</L>
<L>And tho' I know the swelling theme</L>
<L>Would shake my soul, till in th' extreme</L>
<L>Of strong sensation every nerve would break;</L>
<L><PB N="322" REF="332"/>
Yet having then fulfil'd my task,</L>
<L><HI>Done,</HI> what <HI>last night</HI>'s soft shadows heard him ask,</L>
<L>What could I next but die?</L>
<L>Yes, I would court HIM <HI>vainly fam'd</HI></L>
<L>THE KING OF TERRORS! Oh, how <HI>lightly</HI> nam'd!</L>
<L>Would he not be my bosom's friend?</L>
<L>Would not the sighs his agonies would rend</L>
<L>From my torn heart, be passports bright</L>
<L>To wing me to the fields of living light;</L>
<L>Where, from the rapt seraphic throng</L>
<L><HI>My own</HI> PHILANDER's powerful song</L>
<L>Would be the first to seize my ear,</L>
<L>And make me feel that HEAVEN WAS NEAR?</L>
<L>Come then, <HI>pale King!</HI> feed on my feeble breath;</L>
<L>O! come, thou stay'st too long—too long EN∣CHANTING DEATH.</L>

<HEAD>TO A—E B—N.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THINK not, TRANSCENDENT MAID! my woe</L>
<L>Shall ever trouble thy repose;</L>
<L>The mind no lasting pang can know,</L>
<L>Which lets the tongue that pang disclose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sorrow is <HI>sacred</HI> when 'tis <HI>true,</HI></L>
<L>In deep concealment proudly dwells,</L>
<L>And seems its passion to subdue,</L>
<L>When most th' impulsive throb compels.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For HE who dares <HI>assert</HI> his grief,</L>
<L>Who boasts the anguish he may prove,</L>
<L>Obtains, perhaps, the wish'd relief,</L>
<L>BUT O! THE TRAITOR DOES NOT LOVE,</L>
<L>The LOVER is a <HI>Man afraid,</HI></L>
<L>Has neither grace, nor ease, nor art,</L>
<L>Embarras'd, comfortless dimay'd,</L>
<L>He sinks the VICTIM OF HIS HEART.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He feels his own demerits most,</L>
<L>When he should most <HI>aspire</HI> to gain,</L>
<L>And is at length completely <HI>lost,</HI></L>
<L>Because he cannot <HI>urge</HI> his pain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="324" REF="334"/>
<L>But tho' he be so much subdu'd,</L>
<L>And ev'ry scene of spirit leave</L>
<L>As if he mourn'd for all he view'd,</L>
<L>As if he only <HI>liv'd to grieve.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet let his FAIR-ONE's wrongs be told,</L>
<L>Sudden he rushes forth to save,</L>
<L>The Forest's King is not so bold!</L>
<L>O! IF HE LOVES HE MUST BE BRAVE.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And if, alas! her hand should bless</L>
<L>Some more attractive youth than HE;</L>
<L>HE never would adore the less,</L>
<L>But glory in his agony.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He'd see her to the altar led,</L>
<L>And still command his struggling sigh,</L>
<L>Nor would he let one tear be shed,</L>
<L>He'd triumph then;—FOR THEN HE'D DIE.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A FURIOUS modern SATIRIST, who cannot in any manner moderate his rage at the success which Mr. MERRY's poetry has met with, under the signature of DELLA CRUSCA, falls soul on him in DESPERATION, and ACTUALLY charges him with the HEINOUS OFFENCE of POETICAL INCONSTANCY, for having addressed LOVE-VERSES to a VARIETY of WOMEN. The justice of the accusation cannot <HI>seriously</HI> be denied!! All we can say is, that we hope Mr. MERRY's MUSE will behave with more fidelity in future!</NOTE></L>
