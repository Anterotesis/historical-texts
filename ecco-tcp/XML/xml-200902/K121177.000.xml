<HEAD>To the Right Honourable <HI>CHARLES MONTAGƲE,</HI> One of the Lords of the <HI>TREASURY.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Heartily wish this Play <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as perfect as I intended it, that it might be more worthy your Acceptance; and that my Dedication of it to you, might be more becoming that Ho∣nour and Esteem which I, with every Body, who are so fortunate as to know you, have for you. It had your Countenance when yet unknown; and now it is made publick, it wants your Pro∣tection.</P>
<P>I would not have any Body imagine, that I think <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with∣out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Faults, for I am Conscious of several. I confess I design'd (whatever Vanity or Ambition occasion'd that Design) to have written a true and regular Comedy, but I found it an Undertaking which put me in mind of—<HI>Sudet multum, frustraque laboret au∣sus idem.</HI> And now to make Amends for the Vanity of such a De∣sign, I do confess both the Attempt, and the imperfect Perfor∣mance. Yet I must take the Boldness to say, I have not miscar∣ried in the whole; for the Mechanical part of it is perfect. That I may say with as little Vanity, as a Builder may say he has built a House according to the Model laid down before him; or a Gar∣diner that he has set his Flowers in a Knot of such or such a Fi∣gure. I design'd the Moral first, and to that Moral I invented the Fable, and do not know that I have borrow'd one Hint of it any where. I made the Plot as strong as I could, because it was single, and I made it single, because I would avoid Confusion, and was resolved to preserve the three Unities of the Drama, which I have visibly done to the utmost Severity. This is what I ought not to observe upon my self; but the Ignorance and Malice of the greater Part of the Audience is such, that they would make a Man turn Herald to his own Play, and Blazon every Character. However, Sir, this Discourse is very impertinent to you, whose
<PB REF="3"/>
Judgement much better can discern the Faults, than I can ex∣cuse them; and whose good Nature, like that of a Lover, will find out those hidden Beauties (if there are any such) which it wou'd be great Immodesty for me to discover. I think I don't speak im∣properly when I call you a <HI>Lover</HI> of Poetry; for it is very well known she has been a very kind Mistress to you; she has not de∣ny'd you the last Favour; you have enjoy'd her, and she has been fruitful in a most Beautiful Issue—If I break off abruptly here, I hope every Body will understand that it is to avoid a Commenda∣tion, which, as it is your Due, would be most easie for me to pay, and too troublesome for you to receive.</P>
<P>I have, since the Acting of this Play, harken'd after the Objecti∣ons which have been made to it; for I was Conscious where a true Critick might have put me upon my Defence. I was prepa∣red for their Attack; and am pretty confident I could have vindi∣cated some Parts, and excused others; and where there were any plain Miscarriages, I would most ingenuously have confess'd 'em. But I have not heard any thing said sufficient to provoke an An∣swer. That which looks most like an Objection, does not relate in particular to this Play, but to all or most that ever have been written; and that is Soliloquy. Therefore I will answer it, not only for my own sake, but to save others the Trouble, to whom it may hereafter be Objected.</P>
<P>I grant, that for a Man to Talk to himself, appears absurd and unnatural; and indeed it is so in most Cases; but the Circumstan∣ces which may attend the Occasion, make great Alteration. It of∣tentimes happens to a Man, to have Designs which require him to himself, and in their Nature cannot admit of a Confident. Such, for certain, is all Villany; and other less mischievous Intentions may be very improper to be Communicated to a second Person. In such a Case therefore the Audience must observe, whether the Person upon the Stage takes any notice of them at all, or no. For if he supposes any one to be by, when he talks to himself, it is monstrous and ridiculous to the last degree. Nay, not only in this case, but in any Part of a Play, if there is expressed any know∣ledge of an Audience, it is insufferable. But otherwise, when a Man in Soliloquy reasons with himself, and <HI>Pro</HI>'s and <HI>Con</HI>'s, and weighs all his Designs: We ought not to imagine that this Man either talks to us, or to himself; he is only thinking, and thinking such Matter as were inexcusable Folly in him to speak. But be∣cause we are conceal'd Spectators of the Plot in agitation, and the Poet finds it necessary to let us know the whole Mystery of his
<PB REF="4"/>
Contrivance, he is willing to inform us of this Person's Thoughts; and to that end is forc'd to make use of the expedient of Speech, no other better way being yet invented for the Communication of Thought.</P>
<P>Another very wrong Objection has been made by some who have not taken Leisure to distinguish the Characters. The Hero of the Play, as they are pleas'd to call him, (meaning <HI>Mellefont</HI>) is a Gull, and made a Fool, and cheated. Is every Man a Gull and a Fool that is deceiv'd? At that rate I'm afraid the two Classes of Men, will be reduc'd to one, and the Knaves themselves be at a loss to justifie their Title: But if an Open-hearted honest Man, who has an entire Confidence in one whom he takes to be his Friend, and whom he has oblig'd to be so; and who (to confirm him in his Opinion) in all Appearance, and upon several Trials has been so: If this Man be deceiv'd by the Treachery of the other; must he of necessity commence Fool immediately, only because the other has prov'd a Villam? Ay, but there was Caution given to <HI>Mellefont</HI> in the First Act by his Friend <HI>Careless.</HI> Of what Nature was that Caution? Only to give the Audience some Light into the Character of <HI>Maskwell,</HI> before his Appearance; and not to convince <HI>Mellefont</HI> of his Treachery; for that was more than <HI>Careless</HI> was then able to do: He never knew <HI>Maskwell</HI> guilty of any Villany; he was only a sort of Man which he did not like. As for his su∣specting his Familiarity with my Lady <HI>Touchwood:</HI> Let 'em exa∣mine the Answer that <HI>Mellefont</HI> makes him, and compare it with the Conduct of <HI>Maskwell</HI>'s Character through the Play.</P>
<P>I would beg'em again to look into the Character of <HI>Maskwell</HI> be∣fore they accuse <HI>Mellefont</HI> of Weakness for being deceiv'd by him. For upon summing up the Enquiry into this Objection, it may be found they have mistaken Cunning in one Character, for Folly in another.</P>
<P>But there is one thing, at which I am more concerned than all the false Criticisms that are made upon me; and that is, some of the Ladies are offended. I am heartily sorry for it, for I declare I would ra∣ther disoblige all the Criticks in the World than one of the Fair Sex. They are concerned that I have represented some Women Vicious and Affected: How can I help it? It is the Business of a Comick Poet to paint the Vices and Follies of Human-kind; and there are but two Sexes, Male, and Female, <HI>Men,</HI> and <HI>Women,</HI> which have a Title to Humanity: And if I leave one half of them out, the Work will be imperfect. I should be very glad of an opportunity to make my Compliment to those Ladies who are of∣fended: But they can no more expect it in a Comedy, than to be
<PB REF="5"/>
Tickled by a Surgeon, when he's letting 'em Blood. They who are Virtuous or Discreet, can hardly be offended, for such Cha∣racters as these distinguish <HI>them,</HI> and make their Beauties more shining and observ'd: And they who are of the other kind, may nevertheless pass for such, by seeming not to be displeas'd, or touch'd with the Satire of this <HI>Comedy.</HI> Thus have they also wrongfully accus'd me of doing them a Prejudice, when I have in reality done them a Service.</P>
<P>I have heard there are some who intend to accuse this Play of Smuttiness and Bawdy: But I can hardly believe it, because I took a particular Care to avoid it, and if they find any in it, it is of their own making, for I did not design it to be so understood. But to avoid my saying any Thing upon a Subject, which has been so admirably handled before, and for their better Instruction, I earnestly recommend to their Perusal, the Epistle Dedicatory before the <HI>Plain-Dealer.</HI></P>
<P>You will pardon me, Sir, for the Freedom I take of making Answers to other People, in an Epistle which ought wholly to be sacred to you: But since I intend the Play to be so too, I hope I may take the more Liberty of Justifying it, where it is in the Right.</P>
<P>I must now, Sir, declare to the World, how kind you have been to my Endeavours; for in regard of what was well meant, you have excus'd what was ill perform'd. I beg you would con∣tinue the same Method in your Acceptance of this Dedication. I know no other way of making a Return to that Humanity you shew'd, in protecting an Infant, but by Enrolling it in your Service, now that it is of Age and come into the World. Therefore be pleas'd to accept of this as an Acknowledgement of the Favour you have shewn me, and an Earnest of the real Service and Gratitude of,</P>

<HEAD>To my Dear Friend Mr, <HI>CONGREVE,</HI> On His COMEDY, call'd, The Double-Dealer.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WELL then; the promis'd Hour is come at last;</L>
<L>The present Age of Wit obscures the past:</L>
<L>Strong were our Syres; and as they Fought they Writ,</L>
<L>Conqu'ring with Force of Arms, and Dint of Wit;</L>
<L>Theirs was the Giant Race, before the Flood;</L>
<L>And thus, when <HI>Charles</HI> Return'd, our Empire stood.</L>
<L>Like <HI>Janus</HI> he the stubborn Soil manur'd,</L>
<L>With Rules of Husbandry the Rankness cur'd:</L>
<L>Tam'd us to Manners, when the Stage was rude;</L>
<L>And boistrous <HI>English</HI> Wit, with Art indu'd.</L>
<L>Our Age was cultivated thus at length;</L>
<L>But what we gain'd in Skill, we lost in Strength.</L>
<L>Our Builders were, with Want of Genius, curst;</L>
<L>The Second Temple was not like the First:</L>
<L>'Till You, the best <HI>Vitruvius,</HI> come at length;</L>
<L>Our Beauties equal; but excel our Strength.</L>
<L>Firm <HI>Dorique</HI> Pillars found Your solid Base:</L>
<L>The fair <HI>Corinthian</HI> crowns the higher Space;</L>
<L>Thus all below is Strength, and all above is Grace.</L>
<L>In easie Dialogue is <HI>Fletcher</HI>'s Praise:</L>
<L>He mov'd the Mind, but had no Pow'r to raise.</L>
<L>Great <HI>Johnson</HI> did by Strength of Judgment please:</L>
<L>Yet doubling <HI>Fletcher</HI>'s Force, he wants his Ease.</L>
<L>In diff'ring Tallents both adorn'd their Age;</L>
<L>One for the Study, t' other for the Stage.</L>
<L>But both to <HI>Congreve</HI> justly shall submit,</L>
<L>One match'd in Judgment, both o'er-match'd in Wit.</L>
<L>In Him all Beauties of this Age we see;</L>
<L><HI>Etherege</HI> his Courtship, <HI>Southern</HI>'s Purity;</L>
<L>The Satire, Wit, and Strength of Manly <HI>Witcherly.</HI></L>
<L>All this in blooming Youth you have Atchiev'd;</L>
<L>Now are vour soil'd Contemporaries griev'd;</L>
<L>So much the Sweetness of your Manners move,</L>
<L>We cannot Envy you, because we Love.</L>
<L><HI>Fabius</HI> might ioy in <HI>Scipio,</HI> when he saw</L>
<L><PB REF="7"/>
And join his Suffrage to the Votes of <HI>Rome;</HI></L>
<L>Though he with <HI>Hannibal</HI> was overcome.</L>
<L>Thus old <HI>Romano</HI> bow'd to <HI>Raphael</HI>'s Fame;</L>
<L>And Scholar to the Youth he taught, became.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh that your Brows my Lawrel had sustain'd,</L>
<L>Well had I been Depos'd if You had Reign'd!</L>
<L>The Father had descended for the Son;</L>
<L>For only You are lineal to the Throne.</L>
<L>Thus when the State one <HI>Edward</HI> did depose;</L>
<L>A Greater <HI>Edward</HI> in his Room arose.</L>
<L>But now, not I, but Poetry is curs'd;</L>
<L>For <HI>Tom</HI> the Second reigns like <HI>Tom</HI> the First.</L>
<L>But let'em not mistake my Patron's Part;</L>
<L>Nor call his Charity their own Desert.</L>
<L>Yet this I Prophesie; Thou shalt be seen,</L>
<L>(Tho' with some short Parenthesis between:)</L>
<L>High on the Throne of Wit; and seated there,</L>
<L>Not mine (that's little) but thy Lawrel wear.</L>
<L>Thy first Attempt an early Promise made;</L>
<L>That early Promise this has more than paid.</L>
<L>So bold, yet so judiciously you dare,</L>
<L>That your least Praise, is to be Regular.</L>
<L>Time, Place, and Action, may with Pains be wrought,</L>
<L>But Genius must be born; and never can be taught.</L>
<L>This is Your Portion; this Your Native Store;</L>
<L>Heav'n, that but once was Prodigal before,</L>
<L>To <HI>Shakespeare</HI> gave as much; she cou'd not give him more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Maintain your Post: That's all the Fame you need;</L>
<L>For 'tis impossible you shou'd proceed.</L>
<L>Already I am worn with Cares and Age;</L>
<L>And just abandoning th' Ungrateful Stage:</L>
<L>Unprofitably kept at Heav'ns Expence,</L>
<L>I live a Rent-charge on his Providence:</L>
<L>But You, whom ev'ry Muse and Grace adorn,</L>
<L>Whom I foresee to better Fortune born,</L>
<L>Be kind to my Remains; and oh defend,</L>
<L>Against your Judgment, your departed Friend!</L>
<L>Let not th' insulting Foe my Fame pursue;</L>
<L>But shade those Lawrels which descend to You:</L>
<L>And take for Tribute what these Lines express:</L>
<L>You merit more; nor cou'd my Love do less.</L>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Spoken by Mrs. <HI>Bracegirdle.</HI></BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>MOors have this Way (as Story tells) to know</L>
<L>Whether their Brats are truly got, or no;</L>
<L>Into the Sea the New-born Babe is thrown,</L>
<L>There, as Instinct directs, to Swim, or Drawn.</L>
<L>A Barbarous Device, to try if Spouse</L>
<L>Have kept Religiously her Nuptial Vows.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such are the Trials, Poets make of Plays:</L>
<L>Only they trust to more inconstant Seas;</L>
<L>So, does our Author, this his Child commit</L>
<L>To the Tempestuous Mercy of the Pit,</L>
<L>To know if it be truly born of Wit.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Criticks avaunt; for you are Fish of Prey,</L>
<L>And feed, like Sharks, upon an Infant Play.</L>
<L>Be ev'ry Monster of the Deep away;</L>
<L>Let's have a fair Trial, and a clear Sea.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let Nature work, and do not Damn too soon,</L>
<L>For Life will struggle long, 'ere it sink down:</L>
<L>Let it at least rise Thrice, before it Drown.</L>
<L>Let us consider, had it been our Fate,</L>
<L>Thus hardly to be prov'd Legitimate!</L>
<L>I will not say, we'd all in Danger been,</L>
<L>Were each to suffer for his Mother's Sin:</L>
<L>But by my Troth I cannot avoid thinking,</L>
<L>How nearly some good Men might have 'scap'd Sinking.</L>
<L>But Heav'n be prais'd, this Custom is confin'd</L>
<L>Alone to th' Offspring of the Muses kind:</L>
<L>Our Christian Cuckolds are more bent to Pity;</L>
<L>I know not one <HI>Moor</HI>-Husband in the City.</L>
<L>I th' Good Man's Arms the Chopping Bastard thrives,</L>
<L>For he thinks all his own, that is his Wives.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whatever Fate is for this Play design'd</L>
<L>The Poet's sure he shall some Comfort find:</L>
<L>For if his Muse has play'd him false, the worst</L>
<L>That can befall him, is, to be Divorc'd;</L>
<L>You Husbands Judge, if that, be to be Curs'd.</L>

<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>True; but you shall judge whether I have not Reason to be allarm'd. None besides you, and <HI>Maskwell,</HI> are acquainted with the Secret of my Aunt <HI>Touchwood's</HI> violent Passion for me. Since my first Refusal of her Addresses, she has endeavour'd to do me all ill Offices with my Uncle; yet has manag'd 'em with that Subtilty, that to him they have born the face of Kindness; while her Malice, like a Dark Lanthorn, only shone upon me, where it was directed. Still it gave me less Perplexity to prevent the Success of her Displeasure, than to avoid the Importunities of her Love; and of two Evils, I thought my self favour'd in her Aver∣sion. But whether urg'd by her Despair, and the short Prospect of Time she saw, to accomplish her Designs; whether the Hopes of Revenge, or of her Love, terminated in the View of this my Marriage with <HI>Cynthia,</HI> I know not; but this Morning she sur∣priz'd me in my Bed.—</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>What at first amaz'd me; for I look'd to have seen her in all the Transports of a slighted and revengeful Woman: But when I expected Thunder from her Voice, and Lightning in her Eyes; I saw her melted into Tears, and hush'd into a Sigh. It was long before either of us spoke, Passion had ty'd her Tongue, and Amazement mine.—In short, the Consequence was thus, she omitted nothing that the most violent Love could urge, or ten∣der Words express; which when she saw had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> but still I pleaded Honour and Nearness of Blood <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Storm I fear'd at first: For <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> a Fury, she flew to my Sword, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> her doing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> her self a Mischief: Having <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> her; in a

<P>No Sinking, nor no Danger,—Come, cheer up; why you don't know, that while I Plead for you, your Aunt has given me a retaining Fee;—Nay, I am your greatest Enemy, and she does but Journey-Work under me.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! How's this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mask.</SPEAKER>
<P>What d'ye think of being employ'd in the Execution of all her Plots? Ha, ha, ha, by Heav'n it's true; I have underta∣ken to break the Match, I have undertaken to make your Uncle Disinherit you, to get you turn'd out of Doors; and to—Ha, ha, ha, I can't tell you for Laughing,—Oh she has open'd her Heart to me,—I am to turn you a Grazing, and to—Ha, ha, ha, Marry <HI>Cynthia</HI> my self; there's a Plot for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! O see, I see my rising Sun! Light breaks thro' Clouds upon me, and I shall live in Day—O my <HI>Maskwell!</HI> How shall I thank or praise thee; Thou hast out-witted Woman.—But tell me, how could'st thou thus get into her Confidence?—Ha! How? But was it her Contrivance to persuade my Lady <HI>Plyant</HI> to this evtravagant Belief?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mask.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was, and to tell you the Truth, I encourag'd it for your Diversion: Tho' it made you a little uneasie for the present, yet the Reflection of it must needs be entertaining,—I warrant she was very Violent at first.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha, I, a very Fury; but I was most afraid of her Violence at last,—If you had not come as you did; I don't know what she might have attempted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mask.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha, I know her Temper.—Well, you must know then, that all my Contrivances were but Bubbles; 'till at last I pretended to have been long secretly in Love with <HI>Cynthia;</HI> that did my Business; that convinc'd your Aunt, I might be trust∣ed; since it was as much my Interest as hers to break the Match: Then she thought my Jealousie might qualifie me to assist her in her Revenge. And, in short, in that Belief, told me the Secrets of her Heart. At length we made this Agreement, if I accomplish her Designs (as I told you before) she has ingag'd to put <HI>Cynthia</HI> with all her Fortune into my Power.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is most Gracious in her Favour,—Well, and dear <HI>Jack,</HI> how hast thou Contrived?</P>

<P>I would not have you stay to hear it now; for I don't know, but she may come this Way; I am to meet her anon, after that I'll tell you the whole Matter; be here in this Gallery an Hour hence, by that time I imagine our Consultation may be over.</P>

<P>'Till then, Success will attend me; for when I meet you, I meet the only Obstacle to my Fortune. <HI>Cynthia,</HI> let thy Beauty gild my Crimes; and whatsoever I commit of Treachery or Deceit, shall be imputed to me as a Merit—Treachery, what Trea∣chery? Love cancels all the Bonds of Friendship, and sets Men right upon their first Foundations.</P>
<P>Duty to Kings, Piety to Parents, Gratitude to Benefactors, and Fidelity to Friends, are different and particular Ties: But the Name of Rival cuts 'em all asunder, and is a general Acquit∣tance—Rival is equal, and Love like Death an universal Level∣ler of Mankind. Ha! But is there not such a Thing as Honesty? Yes, and whosoever has it about him, bears an Enemy in his Breast: For your Honest Man, as I take it, is that nice, scrupu∣lous, conscientious Person, who will cheat no Body but himself; such another Coxcomb, as your Wise Man, who is too hard for all the World, and will be made a Fool of by no body, but him∣self: Ha, ha, ha. Well for Wisdom and Honesty, give me Cun∣ning and Hypocrisie; oh, 'tis such a Pleasure, to angle for fair∣fac'd Fools! Then that hungry Gudgeon Credulity, will bite at any thing—Why, let me see, I have the same Face, the same Words and Accents, when I speak what I do think; and when I speak what I do not think—the very same—and dear Dissimulation is the only Art, not to be known from Nature.</P>
<L>Why will Mankind be Fools, and be deceiv'd?</L>
<L>And why are Friends and Lovers Oaths believ'd?</L>
<L>When each, who searches strictly his own Mind,</L>

<P>I don't believe it true; he has better Principles—Pho, 'tis Nonsense.

<P>You censure hardly, my Lord; my Sister's Honour is very well known.</P>

<P>Nay, my Lord, it may be so, and I hope it will be found so: But that will require some time; for in such a Case as this, Demonstration is necessary.</P>

<P>Nay, then you have her; for a Woman's bragging to a Man that she has overcome Temptations, is an Argument that they were weakly offer'd, and a Challenge to him to engage her more irresistably. 'Tis only an inhancing the Price of the Com∣modity, by telling you how many Customers have underbid her.</P>

<SPEAKER>Care.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I don't despair—But still she has a grudging to you—I talk'd to her t'other Night at my Lord <HI>Froth</HI>'s Mas∣querade, when I'm satisfied she knew me, and I had no reason to complain of my Reception; but I find Women are not the same bare-faced and in Masks,—and a Vizor disguises their Incli∣nations as much as their Faces.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis a Mistake, for Women may most properly be said to be unmask'd when they wear Vizors; for that secures them from Blushing, and being out of Countenance, and next to being in the Dark, or alone, they are most truly themselves in a Vizor Mask. Here they come, I'll leave you. Ply her close, and by and by clap a <HI>Billet doux</HI> into her Hand: For a Woman never thinks a Man truly in Love with her, 'till he has been Fool enough to think of her out of her Sight, and to lose so much time as to write to her.</P>

<SPEAKER>Cynt.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Mind gives me it won't—because we are both willing; we each of us strive to reach the Gole, and hinder one another in the Race; I swear it never do's well when the Parties are so agreed—For when People walk Hand in Hand, there's neither overtaking nor meeting: We Hunt in Couples where we both pursue the same Game, but forget one another; and 'tis because we are so near that we don't think of coming together.</P>

<P>If you had not been so assured of your own Conduct I would not—But 'tis but reasonable that since I consent to like a Man without the vile Consideration of Mony, he should give me a very evident Demonstration of his Wit: Therefore let me see you undermine my Lady <HI>Touchwood,</HI> as you boasted, and force her to give her Consent, and then—</P>

Very pretty; it seems then I am conducing to my own Cuckol∣dom; why this is the very traiterous Position of taking up Arms by my Authority, against my Person!

Henceforward let no Man make a Friend that would not be Cuckold: For whomsoever he receives into his Bosom, will find the Way to his Bed, and there return his Caresses with Interest to his Wife. Have I for this been pinion'd Night after Night for three Years past? Have I been swath'd in Blankets 'till I have been even depriv'd of Motion, and render'd uncapable of using the common Benefits of Nature? Have I approach'd the Marriage Bed with Reverence as to a sacred Shrine, and deny'd my self the Enjoyment of lawful Domestick

Pleasures to preserve its Purity, and must I now find it polluted by foreign Iniquity? O my Lady <HI>Plyant,</HI> you were chaste as Ice, but you are melted now, and false as Water.—But Provi∣dence has been constant to me in discovering this Conspiracy; still I am beholden to Providence, if it were not for Providence, sure poor Sir <HI>Paul</HI> thy Heart would break.</P>

<SPEAKER>L. T.</SPEAKER>
<P>You want but Leisure to invent fresh Falshood, and sooth me to a fond Belief of all your Fictions; but I will stab the Lie that's forming in your Heart, and save a Sin, in pity to your Soul.</P>
</SP>

<P>Strike then—Since you will have it so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Ha! A steady Villain to the last!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mask.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, why do you dally with me thus?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thy stubborn Temper shocks me, and you knew it would—By Heav'n, this is Cunning all, and not Courage; no, I know thee well: But thou shalt miss thy Aim.</P>
</SP>

<P>Ha, ha, ha.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! Do you mock my Rage? Then this shall punish your fond, rash Contempt! Again Smile!</P>
<STAGE>[Goes to strike.</STAGE>
<P>And such a Smile as speaks in Ambiguity! Ten thousand Meanings lurk in each Corner of that various Face. O! That they were written in thy Heart, That I, with this, might lay thee open to my Sight! But then 'twill be too late to know—</P>
<P>Thou hast, thou hast found the only way to turn my Rage; Too well thou know'st my jealous Soul cou'd never bear Uncertainty. Speak then, and tell me—Yet are you silent? Oh, I am wilder'd in all Passions! But thus my Anger melts. <STAGE>(Weeps)</STAGE> Here, take this Ponyard, for my very Spirits faint, and I want Strength to hold it, thou hast disarm'd my Soul.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mask.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE> Thanks, my Invention; and now I have it for you.—First tell me what urg'd you to this Violence? For your Passion broke in such imperfect Terms, that yet I am to learn the Cause.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. T.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord himself surpriz'd me with the News, you were to marry <HI>Cynthia</HI>—That you had own'd your Love to him, and his Indulgence would assist you to attain your Ends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER>Mask.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant you in Appearance all is true; I seem'd consent∣ing to my Lord; nay, transported with the Blessing—But could you think that I who had been happy in your lov'd Embra∣ces, could e'er be fond of an inferior Slavery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld. T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! O Poison to my Ears! What do I hear!</P>

<P>Nay, good my Lord, forbear Resentment, let us hear it out.</P>

<P>Yes, I will contain, tho' I cou'd burst.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mask.</SPEAKER>
<P>I that had wanton'd in the wide Circle of your World of Love, cou'd be confin'd within the puny Province of a Girl. No—Yet tho' I dote on each last Favour more than all the rest; though I would give a Limb for every Look you cheap∣ly throw away on any other Object of your Love; yet so far I prize your Pleasures o'er own, that all this seeming Plot that I have laid, has been to gratifie your Taste, and cheat the World, to prove a faithful Rogue to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. T.</SPEAKER>
<P>If this were true—But how can it be?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mask.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have so contriv'd, that <HI>Mellefont</HI> will presently, in the Chaplain's Habit, wait for <HI>Cynthia</HI> in your Dressing-Room: But I have put the Change upon her, that she may be otherwhere em∣ploy'd—Do you procure her Night-Gown, and with your Hoods tyed over your Face, meet him in her stead; you may go privately by the back Stairs, and, unperceiv'd, there you may propose to reinstate him in his Uncle's Favour, if he'll comply with your Desires; his Case is desperate, and I believe he'll yield to any Conditions,—If not, here take this; you may employ it better, than in the Death of one who is nothing when not yours.</P>
<STAGE>[Gives the Dagger.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou can'st deceive every Body,—Nay, thou hast de∣ceiv'd me; but 'tis as I would wish,—Trusty Villain! I could worship thee.—</P>
</SP>

<P>No more,—There wants but a few Minutes of the time; and <HI>Mellefont</HI>'s Love will carry him there before his Hour.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cynt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I dare answer for him.</P>

<P>I do him fresh Wrong to question his Forgiveness; for I know him to be all Goodness,—Yet my Wife! Dam her,—She'll think to meet him in that Dressing-Room,—Was't not so? And <HI>Maskwell</HI> will expect you in the Chaplain's Chamber,—For once, I'll add my Plot too,—let us haste to find out, and inform my Nephew; and do you, quickly as you can, bring all the Company into this Gallery.—I'll expose the Strumpet, and the Villain.</P>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Spoken by Mrs. <HI>Mountford.</HI></BYLINE>
<L>COuld Poets but foresee how Plays would take,</L>
<L>Then they could tell what Epilogues to make;</L>
<L>Whether to thank or blame their Audience most:</L>
<L>But that late Knowledge does much Hazard cost,</L>
<L>'Till Dice are thrown, there's nothing won, nor lost.</L>
<L>So 'till the Thief has stoll'n, he cannot know</L>
<L>Whether he shall escape the Law, or no.</L>
<L>But Poets run much greater Hazards far,</L>
<L>Than they who stand their Trials at the Barr;</L>
<L>The Law provides a Curb for its own Fury,</L>
<L>And suffers Judges to direct the Jury.</L>
<L>But in this Court, what Diff'rence does appear!</L>
<L>For every one's both Judge and Jury here;</L>
<L>Nay, and what's worse, an Executioner.</L>
<L>All have a Right and Title to some Part,</L>
<L>Each chusing that in which he has most Art.</L>
<L>The dreadful Men of Learning all Confound,</L>
<L>Unless the Fable's good, and Moral sound.</L>
<L>The Vizor-Masks, that are in Pit and Gallery,</L>
<L>Approve, or Damn, the Repartee and Rallery.</L>
<L>The Lady Criticks, who are better read,</L>
<L>Enquire if Characters are nicely bred;</L>
<L>If the soft things are penn'd and spoke with Grace:</L>
<L>They Judge of Action too, and Time, and Place;</L>
<L>In which we do not doubt but they're discerning,</L>
<L>For that's a kind of <HI>Assignation Learning.</HI></L>
<L>Beaus judge of Dress; the Witlings judge of Songs;</L>
<L>The Cuckoldom, of Ancient Right, to Cits belongs.</L>
<L>Thus poor Poets, the Favour are deny'd,</L>
<L>Even to make Exceptions, when they're Try'd.</L>
<L>'Tis hard that they must ev'ry one admit;</L>
<L>Methinks I see some Faces in the Pit,</L>
<L>Which must of Consequence be Foes to Wit.</L>
<L>You who can Judge, to Sentence may proceed;</L>
<L>But tho' he cannot Write, let him be freed</L>
<L>At least from their Contempt, who cannot Read.</L>
