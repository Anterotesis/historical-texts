<HEAD>AN EPISTLE TO DAVID GARRICK, Esq.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THANKS to much Industry and Pains,</L>
<L>Much twisting of the Wit and Brains,</L>
<L>Translation has unlock'd the Store,</L>
<L>And spread abroad the <HI>Grecian</HI> Lore,</L>
<L>While <HI>Sophocles</HI> his Scenes are grown,</L>

<L>No more shall Taste presume to speak,</L>
<L>From its Enclosures in the <HI>Greek;</HI></L>
<L>But, all its Fences broken down,</L>
<L>Lie at the Mercy of the Town.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Critic, I hear thy Torrent rage,</L>
<L>"'Tis Blasphemy against that Stage,</L>
<L>"Which <HI>Aeschylus</HI> his Warmth design'd,</L>
<L>"<HI>Euripides</HI> his Taste refin'd,</L>
<L>"And <HI>Sophocles</HI> his last Direction,</L>
<L>"Stamp'd with the Signet of Perfection."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Perfection's but a Word ideal,</L>
<L>And bears about it nothing real,</L>
<L>And Excellence was never hit</L>
<L>In the first Essays of Man's Wit.</L>
<L>Shall <HI>ancient</HI> Worth, or <HI>ancient</HI> Fame</L>
<L>Preclude the Moderns from their Claim?</L>
<L>Must they be Blockheads, Dolts, and Fools,</L>
<L>Who write not up to <HI>Grecian</HI> Rules?</L>
<L>Who tread in Buskins or in Socks</L>
<L>Must they be damn'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="4"/>
Nor Merit of good Works prevail,</L>
<L>Except within the classic Pale?</L>
<L>'Tis Stuff that bears the Name of Knowlege,</L>
<L>Not current half a Mile from College;</L>
<L>Where half their Lectures yield no more</L>
<L>(Besure I speak of Times of yore)</L>
<L>Than just a niggard Light, to mark</L>
<L>How much we all are in the Dark.</L>
<L>As Rushlights in a spacious Room,</L>
<L>Just burn enough to form a Gloom.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When <HI>Shakespeare</HI> leads the Mind a Dance,</L>
<L>From <HI>France</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> hence to <HI>France,</HI></L>
<L>Talk not to me of Time and Place;</L>
<L>I own I'm happy in the Chace.</L>
<L>Whether the Drama's here or there,</L>
<L>'Tis Nature, <HI>Shakespeare,</HI> every where.</L>
<L>The Poet's Fancy can create,</L>
<L>Contract, enlarge, annihilate,</L>
<L>Bring past and present close together,</L>
<L>In spite of Distance, Seas, or Weather.</L>
<L>And shut up in a single Action,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="5"/>
So, Ladies at a Play, or Rout,</L>
<L>Can flirt the Universe about,</L>
<L>Whose geographical Account</L>
<L>Is drawn and pictur'd on the Mount.</L>
<L>Yet, when they please, contract the Plan,</L>
<L>And shut the World up in a Fan.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>True Genius, like <HI>Armida</HI>'s Wand,</L>
<L>Can raise the Spring from barren Land.</L>
<L>While all the Art of Imitation,</L>
<L>Is pilf'ring from the first Creation;</L>
<L>Transplanting Flowers with useless Toil,</L>
<L>Which wither in a foreign Soil.</L>
<L>As Conscience often sets us right,</L>
<L>By its interior active Light,</L>
<L>Without th' Assistance of the Laws</L>
<L>To combat in the moral Cause;</L>
<L>So Genius, of itself discerning,</L>
<L>Without the mystic Rules of Learning,</L>
<L>Can from its present Intuition,</L>
<L>Strike at the truth of Composition.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
<L>Yet those who breath the classic Vein,</L>
<L>Enlisted in the mimic Train,</L>
<L>Who ride their Steed with double Bit,</L>
<L>Not run away with by their Wit,</L>
<L>Delighted with the Pomp of Rules,</L>
<L>The specious Pedantry of Schools;</L>
<L>Which Rules, like Crutches, ne'er became,</L>
<L>Of any Use but to the Lame.</L>
<L>Persue the Method sat before 'em,</L>
<L>Talk much of Order and Decorum.</L>
<L>Of Probability, of Fiction,</L>
<L>Of Manners, Ornament and Diction.</L>
<L>And with a Jargon of hard Names,</L>
<L>A Privilege which Dulness claims,</L>
<L>And merely us'd by way of Fence,</L>
<L>To keep out plain and Common Sense.</L>
<L>Extoll the Wit of antient Days,</L>
<L>The simple Fabric of their Plays,</L>
<L>Then from the Fable, all so chaste,</L>
<L>Trick'd up in modern, antient Taste,</L>
<L>So mighty gentle all the while,</L>

While Chorus, marks the servile Mode</L>
<L>With fine Reflexion, in an Ode,</L>
<L>Present you with a perfect Piece,</L>
<L>Form'd on the Model of old <HI>Greece.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Come, prithee Critic, set before us,</L>
<L>The Use and Office of a Chorus.</L>
<L>What! Silent! Why then, I'll produce,</L>
<L>Its Services from antient Use.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis to be ever on the Stage,</L>
<L>Attendants upon Grief or Rage,</L>
<L>To be an arrant Go-between,</L>
<L>Chief-Mourner, at each dismal Scene.</L>
<L>Shewing its Sorrow, or Delight,</L>
<L>By shifting Dances, left and right.</L>
<L>Not much unlike our modern Notions,</L>
<L>Adagio or Alegro Motions;</L>
<L>To watch upon the deep Distress,</L>
<L>And plaints of Royal Wretchedness;</L>
<L>And when, with Tears, and Execration,</L>
<L>They've pour'd out all their Lamentation,</L>

And with their Hai's and Hee's and Hoe's</L>
<L>To make a Symphony of Woes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Doubtless the Antients want the Art,</L>
<L>To strike at once upon the Heart.</L>
<L>Or why their Prologues of a Mile</L>
<L>In simple—call it—humble Stile,</L>
<L>In unimpassion'd Phrase to say</L>
<L>'Fore the Beginning of this Play,</L>
<L>I hapless <HI>Polydore</HI> was found,</L>
<L>By Fishermen or others drown'd?</L>
<L>Or, I a Gentleman, did wed,</L>
<L>Great <HI>Agamemnon</HI>'s royal Daughter,</L>
<L>Who's coming hither to draw Water?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Or need the Chorus to reveal,</L>
<L>Reflexions which the Audience feel;</L>
<L>And jog them least Attention sink,</L>
<L>To tell them how and what to think?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh, where's the Bard, who at one View,</L>
<L>Cou'd look the whole Creation through,</L>

He scorn'd the Modes of Imitation,</L>
<L>Of Altering, Pilfering, and Traslation,</L>
<L>Nor painted Horror, Grief, or Rage</L>
<L>From Models of a former Age;</L>
<L>The bright Original he took,</L>
<L>And tore the Leaf from Nature's Book.</L>
<L>'Tis <HI>Shakespeare,</HI> thus who stands alone—</L>
<L>Why need I tell what <HI>you</HI> have shown.</L>
<L>How true, how perfect, and how well,</L>
<L>The Feelings of our Hearts must tell.</L>
