<P>THE Capricious Lovers; A COMIC OPERA. As it is performed at the THEATRE ROYAL IN DRURY-LANE.</P>
<P>By Mr. ROBERT LLOYD.</P>
<P>The Music composed by Mr. RUSH. LONDON: Printed for R. WITHY, at the Dunciad in Cornhill; W. GRIFFIN, in Fetter-Lane; Mr. BECKET, in the Strand; and Mr. DAVIES, in Russel-Street, Covent-Garden. 1764. [Price Eighteen-pence.]</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Caprices d' Amour ou Ninette a la Cour,</HI> written by Mr. Favart, is the ground work of the following little piece. But I believe whoever shall examine both Operas, will find that I have been perhaps too wanton in my imitation, and departed too widely from the original. They may probably wish that I had pil∣fered more and written less. What I have added, what I have omitted, or what
<PB N="ii" REF="5"/>
I have alter'd, those who can compare one piece with the other, will easily perceive, and to those who cannot make the com∣parison, any explanation on that head is altogether unnecessary.</P>
<P>When Mr. Favart's comedy was first put into my hands, I could not but be much pleased with the life and simplicity he had thrown into his performance, with∣out descending to that species of humour, which the English have very little relish of, gross Italian buffoonry. This I have chiefly endeavoured to preserve in the following Opera, with what success the Public will determine.</P>

my dear creature, you are most horribly mistaken.

upon him, here he was bowing and scraping and cringing. Why are they so complaisant here, these great folks who terrify and domineer over us in the country? Does the court make them so much better? No, I believe if they do any good here 'tis only to get a right to do something bad elsewhere.</P>
