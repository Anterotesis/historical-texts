<HEAD>TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE PRINCE OF WALES.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU are of an age when the heart opens to the most warm and generous impressions; an age, when all that gives worth and dignity to elevated rank, takes full possession of the bosom. At this bright and unprejudiced crisis of your life, the precepts of Omar and the practice of Hamet, as drawn by Hawkesworth, and dramatised by the author of this tragedy, will win upon your attention; not indeed by the attraction of poetry, but by the natural reverence which unspotted youth ever renders, and with delight, to faithful
<PB N="ii" REF="4"/>representations of wisdom and of virtue; the wisdom of the patriot, the virtue of the prince.</P>
<P>That your Royal Highness may very long reflect blessings on the people of Eng∣land, and prove a distinguished honour to the illustrious family who have that gene∣rous people in charge, is the zealous prayer, as it is the most empassioned expecta∣tion, of</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS's Most devoted, And most dutiful servant, THE AUTHOR.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS tragedy borrows its general story, and some of its incidents, with as much of its sentiment as could be preserved, from the very beautiful <HI>"Almoran</HI> and <HI>Hamet"</HI> of Hawkesworth. Except that truth and justice call for such acknowledgement, it would on any other score have been unnecessary; for what can be added to the fame of a work universally celebrated? The original <HI>machinery</HI> has been rejected, because it would have been too daring an attempt to interweave it with the fable of a modern composition, and perhaps too mighty a task to manage without violating the first great law of dramatick probability. At the same time, it has been the authour's most assiduous endeavour, to "convert the sententious dis∣play of eastern wisdom, as far as character would permit, into the language of passion, varied by every motive which might most forcibly affect the human mind in the most warm and interesting situations." These are the words of a critick, who seems fully to have penetrated the design of the author. The lines with inverted com∣mas were omitted in the representation, to fa∣vour the rapidity of the action. They are re∣tained
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>in the printed copy, not more at the instance of particular friends, than on general experience that those passages which retard the force of the passion on the theatre, are frequently read with most satisfaction in the closet.</P>
<P>The Play still continuing to be received on the stage with the most brilliant success, the author would but half discharge the debt of equity were he to confess obligations to Hawkes∣worth only. The liberal, perhaps the unequalled support which the managers have afforded by the scenery, the interesting manner in which Mr. Linley has set the Epithalamium, the taste of Mr. De Loutherberg, and the splendour which the performers have thrown over the characters by their EXCELLENT representation, demand and receive the most warm and pointed expressions of gratitude. There remains but one tribute of justice more, and <HI>that</HI> is due to Mr. Sheridan, whose attention has, on this occasion, been friendship, and whose assistance must always be fame.</P>

<SP>
<L>WITH trembling steps, as if <HI>suspicious</HI> grown,</L>
<L>Why doth the tragic muse approach her throne?</L>
<L>Her <HI>golden throne,</HI> where once with grace divine,</L>
<L>The goddess sat, <HI>"supreme of all the nine."</HI></L>
<L>Turns her fair palace to the festive bower,</L>
<L>Where jest and sport usurp her nobler power?</L>
<L>Lost is each lovelier feeling that imparts</L>
<L>To <HI>her</HI> the sovereign rule o'er British hearts?</L>
<L>Sunk the pure taste which once secur'd her sway,</L>
<L>Or wanes that virtue which admir'd her lay?</L>
<L>Vain fears! A generous race assembled here,</L>
<L>Still pay to grief compassion's softest tear;</L>
<L>Still pay the heart-felt sigh which Britons owe</L>
<L>To nature's feelings, and to nature's woe.</L>
<L>When jealous fiends <HI>Othello</HI>'s heart-strings tear,</L>
<L>When guilty <HI>Richard</HI> groans with dire despair;</L>
<L>When injur'd <HI>Lear,</HI> with tort'ring anguish wild,</L>
<L>Pours the deep curse on each ungrateful child;</L>
<L>When plaintiff notes speak poor <HI>Ophelia</HI>'s woes,</L>
<L>Or love in <HI>Juliet</HI>'s tender bosom glows;</L>
<L>The glistening eye, the trembling lip proclaim</L>
<L>Nature and virtue here are still the same.</L>
<L>In scepter'd state affliction's soothing strain</L>
<L>Still in YOUR bosoms fix their stedfast reign—</L>
<L>Blest seat of empire! Where th' affections wait,</L>
<L>To shield the mourner from the shocks of fate—</L>
<L>Where the best passions with allegiance fair,</L>
<L>For suff'ring worth the healing balms prepare;</L>
<L>Nor ever shall your hearts such rights forego;</L>
<L>What <HI>social sorrow asks, these hearts shall still bestow!</HI></L>
<L>No longer then oppress'd with anxious fear,</L>
<L>The muse shall REASUME her station <HI>here</HI>—</L>
<L>Shall court each virtue that's a nation's pride,</L>
<L>And gain the nobler passions to her side.—</L>
<L><PB REF="8"/>
If, in the tenour of her pensive lay,</L>
<L>In nature's path, TO NIGHT she holds her way;</L>
<L>If she excites the sympathising mind,</L>
<L>To generous acts, the glory of our kind!</L>
<L>This dread <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To the Pit.</NOTE> tribunal, shall suspend its zeal,</L>
<L>Spurn its proud office, and grow proud to feel:</L>
<L>This radiant <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">To the Boxes.</NOTE> circle too her hopes approve,</L>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>The following prologue, from an honour-giving muse, of which it is truly worthy, did not arrive till after Mr. Bannister was put in possession of the excellent poetry which precedes it; and which another ingenious friend had been sollicited to supply. The author of the tragedy, however, thinks Miss Seward's composition too valuable to circulate only in manuscript. Indeed, to keep such verses out of print, would not only be a private injury to the piece (which they will adorn) but an unpardonable injustice to the public.</HI></P>

<L>SLOW from an ebon throne's majestic height,</L>
<L>A lovely form descends upon my sight!</L>
<L>The floating purple, and the lofty mien</L>
<L>Proclaim <HI>the empress of the tragic scene,</HI></L>
<L>Divine Melpomene!—Aggriev'd she stands,</L>
<L>Her tears fast falling on her folded hands.</L>
<L>The show'ry cloud thus dims the azure skies,</L>
<L>Thus round the moon the misty halos rise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Why, beauteous mourner, ere the hour of woe,</L>
<L>Throb those quick sighs, those crystal sorrows flow?</L>
<L>Thy Fair Circassian yet no griefs molest,</L>
<L>Nor love, nor fear assail her virgin breast!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But soft!—the muse of anguish sadly speaks!</L>
<L>Faint on my ear the murm'ring accent breaks;</L>
<L><PB REF="9"/>
Low hollow gales its mournful sounds convey,</L>
<L>And thus the goddess says—or seems to say:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Can then the tender female bosom prove</L>
<L>"A keener pang than disappointed love?</L>
<L>"Ah me!—For light Thalia <HI>more</HI> than shares</L>
<L>"My darling Sheridan's too partial cares:</L>
<L>"On her vain brows his lavish wreaths are thrown,</L>
<L>"His thousand radiant gems emblaze her zone!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"What tho' she gave to his supreme command</L>
<L>"Each laughing grace that waits her potent wand,</L>
<L>"Yet with sublimer force <HI>my</HI> chemic-fire</L>
<L>"'With proud distinction deck'd his sacred lyre;' <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Parody on a beautiful line in Mr. Sheridan's monody.</NOTE></L>
<L>"To purest gold its warbling wires I turn'd,</L>
<L>"When their sweet lays o'er lifeless Garrick mourn'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"And once he sung in <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See prologue to Semiramis.</NOTE> elevated strain</L>
<L>"My charms superior, and my right to reign;</L>
<L>"Then, with the majesty my impulse throws</L>
<L>"In chasten'd splendor round the poet's brows,</L>
<L>"He bade the tears that stream'd o'er Asia's queen,</L>
<L>"Flow soft in <HI>real</HI> sorrow's lonely scene.—</L>
<L>"But soon he <HI>smil'd</HI> those graceful tears away,</L>
<L>"And faithless own'd my frolic <HI>rival</HI>'s sway.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Perchance, howe'er, the jocund pride of youth</L>
<L>"Alone has warp'd from me his love and truth;</L>
<L>"Ere long the rover may again be mine,</L>
<L>"And with his blooming laurels deck my shrine!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"This night no vulgar hand the meed bestows,</L>
<L>"That now for me in pristine beauty glows.—</L>
<L>"Oh! may the fost'ring breath of public praise</L>
<L>"Preserve from cruel blight the votive bays!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I hear no more—For, with a pensive smile,</L>
<L>Slow glides the muse down yonder winding isle!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>May you, ye brave and wise, ye good and fair,</L>
<L>Fulfil with suffrage kind her fervent pray'r!</L>
<L>And since no force of wit and comic art</L>
<L>Can shut to pity's plaint the British heart,</L>
<L>We hope your just applause may bless our bard,</L>
<L>His first ambition, and his bright reward.</L>

<STAGE>Spoken by Miss FARREN.</STAGE>
<SP>
<LG>
<L>OF late at West minster <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The first night's representation happened on the opening of parliament.</NOTE>, in order due,</L>
<L>A gracious speech first made, debates ensue.</L>
<L>Ere then, in this <HI>full house,</HI> our author's fate</L>
<L>Becomes the subject of your warm debate—</L>
<L>Ere yet you opposition criticks rise</L>
<L>To move for censures, and refuse supplies;</L>
<L>Or partial friends pour down corrupt applause,</L>
<L>By <HI>orders</HI> pension'd in the author's cause,</L>
<L>From either party—none will sure impeach</L>
<L>My sovereign title to pronounce the speech.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thro' me the muse her <HI>loyal subjects</HI> greets—</L>
<L>Tho' I speak standing, and you keep your seats—</L>
<L>Pleas'd that so full a house attends the summons—</L>
<L>Pit—Box—and Gallery—Peers and faithful Commons—</L>
<L>With deep concern she bids me here relate</L>
<L>What dangers threaten the dramatic state—</L>
<L>What hosts of foes her tottering realms invade,</L>
<L>By fashion muster'd, and by folly paid:</L>
<L>While <HI>Taste,</HI> her old ally, unmov'd we see,</L>
<L>And <HI>Spleen</HI> preserves an <HI>arm'd neutrality.</HI></L>
<L>See first come on—all arm'd in whale-bone hoops—</L>
<L>The tuneful leaders of the Italian troops.</L>
<L>Long have they wag'd—too oft with conquest crown'd—</L>
<L>The doubtful conflict betwixt sense and sound.</L>
<L>Allied with these—in hostile bands advance</L>
<L>The light-heel'd legions of invading France.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To point her thunders on our British coast,</L>
<L>Year after year, has been vain Gallia's boast.</L>
<L>Their troops embark—the bold attempt is plann'd—</L>
<L>Their <HI>heroes threaten</HI> — and their <HI>dancers land,</HI>—</L>
<L><HI>These only</HI> put their threats in execution,</L>
<L>And lay all London under contribution.</L>
<L><PB REF="87"/>
Immortal chiefs! who on one leg can do</L>
<L>What yet no warrior has atchiev'd on two.</L>
<L>Like Rome's proud victor, in their fierce attack,</L>
<L>They come, they see, they conquer, and—go back.</L>
<L>And, modern Jasons, as of old in Greece,</L>
<L>Sail home triumphant with the golden fleece.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Before such dangers shall we prostate fall?</L>
<L>Or, like true Britons, boldly brave them all?</L>
<L>If fairly led, we'll bid their host defiance,</L>
<L>Dissolv'd a late <HI>unnatural alliance;</HI></L>
<L>Our leader too shall now assistance lend,</L>
<L>Not promise succours, and delay to send:</L>
<L>But chiefly <HI>here</HI>—our hopes and courage lie</L>
<L>In <HI>you,</HI> our truest friend and best ally—</L>
<L>Support our Bard to-night, and on his part</L>
<L>Receive the <HI>tribute</HI> of a grateful heart—</L>
<L>Thro' me receive, and here again I'll meet ye,</L>
<L>Act as ambassadress, and sign the treaty.</L>
