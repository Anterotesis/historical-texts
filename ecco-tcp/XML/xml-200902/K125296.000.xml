<HEAD>A KING or a CONSUL? A NEW SONG to the Tune of <HI>Derry down.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>COME all ye brave Englishmen, list' to my story,</L>
<L>You who love peace and freedom, and honor and glory!</L>
<L>No foreign usurper they hither shall bring,</L>
<L>We'll be rul'd by a <HI>native,</HI> our Father and King.</L>
<L>Derry down, down, down, derry down!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No Corsican Despot in England shall rule,</L>
<L>No Disciple avow'd of the Mussulman school;</L>
<L>A Papist at Rome, and at Cairo a Turk,</L>
<L>Now this thing, now that thing, as best helps his work.</L>
<L>Derry down,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Shall Atheists rule Britons? O never, no never,</L>
<L>Forbid it Religion for ever and ever;</L>
<L>Their heathenish Consuls then let them not bring,</L>
<L>Our Country is Christian, and Christian our King!</L>
<L>Derry down,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In England when wounds are the sailor's sad lot,</L>
<L>Their wounds and their sufferings are never forgot;</L>
<L>To a Palace far nobler our Vet'rans we bring,</L>
<L>Than is kept for himself by our merciful King.</L>
<L>Derry down,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let any compare, if my saying he blames,</L>
<L>The splendors of Greenwich<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A magnificent Hospital for Sailors.</NOTE> with those of St. James.</L>
<L>—Once <HI>Buoni</HI> trepann'd his poor troops to the East,</L>
<L>O'er deserts too sultry for man or for beast;</L>
<L>Derry down,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When the battle was over, and hundreds were found,</L>
<L>By the fortune of war gash'd with many a wound;</L>
<L>Diseas'd and afflicted—now what do you think</L>
<L>This tender Commander oblig'd them to drink?</L>
<L>Derry down,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>You fancy 'twas grog, or good flip, or good ale;</L>
<L>No, 'twas <HI>poison,</HI> alas! was the soldiers' regale;</L>
<L>See <HI>Jaffa</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Where French Soldiers were <HI>poisoned</HI> in the Hospital.</NOTE>—see <HI>Haslar</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The Royal Portsmouth Hospital where English Sailors are treated like Princes.</NOTE>—the diff'rence to prove,</L>
<L><HI>There</HI> poison, <HI>here</HI> kindness, <HI>there</HI> murder, <HI>here</HI> love.</L>
<L>Derry down,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And lest we should publish his horrible tricks,</L>
<L>With our freedom of printing a quarrel he picks;</L>
<L>But <HI>we</HI> keep no secrets, each newspaper shews it,</L>
<L>And while we act fairly we care not who knows it.</L>
<L>Derry down,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To Frenchmen, O Britons, we never will trust;</L>
<L>Who murder their Monarch can never be just;</L>
<L>That freedom we boast of, the French never saw,</L>
<L>'Tis guarded by order and bounded by law.</L>
<L>Derry down,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That <HI>Buoni</HI>'s invincible, Frenchmen may cry,</L>
<L>Let Sidney the brave give each boaster the lie;</L>
<L>Tho' the arrows of Europe against us are hurl'd,</L>
<L>Be true to yourselves and you'll conquer the world.</L>
<L>Derry down,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tho' some struggles we make, let us never repine,</L>
<L>While we sit underneath our own fig-tree and vine;</L>
<L>Our Fig-tree is Freedom, our Vine is Content,</L>
<L>Two blessings, by nature for Frenchmen not meant.</L>
<L>Derry down,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>French liberty Englishmen never will suit,</L>
<L><HI>They</HI> have planted the tree, but <HI>we</HI> feed on the fruit;</L>
<L>Then rail not at taxes, altho' they cut deep,</L>
<L>'Tis a heavy Insurance to save the brave Ship.</L>
<L>Derry down,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let narrow-soul'd <HI>party</HI> be banish'd the land,</L>
<L>And let Englishmen join with one heart and one hand;</L>
<L>Let each fight for his Wife, for <HI>we</HI> marry but <HI>one,</HI></L>
<L>The French wed so many, they oft care for none.</L>
<L>Derry down,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>One King did not suit them, three Tyrants they chose,</L>
<L>And their God they renounce while their King they depose;</L>
<L>Then we ne'er will submit to the Corsican's rod,</L>
<L>Britons want but one Wife, and one King, and one GOD.</L>
<L>Derry down, down, down, derry down!</L>
