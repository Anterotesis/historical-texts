<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR PATRICK,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have left Ireland, and by your example have took up arms, and like the king I serve, with a firm resolution to flay both man, woman and child—I am in high favour with our officers—am a gentleman soldier, and in the high road to preferment—from your loving Friend till death.</P>

<P>Oh, dear good Mr. Adjutant, and you my good little drummers—my dear friends, pot companions, bro∣ther comrades and brother soldiers—now how can you have the heart to flog poor Darby?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor Darby—and is this thy preferment? <STAGE>aside</STAGE> Pray, Sir,—how came this poor fellow in such disgarce?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adj.</SPEAKER>
<P>A poor harmless devil, Sir—but sometimes a little prone to mischief—but for his arch tricks such a favourite with our officers, that tho' he frequently deserves punishment, yet he generally gets forgiven—and now, Sir, we give him this whipping as private as possible out of pure lenity—I have myself a very great friendship for poor Darby—so strip, you dog.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord Sir, I never strip but when I go to bed.—What are you about there Tommy, Tickleback?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only tying knots.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Tying the lash of his whip.</STAGE>
<SP>

<P>Tying knots—now that's very childish of you. And pray, what are you about, Neddy Nimblewrist?</P>

<SPEAKER>Ned.</SPEAKER>
<P>Twisting whipcord and wire—to give you a red waistcoat.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Sir, what's his crime?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adj.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only suspicion of drunkenness, and sleeping on his post.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, sleeping on my post—but I never dreamt that I should be flogg'd for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who is your Captain?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>At present, Sir; we have no Captain, he that was our captain was preferr'd prior to the review, and our new one is not arrived yet from Berlin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, but he is arrived, and honour'd with his Majesty's commission. I am he.</P>

<P>Ay release me—don't you hear, my dear friends—pot-companions, brother messmates, and brother sol∣diers, Neddy Nimblewrist, and Tommy Tickleback—I am not for the red waistcoat—so you may go and find another mouse for your cat o-nine-tails. Get out, get along. Ah, ha!</P>
<STAGE>Exeunt soldiers and drummers.</STAGE>
</SP>

<P>Yes, Sir, I am very glad to see you—but my dear Pat, how you came like my good guardian angel, to save me!—let me see—arn't you an angel?</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Looking round with pleasure and taking hold of his hand.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pat.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how is all this, Darby?—you ingenious rogue you, how did you bring all this about?—I left you at the plow tail in Ireland—and here I find you at the whipping post in Silesia.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
<SPEAKER>Dar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, 'twas you that did it—for when Captain Fitzroy made you a present of the colours, it set me all agog for a General's staff—and when that jade Kathleen jilted me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Away went carts and waggons—plows and flails.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, and because I could not do as I would, while I was worth a farthing, sold off all—and up to Dublin I came, mounted on a long tail'd dobin—and to be sure I did not do things neatly—did not trim my∣self out in a smart suit of cloaths, and shew them the soul of an Irish lad—but hearing that there were some pretty boys of the Shamrock in London, I thought I'd see that too; I don't know how it was, but in taking leave of this body and that body, I muddled a little, and the blundering waterman, instead of putting me into a Parkgate Packet—launched me on board a ship bound for the Baltic—and I never discover'd the mistake 'till I found myself landed at Dantzick; but how came you to sell your English commission, and turn Prussian soldier?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why at present my country does not want my services, and I thought if it should want them, that they would not prove less deserving of George by being for the present under the tuition of so regular a disciplined a master as Frederick.—The Prussian arms were ever fam'd for regularity—pray how comes it they have made you so irregular?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Irregular—the most regular—as regular to my two half gallons every day, as I was to Dermot's brown jug—But Patty, tho' you are my Captain, you and I may crack a joke now and then—the devil a harm will it do our strict Prussian discipline, for you and I, when we are snug, to talk over our merry meetings with our singing pot companions, Dermot and Father Luke, at the shoulder of murton.—Oh your ho∣nour <STAGE>[seeing Olmutz.]</STAGE> likes a shoulder of mutton—</P>

<P>So I go on well here in the German wars— My kind countryman, Captain Patrick—buries his nuckles in my throat, and never thinks it will spoil my singing; another swings a scythe about my ears;—and little Quiz threatens to blow my head over the bridge. Oh, to be sure, I'm not in a good thriving way;—but I must contrive some method to frighten Quiz—for I must confess, I have no great inclination to have my head blown into the river.—Oh, dear, oh, dear!—I am like a blind fiddler, always in some serape.</P>

<P>Don't be rash—in Ireland we always settle these sort of things very cool—now to fix the grand point. When people fight, as you and I do, without seconds, if one should be kill'd, as is always the case, that the conqueror may not fall a sacrifice to the law— we have two ways of disposing of the dead gentleman: —Now you may take which you please—one way is, we dig a hole on the spot, and cover him up, sweet and wholesome uncer the sod—this we call the Galway kick—but it he don't like that, the other is—we put him into a sack and tumble him into the river, this we call the Tipperary touch.</P>
