<HEAD>THE NEW-RIVER HEAD. A TALE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>DEAR WILKES, whose lively social Wit</L>
<L>Disdains the prudish Affectation</L>
<L>Of gloomy Folks, who love to sit</L>
<L>As Doctors <HI>should</HI> at Consultation,</L>
<L>Permit me, in familiar Strain,</L>
<L>To steal you from the idle hour</L>
<L>Of combating the NORTHERN THANE,</L>
<L>And all his puppet tools of Power.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
<L>Shame to the Wretch, if sense of shame</L>
<L>Can ever touch the miscreant's breast,</L>
<L>Who dead to virtue as to fame,</L>
<L>(A Monster whom the Gods detest)</L>
<L>Turns traitor to himself, to court</L>
<L>Or Minister or Monarch's smile;</L>
<L>And dares, in insolence of sport,</L>
<L>Invade the CHARTER of our Isle.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But why should I, who only strive,</L>
<L>By telling of an easy tale,</L>
<L>To keep attention half alive</L>
<L>'Gainst BOLGOLAM and FLIMNAP rail?</L>
<L>For whether ENGLAND be the name,</L>
<L>(Name which we're taught no more to prize)</L>
<L>Or BRITAIN, it is all the same,</L>
<L>The Lilliputian Statesmen rise</L>
<L>To malice of gigantic size.</L>
<L>Let them enjoy their warmth a while,</L>
<L>Truth shall regard them with a smile,</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="5"/>
While you, like GULLIVER, in sport</L>
<L>Piss out the fire, and save the Court.</L>
<L>But to return—The tale is old;</L>
<L>Indecent, truly none of mine—</L>
<L>What BEROALDUS gravely told;</L>
<L>I read it in that sound divine.</L>
<L>And for indecency, you know</L>
<L>She had her fashionable turn,</L>
<L>As prim observers clearly shew</L>
<L>In t'other Parson, Doctor STERNE.</L>
<L>Yet POPE denies it all defence,</L>
<L>And calls it, bless us! Want of sense.</L>
<L>But e'en the <HI>decent</HI> POPE can write</L>
<L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rape of the Lock.</NOTE>Of bottles, corks, and maiden sighs,</L>
<L>Of charming beauties less in sight,</L>
<L>Of the more secret precious hair,</L>
<L><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Pope's Letters.</NOTE>"And something else of little Size,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>You know where."</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="6"/>
If such Authorities prevail,</L>
<L>To varnish o'er this petty sin,</L>
<L>I plead a pardon for my tale,</L>
<L>And having hemm'd and cough'd—begin.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A Genius (one of those I mean,</L>
<L>We read of in th' Arabian Nights;</L>
<L>Not such as every day are seen</L>
<L>At Bob's or Arthur's, whilom White's;</L>
<L>For howsoe'er you change the name,</L>
<L>The Clubs and Meetings are the same;</L>
<L>Nor those prodigious learned folks,</L>
<L>Your Haberdashers of stale Jokes,</L>
<L>Who dress them up so neat and clean</L>
<L>For News-paper or Magazine;</L>
<L>But one that could play wond'rous tricks,</L>
<L>Changing the very course of Nature,</L>
<L>Not ASMODEUS on two sticks</L>
<L>Or sage URGANDA could do greater.)</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
<L>Once on a time incog. came down</L>
<L>From his equivocal dominions,</L>
<L>And travell'd o'er a country town</L>
<L>To try folks tempers and opinions:</L>
<L>When to accomplish his intent</L>
<L>(For had the cobler known the king,</L>
<L>Lord! it would quite have spoil'd the thing)</L>
<L>In strange disguise he slily went,</L>
<L>And stump'd along the high-way track,</L>
<L>With greasy knapsack at his back;</L>
<L>And now the night was pitchy dark,</L>
<L>Without one star's indulgent spark,</L>
<L>Whether he wanted sleep or not,</L>
<L>Is of no consequence to tell;</L>
<L>A bed and lodging must be got,</L>
<L>For geniuses live always well.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At the best house in all the town,</L>
<L>(It was th' attorney's you may swear)</L>
<L>He knock'd as he'd have beat it down,</L>
<L>Knock as you would, no entrance there.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="8"/>
But from the window cried the dame,</L>
<L>Go, sirrah go, from whence you came.</L>
<L>Here, Nell, John, Thomas, see who knocks,</L>
<L>Fellow, I'll put you in the stocks.</L>
<L>Be gentle ma'm, the Genius cried;</L>
<L>Have mercy on the wand'ring poor,</L>
<L>Who knows not where his head to hide,</L>
<L>And asks a pittance at your door.</L>
<L>A mug of beer, a crust of bread—</L>
<L>Have pity on the houseless head;</L>
<L>Your husband keeps a lordly table,</L>
<L>I ask but for the offal crumbs,</L>
<L>And for a lodging—barn or stable</L>
<L>Will shroud me till the morning comes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Twas all in vain; she rang the bell,</L>
<L>The servants trembl'd at the knell;</L>
<L>Down flew the maids to tell the men,</L>
<L>To drive the vagrant back agen.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
<L>He trudg'd away in angry mind,</L>
<L>And thought but cheaply of mankind,</L>
<L>Till thro' a casement's dingy pane,</L>
<L>A rush-light's melancholy ray,</L>
<L>Bad him e'en try his luck again;</L>
<L>Perhaps beneath a house of clay</L>
<L>A wand'ring passenger might find,</L>
<L>A better friend to human kind,</L>
<L>And far more hospitable fare,</L>
<L>Tho' not so costly, nice, or rare,</L>
<L>As smokes upon the silver plate</L>
<L>Of the luxurious pamper'd great.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So to this cot of homely thatch,</L>
<L>In the same plight the genius came:</L>
<L>Down comes the dame, lifts up the latch;</L>
<L>What want ye sir?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>God save you, dame.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="10"/>
And so he told the piteous tale,</L>
<L>Which you have heard him tell before,</L>
<L>Your patience and my own would fail</L>
<L>Were I to tell it o'er and o'er.</L>
<L>Suffice it, that my goody's care</L>
<L>Brought forth her best, tho' simple fare,</L>
<L>And from the corner-cupboard's hoard,</L>
<L>Her stranger guest the more to please,</L>
<L>Bespread her hospitable board</L>
<L>With what she had—'twas bread and cheese.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis honest tho' but homely cheer;</L>
<L>Much good may't do ye, eat your fill,</L>
<L>Would I cou'd treat you with strong beer,</L>
<L>But for the action take the will.</L>
<L>You see my cot is clean, tho' small,</L>
<L>Pray heav'n encrease my slender stock!</L>
<L>You're welcome, friend, you see my all;</L>
<L>And for your bed, sir—there's a flock.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
<L>No matter what was after said,</L>
<L>He eat and drank and went to bed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now the cock his mattins sung,</L>
<L>(Howe'er such singing's light esteem'd,</L>
<L>'Tis precious in the Muses' tongue</L>
<L>When sung rimes better than he scream'd)</L>
<L>The dame and pedlar both arose,</L>
<L>At early dawn of rising day,</L>
<L>She for her work of folding cloaths,</L>
<L>And He to travel on his way;</L>
<L>But much he thought himself to blame,</L>
<L>If, as in duty surely bound,</L>
<L>He did not thank the careful dame</L>
<L>For the reception he had found.</L>
<L>Hostess, quoth He, before I go,</L>
<L>I thank you for your hearty Fare;</L>
<L>Would it were in my pow'r to pay</L>
<L>My gratitude a better way;</L>
<L>But money now runs very low,</L>
<L>And I have not a doit to spare.</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="12"/>
But if you'll take this piece of Stuff—</L>
<L>—No quoth the dame, I'm poor as you,</L>
<L>Your kindest wishes are enough,</L>
<L>You're welcome, friend, farewell—Adieu.</L>
<L>But first reply'd the wand'ring guest,</L>
<L>For bed and board and homely dish,</L>
<L>May all things turn out for the best,</L>
<L>So take my blessing and my wish.</L>
<L>May what you first begin to do,</L>
<L>Create such profit and delight,</L>
<L>That you may do it all day through,</L>
<L>Nor finish till the depth of night.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thank you, she said, and shut the door,</L>
<L>Turn'd to her work, and thought no more.</L>
<L>And now the napkin, which was spread</L>
<L>To treat her guest with good brown bread,</L>
<L>She folded up with nicest care;</L>
<L>When lo! another napkin there!</L>
<L>And every folding did beget</L>
<L>Another and another yet.</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="13"/>
She folds a shift—by strange encrease,</L>
<L>The remnant swells into a piece.</L>
<L>Her Caps, her Laces, all the same,</L>
<L>Till such a quantity of Linen,</L>
<L>From such a very small beginning,</L>
<L>Flow'd in at once upon the Dame,</L>
<L>Who wonder'd how the duce it came,</L>
<L>That with the drap'ry she had got</L>
<L>Within her little shabby cot,</L>
<L>She might for all the town provide</L>
<L>And break both York-street and Cheapside.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>It happen'd that th' attorney's wife,</L>
<L>Who, to be sure, took much upon her,</L>
<L>As being one in higher Life,</L>
<L>Who did the Parish mighty honour,</L>
<L>Sent for the Dame, who, poor and willing,</L>
<L>Would take a job of charing work,</L>
<L>And sweat and toil like any Turk,</L>
<L>To earn a sixpence or a shilling.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
<L>She could not come, not she indeed!</L>
<L>She thank'd her much, but had no need.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Good news will fly as well as bad,</L>
<L>So out this wond'rous story came,</L>
<L>About the Pedlar and the Dame,</L>
<L>Which made th' Attorney's wife so mad,</L>
<L>That she resolv'd at any rate,</L>
<L>Spite of her pride and Lady airs,</L>
<L>To get the Pedlar téte a téte,</L>
<L>And make up all the past affairs,</L>
<L>And tho' she wish'd him at the devil,</L>
<L>When he came there the night before,</L>
<L>Determin'd to be monstrous civil,</L>
<L>And drop her curtsie at the door.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now all was racket, noise and pother,</L>
<L>Nell running one way, John another,</L>
<L>And Tom was on the coach-horse sent,</L>
<L>To learn which way the Pedlar went.</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="15"/>
Thomas return'd;—the Pedlar brought.</L>
<L>—What could my dainty Madam say,</L>
<L>For not behaving as she ought,</L>
<L>And driving honest folks away?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Upon my word, it shocks me much,</L>
<L>—But there's such thieving here of late—</L>
<L>Not that I dream'd that you were such,</L>
<L>When you came knocking at my gate.</L>
<L>I must confess myself to blame,</L>
<L>And I'm afraid you lately met</L>
<L>Sad treatment with that homely dame,</L>
<L>Who lives on what her hands can get.</L>
<L>Walk in with me at least to-night,</L>
<L>And let us set all matters right.</L>
<L>I know my duty, and indeed</L>
<L>Would help a friend in time of need.</L>
<L>Take such refreshment as you find,</L>
<L>I'm sure I mean it for the best,</L>
<L>And give it with a willing mind</L>
<L>To such a grave and sober guest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
<L>So in they came, and for his picking,</L>
<L>Behold the table covers spread,</L>
<L>Instead of Goody's cheese and bread,</L>
<L>With tarts, and fish, and flesh, and chicken.</L>
<L>And to appear in greater state,</L>
<L>The knives and forks with silver handles,</L>
<L>The candlesticks of bright (French) plate</L>
<L>To hold her best mould (tallow) candles,</L>
<L>Were all brought forth to be display'd,</L>
<L>In female housewifry parade.</L>
<L>And more the Pedlar to regale,</L>
<L>And make the wond'rous man her friend,</L>
<L>Decanters foam'd of mantling ale,</L>
<L>And port and claret without end;</L>
<L>They hobb'd and nobb'd, and smil'd and laugh'd,</L>
<L>Touch'd glasses, nam'd their toasts, and quaff'd;</L>
<L>Talk'd over every friend and foe,</L>
<L>Till eating, drinking, talking past,</L>
<L>The kind house-clock struck twelve at last.</L>
<L>When wishing Madam <HI>bon repos,</HI></L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="17"/>
The Pedlar pleaded weary head,</L>
<L>Made his low bow, and went to bed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Wishing him then at perfect ease,</L>
<L>A good soft bed, a good sound sleep,</L>
<L>Now, gentle reader, if you please,</L>
<L>We'll at the Lady take a peep.</L>
<L>She could not rest, but turn'd and toss'd,</L>
<L>While Fancy whisper'd in her brain,</L>
<L>That what her indiscretion lost,</L>
<L>Her art and cunning might regain.</L>
<L>Such Linnen to so poor a dame!</L>
<L>For such coarse fare! perplex'd her head;</L>
<L>Why might not she expect the same,</L>
<L>So courteous, civil, and well-bred?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now she reckon'd up her store</L>
<L>Of Cambricks, Hollands, Muslins, Lawns,</L>
<L>Free gifts, and Purchases, and Pawns,</L>
<L>Resolv'd to multiply them more,</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="18"/>
Till she had got a Stock of Linnen,</L>
<L>Fit for a Dowager to sin in.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The morning came, when up she got,</L>
<L>Most ceremoniously inclin'd</L>
<L>To wind up her sagacious plot,</L>
<L>With all that civil stuff we find</L>
<L>'Mongst those who talk a wond'rous deal</L>
<L>Of what they neither mean nor feel.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How shall I, Ma'm, reply'd the Guest,</L>
<L>Make you a suitable return,</L>
<L>For your attention and concern,</L>
<L>And such civilities exprest</L>
<L>To one, who must be still in debt</L>
<L>For all the kindness he has met?</L>
<L>For this your entertainment's sake,</L>
<L>If ought of good my wish can do,</L>
<L>May what you first shall undertake,</L>
<L>Last without ceasing all day through.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
<L>Madam, who kindly understood</L>
<L>His wish effectually good,</L>
<L>Strait dropp'd a curtsie wond'rous low,</L>
<L>For much she wanted him to go,</L>
<L>That she might look up all her store,</L>
<L>And turn it into thousands more.</L>
<L>Now all the maids were sent to look</L>
<L>In every cranny, hole and nook,</L>
<L>For every rag which they could find</L>
<L>Of any size, or any kind.</L>
<L>Draw'rs, Boxes, Closets, Chests and Cases</L>
<L>Were all unlock'd at once to get</L>
<L>Her Point, her Gawz, her Prussia-net,</L>
<L>With fifty names of fifty kinds,</L>
<L>Which suit variety of minds.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How shall I now my tale persue,</L>
<L>So passing strange, so passing true?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
<L>When every bit from every hoard,</L>
<L>Was brought and laid upon the board,</L>
<L>Left some more urgent obligation</L>
<L>Might interrupt her pleasing toil,</L>
<L>And marring half her application,</L>
<L>The promis'd hopes of profit spoil,</L>
<L>Before she folds a single rag,</L>
<L>Or takes a cap from board or bag,</L>
<L>That nothing might her work prevent,</L>
<L>(For she was now resolv'd to labour,</L>
<L>With earnest hope and full intent</L>
<L>To get the better of her neighbour)</L>
<L>Into the garden she would go</L>
<L>To do that necessary thing,</L>
<L>Which must by all be done, you know,</L>
<L>By rich and poor, and high and low,</L>
<L>By Male and Female, Queen and King.</L>
<L>She little dream'd a common action,</L>
<L>Practis'd as duly as her pray'rs,</L>
<L>Sould prove so tedious a transaction,</L>
<L>Or cost her such a sea of cares.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
<L>In short the streams so plenteous flow'd,</L>
<L>That in the dry and dusty weather,</L>
<L>She might have water'd all the road</L>
<L>For ten or twenty miles together.</L>
<L>What could she do? as it began,</L>
<L>Th' involuntary torrent ran.</L>
<L>Instead of folding Cap or Mob,</L>
<L>So dreadful was this distillation,</L>
<L>That from a simple watering job,</L>
<L>She fear'd a general Inundation.</L>
<L>While for her Indiscretion's crime,</L>
<L>And coveting too great a store,</L>
<L>She made a river at a time,</L>
<L>Which sure was never done before,</L>
