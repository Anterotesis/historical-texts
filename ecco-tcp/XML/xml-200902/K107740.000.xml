<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">P</SEG>ART of this POEM had the Honour of your Lordship's Perusal when in Manuscript, and it was no small Pride to me, when it met with
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
Approbation from so distinguish∣ing a Judge: Should the rest find the like Indulgence, I shall have no Occasion (whatever its Success may be in the World) to repent the Labour it has cost me.—But my Intention is not to pursue a Discourse on my own Performance; No, my Lord, it is to embrace this Opportunity of throwing out Sentiments that re∣late to your Lordship's Goodness, the Generosity of which, give me Leave to say, I have greatly ex∣perienc'd.</P>
<P>I offer it not as a new Remark, that Dependance on the Great, in former Times, generally ter∣minated in Disappointment; nay, even their Bounty (if it could be
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
called such) was in its very Na∣ture ungenerous. It was, per∣haps, with-held thro' an indolent, or wilful Neglect, 'till those, who lingered in the Want of it, grew almost past the Sense of Comfort. At length it came, too often, in a Manner, that half cancell'd the Obligation, and, perchance, must have been acquired too by some previous Act of Guilt in the Re∣ceiver, the Consequence of which was Remorse and Infamy.</P>
<P>But <HI>that I live,</HI> my Lord, is a Proof that Dependance on your Lordship, and the present Mini∣stry, is an Assurance of Success. I am persuaded Distress, in many other Instances, affects your Soul with a Compassion, that always
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
shews itself in a manner most hu∣mane and active; that to forgive Injuries, and confer Benefits, is your Delight; and that to deserve your Friendship is to deserve the Countenance of the best of Men: To be admitted into the Honour of your Lordship's Conversation (permit me to speak but Justice) is to be elegantly introduced into the most instructive, as well as entertaining, Parts of Literature; it is to be furnish'd with the finest Observations upon human Na∣ture, and to receive from the most unassuming, sweet, and winning Candour, the worthiest and most polite Maxims—Such as are always enforc'd by the Actions of your own Life. I could also take Notice of your many pub∣lick-spirited
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
Services to your Country in Parliament, and your constant Attachment to Liberty, and the Royal, Illustri∣ous House of our Most <HI>Gracious Sovereign;</HI> But, my Lord, be∣lieve me, your own Deeds are the noblest and fittest Orators to speak your Praise, and will elevate it far beyond the Power of a much abler Writer than I am.</P>
<P>I will therefore turn my View from your Lordship's Virtues to the kind Influence of them, which has been so lately shed upon me; and then, if my future Mo∣rals and Writings shall gain any Approbation from Men of Parts and Probity, I must acknowledge all to be the Product of your
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
Lordship's Goodness to me. I must, in fine, say with <HI>Horace,</HI><Q><L>Quod spiro, &amp; placeo (si placeo) tuum est.</L></Q></P>
<P>I am, with the highest Grati∣tude and Veneration,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE>

<L><SEG REND="decorInit">F</SEG>AIN wou'd my Verse, TYRCONNEL, boast thy Name,</L>
<L>BROWNLOW, at once my Subject, and my Fame!</L>
<L>Oh! cou'd that Spirit, which thy Bosom warms,</L>
<L>Whose Strength surprizes, and whose Goodness charms!</L>
<L>That various Worth!—cou'd that inspire my Lays,</L>
<L>Envy shou'd smile, and Censure learn to praise:</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="10"/>
Yet, tho' unequal to a Soul, like thine,</L>
<L>A generous Soul, approaching to Divine,</L>
<L>When bless'd beneath such Patronage I write,</L>
<L>Great my Attempt, tho' hazardous my Flight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O'er ample Nature I extend my Views;</L>
<L>Nature to rural Scenes invites the Muse:</L>
<L>She flies all public Care, all venal Strife,</L>
<L>To try the <HI>Still,</HI> compar'd with <HI>Active</HI> Life;</L>
<L>To prove, by these the Sons of Men may owe</L>
<L>The Fruits of Bliss to bursting Clouds of Woe,</L>
<L>That ev'n Calamity, by Thought refin'd,</L>
<L>Inspirits, and adorns the thinking Mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Come, CONTEMPLATION, whose unbounded Gaze,</L>
<L>Swift in a Glance, the Course of Things, surveys;</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="11"/>
Who in <HI>Thy-self</HI> the various View can'st find</L>
<L>Of Sea, Land, Air, and Heav'n, and human Kind;</L>
<L>What Tides of Passion in the Bosom roll;</L>
<L>What Thoughts debase, and what exalt the Soul;</L>
<L>Whose Pencil paints, obsequious to thy Will,</L>
<L>All thou survey'st, with a creative Skill!</L>
<L>Oh, leave a-while thy lov'd, sequester'd Shade!</L>
<L>A-while in wintry Wilds vouchsafe thy Aid!</L>
<L>Then waft me to some olive, bow'ry Green;</L>
<L>Where, cloath'd in white, thou shew'st a Mind serene;</L>
<L>Where kind <HI>Content</HI> from Noise, and Court retires,</L>
<L>And smiling sits, while Muses tune their Lyres:</L>
<L>Where <HI>Zephyrs</HI> gently breathe, while <HI>Sleep</HI> profound</L>
<L>To their soft Fanning nods, with Poppies crown'd,</L>
<L><HI>Sleep</HI> on a Treasure of bright Dreams reclines,</L>
<L>By <HI>thee</HI> bestow'd; whence <HI>Fancy</HI> colour'd shines,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="12"/>
And flutters round his Brow a hov'ring Flight,</L>
<L>Varying her Plumes in visionary Light.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The solar Fires now faint, and watry burn,</L>
<L>Just where with Ice <HI>Aquarius</HI> frets his Urn!</L>
<L>If thaw'd, full-issue from its Mouth severe,</L>
<L>Raw Clouds, that sadden all th'inverted Year.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When FROST and FIRE with martial Pow'rs en∣gag'd,</L>
<L>FROST, northward, fled the War, unequal wag'd!</L>
<L>Beneath the Pole his Legions urg'd their Flight,</L>
<L>And gain'd a Cave profound, and wide as Night.</L>
<L>O'er chearless Scenes by Desolation own'd,</L>
<L>High on an Alp of Ice he sits enthron'd!</L>
<L>One clay-cold Hand, his crystal Beard, sustains,</L>
<L>And scepter'd One, o'er Wind, and Tempest, reigns;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="13"/>
O'er stony Magazines of Hail, that storm</L>
<L>The blossom'd Fruit, and flow'ry Spring deform.</L>
<L>His languid Eyes, like frozen Lakes, appear,</L>
<L>Dim-gleaming all the Light, that wanders here.</L>
<L>His Robe snow-wrought, and hoar'd with Age; his Breath</L>
<L>A nitrous Damp, that strikes pertific Death.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Far hence lies, ever-freez'd, the Northern Main,</L>
<L>That checks, and renders Navigation vain,</L>
<L>That, shut against the Sun's dissolving Ray,</L>
<L>Scatters the trembling Tides of vanquish'd Day,</L>
<L>And stretching <HI>Eastward</HI> half the World secures,</L>
<L>Defies Discov'ry, and like Time endures!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now FROST sent boreal Blasts to scourge the Air,</L>
<L>To bind the Streams, and leave the Landscape bare;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="14"/>
Yet when <HI>far-west,</HI> his Violence declines;</L>
<L>Tho' here the Brook, or Lake, his Pow'r confines;</L>
<L>To rocky Pools, to Cat'racts are unknown</L>
<L>His Chains!—to Rivers, rapid like the <HI>Rhone!</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The falling Moon cast cold, a quiv'ring Light,</L>
<L>Just silver'd o'er the Snow, and sunk!—Pale Night</L>
<L>Retir'd. The Dawn in light-grey Mists arose!</L>
<L>Shrill chants the Cock!—the hungry Heifer lows!</L>
<L>Slow blush yon breaking Clouds!—the Sun's up∣roll'd!</L>
<L>Th'expansive <HI>Grey</HI> turns azure, chac'd with Gold;</L>
<L>White-glitt'ring Ice, chang'd like the <HI>Topaz,</HI> gleams,</L>
<L>Reflecting Saffron Lustre from his Beams.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O <HI>Contemplation,</HI> teach me to explore,</L>
<L>From <HI>Britain</HI> far remote, some distant Shore!</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="15"/>
From <HI>Sleep</HI> a Dream distinct, and lively Claim;</L>
<L>Clear let the Vision strike the Moral's Aim!</L>
<L>It comes! I feel it o'er my Soul serene!</L>
<L>Still <HI>Morn</HI> begins, and <HI>Frost</HI> retains the Scene!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hark!—the loud Horn's enlivening Note's begun!</L>
<L>From Rock to Vale sweet-wand'ring Echoes run!</L>
<L>Still floats the Sound shrill-winding from afar!</L>
<L>Wild Beasts astonish'd dread the Sylvan War!</L>
<L>Spears to the Sun in Files embattled play,</L>
<L>March on, charge briskly, and enjoy the Fray!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Swans, Ducks, and Geese, and the wing'd, Winter Brood,</L>
<L>Chatter discordant on yon echoing Flood!</L>
<L>At <HI>Babel</HI> thus, when Heav'n the Tongue con∣founds,</L>
<L>Sudden a thousand different, jargon Sounds,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="16"/>
Like jangling Bells, harsh-mingling, grate the Ear!</L>
<L>All stare! all talk! all mean; but none cohere!</L>
<L>Mark! wiley Fowlers meditate their Doom,</L>
<L>And smoky <HI>Fate</HI> speeds thund'ring thro' the Gloom!</L>
<L>Stop'd short, they cease in airy Rings to fly,</L>
<L>Whirl o'er, and o'er, and, flutt'ring, fall and die.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Still Fancy wafts me on! deceiv'd I stand,</L>
<L>Estrang'd, adventrous on a foreign Land!</L>
<L>Wide and more wide extends the Scene unknown!</L>
<L>Where shall I turn, a <HI>Wanderer,</HI> and alone?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From hilly Wilds, and Depths where Snows re∣main,</L>
<L>My winding Steps up a steep Mountain strain!</L>
<L>Emers'd a-top I mark the Hills subside,</L>
<L>And Tow'rs aspire but with inferior Pride!</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="17"/>
On this bleak Height tall Firs, with Ice-work crown'd,</L>
<L>Bend, while their flaky Winter shades the Ground!</L>
<L>Hoarse, and direct, a blust'ring North-wind blows!</L>
<L>On Boughs, thick-rustling, crack the crispid Snows!</L>
<L>Tangles of Frost half fright the wilder'd Eye,</L>
<L>By Heat oft blacken'd like a low'ring Sky!</L>
<L>Hence down the Side two turbid Riv'lets pour,</L>
<L>And devious Two, in one huge Cat'ract, roar!</L>
<L>While pleas'd the watry Progress I pursue,</L>
<L>Yon Rocks in rough Assemblage rush in View!</L>
<L>In form an Amphitheatre they rise;</L>
<L>And a dark Gulph in their broad Center lies.</L>
<L>There the dim'd Sight with dizzy Weakness fails,</L>
<L>And Horror o'er the firmest Brain prevails!</L>
<L>Thither these Mountain-streams their Passage take,</L>
<L>Headlong foam down, and form a dreadful Lake!</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="18"/>
The Lake, high-swelling, so redundant grows,</L>
<L>From the heap'd Store deriv'd a River flows;</L>
<L>Which deep'ning travels thro' a distant Wood,</L>
<L>And, thence emerging, meets a Sister-flood;</L>
<L>Mingled they flash on a wide-opening Plain,</L>
<L>And pass yon City to the far-seen Main.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So blend two Souls by Heav'n for Union made,</L>
<L>And strength'ning forward, lend a mutual Aid,</L>
<L>And prove in ev'ry transient Turn their Aim,</L>
<L>Thro' finite Life to infinite the same.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor ends the Landscape—Ocean, to my Sight,</L>
<L>Points a blue Arm, where sailing Ships delight,</L>
<L>In Prospect lessen'd!—Now new Rocks, rear'd high,</L>
<L>Stretch a cross Ridge, and bar the curious Eye!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="11" REF="19"/>
<L>There lies obscur'd the ripening Diamond's Ray,</L>
<L>And thence red-branching Coral's rent away.</L>
<L>In conic Form there gelid Crystal grows;</L>
<L>Thro' such the Palace-Lamp, gay Lustre, throws!</L>
<L>Lustre, which, thro' dim Night, as various plays,</L>
<L>As play from yonder Snows the changeful Rays!</L>
<L>For nobler Use the Crystal's Worth may rise,</L>
<L>If Tubes perspective hem the spotless Prize;</L>
<L>Thro' these the Beams of the far-lengthen'd Eye</L>
<L>Measure known Stars, and new remoter spy.</L>
<L>Hence <HI>Commerce</HI> many a shorten'd Voyage steers,</L>
<L>Shorten'd to Months, the Hazard once of Years;</L>
<L>Hence HALLEY's Soul etherial Flight essays;</L>
<L>Instructive there from Orb to Orb she strays;</L>
<L>Sees, round new countless Suns, new Systems roll!</L>
<L>Sees God in <HI>All!</HI> and magnifies the Whole!</L>

Yon rocky Side enrich'd the Summer Scene,</L>
<L>And Peasant's Search with Herbs of healthful Green;</L>
<L>Now naked, pale, and comfortless it lies,</L>
<L>Like Youth extended cold in Death's Disguise.</L>
<L>There, while without the sounding Tempest swells,</L>
<L>Incav'd secure th'exulting Eagle dwells;</L>
<L>And there, when Nature owns prolific Spring,</L>
<L>Spreads o'er her Young a fondling Mother's Wing.</L>
<L>Swains on the Coast the far-fam'd Fish descry,</L>
<L>That gives the fleecy Robe the <HI>Tyrian</HI> Dye;</L>
<L>While Shells, a scatter'd Ornament, bestow;</L>
<L>The tinctur'd Rivals of the show'ry Bow.</L>
<L>Yon limeless Sands, loose-driving with the Wind,</L>
<L>In future Cauldrons useful Texture find,</L>
<L>Till, on the Furnace thrown, the glowing Mass</L>
<L>Brightens, and bright'ning hardens into Glass.</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="23"/>
When winter Halcyons, flick'ring on the Wave,</L>
<L>Tune their Complaints, yon Sea forgets to rave;</L>
<L>Tho' lash'd by Storms, which naval Pride o'erturn,</L>
<L>The foaming Deep in Sparkles seems to burn,</L>
<L>Loud Winds turn Zephyrs to enlarge their Notes,</L>
<L>And each safe Nest on a calm Surface floats.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now veers the Wind full East; and keen, and sore,</L>
<L>Its cutting Influence akes in ev'ry Pore!</L>
<L>How weak thy Fabrick, Man!—A Puff, thus blown,</L>
<L>Staggers thy Strength, and echoes to thy Groan.</L>
<L>A Tooth's minutest Nerve let Anguish seize,</L>
<L>Swift kindred Fibres catch! (so frail our Ease!)</L>
<L>Pinch'd, pierc'd, and torn, enflam'd, and unas∣suag'd,</L>
<L>They smart, and swell, and throb, and shoot en∣rag'd!</L>
<L>From Nerve to Nerve fierce flies th'exulting Pain!</L>
<L>—And are we of this mighty Fabrick vain?</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="24"/>
Now my Blood chills! scarce thro' my Veins it glides!</L>
<L>Sure on each Blast a shiv'ring Ague rides!</L>
<L>Warn'd let me this bleak Eminence forsake,</L>
<L>And to the Vale a diff'rent Winding take!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Half I descend: My Spirits fast decay;</L>
<L>A Terrass now relieves my weary Way.</L>
<L>Close with this Stage a Precipice combines;</L>
<L>Whence still the spacious Country far declines!</L>
<L>The Herds seem Insects in the distant Glades,</L>
<L>And Men diminish'd, as at Noon their Shades!</L>
<L>Thick on this Top o'ergrown for Walks are seen</L>
<L>Grey, leafless Wood, and winter Greens between!</L>
<L>The red'ning Berry, deep-ting'd Holly shows,</L>
<L>And matted Misleto, the white, bestows!</L>
<L>Tho', lost the Banquet of autumnal Fruits,</L>
<L>Tho' on broad Oaks, no vernal Umbrage shoots;</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="25"/>
These Boughs, the silenc'd, shiv'ring Songsters seek!</L>
<L>These foodful Berries fill the hungry Beak.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Beneath appears a Place, all outward bare,</L>
<L>Inward the dreary Mansion of Despair!</L>
<L>The Water of the Mountain-Road, half-stray'd,</L>
<L>Breaks o'er it wild, and falls a brown Cascade.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Has Nature this rough, naked Piece design'd,</L>
<L>To hold Inhabitant of mortal Kind?</L>
<L>She has. Approach'd, appears a deep Descent,</L>
<L>Which opens in a Rock a large Extent!</L>
<L>And hark!—its hollow Entrance reach'd, I hear</L>
<L>A trampling Sound of Footsteps hast'ning near!</L>
<L>A death-like Chillness thwarts my panting Breast:</L>
<L>Soft! the wish'd Object stands at length confest!</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="26"/>
Of Youth his Form!—But why with Anguish bent?</L>
<L>Why pin'd with sallow Marks of Discontent?</L>
<L>Yet Patience, lab'ring to beguile his Care,</L>
<L>Seems to raise Hope, and smiles away Despair.</L>
<L><HI>Compassion</HI> in his Eye surveys my Grief,</L>
<L>And in his Voice invites me to Relief.</L>
<L>Preventive of thy Call, behold my haste,</L>
<L>(He says.) Nor let warm Thanks thy Spirits waste!</L>
<L>All Fear forget—Each Portal I possess,</L>
<L>Duty wide-opens to receive Distress.</L>
<L>Oblig'd, I follow, by his Guidance led:</L>
<L>The vaulted Roof re-echoing to our Tread!</L>
<L>And now, in squar'd Divisions, I survey</L>
<L>Chambers sequester'd from the Glare of Day;</L>
<L>Yet needful Lights, are taught to intervene,</L>
<L>Thro' Rifts; each forming a perspective Scene.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="17" REF="27"/>
<L>In Front a Parlour meets my ent'ring View;</L>
<L>Oppos'd, a Room to sweet Refection due.</L>
<L>Here my chill'd Veins are warm'd by chippy Fires,</L>
<L>Thro' the bor'd Rock above, the Smoke expires;</L>
<L>Neat, o'er a homely Board, a Napkin's spread,</L>
<L>Crown'd with a heapy Canister of Bread.</L>
<L>A Maple Cup is next dispatch'd, to bring</L>
<L>The Comfort of the salutary Spring:</L>
<L>Nor mourn we absent Blessings of the Vine,</L>
<L>Here laughs a frugal Bowl of rosy Wine;</L>
<L>And sav'ry Cates, upon clear Embers cast,</L>
<L>Lie hissing, till snatch'd off; a rich Repast!</L>
<L>Soon leap my Spirits with enliven'd Pow'r,</L>

<L>Meat for keen Famine, and the gen'rous Juice,</L>
<L>That warms chill'd Life, her Charities produce:</L>
<L>Accept without Reward; unask'd 'twas mine;</L>
<L>Here what thy Health requires, as free be thine.</L>
<L>Hence learn that GOD, (who, in the Time of Need,</L>
<L>In frozen Desarts can the Raven feed)</L>
<L>Well-sought, will delegate some pitying Breast,</L>
<L>His second Means, to succour Man distrest.</L>
<L>He paus'd. Deep Thought upon his Aspect gloom'd;</L>
<L>Then He, with Smile humane, his Voice resum'd.</L>
<L>I'm just inform'd, (and laugh me not to scorn)</L>
<L>By One unseen by thee, thou'rt <HI>English-born.</HI></L>
<L>Of <HI>England</HI> I—To me the <HI>British</HI> State,</L>

Here stand we conscious!—Diffidence suspend!</L>
<L>Free flow our Words!—Did ne'er thy Muse extend</L>
<L>To Grots, where <HI>Contemplation</HI> smiles serene,</L>
<L>Where Angels visit, and where Joys convene?</L>
<L>To Groves, where more than mortal Voices rise,</L>
<L>Catch the rapt Soul, and waft it to the Skies?</L>
<L>This Cave!—Yon Walks!—But e'er I more unfold,</L>
<L>What artful Scenes, thy Eyes shall here behold,</L>
<L>Think Subjects of my Toil: nor wond'ring gaze!</L>
<L>What cannot <HI>Industry</HI> completely raise?</L>
<L>Be the whole Earth in one great Landscape found,</L>
<L>By <HI>Industry</HI> is all with Beauty crown'd!</L>
<L>He, He alone explores the Mine for Gain,</L>
<L>Hues the hard Rock, or harrows up the Plain;</L>
<L>He forms the Sword to smite; He sheaths the Steel,</L>
<L>Draws Health from Herbs, and shews the Balm to heal;</L>

Or with loom'd Wool the native Robe supplies;</L>
<L>Or bids young Plants in future Forests rise;</L>
<L>Or fells the monarch Oak; which, borne away,</L>

<L>Hence golden <HI>Commerce</HI> views her Wealth encrease,</L>
<L>The blissful Child of Liberty and Peace.</L>
<L>He scoops the stubborn <HI>Alps,</HI> and, still employ'd,</L>
<L>Fills with soft, fertile Mold the steril Void;</L>
<L>Slop'd up white Rocks, small, yellow Harvests grow,</L>
<L>And, green on terrass'd Stages, Vineyards blow!</L>
<L>By him fall Mountains to a level Space,</L>
<L>An <HI>Isthmus</HI> sinks, and sunder'd Seas embrace!</L>
<L>He founds a City on the naked Shore,</L>
<L>And Desolation starves the Tract no more.</L>
<L>From the wild Waves he won the <HI>Belgic</HI> Land;</L>
<L>Where wide they foam'd, her Towns, and Traf∣ficks stand;</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="31"/>
He clear'd, manur'd, enlarg'd the furtive Ground,</L>

<L>Ev'n <HI>Mid</HI> the watry World his <HI>Venice</HI> rose,</L>
<L>Each Fabric there, as <HI>Pleasure</HI>'s Seat he shows!</L>
<L>There Marts, Sports, Councils are for Action sought,</L>
<L>Landscapes for Health, and Solitude for Thought.</L>
<L>What wonder then I, by his potent Aid,</L>
<L>A Mansion in a barren Mountain made?</L>
<L>Part thou hast view'd!—If further we explore,</L>

<L>No frowning Care yon blest Apartment sees,</L>
<L>There <HI>Sleep</HI> retires, and finds a Couch of Ease.</L>
<L>Kind Dreams, that fly Remorse, and pamper'd Wealth,</L>

To secret Ferment is each Heart resign'd;</L>
<L>Suspicion hovers in each clouded Mind;</L>
<L>They jar, accus'd accuse, revil'd revile,</L>

<L>Wrangling they part, themselves themselves be∣tray;</L>
<L>Each dire Device starts naked into Day;</L>
<L>They feel Confusion in the Van with Fear;</L>
<L>They feel the King of Terrors in the Rear.</L>

<L>Of these were Three by diff'rent Motives fir'd,</L>
<L>Ambition One, and One Revenge inspir'd.</L>
<L>The Third, O <HI>Mammon,</HI> was thy meaner Slave;</L>
<L>Thou Idol seldom of the Great, and Brave.</L>

Vain Pomp, and Equipage his low Desires,</L>
<L>Who ne'er to intellectual Bliss aspires;</L>
<L>He, to repair by Vice what Vice has broke,</L>
<L>Durst with bold Treasons Judgment's Rod provoke.</L>
<L>His Strength of Mind, by Lux'ry half-dissolv'd,</L>
<L>Ill brooks the Woe, where deep he stands involv'd.</L>
<L>He weeps, stamps wild, and to and fro now flies;</L>
<L>Now wrings his Hands, and sends unmanly Cries,</L>
<L>Arraigns his Judge, affirms unjust he bleeds,</L>
<L>And now recants, and now for Mercy pleads;</L>
<L>Now blames Associates, raves with inward Strife,</L>
<L>Upbraids himself; then thinks alone on Life.</L>
<L>He rolls red-swelling, tearful Eyes around,</L>
<L>Sore smites his Breast, and sinks upon the Ground.</L>
<L>He wails, he quite desponds, convulsive lies,</L>
<L>Shrinks from the fancied Ax, and thinks he dies:</L>
<L><PB N="127" REF="137"/>
Revives, with Hope enquires, stops short with Fear,</L>
<L>Entreats ev'n Flatt'ry, nor the worst will hear;</L>
<L>The worst, alas, his Doom!—What Friend re∣plies?</L>
<L>Each speaks with shaking Head, and down-cast Eyes.</L>
<L>One Silence breaks, then pauses, drops a Tear;</L>
<L>Nor Hope affords, nor quite confirms his Fear;</L>
<L>But what kind Friendship part reserves unknown</L>
<L>Comes thund'ring in his Keeper's surly Tone.</L>
<L>Enough—struck thro' and thro', in ghastly Stare,</L>
<L>He stands transfixt, the Statue of Despair;</L>
<L>Nor ought of Life, nor ought of Death he knows,</L>
<L>Till Thought returns, and brings Return of Woes:</L>
<L>Now pours a Storm of Grief in gushing Streams:</L>
<L>That past—Collected in himself he seems,</L>
<L>And with forc'd Smile retires—His latent Thought</L>
<L>Dark, horrid, as the Prison's dismal Vault.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="128" REF="138"/>
<L>If with himself at Variance ever-wild,</L>
<L>With angry Heav'n how stands he reconcil'd?</L>
<L>No penitential Orisons arise;</L>
<L>Nay he obtests the Justice of the Skies.</L>
<L>Not for his Guilt, for sentenc'd Life he moans;</L>
<L>His Chains rough-clanking to discordant Groans,</L>
<L>To Bars harsh-grating, heavy-creaking Doors,</L>
<L>Hoarse-echoing Walls, and hollow-ringing Floors,</L>
<L>To Thoughts more dissonant, far, far less kind,</L>
<L>One <HI>Anarchy,</HI> one <HI>Chaos</HI> of the <HI>Mind.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At length, fatigu'd with Grief, on Earth he lies:</L>
<L>But soon as Sleep weighs down th'unwilling Eyes,</L>
<L>Glad Liberty appears, no Damps annoy;</L>
<L>Treason succeeds, and all transforms to Joy.</L>
<L><PB N="129" REF="139"/>
Proud Palaces their glitt'ring Stores display;</L>
<L>Gain he pursues, and Rapine leads the Way.</L>
<L>What Gold? What Gems?—He strains to seize the Prize;</L>
<L>Quick from his Touch dissolv'd, a Cloud it flies.</L>
<L>Conscious he cries.—And must I wake to weep?</L>
<L>Ah, yet return, return delusive Sleep!</L>
<L>Sleep comes; but Liberty no more:—Unkind,</L>
<L>The Dungeon-Glooms hang heavy on his Mind.</L>
<L>Shrill Winds are heard, and howling Daemons call;</L>
<L>Wide-flying Portals seem unhing'd to fall;</L>
<L>Then close with sudden Claps; a dreadful Din!</L>
<L>He starts, wakes, storms, and all is Hell within.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His Genius flies—reflects he now on Prayer?</L>
<L>Alas! bad Spirits turn those Thoughts to Air.</L>
<L>What shall he next? What, straight relinquish Breath,</L>
<L>To bar a publick, just, tho' shameful Death?</L>
<L><PB N="130" REF="140"/>
Rash, horrid Thought! yet now afraid to live,</L>

<L>Why had he thus false Spirit to rebel?</L>
<L>And why not Fortitude to suffer well?</L>

<L>Heav'n this Affliction then for Mercy meant,</L>

<L>Where no kind Lips the hallow'd Dirge resound,</L>

<L>Full in the Center of three meeting Ways,</L>

<L>Near yonder Fane, where Mis'ry sleeps in Peace,</L>

<L>His Grave by unbid Plants of Poison crown'd.</L>
<L>When out of Pow'r, thro' him the Publick Good,</L>
<L>So strong his factious Tribe, suspended stood.</L>
<L>In Pow'r, vindictive Actions were his Aim,</L>
<L>And Patriots perish'd by th' ungenerous Flame.</L>
<L>If the best Cause he in the Senate chose,</L>
<L>Ev'n Right in him from some wrong Motive rose.</L>
<L>The Bad he loath'd, and wou'd the Weak despise;</L>
<L>Yet courted for dark Ends, and shun'd the Wise.</L>
<L>When ill his Purpose, eloquent his Strain;</L>
<L>His Malice had a Look, and Voice humane.</L>
<L>His Smile, the Signal of some vile Intent,</L>
<L>A private Ponyard, or empoison'd Scent;</L>
<L><PB N="132" REF="142"/>
Proud, yet to popular Applause a Slave;</L>
<L>No Friend he honour'd, and no Foe forgave.</L>
<L>His Boons unfrequent, or unjust to Need;</L>
<L>The Hire of Guilt, of Infamy the Meed,</L>
<L>But if they chanc'd on Learned Worth to fall,</L>
<L>Bounty in him was Ostentation all.</L>
<L>No true Benevolence his Thought sublimes,</L>
<L>His noblest Actions are illustrious Crimes.</L>
<L>Fine Parts, which Virtue might have rank'd with Fame,</L>
<L>Enhance his Guilt, and magnify his Shame.</L>
<L>When Parts, and Probity in Man combine,</L>
<L>In Wisdom's Eye, How charming must he shine?</L>
<L>Let him, less happy, Truth at least impart,</L>
<L>And what he wants in Genius bear in Heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Cosmo,</HI> as Death draws nigh, no more conceals</L>
<L>That Storm of Passions, which his Nature feels;</L>
<L><PB N="133" REF="143"/>
He feels much Fear, more Anger, and most Pride;</L>
<L>But Pride and Anger make all Fear subside.</L>
<L>Dauntless He meets at length untimely Fate;</L>
<L>A desp'rate Spirit! rather Fierce, than Great.</L>
<L>Darkling he glides along the dreary Coast,</L>
<L>A sullen, wand'ring, self-tormenting Ghost.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where veiny Marble dignifies the Ground,</L>
<L>With Emblem fair in Sculpture rising round,</L>
<L>Just where a crossing, length'ning Isle we find,</L>
<L>Full East; whence God returns to judge Mankind,</L>
<L>Once-lov'd <HI>Horatio</HI> sleeps, a Mind elate!</L>
<L>Lamented Shade, <HI>Ambition</HI> was thy Fate!</L>
<L>Ev'n Angels, wond'ring, oft his Worth survey'd;</L>
<L><HI>Behold a Man, like One of Us!</HI> they said.</L>
<L>Straight heard the Furies, and with Envy glar'd,</L>
<L>And to precipitate his Fall prepar'd:</L>
<L><PB N="134" REF="144"/>
First <HI>Av'rice</HI> came. In vain Self-Love she press'd;</L>
<L>The Poor he pitied still, and still redress'd:</L>
<L>Learning was his, and Knowledge to commend,</L>
<L>Of Arts a Patron, and of Want a Friend.</L>
<L>Next came <HI>Revenge:</HI> But her Essay, how vain?</L>
<L>Nor Hate, nor Envy, in his Heart remain.</L>
<L>No previous Malice cou'd his Mind engage,</L>
<L>Malice, the Mother of vindictive Rage.</L>
<L>No—from his Life his Foes might learn to live;</L>
<L>He held it still a Triumph to forgive.</L>
<L>At length <HI>Ambition</HI> urg'd his Country's Weal,</L>
<L>Assuming the fair Look of publick <HI>Zeal;</HI></L>
<L>Still in his Breast so gen'rous glow'd the Flame,</L>
<L>The Vice, when there, a Virtue half became.</L>
<L>His pitying Eye saw Millions in Distress,</L>
<L>He deem'd it God-like to have Pow'r to bless;</L>
<L><PB N="135" REF="145"/>
Thus, when unguarded, Treason stain'd him o'er,</L>
<L>And Virtue, and Content were then no more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But when to Death by rig'rous Justice doom'd,</L>
<L>His genuine Spirit Saint-like State resum'd.</L>
<L>Oft from soft Penitence distill'd a Tear;</L>
<L>Oft Hope in heav'nly Mercy lighten'd Fear;</L>
<L>Oft wou'd a Drop from strugling Nature fall,</L>
<L>And then a Smile of Patience brighten all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He seeks in Heav'n a Friend, nor seeks in vain;</L>
<L>His guardian Angel swift descends again;</L>
<L>And Resolution thus bespeaks a Mind,</L>
<L>Not scorning Life, yet all to Death resign'd;</L>
<L>—Ye Chains, fit only to restrain the Will</L>
<L>Of common, desp'rate Veterans in Ill,</L>
<L><PB N="136" REF="146"/>
Tho' rankling on my Limbs ye lie, declare,</L>
<L>Did e'er my rising Soul your Pressure wear?</L>
<L>No!—free as Liberty, and quick as Light,</L>
<L>To Worlds remote she takes unbounded Flight.</L>
<L>Ye Dungeon-Glooms, that dim corporeal Eyes,</L>
<L>Cou'd ye once blot her Prospect of the Skies?</L>
<L>No!—from her clearer Sight, ye fled away,</L>
<L>Like Error, pierc'd by Truths resistless Ray.</L>
<L>Ye Walls, that witness my repentant Moan!</L>
<L>Ye Echoes, that to midnight Sorrows groan!</L>
<L>Do I, in Wrath, to you of Fate complain?</L>
<L>Or once betray Fear's most inglorious Pain?</L>
<L>No!—Hail, twice hail then ignominious Death!</L>
<L>Behold how willing glides my parting Breath!</L>
<L>Far greater, better far,—Ay sar indeed!</L>
<L>Like me, <HI>have</HI> suffer'd, and like me <HI>will</HI> bleed.</L>
<L><PB N="137" REF="147"/>
Apostles, Patriarchs, Prophets, Martyrs all,</L>
<L>Like me, once fell, nor murmur'd at their Fall.</L>
<L>Shall I, whose Days, at best, no Ill design'd,</L>
<L>Whose Virtue shone not, tho' I lov'd Mankind,</L>
<L>Shall I, now guilty Wretch, shall I repine?</L>
<L>Ah, no! to Justice let me Life resign!</L>
<L>Quick, as a Friend, wou'd I embrace my Foe!</L>
<L>He taught me Patience, who first taught me Woe;</L>
<L>But Friends are Foes, they render Woe severe,</L>
<L>For me they wail, from me extort the Tear.</L>
<L>Not those, yet-absent, missive Griefs controul;</L>
<L>These Periods weep, those rave, and these condole.</L>
<L>At Entrance shrieks a Friend, with pale Surprize;</L>
<L>Another panting, prostrate, speechless lies;</L>
<L>One gripes my Hand, one sobs upon my Breast!</L>
<L>Ah, who can bear?—It shocks, it murders Rest!</L>
<L><PB N="138" REF="148"/>
And is it your's, alas! my Friends to feel?</L>
<L>And is it mine to comfort, mine to heal?</L>
<L>Is mine the Patience, your's the Bosom-strife?</L>
<L>Ah! wou'd rash Love lure back my Thoughts to Life?</L>
<L>Adieu, dear, dang'rous Mourners! swift depart!</L>
<L>Ah, fly me! fly!—I tear ye from my Heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye Saints, whom Fears of Death cou'd ne'er controul,</L>
<L>In my last Hour compose, support my Soul!</L>
<L>See my Blood wash repented Sin away!</L>
<L>Receive, receive me to eternal Day!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With Words like these the destin'd Hero dies,</L>
<L>While Angels waft his Soul to happier Skies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Distinction now gives way; yet on we talk,</L>
<L>Full Darkness deep'ning o'er the formless Walk.</L>
<L><PB N="139" REF="149"/>
<HI>Night</HI> treads not with light Step the dewy Gale,</L>
<L>Nor bright-distends her Star-embroider'd Veil;</L>
<L>Her leaden Feet inclement Damps distill,</L>
<L>Clouds shut her Face, black Winds her Vesture fill;</L>
<L>An Earth-born Meteor lights the sable Skies,</L>
<L>Eastward it shoots, and, sunk, forgotten dies.</L>
<L>So Pride, that rose from Dust to guilty Pow'r,</L>
<L>Glares out in vain, so Dust shall Pride devour.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fishers, who yonder Brink by Torches gain,</L>
<L>With teethful Tridents strike the scaly Train.</L>
<L>Like Snakes in Eagles' Claws, in vain they strive,</L>
<L>When heav'd aloft, and quiv'ring yet-alive.</L>

<LG>
<L>While here, methought, our Time in Converse pass'd,</L>
<L>The Moon Clouds muffl'd, and the Night wore fast.</L>
<L><PB N="140" REF="150"/>
At prowling Wolves was heard the Mastiff's Bay,</L>
<L>And the warn'd Master's Arms forbad the Prey.</L>
<L>Thus Treason steals, the Patriot thus descries,</L>
<L>Forth-springs the Monarch, and the Mischief flies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Pale Glow-worms glimmer'd thro' the Depth of Night,</L>
<L>Scatt'ring, like Hope thro' Fear, a doubtful Light.</L>
<L>Lone <HI>Philomela</HI> tun'd the silent Grove,</L>
<L>With pensive Pleasure listen'd wakeful <HI>Love.</HI></L>
<L>Half-dreaming <HI>Fancy</HI> form'd an Angel's Tongue,</L>

<L>The <HI>Night-Crone,</HI> with the Melody alarm'd,</L>
<L>Now paus'd, now listen'd, and awhile was charm'd;</L>
<L>But like the Man, whose frequent-stubborn Will</L>
<L>Resists what kind, seraphic Sounds instill;</L>
<L><PB N="141" REF="151"/>
Her Heart the Love-inspiring Voice repell'd,</L>
<L>Her Breast with agitating Mischief swell'd;</L>
<L>Which clos'd her Ear, and tempted to destroy</L>
<L>The tuneful Life, that charms with vertuous Joy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now fast we measure back the trackless Way;</L>
<L>No friendly Stars directive Beams display.</L>
<L>But, lo!—a thousand Lights shoot instant Rays!</L>
<L>Yon kindling Rock reflects the startling Blaze.</L>
<L>I stand astonish'd—thus the Hermit cries,</L>
<L>Fear not, but listen with enlarg'd Surprize!</L>
<L>Still, must these Hours our mutual Converse claim,</L>
<L>And cease to echo still <HI>Olympia</HI>'s Name?</L>
<L>Grots, Riv'lets, Groves <HI>Olympia</HI>'s Name forget,</L>
<L><HI>Olympia</HI> now no sighing Winds repeat.</L>
<L>Can I be mortal, and those Hours no more,</L>
<L>Those am'rous Hours, that plaintive Echo's bore?</L>
<L><PB N="142" REF="152"/>
Am I the same? Ah no!—Behold a Mind,</L>
<L>Unruffl'd, firm, exalted, and refin'd!</L>
<L>Late Months, that made the vernal Season gay,</L>
<L>Saw my Health languish off in pale Decay.</L>
<L>No racking Pain yet gave Disease a Date;</L>
<L>No sad, presageful Thought preluded Fate:</L>
<L>Yet number'd were my Days—My destin'd End</L>
<L>Near, and more near—Nay, ev'ry Fear suspend!</L>
<L>I pass'd a weary, ling'ring, sleepless Night;</L>
<L>Then rose, to walk in Morning's earliest Light:</L>
<L>But few my Steps—A faint, and chearless few!</L>
<L>Refreshment from my flagging Spirits flew.</L>
<L>When, lo! retir'd beneath a Cypress Shade,</L>
<L>My Limbs upon a flow'ry Bank I laid.</L>
<L>Soon by soft-creeping, murm'ring Winds compos'd,</L>
<L>A Slumber press'd my languid Eyes—they clos'd:</L>
<L><PB N="143" REF="153"/>
But clos'd not long,—methought <HI>Olympia</HI> spoke;</L>
<L>Thrice loud she call'd, and thrice the Slumber broke.</L>
<L>I wak'd. Forth-gliding from a neighb'ring Wood,</L>
<L>Full in my View the shad'wy Charmer stood.</L>
<L>Rapt'rous I started up to clasp the Shade;</L>
<L>But stagger'd, fell, and found my Vitals fade.</L>
<L>A mantling Chilness o'er my Bosom spread,</L>
<L>As if that Instant number'd with the Dead.</L>
<L>Her Voice now sent a far, imperfect Sound,</L>
<L>When in a swimming Trance my Pangs were drown'd.</L>
<L>Still farther off she call'd—with soft Surprize,</L>
<L>I turn'd,—but void of Strength, and Aid to rise;</L>
<L>Short, shorter, shorter yet, my Breath I drew:</L>
<L>Then up my struggling Soul unburthen'd flew.</L>
<L>Thus from a State, where Sin, and Grief abide,</L>
<L>Heav'n summon'd me to Mercy—thus I died.</L>
