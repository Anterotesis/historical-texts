RALPH ALDUS, Attorney at Law, WILLIAM AUGUSTUS MILES, JAMES SPARKS, and THOMAS LEIGH; FOR A RIOTOUS CONSPIRACY, FOUNDED In private premeditated Malice, to deprive CHARLES MACKLIN, one of the Comedians, belonging to the Theatre Royal in COVENT GARDEN, of his Livelihood; by forcibly compelling the acting Ma∣nager of the said Theatre, against his Will, to dis∣charge the said CHARLES MACKLIN for ever there-from; formally and publicly, on the Stage of the said Theatre.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS I consider myself (in the Meaning of my Motto) <HI>an humane Man, and that no Act of Humanity is a Stranger to my Heart;</HI> I could not resist a natural Impulse to publish the following Sheets; inasmuch as they will tend, I hope, wish, and believe, to re∣move the unjust Prejudices, that have been most wantonly and cruelly taken against a Man; and that too with an avowed Purpose, to re∣present him, as an <HI>"ancient outlawed Fe∣lon, who was said to have</HI> Caput lupinum, <HI>and might be knocked on the Head, like a Wolf, by any one who should meet him;</HI> because, <HI>having renounced all Law, he was to be dealt with, as in a State of Na∣ture, when any one, who should find him, might slay him."</HI></P>
<P>But as Mr. <HI>Macklin hath not re∣nounced all Law,</HI> and as <HI>"now (to avoid the Imputation of the Inhumanity above complained of) it is holden, that no Man can kill such Outlaw wantonly or wilful∣ly,"</HI> he seems as well intitled to the Protec∣tion of the Law of <HI>England,</HI> as any other liege Subject.</P>
<P><PB REF="4"/>
If it was high Treason against the Majesty of the <HI>PUBLIC,</HI> for a poor, ignorant, insulted Player, deluded, by mistaking a <HI>British</HI> Au∣dience, (from their Treatment of him) for Barbarians, hunting down a Beast of Prey, to become indignant, so indignant at such Treat∣ment, and at not being heard in his own De∣fence; and to happen to be so far lost, in an unguarded Moment, in such a Scene; as to express an improper and imprudent Agitation of Mind, by Looks or Gesture; if such De∣portment, in such a Situation, could, I say, be considered as high Treason; what must one think of Gentlemen, who, though liberally edu∣cated, and conversant in the Laws of their Country; yet, with these Advantages, and cool and dispassionate; after serious Reflection, and mature Consideration, should assert in the public Papers, that they had been <HI>"ill used, and robbed by Russians, Mr. Macklin's Friends, that they scarcely suffered them to escape with their Lives, and that Mr. Macklin was privy to the Cause of their Complaints;"</HI> and such malevolent Assertion be besides, unsupport∣ed either by Proof or Reason; but, on the contrary, alledged merely on <HI>own</HI> self-created
<PB REF="5"/>
Surmises, and the Charges made on Purpose to encrease the public Resentment against an unfor∣tunate and much injured Individual. If nothing but a Dismission from all Employment, an ut∣ter Deprivation of Bread, could atone for the <HI>Player</HI>'s presuming to doubt or disbelieve the equivocal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>I may</HI> safely <HI>swear in</HI> an extrajudicial <HI>Manner, (because no Perjury can be</HI> legally <HI>assigned on</HI> such false <HI>swearing) when I do not</HI> actually <HI>hiss, that</HI> I did not hiss; <HI>and I may as</HI> safely <HI>make a Noise so exactly similar to Hissing, in</HI> Point of Sound, <HI>as not to be distinguished from it; especially when such Attempt becomes necessary, for the Purpose of disturbing an Audience, distressing an Actor, answering a</HI> parti∣lar <HI>End, or making a News-Paper Affidavit; in short,</HI> qui vult decipi, decipiatur.</NOTE> Affidavits of two ingenious <HI>Par∣ticipes Criminis, solemnly</HI> declaring to the Public, that they did <HI>not hiss;</HI> What then, I say, can atone for <HI>Gentlemen</HI> riotously conspiring, (induced thereto from private premeditated Malice) to damn, without Re∣demption, an helpless, exposed Player, by Ac∣cusations of capital Felony, as false as they were public.</P>
<P><HI>Macklin</HI> was most grosly and inhumanly abused, insulted, and proscribed; and had it not been for the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> would have been totally ruined. To them he hath ap∣pealed;
<PB REF="6"/>
they have heard his Complaint, and declare him entitled to Relief.</P>
<P>The <HI>Town</HI> give out, that a Player hath dared to dispute the undoubted Right of a British Audience, founded on immemorial Custom, to approve or disapprove any Actor or theatrical Exhibition, by the usual Mode of Clapping or Hissing. The Charge is denied; and it is <HI>only</HI> humbly contended, that the meanest Subject, even a Player, a Servant of the Public, or a Vagabond (who being liable to Punishment, is also intitled to Protection) hath a legal Right to be heard against being for ever deprived of his Livelihood; though such At∣tempt were made by the first Personages in the Kingdom, or by Majesty itself (if that were possible) and that Riots, Conspiracies, and Malice, are all odious to, and punishable by the Spirit, as well as the Letter, of the Laws of <HI>England.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE EDITOR'S ADDRESS TO THE TOWN<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>The Reader will be pleased to observe, that I here speak of the</HI> Town, <HI>not of the</HI> Public; <HI>my opinion of whom is, that they are generous, candid, and me∣rit all the Submission, Respect, and Disposition to please them, which the Players profess every theatrical Evening, and that, not by</HI> sawning or cringing, <HI>but by a proper Demeanor, arising from a sincere, consci∣entious, and grateful Acknowledgment of the</HI> public <HI>Indulgence, Favor, and Protection.</HI></NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>THough I care not whether you approve this Publication or not, I have, however, been weak and foolish enough to endeavour to com∣mand your Attention. For, to address you in the Language of Friendship, you have ap∣propriated nothing but the Defects of for∣mer Times; Trifles light as Air amuse your Infancy; Passions distract your Youth; you think yourselves wise, when at Years of Ma∣turity, because your Folly then becomes more serious; and Dotage marks your old Age; you speak without Thinking, you act without Mean∣ing, and you assume the Authority to judge,
<PB REF="8"/>
because you have the Power to pronounce: To conclude, I respect you much, but esteem you very little; for tho' you require Notice, you are not worthy Regard. These are my Sentiments of you. If you require others,</P>

<HEAD>THE GENUINE ARGUMENTS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Trinity Term, 14 GEO. III. <HI>B. R.</HI> SATURDAY, June 11, 1774. THE KING, On the Prosecution of CHARLES MACKLIN, AGAINST JOHN STEPHEN JAMES, Esquire, and Others.</HEAD>
<P>THE Rule <HI>Nisi</HI> obtained in this Cause was read, and is as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<Q><P><HI>Monday</HI> next after <HI>five</HI> Weeks from the Feast Day of <HI>Easter,</HI> in the 14th Year of King <HI>George</HI> the Third.</P>

<P><HI>It is ordered,</HI> That the <HI>fifth</HI> Day of next Term, be pe∣remptorily further given to <HI>John Stephen James, Joseph Clarke,</HI> Esquires, <HI>Ralph Al∣dus,</HI> Gentleman; <HI>William Augustus Miles, Thomas Leigh,</HI> and <HI>James Sparks,</HI> to shew Cause, why an Information should not be exhibited a∣gainst

them, for certain Con∣spiracies, Riots, and Mis∣demeanors, upon the Under∣taking of the said Defend∣ants, that if such Informa∣tion should be granted, they will appear thereto immedi∣ately; and it is further <HI>or∣dered,</HI> that all Affidavits on Behalf of the said Defend∣ants, be filed four Days be∣fore the next Term.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Dunning.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Your Lordship is fully apprized of the Charge, and of the Na∣ture of the Answers, here are six De∣fendants, and six Council.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Mansfield.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I see they defend as not knowing each other, and taking the Charge separate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Serjeant <HI>Davy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It is so—and it is sworn in the Affidavits, they never saw one another, and were as much Strangers to one another, as I am to them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Mansfield.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>There is a Charge a∣gainst the Man who brought the Body into the House—Let him begin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Buller.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That Man was in <HI>Ireland</HI> at the Time the Rule was granted, and is not come back.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Mansfield.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Then he don't shew Cause; have they served him in <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Dunning</HI> to Mr. <HI>Buller.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You, upon his Behalf, then enlarged the Rule against him; it was enlarged upon his Behalf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Mansfield.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That is enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Buller.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I mentioned there being a Probability of his coming Home, and therefore I enlarged the Rule as to him, otherwise it would be impossible for him to appear, he being in <HI>Ireland</HI> long before the Rule obtained it was a Slip—There is an Affidavit of his then being in <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Mansfield.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Buller</HI> says it was a Slip, if it was enlarged; as he had then an Affidavit, that <HI>Leigh</HI> was in <HI>Ireland,</HI> at the Time the Rule was granted; what do you say to that Mr. <HI>Dunning?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Dunning.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, I am not sa∣tisfied there was any such Slip—I am not satisfied there was any such Affidavit—If your Lordship observes, the Rule was enlarged by Mr. <HI>Wallace</HI> for three, he being Council now for one; and it was enlarged by Mr. <HI>Buller</HI> for three, he being now likewise for one; at that Time there was no Distinction made between them; the Rule was to be enlarged for all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Mansfield</HI> to Mr. <HI>Buller.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You must bring an Affidavit of the Fact, and make a special Case to have it argued, why this general Rule should not prevail against <HI>Leigh</HI> among the rest?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Butler.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>There is no Affidavit of Service upon him—they could not serve him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Mansfield.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Then why did you enlarge the Rule?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Serjeant <HI>Davy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I had no Brief in the Business, at the Time the Gentlemen
<PB N="5" REF="13"/>
refer to—In the last Term I had a Brief brought me, to shew Cause for <HI>Leigh</HI> and <HI>Sparks</HI>—I was astonished to find, when I had read it quite through, that there was nothing said of Mr. <HI>Leigh,</HI> or on his Be∣half, as there was an Affidavit by his Wife of his Absence—Upon looking into the Rule, and finding it enlarged generally, I enquired, and did not understand any Body was particularly Council for <HI>Leigh,</HI> at the Time the Rule was enlarged.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Davenport.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wallace</HI> enlarged the Rule to this Term, for <HI>Miles, Clarke</HI> and <HI>Aldus;</HI> and Mr. <HI>Buller</HI> for <HI>Leigh, Sparks</HI> and <HI>James.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Mansfield.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It certainly was so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Buller.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>We can prove it was a Mistake—A Slip.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Dunning.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I apprehend it was no Mistake of Mr. <HI>Buller's,</HI> but of the In∣structions brought to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Mansfield.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>He must have had In∣structions to enlarge the Rule, as to those three.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Dunning.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I heard Mr. Serjeant <HI>Davy</HI> say just now, that his Brief instructs him to defend <HI>Leigh</HI> and <HI>Sparks.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="14"/>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Blake.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I sent a Letter to Mr. <HI>Leigh</HI> to inform him of it, he has not re∣turned me an Answer—I have an Affida∣vit of his being out of the Kingdom, be∣fore the Rule was granted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Macklin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, That <HI>Leigh</HI> was in <HI>London</HI> when the Rule was served can be proved.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Blake.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>We will put the whole upon that Mr. <HI>Macklin,</HI> if you please.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Dunning.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> will be so good as to recollect where we are—Your Lordship sees what a Situation we should have been in—we should have lost the Vacation, which might have been employ∣ed in serving him—the enlarging the Rule upon his Behalf, subjects him to stand this Day and shew Cause; and if what has been already done is not to be taken for Servic, he never will be served.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Mansfield.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>They don't deny it was enlarged with regard to him, and meant to be enlarged upon his Part. Mr. <HI>Buller</HI> says candidly and fairly, he thought <HI>Leigh</HI> would have been over, and that he got it enlarged upon that Supposition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Serjeant <HI>Davy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly I can shew no Cause for <HI>Leigh.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="15"/>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Mansfield.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Are you all afraid of beginning, can't you agree who shall be∣gin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Bearcroft.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, I am not a∣fraid to begin for Mr. <HI>James,</HI> the first in the Rule—In Point of Form, I ought to begin—In Point of Substance, I ought to be the last; for Mr. <HI>James</HI> has very little to do in this Business, in Proportion with some of the rest; but as he is brought upon the Stage in this Character by Mr. <HI>Macklin,</HI> he must perform his Part, and when the Court come to see his Behavi∣our, if they don't dismiss him with Ap∣plause, they will dismiss him at least with∣out any Censure.—In order to understand Mr. <HI>James'</HI> Case, (since Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI>'s Af∣fidavits have not been read) it is neces∣sary for me shortly to state what they con∣tain upon this Charge, and it is material to attend to the particular Times, in which <HI>James</HI> is charged to be active in this Bu∣siness. Mr. <HI>Macklin,</HI> and his Friend Mr. <HI>Kavenhuller Skinner</HI> say, that upon the 13th of <HI>November</HI> last, Mr. <HI>James,</HI> toge∣ther with Mr. <HI>Aldus</HI> an Attorney at Law, was very violent, at the Head of a Party,
<PB N="8" REF="16"/>
in the two Shilling Gallery of <HI>Covent Gar∣den</HI> Theatre; that they and their Party were the chief Persons who made the Disturb∣ance; and there is this particular Charge against <HI>James,</HI> that he insisted a Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> one of the Actors of the said Theatre, should perform the Part of <HI>Macbeth,</HI> which was to have been exhibited that Evening. Then Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> and Mr. <HI>Skinner</HI> say likewise, that upon the 18th of said <HI>No∣vember</HI> Mr. <HI>James</HI> appeared again at the said Theatre, in Concert with Mr. <HI>Aldus</HI> and Mr. <HI>Miles,</HI> in Consequence of a Conspiracy together, and that they made a violent Riot; and it is expressly charged that <HI>James,</HI> among others, called upon Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> to kneel down upon the Stage, and ask Pardon,—These are the Charges against Mr. <HI>James,</HI> for whom I am concerned, with some general Alle∣gations to inflame; and Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> asserts in his Affidavit, that he, believes the sole Cause of his Discharge from the Theatre, was occasioned by, and owing to these riotous Proceedings. I have an Affidavit of Mr. <HI>James,</HI> which, if I am not very much mistaken, to∣tally
<PB N="9" REF="17"/>
exculpates him from any Thing of the Sort, charged By the Information in this Cause—though perhaps Mr. <HI>James</HI> was not so perfectly quiet, as he could now wish he had been, yet your Lordships will find, upon his Affidavit, that he did nothing more than is done every Day, when an Auditor does not like an Actor—he tells, you he was there, when Mr. <HI>Mack∣lin</HI> himself does not introduce him—he has no Reluctance in telling how often he attended the Exhibition of <HI>Macbeth,</HI> and the whole of his Conduct while there—he tells your Lordship, that he went there upon the 6th of said <HI>November,</HI> when he is not charged with being there—he says he went in Company with his Wife, that may satisfy your Lordship, he meant to be quiet, for to procure Quiet at Home, he took his Wife with him, and went into the two Shilling Gallery; he did not mean to make a Riot, having his Wife with him; and it might be well if every Person's Wife was as quiet as Mr. <HI>James</HI>'s. But your Lordship will find there was another lady, a Lady <HI>Macbeth,</HI> who was not so quiet in this Business, for she thought pro∣per
<PB N="10" REF="18"/>
to act in the Character, her Husband was that Night to perform, therefore she was not quite so quiet—and her Husband, instead of performing the Cha∣racter of <HI>Macbeth,</HI> chose to exhibit a great Part of his own Character.—Instead of going on with the Play, he produced a vast Number of News Papers, with which he was disposed to act his Part in the Cause, and appealing to them was his Method of acting, till Mr. <HI>Dun∣ning</HI> took the Character from him, who will act much better for him, if he will let him alone; thus the Cause was taken from the Audience, which seemed to be an Accusation thrown out against <HI>Macklin</HI> of saying, that a Mr. <HI>Reddish</HI> had hissed him; it seems Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> appeal∣ed to the News Papers, and charged Mr. <HI>Reddish</HI> and Mr. <HI>Sparks</HI> with having hissed him. This Charge Mr. <HI>Reddish</HI> and the other denied in the public Papers, by Af∣fidavits sworn before my Lord Mayor, or some Justice of the Peace. Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> was angry, that he had thrown out a false Charge, and in order to exculpate him∣self was prepared with Papers, when he
<PB N="11" REF="19"/>
came upon the Stage, and was going to enter upon his Exculpation, and that pro∣duced the first Riot.—Most of the Au∣dience disapproved of Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI>'s Pro∣ceedings in this Business, and tho' it was his own Appeal to the Public, yet he did not chuse to have Mr. <HI>James</HI> and the o∣thers shew their Disapprobation by Hissing, which is the usual manner upon such Ap∣plications, either Hissing or Clapping; that was all that passed upon the 6th of <HI>November;</HI> then upon the 13th, the Time when it is charged, that Mr. <HI>James</HI> was at the Theatre, the Question then arose, whether Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> had not been ex∣tremely wrong in this false Charge upon Mr. <HI>Reddish</HI> and others, and it was the Judgment of the House that he had, and Mr. <HI>James</HI> was in Truth one of those judges who was of Opinion it was impro∣per Behaviour, and Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> was cal∣led upon for some Concessions, for that he had been in the wrong.—Mr. <HI>James</HI> says he sat in the two Shilling Gallery, and that he, with the rest, called out for a Concession, for this bad Behaviour of <HI>Macklin</HI>'s, which he had no sooner done, than a Lady, who sat some little Distance
<PB N="12" REF="20"/>
from him, started up and immediately struck Mr. <HI>James</HI>—This Signal it seems was to be given, together with the Ex∣pression the Lady made use of, <HI>"this is one of the Scoundrels who hissed,"</HI> or to that Effect, upon which a Man started up and seconded the Lady, being close by her, and immediately struck Mr. <HI>James;</HI> upon this a Scuffle and a third Person arose, and struck Mr. <HI>James;</HI> this seems to be rather unfortunate for Mr. <HI>James,</HI> for if he did wrong, he was very well punished upon the Spot, without having the Punishment of this Court—they tumbled him between two Benches, and one or two got upon him, and beat him: Your Lordship may conceive the Consequences might have been very serious to him—He says, he had a Suspicion who this Virago Lady, that be∣gun the Business, was, he supposed her to be a Relation of Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI>'s, and he defined a Friend of his, who appeared in the Gallery, to follow this Lady Home, to see who she was; he found out the House she went to, which had the Name <HI>Macklin</HI> upon the Door. Every one be∣lieves the Lady, who begun this Assault
<PB N="13" REF="21"/>
upon Mr. <HI>James,</HI> was Mrs. <HI>Macklin,</HI> Wife of Mr. <HI>Macklin,</HI> who makes this Applica∣tion. The present Question is, whether or no there was a concerted Design and Conspiracy between these Parties to hurt Mr. <HI>Macklin.</HI> This would be a bad Bu∣siness indeed, and every Person must feel it so.—But Mr. <HI>James</HI> denies the Charge in these Terms, <HI>viz.</HI> that he had not the least Knowledge before of Mr. <HI>Aldus,</HI> or any of the rest, and absolutely denies, that he called upon Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> to perform in the Character of <HI>Macbeth,</HI> instead of Mr. <HI>Macklin,</HI> or for any Purpose whatsoever—and though Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> has been too hot and hasty in charging Mr. <HI>James</HI> with making use of those Expressions, they are material Expressions perhaps, and mate∣rial to be denied, for they enter into the very Purpose, supposed to be a Preface to the Proceedings of the rest of these Per∣sons, by calling upon Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> to per∣form the Part of <HI>Macbeth;</HI> this he fully denies.—He is charged with hissing, hooting, and abusing every Person near him; but he puts a Negative upon this by his Affidavit, wherein he shews the
<PB N="14" REF="22"/>
Usage he received from the Hands of Mrs. <HI>Macklin</HI> and her Friends.—He says, the next Morning he waited upon Mr. <HI>Cole∣man,</HI> the acting Manager of the Playhouse, to procure an Interview with Mr. <HI>Mack∣lin,</HI> in order to find out from whom he received those Blows; that he did not mean to prosecute, with respect to her, but would put up with the Blows he received from her. Mr. <HI>Coleman</HI> took a great deal of Pains to procure a Meeting between <HI>Macklin</HI> and <HI>James,</HI> to have the Matter explained. But your Lordship will find that was diligently avoided by Mr. <HI>Mack∣lin,</HI> tho' he had full Notice.—Now supposing for a Moment, that Mr. <HI>James</HI> himself was at all to blame, will your Lordship grant an Information upon the Application of this Mr. <HI>Macklin,</HI> from whose Wife and two of his Friends (for those Men must be taken for his Friends) if Mr. <HI>James</HI> had behaved at all ill, he receiv'd ample Punishment from their Hands, such as I have before represented; and when Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> refused to meet him or to assist him in his Enquiry after these Persons. I should submit, that would be
<PB N="15" REF="23"/>
a Ground for refusing this Information to Mr. <HI>Macklin.</HI> The Court requires, when an Application is made to them for an In∣formation, for a Riot or a Breach of the Peace, or other bad Behaviour, that there should be nothing of the Sort on the Part of the Person who makes the Applica∣tion. Another Charge against Mr. <HI>James</HI> is, that he roared out for Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> to kneel down upon his Knees, and that he menaced Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> with his Stick or Cane; that is a material Charge, and material to be denied, that is denied in the fullest Manner in the World. He absolutely denies in Words, that he roared out to Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> to down upon his Knees, or menaced Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> with his Stick, as charged in the Affidavit—for Deponent positively swears he had no Stick or Cane whatever with him that Evening; that is material, the Truth is no more than this; they must have taken some other Person to be him—Now with respect to the Conspiracy between these Parties, to do the Mischief, which is the material Part, there is the most absolute and positive Denial that can be in any
<PB N="16" REF="24"/>
Form of Words—Mr. <HI>James</HI> says, he was there upon the 18th of <HI>November,</HI> that he was a perfect Stranger to <HI>William Au∣gustus Miles, James Sparks, Joseph Clarke, Ralph Aldus,</HI> and <HI>Thomas Leigh,</HI> or any or either of them, to drive the said Mr. <HI>Mack∣lin</HI> from the Stage, nor had any Meeting with any Person or Persons whatever for that Purpose, nor desired any Person to expell the said <HI>Macklin</HI> from the Stage—All this Deponent wanted was for him to answer for his Conduct relating to those Charges against Mr. <HI>Reddish</HI> and Mr. <HI>Sparks,</HI> and that was the whole of the Business, and denies that he was in any Conspiracy, or knew of any Conspiracy against Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI>—That with respect to himself, he has been sufficiently ill used, and more than sufficiently punished at the Time, through the Behaviour of the Wife of Mr. <HI>Macklin,</HI> for if there was any Cause of Revenge, she and her two As∣sistants fully revenged the Cause, while my Client was down between the two Benches; therefore, my Lord, I conceive this is a full Answer to the Charge, and that your Lordship will not make the Rule absolute against Mr. <HI>James.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Mr. JAMES's Affidavit read in Court.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Affidavit of JOHN STEPHEN JAMES, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> sworn the 28th of <HI>May,</HI> 1774.</HEAD>
<P>SAITH, That on the 6th of <HI>No∣vember</HI> last, to the best of Depo∣nent's Knowledge and Belief, as to the Time, Deponent went in Company with his Wife to Covent Garden The∣atre, to see the Tragedy of <HI>Macbeth,</HI> wherein Mr. <HI>Charles Macklin</HI> was to perform the Part of <HI>Macbeth,</HI> being the third Time of his appearing in that Character; saith, They were in the two Shilling Gallery, and that before the be∣ginning of the Play Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> came on the Stage, with a large Parcel of Papers in his Hands, which he began to read, the Purport of which was to prove, that Mr. <HI>Reddish</HI> and Mr. <HI>Sparks</HI> had hissed him the first Night of his performing said Part of <HI>Macbeth;</HI> saith, That on hearing same read, it appeared to Deponent, that there was no sufficient Proof of either said <HI>Red∣dish</HI> or <HI>Sparks</HI> hissing, neither did De∣ponent
<PB N="18" REF="26"/>
think a mere Relation sufficient to contradict the Oaths of said <HI>Reddish</HI> and <HI>Sparks,</HI> which they had respectively made, denying that said <HI>Reddish</HI> had hissed on the 23d of <HI>October;</HI> Copies whereof were inserted in the News Pa∣pers, and Deponent did therefore dis∣approve of said <HI>Macklin</HI>'s Behaviour, by the common Mode of Hissing, and faith nothing more particular passed that Evening, and the Play was heard through, during the Performance of which Deponent applauded or hissed, as he approved or disapproved.</P>
<P>Saith, That on 13th of same <HI>No∣vember</HI> Deponent went to said Thea∣tre, to see the Tragedy of <HI>Macbeth,</HI> be∣ing the fourth Time of Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI>'s performing said Character, and sat in the two Shilling Gallery; saith, that as said <HI>Macklin</HI> had not produced the positive Proof of <HI>Reddish</HI> and <HI>Spark</HI>'s hissing, as he pledged himself to the Public to do Deponent, as well as many others, call'd out for such Proof or a Concession. And saith, that on his calling out for such Proof or Concession, a Woman
<PB N="19" REF="27"/>
some little Distance from Deponent, started up and struck Deponent, and said, <HI>"This is one of the Scoundrels who hissed,"</HI> or used Words to that Effect; on which a Man, who appear∣ed to be sitting next her, immediately started up, and also struck Deponent, who returned his Blows, and continued so to do, till his Companions took him away.</P>
<P>Saith, That some little Time after said Fray happened, but during the Performance of said Play, as Deponent was endeavouring to find out said Man who had struck him, a Gentleman, whom Deponent has not the least Knowledge of, pointed out the Man, who had struck him, and told Depo∣nent, if he was looking for the Man who had struck him, that was him, or Words to that Effect; saith, upon his going up to the said Person who had so struck him, another Man immediate∣ly rose up and struck Deponent, which Blow was followed by several others, from several persons who were sitting near said Man, who had first struck
<PB N="20" REF="28"/>
Deponent, and Deponent was knocked down between the two Benches, and some Person or Persons stamped on De∣ponent's Breast, and other Parts of his Body; and saith, if his Friends who went with him, and some other Gen∣tlemen, had not interposed and pre∣vented said Persons from continuing their ill Usage to him, the Consequence would have proved very dangerous to Deponent.</P>
<P>Saith, that immediately after he had been so released from the disagreeable Situation he was in between the two Benches, he went into the Passage of the said Gallery, where he was addressed by a Gentleman, who informed him he was a Patentee of said Theatre (and whom Deponent believes, and has been since informed, was Mr. <HI>Dagge</HI>) and desired Deponent to give him his Ad∣dress, which Deponent did, and then said he had heard Deponent had been used very ill, and pointed to a Person, who he said was the Constable of the Theatre, and had Orders from him to take out any Person or Persons, whom
<PB N="21" REF="29"/>
Deponent should fix on, who had used him ill.</P>
<P>Saith, he then went into the Gallery, with the Constable, to search for the first Man who had struck Deponent, but could not find him; and on his coming into the Gallery, with the Constable, he observed the Woman who had struck him rising from her Seat to go out, and as Deponent was following her, with a View of finding out who she was, De∣ponent met Mr. <HI>Lucas</HI> of <HI>Charing Cross,</HI> who was then coming into the Gallery, on which Deponent desired Mr. <HI>Lucas</HI> to watch said Woman Home, which he accordingly did, and said <HI>Lucas</HI> re∣turned to said Theatre in about twenty Minutes, and informed Deponent, that he had followed her into a House in <HI>James Street, Covent Garden,</HI> with the Name of <HI>Macklin</HI> on the Door, and therefore Deponent at that Time verily believed, and doth now believe, that said Woman who struck Deponent first, and whom said <HI>Lucas</HI> followed to said House, on the Door of which House was wrote <HI>Macklin,</HI> to be Mrs. <HI>Macklin,</HI> Wife of said <HI>Charles Macklin;</HI></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="30"/>
Saith, that being so ill used in the Theatre, he was obliged to quit same during the Time the fifth Act was per∣forming.</P>
<P>Denies being at the Head of, or form∣ing any Party or Parties against Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI>'s performing said Character of <HI>Macbeth,</HI> on said 13th <HI>November,</HI> and absolutely denies having at that Time the least Knowledge of Mr. <HI>Ralph Aldus;</HI> and also denies, that he called on Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> to play said Character of <HI>Macbeth,</HI> instead of said <HI>Macklin,</HI> or for any other Purpose whatsoever; and also denies, that he hissed, hooted, or abused those, who desired him to be quiet.</P>
<P>Saith, that on the <HI>Monday</HI> Morning following, he waited on Mr. <HI>Coleman,</HI> the acting Manager of the said Thea∣tre, to request of him to use his Influ∣ence, to obtain an Interview with Mr. <HI>Macklin,</HI> in order to prevail on Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> to use his utmost Endeavours to find out the several Persons, who used Deponent ill the preceding Night; that Mr. <HI>Coleman</HI> sent his Servant to said <HI>Macklin,</HI> to obtain such Interview,
<PB N="23" REF="31"/>
which Servant brought back for An∣swer, that said <HI>Macklin</HI> was not at Home; that said <HI>Coleman</HI> promised Deponent to speak to <HI>Macklin,</HI> and to procure a Meeting with him, and that he would give Deponent Notice of such Meeting; that in the Evening of same Day, he received a Note from Mr. <HI>Coleman,</HI> in∣forming him, that soon after Deponent left said <HI>Coleman</HI>'s House said <HI>Macklin</HI> came, and refused to have any Meeting or Conversation with Deponent on the Subject; in which said Note from <HI>Cole∣man</HI> to Deponent, was inclosed one from <HI>Macklin</HI> to <HI>Coleman,</HI> informing said <HI>Coleman,</HI> that said <HI>Macklin</HI> refused to meet Deponent.</P>
<P>Saith, that on or about 17th of said <HI>November,</HI> Deponent did cause to be inserted in the Morning Chronicle, a Letter addressed to said <HI>Macklin,</HI> in the Words following (that is to say)</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I call upon you thus publicly to declare your Reasons, for refusing to meet me, at Mr. <HI>Coleman</HI>'s or elsewhere, as likewise who the Gentlewoman is, who first

struck, and then set a Russian to assault me, on <HI>Saturday</HI> Evening last, in the Gallery of <HI>Covent Garden,</HI> she being af∣terwards watched into your House, in <HI>James Street, Covent Garden:</HI> This I must insist upon, as I intend then to leave you to the Stings of your own ma∣levolent Heart, and the Resentment of the much abused Public.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, Sir, Your very humble Servant, J. S. JAMES.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Saith, that said <HI>Macklin</HI> took no kind of Notice of said Letter, either in a public or private manner, and saith, that receiving no Answer from Mr. <HI>Macklin,</HI> he went to said Theatre on the 18th of said <HI>November,</HI> with two Gen∣tlemen only, who had dined with him that Day, at his Lodgings in <HI>Bridge Street,</HI> and went into the Pit, with an Intent to see the Play of the Merchant of <HI>Venice,</HI> in which Play said <HI>Macklin,</HI> was to perform the Part of <HI>Shylock,</HI> and, likewise publicly to repeat the Question to <HI>Macklin,</HI> whether he knew the Wo∣man or Man who struck Deponent on
<PB N="25" REF="33"/>
13th <HI>November</HI> in the two Shilling Gal∣lery as aforesaid; but the Confusion and Noise on <HI>Macklin</HI>'s Appearance on the Stage, Deponent presumes prevented said <HI>Macklin</HI> from hearing said Question.</P>
<P>Positively denies, that he roared out to <HI>Macklin,</HI> to down on his Knees, or that he menaced said <HI>Macklin</HI> with his Stick, for he had no Stick or Cane of any kind whatsoever with him, during that Even∣ing; and saith, that on 18th <HI>November</HI> last, he was a perfect Stranger to <HI>Miles, Sparks, Leigh,</HI> any or either of them, and never had any Conversation with all or any of them, or with <HI>Clarke</HI> or <HI>Aldus,</HI> or either of them, to drive said <HI>Macklin</HI> off the Stage, nor did Deponent enter into any Combination, Conspiracy, or Agreement with any Persons whomsoever, for that Purpose; nor did Deponent say or ex∣press any Desire t expel said <HI>Macklin</HI> from the Stage, for all that Deponent wanted was an Answer to his Question, and an Apology for said <HI>Macklin</HI>'s Conduct towards the said <HI>Reddish</HI> and <HI>Sparks.</HI></P>

<P>My Lord, I am of Council likewise on the Part of Mr. <HI>James;</HI> the only positive Charge is, that on the 18th of <HI>November</HI> last, he stood up in the Pit and with Vociferations called to Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> to kneel down, and menaced hin with a Stick; as to the rest, respecting the Charge upon the former Day, it only ex∣tends to Belief: Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> has sworn and upon his Belief refers to another Fact which really is not so, as in the Affidvit it appears to be sworn, by another Per∣son's Affidavit, that <HI>James</HI> insisted tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Smith</HI> should take Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI>'s Par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI>'s Affidavit does not say, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>James</HI> was the Man who called upon Mr▪ <HI>Smith</HI> to act Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI>'s Part; and then is no other express Charge, but that on th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 18th of <HI>November,</HI> against <HI>James,</HI> which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his calling out to Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> to knee
<PB N="27" REF="35"/>
down, and the menacing him with a Stick or Cane. All the rest of the Affidavit is nothing to Mr. <HI>James,</HI> the greatest Part of it is only setting out Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI>'s Merit. Mr. <HI>James</HI> appears from the first Time to be insulted by People who came there, and the Woman who first began the Disturbance, was traced to Mr. <HI>Mack∣lin</HI>'s House; he had Notice, and was cal∣led upon to give an Account, if he knew who the Persons were who had used <HI>James</HI> so ill—But what was Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI>'s Con∣duct: he refuses to meet him, and gives no Anwer whatsoever, which was not an implicit reason, that he did not know who they were; if he did not know who they were, as I think he must know, he might have so informed Mr. <HI>James,</HI> but he had reason to suspect who they were. Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> is said to have first appealed to the Public; I should have thought his Discretion would have dictated to him to abide by their Opinion, let it be what it would; but with respect to his pre∣sent Application to a Court of Justice, he is not intitled to the least Fa∣vour or Countenance whatsoever; for he
<PB N="28" REF="36"/>
brought his Complaint in the most public and solemn Manner he could, against two People in the same Profession with him∣self, and which Complaint, if proved must have been attended with all the fatal Consequences to those two Gentlemen that <HI>Macklin</HI> seems to apprehend now the Complaint was made by him to the Audience, they heard it with Patience the Complaint they found was not true but appeared to be false; I don't know any more generous Conduct for any Man to have adopted upon this Occasion, where there was a false Charge brought against two Men, which, as public Men, must have been attended with very injurious Consequences to those Gentlemen, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> found true, than where it was found false to express Horror upon the Occasion It appears, that all that Mr. <HI>James</HI> desired was to have an Account of those People who had used him ill; <HI>James</HI> had shew his own Opinion, which he had a righ to maintain, and he was justified in Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦sing to shew his Disapprobation; for whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this Motion was first made, before it was furbished up with this Ground of Con∣spiracy,
<PB N="29" REF="37"/>
which has been since added, at that Time the Court said there was no Ground for an Information. Now they have foisted in the Ground of Conspiracy, which they have not made out. It is denied, in the most positive Terms, respecting the Stick being held up in the Pit; it is de∣nied, in the most positive Terms, that <HI>James</HI> knew any thing of the other De∣fendants; upon the contrary he went as a single Man, neither has he entered into any Conspiracy or Combination whatever. Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> might have put an end to it, if he pleased, even after his having made his Appeal to the Public, in the Manner he did; when he was called upon by Mr. <HI>James,</HI> he might have answered him, by giving him an Account of those Persons from whom he had suffered so much, when he was knocked down between the Benches, where he was kicked and stamp∣ed upon, which might have been attended with fatal Consequences to his Person; but when called upon, Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> re∣fuses to give him any Answer, or meet him.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="38"/>
Upon the whole it appears there is no kind of Conspiracy in the Conduct of Mr. <HI>James,</HI> and therefore no Ground for this Information.</P>

<P>Will the Court give Judgment one by one?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Dunning.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and execute them one by one. If your Lordships please to favour me a few Words upon this Case, so far as the Rule affects the Person, for whom the two Gentlemen have been shewing Cause: Your Lordship will recol∣lect, what has been stated from the Affida∣vits, containing that Charge which is sup∣ported, not by Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> only, but in the material Parts of it, by two or three other People, Mr. <HI>Macdonnel</HI> and his Wife, and Mr. <HI>Kavenhuller Skinner.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Bullet</HI> thought good to suppose these People did not swear positively to the Fact, or at all to it, and that <HI>Macklin</HI> speaks to Belief only of the Facts that passed on the 13th of <HI>November</HI> last. Your Lordship, by referring to those Affidavits, will cor∣rect that Misinformation; for nothing can
<PB N="31" REF="39"/>
be more positive to the Facts sworn to, by the Affidavits, of those people, whose Information Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> speaks. Of the Facts sworn to upon the 13th of No∣vember last, <HI>Macdonnel</HI> and his Wife give this Account; that one of <HI>"the Persons who seemed to be at the Head of those who opposed</HI> Macklin's <HI>performing the Character of</HI> Macbeth, <HI>and spoke most particularly, was one</HI> James—<HI>as he called himself, whom they believed to be</HI> John Stephen James, <HI>of</HI> Bridge Street, Westminster, <HI>said</HI> James <HI>so publicly declaring;"</HI> these Mr. <HI>Buller</HI> thought good to represent to your Lord∣ship, as Persons speaking from Informa∣tion and Belief, and to suppose Mr. <HI>Mack∣lin</HI> spoke from Information and Belief respecting the Person; it is charged to be <HI>James</HI> by <HI>Macdonnel</HI> and his Wife, but their Affidavit hardly wants Positiveness, in the manner of making it, three People swear positively, Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> making the fourth—Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> believes <HI>James</HI> to be the Person from whom he received that Treatment, and the Reason for his believ∣ing it is, he has been fo informed by those, who now prove it, concurring with his own Apprehensions.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="40"/>
The Court will now say what is fit to be done upon the Truth of the Case, when the Truth is understood; Mr. <HI>Buller</HI> thought good, as did Mr. <HI>Bearcroft,</HI> who went before him, to say Mr. <HI>Macklin,</HI> who gave certain Provocations, which, by their Argument, they would refer to him, in Consequence of which Mr. <HI>James,</HI> was intitled to act in the manner he did, and was not so culpable as the rest, he having received very ill Treatment from the Hands of a Woman, and some Friends of Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI>'s. If your Lordship looks at the Affidavit of the Gentleman, in his own Exculpation, and of Mr. <HI>Lucas,</HI> your Lordship will see upon what Ground these People were warranted, in presum∣ing that this Woman was Mrs. <HI>Macklin.</HI> The Ground is this; by the Directions of <HI>James, Lucas</HI> followed this Woman to the House, upon the Door of which, was the Name of <HI>Macklin;</HI> Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> lives in that House, Part of which belongs to him, upon the Door of which, leading to his Apartments, is his Name, the other Part of it is a Shop; in the House there are various Lodgers, and to what Part of the
<PB N="33" REF="41"/>
Hoause she went, they have hot thought proper to tell; she might go to a Lodger there, or might be a Lodger herself; or possibly never heard or knew any thing at all of Mr. <HI>Macklin,</HI> otherwise than as being a Lodger in the House; and disposed to think Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> was ill treated. But of this Woman being Mrs. <HI>Macklin,</HI> there is no Evidence, nor do they affect to say she is in any Way so, as to induce your Lordship to credit, that such is their Belief. Your Lordship will give me Leave to say, that this Woman, so said to be Mrs. <HI>Macklin</HI> by Mr. <HI>James,</HI> was not Mrs. <HI>Macklin,</HI> and it was so far from being possible for <HI>James</HI> so to believe her, that he charged a Woman of the Name of <HI>Macdonnel</HI> with being the Wo∣man who had so treated him; he Mr. <HI>James</HI> therefore, so far from being of that Belief, stands under the Predicament of having found out his Mistake, if ever there was a Time, that he really thought so, for this same Mrs. <HI>Macdonnel</HI> is the same Person he fixed upon, as having given him that Usage, and is not Mrs. <HI>Macklin,</HI> out Mrs. <HI>Macdonnel,</HI> a Person who has
<PB N="34" REF="42"/>
nothing to do with it, but the Fact of being a Witness in this Case; all the Ar∣gument founded upon it will be removed, by shewing there is such a Misrepresenta∣tion. Then my Lord it remains to shew, that the Charge is neither disputed or de∣nied; I take Leave to say so, notwith∣standing the Gentlemen have said it is both disputed and denied; these Facts, supposing them to be true, constitute the Ground of the Charge against this Person.</P>
<P>Your Lordship will give me Leave to presume that, of which these is undoubt∣ed Evidence, and which no Person is prepared to controvert, <HI>viz.</HI> with re∣spect to the enlarging of the Rule for Mr. <HI>Leigh,</HI> Mr. <HI>Buller</HI> was not ill ad∣vised, it was not a Slip upon the Occa∣sion, though the Gentleman says so, but he has it from the Attorney, giving him Instructions to enlarge it, without which he would not have enlarged it, therefore it was no Mistake of Instructions, but the Gentleman acted agreeable to the Point of his Instructions; the Attor∣ney, in my Apprehension, perfectly un∣derstood
<PB N="35" REF="43"/>
what he was about, when he gave those Instructions; I now, understand it, and if the Gentleman had not advised he should be defended, they would have given him better Instructions. Nobody will doubt the Charge, when there is a Proof of a great Number of People, speaking at a great Number of Times and Places, about it; and Mr. <HI>Leigh</HI> has been seen to give Orders, and to apply that Force, and collect it, which will clearly be found to be the Truth; and when not denied, it must be taken for granted; and if that Time never comes of its being denied, it appears in Proof beyond a Doubt, there existed in Somebody a determined Purpose to drive this Man from the Stage; and though the Gentleman chose to speak of Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI>'s Apprehensions being groundless, Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> at that Time, as well as the Time I am now pressing his Interest for the Consideration of the Court, if he was in a Situation to apprehend any thing, must apprehend he would be dis∣charged; and now that he has been dis∣charged, if he is not apprehensive of being discharged, it is certain he is not
<PB N="36" REF="44"/>
yet restored, and not under the Appre∣hension he shall be restored. With res∣pect to their own Safety, for which no Imputation falls upon them, if the Ma∣nagers of the Theatre attend to such Be∣haviour as this, it will for ever prevent the Restitution and Restoration of this Man, to what the People have driven him from. That some People are answerable for that, I beg Leave to presume, in this Business; how far those People are accessary to that Design, and instrumental in carrying it in∣to Execution, and for the Purpose of ob∣viating the Suspicion of Collusion and Conspiracy, the Circumstances are singu∣lar enough. When I state Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> to be an Irishman, he will not be affronted with me, what those others are I cannot learn; I have not made any Inquiry about it; but I find a little <HI>Irish</HI> Blood has found its Way into their Veins, or those that advise or appear for them to Day; when the Rule was enlarged, they appeared by two distinct Classes of Council, each re∣presenting Three, and to Day the Partie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are Six, and have six Council; and the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

they forget there stands my Friend, the common Attorney to the whole Six.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Blake.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It is not so; I am not At∣torney for the Six, I am Attorney for Mr. <HI>Leigh;</HI> and Mr. <HI>James</HI>'s Friend desired me to do Business for him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Dunning.</HI></SPEAKER>

<P>Then I beg Leave to stand again to rectify my Mistake; we shall grow accurate, by Degrees, no doubt; then there is one Attorney for three Par∣ties, represented by three Council; and three Attorneys instructing another Coun∣cil, to be for the three other Parties. The corrected Case then is this; three Attorneys employ one Council, upon the Behalf of three Parties, who choose to be understood, as Parties entirely unconnect∣ed with each other; another Attorney em∣ploys three distinct Council, representing three Parties, because they chuse to shew

those three Parties totally unconnected with each other; therefore, as far as res∣pects the Point of Connection, is to be dis∣covered by the <HI>Evidentia rei</HI> of the Case, which your Lordship sees, with respect to Mr. <HI>James,</HI> the present Subject in Consi∣deration, is, that he is understood by his Council, to have acquitted himself alto∣gether; and they have gone particularly through the Charge, in Point of Obser∣vation, in order to contradict it.—Give me Leave to go through the Parts of the Answer; in the first Place, your Lordships are told, that this Gentleman went to the Theatre, for the peaceable Purpose of see∣ing the Play; perhaps if he had been so very peaceable as my learned Friend, he would have had no Occasion to have taken his Wife with him, to keep him in Or∣der; I wish with all my Heart his Wife could have done so the next Time of his going there; but I cannot tell whether it was, that this Gentleman grew so unruly, that his Wife chose to keep out of his Way (it would have been well for the rest of these Defendants, if they had done so too) or whether it was for other Pur∣poses:
<PB N="39" REF="47"/>
It seems he returned to the Play∣house; but with what View? Not out of Curiosity, that being fully satisfied the first Night; for then Mr. <HI>James</HI> was clearly of Opinion, that <HI>Macklin</HI> was incompetent for performing the Character of <HI>Macbeth;</HI> the Gentleman might have supposed him∣self invested with Authority, to form a Judgment upon the Merits of Mr. <HI>Mack∣lin,</HI> as a Performer, and, in Company with his Wife, whose Criticisms concur∣ring with his, <HI>Macklin</HI>'s Performance of the Character was considered, by them, as worth Nobody's while to go and see, It was odd, after he had passed this Judg∣ment, that he should chuse, whenever Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> came on again, in that Cha∣racter, to go and see him. This Case is too strong, and no Person can give this Gentleman Credit for saying, he came on Purpose afterwards to see the Play; and when Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> came upon the Stage, in different Characters, in the Play in <HI>Shylock,</HI> and in the Entertain∣ment, in Sir <HI>Archy Macsarcasm;</HI> I take Leave to suppose the Town agreed, that in these Characters Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> always
<PB N="40" REF="48"/>
had capital Merit; if there is any Merit in those Characters themselves, they are understood, by all the World, to have been exhibited with all their Advantages by Mr. <HI>Macklin;</HI> however, if it was Mr. <HI>James</HI>'s Purpose to share in the Pleasures, what drew him to see <HI>Macklin</HI> in the Characters of <HI>Shylock</HI> and Sir <HI>Archy Macsarcasm?</HI>—He was in fear, as he thinks fit to tell us, before Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> began the Character, that they would not let him go on, be∣cause they wanted Something else; they wanted an Apology, and some Explana∣tion, and God knows what; and that which I shall presently go more minutely into the Enquiry of—that Something—therefore it was, and not seeing him in Sir <HI>Archy</HI> and <HI>Shylock,</HI> clearly which drew Mr. <HI>James</HI> to see him, in those Charac∣ters, any more than when he went to see him in <HI>Macbeth.</HI> Nobody can suppose nor will Mr. <HI>James</HI> wish to be understood that seeing, applauding, or condemning the Character, were among the Object that drew Mr. <HI>James</HI>'s Attention to the Play-house. It seems, however, Mr. <HI>Jame</HI> having satisfied your Lordships these were
<PB N="41" REF="49"/>
not his Purposes, has left us no Doubt what they were; for he has had the Good∣ness to explain them. He says, the first Time, viz. the Sixth of <HI>November,</HI> there was a Talk about <HI>Reddish.</HI> His Affidavit states, that, <HI>"it appeared to this Depo∣tent, that there was no sufficient Proof, of ei∣ther the said</HI> Samuel Reddish <HI>or</HI> James Sparks <HI>hissing; neither did this Deponent think a mere Relation sufficient to contradict the Oaths of them, the said</HI> Samuel Reddish <HI>and</HI> James Sparks; <HI>and this Deponent did therefore disapprove of</HI> Macklin's <HI>Behaviour, by the common Mode of Hissing."</HI>—What other Purpose, if any, brought him there that Night? Your Lordship sees how soon he forgot—for it seems he hisses the Actor to prevent his going on; and why? Be∣cause there was not sufficient Proof to sa∣tisfy this self-created, self-erected Judge. He takes upon himself to act upon a Charge he had nothing to do with; he had no Connection with either of the Parties; but he, in pure Generosity, as Mr. <HI>Buller</HI> tells us, was inclined to take upon him to judge of those Merits, he supposed himself called upon to try, though his Proceedings,
<PB N="42" REF="50"/>
in Fact, had no Relation at all to the Me∣rits of the Performance—But Mr. <HI>James</HI> was so inattentive to the Pleasure of the Company there, as to think himself au∣thorized to disturb what they might like.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Mansfield.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I am very well satisfied, as to Mr. <HI>James</HI>—You need not go any further—I think what Mr. <HI>Buller</HI> al∣luded to, was right; if the Applica∣tion went therefore in the Way he meant it, to be sure, this Court would not encourage Complaints of the Disap∣probation or Approbation of acting upon a public Theatre; being shewn in a man∣ner in which every Part of the Auditory has a Right to shew it—But if from Ma∣lice, Ill-will, or Resentment, a Number of People are ungenerous enough to take Advantage of the Situation a poor Actor is in, being at their Mercy upon the Stage, to deprive him of his Bread, and insult him, not upon any Offence arising out of the Play, but from Malice and Conspiracy against the Person who is the Actor, to strip him of the Means of Living, that is a strong Ground of Action, which may be brought by him—I rather wished he had—
<PB N="43" REF="51"/>
I hinted and recommended to him to have brought an Action—Besides the Injury done to him, it is most indecent to the Public, and a Shame to the Police of the Kingdom—With Regard to Mr. <HI>James,</HI> he don't deny some of the principal Parts of the Charge, and upon his own Affida∣vit, he gives sufficient Ground to shew with what View, after the Sixth of <HI>No∣vember,</HI> he went there, and with what Principle, and for what Purposes—As to the Affidavit of <HI>Macdonnel</HI> and his Wife, he hardly gives an Answer to any Part of it—It is the clearest, fullest, and most ex∣press Charge, and he hardly gives an An∣swer to any Part of that Affidavit—It is very remarkable in that Affidavit, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e don't deny, Mrs. <HI>Macdonnel</HI> swears throughout, he took her for Mrs. <HI>Macklin,</HI> and challenged her with being Mrs. <HI>Mack∣lin,</HI> and all along considered her as Mrs. <HI>Macklin</HI>—He was so outrageous, so vio∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent and so mad, that he challenged Men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd Women—These are strong Words of his Affidavit, which are not answered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y him.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="52"/>
But taking it upon his own Affidavit, which is the fairest Way—He goes there upon the Sixth of <HI>November;</HI> whether he went for Amusement, or other Pur∣poses, he don't say; but he goes on the Sixth of <HI>November;</HI> he says, before the Beginning of the Play, Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> came upon the Stage, with a Parcel of Papers in his Hands, which he began to read, the Purport of which was, to prove Mr. <HI>Reddish,</HI> a Performer of <HI>Drury Lane,</HI> the first Night of his performing the Part of <HI>Macbeth,</HI> had hissed; and upon hearing the same read, it appeared to him, there was no sufficient Proof of either said <HI>Red∣dish</HI> or <HI>Sparks</HI> hissing; neither did he this Deponent think a mere Relation sufficient to contradict the Oaths of them, the said <HI>Reddish</HI> and <HI>Sparks,</HI> which they had res∣pectively made, whereby they denied it and he says, he therefore shewed his Dis∣approbation of <HI>Macklin</HI>'s Behaviour, by the common Method of Hissing, and he says he hissed that Evening—There it rests for that Night—But how comes it upon the Thirteenth of <HI>November,</HI> that he came there? With what View, and in what
<PB N="45" REF="53"/>
Company does he come there? Manifestly for Vengeance, not to see the Play—He says he went, it being the fourth Time of Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI>'s performing the Character—He says, that as <HI>Macklin</HI> had not produ∣ced any positive Proof of <HI>Reddish</HI> and <HI>Sparks</HI> Hissing, as he had pledged himself to the Public to do, he this Deponent, as well as others, called for such Proof or Concesson; and upon that, a Squabble happened with a Woman (<HI>Macdonnel</HI>'s Wife) whom he swore to be most out∣rageous—As to Proofs and Concessions, <HI>Macklin</HI> had nothing to do with it, <HI>Macklin</HI> was wrong in saying any Thing about it; and much more so, after they had made their Affidavits, to take Notice of it.</P>
<P>But he goes on Purpose, not to see the Play, but to call for Proofs and Conces∣sions—Who was to take them? Was the Court? Or the Pit? Or the Upper Gal∣lery? They had not defined what the Con∣cessions were to be, or to whom to be made—Then <HI>James</HI> is outrageous, and makes all this Work for want of Proofs end Concessions, that he had no Business to
<PB N="46" REF="54"/>
go to the Play-house to ask for—Then he has made a Slip in one Thing, which I am sure he was not aware of—It is insisted, there was no Conspiracy—To be sure no Conspiracy—The other Persons joined in the Rule, have no Acquaintance with him—But when he comes to give an Ac∣count, he says, if his <HI>Friends</HI> that went with him had not done so and so, they should not have been able to have got the better; therefore it appears he went with a Body of his Friends, to demand Proofs and Concessions, by Vociferations and Noise in the House—After this he wants to speak with <HI>Macklin</HI>—I suppose <HI>Macklin</HI> took Care not to meet him—He was afraid to speak to him, as he was so boisterous, but to Mr. <HI>Coleman</HI> he desires to be excused giving him any Satisfaction about this Wo∣man at all—In Consequence of this Mr. <HI>James</HI> sends a Challenge, and publishes it in the News-papers—He writes to him in this Manner.</P>
<Q>Sir, I call upon you thus publicly, to declare your Reasons for refusing to meet me at Mr. <HI>Coleman</HI>'s, or elsewhere, as likewise who the Gentlewoman is,
<PB N="47" REF="55"/>
who first struck, and <HI>then</HI> set a Russian to assault me, on <HI>Saturday</HI> Evening last, in the Gallery of <HI>Covent Garden</HI> The∣atre, she being afterwards watched in∣to your House, in <HI>James Street, Covent Garden.</HI> This I must insist upon, as I intend then to leave you to the Stings of your own malevolent Heart, and the Resentment of the much injured Public.</Q>
<P>Then for fear the Court should not be able to perceive it was a Challenge, <HI>James</HI> takes Care of this, for he declares in his Affidavit, that Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> did not dare to answer him, <HI>either in a public or private Manner.</HI></P>
<P>However, this is not a Conspiracy. He says he is not acquainted with the par∣ticular Persons that might be there—There might be Scores or Hundreds concerned in it—Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> singled out, as well as he could, those he was able to give Evi∣dence of—<HI>James</HI> says he did not enter into a Conspiracy to drive <HI>Macklin</HI> for ever from the Stage—But still he should give Proofs or Concessions before he acted again.</P>
<P>Now as to a Conspiracy, it is not ne∣cessary to prove a parole or written Agree∣ment,
<PB N="48" REF="56"/>
in order to make a Conspiracy; if persons concur in Acts to do the same Thing, that is Evidence to be left to a Jury, whether it is or is not a Conspiracy? You all remember the Case of the Ghost-Several Persons were there convicted of a Conspiracy. I believed what they them∣selves said, when they moved the Court for a new Trial, that they had not a pa∣role Communication, much less a written Agreement; but they all concurred in the same Imposition upon the Public, by setting up this Ghost. I said upon the Trial, if the Jury thought they all con∣curred towards the same End, and upon any bad or improper Principles, took Par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in setting up that Ghost, that it was no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> necessary to prove either a parole or writ∣ten Agreement to do it; and upon th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Motion for a new Trial, the Court was o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that Opinion.—But what is this Case <HI>James</HI> denies he entered into a Conspirac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to drive <HI>Macklin</HI> from the Stage—But wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> did he want? All he wanted was a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Answer to his Question, and an Apolog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for <HI>Macklin</HI>'s Conduct towards <HI>Samu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Reddish</HI> and <HI>James Sparks</HI>—What had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

Acting in this manner was very malevolent to Mr. <HI>Macklin.</HI> With respect to <HI>James</HI> therefore, let the Rule be made absolute. Go on with the next.</P>

<P>I am for Mr. <HI>Miles,</HI> and shall trouble your Lordship with such An∣swers to the Charge against him, as occur to me.</P>
<P>I apprehend there is very little Proof against Mr. <HI>Miles</HI>—He is charged with being present in <HI>Covent Garden</HI> House up∣on the Eighteenth of <HI>November;</HI> that he hissed, was noisy, and outrageous, with a great Number of other Persons in the Pit—He is likewise charged with having wrote something upon Paper, and throw∣ing it out of the Pit upon the Stage—What the Contents of the Paper were, is not stated; so I presume your Lordships will not consider it to be so stated—Then
<PB N="50" REF="58"/>
that he had a Conference with Mr. <HI>Woodward,</HI> and after that <HI>Woodward</HI> re∣tired. I think that is the whole of the Charge made upon Mr. <HI>Miles.</HI> He is not charged with being present in the Even∣ing Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> acted <HI>Macbeth</HI>—I under∣stand there was a strange Disturbance upon the Eighteenth of <HI>November;</HI> but he is not charged with any Conspiracy, except what could be inferred from expressing his Disapprobation at the Time of Acting, by Hissing—No Suspicion can properly fall upon <HI>Miles</HI>—On his Part I have an Affidavit, by which he declares he went to the House upon the Eighteenth of <HI>No∣vember,</HI> for the Purpose of seeing Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> act the Part of <HI>Shylock,</HI> and the Part of Sir <HI>Archy Macsarcasm,</HI> in an En∣tertainment; in which Parts I understand he has always acquitted himself with great Applause—He says the Audience was very noisy, at the Time of drawing up the Curtain, and he, not approving altogether of Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI>'s Conduct, joined in some Degree with the Noise of the House; so far he admits, but says he did it merely because he thought Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> ought,
<PB N="51" REF="59"/>
after what he said, to make some little Concession to the Public—That he did not do it with any View or Intention of driv∣ing him from his Profession—In short, that he was in no Combination, and had no Malice against <HI>Macklin.</HI> Thus it stands upon Mr. <HI>Miles</HI>'s Affidavit. I apprehend therefore, with Deference to your Lord∣ships, from the whole of the Case, it ap∣pears there was no Malice, or Intention of Malice—That <HI>Miles</HI> went there as a Spec∣tator—That what be did was no more than expressing his Disapprobation of <HI>Macklin,</HI> as every Person in a Play-house generally does, if they dislike a Performance—That he considered himself as having a Right to do it, and if any Consequence arose from it, by that Behaviour, Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> may have his Remedy by Action—But I trust, in such a Case as this, your Lordships will never let an Information go against him.</P>

<P>SAITH, That he want into the pit of the Theatre Royal <HI>Covent Gar∣den,</HI> on the Eighteenth of <HI>November</HI> last, to see the Play of the <HI>Merchant</HI> of <HI>Venice,</HI> and the Farce of <HI>Love a la Mode,</HI> advertised for that Night; and that on drawing up the Curtain, the Audience became very clamorous for the Appear∣ance of the acting Manager, and in∣cessantly called out for Mr. <HI>Coleman</HI> to come on the Stage; saith, that <HI>Mack∣lin,</HI> habited in the Character of <HI>Shylock,</HI> came on the Stage, in Opposition to the general Sense of the Audience, and on being desired to go off, he peremptorily refused, and, in the most insolent Man∣ner, advanced to the Orchestra, and stampt with his Feet, and continued on the Stage.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Mansfield.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I am for Mr. <HI>Clarke;</HI> so far as respects him, from the State of <HI>Macklin</HI>'s Affidavit, the Charge is, that upon the Eighteenth of <HI>November</HI> (the Affidavit not pretending <HI>Clarke</HI> to be at <HI>Covent Garden</HI> Theatre upon any former Occasions) that he sat in a Box one Story high, over the Stage; that when he made his Appearance, he was saluted with the waving of Sticks, and a Noise—Then it is charged, that <HI>Clarke</HI> made a Signal to the Audience; next, that there was a His∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing, and crying off, off—That he gave several Signals, which, from their con∣stantly producing the same Effect, Depo∣nent <HI>Macklin</HI> apprehends were pre-con∣certed Signals, which <HI>Clarke</HI> sometimes made with his Hat, and sometimes with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Piece of Wood he had in his Hand, co∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ered with red Cloth; with which he me∣naced
<PB N="56" REF="64"/>
<HI>Macklin,</HI> and called upon him to kneel down and ask Pardon. Now in that Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> is unconfirmed, and it is de∣nied by <HI>Clarke.</HI> Next it is charged, that he cried off, off, and that he beat the Scenes most furiously with the Board that he threw a Note upon the Stage, and ordered the Actors to go off; that he roar∣ed out <HI>Coleman, Coleman,</HI> and desired him to come upon the Stage; that <HI>Clarke</HI> ap∣peared to be one of those Persons to whom this Riot and Behaviour was imputable. This is the whole of the Charge against <HI>Clarke. Macklin</HI> lumps him with the se∣veral other Persons, <HI>Leigh, Miles,</HI> and the others; and says, he understands it was a Combination by all these Persons, for dis∣charging him from the Stage, whence he was afterwards discharged: Mr. <HI>Clarke</HI> is a Gentleman of <HI>Surry,</HI> lives at <HI>Moulsey,</HI> and is a Man of Fortune: He gives this An∣swer; that he never was at the Theatre, either of the four Times, when <HI>Macklin</HI> acted <HI>Macbeth.</HI> It might be owing to his Misfortune, his not seeing the Cha∣racter of <HI>Macbeth</HI> shine in Mr. <HI>Macklin,</HI> an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no doubt it did, if he had had the Pleasure
<PB N="57" REF="65"/>
of seeing him act in that Character, I dare say it would have so recommended Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> to him, that he would not have been induced to do as he did. He went to see Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> in the two Characters of <HI>Shy∣lock</HI> and Sir <HI>Archy Macsarcasm;</HI> he denies he is at all conscious of making any Sa∣lutations to the Audience, or that the Au∣dience made any Return to them; he tells your Lordships, It is true, that he took up a Piece of Board with a red Cloth, which was in the Box, and that he made as much Noise as any Body in the House; that he struck it against the Scenes, and against the Side of the Wainscot of the Box; that soon after the Curtain was drawn up, there was a prodigious Cry of off, off; that soon after Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> came upon the Stage in the Dress of <HI>Shylock;</HI> that there was then some Talk or Dispute be∣tween <HI>Macklin</HI> and some Gentlemen in the Pit; that <HI>Macklin</HI> retired, and came in his own proper Dress; that there was then a great Cry of off, off; that <HI>Macklin</HI> was called out to, by a great Number of the Audience, to make good the Charge against <HI>Reddish</HI> and <HI>Sparks,</HI> for some
<PB N="58" REF="66"/>
Offence against the People; and <HI>Clarke</HI> tells your Lordship, that finding a Majo∣rity of the Audience in this, he did con∣cur in saying, off, off, and hissing, and striking the Board against the Scenes and Box, finding a Majority of the Audience calling to <HI>Macklin</HI> to submit and beg Par∣don, he joined with the rest. That he then sent a Note to Mr. <HI>Coleman,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> states; he threw the Note upon the Stage, which was a Note to <HI>Coleman,</HI> to beg he would come upon the Stage to make Peace; to desire <HI>Macklin</HI> to quiet the Audience, which he was told he might, if he would beg their Pardon; he says, Mr. <HI>Coleman</HI> did not come upon the Stage; and then Mr. <HI>Clarke</HI> tells your Lordships, he went away and left the House. One of the Affidavits states, that he was upon the Stage afterwards, and Mr. <HI>Coleman</HI> came there; but he denies that, and says he went to <HI>Drury Lane</HI> directly.</P>
<P>As to preconcerting of Signals, he does, in express Terms, swear, he never precon∣certed Signals with any Person whomever—That those Gentlemen, who were taking an active Part and Lead in the Business,
<PB N="59" REF="67"/>
stood in the Pit—one was represented as holding up a Paper, Mr. <HI>Sparks,</HI> I believe, and one was threatening with a Stick, they were taking different Parts—he says, that he had no more to do with it, than there being a Noise of crying off, he did the same, and struck the Place with the Board—that he not only had no kind of Preconcert with them at all, but was a total Stranger to them, and never spoke to any one of them in his Life, nor to Mr. <HI>Macklin,</HI> upon any other Subject; the last Thing he did, before his going to <HI>Drury Lane</HI> Theatre was, he met <HI>Miles</HI> as he was going out, who said something to him, but he does not know what he said—he denies having had any Connection with any Person whomsoever—he admits he certainly bore a Part, he hissed, and knock∣ed the Board he had in his Hand, which he had taken out of the Balcony, against the Box, in which he was—he says, that he had no malevolent Design against <HI>Mack∣lin,</HI> that he wished <HI>Macklin</HI> would come and beg Pardon; with which the People would be perfectly satisfied—If the Busi∣ness of this Court is to consider, whether
<PB N="60" REF="68"/>
a Man hath acted with perfect Decency upon these Occasions, I could not acquit Mr. <HI>Clarke</HI> most certainly; but Mr. <HI>Calrke</HI> never conceived any Degree of Malice against Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> at any Time; he had no Altercation with <HI>Macklin,</HI> he had no other Connection or Concern in the Af∣frays, than what he has submitted in his Affidavit, which, when your Lordships have heard read, you will find no Ground to involve Mr. <HI>Clarke</HI> in this Information if there is any, it must be upon the Ground of Conspiracy, on the Part of Mr. <HI>Clarke</HI> to do <HI>Macklin</HI> an Injury.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. CLARKE's Affidavit read.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Affidavit of JOSEPH CLARKE, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> sworn the 20th of <HI>May,</HI> 1774.</HEAD>
<P>SAITH on <HI>November</HI> 18, 1773, he went to the Theatre Royal, <HI>Covent Garden,</HI> to see the Play of the Mer∣chant of <HI>Venice,</HI> and the Entertainment of <HI>Love a la Mode,</HI> and got to said The∣atre before the Curtain was drawn up and sat in the Box, one Story high, over the Stage.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="69"/>
Denies, that to his Knowledge or Be∣half that, on making his Appearance in said Box, he was saluted with three Chears, with waving of Hats, bran∣dishing of Sticks, or that he received any Salutation whatsoever, with Ac∣knowledgment and Satisfaction, or re∣turned any Salutation made to him.</P>
<P>Denies, that as the Curtain was drawing up, he made any Signal, with his Hat, to the Audience, or any Thing else to make an Outrage of Hissing or Hooting, or to cry off, off, off.</P>
<P>Saith, that as soon as the Curtain drew up, and two of the Performers of the Play came on the Stage, a great many of the Audience in the Pit cried off, off, off, and the Players with∣drew from off the Stage, and there∣upon Mr. <HI>Charles Macklin,</HI> in the Dress of <HI>Shylock,</HI> came on the Stage, when some Altercation or Dispute arose be∣tween the said <HI>Macklin</HI> and some Persons in the Pit, when said <HI>Macklin</HI> went off the Stage, and took off the Dress of <HI>Shylock,</HI> and came on the Stage again, in his common Dress, when he was cal∣led
<PB N="62" REF="70"/>
upon by the Majority of the Au∣dience, as Deponent believes, to make good his Charge against <HI>Reddish</HI> and <HI>Sparks,</HI> and to clear up some other Mat∣ters which he was accused with; but <HI>Macklin,</HI> as Deponent verily believes, desired further Time to make good his Charge against <HI>Reddish</HI> and <HI>Sparks,</HI> and to clear up such other Matters, with which he was accused; that thereupon <HI>Macklin</HI> was called upon, by the Ma∣jority of the Audience, as Deponent be∣lieves, to make his Submission to the whole Audience, by asking Pardon; which said <HI>Macklin</HI> refused to do, and said <HI>Macklin</HI> not making good his Charge against <HI>Reddish</HI> and <HI>Sparks,</HI> and not clearing up the Matters with which he was accused, and not making a Submis∣sion to the Audience, as was required, Deponent did, as did the Majority of the Audience, as Deponent believes, Hiss, and cry Off, off, off.</P>
<P>Admits he had a Board, or false Rail in his Hand, covered with red, which was loose on the Top of the Box, where he leant over, which Deponent
<PB N="63" REF="71"/>
believes takes off, and puts on, occa∣sionally; and admits he made a Noise with said Board, by striking it against the Box and Scenes; but denies, to his Knowledge or Belief, he menaced or threatened said <HI>Macklin</HI> with the same.</P>
<P>Saith, that said <HI>Macklin</HI> continued obstinate in not making a Submission, and the Audience beginning to be more violent than ever, Deponent wrote a Note to Mr. <HI>Coleman,</HI> the Manager of said House, to desire he would come on the Stage, which Deponent thought would be the only Way to put an End to the Disturbance; but said <HI>Macklin</HI> refused to come, and Deponent there∣upon went to said <HI>Coleman</HI> in the Green Room, and desired he would appear on the Stage, and inform the Audience, that whilst said <HI>Macklin</HI> lay under their Displeasure, that he should not appear again on the Stage, until he had made a proper Submission to the Public, or used Words to that Effect, and the reason of Deponent's so doing was, be∣cause he apprehended it was most likely to put an End to the Disturbance.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="72"/>
Saith, said <HI>Coleman</HI> still refusing to come on the Stage, Deponent imme∣diately left said Theatre, and went to the Theatre Royal in <HI>Drury Lane.</HI></P>
<P>Saith, he hath been informed and believes, that said <HI>Coleman</HI> did after∣wards that Evening come on said Stage, and address himself to the Audience; and saith, he never preconcerted any Signals with <HI>William Augustus Miles, John Stephen James, Ralph Aldus, Thomas Leigh</HI> and <HI>James Sparks,</HI> or any of them, to be given by him, said <HI>Jo∣seph Clarke,</HI> on said 18th of <HI>November,</HI> at Theatre Royal, <HI>Covent Garden.</HI> But, on the contrary, Deponent saith he was, before 18th of said <HI>November,</HI> and whilst the Disturbance was making in said House that Evening, a total Stranger to said <HI>Miles, James, Aldus Leigh</HI> and <HI>Sparks,</HI> and never had any Conversation with them, or any or either of them, touching said <HI>Macklin,</HI> or any Thing else, except that Deponent met said <HI>Miles</HI> by Accident that Night, as he was going behind the Scenes to the Green Room, to Mr. <HI>Coleman</HI> as
<PB N="65" REF="73"/>
aforesaid, who spoke to Deponent; but what he said Deponent can't recol∣lect.</P>
<P>Saith, he never preconcerted any Sig∣nals, to be given by him, said 18th of <HI>November,</HI> at the Theatre Royal <HI>Covent Garden,</HI> with any Person or Persons whatsoever; and denies, to his Know∣ledge or Belief, he menaced said <HI>Mack∣lin,</HI> with said Board covered with red as aforesaid, and denies he made any Sig∣nals with it to make a Disturbance, in said Theatre, said 18th of <HI>November;</HI> but admits he had said Board in his Hand, and struck it against the Box and Scenes, and made a Noise with it.</P>
<P>Denies, he called upon said <HI>Macklin,</HI> to kneel down and ask Pardon, but admits he cried off, off, off, which seemed to Deponent to be the general Sense of the Audience then present; and denies he did in Conjunction with <HI>Miles, James, Aldus, Leigh</HI> and <HI>Sparks,</HI> or any of them, or with any other Person, compel the Managers of said Theatre to discharge said <HI>Macklin</HI> from his Em∣ploy, Deponent having no such Wish,
<PB N="66" REF="74"/>
Desire or Intention; but verily believes, that if said <HI>Macklin</HI> had made a proper Submission to the Audience, the same would have been accepted, by the Ma∣jority thereof, which would have put an End to the Disturbance.</P>
<P>Denies, that he ever entered into any Combination, Conspiracy, or Agree∣ment with said <HI>Miles, James, Aldus Leigh</HI> and <HI>Sparks,</HI> or any of them, or any other Person against said <HI>Macklin</HI> in order to discharge him from the The∣atre, on said 18th of <HI>November,</HI> or any other Time.</P>
<P>Saith, he had not any ill Will against said <HI>Macklin,</HI> but was desirous, as he believes was the Majority of the Au∣dience then present, that said <HI>Macklin</HI> should have made a proper Submission to the Public, as well on Account o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> said <HI>Samuel Reddish</HI> and <HI>James Sparks</HI> as on Account of other Matters, which he was accused with.</P>
<P>Saith, he was not at the said Thea∣tre the 23d or 30th of <HI>October</HI> last nor the 6th or 13th of said <HI>November</HI> when said <HI>Macklin</HI> appeared in the Cha∣racter
<PB N="67" REF="75"/>
of <HI>Macbeth;</HI> and denies he was in said Play-House on the 18th of said <HI>November,</HI> when Mr. <HI>Coleman</HI> came on the Stage, Deponent having before that Time left the said House.</P>

<P>There is enough in <HI>Clarke</HI>'s Admission to be sure; he joins with them most outrageously, because <HI>Macklin</HI> did not make out the Charge against <HI>Reddish</HI> and <HI>Sparks,</HI> therefore the Rule must be absolute, as to him.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Dunning.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It would be a Pity if the Standard Bearer did not make one with the Troop, when he held the Trophy; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> lifted up the Flag, which was the Flag of Death.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Wallace.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>After hearing the Rules <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our Lordship hath laid down (tho' I con∣ceive upon Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI>'s appealing to the Public, he had submitted to their Sen∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence) I shall not trouble the Court, on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Part of Mr. <HI>Aldus;</HI> he went there up∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n this Dispute about <HI>Reddish</HI> and <HI>Sparks,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> doubt, as well as many more; and af∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <HI>Macklin</HI>'s Appeal to the Public, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ought to make him appear in that, more

ridiculous, than in any Character he at∣tempted to play.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Mansfield.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>They certainly did so. If they had only whipt him a little, and mortified him, it would not have been so much; but when it is carried so far, as to advise the Managers to discharge him, and take his Bread from him, it is then carried too far; and I would advise them, now the Rules are gone, instead of the vast Expence it will be in going on, to make a reasonable Satisfaction and Com∣position, and to let Part of the Money that would go amongst you, Gentlemen, be applied towards that Satisfaction.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Davenport.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Sparks</HI> is the Man that went to the Antelope Alehouse with <HI>Leigh</HI> to get a Party together.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Mansfield</HI> to Mr. Serjeant <HI>Davy</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Are you for <HI>Sparks</HI> and <HI>Leigh?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Serjeant <HI>Davy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I am for <HI>Sparks.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Mansfield.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>With regard to <HI>Sparks,</HI> supposing him (I have not the Particulars in my Mind, but supposing him) to be charged as the greatest Aggressor, I think there should be no Rule against him
<PB N="69" REF="77"/>
<HI>Macklin</HI> was extremely wrong to call in Question, in that public Way, the Vera∣city of <HI>Sparks;</HI> therefore I think the Rule should not go, as to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Dunning.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Your Lordship will give me Leave to mention what the Charge is. It goes precisely to this Point; <HI>Sparks,</HI> in Concurrence with <HI>Leigh,</HI> hires People to drive <HI>Macklin</HI> away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Mansfield.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Supposing it ever so strong, Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> was in the wrong, with regard to <HI>Reddish</HI> and <HI>Sparks,</HI> in ap∣pealing to the Public; and a Man who is in the wrong, should not come for the In∣terposition of this Court, against another Person, who is in the wrong.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Murphy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I will tell your Lordship how that Matter stands, and then your Lordship will judge how far Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> was wrong, in regard to <HI>Sparks.</HI> The Fact is, that Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> was attacked the first Night, and upon his first Appearance in <HI>Macbeth.</HI> He had not been used to that Sort of Behaviour during forty Years, and was very much astonished what could oc∣casion it—Three Persons informed him (one of whom hath now made an Affida∣vit)
<PB N="70" REF="78"/>
that <HI>Sparks</HI> and <HI>Reddish</HI> were the Peo∣ple who occasioned the Tumult in the Gal∣lery the first Night—Then upon the sub∣sequent <HI>Saturday</HI> (it was Upon a <HI>Saturday</HI> he first applied) Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> finding all the News-papers, Day after Day, Morn∣ing and Evening, pouring out the most virulent Abuse upon him, calling him Murderer, Villain, and the most oppro∣brious Names of every sort, and Para∣graphs desiring the Public to drive him from the Stage, if he ever appeared again; he went upon the Stage with a large Bun∣dle of Papers, the Papers of a Week, (as I am informed, I was not there—but I think it is so upon the Affidavits) he said he had been long in their Service, and there was his Reward, pointing to the Bundle of Papers of the whole Week, which he held in his Hands, full of every Scurrility that could be inserted in News Papers, poured out upon him, and Para∣graph's, desiring the Public to drive him from the Stage, and submitted to their Judgment, whether they would permit him to play the Characters that Night—that he had been informed <HI>Sparks</HI> and
<PB N="71" REF="79"/>
<HI>Reddish</HI> were the Persons who begun the Riot. Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> agreed with me, that News Paper Paragraphs were odious, and it appeared to me not to be a desirable Way for Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> to refute, even <HI>Red∣dish</HI> upon his Oath—he readily concurred with me; and as he could not get People to prove it upon Oath, he was to procure the Papers, and read the Proof on <HI>Sa∣turday.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Mansfield.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How dared Mr. <HI>Mack∣lin</HI> attempt to prove a Perjury upon <HI>Reddish;</HI> he charged <HI>Sparks</HI> and <HI>Reddish</HI> in the News Papers with having hissed him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Dunning.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I fancy your Lordship mistakes the Fact at present in Favour of Mr. <HI>Sparks;</HI> for the Point about which, these Parties disputed, was the Unsatis∣factoriness of the Proof insisted upon; and the Fact to be decided by this singular Tribunal was, whether Mr. <HI>Reddish</HI> had hissed? <HI>Sparks</HI> adopts the Charge as far as respected him; but, says he, though I did hiss, which I have a right to do, yet, <HI>Reddish</HI> being an Actor, it is Matter of Imputation upon him; and I, as his Cham∣pion, will make good the Charge; the
<PB N="72" REF="80"/>
Point to be tried was, whether they were truly or falsely charged?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Mansfield.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That don't vary it; he charges <HI>Sparks</HI> with hissing, and brings the Proof upon the Stage—charging both him and <HI>Reddish,</HI> and appeals in that way; that was wrong, he should have applied to the Laws of the Country; and if he would not, he shall not come here for an extraordinary Interposition—I go upon the Ground of <HI>Sparks</HI>'s being more guilty than any, against whom the Rules are gone—that may be taken to the Grand Jury—but with regard to <HI>Leigh,</HI> the Rule must be made absolute, as it was enlarged for him; and the Rule must be discharged as to <HI>Sparks.</HI></P>
