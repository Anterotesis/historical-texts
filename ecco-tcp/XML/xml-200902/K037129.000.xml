<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HON. LORD CAMDEN, LORD PRESIDENT OF HIS MAJESTY'S MOST HONORABLE PRIVY-COUNCIL.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I consider the high rank you have long held as an enlightened Statesman, an accom∣plished Orator, and a wise Legislator, I fear I shall incur the censure of presumption, for daring to trespass upon that attention, so much more nobly employed in meditating your country's good. But great minds can descend with ease, from the dignity of their spheres, to the contemplation of the most minute objects; and what would confuse, or impede, the operation of feebler faculties, acts only as a relief to superior spirits, lend∣ing them additional vigour in pursuits, which call forth all their energies. Your Lordship's partiality to the Dramatic Muse is well known; and the ME∣CAENAS of a GARRICK may naturally expect, that Writers for the Stage will lay their offerings at the feet of a Nobleman, universally allowed the most ex∣quisite Judge in their own art.—Not content with the private satisfaction I enjoy from my veneration for splendid abilities, and distinguished virtue, I am am∣bitious the world should know I am capable of ad∣miring them.—There is a protecting influence in the name of CAMDEN, that recommends to the wife, and to the good; it is auspicious to every Muse, and every honorable undertaking—and as such, I have prefixed it to my work; in imitation of the first CAESAR, who concealed his baldness under a laurel.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I have the honor to remain, with the most profound respect, MY LORD, Your most devoted and obedient Servant, FREDERICK PILON.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<P>I don't know how other people may find themselves, but the coming on of winter always makes a vast change in my spirits; I have often wished that I had wings, that I might fly round the world after the summer.</P>

<SPEAKER>Rach.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, Ma'am! one has so much plea∣sure in London, it is impossible to know the difference betwixt summer and winter. But how mortifying it is to live so trifling a distance from Bath, and to be so seldom indulged with the pleasures of it!—I long to see my old master laid up with a fit of the gout, as much as he does to get ease from it; for then you know, Ma'am, the family would remove to lodgings on the South Parade: with what pleasure I put on his flannels, and see him pump'd of a morning!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charl.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I thought your regard for me had re∣conciled you to your present situation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rach.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so it has, Ma'am; if my regard for you was not very great indeed, do you think I'd consent to be buried alive in this old crazy mansion-house, that looks as if it were left standing only for the rooks to build their nests in? Ah, Ma'am! if I had your beauty, and your fortune, I'd see the world, and the world should see me too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charl.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what could you do with a man of my father's temper?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rach.</SPEAKER>
<P>More than he could do with a girl of my spirit.—Whenever our sex is used ill by a cross-grain'd old father, or a surly husband, especially, Ma'am, when we are a little <HI>handsomish,</HI> it is either because we don't know our own power, or are afraid to use it.— Why, there's Mr. Summers now, who has been so long courting you; what is the reason Mr. Bale won't con∣sent to your marriage? Isn't he a gentleman of as good family, and as good fortune, as any in the country? —Od's my life, Ma'am! pluck up a spirit; and, since he is determined to shut us up, like two star∣lings in a dark cage, I think it is fit he should know we have learned to talk in our confinement.</P>

</SP>

<P>Her father has a fine fortune in that coun∣try, and is too fond of his amiable daughter to let her continue much longer in Europe.

<P>My dear Angelica, how happy have you made me by this visit!</P>
</SP>

<P>And to enhance the value of it, I am come down to you when every body else begins to think of quitting the country—in the month of September;
<PB N="12" REF="8"/>when the groves have ceased to be tuneful, and old Autumn is shaking hands with Winter; as if I came on the opening of the season to enjoy the pleasures of partridge-shooting.</P>

<P>There is a cloud hangs upon your brow, Charlotte; come, open your heart, and let friendship disperse it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charl.</SPEAKER>
<P>You remember Mr. Summers?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; and from the grave tone in which you pronounce his name, I conclude you two have quar∣relled.—Pho, pho! if that's all, I'll make up the breach; when lovers fall out, the high-priest of Cupid is piling up the blind God's altars with a little fresh fuel, which of course gives a temporary damp to the blaze; but a few sighs breathed from the bottom of two repenting hearts, and their flames burn brighter than before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would I had nothing more serious to make me unhappy! but every tender hope and fonder vi∣sion which rose in flattering prospect, are no more.— Summers's visits have been long forbidden; my in∣human father insists upon my banishing every thought of him, as he had himself fixed upon another match for me; I have never seen the husband of his choice, nor did I know his name till this morning; but I understand that he is next heir to a title, and is ex∣pected here every hour to fulfil the ambitious views
<PB N="13" REF="9"/>of my father, and give my fate for life the seal of wretchedness.</P>

<P>Poor Charlotte!—Fortune is determined to persecute us both; for know, my friend, I am not what I seem—the gaiety of my words and looks are all a counterfeit: my heart is, like yours, the martyr of a fatal passion—a passion so hopeless, that every smile which peers upon my brow, shews like a garland some poor victim wears that's doom'd to bleed in sacrifice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can that be possible?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>You say that you are debarred all intercourse with the man of your heart; he neither hears your sighs, nor is witness to the tears you shed for him.— My destiny is to the full as forlorn, with this differ∣ence, that I have not the faintest hope of my passion ever meeting a return, and that I am divided from the object of it as far as seas, and the western world can part us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is there a heart so insensible, that loveliness, like Angelica's, could make no impression on?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall hear.—As my father lived in the interior part of the province of South-Carolina, he sent my brother, attended by two servants, to escort me in safety to Charles Town, where I was to embark
<PB N="14" REF="10"/>for England. Through the ignorance of guides we lost our way, and fell in with a party of the French; but were scarce made prisoners, when an alarm was given of an enemy being in sight. Oh, Heavens! how my heart beat!—It was a detachment of horse from the King's troops. Motionless and dumb, I heard the shout of war—saw both battles charge— when a trance relieved me from the agony of my fears. The first object my eyes afterwards encoun∣tered was an officer in the British uniform, who looked tenderly in my face, as if he had been anxiously waiting my recovery. Oh, Charlotte! how shall I describe him to you?—Imagine a person, the most captivating, manners the most winningly polished, and a countenance in which sweetness had so tempered the manly daring of the soldier, that, like Mars, when disarming by the Graces, he appear'd resigning the Laurel for the Myrtle of Love. I hear the music of his voice this moment.—"Madam," said he, taking me respectfully by the hand, <Q>you are no longer a prisoner.—It gives me inexpressible concern, that the nature of my orders will not allow me to see you safe to the end of your journey; but if we ever meet again!</Q>—At these sad words, the drums beat, and the trumpet blew its silver sum∣mons; —my brother in the same instant urged the dangers of delay, and pressed me to renew our jour∣ney; —with reluctance and regret I yielded to his remonstrances; when turning round to take a parting look of my gallant soldier, I found he was gone—the whole party had rode off at full speed; in a few mi∣nutes I could see nothing but a cloud of dust, and for ever lost sight of my deliverer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Had you no means or opportunity of learn∣ing his name?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; I understood from one of the wounded left behind after the action, that his name is Mount∣ford, a Colonel in the English army.</P>

<P>I am very proud, Charlotte, to find the Co∣lonel employs so much of your thoughts.—I have just received a packet from his father, Lord Mount∣ford, acquainting me that his son arrived four days since from America, and that I may expect him this afternoon at my house, in order to fulfil the articles of the bargain concluded in his absence; therefore prepare to receive the man who is to be your hus∣band.</P>

<P>I vow to George, this is very fortunate!—to come down just in the nick of time to be present at your cousin's wedding!—I certainly should have sent for you, if I thought I could depend upon your keep∣ing a secret; but it is the part of prudence to con∣ceal all plans of consequence, till they are too ripe to be frustrated by accident or stratagem. This was my method forty years ago in matters of business; a secret in my possession was treasure under-ground; no fund∣ing it out in whispers and half-hints, to set the Bulls and the Bears of curiosity at work: I was as close as an iron chest; and had a knack of holding my tongue without ever looking the wiser for it.—But this was all method; and whoever expects to thrive in the world, must consider method as the foundation-stone, upon which Trade builds the house of Wealth and Prosperity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, Sir, you are determined upon my un∣doing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bale.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Zounds! would you have me break my word with my Lord Mountford, and forego the ad∣vantages of so noble an alliance?—But say no more,
<PB N="16" REF="12"/>my plan is laid; and if I had no regard to my pro∣mise, or to my interest, I hope I have some little re∣gard to consistency and method in my proceedings.</P>

<P>I'll not hear a syllable from either party—I am fixed in my resolution, and my daughter knows it.—Do you think I have got a weather-cock upon my shoulders?

<P>Dear Ma'am! young fellows will be young fellows, and youth is a soil that yields the better crop for having a little wild oat-seed sown in it: but the Colonel, Ma'am, is a man of the strictest honor; he has resigned his former commission, and now wishes to sight under the banners of an English commander.</P>

<P>I find he has got a most strenuous advocate for his vices.</P>

<P>His vices! Lord, Ma'am, how can you call a stray thought, especially before marriage, by so hard a name? for my part, I consider these little trips of the fancy in the light of deserters; the par∣tial defection of a few from an army, is no reproach to the loyalty of the main body; oh, Ma'am, his heart lies in this house.</P>

<P>Dear Mountford, welcome to England!— I am heartily rejoiced to see you; but to meet thus

<P>In answer to your first question, I must tell you, that it is now about a twelvemonth since I have succeeded to an uncle's estate down here in Somer∣setshire, and have resided ever since at Bath, and in reply to your second, I met my old acquaintance Car∣bine, who directed me here to you.

<P>The match I am come upon, I must own is entirely prudential.—But what would you say to me, if I had been downright in love since I left Eng∣land; had doted to excess, felt all the pains of the most lively passion, and for a woman I never beheld but once?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mountf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Commanded last year on a secret expedi∣tion through the interior part of South-Carolina, I met a woman, who at first sight made an impression on me I feel to this hour. She was taken prisoner by the French, when I had the good fortune to be the in∣strument of her deliverance; but as my orders were to proceed by the most rapid marches, I was obliged to quit her nearly in the instant I had rescued her; and, what is worse, before I had an opportunity of knowing who she was.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sum.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did she refuse to tell you her name?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mountf.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, but I feared to ask it; for you must know, there was a gentleman with her, who, from his attention, I took to be her husband; then, whatever servants she had were dispersed by the engagement, or I might have learned her name, and place of abode; but Fortune was my foe, and determined we never should meet: So now, at my father's earnest request, I have quitted the army, in order to take a wife he has chosen for me, and forget this fair enchantress I have been so long dreaming of.</P>

<P>Is she then gone?</P>

<P>She is indeed, Sir, gone off in a post-chaise with a gentleman; she's now fifty miles from this at least.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bale.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am satisfied if she were a hundred, so she's bot in the fish pond; but damme you dog, why did n't you alarm the family sooner? if I had received an

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I have only just had my legs at liberty— I was tied neck and heels, and roll'd like a nine-pin under the garden wall, where I have been freezing these two hours.</P>

<SPEAKER>Bale.</SPEAKER>
<P>So then my whole plan is come to the ground; henceforward I may pay as little regard to method as my daughter has done in her proceedings—my calcu∣lations too—my cares for a rising generation are all become useless: no later than yesterday, I made a pro∣vision in the army for a youth, who, tho' he's not yet born, I sat down as a general. I had likewise married two of my grand-daughters to great advantage in the next century; but the rebellion of this undutiful girl, has clouded all my prospects, so that it's probable I shall leave the world, without having fixt in life a single branch of my posterity.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mountf.</SPEAKER>
<P>You certainly have mistaken the house, Carbine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carb.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's impossible Sir; I never forget a house when I have contracted my first acquaintance with the family, as I did with this; by being taken into pay, and regaled with a fine cold chicken, and a glass of choice old Madeira.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mountf.</SPEAKER>
<P>All appears confusion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every thing wore a different aspect when I was here: the house was all chearfulness; the doors flew open, as if the hinges had life in 'em; then, I thought the servants all so well bred—the butler in particular is the most of a gentleman, perhaps, ever presided in a pantry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mountf.</SPEAKER>
<P>And while I have been assisting my friend Summers to remove his mistress from her father's, all this change has happen'd; neither my father-in-law or my intended bride are visible: there is a strange air of mystery about this business.—Upon my word, friend Carbine, I begin to entertain some doubts both of your veracity, and of my mistress's beauty; come, own the truth, is n't she confounded ugly?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carb.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis very strange a man can get no credit for telling the truth!—I tell you, Sir—but softly, softly—
<PB N="33" REF="29"/>here comes a lovely evidence in support of my repu∣tation.</P>
<STAGE>Looking out.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mountf.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, that lady?—Is that Miss Bale?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carb.</SPEAKER>
<P>She herself, Sir; her father introduced me— I beg pardon—I meant to say, Mr. Bale pointed her out to me this morning, in company with her cousin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mountf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it possible?—Can I believe my eyes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Leave me.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mountf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good Heavens, Madam! were you not taken prisoner in America?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was, Sir; and with grateful remembrance I declare, that I owe my freedom to the gallant Mount∣ford.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mountf.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are certain moments, in which the mind doubts whether it actually wakes, or is only de∣luded by the phantoms of a vision; I am now, Ma∣dam, in that state: I remember full well every circum∣stance of our accidental meeting in America, since when, your image has never been absent from me; but it is with difficulty I credit my senfes, when they tell me I behold you in England, and, oh! transport∣ing thought! approach you with a claim that makes you mine for ever!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is exceedingly strange! but the Colonel, I find, as well as his servant, takes me for Charlotte: shall I undeceive him? will it not be cruel, now I find he loves me?—He will discover his error too soon, I fear.</P>
<STAGE>Aside.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mountf.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, Madam, am I to interpret these cold looks? With silent eloquence methinks they say, though you give me your hand, you have not a heart to bestow with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="34" REF="30"/>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>That would be ingratitude in the extreme, after the service you had render'd me; the obligation I owe you, Colonel, believe me, has sunk deep in my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mountf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Still, Madam, you dwell on the nature of your obligation to me; you owe me none: when I rescued you from captivity, I did no more than my duty as a soldier.—I cannot, will not, presume upon a service rendered by accident; no, Madam, nor will I ungenerously take advantage of your father's coun∣tenancing my addresses, if you do not approve of them.—This reserve, these embarrass'd looks, too plainly declare, you can never love me; though, thro' a false notion of justice, you would become the willing sacrifice of an ideal gratitude.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are certain circumstances, Colonel, which I cannot conceal—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mountf.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand you, Madam—your affections are fixed on another; if so, don't consider me as an obstacle to your wishes: I'll quit this house to∣morrow morning, nor ever more trouble you with my addresses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Generous, noble-minded fellow! <STAGE>Aside.</STAGE> It would be cruel, Colonel, not to set you right in one particular; but you may rest assur'd, you have no rival.</P>
</SP>

<P>May I then hope that you are not dis∣pleas'd at this unexpected meeting?</P>

<P>Ah, Colonel! give me your hand, my dear boy!—'Tis now ten years since I saw you; you were then a beardless strippling in a black gown and a square cap at Westminster.—Well, and how have you left his Londship? Is he as fond of old Hock, and toasting handsome wenches, as formerly?</P>
</SP>

<P>How is it possible you could have ex∣pected it?</P>

<P>I must confess it gives me much concern you have had the trouble of this long journey for nothing.</P>
</SP>

<P>For nothing do you call it, Sir?—I am come after a woman I'd pursue to the extremities of the earth.</P>

<P>Then you mean to pursue her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Certainly, Sir, else why did I come to your hourse?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bale.</SPEAKER>
<P>The night is very dark, Colonel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mountf.</SPEAKER>
<P>The night's very dark! and what's that to us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bale.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis no object, to be sure, as you are bent upon the matter—it's very unluckly—but we shan't have full moon these ten days.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mountf.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should suppose we had full moon to∣night, by your conversation.</P>
<STAGE>Aside.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bale.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Colonel! my daughter has acted a most artful part by me.—I never discovered how her incli∣nations were really disposed, till just before your ar∣rival.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mountf.</SPEAKER>
<P>And was not that time enough, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bale.</SPEAKER>
<P>Too late by six hours; had I the least suspi∣cion of it this morning—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mountf.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very glad you had not, as it might have been the cause of your making unnecessary preparations.—Miss Bale's reserve, on this occa∣sion, is strictly conformable to the natural delicacy of her sex.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bale.</SPEAKER>

<P>Then I am sure, Colonel, you can't be at a loss for a wife to your mind in these times.</P>
</SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mountf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I have.</P>

<P>In this room.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bale.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, my daughter Charlotte?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mountf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your daughter, Sir; and as a proof that I have seen her, her beauty is of that matchless nature, that to see her once, is to adore her eternally. 'Tis impossible I could have been mistaken; for you know we are old acquaintance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bale.</SPEAKER>
<P>How the devil should I know any such thing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mountf.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought she had told you of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bale.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never open'd her lips to me on the subject.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mountf.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is truly extraordinary!—Why, Sir, 'tis now above eight months since I first saw her; I never had her out of my thoughts since.—Nay, Sir, as a farther proof of what beauty like hers can do, Lieutenant Middleton, belonging to my own troop, was as much enamour'd at his first and only interview. —Poor fellow! he was trepann'd, some time ago, for a desperate wound he received a little above the temple, and has never since been rightly in his under∣standing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bale.</SPEAKER>
<P>It appears to me, that some more of the regiment has undergone the same operation.</P>
<STAGE>Aside.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mountf.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, I am perfectly satisfied with your daughter's reception of me—and now, as there is no bar in the way of my happiness, I'll act with the same freedom, as if I was already one of the fa∣mily —I have an old and most particular friend at Bath, whom my advice has brought into a very dis∣agreeable,
<PB N="38" REF="34"/>and rather delicate, situation; will you ex∣cuse me, Sir, for half an hour, whilst I go see him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bale.</SPEAKER>
<P>By all means.—And glad to get rid of you!</P>
<STAGE>Aside.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mountf.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall certainly be back to supper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bale.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's as you please, Colonel; mind I don't press you: I hope we have some little regard to good-breeding in the country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mountf.</SPEAKER>
<P>You'll apologize for me to my dear Char∣lotte?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bale.</SPEAKER>
<P>The moment I see her, depend upon it.— <STAGE>[<HI>Exit</HI> Colonel.]</STAGE>—Yes, he has been trepann'd, as well as the Lieutenant Middleton. I knew he was a devil of a fellow for sighting, but never heard a word of this stroke in his head.</P>

'Tis very unlucky that he's not here to ac∣company me—he'd be an excellent match for Sum∣mers, who is as hot-brain'd as himself.—But hold, is it safe to venture, without some one I can depend upon? I'm not like Old England, able to fight the whole world without an ally.—Admiral Dreadnought is to sup with me; so I'll wait till my friend comes, and then sally forth as bold as a lion.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word, there is something very prudish in that notion; what, never marry a second time?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>You misapprehend me; I do not cen∣sure the practice in others; I only say, that under the circumstances I found myself left a widow, it is im∣possible I can ever think of a second husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you have no family incumbrance, like other women; for my brother, the Admiral, out of regard to Captain Wilmot, has taken your son under his protection, and means to provide for him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is one reason out of many, why it appears to me I should not change my condition: Is it not to the merit of my deceased husband I owe the favour shewn to my son? Is it not to that husband's merit also, I am indebted for the asylum I enjoy under your brother's hospitable roof? if I could for∣get all the love I ever bore the dear partner of my heart, gratitude says I shou'd not insult the memory of a man, whose spirit seems still to attend me like a guardian angel, with a fondness that survives the grave.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, as my time is to come yet, I will not pretend to answer for my conduct when I become a widow; inexperienc'd young women often form rash refolutions, but marriage makes great changes in us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>It has often surpris'd me, Miss Kitty, how it happens that you have remain'd so long single?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>So long, Ma'am! I don't know what you mean by long, unless you think one shou'd marry in a bib and tucker.</P>

<P>Lord! what can one do with such an out of the way being as my brother? who never visits or sees

<P>I have just receiv'd a card of compliments, inviting you, Kitt, and the Widow, and myself to friend Bale's; I understand that his danghter lays her proper course at last, and is now bearing down Matrimony roads under flying top-sails.</P>

<P>Then Mr. Summers's hopes are all over, for I am positive old Bale wou'd never give his daughter to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dread.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no: poor Summers's hopes are all gone to the bottom; the vessel's designed for a com∣mander of quality; and I was sorry to hear it, for Summers is as honest a fellow as ever broke bisket: I wish he'd take you in tow, Kitt; he shou'd have five thousand down upon the binnacle, and as much more when death sets my anchor a peak.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord brother, how you confound me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dread.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are not fresh launch'd to be sure from boarding-school dock, but what of that? now its the fashion to paint the prow every morning, and hang out the colours of all nations in the rigging; an old hulk with a sheathing of gold, makes such a ginger∣bread appearance, that she'll pass for a new frigate.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have just heard from my son William, Sir: he desires his most respectful duty to his benefac∣tor, his second father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dread.</SPEAKER>
<P>Widow, I regard you, and I regard your son, for the sake of one, who is gone upon the voyage,
<PB N="44" REF="40"/>we must all sail without compass or pilot. I was lieutenant of the Ruby, when he was rated midship∣man on the same ship's books: from the day he board∣ed the French first-rate we took off Brazil, and killed the Captain and Lleutenant with his own cutlass, I said that he'd turn out one of those days a very brave fellow; and so he did; for when he knew it was his duty to fight, he never counted his guns, and their smoak prevented him from counting those of an enemy: he was always the first to form the line, the last out of action, and no man cou'd say, he ever disobeyed a signal; but his heart was oak, English oak to the centre, and, as if my brave friend cou'd never die, 'till that part was wounded, he was shot thro' it.</P>

<P>This woman is in a continual state of mutiny; she's harder to govern than a three-decker; she kept me in a storm for a long time about my servants; but old Cable Dreadnought was moor'd too fast to his opinion; I'll have none of your lazy lolloping land-lubbers about me, when I can get real seamen to do their business; honest fellows too that bear the marks of having served their country. She didn't like Locker, the butler, because he's dark of the larboard eye; we fought four glasses yard arm and vard arm, the day his upper works were damaged: he was then my boatswain, and I gave him charge of the cellar, that so brave a fellow may be always able to wet his whistle. My steward is a disabled purser, whose left hand was shot off in battle; and after that, I think the honor of his right may be relied on. I keep a groom, and two footmen, who are all reduc'd to their odd joints; then what better coachman could I fix upon than an old pilot? He has steer'd me safely thro'
<PB N="46" REF="42"/>many a rough sea, and hard gale; and whilst he has an eye in his head to see the compass, damn me! if I take the helm out of his hands.</P>

<P>My master is devilish gallant to-night!—When I found him so wonderfully taken with his mistress, nothing ran in my head but a warm kitchen fire-side, and the smoking hot prospect of a good supper—Then to be obliged to strike my tent, and march at a mo∣ment so critical!—I had just opened my first battery against the heart of the chamber-maid, a fine sprightly wench of eighteen, with a soft rolling blue eye, that sends every glance like a shot from a rifle-barrel.—It was curs'd unlucky, to be obliged to raise the siege, when I saw the Governor preparing to send out a flag of truce to surrender the garrison!</P>

<P>My dear Ma'am, I am under the greatest anxiety for you; have you heard from Miss Bale yet?</P>

<P>I expect Rachel with news every moment.</P>

<P>My dear Mrs. Wilmot, it is assisting me ma∣terially, to have a person in whom I can repose a confi∣dence.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Suppose I break the matter to the Ad∣miral, and strive to gain him over to your interest?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's a forlorn hope indeed!—My uncle proposed him to me for a husband; and, but for Charlotte's elopement, I should have had the old Ad∣miral,

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>You don't know, Ma'am, my good friend's character; was he even in love with you, and afterwards told of the mutual attachment between you and the Colonel, he would take a pride in resigning his pretensions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should not like to trust him.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is the true English seaman; rough as the element on which he once fought the battles of his country; but there is a tenderness of heart, and a greatness of soul about him, not always found under a more polished out-side.—He is a stranger to dissi∣mulation himself, and abhors it in others.—But in∣deed I have often observed, that the manners of British seamen are peculiar to themselves; as if there was something that mended the heart, and purified the mind, in the very air of the ocean.</P>

<P>Man is well express'd by the sun, before mar∣riage; but I'm of opinion, the moon has more to do with him afterward: did you never take an observa∣tion of that planet?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dread.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don' know how it is, Ma'am, but this conversation appears to me a kind of traverse sailing; and then a woman trims so sharp, she always gets the weather gage of me?</P>

<P>Madam, your wit enables you to fire two broadsides to my one; then let me aim a shot ever so well, it does no manner of execution, for want of strength in my powder: having obliged me therefore

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dread.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee, how?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>I made a solemn promise never to give my hand to any man, till she was disposed of to Mr. Summers; and here I make another promise, never to marry at all, if she's weded to the Colonel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>That bears very hard upon me.</P>

<P>It does not singly, Sir—my resolution is fix'd. Oh, that odious Colonel! it is he who has caus'd all our confusion: I am told that he has declared, he will not leave the house without a wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Say you so? I'll try him—I'll send him a challenge, and make him eat his words; or he shall blow old Cable out of the water.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not for the world! so precious do I hold your life, that to preserve it, I'd even break my promise and marry him myself?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dread.</SPEAKER>
<P>And leave me to founder! I tell you what, Ma'am, I'll make him an offer of my sister—He can't want a wife, more than she wants a husband? to my knowledge she has been these twenty years heaving out the lead, but never cou'd get into proper soundings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you think he'll have her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dread.</SPEAKER>
<P>If he wants a wife so much, he will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, do any thing but challenge him; try once more your influence with my uncle; 'twill break my heart if Charlotte's marriage with the Colonel shou'd oblige me to deny you.</P>

<P>Old and season'd as my own heart is, such an ac∣cident wou'd go near starting a plank in it. Well, Cable, you are come to your moorings at last—A wife has brought you too, and you'll have safe riding for the rest of your life in the Downs—But hold, cries master Prudence, is it calm weather always in that quarter? Wives are a kind of small craft, and when
<PB N="57" REF="53"/>they happen to carry but little ballast, a cap-full of wind oversets them.—Besides, you are an old vessel, Cable; fitter for a guard-ship than a convoy.—An old man of war may lie safe enough at the Nore, under doble anchors; and so may I at Bachelor's-Point with a single hauser; but should either of us part from our stations, and the land squalls freshen, why we may drive up in distress to Gravesend, and ground there.—Marriage is avoyage round the world; a man must expect to meet with all weathers before he completes it.—'Tis safe and pleasant enough till we pass the Cape of Good Hope; but it requires a ship without fault, and an able seaman, to double Cape Horn.</P>

<P>Eh! my eyes are none of the best; but if there be any dependance on them, that is my daugh∣ter Charlotte.</P>

<P>Now, Angelica, what do you think of the honour of your Colonel?</P>

<P>Did you take notice of the other young lady in company with Miss Bale?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bale.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly I did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mount.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you any objection to her continuing in the family a few days?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bale.</SPEAKER>
<P>Objection! Zounds! what objection can I possibly have?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mount.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why to-be sure, Sir, you can have no rea∣sonable objection; and yet it's not one man in a thou∣sand who wou'd be so indulgent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bale.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indulgent do you call it? Damme! if I'd bid her quit my house, if she chose to remain in it these twenty years.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mount. </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(Shaking him by the hand.)</STAGE>
<P>Truly, Sir, this is very kind, very kind of you indeed; and be as∣sured I shall ever gratefully remember the obligation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bale.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word this is very pleasant. But seriously, Colonel, do you think it such a favour, that I permit my niece to continue in the house with her cousin?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mount.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then, she's your niece?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bale.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only my brother's daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="64" REF="60"/>

<P>Oh, the devil! I have made a charming blunder, to bring a woman who had eloped, to the house of her uncle—I might as well have brought her to her father's.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bale.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am so perplex'd with false appearances on every side, that I cannot distinguish between the sha∣dow and the substance. Well, if Charlotte did elope, it is evident the Colonel knows nothing of the matter; and it's not my business to undeceive him— there is something very extraordinary in all this! and yet there may be method in it, if I cou'd find it out.</P>

<P>Summers! what a piece of assurance!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mount.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't be angry with him, Sir; for he never wou'd have come here, if I had n't suggested the scheme.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bale.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, then this was a scheme of your sug∣gesting?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mount.</SPEAKER>
<P>Entirely—and as he has taken up his quar∣ters with you, I hope you won't drive him out of the garrison.</P>

<P>There are certain quarters in Moorfields that I think will become your garrison.</P>

<P>Come, come, Mr. Bale, you must be poor Summers's friend—nay, I insist upon it.—If you knew how many good qualities he possessed, by Heaven! you wou'd regard him as a son.</P>

<P>Mr. Bale, you may think it extraordinary to see me in your house—but do not attribute my presence to either disrespect, or any intention of in∣jury; before I came here I was trepann'd by a false friend.</P>

<P>Was it at me, Summers, you levell'd that insinuation?</P>
</SP>

<P>At you, Mountford—once the friend of my bo∣som, who has stung my heart, because he was nearest to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mount.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was ever any thing so unreasonable as this man? I was just making your peace with Mr. Bale.</P>
</SP>

<P>Perfidious Hypocrite! do not attempt any longer to impose on my credulity—why did n't you avow the truth like a man, when you knew my pas∣sion for Charlotte?</P>

<P>He pretended love to your niece.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bale.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was all a pretence to impose upon you.</P>

<P>Dare you maintain to my face, Summers, that it is to the daughter of this gentleman your pretensions aspire?</P>

<P>Dare I?—I never will resign my claim to her, but with my life!</P>

<P>No, Mr. Bale—let him stay till I convince him that his passion for my dear Charlotte is ridicu∣lously ill-founded; as a proof of it, Summers, here I solemnly engage to resign all claim to her, if she gives you the preference.</P>

<P>Is this true, Ma'am?</P>

<P>Though matters are not taking the turn I could wish, there is something like the appearance of method at last.—Well, Colonel, as there can be no more mistakes, let me introduce you to the real Char∣lotte, who is to be your wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mount.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg leave to withdraw my claim, Sir, in favor of my friend Summers, who, I hope, is now convinc'd I never entertain'd a thought of taking his mistress from him. Your beauteous niece—</P>

<PB N="67" REF="63"/>
<SPEAKER>Bale.</SPEAKER>
<P>What the devil, Sir! are you going to annul the bargain between your father and me?—Besides, Sir, my beauteous niece is dispos'd of.</P>

<P>What! without my own consent?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mount.</SPEAKER>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bale.</SPEAKER>
<P>To my friend here, the Admiral—this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine old seaman; that, if all our Commanders were like him, not a power in Europe dare fire a gun upon the seas without the consent of England.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dread.</SPEAKER>
<P>Avast, avast! friend Bale!—Flattery is a quicksand, and let us steer clear of it.—The lady is about to be put in commission with a better officer. —When you propos'd the match to me, I knew no∣thing of there being younger claims in question; if I had, be assured I should not be so much out of my latitude.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bale.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, I am left in the lurch by all parties!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dread.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, when a fine young fellow, with a good fortune, is looking out for the fair wind of your consent to marry your daughter?—Friend Bale, for a long time I have had a great regard for you; but I am sorry to remark, that, in this case, you have put to sea more with a view to making a prize, than doing the duty which honor requires of you.—Some fathers treat their children as if they were trafficking in gold dust and elephants teeth, and had forgot that the slave trade was abolished in England.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bale.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[Takes <HI>Dread.</HI> aside]</STAGE>
<P>Between ourselves, Admiral, as my daughter went off with him, and this Colonel won't have her, I should have no objection to giving my consent, only I am afraid I shall lose my character for ever by it, as a man of method.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dread.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you'll gain a point in the other course, and establish your character as a man of understanding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bale.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Summers, as Charlotte appears deter∣min'd to have nobody but you, I'll let the Colonel see he shan't overturn all my calculations.—You shall have my daughter; but you must get into Par∣liament as fast as you can.—I expected to see a branch
<PB N="68" REF="64"/>of my family in the House of Peers; but I am deter∣min'd not to be shut out of both Houses.</P>

<P>You are come too late, Kitt; there's not a sweetheart left for you, unless my friend Bale will have you.</P>

<P>You take a pleasure, brother, in put∣ting me out of countenance.—Truly, if every body thought as little of the subject as I do!—</P>

<P>Come, come, Miss Kitty, don't be offended with the Admiral; now Charlotte's off my hands, I consider myself a spruce batchelor again, and if the fair Miss Dreadnought—</P>

<P>Mr. Bale, let me beg of you!—I assure you, Sir, this is conversation I have not been used to.</P>

<P>Colonel, give me your hand—we are friends once more. Take notice, Summers, that I have set down in the future arrangements of my family, a Bishop, and a General Officer.

[<HI>Looks at his watch.</HI>] Od'so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it is fifteen minutes past ten!—In consequence of the vicissitudes of this day, I shall sup later by an hour and a quarter than I have these twenty years.
