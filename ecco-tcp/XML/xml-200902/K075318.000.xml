<HEAD>NATURE in PERFECTION; OR, <HI>The MOTHER unveiled.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>LET hireling Poets ply their venal Lays,</L>
<L>The Great, the Pow'rful, and the Rich, to praise;</L>
<L>Let Male-contents with Satire tickled be,</L>
<L>And Love-sick Coxcombs sink in Simile:</L>
<L>A diff'rent Theme my Verses shall employ,</L>
<L>A Mother's Anguish, and a Mother's Joy.</L>
<L>And thou, O <HI>Bret!</HI> the softest of thy Kind,</L>
<L>Accept this Picture of a Parent's Mind;</L>
<L>If ever am'rous Plaint your Ear could please,</L>
<L>Or Love, or Pity, on your Bosom seize,</L>
<L>With fav'ring Smiles a well-meant Song regard,</L>
<L>And, Oh, forgive an unexperienc'd Bard,</L>
<L>If faintly he describe the Bliss, or Woe,</L>
<L>Which only you, who feel it, truly know.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From that sad Hour, when your unhappy Son</L>
<L>Struck thro the Life that forfeited his own,</L>
<L>What Doubts, what Fears, your anxious Soul posses'd,</L>
<L>And tore the soft Asylum of your Breast?</L>
<L>Oh, where for Shelter shall the Afflicted fly?</L>
<L>Or where expect a sweeter Sanctuary?</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="3"/>
Accus'd, forlorn, the much-lov'd Youth behold,</L>
<L>Depriv'd of Freedom, destitute of Gold;</L>
<L>Gold, that, from Dungeons, Criminals can free,</L>
<L>And ev'n in <HI>Newgate</HI> offers Liberty:</L>
<L>Prophets of Fate, where rav'nous Vulturs ply'd,</L>
<L>Cruel as Death, as Death unsatisfied;</L>
<L>Where Felons, Murd'rers, Traytors are secur'd,</L>
<L>And, if not guiltless, uncondemn'd immur'd;</L>
<L>Where thick built Walls th'imprison'd Wretch deprive</L>
<L>Almost of vital Air, while yet alive;</L>
<L>A Place, which scarce the Grave to which it leads,</L>
<L>In Damps, in Darkness, or in Stench exceeds.</L>
<L>How did your Kindness ease this Lot severe,</L>
<L>Your Fondness tend him, and your Bounty chear?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No Glympse of Joy your Pleasures then convey'd,</L>
<L>Nor Midnight Ball, nor Morning Masquerade.</L>
<L>In vain to crouded Drawing Rooms you run:</L>
<L>The Court a Desart seems without your Son.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If sportive Youth with sparkling Vigour come,</L>
<L>You see with secret Pain their opening Bloom.</L>
<L>Why was my Son (thus to yourself you say)</L>
<L>As young, and not so fortunate as they?</L>
<L>Nor sight of Age your Passion can endure:</L>
<L>—And must my Son then leave me immature?</L>
<L>Still others' Joys you view'd, and tasted none,</L>
<L>Still others' Griefs were lighter than your own;</L>
<L>And still whate'er you hear, whate'er you see,</L>
<L>Is cause for Plaint, and Food for Misery.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
<L>Your soft Distress, your Tenderness of Pain,</L>
<L>Can never be describ'd, or felt by Man;</L>
<L>Your <HI>Anna</HI> dear, taught by your matchless Mind,</L>
<L>Copies that glorious Frailty of her kind;</L>
<L>The Sister's Love, in Time of Danger shown,</L>
<L>Can only be transcended by your own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In his Defence mov'd your persuasive Tongue,</L>
<L>Excus'd the Rash, and pleaded for the Young.</L>
<L>You, Heav'n, and Earth sollicite on his Side,</L>
<L>No Friend unspoke to, and no Art untried.</L>
<L>Your Art, your Importunity is weak,</L>
<L>You move resistless, if the Mother speak.</L>
<L>How vainly I recall my num'rous Fears,</L>
<L>The Pains he cost me in his Infant Years!</L>
<L>Was it for this I bore him on my Knees?</L>
<L>Was all my Foresight, were my Throes for this?</L>
<L>Each pleasing Hope, that with his Life began,</L>
<L>All dash'd, preserv'd the Boy, but lost the Man.</L>
<L>Strike me, and spare my Child! Oh, let me save</L>
<L>The Life by Friendship, I by Nature gave!</L>
<L>So Birds, by Instinct taught, supply with Food,</L>
<L>And chear, with genial Warmth, their callow Brood,</L>
<L>And oft their kind, maternal Breasts expose,</L>
<L>To guard their helpless Young from threat'ning Foes,</L>
<L>Fearless, and fierce, unequal Fight maintain,</L>
<L>And dye themselves, e'er see their Offspring slain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Doom once past o'er his devoted Head,</L>
<L><HI>The Sword</HI> hangs, threat'ning, by a single Thread.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5"/>
While, bent with Chains, the Weight he scarcely bore,</L>
<L>Which gall'd the Wearer much, the Mother more,</L>
<L>Who can the Tortures of your Soul declare,</L>
<L>Your Noon-tide Labours, and your Mid-night Prayer?</L>
<L>Let meaner Friends to view the Pris'ner go,</L>
<L>Whose slighter Love can bear that Sight of Woe;</L>
<L>A Sight too shocking for a Mother's Eye,</L>
<L>Which yet your utmost Caution cannot flye:</L>
<L>Still to your Mind the darling Youth appears,</L>
<L>And racks your Bosom with tormenting Fears!</L>
<L>Present, where-e'er you move, the Phantom seems,</L>
<L>And haunts, with ghastly Shapes, your Morning Dreams!</L>
<L>The Scene of Justice, to your sleeping Eyes,</L>
<L>Stands terribly display'd—and now he dies!</L>
<L>Thick to your Heart the vital Currents run,</L>
<L>You start, and waking cry—My Son! My Son!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let none object you no Concern reveal'd,</L>
<L>Fire oft glows fiercest, that is most conceal'd:</L>
<L>Great Griefs are speechless, petty Sorrow speaks,</L>
<L>The Heart, which vents its Anguish never breaks;</L>
<L>Your Woes the old poetic Tales revive,</L>
<L>And Credit to their wildest Fables give.</L>
<L>So <HI>Niobe,</HI> when, in her Presence fell</L>
<L>The boasted Offspring she had lov'd too well,</L>
<L>Thro Horror stiff, beheld, with <HI>stupid</HI> Eye,</L>
<L>The last fair Rival of th' Immortals die;</L>
<L>While mightier Grief, than e'er by Words was shown,</L>
<L>Transform'd the silent Mourner to a <HI>Stone.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
<L>By Nature touch'd, his Pardon all desire,</L>
<L>And imitate the Virtue they admire,</L>
<L>Unite, his dire Misfortune to bemoan,</L>
<L>And join in Crowds to supplicate the Throne;</L>
<L>Who e'er the Mother view'd, her Offspring lov'd,</L>
<L>His Hundreds He, but She her Thousands mov'd;</L>
<L>From Breast to Breast contagious Mercy crept,</L>
<L>And Fops and Statesmen wonder'd why they wept!</L>
<L>Hearts hard before, unwonted Yearning know,</L>
<L>Ev'n Jaylers melted at a Mother's Woe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But see! he lives, whose Death you late deplor'd!</L>
<L>And angry Justice sheaths her awful Sword;</L>
<L>Unhop'd-for Joy th' Imperial Mercy brings,</L>
<L>Mercy, the best Prerogative of Kings.</L>
<L>With Triumph now you see the Tempest o'er,</L>
<L>With Raptures mighty, as your Grief before.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not so TYRCONNEL welcom'd the Relief,</L>
<L>Inferior in his Joy, as in his Grief;</L>
<L>Stranger to Motions of a Mother's Mind,</L>
<L>In Manners diff'rent, as in Kindred join'd.</L>
<L>Since for your Seed such Kindness you express,</L>
<L>Oh, may each Child give equal Happiness!</L>
<L>With boundless Gratitude your Bosom burns,</L>
<L>Your Taste for Pleasures, and for Court returns!</L>
<L>To Minds transported ev'ry Thing is gay,</L>
<L>And <HI>January</HI>'s self appears like <HI>May,</HI></L>
<L>Each Change of Time in Extacy is lost,</L>
<L>Nor Age feels Winter, nor <HI>December</HI> Frost.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="7"/>
Of bright, now brighter shine your lovely Eyes,</L>
<L>And, wing'd with Joy, th' exalted Spirits rise;</L>
<L>New Warmth, new Vigour to your Veins impart,</L>
<L>And dance tumultuous to your beating Heart.</L>
<L>But Oh, beware, and curb th' o'erflowing Tide,</L>
<L>For oft the Over-fortunate have died,</L>
<L>Whom Grief, in vain, had labour'd to destroy,</L>
<L>Surpris'd, unequal to Excess of Joy.</L>
<L>And ah! too far th' unwieldy Joy prevails,</L>
<L>For Life, itself, may sink when Reason fails!</L>
<L>Since oft so high your Extacies have grown,</L>
<L>You seem'd the Ties of Nature to disown;</L>
<L>Lost for a While to Mem'ry, you disclaim</L>
<L>A Child so dearly lov'd, and Mother's Name!</L>
<L>What dang'rous Transport parent Hearts may feel,</L>
<L>Let <HI>Ovid</HI> soft, the Lady's Poet, tell.</L>
<L>Thus old <HI>Agave,</HI> mad, denies her Boy,</L>
<L>Possess'd with frantic, <HI>Bacchanalian</HI> Joy,</L>
<L>Knows not his Form, but with distracted Roar,</L>
<L>Mistakes her Offspring for a Forest-Boar,</L>
<L>Runs to compleat his Death, exulting on,</L>
<L>And slays a Monster, while She kills her Son.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Soon as the short <HI>Delirium</HI> past you find,</L>
<L>And Sense regains it's Empire o'er the Mind,</L>
<L>You bless the Hand that eas'd your anxious Cares,</L>
<L>And pour for <HI>Brunswick</HI>'s House incessant Prayers!</L>
<L>Let the King live! (thus speaks your ardent Zeal!)</L>
<L>Long live, a Parent's Happiness to feel</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="9"/>
May Peace for ever bless the sacred Line,</L>
<L>That ev'ry Son may live, as well as mine!</L>
<L>Not equal Gladness o'er your Bosom spread;</L>
<L>When first the Infant bless'd your genial Bed.</L>
<L>Not half the Mother's Transport did you find,</L>
<L>For what is Body's Ease to Ease of Mind?</L>
<L>Nor when his Prattling did your Ears engage,</L>
<L>And promised Wonders in his riper Age;</L>
<L>Nor when the Race of Youth he gayly ran,</L>
<L>And rose thro' various Hazards up to Man,</L>
<L>As when Great <HI>Caesar</HI> spoke the Royal Word,</L>
<L>Which him to Life, and you to Peace restor'd,</L>
<L>Both by their Sov'reign's Favour born anew,</L>
<L>He twice a Son, and twice a Mother you.</L>
