<P>It may perhaps be necessary to ac∣quaint the reader, that Euripides has written a tragedy upon the same subject. In his <HI>Heraclidae,</HI> Macaria is sacrificed in the second act, and never afterwards mentioned; and <HI>Acamas</HI> is a mute. In∣deed the whole conduct of this play is so entirely different from that of the Greek poet, that the author is hardly conscious to himself of having borrowed any thing more from him, than the general idea of the <HI>Suppliants</HI> taking refuge in the temple, and Macaria's voluntary offer of her own life.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Written by a FRIEND.</BYLINE>
<L>WITH countenance thrice chang'd from red to pale,</L>
<L>Our author sends me forth to tell his tale;</L>
<L>Croesus said he—who rul'd those lands that lie—</L>
<L>Croesus—the Nabob of Antiquity:</L>
<L>When satiated with war, with wealth, with praise,</L>
<L>Defir'd new pleasures still to sooth his days;</L>
<L>And publish'd vast rewards (sure out of spite)</L>
<L>To him who should produce some new delight;</L>
<L>This flame unquench'd burns on from age to age,</L>
<L>Panting for novelty you seek our stage:</L>
<L>To please this taste, a classic bard will try,</L>
<L>To make soft bosoms heave a classic sigh;</L>
<L>Feel Deianira's faded charms, and trace</L>
<L>Alcides' godlike virtues in his race:</L>
<L>Hard is the task who strives your praise to gain,</L>
<L>And hard the part a poet must sustain.</L>
<L>Herculean labours might our Prologue fill,</L>
<L>And prove the club less powerful than the quill,</L>
<L>To clear the course, to turn the tide of wit,</L>
<L>To charm the watchful dragon of the pit;</L>
<L>The Hydra's hiss to check, the giants quell,</L>
<L>And bind the barking Cerberus of Hell,</L>
<L><PB REF="6"/>
Might the best strength of Hercules require,</L>
<L>Tho' to his force were added Orpheus' lyre:</L>
<L>Yet will we not despond—Alcides' race</L>
<L>In every one's remembrance holds a place;</L>
<L>The tale has trembled on each infant tongue,</L>
<L>The tale that Busby taught—that Dryden sung:</L>
<L>This night attend, one generous tear bestow,</L>
<L>To weep the hero's wrongs, the daughter's woe,</L>
<L>Like kind protectors grant the widow's suit,</L>
<L>And crown your poet with the golden fruit.</L>

<L>Spite of Eurystheus' spies,</L>

<L>Mother and daughter.</L>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Haem.</SPEAKER>
<L>Th' imperial widow there of great Alcides</L>
<L>Mourns, with a mourning universe, the fate</L>
<L>Of her illustrious lord; in whose sad tomb</L>

<L>Grant her, good heaven,</L>

<L>With toil and grief o'erpower'd,</L>
<L>Nature gives way, and in short broken slumbers</L>
<L>A transient respite feels. Through the lone ile,</L>
<L>At day-break, I drew near; and saw Macaria</L>
<L>With anxious tenderness scarce breathing o'er her,</L>
<L>A sigh, that would not be supprest, broke forth;</L>
<L>While from her eye, half-glimmering with a smile,</L>
<L>Stole such a tear as burnt upon my heart,</L>
<L>Strait I retired unseen. Oh, Iolaus,</L>

<L>Grief soon enough will rouse them. How I haste</L>

<L>Hopeless, she talks of hope; and would gild o'er</L>
<L>The sorrow that consumes her, with a smile,</L>
<L>In pity to her daughter. Oh, that fiend</L>
<L>Eurystheus! the detested cause of all!</L>
<L>Think of his fierce immitigable hate</L>
<L>To Hercules! Think with what fortitude</L>
<L>My noble sire sustained a life of labours,</L>

That savages would shrink from! And shall ven∣geance</L>
<L>Sleep, till the wretch exterminates our race?</L>

<L>My nature's rashness. I am calm again;</L>
<L>I'll listen to thy council, which has ever</L>

<L>Ah, what can I, alas, feeble old man!</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mac.</SPEAKER>
<L>Let her but hear thy voice. Alas, alas!</L>
<L>To wretchedness like her's, the very voice</L>
<L>Of friendship yields relief. Let her but see</L>
<L>Thy pitying eye, but not suffused with tears,</L>
<L>Thou good old man! no, dry thy tears, and speak,</L>
<L>Fallacious tho' they be, some lenient words</L>
<L>That sound like comfort. I the while will go—</L>
<L>Why shrinks my heart? Why faulters thus my tongue,</L>
<L>As Demophon were dangerous? I'll go to him.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Iol.</SPEAKER>
<L>Unknown! unguarded! go to Demophon</L>
<L>Uncalled! Thy heart, Macaria, well may shrink,</L>
<L>And thy tongue faulter. I have caught th' alarm.</L>
<L>Thy filial piety, too generous maid!</L>
<L>Unwarily betrays thee.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mac.</SPEAKER>
<L>Well I know</L>
<L>Thy friendly fears; he is not Acamas!</L>
<L>That high heroic spirit, who amongst</L>
<L>The foremost sons of Argos famous stood.</L>
<L>'Twas not in praise of Demophon, the tongue</L>
<L>Of fame grew lavish.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Iol.</SPEAKER>
<L>But from Acamas,</L>
<L>His brother, there's small hope: all kingly power</L>
<L>Is lodg'd in Demophon; be counsel'd then.</L>
<L>Till his heart's soften'd to receive thy suit,</L>
<L>Quit not the sanctuary.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mac.</SPEAKER>
<L>More forcibly</L>
<L>Than fear can counteract, an unseen hand</L>
<L>Urges me on. I feel, I fell within,</L>
<L>A more than mortal earnest of success;</L>
<L>Let not thy doubts oppose it. Oft I've heard,</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="12"/>
There is an eloquence in artless grief,</L>
<L>Of power to melt the sternest. I'll essay.</L>
<L>That power on Demophon.</L>

<SPEAKER>Iol.</SPEAKER>
<L>My words are vain.</L>
<L>Go then, Macaria, if it must be so,</L>
<L>Obedient to thy monitory call.</L>
<L>And, Dryas, thou, and ancient Amycus,</L>
<L>Silent attend the princess. You are suppliants,</L>
<L>Soliciting relief; let every look,</L>

<L>Alcander's order Thestor has obeyed;</L>

<L>Without a victim; when thy mortal foe</L>
<L>Th' Athenian army heads; when Acamas</L>
<L>The bold, th' intrepid, is gone forth to fight,</L>

<L>And is Alcander</L>
<L>Thus known? Vain augur, there will be no battle:</L>
<L>I sent forth Acamas; by my instructions</L>
<L>He heads th' Athenian army; at his will,</L>
<L>Alcander this tremendous hero moves,</L>
<L>The puppet of his pleasure. Demophon</L>
<L><PB N="47" REF="46"/>
Has fool'd his brother with a mock command;</L>

<L>Not to engage Eurystheus. Now believ'st thou</L>

<L>That's a device</L>

<L>The same instructions</L>
<L>Go to each chief; while Conon, the king's son,</L>

<BYLINE>Written by a FRIEND.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>WELL! these heroic times—I scarce can speak—</L>
<L>These ancient fables, borrow'd from the Greek,</L>
<L>Are all so full of passion, rage, and death,</L>
<L>So violent—they take away one's breath.—</L>
<L>Let me recover, pray:—this tragic strife</L>
<L>Night after night,—leads me a weary life.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thro' what variety of folks, long dead,</L>
<L>Through what strange times and beings are we led!</L>
<L>Now a fond daughter trembling for her sire;</L>
<L>Now Phaedra, burning with unlawful fire!</L>
<L>A heroine now, for Greece my brain I rack;</L>
<L>Now Desdemona, smother'd by a Black.</L>
<L>To take these various shapes, and fill the whole,</L>
<L>An actress needs a transmigrating soul.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This night, you'll own, I've had full cause to mourn</L>
<L>A chief renown'd from my embraces torn.</L>
<L>Well might a widow weep the best of men!</L>
<L>Oh! such a husband I shan't have again.</L>
<L>With bright renown he fill'd the Eastern climes,</L>
<L>And differ'd, ladies, from these modern times.</L>
<L>In life's first dawn, to deeds of terror bred,</L>
<L>The youthful hero crush'd the serpent's head.</L>
<L><PB N="68" REF="59"/>
In these our days, when men their object miss,</L>
<L>There are who like to hear the serpent hiss.</L>
<L>One thing there is, which I must not disguise;</L>
<L>Tho' brave, heroic, generous, and wise,</L>
<L>The lover, tam'd, aside his club could throw,</L>
<L>Chain'd to the distaff, like a modern beau.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet, all his toils and all his labours past,</L>
<L>By death ev'n Envy was subdued at last.</L>
<L>We read, (so says our bard) in Ovid's stile</L>
<L>How for himself he rais'd the funeral pile.</L>
<L>There on his club reclining,—like a guest</L>
<L>With garlands crown'd—he sunk to endless rest.</L>
<L>Yet even now, in these degenerate days,</L>
<L>Heroic virtue still can merit praise.</L>
<L>When round the ship, in the deep roaring tide,</L>
<L>Devouring flames advance on ev'ry side;</L>
<L>Lo! on the anchor where the hero lies,</L>
<L>With look serene, and still the foe defies,</L>
<L>He views the flame, he views the brawling wave,</L>
<L>Then sinks—undaunted sinks in glory's grave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>May his example every breast inspire,</L>
<L>And kindle thro' the land our antient fire.</L>
<L>For nought,—as Shakespeare sings, "can make us rue</L>
<L>"If Britain to herself will prove but true."</L>
