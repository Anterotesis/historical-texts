<HEAD TYPE="sub">A POEM.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>REASON, (a dame not often in the wrong)</L>
<L>Bethought, (for much to think is Reason giv'n)</L>
<L>On what is ill, and what is left undone,</L>
<L>And how dispos'd of all the gifts of Heav'n.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Perceiving Fortune off could fling her hood,</L>
<L>And stop to cast on knaves a partial eye,</L>
<L>And that when come where blushing merit stood,</L>
<L>Up went her bandage, and she pass'd him by.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
<L>Within a sacred grove (to peace consign'd)</L>
<L>A branch by Fortune from the Laurel torn,</L>
<L>Was straight into a graceful wreath entwin'd—</L>
<L>She said—"by Victory let this be worn!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To Victory the sculptur'd arch was rais'd</L>
<L>High o'er the smoaking ruins of a town!</L>
<L>And bells rang loud, and every window blaz'd,</L>
<L>And tuneful minstrels sang her vast renown.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And on her forehead Glory was inscrib'd</L>
<L>In glittering letters great of beaming gold,</L>
<L>Fair Honor's fount she seem'd to have imbib'd,</L>
<L>In sooth, her form was gracious to behold.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And blasts were puff'd from trump of vaunting Fame,</L>
<L>That Justice to her had the wreath decreed!</L>
<L>Yet Reason doubts the gay Virago's claim,</L>
<L>If <HI>sans</HI> desert, why wear the lib'ral meed?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
<L>Let Emulation for that wreath contend!</L>
<L>Let youthful ardour pant to reach the goal!</L>
<L>A gilded prize may be the purpos'd end,</L>
<L>Or fierce Ambition only fire the soul.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In proud cathedrals why Te Deum raise?</L>
<L>Say, why to Victory the choral joy?</L>
<L>Such songs, indeed, were pure immortal praise,</L>
<L>Did God create for man but to destroy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Her conquests, rapine are!" sage Reason cry'd—</L>
<L>"Her flash of Glory, all illusive! vain!</L>
<L>"Her fair-fac'd Honor, fallacy and pride,</L>
<L>"And crimson slaughters do her hands distain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Should light-heel'd Vanity for trinkets pine,</L>
<L>"She makes of Victory a pliant tool,</L>
<L>"To work a star or riband wondrous fine,</L>
<L>"Reward of coward—knave, or valiant fool.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
<L>"Before the rustic youth can form a choice,</L>
<L>"Some trick conveys him to a foreign land,</L>
<L>"By custom braz'd, in carnage can rejoice,</L>
<L>"The brutal hero of a cut-throat band!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"The perfect gen'ral shews his needled star,</L>
<L>"The mangled private may go hang or beg,</L>
<L>"Dispute his charter to the trade of war,</L>
<L>"He swears, and shews it in his wooden leg.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Fire! pest! and famine doth she give mankind,</L>
<L>"Is Vict'ry then the Laurel won by thee?</L>
<L>"The sovereign good, O Wisdom! let me find,</L>
<L>"I hold this evergreen her honor'd fee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"'Tis Charity that wipes the briny tear,</L>
<L>"Which Vict'ry bids adown the cheek to flow,</L>
<L>"That lifts with smiles the mourner from the bier,</L>
<L>"And puts aside the bitter cup of woe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
<L>"Perish her hopes of Industry the bane!</L>
<L>"That turn the ploughshare to a murd'rous sword,</L>
<L>"And make the ruffian, once a simple swain!</L>
<L>"Atchieve exploits by earth and heaven abhorr'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"The husband and the parent she hath slain!</L>
<L>"Widows and orphans Victory hath made!</L>
<L>"Untill'd, nor waving ears adorn the plain,</L>
<L>"For Desolation marks her ruthless trade."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Few know where bashful Charity doth hide,</L>
<L>Full seen of Heav'n, she shrinks from mortal ken,</L>
<L>And many a devious round, and far and wide</L>
<L>Did Reason seek her, 'mid the haunts of men.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Quoth Wisdom, "Reason, thou'rt as Fortune blind!</L>
<L>"For just decision idly thus to roam,</L>
<L>"When Charity, beneficent and kind,</L>
<L>"Dwells near at hand, and OATLANDS is her home.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
<L>"'Tis not alone with paltry gold to part,</L>
<L>"Or chase pale sorrow from the cottage door,</L>
<L>"She there, stores treasur'd moral in the heart,</L>
<L>"God's own appointed agent for the poor."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Blithe on a velvet turf of mossy green,</L>
<L>Where Naïds from the silver Thames resort,</L>
<L>Surrounded by her playful charge was seen,</L>
<L>The lovely mistress
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Dutchess of York.</NOTE> of their harmless sport.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Far Vice and Folly fly at her command!</L>
<L>And sure success attends her sweet employ,</L>
<L>And as the mental buds to flowers expand,</L>
<L>She views her labours with a mother's joy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To little acts let great ones lowly bend,</L>
<L>Where rank by pride is only understood;</L>
<L>To works angelic her white thoughts ascend,</L>
<L>Aspiring to the height of doing good.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
<L>Reason convinc'd, that Charity benign,</L>
<L>Of OATLAND's grove had made her lov'd retreat,</L>
<L>Bade Victory her Laurel Crown resign,</L>
<L>To lie at beauteous FREDERICA's feet!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nature her noblest task had well perform'd,</L>
<L>Endow'd the babe with intellectual grace,</L>
<L>The lambent spark that all his bosom warm'd,</L>
<L>Shone full confess'd in air, shape, limb, and face.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In culture, Fortune! take an ample share!</L>
<L>Or else the plant may wither in the bloom:</L>
<L>Why genius (that with Phosper might compare)</L>
<L>Condemn to waste? a lamp within the tomb!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not that each shrub can hang with golden fruit,</L>
<L>Or roses issue from the humble sod,</L>
<L>But Reason best can lift him from the brute,</L>
<L>When man shall know that he's the work of God.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
<L>Or say, that nature leaves her work most crude,</L>
<L>Still more it stands in need of polish'd aid,</L>
<L>Untaught, we view our kind, a savage rude,</L>
<L>And wonder at the monster we have made.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But wealth can cherish! draw the talents forth,</L>
<L>A sun! which Fortune's cold neglect supplies,</L>
<L>Then more than mines the bounteous heart is worth,</L>
<L>That gives what sordid penury denies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hail, heavenly FREDERICA! God of all,</L>
<L>Pour every blessing on the gentle fair!</L>
<L>Should ills assail, anticipate her call,</L>
<L>Who takes the helpless infant to her care.</L>
