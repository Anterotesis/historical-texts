<L>SEV'N days were past, when Lamachus ap∣pear'd</L>
<L>Before Mardonius. Mighty chief, he said,</L>
<L>I hasted to Themistocles, and spoke</L>
<L>Thy friendly words. His answer first imply'd</L>
<L N="5">No more, than cold acceptance of the terms</L>
<L>For Mindarus. At length two hundred, prime,</L>
<L>Of all his num'rous captives, he releas'd;</L>
<L>His minister, Sicinus, in the ship,</L>
<L>Which landed me, detains them near the port,</L>
<L N="10"><PB N="2" REF="4"/>
Till Haliartus, and the promis'd gold</L>
<L>Are lodg'd on board. Themistocles himself</L>
<L>Was bound to Athens with his menial train,</L>
<L>His wife and race. We parted on the shore.</L>
<L>To me, repeating in a whisper'd tone</L>
<L N="15">Thy proffers large, he scornful thus reply'd:</L>
<L>"The spoils of Asia will exceed her gifts."</L>
<L>Then loud thy brave defiance I pronounc'd.</L>
<L>He with redoubled arrogance thus brief:</L>
<L>"Rouse thy new master; else the plains of Thebes</L>
<L N="20">"I may attain before him." Fir'd with rage</L>
<L>Mardonious here: If Athens do not send</L>
<L>By Alexander's mouth submission low,</L>
<L>She shall become the spoil of Asian flames,</L>
<L>Themistocles spectator of the blaze.</L>
<L N="25">Be swift; yon Greek for Mindarus exchange;</L>
<L>Two hundred talents promis'd shall be paid;</L>
<L>These ransom'd warriors I appoint my guard;</L>
<L>Brave Mindarus their captain. Stern he ends;</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="5"/>
In open fight th' Athenian to confront</L>
<L N="30">Magnanimous he burns; his heated soul</L>
<L>Yields to delusion of that subtle chief,</L>
<L>Wise like the serpent gliding through a brake,</L>
<L>When his empoison'd jaws in silence steal</L>
<L>On some incautious woodman, who, on toil</L>
<L N="35">Intent, exerts his brawny strength, nor deems</L>
<L>A foe is nigh, nor hears him, nor perceives,</L>
<L>Till sore the death-inflicting wound he feels.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A summons swift for embarkation flies</L>
<L>To Haliartus. With regret he leaves</L>
<L N="40">Dear friends, but dearer his Acanthè's love,</L>
<L>More prevalent his constant zeal for Greece</L>
<L>Combine to sooth his pain. They wing his speed</L>
<L>To good Sicinus, who, the ransom'd train</L>
<L>Discharging, tow'rds Euboea steers the keel</L>
<L>With Persian treasure fraught. The ev'ning clos'd,</L>
<L N="46">When by a hasty mandate to the son</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="6"/>
Of Gobryas, Lamachus was call'd. The chief</L>
<L>In perturbation of indignant wrath</L>
<L>Was striding o'er the carpet, which bespread</L>
<L>His rich pavilion's floor. His words were these:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="51">The Macedonian king is just arriv'd</L>
<L>From Athens; I have seen him. Dost thou know,</L>
<L>That supercilious populace hath spurn'd</L>
<L>My condescension, menac'd ev'n a prince,</L>
<L N="55">Their host, for proff'ring kindness in my name.</L>
<L>Such my reward. To all th' Ionian Greeks,</L>
<L>The seed of Athens, I, when victor, left</L>
<L>Their democratic rule and laws unchang'd;</L>
<L>But I will cut all freedom by the roots</L>
<L N="60">From man's ungrateful race. The wily Greek</L>
<L>Insinuating fram'd this brief reply:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Perhaps the name of Xerxes may offend</L>
<L>Th' Athenian tribes. Might Europe once behold</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="7"/>
The son of Gobryas thron'd, then... Ha! proceed,</L>
<L N="65">Mardonius answer'd. Lamachus again:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Doth not all Aegypt, doth not Libya's clime,</L>
<L>With Asia vast, afford redundant sway</L>
<L>To gratify one monarch? First of men,</L>
<L>Why may not Thrace, with Macedonia's realm,</L>
<L N="70">Thessalia, Greece, whate'er thy mighty arm</L>
<L>Shall rend by conquest from the western world,</L>
<L>Become thy prize? They willing might accept</L>
<L>A sov'reign like Mardonius. Try their choice.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Away—Mardonius spake; and frowning bade</L>
<L N="75">The Greek retire. Now left alone he mus'd,</L>
<L>Thus questioning his heart: Aspiring thoughts,</L>
<L>Do ye awaken at the coz'ning touch</L>
<L>Of this vile tempter? Honour, while my ear</L>
<L N="79">Detests th' adviser, fortify my breast</L>
<L>Against th' advice—Enough—More swiftly drive,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="8"/>
Dull night, thy sooty wheels; come, active morn,</L>
<L>Then to the field, Mardonius. Conquer now;</L>
<L>Deliberate hereafter on the spoil.</L>
<L>But thou may'st perish—perish, and the gifts</L>
<L N="85">Of fortune change to everlasting fame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A sudden trumpet strikes his ear; he sees</L>
<L>Masistius nigh. So breaks the polar star</L>
<L>Through night's unrav'ling canopy of clouds</L>
<L>On some bewilder'd sailor to correct</L>
<L N="90">His erring course. Amidst a warm embrace</L>
<L>Began Mardonius: O, in season come,</L>
<L>Thou more, than half myself! my strength decays,</L>
<L>My talents languish, ev'n my honour sleeps,</L>
<L>When thou art far. Masistius calm replies:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="95">I have compos'd Pallene's late revolt</L>
<L>Through all the district; Potidaea's walls</L>
<L>Alone resisted; from whose small domain</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="9"/>
O'erflow'd by tides the army I withdrew.</L>
<L>I come, Mardonius, not to hear a tale</L>
<L N="100">Of languid talents, or of strength decay'd,</L>
<L>Much less of honour sleeping in thy breast,</L>
<L>When I am absent. Honour on a rock</L>
<L>Immoveable is fix'd; its solid base</L>
<L>The billowy passions beat in vain, nor gusts</L>
<L>Of fortune shake; support from none it wants,</L>
<L N="106">Firm in itself. Some augury, or dream</L>
<L>Inexplicably dark, o'erclouds thy mind;</L>
<L>Resume thy native manliness, O chief,</L>
<L>Whose loyal faith the mightiest king entrusts</L>
<L>With all his pow'r and splendour, save the crown.</L>
<L N="111">Prepare to pass Thermopylae, and bring</L>
<L>Our labours to decision. Gobryas' son</L>
<L>Compares the language of his spotless friend</L>
<L>With his own devious thoughts, and turns aside</L>
<L N="115">In blushing silence; but, recover'd, sends</L>
<L>His mandate forth to march by rising dawn.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
<L>Not with a less commotion in his soul</L>
<L>From diff'rent cares Emathia's prince resorts</L>
<L>To Amarantha. On her beauteous neck</L>
<L N="120">In conjugal affection, yet in grief</L>
<L>Unutterable long he hangs. Alas!</L>
<L>My lord, she said, though early I presag'd</L>
<L>Thy embassy abortive, hath it prov'd</L>
<L>Disastrous? Yes, her agonizing spouse</L>
<L>Return'd; what more disastrous, than reproach</L>
<L N="126">Among the old, hereditary friends</L>
<L>Of my forefathers! Amarantha, lend</L>
<L>Attention; amply shall my tongue relate</L>
<L>Events impress'd too deeply on my heart.</L>
<L N="130">I went to Athens; Aristides call'd</L>
<L>Her various tribes; the image of a god</L>
<L>Was he presiding. Innocent, at least</L>
<L>Intentionally guiltless, I began;</L>
<L>Good will to Athens prompted ev'ry word:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
<L>Impow'r'd by Xerxes, thus Mardonius greets</L>
<L N="136">You, men of Athens. Repossess your soil,</L>
<L>Enlarg'd dominion from the royal hand</L>
<L>Ask and obtain; be govern'd by your laws;</L>
<L>The son of Gobryas will rebuild your fanes;</L>
<L N="140">Accept the king's alliance, and be free</L>
<L>With added strength and splendour. Me receive,</L>
<L>Illustrious people, offspring of the soil</L>
<L>Which you inhabit. Not a guest unknown</L>
<L>In Athens, I, your Macedonian host,</L>
<L N="145">Of warm, unchang'd affection to your state,</L>
<L>Salvation bring, prosperity, and peace.</L>
<L>Reflect, what numbers of subjected Greeks,</L>
<L>Some ancient foes to Athens, others friends,</L>
<L>But now constrain'd, with Xerxes are ally'd.</L>
<L N="150">The small remainder unsubdu'd consult</L>
<L>Their own defence. Are Spartans in the field?</L>
<L>Your produce, indefatigable race,</L>
<L>Your new-built mansions to a second waste</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="12"/>
Of flames, your wives, your progeny, they leave</L>
<L N="155">To want and rapine. Singly can you face</L>
<L>Half Greece, all Asia, leagu'd against your weal?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh! Amarantha, frowns on ev'ry brow</L>
<L>Indignant lowr'd around me. Present there</L>
<L>Was Aëmnestus from Laconia's state;</L>
<L N="160">He, who, unaw'd by Xerxes on his throne,</L>
<L>Strange retribution claim'd, and sternly chose</L>
<L>Mardonius' self the victim to appease</L>
<L>Leonidas. Th' Athenians he address'd:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Invading Sardis to enlarge your sway,</L>
<L N="165">"Athenians, you are authors of a war,</L>
<L>"Which now extends to all of Grecian blood;</L>
<L>"Ill would it then become you to desert</L>
<L>"The gen'ral cause. To servitude resign'd</L>
<L>"By you, a double shame the Greeks would cast</L>
<L N="170">On Athens, known of old and often prov'd</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="13"/>
"By arms and counsel to redeem and guard</L>
<L>"The liberty of nations. I condemn</L>
<L>"Like you my tardy countrymen; will bleed</L>
<L>"Not less for you, than Sparta. Soon, I trust,</L>
<L N="175">"She will arrange her phalanx on the field;</L>
<L>"Else to your vengeance I devote my head.</L>
<L>"Meantime your wives and offspring ev'ry state</L>
<L>"In love will cherish. Attic ears, be shut</L>
<L>"To this deceiver; his condition calls</L>
<L N="180">"On him to plead for tyranny; himself</L>
<L>"Wields a despotic scepter, petty lord</L>
<L>"Of feeble Macedon, and Persia's slave."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Severe and awful Aristides rose;</L>
<L>His manners still urbanity adorn'd:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="185">"Ambassador of Sparta," he began,</L>
<L>"Us thou hast charg'd as authors of the war,</L>
<L>"Yet dost extol our vigour in redress</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="14"/>
"Of injur'd states. Th' Ionians were enslav'd,</L>

<L>"A prince, distinguish'd as her host and friend;</L>
<L N="221">"Meantime I pity thy dependent state."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Loud acclamations hurried from the sight</L>
<L>Of that assembly thy dejected spouse,</L>
<L>In his own thoughts dishonour'd. What a lot</L>
<L N="225"><PB N="14" REF="16"/>
Is mine! If Xerxes triumph, I become</L>
<L>A slave in purple; should the Greeks prevail,</L>
<L>Should that Euboean conqueror, the son</L>
<L>Of Neocles be sent th' Athenian scourge. . . .</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hear, and take comfort, interpos'd the queen.</L>
<L N="230">To thee I come for counsel, sigh'd her lord;</L>
<L>I will repose me on thy breast, will hear</L>

<L>Thy love, thy charms can sooth my present cares,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>That Greece will triumph, rest assur'd; no force</L>
<L N="236">Of these untaught Barbarians can resist</L>
<L>Her policy and arms. Awhile, dear lord,</L>
<L>We must submit to wear the galling mask</L>
<L>Necessity imposes. New events</L>

To all men gracious, Aristides serv'd</L>
<L>By us in season will befriend our state.</L>

<L>This said, her star-like beauty gilds his gloom,</L>
<L>While round them heav'n his midnight curtain drops.</L>
<L N="246">By rising dawn th' Oetaean rocks and caves</L>
<L>Ring with ten thousand trumps and clarions loud.</L>
<L>With all his host the son of Gobryas leaves</L>
<L>His empty'd camp. So rushes from his den</L>
<L>The strong and thick-furr'd animal, who boasts</L>
<L N="251">Calisto's lineage; bound in drowsy sloth</L>
<L>Bleak winter he exhausts; when tepid spring</L>
<L>His limbs releases from benumbing cold,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>The bands entire of Persians and of Medes,</L>

<L>Compose the army. Forty myriads sweep</L>
<L>Thy pass, renown'd Thermopylae, to rush</L>
<L N="260">On Grecian cities scatter'd in their view.</L>
<L>So by the deep Borystenes in floods</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="18"/>
Of frothy rage, by mightier Danube's wave,</L>
<L>Nor less by countless congregated streams,</L>
<L>The Euxine swoln, through Hellespontine straits</L>
<L N="265">Impels his rapid current; thence extends</L>
<L>Among th' Aegean isles a turbid maze.</L>
<L>Three days the multitude requir'd to pass</L>
<L>The rough defile. Masistius in the van</L>
<L>His sumptuous arms, and all-surpassing form</L>
<L N="270">Discovers. Tiridates leads the rear</L>
<L>Clos'd by the troops of Macedon, whose king</L>
<L>Sat on a car beside his radiant queen.</L>
<L>Amid the center, on a milk-white steed,</L>
<L>Mardonius rode in armour, plated gold</L>
<L>Thick set with gems. Before him march'd a guard</L>
<L N="276">Of giant size, from each Barbarian tribe,</L>
<L>For huge dimension, and terrific mien,</L>
<L>Preferr'd. Their captain, from his stature nam'd</L>
<L>Briareus, born on Rhodope, display'd</L>
<L N="280">That hundred-handed Titan on his shield.</L>
<L>He swung around an iron-studded mace,</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="19"/>
In length ten cubits; to his shoulders broad</L>
<L>The hairy spoils of hunted bears supply'd</L>
<L>A shaggy mantle; his uncover'd head</L>
<L>Was bald, except where nigh the brawny neck</L>
<L N="286">Short bushy locks their crisped terrors knit.</L>
<L>So his own mountain through surrounding woods</L>
<L>Lifts to the clouds a summit bare and smooth</L>
<L>In frost, which glistens by no season thaw'd.</L>
<L N="290">Not such is gentle Mindarus behind</L>
<L>In argent mail. Unceasing, on his shield</L>
<L>Intent, Cleora newly painted there</L>
<L>A living beauty, but another's prize,</L>
<L>He views, while hopeless passion wastes the hue</L>
<L N="295">Of his fair cheek, and elegance of form.</L>
<L>Not less th' unrivall'd Amarantha's eyes</L>
<L>Had pierc'd the son of Gobryas. Instant sparks</L>
<L>On her appearance from Nicaea first</L>
<L>Had kindled warm desire, which absence cool'd,</L>
<L N="300">While she in distant Macedon abode.</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="20"/>
When winter melted at the breath of spring,</L>
<L>Her sight again amid th' assembling host</L>
<L>Reviv'd the fervour of an eastern breast</L>
<L>By nature prone, by wanton licence us'd,</L>
<L N="305">To am'rous pleasures. Public duty still</L>
<L>Employ'd his hours; still smother'd was the flame,</L>
<L>Nor on his wishes had occasion smil'd.</L>
<L>Ev'n in the absence of Aemathia's prince</L>
<L>At Athens, friendship's unremitted care</L>
<L N="310">Still in Sandaucè's chamber held the queen</L>
<L>Sequester'd, inaccessibly immur'd.</L>

<L>Beside Masistius rode a youthful page</L>

Masistius priz'd her token of esteem</L>

<L>O father of Melissa, should my pow'r</L>

Thy daughter's guidance—Fly, Statirus, post</L>

<L>The sun is low; not ent'ring yet the vale,</L>

<L>Thessalia's chieftain, faithless Greek, approv'd</L>
<L>The Persian's friend, with him th' unwilling prince</L>
<L N="346">Of Macedon, to whom the gen'ral thus:</L>

<L>The Isthmus; watch the Spartan motions there.</L>
<L N="351">Thou, Alexander, sweep the furthest bounds</L>
<L>Of Locris, Doris, Phocis; all their youth</L>

<L N="395">Massistius born to virtue, and refin'd</L>

<L>What hast thou done, Mardonius? When I led</L>

But if thou bear'st the conscience of a deed</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>I have meant wrong, not acted, said the chief.</L>
<L>Greece once produc'd a Helen, who forsook</L>
<L>A throne and husband; what these later dames</L>

<L N="5">I found her tent abandon'd; but her course</L>

<L>These words, evincing nature's purest gifts,</L>
<L>Deserving that society sublime</L>

Her cruel sport, Mardonius, need we tempt</L>

Internal virtue; friendship on my part</L>

<L>Disdain'd. Your own ambassador pronounc'd</L>

While Athens burns, while sacrilege invades</L>
<L>Our temples, while our ancestors we see</L>
<L>Torn from the grave? Pausanias, thou disgrace</L>
<L>To thy forefather Hercules, whose arm,</L>
<L>To friends a bulwark, was a scourge to foes,</L>
<L N="410">What hast thou said? But, guardian to the son</L>

<L>Beyond the isthmus, and for Greece expir'd,</L>
<L>If thou retain'st no rev'rence for his blood,</L>
<L>If thou dost scorn Lycurgus and his laws,</L>
<L N="415">If holding liberty an empty name,</L>
<L>Art now in treaty with a lawless king,</L>
<L>No more of words. Athenians have their choice</L>
<L>To treat with Xerxes, or to distant climes</L>
<L>Expand the sail, resigning to their fate</L>
<L N="420">Unfaithful, timid Grecians, who have lost</L>

We in that noble warfare will refuse</L>
<L N="425">No hardship—Ev'n thy arrogant command</L>
<L>I like the meanest soldier will abide.</L>

<L>Then Aëmnestus brief: O righteous man,</L>
<L>I feel thy wrongs; Laconia's shame I feel,</L>
<L>Which if delay still blackens, thou shalt lead</L>
<L N="430">Me, the due victim of Athenian wrath,</L>

<L>His Attic friend: Our citizens are march'd;</L>
<L>All night my indefatigable toil</L>

<L>He, ever true to equity, applauds,</L>
<L N="445">Who their disgraceful sloth in council blam'd.</L>
<L>Subordination, silent order held</L>
<L>Each in his place; in look, as virgins, meek,</L>

His wonted rider, than admits the rein;</L>

<L>But tell me, son of Gobryas, whither flown</L>
<L>Was all thy magnanimity, when flames</L>
<L>A second time laid stately Athens low?</L>
<L>Though disappointed, couldst thou deem a crime</L>
<L N="491">Her constancy, refusing to betray</L>
<L>A common cause? Mardonius, thou dost hope</L>
<L>To conquer; why a city of renown,</L>

<L>By intercourse with yon religious hill</L>

<L>In single combat on the listed field</L>
<L>O'erthrew the invader Hyllus, and preserv'd</L>
<L>Unspoil'd the land of Pelops, we obtain'd</L>
<L>From all her sons unanimous this post,</L>
<L N="130">Whene'er united in a common cause</L>
<L>They march'd to battle. Not with you we strive,</L>
<L>Ye men of Sparta, at your choice command</L>

<L>From Athens; brave and prosp'rous we have join'd</L>
<L>Our banners oft with yours; our deeds you know;</L>
<L N="136">To ours superior what can Athens plead</L>
<L>Of recent date, or ancient? for what cause</L>
<L>Should we our just prerogative resign?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then Aristides spake: Collected here</L>
<L N="140">Are half the Grecians to contend in arms</L>
<L>With Barbarous invaders, not in words</L>

Each with the other for precedence vain.</L>
<L>From his own volume let the tongue of time,</L>
<L>Not mine, proclaim my countrymen's exploits</L>
<L N="145">In early ages. In his course he views</L>
<L>The varying face of nature, sea to land,</L>
<L>Land turn'd to sea, proud cities sink in dust,</L>
<L>The low exalted, men and manners change,</L>
<L>From fathers brave degen'rate sons proceed,</L>
<L N="150">And virtuous children from ignoble sires.</L>
<L>What we are now, you, Grecians, must decide</L>
<L>At this important crisis. Judges, fix</L>
<L>On Marathon your thoughts, that recent stage</L>
<L>Of preservation to the public weal,</L>
<L N="155">Where fifty nations, arm'd to conquer Greece,</L>
<L>We unassisted foil'd; more fresh, the day</L>
<L>Of Salamis recall. Enough of words;</L>
<L>No more contention for the name of rank;</L>
<L>The bravest stand the foremost in the sight</L>
<L N="160">Of gods and mortals. As to you is meet,</L>
<L><PB N="72" REF="74"/>
Determine, Spartans; at your will arrange</L>
<L>Th' Athenians; they acknowledge you the chiefs</L>
<L>Of this great league, for gen'ral safety fram'd,</L>
<L>Wherever plac'd, obedient they will fight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="165">The sense of all his countrymen he breath'd,</L>
<L>Who for the public welfare in this hour</L>
<L>Their all relinquish, and their very pride</L>
<L>A victim yield to virtue. From his seat,</L>
<L>Inspir'd by justice, Aemnestus rose:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="170">Brave as they are, our friends of Tegea seem</L>
<L>To have forgot the Marathonian field,</L>
<L>The Salaminian trophies; else this strife</L>
<L>Had ne'er alarm'd the congregated host</L>
<L>Of states so various and remote. As brief</L>
<L N="175">Callicrates subjoins: Not less our friends</L>

Within the isthmus is confin'd, the gift</L>
<L>Of part, not binding universal Greece.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Athenian moderation had before</L>
<L N="180">Won ev'ry Spartan; loud they sound the name</L>
<L>Of Athens, Athens, whose pretension just</L>
<L>The general confirms, restoring peace.</L>
<L>So in a chorus full the manly bass</L>
<L>Directs the pow'r of harmony to float</L>
<L N="185">On equal pinions, and attune the air.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now Sparta's wide encampment on the right</L>
<L>Was form'd; sedate and silent was the toil,</L>
<L>As is the concourse of industrious ants,</L>
<L>In mute attention to their public cares.</L>
<L N="190">Extending thence, successive states erect</L>
<L>Their standards. On the left their num'rous tents</L>
<L>Th' Athenians pitch. In labour not unlike</L>
<L>The buzzing tenants of sonorous hives,</L>
<L><PB N="74" REF="76"/>
Loquacious they and lively cheer the field,</L>
<L N="195">Yet regularly heed each signal giv'n</L>
<L>By staid commanders. Underneath a fringe</L>
<L>Of wood, projecting from Cithaeron's side,</L>
<L>Ascends the chief pavilion. Seated there</L>
<L>Is Aristides at a frugal board,</L>
<L N="200">An aged menial his attendant sole;</L>
<L>But from the tribes selected, round him watch</L>
<L>An hundred youths, whose captain is the son</L>

<L>His arms th' Athenian patriot in his tent</L>

<L>I am obedient to the man, who holds</L>

<L>My sole adviser. Haughty and morose,</L>

<L>A battle, not th' invaded, who must watch</L>

<L N="225">Retain, that Greece is center'd in this host,</L>

<LG>
<L>The sun was set; th' unnumber'd eyes of heav'n</L>
<L>Thin clouds envelop'd; dusky was the veil</L>
<L>Of night, not sable; placid was the air;</L>
<L N="235">The low-ton'd current of Asopus held</L>
<L>No other motion than his native flow,</L>
<L>Alluring Aristides in a walk</L>
<L>Contemplative to pace the stable verge</L>
<L>Attir'd in moss. The hostile camp he views,</L>

<L>For this the groves of Jupiter supreme</L>

<L N="245">Square was th' inclosure, ev'ry face emblaz'd</L>

Mardonius, thine, from coronets of lamps</L>

<L>Lord of Olympus! didst thou want the pow'r,</L>

The parting words of Artemisia bear,</L>

<L>I shall despair, Masistius, if thou fall'st,</L>

<L>While, as I pass, the crouding myriads shout,</L>

<L>WHILE thus Mafistius for the field prepar'd,</L>

But suppliants. Hegesistratus accosts</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Priest of Boeotia's oracle most fam'd,</L>
<L>Dismiss all fear. Thy country's guardian hail,</L>
<L>This mighty prince, Mardonius. He preserves</L>

<L>All range beneath his standards. To confer</L>
<L>With your Trophonius, lo! he comes with gifts,</L>

<L>His hours are precious, nor admit delay;</L>
<L N="130">Accept his sumptuous off'rings, and commence</L>
<L>The ceremonials due. At first aghast</L>
<L>The holy man survey'd the giant guard.</L>
<L>Soon admiration follow'd at thy form,</L>
<L>Mardonius. Low in stature, if compar'd</L>
<L N="135">With those unshapen savages, sublime</L>
<L>Thou trod'st in majesty of mien, and grace</L>
<L>Of just proportion. Last the gems and gold,</L>
<L><PB N="169" REF="177"/>
Bright vases, tripods, images and crowns,</L>
<L>The presents borne by those gigantic hands,</L>
<L N="140">With fascinating lustre fix'd the priest</L>
<L>To gaze unsated on the copious store.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Pass through, but unaccompany'd, he said,</L>
<L>Illustrious Persian. Be th' accepted gifts</L>
<L>Deposited within these holy gates.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="145">He leads the satrap to a grassy mount,</L>
<L>Distinct with scatter'd plantains. Each extends</L>
<L>O'er the smooth green his mantle brown of shade.</L>
<L>Of marble white an edifice rotund,</L>
<L>In all th' attractive elegance of art,</L>
<L N="150">Looks from the summit, and invites the feet</L>
<L>Of wond'ring strangers to ascend. The prince,</L>
<L>By his conductor, is instructed thus:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Observe yon dome. Thou first must enter there</L>
<L>Alone, there fervent in devotion bow</L>
<L N="155"><PB N="170" REF="178"/>
Before two statues; one of Genius good,</L>
<L>Of Fortune fair the other. At the word</L>
<L>Mardonius enters. Chance directs his eye</L>
<L>To that expressive form of Genius good,</L>
<L>Whose gracious lineaments, sedately sweet,</L>
<L N="160">Recall Masistius to the gloomy chief.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O melancholy! who can give thee praise?</L>
<L>Not sure the gentle; them thy weight o'erwhelms.</L>
<L>But thou art wholesome to intemp'rate minds,</L>
<L>In vain by wisdom caution'd. In the pool</L>
<L N="165">Of black adversity let them be steep'd,</L>
<L>Then pride, and lust, and fury thou dost tame.</L>
<L>So now Mardonius, by thy pow'r a enthrall'd,</L>
<L>Sighs in these words humility of grief.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If heav'n, relenting, will to me assign</L>
<L N="170">A Genius good, he bears no other name</L>
<L>Than of Masistius. Oh! thou spirit bless'd,</L>
<L><PB N="171" REF="179"/>
(For sure thy virtue dwells with endless peace)</L>
<L>Canst thou, her seat relinquishing awhile,</L>
<L>Unseen, or visible, protect thy friend</L>
<L N="175">In this momentous crisis of his fate;</L>
<L>Or wilt thou, if permitted? Ah! no more</L>
<L>Think of Mardonius fierce, ambitious, proud,</L>
<L>But as corrected by thy precepts mild;</L>
<L>Who would forego his warmest hopes of fame,</L>
<L N="180">Of pow'r and splendour, gladly to expire,</L>
<L>If so the myriads trusted to his charge</L>
<L>He might preserve, nor leave whole nations fall'n,</L>
<L>A prey to vultures on these hostile plains.</L>
<L>Come, and be witness to the tears which flow,</L>
<L N="185">Sure tokens of sincerity in me,</L>
<L>Not us'd to weep; who, humbled at thy loss,</L>
<L>Melt like a maiden, of her love bereav'd</L>

<L>Do thou descend, and Fortune will pursue</L>

A track unchang'd. Here turning, he adores</L>
<L>Her flatt'ring figure, and forsakes the dome.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Along Hercyna's bank they now proceed,</L>
<L>To where the river parts. One channel holds</L>
<L N="195">A sluggish, creeping water, under vaults</L>
<L>Of ebon shade, and soporific yew,</L>
<L>The growth of ages on the level line</L>
<L>Of either joyless verge. The satrap here,</L>
<L>Nam'd and presented by his former guide,</L>
<L N="200">A second priest receives, conductor new</L>
<L>Through night-resembling shadows, which obscure</L>
<L>The sleepy stream, unmoving to the sight,</L>
<L>Or moving mute. A fountain they approach,</L>
<L>One of Hercyna's sources. From the pores</L>
<L N="205">Of spongy rock an artificial vase</L>
<L>Of jetty marble in its round collects</L>
<L>The slow-distilling moisture. Hence the priest</L>
<L><PB N="173" REF="181"/>
A brimming chalice to Mardonius bears,</L>
<L>Whom in these words he solemnly accosts:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This fount is nam'd of Lethè. Who consults</L>
<L N="211">Our subterranean deity, must quaff</L>
<L>Oblivion here of all preceding thoughts,</L>

<L>If such oblivious sweets this cup contains,</L>
<L N="215">I gladly grasp it, cries the chief, and drinks.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ascending thence, a mazy walk they tread,</L>
<L>Where all the season's florid children shew</L>
<L>Their gorgeous rayment, and their odours breathe</L>
<L>Unspent; while musical in murmur flows</L>
<L N="220">Fast down a steep declivity of bed</L>
<L>Hercyna, winding in a channel new,</L>
<L>Apparent often to the glancing eye</L>
<L>Through apertures, which pierce the loaden boughs</L>
<L><PB N="174" REF="182"/>
Of golden fruit Hesperian, and th' attire</L>
<L N="225">Of myrtles green, o'ershadowing the banks.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In alabaster's variegated hues,</L>
<L>To bound the pleasing avenue, a fane</L>
<L>Its symmetry discover'd on a plat,</L>
<L>Thick-set with roses, which a circling skreen</L>
<L N="230">Of that fair ash, where cluster'd berries glow,</L>
<L>From ruffling gusts defended. Thither speeds</L>
<L>Mardonius, there deliver'd to a third</L>
<L>Religious minister supreme. Two youths,</L>
<L>In snow-like vesture, and of lib'ral mien,</L>
<L N="235">Sons of Lebadian citizens, attend,</L>
<L>Entit'led Mercuries. The seer address'd</L>
<L>The Persian warrior: In this mansion pure</L>
<L>Mnemosynè is worshipp'd; so in Greece</L>
<L>The pow'r of memory is styl'd. Advance,</L>
<L N="240">Invoke her aid propitious to retain</L>
<L>Whate'er by sounds, or visions, in his cave</L>
<L><PB N="175" REF="183"/>
The prophet god reveals. The chief comply'd;</L>
<L>The hallow'd image he approach'd, and spake:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thou art indeed a goddess, I revere.</L>
<L N="245">Now to Mardonius, if some dream or sign</L>
<L>Prognosticate success, and thou imprint</L>
<L>The admonitions of unerring heav'n</L>
<L>In his retentive mind; this arm, this sword</L>
<L>Shall win thy further favour to record</L>
<L N="250">His name and glory on the rolls of time.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This said, with lighter steps he quits the fane.</L>
<L>The Mercuries conduct him to a bath,</L>
<L>Fed from Hercyna's fairer, second source,</L>
<L>In shade sequester'd close. While there his limbs</L>
<L N="255">Are disarray'd of armour, to assume</L>
<L>A civil garment, soon as spotless streams</L>
<L>Have purify'd his frame; the priest, who stands</L>
<L>Without, in ecstacy of joy remarks</L>
<L><PB N="176" REF="184"/>
The rich Mardonian off'rings on their way,</L>
<L N="260">By servitors transported to enlarge</L>
<L>The holy treasure. Instant he prepares</L>
<L>For sacrifice. A sable ram is slain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fresh from ablution, lo! Mardonius comes</L>
<L>In linen vesture, fine and white, as down</L>
<L N="265">Of Paphian doves. A sash of tincture bright,</L>
<L>Which rivall'd Flora's brilliancy of dye,</L>
<L>Engirds his loins; majestical his brows</L>
<L>A wreath sustain; Lebadian sandals ease</L>
<L>His steps. Exchanging thus his martial guise,</L>
<L N="270">Like some immortal, of a gentler mold</L>
<L>Than Mars, he moves. So Phoebus, when he sets,</L>
<L>Lav'd by the nymphs of Tethys in their grot</L>
<L>Of coral after his diurnal toil,</L>
<L>Repairs his splendours, and his rosy track</L>
<L>Of morn resumes. With partial eyes the priest</L>
<L N="276">Explores the victim's entrails, and reports</L>
<L><PB N="177" REF="185"/>
Each sign auspicious with a willing tongue;</L>
<L>Then to Mardonius: Thee, Boeotia's friend,</L>
<L>Magnificently pious to her gods,</L>
<L N="280">Thee I pronounce a votary approv'd</L>
<L>By this Boeotian deity. Now seek</L>
<L>In confidence the cavern. But the rites</L>
<L>Demand, that first an image thou approach,</L>
<L>Which none, but those in purity of garb,</L>
<L N="285">None, but accepted suppliants of the god,</L>
<L>Can lawfully behold. Above the bath</L>
<L>A rock was hollow'd to an ample space;</L>
<L>Thence issued bubbling waters. See, he said,</L>
<L>The main Hercynian fount, whose face reflects</L>
<L N="290">Yon Daedalēan workmanship, the form</L>
<L>Trophonius bears. Adore that rev'rend beard,</L>
<L>The twisted serpents round that awful staff,</L>
<L>Those looks, which pierce the mysteries of fate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next through a winding cavity and vast</L>
<L N="295">He guides the prince along a mossy vault,</L>
<L><PB N="178" REF="186"/>
Rough with protuberant and tortuous roots</L>
<L>Of ancient woods, which, clothing all above,</L>
<L>In depth shoot downward equal to their height;</L>
<L>Suspended lamps, with livid glympse and faint,</L>
<L N="300">Direct their darkling passage. Now they reach</L>
<L>The further mouth unclosing in a dale</L>
<L>Abrupt; there shadow, never-fleeting, rests.</L>
<L>Rude-featur'd crags, o'erhanging, thence expel</L>
<L>The blaze of noon. Beneath a frowning clift</L>
<L N="305">A native arch, of altitude which tempts</L>
<L>The soaring eagle to construct his nest,</L>
<L>Expands before an excavation deep,</L>
<L>Unbowelling the hill. On either side</L>
<L>This gate of nature, hoary sons of time,</L>
<L N="310">Enlarg'd by ages to protentous growth,</L>
<L>Impenetrable yews augment the gloom.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In height two cubits, on the rocky floor</L>

In circular dimension; this upholds</L>

<L>A wicket opens to th' advancing prince;</L>
<L>Steps moveable th' attentive priest supplies;</L>
<L>By whom instructed, to the awful chasm</L>
<L N="320">Below, profound but narrow, where the god</L>
<L>His inspiration breathes, th' intrepid son</L>

<L>Up to the loins he plunges. Downward drawn,</L>

<L>He seems to stand; before him sleeps a pool,</L>
<L><PB N="180" REF="188"/>
Edg'd round by desert mountains, in their height</L>
<L>Obscuring heav'n. Without impulsive oars,</L>
<L N="335">Without a sail, spontaneous flies a bark</L>
<L>Above the stagnant surface, which, untouch'd,</L>
<L>Maintains its silence. On the margin rests</L>
<L>The skiff, presenting to the hero's view</L>
<L>An aged fire, of penetrating ken,</L>
<L N="340">His weight inclining on an ebon staff,</L>

<L>If, feed of Gobryas, thou wouldst know thy fate,</L>
<L>Embark with me; Trophonius I am call'd.</L>

<LG>
<L>Th' undaunted chief obeys. In flight more swift</L>

<L>Th' unmoving water's central spot they gain.</L>

As in a moment, their portentous way.</L>
<L>Around, above, the liquid mass retires,</L>
<L>In concave huge suspended, nor bedews</L>
<L>Their limbs, or garments. Two stupendous valves</L>
<L>Of adamant o'er half the bottom spread;</L>

<L>Self-lifted, they a spacious grot expose,</L>

<L>Here dwell the fatal Sisters; at their toil</L>

<L>The line dissever, and Mardonius, whirl'd</L>

Back from Trophonian gloom, is found supine</L>
<L N="370">Within the marble parapet, which fenc'd</L>
<L>The cavern's mouth. The watchful priest conducts</L>
<L>The agitated satrap, mute and sad,</L>
<L>Back to Mnemosynè's abode. His eyes</L>
<L>Are sternly fix'd. Now, prince, the seer began,</L>
<L N="375">Divulge, whatever thou hast heard and seen</L>
<L>Before this goddess. Priest, he said, suspend</L>
<L>Thy function now importunate. Remove.</L>

<L>The seer withdrawn, the Persian thus alone:</L>

<L>Farewell. Leonidas let Greece extol,</L>
<L>Me too shall Persia. Goddess, to thy charge</L>

<L N="385">Not as Leonidas compos'd, yet brave</L>

Amid the gloom of trouble, he prefers</L>
<L>Death to dishonour. O'er the holy ground</L>
<L>He pensive treads, a parallel to Saul,</L>
<L>Return'd from Endor's necromantic cell</L>
<L N="390">In sadness, still magnanimously firm</L>
<L>Ne'er to survive his dignity, but face</L>

<L N="395">Copaeae's lake repasses; and is lodg'd</L>

Thy passion. Gentle still a master's right</L>

<L N="371">Of some dark-vested cloud, a globe of fire</L>
<L>Through winds and rain precipitates a blaze</L>
<L>Terrific down the raven pall of night.</L>
<L>His whole division follows; with his band</L>

<L><PB N="277" REF="287"/>
From his first care. Successively they range.</L>
<L>The very fence, by Persian toil uprais'd,</L>
<L>Now from the Persian multitude secures</L>
<L>Th' Athenian near. No obstacle remains</L>
<L N="380">To Aristides, who compleats his plan.</L>
<L>Olympiodorus and his active train</L>
<L>With axes keen, and cleaving spades approach;</L>
<L>Hewn down, uptorn in that surmounted part,</L>
<L N="384">The fall'n defences, and the levell'd ground,</L>

<L>Eight thousand light, two thousand heavy-arm'd,</L>
<L>With Haliartus, and Oileus' son,</L>
<L>Cecropia's chief leads forward to sustain</L>
<L>His first bold warriors. Chileus enters next</L>
<L N="390">With his Tegaeans, Aemnestus brave,</L>
<L>Pausanias, Amompharetus, the youth</L>
<L>Of Menalippus, all the Spartan host.</L>
<L>Seven Grecian myriads through the breach invade</L>
<L>A ground, with swarms of tents and men oppress'd.</L>
<L N="395"><PB N="278" REF="288"/>
Dire thus th' irruption of Germanic seas</L>
<L>Through strong Batavian mounds; th' inflated brine</L>
<L>Stupendous piles of long-resisting weight</L>
<L>Bears down, and, baffling strength and art combin'd,</L>
<L>Foams o'er a country in its seat profound</L>
<L N="400">Below the surface of th' endang'ring main;</L>
<L>A country, where frugality and toil</L>
<L>No spot leave waste, no meadow, but in herds</L>
<L>Redundant; where the num'rous dwellings shew</L>
<L>Simplicity but plenty, now immers'd</L>
<L N="405">With all their throng'd inhabitants beneath</L>
<L>Th' unsparing deluge. Aristides swift,</L>
<L>As if by gen'ral choice the chief supreme,</L>
<L>Commandment issues, that to either side</L>
<L>The host extend, that, skirted by the fence,</L>
<L N="410">With wheeling flanks in front the line assume</L>
<L>A crescent's figure. Thus the fisher skill'd</L>
<L>With his capacious seines, slow-dragg'd and press'd</L>
<L><PB N="279" REF="289"/>
Close on each bank, a river's whole expanse</L>
<L>With all his natives glossy-finn'd involves.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="415">Yet Mindarus, with Mede and Persian ranks,</L>
<L>A large remainder from the morning fight,</L>
<L>Resists, which soon are slaughter'd; he retreats</L>
<L>Among the tents, whose multitude impedes</L>
<L>The Grecians. Aristides straight commands,</L>
<L N="420">That from the heavy line's disjointed length</L>
<L>A hundred bands expatiate in the chace</L>
<L>Of foes benumb'd by fear, who neither fight,</L>
<L>Nor fly, of means depriv'd. The carnage grows</L>
<L>In every quarter. Fountains seem unclos'd,</L>
<L N="425">Whence rivulets of blood o'erflow the ground.</L>
<L>O'er satraps, potentates, and princes fall'n,</L>
<L>Strode Aristides first of men, of heav'n</L>
<L>The imitator in his civil deeds,</L>
<L>Now some faint semblance, far as mortal may</L>
<L N="430">Of that Almighty victor on the field</L>
<L><PB N="280" REF="290"/>
Ethereal, when o'er helms, and helmed heads</L>
<L>Of prostrate seraphim, and powers o'erthrown,</L>
<L>He rode. Still Mindarus, by courage wing'd,</L>
<L>From nation flies to nation, still persists</L>
<L N="435">Exhorting; though in hopeless thought he sees</L>
<L>Great Hyperanthes from the shades ascend,</L>
<L>And seems to hear the godlike phantom sigh</L>
<L>In mournful words like these: Ah! fruitless toil!</L>
<L>As once was mine, to rescue from despair</L>
<L N="440">The panic fears of Asia! Dead in mind,</L>
<L>Her host already soon dead clay must lie,</L>
<L>Like me on Oeta's rock. Yet Midias brave,</L>
<L>With Tiridates rous'd, their efforts join.</L>
<L>Against them warlike Medon, and the seed</L>
<L>Of Lygdamis, chance brings. They side by side,</L>
<L N="446">As heretofore Thermopylae beheld</L>
<L>Young Dithyrambus and Diomedon,</L>
<L>Had all the day their unresisted wedge</L>
<L>Of Locrian shields and Delphian led to deeds,</L>
<L N="450"><PB N="281" REF="291"/>
Accumulating trophies. Midias falls</L>
<L>By Haliartus. From the slain his lance</L>
<L>Recov'ring, tow'rds his patron dear he turns;</L>
<L>Him conqu'ror too of Tiridates views</L>
<L>In joy; joy soon to sorrow chang'd! Fate guides</L>
<L N="455">A casual weapon from a distant hand;</L>
<L>Such as at Ramoth from the Syrian bow,</L>
<L>Drawn at a venture, smote between the joints</L>
<L>Of harness strong the Israelitish king,</L>
<L>Who from the fight bade wheel his chariot, stain'd</L>
<L N="460">With his own crimson. Ponderous and broad</L>
<L>The hostile lance inflicts a mortal wound</L>
<L>In Medon's gen'rous bosom. Not a sigh</L>
<L>He breathes, in look still placid and sedate,</L>
<L>While death's cold moisture stagnates on his limbs,</L>
<L N="465">By all their pow'rs forsaken. Bear, he said</L>
<L>To Haliartus, bear me from the camp,</L>
<L>Nor yet extract the weapon; life, I feel,</L>
<L>Would follow swift, and Medon hath a charge</L>
<L><PB N="282" REF="292"/>
Yet to deliver. Some pathetic Muse,</L>
<L N="470">In tend'rest measures give these numbers flow!</L>
<L>Let thine, who plaintive on the pontic verge</L>
<L>In servitude Sarmatian, through her page</L>
<L>Of sorrows weeps thy banishment from Rome;</L>
<L>Or thine, Euripides, whose moral strains</L>
<L N="475">Melt sympathy in tears at human woes,</L>
<L>Thy vary'd tragic themes, or both unite</L>
<L>Your inspiration to describe a heart,</L>
<L>Where gratitude o'er all affections dear</L>
<L>Predominantly sway'd; the faithful heart</L>
<L N="480">Of Haliartus at this sudden stroke</L>
<L>Of direful chance. To death is Medon snatch'd,</L>
<L>From glory snatch'd amid victorious friends.</L>
<L>The Carian's bosom instant feels combin'd</L>
<L>Achilles' anguish at Patroclus dead,</L>
<L N="485">The pang of Priam at the fall of Troy,</L>
<L>Ev'n woman's grief, Andromache's distress</L>
<L>For her slain Hector, and his mother's pain</L>
<L><PB N="283" REF="293"/>
To see his mangled and dishonour'd corse.</L>
<L>Great Artemisia's name, th' illustrious blood</L>
<L N="490">From Lygdamis deriv'd, his own exploits</L>
<L>Of recent fame, are all eras'd from thought</L>
<L>In Haliartus now; who sinks again</L>
<L>To Meliboeus. On the wounded chief,</L>
<L>As on his lord, his patron, still he looks</L>
<L N="495">With all th' affection of a menial, bred</L>
<L>In the same home, and cherish'd in that home</L>
<L>With lib'ral kindness to his humbler state.</L>
<L>He clasps the fainting hero, on the shields</L>
<L>Of weeping friends deposits, and conveys</L>
<L N="500">Swift through a portal, from its hinges forc'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Three hours remain'd to Phoebus in his course.</L>
<L>Close by the entrenchment, under beachen shade</L>
<L>Of ancient growth, a fountain bursts in rills</L>
<L>Transparent; thither on the down of moss</L>
<L N="505">Was Medon borne and laid. Unloose, he said,</L>
<L><PB N="284" REF="294"/>
My helm, and fill from that refreshing stream.</L>
<L>Obey'd, he drank a part; then pouring down</L>
<L>The remnant, spake: By this libation clear</L>
<L>Be testified my thanks to all the gods,</L>
<L N="510">That I have liv'd to see my country sav'd</L>
<L>On this victorious day. My fate requires</L>
<L>No lamentation, Haliartus dear,</L>
<L>Oh! more, than kindred, dear. Commend me first</L>
<L>To Aristides; Medon's parting breath</L>
<L N="515">Him victor hails. To Delphi's virtuous priest,</L>
<L>To my Leonteus, to the glorious son</L>
<L>Of Neocles, my salutation bear,</L>
<L>To kind Cleander, my Troezenian host,</L>
<L>To Hyacinthus of Euboea's race,</L>
<L>The flower of all her chieftains: They have prov'd</L>
<L N="521">In me some zeal their island to redeem.</L>
<L>Transport my ashes to Melissa's care,</L>
<L>Them near the reliques of Laconia's king</L>
<L>Repose; be mine the neighbour of his urn.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="285" REF="295"/>
<L N="525">Here with an utmost effort of his voice,</L>
<L>With arms extended, and Elysian look:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Leonidas, the life thy friendship sav'd,</L>
<L>An off'ring to thy manes, now I close</L>
<L>Mature in age, to glory not unknown,</L>
<L N="530">Above the wish, as destitute of hope</L>
<L>To find a fairer time, or better cause,</L>
<L>Than sends me now a messenger to greet</L>
<L>Thee with glad tidings of this land preserv'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With his own hand the javelin from his breast</L>
<L>He draws serene; life issues through the wound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>New shouts, new trumpets, waken from a trance</L>
<L>Of grief the son of Lygdamis. He sees</L>
<L>Cleander; who th' Asopian banks had pass'd,</L>
<L>Call'd by Sicinus from Saturnia's dome.</L>
<L N="540">Lo! Epidaurian Clitophon, the ranks</L>
<L><PB N="286" REF="296"/>
Of Phlius with Menander, Sicyon's chief</L>
<L>Automedon, the Hermionean spears</L>
<L>With Lycus follow, Cephallene's sons,</L>
<L>The Acarnanian, all th' Epirot bands,</L>
<L N="545">Leprēan Conon, with Mycenae's youth</L>
<L>Polydamas, by Arimnestus led</L>
<L>The brave Plataeans, with his Thespian files</L>
<L>Alcimedon, Nearcus with his force</L>
<L>Of Chalcis, Potidaean Tydeus next,</L>
<L N="550">Eretrian Cleon, Lampon, and the troop</L>
<L>Of little Styra, Corinth's banners last,</L>
<L>By Adimantus and Alcmaeon rang'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Too late you come for glory, them bespake</L>
<L>The Carian sad: Lo! half the foes destroy'd</L>
<L N="555">By Aristides, fugitives the rest;</L>
<L>Lo! there the only loss, which Greece sustains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To him Cleander, with devout regret</L>
<L>O'er Medon, honour'd paranymph and guest,</L>
<L><PB N="287" REF="297"/>
His head inclining: Not too late we come</L>
<L N="560">For sacrifice of Persians to the ghost</L>
<L>Of this dead hero. Ah! what floods of tears</L>
<L>Will fall in Troezen—But let grief prevail</L>
<L>Hereafter. Son of Lygdamis, renounce</L>
<L>Despondency; Acanthè still survives</L>
<L N="565">To fire thy breast as Ariphilia mine;</L>
<L>I hear her prompting my vindictive arm.</L>
<L>From thy experience of this glorious day</L>
<L>Lead thy Troezenian host, where best to point</L>
<L>His strenuous efforts. Let thy guiding zeal</L>
<L N="570">For me, long cursing my inactive post,</L>
<L>Yet find one track to fame. These gallant words</L>
<L>Of cordial frankness from dejection lift</L>
<L>The Carian brave, not less than Phoebus cheer'd</L>
<L>The languid son of Priam on the bank</L>
<L N="575">Of Xanthus; when a stony mass, of weight</L>
<L>To stay a keel on Hellespontine sands,</L>
<L>By Ajax hurl'd, benumb'd the Trojan's frame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="288" REF="298"/>
<L>Thus Haliartus: Through that open gate,</L>
<L>New forc'd, the shortest, safest passage lies;</L>
<L N="580">But, to acquire some lustre, I can shew</L>
<L>Another track for prowess yet to shine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He leads, all follow, save Corinthian bands</L>
<L>With Adimantus, hast'ning through the gate,</L>
<L>Soon as to him th' intelligence is brought;</L>
<L N="585">Who ent'ring, sees a carnage which confounds</L>
<L>A timid spirit. By Alcmaeon urg'd,</L>
<L>Close by the fence he marches; none he meets</L>
<L>But fly before him. Adimantus lifts</L>
<L>His spear, and satiates cowardice with blood</L>
<L N="590">Of unresisting men. By cheap success</L>
<L>Betray'd, a distant quarter he attains,</L>
<L>Where Mindarus confronts him. From his steed</L>
<L>Th' unyielding satrap whirls a rapid lance,</L>
<L>Which nails the base Corinthian to the ground.</L>
<L N="595">Alcmaeon next is wounded; more had bled,</L>
<L><PB N="289" REF="299"/>
But Aristides o'er that part, devoid</L>
<L>Of tents, his dreadful crescent in array</L>
<L>Is forming new. The Persian starts; he flies</L>
<L>To one last angle of the spacious camp,</L>
<L N="600">Sole spot unforc'd. Half circled now in front,</L>
<L>The Attic, Spartan, and Tegaean ranks,</L>
<L>In motion slow, yet moving on, augment</L>
<L>Progressively their terrors, like a range</L>
<L>Of clouds, which thicken on the brow of night,</L>
<L N="605">A final wreck portending to a fleet,</L>
<L>Already shatter'd by the morning storm.</L>
<L>Round Mindarus the remnant of his host</L>
<L>Collected still is numerous. Them he sees</L>
<L>Oft look behind, a sight that ill accords</L>
<L N="610">With warriors; but, as now in columns deep</L>
<L>Its glitt'ring horns that direful crescent shews</L>
<L>Within the limits of a javelin's cast,</L>
<L>All turn intent on flight at large; they break</L>
<L><PB N="290" REF="300"/>
Their own inclosure down, whose late defence</L>
<L N="615">Is present bane, and intercepts escape.</L>
<L>Lo! Haliartus; all whose grief is chang'd</L>
<L>To fire, heroic flame. Three myriads fresh</L>
<L>He pours; that crouded angle he invests,</L>
<L>Preventing flight. Cleander looks around</L>
<L N="620">Like some tornado menacing a bark,</L>
<L>Which soon unseam'd and parted sinks ingulph'd;</L>
<L>He finds a breach and with him enters death.</L>
<L>The long-enduring satrap, whose mild soul</L>
<L>Calamity hath worn, resembles now</L>
<L N="625">The poor desponding sailor, who is left</L>
<L>Last of the found'ring vessel on a plank</L>
<L>Alone. No coast appears; the greedy swell</L>
<L>He sees around, expecting ev'ry wave</L>
<L>Will terminate his being, and forgoes</L>
<L N="630">All hope of succour. His afflicted soul</L>
<L>Thus with an effort equal to his rank</L>
<L><PB N="291" REF="301"/>
The prince explores: What, Mindarus, remains</L>
<L>For thee deserted! In another's home</L>
<L>Cleora dwells, Masistius is no more;</L>
<L N="635">Slain is Mardonius, Asia's glory fall'n;</L>
<L>Thou hast too long been fugitive this day;</L>
<L>Like Teribazus close a term of woe;</L>
<L>Like him in death be honour'd. He dismounts,</L>
<L>He grasps a spear. Such dignity of shame</L>
<L N="640">To Ilian Hector, from his flight recall'd,</L>
<L>Great Homer's Muse imparted. While the prince</L>
<L>Is meditating thus, a man sublime</L>
<L>Tow'rs from th' Athenians, who suspend their march;</L>
<L>Unlike the son of Peleus in his ire</L>
<L N="645">Implacable, he represents a god</L>
<L>In aspect, god of mercy, not of arms.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Know, chieftain, he began, to me the Greeks</L>
<L>One Persian life have granted; it is thine.</L>
<L><PB N="292" REF="302"/>
In this day's trial I have noted well</L>
<L N="650">Thy constancy and manhood; I, who prize</L>
<L>The gems of virtue, in whatever clime,</L>
<L>O Persian! whether in a friend or foe</L>
<L>Their never-changing lustre they display;</L>
<L>I, Aristides, my protecting arm</L>
<L>Extend. Time presses; yield thee, ere too late;</L>
<L N="656">Captivity no burden shalt thou find,</L>
<L>Till safe, without a ransom, thou regain</L>
<L>Thy native seat. The Persian melts like snow</L>
<L>In all its rigour at the noon-tide sun.</L>
<L N="660">This unforeseen, humane demeanour calms</L>
<L>His mind, and hushes ev'ry desp'rate thought.</L>
<L>He thus replies: On all my actions past</L>
<L>Hath fortune frown'd; perhaps a captive state</L>
<L>With Aristides, whom Masistius lov'd,</L>
<L N="665">Mardonius prais'd, and all mankind reveres,</L>
<L>Forebodes a change of fortune to my gain!</L>
<L><PB N="293" REF="303"/>
Thy condescending wisdom, O supreme</L>
<L>In justice, knowledge, and benignant deeds,</L>
<L>May lift a man of sorrows from despair!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="670">He yields. Th' Athenian leads him through the press</L>
<L>Secure; himself a spectacle avoids,</L>
<L>Which others covet. Lo! on ev'ry side</L>
<L>Keen swords of massacre are wav'd. To maids</L>
<L>Deflow'r'd, dishonour'd wives, and gods prophan'd,</L>
<L N="675">To Athens, Thespia, and Plataea burnt,</L>
<L>The Greeks compleat their sacrifice. The sun,</L>
<L>Wont on those fields of glist'ning green to smile,</L>
<L>And trace Asopus through his crystal maze,</L>
<L>Now setting, glances over lakes of blood;</L>
<L>While fate with Persian carnage chafes the stream</L>
<L N="681">No longer smooth and limpid, but o'erswoln,</L>
<L>And foaming purple, with encreasing heaps</L>
<L><PB N="294" REF="304"/>
Of carcases and arms. Night drops her shade</L>
<L>On thirty myriads slaughter'd. Thus thy death,</L>
<L N="685">Leonidas of Sparta, was aveng'd,</L>
<L>Greece thus by Attic virtue was preserv'd.</L>
