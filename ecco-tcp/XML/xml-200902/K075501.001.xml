<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE the first publication of this work, the author has annually enlarged and improved it. It must occur to every one, that time only, and conti∣nual reading, can add to the collection; which makes every new edition more valuable than the last. It has been the author's study to examine into the accuracy of dates, and reconcile the difference of historians, who vary in nothing more than in the times when events happened, owing to different com∣mencements of the year with different people. The Jews began the year with the month of March; the Athenians, with June; the Macedonians, with the 24th of September; the Christians of Egypt and Ethiopia, with the 29th or 30th of August; the Persians and Armenians, with the 11th of the same month; but most christians of the Western world reckon from the 1st of January. Indeed, from the Roman Conquest to Bede, time seems to have been computed from Christmas day. The Saxon chronicle begins the year from the birth of our Lord. At the beginning of the 13th century, some computed from the Annunciation, some from the Nativity, some from the Circumcision, and others from the Passion of our Lord; of course, there was no fixed rule of computation in Gervase of Canterbury's time. Matt. Paris, Matt. Westminster, Ralph de Diceto, and Polydore Virgil, place the Coronation of William I. on Christmas day, 1067. Hence it appears, that they began the year on that day. Walsingham and Brompton refer it to Christmas day, 1066, which proves, that they did not begin the year till <HI>after</HI> that day. At the Reformation, the year was ap∣pointed to begin on the 25th of March; but others say, in 1265; that being supposed by some, to have
<PB N="vi" REF="4"/>been the day when the world was created, and when Christ was conceived: it thus continued till 1752, when it was brought back to the 1st of January. The Scots, from time immemorial, observed the 25th of March as the first day of the year, till Nov. 27, 1599; when the 1st of January was or∣dered, by proclamation, to be the beginning of the year there.</P>
<P>From these variations in the computation of time, respecting the commencement of the year, &amp;c. we may account for the difference of dates in the several historians. It has been the study, therefore, of the Author of this work, as far as possible, to reconcile them; and he has happily succeeded in a thousand instances, and in all he is as correct, as a work of this kind (which consists chiefly of figures) is capable of; he flatters himself, therefore, it will be found superior to other books of chronology, where no such attention has been paid. He has industriously thrown out, also, all unimportant matter, and given the Reader only such occurrences as he must wish to be acquainted with.</P>
<P>This work being found highly proper to be put into the hands of youth, chronology being one of the chief branches of the <HI>belles lettres;</HI> to adapt it for the purpose, this edition is published; wherein the author has given a more enlarged view of English history, and flatters himself he has thus rendered it a complete school-book. It is already received at Westminster, Eaton, Winchester, Marybone, &amp;c. &amp;c. and all other great schools, as well for boys as for girls.</P>
<P>☞ A small edition of this work, so contrived as not to exceed the size of a pocket almanack, may be had of all the booksellers, price 1s. 6d.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE events of different reigns, as they arose, may be found, by turning to the respective kings one after another.</P>
<P>With respect to dates, no notice is taken of the Old Stile, but they are regulated according to the New; thus January 1741/2, is called January, 1742.</P>
<P>As to ages, this rule is observed; if a person at his death had entered only in his 40th year, he is recorded to have died, aged 39.</P>
<P>Names to which St. is prefixed, if not found by the first letter of the name, may under the word Saint.</P>
<P>The times in which such writers lived, as were bishops, if not found in alphabetical order, may be seen by turning to the list of bishops.</P>
<P>Where no distinction of country is made to the peerages, that of England is implied.</P>
<P>Where references are made to <HI>Rem. Occur.</HI> it means to those remarkable occurrences at the beginning of the Second Volume, which could not be so well thrown into alphabetical order.</P>
<P>This volume serves as a complete Index to all the Histories of England extant, by referring to the years in which occurrences happened. The years are ge∣nerally marked in the margins of the various his∣tories.</P>
<P>Several historical facts will be found, by referring to particular names in Vol. II.</P>
<P>The author will be very thankful for any cor∣rections, additions, or improvements left with his publisher, R. BALDWIN.</P>
