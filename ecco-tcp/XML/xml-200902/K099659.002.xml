<HEAD>THORNEY, LABEN, AND DOLEIN, A PASTORAL.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<STAGE><HI>Dolein,</HI> complaining of his melancholy state, as he sits beneath a bending willow, that shades a brook, is observed by <HI>Thorney</HI> and <HI>Laben,</HI> who hear him bewailing his misfortunes to the stream; they interrupt him, lest his passion should drive him to desperation, and to death.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>THORNEY.</SPEAKER>
<L>STAY, Laben stay, see'st thou not yonder swain?</L>
<L>Methinks I hear him too, in grief complain,</L>
<L>Stranger he is to me, but yet I'll know</L>
<L>The cause, from whence those strains of anguish flow;</L>
<L>He oft has pass'd my cot by break of day,</L>
<L>And as he mov'd, some doleful strain he'd play.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
<SPEAKER>LABEN.</SPEAKER>
<L>Well does he tune his pipe, for yester-morn</L>
<L>I saw him roam on yonder brow forlorn,</L>
<L>Anon he sat him down beneath a tree,</L>
<L>And play'd such sweet and plaintive melody,</L>
<L>The groves were hush'd, the linnets on the plains,</L>
<L>Forgot their own, and listen'd to his strains.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>THORNEY.</SPEAKER>
<L>Fair too he seems, and comely in his form,</L>
<L>What pity 'tis, that sorrow should bestorm</L>
<L>A breast so mild, and rob his seemly face,</L>
<L>Of every smile, and every youthful grace.—</L>
<L>Alas, alas, what new afflictions rise!</L>
<L>Fast stream again his sad uplifted eyes.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LABEN.</SPEAKER>
<L>As the pale snow-drop, on its chilly bed</L>
<L>Bending to earth its melancholy head,</L>
<L>So freezing care inclines him to the earth,</L>
<L>Ere time has brought maturity to birth,</L>
<L>See how he heaves, and with desponding look,</L>
<L>Turns his sad eyes upon the heedless brook.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
<SPEAKER>THORNEY.</SPEAKER>
<L>Alas, alas, his dread intent I fear,</L>
<L>Too plain, too plain the symptoms now appear;</L>
<L>O let us fly, and ere it be too late,</L>
<L>Heal his poor bosom, and prevent his fate,</L>
<L>Stop, if we can, the rapid floods of grief,</L>
<L>And if he'll take, we'll give his wants relief.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOLEIN.</SPEAKER>
<L>Ah me! methought, some friendly accents near,</L>
<L>With earnest voice, came whisp'ring to my ear:</L>
<L>'Twas fancy spoke, that gave my wish a tongue,</L>
<L>But hope too long has on my patience hung;</L>
<L>No man shall see my tears, none hear me groan,</L>
<L>No tongue shall tell my tale, I'll die alone.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>THORNEY.</SPEAKER>
<L>Live, shepherd live, and be thy woes forgot,</L>
<L>Fate has in store for thee a better lot,</L>
<L>For lo, this swain and I are come to save,</L>
<L>And step between thy sorrows and the grave;</L>
<L>Tell us thy tale, that we may share thy grief,</L>
<L>And give thy laden bosom some relief.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
<SPEAKER>LABEN.</SPEAKER>
<L>Look not amazed, thou solitary swain,</L>
<L>Shew us the cause, the fountain of thy pain,</L>
<L>That we as swift as stock-doves on the wing,</L>
<L>May stop at once the fountain and the spring:</L>
<L>My cot's hard by, there go and seek repose,</L>
<L>Till thou shalt please thy story to disclose.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOLEIN.</SPEAKER>
<L>Ye gentle-hearted swains that sympathize,</L>
<L>And view my wretched plight with flooded eyes,</L>
<L>Ah, would it aught to me or you avail,</L>
<L>I'd tell you o'er and o'er my woeful tale:</L>
<L>Too sad, are now my sorrows, to relate,</L>
<L>Too long the story, and too sure my fate,</L>
<L>For death alone must my physician prove,</L>
<L>I've lost my herds, my lambkins, and my love.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>THORNEY.</SPEAKER>
<L>Cease, cease thou sad, thou melancholy swain,</L>
<L>To figh, to weep, to wander and complain;</L>
<L>Nor yet despair, because forlorn and poor,</L>
<L>We've got to spare, and thou shalt share our store,</L>
<L>If death hath robb'd thee of thy constant love,</L>
<L>Some other maid may yet as constant prove.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
<SPEAKER>DOLEIN.</SPEAKER>
<L>It cannot be, my firm resolve is made,</L>
<L>My heart is with her in the billows laid,</L>
<L>The cruel floods have wash'd her from my side,</L>
<L>I saw her floating on the dreadful tide,</L>
<L>This frame no more shall keep my soul a slave,</L>
<L>Like her I'll die, within a watry grave.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LABEN.</SPEAKER>
<L>Rash swain, forbear, thy stars may yet be kind,</L>
<L>The waves may pity, and the sighing wind</L>
<L>May waft her yet surviving on the shore;</L>
<L>Hope, and the fates, may yet thy love restore;</L>
<L>Then look more chearful, thou desponding swain,</L>
<L>Thou yet may meet her on the usual plain.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOLEIN.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thou best of friends, thou'st reason'd me to life,</L>
<L>Thou'st set my greatest doubts with hope at strife;</L>
<L>I will suspend awhile my rash design,</L>
<L>The winds and waves may yet my love resign,</L>
<L>May yet in pity to my mad'ning pain,</L>
<L>Let me behold Phidele's eyes again.</L>

<STAGE><HI>Dolein</HI> sees <HI>Phidele</HI> laying on a sunny bank, as yet but half recovered from the fright and fury of the flood, he is transported into inexpressible extacy, and joy; he is going too precipitately to throw himself before her, but is persuaded by <HI>Thorney</HI> and <HI>Laben</HI> to desist awhile, for fear the sudden joy might over∣come her; they first apprize her of her <HI>Dolein</HI>'s being safe and well, then soon afterwards, intro∣duce him.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOLEIN.</SPEAKER>
<L>DEceive me not, my sad, my wishful eyes,</L>
<L>It is Phidele sure, that yonder lies:</L>
<L>She breathes! she breathes!—ye blessed Fates how kind!</L>
<L>Thanks to my stars, the waters and the wind!</L>
<L>O let me fly, the lovely maid to chear,</L>
<L>And whisper joy and comfort in her ear.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>THORNEY.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yet hold fond swain, nor let excess of joy,</L>
<L>Nor greedy love, thy living hopes destroy.</L>
<L>Life faintly seems to glimmer in her eyes,</L>
<L>And soon may be extinguished with surprize,</L>
<L>Let this kind swain and I, with tender care,</L>
<L>First shew the coming pleasure, to the fair.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOLEIN.</SPEAKER>
<L>O fly then, dearest friends, ere't be too late,</L>
<L>Evade, evade, the threat'ning hand of fate,</L>
<L>From your sweet counsel 'tis, that I survive,</L>
<L>And see my dear Phidele yet alive;</L>
<L>On your sweet counsel, Dolein still depends,</L>
<L>Blest be the stars, that sent him two such friends.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LABEN.</SPEAKER>
<L>Like mild physicians, we'll address the maid,</L>
<L>Who sooth the dying, when in anguish laid,</L>
<L>To calm the tides of sorrow and despair,</L>
<L>We'll talk of thee, and chear the drooping fair;</L>
<L>Then when her breast is temper'd for the scene,</L>
<L>We'll say her shepherd comes across the green.</L>
</SP>

<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>DOLEIN.</SPEAKER>
<L>Succeed; and heaven be your next reward,</L>
<L>May angels all your friendly deeds record,</L>
<L>May months of joy, and years of love repay</L>
<L>The faith and friendship, you have shewn to-day.</L>
<L>My grateful heart, my ebbing eyes o'erflows,</L>
<L>Say, how shall Dolein pay the debt he owes?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>THORNEY.</SPEAKER>
<L>Behold the fair one press her swelling breast,</L>
<L>As if by phrenzy or by love distress'd;</L>
<L>I'll on and wipe away each scalding tear,</L>
<L>And tell the maiden, that her lover's near:</L>
<L>Look chearful, shepherd, and thou soon shalt see,</L>
<L>We'll crown thy hours with felicity.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LABEN.</SPEAKER>
<L>Sweet maid, give ear, I come with no pretence</L>
<L>To gain thy love, or give thy heart offence,</L>
<L>Thy sorrows and thy story well I know,</L>
<L>I come, my mite of friendship to bestow;</L>
<L>To chear thy soul, to heal each doubt and pain,</L>
<L>To tell thee of thy living, weeping swain.</L>

<L>Blest be thy tongue, thou hospitable swain,</L>
<L>No bird e'er warbled in so sweet a strain.</L>
<L>Does Dolein live? my heart is heal'd with joy,</L>
<L>Shall I again behold my plaintive boy?</L>
<L>Alas, I thought him in the billows laid,</L>
<L>And wish'd to die beneath some gloomy shade.</L>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>THORNEY.</SPEAKER>
<L>Behold he comes impatient o'er the plain,</L>
<L>To meet his fair Phidele once again.</L>
<L>Smile, lovely maid, and throw thy fears away,</L>
<L>Thou yet shalt hear him on the mountain play,</L>
<L>Again your flocks shall feed in yonder vale,</L>
<L>Again, by moon-light, hear the nightingale.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOLEIN.</SPEAKER>
<L>My lov'd Phidele has the waves controul'd!</L>
<L>Ye blessed Fates, and do I yet enfold</L>
<L>My dear Phidele in my welcome arms;</L>
<L>The floods were sure asswaged by thy charms,</L>
<L>The winds were sure subdu'd by thy sweet eyes,</L>
<L>And yielded Dolein back his darling prize.</L>

<SPEAKER>PHIDELE.</SPEAKER>
<L>At Dolein's voice the threat'ning winds were hush'd,</L>
<L>Thro' dark'ning clouds the conscious Phoebus blush'd,</L>
<L>The waves that shook the willows with their roar,</L>
<L>In pity wash'd me to the welcome shore;</L>
<L>In pity sure, my shepherd, 'twas to you,</L>
<L>For sure no shepherd yet was half so true.</L>

<P>Yes, truly, Sir, for she has been out for this month past, at four and five o'clock in the morning; I could not think where she went to, till the other day, when going o'er the green pastures; there I saw Celon and her, billing and cooing like too young pidgeons.</P>

<P>Indeed? odds my life, I remember now;—ah, she's a coaxing young pug; that's where she gets her posies from I suppose, which

<P>Hold your tongue, pray madam, and let him speak; he sees her follies, tho' you can't, and 'tis honest in him to tell me of them.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Brain.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry my dear, to see you so angry,—don't think that I approve of her pro∣ceedings; no, far be it from me; but I can't help taking notice how ready the fellow is to tell you of her faults; for he sees they work upon you to excess, and you are as eager to hear what gives you so much pain; if he had gene∣rously told me of it before, I wou'd have put a stop to it ere now, and you might have escap'd all this uneasiness; for if our children are to
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
bear the censure of our servants, what child will escape slander? I don't doubt what he has said to be true, but while he sees it feeds your anger, and he finds himself listen'd to, he may turn surmises into facts, and she may be stig∣matiz'd where e'er she goes, as being guilty of what she never dreamt of.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Brain.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, it does not signify hold∣ing this harrangue about her,—I'm determin'd to have her kept at home, and then I'm sure she'll be safe, let the world then say what it pleases;—go fetch her hither Trusty.</P>

<P>Marry I doubt it much, e'en then; and whether the creature (that has taken so much pains to tell you her faults) would not be the first in the world that would strive to make her guilty of another; for I know he's very sweet upon her when our backs are turn'd.</P>

<L>Wou'd man but own his duty, and be blest:</L>
<L>As when the harp, in Jesse's golden days,</L>
<L>Tun'd ev'ry sabbath to Jehovah's praise,</L>
<L>By holy prophets, and by virgins strung,</L>
<L>When truth and faith inspir'd ev'ry tongue;</L>
<L>Or when his son with eloquence divine,</L>
<L>(The greatest favourite of the sacred <HI>Nine</HI>)</L>
<L>Made the proud Saul, whene'er he touch'd his strings,</L>
<L>Bow his stiff neck, and own the King of Kings.</L>
</LG>

<L>Observe the present age,—how vain, how strange!</L>
<L>How true sang he, who told us, "all things change."</L>
<L>A puny race of infidels and fools,</L>
<L>True slaves to vice, and fashion's gaudy tools;</L>
<L>Strangers to virtue, enemies to fame,</L>

<L>My Lord sends forth his hopeful heir to roam</L>

<L>A flimsy fop, a coxcomb and a fool,—</L>
<L>A greater dunce, than when he left the school:</L>
<L>Quick at intrigue, to gamble, or to fight,</L>
<L>A debauchee, if not a s—te.</L>

<L>But to my theme; my muse at random strays,</L>
<L>And with a tedious prelude, she delays</L>

<L>I'll paint the scenes from nature, if I can;</L>
<L>We raise subscriptions and new churches build,</L>

<L>An honest 'squire held the hall,</L>

<L>A neighbourhood so well inclin'd,</L>
<L>So simple, honest, and so kind,</L>

<L>As soon as morning dawn appear'd,</L>

The thrifty villagers arose,</L>

<L>The 'Squire, charm'd at such a deed,</L>

<L>Before your gracious summons we pursue,</L>
<L>I'll tell you something odd, and something new;</L>
<L>Last night, when half the world was fast asleep,</L>
<L>I chanc'd into a sot-house club to creep,</L>
<L>Where taylors, weavers, butchers, bakers, sate,</L>
<L>Disputing high of politics and state;</L>
<L>Here sat a Methodist, a man of blood,</L>
<L>Who thought no precepts but his own were good.</L>
<L>There a poor taylor, one of vast persuasion,</L>
<L>A politician, fond of innovation,</L>
<L>A very coward, yet he swore he'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight,</L>
<L>Before he'd lose one privilege or right.</L>
<L>He look'd all fierceness, and he talk'd most brave,</L>
<L>And yet he prov'd himself a fool and slave.</L>
<L>From morn to night, he sat a muddl'd sot,</L>
<L>Bound like a vassal, to his score and pot.</L>
<L>His heart oft gave his fruitless tongue the lie,</L>
<L>For he lov'd liquor, more than liberty.</L>
<L>Anon, a vehement debate arose,</L>
<L>And then I whipp'd across his burning nose;</L>
<L>Sometimes I'd tickle him. I love to teaze,</L>
<L>And then, to clear his head, wou'd make him sneeze,</L>

When next, our SHAKESPEARE on the carpet came,</L>

<L>Mankind were too profuse, but hell shou'd stint 'em,</L>

<STAGE>GRAND MARCH IS PLAYED.</STAGE>
<STAGE>NIGHT ascends with a starry mantle, drawn by dragons through the air. Aurora with a taper, representing twilight; with garlands of flowers, which blossom in her hands. As she walks gently down the stage, birds are heard to sing, and soft music, as in the air; the rays of the Sun appear in the greatest glory, and the clouds seem all fretted with gold; the light in∣creases, and discovers a magnificent and extensive temple, with Cherubims playing, sitting on fes∣toons and wreaths of flowers, which are twined about most beautiful columns of sapphire and gold. Apollo rises as the Sun. Flora, with a basket of stowers, and a garland on her head, scattering flowers as she walks along the temple. Ceres, decorated with her implements of harvest, and a wreath of corn; Pomona, with a cornuco∣pia; Minerva, in a chariot of polish'd steel, drawn by lions; Diana, with her quiver; Tra∣gedy and Comedy, in their proper habits, fol∣lowed by the Nine Muses, the Fairy King and

Queen, and a Band of Fairies. Witches descend in thunder. Falstaff, Caliban, Pistol, and all SHAKESPEARE's favourite Characters, walk two and two down the temple; Apollo comes for∣ward, his chair rises, reveals a pair of lofty gates, he opens them, and discovers the statue of SHAKESPEARE.</STAGE>
