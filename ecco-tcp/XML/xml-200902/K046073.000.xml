<HEAD>TO SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE veneration I bear to the memory of Doctor Goldsmith, has drawn me into the present publication; and the sentiments of affection to be found in his Dedication of the DESERTED VILLAGE, have induced me to inscribe <HI>this</HI> Elegy to Sir Joshua Reynolds; who will naturally receive with kindness whatever is designed, as a testimony of justice, to a Friend that is no more.</P>
<P>In contemplating the death of this excellent man, and admirable poet, I have been led to contemplate likewise the fate of others; for within a very few years our literary losses have been fatally multiplied, and many of the most valuable members have been suddenly lopped off from science and society. In pursuit of this undertaking, where the same pathetic subject was to be considered to the end, I resolved to set out upon an irregular principle, that without enchaining myself to any critical uniformity, I might have scope and latitude for whatever varieties of versi∣fication should fall in my way.</P>
<P><PB REF="4"/>As I was to deplore the loss of different writers, each of which possessed very strongly a marking origi∣nality, I thought it best to write a sort of Epitaph upon each: accordingly, the following Verses are intended as so many separate Imitations of the style and manner of the Authors which they comme∣morate.</P>
<P>That the occasion which produced the Elegy, might not lose the strength of the impression, by delay—for alas, the traces of sorrow for the loss of the learned, are soon worn out by the tumults of life—I hurried the composition to the press, the moment I could withdraw my hand from the manuscript; the whole of which was begun and finished within a few hours after the news reached me, that Dr. Goldsmith was dead.</P>
<P>But I beg, Sir, you will excuse the length of this Address, and believe me to be</P>

<HEAD>THE TEARS OF GENIUS.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THE village-bell tolls out the note of death,</L>
<L>And thro' the echoing air, the length'ning sound,</L>
<L>With dreadful pause, reverberating deep;</L>
<L>Spreads the sad tydings, o'er fair Auburn's vale.</L>
<L>There, to enjoy the scenes her bard had prais'd</L>
<L>In all the sweet simplicity of song;</L>
<L>GENIUS, in pilgrim garb, sequester'd sat,</L>
<L>And herded jocund with the harmless swains:</L>
<L>But when she heard the fate-foreboding knell,</L>
<L>With startled step, precipitate and swift,</L>
<L>And look pathetic, full of dire presage,</L>
<L>The church-way walk, beside the neighb'ring green,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="6"/>Sorrowing she sought; and there, in black array,</L>
<L>Borne on the shoulders of the swains he lov'd,</L>
<L>She saw the boast of Auburn mov'd along.</L>
<L>Touch'd at the view, her pensive breast she struck,</L>
<L>And to the cypress, which incumbent hangs</L>
<L>With leaning slope, and branch irregular,</L>
<L>O'er the moss'd pillars of the sacred fane,</L>
<L>The briar-bound graves shadowing with funeral gloom,</L>
<L>Forlorn she hied; And there the crowding woe</L>
<L>(Swell'd by the parent) press'd on bleeding thought.</L>
<L>Big ran the drops from her maternal eye,</L>
<L>Fast broke the bosom-sorrow from her heart,</L>
<L>And pale Distress, sat sickly on her cheek,</L>
<L>As thus her plaintive Elegy began.</L>
<L>And must my children all expire?</L>
<L>Shall none be left to strike the lyre?</L>
<L>Courts Death alone a learned prize?</L>
<L>Falls his shafts only on the wise?</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="7"/>Can no fit marks on earth be found,</L>
<L>From useless thousands swarming round?</L>
<L>What crowding cyphers cram the land!</L>
<L>What hosts of victims, at command!</L>
<L>Yet shall th' Ingenious drop alone?</L>
<L>Shall Science grace the tyrant's throne?</L>
<L>Thou murd'rer of the tuneful train!</L>
<L>I charge thee, with my children slain!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Scarce has the Sun thrice urg'd his annual tour,</L>
<L>Since half my race have felt thy barbarous power;</L>
<L>Sore hast thou thinn'd each pleasing art,</L>
<L>And struck a muse with every dart:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Bard, after bard, obey'd thy slaughtering call,</L>
<L>Till scarce a poet lives to sing a brother's fall.</L>
<L>Then let a widow'd mother pay</L>
<L>The tribute of a parting lay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>
<L>Tearful, inscribe the monumental strain,</L>
<L>And speak aloud, her feelings, and her pain!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And first, farewel to thee, my son, she cried,</L>
<L>Thou pride of Auburn's Dale—sweet bard, farewel.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Long for thy sake, the peasants tear shall flow,</L>
<L>And many a virgin-bosom heave with woe,</L>
<L>For thee shall sorrow sadden all the scene,</L>
<L>And every pastime, perish on the green;</L>
<L>The sturdy farmer shall suspend his tale,</L>
<L>The woodman's ballad shall no more regale,</L>
<L>No more shall Mirth, each rustic sport inspire,</L>
<L>I ut every frolic, every feat, shall tire.</L>
<L>No more the evening gambol shall delight,</L>
<L>Nor moonshine revels crown the vacant night,</L>
<L>But groupes of villagers (each joy forgot)</L>
<L>Shall form, a sad assembly round the cot.</L>
<L>Sweet bard, farewel—and farewel, Auburn's bliss,</L>
<L>The bashful lover, and the yielded kiss;</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="9"/>The evening warble Philomela made,</L>
<L>The echoing forest, and the whispering shade,</L>
<L>The winding brook, the bleat of brute content,</L>
<L>And the blithe voice that "whistled as it went."</L>
<L>These shall no longer charm the plowman's care,</L>
<L>But sighs shall fill, the pauses of despair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>GOLDSMITH adieu! the "book-learn'd priest" for thee</L>
<L>Shall now in vain possess his festive glee,</L>
<L>The oft-heard jest in vain he shall reveal,</L>
<L>For now alas, the jest he cannot feel.</L>
<L>But ruddy damsels o'er thy tomb shall bend,</L>
<L>And conscious weep for their and virtue's friend:</L>
<L>The milkmaid shall reject the shepherd's song,</L>
<L>And cease to carol as she toils along:</L>
<L>All Auburn shall bewail the fatal day,</L>
<L>When from her fields, their pride was snatch'd away;</L>
<L>And even the matron of the cressy lake</L>
<L>In piteous plight, her palsied head shall shake,</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="10"/>While all adown the furrows of her face</L>
<L>Slow shall the lingering tears each other trace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And, Oh my child! severer woes remain,</L>
<L>To all the houseless, and unshelter'd train:</L>
<L>Thy fate shall sadden many an humble guest,</L>
<L>And heap fresh anguish on the beggar's breast.</L>
<L>For dear wert thou to all the sons of pain;</L>
<L>To all that wander, sorrow, or complain.</L>
<L>Dear to the learned, to the simple dear,</L>
<L>For daily blessings mark'd thy virtuous year;</L>
<L>The rich receiv'd a moral from thy head,</L>
<L>And from thy heart the stranger found a bed.</L>
<L>Distress came always smiling from thy door;</L>
<L>For God had made thee agent to the poor;</L>
<L>Had form'd thy feelings on the noblest plan,</L>
<L>To grace at once, the Poet, and the Man.</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="11"/>Here GENIUS paus'd to dry the gathering tear,</L>
<L>Which Nature started in her matron eye.</L>
<L>She paus'd an instant, then the strain renew'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THEE too, thou favourite of the moral strain,</L>
<L>Pathetic GRAY; for thee does GENIUS mourn:</L>
<L>Science and Taste, thy early fate shall plain,</L>
<L>And Virtue drop a tear into thy urn.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oft as Night's curtain closes on the day,</L>
<L>And twilight robes the clouds in duskier hue,</L>
<L>A love-lone visit to thy tomb I pay,</L>
<L>While all the parent trembles at the view.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For how to the unconscious worm a prey,</L>
<L>So dear a child as thee can I resign?</L>
<L>Ah, how can GENIUS e'er forget her GRAY?</L>
<L>Poet of Nature; all my powers, were thine!</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="12"/>On thy blest name, with melted heart I dwell,</L>
<L>Some kindred drops, a loss like thine, demands;</L>
<L>Thou, who could once for others, wail so well,</L>
<L>Now take THY tribute from a mother's hands.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tho' the grav'd tomb, and cloud aspiring bust</L>
<L>To Cam's clear margin, call not back thy breath,</L>
<L>Yet shall fair Fame immortalize thy dust,</L>
<L>And GENIUS snatch thee from the realms of death.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oft as I reach the spot where thou art laid,</L>
<L>Thou, whose bright sense could boast "celestial fire,"</L>
<L>Those hands, I cry, the Muses scepter sway'd,</L>
<L>"And wak'd to extacy the living lyre."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>One morn I miss'd thee from the favourite tree,</L>
<L>And anxious search'd the brook, the lawn, the grove;</L>
<L>Another came, but ah, it was not thee!</L>
<L>Oh the keen tortures of a parent's love!</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="13"/>Next, thro' the sculptur'd porch I saw thee borne</L>
<L>In slow procession by the sable train,</L>
<L>I saw thy corpse entomb'd beneath the thorn,</L>
<L>And o'er thy ashes sigh'd this funeral strain.</L>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>EPITAPH.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>Here low in dust, a son of Science lies,</L>
<L>By fame distinguished, and to Genius dear;</L>
<L>Forgive the fault, ye cynically wise,</L>
<L>If on his grave the parent sheds a tear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Long shall the Muses mourn their pensive friend,</L>
<L>Long shall a mother's bosom throb with woe,</L>
<L>O'er his lov'd tomb the duteous swains shall bend,</L>
<L>And Albion's daughters long bewail the blow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now sighing, stopt again the querulous power,</L>
<L>And ruminated thoughtful—o'er the turf,</L>
<L>Swell'd into mountains, by the mingled dead,</L>
<L>She cast a serious eye—and now the Hours,</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="14"/>The light-wing'd messengers of hoary Time,</L>
<L>Brought on the sable zenith of the night,</L>

<L>Rustled the light leaf of the spreading beech.</L>

<L>Her faint ray flung upon the shadowy earth!</L>
<L>Struck by the scene, Imagination turn'd</L>
<L>Reflective, on a loss still more severe;</L>
<L>A loss that all the Muses mourn at once.</L>
<L>The cheek of GENIUS stream'd with warmer tears,</L>
<L>Deepen'd the searching sigh, and throbb'd the heart,</L>
<L>As thus, at length the bursting grief found way:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Child of my heart—thou matchless soul of Song!</L>
<L>Guide of fair truth, and leading star of fame,</L>

<L>But when he wail'd his lovely Lucy, dead,</L>
<L>And his melodious sorrow told,</L>
<L>The shepherds lean'd to hear,</L>
<L>The silvans dropt a tear,</L>
<L>Then all in wild disorder fled.</L>
<L>Rapt in the deepest shades recess,</L>
<L>They mourn'd their gentle Lord's distress,</L>
<L>And join'd his prayers for Lucy—but in vain.</L>

<L>And art thou gone, my venerable Son,</L>
<L>Who shar'd with Genius the exalted throne!</L>
<L>Pride of my age, and pillar of my care!—</L>
<L>Mute is thy tuneful voice—"O loss beyond repair."</L>
<L>Ah LYTTELTON, for thee,</L>
<L>The true tear long shall bathe this hoary breast,</L>
<L>For there thy worth, and talents live imprest—</L>
<L>Engrav'd by SYMPATHY.</L>
<L><PB N="29" REF="27"/>Oh! fall severely felt,</L>
<L>To make a parent melt,</L>
<L>The tender breast to tear;</L>
<L>And wake despair:</L>
<L>And scarce a child the mighty grief to share!</L>

<L>How shall I paint the glories of his mind,</L>
<L>Benevolent, and kind,</L>
<L>His reason strong, and elegantly clear,</L>
<L>To every virtue dear!</L>
<L>Beyond the pride of pedant rules,</L>
<L>And maxims of the schools,</L>
<L>His Genius knew the pleasing art,</L>
<L>To steal upon the heart:</L>
<L>To touch the finer passions of the mind,</L>
<L>And give the sterling moral to mankind.</L>

<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<L>He was the very glory of my race,</L>
<L>Even in the vale of life, in reason's bloom,</L>
<L>Adorn'd with every learned grace,</L>
<L><PB N="30" REF="28"/>Amidst the shouts of power and praise,</L>
<L>For many a year he wore the bays;</L>
<L>Till tyrant Death</L>
<L>Stopt his much-honour'd breath,</L>
<L>And swept the laurel'd Hero to the tomb.</L>
<L>So when some oak, that long supreme hath stood,</L>
<L>The stately monarch of the imperial wood,</L>
<L>Whose arms superior shed a verdure round,</L>
<L>And shadow'd wide beneath, the umbrageous ground,</L>
<L>Long time we view its top impierce the skies,</L>
<L>Its broad leaf flourish, and its branches rise,</L>
<L>Long time we gaze upon the glowing sight,</L>
<L>And eye with wonder its majestic height</L>
<L>Till time, impatient for its destin'd prey,</L>
<L>Full at the root directs the blow,</L>
<L>And down it drops below;</L>
<L>The mighty ruin, of the groaning plain.</L>

<Q>Nor, in lamenting the havock, which Death hath triumphantly made (continued GENIUS) in the letter'd generation, can HAWKESWORTH, be forgotten: A name which is particularly endear'd to me, by the affection which its owner bore to virtue and to science.
<PB N="31" REF="29"/>
Every stroke of his pen, corresponding with every idea of his mind, however playful, or however pa∣thetic, always terminated in the most useful know∣ledge: that knowledge which might regulate the conduct of life, or afford tranquillity and quietude at the hour of expiration. The ardour which uniformly animated his endeavours, gave constant vigour to his thought, activity to his powers, and dignity to his sentiment: Nor did his excellence arise so much from the ambition which panted after fame, and aim'd at popularity—which appeal'd to the acclamations of the mob, or sought the distinctions of this world; as from the hearty hope of contributing, in whatever degree, to the investigation of truth, the amendment of man∣ners, and the rectitude of the mind. Of those who have acquir'd a literary immortality, there are few who could dispute with my HAWKESWORTH, strength of sense, or elevation of expression; and still fewer have given to the world so valuable, or so copious a fund of virtuous entertainment. Amidst all the efforts of his intellect, whether his instructions were prepared in the dress of history — or convey'd in the vehicle of fabulous narration—whether they assum'd the graver style of argumentative profundity, or whether they adopted the still deeper researches of philosophical raciocination; —their constant greatness of design was equally appa∣rent,
<PB N="32" REF="30"/>
and the promotion of virtue was always strongly mark'd in the language of the writer. My dear, my re∣gretted HAWKESWORTH, was indeed never long seduc'd by any temptations, or abstracted by any scientific allurements, from those views which are alone of in∣trinsic importance, and which he well knew, would retain that importance, when all, that now flutters to the fancy, plays upon the passions, and fascinates the heart, shall confess their insignificance, and fly like the atom, that is driven before the tempest.</Q>
<L>Here interrupting broke upon her plaint</L>
<L>The peering morn—the dun-discolour'd clouds,</L>
<L>Dispersing fast, unveil the fleecy white:</L>
<L>Fair dawns the new-born-day; and o'er the sky</L>
<L>The ruddy crimson, and the heaven-dipt blue,</L>
<L>Mix'd with the fainter yellow's streaky gold,</L>
<L>Chequering the air in rich variety,</L>
<L>Fortell the Sun's uprise—from his broad beam,</L>
<L>(Too garish for the melancholy mind)</L>
<L>GENIUS withdrew, and clos'd her tender lay.</L>
