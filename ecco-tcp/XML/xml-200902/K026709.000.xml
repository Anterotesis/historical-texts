<BYLINE>Written by Mr. GARRICK.</BYLINE>
<SP>
<STAGE>Spoken by Mrs. Bulkely.</STAGE>
<L>THO' I'm a <HI>female,</HI> and the rule is ever,</L>
<L>For us, in Epilogue, to beg your favour,</L>
<L>Yet now I take the lead—and, leaving art</L>
<L>And envy to the men—with a warm heart,</L>
<L>A <HI>woman</HI> here I come—to take a <HI>woman's part.</HI></L>
<L>No little jealousies my mind perplex,</L>
<L>I come, the <HI>friend</HI> and <HI>champion</HI> of my sex;</L>
<L>I'll prove, ye fair, that let us have our swing,</L>
<L>We can, as well as men, do any thing;</L>
<L>Nay, better too, perhaps—for now and then,</L>
<L>These times produce some bungling among men,</L>
<L>In spite of lordly wits—with force and ease,</L>
<L>Can't we write plays, or damn 'em, if we please?</L>
<L>The men, who grant not much, allow us charms—</L>
<L>Are eyes, shapes, dimples, then, our only arms?</L>
<L>To rule this man our sex dame Nature teaches;</L>
<L>Mount the high horse we can, and make long speeches;</L>
<L>Nay, and with dignity, some wear the breeches;</L>
<L>And why not wear' em?—We shall have your votes,</L>
<L>While some of t' other sex wear petticoats.</L>
<L>Did not a <HI>Lady Knight,</HI> late <HI>Chevalier,</HI></L>
<L>A brave, smart soldier to your eyes appear?</L>
<L>Hey'presto! pass! his <HI>sword</HI> becomes a <HI>fan,</HI></L>
<L>A comely <HI>woman</HI> rising from the <HI>man.</HI></L>
<L><PB REF="6"/>The French their Amazonian maid invite—</L>
<L>She goes—a like well skill'd to talk or Write,</L>
<L>Dance, ride, negociate, scold, coqet, or fight.</L>
<L>If she should set her heart upon a rover,</L>
<L>And be prove false, she'd kick her faithless lover.</L>
<L>The <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> own our boundless claim—</L>
<L>The Muses, Graces, Virtues, Fortune, Fame.</L>
<L>wisdom and Nature too, they <HI>women</HI> call;</L>
<L>With this sweet <HI>flatt'ry</HI>—yet they mix some gall—</L>
<L>'Twill out—the <HI>Furies</HI> too are <HI>females</HI> all.</L>
<L>The pow'rs of Riches, Physic, War, and Wine,</L>
<L>Sleep, Death, and Devils too—are <HI>masculine.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Are we unfit to rule?—a poor suggestion!</HI></L>
<L><HI>Austria</HI> and <HI>Russia</HI> answer well that question.</L>
<L>If joy from sense and matchless grace arise,</L>
<L>With your own treasure, <HI>Britons,</HI> bless your eyes.</L>
<L>If such there are—sure, in an humbler way,</L>
<L>The sex, without much guilt, may write a play:</L>
<L>That they've done nobler things, there's no denial;</L>
<L>With all your judgment, then, prepare for trial—</L>
<L>Summon your critic pow'rs, your manhood 'summon,</L>
<L>A brave man will <HI>protect,</HI> not <HI>hurt</HI> a <HI>woman;</HI></L>
<L>Let us wish modestly to share with men,</L>
<L>If not the <HI>force,</HI> the <HI>feather</HI> of the <HI>pen.</HI></L>

<SP>
<STAGE>Spoken by Mr. Lee Lewes.</STAGE>
<L>I Must, will speak—I hope my dress and air</L>
<L>Announce the man of fashion, and no player;</L>
<L>Tho' gentlemen are now forbid the scenes,</L>
<L>Yet have I rush'd thro' heroes, kings, and queens;</L>
<L>Resolv'd, in pity to this polish'd age,</L>
<L>To drive these ballad-heroes from the stage—</L>
<L>"To drive the deer with hound and horn,</L>
<L>"Earl Percy took his way;</L>
<L>"The child may rue, that is unborn,</L>
<L>"The hunting of that day."</L>
<L>A pretty basis, truly, for a modern play!</L>
<L>What! shall a scribbling, senseless woman dare</L>
<L>To your refinements offer such <HI>coarse</HI> fare?</L>
<L>Is Douglas, or is Percy fir'd wtth passion?</L>
<L>Ready for love or glory, death to dash on,</L>
<L>Fit company for modern still-life men of fashion?</L>
<L>Such madness will our hearts but slightly graze,</L>
<L>We've no such frantic nobles now a-days.</L>
<L>Heart-strings, like fiddlestrings, vibrate no tone,</L>
<L>Unless they're tun'd in perfect unison;</L>
<L>And youths of yore, with ours can ne'er agree—</L>
<L>They're in too <HI>sharp,</HI> ours in too <HI>flat</HI> a key.</L>
<L>Could we believe old stories, those strange fellows</L>
<L>Married for <HI>love</HI>—could of their wives be jealous—</L>
<L><PB REF="8"/>Nay, constant to 'em too—and, what is worse,</L>
<L>The vulgar souls thought cuckoldom a curse.</L>
<L>Most wedded pairs had then site purse, one mind,</L>
<L>One bed too—so preposterously kind—</L>
<L>From such barbarity (thank heav'n) we're mu'ch refin'd.</L>
<L>Old songs their happiness at home record,</L>
<L>From <HI>home they sep'rate carriages abhorr'd—</HI></L>
<L>One horse serv'd both—my lady rode behind my lord.</L>
<L>'Twas death alone could snap their bonds asunder—</L>
<L>Now tack'd so slightly, not to snap's the wonder.</L>
<L>Nay, death itself could not their hearts divide,</L>
<L>They mix'd their love with monumental pride,</L>
<L>For, cut in stone, they still lie side by side,</L>
<L>But why these gothic ancestors produce?</L>
<L>Why scour their rusty armour's? What's the use?</L>
<L>'Twould not your nicer optics much regale,</L>
<L>To see us beaux bend under coats of mail;</L>
<L>Should we our limbs with iron doublets bruise,</L>
<L>Good heav'n! how much court-plaister we should use;</L>
<L>We wear no armour now—but en our shoes.</L>
<L>Let not with barbarism true taste be blended,</L>
<L>Old vulgar virtues cannot be defended,</L>
<L>Let the dead rest—we living can't be mended.</L>

<P>What may this mean? Earl Douglas has injoin'd thee To meet him here in private?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDRIC.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my sister, And this injunction I have oft receiv'd; But when he comes, big with some painful secret, He starts, looks wild, then drops ambiguous hints, Frowns, hesitates, turns pale; and says' twas nothing; Then feigns to smile, and by his anxious care. To prove himself at ease, betrays his pain</P>

<SPEAKER>BIRTHA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Since my short sojourn here, I've mark'd this Earl,</L>
<L>And tho' the ties of blood unite us closely,</L>
<L>I shudder at his haughtiness of temper,</L>
<L>Which not his gentle wife, the bright Elwina,</L>
<L>Can charm to rest. Ill are their spirits pair'd,</L>
<L>His is the seat of frenzy, her's of softness,</L>
<L>His love is transport, her's, is trembling duty,</L>
<L>Rage in his soul is as the whirlwind fierce,</L>
<L>While her's ne'er felt the pow'r of that rude passion,</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDRIC.</SPEAKER>
<L>Perhaps the mighty soul of Douglas mourns,</L>
<L>Because inglorious love detains him here,</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>BIRTHA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Tho' every various charm adorns Elwina,</L>
<L>And tho' the noble Douglas doats to madness,</L>
<L>Yet some dark mystery involves their fate:</L>
<L>The canker grief devours Elwina's bloom,</L>
<L>And on her brow meek resignation sits,</L>

<L>Once, not long since, she thought herself alone;</L>
<L>Twas then the pent-up anguish burst its bounds;</L>
