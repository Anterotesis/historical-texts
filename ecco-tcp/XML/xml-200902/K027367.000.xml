<HEAD>TO Her Royal Highness THE PRINCESS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THAT high Station, which by Your Birth You hold above the People, exacts from every one, as a Duty, whatever Honours they are capable of paying to Your Royal High∣ness: But that more exalted Place, to which Your Virtues have rais'd You, a∣bove
<PB REF="4"/>
the rest of Princes, makes the Tribute of our Admiration and Praise, rather a Choice more immediately preventing that Duty.</P>
<P>The Publick Gratitude is ever founded on a Publick Benefit; and what is universally Bless'd, is always an universal Blessing. Thus from Your self we derive the Offerings which we bring; and that Incense which arises to Your Name, only returns to its Original, and but naturally requires the Pa∣rent of its Being.</P>
<P>From hence it is that this Poem, consti∣tuted on a Moral, whose End is to recom∣mend and to encourage Virtue, of conse∣quence has recourse to Your Royal High∣ness's Patronage; aspiring to cast it self be∣neath Your Feet, and declining Approbati∣on, 'till You shall condescend to own it, and vouchsafe to shine upon it as on a Crea∣ture of Your Influence.</P>
<P>'Tis from the Example of Princes that Virtue becomes a Fashion in the People, for even they who are averse to Instruction, will yet be fond of Imitation.</P>
<P><PB REF="5"/>
But there are Multitudes, who never can have Means nor Opportunities of so near an Access, as to partake of the Benefit of such Examples. And to these, Tragedy, which distinguishes it self from the Vulgar Poetry by the Dignity of its Characters, may be of Use and Information. For they who are at that distance from Original Great∣ness, as to be depriv'd of the Happiness of Contemplating the Perfections and real Ex∣cellencies of Your Royal Highnes's Person in Your Court, may yet behold some small Sketches and Imagings of the Virtues of Your Mind, abstracted, and represented in the Theatre.</P>
<P>Thus Poets are instructed, and instruct; not alone by Precepts which persuade, but also by Examples which illustrate. Thus is Delight interwoven with Instruction; when not only Virtue is prescrib'd, but also re∣presented.</P>
<P>But if we are delighted with the Liveliness of a feign'd Representation of Great and Good Persons and their Actions, how must
<PB REF="6"/>
we be charm'd with beholding the Persons themselves? If one or two excelling Quali∣ties, barely touch'd in the single Action and small Compass of a Play, can warm an Au∣dience, with a Concern and Regard even for the seeming Success and Prosperity of the Actor; with what Zeal must the Hearts of all be fill'd, for the continued and encreasing Happiness of those, who are the true and liv∣ing Instances of Elevated and Persisting Vir∣tue? Even the Vicious themselves must have a secret Veneration for those peculiar Graces and Endowments, which are daily so emi∣nently conspicuous in Your Royal High∣ness; and though repining, feel a Pleasure which in spite of Envy they per-force ap∣prove.</P>
<P>If in this Piece, humbly offer'd to Your Royal Highness, there shall appear the Re∣semblance of any one of those many Excel∣lencies which You so promiscuously possess, to be drawn so as to merit Your least Ap∣probation, it has the End and Accomplish∣ment of its Design. And however imperfect
<PB REF="7"/>
it may be in the Whole, through the Inex∣perience or Incapacity of the Author, yet, if there is so much as to convince Your Royal Highness, that a Play may be with Industry so dispos'd (in spight of the licenti∣ous Practice of the Modern Theatre) as to become sometimes an innocent, and not unprofitable Entertainment; it will abun∣dantly gratifie the Ambition, and recom∣pence the Endeavours of,</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Spoken by Mr. <HI>Betterton.</HI></BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>THE Time has been when Plays were not so plenty,</L>
<L>And a less Number New would well content ye.</L>
<L>New Plays did then like Almanacks appear;</L>
<L>And One was thought sufficient for a Year:</L>
<L>Tho' they are more like Almanacks of late;</L>
<L>For in one Year, I think, they're out of Date.</L>
<L>Nor were they without Reason join'd together;</L>
<L>For just as one prognosticates the Weather,</L>
<L>How plentiful the Crop, or scarce the Grain,</L>
<L>What Peals of Thunder, and what Show'rs of Rain;</L>
<L>So t'other can foretel, by certain Rules,</L>
<L>What Crops of Coxcombs, or what Floods of Fools.</L>
<L>In such like Prophecies were Poets skill'd,</L>
<L>Which now they find in their own Tribe fulfill'd:</L>
<L>The Dearth of Wit they did so long presage,</L>
<L>Is fall'n on us, and almost starves the Stage.</L>
<L>Were you not griev'd, as often as you saw</L>
<L>Poor Actors thresh such empty Sheafs of Straw?</L>
<L>Toiling and lab'ring, at their Lungs Expence,</L>
<L>To start a Jest, or force a little Sense.</L>
<L><PB REF="9"/>
Hard Fate for us! still harder in th' Event;</L>
<L>Our Authors Sin, but we alone Repent.</L>
<L>Still they proceed, and, at our Charge, write worse;</L>
<L>'Twere some Amends if they could reimburse:</L>
<L>But there's the Devil, tho' their Cause is lost,</L>
<L>There's no recovering Damages or Cost.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Good Wits, forgive this Liberty we take,</L>
<L>Since Custom gives the Losers leave to speak.</L>
<L>But if provok'd, your dreadful Wrath remains,</L>
<L>Take your Revenge upon the coming Scenes:</L>
<L>For that damn'd Poet's spar'd who Damns a Brother,</L>
<L>As one Thief 'scapes that Executes another.</L>
<L>Thus far alone does to the Wits relate;</L>
<L>But from the rest we hope a better Fate.</L>
<L>To please and move has been our Poet's Theme,</L>
<L>Art may direct, but Nature is his Aim;</L>
<L>And Nature miss'd, in vain he boasts his Art,</L>
<L>For only Nature can affect the Heart.</L>
<L>Then freely judge the Scenes that shall ensue,</L>
<L>But as with Freedom, judge with Candour too.</L>
<L>He wou'd not lose thro' Prejudice his Cause;</L>
<L>Nor wou'd obtain precariously Applause.</L>
<L>Impartial Censure he requests from all,</L>
<L>Prepar'd, by just Decrees to stand, or fall.</L>

<L>Believe me, Madam, I lament <HI>Anselmo,</HI></L>
<L>And always did compassionate his Fortune;</L>
<L>Have often wept, to see how cruelly</L>
<L>Your Father kept in Chains his Fellow-King:</L>

<L>Have stoln from Bed, and to his Prison crept;</L>

<SPEAKER>Leo.</SPEAKER>
<L>My Love of you, my Royal Mistress, gave me Cause,</L>
<L>My Love of you begot my Grief for him;</L>
<L>For I had heard, that when the Chance of War</L>
<L>Had bless'd <HI>Anselmo</HI>'s Arms with Victory,</L>
<L>And the rich Spoil of all the Field, and you,</L>
<L>The Glory of the whole, were made the Prey</L>

Then why am I? O when shall I have Rest?</L>

<L>Is there necessity I must be miserable?</L>
<L>Is it of moment to the Peace of Heav'n</L>

<L>My Griefs? Thou do'st already know 'em:</L>

<L>It was because thou didst not know <HI>Alphonso:</HI></L>

<L>His Worth, his Truth, and tenderness of Love.</L>

<L>The Memory of that brave Prince stands fair</L>

<L>If for my swelling Heart I can, I'll tell thee.</L>
<L>I was a welcome Captive in <HI>Valentia,</HI></L>
<L>Ev'n on the Day when <HI>Manuel,</HI> my Father,</L>
<L>Led on his conqu'ring Troops, high as the Gates</L>
<L>Of King <HI>Anselmo</HI>'s Palace; which in Rage,</L>
<L>And Heat of War, and dire Revenge, he fir'd.</L>
<L>Whilst the good King, to shun approaching Flames,</L>
<L>Started amidst his Foes, and made Captivity his Refuge.</L>
<L>Would I had perish'd in those Flames—</L>

<L><HI>Alphonso,</HI> who foresaw my Father's Cruelty,</L>
<L>Had born the Queen and me on board a Ship</L>
<L>Ready to sail, and when this News was brought</L>
<L>We put to Sea; but being betray'd by some</L>
<L>Who knew our Flight, we closely were pursu'd,</L>
<L>And almost taken; when a sudden Storm</L>
<L>Drove us, and those that follow'd, on the Coast</L>
<L>Of <HI>Africk:</HI> There our Vessel struck the Shoar,</L>
<L>And bulging 'gainst a Rock was dash'd in pieces.</L>
<L>But Heaven spared me for yet more Affliction!</L>
<L>Conducting them who follow'd us to shun</L>
<L>The Shoal, and save me floating on the Waves,</L>

<L>That Day, that fatal Day, our Hands were join'd;</L>

<L>And saw her Rate so far exceeding ours;</L>
<L>He came to me, and begg'd me by my Love,</L>
<L>I would consent the Priest might make us one;</L>
<L>That whether Death, or Victory ensu'd,</L>
<L>I might be his, beyond the Power of future Fate:</L>
<L>The Queen too did assist his Suit—I granted,</L>
<L>And in one Day, was wedded, and a Widow.</L>

<L>Enough; his Punishment be what you please.</L>
<L>But let me lead you from this Place of Sorrow,</L>
<L>To one, where young Delights attend; and Joys</L>
<L>Yet new, unborn, and blooming in the Bud,</L>
<L>That wait to be full-blown at your Approach,</L>
<L>And spread like Roses to the Morning Sun:</L>
<L>Where ev'ry Hour shall roll in circling Joys,</L>
<L>And Love shall wing the tedious-wasting Day.</L>
<L>Life without Love is Load; and Time stands still:</L>
<L>What we refuse to him, to Death we give;</L>
<L>And then, then only, when we love, we live.</L>

<L>BUT now, and I was clos'd within the Tomb</L>
<L>That holds my Father's Ashes; and but now,</L>
<L>Where he was Pris'ner I am too imprison'd.</L>
<L>Sure 'tis the Hand of Heav'n that leads me thus,</L>
<L>And for some Purpose points out these Remembrances.</L>
<L>In a dark Corner of my Cell I found</L>

<L>But Heav'n was deaf, Heav'n heard him not; but thus,</L>

<L>So did it tear the Ears of Mercy from</L>

His Voice, shutting the Gates of Pray'r against him.</L>
<L>If Piety be thus debarr'd Access</L>
<L>On high, and of good Men the very best</L>
<L>Is singled out to bleed, and bear the Scourge,</L>
<L>What is Reward? or what is Punishment?</L>
<L>But who shall dare to tax Eternal Justice!</L>
<L>Yet I may think—I may, I must; for Thought</L>
<L>Precedes the Will to think, and Error lives</L>
<L>E'er Reason can be born: Reason, the Power</L>
<L>To guess at Right and Wrong; the twinkling Lamp</L>
<L>Of wand'ring Life, that winks and wakes by turns,</L>

<L>To a vile Prison, and a captiv'd Wretch;</L>
<L>To one, whom had she never known she had</L>
<L>Been happy: Why, why was that Heav'nly Creature</L>

<L>Why does she follow, with unwearied Steps,</L>

<L>I've learn'd there are Disorders ripe for Mutiny</L>
<L>Among the Troops, who thought to share the Plunder,</L>
<L>Which <HI>Manuel</HI> to his own Use and Avarice</L>
<L>Converts. This News has reach'd <HI>Valentia</HI>'s Frontiers;</L>
<L>Where many of your Subjects, long oppress'd</L>
<L>With Tyranny and grievous Impositions,</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Osm.</SPEAKER>
<L>By Heav'n thou'st rouz'd me from my Lethargy.</L>
<L>The Spirit which was deaf to my own Wrongs,</L>
<L>Deaf to Revenge, and the loud Cries of my</L>
<L>Dead Father's Blood; nay, which refus'd to hear</L>
<L>The piercing Sighs and Murmurs of my Love</L>

<L>This Lesson, in some Hour of Inspiration,</L>

<L>And waking to the World and Mortal Sense,</L>
<L>Left this Example of his Resignation,</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Selim.</SPEAKER>
<L>Your Accusation highly has incens'd</L>
<L>The King, and were alone enough to urge</L>
<L>The Fate of <HI>Osmyn;</HI> but to that, fresh News</L>
<L>Is since arriv'd, of more revolted Troops.</L>
<L>'Tis certain <HI>Heli</HI> too is fled, and with him</L>
<L>(Which breeds Amazement and Distraction) some</L>
<L>Who bore high Offices of Weight and Trust,</L>
<L>Both in the State and Army. This confirms</L>
<L>The King, in full Belief of all you told him,</L>
<L>Concerning <HI>Osmyn</HI>'s corresponding with</L>
<L>The Heads of those who first began the Mutiny.</L>
<L>Wherefore a Warrant for his Death is sign'd;</L>

<L>What shall I say? Invent; contrive, advise</L>

<L>O! 'tis more Grief but to suppose his Death,</L>
<L>Than still to meet the Rigour of his Scorn.</L>
<L><PB N="41" REF="51"/>
From my Despair my Anger had its Source;</L>
<L>When he is dead I must despair for ever.</L>
<L>For ever! that's Despair—it was Distrust</L>
<L>Before; Distrust will ever be in Love,</L>
<L>And Anger in Distrust, both short-liv'd Pains.</L>
<L>But in Despair, and ever-during Death,</L>
<L>No Term, no Bound, but Infinite of Woe.</L>
<L>O Torment, but to think! what then to bear?</L>
<L>Not to be born—Devise the Means to shun it,</L>

<L>Who, at the Place of Execution, will</L>
<L>Attempt to force his way for an Escape.</L>

<L>None, Sir. Some Papers have been since discover'd</L>

<L>Still alive, were arming in <HI>Valentia:</HI></L>
<L>Which wears indeed this Colour of a Truth,</L>
<L>They who are fled have that Way bent their Course.</L>
<L>Of the same Nature divers Notes have been</L>
<L>Dispers'd, t'amuze the People; whereupon</L>
<L>Some ready of Belief have rais'd this Rumour:</L>
<L>That being sav'd upon the Coast of <HI>Africk,</HI></L>
<L>He there disclos'd himself to <HI>Albucacim,</HI></L>
<L>And by a secret Compact made with him,</L>

<L>I am a little slow of Credit, Sir,</L>
<L>In the Sincerity of Womens Actions.</L>
<L>Methinks this Lady's Hatred to the <HI>Moor,</HI></L>
<L>Disquiets her too much; which makes it seem</L>
<L>As if she'd rather that she did not hate him.</L>
<L>I wish her Mutes are meant to be employ'd</L>

<L>I'th' Evening <HI>Osmyn</HI> was to die; at Mid-night</L>
<L>She begg'd the Royal Signet to release him;</L>
<L>I'th' Morning he must die again; e'er Noon</L>

<L>But why that needless Caution of the Princess?</L>
<L>What if she had seen <HI>Osmyn?</HI> though 'twere strange.</L>
