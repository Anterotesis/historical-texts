<P>METHOUGHT I was once upon a time trave<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ling through a certain land which was ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> full of people, but, what was rather odd, not o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of all this multitude was at home; they were a bound to a far distant country. Though it w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> permitted by the Lord of the land that these P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦grims might associate together for their prese<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> mutual comfort and convenience; and each w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> not only allowed, but commanded to do the othe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> all the services he could upon their journey, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it was decreed, that every individual travell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> must enter the far country singly. There was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> great gulf at the end of the journey which eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦one must pass alone, and at his own risk, and t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> friendship of the whole united world could be no use in shooting that gulf. The exact time wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> each was to pass was not known to any, this the Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> always kept a close secret out of kindness, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> still they were as sure that the time must come, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> that at no very great distance, as if they w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> informed of the very moment. Now, as they kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> they were always liable to be called away at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hour's notice, one would have thought they wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> have been chiefly employed in packing up, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> preparing, and getting every thing in order. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they indeed. It was almost the only thing wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> they did not think about.</P>
<P>Now I only appeal to you, my readers, if any

Do you never look at the map <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> consult Brookes's Gazetteer? And don't you try <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pick up from your fellow passengers in the stage <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ach any little information you can get?

And above all, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you are likely to set out early, are you not afraid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> oversleeping, and does not that fear keep you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on the watch, so that you are commonly up and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ady before the porter comes to summon you? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ader! if this be your case, how surprised will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be to hear that the Travellers to the far coun∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> have not half your prudence, though bound <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a journey of infinitely more importance, to a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d where nothing can be sent after them, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which when they are once settled, all errors <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> irretrievable.</P>

<P>Among the chief attractions of <HI>The things below</HI> were certain little lumps of yellow clay, on which almost every eye and every heart was fixed.

Some whose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>es were immense, told me they were heaping up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their children; this I thought very right, till on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ting my eyes round, I observed many of the chil∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en of these very people had large heaps of their

Others told me it was for their grand-childre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but on enquiry I found these were not yet born, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in many cases there was little chance that they ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> would.

<P>Many however who had set out with a high he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of their father's raising, before they had got o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> third of their journey had scarcely a single pie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> left.

<P>In one place I saw large heaps exhausted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> order to set two idle pampered horses a runnin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but the worst part of the joke was, the horses <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not run to fetch or carry any thing, but merely let the gazers see which could run fastest.

<P>Now I found it was the opinion of sober pilgrims, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at either hoarding the clay or trucking it for any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ch purposes as the above, was thought exactly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e same offence in the eyes of the Lord, and it is expected that when they should come under <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> more immediate jurisdiction in the far country,
<PB N="12" REF="12"/>the penalty annexed to hoarding and squanderi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> would be nearly the same. While I examined t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> countenances of the owners of the heaps, I o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦served that those who I well knew never intend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to make any use at all of their heap, were f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> more terrified at the thought of losing it, or of bei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> torn from it, than those were who were employi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> it in the most useful manner.

Some, however, acted a more sensible pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and spent no more upon their mouldering te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦ments than just to keep them whole and clean, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in good repair, which is what every tenant oug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to do; and I observed that those who were mod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦rate in the care of their own tenements, were mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> attentive to repair and warm the ragged tenements <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> others. But none did this with much zeal or acce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦ance, but those who had acquired a habit of ov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> looking the <HI>things below,</HI> and also by the consta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> use of the Telescope, had got their natural we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and dim sight so strengthened, as to be able to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

For it was in this case parti∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ularly true, that things are only big or little by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mparison; and there was no other way of mak∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g the <HI>things below</HI> appear as small as they really <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re, but by comparing them by means of the Tele∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ope with the <HI>things above.</HI> But I observed that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e false judgment of the Pilgrims ever kept pace <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th their wrong practices, for those who kept their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es fastened on the <HI>things below,</HI> were reckoned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in their generation, while the few who look∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> forward to the future glories, were account∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> by the bustlers or heapers, to be either fools <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mad.</P>
<P>Well—most of these Pilgrims went on in adorn∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g their tenements, adding to their heaps, grasp∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g the <HI>things below</HI> as if they would never let <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>em go, shutting their eyes instead of using their te∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>scope, and neglecting their Title Deed, as if it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Parchment of another man's estate and not their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n; till one after another each felt his tenement <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>mbling about his ears.—O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>! then what a busy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>stling, anxious, terrifying, distracting moment was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at! What a deal of business was to be done, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat a strange time was this to do it in!

First some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was sent for to make over the yellow heaps to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>other, which the heaper now found would be of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> use to himself in shooting the gulf; a transfer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich ought to have been made while the tenement <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s sound. Then there was a consultation between
<PB N="16" REF="16"/>two or three masons at once, perhaps to try to pat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> up the walls, and strengthen the props, and stop <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> decays of the tumbling tenement; but not till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> masons were forced to declare it was past repairing (a truth they were rather too apt to keep back) di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the tenant seriously think it was time to pac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> up, prepare, and begone. Then what sending <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the wise men who professed to explain the Tit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Deed! And oh, what remorse that they had ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦lected to examine it till their senses were too con¦fused for so weighty a business! What reproache<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or what exhortations to others to look better after their own affairs! Even to the wisest of the inh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦bitants the falling of their tenements was a solemn thing; solemn but not surprising; they had lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> been packing up and preparing; they praised the Lord's goodness that they had been suffered to sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so long; many acknowledged the mercy of thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> frequent warnings, and confessed that those ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> dilapidations which had made the house uncomfor¦table had been a blessing, as it had set them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> diligent preparation for their future inheritance▪ had made them more earnest in examining their titl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to it, and had set them on such a frequent applica¦tion to the telescope, that <HI>The things above</HI> ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> seemed every day nearer and nearer.
