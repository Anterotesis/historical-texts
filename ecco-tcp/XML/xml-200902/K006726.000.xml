<P>Tho' merry I be, I never was so treated in my whole life, why you know our old mad Crazy, the beadle, I thought he might make some blunder in proclaiming, the proclamation of earl Goodwin and his sons, as traitors, so I took the bell and rung the people all about me, and there I stood like a hen and chickens, but I no sooner cried ' O Yes, O Yes' than I heard a voice like a gander in the marshes, screaming out' O No, O No' and who should this be but old Cra∣zy, for I having got the city bell, he hobbled with the 'pothecary's pestle and mortar, and clattered with such a devil of a noise, folks could not hear, and because I told him to be quiet, he flew at me and tripped up the leg of old corporal Standfast, tumbled over Kit the tinker, overturned father Fogarty, the fat fryar, and has mauled my nose in this manner—look—he fit for an office, indeed, an old driveller.</P>
