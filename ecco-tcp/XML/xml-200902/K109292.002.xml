<HEAD>THE SIGNIFICATION OF WORDS, esteemed SYNONYMOUS, IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE, INVESTIGATED.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="208" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>208. <HI>Effigy, Image, Statue.</HI></HEAD>
<P>CORPOREAL representation, is the common idea of these three words; but, an <HI>effigy,</HI> is, to supply the place of the real thing; an <HI>image,</HI> is, to shew the attitude,
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>and, design, but, in miniature; a <HI>statue,</HI> the same; but, as large as life.</P>
<P>Persons, who draw on themselves the popular odium, are, sometimes, hung in <HI>ef∣figy. Images</HI> are made of china, silver, &amp;c. and, set up in houses, by way of ornament. We erect <HI>statues</HI> of our kings, in grateful remembrance of them.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="209" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>209. To <HI>Give, Present, Offer.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Of these three words, that of <HI>give,</HI> is, generally, used in a familiar sense; that of <HI>present,</HI> in a respectful one; that of <HI>offer,</HI> in a religious one. We <HI>give</HI> to our servants. We <HI>present</HI> to princes. We <HI>offer,</HI> to God.</P>
<P>We <HI>give,</HI> what we would have received. We <HI>present,</HI> what we think, will be agree∣able. We <HI>offer,</HI> what, we imagine, will be acceptable.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="4"/>We cannot <HI>give,</HI> what does not belong to us, nor <HI>offer,</HI> what is not in our power; but, we, sometimes <HI>present,</HI> what is neither ours, nor, in our power to <HI>give.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="210" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>210. <HI>Frugality, Oeconomy,</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Frugality,</HI> implies, only, discretion of ex∣pence; <HI>oeconomy,</HI> includes, in its idea, some kind of management, in order to eke mat∣ters out.</P>
<P><HI>Frugality,</HI> is, generally, the province of the husband; whose business is, to take care, his expences do not exceed his in∣come: <HI>oeconomy,</HI> is, principally, the care of the wife; whose study is, by a prudent management, if possible, to make up every deficiency.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="211" TYPE="part">
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
<HEAD>211. <HI>Cloaths, Dress.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Cloaths,</HI> express, simply, that, which covers the body; and, includes all, for that purpose, from head to foot, and, nothing more; it is for this reason, we say, with propriety, the necessaries of life, consist in meat, drink, lodging, and, <HI>cloaths. Dress,</HI> has a more confined meaning; besides, that, of a bare covering, it, includes in its idea, a relation to form and fashion; as well to the ornaments, as the necessaries; thus, we say, a Spanish <HI>dress;</HI> a Hunga∣rian <HI>dress;</HI> a rich <HI>dress,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Though the sword and cockade, cannot be called <HI>cloaths;</HI> they are, nevertheless, part of the <HI>dress</HI> of an officer.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="212" TYPE="part">
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
<HEAD>212. <HI>Wonder, Astonishment, Amazement, Consternation. Surprize.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Of these words, that of <HI>wonder,</HI> implies, admiration at something extraordinary; <HI>astonishment,</HI> is, a sudden confusion of mind, arising from either fear or <HI>wonder; amaze∣ment,</HI> implies, a greater degree of <HI>astonish∣ment; consternation,</HI> such a degree, as almost borders upon horror, arising, chiefly, from dreadful circumstances; as to <HI>surprize,</HI> it means, only, being taken unawares.</P>
<P>Of all these words, <HI>wonder,</HI> and, <HI>surprize,</HI> are supposed to be nearest to each other, in signification; but, even between these, may be observed a difference; the first, be∣ing generally, considered, as relative to things, good in themselves, the latter, with respect to either good or bad. We are apt to <HI>wonder</HI> when a bad man does good, and, be <HI>surprized,</HI> when a good man does ill.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="7"/>Besides, <HI>wonder,</HI> includes in its idea, some small degree of consideration; <HI>sur∣prize,</HI> does not.</P>
<P>If a mean-spirited person, whom I have insulted, should come to me, in order, to sollicit a reconciliation; I should naturally, say; I am <HI>surprized,</HI> at his coming, but, when I reflect on the meanness of his spi∣rit, I do not much <HI>wonder.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wonder</HI> and <HI>surprize,</HI> act upon the mind; <HI>astonishment</HI> and <HI>amazement,</HI> upon the senses; <HI>consternation,</HI> upon the heart.</P>
<P>The words <HI>astonishment,</HI> and, <HI>amazement,</HI> equally, with that of <HI>surprize</HI> are used, be the matter referred to, either good or bad; but, <HI>consternation,</HI> is never made use of, but, with respect to bad.</P>
<P>We <HI>wonder,</HI> and, are <HI>surprized,</HI> at the miraculous events of providence. We are <HI>astonished</HI> and <HI>amazed,</HI> at the extra∣ordinary qualities of the magnet. An un∣expected calamity, will throw us, often, into the greatest <HI>consternation.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="213" TYPE="part">
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
<HEAD>213. <HI>Liberality, Generosity, Bounty.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A ready and willing distribution; accor∣ding to our abilities, is the general idea of these three words; but, they have each, a particular one, as follows: <HI>liberality,</HI> im∣plies, acts of mere giving or spending; <HI>generosity,</HI> acts of greatness; <HI>bounty,</HI> acts of kindness.</P>
<P>A <HI>liberal</HI> man, gives, freely; a <HI>generous</HI> man, nobly; and, a <HI>bountiful</HI> man, charitably.</P>
<P><HI>Liberality,</HI> is a natural disposition: <HI>gene∣rosity,</HI> proceeds from elevation of sentiment; <HI>bounty,</HI> from religious motives.</P>
<P><HI>Liberality,</HI> denotes, freedom of spirit; <HI>ge∣nerosity,</HI> greatness of soul: <HI>bounty,</HI> openness of heart.</P>
<P>Too great <HI>liberality,</HI> borders upon pro∣fuseness; it then, becomes a fault. <HI>Gene∣rosity,</HI> is a princely quality, and, if it does not exceed the bounds of our abilities, is, always, commendable. <HI>Bounty,</HI> is an amia∣ble virtue, and never goes unrewarded.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="214" TYPE="part">
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
<HEAD>214. <HI>Prepossessed, Opiniated, Obstinate, Infatuated, Headstrong.</HI></HEAD>
<P>These epithets denote a folly, which con∣sists in being too much wedded to our own opinion; but, that, which is particulariz∣ed by the word, <HI>prepossessed,</HI> seems to arise, from excess of prejudice, which seduces, and, causes us to think, what we have preconceived, the best; paying lit∣tle or no regard to the opinions of others. In one <HI>opiniated,</HI> this folly seems to be, the effect of an over-fondness for his own notions, and, a contempt for those, of o∣thers. <HI>Obstinacy,</HI> seems to spring, from an affected perverseness, which renders it intractable, and, which, against the rules of good-breeding, will never give way. An <HI>infatuated</HI> person, is supposed to be folly-struck, to suffer some loss of reason, which is the occasion of that inflexibility we observe in him. As to the word, <HI>head∣strong,</HI> though, often, used as synonymous
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>with the above; it appears to me, to have a greater relation to a man's actions, inti∣mating a blind determination, that stops his ears to every argument, and, renders him ungovernable.</P>
<P><HI>Prepossessed,</HI> and, <HI>opiniated,</HI> imply, a mind, strongly, prejudiced; <HI>obstinate,</HI> and, <HI>head∣strong,</HI> an unruly will; <HI>infatuated,</HI> a wan∣dering in the dark.</P>
<P>Thus, to be <HI>prepossessed, opiniated,</HI> or, <HI>infa∣tuated,</HI> is involuntary; to be <HI>obstinate,</HI> or, <HI>headstrong,</HI> voluntary.</P>
<P>A person <HI>prepossessed,</HI> follows his own opinions, after examining in some sort, those of others. One, who is <HI>opiniated,</HI> follows his own notions, implicitly, with∣out ever listning to those of others. <HI>Obsti∣nacy,</HI> pursues its own way, in spite of every opposition, and, often, through mere ca∣price. <HI>Infatuation</HI> acts so strongly, as in some measure, to take away that reason, which is the light of the mind; and thus dark∣ening it, leads a man into the grossest er∣rors. The <HI>headstrong</HI> person, often, acts through a spirit of opposition, and seldom leaves his course, till he has completed his ruin.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="215" TYPE="part">
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
<HEAD>215. To <HI>Lift, Raise,</HI></HEAD>
<P>We <HI>lift,</HI> in taking any thing up; we <HI>raise,</HI> in setting it upright, or, placing, ac∣cording to some order. Thus, we <HI>lift</HI> a weight, &amp;c. we <HI>raise</HI> the head; we <HI>raise</HI> a ladder; we <HI>raise</HI> a mast.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="216" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>216. To <HI>Institute, Found,</HI> To <HI>Establish, Endow.</HI></HEAD>
<P>To <HI>institute,</HI> is, to create and form things, having some relation to the author, or, him, who first contrived, or, laid down the plan. To <HI>found,</HI> is, to give birth to such plan. To <HI>establish,</HI> is, to fix that plan, upon a lasting basis. To <HI>endow,</HI> is to pro∣vide the necessaries, for its subsistence.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="12"/>After universities were once <HI>instituted,</HI> colleges were <HI>founded,</HI> though not at first <HI>endowed;</HI> since which, those noble <HI>institu∣tions,</HI> have been well <HI>established,</HI> by such <HI>en∣dowments,</HI> as do honour to our country.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="217" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>217. <HI>Chance, Fortune.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Chance,</HI> forms neither order or design; we neither attribute to it, knowledge, or, will, and, its events are, always, very uncertain. <HI>Fortune,</HI> lays plans and designs, but, with∣out choice; we attribute to it, a will, with∣out discernment, and, say, that it acts, blindly.</P>
<P>The chief of our successes, are more owing to <HI>chance,</HI> than skill: it is, some∣times, a long while, before <HI>fortune</HI> will look upon us, with a favourable eye.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="218" TYPE="part">
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
<HEAD>218. <HI>Lot, Destiny.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Lot,</HI> supposes, distinctions, and, a method of decision; we attribute to it, a hidden determination, which keeps us in doubt, till the instant, it shews itself. <HI>Destiny,</HI> forms designs, dispositions, and, connec∣tions; we attribute to it, knowledge, will, and, power; its views are determined, and, unalterable.</P>
<P><HI>Lot,</HI> decides; <HI>Destiny,</HI> ordains.</P>
<P>We observe many, so extremely rash, as to leave their lives, to the <HI>lot</HI> of a die. Whatever <HI>destiny</HI> decrees, is inevitable; be∣cause we can neither force its disposition, nor see, beyond the reach of its light.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="219" TYPE="part">
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
<HEAD>219. <HI>Religion, Piety, Devotion.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The word <HI>religion,</HI> is not considered here, as signifying the worship we owe to the Deity, and, the tribute of our dependance upon him; but, as denoting, a quality of the soul, and, a disposition of the heart, towards God: it is in this sense, only, that it is reputed as synonymous, with the other two. This disposition, then, prevents our fail∣ing in any part of our duty, to the Supreme Being. <HI>Piety,</HI> makes us acquit ourselves with greater respect and zeal. <HI>Devotion,</HI> adds to this, outwardly, a serious, composed behaviour.</P>
<P>It is sufficient, for a worldly person, to be <HI>religious; piety,</HI> agrees best with persons, who pride themselves in virtue, and, as to <HI>devotion,</HI> it is the employ of people, per∣fectly, recluse.</P>
<P><HI>Religion,</HI> is more internal; <HI>piety,</HI> is, both internal, and, external; <HI>devotion,</HI> is, some∣times, more external.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="15"/>Where there is no integrity, there is no <HI>religion.</HI> He, who fails in his respect, for religious worship, fails in <HI>piety. Devotion,</HI> unless sincere, is mocking the Most High.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="220" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>220. <HI>Able, Skilful, Learned.</HI></HEAD>
<P>That knowledge, which we can reduce to practice, makes us <HI>able;</HI> that, which requires speculation, makes us <HI>skilful;</HI> that, which fills the memory, makes us <HI>learned.</HI></P>
<P>We say, an <HI>able</HI> preacher or lawyer, a <HI>skilful</HI> mathematician or philosopher; a <HI>learned</HI> historian or civilian.</P>
<P><HI>Able,</HI> seems to imply, something, more extensive; <HI>skilful,</HI> something, more pro∣found; <HI>learned,</HI> something, more universal.</P>
<P>We become <HI>able,</HI> by long experience; <HI>skilful,</HI> by deep study; <HI>learned,</HI> by great reading.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="221" TYPE="part">
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
<HEAD>221. <HI>Empire, Kingdom.</HI></HEAD>
<P>These are names given to different do∣minions, whence princes take the title of emperor, or, king; 'tis not, however, in this alone, that their difference consists.</P>
<P>It appears to me, that the word, <HI>empire,</HI> conveys an idea of a vast territory, com∣posed of various people; whereas, that of <HI>kingdom,</HI> implies, one more bounded; and, intimates the unity of that nation, of which it is formed. It is, perhaps, from this difference of idea, that the different deno∣mination of states, and, the titles their princes enjoy, take their rise; if it is not, the only reason, it is at least, the common one, as, we may remark, in the <HI>empire</HI> of Germany, the <HI>empire</HI> of Russia, and, in the Ottoman <HI>empire,</HI> of whose diversity of peo∣ple and nations, the world is well acquaint∣ed; on the other hand, we see, in those states which bear the name of <HI>kingdom,</HI> such, as France, Spain, Poland, &amp;c. that
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>the division of provinces, does not destroy the unity of the people.</P>
<P>There is in <HI>kingdoms,</HI> a uniformity of fundamental laws; the difference of parti∣cular laws, arising from different customs, which, in no respect, hurt the unity of po∣litical administration. It is, from this uni∣formity, or, single government, that the words <HI>king,</HI> and, <HI>kingdom,</HI> take their rise; for this reason, also, though there may be many persons in the administration, there is, nevertheless, but one prince, or, sove∣reign minister: but, it is not the same in <HI>empires;</HI> one part of which, is, sometimes, governed by fundamental laws, very dif∣ferent from those, by which, another part of the same <HI>empire</HI> is governed: this di∣versity, destroys the unity of government; and, 'tis the submission of certain chiefs, to the command of a general superiour, that preserves the union of the state: it is, also, from this right of governing, that the words <HI>emperor,</HI> and, <HI>empire,</HI> are derived. Hence it is, that there are many sove∣reigns, and, <HI>kingdoms,</HI> in the same <HI>empire.</HI></P>
<P>The Roman dominion, was, originally, a <HI>kingdom;</HI> being formed of one single people; the name <HI>empire,</HI> was not given it,
<PB N="17" REF="18"/>till such time, as it brought under its sub∣jection, other foreign ones, who became, though in themselves distinct nations, members of that state, and, over whom, the Romans established one government, tho' they had separate administrations.</P>
<P>The advantages we find in the society of a body politic, contributes as much, on the part of subjects, to form <HI>kingdoms,</HI> as the desire of governing, on the part of princes. It was ambition, alone, that formed the plan of <HI>empires,</HI> which were established, and, are supported, chiefly, by the force of arms.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="222" TYPE="part">
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
<HEAD>222. <HI>Power, Ability, Faculty,</HI></HEAD>
<P>These words are explained, and, taken here, in a moral and literal sense: They all signify, a disposition in the subject, by means of which, it is capable of acting, or, producing an effect: but, that of <HI>power,</HI> results from supply, or, liberty of acting; <HI>ability,</HI> rises from strength; <HI>faculty,</HI> from natural properties.</P>
<P>A man, without the aids of grace, has not, even, the <HI>power</HI> of doing good. Youth, is in want of wisdom, to deliberate; old age, of <HI>ability,</HI> to execute. The human mind has the <HI>faculty</HI> of reasoning.</P>
<P>Our <HI>power,</HI> frequently, diminishes; by long use. Age destroys our <HI>ability,</HI> to satisfy the passions, though it does not, our desires. The mind, will often, lose its
<PB N="19" REF="20"/><HI>faculties,</HI> by accidents happening to the organs of the body.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="223" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>223. <HI>Pleasure, Delight.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The idea of <HI>pleasure,</HI> is, of a good, much more extensive than that, of <HI>delight;</HI> be∣cause, this word relates to a greater num∣ber of objects, than the other; whatever agreeably affects the mind, the heart, the senses, the fortune, &amp;c. produces <HI>pleasure.</HI> The idea of <HI>delight,</HI> rises upon that of <HI>plea∣sure,</HI> by force of opinion; but, is never∣theless, a good, of much less extent, with respect to objects; it is limited, properly, to sensation, and, has a particular relation, to good entertainment.</P>
<P>True philosophy, finds <HI>pleasure</HI> in every occupation. There cannot be a greater <HI>delight,</HI> than, in the true relish of innocent mirth.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="21"/>There is still another sense, in which these words are used; that, in which we say, of a person, that, he gives himself up, entirely, to <HI>pleasures;</HI> that, he enjoys the <HI>delights</HI> of the country. Taken in this last sense, they have, equally, as, in the other, their differences, and, particular niceties. Thus, <HI>pleasures,</HI> relate, more, to personal practice, such as customs, pastimes, and, recreations; <HI>delights,</HI> more, to the charms which are furnished by nature, art, and, opulence; such as, sweet habitations, stu∣died conveniences, and, choice company.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="224" TYPE="part">
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>
<HEAD>224. <HI>Content, Satisfaction.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Content,</HI> alludes, properly, to that in∣ward serenity of heart, which renders the soul sedate and composed. <HI>Satisfaction,</HI> re∣lates, more, to the passions; being a change, owing to some success, in which we hug ourselves.</P>
<P>No restless, or, turbulent man, can ever enjoy true <HI>content. Satisfaction,</HI> hardly, ever, accompanies immoderate ambition.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="225" TYPE="part">
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>
<HEAD>225. <HI>Excursion, Ramble, Jaunt.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Excursion,</HI> supposes, a pleasurable expe∣dition to some distant place, determined on, some time before. <HI>Ramble,</HI> implies, an irregular roving, in places unthought of, till the time we arrive there. By <HI>jaunt,</HI> is understood, a walk or journey; agree∣able to the person, who takes it, but, held in contempt by others, or, considered, as an act of levity.</P>
<P>We say, innocent <HI>excursions;</HI> wild <HI>ram∣bles;</HI> and, imprudent <HI>jaunts.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Excursions</HI> are necessary to persons, in a sedentary way of life, in order, to unbend the mind, and, exercise the body. <HI>Ram∣bling,</HI> is an evident sign of an unsteady disposition. <HI>Jaunts,</HI> in parties of pleasure, have been, often, attended with calamitous consequences.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="226" TYPE="part">
<PB N="23" REF="24"/>
<HEAD>226. <HI>Ale-house, Public-house.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Nothing is more common, than the ge∣neral use of these terms, to express one and the same thing, but, with great impro∣priety: though every <HI>ale-house</HI> is, un∣doubtedly, a <HI>public-house;</HI> it does not fol∣low, that every <HI>public-house,</HI> is an <HI>ale-house. Public-house,</HI> is a more extensive expression, implying a house, open for the entertain∣ment of the public; whereas, <HI>ale-house,</HI> is more limited, denoting, a particular species of <HI>public-houses,</HI> that, which is appropriated to the sale of beer. Thus, taverns, coffee∣houses, &amp;c. are <HI>public-houses;</HI> but, not <HI>ale∣houses.</HI></P>
<P>Gentlemen frequent many <HI>public-houses,</HI> without any sort of disgrace; but, it, al∣ways, lessens their character, to be seen in an <HI>ale-house.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="227" TYPE="part">
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>
<HEAD>227. <HI>Lie, Falsehood.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Contrariety to truth, is the general idea of these two words; but, that of <HI>lie,</HI> sup∣poses, always, something criminal; where∣as, that of <HI>falsehood,</HI> does not.</P>
<P>If questioned in a cause, wherein bound to tell the truth, we do not, we are guilty of a <HI>lie;</HI> if we deviate from truth, where there is no such obligation; it is no other, than a <HI>falsehood.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lies</HI> are, always, sinful; <HI>falsehoods,</HI> many times, justifiable. A <HI>lie,</HI> is an offence to God, and, a disgrace to man. A bene∣ficial <HI>falsehood,</HI> is preferable to a destruc∣tive truth.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="228" TYPE="part">
<PB N="25" REF="26"/>
<HEAD>228. <HI>Sea, Ocean.</HI></HEAD>
<P>By <HI>sea,</HI> is understood, a large body of water, opposed to land, confined within certain bounds; by <HI>ocean,</HI> a much larger body, whose utmost verge is not particu∣larly known. Thus, we say, the Baltic <HI>sea;</HI> the Mediterranean <HI>sea;</HI> the Adriatic <HI>sea;</HI> but, the Western <HI>ocean;</HI> the Atlantic <HI>ocean;</HI> the Pacific <HI>ocean:</HI> So, again, the wide <HI>sea;</HI> but, the vast <HI>ocean.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="229" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>229. <HI>Social, Sociable.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Of these two words, that of <HI>social,</HI> re∣lates, more, to a christian-like disposition; that of <HI>sociable,</HI> more, to a familiar one.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="27"/>'Tis goodness of heart, that makes a man <HI>social;</HI> sweetness of temper, that makes him <HI>sociable.</HI></P>
<P>Humanity, benevolence, beneficence, friendship, &amp;c. are the <HI>social</HI> virtues; good-nature, good-humour, condescenti∣on, &amp;c. are the qualities, that render <HI>sociable.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="230" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>230. <HI>Luxury, Voluptuousness.</HI></HEAD>
<P>In the general sense of these words, <HI>luxury,</HI> implies, a giving one's self up to pleasure; <HI>voluptuousness,</HI> an indulgence in the same, to excess.</P>
<P>The <HI>luxury</HI> of a people, is the forerun∣ner of their ruin. The <HI>voluptuous</HI> man wallows in sensuality, and, is void of the feelings of humanity.</P>
<P>Besides this distinction, there is one, far more delicate, and refined; and, which re∣quires some attention to be thoroughly
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>conceived. Notwithstanding, custom has, always, made use of the word <HI>voluptuous∣ness,</HI> in a bad sense, equally, with that of <HI>luxury;</HI> it appears to me, that it may, sometimes, be used, with propriety, in a good one. To comprehend this, properly, it must first, be considered, that <HI>luxury,</HI> im∣plies, gross corporal indulgence only; <HI>vo∣luptuousness,</HI> mental, as well as corporal. Thus, ebriety, epicurism, venery, &amp;c. are each, a species of <HI>luxury;</HI> but, we may be <HI>voluptuous,</HI> even, in things innocent in themselves, as, in the rapturous enjoyment of a fine prospect; the studied delightful∣ness of a rural retreat.</P>
<P>In this sense, <HI>lust,</HI> indulged to excess, is <HI>luxury;</HI> love, indulged to excess, <HI>voluptu∣ousness.</HI></P>

<P>A man may be <HI>sober,</HI> and, not <HI>temperate; temperate,</HI> yet, not <HI>abstemious.</HI></P>
<P>In that sense, in which these words are reputed synonymous, <HI>sobriety,</HI> implies, pre∣sent freedom from the power of strong li∣quor; <HI>temperance,</HI> signifies, moderation in drinking; and, by <HI>abstemiousness,</HI> is under∣stood, a refraining from all sorts of liquor, that may intoxicate.</P>
<P>Some men, who have the character of being <HI>sober,</HI> very little deserve it; as their freedom from intoxication, is more owing to strength of constitution, which resists the force of strong drink, than, to the vir∣tue of <HI>temperance.</HI> An <HI>abstemious</HI> person, practices the virtue of self-denial, and, by a rigid abstinence from all liquors, that may hurt him, keeps his head clear, and his constitution sound.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="30"/>A <HI>sober</HI> man, may drink much, and, not be affected with it. A <HI>temperate</HI> man, drinks little. An <HI>abstemious</HI> man, drinks not at all.</P>

<P>A <HI>satire,</HI> then, is commendable; a <HI>lam∣poon,</HI> scurrilous. The lash of <HI>satire,</HI> has been, often, found more beneficial to a state, than the scourge of power.

<P>By these three words, is meant a high building, raised above the main edifice; but, that of <HI>steeple,</HI> is more general; those, of <HI>spire,</HI> and, <HI>tower,</HI> more particular.</P>
<P><HI>Steeple,</HI> implies, the turret of a church; be it of what form soever. By <HI>spire,</HI> is understood, a <HI>steeple,</HI> rising taper to the top. By <HI>tower,</HI> is implied, a square <HI>steeple.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Spire,</HI> and, <HI>tower,</HI> then, are certain kinds of <HI>steeples.</HI> The <HI>steeple</HI> of St. Bride's church, London, is a <HI>spire;</HI> the <HI>steeple</HI> of St. Andrew's, a <HI>tower.</HI></P>
<P>The words, <HI>steeple,</HI> and, <HI>spire,</HI> are never applied, but to churches: The word, <HI>tow∣er,</HI> is, sometimes, made use of, with res∣pect to other large edifices.</P>
<P>In former times, palaces, and gentle∣men's seats, were, commonly, built with

Thus, we say, <HI>letters</HI> of friendship; <HI>letters</HI> of business; but, if these <HI>letters</HI> relate to public matters, or ap∣pear in print, we may, with elegance, call them <HI>epistles;</HI> as Paul's <HI>epistles;</HI> Ovid's <HI>epistles;</HI> Melmoth's <HI>epistles.</HI></P>

In this corrupted sense, then, I am obliged to consider them; as such, the word, <HI>gold,</HI> relates to the metal, of which a thing is made; that of <HI>golden,</HI> to the hue, it bears. Thus, we say, a <HI>gold</HI> ring; a <HI>gold</HI> watch; a <HI>gold</HI> buckle; but, the <HI>golden</HI> lion; the <HI>golden</HI> head; the <HI>golden</HI> lamp. That, these ideas are, often, con∣fused, is very evident; as, we, sometimes, hear of a <HI>golden</HI> cup, or, a <HI>golden</HI> ewer.

<HEAD>258. <HI>Expression, Word.</HI></HEAD>
<P>These words have been treated of be∣fore, when that of <HI>expression,</HI> was consi∣dered, as implying, a phrase of speech; but, there being another sense, in which, it is used, as synonymous with <HI>word,</HI> it may not be unnecessary to shew the diffe∣rence between them: and, as the distincti∣on is very delicate, we must view it with attention.</P>
<P><HI>Expression,</HI> then, represents the meaning: a <HI>word</HI> expresses the idea, which we em∣ploy to form that meaning. It is in order to use the <HI>expression,</HI> that the <HI>word</HI> is esta∣blished. The first, is natural, general, and, universal among all men; the second, is arbitrary, and, different according to the varied custom of the people. The YES, and, the No, are, always, and in all pla∣ces,
<PB N="55" REF="56"/>the same <HI>expressions;</HI> that is, they carry the same meaning; but, that mean∣ing is not expressed by the same <HI>words,</HI> in all languages, and, on all occasions.</P>
<P>We have the gift of <HI>expression,</HI> and, the knowledge of <HI>words:</HI> we give a turn, and, justness to the one; we choose, and, range the others.</P>
<P>The production of sense, and, formati∣on of a proposition, are what we expect from an <HI>expression:</HI> but, a <HI>word,</HI> is, com∣monly, of no other value, than to make a part of that sense, or, of that proposi∣on. Thus, <HI>expressions,</HI> differ among themselves, according to the difference of the senses they bear; and, <HI>words</HI> differ a∣mong themselves, either, by the simple ar∣ticulation of the voice, or, by the dif∣rent ideas they convey. A <HI>word,</HI> is no otherwise bad, than, by its not being in use, in the polite world.</P>
<P>A variety of <HI>expressions,</HI> proceeds not, al∣ways, from the fertility, and extent of the mind. An abundance of <HI>words,</HI> enriches
<PB N="56" REF="57"/>not the language, unless those <HI>words</HI> convey an abundance of ideas.</P>

<P><HI>Not,</HI> barely, expresses the negation; <HI>no,</HI> strengthens, and, seems to affirm it. The first, often, denies the thing, in part only, or, with limitation; the second, denies it, always, absolutely, wholly, and, without reserve. Thus we say, he has <HI>not</HI> money; he has <HI>not</HI> patience; meaning, he is <HI>not</HI> over∣burthened with either: but, when we say, he has <HI>no</HI> money; he has <HI>no</HI> patience; we would be understood to say, he has none at all.</P>
<P>It is on account of this limitation, that the word <HI>not,</HI> is, generally, used in com∣pany, with those words, that mark, either

<P>These words here, are considered, in no other sense, than, as they relate to lan∣guage; in which, that of <HI>great,</HI> seems to me, to have more relation to the learning, or, the nature of the subjects we treat of; and, that of <HI>subtime,</HI> more, to the spirit and manner, in which we treat them.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="59"/>Lock, on Human Understanding, is a very <HI>great</HI> work; Milton's Paradise Lost, is very <HI>sublime</HI> one.</P>
<P><HI>Great,</HI> or, scientific pieces, are, often, starched, and, discover the labour of the author; but, <HI>sublime</HI> pieces, tho' compos∣ed with a great deal of art, seem, always, natural.</P>
<P>Studied words, known only to the learn∣ed, joined to profound and metaphysical reasonings, form the <HI>great,</HI> or, elevated stile; expressions, equally just and brilli∣ant, joined to beautiful thoughts, finely and nobly turned, constitute the <HI>sublime.</HI></P>

<P>To <HI>excell,</HI> supposes, a comparison; is, being superior to all of the like kind; ex∣cludes equals, and, is applied to all sorts of objects.

<P>The Lord <HI>called</HI> every living creature be∣fore Adam, and, he <HI>named</HI> them.</P>

<P><HI>Qualities,</HI> form the character of per∣sons; <HI>talents,</HI> are their ornament. The first, render them, either, good or bad, and have a great influence over their morals. The second, make them useful or enter∣taining, and go a great way towards mak∣ing them esteemed.</P>
<P>We may use the word, <HI>quality,</HI> either, in a good or bad sense; but, we cannot take that of <HI>talent,</HI> in any other, than a good one.</P>
<P>Man, is a mixture of good and bad <HI>quali∣ties,</HI> sometimes, so strange as to possess the extremes of each: There are persons, possessed of such <HI>talents,</HI> as make them∣selves
<PB N="63" REF="64"/>admired, and, yet, give some pain to others, who would be witnesses of them; but, in this case, I should think it more eligible, to endure the caprice of the enter∣taining, than the disagreeableness of the tiresome.</P>
<P>The <HI>qualities</HI> of the heart, are, more es∣sential; those of the mind, more brilliant. <HI>Talents,</HI> which are of use in necessity, are more necessary; those, which conduce to entertainment, are best rewarded.</P>
<P>Our <HI>qualities</HI> render us, either, beloved or despised. Our <HI>talents,</HI> make our compa∣ny coveted.</P>

<P>We <HI>extol</HI> a person, to procure him the esteem of others, or, raise his reputation; we <HI>praise</HI> him, to testify the esteem, we have for him, or, to applaud him.</P>
<P>To <HI>extol,</HI> is, to say a great deal in the fa∣vour of others, and, ascribe to them great qualities, whether they possess them or not. To <HI>praise,</HI> is, to approve, with a kind of admiration, whatever they say or do, whether they deserve it or no.</P>
<P>We <HI>extol</HI> the abilities of a man; we <HI>praise</HI> his conduct.</P>
<P>The word, <HI>extol,</HI> supposes, that the person, of whom we speak, and the per∣son, to whom we speak, are diffrent; which the word, <HI>praise,</HI> does not.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="66"/>Quacks, never fail to <HI>extol</HI> themselves; they promise, always, more than they can perform; and, pride themselves in an ima∣ginary esteem. Conceited persons, fre∣quently <HI>praise</HI> themselves, and, are gene∣rally well satisfied with that <HI>praise.</HI></P>
<P>It is far more ridiculous, in my opinion, for a man to <HI>praise</HI> himself, than <HI>extol</HI> him∣self: for, we <HI>extol</HI> ourselves, through a de∣sire of having the esteem of others, which is a vanity, one may look over; but, when we are guilty of self-<HI>praise,</HI> it is done, through the great esteem we have for our∣selves, which is a pride insufferable.</P>

<P><HI>Darkness,</HI> seems to signify, something re∣al, in opposition to light: <HI>Obscurity,</HI> is, a mere privation of brightness.</P>
<P>We say, often, of <HI>darkness,</HI> that, it is thick; of <HI>obscurity,</HI> that, it is great.</P>
<P>Considering them, in a figurative sense, <HI>darkness,</HI> implies, a state of life, in which, we are shut up from the world; as, the state of a hermit; the state of a recluse. By <HI>obscurity,</HI> is understood, a state of retire∣ment, or, a state unnotic'd; as, when we re∣treat into the country, far from the obser∣vation of the public eye.</P>
<P>He, who lives in a state of <HI>darkness,</HI> is useless to society, and, dead, as it were, to mankind. He, who lives in a state of <HI>obscurity,</HI> enjoys a serenity, unknown to him, who revels in the open world.</P>

<HEAD>268. <HI>Vile, Bad.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Although the first, of these words, is not in very general use, with respect to the sense, in which, I would here consider it; yet, it is not so entirely disused, but, that I may characterise it, without fear of impropriety. As to the second word, it is not here taken in all its significations, but, in that only, in which, it is used as synonymous with the first.</P>
<P>Uselessness, and, little or no value, make a thing <HI>vile.</HI> Defect, and, loss of merit, render it <HI>bad.</HI> Thence it is, we say, in a mystic sense, that, we are <HI>vile</HI> creatures; intimating, that, we are nothing, with respect to God, or, that, he does not stand in need of our services; and, that, we say, he is a <HI>bad</HI> christian, who is void of faith, or, who has, through sin, lost the grace of baptism.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="71"/>He, is a <HI>vile</HI> subject, who is fit for no∣thing, or, who cannot be of any service to the community. He, is a <HI>bad</HI> subject, who will not attempt to do good, but, gives way to every vicious inclination.</P>
<P>A <HI>vile</HI> man, is contemptible, and, be∣comes the outcast of the world. A <HI>bad</HI> man, is condemnable, and, draws upon himself the hatred of every honest per∣son.</P>
<P>In speaking of useful things, as stuffs, linen, and, the like, the word <HI>vile,</HI> rises upon that of <HI>bad.</HI> That, which has been much used, but, will still serve, upon an occasion, is <HI>bad:</HI> that, which cannot be used any more, or, that, we cannot <HI>use,</HI> with credit, is <HI>vile.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bad</HI> cloaths are not, always, a mark of poverty. There is, sometimes, more pride under a covering of <HI>vile</HI> rags, than, under that, of gold and purple.</P>

<P>Besides, there seems to be less variety in a <HI>view,</HI> than, in a <HI>prospect.</HI> Thus, we say, the pleasing <HI>prospect</HI> of the neighbouring villages. The fine <HI>view</HI> of a distant moun∣tain.</P>

<HEAD>281. <HI>Love, Gallantry.</HI></HEAD>
<P>As different as these words may appear, they have, nevertheless, been, and, are still, frequently, used, as synonymous, when in∣tended to imply courtship. It may not be then unnecessary, to point out their pecu∣liar ideas.</P>
<P><HI>Love,</HI> is more sanguine, than <HI>gallantry;</HI> having for its object, the person, whom we are studious to please, through a view of possessing; and, whom we love as much, on her account, as our own: it takes possession of the heart, suddenly, and, owes its birth, to a certain something, which enchains the sentiments, and, draws the esteem, with∣out any examination, or, information. <HI>Gallantry,</HI> is more sensual, than <HI>love;</HI> hav∣ing for its object, the sex; we enter into in∣trigues, in hopes of enjoying it, and, love,
<PB N="83" REF="84"/>more on our own account, than on that, of our mistress. It acts upon the senses, much more than upon the heart, and, is more, owing to constitution, and, com∣plexion, than, to the force of beauty.</P>
<P>The one, has a power of making those persons agreeable in our eyes, who study to please the object of our love, provided, they in no respect raise our jealousy. The other, engages us to keep an eye upon all those, who are capable, either, of forward∣ing, or, hurting our designs; and, to watch them, as we would a rival, taking every advantage within our reach.</P>
<P>The first, leaves us not the liberty of choice; it commands in the beginning, as a master, and, reigns, afterwards, as a tyrant, till we are accustomed to its chains, by length of time; or, till they are broken by the efforts of powerful reason, or, the caprice of continued vexation. The second, suffers, sometimes, another passion to get before it; reason and inte∣rest, often, hold the bridle, and, make it give way to our situation, and, affairs.</P>
<P><HI>Love,</HI> attaches us, solely, to one person, and, delivers up our heart, without reserve,
<PB N="84" REF="85"/>so as to engage it, wholly, and, make every other object, of what beauty or merit so∣ever, indifferent to us. <HI>Gallantry,</HI> rivets us, generally, to all persons, who are either beautiful or agreeable, and, unites us to those, who make the least returns to our eagerness and desire; in such a manner, however, as leaves us no liking for others.</P>
<P>It appears to me, that <HI>love,</HI> delights in difficulties; so far from being weakened by obstacles, they, generally, increase it; and, we make it one of our most serious engagements. As for <HI>gallantry,</HI> it banishes formality, is less accustomed to difficulty, and, is often entered into, merely, for amusement. It is for this reason, we ob∣serve more spirit of <HI>gallantry</HI> in men, than <HI>love:</HI> for, it is rare to find a first <HI>love,</HI> fol∣lowed by a second; and, I doubt, whether ever it can be said, by a third: but, <HI>gal∣lantries</HI> are, sometimes, without number, and, succeed each other, till that age ar∣rives, when their source is dried up.</P>
<P>There is, always, honesty in <HI>love;</HI> but, it is troublesome and capricious; we con∣sider it, now-a-days, as a distemper, or, as a weakness of mind. In <HI>gallantry,</HI> there
<PB N="85" REF="86"/>is a degree of knavery, but, it is free and good humoured; and, is become the taste of the age.</P>
<P><HI>Love,</HI> designs on the imagination, the flattering idea of eternal happiness, in the entire and constant possession of the object we <HI>love. Gallantry,</HI> fails not to paint there the agreeable image of a singular pleasure, in the enjoyment of the object we pursue; but, neither the one, nor, the other, co∣pies after nature; experience shewing us, that their colours, however agreeable, are, equally, deceitful. All the difference we find, is, that <HI>love,</HI> being more serious, the unfaithfulness of its pencil, gives greater offence; and, the recollection of the pain it has given, in seeing it so ill rewarded, creates our disgust; whereas, <HI>gallantry,</HI> be∣ing more wanton, we are less sensible of the fallacy of its colouring, and, the vain notions we have of being arrived at the end of its designs, reconcile any disappoint∣ments, we may have met with.</P>
<P>In <HI>love,</HI> it is the heart, which, princi∣pally, tastes the pleasure; the mind, making itself a slave, without any regard; and, the satisfaction of the senses, contributing less
<PB N="86" REF="87"/>to the sweet enjoyment, than a certain con∣tentedness of soul, which produces the charming idea, of being in the possession of what we love, and, receiving the most sensible proofs of a tender return. In <HI>gal∣lantry,</HI> the heart, is less affected with the object; the mind, being more free, to in∣dulge itself, and the senses, more atten∣tive to their own satisfaction, partake the pleasure with greater equality; voluptuous∣ness, contributing more to its enjoyment, than the delicacy of sentiments.</P>
<P>When we are too much tormented by the caprices of <HI>love,</HI> we endeavour to disen∣tangle ourselves, and, become indifferent. When we are too fatigued by the exercises of <HI>gallantry,</HI> we take a resolution to desist, and, become sober.</P>
<P>Excess makes <HI>love</HI> degenerate into jea∣lousy; and, <HI>gallantry,</HI> into libertinism. In the first case, we are subject, to trouble of mind; in the second, we are in danger, of destroying our health.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, <HI>love,</HI> is, generally, justi∣fiable; <HI>gallantry,</HI> always, blameable.</P>

<HEAD>284. To <HI>Grow, Increase.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Things <HI>grow,</HI> by the nourishment, they receive; they <HI>increase,</HI> by the addition, that is made to them, of the same kind. Corn <HI>grows;</HI> the harvest <HI>increases.</HI></P>
<P>The better, we manure the land; the faster, the trees <HI>grow;</HI> and, the more, our revenues <HI>increase.</HI></P>
<P>The word, <HI>grow,</HI> signifies, only, the augmentation, independant of that, which occasions it. The word, <HI>increase,</HI> gives us to understand, that, that augmentation is caused, by a fresh quantity which, casually, joins it. Thus, to say, that, the river <HI>grows</HI> larger, is, to say, only, that, the water is risen, without expressing, that, it is become so, by the arrival of an additional quantity of water: but, to say, that, the river is <HI>increased,</HI> is, to say, that, it is swelled, by
<PB N="90" REF="91"/>a fresh quantity of water. This distinction, is, extremely, delicate; it is for this reason, therefore, that we make use of the words, <HI>grow,</HI> and, <HI>increase,</HI> indifferently, on many occasions, where that delicacy of choice, is of no great importance, as in the exam∣ple I have mentioned; for, we may say, with equal propriety, that a river either <HI>grows</HI> larger, or, <HI>increases,</HI> although, each of these words, has its particular idea. But there are other occasions, where, it is pro∣per, and, sometimes, even, necessary, to pay a regard to the peculiar idea, and, make some kind of choice between these terms, according to the strength of mean∣ing, we would give our thoughts: for ex∣ample, when we would be understood to say, speaking of the passions, that, they are in our nature, and, that the nourish∣ment, we take to support life, at the same time, gives strength to them; the use of the word, <HI>grow,</HI> would be elegant. Other∣wise, we might employ that of <HI>increase,</HI> with respect, either to the passions, or, the talents of the mind.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="92"/>The passions, in general, receive birth, and, <HI>grow,</HI> with the man; but, there are some, which exist, but, for a time, and which, after having <HI>increased,</HI> to a certain age, diminish, and, disappear, with the powers of nature: there are others, which last the whole life, and, which are always <HI>increasing,</HI> so as to be stronger in old age, than in youth.</P>
<P>Love, which forms itself in infancy, <HI>grows,</HI> with age. True courage, never brags; it <HI>increases,</HI> at the sight of danger. Ambition <HI>grows,</HI> proportionably, as our wealth <HI>increases.</HI></P>
<P>It is easy, to see, through all these ex∣amples, that, one of these words will agree in some places, in which the other will not: for what person is so little delicate, in ex∣pressing himself, as, not to perceive, by his natural taste, if not on reflexion, that, there is more propriety in saying, ambition <HI>grows,</HI> proportionably, as our wealth <HI>in∣creases,</HI> than to say, ambition <HI>increases,</HI> pro∣portionably, as our wealth <HI>grows.</HI> If it is not difficult to perceive this delicacy, it is,
<PB N="92" REF="93"/>to explain the reason of it: to do this, I must express myself, a little metaphysically, and, have recourse to such ideas, as may enable me to explain it: these ideas, however, shall be no other, than the proper ones. Since wealth consists in many different things, which unite them∣selves in the possession of one single person; the word, <HI>increase,</HI> which, as I have said before, denotes the addition of a fresh quantity, agrees better with it, than, that of <HI>grow,</HI> which, precisely marks the aug∣mentation of one single thing, caused by some sort of nourishment. For this same reason, the word, <HI>grow,</HI> agrees best with ambition, it being a single passion, to which wealth serves, as a kind of nutriment, to support it, and, make it act, with more force and ardour.</P>
<P>Corporeal things <HI>grow,</HI> by an inward and mechanical addition, which is, in effect, their proper and real nutriment; they <HI>in∣crease,</HI> by the bare outward addition of a fresh quantity of the same matter. Spi∣ritual things <HI>grow,</HI> by a kind of nourish∣ment,
<PB N="93" REF="94"/>considered in a figurative sense; they <HI>increase,</HI> by the addition of degrees, they bear.</P>
<P>An egg does not begin to <HI>grow,</HI> in the ovaria, till it teems, that is, till fruitful∣ness, has made it fit, to receive nourish∣ment; nor, does it leave the body, till its bulk is, sufficiently, <HI>increased,</HI> to cause an alteration in the membrane, that en∣closes it.</P>
<P>Our pride <HI>grows,</HI> in proportion, as we exalt ourselves; and, <HI>increases,</HI> sometimes, till we become contemptible in the eyes of the world.</P>

<P>To change our posture from recumbent, to erect; is the true meaning of the verb, to <HI>rise;</HI> whereas, to <HI>get up,</HI> implies, rather, to climb: thus, we <HI>rise,</HI> from the ground; we <HI>rise,</HI> from our bed; we <HI>rise,</HI> from our seat.

<HEAD>286. <HI>Copy, Model.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The sense, in which these words are re∣puted synonymous, does not, instantly, pre∣sent itself to the reader; the first glance of the eye, that shews us a <HI>copy,</HI> made after an original work, and <HI>a model,</HI> made as the original of a work, throws them, so far dis∣tant from each other, as, not to admit the least similitude; but, a second reflection, will make us sensible, that custom has used these two words, under one common idea, on many occasions; and, that, to denote equally, the original, after which a work is made, and, the work, made after the original; <HI>copy,</HI> having been understood, as well as <HI>model,</HI> to mean the first work, by which we, form the second: and, <HI>model,</HI> as
<PB N="96" REF="97"/>well as <HI>copy,</HI> the second work, formed after the first. Thus, then, they have been con∣sidered, as, in a manner, doubly synony∣mous; but, they have each their peculiar ideas, as follow.</P>
<P>In the first sense, <HI>copy,</HI> should be never used, but, with respect, to the manuscript of an author, upon which the printer works. <HI>Model,</HI> may be used, on every other occa∣sion, as well, with respect to morality, as the arts.</P>
<P>A proof sheet is not, often, very incor∣rect, unless the <HI>copy</HI> is so. Booksellers, who, often, refuse to purchase excellent <HI>co∣pies;</HI> frequently, buy bad ones, at too great a price. There is no perfect <HI>model</HI> of virtue. I should imagine, that the arts and sciences would gain more ground, if artists and authors would pursue more their own genius, than imitate the <HI>models,</HI> they meet with.</P>
<P>In the second sense, <HI>copy,</HI> is used, for painting; <HI>model,</HI> for relief. A <HI>copy,</HI> ought to be faithful; a <HI>model,</HI> just. The second, of these words, seems to suppose, a greater resemblance, than the first.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="98"/>Some <HI>copies,</HI> are so, extremely well per∣formed, as, to be little inferior to the ori∣ginals. <HI>Models</HI> of antiquity, are, frequent∣ly, more expressive, than modern origi∣nals.</P>

<HEAD>287. <HI>Precision, Abstraction.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The common idea of these two words, is, that of a separation made, by the force of the mind, in the consideration of ob∣jects; but, difficult as it is, to find out their peculiar ideas, and, determine their respective characteristics, I have attempted it, in the best manner, I am able.</P>
<P><HI>Precision,</HI> then, separates things, distinct in themselves, in order, to prevent the confusion, which arises from a jumble of
<PB N="98" REF="99"/>ideas. <HI>Abstraction,</HI> if I may use the expression, separates things, that are in themselves inseparable, in order, to consider them apart, independent one of another. The first, is the effect of the justness, and, clearness of the understand∣ing, which prevents our adding any thing, that is useless, or, foreign to the subject we treat of; consequently, it will agree, in every circumstance, either, with respect to affairs, or, sciences. The second, is the effort of a metaphysical mind, which re∣moves, from the point of view all, that we would detach from the subject; it in some respect mutilates, but, sometimes, contributes to the discovery of truth, and, sometimes, draws it into error. We may however use it, but, with care.</P>
<P>It appears to me, that <HI>precision,</HI> is, more applicable to things, which may not only be considered apart, but, may be con∣ceived, to be one, without the other, such as, for example, alms, and, charity; and, <HI>abstraction,</HI> more particularly, to things, which may indeed be considered apart, but, which cannot be conceived to
<PB N="99" REF="100"/>be one, without the other, as, body, and, size. Thus, the design of <HI>precision,</HI> is, to prevent a wandering from the subject, re∣moving, for that purpose, all, that is foreign to it; and, that of <HI>abstraction,</HI> to obviate our entering into the utmost ex∣tent of it, considering only one part, with∣out any regard to the other.</P>
<P>There is no science more certain, or, more clear than, that of geometry; it mak∣ing very exact <HI>precisions:</HI> There are, how∣ever, certain metaphysical <HI>abstractions,</HI> blend∣ed with it, which make geometricians fall into errors, equally, with others; not in∣deed when size and quantity are in questi∣on, but, with respect to physics.</P>
<P>Our ideas cannot be too <HI>precise;</HI> but, it is, sometimes, dangerous, to have them too <HI>abstracted.</HI> The first, is the surer way of arriving at the truth, in science, and, our aim, in affairs; whereas, the second, often, puts us farther from both.</P>
<P><HI>Precision</HI> is the gift of nature, receiving its birth with the mind; those, who are endowed with it, are excellently qualified for conversation; we listen to them with
<PB N="100" REF="101"/>pleasure, because they listen to us, in re∣turn: they understand what is said to them, equally, as they make themselves under∣stood. <HI>Abstraction,</HI> is the fruit of study, produced by profound application; those, who are familiar with it, talk of common things, sometimes, with too great refine∣ment; simple, and, natural subjects, are in their conversation, very difficult to com∣prehend, in the manner, they speak of them.</P>
<P><HI>Precise</HI> ideas, embellish common lan∣guage, and, make it in my opinion, sub∣lime. <HI>Abstracted</HI> ideas, are very tiresome, they seem to me, to be of little use, except, in the schools, or, in certain learned de∣bates.</P>
<P>We express by <HI>precise</HI> ideas, the most simple, and, most sensible truths; but, we cannot prove them otherwise, than, by ideas, very <HI>abstracted.</HI></P>

<P>The <HI>astronomer,</HI> is, thoroughly, acquaint∣ed with the course, and, motion of the celes∣tial bodies; the <HI>astrologer,</HI> reasons upon their influence. The first, observes the state of the heavens, marks the order of time, the eclipses and revolutions which arise from laws, established by the first spring of nature, in that immense number of spheres of which the universe consists; and, hardly ever errs in his calculations. The second, foretels events, casts nativi∣ties, prognosticates rain, cold, heat, and, all the variations of the weather; but sel∣dom, if ever, calculates to any purpose. The one, explains what he knows, and, merits the esteem of the learned; the
<PB N="103" REF="104"/>other, vends his imaginations, and, seeks the admiration of the vulgar.</P>
<P>We apply ourselves to <HI>astronomy,</HI> through a desire of knowledge. We dive into <HI>astrology,</HI> from disquietude about events to come.</P>
<P>The generality of people, look upon <HI>astronomy,</HI> as a science of mere curiosity, and, of little utility; not reflecting, that, its object, is the arrangement of seasons, the regulation of time, and, the various motions of the heavenly bodies; all which, is of great service to agriculture, to the proper ordering of every thing, in civil and political life, and, is the necessary ground∣work of geography, and, the art of naviga∣tion. But, when, on such reflections, they come to know, that, without this science, history and chronology would be nothing but confusion, perpetually, contradicting each other, on account of the different manner, in which different nations regu∣late their days and years; they would pay that respect to <HI>astronomy,</HI> and, its professors, as their merit deserves. <HI>Astrology,</HI> is, at present, much less in vogue, than it was,
<PB N="104" REF="105"/>formerly; either, because men are grown less credulous; that, the love of truth, is more the taste of the learned part of man∣kind, than, the desire of dazzling, or, im∣posing upon the world; or, because the brilliancy of reputation, does not, in this age, depend, so much upon the number of fools we make, as, upon the approbation of the discerning, and, the wise.</P>

<P>Although the word <HI>attachment,</HI> may, sometimes, be used, with respect to things bad, in themselves; it is, however, appli∣ed, with more propriety, when an honest or moderate passion is in question, than, either
<PB N="105" REF="106"/>of the two others. As, for example, we are <HI>attached,</HI> to our duty, to our friends, to our families, and, to virtuous women, whom we esteem. That of <HI>passion,</HI> is more applicable with respect to things, less ap∣proved, or, when they are carried to ex∣cess; thus, men, are said to have a <HI>passion</HI> for gaming, for women, &amp;c. As to the word <HI>devotion,</HI> though I have ranked it here, as most agreeable to the other two substan∣tives; the idea, it is supposed to convey, is best comprehended by the preterite of the verb, <HI>devote;</HI> the substantive <HI>devotion,</HI> being, very rarely used in this sense: by it, then, is understood, an implicit obedi∣ence, or, a perfect disposition to conform in every thing. Thus, we say, a man is <HI>devoted</HI> to his prince, to his master, to his benefactor, to a lady, who has acquired an absolute empire over him.</P>
<P><HI>Attachment</HI> is strong; <HI>passion,</HI> is violent; <HI>de∣votion,</HI> has no reserve.</P>
<P>The first, unites us, to what we love; the second, to what we thirst after; and, the third, makes us submit, to the will of those, we are desirous of serving.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="107"/>The manners of the present age have banished from the laws of friendship, all <HI>attachment,</HI> contrary to interest. We dare not confess a <HI>passion,</HI> for any thing, through fear of censure.

<P>Life, would not be agreeable, without some <HI>attachment.</HI> A <HI>passion,</HI> for any one thing, generally, gives as much pain, as pleasure. It is difficult, to please the great, without <HI>devoting</HI> ourselves, entirely, to their will.</P>

<P>We become <HI>in love,</HI> with a woman, whose beauty affects the heart; we become her <HI>lover,</HI> by waiting on her.</P>
<P>Variety of tender sentiments, crowd into the breast of a man, <HI>in love.</HI> Passionate airs, appear, with caution, in the behaviour of a <HI>lover.</HI></P>
<P>We are, often, very much <HI>in love,</HI> with∣out daring to appear a <HI>lover.</HI> We, fre∣quently, declare ourselves a <HI>lover,</HI> without ever being <HI>in love.</HI></P>
<P>It is, always, the passion, that constitutes our being <HI>in love,</HI> of which, the possession
<PB N="108" REF="109"/>of the object, is the only end we propose. Reason and interest may form the <HI>lover,</HI> of whom, an honest establishment, or, some particular advantage, is the chief aim, or, tendency.</P>
<P>It is very, rare, to be <HI>in love,</HI> with two persons at the same time; there is none, that I ever heard of, except, Phillis of Siro, who was so much <HI>in love,</HI> with two men, that she could not give the preference, or, her company, to either one, or, the other: but, it is not, very, rare, to find a man, at the same time, the <HI>lover,</HI> of many mis∣tresses; which, they continue to be, fre∣quently, to the very hour of marriage. We may, also, be <HI>in love,</HI> with one person, and, the <HI>lover</HI> of another; I speak of that case, where interest engages us to the one, whilst, we sigh in secret for her, whom it is not convenient for us, to marry.</P>

<HEAD>292. <HI>Absent, Inattentive.</HI></HEAD>
<P>These two words, equally, express want of attention; but, with this difference, that, it is our own inward ideas, occupy∣ing us, so fully, as to prevent our atten∣tion, to any other thing that offers, which renders us <HI>absent;</HI> whereas, 'tis some fresh outward object, attracting our attention, in such a manner, as to turn it, from what, we at first gave it to, or, from what we ought to give it to, that makes us <HI>inatten∣tive.</HI> When these faults are become habi∣tual, they are very inconvenient in our commerce with the world.</P>
<P>We are <HI>absent,</HI> when we think not of any present object, or, any thing, that is said to us. We are <HI>inattentive,</HI> when we pay more regard to any other object, than, to that, which is proposed to us, or, when
<PB N="110" REF="111"/>we listen to any other conversation, than, to what is addressed to us.</P>
<P>Very studious persons, and, those, who have great affairs upon their hands, or, are endued with strong passions, are more apt to be <HI>absent,</HI> than others; their internal ideas and designs quite engrossing them. Young people are the most apt to be <HI>inat∣tentive;</HI> a mere nothing, being sufficient to amuse and divert their attention.</P>
<P>Our <HI>absence</HI> of mind, is owing to thoughtfulness; our <HI>inattention,</HI> to cu∣riosity.</P>
<P>The mind of an <HI>absent</HI> man, is never where, he himself is; nothing round him, makes the least impression on him; he is, often, at Athens or Rome, in the midst of London or Paris; and, frequently, muses upon politics, or, geometry, while the con∣versation, perhaps, runs upon love, or, gal∣lantry. The mind of an <HI>inattentive</HI> man, is, always, present with him; is caught by every thing, he either sees or hears; he quits his attention to one thing, in order, that he may attend to another; listening to all that is said, both on the right and
<PB N="111" REF="112"/>left; he, frequently, understands not tho∣roughly, or, comprehends but in part, which makes him liable to take things, sometimes, in a quite opposite sense, to what they are meant.</P>
<P>The <HI>absent</HI> man, cares little for conver∣sation; the <HI>inattentive</HI> man, loses the fruit of it. When we are in company with the former, we had best give ourselves up to silent meditation; when, with the latter, we had better wait for their attention, till every other object is out of their way.</P>
<P>A new passion, if strong, seldom fails to render us <HI>absent.</HI> We can scarce help being <HI>inattentive,</HI> when listening to a tire∣some story; or, when we hear, on the other side, something more interesting.</P>

<P><HI>Reservedness,</HI> is good, at all times; but, it is, absolutely, necessary, in public, and, in company with our superiors; any li∣berty, they may seem to wink at, giving some degree of offence: for, they reserve to themselves a certain title to respect, the
<PB N="119" REF="120"/>failure of which, they consider, as an un∣pardonable fault. <HI>Modesty,</HI> is an ornament to persons, who have some pretence for carrying their head higher than others; and to those, who are possessed of some known and distinguished merit; but, to all other persons, it is an indispensable virtue, and, a quality, without which, they cannot appear becoming, or, avoid ridicule.</P>

<P>It is the reproach of conscience, that makes us <HI>ashamed;</HI> but, the sentiments of modesty, that make us <HI>bashful.</HI> Both one and the other, throw a colour into the face, but, when we are <HI>ashamed,</HI> we redden; when <HI>bashful,</HI> we blush.</P>

<HEAD>299. To <HI>Finish, Cease, Leave off.</HI></HEAD>
<P>We <HI>finish,</HI> by putting the last hand to a work. We <HI>cease,</HI> in quitting it, entirely. We <HI>leave off,</HI> in discontinuing.</P>
<P>To <HI>finish</HI> a discourse, properly, we should do it, just before it begins to grow tiresome. We ought to <HI>cease</HI> from our pursuits, as soon as we discover them to be useless. We should not <HI>leave off</HI> work, but, to refresh ourselves, that we may begin again, with fresh spi∣rits, and, more vigour.</P>
<P>Man is born to trouble; he has no sooner <HI>finished</HI> one affair, than another suc∣ceeds; he may indeed seek repose and tran∣quillity, but, Providence will not permit him, in this life, to <HI>cease</HI> from labour; and, if want of spirits, or, fatigue induces him, sometimes, to <HI>leave off</HI> his work, it is not, for any length of time; he is, presently,
<PB N="122" REF="123"/>obliged to return to his task, and, continue his employ.</P>
<P>That is, certainly, a good maxim, which says, we should not begin a thing, which we cannot <HI>finish;</HI> but, that, in my opinion, is much better, which forbids our <HI>ceasing</HI> from one work, in order, to begin another, without necessity obliges us. When our mind is employed, it is necessary, sometimes, to <HI>leave off;</HI> not, at that time, when the ima∣gination, full of fire, finds itself best capa∣ble of its task; but, only, at the first ins∣tant, we perceive it flag; it being wrong, either, to stop it, in its career, or; attempt to drive it, when it stops.</P>

<P>A <HI>project,</HI> is, a plan, or, an arrangement of means, in order, to execute a <HI>design.</HI> The <HI>design,</HI> is, what we propose to execute.</P>
<P>We, commonly, say of <HI>projects,</HI> that, they are fine; of <HI>designs,</HI> that, they are great.</P>
<P>The beauty of <HI>projects,</HI> depends upon their order and magnificence. The grandeur of <HI>designs,</HI> rises from the advantage and glory they may procure. We should not suffer ourselves, to be dazzled with the beauty of the one, or, the grandeur of the other; for practice does not, often, agree with speculation; the admirable order of a sys∣tem, and, the advantageous idea, which we form from it, do not, always, prevent <HI>projects</HI> from running aground, or, put <HI>designs</HI> out of the possibility of failing.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="127"/>The experience of all ages, teaches us, that heads, fruitful in great <HI>designs,</HI> and, excellent <HI>projects,</HI> are, frequently, chimeri∣cal.</P>
<P>The word <HI>project,</HI> is taken, also, for the thing we even propose to execute, as well, as that, of <HI>design.</HI> But though these words, considered in that sense, are, more, nearly synonymous, we shall, nevertheless, find a difference, very conspicuous to those, who have any delicacy of taste. The following, is such, as I am able to discover.</P>
<P>It appears to me, that <HI>project,</HI> relates, to something, more, distant; <HI>design,</HI> to something, more, near. We make <HI>pro∣jects,</HI> for the time to come; we form <HI>de∣signs,</HI> for the time present. The first, is, more, vague; the other, more, deter∣mined.</P>
<P>The <HI>project</HI> of an avaritious man, is, to enrich himself; his <HI>design,</HI> is, to amass money.</P>
<P>A good minister of state, has no other <HI>project,</HI> than the glory of his prince, and, the happiness of the subject. A good ge∣neral, studies as much to conceal his own <HI>designs,</HI> as, discover those of his enemy.</P>

<P>To conceive things, that are <HI>fine,</HI> we need, only, sufficient comprehension; but, it requires taste, to conceive that, which is <HI>delicate.</HI> The first, is within the reach, of many persons; the second, but of few.</P>
<P>A <HI>fine</HI> discourse is, sometimes, usefully, repeated to those, who do not, at first, com∣prehend it: but, he, who perceives not the <HI>delicate,</HI> at first glance, will never perceive it. We may seek, the one; but, must catch, the other.</P>
<P>The word, <HI>fine,</HI> is of more extensive use; we apply it, equally, with respect to the strokes, of ill-will, as to those, of good. The application of the word, <HI>delicate,</HI> is more rare; it agrees not with any thing malicious, but, is used, with most propriety, with respect to things, in themselves, flat∣tering.

<P>Rakes, pride themselves, more, in being fickle, than, in the <HI>steadiness</HI> of their en∣gagements. If the affections of the ladies, do not last, for ever; it is less owing to a

<P>We <HI>conceal,</HI> by a profound secret, that, which we would not have known. We <HI>dis∣semble,</HI> by reserve, that, which we would not have appear. We <HI>disguise,</HI> by contrary ap∣pearances, that, which we would not lay open to the penetration of others.</P>
<P>It requires care and attention, to <HI>conceal;</HI> art and cleverness, to <HI>dissemble;</HI> labour and cunning, to <HI>disguise.</HI></P>
<P>He, who would <HI>conceal,</HI> throws, as it were, a veil, over himself, that, he may not betray himself, through indiscretion. He, who would <HI>dissemble,</HI> throws a veil, over the eyes of others, that, what he does, or, says,
<PB N="135" REF="136"/>may not fall within the reach of their know∣ledge. He, who would <HI>disguise,</HI> never opens himself, any otherwise, than, to elude.</P>
<P>Were we to enter into affairs of interest, or, policy, we should, always, <HI>conceal</HI> our de∣signs; often, <HI>dissemble;</HI> and, sometimes, <HI>disguise</HI> them: with respect to matters, which concern the heart, we should be more frank.</P>
<P>It is sufficient, to <HI>conceal,</HI> from those, who cannot see, without some additional light; we must <HI>dissemble,</HI> with those, who can see, without any such accessary bright∣ness; but, it is necessary, to <HI>disguise</HI> tho∣roughly, from those, who, not content to piece through the darkness that opposes, ex∣amine into that light, with which, we would dazzle them.</P>
<P>When we have not resolution, to cor∣rect our faults, we should, at least, have wisdom, to <HI>conceal</HI> them. That maxim of Louis the XIth of France, which says, in order, to know how to reign, we should know how to <HI>dissemble;</HI> is very just, even, with respect to domestic government. When the necessity of circumstances, and

<P>We <HI>adjust</HI> matters; we <HI>reconcile</HI> minds.</P>
<P>It seems impossible, to <HI>adjust</HI> the liber∣ties of the Gallic church, with the preten∣sions of the court of Rome; sooner or la∣ter, one must necessarily destroy the other; for, it will, always, be difficult to <HI>reconcile</HI> the maxims of their parliaments, with the opi∣nions of the consistory.</P>

<P>Want of justness in the mind, is what, commonly, prevents schoolmen, from <HI>ad∣justing</HI> their disputes. A precise knowledge of the value of every word, in all the dif∣ferent circumstances, wherein, they may be used, would go a great way, towards <HI>recon∣ciling</HI> authors.</P>

<P><HI>Benediction,</HI> appears to me, to be limited, to the decretory pronounciation of happi∣ness. <HI>Blessing,</HI> is a more general expression, intimating, the various means of happiness.</P>
<P>Religious men, find as much comfort, in the <HI>benediction</HI> of the church; as others ex∣perience, in the <HI>blessings</HI> of life.</P>
<P><HI>Blessing,</HI> seems to intimate, divine favour; <HI>benediction</HI> that, which is human.</P>
<P>We say, the <HI>blessing</HI> of God; the <HI>bene∣diction</HI> of the priest.</P>
<P>Heaven showers down its <HI>blessings</HI> upon the virtuous. The <HI>benediction</HI> of a good man, is a very desirable thing.</P>

<P>The general idea of these words, is, that of a minister, representing the person of his sovereign, sent from one court to another; but, <HI>ambassador,</HI> seems to be superior to that of <HI>resident.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Ambassadors,</HI> are not supposed, to stay long at the court, to which they are sent; their office being, to transact some state affairs between the two powers. <HI>Residents,</HI> are supposed, to reside, for some considera∣ble time, as a testimony of the good harmo∣ny between the two states.</P>

<HEAD>325. <HI>Betwixt, Between.</HI></HEAD>
<P>If any two words, in the English lan∣guage, may be said to carry the same mean∣ing, these, in some respect, may. As a studied delicacy, here, is not, immediately, essential, custom has made no other distincti∣on, than, that, of using the word, <HI>between,</HI> on every occasion, as, being softer on the tongue; and, almost banishing the use of the word, <HI>betwixt,</HI> as, being much harsh∣er: but, as I deviate, from the common opi∣on, and, think, there is no word so trivial, but the choice of it, on particular occasions, may be necessary; I hope, I may not be condemned, as too nice, with respect to the word before us.</P>
<P><HI>Betwixt,</HI> then, appears to me, to be used, with most propriety, when that, which is
<PB N="149" REF="154"/>in the middle, is, as it were, embraced by the other two; <HI>between,</HI> when that, which is in the middle, is at some distance, from the other two. Thus, to speak properly, with respect to a house, standing in a row, we should use the word, <HI>betwixt;</HI> as, for example, the house, I dwell in, stands <HI>be∣twixt</HI> two high houses: but, with respect to a tree, standing in a line with others, we should use the word, <HI>between;</HI> as, for in∣stance, the oak tree, I mentioned, stands <HI>between</HI> two elms.</P>

<P>Death, brought on, by a stoppage of breath, is the general idea of these three words; but, that of <HI>suffocated,</HI> implies, an ex∣tinction of life occasioned by being in a place where we cannot breathe; that of <HI>smothered,</HI> by being in a place, where we are not suffered to breathe; that of <HI>choaked,</HI> by having the wind-pipe closed.</P>
<P>Thus, men are, frequently, <HI>suffocated</HI> by smoke. Persons, raving mad, when in curable, are, sometimes, <HI>smothered,</HI> between two fea∣ther beds. Malefactors, when hanged, are <HI>choaked.</HI></P>
<P>It has happened, that travellers, by fal∣ling into bogs, have been, sometimes, <HI>suf∣focated,</HI>

<HEAD>335. To be <HI>sorry for, Regret.</HI></HEAD>
<P>We are <HI>sorry for</HI> the misfortunes of ano∣ther; we <HI>regret</HI> his absence. The one, is the effect of pity; the other, of attach∣ment.</P>
<P>Grief, occasions our <HI>sorrow:</HI> repentance, excites our <HI>regret.</HI></P>
<P>A court favourite, in prosperity, is the object of envy; but, when he falls into disgrace, no one is <HI>sorry for</HI> him. Those princes, who are most commended, du∣ring their life, are not, always, most <HI>regret∣ted,</HI> after their death.</P>
<P>The expression, <HI>sorry for,</HI> when used, with respect to ourselves, in some measure, changes its signification. Retaining the common and general idea of sensibility, it
<PB N="162" REF="167"/>ceases to express that particular motive of pity, that makes us sympathise, inwardly, for the distresses of others; and, in its room, marks, only, a certain uneasiness, which discovers itself, outwardly. When we are <HI>sorry for</HI> the misfortunes of others, we are, often, inwardly touched, and, per∣haps, no outward sign of it shall appear: when we are <HI>sorry for</HI> our own; we shew it, outwardly, in order, to draw the compassi∣on of others. This expression is, some∣times, used, in another sense, besides that, mentioned; instead of motives of pity, it denotes, motives of repentance: In this sense, we say, he is <HI>sorry for</HI> the steps he has taken.</P>
<P>As much taken up, as we may be, with ourselves, there are eertain moments, when we are <HI>sorry for</HI> the distresses of o∣thers. However philosophical we may pretend to be, it is extremely difficult, to suffer, a long time together, without shewing some signs of sorrow. Mercenary people, are <HI>sorry for</HI> every step they take, that does not turn out to advantage. We often,
<PB N="163" REF="168"/>seem to <HI>regret</HI> the absent, in order, to affront the person present.</P>
<P>A hard heart, is <HI>sorry for</HI> no one. An in∣sensible man, is never <HI>sorry for</HI> any thing, that happens to him. A miserly person, <HI>regrets</HI> every morsel he eats.</P>
<P>We should never be <HI>sorry for</HI> a man, who suffers deservedly; for ourselves, when we can procure no kind of comfort; nor, for any trouble we take, when prudence enjoins it. we should not <HI>regret</HI> the departure of a friend, when his absence, will turn out to his advantage.</P>

<P>It is the air and behaviour, that renders <HI>pleasing;</HI> good sense and good humour, that renders <HI>agreeable.</HI></P>
<P>We love, the company of a <HI>pleasing</HI> man; because he charms. We covet, the com∣pany of an <HI>agreeable</HI> man; because he di∣verts.</P>
<P>Well-bred persons, are, always, <HI>pleasing.</HI> Merry persons, are, commonly, <HI>agreeable.</HI></P>
<P>How difficult is it, to avoid being at∣tached to one, of a <HI>pleasing</HI> address, and, <HI>a∣greeable</HI> coversation!</P>
<P>It appears to me, that it is, more, the behaviour, than the air, that makes the men <HI>pleasing;</HI> and, that, it is, rather, the air, than the behaviour, that makes the wo∣men, so. It seems to me, also, that, it is, rather, good sense, and, a liveliness in
<PB N="168" REF="173"/>conversation, that constitutes <HI>agreeableness,</HI> in the men; and, that, it is an even tem∣per, and, a merry disposition, that esta∣blishes that quality, in the women.</P>
<P>When these words are used, otherwise, than to denote personal qualities, that of <HI>plea∣sing,</HI> properly speaking, implies, something, which flatters the sense, or, self-love; that, of <HI>agreeable,</HI> something, which agrees with the taste, and, the mind.</P>
<P>It is <HI>pleasing,</HI> to have, always, desireable objects before us. Nothing is more <HI>agree∣able,</HI> to a joyous man, than good company.</P>

<P>Both the one, and, the other of these words denote that, which is done without difficulty; but, the first, excludes diffi∣culty, which arises from obstacles and op∣positions; the second, that which springs from the very nature of the thing. Thus, we say a <HI>ready</HI> entrance, when no one stops the passage; an <HI>easy</HI> entrance, when the passage is large and commodious. For the same reason, we say, of a woman, without reserve; that, she is <HI>ready</HI> of ac∣cess:
<PB N="171" REF="176"/>and, of a shoe, that does not pinch; that, it is <HI>easy.</HI></P>
<P>It appears to me, best, to use the word, <HI>ready,</HI> in naming the action; and, that of <HI>easy,</HI> in expressing the event, of that action. Thus, speaking of a commodious harbour, I should say, we have there, a <HI>ready</HI> land∣ing; and, that it is <HI>easy,</HI> to land there.</P>
<P>Of these two adjectives, there are form∣ed, two adverbs, <HI>easily,</HI> and, <HI>readily.</HI> Which, besides the difference of ideas, remarked in their originals, have one peculiar to themselves; which, I should not, here, omit taking notice of.

<P>In works of the mind, they are both very far from pleasant: but, the <HI>flat,</HI> ap∣pearing to affect the graces; displeases: the <HI>insipid,</HI> appearing to have no know∣ledge; tires.</P>
<P>In relation to the beauty of the sex, I do not think the word, <HI>insipid,</HI> should be used, but with respect to those, who are of a disposition, wholly, insensible: but, we say, beauty is <HI>flat,</HI> when it is not animated, and,

Thus, the occupations of a carpenter, taylor, baker, &amp;c. are <HI>trades;</HI> those of a linnen-draper, mercer, haberdasher, &amp;c. are <HI>businesses;</HI> those of a physician, coun∣sellor, musician, &amp;c. are <HI>professions.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Divination,</HI> brings hidden things to light; <HI>prediction,</HI> fortells what will come to pass.</P>
<P>The first, regards things present and past. The objects of the second, are things to come.</P>
<P>A learned and discerning man, one, who knows what relation, the least outward signs, bear to the motions of the soul, rea∣dily, passes with the world, as well-skilled in <HI>divination.</HI> A wise man, one, who sees what will be the consequences of certain principles, and, the effects of certain causes, may pass with the people, as hav∣ing the knowledge of <HI>prediction.</HI></P>

<HEAD>348. To <HI>Reprove, Reprimand.</HI></HEAD>
<P>He who <HI>reproves</HI> another, points out his fault, and, blames him. He who <HI>re∣primands,</HI> pretends to punish, and, morti∣fies the offender.</P>
<P>We <HI>reprove</HI> a friend. We <HI>reprimand</HI> a child.</P>
<P><HI>Reprove,</HI> is seldom used, but, with re∣spect to the faults of the mind; <HI>repri∣mand,</HI> with regard to the manners and con∣duct.</P>

<HEAD>349. <HI>Austere, Severe.</HI></HEAD>
<P>We are <HI>austere,</HI> by our manner of liv∣ing; <HI>severe,</HI> by our manner of thinking.</P>
<P>Softness, is the reverse of <HI>austerity;</HI> it is rare to pass, immediately, from one to the other; a common, regular way of life, is the medium, between the two. Re∣missness, and, <HI>severity,</HI> are the two ex∣tremes, in one of which, we are sure to fall; few persons being able to distinguish the true medium, which consists, in an exact and precise knowledge of the law.</P>
<P>We are <HI>austere,</HI> only, with respect to ourselves; but, we may be <HI>severe,</HI> as well with respect to others, as ourselves.</P>
<P>Enthusiasts give themselves up to the exercises of <HI>austerity;</HI> this was, also, once, the custom of recluses. Some casuists af∣fect to distinguish themselves by a <HI>severe</HI>
<PB N="181" REF="186"/>morality; extending it, even, 'till it loses sight of every degree of reason.</P>
<P>An <HI>austere</HI> life, consists in the privation of pleasures and conveniences; we, some∣times, embrace it through a taste of singu∣larity, and, would fain have it thought to proceed from a principle of religion. Mo∣rals, too <HI>severe,</HI> may equally, with morals too remiss, wound the regularity of man∣ners.</P>

<HEAD>350. <HI>Tempest, Storm.</HI></HEAD>
<P>By <HI>tempest,</HI> is understood, the utmost vio∣lence of the wind; by <HI>storm,</HI> a commotion of the elements.</P>
<P><HI>Tempests,</HI> are more dreadful at sea, than <HI>storms.</HI></P>
<P>We use the word <HI>storm,</HI> to denote any violence of weather; but, then, in order, to determine what weather we mean,
<PB N="182" REF="187"/>we are under a necessity of adding such other words to it, as shall express the idea, we want to convey. Thus, we say, a <HI>storm</HI> of wind; a <HI>storm</HI> of hail, &amp;c. but, the word <HI>tempest,</HI> is understood to be, neither more or less, than, as was said before, the ut∣most violence of the wind: should this excess of wind, be atttended with rain, thunder and lightning, it, then, becomes a <HI>storm.</HI></P>
<P>We, may, say, with propriety, a great <HI>storm;</HI> but a great <HI>tempest,</HI> would be ab∣surd.</P>
<P>Words cannot describe the distresses of seamen, when out, in <HI>tempestuous</HI> weather. <HI>Stormy</HI> weather, is, generally, succeeded by serene.</P>

<HEAD>351. To <HI>Appear, Seem.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I know not how much I may differ from the rest of my countrymen; but, the verb, <HI>appear,</HI> in my opinion, relates, more, to the eye; <HI>seem,</HI> more, to the imagination.</P>
<P>An object, always, <HI>appears</HI> less, the far∣ther it is off. Many things <HI>seem</HI> practica∣ble, which cannot be carried into execu∣tion.</P>

<HEAD>352. <HI>Fast, Hard.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The sense, in which these words are ac∣counted synonymous, is that of quick mo∣tion; but, <HI>fast,</HI> denotes quickness, without force; <HI>hard,</HI> quickness, with violence. Thus, to run, ride, or, rain <HI>fast,</HI> implies a quicker motion, than common; but, to run, ride, or, rain <HI>hard,</HI> some degree of force or violence.</P>
<P>With respect to work, <HI>fast,</HI> means expe∣ditiously; <HI>hard,</HI> laboriously. Thus, he, who works <HI>fast,</HI> will soon have done. He, who works <HI>hard,</HI> will soon be weary.</P>

<HEAD>353. <HI>Clock, Dial.</HI></HEAD>
<P>These are both time-pieces, with this difference, that the <HI>clock</HI> strikes; the <HI>dial,</HI> does not. 'Tis, for this reason, we call that plate, which determines time, by a shadow, in the sun, a sun-<HI>dial.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>clock,</HI> tells, the hour; the <HI>dial,</HI> shews, it.</P>

<DIV2 N="354" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>354. <HI>Every, All.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Though the word, <HI>every,</HI> is, more fre∣quently, made use of, by itself; it is, some∣times, connected with the word, ONE; es∣pecially, when used as synonymous to <HI>all.</HI>
<PB N="186" REF="191"/>As, <HI>all</HI> of us; <HI>every one</HI> of us. These ex∣pressions shew, that <HI>every,</HI> is, rather, parti∣cular, relating more to individuals; and, that <HI>all,</HI> is rather, general, relating to the whole; the word, ONE, being added to <HI>every,</HI> specifying that determination.</P>
<P><HI>Every,</HI> includes, always, in its idea, the word <HI>all;</HI> though <HI>all,</HI> does not, always, include the word <HI>every:</HI> that is, <HI>all,</HI> speaks in general, only; whereas, <HI>every,</HI> excepts none.</P>
<P><HI>Every</HI> man is, undoubtedly, bound to assist his neighbour. <HI>All</HI> men, are mer∣cenary.</P>
<P><HI>All,</HI> seems to me, to be the plural of <HI>every; every</HI> being, constantly, applied to the singular number; <HI>all,</HI> to the plural. Thus, we say, <HI>every</HI> man; <HI>every</HI> thing; <HI>every</HI> part, &amp;c. but, <HI>all</HI> men; <HI>all</HI> things; <HI>all</HI> parts, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>355. <HI>Pity, Compassion, Commiseration.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I cannot say, whether in the character∣ising of these words, I may fall in with the opinion of the public; but, with respect to the two first, <HI>pity,</HI> seems to me, to be, rather, particular, and, to be used, with most propriety, with regard to persons, we have some knowledge of; whereas, <HI>compassion,</HI> is more general, and, may be used, equally, with respect, to those we know, as, to those we know not.</P>
<P>We are said, to <HI>pity</HI> the distresses of a friend; and, <HI>compassionate</HI> the misfortunes of a stranger.</P>
<P><HI>Pity,</HI> seems most applicable to the first emotions we feel, at the sight or descrip∣tion of an object in distress; rising from tenderness of heart. <HI>Compassion,</HI> seems to
<PB N="188" REF="193"/>result from reflection, on the unmerited ca∣lamities of another; springing from the truest benevolence.</P>
<P>Thus, we say, it was through <HI>pity,</HI> we were led to <HI>compassionate</HI> his case.</P>
<P><HI>Commiseration,</HI> in my opinion, implies a fellow-feeling, or, the bearing a part in another's woe, and, rises from sympathy.</P>
<P>We, naturally, <HI>commiserate</HI> the sorrows of one, we love.</P>
<P>According to this interpretation of the words, we may <HI>pity,</HI> and, yet, not have <HI>compassion;</HI> we may have both <HI>pity,</HI> and, <HI>compassion,</HI> yet, not <HI>commiserate.</HI></P>
<P>The word <HI>pity,</HI> on some occasions, has been made use of, by way of contempt; as I <HI>pity</HI> her pride: but it seems hare, to be used, rather, ironically, than, to imply, in its real signification, any degree of scorn.</P>
</DIV2>

<PB N="189" REF="194"/>
<HEAD>356. <HI>Slippery, Glib.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Glibness,</HI> implies, a great degree of <HI>slipperi∣ness; slipperiness,</HI> a small degree of <HI>glibness.</HI></P>
<P>All ice is <HI>slippery;</HI> but, that, which is, remarkably, smooth, is <HI>glib.</HI></P>
<P>The proper, and, literal definition of <HI>slippery,</HI> is, affording no firm hold, or, footing; that of <HI>glib,</HI> made easy to be moved. In this sense, the first, denotes, something, natural; the last, something, not so.</P>
<P>An eel is so <HI>slippery,</HI> as to be difficult to hold. Wet weather, succeeded by a frost, makes the ways <HI>slippery.</HI> Oiling, the fly of a jack, makes it run <HI>glib.</HI></P>
<P>So, in the figurative sense; speaking of a woman, fond of gallantry; we say, she is a <HI>slippery</HI> dame. Nothing is of a more <HI>slippery</HI> nature, than true happiness; it slides
<PB N="190" REF="195"/>through the fingers, even, while we think, we hold it fast. Strong liquor, on different persons, has different effects; some, it sickens; others, it stupifies; of others, again, it makes the tongue run so <HI>glib,</HI> as to be, greatly, entertaining.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="357" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>357. <HI>Ridicule, Derision.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Laughter in scorn, is the common im∣port of these words; but, that of <HI>ridicule,</HI> implies, contemptuous merriment; that of <HI>derision,</HI> sportive insult.</P>
<P>We, <HI>ridicule,</HI> in order, to shew another his fault, and, induce him to amend: We never <HI>deride,</HI> but, with the utmost con∣tempt.</P>
<P>A friend will, often, <HI>ridicule;</HI> none, but an enemy, <HI>derides.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="196"/>If we have done any thing deserving <HI>ridicule,</HI> we should endeavour to retrieve our character, lest we become the <HI>derision</HI> of all who know us.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="358" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>358. To <HI>Cry, Weep.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Shedding of tears, is the general sense, in which these words are understood; but, to <HI>cry,</HI> implies, shedding of tears, audibly; to <HI>weep,</HI> shedding of tears, with silence.</P>
<P>Children, commonly, <HI>cry;</HI> grown per∣sons, generally, <HI>weep.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis not the noise we make, that denotes a greater or less measure of grief; for, the secret <HI>weeper,</HI> may be more distressed, than one, who <HI>crys,</HI> aloud.</P>
<P><HI>Crying</HI> is found, by experience, to give greater relief to sorrow, than, bare <HI>weep∣ing.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="359" TYPE="part">
<PB N="192" REF="197"/>
<HEAD>359. To <HI>Shake, Tremble.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Both these words imply, being agitated with a vibratory motion, but, as this mo∣tion seems to arise from different causes, it renders the choice of them, necessary.</P>
<P><HI>Shake,</HI> appears to me, more applicable to a tremulous motion, occasioned by cold; <HI>tremble,</HI> to a like motion, occasioned by fear.</P>
<P>We <HI>shake</HI> with cold; we <HI>tremble</HI> with fear.</P>
<P>When the blood is chilled, we, naturally, <HI>shake.</HI> The very thought of danger, will make the coward, <HI>tremble.</HI></P>
<P>The verb <HI>shake</HI> is often used in the ac∣tive sense; the verb <HI>tremble,</HI> never. Thus we <HI>shake</HI> the house; <HI>shake</HI> a tree; <HI>shake</HI> hands, &amp;c.</P>

<P><HI>Prebend,</HI> implies, a certain stipend, granted to the clergy, in cathedral churches: <HI>prebendary,</HI> denotes, properly, the person who receives that stipend. Though it is well known to every one, that, one of these words, implies, the stipend; the other, the stipendiary, yet I thought fit to take no∣tice of them, especially, as it gave me an opportunity of correcting their erroneous use; it being common, to employ the word, <HI>prebendary,</HI> to express, the benefice; and, that of <HI>prebend,</HI> to denote, the dignitary; whereas, they should be reversed; <HI>i. e. Prebend,</HI> should be used to mark the of∣fice: <HI>prebendary,</HI> to point out the person, filling that office.</P>

<HEAD>362. <HI>Discourse, Conversation.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The general import of these words, is, the mutual intercourse of speech, but, that of <HI>discourse,</HI> implies, serious or set talk, upon any particular subject; that of <HI>conversation,</HI> such, as is easy and familiar, and, not con∣fined to any particular topic.</P>
<P><HI>Discourse,</HI> is, generally, formal; <HI>conver∣sation,</HI> commonly, chearful.</P>
<P>The attention of men is so much scat∣tered, by dissipation, that, when together, exclusive of business, they seldom en∣ter into any <HI>discourse,</HI> that is improving: but, their general <HI>conversation</HI> runs on things, in their nature, trifling, and, impertinent.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="363" TYPE="part">
<PB N="196" REF="201"/>
<HEAD>363. <HI>Impertinent, Impudent, Saucy.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Nothing is more general than the indis∣criminate use of these words, though none differ more among themselves: if a man gives rude language, how common is it to say, he is an <HI>impertinent, impudent,</HI> or, <HI>saucy</HI> fellow. One would imagine their peculiar ideas, are so well known, as to render it unnecessary, to take farther notice of them; but, as some people never see the stum∣bling block till they fall over it, it may not be unnecessary to give them a perfect view of it: in order to which, I need, only, define them.</P>
<P><HI>Impertinent,</HI> then, means, intruding, and, meddling with what, no way concerns us. <HI>Impudent,</HI> implies, shamelessness, or, want of modesty. <HI>Saucy,</HI> means, insolent, and, abusive.</P>
<P>To shew a further difference between them, or, give any examples of their use, would be needless.</P>

<HEAD>364. <HI>Tongue, Language.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I know not whether in characterising these words, I may fall in with the taste of the public; but, according to my opinion, <HI>tongue,</HI> seems, to agree best with a corrupted <HI>language,</HI> that is, <HI>tongue,</HI> appears to be more particular, or, provincial; <HI>language,</HI> more general, or, national. Thus, I would say, the vulgar <HI>tongue;</HI> the mother <HI>tongue;</HI> the Yorkshire <HI>tongue;</HI> but, the English <HI>lan∣guage;</HI> the French <HI>language;</HI> the Spanish <HI>language.</HI></P>
<P>That, of the Indians, may be, rather, called a <HI>tongue,</HI> than a <HI>language;</HI> it being neither formal, or, regular.</P>
<P>The generality of people, content them∣selves, with speaking the <HI>tongue,</HI> common to the place they are bred up in; without paying any regard, to the beauties of their native <HI>language.</HI></P>

<HEAD>365. <HI>Fuddled, Drunk, Intoxicated.</HI></HEAD>
<P>With respect to the two first of these words, <HI>drunk,</HI> rises upon that of <HI>fuddled; fuddled,</HI> implying, a less degree of inebria∣tion; <HI>drunk,</HI> a greater. As to the word <HI>intoxicated,</HI> its greatest distinction is, that, whereas <HI>fuddled,</HI> and, <HI>drunk,</HI> are seldom used, in the figurative sense; that, is hardly ever, in the literal.</P>
<P>Half a pint of wine, will make some men, <HI>drunk;</HI> when others, shall drink a gallon, without being, the least, <HI>fuddled.</HI> Good success will, sometimes, so <HI>intoxicate</HI> a person, as to take him off from his busi∣ness, and, render him disagreeable to all his acquaintance.</P>

<HEAD>366. <HI>Bargain, Agreement, Contract.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Bargain,</HI> is more limited, relating to sale; <HI>agreement,</HI> and, <HI>contract,</HI> are more general, implying, any sort of stipulation; with this difference between them, that <HI>agreement,</HI> seems to denote, a verbal one; <HI>contract,</HI> one, that is written.</P>
<P>It is a mark of honesty, in dealing, never to draw back from a <HI>bargain,</HI> once made. Such is the unsteadiness of mankind, that we are, frequently, obliged to enter into <HI>contract,</HI> in order, to bind them to their <HI>agreement.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="367" TYPE="part">
<PB N="200" REF="205"/>
<HEAD>367. <HI>Mine, My own.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Though many are of opinion that, the the word, <HI>own,</HI> is added to the possessive pronoun, <HI>my,</HI> by way of emphasis, or, cor∣roboration, only; yet, custom seems to have thrown into the idea of the ex∣pression, <HI>my own,</HI> a greater degree of pro∣perty, than, into that, of the word, <HI>mine.</HI> Thus, a workman, to whom certain tools have been appropriated by his master, for the work he is imployed on, might, with propriety, say, these tools are <HI>mine,</HI> though, at the same time, they are not <HI>his own,</HI> be∣ing the property of his master. So, again, a wife, might lay claim to the cloaths she wears, and, say, they are <HI>mine;</HI> though, she could not say, with propriety, that, they were <HI>her own,</HI> being, in reality, the pro∣perty of her husband. On the other hand, the expression, <HI>my own,</HI> may, with elegance, be used, by the person, in whom the sole right of a thing, is vested.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="368" TYPE="part">
<PB N="201" REF="206"/>
<HEAD>368. <HI>Nigh, Near.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I will leave it to the decision of the curi∣ous, whether or no, the word <HI>near,</HI> is not a corruption of <HI>nigher,</HI> the comparative of <HI>nigh:</HI> be this as it may, <HI>near,</HI> in my opinion, implies, a less distance than <HI>nigh.</HI> Thus, I should say, when we come <HI>nigh</HI> to such a place, we shall be <HI>near</HI> home: the <HI>nigher</HI> the enemy, the <HI>nearer</HI> the danger. As a farther proof of this, speaking of the close tyes of kindred, we use the word <HI>near,</HI> in preference to that of <HI>nigh,</HI> as implying a less distance, or, greater degree of consangui∣nity, between the two persons. Thus, my brother's child is my <HI>near</HI> relation, or, is <HI>nearly</HI> related to me.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="369" TYPE="part">

<HEAD>369. <HI>Efficacious, Effectual.</HI></HEAD>
<P>With respect to these two words, that of <HI>efficacious,</HI> seems not so powerful, as that of <HI>effectual.</HI> The first, gets the better of most obstacles; the last, of all.</P>
<P>By an <HI>efficacious</HI> remedy, we put an <HI>effec∣tual</HI> stop.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="370" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>370. <HI>Width, Wideness.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Width,</HI> seem, more applicable to things small in themselves; <HI>wideness,</HI> to those, which are large. Thus, we say, the <HI>width</HI> of paper; the <HI>width</HI> of cloth; but, the <HI>wide∣ness</HI> of a ditch; the <HI>wideness</HI> of a field.</P>
