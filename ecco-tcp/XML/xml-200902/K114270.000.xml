<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is with the Writings of Mankind, in some Measure, as with their Complexi∣ons or their Dress, each Nation hath a Peculiarity in all these, to distinguish it from the rest of the World.</P>
<P>The Gravity of the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and the Levity of the <HI>Frenchman,</HI> are as evident in all their Productions as in their Per∣sons themselves; and the Stile of my Coun∣trymen is as naturally Strong and Nervous, as that of an <HI>Arabian</HI> or <HI>Persian</HI> is rich and figurative.</P>
<P>There is an Elegancy and Wildness of Thought which recommends all their Com∣positions; and our Genius's are as much too cold for the Entertainment of such Sen∣timents, as our Climate is for their Fruits and Spices. If any of these Beauties are to be found in the following <HI>Eclogues,</HI> I hope my Reader will consider them as an Argument of their being Original. I re∣ceived them at the Hands of a Merchant, who had made it his Business to enrich him∣self
<PB N="iv" REF="4"/>
with the Learning, as well as the Silks and Carpets of the <HI>Persians.</HI> The little Infor∣mation I could gather concerning their Au∣thor, was, That his Name was <HI>Mahamed,</HI> and that he was a Native of <HI>Tauris.</HI></P>
<P>It was in that City that he died of a Distemper fatal in those Parts, whilst he was engag'd in celebrating the Victories of his favourite Monarch, <HI>the Great Abbas.</HI> As to the <HI>Eclogues</HI> themselves, they give a very just View of the Miseries, and Incon∣veniencies, as well as the Felicities that at∣tend one of the finest Countries in the East.</P>
<P>The Time of the Writing them was pro∣bably in the Beginning of <HI>Sha Sultan Hos∣seyn</HI>'s Reign, the Successor of <HI>Sefi</HI> or <HI>Soly∣man</HI> the Second.</P>
<P>Whatever Defects, as, I doubt not, there will be many, fall under the Reader's Ob∣servation, I hope his Candour will incline him to make the following Reflections:</P>
<P>That the Works of <HI>Orientals</HI> contain many Peculiarities, and that thro' Defect of Language few <HI>European</HI> Translators can do them Justice.</P>

<STAGE>SCENE, a Valley near <HI>Bagdat.</HI></STAGE>
<STAGE>TIME, the MORNING.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>YE <HI>Persian</HI> Maids, attend your Poet's Lays,</L>
<L>And hear how Shepherds pass their golden Days:</L>
<L>Not all are blest, whom Fortune's Hand sustains</L>
<L>With Wealth in Courts, nor all that haunt the Plains:</L>
<L>Well may your Hearts believe the Truths I tell,</L>
<L>'Tis Virtue makes the Bliss, where'er we dwell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus <HI>Selim</HI> sung; by sacred Truth inspir'd;</L>
<L>No Praise the Youth, but her's alone desir'd:</L>
<L>Wise in himself, his meaning Songs convey'd</L>
<L>Informing Morals to the Shepherd Maid,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="6"/>
Or taught the Swains that surest Bliss to find,</L>
<L>What Groves nor Streams bestow, a virtuous Mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When sweet and od'rous, like an Eastern Bride,</L>
<L>The radiant Morn resum'd her orient Pride,</L>
<L>When wanton Gales, along the Valleys play,</L>
<L>Breathe on each Flow'r, and bear their Sweets away:</L>
<L>By <HI>Tigris'</HI> Wand'rer Waves he sate, and sung</L>
<L>This useful Lesson for the Fair and Young.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye <HI>Persian</HI> Dames, he said, to ye belong,</L>
<L>Well may they please, the Morals of my Song;</L>
<L>No fairer Maids, I trust, than ye are found,</L>
<L>Grac'd with soft Arts, the peopled World around!</L>
<L>The Morn that lights you, to your Loves supplies</L>
<L>Each gentler Ray delicious to your Eyes:</L>
<L>For ye those Flow'rs her fragrant Hands bestow,</L>
<L>And yours the Love that Kings delight to know.</L>
<L>Yet think not these, all beauteous as they are,</L>
<L>The best kind Blessings Heav'n can grant the Fair!</L>
<L>Who trust alone in Beauty's feeble Ray,</L>

Drawn from the Deep, they sparkle to the Sight,</L>
<L>And all-unconscious shoot a lust'rous Light:</L>
<L>Such are the Maids, and such the Charms they boast,</L>
<L>By Sense unaided, or to Virtue lost.</L>
<L>Self-flattering Sex! your Hearts believe in vain</L>
<L>That Love shall blind, when once he fires the Swain;</L>
<L>Or hope a Lover by your Faults to win,</L>
<L>As Spots on Ermin beautify the Skin:</L>
<L>Who seeks secure to rule, be first her Care</L>
<L>Each softer Virtue that adorns the Fair,</L>
<L>Each tender Passion Man delights to find,</L>
<L>The lov'd Perfections of a female Mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Blest were the Days, when Wisdom held her Reign,</L>
<L>And Shepherds sought her on the silent Plain,</L>
<L>With Truth she wedded in the secret Grove,</L>
<L>The fair-eyed Truth, and Daughters bless'd their Love.</L>
</LG>

<L>O haste, fair Maids, ye Virtues come away,</L>

<L>The Rose may then improve her Blush by Thee.</L>
<L>Here make thy Court amidst our rural Scene,</L>
<L>And Shepherd-Girls shall own Thee for their Queen.</L>
<L>With Thee be Chastity, of all afraid,</L>
<L>Distrusting all, a wise suspicious Maid;</L>
<L>But Man the most; not more the Mountain Doe</L>
<L>Holds the swift Falcon for her deadly Foe.</L>
<L>Cold is her Breast, like Flow'rs that drink the Dew,</L>
<L>A silken Veil conceals her from the View.</L>
<L>No wild Desires amidst thy Train be known,</L>
<L>But Faith, whose Heart is fix'd on one alone:</L>
<L>Desponding Meekness with her down-cast Eyes,</L>
<L>And friendly Pity full of tender Sighs;</L>
<L>And Love the last: By these your Hearts approve,</L>
<L>These are the Virtues that must lead to Love.</L>

<PB N="9" REF="9"/>
<L>Thus sung the Swain, and Eastern Legends say,</L>

<STAGE>SCENE, the Desart.</STAGE>
<STAGE>TIME, MID-DAY.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>IN silent Horror o'er the Desart-Waste</L>
<L>The Driver <HI>Hassan</HI> with his Camels past.</L>
<L>One Cruise of Water on his Back he bore,</L>
<L>And his light Scrip contain'd a scanty Store:</L>
<L>A Fan of painted Feathers in his Hand,</L>
<L>To guard his shaded Face from scorching Sand.</L>
<L>The sultry Sun had gain'd the middle Sky,</L>
<L>And not a Tree, and not an Herb was nigh.</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="11"/>
The Beasts, with Pain, their dusty Way pursue,</L>
<L>Shrill roar'd the Winds, and dreary was the View!</L>
<L>With desp'rate Sorrow wild th' affrighted Man</L>
<L>Thrice sigh'd, thrice strook his Breast, and thus began:</L>
<L><HI>Sad was the Hour, and luckless was the Day,</HI></L>
<L><HI>When first from</HI> Schiraz' <HI>Walls I bent my Way.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah! little thought I of the blasting Wind,</L>
<L>The Thirst or pinching Hunger that I find!</L>
<L>Bethink thee, <HI>Hassan,</HI> where shall Thirst assuage,</L>
<L>When fails this Cruise, his unrelenting Rage?</L>
<L>Soon shall this Scrip its precious Load resign,</L>
<L>Then what but Tears and Hunger shall be thine?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye mute Companions of my Toils, that bear</L>
<L>In all my Griefs a more than equal Share!</L>
<L>Here, where no Springs, in Murmurs break away,</L>
<L>Or Moss-crown'd Fountains mitigate the Day:</L>
<L>In vain ye hope the green Delights to know,</L>
<L>Which Plains more blest, or verdant Vales bestow,</L>
<L>Here Rocks alone, and tasteless Sands are found,</L>
<L>And faint and sickly Winds for ever howl around.</L>
<L><HI>Sad was the Hour,</HI> &amp;c.</L>

<L>Curst be the Gold and Silver which persuade</L>
<L>Weak Men to follow far-fatiguing Trade.</L>
<L>The Lilly-Peace outshines the silver Store,</L>
<L>And Life is dearer than the golden Ore.</L>
<L>Yet Money tempts us o'er the Desart brown,</L>
<L>To ev'ry distant Mart, and wealthy Town:</L>
<L>Full oft we tempt the Land, and oft the Sea,</L>
<L>And are we only yet repay'd by Thee?</L>
<L>Ah! why was Ruin so attractive made,</L>
<L>Or why fond Man so easily betray'd?</L>
<L>Why heed we not, whilst mad we haste along,</L>
<L>The gentle Voice of Peace, or Pleasure's Song?</L>
<L>Or wherefore think the flow'ry Mountain's Side,</L>
<L>The Fountain's Murmurs, and the Valley's Pride,</L>
<L>Why think we these less pleasing to behold,</L>
<L>Than dreary Desarts, if they lead to Gold?</L>
<L><HI>Sad was the Hour,</HI> &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O cease, my Fears! all frantic as I go,</L>
<L>When Thought creates unnumber'd Scenes of Woe,</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="13"/>
What if the Lion in his Rage I meet!</L>
<L>Oft in the Dust I view his printed Feet:</L>
<L>And fearful! oft, when Day's declining Light</L>
<L>Yields her pale Empire to the Mourner Night,</L>
<L>By Hunger rous'd, he scours the groaning Plain,</L>
<L>Gaunt Wolves and sullen Tygers in his Train:</L>
<L>Before them Death with Shrieks directs their Way,</L>
<L>Fills the wild Yell, and leads them to their Prey.</L>
<L><HI>Sad was the Hour, &amp;c.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At that dead Hour the silent Asp shall creep,</L>
<L>If ought of rest I find, upon my Sleep:</L>
<L>Or some swoln Serpent twist his Scales around,</L>
<L>And wake to Anguish with a burning Wound.</L>
<L>Thrice happy they, the wise contented Poor,</L>
<L>From Lust of Wealth, and Dread of Death secure;</L>
<L>They tempt no Desarts, and no Griefs they find;</L>
<L>Peace rules the Day, where Reason rules the Mind.</L>
<L><HI>Sad was the Hour, &amp;c.</HI></L>

<L>O hapless Youth! for she thy Love hath won,</L>
<L>The tender <HI>Zara,</HI> will be most undone!</L>

Big swell'd my Heart, and own'd the pow'rful Maid,</L>
<L>When fast she dropt her Tears, as thus she said;</L>
<L>" Farewel the Youth whom Sighs could not detain,</L>
