<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>Indeed (said <HI>Lucid</HI>) I have often heard</L>

<BIBL>Spenser's Colin Clout's come home again.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<LG>
<L>YET once again, by wayward fortune led,</L>
<L>I view the sacred walls where dwelt my fair;</L>
<L>Where, blest with her, my days in rapture fled;</L>
<L>Too soon alloy'd, and shaded with despair!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
<L>Three years are past, since first my yielding heart</L>
<L>It's virgin vows to love and <HI>Delia</HI> paid;</L>
<L>(Sincere itself, it ne'er suspected art!)</L>
<L>And ah! what changes those three years have made!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Young <HI>Corydon,</HI> to whom the fair one gave</L>
<L>Her earliest faith, and holiest union vow'd,</L>
<L>Sleeps in the silent chamber of the grave,</L>
<L>And for a wedding garment wears a shroud.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Large tides of grief in <HI>Delia</HI>'s bosom roll'd:</L>
<L>But soon <HI>Dametas</HI> dried the mourner's tears;</L>
<L><HI>Dametas,</HI> rich, but petulant and old,</L>
<L>And damn'd with jealousy, the crime of years.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What need I more—by treach'rous friends deceiv'd,</L>
<L>He mark'd each venial fault with jaundic'd eyes,</L>
<L>Each paltry tale with partial ear believ'd,</L>
<L>And construed Indiscretion into Vice.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now, banish'd from a husband's board, she mourns;</L>
<L>Her woes embitter'd by a parent's frown;</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="5"/>Condemn'd, rejected, for a crime she scorns;</L>
<L>And like a dream her transient glories flown.</L>

<LG>
<L>Fair daughter of the morn, thy star is set!</L>
<L>Thy star is set, nor ever more must rise!</L>
<L>O may no wrongs of mine, in judgment met,</L>
<L>Swell thy full soul's distress with added cries!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>We might have liv'd!—Ah sadly pleasing thought!</L>
<L>Vain Recollection! What art thou to me!</L>
<L>We might have liv'd! As virtuous love had taught,</L>
<L>In unreproved pleasures ever free.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>We might have liv'd!—But execrable gold</L>
<L>Love's unsubstantial claims and tears outweigh'd:</L>
<L>For wealth her charms the venal <HI>Delia</HI> sold,</L>
<L>For wealth her lover and her friend betray'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For me, (who now with pain review the place</L>
<L>Where once my <HI>Delia</HI> call'd her <HI>Colin</HI> dear;</L>
<L>Each well-known path with aching heart retrace,</L>
<L>Think on her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ickleness and drop a tear:)</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
<L>Silent and sole, I seek th' accustom'd bow'r,</L>
<L>The Bow'r once sacred to my love and me;</L>
<L>Where oft with her I pass'd th' enraptur'd hour,</L>
<L>And bore the syren charmer on my knee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I seek the Plane, whose trunk, with mine combin'd</L>
<L>Bears the dear letters of my <HI>Delia</HI>'s name;</L>
<L>I mark their growth, but that distracts my mind,</L>
<L>For such I once had hop'd our mutual flame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>E'en while I write, these scenes of former bliss</L>
<L>Such fond reflections in my bosom move,</L>
<L>What then my fortune was, what now it is,</L>
<L>That though I can't esteem, I still must love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I love; but 'tis not with that youthful heat</L>
<L>Which once inflam'd my soul, to reason blind;</L>
<L>'Tis with that soothing grief, that soft regret,</L>
<L>Which those who think on friends departed, find.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I grieve; but 'tis a calm and virtuous woe,</L>
<L>By reason sanctified, by heav'n approv'd;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="7"/>'Tis such as kindred saints in heaven might know,</L>
<L>Seeing those fall whom when on earth they lov'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Time and reflection long have chas'd away</L>
<L>The painted phantoms that bewitch'd my sight;</L>
<L>God's wise behests submissive I obey,</L>
<L>And own, convinc'd, "Whatever is, is right."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Vain love, farewell!—for me, should heav'n design</L>
<L>Such added blessing to my future life;</L>
<L>Soon may I call th' ingenuous <HI>Mira</HI> mine,</L>
<L>And meet, unwarpt by love, a virtuous wife.</L>

<L>MY friends, no more!—your kind remon∣strance spare!</L>
<L>Your kind remonstrance, your advice is vain:</L>

<L>It serves no purpose but to give me pain.</L>

<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
<L>I cannot feel one wish for pomp or pow'r,</L>
<L>I seek no titles, I desire no place;</L>
<L>Born as I was in unambitious hour</L>
<L>I scorn the prize, and can I run the race?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Westminster Hall.</NOTE> in <HI>the Courts</HI> I take my silent stand,</L>
<L>Unenvious I behold the judge's state;</L>
<L>Behold with pitying eye, Law's restless band,</L>

<L>Onward I pass—A soberer scene succeeds:</L>
<L><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Westminster Abbey.</NOTE>'Tis the sad mansion of departed kings!</L>
<L>Where every stone that blazons forth their deeds</L>
<L>Proclaims the vanity of earthly things.</L>

<L>Proclaims th' aspiring croud I left behind,</L>
<L>Mere insect swarms that shine but for an hour;</L>
<L>Then, nipt by cold or shatter'd by the wind,</L>
<L>Fleet, like the transient bow that gilds a show'r.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
<L>Shall I then sacrifice life's happiest prime</L>
<L>To gain employments I should wish to shun?</L>
<L>Enslave the sacred freedom of my time</L>
<L>To win a title I should hate when won?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No!—Let me live with independence blest,</L>
<L>Blest with the sweets of no unlearned ease;</L>
<L>Indulge th' unruffl'd calm my soul loves best,</L>
<L>And eat my bread in privacy and peace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>One sole inducement could have rous'd my mind;</L>
<L>That sole inducement has been long no more:</L>
<L><HI>Delia</HI> was false!—with her at once resign'd</L>
<L>Fled all the schemes I ever form'd for pow'r.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Had she been mine, what could not I have done</L>
<L>To give that wealth she now has bought so dear?</L>
<L>What prize so great that I could not have won,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
<L>Now for myself I live:—With books my morn,</L>
<L>With friends perchance my evening hours are spent:</L>
<L>The rich man's wonder, and the proud man's scorn,</L>
<L>I envy neither, for I feel content.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Free, unconstrain'd, my country's laws I choose;</L>
<L>Those laws by which e'en monarchs are control'd;</L>
<L>Their changes trace, their origin deduce;</L>
<L>But do it for instruction, not for gold.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus let me live, till manhood's steadier day</L>
<L>Matures the seeds that lab'ring youth has sown:</L>
<L>Then might some fav'ring female, chastly gay,</L>
<L>Wise without pride, and fair without a frown:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Would such a one, from mean coquetry free,</L>
<L>Who held her word as sacred as her fame:</L>

<L>Blest beyond hope, how gladly I'd forswear</L>

<L>Blest too is he, whom woods and streams can charm,</L>

<L>Who tunes, (his heart with thankful rapture warm,)</L>
<L>To Nature's bounteous lord the rural lyre.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
<L>No toil of office ruffles his repose,</L>

<L>Unvers'd in publick scenes, he little knows</L>
<L>The loud discordant senate's vain debate.</L>

<L>He little knows th' embattled pow'rs that join</L>
<L>From <HI>Britain's</HI> grasp her western world to rend;</L>
<L>Nor sees her sick'ning Genius droop and pine,</L>
<L>Nor deems her less'ning glories near their end.</L>

<L>Untost by storms, he gently glides through life;</L>

<Q><L>On the green bank I sat, and listen'd long</L>
<L>(Sitting was more convenient for the song:)</L>
<L>Nor till her lay was ended could I move,</L>
<L>But wish'd to dwell for ever in the grove.</L>
<L>Only methought the time too swiftly pass'd,</L>
<L>And every note I fear'd would be the last.</L>
<L>My sight, and smell, and hearing, were employ'd,</L>
<L>And all three senses in full gust enjoy'd.</L>
<L>And what alone did all the rest surpass,</L>
<L>The sweet possession of the fairy place;</L>
<L>Single, and conscious to myself alone</L>
<L>Of pleasures to th' excluded world unknown:</L>
<L>Pleasures which no where else were to be found,</L>
<L>And all Elysium in a spot of ground.</L>

<L>Again the summer shines! with mightier flame</L>
<L>The Sun exults his lengthen'd course to roll,</L>
<L>And wide diffuses through the human frame</L>
<L>A languid bliss that melts the poet's soul.</L>

<L>It melts the soul, but gives the pow'r to sing</L>

<L>Great Life of all the world, and Lord of day!</L>
<L>Best symbol of our common Maker's might!</L>
<L>Well might th' unguided heathen thee obey,</L>
<L>And prostrate hail thy orb's returning light;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For oft myself have felt thy rapt'rous heat</L>
<L>Steal o'er my senses like a fairy dream;</L>
<L>Then, when my yielding limbs have sought retreat,</L>
<L>And sunk in silence near some shaded stream;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My soul, on Fancy's wing sublimely borne,</L>
<L>Hath mus'd of scenes too bright for mortal eye;</L>
<L>Hath seen white robes by saints and martyrs worn,</L>
