After the offering to Diana, a dance of female Trojans takes place, which is interrupted by the arrival of a messenger from Cassandra, who wishes to come from her place of confinement <HI>(detained there as a lunatic)</HI> to expound a prophecy. Paris, after some deliberation, complies with the request: the messenger retires, and, soon after, returns with Cassandra, who deplores her situation, in consequence of being treated as one deranged in mind: she informs Paris of the approaching danger of Troy. Paris, the Priests, Priestesses, &amp;c. shew every mark of disbelief, which enrages, Cas∣sandra, who, seizing her wand from her attend∣ant, invokes the Gods: informs Paris that she has the power to perform a miracle, and deter∣mines that instant to put it to the test, then leave him to judge of the truth of her prophecy. Cassandra strikes the figures of the Gods, which change from gold to black marble.</P>
<P>Paris and the rest are seized with horror! The actions displayed by the various groups, expressive of fear, hope, and revenge, forms the most lively and interesting picture of the various passions that agitate the human breast, which it is possible to convey through the medium of scenic effect.</P>

<P>PERHAPS no subject ever afforded a greater scope for the painter's pencil, or the inge∣nuity of the machinist, in point of stage-effect, than the Famous SIEGE of TROY; nor has the composer had a less field for his musical abilities. It will be seen, that the performers in general have each their share of business in this splendid and heroic spec∣tacle, and are not wanting in pantomimic action, to convey a proper idea of the nature of the siege, as well as the credulity of the besieged, in admitting within their walls the grand Trojan War Horse, which con∣tained five hundred Grecian soldiers, properly equipped for battle, &amp;c. within its body.</P>
<P>☞ The pantomime will be given every evening till further notice.</P>
