<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Author of these Fables flat∣ters himself that the Principles of a steadfast Loyalty, imbided in his ear∣liest days, from the example and instruc∣tion of a Father, who had the Honour to serve your ROYAL HIGHNESS'S illustrious Ancestors near fifty years in a Military station; Principles ripened and established by a conviction that the Pub∣lic
<PB REF="3"/>
welfare depends on the increase and prosperity of the August House of BRUNSWIC; may claim some indulgence for the many imperfections of a compo∣sition which he thus presumes to lay at your ROYAL HIGHNESS'S Feet.</P>
<P>If a laudable desire to sow the seeds of moral Truth; if an ardent zeal for our <HI>civil</HI> and <HI>religious</HI> LIBERTIES; if a sincere attachment to his MAJESTY'S person; whose mild Government pre∣serves to us those invaluable blessings; whose paternal care and bright example afford us the happy prospect of their being transmitted to latest posterity—if motives such as these, shall appear to
<PB REF="4"/>
have warmed the Author's breast and guided his Pen, in the course of this pro∣duction; it will greatly flatter his Honest Pride, whose ambition it is to approve, and to have the Honour of subscribing himself, with unfeigned zeal and hu∣mility,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your ROYAL HIGHNESS'S most devoted and most obedient servant, FRANCIS GENTLEMAN.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>FABLE I. VIRTUE AND FAME.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>SOME ages since, it so fell out,</L>
<L>That meeting at OLYMPIC rout;</L>
<L>(For goddesses have had their day,</L>
<L>To be as modern ladies gay;)</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="8"/>
Two females, mostly known by name,</L>
<L>One VIRTUE call'd—the other FAME,</L>
<L>Disputed who should lead, or follow,</L>
<L>Into the presence of APOLLO.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The matter, after verbal fight,</L>
<L>Was brought before the God of light;</L>
<L>When FAME, remark'd for nimble tongue,</L>
<L>Addressing first, complain'd of wrong.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Shall I, declaim'd the winged fair,</L>
<L>Who boast such eyes, so fine an air;</L>
<L>With almost ev'ry beauty grac'd,</L>
<L>Be thus in competition plac'd,</L>
<L>With such a formal, homely creature,</L>
<L>Without one fashionable feature?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Shall I, to whom the <HI>Great</HI> resort,</L>
<L>Whom <HI>Monarchs</HI> have been proud to court,</L>
<L>Provoking fate, midst War's alarms,</L>
<L>To gain possession of my charms;</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="9"/>
Precedence yield to one so mean,</L>
<L>Amongst the <HI>great</HI> so seldom seen?</L>
<L>Whom rustic <HI>cots</HI> can better please,</L>
<L>Than dear, inchanting <HI>palaces?</HI></L>
<L>The very thought is fill'd with shame,</L>
<L>And judgment gives in right of FAME.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She paus'd—APOLLO then desir'd</L>
<L>Such answer as the cause requir'd;</L>
<L>Which VIRTUE thus, with modest grace,</L>
<L>An easy shape, and cherub face,</L>
<L>Declar'd before the court in brief,</L>
<L>Thence justly claiming fit relief.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This girlish female, God of day,</L>
<L>To knaves and fools a frequent prey,</L>
<L>Of high connections boasts in vain,</L>
<L>Light phantoms of her idle brain:</L>
<L>Greatness you'll own—without my care,</L>
<L>A baseless castle in the air;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="10"/>
And rural <HI>cots,</HI> where I resort,</L>
<L>Much nobler than a vicious <HI>court.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis true, she posts the world around,</L>
<L>And fills it with a mighty sound;</L>
<L>O'er mankind rules in various spheres,</L>
<L>And leads them captive by the ears;</L>
<L>Yet what of this, when oft she flies</L>
<L>To propagate the grossest lies,</L>
<L>And wounds, in blackest guilt's defence,</L>
<L>The cause of spotless innocence?</L>
<L>Here then let ill tim'd diff'rence end,</L>
<L>On worth and justice I depend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The judge who heard with much respect,</L>
<L>His sentence pass'd to this effect;</L>
<L>Spoke all his thoughts, without disguise,</L>
<L>Th' impartial CAMDEN of the skies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>VIRTUE no doubt may justly claim</L>
<L>Precedence from contending FAME;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="11"/>
Tho' monumental falshoods pass</L>
<L>With fools, because engrav'd on brass:</L>
<L>Tho' villains of gigantic size,</L>
<L>In marble statues vainly rise:</L>
<L>Tho' titles, coronets, and state,</L>
<L>Like gew-gaws, deck th' unworthy <HI>great:</HI></L>
<L>Tho' venal authors gild a name,</L>
<L>Which sacred truth would brand with shame:</L>
<L>A cheated people's loud huzzas,</L>
<L>With all the farce of earthly praise;</L>
<L>By VIRTUE unsupported fail,</L>
<L>And vanish, like the passing gale.</L>
<L>Then, madam FAME, deceitful beauty,</L>
<L>'Tis fit that you confess your duty;</L>
<L>For, tho' exalted by a throne,</L>
<L>You cannot long exist alone;</L>
<L>Virtue, observe, I recommend,</L>
<L>As kindest parent, truest friend:</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="12"/>
Beneath whose just, and gentle sway,</L>
<L>You'll live 'till time itself decay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I look into the womb of time,</L>
<L>And view a yet unnotic'd clime;</L>
<L>By Neptune's azure flood enclos'd,</L>
<L>Where harrass'd freedom safe repos'd,</L>
<L>Shall gain you with a gracious smile,</L>
<L>To live as friends in BRITAIN'S isle;</L>
<L>To beam your lustre round her throne,</L>
<L>And mark her monarch all your own.</L>

<HEAD>FABLE II. THE NILE AND THE SEA.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>LIFE a dependant chain appears,</L>
<L>With links to join its sev'ral spheres;</L>
<L>Shew judging reason when you will,</L>
<L>One plac'd on high, there's higher still;</L>
<L>'Till strain'd progression mounts the sky,</L>
<L>And melts in vast infinity.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Pride, like a prism, such tints reveals</L>
<L>As Wisdom's naked eye conceals;</L>
<L>How idly vain then mortal man,</L>
<L>Whose fleeting life is but a span,</L>
<L>Tho' rais'd on Fortune's boldest wing,</L>
<L>A rich, a brave, a happy king,</L>
<L>Who thinks, with self-sufficient spirit,</L>
<L>All centers in his boundless merit;</L>
<L>Who, void of gratitude and sense,</L>
<L>Disclaims parental PROVIDENCE;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="14"/>
Whence all above, and all below,</L>
<L>Wealth, happiness, and courage flow?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The king of rivers, sev'n-mouth NILE,</L>
<L>Which yearly floods the neighbouring soil;</L>
<L>Which loads with grain the teeming earth,</L>
<L>And gives a thousand harvests birth—</L>
<L>Once, like a human Coxcomb, thought</L>
<L>His pow'r, alone, those blessings wrought—</L>
<L>What is, he cried, the thirsty Sea</L>
<L>In competition set with me?</L>
<L>My springs, my streams support its tide,</L>
<L>Whose mighty gulph must, unsupplied,</L>
<L>Turn to a wild, and barren shore;</L>
<L>The boasting watry world no more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To scatter blessings round, I reign,</L>
<L>And fertilize a vast domain;</L>
<L>Which wisely annual homage pays,</L>
<L>In fit returns of grateful praise;</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="15"/>
While yonder congregated flood</L>
<L>Does none, or very little good—</L>
<L>And yet its haughty billows rise,</L>
<L>As if to brave th' unheeding skies.</L>
<L>What <HI>stoic</HI> here could check a smile,</L>
<L>To hear the SEA compar'd with NILE?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The self-sufficient river spoke,</L>
<L>In sounds, like clouds of thunder broke,</L>
<L>'Till ev'n its CROCODILES began</L>
<L>To vie with huge LEVIATHAN;</L>
<L>And thought they must in reason be</L>
<L>Of greater size and quality.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Old OCEAN heard, and tho' disdain</L>
<L>Had best repaid a speech so vain;</L>
<L>He chose, with condescension mild,</L>
<L>Thus to rebuke his eldest child.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Restrain, presuming brook, thy pride;</L>
<L>Though thou, and all thy springs, were dry'd,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="16"/>
Thy petty tribute hardly miss'd,</L>
<L>In glory I should still exist.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Who gives the SUN'S exhaling beams</L>
<L>The moisture to supply thy streams?</L>
<L>Who gives the fleecy clouds their rain,</L>
<L>To sprinkle thirsty earth again?</L>
<L>Thou but return'st what I have lent,</L>
<L>To form a fruitful continent.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Rais'd in thy own opinion high,</L>
<L>Thou think'st not, that beyond the sky</L>
<L>There dwells a Pow'r, a gen'ral source,</L>
<L>Who gave the elements their course;</L>
<L>Who gave the lower world its birth,</L>
<L>Of water framing it, and earth;</L>
<L>Who fix'd to each the proper bound,</L>
<L>And mantled them with Aether round;</L>
<L>Who mark'd the glorious Sun his way,</L>
<L>Who bid it shine, and give the day;</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="17"/>
Who spangled o'er with gems of light,</L>
<L>The mild <HI>cerulean</HI> robe of night;</L>
<L>Who gave, in his omnipotence,</L>
<L>To beasts their strength, to man his sense;</L>
<L>Who cloath'd the birds with plumed grace,</L>
<L>Who fishes form'd a scaly race;</L>
<L>Who fix'd the seasons varying round,</L>
<L>With diff'rent fruits, and emblems crown'd;</L>
<L>The eye-enliv'ning, pregnant Spring,</L>
<L>With vegetation on its wing;</L>
<L>The bridegroom Summer deck'd with flow'rs,</L>
<L>And blooming Nature's strongest pow'rs;</L>
<L>Autumn in golden honours clad,</L>
<L>The peasant's humble hopes to glad;</L>
<L>Hoar Winter, with its chilly train</L>
<L>Of earth-refreshing frosts and rain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis PROVIDENCE which all bestows;</L>
<L>No atom self-existent grows;</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="18"/>
'Twas PROVIDENCE created me,</L>
<L>And hence was form'd a source for thee;</L>
<L>'Tis PROVIDENCE that gives again</L>
<L>Thy borrow'd waters to the main;</L>
<L>'Tis PROVIDENCE suspends them high,</L>
<L>Condens'd in clouds 'twixt earth and sky;</L>
<L>'Tis PROVIDENCE, with boundless pow'rs,</L>
<L>That melts them to propitious show'rs;</L>
<L>From PROVIDENCE all blessings flow,</L>
<L>Which animated beings know;</L>
<L>'Tis PROVIDENCE which reigns thro' all;</L>
<L>Which guides, and shields this earthly ball.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Content with thy exalted state,</L>
<L>Learn wisdom—and be truly great—</L>
<L>Remember, thy majestic flood</L>
<L>Th' ETERNAL gave for others good;</L>
<L>Not for thyself alone design'd,</L>
<L>But to enrich and bless mankind.—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="13" REF="19"/>
<L>Perform, on Nature's stage, thy part,</L>
<L>Well satisfied with what thou art;</L>
<L>Wisely support thy rank and spirit,</L>
<L>By aiming at superior merit;</L>
<L>Nor, vainly seeking higher stile,</L>
<L>In claiming more, be less than NILE;</L>
<L>Like human fools who with such care</L>
<L>Build baseless castles in the air;</L>
<L>Which rise at magic Folly's call,</L>
<L>And with the breath of Reason fall.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus venerable OCEAN said—</L>
<L>And sunk beneath the waves his head.</L>

<PB N="14" REF="20"/>
<HEAD>FABLE III. THE JUST LION.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>A FOX impell'd by hunger's cries,</L>
<L>Had made a LAMB his sacrifice,</L>
<L>When just as ev'ry thing was fit,</L>
<L>To revel on his dainty bit,</L>
<L>A lordly PANTHER, passing by,</L>
<L>Beheld it with voracious eye;</L>
<L>And, being nobly born, of course</L>
<L>The FOX'S dinner seiz'd by force,</L>
<L>With this remark—Tho' peasants starve,</L>
<L>PEERS, as they please, should always CARVE.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>REYNARD, thro' fear must needs obey,</L>
<L>So lick'd his chaps, and slunk away;</L>
<L>Yet still tho' not in body strong,</L>
<L>His feeling heart would bear no wrong;</L>
<L>To LEO'S court with speed he flew,</L>
<L>There standing in the Monarch's view,</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="21"/>
Stated at full th' oppressive case,</L>
<L>With simple truth, and piteous face;</L>
<L>Concluding thus,—My Prince, I know,</L>
<L>Will most impartial justice show;</L>
<L>Wherefore, to his decision, I</L>
<L>Submit my life, and property;</L>
<L>The weak, the nameless, and the poor,</L>
<L>Where VIRTUE reigns, must be secure.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The LION heard with honest wonder,</L>
<L>And cried, If I permit such plunder,</L>
<L>The monarchy of BEASTS will then</L>
<L>Degen'rate into that of MEN—</L>
<L>But other views shall guide my sway,</L>
<L>And ev'ry rank our laws obey.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Summon LORD PANTHER—straight he came—</L>
<L>And boldly answer'd to his name;</L>
<L>Confess'd the injur'd FOX'S charge,</L>
<L>In all its sev'ral points at large;</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="22"/>
Yet, confidently, seem'd to think,</L>
<L>That vulgar creature's meat and drink</L>
<L>Should to indulge his want or whim,</L>
<L>Just as he chose, belong to HIM.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>You know, my LIEGE, continues he,</L>
<L>I'm one of noble progeny,—</L>
<L>Who, if occasion urg'd me, could</L>
<L>Alliance prove to <HI>Royal</HI> blood—</L>
<L>Shall paltry REYNARD dare complain,</L>
<L>Nor meet, as sure he ought, disdain?</L>
<L><HI>Titles</HI> and <HI>rank</HI> are my defence,</L>
<L>But what can save his <HI>insolence?</HI></L>
<L>For my own part, I am content</L>
<L>His crime should be his punishment;</L>
<L>Then let him, gracious LIEGE, I pray,</L>
<L>This once go unchastis'd away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The LION, worthy of his place,</L>
<L>With sparkling eye, and awful grace,</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="23"/>
Spoke thus, and bade his court attend—</L>
<L>This PANTHER, once my valu'd friend,</L>
<L>Convicted, thus, of proud oppression,</L>
<L>By evidence, and self-confession,</L>
<L>Howe'er he thinks the action light,</L>
<L>I banish from my heart, and sight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Shall Noble Birth from justice save,</L>
<L>Shall titles serve to screen a Knave?</L>
<L>Shall Subjects be afraid to speak,</L>
<L>And shall the strong devour the weak?</L>
<L>The chain of prudent order broke,</L>
<L>Authority becomes a joke;</L>
<L>And thus applied, howe'er sublime,</L>
<L>PRE-EMINENCE becomes a CRIME.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>It never shall, my friends, be said,</L>
<L>When dust entombs this Royal Head,</L>
<L>To stain our Name, in future years,</L>
<L>That LEO shelter'd lawless PEERS—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="18" REF="24"/>
<L>Subjects, observe what I decide,</L>
<L>To shame, and sting dishonest pride;</L>
<L>This PANTHER on the FOX shall wait</L>
<L>Six tedious months, in servile state;</L>
<L>And when occasion gives the charge,</L>
<L>Still watch for prey, or hunt at large;</L>
<L>But ne'er presume to taste a bit,</L>
<L>'Till REYNARD graciously thinks fit.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SELF-KNOWLEDGE thus a friend may be,</L>
<L>And blunt the edge of TYRANNY;</L>
<L>May teach him, that the lordly part</L>
<L>Is seated in a noble heart;</L>
<L>Which rather would itself endure</L>
<L>Some pangs of WANT, than rob the POOR.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If e'er, to shame our laws, and sense,</L>
<L>I meet again such violence,</L>
<L>Justice shall doom severer fate,</L>
<L>To punish the licentious great;</L>
<L>Nor will I, mark me, Subjects, own</L>
<L>Ought noble, but the Good alone.</L>

<HEAD>FABLE IV. THE MOUNTAIN AND CLOUD.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>A Mountain, which might justly vie</L>
<L>With ATLAS to support the sky,</L>
<L>For ages had, with boundless pride,</L>
<L>O'erlook'd the plains on either side;</L>
<L>And thought, from his prodigious birth,</L>
<L>He ought to rule their humbler earth;</L>
<L>Tho' grac'd with corn, and fruit, and flocks,</L>
<L>In contrast to his barren rocks,</L>
<L>On which, instead of ought that grows,</L>
<L>Hung tempests dark, and endless snows.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>One sullen care—his folly's doom—</L>
<L>Still rankled in his flinty womb:</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="26"/>
That while the radiant source of day,</L>
<L>Beam'd o'er the vales with kindly ray,</L>
<L>An envious cloud, eclipsing light,</L>
<L>Wrapp'd his majestic head in night.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Impatient of suppos'd disgrace,</L>
<L>And fond to show his hideous face,</L>
<L>Like some amongst the human kind,</L>
<L>To all their grossest failings blind,</L>
<L>Who self-sufficiently reveal</L>
<L>What prudence wisely would conceal;</L>
<L>He thunder'd forth his plaint aloud</L>
<L>Against the dark impending cloud.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How long, foul vapour, wilt thou dare</L>
<L>To shroud my brows, and taint my air?</L>
<L>Shall I, who raging tempests sconr,</L>
<L>Tho' on the wings of light'ning borne;</L>
<L>Shall I, whose strength can never fail,</L>
<L>Tho' ev'n a deluge should assail,</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="27"/>
Be thus obscur'd?—vile cloud, away!</L>
<L>And give me to the eye of day.</L>
<L>Stung with this insolent address</L>
<L>The CLOUD replied—I must confess,</L>
<L>Gigantic neighbour, what you speak,</L>
<L>Declares that you, tho' great, are weak;</L>
<L>What worth or beauty canst thou show,</L>
<L>That's equal to the plains below?</L>
<L>What lab'ring oxen till thy soil?</L>
<L>What harvests pay the peasants toil?</L>
<L>What fruits, what herbage grace thy sides?</L>
<L>What useful river o'er thee glides?</L>
<L>What forests nod upon thy brows,</L>
<L>Ne'er ruffled by industrious ploughs?</L>
<L>Why, steril mass of rugged stone,</L>
<L>With skin of thriftless moss o'ergrown,</L>
<L>Shouldst thou proclaim thy giant size,</L>
<L>As if from thence desert could rise,</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="28"/>
Or make objections to my shade,</L>
<L>Suspended o'er thy tow'ring head,</L>
<L>Without reflecting 'tis the fate</L>
<L>Attending on superior state,</L>
<L>To have or me, or some such other,</L>
<L>Perhaps a tempest-breeding brother,</L>
<L>Around by way of caution glide,</L>
<L>To check the swell of monst'rous pride?</L>
<L>While humble, and contented plains,</L>
<L>An emblem of their village swains,</L>
<L>With justice claim, in being less,</L>
<L>A larger share of happiness</L>
<L>In their obscure, un-envied station,</L>
<L>Than in thy cloud topt exaltation;</L>
<L>Which, 'spite of all the strength you boast,</L>
<L>In sudden ruin may be lost.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus spake the CLOUD, as if inspir'd,</L>
<L>And with a passing gale retir'd;</L>

<L>Descended from the bird of JOVE,</L>

<L>The progress of his royal race;</L>
<L>Diminish'd fame, and weaken'd sway,</L>

That ev'ry night the Eagle's dreams</L>

<L>His sceptre broke, his throne o'erturn'd,</L>

<L>Began to entertain some doubt;</L>
<L>Whether his friend might not improve</L>

<L>As apprehension oft has made</L>

<L>Possess'd of this, incog he flew,</L>

<L>Tho' censur'd in his regal part,</L>
<L>Still monarch of each subject heart.</L>

Fix'd on a lonely rural spot,</L>

<L>All equipage was drop'd of course,</L>

<HEAD>FABLE XXIV. THE MAGPYE AND LARK.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>A MAGPYE, who with constant rattle,</L>
<L>Could fast as any gossip prattle;</L>
<L>A forward, pert, conceited elf,</L>
<L>Enraptur'd with delightful self;</L>
<L>Beheld a LARK who sung hard by,</L>
<L>With much contempt and scornful eye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The songster heard with patient ears,</L>
<L>A multitude of daily sneers;</L>
<L>And bore them all, howe'er absurd,</L>
<L>Nor answer'd once the coxcomb bird;</L>
<L>But like a wise domestic did</L>
<L>Whate'er his tender master bid;</L>
<L>No business minded, but his own,</L>
<L>And studied grateful songs alone.</L>
</LG>

<PB N="132" REF="140"/>
<L>No SPARTAN in the pilf'ring art</L>
<L>Could play with more success his part,</L>
<L>Than did the MAGPYE: when set free</L>
<L>To bear young master company;</L>
<L>Whate'er his bill, and strength could take,</L>
<L>He bore away for mischief's sake;</L>
<L>For things thus lost, if servants fought,</L>
<L>'Twas happiness supreme he thought:</L>
<L>His mistress, too, he told of all</L>
<L>Which in the kitchen could befall;</L>
<L>What sweethearts were admitted there,</L>
<L>How long they staid, and what their fare;</L>
<L>Nor could the maidens undescried,</L>
<L>A secret dish of tea provide;</L>
<L>Nay, rather, tattler like, than fail,</L>
<L>He'd soon invent a curious tale.</L>

<LG>
<L>One morning, all he thought at rest,</L>
<L>(The greatest knaves are fools at best;)</L>
<L><PB N="133" REF="141"/>
In triumph, to the LARK he cries,</L>
<L>What ho, you warbler of the skies,</L>
<L>If any spirit fir'd your heart,</L>
<L>How could you act this hum-drum part;</L>
<L>Thus idly pass an useless age,</L>
<L>Within the limits of your cage,</L>
<L>And only strain with empty note,</L>
<L>Your most unprofitable throat?</L>
<L>While I'm so active in the house,</L>
<L>I scarcely miss a stirring mouse;</L>
<L>I see, I hear, and straight unfold,</L>
<L>Whate'er may make our mistress scold;</L>
<L>Who loves, you know, or right or wrong,</L>
<L>To exercise her <HI>ceaseless</HI> tongue;</L>
<L>And when I've made a hideous pother,</L>
<L>Flings me some nice tit bit, or other—</L>
<L>Besides, it is my constant plan,</L>
<L>To steal, and hide whate'er I can;</L>
<L><PB N="134" REF="142"/>
Then shrewdly tell the servant's name,</L>
<L>I wish to brand with loss and shame:</L>

<L>My happy talents are display'd,</L>

<L>While you so little notice claim,</L>
<L>Scarce once a week I hear your name;</L>
<L>And like the wild ones of your breed,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>A servant maid, at morning's break,</L>
<L>By Love, or Conscience kept awake;</L>
<L>Heard MAGGY'S tale; when, fir'd with rage,</L>
<L>She flew directly to his cage;</L>
<L>Then seiz'd him, and with many a thump,</L>
<L>Convey'd him underneath the pump;</L>
<L>Where dous'd and drench'd almost to death;</L>
<L>While yet he drew some doubtful breath,</L>

Tattler, LARDELLA cry'd, take that;</L>

<L>Assisted by dishonest guile,</L>

<L>Enjoying sweets to purchase pain?</L>
<L>To boast, I find, with vicious pride,</L>
