<HEAD>THE LIFE OF <HI>MARK AKENSIDE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MARK AKENSIDE, an eminent poet and physician, was born at Newcastle upon Tyne the 9th Nov. 1721. He was second son of Mark Akenside, a substantial butcher of that town: his mother's name was Mary Lumsden. At the freeschool of Newcastle young Akenside received the first part of his education; he was next committed to the care of Mr. Wilson, a dis∣senting clergyman who kept a private academy at Newcastle.</P>
<P>About the eighteenth year of his age our Author was sent to the university of Edinburgh, in the view of qualifying himself for the duties of a Presbyterian pastor, his parents and relations in general being of the Presbyterian sect. Mr. Akenside received some assistance from the funds which the English Dissenters employ in educating young men of no opulent for∣tunes; but his views as to the ministry altering, he bent his studies towards physick, and honestly repaid to his benefactors the money they had advanced for him, which being contributed for a different purpose than promoting the study of physick he thought it disho∣nourable to retain. Whether in relinquishing his de∣sign of being a Dissenting clergyman he also ceased to be a Dissenter is not certainly known.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="6"/>
Akenside's genius and taste for poetry displayed themselves early when at Newcastle school, and du∣ring his continuance at Mr. Wilson's academy. His Pleasures of Imagination, with several other poems, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> said, were first written by him at Morpeth while upon a visit to his relations, and before he went to the university of Edinburgh, where he also distinguished himself by his poetical compositions. His Ode on the Winter Solstice, which is dated 1740, was certainly composed at that place.</P>
<P>After three years study at Edinburgh Mr. Aken∣side went (1741) to Leyden, where on 16th May 1744 he took his degree of Doctor in Physick. Same year appeared his Pleasures of Imagination, a poem which procured him some emolument and much re∣putation. This poem was followed by An Epistle to Curio, an acrimonious attack on the political con∣duct of William Pulteney Earl of Bath, whom he stigmatizes under the name of Curio as the betrayer of his country, also published in the 1744. Akenside dissatisfied with this performance altered it exceed∣ingly: he converted the Epistle into an Ode, and re∣duced it to less than half the number of lines of which it originally consisted. In the 1745 he published his first Collection of Odes, ten in number. In 1748 came out his Ode to the Earl of Huntingdon; and in 1758 he attempted to rouse the national spirit by An Ode to the Country Gentlemen of England. Few of his re∣maining
<PB N="vii" REF="7"/>
poems were published separately, excepting the Ode to Thomas Edwards, Esq. which though written in 1751 was not printed till the year 1766. The rest of Dr. Akenside's poems which appeared in his lifetime were given, at least for the most part, in the sixth volume of Dodsley's Collection.</P>
<P>Soon after his return from Leyden he commenced physician at Northampton, where Dr. Stonehouse then practised with reputation and success. Whilst here he carried on an amicable debate with Dr. Dod∣dridge concerning the opinions of the ancient philo∣sophers with regard to a future state of rewards and punishments, in which Dr. Akenside supported the firm belief of Cicero in particular in this great article of natural religion. Not meeting with sufficient en∣couragement at Northampton, or being ambitious of a larger field in which to display his talents, he re∣moved to Hampstead, where he resided upwards of two years, and then finally fixed himself in London.</P>
<P>At London he was well known as a poet, but had still to force his way as a physician. At first he had but little practice, and would probably have been reduced to difficulties had not Mr. Dyson, his intimate friend, generously allowed him 300<HI>l.</HI> a year, which enabled him to make a proper appearance in the world. In time the Doctor acquired considerable reputation and practice, and arrived at most of the honours incident to his profession: he became a Fellow of the Royal
<PB N="viii" REF="8"/>
Society, a Physician to St. Thomas's Hospital, was ad∣mitted by mandamus to the degree of Doctor in Phy∣sick in the university of Cambridge, and elected a Fel∣low of the Royal College of Physicians in London, and upon the settlement of the Queen's household was appointed one of the Physicians to her Majesty. He perhaps might have still rose to a greater eleva∣tion of character had not his studies ended with his life by a putrid fever 23d June 1770, in the 49th year of his age. He was buried in the parish of St. James's Westminster.</P>
<P>Dr. Akenside was much devoted to the study of ancient literature, and was a great admirer of Plato, Cicero, and the best philosophers of antiquity. His knowledge and taste in this respect are conspicuous in his poems, and in the Notes and Illustrations which he hath annexed to them. That he had a sincere re∣verence for the great and fundamental principles of religion is apparent from numberless passages in his writings. His high veneration for the Supreme Being, his noble sentiments of the wisdom and benevolence of the Divine Providence, and his zeal for the cause of virtue, are conspicuous in all his poems. His re∣gard to the Christian revelation, and his solicitude to have it preserved in its native purity, are displayed in the Ode to the Bishop of Winchester, His attachment to the cause of civil and religious liberty is a distin∣guished feature in the character of his poetical writ∣ings:
<PB N="ix" REF="9"/>
he embraces every occasion of displaying his ardour concerning this subject; and two of his Odes, those to the Earl of Huntingdon and the Bishop of Winchester, are directly consecrated to it.</P>
<P>Dr. Akenside is to be considered as a didactick and lyrick poet. His chief work, The Pleasures of Ima∣gination, was received with great applause, and raised the Author's reputation high in the poetical world. Pope, on looking into the manuscript before publica∣tion, is reported to have said <Q REND="inline">"That the Author was no every-day writer."</Q> Mr. Cooper, in his Letters concerning Taste, speaks of Akenside in the follow∣ing strain of commendation: <Q REND="inline">"For my part I am of opinion that there is now living a poet of as genu∣ine a genius as this kingdom ever produced, Shake∣speare alone excepted. By poetical genius I do not mean the mere talent of making verses, but that glorious enthusiasm of soul, that fine phrensy, in which the poet's <HI>eye rowling glances from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven,</HI> as Shakespeare feelingly describes it. This alone is poetry; aught else is a mechanical art of putting syllables harmonicusly to∣gether. The gentleman I mean is Dr. Akenside, the worthy Author of The Pleasures of Imagination, the most beautiful didactick poem that ever adorned the English language."</Q> On the other hand the late Mr. Gray, in a letter to Mr. Wharton of Old Park near Durham, dated Peterhouse 26th April 1744,
<PB N="x" REF="10"/>
(Mason's 4to edit. of Gray, p. 178.) says, <Q REND="inline">"You de∣sire to know, it seems, what character the poem of your young friend (Dr. Akenside) bears here. I wonder that you ask the opinion of a nation where those who pretend to judge do not judge at all, and the rest (the wiser part) wait to catch the judg∣ment of the world immediately above them, that is, Dick's and the Rainbow coffeehouses. Your readier way would be to ask the ladies who keep the bars in those two theatres of criticism. However, to shew you that I am a judge as well as my countrymen, I will tell you, though I have rather turned it over than read it, (Pleasures of Imagination) but no mat∣ter, no more have they, that it seems to me above the middling, and now and then, for a little while, rises even to the best, particularly in description. It is often obscure, and even unintelligible, and too much infected with the Hutchinson jargon. In short, its great fault is that it was published at least nine years too early. And so methinks, in a few words, <HI>a la mode du Temple.</HI> I have very prettily dis∣patched what perhaps may for several years have employed a very ingenious man worth fifty of my∣self."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"As these observations were hastily delivered in a private letter, before the poem had been maturely examined, we may be allowed (say the writers of The Biographia to think them too severe, and to
<PB N="xi" REF="11"/>
steer a middle course between Mr. Gray and Mr. Cooper. The obscurity of The Pleasures of Imagi∣nation, when read with attention, will chiefly be found in the allegory of the second book, which we freely confess we could never understand. It might likewise have been better if the peculiar language of Hutchinson, or rather of Shaftesbury, had some∣times been omitted. Nevertheless we cannot but regard it as a noble and beautiful poem, exhibiting many bright displays of genius and fancy, and hold∣ing out sublime views of Nature, Providence, and morality. We concur with Mr. Gray in thinking it was published too early: the Author himself be∣came afterwards of the same sentiment; he was con∣vinced that the poem was defective in some re∣spects, and redundant in others."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"That it want∣ed revision and correction,"</Q> says Mr. Dyson, his editor, <Q REND="inline">"he was sufficiently sensible; but so quick was the demand for several successive republications, that in any of the intervals to have completed the whole of his corrections was utterly impossible; and yet to have gone on from time to time in making farther improvements in every new edition would, he thought, have had the appearance at least of abu∣sing the favour of the publick: he chose therefore to continue for some time reprinting it without al∣teration, and to forbear publishing any corrections or improvements until he should be able at once to
<PB N="xii" REF="12"/>
give them to the publick complete: and with this view he went on for several years to review and correct his poem at leisure, till at length he found the task grow so much upon his hands, that despair∣ing of ever being able to execute if sufficiently to his own satisfction he abandoned the purpose of cor∣recting, and resolved to write the poem over anew, upon a somewhat different and an enlarged plan."</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Akenside did not live to finish the whole of his plan: that part of it which is carried into execution occurs next in this edition, and the reader may judge of the Doctor's intentions by having recourse to the Ge∣neral Argument prefixed to the poem. He designed at first to compromise the whole of his subject, accord∣ing to a new plan, in four books; but he afterwards changed his purpose, and determined to distribute The Pleasures of Imagination into a greater number of books. How far his scheme would have carried him, if he had lived to complete it, is uncertain, for at his death he had only finished the first and second books, a considerable part of the third, and the introduction to the fourth. The first book of the improved work bears a nearer resemblance to the first book of the former editions than any of the rest do to each other: there are nevertheless in this book a great number of correc∣tions and alterations, and several considerable additi∣ons. Dr Akenside has introduced a tribute of respect and affection to his friend Mr. Dyson; he has referred
<PB N="xiii" REF="13"/>
The Pleasures of Imagination to two sources only, Greatness and Beauty, and not to three, as he had heretofore done: his delineation of beautiful objects is much enlarged; and, upon the whole, the first book seems to have received no small degree of improve∣ment. The second book is very different from the se∣cond book of the preceeding editions: the difference indeed is so great that they cannot be compared toge∣ther. The Author enters into a display of Truth and its three classes, matter of Fact, experimental or scien∣tifical Truth, and universal Truth. He treats likewise of Virtue, as existing in the Divine Mind, of human virtue, of Vice and its origin, of Ridicule, and of the Passions. What he hath said upon the subject of ridi∣cule is greatly and advantageously reduced from what it was in the former copies. The enumeration of the different sources of ridicule is left out, and consequently somelines which had given offence to Dr. Warburton. The allegorical Vision which heretofore constituted a principal part of the second book is likewise omitted. The poetical character of the second book, as it now stands, is, that it is correct, moral, and noble. The third book is an episode, in which Solon the Athenian lawgiver is the chief character; and the design of it seems to be, to shew the great influence of poetry in enforcing the cause of Liberty. This part is entirely new, and if it had been finished would have proved a beautiful addition to the poem. It is greatly to be re∣gretted
<PB N="xiv" REF="14"/>
that Dr. Akenside did not live to complete his design; nevertheless we should have been sorry to have had the original poem entirely superseded. What∣ever may be its faults there is in it a certain brightness and brilliancy of imagination, and a certain degree of enthusiasm, which the Doctor did not seem to have possessed in equal vigour in the latter part of his life. Years, and an application to scientifick studies, appear in some measure to have turned his mind from sound to things, from fancy to the understanding.</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson, in his life of Akenside, says of this poem, <Q REND="inline">"It has undoubtedly a just claim to very par∣ticular notice, as an example of great felicity of ge∣nius, and uncommon amplitude of acquisitions, of a young mind stored with images, and much exer∣cised in combining and comparing them."</Q> Of the altered work he adds, <Q REND="inline">"He seems to have somewhat contracted his diffusion; but I know not whether he has gained in closeness what he has lost in splen∣dour."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To The Pleasures of Imagination,"</Q> continue the authors of The Biographia, <Q REND="inline">"succeed two books of Odes, the first containing eighteen, the second fif∣teen odes. It was Dr. Akenside's intention, if he had lived, to have made each book consist of twenty odes. Those which had been formerly published are greatly altered and improved. The Doctor's odes are not equal to the beautiful productions of
<PB N="xv" REF="15"/>
Mr Gray, nor perhaps to those of one or two living writers; but still there is in them a noble vein of poetry, united with manly sense, and applied to ex∣cellent purposes. This encomium cannot be extend∣ed to the whole of the odes without exception: Dr. Akenside does not always preserve the dignity of the lyrick Muse: he is defective in the pathetick even upon a subject which peculiarly required it, and where it might have been most expected, the death of his mistress, we mean his Ode to the Even∣ing Star. However, his Hymn to Cheerfulness, and his Odes on leaving Holland, on Lyrick Poetry, to the Earl of Huntingdon, and on Recovering from a sit of Sickness, justly entitle him to a place among the principal Lyrick writers of this country."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Of his Odes,"</Q> says Dr. Johnson, <Q REND="inline">"nothing fa∣vourable can be said.—To examine such composi∣tions singly cannot be required; they have doubt∣less brighter and darker parts; but when they are once found to be generally dull all further labour may be spared: for to what use can the work be criticised that will not be read?"</Q> In this diversity of opinions the reader will determine for himself.</P>
<P>Dr. Akenside's principal medical performance was, 1. His Dissertatio de Dysenteria, published in 1764, which has been commended as an elegant specimen of Latinity: it was twice translated into English. He also wrote, 2. Observations on the Origin and Use of
<PB N="xvi" REF="16"/>
the Lymphatick Vessels in Animals. 3. An Account of a Blow on the Heart, and its Effects. 4. Oratio Anniversaria, ex Instituto Harveii, in Theatro Col∣legii Regalis Modicorum Londinensis habita, Anno 1759. 5. Observations on Cancers. 6. Of the Use of Ipecacuanha in Asthmas. 7. A Method of treating White Swellings of the Joints. Besides these he read at the College some Practical Observations made at St. Thomas's Hospital on the putrid Erysipelas, which he intended forthe second volume of The Medical Trans∣actions. This paper he carried home with a design to correct it, but it was not returned at the time of his death. Being appointed Cronian Lecturer he chose for his subject <Q REND="inline">"The History of the Revival of Learn∣ing,"</Q> and read three lectures on it before the College, but from which he soon desisted, it was supposed in disgust, some one of the College having objected that he had chosen a subject foreign to the institution. Most of the above pieces were published in The Phi∣losophical and Medical Transactions.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT TO THE EDITION 1772.</HEAD>
<P>THIS volume contains a complete collection of the poems of the late Dr. Akenside, either reprinted from the original editions, or faithfully published from co∣pies which had been prepared by himself for publi∣cation.</P>
<P>That the principal poem should appear in so disad∣vantageous a state may require some explanation. The first publication of it was at a very early part of the Author's life; that it wanted revision and cor∣rection he was sufficiently sensible; but so quick was the demand for several successive republications, that in any of the intervals to have completed the whole of his corrections was utterly impossible; and yet to have gone on from time to time in making farther im∣provements in every new edition would, he thought, have had the appearance at least of abusing the favour of the publick: he chose therefore to continue for some time reprinting it without alteration, and to forbear publishing any corrections or improvements until he should be able at once to give them to the publick complete: and with this view he went on for several years to review and correct his poem at leisure, till at length he found the task grow so much upon his hands, that despairing of ever being able to execute it suf∣ficiently to his own satisfaction he abandoned the
<PB N="18" REF="18"/>
purpose of correcting, and resolved to write the poem over anew upon a somewhat different and an enlar∣ged plan: and in the execution of this design he had made a considerable progress. What reason there may be to regret that he did not live to execute the whole of it will best appear from the perusal of the plan itself, as stated in the General Argument, and of the parts which he had executed, and which are here publish∣ed: for the person<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Right Hon. Jeremiah Dyson, by whom this Adver∣tisement was written.</NOTE> to whom he intrusted the dis∣posal of his papers would have thought himself want∣ing as well to the service of the publick as to the fame of his friend if he had not produced as much of the work as appeared to have been prepared for publica∣tion. In this light he considered the entire first and second books, of which a few copies had been printed for the use only of the Author and certain friends; also a very considerable part of the third book, which had been transcribed in order to its being printed in the same manner; and to these is added the introduction to a subsequent book, which in the manuscript is call∣ed the fourth, and which appears to have been com∣posed at the time when the Author intended to com∣prise the whole in four books; but which, as he had afterwards determined to distribute the poem into more books, might perhaps more properly be call∣ed the last book. And this is all that is executed of
<PB N="19" REF="19"/>
the new work, which although it appeared to the editor too valuable, even in its imperfect state, to be withholden from the publick, yet (he conceives) takes in by much too small a part of the original poem to supply its place, and to supersede the republication of it; for which reason both the poems are inserted in this Collection.</P>
<P>Of Odes the Author had designed to make up two books, consisting of twenty odes each, including the several odes which he had before published at diffe∣rent times.</P>
<P>The Hymn to the Naiads is reprinted from the sixth volume of Dodsley's Miscellanies, with a few corrections, and the addition of some Notes. To the Inscriptions, taken from the same volume, three new Inscriptions are added, the last of which is the only instance wherein a liberty has been taken of inserting any thing in this Collection which did not appear to have been intended by the Author for publication<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the present edition a few pieces are added which are known to be genuine, and which certainly are no discredit to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir Author.</NOTE>, among whose papers no copy of this was found, but it is printed from a copy which he had many years since given to the editor.</P>

<HEAD>THE DESIGN.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are certain powers in human nature which seem to hold a middle place between the organs of bo∣dly sense and the faculties of moral perception: they have been called by a very general name <Q REND="inline">"The Powers of Imagination."</Q> Like the external senses they re∣late to matter and motion, and at the same time give the mind ideas analogous to those of moral approba∣tion and dislike. As they are the inlets of some of the most exquisite Pleasures with which we are acquaint∣ed, it has naturally happened that men of warm and sensible tempers have sought means to recal the de∣lightful perceptions which they afford, independent of the objects which originally produced them. This gave rise to the imitative or designing arts, some of which, as painting and sculpture, directly copy the external appearances which were admired in nature; others, as musick and poetry, bring them back to remem∣brance by signs universally established and understood.</P>
<P>But these arts as they grew more correct and de∣liberate were of course led to extend their imitation beyond the peculiar objects of the imaginative powers especially poetry, which making use of language a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the instrument by which it imitates, is consequently become an unlimited representative of every speci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> and mode of being; yet as their intention was only to express the objects of Imagination, and as they still abound chiefly in ideas of that class, they of cours<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> retain their original character, and all the differen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="21" REF="21"/>
Pleasures which they excite are termed in general Pleasures of Imagination.</P>
<P>The Design of the following Poem is to give a view of these in the largest acceptation of the term, so that whatever our Imagination feels from the agreeable appearances of nature, and all the various entertain∣ment we meet with either in poetry, painting, musick, or any of the elegant arts, might be deducible from one or other of those principles in the constitution of the human mind which are here established and explained.</P>
<P>In executing this general plan it was necessary first of all to distinguish the Imagination from our other faculties, and in the next place to characterize those original forms or properties of being about which it is conversant, and which are by nature adapted to it, as light is to the eyes, or truth to the understanding. These properties Mr. Addison had reduced to the three general classes of Greatness, Novelty, and Beauty; and into these we may analyze every object, however complex, which, properly speaking, is delightful to the imagination. But such an object may also include many other sources of Pleasure, and its beauty, or no∣velty, or grandeur, will make a stronger impression by reason of this concurrence. Besides which the imi∣tative arts, especially poetry, owe much of their effect to a similar exhibition of properties quite foreign to the imagination, insomuch that in every line of the most applauded poems we meet with either ideas drawn from the external senses, or truths discovered
<PB N="22" REF="22"/>
to the understanding, or illustrations of contrivance and final causes, or, above all the rest, with circum∣stances proper to awaken and engage the passions; it was therefore necessary to enumerate and exemplify th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se different species of Pleasure, especially that from the passions, which as it is supreme in the noblest work of human genius, so being in some particulars not a little surprising, gave an opportunity to enliven the didactick turn of the poem by introducing an al∣legory to account for the appearance.</P>
<P>After these parts of the subject which hold chiefly of admiration, or naturally warm and interest the mind, a Pleasure of a very different nature, that which arises from Ridicule, came next to be considered. As this is the foundation of the comick manner in all the arts, and has been but very imperfectly treated by moral writers, it was thought proper to give it a par∣ticular illustration, and to distinguish the general sources from which the ridicule of characters is de∣rived. Here too a change of style became necessary, such a one as might yet be consistent, if possible, with the general taste of composition in the serious parts of the subject; nor is it an easy task to give any tolerable force to images of this kind without running eithe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> into the gigantick expressions of the mock heroick, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the familiar and poetical raillery of professed satire<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> neither of which would have been proper here.</P>

Pleasures which arise either from the relations of different objects one to another, or from the nature of imitation itself. Of the first kind is that various and complicated resemblance existing between several parts of the material and immaterial worlds, which is the foundation of metaphor and wit. As it seems in a great measure to depend on the early association of our ideas, and as this habit of associating is the source of many Pleasures and pains in life, and on that ac∣count bears a great share in the influence of poetry and the other arts, it is therefore mentioned here, and its effects described: then follows a general account of the production of these elegant arts, and of the se∣condary Pleasure, as it is called, arising from the re∣semblance of their imitations to the original appear∣ances of nature: after which the work concludes with some reflections on the general conduct of the powers of Imagination, and on their natural and moral use∣fulness in life.</P>
<P>Concerning the manner or turn of composition which prevails in this piece little can be said with pro∣priety by the Author. He had two models; that an∣cient and simple one of the first Grecian poets, as it is refined by Virgil in the Georgicks, and the familiar epistolary way of Horace. This latter has several ad∣vantages: it admits of a greater variety of style; it more readily engages the generality of readers, as par∣taking more of the air of conversation, and especially with the assistance of rhyme leads to a closer and
<PB N="24" REF="24"/>
more concise expression. Add to this the example of the most perfect of modern poets, who has so happily applied this manner to the noblest parts of philosophy that the publick taste is in a great measure formed to it alone. Yet, after all, the subject before us, tend∣ing almost constantly to admiration and enthusiasm, seemed rather to demand a more open, pathetick, and figured style. This too appeared more natural, as the Author's aim was not so much to give formal pre∣cepts, or enter into the way of direct argumentation, as by exhibiting the most engaging prospects of na∣ture to enlarge and harmonize the Imagination, and by that means insensibly dispose the minds of men to a similar taste and habit of thinking in religion, mo∣rals, and civil life. It is on this account that he is so careful to point out the benevolent intention of the Author of Nature in every principle of the human constitution here insisted on, and also to unite the mo∣ral excellencies of life in the same point of view with the mere external objects of good taste; thus recom∣mending them in common to our natural propensity for admiring what is beautiful and lovely. The same views have also led him to introduce some sentiment<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which may perhaps be looked upon as not quite di∣rect to the subject; but since they bear an obvious re¦lation to it the authority of Virgil, the faultless mo¦del of didactick poetry, will best support him in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> particular: for the sentiments themselves he make<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no apology.</P>

<P>The difficulty in this case will be removed if we consider that, when objects at first agreeable lose that influence by fre∣quently recurring, the mind is wholly passive and the percep∣tion involuntary; but habit on the other hand generally sup∣poses choice and activity accompanying it; so that the plea∣sure arises here not from the object but from the mind's con∣scious determination of its own activity, and consequently in∣creases in proportion to the frequency of that determination.</P>
<P>It will still be urged perhaps that a familiarity with disagree∣able objects renders them at length acceptable, even when there is no room for the mind to resolve or act at all: in this case the appearance must be accounted for one of these ways:</P>
<P>The pleasure from habit may be merely negative. The ob∣ject at first gave uneasiness; this uneasiness gradually wears off as the object grows familiar; and the mind finding it at last en∣tirely removed, reckons its situation really pleasureable com∣pared with what it had experienced before.</P>
<P>The dislike conceived of the object at first might be owing to prejudice or want of attention; consequently the mind be∣ing necessitated to review it often may at length perceive its own mistake, and be reconciled to what it had looked on with aversion; in which case a sort of instinctive justice naturally leads it to make amends for the injury by running toward the other extreme of fondness and attachment.</P>
<P>Or, lasly, though the object itself should always continue disagreeable, yet circumstances of pleasure or good fortune may occur along with it: thus an association may arise in the mind and the object never be remembered without those plea∣sing circumstances attending it, by which means the disa∣greeable impression which it at first occasioned will in time be quite obliterated.</P></NOTE></L>

Accomplish'd. Thus was Beauty sent from Heav'n</L>
<L>The lovely ministress of Truth and Good</L>
<L>In this dark world; for Truth and Good are one,<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>℣. 374. <HI>—Truth and Good are one,—And Beauty dweils in them.</HI> &amp;c.] <Q REND="inline">"Do you imagine,"</Q> says Socrates to Aristippus, <Q REND="inline">"that what is good is not beautiful? have you not observed that these appearances always coincide? Virtue, for instance, in the same respect as to which we call it good is ever ac∣knowledged to be beautiful also. In the characters of men we always join the two denominations together<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This the Athenians did in a peculiar manner by the words <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>. The beauty of human bodies corresponds in like manner with that economy of parts which constitutes them good, and in every circumstance of life the same object is constantly ac∣counted both beautiful and good, inasmuch as it answers the purposes for which it was designed." <BIBL><HI>Xenoph. Memorab. Socrat.</HI> lib. iii. cap. 8.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>This excellent observation has been illustrated and extended by the noble restorer of ancient philosophy. See <BIBL><HI>The Charac∣teristicks,</HI> vol. ii. p. 339 and 422, and vol. iii. p. 181.</BIBL> And an∣other ingenious author has particularly shewn that it holds in the general laws of Nature, in the works of art, and the con∣duct of the sciences. <BIBL><HI>Inquiry into the Original of our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue,</HI> Treat. i. sect. 8.</BIBL> As to the connexion be∣tween beauty and truth, there are two opinions concerning it. Some philosophers assert an independent and invariable law in Nature, in consequence of which <Q REND="inline">"all rational beings must a∣like perceive beauty in some certain proportions, and defor∣mity in the contrary."</Q> And this necessity being supposed the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame with that which commands the assent or dissent of the understanding, it follows of course that beauty is founded on the universal and unchangeable law of truth.</P>
<P>But others there are who believe beauty to be merely a re∣lative and arbitrary thing; that indeed it was a benevolent provision in Nature to annex so delightful a sensation to those objects which are best and most perfect in themselves, that so we might be engaged to the choice of them at once, and with∣out having to infer their usefulness from their structure and effects; but that it is not impossible, in a physical sense, that two beings of equal capacities for truth should perceive one of them beauty and the other deformity in the same propor∣tions. And upon this supposition, by that truth which is al∣ways connected with beauty, nothing more can be meant than the conformity of any object to those proportions upon which after careful examination the beauty of that species is found to depend. Polycietus, for instance, a famous ancient sculptor, from an accurate mensuration of the several parts of the most perfect human bodies deduced a canon or system of propor∣tions which was the rule of all succeeding artists. Suppose a statue modelled according to this, a man of mere natural taste upon looking at it, without entering into its proportions, confesses and admires its beauty; whereas a professor of the art applies his measures to the head, the neck, or the hand, and without attending to its beauty pronounces the workman∣ship to be just and true.</P></NOTE></L>

<P>THE separation of the works of Imagination from philosophy the cause of their abuse among the Moderns. Prospect of their reunion under the influence of publick liberty. Enumeration of accidental Pleasures, which increase the effect of objects delightful to the Imagination. The Pleasures of sense. Particular circumstances of the mind. Discovery of truth. Perception of contrivance and design. Emotion of the pas∣sions. All the natural passions partake of a pleasing sensation; with the final cause of this constitution illustrated by an Allegorical Vision, and exemplified in sorrow, pity, terrour, and indignation.</P>

<L>At last the Muses rose and spurn'd their bonds,<NOTE PLACE="foot">℣. 19. <HI>At last the Muses rose,</HI> &amp;c.] About the age of Hugh Capet, founder of the third race of French kings, the poets of Provence were in high reputation, a sort of strolling bards or rhapodists, who went about the courts of princes and noble∣men entertaining them at festivals with musick and poetry.

<L>Peculiar minds, so haply where the pow'rs<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>℣. 18. <HI>—where the pow'rs—Of fancy,</HI> &amp;c.] The influ∣ence of the Imagination on the conduct of life is one of the most important points in moral philosophy. It were easy by an induction of facts to prove that the Imagination directs al∣most all the passions, and mixes with almost everycircumstance of action or pleasure. Let any man, even of the coldest head and soberest industry, analyze the idea of what he calls his In∣terest, he will find that it consists chiefly of certain degrees of decency, beauty, and order, variously combined into one sy∣stem, the idol which he seeks to enjoy by labour, hazard, and selfdenial. It is on this account of the last consequence to re∣gulate these images by the standard of Nature and the general good, otherwise the Imagination, by heightening some objects beyond their real excellence and beauty, or by representing others in a more odious or terrible shape than they deserve, may of course engage us in pursuits utterly inconsistent with the moral order of things.</P>
<P>If it be objected that this account of things supposes the passions to be merely accidental, whereas there appears in some a natural and hereditary disposition to certain passions, prior to all circumstances of education or fortune, it may be an∣swered, that though no man is born ambitious or a miser, yet he may inherit from his parents a peculiar temper or com∣plexion of mind which shall render his Imagination more li∣able to be struck with some particular objects, consequently dispose him to form opinions of good and ill, and entertain pas∣sions of a particular turn. Some men, for instance, by the ori∣ginal frame of their minds are more delighted with the vast and magnificent, others, on the contrary, with the elegant and gentle aspects of Nature: and it is very remarkable that the disposition of the moral powers is always similar to this of the Imagination; that those who are most inclined to admire prodigious and sublime objects in the physical world are also most inclined to applaud examples of fortitude and heroick virtue in the moral; while those who are charmed rather with the delicacy and sweetness of colours, and forms, and sounds, never fail, in like manner, to yield the preference to the softer scenes of virtue and the sympathies of a domestick life. And this is sufficient to account for the objection.</P>
<P>Among the ancient philosophers though we have several hints concerning this influence of the Imagination upon mo∣rals among the remains of the Socratick school, yet the Stoicks were the first who paid it a due attention. Zeno their founder thought it impossible to preserve any tolerable regularity in life without frequently inspecting those pictures or appearan∣ces of things which the Imagination offers to the mind. <BIBL><HI>Diog. Laert.</HI> l. vii.</BIBL> The Meditations of M. Aurelius, and The Dis∣courses of Epictetus, are full of the same sentiment, insomuch that the latter makes the <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <Q REND="inline">"right management of the fancies,"</Q> the only thing for which we are accountable to Providence, and without which a man is no other than stupid or frantick. <BIBL><HI>Arrian.</HI> l. i. c. 12. and l. ii. c. 22.</BIBL> See also <BIBL><HI>The Characteristicks,</HI> vol.

Nay, farther, even when we perceive the turpitude tending to the destruction of its subject we may still be sensible of a ridiculous appearance till the ruin become imminent, and the keener sensations of pity or terrour banish the ludicrous appre∣hension from our minds; for the sensation of ridicule is not a bare perception of the agreement or disagreement of ideas, but a passion or emotion of the mind consequential to that perception; so that the mind may perceive the agreement or disagreement, and yet not feel the ridiculous, because it is en∣grossed by a more violent emotion. Thus it happens that some men think those objects ridiculous to which others can∣not endure to apply the name, because in them they excite a much intenser and more important feeling: and this diffe∣rence, among other causes, has brought a good deal of confu∣sion into this question.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That which makes objects ridiculous is some ground of admiration or esteem connected with other more general circumstances comparatively worthless or deformed; or it is some circumstance of turpitude or deformity connected with what is in general excellent or beautiful; the incon∣sistent properties existing either in the objects themselves, or in the apprehension of the person to whom they relate, belonging always to the same order or class of being, imply∣ing sentiment or design, and exciting no acute or vehement emotion of the heart."</Q></P>
<P>To prove the several parts of this definition: <Q REND="inline">"The appear∣ance of excellence or beauty connected with a general con∣dition comparatively sordid or deformed"</Q> is ridiculous: for instance, pompous pretensions of wisdom, joined with ig∣norance or folly, in the Socrates of Aristophanes, and the o∣stentations of military glory with cowardice and stupidity, in the Thraso of Terence.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The appearance of deformity or turpitude in conjunction with what is in general excellent or venerable"</Q> is also ridi∣culous: for instance, the personal weaknesses of a magistrate appearing in the solemn and publick functions of his station.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The incongruous properties may either exist in the ob∣jects themselves, or in the apprehension of the person to whom they relate:"</Q> in the last mentioned instance they both exist in the objects; in the instances from Aristophanes and Terence one of them is objective and real, the other only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounded in the apprehension of the ridiculous character.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The inconsistent properties must belong to the same or∣der or class of being."</Q> A coxcomb in fine clothes bedaubed by accident in foul weather is a ridiculous object; because his general apprehension of excellence and esteem is referred to the splendour and expense of his dress. A man of sense and merit in the same circumstances is not counted ridiculous, because the general ground of excellence and esteem in him is, both in fact and in his own apprehension, of a very different species.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Every ridiculous object implies sentiment or design."</Q> A column placed by an architect without a capital or base is laughed at; the same column in a ruin causes a very different sensation.</P>
<P>And, lastly, <Q REND="inline">"the occurrence must excite no acute or vehe∣ment emotion of the heart,"</Q> such as terrour, pity, or indig∣nation; for in that case, as was observed above, the mind is not at leisure to contemplate the ridiculous.</P>
<P>Whether any appearance not ridiculous be involved in this description, and whether it comprehend every species and form of the ridiculous, must be determined by repeated appli∣cations of it to particular instances.</P></NOTE></L>

<L>Ask we for what fair end th'Almighty Sire<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>℣. 259. <HI>Ask we for what fair end,</HI> &amp;c.] Since it is beyond all contradiction evident that we have a natural sense or feel∣ing of the ridiculous, and since so good a reason may be assign∣ed to justify the Supreme Being for bestowing it, one cannot without astonishment reflect on the conduct of those men who imagine it is for the service of true religion to vilify and black∣en it without distinction, and endeavour to persuade us that it is never applied but in a bad cause. Ridicule is not con∣cerned with mere speculative truth or falsehood. It is not in abstract propositions or theorems, but in actions and passions, good and evil, beauty and deformity, that we find materials for it; and all these terms are relative, implying approbation or blame. To ask them whether ridicule be a test of truth is, in other words, to ask whether that which is ridiculous can be morally true, can be just and becoming; or whether that which is just and becoming can be ridiculous: a question that does not deserve a serious answer; for it is most evident that, as in a me∣taphysical proposition offered to the understanding for its assent, the faculty of reason examines the terms of the proposition, and finding one idea which was supposed equal to another to be in fact unequal, of consequence rejects the proposition as a falsehood: so in objects offered to the mind for its esteem or applause the faculty of ridicule finding an incongruity in the claim urges the mind to reject it with laughter and contempt. When therefore we observe such a claim obtruded upon man∣kind, and the inconsistent circumstances carefully concealed from the eye of the publick, it is our business, if the matter be of importance to society, to drag out those latent circum∣stances, and by setting them in full view to convince the world how ridiculous the claim is: and thus a double advantage is gained, for we both detect the moral falsehood sooner than in the way of speculative inquiry, and impress the minds of men with a stronger sense of the vanity and errour of its authors. And this and no more is meant by the application of ridicule.</P>
<P>But it is said the practice is dangerous, and may be incon∣sistent with the regard we owe to objects of real dignity and excellence. I answer, the practice fairly managed can never be dangerous: men may be dishonest in obtruding circum∣stances foreign to the object, and we may be inadvertent in allowing those circumstances to impose upon us; but the sense of ridicule always judges right. The Socrates of Aristo∣phanes is as truly ridiculous a character as ever was drawn:—true; but it is not the character of Socrates, the divine mo∣ralist, and father of ancient wisdom. What then? did the ri∣dicule of the poet hinder the philosopher from detecting and disclaiming those foreign circumstances which he had falsely introduced into his character, and thus rendered the sat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> doubly ridiculous in his turn? No; but it nevertheless had an ill influence on the minds of the people. And so has the rea∣soning of Spinoza made many Atheists: he has founded it in∣deed on suppositions utterly false; but allow him these and his conclusions are unavoidably true. And if we must reject the use of ridicule because by the imposition of false circum∣stances things may be made to seem ridiculous which are not so in themselves, why we ought not in the same manner to reject the use of reason, because by proceeding on false prin∣ciples conclusions will appear true which are impossible in nature, let the vehement and obstinate declaimers against ri∣dicule determine.</P></NOTE></L>

<HEAD>THE PLEASURES OF IMAGINATION.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="preface">
<HEAD>The General Argument.</HEAD>
<P>THE Pleasures of the Imagination proceed either from natural objects, as from a flourishing grove, a clear and murmuring fountain, a calm sea by moonlight, or from works of art, such as a noble edifice, a musical tune, a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, a picture, a poem. In treating of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Pleasures we must begin with the former class, they being original to the other; and nothing more being necessary in order to explain them than a view of our natural inclination to∣ward greatness and beauty, and of those appearances in the world around us to which that inclination is adapted. This is the subject of the first book of the following poem.</P>
<P>But the Pleasures which we receive from the elegant arts, from musick, sculpture, painting, and poetry, are much more various and complicated. In them (besides great∣ness and beauty, or forms proper to the Imagination) we find interwoven frequent representations of truth, of vir∣tue and vice, of circumstances proper to move us with laughter, or to encite in us pity, fear, and the other pas∣sions. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se moral and intellectual objects are described in the second book, to which the third properly belongs as an episode, though too large to have been included in it.</P>
<P>With the abovementioned causes of Pleasure, which are universal in the course of human life, and appertain to
<PB N="115" REF="115"/>
our higher faculties, many others do generally concur, more limited in their operation, or of an inferiour origin; such are the novelty of objects, the association of ideas, af∣fections of the bodily senses, influences of education, na∣tional habits, and the like. To illustrate these, and from the whole to determine the character of a perfect taste, is the argument of the fourth book.</P>
<P>Hitherto the Pleasures of the Imagination belong to the hu∣man species in general; but there are certain particular men whose Imagination is endowed with powers and susceptible of Pleasures which the generality of mankind never participate: these are the men of genius, destined by Nature to excel in one or other of the arts already men∣tioned. It is proposed therefore in the last place, to de∣lineate that genius which in some degree appears common to them all, yet with a more peculiar consideration of poe∣try, inasmuch as poetry is the most extensive of those arts, the most philosophical, and the most useful.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>The Argument.</HEAD>
<P>INTRODUCTION to this more difficult part of the subject. Of truth and its three classes, matter of fact, experimental or scientifical truth, (cont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> distinguished from opinion) and universal truth; which last is either metaphysical or geometrical, either purely intellectual or per∣fectly a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>acted. On the power of discerning truth depends that of acting with the view of an end, a circumstance essential to virtue. Of virtue, considered in the Divine Mind as a perpetual and universal be∣neficence. Of human virtue, considered as a sysem of particular sen∣timents and actions, suitable to the design of Providence and the con∣dition of man, to whom it constitutes the chief good and the first beauty. Of vice and its origin. Of ridicule; its general nature and fi∣nal cause<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Of the passions, particularly of those which relate to evil natural or moral, and which are generally accounted painful, though not always unattended with Pleasure.</P>

<L>THUS far of Beauty and the pleasing forms</L>
<L>Which man's untutor'd fancy from the scenes</L>
<L>Imperfect of this ever-changing world</L>
<L>Creates and views enamour'd. Now my song</L>
<L N="5">Severer themes demand, mysterious truth,</L>
<L>And virtue, sovran good; the spells, the trains,</L>
<L>The progeny, of Errour; the dread sway</L>
<L>Of Passion, and whatever hidden stores</L>
<L>From her own lofty deeds and from herself</L>
<L N="10">The mind acquires. Severer argument,</L>
<L>Not less attractive nor deserving less</L>
<L>A constant ear: for what are all the forms</L>
<L>Educ'd by fancy from corporeal things,</L>
<L>Greatness, or pomp, or symmetry of parts?</L>
<L N="15"><PB N="144" REF="144"/>
Not tending to the heart soon seeble grows,</L>
<L>As the blunt arrow 'gainst the knotty trunk,</L>
<L>Their impulse on the sense, while the pall'd eye</L>
<L>Expects in vain its tribute, asks in vain</L>
<L>Where are the ornaments it once admir'd?</L>
<L N="20">Not so the moral species, nor the pow'rs</L>
<L>Of passion and of thought Th' ambitious mind</L>
<L>With objects boundless as her own desires</L>
<L>Can there converse: by these unfading forms</L>
<L>Touch'd and awaken'd still, with eager act</L>
<L N="25">She bends each nerve, and meditates wellpleas'd</L>
<L>Her gifts, her godlike fortune. Such the seenes</L>
<L>Now op'ning round us: may the destin'd Verse</L>

<L>Obscure and ard'ous! may the Source of Light,</L>

<L>Thro' ev'ry maze! and whom in childish years</L>
<L>From the loud throng, the beaten paths of wealth</L>
<L>And pow'r, thou didst apart send forth to speak</L>
<L>In tuneful words concerning highest things,</L>

<L>Of pensive freedom, when the human soul</L>
<L>Shuts out the rumour of the world, him still</L>
<L>Touch thou with secret lessons; call thou back</L>
<L>Each erring thought, and let the yielding strains</L>
<L N="40">From his full bosom like a welcome rill</L>

My perilous excursion than from truth,</L>
<L N="45">That nearest inmate of the human soul,</L>
<L>Estrang'd from whom the countenance divine</L>
<L>Of man dissigur'd and dishonour'd, sinks</L>
<L>Among inferiour things? for to the brutes</L>
<L>Perception and the transient boons of sense</L>
<L N="50">Hath Fate imparted, but to man alone</L>
<L>Of sublunary beings was it giv'n</L>
<L>Each fleeting impulse on the sensual pow'rs</L>
<L>At leisure to review, with equal eye</L>
<L>To sean the passion of the stricken nerve,</L>
<L N="55">Or the vague object striking, to conduct</L>
<L>From sense, the portal turbulent and loud,</L>
<L>Into the mind's wide palace one by one</L>
<L>The frequent, pressing, fluctuating, forms,</L>
<L>And question and compare them. Thus he learns</L>
<L N="60">Their birth and fortunes, how ally'd they haunt</L>
<L>The avenues of sense, what laws direct</L>
<L>Their union, and what various discords rise</L>
<L>Or fix'd or casual; which when his clear thought</L>
<L>Retains, and when his faithful words express,</L>
<L N="65">That living image of th' external scene,</L>
<L>As in a polish'd mirror held to view,</L>
<L>Is truth; where'er it varies from the shape</L>
<L>And hue of its exemplar, in that part</L>
<L>Dim errour lurks. Moreover, from without</L>
<L N="70">When oft' the same society of forms</L>
<L>In the same order have approach'd his mind,</L>
<L><PB N="146" REF="146"/>
He deigns no more their steps with curious heed</L>
<L>To trace; no more their features or their garb</L>
<L>He now examines, but of them and their</L>
<L N="75">Condition, as with some diviner's tongue,</L>
<L>Affirms what Heav'n in ev'ry distant place</L>
<L>Thro' ev'ry future season will decree:</L>
<L>This too is truth: where'er his prudent lips</L>
<L>Wait till experience diligent and flow</L>
<L N="80">Has authoris'd their sentence, this is truth;</L>
<L>A second higher kind; the parent this</L>
<L>Of Science, or the losty pow'r herself,</L>
<L>Science herself, on whom the wants and cares</L>
<L>Of social life depend, the substitute</L>
<L N="85">Of God's own wisdom in this toilsome world,</L>
<L>The providence of man. Yet ost' in vain</L>
<L>To earn her aid with fix'd and anxious eye</L>
<L>He looks on Nature's and on Fortune's course,</L>
<L>Too much in vain: his duller visual ray</L>
<L N="90">The stillness and the persevering acts</L>
<L>Of Nature oft' elude, and Fortune oft'</L>
<L>With step fantastick from her wonted walk</L>
<L>Turns into mazes dim: his sight is foil'd,</L>
<L>And the crude sentence of his falt'ring tongue</L>
<L N="95">Is but Opinion's verdict half believ'd,</L>
<L>And prone to change. Here thou who feelst thine ear</L>
<L>Congenial to my lyre's profounder tone</L>
<L>Pause and be watchful. Hitherto the stores</L>
<L>Which feed thy mind and exercise her pow'rs</L>

Their parent earth: but know a nobler dow'r</L>

<L>In eyes or ears to dwell within the sense</L>
<L N="105">Of earthly organs, but sublime were plac'd</L>
<L>In his essential reason, leading there</L>
<L>That vast ideal host which all his works</L>

<L>Thus then endow'd the feeble creature man,</L>
<L N="110">The slave of hunger and the prey of Death,</L>
<L>Even now, even here, in earth's dim prison bound,</L>
<L>The language of intelligence divine</L>

<L N="115">Those sovran dictates which in farthest heav'n,</L>
<L>Where no orb rowls, Eternity's fix'd ear</L>
<L>Hears from coeval truth, when Chance nor Change,</L>

<L>Dares intermeddle or approach her throne.</L>
<L N="120">Ere long o'er this corporeal world he learns</L>

<L N="125">He sets in view, th' impartial type of all</L>

Pronounceth of the kindred without bound,</L>

<L>Of triangle or circle, cube or cone,</L>
<L>Impassive all, whose attributes nor Force</L>
<L N="140">Nor Fate can alter: there he first conceives</L>
<L>True being and an intellectual world,</L>
<L>The same this hour and ever: thence he deems</L>
<L>Of his own lot above the painted shapes</L>
<L>That fleeting move o'er this terrestrial scene,</L>

<L>Of death expatiates, as his birthright claims</L>

The reign of Virtue. Ere the dayspring flow'd</L>

<L>They stood before the great Eternal Mind,</L>

<L>ONE effort more, one cheerful sally more,</L>
<L>Our destin'd course will finish; and in peace</L>
<L>Then for an off'ring sacred to the pow'rs</L>
<L>Who lent us gracious guidance we will then</L>
<L N="5">Inscribe a monument of deathless praise,</L>
<L>O my advent'rous Song! With steady speed</L>
<L>Long hast thou, on an untry'd voyage bound,</L>
<L>Sail'd between earth and heav'n; hast now survey'd</L>
<L>Stretch'd out beneath thee all the mazy tracks</L>
<L N="10">Of passion and opinion, like a waste</L>
<L>Of sands, and flow'ry lawns, and tangling woods,</L>
<L>Where mortals roam bewilder'd; and hast now</L>
<L>Exulting soar'd among the worlds above,</L>
<L>Or hover'd near th' eternal gates of heav'n,</L>
<L N="15">If haply the discourses of the gods</L>
<L>A curious but an unpresuming guest</L>
<L>Thou might'st partake, and carry back some strain</L>
<L>Of divine wisdom lawful to repeat</L>
<L>And apt to be conceiv'd of man below.</L>
<L N="20">A diff'rent task remains, the secret paths</L>
<L>Of early genius to explore, to trace</L>
<L>Those haunts where Fancy her predestin'd sons,</L>
<L>Like to the demigods of old, doth nurse</L>
<L>Remote from eyes profane. Ye happy Souls!</L>
<L N="25"><PB N="188" REF="188"/>
Who now her tender discipline obey,</L>
<L>Where dwell ye? what wild river's brink at eve</L>
<L>Imprint your steps? what solemn groves at noon</L>
<L>Use ye to visit, often breaking forth</L>
<L>In rapture 'mid your dilatory walk,</L>
<L N="30">Or musing as in slumber on the green?</L>
<L>—Would I again were with you!—O ye Dales</L>
<L>Of Tyne! and ye most ancient Woodlands! where</L>
<L>Oft' as the giant flood obliquely strides</L>
<L>And his banks open and his lawns extend</L>
<L N="35">Stops short the pleased traveller to view</L>
<L>Presiding o'er the scene some rustick tow'r</L>
<L>Founded by Norman or by Saxon hands;</L>
<L>O ye Northumbrian Shades! which overlook</L>
<L>The rocky pavement and the mossy falls</L>
<L N="40">Of solitary Wensbeck's limpid stream,</L>
<L>How gladly I recall your wellknown seats</L>
<L>Belov'd of old, and that delightful time</L>
<L>When all alone for many a summer's day</L>
<L>I wander'd thro' your calm recesses, led</L>
<L N="45">In silence by some pow'rful hand unseen.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor will I e'er forget you; nor shall e'er</L>
<L>The graver tasks of manhood or th' advice</L>
<L>Of vulgar wisdom move me to disclaim</L>
<L>Those studies which possess'd me in the dawn</L>
<L N="50">Of life, and fix'd the colour of my mind</L>
<L>For ev'ry future year; whence even now</L>
<L>From sleep I rescue the clear hours of morn,</L>
<L><PB N="189" REF="189"/>
And while the world around lies overwhelm'd</L>
<L>In idle darkness am alive to thoughts</L>
<L N="55">Of honourable fame, of truth divine</L>
<L>Or moral, and of minds to virtue won</L>
<L>By the sweet magick of harmonious verse,</L>
<L>The themes which now expect us. For thus far</L>
<L>On gen'ral habits, and on arts which grow</L>
<L N="60">Spontaneous in the minds of all mankind,</L>
<L>Hath dwelt our argument; and how selftaught,</L>
<L>Tho' seldom conscious of their own employ,</L>
<L>In Nature's or in Fortune's changeful scene</L>
<L>Men learn to judge of beauty, and acquire</L>
<L N="65">Those forms set up as idols in the soul</L>
<L>For love and zealous praise. Yet indistinct</L>
<L>In vulgar bosoms and unnotic'd lie</L>
<L>These pleasing stores, unless the casual force</L>
<L>Of things external prompt the heedless mind</L>
<L N="70">To recognize her wealth. But some there are</L>
<L>Conscious of Nature and the rule which man</L>
<L>O'er Nature holds; some who within themselves</L>
<L>Retiring from the trivial scenes of chance</L>
<L>And momentary passion can at will</L>
<L N="75">Call up these fair exemplars of the mind,</L>
<L>Review their features, scan the secret laws</L>
<L>Which bind them to each other, and display</L>
<L>By forms, or sounds, or colours, to the sense</L>
<L>Of all the world, their latent charms display;</L>
<L N="80">Ev'n as in Nature's frame (if such a word,</L>
<L>If such a word, so bold, may from the lips</L>
<L><PB N="190" REF="190"/>
Of man proceed) as in this outward frame</L>
<L>Of things the Great Artificer portrays</L>
<L>His own immense idea. Various names</L>
<L N="85">Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se among mortals bear, as various signs</L>
<L>They use, and by peculiar organs speak</L>
<L>To human sense. There are who by the flight</L>
<L>Of air thro' tubes with moving stops distinct,</L>
<L>Or by extended chords in measure taught</L>
<L N="90">To vibrate, can assemble pow'rful sounds</L>
<L>Expressing ev'ry temper of the mind</L>
<L>From ev'ry cause, and charming all the soul</L>
<L>With passion void of care: others mean-time</L>
<L>The rugged mass of metal, wood, or stone,</L>
<L N="95">Patiently taming, or with easier hand</L>
<L>Describing lines, and with more ample scope</L>
<L>Uniting colours, can to gen'ral sight</L>
<L>Produce those permanent and perfect forms,</L>
<L>Those characters of heroes and of gods,</L>
<L N="100">Which from the crude materials of the world</L>
<L>Their own high minds created. But the chief</L>
<L>Are poets, eloquent men, who dwell on earth</L>
<L>To clothe whate'er the soul admires or loves</L>
<L>With language and with numbers: hence to these</L>
<L N="105">A field is open'd wide as Nature's sphere,</L>
<L>Nay wider; various as the sudden acts</L>
<L>Of human wit, and vast as the demands</L>
<L>Of human will. The bard nor length, nor depth,</L>
<L>Nor place, nor form, controls. To eyes, to ears,</L>
<L N="110">To ev'ry organ of the copious mind,</L>
<L><PB N="191" REF="191"/>
He offereth all its treasures. Him the hours,</L>
<L>The seasons him, obey; and changeful Time</L>
<L>Sees him at will keep measure with his flight,</L>
<L>At will outstrip it. To enhance his toil</L>
<L N="115">He summoneth from th' uttermost extent</L>
<L>Of things which God hath taught him ev'ry form</L>
<L>Auxiliar, ev'ry pow'r, and all beside</L>
<L>Excludes imperious. His prevailing hand</L>
<L>Gives to corporeal essence life and sense,</L>
<L N="120">And ev'ry stately function of the soul.</L>
<L>The soul itself to him obsequious lies,</L>
<L>Like matter's passive heap, and as he wills</L>
<L>To reason and affection he assigns</L>
<L>Their just alliances, their just degrees;</L>
<L N="125">Whence his peculiar honours, whence the race</L>
<L>Of men who people his delightful world,</L>
<L>Men genuine and according to themselves,</L>
<L>Transcend as far th' uncertain sons of earth</L>
<L>As earth itself to his delightful world</L>
<L N="130">The palm of spotless beauty doth resign.</L>
