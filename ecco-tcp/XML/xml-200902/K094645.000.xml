<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE Reader is requested to consider the following Poem as nothing more than what a part of its title-page expresses,—a SKETCH, and only a sketch, of the Social Passion, or Sympathetic Principle, applied, first to the Author's particular situation, and thence ex∣tended more generally, as influencing the whole animal creation.</P>
<P>Upon visiting the Villa of a friend, and finding it deserted by a family extremely dear to the Author, he experienced precisely the sensations he has endeavoured
<PB N="vi" REF="3"/>to describe. It was natural for him to pass beyond his own case, and contemplate that of others under similar circumstances. The fairest productions of animated nature were before him. They occupied the same spot. He was seated in the midst of them. His heart dilated. If, as seems to be admitted, a virtuous enthusiasm be necessary to the proper enjoyment of such scenery, the Critic of Nature will hardly know how to be offended, should he find, that here and there have been indulged effusions, which, if closely examined when the mind is cold, may be sound not altogether in strict con∣nection.</P>
<P>It were easy to have thrown out from the argumenta∣tive parts some sentiments not quite in keeping with the theme; but, zealous to prove the powers of Universal
<PB N="vii" REF="4"/>Sympathy, the writer felt the sollicitudes of an author, united with those of a philanthropist. Of course, the idea of obliterating what had any chance of cementing the social affections was too painful to be adopted.</P>
<P>If, therefore, candour should urge that in stepping occasionally out of his path, his intention has been rather to gather flowers than weeds, he will be forgiven. The poetical licence becomes a matter rather of right than of courtesy, when an author pleads his privi∣lege in the cause of Benevolence. He pretends not to have preserved an exact correspondence between the several members.</P>
<P>Immethodical, however, as the poem confessedly is, the <HI>lucidus ordo</HI> of composition has not been by any means
<PB N="viii" REF="5"/>wantonly discarded; nor ought the Author to conceal (what it is, indeed, his chief pride to acknowledge) the obligations he is under to some of the first and greatest writers in this country, for many valuable hints, of which he has availed himself in the course of the performance.</P>

<L>OE'R you fair lawn, where oft in various talk</L>
<L>The fav'ring Muses join'd our evening walk,</L>
<L>Up yonder hill that rears its crest sublime,</L>
<L>Where we were wont with gradual steps to climb,</L>
<L>To woo the dew-bath'd zephirs on the wing,</L>
<L>And hear the Lark her earliest matin sing;</L>
<L>Fast by you shed, of roots and verdure made,</L>
<L>Where we have paus'd, companions of the shade,</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="7"/>
In yonder cot just seated on the brow,</L>
<L>Whence unobserv'd we view'd the world below;</L>
<L>Whence oft we cull'd fit objects for our song,</L>
<L>From land or ocean largely stretch'd along,</L>
<L>The morning vapours passing through the vale,</L>
<L>The distant turret, or the lessening sail,</L>
<L>The pointed cliff which overhangs the main,</L>
<L>The breezy upland, or the opening plain;</L>
<L>Or down yon foot-way saunter'd by the stream,</L>
<L>Whose little rills ran tinkling to the theme;</L>
<L>More softly touch'd the woe in Hammond's lay,</L>
<L>Or laps'd responsive to the lyre of Gray;</L>
<L>O'er these dear bounds like one forlorn I roam,</L>
<L>O'er these dear bounds, I fondly call'd my home.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And yet to touch me various powers combine,</L>
<L>Here summer revels with a warmth divine;</L>
<L>The bloomy season every charm supplies,</L>
<L>From earth's rich harvest crown'd with cloudless skies,</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="8"/>
Or future plenty bursting through the grain,</L>
<L>From golden sheaves that circle round the swain.</L>
<L>Here as I stop, beneath Eliza's tree,</L>
<L>Far, oh belov'd associate! far from thee,</L>
<L>Some little CHANGE thy absence to declare</L>
<L>I pray to find, and friendship forms the pray'r:</L>
<L>Less bright the sun-beams, or less soft the show'rs,</L>
<L>Some essence wanting to the fruits or flow'rs:</L>
<L>Those fruits and flow'rs, alas! more ripe appear,</L>
<L>And the lawn smiles as though my friend were here;</L>
<L>From the soft myrtle brighter blossoms spring,</L>
<L>In mellower notes the plumy people sing:</L>
<L>Near yonder church where we retir'd to pray,</L>
<L>The good man's modest cottage I survey;</L>
<L>The pious Pastor, who each sabbath taught</L>
<L>The listening rustic's noblest reach of thought:</L>
<L>That modest cottage and its garden still</L>
<L>Seek the soft shelter of the friendly hill;</L>
<L>The column'd smoke still curls its wreathes around,</L>
<L>And not one lessen'd beauty marks the bound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="9"/>
<L>As near you bow'r with pensive steps I go,</L>
<L>To view the shrubs your culture taught to grow,</L>
<L>The fair exotics boast a happier bloom</L>
<L>Than when their patron shar'd the rich perfume:</L>
<L>The orange still its tawny lustre shews</L>
<L>The late rose reddens and the balsam blows;</L>
<L>While roving o'er the hedge the woodbine fair</L>
<L>Embalms with heaven's own essence heaven's own air,</L>
<L>Not softer and not sweeter flew the gale,</L>
<L>When we together trod this blooming vale;</L>
<L>When far beyond the busy world's controul,</L>
<L>Nature our guide, we open'd all the soul.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whence this neglect? say, in thy lov'd domain,</L>
<L>Where all the virtues in thy presence reign;</L>
<L>Where gathering round thee, youth and age conspire,</L>
<L>While some as brother court thee, some as sire;</L>
<L>Where all the social passions softly blend,</L>
<L>To give the similing neighbourhood a friend;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="10"/>
Where somewhat of thy gentle heart is seen,</L>
<L>A grace, or goodness, adding to the green;</L>
<L>Where the babe lisps thy mercies on the knee,</L>
<L>And second childhood leans it's crutch on thee;</L>
<L>Whence this neglect? Ingratitude retreat!</L>
<L>Go: and in shades less sacred fix thy seat:</L>
<L>Go to the treach'rous world, thy proper sphere;</L>
<L>But oh! forbear to scatter poisons here:</L>
<L>About this dwelling and these harmless bounds,</L>
<L>Friendship and Love alone should take their rounds,</L>
<L>Fair as the blossoms which the walls sustain,</L>
<L>Rich as the fruits, and generous as the grain;</L>
<L>Secure as yonder warblers nesting near,</L>
<L>Like Honour steady, and like Faith sincere.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But soft, my friend! tho' shrubs and bow'rs remain</L>
<L>The fix'd productions of th' unconscious plain;</L>
<L>Though these no gentle sympathies can know,</L>
<L>But as the planter bends them learn to grow;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="11"/>
To higher parts as nature lifts her plan,</L>
<L>The kinder creatures, haply, feel for man;</L>
<L>The tame domestics, which attend his board,</L>
<L>Haply partake the fortune of their lord,</L>
<L>His presence hail, his absence long deplore,</L>
<L>Droop as he droops, and die when he's no more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Pleas'd at the thought, still onward let me tread</L>
<L>Where flocks and herds diversify the mead,</L>
<L>Where breathing odours, winnow'd by the gale,</L>
<L>Fan the soft bosom of the smiling vale;</L>
<L>Behind, the rooks their brawling councils hold,</L>
<L>And the proud peacock trails his train of gold;</L>
<L>Around, the doves their purple plumage shew,</L>
<L>And clucking poultry saunter, pleas'd, below;</L>
<L>While there the housedog with accustom'd glee,</L>
<L>Fawns on the hind—and ne'er remembers thee.</L>
<L>These crop the food, those press the flow'ry bed,</L>
<L>Nor weep the absent, nor bewail the dead;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="12"/>
Their stinted feelings seem but half awake,</L>
<L>Dull as you steer now slumbering in the brake.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whence then the gloom that gathers in the sky?</L>
<L>Whence the warm tear now starting to the eye?</L>
<L>Whence then th' apparent change when friends depart?</L>
<L>'Tis FANCY striking on the feeling heart:</L>
<L>'Tis varied Fancy, whose aetherial wand</L>
<L>Bids plastic nature move to her command:</L>
<L>Oh should I follow where <HI>she</HI> leads the way,</L>
<L>What magic meteors to her touch would play!</L>
<L>Far, far from thee, this sun which gilds my brow</L>
<L>In deep eclipse would darken all below:</L>
<L>The herds, though now plain reason sees them feed,</L>
<L>Smit by her touch would languish in the mead;</L>
<L>The breeze which now disports with yonder spray,</L>
<L>The flocks which pant beneath the heats of day,</L>
<L>The pendent copse in passing shadows drest,</L>
<L>The scanty herbage on the mountain's crest,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="13"/>
The balmy pow'rs that essence ev'ry gale,</L>
<L>The glassy lakes that fertilize the dale,</L>
<L>Struck by <HI>her</HI> mystic sceptre all would fade,</L>
<L>And sudden sadness brood along the shade:</L>
<L>Thus Chloe weds, but <HI>she</HI> the garland twines;</L>
<L>Thus Bacchus revels, but <HI>she</HI> twists the vines;</L>
<L>Thus falls a friend, but <HI>she</HI> around the grave</L>
<L>Bids willows whisper, and the cypress wave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As poets sing, thus Fancy takes her range,</L>
<L>Whose fairy fables can the system change.</L>
<L>Soon as the gen'rous master leaves his home,</L>
<L>Behold how thick the alterations come!</L>
<L>Soon as the much-lov'd mistress quits the scene,</L>
<L>The earth, be sure, no longer smiles in green;</L>
<L>In solemn sable ev'ry flow'r appears,</L>
<L>And skies relent in sympathizing tears!</L>
<L>Scarce had the Bard of Leasowes' lov'd domain</L>
<L>Clos'd his dimm'd eye upon the conscious plain;</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="14"/>
Ere birds, and beasts, and hills, and dales, 'tis said,</L>
<L>Mourn'd his sad fate, and funeral honours paid;</L>
<L>His gay parterres a serious habit wore,</L>
<L>His larks wou'd sing, his lambs wou'd frisk no more,</L>
<L>A deeper cadence murmur'd from the floods,</L>
<L>And elegiac sorrow shook his woods:</L>
<L>A solemn dirge the sable raven sung,</L>
<L>The muses wept, their lyres were all unstrung;</L>
<L>But chief his bowers their verdant honours shed,</L>
<L>And ev'ry laurel knew that he was dead.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet separate facts from fairy scenes like these,</L>
<L>Nature, we find, still keeps her first decrees;</L>
<L>The order due which at her birth was giv'n</L>
<L>Still forms th' unchanging law of earth and heav'n,</L>
<L>In one fair tenor, <HI>on</HI> the circle goes,</L>
<L>And no obstruction, no confusion knows.</L>
<L>When Shenstone, nay, when Shakespeare press'd the tomb,</L>
<L>The shrubs that saw their fate maintain'd their bloom;</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="15"/>
Clear ran the streams to their accustom'd shore,</L>
<L>Nor gave one bubble less, one murmur more;</L>
<L>Nor did a single leaf, a simple flower,</L>
<L>Or fade, or fall, to mark their mortal hour.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But, is it Fancy ALL! what, no reserve?</L>
<L>From one dull point can nature never swerve?</L>
<L>Is change of seasons all the change she knows,</L>
<L>From autumn's sickly heats to winter snows;</L>
<L>From chilling spring, to summer's dog-star rage;</L>
<L>From boy to man; from man to crawling age?</L>
<L>These her transitions, ling'ring, sad, and slow,</L>
<L>Whence then, embrac'd by flowers, my bosom's woe?</L>
<L>Ah! is it fancy, that with silent pace,</L>
<L>Impels me thus to range from place to place;</L>
<L>On ev'ry side to see an harvest bend,</L>
<L>Yet look on ev'ry side to find my friend?</L>
<L>Or is it fancy makes the village train,</L>
<L>For now 'tis evening, sport around in vain?</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="16"/>
That plighted pairs, amidst the hazel boughs,</L>
<L>To me unseen, impart their tender vows;</L>
<L>While unsuspicious of a witness near,</L>
<L>They mix with nature's language, nature's tear?</L>
<L>That twilight's gentle grey which now comes on,</L>
<L>To wait, a sober hand-maid, on the sun;</L>
<L>To watch his parting tinge, his soften'd fires,</L>
<L>Then blush with maiden grace as he retires;</L>
<L>The crescent moon which now ascended high,</L>
<L>Her silver mantle throws across the sky;</L>
<L>The still serene that seems to lull the breeze,</L>
<L>Soft in a leafy cradle 'midst the trees;</L>
<L>The lessen'd sound of yonder requiem bell,</L>
<L>With resignation in each mournful knell;</L>
<L>The dropping dew that settles on my cheek,</L>
<L>The frugal lights that from each cottage break;</L>
<L>The just-dropp'd latch, the little lattice clos'd,</L>
<L>To shield from eve's damp air the babe repos'd,</L>
<L>And note the hour when temperance and health</L>
<L>Give the pale vigils of the night to wealth:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="12" REF="17"/>
<L>Say, is it Fancy's vision works the charm,</L>
<L>When these blest objects lose their power to warm?</L>
<L>Ah! no; from other sources springs the smart,</L>
<L>Its source is here, hard pressing on my heart.</L>
<L>Yes, 'tis the heart which rules the roving eye,</L>
<L>And turns a gloomy to a cloudless sky;</L>
<L>The soft magician governs every scene,</L>
<L>Blossoms the rock, or desolates the green;</L>
<L>Along the heath bids fancied roses blow,</L>
<L>And sunshine rise upon a world of snow.</L>
<L>Yes, 'tis the heart endears each smiling plain,</L>
<L>Or to his native mountain binds the swain;</L>
<L>His native mountain where his cottage stands,</L>
<L>More lov'd, more fair, than all the neighb'ring lands;</L>
<L>For though the blast be keen, the soil be bare,</L>
<L>His friends, his wife, his little ones, are there.</L>
<L>Oh, had the brother of <HI>my</HI> heart been nigh,</L>
<L>When morning threw her mantle o'er the sky;</L>
<L>Or when gay noon a gaudier robe display'd,</L>
<L>Or modest ev'ning took her softest shade;</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="18"/>
Then had each shrub breath'd forth its full perfume,</L>
<L>And like the flow'rs the feelings been in bloom:</L>
<L>For still to prove the natal bias right,</L>
<L>The senses with the season must unite.</L>
<L>The bias SOCIAL, man with men must share</L>
<L>The varied benefits of earth and air;</L>
<L>The leading law of life which governs all,</L>
<L>To some in large degrees, to some in small;</L>
<L>To lowest insects, highest pow'rs a part,</L>
<L>Wisely dispens'd to ev'ry beating heart;</L>
<L>To every creature just proportion's giv'n,</L>
<L>From the mole's mansion to the seraph's heav'n.</L>
<L>See the wing'd legions which at noon-tide play,</L>
<L>Together clust'ring in the solar ray,</L>
<L>There sports the social passion; see, and own,</L>
<L>That not an atom takes its flight alone.</L>
<L>Th' unwieldy monsters of the pregnant deep;</L>
<L>The savage troops that through the forest sweep;</L>
<L>The viewless tribes that populate the air;</L>
<L>The milder creatures of domestic care;</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="19"/>
The rooks which rock their infants on the tree;</L>
<L>The race which dip their pinions in the sea;</L>
<L>The feather'd train, gay tenants of the bush,</L>
<L>The glossy blackbird, and the echoing thrush,</L>
<L>The gaudy goldfinch which salutes the spring,</L>
<L>Winnowing the thistle with his burnish'd wing;</L>
<L>Jove's eagle, soaring to you orb of light;</L>
<L>Aurora's lark, and Cynthia's bird of night:</L>
<L>All these the laws of Sympathy declare;</L>
<L>And chorus heav'n's first maxim, BORN TO SHARE.</L>
<L>Instinct, or Sympathy, or what you will,</L>
<L>The social principle is active still;</L>
<L>Of every element it glows the soul,</L>
<L>Touches, pervades, and animates the whole;</L>
<L>Floats in the gale, surrounds earth's wide domain,</L>
<L>Ascends with fire, and dives into the main;</L>
<L>Whilst dull, or bright, the affections know to play,</L>
<L>As full, or feebly, darts this social ray;</L>
<L>Dimly it gleams on insect, fish, and fowl,</L>
<L>But spreads broad sunshine o'er man's favour'd soul.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="15" REF="20"/>
<L>Man's favour'd soul then trace through every state,</L>
<L>And see it fitted for a social fate;</L>
<L>Behold how nature to connection tends,</L>
<L>Each seeks from each his relatives and friends.</L>
<L>You spacious dome which earth and sea commands,</L>
<L>Where Titus dresses his paternal lands;</L>
<L>Where water gushes, and where wood extends,</L>
<L>To share each beauty, Titus calls his friends;</L>
<L>A naked waste, till they adorn his flow'rs,</L>
<L>A desert scene, till they partake his bow'rs:</L>
<L>Nor this, though sweet, the greatest bliss he feels,</L>
<L>That greatest bliss his modesty conceals.</L>
<L>Pass the green slope which bounds his fair domain,</L>
<L>And seek the valley dropping from the plain;</L>
<L>There, in a blossom'd nook, by pomp unseen,</L>
<L>An aged couple lead a life serene;</L>
<L>And there, behind those elms, a sickly pair</L>
<L>Exchange their labours for a softer care:</L>
<L>'Twas Titus gave to sickness this repose,</L>
<L>And plac'd life's second cradle near the rose;</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="21"/>
In his own hall though louder joys prevail,</L>
<L>A dearer transport whispers from the vale;</L>
<L>Though mirth and frolic echo through the dome:</L>
<L>In those small cots his bosom finds a home.</L>
<L>Fame, fortune, friends, can providence give more?</L>
<L>Go, ask of heav'n the blessings of the poor!</L>
<L>A greater comfort would you still supply?</L>
<L>Then wipe the tear from sorrow's streaming eye;</L>
<L>For social kindness to another shewn,</L>
<L>Expands the bliss to make it more your own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Lo! the rude savage, naked and untaught,</L>
<L>Shares with his mate what arts and arms have caught;</L>
<L>When winter darkness clouds his long, long night,</L>
<L>See how he strives to find the social light;</L>
<L>His woodland wife, his forest children dear,</L>
<L>Smooth the bleak storms that sadden half his year.</L>
<L>For them he tracks the monster in the snow;</L>
<L>For them he hurls his sling, and twangs his bow;</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="22"/>
Nor scorching sunshine, nor the driving show'r,</L>
<L>The vollied thunder, nor the light'ning's pow'r,</L>
<L>Nor climes, where sickness pants in every breeze,</L>
<L>Nor worlds of ice, where nature seems to freeze,</L>
<L>Checks the fair principle, which bursts away,</L>
<L>Like Sol when clouds attempt his noon-tide ray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hence, ever lean the feeble on the strong,</L>
<L>As tender sires their children lead along;</L>
<L>While, by degrees, as transient life declines,</L>
<L>And florid youth to withering age resigns,</L>
<L>The social passion shifts with place and time,</L>
<L>And tender sires are led by sons in prime;</L>
<L>The guide becomes the guided in his turn,</L>
<L>While child and parent different duties learn.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not then from fancy only, from the heart,</L>
<L>Pours the keen anguish on th' immortal part,</L>
<L>And truth herself destroys the bloom of May,</L>
<L>When death or fortune tears a friend away;</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="23"/>
From virtuous passion, virtuous feeling flows,</L>
<L>The grief that dims the lilly and the rose.</L>
<L>Drops a soft sorrow for a friend in dust?</L>
<L>There, truth and fancy both may rear the bust;</L>
<L>While one pours forth the tribute of the heart,</L>
<L>The other plies her visionary art,</L>
<L>Potent she calls her airy spectres round,</L>
<L>And bids them instant consecrate the ground;</L>
<L>In magic circles, lo, the illusions come,</L>
<L>To shroud the earth in monumental gloom;</L>
<L>Fancy presides as sov'reign of the scene,</L>
<L>And dark is every leaf of every green;</L>
<L>Whilst reason loves to mix with her's the tear,</L>
<L>And the fair mourners form a league sincere;</L>
<L>Her airy visions, fancy may impart,</L>
<L>And reason listen to the charmer's art.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In life's fair morn, I knew an aged seer,</L>
<L>Who sad and lonely past his joyless year;</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="24"/>
Betray'd, heart-broken, from the world he ran,</L>
<L>And shunn'd, oh dire extreme, the face of man;</L>
<L>Humbly he rear'd his hut within the wood,</L>
<L>Hermit his beard, a hermit's was his food,</L>
<L>Nitch'd in some corner where the gelid caves</L>
<L>With chilling drops the rugged rockstone laves;</L>
<L>Hour after hour, the melancholy sage,</L>
<L>Drop after drop to reckon, would engage</L>
<L>The ling'ring day, and trickling as they fell,</L>
<L>A tear went with them to the narrow well.</L>
<L>Then thus he moraliz'd as slow it past,</L>
<L>"This, brings me nearer Lucia than the last;</L>
<L>"And this, now streaming from the eye," said he,</L>
<L>"Oh, my lov'd child, will bring me nearer thee."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When first he roam'd, his dog with anxious care,</L>
<L>His wandring's watch'd, as emulous to share;</L>
<L>In vain the faithful brute was bid to go,</L>
<L>Vain sought the sage a solitary woe;</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="25"/>
The pilgrim paus'd, th' attendant dog was near,</L>
<L>Slept at his feet, and caught the falling tear;</L>
<L>Up rose the pilgrim, up the dog would rise,</L>
<L>And every way to win a master tries.</L>
<L>"Then be it so. Come, faithful fool," he said;</L>
<L>One pat encourag'd, and they sought the shade;</L>
<L>An unfrequented thicket soon they found,</L>
<L>And both repos'd upon the leafy ground;</L>
<L>Mellifluous murm'rings told the fountains nigh,</L>
<L>Fountains, which well a pilgrim's drink supply.</L>
<L>And thence, by many a labyrinth it led,</L>
<L>Where ev'ry tree bestow'd an evening bed;</L>
<L>Skill'd in the chace the faithful creature brought</L>
<L>Whate'er at morn or moon-light course he caught;</L>
<L>But softest pity gave the sage to all,</L>
<L>Nor saw unwept his dumb associates fall.</L>
<L>He was, in sooth, the gentlest of his kind,</L>
<L>And though a hermit had a social mind:</L>
<L>"And why, said he, must man subsist by prey,</L>
<L>"Why stop you melting music on the spray?</L>

"Why, when assail'd by hounds and hunter's cry,</L>
<L>"Must half the harmless race in terror fly?</L>
<L>"Why must we work of innocence the woe?</L>
<L>"Still shall this bosom throb, these eyes o'erflow.</L>
<L>"A heart too tender, here from man retires,</L>
<L>"A heart that aches if but a wren expires."</L>
<L>Thus liv'd the master good, the servant true,</L>
<L>Till to its God the master's spirit flew;</L>
<L>Beside a fount which daily water gave,</L>
<L>Stooping to drink, the pilgrim found a grave;</L>
<L>All in the running stream his garments spread,</L>
<L>And dark, damp verdure ill conceal'd his head;</L>
<L>Crouch'd in the water the survivor stood,</L>
<L>Sick'ning with sorrow, and rejecting food,</L>
<L>The faithful servant from that fatal day</L>
<L>Watch'd the lov'd corpse and piteous pin'd away;</L>
<L>Five nights he fill'd the forest with his moan,</L>
<L>Five nights he join'd the passing spectre's groan;</L>
<L>At length the screech-owl flapping, boded death,</L>

His head upon his master's cheek was found,</L>
<L>While the obstructed waters mourn'd around.</L>

<L>But sordid souls are ever in distress,</L>
<L>To bless himself each must a second bless;</L>
<L>Then kindle on till he the world embrace,</L>
<L>And in love's Caestus gird the human race.</L>
<L>Thus social grief can finer joys impart</L>
<L>Than the dull pleasures of a miser heart:</L>
<L>Thus with more force can melancholy warm,</L>

<L>The SOCIAL PRINCIPLE resumes the shade,</L>

<L>See how it pants, my friend, in yonder throng,</L>

While heav'n's warm beams upon her bosom dart,</L>

<L>Or catch the burthen of the reaper's song;</L>

<L>Cling to the gown, half pleas'd, and half afraid;</L>
<L>While he who gave them life looks on the while,</L>
<L>And views his little houshold with a smile;</L>
<L>Imprints the kiss, then blessing ev'ry birth,</L>
<L>Carols his joy, and cultivates the earth.</L>

<L>But not to scenes of peasantry confin'd,</L>

The views which stretch beyond the western main,</L>
<L>And mark the district of a diff'rent plain;</L>
<L>Not circumscrib'd to these the social plan,</L>
<L>Which more extends, as more pursu'd by man.</L>
<L>Just as you path-way, winding through the mead,</L>
<L>Grows broad and broader by perpetual tread,</L>
<L>The social passion turns the foot aside,</L>
<L>And prompts the swains to travel side by side;</L>
<L>Both edge, by turns, upon the bord'ring sod,</L>
<L>And the path widens as the grass is trod.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In cities thus, though trade's tumultuous train</L>
<L>Spurn at the homely maxims of the plain,</L>
<L>Not all the toss of rank, the trick of art,</L>
<L>Can chase the social passion from the heart:</L>
<L>Nay more, a larger circle it must take,</L>
<L>Where men embodying, larger int'rests make,</L>
<L>And each perforce round each more closely twine,</L>
<L>Where thousands lean their weight upon the line.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="28" REF="33"/>
<L>As slow to yonder eminence I bend,</L>
<L>Gradual the views of social life extend,</L>
<L>Where benches soften the ascent I stray,</L>
<L>And stop at each to take a just survey;</L>
<L>At ev'ry step, as sinks the vale behind,</L>
<L>A wider prospect opens on mankind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Far to the lest where those blue hills arise,</L>
<L>And bathe their swelling bosoms in the skies;</L>
<L>The barks of commerce set the flapping sail,</L>
<L>And the dark sea-boy sues the busy gale;</L>
<L>There the deep warehouse shews its native store,</L>
<L>And there flame riches of a foreign shore;</L>
<L>Thick swarm the sons of trade on every hand,</L>
<L>And either India breathes along the strand:</L>
<L>Gold, give me gold, each bustler cries aloud,</L>
<L>As hope or fear alternate seize the croud;</L>
<L>To careless eyes the love of pelf alone,</L>
<L>Seems to drain off the golden tide for one;</L>
<L><PB N="29" REF="34"/>
But closer view'd a various course it takes,</L>
<L>And wide meanderings in its passage makes;</L>
<L>Through many a social channel see it run,</L>
<L>And carry plenty down from sire to son;</L>
<L>From thence in many a mazy stream it flows,</L>
<L>And feels no ebb, nor dull stagnation knows;</L>
<L>Gain, pleasure, passion, property, induce</L>
<L>Each single man to study general use.</L>
<L>Thus nature and necessity agree</L>
<L>The social chain to stretch from land to sea.</L>
<L>Thus e'en the miser opes his sordid soul,</L>
<L>Loves but himself, and yet befriends the whole.</L>
<L>Ask you a stronger proof? Place wealth alone;</L>
<L>With some hard niggard lock up all his own;</L>
<L>Pile bills, and bags, and bonds, upon his shelf,</L>
<L>And a close prisoner chain him to his pelf.</L>
<L>Unhappy man! from family and friends,</L>

<L>From touch of kindred, tune of tender speech,</L>

How would he sigh his station to regain,</L>
<L>And buy a glance at man with half his gain!</L>

<L>Far happier he, who breasting ev'ry wind,</L>
<L>Lives on the common mercy of his kind,</L>
<L>Who roams the world to tell his piteous case,</L>
<L>And dies at last amidst the human race.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye friends to self, ye worshippers of gold,</L>
<L>Who deem a passion lavish'd if unsold;</L>
<L>Who farm the principles with statesman's art,</L>
<L>And like a us'rer traffick with the heart:</L>
<L>Who to that idol in its nich confine</L>
<L>The holy incense due at nature's shrine;</L>
<L>Say, can your sordid merchandize deny</L>
<L>The sacred force of heav'n-born Sympathy?</L>
<L>Ah, no! the gen'rous spirit takes a part,</L>
<L>As goodness, glory, pity, move the heart.</L>
<L><PB N="31" REF="36"/>
Else, why at ev'ry virtue do we glow?</L>
<L>Else, why at sorrow do the eyes o'erflow?</L>
<L>Why with the fabled hero do we bleed,</L>
<L>And scorn the base, and love the gen'rous deed?</L>
<L>Why ev'ry turn of fortune do we share,</L>
<L>As with old Homer's chiefs we rush to war?</L>
<L>Why with the wife of Hector do we mourn,</L>
<L>Weep with poor Priam, with Achilles burn?</L>
<L>Attentive hear Apollo's priest complain,</L>
<L>Or join our griefs for good Patroclus slain?</L>
<L>Spite of your arts the sympathies arise,</L>
<L>And aid the cause of all the brave and wise;</L>
<L>Spite of your little selves, when virtue charms,</L>
<L>To nature true, the social passion warms;</L>
<L>Vain to resist, imperial nature still</L>
<L>Asserts her claim, and bends us to her will.</L>

Above, below, its genial splendours play,</L>
<L>Where'er an human footstep marks the way.</L>
<L>"Oh, for one trace of man upon the snow,</L>
<L>"The track of sweet society to shew;</L>
<L>"Oh, for one print on swarthy Afric's shore!"</L>
<L>Thus prays the wanderer scap'd from ocean's roar;</L>
<L>In every clime is felt the throb divine,</L>
<L>By land, by water, here, and at the Line.</L>

<LG>
<L>Nor Climates only, for each Age imparts</L>
<L>The kindly bias to our social hearts;</L>
<L>See the swath'd infant cling to the embrance,</L>
<L>And feel instinctive fondness for its race;</L>
<L>See it, ascending, strengthen as it grows,</L>
<L>Till ripe and riper the affection glows,</L>
<L>Then view the child, its toys and trinkets share,</L>

<L>As Age advances, some sensations cease,</L>

<L>Self-love creeps closest to the social power;</L>
<L>The stooping veteran of the silver hair</L>

<L>His goodly sons and daughters standing by,</L>
<L>To the lisp'd tale he bends the greedy ear,</L>
<L>And o'er his children's children drops a tear;</L>
<L>Or, every friend surviv'd, himself half dead,</L>

<L>As front to front the warring parties meet,</L>
<L>For social ends they dare the martial feat;</L>
<L>As breast to breast, and eye to eye they fix,</L>
<L>For social ends they separate or mix.</L>
<L>King, country, parents, children, prompt the fight,</L>

<L>Affection sought from Power the wish'd relief</L>

<L>To wield the battle-axe, or lift the blade;</L>

<L>But these, alas! his first essays to swim;</L>
<L>Attempt, how vain! full wild the waters rose,</L>
<L>And o'er their heads in circling surges close,</L>
<L>He grasps the damsel struggling with the wave,</L>
<L>Till both untimely find a wat'ry grave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And lives the man, oh Nature, tell me where,</L>
<L>Whose rebel bosom knows no triumph here;</L>
<L><PB N="45" REF="50"/>
Whose coward cheek no tinge of honour feels,</L>
<L>Flush'd with no pride at what the Muse reveals?</L>
<L>Lives there, who all unconscious could have stood</L>
<L>To see the victim buffet with the flood?</L>
<L>If such a man, if such a wretch there be,</L>
<L>Thanks to this aching heart, I am not he.</L>
</LG>

<L>Hail, lovely griefs, in tender mercy giv'n,</L>
<L>And hail, ye tears, like dew-drops fresh from heav'n;</L>
<L>Hail, balmy breath of unaffected sighs,</L>
<L>More sweet than airs that ventilate the skies;</L>
<L>Hail, sacred source of sympathies divine,</L>
<L>Thine ev'ry social pulse, each fibre thine;</L>
<L>Hail, symbols of the God to whom we owe</L>
<L>The nerves that vibrate, and the hearts that glow;</L>
<L>Love's tender tumult, friendship's holy fires,</L>
<L>And all which beauty, all which worth inspires,</L>
<L>The joy that lights the hope-illumin'd eye,</L>
<L>The bliss supreme that melts in pity's sigh,</L>
<L>Affection's bloom quick rushing to the face,</L>
<L>The choice acknowledg'd and the warm embrace:</L>
<L><PB N="46" REF="51"/>
Oh power of powers, whose magic thus can draw</L>
<L>Earth, air, and ocean, by one central law,</L>
<L>Join bird to bird, to insect insect link,</L>
<L>From those which grovel up to those which think;</L>
<L>Oh, ever blest! whose bounties opening wide</L>
<L>Fill the vast globe, for mortals to divide,</L>
<L>Whose heavenly favours stretch from pole to pole,</L>
<L>Encircle earth, and rivet soul to soul!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Cease then to wonder these lov'd scenes impart</L>
<L>No more the usual transport to my heart;</L>
<L>Though modest Twilight visit Eve again,</L>
<L>At whose soft summons homeward steps the swain;</L>
<L>Though from the breath of oxen in the vale,</L>
<L>I catch the spirit of the balmy gale,</L>
<L>And from the brakes the answering thrushes sing,</L>
<L>While the grey owl sails by on solemn wing;</L>
<L>Nor wonder, if when morning blooms again,</L>
<L>In discontent I quit the flowery plain.</L>

<L>Thus the poor mariner, his traffick o'er,</L>
<L>Crouds ev'ry sail to reach his native shore,</L>
<L>With smiles he marks the pennons stream to port,</L>
<L>And climbs the top-most mast to eye the fort;</L>
<L>Dim through the mist the distant land appears,</L>
<L>And far he slopes to hail it with his tears;</L>
<L>From foreign regions, foreign faces, come,</L>
<L>Anxious he seeks his much-lov'd friends at home,</L>
<L>Warm, and more warm, the social passion glows,</L>
<L>As near and nearer to the place he goes;</L>
<L>Quick beats his heart as pressing on he sees</L>
<L>His own fair cottage canopy'd with trees;</L>
<L>For there, in blessed health, he hopes to find</L>
<L>His wife and cradled infant left behind;</L>
<L>Panting, he plucks the latch that guards the door,</L>
<L>But finds his wife, his cradled babe, no more!</L>
<L>Like some sad ghost he wanders o'er the green,</L>
<L>Droops on the blossom'd waste, and loaths the scene.</L>

<L>Yet haply you, by SYMPATHY, may know</L>
<L>That here a-while I paus'd to paint my woe,</L>
<L>For sure if ever Silph or Silphid bore</L>
<L>One true friend's message to a distant shore;</L>
<L>If ever spirit whisper'd gentle deed,</L>
<L>In such an absence most its aid we need.</L>
<L>Perhaps, for now let fancy take her flight,</L>
<L>My friend, like me, may wander through the night,</L>
<L>Amidst a different scenery may roam,</L>
<L>And many a gentle sigh address to home;</L>
<L>Ev'n now, where moon-beams tremble on the wave,</L>
<L>And circling seagulls their long pinions lave,</L>
<L>Where anchor'd vessels in the harbour ride,</L>
<L>To wait the flux of the returning tide,</L>
<L>Where the salt billow beats against the strand,</L>
<L>My friend may take his solitary stand;</L>
<L>Or on the rock projecting to the main</L>
<L>May sit him down to mark the social strain,</L>
<L>Along the frothing beach may bend his way,</L>
<L>And suit, like me, his sorrows to his lay.</L>

<L>FAREWELL, my hour approaches with the dawn,</L>
<L>And up I spring to leave the flowery lawn;</L>
<L>The pain increases as I stay to trace</L>
<L>Another sunshine rising o'er the place:</L>
<L>Adieu then, balmy shrubs and shades, adieu,</L>
<L>This passing incense o'er your leaves I strew;</L>
<L>Adieu, thou dear and hill-screen'd cottage fair;</L>
<L>Adieu, thou decent dome of Sunday prayer;</L>
<L>To each, to all, adieu; your lonely guest</L>
<L>Retires. The SOCIAL PASSION speaks the rest.</L>
