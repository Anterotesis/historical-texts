<P>Mr. O'Keeffee owes his first Thought of writing this Piece, to a Circumstance he had heard of a Cen∣tinel quitting his Post, to follow the Detachment from the Guards when it embarked at Greenwich: But whether a Fact, or Fiction, he is happy if it has af∣forded any Pleasure from the Popularity of the Occa∣sion, the sweet Melodies of Mr. Shield, and the zealous Exertion of the respective Performers.</P>

<P>Major, I never was disgrac'd with irons, or in a jail.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tactic.</SPEAKER>
<P>Zounds! Mary, what story's this you've been telling us? Oh! I see it's all a slam, an excuse for her coming after us to Greenwich, and taking another parting kiss with your sweet∣heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mary.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(cries)</STAGE>
<P>Indeed, father, I don't know what you mean; Lenox now, has got other cloaths on—but I'm sure I saw him taken into custody, prisoner by the Corporal—Think me— <STAGE>(sobs)</STAGE> so—artful—as—to—invent stories—only—to—compass—my—own—pleasure! <STAGE>(sobs)</STAGE></P>

<P>Why, did you pull him from behind the hen-coop?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Corp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hen-coop! Oh! you have been taking your drops! I say, I found Lenox on his guard most damnably disguised.</P>

<P>Nipperkin! Oh! I see how this has been.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I'll have justice—they took my keg. <STAGE>(looks at Lenox)</STAGE> What, then you have been doing it? I thought so—and taken—I desire he mayn't be hang'd in my coat.</P>

<STAGE>Nipperkin talks apart to sailors.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(To Lenox)</STAGE> Young man, I've laid your case before his Royal Highness—tho' your quit∣ing your post was a crime, that demands from military discipline, a severe punishment; yet, in
<PB N="43" REF="48"/>
consideration of your laudable motive, a brilliant example of noble ardour for your country's honor, he not only pardons you, but from your high character as an excellent soldier, presents you with this purse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nip.</SPEAKER>
<P>A purse for only swimming to—by the lord, I once swam from Chelsea-reach to Battersea bridge—give me.—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nip.</SPEAKER>
<P>A hen-coop! zounds to smuggie myself into a fight I'd hide behind a mouse trap.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lenox.</SPEAKER>
<P>I humbly thank his Highness—pardon is the utmost grace I cou'd hope for—my friend <STAGE>(to Sinclair)</STAGE> you have never disobeyed orders—a more finished soldier, on the eve of being mar∣ried too—and the Prince's bounty will be applied to a better purpose in contributing additional comforts to an amiable woman. <STAGE>(gives purse to Sinclair.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nip.</SPEAKER>
<P>Zounds! they won't let me be generous—nobody'll give me purses to give away to poor families.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lenox.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, if I am only suffered but to go with my Prince, some future event may offer an occasion, really to signalize myself, and by merit win a reward, of which, I am now totally un∣worthy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>A liberal minded fellow, faith! so, my lass, this your soldier laddie!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mary.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, no, sir—I grant he deserves—ay, the most beautiful lady—but here's my humble choice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sinclair.</SPEAKER>
<P>Humble, indeed! yet I have reason to be proud with the friendship of Lenox, and the love of Mary.</P>

<SPEAKER>Nip.</SPEAKER>
<P>Captain, lend me a guinea, I'll tell you a secret.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>You drunken scoundrel, I'll break your head.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nip.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I'can't return the compliment till you get one to break, <STAGE>(aside)</STAGE> This boy's genero∣sity has so wrought upon my heart, that I can't bear he should longer remain in this obscure wretchedness—hearky <STAGE>(to Lenox)</STAGE> down on your knees to the codger, <STAGE>(points to the Captain)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lenox.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nip.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! what is this world come to! I bid a son ask his father's blessing, and he says holloa! death and ouns, what do you mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Son! this—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lenox.</SPEAKER>
<P>How!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nip.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you, that's the boy in the basket, the child of charity, the prentice to—Mr. Da∣rumple, the fiddle-case maker; the private soldier, that for glory prefers a French bullet to an Eng∣lish plumb-pudding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lenox.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, my birth has been a mystery—and is it thus explained?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>It must be the deserted son—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nip.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of an abandon'd father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nipperkin, you're now privileged—The service you've rendered me by this discovery—my boy a brave soldier!—must make a good officer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lenox.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, my highest ambition is now to par∣take the glories of the enterprize as a private, for if I am to be honour'd with promotion I'll first with the heart, hand and ardour of a British Soldier endeavour to deserve it.</P>
