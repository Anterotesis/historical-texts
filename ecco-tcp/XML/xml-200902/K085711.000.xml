<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE Earl of <HI>SCARSDALE.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have long had an eager Am∣bition to see Your Lordship's Name amongst those Noble <HI>Patrons,</HI> to whom I have presum'd to offer my unworthy Attempts in Poetry. I acknowledge, I want Me∣rit infinitely in all these Underta∣kings, and am so Humble, to own
<PB REF="3"/>
more Faults than the severest <HI>Critick</HI> will give himself the Trouble to find; yet such has been my Good Fortune, that I have often found In∣dulgeance from the Greatest and Best of our Kingdom: This, in Part, mitigates my Fears, when I Ven∣ture to approach Your Lordship with so worthless a Piece.</P>
<P>I have the Honour to know Your Lordship so well, as to de∣pend on Your Goodness, when I am afraid of Your Judgment, to believe you so kind and forgiving, as to smile at Follies, that have no other Intention than Your inno∣cent Diversion. After having con∣fess'd the Weakness of my Pen, I may be justly excus'd from Aiming
<PB REF="4"/>
at a Character generous as Your Lordships, and shining with those Heroick Qualities, which ought to be inherent to the Great; nor let the severest Moralist Reflect upon the Incouragement of Things of this Nature, since the noblest Lives Fame has transmitted to Posterity, have always been <HI>Patrons,</HI> of Poe∣try.</P>
<P>May Your Lordship long con∣tinue in that State of Happiness Your Noble Birth and Fortunes have fixed You, and Master of those excellent Indowments, Justice and Humanity, with that unalter∣able Firmness to Your Word and Principle. These Virtues, My Lord, render You, the Ornament
<PB REF="5"/>
of the Nation and Nobility; and in Your unbending Hours, may You still remain a Favourer of the Stage, and vouchsafe, to listen to the unartful Numbers of this Poem, and be inclind to pardon the Da∣ring Boldness of Inscribing it to Your Lordship, by,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE> <SIGNED>Your Lordship's most Obedient and Humble Servant,</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>VIOLENTA FROM BOCCACE</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>BEGIN my Muse, the wondrous Tale re∣herse,</L>
<L>The various Turns of Virtue in Distress.</L>
<L>How Fate controuls the Council of the Wise,</L>
<L>How often hid in Beauties fair Disguise,</L>
<L>Foul Deceit and treacherous Falshood Lies.</L>
<L>How Virtue breaks the dark'ning Clouds away,</L>
<L>And from Misfortunes Night <HI>arises gay,</HI></L>
<L>Gives double Lustre to the glorious Day.</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="8"/>
Here may the Old a mighty Pattern find,</L>
<L>And view the Trial of the noblest Mind;</L>
<L>Soft Love to please the chearful happy Young,</L>
<L>With strange Adventures fills th' Historick Song.</L>
<L>'Twas in those warlike Days, when growing <HI>France</HI></L>
<L>Would with extending Power her Realms advance:</L>
<L>The Sturdy <HI>Germans,</HI> late the <HI>Roman</HI> Pride,</L>
<L>Still struggl'd hard, still push'd and gor'd her Side;</L>
<L>Vast Troops they rais'd, the King and Prince their Head,</L>
<L>Fill'd with their Youth, and by their Heroes led;</L>
<L>This done, there follows and important Care,</L>
<L>Whom they shall trust, their great Vicegerent here.</L>
<L>The <HI>Dauphin</HI> to his Father recommends</L>
<L>One of his dearest, most deserving Friends,</L>
<L>The Count of <HI>Angiers,</HI> then in high Renown,</L>
<L>Fittest to guard and fill the empty Throne.</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="9"/>
The Choice with universal Joy's approv'd,</L>
<L>Never was Man like Noble <HI>Angiers</HI> lov'd.</L>
<L>Against his Will the Mourner's drawn to Court,</L>
<L>Who had forsook the World and all Resort;</L>
<L>To the dark Groves and silent Caves was fled</L>
<L>To weep in vain, his dear <HI>Maria</HI> dead;</L>
<L>For Tyrant Death had snatch'd a Faithful Wife,</L>
<L>And with her all the Joys of hapless <HI>Angiers</HI> Life;</L>
<L>The World to him had now no pleasing Charms,</L>
<L>Nor wak'd he with the once lov'd Sound of Arms:</L>
<L>Thus liv'd the Count to eating Grief a Prey,</L>
<L>'Till by his Master's Voice he's forc'd away,</L>
<L>He heard, and knew he must the King obey.</L>
<L>He comes, and soon the mighty Charge receives,</L>
<L>And for his Trust his Faith and Honour gives;</L>
<L>And now the <HI>Dauphin</HI> ready to depart,</L>
<L>Presses his faithful <HI>Angiers</HI> to his Heart:</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="10"/>
Oh! thou my Dear and long try'd Friend he said!</L>
<L>And on his Bosom kindly lean'd his Head,</L>
<L>To thee my Father leaves his Kingdom's Care,</L>
<L>No Subject boasts of Pow'r a larger Share:</L>
<L>The Trust is weighty, and the Trouble great,</L>
<L>To Rule this potent Land and Pop'lar State;</L>
<L>Yet my best Friend there is more Business yet.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I must ingage thy most peculiar Care,</L>
<L>To guard and please that bright Illustrious Fair,</L>
<L>My charming Wife, whose far fam'd Beauty may,</L>
<L>While I to distant Camps am call'd away,</L>
<L>By some ill Fate, my Peace at Home betray.</L>
<L>Watch that <HI>Cleora</HI> undisturb'd may rest,</L>
<L>In serving her thou gain'st thy Master's Breast:</L>
<L>This said, he clasp'd him fast, nor staid Replies,</L>
<L>But cry'd, I read thy Answer in thy Eyes.</L>
<L>Quick to his warlike Troops he took his Way,</L>
<L>Whose youthful Heat cou'd brook no longer stay.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="11"/>
<HI>Angiers</HI> is left the sole Commander now,</L>
<L>To him the officious Courtiers crowd and bow;</L>
<L>He look'd as born to the Honours of his Place,</L>
<L>His Noble Soul enrich'd with every Grace,</L>
<L>Shone with Majestick Sweetness in his Face.</L>
<L>Just ripen'd full from Youths delightful Bloom,</L>
<L>Enough to promise happy Years to come;</L>
<L>With most judicious Policy he Reigns,</L>
<L>Supports the Good, the Bad his Pow'r restrains;</L>
<L>Remembring well his Master's last Command,</L>
<L>He Signs all Orders with <HI>Cleora</HI>'s Hand.</L>
<L><HI>Cleora</HI> bright as the approaching Day,</L>
<L>When Fair <HI>Aurora</HI> does her Beams display</L>
<L>And gilds the Mountains with her blooming Ray.</L>
<L>In her ten Thousand Graces Revelling meet,</L>
<L>The blowing Rose not half so lovely sweet:</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="12"/>
She look'd as if her Eyes commanded Fate,</L>
<L>Form'd equal to her Great Imperial State,</L>
<L>Yet on her Soul a yielding Softness sate;</L>
<L>And Noble <HI>Angiers</HI> was her chiefest Care,</L>
<L>On him she smil'd with a familiar Air;</L>
<L>Try'd every way that might his Griefs redress,</L>
<L>Oblige the Count (and make that Passion less)</L>
<L>With all Delights that Prudence could afford,</L>
<L>Or <HI>Pallace</HI> yield in th' Absence of its Lord.</L>
<L>Sometimes with Rural Sports they'd chase the Hind,</L>
<L>Whose nimble Feet seem to outstrip the Wind;</L>
<L>Then Dancing, Balls, and Masquerades and Plays,</L>
<L>With these they wast the Nights and chearful Days;</L>
<L>With these Delights <HI>Cleora</HI> kindly strove</L>
<L>To drive from <HI>Angiers</HI> Breast all former Love;</L>
<L>Abroad they prosper, Couriers daily bring</L>
<L>News of Success both by the Prince and King.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="13"/>
Now in the height of Bliss, just <HI>Angiers</HI> stood</L>
<L>Supreamly Great, and more supreamly Good:</L>
<L>Yet short the Joys which humane Souls allure,</L>
<L>Nor can we make our Happiness secure;</L>
<L>Vain Man as well on Sand may Structures lay,</L>
<L>As hope to fix his Fate in mould'ring Clay;</L>
<L>A Thousand Accidents frail Life attend,</L>
<L>And Mortals only know that Life must end;</L>
<L>Our Paths seem hid in the dark Book of Fate,</L>
<L>The Doom once past, Precaution comes too late;</L>
<L>So luckless <HI>Angiers,</HI> Thoughtful Bold and Wise,</L>
<L>Esteem'd his Court another Paradice;</L>
<L>Yet to his Cost, the Noble Heroe found</L>
<L>Ten Thousand Snakes beneath th' enamell'd Ground:</L>
<L>Had he foreseen his Fate, tho' but in Dreams,</L>
<L>He must have dy'd at Terrour of the Scenes,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="14"/>
Which thus began; <HI>Cleora</HI> Orders sends</L>
<L>To th' Count her Councellor, and best of Friends,</L>
<L>To her Appartment he must straight repair,</L>
<L>For Business of Importance waits him there.</L>
<L>With hast, and Loyal Zeal, the Victim came,</L>
<L>Dress'd like Loves Goddess was the princely Dame,</L>
<L>Her Eyes had equal Brightness, equal Flame;</L>
<L>Her Mantle Azure, fill'd with Stars of Gold,</L>
<L>And shining Jems adorn'd each curious Fold;</L>
<L>Careless thrown, scarce cover'd half her Breast;</L>
<L>But to the wond'ring Eye expos'd the rest:</L>
<L>Choice Garlands crown'd her lovely flowing Hair,</L>
<L>Yet seem to lose their Lustre planted there,</L>
<L>The Rose not half so fresh, the Lilly half so fair.</L>
<L>Supinely on a glorious Couch she lay</L>
<L>As she wou'd Rival the bright Lamp of Day;</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="15"/>
Her Head she lean'd upon her snowy Hand,</L>
<L>Whilst <HI>Angiers</HI> kneels to hear her dread Com∣mand;</L>
<L>The bright attending Nymphs that round her wait,</L>
<L>Retire, not pry into Affairs of State:</L>
<L>When thus the charming Princess Silence broke,</L>
<L>And with a Smile to faithful <HI>Angiers</HI> spoke,</L>
<L>Arise my Noble Lord, and seat you there,</L>
<L>For I have much to say, and you must hear;</L>
<L>You once did feel great Love's Tyranick Reign,</L>
<L>And sure must kindly Sigh when I complain;</L>
<L>The <HI>Dauphin</HI> writes, the Wars will take much Time,</L>
<L>And me neglected leaves in Beauties Prime,</L>
<L>Hard Fate! a Sacrifice to publick Voice,</L>
<L>I never knew the Priveledge of Choice;</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="16"/>
When in my Father's Court, the wond'ring Croud</L>
<L>Still gaz'd, and Poets sung my Praises loud;</L>
<L>They haild my Youth, and wish'd me all Delights,</L>
<L>But I'm condemn'd to care, and widdow'd Nights:</L>
<L>The sad Reverse of all their Blessings prove,</L>
<L>And must conclude the <HI>Dauphin</HI> does not love.</L>
<L>The flattering World, and each reflecting Glass,</L>
<L>Owns matchless Glory's in this injur'd Face;</L>
<L>Forgive me if I break our Sexes Laws,</L>
<L>When wrong'd, we may assert our Right, our Cause.</L>
<L>Speak <HI>Angiers,</HI> were I circled in thy Arms,</L>
<L>Wou'dst thou for Camps forsake Loves softer Charms?</L>
<L>Up to her Cheeks a conscious Blush straight flies,</L>
<L>And thousand Cupids revell'd in her Eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Angiers</HI> arose, with Reverence profound</L>
<L>Began, nor rais'd his fix'd Eyes from the Ground:</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="17"/>
Most Divine Princess, you may rest assur'd,</L>
<L>You are the Treasure of your absent Lord;</L>
<L>By Glory torn from Loves delightful Chains,</L>
<L>Yet in his Heart alone <HI>Cleora</HI> Reigns:</L>
<L>Oh! had you heard the tender Charge he gave</L>
<L>Of you (his Lifes Reward) to me his Slave,</L>
<L>You never cou'd his Constancy suspect,</L>
<L>But call that Violence which now you term Neg∣lect.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Scarce cou'd the Fair her soft Confusion hide,</L>
<L>And half compos'd, she blushing thus reply'd,</L>
<L>To <HI>Angiers</HI> then did he <HI>Cleora</HI> leave?</L>
<L>For that one Act I all his Faults forgive.</L>
<L>To <HI>Angiers</HI> freely I my self resign,</L>
<L>Too sure I'm his, Heaven make the Heroe mine:</L>
<L>What racking Fires are these that fill my Breast,</L>
<L>My Soul distract, and rob my Eyes of Rest!</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="18"/>
Oh! turn not from me, since too much I've said,</L>
<L>And the soft Secret of my Soul betray'd:</L>
<L>If I'm refus'd, Death is the Punishment.</L>
<L>But Love and Pleasure wait on kind Consent.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Down at her Feet the trembling <HI>Angiers</HI> fell,</L>
<L>His Terrour and Surprize no Tongue can tell</L>
<L>His Faulters, not knows which way to begin,</L>
<L>The Princess he reveres, abhors the Sin:</L>
<L>'Tis a hard Task Superiors to reprove,</L>
<L>And mighty Vertue to resist such Love;</L>
<L>Amaz'd, he spoke in th' mildest Phrase he cou'd,</L>
<L>Instructs the Charming Princess to be good.</L>
<L>Then cry'd, What Frenzy's this that dares con∣troul</L>
<L>The Noble Greatness of <HI>Cleora</HI>'s Soul?</L>
<L>You're born Supream, your Lots are pair'd above:</L>
<L>Bounded by Fate from an inferiour Love.</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="19"/>
The <HI>Dauphin,</HI> first of Men, already's yours,</L>
<L>By Right Divine his lawful Claim secures:</L>
<L>I own ye beautious as the blooming <HI>May,</HI></L>
<L>Fair as the First, e'er Nature knew decay;</L>
<L>Still in your Looks you wear all conquering Charms,</L>
<L>But these are destin'd for my Masters Arms;</L>
<L>I'd give my Body to consuming Flame,</L>
<L>Leave any other Blot upon my Name,</L>
<L>E'er wrong, in you, that Royal Masters Fame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She rose with Fury, and would hear no more;</L>
<L>Disdain now work'd her boyling Spirits o'er,</L>
<L>Those Eyes shot Fire, that languish'd Love before.</L>
<L>She starts, then paus'd, and with a scornful Smile,</L>
<L>Foretold the Mischiefs and intended Guile.</L>
<L>The Count who knew no Ill, suspected none;</L>
<L>Blush'd for her Shame, and wish'd himself alone.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="14" REF="20"/>
<L>When straight she threw her Mantle on the Ground,</L>
<L>Her Garland tore, her curling Hair unbound;</L>
<L>Then seizing <HI>Angiers,</HI> with a Scream of Woe,</L>
<L>Cry'd Murder, Villain, Traytor, let me go.</L>
<L>The Voice of Terrour thro' the Pallace flies,</L>
<L>Follow'd still with loud incessant Cries;</L>
<L>Help all, oh help, or lost <HI>Cleora</HI> dies.</L>
<L>All hast, and swift as Thought th' Apartment's fill'd,</L>
<L>Where on the Flore the Princess they beheld;</L>
<L>The injur'd Earl confus'd and pale they View,</L>
<L>This Turn rob'd him of Speech and Reason too.</L>
<L>When false <HI>Cleora</HI> rear'd her weeping Face,</L>
<L>And Beauty gave to Sorrow double Grace,</L>
<L>Look on the base perfidious Man she said,</L>
<L>By whom the <HI>Dauphin</HI> and you're all betray'd;</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="21"/>
Trusting his Faith, I charg'd him to declare</L>
<L>Th' Affairs of State, and Business of the War,</L>
<L>The Conference strict Secrecy requir'd,</L>
<L>My waiting Servants by Command retir'd;</L>
<L>But e'er he half the <HI>Dauphins</HI> Will declar'd,</L>
<L>Seiz'd on my Hand, around like Madness star'd,</L>
<L>And cry'd, the Regent Princess now is mine,</L>
<L>She shall her Honour or her Life resign:</L>
<L>For I am wild with Loves ungovern'd Rage,</L>
<L>Possession only can my Flame asswage.</L>
<L>With the Surprize I scarce cou'd raise my Breath</L>
<L>To call your Aid which has secur'd from Death.</L>
<L>Who cou'd suppose the Raising of the Dead</L>
<L>Might see th' Amazement that each Face o'erspread;</L>
<L>None but the Wicked this sad Tale does please,</L>
<L>Nor dare his Enemies his Person seize.</L>
<L>Alone, disgrac'd he to his Palace goes,</L>
<L>And there reflects on his malicious Foes,</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="22"/>
Thinks on the Weight of his pretended Crimes,</L>
<L>Resolves to fly his coming Fate betimes:</L>
<L>For if he shou'd declare h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> Innocence,</L>
<L>And on the Princess cast the Black Offence,</L>
<L>The Laurels which the Prince abroad did gain,</L>
<L>Wou'd wither all at the unhappy Stain;</L>
<L>Resolv'd alone the rigorous Fate to bear,</L>
<L>And own the Guilt rather than lay't on her.</L>
<L>His speedy Flight is straight condemn'd by Fame,</L>
<L>And all ill Tongues are busie with his Name;</L>
<L>He takes two tender Pledges Wedlock gave,</L>
<L>The only Treasure he had Power to save:</L>
<L>With him <HI>Ernesto</HI> flies, faithful and just,</L>
<L>Who long had serv'd, and ne'er betray'd his Trust:</L>
<L>Thus the Great Man, whom that same rising Morn</L>
<L>Saw dress'd in Honours that such Trust adorn,</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="23"/>
With crowded Levee, and a waiting Train,</L>
<L>All the gay Pomps that can Observance Gain;</L>
<L>Now stript, forsaken, bare, disgrac'd and lost,</L>
<L>Wanders to find some hospitable Coast;</L>
<L>And as he travel'd towards the distant Sea,</L>
<L>A dreadful Light directs his doubtful Way;</L>
<L>He views his Castle blazing in one Flame;</L>
<L>The fierce Revenge of that invet'rate Dame;</L>
<L>Unmov'd, he saw the Structure tumble down;</L>
<L>And cry'd, thou can'st not bury my Renown:</L>
<L>In time perhaps my Truth may come to Light,</L>
<L>My Fame out-shine those Tow'rs that Blaze so bright,</L>
<L>And the mistaken World, tho' late, may see</L>
<L>A conspicuous Virtue in unhappy Me.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now in a Cell they snatch a short Repose;</L>
<L>Soon as the Sun the wakeful <HI>Angiers</HI> rose,</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="24"/>
His Courage yet unshock'd by adverse Fate,</L>
<L>His Noble Suff'ring show'd him truly Great.</L>
<L>But oh! when he beheld his little Pair,</L>
<L>The Mothers Darlings, and the Fathers Care,</L>
<L>In vain upon their Nurse and Servants call,</L>
<L>The Floods so long restrain'd, in Torrents fall;</L>
<L>At their sad Wants he cou'd no more forbear,</L>
<L>Indulg'd his Grief with many a pitying Fear;</L>
<L>The tender Charge, who thus awak'd his Care,</L>
<L>A little Son, and lovely Daughter were,</L>
<L>Both Beautious seem'd, as form'd by Hands Divine,</L>
<L>The Parents Graces in the Infants shine;</L>
<L><HI>Lewis</HI> the Son, a charming sprightly Boy,</L>

The helpless Infants, the wrong'd <HI>Angiers</HI> view'd,</L>
<L>Their woes, the dear <HI>Maria</HI>'s lost renew'd.</L>
<L>Dash'd by Dispair, and grov'ling on the Earth,</L>
<L>Curs'd the Malignant Star that rul'd his Birth,</L>
<L>Like some sad Wretch, long strugling for the Shore,</L>
<L>He sinks and gives his hopeless Labour o'er,</L>
<L>'Till old <HI>Ernesto</HI> urg'd him to remove,</L>

<L>Revenge will touch you in the tend'rest Part,</L>
<L>Her Rage will wound, thro' theirs, your Manly Heart:</L>
<L>He found 'twas vain to make a useless Moan,</L>
<L>The Father and the unhappy Babes must on.</L>

<L>Tho' injur'd much, he sighs to leave the <HI>Strand;</HI></L>
<L>And softly murmurs o'er his riged Fate,</L>
<L>Undone by Love, far worse than Mortal Hate;</L>
<L>Yet still he bids the list'ning Winds forbear,</L>
<L>Nor waft the Story to the <HI>Dauphin</HI>'s Ear;</L>
<L>For his sweet Peace he barters all his own,</L>

Poor <HI>Angiers</HI> still pursu'd by his ill Fate,</L>
<L>As if the Winds joyn'd with <HI>Cleora</HI>'s Hate;</L>

<L>Like his tempestuous Mind, no Calm, no Ease;</L>
<L>These Toils to old <HI>Ernesto</HI> were unknown,</L>
<L>A gentle Servitude his Years did crown;</L>
<L>Unable now, in his declining Age,</L>
<L>To act a longer Part on this rough Stage,</L>
<L>Pale Death, the last Retreat, and sure Relief,</L>
<L>Came to his Aid, and ends his Life and Grief:</L>
<L>The gashly Tyrant he seems joy'd to meet,</L>
<L>And sinks beneath his troubled Masters Feet:</L>
<L>There was no need of this; griev'd <HI>Angiers</HI> said,</L>
<L>Will Heaven still preserve the Wrath it made?</L>
<L>Why was this added to my Misery,</L>

<L>Gashly the King of Terrours does appear;</L>
<L>Black Guilt adds Horrour to tormenting Fear:</L>
<L>She looks around, and sees no Comfort nigh,</L>
<L>Spight of Imperial Greatness, she must dye;</L>
<L>To bear the Shock, she Summons former Pride,</L>
<L>She's grown too weak, all Aid is now deny'd:</L>
<L>Then let us yield; she sigh'd, and faintly said,</L>
<L>And sunk upon the Bosome of a faithful Maid;</L>
<L>Fetch here the Council, and the injur'd King,</L>
<L>Than Death, my Friends, I have a sharper Sting;</L>
<L><PB N="111" REF="129"/>
I cannot dye in Peace, while 'tis conceal'd,</L>
<L>And I must dye, for Shame, when 'tis reveal'd.</L>
<L>The waiting Slaves straight her Commands obey,</L>
<L>Eager the King, to hear what she wou'd say:</L>
<L>With weeping Eyes, he view'd departing Life,</L>
<L>And call'd her by the tender Names of Love and Wife.</L>
<L>Oh Prince! She cry'd, behold <HI>Cleora</HI> lost!</L>
<L>And sinking down, a guilty, guilty Ghost;</L>
<L>Unless great <HI>Angier</HI>'s Race you can restore,</L>
<L>I'm wrack'd on Earth with Pangs, and plung∣ing into more.</L>
<L>Forgive your Wife, let Mountains hide her Shame,</L>
<L>Mine was the Sin, mine th' impetuous Flame,</L>
<L>And curs'd <HI>Cleora</HI> only was to blame.</L>
<L>In this Cabinet you'll find the Story writ,</L>
<L>If 'tis possible, my fatal Crimes forget.</L>
<L><PB N="122" REF="130"/>
<HI>Angiers</HI> to Honour straight, and Grace retrieve,</L>
<L>And Natures Faults, let Heav'en and you forgive:</L>
<L>This said,</L>
<L>Nature asham'd, her Soul to earth inclin'd,</L>
<L>Broke the weak Tyes of her Majestick Mind,</L>
<L>That it might mount to purer Regions uncon∣fin'd.</L>
<L>Reason and Sense, from th' affrighted King is fled,</L>
<L>To hear th' unsuspected Guilt, and see her Dead;</L>
<L>Reviv'd, the Search of Truth his Soul pursues,</L>
<L>And with Amazement, he the Paper views,</L>
<L>Where every secret Thought, he saw confest,</L>
<L>And every guilty Wish that fill'd her Breast;</L>
<L>He groan'd to think how much he'd been de∣ceiv'd,</L>
<L>And said, no beauteous Woman e'er shou'd be believ'd.</L>
</LG>

<PB N="123" REF="131"/>
<L>Now to her Tomb's convey'd the unhappy Fair;</L>
<L>But busie Fame will not be buried there:</L>
<L>Fame seems to joyn with our invet'rate Foes,</L>
<L>Spreads our bad Deeds, and gathers as it goes;</L>
<L>And with the Rumour, Royal <HI>Mandate</HI>'s come,</L>
<L>To call the injur'd suff'ring <HI>Angiers</HI> home:</L>
<L>Rewards, whoever brings the Absent Lord,</L>
<L>And all his Castles, and his Lands restor'd.</L>
<L><HI>Angiers</HI> cou'd scarce resolve to trust again</L>
<L>Th' uncertain World, and faithless cruel Men,</L>
<L>Hid in a lowly State, a mean Retreat,</L>
<L>He found some Plagues, but none like being Great.</L>
<L>Now with a gentle Lord, his Age does rest,</L>
<L>No Care, nor Envy, does his Hours molest,</L>
<L>And Innocence and Peace possess his Breast.</L>
<L>His Children want the Greatness of his Name,</L>
<L>Nay he grows fond of the exalted Fame:</L>
<L><PB N="124" REF="132"/>
And as his Sons revolving in a Tent,</L>
<L>Discant on Change, Death, and this strange Event,</L>
<L>Both commiserate the guiltless Heroe's Fate;</L>
<L>Noblest Natures still, are most compassionate.</L>
<L>Attending <HI>Angiers</HI> heard, and strait came forth,</L>
<L>And with a Look, that stamp'd his Words for Truth,</L>
<L>Began:</L>
<L>My Lords, in Pity, lend an Ear,</L>
<L>They're bless'd, who'll not disdain the Poor to hear:</L>
<L>If you'll Admission to the King obtain,</L>
<L>(For my Endeavours, wou'd, alas, prove vain)</L>
<L>Of that unhappy <HI>Angiers,</HI> I might tell,</L>
<L>I've met him oft; indeed, I know him well:</L>
<L>They said the Favour's lessen'd, when with pain 'tis sought,</L>
<L>My Friend, thou sure shalt to the King be brought;</L>
<L><PB N="125" REF="133"/>
To th' Royal Tent, they strait their Steps direct,</L>
<L>And having paid the King their due Respect,</L>
<L>Thus <HI>Mand'vill</HI> spoke:</L>
<L>This aged Man of my Domestick Train,</L>
<L>Who begg'd with me, to cross the <HI>Brittish</HI> Main;</L>
<L>To your Majesty, he sais, he can relate</L>
<L>The History of your loft <HI>Angiers</HI> Fate:</L>
<L>Let him speak (hastily the King began)</L>
<L>For much I long to hear of that great injur'd Man.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As Noble <HI>Angiers</HI> spoke, and form'd his Tale,</L>
<L>In such pathetick Words, as must prevail;</L>
<L>The King observ'd, with an intensive View,</L>
<L>Then starting from his Seat, cry'd <HI>Angiers,</HI> it is you;</L>
<L>Those graceful Looks, and that dear faithful Voice,</L>
<L>In which my Youth, with Pleasure, did rejoyce:</L>
<L>Quick to my Arms, my constant Wish restore,</L>
<L>And Fate shall never, never part us more.</L>
<L><PB N="126" REF="134"/>
Who can express the Joy in every Face,</L>
<L>When they beheld him kneel, and saw the King embrace!</L>
<L>The Courtier's Flock, he's circled in the Crowd,</L>
<L>Of those who strive to speak their Welcome loud;</L>
<L>Soon to his wond'ring Son, the Story's told,</L>
<L>How in the <HI>East</HI> their Father they behold:</L>
<L>In Silence they their inward Joys suppress,</L>
<L>Blush they no sooner knew their Happiness.</L>
<L><HI>Mand'vill</HI> sunk with Shame, when Reflection brought</L>
<L>His Father's sharp Reproach to his revolving Thought.</L>
<L><HI>Angier</HI>'s Soul was to that Calmness grown,</L>
<L>That he forgave the Ills design'd, and those un∣known:</L>
<L>With Tears, the worthy kneeling Heroe rais'd,</L>
<L>And to the King their Deeds and Virtue prais'd.</L>
<L><PB N="127" REF="135"/>
To make the Earls returning Joy compleat,</L>
<L>A Victory they gain, with Wealth and Honour great;</L>
<L>They lead in Triumph, the long suff'ring Lord,</L>
<L>And he's to thrice his former Wealth restor'd.</L>
<L>The News to <HI>Violante,</HI> Fame conveys,</L>
<L>And soon as that, she's begg'd to cross the Seas:</L>
<L>The Kings own Yatch attends on her Command,</L>
<L>With all the Greatness of the <HI>Gallick</HI> Land.</L>
<L><HI>Florella</HI> here, sees Fortune's smoothest Brow,</L>
<L>Great in her Birth, as in her Marriage now;</L>
<L>Of all her Ills, wrong'd <HI>Angiers</HI> might bemoan,</L>
<L>He the chief Notice took, of this alone,</L>
<L>That she was branded mean, because unknown.</L>
<L>To the Earl Marshal, this said, he declare,</L>
<L>Let him not still dispise his charming Heir:</L>
<L>Tell him the Blood the Female Side supplies,</L>
<L>Does from as old and great a Fountain rise:</L>
<L><PB N="128" REF="136"/>
The haughty Marshal, does from her receive,</L>
<L>The wond'rous News, which they with Joy be∣lieve,</L>
<L>They all congratulate, then she takes her leave.</L>
<L>The Bark is driven by auspicious Gales,</L>
<L>And prosperous Winds fill all the swelling Sails;</L>
<L>Safely she's landed in her Father's Arms,</L>
<L>Adds to the Court, with her Superiour Charms.</L>
<L>Now Feasts and Joy, throughout the Realm a∣bound,</L>
<L>Revels and Masks make up the circling Round:</L>
<L>Thus they forget the Tempests they have past,</L>
<L>And thus Heroick Virtue's crown'd at last.</L>
