<P>SONGS IN THE COMIC OPERA OF Tom Thumb the Great.</P>

<HEAD>ADDRESS to the AUDIENCE by PUNCH, on the OPENING of the MICROCOSM.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>HUZZA! my hearts! our MICROCOSMIC Puppet-Show</L>
<L>Must stand; since fost'ring friends concur to prop it so.—</L>
<L>Let me be hang'd but I'm in perfect extacy,</L>
<L>Such a bright blooming bank of the fair sex to see;</L>
<L>So interspers'd with beaux, in gay variety,</L>
<L>That it fulfils my wish, ev'n to satiety.—</L>
<L>For, we, (tho' wooden mimies of humanity)</L>
<L>Are not such blocks as not to feel th' urbanity</L>
<L>Of your obliging readiness to come to us</L>
<L>In our new edifice, —well, an't it sumptuous?—</L>
<L>Are not all quondam much-complain'd of grievances</L>
<L>Amply redress'd by our well-plann'd contrivances?</L>
<L>Have not our brains been rack'd, and our poor purses drain'd,</L>
<L>To shew that no convenience was by us restrain'd?</L>
<L>Have we not built a cover'd way to shelter you;</L>
<L>Where no blasts russie, rains wet, or funs swelter you;</L>
<L>A green room,—lucky thought! where lolling, at her case,</L>
<L>STELLA may listen to her STREPHON'S flatteries</L>
<L>And point against his heart all her masqu'd batteries;</L>
<L>Here may of scandal-spreading prudes forget her awe,</L>
<L>Adjust her dress, balls, parties, drums—<HI>&amp; catera.</HI>—</L>
<L>Your entrance to our room last year, was odious:</L>
<L>But our new CORRIDOR is quite commodious.</L>
<L><PB N="iv" REF="3"/>Our MICROCOSM shines with a splendid dignity</L>
<L>Which may defy the cavils of malignity,</L>
<L>And flatter us with hopes of your benignity.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then on the inside, many faults are mended too,</L>
<L>Things, in no puppet show 'till ours, attended to.—</L>
<L>Observe, in true; perspective, stage and gallery,</L>
<L>Not like our former dog-hole, squeez'd and all awry:</L>
<L>Observe our light arrang'd in order curious,</L>
<L>Nor to the audience or the scene injurious.</L>
<L>Observe our high-rais'd benches curv'd with symmetry,</L>
<L>If any thinks he can outdo us, he may try.—</L>
<L>Ingress and egress, now, are free and elegant,</L>
<L>What more is wanting?— by my conscience! tell I can't, —</L>
<L>Save WELCOME:— which I snatch this opportunity</L>
<L>Of giving in the name of our community.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thrice welcome <HI>all!</HI>—our lib'ral hospitality</L>
<L>Is not consin'd to rank alone, or quality,</L>
<L>To charms or wealth:—(yet if we made a difference)</L>
<L>Such surely are entitled to some preference.</L>
<L>Our doors are shut to none; except such trumpery</L>
<L>As never ought be seen in decent company;</L>
<L>With that riff-raff we evermore must be at war,</L>
<L>And drive with ignominy from our Theatre.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Plain folks may enter and by seated happily;</L>
<L>Unle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s they shame themselves by dressing shabbily.</L>
<L>DECORUM is our guide rever'd, our governor,</L>
<L>Whose well-digested laws admit no sloven here.</L>
<L>For if a peer come like a porter jacketed,</L>
<L>Retire he must:—tho' up he raise his back at it,</L>
<L>And sorm, and sume, and bounce, and flounce, and racket it.</L>
<L>All this may shew what studious care we have of you;</L>
<L><PB N="v" REF="4"/>Now, in return, one favour let us crave of you;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The ladies' <HI>caps</HI> are risen to such enormity,</L>
<L>That, far from being a grace, they're a deformity:</L>
<L>(For gauge a modern female's height;—I'll venture on't</L>
<L>Ten guineas that her <HI>face</HI> is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound the centre on't.)</L>
<L>In such a room as ours they're quite preposterous;</L>
<L>A senseless nuisance.—But, I'll not be boisterous.</L>
<L>No. <HI>(kneels)</HI> PUNCH upon his knees in all humility,</L>
<L>Implores <HI>you,</HI> the true patterns of civility,</L>
<L>To lay them by when e'er you deign to visit us,</L>
<L>'Tis for the common good I'm thus sollicitous.</L>
<L>Do, lay them by; hide not each other from our view:</L>
<L>Else 'tis indifferent whether many come or few.</L>
<L>The kind polite compliance well would suit you all</L>
<L>And each would feel the condescension mutual.</L>
<L><HI>(Turns aside still kneeling and clasping his hands.)</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O Nature! hear my pray'r;—submiss I ask your aid</L>
<L>To free your master-pieces from this masquerade;</L>
<L>You form'd them perfect; artless you intended them;</L>
<L>But French-frizeurs have, for the worse, since mended them.</L>
<L>Why will they punish <HI>us</HI> who ne'er offended them?</L>
<L><HI>(He rises and comes forward.)</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nought can be call'd a SHOW, where nought is to be seen,</L>
<L>Where ev'ry bodies' light some huge head-robe is in.</L>
<L>The eye shou'd have free scope to rove ad libitum.—</L>
<L>Our scenes are fine; but we in vain contribute 'em,</L>
<L>If, only to gauze-caps, we can exhibit 'em.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Suppose, the men a fancy took to wear their hats</L>
<L>With the broad leaves slouch'd down; enough to scare the rats.</L>
<L>Wou'd you not think it rude? and call them Savages</L>
<L>Who, on your comforts, made such horrid ravages?</L>
<L><PB N="vi" REF="5"/>But they'll not dare to do it—in <HI>this</HI> place I mean,</L>
<L>They know there's a point I could disgrace 'em in</L>
<L>And of my vengeance give the clowns a specimen.—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now to conclude: if you bring dispositions</L>
<L>Vacant to harmless mirth, our exhibitions,</L>
<L>(Devoid of ribaldry and malice sinister</L>
<L>Some food, perhaps, to such light mirth may minister:</L>
<L>We our best efforts will exert, to coax you here:</L>
<L>And you will candid smile when our arch jokes you hear.</L>
<L>You have too much good sense and are too affable</L>
<L>Not to laugh out at what is truly laughable.</L>
<L>You know,—that all our pleasantries here local are,</L>
<L>That our performances are pastimes jocular,</L>
<L>To please the auricular organ and the ocular.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But whoso comes resolved on peevish criticism,</L>
<L>Watching to pick an hole for some flat witticism,</L>
<L>Smartly with trite <HI>Joe Miller</HI>'s <HI>Jests</HI> to tickle us,</L>
<L>We caution him to curb his gibe ridiculous.</L>
<L>Our stage shall be no butt, to vent his jest upon:</L>
<L>We're thorns, we're thistles; we shall sting if prest upon.</L>
<L>And tho' we scorn the sneers of such wit-coalheavers,</L>
<L>Yet we have <HI>Rowlands</HI> ready for their <HI>Olivers.</HI>—</L>
<L>On their defeat we will erect a grand trophy,</L>
<L>Prizing one gen'rous plaudit from philanthrophy</L>
<L>More, than we dread the hiss of all misanthrophy.</L>

<STAGE>The Curtain rising, discovers <HI>Merlin</HI> sitting at a table, covered with black; a large volume inscribed with magical figures open before him, after a while, he shuts the book and speaks.</STAGE>

<L>To night, the force of MAGIC skill to prove,</L>
<L>I mean t'exhibit PUPPETS that can move</L>
<L>Spontaneously;—nay more; can speak, can sing,</L>
<L>Fight,—laugh,—make love,—in short, do any thing;</L>
<L>Endu'd with transient life, for some three hours,</L>
<L>And, in contracted size with human pow'rs</L>
<L>They, for that while, with action, speech and dress,</L>
<L>Shall welcome all my friends to this recess;</L>
<L>Shall cringe, shall shrug, and sprawl along the stage,</L>
<L>Aping their brother blockheads of the age.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fear not, how'er, these tiny apparations:</L>
<L>I warrant 'em of harmless dispositions.—</L>
<L>They sha'n't approach you nearer than I stand:—</L>
<L>(I keep 'em under excellent command;)</L>
