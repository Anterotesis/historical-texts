<HEAD>A SATIRICAL DIALOGUE BETWEEN A <HI>Sea Captain</HI> and his <HI>Friend</HI> in Town.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<L>WELL met noble Captain, you're wellcome on Shore,</L>
<L>Pray when did you land?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>(Capt.)</SPEAKER>
<L>last Night,</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>(Gent.)</SPEAKER>
<L>Not before?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<L>No by <HI>G—d;</HI> 'twas a wonder I landed so soon,</L>
<L>For the Wind has blown hard since the change of the Moon.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<L>Pray what News do you bring from the <HI>African</HI> Coast?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why good News I think—I had surely been lost,</L>
<L>If NEPTUNE the <HI>Sovereign God of the Sea▪</HI></L>
<L>Had <HI>not</HI> interpos'd twixt EOLUS and ME.</L>
<L>But what's the most talk'd of in this famous City,</L>
<L>Where the PEOPLE are all <HI>so polite</HI> and <HI>so witty?</HI></L>
<L>So extensive the Place, it must <HI>something</HI> afford:</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why faith honest Captain, I know not a Word</L>
<L>That's worth my relating; yet list and you'l hear;</L>
<L>Tho' 'twill rather <HI>chagrine</HI> you, than <HI>please</HI> you I fear:</L>
<L>Our GENTRY of late, <HI>to their Honour be't spoke,</HI></L>
<L>(Who think themselves wiser than all other Folk)</L>
<L>Have <HI>acted,</HI> like People <HI>bereft of their Senses,</HI></L>
<L>For <HI>Gentility's lost</HI> when the <HI>Player commences.</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<L>The <HI>Player commences!</HI> Why what do you mean?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<L>Have Patience good Captain, I'll open the Scene:</L>
<L>You must know that in <HI>London</HI> some <HI>People</HI> there are,</L>
<L><HI>So fond of the Greatness, that waits on a Play'r,</HI></L>
<L>That at once <HI>they turn'd</HI> ACTORS <HI>themselves to expose;</HI></L>
<L>To the <HI>Pity of Friends</HI> and the <HI>Censure of Foes:</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<L>Lord <HI>what</HI> cou'd induce them such <HI>Madmen</HI> to be;</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<L>Oh you know the French Phrase, <HI>a la Mode de Paris,</HI></L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5"/>
Sir, the <HI>French</HI> have perform'd<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Alluding to an account in the Paper of a Play perform'd by Some young Noble∣men in France.</NOTE></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>(<HI>Capt.</HI>)</SPEAKER>
<L>oh then 'tis all well</L>
<L><HI>The</HI> English must follow them THO' 'TWERE TO HELL;</L>
<L>Where if <HI>Cerberus</HI> did not the <HI>French Men</HI> affright,</L>
<L>(But would let them go visit the <HI>Regions</HI> of <HI>Night</HI>)</L>
<L>Each <HI>Monkey,</HI> would after them, like a <HI>Brave Fellow,</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<L>As <HI>they've</HI> done now by <HI>playing the Fool</HI> —and OTHELLO.</L>
<L>There's a <HI>Fable</HI> I learn'd it at School Years ago,</L>
<L>I'll relate it, I think it is <HI>quite apropo:</HI></L>
<L>On a Time, as (Fame says) the <HI>Apes acted a Play:</HI></L>
<L>Tho I know not the Date of the Year or the Day,</L>
<L>Nor is it material since it was enacted.</L>
<L>And For <HI>Apes,</HI> 'twas done better than could be Expected?</L>
<L>The <HI>Asses</HI> Soon heard on't and <HI>they</HI> must Needs try.</L>
<L>Yet they used this Precaution that <HI>None should be by,</HI></L>
<L>But Those Who Were <HI>really Asses</HI> indeed:</L>
<L>For (says they) they may Laugh? if we do not Succeed;</L>
<L>But our <HI>Gentry</HI> So <HI>Confident bold,</HI> and <HI>Conceited,</HI></L>
<L>Ne'ver used this Precaution, But Fairly admitted.</L>
<L>An <HI>Audience of Critics,</HI> To See their Fine <HI>Play,</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<L><HI>Then the Asses In Fact Acted wiser than They.</HI></L>
<L>Pray How Was't Receiv'd were the <HI>Hearers</HI> quite <HI>Civil?</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<L><HI>Ay,</HI> or else the <HI>Whole Play</HI> had Gone <HI>Souse to the Devil.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Good Manners</HI> Obliged, them <HI>Somtimes</HI> to applaud;</L>
<L>Tho they Little Deserv'd it:</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>(<HI>Capt.</HI>)</SPEAKER>
<L>I Believe so by G-d.</L>
<L>And Pray <HI>What expence</HI> Might attend <HI>this Affair,</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why <HI>FIFTEEN HUNDRED POUNDS</HI> our papers declare.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<L><HI>Fifteen Hundred!</HI> D'ye Say, Why G-d Dam my Blood</L>
<L>So much Money Spent to do no Sort of Good,</L>
<L>How much more Commendable would it have been?</L>
<L>Since Objects of Pity So frequent are seen.</L>
<L>With benevolent Hands to have giv'n it to Those,</L>
<L>And not paid so dearly themselves to expose;</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<L>Faith Captain you're right, <HI>my</HI> Opinion's the same,</L>
<L>For in <HI>every Respect</HI> they are <HI>greatly to blame:</HI></L>
<L>Now <HI>if</HI> I was an Actor, <HI>this Method</HI> I'd take,</L>
<L>The <HI>Stage</HI> and its <HI>Drudgery</HI> both I'd <HI>forsake;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Turn</HI> GENTLEMAN <HI>now,</HI> as the GENTRY <HI>turn Players</HI></L>
<L>And <HI>exhibit a Taste</HI> far <HI>genteeler than</HI> THEIRS.</L>

<L>WHY what a Trick they've play'd me here egad,</L>
<L>Pray is'nt it enough to make one <HI>Mad:</HI></L>
<L>Such idle Things these Men—<HI>Dull dronish Rogues,</HI></L>
<L>To make us <HI>tender Souls</HI> speak Epilogues:</L>
<L>But yet I partly guess what they're about;</L>
<L>And faith I'll tell, <HI>for Wit and Truth will out.</HI></L>
<L><HI>You</HI> too may guess—but this I know the Case is,</L>
<L>The Chaps are all <HI>asham'd to shew their Faces;</HI></L>
<L>But shame's th' <HI>Effect of Guilt</HI>—it is most certain</L>
<L>No wonder then they've <HI>sneak'd behind the Curtain.</HI></L>
<L>And send me here to gild a dirty Cause,</L>
<L>To tickle your good-natures for Applause,</L>
<L>If I don't mawl 'em for't, Let them mawl me</L>
<L>I'll teach the scurvy Knaves Civillity.</L>

<L>Well but good Audience did you like the Play,</L>

<L>For sure <HI>such Wretches</HI> never trod the Stage,</L>
<L>Unless it were to <HI>lull</HI> a <HI>nodding Age;</HI></L>
<L>Well for my Part, it pleas'd me to the Life,</L>
<L>To hear Oth—llo bawl so for his Wife.</L>
<L><HI>Wife! what Wife!</HI>—he <HI>had</HI> a <HI>Wife</HI> last Summer,</L>
<L>And has so still—<HI>He's only parted from her.</HI></L>
<L>But that's a c—tly Fault—no more of That,</L>
<L>They both consented, so 'twas <HI>Tit</HI> for <HI>Tat,</HI></L>
<L>Suppose he <HI>had</HI> lost her—<HI>why</HI> this mighty Pother,</L>
<L>His <HI>Monkey F—t</HI> can help him to <HI>another.</HI></L>
</LG>

<L>But soft methinks I hear him rave behind,</L>
<L>Bear witness all—<HI>he swears he'll beat me blind:</HI></L>
<L>Why let the great and mighty Hero come,</L>
<L>And beat his Fill—he cannot beat me Dumb;</L>
<L>I'll have my Way in spite of Friends or Foes,</L>
<L>I've said no more than what the Audience knows.</L>
