<P>THE Labours of Study of what∣soever kind they are, do natural∣ly chuse their proper Patrons. There will be always some excelling in every Sort of Knowledge, to whom the vari∣ous Parts of Learning will be more just∣ly adapted.</P>
<P>As then every Part of the COMMON-PRAYER speaks the Breathings of the greatest of Saints, the earliest Antiqui∣ty, and the soundest Faith; so a Trea∣tise on any Part of it will be most suit∣ably patronized by a Lover of our Church, and a Practiser of her Doctrines, by one skill'd in her Offices, and un∣shaken in her Faith. I hope, therefore you'll excuse the Freedom of a Dedica∣tion, since the Nature of this Perfor∣mance calls for your Protection of it.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="3"/>Or whether you are considered as sprung from a <HI>Great Ornament</HI> of our Church; From one learned in Antiqui∣ty, truly Orthodox, primitive in his Example, and holy in his Life: Or whether, as you are allied to that <HI>No∣ble Family,</HI> which gives Examples to the World of the earliest Virtue, and a lasting Piety, of Veneration for the Church, and Esteem for her Clergy, of such as rejoyce in doing <HI>Good Works</HI> to the one, and Deeds of <HI>Hospitality</HI> to the other; your Right to this Treatise is not a little strengthned.</P>
<P>But when, together with these I re∣flect on your placing me in your Friend∣ship and Familiarity, and the many kind and affectionate Offices you have done me, you'll easily pardon my Choice, as it affords me so just a Patron, and gives me an Opportunity of somewhat acknowledging your many Favours to,</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Design of the following Pages, is to shew the Relati∣on the <HI>COLLECTS, EPI∣STLES,</HI> and <HI>GOSPELS,</HI> from the first Sunday in <HI>Ad∣vent,</HI> till <HI>Trinity-Sunday,</HI> have to their Respective Times and Seasons; and what Connection and Agreement every <HI>COL∣LECT, EPISTLE,</HI> and <HI>GOSPEL</HI> for the Sundays after <HI>Trinity</HI> till <HI>Advent,</HI> have among themselves. And this, I hope, may be of some Service, not only as it is exceedingly delightful to the Mind, to consider the Order, and Fitness, and Har∣mony of these Offices, but as it will make them have that Esteem and Regard paid them, they justly deserve; as it will speak clearly the Wisdom of the Church in so compiling them; as it will instruct in a
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>due Knowledge of Times and Seasons; and make them be a more <HI>Reasonable Service,</HI> than they usually are with the most of People.</P>
<P>Bishop <HI>Sparrow,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Wheatley,</HI> in their excellent Treatises of the <HI>Common-Prayer,</HI> have both of them treated of this in the Sundays before <HI>Trinity.</HI> But then what they have wrote on this Subject, is lodged in a Book which is not easily got by those, who will reap the greatest Bene∣fit from a Work of this Nature. I have therefore considered, in as narrow a Com∣pass as I conveniently could, both the <HI>Of∣fices</HI> before and after <HI>Trinity,</HI> in the Manner above mentioned. And this I have done not only from such Hints and Passages of the Moderns, (particularly the two great Men above-mentioned) as give any but also from the ancient <HI>RI∣TUALISTS.</HI></P>
<P>I hope it will be no Fault, that it comes after so many much more valuable and learned Treatises on the <HI>Common-Prayer,</HI> as it aims at nothing more than the In∣struction of the Ignorant in this Part of it, which as far as I know has not hi∣therto been so published, as to be of Ser∣vice to them.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Of</HI> ADVENT.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Word <HI>Advent</HI> signifies <HI>Com∣ing,</HI> and is appropriated to the Time preceeding <HI>Christ∣mass</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Hug. a San. Vict. Lib. <HI>3.</HI> c. <HI>4.</HI></NOTE> to commemorate that Time, in which the Messiah was so much ex∣pected; and also to prepare us for his Coming in the Flesh; For this Season is to <HI>Christmass-Day,</HI> what <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Baptist</HI> was to our Lord, <HI>a Fore-runner, and Preparer of the Way.</HI></P>
<P>It is observable, that the Church in celebra∣ting the most remarkable Histories of our Sa∣viour's Life and Death, hath followed the Order they were done in, and plac'd them answerable to their respective Times. Thus she comme∣morates his Nativity before his Death, and his Death before his Resurrection and Ascension. And this is the Reason why the Office of our Lord's Advent, precedes the other Offices of the Church, <HI>viz.</HI> Because his Coming in the Flesh was prior to all the Transactions the other Offi∣ces were compil'd of. And as by the <HI>Advent</HI> of our Lord, there was a Renovation of Things, agreeable to that of St. <HI>John,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Rev.</HI> xxi. 19.</NOTE> <HI>Be∣hold I make all Things new,</HI> so the Church, in Honour of his <HI>Advent,</HI> begins her Year of Offices at the Time of Reno∣vation.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="7"/>THIS <HI>Advent</HI> lies in four Weeks, tho' as the Ritualists tell us, these four Weeks are ne∣ver held intire. <Q>The Church, <HI>say they,</HI> hath set these apart, to denote and point out the <HI>Fourfold Coming</HI> of Christ, and that the last is<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Christmass-Eve, they say, is no Part of <HI>Advent,</HI> and therefore the last Week is never com∣pleat.</NOTE> incompleat, because when he makes his last Appear∣ance, the Glory of his Saints shall have no End. The first Week, <HI>say they,</HI> of this Holy Season re∣presents to us, his Coming in the Flesh, of which it was said,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Mat.</HI> xxi.</NOTE> <HI>Ho∣sanna to the Son of</HI> David; <HI>Blessed is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord.</HI> The second denotes his Coming, and Descent into the Hearts of the Faithful, of which it is said,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">John <HI>xiv.</HI></NOTE> <HI>We will come unto him, and make our Abode with him:</HI> and of which, also, that in the <HI>Prophet</HI> relates to,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Habb. <HI>ii.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Tho' it tarry, wait for it, because it will surely come, it will not tarry.</HI> The third signifies his <HI>Third Advent,</HI> which is in the Hour of Death, to which that of St. <HI>James</HI> relates, <HI>Be ye also Patient, stablish your Hearts, for the Coming of the Lord draweth nigh.</HI> The fourth is an Emblem of his last Coming, when he shall come in Majesty to judge the World, of which it is said in the Propet<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Isai. <HI>iii.</HI></NOTE> <HI>The Lord will enter into Judgment with the Ancients, of his People.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THUS the Church delineates these four Comings of our Saviour, in her setting apart the four Weeks of these Seasons: Tho' it is observa∣ble in her Offices appointed for them, she only commemorates two of them, <HI>viz.</HI> his Coming in
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>the Flesh and his Coming to Judgment; for his Coming in the <HI>Flesh,</HI> and his Coming into the <HI>Hearts of good Men,</HI> are in Effect but one Com∣ing, as are also his Coming at <HI>the Hour of Death, and in the Day of Judgment.</HI></P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the <HI>COLLECTS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Collects are most of them of great Antiquity, as is evident from many Autho∣rities. They are so called, either<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Microl. c. <HI>3.</HI></NOTE> because the Priest that officiated collected into them the Devotions of the People, or, as being used upon the People's being collected, or gathered together, or, as others think, and with greater Probability, be∣cause of their being chiefly collected from the Epistles and Gospels. But however this be, they are the Breathings of the Holiest Times, and have been used by the best of Men, and must therefore be acknowledged of great Bene∣fit and Advantage.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>Of the</HI> EPISTLES <HI>and</HI> GOSPELS.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Epistles</HI> and <HI>Gospels</HI> are of equal Anti∣quity with the Collects, and are ranged in an admirable Order, following each other in a natural Series of Things, and expressing the Hi∣story of the Season they relate to. They are divided, as the Year is, into two Parts; the one beginning at <HI>Advent,</HI> and ending at <HI>Trinity Sun∣day;</HI> the other then beginning, and ending at <HI>Advent.</HI> The Former shews us the Example of our Lord, the Latter instructs us how to follow his Example.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<PB N="4" REF="9"/>
<HEAD>The first Sunday in <HI>Advent.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Collect for this Day, is taken out of the <HI>Epistle</HI> and <HI>Gospel,</HI> and has a two-fold View, the one to remind us of his Coming in the <HI>Flesh,</HI> the other of his Coming to <HI>Judgment.</HI> It therefore im∣plores the <HI>Grace</HI> of God, that now, in our Sa∣viour's first <HI>Advent,</HI> when he came to visit us, as <HI>the Prophet</HI> intimates in the <HI>Gospel, in great Humility,</HI> we <HI>may so cast off the Works of Dark∣ness,</HI> mentioned in the <HI>Epistle,</HI> that at his se∣cond Coming we may rise to the Life of Light and Glory.</P>
<P>The EPISTLE is an Exhortation to Love, which is in Effect the Fulfilling of the whole Law. And this it also excites us to, from the present Consideration of Things; <HI>That now it is high Time to awake out of Sleep. The Night is far spent, the Day is at Hand:</HI> Which tho' first of all wrote by the Apostle to the Christian Converts, to shake off their Sleep and Drow∣siness, and excite them to Vigilancy and Activity in the christian Life: And tho' the <HI>Night</HI> here will undoubtedly signifie the Time of Life, in which we grope about, and wander in
<PB N="5" REF="10"/>Darkness, in Comparison of that Day we shall afterwards behold<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="marg"><HI>Cor.</HI> i. 13.</NOTE> when the Vail shall be taken away, and <HI>we shall</HI> no longer <HI>see through a Glass darkly;</HI> yet it also must remind us of the Circumstances of the present Season, and bring into our Minds, that Night which hung upon the World before our Saviour's Coming, and how it was dispelled and driven a∣way, by the <HI>Day-spring from on high.</HI> When then these Words are read, <HI>the Night is far spent,</HI> &amp;c. Our Hearts should be filled with Joy and Comfort. For they should represent to us the World's long lying in Darkness, that now the Shadows are fleeing away, and that the Sun of Righteousness is approaching; That the Na∣tivity of the Messiah, the Saviour of the World is near.</P>
<P>The GOSPEL of our Saviour's Riding to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> has been the Peculiar of this first Sun∣day in Advent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Microl. de Eccles. Obs. c. <HI>31.</HI></NOTE> from ancient Times. It seems, indeed, rather proper for <HI>Palm-Sunday,</HI> which was the Day he made this Journey on to his Passi∣on, and is accordingly used by some Churches; But yet when we consider the Words, <HI>Blessed is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord, Hosan∣na in the highest, i. e.</HI> blessed be his Coming in the Flesh, for which is due the greatest Hosan∣nahs, we may see manisestly its Harmony to the Season, in the<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="marg">Bish. Spar. Rat. Dur. lib. <HI>6.</HI> c. <HI>3.</HI></NOTE> Opinion of both the Ancient and Moderns; and al∣so how agreeable it is to the Epistle, which tells us, <HI>Now is our Salvation near, the Day is at Hand,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<PB N="6" REF="11"/>
<HEAD>The second SUNDAY in <HI>Advent.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Collect is taken out of the Epistle, which mentions, that <HI>whatever Things were written aforetime, were written for our Learning, that we through Patience and Comfort of the Scrip∣tures, might have hope:</HI> And therefore it says, a little after, <HI>as it is written,</HI> and so mentions some Prophecies relating to our Saviour's first Coming into the World. The Collect there∣fore will appear very suitable for the Time, if it be consider'd as a Petition to God, that we may receive all<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Coll.</NOTE> <HI>his holy World,</HI> and at this Season that Part of it in par∣ticular, which Prophesies of our Lord's first Coming into the World, that <HI>me may be</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Fpist.</NOTE> <HI>comforted by it, and ever hold fast the blessed</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="marg">Epist.</NOTE> <HI>Hope of everlasting Life.</HI></P>
<P>The EPISTLE treats of our Lord's first Advent, and in a particular Manner how he came to save us of the <HI>Gentile</HI> World; and men∣tions some Prophecies relating to us, that we may be <HI>comforted</HI> by them, and<NOTE N="§" PLACE="marg">Epist.</NOTE> <HI>glorifie God for his Mercy:</HI> As first that in the 18th <HI>Psalm, For this Cause I will con∣fess to the among the</HI> Gentiles, <HI>and sing Praises unto thy Name:</HI> And that in <HI>Deuteronomy</HI> the xxxii, <HI>Rejoyce ye</HI> Gentiles <HI>with his People.</HI> And again <HI>Psalm</HI> the cxvii, <HI>Praise him all ye</HI> Gentiles, <HI>and laud him all ye People:</HI> And lastly <HI>Isaiah</HI> in his xi Chapter says, <HI>There shall be a Root of</HI> Jesse, <HI>and he that shall rise to reign over the</HI> Gen∣tiles, <HI>in him shall the</HI> Gentiles <HI>trust.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="12"/>The GOSPEL treats of our Lord's second Coming to judge the World, as the Epistle did of his first Coming into it: Which may teach us, That those Men, who will not receive the First Coming of their Saviour, will be compell'd to acknowledge Him at his Second. They who will not<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Epist.</NOTE> <HI>confess to him among the</HI> Gentiles, <HI>shall have</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Gosp.</NOTE> <HI>Hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those Things which are coming on the Earth</HI> at the Day of Judgment. But on the con∣trary,<NOTE N="§" PLACE="marg">Epist.</NOTE> <HI>they who are filled with all Joy and Peace in believing, and abound in Hope through the Power of the Holy Ghost; when</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Gosp.</NOTE> <HI>these Things begin to come to pass, they shall look up, and lift up their Heads, because their Redemption draweth nigh.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the Church in this Day's Office, prepares us for the first Coming of our Lord, by threat∣ening us with the Terrors of his Second; by assuring us, we must bear the Troubles of that <HI>Evil-Day,</HI> if we answer not the End and De∣sign of our Saviour's first Coming, by leading holy and religious Lives.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The third SUNDAY in <HI>Advent.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS Week being the last of the <HI>Four Sea∣sons</HI> or <HI>Ember Weeks,</HI> set apart by the Church, for the Dedicating of the Seasons to God, and imploring his Blessing upon the Or∣dinations then perform'd, the Church hath made the Collect suitable to this Occasion; Not that she forgets our Saviour's first Advent, but along with it, takes Notice of the Practice of this Sea∣son.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="13"/>THE Collect is taken out of the Epistle and Gospel, and is a Petition to our Lord, that<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Epist.</NOTE> <HI>the Ministers and Stewards of his Mysteries,</HI> may in like Manner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Gosp.</NOTE> <HI>pre∣pare his Way</HI> against his Coming to Judgment, as<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Gosp.</NOTE> <HI>his Messenger at his first Coming prepar'd it before him.</HI></P>
<P>The EPISTLE, treats of the Ministers of God's Word, and of our Saviour's second Ad∣vent; shewing the Dignity of their Office, and how wrong it is in the World to throw its Censures upon them, as is frequently done; that they should be left to the Judgement of the Lord who when he comes the second Time to<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Mat.</HI> xviii.</NOTE> <HI>take an Account of his Servants, will render to every One according to their Works.</HI></P>
<P>The GOSPEL treats of our Saviour's first Coming, and gives us the History of <HI>John</HI>'s Sen∣ding two of his Disciples to him, who were to learn from himself, <HI>Whether it was he that should come, or they were to look for another.</HI> This the Baptist did, not to satisfy any Doubt of his own, for he was perfectly convinc'd of the Truth of our Saviour's Mission; but that as he was short∣ly to leave the World, his Disciples, who were not as yet fully satisfied, might be convinc'd and become his Disciples.</P>
<P>THE Close of this Gospel, <HI>Behold I send my Messenger, &amp;c.</HI> seems to have been the chief Rea∣son of the Church's Using this Gospel at this Sea∣son: that it might teach us that the Way of the Lord was to be prepared by his Messenger, and that therefore we must expect this Messenger, before the Lord himself come.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="14"/>THE Character our Saviour gives of <HI>John,</HI> of his Constancy in the Faith, and his Austerity of Life, makes the Gospel also answerable to the <HI>Ember Season.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The fourth SUNDAY in <HI>Advent.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Collect prays for Christ's <HI>Coming and Succour</HI> in a most ardent Manner, that the <HI>Sins and Wickedness</HI> which stop us in our chri∣stian Race, may be removed through <HI>Grace and Mercy,</HI> the Consequents of our Saviour's Coming in the Flesh.</P>
<P>The EPISTLE does as it were point out the Coming of our Lord, not as at a Distance, but in hast and immediately: <HI>The Lord is at Hand.</HI> How seasonably therefore does it advise us, <HI>to Rejoyce in the Lord?</HI> As it were exhorting us to be chearful, because of the <HI>Messiah</HI>'s near and speedy Coming into the World.</P>
<P>As the GOSPEL of the last Sunday told us of the Messenger who should prepare the Way before our Lord's Coming; so the present Gospel shews us this Messenger, in the Exercise of his Errand, in an actual Preparation for Christ's Coming, and <HI>making straight the Way of the Lord,</HI> And these Words, <HI>There standeth One among you, whom ye know not, he it is who coming,</HI> &amp;c. are very agreeable to the Season: They do all but bring the Messiah. And as the Epistle tells us, <HI>That he is at Hand;</HI> so here the Gospel tells us, as it were, that his Manifestation is so near, that he is <HI>even just now among</HI> us, <HI>but we know him not yet:</HI> Which is answering exactly the
<PB N="10" REF="15"/>Nearness of this Sunday to Christmass-day, be∣fore which Time <HI>we knew him not.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>CHRISTMASS-DAY.</HEAD>
<P>HE whom we have been expecting in this Season of Advent, and whom the Offices of that Season spoke of, as Coming, has now really come, and appear'd in the World; and therefore the Offices speak no longer of a State of Expectancy, but of a State of Fruition: They speak not of him as coming, but really come.</P>
<P>THE Collect mentions him as born at this Time, and prays that we may be regenerated and made the Children of God by Adoption and Grace, and be daily renewed by the Holy Spirit, which are the Benefits of Christ's Birth.</P>
<P>The EPISTLE speaks of his being actually come into the World, and assures us, <HI>That in these last Days,</HI> God hath <HI>spoken unto us by his Son.</HI></P>
<P>The GOSPEL also answers the Season, as it speaks of our Saviour's being come into the World. <HI>He was in the World; and, He came unto his own.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Saint <HI>STEPHEN'S</HI> Day.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are several Reasons given for the Placing of this and the two following Fe∣stivals in the Order they now stand; immedi∣ately after Christ's Nativity, and before the Rest
<PB N="11" REF="16"/>of the Saints: The most probable of which seems to be this; as our Lord in his Gospel says, <HI>If a∣ny Man will come after me, let him take up his Cross and follow me,</HI> So it hath pleased the Wis∣dom of the Church, that those who took up their Cross, and followed him by Martyrdom, should be first in his Retinue. Now there are three Sorts of Martyrdom, one in <HI>Will</HI> and in <HI>Deed;</HI> another in <HI>Will,</HI> not in <HI>Deed;</HI> the other in <HI>Deed,</HI> not in <HI>Will.</HI> Saint <HI>Stephen</HI>'s Martyr∣dom being therefore the First, and Highest of those, it hath deservedly the first Place after our Saviour. Yesterday, says St. <HI>Austin,</HI> we cele∣brated the Birth Day of the <HI>King of Martyrs,</HI> born in the World, and to Day the <HI>first of Mar∣tyrs</HI> going out of the World. It was fit the Immortal should first take upon him Flesh for Mortals, that so the <HI>Mortal</HI> might despise Death, for the <HI>Immortal.</HI> The Lord was therefore born to die for his Servant, that the Servant might not fear to die for his Lord. Christ was born in Earth, that <HI>Stephen</HI> might be born in Heaven.</P>
<P>THE Collect acknowledging <HI>with the Mar∣tyr of the Day,</HI> the Divinity of our Lord, prays to him, in Imitation of the Martyr, that in <HI>all our Sufferings here for the Testimony of the Truth,</HI> we may with him, <HI>look up stedfastly, into Hea∣ven, and by Faith behold the Glory which shall be revealed; And being filled with the Holy Ghost,</HI> as he was, <HI>we may learn,</HI> from him, to pray for our Persecutors to our Lord, <HI>who standeth at the Right Hand of God,</HI> as he saw him, to Succour those who suffer for him.</P>
<P>The EPISTLE, is the Story of <HI>Stephen</HI>'s Martyrdom.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="17"/>The GOSPEL is very suitable to the Oc∣casion, as it mentions our Saviour's Prophecy of the Treatment that his Followers should have a∣mong the Jews; especially, as it speaks of their <HI>stoneing them which were sent unto them,</HI> and in in∣stancing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Chron.</HI> II. XXIV. 21.</NOTE> <HI>Zacharias,</HI> who was ston∣ed to Death; and as it also ma∣kes mention of <HI>Abel,</HI> who was the <HI>Protomartyr</HI> of the Old Testament, as St. <HI>Stephen</HI> was of the New.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Saint <HI>JOHN'S</HI> Day.</HEAD>
<P>THE Festival of St. <HI>John,</HI> stands next to that of St. <HI>Stephen,</HI> because his Martyrdom was next in Kind to that of St. <HI>Stephen</HI>'s: that is, he was a Martyr in <HI>Will,</HI> tho' not in <HI>Deed.</HI> For he was miraculously delivered from the Caldron of <HI>Boiling Oil,</HI> which he was thrown into, at <HI>Rome,</HI> coming out without any Maim or Hurt.</P>
<P>THE Collect from the Light mentioned in the Epistle, prays for the Illumination of the Church, that it may be enlightened by the mysterious Doctrines of the Apostle of this Day; and so walk in that <HI>Light,</HI> as at last to obtain that <HI>Light,</HI> which we are told in the Epistle, is <HI>God.</HI></P>
<P>The EPISTLE mentions <HI>the Doctrine of this holy Apostle and Evangelist,</HI> which the Col∣lect prays the Church may be enlightened by, <HI>viz.</HI> the Doctrine of our Lord's Divinity, which he so sublimely treats of in his Gospel, beginning it in the same Manner, he begins the present E∣pistle. It was the Handling of this lofty Doct∣rine,
<PB N="13" REF="18"/>that made him be compar'd to an Eagle, flying within the Clouds, beyond the narrow Sight of Men, and for which also he has the pe∣culiar Character of <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Divine.</HI></P>
<P>The GOSPEL is that famous Passage where our Saviour Answers the Curiosity of <HI>Peter,</HI> about the Death of <HI>John. If I will that he tarry 'till I come, what is that to thee? Follow thou me.</HI> Which though some of them interpreted, that <HI>John</HI> therefore should not die; yet we have both the Word of <HI>John</HI> himself, which teaches us, that <HI>Jesus said not unto him, he shall not die; but if I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?</HI> And also Ecclesiastical History, assuring us, that he did die; For he dy'd twenty-eight Years after our Lord came to destroy the City <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> which is the Coming spoken of in the Gospel.</P>

<P>NEXT to the Feast of St. <HI>John,</HI> stands the Day of the <HI>Holy Innocents:</HI> Their Martyr∣dom being that of the last Kind, a Martyrdom in <HI>Deed,</HI> not in <HI>Will.</HI> They shewed not forth the Praise of the Lord in speaking, but in dying for him; For, for his Sake, and in his Stead, were they slain. Thus, beautifully and wisely are these Festivals placed after the Birth of Christ. They answer, as it were the Church's Descrip∣tion of him in the <HI>Canticles,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Cant.</HI> v. 10.</NOTE> <HI>My beloved is White and Ruddy, and the Chiefest among ten thousand.</HI> For he is white in the Chastity and Purity of <HI>John,</HI> ruddy in the
<PB N="14" REF="19"/>Blood of <HI>Stephen,</HI> and the Chiefest among ten thousand, by the suffering Innocents.</P>
<P>THE Collect prays God, who out of the Mouths of Babes and Sucklings hast ordained Strength, and made the Infants of <HI>Bethlehem</HI> to give him Glory by their Deaths, <HI>to mortify in us all Vices;</HI> that we may have the Innocency of this Day's Martyrs, and be so strengthened with his Grace, that if call'd upon to suffer, we may be constant in the Faith, even to Death; and so may glorify his Holy Name.</P>
<P>The EPISTLE is no doubt a Discription of the whole Church in Christ, but yet there are several Things in it suitable to this Occasion, as it describes in particular the Martyrs of the Day; for it says, <HI>These are they which are not defiled with Women, for they are Virgins; These were re∣deemed from among Men, being the first Fruits un∣to God, and to the Lamb; And in their Mouth was found no Guile: For they were without Fault before the Throne of God.</HI></P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The SUNDAY after <HI>Christmass.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT was usual in the primitive Times, for some Part of the Offices of great Festivals, to be repeated every Day, 'till the Octave, or eighth Day after, which was the last Day of its being repeated, and the End of the Festival. The
<PB N="15" REF="20"/>Church therefore in Imitation of this ancient Cu∣stom, has the Collect of Christmass-Day, for this Day also, which generally falls within the Octave of Christmass. Bishop <HI>Sparrow</HI> tells us, the Ob∣servation of Octaves is done out of Honour to the Feast, and that greater Solemnities have some Days after them, to continue the Memory of them.</P>
<P>THE Reason of their being lengthen'd to eight Days, is taken from the <HI>Jews,</HI> who observ'd some of their higher Festivals, for the<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Amar. Gor. Lib. <HI>4.</HI> c. <HI>36,</HI></NOTE> same Number of Days, it be∣ing thought by the primitive Church, that those Jewish Feasts, which were only the Shadow, should by no Means exceed their Feasts, which were the Substance.</P>
<P>BUT according to others there<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Rupert, de Divin. Offic. Lib. <HI>8.</HI> c. <HI>5.</HI> b. Juon. Carnot. Serm. de Cir∣cum, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> is a mystical Meaning in the Obser∣vation of Octaves, and that is, that the Octave is an Emblem of the Mystical eight Day, which is the Day of the Resurrection. For as on that Day we shall return to our former Inno∣cence, so the Church, as an Emblem of it, re∣peats on the Octave, and the Days between the Festival and it, some of the first Days Office; thereby teaching us, that if we continue in the Worship of God, after being regenerated by Baptism, we shall on the Octave of the Resur∣rection, after the seven Days of our Life have passed away, return to our first Purity and Ho∣liness.</P>
<P>The EPITLE treats of our Saviour's Birth, and mentions the Advantages accruing to us from thence: That whereas before, the Church of
<PB N="16" REF="21"/>God, <HI>like an Heir under Age, differed nothing from a Servant,</HI> being burthened with Ceremo∣nies, and the Observations of the Law; it was now by the Coming of his Son, arriv'd at Ma∣turity, and freed from those Incumbrances, so that its Members <HI>are</HI> no more <HI>Servants;</HI> But Sons and Heirs of God, through Christ.</P>
<P>THE Church seems to have chosen this E∣PISTLE with a View to our Saviour's Infan∣cy: <HI>For the Heir under Age, differing nothing from a Servant, tho' he be Lord of all;</HI> is no ob∣scure or mean Remembrancer of our Saviour's Condition at this time<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Heb. <HI>i.</HI></NOTE> who was appointed Heir of all Things; and<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Phil.</HI> ii. 7.</NOTE> <HI>yet took upon him the Form of a Ser∣vant,</HI> tho' he<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="marg"><HI>Acts</HI> x. 36.</NOTE> <HI>was Lord of all.</HI></P>
<P>The GOSPEL also treats of our Saviour's Birth, and is an Explication of <HI>God's</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="marg">Epist.</NOTE> <HI>sending forth his Son, made of a Woman, when the fullness of Time was come;</HI> For it relates to the Human Nature of our Lord, as that of Christmass-Day does to the Divine.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The <HI>CIRCUMCISIONS</HI> of CHRIST.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Day, tho' the Octave of Christmass-day<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Isidor. c. <HI>40.</HI> de Eccl. Offic.</NOTE> was formerly observed a Fast by the Church, because of those Sports, and abominable Customs practis'd on it by the Heathen, in Honour of their God, <HI>Janus.</HI> Afterwards it was changed into the Feast of the Circumcision, it being the
<PB N="17" REF="22"/>Day from the Nativity of our Lord, and therefore the Day on which he was circumcised, according to the Command given to <HI>Abraham,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg"><HI>Gen.</HI> xvii. 12.</NOTE> <HI>He that is eight Days old shall be circumcised among you.</HI></P>
<P>THE Collect is a Petition to God, that <HI>as he made his own Son to be circumcised,</HI> so he would grant us the <HI>Circumcision of the Spirit,</HI> which is, <HI>the Cutting off from our Hearts and Members all worldly Lusts;</HI> That as our Lord by the Circum∣cision of the Flesh was obedient to the Law, so we by <HI>the Circumcision of the Spirit, may be obe∣dient to his Will.</HI></P>
<P>The EPISTLE also is very suitable to the Festival, as it shews who they are that are the Bles∣sed of God; whether those of the Circumcision or those of the Uncircumcision; That those who follow the Faith of our <HI>Father Abraham, which he had, yet being uncircumcised,</HI> will have Right∣eousness imputed unto them, as he had, and be numbered among the <HI>Blessed,</HI> tho' they are not of the Circumcision.</P>
<P>The GOSPEL is also very proper for the Occasion, which, as it mentions the <HI>Circumci∣sing of the Child after eight Days,</HI> is exactly suit∣able to the Feast of the Circumcision.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Of the</HI> EPIPHANY.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HIS Day is called by the Church <HI>the Epiphany,</HI> which in <HI>Greek</HI> sig∣nifies <HI>Manifestation.</HI> It is called in our Common-Prayer Book, parti∣cularly, <HI>the Manifestation of Christ to the</HI> Gentiles; because on this Day our Lord was manifested to the Gentile World, by the appearing of <HI>a Star</HI> to the Wise Men in the East that they might be conducted to Worship their Saviour.</P>
<P>THE Collect is very suitable, and full of Devotion, and begs of God, who by a Star, manifested his Son Jesus to the Gentiles, to grant us after this Life, the Fruition of himself, whom we only know now by Faith.</P>
<P>The EPISTLE answers the Nature of the Sea∣son, and tells us, <HI>that the Gentiles should be fel∣low Heirs, and of the same Body, and Partakers of his Promise in Christ by the Gospel, and that St.</HI> Paul <HI>preach'd among the Gentiles, the unsearch∣ble Riches of Christ.</HI></P>
<P>The GOSPEL is the History of the Star's Appearing to the <HI>Wise men in the East,</HI> and how it guided them to the Place where our Saviour was.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="24"/>BUT this is not the only <HI>Manifestation,</HI> which the Church commemorates this Day; there are other two besides; one the <HI>Manifesta∣tion,</HI> of the most <HI>glorious Trinity</HI> at his <HI>Baptism,</HI> the other that of his own <HI>Divinity,</HI> when he turn'd the Water into Wine, <HI>at the Marriage of</HI> Cana <HI>in Gallilee.</HI> The First of these the Church commemorates in the second Lesson at <HI>Morning Prayer,</HI> and the <HI>Latter</HI> in the second Lesson at <HI>Evening.</HI> The Reason why the Church celebrates these three <HI>Manifestations</HI> on this Day of the <HI>Epiphany,</HI> is, because they all happened upon this same Day,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Durand. Lib. 6. de Fest. Ep.</HI></NOTE> tho' in different Years.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The first SUNDAY after the <HI>Epiphany.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Collect prays that we may have a right Knowledge of our Duty, and suffici∣ent Strength to perform it.</P>
<P>The EPISTLE mentions the Things the Collect prays for, and is first an Exhortation to Mortification and Chastity: 2dly, to the <HI>Re∣newing of our Minds</HI> and thereby in Effect, to hope, Prayer and Obedience: 3dly, to Unity, <HI>as we are Members one of another.</HI> Now these three Things are the Virtues pointed out to us, by the Wise Men's Offerings. The <HI>Myrrh</HI> they offer'd signifies the First; The <HI>Incense</HI> they offer'd signifies the Second; And the <HI>Gold</HI> they offered signifies the Third. How suitable then is this <HI>Epistle</HI> to this Season! For in the Gospel for the <HI>Epiphany</HI> we have the <HI>Wise Men</HI> making their
<PB N="20" REF="25"/>Offerings, and in this Epistle for the Sunday following, we are exhorted to imitate them.</P>
<P>The GOSPEL of this Day, is also very suitable to the Season: For as this Sunday is the next after the <HI>Epiphany,</HI> so the First memorable Action we meet with of our Saviour in his youn∣ger Years, is this of his Coming up to <HI>Jerusa∣salem</HI> at <HI>Twelve Years of Age,</HI> and disputing with the <HI>Jewish</HI> Doctors. At<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Comber. in Catechis.</NOTE> thirteen Years of Age, the Jews were wont to bring their Children to the House of God, there to be publickly examined; and being then approv'd, they were then declared to be <HI>Children of the Precept,</HI> that is, obliged to keep the Law. And whereas our Saviour came up at twelve Years old, it was because of his Pre∣gnancy, according to that saying of the Rabbins, <HI>the Ingenious do run before the Command.</HI></P>
<P>IT is observalbe, that as from <HI>Christmass to Epiphany,</HI> the Church in her Offices sets forth Christ's Humanity, so from the <HI>Epiphany,</HI> to <HI>Septuagesima,</HI> she sets forth his Divinity. In the present Gospel it is <HI>Manifested,</HI> when he says to his Mother, <HI>Wist ye not that I must be about my Father's Business?</HI> For he says in another Place, <HI>all Things that the Father hath are mine;</HI> and there∣fore he attests, that in the same Manner the Tem∣ple belonged to his Father, it belonged to him. <HI>Bed. in Dom post Epiph.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The second SUNDAY after the <HI>Epiphany.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Collect having acknowledged God, who wrought the Miracle in the Gospel, <HI>to be the Governour of all Things in Heaven and Earth,</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="26"/>prays <HI>that the would mercifully hear the Supplica∣tions of his People, and grant them that Peace all the Days of their Life,</HI> which the Epistle puts them into the Method of acquiring.</P>
<P>The EPISTLE also is conformable to our Saviour's Goodness in the Gospel, and adviseth us to a Right Use of the <HI>Gifts</HI> God hath bestow∣ed on us, of whatsoever Kind they be; that we should not keep them to our selves, but make them of Service and Advantage to others: <HI>That we should be kindly affectioned one to another, with Brotherly Love, and of the same Mind one to∣wards another.</HI></P>
<P>The GOSPEL gives us and Example of our Saviour's Goodness, in supplying the Wants and Necessities of others, by his <HI>Turning the Water into Wine.</HI> It is used on this Day, as being the History of our Saviour's first Miracle, and there∣fore what most naturally follows his Going up to <HI>Jerusalem:</HI> And because also it manifests, (as is observ'd above, the <HI>Sundays after the Epiphany</HI> do manifest) the Divinity of our Lord; For it is only in the Power of God to change the Nature of Things.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The third SUNDAY after the <HI>Epiphany.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Collect, considering the <HI>Mercy</HI> of our Lord in the Gospel, desires God <HI>mercifully to look upon our Infirmities;</HI> and from his<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Gosp.</NOTE> <HI>Putting forth his Hand to cleanse the Leper,</HI> it prays, that he would be pleased <HI>to stretch forth his Right Hand</HI> to defend us in Dangers and help us in Necessities.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="27"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">Durand. in Domin. <HI>3</HI> post Epiph.</NOTE> The EPISTLE, tho' at first Sight it seems not any Way agreeable to the Gos∣pel; yet if taken in the mystical Sense, will appear very suitable to it; For as the Gospel relates our Saviour's Cure of the Leper, so the Epistle tells us how we may prevent the <HI>Leprosy of Sin. Be not wise in your own Conceits,</HI> will teach us how to prevent the Leprosy of Pride, and <HI>recompence to no Man Evil for Evil,</HI> how we may not be infected with Envy and Malice.</P>
<P>The GOSPEL is the History of our Lord's Curing the <HI>Leper,</HI> and the Centurion's Servant who was sick of the <HI>Palsie.</HI> It seems to have been pitched upon as suitable after our Lord's <HI>Epiphany,</HI> as being a clear Manifestation of his Divinity. In the Cure of the <HI>Leper</HI> he shewed forth his Almighty Power, and in curing the o∣ther at a Distance, he gave an undeniable Proof of his Omni-presence.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The fourth SUNDAY after the <HI>Epiphany.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Collect is founded upon the Gospel, and because <HI>we are set,</HI> as were the Disci∣ples of our Lord, amidst Waves and Storms, and since <HI>through the Weakness of our Nature,</HI> we often, as they did, imagine <HI>we perish;</HI> it there∣fore prays God <HI>to support us in all Dangers, and carry us through all Temptations,</HI> as our Lord sup∣ported his Disciples in the midst of Seas and Tempests.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="28"/>The EPISTLE, if rightly consider'd, is not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsuitable to the Gospel; It speaks the Power <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Christ upon Earth by <HI>His Ministers,</HI> as the Gospel does that of his own Word upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea; and as by the later he asswages the Winds <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd Waves, and makes <HI>a great Calm,</HI> so by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ormer, he asswages the swelling Waves of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>empestuous World, and becalms and quiets <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Madness of the People.</HI></P>
<P>The GOSPEL seems to have been chosen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or this Season, because it is a Manifestation of our Saviour's Divinity: His Commanding of the Winds and Seas, speaks him to be no other than He at <HI>whose Word the stormy Wind ariseth, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>steth up the Waves thereof, and who maketh the Storm to cease, so that the Waves thereof are still.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The fifth SUNDAY after the <HI>Epiphany.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Collect prays for such Holy Men as are mentioned in the Epistle, for <HI>the merciful and meek and charitable;</HI> which constitute <HI>the Church</HI> and Houshold of GOD.</P>
<P>THE EPISTLE exhorts us to be Part of that <HI>Houshold,</HI> by putting on the Bowels of <HI>Mercy and Kindness, and above all Charity, which is the very Bond of perfectness.</HI></P>
<P>The GOSPEL under a Parable, mentions the last <HI>Manifestation or Epiphany of our Saviour,</HI> viz. his Coming to Judgment; when the <HI>Tares,</HI> will be burnt, but the <HI>Wheat gathered into the Barn.</HI> The Angels, who are here called the
<PB N="24" REF="29"/><HI>Reapers,</HI> shall at the <HI>Time of Harvest,</HI> or at the End of the World, gather together the <HI>Tares,</HI> which are the Emblems of the Wicked, that they may be burnt; But they shall gather the <HI>Wheat,</HI> that is, just Men, into God's <HI>Barn, to the general Assembly of the first Born, where<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Thes.</HI> 1. iv. 17.</NOTE> they shall ever be with the Lord.</HI></P>

<P>THE Collect desires God in the Words of the <HI>Epistle; whose Son was manifested to destroy the Works of the Devil, and make us the Sons of God, that having this Hope, we may purify our selves, even as he is pure, and that when our Lord shall appear in the Power and great Glory,</HI> men∣tioned in the Gospel, we may enjoy what the
<PB N="25" REF="30"/>Epistle tells us will be the Portion of good Men, viz. <HI>to be made like unto him,</HI> in his eternal and glorious Kingdom.</P>
<P>The EPISTLE very suitably to the Season of the <HI>Epiphany,</HI> mentions our Saviour's first Ma∣festation, and tells us, <HI>He was manifested to destroy the Works of the Devil.</HI> And it also very suitably (as this is the last Sunday after the E∣piphany) in Conformity to the Gospel, takes notice of our Saviour's last Appearance, and tells us, <HI>We shall then be like him, and see him as he is.</HI></P>
<P>The GOSPEL treats of the last Epiphany of our Saviour, and is therefore very fitly adap∣ted to this Sunday, it being, as it was just now observ'd in the Epistle, the last Sunday after the <HI>Epiphany.</HI> The Collect prays that we may be with him in his Kingdom; The Epistle shews, <HI>that if we would see him as he is, we must purifie our selves,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>THERE are many Reasons given by the <HI>Roman Ritualists</HI> for the Names of this and the two following Sundays, the most probable of which seems both to them and others to be

<P>THE Design of the Church in setting ap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> this Time, was to prepare her Members for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Lent Fast.</HI> And therefore former the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Dur. in Septuag.</NOTE> <HI>Regulars</HI> began to fast after <HI>Septuagesima,</HI> the <HI>Greeks</HI> after <HI>Sex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣gesima,</HI> the <HI>Clergy</HI> after <HI>Quinquagesima,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> whole Christian Church on <HI>Ash-Wednesday.</HI></P>

<P>The EPISTLE before persuades us to the Duty of Pennance and Austerity, and the pre∣sent Epistle gives us a noble Example for our Imitation, that of the Sufferings of the <HI>Great St. Paul,</HI> who, by having in him <HI>that Trust,</HI> which the <HI>Collect</HI> mentions, surmounted the greatest of Dangers, and bravely underwent the most mor∣tifying Pennance. <HI>He suffered Stripes and Impri∣sonment and Deaths oft, he was beaten and stoned and suffered Shipwrack, a Night and a Day he had been in the Deep;</HI> in a Word, he endur'd the greatest Hardships of Earth and Sea.

<P><PB N="28" REF="33"/>The GOSPEL is the Parable of the Sower, and answers of the Epistle, in telling us the Dan∣gers we are in, when we neglect the Duties the Apostle St. <HI>Paul</HI> was so eminent an Example of.

<P>THE Collect for this Sunday prays for the most excellent Gift of Charity, which is so beautifully commended in the Epistle.</P>
<P>The EPISTLE is very suitably chosen by the Church; For the two last Sundays having proposed to our Imitation in the Coming <HI>Lent,</HI> some of the sublimest Acts of Mortification, and given us one of the greatest Examples of it, she now treats of Charity, the very Bond of Peace and of all Virtues, to shew us, that all the Doings of Austerity and Pennance, <HI>without Cha∣rity are nothing Worth.</HI></P>

<P>THE Reason of its continuing forty Days is because that forty Days were of old, the al∣lowed and stated Times of great Fasts; Witness the Fasts of <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Elias;</HI> But the chief Rea∣son with us, is, that our Saviour Fasted forty Days.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="35"/>IT always ends at <HI>Easters,</HI> to point out to us, that as our Saviour's Sufferings were done a∣way at his Resurrection; so after the Troubles of this Life, which are shadowed out by the Time of <HI>Lent,</HI> we shall enjoy Peace and Rest, and a glorious Resurrection, which are shadowed out to us by <HI>Easter.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is called <HI>Ash Wednesday,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Wheat Com. Prayer.</NOTE> from a Custom in the ancient Discipline (the Loss of which Cu∣stom or Godly Discipline, our Church laments in her Office for this Day, called the <HI>Commina∣tion</HI>) which began to be very early exercised on this Day, an Account whereof, we have in <HI>Gra∣tian,</HI> as follows.</P>
<P><Q>ON the first Day of <HI>Lent,</HI> the Penitents were to present themselves before the <HI>Bishop,</HI> cloathed with Sackcloth, with naked Feet and Eyes turn'd to the Ground; And this was to be done in the Presence of the principal Cler∣gy of the Diocess, who were to judge of the Sincerity of their Repentance. These intro∣duced them into the Church, where the Bi∣shop all in Tears, and the Rest of the Clergy, repeated the seven Penitential Psalms; Then rising from Prayers, they threw Ashes upon them, and covered their Heads with Sackcloth, and then with mournful Sighs declar'd to them, that as <HI>Adam</HI> was thrown out of Pa∣radise, so they must be thrown out of the Church. Then the Bishop commanded the Officers to turn them out of the Church Doors, and all the Clergy followed after, repeating that Curse upon <HI>Adam, In the Sweat of thy Brows thou shalt eat thy Bread.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="36"/>THE Collect for this Day, prays that God would send us, <HI>new and contrite Hearts,</HI> that we may lament our Sins in a sincere and unfeigned Manner, and so obtain the Pardon and Remissi∣on of them.</P>
<P>THE Portion of Scripture for the Epistle is taken out of the Prophet <HI>Joel,</HI> and exhorts us to what the Collect prays for, <HI>viz. to turn to the Lord with all our Hearts, to fast and weep, and mourn, and to rent our Hearts;</HI> And then to rest assured, that the <HI>God of all Mercy will repent him of the Evil,</HI> and give us perfect Remission and Forgiveness.</P>
<P>The GOSPEL cautions us to be sorrowful in the Manner the Epistle mentions, lest if we appear only with the external Signs of Sorrow, we receive the Reward of the Hypocrites, <HI>who only disfigure their Faces, that they may appear to Men to fast.</HI> It may also teach us, that as we hope God will be merciful to us, we should al∣so be merciful to the Poor, by giving to them what we save by Fasting. If we do so, we lay up <HI>Treasure in Heaven;</HI> if not, it is only <HI>Treasure which the Moth and Rust doth corrupt,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The first Sunday in <HI>Lent.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Collect is a Prayer to Christ, which shews the Church believes him to be God. It is very suitable to this Season of Fasting and Abstinence, and prays our Lord, that in Imita∣tion of his Fasting <HI>forty Days and forty Nights,</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="37"/>we may <HI>by his Grace use such Abstinence, as to subdue the Flesh to the Spirit, and so ever obey his Godly Motions.</HI></P>
<P>The EPISTLE exhorts us to <HI>Patience in all Things,</HI> belonging to our Spiritual Warfare, whether <HI>we be in Afflictions, in Watchings, in Fastings,</HI> or whatever Condition else.</P>
<P>The GOSPEL is the History of our Savi∣our's being tempted, and his Conquest over Temptations; and is therefore highly suitable for our Entrance on our spiritual Combat in this Season of Lent, our great <HI>Day of Battle,</HI> as it emboldens and animates us with the Hopes of Victory against our spiritual Enemies. For we know in that <HI>he himself suffered and was tempted, he is able to succour them which are tempted.</HI></P>
<P>THE Epistle and Gospel are also not unsui∣table to the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">There be four <HI>Ember-Weeks,</HI> call'd in Latin <HI>Je∣junia Quatu∣or temporum,</HI> The Fasts of the four Sea∣sons; because they were kept in the four Parts of the Year, <HI>Spring, Sum∣mer, Autumn, Winter.</HI> The First of these begins upon <HI>Wednesday,</HI> next after <HI>Ash-Wednesday;</HI> the 2d upon <HI>Wednes∣day,</HI> next after <HI>Whitsunday;</HI> the 3d upon <HI>Wednesday,</HI> next after <HI>Holy-Cross, Sept.</HI> 14. The last upon <HI>Wednesday</HI> next af∣ter St. <HI>Lucy, Dec.</HI> 13. The Days of Fasting and Prayers in those Weeks, are <HI>Wednesday, Friday</HI> and <HI>Saturday: Wed∣nesday,</HI> because then our Lord was betrayed by <HI>Judas; Fryday,</HI> because then he was crucified; <HI>Saturday,</HI> because then we represent the Apostles Sorrows for the Loss of their Lord, lying in the Grave. The Causes of such re∣ligious Fastings and Prayers were formerly many, as namely: That Christians in these religious Duties might let the World know, that they were as devout as the <HI>Jews</HI> had formerly been, whose Custom it was, to observe four solemn Fasts, <HI>Zach.</HI> 8.9. that they might dedicate to God as the first Fruits, the Beginning of the several Seasons of the Year, set a part to his religious Worship, and by this Means obtain God's Blessing upon them, the Remainders of those Times. But the principal Cause was, for Prepa∣ration to the solemn Ordination of Ministers; Holy Church imitating the Apostles Practice, who when they were to set <HI>apart Men to the Ministry, prayed and fasted</HI> be∣fore they laid on their Hands, <HI>Act.</HI> xiii. 3. <HI>Spar, Rat, Com,</HI> Pr.</NOTE> <HI>Ember-Week</HI> begin∣ning on this Day. The Epistle shews how a Minister should be∣have himself in his Calling; and the Gospel what he must expect to meet with after he has enter'd on it. No sooner did our Saviour enter on his publick Ministry, than he was <HI>temp∣ted of the Devil;</HI> and we know, <HI>the Servant is not greater than his Lord.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The second SUNDAY in <HI>Lent.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Collect after acknowledging from the Petition of the Woman in the Gospel, <HI>viz. Lord help me,</HI> that we have no Power, of our sel∣ves <HI>to help our selves,</HI> prays God, that he would keep us outwardly in our Bodies from all Adver∣sities, and inwardly in our Souls from all evil Thoughts.</P>
<P>The EPISTLE exhorts us to avoid all Un∣cleaness, and be studious of Holiness; which is undoubtedly very fit Advice at this Season, when we are more particularly assaulted <HI>both outwardly in our Bodies and inwardly in our Souls.</HI></P>
<P>The GOSPEL put us into the Method of obtaining what the Epistle persuades us to, by giving us the Story of our Lord's Curing the Woman and <HI>Canaan</HI>'s Daughter that was vexed
<PB N="34" REF="39"/>with a Devil. As she by her steady Faith and earnest Prayer, crying, <HI>Have Mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of</HI> David, <HI>and Lord help me,</HI> got the Devil thrown out of her Daughter; so may we, in like Manner, be disposess'd of the <HI>uncle all Spirit</HI> of Lust and Incontinence.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The third SUNDAY in <HI>Lent</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Collect with a View to the <HI>Finger of God,</HI> and <HI>that stronger Man</HI> mentioned in the Gospel, desires God to stretch forth <HI>the right Hand of his Majesty,</HI> to be our Defence against all our Enemies.</P>
<P>AS the Season of Pennance is thus far ad∣vanced, the Church is careful that her Sons should not flag, but rise in their Piety; and therefore the Epistle does not only persuade us to <HI>avoid Fornication,</HI> and Sins of a deeper Col∣our, <HI>but even foolish Talking and Jesting, which are not convenient;</HI> both as they are unbecoming the Gravity of this penitential Season, and are sinful in their own Nature.</P>
<P>The GOSPEL confirms the Advice of the Epistle, and Endeavours after our Continuance in our holy Violences, by shewing us the Danger of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>II</HI> Pet. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>3.</HI></NOTE> <HI>falling from our own Stedfastness, and how needful it is for us to grow in Grace.</HI> For it assures us, <HI>If the unclean Spirit, which hath been once cast out of a Man, eater into him again, the last State of that Man is then worse than the First.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="40"/>This GOSPEL, as it aims at our Keeping out the unclean Spirit when he is once dispos∣sessed, is very fitly placed after that of the last Sunday, which shews us the Way of getting him cast out.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The fourth SUNDAY in <HI>Lent.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the last Sundays Office the Church laid be∣fore us the Danger of Lapsing from the Au∣sterities of the Season; and having now brought us to the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">This Sun∣day is called Midlent-Sun∣day.</NOTE> Middle of the thorny Way of Mortification, she chears and comforts us with the <HI>End of our Journey, and the Pro∣mise of Refreshment,</HI> lest we faint upon the Road.</P>
<P>THE Collect having acknowledged, that for our evil Deeds we worthily deserve to be pu∣nished, prays God, that we may mercifully be <HI>relieved</HI> by the Comfort of his Grace.</P>
<P>The EPISTLE encourages us to go on chearfully in our holy Pennance and Hardships, as it tells us of <HI>the</HI> Jerusalem <HI>which is above, which is free</HI> from all these Troubles, and where we shall be <HI>relieved</HI> with everlasting Comforts.</P>
<P>The GOSPEL tells of Christ's <HI>Relieving</HI> the five Thousand miraculously; intimating to us, that after the Hunger we suffer here, we shall be refreshed by our Lord. <HI>For blessed are they that hunger and thirst after Righteousness, for they shall be filled.</HI> There is also another Reason
<PB N="36" REF="41"/>of this Gospels being read at this Time, which see in the 7th Sunday after Trinity.</P>
<P>THIS Sunday is also called <HI>Dominica de Panibus, the Sunday of the Loaves;</HI> or <HI>Dominica Refectionis,</HI> the Sunday of <HI>Refreshment:</HI> Because it does not treat of Mortification, but tells of the <HI>heavenly</HI> Jerusalem, and that Refreshment our Saviour will there give us. Mr. <HI>Wheatley</HI> says,<Q>or perhaps it is so called from the first Lesson in the Morning, which gives us the History of <HI>Joseph</HI>'s Entertaining his Brethren.</Q> And he adds,<Q>That the Appointment of the Gospel, and the first Lesson for this Day, might probably give the first Rise to a Custom still retain'd in many Parts of <HI>England,</HI> and well known by the Name of <HI>Midlenting or Mothering.</HI></Q></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The fifth SUNDAY in <HI>Lent.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS Sunday is called <HI>Passion-Sunday,</HI> be∣cause as the Ritualists tell us, what the <HI>Jews</HI> transacted on <HI>Good-Friday,</HI> was begun on Ye∣sterday Evening. <HI>From <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">John <HI>ii.</HI></NOTE> that Day it was that they took Council together to put him to Death; and after this Jesus walked no more openly among the</HI> Jews <HI>till</HI> Palm-Sunday. On this Sunday therefore is very justly celebra∣ted the Beginning of his Passion, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Durand. in Dom. Pass. Rup. in Dom. Pass.</NOTE> which follows on <HI>Good-Friday,</HI> as a Corps after a pompous Train of Mourners.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="42"/>THE Collect prays, that God of His Mercy would preserve our Bodies and Souls.</P>
<P>The EPISTLE relates to our Saviour's Pas∣sion, and tells us of the Benefit we have obtain∣ed <HI>by the Shedding of his Blood: How he thereby entered into the holy Place, and obtained eternal Redemption for us, that we might receive the Pro∣mise of eternal Inheritance.</HI> It very suitably <NOTE N="§" PLACE="marg">Rupert. de. Div. Offic. <HI>l. 5. c. 4.</HI></NOTE> represents to us what is to come, as it were, at the Day of our Lord's Passion, <HI>viz.</HI> a Derelicti∣on of the old <HI>Jewish</HI> Priesthood, <HI>By the Medi∣ator himself of the new Covenant, and the High Priest of a New Sacrifice.</HI></P>
<P><Q>The GOSPEL says Bp. <HI>Sparrow,</HI> treats of our Lord's being slandered by the <HI>Jews,</HI> which must needs be a Thorn in his Side, and a Part of his Passion.</Q> And some of the Ritualists observe, That this Gospel in it's my∣stical Meaning, is somewhat answerable to the Epistle: For when it is said, <HI>Then took they up Stones to cast at him,</HI> it is added, <HI>Then Jesus hid himself, and went out of the Temple.</HI> By which is represented, that <HI>Truth is self</HI> was hid to them, because they dispised his Words; and that he had now forsaken the <HI>Jewish Temple,</HI> and was, as the Epistle has it, <HI>become an High Priest of good Things to come, by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle, not made with Hands.</HI> And when our Lord says in the Gospel, <HI>which of you convinceth me of Sin?</HI> It is agreeable to that of St. <HI>Paul</HI> in the Epistle, <HI>That Christ offered him∣self without Spot to God,</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<PB N="38" REF="43"/>
<HEAD>The sixth SUNDAY in <HI>Lent.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS Sunday has the Name of <HI>Palm-Sunday,</HI> because it was on this Day our Lord rode in Triumph to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> when the People took <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>John</HI> xii. 13.</NOTE> the Branches of <HI>Palm-Trees,</HI> and went forth to meet him, and cryed, <HI>Hosanna, Blessed is the King of</HI> Israel <HI>that cometh in the Name of the Lord.</HI> It was a Custom in the ancient Church to go in Proces∣sion on this Day, bearing <HI>Palms</HI> in their Hands; and it was also observed in our own, till the <HI>Reformation,</HI> when it was abolished, because of the Superstitions attending it.</P>
<P>THE Collect, from these Words in the Epistle, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Epist.</NOTE> <HI>Let this same Mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus—Who was made in the Likeness of Men, and humbled him∣self, and became obedient to Death, even the Death of the Cross,</HI> prays God, <NOTE N="§" PLACE="marg">Coll.</NOTE> <HI>Who sent our Savior Jesus Christ to take upon him our Flesh, and to suffer Death upon the Cross, that all Mankind should follow the Exam∣ple of his great Humility;</HI> that he would merci∣fully grant that we may follow his Example, or<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="marg">Epist.</NOTE> <HI>be of the same Mind with him,</HI> and so partake of his <HI>Resurrection.</HI></P>
<P>The EPISTLE advises to what the Collect prays for, when it says, <HI>let this same Mind be in you, which was in Christ Jesus;</HI> that is, do ye <HI>humble</HI> your selves, as he did, and so ye may be partakers, as it were, the Sunday following, of his Resurrection.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="44"/>The GOSPEL is the History of our Savi∣our's Passion, and gives us the Particulars of what the Epistle recommends to our Imitation. The <HI>Gospel</HI> then shews our Lord's Patience and Sufferings; the <HI>Epistle</HI> persuades us to imitate them; and the <HI>Collect</HI> prays for God's assistance in following his Example.</P>
<P>THIS Week is called the <HI>Great,</HI> the <HI>Holy,</HI> and the <HI>painful Week.</HI> The <HI>Great,</HI> as being that in which were transacted the great Affairs of Man's Salvation; the <HI>Holy,</HI> as being that which was spent in the Exercise of Prayer, Meditati∣on, frequenting the Church, stricter Fasting then usual, and greater Actions of Charity; and the <HI>painful,</HI> as being that in which our Lord under∣went such exceeding Pains and Tortures for the Sins of the whole World. Our Church comes as near as she can to the Devotions of the anci∣ent Christians in this Week of Humiliation, by setting apart for every Day a particular Service suitable to the Occasion.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The Thursday before <HI>Easter.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS Day is called <HI>Maundy-Thursday,</HI> from that <HI>new Commandment</HI> our Lord gave his Disciples, to love one another. On this Day he <HI>washed</HI> his Disciples <HI>Feet,</HI> and therefore the second Lesson for the Morning, is the History of that Transaction: On this Day also he insti∣tuted the Sacrament of his <HI>Body and Blood,</HI> and therefore the <HI>Epistle</HI> gives an Account of that
<PB N="40" REF="45"/>Institution. The Gospel is very suitable, being as the others, the History of our Saviour's Pas∣sion.</P>
<P>THIS <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Spar. Rat.</NOTE> Day the Penitents, that were put out of the Church upon <HI>Ash-Wednesday,</HI> were received again into it, for this Reason chiefly, because on this Day our Lord was apprehended and bound, which Bind∣ing wrought our Deliverance and Freedom.</P>
<P>THE Form of reconciling Penitents, was in short this. The Bishop goes out to the Doors of the Church, where the Penitents lie prostrate upon the Earth, and thrice in the Name of Christ he calls them, <HI>Come, come, come, ye Chil∣dren, hearken to me, I will teach you the Fear of the Lord.</HI> Then after he had prayed for them, and admonished them, he reconciles them, and brings them into the Church. The Penitents thus received, trim their Heads and Beards, and laying of their penitential Weeds, they recloath themselves in handsome Apparel.</P>
<P>THE Church Doors were wont to be set o∣pen all this Day, to signifie that penitent Sin∣ners coming from <HI>North</HI> or <HI>South,</HI> or any Quar∣ter of the World, shall be received to Mercy, and the Churches Favour.</P>

<P>THIS Day was observed in the ancient Church, as one of the strictest Fasts in the Year, in Memory of our Saviour's Lying in the Grave, and the Sorrow of the Apstoles, <HI>Who when the Bridegroom was taken away from them,
<PB N="43" REF="48"/>did fast in those Days.</HI> The Church of <HI>England</HI> in Imitation of that, advises us also to a strict Fast in private, and calls us to the Place of Wor∣ship, by the publick Office of the Day, to im∣ploy our selves in meditating on our Saviour's <HI>Burial and Descent into Hell.</HI></P>
<P>THE Collect prays in a most mov∣ing and solemn Manner, that <NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom.</HI> vi. 3.</NOTE> <HI>as we are baptised into Christ's Death;</HI> so by con∣tinual mortifying our corrupt Affecti∣ons, <HI>We</HI> <NOTE N="§" PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom.</HI> vi. 4.</NOTE> <HI>may be buried with him,</HI> and not fear the Grave, but pass joyfully thro' it to our Resurrection.</P>
<P>The EPISTLE treats of the Descent of our Saviour's Soul into Hell, that is, into the Mansions of holy Souls, <HI>Where <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="marg">Epist.</NOTE> he went and preached unto the Spirits in Prison,</HI> Where <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">By. <HI>Tay∣lor</HI>'s Antiq.

<P>The GOSPEL treats of our Saviour's Bo∣dy, as the Epistle does of his Soul, and is an Account of his <HI>Burial,</HI> as the Gospel of Yester∣day was of his <HI>Death.</HI> It tells us also of what happened after he was interr'd, and ends in such a Manner, by telling us, <HI>That they went and made the Sepulchre sure, sealing the Stone, and setting a Watch,</HI> that we leave reading it with heavy Hearts, and forced away, as it were, mourning from the Sepulchre.</P>

<P>IT is the highest of Festivals, as bringing us the comfortable News of our Lord's, and in due Time of our own Resurrection. In the Season before, the Church was in Mourning and Sorrow, an Emblem of the Troubles of the present Life; but now, on the Day of her Savi∣our's Resurrection, the Emblem of our future Happiness in the Kingdom of Heaven, she is in the compleatest Joy. Whereas therefore it was always Customary in the primitive Times to be in Sorrow for the Season of <HI>Lent,</HI> especially in the <HI>Holy Week,</HI> when they beheld the <HI>Passion,</HI> and bewailed at the <HI>Cross,</HI> and sat weeping by the <HI>Sepulchre;</HI> it was now usual to shew Tokens of the greatest Joy, and therefore their morn∣ing Salutation was, <HI>The Lord is Risen,</HI> and the Answer was, <HI>The Lord is Risen indeed,</HI> or, <HI>and</HI>

<P>The EPISTLE directs us how to obtain what the Collect prays for, when it advises us, <HI>To mortifie our Members which are upon the Earth, and to set our Affections on the Things above; for if we be risen with Christ, we must seek those Things which are above.</HI></P>

<P>IN the primitive Times the Feast of <HI>Easter</HI> was solemnized even till <HI>Whitsunday,</HI> in honour of our Lord's Resurrection; afterwards the whole Week following was observed, which our Church approves of, by appointing a Preface in the Communion-Office for eight Days following;

<P>The EPISTLE gives and Account of our Saviour's Resurrection from St. <HI>Peter,</HI> who tells us, <HI>That he was raised up the third Day, that he was seen of them, whom God had chosen Witnesses, and that they eat and drank with him after his Resurrection.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Epistle is conveniently and judicious∣ly placed before this Gospel, as it contains the Words of <HI>Peter,</HI> who had the Honour of seeing his Lord, before <HI>the two Disciples,</HI> or any of the Apostles.</P>
<P>The GOSPEL is the History of what hap∣pened on the Afternoon of our Saviour's Resur∣rection, <HI>viz.</HI> his Walking to <HI>Emmaus</HI> with the <HI>two Disciples,</HI> and his <HI>Discovering himself to them in the Breaking of Bread.</HI></P>

<P><Q>THIS Sunday is called <HI>Low-Sunday,</HI> because it is <HI>Easter</HI> repeated,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Spar. Rat.</NOTE> the <HI>Octave</HI> of <HI>Easter;</HI> but the Sun∣day before is <HI>High-Easter,</HI> and this a lower Feast, <HI>Low-Easter.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THE Collect prays for such Purity and Ho∣liness, as may intitle us to a Share in our Lord's Resurrection.</P>
<P>The EPISTLE adviseth those <HI>who are born of God,</HI> or Baptized into the Faith of Christ, to <HI>overcome the World,</HI> as they promised when they were Baptized.</P>
<P>THE Reason why the Church chuses this Epistle for this Season, is, because it was proper for those who were Baptised on <NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">The Anci∣ents had only two Times of Baptizing viz the <HI>Eves</HI> of <HI>Easter</HI> and <HI>Whitsunday</HI> except in Ca∣ses of Necessi∣ty. <HI>Ber. Au∣giens. c. 3.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Easter-Eve;</HI> who came to Church every Day in <HI>Easter-Week</HI> with <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="marg">These <HI>Lights</HI> were an Em∣blem of the Ilumination they had ac∣quired by Ba∣ptism; and the <HI>White Ve∣stures,</HI> other∣wise called <HI>Chrisms,</HI> were an Emblem of their inward Purity by Baptism. The Vestures being laid aside this Day, gives if the Name of <HI>Dominica in albis,</HI> or, <HI>the Sunday of saying aside the White Vestures.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Lights</HI> before them, and clad in white Vestures, which they laid aside <HI>this Day</HI> in the Church, that they might rise up in Judgment against them, if they af∣terwards violated the Faith they pro∣fessed in their Baptism. This Epi∣stle therefore was very suitable, as putting them in Mind of what they promised.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="53"/>The GOSPEL is answerable to the Season, and as the Sunday is <HI>Low-Sunday,</HI> or <HI>Low-Ea∣ster,</HI> so it treats of our Lord's Resurrection.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The second SUNDAY after <HI>Easter.</HI></HEAD>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Durand. in Dom. Secu. a Pasch.</NOTE> AS by the Resurrection, not on∣ly the young and newly Baptized were instructed, but also the Grown and the Mature: This Sunday there∣fore treats of those who are arrived at Maturi∣ty, as the Sunday before did of those who had not so far advanced. It treats of the Pastors of the Church, and shews them how they must follow the Example of the Lord, as the other instructed the New-born Christians, how they should imitate Christ's Resurrection, by Pure∣ness and Holiness of Life.</P>
<P>THE Collect (from these Words in the E∣pistle, <HI>because also Christ suffered for us, leaving us an Example, that we should follow his Steps,)</HI> having acknowledged, <HI>that God gave his only Son to be unto us both a Sacrifice for Sin, and also an Example of a godly Life,</HI> prays God to send us his Grace, that we may be thankful for the Be∣nefit of his Dying for us, and may also follow his Steps.</P>
<P>THE EPISTLE shews to all, the Example of our Lord's Patience and Holiness, that they may follow his Steps; For it tells us, <HI>that he suf∣fered for us, that he was reviled, that he bore our Sins in is own Body on the Tree;</HI> and it also shews us his Manner of bearing Sufferings, <HI>he did
<PB N="49" REF="54"/>no Sin, neither was any Guile found in his Mouth; her viled not, he threatned not; but committed himself to him who judgeth righteously;</HI> And so he <HI>suffered and took it patiently, which was acceptable with God.</HI></P>
<P>The GOSPEL in a more particular Man∣ner relates to the <HI>Pastors and Bishops</HI> of the Church, and sets before them our blessed Lord, <HI>the good Shepherd,</HI> for their Imitation.</P>
<P>The Epistle, and it, are parallel in several Places. The Gospel tells us, that <HI>Jesus</HI> is <HI>the good Shepherd;</HI> the Epistle, that he is the <HI>Shep∣herd and Bishop of our Souls;</HI> The Gospel, that <HI>he layeth down his Life for his Sheep;</HI> The Epistle, <HI>that he bore our Sins in his own Body on the Tree;</HI> The Gospel shews the Master foretelling, <HI>that he hath other Sheep which are not of this Fold, and that them also he wou'd bring, and they should hear his Voice, and they should be one Fold and one Shep∣herd;</HI> The Epistle shews the Servants fulfilling the Prophecy of their Lord, when it says, <HI>Ye were as Sheep going astray, but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your Souls.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The third SUNDAY after <HI>Easter.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is observable that the Collect and Epistle of this Day have a particular View to Baptism, which was undoubtedly to remind the newly baptized at <HI>Easter</HI> what Obligations they lay under, to perform their Duty.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="55"/><NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Sparr. Rat. Microl. c. <HI>56.</HI></NOTE> THE Ancients were wont to observe an Anniversary, in Comme∣moration of their Baptism, which was called <HI>Pascha Annotinum:</HI> They that were baptized at <HI>Easter</HI> the Year before, came the Year following the same Day to Church, and so∣lemnly with Oblations and other Religious Offi∣ces, commemorated the Anniversary Day of their <HI>New-Birth.</HI> Tho' our Church does not in every particular observe the same Custom, yet she draws near to the ancient Practice, in this solemn, tho' general Anniversary Commemora∣tion of Baptism this Day, minding us all this Day of our Baptism, and our Vow made there∣in, and praying to God to enable us all to keep it.</P>
<P>THE Collect is very suitable to this Com∣memoration of the Church, and prays God, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> enlightens by Baptism, <HI>that all those who ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> been admitted into the Fellowship of Christ's Religi∣on,</HI> or baptized into the Faith of Christ, may perform the Promises and Vows made in their Baptism.</P>
<P>The EPISTLE is also very suitable, and persuades the <HI>New-Born,</HI> or those whom God hath brought <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Coll.</NOTE> <HI>from Error to the Light of his Truth,</HI> to walk as Chil∣deren of Light, and to live up to what they vowed in their Baptism, <NOTE N="§" PLACE="marg">Epist.</NOTE> by ab∣staining from <HI>the Lusts of the Flesh, and having an honest Conversation among the Gen∣tiles.</HI></P>
<P>The GOSPEL is answerable to the Sea∣son
<PB N="51" REF="56"/>of our Lord's Being in the World after his Resurrection, till the Ascension. <HI>A little while and ye shall not see me,</HI> is to say, in a little while I shall be laid in my Grave, and so be taken from your Eyes, <HI>and again a little while and ye shall see me,</HI> is to say you shall see me again for a little while after my Resurrection. <HI>A little while and ye shall weep and lament</HI> for my Death, but after my Resurrection <HI>your Sorrow shall be turn'd into Joy.</HI> This Gospel therefore should represent to us the Joyfulness of this Time, by the Joy the Apostles had after our Lord was risen.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The fourth SUNDAY after <HI>Easter.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Collect considering that the Epistle says, <HI>every good and every perfect Gift com∣eth down from above,</HI> &amp;c. and therefore that what∣soever good we do is owing to the Gifts <HI>and Will</HI> of God, <NOTE N="§" PLACE="marg">Epist.</NOTE> <HI>who of his own Will begat the Apostles with the Word of Truth, that they might be a Kind of First-Fruits of his Creatures;</HI> acknowledges God to be <HI>Almighty,</HI> and <HI>that he alone can order the unruly Wills and Affections of sinful Men;</HI> and then it prays, that he would Grant the like unto his People; that they loving the Things which he commands, and desiring that which he does promise, may have their Hearts fixed upon such heavenly Ob∣jects, as redound to them from Christ's Resurrecti∣on, and the Holy Ghost the promised Comforter.</P>
<P>The EPISTLE telling us that <HI>every good and perfect Gift cometh <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>own from the Father of
<PB N="52" REF="57"/>Lights,</HI> does thereby teach us, that the <HI>Holy-Spirit</HI> and his blessed Fruits are the Gifts of God and <HI>cometh down</HI> from him; And as it tells us, that <HI>God of his own Will begat the Apostles with the Word of Truth, &amp;c.</HI> so it confirms the Promise of Christ to his Apostles in this Day's Gospel, viz. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Gosp.</NOTE> <HI>when the Spirit of Truth was come, he should Guide them into all Truth.</HI> This Epistle therefore is very suitable to this Season, in which we read the Promise of the Comforter.</P>
<P>The GOSPEL also is very suitable to this Season of our Lord's <HI>Going in and out for forty Days</HI> among his Disciples. In the Gospel before, he tells them of his Being with them <HI>a little while,</HI> in the present Gospel he tells them he must short∣ly go away, to sent unto them <HI>the Spirit of Truth to guide them into all Truth.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The fifth SUNDAY after <HI>Easter.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS Sunday has the Name of <HI>Rogation. Sunday,</HI> and is so called because of the <HI>Three Days</HI> following it, being set apart by the Church, as Days of Abstinence, and putting up of <HI>Roga∣tions and Litanies,</HI> which are Requests and Sup∣plications to God.</P>
<P>THE Reason of this Exercise at this Time, is that our Hearts and Minds may be the better prepared to <HI>Ascend with Christ</HI> the <HI>Thursday</HI> fol∣lowing, and that the Fruits of the Earth, which at this Time are young and tender, may avoid being hurt; that God would avert his Judg∣ments
<PB N="53" REF="58"/>from them, and let us enjoy them in due Season.</P>
<P>THE Collect observing in the Gospel, that <HI>Whatsoever we ask the Father in Christ's Name we shall receive,</HI> acknowledges that <HI>it is God from whom all good Things</HI> come; and then prays that he would send his Holy Ghost into our Hearts, that by <HI>his Holy Inspiration</HI> we may be puri∣fied with good Thoughts, and obtain Strength and Power to bring them to good Effect.</P>
<P>The EPISTLE teaches us how we may obtain the <HI>Comforter</HI> the Collect prays for, <HI>viz. by being Doers of the World and not Hearers</HI> only. For they who hear the Word only, are like the <HI>Seed</HI> which fell upon the <HI>Way-side,</HI> on the Rock, and among the <HI>Thorns,</HI> which were <HI>trodden down, withered away</HI> and <HI>choaked; But</HI> <NOTE N="§" PLACE="marg">Epist.</NOTE> <HI>the Doers of the</HI> Word, <HI>are</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Sexag. <HI>Sun.</HI></NOTE> <HI>they which hear the Word of God and keep it,</HI> are the <HI>Seed</HI> which fell on good Ground, which brings <HI>forth Fruit with Patience.</HI> And therefore <NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Epist.</NOTE> <HI>not a forgetful Hearer, but a Doer of the Work, shall be blessed in his Deed,</HI> or shall obtain the promised Comfor∣ter.</P>
<P>The GOSPEL before acquaints us with our Lord's Leaving the World, and sending to us the <HI>Comforter:</HI> The present Gospel shews us how we may obtain him, <HI>ask and ye shall receive that your Joy may be full.</HI> This is therefore very suitable for the Sunday before the Ascension, as it as∣sures us, that our Lord did not ascend till he had promised us a Comforter in his Stead, and shew∣ed us the Way of obtaining the Promise.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="59"/>The <NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Spar. Rat.</NOTE> GOSPEL is concerning <HI>Rogations,</HI> teaching us how to ask of God so as we may obtain, and withal foretells his approaching Ascension.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Fast</HI> this Week is voluntary, for there is no Fast commanded betwixt Easter and Whit∣sunday; all that Time being spent in Joy on Account of the Lord's Resurrection.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>ASCENSION-DAY.</HEAD>
<P>THE Church having celebrated the Resur∣rection of her Saviour, doth in a regular Course of Things come to his Ascension. She shews him, telling hid Disciples, how he would be in the World <HI>a little while,</HI> then talking of his <HI>Go∣ing away,</HI> then sending to us the <HI>Comforter,</HI> and lastly shewing us the Way and Method of ob∣taining him. And having thus celebrated these Things in her Gospels for each Sunday, she now celebrates the Day of his Ascension after all; when he visibly ascended into the Heavens with his Humane Nature, after he had been with his Disciples forty Days upon Earth.</P>
<P>THE Collect prays that God would send us Grace to imitate, as much as we are able, the Ascension of our Saviour; that as he really as∣cended in his Humane Nature, so we may also ascend in our Hearts and Minds, and dwell con∣tinually with him there.</P>
<P>The EPISTLE gives us a particular Ac∣count
<PB N="55" REF="60"/>of our Lord's Ascension, in the Presence of his Disciples; how after he had been with them forty Days, he assembled them together, and having assured them he would send them the Comforter, he ascended into Heaven.</P>
<P>The GOSPEL also is the History of our <HI>Lord's Ascension,</HI> and tells us in a particular Man∣ner how he ascended into the Heavens, and when he came there, that <HI>he sat down at the Right Hand of God.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The SUNDAY after <HI>Ascension-Day.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS Week has the Name of <HI>Expectation-Week,</HI> because now the Apostles <HI>expected</HI> the fulfilling of our Saviour's Promise of the Comforter, <HI>If I go away, I will send the Comfor∣ter to you.</HI></P>
<P>THE Collect is very suitable to the Season, and in Imitation of the Condition the Apostles were in at this Time, prays, as the Apostles may be supposed to have done, that God <HI>would not leave us comfortless;</HI> but send to us <HI>the Holy Ghost to comfort us, and exalt us into the same Place, whither our Saviour Christ is gone before.</HI></P>
<P>The EPISTLE (considering what the Col∣lect prays for, <HI>viz.</HI> that we may obtain the <HI>Com∣forter and be exalted into the Heavens</HI>) shews us the Way of obtaining both the one and the other. <HI>If we be sober, and watch unto Prayer,</HI> as it advises us, following the Examples of the A∣postles
<PB N="56" REF="61"/>at this Time, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Gosp.</NOTE> <HI>The Comfor∣ter will come unto us,</HI> according to what our Lord himself tells us, as it were a lit∣tle before his <HI>Ascension, ask and ye shall receive;</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Durand. in Dominic. p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st Ascens.</NOTE> and by <HI>good Works, by Charity and Mercy,</HI> which it also exhorts us to, we may fly after our Saviour into the Heavens, as it were from <HI>the Mount of Olives.</HI></P>
<P>The GOSPEL is the Promise of the Com∣forter, which the Epistle exhorts to pray for, and which therefore our Church does pray for, in this Day's Collect. It is suitable to this Time, as it is the Promise of the <HI>Comforter</HI> the <HI>Apostles</HI> were now <HI>expecting.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>WHITSUNDAY.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Day is called <HI>Whitsunday,</HI> because of that <HI>Light</HI> the Apostles were illuminated with by the Descent of the Holy Ghost; But it is chiefly so called, because the new baptized were wont at this Time to be cloathed with <HI>White Garments.</HI></P>
<P>It has the Name of Pentecost, because there are Fifty Days between <HI>Easter</HI> and <HI>Whitsunday,</HI> as it was Fifty Days between the <HI>Passover</HI> and the Jewish Pentecost. Among the <HI>Jews</HI> it was celebrated, because the Law was then given on <HI>Mount Sinai;</HI> and among the <HI>Christians,</HI> because on this Day the Holy Ghost was given to the Church.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="62"/>The last Sunday the Church, being as it were in <HI>Expectation</HI> of the Coming of the Comforter, prayed in the <HI>Collect</HI> that God would send him; but now the Comforter being come, she prays in this Day's Collect, that God would send <HI>her a true Judgment in all Things, and everlasting Joy in the Comfort of that Holy Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>The EPISTLE is the Relation of the Won∣derful Descent of the Holy Ghost upon the A∣postles on this Day of <HI>Pentecost, when he sat upon Each of them,</HI> in the Shape of <HI>Cloven Tongues</HI> like as of Fire, and gifted them with speaking in all Languages, <HI>the wonderful Works of God.</HI></P>
<P>The GOSPEL is very suitable for the Fe∣stival as being our Saviour's Promise of the Com∣forter, which the Epistle tells us he sent down on his Church on this Day.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>MONDAY in</HI> Whitsun-Week.</HEAD>
<P>THE Collect is the same with that of Ye∣sterday, it having been always Customary in the Week following any <HI>great Festival,</HI> to re∣peat some part of its Office.</P>
<P>THIS Week is not celebrated quite through in a Festival Manner, as was the Week of <HI>Easter;</HI> the former Part of it is only <HI>Festival,</HI> the latter Part is <HI>East.</HI> The former is <HI>Festival,</HI> because of the <HI>Descent of the</HI> Holy Ghost, and because also the Church at this <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Hugh, de Sanct. Vic. in V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> l. pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ec.</NOTE> Season perform∣ed the Office of Baptism to Converts: But the later was spent in <HI>Fasting,</HI>
<PB N="58" REF="63"/>because of the <HI>Ember-Days,</HI> the <HI>Wednesday, Fri∣day,</HI> and <HI>Saturday</HI> following, which were always observed a Fast, in Conformity to the Apostles fasting before Ordination, <HI>Act.</HI> xiii. 3.</P>
<P>AS then the Church at this Season not only celebrates the Descent of the Holy Ghost but likewise performed the Solemn Acts of <HI>Baptism,</HI> and <HI>Ordination</HI> and also <HI>Confirmation</HI> at this Sea∣son; so in her Offices for the Days, attending this great Festival, she solemnizes the Feast, and Com∣memorates the Church's Practice.</P>
<P>The EPISTLE mentions the Descent of the Holy Ghost upon the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> as <HI>Peter</HI> was prea∣ching to them, and at the Close it mentions Bap∣tism, telling us how the Gentiles were <HI>Baptized in the Name</HI> of the Lord. The Epistle therefore is very agreeable to the Season, in which we commemorate both the Descent of the <HI>Holy Spi∣rit,</HI> and the Custom of the Church of Baptizing at this Season: And therefore it lays before the <HI>Newly Baptized,</HI> the Necessity of <HI>walking as Chil∣dren of Light,</HI> and believing in Christ. <HI>For he that believeth shall not perish, but hath everlasting Life; but he that believeth not, is condemned al∣ready, because he hath not believed in the Name of the only begotten Son of God.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>TUESDAY in</HI> Whitsun-Week.</HEAD>
<P>THE Epistle, suitable to the Custom of <HI>Bap∣tizing</HI> at this Season, and of <HI>Confirming</HI> which was also now used, is concerning Baptism
<PB N="59" REF="64"/>and Confirmation; and is also very proper for the Practice of the Church, at the latter Part of the Week, the Time of fasting and praying for an holy and regular Ministry. It tells us there∣fore, that, <HI>when the Apostles had heard that</HI> Sama∣ria <HI>had received the Word of God, they sent to them</HI> Peter <HI>and</HI> John, <HI>who when they had laid their Hands on them, they received the Holy Ghost. Philip</HI> had <HI>Baptized</HI> them, but being only in the Inferior Orders, he could not give them <HI>Confir∣mation,</HI> which was the Province of <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> they being Bishop or of the Highest Order. We may see therefore how agreeable this is to the Custom of <HI>Ordaining</HI> at this Time; For it teaches us, that there is a Difference of Orders, because there is a Difference of Power: <HI>Philip</HI> could <HI>baptize,</HI> but he could not <HI>confirm;</HI> which shews, that the Power of <HI>Ordaining</HI> (being at least equally great with that of <HI>Confirming</HI>) can be lodged no where but in the Bishop, or the highest Order. This Epistle then mentions <HI>Ba∣ptism,</HI> the Descent of the <HI>Holy Ghost, Confirma∣tion,</HI> and lastly inferrs the Validity of an <HI>Episco∣pal Ordination,</HI> which is going to be performed at this Time, and so is highly suitable to the Season.</P>
<P>The GOSPEL, answerable to he <HI>Ember-Week,</HI> and the Ordination, shews which are the lawfully appointed Ministers of God, which are not; which are the <HI>Shepherds</HI> of the Sheep, which are the <HI>Thieves and Robbers;</HI> Those who enter not into the Sheepfold by Christ, who is the <HI>Door,</HI> and consequently by those whom Christ sent, <HI>as he himself was sent,</HI> but <HI>climbeth up some other Way,</HI> are the <HI>Thieves</HI> and <HI>Robbers.</HI></P>

Another Reason for observing this par∣ticular Time for the Celebration of this Festival, is, because the Lord had no sooner ascended in∣to Heaven, and the Holy Ghost descended upon the Church, than the Knowledge of the most glorious Trinity became more conspicuous than ever it was before.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="66"/>THE <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The Col∣lects of the Book of <HI>Com∣mon Prayer,</HI> may arm us with a Com∣pendious &amp; Ejaculatory Prayer of the Church's Composure, pertinent to all Occa∣sions, which may be of excellent Use to those, who desire to be always on their Guard, against the Enemy of their Souls. Thus on the third Sunday after <HI>Easter,</HI> we pray for <HI>Sincerity;</HI> On Ash-Wednesday for <HI>Contrition;</HI> On this Day for a right and firm Faith, &amp;c. Dr. <HI>Comber.</HI> Bishop <HI>Fox,</HI> the Founder of <HI>Corpus Christi</HI> College in <HI>Oxford,</HI> obli∣ges all his Fellows to repeat this Day's Collect, every Morning and Evening of their whole Life, as a Necessa∣ry Part of their private Devotions. <HI>Ex M.

<P>THIS Sunday in the ancient Church, having been the last of the Days of <HI>Baptism</HI> at this Sea∣son of <HI>Pentecost,</HI> the <NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Rupert, de Offic. Sanct.

<P>The GOSPEL also suitable to the Custom of Baptizing at this Season of <HI>Pentecost,</HI> treats of Baptism, and shews the great Necessity of it, <HI>Verily, verily I say unto you, except a Man be born of Water and of the Spirit he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God;</HI> which is exactly answerable to the Epistle, and is as much as to say, that we must sail through the <HI>Sea of Glass</HI> there mentio∣ned,
<PB N="62" REF="67"/>before we arrive at the Port of Happi∣ness, or <HI>enter into the Kindom of God,</HI> men∣tioned in the Gospel; But however, tho' it an∣swers the Epistle so exactly in the Custom of the Church, of Baptizing at this Season, yet it is still very proper for this Festival of the Blessed Trinity. For the Three Persons of the God∣head are mentioned in it, in whose Names the whole Church is baptized.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The first Sunday after <HI>Trinity.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE whole Time from <HI>Advent</HI> to <HI>Trinity-Sunday,</HI> having been chiefly spent in Com∣memorating the most remarkable Transactions of our Saviour's Life and Death, the Offices ap∣pointed by the Church were always answerable to the Occasion: And having celebrated the My∣steries of our Redemption, and proposed to our Imitation the Example of our Lord, she comes now in the Offices from <HI>Trinity Sunday,</HI> to <HI>Ad∣vent,</HI> to instruct us in our Duty, that we may follow rightly the Example which has been gi∣ven us. The Epistles and Gospels therefore of the following Sundays are instructive of an Holy Life, teaching us the Road of Virtue, and how we may avoid the By-ways of Vice; And tho' they are not suited to the Sundays they were fixed to, as the others before Trinity-Sunday are to their respective Seasons, that being im∣practicable, yet the Office for each Sunday has generally an agreeable Harmony and Fitness in itself, the Collect, Epistle and Gospel, having
<PB N="63" REF="68"/>for the most Part, some Likeness and Analogy to one another.</P>
<P>THE Collect considering, from a View of the <HI>rich Man's</HI> uncharitable Behavi∣our in the Gospel, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Coll.</NOTE> <HI>The Weakness of our mortal Nature,</HI> and therefore how of our selves, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Coll.</NOTE> <HI>we are able to do no good Thing;</HI> prays God that he would <HI>grant us the Help of his Grace, that</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="marg">Coll.</NOTE> <HI>we may keep his Commandments, or the Command∣ment of loving our Brother,</HI> mentioned in the E∣pistle, which will enable us <HI>to</HI> <NOTE N="§" PLACE="marg">Coll.</NOTE> <HI>please God both in Will and Deed.</HI></P>
<P>The EPISTLE tell us, <HI>how God sent his Son into the World, that he was the Propitiation for our Sins,</HI> and how after that, <HI>he gave us of his Spirit;</HI> by which is mentioned in short, the great Acts of our Redemptions, <HI>viz.</HI> our Sa∣viour's Brith and Death, and the Coming of the Holy Ghost; which by the Way is very suita∣ble for the first Sunday after <HI>Trinity.</HI> From those Acts of Love and Mercy, it exhorts to Charity, which the <HI>Rich Man</HI> in the Gospel wanted. For the Apostle argues, <HI>if God so lov∣ed us, we ought also to love one another: And that we cannot love God, but we must love our Brother also:</HI> That it is not enough to be holy in our Desires and Thoughts, that we may <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Coll.</NOTE> <HI>please God in Will;</HI> but we must also be charitable to our Brethren <NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Coll.</NOTE> <HI>that we may please him in Deed.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The second SUNDAY after <HI>Trinity.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Collect, as it were from these Words in the Epistle, <HI>and whatever we ask, we re∣ceive of him, because we keep his Commandments,</HI> &amp;c. having acknowledged, <HI>that God never fails to help and govern those whom he brings up in his stedfast Fear and Love;</HI> beseeches him, <HI>to keep us under the Protection of his good Providence,</HI> that we <HI>may have a perpetual Fear and Love of his Ho∣ly Name,</HI> that by the Former we may not dare to excuse our selves from <HI>the great Supper</HI> men∣tioned in the Gospel, and may by the Latter have Grace readily to accept of the Invitation.</P>
<P>The EPISTLE excites us to Actions of Charity and Love to each other, and to the Love of God; and therefore advises us, out of the A∣bundance and Affluence of Things God hath be∣stowed on us, to be merciful to our poor and
<PB N="65" REF="70"/>indigent Brethren; in Imitation, as it were of the Man in the Gospel, who brought into his <HI>Supper, the Poor and the Maimed, and the Halt and the Blind. For whos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hath this World's Good, and seeth his Brother have need, and shutteth up his Bowels of Compassion from him, how dwelleth the Love of God in him?</HI> It therefore Advises us not to love our Brethren in <HI>Word,</HI> neither in <HI>Tongue,</HI> as those loved God, who excused them∣selves from the <HI>great Supper,</HI> but to <HI>love them in Deed and in Truth,</HI> as God loved those he invi∣ted to it.</P>
<P>The GOSPEL is the Parable of the great Supper, in which is represented the wonderful Love of God to his indigent Creatures, in invi∣ting them to the good Things of his heavenly Kingdom, and the Ingratitude of the Sons of Men, in not accepting of them.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The third SUNDAY after <HI>Trinity.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Collect considering that the Epistle and Gospel shew that we are exposed to many and great Dangers, prays that <HI>we may be defen∣ded and comforted in all Dangers and Adversities.</HI></P>
<P>The EPISTLE mentions what those Dan∣gers are and shews what is requisite to support us under them. It tells us, the Dangers are the Devil and his Angels, who walk about, seeking whom they may devour; and that, <HI>by being hum∣ble, sober, and vigilant, and by casting all our Care upon God, who careth for us,</HI> we may be a∣ble <HI>to resist them.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="71"/>The GOSPEL also, under the Parable of <HI>lost Sheep,</HI> shews us the Dangers we are ex∣posed to, and that <HI>God careth for us,</HI> when we are in them. When the Devil, who is the roar∣ing Lion in the Wilderness of this World, finds one of the Sheep of Christ wandering and stray∣ing from the Flock, and not using that Vigilance the Epistle advises him to; he immediately seizes him, that <HI>he may devour him.</HI> But <HI>Jesus Christ, the good Shepherd, who careth for his Sheep, goes after that which is lost, untill he finds it;</HI> and then <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Sam.</HI> i. 17.</NOTE> <HI>delivers him out of the Jaws of the Lion,</HI> and brings him back to the Fold.</P>

<HEAD>The fourth SUNDAY after <HI>Trinity.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Collect seems from a View of the <HI>blind Guides,</HI> mentioned in the Gospel, to ac∣knowledge <HI>God the Protector of all that trust in him, and to be him without whom nothing is strong, nothing is holy;</HI> and then considering <HI>the Suffer∣ings of this present World,</HI> mentioned in the E∣pistle, and the Danger of meeting with the <HI>blind Guides</HI> in the Gospel to carry us through them, it prays God, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Gosp.</NOTE> <HI>Our Father which is merciful,</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Epist.</NOTE> <HI>that he would increase and multiply upon us his Mercy;</HI> that in∣stead of the <HI>Guides</HI> in the Gospel, <NOTE N="§" PLACE="marg">Coll.</NOTE> <HI>He would be our Ruler and Guide,</HI> that we <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="marg">Coll.</NOTE> <HI>may so pass through Things temporal, that we finally lose not the Things eter∣nal;</HI> or as the Epistle has it, <HI>That we may pass through the Sufferings of this prefent World, to the Glory which shall be revealed.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="72"/>The EPISTLE mentions the <HI>Sufferings of the World,</HI> and tells us, <HI>That the whole Creation, nay even those who had the first Fruits of the Spirit, groan and travel in Pain together; waiting for the Manifestation of the Sons of God, and the Re∣demption of the Body.</HI></P>
<P>The GOSPEL shews us the Way of obtain∣ing what the Collect prays for: If we would have God multiply upon us his Mercy, we must be merciful as he is merciful, we must not judge nor condemn, but we must forgive, and we must be charitable: And if we would have him to be <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Coll.</NOTE> <HI>our Ruler and Guide in passing through Things temporal,</HI> we must guard against <HI>Blind-Guides,</HI> who are Leaders of <HI>the Blind;</HI> who together with those they <HI>lead, fall both into the Ditch,</HI> and <NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Coll.</NOTE> so <HI>fi∣nally lose the Things eternal.</HI></P>

<P>THE Collect is founded upon the <HI>Epistle and Gospel,</HI> and begs of God the Peace of the World, <HI>that the Church may serve him in joy and godly Quietness.</HI></P>
<P>The EPITLE shews the Method of acqui∣ring what the Collect prays for. <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="marg">Epist.</NOTE> <HI>If we be all of one Mind,</HI> as were <HI>the Partners</HI> in the Gospel; if as they did, we <NOTE N="§" PLACE="marg">Epist.</NOTE> <HI>love as Brethren,</HI> and are ready <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Gosp.</NOTE> <HI>to come and help</HI> each other; <HI>if</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="marg">Epist.</NOTE> <HI>we be pitiful and Courtous, &amp;c.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Coll.</NOTE> <HI>we shall keep the Church in godly Quiet∣ness:

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The sixth SUNDAY after <HI>Trinity.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Collect prays for the love of God, <HI>that by loving him above all Things, we may ob∣tain his Promises, which exceed all that we can desire.</HI></P>
<P>The EPISTLE tells us what these <HI>Promises</HI> are, and how we may acquire them. It assures us, <HI>we shall be planted into the Likeness of Christ's Resurection, and that we shall live with him,</HI> provided, <HI>that we walk in Newness of Life, and have destroyed the Body of Sin.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="74"/>The GOSPEL also excites us to <HI>Newness of Life,</HI> by commanding us not so much to regard what <HI>was said by them of old Time,</HI> as what our Saviour <HI>says unto us.</HI> And as the Epistle tells us, <HI>That our old Man is crucified with Christ;</HI> so the Gospel tells us, <HI>That our Righteousness must ex∣ceed the Righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees,</HI> or else <HI>we</HI> shall not enter into <HI>the Kingdom of Heaven, or obtain the Promises which exceed all that can be desired.</HI></P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The seventh SUNDAY after <HI>Trinity.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Collect having acknowledged God, from a View of the Miracle in the Gospel, <HI>to be the Lord of all Power and Might;</HI> and from our Saviour's Compassion to the hungry Multi∣tude, <HI>to be the Giver of all good Things;</HI> prays God that he would <HI>graft in our Hearts the Love of his Name, increase in us true Religion, nourish us with all Goodness, and of his great Mercy keep us in the same.</HI></P>
<P>The EPISTLE persuades us to what the Collect prays for; and advices that we should turn from being <HI>the Servants of Sin,</HI> to be the <HI>Servants of Righteousness;</HI> that we may avoid <HI>the Wages of Sin, which is Death;</HI> and obtain <HI>the Gift of God,</HI> which is <HI>eternal Life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</HI></P>
<P>The GOSPEL is the Miracle of our Savi∣our's Feeding the four Thousand with <HI>seven Loaves</HI> and a <HI>few small Fishes:</HI> Where we may observe
<PB N="70" REF="75"/>upon what Bottom the Church in this Day's Collect puts up her Petitions. By the staying of the People so long, and their eager Desire for the Doctrine of Christ, she prays <HI>for the Love of God, and the Increase of true Religion;</HI> and from the Refreshment of the <HI>Loaves,</HI> she prays, that we may <HI>be nourished with all Goodness.</HI> The Ritualists tell us, that those of the People, who came <HI>from far,</HI> are a Representation of those, <HI>who hunger and thirst after Righteousness,</HI> which they have so long fasted from, and that therefore the Epistle answers exactly in saying, <HI>When ye were the Servants of Sin, ye were freed from Righteousness.</HI></P>
<P><Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Boys,</HI> in 7th Sunday, after <HI>Trinity.</HI></NOTE> CHRIST's miraculous Feed∣ing of many People with a <HI>few Loaves,</HI> is read in the Church e∣very Year thrice; to wit, in <HI>Winter</HI> when <HI>Wheat</HI> is sown; in <HI>Lent</HI> when it is in hopeful Spring; and in Harvest, when it is ready for the Barn: The Reason hereof is manifold.</Q></P>
<P><Q>First, that in sowing, seeing, and reaping our Corn, we might not ascribe this wonder∣ful Increase to the Fatness of our Land, or Greatness of our Skill, or Goodness of our Seed; but only to the Blessing of God, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ps.</HI> clxxv. 16.</NOTE> <HI>Opening his Hand and fil∣ling all Things living with Plenti∣ousness:</HI> Who doth every Year make a great Harvest of a few Grains, as he did here make a great Feast of a few Loaves.</Q></P>

<HEAD>The eighth SUNDAY after <HI>Trinity.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Collect prays, that God <HI>would put away from us all hurtful Things, and give us such Things as are profitable to our Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>The EPISTLE shews what is <HI>hurtful and</HI> what is <HI>Profitable:</HI> That it is <HI>hurtful to live after the Flesh,</HI> and <HI>profitable, through the Spirit to mor∣tify the Deeds of the Body; because if we live af∣ter the Flesh we shall die; but if through the Spirit, we mortify the Deeds of the Body, we shall live.</HI></P>

<P>The EPISTLE shews the Necessity of our being assisted by God's Spirit, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Coll.</NOTE> <HI>to do always such Things as he rightful.</HI> The <HI>Israelites</HI> had obtained many Blessings, and tasted of the <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="marg">Coll.</NOTE> <HI>good Things of God,</HI> but when they <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Epist.</NOTE> <HI>lusted after evil Things,</HI> became Idolaters, Fornica∣tors,

<P><PB N="74" REF="81"/>
The EPISTLE is chosen from a View of the Gospel; As the Gospel mentions our Sa∣viour's weeping over the City <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and lamenting, <HI>that the Things belonging to her Peace were hidden from her Eyes;</HI> so the Epistle in∣structs us as to <HI>Spiritual Gifts,</HI> and tells us, that <HI>whoever calleth Jesus accursed</HI> or opposeth Christ and his Religion, <HI>doth not speak by the Spirit of God,</HI> and that <HI>no Man can say that Jesus is Lord,</HI> or the <HI>Messiah,</HI> but by the Holy Ghost; and that all Manner of <HI>Gifts</HI> what-ever are from the <HI>same Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>The GOSPEL is the Story of our Saviour's Weeping over the <HI>City Jerusalem.</HI> The E∣pistle is parallel to it in several Places. The Gospel tells us, <HI>that the Jews knew not the Things which belonged to their Peace; the Epistle there∣fore concerning Spiritual Gifts would not have us Ignorant</HI> as they were; the Gospel shews that our Lord, the Messiah of the World, <HI>was hid∣den from their Eyes;</HI> the Epistle shews that they wanted the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> because they were the Persons who <HI>called Jesus accursed,</HI> and who would not say that <HI>Jesus is the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>SOME of the <HI>Ritualists</HI> observe, that be our Lord's <HI>Casting them out that bought and sold in the Temple,</HI> is represented, that the Lord will throw those out of the Church, who are <HI>Buyers and Sel∣lers</HI> of Holy Orders. And therefore the Epistle very suitably tells us before, that <HI>Spiritual Gifts</HI> cannot be given, much less sold by Man; but they are the <HI>Gifts of the Holy Ghost, who di∣videth to every Man severally as he will.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="82"/>This Gospel is read at this Season because in the Month of <HI>August</HI> the <HI>Temple</HI> was burnt, and in <HI>September</HI> the whole <HI>City</HI> was set on Fire, and so was our Lord's Prediction of it fulfilled.</P>

<HEAD>The eleventh SUNDAY after <HI>Trinity.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Collect, as it were from the Mouth of the <HI>Publican</HI> in the Gospel, <HI>God be merciful to me a Sinner,</HI> and from the Apostle in the E∣pistle <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Acts</NOTE> <HI>who obtained Mercy through the</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Epist.</NOTE> <HI>Grace of God,</HI> acknowledges God <HI>to be a God of Mercy and Piety</HI> and prays that God would <HI>mercifully grant unto us his Grace,</HI> as he did the Apostle in the Epistle <HI>that we may run the Way of his Commandments, and be made Partakers of his heavenly Treasure.</HI></P>
<P>The EPISTLE gives us the Apostle St. <HI>Paul</HI> for an Example of that Humility, which is recommended in the Gospel. <HI>For,</HI> says he, <HI>I am the least of the Apostles, that am not meet to be called an Apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God.</HI> Observe how answerable this is to the <HI>Publican</HI> in the Gospel; the <HI>Publican</HI> stands afar of, and dare not so much <HI>as lift up his Eyes to Heaven.</HI> The Apostle with the same humble Mind, says, <HI>I am the least of the Apostles,</HI> &amp;c, T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>Publican</HI> confesses that he's <HI>a Sinner;</HI> the <HI>Apostle, that he persecuted the Church of God.</HI></P>
<P>The GOSPEL, in the Parable of the <HI>Pha∣risee</HI> and the <HI>Publican,</HI> shews that <HI>they which ex∣alt themselves shall be abased, and they that hum∣ble
<PB N="76" REF="83"/>themselves shall be exalted.</HI> The boasting <HI>Pha∣risee</HI> is an Instance of the Former, and the humble <HI>Publican</HI> is of the Latter. The <HI>Publican</HI> boasts not with the <HI>Pharisee, that he is not as other Men are, Extortioners, unjust,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>but he stands afar of and dare not so much as list up his Eyes to Hea∣ven;</HI> and with a deep Sense of his Guilt he <HI>smites upon his Breast,</HI> saying, <HI>God be merciful to me a Sinner.</HI> And therefore <HI>he went down to his House justified rather than the Other.</HI></P>

<P>THE Collect, considering our Saviour's Good∣ness in giving the Man in the Gospel <HI>Speech</HI> instead of <HI>Dumbness,</HI> and <HI>Hearing</HI> instead of <HI>Deafness,</HI> prays for such <HI>abundant Mercy,</HI> that we may be <HI>forgiven those Things, whereof our Conscience is afraid, and given these good Things, which we are not worthy to ask, but through the Merits and Mediation of our Saviour.</HI></P>
<P>The EPISTLE seems to have been cho∣sen as suitable to the Gospel; because the Gospel in its mystical Meaning shews, that the Priests of the <HI>new Testament</HI> should bring over to Christ's Doctrine, the Unbelievers of the World: It therefore shews, that God made the Apostles and their Successors <HI>able Ministers of the new Testament,</HI> and that <HI>the Ministration of Death,</HI> or the Ministry of the Law, was infe∣riour to the <HI>Ministration of the Spirit,</HI> or the Ministry of the Gospel.

By the <HI>Deaf and Dumb</HI> is to be understood those who hear not the Commands of God, nor speak forth his Praise. And those who bring them to Christ, <HI>and beseech him to put his Hand upon them,</HI> are an Emblem of the Preachers of the Gospel, who by the Charge of the Ministry committed to them, bring such <HI>Dumb and Deaf</HI> to Christ, and to a Knowledge of their Duty.</P>

<HEAD>The thirteenth SUNDAY after <HI>Trinity.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Collect, observing that both the Epi∣stle and Gospel shew, that Salvation, is by the <HI>free Promise</HI> of God, and not by the <HI>Jewish Law,</HI> acknowledges <HI>that of God's only Gift it com∣eth, that we do unto him true and laudable Ser∣vice;</HI> and then from these Words in the Gospel, <HI>this do, and thou shalt live,</HI> it prays God, <HI>that we may so faithfully serve him in this Life, that we fail not finally to attain his heavenly Promises.</HI></P>
<P>The EPISTLE treats of the <HI>Promise God made to</HI> Abraham <HI>and his Seed,</HI> which was, <HI>in thee shall all Nations be blessed.</HI> This was Promi∣sed
<PB N="78" REF="85"/>not to many Seeds but to his only, <HI>which Seed is Christ.</HI> It therefore tells us, that the Right of Inheritance was by that <HI>free Promise,</HI> and not by the Observation of the <HI>Jewish Law.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Epist.</NOTE> <HI>For if there had been a Law given, which could have given Life, verily Righ∣teousness should have been by the Law; But the Scripture hath concluded all under Sin, that the Promise by Faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.</HI> Those then only are saved who believe in <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> and there is no Sal∣vation by the Jewish Law.</P>
<P>The GOSPEL shews us this <HI>Seed,</HI> viz. <HI>Christ,</HI> in whom all the <HI>Nations of the World are blessed,</HI> verifying the <HI>Promise,</HI> and saying, <HI>blessed are the Eyes which see the Things that ye see, &amp;c.</HI> and by the following Parable most beautifully Points out to us, that <HI>Salvation</HI> and the <HI>Blessing promised,</HI> is not by the <HI>Jewish Law,</HI> but by <HI>Jesus Christ the promised Seed.</HI> By <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Theophy. in Loc.

<P>The EPISTLE is answerable to the Gos∣pel. For as the Gospel gives us the History of <HI>the ten Lepers,</HI> whose Disease is an Emblem of Sin, the Leprosie of the Soul; so the Epistle mentions the Substance, of which the Leprosie of the Ten was but the Shadow. <HI>For the Works of the Flesh,</HI> says it, <HI>are Adultery, Fornication, Uncleannses, Lasciviousness,</HI> &amp;c. And as the Gos∣pel tells us how the Leprosie of the Body was healed, so the Epistle tells us, how we may cure the Leprosie of the Soul: <HI>I say then walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the Lusts of the Flesh,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The GOSPEL is the History of the <HI>Ten Lepers.</HI> As our Lord was going to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> they met him, and prayed him to cure them of their Leprosie: Upon which he told them, <HI>to go shew themselves unto the Priests; and it came to pass, that as they were going, they were cleansed.</HI> For <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Levit. <HI>iv. 2.</HI></NOTE> it was com∣manded, that whoever was cured of the Leprosie, should go shew himself to the
<PB N="80" REF="87"/>Priest, that he might make the Offering which the Law required, and so be pronounced clean of the Leprosie.</P>
<P>NOW under this is couched, that when we are tainted with the Leprosie of Sin, we should go to those who are the Judges of the Uncleanness of the Soul, the Successors of those who judged of the Leprosie of the Body. <Q><NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg"><HI>Bp▪</HI> Hall.</NOTE> Whether an Act be sin∣full, or in what Degree it is such; What Grounds are sufficient for the comfortable As∣surance of Repentance, of Forgiveness; What Courses are fittest to avoid the Danger of Re∣lapses Who is so like to know, so meet to judge, as our Teachers, who are the Cleansers of the spiritual Leprosie, under their Master Christ?</Q> For they take away Sins, by the Power and Authority he endowed them with; not that they do that of themselves, but through their Lord and Master, who cleansed the Lepers as <HI>they went on their Way to the Priests,</HI> and who really <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="marg">1 <HI>John</HI> i. 1.</NOTE> <HI>clean∣seth us from all Sin:</HI> Agreeable to that in the E∣pistle, that they <HI>who are Christ's, or who walk in his Spirit, have crucified the Flesh, with the Affe∣ctions and Lusts.</HI></P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The fifteenth SUNDAY after <HI>Trinity.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Collect, as it were from a View of the <HI>False-Brethren</HI> in the Epistle, prays for the Preservation of the Church; and considering their <HI>Failing,</HI> it acknowledges the <HI>Frailty of Man</HI> without God's Assistance: And then from a
<PB N="81" REF="88"/>deep Sense of the great Danger of too much desiring those <NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Gosp.</NOTE> <HI>Things which the</HI> Gentiles <HI>seek after,</HI> and the great Ne∣cessity <HI>of</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Gosp.</NOTE> <HI>seeking first the Kingdom of God and his Righteousness,</HI> it prays God, <HI>to keep us from all Things hurtful, and lead us to all Things profitable to our Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>The EPISTLE, by giving us an Account of the Behaviour of those mentioned in it, shews plainly, <HI>what is hurtful, and what is profitable to our Salvation.</HI> It tells of some <HI>who desired to make a fair Shew in the Flesh, by constraining others to be circumcised.</HI> And this <HI>they did, that they might not suffer Persecution for the Sake</HI> of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The Em∣perors <HI>Caius, Octavian</HI> and <HI>Tiberius,</HI> had given Li∣berty to the <HI>Jews,</HI> to live according to their own Law, with∣out Mole∣station, or Disturbance through-out all the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire; So that if a <HI>Jew</HI> turned Chri∣stian, he had the Privile∣ges of a <HI>Jew,</HI> so long as he kept the ceremonial Rites of <HI>Moses;</HI> Whereas they who taught that Ceremonies were abrogated, and that Men were justified only by Faith in Christ, wanted those Pri∣ledges, and were persecuted by the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles.

So then being so anxious after the Things of this Life, as to neglect or slight the Things of the other, are <HI>the hurtful Things</HI> here <HI>spoken of;</HI> and no doubt, if we become new-Crea∣tures, as the Epistle advises, we shall possess <HI>those Things which are profita∣ble to our Salvation.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="89"/>The GOSPEL shew, <HI>that no Man can serve two Masters,</HI> which speakes the Impossibility of those mentioned in the Epistle, pleasing both the Christian and the Jew, God and the World. It was their Practice to preach to the Jews the Do∣ctrine of the Circumcision, that they might avoid Persecution, and enjoy in Ease the Things of the World; and the Doctrine of the Cross to the Christians, imagining that that was Suffi∣cient to save them; But this Gospel thews the Weakness and Folly of such Pretences. For it assures us, <HI>we cannot serve God and Mammon.</HI> Would we therefore avoid being the <HI>Servants of Sin? We must take no Thought what we shall eat or what we shall drink, or wherewith all we shall be cloathed;</HI> lest with the too anxious People in the Epistle, we become <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Gosp.</NOTE> <HI>Haters</HI> of God; but if we would be <NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Gosp.</NOTE> Lovers of God, as St <HI>Paul</HI> strives to make his <HI>Gala∣tions,</HI> we must <HI>seek first of all the Kingdom of God and his Righteousness,</HI> or first of all put on the New-Man, and become a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Epist.</NOTE> <HI>New-Creature.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The sixteenth SUNDAY after <HI>Trinity.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Collect, from the Example of St. <HI>Paul</HI> in the Epistle, praying for the Church of the <HI>Ephesians;</HI> and from our Saviour's Pity to the Widow, or the <HI>Church</HI> in the Gospel prays God <HI>that he would cleanse and defend his Church, and preserve it evermore by his Help and Goodness.</HI></P>
<P>The EPISTLE is an Instance of St. <HI>Paul,</HI>
<PB N="83" REF="90"/>praying for the Church of the <HI>Ephesians, that they might be strengthned with Might by his Spirit in the Inner-Man, that Christ might dwell in their Hearts by Faith, and that they might be filled with all the Fullness of God.</HI> Thus the Apostle in Effect prays in the Epistle that the Church may obtain, what our Lord did for her in the Gospel. And as the Epistle acknowledges <HI>that God is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we can ask or think,</HI> so the Gospel gives us an In∣stance of this Power and Goodness in our Lord's raising up the Widow's Son, when she neither ask'd, nor thought he would be raised.</P>
<P>The GOSPEL gives us an Instance of our Lord's <HI>Cleansing, Defending, and Helping his Church,</HI> in the Story of his raising the <HI>Widow's Son</HI> to Life again, as they were carrying him on the Bier to the Grave. The Widow weeping for her Son, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Bed. in Dom. <HI>16</HI> post.

<HEAD>The seventeenth SUNDAY after <HI>Trinity.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Collect prays that God's Grace may always prevent and follow us, and that he would make us, after the Example of our Lord curing the dropsical Person on the <HI>Sabbath Day,</HI> to be continually <HI>given to all good Works.</HI></P>
<P>The EPISTLE makes mention of some of those good Works the Collect prays for, and thereby Answers to the <HI>Parable</HI> of those who were bid∣den to the Marriage, and exhorts us to Humi∣lity and Meekness; telling us as it were, that when we are bidden to the Wedding, we should behave with <HI>all Lowliness and Meekness, with long-suffering, forbearing one another in Love,</HI> not aiming at a <HI>Seat in the highest Room,</HI> as did the People in the Gospel, <HI>but endeavouring to keep the Unity of the Spirit, in the bond of Peace.</HI></P>
<P>The GOSPEL in the Parable shews the Disesteem and Discredit that attend Pride and Haughtiness, and the Advantage and Profit of Humility and Meekness. <HI>For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased, and he that humbleth him∣self shall be exalted.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The eighteenth SUNDAY after <HI>Trinity.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Office of this Day relates to the Cler∣gy, and has been chosen very suitably by the Church. For as this Sunday often happens to be the Sunday of Ordination, after the <HI>Em∣ber-East</HI> in <HI>September,</HI> so nothing could be more suitable to the Season than the present Office.</P>
<P>THE Collect prays for God's <HI>Grace to with∣stand the World, the Flesh, and the Devil;</HI> and forasmuch as the Gospel tells us, <HI>That we must Love the Lord our God with all our Heart, and all our Mind,</HI> it therefore prays God, <HI>That with pure Hearts and Minds we may follow him the only God.</HI></P>
<P>The EPISTLE tells us, what Qualificati∣ons are more especially required in those to be admitted to holy Orders; <HI>that they should have Utterance, and Knowledge, and come behind in no Gift.</HI></P>
<P>The GOSPEL tells us, how our Saviour answered the Question of the Lawyer, and how he put the <HI>Pharisees</HI> to silence, so that none of them was able to answer him a Word. Which teaches us how the Ministers of Christ should be qualified; that <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Pet.</HI> iii▪ 15.</NOTE> <HI>they should be able to give an answer to e∣very one that asks them a Reason of the Hope that is in them;</HI> and to confute the <HI>Gain-sayers.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The nineteeth SUNDAY after <HI>Trinity.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Collect, considering the Epistle and Gospel, prays that the <HI>holy Spirit of God,</HI> (whereby, as the Epistle tell us, <HI>We are sealed to the Day of Redemption,</HI>) <HI>may in all Things direct and rule our Hearts;</HI> that we may avoid <HI>that Blindness of Heart</HI> mentioned in the Epistle, and not <HI>think Evil in our Hearts,</HI> as did the <HI>Scribes</HI> in the Gospel.</P>
<P>The EPISTLE is answerable to the Gos∣pel, and shews that the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> before their Conversion, were, like <HI>the Sick of the Palsie</HI> in the Gospel, <HI>lying</HI> in Sin, which the Palsie is an Emblem of. But after <HI>they had learned Christ,</HI> they laid aside <HI>the old Man, and put on the new Man, which after God is created in Righteousness and true Holiness: They were not still in their Understandings darkned, but were renewed in the Spirit of their Mind.</HI></P>
<P>The GOSPEL is the History of our Savi∣our's Curing the <HI>Sick of the Palsie,</HI> who was brought to him on a <HI>Bed;</HI> to whom also he gave Remission of Sins. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Bed. in Dom. <HI>19</HI> post Trinit.</NOTE> This is a lively Representation of a Man living dissolutely, and as the Epistle says of the <HI>Gentiles, alienated from the Life of God, and given over unto Lasciviousness, and all Uncleanness.</HI> But our blessed Lord cures him, as he did the <HI>Gentiles</HI> in the E∣pistle, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Epist.</NOTE> <HI>by putting of the old Man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful Lusts, and renewing him in the Spirit of his Mind.</HI> And when he <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="marg">Gosp.</NOTE> <HI>rises up and

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The twentieth SUNDAY after <HI>Trinity.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Collect considering the Fate of them who would not come to the <HI>Marriage,</HI> prays that <HI>we being ready both in Body and Soul,</HI> may chearfully fulfill God's Commands, and be obedient to his <HI>Will,</HI> as the Epistle advises.</P>
<P>The EPISTLE persuades, as it were, to make ready for the Wedding; <HI>that we walk cir∣cumspectly;</HI> that we be not <HI>unwise,</HI> as those were who were invited, <HI>but understanding that it is the Will of the Lord</HI> we should come to the <HI>Wed∣ding; that we should not be drunk with Wine; but be filled with the Spirit, the Wedding Gar∣ment</HI> required in the Gospel.</P>
<P>The GOSPEL is the Parable of the <HI>King,</HI> who made a Marriage for his Son. Under which is signified, that God sent his Servants to invite the Jews to the good Things he had provided for them in Heaven: But when they behaved so ungratefully to his Servants, <HI>he came and de∣stroyed those Murderers, and burnt up their City</HI> Jerusalem. Then ordered he his Servants, the Apostles, (who whilst the Jews were invited
<PB N="88" REF="95"/>and expected at the Wedding, were <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Mat. <HI>x. 5.</HI></NOTE> <HI>not to go into the Way of the Gen∣tiles,</HI>) to go into the <HI>Highways,</HI> viz. among the Gentiles, and call them to the Marriage; which they did, <HI>and so the Wedding was furnished with Guests.

<P>THE Collect, from our Lord's Compassion on the <HI>Nobleman</HI>'s Son in the Gospel, ha∣ving acknowledged the <HI>Lord</HI> to be <HI>merciful,</HI> be∣seeches God, from a View of the <HI>Nobleman</HI>'s <HI>Faith,</HI> and the Cure thereby wrought, <HI>that he would grant to his faithful People pardon, that they may be cleansed from all their Sins:</HI> And from a Consideration of the Disquietudes and Troubles of the Christian Warfare, mentioned in the E∣pistle, it prays for <HI>Peace, that we may serve God with a quiet Mind.</HI></P>
<P>The EPISTLE shews the Enemies we have to combat in our spiritual Warfare, and puts us into the Method of acquiring that <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Quiet</HI> the Collect prays for, notwithstanding we are surrounded with them in the most hostile Manner. For it advises us <HI>to be strong in the Lord, and in the Power of his Might.</HI></P>
<P>The GOSPEL is an Account of the <HI>Noble∣man,</HI>
<PB N="89" REF="96"/>who desired Jesus to go down to <HI>Caperna∣um</HI> to heal his Son who was a dying; to whom <HI>Jesus</HI> said, <HI>go thy way, thy Son liveth.</HI> By <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Theophy. in Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> this is represented to us, that when our dear and immortal Souls are assaulted with Evils and Temptations almost to death, and we come to our Lord, and beg him to relieve us, he sends us the Aid and Assi∣stance of his holy Spirit: So that <NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Psal. <HI>lx.</HI></NOTE> <HI>when God arises his Enemies are scattered, and they which hate him flee before him.</HI> Wherefore when we <HI>are surrounded with the Fi∣ery Darts</HI> of the <HI>Devil,</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="marg">Epist.</NOTE> <HI>let us be strong in the Lord, and in the Power of his Might.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Twenty-second SUNDAY after <HI>Trinity.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Collect, imitating St. <HI>Paul,</HI> praying for the Church of the <HI>Philipians</HI> in the Epistle, prays God, the <HI>King</HI> in the Gospel, who <HI>took an Account of his Servants,</HI> to <HI>keep his Household, the Church, in continual Godliness, that through his Protection it may be free from all Adversities, and devoutly given to serve him in all good Works, to the Glory of his Holy Name, through Jesus Christ our Lord, viz.</HI> such <NOTE N="§" PLACE="marg">Epist.</NOTE> <HI>good Works</HI> as the Apostle tells us in the Epistle, God <HI>had begun</HI> in the <HI>Philipians,</HI> and such as at the End of this Epistle are called <HI>the Fruits of Righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, to the Glo∣ry and Praise of God.</HI></P>
<P>The EPISTLE shews the Love and Charity of St. <HI>Paul</HI> to the Church of the <HI>Philipians, for
<PB N="90" REF="97"/>God, says he, is my Record, how greatly I long af∣ter you all, in the Bowels of Jesus Christ.</HI> And then he prays with such a Spirit of <HI>brotherly Kindness,</HI> as is required in the Gospel, <HI>that their Love may abound yet more and more; that they may be Sincere and without Offence, 'till the Day of Christ,</HI> or <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Gosp.</NOTE> or <HI>till the King come to take an Account of his Servants.</HI></P>
<P>The GOSPEL is the Parable of the <HI>unmer∣ciful Servant,</HI> which is grounded upon a Question of <HI>Peter</HI> to our Lord, <HI>How often shall my Brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven Times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee until seven Times, but until seventy Times seven: Therefore is the Kingdom of Heaven, &amp;c.</HI> in which Para∣ble is shewn the <HI>great Mercy</HI> of God, in forgiv∣ing us such infinite Numbers of Sins, and our <HI>Unmercifulness</HI> in not forgiving each other a pet∣ty Trespass; And it also shews the grievous Con∣sequence of such unbrotherly Treatment, <HI>viz.</HI> that the cruel and unmerciful will the <HI>delivered</HI> to those everlasting <HI>Tormentors,</HI> the Flames of Hell, where they can never pay the Debt of their Sins.</P>
<P>THE Collect then prays, that we may serve <HI>God in good Works;</HI> the Epistle shews what these <HI>good Works</HI> are, <HI>viz.</HI> such as <HI>God had begun</HI> in the <HI>Philipians, that their Love might abound more and more to each other, in Knowledge, and in all Judgment; that they might approve, &amp;c.</HI> And the Gospel gives us an Example of <HI>good Works</HI> in the King mentioned in it, and threatens us with eternal Misery if we do not follow it.</P>
