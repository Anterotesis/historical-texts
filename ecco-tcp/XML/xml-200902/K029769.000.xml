<P>THE CAPTIVES, A TRAGEDY; As Performed at the THEATRE-ROYAL, DRURY-LANE.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Captives</HI> are at length released from the theatre, where they have been confined for more than three months; and now they hope to find a sanctuary in the closet. It was the inten∣tion of the author, throughout his piece, to make experiment of a style and diction, different from what are usual in modern Tragedy. Over-wrought ornaments, and pompous versification, he thought, ill suited to the manners of those early times, in which the action of his Tragedy is supposed to have passed. In a word, he was of opinion, that the language of simplicity would best accord with the subject and the characters: but whether a plain, intelligible, and unaffected style, would be acceptable to the public taste, was what he had still to learn. The experiment has been made; and the author retires with the satisfaction of having, at least, intended well.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS VAUGHAN, Esq.</BYLINE>
<SP>
<STAGE>The Speaker Mr. BANNISTER, jun. in the Character of a distressed and disappointed Poet, peeping in at the door, looks round the house.</STAGE>
<L>ARE you all seated—may I venture in?</L>
<STAGE>Noise behind.</STAGE>
<L>Hush—be quiet—stop your unfriendly din—</L>
<L>Whilst I—with more than common grief oppress'd,</L>
<L>A tale unfold—just bursting from my breast.</L>
<STAGE>Advancing, points to the Pit doors.</STAGE>
<L>But first—are both your pit doors shut, I pray?</L>
<L>Or noise will drown, my strictures on the play,</L>
<STAGE>Noise from front boxes opening doors and calling places.</STAGE>
<L>Do you hear—how very hard my case is—</L>
<L>Instead of bravo, bravo—places—places— <STAGE>mimicking.</STAGE></L>
<L>Your seat, my Lord, is here—your La'ship's there,</L>
<L>Indeed it quite distracts both bard and player.</L>
<L>Truce then with your confounded clank of keys,</L>
<L>And tell these fair disturbers of our ease,</L>
<L><HI>At church,</HI> perhaps, 'tis no such mighty crime,</L>
<L>But <HI>here</HI>—quite vulgar to be out of time.</L>
<STAGE>Noise from front boxes repeated.</STAGE>
<L>Again—why sure the devil's in the clown,</L>
<L>Do pray Sir Harry knock that fellow down.— <STAGE>pointing.</STAGE></L>
<L>And you, ye Gods—it were a dreadful shock,</L>
<L>If thrown from thence—a Critic's head is rock.— <STAGE>the pit.</STAGE></L>
<L>So keep your centres, and my bus'ness know;</L>
<L>I am a bard, as these my <HI>Acts</HI> will shew.</L>
<STAGE>Pulling out plays from each coat pocket.</STAGE>
<L>But then the managers—aye! there's the curse</L>
<L>Which makes us <HI>patient bear</HI> the sad reverse,</L>
<L><PB N="vi" REF="4"/>To hear, they've several pieces to peruse,</L>
<L>And when I call, all answer they refuse?</L>
<L>But say, is't fit, that mine be laid aside,</L>
<L>To gratify their present author's pride?</L>
<L>Who comes with nature, and such idle stuff,</L>
<L>As please my friends above there well enough—</L>
<STAGE>the galleries.</STAGE>
<L>When I, more bold and daring, quit all rules,</L>
<STAGE>In the pompous burlesque of Tragedy.</STAGE>
<L>And scorn to draw from Classics and the Schools;</L>
<L>But bid the dreadful surges from a grave,</L>
<L>To sink the merchant "in the bankrupt wave."</L>
<L>Or when I long for fair Aurora's light,</L>
<L>"I am witch-ridden by the hag of night."</L>
<L>Thus always keep <HI>sublimity</HI> in eye,</L>
<L>And sometimes hand in hand—<HI>simplicity.</HI></L>
<L>New traps, new passages for ever raise,</L>
<L>With starts and attitudes to gain your praise,</L>
<L>Try every incident of trick and art,</L>
<L>To mend, at once, the drama and the heart.</L>
<L>Such is <HI>my</HI> style, and such each nervous line,</L>
<L>Which all my friends who read pronounce divine;</L>
<L>And yet these hostile doors their barriers keep,</L>
<L>And all <HI>my</HI> labours—in my pockets sleep. <STAGE>Pointing to them.</STAGE></L>
<L>Revenge my cause, assert each critic right,</L>
<L>And damn, with me, the author of to-night,</L>
<L>Whose play, tho' yet <HI>unknown, untried, unseen,</HI></L>
<L>Has felt in paragraphs an author's spleen.</L>
<L>But hark!—I'll tell you a secret—'twas I,</L>
<L>Who drew the shaft, and forg'd th' envenom'd lie,</L>
<L>To crush this simple nature which he boasts,</L>
<L>Drawn from the manners of the northern coasts;</L>
<L>For should <HI>his</HI> hope your generous plaudits meet,</L>
<L><HI>I</HI> shall be found aboard—the <HI>Lighter Fleet.</HI></L>
<STAGE>Advances forward and kneels.</STAGE>
<L>Then hear a malefactor in blank verse,</L>
<L>Nor be led <HI>captive,</HI> by his Gothick Erse,</L>
<L>But urge my vengeance, in the cat-call's curse.</L>
<STAGE>Going stops, and looks around the house.</STAGE>
<L><PB N="vii" REF="5"/>Yet, hold; methinks my words seem lost in air,</L>
<L>And smiles of candour for the bard declare;</L>
<L>For here no <HI>secret influence</HI> e'er was known,</L>
<L>But merit triumphs <HI>in herself alone</HI></L>
<L>As all who know ye, must in this agree,</L>
<L>A British audience <HI>ever</HI> will be free.</L>

<L>Nay, gentle lady, start not; there's no danger.</L>
<L>Self-preservation drew my vengeance down</L>
<L>On yon relentless ruffian; who, in scorn</L>
<L>Of hospitality's most sacred laws,</L>
<L>Assail'd a ship-wreck'd stranger. My sword's sheath'd;</L>
<L>And thou behold'st a suppliant, who intreats</L>

<L>And of whose charity he may implore</L>
<L>Mere sustenance for life.</L>

<SPEAKER>MINLA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thy desperate act</L>

<L>But hard necessity, that breaks all bounds,</L>

<L>Know then, poor stranger, that this northern part</L>

<L>Ye towers of Selma! and thou mournful flood,</L>

<L>Oft have you heard my anguish; heard me weep,</L>
<L>To the pale midnight moon, th' intestine broils,</L>
<L>That from my country drove me on the seas;</L>
<L>Where with brute rage, this royal plunderer</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="11"/>Boarded, and sunk my bark: but not the loss</L>
<L>Of country; not captivity itself;</L>
<L>With its worst horrors, Connal's hateful passion,</L>

<L>Generous Everallin?</L>
<L>Oh, how unlike that king? next thee, my Minla,</L>

<L>Has quieted this conflict.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MINLA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Now no words</L>
<L>He sends of consolation to Malvina.</L>
<L>Dark doubts instead, and dismal apprehensions.</L>
<L>Now he forewarns thee to beware the worst;</L>
<L>For he suspects the worst. A sudden call</L>

<L>Grief loves to dwell upon the gloomier side,</L>

<BYLINE>By THOMAS VAUGHAN, Esq.</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Spoken by Mrs. SIDDONS.</BYLINE>
<SP>
<L>AT length our bark has reached the wished-for shore,</L>
<L>The winds are hush'd—but is all danger o'er?</L>
<L>The trembling bard still hovers o'er the main—</L>
<L>Still dreads the dancing waves that lash in vain;</L>
<L>Clings like th'affrighted sailor to the mast,</L>
<L>And shudders at the dangers he has past.</L>
<L>Dangers indeed—for who, in times like these,</L>
<L>Would launch his ship to plough dramatic seas?</L>
<L>Where growling thunders roll, and tempests sweep</L>
<L>Such crouds of bold adventurers to the deep.</L>
<L>O'er his poor head the winds of malice blow,</L>
<L>And waves of angry censure rage below.</L>
<L>Critics, like monsters, on each side appear,</L>
<L><HI>Herald,</HI> the whale; and shark, the <HI>Gazetteer</HI>—</L>
<L>If these he chance t' escape, there comes a squall</L>
<L>From <HI>Lloyd's, St. James's, London,</HI> or <HI>Whitehall;</HI></L>
<L>Here <HI>Chronicle,</HI> like Scylla, guards the coast,</L>
<L>There foams Charybdis—in the <HI>Morning Post.</HI></L>
<L>Mark how they break his rudder, cut his cable,</L>
<L>Tear up plan, diction, sentiment, and fable;</L>
<L>Their order is—an order they enjoy,</L>
<L>To seize, to burn, to sink, and to destroy.</L>
<L>What wonderous chance our author should survive,</L>
<L>That in such boisterous seas his bark's alive?</L>
<L><PB N="88" REF="85" MS="y"/>But fond Ambition led the bard along,</L>
<L>And Syren Muses tempted with a song;</L>
<L>Fame, like another Circe, beck'ning stood,</L>
<L>Waved her fair hand, and bade him brave the flood.</L>
<L>Who could resist, when thus she shewed her charms,</L>
<L>Soothed his fond hopes, and wooed him to her arms?</L>
<L>Half-rigg'd, half mann'd, and leaky, as you find,</L>
<L>He tricked his frigate out, and brav'd the wind.</L>
<L>Your partial favour still may swell his sails,</L>
<L>And fill his vessel with propitious gales;</L>
<L>Though peppered with small shot, and tempest tossed,</L>
<L>You still may land him on this golden coast;</L>
<L>Convinced that those the surest path pursue,</L>
<L>Who trust their <HI>all</HI> to candour and to you.</L>
