<HEAD>AN IMPOSSIBLE THING. A <HI>TALE.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>O thee, Dear <HI>Dick,</HI> this Tale I send,</L>
<L>Both as a Critick and a Friend.</L>
<L>I tell it with some Variation</L>
<L>(Not altogether a Translation)</L>
<L>From <HI>La Fontaine;</HI> an Author, <HI>Dick,</HI></L>
<L>Whose Muse would touch thee to the quick.</L>
<L>The Subject is of that same kind</L>
<L>To which thy Heart seems most inclin'd:</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="4"/>
How Verse may alter it, God knows,</L>
<L>Thou lov'st it well, I'm sure, in Prose,</L>
<L>So, without Preface, or Pretence,</L>
<L>To hold thee longer in Suspence,</L>
<L>I shall proceed, as I am able,</L>
<L>To the Recital of my Fable.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A <HI>Goblin</HI> of the merry Kind,</L>
<L>More black of Hue, than curst of Mind,</L>
<L>To help a Lover in Distress,</L>
<L>Contriv'd a Charm with such Success;</L>
<L>That in short Space the cruel Dame</L>
<L>Relented, and return'd his Flame.</L>
<L>The Dargain made betwixt 'em both,</L>
<L>Was bound by Honour and by Oath:</L>
<L>The Lover laid down his Salvation,</L>
<L>And <HI>Satan</HI> stak'd his Reputation.</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="5"/>
The Latter promis'd on his Part</L>
<L>(To serve his Friend and shew his Art,)</L>
<L>That Madam shou'd by twelve a Clock,</L>
<L>Tho' hitherto as hard as Rock,</L>
<L>Become as gentle as a Glove,</L>
<L>And kiss and coo like any Dove.</L>
<L>In short, the Woman should be his,</L>
<L>That is, upon Condition—<HI>Viz;</HI></L>
<L>That He, the Lover, after tasting</L>
<L>What one wou'd wish were everlasting;</L>
<L>Should, in Return for such Enjoyment,</L>
<L>Supply the Fiend with fresh Employment:</L>
<L>That's all, quoth <HI>Pug;</HI> my poor Request</L>
<L>Is, only never to have Rest;</L>
<L>You thought, 'tis like, with Reason too,</L>
<L>That I should have been serv'd, not You:</L>
<L>But what? upon my Friend impose!</L>
<L>No—tho' a Devil, none of those.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="6"/>
Your Business then, pray understand me,</L>
<L>Is nothing more but to Command me.</L>
<L>Of one thing only let me warn ye,</L>
<L>Which somewhat nearly may concern ye:</L>
<L>As soon as e'er one Work is done,</L>
<L>Strait name a new one; and so on;</L>
<L>Let each to other quick succeed,</L>
<L>Or else—you know how 'tis agreed—</L>
<L>For if thro' any Hums or Haws</L>
<L>There haps an intervening Pause,</L>
<L>In which, for Want of fresh Commands,</L>
<L>Your Slave obsequious, Idle stands,</L>
<L>Nor Soul nor Body ever more</L>
<L>Shall serve the Nymph whom you adore;</L>
<L>But both be laid at <HI>Satan</HI>'s Feet,</L>
<L>To be dispos'd as he thinks meet.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At once the Lover all approves:</L>
<L>For who can hesitate that loves?</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="7"/>
And thus he argues in his Thought:</L>
<L>Why, after all, I venture nought;</L>
<L>What Mystery is in Commanding?</L>
<L>Does that require Much Understanding?</L>
<L>Indeed, wer't my Part to Obey,</L>
<L>He'd go the better of the Lay:</L>
<L>But he must do what I think fit—</L>
<L>Pshaw, pshaw, young <HI>Belzebub</HI> is bit.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus pleas'd in Mind, he calls a Chair;</L>
<L>Adjusts, and combs, and courts the Fair:</L>
<L>The Spell takes Place, and all goes right,</L>
<L>And happy he, employs the Night</L>
<L>In sweet Embraces, balmy Kisses;</L>
<L>And riots in the Bliss of Blisses.</L>
<L>O Joy, cry'd he, that hast no Equal!</L>
<L>But hold—no Raptures—mark the Sequel.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="8"/>
For now, when near the Morning's Dawn,</L>
<L>The Youth began as 'twere to yawn;</L>
<L>His Eyes a silky Slumber seiz'd,</L>
<L>Or would have done, if <HI>Pug</HI> had pleas'd:</L>
<L>But that officious <HI>Demon,</HI> near,</L>
<L>Now buzz'd for Business in his <HI>Ear;</HI></L>
<L>In Haste, he names a thousand Things:</L>
<L>The <HI>Goblin</HI> plys his wicker Wings,</L>
<L>And in a Trice returns to ask</L>
<L>Another and another Task.</L>
<L>Now, Palaces are built and Tow'rs,</L>
<L>The Work of Ages in few Hours.</L>
<L>Then, Storms are in an Instant rais'd,</L>
<L>Which the next Moment are appeas'd.</L>
<L>Now Show'rs of Gold and Gems are rain'd,</L>
<L>As if each <HI>India</HI> had been drain'd:</L>
<L>And He, in one astonish'd View,</L>
<L>Sees both <HI>Golconda</HI> and <HI>Peru.</HI></L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="9"/>
These Things, and stranger Things than these,</L>
<L>Were done with equal Speed and Ease.</L>
<L>And now to <HI>Rome</HI> poor <HI>Pug</HI> he'll send:</L>
<L>And <HI>Pug</HI> soon reach'd his Journey's End.</L>
<L>And soon return'd with such a Pack</L>
<L>Of Bulls and Pardons at his Back,</L>
<L>That now, the Squire (who had some Hope</L>
<L>In holy Water and the Pope,)</L>
<L>Was out of Heart, and at a Stand</L>
<L>What next to wish, and what command;</L>
<L>Invention flags, his Brain grows muddy,</L>
<L>And black Despair succeeds brown Study.</L>
<L>In this Distress the woful Youth</L>
<L>Acquaints the Nymph with all the Truth,</L>
<L>Begging her Counsel, for whose Sake</L>
<L>Both Soul and Body were at Stake.</L>
<L>And is this all? replys the Fair;</L>
<L>Let me alone to cure this Care.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="10"/>
When next your <HI>Demon</HI> shall appear,</L>
<L>Pray give him—look, what I hold here.</L>
<L>And bid him labour, soon or late,</L>
<L>To lay these Ringlets lank and strait.</L>
<L>Then, something scarcely to be seen,</L>
<L>Her Finger and her Thumb between</L>
<L>She held, and sweetly smiling, cry'd,</L>
<L>Your <HI>Goblin</HI>'s Skill shall now be try'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She said; and gave—what shall I call</L>
<L>That Thing so shining, crisp and small,</L>
<L>Which round his Finger strove to twine?</L>
<L>A Tendril of the <HI>Cyprian</HI> Vine?</L>
<L>Or Sprig from <HI>Cytherea</HI>'s Grove;</L>
<L>Shade of the Labyrinth of Love!</L>
<L>With Awe, he now takes from her Hand</L>
<L>That Fleece-like Flow'r of fairy Land:</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="11"/>
Less precious, whilom, was the Fleece</L>
<L>Which drew the <HI>Argonauts</HI> from <HI>Greece;</HI></L>
<L>Or that, which modern Ages see</L>
<L>The Spur and Prize of Chivalry,</L>
<L>Whose Curls of kindred Texture, grace</L>
<L>Heroes and Kings of <HI>Spanish</HI> Race.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Spark prepar'd, and <HI>Pug</HI> at Hand,</L>
<L>He issues, thus, his strict Command.</L>
<L>This Line, thus Curve and thus Orbicular,</L>
<L>Render direct, and perpendicular;</L>
<L>But so direct, that in no sort</L>
<L>It ever may in Rings retort.</L>
<L>See me no more 'till this be done:</L>
<L>Hence, to thy Task—avaunt, be gone.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Away the Fiend like Lightning flys,</L>
<L>And all his Wit to Work applys:</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="12"/>
Anvils and Presses he employs,</L>
<L>And dins whole Hell with hamm'ring Noise.</L>
<L>In vain: he to no Terms can bring</L>
<L>One Twire of that reluctant Thing;</L>
<L>Th' elastic Fibre mocks his Pains,</L>
<L>And it's first spiral Form retains.</L>
<L>New Stratagems the Sprite co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ves,</L>
<L>And down the Depths of Sea he dives:</L>
<L>This Sprunt its Pertness sure will lose</L>
<L>When laid (said he) to soak in Ooze.</L>
<L>Poor foolish Fiend! he little knew</L>
<L>Whence <HI>Venus</HI> and her Garden grew.</L>
<L>Old Ocean, with paternal Waves</L>
<L>The Child of his own Bed receives;</L>
<L>Which oft as dipt new Force exerts,</L>
<L>And in more vig'rous Curls reverts.</L>
<L>So, when to Earth, <HI>Alcides</HI> flung</L>
<L>The huge <HI>Antëus,</HI> whence he sprung,</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="13"/>
From ev'ry Fall fresh Strength he gain'd,</L>
<L>And with new Life the Fight maintain'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The bafled <HI>Goslin</HI> grows perplex'd,</L>
<L>Nor knows what Sleight to practise next:</L>
<L>The more he trys, the more he fails;</L>
<L>Nor Charm, nor Art, nor Force avails.</L>
<L>But all concur his Shame to show,</L>
<L>And more exasperate the Foe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now he pensive turns and sad,</L>
<L>And looks like melancholick mad.</L>
<L>He rolls his Eyes now off, now on</L>
<L>That wonderful <HI>Phenomenon.</HI></L>
<L>Sometimes he twists and twirls it round,</L>
<L>Then, pausing, meditates profound:</L>
<L>No End he sees of his Surprize,</L>
<L>Nor what it should be can devise:</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="14"/>
For never yet was Wooll or Feather,</L>
<L>That cou'd stand buff against all Weather;</L>
<L>And unrelax'd like this, resist</L>
<L>Both Wind and Rain, and Snow and Mist.</L>
<L>What Stuff, or whence, or how 'twas made,</L>
<L>What Spinster Witch could spin such Thread,</L>
<L>He nothing knew; but to his Cost</L>
<L>Knew all his Fame and Labour lost.</L>
<L>Subdu'd, abash'd, he gave it o'er;</L>
<L>'Tis said, he blush'd; 'tis sure, he swore</L>
<L>Not all the Wiles that Hell could hatch</L>
<L>Could conquer that SUPERB MUSTACH.</L>
<L>Defeated thus, thus discontent,</L>
<L>Back to the Man the <HI>Demon</HI> went:</L>
<L>I grant, quoth he, our Contract null,</L>
<L>And give you a Discharge in full.</L>
<L>But tell me now, in Name of Wonder,</L>
<L>(Since I so candidly knock under,)</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="15"/>
What is this Thing? Where could it grow?</L>
<L>Pray take it—'tis in <HI>Statu quo.</HI></L>
<L>Much Good may't do you; for my Part,</L>
<L>I wash my Hands of't from my Heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In Truth, Sir <HI>Goblin</HI> or Sir <HI>Fairy,</HI></L>
<L>Replys the Lad, you're too soon weary.</L>
<L>What, leave this trifling Task undone!</L>
<L>And think'st Thou this the only one?</L>
<L>Alas! were this subdu'd, thou'dst find</L>
<L>Millions of more such still behind,</L>
<L>Which might employ, ev'n to Eternity,</L>
<L>Both you and all your whole Fraternity.</L>

<HEAD>THE PEASANT in Search of his HEIFER. A <HI>TALE,</HI> After M. <HI>De la Fontaine.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T so befell: a silly Swain</L>
<L>Had sought his Heifer long in vain;</L>
<L>For wanton she had frisking stray'd,</L>
<L>And left the Lawn, to seek the Shade.</L>
<L>Around the Plain he rolls his Eyes,</L>
<L>Then, to the Wood, in Haste he hies;</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="17"/>
Where, singling out the fairest Tree,</L>
<L>He climbs, in Hopes to hear or see.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Anon, there chanc'd that Way to pass</L>
<L>A jolly Lad and buxom Lass:</L>
<L>The Place was apt, the Pastime pleasant;</L>
<L>Occasion with her Forelock present:</L>
<L>The Girl agog, the Gallant ready;</L>
<L>So lightly down he lays my Lady.</L>
<L>But so she turn'd, or so was said,</L>
<L>That she some certain Charms display'd,</L>
<L>Which with such Wonder struck his Sight,</L>
<L>(With Wonder, much; more, with Delight)</L>
<L>That loud he cry'd in Rapture, What!</L>
<L>What see I, Gods! What see I not!</L>
<L>But nothing nam'd; from whence 'tis guess'd,</L>
<L>'Twas more than well could be express'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
<L>The Clown aloft, who lent an Ear,</L>
<L>Strait stopt him short in mid Career:</L>
<L>And louder cry'd, Ho! honest Friend,</L>
<L>That of thy seeing seest no End;</L>
<L>Dost see the Heifer that I seek?</L>
<L>If do'st, pray be so kind to speak.</L>
