<L>TH' unloosen'd anchors to the waves resign</L>
<L>The Delphian keels, while Auster's friendly breath,</L>
<L>Their burden light'ning, soon to Sunium shews</L>
<L>The spreading sails. Two vessels, riding there,</L>
<L N="5">Receive embarking warriors. On the beach</L>
<L>Looks Medon stedfast: By almighty Jove,</L>
<L>He cries aloud, Themistocles I see!</L>
<L>O Haliartus, O my holy friend,</L>
<L>We must not leave unvisited a shore</L>
<L N="10"><PB N="2" REF="4"/>
Which holds that living trophy to our view,</L>
<L>The victor-chief at Salamis. The skiff</L>
<L>Is launch'd; they land. Themistocles begins</L>
<L>The salutation: Hail! Oileus' son,</L>
<L>Thou rev'rend host of Athens, Timon, hail!</L>
<L N="15">Your unexpected presence here excites</L>
<L>A pleasing wonder. Whither do ye steer</L>
<L>These well remember'd vessels, which convey'd</L>
<L>Thee, first of Locrians, with our Attic bard,</L>
<L>To Salamis from Delphi? In that course</L>
<L N="20">Was Timon captive made, whom freed at last</L>
<L>My joyful arms embrace. The Locrian here:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To Atalanté, in Euboean streights,</L>
<L>We steer; another of Oilean race,</L>
<L>Through bounteous Heav'n a refuge there obtains,</L>
<L N="25">My brother, good Leonteus, with a band</L>
<L>Of gallant Locrians, ready at my call</L>
<L>To lift their bucklers in defence of Greece.</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="5"/>
But why, remote from Athens, on the strand</L>
<L>Of naked Sunium, do I see the son</L>
<L N="30">Of Neocles, so recently by me</L>
<L>At Sparta left? Themistocles replies:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Forbear enquiry now, O virtuous branch</L>
<L>Of that ennobled stock, th' Oilean house!</L>
<L>If e'er my conduct merited thy praise,</L>
<L N="35">If thou believ'st me studious of the fame</L>
<L>Which follows manly deeds, forbear to doubt</L>
<L>Th' unwearied further efforts of my limbs,</L>
<L>My heart, my talents: Secrecy matures,</L>
<L>Time brings the labour of the mind to birth.</L>
<L>Were those first steps reveal'd, which restless thought,</L>
<L N="41">Constructing some vast enterprize, ascends,</L>
<L>How wild a wand'rer, Medon, would appear</L>
<L>The policy of man! But, gen'rous chief,</L>
<L>Whose valour, whose experience might assure</L>
<L N="45">A prosp'rous issue to a bold exploit,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="6"/>
Say, should I open on some future day</L>
<L>To thy discerning sight the clearest track,</L>
<L>Where to success one glorious stride might reach,</L>
<L>Wouldst thou be ready at my call? He paus'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="50">From such a mouth, such captivating words</L>
<L>Insinuate sweetness through the Locrian's ear,</L>
<L>Who feels th' allurement; yet, by prudence rul'd,</L>
<L>This answer frames: Through such a glorious track</L>
<L>Whoever guides, may challenge Medon's aid;</L>
<L>Thou prove that guide, my steps shall follow close,</L>
<L N="56">Unless by Aristides call'd, whose voice</L>
<L>Commands my service. Cool th' Athenian hides</L>
<L>The smart his wounded vanity endures,</L>
<L>And manly thus, unchang'd in look, rejoins:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="60">I ask no more; I rest my future claim</L>
<L>On Medon's valour, only to support</L>
<L>What Aristides shall approve, farewell.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="7"/>
Avail thee straight of these propitious winds;</L>
<L>In Atalanté, known to me of old,</L>
<L>What force thou can'st, assemble; dread no wants,</L>
<L N="65">I will be watchful to supply them all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>They part. Now Medon, under hoisted sails,</L>
<L>Remarks unwonted transport on the cheek</L>
<L>Of Haliartus. O my peasant weeds,</L>
<L>His joy exclaims, how gratefully you rise</L>
<L N="70">In my remembrance now! From you my hopes</L>
<L>Forebode some benefit to Greece. Dear lord,</L>
<L>Forbear enquiry; by yon hero warn'd,</L>
<L>In secrecy my thoughts, till form'd complete,</L>
<L>Lie deeply bury'd. Timon smil'd, and spake:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="75">I know, full often enterprises bold</L>
<L>Lie in the womb of mystery conceal'd;</L>
<L>Thus far th' Athenian hero and thyself</L>
<L>Raise expectation; but I further know,</L>
<L N="80"><PB N="6" REF="8"/>
His faculties are matchless, thou art brave,</L>
<L>Unerring Medon like my god is wise;</L>
<L>Thence expectation soars on steady wings.</L>
<L>O light of Greece, Themistocles, exert</L>
<L>Thy boundless pow'rs! mature thy pregnant plan!</L>
<L N="85">Whene'er the glorious mystery unveils,</L>
<L>Me and my Delphians thou shalt find prepar'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The turbulent Euripus swift they plough</L>
<L>In pleasing converse thus, and clasp, in hope,</L>
<L>Their anxious friends on Atalanté's shore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="90">When ev'ry mast was hid by Sunium's cape,</L>
<L>Thus to his faithful minister, the son</L>
<L>Of Neocles: Sicinus, hast thou seen</L>
<L>My followers on board? The treasures brought</L>
<L>From Xerxes, those my spoils of war supply,</L>
<L N="95">The arms, the stores, Sicinus, has thy care</L>
<L>Deposited in safety? Yes, replies</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="9"/>
Th' entrusted servant. Now thyself embark,</L>
<L>His lord enjoins, who, musing thus, remains:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If my attempt to further I have won</L>
<L N="100">This gallant Locrian, frankly I confess</L>
<L>My debt to fortune; but this casual boon</L>
<L>I can forego, if wantonly her hand</L>
<L>Resumes; Themistocles alone can trace</L>
<L>A path to glory. Tow'rds the land he turns,</L>
<L N="105">Proceeding thus: Now, Attica, farewell,</L>
<L>A while farewell. To thee, Barbarian gold,</L>
<L>Themistocles resorts; my bosom guest,</L>
<L>Whom Aristides in disdain would spurn,</L>
<L>By thee, O gift of Xerxes, I will raise</L>
<L N="110">The weal of Athens, and a fresh increase</L>
<L>To my own laurels. Uncontroll'd, supreme</L>
<L>Is Aristides. He the Attic youth</L>
<L>In phalanx bright to victory may lead;</L>
<L>Minerva's bird Xanthippus may display</L>
<L N="115"><PB N="8" REF="10"/>
To Asia, trembling at their naval flag;</L>
<L>A private man, Themistocles will reach</L>
<L>Your summits, fellow citizens, preferr'd</L>
<L>To his command. Ye chosen heroes, wait</L>
<L>For breezy spring to wanton in your sails,</L>
<L>Then range your vig'rous files, and pamper'd steeds;</L>
<L N="121">Themistocles, amid septentrion snows,</L>
<L>Shall rouse despair and anguish from their den</L>
<L>Of lamentation; poverty shall blaze</L>
<L>In radiant steel; pale misery shall grasp</L>
<L N="125">A standard. Athens, thy rejected son</L>
<L>Extorted aid from tyranny shall draw</L>
<L>On his own greatness to establish thine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Swift he embarks, like Neptune when he mounts</L>
<L N="130">His rapid conch to call the tempests forth,</L>
<L>Upturn the floods, and rule them when they rage.</L>
<L>The third clear morning shews Eretria's port,</L>
<L>Among Euboean cities once superb,</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="11"/>
Eretria now in ashes. She had join'd</L>
<L>Th' Athenians, bold invaders, who consum'd</L>
<L N="135">The capital of Lydia, to revenge</L>
<L>Ionian Greeks enthrall'd. Eretria paid</L>
<L>Severe atonement to Hystaspes' son,</L>
<L>Incens'd Darius. To a Cissian plain,</L>
<L>A central space of his unbounded realm,</L>
<L>Far from their ancient seat, which flames devour'd,</L>
<L N="141">He her exterminated race confin'd,</L>
<L>Sad captives, never to revisit more</L>
<L>Their native isle. A silent wharf admits</L>
<L>Themistocles on shore, a void extent,</L>
<L>Where sons of Neptune heretofore had swarm'd.</L>
<L N="146">No mooring vessel in the haven rode,</L>
<L>No footstep mark'd the ways; sole inmates there,</L>
<L>Calamity and horror, as enthron'd,</L>
<L>Sat on o'erwhelming ruins, and forbade</L>
<L N="150">The hero passage, till a seeming track</L>
<L>Presents, half bury'd in surrounding heaps</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="12"/>
Of desolation, what appears a dome,</L>
<L>Rais'd to some god. Themistocles observes</L>
<L>A shatter'd porch, whose proud supporters lie</L>
<L N="155">In fragments, save one column, which upholds</L>
<L>Part of a sculptur'd pediment, where, black</L>
<L>By conflagation, an inscription maim'd</L>
<L>Retains these words, "To eleutherian Jove."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Th' Athenian enters, follow'd by his train</L>
<L N="160">In arms complete. Excluded was the day</L>
<L>By ruins pil'd externally around,</L>
<L>Unless what broken thinly-scatter'd rays</L>
<L>Shot through th' encumber'd portal. Soon they stand</L>
<L>Amidst obscuring dusk in silence all,</L>
<L N="165">All motionless in wonder, while a voice,</L>
<L>Distinct in tone, delivers through the void</L>
<L>These solemn accents: Eleutherian god!</L>
<L>Since no redeemer to Eretria fall'n</L>
<L>Thy will vouchsafes, why longer dost thou keep</L>
<L N="170"><PB N="11" REF="13"/>
Thy aged servant on a stage of woe?</L>
<L>Why not release him? why not close his eyes,</L>
<L>So vainly melting o'er his country lost?</L>
<L>Ten years are fled; the morning I have hail'd</L>
<L>In sighs alone; have laid my head on thorns</L>
<L N="175">Of anguish, nightly visited in dreams</L>
<L>By images of horror, which employ</L>
<L>Each waking moment. To have seen destroy'd</L>
<L>From their foundations my paternal streets,</L>
<L>The holy structures burn, a people forc'd</L>
<L N="180">In climates new and barbarous to dwell,</L>
<L>Was sure enough to suffer—It is time</L>
<L>To give my patience rest. The plaintive sound</L>
<L>Draws on th' Athenian, who perceives a gleam,</L>
<L>Pale-quiv'ring o'er a solitary lamp;</L>
<L N="185">Perceives a rev'rend sire, resembling Time,</L>
<L>Down to whose girdle hangs the snowy fleece</L>
<L>Of wintry age. Unaw'd his lamp he rais'd;</L>
<L>A dim reflection from the polish'd arms</L>
<L>Reveal'd the warrior, whom he thus bespake:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
<L N="190">Whate'er thou art, if hostile, or a friend,</L>
<L>A god, a mortal, or a phantom vain,</L>
<L>Know, that my state no change can render worse,</L>
<L>All change make better. Father, soft replied</L>
<L>Th' advancing chief, take comfort, I am come</L>
<L N="195">Thy country's saviour; follow, in the day</L>
<L>See who I am. Between the op'ning band</L>
<L>He leads the senior through the dusky porch,</L>
<L>Whom he accosts before th' unclouded sun,</L>
<L>Then vertical: Rest, father, and behold</L>
<L N="200">Themistocles of Athens. While the priest,</L>
<L>So by his fillet sacerdotal known,</L>
<L>In wonder paus'd, th' artificer divine</L>
<L>Of wiles to catch the sudden turns of chance,</L>
<L>Frames in a momentary cast of thought</L>
<L N="205">This bright device of fiction to allure</L>
<L>A holy mind. O worthy of the god!</L>
<L>Thou servant pure of Jupiter! I mourn,</L>
<L>Like thee, Eretria, not like thee despond.</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="15"/>
Attend, thou righteous votary to heav'n!</L>
<L N="210">I, from the day of Salamis o'ertoil'd,</L>
<L>While courting slumber, in a vision saw</L>
<L>The sapient issue of th' almighty sire,</L>
<L>His best belov'd Minerva. Still the sound</L>
<L>Of her gorgonian shield my ears retain,</L>
<L N="215">While earnest, striking on its rim her spear,</L>
<L>The virgin warrior spake: Triumphant son</L>
<L>Of Neocles, remember in thy joy</L>
<L>The miseries of others. Go, redeem</L>
<L>Eretria fall'n, whose noble remnant arm'd</L>
<L N="220">Sev'n ships, exhausting all their slender stores,</L>
<L>To fight for Athens on this glorious day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As from the sooty gate of direful Dis</L>
<L>Deliver'd Theseus, when to cheering day</L>
<L>He reascended, on Alcides look'd,</L>
<L N="225">Who for his lov'd companion pierc'd the gloom</L>
<L>Of Erebus; th' Eretrian's grateful eyes</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="16"/>
Thus on the son of Neocles were fix'd,</L>
<L>In ecstacy of joy. These fervent words</L>
<L>He utter'd: Heav'n hath giv'n thee to destroy</L>
<L N="230">Presumptuous foes, O favour'd by the gods!</L>
<L>Who give thee now to save despairing friends;</L>
<L>That, all-rejoicing in thy trophies new,</L>
<L>Great as thou art, thy gen'rous soul may prove,</L>
<L>How far beyond the transports conquest yields,</L>
<L N="235">Are those resulting from benignant deeds.</L>
<L>More grateful, chief, is charity's sweet voice,</L>
<L>Than Fame's shrill trumpet, in the ear of Jove,</L>
<L>Who will, on such humanity as thine,</L>
<L>Accumulate his blessings. If my name</L>
<L N="240">Thou ne'er hast heard, or, hearing, hast forgot,</L>
<L>Know, that from lib'ral Cleobulus sprung,</L>
<L>I am Tisander. Interrupting swift</L>
<L>Th' Athenian here: Thy own, thy father's name,</L>
<L>To me, illustrious pontiff, well are known.</L>
<L N="245">My recent banner in the summer's gale</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="17"/>
Thou must remember on th' Eretrian coast.</L>
<L>Eretrian warriors under Cleon's charge,</L>
<L>In ships by me supply'd, undaunted fought</L>
<L>At Artemisium, and an earnest gave</L>
<L>Of their late prowess. From their chief, from all</L>
<L N="251">Thy celebrating countrymen, I heard</L>
<L>Of thee Tisander, and thy name retain;</L>
<L>Proceed. To him the priest: Flow first my tears!</L>
<L>Of that brave band whatever now remains</L>
<L>Have nought but prowess left. Alas! how few</L>
<L N="256">Escap'd thy fell, exterminating hand,</L>
<L>When treachery surrender'd to thy pow'r,</L>
<L>Darius! Sons of husbandry lay hid</L>
<L>In woods and caverns; of the nobler class</L>
<L N="260">Some on the main were absent. Priest of Jove</L>
<L>I was releas'd; a pious, beardless prince,</L>
<L>Nam'd Hyperanthes, on my rank and years</L>
<L>Look'd with compassion; living, I extol,</L>

Within my temple, mourning o'er this waste.</L>
<L>Here, annually collected (Lo! the day</L>
<L>Of that severe solemnity is nigh)</L>
<L>Th' unhappy reliques of Eretrian blood</L>
<L>Accompany my tears. Thou knowst, they sail'd</L>
<L N="270">At thy appointment, on Athenian decks,</L>
<L>They and the men of Styra from that port</L>
<L>For Salamis. In glory they return'd</L>
<L>To want and horror, desert found their land,</L>
<L>Their crops, their future sustenance destroy'd,</L>
<L N="275">Their huts consum'd, their cattle swept away,</L>
<L>Their progeny, their wives; flagitious act</L>
<L>Of Demonax, in Oreus late replac'd,</L>
<L>Her tyrant foul, a slave to Xerxes' throne,</L>
<L>His scourge in rich Euboea, half-reduc'd</L>
<L N="280">To this dire monster's sway, by royal aid</L>
<L>Of endless treasure, and Barbarian bands.</L>
<L>Such is our state. Too scanty are the means</L>
<L>Of willing Styra to relieve such wants;</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="19"/>
Our wealthier neighbours of Carystus vend,</L>
<L N="285">Not give; in hoarded grain, in flocks and herds</L>
<L>Abounding, them a sordid chief controlls,</L>
<L>Nicomachus. An oligarchy rules</L>
<L>Geraestus small, but opulent—O Jove!</L>
<L>I see brave Cleon yonder; from his head</L>
<L N="290">He rends the hair—what gestures of distress!</L>
<L>He beats his troubled bosom, wrings his hands!</L>
<L>Not heeding great Themistocles, he points</L>
<L>On me alone a wild distracted look!</L>
<L>Say Cleon. . . Swift, with shiv'ring lips and pale,</L>
<L N="295">Th' Eretrian leader, interrupting, vents</L>
<L>His tortur'd thoughts: Tisander, can thy pray'rs</L>
<L>Repel grim famine, rushing on the blast</L>
<L>Of barren winter? Three disastrous days</L>
<L>Will lay the combatants for Greece in dust,</L>
<L N="300">Behind them leaving nothing but a name</L>
<L>For Salamis to publish. Lo! they come,</L>
<L>A dying people, suppliant to repose</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="20"/>
Within thy fane their flesh-divested bones.</L>
<L>Yet such a tomb, their fainting voices cry,</L>
<L N="305">May those Eretrians envy who are doom'd</L>
<L>To lodge their captive limbs in Asia's mold.</L>

<L>He ends in sighs. Behold, a ghastly troop</L>
<L>Slow through the ruins of their native streets</L>
<L>In languid pace advance! So gath'ring shoals</L>

<L N="311">The unrelenting eye of Charon views,</L>
<L>By sickness, plague and famine, by the sword,</L>
<L>Or heart-corroding sorrow, sent from light</L>
<L>To pass the black irremeable floods</L>
<L N="315">Of Styx. Cecropia's hero cast a look</L>
<L>Like Phoebus heav'nly-gentle, when, aton'd,</L>
<L>Th' infectious air he clear'd, awak'ning gales</L>
<L>To breathe salubrious o'er th' enfeebled host</L>

<L>The gifts of Ceres in profusion bear,</L>

<L>To these, my fellow warriors, who have seen</L>
<L>My banner streaming, twice have lent their aid</L>

<L>Tisander, happy, entertains his guests,</L>
<L N="340">Twelve hundred countrymen, the last remains</L>
<L>Of populous Eretria. Plenty's boon</L>
<L>Alert the Attic mariners diffuse</L>
<L>To all, and cordial tend their wants; discreet</L>

<L>Or so dispose, that feeblest steps may find</L>
<L>A passage free to good Tisander's fane;</L>
<L>That through its wonted apertures, the round</L>
<L>Of that huge pile, where Jupiter should dwell,</L>
<L N="355">Now dark as Pluto's palace, may admit</L>
<L>The light of heav'n? Yet further, we must search</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="23"/>
For coverts dry, if such the greedy flames</L>
<L>Have left among these ruins, to secure</L>
<L>The various stores, which Cleon may transport.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="360">To him his lord: Go, monitor expert,</L>
<L>Accomplish what thou counsel'st. Tow'rds the fane</L>

<L>On scatter'd fragments of their ancient homes,</L>
<L>Th' Eretrians, pale with long-continu'd want,</L>
<L N="365">Are seated. Thick as winter-famish'd birds</L>
<L>Perch on the boughs, which icicles encrust,</L>
<L>Yet chirp and flutter in th' attemp'ring sun,</L>
<L>These, at the hero's presence, wave their hands,</L>
<L>Unite their efforts in acclaim not loud,</L>
<L N="370">But cordial, rather in a gen'ral sigh</L>
<L>Of gratitude. The charitable care</L>

In battle, hardiest of the naval breed,</L>
<L>Th' Eretrians, worn by hunger, scarce retain</L>
<L>The slender pow'rs of childhood. One by one</L>
<L>Themistocles consoles them, and devotes</L>
<L>In condescension sedulous the day</L>
<L N="380">To kindness not impolitic. In these</L>
<L>His piercing genius fit materials saw</L>
<L>To build another structure of renown.</L>

<L>The prone creation, and delights mankind.</L>

Or ocean's smooth cerulean bosom, shews</L>
<L>The finny tribes in play. The active son</L>
<L>Of Neocles uprises, and descries</L>
<L>A dawn which promis'd purity of air,</L>
<L>Of light and calmness, tempting sloth herself</L>
<L N="15">To action. Thus he rous'd his native fire:</L>

<LG>
<L>Of this kind season not a moment lose,</L>
<L>Themistocles. Sicinus ever nigh</L>
<L>He call'd: Provide two receptacles sure,</L>

<L>Soon Hyacinthus enters; still he shews</L>
<L N="25">The perturbation of a mind oppress'd</L>
<L>By some conceal'd misfortune, while, beneath</L>

The shade of sorrow, on his front appear'd</L>
<L>Excelling graces. Him the chief bespake,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L N="30">Her eastern hill, behold, the morning mounts</L>
<L>In radiance, scatter'd from the liquid gems</L>
<L>On her loose mantle; but the heart of youth</L>
<L>In ev'ry season should rejoice, in clouds</L>
<L>Not less than sunshine, whether nature's voice</L>
<L N="35">Be hoarse in storms, or tune to whisp'ring gales</L>
<L>Her vernal music. Sharp some inward grief,</L>
<L>When youth is sad; yet fortune oft deceives</L>
<L>The inexperienc'd by imagin'd ills,</L>
<L>Or light, which counsel of the more mature</L>
<L N="40">Can lightly heal. Unlock thy lib'ral mind;</L>
<L>To me, a guardian pregnant of relief</L>
<L>Beyond thy father, countrymen, or friends,</L>
<L>Impart thy cares. The sighing guest replied:</L>

<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
<L>To thy controul my service I devote,</L>
<L N="45">O scourge of tyrants, but retain my grief!</L>

<L>Sicinus interrupts; his lord's commands</L>

Distinguish'd late in Artemisium's fight,</L>

<L>The new-made archon in a rev'rent style,</L>
<L>Timoxenus most potent in that state,</L>

<L>Before the sacred image wrung his hands;</L>
<L N="115"><PB N="38" REF="40"/>
Then sinking down, along the pavement roll'd</L>
<L>His body; in distraction would have dash'd</L>

<L>Forgive me, too regardless of thy grace;</L>

<L>Deserves thy frown, yet less than giddy joy,</L>

<L>WHEN Hyacinthus first his couch forsook</L>
<L>Themistocles in care had follow'd close,</L>
<L>But secretly had noted well the pray'r</L>
<L>To Juno sent, and part approving, part</L>
<L N="5">Condemning, heard. Accoutr'd now in mail,</L>
<L>The young Carystian, to his list'ning friend,</L>
<L>Relates the wonders of his recent dream.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Th' Athenian, while most cordial in the care</L>
<L>Of Hyacinthus, whom his woes endear'd,</L>
<L N="10"><PB N="54" REF="56"/>
Still weigh'd his use. This answer he devis'd</L>
<L>To ease the grief he pitied, and preserve</L>
<L>The worth essential to his own designs.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What thou hast told, Carystian, fires my breast;</L>
<L>It was a signal, by Saturnia held</L>
<L N="15">To animate thy rage, and prompt thy arm</L>
<L>To action. She requires not, goddess wise,</L>
<L>Humiliation, scorns the sluggish mind,</L>
<L>Whose thoughts are creeping to Elysian rest.</L>
<L>They hush no throbs of anguish, while it rends</L>
<L>The mangled heartstrings, no not more than staunch</L>
<L N="21">A bleeding wound, or quench a fever's flame.</L>
<L>We earn Elysium, and our evils here</L>
<L>Surmount, alike by action. Manly toil</L>
<L>Repels despair. Endurance of a storm,</L>
<L>Which rocks the vessel, marches long and swift,</L>
<L N="26">A river pass'd, while enemies in front</L>
<L>By whirls of javelins chase the rapid ford,</L>
<L><PB N="55" REF="57"/>
A rampart scal'd, the forcing of a camp,</L>
<L>Are cures of sorrow. In her vision clear</L>
<L N="30">So did heav'n's empress intimate this morn.</L>
<L>Me too she visited in sleep; her voice</L>
<L>My waking thoughts confirm'd; Cleora lives;</L>
<L>Else why the goddess thus: Arise, O son</L>
<L>Of Neocles, of this afflicted youth</L>
<L N="35">Be thou sure guide to rescue his espous'd;</L>

</LG>

<L>The fiction wraps in credulous delight</L>
<L>The young Carystian's confidence, who feels</L>
<L>Circaean magic from his patron's eye,</L>
<L>His tongue, and gesture. He, quick-sighted, turns</L>
<L N="41">To swift advantage his delusion thus:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Come, let me try thy vigour; I am bound</L>
<L>To neighb'ring Styra; fly before thy friend;</L>
<L>Among that gen'rous people, who, their all,</L>

Two gallies sent to Salamis, proclaim</L>
<L>Themistocles approaches. Like a dart,</L>

On little Styra, who, no queen superb</L>

<L>Oh! that her means were equal to her love,</L>

<L>But yon Geraestian oligarchy, foe</L>

Not thrice shall day illuminate your skies,</L>

<L>They have no walls, Eudemus takes the word,</L>
<L>A righteous, brave Geraestian, exil'd late,</L>

<L>A forest thick surrounds them, which affords</L>

<L>Sev'n hundred natives can Geraestus arm,</L>

A galling yoke more fast. The whole defence,</L>
<L>Our oligarchal tyrants have to boast,</L>

<L N="105">Which round Euboea's rude Capharean cape</L>
<L>Had been detach'd thy navy to surround</L>
<L>In Artemisium's conflict. Now apart</L>
<L>Themistocles to Hyacinthus spake,</L>
<L>While in his care he lodg'd a casket seal'd,</L>
<L N="110">Which held the talent promis'd to his sire:</L>

<L>So, when the trumpet's well-known voice proclaims</L>

In darkest marble. Terror, thick with curls</L>

<L>They now had pass'd th' expanded gates, and slow</L>

A figure, grim and ghastly, from the crowd</L>

<L>One bore Cleora; two, robust and fell,</L>

<L>Not far we journey'd; Demonax was near,</L>
<L>Just march'd to waste Eretria's neighb'ring land.</L>
<L>Conducting me to loneliest shades, my guides</L>
<L>Remain'd a while conferring. One, I knew,</L>
<L N="400">Was Dacus, Dacus whom thy sire preferr'd</L>
<L>In trust to all his menials. Words like these</L>
<L>He utter'd: 'Thus Nicomachus enjoin'd;</L>

<L>This said, they gor'd me with repeated wounds;</L>
<L>I sunk before them; they believ'd me dead.</L>
<L>Deep in a pit, o'ergrown with brambles thick,</L>
<L>They left me. Woodmen, haply passing, heard</L>

<L>Each pillar'd mass, and hurl the fragments huge</L>
<L>Against her tow'rs. Anon is terror chang'd</L>

<L>Amid the lustre of meridian day,</L>
<L N="10">In slow procession, solemnly advance</L>
<L><PB N="81" REF="83"/>
A hundred youths in spotless tunics white,</L>
<L>Sustaining argent wands. A vig'rous band</L>
<L>Of sacerdotal servitors succeed,</L>
<L>Who draw by turns the silver-graven shape</L>
<L N="15">Of Dian lofty on a wheeling stage</L>
<L>Of artificial verdure. Virgins tall</L>
<L>A guard surround her, each in flowing snow</L>
<L>Of raiment, gather'd in a rosy knot</L>
<L>Above one knee. They tread in sandals white,</L>
<L N="20">O'erlac'd by roseate bands; behind their necks</L>
<L>Of lilly's hue depend their quivers full;</L>
<L>Hands, which can string their tough and pond'rous bows,</L>
<L>Eyes, darting beams severe, discover strength</L>
<L>Unbroke by wedlock, hearts by love untam'd;</L>
<L N="25">Soft light the silver crescents on their heads</L>

<L>Across her shoulders hangs a quiver large;</L>
<L>Full-fac'd, a crystal moon illumes her hair.</L>

Penthesilea's Amazonian arm</L>

<L>Her port, her aspect, fascinate the sight;</L>
<L>Before her, passing, tow'rs and temples seem</L>

<L>The single object eminent; her neck,</L>
<L N="35">Her arms, the vestment shuts from view prophane;</L>

<L>Eight purple-harness'd steeds of milky hue,</L>
<L>Her axle draw. Before her footstool sits</L>
<L>The vanquisher of Xerxes; to the reins</L>
<L N="40">Of argent lustre his obsequious hand</L>
<L>Themistocles applies. A hundred guards</L>
<L>In burnish'd steel, and plumes like ridges new</L>
<L>Of winter's fleeces, not unmartial rank'd</L>
<L>Behind her wheels; the city's widest space</L>
<L>They reach. To all the people, swarming round,</L>

<L>Impiety and parricide, which spilt</L>

<L>Afflicted city, in thy day of woe</L>
<L>Both to propitiate and conciliate heav'n.</L>
<L>Learn first, no off'ring of a hundred bulls,</L>
<L>Not clouds of incense, nor exhausted stores</L>
<L N="55">Of richest wine can moderate his wrath,</L>
<L>Which visits children for the sire's offence,</L>
<L>And desolates whole nations for the crimes</L>

<L N="60">The jealous thunderer. Happy is your lot;</L>

<L>On him inflicted vengeance by your hands,</L>

<L>And multiply his blessings on yourselves,</L>
<L>Your sons and daughters. Swear then, old and young,</L>
<L N="66"><PB N="84" REF="86"/>
Swear all before the fresh-polluted shrine;</L>
<L>Ere you remove the carnage from that fane,</L>
<L>Unite your valour by a gen'ral oath,</L>

<L>Who slept not distant. He unbars a door,</L>
<L>Which shews the gallery in flames. Down sinks</L>
<L><PB N="132" REF="134"/>
The crackling floor. A main sustaining beam</L>
<L>From end to end, transverse another, stands</L>
<L>Yet unconsum'd. Lo! trembling in his view</L>

His pillow; keener his internal pang,</L>

<L>The titles both of soldier and of friend</L>

Sweet as a vernal flow'r in early prime,</L>
<L>A Grace in manner, Hebè in her form:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="135">Say, gentle sage, of Delphi's rev'rend priest,</L>

Long lost, whom I, unknowing of their fate,</L>

<L N="160">I have been long in Atalantè's isle</L>

<L>The fun'ral honours which the morning pays</L>

That day in battle. Hear the glorious tale,</L>

<L N="170">Distinctly told, their history, their names,</L>
<L>Their birth and deeds, on Hyacinthus most,</L>

<L N="175">Survey this tablet, which before my sight</L>
<L>Thy hero took, with readiness of skill</L>

<L>The wary son of Neocles suspends</L>
<L>Th' attack, till bursting drifts of southern clouds</L>
<L N="191">Beat on the faces of his harrass'd foes</L>
<L>A storm of blinding sleet; then rushes down</L>

The line gives way to Cleon, at a third</L>

<L>By Hyacinthus, boiling with revenge</L>
<L>For his Cleora; while her cruel sire</L>

<L>Hope in an army spiritless by toil,</L>

<L>Tisander, ask'd an audience, and obtain'd</L>
<L><PB N="186" REF="188"/>
My private ear. Themistocles, he said,</L>
<L>If I deliver tidings, which import</L>
<L N="85">Thy present safety, and thy future weal,</L>
<L>I shall exact thy promise in the name</L>
<L>Of all the gods and goddesses to wave</L>
<L>Enquiry, whence I come, or who I am.</L>
<L>First know, that Mindarus, the Persian chief</L>
<L N="90">In Oreus, newly for Thessalia's coast</L>
<L>Embark'd, whose neighb'ring Pagasaean cape</L>
<L>Looks on Euboea. He this day return'd,</L>
<L>And reinforcement from Mardonius brought,</L>
<L>Ten thousand spears. Thessalia hath supply'd</L>
<L N="95">Three thousand more. An army huge defends</L>
<L>Th' Orēan circuit. Further be inform'd</L>
<L>That sev'n Geraestian homicides are sworn</L>
<L>To thy destruction. By their secret wiles</L>
<L>The house of rich Timoxenus was fir'd;</L>
<L N="100">Them in the field hereafter, all combin'd</L>
<L>Against thy head, their sable arms will shew;</L>
<L><PB N="187" REF="189"/>
The hideous impress on their shields is death.</L>
<L>Farewell, thou hero; if my parting step</L>
<L>Thou trace, farewell for ever; else be sure</L>
<L N="105">Again to see me in thy greatest need.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In mystery, Sicinus, not of heav'n,</L>
<L>But human art, immers'd is some event,</L>
<L>Which mocks my utmost fathom; but my course</L>
<L>Is plain. In fruitless search I waste no thought,</L>
<L N="110">Who, as my servant, smiling fortune use,</L>
<L>Nor yet am hers, Sicinus, when she frowns.</L>
<L>Now mark: One passage winds among the hills</L>
<L>Encircling Oreus. When the vanquish'd foe</L>
<L>Her bulwarks sought for shelter, I detach'd</L>
<L N="115">Eretrian Cleon, Hyacinthus brave,</L>
<L>And with Carystian bands Nicanor staid,</L>
<L>Who unoppos'd the strong defile secur'd;</L>
<L>There shall my banner, strengthen'd by the youth</L>
<L>Of Aegae, soon be planted; there shall wait,</L>
<L N="120"><PB N="188" REF="190"/>
Till each auxiliar, thou hast nam'd, arrive,</L>
<L>Then pour on Demonax the storm of war.</L>
<L>Let Troezen's squadron and th' Athenian ride</L>
<L>Before his port, Cleander have the charge.</L>
<L>Speed back to Chalcis; publish these resolves.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="125">They part. Not long Themistocles delay'd</L>
<L>To gain the mountains; nor three days were pass'd</L>
<L>When brave Nearchus, Haliartus bold,</L>
<L>Th' illustrious brothers of Oïlean race,</L>
<L>Great Aeschylus and Timon, with their bands</L>
<L>Arriv'd, and join'd him at the strong defile</L>
<L N="130">Which now contain'd his whole collected force.</L>
<L>Thence he descended on a morning fair,</L>
<L>First of that month, which frequent sees the sun</L>
<L>Through vernal show'rs, distill'd from tepid clouds,</L>
<L>Diffuse prolific beams o'er moisten'd earth</L>

<L>With flow'rs and verdure. Terrible the bands</L>
<L>Succeeding bands expatiate o'er the fields.</L>
<L><PB N="189" REF="191"/>
So when an earthquake rives a mountain's side,</L>
<L>Where stagnant water, gather'd and confin'd</L>
<L N="140">Within a deep vacuity of rock,</L>
<L>For centuries hath slept, releas'd, the floods</L>
<L>In roaring cataracts impetuous fall;</L>
<L>They roll before them shepherds and their flocks,</L>
<L>Herds and their keepers; cottage, fold and stall,</L>
<L N="145">Promiscuous ruins floating on the stream,</L>
<L>Are borne to plains remote. Now Oreus lifts</L>
<L>Her stately tow'rs in sight. Three myriads arm'd</L>
<L>Before the walls hath Demonax arrang'd</L>
<L>In proud defiance. So, at first o'erthrown,</L>
<L N="150">Antaeus huge, uprising in his might</L>
<L>Fresh and redoubled by his parent earth,</L>
<L>Return'd to combat with Alcmena's seed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Wide stretch'd th' Orēan van; the wary son</L>
<L>Of Neocles to equal that extent</L>
<L N="155">Spread his inferiour number. By a front</L>
<L><PB N="190" REF="192"/>
Not depth of line the tyrant he deceiv'd;</L>
<L>But of Athenian veterans he form'd</L>
<L>A square battalion, which the martial bard</L>
<L>Rang'd on the sea-beat verge; the other wing</L>
<L N="160">Is Medon's charge, where thirty shields in file</L>
<L>Compose the Locrian column. Ere the word</L>
<L>Is giv'n for onset, thus his wonted guard</L>
<L>Themistocles addresses: If a troop</L>
<L>In sable cuirass, and with shields impress'd</L>
<L N="165">By death's grim figure, at my head should aim,</L>
<L>Let them assail me; be it then your care,</L>
<L>Postponing other duty, to surround,</L>
<L>To seize and bear them captives from the fight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He march'd; himself the cent'ral phalanx led;</L>
<L N="170">The floating crimson of his plumage known,</L>
<L>Minerva's bird his crest, whose terrors shook</L>
<L>The bloody field of Chalcis, soon proclaim</L>
<L>Themistocles. Now targets clash with shields;</L>
<L><PB N="191" REF="193"/>
Barbarian sabres with Cecropian swords,</L>
<L N="175">Euboean spears with spears in sudden shock,</L>
<L>Bellona mingles. Medon first o'erthrew</L>
<L>Thessalia's line, his temp'rate mind was stung</L>
<L>By indignation; Timon bath'd his lance</L>
<L>In their perfidious blood; Leonteus gor'd</L>
<L N="180">Their dissipated ranks. A chosen troop</L>
<L>To their assistance Lamachus advanc'd;</L>
<L>Him Haliartus met; his sinewy arm,</L>
<L>Which could have quell'd Lycaon, first of wolves,</L>
<L>The Erymanthian, or Aetolian boar,</L>
<L>Smote to the ground the miscreant's bulk deform'd,</L>
<L N="186">Whose band, recoiling, leave the victor space</L>

<L>That shatter'd wing before th' Oïlean swords;</L>
<L>Not with less vigour Aeschylus o'erturn'd</L>
<L N="190">The other. Mindarus in vain oppos'd</L>
<L>Undaunted efforts. Pallas seem'd to fire</L>
<L>Her own Athenians; Neptune, in the shape</L>
<L><PB N="192" REF="194"/>
Of Aeschylus, seem'd landed from his conch</L>
<L>To war, as once on Troy's Sigaean strand;</L>
<L N="195">Or to have arm'd the warrior-poet's grasp</L>
<L>With that strong weapon, which can rock the earth.</L>
<L>Not in the center suddenly prevail'd</L>
<L>Themistocles; the sev'n Geraestians, leagu'd</L>
<L>By hell, combining their assassin points</L>
<L N="200">Against the hero, for a while delay'd</L>
<L>His progress; firmly their united blows</L>
<L>His shield receiv'd. So Hercules endur'd</L>
<L>The sev'nfold stroke of Hydra; but the zeal</L>
<L>Of Iolaüs to assist that god</L>
<L N="205">In his tremendous labour, was surpass'd</L>
<L>By each Athenian, each Laconian guard,</L>
<L>Who never left Themistocles. They watch'd</L>
<L>The fav'ring moment; with a hundred spears</L>
<L>They hedg'd the traitors round, forbade escape,</L>
<L>Clasp'd and convey'd them living from the field.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="193" REF="195"/>
<L N="211">Still Demonax resists; while near him tow'rs</L>
<L>Ariobarzanes, moving rock of war</L>
<L>In weight and stature. Of Euboeans, forc'd</L>
<L>By savage pow'r to battle, numbers low'r</L>
<L N="215">Surrend'ring banners, some to Cleon, some</L>
<L>To humble Styra's well-conducted sword,</L>
<L>And thine, sad youth, a while by glory taught</L>
<L>To strive with anguish, and suspend despair,</L>
<L>Cleora's husband. Mindarus appears,</L>
<L N="220">Who warns the tyrant timely to retreat,</L>
<L>Ere quite envelop'd by the wheeling files</L>
<L>Of Aeschylus and Medon. Lo! in front,</L>
<L>More dang'rous still, amid selected ranks,</L>
<L>Themistocles. The monster gnash'd his teeth;</L>
<L N="225">His impious voice, with execrations hoarse,</L>
<L>Assail'd the heav'nly thrones; his buckler firm</L>
<L>He grasp'd, receding to th' Orēan wall;</L>
<L>Where, under vaulted sheets of missive arms</L>
<L>Whirl'd on his fierce pursuers, through the gates</L>
<L N="230"><PB N="194" REF="196"/>
He rush'd to shelter. Thus a mighty boar,</L>
<L>Of Calydonian strength, long held at bay,</L>
<L>The hunter's point evading, and the fangs</L>
<L>Of staunchest hounds, with undiminish'd ire</L>
<L>Red in his eyes, and foaming from his jaws,</L>
<L N="235">Impetuous plunges in accustom'd woods.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Th' Athenian chief, who sees th' incessant storms</L>
<L>Of darts and arrows from the rampart's height,</L>
<L>Retreats; but swift his numbers, now enlarg'd</L>
<L>By yielding thousands of Euboean race,</L>
<L N="240">Distributes round th' invested town to guard</L>
<L>Each avenue and station. From the sea</L>
<L>Cleander threatens. In his evening tent</L>
<L>The gen'ral views the captives; frowns condemn</L>
<L>The sev'n Geraestians to their former chains.</L>
<L N="245">The hero smiles on Lamachus, the prize</L>
<L>Of Haliartus, and familiar thus:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="195" REF="197"/>
<L>Again, my Tyrian trafficker in slaves,</L>
<L>I greet thee: Son of Lygdamis, what praise</L>
<L>To thy distinguish'd efforts is not due?</L>
<L N="250">This precious head to my disposal yield.</L>
<L>He then proceeds to Lamachus apart:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now take thy freedom, villain; to my use</L>
<L>See thou employ it, else expect to die.</L>
<L>Your land, remember, and your sea are mine;</L>
<L N="255">Soon on the head of Demonax this arm</L>

<L>Thou hast thy option, go. Sicinus, hear;</L>
<L>This man is free; conduct him through the camp.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now from his friends sequester'd, on a couch,</L>
<L N="260">Which never care disturbs, he slept till dawn,</L>
<L>When, rous'd by heralds from the town, again</L>
<L>The leaders he conven'd. Before them came</L>
<L>Arbactus, fierce Barbarian, who began:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="196" REF="198"/>
<L>Themistocles of Athens, in the name</L>
<L N="265">Of Mindarus the Persian, I defy</L>
<L>Thy arm to combat in the listed field;</L>
<L>The same defiance to thy boldest chiefs</L>
<L>Ariobarzanes sends. If you prevail,</L>
<L>The royal host shall quit Euboea's isle,</L>
<L N="270">Which shall submit to Xerxes if you fall.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Up Hyacinthus, Haliartus, start</L>
<L>Indignant. First the young Carystian spake:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Are they so gross in ignorance to hope,</L>
<L>Themistocles will stoop to single fight</L>
<L N="275">With twice-o'erthrown Barbarians, who, unsafe</L>
<L>Behind a rampart, tremble at his pow'r?</L>
<L>But if the Persian Mindarus would try</L>
<L>A Grecian's single valour, O permit,</L>
<L>Themistocles, thy soldier to assert</L>
<L>The Grecian fame. The friend of Medon next:</L>
</LG>
<LG>

<L N="281">The same permission I implore, O chief,</L>
<L>Invincible thyself; that all this host</L>

<L>Themistocles subjoins: Barbarian, go,</L>

<L N="286">For honour, not decision of the doom</L>
<L>Reserv'd for Demonax; whose final lot</L>
<L>Lies in my breast alone. The herald back</L>
<L>To Oreus speeds. The prudent chief pursues:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="290">My Hyacinthus, all thy wrongs I feel;</L>
<L>But, if resentment can afford the grace</L>
<L>I ask thee, lend to policy thy arm:</L>
<L>Take Mindarus thy captive. From thy proofs</L>
<L>Of might and firmness, Haliartus brave,</L>
<L N="295">My wish is lifted high in hope to see</L>
<L>Ariobarzanes gasping at thy feet.</L>

<L>He rises. Straight embattled on the plain,</L>

<L>To Demonax. Still num'rous for defence</L>
<L N="300">Barbarian warriors, and Thessalian, throng</L>

<L N="315">A female image, and the form of Death,</L>
<L><PB N="199" REF="201"/>
Who blasts her graces. Mindarus approach'd</L>
<L>In armour studded bright with orient gems;</L>
<L>His buckler too a shape of beauty pale,</L>
<L>Stretch'd on a fun'ral pyre, exhibits sad;</L>
<L N="320">Of pearl her limbs, of rubies were the flames.</L>
<L>Ere they engage, the Persian warrior thus:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Since my encounter, whether through disdain</L>
<L>Or policy I know not, is refus'd</L>
<L>By your commander, not through fear I know,</L>
<L N="325">Do thou in courtesy disclose thy name,</L>

<LG>
<L>Then tremble, satrap, at my name, the name</L>

<L>Cleora's husband, whom thy barb'rous love</L>
<L>Hath wrong'd, whom hell-born Demonax hath damn'd</L>
<L><PB N="200" REF="202"/>
To ever-during torment, shakes this lance,</L>
<L>By vengeance pointed and invet'rate hate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Young man, rejoins the Persian, on thy grief</L>
<L N="336">I drop a pitying tear, while thou dost wrong</L>
<L>Me clear of wrong to thee. No barb'rous love</L>
<L>Was mine; unconscious of your nuptial tie,</L>
<L>Till she confess'd it to her savage sire,</L>
<L N="340">My flame was holy; not a thought impure</L>
<L>To violate a right could taint my breast.</L>
<L>But that I lov'd her, Hyacinthus, sure</L>
<L>He, who her dear perfections knew so well,</L>
<L>Must wave his wonder; that her fate o'erwhelms</L>
<L N="345">My spirit, never to revive, I feel;</L>
<L>That my disastrous passion caus'd her doom,</L>

<L>If yet thy anguish can a moment look</L>
<L>Compassionate on me—but I forgive</L>
<L N="350">Unjust reproaches from a grief like thine,</L>
<L><PB N="201" REF="203"/>
Which should, which must exceed my own, my own</L>
<L>Exceeding after thine all other woe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now Hyacinthus melted, but observ'd,</L>
<L>That during this sad interview the spear</L>
<L N="355">Of Haliartus at his feet had laid</L>
<L>Ariobarzanes dead. Heart-stung by shame</L>
<L>At his inaction, with so many chiefs,</L>
<L>With such an army, and the godlike son</L>
<L>Of Neocles spectators, he begins</L>
<L N="360">The fight, but recollects that friend's request.</L>
<L>The Persian more effeminate desponds</L>
<L>At past defeats, and present grief renew'd,</L>
<L>Whose weight, though lighter, he less firmly bore,</L>
<L>Than did the hardy Greek his heavier share</L>
<L N="365">Of woe. Yet fearless he maintains the strife</L>
<L>With native force devoid of gymnic skill,</L>
<L>In which confiding Hyacinthus oft</L>
<L>Inverts his spear, and levels bloodless strokes,</L>
<L><PB N="202" REF="204"/>
Still vigilant to ward the hostile point,</L>
<L N="370">Oft o'er his buckler glancing, though impell'd</L>
<L>By active strength. At last a pond'rous blow</L>
<L>Full on the Persian's front descends; a groan</L>
<L>Is heard throughout the rampart as he falls;</L>
<L>The groan redoubles, as the victor bears</L>
<L N="375">That leader captive to th' investing camp.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To his own tent Themistocles admits</L>
<L>The Persian's batter'd, but unwounded limbs;</L>
<L>He praises Hyacinthus; he consoles</L>
<L>The noble foe, commends to healing rest,</L>
<L N="380">And at returning morn salutes him thus:</L>

<LG>
<L>If thee unransom'd, Mindarus, I send</L>
<L>To Oreus, canst thou pity her estate</L>

<L>Of thy own glory longer to support</L>
<L N="385">The worst of men, excluded by his crimes</L>

From heav'n's protection, and the laws of faith?</L>
<L>Wilt thou, to spare whole rivulets of blood</L>

Postpone. Cleander to his station flies.</L>
<L N="495">Serene th' Athenian in array contains</L>

<L>THE morning breaks; Nicanor sudden greets</L>
<L>The gen'ral; welcome tidings in these words</L>
<L>He utters loud: The citadel is won,</L>
<L>The tyrant slaughter'd. With our sacred guide</L>
<L N="5">A rugged, winding track, in brambles hid,</L>
<L>Half up a crag we climb'd; there, stooping low,</L>
<L>A narrow cleft we enter'd; mazy still</L>
<L>We trod through dusky bowels of a rock,</L>
<L>While our conductor gather'd, as he stepp'd,</L>
<L N="10"><PB N="211" REF="213"/>
A clue, which careful in his hand he coil'd.</L>
<L>Our spears we trail'd; each soldier held the skirt</L>
<L>Of his preceding comrade. We attain'd</L>
<L>An iron wicket, where the ending line</L>
<L>Was fasten'd; thence a long and steep ascent</L>
<L N="15">Was hewn in steps; suspended on the sides,</L>
<L>Bright rows of tapers cheer'd our eyes with light.</L>
<L>We reach'd the top; there lifting o'er his head</L>
<L>A staff, against two horizontal valves</L>
<L>Our leader smote, which open'd at the sound.</L>
<L N="20">Behind me Hyacinthus on the rock</L>
<L>Sunk sudden down, pronouncing in his fall</L>
<L>Cleora; I on Hyacinthus call'd.</L>
</LG>

<L>Is this Cleora's husband? cried the priest;</L>
<L>Descend, my Pamphila, my wife, descend.</L>

<L>Which seem'd a passage to some devious cell.</L>
<L>Me by the hand Elephenor remov'd</L>
<L N="30">Precipitate; a grating door of brass</L>
<L>Clos'd on my parting steps. Ascend, he said,</L>
<L>Make no enquiry; but remain assur'd,</L>
<L>His absence now is best. I mount, I rise</L>
<L>Behind a massy basis which upheld</L>
<L N="35">Jove grasping thunder, and Saturnia crown'd,</L>
<L>Who at his side outstretch'd her scepter'd hand.</L>
<L>The troops succeeding fill the spacious dome.</L>
<L>Last, unexpected, thence more welcome, rose,</L>
<L>Detach'd from Medon with five hundred spears,</L>
<L N="40">Brave Haliartus, who repair'd the want</L>

<L>Ye chiefs, auxiliar to the gods profan'd,</L>

<L>Admits of rest, and dreams not of your spears.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="50">With small resistance from a drowsy guard</L>
<L>I seiz'd the gate; the palace soon was forc'd</L>

<L>Blaspheming ev'ry pow'r of heav'n and hell,</L>

Salute Timoxenus, my noble host,</L>

<L>Which, closing at a blow this dang'rous war,</L>
<L>Preserves so many Greeks. Carystian chief,</L>
<L>Accept from me good tidings in return</L>
<L>For thine. Intelligence this hour hath brought,</L>

<L>The naval fort, an inlet to the town</L>

<L>Successive numbers, if the Persian bands</L>
<L>Yet meditate resistance. Not to give</L>
<L N="75">Their consternation leisure to subside,</L>
<L>Against the walls each standard shall advance.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He said, and gave command. The diff'rent chiefs</L>
<L>Head their battalions. Oreus trembling sees</L>
<L>Encircling danger; heralds in their pomp,</L>
<L>Dread summoners, are nigh. Her foreign guard,</L>
<L N="81"><PB N="215" REF="217"/>
Depriv'd of wonted leaders, at the fall</L>

<L>Death in the conquer'd citadel extend</L>
<L>His hideous arms to beckon from the fleet</L>
<L N="85">Cleander's valour, and from swarming tents</L>
<L>Themistocles. On his approach the gates</L>
<L>Are thrown abroad. From all the Persian bands</L>

<L>Pale fear deposits. Thus the yielding masts</L>

Of Demonax, his treasury unspoil'd,</L>

<L>How shall I praise thee? but my bosom wrapt</L>
<L>In long concealment, now to thee alone</L>
<L N="105">Disclos'd, shall warrant my profess'd regard.</L>
<L>Know, that whatever thou hast heard, or seen</L>
<L>Of my Euboean labours, are no more,</L>

<L>Of action. Gold, one necessary means,</L>

<L>Whate'er employs Mardonius, what the time</L>
<L>He takes the field, and where his gather'd stores</L>
<L N="116">Of war deposits. Thessaly provok'd</L>
<L>Long since my just resentment. Ere the king</L>

Of Asia pass'd the Hellespont, I led</L>
<L>Ten thousand Greeks her passes to defend;</L>
<L N="120">By her deserted and betray'd, I march'd</L>

<L>Thou art that man, th' Athenian quick rejoin'd;</L>

<L>This said, he visits Aeschylus below.</L>

<L><PB N="219" REF="221"/>
That Demonax had doom'd his child to death,</L>

Which lull'd and cherish'd a reposing babe,</L>

<L>His dream at Juno's temple; where he saw</L>
<L N="175">The visionary bosom of his bride</L>
<L>Disclose maternal to an infant new</L>
<L>That pillow smooth of lillies. Wan her cheek</L>

<HEAD>BOOK the TWENTIETH.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>AN April zephyr, with reviving sweets</L>
<L>From gay Euboea's myrtle-border'd meads,</L>
<L>Perfumes his breath, scarce ruffling in his course</L>
<L>The pearly robe of morn. A ready skiff</L>
<L N="5">The Carian hero mounts; the gale, though soft,</L>
<L>To him is adverse. From a rapid keel</L>
<L>Of Oreus, lo! Sicinus lifts a sign</L>
<L>Of salutation. Haliartus joins</L>
<L>The faithful man, and joyfully relates</L>
<L N="10">His acquisition of Acanthé's hand.</L>
<L><PB N="244" REF="246"/>
To good Sicinus grateful sounds the tale,</L>
<L>Who thus replies: To Athens I proceed.</L>
<L>No sooner march'd the warriors to their homes,</L>
<L>Than, disengag'd from public care, my lord</L>
<L N="15">Address'd me thus: Sicinus, spread the sail,</L>
<L>To Athens fly; my wife and offspring waft</L>
<L>To my embraces; that, while gentle rest</L>

His whole effulgence. Back to Attic strands</L>
<L>They steer in view. To fifes and trumpets clear</L>

<L>The wind, and checks their progress; but permits</L>

<L>Who had so well accomplish'd all his charge,</L>
<L>Like Jove in judgment, on the plain like Mars,</L>
<L N="40">Sat in oblivion of his arms, which lay</L>
<L>Beside him. O'er the Heliconian hill</L>
<L>In thought he wander'd, and invok'd the Muse</L>
<L>To sing of civic harmony. The Muse</L>
<L>To Aristides, and the conqu'ring son</L>
<L N="45">Of Neocles united, touch'd the lyre</L>
<L>With melody rejoicing at their names.</L>
<L>The Attic warriors throng'd the silent decks,</L>

<L>Which Oeta's cliffs command, the swain reply'd.</L>
<L N="205">New tents on clear Spercheos daily rise</L>
<L>Of Persians banded from their winter holds;</L>
<L>Thou shalt behold them; follow. Both proceed</L>
<L>Along the green expanse Melissa lov'd;</L>
<L>Where genial spring had form'd of tufted shrubs</L>
<L N="210">A florid cincture to the lucid pool</L>
<L>Behind the dome, inviolable seat</L>
<L>Of all the Muses. Thence harmonious nymphs,</L>
<L>Part of Melissa's ministerial choir,</L>
<L>Left in their function, with mellifluent voice</L>
<L N="215">To harps in cadence true enchant the soul</L>
<L><PB N="255" REF="257"/>
Of Haliartus, doubly charm'd to hear</L>
<L>Leonidas the theme. With numbers sweet</L>
<L>His praise inwoven by Melissa's skill</L>
<L>Was their diurnal song. But sorrow soon</L>
<L N="220">Invades a breast, where gratitude presides;</L>
<L>The time and place to Haliartus rise,</L>
<L>Where he and Medon took their last farewell</L>
<L>Of that devoted hero. In a sigh</L>
<L>The Carian thus: O well-remember'd scene</L>
<L N="225">Once to these eyes delectable! Thy flow'rs</L>
<L>Have lost their odour; thy crystalline pool</L>
<L>Is dull in aspect to my sad'ning sight;</L>
<L>You cannot sooth, melodious maids, the pain</L>
<L>Of recollection, starting at the name</L>
<L>Your measures sound. Beneath yon solemn beech</L>
<L N="231">Regret sits weeping; Lacedaemon's king</L>
<L>There of terrestrial music heard the last</L>
<L>From Aeschylus, the last of banquets shar'd</L>
<L>With good Oïleus' daughter. Mycon here:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="256" REF="258"/>
<L N="235">Suppress this grief; the priestess has forbid</L>
<L>All lamentation for that hero's fate,</L>
<L>Who died so glorious. Follow to the cliff.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>They soon attain a high projecting point,</L>
<L>When Haliartus in a second sigh:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="240">Here stood Melissa; from her sacred lips</L>
<L>The queen of Caria hence endur'd reproof;</L>
<L>Hence did the great Leonidas explore</L>
<L>Th' advancing Persians, when his prudent care</L>
<L>The trees and marble fragments had amass'd,</L>
<L N="245">Which from the mountain overwhelm'd below</L>
<L>Such multitudes of foes. But, Mycon, speak,</L>
<L>What is that cross beside the public way?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah! Meliboeus, let thy spirit grieve</L>
<L>Like mine, exclaims, in gushing tears, the swain;</L>
<L><PB N="257" REF="259"/>
Lo! Xerxes' coward vengeance! Thou behold'st</L>
<L N="251">Leonidas suspended on that cross.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As oft, when lightning strikes the human frame,</L>
<L>The wound, though imperceptible, destroys</L>
<L>Each vital pow'r throughout the stiff'ning limbs,</L>
<L N="255">Which still retain their posture; rigid thus</L>
<L>Is Haliartus; riveted to earth</L>
<L>He seems, nor utters sound, nor breathes, nor moves</L>
<L>His ghastly eyeballs. Now, when Mycon thrice</L>
<L>His name repeated, briefly he replies:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="260">I am benumb'd—Conduct me to a cell</L>
<L>Where I may slumber—Tend thy herd—Expect</L>
<L>Me at thy home. A mossy cave is nigh;</L>
<L>There Mycon leaves him. Haliartus stays,</L>
<L>Not slumb'ring, but, when Mycon is remote,</L>
<L N="265">Darts from the shelter, traverses a wood,</L>
<L>Descends a crag, which bounds the upper straits,</L>
<L><PB N="258" REF="260"/>
Thence winds his rapid journey to the cross,</L>
<L>Which stands a witness of Barbaric rage.</L>
<L>His ardent zeal to free those honour'd bones</L>
<L>Admits no pause. The midnight watch is past;</L>
<L N="271">Importunate and hateful, birds obscene</L>
<L>Are gather'd round; disturb'd, their grating shrieks</L>
<L>They mix, and clatter their ill-omen'd wings.</L>
<L>A station'd guard is rous'd; resistless force</L>
<L N="275">Surrounds the Carian, seizes, leads him bound</L>
<L>Before the chieftain of a camp advanc'd.</L>
<L>He, at the sight of Haliartus charg'd</L>
<L>With guilt, whose punishment is death, commands</L>
<L>Th' accusing soldiers to retire, and thus:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="280">Alas! hath sorrow so impair'd the hue</L>
<L>Of Artamanes, that oblivion masks</L>
<L>His face from Haliartus. Thee I know,</L>
<L>Thee Meliboeus once, benignant swain,</L>
<L>My comforter in bondage, when we plough'd</L>
<L N="285"><PB N="259" REF="261"/>
The Grecian seas in Delphian Timon's bark.</L>
<L>Was not I present, when the genuine seed</L>
<L>Of Lygdamis in thee Aronces trac'd?</L>
<L>But, O! illustrious brother of a queen</L>
<L>Ador'd in Asia, what disastrous star</L>
<L N="290">Thy midnight steps misguided, to incur</L>
<L>The king's immutable decree of death?</L>
<L>Thy bold attempt was virtuous, but his will</L>
<L>Hath made thy virtue criminal. Thy head</L>
<L>At his own peril Artamanes still</L>
<L N="295">Shall guard; thy liberty accept; myself</L>
<L>Will be thy guide to safety. Ah! replies</L>
<L>The gen'rous son of Lygdamis, and clasps</L>
<L>The meritorious Persian, I perceive</L>
<L>Still unimpair'd thy virtues; but receive</L>
<L N="300">Thy noble proffer back. For my behoof</L>
<L>Not with its shadow danger shall approach</L>
<L>My friend; thy pris'ner let me rest till morn.</L>
<L>A lib'ral garb is all the boon I crave,</L>
<L><PB N="260" REF="262"/>
Then to Mardonius lead me; tell my crime,</L>
<L N="305">No grace solicit; who I am, conceal.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In tears, replied the satrap: Then thou diest;</L>
<L>The royal edict cannot be controll'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>It can, return'd the Carian; rest assur'd,</L>
<L>My preservation in myself I bear.</L>
<L N="310">Oh! that with equal certainty my pow'r</L>
<L>Might from thy bosom chace that inmate new,</L>
<L>Whate'er it be, which violates thy peace,</L>
<L>Thy early youth disfigures, and consumes</L>
<L>Its fruit unripe. Ah! tell me, is it grief</L>
<L N="315">For some dead friend, or sickness, or the smart</L>
<L>Of injury, or love? Acanthè wak'd</L>
<L>That tender thought, which soften'd on the tongue</L>
<L>Of Haliartus. From the Persian's breast</L>
<L>A sigh, deep note of agony, which riv'd</L>
<L N="320">His gentle heart, accompanied these words:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="261" REF="263"/>
<L>Endear'd associate in affliction past,</L>
<L>Thou, and thou only, dost unlock the breast</L>
<L>Of Artamanes. It is love, my friend;</L>
<L>The object, once possessing ev'ry charm</L>
<L N="325">Exterior, still each beauty of the soul,</L>
<L>By malady incurable devour'd</L>
<L>From day to day is hast'ning to the tomb.</L>
<L>Oh! long deplor'd Sandaucè; thee my steps</L>
<L>Shall follow close—My passion is unknown</L>
<L N="330">To her; peculiar was her state and mine,</L>
<L>Too delicate at first for me to speak,</L>
<L>For her to hear. My hopes malignant time</L>
<L>Hath wasted since, my health in her decay.</L>
<L N="334">But while my heart is bleeding for my love,</L>
<L>The sluice grows wider, and to friendship pours</L>
<L>A stream enlarg'd. Thy danger—Ah! permit,</L>
<L>That I reveal thy origin and rank;</L>
<L>Thy sister's name can shake the king's decree.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="262" REF="264"/>
<L>No, Artamanes, by th' immortal gods,</L>
<L N="340">Rejoins the Carian; of my just attempt,</L>
<L>I, if succeeding, all the merit knew,</L>
<L>If taken, knew my ransom. But the stars,</L>
<L>Half through their circles run, suggest repose.</L>
<L>May grief-asswaging heaviness of sleep</L>
<L N="345">Embalm thy eyelids, and like mine thy breast</L>
<L>Feel no disquiet; mayst thou rise again,</L>
<L>Saluting hope the harbinger of peace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Stretch'd on a carpet Haliartus slept;</L>
<L>Not so the troubled Persian, long disus'd</L>
<L N="350">To lenient rest. Before the dawn he rose;</L>
<L>Among the Greek auxiliars he procur'd</L>
<L>Apparel fair of Greece. His Carian guest</L>
<L>Attir'd he guided o'er the Malian beach,</L>
<L>To that august pavilion, which contain'd</L>
<L N="355">The royal person once, Mardonius now</L>
<L>In all the state of Xerxes, save the crown.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="263" REF="265"/>
<L>Thus Artamanes: See a hapless man,</L>
<L>Who hath attempted to remove the corse</L>
<L>Of Sparta's king. That hapless man must die,</L>
<L N="360">Returns the gen'ral; Xerxes so ordain'd,</L>
<L>Not I. Then absent on a charge remote,</L>
<L>Mardonius knew not, nor approv'd when known,</L>
<L>Th' indignity that noble corse sustain'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To him the Carian: Mindarus to death,</L>
<L N="365">With hecatombs of nobles thou decreest,</L>
<L>Who in Euboea will appease my ghost.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ha! who art thou, in agitation spake</L>
<L>The satrap? Guard, bid Lamachus approach,</L>
<L>Our visitor so recent from that isle.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="370">He was not far; the son of Gobryas thus</L>
<L>Address'd him ent'ring: Note that stranger well.</L>
<L>Why dost thou start? Themistocles can boast</L>
<L><PB N="264" REF="266"/>
No bolder warrior, Lamachus exclaim'd;</L>
<L>I was his captive in th' Orēan fight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Again the Carian: Truth for once he speaks;</L>
<L N="376">I dragg'd him bound my captive on that field;</L>
<L>Ariobarzanes felt me; further learn,</L>
<L>By me the savage Demonax was slain.</L>
<L>But to have rescu'd from inhuman wrong</L>
<L N="380">The mortal part of that transcendent man,</L>
<L>Who living shook all Asia with dismay,</L>
<L>Had been my proudest boast. Mardonius then:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>By Horomazes, I admire and prize</L>
<L>Thy gen'rous flame, brave warrior! Under charge</L>
<L N="385">Of Artamanes in Trachiniae's round</L>
<L>Awhile remain. Now, Lamachus, ascend</L>
<L>Some ready bark; revisit yonder isle;</L>
<L>This Greek for Mindarus exchange; redeem</L>
<L>The rest of Asia's nobles; I allot</L>
<L N="390"><PB N="265" REF="267"/>
For each a talent. In these words salute</L>
<L>Themistocles: "To Athens I have sent</L>
<L>"Young Alexander, Macedonia's prince,</L>
<L>"Ambassador of friendship; I would call</L>
<L>"Themistocles ally; himself may name,</L>
<L N="395">"But Persia's bounty shall exceed his price.</L>
<L>"This if his Attic arrogance rejects,</L>
<L>"Tell him, Mardonius, who disdains a war</L>
<L>"Of oars and sails, the dubious ocean's sport,</L>
<L>"Will give him battle on the plains of Thebes."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="400">Though Artamanes joyfully beholds</L>
<L>His friend in safety, with a trembling step</L>
<L>Trachiniae's gates he passes to the roof,</L>
<L>Which holds Sandaucè. Ent'ring, he perceives</L>
<L>Melissa. She, transported at the sight</L>
<L N="405">Of Haliartus, thus began: O friend!</L>
<L>Dear to my sire, to all th' Oïlean house,</L>
<L>What unexpected ecstacy were mine</L>
<L><PB N="266" REF="268"/>
At thy appearance, if—Ah! Persian lord,</L>
<L>Sandaucè, sweet Sandaucè, yields to fate.</L>
<L N="410">Her dying lips on Artamanes call;</L>
<L>Soft gratitude o'erflows her gentle breast;</L>
<L>Her wish is eager, ere she breathe her last,</L>
<L>To see her friend and guardian. Ending here,</L>
<L>She moves before him; with unstable feet,</L>
<L N="415">With other prompters, anguish and despair,</L>
<L>He follows. Pallid on her mournful couch</L>
<L>The princess lies; her infants weep around;</L>
<L>Bright Amarantha in disorder'd garb,</L>
<L>Unloosen'd hair, and frantic with distress,</L>
<L N="420">Stands nigh. The graces sadden on her front;</L>
<L>Her beauteous eyes a gushing torrent pour</L>
<L>Like overswelling fountains, once serene</L>
<L>The lucid mirrors to encircling flow'rs,</L>
<L>Now troubled by a storm, which levels round</L>
<L N="425">The growth of shade, and scatters on their face</L>
<L>Uprooted shrubs in bloom. Her languid lips</L>
<L>At length unclosing, thus Sandaucè spake:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="267" REF="269"/>
<L>Omniscient God of nature! let me lift</L>
<L>My voice appealing. When before me lay</L>
<L>Autarctus slaughter'd, when these babes, condemn'd</L>
<L N="431">By cruel rites, to sacrifice were led,</L>
<L>Did not the creature of thy tend'rest mold</L>
<L>Feel as a wife, a mother, and receive</L>
<L>A cureless wound? Thy providence uprais'd</L>
<L N="435">A kind protector through my lengthen'd walks</L>
<L>Of grief, till now they terminate in death.</L>
<L>If to his gen'rous purity of care,</L>
<L>Assiduous, kind and pious, time hath rais'd</L>
<L>Within my breast a secret, soft return,</L>
<L N="440">Was this an error? Hath my heart abus'd</L>
<L>The sensibility, thou gav'st? Alone</L>
<L>Art thou my judge. Creator, I obey;</L>
<L>Before thy awful presence thou dost call</L>
<L>Sandaucè's youth; unconscious of a crime,</L>
<L N="445">My debt avow'd of gratitude I pay</L>
<L>By this confession of my fleeting breath</L>
<L><PB N="268" REF="270"/>
To Artamanes. O! illustrious youth,</L>
<L>Supreme in rank, in virtue still more high,</L>
<L>Thy care continue to these orphan babes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She ceas'd, and speechless on her pillow sunk.</L>
<L N="451">Th' enamour'd Persian instant on the floor</L>
<L>Dropp'd, like a stony mass, which inward throes</L>
<L>Of earth convulsive from a cliff disjoins;</L>
<L>Dead monument of ruin on the beach</L>
<L N="455">Immoveable it lies. Melissa calls</L>
<L>On Haliartus; suddenly he bears</L>
<L>The hapless youth, inanimate and cold,</L>
<L>To an adjoining chamber. There outstretch'd,</L>
<L>Restor'd to sense by kind, unwearied zeal</L>
<L N="460">In Haliartus, all the night he roam'd</L>
<L>Through sad delirium's labyrinths till morn;</L>
<L>When lo! Melissa: Comfort thee, she said,</L>
<L>The princess lives; the burden from her mind</L>
<L>Discharg'd, hath render'd to the pow'rs of life</L>
<L N="465"><PB N="269" REF="271"/>
Exertion less confin'd, rekindling hope</L>
<L>Of restoration. So th' all-ruling gods</L>
<L>Vicissitude to nature have decreed;</L>
<L>The mind, the body languishes to-day,</L>
<L>Revives to morrow. . . . Interrupting came</L>
<L>Mardonius thus: What tidings have I heard</L>
<L N="471">Of Artamanes and the princess dead</L>
<L>By malady most rare, a mutual flame</L>
<L>Too long conceal'd? But ent'ring I receiv'd</L>
<L>A milder tale; they live. Thou holy Greek!</L>
<L N="475">Employ thy science; save a lovely dame,</L>
<L>Though Persian born; in him preserve my friend;</L>
<L>Mardonius, long thy country's foe, to thee</L>
<L>Will ne'er be hostile. To Sandaucè go,</L>
<L>Say from my lips, and, Artamanes, hear,</L>
<L N="480">The flow'r of nobles Xerxes shall not lose</L>
<L>Through disappointed passion; were my friend</L>
<L>Less than he is, among the satraps least,</L>
<L>At my enforcement shall the king unite</L>
<L><PB N="270" REF="272"/>
Their nuptial hands. Now rouse thee, gallant youth,</L>
<L N="485">Not long thy gen'ral from his side can spare</L>
<L>Thy worth approv'd. Masistius is remote;</L>
<L>In virtue rich beyond a mortal's share,</L>
<L>But to that virtue never yielding rest,</L>
<L>He for a time on high adventure bent</L>
<L N="490">Hath left me; thou his vacant place must fill.</L>
<L>The son of Gobryas to his tent returns.</L>
