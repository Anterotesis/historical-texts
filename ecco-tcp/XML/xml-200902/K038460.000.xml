<L>HERE day and night in sweet succession vie,</L>

<L>Flies o'er the roof and in the midland falls;</L>
<L>Above the rocks, these fighting whirlpools tower</L>
<L>The lofty rocks, and fall a misty shower,</L>
<L>Like smoke from hot Bellona's bowels fly,</L>

<L>Now night with her black robe invelops all,</L>
<L>Now horror hides the loud beleaguer'd ball.</L>
<L>With grandeur here wild winter roars around,</L>
<L>Here echoing hills and rocks repeat the sound;</L>
<L>In harmony made grateful to the ear,</L>
<L>That strikes with majesty and awes with fear;</L>
<L>With pride the bold inhabitants endure</L>
<L>The storm magnificent; themselves secure:</L>
<L>Triumphant here they hug their blissful lot,</L>
<L>And all this hostile rage is soon forgot.</L>

<L>Oh madding mortals! spare your mother! spare!</L>

<L>Why dig so deep? why frenzy's thirst improve?</L>
<L>Since all that wisdom wants o'erflows above:</L>

The second should dash out the horror of the rugged cliffs, steeps and ocean, while the grand pencil of Poussin, should crown the whole with the majesty of the impending mountains.—The Editor cannot help adding, that a walk by moon-light, (at which time the many waterfalls are heared in all their variety of sounds) in this inchanting situation, opens a scene of such delicate beauty, repose and solemnity, as exceeds all description.</NOTE>;</L>

<L>Along the tented shore shall beauty skim,</L>
<L>The bosom bright shall lave the lovely limb;</L>
<L>New kindled orbs shall strike with sweet surprize,</L>
<L>As stars relumin'd from the ocean rise;</L>
<L><PB N="xxxxiv" REF="46" MS="y"/>No more to foreign baths shall Britain roam,</L>
<L>But plunge at Cowes and find rich health at home:</L>
<L>Thither shall merit and shall beauty throng,</L>
<L>Proclaim it's worth and vindicate my song;</L>
<L>Through future times the raptur'd muse can see,</L>
<L>What years unborn shall joyful bring to thee;</L>
<L>Thy crowded ports with trade shall rich run o'er,</L>
<L>And stately structures glitter on thy shore;</L>
<L>The world shall find thee and with wonder tell,</L>
<L>That Vecta's shining scenes the world excel;</L>
<L>Thou precious cabinet where nature locks,</L>
<L>Her richest gems within thy beauteous rocks;</L>
<L>Thou casket fill'd with all her choicest store,</L>
<L>Of matter freely, but of fancy more;</L>
<L>The muse prophetic shall thy bliss foretel,</L>
<L>And on that theme with raptur'd note shall dwell:</L>
<L>Concord shall here assume the social smile,</L>
<L>And envy fade and faction fly the isle;</L>
<L>Friendship and virtue shall thy sons unite,</L>
<L>Discord shall die and harmony delight;</L>
<L>Firm loyalty and truth shall bless the land,</L>
<L>And health shall crown, and <HI>Holmes</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Leonard Troughear Holmes, Esq. of Westover Lodge, Successor to the late Lord Holmes, who died Governor of the Island, in 1764.</NOTE> shall lead the band.</L>
