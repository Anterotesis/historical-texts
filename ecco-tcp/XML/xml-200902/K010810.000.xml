<LG>
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<L>FROM prime of youth to hoary age</L>
<L>In this lone cell I've dwelt;</L>
<L>Here sought, by tracing Nature's page,</L>
<L>To soothe the pangs I felt.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<L>The moss-wove oaks that near my cave</L>
<L>In sullen grandeur stand,</L>
<L>And o'er its broken summit wave,</L>
<L>Were acorns in my hand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<L>Those time-shook tow'rs, which all forsake,</L>
<L>Erect, and gay, I've seen;</L>
<L>And half of yon translucent lake,</L>
<L>A flow'r-enamell'd green.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<L>When shall my penitence and pray'rs</L>
<L>Obtain the boon I crave?</L>
<L>When shall my thorny bed of cares</L>
<L>Become my peaceful grave?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<L>Oh worshipp'd reliques! holy book!</L>
<L>Detain my mental eye;</L>
<L>Nor let it ever backward look</L>
<L>To trace sad memory.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<L>Or thou! memorial cross of God,</L>
<L>My whole attention seize!</L>
<L>And bow my heart upon the sod,</L>
<L>Worn daily by my knees.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
<HEAD>VII.</HEAD>
<L>Alas! not Piety can heal</L>
<L>The soul convuls'd with guilt;</L>
<L>Nor all her fountains cleanse the steel</L>
<L>Which human blood has spilt.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>VIII.</HEAD>
<L>Ah! let me ease it then, and speak</L>
<L>The long, long treasur'd tale;</L>
<L>What bitter griefs first bade me seek</L>
<L>The silence of this vale.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>IX.</HEAD>
<L>Near Cheviot Hills I drew the air</L>
<L>On Aran's pleasant plain;</L>
<L>My mother was of presence fair,</L>
<L>Her sire an aged swain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>X.</HEAD>
<L>To tend the flocks was my employ,</L>
<L>Nor ever heav'd my breast,</L>
<L>When my fond mother blest her boy,</L>
<L>At rising, and at rest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
<HEAD>XI.</HEAD>
<L>Yet oft with tears and smiles she strove,</L>
<L>And as I bent my knee,</L>
<L>She'd cry, "be juster to thy love,</L>
<L>Than mine has been to me."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>XII.</HEAD>
<L>Yet little note of this I took,</L>
<L>Unskill'd in worldly harms,</L>
<L>And more admir'd my flow'r-bound crook,</L>
<L>Than her unequall'd charms.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>XIII.</HEAD>
<L>The lowly cot, and shepherd's life,</L>
<L>Each night, each morn, she prais'd;</L>
<L>And when they spoke of warlike strife,</L>
<L>With terror on me gaz'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>XIV.</HEAD>
<L>For now the wars of Palestine</L>
<L>Brave Coeur de Lion fought;</L>
<L>While all admir'd the zeal divine,</L>
<L>And with his deeds were fraught.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
<HEAD>XV.</HEAD>
<L>The glorious talk to me was good;</L>
<L>And as it fill'd my ear,</L>
<L>I seem'd to cleave the founding flood,</L>
<L>Or grasp a fancied spear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>XVI.</HEAD>
<L>When, lo! the neighbouring Scots, a band</L>
<L>Rough as their native rocks,</L>
<L>Rush'd like a whirlwind o'er the land,</L>
<L>And swept away our flocks.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>XVII.</HEAD>
<L>By many an art my mother try'd</L>
<L>My vengeance to restrain;</L>
<L>But anger argument defy'd,</L>
<L>And ev'n her tears were vain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>XVIII.</HEAD>
<L>Each swain I bade renounce his crook;</L>
<L>Each swain obey'd my voice;</L>
<L>The ravagers we soon o'ertook,</L>
<L>And left them not a choice.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
<HEAD>XIX.</HEAD>
<L>No parle did either party use,</L>
<L>Impell'd by fierce disdain;</L>
<L>One sought as men who'd all to lose,</L>
<L>The other to regain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>XX.</HEAD>
<L>Day faintly purpled o'er the sky</L>
<L>When the fell fight began;</L>
<L>But ere our stubborn foes would fly,</L>
<L>The Sun his course had ran.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>XXI.</HEAD>
<L>Thus we retriev'd our fleecy store,</L>
<L>So late bewail'd as lost,</L>
<L>And seem'd, I ween, to love them more,</L>
<L>For all the blows they cost.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>XXII.</HEAD>
<L>Not Richard's self his warriors led</L>
<L>More proudly o'er the deep,</L>
<L>Than I for Aran's pastures sped,</L>
<L>Surrounded by my sheep.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
<HEAD>XXIII.</HEAD>
<L>As nigh I drew, the clouds did roll</L>
<L>A crimson o'er the night;</L>
<L>The valley flam'd—and my full soul</L>
<L>Died in me at the fight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>XXIV.</HEAD>
<L>Another band of those who roam</L>
<L>Our hamlet had destroy'd:</L>
<L>And while we fought to guard our home,</L>
<L>Had made that home a void.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>XXV.</HEAD>
<L>A while I wept, and duteous sought</L>
<L>My parents dear remains;</L>
<L>At length my heart, with vengeance fraught,</L>
<L>An useless grief disdains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>XXVI.</HEAD>
<L>I rouz'd the swains who yet deplor'd</L>
<L>Each desolated field;</L>
<L>I turn'd my sheep-hook to a sword,</L>
<L>My scrip into a shield.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
<HEAD>XXVII.</HEAD>
<L>The savage Scots I swore t'annoy</L>
<L>With ever-loud alarms,</L>
<L>And from a simple shepherd-boy,</L>
<L>Became renown'd in arms.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>XXVIII.</HEAD>
<L>Between both lands strong tow'rs I rear</L>
<L>With captive ensigns bright:</L>
<L>One nation gaz'd on them with fear;</L>
<L>The other with delight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>XXIX.</HEAD>
<L>Around I station'd many a band,</L>
<L>Who dubious stragglers sought;</L>
<L>And ah! one day, by love's command,</L>
<L>A matchless beauty brought.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>XXX.</HEAD>
<L>Her mien majestic seem'd to speak</L>
<L>Th' unsullied soul within;</L>
<L>No rose like that on her pure cheek</L>
<L>Blooms o'er the face of sin.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
<HEAD>XXXI.</HEAD>
<L>Oh! not in grace the mountain pine</L>
<L>With her slight form could vye,</L>
<L>The blue that paints the arch divine</L>
<L>Was faint to her bright eye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>XXXII.</HEAD>
<L>Like a rich group of yellow sheaves,</L>
<L>In ringlets wild, her hair</L>
<L>Play'd on her breast—so Autumn leaves</L>
<L>Hang on the lily fair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>XXXIII.</HEAD>
<L>Awe-struck, my soul imbib'd a flame</L>
<L>As virtuous as sincere;</L>
<L>Nor dared I boldly ask the name,</L>
<L>I most desir'd to hear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>XXXIV.</HEAD>
<L>Unconscious of her beauty's blaze,</L>
<L>She drew away the shade;</L>
<L>With dignity endur'd my gaze,</L>
<L>And thus to speak essay'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
<HEAD>XXXV.</HEAD>
<L>"Although by force I hither bend</L>
<L>"The captive of thy sword,</L>
<L>"From brutal hands I seek a friend,</L>
<L>"Nor need I own a Lord.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>XXXVI.</HEAD>
<L>"Of English blood thy servant came,</L>
<L>"Not from a hostile line,</L>
<L>"Lord Ethel is my Father's name,</L>
<L>"And Ethelinda mine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>XXXVII.</HEAD>
<L>"To Scotland with my Mother sent,</L>
<L>"A Grandsire's eyes to close,</L>
<L>"Her sum of days like his are spent,</L>
<L>"With him she finds repose.</L>
</LG>

<HEAD>XXXVIII.</HEAD>
<L>"Ev'n now on silver Severn's side</L>
<L>"My Father anxiously</L>
<L>"Forgets the day my Mother dy'd,</L>
<L>"To look in vain for me.</L>
</LG>

<HEAD>XXXIX.</HEAD>
<L>"By Knighthood's holy laws, oh Youth!</L>
<L>"I therefore claim your gage,</L>
<L>"That you yield him with care, and truth,</L>
<L>"The darling of his age.</L>

<L>"So may the peace to him you give</L>
<L>"With large increase return;</L>
<L>"So crown'd with conquest may you live,</L>
<L>"And glory crown your urn!"</L>

<HEAD>XLI.</HEAD>
<L>"Be safe," I cried, "thou lovely Maid;</L>

<L>"By Knighthood's holy laws I swear,</L>

<L>"To horse, to horse, each vassal knight,</L>

<L>And soon my warriors o'er the waste</L>
<L>In gay profusion roll;</L>
<L>The Lady in the centre plac'd,</L>

<HEAD>XLVI.</HEAD>
<L>Still as we journied on, I sought,</L>

<L>'Till I had won her heart.</L>

<L>And now my fears would often hint</L>
<L>Her Sire might prove unkind,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>XLVIII.</HEAD>
<L>"Ah doubt not, Edmund,"—she would say,</L>
<L>"Thy worth must all engage;</L>
<L>"Nor dare I scorn a father's sway,</L>
<L>"Nor dare I grieve his age.</L>

<L>"His silver'd head, as lilies bow,</L>

<L>"More fondly draws the heart's dear chain,</L>

<L>Fill'd with her love, sooth'd with her hope,</L>

<L>The sun unheeded veil'd his head,</L>
