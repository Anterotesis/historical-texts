<P>THIS Work, upon its first Appearance in the English Language, having met with the most favourable Reception, and been uni∣versally approved as one of the properest Books that could be put into the Hands of Children; the Publisher has been induced to bring for∣ward a Second Edition of it, but in a State considerably improved; for besides the Inser∣tion of many original Pieces not to be found in the former Edition, the present has been corrected throughout with the most scrupulous Regard to Expression and Uniformity, and may therefore be looked upon as almost entirely a new Translation.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE OF THE TRANSLATOR,</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the Task of writing to improve the Minds of Children may be less productive of literary Fame than many other Studies, yet in its real Importance and Utility, it yields to none, even of the sublimest Speculations. To impress the Infant Mind with a Love of Decency and Virtue, to fortify it against the Influence of Prejudice and Corruption, and at once to gratify the Curiosity and improve the Reason, is an Undertaking which would not disgrace the most enlightened Understanding. If the Eye of the Philosopher can be gratified in merely tracing the Progress of organized Bodies, from their earliest Pe∣riods of Existence, to perfect Maturity, how much greater must be the Pleasure of considering the suc∣cessive Development of the noblest Work of Provi∣dence, the human Mind! A common Eye, indeed, may view with Indifference the Sports and Agitations of Children; their Joys, their Griefs, their Passions and their Hopes, may appear too trivial to engage its Attention; not so the Man whose Feeling renders him alive to all the Interests of the Species, whose
<PB N="v" REF="5"/>Penetration enables him to foresee the mighty Revolu∣tions which may be produced by the Virtues or Vices of an Individual. It was thus the philosophic Eye remarked in the youthful Alexander that vast Ambition which was to ravage the Globe, and change the Fate of Nations; it was thus that Popedius Silo discovered in the Infant Cato that stubborn and inflexible Virtue, which so long opposed the Tide of Caesar's Fortune, and supported the dying Liberties of Rome.</P>
<P>But if the simple Consideration of future Greatness or distinguished Virtue be thus agreeable to a cultiva∣ted Mind, how much more interesting must be the Spectacle, when we consider ourselves as constituting no trifling Part of the future Drama. In this Light may every Man justly consider himself, who devotes his Talents and his Assiduity to the Service of the rising generation. How truly noble are those Exer∣tions which are thus directed to the Service of human Nature, in the Discharge of the most important, though last attractive Duties; and which neglecting Fame, can offer up Ambition itself, a voluntary Sa∣crifice to the Interest of Posterity.</P>
<P>The Author of the present Work may deservedly rank among the foremost of this deserving Class. His Merit as a Writer is so well established upon the Con∣tinent, and even in our own Country, that it is almost superfluous to say any Thing upon the Subject. His easy and elegant Pen seems to be particularly adapted to describe Nature in its most beautiful Forms. The lively Passions, the volatile Tastes, the glowing Co∣lours, and the sportive Graces of blooming Infancy,
<PB N="vi" REF="6"/>are all at his Command. But here, for once, the Copy may be allowed to exceed the Original. His elegant Pencil seems to have given a Consistency and Perma∣nency which Nature had denied. Under such a Master nothing is cold or inanimate; the very Caprices and Levities of Infancy become interesting Scenes, which gradually warm the Heart, and captivate the Attention. The lighter and more sportive Parts of his Work, ex∣hibit all the opening Graces of the young Thalia; while Melpomene herself blushes with Astonishment to find the variable Passions and short-lived Distresses of an Infant Theatre so nearly resemble her own.</P>
<P>We flatter ourselves, therefore, that we shall offer to unacceptable Present to the Public, in giving a com∣plete Translation of all the Works of the admired M. BERQUIN. As to the Accuracy of the Translation, it becomes us to be silent; nor do we pretend to any higher Merit than that of being faithful Imitators of a great Original. It will be a sufficient Reward for all our Labours, if they tend to naturalize so excellent a Work in our own Country; and if we can flatter ourselves with having thus contributed to form the Hearts, and improve the Understandings, of the rising Generation.</P>

<HEAD>THE AUTHOR's PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Work has a double Object in view, to amuse Children, and at the same Time to incline them naturally to Virtue, by always presenting it to them under the most amiable Form. Instead of those extravagant Fictions, those romantic and marvellous Tales, which have so long contributed to lead the Imaginations of Children astray, we here exhibit to them only such Adventures as they may be Witnesses to in private Life every Day. The Senti∣ments with which the Author endeavours to inspire them are not above their Capacities, and he represents them accompanied only by their Equals, their Parents, their Play-fellows, the Servants who are always about them, and the Animals familiar to their View. They express themselves in their own native Simplicity of Language, and in Proportion as they are affected by the Incidents described, they indulge the free Move∣ment of their little Passions. Their Punishments are made the Consequences of their own proper Faults, and their Rewards consist in the Pleasure which they derive from their good Actions. Every Thing here disposes
<PB N="viii" REF="8"/>them to love Virtue for the Sake of their own Happi∣ness, and to deter them from Vice as from a Source of Sorrows and Mortification.</P>
<P>It is, perhaps, needless to remark, that this Work is equally calculated for Children of either Sex. The Difference of their Tastes and Characters is not yet at their Age sufficiently strong to require to be differently delineated. Besides, Care has been taken to bring Children of both Sexes together as often as possible, in order to produce that Union and Intimacy which we are so pleased to see subsist between Brothers and Sis∣ters.</P>
<P>The Author has endeavoured to introduce a Variety in the different Pieces which compose each Volume. There is not one of them, the Effect of which has not previously been tried on Children more or less advanced in Age and Understanding, and every Thing has been retrenched that did not seem sufficiently to interest their Feelings. Each Volume of this Work will contain little Dramas, in which Children, are the principal Characters, in order that they may early learn to acquire a free unembarrassed Countenance, a Gracefulness of Attitude and Deportment, and an easy Manner of de∣livering themselves before Company. Besides, the Performance of these Dramas will be a domestic Recre∣ation and Amusement. The Parents having always some Part to perform in them, will taste the pleasing Delight of partaking in the Diversions of their young Family; and from the Gratitude of the latter, and the Satisfaction of the Parent, both will be mutually
<PB N="ix" REF="9"/>attached to each other by a Bond of additional Tender∣ness.</P>
<P>Independent of the moral Utility of this Work, with Respect to Children, it is obvious that there cannot be a more proper one to instruct them early in delivering their native Language with Ease and Propriety. The greater Part of those Books which are first put into their Hands, are either above their Comprehension, or totally remote from their Ideas and Sentiments. All the Objects, on the contrary, here held up to their View, being of a Nature sufficiently interesting to excite their Curiosity, they will of course take Pleasure in the easy Study of a Work, which may render them familiar to the innocent Turn of Thought and Expression adapted to their Age, and applied to describe their Amusements, their Pursuits, and their Necessities.</P>

<HEAD>THE LITTLE BROTHER.</HEAD>
<P>FANNY arose one morning very early, intending to go and gather some flowers in the garden, and to make a nosegay of them to carry to her mama, who was then in bed. As she was just preparing to go down stairs, Mr. Glassford her father entered her chamber smiling, and took her up in his arms, saying, "Good morning, my dear Fanny! come along with me directly; I am going to shew you something which you will cer∣tainly be very glad to see." Fanny eagerly asked, "What is it, papa?" "God has given you a little brother last night," answered he. "A little brother? Ah! where is he? Let me see him! Pray carry me to him directly!" Her father opened the door of the chamber in which her mother lay. There was beside the bed a strange woman whom Fanny had never before seen in the house, and who was wrapping up the new-born infant in its swathes. Fanny asked a thousand questions, to which her father answered as well as he was able; and thought he had satisfied her curiosity in every thing, when she said to him, "Papa, who is that old woman? how she binds my little brother up! Are not you afraid that she will hurt him?"</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, no; never fear. It is an honest woman that I have sent for to take care of him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>But he belongs to mama. Has she seen him yet?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(drawing back the curtain of her bed.)</STAGE> Yes, Fanny, I have seen him. Tell me, are not you glad to see him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, indeed I am, mama. You have given me a very pretty young companion! what a cunning little face he has! and all red, as if he had just been running. Papa, will you let him play with me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is not possible, my dear, he cannot stand upon his little legs. You see how weak they are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh dear! the little legs! I see it will be a long time before we shall run about together.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>All in good time. He must first learn to walk; and then you will soon be able to play and jump together in the garden.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shall we? O my poor little fellow! I must give you something to make you fond of me. Hold; I have a little picture in my pocket. There, take that. What is the matter, papa? the little monkey will not have it. He holds his little fists shut.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>He does not know how to use them yet. We must wait a few months.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is that the case? aha! my little man, I will give you all my play-things. Well! are you glad of that? answer me. He seems to smile. Call me Fanny! What, wont you speak?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>He will not be able to speak these two years. But Fanny, take care that you do not disturb your mama with too much talk.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! papa, look there, his face is quite changed; see, he cries; certainly it is because he is hungry. Be quiet then, my little man, and I will go get you something nice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not trouble yourself, my dear, about his victuals. He has no teeth yet. How should he be able to eat?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Cannot he eat? What will he live upon then? Must he die?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>No my child. God has given me milk in my breast for the nourishment of thy little brother. He is very weak as yet; but after some time you shall see how he will tumble about on the floor, like a little lamb.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>How I long to see that! But only look what a pretty tiny head! I dare not touch it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="14"/>
<SPEAKER>Mr. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may touch it; but very gently.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! quite gently. Oh dear! how soft it is! like a ball of cotton.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every little child has such a head as your bro∣ther.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>If he was to fall he would break it all to pieces.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly. But we will take good care to hold him, so that he shall not fall.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you know, Fanny, that five years ago you were as little as he?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>As little as he! Oh, papa, you are joking.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my dear; nothing is more true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet I do not remember it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I believe. Do you remember when I had this carpet put on the floor?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why it has always been as it is now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all. I had this carpet laid down at the very time when you were as little as your brother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! then I never took notice of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Little babies never take notice of what passes where the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are. When your brother shall be as old as you, ask him if he remembers that you tried this day to make him learn to pronounce your name. You will then see if he recollects it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, and did I suck at mama's breast too?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly. If you knew all the pains that she has taken for you! In the first place you were so weak that you could scarce take any nourishment. We were afraid every moment that you would die before our faces. Your mother used to say, My poor infant! if she should fall into a fit! and believe me she took infinite pains to get you to suck a few drops of milk.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, dear mama! it was you then that taught me to feed myself?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my child. Then after your mother had succeeded in making you take to the breast of yourself, you grew fat and good-humoured. Such were her cares for near two years, every day and every hour of the day. Sometimes, when your mother was fallen asleep merely through fatigue, you would disturb her rest by your cries. Then would she be obliged to rise and run to your cradle. My dear Fanny, would she say, while she endeavoured to
<PB N="4" REF="15"/>quiet you, surely thou must be thirsty, and then she would take you to her breast.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>And was my head at that time as soft as my brother's?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Just the same, my dear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>What mine! that is so hard now? Oh dear, I must have broken it a thousand times.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! child; we took so much care of you. Your mother for a time renounced every pleasure, and kept from all company, on purpose not to lose you a mo∣ment from her sight. As often as business, that was abso∣lutely indispensable, obliged her to go out, she was in con∣tinual apprehension for you. My dear Grace, she would say to your nurse, I give Fanny into your care, to look to her as if it were your own child; and she was continually making the good woman presents, to induce her to take more particular care of you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! my dear good mama!—But was there ever a time, papa, when I could not run? I that can run so well now. See; in three or four steps I am across the room. Who was it that taught me this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thy mother and I. We put a bandage of vel∣vet well stuffed about your head, that if you happened to fall you might not hurt yourself. We then held you by leading-strings to assist your first attempts in walking, and every day we went into the garden upon the grass-plat, where placing ourselves opposite to each other, at a little distance, we set you down betwixt us, standing all alone, and held out our arms to invite you to come sometimes to one, sometimes to the other. Your slightest stumble would make our blood run cold. It was by often repeat∣ing these trials that we taught you to walk.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>I could never have thought that I gave you so much trouble. Was it you too that taught me to speak?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; for that again you are indebted to us. I used to take you upon my knees, and repeat to you the words papa and mama, until you were able to lisp them to me again. Every word that you can speak this day we taught you in the same manner. I dare say you can re∣collect that it was we also who shewed you how to read.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! I remember that perfectly. You had me placed every day at dinner between you; and at the dessert, a plate of raisins was set upon the table, and some small
<PB N="5" REF="16"/>squares marked with the letters. Whenever I was so lucky as to name them perfectly, you always gave me some rai∣sins. Oh! it was a very pretty play.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>If we had not taken all these pains with you, if we had left you to yourself, what would have become of you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should have been dead a long time ago. Ah, the dear good papa and mama!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet you sometimes vex your papa; you are sometimes disobedient to mama!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will never be so any more as long as I live. I did not know how much you had done for me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Take notice of the attention that we shall pay to your little brother, and then say to yourself, "I too have given my parents the same trouble."</P>
<P>This conversation made a lively impression upon Fanny; and when she saw all the tenderness which her mother testified for her little brother; all the anxiety that she felt for his health; the patience which she exerted in en∣deavouring to make him take to his nourishment; how much she was afflicted whenever she heard him cry; with what tender solicitude her father relieved her of some part of her fatigue, and how both one and the other took infi∣nite pains in teaching the infant to walk and speak; she would say in her own mind, My dear parents have taken the same trouble with me. This reflexion inspired her with so much affection and gratitude towards them, that she ever after faithfully observed the promise which she had made, never voluntarily to cause them the slightest uneasiness.</P>

<HEAD>THE FOUR SEASONS.</HEAD>
<P>AH! if it would always continue to be winter! said young Florio, who was just returned from sliding, and was amusing himself in the garden with making men of snow. Mr. Gardener his father, hearing these words, said to him, My dear, thou wilt do me a pleasure to write down that wish on my tablets. Florio complied, and wrote while his hand trembled with cold. The win∣ter passed away, and spring succeeded. Florio was walk∣ing
<PB N="6" REF="17"/>along with his father beside a border in the garden, where the hyacinth, auricula and narcissus were in perfect bloom. He felt the most lively pleasure in breathing their perfume, and admiring their fresh and vivid colours. These are the productions of Spring, said Mr. Gardener to him. They are beautiful, but of very short duration. Oh! replied Florio, that it were always Spring! Be so good as to write that wish in my tablets. Florio obeyed while his heart beat with joy. The Spring very soon made room for Summer. Florio, one fine day, went out to take a walk with his parents and some of his young acquaintance to a neighbouring village. Their walk afforded them a prospect sometimes of green corn fields, waving smoothly like a calm sea lightly agitated by the breeze; and sometimes of meadows enamelled with a thousand flowers. On every side they beheld young lambs at play, and the high spirited colts and fillies sporting round their dams. They eat cherries, strawberries, and other fruits of the season, and passed the whole day in amusing themselves in the fields. Do not you think, Florio, said Mr. Gardener as they were returning to town, that the Summer too hath its pleasures! Oh! replied he, I wish it would last all the year; and at the request of his father he wrote down this wish too on his tablets. At length the Autumn arrived. All the family went to spend a day in the country, at harvest time. The weather was not quite so hot as in Summer; the air was mild, and the sky clear. The gardens and orchards were loaded with fruits. The round plump melons from their rich beds diffused a delicious odour; and the branches of the pear∣trees bent under the weight of the finest pears. This was a day of feasting for Florio, who loved nothing so much as grapes, melons and peaches; and he had the additional pleasure of gathering them himself. This fine season, said his father to him, will soon pass away. Winter is advancing towards us very fast, to deprive us of the Autumn. Ah! answered Florio, I wish it would stop short in its approach, and Autumn never leave us.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Gard.</SPEAKER>
<P>Should you be glad of that, Florio?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Florio.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! very glad, papa, I promise you.</P>
<P>But, replied his father, taking out his tablets, cast your eye a little on what is written here. Read it out!</P>

<P>This is something particular. In the Win∣ter, you desired that it might be always Winter; in the Spring, that it might always be Spring; in Summer, that that season would always continue; and now, in Autumn, you wish that it may always be Autumn. Do you reflect what conclusion may be drawn from all this?</P>

<SPEAKER>Florio.</SPEAKER>
<P>That all the seasons of the year are good.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Gard.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my son, they are all blest with plen∣teous increase, and variety of pleasures: and God knows much better how to govern the system of nature than we, limited beings as we are. If it had depended only on thee last Winter, we should never have had any more Spring, nor Summer, nor Autumn. Thou wouldest have covered the earth with eternal snows, and never felt any other pleasure than that of sliding, or making men of snow. Of how many other enjoyments wouldest thou not have been deprived by such a disposition of things! we are happy that it is not in our power to regulate the course of nature. Every thing would be lost which was intended for our happiness, if our own rash vows were heard.</P>

<HEAD>THE SNOW.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER many deceitful promises of its return, Spring at length arrived. A gentle breeze warmed the air. The snow was seen to melt, the fields to resume their ver∣dure, and the flowers to bud forth. The singing of birds was heard on every side. Little Louisa was already gone
<PB N="8" REF="19"/>out to the country with her father. She had heard the first songs of the blackbird and the linnet, and she had gathered some of the earliest violets. But the weather changed once more. There arose suddenly a violent north∣wind, that whistled through the groves, and covered the roads with snow. Little Louisa went to bed that night shivering with cold, and blessed God for having given her so comfortable a shelter from the inclemency of the air. Ah! what a sight when she arose the next morning! Every thing was perfectly white. There had fallen du∣ring the night so great a quantity of snow, that it was knee-deep in the roads. This made Louisa quite dull. The little birds appeared still more so. The ground being every where covered to a great depth, they were not able to find the least grain or worm to appease their hunger. All the feathered inhabitants of the grove took refuge in the towns and villages, to seek the relief of man. Nu∣merous flights of sparrows, linnets, chaffinches and larks, alighted in the streets and court-yards of houses, and scraped with their claws and bills into every heap of rub∣bish, to find if possible some nourishment. There came near fifty of these guests into the yard of the house where Louisa was. She saw them, and returned quite afflicted into her father's chamber. What is the matter, my dear? said he. Ah! papa, answered she, there they are, all in the yard. The poor little birds that sung so chearfully only two days ago. They seem to be quite starved with cold, and to ask for something to eat. Will you let me give them a little corn? With the greatest pleasure, said her father. The barn was on the other side of the way: thither she ran, accompanied by her governess, to get a few handfuls of corn and hemp-seed, and came imme∣diately back to scatter it in the yard. The little birds approached, fluttering about her in great numbers, and picking up every grain. Louisa amused herself in look∣ing at them, and was quite delighted with the sight. She went to ask her papa and mama to come and view them also, and to partake of her satisfaction. But these hand∣fuls of grain were soon picked up. The birds then flew up to the house-top, and seemed to eye Louisa wistfully, as if they would have said, "Hast thou nothing more to give us?" Louisa understood their language. She flies like lightning to seek more grain. In crossing the way
<PB N="9" REF="20"/>she met a little boy, who had not a heart quite so compas∣sionate as hers. He was carrying in his hand a cage full of birds, and was shaking it so carelessly that the poor little creatures were thrown every moment with their heads against the wires. This sight gave Louisa pain. What are you going to do with those birds? said she to the little boy. I do not know yet, answered he. I am trying to sell them, and if nobody will buy them I shall feast my cat upon them at home. Your cat! replied Louisa: Your cat? Oh! what an ill-natured boy! As to that, they would not be the first that she has munched alive. So, dangling his cage as before, he was setting off at a great pace, when Louisa called him back, and asked how much he would have for his birds? I will sell them, said he, three for a penny, and there are eighteen of them. Well then, said Louisa, they are mine. So bidding the little boy to follow her, she ran to her papa, and asked his permission to purchase those birds. Her father granted it with plea∣sure, and even gave his daughter an empty room for the reception of her little guests. Jack (that was the name of the ill-natured boy) went away very well satisfied with his bargain, and told all his companions that he knew a little miss who would buy birds. In a few hours there came so many little country boys to Louisa's door that one would have thought it the entrance to a market. They all crouded round her, climbing upon each other, and holding up their cages with both hands, each hoping to obtain the preference for his birds. Louisa purchased all that were brought before her, and had them carried into the chamber where the first were. Night came. It was a long time since Louisa had gone to bed so well pleased in her mind. Am not I very happy, said she to herself, in being able to save the lives of so many inno∣cent creatures, and to give them food? When Summer comes, I will go into the fields and groves, and all my little guests will sing their sweetest songs to thank me for the care that I have taken of them. With this reflexion she went to sleep, and dreamed that she was in a grove of trees of the finest verdure, which were all covered with birds chirping as they fluttered from bough to bough, or engaged in seeding their young ones. The happy Louisa smiled in her sleep. She rose very early to go and feed her little friends in the aviary and in the yard: but she
<PB N="10" REF="21"/>was not now so happy as she had been the day before. She knew how much money she had put into her purse, and that there could not remain much of it by this time. If this snowy weather should last some few days longer, said she, what will become of the other birds? The wicked little boys will give them alive, as they are, to their cats! and for want of a small sum of money I shall not be able to save them. Full of these sorrowful ideas she draws her purse out slowly in order to count her little trea∣sure once more; but how great is her astonishment to feel her purse heavy! She opens it and finds it full of pieces of coin, of every sort indiscriminately, up to the very strings. She runs immediately to her father, and relates the incident to him with transports of pleasure and sur∣prise. Her father took her to his bosom, kissed her, and shed tears of joy upon the cheeks of Louisa. My dear child, said he, thou hast never made me so happy as in this moment. Continue to relieve the little creatures that thou shalt see in distress, and in proportion as thy purse is diminished, thou shalt find it filled again. What joy∣ful news for Louisa! She ran immediately to her aviary, with her apron-full of hemp-seed and corn. All the birds came fluttering round her, and looked with eager eyes for their breakfast. After feeding them, she next went down into the yard, and bestowed a plentiful meal upon the famished birds that were there. She saw herself now en∣gaged in the support of almost an hundred dependents. This afforded her such a pleasure! Her dolls and play∣things never had given her half so much. In the after∣noon, as she put her hand into the bag of hemp-seed, she found a note with these words: <HI>The inhabitants of the air fly towards thee, O Lord! and thou givest them their food; thou openest thy hand, and fillest all things living with plen∣teousness.</HI> Her father had followed her. She turned to him, and said, I am now therefore like God. The in∣habitants of the air fly towards me, and when I open my hand, I fill them with plenteousness. Yes, my dear, said her father, every time that thou doest good to any crea∣ture, thou art like God. When grown up thou shalt assist thy fellow-creatures as thou now dost the birds, and thou shalt then resemble God much more. Ah, what happiness for a mortal to be able to act like God! Du∣ring a week, Louisa continued to extend her bounty, and
<PB N="11" REF="22"/>feed every thing that was hungry about her. At length the snow melted, the fields resumed their verdure, and the birds, which before had not dared to quit the neigh∣bourhood of the houses, now turned their flight toward the grove. But those that had been put into the aviary remained there confined: they saw the sun, flew up against the window, pecked at the glass, but in vain; their pri∣son was too strong for them. Louisa could not as yet imagine what made them so uneasy. One day, as she was taking them their food, her father entered a few moments after her. She was very happy to see that he was desirous of being witness to her pleasure. My dear Louisa, said he, why do these birds seem so uneasy? I should imagine that they want something. May not they, perhaps, have left in the fields companions whom they would now be glad to see again? You are right, papa; they seem to be dull ever since the return of the fine weather. I will go and open the window, and let them fly away. I think thou wouldest not do amiss, replied her father. Thou wilt diffuse joy through all the country. These little prisoners will go to find their friends once more, and will fly to meet them, as thou dost to meet me when I have been absent some time from home. Before he had finished speaking, the windows were all thrown up: the birds perceived it, and in two minutes there did not remain a single one of them in the room. Some were seen to skim along the ground; others to soar up into the air; some to perch upon the neighbouring trees, and others to fly backwards and forwards before the windows with chirpings of joy. Louisa went every day to walk in the fields. She saw and heard numbers of birds on every side. At one time a lark would rise up before her feet, and sing its sprightly strain while it mounted to the clouds. At another time a linnet, perched upon the highest branches of a tree, chirped forth its song. And whenever she observed any one to distinguish itself by the sweetness of its music, Louisa would say, There is one of my little guests: one may know by its voice that it has been well fed last Winter.</P>

<HEAD>ARTHUR.</HEAD>
<P>A Poor labourer, of the name of Bernard, had six young children, and found himself much at a loss to main∣tain them. As an addition to his misfortune, the season happened to be unfavorable, and consequently bread much dearer than the year before. Bernard worked day and night, yet in spite of his labours could not possibly earn money enough to provide food (even of the most indifferent sort) for six hungry children. He was reduced to extremity. Calling therefore one day his little family together, with tears in his eyes he said to them, My dear children, bread is risen so dear that with all my labour I am not able to earn sufficient for your subsistence. You see how I am circumstanced. This piece of bread in my hand must be paid for with the wages of my whole day's labour, and therefore you must be content to share with me the little that I have been able to earn. There certainly will not be sufficient to satisfy you all; but at least there will be enough to prevent your perishing with hunger. The poor man could say no more: he lifted up his eyes to heaven, and wept. His children wept also, and each one said within himself, O Lord, come to our assistance, unfortunate infants that we are! Help our dear father, and suffer us not to perish for want! Bernard divided the bread into seven equal shares: he kept one for himself, and distributed the rest amongst his children. But one of them, named Arthur, refused to take his por∣tion, and said, I cannot eat any thing, father; I find myself sick. Do you take my part, or divide it amongst the rest. My poor child! what is the matter with thee? said Bernard, taking him up in his arms. I am sick, answered Arthur; very sick. I would go to bed. Ber∣nard carried him to bed, and the next morning, over∣whelmed with sorrow, he went to a physician, and be∣sought him for charity to come and see his sick child, and to assist him. The physician, who was a man of great humanity, went to Bernard's house, though he was very sure of not being paid for his visits. He approached Arthur's bed, felt his pulse, but could not thereby discover any symptom of illness. He found him, however, very weak,
<PB N="13" REF="24"/>and, in order to raise his spirits, was going to prescribe a cordial draught; but Arthur said, Do not order any thing for me, sir! I could take nothing that you should prescribe for me.</P>

</SP>
<SP>

<P>It may be so: however, I shall not press you; but I will go and ask the reason from your father, who will perhaps not be so mysterious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! I beseech you, do not let my father know any thing of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Thou art a very unaccountable child! but I must certainly acquaint your father with this, since you will not confess the truth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arth.</SPEAKER>
<P>O dear! by no means, sir: I will rather explain every thing to you myself. But first I beg that my bro∣thers and sisters may quit the room.</P>
<P>The physician ordered the children to withdraw, and then Arthur continued: Alas! sir, in this hard season, my father can scarcely earn us every day a loaf of coarse bread. He divides it amongst us. Each of us can have but a small part, and he will hardly take any for himself. It makes me unhappy to see my little brothers and sisters suffer hunger. I am the eldest, and have more strength than they; I like better, therefore, not to eat any, that they may divide my share amongst them. This is the reason why I pretended that I was sick, and could not eat; but I entreat you not to let my father know this!</P>
<P>The physician wiped his eyes, and said, But, my dear little friend, art thou not hungry?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, sir, I am hungry, sure enough; but that does not give me so much pain as to see my family suffer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phys.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you will soon die if you take no nourish∣ment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arth.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sensible of that; but I shall die contented. My father will have one mouth less to feed; and when I shall be with God, I will pray him to give bread to my little brothers and sisters.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="25"/>The humane physician was melted with pity and admi∣ration on hearing the generous child speak thus. Taking him up in his arms, he clasped him to his heart, and said, No, my dear little friend, thou shalt not die! God, who is the father of us all, will take care of thee and of thy family. Return him thanks that he hath led me hither. I shall come back very soon. He hastened therefore to his own house, and ordering one of his ser∣vants to take a quantity of provisions of all sorts, re∣turned with him immediately to Arthur and his famished little brothers. He made them all sit down at table, and eat heartily, until they were satisfied. It was a de∣lightful sight for the good physician, to behold the joy of those innocent creatures. On his departure, he bid Arthur not to be under any concern, for that he would provide for their necessities; which promise he faithfully observed, and furnished them every day with a plentiful subsistence. Other charitable persons also, to whom he related the circumstance, imitated his generosity. Some sent them provisions, some money, and others clothes and linen, insomuch that very few days passed before this little family had more of every thing than was sufficient for their wants.</P>
<P>As soon as Bernard's landlord was informed of what the generous little Arthur had suffered for his father and his brothers, filled with admiration at such nobleness of soul, he sent for Bernard, and addressed him thus: You have an admirable son; permit me to be his father also. I will allow you an annuity out of my own pocket, and Arthur, with all your other children, shall be maintained at my expence, in whatever professions they shall chuse. If they make use of this establishment to their own advantage, I will charge myself with the care of their fortunes.</P>
<P>Bernard returned to his house transported with joy, and throwing himself on his knees, blessed God for having given him so worthy a child.</P>

<P>MRS. P—, a young married lady, as much dis∣tinguished for the elegant charms of her wit, as for the delicacy of her sentiments, and the respectability of her character, was one day reproving Pamela, her eldest daughter, for a slight fault very pardonable at her age. Pamela, touched with the tender manner in which her mother delivered the reproof, shed tears of sorrow and affection. Caroline, who was then but three years old, seeing her sister weep, climbs up the steps of her chair, in order to reach her; with one hand she takes her handker∣chief, and wipes her sister's eyes, and with the other slips into her mouth a piece of sweetmeat from her own. I think, an able painter might make a charming picture on this subject.</P>

So I, silly fool that I was—I should have remembered the cake; but I thought no more of that, I was so overjoyed to carry home so much money to my father. Besides I had not counted it, and was de∣sirous to know the sum. So I laid my fiddle down on the ground beside me, and took out the handkerchief. See here, said I to him, what I got more than was promised me at first; one of the young misses gave it me. I had tied up all my money in the handkerchief, and was going to undo the knot, when the snatched at it. I guessed his roguery. So he pulled one way and I another, when all at once, seeing where my fiddle lay on the ground, he stamped on it with both his feet.

<P>Yes, that is true, papa; and if I had not been very good-natured, I should have got a constable to put him in bridewell. You shall hear, sir. When I saw him go out, I said to myself, I must give this poor creature
<PB N="33" REF="44"/>something too for his trouble, for I know that Godfrey has nothing of his own, and a beggar is but ill paid with only a morsel of cake. So I took some money out of my purse which I gave him, and he drew out a handkerchief to put it in. I perceived that it was one of my sister's handkerchiefs; you may see the mark. I begged him very civilly to return it, which he would not. So I took him by the collar, and we struggled together, and by accident I put my foot upon his fiddle.</P>

<HEAD>THE CANARY-BIRD.</HEAD>
<P>CANARY-BIRDS to sell! Who'll buy my Canary∣birds? Fine Canary-birds! Thus cried a man passing by the house of little Jessy. Jessy heard him: she ran to the window, and looking into the street, saw that it was a bird-seller who carried upon his head a large cage full of Canary-birds. They jumped so nimbly from perch to perch, and chirped so sweetly, that Jessy, in the eagerness of her curiosity, was near falling out of the window, while she endeavoured to have a nearer view of them. Will you buy a Canary-bird, miss? said the birdman to her. Perhaps I may, answered Jessy; but that does not depend on me entirely. Stop a little; I will go and ask my papa's leave. The man promised to stop, and seeing a bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k on the other side of the street, laid down his cage these and stood by the side of it. Jessy in the mean time

<SP>

<P>Ah! I am afraid—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jessy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of what, papa?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Gower.</SPEAKER>
<P>That you will let him die of hunger or thirst.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jessy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I let him die of hunger or thirst? Oh! no, cer∣tainly I sha'nt. Nay, I will never touch my own break∣fast, before my bird has had his.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Gower.</SPEAKER>
<P>Jessy! Jessy! you know you are very giddy! and then you have only to neglect him one day.</P>
<P>Jessy promised her father so fairly; she coaxed him so much, and pulled his coat-skirt so often, that Mr. Gower consented at last to his daughter's request. He crossed the street, leading her by the hand; and when they came up to the cage, they chose the prettiest Canary-bird in it; a male, of the most lively yellow, with a little black tuft upon his head. Who was ever so happy as Jessy then? She held her purse to her father, that he might pay for the bird. Mr. Gower then took money out of his own, to buy a handsome cage with drawers, and a water-cup of crystal. Jessy had no sooner given the Canary-bird possession of its little palace, than she ran to every part of the house, calling her mama, her sisters and all the servants, and shewing them the bird which her father had been so good as to buy her. When any of her little friends came to see her, the first words were, do you know I have the prettiest Canary Bird in the world? he is as yellow as gold, and has a little black crest like the plumes of mama's hat. Come, I will shew him to you; his name is Cherry. Cherry was quite happy under
<PB N="36" REF="47"/>Jessy's care. The first thing that she thought of in the morning was to give him fresh grain and the clearest wa∣ter. Whenever there was any cake at table, Cherry had his part of it first. She had always some bits of sugar in store for him, and his cage was garnished with fresh greens of one sort or another. Cherry was not ungrateful to all these attentions. He soon learned to distinguish Jessy; and the moment he heard her step in the room, what flut∣tering of his wings! what incessant chirpings! Jessy al∣most devoured him with kisses. At the end of a week he began to sing, and produced the most delightful music. Sometimes he swelled his little notes to such a length, that one would have thought he must expire from fatigue; then, after pausing a moment, he would begin again sweeter than ever, with a tone so clear and brilliant that he could be heard all over the house. Jessy passed whole hours in listening to him as she sat by his cage. She some∣times would let her work fall out of her hands to gaze at him, and, after he had entertained her with a sweet song, she regaled him in her turn with a tune upon the bird∣organ which he would endeavour to imitate. These plea∣sures, however, became familiar to Jessy. Her father, one day, made her a present of a book of prints. She was so agreeably taken up with it that Cherry was something the less minded. He would chirp the moment that he saw Jessy, though ever so far off; but Jessy heard him not. Almost a week had passed since he had either had fresh greens or biscuit. He repeated the sweetest airs that Jessy had taught him, and composed new for her, but in vain. The truth was, Jessy's thoughts were otherwise engaged. Her birth-day came on, when her godfather gave her a great jointed doll. This doll, which she called Colum∣bine, completely banished all thoughts of Cherry. From morning till night she was busied with nothing but dres∣sing and undressing Miss Columbine a hundred times, talking to her, and carrying her up and down the room. The poor bird was very happy to get some food towards evening. Sometimes it happened that he was obliged to wait for it till the next day. At length, one day when Mr. Gower was at table, and cast his eye accidentally upon the cage, he saw the Canary-bird lying upon its breast and panting for breath. Its feathers were ruffled, and it seemed contracted all of a lump. Mr. Gower
<PB N="37" REF="48"/>went close up to it; but no more fond chirpings! The poor little creature had scarce strength enough left to breathe. Jessy, cried Mr. Gower, what is the matter with your Canary-bird? Jessy blushed. Why, papa, I — somehow, I forgot;—and all in a tremble she ran to fetch the box of seed. Mr. Gower took down the cage, and examined the drawer and the water-cup. Alas! Cherry had not a single grain, nor a drop of water. Ah! poor bird! cried Mr. Gower; thou art fallen into cruel hands! If I had foreseen this, I should never have bought thee. All the company rose from table, holding up their hands, and crying, The poor bird! Mr. Gower put some seed into the drawer, and filled the cup with fresh water, but had much difficulty in bringing Cherry back to life. Jessy left the table, and went up into her cham∣ber, crying, and made her handkerchief quite wet with her tears. The next day Mr. Gower ordered the bird to be carried out of the house, and given as a present to the son of Mr. Mercer, his neighbour, who was counted a very careful boy, and would pay more attention to him than Jessy had done. But, to hear the little girl's com∣plaints and expressions of sorrow! Ah! my dear bird! my poor Cherry! Indeed I promise you faithfully, papa, that I will never forget him a single moment as long as I live. Only leave him with me this once. Mr. Gower suffered himself at length to be touched with Jessy's en∣treaties, and gave her back the Canary-bird, but not without a severe reprimand for her negligence, and the strictest injunction as to the future. This poor little crea∣ture, says he, is shut up, and therefore not able to pro∣vide for its own wants. Whenever you want any thing, you can ask for it; but Cherry cannot make people un∣derstand his language. If ever you let him suffer hunger or thirst again— At these words Jessy shed a flood of tears. She took her papa's hand and kissed it, but her grief was so full that she could not utter a word. Now Jessy was once more mistress of Cherry, and Cherry was sincerely reconciled with Jessy. About a month after, Mr. Gower was obliged to go into the country for a few days with his lady. Jessy, Jessy, said he, in parting with his daughter, I earnestly recommend poor Cherry to your care. Her parents were scarcely got into the carriage, when Jessy ran to the cage, and carefully provided the
<PB N="38" REF="49"/>bird with every thing necessary. In a few hours after, her time began to hang heavy. She sent for some of her little acquaintance, and soon recovered her chearfulness. They went out to walk together, and at their return spent part of the evening in playing at blind-man's buff and four corners. After that they danced. In fine, the little company broke up very late, and Jessy went to bed quite fatigued. The next morning she awoke by break of day, and began thinking on the amusements of the evening before. If her governess had let her, she would have run as soon as she got up, to see the Miss Marshalls, but was obliged to wait till after dinner. However, she had scarcely finished it, before she desired to be conducted to their house: and Cherry!—he was obliged to stay at home alone, and to fast. The following day was also spent in amusements: and Cherry!—he was forgotten again. It was the same the third day: and Cherry!—who could think of him in the midst of such diversions? The fourth day, Mr. and Mrs. Gower returned from the country. Jessy had thought very little about their return. Her father had scarce kissed her and enquired after her health, before he asked, How is Cherry? Very well, cried Jessy, a little confused; and she ran towards the cage to carry him some water. Alas! the poor little creature was no more. He was laid upon his back, with his wings spread and his bill open. Jessy screamed out and wrung her hands. Every one in the house ran up, and was eye-witness of the disaster. Ah! poor bird! cried Mr. Gower; how painful has thy death been! If I had wrung thy head off the day that I went to the country, thou wouldest have had but the pain of a mo∣ment, whereas now thou hast endured for several days the pangs of hunger and thirst, and hast died in a long and cruel agony. However, thou art still happy in being delivered from the hands of so pitiless a guardian. Jessy would have hid herself in the bowels of the earth: she would have given all her play-things, and all her pocket∣money, to purchase the life of Cherry; but it was then too late. Mr. Gower took the bird, and had its skin stuffed and hung up from the ceiling. Jessy did not dare to look at it: her eyes were filled with tears whenever she chanced to perceive it, and every day she entreated her father to remove it from her sight. Mr. Gower did not
<PB N="39" REF="50"/>consent, till after many supplications on her part; and whenever Jessy shewed any mark of inattention or giddi∣ness, the bird was hung up again in its place, and every body would say in her hearing, Poor Cherry! what a cruel death you suffered!</P>

<P>Ah! you are jesting, papa.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Orpin.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I speak quite seriously. To-morrow, neither your mother, nor I, nor in short any body in the house, shall oppose your inclinations.</P>

<SPEAKER>Cam.</SPEAKER>
<P>What pleasure shall we feel to have our necks out of the yoke!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Orpin.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is not all. I do not intend to give you this privilege for to-morrow only: it shall continue until you come of yourselves and request me to assume my authority again.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Orpin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I shall be glad to see you able to conduct yourselves: so prepare to become great folks to∣morrow.</P>
<P>The next day came. The two children, instead of rising at seven o'clock as usual, lay in bed till near nine. Too much sleep makes us heavy and listless. This was
<PB N="40" REF="51"/>the case with Camillus and Julia. They awoke at length uncalled, and got up in an ill-humour. However, they pleased themselves a little with the agreeable idea of act∣ing in whatever manner they liked the whole day. Come, what shall we do first? said Camillus to his sister, after they had dressed themselves and breakfasted.</P>

<P>Why, we'll go and play.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, at crafts, or at fox and geese.</P>

<P>You know I cannot bear those games that oblige one to sit still.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, then mention some to your own liking.</P>

<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, that is pretty play for a little girl!</P>

<P>We'll play then, if you like, at horses. You shall be the horse, and I will be coachman.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>On, yes! to lash me with your whip as you did t'other day. I have not forgot that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cam.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never do it willingly; but the thing is, you won't gallop.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but that hurts me: so I won't play at any such game.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cam.</SPEAKER>
<P>You won't? won't you? Well! let us play at hounds and hare. I will be the huntsman, and you shall be the hare. Come, make ready; I shall set off.</P>

<P>Pshaw! I'll have none of your hunting. You do nothing but tread upon my neels, and punch me in the sides.</P>

<P>Well, since you do not chuse any of my games, I'll never p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay with you again. Do you hear that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor I with you. Do you hear that too?</P>
<P>At these words they quitted the middle of the room, where they were standing, and retired each into a corner, and there remained a considerable time without looking at or speaking to each other. They were still in a pout, when the clock struck ten. The forenoon would soon pass <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; therefore Camillus at length approaching his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> said, "I must do every thing that you like.

<PB N="41" REF="52"/>then, I will play at drafts with you for twelve chesnuts a game."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have no chesnuts: and besides you know you owe me a dozen already. You should pay me those first.</P>

<P>Yes, I owed them to you yesterday; but I do not owe any thing to-day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray how did you come to be quit?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cam.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nobody has a right to ask any thing of those who are their own masters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well! I shall tell my papa of your cheat∣ing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cam.</SPEAKER>
<P>But papa has no power over me now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>If that be the case, I won't play.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cam.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you may do as you like.</P>
<P>They go away pouting again to the farther ends of the room from each other. Camillus began to whistle, Julia to sing. Camillus tied knots on his whip, and cracked it: Julia dressed her doll, and began a conversation with it. Camillus grumbled, and Julia sighed. The clock struck again. They had another hour less to play in. Camillus, in a pet, threw his whip out of the window: Julia tossed her doll into a corner. They look at each other, not knowing what to say. At length Julia breaks silence: "Come, Camillus, I will be your horse."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cam.</SPEAKER>
<P>There now, that is right! I have a long string for the bridle. See here. Put it into your mouth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, not into my mouth. Tie it round my waist, or fasten it to my arm.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cam.</SPEAKER>
<P>How you talk! Did you ever see horses have the bit any where but between their teeth?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I am not a real horse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cam.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but you should do just the same as if you were.</P>

<P>I do not see any occasion for that.</P>

<P>I suppose you think that you know more about it than I do, who am all the day in the stable. Come, take it the right way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have been trailing it about in the dirt all the week. No, I'll never put it into my mouth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cam.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I won't have it any where else. I would rather not play at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Just as you like!</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="53"/>A third fit of pouting, more sullen and peevish than before. Camillus goes for his whip: Julia takes up her doll. But the whip refuses to crack: the doll's dressing goes all wrong. Camillus sighs, Julia weeps. This in∣terval brought on dinner-hour; and Mr. Orpin came to ask them, if they chose to have it served up. But what is the matter with you? said he, seeing them both quite dull. Nothing, papa, answered the children, and wiping their eyes, followed their father into the dining∣room. The dinner this day consisted of a number of dishes, and a bottle of wine was opened for each of the children. My dear children, said Mr. Orpin, if I had still my former authority over you, I would forbid you to taste all these dishes, and particularly to drink wine. At least, I would desire you to be very sparing of them, be∣cause I know how dangerous wine and high-feasoned food are to children. But ye are now your own masters, and may eat and drink whatever ye fancy. The children did not wait to be told this twice. The one swallowed great bits of meat without bread; the other took sauce in whole spoonfuls: and they drank full bumpers of wine, without remembering to mix water with it. My dear, whispered Mrs. Orpin to her husband, they will make themselves sick. I fear they will, my dear, answered Mr. Orpin; but I would rather that they should learn for once at their own expence how much one may suffer from ignorance, than by a premature attention deprive them of the fruits of so important a lesson. Mrs. Orpin saw her husband's intention, and therefore suffered our thoughtless little couple to indulge their greediness. The cloth was now removed. The children had stuffed as long as they were able, and their little heads began to be heated. Come with me, Julia, cried Camillus, and took his sister with him into the garden. Mr. Orpin thought proper to follow them unobserved. There was a little pond in the garden, and at the edge of the pond a small boat. Camillus had a mind to go into it Julia stopped him. You know, said she, that we must not go there. Must not? answered Camillus. Do you forget that we are our own masters? Oh! that is true, said Julia: so, giving her hand to her brother, they both went into the boat. Mr. Orphin drew nearer to them, but did not chuse to discover himself yet. He knew that
<PB N="43" REF="54"/>the pond was not deep. Even if they fall in, said he to himself, I shall not have much trouble in getting them out. The two children wished to disengage the boat from the bank, and push it out towards the middle of the pond; but they were not able to untie the knots of the rope which held it fast. Since we cannot fail, said the giddy Camillus, we may at least balance ourselves. So, striding across the boat, he began to press it down, first on one side, then on the other. Their heads being a little dizzy, it was not long before their legs failed them. They laid hold of each other to support themselves, and fell both <HI>plump</HI> upon the side of the boat, and from thence into the water. Mr. Orpin flew like lightning from the place where he had been hid. He threw himself into the water, seized his rash children one in each hand, and brought them back into the house, half dead with terror. They felt themselves violently sick while they were un∣dressing and rubbing with cloths. At length they were put each in a warm bed: they fell alternately into a stupor and convulsions: they complained of a dreadful head-ach and pains in the bowels, were seized with frequent faint∣ing fits, and in the intervals with shudderings, sickness of the stomach, and difficulty of breathing. In this deplora∣ble condition they passed the rest of the day: they sobbed and wept, till at length they fell fast asleep through wea∣riness. Early the next morning their father entered their chamber, and asked how they had passed the night. Very ill, answered both in a feeble voice: we could not lie easy in bed, and feel a sickness yet in the head and stomach. Poor children, how I pity you! But, added he a moment after, what will ye do with your liberty to-day? Ye remember that ye enjoy it still. Oh! no, no, answered both eagerly. And why, my little friends? Ye said, the other day, that it was so disagreeable to be subject to the direction of others. We have been well punished for our folly, replied Camillus. And shall take warning for a long time, added Julia.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Orpin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ye will not be your own masters then, any longer?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Camillus.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, papa: we would rather be told by you what to do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>It will be much better for us both.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="44" REF="55"/>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Orpin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Think well of what ye say; for, if I re∣sume my authority, I inform you before-hand, that my very first orders will be disagreeable to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cam.</SPEAKER>
<P>No matter, papa; we are ready to do whatever you shall think proper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Orpin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I have here a yellow powder, called rhubarb. It has an unpleasing taste, but is excellent for those who have hurt their stomachs by excess. Since ye consent to follow my orders, I command you instantly to take this powder. Let me see you obey!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cam.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! yes, yes, papa.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would take it, though it were as bitter as soot.</P>
<P>Mr. Orpin gave them the medicine, and the children, without making, as formerly, any grimaces, endeavoured each to excel the other in taking it with a chearful coun∣tenance. This remedy happily had its effect, and they both recovered very soon. After that, whenever their parents would terrify them with threats of punishment, they would say, We shall let you be your own masters! and the children selt more terror from this threat than many others to whom one should say, I will put you in prison!</P>

<HEAD>THE BUSHES.</HEAD>
<P>ONE fine evening in the month of May, Mr. Ogilby was sitting with Algernon, his son, upon the side of a small hill, from whence he pointed out to him the beau∣ties of nature as they lay before him. The setting sun, in taking his last adieu, seemed to have clothed every thing in a robe of purple. They were roused from this pleasing meditation by the chearful song of a shepherd who was driving back his bleating flock from a neigh∣bouring field. On each side of his road there grew up thorn-bushes which no sheep approached without leaving upon them some part of her fleece. Little Algernon grew quite angry at those robbers. Do you see, papa, cried he, those bushes, how they rob the sheep of their wool? Why did God make those ill-natured brambles? or why do not all men join with one accord to destroy them? If the poor sheep come back this same way again, they will leave the
<PB N="45" REF="56"/>rest of their clothing upon them. But, no; I will rise to-morrow at break of day, and come with my bill-hook, and snip-snap, cut all those briars down to the ground. You shall come with me, papa, and bring a little axe, and the whole shall be finished before breakfast.</P>
<P>We will think of your project, answered Mr. Ogilby. But in the mean time do not be unjustly angry with those bushes. Remember what we do about Lammas.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alger.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do we do then? papa.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ogilby.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have not you seen the shepherds arm them∣selves with great shears, and rob the trembling sheep not of a few locks of wool only, but of their whole fleece?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alger.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is very true, papa, because they want it to make themselves clothes; but those bushes rob them out of mere spite, and without having the least occasion for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ogilby.</SPEAKER>
<P>You don't know what purpose these bits of wool may serve to them; but supposing that they served none, has a person any right to appropriate a thing to himself, merely because he wants it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alger.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I have heard you say, papa, that sheep na∣turally lose their fleeces about that time of the year; then it is much better to take it for our use, than to suffer it to fall off quite useless.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ogilby.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your remark is just. Nature hath given all beasts a clothing, and we are obliged from them to borrow ours, unless we chuse to go quite naked and re∣main exposed to the inclemency of the Winter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alger.</SPEAKER>
<P>But a bush has no occasion for clothing. So you see, papa, we must not give up our design. I shall certainly cut all these thorns down to-morrow. You will come along with me, won't you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ogilby.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart. Come then, now for to-morrow morning by break of day.</P>
<P>Algernon, who thought himself already an hero, merely from the thought of destroying with his little arm this legion of robbers, could hardly sleep, taken up as he was with his victories of the next day. Scarce had the chear∣ful singing of the birds that perched on the trees near his windows announced the return of the dawn, before he hasted to awake his father. Mr. Ogilby, on the other hand, though indifferent as to the fate of the thorn-bushes, yet, pleased with the opportunity of shewing to his son the beauties of the opening day, was no less eager to quit
<PB N="46" REF="57"/>his bed. They dressed themselves hastily, took their in∣struments, and set forward on the expedition. Algernon went before with an air of triumph, and Mr. Ogilby had some difficulty to keep up with him. As they approached the bushes, they saw a number of little birds flying back∣wards and forwards amongst them, and fluttering about the branches. Softly! said Mr. Ogilby to his son. Let us suspend our vengeance for a moment, for fear of dis∣turbing those innocent creatures. Let us go up again to that part of the hill where we sat yesterday evening, and examine what it is that those birds seem to seek so busily. They went up the hill, seated themselves, and looked on. They saw that the birds were employed in carrying away those bits of wool in their beaks, which the bushes had torn from the sheep the evening before. There came multitudes of yellow-hammers, chaffinches, linnets and nightingales, who loaded themselves with this plunder. What is the meaning of that? cried Algernon, quite asto∣nished. It means, replied his father, that Providence takes care of the smallest creatures, and furnishes them with every expedient for their happiness and preservation. You see, the poor birds find here a lining for the habi∣tation which they prepare for their young. They make ready, you see, a very comfortable bed for themselves and their little family. Thus the honest thorn-bush, against which you were so easily provoked yesterday, unites the inhabitants of the air with those of the earth. He takes from the rich his superfluities, to satisfy the wants of the poor. Will you come now, and cut him down? Heaven forbid, cried Algernon. Thou art right, my son, replied Mr. Ogilby. Let him flourish in peace, since he makes so generous a use of his conquests.</P>

<HEAD>JOSEPH.</HEAD>
<P>THERE lived once in Bristol a crazy person whose name was Joseph. He never went out without having five or six wigs on his head at once, and as many muffs upon each of his arms. Though his senses were disordered, he was not mischievous, and must be teazed a long time to be put in a passion. Whenever he walked
<PB N="47" REF="58"/>the streets, a number of troublesome little boys would come out of the houses and follow him, crying, Joseph! Joseph! how do you sell your wigs and your muffs? Some of them were even so ill-natured as to throw stones at him. Though Joseph commonly bore all these insults very quietly, yet he was sometimes so tormented that he would fall into a fury, and take up stones or handfuls of dirt to throw at the rabble of boys. Such a combat as this happened one day before the house of Mr. Denham. The noise drew him to the window, and he beheld with grief his own son Henry engaged in the fray. As soon as he perceived this, he shut down the sash, and went into another chamber. At dinner, Mr. Denham said to his son, Who was that man that you was running and hal∣looing after?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know him very well, papa. It is the crazy man called Joseph.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Denham.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor man! What can have occasioned this misfortune to him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>They say that it was a lawsuit for a great estate. He was so grieved at losing it that he has lost his senses too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Denham.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you had known this man at the very time when he was stript of his estate, and if he had said to you, My dear Henry, I am unfortunate; I have just lost an inheritance which I long enjoyed peaceably; all my property is gone to support the expence of a law-suit; I have now neither town-house nor country-house; in short, nothing upon earth left. Would you have laughed at him then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>God forbid! who could be so wicked as to laugh at a man in his misfortunes! I should much rather have endeavoured to comfort him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Denham.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, then, is he happier now, when he has lost his reason besides?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>On the contrary, he is much more to be pi∣tied.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Denham.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet this day you insult and throw stones at an unfortunate man, whom you would have en∣deavoured to comfort when he was less an object of pity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear papa, I have done wrong; forgive me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="48" REF="59"/>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Denham.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pardon you willingly, if you are sorry for your fault. But my pardon is not sufficient. There is another whose forgiveness you have still to ask.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mean Joseph.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Denham.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why Joseph?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because I offended him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Denham.</SPEAKER>
<P>If Joseph had retained his senses, it would certainly be his pardon that you should demand; but as he is not able to understand what is meant by pardon, it were useless to address yourself to him. Yet you think that every one should ask pardon of those whom he has offended?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>So you have taught me, papa.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Denham.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do you know who it is that has commanded us to have compassion upon the unfortunate?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Denham.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet you have not shewn compassion to poor Joseph: on the contrary, you have aggravated his misery by your insults. Do you think that such conduct does not offend God?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I acknowledge it, and will ask forgiveness of him to-night in my prayers.</P>
</SP>
<P>Henry kept his word; he repented of his fault, and at night asked pardon of God from the bottom of his heart. And he not only ceased to trouble Joseph for several weeks himself, but he hindered also others of his comrades from insulting him. In spite of his fair resolu∣tions, however, he happened one day to mix in the rabble of boys who were following him. 'Tis true, it was purely out of curiosity, and only to see the tricks that they played upon this poor man. Now and then he could not refrain from hallooing like the rest, Joseph! Joseph! and by degrees came to be the foremost in the mob. At length Joseph's patience being tired by the shouts that pursued him, he turned short about, and taking up a large stone, threw it at him with such violence that it grazed his cheek, and almost cut off part of his ear. Henry returned home all over blood, and roaring heartily. It is a just punish∣ment on you from God, said Mr. Denham, But, replied Henry, Why have I alone been hurt, while my compa∣nions, who used him much worse than I did, have not been punished? The reason is, answered his father, that you knew better than the others, what a fault you were
<PB N="49" REF="60"/>committing, and consequently your offence was more criminal. It is very just that a child who knows the commands of God, and of his father, should be doubly punished, whenever he has such a disregard of his duty as to violate them.</P>

<P>Oh dear! you terrify me with your swearing. But only hear me. I went to glean down in yonder field, and there was a good-natured old man who saw me at work. Poor child! said he, how she labours! I will assist her. There were some sheaves lying in the field, and he pulled out of them whole handfuls of ears, which he threw into my basket. What is given to the poor, said he, God repays; and—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hardy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aha! I understand you. The old man in that field below filled your basket with ears that you have been pulling here out of our sheaves. Heh!</P>

<P>Nay, then you may go and ask himself. He can tell you.</P>

<P>I have often told you, Hardy, it is for hindering vagrants from haunting my grounds and in∣commoding my labourers, but not for seizing poor people and dragging them to prison: far less, if they be honest persons, reduced by necessity to seek a mite of nourish∣ment from my superfluity, and who meddle with nothing but a few ears of corn that lie scattered after a rich harvest.</P>

<P>Softly, Marcellus; I am thus far satisfied with your defence. We should believe all men honest, until we are convinced of the contrary.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hardy.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, my Lord, it is much better to believe all men wicked, until we see beyond a possibility of doubt∣ing that they are honest; that is much the wifest maxim. Whenever I meet an ox in my road, I always suppose him to be mischievous, and get out of his way. It may hap∣pen that he is not dangerous, but I run no risque in being cautious.

<P>If all men had your manner of thinking, with whom could we live? And what dealings could ever have subsisted between you and me, if instead of putting you into an honest service upon my estate, in order to at∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ord

<P>Yes, my Lord; I know her and I do not know her. I know that she has been here about ten days with her mother; but how or why they came here, the over∣seers can best inform you.

<P>Softly, child. I see, Hardy, it is impos∣sible to cure your suspicious temper; so that I am in∣clined to suspect too, in my turn. You judge that this lit∣tle girl has filled her basket here, because you found her in my field near a sheat. You judge that the overseers would receive a bribe, because they have admitted a poor family into the village. Well then, I judge that you

<P>You heard him say, that he did not think he was. His only fault is, that he follows his orders too literally, and that he has not discernment enough to make the proper distinctions between persons and circumstances.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, papa, explain that to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Bevil.</SPEAKER>
<P>With pleasure, my dear. When I fixed him in his employment, I gave him in charge to rid my grounds of vagrants, and to carry all such, when found upon them, before a justice. This order could only re∣gard those wretches who live by thefts and robberies, or should come to defraud or molest my tenants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! I understand. Whereas he looks upon all those as rogues who subsist upon the charity of others, and never informs himself whether old age, sickness, or ine∣vitable misfortunes, have reduced them to that condition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Bevil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very right, my dear boy! for circum∣stances alter things exceedingly. For instance, you did not shew sufficient reflexion in your dispute with him. Can you tell whether the mother of this little girl is not a dishonest person? whether the little girl herself has not told you an untruth, and actually stolen those ears of corn out of my sheaves?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marc.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my dear papa, that is impossible!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Bevil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why impossible? are you clearly informed of every thing? Do you know who she is, who her mother is, and with what view they have come here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! if you had only seen her! if you had only heard her speak! her language, her countenance, her tears! Then she is so poor as to have occasion for a handful of corn∣ears to make her bread. Need one know more than this? Should I let a poor person perish with hunger, because I do not know as yet whether he merits my assistance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Bevil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me kiss thee, my dear boy! Preserve always these generous dispositions towards the poor, and God will bless thee, as he has blest me, for the same sen∣timents, by giving birth to them in thy young heart. Mercy is always preferable to severity. A want of feeling can only lead to injustice; and if he who solicits our compassion does not merit it, the fault is his, not ours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="60" REF="71"/>
<SPEAKER>Marc.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, my dear papa, it is not prudent to commit to such men a Hardy an office which puts it in one's power to be unjust.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Bevil.</SPEAKER>
<P>You would be right, my son, if I had left to him alone the power of condemning or acquitting. He can at most commit but a slight injury, which it is easy to remedy; and this inconvenience is unavoidable. To judge of things according to the principles of equity, I have in my steward a man of good understanding, upright and noble in his sentiments. He gave me a favourable account of the little girl and her mother, as soon as they were first received into the village, and informed me that they live with old Margaret, who is a very honest woman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marc.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what if Hardy had beat the little girl, as he threatened her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Bevil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing could have carried him so far. I have forbidden him, on pain of losing his place, to strike any person whatsoever, even those whom he should sur∣prise in doing any thing amiss; and he rigorously pursues the orders that I give him.</P>

<P>I should not disguise my real name from your lordship. I find myself, indeed, under the neces∣sity of disclosing it to you, in order to justify myself in

<P>Be assured, Madam. I should not enquire these particulars without being strongly interested in them; and unless I were resolved to make amends for the injustice of fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Jenn.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was born of a good family, though little favoured by fortune. I passed my youth in London, as companion to a Lady of the first rank. Eight years ago I became acquainted with Mr. Jennings, a lieutenant∣colonel in the army, who had come to spend some months in town.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lord B.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(<HI>eagerly</HI>)</STAGE> Jennings! Jennings!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Jenn.</SPEAKER>
<P>He conceived an affection for me, and his good qualities prejudiced me in his favour. I gave him my hand, and a few days after our marriage we retired to a small estate which he had in Dorsetshire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord B.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis the same! 'tis the same! I can trace his features in the face of this child.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go on, Madam, I conjure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Jenn.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will be as brief as possble. We were beginning to enjoy, in a peaceful retirement, the happi∣ness of a most tender union. But alas! the fatigues of the service had impaired my husband's health, and a se∣vere illness seizing him, put an end to his life in a few days.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, me; before I was even born.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Jenn.</SPEAKER>
<P>He left me pregnant of this child whom you see. She was born in sorrow. As soon as my hus∣band's
<PB N="64" REF="75"/>brothers, who were hard-hearted worldly men, saw that there was no male heir, they took possession of his property; and as we had delayed from day to day the formal atte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tions requisite to put our marriage articles in force, I was obliged to be satisfied with whatever they thought proper to allow for the subsistence of me and my daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Their ungenerous avarice gives room to sup∣pose that the sum was small and could not last you long.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Jenn.</SPEAKER>
<P>It sufficed to maintain me for a few years in Dorsetshire, during which time I continued to flatter myself with the expectation of obtaining a small jointure. But at length seeing all my hopes frustrated, I took the resolution of returning to London to my former benefac∣tress. On my arrival, I learned that she had died a short time before. Having then no other resource than to fell what remained of my clothes and jewels, and to work with my own hands for a subsistence, I retired to Rich∣mond, to live private and unknown. And there I met some time ago a woman whom I had formerly known, and who lives in this village.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is old Margaret, papa.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Jenn.</SPEAKER>
<P>She had been servant to the Lady whom I mentioned. My attention to her during a severe illness attached her strongly to me. I explained my situation to her, and she proposed to me to come and live here, where I might enjoy a still more obscure retreat. I am indebted much to her hospitality, and as she has no relation to perform the last offices for her, she has given me to un∣derstand that I shall succeed to the possession of her little cottage.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is only for joy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord B.</SPEAKER>
<P>To your husband I owe my life. How happy am I then in being able to repay that kindness to his wife and his child! I served under him last war. In a
<PB N="65" REF="76"/>dangerous engagement one of the enemy's horsemen had his sword lifted over me at a time when I was quite spent with fatigue, so that I must have perished if my brave lieutenant-colonel had not saved my life by rushing upon him at the very moment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Jenn.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know him well by this description. He was as brave as he was generous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some days after, I was sent with a detachment upon a very dangerous expedition. We were surrounded and forced to yield after a long resistance. My baggage had been plundered, so that I was stript of both clothes and money. Colonel Jennings being informed of my situation procured me a recommendation to the enemy's general. Through his exertions I obtained every assist∣ance requisite whilst under cure for a deep wound that I received. I was more than two years in recovering; and when we were ordered home, had barely time to pay him a visit of acknowledgment before I was obliged to go on board immediately for the West-Indies. I married there to my advantage; and in consequence of that cir∣cumstance, returned to England about six years ago. I was preparing to fly to him, when I heard that he was no more. I little thought that his wife and daughter expe∣rienced that reverse of fortune in which I am grieved to find you at present.</P>

<HEAD>CECILIA AND MARIAN.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE the sun had risen above the horizon to en∣liven with his splendor one of the finest mornings of the spring, young Cecilia went down into her father's garden to taste with more appetite, as she roved through its walks, the sweetness of a little cake of which she in∣tended to make her breakfast.</P>
<P>Every thing that could add to the beauties of the rising day united to charm her. The pure breath of zephyr, while it diffused a calm around, refreshed every sense. Her palate was feasted with sweets; her eye with the lively freshness of the springing verdure; her smell with the balmy perfume of a thousand flowers; and that her ear alone might not be without its share of delight, two nightingales perching near her on the top of a green ar∣bour, charmed her with their morning song. Cecilia was so transported with all these delicious sensations that her fine eyes were bedewed with a moisture which, however, rested on her eye-lids without dropping in tears. Her heart felt a soft emotion and was impressed with feelings of tenderness and benevolence. All at once this agree∣able calm was interrupted by the sound of steps, and a little girl came forward towards the same walk, eating with great appetite a piece of coarse brown bread. As she, too, came into the garden for amusement, her eyes wandered from one object to another, without being fixed on any; so that she came close up to Cecilia before she per∣ceived her. On seeing who it was, she stopped short a moment, and looked down; then like a young deer that is frightened, and almost as swift as one, she ran back again with all her speed. Stop, stop, cried Cecilia, wait for me; why do you run away? But these words made the little wild creature fly still faster. Cecilia pur∣sued;
<PB N="68" REF="79"/>but, as she was less used to running, could not pos∣sibly come up with her. Luckily the little stranger had turned up another walk; and that in which Cecilia was led directly to the garden gate. Cecilia, as sensible as she was pretty, slipped softly along by a close hedge that bordered the walk, and reached the end of it just as the little girl was going to pass by. She caught hold of her unawares, crying, Ah! now you are my prisoner. Oh! I have you fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you cannot escape now. The little girl struggled to get out of her hands. Do not be ill-natured, said Ceci∣lia to her; if you knew how well I mean to use you, I am sure you would not be so shy. Come, my good child, come along with me for a moment. These friendly words, and still more, the gentle tone of voice with which they were pronounced, encouraged the little stran∣ger, and she followed Cecilia into a summer-house that was near.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marian.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because he has not so much money as your papa.</P>
</SP>

<P>But then he earns some by his work, and he could afford you houshold bread, or else something along with this to make it palatable.</P>

<P>Yes, if I was his only child; but there are five of us, and we all eat heartily; and then one wants a frock, and another a jacket, and that makes my father quite at a less what to do.

<P>Cecilia ran to her governess and begged her to give her some currant jelly for a little girl who had nothing but dry bread for breakfast. The governess was pleased with the good-nature of her amiable pupil. She gave her some in a cup, and a small roll at the same time; and Cecilia ran with all her speed to carry Marian this break∣fast.

<P>I am glad that you like it. I was pretty sure it would please you.</P>

<P>What, do you eat such as this every day? Ah! we poor people do not know what it is to taste it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry for that. Hark ye, come to see me now and then, I will always give you some. But bless me, how healthy you look! Are you never sick?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marian.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sick, what I? no never.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you never catch cold? or feel your head stuffed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marian.</SPEAKER>
<P>What sickness is that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>When one is always coughing, and blowing one's nose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marian.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, yes, that happens to me sometimes, but it is not a sickness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do they make you keep your bed then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marian.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! my mother I dare say would make a fine noise if I were to take it in my head to be lazy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what work can you do? You are so little.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="70" REF="81"/>
<SPEAKER>Marian.</SPEAKER>
<P>Must not I go in the winter to get straw for our cow, and dry sticks to make the pot boil? and in sum∣mer must I not go to weed the corn, and in harvest time to glean and pull hops? Ah, Miss, we are never at a loss for work.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>And are your sisters, too, as healthy as you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marian.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! we are all hearty, and as full of play as little mice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, now I am glad of that; I was at first afraid that God took no care of so many poor children; but since you have your health, I see that he has not forgotten you. I am very well, too, in health, though certainly not so strong as you; but, child, you go barefoot; why do not you wear shoes and stockings?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marian.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because it would cost my father too much mo∣ney, if he was to give them to us all; so he gives none of us any.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>And are not you afraid of hurting yourself?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marian.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never once mind it. God almighty made the soles of my feet hard, like shoes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should not like to lend you mine; but how comes it that you have left off eating?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marian.</SPEAKER>
<P>The time has past away in talk. I must now go and gather some greens for our cow. It will soon be eight o'clock, and she waits for her breakfast.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; take the rest of your roll with you; stop a moment; I will take out the crumb, and you shall put the jelly into the hollow of the crust.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marian.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will carry it to my youngest sister. Oh! she will not be nice about it; she won't leave the least crumb, when once she tastes it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now I love you better than ever for thinking of your little sister.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marian.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never get any thing good but I give her part. Good bye miss.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good bye Marian; but remember to come here to-morrow at the same hour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marian.</SPEAKER>
<P>If my mother does not send me somewhere else, I'll warrant I shall not fail.</P>
<P>Cecilia had now tasted the happiness of doing good. She walked a little longer in the garden, thinking how happy she had made Marian, how grateful Marian had shewed herself, and how pleased her little sister would be
<PB N="71" REF="82"/>to taste currant jelly. What will it be, said she, when I give her some ribbands and a necklace. Mama gave me some the other day that were pretty enough; but I am tired of them now. Then I'll look in my drawers for some old things to give her. We are just of a size, and my slips would fit her charmingly. Oh! how I long to see her well drest.</P>
<P>Next morning Marian slipped into the garden again. Cecilia gave her some gingerbread that she had bought for her. Marian did not fail to come every day, and Cecilia thought of nothing but new dainties to give her. When her pocket-money was out, she begged her mama to order her something out of the pantry, and her mother consented with pleasure. It happened however, one day, that Cecilia received an answer which grieved her. She was entreating her mother to advance her a little of her weekly allowance to buy shoes and stockings for Marian, that she might not go barefoot. No, my dear Cecilia, answered her mother. And why, mama? I will tell you at dinner my reasons for wishing that you would be a lit∣tle more sparing towards your favourite. Cecilia was surprized at this refusal. She never longed so much for dinner-time as that day. At length they sat down to table. Dinner was half over before her mother spoke a word concerning Marian. At length, however, a dish of shrimps that was served up furnished Mrs. Allen with an opportunity of beginning the conversation thus.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! here is my Cecilia's favourite dish, is it not? I am glad they have brought some up to-day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, mama, I like shrimps very well, and at this season they are good.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I dare say that Marian would like them still better than you do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! my poor Marian! I suppose she has never seen any. If she was only to look at these long whiskers, she would be frightened; oh! <HI>so</HI> frightened! I think I see her running away with all her speed. Mama, if you will give me leave, I should be curious to see how she would look. There, I will take only two for her, two of the smallest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am almost unwilling to consent to your re∣quest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="72" REF="83"/>
<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so, mama? You that do good to every body? I asked you this morning, too, for a little money to buy shoes and stockings for Marian, and you refused me. Marian surely must have vexed you. Has she done any m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>schief in the garden? oh! I shall be sure to scold her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. A.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my dear Cecilia, Marian has not dis∣pleased me. But do you wish by your kindness to her to make her happy or unhappy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>Happy, mama. God forbid that I should wish the contrary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I could wish, too, with all my heart, to see her more fortunate, since she has gained your esteem. But is it true, Cecilia, that she eats her bread quite dry for breakfast?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very true, mama. I would not deceive you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. A.</SPEAKER>
<P>How! and has she been content with it till now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>O dear! yes, and I never eat a tart with more pleasure than she ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> her brown bread.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I should think she has a good appetite. But I can hardly imagine that she goes barefoot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have always seen her barefoot. Ask the gar∣dener else.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then she makes them all over blood, when she walks on the gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vel or pebb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all. She runs about in the garden like a little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eer; and she says, langhing, that God almighty has made the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>les of her feet hard, like a pair of shoes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know that you never tell stories, but I con∣fess that I can hardly believe what you say now. I should be glad to see the wry faces that my Cecilia would make in eating her bread quite dry, without butter or sweet∣meats.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! I know it would stick in my throat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor should I be less curious to see how she would set about walking b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>efoot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, mama, do not be angry, but yesterday I had a mind to try. Being all alone in the garden, I took off my shoes and stockings to walk barefoot. I felt my feet sadly hurt, but still I walked on. At last I struck against a stone. Oh! that did so pain me, that I went back as softly as I could, and put on my shoes and
<PB N="73" REF="84"/>stockings, and I promised fairly never to walk barefoot again. My poor Marian! yet she is so all the summer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. A.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how comes it, then, that you cannot eat dry bread, nor walk barefoot as she does?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>The thing is, perhaps, that I am not used to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, if she uses herself, like you, to eat sweet things, and to wear shoes and stockings, and af∣terwards if the brown bread should go against her, and she should not be able to walk barefoot, do you think that you would have done her any great service?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, mama: but I mean that she shall never be obliged to do so again all her life-time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. A.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very generous design! and will your poc∣ket-money be sufficient for that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! yes, mama, if you will only add ever so lit∣tle to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. A.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know that my heart is never against help∣ing the distrest, whenever an occasion offers. But is Ma∣rian the only child that you know in necessity?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I know many others beside. There are two, especially, just by in the village, that have neither father nor mother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. A.</SPEAKER>
<P>And they without doubt stand much in need of assistance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! they do indeed, mama.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. A.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if you give Marian every thing, if you feed her with biscuits and sweetmeats, while you let the rest die with hunger, will there be much justice and hu∣manity in that management?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>But now and then I shall be able to give them something. Yet, after all, I love Marian best.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. A.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you were to die, and Marian had been used to enjoy every indulgence—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am pretty sure that she would cry for my death.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I am convinced of that. But then would she fall into indigence again, and perhaps be obliged to do some disgraceful action, in order to live well and dress well as before. Who would then have the blame of her ruin?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(<HI>sorrowfully.</HI>)</STAGE> I should, mama. So then I must never give her any thing again?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="74" REF="85"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not think so; however, I should imagine that you will do well to give her sweet things seldomer, and to make her a present rather of a good coat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I was thinking of it. I will give her, if you please, one of my frocks.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose your muslin slip would become her surprizingly; especially without shoes or stockings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! every body would point at her. How shall we do then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. A.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I were in your place, I would be sparing in my amusements for some time, and when I had saved a little money, would lay it out in buying whatever was most necessary for her. The stuff that poor children wear, is not very expensive.</P>
<P>Cecilia followed her mother's advice. Marian came feldomer indeed to see her about breakfast time, but Ce∣cilia made her other presents that were more useful. At one time she would give her an apron, another time a petti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and she paid the schoolmaster of the village so much a month for her schooling, that she might im∣prove herself perfectly in reading. Marian was so sen∣sible of these kindnesses that she grew every day more tenderly attached to Cecilia. She came frequently to see <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, and would say to her, Have you any commands for me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Is there any work that I can do for you? And when∣ever Cecilia gave her an opportunity of doing any slight service, it was pleasing to see with what joy Marian <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erted herself to oblige her. One day she came to the garden gate to wait for Cecilia's coming down, but Ce∣cilia did not come. Marian came back again, but could not see Cecilia. She returned two days successively, but no Cecilia appeared. Poor Marian was disconsolate, not finding her benefactress. Ah! said she, can it be that she does not love me? I have perhaps vexed her without meaning it. I am sure, if I knew in what, I would ask her pardon, for I could not live without loving her. Just then Mrs. Allen's maid came out. Marian stopped her. Where is Miss Cecilia? asked she. Miss Cecilia? re∣plied the woman. She has, perhaps, not long to live. I am afraid that she is in her last moments. She has the small-pox. O dear heart! cried Marian, I won't let her die: and running to the stairs, she flies up into Mrs. Allen's chamber. Madam, said she, for God's sake tell
<PB N="75" REF="86"/>me where is Miss Cecilia? I must see her. Mrs. Allen would have stopped Marian, but the door being half open, she had a sight of Cecilia's bed, and was alrea∣dy by her side. Cecilia was in a violent fever, alone, and very low in spirits; for all her little acquaintances had forsaken her. Marian, drowned in tears, took her hand, squeezed it in hers, and kissed it; saying, Ah! is it thus I find you! Do not die, I pray you; what would become of me, were I to lose you? I will stay with you night and day. I will watch over you, and serve you; will you allow me? Cecilia, squeezing her hand, signified to her that she would do her a pleasure in staying con∣stantly with her. Marian was now become, with the consent of Mrs. Allen, Cecilia's nurse; and performed this part to admiration. She had a small bed made up for her close beside her little sick friend, and never left her a moment. On the slightest expression of pain from Cecilia, Marian rose immediately to know what she wanted. She gave her, with her own hands, the medi∣cines ordered her by the physicians. Sometimes she would go and gather bulrushes, to amuse her by making handsome little rush baskets while she looked on. Some∣times she would tumble all Mrs. Allen's library over, to find pictures for her in the books. She exerted her ima∣gination in search of every thing that was capable of diverting Cecilia from the sense of her illness. Cecilia had her eyes closed by the disorder for near a week. This time appeared to her very tedious! but Marian told her stories of what happened in the village; and as she had profited well by her lessons at school, read to her what∣ever she thought would give her pleasure. Now and then, too, she addressed her with the most sensible conso∣lations. With a little patience she would say, God al∣mighty will have pity upon you, as you have had pity on me. At these words she would weep, then quickly drying her eyes, Will you let me sing you a pretty song to divert you! Cecilia had only to make a sign, and Ma∣rian would sing her all the songs that she had learned from the young country maids round about. Thus the time passed over, without hanging heavy on Cecilia. At length by degrees her health was re-established: she could open her eyes again: her lowness of spirits left her: the pock dried up, and her appetite returned. Her face was
<PB N="76" REF="87"/>still covered with red spots. Marian seemed to look at her with more pleasure than ever, while she thought how narrowly she had missed losing her. Cecilia on the other hand regarded her with equal tenderness. How shall I be able to pay you, she would say, to my satisfaction, for all that you have done for me? She asked her mama in what manner she might recompense her tender and faithful nurse. Mrs. Allen, who was almost beside herself with joy to see her dear child restored to health after so dan∣gerous an illness, answered her, Leave it to me. I shall take the charge of acquitting both your obligations and mine to her. She gave private orders to have a complete suit of clothes made for Marian, and Cecilia undertook to try it on her the first day that she should be allowed to go down into the garden. It was a day of rejoicing through the whole house. Mrs. Allen and all her family were transported with gladness at the recovery of Cecilia. Cecilia was delighted that she had it in her power to re∣compense Marian: and Marian was out of her wits with joy to behold Cecilia once more in the same spot where their acquaintance had commenced, and besides, to find herself new clad from head to foot.</P>

<HEAD>LITTLE JACK.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Churchill was returning home one day on horse∣back, after taking a ride about his own estate. As he passed by the wall of a burying-ground belonging to a small village, he heard the groans of a person on the other side. This worthy gentleman had a heart too full of compassion to hesitate in flying to the relief of the unfortunate person whom he heard groan. He alighted, and giving his horse to the servant who followed him, sprung over the enclosure of the burying-ground. He stood on tiptoe, and looking all round, at length per∣ceived in a corner, at the farthest end, a grave covered with earth that was still quite fresh. Upon this grave lay, at his full length, a child about five years old, who was weeping. Mr. Churchill approached him with looks
<PB N="77" REF="88"/>of kindness, and said to him, What dost thou do there, my little friend?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Child.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am calling my mother. They laid her here yesterday, and she does not get up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is because she is dead, my poor child.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Child.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, they say that she is dead, but I cannot be∣lieve it. She was so well the other day, when she lest me with old Susan our neighbour; she told me she was to come back, but she does not come. My father is gone away too, and my little brother, and now the other little boys of the town won't have me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Won't have you? why so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Child.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not know; but when I want to go along with them, they drive me away and leave me by myself. And they say naughty things, too, about my father and mother. That is what vexes me most of all. O mammy get up, get up!</P>
<P>Mr. Churchill's eyes filled with tears. You say that your father is gone away, and your brother too; where are they gone?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Child.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not know where my father is; and my lit∣tle brother went away yesterday to another town. There came a gentleman all in black, just like our parson, and took him away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>And where do you live now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Child.</SPEAKER>
<P>With our neighbour Susan. I am to be there until my mother comes back, as she promised me. I love my other mammy Susan very well; but
<STAGE>(<HI>pointing to the grave</HI>)</STAGE> I love my mammy that is here a great deal better. O mother, mother! why do you lie so long? when will you get up?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>My poor child, you call her in vain, for you will never awake her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Child.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, I will lie down here, and sleep by her. Ah! I saw her when they put her into a great chest to carry her away. Oh! how white she was! and how cold! I will lie down here and sleep by her.</P>
<P>Mr. Churchill could no longer refrain from tears. He stooped down, took the child up in his arms, and kissing him tenderly, said, What is your name, my poor little fellow?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Child.</SPEAKER>
<P>They call me Jackey when I am good, and when I am a bad boy they call me you Jack.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="89"/>Mr. Churchill, though in tears, smiled at this answer. Will you take me to Susan? Oh yes, yes, Sir, answered the child; and running before Mr. Churchill as fast as his little legs could go, conducted him to Susan's door. Susan was not a little surprized on seeing a gentleman enter her cottage with little Jack, who pointing to her, and running to hide his face in her lap, said, That is she; that is my other mammy. She knew not what to think of so extraordinary a visit. Mr. Churchill, how∣ever, did not leave her long in suspence. He expressed to her the situation in which he had found the child, and the compassion that he felt for him; and at the same time requested her to favour him with every information con∣cerning the parents of little Jack. Susan bade him be seated, and placing herself close by him, began thus. The father of this child is a shoe-maker, whose house joins mine. He is an honest, sober, laborious man, un∣der thirty, and a comely person. His wife was a hand∣some woman, but did not get her health well. Withal she was very careful, and a good housewise. They were married about seven years ago, lived vastly well together, and would have made the happiest couple in the world, if they had been a little better in their affairs. John had nothing but his trade, and Margaret being left an orphan, brought her husband only a little money that she had sav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the service of a worthy clergyman, the curate of the next parish. This little sum was laid out in buying a bed, and a few other articles of houshold furniture, with a small stock of leather for his work. In spite of their poverty, they contrived to maintain themselves during the first years of their marriage, by dint of labour and good management. But children came on, and then be∣gan their difficulties. Yet still they might have made it out by doubling their industry, if misfortunes had not happened to them. Poor Margaret who had worked in the fields every day during the hay time, to bring home some money at night to her husband, fell sick of fatigue, and continued so all the harvest and all winter. Phy∣sick is very expensive, and then besides, the work did not go on so well, because John's customers left him one by one, as they were afraid of being ill served in a house where there was a sick wife. At last Margaret grew bet∣ter, but her husband's business declined. He was obliged
<PB N="79" REF="90"/>to borrow money to pay the apothecary; and having lost all his customers, he was now quite out of work. At the same time Margaret could earn nothing; her strength was so much reduced that nobody would give her em∣ployment. Besides, the rent of their house, and the in∣terest of the money that they had borrowed, came heavily upon them. They were obliged more than once to suffer hunger, and thought themselves very happy when they had a morsel of bread to give to their children. At these words little Jack withdrew into a corner, and began to sob. With all this it happened that their hard-hearted landlord, seeing them not able to pay the rent of the two winter quarters, threatened John to put him in ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> They begged hard of him to have patience until the hay<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> making came on, because then they could earn some∣thing by working in the fields; but neither their entr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> nor their tears could soften him, though he is the richest man in the place. It was with much ado that he al∣lowed them a month's delay; but he swore that if at the end of that time he was not paid the whole, he would sell their furniture and put John in prison. Their house was now a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cture of melancholy and patient distress, capable of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oftening a heart of stone. You may believe me, Sir; I have often been grieved to the soul on hear∣ing the complaints of these good neighbours, and not being able to relieve them. I went once myself to their landlord, and prayed him to have compassion on their extremity. I offered to pawn to him all that I possessed in the world. But it was to no purpose. You are no better than they are, answered he; this it is to have such trash of tenants as you are all together. Ah! Sir,
<STAGE>(<HI>here the tears trickled down Susan's checks</HI>)</STAGE> I bore this reproach patiently, that I might not provoke him still more; but oh! how I suffered in being no more than a poor widow, and in not being able to afford the least comfort to those worthy people! How much good the rich might do if they had the same inclination as the poor! But to return to our unfortunate neighbours; I advised Margaret to make known her distresses to the clergyman with whom she had lived some years as an honest and worthy ser∣vant, and to beg of him to advance her some money. She answered me, that she would speak about it to her husband, but that she could hardly think of doing so,
<PB N="80" REF="91"/>because the carate might imagine that they were reduced to want through their own bad management. Three days ago she brought me her two children as she used to do, and begged me to take care of them till the evening. She intended to go to a neighbouring village, and try if she could have some hemp from the weaver to spin, in order to clear her debt. She could never bring herself to go before the clergyman her old master; but her husband was to go in her stead, and he had set off the same day. I took charge of the children with pleasure, for I loved them very well, having been at the birth of them. Mar∣garet, as she was going, clasped them to her breast and kissed them, as if it were the last time that eyer she should see them. Her eyes were swimming in tears, and she said to the eldest, Jackey, I am to be back very soon, and then I'll come and setch you. She took me by the hand, thanked me for being so good as to look after her chil∣dren, kissed them once more, and departed. A little time after, I heard an odd sort of noise in her house, that went thump, as it were; but imagining that she was gone out, I supposed it might be only the inner door clapping to, and so did not think any more about it. Well, the evening came on, it grew dark night, and I saw nothing or my neighbour. I thought I would go to her house, and see it she was gone in to lay her hemp down before she came to fetch the children. I found the door open, and went in. But O heavens! how was I struck on behold∣ing Margaret stretched at her length, stone dead, at the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of the stairs. As for me, I stood motionless, and as cold as a stone. I did not know what to do. At length after trying in vain to recover her, I ran to the surgeon who came, and feeling her pulse, shook his head and sent directly for the coroner. They held an inquest, the surgeon being present, to examine how she came by her death; and they brought it in that she must have died suddenly, or that having fallen into a fit, and not being able to call for help, she expired in that condition. I can easily imagine how it happened. She had returned into her own house to go up to the lost for the bag that was to hold her hemp, and as her eyes were still dimmed with tears, she had missed her step in coming down, and fallen from the top of the stairs, with her head foremost, on the ground. The bag that was beside her shewed it
<PB N="81" REF="92"/>plainly. Yet for all that, the coroner thought otherwise. So the body was ordered to be buried the next morning before day-light in a corner of the church-yard, and an enquiry to be made after John, to know what was be∣come of him. I proposed to the parish officers to keep the two children myself; for though I find it hard enough to live, yet, thought I, the bounteous God knows that I am a helpless widow; and if these two children come to my charge, will surely assist me to feed them. The younger brother to this did not stay long with me. Yesterday of all days, and even not long after Margaret had been buried, did the worthy curate her old master come by chance to see her. He knocked for some time at her door, and as nobody opened, he came to my win∣dow and asked me what was become of John Johnson the shoemaker that lived in the next house. I told him that if he would give himself the trouble to step in a mo∣ment, I had many things to tell him. He came in, and sat down there, just where you are. I told him all that had happened, which made him shed tears. Afterwards I told him that John had some thoughts of applying to him in his distress. He seemed surprized, and assured me positively that he had not seen John. The two children came up to him, and he fondled them a good deal. Little Jack asked him if he could not awake his mother, who had been a long time asleep. The tears came into the good curate's eyes when he heard the child talk so; and he said to me, Good woman, I will send to-morrow for these two little boys, and I will keep them at home with me. If their father returns, and should be able to bring them up, I shall restore them to him whenever he requires it. In the mean time I will take charge of their educa∣tion. All this was not very agreeable to me; for I love these little innocents as if I were their mother, and it would have given me some pain to see them snatched from me so soon. Doctor, said I to him, I cannot consent to part with these children. I am used to them, and they are used to me.—Well then, my good woman, you must give me one of them, and I will leave you the other, since he is likely to be so happy with you; and from time to time I shall send you something towards his maintenance. I could not refuse the good parson this. He asked little Jack if he should not like to go with him. What, there
<PB N="82" REF="93"/>where my mother is? said Jack; oh yes, with all my heart.—No, my little man, I do not mean there! but to my handsome house, and my handsome garden.—No, no, let me stay here with Susan. I'll go every day to where my mother is. I would rather go there than to your handsome garden. The good gentleman did not chuse to trouble the child more, who had gone to hide himself be∣hind the curtains of my bed. He told me that he would send his man for the youngest, who would give me more trouble than the other; and at his going, left me some money for this child. This, Sir, is all that I have to in∣form you of the parents of little Jack. What doubles my uneasiness at present is, that John does not return, and that a report goes in the parish, that he is gone to join a gang of smugglers, and that his wife killed herself for grief. These stories have gained such ground in the village, that there is not one, even to the children, but talks of them; and whenever my poor Jack would go amongst the other boys, they drive him away, and are ready to beat him. The poor child is quite dull, and never stirs out now, unless to go to his mother's grave.</P>
<P>Mr. Churchill had listened in silence to Susan's account, and was deeply affected by it. Little Jack was come again close up to her. He looked at her with fondness, and called her several times his mother. At length Mr. Charchill said to Susan, My worthy woman, you have conducted yourself very generously towards this unfortu∣nate family: God will not fail to reward you for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Susan.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have done no more than my duty. We are sent into this world to assist and relieve each other. I always thought that I could do nothing more pleasing in the sight of God for all the blessings that I have received from him, than to comfort my poor neighbours to the utmost of my power. Ah! if I could have done more than I did! But I am possessed of nothing in the world ex∣cept my cottage, a little garden where I have a few greens, and what I can earn by the work of my hands. Never∣theless, for these eight years that I have been a widow, God has always given me an honest support, and I hope will do so while I live.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if you keep this child, the expence of maintaining him may be very inconvenient to you, before he be capable of earning his bread.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="83" REF="94"/>
<SPEAKER>Susan.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall always take care not to let him want. We will share even to my last morsel of bread.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how are you to furnish him with clothes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Susan.</SPEAKER>
<P>I leave the care of that to him who clothes the fields with grass and the trees with leaves. He has given me fingers to sew and spin; they shall work to clothe our poor little orphan. Whosoever can pray and work, will never want.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you are resolved to keep little Jack with yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Susan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Always, Sir; I could not live under the thought of sending away this destitute infant from me, or of set∣ting him come upon the parish.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are, I suppose, related to his family?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, as I am also related to both of you, by re∣ligion and humanity, I will not suffer you alone to have all the honour of doing good to this orphan, since God has provided me with the means for it more amply than you. Commit the education of little Jack to my care; and since you are so strongly attached to each other, and that your benevolence merits my esteem as much as the child's affec∣tion for his mother, I will take you both home with me, and provide for you. Sell your garden and your cottage, and come live at my house; there you shall have a com∣fortable support and a home for the rest of your life.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Susan,</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(<HI>looking at him affectionately.</HI>)</STAGE> Do not be angry at me, sir. May God reward you for all your goodness! but I cannot accept your offers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Susan.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the first place, I am fond of the spot where I was born, and have lived so long; then again, I could not suit myself to the bustle of a great house, nor to the sight of so many folks in a family; neither am I used to ease or nice living. I should fall sick if I had nothing to do, or if I eat finer food than ordinary. Let me bide therefore in my cottage with my little Jack: it will do him no harm to live a little hard. Nevertheless, if you chuse to send him now and then a small matter, to pay for his schooling, and to furnish him with tools for whatever trade he may take up, the gracious God will not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to pay you an hundred fold; at least this boy and I will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="84" REF="95"/>daily for you that he may. I have no child; he shall be instead of one to me; and what little I possess shall be∣long to him, whenever it pleases the Lord to call me to himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, be it so. I do not wish that what I mean well should make you unhappy. I will leave little Jack with you, since you are so well together. Talk to him often of me, and tell him that I am in the place of a father to him, while you, on the other hand, will take upon you the cares and the name of the mother for whom he grieves so much. I shall send you every month what may be sufficient for your subsistence. I will come fre∣quently to see you; and my visit shall be as much on your account as his.</P>
<P>Susan lifted up her eyes to heaven, and implored its favours on Mr. Churchill. She then said to the child, Come hither, Jackey, and ask this gentleman's blessing; he will be your father now. The little boy did so; but said presently to Susan, How can he be my daddy? he wears no apron. Mr. Churchill smiled at this innocent question of little Jack, and throwing his purse on the table, Farewel, said he, generous Susan! farewel my little friend! it shall not be long before you see me again. He then left them, and mounting his horse, took the road that led to the parish where the Curate lived who had taken home the younger orphan. He found the Cu∣rate reading a letter, on which he now and then shed tears. After the first civilities, Mr. Churchill explained the subject of his visit to the worthy divine, and asked him if he knew what was become of the father of those two unfortunate children. Sir, answered the Curate, it is not a quarter of an hour since I received this letter, written by him to his wise. It was enclosed in one to me, and con∣rains a small draft for the use of his wife: he requests me to deliver it to her, and to console her for his absence. As she is dead, I have opened the letter: here it is; be so kind as to read it. Mr. Churchill eagerly took the letter, and read as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear wife,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I cannot think without uneasiness on the trouble that my absence must have occasioned you. But let me inform you of what has happened to me. Being on my way to
<PB N="85" REF="96"/>the clergyman's house, I began to think in this manner: Of what use will it be to me to go begging thus? I shall only get rid of one debt by contracting another, and shall gain nothing but the uneasiness of thinking how to pay it. I that am yet young, and can work, to go and ask so much money? I shall be taken either for an idle fellow, or a drinker. The parson to be sure married us, and loves us as his children; but if he were to take a dislike, and refuse me! or on the other hand, if he were not able to relieve us! And then supposing that he advanced me the sum for a year, should I be sure to have it in my power to pay him? and if I did not, should not I be as bad as a thief? It would be defrauding him. Thus I reasoned, my dear Margaret, and began afterwards to think how I might extricate our affairs by acting in a juster manner. I often sighed and put up my prayers to heaven. At last it came into my head all at once, thought I, you are still a young man, you are stout and able bo∣died, what harm would there be if you went on board of a man of war for a few years? You can read and write, and cast accounts pretty well. You may still make a for∣tune for your wife and children; at least you may clear all your debts. Consider that if you have good success, and happen on some prize money, it will be the making of your wife. For above half an hour these were my thoughts, when at last I saw part of a press-gang at a dis∣tance behind me. They soon came up with me, and asked me whence I came, where I was bound, and whether I would go as a volunteer? I seemed at first not to like the sea, but they questioned me again, and promised me a bounty of five pounds. I told them that for so much I would serve during the war. Done, said they. Come along with us, my lad, and the affair shall be settled pre∣sently. They brought me before the lieutenant who asked me some questions; and I answered them so much to his satisfaction that he advanced my bounty immediately. And thus, my dear Margaret, I have entered the king's service to clear my affairs. I send you a draft for the five pounds. I would not keep a penny of it. Pay the forty shillings that we owe, and whatsoever else may be due. With the remainder do the best you can to keep house. Live well, that you may recover your strength. Clothe our children, and send them soon to school. I
<PB N="86" REF="97"/>know that although you are handy and careful, you will not be able to make this sum last very long. But pa∣tience! my wages are 17s. 6d. <HI>per</HI> month; I will try if I cannot find a way to forward part of them to you at the end of a few months; and whenever we arrive in har∣bour, I shall ask leave to go on shore on purpose to see you. My dear Margaret, do not grieve; trust in God. We may soon have a peace. I will then return to you, and we shall begin housekeeping together once more. My lieutenant has promised me to write to our church∣wardens, that the parish may not be uneasy on my ac∣count. Bring up our children carefully; make them stick to home, and be fond of work. Pray with them every day, and teach them their duty, that they may grow up to be honest men; for you are very capable of instructing them well. Live in the fear of the Lord, pray to him for me, and I will pray to him in your be∣half. Answer me soon. You have only to give your letter to the doctor, he knows best how to direct it. Re∣member me to the two boys. Tell Jack that if he is a good lad, I will bring him home something at my return. God be praised for all things. Continue still to love me, who remain</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your ever faithful husband,
JOHN JOHNSON.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Mr. Churchill's eyes were filled with tears while he read this letter. When he had finished it, This man, cried he, may truly be called a good husband, a good father, and an honest man! Sir, there is a real pleasure in contributing to the happiness of such excellent people. As to John's debts, I will pay them and will enable him besides to take up his trade again decently. Let this money remain for the children who have cost their father dear; and let it be divided between them as soon as they are capable of doing for themselves. Till then keep it in your hands, and speak to them at times of it as of the strongest proof of a father's affection. I will pay you interest for it, to be joined with the capital; for I wish to have some part in this sacred deposit. The worthy curate was too much affected to be able to answer Mr. Churchill. The latter understood the force of his silence, and squeezing him by the hand, took his leave.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="98"/>All his designs in favour of John have been executed. John, being safe returned, enjoys an easiness of cir∣cumstances which he never experienced before, and would be the happiest of men, but for his grief for the loss of Margaret. He finds no other comfort, than in talking of her constantly with Susan. This worthy wo∣man looks upon herself as his sister, and as a mother to his children. Little Jack never lets a single day pass without going to his mother's grave. He has made so good a use of Mr. Churchill's generosity, in improving himself, that this excellent gentleman has it in view to establish him in the most advantageous manner. He has taken the same care of John's younger son, and he never mounts his horse without recalling to mind this affecting incident. Whenever he meets any subject of chagrin, he goes to see the persons whom he has made happy, and always returns home relieved of every uneasy sensation.</P>

<HEAD>THE MASONS ON THE LADDER.</HEAD>
<P>AS Mr. Dormer was walking one day with little Archibald his son, in one of the public squares, they stopped before a house that was building, and which was raised as high as the second story. Archibald re∣marked a number of workmen placed one above another upon the rounds of a ladder, who were moving their arms up and down successively. This appearance excited his curiosity. Papa, cried he, what game are those men playing? Let us go a little nearer to the foot of the ladder.</P>
<P>They placed themselves in a spot where there was no danger, and observed a man go and take a large stone from a heap, and carry it to another man placed on the first round of the ladder; and he, raising his arms above his head, handed the stone to a third who was placed above him, who, by the same operation, passed it up to a fourth; and thus, from one hand to another, the stone very soon reached the scaffold, where the masons were ready to make use of it.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="99"/>What do you think of this sight? said Mr. Dormer to his son. Why are so many persons employed in building this house? Would it not be better that one man singly should work at it, and that the rest should go, and each build for himself?</P>
<P>Very true, indeed, papa, answered Archibald! there would then be many more houses than there are.</P>
<P>Do you consider well, said Mr. Dormer, what you now say? Do you know how many arts and trades are con∣cerned in forming such a house as this? One single man, therefore, who would undertake a building, should be master of all these professions; so that he would spend his whole life in acquiring those different sorts of knowledge, before he could begin to build. But, supposing that he could in a short time perfect himself in every thing neces∣sary to be known for the purpose; see him all alone, and without any assistance, first digging the earth to lay his foundation; then going to seek stone, hewing it, making mortar, plaister and white-wash; in short, preparing every thing necessary to a mason. See him fell of ardor, taking his measurements, raising his ladders, erecting his scaffolds: but in what time do you think his house would be raised to the top?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! papa, I am greatly afraid that he would never be able to finish it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dermer.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are very right, child; and it is the same with all the labours of society. Were a man to with∣draw himself totally and work for himself alone; were he to refuse to borrow the aid of others, fearing to be obliged to lend them his in return, he would exhaust his strength in the undertaking, and see himself quickly under the necessity of abandoning it: whereas, if men lend their assistance mutually, they execute in a short time the most puzzling and laborious works, to perform which each of them singly would require the course of a whole life. It is the same also with the pleasures of life: he who would taste them alone could procure to himself but few enjoyments; but let all unite in contributing to their mu∣tual happiness, and each will find his share in this union.— You are one day to be a member of society, my dear child! Let the example of these workmen be always pre∣sent to your memory. You see how much they ease and shorten their labours by mutually aiding each other. We
<PB N="89" REF="100"/>will pass by here again, some days hence, and we shall find their house finished. Endeavour, therefore, to help others in their undertakings, if you wish that they should, in their turn, exert themselves to labour for you.</P>

Mrs. Carey, not much affected by the marks of tenderness which Priscilla shewed her, seemed, particularly since her husband's death, to view her with a kind of disgust. She was continually chiding her, and required perfections in her which could not even be ex∣pected from an understanding far more advanced.</P>
<P>This unjust mother fell sick. Marcus appeared strongly touched at her sufferings; but Priscilla, who, in the softened looks and languid countenance of her mother, thought she perceived an abatement of her accustomed severity, far surpassed her brother in her care and vigi∣lance. Attentive to her mother's slightest wants, she exerted all her penetration to discover them, that she might spare her even the trouble of expressing them. While her mother's illness had the least appearance of danger, she never quitted her pillow. Entreaties, or even commands, could not prevail upon her to take a moment's repose. At length Mrs. Carey recovered. This happy circumstance dissipated the apprehensions of Priscilla; but her sorrows began afresh, when she saw her mama reassume her usual severity towards her.</P>
<P>One day, when Mrs. Carey was discoursing with her children of the pains that she had suffered during her ill∣ness, and was thanking them for the tender and earnest affection which their cares for her had testified, "My dear children, added she, you may both ask of me whatever will give you most pleasure. I promise to grant it to you, if your desires are within the extent of my fortune.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="113"/>What do you wish, Marcus? said she first to her son.— A watch and a cane, mama, replied he.—You shall have them to-morrow morning.</P>
<P>And you, Priscilla?—Me, mama? me? answered she, trembling, I have nothing to wish for, if you love me.</P>
<P>That is not an answer. You shall have your recom∣pense too, miss. What would you wish? Speak.</P>
<P>Though Priscilla had been accustomed to this tone of severity, yet she felt it more sensibly on this occasion than ever she had done before. She threw herself at her mo∣ther's feet, looked up to her with eyes all drowned in tears, and suddenly hiding her face with both her hands, lisped out these words, "Give me only two kisses, such as you give my brother."</P>
<P>Mrs. Carey's heart melted at these words, and she felt those sentiments of affection to her daughter now revive which she had hitherto suppressed. Taking her up in her arms, she clasped her to her breast and loaded her with kisses. Priscilla, who for the first time received her mother's caresses, gave a loose to the effusions of her joy and love. She kissed her cheeks, her eyes, her breast, her hands: and Marcus, who could not help loving his sister, mixed his embraces with her's. They all enjoyed a happiness which was not confined to the present mo∣ment. Mrs. Carey repaid with interest to Priscilla that affection which she had before withheld from her, and Priscilla returned it with new marks of tenderness. Nor was Marcus in the least jealous on this account, but re∣joiced in his sister's happiness. He soon reaped the re∣ward of so generous a behaviour. The natural goodness of his disposition having been a little injured by the weakness and doating fondness of his mother, he gave way in youth to many little indiscretions which would have lost him her heart, but Priscilla always found means to excuse him to her. The sensible advice too which she gave him completed the reform of his manners; and they all three experienced that there is no true happiness in a family without the most cerdial union between bro∣thers and sisters and the most lively and equal affection between parents and children.</P>

<HEAD>THE LAMB.</HEAD>
<P>LITTLE Flora, the daughter of a poor countryman, was seated one morning by the side of the road, holding on her lap a porringer of milk for her breakfast, in which she sopped a few slices of coarse black bread. Just then a farmer was passing the road, who had in his cart about a score of lambs that he was going to sell at the market. These poor creatures, crowded one upon the other, with their feet tied together and their heads hang∣ing down, filled the air with plaintive bleatings, which pierced the heart of Flora, but were heard by the farmer with an ear of unconcern.</P>
<P>When he was come up opposite to the little country girl he threw down before her a lamb which he was carrying across his shoulder. "There, my girl, said he, is a good-for-nothing beast that has just died, and made me five shillings the poorer. Take it, if you will, and make a stew of it."</P>
<P>Flora quitted her breakfast, laid down her porringer and her bread, and taking up the lamb, began to examine it with looks of compassion. "But, said she immediately, why should I pity you? To-day or to-morrow they would have run a great knife through your throat, while now you have nothing more to fear." While she was speak∣ing thus, the lamb revived by the warmth of her arms, opened its eyes a little, made a slight motion, and cried <HI>baa</HI> faintly, as if it was calling its mother. It would be difficult to express the little girl's joy. She covers the lamb with her apron, and over that with her stuff petti∣coat, bends her breast down towards her lap to warm it still more, and blows with all her force into its nostrils and mouth. She felt the poor animal stir by degrees, and at each of its motions she felt her own heart throb. Encouraged by this first success, she crumbles some soft bread into her porringer, and taking it up in her fingers, with some difficulty forced it between its teeth which were shut fast. The lamb, which was dying only through hunger, felt itself a little strengthened by this nourish∣ment. It began now to stretch its limbs, to shake its head, to wag its tail, and to prick up its ears. It had soon strength enough to support itself upon its legs, and
<PB N="104" REF="115"/>then went of its own accord to Flora's porringer, who smiled to see it drink up her breakfast. In short, before a quarter of an hour was past, it had already played a thousand little gambols.</P>
<P>Flora, transported with joy, took it up in her arms, and running to the cottage, shewed it to her mother. Baba (so she named it) became from that moment the object of all her cares. She shared with it the little bread which was given her for her meals, and would not have exchanged it singly for the largest flock in the neighbour∣hood. Baba was so gratefully sensible of her fondness, that she never quitted Flora a single step: she would come to eat out of her hand, would frisk round her, and when∣ever she was obliged to go out without her, would bleat most pitifully.</P>
<P>This was not the only recompence with which Heaven repaid Flora's compassionate tenderness. Baba brought forth young lambs, and these others in their turn: so that in a few years after, Flora had a pretty flock that nourish∣ed all her family with their milk, and furnished them comfortable clothing from their wool.</P>

<HEAD>THE VINE-STUMP.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Sutton, being at his country-house in the spring, went out with his son Julius to walk in his garden. The violet and primrose were in their bloom, and many trees began already to shew their budding verdure, and to be clothed in white and crimson blossoms.</P>
<P>They went by chance into a summer-house at the foot of which rose a vine-stump twisting wildly and stretching its naked branches in a rude irregular manner. "Papa! cried Julius, see this ugly tree, how it points at me! why do not you have Martin to grub it up and make fire-wood of it?" At the same time he began to pull at it in order to tear it up, but its roots had taken too firm hold in the earth. "Do not molest it, said Mr. Sutton to his son, I will have it stand as it is, and at the proper time I shall tell you my reasons."</P>
<SP>
<PB N="105" REF="116"/>
<SPEAKER>Julius.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, papa, see close by it those lively blossoms of the lilac and the laurustinus. Why is not it as well adorned as they are, if it is to be kept? It spoils and dis∣figures the garden. Shall I go and tell Martin to pluck it up?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my dear; I tell you, I will have it stand as it is, at least a little longer.</P>
<P>Julius persevered in condemning it: his father tried to divert his attention to other objects, and the unfortunate vine-stump was forgotten.</P>
<P>Mr. Sutton's affairs called him to a distant part of the country. He set off the next day, and did not return till the middle of Autumn. His first care was to visit his country-house, whither he brought his son once more. The day being very hot, they went to enjoy the shade of the summer-house. "Ah! papa, said Julius, what a charming green shade! I thank you for having that ugly dry stump plucked up that I was so uneasy to see last Spring, and for putting in its place this handsome shrub, to give me an agreeable surprize. What delightful fruit! See, these fine grapes, some purple, others almost black. There is not a single tree in the garden that looks so well. They have all lost their fruit, but this;—see how it is covered! see those large green leaves that hide the clusters. I should like to know if the fruit be as good as it appears handsome."</P>
<P>Mr. Sutton gave him a grape to taste. This renewed his joy; and how much was it enlivened, when his father informed him that from those berries was produced that delicious liquor which he sometimes tasted after dinner. "You seem to be astonished, my dear, said Mr. Sutton. I should surprize you much more, were I to tell you that this is the same crooked mishapen stump that pointed at you in the Spring. I will go, if you chuse, and order Mar∣tin to pluck it up and make fire-wood of it."</P>

<SPEAKER>Julius.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! by no means, papa: let him take all the others in the garden before this; I do like the grapes so well!</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Sutton.</SPEAKER>
<P>You see then, Julius, that I did well in not following your advice. What has happened to you happens frequently in the world. We see a child ill clothed, and of an unpleasing outside appearance; we despise him and grow proud, on comparing ourselves with
<PB N="106" REF="117"/>him; we even carry our cruelty so far as to address him with insulting discourses. Beware, my child, of such hasty judgments. In this person, so little favoured by nature, dwells perhaps an exalted soul which will one day astonish the world by its great virtues, or enlighten it by its knowledge. It is a rugged stem, but may produce the noblest fruits.</P>

<P>LITTLE Caroline, of whom we have spoken, (page 15,) was one day playing beside her mother who was then busy writing letters. The hair-dresser being come, Mrs. P—told him to step into an adjoining dressing-room with Caroline, and to take a little of her hair off. Instead of a little, the hair-dresser took off so much that the little girl's head was entirely naked. Her mother entered just as this unlucky operation was finished. "Ah! my poor Caroline, exclaimed she, you have lost all your fine hair!"—"Do not be uneasy, mama, answered Caroline with the greatest simplicity; it is not lost, it is put up in that drawer."</P>
<P>Last Summer vacation, while she was in the country a chicken was served up at dinner, and Mrs. P—, who had no company but her children, having helped her eldest daughter to some of it, offered a bit to Caroline.</P>
<P>No, mama, answered she with a sigh; I shall not eat any of it.—</P>

<HEAD>THE FARMER.</HEAD>
<P>SIR John Downton had shut himself up one morning in his study, in order to give his attention to some affairs of consequence. A servant came to inform him that farmer Martin his tenant was at the street-door and desired to speak with him. Sir John ordered him to shew the farmer into the drawing-room, and to request him to stay a moment, until his letters should be finished. Robert, Arthur and Sophia, Sir John Downton's chil∣dren, were in the drawing-room when Mr. Martin was introduced. He saluted them respectfully as he entered, but it was easy to see that he had not learned his bow from the dancing-master; nor were his compliments of a more elegant turn. The two boys looked one at the other, smiling with an air of contempt. Their eyes measured him very familiarly from head to foot. They whispered each other and laughed out so loud that the poor man blushed and did not know what countenance to put on. Robert even carried his incivility so far, as to walk round him, holding his nose, and asking his bro∣ther, "Arthur, do not you perceive something of the smell of a dung-heap?" And going for a chasing dish of hot coals, he burnt some paper over it and carried it round the room, to disperse, as he said, the unpleasant smell. He then called a servant and desired him to sweep up the dirt that Martin had left on the floor-cloth with his nailed shoes. Arthur, mean time, held his∣sides, laughing at his brother's impertinences.</P>
<P>It was not the same with Sophia their sister. Instead of imitating the rudeness of her brothers, she reproved them for it, endeavoured to excuse them to the farmer, and approaching him with looks of good-nature, offered him wine to refresh himself, made him sit down, and took his hat and stick herself and laid them by. In the mean time Sir John came out of his study, and approach∣ing farmer Martin in a friendly manner, took him by the hand, asked how his wife and children were, and what had brought him to town. "Sir, answered the farmer, I come to pay you my half-year's rent:" and at the same time he drew out of his pocket a leathern bag full of
<PB N="108" REF="119"/>money. "You will not be displeased, continued he, that I have been something beyond my time: our roads were so flooded, that I could not carry my corn to market sooner."</P>
<P>"I am not at all displeased with you, replied Sir John: I know that you are an honest man and have no occasion to be put in mind of your engagements." At the same time he had a table laid before the farmer, to count the money on. Robert stared at the sight of farmer Martin's guineas, and seemed to look at him with a little more respect.</P>
<P>When Sir John had counted the farmer's money and found it right, the latter drew out of his great-coat pocket a small jar of candied fruits. "I have brought something said he, for the young folks. Won't you be so good, Sir John, as to let them come out one of these days, and take a mouthful of the country air with us. I'd try to enter∣tain and amuse them too, as well as I could. I have two good stout nags, and would come for them myself, and take them down in my four-wheeled chaise."</P>
<P>Sir John premised to go and see him, and would have kept him to dinner; but Mr. Martin thanked him for his kind invitation, and excused himself for not being able to accept it, as he had many bargains to make in town, and was in a hurry to return home. Sir John filled his pockets with cakes for his children, thanked him for the present that he had made to his, and having wished him good health, as well to support his fatigues as on his fa∣mily's account, saw him down stairs and took his leave.</P>
<P>As soon as he was gone, Sophia, before her brothers, informed her father of the rude reception which they had given to the honest farmer. Sir John expressed his dis∣pleasure at Robert and Arthur, and at the same time commended Sophia for her conduct. "I see, said he kissing her, that my little Sophia knows how to behave herself to honest people."</P>
<P>As it was about breakfast hour, he opened the farmer's jar of fruits and eat some of them with his daughter, and they both thought them excellent. Robert and Arthur were at table too, but were not invited to taste the fruits. They devoured them with their eyes, but Sir John did not seem to observe their longings. He resumed his com∣mendations of Sophia, and exhorted her never to despise
<PB N="109" REF="120"/>a person for the plainness of his dress. "For, said he, if we were to behave politely only to those who are well clad, we should seem to direct our civilities to the dress, not to the person who wears it. People in the most homely clothing are often the most honest; we have an instance of it in farmer Martin. He not only by his labour sup∣ports himself, his wife and children, but during these six years that he is my tenant, he pays his rents so punctually that I have never had the smallest fault to find with him in that respect. Yes, my dear Sophia, if this man was not so honest, I could not supply the expence of main∣taining you and your brothers. It is he who clothes you and procures you a good education; for it is in clothing you and paying the expences of your instruction that I dispose of the sums which he pays me every half-year."</P>
<P>After the breakfast was finished, he ordered the re∣mainder to be locked up in the beauset. Robert and Arthur followed it with desiring eyes and saw plainly that it was not kept for them. In this their father soon confirmed them. "Do not expect, said he, to taste these fruits, either to-day, or any other time. When the farmer who brought them shall have reason to be satisfied with you, he will not fail to send you some."</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, papa, is it my fault, if he did not smell well?</P>

<P>How did he smell, then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of the dung-heap, insufferably.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whence could he have contracted that smell?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>From his loading carts with it every day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>What should he do then, to get rid of it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>He should—he should—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>He should, perhaps, not put dung upon his grounds at all?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is only that way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if he did not enrich his land, how could he draw a plentiful crop from it? And if he had always bad crops, how could he manage to pay me the rent of his farm?</P>
<P>Robert would have replied, but his father gave him a look in which Arthur and he plainly read his displeasure. —The next Sunday, very early, the good farmer was at Sir John Downton's door. He sent up his compliments, and kindly invited him to come and take an excursion to
<PB N="110" REF="121"/>his farm. Sir John, pleased with his hearty obliging manner, would not mortify him by a refusal. Robert and Arthur earnestly entreated their father to make them of the party, and promised to behave themselves more civilly. Sir John yielding to their solicitations, they mounted the four-wheeled chaise with joyful looks, and as the farmer had a pair of excellent horses and drove well, they were at his house before they had any suspicion of it. Who can describe their satisfaction when the chaise stopped? Cicely, wife to farmer Martin, appeared with a smiling countenance at the wicket, which she opened, and saluted her guests; and taking the children in her arms to help them down, she kissed them, and led them into the yard. All her own children were there in their best clothes, who welcomed the young gentlemen, sa∣luting them with great respect. Sir John would willingly have stopped a moment to talk with the little ones and caress them, but Mrs. Martin pressed him to go in, lest the coffee should grow cold. It was already poured out, at a table which was covered with a napkin as white as snow. The coffee-pot was not of silver, nor the cups of china, yet every thing was in the neatest order. Robert and Arthur, however, looked at each other slily and would have burst out in a laugh if they had not feared to offend their father. But Cicely, guessing their thoughts by the looks which they exchanged, made an apology for their fare, which she confessed was not so fine as they would have had at their own house; however she hoped that they would be satisfied with the cheerful en∣tertainment of poor people. With the coffee they had muffins of a delicious taste. It was easy to see that Mrs. Martin had used all her art in kneading and baking them.</P>
<P>After breaksast, the farmer asked Sir John to look at his orchard and grounds, to which he consented. Cicely took all the pains imaginable to make this walk agreeable to the children. She shewed them all her flocks which covered the fields, and gave them the prettiest lambs to play with. She then led them to her pigeon-house: every thing there was clean and wholesome: there were on the ground two young pigeons which had just quitted their nest, but did not dare as yet to trust their callow wings. Some of the mothers were sitting over their eggs, and
<PB N="111" REF="122"/>others busied in giving nourishment to their young which had just broken the shell. From the pigeon-house they went to the bee-hives: Cicely took care that they should not go too near them, but however she gave them a view of the bees at work.</P>
<P>As most of these sights were new to the children, they seemed very much delighted with them: they were even going to take a second review of them, if farmer Martin's youngest son Tom had not come to inform them that dinner waited. They were served on pewter and drank out of Delft ware: but Robert and Arthur were still so full of the pleasure of their morning's walk that they were ashamed to indulge their satirical humour; they thought every thing excellent. It is true, Cicely had surpassed herself in preparing them the best cheer.</P>
<P>After dinner, Sir John perceived two fiddles hung up against the wall. What person here plays those instru∣ments? said he.</P>
<P>My eldest son and I, answered the farmer; and with∣out saying any more, he made a sign to Luke, his son, to take down the fiddles. They played by turns some old tunes on the fiddles, both sprightly and pathetic, of which Sir John expressed his satisfaction in the most flattering manner.</P>
<P>As they were going to hang up the instruments again, "Come Robert and Arthur, said Sir John, it is now your turns. Play us some of your best tunes:" and at the same time he put the fiddles into their hands. But they did not know even how to hold the bow, and their con∣fusion raised a general laugh.</P>
<P>Sir John then requested the farmer to put the horses to, that they might return to town. Martin pressed him strongly to pass the night with him, but at length yielded to Sir John's excuses.—"Well, Robert, said that gen∣tleman to his son, as they returned, how do you find yourself after your little journey?"</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, papa. Those good people have done their utmost to give us every satisfaction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir J. Downton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am happy to see you satisfied. But if farmer Martin had not taken so much pains in doing the honours of his house, if he had not offered you the smallest refreshment, would you have been as well pleased with him as you now seem to be?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, certainly.</P>
</SP>

<PB N="112" REF="123"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>

<P>Robert, Robert, this honest man came to our house, and far from offering him any refreshment, you made game of him. Which then is the best bred, you or the farmer?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert,</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(<HI>blushing.</HI>)</STAGE> But it is his duty to receive us well. He gains by our lands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you call gaining?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mean, that he finds it his advantage to gather in the crops of our corn-fields, and the hay of our meadows.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are right. A farmer has occasion for all that; but what does he do with the grain?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>He maintains with it, himself, his wife and his children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>And with the hay?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>He gives it to his horses to eat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what does he do with his horses?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>He uses them in plowing the ground.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thus you see, that one part of what he gains from the earth returns to it. But do you believe, that he consumes the remainder with his family and his horses!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>The cows have their part of it too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arthur.</SPEAKER>
<P>And his sheep too, and his pigeons, and his poultry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is true. But are his whole crops con∣sumed upon his own ground?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>No. I remember to have heard him say that he took part of them to market, to sell for money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what does he do with this money?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>I saw, last week, that he brought you a leathern bag full of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>You now see who draws the greatest profit from my lands, the farmer or I. It is true, he feeds his horses with hay from the meadows, but his horses serve to plow the fields which, without these plowings, would be exhausted by weeds. He feeds his sheep too, and his cows, with the hay; but their dung contributes to make the fallow grounds fruitful. His wife and his children are sed with the corn of the harvests, but in return they pass the summer in weeding the crops, and afterwards, some in reaping them, some in threshing; and these labours
<PB N="113" REF="124"/>again turn to my advantage. The rest of his corn and hay he takes to market to sell them, but it is in order to give me the money that he receives. Suppose that there remains some part for himself, is it not fair that he should have a recompence for his labours? Now therefore, once more tell me, which of us two draws the greatest profits from my lands?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>I now plainly see that you do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>And without this tenant, should I have that profit?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! there are many tenants to be had.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are right; but not one more honest than this. I had formerly let this farm to another who impo∣verished the land, cut down the trees, and let the out∣houses run to ruin. At quarter-day, he never had any money for me; and when I would expostulate with him, he shewed me clearly that his whole stock was not sufficient to answer my demand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! the knave!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>If this man were of the same kind, should I receive much profit from my estate?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>To whom then am I obliged for what I do receive?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see that you owe it to this honest farmer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it not therefore our duty to receive a man well who renders us so great services?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! papa, you make me see very plainly that I was wrong.</P>
<P>For some minutes a deep silence ensued. Sir John then resumed the discourse thus; Robert, why did not you play upon the fiddle?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know, papa, that I have never learned.</P>

<P>Remember then all your life what you have just seen and heard. This farmer so coarsely clad, who saluted and addressed you in so rustick a manner; this man is better bred than you, knows much more than you, and things of much greater use. Therefore you see how unjust it is to despise any one for the plainness of his dress or the ungracefulness of his manner.</P>

<P>I repeat it to you. Let nei∣ther of you henceforward, under pain of my displeasure, have the least connexion with the apothecary's children.</P>

<P>What has made you so angry then with Mr. Garvey?</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Crumpton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Am I obliged to give you an account?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Constantine.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, certainly. It does not become us to question you.
<STAGE>(<HI>to Alicia.</HI>)</STAGE> When my papa gives his or∣ders, it is our business to obey without reply.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Crumpton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, that is my meaning. Mr. Garvey is an obstinate, disobliging person. Ungrateful! to re∣fuse such a matter to me who am his landlord, and from whom he enjoys his fortune and livelihood!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Constantine.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is scandalous, papa: and I do not know why we have been so long connected with the chil∣dren of such people. Indeed if there had been one genteel boy besides in our neighbourhood, I should never have spoken a word to Thomas.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alicia.</SPEAKER>
<P>O papa! can you hear my brother talk so? Thomas and Grace are such good children; we should be very happy if we were as good as they.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Crumpton.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is it to me whether they be good or bad? Once more I forbid you to have a word of dis∣course with them, or else I shall keep you shut up at home.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Constantine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let Thomas dare so much as to come sneaking about this garden! I'll give him—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Crumpton.</SPEAKER>
<P>What would you say? I do not intend that they should be ill-treated, or affronted in the smallest matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Constantine,</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(<HI>confused.</HI>)</STAGE> Nay, I do not mean that, nei∣ther. I only say that I will not let them come within a hundred yards of us. Oh! I shall keep a look out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alicia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet you had so great a friendship for Mr. Gar∣vey! You looked upon him as so honest a man! as a man of so much learning and good sense! you remember very well that it was he who taught my brother Latin, and gave me my first lessons in spelling, merely through friend∣ship, before we had a master.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Crumpton.</SPEAKER>
<P>All that may be; but I forbid another word on the subject. I will have nothing to say to him, as you shall have nothing to say to his children. What? I think you cry. Dry up those tears, Miss. Have you then so little respect for your father's commands, that it costs you tears to obey them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alicia.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, papa. But pardon this last mark of regard that my heart affords them. I shall not be less obedient than my brother.</P>

<SPEAKER>Constantine.</SPEAKER>
<P>We shall see who will be most dutiful.</P>

<SPEAKER>Alicia.</SPEAKER>
<P>At least you will not insist that I should hate them. It would not be in my power to obey you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Crumpton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Neither to hate them, nor to use them ill: only to break off all connexion with them. This is my order.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alicia.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will do whatever is your pleasure. But I have one favour to ask you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Crumpton.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alicia.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I may speak to them once more, to tell them your orders.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Constantine.</SPEAKER>
<P>For what? all correspondence is at an end.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Crumpton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think your request reasonable, and grant it. You may tell them at the same time that their father must pay me in three days, or else he will repent it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alicia.</SPEAKER>
<P>How? my dear papa, does Mr. Garvey owe you any thing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Do you think that I would ask him for what he did not owe me? But that does not concern you. Only remember to obey me.

<SPEAKER>Constantine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, sister, is this your obedience to your father?</P>
</SP>

<P>You pretend to obedience? It is hypocrisy; nothing more. You only flatter him to wheedle some money from him. You love nothing in the world.</P>

<P>Because I do not take pleasure in conti∣nually disobliging him? Would you have me run after these children now he has forbidden me?</P>

<P>An ugly bird? no, you are out. Guess, Miss: but I wont keep you in pain; it is a squirrel. Oh! a comical little beast it is! He always strives to hide himself in your pocket: then he comes to eat out of your hand, and he runs after you like a little spaniel.
<STAGE>(<HI>He takes it out of its house, and gives its chain to Alicia.</HI>)</STAGE> Don't let it go, though. He must grow tame with you, otherwise he would take a trip to the grove.</P>

<P>I could have wished, Master Constantine, to have another to offer you; and I will bring you the first that I have. When he is a little used to you, Miss, he will play such tricks as will make you die with laughing. He is worse than a monkey.</P>

<P>I beg you will excuse his ill manners. You do not know, perhaps, that your father has had a quarrel with ours.</P>

<SPEAKER>Thomas.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon me, I know it, and it has made me uneasy enough. However, I did not think that the mat∣ter

<SPEAKER>Thomas.</SPEAKER>
<P>For heaven's sake, Miss Alicia, tell me, what have I done then to your brother?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alicia.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the first place the matter is that he is a little jealous on account of the squirrel that you have given me. Then he thinks that he will curry favour with <HI>our</HI> papa, in taking part in his quarrel with <HI>yours.</HI> For my papa is very angry, and I do not know why.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thomas.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor I neither. I only heard my father say as he walked about by himself, I could not have expected this from Mr. Crumpton. He then went to find my mo∣ther; and as my sister was with her then, she must know what the business was.</P>

<P>Comfort yourself, my dear Thomas; we shall still be good friends, and if we are forbidden to see each other, who will hinder us to think one of the other? Thus for in∣stance; when I play with your squirrel, I shall think of you. I will always call him by your name. Oh! how I shall love him!</P>

<P>You know, too, that this little grove was given to my father by old Mr. Drury, in return for his services to him during his life-time.</P>

<P>My father told him, that he should be very happy to oblige him; that he should never forget how much he and his family were indebted to him; but that his friend had desired him on his death-bed never to part with this grove, that it might always serve to keep him in his memory.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Alicia.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all the respect that I owe my papa, I can∣not d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but he is in the wrong here. But however, he would not have it for nothing. That is not his way of thinking.</P>

<P>You know the hill that is behind the grove? He says that will make a fine prospect. Now the grove is at the foot of the hill; so, to have the prospect, he must cut down the grove.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alicia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! now I see why he brought down an archi∣tect from town who talks to him about grottos and bridges and Chinese temples. My father dreams of nothing but improvements. He has a plan of them continually in his hands, and talks of them a hundred times a day, even to me. And I who made myself so happy to see all those fine things shortly! Ah! I'll have nothing to do with them. Let your father keep his grove.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thomas.</SPEAKER>
<P>What would become of the birds that chirp so sweetly on those venerable trees, and who generally built their nests there, because nobody disturbed them, and we carried them food there?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grace.</SPEAKER>
<P>And the refreshing cool that we breathed there in the hot summer days?</P>

<P>And then what occasion has my father for a new prospect? He has so many others on every side.</P>

<P>No, no; your father must not deprive himself of his grove.</P>

<P>Must not? Ah! he will not keep it long.</P>

<P>Why not? My papa will never go and take it from him by force, I suppose? He has not the power.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thomas.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if he is angry with us and has forbidden you to see and speak to us, I would rather give ten groves like that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>And don't you think that I would too? What should I do there without you, Miss Alicia? I should ne∣ver have any desire to go into it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alicia.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Grace, we used to be so happy in it. Do you remember when we used to go there in the even∣ing,

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grace.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and each brought her work. You sewed, and I knitted. Then, when Thomas brought us flowers, we left off our work to make nosegays. You gave me yours, and I gave you mine. That was enough to make us think of each other the whole next day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thomas.</SPEAKER>
<P>And now that is all over, never to return!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alicia.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; we shall have no more such delightful mo∣ments. It will make me grow sick, and then my papa will be sorry, and I will tell him, that if he would restore me to health, he must allow me to see my little friends again.

<P>Ah! can you doubt but we will promise?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alicia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, hear me. You know—I cannot think of it without being moved still—You know how fone my mama was of me. In her last illness, one day when I was alone with her, she called me to her bed side; shedding a flood of tears, she kissed me, and taking a purse from under her pillow, Here, my dear Alicia, said she, take this. I forbid you to let any one know that I have given it to you. Keep this money for important oc∣casions.
<PB N="123" REF="134"/>You have a kind heart and a good understand∣ing for your age; (it was mama, however, that said this.) You will know how to dispose of it worthily. Your father has a noble and generous soul, but is something passionate and revengeful. You may, perhaps, spare him occasions of vexation or sorrow. On so extensive an estate as ours, there must be many poor people who have suf∣fered undeserved losses; such you may assist in secret. You may also repay such services as may be done you, without having always recourse to your father. It is through your hands that I have for these two years past distributed my favours and my assistance: I hope that you have acquired sufficient discernment to distinguish those who have a claim to pity. In short, I doubt not but you will make the best use of this little sum which I trust to your hands, for the benefit of honesty in distress. I shall think that I myself have done the good which you shall do; and it is the best means by which I can be pre∣sent to your memory."

<P>My mama had a great friendship for them too. She told me at her death, always to look upon Mr. Garvey as one of my best friends, and to follow his sensible advice in every thing. You see, then, that I have obligations to you. How happy am I in honouring mama's memory; in satisfying my own gratitude; in saving my papa from an act of injustice; in sparing him the sorrow that he would feel for it; in preserving every thing; the charm∣ing little tuft of trees; our own friendship; the pleasure of seeing each other as before—</P>

<P>Well, papa, was I wrong? You see what pains my sister takes to obey you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Crumpton.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what is this story of a squirrel?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Constantine.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not tell it to you while we were hid, because they would have heard us. But here is the affair: The dear friend Thomas made a present of the squirrel to the dear friend Alicia. The dear friend Alicia received this ugly little beast with so much pleasure, that she calls it her dear friend Tommy. But I have managed so, that she has not had much amusement with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Crumpton.</SPEAKER>
<P>How so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Constantine.</SPEAKER>
<P>They put the squirrel's little house on the summer-house bench. I slipped in there, whilst they were taking a tender farewel. I opened the little door,
<PB N="126" REF="137"/>took the squirrel out, and let him loose amongst the trees. I saw him soon climb up into a tree, and jump from branch to branch. They will be pretty cunning if they ever catch him again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Crumpton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, sir, you have done a very ras∣cally action. Did not I forbid you to molest those poor children? and you knew very well the trouble that you were going to cause to your sister.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Constantine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Since she disobeyed you, did she not deserve to be punished?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Crumpton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it to you that the right of punishing her belonged? Run, tell the gardener and his people to look for the squirrel and to bring it to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Constantine.</SPEAKER>
<P>But papa, you forbad my sister any com∣munication with Mr. Garvey's children; and will you suffer her to receive a present from them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Crumpton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was Thomas informed of my intentions when he brought the squirrel?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Constantine.</SPEAKER>
<P>At least Alicia knew them, and was not that disobeying you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Crumpton.</SPEAKER>
<P>It belonged to me to determine that. She certainly would have shewed me the present that she received; and if I thought it proper, I should order her to return it. Again I say, run and let this squirrel be found again, or you shall answer to me for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Constantine.</SPEAKER>
<P>But papa, you have heard them talk finely. My sister has money unknown to you, and she gives it to Mr. Garvey to pay you. Should not I do better, to go and watch Grace, to surprize her when she receives the purse, and to bring it to you?</P>

<STAGE>Mr. Crumpton, (musing.)</STAGE>
<P>Yes, I see that I have suffered my passion to carry me too far. What a pattern of friendship, gratitude and generosity, do these children shew! It is true, I had for∣bidden Alicia—But should I have forbidden her? should
<PB N="127" REF="138"/>I suppress those sentiments in her heart, to which I myself had given birth? Could I deprive her of the only happi∣ness which she enjoys in this solitude? the greatest happi∣ness of human life? an amiable and virtuous society with children of her own age? a blessing, the loss of which I could not make good with all my fortune? and for what reason? to satisfy an empty whim. My dear Alicia, neither those grottos, those bridges, those Chinese tem∣ples, nor all those ornaments with which I meant to em∣bellish my garden, nothing, in short, could have made you forget the unadorned grove where friendship found so sweet a retreat. What a lesson is this to me? But for you, I was also going to lose a valuable friendship. However you preserve to me the precious blessing. You save me from injustice and remorse. How your noble conduct makes me feel the unworthiness of your brother. Ill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>natured boy! in what an odious light has he shewn himself. But let me banish this mortifying idea from my heart. I am impatient to know if Mr. Garvey thinks as generously as his children. The part that he takes, will determine my happiness.

<P>Pardon me! I spoke it as I think. You have done Mr. Garvey great kindnesses, and are right to expect from him, in acknowledgement, a matter that you have so much at heart: and he is right in refusing it you, because he has reasons for not giving it up.</P>

<P>It is not for me to be the judge of them. You look upon it as his duty, in gratitude to give you up his little grove; and he looks upon the keeping of it to be also a duty of gratitude.

<HEAD>THE LITTLE MISS DECEIVED BY HER MAID.</HEAD>
<STAGE>Mrs. Barlow, Amelia.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>MAMA, will you give me leave to go and see my cousin Henry this evening?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Barlow.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I do not chuse it, Amelia.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, mama, why so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have no occasion, I suppose, to tell you my reasons. A little miss ought always to obey her parents, without allowing herself to ask them questions. However, to satisfy you that I have always a reasonable motive, whenever I order or forbid you any thing, I shall tell you. Your cousin Henry can only set you an indifferent ex∣ample; and I should fear, if you saw him too often, that you would imitate his levity and indiscretion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, mama—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>No reply, I request. You know that my orders must be followed punctually.</P>
<P>Amelia retired a little to hide her tears; and soon after, her mother being gone out, she sat down in a corner, and gave her grief full vent. Just then Nanny, who was lately come into Mrs. Barlow's service, entered the room. "How, Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Amelia, said she, are you crying? What is the matter? May not I know what troubles you?"</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Leave me, Nanny. You cannot comfort me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, why not? There was Miss Sophy, at my last service, always name to me whenever any thing ailed her, "My dear Nanny, she would say, you see what has happened to me; tell me, what must I do?" And I had always good advice to give her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="136" REF="147"/>
<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not want your advice. I tell you once more, that you can do nothing for me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Give me leave, at least, to go for your mama. She will, perhaps, be better able to comfort you. I do not like to see so pretty a miss as you in trouble.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, yes! mama, indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot believe that it was she who grieved you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who should it be, then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>I could never have thought it. I should always suppose you so reasonable, that your mama could not refute you any request. Ah! if I had a child so well disposed as you she should be her own mistress. But your mama loves to command, and for a whim would oppose your most innocent wishes. How can one have so amiable a child, and take pleasure to thwart her! I can∣not express how I saffer to see you in this situation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amelia,</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(<HI>beginning to cry afresh.</HI>)</STAGE> Ah! it will break my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, I fear it will. How red and swelled your eyes are! You are very cruel to yourself, not to let those who love you sincerely, try to give you some co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣fort. Ah! if Miss Sophy had been in half your trouble, she would not have failed to open her heart to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>I dare not mention mine to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not that, for my part, I care much about knowing it.—Oh! it is, perhaps, because your mama make you stay at home while she goes to the play.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>No: she has promised me not to go there with∣out me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, what is it, then? Your trouble seems to increase. Shall I go for your little cousin? You may play along with him to divert you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amelia,</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(<HI>sighing.</HI>)</STAGE> Ah! I shall not have that pleasure any more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>It will not be hard to procure it for you. A young mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s should have some company. Your mama has not a mind to make a nun of you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not allowed to see him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not to see him? I do not know what your mama thinks. Miss Sophy's was just the same. She would never let her have the least intimacy with Miss Semple. But how we contrived to deceive her!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="137" REF="148"/>
<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>How was that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>We watched the moment when she went out to pay visits: then either Miss Sophy went to Miss Semple, or Miss Semple came to her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>And her mama did not know it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was I that guarded against that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if I were to go to see my cousin, and mama should ask, Where is Amelia?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would tell her that you were in the garden: or, if it was a little late, I would tell her that you were gone to bed, and fast asleep; and immediately I would run to find you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! if I thought that my mama would know nothing of it—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Trust me for that: she will never suspect it. Will you take my advice? Go and pass the evening with your little cousin. Never trouble yourself about the rest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have a mind to try it for once. But you pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mise me at least that mama—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go! never fear!</P>
<P>Amelia in effect did go to see her cousin. Her mama came home a short time after, and asked where she was. Nanny answered, that she had been tired of sitting all alone, so had eaten a good supper, and was gone to bed.</P>
<P>In this manner Amelia deceived her unsuspecting mama several times. Ah! much more did she deceive herself in acting thus. Before, she was always cheerful, and took pleasure in being near her mama, and would run with joy to meet her, whenever she had been absent a moment. But now, what was become of her chearful∣ness? She was ever saying to herself, "O dear! if mama knew where I have been!" and she trembled whenever she heard her voice. If at any time she saw her look a little serious, "I am undone! she would cry. Mama has discovered that I have disobeyed her." But this was not all that made her unhappy. Nanny would often cunningly tell her how generous Miss Sophy had been to her; how often she had given her sugar and tea; and how freely she had trusted her with the keys of the cellar and beaufet. Amelia took pride in deserving from Nanny the same praises for considence and generosity. She stole sugar and tea from her mama for Nanny, and found means to procure her the keys of the cellar and
<PB N="138" REF="149"/>beauset. Nevertheless, sometimes she felt the reproaches of her conscience. "I am doing wrong, she would say to herself, and my tricks will be found out sooner or later. I shall lose the friendship of mama." She then went to Nanny, and protested that she would never give her any thing again. "Just as you please, miss, answered Nanny; but take care; you may perhaps, have reason to repent it! Stay till your mama comes home, I will tell her how obe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iently you have followed her orders." Amelia cried and did every thing that Nanny desired her. Be∣fore, it was Nanny that obeyed Amelia; but now it was Amelia that obeyed Nanny. She suffered every sort of rudeness from her, and had nobody to whom she could complain. The wicked girl came to her one day and said, "You must know, I have a fancy to taste the pie that was looked up in the beauset yesterday; besides that, I want a bottle of wine. You must go and look for the keys of your mama's drawers."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, dear Nanny!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are not talking about dear Nanny! Do you mind what I ask of you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, mama will see us; or if she does not see us, God Almighty will see us and punish us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>He saw you all the times that you went to your cousin, yet I never observed that he has punished you.</P>
<P>Amelia had received good instructions in religion from her mother. She was strongly persuaded that God has always an eye upon us; that he rewards our good actions, and has only forbidden us what is evil, because it is h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt∣ful to us. It was through mere thoughtlessness that she went to see her cousin, contrary to her mama's orders. But it always happens that, from yielding to one error, one fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls immediately into another. She saw herself obliged to do every wrong thing that her servant ordered her, for fear of being betrayed by her.</P>
<P>It may easily be imagined how much she suffered in this situation. She one day withdrew to her chamber, in order to weep at her ease. "Oh! cried she, how much is one to be pitied who is disobedient! Unhappy child<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that I am! Slave to my own servant! I can no longer do what is my duty, but am forced to do what a wicked maid orders me. I must be a liar, a thief and a hypocrite! Lord have mercy on me!" Saying thus, she held up
<PB N="139" REF="150"/>both hands to hide her face which was drowned in tears, and began to reflect what steps she should take. At length, she rose all at once, crying, "I am resolved: and though my mama were not to let me come near her for a month; though she were to—But no, she will be reconciled to me; she will call me once more her Amelia. I depend on her fondness. But how dear it will cost me! How shall I bear her looks and reproaches! No matter; I will confess the whole to her." She then immediately sprung out of her chamber, and seeing her mama walking all alone in the garden, she flew towards her, and embracing her closely, covered her cheeks and her bosom with her tears. Grief and confusion stopped her speech.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Barlow.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is the matter, my dear Amelia?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! mama—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is the meaning of these tears?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear mama!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Speak, child! what occasions this agitation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! if I thought that you could pardon me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pardon you, since your repentance appears so lively and so sincere.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear mama, I have been a disobedient girl; I have gone several times to see my cousin Henry, contrary to your orders.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it possible, my dear Amelia? you who for∣merly feared so much to displease me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! I should not be your dear Amelia, if you knew all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>You make me uneasy: but trust every thing with me. You must have been deceived. You never gave me cause of complaint until now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, mama, I have been deceived. 'Twas Nanny, Nanny—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! it was she?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, mama: and that she might not tell you, I have often stolen the keys of the cellar and beaufet. I have stolen for her I know not how much sugar and tea.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Unhappy mother that I am! Do I hear this shocking account of my own daughter! Leave me, un∣worthy child! I shall go and consult with your father how we should treat you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, mama, I will not quit you. Punish me first, but promise me that your love for me will one day return.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="140" REF="151"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! unhappy child! you will be sufficiently punished.</P>
<P>Mrs. Barlow, at these words, left Amelia quite discon∣solate, seated on a grassy turf, and went to seek Mr. Bar∣low, and they concerted together the means of saving their child from her ruin.</P>
<P>Nanny was called up. Mr. Barlow, after loading her with the severe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> repreaches, ordered her to quit his house immediately. It was in vain that she wept and pleaded for a less <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gorous sentence. In vain she promised that nothing of the same sort should ever happen again. Mr. Barlow was inexorable. You know, answered he, how mildly I have treated you, and what indulgence I have shewn to your faults. I thought that my kindness might induce you to second my wishes as to my child's education, and it is you that have led her into disobedience and theft. You are a monster in my sight! Leave my presence, and be careful to reform, unless you wish to fall into the hands of a more terrible judge.</P>
<P>It was next Amelia's turn. She appeared before her parents in a situation worthy of pity. Her eyes were swoln with crying; all the features of her face were changed; a frightful paleness covered her cheeks, and her whole body shuddered as if in the convulsions of an ague. Unable to utter a word, she awaited in mournful silence the judgment of her father. "You have, said he in a severe voice, you have deceived, you have offended your parents. What could incline you to follow the ad∣vice of a wicked servant, rather than of your own mother, who loves you so tenderly, and desires nothing in the world so much as to make you happy? If I punished you with the indignation that your behaviour inspires; if I banished you from my sight for ever, as I have the com∣panion of your faults, who could accuse me of injustice?"</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! papa, you can never be unjust towards me. Punish me with all the severity that you shall judge neces∣sary, I will bear the whole: but begin with taking me once more in your arms; call me once more your Amelia!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Barlow.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot embrace you so soon. I am wil∣ling not to chas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se you, on account of the confession that you have made; but I shall not call you my Amelia, until you have deserved it by a long repentance. Pay great
<PB N="141" REF="152"/>attention to your conduct. Punishments always follow faults, and it is you that will punish yourself.</P>
<P>Amelia did not as yet fully understand what her father meant by these last words. She did not expect so mild a treatment: she went therefore up to her parents with a heavy heart, and curtsying to them, repeated afresh her promises of the most perfect submission. In effect, she kept her worn: but alas! her punishment followed very soon, as her father had told her. The wicked Nanny spread the most infamous stories concerning her. She told all that had passed between her and Amelia, and added a thousand horrid lies besides. She said that Amelia, by the humblest entreaties, and by the force of presents which she had stolen from her parents, had laboured so long to corrupt her, that at length the suffered herself to be persuaded to procure her secret meetings with her cousin Henry; that they saw each other every evening, unknown to their parents; and that Amelia came often home very late. These things she related with circumstances so odious, that every one con∣ceived the most disadvantageous ideas of Amelia. She was obliged to suffer the most cruel mortifications on this subject. Whenever she entered amongst a party of her little friends, she saw them all whisper each other, and look at her with an air of contempt, and an insulting smile. If ever she staid somewhat late in a company, they would say, "It is plain, she waits here until the hour of her appointment." Had she a fashionable rib∣band, or an elegant dress, they would say, "Whenever one can get one's mama's keys, one may buy what one pleases." In short, upon the least difference between her and any of her companions, "Do not talk, miss! they would say. Thinking of your cousin Henry confuses your ideas." These reproaches were so many stabs to the heart of Amelia. Often, when she was quite overwhelmed with grief, she would throw herself into her mother's arms, and seek for comfort there. Her mother generally answered her, "Suffer with patience, my dear child, what your imprudence has brought on you. Pray to God to forget your fault, and to shorten the time of your mor∣tifications. These proofs will be of service to you all your life, if you can profit by them. God has said to chil∣dren, <HI>Honour your father and your mother, and submit in all things to their will.</HI> This commandment is meant for
<PB N="142" REF="153"/>their happiness. Poor children! ye know not the world yet. Ye cannot foresee the consequences that your actions may draw after them. God has committed the care of guiding you to your parents who love you as themselves, and who have more experience and reflection to ward off every danger from you. This you did not chuse to be∣lieve; but you now experience how wisely God requires of children submission to their parents, since you have suffered so much by your disobedience. My dear Amelia, let your misfortune serve for your instruction! It is the same with all the commandments. God prescribes to us only what is advantageous: He forbids only what is per∣nicious to us. We act therefore to our own hurt, when∣ever we do what is wrong. You will often find yourself in circumstances, when it will be impossible for you to fore∣see how much vice may injure you, or how much virtue may profit you. Recollect then what you have suffered by one single fault, and regulate all the actions of your life upon this unerring principle: <HI>Every action which is contrary to Virtue, is contrary to our own happiness."</HI></P>
<P>Amelia punctually obeyed the wise advice of her mo∣ther. The more she was afterwards obliged to suffer the consequences of her imprudence, the more reserved she became and attentive to her own behaviour. She pro∣fited so well by this disgrace that, through the prudence of her conduct, she stopped the mouths of all who would speak ill of her, and obtained the name of the <HI>irreproach∣able Amelia.</HI></P>

<P>I was once just rich enough not to fear be∣coming chargeable to any body. I lent my money to a gentleman that called himself my friend. He lived mer∣rily, until at last he reduced me to poverty. I beg pardon, sir! you are a gentleman too; but I speak the truth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ann.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have as much pleasure in hearing it as you have in speaking it, though it were even against myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should have been wiser, had I worked to the last; but I was grown pale and withered, and I looked upon this change as a signal from Providence to repose myself. I never disliked work, Sir. When I was young, that supported my health: I had no other physician. But what strengthens youth, exhausts old age. I was no longer able to work. When I had lost my fortune, I was desirous to work again. I desired it with all my heart. I felt for my arms, but could not find them. Excuse me for dropping a tear when I think of it. No moment of my life ever was more heavy than when I felt myself so weak.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ann.</SPEAKER>
<P>You then had recourse to your children?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, sir: they came to me of themselves. I had only one daughter, but I found a son in her husband. They made me welcome to every thing they had, and took care of me, although I had not sixpence to leave them. May God Almighty take them to his heavenly table, as they have taken me to their table in this world!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ann.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, are they become cooler to you now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, sir, but they are become poor themselves. The floods have swept away their house and destroyed their flock: so they have borrowed money to maintain me at case till my death; the only thing that ever they did against my will. I could wish them to have a sum for my
<PB N="144" REF="155"/>funeral before-hand, that I may not be a charge to them, even when dead. It is for this reason that I come begging alms. I am an old man, but a young beggar.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ann.</SPEAKER>
<P>And where do you live?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<HEAD>THE PLEASURES AND ADVANTAGES OF A SOCIABLE CHARACTER.</HEAD>
<P>FERDINAND was by nature of a thoughtful and observing turn. In his walks with his uncle, nothing that struck his view was lost to his reflexions. His cousins complained that, while he appeared to enjoy so much
<PB N="146" REF="157"/>himself, he sought so little to contribute to the general amusement of the family. They thought at first of re∣questing their father not to take him with them any more, but a more gentle method of correcting him soon occurred. They agreed together to hold the same conduct with him, for some days, that he maintained towards them. One went to see Westminster-abbey; another the regalia and armoury at the Tower; a third the exhibition at Somerset∣house; but when they came home, the accounts which they generally gave to each other of what they remarked were suppressed. Instead of that mutual communication of the pleasures of the day which made their evenings pass so delightfully before, a grave reserve and a tiresome silence took place amongst them. Ferdinand remarked this change with as much surprize as mortification. He felt the want of those effusions of communicative chear∣fulness which, indeed, rarely originated from him, but in which he never failed to interest himself. Accustomed as he was to reflexion, he easily perceived the injustice of his own behaviour, and soon became as free as he had before been reserved. When he yielded to this amiable principle which is implanted in men by nature, in or∣der to connect and unite them by sentiment, his heart tasted the pleasures of benevolence and friendship; and his ardent desire of knowledge found new means of grati∣fication from the lights which he collected from others, at the same time that he imparted his information to them.</P>

<P>"<HI>Dear Papa,</HI></P>
<P>"I am sorry to have none but disagreeable news for you: however, it is better that you should receive them from me, than from another. Our dear Frederick"— Oh! yes. He deserves that affectionate name now.— "Our dear Frederick goes on very indifferently. He sold his watch some days ago, and what is still worse, the greatest part of his school books and books of devotion. I will tell you how I came to know it. At a standing of second-hand books, I asked the other day by chance for the Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Duty of Man; for as I had worn mine out by dint of reading it, I thought I could not do better than to buy another. The bookseller shewed me one which I knew immediately to be Frederick's. I was positive of it, as his name was upon the title page. I bought it for six∣pence, but did not say a word about it, for fear of pre∣judicing our school-fellows against him. I contented myself with shewing it to the head master who sent for the bookseller, and asked him from whom he had that book. The bookseller confessed that he had bought it from my cousin, and Frederick could not deny it, but said, that he had sold it because he wanted money; and that meantime, until he should be able to buy another, he had borrowed one from a friend who had two. The head master would know what he had done with this money, and Frederick told him, though I suspect his account to be all a fib. Oh! thought I to myself, we must find if he has not parted with some of his necessaries too. I thought first of the watch that you gave him for his new-year's gift, to let him see how his time went, which was a matter that he minded very little, as you may remember. I asked him what o'clock it was. He seemed confused and told me that his watch was at the watch-maker's. I went thither that moment, in order to be certain. There was not a word of truth in it. I ex∣postulated with him, as an affectionate cousin ought; but he answered me that it was no concern of mine, and that his watch was much better as he had disposed of it than in his sob, as he had no longer occasion to know the hour, for his business. Who knows what he may have done worse? for one cannot guess the whole."—Well what do you say to this, Dorothy?</P>

<SPEAKER>Dorothea.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear uncle, I own that I am as much dis∣pleased at my brother as you are. Notwithstanding—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Vaughan.</SPEAKER>
<P>A little patience! this is not all. The best of the story is to come.
<STAGE>(<HI>reads.</HI>)</STAGE></P>
<P>"Only hear what he has done since. The day before yesterday he went out in the afternoon without leave. Evening came on; he did not return. Supper bell rang: he was not to be found. In short, he staid out the whole night, and did not come in until the next morning. You may imagine how he was received. They asked him where he had been; but he had invented all his stories before-hand. And indeed though every thing that he said were true—however, he is to appear this evening before all the masters; and if they do him justice he will be ex∣pelled shamefully, or at least sent home. What afflicts me most is his ingratitude for all your kindnesses, the disgrace that he brings on us, and the irregular way of life that he follows. I cannot believe that he told truth, in speaking of the place where he spent the night." And, why do not you mention it? "But I wish that he may. It would be still worse, and he would only be the more worthy of your resentment. He threatens now, to run away, and go home." Yes, yes, let him come! let him only put his foot upon my threshold; he will see the con∣sequence. Let him go where he spends his nights. As for you, Dorothea, I desire you never to speak a word to me in his favour. They may put him in prison, send him home, expel him ignominiously; it is all equal to me. I shall never concern myself about him. He may go to some sea-port and ship himself as cabin-boy for the West∣Indies. I have used him as my son too long.</P>

<SPEAKER>Dorothea.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, my dear uncle, you have been as a father to us, and even our own parents could not have shewn more care and kindness to us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Vaughan.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have done it with pleasure, and take no merit to myself for it. Your mother, while I was abroad on my travels, did the same for my children. So it became my duty, and I never to this day declined it: but—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorothea.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! if my brother has forgot himself for a moment, it is owing only to his impetuous temper. You have had him long under your eye. Whenever he had
<PB N="150" REF="161"/>done a fault, his repentance and sorrow for having of∣fended you, always exceeded the offence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Vaughan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and how many indiscretions have I pardoned him? When he burned his eye-brows and hair with his fire-works; when he threw a stone through one of our neighbour's windows, and broke a large looking∣glass; when he fell into the mire, and spoiled a new suit of clothes; when he overturned the handsomest carriage that I ever had; did not I forgive him all this? I attri∣buted these mischievous freaks to a petulance that did not however as yet shew a bad disposition: but to sell his watch and his books, to leave his school a-nights and lye out, to fly against his masters, and still to have the face to think of coming home to me!</P>

Twenty times has he, by underhand complaints, had him almost turned out of the house; and then, when matters have been cleared up, he himself has been found the only person in fault.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Vaughan.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am so provoked with this boy that I have not been able to write, to send back the messenger. However, he may stay here till to-morrow morning. Let me compose myself a little.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mary Anne.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, papa! are you still angry with my poor cousin? Is his crime so very great then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Vaughan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly it becomes you much to excuse him. I see that your head is no better than his, and you would have done worse, perhaps, in his place. Yet you have both of you a good example before you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mary Anne.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who is that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Vaughan.</SPEAKER>
<P>My good boy Richard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mary Anne.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! yes. My brother is a boy of great veracity, indeed, very generous! he is a pretty pattern!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Vaughan.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know that Dolly and you are no friends to him. I myself, from your opinions of him, had con∣ceived a prejudice against him; but his master gives me such a good account of him to-day—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mary Anne.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, did not all his masters quite sicken you with his pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ises here? They knew his father's fortune, and people always hope to wheedle presents from a father, by flattering him concerning his son.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Vaughan.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant, they may have flattered me a little with regard to him; however, from his earliest child∣hood he has never played me a single prank of the thou∣sands that Frederick has.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mary Anne.</SPEAKER>
<P>His pranks never hurted any body but himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Vaughan.</SPEAKER>
<P>You would make one mad. Did he hurt nobody but himself, when he overturned my chariot? a carriage elegantly gilt, and quite new, that had just cost me two hundred pounds!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mary Anne.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was but an accident; imprudence is pardonable at his age. Peter was trying the carriage, and Frederick teazed him so much to take him up on the seat, that at last he did. After they had gone a little way, he dropped the whip, and Peter went down for it. The horses, finding the reins in weaker hands, set off.
<PB N="155" REF="166"/>Luckily the harness gave way, and nothing suffered but the carriage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Vaughan.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was not enough, perhaps! And who, upon the whole, has more reason to complain than I?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mary Anne.</SPEAKER>
<P>Frederick, who had his head terribly cut; but above all, poor Peter that lost his place by it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Vaughan.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot think of it yet with patience. That fine adventure cost me above eighty guineas!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mary Anne.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how much grief did it cost the good∣natured Frederick! He will never forgive himself for having occasioned poor Peter's disgrace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Vaughan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Two good-for-nothing fellows, sit to go together! I am surprized, however, that you pick out the worst characters, and plead their cause. Really it is a pity that you were not born a boy, to be companion to your cousin. I think, you would have had charming ad∣ventures together.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mary Anne.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but—</P>

<P>Here is the fact. Some days ago they talked of a fair that was to be in the neighbouring village. Our master gave a few of us leave to go there, in order to amuse ourselves, and gratify our curiosity.</P>

<SP>

<P>Ah! dear master, since I left your house I have never had a happy moment. You know, upon quitting your service, I went to live with Major Bramfield. Oh! what a master! he could never speak but with his cane lifted up; rest his soul!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Vaughan.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is dead then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, to the great joy of his soldiers. He never gave me his orders without swearing like a Turk. His horses had their full measure of corn, and his people plenty of hard knocks, but not much bread.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mary Anne.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! poor Peter! why did you stay in his service?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where could I go! What kept me there besides, was, that my wife found employment in the house in washing and mending the linen. She earned at least half as much as maintained our children. Every one trembled before the Major. Death alone made him tremble, and laid him low. At present I am out of place, and do not know where to lay my head.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>But you know that I never wish any one to starve, much less an old servant.</P>

<P>Ah! Mise, it is not here as in London. In the poor little villages about here, people want their corn more for themselves than for their horses. I worked at daily labour in the fields, my wife spun, and my children went about asking charity. But we all together made so little, that we were not able at the week's end to pay the rent of a poor garret. Very soon we had nothing but the earth for our bed, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for our covering. My poor wife died of grief and hardship.

When I foamed with rage like one in despair, and would destroy every thing round me, she always restored me to my calm senses, and made me a rea∣sonable man again.

<P>Oh! tell us, Peter, tell us.</P>

<P>My little Lucy went to ask a charity at the door of a public house. Master Richard and Master Frede∣rick were sitting there at a table, with some beer before them.</P>

<P>Ay! fine inclinations truly! In an alc∣house!</P>

<P>What business had he in the town at all?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mary Anne.</SPEAKER>
<P>He had leave to see the fair. Your good Richard, you see, was there too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peter.</SPEAKER>
<P>He presently knew my child, and rose from table in spite of all that his companion could say. He made poor little Lucy drink a glass of beer, took her by the hand, and leading her out, heard from herself a brief account of our misery. He then desired her to bring him to me, and found me in the next street, drinking out of my hat at a well, as the heat of my work had made me dry. I thought that I should run mad with joy upon
<PB N="162" REF="173"/>seeing him. All shabby and dirty as I was, I took him in my arms before every body; and hugged him so close, the folks were afraid that I should stifle him. Ah! he was heartily glad to see me too. At last, as there were a number of people about us, he told me to lead him to a place where we might be by ourselves, and I took him to a barn, where I had already bespoke my bed for the night.</P>

<P>I told him all that I have now told you. The dear child began to cry as if he would break his heart. I should beg for you, cried he, as I am the cause of your misfortunes; but I will not sleep without relieving them. Here, Peter, said he, feeling in his pockets, take what money I have about me. I was not for taking it; that made him angry. I told him that it was money given him for his amusement, and that as for me, I was used to hardship. He frowned, and stamped with his feet, and I verily believe would have hit me if I had not taken his purse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Vaughan.</SPEAKER>
<P>How much was there in it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Almost a crown. He would keep no more than six-pence. It shall never be said, continued he, that an honest servant of my uncle's, who has neither robbed nor defrauded any one, shall be obliged in his old age to go begging with his children, and not have so much as a lodging. Take a little room. Before three days! will return, and I will support you ever until I shall have written to my uncle. We have both provoked him against us; but he is too humane, and too generous, to abandon you to misery.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peter.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do you employ your children? said he, as he took my Billy upon his knee. Employ them? said I, they go about selling nosegays and toothpicks; and when nobody buys, they ask charity. That is not right, said he. They would never learn any thing by that trade but idleness and profligacy. You should make your boy learn a trade, and put the girl out to a decent service.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER>Mary Anne.</SPEAKER>
<P>Frederick was very right there, papa.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, said I; but how can I offer the children to any body in these rags? If I had only three guineas, I could soon settle them. There is a weaver hard by, that employs young hands, and would take my Billy, if I could give him two guineas fee; and a dairy-man's wife would take Lucy into her service, if she was a little clad. Then I could go and offer myself for service in some rich family, and not be reduced to stroll about like a vagrant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Vaughan.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what did Frederick say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing, sir. He went away, but two days after he returned. Where is the weaver that will take your son apprentice? carry me to him. So I did, and he spoke with him privately for a while. And the dairy∣man's wife, said he, that will take charge of Lucy— where does she live? I took him there too. He left me at the door, went and spoke to the woman in her dairy, joined me again without saying a word, and we came away. After we had walked about forty yards, he stopped, and taking me by the hand, My honest old friend, said he, make yourself easy as to your children. He then pointed me to a shop of second-hand clothes that happened to be not far off, where he had paid beforehand for this jacket, and this great coat.—Don't I look like a squire in them?</P>

<P>That is not all, sir. Did not I catch him slip∣ping money into my pocket? I was positively for return∣ing it to him, and told him that he had already done too much for me. But if ever I saw him fall in a passion, it was them. He assured me, sir, that you had sent it to him for my use. And when I was for coming here di∣rectly to thank you, he told me that you would not have it mentioned. Ah! thought I to myself, Mr. Vaughan was <HI>so</HI> good a master!

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peter.</SPEAKER>
<P>The case was this: They would not take my Billy without a copy of the register of his baptism, and for that I must come here to the clerk of this parish. As I entered the village, I heard that my Lord Vasty wanted a coach∣man. It seemed as if Master Frederick had sent good luck along with me. I waited on my Lord, who pro∣mised to take me if I could bring him a proper discharge from my last master. I could not go into the other world to ask the Major for one; so I took my chance, though sadly afraid, to apply to you. And should you even re∣fuse me, I shall at least have returned you my acknow∣ledgments for the relief that you were so kind as to con∣very to me through the hands of Master Frederick.</P>

<P>PAPA, I know a very good servant to re∣commend to you, when you discharge old Colin.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dexter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who has given you that commission? Have I any thoughts of sending him away?</P>

<P>Would you always keep that old fellow? I think, a young servant would do much better for us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dexter.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, Percival? That is a very bad rea∣son for being tired of a good servant. You call him an old fellow! Child, you ought to blush for it! It is in my service that he is grown old; and perhaps the cares which he took of your infancy and the sorrow that he felt for your fits of illness have hastened old age on him. You see then, how ungrateful and unreasonable it would be to take an aversion to him on account of his age. And do you think yourself any better founded in saying that a young servant would answer our purpose? That decision is above your age, and requires more experience than you can possess. At another time I will make you sensible of the advantage that an old servant has above a young one in diligent and faithful service.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Percival.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe it, papa, since you say so. But he wears a wig; and it is <HI>so</HI> droll to see a man in a wig standing behind your chair at dinner. I can hardly turn my eyes towards him, without being ready to laugh out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dexter.</SPEAKER>
<P>That does not shew a good disposition, boy! I should never have suspected you of it. Do you know that he lost his hair in a long and dangerous sick∣ness? To ridicule him, is it not to insult God who sent this sickness on him?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Percival.</SPEAKER>
<P>But he is always grumbling, and is not so merry as the other servants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dexter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Colin may be serious, but is not a grum∣bler. It is true, he is not so nimble as a young puppy of eighteen or twenty; but does he incur your dislike on that account? O son, that thought makes me shudder!
<PB N="158" REF="179"/>Then you will have an aversion to me too, if God should grant me a long life?</P>

<P>Oh! no, papa; I am not so wicked.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dexter.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do you think that it is not so to hate Colin, because his age hinders him from being so alert as formerly?</P>

<P>If I discover my fault to you, perhaps you will be angry with me and I shall gain nothing by it but a punishment.</P>

<P>You know, child, that I am not fond of punishing, and that I try that method very seldom. It is by kindness and good advice that I endeavour to cor∣rect your sister and you. I do not know what fault you have committed, therefore cannot promise absolutely not to chastise you. Is it on those terms that you intend to make a confession? You know my affection for you. That is the only security that I can give you; and you may de∣pend on it with as much confidence as on my promise.</P>

<P>How? Is it possible? Could you so far forget how you should behave to an honest man? And did Colin hear you?</P>

<P>Yes, papa; and that is what troubles me most.</P>
</SP>

<P>You have begun to open your heart to me. Conclude!</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="169" REF="180"/>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dexter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor Colin! I know him well. That ill treatment would go to his heart. It is indeed hard at his age to be the laughing stock of a child. But how much more must he suffer in receiving this treatment from a child whom he has known from his birth, and served with an attachment that can never be requited.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Percival.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! papa, how much am I to blame! I will ask his pardon; and be assured that in all my life he shall never have reason to complain of me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dexter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, child: on this condition alone God and I can pardon you. We are all weak and liable to be carried away by our passions for a moment. But when we return to ourselves, we must thoroughly repent for our fault; we must force our pride to make amends for it, and use all our resolution to avoid it for the future. But I should wish to know what could make you behave so ungenerously to Colin. Had he offended you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Percival.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, papa—At least I thought so. I was playing with my pop-gun, and aimed to shoot a pea at his face. Have done, Master Percival, says he, or I shall go and complain to your papa. His threatening made me angry, and then I called him names.</P>
</SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Percival.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot deny it.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Dexter.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is that, child?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dexter.</SPEAKER>
<P>I applaud you for that sentiment, my boy. A humane heart always rejoices to soften the distresses of its fellow-creatures. All the virtues produce joy in our souls, but none fills them with sensations more delightful and more lasting than beneficence.</P>

<P>Ah! if ever I possess the means, I will relieve all those about me that are in distress.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dexter.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is the only pleasure that never grows weak. Endeavour above all things to enjoy it in your family. If your servants are honest people, you ought to gain their affections still more by kind treatment than by money; and at the same time not neglect to make them small presents now and then. If you bestow them season∣ably, and with a good grace, you will make your servants your firmest friends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Percival.</SPEAKER>
<P>But papa, have they not their wages?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dexter.</SPEAKER>
<P>They have them for their service; no more. But small presents will create affection in them, and they will go beyond their duty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Percival.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not understand you very well, papa.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dexter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Colin will serve as an instance to explain my meaning. I give him his wages, his clothing and his food, for serving me. When he has served me, are
<PB N="171" REF="182"/>we not quit? does he owe me any thing more? At the same time, you know, he takes care of every thing in the house; he has of himself undertaken the trouble of inspecting the other servants, and has often saved me great expences. He does all this through good-will, without any particular order; because I gained his grati∣tude by occasional presents. When your years will allow you to mix in the world, you will hear nothing in every family but complaints of the negligence and ingratitude of servants. Be assured, my dear, that the fault lies oftenest with the masters who endeavour to inspire them with fear, rather than with attachment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Percival.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now I understand you perfectly; and I will one day make use of your instructions and your example.</P>

<P>I take pleasure in making you this return for acknowledging your fault, and for your generosity to honest Colin. "Captain Flood, a brave officer, who had retired from the service, lived upon his estate, with his wife, an amiable lady, and five children worthy of such excellent parents. The inhabitants of the neighbourhood possessed the greatest respect for them, and this family all together formed the most pleasing sight imaginable. The sweetness of Mr. Flood's disposition, and the excellent order that subsisted in his house, gained him the good-will and admiration of all those who had the happiness of knowing him. The young people in those parts were eager to be in his service; and whenever a place was vacant in his family by a servant's dying or going away, it was sought as a desirable situation. Content appeared in the faces of all his people. To see them, one would have taken them for dutiful children round their father. His orders were so just and so moderate, that not one of them ever had a thought of disobeying him. Harmony reigned amongst them as amongst brothers. If ever they d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s∣puted, it was which had most zeal in the service of their master, and most attachment to his interests. Mr. Ful∣mer, who was formerly an intimate of Captain Flood's,
<PB N="172" REF="183"/>and had like him retired to his estate in another county, stopped one day at his house, in passing that way on his road to London. After a variety of discourse, the con∣versation fell at last upon the disagreeable circumstances frequently attending the care of a family. Mr. Fulmer complained of the fatiguing employment of watching over servants; that he had never found any but such as were insolent, idle, or inattentive to their master's busi∣ness. As to that, said Mr. Flood, I cannot complain of mine. For these ten years I have had to weighty subject of displeasure. I am very well satisfied with them, and they are the same with me. That is a happiness not very common, said Mr. Fulmer. You must have some parti∣cular secret for making good servants, and for keeping them in that perfection. The secret is very simple, an∣swered Mr. Flood; and here it is, continued he, pointing to a small desk. I do not understand you, said Mr. Ful∣mer; but Mr. Flood, without making any reply, opened the desk. It contained six drawers, with these titles:— <HI>Extraordinary expences.—For myself.—For my wife.—For my children.—Servants wages.—Gratuities to them.</HI>—As I have always by me, resumed Mr. Flood, a year's rent of my estate beforehand, I make six portions of it at the beginning of every year. In the first drawer I put a certain sum, which is inviolably reserved for unforeseen occasions. In the second what I intend for my own expences. The third contains the money necessary for the domestic charges of the family, and my wife's pin-money. The fourth sufficient for the proper education of my children. The wages of my servants are in the fifth; and in the sixth are the gratuities that I bestow them. It is to this last drawer that I owe the happiness of having never had bad servants. Their wages are for what their duty requires of them: but the presents that I distribute to them occasionally, are for the performance of what is not strictly comprized within their duty, for services in which their affection to me out∣strips my orders and my wishes."</P>

<HEAD>ALFRED AND DORINDA.</HEAD>
<P>ON a fine summer's day, Mr. Vernon had promised to go a walking with his two children, Alfred and Dorinda, in a very fine garden a little way out of town. He went up to his dressing-room to prepare himself, and the children remained in the parlour. Alfred, delighted with the pleasures that he promised himself from his walk, jumping and running carelessly to and fro in the room, brushed the skirt of his coat against a very valuable flower that his father was rearing with infinite pains, and which he had unfortunately just brought in from before the window, in order to preserve it from the heat of the sun. O brother! what have you done? said Dorinda, taking up the flower which was broken off from the stalk. She was holding it still in her hand, when her father, who had finished dressing himself, entered the parlour. How, Dorinda, said Mr. Vernon in an angry tone, do you pluck a flower that you have seen me take so much pains to rear in order to have seed from it? Dear papa, answered Dorinda, trembling, pray do not be angry! I am not angry, replied Mr. Vernon, growing more calm; but as you may take a fancy to pluck flowers too in the garden that I am going to see, and which does not belong to me, you will not take it amiss that I leave you at home.</P>
<P>Dorinda looked down, and held her tongue. Alfred could not keep silence any longer. He approached his father with tears in his eyes, and said, It was not my sister, papa; it was I that plucked off the flower: so it is I that must stay at home. Take my sister along with you.</P>
<P>Mr. Vernon, touched with the ingenuous behaviour of his children, and their affection for each other, kissed them, and said, You are both dear to me alike, and you shall both come with me.</P>
<P>Alfred and Dorinda leaped for joy. They went there∣fore to walk in the garden, where they saw plants of the most curious sorts. Mr. Vernon with pleasure observed Dorinda press her cloaths on each side, and Alfred take up the skirts of his coat under his arms, for fear of doing any damage as they walked among the flowers. The flower that he had lost would, without doubt, have given
<PB N="174" REF="185"/>him a good deal of pleasure; but he enjoyed much more in seeing mutual affection, candour and prudence, flourish in his children.</P>

<HEAD>THE FROWARD LITTLE GIRL.</HEAD>
<P>OYe children, who have had the misfortune to con∣tract a vicious habit, it is for your comfort and en∣couragement that I tell the following story: in which you will see that amendment is easy, whenever one forms a sincere and courageous resolution.</P>
<P>Rosalind, until her seventh year, was the joy of her parents. At that age, when the growing light of reason begins to shew us the ugliness of our faults, she, on the contrary, had contracted one, which cannot better be described to you, than by the example of those snarling ours that growl incessantly, and seem always ready to run at your legs and bite them. If any one, by mistake, touched her play-things, she would give that person a side∣look, and grumble between her teeth for a quarter of an hour. If any chid her, though ever so gently, she would start up, and stamp with her feet, and throw the chairs about the room. Neither her father nor mother, nor any one of the family, could bear with her now. It is true, she sometimes repented of her faults; nay, she often shed tears in private, on seeing herself become the aversion of every body, even to her parents. But habit soon got the better of her, and her temper became more cross every day. One evening (it was New-Year's Eve) she saw her mother go towards her room with a small basket under her cloak. Rosalind would have followed her, but Mrs. Fau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ner ordered her to go back to the parlour. Upon this she put on the sullenest face that ever she shewed, and clapped the door to so violently that she made all the windows rattle. Half an hour after, her mother sent for her. What was her surprize, on seeing the room lighted up with twenty candles, and the table covered with the most elegant toys. She could not utter a word, tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns∣perted as she was with joy and admiration. Come hither, Rosalind, said her mother, and read on this paper for
<PB N="175" REF="186"/>whom these things are intended. Rosalind went to the table, and saw amongst the toys a slip of paper, on which she read the following words written in large l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tters:— <HI>For an amiable little girl, in return for her good behaviour.</HI></P>
<P>She looked down, and did not say a word. Well, Rosalind, said her mother, for whom is this intended?</P>
<P>Not for me, said Rosalind, with the tears in her eyes.</P>
<P>Here is another paper, said Mrs. Faulkener; see if this does not concern you.</P>
<P>Rosalind took it, and read, <HI>For a froward little girl, who is sensible of her faults, and in beginning a new year will take pains to amend them.</HI> Oh! that is I, that is I! said she, throwing herself into her mother's arms, and crying bitterly. Mrs. Faulkener also dropped tears, partly of sorrow for her daughter's faults, and partly of joy for the repentance that she shewed. Come, said she, after a moment's silence, take what is intended for you, and may God, who has heard your resolution, give you force to execute it!</P>
<P>No, mama, answered Rosalind, the whole belongs to the person meant in the first paper. Keep it for me, until I am like her: you can tell me when I am so. This answer gave Mrs. Faulkener much pleasure; she therefore imme∣diately put all the toys into a drawer, and giving the key to Rosalind, said, There, my dear child, you shall open the drawer when you yourself shall think it the proper time.</P>
<P>Near six weeks passed without the least instance of ill∣humour from Rosalind. She threw her arms round her mother's neck, and sobbing, asked, May I open the drawer, mama? Yes, my dear, you may, answered Mrs. Faulkener, clasping her tenderly in her arms. But pray tell me how you have managed to get the better of your temper so? I studied it continually, replied Rosa∣lind; it cost me some trouble, but every morning and evening, and a hundred times in the day, I prayed to God to keep up my courage.</P>
<P>Mrs. Faulkener shed the most delicious tears; and Ro∣salind became mistress of the toys, and soon after, of the affections of all her friends.</P>
<P>Her mother related this happy change in presence of a little miss who had the same fault; and she was so struck with it that she immediately formed the resolution of imitating Rosalind, in order to become amiable like her.
<PB N="176" REF="187"/>This attempt had the same success: and thus Rosalind was not only more happy herself, but rendered those also happy who chose to profit by her example. What child of spirit would not wish to enjoy the same honour and the same happiness?</P>

<HEAD>THE USEFUL DISAPPOINTMENT.</HEAD>
<P>ONE fine morning, in the month of June, Ambrose prepared to set out with his father on a party of pleasure, which for a fortnight before had taken up all his thoughts. He had risen, contrary to his custom, very early, in order to hasten the preparations for his jaunt. However, just as he thought that he had reached the object of his wishes, the sky darkened all at once, the clouds grew thick, and a violent wind bent down the trees and raised up a tempest of dust. Ambrose went down every moment into the garden, to observe how the sky looked: he then skipped up the stairs three at a time, to examine the baro∣meter; but the sky and the barometer were both against him. For all this, he did not scruple to give his father good hopes, and to assure him that these unfavourable appearances would disperse in a moment; that presently it would be the finest weather in the world; and he con∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uded, that they ought to set out directly, to have the benefit of it.</P>
<P>Mr. Powell, who did not repose a blind confidence in his son's prognostics, thought it more prudent to wait a little. Just then the clouds burst, and discharged a heavy shower of rain. Ambrose, who was doubly disappointed, began to cry, and obstinately refused to be comforted. The rain continued until three o'clock in the afternoon. At length the clouds dispersed, the sun resumed his lustre, the sky its clearness, and all nature breathed the freshness of the Spring. Ambrose recovered his good humour by degrees, in proportion as the sky brightened. His father took him out a little way, and the calmness of the air, the singing of the birds, the fresh green of the fields, and the sweet perfume that breathed all round him, restored peace and satisfaction completely to his heart. Do not
<PB N="177" REF="188"/>you remark, said his father to him, the agreeable change just now produced all round you? Recollect how dull every thing yesterday appeared to us; the ground parched up by a long drought, the flowers without colour and hanging their languid heads, and in short, all vegetation seeming to be at a stand. What must we suppose to have so suddenly made nature appear young again? The rain that has fallen to-day, said Ambrose.</P>
<P>The injustice of his complaints, and the folly of his be∣haviour, struck him sensibly as he pronounced these words. He blushed, and his father judged that his own thoughts would be sufficient to teach him another time to sacrifice, without reluctance, a selfish pleasure to the general advan∣tage of mankind.</P>

<STAGE>(<HI>opens it, and reads at the bottom</HI>)</STAGE> "Your affectionate mother, Catharine Dorffen." Ah! it is from his mother. Shall I read it? I wish to know her character. She will not dissemble with her own child. Let us see.
<STAGE>(<HI>reeds</HI>)</STAGE></P>
<P>"My dear son. The difficulty that you find in writ∣ing, has not, I see, hindered your complying with my re∣quest;
<PB N="183" REF="194"/>and your letter is even longer than I could expect. This willingness in you convinces me that you love me. I am sensible of it, and thank you sincerely for it. You tell me that you have been introduced to the prince; that he has been so good as to approve of you; that he is the best and mildest of masters, and that you love him very much already."
<STAGE>(<HI>He looks at the page.</HI>)</STAGE> What, my friend, you have written so to your mother? I only do my duty, then, in making you a return, and in seeking to give you proofs of my friendship. "You have reason to love him, my dear child; for without his generous assistance, what would be your lot in this world? You have lost your father; and although your mother be still living, you are not the less to be pitied. Fortune has put it out of her power to fulfil her duty to you; that is my greatest grief, and the most cruel of my distresses. While I had only to think of myself, misfortunes could never affect me; but when your image offers itself to my thoughts, my heart is ready to burst, and my tears never cease." Much tenderness, much sensibility appears here; and if she be as excellent a woman as she is a tender mother—And why should she not? She is, I have not a doubt of it. "I cannot, my dear, lead you myself in the road to fortune, as I could wish; I am obliged to remain here in solitude and retirement; but I shall never cease to give you my advice with all the earnestness of affection; and while my voice can reach you, it shall constantly entreat you to follow the paths of honour and virtue. As a fresh proof of that obedience which you have hitherto shewn to me, I request you always to carry this letter about you."
<STAGE>(<HI>Looks at the page.</HI>)</STAGE> Well, he has been obedient. "If ever you should be in danger of failing in your duty, or neglecting the advice that I gave you when I kissed you at parting, and bedewed you with my tears, then my dear son remember this letter; open it; think of your mother, your unfortunate mother, who is only supported in her solitude by the hopes that she builds on you." What has he not a brother? "Think that she would die with grief were you to behave amiss, and that you yourself would stab the heart that loves you above all things upon earth." She sees his danger. She is right, for he is much exposed here. Ought the to have sent him hither? "It is not suspicion or distrust that make
<PB N="184" REF="195"/>me speak thus. Your behaviour never gave me cause for them. No, my dear child; but your brother has made my tears flow; you, I hope, will spare the feelings of your mother more than he has done." So then, the eldest?—the ensign?—I must inform myself more of this. "You have always behaved with duty and respect; I own it with tears of joy. Go on, my dear child; be∣come an honest man, and your mother, be she ever so poor, ever so unhappy, will soon forget her misfortunes and distress." Very well. I like this woman; misfor∣tune exalts her sentiments, instead of depressing them. "You tell me at the end of your letter, that all your companions have watches. I know that you should have one too; however, you break off there, and do not ex∣press even a wish for one. This reserve pleases me, and I am unhappy in not being able to reward it. You know, my dear, that I cannot, and therefore you will pardon me. Business of importance calls me to the capital; I am going thither, and this journey will take from me what little money I have left. It is a necessary expence, and I cannot avoid it. But be assured that in the end I shall do every thing in my power to satisfy your wish. And should I even stint myself of necessaries, I will never suffer my heart's best beloved to want an encouragement to virtue. I hope soon to see you again, and am."— This woman is worthy of a better lot. I will keep this letter, and shew it to my wife. But no, it is this child's treasure; why deprive him of it?

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Dorffen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Even my happiness makes me blush. It reproaches me for the little trust that I had in Providence, and for the sorrow that I felt when you came into the world. It was but a moment after I had heard of the loss of your father. I looked at you with pity, and lamented that you ever saw the light.
<STAGE>(<HI>She takes him in her arms and kisses him.</HI>)</STAGE> Yet it was you that was to relieve your unfor∣tunate mother! your young hands were to dry up her tears! O heaven! what can I now desire more? Nothing, nothing, but to be sure of your brother's lot, and then my happiness would be complete.</P>

<P>If the prince knew what he has done—</P>

<P>I am thunder-struck. You have told him then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Nay, hardly any thing. Only all that I knew. And then he asked me concerning my brother's behaviour, and so I could not tell a fib. You know you bid me never to do so.</P>

<P><STAGE>(<HI>bowing very low.</HI>)</STAGE> Yes, sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Prince.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a great recommendation with me. Your father was a man of honour and a brave officer. I have no doubt but his example rouses your emulation, and that you strive to make yourself worthy of him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ensign Dorffen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I only do my duty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Prince.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is doing every thing. The bravest man can do no more. There, sir, is your mother: her virtues, and the hopes that may be formed of this amiable child, have given me the most favourable idea of your family; and therefore I wished to see you all assembled here.</P>

<P><STAGE>(<HI>still bowing.</HI>)</STAGE> Your highness does me particular honour!</P>

<P>No more, certainly, than you deserve.</P>

<P>Your highness judges favourably of me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Prince.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really, sir, I only want to be confirmed in the opinion that I am tempted to form of you at present, in order to make your fortune: and yet that air of free∣dom and confidence that becomes you so well—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ensign Dorffen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Prince.</SPEAKER>
<P>Denotes (permit me to say) a heart either very noble, or very corrupt. The son of such parents cannot be suspected. Certainly not. Therefore, sir, what can we do to serve you? A step higher would not ad∣vance you much in rank. What think you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ensign Dorffen</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(<HI>rubbing his hands.</HI>)</STAGE> No, certainly sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Prince.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, if we were to pass over this step? A Company! the rank of captain! It is the main object with you young gentlemen. But first— <STAGE>(<HI>turning short round to Capt. Derenhoff</HI>)</STAGE> Sir, what is your opinion of your nephew?</P>
</SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Prince.</SPEAKER>
<P>One would think it to be unfavour∣able.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. Derenhoff.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, sir, rather much the contrary; I believe that he has courage, and will be a brave—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Prince</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(<HI>looking with satisfaction at ensign Dorffen.</HI>)</STAGE> Ay is that true?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. Derenhoff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Besides, he has a promising figure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Prince.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is a fine lad, I confess. But his be∣haviour, his morals? I am ashamed, indeed, to ask you about such trifles. In short, what is his charac∣ter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. Derenhoff</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(<HI>smiling.</HI>)</STAGE> Oh! a little too airy, some∣times petulant. After all, sir, you know, that does not misbecome a soldier.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Prince.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know? Really that is something new to me. I want now, madam, only your testimony. What will you say of your son?— <STAGE>(<HI>After a pause</HI>)</STAGE> Nothing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Dorffen.</SPEAKER>
<P>What should I say of him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Prince.</SPEAKER>
<P>What you think. The truth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Dorffen.</SPEAKER>
<P>But can I, sir? If I had reason to praise him, would you wish me to do it in his presence? or should I speak to his prejudice before him who can deter∣mine his fortune?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Prince,</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(<HI>smiling.</HI>)</STAGE> Excellent, madam. To the fondness of a mother you join the address of a woman. I cannot but admire you.
<STAGE>(<HI>In a serious tone.</HI>)</STAGE> Sir, every one has his way. I have mine, when I mean to advance an officer, I begin with putting him under arrest. What do you think of it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ensign Dorffen,</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(<HI>frightened.</HI>)</STAGE> Sir—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Prince.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, that is my manner. Give up your sword to the captain. An air of more modesty would have excused all. But this confidence, this undaunted to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e—What can be expected from a person who with your conscience is master of such assurance? who should be sensible that he has deserved my displeasure? who knows how unworthily he has treated the best of mothers? and who nevertheless—Sir, let him be confined for a month. I will have no explanation upon what is past, and that on your account, madam, and because of the manner in which I came by my information; but particularly be∣cause
<PB N="197" REF="208"/>circumstances make me presume that his fault is of a weighty nature— <STAGE>(<HI>With a severe and determined voice.</HI>)</STAGE> Captain, if hereafter any thing should happen, I desire to be informed of it immediately, you understand? immedi∣ately. I mean to advance this young man; and neither you
<STAGE>(<HI>to the captain,</HI>)</STAGE> nor
<STAGE>(<HI>in a gentler tone</HI>)</STAGE> you, madam, shall make me alter my plan—Never give him any thing, never the smallest trifle by way of present. His pay may serve him; and let him learn to contract his expences.
<STAGE>(<HI>Making a sign with his hand.</HI>)</STAGE> Go, sir, to your confine∣ment.

<P>That would be a very false tenderness. No, sir, I only fear that he may have lost for ever his prince's favour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Prince.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not be uneasy, madam. My design is barely to make him worthy of the favours that I mean to bestow on him. His youth claims some indulgence, therefore I excuse his levities and indiscretion; but I shall not always do so. What in one person brings back the love of virtue along with repentance, will in another strengthen his inclination to vice. Upon the whole, make yourself easy. The young gentleman will come to him∣self, and I shall proportion my favour to his improvement.

<SPEAKER>The Prince.</SPEAKER>
<P>What would you say, madam? You do not know me. My object is to give the state a worthy
