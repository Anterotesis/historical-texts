<HEAD>AN EPISTLE To the Right Honourable Sir <HI>ROBERT WALPOLE.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>STILL let low Wits, who Sense nor Honour prize,</L>
<L>Sneer at all Gratitude, all Truth disguise;</L>
<L>At living Worth, because alive, exclaim,</L>
<L>Insult the Exil'd, and the Dead defame!</L>
<L>Such paint what Pity veils in private Woes,</L>
<L>And what we see with Grief, with Mirth expose;</L>
<L>Studious to urge—(whom will mean Authors spare?)</L>
<L>The Child's, the Parent's, and the Consort's Tear:</L>
<L>Unconscious of what Pangs the Heart may rend,</L>
<L>To lose what they have ne'er deserv'd—a Friend.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="3"/>
Such, ignorant of Facts, invent, relate,</L>
<L>Expos'd persist, and answer'd still debate:</L>
<L>Such, but by Foils, the clearest Lustre see,</L>
<L>And deem aspersing Others, praising Thee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FAR from these Tracks my honest Lays aspire,</L>
<L>And greet a gen'rous Heart with gen'rous Fire.</L>
<L>Truth be my Guide! Truth, which thy Virtue claims!</L>
<L>This, nor the Poet, nor the Patron shames:</L>
<L>When Party-Minds shall lose contracted Views,</L>
<L>And Hist'ry question the recording Muse;</L>
<L>'Tis this alone to After-Times must shine,</L>
<L>And stamp the Poet and his Theme divine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>LONG has my Muse, from many a mournful Cause,</L>
<L>Sung with small Pow'r, nor sought sublime Applause;</L>
<L>From that great Point she now shall urge her Scope;</L>
<L>On that fair Promise rest her future Hope;</L>
<L>Where Policy, from State, Illusion clear,</L>
<L>Can through an open Aspect shine sincere;</L>
<L>Where Science, Law, and Liberty depend,</L>
<L>And own the Patron, Patriot, and the Friend;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="4"/>
(That Breast to feel, that Eye on Worth to gaze,</L>
<L>That Smile to cherish, and that Hand to raise!)</L>
<L>Whose best of Hearts her best of Thoughts inflame,</L>
<L>Whose Joy is Bounty, and whose Gift is Fame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHERE, for Relief, flies Innocence distrest?</L>
<L>To you, who chase Oppression from th' Opprest:</L>
<L>Who, when Complaint to you alone belongs,</L>
<L>Forgive your own, tho' not a People's Wrongs:</L>
<L>Who still make publick Property your Care,</L>
<L>And thence bid private Grief no more despair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>ASK they what State your shelt'ring Care shall own?</L>
<L>'Tis Youth, 'tis Age, the Cottage, and the Throne:</L>
<L>Nor can the Prison 'scape your searching Eye,</L>
<L>Your Ear still opening to the Captive's Cry.</L>
<L>Nor less was promis'd from thy early Skill,</L>
<L>Ere Power enforc'd Benevolence of Will!</L>
<L>To Friends refin'd, thy private Life adher'd</L>
<L>By thee improving, ere by thee prefer'd.</L>
<L>Well hadst thou weigh'd what Truth such Friends afford,</L>
<L>With thee resigning, and with thee restor'd.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="5"/>
Thou taught'st them All <HI>extensive</HI> Love to bear,</L>
<L>And now Mankind with thee their Friendships share.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AS the rich Cloud by due Degrees expands,</L>
<L>And showers down Plenty thick on sundry Lands,</L>
<L>Thy spreading Worth in various Bounty fell,</L>
<L>Made Genius flourish, and made Art excell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HOW many, yet deceiv'd, all Power oppose?</L>
<L>Their Fears increasing, as decrease their Woes;</L>
<L>Jealous of Bondage, while they Freedom gain,</L>
<L>And most oblig'd most eager to complain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT well we count our Bliss, if well we view,</L>
<L>When Power Oppression, not Protection grew;</L>
<L>View present Ills that punish distant Climes;</L>
<L>Or bleed in Mem'ry here from ancient Times.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>MARK first the Robe abus'd <HI>Religion</HI> wore,</L>
<L>Storied with Griefs, and stain'd with human Gore!</L>
<L>What various Tortures, Engines, Fires, reveal,</L>
<L>Study'd, empower'd, and sanctify'd by Zeal?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="9" REF="6"/>
<L>STOP here my Muse!—Peculiar Woes descry!</L>
<L>Bid 'em in sad Succession strike thy Eye!</L>
<L>Lo, to her Eye the sad Succession springs!</L>
<L>She looks, she weeps, and, as she weeps, she sings.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SEE the doom'd <HI>Hebrew</HI> of his Stores bereft!</L>
<L>See holy Murder justify the Theft!</L>
<L>His ravag'd Gold some useless Shrine shall raise!</L>
<L>His Gems on superstitious Idols blaze!</L>
<L>His Wife, his Babe, deny'd their little Home,</L>
<L>Stripp'd, starv'd, unfriended, and unpity'd roam.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>LO, the Priest's Hand the <HI>Wafer-God</HI> supplies!</L>
<L>A King by consecrated Poison dies!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SEE <HI>Learning</HI> range you broad Etherial Plain,</L>
<L>From World to World, and God-like Science gain!</L>
<L>Ah! what avails the curious Search sustain'd,</L>
<L>The finish'd Toil, the God-like Science gain'd?</L>
<L>Sentenc'd to Flames th'expansive Wisdom fell,</L>
<L>And Truth from Heav'n was Sorcery from Hell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="10" REF="7"/>
<L>SEE <HI>Reason</HI> bid each mystic Wile retire,</L>
<L>Strike out new Light! and Mark!—the Wise admire!</L>
<L><HI>Zeal</HI> shall such Heresy, like <HI>Learning,</HI> hate;</L>
<L>The same their Glory, and the same their Fate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Lo, from sought Mercy, one his Life receives!</L>
<L>Life, worse than Death, that cruel Mercy gives:</L>
<L>The Man, perchance, who Wealth and Honours bore,</L>
<L>Slaves in the Mine, or ceaseless strains the Oar.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So doom'd are these, and such perhaps, our Doom,</L>
<L>Own'd we a Prince (avert it Heaven!) from <HI>Rome.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOR private Worth alone false Zeal assails;</L>
<L>Whole Nations bleed when Bigotry prevails.</L>
<L>What are sworn Friendships? What are Kindred Ties?</L>
<L>What's Faith with Heresy? (the Zealot cries.)</L>
<L>See, when War sinks the thund'ring Cannon's Roar;</L>
<L>When Wounds, and Death, and Discord are no more;</L>
<L>When Musick bids undreading Joys advance,</L>
<L>Swell the soft Hour, and turn the swimming Dance:</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="8"/>
When, to crown these, the social Sparkling Bowl</L>
<L>Lifts the chear'd Sense, and pours out all the Soul;</L>
<L>Sudden he sends red Massacre abroad;</L>
<L>Faithless to Man, to prove his Faith to God.</L>
<L>What pure persuasive Eloquence denies,</L>
<L>All-drunk with Blood, the arguing Sword supplies;</L>
<L>The Sword, which to th' Assassin's Hand is given!</L>
<L>Th' Assassin's Hand!—pronounc'd the Hand of Heaven!</L>
<L>Sex bleeds with Sex, and Infancy with Age;</L>
<L>No Rank, no Place, no Virtue stops his Rage.</L>
<L>Shall Sword, and Flame, and Devastation cease,</L>
<L>To please with Zeal (wild Zeal!) the <HI>God</HI> of <HI>Peace?</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOR less Abuse has scourg'd the Civil State,</L>
<L>When a King's Will became a Nation's Fate.</L>
<L>Enormous Pow'r! Nor noble, nor serene;</L>
<L>Now fierce and cruel; now but wild and mean.</L>
<L>See Titles sold, to raise th'unjust Supply!</L>
<L>Compell'd the Purchase! or be fin'd, or buy!</L>
<L>No public Spirit, guarded well by Laws,</L>
<L>Uncensur'd censures in his Country's Cause.</L>
<L>See from the Merchant forc'd th'unwilling Loan!</L>
<L>Who dares deny, or deem his Wealth his own?</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="9"/>
Denying, See! where Dungeon-Damps arise,</L>
<L>Diseas'd he pines, and unassisted dies.</L>
<L>Far more than Massacre that Fate accurst!</L>
<L>As of all Deaths the ling'ring is the worst.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NEW Courts of Censure griev'd with new Offence,</L>
<L>Tax'd without Power, and fin'd without Pretence;</L>
<L>Explain'd, at Will, each Statute's wrested Aim,</L>
<L>'Till Marks of Merit were the Marks of Shame;</L>
<L>So monstrous!—Life was the severest Grief,</L>
<L>And the worst Death seem'd welcome for Relief.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>IN vain the Subject sought Redress from Law,</L>
<L>No Senate liv'd the partial Judge to awe:</L>
<L>Senates were void, and Senators confin'd</L>
<L>For the great Cause of Nature and Mankind;</L>
<L>Who Kings superiour to the People own;</L>
<L>Yet prove the Law superiour to the Throne.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHO can review, without a gen'rous Tear,</L>
<L>A Church, a State, so impious, so severe;</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="10"/>
A Land uncultur'd thro' Polemic Jars,</L>
<L>Rich!—but with Carnage from intestine Wars;</L>
<L>The Hand of Industry employ'd no more,</L>
<L>And Commerce flying to some safer Shore;</L>
<L>All Property reduc'd, to Pow'r a Prey,</L>
<L>And Sense and Learning chas'd by Zeal away?</L>
<L>Who honours not each dear departed Ghost,</L>
<L>That strove for Liberty so won, so lost:</L>
<L>So well regain'd when God-like <HI>William</HI> rose,</L>
<L>And first entail'd the Blessing <HI>George</HI> bestows?</L>
<L>May <HI>Walpole</HI> still the growing Triumph raise,</L>
<L>And bid These emulate <HI>Eliza</HI>'s Days;</L>
<L>Still serve a Prince, who, o'er his People Great,</L>
<L>As far transcends in Virtue, as in State!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE Muse pursues thee to thy rural Seat;</L>
<L>Ev'n there shall Liberty inspire Retreat.</L>
<L>When solemn Cares in flowing Wit are drown'd,</L>
<L>And sportive Chat and social Laughs go round:</L>
<L>Ev'n then, when pausing Mirth begins to fail,</L>
<L>The Converse varies to the serious Tale.</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="11"/>
The Tale pathetic speaks some Wretch that owes</L>
<L>To some deficient Law reliefless Woes.</L>
<L>What instant Pity warms thy gen'rous Breast?</L>
<L>How all the Legislator stands confess'd?</L>
<L>Now springs the Hint! 'tis now improv'd to Thought!</L>
<L>Now ripe! and now to public Welfare brought!</L>
<L>New Bills, which regulating Means bestow,</L>
<L>Justice preserve, yet soft'ning Mercy know:</L>
<L>Justice shall low vexatious Wiles decline,</L>
<L>And still thrive most, when Lawyers most repine.</L>
<L>Justice from Jargon shall refin'd appear,</L>
<L>To Knowledge thro' our native Language clear.</L>
<L>Hence may we learn, no more deceiv'd by Law,</L>
<L>Whence Wealth and Life their best Assurance draw.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE freed <HI>Insolvent,</HI> with industrious Hand,</L>
<L>Strives yet to satisfy the just Demand:</L>
<L>Thus ruthless Men, who wou'd his Pow'rs restrain,</L>
<L>Oft what Severity would lose obtain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THESE, and a thousand Gifts, thy Thought acquires,</L>
<L>Which Liberty benevolent inspires.</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="12"/>
From Liberty the Fruits of Law increase,</L>
<L>Plenty, and Joy, and all the Arts of Peace.</L>
<L>Abroad the Merchant, while the Tempests rave,</L>
<L>Advent'rous sails, nor fears the Wind and Wave;</L>
<L>At Home untir'd we find th' auspicious Hand</L>
<L>With Flocks, and Herds, and Harvests, bless the Land:</L>
<L>While there, the Peasant glads the grateful Soil,</L>
<L>Here mark the Ship-Wright, there the Mason toil,</L>
<L>Hew, square, and rear magnificent the Stone,</L>
<L>And give our Oaks a Glory not their own!</L>
<L>What Life demands by this obeys her Call,</L>
<L>And added Elegance consummates all.</L>
<L>Thus stately Cities statelier Navies rise,</L>
<L>And spread our Grandeur under distant Skies.</L>
<L>From Liberty each nobler Science sprung,</L>
<L>A <HI>Bacon</HI> brighten'd, and a <HI>Spenser</HI> sung;</L>
<L>A <HI>Clarke</HI> and <HI>Locke</HI> new Tracks of Truth explore,</L>
<L>And <HI>Newton</HI> reaches Heights unreach'd before.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHAT Trade sees Property that Wealth maintain,</L>
<L>Which Industry no longer dreads to gain;</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="13" MS="y"/>
What tender Conscience kneels with Fears resign'd,</L>
<L>Enjoys her Worship, and avows her Mind;</L>
<L>What Genius now from Want to Fortune climbs,</L>
<L>And to <HI>safe</HI> Science ev'ry Thought sublimes;</L>
<L>What Royal Pow'r, from his superiour State,</L>
<L>Sees public Happiness his own create;</L>
<L>But kens those Patriot-Souls, to which he owes</L>
<L>Of Old each Source, whence now each Blessing flows?</L>
<L>And if such Spirits from their Heav'n descend,</L>
<L>And blended flame, to point one glorious End;</L>
<L>Flame from one Breast, and thence on <HI>Britain</HI> shine,</L>
<L>What Love, what Praise, O <HI>Walpole,</HI> then is thine?</L>
