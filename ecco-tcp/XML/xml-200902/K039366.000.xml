<PB REF="2"/>
<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author of the following Scenes, fully sen∣sible how much he owes to the talents of the <HI>Actor,</HI> the <HI>Musician,</HI> and the <HI>Painter,</HI> can derive no con∣fidence from the success of the representation, when he delivers them over to the judgement of the closet: But deficient as he may be in the execution of this essay, he cannot submit to be thought ignorant in the principles of Dramatic Writing; and would willingly premise the origin and progress of his design, as an explanation, if not a justification, of some of its imperfections.</P>
<P>Every one may remember how much the Fête Champétre, given by a noble Lord last summer, en∣gaged the public curiosity: It was thought, that to preserve for a more general display, an entertainment of so singular and elegant a kind, would be not only pleasing to the public, but serviceable to the polite arts. Accordingly, permission having been obtained to employ the music, and to copy some of the deco∣rations, a plan was projected for adapting them to the Stage.</P>
<P><PB REF="3"/>
The Fable, by the means of which they were to be introduced, being only the secondary object, and the intention <HI>then</HI> to confine the representation to two acts, a plot of the utmost simplicity was judged the most proper; and in that decision the Author rests upon the example of Moliere, and many of the best criticks, of, perhaps, the best age in Theatrical History; who, in pieces of this nature, though they introduced charac∣ters of comedy, purposely avoided, in several instances, those intricacies and combinations of incidents, which generally, but perhaps falsly, are supposed essential to a regular Drama.</P>
<P>It is not the business of this preface to draw a parallel between the English and French Stages, but it may not be out of place, just to touch the characters of each, provided it be permitted to lay Shakespear out of the question: He stands single and inimitable; his excellencies cannot be weighed, because it is im∣possible to counter-ballance the scale. Without ap∣peal therefore to his almost supernatural powers, we may pronounce the properties of our Stage, whether considered in Tragedy or Comedy, to consist in energy, spirit, sublimity, force of character, and of ex∣pression—like the Hercules of Farnese, all is muscle and nerve—with equal truth it must be confessed, that a few examples excepted, and those not much in the course of acting at present, we must turn to France to find the graces of the Apollo—art, regularity, elegance, delicacy, touches of sentiment, adapted only to the
<PB REF="4"/>
most polished manners, distinguish their Theatres. In literary warfare, we call their compositions insipid; they describe ours as barbarous—both are unjust—all will agree, that to blend strength and refinement would be to attain perfection.</P>
<P>No candid reader will suppose the Author of this piece means to infer, that he has in any degree accom∣plished this union, in the part which has fallen to his share; but, he will be bold to say, it is the only part which has been wanting to complete a species of entertainment new to this country; elegant in its principle, and innocent, if not beneficial, in its ten∣dency. He will be amply rewarded, even in the failure of his specimen, if it excites others, who may be better qualified, to pursue the same ideas.</P>
<P>They who suppose an English audience, because used to plain entertainment, are incapable of relish∣ing the most refined, are greatly mistaken. It is true, there will ever be spectators in the two extremes of the house, who are tasteless and despicable—to the honour of the town be it said, they are but few—and whether they bawl for a hornpipe from the Upper Gallery, or yawn in the weariness of dissipa∣pation in the Boxes, they equally betray stupidity, prejudice, or caprice: But the middle class and bulk of the assembly, like that of the kingdom at large, will ever be on the side of nature, truth, and sense. Let the piece be founded upon those principles,
<PB REF="5"/>
and applause will follow every circumstance of elegance and decoration that can accompany them.</P>
<P>A sincere zeal for the improvement of the stage, has prompted this digression. It is requisite now to return, for a moment, to the history of the un∣dertaking.</P>
<P>Mr. Garrick, after perusing the outlines of the two original acts, thought he discovered in the writer some talents for the higher species of comedy, and encouraged him to extend his plan. The scenery also, which in the first sketches promised a brilliant effect; the composition of the music, and the names of the dancers who were engaged, all seemed to require more distinction than could be given to them in an after∣piece. But the most prevalent incentive to the Au∣thor, was the promise of Mr. Garrick's assistance; his judgement pervaded the whole, and though it may diminish the poet, it is the pride of the friend, to make a public acknowledgement to that gentle∣man, in the words of Horace to Melpomene,

<L>IN Parliament, whene'er a question comes,</L>
<L>Which makes the <HI>Chief</HI> look grave, and bite his thumbs,</L>
<L>A knowing-one is sent, sly as a mouse,</L>
<L>To peep into the humour of the house:</L>
<L>I am that mouse; peeping at friends and foes,</L>
<L>To find which carry it—the <HI>Ayes</HI> or <HI>Noes:</HI></L>
<L>With more than pow'r of parliament you sit,</L>
<L>Despotic representatives of wit!</L>
<L>For in a moment, and without much pother,</L>
<L>You can <HI>dissolve</HI> this piece, and <HI>call</HI> another!</L>
<L>As 'tis no treason, let us frankly see,</L>
<L>In what they differ, and in what agree,</L>
<L>The said supreme assembly of the nation,</L>
<L>With this our great Dramatic <HI>Convocation!</HI></L>
<L>Business in both oft meets with interruption:</L>
<L>In both, we trust, no <HI>brib'ry</HI> or <HI>corruption;</HI></L>
<L>Both proud of freedom, have a turn to riot,</L>
<L>And the best <HI>Speaker</HI> cannot keep you quiet:</L>

<L>When <HI>order, order</HI>'s drown'd in <HI>hear him, hear him!</HI></L>
<L>We have, unlike to them, one constant rule,</L>
<L>We open doors, and choose our Gall'ries full:</L>
<L>For a full house both send abroad their summons;</L>
<L>With us together sit the Lords and Commons.</L>
<L>You Ladies here have votes—debate, dispute,</L>
<L>There if you go (O fye for shame!) you're mute:</L>

Never was heard of such a persecution,</L>

<L>No human laws should <HI>nature</HI>'s rights abridge,</L>
<L>Freedom of speech! our dearest privilege:</L>
<L>Ours is the wiser sex, though deem'd the weaker;</L>
<L>I'll put the question—if you chuse me speaker:</L>
<L>Suppose me now be-wigg'd, and seated here,</L>
<L>I call to <HI>Order!</HI>—you, the <HI>Chair!</HI> the <HI>Chair!</HI></L>
<L><HI>Is it your pleasure that this Bill should pass—</HI></L>

<STAGE>Part of an ornamented Farm.</STAGE>
<STAGE>Enter Sir HARRY GROVEBY and Mr. DUPELEY, meeting.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>DEAR Charles, welcome to England! and doubly welcome to Oldsworth's Oaks—Friendship I see has wings, as well as love—you arrive at the moment I wished; I hope in your haste you have not forgot a fancy dress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DUPELEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; I am a true friend, and prepar'd for all your whimsies, amorous and poetical. Your sum∣mons found me the day after my arrival, and I took post immediately—next to my eagerness to
<PB N="2" REF="12"/>
see you, was that of being in time for the Fête Champétre—Novelty and pleasure are the beings I pursue—They have led me half the world over already, and for ought I know they may sometime or other carry me to the Otaheite.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have pursued but their shadows—here they reign, in the manners of this New Arcadia, and the smiles of the sweet Maid of the Oaks.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DUPELEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who, in the name of curiosity, is she that bears this romantic title? for your letter was a mere eclogue; the devil a thing could I make out, but a rhapsody upon rural innocence, and an in∣vitation from a gentleman I did not know, to an entertainment I never saw—What, are we to have a representation of the Pastor-fido in a Garden?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Pastor-fido is before you <HI>in propria persona;</HI> the business of the day is a wedding, and Charles Dupeley is invited to see his friend, Sir Harry Grovebey, united to the most charming of her sex.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DUPELEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>The devil it is! What a young fellow of your hopes and fortune, sacrificed to a marriage of ro∣mance! But, prithee, relieve my impatience, and tell me who she is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>An orphan ward of the worthy old gentleman, at whose seat you now are: His character is sin∣gular, and as amiable in its way as her's. Inhe∣riting a great estate, and liberally educated, his
<PB N="3" REF="13"/>
disposition led him early to a country life, where his benevolence and hospitality are boundless; and these qualities, joined with an imagination bor∣dering upon the whimsical, have given a peculiar turn to the manners of the neighbourhood, that, in my opinion, degrades the polish of courts—but judge of the original.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter OLDWORTH.</STAGE>
<SP>
<P>Mr. Oldworth, I present you my friend; he is just arrived from abroad; I will not repeat how much he is worthy of your friendship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLDWORTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be worthy of your's, Sir Harry, is the best recommendation. <STAGE>(To Dupeley)</STAGE>—Sir, your friend is going to receive from my hands, a lovely girl, whose merit he has discern'd and lov'd for its own sake: Such nuptials should recal the ideas of a better age; he has permitted me to celebrate them upon my own plan, and I shall be happy to re∣ceive the judgement of an accomplish'd critic.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DUPELEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, by what I already see of Oldworth's Oaks, and know of the character of the master, I am persuaded the talent most necessary for the com∣pany will be that of giving due praise.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter HURRY.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HURRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, Sir, come down to the building directly—all the trades are together by the ears—it is for all the world like the tower of Babylon—they have drove a broad-wheel waggon over two hampers of wine, and it is all running among lilies and honey∣suckles
<PB N="4" REF="14"/>
—one of the cooks stumbled over one of the clouds, and threw a ham and chickens into a tub of white wash—a lamp-lighter spilt a gallon of oil into a cream'd apple-tart, and they have sent for more roses, and there is not one left with∣in twenty miles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLDWORTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, honest Hurry, if there is none to be had, you need not be in such haste about 'em—Mercy on us! my Fête has turn'd this poor fellow's head already, he will certainly get a fever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HURRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Get a favour, Sir!—why there has not been one left these three hours; all the girls in the parish have been scrambling for them, and I must get a hundred yards more—Lord a mercy! there is so much to do at once, and nobody to do it, that it is enough to moider one's head.</P>
<STAGE>(Oldworth and Hurry talk together.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DUPELEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha, is this one of the examples you pro∣duce, Sir Harry, to degrade the polish of courts?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I did, have you never met with a courtier in your travels, as busy, as important, and as insigni∣ficant, upon yet more trifling occasions?—Why, my friend Hurry's is the true bustle of an anti∣chamber, with this difference, that there is rather more attachment and fidelity to the master at the bottom of it.</P>
<STAGE>(During this speech Hurry is expressing by his action his impatience for Oldworth to go.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="15"/>
<SPEAKER>HURRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Law, Sir, if you loiter longer, I tell you they will all be at loggerheads—they were very near it when I came away.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLDWORTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Dupeley, you'll excuse me—Hurry con∣vinces me, my presence is necessary elsewhere—this is a busy day!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DUPELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>The greatest compliment you can pay me, is not not to look upon me as a stranger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLDWORTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>I forgot to tell you, Sir Harry, that Lady Bab Lardoon is in the neighbourhood, and I expect her every moment—she promised to be with us long before the hour of general invitation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DUPELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who is she, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, she's a superiour!—a phoenix!—more worthy your curiosity than any object of your travels!—She is an epitome, or rather a caricature of what is call'd <HI>very</HI> fine life, and the first female gamester of the time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLDWORTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>For all that, she is amiable—one cannot help discerning and admiring the natural excellence of her heart and understanding; though she is an example, that neither is proof against a false educa∣tion, and a rage for fashionable excesses—But when you see her, she will best explain herself—This fellow will give me no rest.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><PB N="6" REF="16"/>HURRY returns.</STAGE>
<SP>
<P>Rest, Sir, why I have not slept this fortnight; come along, Sir, pray make haste—nothing's to be done without it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLDWORTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor with it, honest Hurry.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit with Hurry.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DUPELEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>A cunning old fellow, I warrant!—with <HI>his ward and his love of merit for its own sake</HI>—ha, ha, ha!—pr'ythee how came your acquaintance in this odd family?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't sneer, and I will tell you—By mere chance' in a progress of amusement to this side the country: The story is too delicate for thy relish, suffice it that I came, saw, and lov'd—I laid my rank and fortune at the fair one's feet, and would have married instantly; but that Oldworth opposed my precipi∣tancy, and insisted upon a probation of six months absence—It has been a purgatory!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DUPELEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>All this is perfectly <HI>en regle</HI> for a man of home education—I should like to see the woman that could entangle <HI>me</HI> in this manner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is not a fellow in England has a more susceptible heart: You may have learnt in your foreign tour to disguise it, but if you have lost it, put all your acquisitions together, and the ballance will be against you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DUPELEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have learned at least, not to have it imposed upon: Shew me but a woman from an Italian
<PB N="7" REF="17"/>
Princess, to a figurante at the French opera; or change the scene, and carry me to the rural nymphs from a vintage in Burgundy, to a dance round a may-pole at Oldsworth's Oaks—and at the first glance I will discover the whole extent of their artifice, find their true lure, and bring them to my hand as easily as a tame sparrow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, my sagacious friend, upon what cir∣cumstances have you formed your suspicions that <HI>I</HI> am more likely to be impos'd upon than your∣self?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DUPELEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon every one I have seen and heard; but above all upon that natural propensity of every true home∣bred Englishman, to think one woman different from another—Now I hold there is but one woman in the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I perfectly agree, and Maria is that charming one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DUPELEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but Maria, and Lady Bab, and Pamela Andrews, and Clarissa Harlowe, and the girl that steals a heart in a country church, or she that picks your pocket in Covent-Garden, are one and the same creature for all that—I am always too quick for them, and make fools of them first—Oh do but try them by the principle I have laid down; you'll find them as transparent as glass.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>My own principle will answer my purpose just as well; with that perspective I have looked through
<PB N="8" REF="18"/>
the woman, and discovered the angel; and you will do the same when you see her, or never brag of your eye-sight more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DUPELEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rhapsody and enthusiasm!—I should as soon discover Mahomet's seventh heaven; but what says your uncle, old Groveby, to this match?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith I have asked him no questions, and why should I? when I know what must be his answer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DUPELEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, he can never disapprove a passion that soars above the stars!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has all the prejudices of his years, and wordly knowledge; the common old Gentleman's character—You may see it in every drama from the days of Terence, to those of Congreve; though not perhaps with quite so much good humour, and so little obstinacy as my Uncle shews. He is ever most impetuous, when most kind; and I dare trust his resentment will end with a dramatic forgiveness. Should it not, I may have pride in the sacrifice of his estate, but no regret.—So much for fortune, Charles—are there any other means to reconcile me to your approbation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DUPELEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Gad I know but one more—Have you laid any plan for succeeding at the divorce-shop next winter? It would be some comfort to your friends, to see you had a retreat in your head.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Charles, I have listened to your raillery with
<PB N="9" REF="19"/>
more patience than it deserves, and should at last be out of humour with such an importation of con∣ceit and affectation, if I was not sure your good sense would soon get the better of it. This is called knowing the world—to form notions without, per∣haps, ever seeing a man in his natural character, or conversing with a woman of principle: and then, for fear of being imposed upon, be really dup'd out of the most valuable feelings in human nature, confidence in friendship, and esteem in love.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter HURRY.</STAGE>
<SP>
<P>Lord, Sir, I am out of breath to find you, why almost every thing is ready, except yourself, and Madam Maria is gone to the Grove, and she is so dress'd, and looks so charming!</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Propitious be the hour!—here, Hurry, find out this Gentleman's servant, and shew him where he is to dress.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>DUPELEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, take care of yourself, Corydon, the first, I shall be time enough; Hurry shall first shew me a little of the preparation—what is going forward here? <STAGE>(Approaching the side scene.)</STAGE></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLDWORTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>You seem disconcerted, Maria, be more explicit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>My mind is incapable of reserve with you; the most generous of men, is on the point of giving his hand to your—what shall I call myself? I am almost nameless, but as the creature of your bounty and cares, this title gives me a value in my own eyes; but I fear it is all I have to boast. The mystery you have kept, makes me apprehensive there is something in my origin ought to be con∣cealed—what am I to interpret from your smiles?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLDWORTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every thing that is contrary to your surmises: be patient, sweet Maid of the Oaks; before night all mysteries shall be cleared. It is not an ordinary wedding I celebrate, I prepare a feast for the heart—Lady Bab Lardoon, as I live!—the princess of dissipation! catch an observation of her while you can, Maria; for though she has been but three days out of London, she is as uneasy as a mole in sun-shine, and would expire, if she did not soon dive into her old element again.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter Lady BAB.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BAB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Maria, I am happy to be the first of your company to congratulate you—well, Mr. Oldworth, I am delighted with the idea of your Féte; it is so novel, so French, so expressive of what every body
<PB N="19" REF="29"/>
understands, and nobody can explain; then there is something so spirited in an undertaking of ex¦pence, where a shower of rain would spoil it all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLDWORTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not expect to escape from so fine a lady, but you and the world have free leave to comment upon all you see here.</P>
<Q><HI>Laugh where you must, be candid where you can.</HI></Q>
<P>I only hope that to celebrate a joyful event upon any plan, that neither hurts the morals, or polite∣ness of the company, and at the same time sets thousands of the industrious to work, cannot be thought blame worthy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BAB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, quite the contrary, and I am sure it will have a run; a force upon the seasons and the man∣ners is the true test of a refined taste, and it holds good from a cucumber at Christmas, to an Italian opera.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is the rule the same among the ladies, lady Bab; is it also a definition of their refinement to act in all things contrary to nature?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BAB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not absolutely in all things, though more so than people are apt to imagine; for even in circum∣stances that seem most natural, fashion prompts ten times, where inclination prompts once; and there would be an end of gallantry in this country, if it was not for the sake of reputation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLDWORTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BAB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, that a woman without a connection,
<PB N="20" REF="30"/>
grows every day a more awkward personage; one might as well go into company without powder—if one does not <HI>really</HI> despise old vulgar prejudices, it is absolutely necessary to affect it, or one must sit at home alone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLDWORTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BAB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, like lady Sprose, and talk morals to the parrot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is new, indeed; I always supposed that in places where freedom of manners was most counte∣nanced, a woman of unimpeachable conduct carried a certain respect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BAB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only fit for sheep-walks and <HI>Oakeries!</HI>—I beg your pardon, Mr. Oldworth—in town it wou'd just raise you to the whist-party of old lady Cypher, Mrs. Squabble and lord Flimzey; and at every public place, you wou'd stand among the footmen to call your own chair, while all the maccaronies passed by, whistling a song through their tooth-picks, and giving a shrug—<HI>dem it, 'tis pity that so fine a woman shou'd be lost to all common decency.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA,</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(smiling)</STAGE> I believe I had better stay in the <HI>Oakery,</HI> as you call it; for I am afraid I shall never procure any <HI>civility</HI> in town, upon the terms required.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BAB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, my dear, you have chose a horrid word to express the intercourse of the bon ton; <HI>civility</HI> may be very proper in a mercer, when one is chusing a
<PB N="21" REF="31"/>
silk, but <HI>familiarity</HI> is the life of good company. I believe this is quite since your time Mr. Oldworth, but 'tis by far the greatest improve∣ment the beau monde ever made.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLDWORTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>A certain ease was always an essential part of good breeding, but lady Bab must explain her meaning a little further, before we can decide upon the improvement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BAB.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mean that participation of society, in which the French used to excel, and we have now so much outdone our models—I maintain, that among the <HI>superior</HI> set—mind, I only speak of them—our men and women are put more upon a footing together in London, than they ever were before in any age or country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLDWORTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray how has this happy resolution been effected?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BAB.</SPEAKER>
<P>By the most charming of all institutions, wherein we shew the world, that liberty is as well understood by our women as by our men; we have our <HI>Bill of Rights</HI> and our <HI>Constitution</HI> too, as well as they—we drop in at all hours, play at all parties, pay our own reckonings, and in every circumstance (pet∣ticoats excepted) are true lively jolly fellows.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>But does not this give occasion to a thousand malicious insinuations?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BAB.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Ten</HI> thousand, my dear—but no <HI>great measures</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="32"/>
can be effected without a contempt of popular clamour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLDWORTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Paying of reckonings is I confess new since my time; and I should be afraid it might sometimes be a little heavy upon a lady's pocket.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BAB.</SPEAKER>
<P>A mere trifle—one generally wins them—Jack Saunter of the guards, lost a hundred and thirty to me upon score at one time; I have not eat him half out yet—he will keep me best part of next winter; but exclusive of that, the club is the greatest system of oeconomy for married families, ever yet established.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLDWORTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! but how so, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BAB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, all the servants may be put to board wages, or sent into the country, except the foot∣men—no plunder of house-keepers, or maitres de hotel, no long butcher's bills—Lady Squander pro∣tests she has wanted no provision in her family these six months, except potatoes to feed the chil∣dren, and a few frogs for the French governess—then our dinner-societies are so amusing, all the doves and hawks together, and one converses so freely; there's no topick of White's or Almack's, in which we do not bear a part.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word I should be a little afraid, that some of those subjects might not always be managed with sufficient delicacy for a lady's ear, especially an unmarried one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="23" REF="33"/>
<SPEAKER>Lady BAB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bless me! why where's the difference? Miss must have had a strange education indeed, not to know as much as her Chapron: I hope you would not have the daughters black-ball'd, when the mothers are chose: Why it is almost the only place where some of them are likely to see each other.</P>

<PB N="24" REF="34"/>
plague a man, and to bury him; the glory is to plague him first, and <HI>bury him</HI> afterwards.</P>

<P>Lord, a great while, and in all its stages: They first began with a modest inuendo, "<HI>we hear a certain Lady, not a hundred miles from Hanoversquare, lost, at one sitting, some nights ago, two thousund guineas</HI>—O tempora! O mores!"</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLDWORTH,</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(laughing)</STAGE> Pray, Lady Bab, is this concluding ejaculation your own, or was it the Printer's?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BAB.</SPEAKER>
<P>His, you may be sure; a dab of Latin adds sur∣prizing force to a paragraph, besides shewing the learning of the author.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLDWORTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but really I don't see such a great matter in this; why should you suppose any body applied this paragraph to you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BAB.</SPEAKER>
<P>None but my intimates did, for it was applicable to half St. George's parish; but about a week after they honoured me with initials and italicks: "It is said, Lady B. L's ill success still continues at the quinze table: it was observed, the same Lady ap∣peared yesterday at court, in a <HI>ribband collier,</HI> hav∣ing laid aside her <HI>diamond</HI> necklace, (diamond in italicks) as totally bourgeoise and unnecessary for the dress of a woman of fashion."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLDWORTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure this <HI>was</HI> advancing a little in <HI>fami∣liarity.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BAB.</SPEAKER>
<P>At last, to my infinite amusement, out I came at full length: "<HI>Lady Bab. Lardoon has tumbled down</HI>

<HI>three nights successively; a certain colonel has done the same, and we hear that both parties keep house with sprained ancles.</HI>"</P>

<P>The very same; but I'm afraid he will never do, he is but half a maccaroni.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lady Bab, I wish you would undertake him; he seems to have contracted all the common-place affectation of travel, and thinks himself quite an

<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is only gone to dress; I appointed to meet him on the other side the Grove; he'll be here in twenty minutes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BAB.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll attend him there in your place—I have it—I'll try my hand a little at <HI>naivetè</HI>—he never saw me—the dress I am going to put on for the Fête will do admirably to impose upon him: I'll make an example of his hypocrisy, and his <HI>graces,</HI> and his <HI>usage du monde.</HI></P>

<P>My life for it he will begin an acquaintance with you.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BAB.</SPEAKER>
<P>If he don't, I'll begin with him: There are two characters, under which one may say any thing to a man; that of perfect assurance, and of perfect innocence: Maria may be the best critick of the last; but under the <HI>appearance</HI> of it, lord have mercy!—I have heard and seen such things!</P>

<P>Why, you are satirical, my fairest; and have you heard any thing else of fine gentlemen?</P>

<P>Yes, a great deal more—That they take wives for fortunes, and mistresses for shew; squander their money among taylors, barbers, cooks, and fidlers;

pawn their honour to sharpers, and their estates to Jews; and at last run to foreign countries to repair a pale face, a flimzy carcase, and an empty pocket—that's a fine gentleman for you!</P>

<P><STAGE>(Still suspicious.)</STAGE> And pray, my sweet Philly, where did you learn this character of a fine gentleman?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BAB.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, I learnt it with my catechism—Mr. Oldworth has it taught to all the young maidens here about.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DUPELEY.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE> O, the glutton!—have I found at last the <HI>clue</HI>—I'll be hang'd if old sly-boots has not a rural seraglio, and this is the favourite sultana!</P>

<SPEAKER>DUPELEY.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(significantly.)</STAGE> So it is from Mr. Oldworth, is it, my charming <HI>innocence,</HI> that you have learnt to be so much afraid of fine gentlemen?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BAB.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, not at all afraid; I believe you are perfectly harmless if one treats you right, as I do our young mastiff at home.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DUPELEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how is that, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BAB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, while one keeps at a distance, he frisks, and he flies, and he barks, and tears, and grumbles, and makes a sad rout about it—Lord you'd think he would devour one at a mouthful! but if one does but walk boldly up and look him in the face, and ask him what he wants, he drops his ears and runs away directly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DUPELEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well said, rural simplicity again!—Oh damn it, I need not be so squeamish here!—Well but, my dear heavenly creature, don't commit such a sin, as to waste your youth, and your charms upon a set of rusticks here; fly with me to the true region of plea∣sure—my chaise and four shall be ready at the back gate of the park, and we will take the opportunity, when all the servants are drunk, as they certainly will be, and the company is gone tired to bed.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DUPELEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lady Bab Lardoon, indeed!—Oh, you have named a special object for a passion—I should as soon be in love with the figure of the Great Mogul at the back of a pack of cards—If <HI>she</HI> has any thing to do with <HI>hearts,</HI> it must be when they are trumps, and she pulls them out of her pocket—No, sweet Philly; thank heaven that gave me insight into the sex, and reserv'd me for a woman in her native charms—here alone she is to be found, and paradise is on her lips! <STAGE>(struggling to kiss her.)</STAGE> Thus let me thank you for my nosegay.</P>

<SPEAKER>OLDWORTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Excuse me, brother, Madam, all—my story is very short, Maria; the hour of your birth made <HI>me</HI> a widower, and <HI>you</HI> a splendid heiress; I trembled at the dangers of that situation, made more dangerous by the loss of your mother—to be the object of flat∣tery, in the very cradle, and made a prey to interest is the common lot attending it—These reflections, call them whim, call them singularities, what you please, induced me to conceal your birth; being abroad at the time, the plan was easily executed.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>How blind have I been? Benevolent as you are to all, I might still have perceived and interpreted the dis∣tinction of your unremitting tenderness—how could I mistake the parent's partiality, the parent's fondness?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLDWORTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your happiness has been the motive of my actions, be it my excuse—The design has answered wonder∣fully—for though Maria's virtues would have found their lustre under any tryal, there would have wanted the humble station of the Maid of the Oaks to give her due proof of a disinterested lover.</P>
