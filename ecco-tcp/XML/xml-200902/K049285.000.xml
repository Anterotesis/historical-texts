<L>Th' advice is good; the question only, whether</L>

The person here meant, having actually laid upwards of forty eggs, as several physicians and fellows of the r-y-l s-ci-ty can attest; one of whom (we hear) has undertaken the incubation, and will (no doubt) favour the world with an account of his success. Some virtuosi affirm, that such productions must be the effect of a certain intercourse of organs, not fit to be named.</NOTE></L>
<L N="30">Or rapt amidst the transports of a drum;<NOTE PLACE="foot"><L>30. <HI>Transports of a drum;</HI>]</L> This is a riotous assembly of fashionable people, of both sexes, at a private house, consisting of some hundreds; not unaptly stiled a drum, from the noise and em∣ptiness of the Entertainment.
