<P>Why, Ned, I have some notion—but to give you a simile in your own way—the old black

<P>The first time I saw my charmer, she was engaged in a wrangle with her guardian at the gate of the—Museum—in—a—Leicester-fields.</P>

<P>Leicester-fields! Oh, ho! <STAGE>(aside.)</STAGE></P>

<SPEAKER>Larry.</SPEAKER>
<P>She would see the butterflies, ha, ha, ha! He in a rage slapping his cane on a show-glass of watch-strings, seals, and sleeve-buttons—cries, "Zounds, it's half-a-crown"—<Q>The exact price of that pane,</Q> says the man of the shop—"Jack, fetch the glazier"—The expence of this accident determined the affair; and the generous attorney, instead of Sir Ashton's, proposing a trudge to Don Saltero's, I whip'd in a hack before them to Chelsea—Returning home, down comes an auspicious shower, and, to save eighteen-pence, Alibi accepts of part of my coach.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Airc.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, your own hack, Ha, ha, ha!—Yes, this is Sophia's monstrous fool <STAGE>(aside).</STAGE></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Airc.</SPEAKER>
<P><Q>To Capias Alibi, Esquire—Dear Sir, the bearer is a young man from Yorkshire, being desirous to improve himself in the profes∣sion of an attorney, I recommend him to you; and think a dealing in this case will be to the advantage of both. Yours, Nol Pross,</Q>—Well, what of this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
<SPEAKER>Larry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha! Can't you see? <HI>That,</HI> I procured for a little cash, of a brother rogue of Alibi's—I deliver it—it gains me free access to Sophia; of which, if I don't avail myself—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Airc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Must turn him off from this <STAGE>(aside).</STAGE> Won't Alibi remember you in the Chelsea shower? Ha, ha, ha! won't he?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Larry.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, he won't; ha, ha, ha! <STAGE>(mimicking.)</STAGE> For, to get the worth of his money in gaping about, he scarce look'd at me at Don Saltero's—And then, to face my charming Sophia, I sat beside him in the coach; besides, I shall change my voice; and, to provide for that, I've made Nol say I am from Yorkshire—Oh, you'd laugh to see—I shall be clerkified all over <STAGE>(displays his dress)</STAGE>.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Airc.</SPEAKER>
<P>But really now, do you think old Alibi is such a blockhead as not to perceive from your air, person, address—the fashion that is in your manner altogether! What! take you for a sordid, shabby Cursitor-street ramskin scribbler? Ha, ha, ha! never! The gentleman in your coat wou'd belie Nol Pross's letter, and get you and it kicked out of the house, to the eternal disgrace of St. James's, and the triumph of Chancery-lane.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Larry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Egad, Aircourt, I believe you're right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Airc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Depend upon't, the old attorney wou'd perceive the diamond, though set in copper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Larry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hang it! this air of travel which we ac∣quire abroad—I wish I wasn't so—elegant in my manière—I wish I had a little of the common—vulgar—Now you, Aircourt, how natural you'd look the ramskin scribbler!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Airc.</SPEAKER>
<P>D'ye think so? you flatter me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Larry.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, you'd top the character!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Airc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, dem'me, I'll appear in it. I will secure this letter—that will do—and for change of
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
dress, Ned the Waiter will equip me! <STAGE>(aside.)</STAGE> Zounds, it is two o'clock! but I can get to Drury∣lane by the second act.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Larry.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Sdeath! don't think of town or play∣houses to-night!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Airc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her Calista is one of the most capital—When she tears the letter—<Q>To atoms thus let me tear the wicked, lying evidence of shame</Q>— <STAGE><HI>(having, unseen, put</HI> LARRY's letter in his pocket, tears another).</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Larry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, zounds, you've torn my letter!</P>

<P>And then her smile of contempt upon Horatio, after—</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Larry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Damn you and Horatio, Sir! D'ye see what you've done? Knock'd up my whole affair!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Airc.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Pon my soul I ask pardon—I did not think what I was about.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Larry.</SPEAKER>
<P>The devil! What am I to do now? This is cruel of you, Aircourt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Airc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, O'Donovan, though I've destroyed your passport, no harm done. For any project to gain Sophia, I'm yours—from a spank to Scot∣land, burning old Alibi's house, or any mischief of that sort.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Larry.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Aircourt, I thank you heartily—I'll go dress, and then for Lady Arable's, a charm∣ing young widow here at Hampton Court—Has been over in Ireland to view some of her estates there, and my father has squir'd her back again—Designs her as a match for me—Ha, ha, ha!. Rather a nice thing to match me, Eh, Aircourt?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Airc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; but I think I'll match you, ha, ha, ha!</P>

<P>My father don't know I have been five months diverting myself in England under an assumed name—Dad thinks I'm still on my Italian

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Airc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Plague of your frolicks! <STAGE>(aside.)</STAGE>—Sophia, perhaps, is at home now?—That is—he keeps her close.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Larry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Close! she saves him the expence of a clerk. But, Aircourt, don't think of London to∣night.</P>

<P>Well, I won't.</P>

<P>To be sure! Beat! Why, I have made 50 <HI>l.</HI> out of the wag of a finger, and have earned a hundred guineas of a morning, only by single tweaks by the nose.—Now, Miss, have you drawn up the bill of indictment? Egad! child, you'll have no use for your fortune! By the Lord! you'll make a choice chamber counsel.— <STAGE>(Reads)</STAGE> <Q>Parish aforesaid—county aforesaid—did make an assault upon one—and did then and there beat, wound, and cruelly illtreat—against the peace of our sovereign lord the king—But of all the fine wrestlers that dance on the green, young Harry's the lad for me!</Q>—Oh, the devil! here's a bill of indictment to come before a grand jury!—So, the exciseman breaks my head with his gauging stick, and then <Q>Young Harry's the lad for me!</Q></P>
