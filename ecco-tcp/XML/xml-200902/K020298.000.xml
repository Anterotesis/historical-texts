<P>AS the OLD MAID is now adven∣turing into the world, it would be proper to acquaint the mere English reader, that the subject of it, and part of the fable, were taken from a <HI>little piece,</HI> in one act, called, <HI>L'Etourderie,</HI> by Monsieur <HI>Fagan.</HI> but that the author of these scenes is sensible, how superfluous that information will be rendered by the assiduity of some people, who, no doubt, will make a notable discovery of this prodigious crime, and press it home with all the reproaches of <HI>plagiarism, pilfer∣ing, borrowing, robbing, translating,</HI> &amp;c. But while this writer can add any thing to the decent amusements of the public, he is willing to be abused for it, in what∣ever manner the illiberal shall think fit.</P>

<P>Oh! ma'am, I beg your pardon if I have taken too much liberty for your good—</P>

<P>I humbly thank you for your advice, my sweet dear, friendly sister—But don't envy me, I beg you won't;—don't fret your∣self; you can't conceive what a deal of good a serenity of mind will do your health—I'll go and write an answer directly to this charming, charming letter—sister—yours—I shall be glad to see you, sister, at my house in Hill-street, when I am Mrs. Clerimont—and remember what I tell you—that some faces retain their bloom and beauty longer than you imagine—my dear sister—Come, Trifle—let me fly this moment—Sister, your servant.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. HARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>No—not I—I wish she may be married to one or other of them—for her temper is really grown so very sour, and there is such eternal wrangling between ye both, that I wish to see her in her own house, for the peace and quiet of mine.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLERIMONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>The first time I saw her was a few nights ago at Ranelagh—Though there was a crowd of beauties in the room, thronging and pressing all around, yet she shone amongst them all with superior lustre—She was walk∣ing arm in arm with another lady—no op∣portunity offered for me to form an acquain∣tance amidst the hurry and bustle of the place, but I enquired their names as they were going into their chariot—and learned they were Mrs. and Miss HARLOW. From that moment she won my heart, and at one glance I became the willing captive of her beauty—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. HARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very candid declaration, Sir!—how can this be? The bloom has been off the peach any time these fifteen years, to my

<P>A favourable eye!—He must greatly want discernment, who has not a quick per∣ception of her merit.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. HARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>You do her a great deal of honour—but this affair—is it not somewhat sudden, Sir?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLERIMONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant it—you may indeed be surprised at it, Sir; nor should I have been hardy enough to make any overtures to you,—at least yet a while,—if she herself had not condescended to listen to my passion, and au∣thorised me under her own fair hand to ap∣ply to her brother for his consent—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. HARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall be very ready, Sir, to give my ap∣probation to my sister's happiness—</P>

<P>No doubt you will—but let me not cherish an unavailing flame, a flame that al∣ready lights up all my tenderest passions.</P>

<P>To you, Sir, there can be no exception—I am not altogether a stranger to your fa∣mily and fortune—His language is warm, considering my sister's age—but I won't hurt her preferment— <STAGE>(aside)</STAGE>—you will pardon me, Sir, one thing—you are very young—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord! lord! have I been made a fool of all this time!—furies! torture! murder!—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. CAPE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha!—my lady fair is taken in, I think—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sister, the men don't see with my eyes—ha! ha!</P>

<SPEAKER>Capt. CAPE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! the gentleman is no dangler, ma'am.—</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is a complete conquest my sister has made—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't bear this—Sir, I desire I may not be made a jest of—did not you sollicit me?—importune me?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLERIMONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>For your interest in that lady, ma'am,—whom I took for Miss Harlow—I beg your

pardon if I am mistaken,—I hope there is no harm done.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, but there is harm done—I am made sport of—exposed to derision—Oh! I cannot bear this—I cannot bear it—</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>(cries.)</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't cry, sister—some faces preserve the bloom longer than others you know—ha! ha!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. CAPE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Loll toll loll—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HEARTWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't understand all this—is that lady your wife, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. HARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HEARTWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, nephew—you took that lady for Mr. Harlow's sister, I suppose—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLERIMONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did, Sir.—I beg pardon for the trouble I have given—I am in such confusion, I can hardly—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HEARTWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well! the thing is cleared up, and there is no harm done—but you should have known what ground you went upon—ha! ha! I can't help laughing neither—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. HARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why faith, nor I—ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLERIMONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Since matters have turned so unexpected∣ly, I beg pardon for my mistake, and Sir, I take my leave—</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>(going.)</STAGE>
<SP>
<PB N="53" REF="56"/>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>And will you treat me in this manner, Sir? will you draw me into such a scrape, and not—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLERIMONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ma'am, that gentleman would cut my throat—his claim is prior to mine—and, I dare say, he will be very glad to be reconciled, madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are a base man then, and I reject you—Capt. Cape I see my error, Sir, and I resign myself to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. CAPE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, madam, I beg to be excused—I have been a dangler too long—I ought to have been a brisker lover—I shall endeavour to survive it, ma'am—I won't do myself a mis∣chief—and I have my answer—I am off, madam—loll toll loll—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! I told you this, my dear sister—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLERIMONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, I dare say the gentleman will think better of it—Mr. Harlow, I am sorry for all this confusion, and I beg pardon of the whole company for my mistake—Mrs. Harlow, I wish you all happiness, ma'am—angelic creature!—what a misfortune to lose her!—</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Bows and exit.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. CAPE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I will follow his example—Miss Har∣low I wish you all happiness,—angelic crea∣ture! what a misfortune to lose her!—upon my soul I think you a most admirable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and so now you may go, and bewail your virgi∣nity in the mountains—loll toll loll—</P>

<SPEAKER>Miss HARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! oh! I can't bear to be treated in this manner—I'll go and hide myself from the world for ever—Oh! oh!—the men are all savages, barbarians, monsters, and I hate the whole sex—Oh! oh!—</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>(cries bitterly,) Exit.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear sister, with her beauty and her conquests, ha! ha!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. HARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! very whimsical and ridiculous—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HEARTWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, my nephew is young—I am sorry for this scene of errors, and I hope you will ascribe the whole to his inexperience—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. HARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>I certainly shall, Sir—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cautioned my sister sufficiently about this matter, but vanity got the better of her, and leaves her now a whimsical instance of folly and affectation.</P>
<L>In vain the FADED TOAST her mirror tries,</L>
<L>And counts the cruel murders of her eyes;</L>
<L>For ridicule, fly-peeping o'er her head,</L>
<L>Will point the roses and the lillies dead;</L>
<L>And while, fond soul! she weaves her myrtle chain,</L>
<L>She proves a subject of the comic strain.</L>
