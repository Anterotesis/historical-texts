<P>MARGARET OF ANJOU, AN HISTORICAL INTERLUDE.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="note">
<PB REF="3"/>
<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS historical Interlude is form'd upon the same plan that ROUSSEAU composed his <HI>Pygmalion,</HI> which is a new species of drama∣tic Entertainment, consisting of a Monologue that is often suspended by the interposition of Music, which must sympathise with the passions and feel∣ings of the personage who is supposed to speak.</P>
<P>The following little drama was perform'd by Miss YOUNGE on her benefit night, and received from that celebrated actress all the spirit and co∣louring that excellence of acting can give. The
<PB N="vi" REF="4"/>music (the composition of Mr. HOOK) was hap∣pily adapted to the tendency of the poem.</P>
<P>The subject is taken from a remakable incident in the life of MARGARET. That unfortunate QUEEN flying with her Son <Q>into a forest after the Battle of <HI>Hexbam,</HI> saw a robber approach with his naked sword, and finding that she had no means of escape, she suddenly embrac'd the re∣solution of trusting entirely for protection to his generosity. The man whose humanity and ge∣nerous spirit had been obscured, not entirely lost by his vicious course of life, was struck with the singularity of the event, and charmed with
<PB N="vii" REF="5"/>the confidence reposed in him, and he vow'd not only to abstain from all injury against the Queen, but to devote himself intirely to her safety and protection.

<LG>
<L>THE fierce pursuers will not here perchance</L>
<L>Discover us: the thick-inwoven umbrage</L>
<L>Of these gigantic trees will spread concealment:</L>
<L>Yet as their solemn branches wave; strange fear</L>
<L>Possesses me: yet all is still as night.</L>
<L>No thund'ring tread of horsemen arm'd, no quick</L>
<L>Approaching footsteps rush upon my ear.</L>
<L>The shourts of rebel victory are lost</L>
<L>And fade away, ere they can pierce these shades:</L>
<L>Ah what a victory! He whose meek sway</L>
<L>Solicited his people's grateful love,</L>
<L>My Henry! England's monarch fail'd, and at</L>
<L>The dying groan of stern defeat, that panted</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="7"/>
Still for conquest, he too sure expired:</L>
<L>While I, a wretched outcast of the throne,</L>
<L>Rove desolate amid these savage walks,</L>
<L>Of ev'ry comfort, ev'ry hope bereft:</L>
<STAGE>(To her Child)</STAGE>
<L>But thou, my Edward, still art mine! ah lay</L>
<L>Thy weary limbs on yonder bank, and I</L>

<L>He sleeps unconscious of the dire distress</L>
<L>That hovers o'er his head, kind Ignorance</L>
<L>That drops her veil before his infant eyes:</L>
<L>Yet as he blossoms into youth, the hand</L>
<L>Of Time with-drawing back the veil, shall for</L>
<L>The radiant prospect he this morn was heir to</L>
<L>Shall offer to his view a throne o'erturn'd</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="8"/>
And floating in the blood of all his friends:</L>
<L>Ah what a sight! it urges me to madness.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet all that courage cou'd effect was done:</L>
<L>When wild Dissension her torn banners rear'd,</L>
<L>Which insolently wav'd o'er Henry's head</L>
<L>While he beneath their shade a captive stood,</L>
<L>I, feeble agent, hurried to the field,</L>
<L>And at that moment losing all the fears</L>
<L>That haunt the female breast, I call'd to loyalty</L>
<L>To snatch my Henry from Rebellion's arm:</L>
<L>The valiant troops who then encircled me</L>
<L>On Wakefield's day perform'd their duty well,</L>
<L>And on St. Alban's memorable plain</L>
<L>I saw defeated Warwick wing his flight</L>
<L>And rescued Henry hasten to these arms.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="9"/>
<L>Yet what avail these momentary triumphs!</L>
<L>Ev'n while I speak perchance my Henry lies</L>
<L>Extended on the plain, deform'd with wounds,</L>
<L>While o'er his sacred corse the hostile band</L>
<L>Irreverently pass, and with vile taunts</L>
<L>Upbraid his overthrow: nor was I present</L>
<L>To solace his last moments, catch the accents</L>
<L>Of his departing voice, and close his fading eyes.</L>

<L>With all the horrors of descending night,</L>

<L>Dare I confide my son? Shou'd he be torn</L>

<L>AS Echo's voice returns the pleasing lay,</L>
<L>So is a Dream the Echo of the day:</L>
<L>The busy thoughts that round some object teem</L>
<L>Oft join in sleep to form the nightly theme,</L>
<L>Then bright-ey'd Fancy lifts her magic wand</L>
<L>While scenes unreal rise at her command:</L>
<L>Then Comedy, with all her laughing train</L>
<L>Straight issues from the porch of Comus' fane,</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="19"/>
And bringing with her all her pleasing wiles,</L>
<L>Her pranks, her gambols, and her winning smiles,</L>

<L>Ye lovers answer to the truth I sing;</L>
<L>Say, does not Fancy to your stumber bring,</L>

<L>Sometimes a dream anticipates the date,</L>
<L>Comes as a prophet to reveal our fate:</L>
<L>And thus, ere Yorick sunk into the tomb,</L>
<L>The Priest of sentiment foresaw his doom:</L>
<L>'Twas night—his solitary couch he press'd,</L>
<L>Till sorrow▪worn he wearied into rest;</L>
<L>Eliza then soft-gliding on his view,</L>
<L>Thus o'er his slumber breath'd her sad adieu:</L>
<L>'Oh thou my guardian, confident, and friend,</L>

<L>'No longer now the gift of Health implore,</L>
<L>'The curtain drops, and thy short scene is o'er;</L>
<L>'Yet ere thy feeling spirit takes its flight,</L>

<L>This visionary scene she then reveal'd:</L>
<L>Methought, encompass' d by a brilliant train,</L>
<L>I reach'd the steps of bright Minerva's fane;</L>
<L>Full in the midst a mystic vase I view'd,</L>
<L>Round which the Muses new-blown flow'rets strew'd:</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="22"/>
Arm'd with the lyre I saw a youthful band</L>
<L>Who wak'd the sounding chords, with skillful hand:</L>
<L>Unnumber'd beauties silent stood around,</L>
<L>Who grac'd as softer priests the hallow'd ground:</L>
<L>There Virtue wore her most attractive mein,</L>
<L>And in the form of Marlborough was seen.</L>
<L>The Graces, skill'd the cultur'd mind to win,</L>
<L>Knock'd at the door, and Bamfylde let them in.</L>
<L>This visionary scene by Fancy bred,</L>
<L>Remov'd, and thro' the gates of morning fled.</L>

<L>That down the silver Cydnus row'd,</L>
<L><PB N="31" REF="34"/>
Beneath whose purple sails were seen,</L>
<L>Proud Ostentiation's gaudy Queen,</L>
<L>Who sure of conquest, vain of mind,</L>
<L>All languishingly lay reclined!</L>
<L>Here Beauty undefil'd by art,</L>
<L>Whose bosom own'd a tender heart,</L>
<L>Beneath the sails from home remov'd,</L>
<L>And trusted to the man she lov'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A soothing calmness lull'd the deep,</L>
<L>And hush'd each wavy surge to sleep:</L>
<L>The air along the sultry day,</L>
<L>Scorch'd by the summer's fervent ray,</L>
<L>Was freshen'd by a recent show'r,</L>
<L>While Silence solemniz'd the hour.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The still solemnity impress'd</L>
<L>With awful thoughts CAMILLA'S breast,</L>
<L><PB N="32" REF="35"/>
For now by prompting Love impell'd,</L>
<L>Now by Timidity witheld,</L>
<L>The words which to pronounce she tried,</L>
<L>Recoil'd, and unaccented died.</L>
<L>PLACENTO too alike subdued,</L>
<L>They sail'd along in silent mood,</L>
<L>And stillness reign'd from shore to shore,</L>
<L>Unbroke—but by the dashing oar.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At length the fair dissolv'd the charm—</L>
<L>'Ah, wonder not I feel alarm!</L>
<L>'Confiding in thy love I came,</L>
<L>'And risk'd for thee my virgin fame:</L>
<L>'Ah tell me to what place we sail,</L>
<L>'For in my bosom fears prevail:</L>
<L>'Yet answer not this idle fear,</L>
<L>'Where'er thou art bright Honour's there'.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="33" REF="36"/>
<L>'The plan I form, the youth replied</L>
<L>'To Innocence is close allied</L>
<L>'And fearful of thy virgin fame</L>
<L>'As of her babe the tender dame.</L>
<L>'These waves that wander to the sea</L>
<L>'Wash in their pilgrimage a tree,</L>
<L>'Which spreads its lowly branches wide,</L>
<L>'And dips them in the passing tide:</L>
<L>'There, in a shed compos'd of reeds,</L>
<L>'An aged hermit tells his beads:</L>
<L>'He, gen'rous sage, will join our hands</L>
<L>'In wedlock's unremitting bands.</L>
<L>'Then to VALCLUSA we'll repair,</L>
<L>'Where LAURA's soul informs the air:</L>
<L>'Where PETRARCH's spirit hovers round,</L>
<L>'The guardian of the sacred ground,</L>
<L><PB N="34" REF="37"/>
Forbidding still that fiend of art,</L>
<L>'That shrewd perverter of the heart,</L>
<L>'The snake, Inconstancy, to rove</L>
<L>'Within the paradise of Love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'As when chill Winter quits the land,</L>
<L>'The snow-drop does her leaves expand,</L>
<L>'So may chill fears your breast release,</L>
<L>'Till gently it expands to peace,</L>
<L>'Mild as these twilight breezes blow,</L>
<L>'Soft as the waves on which we flow.'</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Ye walls where first I drew the air,</L>
<L>'Return'd (assur'd) the beauteous fair;</L>
<L>'Ye turrets which but dimly seen</L>
<L>'Encrease the terrour of the scene!</L>
<L>'Ye stately tow'rs! and rising spires!</L>
<L>'From you CAMILLA now retires.</L>

<L>'Thou tomb whose pious urn contains</L>

<L>'Well for PLACENTIO all are lost.</L>

<L>She ceas'd—and on her pensive soul</L>
<L>Agian an awful musing stole,</L>
<L>Such as the twilight scene excites,</L>
<L>Such as the feeling heart delights;</L>
<L>For as the coy nocturnal flow'r <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The night-smelling Geranium.</NOTE></L>

<L>See now they reach the sacred cell</L>
<L>Where Wisdom, Peace, and Virtue dwell:</L>
<L>There, bent beneath the weight of age,</L>
<L>They find prepar'd th' expecting sage.</L>
<L>He hail'd them in a friendly tone,</L>
<L>And bade them call his cell their own:</L>
<L>Where rose an altar form'd of moss,</L>
<L>Crown'd with a simple wooden cross!</L>

<L>Supplied a pompous glare of light:</L>

<L>This humble low-roof'd temple grac'd.</L>
<L>But flow'rets from the neighb'ring wood,</L>
<L>The unambitious altar strew'd:</L>
<L>For incense they exhal'd perfume,</L>
<L>For ornament they gave their bloom.</L>
<L>The hermit spoke—'Hail virtuous pair,</L>
<L>May sorrow now your bosom spare:</L>
<L><PB N="37" REF="40"/>
'Tho' youth be yours, yet well I know</L>
<L>'You've tasted deep of human woe!</L>

<L>See now the youthful pair unite,</L>
<L>To meet the hymeneal rite:</L>

<L>At length the hermit joins their hands</L>
<L>In willing and unvenal bands,</L>

<HEAD>THE MEXICAN FRIENDS. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The sublime instance of heroic friendship that forms the subject of this poem, is recorded by ANTONIO DE SOLIS in his History of the conquest of Mexico. This is an Episode of a more extensive poem, and being the part that was the most favourably receiv'd, I am not unwilling to sacrisice a few pages for the sake of rendering my poetical offerings more acceptable to the public.</NOTE></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>SEE to the fane HISPANIA'S troops repair,</L>
<L>Whose high ascending tow'rs are lost in air:</L>
<L>From whence the MEXICANS with speedy art</L>
<L>Show'r on the foe the death-inflicting dart:</L>
<L>Yet then by CORTEZ led, still undismay'd,</L>
<L>The SPANIARD host the losty fane invade.</L>
<L><PB N="39" REF="42"/>
Two valiant youths (whom friendship's holy hand,</L>
<L>Had join'd with her indissoluble band)</L>
<L>Beheld indignant, smit with patriot grief,</L>
<L>The great achievements of the hostile chief:</L>
<L>And now JANELLAN thus accosts his friend:</L>
<L>'Firm to no purpose, active to no end,</L>
<L>'See from our gallant men you hallow'd tow'r</L>
<L>'Already ravish'd by th' invading pow'r:</L>
<L>'Must this, committed to our mutual care,</L>
<L>'The same defeat, the same dishonour share?</L>
<L>'If so—the victor shall not long survive—</L>
<L>'A thought that bids my fading hope revive:</L>
<L>'A thought—that like the thunder-flash of night</L>
<L>'Darts on my darken'd mind a radiant light—</L>
<L>'But ere my veil'd designment I unfold,</L>
<L>'Declare, however rash, however bold,</L>
<L><PB N="40" REF="43"/>
'Thou'lt not o'ershade with Caution's chill con∣troul,</L>
<L>'The warm, the splendid purpose of my soul.'</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>VENZULA to his breast his hand applied,</L>
<L>And thus beyond the pow'r of words replied.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The youth resum'd—'From this aerial height,</L>
<L>'Bid thy bold vision take its deepest flight,</L>
<L>'Down to you rock, far stretching o'er the shore,</L>
<L>'Gainst which the raging waves incessant roar,</L>
<L>'Whose clashing voices into stillness fade,</L>
<L>'Ere this tremendous distance they pervade:</L>
<L>'If Fortune bless what my proud counsels urge,</L>
<L>'Yon waves shall murmur soon the victor's dirge!</L>
<L>'My secret project I will now unveil:</L>
<L>'Should CORTEZ o'er this valiant band prevail,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="41" REF="44"/>
<L>'Should thro' controulment, and thro' stubborn force,</L>
<L>'Pour like a torrent his destructive course,</L>
<L>'When on this summit first he shall appear,</L>
<L>'I will advance, with well-dissembled fear,</L>
<L>'And, suppliant as I kneel to win his grace,</L>
<L>'I'll dauntless lock him in a stern embrace,</L>
<L>'Bear him reluctant to you giddy steep,</L>
<L>'Where yawns a dreadful opening to the deep,</L>
<L>'And thence—self-ruin'd for my country's good,</L>
<L>'Plunge with her foe into the whelming flood!'</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>VENZULA answered—'Yes, I much admire</L>
<L>'What now thy matchless virtue dares inspire:</L>
<L>'But wilt thou, with an avarice of fame,</L>
<L>'The meed of Glory all exclusive claim?</L>
<L>'Wilt thou to perils close to Death adjoin'd</L>
<L>'Advance, and leave thy fathful Friend behind?</L>
<L><PB N="42" REF="45"/>
'In infancy we shar'd the glitt'ring toys,</L>
<L>'And in one circle play'd our harmless joys:</L>
<L>'And when we quitted childhood's lowly vale,</L>
<L>'Where springing flow'rets scent the playful gale,</L>
<L>'Still hand in hand we climb'd youth's arduous height,</L>
<L>'Whence greater scences expanded on the sight,</L>
<L>'Still our pursuits consenting to one plan,</L>
<L>'Like wedded streams our lives united ran:</L>
<L>'And wilt thou now oppose the sacred tide,</L>
<L>'And bid the friendly waves disparting glide?'</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>JANELLAN spoke—'Endearing youth forgive:</L>
<L>'The conq'ror of some future CORTEZ live!</L>
<L>'Nor mark my fall with Grief's dejected brow,</L>
<L>'View from my death the bright effects that flow:</L>
<L>'Behold the tomb that Gratitude shall raise,</L>
<L>'Illustrious signal of my country's praise.'</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="43" REF="46"/>
<L>To this the brave VENZULA made reply,</L>
<L>And as he spoke, tears started from his eye:</L>
<L>'What tho' Felicity thy gift shall stream</L>
<L>'Sunlike o'er MEXICO with brighrest beam,</L>
<L>'Not all the splendour that her rays impart,</L>
<L>'Will e'er illumine my benighted heart,</L>
<L>'When destitute of thee, its only ray,</L>
<L>'Without the hope of kind returning day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Yet then to this great argument adjoin'd</L>
<L>'Sublimer motives urge my steady mind:</L>
<L>'Recall, recall that joy-diffusing hour,</L>
<L>'When gay Prosperity adorn'd my bow'r,</L>
<L>'As thy fair sister, half-afraid to speak,</L>
<L>'With down-cast look, and blush-embellish'd cheek</L>
<L>'At Love's request affented to be mine:</L>
<L>'Of fleeting bliss vain momentary shine:</L>
<L><PB N="44" REF="47"/>
'For she, in flow'r of Youth and Virtue's bloom,</L>
<L>'Was swept untimely to the rav'nous tomb:</L>
<L>'As sorrow-wounded o'er her couch I hung,</L>
<L>'To catch the tones that faded as they sprung,</L>
<L><HI>'The God,</HI> she said, <HI>now summons me away,</HI></L>
<L><HI>'Far from the confines of th' endearing day:</HI></L>
<L><HI>'Thou of the life I lose the dearest part,</HI></L>
<L><HI>'Thou chosen spouse! thou sun-beam of my heart,</HI></L>
<L><HI>'Say, by Affection's glowing hand impress'd,</HI></L>
<L><HI>'Shall I not live in thy recording breast?</HI></L>
<L><HI>'If sacred be the suff'rer's last desires,</HI></L>
<L><HI>'Revere what now my parting soul requires:</HI></L>
<L><HI>'I leave a brother, by bright Honour rear'd,</HI></L>
<L><HI>'By all approv'd, and much to me endear'd:</HI></L>
<L><HI>'Be, for the sister's love, the brother's friend;</HI></L>
<L><HI>'Nor from his side depart when storms descend:</HI></L>
<L><HI>'The palm of Glory waving in your sight,</HI></L>
<L><HI>'In council, peril, enterprise unite.'</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="45" REF="48"/>
<L>'Shall I, when danger calls, consign to air</L>
<L>'The last bequeathing wishes of the fair?</L>

<L>'By Love's subliming purest dictates taught</L>
<L>'Amid the perils that around thee wait,</L>
<L>'View me resolv'd to share th' impending fate:</L>
<L>'Now to this spot the foe impels the war,</L>
<L>'Discordance screams, opposing lances jar:</L>
<L>'The steep ascent lo CORTEZ now has gain'd,</L>
<L>'Ah, mark his spear with streaming gore distain'd.'</L>

<L>Th' illustrious youths now act their dread design,</L>
<L>See at the victor's knee they low incline!</L>
<L>Now clasp with circling force th' incautious foe,</L>

The heroes, blasted in their bold intent,</L>
