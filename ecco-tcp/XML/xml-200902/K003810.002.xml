<HEAD>LETTER LIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">TO MRS. ARNOLD.</HEAD>
<P>BY a line just received from Louisa I am interdicted at present from writing to her, and the sentiments which now oppress me are, indeed on <HI>all</HI> accounts improper to offer a mind pierced by so similar a sorrow. Yet, to restrain the whole dreadful weight in my own bosom would surely kill me. Do <HI>you</HI> then, O my dear cousin, my worthy Caroline, do <HI>you</HI> assist me.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="4"/>—Tell me, I conjure you, where the feeling heart shall find a sanc∣tuary? Tell me, what foliage is thick and impenetrable enough to repel that terror which assails an unhappy wo∣man, when the object of every hope and every fear is determined upon dangers the most complicated and de∣cisive? Henry, your <HI>favourite</HI> Henry, is gone, you know, to defend his coun∣try, to signalize his bravery, and to serve his King, I admit the propri∣ety of the enterprize, according to the laws of <HI>honour,</HI> but I weep at the ex∣tremity of its horror when tried by the laws of <HI>feeling</HI> and <HI>humanity.</HI></P>
<P>The glowing arguments of that dear departed, I did not dare to oppose.
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>
I faintly breathed the female resist∣ance. I feared, lest my affection might seem to be selfish, by contesting the point of separation. I violated the softness of my sex, and the tender∣ness of my nature, to restrain the flowing tide that rose in billows to my hearr, which laboured with the agony of suppression. His being this mo∣ment upon the sea, eager to gain the seats of hostility, is a proof of it! Perhaps, I might have seduced him from this adventure, since humanity and love (oh, how opposite from ra∣vage and war!) are the principles which figure fairest in the spotless history of Henry's youth. But I dreaded the after operations of inex∣orable honour, which might detest the
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>
trembling hand that saved it from the sword.</P>
<P>Yet <HI>now</HI> my Caroline, <HI>now</HI> that he is far removed from the voice of my complainings, and can no longer be disarmed by their sweet oppression, suffer, oh suffer me to mourn—suffer me to execrate that insatiate and wan∣ton <HI>power,</HI> which scatters desolation o'er the land! Ah this dire <HI>daemon</HI> of <HI>battle!</HI>—this <HI>daemon,</HI> who, with giant footsteps, tramples upon the best and most beautiful affections of the soul—who delights to hear the wail of the wounded, and the groans of the expi∣ring—whose vessels sail upon a sea of tears, and are wasted by sighs which are extorted from the tender bosom.
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>
I see, I see the sanguinary power. He shoots athwart the realms of affrighted fancy, in a robe of crimson, ten times dyed in the blood of his votaries. The soft verdure of the spring withers into the sterility of winter as he advances. The streams of plenty, which fertilized a happy world, stand checked in their progress, or roll onward a bed of troubled waters. Behold where the ruthless monarch approaches. The bounties and the beauties of nature fall before him. Territories are torn up by the roots, and empires mingle in the common ravage. Chained to his triumphal car—behold the lover, the orphan, the friend, the father, and the widow. Oh, Heavens! Fear, despair, and all the bleeding virtues,
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>
and all the family of pain, form his retinue. Dreadful, dreadful proces∣sion! And all for what?—for what, my Caroline? Wherefore is the peace of the world thus to be destroyed, where∣fore is man to raise his hand against the life of man, and deliberate mur∣der to be entitled to applause?</P>
<P>Hear, O humanity, the reply, and be <HI>still,</HI> if thou canst! The rulers of different realms, in the wanton exer∣tion of power, infringe upon what is falsely called the property of each other. Men, who are utter strangers to the very persons of one another, and are separated, perhaps, by parti∣tions of a thousand leagues, quarrel for a few vile acres of the dirt which
<PB N="11" REF="9"/>
shall presently cover the toiling race; and the lives of a people are devoted to the sword. Earth itself, wide as is extended her beautiful domain, is not <HI>enough</HI> extensive for these pigmy mor∣tals to divide amongst themselves; nor are the natural miseries of a very shorn life, with all its moral, all its civil, all its social evils, sufficient, without the aids of untimely and <HI>voluntary</HI> slaugh∣ter. The hurry of the scene, the din of the battle, and that political music which drowns the cry of distress, may <HI>pass over</HI> these sentiments, and huma∣nity will not have time to hear, nor to be heard. But in the quieter moment, when the <HI>gentle</HI> power revisits the bo∣som, and resumes the lovely throne from whence she has been driven, oh
<PB N="12" REF="10"/>
how impious, and how contemptible, will appear those bickerings, which terminate in the effusion of human blood! And could these heroes enter coolly into the <HI>consequence</HI> of this bar∣barous practice: this practice of defa∣cing and hacking away the express image of their God, to ascertain privi∣leges, in a world which was made for the reception and accommodation, the peace and the pleasure, of <HI>all</HI> mankind—could they be spectators of the ca∣lamity which equally attends the shout of victory and the shriek of defeat— could they behold the inconsolable wife sink upon her widowed bed, and the child, stretching forth its little hands in vain to greet a returning fa∣ther—a father, left naked, mangled,
<PB N="13" REF="11"/>
and unburied upon a foreign and an inhospitable shore—would not the touch of human pity assert its soft∣ening pressure, and all agree to culti∣vate the blessings of universal bro∣therhood?</P>
<P>How many wretches, forlorn and fallen, are at this instant pining away on the sorrow-steeped couch, while the heedless multitude echo the prai∣ses of one who has earned a laurel at the expence of adding acres to his King, and anguish to his country-women? I am no politician, Mrs. Arnold, I am a human being. I am a christian. I am one who prosess to adore a religion of peace—one too, who can never be persuaded that the
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>
cherub countenance of man—the ex∣press image of the deity, is created thus fair, and thus amiable, to be cruelly sported away in the riots of ambition, pride, and folly.</P>
<P>Ah my dear Henry! alive as thou art to all that is most endearing, what will be <HI>thy</HI> sensations <HI>after</HI> the bloody affray! Thou, whose bosom is gent∣ler than the mildest and kindliest bree∣zes of the spring!—what wilt <HI>thou</HI> feel, should some hapless woman, at∣tended by all her little orphans, de∣mand, of thy victorious hand, the slaughtered husband, and the slaugh∣tered sire? Or should but thy <HI>fancy</HI> suggest such a groupe, rushing through the ranks, and in piercing tones of
<PB N="15" REF="13"/>
agony exclaiming— <HI>"restore, restore</HI> them to me,"—how would'st thou support it? Thou, Hammond, whom the female sigh, the female tear, the female shriek, would at any time penetrate to the soul!—</P>
<P>On the other hand (and the chance alas, is equal) should it be <HI>thy</HI> fate to fall—oh thou dearest, best-beloved, and most <HI>worthy</HI> to be so—should the malignant star, that influences, full often, the hero's fortunes—should it ordain that—</P>
<P>O Caroline, Caroline, I congeal with horror. I can derive no lasting serenity from the pious example of the resigned Louisa. I rage, I rave. I
<PB N="16" REF="14"/>
cannot bear it. Indeed I cannot! Hope, duty, religion, are insufficient. I shall be detected in the deepest exi∣gence of my sorrow.—The tears are deluging my paper. My senses seem to turn—I am bowed to the earth—I am—Oh how shall I conceal what I am?—How disguise the horrors which press down the spirit of the most afflicted</P>

<HEAD>TO FREDERICK BERKLEY, ESQ.</HEAD>
<P>MY fair pupil makes a surprising progress in her new studies; and were not her heart too soft to sup∣port the pain occasioned by her hand, she would, in a little time, perform her amputation, and dress her wound with the best of us.</P>
<P>She seeks this barren novelty of knowledge by way of solace: yet it affords her little; for, through all her efforts to amuse and to disguise, I can see her distress. Ah Frederick, that it was permitted me to relieve that distress! Yet if <HI>Henry</HI>'s image still exists in her bosom—and, oh!
<PB N="18" REF="16"/>
how likely that it should!—it would be the very <HI>phrenzy</HI> of hope to expect success on my part. Would I had continued in India! Fortune has been extremely perverse. The gaiety of my character is passing away. Every pleasant habit is dropping from me, and the peace of my soul is about to take flight. Can a virtuous passion produce these revolutions? Yes, Frederick, nothing <HI>but</HI> a virtuous pas∣sion <HI>can</HI> produce them. It is a <HI>chaste affection,</HI> and will, depend upon it, be one way or another, rewarded. But it is very poignant; and yet, we best love the wounds of elegant tenderness when they cut most deeply into the heart. My affection for Emma in∣creases with the increasing difficulty

<P>WELL, my dear and dutiful daughter, ever kind, and ever considerate to me: I have not teazed you by premature importunity—I left you, quietly, to the effects, first of so∣ciety, and then of solitude. I want words to tell you how I am touched by those exertions you have made to acquire a conquest of reason over pas∣sion; and though I have sometimes detected the tear upon your cheek, and felt the breath of your sigh as it broke, by stealth, from your bosom; yet—In short my sweet girl, it seems now to be a proper crisis to communi∣cate the hopes, anxieties, and expec∣tations

Ere I quit this sublunary scene, I have <HI>two</HI> great ends to wish accomplished; and after that, wel∣come the moment which shall re-unite me to the cherub who was once your mother, and who gave to me my NOW only child—who gave the pledge of her fidelity to these paternal arms, in this very room:—for <HI>here</HI> was Emma born, and here is the proper place, to date an address which intreats her to make her birth a blessing to me.—<HI>When</HI> and <HI>where,</HI> then, shall an aged father whisper his wishes to a daugh∣ter?—O let the reciprocal duties be

The Times are greatly changed, and re∣quire great innovations of conduct. New modes of duty spring from new circumstances. Let us generously accommodate ourselves to incidents, which render improper to day, what might yesterday be right. I solicit an interview. Take your own time; yet think, that time is very <HI>precious,</HI> and treat me like a friend—treat me like a father. Enough. I write to my child.

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR COUSIN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is with great willingness I sit down to make a reply to the let∣ter you addressed to me; but it is not without much concern that I find it necessary to use the pen in answer to those which you addressed to Louisa, whose present state of health is such as to prevent her writing. Anxious, however, even as she presses the pil∣low of sickness, to alleviate the sus∣pense of her beloved Emma (in regard to the promised articles of confidence) she instructs me to acquaint you in the concisest way that I am able, of the
<PB N="29" REF="27"/>
means by which she became the wife of your unfortunate brother, as well as with the reasons which prevailed with her to keep that union a secret from <HI>his</HI> family, from her <HI>own,</HI> and from the <HI>world.</HI> She conceives too, that the deeper colours of distress in <HI>her</HI> fate, may by comparison, alleviate the softer tints of wretchedness in <HI>yours;</HI> for at the worst, my dear cou∣sin, as matters now stand, you have a lover living who is very properly the, object of many a charming hope; while the poor Louisa is daily tortured with reflecting on the death of one yet dearer than a lover—even a hus∣band and a father, who is the object of many a misery too mighty for the solace of sighs and tears.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="28"/>With respect to the letter I have had the pleasure to receive from you, it bespeaks a heart overflowing with streams of genuine philanthropy, and beautifully becomes the pen of Emma Corbett. But believe me, believe a woman who has been connected from her infancy with men devoted to the trade of arms—believe the daughter of a veteran chief, and the widow of one who felt the military passion in all its force—believe <HI>her</HI> when she tells you, that such gentle arguments are never of the least consequence in the eyes, or on the minds of a soldier. They serve only to make female weakness the more pitied by the men, who think the dignity of a more resol∣ved courage <HI>concerned</HI> to shew itself in
<PB N="31" REF="29"/>
<HI>contrast.</HI> Sometimes, it is true, the tears of a wife will excite the manly drop in the eye of a husband; but it tarries not. The voice of public fame is, on these occasions, louder than that of private affection. The world fixes an earnest look on the ac∣tions of an officer. One hero in∣flames another: the sparks of glory pass like an electric power: the neces∣sity of a brave <HI>example</HI> becomes appa∣rent: the profession soon grows into a darling passion. The blood warms: the genius of war takes possession of every faculty: home-connexions are forgotten: the scene of action ter∣minates the prospect: the warrior can see no farther. Valour and victory seem marching before him. There is
<PB N="32" REF="30"/>
not leisure for a private emotion, and tenderness would assist the efforts of his foe. He gives himself up, there∣fore, nobly, and absolutely, to the battle; wounds can make no impres∣sion upon him in the progress of his ardent career; and death itself is, in that moment, less terrible than defeat.</P>
<P>These, my lovely cousin, are not the sentiments of a theorist, but caught immediately from the lips of the very heroes who practised every action they relate. In the period of peace, few men of any order have a more elegant humanity than the English officers; and all the endearing qualifications, which make up the great domestic characters, are to be found amongst
<PB N="33" REF="31"/>
them; but in the day of contest, my cousin, a different duty calls upon them, and military fame is as easily wounded, and its wounds as vital to felicity, as those of a woman.</P>
<P>Let not your glowing pencil paint the protectors of our country as beings destitute of every tender feeling, but allow for their situation, which some∣times renders incompatible the im∣mediate union of love and glory: or the duties of peace with the duties of war.</P>
<P>While I close this sentence, Louisa expresses a wish to write to you <HI>her∣self.</HI> To-morrow she imagines that she shall be equal to the task, and she
<PB N="34" REF="32"/>
assures me that nothing which relates to the history of <HI>her</HI> husband and <HI>your</HI> brother, can come so properly from any pen as her own. In the hope of her gaining strength for the friendly effort, I will fold up my letter, and bid you farewell.</P>

<P>P.S. I find you are still indispo∣sed, and may, perhaps, want amuse∣ment in your solitude. To this end I send you the FRAGMENT of a little military history found amongst my fa∣ther's papers. It will shew you that humanity and bravery are nearly al∣lied, and that the tender husband and good soldier often form the same
<PB N="35" REF="33"/>
character, though they cannot always exert themselves in the same moment; or, perhaps, were we to scrutinize nicely, we should, in reality, find, that when the soldier is hazarding his life and liberty for that of his wife, his children, his countrymen, and his King, he is <HI>then</HI> the tenderest lover, the worthiest husband, the best pa∣rent, the most loyal subject, and the most valuable citizen. I believe it was written by my father in his youth, and I consider it as a family relique.</P>

<HEAD>A Military Fragment,</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><PB N="39" REF="37"/>THE CARBINES.</HEAD>
<P>OH for the history of that wound! said I; seeing a scar upon the cheek of the person ap∣pointed to shew me the hospital!—Oh for the history of that wound!</P>
<P>Not worth the telling, answered the man, pointing to the stump of his left thigh, as to a more important subject of curiosity. He took me into a dif∣ferent quarter of the building, which presented the lodgings of those who were pensioners. In each was a small-bed,
<PB N="40" REF="38"/>
bed, a chair, and a table. The atten∣dant's name was Julius Carbine. At a door leading into one of the apart∣ments he stopped; and then looked through an aperture, which com∣manded the room.</P>
<P>The luckiest of all moments, said Julius—for brother Nestor will soon be at it, and it is a day of discipline. We will enter.</P>
<P>Julius, said the owner of the apart∣ment, as we entered, sit down with your company. The side of the bed was covered with a clean white cloth by a little girl who opened the door, and I had also a little girl with me, and we all sat down. It was actually
<PB N="41" REF="39"/>
the <HI>brother,</HI> and not the brother <HI>soldier</HI> only, to whom Julius introduced us. In their appearance there was a frater∣nal similarity, not so much consisting in the features and limbs which re∣mained, as in the misfortunes which had happened to those invisible parts which lay scattered in different quar∣ters of the globe.</P>
<P>Julius was the younger of the Car∣bines, and as he placed himself <HI>side∣ways</HI> upon the bed, and desired Carbine the elder (whose name was Nestor) to suspend the attack—he told his story.</P>
<P>We slept in the same cradle, and were nursed up for the service. Our little arms—</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="40"/>He flourished a stump which pro∣jected about four inches from the right shoulder—Our little arms—</P>
<P>But I have begun the matter wrong and prematurely, for before I relate the account which Carbine gave of himself, I should offer some descrip∣tion, of his person, as well as that of his brother Nestor. It is the stump of Julius which reminds me of this.</P>
<P>Carbine the elder was the remnant of a noble figure, who in the upright∣ness of his youth must have risen six feet from the earth perpendicularly. He had the marks of about seventy years wearing in his face—allowing for the natural vigour of his form, the
<PB N="43" REF="41"/>
invasions of incident, time, and pro∣fession. The present stoop in his shoulders was favourable to the height, or rather to the want of height in his apartment. It is not without just cause that I called Nestor a <HI>rem∣nant.</HI> Nature originally mixed up in him her fairest proportions. At the time I saw him he was a capital figure reduced. For instance, if you looked him in the face, or, more properly to speak, in the residue of his face, you would perceive, in his left cheek, a deep scarification, which boasted no sort of rivalship with the glorious em∣browning of the other that had re∣ceived no injury. Though Nestor himself said, "the whole cheek, in comparison with the half cheek,
<PB N="44" REF="42"/>
looked like an errant poltroon." "It is a cheek," cried he, "which seems to have done no duty; now here," continued he, turning the other side to view with much triumph, "here are the signs of service."</P>
<P>Both the Carbines, indeed, had <HI>served</HI> to some purpose. In point of honorary credentials there was little cause of jealousy. Nothing could be more equally divided than the mu∣tual marks of brotherhood in bravery. Sorely battered were the outworks of both. It is worth while to observe how the matter was settled to their satisfaction and credit. The thigh of Julius became the victim of a para∣pet, but then Nestor was even with
<PB N="45" REF="43"/>
him when he had the honour to drop his left arm in the counterscarp. But as if fortune did not imagine an arm, and that a <HI>left</HI> arm, a sufficient equi∣valent to a whole thigh, amputated at one decisive whizz by a cannon ball, she deprived Nestor of his right foot, which was left at the bottom of an entrenchment in Flanders. The younger Carbine had the track of a musquet visible at the extremity of his neck, and the bullets with which that musquet was charged slanted along the left jaw, carrying off some of the finest teeth in the world, and which, perhaps, are even yet to be seen in one of the fossés. To bring the military scale even, on the part of Julius, he has the good fortune to
<PB N="46" REF="44"/>
conceal under his hat (which upon account of that concealment he seldom wears) a respectable confusion, which; beginning at the left ear, swept away not only the greatest part of that, but all that grew in its path, from one end to the other; which distinguishing stroke is in honour of the bastion. But Julius had his <HI>unostentatious</HI> wounds too: his shirt covering no less than six, insomuch that his bosom was crossed this way and that, direct and transverse, like a draught-board. I detected the flush of something like victory in the countenance of Julius, as he threw open his chitterlin, and opened his shirt-collar under pretence of too much heat: but Carbine the elder checked his brother's ambition
<PB N="47" REF="45"/>
by baring his right arm to his shoul∣der, (or rather begging <HI>me</HI> to bare it) and there discovering a masked battery of blows, which were a fair match for those in the breast of Julius.</P>
<P>Thus were the testimonies of their prowess participated; and if (said they) either of us could have boasted a less equal division, it would have been a blow too many for our friend∣ship, and, perhaps, have bred ill blood betwixt us.</P>

the veteran Carbines, after having platooned and pioneered it for a number of years, in the cause of their country, found at length, they could keep the field no longer.</P>
<P>They entered the Temple of Peace: but not quite on the footing of ordi∣nary members. The senior Carbine privately enjoyed some small privi∣leges, and the junior was in possession of the casualties, derivable from shew∣ing the hospital to such as had the curiosity to survey it: and he hopped about with his <HI>ruins</HI> in a manner that engaged one's pity and admiration.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<P>A second rent in the fragment.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="47"/>Now Nestor was a man of inali∣enable affections. They were not to be subdued. The military passion was by no means dead in his bosom. The heart of the soldier was still visi∣ble in his little bed-chamber. There were to be seen, suspended from the walls, the battered corslet that had co∣vered his breast, and the firelock, whose iron mouth was almost worn out by the loadings. They were brightly burnished, and the nicest care taken to clean them weekly.</P>
<P>But this was nothing. The practi∣cal part of a soldier's discipline did
<PB N="50" REF="48"/>
Nestor carry on in a room of forty inches diameter.</P>
<P>No sooner were we all seated by the side of the bed, than a singular cere∣mony began. He had six sons, all little, all living for their country, and in secret training for the battle under their father. It was his custom, thrice in the week, to turn the key upon all the pensioners but his brother, and instruct his family in the art of war. Poor as he was, he had actually been at the cost of equipping them; had fitted up for them something that re∣sembled a uniform, and, in miniature accoutrements, presented them with the sword, the musquet, and the bayonet.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="49"/>The soldier's science was taught them by the veteran. One branch or another of the art military was the subject of every day. The sons of Nestor Carbine knew not the enerva∣ting luxuries of artificial heat: they thawed the severity of the seasons with nobler fires. Their education was wholly martial. At night they listened to the lecture, and their swords were drawn forth to practice what they had heard in the morn. They engaged their strengthening arms in the <HI>mock</HI> fight, that they might be prepared for the <HI>real</HI> one. It was now the evening of the ravelin, then of the flanking; now of the fortification, then of the fossé now of the half-moon, then of the epaulement; now of the saps, and
<PB N="52" REF="50"/>
then of the ambuscade; now of the horn-works, and then of the bastion; now of the gabion, and then again of the mines, the parapet, the battery, or the tenaille.</P>
<P>They had just began an engage ment as we entered the room.</P>
<P>It will be best related before the younger Carbine tells his story. Let him therefore repose a little longer upon the bed.</P>
<P>The stripling troops were drawn up three deep in the center of the room, and the object of attack was a large deal trunk set upright betwixt the contending parties. One side were to
<PB N="53" REF="51"/>
oppose and one to defend. The fa∣ther was commander, and in good time came the brother, who instead of reposing on the bed as above-menti∣oned, sprung up with surprizing agi∣lity, and hopped away to head the adverse party, making a kind of war∣like music with a little drum tattoo'd by the timber instrument that served him for an arm. Nestor, meantime, assumed a whistle which served for a clarionet.</P>
<P>The engagement was carried on in the exactest military order; they ad∣vanced, they retreated, they rallied, and they came on again. Every little heart panted with ambition, every eye sparkled with expectation of victory.
<PB N="54" REF="52"/>
The mimic ardour soon became real, and the two generals were themselves wrought up into a serious sensation. Julius shouted, and Nestor encou∣raged. But, presently, the aspect of the battle altered, for one of the <HI>besie∣gers,</HI> (a boy of uncommon bravery) took one of the <HI>besieged</HI> prisoner. The conqueror flourished his little foil, but the captive shed tears of slavery and sorrow. The general on the worsted side affected to be dismayed. His opponent, spirited up his army, pursued his victory, took a <HI>second</HI> of the enemy prisoner, and the town (that is, the <HI>box</HI>) was taken.</P>
<P>A shout of joy was heard on one side, while the poor remains of the
<PB N="55" REF="53"/>
conquered troops fled to a corner that was the interior encampment behind the bed. Julius beat the dead march with his wooden drumstick: but Nestor and his troops, having burst the city gates, (that is, the box <HI>lid</HI>) proceeded to plunder. It contained all the magazines of the enemy, con∣sisting of new foils, martial caps, belts, wooden bayonets, confections and fruits. These were the prizes of conquest. They were all fairly won, and divided amongst the victors ac∣cording to seniority. The little girl, who had sat on the bed, now sprung up, took a small ozier basket from a hook, and strewed flowers in the path of the victorious, singing a song of triumph as they marched round the
<PB N="56" REF="54"/>
room. The ceremonies, however, being over, both parties came for∣ward, and shook hands very heartily in token of good will, and then the affair ended with <Q>God save great George our King</Q> and a general huzza.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<P>—Our little arms, continued Julius, (whom I will interrupt no more) were nursed into early vigour for the field: for our father, whose bones—</P>
<P>May every Saint bless them, said Nestor!</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="55"/>—have been reposing more than half a century, in different parts of Flanders and Germany, struck first into that mode of training which my brother has adopted. Other people's children have playthings given them, because, forsooth, they whimper for them; but we were never allowed so much as a hoop or a top till we gained it by a victory. We knew the diffi∣culty of obtaining the prize, and va∣lued it the more; and thus were fitted for deeds of hardihood, ere other in∣fants had an idea of glory.</P>
<P>Poor creatures! said Nestor's se∣cond son scornfully.</P>
<P><HI>We</HI> could vault upon the steeds of the menage before <HI>they</HI> could keep
<PB N="58" REF="56"/>
the saddle of their wooden ponies. Ripe for practice, we were sent forth, at an early age, to the field, and both of us entered as volunteers in the ser∣vice of our country.</P>
<P>We did so, said Nestor.</P>
<P>Nature—for which stump as I am, I still thank her—gave us no bad forms; and though we took the field with faces <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s effeminate as that of our mo∣ther,—[You was reckoned the very model of her, you know, Nestor]—yet the first campaign left us no room to blush upon that score. Our virgin engagement happened in the hottest glow of the summer, and we were soon rid of a delicacy which is inglo∣rious
<PB N="59" REF="57"/>
on the front of a soldier. Oh with what pleasure did we contemplate the alterations at our return!</P>
<P>I remember it, said Nestor, smiling.</P>
<P>The traits of the mother were quite worn out by the weather. In every lineament there was seasoning. The sun had written hero in our counte∣nances, and we rejoiced in the dignity of the tan.</P>
<P>But mark the joke, sir; a fantastical pair of wenches pretended to love us, in our fair-weather suit of features, before we made the first sally, that is, before we were <HI>worth</HI> loving; but took it into their heads to quarrel with our
<PB N="60" REF="58"/>
appearance the very moment we re∣turned. They wanted still to see the red and white of the <HI>woman,</HI> and so took to themselves new paramours.—The jades gave us up, sir, for a couple of fellows who would shudder at the patter of a hail-storm.</P>
<P>So much the better, said Nestor. We have had the satisfaction to see one of the rascals hanged for sheep-stealing, and the other you know is to be put into the pill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ory this day se'en-night.</P>
<P>And I'll be prepared for him, I warrant ye, exclaimed one of the boys.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="59"/>No, child, said Nestor: he is no mark for the son of a soldier.</P>
<P>After this, sir, we had no lazy pe∣riods of peace. Some part or another of Europe was continually beating the drum or sounding the trumpet in the ear of England. It was our duty to go forth in her defence.</P>
<P>Father, said the eldest of the boys, when is it likely we shall have a <HI>war?</HI></P>
<P>My brother, sir,—(continued Car∣bine, who was not put out by any, fa∣mily remarks)—my brother, sir, had, the honour of the first misfortune.</P>
<P>You do not call it by a right name, said Nestor.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="60"/><HI>He</HI> triumphed in the first testimony of the warrior.</P>
<P>I am an elder brother, said Nestor, and the first blow was my birth-right.</P>
<P>But I was soon even with him: for, towards the close of the campaign, a random shot—when I was thinking of nothing less, gave the four fingers of my left hand to the enemy. In that condition we entered into winter quarters.</P>
<P>But no sooner was my brother cured of the wound in his face—</P>
<P>You may see the mark of it here, sir, said Nestor.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="61"/>—in his face, than he received one much deeper in his heart!</P>
<P>In his <HI>heart,</HI> cried the youngest of the six sons, clapping his hand on his father's side?—why, you joke: here it is alive and merry now. I can feel it beat.</P>
<P>God keep it so, answered the eldest. It will be a sore day for us when that stops, I promise thee.</P>
<P>Give me thy hand, Ferdinand, said Nestor; and, brother, do you go on with your story, for it entertains the gentleman and his little daughter, and I like to hear it. You were always good at a story from a child. Go on.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="62"/>—would you believe it sir, that a fellow so sliced should have the im∣pudence to attack one of the prettiest girls in England?</P>
<P>In the <HI>world,</HI> you might have said, cried Nestor, shaking his knee.</P>
<P>—like a brave boy of the blade, he pushed his point right on, turned his <HI>worst</HI> side to the wench, and in∣sisted upon her taking the scars as a recommendation.</P>
<P>Why they <HI>were</HI> so, said Nestor, holding his knee still while he spoke.</P>
<P>—in this manner he continued to batter the citadel which trembled
<PB N="65" REF="63"/>
in the bosom of the poor girl, and in less than a month (no time at all for such a siege) he entered the fair castle of her affections in triumph.</P>
<P>By the blood that I have shed, sir, said Nestor, and by the drops which <HI>yet</HI> flow in my body, Frances was the best and bravest wench that ever lay by the side of a soldier.</P>
<P>Nestor, said Julius, hold your tongue.—His limbs, sir, were almost constantly on the move. War carried them away. What of that? His joke was ready. Never mind, Frances, (would he say to his wife) I am the winner yet. Fear nothing. Were I reduced to my trunk, I should flourish
<PB N="66" REF="64"/>
still, my girl. A soldier, whose chil∣dren have blood in their veins, is invul∣nerable. He is immortal in his sons.</P>
<P>Let us <HI>engage,</HI> father! said one of the boys eagerly, as he brandished his soil.</P>
<P>Thus would my brother heal up the wounds of the war: but be that as it may, wounds are but sorry things in a family. Often has my brother disputed with me on this sub∣ject. "Julius, (would he say) thou art but half a loyal subject still—<HI>thou</HI> givest to thy country the services only of an individual, while <HI>I</HI> furnish it with the force of a whole family. As an <HI>individual,</HI> thou must soon die; but
<PB N="67" REF="65"/>
hadst thou taken care to <HI>multiply</HI> thy∣self as I have done, thou mightest well expect to live and conquer these thou∣sand years. Brother, brother, it is a false notion; a soldier ought of all men in his Majesty's dominions the soonest to marry: he ought indeed." Notwithstanding this, sir, I could ne∣ver be prevailed upon. No, though an honest girl offered to sling my knapsack across her shoulder after the loss of my thigh. To confess the plain truth to you, I did not like cer∣ta
in ceremonies betwixt my brother and sister, at their partings. Frances indeed wept but little, but in my opi∣nion, she <HI>looked</HI> a much deeper sorrow than is to be expressed by a pair of wet eyes.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="66"/>Nestor hemm'd violently.</P>
<P>And as to my brother, though he cocked his hat fiercely—pretended to have caught cold—rubbed up his ac∣coutrements, and blustered mightily, he never was steadily himself—and how the devil <HI>should</HI> he be— for a week after. These things, sir, are against the grain. The brush of a bullet is nothing at all: it may take off your head, or it may only take off your hat: either way, no great matter—but the cries of a woman—the piercing ago∣nies of a wife to come across one's thoughts in the last moments—no, sir,— no, damn it—there is no bearing that— I will live and die a batchelor!</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="67"/>But this is not the worst, sir. <HI>Death</HI> sometimes comes at the bottom of the account to <HI>unsoldier</HI> a man. He knocked at brother Nestor's door, and carried Frances away while she was nursing him of a fever into which he was thrown by the pain of a wound. Zounds! that was a terrible day, Nestor, was it not?</P>
<P>Terrible! said Nestor, turning his head from the company.</P>
<P>She died suddenly. Courage, said I, brother. He waved his hand and spoke not. Brother, said I, have cou∣rage. "Fool, replied he, in a pas∣sion—(if he had called me so in cold blood, I would have had him out)—
<PB N="70" REF="68"/>
Fool, said he, (in a way that one could not but forgive him, stamping his foot on the ground at the same time) am I, thinkest thou, before GOD ALMIGHTY or the enemy? What has courage to do before HIM? thou should'st tell me to be <HI>patient.</HI> I said no more: for the poor Frances lay dead before his eyes; and there being but one bed of any size, the living and the dead lay together.</P>
<P>Child, (said Nestor to the little girl, his daughter, who was sobbing at the side of the bed, with her apron thrown over her eyes)—come hither. Thou art <HI>like</HI> thy mother—kiss me.</P>
<P>Nestor (continued Julius) tied the crape round his arm, and his soul was
<PB N="71" REF="69"/>
in mourning. He gave Frances to the earth. Decency—</P>
<P><HI>Go no farther,</HI> said Nestor.</P>
<P>—Decency required <HI>my</HI> atten∣dance, sir. My poor Carbine shed then the first tears that I ever saw upon his cheek. Oh! he was melted down into something softer than his mother. He wanted to prevent the man from striking the nails into the coffin.—</P>
<P>Julius, GO NO FARTHER, I say, (cried Nestor) pressing his daughter close to his breast.</P>
<P>I wish my uncle would hold his tongue, said one of the boys.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="70"/>He opened the closed lid, and peeped in, (continued Julius.) He cast a lingering look into the grave. He drew his hand gently over the cof∣fin as the sexton was beginning to lower it. He kneeled down to see that it was put <HI>softly</HI> into the ground. He let it go, and said he was perfectly resigned; then came away, and then returned, then went off a second time, and sought the grave again, wringing his hand, and declaring he was per∣fectly resigned all the time—</P>
<P>Wilt <HI>kill</HI> me, Julius? said Nestor; stop, I say!</P>
<P>—in short sir, he—he—he—did so many things upon that occasion,
<PB N="73" REF="71"/>
that; surely, if a man has any love for a woman, he ought to be a bat∣chelor.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<P>[The fragment is here defaced, and illegible for some pages.]</P>
<P>after the engagement, the solemn thoughts again came on. Julius rubbed his face twice or thrice along the pillow, and declared that while the wind continued in that quarter, his old achs would twinge him a little.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="72"/>And in this hospital, sir, we are now laid up for life, said Julius.</P>
<P>He rubbed his face again upon the pillow. Well, said he rising, every dog has his day!</P>
<P>Upon this Nestor began to whistle:—not one of those tunes, which arise from vacancy, but a whistle truly con∣templative; it was more slow and pen∣sive as he proceeded, and in its closing cadence, a tear started from his eye. Streaming almost to the borders of the upper lip, it settled there, and though as he waved his head back∣wards and forwards, it trembled upon the edge of his cheek, it did not fall.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="73"/>When he had opened the door, I stole an Opportunity to put something into his hand.</P>
<P>He took it as money ought to be taken by a brave or worthy man who wants assistance, and sees no shame in receiving it. A sober smile came into his countenance: but the TEAR con∣tinued.</P>
<P>His daughter's hand was still closed in his; but she looked at the tear, and was taking out her handkerchief.</P>
<P>Let it alone, my dear, said Nestor. IT IS YOUR MOTHER'S.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="74"/>How are the Carbines to be envied, said I, when we were stepping into the street!</P>
<P>You flatter us, replied Nestor, bowing gently.</P>
<P>I went two paces, and turned back.</P>
<P>The tear had verged off, possibly while he was bowing.</P>
<P>It had got upon <HI>my</HI> little girl's face; and there it hung like a dew-drop from a rose-bud.</P>
<P>Good God, said I, how rapid an exchange!</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="75"/>In saying this I found it had va∣nished from the cheek of my daugh∣ter, in the time that I was making the exclamation!</P>
<P>Alas, it is <HI>quite</HI> gone then! said I.</P>
<P>No! upon lifting my hand to my face sometime after, I found the pre∣cious offering of sympathy had chan∣ged a <HI>third</HI> time its residence, and was trembling on my <HI>own</HI> cheek. I blessed it, and</P>

<P>I KNOW not whether I shall live long enough to relate the horrors of my situation!</P>
<P>On the evening of the day that I desired the suspension, I felt an im∣pulse, more strong and more sacred than that of common curiosity, to know the full scope of my suspicions.</P>
<P><HI>Before</HI> this interview, my distress ap∣peared sufficiently great. Alas! we are continually exclaiming that the heart will break, without knowing what ad∣ditional burthens it will bear, even when we think it is <HI>most</HI> surcharged.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="80"/>Come hither, dear Emma, said my father—drawing me gently to him—his hand trembling as he touched my gown.</P>
<P>—Come hither, I want to thank you for the long series of soft compli∣ances, which your dutiful heart hath poured into this aged bosom. <HI>But</HI> for thee, my child, your unfortunate fa∣ther would have no pillow to support him.</P>
<P><HI>Unfortunate,</HI> sir, did you say?</P>
<P>O <HI>most</HI> unfortunate, my Emma! I am in distress—<HI>worldly</HI> distress. And it is so extreme, that I have been compelled (ah, hard necessity!) to dis∣pose
<PB N="84" REF="81"/>
of this fair mansion, which hath more than a century owned a Corbett for its Lord. This very room, my dear, which gave—oh spare me, Emma—this very room, the conse∣crated spot of <HI>thy nativity,</HI> is now another's; and so are the late heredi∣tary lands that smile around it. The ruin has been <HI>deliberate</HI> too; and I have concealed it from every eye, even (and indeed chiefly) from <HI>thine,</HI> till now, that I am in the <HI>arms of po∣verty.</HI> There is, at this moment, an execution entering my house in Lon∣don; which contains the last reliques of a fortune, that, some years since, amounted to an hundred thousand pounds.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="82"/>—That accursed war!—that dire <HI>American</HI> contention!—that civil fury which hath separated the same inte∣rests of the same people!—</P>
<P>Here it begins, my child!—but where will it close? Oh slavery—oh imprisonment! how terrible are thy horrid walls and galling fetters to <HI>one</HI> whose bosom burns with the divine flame of liberty!—how insupportable to an old man!—to a father, whose daughter's <HI>consequence</HI> in life must flow from <HI>his.</HI></P>
<P>O thou lovely stream from a foun∣tain whose sources are stopped—what, <HI>what</HI> is to be done?</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="83"/>The <HI>decisive</HI> blow came yesterday upon me. I had, ere this, in reserve, one rich casket—but it is gone: the last capture has deprived us of it. It would have been enough for <HI>my</HI> age and for <HI>your</HI> youth, but the post of yesterday—</P>
<P>It is unnecessary to detail the cala∣mity. It is crushing: it is irremedi∣able: it is ruinous. I am in beggary.</P>
<P>Oh, Emma! bred up to elevated expectations, what is to become of thee? Your brother is slain. Your father old and enervated, a prey to pain of body from the most piercing of human disorders, and to anguish of mind, from reflections the most cut∣ting.
<PB N="87" REF="84"/>
Your property both at home and abroad (for mine was naturally your's) lost or despoiled!</P>
<P>Oh, Emma! what is to become of thee? Would you renovate my youth—would you rebuild your for∣tunes?—</P>
<P>I could not speak, Louisa.</P>
<P>If you <HI>would,</HI> continued my father, receive with a smile those accents which inform you, there is a gentle∣man—rich, generous, virtuous, wor∣thy, and of whom you have a good opinion—a gentleman who would esteem the <HI>hand of Emma</HI>—</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="85"/>—Ah, what have I said—oh shameful sacrifice!—pardon, pardon me, my child. You shall <HI>not</HI> be <HI>sold,</HI> my love. No, no: let us be above the sordid commerce. Let us enter the gloomy gates together. Let us be poor—let us be necessitous—let us combat the common wants of nature—but let us not be <HI>contemptible.</HI></P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">TO EMMA CORBETT.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prior to the receipt of the above,</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>NO, my loved sister, I will not, cannot, send a long story. A few pages will comprise the main circumstances; and let those suffice till days of future conversation. Your father had ever an ambition to enlarge the fortune of his Edward by marriage: and Edward had already sufficient to his wishes. He ac∣quainted his father of the love which he bore to Louisa. It produced a dispute. My brother happened to be present. He entered, as your father exclaimed, "What but beggary can be expected with a girl like Louisa
<PB N="90" REF="87"/>
Hammond, of scarce an hundred pounds a year!"—The conversa∣tion stopped.</P>
<P>Sir, (said Henry to Edward, when they were alone) had any man living but Emma's father spoke in those terms of my sister, he should have been punished for it severely.—I love <HI>Emma Corbett,</HI> and to her he is in∣debted for—</P>
<P>And I love <HI>Louisa Hammond,</HI> sir, (replied your brother) but my father has an arm of his own, and that fail∣ing, he has that of a <HI>son,</HI> to defend him from the insults of a boy, should he <HI>dare</HI> to—</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="88"/>It is an improper place to discuss the question, said Henry. They went out. Henry commanded Ed∣ward, in terms of intolerable seve∣rity, never to offer his hand to Louisa, while Edward insisted, that Henry should desist from farther engaging the affections of Emma. The inhi∣bition was promised to be observed, and a breach of it was to terminate in the last frightful decision amongst men. Edward ceased his visits, and I knew not the cause. Henry did the same, and you was equally ignorant of the motive. I fell sick; a fever seized my spirits, and my life was de∣spaired of. Edward heard of my ill∣ness, and came to visit me at a time that he knew Henry was from home.
<PB N="92" REF="89"/>
He found me in the extremity—the fever was become putrid, and the phy∣sician ordered no one to approach my breath any nearer than could be avoided; the bed was strewed with the herbs which are supposed to pre∣vent infection. Regardless of this, and every other image of self-preser∣vation, Edward rushed into my cham∣ber, threw himself upon his knees by the side of the bed, and hung his head over my face, which received and welcomed the tender tears that were streaming from his eyes. O! Louisa, Louisa, (said he) I can bear it no longer! At these words Henry was heard upon the stairs, Edward leaped up—Heavens! said he, can it be pos∣sible, is Henry returned! Well, it is
<PB N="93" REF="90"/>
no matter. My brother entered the room, and at the sight of Edward stept back, like a man astonished. Edward ran up to him, threw his arms about his neck, and insisted that the em∣brace should be returned. Oh Henry, he exclaimed, too long have we mu∣tually suffered a false delicacy to pre∣vail. Enough have we sacrificed to pique, for Emma and Louisa have been the victims. I heard that your sister was dying, and I could not deny myself the mournful privilege of a friend—will you chide me for it Henry?—will you still withhold your hand and your heart from the brother of Emma Corbett? <HI>Will you?</HI> This was the first moment I had been in∣formed of the dispute. The surprise
<PB N="94" REF="91"/>
was too much for me in the <HI>firmest</HI> state of my constitution. In the con∣dition I <HI>then</HI> was, it had well-nigh proved fatal. All which my strength suffered me to do was to raise myself on my pillow, fold my hands in the attitude of intreaty, and with feeble accents to implore, they would spare my last moments, and not embitter them by <HI>their</HI> enmity.</P>
<P>Ere I had uttered this, Henry and Edward were weeping on the necks of each other, and Henry said, alas! Ed∣ward, I <HI>owe</HI> you more than this, for on my part was the promise first bro∣ken. I have secretly maintained the usual correspondence with Emma, since she has been away: and found
<PB N="95" REF="92"/>
the <HI>tenderness</HI> superior to the <HI>anger</HI> of my temper. Indeed we have <HI>both</HI> been wrong. Henceforward, let us be <HI>more</HI> than friends—if possible, let us be brothers. Shall we not my Edward?</P>
<P>Again Emma I clasped my hands, and a sudden sense of joy came over me that gave a turn—a <HI>happy</HI> turn to my disorder. I recovered. It was agreed between us that the <HI>cause of the quar∣rel,</HI> and the means of t
he reconcilia∣tion, should be equally a secret. The families were re-united, and none but Edward, Henry, and Louisa, could account for the late coolness on the part of the two former. But the har∣mony was not of long duration;—
<PB N="96" REF="93"/>
it was again interrupted by your fa∣ther's violence in the cause of <HI>America,</HI> opposed to that of my brother in the cause of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> Edward sided with the former, and, though it no longer prevented an intercourse be∣tween us, it threatened an eternal se∣paration of political interests. At the same time Henry was permitted to address you, and Edward conti∣nued openly his partiality for me. Nay, your father at last declared, he hoped still to see two countries resto∣red to the embraces of each other, and two happy matches to felicitate their union. You were, my dear Emma, fortunately from home on a visit during most of these transactions, and your Henry did not think it pru∣dent
<PB N="97" REF="94"/>
to break the thread of an elegant affection by the little jarrings that were happening to cross it at home. The contest now became fierce on the other side the Atlantic, and threatened to carry bloadshed and rapine to that part of the continent where Edward had property. Louisa, (said he to me, one evening) I must cross the seas: my fortune is in danger: it con∣cerns equally you and me, that I should endeavour to desend it, yet I will wait another month to hear the event of terms that are proposing be∣tween the countries—if they produce <HI>peace,</HI> you know how ready I shall be to continue in England; if they <HI>fail</HI> of that end, you must have resolution enough to part from me for a short
<PB N="98" REF="95"/>
season. But, continued he, as no man can tell the chances of the slightest separation, I ardently wish to call you by the tenderest of all human titles, <HI>mine,</HI> before I go. <HI>Publickly</HI> this can∣not be done, for though my father affects to consent, our union would make himun happy. No, Louisa: let our happiness be known only to our∣selves till it is proper to communicate ir. Impart it nor, till my return at least, to Emma, to Henry, or to any part of the family. I have my rea∣sons for it, even more strong than those that have been already related.</P>
<P>Soon after this conversation, Emma, we were privately married, and none of the appointments that led to the
<PB N="99" REF="96"/>
ceremony, or which succeeded it, were discovered or suspected. Pre∣vious to the voyage of my hapless husband, he put into my hand a sealed paper, containing his will, and he de∣sired I would not open it till his re∣turn. In the fond hope of that return being possible, I have, till within these few days, kept the seal unbroken, and now, alas! I find it is a testamentary disposal of his property abroad, be∣queathed entirely to me as sole exe∣cutrix.—</P>
<P>Yes, my dear Emma, there <HI>is</HI> a fa∣therless Edward, and Heaven only knows whether the father had any knowledge of its birth before he died. I repeatedly sent letters, full of all a
<PB N="100" REF="97"/>
mother's minute and affecting solici∣tude, but I received no replies. To Mrs. Arnold, dear and generous friend as she is, I owe the power of keeping my husband's secret, not∣withstanding an event that promised to betray it. The poor little one was lately taken ill, and his death every moment expected. It was that (oh Nature!) made me write the disordered scrawl, which intrea∣ted Emma to forbear her visit. On my reaching the house of our wor∣thy Caroline, I found the cold hand of death lay heavy on my child. I wept sore. I offered up the prayer of the desolate widow, not <HI>wholly</HI> to be∣reave me; and begged (ah how ear∣nestly)
<PB N="101" REF="98"/>
the Blessed God to restore <HI>one</HI> or receive <HI>both!</HI></P>
<P>My prayer was heard. My child grew well. Your letter came in the warmest, newest, and most melting moment of matron extacy. The smile of the babe was in my eye, and in my heart. I saw miniatur'd forth, the features of the murdered Edward. Oh the beautiful extreme of rapture! It grew too big for bearing. I de∣voured my child with kisses. I ran with weeping joy to Mrs. Arnold. I thought of thee, oh lovely Emma, as of Edward's sister, and I gave thee, in that charmingly unguarded period, the dear deposit of my bosom, which none but Caroline shares with thee.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="99"/>Edward, the <HI>infant</HI> Edward, sleeps as I write this. His gentle breathing is as the music of the spheres to his mother's ear. Ah, had there been a pause—a stop—an <HI>eternal</HI> stop in that harmony, what should I have done? But he lives, and I will not murmur. Oh for health to rear his tender youth. Emma, you are his aunt, and oh, should this feeble frame fail to hold out so long as he may want a protec∣tor, and when alas, will that cease to be!—will you not—ah will you not be unto him a mother?

<P>THE irresolute note which I sent this morning to your chamber, is not worth your attempting to decy∣pher. I wanted to express my sym∣pathy of your present misfortune in a way more answerable to the emotions of my friendship. I wished to gather such knowledge of some persons <HI>con∣nected with your loss,</HI> as might enable me to plan some pious fraud to relieve your stuation without wounding your delicacy. But I should make bung∣ling work of it, and destroy the feli∣city I intended to promote. I am a man of plain feelings, and have no dexterity of address when it is neces∣sary
<PB N="110" REF="107"/>
to adorn them. Accept then, dear Corbett, of an honest mind, in lieu of elegant manners. Is any decoration necessary to introduce a friendly circumstance?—and if there is not, wherefore do I thus lengthen the preface?</P>
<P>Corbett, I am one of those whom the world calls an unthrifty fellow: for I value money merely as it con∣duces to my happiness. My happi∣ness depends on society, and not on myself alone. I have fixed it in the dear domestic circle that encloses Emma and her father. Beyond that barrier I do nor desire to wander; and if I can promote their felicity, my own will, of necessity, be compleat.
<PB N="111" REF="108"/>
You see my system. It is simple and concise. By uncommon chance I am become rich, you know. The sum I possess is too much to be dissipated, and not enough if I had a passion to accumulate. It is quite sufficient to render three persons happy, so far as happiness takes its colour from mo∣ney. Amongst three persons then let it be divided; but let only two of those know the source by which the third is supplied. You may easily persuade Emma to believe (what in∣deed will be true) that by an unex∣pected turn, your losses are repaired. She will be too much rejoiced at the event to teaze herself about the means. Or, if she <HI>should</HI> enquire, her curiosity is of a tender kind, and will readily
<PB N="112" REF="109"/>
be pacified. I hope you love me too well to make scruples; and yet I shall prepare myself to combat them. It is really a very hard and mortifying thing, that these <HI>bare-weight</HI> duties betwixt friend and friend, should be so rare as to make the offer of them a matter of embarrassment; as if there was nothing expected in society but its etiquette and professions. All I desire is, that you will lose no time in settling your affairs, and no otherwise remember the <HI>mode</HI> by which they are accommodated, than as it may im∣press your bosom with tender sensa∣tions, and strengthen the cement of that alliance which is formed between us. With Emma, I will (on the above conditions) take my chance as before,
<PB N="113" REF="110"/>
but for the wealth of worlds I would not have her acquainted with a tittle of our private transactions. Nor must you attempt to sway her. Leave her to the same chances as would <HI>before</HI> have happened. It is very unrea∣sonable that I should expect her to marry <HI>me</HI> for <HI>affection:</HI> but, for Hea∣ven's sake, save me the distress of ac∣cepting the sacrificed hand of grati∣tude I am glad it is in my power to offer my testimonies of friendship to you before she has been <HI>influenced.</HI> I will be with you presently, and you shall have no prejudices of custom about you, till you detect any thing of (what is foolishly called) the wisdom of the world, clinging to the hand or the heart of</P>

<P>I FANCY there was some <HI>mistake</HI> in the letter that I enclosed from Corbett: for I find his affairs are all re-adjusted, and the generous refusal of my overtures to Emma (at a time when most parents would think them most acceptable) has no longer force. The prohibition is taken off, and I am again at liberty to make myself tenderly unhappy.</P>
<P>Corbett is now as much recovered in health, as in his circumstances, and word is just brought that Emma is better. O my heart! how shall I support the sight of her!—If her sick∣ness
<PB N="118" REF="115"/>
has made any great alteration—if she appears to be in pain, or in any kind of danger, I shall assuredly discover myself. Methinks I have more fondly wish'd myself her husband since her con∣finement and indisposition, than while she was rejoicing in health and plea∣sure. I do not desire to unite myself to her beauty, more than to her weak∣ness and distress. Surely, Frederick, the tender offices of a friend are <HI>most</HI> amiable, where they are <HI>least</HI> observed by the world. The feeblenesses to which the tender frame of woman is subject, are, perhaps, more seducing than her bloom.

<P>It is past. It is decided. I have read my fate, without disclosing my condition. I entered the library, and found Emma—ah, how shall I describe to you the situation in which I found her! She had been observing the ra∣vages of war, as they are figured in the prints which are hung around the room. I saw the tears still standing in her eyes. O those eyes!</P>
<P>And what has been the matter, Emma, said I?</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="129"/>I have been weeping over the re∣presentation of a <HI>compleat victory,</HI> re∣plied Emma. She then traced the bloody progress of the pictured battle, and in all the pathos of philanthropy addressed me thus.</P>
<P>"O Sir Robert, behold the images of conquest and defeat!

of its parent,</HI> and wage unnatural war with his brother about the division of the spoil? Avarice and ambition are of the same family, and assist the vices of each other: the one delights in the plunder, the other in the havock by which it is obtained.</P>
<P>"—But yonder the ruin is more rapid and glorious—behold in yon∣der corner they are employed in re∣moving the dying and the dead. In that lacerated body there yet seems life.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">TO LOUISA CORBETT.</HEAD>
<P>WE are returned to town. The several inclosures will ac∣quaint you with the affecting transac∣tions which have past since the last stop in our correspondence—a stop, my dear Louisa, made in very <HI>sympa∣thy;</HI> for though you have of late re∣peatedly told me that you found a pathetic kind of pleasure in sharing griefs so congenial to your own, I could not but blush at the pain which I must often have created you. Yet nature, at this very time—poor feeble nature, strongly prompts me to repeat the fault. My heart swells high with sorrow, and I stand in need of the par∣ticipating
<PB N="141" REF="138"/>
Louisa. Nor will any <HI>but</HI> Louisa soothe me. Mrs. Arnold is generous and sensible, elegant and in∣formed, but oh! she has not drank so largely of that bitter, yet salutary cup which subdues the effervescence of the spirit, and disposes us to melt at the miseries of another. She is a widow without knowing the value of her hus∣band, and love seems a secondary passion in her mind to that of glory.</P>
<P>How is it my friend, that we do not hear from Henry? Ah what an affecting difference betwixt a post∣office and a ship!</P>
<P>O <HI>distance,</HI> DISTANCE, it is now I begin to feel what thou art! Join, I
<PB N="142" REF="139"/>
conjure you, Louisa, the prayer of Emma—supplicate the Power at whose command the winds and the waves are still,— supplicate him in behalf of a hapless woman whose treasure is tossing on a precarious sea. Beseech that the hospitable barks may salute each other, and that their separation may alleviate mine. Implore that these things be granted, and my heart shall be at rest.</P>
<P>—At rest! and will my alarms be hushed by such a circumstance? Are the beating of the <HI>billows</HI> all I have to fear? Alas, the perils of the water are merely introductory to those of the land. Scarce will the dangers of the stood be past, ere those of the
<PB N="143" REF="140"/>
field come on. Which way then shall my petition be directed? The policy of nations, and the dictates of nature, the voice of ambition, and that of peace, are so distinct, that a perpetual war seems to be proclaimed between <HI>divine</HI> and <HI>human</HI> institutions. The tender and graceful interest which na∣ture bids us take in the fate of those whose lives and fortunes are dear to us, make us wish well to the natives of our country, and the friends of our heart: and it is on this principle, but not for the parade of dominion, or the barbarian flush of victory, that I wish well to the cause of Henry and his associates—I do not say COUNTRYMEN, for it appears that <HI>we</HI> are at war with these, as <HI>they</HI> with us: a large, and
<PB N="144" REF="141"/>
once <HI>loving</HI> family divided against it∣self. Whom are <HI>we,</HI> Louisa, to con∣sider then as enemy, and whom as friend? WE suffer, alas! bitterly, from the contest on either side. Oh God of tranquility heal up the <HI>mutual</HI> wound, and suffer not that which is terrible between <HI>different</HI> people, even in <HI>hostile</HI> nations, to become more in∣tolerably so by allowing it to rage amongst <HI>brethren!</HI></P>
<P>The paths of military honour, Louisa, are cut through the bowels of humanity; and heroism laughs at the apostrophe of pity: but I, who want refinement to extinguish the simpli∣city of my sensations, shall yet persist
<PB N="145" REF="142"/>
to call even <HI>victory</HI> a calamity. I am extremely ill, but have relieved my∣self by writing.</P>

<P>I MOVE up and down, obedient to the impulse of my passion.</P>
<P>I am now in London, attending the sick chamber of Emma, into which I gain access only by virtue of my pro∣fession. Her affection preys fast upon her health. Yet it becomes her age, and its object is amiable. It is an affection which nature, virtue, and re∣ligion, conjoin to make respectable. Youth gives it a new charm. Mis∣fortune throws over it a tender and in∣teresting shade. Sickness adorns it with peculiar softness, and absence
<PB N="147" REF="144"/>
assists sensibility, in rendering the whole more touching.</P>
<P>Such is the love of Emma: while <HI>mine</HI> is the passion of a man who ho∣vers round the idol of his heart with the most doating fondness, at the time that he is convinced of the folly and impropriety.</P>
<P>In vain, Frederick, you ridicule, invite, and advise. I cannot quit Emma. She is sick, and I am wretched. She loves another, and it does not relax the diligent attentions I pay to her virtue and her beauty. She has fallen in the path of my life, and I make a dead stop. I cannot

<HEAD>LETTER LXXXVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">TO C. CORBETT, ESQ.</HEAD>
<P>I WILL not affect to misconceive you, my only parent. You seem constantly anxious to connect me with some worthy man, as the associate of my life; yet do not recollect that my choice is made, my principles fixed, and my heart <HI>inalienably</HI> engaged. An unsubdued veneration for truth attends me. I caught the inspiring affection I bear her, from the respect∣able authors of my being. It is a pre∣judice as early as it is amiable, and you should not wonder if I walk stea∣dily in the way of my directors. This, sir, I have often told you. I have been brought up to consider the happiness
<PB N="155" REF="152"/>
of life, not as deducible from the maxims of the world, but from impli∣cit reliance upon that power whom Heaven has seated upon the throne of the soul, as an unerring judge in all cases of moral arbitration. It has been a hard task for me to struggle with the various inflictions which have long hung over our house, and though the burst of nature has sometimes bro∣ken unawares, it was not in <HI>those</HI> sea∣sons that I was the most unhappy. When only the pitying eye of GOD was upon me, when I sought the silent corner, and could secretly commune with my own heart, and enter into all its inclinings: then—<HI>then,</HI> my father, it was that the extreme of your Emma's wretchedness came over her;
<PB N="156" REF="153"/>
for she found it impossible to wean her affections from an object, one so en∣tirely and with so good reason appro∣ved, and now so entirely, and (you will pardon me) without any solid rea∣sons, rejected. I have not, at this period, my dearest father, collection of mind enough for much argument; but you will please to recollect that it was you who first kindled the sparks of tenderness for Henry. Besides that we were brought up together, when gentle impressions are easily admitted and unreservedly avowed, you re∣presented him as an orphan of honour, talents, and good-sense. I depend on every thing you say, and was charmed with a sentiment correspondent to my own. The affection was full grown,
<PB N="157" REF="154"/>
and had expanded into blossom, ere you attempted to destroy, or even to check it. Then, <HI>all at once,</HI> you said you had your reasons, (which to this hour remain partly unexplained) to desire I would think no more of Henry Hammond: yet, you averred, it was not fortune nor any other cir∣cumstance relating to what the world calls <HI>a good match,</HI> that created a change in your esteem. Want of <HI>worth</HI> I am sure it <HI>could</HI> not be; and yet you still persist to dissuade me from attaching myself to merit, elegance, and virtue.</P>
<P>I am glad this method of addressing each other by letter, though in the same house, has, by accident, been adopted. It appeared awkward at
<PB N="158" REF="155"/>
first, but hath now the familiarity of a habit. It may well be said, in <HI>my</HI> case, "to excuse the blush and pour out all the heart." Yet wherefore do I talk of blushing! Surely, it is not necessary. I yield not to any roman∣tic pomps of passion. I make it not a subject, where it can be likely to create one discordant feeling. I love with simplicity and truth: and it is far be∣yond my power—far, even as the pre∣servation of a solemn vow is from the breach of it, to change my object but with a change of its purity. The oaths that are taken at the altar, sir, may <HI>ratify</HI> tenderness, but cannot <HI>create</HI> it: and amongst the sordid connections of men, it is not uncommon to be in∣vested with the public sanction with∣out
<PB N="159" REF="156"/>
ever receiving a private assent from the understanding or the heart. I do not think the law of the land, of itself, sufficient to make a woman happy. Marriage is a very honour∣able, but it may be a very miserable institution: that is, it may produce misery while it confers honour. The <HI>ceremony</HI> is only the <HI>seal</HI> of mutual love, but the <HI>bond</HI> should be made before; and in point of attachment I hold my∣self at this moment as religiously uni∣ted to Henry as if all the forms of the earth had passed my lips in confir∣mation. The same idea will be lodged in my bosom whether that confirma∣tion be remote or near. It is not in∣tended by Heaven to be the affection of a year only. It is to last for life.
<PB N="160" REF="157"/>
It is to follow its object through all perils and dangers. Its holy ardour is to burn equally bright and pure, and nothing but death is to extinguish it. Thus contracted, my father, in spirit and in truth, you will easily judge how light must be the sacrifice of my cousin's strange legacy. The <HI>political</HI> tenets of Mr. Hammond have nothing to do with my friendship for him. As they have carried him into a dangerous path of life, far from <HI>me,</HI> I so far deplore them. I chose not the <HI>officer</HI> but the <HI>man!</HI> and though it is, alas, but too unlikely that our <HI>personal</HI> interests should be made <HI>one,</HI> yet the union of our souls is too sincere, and too strong, for five and twenty times the conditional five thousand pounds
<PB N="161" REF="158"/>
to loosen or dissolve. I felt myself about to declare that not <HI>any</HI> earthly motive could induce me to embrace this gorgeous bribe: but I am sud∣denly checked, and find, upon scru∣tiny into this filial bosom, O my dear <HI>dear</HI> father, that <HI>one</HI> motive, and <HI>only one</HI> there <HI>might</HI> have been, which could make your Emma <HI>the victim of money.</HI></P>
<P>Had the late convulsions of fortune remained in their full force—had it pleased God to <HI>increase</HI> their violence —had all that could have been raised by the aids of property and industry proved insufficient—and had those ve∣nerable hairs been <HI>indeed</HI> consigned to sorrow, and none but a <HI>daughter</HI>'s du∣teous

hand to help a parent's poverty in that dire case, my beloved father, if you have a true sense of my nature, you will guess what I should have been tempted to do I should have ac∣cepted the conditions in the codicil, and secured to my father a resource from indigence at a time of his life when humanity is the least able to bear it. I would <HI>not</HI> then have "mar∣red an officer engaged in the natio∣nal contest." Yet even <HI>then,</HI> my affection would remain, though its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>timate views would be changed.</P>
<P>In the private recesses of my soul, the image of Henry would still be en∣graved; and although I sacrificed all
<PB N="163" REF="160"/>
that was possible or necessary, to duty, it would be long, very long, ere I could withdrawthat chaste and chann∣ing sentiment which gives me in all transitions, a title to esteem—ah more than esteem—to <HI>love</HI>—<HI>him tenderly.</HI></P>

<P>THE <HI>Gazette! flain! wounded!</HI>— Oh I had no conception to what an extreme of misery I was re∣served! You have mistaken me; but of what dire information has that mis∣take been productive? There <HI>has</HI> then been an engagement! You have seen the bloody list. It must have been <HI>purposely</HI> concealed from me. The skirmish, you say, was sudden. You read of a Captain <HI>Ham∣merson.</HI> In the hurry of war it is easy to drop one syllabie, or to add another. These conflicts are too great.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="182"/>The inclosed will shew you that the wounds of Henry need not have been subjoined to the violence of a parent blinded by the rage of hydra <HI>party!</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>wounds</HI> of Henry, did I say—O hold—hold my heart; I cannot bear it—indeed I cannot.</P>
<P>Adieu. I will think upon a re∣medy.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">TO EMMA CORBETT.</HEAD>
<P>EMMA, be yourself. You <HI>must</HI> make one generous effort. I see you languishing under my eye and canot bear it. Thrice have I seen you in the sick chamber within a few weeks. It is easy to perceive that your whole soul is pining after Henry—the <HI>perfidious</HI> Henry; with whom your union <HI>must never be</HI> while you think proper to own a <HI>father,</HI> and ac∣cept his <HI>protection.</HI> I tell thee, Emma, that were he this moment <HI>returned,</HI> and returned with what degenerate Bri∣tons <HI>now</HI> call <HI>glory</HI>—nay, could he lay the conquest of the plundered colo∣nies at <HI>thy feet,</HI> there exists a reason
<PB N="187" REF="184"/>
which would make it vile—yes, mark the strength of the term—VILE, in <HI>Emma Corbett</HI> to accept it. But I see nothing less than the entire explana∣tion of the fact will convince thee. To crush, therefore, every lingering hope at once, know thou dear infatu∣ated, thy father still leans his very soul on the welfare of America. Those fortunes which have been destroyed, those debts which have impove∣rished me, as well as those ample streams of commerce which rolled un∣obstructed from shore to shore, were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l dedicated to injured America. For <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> thy brother's blood was shed, and had I yet more sons, more fortunes, and more resources, they should all be at the service of that violated country.
<PB N="188" REF="185"/>
She is injured—she is aggrieved, my daughter. Her oppressions are at my heart.—The strings that fix it to my bosom are trembling for her.—She glows with a generous love of free∣dom.—She has been condemned with∣out a hearing.—She was stabbed into resistance.—The sword was held to her throat ere she thought of self-defence. Conflagration, famine, and parricide, have entered her late peaceful habita∣tions.—The common bounties of Pro∣vidence have been denied her.—The blood of citizens, of brothers, and of friends, are flowing in rivers through her streets.</P>
<P>I have not, Emma, been one of those who hawk about my principles,
<PB N="189" REF="186"/>
and saunter in babbling ignorance from coffee-house to coffee-house. I am <HI>fixed</HI> in <HI>my</HI> politicks, and think my steady adherence to them a part of my <HI>religion.</HI> Since we are cruelly taught to make a sanguinary mark of distinction betwixt an Englishman and and an American, I own myself the latter, and deplore the infirmities that prevent me from rushing to the field. My child, my child, I know the rui∣nous rapacity, the murder, the VII∣LAINY of this unnatural war. I enter deeply, and pathetically, into every wrong which America sustains. It is the only point wherein I am enthusi∣astic, and it is the only point where enthusiam is great and glorious! Do not imagine, rash girl!—monstrous
<PB N="190" REF="187"/>
thought!—do not DARE to imagine ungrateful Henry shall ever receive the hand of Emma. Spare me, belo∣ved daughter, in this one part—this sore, this tender part—and in every <HI>other,</HI> command your father! You owe me this submission, you owe me this FAVOUR, this <HI>indulgence.</HI> I would have preserved your Hammond, and opposed his entering into this wicked employment, but it was impossible. High of heart, he scorned to be even <HI>tenderly</HI> controuled. I endeavoured to win him generously over to an ho∣nourable cause. He called it insult, bribery, baseness. The military dis∣traction was throbbing in every vein. When I argued, he justified every measure of ministry. <HI>Great-Britain,</HI>
<PB N="191" REF="188"/>
he said, was grossly abused—her le∣nity scorned—her laws defied—her sublime prerogative contemptuously set at nought. He spoke loud and vehement of American <HI>rebellion.</HI> The honour of the empire, he said, now depended on the exertion of each in∣dividual, and it was the duty of every young man (whom every tie of inte∣rest, every bond of loyalty, and every principle of policy called upon) to ma∣nifest his zeal, his courage, and his at∣tachment. He went on, my child in all the foaming folly of youth, de∣claring, that he should account himself base, were he to deny the <HI>contribution</HI> of his arm. The greater his love for <HI>Emma,</HI> the nobler his <HI>sacrifice,</HI> he said. He was determined: he had made up
<PB N="192" REF="189"/>
his mind: and was resolved to defend his country or gloriously perish in her ruins. I pitied his delirium, yet ve∣nerated his ardour. Well directed, of what was it not susceptible! He was above admonition, and kept er∣ring on. In true tenderness to thee, my Emma, I forgot the dignity of age, and even stooped to intercede. After all my letters to him were in vain, I privately sought a personal interview, but his boiling spirit took fire, I re∣luctantly withdrew, and gave up the point.</P>
<P>Oh America, thou bleeding inno∣cent, how art thou laden with oppres∣sions! Oh my child, my child! Na∣ture, Religion, and Religion's <HI>God,</HI>
<PB N="193" REF="190"/>
are on her side; and will you take to your arms, and to your embraces, a youth who propensely <HI>violates</HI> these? —a cruel youth whose reeking blade may at this moment smoke with kin∣dred gore! Tyranny hath not a re∣serve of barbarity in store. She is exhausted. Your Henry is a <HI>volun∣teer</HI> amongst those who, as an acquisi∣tion to the British army, have added the tomahawk, the hatchet, and the scalping knife. And will the tender-hearted Emma continue to love such a barbarian? Away, away, it will not bear a thought! Banish, obliviate, <HI>detest</HI> him. He is in open rebellion against the <HI>laws of nature.</HI> Let your affections flow into a fairer channel—
<PB N="194" REF="191"/>
ah suffer a parent's hand to pilot them. He has a <HI>friend</HI> in reserve, my dear— <HI>such</HI> a friend—</P>
<P>But tell me that you have <HI>resumed yourself.</HI> Tell me that you are <HI>indeed</HI> my daughter.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XCVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD>TO FREDERICK BERKLEY, ESQ.</HEAD>
<P>I WILL withdraw my foolish self from this <HI>ill-starred attempt.</HI> Go down to Castleberry, and I will meet you there without delay.</P>
<P>The perplexity of interests in this family, where each part opposes the other, and where still greater entan∣glement is promised, are really too many for <HI>me</HI> who have made a sudden transition from quietness to agitation.</P>
<P>You cannot reprobate my weakness in a keener style of censure than I myself do. Oh, I know full well the
<PB N="196" REF="193"/>
unfitness of such storms to the sober season of my life. I conceal the cause from all but you, and your reproof shews me, how little mercy I might expect were that cause imparted to less generous hearts.</P>
<P>The matter grows too interesting. A certain darling passion, which scarce confines Corbett on this side phrenzy, and the avowed pre-engagements of Emma, which are more than barriers of iron against me, unite to point at the necessity of retreat. <HI>Expect</HI> me, therefore; and when we are together, prepare yourself with subject of con∣versation; which, indeed, may take any turn but that of my <HI>infirmity:</HI> all men, who are <HI>conscious</HI> they possess any,
<PB N="197" REF="194"/>
proscribe this. In happiness and in misery, Frederick, we have a few grains of self-love; and, while all its proud associates croud about us, we suffer no theme to be discussed that can humiliate us to ourselves.</P>

<P>STOP, stop, dear friend. Visit not Castleberry yet. I have twice attempted to take leave, and twice failed—twice packed, and twice un∣packed my portmanteau—twice or∣dered my servant to get horses, and twice pretended to be weatherwise, and, as an excuse for <HI>changing my mind,</HI> have prophesied a <HI>change of atmosphere.</HI> In the noon-tide brightness of the sun I have predicted storms and hurri∣canes! and it is in vain the fellow casts his eye to the heavens, and declares that the weather is fixed. It is his master, alas! and not the air, which is unsettled.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="196"/>A little delay can make no diffe∣rence. Indulge me. Humour me.</P>
<P>Within a post or two I will decide, and decide too as you and as <HI>common sense</HI> demands of me.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XCIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">TO C. CORBETT, ESQ.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE a suspicion that Mr. Ham∣mond is wounded; let that cir∣cumstance, oh my father, account to you for the horrors of mind which have for some days locked up every power of hand and of voice. The former faculty is in some measure restored, so far at least, as tremblingly to trace upon paper something like an answer to your affecting favour; every sylla∣ble of which is as an envenomed ar∣row fixing in my bosom. Your de∣termined objection then to poor Henry is at last accounted for! I thought the sanguine track of party was washed wholly from a father's heart by the
<PB N="202" REF="199"/>
blood of my brother. Shall political prejudices interrupt the finest affecti∣ons of humanity? Horrid is the as∣pect of battle, view it on either side. It cannot shift to an attitude, nor take <HI>one position,</HI> to soften its terrors upon the reflecting <HI>mind.</HI> To THAT it is uniformly odious; nor is it at all amen∣ded by considering, that as it began soon after the <HI>creation,</HI> it will scarcely end till the <HI>destruction</HI> of the world. It has, even within the narrow pre∣cincts of <HI>our</HI> family, divided the son from the father, and the lover from his mistress; let it not be rendered <HI>more</HI> dire by setting the interest of the daughter against that of her most ho∣noured parent, since <HI>that</HI> would be to encourage the madness of mortals,
<PB N="203" REF="200"/>
and the civil pestilence, that in the form of a <HI>family-war,</HI> is gone forth against us. It would violate the gen∣tle laws of nature, and tear down those conciliating ties which fasten <HI>kindred</HI> in one vast chain of connexion, ample as earth, and beautiful as heaven. You have painted your own patriotism and that of Henry, sir, with equal vi∣gour of language; at least, you have said enough either way to prove that <HI>both</HI> fancy the <HI>cause adopted</HI> is the cause of rectitude and glory. When one side attacks, the other must naturally defend; on which account, while the spirit of contention remains, some will vehemently censure the very measures which some as vehemently applaud. But, in avowing your own enthusi∣asm,
<PB N="204" REF="201"/>
my dear father, do you not, in effect, justify that of Henry? You both seem to hug to your bosoms a political Cleopatra, for whose sake you are willing to gain or to lose a world. England is to Henry what America is to you. Each insists that he is espou∣sing the cause of an injured friend: and while this is the case, how can it be expected that <HI>either</HI> should yield? In fact, would not such a concession, according to the prescriptions of <HI>ho∣nour,</HI> in this world's acceptation of the word, be accounted base? You have, you say, attempted to direct the sword of Henry on the better side of the dis∣pute. <HI>Which</HI> is that better side? Henry declares for Britain; you for America. What third person shall
<PB N="205" REF="202"/>
decide between you? The feeble voice of a woman will neither be heard or admitted. Else, might she ven∣ture to assert that your countrymen are bleeding abroad, while the point of right and wrong is adjusting at home. This, however, is clear, my dear father, from your own premises: if Henry thought himself insulted by the proposal of changing his side, <HI>you</HI> would have been no less stung, had a similar proposition come from <HI>him</HI> to <HI>you.</HI> And this proves, that both are acting on what is called patriotic prin∣ciple. What right reason then has the one to be displeased with the other? Yet upon this displeasure on your part, you urge me to withdraw my vows. Are then virtuous resolu∣tions
<PB N="206" REF="203"/>
so to be withdrawn, my father? When affection is fashioned by the feelings, and long cherished in a soul which neither projects nor practises any ill, whose every thought is sub∣mitted to the holy criticism of Hea∣ven, nor ever dreads the scrutiny—is it, under these circumstances, of a texture so convenient, as to shift from object to object with every gale of opinion, and move away at the word of command? Wherefore, let me once again tenderly enquire, where∣fore did you originally inspire me with a veneration for sober reason? why infuse in me a steady and gene∣rous way of thinking? Was it de∣signed for ornament or for use? If not intended as the <HI>governing rule of con∣duct,</HI>
<PB N="207" REF="204"/>
through every meander of this mortal pilgrimage, oh wherefore did you not at <HI>first,</HI> even in the nursery, while every power was impressive and would have taken the form you chose to give it—wherefore <HI>then</HI> did you not lead me into the path that I was to tread without stop or turning? Alas! you have given me fixed princi∣ples, acknowledged they were good, saw them with joy take root in my heart, and now you expect in their fullest growth and finest foliage, that they should suddenly perish. But the habits of my youth are grown so strong, that I feel it is too late for me to deal in disguises. I will not now begin an artificial character. Oh! suf∣fer me to implore you, sir, to continue
<PB N="208" REF="205"/>
my attachment to Truth and Nature. I know nothing of state wrangles, or Congress quarrels. I mix not with the infuriate errors of party. I only act up to those simple principles of moral life, which assure me that con∣stancy in favour of <HI>a known valuable object</HI> (not obstinate predilection to a <HI>bad one</HI>) is the basis on which the su∣perstructure of all that is noble, just, and good, must be raised. My wis∣dom is extremely limited. It stretches not into those maxims which desolate the earth for a vapour of victory, nor does it presume to penetrate the wiles of government. All it <HI>does</HI> pretend to, belongs to that small and dear sys∣tem in which every woman ought to be instructed; namely, that a <HI>well∣fixed
<PB N="209" REF="206"/>
tenderness</HI> should never be remo∣ved, that it should brave the storms of fortune and distress, that while life remains it should be the animating <HI>purpose</HI> of life to <HI>cultivate</HI> it, and that death, and death <HI>only,</HI> should dissolve the bonds which virtue had made. If my beloved father would for one moment lay the clamorous contenti∣ons of a bickering species aside, and submit to be charmed by that dispas∣sionate power which decides calmly of truth and falshood, he would be con∣vinced of this. I am sure he would: for his nature is gentle and his heart is soft. Ah think what a task it is for your soul-sick Emma to be under the necessity of using these pleadings at <HI>such a time!</HI> Come to her bed side—
<PB N="210" REF="207"/>
perhaps the cause of <HI>our</HI> disputes may now—</P>
<P>Oh for pity my father, hasten to me—aid me in this dreadful conflict—rescue me from myself—wipe away the bitterest tear that anguish ever drew from the heart of a daughter, and recover me, ere it be yet too late, from the arms of death.</P>
