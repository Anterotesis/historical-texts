<HEAD>The Servant Man, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WILLIAM was a lively young servant, who lived in a <HI>great but very irregular family.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>is place was, on the whole, agreeable to him, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ited to his gay thoughtless temper. He found a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>entiful table and a good cellar. There was in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed, a good deal of work to be done, though it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as performed with much disorder and confusion. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e family in the main were not unkind to him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ough they often contradicted and crossed him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pecially when things went ill with themselves. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>is, William never much liked, for he was al∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ys fond of having his own way. There was a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erry, or rather a noisy and riotous servants' hall; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> disorder and quarrels are indeed the usual <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ects of plenty and unrestrained indulgence. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>en were smart but idle, the maids were showy, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>entious, and all did pretty much as they liked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a time, but the time was commonly short. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ages were reckoned high, but they were seldom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>id, and it was even said by sober people, that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aster was insolvent, and never fulfilled any of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>attering engagements, or his most positive pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ises; but still, notwithstanding his real poverty,
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>things went on with just the same thoughtlesnes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and splendor, and neither masters or servants look¦ed beyond the jollity of the present hour.</P>
<P>In this unruly family there was little church go¦ing, and still less praying at home. They pretende<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> indeed, in a general way, to believe in the Bible, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it was only an outward profession, few of them rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it at all, and even of those who did read it still fewe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were governed by it. There was indeed a Bibl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lying on the table in the great hall, which wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> kept for the purpose of administering an oath, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> was seldom used on any other occasion, and som<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the heads of the family were of opinion that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> was its only real use, as it might serve to keep th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lower parts of it in order.</P>
<P>William, who was fond of novelty and pleasur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was apt to be negligent of the duties of the hous<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> He used to stay out on his errands, and one of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; favorite amusements was going to the parade to s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the soldiers exercise. He saw with envy ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> smartly they were dressed, listened with rapture <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the music, and fancied that a soldier had nothi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to do but to walk to and fro in a certain regul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> order, to go through a little easy exercise, in sho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to live without fighting, fatigue, or danger.</P>
<P>"O," said he, whenever he was affronted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> home, "what a fine thing it must be to be a s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦dier! to be so well dressed, to have nothing to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but to move to the pleasant sound of sife and dru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and to have so many people come to look at o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and admire one. <HI>O it must be a fine thing to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> soldier!"</HI></P>
<P>Yet when the vexation of the moment was ov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> he found so much ease and diversion in his mast<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> house, so suited to his low taste and sensual ap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦tites,
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>that he thought no more of the matter. He forgot the glories of a soldier, and eagerly returned to all the mean gratifications of the kitchen. His evil habits were but little attended to by those with whom he lived; his faults, among which were lying and swearing, were not often corrected by the family, who had little objection to those sins, which only of∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ended God and did not much affect their own interest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r property. And except that William was obliged to work rather more than he liked he found little, while <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e was young and healthy, that was very disagreea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le in this service. So he went on, still thinking how∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver, when things went à little cross, "what a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ne thing it was to be a soldier!" and at last one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay as he was waiting at dinner, he had the misfor∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>une to let fall a china dish, and broke it all to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ieces. It was a curious dish, much valued by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amily as they pretended; this family were indeed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pt to set a false fantastic value on things, and not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> estimate them by their real worth. The heads <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the family, who had generally been rather pa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ent and good-humoured with William as I said <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>efore, for these vices, which though offensive to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od did not touch their own pocket, now flew out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>to a violent passion with him, called him a thou∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd hard names, and even threatened to horse∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hip him for his shameful negligence.</P>
<P>William, in a great fright, for he was a sad cow∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d at bottom, ran directly out of the house to avoid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e threatened punishment, and happening just at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at very time to pass by the parade where the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oldiers chanced to be then exercising, his resolu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on was taken in a moment. He instantly deter∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ined to be no more a slave, as he called it; he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould return no more to be subject to the humours
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>of a tyrannical family; no, he was resolved to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> free, or at least, if he must serve he would serve n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> master but the King.</P>
<P>William, who had now and then happened to hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from the accidental talk of the soldiers, that tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> who served the <HI>great family</HI> he had lived with, we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> slaves to their tyranny and vices, had also hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in the same casual manner, that the service of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>King</HI> was <HI>perfect freedom</HI> Now he had taken it in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> his head to hope that this might be a freedom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> do evil, or at least to do nothing, so he thought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was the only place in the world to suit him.</P>
<P>A fine likely young fellow as William was, ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no great difficulty to get enlisted. The few for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> were soon settled, he received the bounty-mone<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as eagerly as it was offered, took the oaths of all<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦giance, and was joined to the regiment, and hearti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> welcomed by his new comrades. He was the ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦piest fellow alive. All was smooth and calm. T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> day happened to be very fine, and therefore Willia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> always reckoned upon a fine day. The scene w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> gay and lively, the music cheerful, he found t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> exercise very easy, and he thought there was litt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> more expected from him.</P>
<P>He soon began to flourish away in his talk; an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> when he met with any one of his old fellow servan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> he fell a prating about marches and counter-marche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and blockades, and battles, and sieges, and bloo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and death, and triumphs, and victories, all at ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦dom, for these were words and phrases he h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> picked up without at all understanding what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> said. He had no knowledge, and therefore he h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> no modesty, he had no experience, and therefo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> he had no fears.</P>
<P>All seemed to go on swimmingly, for he had
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>yet no trial. He began to think with triumph what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mean life he had escaped from in the old quarrel∣some family, and what a happy, honourable life he should have in the army. <HI>O there was no life like <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he life of a soldier.</HI></P>
<P>In a short time, however, war broke out, his regiment was one of the first which was called out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o actual and hard service. As William was the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ost raw of all the recruits he was the first to mur∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur at the difficulties and hardships, the cold and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unger, the fatigue and danger of being a soldier.) what watchings, and perils, and trials, and hard∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hips, and difficulties he now thought attended a military life! "Surely," said he, "I could never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave suspected all this misery when I used to see <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he men on the parade in our town.</P>
<P>He now found, when it was too late, that all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eld-days he used to attend, all the evolutions and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xercises which he had observed the soldiers to go <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hrough in the calm times of peace and safety, were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nly meant to fit, train, and qualify them, for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctual service which they were now sent out to per∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orm by the command of the <HI>King.</HI></P>
<P>The truth is, William often complained when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ere was no real hardship to complain of; for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e common troubles of life fell out pretty much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ike to the <HI>great family</HI> which William had left, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the soldiers in the <HI>King's army.</HI> But the spirit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f obedience, discipline, and self-denial of the latter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>emed hardships to one of William's loose turn of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ind. When he began to murmur some good old <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ldier clapped him on the back, saying, "cheer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p lad, it is a kingdom you are to strive for, if we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>int not, henceforth there is laid up for us a great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eward, we have the <HI>King's</HI> word for it man." Wil∣liam
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>observed that to those who truly believed thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their labours were as nothing, but he himself did not at the bottom believe it; and it was observe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of all the soldiers who failed, the true cause wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that they did not really believe the <HI>King's</HI> promis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ He was surprised to see the then soldiers, who use<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to bluster, and boast, and deride the assaults of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> enemy now began to fall away; while such as ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> faithfully obeyed the <HI>king's</HI> orders, and believe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in his word, were sustained in the hour of tria<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ Those who had trusted in their own strength all fain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ed in the slightest attack, while those who had p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> on the <HI>armour of the king's</HI> providing, <HI>the sword</HI> and <HI>the shield,</HI> and <HI>the helmet,</HI> and <HI>the breast-plat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and whose <HI>feet were shod</HI> according to order, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> endured hardships as good soldiers, and were e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦abled to fight the good fight.</P>
<P>An engagement was expected immediately. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> men were ordered to prepare for battle. Whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the rest of the corps were so preparing, William whole thoughts were bent on contriving how h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> might desert. But alas! he was watched on a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> sides, he could not possibly devise any means <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> escape. The danger increased every moment, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> battle came on. William, who had been so sure an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> confident before he entered, flinched in the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ment of trial, while his more quiet and less boas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ful comrades prepared boldly to do their dut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ William looked about on all sides, and saw th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> there was no eye upon him, for he did not kno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that the <HI>King's</HI> eye was every where at once. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at last thought he spied a chance of escaping, n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> from the enemy, but from his own army. Whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> he was endeavouring to escape, a ball from the o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦posite camp took off his leg. As he fell, the fir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="9" REF="8"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ords which broke from him were, "while I was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> my duty I was prese<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed, in the very act of de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rting I am wounded." He lay expecting every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oment to be trampled to death, but as soon as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onfusion was a little over, he was taken off the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eld by some of his own party, laid in a place of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fety, and left to himself, after his wound was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ressed.</P>
<P>The skirmish, for it proved nothing more, was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on over.

<P>As he was sitting in this weak and disabled con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ion, uttering the above complaints, he observed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enerable old officer, with thin grey locks on his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ad, and on his face deep wrinkles engraved by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e, and many an honest scar inflicted by war. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illiam had heard this old officer highly com∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nded for his extraordinary courage and conduct <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> battle, and in peace he used to see him cool <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d collected, devoutly employed in reading and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ying in the interval of more active duties. He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ld not help comparing this officer with himself.
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>"I," said he, "flinched and drew back, and wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> even have deserted in the moment of peril, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> now in return, I have no consolation in the ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> of repose and safety. I would not fight then, I ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not pray now. O why would I ever think of bei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> a soldier? He then began afresh to weep and l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ment, and he groaned so loud that he drew th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> notice of the officer who came up to him, kind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> sat down by him, took him by the hand, and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦quired with as much affection as if he had been h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> brother, what was the matter with him, and wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> particular distress, more than the common fortu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of war it was which drew from him such bitt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> groans?"

<P>William at once saw the difference betwe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the soldiers in the <HI>King's</HI> army, and the peop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in the <HI>great family;</HI> the latter commonly withdr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> their kindness in sickness and trouble when m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> wanted, which was just the very time when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> others came forward to assist. He told the offi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> his little history, the manner of his living in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>great family,</HI> the trifling cause of his quarrelli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> with it, the slight ground of his entering i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>King's</HI> service. "Sir," said he, "I quarr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦led with the family, and I thought I was at o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> fit for the army: I did not know the qualificati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> it required.

<P>The officer thus replied, "your state is that of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> very worldly, irreligious man. The <HI>great family</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou served is a just picture of the WORLD.

The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngodly world, like your family, cares little for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>urch, and still less for prayers; and considers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Bible rather as an instrument to make an oath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nding, in order to keep the vulgar in obedi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce, than as containing in itself a perfect rule of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith and practice, and as a title-deed to heaven. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he generality of men love the world as you did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our service, while it smiles upon them, and gives <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>em easy work, and plenty of meat and drink; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> soon as it begins to cross and contradict them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ey get out of humour with it, just as you did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith your service.

The world, which takes no account of

<P>After some cross or opposition, worldly men, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I said before, begin to think how much content a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> cheerfulness they remember to have seen in religio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> people.

But the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> religious man, who has only seen the outside of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hristian in his worldly intercourse, knows little of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> secret conflicts, his trials, his self-denials, his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arfare with the world without, and with his own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rrupt desires within.</P>
<P>The irreligious man quarrels with the world, on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me such occasion as you did with your place. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> now puts on the outward forms and ceremo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es of religion, and assumes the badges of Chris∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nity, just as you were struck with the shows of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> field day; just as you were pleased with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>usic and the marching, and put on the cockade and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e red coat.
