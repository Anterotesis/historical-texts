<P>IT is but justice, my dear TOM, to ad∣dress to you a work which was begun with your approbation, carried on under your improving strictures, and has so often amused us during the many pleasing hours we have passed together.</P>
<P>At the same time that I own the many advantages I have reaped from making you confident to the productions of an idle and rural pen; let me not fail in my acknowlegements to our common friend the Hon.

<P>Would! would to Heaven that I was capable of adding the third to the number! But the grateful tribute of a

Sim∣plicity of manners, zealous friendship, the promotion of all liberal arts, uni∣versal benevolence, with its amiable at∣tendant charity, characterised the Prelate whose loss I deplore. You I know will excuse these expressions of sensibility, when you recollect it is Dr. LITTLETON, late Bishop of CARLISLE, whom I la∣ment.</P>

<HEAD>REPTILES.</HEAD>
<P>WE are now to consider the class of reptiles, which are, for the most part, objects of de∣testation; but however the opinion of the world may be, if a writer undertakes a general history of animals, he must include them: they form at lest one link in the chain of beings, and may therefore be viewed with a degree of pleasure by a philoso∣phic eye.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding the prejudice against this class is almost universal, is it founded on reason? In some it may be owned that the outward form is disagreeable, while the noxious qualities of others are justly productive of terror: but are we on that account to reject them? The more fatal they are, the more deeply we should enquire into their effects, that we may be capable of relieving those who are sufferers, and secure others from the same misfor∣tune. But if we duly weigh their noxious qualities, we shall, with our moral poet, find
<Q><HI>All partial evil universal good.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The teeth of wild beasts, and of serpents, are not only created as instruments of vengeance, but are salutary in lessening the numbers of those ani∣mals which are highly useful in the degree, and only hurtful in their excess; but if their bad qualities are serviceable, we are more indebted to their good ones than we chuse to acknowlege.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="8"/>But many of the animals that form this class are of immediate benefit to mankind. The Turtle, or Sea-Tortoise, supplies the torrid zone with a whole∣some and delicious food, as the epicures of our own country can attest. Frogs are a food in several parts, as Lizards and Serpents are in others.</P>
<P>The medicinal virtues of the Viper are partly ex∣ploded by the moderns, but time, the overthrower of systems, as well as empires, may restore it to the rank it held with the antients. The <HI>Lacerta Scincus</HI> is, however, yet esteemed in the <HI>East</HI> for its salubrious qualities, and even Toads have contri∣buted to the ease of patients in the most inveterate of all diseases.</P>
<P>Had I followed <HI>Linnaeus,</HI> and included the Carti∣laginous Fish in this class, there would have been ample room for panegyric, for it is very doubtful whether any are pernicious; but the uses of many, either as food or for mechanical purposes, were never questioned.</P>
<P>But if the external figure of the reptile tribe is disgusting, they have one general beauty, an apt configuration of parts for their way of life, nor are they destitute of their peculiar graces: the fine dis∣position of plates in the shell of the Tortoise, with the elegant symmetry of their colors, must strike even common observers, while the eye of the de∣spised Toad has a lustre denied to more pleasing forms. The frolicsome agility of Lizards enlivens the dried banks in hot climates, and the great affec∣tion which some of them shew to mankind, should farther engage our regard and attention.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="9"/>The wreathing of the Snake, with the vivid die of its skin, are certainly graceful, tho' from the dread of some particular species which are venemous, we have acquired an antipathy for the whole. The antients, who considered the Serpent as an emblem of health, could associate pleasing ideas with this animal. We therefore find it an ornament at every entertainment, and in every scene of mirth, both in painting and in sculpture. <HI>Virgil</HI> adopted this notion, and has accordingly described it with every beauty both of form and color,
<Q><L><HI>Adytis cum lubricus anguis ab imis</HI></L>
<L><HI>Septem ingens gyros, septena volumina traxit;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Amplexus placidé tumulum, lapsusque per aras:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Coeruleae cui terga notae, maculosus et auro</HI></L>
<L><HI>Squamam incendebat fulgor; ceu nubibus arcus</HI></L>
<L><HI>Mille trahit varios adverso sole calores.</HI></L>
<BIBL>V. 84.</BIBL></Q>
<Q><L>From the deep tomb, with many a shining fold,</L>
<L>An azure serpent rose, in scales that flam'd with gold:</L>
<L>Like heaven's bright bow his varying beauties shone</L>
<L>That draws a thousand colors from the sun:</L>
<L>Pleas'd round the altars and the tomb to wind,</L>
<L>His glittering length of volumes trails behind.</L>
<BIBL><HI>Pitt.</HI></BIBL></Q></P>
<P>But if after all some lively writer should pursue the Naturalists with more wit than argument, and more humor than good-nature, it should be endured with patience. Ridicule is, however, not the test of truth, tho' when joined to satyr, it seldom fails
<PB N="xii" REF="10"/>of seducing the many who had rather laugh than think. Should this prove the case in the present instance, let the author be allowed to skreen him∣self from censure, by saying he writes not to the many, but the few; to those alone who can examine the parts with a view to the <HI>whole,</HI> and who scorn to despise even the most deformed, or the most mi∣nute work of an all-wise CREATOR.</P>

<P>THIS species (if the <HI>testudo coriacea</HI>) seems com∣mon to the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> and to our southern seas, and is not, as far as we know, discovered in any other.</P>
<P>Two were taken on the coast of <HI>Cornwall</HI> in the mackrel nets, of a vast size, a little after <HI>Midsum∣mer</HI> 1756; the largest weighed eight hundred pounds, the lesser near seven hundred.</P>
<P>Doctor <HI>Borlase</HI> first published these animals to the world, and discovered them in our seas.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="12"/>He describes them as having seven spiny or ser∣rated ridges running from the head to the tail, di∣viding the upper part of the back into equal parts.</P>
<P>The fore legs, as appear by his figure, are remark∣ably long and narrow, flat, smooth, and fleshy, being destitute of scales. The color of their upper side bluish, their under side, as well as that of the neck, ruddy, speckled with black.</P>
<P>We suspect an error in the number of the hind legs, the figure being represented with four, an ex∣cess we never have met with in any of this genus.</P>
<P>The head is painted extremely small, in propor∣tion to the size of the animal, whose length was six feet nine inches, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Size.</NOTE> and breadth from the tip of one fore leg to that of the other ten feet four inches.</P>
<P>The covering of this species is compared to that of the <HI>Testudo coriacea</HI> of <HI>Rondeletius,</HI> which has an integument resembling a tough strong hide; and what is very singular, neither that of the <HI>Cornish</HI> spe∣cies, nor yet that of the <HI>French</HI> naturalist, seem by the figures to be divided into angular compartments by transverse sutures, like the shells of all tortoises we have ever met with. But the history of this kind remains still very obscure: it is therefore to be wish∣ed, that particular attention be paid to the next that is taken on our coasts; and that observation be made whether the covering is crustaceous or coriaceous, that we may be assured that these were the <HI>European</HI> kind, not the <HI>American;</HI> it seeming not improbable but they might be a couple that had escaped out of some <HI>West India</HI> ship that had foundered, or been cast away near the <HI>Cornish</HI> coast.</P>

</LIST>
<P>SO common and well-known an animal requires no description; but some of its properties are so singular that we cannot pass them unnoticed.</P>
<P>Its spring or power of taking large leaps is remark∣ably great, and it is the best swimmer of all four-footed animals. Nature hath finely adapted its parts for those ends, the fore members of the body being very lightly made, the hind legs and thighs very long, and furnished with very strong muscles.</P>
<P>While in a tadpole state it is entirely a water-ani∣mal; the work of generation is performed in that element, as may be seen in every pond during spring; when the female remains oppressed by the male for a number of days.</P>
<P>The work of propagation is extremely singular, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Genera∣tion.</NOTE> it being certain that the frog has not a <HI>penis intrans;</HI> there appears a strong analogy in this case between a certain class of the vegetable kingdom and those
<PB N="4" REF="14"/>animals; for it is well known, that when the female frog deposits its spawn, the male instantaneously im∣pregnates it with what we may call a <HI>farina foecundans,</HI> in the same manner as the male <HI>Palm</HI> tree conveys fructification to the flowers of the female, which would otherwise be barren <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Shaw's Travels, <HI>224.</HI> Hasselquist Trav. Engl. Ed. <HI>416.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>As soon as the frogs are released from their tad∣pole state they immediately take to land; and if the weather has been hot, and there fall any refreshing showers, you may see the ground for a considerable space perfectly blackened by Myriads of these ani∣malcules, seeking for some secure lurking places. Some philosophers <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Rondeletius, <HI>216.</HI> Wormii Mus. <HI>327.</HI></NOTE> not giving themselves time to examine into this phaenomenon, imagined them to have been generated in the clouds, and showered on the earth; but had they, like our <HI>Derham,</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ray's Wisdom Creat. <HI>316.</HI></NOTE> but traced them to the next pool, they would have found a better solution of the difficulty.</P>
<P>As frogs adhere closely to the backs of their own species, so we know they will do the same by fish: <HI>Walton</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Complete Angler, <HI>161.</HI></NOTE> mentions a strange story of their destroying pike; but that they will injure, if not entirely kill carp, is a fact indisputable, from the following rela∣tion: a very few years ago on fishing a pond belong∣ing to Mr. <HI>Pit,</HI> of <HI>Encomb, Dorsetshire,</HI> great num∣bers of the carp were found each with a frog mount∣ed on it, the hind legs clinging to the back, the fore legs fixed in the corner of each eye of the fish, which were thin and greatly wasted, teized by car∣rying
<PB N="5" REF="15"/>so disagreeable a load. These frogs we ima∣gine to have been males disappointed of a mate.</P>
<P>The croaking of frogs is well known, and from that in fenny countries they are distinguished by lu∣dicrous titles, thus they are stiled <HI>Dutch Nightingales</HI> and <HI>Boston Waites;</HI> even the <HI>Stygian</HI> frogs have not escaped notice, for <HI>Aristophanes</HI> hath gone farther, and formed a chorus of them.</P>

<P>Yet there is a time of year when they become mute, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Periodi∣cal Si∣lence.</NOTE> neither croaking nor opening their mouths for a whole month: this happens in the hot season, and that is in many places known to the country people by the name of the <HI>Paddock Moon.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Morton</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Hist. Northampt. <HI>441.</HI></NOTE> endeavours to find a reason for their silence, but tho' his facts are true, he is unfortunate in his philosophy. Frogs are certainly endued (as he well observed) with a power of living a good while under water without respiration, which is owing to their lungs being composed of a series of bladders: but he mistakes the nature of air, when he affirms that they receive a quantity of cool air, and dare not open their mouths for a month, from a dread of admitting a warmer into their lungs. It is hardly necessary to say, that in whatever state the air was received, it
<PB N="6" REF="16"/>would assimilate itself to the external atmosphere in a short time. We must leave the fact to be ac∣counted for by farther experiments. But from what we do know, we may partly vindicate <HI>Theophras∣tus,</HI> and other antients, about the silence of the frogs at <HI>Seriphus.</HI> That philosopher affirms it, but as∣cribes it to the coldness of the waters in that island: Now when Monsieur <HI>Tournefort</HI> was there, the wa∣ters were lukewarm, and the frogs had recovered their voices. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tournefort's voy. <HI>I. 142.</HI></NOTE> Is it not probable that <HI>Theophrastus</HI> might be at <HI>Seriphus</HI> at that season when the frogs were mute, and having never observed it elsewhere, might conclude their silence to be general as to the time, but particular as to the place. <HI>Aelian</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Aelian lib. <HI>iii.</HI> ch. <HI>35, 37.</HI></NOTE>, who quotes <HI>Theophrastus</HI> for the last passage, ascribes the same silence to the frogs of the lake <HI>Pierus</HI> in <HI>Thes∣saly,</HI> and about <HI>Cyrene</HI> in <HI>Africa:</HI> but he is so un∣certain a writer, that we cannot affirm whether the species of the <HI>African</HI> frogs is the same with ours.</P>
<P>These, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Food.</NOTE> as well as all other reptiles, feed but a small space of the year. The food of this genus is flies, insects, and snails. Toads are said to feed also on bees, and to do great injury to those useful in∣sects.</P>
<P>During winter frogs and toads remain in a torpid state: the last of which will dig into the earth and cover themselves with almost the same agility as the mole.</P>

<P>THE most deformed and hideous of all ani∣mals; the body broad, the back flat, and co∣vered with a pimply dusky hide; the belly large,
<PB N="8" REF="18"/>swagging, and swelling out; the legs short, and its pace labored and crawling: its retreat gloomy and filthy: in short, its general appearance is such as to strike one with disgust and horror; yet we have been told by those who have resolution to view it with at∣tention, that its eyes are fine: to this it seems that <HI>Shakespear</HI> alludes, when he makes his <HI>Juliet</HI> remark, Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes. As if they would have been better bestowed on so charming a songster than on this raucous reptile.</P>
<P>But the hideous appearance of the toad is such as to make this one advantageous feature overlooked, and to have rendered it in all ages an object of hor∣ror, and the origin of most tremendous inventions. <HI>Aelian</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. an. lib. <HI>ix.</HI> c. <HI>11.</HI></NOTE> makes its venom so potent, that <HI>Basilisk</HI>-like it conveyed death by its very look and breath; but <HI>Juvenal</HI> is content with making the <HI>Roman</HI> ladies, who were weary of their husbands, form a potion from its entrails, <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Sat. <HI>vi. 658.

<P>This opinion begat others of a more dreadful na∣ture; for in after-times superstition gave it preterna∣tural
<PB N="9" REF="19"/>powers, and made it a principal ingredient in the incantations of nocturnal hags:
<Q><L>Toad that under the cold stone,</L>

<P>This shews the mighty powers attributed to this animal by the dealers in the magic art; but the powers our poet indues it with, are far superior to those than <HI>Gesner</HI> ascribes to it: <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s witches used it to disturb the dead; <HI>Gesner</HI>'s, only to still the living, <HI>Ut vim coeundi ni fallor, in viris tollerent.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. quad. ovip. <HI>72.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>We may add here another superstition in respect to this animal: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Toad∣stone.</NOTE> it was believed by some old writers to have a stone in its head, fraught with great vir∣tues medical and magical: it was distinguished by the name of the Reptile, and called the <HI>Toad-Stone, Bufo∣nites, Crapaudine, Krottenstein;</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Boet. de Boot. de Lap. et Gam. <HI>301.303.</HI></NOTE> but all its fancied powers vanished on the discovery of its being nothing but the fossil tooth of the <HI>sea wolf,</HI> or of some flat∣toothed fish, not unfrequent in our island, as well as several other countries; but we may well excuse this tale, since <HI>Shakespear</HI> has extracted from it a simile of uncommon beauty:
<PB N="10" REF="20"/>
<Q><L>Sweet are the uses of adversity,</L>
<L>Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,</L>
<L>Wears yet a precious jewel in his head.</L></Q></P>
<P>But these fables have been long exploded: we shall now return to the notion of its being a poison∣ous animal, and deliver as our opinion, that its ex∣cessive deformity, joined to the faculty it has of emitting a juice from its pimples, and a dusky li∣quid from its hind parts, is the foundation of the report.</P>
<P>That it has any noxious qualities we have been unable to bring proofs in the smallest degree satis∣factory, tho' we have heard many strange relations on that point.</P>
<P>On the contrary, we know several of our friends who have taken them in their naked hands, and held them long without receiving the lest injury: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Not poi∣sonous.</NOTE> It is also well known that quacks have eaten them, and have besides squeezed their juices into a glass, and drank them with impunity.</P>
<P>We may say also, that these reptiles are a common food to many animals; to <HI>buzzards, owls, Norfolk plovers, ducks,</HI> and <HI>snakes,</HI> who would not touch them were they in any degree noxious.</P>
<P>So far from having venomous qualities, they have of late been considered as if they had beneficent ones. We wish, for the benefit of mankind, that we could make a favorable report of the many at∣tempts of late to cure the most terrible of diseases the <HI>cancer,</HI> by the application of live toads; but,
<PB N="11" REF="21"/>alas, they seem only to have rendered a horrible complaint more loathsome.</P>
<P>In a word, we may consider the toad as an animal that has neither good nor harm in it; that being a defenceless creature, nature has furnished it, instead of arms, with a most disgusting deformity, that strikes into almost every Being capable of annoying it, a strong repugnancy to meddle with so hideous and threatening an appearance.</P>
<P>The time of their propagation is very early in the spring: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Genera∣tion.</NOTE> at that season the females are seen crawl∣ing about oppressed by the males, who continue on them for some hours, and adhere so fast as to tear the very skin from the Parts they stick to. We are uncertain whether they are viviparous: <HI>Linnoeus</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Syst. Nat. <HI>355.</HI></NOTE> says they are, and diverts us with a report he had heard, that the male acts the midwife to the female in parturition.</P>
<P>To conclude this account with the marvellous, this animal is said to have often been found in the midst of solid rocks, and even in the centre of growing trees, imprisoned in a small hollow, to which there was not the least adit or entrance <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Plot'<HI>s</HI> Hist. Staff. <HI>247.</HI></NOTE>: how the ani∣mal breathed, or how it subsisted (supposing the possibility of its confinement) is past our compre∣hension. <HI>Plot</HI>'s <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P. <HI>249.</HI></NOTE> solution of this phaenomenon is far from satisfactory; yet as we have the great <HI>Bacon</HI>'s <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Nat.

<P>THOSE we have seen differ in color, but agree in all other respects with the species described by Doctor <HI>Plot.</HI> Their length from the nose to the hind legs was three inches; from thence to the end of the tail three and three quarters.</P>
<P>Along the back was a black list; each side of that a brown one: then succeeded a narrow stripe, spot∣ted alternately yellow and brown; beneath that a broad black one; those ended a little beyond the hind legs. The belly was yellow, and the scales large but even. The scales on the back small; on the tail the ends projected: those on the latter were varied with black and brown.</P>
<P>The legs and feet were dusky; on each foot were five toes, furnished with claws.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="25"/>This species is extremely nimble: in hot weather it basks on the sides of dry banks, or of old trees; but on being observed immediately retreats to its hole.</P>
<P>The food of this species, as of all the other <HI>English</HI> lizards, is insects: they themselves of birds of prey. Each of our lizards are perfectly harmless; yet their form is what strikes one with disgust, and has occa∣sioned great obscurity in their history.</P>
<P>Related to this species is the <HI>Guernsey</HI> lizard, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Other species.</NOTE> which we are informed has been propagated in <HI>England</HI> from some originally brought from that island. We have also heard of a green lizard frequent near <HI>Farn∣bam,</HI> which probably may be of that kind: but the most uncommon species we ever met with any ac∣count of, is that which was killed near <HI>Woscot,</HI> in the parish of <HI>Swinford, Worcestershire,</HI> in 1741, which was two feet six inches long, and four inches in girth. The fore legs were placed eight inches from the head; the hind legs five inches beyond those: the legs two inches long: the feet divided into four toes, each furnished with a sharp claw. Another was killed at <HI>Penbury,</HI> in the same county. Whe∣ther these are not of exotic descent, and whether the breed continues, is what we are at present unin∣formed of.</P>

<P>THE length of this species was six inches and an half, of which the tail was three and a quarter.</P>
<P>The irides yellow: the head and beginning of the back flat, and covered with small pimples or warts, of a dark dusky color; the sides with white ones: the belly, and the side of the tail, was of a bright yel∣low; the first spotted with black.</P>
<P>The tail was compressed sideways, and very thin towards the upper edge, and slender towards the end.</P>
<P>The fore feet divided into four toes; the hind in∣to five; all without nails, dusky spotted with yellow.</P>
<P>Its pace is slow and crawling.</P>
<P>This species we have frequently seen in the state we describe, but are uncertain whether we ever met with it under the form of a <HI>larve.</HI> We have more than once found under stones and old logs, some very minute young lizards that had much the appear∣ance of this kind: they were perfectly formed, and had not the least vestiges of fins; so that circum∣stance joined to their being found in a dry place, re∣mote from water, makes us imagine them to have
<PB N="16" REF="27"/>never been inhabitants of that element, as it is cer∣tain many of our lizards are in their first state.</P>
<P>At that period they have a fin above and below their tail; that on the upper part extends along the back as far as the head, but both drop off as soon as the animal takes to the land, being then no lon∣ger of any use.</P>
<P>Besides these circumstances that attend them in form of a <HI>larve,</HI> Mr. <HI>Ellis</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phil.

<P>VIPERS are found in many parts of this island, but the dry, stony, and, in particular, the chalky countries abound with them.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="29"/>They are viviparous, not but that they are hatch∣ed from an internal egg; being of that class of ani∣mals, of whose generation <HI>Aristotle</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Gen. an. lib. <HI>iii.</HI> c. <HI>2.</HI></NOTE> says, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>i. e.</HI> They conceive a perfect egg within, but bring forth their young alive.</P>
<P>Providence is extremely kind in making this spe∣cies far from being prolific, we having never heard of more than eleven eggs being found in one viper, and those are as if chained together, and each about the size of a blackbird's egg.</P>
<P>The viper grows seldom to a greater length than two feet; tho' once we saw a female (which is nearly a third larger than the male) which was almost three feet long.</P>
<P>The ground-color of this serpent is a dirty yellow; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Descr.</NOTE> that of the female deeper. Its back is marked the whole length with a series of rhomboid black spots, touching each other at the points; the sides with triangular ones; the belly entirely black.</P>
<P>There is a variety wholly black; but the rhom∣boid marks are very conspicuous even in this, being of a deeper and more glossy hue than the rest. <HI>Pe∣tiver</HI> calls it the <HI>Vipera Anglica Nigricans. Pet. Mus. No.</HI> 204. <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot"><HI>Coluber Prester.</HI> Lin. syst. <HI>377. Bose.</HI> Faun. suec. No. <HI>287.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>The head of the viper is inflanted, which distin∣guishes it from the common snake. The tongue forked; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Teeth.</NOTE> the teeth small; the four canine teeth are placed two on each side the upper jaw: these instruments of poison are long, crooked, and
<PB N="19" REF="30"/>moveable, and can be raised and depressed at plea∣sure; they are hollow from near the point to their base, near which is a gland that secretes, prepares, and lodges the poison; and the same action that gives the wounds, forces from this gland, thro' the tooth, the fatal juice into it.</P>
<P>These islands may be particularly thankful for the blessing they enjoy, in being possessed of only one venomous animal, and that of a kind which encreases so little.</P>
<P>They copulate in <HI>May,</HI> and are supposed to be about three months before they bring forth.</P>
<P>They are said not to arrive at their full growth in less than six or seven years; but that they are ca∣pable of engendering at two or three.</P>
<P>We have been often assured by intelligent people of the truth of a fact mentioned by Sir <HI>Thomas Brown,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vulgar errors, <HI>114.</HI></NOTE> who was far from a credulous writer, that the young of the viper, when terrified, will run down the throat of the parent, and seek shelter in its belly in the same manner as the young of the <HI>oppossum</HI> retire into the ventral pouch of the old one.</P>
<P>From this some have imagined that the viper is so unnatural as to devour its own young; we disbelieve the fact, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Food.</NOTE> it being well known the food of these ser∣pents is frogs, toads, lizards, mice, and, according to Doctor <HI>Mead,</HI> even an animal so large as a mole. These they swallow entire; which if we consider the narrowness of their neck, shews it is capable of a distension hardly credible, had we not ocular proofs of the fact.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="31"/>It is also said, from good authority, that they will prey on young birds; whether on such as nestle on the ground, or whether they climb up trees for them as the <HI>Indian</HI> serpents do, we are quite uncer∣tain; but we are well assured that this discovery is far from a recent one:
<Q><L><HI>Ut assidens implumibus pullis avis</HI></L>
<L><HI>Serpentium allapsus timet</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hor. Epod. <HI>I.</HI></NOTE></L>
<L>Thus, for its young the anxious bird</L>
<L>The gliding serpent fears.</L></Q></P>
<P>The viper is capable of supporting very long ab∣stinence, it being known that some have been kept in a box six months without food, yet did not abate of their vivacity. They feed only a small part of the year, but never during their confinement; for if mice, their favorite diet, should at that time be thrown into their box, tho' they will kill, yet they never will eat them.</P>
<P>The poison decreases in violence in proportion to the length of their confinement: it must be also added the virtues of its flesh (whatsoever they be) are at the same time considerably lessened.</P>
<P>These animals, when at liberty, remain torpid throughout the winter; yet when confined have never been observed to take their annual repose.</P>
<P>The method of catching them is by putting a clift stick on or near their head; after which they are seized by the tail, and put instantly into a bag.</P>
<P>The viper-catchers are very frequently bit by them in the pursuit of their business, yet we very rarely
<PB N="21" REF="32"/>hear of the bite being fatal. The remedy, if ap∣plied in time, is very certain, and is nothing else but sallad oil, which the viper-catchers seldom go with∣out. The <HI>axungia viperina,</HI> or the fat of vipers, is also another. Doctor <HI>Mead</HI> suspects the efficacy of this last, and substitutes one of his own in its place <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Essay on Poisons, <HI>47.</HI></NOTE>; but we had rather trust to vulgar receipts which per∣petual trials have shewn to be infallible.</P>
<P>The symptoms of the venom, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Effects of its bite.</NOTE> if the wound is neglected, are very terrible: it first causes an acute pain in the place affected, attended with a swelling, first red, afterwards livid, which by degrees spreads to the neighbouring parts; great faintness, and a quick tho' low and interrupted pulse ensue; great sickness at the stomach, bilious convulsive vomitings, cold sweats, and sometimes pains about the navel; and in consequence of these death itself <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Lib. <HI>xxix.</HI> c. <HI>3.</HI></NOTE>. But the violence of the symptoms depends much on the season of the year, the difference of the climate, the size or rage of the animal, or the depth or situation of the wound.</P>
<P>Dreadful as the effects of its bite may be, yet its flesh has been long celebrated as a noble medicine. Doctor <HI>Mead</HI> cites from <HI>Pliny, Galen,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Uses.</NOTE> and other an∣tients, several proofs of its efficacy in the cure of <HI>ulcers,</HI> the <HI>elephantiasis,</HI> and other bad complaints. He even says he has seen good effects from it in an obstinate <HI>lepra:</HI> it is at present used as a restorative, tho' we think the modern physicians have no great dependence on its virtues. The antients prescribed
<PB N="22" REF="33"/>it boiled, and to be eaten as fish; for when fresh, the medicine was much more likely to take effect than when dried, and given in form of a powder or troche.</P>
<P>The antient <HI>Britons</HI> had a strange superstition in respect to these animals, and of which there still remains in <HI>Wales</HI> a strong tradition. The account <HI>Pliny</HI> gives of it is as follows: we shall not attempt a translation, it being already done to our hands in a spirited manner by the ingenious Mr. <HI>Mason,</HI> which we shall take the liberty of borrowing.</P>

<P>THE snake is the largest of the <HI>English</HI> ser∣pents, sometimes exceeding four feet in length: the neck is slender; the middle of the body thickest; the back and sides covered with small scales, the belly with oblong, narrow, transverse plates. The first <HI>Linnaeus</HI> distinguishes by the name of <HI>squamae,</HI> the last he calls <HI>scuta,</HI> and from them forms his ge∣nera of serpents.</P>
<P>Those that have both <HI>squamae</HI> and <HI>scuta</HI> he calls <HI>Colubri;</HI> those that have only <HI>squamae, Angues.</HI> The viper and snake are comprehended in the first genus, the blind-worm under the second; but we chuse (to avoid multiplying our genera) to take in the few serpents we have by a single genus, their marks being too evident to be confounded.</P>
<P>The color of the back and sides of the snake are dusky or brown; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Descr.</NOTE> the middle of the back marked with two rows of small black spots running from head to tail; and from them are multitudes of lines of spots crossing the sides; the plates on the belly are dusky, the scales on the sides of a bluish white.</P>
<P>On each side the neck is a spot of pale yellow, and the base of each is a triangular black spot, one angle of which points towards the tail.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="36"/>The teeth are small and serrated, lying each side the jaw in two rows.</P>
<P>This species is perfectly inoffensive; it frequents and lodges itself among bushes in moist places, and will readily take the water, swimming very well.</P>
<P>It preys on frogs, insects, worms, and mice, and, considering the smallness of the neck, it is amazing how large an animal it will swallow.</P>
<P>The snake is oviparous: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Eggs.</NOTE> it lays its eggs in dung∣hills, and in hot-beds, whose heat, aided by that of the sun, promotes the exclusion of the young.</P>

<P>THE usual length of this species is eleven inches: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Descr.</NOTE> the irides are red; the head small; the neck still more slender; from that part the body grows suddenly, and continues of an equal bulk to the tail, which ends quite blunt.</P>
<P>The color of the back is cinereous, marked with very small lines composed of minute black specks; the sides are of a reddish cast; the belly dusky, both marked like the back.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="37"/>The tongue is broad and forky; the teeth mi∣nute, but numerous; the scales small.</P>
<P>The motion of this ferpent is slow, from which, and from the smallness of the eyes, are derived its names. Like others of the genus, it lies torpid du∣ring winter, and are sometimes found in vast num∣bers twisted together.</P>
<P>Like the former it is quite innocent. Doctor <HI>Bor∣lase</HI> mentions a variety of this serpent with a pointed tail; and adds, that he was informed that a man lost his life by the bite of one in <HI>Oxfordshire.</HI> We are inclined to think that his informant mistook the black or dusky viper for this kind; for excepting the viper, we never could learn that there was any sort of poisonous serpent in these kingdoms.</P>

<HEAD>Div. I. CETACEOUS FISH.</HEAD>
<P>NATURE on this tribe hath bestowed an in∣ternal structure in all respects agreeing with that of quadrupeds; and in a few other the external parts in both are similar.</P>
<P>Cetaceous Fish, like land animals, breathe by means of lungs, being destitute of gills. This obliges them to rise frequently to the surface of the water to respire, to sleep on the surface, as well as to perform several other functions.</P>
<P>They have the power of uttering sounds, such as bellowing and making other noises, a faculty denied to genuine fish <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pontop. Hist. Norw. <HI>ii. 123.</HI> Blasius Anat. Animal, <HI>288.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>Like land animals they have warm blood, are fur∣nished with organs of generation, copulate, bring forth, and suckle their young, shewing a strong at∣tachment to them.</P>
<P>Their bodies beneath the skin are entirely sur∣rounded with a thick layer of fat (blubber) analo∣gous to the lard on hogs.</P>
<P>The number of their fins never exceeds three, <HI>viz.</HI> two pectoral fins, and one back fin; but in some species the last is wanting.</P>
<P>Their tails are placed horizontally or flat in respect to their bodies; contrary to the direction of those of all other fish, which have them in a perpendicular site. This situation of the tail enables them to force themselves suddenly to the surface of the water
<PB N="34" REF="48"/>to breathe, which they are so frequently constrained to do.</P>
<P>Many of these circumstances induced <HI>Linnoeus</HI> to place this tribe among his <HI>Mammalia,</HI> or what other writers style quadrupeds.</P>
<P>To have preserved the chain of beings entire, he should in this case have made the genus of <HI>Phocoe,</HI> or <HI>Seals,</HI> and that of the <HI>Trichecus</HI> or <HI>Manati,</HI> imme∣diately precede the whale, those being the links that connect the <HI>Mammalia</HI> or quadrupeds with the fish; for the <HI>Seal</HI> is, in respect to its legs, the most imper∣fect of the former class; and in the <HI>Manati</HI> the hind feet coalesce, assuming the form of a broad horizon∣tal tail.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the many parts and properties which cetaceous fish have in common with land ani∣mals, yet there still remain others, that in a natural arrangement of the animal kingdom, must determine us after the example of the illustrious <HI>Ray</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Who makes two divisions of fish.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 <HI>Pulmone respirantes.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2 <HI>Branchiis respirantes.</HI></ITEM>

<P>That the form of their bodies agrees with that of fish.</P>

<P>They live entirely in the water, and have all the actions of fish.</P>

<P>THIS species is the largest of all animals: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Size.</NOTE> it is even at present sometimes found in the north∣ern seas ninety feet in length; but formerly they were taken of a much greater size, when the captures were less frequent, and the fish had time to grow. Such is their bulk within the <HI>arctic</HI> circle, but in those of the <HI>torrid</HI> zone, where they are unmolested, whales are still seen one hundred and sixty feet long <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Adanson's voy.</HI> 174. From this account we find no reason to disbelieve the vast size of the <HI>Indian</HI> whales, of whose bones and jaws, both <HI>Strabo, lib.</HI> xv. and <HI>Pliny, lib.</HI> ix. <HI>c.</HI> 3. relate, that the natives made their houses, using the jaws for door-cases. This method of building was formerly practised by the inha∣bitants of <HI>Greenland,</HI> as we find from <HI>Frobisher,</HI> in his second voyage, p. 18, published in 1578.</NOTE></P>
<P>The head is very much disproportioned to the size of the body, being one-third the size of the fish: the under lip is much broader than the upper. The tongue is composed of a soft spongy fat, capable of
<PB N="36" REF="50"/>yielding five or six barrels of oil. The gullet is very small for so vast a fish, not exceeding four inches in width. In the middle of the head are two orifices, thro' which it spouts water to a vast height, and with a great noise, especially when disturbed or wounded.</P>
<P>The eyes are no larger than those of an ox.</P>
<P>On the back there is no fin, but on the sides, be∣neath each eye, are two large ones.</P>
<P>The penis is eight feet in length, inclosed in a strong sheath. The teats in the female are placed in the lower part of the belly.</P>
<P>The tail is broad and semilunar.</P>
<P>This whale varies in color: the back of some being red, the belly generally white. Others are black, some mottled, others quite white, according to the observations of <HI>Marten,</HI> who says, that their colors in the water are extremely beautiful, and that their skin is very smooth and slippery.</P>
<P>What is called <HI>whalebone</HI> adheres to the upper jaw, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Whale∣bone.</NOTE> and is formed of thin parallel laminae, some of the longest four yards in length; of these there are com∣monly 350 on each side, but in very old fish more; of these about 500 are of a length fit for use, the others being too short. They are surrounded with long strong hair, not only that they may not hurt the tongue, but as strainers to prevent the return of their food when they discharge the water out of their mouths.</P>
<P>It is from these hairs that <HI>Aristotle</HI> gave the name of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or the <HI>bearded whale,</HI> to this species, which he tells us had in its mouth hairs instead of
<PB N="37" REF="51"/>teeth <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Hist. an lib. <HI>iii.</HI> c. <HI>12.</HI></NOTE>; and <HI>Pliny</HI> describes the same under the name of <HI>Musculus</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Lib. <HI>xi.</HI> c. <HI>37.</HI></NOTE>. Tho' the antients were acquainted with this animal, yet as far as we recollect, they were ignorant of their uses as well as capture.</P>
<P><HI>Aldrovand</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">De Cetis. <HI>261.</HI></NOTE> indeed describes from <HI>Oppian,</HI> what he mistakes for whale fishing: he was deceived by the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which is used not only to express whale in general, but any great fish. The <HI>poet</HI> here meant the <HI>shark,</HI> and shews the way of taking it in the very manner practised at present, by a strong hook baited with flesh. He describes too its three-fold row of teeth, a circumstance that at once disproves its being a whale:

<Q><L>Whose dreadful teeth in triple order stand,</L>
<L>Like spears out of his mouth.</L></Q></P>
<P>The whale, tho' so bulky an animal, swims with vast swiftness, and generally against the wind.</P>
<P>It brings only two young at a time, as we believe is the case with all other whales.</P>
<P>Its food is a certain sort of small snail, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Food.</NOTE> and as <HI>Lin∣noeus</HI> says, the <HI>medusa,</HI> or sea blubber.</P>
<P>The great resort of this species is within the <HI>arctic</HI> circle, but they sometimes visit our coasts. Whether this was the <HI>British</HI> whale of the antients we cannot pretend to say, only we find, from a line in <HI>Juvenal,</HI> that it was of a very large size,
<PB N="38" REF="52"/>

<BIBL>Sat. x.</BIBL></Q>
<Q><L>As much as <HI>British</HI> whales in size surpass</L>
<L>The dolphin race.</L></Q></P>
<P>To view these animals in a commercial light, we must add, that the <HI>English</HI> were late before they en∣gaged in the whale-fishery: it appears by a set of queries, proposed by an honest merchant in the year 1575, in order to get information in the business, that we were at that time totally ignorant of it, be∣ing obliged to send to <HI>Biskaie for men skilful in the catching of the whale, and ordering of the oil, and one cooper skilful to set up the staved cask</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hackluyt'<HI>s</HI> Col. voy. <HI>I. 414.</HI></NOTE> This seems very strange; for by the account <HI>Octher</HI> gave of his travels to King <HI>Alfred,</HI> near 700 years <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Idem <HI>I. 4.</HI></NOTE> before that period, it is evident that he made that monarch ac∣quainted with the <HI>Norwegians</HI> practising the whale-fishery; but it seems all memory of that gainful employ, as well as of that able voyager <HI>Octher,</HI> and all his important discoveries in the North were lost for near seven centuries.</P>
<P>It was carried on by the <HI>Biscayeners</HI> long before we attempted the trade, and that for the sake not only of the oil, but also of the whalebone, which they seem to have long trafficked in. The earliest notice we find of that article in our trade is by <HI>Hackluyt</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hackluyt <HI>III. 194.</HI></NOTE>, who says it was brought from the <HI>Bay of St. Lau∣rence</HI> by an <HI>English</HI> ship that went there for the <HI>barbes</HI> and <HI>fynnes</HI> of whales and train oil, A. D. 1594, and who found there seven or eight hundred <HI>whale</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="53"/><HI>fynnes,</HI> part of the cargo of two great <HI>Biskaine</HI> ships that had been wrecked there three years before. Previous to that, the ladies stays must have been made of split cane or some tough wood, as Mr. <HI>An∣derson</HI> observes in his Dictionary of Commerce <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. <HI>I. 442.</HI></NOTE>, it being certain that the whale fishery was carried on, for the sake of the oil, long before the discovery of the use of whalebone.</P>
<P>The great resort of these animals was found to be on the inhospitable shores of <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> and the <HI>European</HI> ships made that place their principal fishery, and for numbers of years were very successful: the <HI>English</HI> commenced that business about the year 1598, and the town of <HI>Hull</HI> had the honor of first attempting that profitable branch of trade. At present it seems to be on the decline, the quantity of fish being greatly reduced by the constant capture for such a vast length of time: some recent ac∣counts inform us, that the fishers, from a defect of whales, apply themselves to the seal fishery, from which animals they extract an oil. This we fear will not be of any long continuance; for these shy and timid creatures will soon be induced to quit those shores by being perpetually harrassed, as the <HI>morse</HI> or <HI>walrus</HI> has already in a great measure done. We are also told, that the poor natives of <HI>Green∣land</HI> begin even now to suffer from the decrease of the seal in their seas, it being their principal subsist∣ence; so that should it totally desert the coast, the whole nation would be in danger of perishing thro' want.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="54"/>In old times the whale seems never to have been taken on our coasts, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Royal Fish.</NOTE> but when it was accidentally flung ashore: it was then deemed a royal fish <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Item habet warectum maris per totum regnum <HI>Ballenas</HI> et <HI>Sturgiones</HI> captos, &amp;c. <HI>Edwardi</HI> II. <HI>anno 17mo.</HI></NOTE>, and the king and queen divided the spoil; the king asserting his right to the head, her majesty to the tail <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Blackston<HI>'s</HI> Com. <HI>I.</HI> c. <HI>4.</HI></NOTE></P>

<P>THIS species is distinguished from the common whale by a fin on the back, placed very low and near the tail.</P>
<P>The length is equal to that of the common kind, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Descr.</NOTE> but much more slender. It is furnished with whale∣bone in the upper jaw, mixed with hairs, but short and knotty, and of little value. The blubber also on the body of this kind is very inconsiderable: these circumstances, added to its extreme fierceness and agility, which renders the capture very dangerous, cause the fishers to neglect it. The natives of <HI>Green∣land</HI> tho' hold it in great esteem, as it affords a quantity of flesh, which to their palate is very agree∣able.</P>
<P>The lips are brown, and like a twisted rope: the spout hole is as it were split in the top of its head, thro' which it blows water with much more violence, and to a greater height, than the common whale.

<P>HISTORIANS and philosophers seem to have contended who should invent most fables concerning this fish. It was consecrated to the Gods, was celebrated in the earliest time for its fondness of the human race, was honored with the title of the
<PB N="49" REF="64"/><HI>Sacred Fish</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Athenoeus, <HI>281.</HI></NOTE>, and distinguished by those of <HI>Boy∣loving,</HI> and <HI>Philanthropist.</HI> It gave rise to a long train of inventions, proofs of the credulity and ig∣norance of the times.</P>
<P><HI>Aristotle</HI> steers the clearest of all the antients from these fables, and gives in general so faithful a natu∣ral history of this animal, as evinces the superior judgment of that great philosopher, in comparison of those who succeeded him. But the elder <HI>Pliny, Aelian,</HI> and others, seem to preserve no bounds in their belief of the tales related of this fish's attach∣ment to mankind.</P>
<P><HI>Pliny</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Epist. lib. <HI>ix.</HI> ep. <HI>33.</HI></NOTE> the younger, (apologizing for what he is going to say) tells the story of the enamoured dol∣phin of <HI>Hippo</HI> in a most beautiful manner. It is too long to be transcribed, and would be injured by an abridgement; therefore we refer the reader to the original, or to Mr. <HI>Melmouth</HI>'s elegant translation.</P>
<P>Scarce an accident could happen at sea but the dolphin offered himself to convey to shore the un∣fortunate. <HI>Arion,</HI> the musician, when flung into the ocean by the pyrates, is received and saved by this benevolent sish.</P>
<Q><L>Inde (side majus) tergo Delphina recurvo,</L>
<L>Se memorant oneri supposuisse novo.</L>
<L>Ille sedens citharamque tenens, pretiumque vehendi</L>

<Q><L>But (past belief) a dolphin's arched back,</L>
<L>Preserved <HI>Arion</HI> from his destined wrack;</L>
<L>Secure he sits, and with harmonious strains,</L>
<L>Requites his bearer for his friendly pains.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="50" REF="65"/>
We are at a loss to account for the origin of those fables, since it does not appear that the dolphin shews a greater attachment to mankind than the rest of the cetaceous tribe. We know that at present the ap∣pearance of this fish, and the porpesse, are far from being esteemed favorable omens by the seamen; for their boundings, springs and frolics in the water, are held to be sure signs of an approaching gale.</P>
<P>It is from their leaps out of that element that they assume a temporary form that is not natural to them, but which the old painters and sculptors have almost always given them. A dolphin is scarce ever exhibited by the antients in a strait shape, but almost always incurvated: such are those on the coin of <HI>Alexander the Great,</HI> which is preserved by <HI>Belon,</HI> as well as on several other pieces of antiquity. The poets describe them much in the same manner, and it is not improbable but that the one had borrowed from the other:
<Q><L>Tumidumque pando transilit dorso mare</L>
<L>Tyrrhenus omni piscis exsultat freto,</L>
<L>Agitatque gyros.</L>
<BIBL><HI>Senec. Trag. Agam.</HI> 450.</BIBL></Q>
<Q><L>Upon the swelling waves the dolphins shew</L>
<L>Their bended backs, then swiftly darting go,</L>
<L>And in a thousand wreaths their bodies throw.</L></Q></P>
<P>The natural shape of the dolphin is almost strait, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Descr.</NOTE> the back being very slightly incurvated, and the body slender: the nose is long, narrow, and point∣ed, not much unlike the beak of some birds, for which reason the <HI>French</HI> call it <HI>L' oye de mer.</HI></P>
<P>It has in all forty-two teeth, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Teeth.</NOTE> twenty-one in the upper jaws, and nineteen in the lower, a little above

<P>The spout hole is placed in the middle of the head.</P>
<P>The back fin is high, triangular, and placed ra∣ther nearer to the tail than to the head; the pectoral fins situated low.</P>
<P>The tail is semilunar.</P>
<P>The skin is smooth, the color of the back and sides dusky; the belly whitish.</P>
<P>It swims with great swiftness: its prey is fish.</P>
<P>It was formerly reckoned a great delicacy: Doc∣tor <HI>Caius</HI> says, that one which was taken in his time, was thought a present worthy the Duke of <HI>Nor-folk,</HI> who distributed part of it among his friends. It was roasted and dressed with porpesse sauce, made of crumbs of fine white bread, mixed with vinegar and sugar.</P>
<P>This species of dolphin must not be confounded with that to which seamen gives the name, the latter being quite another kind of fish, the <HI>Coryphoena, Hippuris</HI> of <HI>Linnoeus, p.</HI> 446. and the <HI>Dorado</HI> of the, <HI>Portuguese,</HI> described by <HI>Willoughby, p.</HI> 213.</P>

<P>THESE fish are found in vast multitudes in all parts of the sea that wash these islands, but in greatest numbers at the time when fish of pas∣sage appear, such as mackrel, herrings, and salmon, which they pursue up the bays with the same eager∣ness as a pack of dogs does a hare. In some places they almost darken the sea as they rise above water to take breath: but propesses not only seek for prey near the surface, but often descend to the bot∣tom in search of sand eels, and sea worms, which they root out of the sand with their noses in the same manner as hogs do in the fields for their food.</P>
<P>Their bodies are very thick towards the head, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Descr.</NOTE> but grows slender towards the tail, forming the figure of a cone.</P>
<P>The nose projects a little, is much shorter than that of the dolphin, and is furnished with very strong muscles, which enables it the readier to turn up the sand.</P>
<P>In each jaw are forty-eight teeth, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Teeth.</NOTE> small, sharp pointed, and a little moveable: like those of the dol∣phin,
<PB N="53" REF="69"/>they are so placed as that the teeth of one jaw locks into those of the other when closed.</P>
<P>The tongue is flat, pectinated at the edges, and fastened down to the bottom of the mouth.</P>
<P>The eyes small; the spout hole on the top of the the head.</P>
<P>On the back is one fin placed rather below the middle; on the breast are two fins. The tail semi∣lunar.</P>
<P>The color of the porpesse is generally black, and the belly whitish, not but they sometimes vary; for in the river <HI>St. Laurence</HI> there is a white kind; and Doctor <HI>Borlase,</HI> in his voyage to the <HI>Scilly</HI> isles, ob∣served a small species of cetaceous fish, which he calls <HI>thornbacks,</HI> from their broad and sharp fin on the back, some of these were brown, some quite white, others spotted: but whether they were only a variety of this fish, or whether they were small <HI>grampuses,</HI> which are also spotted, we cannot deter∣mine.</P>
<P>The porpesse is remarkable for the vast quantity of the fat or lard that surrounds the body, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fat.</NOTE> which yields a great quantity of excellent oil: from this lard, or from their rooting like swine, they are called in many places <HI>sea hogs;</HI> the <HI>Germans</HI> call them <HI>meerschwein;</HI> the <HI>Swedes, marsuin;</HI> and the <HI>English, porpesse,</HI> from the <HI>Italian, porco pesce.</HI></P>

<P>THIS species is found from the length of fifteen feet to that of twenty-five. It is remarkably thick in proportion to its length, one of eighteen feet being in the thickest place ten feet diameter.

<P>It is extremely voracious, and will not even spare the porpesse, a congenerous fish. It is said to be a great enemy to the whale, and that it will fasten on it like a dog on a bull, till the animal roars with pain.</P>
<P>The nose is flat, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Teeth.</NOTE> and turns up at the end. There are thirty teeth in each jaw; those before are blunt, round, and slender; the farthest sharp and thick: between each is a space adapted to receive the teeth of the opposite jaw when the mouth is closed.</P>
<P>The spout hole is in the top of the neck. In respect to the number and site of the fins, it agrees with the dolphin.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="71"/>The color of the back is black, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Color.</NOTE> but on each shoulder is a large white spot, the sides marbled with black and white, the belly of a snowy whiteness.</P>
<P>These sometimes appear on our coasts, but are found in much greater numbers off the <HI>North Cape</HI> in <HI>Norway,</HI> whence they are called <HI>North Capers.</HI> These and all other whales are observed to swim against the wind, and to be much disturbed, and tumble about with unusual violence at the approach of a storm.</P>
<P><HI>Linnoeus</HI> and <HI>Artedi</HI> say, that this species is fur∣nished with broad serrated teeth, which as far as we have observed, is peculiar to the <HI>shark</HI> tribe. We therefore suspect that those naturalists have had re∣course to <HI>Rondeletius,</HI> and copied his erroneous ac∣count of the teeth: Sir <HI>Robert Sibbald,</HI> who had opportunity of examining and figuring the teeth of this fish, and from whom we take that part of our description, giving a very different account of them.</P>
<P>It will be but justice to say, that no one of our countrymen ever did so much towards form∣ing a general natural history of this kingdom as Sir <HI>Robert Sibbald:</HI> he sketched out a fine out∣line of the Zoology of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which compre∣hends the greatest part of the <HI>English</HI> animals, and, we are told, had actually filled up a considerable part of it: he published a particular history of the county of <HI>Fife,</HI> and has left us a most excellent history of the whales which frequent the coast of <HI>Scotland.</HI> We acknowledge ourselves much indebted to him for information in respect to many of those
<PB N="56" REF="72"/>fish, few of which frequent the southern seas of those kingdoms, and those that are accidentally cast ashore on our coasts, are generally cut up by the country people, before an opportunity can be had of examining them.</P>

<HEAD>Div. II. CARTILAGINOUS FISH.</HEAD>
<P>THIS title is given to all fish whose muscles are supported by cartilages instead of bones, and comprehends the same genera of fish to which <HI>Linnaeus</HI> has given the name of <HI>amphibia nantes:</HI> but the word <HI>amphibia,</HI> ought properly to be confined to such animals who inhabit both elements, and can live without any inconvenience for a considerable space, either on land or under water. This defini∣tion therefore excludes all that form this division.</P>
<P>Many of the cartilaginous fish are viviparous, being excluded from an egg, which is hatched within them. The egg consists of a white and a yolk, and is lodged in a case, formed of a thick tough sub∣stance, not unlike softened horn: such are the eggs of the Ray and Shark kinds.</P>
<P>Some again differ in this respect, and are ovipa∣rous; such is the Sturgeon, and others.</P>
<P>They breathe either thro' certain apertures be∣neath, as in the Rays; on their sides as in the Sharks, &amp;c. or on the top of the head, as in the Pipe-fish; for they have not covers to their gills like the bony fish.</P>

<P>LAMPREYS are found at certain seasons of the year in several of our rivers, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Place.</NOTE> but the <HI>Severn</HI> is the most noted for them <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They are also found in the most considerable of the <HI>Scotch</HI> and <HI>Irish</HI> rivers.</NOTE> They are sea fish, but like salmon, quit the salt waters, and ascend the latter end of the winter, or beginning of spring, and after a stay of a few months return again to the ocean, a very few excepted. The best season for them is the months of <HI>March, April,</HI> and <HI>May;</HI> for they are more firm when just arrived out of the salt water than they are afterwards, being observed to be much wasted, and very flabby at the approach of hot weather.</P>
<P>They are taken in the nets along with salmon and shad, and sometimes in weels laid in the bottom of the river.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="75"/>It has been an old custom for the city of <HI>Glou∣cester,</HI> annually, to present his majesty with a <HI>lam∣prey</HI> pye, covered with a large raised crust. As the gift is made at <HI>Christmas,</HI> it is with great difficulty the corporation can procure any fresh lampreys at that time, tho' they give guinea a-piece for them, so early in the season.</P>
<P>They are reckoned a great delicacy, either when potted or stewed, but are a surfeiting food, as one of our monarchs fatally experienced, <HI>Henry</HI> the First's death being occasioned by a too plentiful meal of these fish.</P>
<P>Lampreys are sometimes found so large as to weigh four or five pounds.</P>
<P>The mouth is round and placed rather obliquely below the end of the nose: the edges are jagged, which enables them to adhere the more strongly to the stones, as their custom is, and which they do so firmly as not to be drawn off without some diffi∣culty.</P>
<P>We have heard of one weighing three pounds, which was taken out of the <HI>Esk,</HI> adhering to a stone of twelve pounds weight, suspended at its mouth, from which it was forced with no small pains.</P>
<P>There are in the mouth twenty rows of small teeth, disposed in circular orders, and placed far within.</P>
<P>The color is dusky, irregularly marked with dirty yellow, which gives the fish a disagreeable look.</P>
<P>We believe that the antients were unacquainted with this fish; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Not the Muraena</NOTE> so far is certain, that which Doctor <HI>Arbuthnot,</HI> and other learned men, render the word <HI>lamprey,</HI> is a species unknown in our seas, being the

<P>The words <HI>Lampetra</HI> and <HI>Petromyzon,</HI> are but of modern date, invented from the nature of the fish; the first a <HI>Lambendo petras,</HI> the other from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, because they are supposed to lick, or suck the rocks.</P>

<P>The nose, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Descr.</NOTE> tho' not long, is sharp pointed; above the eyes is a set of short spines: the whole upper part of that we examined was of a pale brown.

<P><PB N="63" REF="79"/>The tail is of a moderate length: near the end are two fins: along the top of it is one row of spines, and on the edges are irregularly dispersed a few others, which makes us imagine with Mr. <HI>Ray,</HI> that in this respect these fish vary, some having one, others more orders of spines on the tail.</P>

<P>The nose was very long, narrow, and sharp-point∣ed, not unlike the end of a spontoon.</P>
<P>The body was smooth, and very thin in pro∣portion to the size; the upper part ash-colored, spotted with numerous white spots, and a few black ones.</P>
<P>The tail was thick; towards the end were two small fins, on each side was a row of small spines, with another row in the middle, which run some way up the back.</P>
<P>The lower part of the fish was quite white.</P>
<P>The mouth very large, and furnished with num∣bers of small sharp teeth bending inwards.</P>
<P>On its body we found the <HI>hirudo muricata,</HI> which adhered very strongly, and when taken off left a black impression.</P>

<P>This wonderful faculty is occasioned by a most rapid, frequent, and violent contraction and exertion of its muscles, against any object that touches it.

<P>THIS common fish is easily distinguished from the others by the rows of strong sharp spines, disposed along the back and tail. In a large one we saw, were three rows on the back, and five on the tail, all inclining towards its end.</P>
<P>On the nose, and on the inner side of the fore∣head near the eyes, were a few spines, and others
<PB N="70" REF="86"/>were scattered without any order on the upper part of the pectoral fins.</P>
<P>The mouth was small, and filled with granulated teeth.</P>
<P>The upper part of the body was of a pale ash∣color, marked with short streaks of black, and the skin rough, with small tubercles like shagreen.</P>
<P>The belly white, crossed with a strong semilunar cartilage beneath the skin: in general the lower part was smooth, having only a few spines on each side.</P>
<P>The young fish have very few spines on them, and their backs are often spotted with white, and each spot is encircled with black.</P>
<P>This species frequents our sandy shores, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Food.</NOTE> are very voracious, and feed on all sorts of flat fish, and are particularly fond of herrings and sand eels, and sometimes eat crustaceous animals such as crabs.</P>

<P>THE weapon with which nature hath armed this fish, hath supplied the antients with many tremendous fables relating to it. <HI>Pliny, Aelian,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hist. an. lib.</HI> ii. <HI>c.</HI> 36.</NOTE> and <HI>Oppian,</HI> have given it a venom that affects even the inanimate creation: trees that are struck by it instantly lose their verdure and perish, and rocks themselves are incapable of resisting the potent poison.</P>
<P>The enchantress <HI>Circe,</HI> armed her son with a spear headed with the spine of the <HI>Trygon,</HI> as the most ir∣resistible weapon she could furnish him with, and with which he afterwards committed parricide, unin∣tentionally, on his father <HI>Ulysses.</HI></P>
<P>That spears and darts might, in very early times, have been headed with this bone instead of iron, we have no kind of doubt: that of another species of this fish being still used to point the arrows of some of the <HI>South American Indians,</HI> and is, from its hard∣ness, sharpness, and beards, a most dreadful weapon.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="88"/>But in respect to its venemous qualities there is not the lest credit to be given to the opinion, tho' it was believed (as far as it affected the animal world) by <HI>Rondeletius, Aldrovand,</HI> and others, and even to this day by the fishermen in several parts of the kingdom. It is in fact the weapon of of∣fence belonging to the fish, capable of giving a very bad wound, and which is attended with dangerous symptoms, when it falls on a tendinous part, or on a person in a bad habit of body. As to any fish having a spine charged with actual poison, we must deny our assent to it, tho' the report is sanctified by the name of <HI>Linnoeus</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Syst. Nat.</HI> I. 348.

The second, from the vehemence of its shock: and the third, by im∣parting a pungent pain like the sting of nettles, occasioned by the minute spines on its abdoment.</NOTE></P>

<P>THIS is the fish which connects the genus of rays and sharks, partaking something of the character of both; yet in an exception to each in the situation of the mouth, which is placed at the extremity of the head.</P>
<P>It is a fish not unfrequent on most of our coasts, where it prowls about for prey like others of the kind. It is extremely voracious, and, like the ray,
<PB N="75" REF="91"/>feeds on flounders and flat fish, which keep at the bot∣tom of the water, as we have often found on open∣ing them. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fierce∣ness.</NOTE> It is extremely fierce and dangerous to be approached. We knew an instance of a fisher∣man, whose leg was terribly tore by a large one of this species, which lay within his nets in shallow wa∣ter, and which he went to lay hold of incautiously.</P>
<P>The aspect of these, as well as the rest of the ge∣nus, have much malignity in them: their eyes are oblong, and placed lengthways in their head, funk in it, and overhung by the skin, and seem fuller of malevolence than fire.</P>
<P>Their skin is very rough; the antients made use of it to polish wood and ivory <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Qua lignum et ebora poliuntur. <HI>Plinii lib.</HI> ix. <HI>c.</HI> 12.</NOTE>, as we do at present that of the greater dog-fish. The flesh is now but little esteemed on account of its coarseness and rankness, yet <HI>Archestratus</HI> (as quoted by <HI>Athenaeus,</HI> p. 319) speaking of the fish of <HI>Miletus,</HI> gives this the first place in respect to its delicacy of the whole cartilaginous tribe.</P>
<P>They grow to a great size; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Descr.</NOTE> we have seen them of near an hundred weight.</P>
<P>The head is large, the teeth broad at their base, but slender and very sharp above, and disposed in five rows all round the jaws. Like those of all sharks, they are capable of being raised or depressed by means of muscles uniting them to the jaws, not being lodged in sockets as the teeth of cetaceous fish are.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="92"/>The tongue is large; the eyes small; the pupil of a pale green; the irides white, spotted with brown: behind each eye is a semilunar orifice.</P>
<P>The back is of a pale ash-color, and very rough; along the middle is a prickly tuberculated line: the belly is white and smooth.</P>
<P>The pectoral fins are very large, and extend hori∣zontally from the body to a great distance; they have some resemblance to wings, so writers have given this the name it bears in this work.</P>
<P>The ventral fins are placed in the same manner, and the double penis is placed in them, which forms another character of the males in this and the last genus.</P>
<P>The tail is bifurcated, the upper lobe rather the longest: not very remote from the end on the back are two fins.</P>

</LIST>
<P>THIS species has been long known to the inha∣bitants of the south and west of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and those of <HI>Caernarvonshire</HI> and <HI>Anglesea;</HI> but having never been considered in any other than a commer∣cial view, has till this time remained undescribed, at lest by any <HI>English</HI> writer <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Linnaeus, p.</HI> 400. mentions a species, which in size, and in some other respects, resembles this; but his differs in having a small anal fin. It is his <HI>Squalus maximus. S. dentibus caninis, pinna dorsali anteriore majore.</HI> He says it inhabites the <HI>arctic</HI> seas, and feeds on <HI>medusae</HI> (sea jellies) that it rivals the whale in size, has no orifice near the eyes, and has a small anal fin.</NOTE>; and what is worse, mis∣taken for and confounded with the <HI>luna</HI> of <HI>Rondele∣tius,</HI> the same that our <HI>English</HI> writers call the <HI>sun∣fish.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Irish</HI> and <HI>Welch</HI> give it the same name, from its lying as if to sun itself on the surface of the wa∣ter; and for the same reason we have taken the li∣berty of calling it the basking shark. It was long taken for a species of whale, till we pointed out the branchial orifices on the sides, and the perpendicular site of the tail.</P>
<P>These are migratory fish, or at lest it is but in a certain number of years that they are seen in mul∣titudes on the <HI>Welch</HI> seas, tho' in most summers a single and perhaps strayed fish appears.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="95"/>They visited the bays of <HI>Caernarvonshire</HI> and <HI>An∣glesea</HI> in vast shoals, in the summers of 1756 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some old people say they recollect the same sort of fish visiting these seas in vast numbers about forty years ago.</NOTE>, and a few succeeding years, continuing there only the hot months, for they quitted the coast about <HI>Michael∣mas,</HI> as if cold weather was disagreeable to them.</P>
<P>They had nothing of the fierce and voracious na∣ture of the shark kind, and were so tame as to suf∣fer themselves to be stroked: they generally lay mo∣tionless on the surface, commonly on their bellies, but sometimes, like tired swimmers, on their backs.</P>
<P>Their food seemed to consist entirely of sea plants, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Food.</NOTE> no remains of fish being ever discovered in the sto∣machs of numbers that were cut up, except some green stuff, the half digested parts of algae, and the like.</P>
<P>At certain times they were seen sporting on the waves, and leaping with vast agility several feet out of the water.</P>
<P>Their length was from three to eleven yards, but the last was a rare size.</P>
<P>Their form was rather slender, like others of the shark kind.</P>
<P>The upper jaw was much longer than the lower, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Teeth.</NOTE> and blunt at the end. The mouth placed beneath, and each jaw furnished with numbers of small teeth: those before were much bent, those more remote in the jaws, were conic and sharp pointed.</P>
<P>On the sides of the neck were five large trans∣verse apertures to the gills.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="96"/>On the back were two fins; the first very large, not directly in the middle of the back, but rather nearer the head; the other small, and situated near the tail. On the lower part were four others, viz. two pectoral fins, and two ventral fins; the last placed just beneath the hind fin of the back. Near these the male had two genitals, and between these fins was situated the pudendum of the female.</P>
<P>The tail was very large, and the upper part re∣markably longer than the lower.</P>
<P>The color of the upper part of the body was a deep leaden; the belly white.</P>
<P>The skin was rough, like shagreen, but less so on the belly than the back.</P>
<P>Within side the mouth, towards the throat, was a very short sort of whalebone.</P>
<P>The liver was of a great size, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Liver.</NOTE> but that of the female was the largest; some weighed above a thou∣sand pounds, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Oil.</NOTE> and yielded a great quantity of pure and sweet oil, fit for lamps, and also much used by the people who took them, to cure bruises, burns, and rheumatic complaints. A large fish has afforded to the captors a profit of twenty pounds. They were viviparous, a young one about a foot in length being found in the belly of a fish of this kind.</P>
<P>They were taken with harpoons with long lines fixed to them in much the same manner as whales are, and when struck go off with vast rapidity, and dart instantly to the bottom, taking with them forty or fifty fathom of line, and are a long time before they are quite subdued.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="97"/>The fishers observed on them a sort of leech of a reddish color, and about two feet long, but which fell off when the fish was brought to the surface of the water, and left a white mark on the skin.</P>
<P>The same persons assert, that there were two spe∣cies of this fish; a lesser sort, about two yards in length, which had in the mouth only three rows of teeth, and those larger than in the kind we have described, being an inch and an half long.</P>
<P>This account we digested from materials furnished by the Rev. Mr. <HI>Farrington,</HI> and the Rev. Mr. <HI>Wil∣liams,</HI> Rector of <HI>Lanvair yn Hornwy,</HI> in <HI>Anglesea;</HI> for it has not been our fortune to see more of this fish than fragments of the skin, jaws, and what is styled whalebone: they have now in a manner quit∣ted the coasts, scarce one in a summer appearing in those seas.</P>

<P>THIS grows to a very great bulk, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Size.</NOTE> <HI>Gillius</HI> says, to the weight of four thousand pounds; and that in the belly of one was found a human corps entire, which is far from incredible, considering their vast greediness after human flesh.</P>
<P>They are the dread of the sailors in all hot cli∣mates, where they constantly attend the ships in ex∣pectation of what may drop overboard; a man that has that misfortune perishes without redemption: they have been seen to dart at him, like gudgeons to a worm. A master of a <HI>Guinea</HI> ship informed me, that a rage of suicide prevailed among his new bought slaves, from a notion the unhappy creatures had, that after death they should be restored again to their families, friends, and country. To convince them at lest that they should not re-animate their bodies, he ordered one of their corpses to be tied by
<PB N="83" REF="99"/>the heels to a rope, and lowered into the sea, and tho' it was drawn up again as fast as the united force of the crew could be exerted, yet in that short space the sharks had devoured every part but the feet, which were secured at the end of the cord.</P>
<P>Swimmers very often perish by them; sometimes they lose an arm or leg, and sometimes are bit quite assunder, serving but for two morsels for this rave∣nous animal: a melancholy tale of this kind is re∣lated in a <HI>West India</HI> ballad, preserved in Mr. <HI>Percy</HI>'s reliques of ancient <HI>English</HI> poetry <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> I. 331.</NOTE></P>
<P>The mouth of this fish is furnished with (some∣times) a sixfold row of teeth, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Teeth.</NOTE> flat, triangular, ex∣ceedingly sharp at their edges, and finely serrated. We have one that is rather more than an inch and an half long. <HI>Grew</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rarities.</HI> 91.</NOTE> says, that those in the jaws of a shark two yards in length, are not half an inch, so that the fish to which mine belonged must have been six yards long, provided the teeth and body keep pace in their growth <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Fossil teeth of this fish are very frequent in <HI>Malta,</HI> some of which are four inches long.</NOTE></P>
<P>This dreadful apparatus, when the fish is in a state of repose, lie quite flat in the mouth, but when he seizes his prey, he has power of erecting them, by the help of a set of muscles that join them to the jaw.</P>
<P>The mouth is placed far beneath, for which rea∣son these, as well as the rest of the kind, are said to
<PB N="84" REF="100"/>be obliged to turn on their backs to seize their prey, which is an observation as antient as the days of <HI>Pliny</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Omnia qutem carnivora sunt talia et supina vescantur. lib. <HI>ix.</HI> c. <HI>24.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>The eyes are large; the back broad, flat, and shorter than that of other sharks. The tail is of a semilunar form, but the upper part is longer than the lower. It has vast strength in the tail, and can strike with great force, so that the sailors instantly cut it off with an axe as soon as they draw one on board.</P>
<P>The pectoral fins are very large, which enables it to swim with great swiftness.</P>
<P>The color of the whole body and fins is a light ash.</P>
<P>The antients were acquainted with this fish; and <HI>Oppian</HI> gives a long and entertaining account of its capture. Their flesh is sometimes eaten, but is es∣teemed both coarse and rank.</P>

<P><HI>AELIAN</HI> relates strange things of the affection this species bears to its young: among others, he says, that it will permit the small brood, when in danger, to swim down its mouth, and take shel∣ter
<PB N="85" REF="101"/>in its belly. This fact has been since confirmed by the observation of one of our best icthyologists <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rondeletius, <HI>388.</HI></NOTE>, and is no more incredible, than that the young of the <HI>Opossum</HI> should seek an asylum in the ventral pouch of its parent, a fact too well known to be contested. But this degree of care is not peculiar to the blue shark, but we believe common to the whole genus.</P>
<P>This species frequents many of our coasts, but particularly those of <HI>Cornwall</HI> during the pilchard season, and is at that time taken with great iron hooks made on purpose.</P>
<P>It is of an oblong form: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Descr.</NOTE> the nose extends far beyond the mouth: it wants the orifices behind the eyes, which are usual in this genus: the nostrils are long, and placed transversely. <HI>Artedi</HI> remarks a triangular dent in the lower part of the back.</P>
<P>The skin is smoother than that of other sharks; the back is of a fine blue color; the belly of a sil∣very white.</P>
<P><HI>Linnoeus</HI> says, that its teeth are granulated; for our part we must confess it is a fish that has not come under our examination, therefore hope to be fa∣vored with an accurate description from some Natu∣list, who lives on the coast it haunts.</P>
<P>We may add, that <HI>Rondeletius</HI> says he was an eye∣witness to its fondness for human flesh; that these fish are less destructive in our seas, is owing to the coolness of the climate, which is well known to abate the fierceness of some, as well as the venom of other animals.</P>

<P>The fishing frog grows to a large size, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Descr.</NOTE> some be∣ing between four and five feet in length; and we have heard of one taken near <HI>Scarborough,</HI> whose mouth was a yard wide. The fishermen on that coast have a great regard for this fish, from a sup∣position that it is a great enemy to the dog fish <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">The bodies of these fierce and voracious fish are often found in the stomach of the <HI>Fishing Frog.</HI></NOTE>, and whenever they take it with their lines, always set it at liberty.</P>
<P>It is a fish of very great deformity: the head is much bigger than the whole body, is round at the circumference, and flat above: the mouth of a pro∣digious wideness.</P>
<P>The under jaw is much longer than the upper: the jaws are full of slender sharp teeth: in the roof of the mouth are two or three rows of the same: at the root of the tongue, opposite each other, are two bones of an elliptical form, thick set, with very strong sharp teeth.</P>
<P>The nostrils do not appear externally, but in the upper part of the mouth are two large orifices that serve instead of them.</P>
<P>On each side the upper jaw are two sharp spines, and others are scattered about the upper part of the head.</P>

<P>THAT this is the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> of <HI>Dorion,</HI> as quoted by <HI>Athenaeus,</HI> is very probable, as well from the account he gives of its form, as of its nature. He says its mouth is always open, with which it agrees with the sturgeon, and that it conceals itself in the hot months: this shews it to be a fish of a cold nature, which is confirmed by the history of
<PB N="97" REF="115"/>the <HI>European</HI> fish of this species, given by Mr. <HI>Forster</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phil. Trans. <HI>lvii. 352.</HI></NOTE>, in his Essay on the <HI>Volga,</HI> who relates that they are scarce ever found in that river in spring or summer, but in vast quantities in autumn and win∣ter, when they crowd from the sea under the ice, and are then taken in great numbers.</P>
<P>Whether the <HI>acipenser</HI> is the sturgeon of the mo∣derns, may be doubted, otherwise <HI>Ovid</HI> would ne∣ver have spoke of it as a foreign fish:
<Q><L><HI>Tuque peregrinis, Acipenser, nobilis undis.</HI></L>
<L>And, thou, a fish in foreign seas renowned.</L></Q></P>
<P>It being well known that it is not uncommon in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> and even in the mouth of the <HI>Tiber,</HI> at certain seasons; but this passage leaves us as much in the dark as to the particular species in∣tended, by the word <HI>acipenser,</HI> as the description <HI>Pliny</HI> has given us; for that philosopher relates, that its scales are placed in a contrary direction to those of other fish, being turned towards the mouth, which disagrees with the character of all that are known at present. Whatever fish it might be, it was cer∣tainly the same with the <HI>Elops,</HI> or <HI>Helops,</HI> as appears both from <HI>Pliny,</HI> and another line of the poet be∣fore-mentioned:
<Q><HI>Et pretiosus Helops nostris incognitus undis.</HI></Q>
<Q>The pretious <HI>Helops</HI> stranger to our seas.</Q></P>
<P>The sturgeon annually ascends our rivers, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Migra∣tory.</NOTE> but in no great numbers, and is taken by accident in the
<PB N="98" REF="116"/>salmon nets. It seems a spiritless fish, making no manner of resistance when entangled, but is drawn out of the water like a lifeless lump. It is a fish that is seldom taken far out at sea, but frequents such parts as are not remote from the aestuaries of great rivers. It is admired for the delicacy and firmness of its flesh, which is white as veal, and extremely good when roasted. It is generally pickled. The most we receive comes either from the <HI>Baltic</HI> rivers, or <HI>North America:</HI> those cured at <HI>Pillau</HI> have been, till of late, in the greatest repute; but thro' the encou∣ragement given by the society instituted for pro∣moting trade and manufactures, the sturgeon from our colonies begins to rival those of the <HI>Baltic.</HI></P>
<P>Great numbers are taken during summer in the lakes <HI>Frische-haff,</HI> and <HI>Curisch-haff</HI> near <HI>Pillau,</HI> in large nets made of small cord. The adjacent shores are formed into districts, and farmed out to compa∣nies of fishermen, some of which are rented for six thousand guilders, or near three hundred pounds <HI>per annum.</HI></P>
<P>They are found in vast abundance in the <HI>American</HI> rivers in <HI>May, June,</HI> and <HI>July,</HI> at which time they leap some yards out of the water, and falling on their sides, make a noise to be heard in still weather at some miles distance <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Catesby Carol.

The <HI>Mario,</HI> said by <HI>Pliny lib.</HI> ix. <HI>c.</HI> 15. to be found in the <HI>Danube</HI> and the <HI>Borysthenes,</HI> was certainly of this genus, a cartilaginous fish <HI>(nullis ossibus spinisve intersitis)</HI> resem∣bling a small porpesse <HI>(Porculo marino simillimus;)</HI> and very pro∣bably may be the same with the <HI>Beluga,</HI> which, according to Mr. <HI>Forster, Phil. Trans.</HI> lvii. 354. has a short blunt nose, agree∣ing in that respect with the porpesse.</NOTE></P>
<P>The sturgeon grows to a great size, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Descr.</NOTE> to the length of eighteen feet, and to the weight of five hundred pounds, but it is seldom taken in our rivers of that bulk. The largest we have known caught in those of <HI>Great Britain</HI> weighed four hundred and sixty pounds, which was taken about two years ago in the <HI>Esk,</HI> where they are more frequently found than in our southern waters.</P>
<P>The nose is very long, slender, and ends in a point. The eyes are extremely small; the nostrils placed near them: on the lower part of the nose are four cirri or beards: the mouth is situated far be∣neath, is small, and unsupported by any jaw bones; neither has it any teeth.</P>
<P>The body is long, pentagonal, and covered with five rows of large bony tubercles: one row of which is placed on the back, and two on each side. The whole under side of the fish, from the end of
<PB N="100" REF="118"/>the nose to the vent, is flat; on the back, not re∣mote from the tail, is a single fin. It has besides two pectoral fins, two ventral and one anal fin. The tail is bifurcated, but the upper part much longer than the lower.</P>
<P>The upper part of the body is of a dirty olive color: the lower part silvery; the middle of the tubercles white.</P>
<P>In the manner of breeding it is an exception among the cartilaginous fish, being like the bony fish oviparous, spawning in winter.</P>

<P><PB N="104" REF="122"/>On the lower part of the back is a thick knob, improperly called a fin, being destitute of spines; beneath that is the dorsal fin, of a brownish hue, reaching within an inch of the tail: on the belly, just opposite, is another of the same form. The belly is of a bright crimson color: the pectoral fins are large and broad, almost uniting at their base. Beneath these is the part by which it adheres to the rocks, &amp;c. It consists of an oval aperture, sur∣rounded with a fleshy muscular and obtuse soft sub∣stance, edged with small threaded appendages, which concur as so many claspers: tail and vent fins purple.</P>
<P>By means of this part it adheres with vast force to any thing it pleases. As a proof of its tenacity we have known, that on flinging a fish of this spe∣cies just caught, into a pail of water, it fixed itself so firmly to the bottom, that on taking the fish by the tail, the whole pail by that means was lifted, tho' it held some gallons, and that without removing the fish from its hold.</P>
<P>Great numbers of these fish are found in the <HI>Greenland</HI> seas during the months of <HI>April</HI> and <HI>May,</HI> when they resort near the shore to spawn. Their roc is remarkably large, which the <HI>Greenlanders</HI> boil to a pulp, and eat. They are extremely fat, which recommends them the more to the natives, who ad∣mire all oily food: they call them <HI>Nipisets,</HI> or <HI>Cat∣fish,</HI> and take quantities of them during the season <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Crantz's Hist. Greenland, <HI>I. 96.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>This fish is sometimes eaten in <HI>England,</HI> being stewed like carp, but is both flabby and insipid.</P>

<P>THE sea snail takes its name from the soft and unctuous texture of its body, resembling that of the land snail. It is almost transparent, and soon dissolves and melts away.</P>
<P>It is found in the sea near the mouths of great rivers.</P>
<P>The length is five inches: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Descr.</NOTE> the color when fresh taken a pale brown: the shape of the body round, but near the tail compressed sideways: the belly is white, and very protuberant.</P>
<P>The head is large, thick, and round. There are no teeth in the mouth, but the jaws are very rough: the tongue very large.</P>
<P>The orifice to the gills is very small.</P>
<P>The pectoral fins are very broad, thin, and trans∣parent, and almost unite under the throat. The first ray next the throat is very long, extends far beyond the rest, and is as fine as a hair. Over the base of each is a sort of operculum, or lid, ending in a point: this is capable of being raised or de∣pressed at pleasure.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="124"/>Behind the head begins the dorsal fin, which ex∣tends quite to the end of the tail: the ventral fin begins at the anus, and unites with the other at the tail.</P>
<P>Beneath the throat is a round depression of a whitish color, like the impression of a seal, surrounded by twelve small pale yellow tubera, by which it is probable it adheres to the stones like the other species.</P>

<P><PB N="107" REF="126"/>The irides were red; behind each eye was a deep brown line.</P>
<P>The body, in the thickest part, was about equal to a swan's quil, and angular; but the angles not being very sharp, they were not easily seen till the fish was dried: the belly was slightly carinated, and marked along the middle with a dusky line.</P>
<P>The general color of the fish was an olive brown: the sides marked with numbers of bluish lines point∣ing from the back to the belly, which, in dried fish, seemed like the signs of so many joints. Those in a fresh subject ceased beyond the vent; all beyond that was spotted with brown.</P>
<P>The dorsal fin was narrow and thin, consisting of thirty-eight rays, was two inches long, and placed rather nearer to the head than the tail.</P>
<P>The vent was seven inches from the tip of the nose, the body to that orifice was of an equal thickness, but from thence tapered to a very small point, having no mark of a fin.</P>
<P>The pectoral fins were also wanting; in short, all except the back fin.</P>
<P>When this fish and the next species are dried, they appear covered with numbers of angular crusts, finely radiated from their centre.</P>
<P>They are viviparous; for on crushing one that was just taken, hundreds of very minute ones were ob∣served to crawl about.</P>

<P>THE eel is a very singular fish in several things that relate to its natural history, and in some respects borders on the nature of the reptile tribe.</P>
<P>It is known to quit its element, and during night to wander along the meadows, not only for
<PB N="112" REF="131"/>change of habitation, but also that the sake of prey, feeding on the snails it finds in its passage.</P>
<P>During winter it beds itself deep in the mud, and continues in a state of rest like the serpent kind. It is very impatient of cold, and will eagerly take shelter in a whisp of straw flung into a pond in se∣vere weather, which has sometimes been practised as a method of taking them. <HI>Albertus</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gesner pisc. <HI>45.</HI></NOTE> goes so far as to say, that he has known eels to take shelter in a hay-rick, yet all perished thro' excess of cold.</P>
<P>It has been observed, that in the river <HI>Nyne</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot"><HI>Morton</HI>'s <HI>Hist. Northampt.</HI> 419. <HI>Pliny</HI> observes, that the eels of the lake <HI>Benacus</HI> collect together in the same manner in the month of <HI>October,</HI> possibly to retreat from the winter's cold. <HI>lib.</HI> ix. <HI>c.</HI> 22.</NOTE> there is a variety of small eel, with a lesser head and narrower mouth than the mommon kind, that is found in clus;ters in the bottom of the river, and is called the <HI>Bed-eel:</HI> these are sometimes rouzed up by violent floods, and are never found at that time with meat in their stomachs. This bears such an analogy with the clustering of blindworms in their quiescent state, that we cannot but consider it as a further proof of a partial agreement in the nature of the two genera.</P>
<P>The antients adopted a most wild opinion about the generation of these fish, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Genera∣tion.</NOTE> believing them to be either created from the mud, or that the scrapings of their bodies which they left on the stones, were animated and became young eels. Some moderns gave into these opinions, and into others that were equally extravagant. They could not account for
<PB N="113" REF="132"/>the appearance of these fish in ponds that never were stocked with them, and that were even so remote as to make their being met with in such places a phae∣nomenon that they could not solve. But there is much reason to believe, that many waters are sup∣plied with these fish by the aquatic fowl of prey, in the same manner as vegetation is spread by many of the land birds, either by being dropped as they carry them to feed their young, or by passing quick thro' their bodies, as is the case with herons; and such may be occasion of the appearance of these fish in places where they were never seen before. As to their immediate generation, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Vivipa∣rous.</NOTE> it has been sufficiently proved to be effected in the ordinary course of na∣ture, and that they are viviparous.</P>
<P>They are extremely voracious, and very destruc∣tive to the fry of fish.</P>
<P>No fish lives so long out of water as the eel: it is extremely tenacious of life, as its parts will move a considerable time after they are flayed and cut into pieces.</P>
<P>The eel is placed by <HI>Linnaeus</HI> in the genus of <HI>Mu∣raena,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Descr.</NOTE> his first of the apodal fish, or such which want the ventral fins.</P>
<P>The eyes are placed not remote from the end of the nose: the irides are tinged with red: the under jaw is longer than the upper: the teeth are small, sharp, and numerous: beneath each eye is a minute orifice: at the end of the nose two others, small and tubular.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="133"/>This fish is furnished with a pair of pectoral fins, rounded at their ends. Another narrow fin on the back, uniting with that of the tail; and the anal fin joins it in the same manner beneath.</P>
<P>Behind the pectoral fins is the orifice to the gills, which are concealed in the skin.</P>
<P>Eels vary much in their colors, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Silver Eels.</NOTE> from a sooty hue to a light olive green; and those which are called silver eels, have their bellies white, and a remarka∣ble clearness throughout.</P>
<P>Besides these there is another variety of this fish known in the <HI>Thames</HI> by the name of <HI>Grigs,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Grigs.</NOTE> and about <HI>Oxford</HI> by that of <HI>Grigs</HI> or <HI>Gluts.</HI> These are scarce ever seen near <HI>Oxford</HI> in the winter, but ap∣pear in spring, and bite readily at the hook, which common eels in that neighborhood will not. They have a larger head, a blunter nose, thicker skin, and Jess fat than the common sort; neither are they so much esteemed, nor do they often exceed three or four pounds in weight.</P>
<P>Common eels grow to a large size, sometimes so great as to weigh fifteen or twenty pounds, but that is extremely rare. As to instances brought by <HI>Dale</HI> and others, of these fish encreasing to a superior magnitude, we have much reason to suspect them to have been congers, since the enormous fish they describe, have all been taken at the mouths of the <HI>Thames</HI> or <HI>Medway.</HI></P>
<P>The eel is the most universal of fish, yet is scarce ever found in the <HI>Danube,</HI> tho' it is very common in the lakes and rivers of <HI>Upper Austria.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="134"/>The <HI>Romans</HI> held this fish very cheap, probably from its likeness to a snake:

<L>Vernula riparum pinguis torrente cloaca.</L></Q>
<Q>For you, is kept a sink-fed snake-like eel.</Q></P>
<P>On the contrary, the luxurious <HI>Sybarites</HI> were so fond of these fish, as to exempt from every kind of tribute the persons who sold them <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Athenaeus. lib. <HI>xii.</HI> p. <HI>521.</HI></NOTE></P>

<ITEM>7. They have more bones than the common eel, especially along the back quite to the head.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. They grow to a much larger size.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>As to the distinction that Mr. <HI>Ray,</HI> and other writers, make of the small beards at the end of the nose, we think it not to be depended on, being sometimes found in both kinds, and sometimes en∣tirely wanting.</P>
<P>We believe they generate like the fresh-water species: innumerable quantities, of what are sup∣posed to be their fry, come up the <HI>Severn</HI> about the month of <HI>April,</HI> preceding the <HI>Shads,</HI> which it is conjectured migrate into that river to feed on them: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Elvers.</NOTE> they are called <HI>Elvers.</HI> They quite swarm during their season, and are taken in a kind of sieve made of hair-cloth, fixed to a long pole; the fish∣erman standing on the edge of the water during the tide, puts in his net as far as he can reach, and draw∣ing it out again takes multitudes at every sweep, and will take as many during one tide as will fill a bushel. They are dressed, and reckoned very deli∣cate.</P>
<P>Congers are extremely voracious, preying on other fish, and on crabs at the time they have lost their shell, and are in a soft state. They and eels in ge∣neral are also particularly fond of carcasses of any

<P>These fish are an article of commerce in <HI>Corn∣wall;</HI> numbers are taken on that coast, and exported to <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portugal,</HI> particularly to <HI>Barcelona.</HI> The quantities that were sent from <HI>Mount's-Bay</HI> for five years, are as follow:

<P>Some are taken by a single hook and line, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Capture.</NOTE> but (because that way is tedious, and does not answer the expence of time and labor) they are chiefly caught by <HI>Bulters,</HI> which are strong lines five hundred feet long, with sixty hooks, each eight feet asunder, baited with pilchards or mackrel: the <HI>Bulters</HI> are sunk to the ground by a stone fastened to them: sometimes such a number of these are tied together as to reach a mile.</P>
<P>We have been told that the fishermen are very fearful of a large conger, least it should endanger their legs by clinging round them; they therefore kill them as soon as possible by striking them on the navel.</P>
<P>They are afterwards cured in this manner: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE> they are slit, and hung on a frame till they dry, having a considerable quantity of fat, which it is necessary
<PB N="118" REF="137"/>should exude before they are fit for use. It is re∣markable that a conger of a hundred weight will waste by drying to twenty-four pounds; the people therefore prefer the smallest, possibly because they are soonest cured. During the process there is a considerable stench; and it is said that in the fishing villages the poultry are fed with the maggots that drop from the fish.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portuguese</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> use those dried congers after they have been ground into a powder, to thicken and give a relish to their soups. We think they are sold for about forty shillings the quintal, which weighs one hundred and twenty-six pounds.</P>

Schonevelde,</HI> 45.</NOTE> and <HI>Norway,</HI> on the coasts of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and of <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> and lastly, in that part of the <HI>German</HI> ocean, which washes the shores of <HI>Holland,</HI> the most southern of its haunts we can with any certainty mention.</P>
<P>It is a most ravenous and fierce fish, and when taken fastens on any thing within its reach: the fishermen dreading its bite, endeavor as soon as possi∣ble
<PB N="120" REF="140"/>to beat out its fore teeth, and then kill it by striking it behind the head. <HI>Schonevelde</HI> relates, that its bite is so hard that it will seize on an anchor, and leave the marks of its teeth in it; and the <HI>Danish</HI> and <HI>German</HI> names of <HI>Steenbider</HI> and <HI>Steinbeisser,</HI> ex∣press the sense of its great strength, as if it was ca∣pable of crushing even stones with its jaws.</P>
<P>It feeds almost entirely on crustaceous animals, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Food.</NOTE> and shell fish, such as crabs, lobsters, prawns, mus∣cles, scollops, large whelks, &amp;c. these it grinds to pieces with its teeth, and swallows with the lesser shells. It does not appear they are dissolved in the stomach, but are voided with the foeces, for which purpose the aperture of the anus is wider than in other fish of the same size.</P>
<P>It is full of roe in <HI>February, March,</HI> and <HI>April,</HI> and spawns in <HI>May</HI> and <HI>June.</HI></P>
<P>This fish has so disagreeable and horrid an ap∣pearance, that nobody at <HI>Scarborough</HI> except the fishermen will eat it, and they prefer it to holibut. They always before dressing take off the head and skin.</P>
<P>The sea wolf grows to a large size: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Size.</NOTE> those on the <HI>Yorkshire</HI> coast are sometimes found of the length of four feet, and, according to Doctor <HI>Gronovius,</HI> have been taken near <HI>Hitland</HI> seven feet long, and even more. That which we examined was three feet two inches and an half from the tip of the nose to the end of the tail: the length of the head was eight inches, from the gills to the vent, ten; from thence to the tip of the tail, twenty and one half.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="141"/>The circumference of the head was seventeen inches, at the shoulders twenty, but near the tail only four and a half.</P>
<P>Its weight was twenty pounds and a quarter.</P>
<P>The head is a little slatted on the top: the nose blunt; the nostrils very small; the eyes small, and placed near the end of the nose.</P>
<P>The teeth are very remarkable, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Teeth.</NOTE> and finely adapted to its way of life. The fore teeth are strong, coni∣cal, diverging a little from each other, stand far out of the jaws, and are commonly six above, and the same below, tho' sometimes there are only five in each jaw: these are supported within-side by a row of lesser teeth, which makes the number in the up∣per jaw seventeen or eighteen, in the lower eleven or twelve.</P>
<P>The sides of the under jaw are convex inwards, which greatly adds to their strength, and at the same time allows room for the large muscles with which the head of this fish is furnished.</P>
<P>The <HI>dentes molares,</HI> or grinding teeth of the under jaw, are higher on the outer than the inner edges, which inclines their surfaces inward: they join to the canine teeth in that jaw, but in the upper are se∣parate from them.</P>
<P>In the centre are two rows of flat strong teeth, fixed on an oblong basis upon the bones of the pa∣late and nose.</P>
<P>These and the other grinding teeth are often found fossil, and in that state called <HI>Bufonites,</HI> or <HI>Toad∣stones:</HI> they were formerly much esteemed for their
<PB N="122" REF="142"/>imaginary virtues, and were set in gold, and worn as rings.</P>
<P>The two bones that form the under jaw are united before by a loose cartilage, which mechanism admit∣ting of a motion from side to side, most evidently contributes to the design of the whole, <HI>viz.</HI> a faci∣lity of breaking, grinding, and comminuting its testaceous and crustaceous food.</P>
<P>The body is long, and a little compressed side∣ways; the skin smooth and slippery: it wants the la∣teral line.</P>
<P>The pectoral fins consist of eighteen rays, are five inches long, and seven and a quarter broad.</P>
<P>The dorsal fin extends from the hind part of the head almost to the tail; the rays in the fresh fish are not visible.</P>
<P>The anal fin extends as far as the dorsal fin.</P>
<P>The tail is round at its end, and consists of thir∣teen rays.</P>
<P>The sides, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Color.</NOTE> back, and fins, are of a livid lead co∣lor; the two first marked downwards wiith irregular obscure dusky lines; these in different fish have dif∣ferent appearances.</P>
<P>We think ourselves much indebted to Mr. <HI>Travis,</HI> Surgeon, at <HI>Scarborough,</HI> for his ingenious remarks on this fish, as well as on several others that frequent that coast, being a gentleman much skilled in icthy∣ology, and extremely liberal in communicating his knowlege.</P>

<P>THE launce is found on most of our sandy shores during some of the summer months: it conceals itself on the recess of the tides beneath the sand, in such places where the water is left at the depth of about a foot, and are in some places dug out, in others drawn up by means of a hook contrived for that purpose. They are commonly used for baits for other fish, but they are also very delicate eating.</P>
<P>These fish are found in the stomachs of the <HI>Por∣pesse,</HI> an argument that the last roots up the sand with its nose as hogs do the ground.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="146"/>They grow sometimes the length of nine or ten inches: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Size.</NOTE> the females are longer and slender than the males.</P>

<P>THIS fish sometimes frequents our coasts, but is much more common in the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> sea, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Place.</NOTE> especially in the part that separates <HI>Italy</HI> from <HI>Sicily,</HI> which has been long celebrated for it: the promontory <HI>Pelorus</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Athenaeus,</HI> 314.</NOTE>, now <HI>Capo di Faro,</HI> was a place noted for the resort of the <HI>Xiphias,</HI> being possibly the station of the <HI>speculatores,</HI> or the persons who watched and gave notice of the approach of the fish.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="149"/>The antient method of taking them is particu∣larly described by <HI>Strabo</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lib.</HI> I. <HI>p.</HI> 16.</NOTE>, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Capture.</NOTE> and agrees exactly with that practised by the moderns.</P>
<P>A man ascends one of the cliffs that overhangs the sea: as soon as he spies the fish, he gives notice either by his voice or by signs of the course it takes. Another, that is stationed in a boat, climbs up the mast, and on seeing the sword fish, directs the row∣ers towards it. As soon as he thinks they are got within reach, he descends, and taking a spear in his hand, strikes it into the fish, which, after wearying itself with its agitation, is seized and drawn into the boat. It is much esteemed by the <HI>Sicilians,</HI> who buy it up eagerly, and at its first coming into season give about six-pence <HI>English</HI> per pound. The season lasts from <HI>May</HI> till <HI>August</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ray</HI>'s <HI>Travels,</HI> I. 271.</NOTE>.

<P><HI>Kircher,</HI> in his <HI>Musurgia,</HI> has preserved a strange incantation used by the <HI>Sicilian</HI> fishermen, at the capture of the <HI>Pesce Spada,</HI> as they call it, which is expressed in the following unintelligible jargon:

<P>The snout is the upper jaw, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Snout.</NOTE> produced to a great length, and has some resemblance to a sword, from whence the name.

<P><HI>LINNAEUS</HI> has given this genus the name of <HI>Callionymus,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Name.</NOTE> fish mentioned by several of the antients; but the notices the have left of it are so very slight, as to render it difficult to determine what species they intended. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lib.</HI> xxxii. <HI>c.</HI> iii.</NOTE> <HI>Pliny</HI> makes it a synonym to the <HI>Uranoscopus,</HI> a fish frequent in the <HI>Italian</HI> seas, but very different from our <HI>Dragonet,</HI> a name we
<PB N="131" REF="153"/>have taken the liberty of forming, from the diminu∣tive <HI>Dracunculus,</HI> a title given it by <HI>Rondeletius,</HI> and other authors. The <HI>English</HI> writers have called it the Yellow Gurnard, which having no one character of the <HI>Gurnard</HI> genus, we think ourselves obliged to drop that name.</P>
<P>It is found as far north as <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Place.</NOTE> and as far south as the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> sea, and is not unfrequent on the <HI>Scarborough</HI> coasts. We have also received it from <HI>Norway,</HI> among several other curiosities which that honest well-meaning prelate, <HI>Erich Pontoppi∣dan</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bishop of <HI>Bergen.</HI> He was also vice-chancellor of the university of <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> in which station he died, <HI>December</HI> 20, 1764, aged 66, much respected by his countrymen.</NOTE>, made us a present of.</P>
<P>This species grows to the length of ten or twelve inches: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Descr.</NOTE> the body is slender, round, and smooth.</P>
<P>The head is large, and flat at the top; in the hind part are two orifices, thro' which it breathes, and also forces out the water it takes in at the mouth, in the same manner as the cetaceous fish.</P>
<P>The apertures to the gills are closed: on the end of the bones that cover them is a very singular tri∣furcated spine.</P>
<P>The eyes are large, and placed very near each other on the upper part of the head, so that they look upwards; for which reason it has been ranked among the <HI>Uranoscopi:</HI> the pupils are of a rich sap∣pharine blue, the irides of a fine yellow.</P>
<P>The upper jaw projects much farther than the lower: the mouth is very wide: the teeth are small.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="154"/>The pectoral fins are round, and of a light-brown color; the ventral placed before them, are very broad, and consist of five branched rays.</P>
<P>The first dorsal fin is very singular, the first ray being setaceous, and so long as to extend almost to the tail: those of the second dorsal fins are of a mo∣derate length, except the last, which is produced far beyond the others.</P>
<P>The anus is placed about the middle of the belly; the anal fin is broad, and the last ray the longest. <HI>Pontoppidan</HI> calls this species the flying fish: whe∣ther it makes use of any of its fins to raise itself out of the water, as he was informed they did, we cannot pretend to say.</P>
<P>The tail is rounded and long, and consists of ten rays.</P>

<P>THE qualities of this fish were well known to the antients, who take notice of them without any exaggeration: the wounds inflicted by its spines are exceedingly painful, attended with a violent burn∣ing, and most pungent shooting, and sometimes with an inflammation that will extend from the arm to the shoulder <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is probable that the malignity of the symptoms arises from the habit of body the person is in, or the part in which the wound is given.</NOTE></P>
<P>It is a common notion that these symptoms pro∣ceed from something more than the small wound this fish is capable of inflicting; and that there is a venom infused into it, at lest into such as is made by
<PB N="135" REF="157"/>the spines that form the first dorsal fin, which is dyed with black, and has a most suspicious aspect. The remedy used by a fisherman in our neighbourhood is the sea sand, with which he rubs the place affected for a considerable time <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the <HI>Universal Museum</HI> for <HI>November</HI> 1765, is an instance of a person who was reduced to great danger by a wound from this fish, and who was cured by the application of sweet oil, and taking <HI>opium</HI> and <HI>venice treacle.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>This fish buries itself in the sands, leaving only its nose out, and if trod on immediately strikes with great force; and we have seen them direct their blows with as much judgment as fighting cocks. Notwithstanding this noxious property of the spines, it is exceeding good meat.</P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> name seems to have no meaning, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Name.</NOTE> being corrupted from the <HI>French, la vive,</HI> so called as being capable of living long out of the water, according to the interpretation of <HI>Belon.</HI></P>
<P>It grows to the length of twelve inches, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Descr.</NOTE> but is commonly found much less.</P>
<P>The irides are yellow: the under jaw is longer than the upper, and slopes very much towards the belly: the teeth are small.</P>
<P>The back is strait, the sides flat, the belly promi∣nent, the lateral line strait: the covers of the gills are armed with a very strong sharp spine.</P>
<P>The first dorsal fin consists of five very strong sharp spines, which, as well as the intervening mem∣branes are tinged with black; this fin, when quies∣cent, is lodged in a small hollow.</P>
<P>The second consists of several soft rays, com∣mences just at the end of the first, and continues
<PB N="136" REF="158"/>almost to the tail. The pectoral fins are pretty broad and angular; the ventral fins small.</P>
<P>The vent is placed remarkably forward, very near the throat: the anal fin extends from it to a small distance from the tail, is a little hollowed in the mid∣dle, but not so much as to be called forked.</P>
<P>The sides of this fish are marked lengthways with two or three dirty yellow lines, and transversely by numbers of small ones: the belly is silvery.</P>

<P>THIS fish is found only in the northern part of the world; it is, as <HI>Rondeletius</HI> calls it, an ocean fish, and never met with in the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> sea. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">None (says Captain <HI>Armstrong</HI> in his History of <HI>Minorca</HI>) of the <HI>Aselli</HI> or cod fish kind, frequent our shores, <HI>p.</HI> 163.</NOTE>. It affects cold climates, and seems confined
<PB N="138" REF="160"/>between the latitudes 66 and 50: what are caught north and south of those degrees being either few in quantity, or bad in quality. The <HI>Greenland</HI> fish are small and emaciated thro' want of food, being very voracious, and having in those seas a dearth of pro∣vision.</P>
<P>This locality of situation is common to many other species of this genus, most of them being in∣habitants of the cold seas, or such that lie within zones that can just clame the title of temperate. There are nevertheless certain species found near the <HI>Ganary Islands,</HI> called <HI>Cherny</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. Canary Islands, <HI>198.</HI></NOTE>, of which we know no more than the name; but according to the un∣fortunate Captain <HI>Glas,</HI> are better tasted than the <HI>Newfoundland</HI> kind.</P>
<P>The great rendezvouz of the cod fish is on the Banks of <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> and the other sand banks that lie off the coasts of <HI>Cape Breton, Nova Scotia,</HI> and <HI>New England.</HI> They prefer those situations, by reason of the quantity of worms produced in those sandy bottoms, which tempt them to resort there for food: but another cause of the particular attach∣ment the fish have to these spots, is their vicinity to the polar seas, where they return to spawn; there they depose their roes in full security, but want of food forces them, as soon as the first more southern seas are open, to repair thither for subsistence.</P>
<P>Few are taken north of <HI>Iceland,</HI> but on the south and west coasts they abound: they are again found to swarm on the coasts of <HI>Norway,</HI> in the <HI>Baltic,</HI> off the <HI>Orkney</HI> and the <HI>Western Isles;</HI> after which their
<PB N="139" REF="161"/>numbers decrease, in proportion as they advance to∣wards the south, when they seem quite to cease be∣fore they reach the mouth of the Straits of <HI>Gib∣raltar.</HI></P>
<P>Before the discovery of <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> the greater fisheries of cod were in the seas of <HI>Iceland,</HI> and of our <HI>Western Isles,</HI> which were the grand resort of ships of all the commercial nations; but it seems that the greatest plenty was met with near <HI>Iceland;</HI> for we find Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> condescending to ask permission to fish in those seas from <HI>Christian</HI> the IVth. of <HI>Denmark,</HI> yet afterwards she so far repent∣ed her request, as to instruct her embassadors to that court, to insist on the right of a free and universal fishery <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rymer</HI>'s <HI>Foed.</HI> xvi. 275, 425.</NOTE></P>
<P>But the <HI>Spanish,</HI> the <HI>French,</HI> and the <HI>Britons,</HI> had much the advantage of us in all fisheries at the be∣ginning, as appears by the state of that in the seas of <HI>Newfoundland</HI> in the year 1578 <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hackluyt</HI>'s <HI>Coll. Voy.</HI> iii. 132.</NOTE>, when the number of ships belonging to each nation stood thus:
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Spaniards,</HI> 100, besides 20 or 30 that came from <HI>Biscaie,</HI> to take whale for train, being about five or six thousand tons.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Portuguese,</HI> 50, or three thousand tons.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>French</HI> and <HI>Britons,</HI> 150, or seven thousand tons.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>English,</HI> from 30 to 50.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>But Mr. <HI>Anderson,</HI> in his Dictionary of Commerce, I. 363, says, that the <HI>French</HI> began to fish there so
<PB N="140" REF="162"/>early as 1536; and we think we have somewhere read, that their first pretence for fishing for cod in those seas, was only to supply an <HI>English</HI> convent with that article.</P>
<P>The encrease of shipping that resort to those fer∣tile banks, are now unspeakable: our own country still enjoys the greatest share, which ought to be es∣teemed our chiefest treasure, as it brings wealth to individuals, and strength to the state.</P>
<P>All this immense fishery is carried on by the hook and line only <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We have been informed that they fish in the depth of from fifteen to sixty fathoms, according to the inequality of the <HI>Bank,</HI> which is represented as a vast mountain under water above five hundred miles long, and near three hundred broad, and that seamen knew when they approach it by the great swell of the sea, and the thick mists that impend over it.</NOTE>; the bait is herring, a small fish called a <HI>Capelin,</HI> a shell fish called <HI>Clams,</HI> and bits of sea fowl; and with these are caught fish sufficient to find employ for near fifteen thousand <HI>British</HI> seamen, and to afford subsistence to a much more numerous body of people at home, who are engaged in the various manufactures which so vast a fishery demands.</P>
<P>The food of the cod is either small fish, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Food.</NOTE> worms, testaceous, or crustaceous animals, such as crabs, large whelks, &amp;c. and their digestion is so powerful, as to dissolve the greatest part of the shells they swallow. They are very voracious, and catch at any small body they perceive moved by the water, even stones and pebbles, which are often found in their stomachs.</P>
<P>Providence hath kindly ordained that this fish, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Vastly prolific.</NOTE> so useful to mankind, should be so very prolific as to
<PB N="141" REF="163"/>supply more than the deficiencies of the multitudes annually taken. <HI>Leuwenhoek</HI> counted nine millions three hundred and eighty-four thousand eggs in a cod fish of a middling size, a number sure that will baffle all the efforts of man, or the voracity of the inhabitants of the ocean to exterminate, and which will secure to all ages an inexhaustible supply of grateful provision.</P>
<P>In our seas they begin to spawn in <HI>January,</HI> and deposite their eggs in rough ground, among rocks. Some continue in roe till the beginning of <HI>April.</HI> The cod fish in general recover quicker after spawn∣ing than any other fish, therefore it is common to take some good ones all the summer. When they are out of s;eason they are thin tailed and lousy, and the lice chiefly fix themselves on the inside of their mouths.</P>
<P>The fish of a middling size are most esteemed for the table, and are chosen by their plumpness and roundness, especially near the tail, by the depth of the sulcus or pit behind the head, and by the regular undulated appearance of the sides, as if they were ribbed. The glutinous parts about the head lose their delicate flavor after it has been twenty-four hours out of the water, even in winter, in which these and other fish of this genus are in highest season.</P>
<P>The largest that we ever heard of taken on our coasts weighed sixty-nine pounds, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Size.</NOTE> but the general weight on the <HI>Yorkshire</HI> seas is from fourteen to forty.</P>
<P>This species is short in proportion to its bulk, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Descr.</NOTE> the belly being very large and prominent.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="164"/>The jaws are of an equal length, at the end of the lower is a small beard; the teeth are disposed in the palate as well as jaws.</P>
<P>The eyes are large.</P>
<P>On the back are three soft fins; the first has four∣teen, the two last nineteen rays a-piece. The ven∣tral fins are very slender, and consist but of six rays; the two first extending far beyond the others. It has two anal fins; the first consisting of twenty, the last of sixteen rays.</P>
<P>The tail is almost even at the end: the first ray on each side is short, and composed of a strong bone.</P>
<P>The color of this fish is cinereous on the back and sides, and commonly spotted with yellow: the belly is white, but they vary much, not only in color <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Codlings are often taken of a yellow, orange, and even red color, while they remain among the rocks, but on changing their place assume the color of other cod fish.</NOTE> but in shape, particularly that of the head.</P>

The words <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Arist. Hist. an. lib. <HI>viii.</HI> c. <HI>15.</HI> Oppian Halieut. <HI>I. 151. iii. 191.</HI></NOTE><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Ovidii Halieut. lin. <HI>131.</HI> Plinii lib. <HI>ix.</HI> c. <HI>16.17.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Asinus, Asellus,</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lib. c. <HI>17.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Callarias,</HI> and <HI>Bacchus,</HI> are familiarly applied
<PB N="145" REF="167"/>to several of our species of cod fish by the more modern writers; yet the antients from whom they are borrowed, have not authorized the application to any particular kind, either by description or any other method.</P>
<P>Different reasons have been assigned for giving the name of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <HI>Asinus</HI> to this genus, some ima∣gining it to be from the color of the fish, others be∣cause it used to be carried on the backs of asses to market; but we shall drop this uncertain subject, and proceed to what we have fuller assurance of.</P>
<P>Large hadocks begin to be in roe the middle of <HI>November,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Season.</NOTE> and continue so till the end of <HI>January;</HI> from that time till <HI>May</HI> they are very thin tailed, and much out of season. In <HI>May</HI> they begin to re∣cover, and some of the middling-sized fish are then very good, and continue improving till the time of their greatest perfection. The small ones are ex∣tremely good from <HI>May</HI> till <HI>February,</HI> and some even in <HI>February, March,</HI> and <HI>April,</HI> viz. those which are not old enough to breed.</P>
<P>The fishermen assert, that in rough weather ha∣docks sink down into the sand, and ooze in the bot∣tom of the sea, and shelter themselves there till the storm is over, because in stormy weather they take none, and those that are taken immediately after a storm are covered with mud on their backs.</P>
<P>In summer they live on young herrings and other small fish; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Food.</NOTE> in winter on the stone-coated worms <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A species of <HI>Serpula.</HI></NOTE>, which the fishermen call <HI>hadock meat.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="168"/>The grand shoal of hadocks comes periodically on the <HI>Yorkshire</HI> coasts. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Vast shoals.</NOTE> It is remarkable that they ap∣peared in 1766 on the 10th of <HI>December,</HI> and exactly on the same day in 1767: these shoals extended from the shore near three miles in breadth, and in length from <HI>Flamborough</HI> head to <HI>Tinmouth</HI> castle, and per∣haps much farther northwards. An idea may be given of their numbers by the following fact: three fishermen, within the distance of a mile from <HI>Scarbo∣rough</HI> harbour, frequently loaded their <HI>coble</HI> or boat with them twice a-day, taking each time about a ton of fish: when they put down their lines beyond the distance of three miles from the shore, they caught nothing but dog fish, which shows how exactly these fish keep their limits.</P>
<P>The best hadocks were sold from eightpence to a shilling per score, and the poor had the smaller sort at a penny, and sometimes a halfpenny per score <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here Mr. <HI>Travis,</HI> to whom I am much obliged for a most accurate account of the <HI>Yorkshire</HI> fish, with great humanity pro∣jects an inland navigation, to convey at a cheap and easy me∣thod, those gifts of Providence to the thousands of poor manu∣facturers who inhabit the distant parts of that vast county.</NOTE></P>
<P>The large hadocks quit the coast as soon as they go out of season, and leave behind great plenty of small ones. It is said that the large ones visit the coasts of <HI>Hamburgh</HI> and <HI>Jutland</HI> in the summer.</P>
<P>It is no less remarkable than providential, that all kinds of fish (except mackrel) which frequent the <HI>Yorkshire</HI> coast, approach the shore, and as if it were offer themselves to us, generally remaining there as long as they are in high season, and retire from us when they become unfit for use.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="169"/>It is the commonest species in the <HI>London</HI> markets.</P>
<P>They do not grow to a great bulk, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Descr.</NOTE> one of four∣teen pounds being of an uncommon size, but those are extremely coarse; the best for the table weigh∣ing from two to three pounds.</P>
<P>The body is long, and rather more slender than those of the preceding kinds: the head slopes down to the nose: the space between the hind part of the first dorsal fin is ridged: on the chin is a short beard.</P>
<P>On the back are three fins resembling those of the common cod fish: on each side beyond the gills is a large black spot. Superstition assigns this mark to the impression St. <HI>Peter</HI> left with his finger and thumb when he took the tribute out of the mouth of a fish of this species, which has been continued to the whole race of hadocks ever since that mi∣racle.</P>
<P>The lateral line is black: the tail is forked.</P>

<P>The young begin to appear on the <HI>Yorkshire</HI> coast the beginning of <HI>July</HI> in vast shoals, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Young.</NOTE> and are at that time about an inch and an half long. In <HI>August</HI> they are from three to five inches in length, and are taken in great numbers with the angling rod, and are then esteemed a very delicate fish, but grow so coarse when they are a year old that few people will eat them. Fish of that age are from eight to fif∣teen inches long, and begin to have a little black∣ness
<PB N="153" REF="176"/>near the gills, and on the back, and the black∣ness encreases as they grow older.</P>
<P>The fry is known by different names in different places: they are called at <HI>Scarborough Parrs,</HI> and when a year old, <HI>Billets.</HI> About nine or ten years ago such a glut of <HI>Parrs</HI> visited that part, that for several weeks it was impossible to dip a pail into the sea without taking some.</P>
<P>Tho' this fish is so little esteemed when fresh, yet it is salted and dried for sale; a person last year hav∣ing cured above a thousand at <HI>Scarborough.</HI></P>
<P>The coal fish is of more elegant form than the cod fish: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Descr.</NOTE> they generally grow to the length of two feet and an half, and weigh about twenty-eight or thirty pounds at most. The head is small; the under jaw a little longer than the upper: the irides silvery, marked on one side with a black spot.</P>
<P>It has three dorsal fins, the first consists of four∣teen, the next of twenty, the last of twenty-two rays.</P>
<P>The pectoral fins of eighteen; the ventral of six: the first anal fin of twenty-two, the second of nine∣teen.</P>
<P>The tail is broad and forked.</P>
<P>These fish vary in color. We have seen some whose back, nose, dorsal fins and tail were of a deep black: the gill covers silver and black: the ventral and anal fins white; the belly of the same color.</P>
<P>We have seen others dusky, others brown, but in all the lateral line was strait and white, and the lower part of the ventral and anal fins white.</P>

<P>THIS species is common on many of our rocky coasts: during summer they are seen in great shoals frolicking on the surface of the water, and flinging themselves into a thousand forms. They are at that time so wanton as to bite at any thing that appears on the top of the waves, and are often taken with a goose's feather fixed to the hook.

<P>A FISH that is found in vast abundance on many of our coasts, and of those of <HI>Ireland.</HI> There was formerly a vast stationary fishery of <HI>Hake</HI> on the <HI>Nymph Bank</HI> off the coast of <HI>Waterford,</HI> im∣mense quantities appearing there twice a year; the first shoal coming in <HI>June,</HI> during the <HI>Mackrel</HI> sea∣son, the other in <HI>September,</HI> at the beginning of the <HI>Herring</HI> season, probably in pursuit of those fish: it was no unusual thing for six men with hooks and lines to take a thousand <HI>Hake</HI> in one night, besides a considerable quantity of other fish. These were salted and sent to <HI>Spain,</HI> particularly to <HI>Bilboa.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smith's Hist, Waterford, <HI>261.</HI></NOTE> We are
<PB N="157" REF="180"/>at this time uninformed of the state of this fishery, but find that Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> who wrote the History of the County of <HI>Waterford,</HI> complain even in his time (1746) of its decline. Many of the gregarious fish are subject to change their situations, and desert their haunts for numbers of years, and then return again. We see p. 78, how unsettled the <HI>Basking Shark</HI> appears to be: Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> instances the loss of the <HI>Hadock</HI> on the <HI>Waterford</HI> shores, where they used to swarm; and to our own knowledge we can bring the capriciousness of the herrings, which so frequently quit their stations, as another example.</P>
<P>Sometimes the irregular migration of fish is ow∣ing to their being followed and harassed by an un∣usual number of fish of prey, such as the shark kind.</P>
<P>Sometimes to deficiency of the smaller fish, which served them as food.</P>
<P>And lastly, in many places to the custom of trawl∣ing, which not only demolishes a quantity of their spawn, which is deposited in the sand, but also de∣stroys or drives into deeper waters numberless worms and insects, the repast of many fish.</P>
<P>The hake is in <HI>England</HI> esteemed a very coarse fish, and is seldom admitted to table either fresh or salted <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When cured it is known by the name of <HI>Poor John.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>These fish are from a foot and an half to near twice that length: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Descr.</NOTE> they are of a slender make, of a pale ash color on their backs, and of a dirty white on their bellies.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="181"/>Their head is flat and broad; the mouth very wide; the teeth very long and sharp, particularly those of the lower jaw.</P>
<P>The first dorsal fin is small, consisting of nine rays; the second reaches from the base of the former al∣most to the tail, and is composed of forty rays, of which the last are the highest: the pectoral fins have about twelve, the ventral seven: the anal thirty∣nine.</P>

<P><PB N="159" REF="182"/>We place it in this genus, as it has more the appear∣ance of the cod-fish kind, the hake especially, than of the <HI>Blenny,</HI> into which genus <HI>Linnaeus</HI> has flung it; we therefore have given this species the name of the <HI>Lesser Hake.</HI></P>
<P>The length of one that was taken on the <HI>Flintshire</HI> shores was eleven inches and an half, its greatest depth three inches; but according to Doctor <HI>Borlase,</HI> some grow to be above eighteen inches long.</P>
<P>The head sloped down to the nose in the same easy manner with others of this genus: the mouth large: besides the teeth in the jaws was a triangu∣lar congeries of small teeth in the roof of the mouth.</P>
<P>At the end of the lower jaw was a small beard. The first dorsal fin was triangular; the first ray ex∣tended far beyond the rest, and was very slender: the second fin began just behind the first, and extended almost to the tail: the ventral fins were three inches long, and consisted of only two rays, joined at the bottom, and separated or bifurcated towards the end: the vent was in the middle of the body: the anal fin extended from thence just to the tail: the lateral line was incurvated: the tail was rounded.</P>

<P>THE ling takes its name from its length, being corrupted from the word <HI>long.</HI> It abounds about the <HI>Scilly Isles,</HI> on the coasts of <HI>Scarborough,</HI>
<PB N="161" REF="184"/>and those of <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and forms a con∣siderable article of commerce <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This branch of trade was considerable so long ago as the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> III. an act for regulating the price of <HI>Lob, Ling,</HI> and <HI>Cod,</HI> being made in his 31st year.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the <HI>Yorkshire</HI> seas they are in perfection from the beginning of <HI>February</HI> to the beginning of <HI>May,</HI> and some till the end of that month. In <HI>June</HI> they spawn, depositing their eggs in the soft oozy ground of the mouth of the <HI>Tees:</HI> at that time the males separate from the females, and resort to some rocky ground near <HI>Flamborough Head,</HI> where the fishermen take great numbers without ever finding any of the female or roed fish among them.</P>
<P>While a ling is in season its liver is very white, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Oil.</NOTE> and abounds with a fine flavored oil; but as soon as the fish goes out of season, the liver becomes red as that of a bullock, and affords no oil. The same hap∣pens to the cod and other fish in a certain degree, but not so remarkably as in the ling. When the fish is in perfection, a very large quantity of oil may be melted out of the liver by a slow fire, but if a violent sudden heat be used for that purpose, they yield very little. This oil, which nature hoards up in the cellular membranes of fishes, returns into their blood, and supports them in the engendring season, when they pursue the business of generation with so much eagerness as to neglect their food.</P>
<P>Vast quantities of ling is salted for exportation, as well as for home consumption. When it is cut or split for curing, it must measure twenty-six inches or upwards from the shoulder to the tail; if less than
<PB N="162" REF="185"/>that it is not reckoned a sizeable fish, and conse∣quently not entitled to the bounty on exportation; such are called <HI>Drizzles,</HI> and are in season all sum∣mer.</P>
<P>The ufual size of a ling is from three to four feet; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Descr.</NOTE> but we have heard of one that was seven feet long.</P>
<P>The body is very slender; the head flat; the up∣per jaw the longest; the teeth in that jaw small and very numerous; in the lower, few, slender, and sharp: on the chin is a small beard.</P>
<P>The first dorsal fin is small, placed near the head, and consists of fifteen rays: the second is very long, reaching almost to the tail, and consists of sixty-five rays: the pectoral fins have fifteen radiated rays, the ventral fins six; the anal sixty-two: the tail is rounded at the end.</P>

<P>The teeth slender, almost setaceous, and very close set: between the eyes was a small hollow, and above each just on the summit was a narrow loose membrane, trifurcated at the top, which distinguishes this from all other species.</P>
<P>The pectoral fins broad and rounded, consisting of fourteen rays, which extend beyond the webs, making the edges appear scalloped.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="192"/>The ventral fins like those of others of the genus: the dorsal fin consisted of fourteen strong spiny rays, and nineteen soft rays; the last of which were higher than the spiny rays.</P>
<P>The anal fin had twenty-one rays: the ends in every fin extended beyond their webs.</P>
<P>The tail was rounded at the end, and consisted of twelve rays, divided towards their extremities.</P>
<P>This fish in general was of a dusky hue, marked across with wavy lines: the belly of a light-ash color.</P>
<P>The lower part of the pectoral fins, and the ends of the ventral fins, of an orange color.</P>
<P>With a smooth head.</P>

<P>WE discovered this species in plenty lying un∣der the stones among the tang on the rocky coasts of <HI>Anglesea,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Place.</NOTE> at the lower water-mark. It was very active and vivacious, and would by the help
<PB N="170" REF="193"/>of its ventral fins creep up between the stones with great facility. It bit extremely hard, and would hang at ones finger for a considerable time. It was very tenacious of life, and would live for near a day out of water.</P>
<P>It feeds on shells and small crabs, whose remains we found in its stomach.</P>
<P>The length in general was five inches: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Descr.</NOTE> the head large, and sloping suddenly to the mouth: the irides red.</P>
<P>The teeth slender, very sharp, and close set: there were twenty-four in the upper, and nineteen in the lower jaw.</P>
<P>The pectoral fins broad and rounded, consisting of thirteen rays: the ventral fins of only two thick rays, separated near their ends.</P>
<P>The dorsal fin consisted of thirty-two soft rays, and reached from the hind part of the head almost to the tail.</P>
<P>The vent was in the middle of the body: the anal fin extended almost to the tail, and consisted of nineteen rays, tipt with white.</P>
<P>The tail rounded at the end, and composed of twelve branched rays.</P>

<P>It is rather difficult at this time to determine on which part to decide the dispute; for the <HI>Doree</HI> like∣wise asserts an origin of its spots of a similar nature, but of a much earlier date than the former. St.

St. <HI>Christopher</HI> was of a <HI>Colossal</HI> stature, as is evident from his image in the church of <HI>Notre Dame</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> and a still larger at <HI>Auxerre:</HI> the last we think is near seventy feet high. His history is expressed in his name, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, being said to have carried our Saviour, when a child, over an arm of the sea.</NOTE>, in wading thro' an arm of the sea, hav∣ing caught a fish of this kind <HI>en passant,</HI> as an eter∣nal memorial of the fact, left the impressions on its sides to be transmitted to all posterity. Could this but be established, we should not hesitate to pro∣nounce in favor of the hadock.</P>
<P>In our own country it was very long before this fish attracted our notice, at left as an edible one. We are indebted to that judicious actor and <HI>bon vivant</HI> the late Mr. <HI>Quin,</HI> for adding a most delicious fish to our table, who overcoming all the vulgar pre∣judices on account of its deformity, has effectually established its reputation.</P>
<P>This fish was supposed to be found only in the southern seas of this kingdom, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Place.</NOTE> but it has been dis∣covered last year on the coast of <HI>Anglesea.</HI> Those of the greatest size are taken in the <HI>Bay</HI> of <HI>Biscay</HI> off the <HI>French</HI> coasts: they are also very common in the <HI>Mediterranean; Ovid</HI> must therefore have styled it <HI>rarus Faber,</HI> on account of its excellency not its scarcity.</P>
<P>The form of this fish is hideous: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Descr.</NOTE> its body is oval, and greatly compressed on the sides: the head large: the snout vastly projecting: the mouth very wide: the teeth very small.</P>
<P>The eyes great: the irides yellow.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="208"/>The lateral line oddly distorted, sinking at each end, and rising near the back in the middle: beneath it on each side is a round black spot.</P>
<P>The first dorsal fin consists of ten strong spiny rays, with long filaments, reaching far beyond their ends: the second is placed near the tail, and consists of twenty-four soft rays, the middlemost of which are the longest.</P>
<P>The pectoral fins have fourteen rays, the ventral seven; the first spiny, the others soft: it has two anal fins; the first consists of four sharp spines, the second of twenty-two soft ones, and reaches very near the tail.</P>

<P>It may very easily be distinguished from the plaise, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Descr.</NOTE> or any other fish of this genus, by a row of sharp small spines that surround its upper sides, and are

<P>We have met with a variety of this fish with the eyes and lateral line on the left side. <HI>Linnaeus</HI> makes a distinct species of it under the name of <HI>Pleuronec∣tes Passer,</HI> p. 459; but since it differs in no other respect from the common kind, we agree with Doctor <HI>Gronovius</HI> in not separating them.</P>

</LIST>
<P>TURBOTS grow to a very large size; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Size.</NOTE> we have seen them of three and twenty pounds weight, but have heard of some that weighed thirty. They are taken chiefly off the north coast of <HI>England,</HI> and others off the <HI>Dutch</HI> coast; but we believe the last has, in many instances, more credit than it de∣serves for the abundance of its fish.</P>
<P>The large turbots, and several other kinds of flat fish, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fishery.</NOTE> are taken by the hook and line, for they lye in deep water: the method of taking them in wares, or staked nets, is too precarious to be de∣pended on for the supply of our great markets, be∣cause it is by meer accident that the great fish stray into them.</P>
<P>It is a misfortune to the inhabitants of many of our fishing coasts, especially those of the north part of <HI>North Wales,</HI> that they are unacquainted with the
<PB N="193" REF="218"/>most successful means of capture: for their benefit, and perhaps that of other parts of our island, we shall lay before them the method practised by the fishermen of <HI>Scarborough,</HI> as it was communicated to us by Mr. <HI>Travis.</HI></P>
<P>When they go out to fish, each person is provided with three lines. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lines.</NOTE> Each man's lines are fairly coiled upon a flat oblong piece of wicker-work; the hooks being baited, and placed very regularly in the centre of the coil. Each line is furnished with 14 score of hooks, at the distance of six feet two inches from each other. The hooks are fastened to the lines upon sneads of twisted horse-hair, 27 inches in length.</P>
<P>When fishing there are always three men in each coble, and consequently nine of these lines are fas∣tened together, and used as one line, extending in length near three miles, and furnished with 2520 hooks. An anchor and a buoy are fixed at the first end of the line, and one more of each at the end of each man's lines; in all four anchors, which are commonly perforated stones, and four buoys made of leather or cork. The line is always laid across the current. The tides of flood and ebb continue an equal time upon our coast, and when undisturbed by winds run each way about six hours. They are so rapid that the fishermen can only shoot and haul their lines at the turn of tide; and therefore the lines always remain upon the ground about six hours <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In this space the <HI>myxine glutinosa</HI> of <HI>Linnaeus,</HI> will frequently penetrate the fish that are on the hooks, and entirely devour them, leaving only the skin and bones.</NOTE>. The same rapidity of tide prevents their using hand∣lines;
<PB N="194" REF="219"/>and therefore two of the people commonly wrap themselves in the sail, and sleep while the other keeps a strict look-out, for fear of being run down by ships, and to observe the weather. For storms often rise so suddenly, that it is with extreme difti∣culty they can sometimes escape to the shore, leav∣ing their lines behind.</P>
<P>The coble is 20 feet 6 inches long, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Coble.</NOTE> and 5 feet ex∣treme breadth. It is about one ton burthen, rowed with three pair of oars, and admirably constructed for the purpose of encountering a mountanous sea: they hoist sail when the wind suits.</P>
<P>The five-men boat is 40 feet long and 15 broad, and of 25 tons burthen: it is so called, tho' navigated by six men and a boy, because one of the men is commonly hired to cook, &amp;c. and does not share in the profits with the other five. All our able fisher∣men go in these boats to the herring fishery at <HI>Yar∣mouth</HI> the latter end of <HI>September,</HI> and return about the middle of <HI>November.</HI> The boats are then laid up until the beginning of <HI>Lent,</HI> at which time they go off in them to the edge of the <HI>Dogger,</HI> and other places, to fish for turbot, cod, ling, skates, &amp;c. They always take two cobles on board, and when they come upon their ground, anchor the boat, throw out the cobles, and fish in the same manner as those do who go from the shore in a coble, with this dif∣ference only; that here each man is provided with double the quantity of lines, and instead of wait∣ing the return of tide in the coble, return to the boat and bait their other lines; thus hawling one set, and shooting another every turn of tide. They
<PB N="195" REF="220"/>commonly run into harbour twice a week to deliver their fish. The five-men boat is decked at each end, but open in the middle, and has two large lug-sails.</P>
<P>The best bait for all kinds of fish is fresh herring cut in pieces of a proper size; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Bait.</NOTE> and notwithstanding what has been said to the contrary, they are taken here at any time in the winter, and all the spring, whenever the fishermen put down their nets for that purpose. The five-men boats always take some nets for that end. Next to herrings are the lesser lam∣preys <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Dutch</HI> also use these fish as baits in the turbot fishery, and purchase annually from the <HI>Thames</HI> fishermen as much as amounts to 700<HI>l.</HI> worth, for that purpose.</NOTE>, which come all winter by land-carriage from <HI>Tadcaster.</HI> The next baits in esteem are small ha∣docks cut in pieces, sand worms, muscles, and lim∣pets (called here <HI>Flidders;</HI>) and lastly, when none of these can be had they use bullock's liver. The hooks used here are much smaller than those em∣ployed at <HI>Iceland</HI> and <HI>Newfoundland.</HI> Experience has shewn that the larger fish will take a living small one upon the hook, sooner than any bait that can be put on; therefore they use such as the small fish can swallow. The hooks are two inches and an half long in the shank, and near an inch wide between the shank and the point. The line is made of small cording, and is always tanned before it is used.</P>
<P>Turbots, and all the rays, are extremely delicate in their choice of baits. If a piece of herring or hadock has been twelve hours out of the sea, and then used as bait, they will not touch it.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="221"/>This and the pearl are of a remarkable square form: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Descr.</NOTE> the color of the upper part of the body is cine∣reous, marked with numbers of black spots of dif∣ferent sizes: the belly is white: the skin is without scales, but greatly wrinkled, and mixed with small short spines, dispersed without any order.</P>

<P>WE have only four instances of this fish being taken in our seas, each of them in the <HI>North,</HI> viz. twice off <HI>Scotland</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The fish engraved by Sir <HI>Robert Sibbald, Hist. Scot. tab.</HI> 6. and thus described, is of this kind. <HI>Piscis maculis aureis asper∣sus non scriptus, pollices</HI> 42 <HI>longus.</HI></NOTE>, once off <HI>Northum∣berland,</HI> and once in <HI>Filey-Bay, Yorkshire.</HI> This last was caught about two years ago, and exhibited as a shew at <HI>Scarborough.</HI></P>
<P>It is of that genus which <HI>Linnaeus</HI> distinguishes by the name of <HI>Chaetodon,</HI> from its bristly teeth, and is said to be very common on the coast of <HI>Guinea.</HI></P>
<P>It is well described by an anonymous writer in the <HI>London Magazine</HI> for <HI>October,</HI> 1767, which we shall borrow, as the account is confirmed to us by Mr. <HI>Travis,</HI> who had an opportunity of examining one of the same species.</P>
<P><HI>Newcastle, Sept.</HI> 12. On <HI>Saturday</HI> last was thrown upon the sands at <HI>Blyth,</HI> a very rare and beautiful fish, weighing between seventy and eighty pounds <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">That described in the <HI>Philosophical Transactions</HI> weighed eighty-two pounds.</NOTE>,
<PB N="202" REF="227"/>shaped like the sea bream. The length was three feet and an half; the breadth from back to belly almost two feet; but the thickness from side to side not above six inches.</P>
<P>The mouth small for the size of the fish, forming a square opening, and without any teeth in the jaws. The tongue thick, resembling that of a man, but rough and thick set with beards or prickles, pointing backwards, so that any thing might easily pass down, but could not easily return back, there∣fore these might serve instead of teeth to retain its prey <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The writer omitted the description of the tongue and its setaceous teeth, which we supply from the <HI>Transactions.</HI></NOTE>. The eyes remarkably large, covered with a membrane, and shining with a glare of gold. The cover of the gills like the salmon.</P>
<P>The body diminishes very small to the tail, which is forked, and expands twelve inches: the gill fins are broad, about eight inches long, and play hori∣zontally: a little behind their insertion the back fin takes its original, where it is about seven inches high, but slopes away very suddenly, running down very near the tail, and at its termination becomes a little broader: the belly fins are very strong, and placed near the middle of the body: a narrow fin also runs from the anus to the tail.</P>
<P>All the fins, and also the tail, are of a fine scarlet; but the colours and beauty of the rest of the body, which is smooth and covered with almost impercep∣ticle scales, beggars all description; the upper part being a kind of bright green, variegated with whi∣tish
<PB N="203" REF="228" MS="y"/>spots, and enriched with a shining golden hue, much resembling the splendor of the peacock's fea∣thers; this by degrees vanishes in a bright silver; and near the belly the gold begins again to predomi∣nate in a lighter ground than on the back.</P>

<P>THIS species is found in deep water adjacent to the rocks. It will take a bait, tho' its usual food is shell-fish, and small crustacea.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="229"/>It grows to the weight of four or five pounds: it bears some resemblance to a carp in the form of the body, and is covered with large scales.</P>

<P>The irides are red: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Teeth.</NOTE> the teeth are disposed in two rows; the first are conic, the second very minute, and as if supporters to the others: in the throat just before the gullet are three bones, two above of an oblong form, and one below of a triangular shape; the surface of each rising into roundish protube∣rances: these are of singular use to the fish, to grind its shelly food before it arrives at the sto∣mach.</P>
<P>The dorsal fin consists of sixteen sharp and spiny rays, and nine soft ones, which are much longer than the others.</P>
<P>The pectoral fins large and round, and are com∣posed of fifteen rays.</P>
<P>The ventral of six; the first sharp and strong: the anal of three sharp spines, and nine flexible.</P>
<P>The tail is rounded at the end, and is formed of fourteen soft branching rays.</P>

That men∣tioned by <HI>Oppian, Pliny,</HI> and <HI>Athenaeus</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Oppian Halieut. <HI>I. 124.</HI> Plinii. lib. <HI>ix.</HI> c. <HI>16.</HI> Athenaeus lib. <HI>vii.</HI> p. <HI>319.</HI></NOTE>, is a sea∣fish probably of the <HI>Labrus</HI> or <HI>Sparus</HI> kind, being enumerated by them among some congenerous spe∣cies. Our perch was much esteemed by the <HI>Ro∣mans:</HI>
<Q><L>Nec te delicias mensarum <HI>Perca,</HI> silebo</L>
<L>Amnigenos inter pisces dignande marinis.</L>
<BIBL>AUSONIUS.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="238"/>It is not less admired at present as a firm and de∣licate fish; and the <HI>Dutch</HI> are particularly fond of it when made into a dish called <HI>Water Souchy.</HI></P>
<P>It is a gregarious fish, and loves deep holes and gentle streams. It is a most voracious fish, and eager biter: if the angler meets with a shoal of them, he is sure of taking every one.</P>
<P>It is a common notion that the pike will not at∣tack this fish, being fearful of the spiny fins which the perch erects on the approach of the former. This may be true in respect to large fish; but it is well known the small ones are the most tempting bait that can be laid for the pike.</P>
<P>The perch is a fish very tenacious of life: we have known them carried near sixty miles in dry straw, and yet survive the journey.</P>
<P>These fish seldom grow to a large size: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Size.</NOTE> we once heard of one that was taken in the <HI>Serpentine</HI> river, <HI>Hyde-Park,</HI> that weighed nine pounds, but that is very uncommon.</P>
<P>The body is deep: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Descr.</NOTE> the scales very rough: the back much arched.</P>
<P>The irides golden: the teeth small, disposed in the jaws and on the roof of the mouth: the edges of the covers of the gills serrated: on the lower end of the largest is a sharp spine.</P>
<P>The first dorsal fin consists of fourteen strong spiny rays; the second of sixteen soft ones: the pec∣toral fins are transparent, and consist of fourteen rays; the ventral of six; the anal of eleven.</P>
<P>The tail is a little forked.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="239"/>The colors are beautiful: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Color.</NOTE> the back and part of the sides being of a deep green, marked with five broad black bars pointing downwards: the belly is white, tinged with red: the ventral fins of a rich scarlet; the anal fins and tail of the same color, but rather paler.</P>
<P>In a lake called <HI>Llyn Raithlyn,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Crooked Perch.</NOTE> in <HI>Merionethshire,</HI> is a very singular variety of perch: the back is quite hunched, and the lower part of the back bone, next the tail, strangely distorted: in color, and in other respects, it resembles the common kind, which are as numerous in the lake as these deformed fish. They are not peculiar to this water, for <HI>Linnaeus</HI> takes notice of a similar variety found at <HI>Fahlun,</HI> in his own country.</P>

<P>THESE are common in many of our rivers, but no where in greater quantities than in the <HI>Fens</HI> of <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> and some of the rivers that creep out of them. At <HI>Spalding</HI> there are, once in seven or eight years, amazing shoals that appear in the <HI>Welland,</HI> and come up the river in form of a vast column. They are supposed to be the multitudes that have been washed out of the fens by the floods of several years, and collected in some deep hole, 'till overcharged with numbers, they are periodically obliged to attempt a change of place. The quan∣tity is so great, that they are used to manure the land, and trials have been made to get oil from
<PB N="218" REF="244"/>them. A notion may be had of this vast shoal, by saying that a man employed by the farmer to take them, has got for a considerable time four shil∣lings a day by selling them at a halfpenny per bushel.</P>
<P>This species seldom reaches the length of two inches: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Descr.</NOTE> the eyes are large: the belly prominent: the body near the tail square: the sides are covered with large bony plates, placed transversely.</P>
<P>On the back are three sharp spines, that can be raised or depressed at pleasure: the dorsal fin is placed near the tail: the pectoral fins are broad: the ventral fins consist each of one spine, or rather plate, of unequal lengths, one being large, the other small; between both is a flat bony plate, reaching almost to the vent: beneath the vent is a short spine, and then succeeds the anal fin.</P>
<P>The tail consists of twelve rays, and is even at the end.</P>
<P>The color of the back and sides is an olive green; the belly white; but in some the lower jaws and belly are of a bright crimson.</P>

<P>THE mackrel is a summer fish of passage that visits our shores in vast shoals. It is less use∣ful than other species of gregarious fish, being very tender, and unfit for carriage; not but that it may be preserved by pickling and salting, a method, we believe, practised only in <HI>Cornwall</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Borlase Cornwall. <HI>269.</HI></NOTE>, where it proves a great relief to the poor during winter.</P>
<P>It was a fish greatly esteemed by the <HI>Romans,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Garum.</NOTE> be∣cause it furnished the pretious <HI>Garum,</HI> a sort of pickle that gave a high relish to their sauces, and was be∣sides used medicinally. It was drawn from different
<PB N="222" REF="248"/>kinds of fish, but that made from the mackrel had the preference: the best was made at <HI>Carthagena,</HI> vast quantities of mackrel being taken near an adja∣centisle, called from that circumstance, <HI>Scombraria</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strabo lib. <HI>iii. 109.</HI></NOTE>, and the <HI>Garum,</HI> prepared by a certain company in that city, bore a high price, and was distinguished by the title of <HI>Garum Sociorum</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Plinii lib. <HI>xxxi.</HI> c. <HI>8.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>This fish is easily taken by a bait, but the best time is during a fresh gale of wind, which is thence called a <HI>mackrel</HI> gale.</P>
<P>It is not often that it exceeds two pounds in weight, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Size.</NOTE> yet we heard that there was one sold last summer in <HI>London</HI> that weighed five and a quarter.</P>
<P>The nose is taper and sharp pointed: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Descr.</NOTE> the eyes large: the jaws of an equal length: the teeth small, but numerous.</P>
<P>The form of this fish is very elegant.</P>
<P>The body is a little compressed on the sides: to∣wards the tail it grows very slender, and a little an∣gular.</P>
<P>The first dorsal fin is placed a little behind the pec∣toral fin, is triangular, and consists of nine or ten stiff rays; the second lies at a distance from the other, and has twelve soft rays; the pectoral twenty; the ventral six: at the base of the anal fin is a strong spine.</P>
<P>Between the last dorsal fin and the tail, are five small fins, and the same number between the anal fin and the tail.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="249"/>The tail is broad and semilunar: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Color.</NOTE> The color of the back and sides above the lateral line, is a fine green, varied with blue, marked with black lines, pointing downwards; beneath the line the sides and belly are of a silvery color.</P>
<P>It is a most beautiful fish when alive; for nothing can equal the brilliancy of its color, which death impairs, but does not wholly obliterate.</P>

<P>The eyes large: the irides purple: the head and covers of the gills very scaly.</P>
<P>The first dorsal fin was lodged in a deep furrow, and consisted of six strong, but flexible rays; the second of eight; the pectoral fins of sixteen; the ventral of six branched rays; the anal of seven: the tail is much forked.</P>
<P>The body very thick, and covered with large scales; beneath them the color was a most beautiful rosyred; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This color is most vivid during summer.</NOTE> the changes of which, under the thin scales, gave that entertainment to the <HI>Roman</HI> epicures as above mentioned: the scales on the back and sides were of a dirty orange; those on the nose a bright yellow: the tail a reddish yellow.</P>

<P>The salmon is a fish that lives both in the salt and fresh waters, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ascends rivers.</NOTE> quitting the sea at certain seasons for
<PB N="241" REF="269"/>the sake of depositing its spawn in security, in the gravelly beds of rivers remote from their mouths. There are scarce any difficulties but what they will overcome, in order to arrive at places fit for their purpose: they will ascend rivers hundreds of miles, force themselves against the most rapid streams, and spring with amazing agility over cataracts of several feet in height. Salmon are frequently taken in the <HI>Rhine</HI> as high up as <HI>Basil;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Salmon leaps.</NOTE> they gain the sources of the <HI>Lapland</HI> rivers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Scheff.

<P>It may here be proper to contradict the vulgar error of their taking their tail in their mouth when they attempt to leap; such as we saw, sprung up quite strait, and with a strong tremulous motion.</P>
<P>Other particulars relating to the natural history of this fish, we shall relate in our accounts of the fisheries, either from our own observations, or from such as have been communicated to us from different places: the fullest we have been favored with is from Mr. <HI>Potts,</HI> of <HI>Berwick,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tweed</HI> fishery.</NOTE> to whom the publick is indebted for the following very curious history of the salmon fishery on the <HI>Tweed.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="270"/>At the latter end of the year, or in the month of <HI>November,</HI> the salmon begin to press up the rivers as far as they can reach, in order to spawn; when that time approaches they search for a place fit for the purpose: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Spawn∣ing.</NOTE> the male and female unite in forming a proper receptacle for it in the sand or gravel, about the depth of eighteen inches; in this the female de∣posits her spawn, the male his milt, which they cover carefully, as it is said, with their tails, for after spawning they are observed to have no skin on that part.</P>
<P>The spawn lies buried till spring, if not disturbed by violent floods; but the salmon hasten to sea as soon as they are able, to purify and cleanse them∣selves, and to recover their strength; for after spawn∣ing they become very poor and lean, and then are called <HI>Kipper.</HI></P>
<P>About the latter end of <HI>March</HI> the spawn begins to exclude the young, which gradually increase to the length of four or five inches, and are then termed <HI>Smelts</HI> or <HI>Smouts:</HI> about the beginning of <HI>May</HI> the river is full of them; it seems to be all alive; there is no having an idea of the numbers without seeing them; but a seasonable flood then hurries them all to the sea, scarce any or very few being left in the river.</P>
<P>About the middle of <HI>June</HI> the earliest of the fry begin to drop, as it were, into the river again from the sea, at that time about twelve, fourteen, or six∣teen inches, and by a gradual progress, increase in number and size till about the end of <HI>July,</HI> which is at <HI>Berwick</HI> termed the height of <HI>Gilse</HI> time, the
<PB N="243" REF="271"/>name given to the fish at that age: the end of <HI>July,</HI> or beginning of <HI>August</HI> they lessen in number, but encrease in size, some being six, seven, eight, or nine pounds in weight; this appears to be a surpri∣sing quick growth, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Quick growth.</NOTE> yet we have received from a gen∣tleman at <HI>Warrington,</HI> an instance still more so: a kipper salmon weighing 7lb. three quarters, taken on the 7th of <HI>February,</HI> being marked with a scissars on the back, fin, and tail, and turned into the river, was again taken the 17th of <HI>March</HI> following, and then was found to weigh 17lb. and a half.</P>
<P>The capture in the <HI>Tweed,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Capture.</NOTE> about the month of <HI>July,</HI> is prodigious; in a good fishery, often a boat load, and sometimes near two, are taken in a tide: some few years ago there were above seven hundred fish taken at one hawl, but from fifty to a hundred is very frequent: the coopers in <HI>Berwick</HI> then begin to salt both <HI>Salmon</HI> and <HI>Gilses</HI> in pipes, and other large vessels, and afterwards barrel <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The salmon barrel holds above forty-two gallons, wine measure.</NOTE> them to send abroad, having then far more than the <HI>London</HI> markets can take off their hands.</P>
<P>Most of the salmon taken before <HI>April,</HI> or to the setting in of the warm weather, is sent fresh to <HI>Lon∣don</HI> in baskets, unless now and then the vessel is dis∣appointed by contrary winds, of sailing immediately; in that case the fish is brought ashore again to the coopers offices, and boiled, pickled, and kitted, and sent to the <HI>London</HI> markets by the same ship, and fresh salmon put in the baskets in lieu of the stale ones. At the beginning of the season, when a ship
<PB N="244" REF="272"/>is on the point of sailing, a fresh clean salmon will sell from a shilling to eighteen pence a pound, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Price.</NOTE> and most of the time that this part of the trade is carried on, the prices are from five to nine shillings per stone, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A stone of salmon weighs 18lb. 100z. ½, or in other terms, four stones, or fifty-six pounds avoirdupoise, is only three stones, or forty-two pounds, fish weight at <HI>Berwick.</HI></NOTE> the value rising and falling according to the value rising and falling according to the plenty of fish, or the prospect of a fair or foul wind. Some fish are sent in this manner to <HI>London</HI> the lat∣ter end of <HI>September,</HI> when the weather grows cool, but then the fish are full of large roes, grow very thin bellied, and are not esteemed either palatable or wholesome.</P>
<P>The price of fresh fish in the month of <HI>July,</HI> when they are most plentiful, has been known to be as low as 8<HI>d.</HI> per stone, but last year never less than 16<HI>d.</HI> and from that to 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>The season for fishing in the <HI>Tweed</HI> begins <HI>No∣vember</HI> the 30th, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Season.</NOTE> but the fishermen work very little till after <HI>Christmas;</HI> it ends on <HI>Michaelmas-Day;</HI> yet the corporation of <HI>Berwick</HI> (who are conservators of the river) indulge the fishermen with a fornight past that time, on account of the change of the style.</P>
<P>There are on the river forty-one considerable fish∣eries extending upwards, about fourteen miles from the mouth (the others above being of no great va∣lue) which are rented for near 5400<HI>l.</HI> per annum. The expences attending the servants wages, nets, boats, &amp;c. amount to 5000<HI>l.</HI> more, which together makes up the sum 10400<HI>l.</HI> Now in consequence
<PB N="245" REF="273"/>the produce must defray all, and no less than twenty times that sum of fish will effect it, so that 208000 salmon must be caught there one year with an∣other.</P>
<P>There is a misfortune attending the river <HI>Tweed,</HI> which is worthy a parlementary remedy; for there is no law for preserving the fish in it during the fence months, as there is in the case of many other <HI>British</HI> rivers. This being the boundary between the two kingdoms, part of it belongs to the city of <HI>Berwick,</HI> and the whole north side (beginning about two miles from the town) is entirely <HI>Scotch</HI> pro∣perty. From some disagreement between the par∣ties they will not unite for the preservation of the fish, so that in some fisheries on the north side they continue killing salmon the whole winter, when the death of one fish is the destruction of thousands.</P>
<P>The legislature began very early to pay attention to this important article: by the 13th <HI>Edward</HI> Ist. there is an act which prohibits the capture of the salmon from the Nativity of our Lady to St. <HI>Mar∣tin</HI>'s Day, in the waters of the <HI>Humber, Owse, Trent, Done, Arre, Derwent, Wharfe, Nid, Yore, Swale,</HI> and <HI>Tees;</HI> and other monarchs in after-times, pro∣vided in like manner for the security of the fish in other rivers.</P>
<P><HI>Scotland</HI> possesses great numbers of fine fisheries on both sides of that kingdom. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Scotland.</NOTE> The salmon are cured in the same manner as at <HI>Berwick,</HI> and a great quantity is sent to <HI>London</HI> in the spring; but after that time the adventurers begin to barrel and ex∣port them to foreign countries: but we believe that
<PB N="246" REF="274"/>commerce is far less lucrative than it was in former times, partly owing to the great encrease of the <HI>Newfoundland</HI> fishery, and partly to the general re∣laxation of the discipline of abstinence in the <HI>Ro∣mish</HI> church.</P>
<P><HI>Ireland</HI> (particularly the north) abounds with this fish: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ireland.</NOTE> the most considerable fishery is at <HI>Cranna,</HI> on the river <HI>Ban,</HI> about a mile and an half from <HI>Cole∣raine.</HI> When I made the tour of that hospitable kingdom in 1754, it was rented by a neighboring gentleman for 620<HI>l.</HI> a year, who assured me that the tenant, his predecessor, gave 1600<HI>l.</HI> per ann. and was a much greater gainer by the bargain for the reasons before-mentioned, and on account of the number of poachers who destroy the fish in the fence months.</P>
<P>The mouth of this river faces the north, and is finely situated to receive the fish that roam along the coast, in search of an inlet into some fresh wa∣ter, as they do all along that end of the kingdom which opposes itself to the northern ocean. We have seen near <HI>Ballicastle,</HI> nets placed in the sea at the foot of the promontories that jut into it, which the salmon strike into as they are wandering close to shore, and numbers are taken by that method.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Ban</HI> they fish with nets eighteen score yards long, and are continually drawing night and day the whole season, which we think lasts about four months, two sets of sixteen men each alter∣nately relieving one another. The best drawing is when the tide is coming in: we were told that at a single draught there were once eight hundred and forty fish taken.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="275"/>A few miles higher up the river is a ware, where a considerable number of fish that escape the nets are taken. We were lately informed, that in the year 1760 about 320 tons were taken in the <HI>Cranna</HI> fishery.</P>
<P>The salmon are cured in this manner: they are first split, and rubbed with fine salt; and after ly∣ing in pickle in great tubs, or reservoirs, for six weeks, are packed up with layers of coarse brown <HI>Spanish</HI> salt in casks, six of which make a ton. These are exported to <HI>Leghorn</HI> and <HI>Venice</HI> at the price of twelve or thirteen pounds per ton, but formerly from sixteen to twenty-four pounds each.</P>
<P>The salmon is a fish so generally known, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Descr.</NOTE> that a very brief description will serve. The largest we ever heard of weighed seventy-four pounds. The color of the back and sides are grey, sometimes spotted with black, sometimes plain: the covers of the gills are subject to the same variety: the belly silvery: the nose sharp pointed: the end of the un∣der jaw in the males often turns up in form of a hook; sometimes this curvature is very considera∣ble: it is said that they lose this hook when they re∣turn to the sea.</P>
<P>The teeth are lodged in the jaws and on the tongue, and are slender, but very sharp.</P>
<P>The tail is a little forked.</P>

<P>WE are uncertain whether this is not a meer variety of the salmon; but on the authority of Mr. <HI>Ray,</HI> we describe them separate. He says it is a very strong fish, that it does not ascend the fresh waters till <HI>August,</HI> when it rushes up with great violence, that it is rarely taken, and not much known.</P>
<P>We saw one last summer caught near <HI>Gloddaeth,</HI> in <HI>Caernarvonshire,</HI> which weighed twenty-two pounds: the body was much deeper than that of the salmon; the head larger: the irides were silvery: the back, first dorsal fin, the sides above the lateral line, were of a deep grey, spotted with numbers of dark purplish spots: the belly silvery: the tail quite even at the end. The fishermen called it a she salmon.</P>

<P>IT is matter of surprize that this common fish has escaped the notice of all the antients, except <HI>Ausonius:</HI> it is also singular, that so delicate a species should be neglected at a time when the folly of the table was at its height; and that the epicures should overlook a fish that is found in such quantities in the lakes of their neighborhood, when they ran∣sacted the universe for dainties. The milts of <HI>Mu∣raenae</HI> were brought from one place; the livers of <HI>Scari</HI> from another; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Suetonius, vita <HI>Vitellii.</HI></NOTE> and <HI>Oysters</HI> even from so re∣mote a spot as our <HI>Sandwich:</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Juvenal Sat. <HI>iv. 141.</HI></NOTE> but there was, and is a fashion in the article of good living.

<P>In fact the colors of the trout, and its spots, vary greatly in different waters, and in different seasons; yet each may be reduced to one species. In <HI>Llyndivi,</HI> a lake in <HI>South Wales,</HI> are trouts called <HI>Coch y dail,</HI> marked with red and black spots as big as six∣pences; others unspotted, and of a reddish hue, that sometimes weigh near ten pounds, but are bad tasted.</P>
<P>In <HI>Lough Neagh</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> are trouts called there <HI>Buddaghs,</HI> which I was told sometimes weighed thirty pounds, but it was not my fortune to see any during my stay in the neighbourhood of that vast water.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="280"/>Trouts (probably of the same species) are also taken in <HI>Hulsewater,</HI> a lake in <HI>Cumberland,</HI> of a much su∣perior size to those of <HI>Lough Neagh.</HI> These are sup∣posed to be the same with the trout of the lake of of <HI>Geneva,</HI> a fish I have eaten more than once, and think but a very indifferent one.</P>
<P>In the river <HI>Eynion,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Crooked trouts.</NOTE> not far from <HI>Machyntleth,</HI> in <HI>Merionethshire,</HI> and in one of the <HI>Snowdon</HI> lakes, are found a variety of trout, which are naturally de∣formed, having a strange crookedness near the tail, resembling that of the perch before described. We dwell the less on these monstrous productions, as our friend the Hon. <HI>Daines Barrington,</HI> has already given an account of them in an ingenious differtation on some of the <HI>Cambrian</HI> fish, published in the <HI>Philo∣sophical Transactions</HI> of the year 1767.</P>
<P>Trouts are most voracious fish, and afford excel∣lent diversion to the angler: the passion for the sport of angling is so strong in the neighborhood of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> that the liberty of fishing in some of the streams in the adjacent counties, is purchased at the rate of ten pounds per annum.</P>
<P>These fish shift their quarters to spawn, and, like salmon, make up towards the heads of rivers to de∣posit their roes. The under jaw of the trout is sub∣ject, at certain times, to the same curvature as that of the salmon.</P>
<P>A trout taken in <HI>Llynallet,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Descr.</NOTE> in <HI>Denbighshire,</HI> which is famous for an excellent kind, measured seventeen inches, its depth three and three quarters, its weight one pound ten ounces: the head thick, the nose ra∣ther sharp: the upper jaw a little longer than the
<PB N="253" REF="281"/>lower; both jaws, as well as the head, were of a pale brown, blotched with black: the teeth sharp and strong, disposed in the jaws, roof of the mouth and tongue, as is the case with the whole genus, ex∣cept the <HI>Gwyniad,</HI> which is toothless, and the <HI>Gray∣ling,</HI> which has none on its tongue.</P>
<P>The back was dusky; the sides tinged with a purplish bloom, marked with deep purple spots, mixed with black, above and below the side line which was strait: the belly white.</P>
<P>The first dorsal fin was spotted; the spurious fin brown, tipped with red; the pectoral, ventral, and anal fins, of a pale brown; the edges of the anal fin white: the tail very little forked when ex∣tended.</P>

<P>THE samlet is the lest of the trout kind, is frequent in the <HI>Wye,</HI> in the upper part of the <HI>Severn,</HI> and the rivers that run into it, in the north of <HI>England,</HI> and in <HI>Wales.</HI> It is by several imagined to be the fry of the salmon; but our reasons for dissenting from that opinion are these:
<LIST>
<ITEM>First, It is well known that the salmon fry never
<PB N="254" REF="282"/>continue in the fresh waters the whole year; but as numerous as they appear on their first escape from the spawn, all vanish on the first vernal flood that happens, which sweeps them into the sea, and leaves scarce one behind.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Secondly, The growth of the salmon fry is so quick and so considerable, as suddenly to exceed the bulk of the largest samlet: for example, the fry that have quitted the fresh water in the spring, not larger than gudgeons, return into it again a foot or more in length.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Thirdly, The salmon attain a considerable bulk before they begin to breed: the samlets, on the contrary, are found male and female <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It has been vulgarly imagined, that there were no other than males of this species.</NOTE>, (dstinguished by the milt and roe) of their common size.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Fourthly, They are found in the fresh waters in all times of the year, and even at seasons when the salmon fry have gained a considerable size. It is well known, that near <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> (where they are called <HI>Samsons</HI>) they are found in such quantities in the month of <HI>September,</HI> that a skilful angler, in a coracle, will take with a fly from twelve to sixteen dozen in a day.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>They spawn in <HI>November</HI> and <HI>December,</HI> at which time those of the <HI>Severn</HI> push up towards the head of that fair river, quitting the lesser brooks, and re∣turn into them again when they have done.</P>
<P>They have a general resemblance to the trout, therefore must be described comparatively.</P>
<LIST>
<PB N="255" REF="283"/>
<ITEM>First, The head is proportionably narrower, and the mouth less than that of the trout.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Secondly, Their body is deeper.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Thirdly, They seldom exceed six or seven inches in length.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Fourthly, The pectoral fins have generally but one large black spot, tho' sometimes a single small one attends it; whereas the pectoral fins of the trout are more numerously marked.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Fifthly, The spurious or fat fin on the back is ne∣ver tipped with red; nor is the edge of the anal fin white.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Sixthly, The spots on the body are fewer, and not so bright. It is also marked from the back to the sides with six or seven large bluish bars; but this is not a certain character, as the same is some∣times found in young trouts.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Seventhly, The tail of the samlet is much more forked than that of the trout.</ITEM>

<P>THE charr is an inhabitant of the lakes of the north, and of those of the mountanous parts of <HI>Europe.</HI> It affects clear and pure waters, and is very rarely known to wander into running streams, except into such whose bottom is similar to the neighboring lake.</P>
<P>It is found in vast abundance in the cold lakes on the summits of the <HI>Lapland Alps,</HI> and is almost the only fish that is met with in any plenty in those re∣gions; where it would be wonderful how they sub∣sisted, had not Provindence supplied them with in∣numerable <HI>larvae</HI> of the <HI>Gnat</HI> kind <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A pupil of <HI>Linnaeus</HI> remarks in the fourth volume of the <HI>Amsen.

<P>There are but few lakes in our island that pro∣duce this fish, and even those not in any abundance. It is found in <HI>Winander Mere</HI> in <HI>Westmorland;</HI> in <HI>Llyn Quellyn,</HI> near the foot of <HI>Snowdon;</HI> and before the discovery of the copper-mines, in those of <HI>Llyn∣berris,</HI> but the mineral streams have entirely destroyed the fish in the last lakes <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">They are also found in certain lakes in <HI>Merionethshire.</HI></NOTE> Whether the waters of <HI>Ireland</HI> afford the charr, we are uncertain, but ima∣gine not, except it has been overlooked by their writers on the natural history of that kingdom. In <HI>Scotland</HI> it is found in <HI>Loch Inch,</HI> and other neigh∣boring lakes, and is said to go into the <HI>Spey</HI> to spawn.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="287"/>The largest and most beautiful we ever received were taken in <HI>Winander Mere,</HI> and were communi∣cated to us by the Rev. Mr. <HI>Farrish,</HI> of <HI>Carlisle,</HI> with an account of their natural history. He favored me with five specimens, two under the name of the <HI>Case Charr,</HI> male and female; another he called the <HI>Gelt Charr,</HI> i. e. a charr which had not spawned the preceding season, and on that account is reckoned to be in the greatest perfection. The two others were inscribed, the <HI>Red Charr, the Silver or Gilt Charr,</HI> the <HI>Carpio Lacus</HI> BENACI, <HI>Raii syn. pisc.</HI> 66, which last are in <HI>Westmorland</HI> distinguished by the epithet <HI>red,</HI> by reason of the flesh assuming a higher color than the other when dressed.</P>
<P>On the closest examination, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Varie∣ties.</NOTE> we could not discover any specific differences in these specimens, therefore must describe them as the same fish, subject only to a slight variation in their form, hereafter to be noted. But there is in another respect an essential difference, we mean in their oeconomy, which is in all beings invariable; the particulars we shall deli∣ver in the very words of our obliging informant.</P>
<P>The <HI>Umbla minor,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Spawn∣ing of the case aharr.</NOTE> or case charr, spawns about <HI>Michaelmas,</HI> and chiefly in the river <HI>Brathy,</HI> which uniting with another called the <HI>Rowthay,</HI> about a quarter of a mile above the lake, they both fall into it together. The <HI>Brathy</HI> has a black rocky bottom; the bottom of the <HI>Rowthay</HI> is a bright sand, and into this the charr are never observed to enter. Some of them however spawn in the lake, but always in such parts of it which are stony, and resemble the
<PB N="259" REF="288"/>channel of the <HI>Brathy.</HI> They are supposed to be in the highest perfection about <HI>May,</HI> and continue so all the summer, yet are rarely caught after <HI>April.</HI> When they are spawning in the river they will take a bait, but at no other time, being commonly taken, as well as the other species, in what they call <HI>breast nets,</HI> which are in length about twenty-four fathoms, and about five, where broadest.</P>
<P>The season which the other species spawns in is from the beginning of <HI>January</HI> to the end of <HI>March.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gilt charr.</NOTE> They are never known to ascend the rivers, but al∣ways in those parts of the lake which are springy, where the bottom is smooth and sandy, and the water warmest. The fishermen judge of this warmth, by observing that the water seldom freezes in the places where they spawn, except in intense frosts, and then the ice is thinner than in other parts of the lake. They are taken in greatest plenty from the end of <HI>September</HI> to the end of <HI>November:</HI> at other times they are hardly to be met with. This species is much more esteemed for the table than the other, and is very delicate when potted.</P>
<P>We must observe, that this account of the spawn∣ing season of the <HI>Westmorland</HI> charrs, agrees very nearly with that of those of <HI>Wales,</HI> the last appear∣ing about a month later, keep moving from side to side of the pool, and then retire into the deep wa∣ter, where they are sometimes but rarely taken.</P>
<P>This remarkable circumstance of the different season of spawning in fish, apparently the same (for the red charr of <HI>Winander,</HI> is certainly not the
<PB N="260" REF="289"/><HI>Carpio Lacus</HI> BENACI <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A fish well described by <HI>Salvianus, p.</HI> 99, which bears no kind of resemblance to our fish, except the generical one.</NOTE>) puzzles us greatly, and makes us wish that the curious, who border on that lake, would pay farther attention to the natural history of these fish, and favor us with some further lights on the subject.</P>
<P>We shall now describe the varieties by the names ascribed to them in the north.</P>
<P>The length of the red charr to the division in its tail, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Red charr.</NOTE> was twelve inches; its biggest circumference almost seven. The first dorsal fin five inches and three quarters from the tip of its nose, and consisted of twelve branched rays; the first of which was short, the fifth the longest: the fat fin was very small.</P>
<P>Each of the five fish had double nostrils, and small teeth in the jaws, roof of the mouth, and on the tongue.</P>
<P>The head, back, dorsal fin, and tail of each, was of a dusky blue; the sides rather paler, marked with numbers of bright red spots: the bellies of the <HI>Red Charr</HI> were of a full and rich red; those of the <HI>Case Charr</HI> rather paler; from this particular the <HI>Welch</HI> call these fish <HI>Torgoch,</HI> or red belly.</P>
<P>The first rays of the anal and ventral fins of each, were of a pure white; the rest of each fin on the lower part of the body, tinged with red.</P>
<P>The lateral line strait, dividing the fish in two equal parts, or nearly so.</P>
<P>The jaws in the <HI>Case Charr</HI> are perfectly even; on the contrary, those of the <HI>Red Charr</HI> were unequal,
<PB N="261" REF="290"/>the upper jaw being the broadest, and the teeth hung over the lower, as might be perceived on passing the finger over them.</P>
<P>The branchiostegous rays were, on different sides of the same fish, unequal in number, viz. 12,—11, 11,—10, 10—9, except in one, where they were 11,—11.</P>
<P>The <HI>Gelt,</HI> or <HI>Barren Charr,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gelt charr.</NOTE> was rather more slender than the others, as being without spawn. The back of a glossy dusky blue: the sides filvery, mixed with blue, spotted with pale red: the sides of the belly were of a pale red, the bottom white.</P>
<P>The tails of each bifurcated.</P>
<P>The charrs we have seen, brought from the <HI>Snow∣don</HI> lakes, were rather smaller than those of <HI>West∣morland:</HI> their colors paler. The supposed males very much resemble the <HI>Gelt Charr;</HI> but that is not a cer∣tain distinction of sex, for the Rev. Mr. <HI>Far∣rington,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Who favored the Royal Society with a paper on the <HI>Welch</HI> charr. <HI>Vide Phil.

<P>THE smelt inhabits the seas of the northern parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> and we believe never is found as far south as the <HI>Mediterranean:</HI> the <HI>Seine</HI> is one of the <HI>French</HI> rivers which receive it, but whether it is found south of that, we have not at present authority to say. If we can depend on the obser∣vations of navigators, who generally have too much to think of to attend to the <HI>minutiae</HI> of natural his∣tory, these fish are taken in the straits of <HI>Magel∣lan,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Narborough's Voy. <HI>123.</HI></NOTE> and of a most surprising size, some measuring twenty inches in length, and eight in circumference.</P>
<P>They inhabit the seas that wash these islands the whole year, and never go very remote from shore, except when they ascend the rivers. It is remarked in certain rivers that they appear a long time before they spawn, being taken in great abundance in <HI>No∣vember, December,</HI> and <HI>January,</HI> in the <HI>Thames</HI> and <HI>Dee,</HI> but in others not till <HI>February,</HI> and in <HI>March</HI>
<PB N="265" REF="294"/>and <HI>April</HI> they spawn; after which <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the river <HI>Conway,</HI> near <HI>Llanrwst,</HI> and in the <HI>Mersey</HI> they never continue above three or four weeks.</NOTE> they all return to the salt water, and are not seen in the rivers till the next season. It has been observed, that they never come into the <HI>Mersey</HI> as long as there is any snow water in the river.</P>
<P>These fish vary greatly in size, but the largest we ever heard of was thirteen inches long, and weighed half a pound.</P>
<P>They have a very particular scent, from whence is derived one of their <HI>English</HI> names <HI>Smelt,</HI> i. e. smell it. That of <HI>Sparling,</HI> which is used in <HI>Wales,</HI> and the north of <HI>England,</HI> is taken from the <HI>French Eperlan.</HI> There is a wonderful disagreement in the opinion of people in respect to the scent of this fish; some assert it flavors of the violet; the <HI>Germans,</HI> for a very different reason, distinguish it by the elegant title of <HI>Stinckfisch.</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">And not without reason, if we may depend on <HI>Linnaeus,</HI> who says there are in the <HI>Baltic</HI> two varieties, the one, which is called <HI>Nors, faetidissimus, stercoris instar,</HI> which in the early spring, when the peasants come to buy it, fills all the streets of <HI>Upsal</HI> with the smell.

<P>The irides are silvery: the pupil of a full black: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Descr.</NOTE> the under jaw is the longest: in the front of the up∣per jaw are four large teeth; those in the sides of both are small; in the roof of the mouth are two
<PB N="266" REF="295"/>rows of teeth; on the tongue two others of large teeth.</P>
<P>The first dorsal fin has eleven rays; the pectoral fins the same number; the ventral eight; the anal fourteen.</P>
<P>The scales are small, and readily drop off: the tail consists of nineteen rays, and is forked.</P>
<P>The color of the back is whitish, with a cast of green, beneath which it is varied with blue, and then succeeds a beautiful gloss of a silvery hue.</P>
<P>Besides this species is another, <NOTE PLACE="marg">South∣ampton <HI>smelt.</HI></NOTE> which was commu∣nicated to us by the Hon. <HI>Daines Barrington,</HI> who describes it in these words:</P>
<P>The <HI>Southampton</HI> smelt agrees with the common kind in having two back fins, but both of them are radiated; the first with eight radii, the second with twelve; the belly fins have only five or six radii: the upper jaw is longer than the lower, and has a few teeth, whereas the lower has none: in color, transparency of the back and head, silver stripes on the sides, forked tail, &amp;c. it agrees nearly with the former, but has nothing of the violet smell or taste. It swarms in that sea, and is the common bait for whiting, mackrell, flat-fish, &amp;c. It is eaten fried, is tender and sweet, and without any small bones, but must be gutted before it is dressed. It grows to three or four inches in length, but is com∣monly much less.</P>

<P>It is a gregarious fish, and approaches the shores in vast shoals in spring and in summer, which prove in many places a blessed relief to the poor of inland countries, in the same degree as the annual return of the herring is to those who inhabit the coasts. The Rev. Mr. <HI>Farrish,</HI> of <HI>Carlisle,</HI> wrote me word, that he was assured by a <HI>Hulse-water</HI> fisherman, that last summer he took between seven and eight thousand at one draught.

<P>The <HI>Gwiniad</HI> is a fish of an insipid taste, and must be eaten soon, for it will not keep long; those that choose to preserve them do it with salt. They die very soon after they are taken. Their spawning sea∣son in <HI>Llyntegid</HI> is in <HI>December.</HI></P>

<P>THE pike is common in most of the lakes of <HI>Europe,</HI> but the largest are those taken in <HI>Lapland,</HI> which, according to <HI>Schaeffer,</HI> are some∣times eight feet long. They are taken there in great abundance, dried, and exported for sale. The largest fish of this kind which we ever heard of in <HI>England,</HI> weighed thirty-five pounds.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="301"/>All writers who treat of this species bring in∣stances of its vast voraciousness. We have known one that was choaked by attempting to swallow one of its own species that proved too large a morsel. It does not confine itself to feed on fish and frogs; it will devour the water rat, and draw down the young ducks as they are swimming about. In a manuscript note which we found, p. 244, of our copy of <HI>Plott</HI>'s History of <HI>Staffordshire,</HI> is the fol∣lowing extraordinary fact: <Q>At Lord <HI>Gower</HI>'s ca∣nal at <HI>Trentham,</HI> a pike seized the head of a swan as she was feeding under water, and gorged so much of it as killed them both. The servants perceiving the swan with its head under water for a longer time than usual, took the boat, and found both swan and pike dead <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This note we afterwards discovered was wrote by Mr. <HI>Plott,</HI> of <HI>Oxford,</HI> who assured me he inserted it on good au∣thority.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>But there are instances of its fierceness still more surprizing, and which indeed border a little on the marvellous. <HI>Gesner</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Gesner pisc. <HI>503.</HI></NOTE> relates, that a famished pike in the <HI>Rhone</HI> seized on the lips of a mule that was brought to water, and that the beast drew the fish out before it could disengage itself. That people have been bit by these voracious creatures while they were washing their legs, and that they will even con∣tend with the otter for its prey, and endeavour to force it out of its mouth <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Walton. <HI>157.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>Small fish shew the same uneasiness and detesta∣tion at the presence of this tyrant, as the little
<PB N="272" REF="302"/>birds do at the sight of the hawk or owl. When the pike lies dormant near the surface (as is fre∣quently the case) the lesser fish are often observed to swim around it in vast numbers, and in great an∣xiety. Pike are often haltered in a noose, and taken while they lie thus asleep, as they are often found in the ditches near the <HI>Thames</HI> in the month of <HI>May.</HI></P>
<P>In the shallow water of the <HI>Lincolnshire</HI> fens they are frequently taken in a manner peculiar, we be∣lieve, to that county, and the isle of <HI>Ceylon</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Knox'<HI>s</HI> Hist. Ceylon, <HI>28.</HI></NOTE>. The fishermen makes use of what is called a crown-net, which is no more than a hemispherical basket, open at top and bottom. He stands at the end of one of the little fen-boats, and frequently puts his basket down to the bottom of the water, then poking a stick into it, discovers whether he has any booty by the striking of the fish; and vast numbers of pike are taken in this manner.</P>
<P>The longevity of this fish is very remarkable, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Longevi∣ty.</NOTE> if we may credit the accounts given of it. <HI>Rzaczyn∣ski</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Hist. Nat. Poloniae, <HI>152.</HI></NOTE> tells us of one that was ninety years old; but <HI>Gesner</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Iconos piscium,</HI> 316, where a print of the ring is given.</NOTE> relates, that in the year 1497, a pike was taken near <HI>Hailbrun,</HI> in <HI>Suabia,</HI> with a brazen ring affixed to it, on which were those words in <HI>Greek</HI> characters: <HI>I am the fish which was first of all put into this lake by the hands of the governor of the uni∣verse,</HI> FREDERICK <HI>the Second, the 5th of</HI> October, 1230:" so that the former must have been an in∣fant to this <HI>Methusalem</HI> of a fish.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="303"/>Pikes spawn in <HI>March</HI> or <HI>April,</HI> according to the coldness or warmth of the weather. When they are in high season their colors are very fine, being green, spotted with bright yellow; and the gills are of a most vivid and full red. When out of season, the green changes to grey, and the yellow spots turn pale.</P>
<P>The head is very flat; the upper jaw broad, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Descr.</NOTE> and is shorter than the lower: the under jaw turns up a little at the end, and is marked with minute punctures.</P>
<P>The teeth are very sharp, disposed only in the front of the upper jaw, but in both sides of the lower, in the roof of the mouth, and often the tongue. The slit of the mouth, or the gape, is very wide; the eyes small.</P>
<P>The dorsal fin is placed very low on the back, and consists of twenty-one rays; the pectoral of fifteen; the ventral of eleven; the anal of eighteen.</P>
<P>The tail is bifurcated.</P>

<P>THIS fish which is known in many places, is known by the name of the <HI>Sea Needle.</HI> It comes in shoals on our coasts in the beginning of summer, and precedes the mackrel: it has a resem∣blance to it in taste, but the light green, which stains the back bone of this fish when boiled, gives many people a disgust to it.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Ray</HI> tells us, that when he was in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> the fishermen gave him the names of two species of this fish, one they called <HI>Girrocks,</HI> the other <HI>Skippers;</HI> these we may suppose to be the common kind, the other (according to Mr. <HI>Jago</HI>'s conjecture) is pro∣bably the same with the <HI>Saurus</HI> of <HI>Rondeletius,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Saurus.</NOTE> p. 232, which both those icthyologists agree has a shor∣ter nose than the common species. We have no other description of this fish than what is left us by <HI>Ron∣deletius,</HI> who says, that it is shorter and thicker than the other; that the nose is shorter and turns up; that
<PB N="275" REF="305"/>the edges of the jaws are serrated; and that between the anal fin and the tail it has several spurious fins like the mackrel. We do not venture to make a distinct article of this fish, because Mr. <HI>Jago</HI> has not pointed out the specific difference; but we thought it necessary to give this brief description of it from <HI>Rondeletius,</HI> to supply that defect in case the <HI>Saurus</HI> should prove a <HI>British</HI> fish.</P>
<P>The common sea pike, or sea needle, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Descr.</NOTE> sometimes grows to the length of three feet, or more.</P>
<P>The jaws are very long, slender, and sharp pointed; the under extends much farther than the upper, and the edges of both are armed with numbers of short slender teeth: the inside of the mouth is purple: the tongue small: the eyes large: the irides silvery: the nostrils wide and round.</P>
<P>The body is slender: the belly quite flat, bounded on both sides by a rough line.</P>
<P>The pectoral fins consist of twelve rays; the ven∣tral fins small, and placed very remote from the head, consists of six rays, the first spiny.</P>
<P>The dorsal fin lies on the very lower part of the back, consists of eighteen rays; the first are high, the others lower as they approach the tail; the anal fin is of the same form, and placed opposite the other: the tail is forked.</P>
<P>The colors are extremely beautiful when the fish is in the water: the back of a fine green, beneath that appears a rich changeable blue and purple: the sides and belly are of a fine silvery hue.</P>

<P>THE mullet is justly ranked by <HI>Aristotle</HI> among the <HI>Pisces Littorales,</HI> or those that prefer the shores to the full sea: they are found in great plenty on several of the sandy coasts of our island, and haunt in particular those small bays that have in∣fluxes of fresh water. They come in great shoals, and keep rooting like hogs in the sand or mud, leaving their traces in form of large round holes. They are very cunning, and when surrounded with a net, the whole shoal frequently escapes by leaping over it, for when one takes the lead, the others are sure to follow: this circumstance is taken notice of by <HI>Oppian;</HI> whether the latter part of his observa∣tion is true, is what we are uncertain.</P>

<P>THE herring was unknown to the antients, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Name.</NOTE> notwithstanding the words <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> are by translators rendered <HI>Helec</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Which word, in spite of all <HI>lexicographers,</HI> never signisied any thing but the <HI>garum</HI> or pickle. <HI>Vide p.</HI> 221.</NOTE>. The charac∣ters given of those fish are common to such num∣bers of different species, as render it impossible to say which they intended.</P>
<P>Herrings are found from the highest northern lati∣tudes yet known, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Place.</NOTE> as low as the northern coasts of <HI>France;</HI> and excepting one instance brought by <HI>Dod</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Natural Hist. of the Herring, p. 27.</NOTE>, of a few being once taken in the Bay of <HI>Tangier,</HI> are never found more southerly.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="315"/>They are met with in vast shoals on the coast of <HI>America,</HI> as low as <HI>Carolina.</HI> In <HI>Chesapeak</HI> Bay is an annual inundation of those fish, which cover the shores in such quantities as to become a nusance <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Catesby Carol. <HI>ii. xxxiii.</HI></NOTE> We find them again in the seas of <HI>Kamtzchatka,</HI> and possibly they reach <HI>Japan;</HI> for <HI>Kaempfer</HI> men∣tions, in his account of the fish of that country, some that are congenerous.</P>
<P>The great winter rendezvous of the herring is within the <HI>Arctic</HI> circle: there they continue for many months in order to recruit themselves after the fatigue of spawning, the seas within that space swarming with insect food, in a degree far greater than in our warmer latitudes.</P>
<P>This mighty army begins to put itself in motion in the spring; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Migra∣tions.</NOTE> we distinguish this vast body by that name, for the word herring is derived from the <HI>Ger∣man, Heer,</HI> an army, to express their numbers.</P>
<P>They begin to appear off the <HI>Shetland</HI> isles in <HI>April</HI> and <HI>May;</HI> these are only forerunners of the grand shoal which comes in <HI>June,</HI> and their appearance is marked by certain signs by the numbers of birds, such as gannets, and others which follow to prey on them: but when the main body approaches, its breadth and its depth is such as to alter the appear∣ance of the very ocean. It is divided into distinct columns of five or six miles in length, and three or four in breadth, and they drive the water before them with a kind of rippling: sometimes they slink for the space of ten or fifteen minutes, then rise
<PB N="286" REF="316"/>again to the surface, and in bright weather reflect a variety of splendid colors, like a field of the most pretious gems, in which, or rather in a much more valuable light, should this stupendous gift of Pro∣vidence be considered by the inhabitants of the <HI>Bri∣tish</HI> isles.</P>
<P>The first check this army meets in its march south∣ward, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Separa∣tion.</NOTE> is from the <HI>Shetland</HI> isles, which divide it in∣to two parts; one wing takes to the east, the other to the western shores of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and fill every bay and creek with their numbers; others pass on towards <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> the great and antient mart of herrings; they then pass thro' the <HI>British</HI> channel, and after that in a manner disappear. Those which take to the west, after offering themselves to the <HI>He∣brides,</HI> where the great stationary fishery is, proceed towards the north of <HI>Ireland,</HI> where they meet with a second interruption, and are obliged to make a se∣cond division; the one takes to the western side, and is scarce perceived, being soon lost in the im∣mensity of the <HI>Atlantic;</HI> but the other, which passes into the <HI>Irish</HI> sea, rejoices and feeds the inhabi∣tants of most of the coasts that border on it.</P>
<P>These brigades, as we may call them, which are thus separated from the greater columns, are often capricious in their motions, and do not shew an in∣variable attachment to their haunts. We have had in our time instances of their entirely quitting the coasts of <HI>Cardiganshire,</HI> and visiting those of <HI>Caer∣narvonshire</HI> and <HI>Flintshire,</HI> where they continued for a few years, but in the present year have quite de∣serted our sea, and returned to their old seats. The
<PB N="287" REF="317"/>season of their appearance among us was very late, never before the latter end of <HI>November:</HI> their con∣tinuance till <HI>February.</HI></P>
<P>Were we inclined to consider this partial migra∣tion of the herring in a moral light, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Provi∣dential instinct.</NOTE> we might re∣flect with veneration and awe on the mighty Power which originally impressed on this most useful body of his creatures, the instinct that directs and points out the course, that blesses and enriches these islands, which causes them at certain and invariable times to quit the vast polar deeps, and offer them∣selves to our expecting fleets. That benevolent Be∣ing has never, from the earliest records, been once known to withdraw this blessing from the whole, tho' he often thinks proper to deny it to particulars; yet this partial failure (for which we see no natural reason) should fill us with the most exalted and grareful sense of his Providence, for impressing so invariable and general instinct on these fish towards a southward migration, when the whole is to be be∣nefited, and to withdraw it only when a minute part is to suffer.</P>
<P>This instinct was given them, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Spawa∣ing.</NOTE> that they might re∣move for the sake of depositing their spawn in warm∣er seas, that would mature and vivify it more as∣suredly than those of the frigid zone. It is not from defect of food that they set themselves in motion, for they come to us full and fat, and on their return are almost universally observed to be lean and mi∣serable. What their food is near the pole, we are not yet informed; but in our seas they feed much on the <HI>Oniscus Marinus,</HI> a crustaceous insect, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Food.</NOTE> and sometimes on their own fry.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="318"/>They are in full roe the end of <HI>June,</HI> and continue in perfection till the beginning of winter, when they begin to deposit their spawn. The young herrings begin to approach the shores in <HI>July</HI> and <HI>August,</HI> and are then from half an inch to two inches long: those in <HI>Yorkshire</HI> are called <HI>Herring Sile</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Sueaes</HI> and <HI>Danes</HI> call the old herring <HI>Sill;</HI> but the people of <HI>Slesw</HI> from whence the <HI>Anglo-Saxons</HI> came call the fry <HI>Sylen.</HI></NOTE>. Tho' we have no particular authority for it, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Return.</NOTE> yet as very few young herrings are found in our seas during winter, it seems most certain that they must return to their parental haunts beneath the ice, to repair the vast destruction of their race during summer, by men, fowl and fish. Some of the old herrings eontinue on our coasts the whole year: the <HI>Scarborough</HI> fishermen never put down their nets but they catch a few; but the numbers that remain are not worth men∣tion in comparison to the numbers that return.</P>
<P>Herrings vary greatly in size. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Descr.</NOTE> Mr. <HI>Travis</HI> com∣municated to me the information of an experienced fisher, who informed him that there is sometimes taken near <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> a herring distinguished by a black spot above the nose; and that he once saw one that was twenty-one inches and an half long. He insisted that it was a different species, and va∣ried as much from the common herring as that does from the pilchard. This we mention in order to incite some curious person on that coast to a far∣ther enquiry.</P>
<P>The eye is very large: the edges of the upper jaw and the tongue are very rough, but the whole mouth
<PB N="289" REF="319"/>is void of teeth: the gill covers are very loose, and open very wide; which occasions the almost instant death of the herring when taken out of the water, which is well known, even to a proverb.</P>
<P>The dorsal fin consists of about seventeen rays, and is placed beyond the centre of gravity, so that when the fish is suspended by it, the head immediately dips down: the two ventral fins have nine rays; the pectoral seventeen; the anal fourteen: the tail is much forked.</P>
<P>The lateral line is not apparent, unless the scales are taken off: the sides are compressed: the belly sharply carinated, but the ridge quite smooth, and not in the lest serrated.</P>
<P>The scales are large, thin, and fall off with a slight touch.</P>
<P>The color of the back and sides green, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Color.</NOTE> varied with blue: the belly silvery.</P>
<P>The herring fishery is of great antiquity: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fishery.</NOTE> the in∣dustrious <HI>Dutch</HI> first engaged in it about the year 1164: they were in possession of it for several cen∣turies, but at length its value become so justly to be known, that it gave rise to most obstinate and well-disputed wars between the <HI>English</HI> and them; but still their diligence and skill gives them a superiority over us in that branch of trade.</P>
<P>Our great stations are off the <HI>Shetland</HI> and <HI>Western Isles,</HI> and off the coast of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> in which the <HI>Dutch</HI> also share. <HI>Yarmouth</HI> has long been famous for its herring fair <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This fair was regulated by an act, commonly called the <HI>Sta∣tute of Herrings,</HI> in the 31st year of <HI>Edward</HI> III.</NOTE>; that town is obliged, by its
<PB N="290" REF="320"/>charter, to send to the sheriffs of <HI>Norwich</HI> one hun∣dred herrings, to be made into twenty-four pies, by them to be delivered to the lord of the manor of <HI>East Carleton,</HI> who is to convey them to the king <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cambden Britan.</HI> I. 458.</NOTE> The facetious Doctor <HI>Fuller</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">British Worthies. <HI>238.</HI></NOTE> takes notice of the great repute the county of <HI>Norfolk</HI> was in for this fish, and, with his usual archness, calls a red her∣ring a <HI>Norfolk Capon.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> are most extravagantly fond of this fish when it is pickled. A premium is given to the first buss that arrives in <HI>Holland</HI> with a lading of this their <HI>ambrosia,</HI> and a vast price given for each keg. We have been in the country at that happy minute, and observed as much joy among the inha∣bitants on its arrival, as the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> shew on the first overflowing of the <HI>Nile. Flanders</HI> had the honor of inventing the art of pickling herrings. One <HI>William Beukelen,</HI> of <HI>Biervlet,</HI> near <HI>Sluys,</HI> hit on this useful expedient: from him was derived the name <HI>pickle,</HI> which we borrow from the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>German.</HI> It is very singular that most nations give the name of their favorite dish to the facetious atten∣dant on every mountebank. Thus the <HI>Dutch</HI> call him PICKLE HERRING; the <HI>Italians,</HI> MACARONI; the <HI>French,</HI> JEAN POTTAGE; the <HI>Germans,</HI> HANS WURST <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">That is, <HI>Jack Sausage.</HI></NOTE>; and we dignify him with the title of JACK PUDDING.</P>

<P>THE pilchard appears in vast shoals off the <HI>Cornish</HI> coasts, about the middle of <HI>July,</HI> dis∣appear the beginning of winter, yet sometimes a few return again after <HI>Christmas.</HI> Their winter re∣treat is the same with that of the herring, and their motives for migrating the same.

<P>The approach of the pilchard is known by much the same signs as those that indicate the arrival of the herring. Persons, called in <HI>Cornwall Huers,</HI> are placed on the cliffs, to point to the boats stationed off the land the course of the fish.

<P>The emoluments that accrue to the inhabitants of that county are great, and are best expressed in the words of Doctor <HI>W. Borlase,</HI> in his account of the <HI>Pilchard</HI> fishery.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="322"/><Q>It employs a great number of men on the sea, training them thereby to naval affairs; employs men, women, and children, at land, in salting, pressing, washing, and cleaning, in making boats, nets, ropes, casks, and all the trades de∣pending on their construction and sale. The poor is fed with the offals of the captures, the land with the refuse of the fish and salt, the mer∣chant finds the gains of commission and honest commerce, the fisherman the gains of the fish. Ships are often freighted hither with salt, and into foreign countries with the fish, carrying off at the same time part of our tin. The usual produce of the number of hogsheads exported each year, for ten years, from 1747 to 1756 in∣clusive, from the four ports of <HI>Fawy, Falmouth, Penzance,</HI> and <HI>St. Ives,</HI> it appears that <HI>Fawy</HI> has exported yearly 1732 hogsheads; <HI>Falmouth,</HI> 14631 hogsheads and two-thirds; <HI>Penzance</HI> and <HI>Mounts-Bay,</HI> 12149 hogsheads and one-third; <HI>St. Ives,</HI> 1282 hogsheads: in all amounting to 29795 hogsheads. Every hogshead for ten years last past, together with the bounty allowed for each hogshead exported, and the oil made out of each hogshead, has amounted, one year with another at an average, to the price of one pound thirteen shillings and three-pence; so that the cash paid for pilchards exported has, at a medium, annually amounted to the sum of forty-nine thou∣sand five hundred and thirty-two pounds ten shillings.</Q></P>

<P><PB N="293" REF="324"/>The numbers that are taken at one shooting out of the nets, is amazingly great.

<P>This fish has a general likeness to the herring, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Descr.</NOTE> but differs in some particulars very essentially; we therefore describe it comparatively with the other, having one of each species before us, both of them of the same length, <HI>viz.</HI> nine inches and an half.</P>
<P>The body of the pilchard is less compressed than that of the herring, being thicker and rounder: the nose is shorter in proportion, and turns up: the un∣der jaw is shorter.</P>
<P>The back is more elevated: the belly less sharp: the dorsal fin of the pilchard is placed exactly in the centre of gravity, so that when taken up by it, the body preserves an equilibrium, whereas that of the herring dips at the head: the dorsal fin of the pil∣chard we examined, being placed only three inches eight tenths from the tip of the nose; that of the herring four inches one tenth.</P>
<P>The scales of the pilchard adhere very closely, whereas those of the herring very easily drop off.</P>

<P>MR. <HI>Willoughby</HI> and Mr. <HI>Ray</HI> were of opinion, that these fish were the fry of the herring: we are induced to dissent from them, not only because on comparing a sprat and young herring of equal size, we discovered some specific differences, but likewise for another reason: the former visits our coasts, and continue with us in shoals innumerable, when the others in general have retired to the great northern deeps.</P>
<P>They come into the river <HI>Thames,</HI> below bridge, the beginning of <HI>November,</HI> and leave it in <HI>March,</HI> and are, during their season, a great relief to the poor of the capital.</P>
<P>At <HI>Gravesend,</HI> and at <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> they are cured like red herrings; they are sometimes pickled, and are little inferior in flavor to the <HI>Anchovy,</HI> but the bones will not dissolve like those of the latter.

<P>NEITHER <HI>Aristotle, Athenaeus,</HI> nor <HI>Oppian,</HI> have described their <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> with such preci∣sion, as to induce us to translate it the <HI>Shad,</HI> without affixing to it our sceptic mark. <HI>Ausonius</HI> has been
<PB N="297" REF="328"/>equally negligent in respect to his <HI>Alausa:</HI> all he tells us is, that it was a very bad fish:</P>

<Q><L><HI>Alausae</HI> crackling on the embers are</L>
<L>Of wretched poverty, th'insipid fare.</L></Q>
<P>But commentators have agreed to render the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> of the first, and the <HI>Alausa</HI> of the last, by the word <HI>Shad.</HI> Perhaps they were directed by the authority of <HI>Strabo,</HI> who mentions the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> the supposed <HI>Shad,</HI> and the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <HI>Mullet,</HI> as fish that ascend the <HI>Nile</HI> at certain seasons, which, with the <HI>Dolphin</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is the <HI>Dolphin</HI> of the <HI>Nile,</HI> a fish now unknown to us. <HI>Pliny lib.</HI> viii. <HI>c.</HI> 25. says, it had a sharp sin on its back, with which it destroyed the crocodile, by thrusting it into the belly of that animal, the only penetrable place.</NOTE> of that river, he says, are the only kinds that venture up from the sea for fear of the croco∣dile. That the two first are fish of passage in the <HI>Nile,</HI> is confirmed to us by <HI>Belonius</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Belon. Itin. <HI>98.</HI></NOTE>, and by <HI>Hasselquist</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>P.</HI> 385. 388. <HI>Suedish</HI> edition.</NOTE>. The last says it is found in the <HI>Medi∣terranean</HI> near <HI>Smyrna,</HI> and on the coast of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> near <HI>Rosetto;</HI> and that in the months of <HI>December</HI> and <HI>January</HI> it ascends the <HI>Nile,</HI> as high as <HI>Cairo:</HI> that it is stuffed with pot marjoram, and when dressed in that manner will very nearly intoxicate the eater.</P>
<P>In <HI>Great Britain</HI> the <HI>Severn</HI> affords this fish in higher perfection than any other river. It makes its first appearance there in <HI>May,</HI> but in very warm sea∣sons in <HI>April;</HI> for its arrival, sooner or later, de∣pends much on the temper of the air. It continues
<PB N="298" REF="329"/>in the river about two months, and then is succeeded by a variety which we shall have occasion to men∣tion hereafter.</P>
<P>The <HI>Severn</HI> shad is esteemed a very delicate fish about the time of its first appearance, especially in that part of the river that flows by <HI>Gloucester,</HI> where they are taken in nets, and usually sell dearer than salmon: some are sent to <HI>London,</HI> where the fishmon∣gers distinguish them from those of the <HI>Thames,</HI> by the <HI>French</HI> name of <HI>Alose.</HI></P>
<P>Whether they spawn in this river and the <HI>Wye</HI> is not determined, for their fry has not yet been ascer∣tained. The old fish come from the sea into the river in full roe. In the months of <HI>July</HI> and <HI>August,</HI> multitudes of bleak frequent the river near <HI>Glou∣cester;</HI> some of them are as big as a small herring, and these the fishermen erroneously suspect to be the fry of the shad. Numbers of these are taken near <HI>Gloucester</HI> in those months only, but none of the emaciated shad are ever caught in their return <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Belon</HI> also observes, that none are taken in their return on <HI>tes prend en moutant contre les rivieres, et jamais en descendant.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>The <HI>Thames</HI> shad does not frequent that river till the month of <HI>July,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Twaite.</NOTE> and is esteemed a very insipid coarse fish. About the same time, and rather earlier, the variety called near <HI>Gloucester</HI> the <HI>Twaite,</HI> makes its appearance, and is taken in great numbers in the <HI>Severn,</HI> and is held in as great disrepute as the shad of the <HI>Thames.</HI> The differences between each va∣riety are as follow: The true <HI>Shad</HI> weighs sometimes eight pounds, but their general size is from four to five.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="330"/>The <HI>Twaite,</HI> on the contrary, weighs from half a pound to two pounds, which it never exceeds.</P>
<P>The twaite differs from a small shad only in hav∣ing one or more round black spots on the sides; if only one, it is always near the gill, but commonly there are three or four, placed one under the other <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I must here acknowlege my obligations to Doctor <HI>Lysons,</HI> of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> for his communications relating to this fish, as well as to several other articles relating to those of the <HI>Severn.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>The other particulars agree in each so exactly, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Descr.</NOTE> that the same description will serve for both.</P>
<P>The head slopes down considerably from the back, which at the beginning is very convex, and rather sharp: the body from thence grows gradu∣ally less to the tail.</P>
<P>The under jaw is rather longer than the upper: the teeth very minute.</P>
<P>The dorsal fin is placed very near the centre, is small, and the middle rays are the longest: the pec∣toral and ventral fins are small: the tail vastly fork∣ed: the belly extremely sharp, and most strongly serrated.</P>
<P>The back is of a dusky blue: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Color.</NOTE> above the gills begins a line of dark spots, which mark the upper part of the back on each side; the number of these spots is uncertain in different fish, from four to ten.</P>
<P>The sides and belly are silvery.</P>

<P>THIS is one of the naturalized fish of our country, having been introduced here by <HI>Leo∣nard Mascal,</HI> about the year 1514 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fuller's British Worthies, Sussex. <HI>113.</HI></NOTE>, to whom we were also indebted for that excellent apple the <HI>pepin.</HI> The many good things that our island wanted be∣fore that period, are enumerated in this old distich:
<Q><L>Turkies, carps, hops, pickerel, and beer,</L>
<L>Came into <HI>England</HI> all in one year.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="332"/>As to the two last articles we have some doubts, the others we believe to be true. <HI>Russia</HI> wants these fish at this day; <HI>Sueden</HI> has them only in the ponds of the people of fashion; <HI>Polish Prussia</HI> is the chief seat of the carp; they abound in the rivers and lakes of that country, particularly in the <HI>Frisch</HI> and <HI>Curisch-haff,</HI> where they are taken of a vast size. They are there a great article of commerce, and sent in well-boats to <HI>Sueden</HI> and <HI>Russia.</HI> The mer∣chants purchase them out of the waters of the <HI>no∣blesse</HI> of the country, who draw a good revenue from this article. Neither are there wanting among our gentry, instances of some who make good profit of their ponds.</P>
<P>The antients do not separate the carp from the sea fish. We are credibly informed that they are sometimes found in the harbor of <HI>Dantzick,</HI> between the town and a small place called <HI>Hela.</HI></P>
<P>Carp are very long lived. <HI>Gesner</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gesner pisc. <HI>312.</HI></NOTE> brings an in∣stance of one that was an hundred years old. They also grow to a very great size. On our own know∣lege we can speak of none that exceeded twenty pounds in weight; but <HI>Jovius</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">De piscibus Romanis. <HI>131.</HI></NOTE> says, that they were sometimes taken in the <HI>Lacus Larius</HI> (the <HI>Lago di Como)</HI> of two hundred pounds weight; and <HI>Rzaczynski</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hist. Nat. Poloniae. <HI>142.</HI></NOTE>, mentions others taken in the <HI>Dniester</HI> that were five feet in length.</P>
<P>They are also extremely tenacious of life, and will live for a most remarkable time out of water.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="333"/>An experiment has been made by placing a carp in a net, well wrapped up in wet moss, the mouth only remaining out, and then hung up in a cellar, or some cool place: the fish is frequently fed with white bread and milk, and is besides often plunged into water. Carp thus managed have been known, not only to have lived above a fortnight, but to grow exceedingly fat, and far superior in taste to those that are immediately killed from the pond <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was told me by a gentleman of the utmost veracity, who had twice made the experiment. The same fact is related by that pious Philosopher Doctor <HI>Derham,</HI> in his <HI>Physico-Theology,</HI> edit. 9th. 1737. <HI>ch.</HI> i. <HI>p.</HI> 7. <HI>n. e.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>The carp is a prodigious breeder: <NOTE PLACE="foot">Foecun∣dity.</NOTE> its quantity of roe has been sometimes found so great, that when taken out and weighed against the fish itself, the for∣mer has been found to preponderate. We have for∣bore in this work to enter into minute calculations of the numbers each fish may produce. It has al∣ready been most skilfully performed by Mr. <HI>Harmer,</HI> and printed in the <HI>Philosophical Transactions</HI> of the year 1767. We shall, in our Appendix, take the liberty of borrowing such part of his tables of the foecundity of fish, as will demonstrate the kind at∣tention of Providence, towards the preserving so useful a class of animals for the service of its other creatures.</P>
<P>These fish are extremely cunning, and on that ac∣count are by some styled the <HI>river fox.</HI> They will sometimes leap over the nets, and escape that way; at others, will immerse themselves so deep in the mud, as to let the net pass over them. They are
<PB N="303" REF="334"/>also very shy of taking a bait; yet at the spawning time they are so simple, as to suffer themselves to be tickled, handled, and caught by any body that will attempt it.</P>
<P>This fish is apt to mix its milt with the roe of other fish, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Spurious breed.</NOTE> from which is produced a spurious breed: we have seen the offspring of the carp and tench, which bore the greatest resemblance to the first: we have also heard of the same mixture between the carp and bream.</P>
<P>The carp is of a thick shape: the scales very large, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Descr.</NOTE> and when in best season of a fine gilded hue.</P>
<P>The jaws are of equal length; there are two teeth in the jaws, or on the tongue; but at the entrance of the gullet, above and below, are certain bones that act on each other, and comminute the food be∣fore it passes down.</P>
<P>On each side of the mouth is a single beard; above those on each side another, but shorter: the dorsal fin extends far towards the tail, which is a little bi∣furcated; the third ray of the dorsal fin is very strong, and armed with sharp teeth, pointing down∣wards; the third ray of the anal fin is constructed in the same manner.</P>

<P>THIS fish was so extremely coarse, as to be over∣looked by the antients till the time of <HI>Ausa∣nius,</HI> and what he says is no panegyric on it; for he lets us know it loves deep waters, and that when it is grown old it was not absolutely bad.</P>

<P>It frequents the still and deep parts of rivers, and lives in society, rooting like swine with their noses in the soft banks. It is so tame as to suffer itself to be taken with the hand; and people have been known to take numbers by diving for them. In the summer they move about during night in search of food, but towards autumn, and during winter, confine them∣selves to the deepest holes.</P>
<P>They are the worst and coarsest of fresh water fish, and seldom eat but by the poorer sort of people,
<PB N="305" REF="336"/>who sometime boil them with a bit of bacon to give them a relish. The roe is very noxious, affecting those who unwarily eat of it with a nausea, vomiting, purging, and a slight swelling.</P>
<P>It is sometimes found of the length of three feet, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Descr.</NOTE> and eighteen pounds in weight: it is of a long and rounded form: the scales not large.</P>
<P>Its head is smooth: the nostrils placed near the eyes: the mouth is placed below: on each corner is a single beard, and another on each side the nose.</P>
<P>The dorsal fin is armed with a remarkable strong spine, sharply serrated, with which it can inflict a very severe wound on the incautious handler, and even do much damage to the nets.</P>
<P>The pectoral fins are of a pale brown color; the ventral and anal tipped with yellow: the tail a little bifurcated, and of a deep purple: the side line is strait.</P>

<P>That the <HI>Scarus</HI> was not our <HI>Chub,</HI> is very evident; not only because the <HI>Chub</HI> is entirely an inhabitant of fresh waters, but likewise it seems improbable that the <HI>Romans</HI> would give themselves any trouble about the worst of river fish, when they neglected the most delicious kinds; all their attention was di∣rected towards those of the sea: the difficulty of procuring them seems to have been the criterion of their value, as is ever the case with effete luxury.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="345"/>The chub is a very coarse fish and full of bones: it frequents the deep holes of rivers, and during summer commonly lies on the surface, beneath the shade of some tree or bush. It is a very timid fish, sinking to the bottom on the lest alarm, even at the passing of a shadow, but they will soon resume their situation. It feeds on worms, caterpillars, grass∣hoppers, beetles, and other coleopterous insects that happen to fall into the water; and it will even feed on cray-fish. It is the only fish of this genus that will rife to a fly.</P>
<P>This fish takes its name from its head, not only in our own, but in other languages; we call it <HI>Chub,</HI> according to <HI>Skinner,</HI> from the old <HI>English, Cop,</HI> a head; the <HI>French, Testard;</HI> the <HI>Italians, Capitone.</HI></P>
<P>It does not grow to a large size; we have known some that weighed above five pounds, but <HI>Salvianus</HI> speaks of others that were eight or nine pounds in weight.</P>
<P>The body is oblong, rather round, and of a pretty equal thickness the greatest part of the way: the scales are large.</P>
<P>The irides silvery; the cheeks of the same color: the head and back of a deep dusky green: the sides silvery, but in the summer yellow: the belly white: the pectoral fins of a pale yellow: the ventral and anal fins red: the tail a little forked, of a brownish hue, but tinged with blue at the end.</P>

<P>THE taking of these, <HI>Ausonius</HI> lets us know, was the sport of children, ALBURNOS <HI>praedam puerilibus hamis.</HI></P>
<P>They are very common in many of our rivers, and keep together in large shoals. These fish seem at certain seasons to be affected with the vertigo; they tumble about near the surface of the water, and are incapable of swimming far from the place, but in about two hours recover, and disappear. Fish thus affected the <HI>Thames</HI> fishermen call <HI>mad bleaks.</HI></P>
<P>Artificial pearls are made with scales of this fish, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Artifi∣cial pearls.</NOTE> and we think of the dace. They are beat into a fine powder, then diluted with water, and intro∣duced into a thin glass bubble, which is afterwards filled with wax. The <HI>French</HI> were the inventors of this art. Doctor <HI>Lister</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Journey to <HI>Paris,</HI> 142.</NOTE> tells us, that when he was at <HI>Paris,</HI> a certain artist used in one winter thirty hampers full of fish in this manufacture.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="347"/>The bleak seldom exceeds five or six inches in length: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Descr.</NOTE> their body is slender, greatly compressed sideways, not unlike that of the sprat.</P>
<P>The eyes are large: the irides of a pale yellow: the under jaw the longest: the lateral line crooked: the gills silvery: the back green: the sides and belly silvery: the fins pellucid: the scales fall off very easily: the tail much forked.</P>
<P>During the month of <HI>July</HI> those appear in the <HI>Thames,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">White bait.</NOTE> near <HI>Blackwall</HI> and <HI>Greenwich,</HI> innumerable multitudes of small fish, which are known to the <HI>Londoners</HI> by the name of <HI>White Bait.</HI> They are esteemed very delicious when fried with fine flour, and occasion, during the season, a vast resort of the lower order of epicures to the taverns contiguous to the places they are taken at.</P>
<P>There are various conjectures about this species, but all terminate in a supposition that they are the fry of some fish, but few agree to which kind they owe their origin. Some attribute it to the shad, others to the sprat, the smelt, and the bleak. That they neither belong to the shad, nor the sprat, is evident from the number of branchiostegous rays, which in those are eight, in this only three. That they are not the young of smelts is as clear, because they want the <HI>pinna adiposa,</HI> or rayless fin; and that they are not the offspring of the bleak is extremely probable, since we never heard of the white bait being found in any other river, notwithstanding the bleak is very common in several of the <HI>British</HI> streams: but as the white bait bears a greater simi∣larity to this fish than to any other we have men∣tioned,
<PB N="317" REF="348"/>we give it a place here as an appendage to the bleak, rather than form a distinct article of a fish which it is impossible to class with certainty.</P>
<P>It is evident that it is of the carp or <HI>Cyprinus</HI> ge∣nus: it has only three branchiostegous rays, and only one dorsal fin; and in respect to the form of the body is compressed like that of the bleak.</P>
<P>Its usual length is two inches: the under jaw is the longest: the irides silvery, the pupil black: the dorsal fin is placed nearer to the head than to the tail, and consists of about fourteen rays: the side line is strait: the tail forked, the tips black.</P>
<P>The head, sides, and belly are silvery; the back tinged with green.</P>

<P>THESE fish are now quite naturalized in this country, and breed as freely in the open wa∣ters as the common carp.</P>
<P>They were first introduced into <HI>England</HI> about the year 1691, but were not generally known till 1728, when a great number were brought over, and presented first to Sir <HI>Mathew Dekker,</HI> and by him circulated round the neighborhood of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> from whence they have been distributed to most parts of the country.</P>
<P>In <HI>China</HI> the most beautiful kinds are taken in a small lake in the province of <HI>Che-Kyang.</HI> Every person of fashion keeps them for amusement, either in porcellane vessels, or in the small basons that decorate the courts of the <HI>Chinese</HI> houses. The beauty of their colors, and their lively motions, give great entertainment, especially to the ladies, whose pleasures, by reason of the cruel policy of that country, are extremely limited.</P>
<P>In form of the body they bear a great resem∣blance to a carp. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Descr.</NOTE> They have been known in this island to arrive at the length of eight inches; in
<PB N="320" REF="351"/>their native place they are said <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Du Halde, <HI>316.</HI></NOTE> to grow to the size of our largest herring.</P>
<P>The nostrils are tubular, and form sort of ap∣pendages above the nose: the dorsal fin and the tail vary greatly in shape: the tail is naturally bifid, but in many is trifid, and in some even quadrifid: the anal fins are the strongest characters of this spe∣cies, being placed not behind one another like those of other fish, but opposite each other like the ven∣tral fins.</P>
<P>The colors vary greatly; some are marked with a fine blue, with brown, with bright silver; but the general and predominant color is gold of a most amazing splendor; but their colors and form need not be dwelt on, since those who want opportunity of seeing the living fish, may survey them expressed in the most animated manner, in the works of our ingenious and honest friend Mr. <HI>George Edwards.</HI></P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>The late Bishop of <HI>Carlisle</HI> informed me that a tortoise was taken off the coast of <HI>Scarborough</HI> in 1748 or 1749. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tortoise, page <HI>1.</HI></NOTE> It was purchased by a fa∣mily at that time there, and a good deal of company invited to par∣take of it. A gentleman, who was one of the guests, told them it was a <HI>Mediterranean</HI> turtle, and not wholesome: only one of the com∣pany eat of it, and it almost killed him, being seized with a dreadful vomiting and purging.</P>
<P>Since the printing of that article I have been favored with some very curious accounts of this reptile, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Toad, <HI>7.</HI></NOTE> which will give greater light into its natural history than I am capa∣ble of, from a most unphilosophical but invincible aversion to the whole genus. The facts that will appear in the following lines serve to con∣firm my opinion of its being an innoxious animal, and, I hope, will serve to free numbers from a panic that is carried to a degree of infeli∣city,
<PB N="322" REF="353"/>and also to redeem it from a persecution which the unmerited ill∣opinion the world has conceived, perpetually exposes it to.</P>
<P>The gentlemen I am principally indebted to for my informations are <HI>J. Arscott,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of <HI>Tehott,</HI> in <HI>De∣vonshire,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Pitfield,</HI> of <HI>Exe∣ter.</HI> Some of these accounts were addressed to Doctor <HI>Milles,</HI> Dean of <HI>Exeter;</HI> others to the worthy Prelate abovementioned, to whom I owe these and many other agree∣able correspondencies; others again to myself.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Arscott</HI>'s letters give a very ample history of the nature of the toad: they were both addressed to Doctor <HI>Milles,</HI> and both were the result of certain queries I proposed, which the former was so obliging as to give himself the trouble of answering in a most satisfactory manner.</P>
<P>I shall first take the liberty of citing Mr. <HI>Arscott</HI>'s letter of <HI>Sep∣tember</HI> the 23d, 1768, which men∣tions some very curious particulars of this innocent reptile, which, for such a number of years found an asylum, from the good sense of a
<PB N="323" REF="354"/>family which soared above all vul∣gar prejudices.</P>
<Q><P>It would give me the greatest pleasure to be able to inform you of any particulars worthy Mr. <HI>Pennant</HI>'s notice, concerning the toad who lived so many years with us, and was so great a favo∣rite. The greatest curiosity in it was its becoming so remark∣ably tame. It had frequented some steps before the hall-door some years before my acquaint∣ance commenced with it, and had been admired by my father for its size (which was of the largest I ever met with) who constantly payed it a visit every evening. I knew it myself above thirty years, and by con∣stantly feeding it, brought it to be so tame that it always came to the candle, and looked up as if expecting to be taken up and brought upon the table, where I always fed it with insects of all sorts: it was fondest of flesh maggots, which I kept in bran; it would follow them, and when within a proper distance, would fix its eye, and remain motion∣less for near a quarter of a mi∣nute,
<PB N="324" REF="355"/>as if preparing for the stroke, which was an instanta∣neous throwing its tongue at a great distance upon the insect, which stuck to the tip by a gluti∣nous matter: the motion is quick∣er than the eye can follow <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This rapid capture of its prey might give occasion to the report of its fascinating powers. <HI>Linnaeus</HI> says, <HI>Insecta in sauces fascine revocat.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>I always imagined that the root of its tongue was placed in the fore part of its under jaw, and the tip towards its throat, by which the motion must be a half circle; by which, when its tongue recovered its situation, the insect at the tip would be brought to the place of deglutition. I was confirmed in this by never ob∣serving any internal motion in its mouth, excepting one swallow the instant its tongue returned. Pos∣sibly I might be mistaken, for I never dissected one, but contented myself with opening its mouth, and slightly inspecting it.</P>
<P>You may imagine that a toad generally detested (altho' one of the most inoffensive of all ani∣mals) so much taken notice of and befriended, excited the cu∣riosity
<PB N="325" REF="356"/>of all comers to the house, who all desired to see it fed, so that even ladies so far conquered the horrors instilled into them by nurfes, as to desire to see it. This produced innumerable and improbable reports, making it as large as the crown of a hat, &amp;c. &amp;c. This I hope will ac∣count for my not giving you par∣ticulars more worth your notice. When I first read the account in the papers of toads sucking can∣cerous breasts, I did not believe a word of it, not thinking it pos∣sible for them to suck, having no lips to embrace the part, and a tongue so oddly formed; but as the fact is thoroughly verified, I most impatiently long to be fully informed of all particulars re∣lating to it</P></Q>
<P>Notwithstanding these accounts will serve to point out some errors I had adopted, in respect to this reptile in my first sheet, yet it is with much pleasure I lay before the public a more authentic history, collected from Mr. <HI>Arscott</HI>'s second favor; the answer points out my queries, which it is needless to repeat.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="357"/>
<HI>Tehott, Nov.</HI> 1, 1768.</P>
<Q><P>In respect to the queries I shall here give the most satisfactory answers I am capable of.</P>
<P>First, I cannot say how long my father had been acquainted with the toad before I knew it; but when I first was acquainted with it, he used to mention it as the old toad I've known so many years; I can answer for thirty∣six years.</P>
<P>Secondly, No toads that I ever saw appeared in the winter sea∣son. The old toad made its ap∣pearance as soon as the warm wea∣ther came, and I always concluded it retired to some dry bank to repose till the spring. When we new-lay'd the steps I had two holes made in the third step on each, with a hollow of more than a yard long for it, in which I imagine it slept, as it came from thence at its first appearance.</P>
<P>Thirdly, It was seldom pro∣voked: neither that toad (nor the multitudes I have seen tormented with great cruelty) ever shewed the lest desire of revenge, by spitting or emitting any juice from their pimples. Sometimes
<PB N="327" REF="358"/>upon taking it up it would let out a great quantity of clear water, which, as I have often seen it do the same upon the steps when quite quict, was certainly its urine, and no more than a natural evacuation.</P>
<P>Fourthly, A toad has no particu∣lar enmity for the spider; he used to eat five or six with his millepides (which I take to be its chief food) that I generally provided for it, be∣fore I found out that flesh maggots, by their continual motion, was the most tempting bait; but when of∣fered it eat blowing flies and hum∣ble bees that come from the rat∣tailed maggot in gutters, or in short any insect that moved. I imagine if a bee was to be put before a toad, it would certainly eat it to its cost; but as bees are seldom stirring at the same time that toads are, they can seldom come in their way, as they seldom appear after sun-rising, or before sun-set. In the heat of the day they will come to the mouth of their hole, I believe, for air. I once from my parlour window observed a large toad I had in the bank of a bowling-green, about twelve at noon, a very hot day, very busy and active upon the grass; so uncom∣mon
<PB N="328" REF="359"/>an appearance made me go out to see what it was, when I found an innumerable swarm of winged ants had dropped round his hole, which temptation was as irresistible as a turtle would be to a luxurious al∣derman.</P>
<P>Fifthly, Whether our toad ever propagated its species I know not, rather think not, as it always ap∣peared well, and not lessened in bulk, which it must have done, I should think, if it had discharged so large a quantity of spawn as toads generally do. The females that are to propagate in the spring, I imagine, instead of retiring to dry holes, go into the bottom of ponds, and lay torpid amongst the weeds; for to my great surprize in the middle of the winter, having for amusement put a long pole into my pond, and twisted it till it had gathered a large volume of weed, on taking it off I found many toads, and having cut some asunder with my knife, by ac∣cident, to get off the weed, found them full of spawn not thoroughly formed. I am not positive, but think there were a few males in <HI>March:</HI> I know there are thirty
<PB N="329" REF="360"/>males <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>John Hunter</HI> has assured me that during his residence at <HI>Belleisle,</HI> he dissected some hundreds of toads, yet never met with a single female among them.</NOTE> to one female, twelve or fourteen of whom I have seen cling∣ing round a female: I have often disengaged her, and put her into a solitary male, to see with what eager∣ness he would seize her. They im∣pregnate the spawn as it is drawn <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">I was incredulous as to the <HI>obstetrical</HI> offices of the male toad, but since the end is so well accounted for, and the fact established by such good authority, belief must take place.
<P>Mr. <HI>Demours,</HI> in the Memoirs of the <HI>French</HI> Academy, as translated by Dr. <HI>Templeman, vol.</HI> I. 371. has been very particular in respect to the male toad, as acting the part of an <HI>Accoucheur;</HI> his account is curious, and clames a place here:
<Q><P>In the evening of one of the long days in summer, Mr. <HI>Demours</HI> being in the king's garden perceived two toads <HI>cou∣pled together</HI> at the edge of an hole, which was formed in part by a great stone at the top.</P>
<P>Curiosity drew him to see what was the occasion of the mo∣tions he observed, when two facts equally new surprized him; the <HI>first</HI> was the extreme difficulty the female had in laying her eggs, insomuch that she did not seem capable of being delivered of them without some assistance. The <HI>second</HI> was, that the male was mounted on the back of the female, and exerted all his strength with his hinder feet in pulling out the eggs, whilst his fore-feet embraced her breast.</P>
<P>In order to apprehend the manner of his working in the delivery of the female, the reader must observe that the paws of these animals, as well those of the fore-feet as of the hin∣der, are divided into several toes, which can perform the office of fingers.</P>
<P>It must be remarked likewise, that the eggs of this species of toads are included each in a membranous coat that is very firm, in which is contained the embryo; and that these eggs, which are oblong and about two lines in length, being fasten∣ed one to another by a short but very strong cord form a kind of chaplet, the beads of which are distant from each other about the half of their length. It is by drawing this cord with his paw that the male performs the function of a mid∣wife, and acquits himself in it with a dexterity that one would not expect from so lumpish an animal.</P>
<P>The presence of the observer did not a little discompose the male; for some time he stopped short, and threw on the <HI>curious impertinent</HI> a fixed look that marked his disquietness and fear; but he soon returned to his work with more precipita∣tion than before, and a moment <HI>after</HI> he appeared undetermi∣ned whether he should continue it or not. The female like∣wise discovered her uneasiness at the sight of the stranger, by motions that interrupted sometimes the male in his operation. At length, whether the silence and steady posture of the spec∣tator had dissipated their fear, or that the <HI>cas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> was urgent, the male resumed his work with the same vigour, and success∣fully performed his function.</P></Q></P></NOTE> out in long strings, like a neck∣lace,
<PB N="330" REF="361"/>many yards long, not in a large, quantity of jelly, like frogs spawn. <HI>N. B.</HI> After having held a female some time in my hand, I have, to try if there was any smell, put my finger a foot under water to a male, who has immediately seized it, and stuck to as firmly as if it was a fe∣male. <HI>Quere,</HI> Would they seize a finger or rag that had touched a cancerous ulcer?</P>
<P>Sixthly, Insects being their food, I never saw any toad shew any lik∣ing or dislike to any plant <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This question arose from an assertion of <HI>Linnoeus,</HI> that the toad delighted in filthy herbs. <HI>Delectatur Cotula, Actoea, Stachyde foetidis.</HI> The unhappy deformity of the animal seems to be the only ground of this as well as another misrepresentation, of its conveying a poison from its pimples, its touch, and even its breath. <HI>Verrucae lactejcentes venenatoe infusoe tactu, anhelitu.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>Seventhly, I hardly remember any persons taking it up except
<PB N="331" REF="362"/>my father and myself: I do not know whether it had any particular attachment to us.</P>
<P>Eighhtly, In respect to its end, I answer this last quere. Had it not been for a tame raven, I make no doubt but it would have been now living; who one day seeing it at the mouth of its hole, pulled it out, and although I rescued it, pulled out one eye, and hurt it so, that notwithstanding its living a twelve∣month it never enjoyed itself, and had a difficulty of taking its food, missing the mark for want of its eye: before that accident had all the appearance of perfect health.</P></Q>
<P>What Mr. <HI>Pitfield</HI> communicated to me serves farther to evince the patient and pacific disposition of this poor ani∣mal. If I am thought to dwell too long on the subject, let it be consider∣ed, that those who have most unpro∣voked enemies, and fewest friends, clame the greatest pity, and warmest vindication. This reptile has under∣gone all sorts of scandal; one author makes it the companion of an atheist <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A great toad was said to have been found in the lodgings of <HI>Vanini,</HI> at <HI>Toulouse. Vide. Johnson</HI>'s Shakespear.</NOTE>; and <HI>Milton</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Paradise lost.</NOTE> makes the devil itself
<PB N="332" REF="363"/>its inmate; in a word, all kind of evil passions have been bestowed on it: It is but justice therefore to say some∣thing in behalf of an animal that has of late had so many tryals of its temper, from experiments occasioned by the new discovery of its cancer-sucking quali∣ties. It has born all the handling, teiz∣ing, bagging, &amp;c. &amp;c. without the lest sign of a vindictive disposition; but has even made itself a sacrifice to the discharge of its office: this I know from the result of much enquiry; would I could contradict what is asserted, p. 10, of the inefficacy of the tryals made of them in the most horrible of diseases; for at this time I myself cannot bring one proof of the success. But I would not have any one discouraged from the pursuit of the re∣medy. Heaven opens to us gradually its favors: the <HI>loadstone</HI> was for ages a meer matter of ignorant amaze at its attractive qualities: <HI>mercury</HI> was a sup∣posed poison, and the terror of physi∣cians: we now wonder at the powers of electricity, and are still but partially acquainted with its uses: the toad, the object of horror even in the most en∣lightened times, is found to be perfectly innocent; it has certainly contributed to the ease (and as has been said to the
<PB N="333" REF="364"/>cure) of the unhappy cancered; let the following facts speak for themselves; they come from persons of undoubted veracity, and will sufficiently establish the truth of the beneficent qualities of this animal.</P>
<P>The first paper relating to it is very ingeniously draw up by Mr. <HI>Pitfield,</HI> for the information of Doctor <HI>Littleton,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Carlisle,</HI> (now happy) who immediately honored me with the copy.</P>
<P><HI>Exon, Aug.</HI> 29, 1768.</P>
<Q><P>Your lordship must have taken notice of a paragraph in the papers, with regard to the application of toads to a cancered breast. A pa∣tient of mine has sent to the neigh∣borhood of <HI>Hungerford,</HI> and brought down the very woman on whom the cure was done. I have, with all the attention I am capable of, at∣tended the operation for eighteen or twenty days, and am surprized at the phaenomenon. I am in no ex∣pectation of any great service from the application: the age, constitu∣tion, and thoroughly cancerous con∣dition of the person, being uncon∣querable barriers to it. How an ail of that kind, absolutely local, in an otherwise sound habit, and of a
<PB N="334" REF="365"/>likely age, might be relieved, I can∣not say. But as to the operation, thus much I can assert, that there is neither pain nor nauseousness in it. The animal is put into a linen bag, all but its head, and that is held to the part. It has generally instantly laid hold of the foulest part of the sore, and sucked with greediness until it dropped off dead. It has frequently happened that the crea∣ture has swolen immensely, and from its agonies appeared to be in great pain. I have weighed them for several days together, before and after the application, and found their increase of weight, in the dif∣ferent degrees, from a drachm to near an ounce. They frequently sweat exceedingly, and turn quite pale: sometimes they disgorge, reco∣ver, and become lively again. I think the whole scene is surprising, and a very remarkable piece of natural history. From the constant inof∣fensiveness which I have observed in them, I almost question the truth of their poisonous spitting. Many peo∣ple here expect no great good from the application of toads to cancers; and where the disorder is not abso∣lutely local, none is to be expected;
<PB N="335" REF="366"/>where it is, and seated in any part, not to be well come at for extirpa∣tion, I think it is hardly to be ima∣gined, but that the having it sucked clean as often as you please, must give great relief. Every body knows, that dogs licking of sores cures them, which is, I suppose, chiefly by keeping them clean. If there is any credit to be given to history, poisons have been sucked out, —<HI>Pallentia Vulnera lambit Ore Venera trahens.</HI> are the words of <HI>Lucan</HI> on the oc∣casion: if the people to whom these words are applied, did their cure by immediately following the injection of the poison, the local confinement of another poison brings the case to a great degree of similarity.</P>
<P>I hope I have not tired your lord∣ship with my long tale, as it is a true one, and in my apprehension a curi∣ous piece of natural history, I could not forbear communicating it to you. I own I thought the story in the pa∣pers to be an invention, and when I
<PB N="336" REF="367"/>considered the instinctive principle in all animals of self preservation, I was confirmed in my disbelief; but what I have related I saw, and all theory must yield to fact. It is only the <HI>Rubeta,</HI> the land toad, which has the property of sucking; I can∣not find any the lest mention of the property in any one of the old naturalists. My patient can bear to have but one applied in twenty-four hours: the woman who was cured had them on day and night, with∣out intermission, for five weeks. Their time of hanging at the breast has been from one to six hours.</P></Q>
<P>The other account is of a woman now under the experiment, which I give, as delivered to me from un∣doubted authority. If the event is prosperous, an early opportunity shall be taken of informing the public of it in some of the news-papers, with all circumstances of place, name, &amp;c. which at present it is needless to men∣tion.</P>
<P>About six years ago a poor woman received a crush on her breast by the fall of a pail; a cancerous complaint was the result.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="368"/>Last year her disorder increased to an alarming degree; she had five wounds on her breasts, one exceeding large, from which fragments of bone worked out, giving her vast pain; and at the same time there was a great discharge of thin yellow mat∣ter: she was likewise reduced to a meer skeleton.</P>
<P>All her left side and stomach was much swelled; her fingers doughy and discolored.</P>
<P>On the 25th of <HI>September,</HI> 1768, the first toad was applied; between that and the 29th she used seven, and had that night better rest. She swal∣lowed with greater ease, for before that time there was some appearance of humor in her neck, and a difficulty of getting any thing down.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 16th, the patient better. It was thought proper as winter was coming on, and of course it would be very difficult to procure a number of toads, to apply more at a time, so three were put on at once. the swel∣ling in the arm abated, and the wo∣man's rest was good.</P>
<P>During these tryals she took an in∣fusion of <HI>Water Parsnep</HI> with <HI>Pulvis Cornacchini.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="338" REF="369"/><HI>December</HI> 18th, continued to look ill, but finds herself better: two of the wounds were now healed.</P>
<P>She was always most easy when the toads were sucking, of which she kil∣led vast numbers in the operation.</P>
<P><HI>January</HI> 1769. The last account that was received, informing that the patient was better.</P>
<P>The remarks made on the animals, are these: Some toads died very soon after they had sucked; others lived about a quarter of an hour, but some lived much longer: for example, one that was applied about seven o'clock sucked till ten, and died as soon as it was taken from the breast; another that immediately succeeded continued till three o'clock, but dropped dead from the wound, each swelled exceedingly, and turned of a pale color.</P>
<P>These toads did not seem to suck greedily, and would often turn their heads away; but during the time of sucking were heard to smack their lips like a young child.</P>
<P>As those reptiles are apt by their struggles to get out of the bag, the open end ought to be made with an open hem, that the string may run the
<PB N="339" REF="370"/>more readily, and fasten tightly about the neck.</P>
<P>It would be improper to quit the subject without mentioning the ori∣gin of this strange discovery, which was owing to a woman near <HI>Hunger∣ford,</HI> who labored under a cancerous complaint in her breast, which had long baffled all applications.</P>
<P>The account she gives of the man∣ner in which she came by her know∣lege is very singular, and I may say apocryphal. She says of herself, that in the height of her disorder she went to some church where there was a vast crowd: on going into a pew, she was accosted by a strange clergyman, who, after expressing compassion for her situation, told her that if she would make such an application of living toads <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have been told that she not only made use of living toads, but permitted the dead ones to remain at her breast, by way of cataplasms, for some weeks.</NOTE> as abovementioned, she would be well.</P>
<P>This dark story is all we can collect relating to the affair. It is our opi∣nion that she stumbled upon the dis∣covery by accident, and that having set up for a cancer doctress, she thought it necessary to amuse the world with
<PB N="340" REF="371"/>this mysterious relation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Valentine Greatraks,</HI> who about the year 1664, per∣suaded himself that he could cure diseases, by stroking them out of the parts affected with his hand; and the famous <HI>Bridget Bostock,</HI> of <HI>Cheshire,</HI> who worked cures by virtue of her fasting spittle, both came by their art in a manner supernatural, but by <HI>faith many were made whole.</HI></NOTE> For it seems very unaccountable, that this unknown gentleman should express so much tenderness for this single sufferer, and not feel any for the many thou∣sands that daily languish under this terrible disorder: would he not have made use of this invaluable nostrum for his own emolument, or at lest, by some other means have found a method of making it public for the good of mankind.</P>
<P>Here I take leave of the subject, which I could not do without expres∣sing my doubts, as to the method of the woman's obtaining her informa∣tion; but in respect to the authenti∣city of this new-discovered property of the toad, facts establish it beyond dispute. Let the humane wish for speedy proofs of the efficacy; and for the satisfaction of the world, let those who are capable of giving indisputable proofs of the success, take the earliest opportunity of making the public ac∣quainted with so interesting an affair.</P>
<P><PB N="341" REF="372"/><HI>Keysler, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Viper, <HI>21.</HI></NOTE> vol.</HI> III. 237, relates, that Sir <HI>Kenelm Digby</HI> used to feed his wife, who was a most beautiful woman, with capons fattened with the flesh of vipets.</P>
<P>The traveller does not quote his authority; but the lady did not long survive this strange regimen.</P>
<P>In <HI>Sueden</HI> is a small reddish serpent, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Blind worm, <HI>26.</HI></NOTE> called there the <HI>Asping,</HI> the <HI>Coluber Chersea,</HI> of <HI>Linnoeus:</HI> it is small, and of a reddish color, and its bite is said to be mortal.</P>
<P>May it not have been from a ser∣pent of this species, that the man in <HI>Oxfordshire</HI> received his death?</P>
<P>This reminds me of another <HI>Welch</HI> word that is explanatory of the cus∣toms of the antients, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Glain Neidr, <HI>23.</HI></NOTE> shewing their intent in the use of the plant <HI>Vervaine</HI> in their lustrations; and why it was called by <HI>Dioscorides Hierobotane,</HI> or the sacred plant, and esteemed proper to be hung up in their rooms.</P>
<P>The <HI>British</HI> name <HI>Cas gan Cythrawl,</HI> or the Devil's aversion, may be a mo∣dern appellation, but is likewise called <HI>Y Dderwen fendigaid,</HI> the holy oak, which evidently refers to the <HI>Druids</HI> groves.</P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="373"/><HI>Pliny</HI> informs us, that the <HI>Gauls</HI> used it in their incantations, as the <HI>Ro∣mans</HI> and <HI>Greeks</HI> did in their lustrations. <HI>Terence,</HI> in his <HI>Andria,</HI> shews us the <HI>Verbena</HI> was placed on altars before the doors of private houses in <HI>Athens;</HI> and from the same passage in <HI>Pliny</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. <HI>xxv.</HI> cap. <HI>9.</HI></NOTE>, we find the <HI>Magi</HI> were guilty of the most extravagant superstition about this herb. Strange it is that such a vene∣ration should arise for a plant endued with no perceptible qualities; and stranger still it should spread from the farthest north to the boundaries of <HI>In∣dia.</HI> So general a consent, however, proves the custom arose before the dif∣ferent nations had lost all communica∣tion with each other.</P>
<P>This species, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Basking Shark, <HI>78.</HI></NOTE> on comparing a rude sketch of one taken in the <HI>Caernar∣vonshire</HI> seas, with an engraving of the <HI>Squalus Maximus</HI> in Bishop <HI>Gunner</HI>'s <HI>Acta Nidrosiana,</HI> we find them to be the same, and that it has a small anal fin, which probably was overlooked by the <HI>Welch</HI> fishermen.</P>
<P>The mouth of the sturgeon when dead is always open; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sturgeon, <HI>96.</HI></NOTE> when alive it can
<PB N="343" REF="374"/>close or open it at pleasure, by means of certain muscles, which also assist it in protruding or drawing it in. <HI>Pliny</HI> speaking of his <HI>Acipenser,</HI> makes it synonymous with the <HI>Elops, Quidam eum</HI> ELOPEM <HI>vocant.</HI></P>
<P>This is a kind of <HI>Wrasse</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide p. <HI>203.</HI></NOTE>, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ballan.</NOTE> sent from <HI>Scarborough</HI> by Mr. <HI>Travis,</HI> differing from the other species. They appear during summer in great shoals off <HI>Filey-Bridge:</HI> the largest weigh about five pounds.</P>
<P>It was of the form of the common <HI>wrasse,</HI> only between the dorsal fin and the tail was a considerable sink∣ing: above the nose was a deep sulcus: on the farthest cover of the gills was a depression radiated from the center.</P>
<P>It had only four branchiostegous rays.</P>
<P>The dorsal fin had thirty-one rays, twenty spiny, eleven soft; the last branched, and much longer than the spiny rays.</P>
<P>The pectoral fins had fourteen; the ventral six; the first of which was short and spiny: the anal twelve; the three first spiny, the nine others branched and soft.</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="375"/>The tail was rounded at the end; at the bottom, for about a third part of the way, between each ray was a row of scales.</P>
<P>The color in general was yellow, spotted with orange.</P>
