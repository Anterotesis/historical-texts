<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT would be very flattering to me, if I might hope that the little Tale, which I now take the liberty of presenting to you, could amuse a few moments of your tedious indisposition. It is, I confess, but a paltry return for the many hours of agreeable information, and elegant amusement, which I have received from your spirited and very entertaining writings: yet
<PB REF="3"/>
I am persuaded, that you will receive it with favour, as a small offering of esteem and gra∣titude, of which the intention alone makes all the little value.</P>
<P>The slight verses, Sir, which I place under your protection, will not, I fear, impress the world with a very favourable idea of my poetical powers: But I shall, at least, be suspected of having some taste, and of keeping good com∣pany, when I confes s that some of the pleasant∣est hours of my life have been passed in your conversation. I should be unjust to your very engaging and well-bred turn of wit, if I did not declare that, among all the lively and brilliant things I have heard from you, I do not remember ever to have heard an unkind, or an ungenerous one: Let me be allowed to bear my feeble testimony to your temperate use of this charming faculty, so delightful in
<PB REF="4"/>
itself, but which can only be safely trusted in such hands as yours, where it is guarded by politeness, and directed by humanity.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I have the honour to be, SIR, Your much obliged, And most obedient Humble Servant,
HANNAH MORE.</SIGNED>

<HEAD>FLORIO: A POETICAL TALE, FOR FINE GENTLEMEN AND FINE LADIES.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>FLORIO, a youth of gay renown,</L>
<L>Who figur'd much about the Town,</L>
<L>Had pass'd, with general approbation,</L>
<L>The modish forms of Education;</L>
<L>Knew what was proper to be known,<MILESTONE N="5"/></L>
<L>Th' establislih'd jargon of Bon-ton;</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="7"/>Had learnt, with very moderate reading,</L>
<L>The whole new system of good breeding:</L>
<L>Knew to be negligent and rude;</L>
<L>But still his feelings wou'd intrude:<MILESTONE N="10"/></L>
<L>For FLORIO was not meant by nature,</L>
<L>A silly, or a worthless creature:</L>
<L>He had a heart dispos'd to feel,</L>
<L>Had sense and spirit, taste and zeal;</L>
<L>Was handsome, generous; but, by fate,<MILESTONE N="15"/></L>
<L>Predestin'd to a large estate!</L>
<L>Hence all the hopes he gave were foil'd;</L>
<L>His mind by praise and pleasure spoil'd.</L>
<L>The Destiny, who wove the thread</L>
<L>Of FLORIO'S being, sigh'd, and said,<MILESTONE N="20"/></L>
<L>Poor youth! this cumbrous twist of gold,</L>
<L>More, than my shuttle well can hold,</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="8"/>For which thy anxious fathers toil'd,</L>
<L>Thy white and even thread has spoil'd:</L>
<L>This shall seduce thy pliant youth <MILESTONE N="25"/></L>
<L>From sense, simplicity, and truth;</L>
<L>Thy erring fire, by this misled,</L>
<L>Shall scatter pleasures round thy head,</L>
<L>When wholesome disicipline's controul,</L>
<L>Shou'd brace the sinews of thy soul; <MILESTONE N="30"/></L>
<L>Coldly thou'lt toil for Learning's prize,</L>
<L>For why shou'd he that's rich be wise?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The gracious Master of mankind,</L>
<L>Who knew us vain, and weak, and blind,</L>
<L>In mercy, tho' in anger, said,<MILESTONE N="35"/></L>
<L>That man shou'd earn his daily bread;</L>
<L>Who counteracts the order given,</L>
<L>Disputes the high behest of Heaven.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="9"/>Forgive (nor lay the fault on me)</L>
<L>This mixture of mythology; <MILESTONE N="40"/></L>
<L>The bard of Paradise has deign'd</L>
<L>With truth to mingle fables feign'd;</L>
<L>Who cannot reach his style, or thoughts,</L>
<L>With ease may irritate his faults.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Poor FLORIO, at the ardent age <MILESTONE N="45"/></L>
<L>When youth shou'd rush on Glory's stage;</L>
<L>When Life shou'd open fresh and fair,</L>
<L>And Hope advance with smiling air;</L>
<L>Of youthful gaiety bereft,</L>
<L>Had scarce an unbroach'd pleasure left; <MILESTONE N="50"/></L>
<L>He found already to his cost,</L>
<L>The shining gloss of life was lost;</L>
<L>And Pleasure was so coy a prude,</L>
<L>She fled the more the more pursued.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="10"/>But FLORIO knew the WORLD, that Science <MILESTONE N="55"/></L>
<L>Set Sense and Learning at defiance;</L>
<L>He thought the world to him was known,</L>
<L>Whereas he only knew the <HI>Town;</HI></L>
<L>In men this blunder still you find,</L>
<L>All think their little set—Mankind.<MILESTONE N="60"/></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tho' high renown the youth had gain'd,</L>
<L>No flagrant crimes his life had stain'd;</L>
<L>No tool of falsehood, slave of passion,</L>
<L>But spoilt by CUSTOM, and the FASHION.</L>
<L>Tho' known among <HI>a certain set,</HI><MILESTONE N="65"/></L>
<L>He did not like to be in debt;</L>
<L>He shudder'd at the dicer's box,</L>
<L>Nor thought it very heterodox</L>
<L>That tradesmen shou'd be sometimes paid,</L>
<L>And promises be kept when made.<MILESTONE N="70"/></L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="11"/>His utmost credit, as a sinner,</L>
<L>Was that he sometimes spoilt a dinner;</L>
<L>Ever, by system, came too late,</L>
<L>And made his choicest parties wait;</L>
<L>Yet 'twas a hopeful indication,<MILESTONE N="75"/></L>
<L>On which to found a reputation:</L>
<L>Small habits, well pursued betimes,</L>
<L>May reach the dignity of crimes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His mornings were not spent in vice,</L>
<L>'Twas lounging, sauntering, eating ice:<MILESTONE N="80"/></L>
<L>Walk up and down St. James's Street,</L>
<L>Full fifty times the youth you'd meet:</L>
<L>He hated cards, detested drinking,</L>
<L>But stroll'd to shun the toil of thinking;</L>
<L>'Twas doing nothing was his curse,<MILESTONE N="85"/></L>
<L>Is there a vice can plague us worse?</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="12"/>The wretch who digs the mine for bread,</L>
<L>Or ploughs, that others may be fed,</L>
<L>Feels less fatigue than that decreed</L>
<L>To him who cannot think, or read.<MILESTONE N="90"/></L>
<L>Not all the struggle of temptation,</L>
<L>Not all the furious war of passion,</L>
<L>Can quench the spark of Glory's flame,</L>
<L>Or blot out Virtue's very name;</L>
<L>Like the true taste for genuine saunter,<MILESTONE N="95"/></L>
<L>No rival passions can supplant her;</L>
<L>They rule in short and quick succession,</L>
<L>But SLOTH keeps one long, fast possession;</L>
<L>Ambition's reign is quickly clos'd,</L>
<L>Th' usurper Rage is soon depos'd; <MILESTONE N="100"/></L>
<L>Intemperance, where there's no temptation,</L>
<L>Makes voluntary abdication;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="13"/>Of other tyrants short the strife,</L>
<L>But INDOLENCE is king for life.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet tho' so polish'd FLORIO'S breeding,<MILESTONE N="105"/></L>
<L>Think him not ignorant of reading;</L>
<L>For he, to keep him from the vapours,</L>
<L>Subscrib'd at HOOKHAM'S, saw the papers;</L>
<L>Was deep in Poet's-corner wit,</L>
<L>Knew what was in Italics writ; <MILESTONE N="110"/></L>
<L>Explain'd fictitious names at will,</L>
<L>Each gutted syllable cou'd fill;</L>
<L>There oft, in paragraphs, his name</L>
<L>Gave symptom sweet of growing fame,</L>
<L>Tho' yet they serv'd but to apprize <MILESTONE N="115"/></L>
<L>Of buttons' form, or buckles' size.</L>
<L>He studied while he dress'd, for true 'tis</L>
<L>He read Compendiums, Extracts, Beauties,</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="14"/>Abregés, Dictionnaires, Recueils,</L>
<L>Mercures, Journaux, Extraits, and Feuilles:<MILESTONE N="120"/></L>
<L>No work in substance now is follow'd,</L>
<L>The Chemic Extract only's swallow'd.</L>
<L>He lik'd those literary cooks</L>
<L>Who skim the cream of others' books,</L>
<L>And ruin half an Author's graces,<MILESTONE N="125"/></L>
<L>By plucking bons-mots from their places;</L>
<L>He wonders any writing sells,</L>
<L>But these spic'd mushrooms and morells;</L>
<L>His palate these alone can touch,</L>
<L>Where every mouthful is <HI>bonne bouche.</HI></L>
<L>Of each new Play he saw a part,</L>
<L>And all the <HI>Anas</HI> had by heart;</L>
<L>He found whatever they produce</L>
<L>Is fit for conversation-use;</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="15"/>Is ever ready for display; <MILESTONE N="135"/></L>
<L>A page would prime him for a day:</L>
<L>They cram not with a mass of knowledge,</L>
<L>Which smacks of toil, and smells of college,</L>
<L>Which in the memory useless lies,</L>
<L>And only makes men—good and wise.<MILESTONE N="140"/></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A friend he had, BELLARIO hight,</L>
<L>A reasoning, reading, learned wight;</L>
<L>At least, with men of FLORIO'S breeding,</L>
<L>He was a prodigy of reading.</L>
<L>He knew each stale and vapid lye <MILESTONE N="145"/></L>
<L>In tomes of French Philosophy;</L>
<L>And then, we fairly may presume,</L>
<L>From PYRRHO down to DAVID HUME,</L>
<L>'Twere difficult to single out</L>
<L>A man more full of shallow doubt; <MILESTONE N="150"/></L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="16"/>He knew the little sceptic prattle,</L>
<L>The sophist's paltry arts of battle;</L>
<L>Talk'd gravely of th' atomic dance,</L>
<L>Of moral fitness, fate, and chance;</L>
<L>Quoted the nonsense of LUCRETIUS,<MILESTONE N="155"/></L>
<L>Stripp'd of the charm which makes it specious;</L>
<L>Dropt hints, with wondrous penetration,</L>
<L>Against the history of Creation;</L>
<L>Then prov'd, by argument circuitous,</L>
<L>The combination was fortuitous:<MILESTONE N="160"/></L>
<L>Swore, Priests whole trade was to deceive,</L>
<L>And prey on bigots who believe;</L>
<L>With bitter ridicule cou'd jeer,</L>
<L>And had the true free-thinking sneer;</L>
<L>Stale arguments he had in store,<MILESTONE N="165"/></L>
<L>Which have been answer'd o'er and o'er.</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="17"/>Practis'd, to raise his reputation,</L>
<L>The trite, old trick of false citation;</L>
<L>And wou'd from ancient Authors quote</L>
<L>A sentiment they never wrote.<MILESTONE N="170"/></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Upon his highest shelf there stood</L>
<L>The Classics, neatly cut in wood;</L>
<L>And in a more commodious station,</L>
<L>You found them in a French translation:</L>
<L>He swears, 'tis from the Greek he quotes,<MILESTONE N="175"/></L>
<L>But keeps the French, just for the notes.</L>
<L>He worshipp'd certain modern names</L>
<L>Who History write in Epigrams,</L>
<L>In pointed periods, shining phrases,</L>
<L>And all the small poetic daisies,<MILESTONE N="180"/></L>
<L>Which crowd the pert and florid style,</L>
<L>Where fact is dropt to raise a smile;</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="18"/>Arts scorn'd by History's sober Muse,</L>
<L>Arts CLARENDON disdain'd to use.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whate'er the subject of debate,<MILESTONE N="185"/></L>
<L>'Twas larded still with sceptic prate;</L>
<L>The good, with shame I speak it, feel</L>
<L>Not half this proselyting zeal.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tho' FLORIO did not yet believe him,</L>
<L>He thought, why shou'd a friend deceive him?<MILESTONE N="190"/></L>
<L>Much as he priz'd BELLARIO'S wit,</L>
<L>He lik'd not all his notions yet;</L>
<L>He thought him charming, pleasant, odd,</L>
<L>But hop'd he might believe in God;</L>
<L>Still, tho' he tried a thousand ways,<MILESTONE N="195"/></L>
<L>Truth's insuppressive torch wou'd blaze;</L>
<L>Where once her flame has burnt, I doubt</L>
<L>If ever it go fairly out.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="14" REF="19"/>
<L>Yet, under great BELLARIO'S care,</L>
<L>He gain'd each day a better air; <MILESTONE N="200"/></L>
<L>With many a leader of renown,</L>
<L>Deep in the learning of the Town,</L>
<L>Who never other science knew,</L>
<L>But what from that prime source they drew;</L>
<L>Pleas'd, to the opera they repair,<MILESTONE N="205"/></L>
<L>To get recruits of knowledge there;</L>
<L>Mythology gain at a glance,</L>
<L>And learn the Classics from a dance:</L>
<L>For tho' they never car'd a groat,</L>
<L>How far'd the vent'rous Argonaut,<MILESTONE N="210"/></L>
<L>Yet, pleas'd, they see MEDEA rise</L>
<L>On fiery dragons to the skies:</L>
<L>For DIDO, tho' they never knew her</L>
<L>As MARO'S magic pencil drew her,</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="20"/>Fond as she was, and broken-hearted,<MILESTONE N="215"/></L>
<L>Her pious vagabond departed;</L>
<L>Yet, for DIDONE how they roar!</L>
<L>And <HI>Cara! Cara!</HI> loud encore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>One taste, BELLARIO'S soul possess'd,</L>
<L>The master passion of his breast; <MILESTONE N="220"/></L>
<L>Not one of those frail, transient joys,</L>
<L>Which, by possession, quickly cloys;</L>
<L>This bliss was solid, constant, true,</L>
<L>'Twas action, and 'twas passion too;</L>
<L>For tho' the business might be finish'd,<MILESTONE N="225"/></L>
<L>The pleasure scarcely was diminish'd;</L>
<L>Did he ride out, or sit, or walk,</L>
<L>Still he liv'd o'er again in talk</L>
<L>This keen, this ever new delight,</L>
<L>His joy by day, his dream by night.<MILESTONE N="230"/></L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="21"/>'Twas eating did his soul allure,</L>
<L>In short, a modish Epicure;</L>
<L>Tho' once this word, as I opine,</L>
<L>Meant not such men as live to dine,</L>
<L>Yet all our modern Wits assure us,<MILESTONE N="235"/></L>
<L>That's all they know of EPICURUS:</L>
<L>They fondly fancy, that repletion</L>
<L>Was the <HI>chief good</HI> of that fam'd Grecian.</L>
<L>To live in gardens full of flowers,</L>
<L>And talk philosophy in bowers,<MILESTONE N="240"/></L>
<L>Or, in the covert of a wood,</L>
<L>To descant on the <HI>sovereign good,</HI></L>
<L>Might be the notion of their founder,</L>
<L>But they have notions vastly sounder;</L>
<L>Their bolder standards they erect,<MILESTONE N="245"/></L>
<L>To form a more voluptuous sect;</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="22"/>Old EPICURUS wou'd not own 'em,</L>
<L>A dinner is their <HI>summum bonum.</HI></L>
<L>You'll rather find such sparks as these</L>
<L>Like EPICURUS' deities; <MILESTONE N="250"/></L>
<L>Like them they laugh at human cares,</L>
<L>And with disdain view all affairs.</L>
<L>BELLARIO had embrac'd with glee,</L>
<L>This practical philosophy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Young FLORIO'S father had a friend,<MILESTONE N="255"/></L>
<L>And ne'er did Heaven a worthier send;</L>
<L>A cheerful knight of good estate,</L>
<L>Whose heart was warm, whose bounty great.</L>
<L>At Christmas still his oxen bled,</L>
<L>With which the grateful poor were fed; <MILESTONE N="260"/></L>
<L>Resentment vanish'd where he came,</L>
<L>And law-suits died before his name;</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="23"/>The old esteem'd, the young caress'd him,</L>
<L>And all the smiling village bless'd him.</L>
<L>Within his Castle's Gothic gate,<MILESTONE N="265"/></L>
<L>Sate Plenty, and old-fashion'd State:</L>
<L>Scarce Prudence cou'd his bounties stint;—</L>
<L>Such characters are out of print:</L>
<L>O! wou'd kind Heaven, the age to mend,</L>
<L>A new edition of them send,<MILESTONE N="270"/></L>
<L>Before our tottering Castles fall,</L>
<L>And swarming Nabobs seize on all!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some little whims he had, 'tis true,</L>
<L>But they were harmless, and were few;</L>
<L>He dreaded nought like alteration,<MILESTONE N="275"/></L>
<L>Improvement still was innovation;</L>
<L>He said, when any change was brewing,</L>
<L>Reform was a fine name for ruin;</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="24"/>He thought 'twou'd shew a falling state,</L>
<L>If STERNHOLD shou'd give way to TATE.<MILESTONE N="280"/></L>
<L>This ever dwelt upon his tongue,</L>
<L>How things were chang'd since he was young!</L>
<L>Of moderate parts, of moderate wit,</L>
<L>But parts for life and business fit:</L>
<L>He of no history made profession,<MILESTONE N="285"/></L>
<L>But of the Protestant succession:</L>
<L>On all occasions, ne'er wou'd fail,</L>
<L>At Popery and the FRENCH to rail.</L>
<L>Of BLACKSTONE he had read a part,</L>
<L>And all BURN'S JUSTICE knew by heart:<MILESTONE N="290"/></L>
<L>In books that he might waste no minute,</L>
<L>His poetry had business in it;</L>
<L>He ne'er had heard of Bards of Greece,</L>
<L>But had read half of "DYER'S Fleece;"</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="25"/>To make his sphere of knowledge wider,<MILESTONE N="295"/></L>
<L>His Georgics, "PHILIPS upon cyder:"</L>
<L>He cou'd produce in proper place,</L>
<L>Three apt quotations from the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A Poem by Mr. SOMERVILE.</NOTE> "Chace,"</L>
<L>And in the hall, from day to day,</L>
<L>Old ISAAC WALTON'S angler lay.<MILESTONE N="300"/></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This good and venerable knight,</L>
<L>One daughter had, his soul's delight:</L>
<L>For face, no mortal cou'd resist her,</L>
<L>She smil'd like HEBE'S youngest sister:</L>
<L>Her life, as lovely as her face,<MILESTONE N="305"/></L>
<L>Each duty mark'd with every grace;</L>
<L>Her native sense improv'd by reading,</L>
<L>Her native sweetness by good-breeding:</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="26"/>No pretty starts of feign'd surprise,</L>
<L>No sweet minauderies clos'd her eyes; <MILESTONE N="310"/></L>
<L>Led by Simplicity divine,</L>
<L>She pleas'd, and never tried to shine;</L>
<L>She gave to Chance each unschool'd feature,</L>
<L>And left her cause to Sense and Nature.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Sire of FLORIO, ere he died,<MILESTONE N="315"/></L>
<L>Decreed fair CELIA, FLORIO'S bride;</L>
<L>Bade him his latest wish attend,</L>
<L>And win the daughter of his friend;</L>
<L>When the last rites to him were paid,</L>
<L>He charg'd him to address the maid:<MILESTONE N="320"/></L>
<L>Sir GILBERT'S heart the wish approv'd,</L>
<L>For much his ancient friend he lov'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Six rapid months like lightning fly,</L>
<L>And the last grey was now thrown by;</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="27"/>FLORIO, reluctant, calls to mind <MILESTONE N="325"/></L>
<L>The orders of a Sire too kind:</L>
<L>Yet go he must; he must fulfil</L>
<L>The hard conditions of the will:</L>
<L>Go, at that precious hour of prime,</L>
<L>Go, at that swarming, bustling time,<MILESTONE N="330"/></L>
<L>When the full Town to joy invites,</L>
<L>Distracted with its own delights;</L>
<L>When Pleasure pours from her full urn,</L>
<L>Each tiresome transport in its turn;</L>
<L>When Dissipation's altars blaze,<MILESTONE N="335"/></L>
<L>And men run mad a thousand ways;</L>
<L>When, on his tablets, there were found</L>
<L>Engagements for full six weeks round;</L>
<L>Must leave, with grief and desperation,</L>
<L>Three packs of cards of invitation,<MILESTONE N="340"/></L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="28"/>And all the wearisome delights</L>
<L>Of slavish days, and sleepless nights.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye Nymphs, whom tyrant Power drags down,</L>
<L>With hand despotic, from the Town,</L>
<L>When ALMACK'S doors wide open stand,<MILESTONE N="345"/></L>
<L>And the gay partner's offer'd hand</L>
<L>Courts to the dance; when steaming rooms,</L>
<L>Fetid with unguents and perfumes,</L>
<L>Invite you to the dear delight</L>
<L>Of well-bred crowds, and mobs polite; <MILESTONE N="350"/></L>
<L>You may conceive what FLORIO felt,</L>
<L>And sympathetically melt;</L>
<L>None else can guess the hardship dire,</L>
<L>To lawns and woodlands to retire,</L>
<L>When, freed from Winter's icy chain,<MILESTONE N="355"/></L>
<L>Glad Nature revels on the plain;</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="29"/>When blushing Spring leads on the hours,</L>
<L>And May is prodigal of flow'rs;</L>
<L>When Passion warbles thro' the grove,</L>
<L>And all is song, and all is love; <MILESTONE N="360"/></L>
<L>When new-born breezes sweep the vale,</L>
<L>And health adds fragrance to the gale.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Six bays, unconscious of their weight,</L>
<L>Soon lodg'd him at Sir GILBERT'S gate;</L>
<L>His trusty Swiss, who flew still faster,<MILESTONE N="365"/></L>
<L>Announc'd th' arrival of his Master:</L>
<L>So loud the rap which shook the door,</L>
<L>The hall re-echo'd to the roar;</L>
<L>Since first the Castle walls were rear'd,</L>
<L>So dread a sound had ne'er been heard; <MILESTONE N="370"/></L>

<L>Short joy! he enter'd, and the gate</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Who like Sir GILBERT now was blest?</L>

<L>Fair CELIA blush'd, and FLORIO utter'd</L>

<L>Tame expletives, with which dull Fashion <MILESTONE N="385"/></L>

<L>Yet, tho' disciple of cold Art,</L>

<L><PB N="26" REF="31"/>He saw; and but that Admiration,</L>

<L>Or had he been to Ton less true,</L>

<L>But, vainly speeds the surest dart,</L>
<L>Where FASHION'S mail defends the heart,</L>
<L>The shaft her cold repulsion found,<MILESTONE N="395"/></L>
<L>And fell, without the pow'r to wound:</L>
<L>For Fashion, with a mother's joy,</L>
<L>Dipp'd in her lake the darling boy,</L>
<L>That lake, whose chilling waves impart</L>
<L>The gift to freeze the warmest heart:<MILESTONE N="400"/></L>
<L>Yet, guarded as he was with phlegm,</L>
<L>With such delight he ey'd the dame,</L>

<L><PB N="27" REF="32"/>But all was safe; she saw and smil'd,<MILESTONE N="405"/></L>
<L>And claim'd the triumph of her child.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>CELIA a dinner still supplied,</L>
<L>Which modish luxury might deride:</L>

<L>A modest dinner best displays</L>

<L>And decent Elegance was there,</L>

<L>But vulgar plenty gave offence,<MILESTONE N="415"/></L>
<L>And shock'd poor FLORIO'S nicer sense:</L>

<L>Patient he yielded to his fate,</L>

<L>He bow'd submissive, made no question</L>

<L>But, such was his unlucky whim,<MILESTONE N="435"/></L>

<L>He dreamt, and lo! to charm his eyes,</L>

<L>The gracious vision wav'd his wand,</L>

<L>Th' imaginary savours rose <MILESTONE N="445"/></L>

<L>Alas! it rings for morning pray'rs.<MILESTONE N="450"/></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But how to spend next tedious morning,</L>

<L>Whate'er look'd small, whate'er look'd new,</L>
<L>Half-bound, or only stitch'd in blue; <MILESTONE N="460"/></L>
<L>Old play-bills, ASTLEY'S last year's feats,</L>
<L>And Opera disputes in sheets.</L>
<L>As these dear records meet his eyes,</L>
<L>Ghosts of departed pleasures rise;</L>
<L>He lays the book upon the shelf,<MILESTONE N="465"/></L>
<L>And leaves the day to spend itself.</L>
</LG>
<LG>

<L>And still his nimble spirits rise,<MILESTONE N="475"/></L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>A week he had resolv'd to stay,</L>

<L>Yet if the gentle maid was by,</L>
<L>Faint pleasure glisten'd in his eye;</L>
<L>But when no more the room she grac'd,</L>
<L>The slight impression was effac'd.</L>
<L><PB N="32" REF="37"/>Whene'er Sir GILBERT'S sporting guests <MILESTONE N="485"/></L>
<L>Retail'd old news, or older jests,</L>

<L>He did not even feign to hear 'em,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>CELIA perceiv'd his secret thoughts,</L>
<L>But lik'd the youth with all his faults;</L>
<L>Yet 'twas unlike, she softly said,</L>
<L>The tales of love which she had read,</L>
<L>Where heroes vow'd, and sigh'd, and knelt; <MILESTONE N="495"/></L>
<L>Nay, 'twas unlike the love she felt;</L>
<L>Tho' to her Sire, with fault'ring tongue,</L>
<L>She oft remark'd,—he was but young;</L>
<L>Confess'd his manners wrong in part,</L>
<L>But then—he had so good a heart!<MILESTONE N="500"/></L>
<L><PB N="33" REF="38"/>His interest farther to secure,</L>

<L>He had not time to feel in town;</L>
<L>Not that he blush'd to shew compassion,—</L>
<L>It chanc'd that year to be the fashion.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At length, to wake Ambition's flame,</L>
<L>A letter from BELLARIO came; <MILESTONE N="510"/></L>
<L>Announcing the supreme delight,</L>
<L>Preparing for a certain night,</L>
<L>By FLAVIA fair, return'd from France,</L>
<L>Who took him captive at a glance:</L>

<L>Five hundred cards!—a little, heaven!—</L>

<L>Of all the glories of the town,</L>

<L>His polish'd Sire, and high-bred Wife!</L>
<L>Thus, doubly to inflame, he tried</L>
<L>His curiosity, and pride.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The youth, with agitated heart,</L>
<L>Prepar'd directly to depart; <MILESTONE N="530"/></L>
<L>But, bound in honour to obey</L>
<L>His father, at no distant day,</L>
<L><PB N="35" REF="40"/>He promis'd soon to hasten down,</L>
<L>But business call'd him now to town;</L>
<L>Then faintly hints a cold proposal,<MILESTONE N="535"/></L>
<L>But leaves it to the Knight's disposal;</L>
<L>Stammer'd half words of love and duty,</L>
<L>And mutter'd much of—worth and—beauty;</L>
<L>Something of passion then he dropt,</L>
<L>And hop'd his ardour—Here he stopt; <MILESTONE N="540"/></L>
<L>For some remains of native truth</L>
<L>Flush'd in his face, and check'd the youth;</L>
<L>Yet still the ambiguous suffusion</L>
<L>Might pass for artless love's confusion.</L>
<L>The doating father thought 'twas strange,<MILESTONE N="545"/></L>
<L>But fancied men with times might change;</L>
<L>Yet own'd, nor cou'd he check his tongue,</L>
<L>It was not so when he was young.</L>
<L><PB N="36" REF="41"/>That was the reign of love he swore,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>In that blest age, for honour fam'd,</L>
<L>Love paid the homage Beauty claim'd;</L>
<L>Not that insipid, daudling Cupid,</L>
<L>With heart so hard, and air so stupid,</L>
<L>Who coldly courts the charms which lie <MILESTONE N="555"/></L>
<L>In Affectation's half-clos'd eye.</L>
<L>Love then was honest, genuine passon,</L>
<L>And manly gallantry the fashion;</L>
<L>Yet pure as ardent was the flame</L>
<L>Excited by the beauteous dame; <MILESTONE N="560"/></L>
<L>Hope cou'd subsist on slender bounties,</L>

</LG>

<L>Shou'd Beauty's Goddess now descend;</L>

<DIV1 TYPE="note">
<PB REF="70"/>
<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Trifle owes its birth and name to the mistake of a Foreigner of Distinction, who gave the literal appellation of the <HI>Bas-bleu,</HI> to a small party of friends, who had been sometimes called, by way of pleasantry, the Blue Stockings. The slight per∣formance, occasioned by this little circumstance, was never intended to appear in print: It is, in general, too local, and too personal for publication; and was only written with a wish to amuse the amiable Lady to whom it is addressed, and a few partial friends. But copies having been multiplied, far beyond the intention of the Author, she has been advised to publish it, lest it should steal into the world in a state of still greater imperfec∣tion; though she is almost ashamed to take refuge in so hackneyed an apology, however true.</P>

<L>VESEY! of Verse the judge and friend!</L>
<L>Awhile my idle strain attend:</L>
<L>Not with the days of early Greece,</L>
<L>I mean to ope' my slender piece;</L>
<L>The rare Symposium to proclaim,<MILESTONE N="5"/></L>
<L>Which crown'd th' Athenians' social name;</L>
<L>Or how ASPASIA'S parties shone,</L>

<L>How all that Rome esteem'd polite,</L>

<L>LUCULLUS, who, from Pontus come,</L>
<L>Brought conquests, and brought cherries home:</L>
<L>Name but the suppers in th' Apollo,<MILESTONE N="15"/></L>
<L>What classic images will follow!</L>
<L>How wit flew round, while each might take</L>
<L>Conchylia from the Lucrine lake;</L>
<L>And Attic Salt, and Garum Sauce,</L>
<L>And Lettuce from the Isle of Cos; <MILESTONE N="20"/></L>
<L>The first and last from Greece transplanted,</L>

<L>And quit the Muses' calmer field?</L>
<L>Taste thou the gentler joys they give; <MILESTONE N="210"/></L>
<L>With HORACE and with LELIUS live.</L>
<L>Hail, Conversation, soothing Power,</L>
<L>Sweet Goddess of the social hour!</L>
<L><PB N="81" REF="85"/>Not with more heart-felt warmth, at least,</L>
<L>Does LELIUS bend, thy true High Priest,<MILESTONE N="215"/></L>
<L>Than I, the lowest of thy train,</L>
<L>These field-flow'rs bring to deck thy fane;</L>
<L>Who to thy shrine like him can haste,</L>
<L>With warmer zeal, or purer taste?</L>
<L>O may thy worship long prevail,<MILESTONE N="220"/></L>
<L>And thy true votaries never fail!</L>
<L>Long may thy polish'd altars blaze</L>
<L>With wax-lights' undiminish'd rays!</L>
<L>Still be thy nightly offerings paid,</L>
<L>Libations large of Limonade!<MILESTONE N="225"/></L>
<L>On silver Vases, loaded, rise</L>
<L>The biscuits' ample sacrifice!</L>
<L>Nor be the milk-white streams forgot</L>
<L>Of thirst-assuaging, cool orgeat;</L>
<L><PB N="82" REF="86"/>Rise, incense pure from fragrant Tea,<MILESTONE N="230"/></L>
<L>Delicious incense, worthy Thee!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hail, Conversation, heav'nly fair,</L>
<L>Thou bliss of life, and balm of care!</L>
<L>Call forth the long-forgotten knowlege</L>
<L>Of school, of travel, and of college!<MILESTONE N="235"/></L>
<L>For thee, best solace of his toil!</L>
<L>The sage consumes his midnight oil;</L>
<L>And keeps late vigils, to produce</L>
<L>Materials for thy future use.</L>
<L>If none behold, ah! wherefore fair?<MILESTONE N="240"/></L>
<L>Ah! wherefore wise, if none must hear?</L>
<L>Our intellectual ore must shine,</L>
<L>Not slumber, idly, in the mine.</L>
<L>Let Education's moral mint</L>
<L>The noblest images imprint; <MILESTONE N="245"/></L>
<L><PB N="83" REF="87"/>Let Taste her curious touchstone hold,</L>
<L>To try if standard be the gold;</L>
<L>But 'tis thy commerce, Conversation,</L>
<L>Must give it use by circulation;</L>
<L>That noblest commerce of mankind,<MILESTONE N="250"/></L>
<L>Whose precious merchandize is MIND!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What stoic Traveller wou'd try</L>
<L>A sterile soul, and parching sky,</L>
<L>Or dare th' intemperate Northern zone,</L>
<L>If what he saw must ne'er be known?<MILESTONE N="255"/></L>
<L>For this he bids his home farewell,</L>
<L>The joy of seeing is to tell.</L>
<L>Trust me, he never wou'd have stirr'd,</L>
<L>Were he forbid to speak a word;</L>
<L>And Curiosity wou'd sleep,<MILESTONE N="260"/></L>
<L>If her own secrets she must keep:</L>
<L><PB N="84" REF="88"/>The bliss of telling what is past,</L>
<L>Becomes her rich reward at last.</L>
<L>Yet not from low desire to shine,</L>
<L>Does Genius toil in Learning's Mine; <MILESTONE N="265"/></L>
<L>Not to indulge in idle vision,</L>
<L>But strike new light by strong collision.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O'er books the mind inactive lies,</L>
<L>Books, the mind's food, not exercise!</L>
<L>Her vigorous wing she scarcely feels,<MILESTONE N="270"/></L>
<L>'Till use the latest strength reveals;</L>
<L>Her slumbering energies call'd forth,</L>
<L>She rises, conscious of her worth;</L>
<L>And, at her new-found powers elated,</L>
<L>Thinks them not rous'd, but new created.<MILESTONE N="275"/></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Enlighten'd spirits! you, who know</L>
<L>What charms from polish'd converse flow,</L>
<L><PB N="85" REF="89"/>Speak, for you can, the pure delight</L>
<L>When kindred sympathies unite;</L>
<L>When correspondent tastes impart <MILESTONE N="280"/></L>
<L>Communion sweet from heart to heart;</L>
<L>You ne'er the cold gradations need</L>
<L>Which vulgar souls to union lead;</L>
<L>No dry discussion to unfold</L>
<L>The meaning, caught as soon as told:<MILESTONE N="285"/></L>
<L>But sparks electric only strike</L>
<L>On souls electrical alike;</L>
<L>The flash of Intellect expires,</L>
<L>Unless it meet congenial fires.</L>
<L>The language to th' Elect alone <MILESTONE N="290"/></L>
<L>Is, like the Mason's mystery, known;</L>
<L>In vain th' unerring sign is made</L>
<L>To him who is not of the <HI>Trade.</HI></L>
<L><PB N="86" REF="90"/>What lively pleasure to divine,</L>
<L>The thought implied, the hinted line,<MILESTONE N="295"/></L>
<L>To feel Allusion's artful force,</L>
<L>And trace the Image to its source!</L>
<L>Quick Memory blends her scatter'd rays,</L>
<L>'Till Fancy kindles at the blaze;</L>
<L>The works of ages start to view,<MILESTONE N="300"/></L>
<L>And ancient Wit elicits new.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But wit and parts if thus we praise,</L>
<L>What nobler altars shou'd we raise,</L>
<L>Those sacrifices cou'd we see</L>
<L>Which Wit, O Virtue! makes to Thee.<MILESTONE N="305"/></L>
<L>At once the rising thought to dash,</L>
<L>To quench at once the bursting flash!</L>
<L>The shining Mischief to subdue,</L>
<L>And lose the praise, and pleasure too!</L>
<L><PB N="87" REF="91"/>This is high Principle's controul!<MILESTONE N="310"/></L>
<L>This is true continence of soul!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Blush, heroes, at your cheap renown,</L>
<L>A vanquish'd realm, a plunder'd town!</L>
<L>Your conquests were to gain a name,</L>
<L>This conquest triumphs over Fame; <MILESTONE N="315"/></L>
<L>So pure its essence; 'twere destroy'd.</L>
<L>If known, and if commended, void.</L>
<L>Amidst the brightest truths believ'd,</L>
<L>Amidst the fairest deeds atchiev'd,</L>
<L>Shall stand recorded and admir'd,<MILESTONE N="320"/></L>
<L>That Virtue sunk what Wit inspir'd!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But let the letter'd, and the fair,</L>
<L>And, chiefly, let the Wit beware;</L>
<L>You, whose warm spirits never fail,</L>
<L>Forgive the hint which ends my tale.<MILESTONE N="325"/></L>
<L><PB N="88" REF="92"/>Tho' Science nurs'd you in her bow'rs,</L>
<L>Tho' Fancy crown your brow with flowers,</L>
<L>Each thought, tho' bright Invention fill,</L>
<L>Tho' Attic bees each word distil;</L>
<L>Yet, if one gracious power refuse <MILESTONE N="330"/></L>
<L>Her gentle influence to infuse,</L>
<L>In vain shall listening crowds approve,</L>
<L>They'll praise you, but they will not love.</L>
<L>What is this power, you're loth to mention,</L>
<L>This charm, this witchcraft? 'tis ATTENTION:<MILESTONE N="335"/></L>
<L>Mute Angel, yes; thy looks dispense</L>
<L>The silence of intelligence;</L>
<L>Thy graceful form I well discern,</L>
<L>In act to listen and to learn;</L>
<L>'Tis Thou for talents shalt obtain <MILESTONE N="340"/></L>
<L>That pardon Wit wou'd hope in vain;</L>
<L><PB N="89" REF="93"/>Thy wond'rous power, thy secret charm,</L>
<L>Shall Envy of her sting disarm;</L>
<L>Thy silent flattery sooths our spirit,</L>
<L>And we forgive eclipsing merit; <MILESTONE N="345"/></L>
<L>The sweet atonement screens the fault,</L>
<L>And love and praise are cheaply bought.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With mild complacency to hear,</L>
<L>Tho' somewhat long the tale appear,—</L>
<L>Tis more than Wit, 'tis moral Beauty,<MILESTONE N="350"/></L>
<L>'Tis Pleasure rising out of Duty.</L>
