<P>HUMANITY, OR THE RIGHTS OF NATURE, A POEM; IN TWO BOOKS. <HI>BY THE AUTHOR OF</HI> SYMPATHY.</P>
<P><HI>LONDON:</HI> PRINTED FOR T. CADELL, STRAND.</P>
<P>1788.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Reader is requested to consider this Performance as a GENERAL OUTLINE, with here and there some sketched features, of a Work, the nature of which, is frequently alluded to in different parts of the Poem, and the Title is specified on a separate leaf at the end.</P>
<P>What I ventured abroad some years since under the title of SYMPATHY—a poem, which on account of the interests created in the Heart, by the subject itself, was received by the Public with so much generous warmth—was intended to serve as a Preliminary to what I had farther to observe on SOCIETY, or a Prospect of the HUMAN RACE, under the combined in∣fluences of CLIME and GOVERNMENT, RELIGIONS, LAWS and LIBERTIES—From these, the transition to TYRANNY was natu∣ral and strongly in connexion; and from TYRANNY, I felt my∣self called upon by all the awakened emotions of HUMANITY, to consider SLAVERY; but not only that species of it which consists in buying and selling our <HI>Fellow-Creatures</HI> in Africa—BUT EVERY OTHER KIND, in EVERY OTHER PLACE. Views, therefore, of FREEDOM and BONDAGE, throughout the different parts of the globe, have been taken, as well from experience, as the best historical evidence.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="4"/>In the order of my Poem on SOCIETY, perhaps the part which relates to the Inhuman <HI>Treatment</HI> of Negroes (for the <HI>Treat∣ment</HI> appears to me more criminal than the <HI>Traffic</HI>) might not have taken the lead; not from any idea that these unhappy Be∣ings are less entitled to the Rights of Nature, or the Regulations of Society, then any other parts of the HUMAN SPECIES; but, because, according to the series I meant to observe, the Prospect of the quarter of the Globe where this Trade principally subsists, would have been out of time and place. This objection being done away by the emulative Benevolence which is now excited in the Empire on this subject, it affords me the greatest pleasure that, by an <HI>anticipation</HI> of so much of what I had to remark on AFRICA as is confined to the Slave Trade (which, however, by no means exhausts what remains <HI>yet</HI> to be said in that division of my future work) I have a fair opportunity, and at a seasonable moment, to enforce the appeals of those who have the strongest claims on HUMANITY, in a performance devoted to its <HI>general</HI> interests.</P>
<P>How far the <HI>entire Abolition,</HI> so warmly contended for by the supporters of this measure, may be consistent with human policy, it is not my purpose particularly to enquire. It is not the <HI>name</HI> of Slave in <HI>itself,</HI> which produces the great mis∣chief. An hired servant in Eu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ope may be as little at his own command, and destined to as hard labour as a purchased Negro in Africa; but the essential difference consists in the one being guarded by the laws of the land, which spread before his person and his property a shield that defends him from every <HI>abuse of power;</HI> and the other is left naked and defenceles to the "inso∣lence of office."</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="5"/>HUMANITY requires that the RIGHTS OF NATURE should be enjoyed by every <HI>Human Being.</HI> It is therefore against the shock∣ing barbarity, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I am glad, however, to have it in my power to observe, that we have not suffered the HUMANITY of the French and other nations to surpass our own, at least in <HI>one</HI> of our islands, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the following authentic extract from the Jamaica Councils will attest, dated <HI>November</HI> 20th, 1787.</P>
<P>"This day the House of Assembly went into a Committee on the Consolidated Slave Bill, and continued sitting upwards of three hours; we understand, that by this Bill the whole system of the law respecting Negroes, is entirely changed, a Council of Protection is estab∣lished in each parish, and many humane provisions are introduced for rendering their con∣dition easy and happy; it is also made felony, without benefit of clergy, to murder a Slave, a clause, which, to the great honour of the House, passed without a single dissenting voice.</P></NOTE> the unquestionable cruelty, and the too well-attest∣ed horror, growing out of these, that I contend.—An abolition of <HI>these enormities</HI> is absolutely necessary. For the rest, whether the commerce flourishes or falls, is a matter of no moment to the Philanthropist: without engaging in the heats of political contro∣versy; without attending to the pleas of interest on the one side, or the sallies of enthusiastic zeal (though generous in its excesses) on the other, it is sufficient to Him that the happiness of the <HI>species</HI> in <HI>general,</HI> is made independent on the tyranny of <HI>particu∣lar individuals,</HI>—that the laws of <HI>subordination,</HI> in the different classes of SOCIETY, should not violate the laws of <HI>humanity,</HI>—and that so much of <HI>liberty</HI> should be allowed to every man, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to feel a consciousness of his being a link in the great chain of the community; and that till by some act of his own it is necessary for the <HI>good of the whole</HI> that he should be considered as an outcast of society, he is, by the Rights of nature and of Rea∣son, entitled to protection from insult, misery and death.—So far as the <HI>wealth,</HI> can be reconciled to the <HI>happiness,</HI> of nations, and the Establishments of Civil <HI>Society</HI> to the Rights of Nature,
<PB N="iv" REF="6"/>every lover of his country must subscribe: at the fame time, as the <HI>wealth of worlds</HI> cannot justify the least wanton infraction of the <HI>laws of Humanity,</HI> whoever vainly attempts to support an argu∣ment for the one, at the expence of the other, erects a building which hath its foundation in the sands, and which must tumble into ruins at the slightest touch of Reason and of Truth.</P>
<P>Under this plain Conviction, I have felt and written, and shall continue to feel and write, upon <HI>Liberty</HI> and <HI>Slavery, Humanity</HI> and <HI>Nature;</HI> and I now submit my Sentiments to the candid, consider∣ation of the Public, without any undue considence of success, or unmanly dread of miscarriage.—I have not thrust upon the world, what I wish it to honour with notice, without the pre∣vious approbation of some great, and good minds; but (very contrary to the case with which in earlier life I used to reconcile myself to hasty publication) were I not now to go to press till I was <HI>satisfied with my own performance,</HI> those whose partiality disposes them to praise, would blame me for unreasonable delay; and those, who are more prone to censure, would no more be indebted to me for furnishing them with subject for the exercise of their favourite talent. On every great and national occasion, however, our country has a claim on the best services we have to offer; and wherever they fall short of our wishes, or even of our own conceptions, the proverbial apology, that the <Q>Intention sanctifies the Deed,</Q> ought to operate in our favour. Should the deed, in any measure, do justice to the intentions, in the <HI>present</HI> instance, applause will not be withheld, but it will only serve to animate my future exertions, to prove more deserving of it.</P>

<L>FROM vernal blooms and many a fragrant bow'r,</L>
<L>The red'ning blossom and unfolding flower,</L>
<L>From breezy mountains and the covert vale,</L>
<L>The gliding water and the whispering gale,</L>
<L>From gayer scenes where careless Fancy stray'd,</L>
<L>Bask'd in the sun, or frolick'd in the shade,</L>
<L>Ambitious grown, and touch'd by generous praise,</L>
<L>Now turns the MUSE to more advent'rous lays;</L>
<L>No more she paints the tints of blushing morn,</L>
<L>Nor hangs the dew-drop on the trembling thorn;</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="8"/>
No more the brook runs murmuring in her line,</L>
<L>No more fair Spring, her florid verse is thine;</L>
<L>Farewell, a long farewell, to founts and flow'rs,</L>
<L>Far loftier themes demand her thoughtful powers.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where'er, sublime SOCIETY expands,</L>
<L>By art or nature form'd, thy potent bands,</L>
<L>Thro' realms of heat, where faints th' expiring breeze,</L>
<L>Or piercing climes, where the sun seems to freeze;</L>
<L>In darksome caverns, on tremendous steeps,</L>
<L>Th' embow'ring forest, or the billowy deeps;</L>
<L>Where roars the gulph, or where the streamlets flow,</L>
<L>Or dazzling mountains rise of endless snow,</L>
<L>Soon shall she dare to wing the vast domain,</L>
<L>THY awful power the subject of her strain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But, ah! first kneeling at Compassion's shrine,</L>
<L>Her opening lay, HUMANITY, be thine!</L>
<L>For thou her guardian, patroness, and guide,</L>
<L>She owns with rapture, and obeys with pride!</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="9"/>
Thee she invokes, oh! soother of distress,</L>
<L>Who with our kindness wove our happiness;</L>
<L>For as thy circling virtues round us move,</L>
<L>From their best <HI>deeds</HI> thy brightest <HI>joys</HI> we prove;</L>
<L>Oft as our neighbour sinks in sudden grief,</L>
<L>Thou wak'st as sudden to afford relief.</L>
<L>Oft as the stranger's bosom heaves with sighs,</L>
<L>The soft responses in our bosoms rise:</L>
<L>The cries of terror and the throes of care,</L>
<L>The groan of misery, and distraction's glare,</L>
<L>Sickness that droops, disease that gasps for breath,</L>
<L>The howl of madness, and the shrieks of death,</L>
<L>Deep sounds of agony that most affright,</L>
<L>Dread views of horror that most blast the sight,</L>
<L>Dire as they are, like wond'rous magnets draw,</L>
<L>And own, HUMANITY, thy sacred law.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And oh! 'tis THINE, when vital breath seems fled,</L>
<L>To seek the awful confines of the dead;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="10"/>
Drag the pale victim from the whelming wave,</L>
<L>And snatch the body from the floating grave;</L>
<L>Beneath the billow, tho' entomb'd it lies,</L>
<L>Thy dauntless zeal the roaring main defies;</L>
<L>Inspir'd by HIM, whose hallow'd touch restor'd</L>
<L>The darling babe the widow's soul deplor'd,</L>
<L>Her matron bosom eas'd of dire alarms,</L>
<L>And gave the child to her despairing arms,</L>
<L>'Tis THINE to plunge into the bloating flood,</L>
<L>Clasp the swol'n frame and thaw the frozen blood;</L>
<L>Breathe in the lips reanimating fire,</L>
<L>Till warm'd to SECOND LIFE, the DROWN'D respire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hark! as those lips once more begin to move,</L>
<L>What sounds ascend of gratitude and love!</L>
<L>Now with the GREAT REDEEMER's praise they glow,</L>
<L>Then bless the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Promoters of that glorious Institution the HUMANE SOCIETY.</NOTE> agents of his power below;</L>
<L>New sprung to life, the renovated band,</L>
<L>Joyful before their second Saviours stand;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="11"/>
And oh far sweeter than the breathing spring,</L>
<L>Fairer than Paradise, the wreaths they bring!</L>
<L>The blissful homage rescu'd friends impart;</L>
<L>Th' enraptur'd incense of a parent's heart,</L>
<L>Oe'r-aw'd, and wond'ring at themselves, they see</L>
<L>And feel the power of soft HUMANITY!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When sovereign Reason from her throne is hurl'd,</L>
<L>And with her all the subject senses whirl'd,</L>
<L>From sweet HUMANITY, the nurse of grief,</L>
<L>Even <HI>thy</HI> deep woes, O PHRENZY! find relief;</L>
<L>For tho' the tresses loose and bosom bare,</L>
<L>And maniac glance thy hapless state declare,</L>
<L>With gentle hand <HI>she</HI> still supports thy head,</L>
<L>Beguiles thy wand'ring wit, and smoothes thy bed;</L>
<L>Assists thy roving fancy in its flight,</L>
<L>To crown thy airy sallies with delight;</L>
<L>An healing balm to thy warp'd sense she brings,</L>
<L>Till from her softness magic comfort springs,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="12"/>
And joys which reason with a frown denies,</L>
<L>Her tender pity with a smile supplies;</L>
<L>Ev'n in thy prison-house she bids thee draw</L>
<L>From the rush sceptre, and the crown of straw,</L>
<L>The mimic truncheon, and the love-knot true,</L>
<L>Full many a transport Reason never knew;</L>
<L>And at thy grated cell she oft appears,</L>
<L>She culls thee flowers, and bathes them with her tears;</L>
<L>The perfum'd violet and the blooming rose,</L>
<L>On thy hurt mind a transient bliss bestows;</L>
<L>Into a thousand shapes the garlands change,</L>
<L>As fairy fancy takes its antic range;</L>
<L>Then as thy brows the fragrant wreaths adorn,</L>
<L>The roses seem to bloom without a thorn.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet not to <HI>woes</HI> confin'd, for pleasure's song,</L>
<L>The reckless frolics of the village throng;</L>
<L>Ev'n as we pass them by in distant lands,</L>
<L>THOU mak'st our own, and oft we join the bands;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="13"/>
The sudden sounds of happiness we hail,</L>
<L>And swell the chorus echoing in the gale;</L>
<L>Gladly we pause, then blythe pursue our way,</L>
<L>While brighter sunshine seems to gild the day;</L>
<L>For from the jovial groupe as we depart,</L>
<L>THY richer sunshine beams upon the heart;</L>
<L>Thus bliss is doubled, and thus pain can warm,</L>
<L>From thee, HUMANITY, both boast a charm;</L>
<L>We chear, are chear'd, now grant and now receive,</L>
<L>And need, in turn, the comfort which we give.</L>
<L>Thus thy fair streams spread plenty where they run,</L>
<L>Yet bless the fountains whence those streams begun;</L>
<L>Like the rich NILE thy sources ne'er are dry,</L>
<L>Although a thousand channels they supply.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But Thou from whom these bosom'd comforts flow,</L>
<L>HUMANITY! thou friend to joy and woe,</L>
<L>Hast still ordain'd, that grief to crimes belong,</L>
<L>And that keen anguish shall attend on wrong;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="14"/>
Pride, hate, revenge, and tyranny, and strife,</L>
<L>As they mix poisons in the bowl of life,</L>
<L>Dash their <HI>own</HI> cup, and impotently try</L>
<L>To break, <HI>unpunish'd,</HI> nature's <HI>social tie:</HI></L>
<L>Good, is of good productive, ill, of ill,</L>
<L>Conscience o'er both exerts her empire still,</L>
<L>And this great truth shall ev'ry tyrant know,</L>
<L>THE WOE HE GIVES, SHALL BE REPAID BY WOE.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Is there a land where echoing Fame extends,</L>
<L>From her proud cliff to earth's remotest ends,</L>
<L>Where gently slop'd the teeming vales are seen,</L>
<L>Adorn'd like Eden's with eternal green,</L>
<L>Where ev'ry village glows with every wealth,</L>
<L>The showers are riches, and the breezes health;</L>
<L>Where the sun gives serene his temper'd ray,</L>

<L><PB N="109" REF="114"/>
Far as extend these parent floods they range,</L>
<L>Feel all at large and triumph in the change.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet mov'd by generous deeds their bosoms burn,</L>
<L>To merit freedom by a kind return,</L>
<L>Methinks I see them leave their native plain,</L>
<L>And touch'd by honour seek their lords again;</L>
<L>Methinks I see them, now no scourge is there,</L>
<L>In willing Tribes to scenes once curs'd repair,</L>
<L>Led on by gratitude they stoop to toil,</L>
<L>Double their industry, and bless the soil,</L>
<L>They quit the whizzing dart and twanging bow,</L>
<L>Collect the grass and reassume the Hoe,</L>
<L>Ev'n troops of sable Children brave the sea,</L>
<L>To kiss the hands which set their fathers free.</L>
<L>Blest expectation! here the MUSE shall pause</L>
<L>And watch, HUMANITY, thy righteous cause,</L>
<L>But soon again shall she the globe survey,</L>
<L>And dare the dangers of her <HI>promis'd</HI> lay,</L>
<L>While in procession pass the human race,</L>
<L>Shall boldly view each tinge of mind as face,</L>
<L><PB N="110" REF="115"/>
With curious eye the gradual change shall mark,</L>
<L>As wond'rous Nature shifts from light to dark,</L>
<L>Shall visit tribes beneath the polar skies,</L>
<L>Of shape uncouth, diminutive of size.</L>
<L>Pass to the Tartar of an Olive shade,</L>
<L>Untam'd, untutor'd, and robustly made;</L>
<L>Next move to Asia's dusky-tinctur'd race,</L>
<L>Of foster form, nor destitute of grace;</L>
<L>Then the swarth African and yellow Moor,</L>
<L>Which spread their sable hues along the shore,</L>
<L>Last, wild America's eventful clan,</L>
<L>And European cultur'd into Man.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>These to descry the Muse her course shall bend,</L>
<L>Far as discover'd earth and seas extend,</L>
<L>Thro' the wide universe shall vent'rous roam,</L>
<L>Nor till the Globe be measur'd seek her home.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But not content the surface to display,</L>
<L>Hues, habits, manners, customs to pourtray,</L>
<L><PB N="111" REF="116"/>
Her future song a bolder flight shall try,</L>
<L>And trace the magic powers of clime and sky,</L>
<L>Track Education, and Religion's hand,</L>
<L>And note the law that governs ev'ry land;</L>
<L>Observe, if Elements that cloud with strife,</L>
<L>Or smile in peace, most rule the springs of life;</L>
<L>See how from each, at work upon the mind,</L>
<L>Springs the diversity of Human Kind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next varying modes of LIBERTY survey,</L>
<L>From where she thrives to where she melts away,</L>
<L>Now proud to claim the independent soul,</L>
<L>Now her tame Spirit passive to controul,</L>
<L>For ever weak where tyranny assails,</L>
<L>For ever strong where milder rule prevails,</L>
<L>There like vile oxen stooping to the yoke,</L>
<L>Here gaining sudden freedom at a stroke.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Still will she find, compact in ev'ry part,</L>
<L>Is form'd the chain that fastens heart to heart,</L>
<L><PB N="112" REF="117"/>
Millions of links but all arrang'd are seen,</L>
<L>The rivets clos'd and not a chasm between;</L>
<L>And where they disproportion'd meet our eyes;</L>
<L>Or seem of different form, or different size,</L>
<L>Here, if more polish'd, there more rude they shew,</L>
<L>Or colour'd various as the show'ry bow,</L>
<L>Still one bright zone girds ocean, earth, and sky,</L>
<L>Thy beauteous zone, oh sweet HUMANITY!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Lo, the chain lengthens as the Links are plac'd,</L>
<L>Amid'st the flow'ry dale or barren waste,</L>
<L>Some with the whit'ning Billows froth around,</L>
<L>Some bathe in streams that never pass their bound,</L>
<L>Some redd'ning flame on Aetna's burning brow,</L>
<L>And some are cover'd with Siberian snow,</L>
<L>Some with th' brooding Mine in darkness hide,</L>
<L>And some in dazzling floods of light reside,</L>
<L>Some reach the clouded Regions of the North,</L>
<L>Where tawny Zembla pours her Children forth,</L>
<L>Some where keen Lapland bids the freezing train</L>
<L>Chase the fleet rein-deer o'er the icy plain;</L>
<L><PB N="113" REF="118"/>
Some stretch to milder climes remote from storms,</L>
<L>Where nature rises in her gentler forms,</L>
<L>Still, still thro' ev'ry clime may we behold</L>
<L>The chain but brightens as the links unfold,</L>
<L>Where'er dispers'd they spread to ev'ry soul,</L>
<L>And God, tis God alone that links the whole.</L>
<L>These shall the Muse with ardent wing explore,</L>
<L>Nor give, at fear's vain threat, th' enquiry o'er.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>An awful Task! yet hope the Lyre shall string</L>
<L>And aid the Muse to spread the daring wing.</L>
<L>Ye silken Bards repose in beds of flowers,</L>
<L>And in soft sonnets court the sylvan powers,</L>
<L>Neptune, Diana, Wave, or Wood-nymph woo,</L>
<L>Bid Thrushes sweeter sing, Doves fonder coo,</L>
<L>The lazy Poppy nodding o'er your Brows,</L>
<L>While at your feet the languid water flows</L>
<L>Silent along, as if afraid to creep,</L>
<L>Lest its unguarded lapse should rouse from sleep,</L>
<L>Ah, sweetly slumber, undisturb'd by sense,</L>
<L>Then gently wake to tuneful Indolence,</L>
<L><PB N="114" REF="119"/>
Crop the pale shrub that e'en in plucking dies,</L>
<L>But leave the plant that blossoms in the skies:</L>
<L>Nor rash, nor diffident, the Muse shall sweep</L>
<L>From Clime to Clime, and dare the giddy steep;</L>
<L>Still to the Sun aspiring, try the height</L>
<L>Cleave the dense air and hope to gain the light.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Mean time to soothe her speeds a generous throng,</L>
<L>To cheer her labour, and assist her song;</L>
<L>These, while she tries the unattempted way,</L>
<L>Shall bid her soar and animate her Lay;</L>
<L>And tho' the fiends who dread the Muse should rise,</L>
<L>With Serpent malice hiss her as she flies,</L>
<L>Full many a laurell'd Bard to Science dear</L>
<L>Compose her Terrors, and her Spirits cheer,</L>
<L>And while she droops beneath the growing Toil,</L>
<L>Her Song approve, and give th' inspiring smile.</L>
