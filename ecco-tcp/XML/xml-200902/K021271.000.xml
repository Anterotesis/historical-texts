<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE following little piece meeting with uncommon success, after having been withdrawn from the stage, it may be expected that the author will say some∣thing by way of apology for the scene, which in its former state was deemed ex∣ceptionable; it was almost a literal trans∣lation from the Poulet, a dramatic pro∣verb, and pronounced by men of unques∣tionable judgement an excellent situation; but nothing is so difficult to decide on with certainty, as the effect any incident will have in representation. Much as was thought of the Poulet in the closet, it was much disliked on the stage, and the piece consequently withdrawn for alteration. Fortunately for the author, he has suc∣ceeded in his second attempt to please, and the farce is once more in possession of the stage.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE><HI>Written by the</HI> AUTHOR,</BYLINE>
<SP>
<STAGE><HI>and spoken by</HI> Mr. LEE LEWES.</STAGE>
<L>STATESMEN and Poets, oft', one for∣tune find;</L>
<L>This Court being discontent, our Bard resign'd;</L>
<L>That is to say, resign'd as Courtiers mean,</L>
<L>He was turn'd out, but would come in again.</L>
<L>On one good point he's bent, a reformation,</L>
<L>And bade me tell this grand Association,</L>
<L>He now has made a total alteration.</L>
<L>M1stakingly, he built on Gallic ground,</L>
<L>But prov'd French wit was, like French faith, unsound;</L>
<L>Hence wiser grown, he's cautious in his views,</L>
<L>And makes no foreign compacts for his Muse.</L>
<L>On foreign aid 'tis hazardous reliance,</L>
<L>But certain ruin's in a French alliance.</L>
<L>By Gar, Monsieur will say, you m1stake quite,</L>
<L><HI>Mon Pais,</HI> my country, be <HI>toujours</HI> right;</L>
<L><HI>Il faut vous allor,</HI> you must go to France,</L>
<L>If you would learn to make <HI>bon alliance;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Par l'alliance Bourbon,</HI> we long trick you;</L>
<L><HI>Par l'alliance Amerique,</HI> trick dem too;</L>
<L><HI>Voila Monsieur d'Estaing,</HI> has he not play'd,</L>
<L>One pretty trick, in taking <HI>de Grenade?</HI></L>
<L>Is he not grand, invincible Hero?</L>
<L>Arrah, replies Teague, ask General Prevost!</L>
<L><PB N="vii" REF="5"/>So much with shot he bother'd him, they say,</L>
<L>He play'd an old French trick, and ran away,</L>
<L>Now home to France he's gone with broken thigh,</L>
<L>His leg being wounded, kays he came too nigh;</L>
<L>And, by St. Patrick, he deserv'd his fate,</L>
<L>Who wou'd not give the women a retraat;</L>
<L>Had but the Irish brigade been there,</L>
<L>They'd given their hearts before they'd hurt the fair.</L>
<L>But talk no more of Heroes—name me one,</L>
<L>Like the brave tar, who met the Spanish Don</L>
<L>Without a sword, and gave him up his own.</L>
<L>Oh! such a trick, with all your gasconade,</L>
<L>No French Monsieur, or Spaniard, ever play'd.</L>
<L>But, whilst for valour's crown great nations sight,</L>
<L>And wild Ambition takes the name of Right;</L>
<L>Ambiguous states, each diff'rent power to fleece,</L>
<L>Equal suspend the scale of war and peace;</L>
<L>Abjure all principle, but that they've lent,</L>
<L>And know no interest, but cent. per cent;</L>
<L>But, rouz'd by wrongs, the Genius of this land,</L>
<L>In self-collected might, more firm shall stand;</L>
<L>Hibernia's cause, and Britain's, now made one,</L>
<L>We boast a fam'ly compact of our own;</L>
<L>Defies the treach'rous compact of Bourbon.</L>
<L>Whilst Justice, as a flaming AEgis, throws</L>
<L>Confusion and dismay on England's foes;</L>
<L>Her thunder to the world shall speak again,</L>
<L>She reigns th' unshaken Sov'reign of the Main.</L>

<SPEAKER>MEADOWS.</SPEAKER>
<P>WAS there no possibility of bribing one of the servants?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CANTEEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>None in the world, Sir, which indeed surprized me, for tho' I must confess they have all good places, I have known folks with better, and in a greater man's service, who wou'd not let a bribe slip thro' their fingers for want of the trouble of clinching the f1st upon it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>MEADOWS.</SPEAKER>
<P>What shall I do, Canteen? you are an old campaigner, and should be ripe with stratagem in desperate cases!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CANTEEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have got a scheme to serve you, if you'll un∣dertake it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MEADOWS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can you doubt me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CANTEEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then be attentive: Old Wrongward's house, on the approaching wedding, is throng'd as a fair with company; dress yourself in the style of an elderly gentleman travelling the country; pretend to misapprehend ev'ry body; in short assume the character of a deaf man, and, thus disguised, put up at his house, as if you took it for an inn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MEADOWS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pho! Pho! I shall be taken before a Ma∣g1strate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CANTEEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not you, indeed, Sir; at all these public wed∣dings there are a great number of strangers, in∣vited by the chief guests; you'll pass as a friend to some of the company—But grant you are taken for the character you assume, an old, deaf, blundering blockhead; your m1stakes will create
<PB N="11" REF="9"/>so much entertainment, that nobody will think of turning you out of doors till you have full opportunity of discovering yourself to your m1stress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MEADOWS.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do you think she'll l1sten to me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CANTEEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm sure of it, Sir; I'd stake my life to a car∣touch box, that your letters from camp have been intercepted, and some damn'd story trump'd up by that old villain her guardian, to make her marry his own son.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MEADOWS.</SPEAKER>
<P>It must be so, my Sophia otherwise could never have forgot me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CANTEEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>It must be so! Lord, Sir, if you were not so much in love, it would appear to you as plain as a pike-staff; but when once love gets into a man's head, poor reason is brought before a court-martial of the passions, and cashiered with∣out a hearing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MEADOWS.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it will be necessary to apprise Sophia of this, if I can by any means convey a letter to her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CANTEEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>A light breaks in upon me; I met a little flower girl standing at the inn-door, as fresh, and as
<PB N="12" REF="10"/>blooming as the sweetest rose in her basket— Don't you imagine a letter may be conveyed by her into the garrison?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MEADOWS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can we trust her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CANTEEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>She's as sure as a rifle barrel, Sir;—You know what a smooth tongue and a smart figure will do with a girl in the country; I have persuaded her, that I am over head and ears in love with her— and have swore, by the god of love, and the god of battles, that I'll make her Mrs. Canteen, if she pleases, before to-morrow morning.</P>
