<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THESE Two Volumes are composed from the XIVth and XVth of my OUTLINES OF THE GLOBE. I had many solicitations from private friends, and a few wishes from persons unknown delivered in the public prints, to commit to the press a part, in the form in which the post∣humous volumes might hereafter make their appearance. I might have pleaded the imprudence of the attempt, at my time of life, of beginning so arduous an undertaking in my 71st year. I happily, till very lately, had scarcely any ad∣monition of the advanced season. I plunged into the sea of troubles, and with my papers in one hand, made my way through the waves with the other, and brought them secure to land. This, alas! is senile boasting. I must submit to the judgment of the public, and learn from thence how far I am to be censured for so grievous an offence against the maxim of <HI>Aristotle,</HI> who fixes the decline of human abili∣ties to the 49th year. I ought to shudder when I consider
<PB N="ii" REF="5"/>the wear and tare of twenty-two years; and I feel shocked at the remark of the elegant <HI>Delaney,</HI> who observes,
<Q>that it is generally agreed among wise men, that few great attempts, at lest in the learned way, have ever been wisely undertaken and happily executed after that period!</Q> I cannot defend the wisdom: yet, from the good fortune of my life, I will attempt the execution.</P>
<P>It will be formed upon the model of my INTRODUCTION to the ARCTIC ZOOLOGY, imitating, as far as my talents will admit, the great examples left by the disciples of the LIN∣NAEAN school, and the solid writings of the liberal and com∣municative race of the <HI>hyperborean</HI> learned, fitted by cli∣mate to assiduous study, and to retain the immenseness of their knowlege, when acquired. The Torrid Zone gene∣rally enervates the body and mind. The divine particle melts away, and every idea is too often lost in irresistible indolence.</P>
<P>Yet there are two writers, to whom I must own the highest obligations, who felt no degeneracy by the influence of climate. Their thoughts are as firm and collected as if they had been braced by the steady frost of the north.</P>
<P>The first is <HI>James Rennel</HI> Esquire, late Major of Engi∣neers and Surveyor General in <HI>Bengal.</HI> The effects of his
<PB N="iii" REF="6"/>labors, more immediately applied to the national service, have been productive of others, which have proved the brightest elucidations of a country, till after the year 1757, little more than the object of conquest, and now and then,— rarely indeed, of sordid adventure. Mr. <HI>Rennel</HI>'s Map of <HI>Hindoostan,</HI> or the <HI>Mogul</HI> Empire, and the attendant Me∣moir, are unparalleled convictions of the accuracy of the author in the study of geography, in which no rival dare dispute the palm of merit. I cannot express the obligations my present Work is under to his labors. I understand that there is another of the same nature, but far more extensive— perhaps in the press—every success attend the labors of his pen.</P>
<Q><L>I pede fausto,</L>
<L>Grandia laturus meritorum praemia—</L></Q>
<P>The other writer I allude to is the celebrated Sir WIL∣LIAM JONES. The subjects of that true genius were fa∣vored by APOLLO himself, being as sublime and elegant as those over which that deity peculiarly presided. The SUN, whose character might melt away the powers of feeble Genii, served only to exalt his strength of mind, as its beams are feigned to give additional brilliancy to the diamond in its mine. The reader will not wonder that
<PB N="iv" REF="7"/>I make him so nearly the <HI>Alpha</HI> and <HI>Omega</HI> of this my labor. The various pen of my illustrious countryman ex∣celled in every science. <HI>Phoebus</HI> smiled on all his un∣dertakings, and he was saluted by the whole circle at∣tendant on the deity, as <HI>Gallus</HI> is said to have been of old: —A truer simile cannot be adduced.</P>
<Q>Utque vero PHOEBI Chorus surrexerit omnis!</Q>
<P>I must not be silent in respect to the labors of an∣other gentleman, who, notwithstanding he never visited <HI>Hindoostan,</HI> has written with uncommon success on the wonderful mythology of the <HI>Hindoo</HI> religion, derived most happily the sources of many of its mysteries, and traced their origins, nearly lost in the mists of fable, from the sacred purity of HOLY WRIT. He has done the same by numbers of the abstrusest antiquities of the works of art; and that with a depth of learning and perspicuity rarely to be met with. But, alas! no CHOIR rises to salute the Re∣verend <HI>Thomas Maurice.</HI> This learned divine bends under the weight of <HI>honesta pauperies.</HI> That still voice which hurt-merit and conscious modesty cannot always suppress, is often drowned in the clamors of the undaunted throng, so as never to emerge into the notice of those whose
<PB N="v" REF="8"/>peculiar duty it is to search deeply into characters, be they in courts or choirs, and to put to flight the <HI>ignavum pecus,</HI> which are too frequently the pests of both,
<Q><L>Who, for their bellies sake,</L>
<L>Creep and intrude, and climb into the fold.</L>
<L>Of other care they little reck'ning make,</L>
<L>Than how to scramble at the shearers feast,</L>
<L>And shove away the worthy bidden guest!</L></Q></P>

<P>A YOGEY, or penitential <HI>Faquir.</HI> These classes devote themselves to varieties of most cruel austerities. <HI>Tavernier,</HI> at p. 166 of his travels in <HI>India,</HI> gives a plate of the various penances they inflict on them∣selves. They select a large Banian-tree, under which they astonish mankind with their strange distortions. These soon lose the use of some or other of their limbs, by their persisting in the most unnatural atti∣tudes. They are the most squalid of the order. They leave the hair of their head to grow far below their rumps, and the beards to an enor∣mous bushiness. They permit their nails to assume the form of talons, and often, by clasping their hands, suffer them to penetrate deep into the flesh.</P>
<P>The other figure is of a <HI>Pandaram,</HI> or <HI>Senassey,</HI> of the class of pilgrims to the various Pagodas, many of which are as eminent for their sanctity and miraculous powers as those of the most superstitious <HI>Europeans.</HI> These are from their active life stout and robust. They wear their hair short on the sides, and tied up in a knot on the top of their head. Their beards short and rough. Their manners are before related. Both these are <HI>Gymnosophists,</HI> or naked philosophers, but differ widely in their mo∣rals: the last go armed, often with the horns of the smooth-horned An∣telope,

<ITEM>Page 118. 1. 13.—<HI>M. de la Tour</HI> is the only historian who describes <HI>Ranna Biddelura</HI> in such exalted terms. Lieutenant <HI>Moor,</HI> in his <HI>Narrative,</HI> p. 51, mentions a place called <HI>Rana Bednore,</HI> which I presume to be the same; yet he speaks of it only 'as a market town of some importance and extent, with a fort, but not 'a strong one.' It is impossible that in the short interval between the time it was described by the <HI>Frenchman,</HI> and that in which it was visited by our honest soldier, that it could so suddenly decline from its magnificence as to suffer its uncommon splendor to pass without any notice. The place is expressed in Mr. <HI>Rennel</HI>'s Map of <HI>Hindoostan;</HI> and also in Mr. <HI>Moor</HI>'s, at the distance of about ninety miles to the north-east of <HI>Bednore,</HI> in Lat, 14°40″, East Long. 76°.</ITEM>

<P>SHOULD future readers have opportunity of perusing a printed copy of the MS. volume of the OUTLINES OF THE GLOBE, which treats of <HI>Arabia</HI> and <HI>Persia,</HI> they will find that we left behind the province of <HI>Sind,</HI> rent from the <HI>Hindoostan</HI> empire by the usurper <HI>Kouli Khan,</HI> who, as na∣ture seemed to have pointed out, made the mighty river of that name the boundary between the <HI>Persian</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> dominions.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Sind,</HI> or the <HI>Seindhoo</HI> of the <HI>Sanscrit,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE INDUS.</NOTE> was called by the antients, <HI>Indus,</HI> a name retained by the moderns. It rises from ten streams springing remote from each other, out of the <HI>Persian</HI> and <HI>Tartarian</HI> mountains, one of which originates in <HI>Cashmere.</HI> The rivers of the <HI>Panjab,</HI> and those which rise from the west above <HI>Candahar</HI> and <HI>Cabul,</HI> are the great contributory streams, but the parent one seems to be that which flows out of <HI>Cashgar,</HI> in Lat. 37° 10′ N. The name <HI>Sind</HI> is native, and of great antiquity, and mentioned by <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Arrian</HI> as the <HI>Indian</HI> appellative;
<PB N="2" REF="18"/>the one writes it <HI>Sindus,</HI> the other <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. We learn by the <HI>Nubian</HI> Geographer, that the <HI>Arabians</HI> call it <HI>Mehran.</HI> I mean to proceed down to its <HI>Delta,</HI> where it is discharged into the sea, and briefly point out the most remarkable places, antient or modern, which occur in my course.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Indus,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PENINSULA OF INDIA.</NOTE> or rather the streams which fall into it from the east, particularly the <HI>Ihylum</HI> or river of <HI>Cashmere,</HI> and the <HI>Ganges</HI> near <HI>Latak,</HI> in Little <HI>Thibet,</HI> to the north of <HI>Cashmere,</HI> approximate, and then run diverging till they reach the sea, and peninsulate the mighty empire, so that they give the name to <HI>Hindoostan,</HI> of the Peninsula of <HI>India. India</HI> or <HI>Hindoostan</HI> is not of vernacular derivation, antient as it is; the name <HI>Hind</HI> was given it by the <HI>Persians,</HI> who transmitted it to the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and they formed from it the word <HI>India;</HI> for we are assured by the scientific linguist Mr. <HI>Wilkins,</HI> that no such word is to be found in the <HI>Sanscrit</HI> Dictionary; for the aborigines of the country knew it by no other than that of <HI>Bharata</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rennel XX. and the attendant note.</NOTE>. The discovery is new, but we have preserved the antient name of <HI>Hindoostan,</HI> given it by the <HI>Persians,</HI> and that of <HI>India</HI> by the <HI>Grecians,</HI> who gave that of <HI>Hindoos</HI> to the aboriginal people of the country, and <HI>Stan</HI> a region.</P>
<P>THIS vast peninsula was formerly divided into two parts, <HI>Hindoostan</HI> Proper, which was bounded on the south by the rivers <HI>Nerbudda</HI> and <HI>Soane,</HI> and the southern borders of <HI>Bengal,</HI> and by the <HI>Barrampooter</HI> on the east.</P>
<P>THE other division is the <HI>Deccan,</HI> which signifies the <HI>south,</HI> and under that meaning comprehends all the rest of the penin∣sula, as far as Cape <HI>Comorin.</HI> This name and this division seem at present scarcely known, except in the mention of the great <HI>Soubahship,</HI> possessed by <HI>Nizam al Muluck</HI> and his successors.
<PB N="3" REF="19"/>This is now greatly altered in its limits, and abridged in its extent.</P>
<P><HI>Hindoostan</HI> tends to a conoid form. The northern part spreads into a large irregular base. <HI>Hurdwar,</HI> the most north∣ern place in the province of <HI>Delhi,</HI> is nearly in Lat. 30°, Long. 78° 15′. Cape <HI>Comorin</HI> is the most southern extremity, the point in Lat. 8°, Long. 77° 36′ 50″ E.

<P>IT is necessary to be observed, that <HI>India</HI> is bounded on the north by a range of most lofty mountains, rocky, and fre∣quently precipitous and inaccessible.

<HEAD>ANTIENT ROADS TO <HI>INDIA.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE earliest notice we have of commerce with this great empire, was in the book of <HI>Genesis,</HI> Ch. 37, where we find mention of the <HI>Ishmaelites</HI> carrying on a trade with <HI>Egypt,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PATRIARCHAL.</NOTE> in spices, balm, and myrrh; the two last might have been produc∣tions of <HI>Arabia,</HI> or of <HI>Gilead,</HI> but the spices were consined to <HI>India.</HI> They travelled at that time in caravans, and carried
<PB N="4" REF="20"/>their goods on the backs of camels in the very manner that their descendants the <HI>Arabs</HI> continue to do from that period. They took the same route as the patriarch <HI>Jacob</HI> did, and delivered their articles of luxury at the proud <HI>Memphis.</HI> As soon as they became a naval people, much of the commerce of <HI>Arabia,</HI> as well as of <HI>India,</HI> was conveyed to <HI>Muza</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">ARRIAN. Periplus, p. 152.</NOTE>, a port not remote from the modern <HI>Mocha,</HI> and from thence shipped to <HI>Berenice</HI> or to <HI>Myos hormos,</HI> and placed on the backs of camels, conveyed to the <HI>Egyptian</HI> markets. But in respect to the <HI>Ishmaelites</HI> who had met with <HI>Joseph</HI> and his brethren, it is highly probable, that it was prior to the time of their knowlege of navigation. They had therefore performed the whole jour∣ney to and from <HI>India</HI> by land. On their return they increased their caravan by the addition of the myrrh and balm, the pro∣duce of their own country, or of <HI>Gilead;</HI> which they had left not long before they met with the patriarchs at <HI>Dotham,</HI> a place in the middle of <HI>Palestine,</HI> not far to the west of the sea of <HI>Ti∣berias.</HI> They then proceeded on their journey to <HI>Egypt,</HI> with the addition of another article of commerce, a slave, in the person of <HI>Joseph,</HI> whom they had just purchased from his en∣vious brethren.</P>
<P>THIS communication with <HI>India</HI> was carried on for a great length of time. To use the authority of HOLY WRIT, our safest guide on all occasions, we find that SOLOMON gave it every en∣couragement. He founded <HI>Hamath</HI> in the country of <HI>Galilee,</HI> and <HI>Tadmor</HI> in the wilderness, or <HI>Palmyra,</HI> and many other <HI>cities of store</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">KINGS I. Ch. 9. V. 8, 119. CHRON. II. Ch. 8. V. 4.</NOTE>, or <HI>emporia,</HI> for the commerce of <HI>India,</HI> and <HI>Tyre, Sidon,</HI> and all the surrounding nations.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="21"/>I SHALL now mention the route for which the ancients were indebted to the <HI>Macedonian</HI> hero, who, after passing the <HI>paro∣pamisan Caucasus,</HI> founded a city on the south-east side of the <HI>Ghergistan</HI> mountains, or <HI>Hindoo Kho,</HI> or the <HI>Indian Caucasus,</HI> and called it <HI>Alexandria,</HI> in honor of himself.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ALEXANDRIA.</NOTE> <HI>Alexander</HI> passed this way in his pursuit of <HI>Bessus,</HI> and returned by the same road on his invasion of <HI>India.</HI> It is probable, that <HI>Alex∣andria</HI> was founded on the first expedition, in order to secure his return into a country, the conquest of which he had so much at heart. According to Mr. <HI>Rennel,</HI> it appears to have been in Lat. 34°, opposite to the modern <HI>Bamian,</HI> which stands on the north-west side of <HI>Caucasus.</HI> Here, according to <HI>Quintus Curtius,</HI> lib. vii. c. 3. he left seven thousand old <HI>Macedonian</HI> soldiers, and a number worn out in the service. <HI>Arrian,</HI> I. p. 230, says that he appointed <HI>Proexes,</HI> a noble <HI>Persian,</HI> Governor, and <HI>Niloxenus,</HI> Commissary of the army. <HI>Alexandria</HI> continued long an <HI>emporium</HI> of the goods of <HI>India,</HI> the termination of the commercial views of the <HI>Europeans,</HI> till it was superseded by the rise of <HI>Candahar,</HI> and <HI>Cabul.</HI> It seems to have had to it two roads; the one direct, and the same with the course taken by <HI>Alexander</HI> in his way from the <HI>Caspian</HI> sea to his pursuit of <HI>Bessus</HI> and his <HI>Indian</HI> conquest, through <HI>Aria,</HI> the modern <HI>Herat,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">HERAT.</NOTE> which was, till the latter ages, a place of great strength and great commercial note. In course of ages, it suffered all the calami∣ties to which the cities of the east are peculiarly incident; but it often emerged. <HI>Abdulkurreem</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A noble Cashmerian who attended Kouli Khan on his return from India. See p. 24 of his Memoirs.</NOTE> saw it in 1740, on his return, in a most distressful state: the very ground floors of the houses were ploughed up, and sown with grain; but he speaks
<PB N="6" REF="22"/>of the magnificent ruins, which shewed its former situation. The country was uncommonly rich, but the whole road from <HI>Candahar</HI> to this city, was a scene of desolation, marked by the march of <HI>Kouli Khan</HI> on his return from <HI>India.</HI> From <HI>Herat</HI> the ancients directed their course to the southern part of the <HI>Caspian</HI> sea. This journey must have been performed by caravans of camels or horses, as the road was destitute of navigable rivers. The route touched on the shore where <HI>Astrabad</HI> now stands, which, perhaps, was the port.</P>
<P>THE second way, and which was much frequented, was towards the north-west. The merchants went by <HI>Champan Drapsica,</HI> the modern <HI>Damian, Bactra,</HI> now called <HI>Zariaspa, Nautica</HI> the modern <HI>Nekebad,</HI> and from that town by a short stage to <HI>Maracunda</HI> or <HI>Samarcand,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SAMARCAND.</NOTE> seated in a most beautiful valley. All these cities rose, and were supported by the passage of the caravans. As to <HI>Samarcand,</HI> it had long been a vast city, known by the name of <HI>Maracunda.</HI> It was garrisoned by <HI>Alex∣ander</HI> the great, after the capture (at <HI>Nautica</HI>) of <HI>Bessus</HI> the murderer of <HI>Darius.</HI> The <HI>Scythians</HI> laid siege to it, but it was relieved by the <HI>Macedonian</HI> hero. It is said to have been, even then, a city of vast opulence, strength, and splendor.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>Samarcand</HI> the articles of commerce were conveyed to the <HI>Oxus,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE OXUS.</NOTE> the modern <HI>Amu,</HI> which runs at no great distance to the south. That famous river rises far to the south-east, in the <HI>Caucasan</HI> chain. It becomes navigable for barks at <HI>Termed,</HI> in Lat. 37° 30′ N. long before it comes near <HI>Samarcand;</HI> it is singular, that so distant a route should be pursued before the commodities were embarked. In the days of <HI>El Edrisi,</HI> or the <HI>Nubian</HI> Geographer (p. 138) we find that it was frequented on
<PB N="7" REF="23"/>that account; the Geographer mentions <HI>Termed</HI> among other stations near that great river. When the goods were shipped from <HI>Samarcand,</HI> they fell down the stream, which, in the time of <HI>Herodotus,</HI> passed through a marshy tract, the <HI>paludes excipientes araxem,</HI> now the <HI>Aral</HI> lake, out of which it flowed, and, going south-west, fell into the <HI>Caspian</HI> sea in the bay of <HI>Balchan.</HI> This passage has been destroyed above two centuries ago, and its ancient channel is scarcely to be traced. Master <HI>Anthonie Jenkinson,</HI> a most authentic traveller, gives the fol∣lowing account of the cause, in his travels into those parts in 1558, as related by <HI>Purchas,</HI> (see p. 236):
<Q>The water that serueth all that countrey, is drawne by ditches out of the river <HI>Oxus</HI> vnto the great destruction of the said river, for which cause, it falleth not into the <HI>Caspian</HI> sea, as it hath done in times past, and in short time all that land is like to be destroyed and to become a wildernesse for want of water, when the river of <HI>Oxus</HI> shall faile.</Q></P>
<P>I WILL now briefly enter on some other ways pointed out by the ancients as commercial routes into <HI>India.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">OTHER ROUTES.</NOTE> One is that mentioned by <HI>Pliny,</HI> (lib. vii. c. 17.) who probably speaks on good authority; his account is founded on intelligence delivered down by <HI>Pompey,</HI> when he was pursuing the <HI>mithri∣datic</HI> war. It was then certainly known, that it was but seven days journey out of <HI>India</HI> to the <HI>Bactryan</HI> country, even to the river <HI>Icarus,</HI> which runs into the <HI>Oxus,</HI> by means of which, the <HI>Indian</HI> commerce may be transported by the channel of the <HI>Caspian</HI> sea, and again by the river <HI>Cyrus,</HI> the modern <HI>Kur,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CASPIAN SEA.</NOTE> on the western side as far as <HI>Phasis,</HI> the <HI>Rione</HI> or modern <HI>Fasz,</HI> a large and navigable river, which falls into the head of the
<PB N="8" REF="24"/><HI>Euxine</HI> sea, and appears to me a communication of great practicability.</P>
<P>I MAY also mention <HI>Batnae,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BATNAE.</NOTE> a large commercial city, built, (according to <HI>Ammianus,</HI> lib. xiv. c. 3.) not remote from the <HI>Euphrates</HI> in <HI>Mesopotamia,</HI> by the <HI>Macedonians.</HI> It was filled with rich merchants; an annual fair was held there in the beginning of <HI>September,</HI> and it was then the resort of mul∣titudes of people, for the sake of the commodities brought from <HI>India,</HI> and even <HI>Seres</HI> or <HI>China,</HI> and various other places, both by land and water; the last, by the channel of the <HI>Persian</HI> gulph, and so up the <HI>Euphrates.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Seres</HI> reminds me of the last communication I shall mention,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE SERES.</NOTE> which was to the north, leading to the distant country of <HI>China.</HI> The <HI>Chinese</HI> merchants descended from their country, and leaving the head of the desert of <HI>Gobi</HI> to the west, reached little <HI>Bucharia,</HI> and got the conveniency of the river <HI>Ilak</HI> for part of their journey.</P>
<P>THE ancient <HI>Comedae,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">COMEDAE.</NOTE> the same with <HI>Cashgar,</HI> seated in Lat. 40° N. in the <HI>Casia Regio</HI> of <HI>Ptolemy,</HI> lay at the foot of mount <HI>Imaus.</HI> The <HI>Indian</HI> and <HI>Chinese</HI> trade carried on through this city, is still considerable. The river <HI>Sir,</HI> the old <HI>Iaxartes,</HI> is not far to the west of <HI>Cashgar,</HI> and might, by its falling into lake <HI>Aral,</HI> be an ancient channel of communication with the <HI>Caspian</HI> sea. This city was the rendezvous, even in early times, of the merchants trading with the country to the north and to the south. This, I dare suppose, was the
<Q><HI>receptaculum</HI> eorum qui ad <HI>Seras</HI> negotii causa prosisciuntur penes <HI>Imaum</HI> mon∣tem</Q> of <HI>Ptolemy;</HI> and near it, to the east, was the <HI>Lithinon
<PB N="9" REF="25"/>Purgon,</HI> and <HI>Turris Lapidea</HI> of <HI>Ammianus</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Shaw's Travels, p. 302.</NOTE>, which, by the name,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TURRIS LAPIDEA.</NOTE> could be no other than a beacon, sixed on a stone tower.</P>
<P><HI>Hierken,</HI> to the south of <HI>Cashgar,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">HIERKEN.</NOTE> was another celebrated mart, and is still the centre of commerce between the north of <HI>Asia, India, Thibet,</HI> and <HI>Sibiria.</HI> When the merchants reached the <HI>Indus,</HI> they fell into the tracts before described.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Seres,</HI> above spoken of, were the inhabitants of the north of <HI>China,</HI> remarkable for their silk, which the ancients believed was combed from the leaves of trees, and, when steeped in water, was corded and spun, and after their manner wove into a web. These <HI>Seres</HI> had some intercourse with the <HI>Romans;</HI> for <HI>Florus</HI> tells us that they sent ambassadors to <HI>Augustus,</HI> who were four years on their journey. They were a most gentle race, and shunned mankind: yet carried on a traffic, in the same manner as the western <HI>Moors</HI> do at present, with people they never see. The <HI>Moors</HI> go annually in caravans,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SINGULAR TRAFFIC.</NOTE> laden with trinkets, to an appointed place on the borders of <HI>Nigritia.</HI> There they find several heaps of gold deposited by the <HI>Negroes;</HI> against each of which the <HI>Moors</HI> put as many trinkets as they think of equal value, and then retire. If, the next morning, the <HI>Negroes</HI> approve the bargain, they take the trinkets and leave the gold; or else they make some deduction from the gold dust; and in this manner transact the exchange, without the lest instance of dishonesty on either part
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Tassy's Memoirs, p. 311. — Tassy's account is, that a commerce similar to this is carried on between a nation called the Cadensis and the Negroes. The Cadensis act as the middle man between them and the Tunisians, who go to their country, and obtain gold and negro slaves for European commodities.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="26"/><HI>Candahar,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CANDAHAR.</NOTE> seated in Lat. 33° o′ N. Long. 67° 15′ E. is the capital of a recent kingdom, formed by the convulsion given to this part of the eastern world. It was founded by <HI>Ahmed Abdalla,</HI> an <HI>Afghan</HI> prince, compelled by <HI>Kouli Khan</HI> to join his army in 1739. On the assassination of the tyrant, he ap∣peared again among his subjects, and added to his dominions <HI>Candahar, Cashmere,</HI> and some other small districts. His successors reside at <HI>Cabul;</HI> he has an army of two hundred thousand men, once clothed with <HI>British</HI> manufactures, which were sent up the <HI>Indus,</HI> and thence to <HI>Cabul</HI> by the lesser river.</P>
<P><HI>Candahar</HI> is a city of vast strength, by nature as well as art, being seated amidst fens and rocks. The Governor, <HI>Hossein Khan,</HI> defended it eighteen months against all the attacks of <HI>Kouli Khan.</HI> At length, reduced to extremity, he sallied out at the head of his men, and fell, bravely fighting in defence of his country!</P>
<P><HI>Candahar</HI> and <HI>Cabul</HI> were considered of high importance in a political light. The first was esteemed the gate of <HI>India</HI> in respect to <HI>Persia,</HI> and <HI>Cabul</HI> that in respect to <HI>Tartary,</HI> and both were in the middle ages the great <HI>emporia</HI> for <HI>Indian</HI> goods, which were transported into Western <HI>Tartary,</HI> and from thence by the <HI>Caspian</HI> and <HI>Euxine</HI> seas to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and from that city to all parts of <HI>Europe. Candahar</HI> was the magazine of the <HI>Indian</HI> and <HI>Persian</HI> goods, and <HI>Cabul</HI> of the spices. They were conveyed in caravans, north-westwards, to the famous city of <HI>Samarcand,</HI> in Lat. 40° N. and from thence the goods were put in boats, and sent down into the <HI>Oxus</HI> or <HI>Amu,</HI> which falls into the <HI>Caspian</HI> sea, as I have before related, and there shipped for their different destinations; those for <HI>Russia,</HI> up the <HI>Volga;</HI> those for <HI>Constantinople,</HI> up the river <HI>Cyrus,</HI> the modern <HI>Kur,</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="27"/>which descends a great and rapid river from mount <HI>Caucasus,</HI> and is navigable very far up, so as to form an easy communica∣tion with the <HI>Euxine</HI> sea. <HI>Venice</HI> and <HI>Genoa</HI> received the <HI>Indian</HI> luxuries from <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and their own port of <HI>Caffa,</HI> and dispersed them over the other parts of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>BOTH these cities continue the <HI>emporia</HI> of <HI>Persia, India, Tar∣tary,</HI> and all the circumjacent nations. The commerce is still considerable, notwithstanding it has been lessened by that of the <HI>European</HI> nations, who have established factories in almost every part of the <HI>Indian</HI> empire.</P>
<P><HI>Cabul</HI> is seated in Lat. 34° 36′ N. Long. 68° 58′ E.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CABUL.</NOTE> at the foot of the <HI>Indian Caucasus,</HI> and in so happy a climate, as to produce the fruits of both the temperate and torrid zones, notwithstand∣ing it is bordered by mountains capped with eternal snow. The <HI>Indian</HI> historians speak of it in the most rapturous terms. It stands on the river <HI>Kameh,</HI> which falls into the <HI>Indus</HI> at <HI>Attock,</HI> but possibly is interrupted by rapids, as it is only navigable by rafts.</P>
<P><HI>Cabul</HI> is the residence of the Kings of <HI>Candahar,</HI> and the present capital. The <HI>Nubian</HI> Geographer (p. 66.) speaks of <HI>Cabul</HI> as a noble city; that its mountains abounded with the sinest aromatic woods, <HI>Neregil</HI> and <HI>Myrobalans;</HI> the first may be <HI>Nellila Phylanthus emblica;</HI> the others the <HI>Spondias purpurea,</HI> &amp;c. All the <HI>Myrobalans</HI> had once a name in our shops as gentle purgatives; among other purposes they are used in the tanning business.</P>
<P>OF late days, <HI>Cabul</HI> has been noted for its vast fairs of horses and cattle; the first brought there by the <HI>Ushec Tartars.</HI> Slaves are also a considerable article of commerce. Merchants resort to these markets from <HI>Persia, China,</HI> and <HI>Tartary.</HI> It was taken
<PB N="12" REF="28"/>by <HI>Kouli Khan</HI> by storm, who put great part of the garrison to the sword, and made himself master of a vast treasure in arms, am∣munition, and jewels. <HI>Kouli Khan</HI> shewed here a strong specimen of oriental justice, by ripping up the bellies of eighty <HI>Kuzzlebash,</HI> or soldiers, for only being present when some of their comrades forced one of the country women.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Genoese,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CAFFA.</NOTE> those once enterprizing people, made them∣selves masters of <HI>Caffa,</HI> a noted city and port on the <HI>Euxine</HI> sea, in the famous peninsula of <HI>Krim Tartary.</HI> This they seized in 1261, and made the <HI>emporium</HI> of the commodities of <HI>India</HI> and <HI>Persia,</HI> which were brought down the <HI>Oxus,</HI> and the other routes mentioned in the preceding page. They colonized <HI>Caffa</HI> with their own countrymen, and gained prodigious wealth during the time they were in possession. It was wrested from them in 1475, by <HI>Mahomet</HI> the great, and with it soon expired the mighty power of that city of merchants. <HI>Genoa,</HI> for cen∣turies the rival of <HI>Venice,</HI> equally potent, and equally brave, waged long and fierce wars with each other, incited more by avarice, than the ambition of glory.</P>
<P><HI>Bochara,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOCHARA.</NOTE> not far to the south of <HI>Samarcand,</HI> was another great <HI>emporium,</HI> and communicated the eastern articles to all the neighbouring parts of <HI>Tartary.</HI> It traded with <HI>India, China,</HI> and <HI>Persia,</HI> and partook of those of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> by the caravans which went from that empire to <HI>Cathay.</HI> This city seems to have been of more modern date: it is not mentioned, as far as I recollect, before the days of the <HI>Nubian</HI> Geographer, who wrote some time prior to the year 1151, but it appears to have been in the next century a most flourishing place.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="29"/><HI>Anthonie Jenkinson (Purchas,</HI> iii. 241.) gives a very curious account of the state of <HI>Bochara</HI> and its commerce, as it was in the year 1558. This has been uninterruptedly continued from the earliest time to the present, for the northern parts of <HI>Asia</HI> have their wants and luxuries to supply even from <HI>India</HI> and <HI>China.</HI> The discovery of the passage by the Cape of <HI>Good Hope,</HI> gave a great check to this inland commerce. No more com∣modities were conveyed that way to the greatest part of <HI>Europe,</HI> yet still the trade is very considerable to the places I mentioned, and even to the <HI>Russian</HI> empire. <HI>Catherine</HI> has, as yet, no share in <HI>Hindoostan,</HI> no <HI>Indian</HI> fleets; her splendid courts, and all the luxuries of her vast cities are supplied either from <HI>Astra∣kan,</HI> or from the other <HI>Caspian</HI> ports; <HI>Astrakan</HI> is the great <HI>Russian</HI> staple of the <HI>Indian</HI> commerce. <HI>Gurjef</HI> and <HI>Kislar</HI> are the same. <HI>Persia</HI> has its <HI>Derbend, Niezabad, Baku,</HI> and others. The <HI>Tartars</HI> have their bay of <HI>Balchan</HI> and <HI>Mangushlak,</HI> through which, <HI>Bochara</HI> still pours its <HI>Indian</HI> articles of commerce. It is foreign to the plan of <HI>out-line</HI> to enter into <HI>minutiae.</HI> I must therefore refer to the second Volume of my friend the Reverend <HI>Wm. Coxe</HI>'s valuable Travels. The 4th Chapter will satisfy the most ardent curiosity.</P>
<P>In respect to the antient <HI>Russian</HI> commerce with these distant parts,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">RUSSIAN COM∣MERCE.</NOTE> I shall conclude the subject with observing, that after the various commodities of <HI>India</HI> had arrived through the channel of the <HI>Oxus</HI> into the <HI>Caspian</HI> sea, they were shipped for the <HI>Volga,</HI> the <HI>Rha</HI> of the antients. That river was so little known to the antients, that they have not left us the name of a single place in its whole course. The merchants ascended that great river. After navigating it a very considerable way they entered
<PB N="14" REF="30"/>the <HI>Kama,</HI> and arrived through the <HI>Kokra</HI> at <HI>Tcherdyn,</HI> seated in Lat. 60° 25′ North, in those early times a mighty <HI>emporium.</HI> From thence the several eastern articles of commerce were dis∣persed over all the <HI>arctic</HI> regions. The <HI>Nortmans</HI> and the <HI>Sue∣ons,</HI> people of the <HI>Baltic,</HI> had great intercourse with them through the <HI>Nova,</HI> and <HI>Ladoga,</HI> another vast <HI>emporium,</HI> seated on the lake of the same name. As a proof of the antiquity of its commerce, coins of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> of <HI>Syria</HI> and <HI>Arabia,</HI> have been found in the antient burying places, evidences that the people of the east and of the west had met there to supply their several wants; even at <HI>Tcherdyn,</HI> coins of the <HI>Arabian Caliphs</HI> have been discovered. Notwithstanding the immense wealth of both <HI>Tcherdyn</HI> and <HI>Ladoga,</HI> scarcely a trace is to be seen of those great <HI>emporia.</HI> The commerce of the first ex∣tended even within the <HI>artic</HI> circle. The <HI>Beormas,</HI> the people of the old <HI>Permia,</HI> ascended the <HI>Petzora</HI> with their furs, ex∣changed them for the products of the torrid zones, and fall∣ing down that northern river dispersed them over all their chilly regions.</P>

<PB N="16" REF="32"/>by an unexpected panic of the garrison. M. <HI>D'Anville</HI> sup∣poses it to have been the modern <HI>Renas,</HI> situated in about Lat. 38° North. Our countryman, the gallant Captain <HI>John Jones,</HI> in 1773, mastered by open storm <HI>Dellamcotta,</HI> a fort equally strong, and seated in a manner equally singular amidst the <HI>Boutan</HI> mountains.</P>

<P><HI>Taxila</HI> stood on,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TAXILA.</NOTE> or near the spot, where the city <HI>Attock</HI> now stands. Here <HI>Alexander</HI> crossed the <HI>Indus</HI> on a bridge of boats, which his favorite <HI>Hephestion</HI> had some time before been sent to prepare. In 1398 the famous <HI>Timur Beg,</HI> or <HI>Tamerlane,</HI> passed this river on one of the same kind. In our days <HI>Kouli
<PB N="17" REF="33"/>Khan</HI> (who may complete the sanguinary triumvirate) crossed the <HI>Indus</HI> at <HI>Attock</HI> in the same manner. This, by reason of the great rapidity of the stream in all other parts, was fixed on as the most convenient place, which long after induced the em∣peror <HI>Akbar</HI> to build the castle of <HI>Attock</HI> for its defence against similar invasions.</P>
<P>OPPOSITE to <HI>Attock</HI> stood a very antient city, the <HI>Nilaube</HI> of <HI>Ptolemy.</HI> This place is mentioned by two of the oriental his∣torians, quoted by Major <HI>Rennel,</HI> p. 95, under the name of <HI>Ni∣lab,</HI> by which the river <HI>Indus</HI> itself was generally known by the old writers

<P><HI>Alexander,</HI> after succeding in his passage,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PANJAB.</NOTE> got clear of the mountains, and arrived in the rich plains of <HI>Panjab,</HI> or the <HI>Five Rivers,</HI> each immortalized by being a great scene of action of the <HI>Macedonian</HI> hero. The <HI>Hydaspes,</HI> the modern <HI>Behut,</HI> or <HI>Chelum;</HI> the <HI>Acesines</HI> or <HI>Jenaub,</HI> or <HI>Cheenaub,</HI> and the <HI>Hydraotes,</HI> or mo∣dern <HI>Rauvee;</HI> all which, after a long course, unite in one chan∣nel, which retains the name of <HI>Cheenaub,</HI> and after the junction, passes through the country of the <HI>Oxydracae,</HI> beneath the north side of <HI>Moultan,</HI> and at the distance of about twenty miles from that city, falls into the <HI>Indus</HI> about two hundred miles below <HI>Attock,</HI> in magnitude equal to the <HI>Indus</HI> itself.</P>
<P>ON the banks of the <HI>Hydraotes</HI> stood the city of the <HI>Malli,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MALLI.</NOTE> who with the <HI>Oxydracae,</HI> after a most gallant resistance, made submission to <HI>Alexander.</HI> In the same neighborhood stood (the site now unknown) <HI>Sangala,</HI> inhabited by the <HI>Cathaei</HI> of <HI>Arrian,</HI> ii. 357, 364, <HI>Exped.

<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lib. xvii. c. 10.</NOTE>.
<PB N="18" REF="34"/>They are supposed to have been the same with the valiant cast the <HI>Khatre,</HI> to this day renowned for their desperate valour. <HI>Alex∣ander</HI> besieged them in their city: their defence was brave and obstinate: but they fell before the fortune of the <HI>Macedonian</HI> hero, who destroyed the nation, and levelled their city with the ground. A nameless city, as Mr. <HI>Rennel</HI> styles it, was to be found higher up the river, on the opposite side. This deserved to have been immortalized, as having been the place where that hero endangered his life by one of the rash actions he was very subject to fall into.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ALEXANDER WOUNDED.</NOTE> He leaped into the city, was beset by enemies, and received a desperate wound in his side by an arrow, which had transfixed his breastplate. He fainted, but recovered the moment he felt an <HI>Indian</HI> going to strip him, and drawing a dagger pierced his assailant to the heart. I leave the reader to consult <HI>Arrian, Exped. Alex.</HI> i. 396, about the event; and Mr. <HI>Rennel,</HI> p. 128, as to reasons for fixing the site of the momentous affair in the place he does, about ten miles above the conflux of the two rivers.</P>
<P>GOLD is found in some of the rivers of <HI>Panjab.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">GOLD.</NOTE> In respect to gold, we are informed by <HI>Herodotus,</HI> THALIA, c. 95, that the <HI>Indians</HI> paid their tribute to <HI>Darius</HI> in that pretious metal; and tells us, that it is procured out of the rivers, and also dug out of the earth, and smelted by them into ingots before they make with it their donative. One of the epithets the Poets bestow on the <HI>Hydaspes</HI> is <HI>Aurifer,</HI> possibly as being peculiarly rich in gold. <HI>Herodotus, Thalia,</HI> c. 102, relates, and seems to credit, the strange story of its particles being thrown up with the sand of the vast desert, probably that of <HI>Registan,</HI> by ants as big as foxes, and that the <HI>Indians</HI> went with three camels to collect the grains which
<PB N="19" REF="35"/>they found in the hillocks. As soon as they had filled their bags, they returned with all possible expedition to avoid the fury of the ants, which pursued them with incredible swiftness. It is reasonable to suppose, that the historian had heard of the mon∣strous nests of the <HI>Termites,</HI> or <HI>white Ants,</HI> which his informants thought proper to stock with most monstrous inhabitants.</P>
<P>ON the banks of the <HI>Hydaspes</HI> was fought the decisive battle between <HI>Alexander</HI> and the <HI>Indian</HI> monarch <HI>Porus,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BATTLE WITH PORUS.</NOTE> both equal in valour; but the former, by his great superiority in the art of war, obtained a complete victory with a handful of men. <HI>Porus</HI> employed not fewer than two hundred elephants, which, terrific as they might have been to the <HI>Macedonian</HI> horses, were, with their garrisoned towers, totally destroyed by the victorious army.</P>
<P>I CANNOT resist the introduction into this place of the fol∣lowing curious anecdotes of the two famous Monarchs,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PERSIAN HIS∣TORY OF.</NOTE>, as com∣municated to me by Major <HI>Ouseley,</HI> the ingenious author of the <HI>Persian</HI> miscellanies. He informs me, that two <HI>Persian</HI> writers mention the invasion of <HI>Hindoostan</HI> by <HI>Alexander</HI> the great. <HI>Fer∣dusi</HI> in his <HI>Shah Nameh,</HI> or Chronicle of Kings, written about the latter end of the 10th century and beginning of the 11th.; and <HI>Nezami,</HI> another celebrated poet, who flourished in the 12th. The first enumerates the various troops of <HI>Persia, Greece,</HI> and <HI>India,</HI> and the camel loads of presents which <HI>Alexander</HI> re∣ceived from <HI>Keid,</HI> the <HI>Indian</HI> Prince. <HI>Nezami,</HI> in his <HI>Skander Nameh,</HI> or History of <HI>Alexander,</HI> says, that forty elephants were loaden with the various productions of the country, among which several carried <HI>Indian</HI> steel. <HI>Porus</HI> is mentioned under the name of <HI>Four.</HI> The poet adds, he brought two thousand elephants into the field; which, by a contrivance of <HI>Aristotle (Alexander</HI>'s Secretary) were completely routed, and <HI>Four</HI> him∣self
<PB N="20" REF="36"/>killed by <HI>Alexander,</HI> who found in his castle of <HI>Canooge</HI> immense treasures!</P>
<P>ON the banks of this river,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NICOEA, AND BUCEPHALA.</NOTE> opposite to each other, he built, on the bloody scene, two cities, <HI>Nicoea</HI> and <HI>Bucephala. Nicoea</HI> so named from the victory, the last in honor of his celebrated horse, which died of old age at the time of this action. <HI>Alex∣ander</HI> gratefully paid it the highest funeral honors, erected a magnificent sepulchre, and called the city after its name.</P>
<P>I SHALL not trace the sieges, battles, and slaughters of this ambitious character; of his marches and his passages over the rivers that form this part of the <HI>Panjab,</HI> but leave my readers to consult his original historians, <HI>Arrian</HI> and <HI>Quintus Curtius.</HI> It is very certain the hero did not, amidst his deeds of arms, neglect the study of natural history. It is well known that he caused every species, objects of that science, to be collected for the use of his Tutor <HI>Aristotle. Q. Curtius</HI> relates some few re∣marks on the <HI>zoology</HI> of the neighborhood. He met here with the <HI>Rhinoceros,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">RHINOCEROS, &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE> with the great Serpent <HI>Boa constrictor, Gm. Lin.</HI> iii. 1083, with parrots, or birds which could speak, and with great flocks of wild peacocks. <HI>Aelian,</HI> in his <HI>Hist. An.</HI> lib. v. c. 21. relates, that the conqueror was so struck with their beauty, that he forbad his soldiers from killing them under the heaviest penalties.</P>
<P><HI>Psittacus</HI> is a name derived from <HI>Sillace,</HI> the <HI>Indian</HI> word for a parrot. <HI>Linnaus, Gm. Linn.</HI> i. 321, gives to one species, long known, the trivial of the <HI>Maccdonian</HI> hero, <HI>Psittacus Alexandri,</HI> as if in honor of the species discovered by his admiral <HI>Nearchus.</HI></P>
<P>THE same great officer mentions also the vast spotted serpents,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE BOA.</NOTE> which he says were about sixteen cubits long. <HI>Arrian,</HI> i. 538, <HI>Rev. Indic.</HI> His veracity has been called in question; but since
<PB N="21" REF="37"/>the <HI>Aristotelian</HI> cubit is little more than an <HI>English</HI> foot and a half, we may give full credit to his having seen a serpent of the length he gives, or one of twenty-four feet. The antients are often abused for their credulity: but let me remark, that incredulity is more frequently the offspring of ignorance than the former! At this time instances may be adduced of species from twenty to thirty-six feet in length, in <HI>Hindoostan, Ceylon, Java,</HI> and se∣veral other islands. <HI>Bontius,</HI> p. 76. a most respectable writer, bears witness to the existence of some of thirty-six feet being found in <HI>Java.</HI></P>
<P>AMONG the trees the <HI>Ficus Indica,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">FICUS INDICA.</NOTE> the <HI>Varinga Latifolia</HI> of <HI>Rumphius,</HI> could not fail engaging his attention, which formed a grove of itself, by the rooting of its pendulous branches.</P>
<P>THE mountains bordering on the <HI>Hydaspes</HI> were part of the <HI>Cachemerian</HI> chain, clothed with forests of trees of vast height and size. He committed to the care of certain officers the fall∣ing the timber, and floating it down the river to the place he had appointed for the rendezvous of the vessels, which he had used in his expeditions up the other rivers. At this place, which was between the forks of the <HI>Indus</HI> and <HI>Acesines,</HI> he founded another <HI>Alexandria,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ANOTHER ALEX∣ANDRIA.</NOTE> and there formed his docks and ship yard. He built several new ships, rebuilt and repaired others, and with a fleet which consisted of eighty <HI>Triremes,</HI> or ships with three banks of oars, and with lesser vessels, probably collected from the several rivers of the country, in all amounting to two thousand of different kinds, he fell down the <HI>Hydaspes.</HI> On his arrival at the junction of that river with the <HI>Acesines</HI> (which preserves its name till it is lost in the greater river) his navy underwent the utmost danger by the violent collision of the two waters. Several
<PB N="22" REF="38"/>of his ships were dashed to pieces, and himself, and his admiral <HI>Nearchus,</HI> with difficulty escaped. The sides and channel are filled with rocks, and <HI>Alexander,</HI> through ignorance of the climate of <HI>India,</HI> undertook his expedition in the rainy season, which, besides the swelling of the rivers (which impeded his march) made dreadful havoke among his troops by the diseases of the country.</P>
<P>THE other two rivers, which complete the <HI>Panjab,</HI> are the <HI>Beyah,</HI> once the <HI>Beypasha,</HI> and the <HI>Hyphasis</HI> of <HI>Alexander.</HI> The fifth and last is the <HI>Setlege</HI> or <HI>Suttuluz,</HI> the <HI>Zaradruz</HI> of <HI>Ptolemy,</HI> and <HI>Hesudrus</HI> of <HI>Pliny.</HI> These rise in the mountains that divide <HI>Thibet</HI> from <HI>India,</HI> and unite near <HI>Firosepour.</HI> Soon after which they divide, and insulate a pretty considerable tract into several islands; then re-unite, and, turning southerly, fall into the <HI>Indus</HI> fifty-three miles below the mouth of the <HI>Chenaub,</HI> according to Mr. <HI>Rennel</HI>'s great map. Between the insulated part and the <HI>Hydraotes,</HI> was the seat of the <HI>Malli</HI> and the <HI>Catheri,</HI> objects of the destructive ambition of <HI>Alexander,</HI> who, in his expedition against those people, seemed more intent on slaughter than useful conquest. It was on the banks of the <HI>Hyphasis,</HI> says <HI>Quintius Curtius,</HI> that the hero joined his forces with those of <HI>Hephestion,</HI> after each had performed some bloody exploit. Here he concluded his expedition; and after the display of his vanity, by erecting twelve altars near the junction of the <HI>Hyphasis</HI> and <HI>Hesudrus,</HI> commenced his voyage down the <HI>Indus.</HI> The altars were equal in height to the loftiest towers of war. On these he performed sacrisices after the manner of his country. He then entertained the <HI>Indians</HI> with athletic and equestrian games, and concluded with investing the vanquished <HI>Porus</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="39"/>with the sovereignty of the whole country, as far as the <HI>Hyphasis.</HI></P>
<P>DURING his stay in these parts, he founded another <HI>Alexan∣dria,</HI> between the forks of the <HI>Indus</HI> and <HI>Acesines.</HI> The modern name of the place seems, by Mr. <HI>Rennel</HI>'s map, to be <HI>Veh.</HI></P>
<P>IT does not appear that ever he saw the <HI>Hesudrus,</HI> which, according to <HI>Pliny,</HI> was a discovery of <HI>Seleucus Nicator,</HI> one of his ablest officers, and his successor in part of his dominions, and particularly of those between the <HI>Euphrates</HI> and the <HI>Indus:</HI> He seems to have succeeded also to the ambition of his master, for he meditated the conquest of <HI>India,</HI> or at lest of re-conquering those provinces beyond the <HI>Indus</HI> subdued by <HI>Alexander,</HI> but which, soon after his retreat, were recovered by <HI>Sandracotta,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SANDRACOTTA.</NOTE> an <HI>Indian</HI> of mean birth, but who, by his abilities, had rendered himself master of all <HI>India. Seleucus</HI> found this new monarch so very powerful, that he did not venture to attack him. He entered into a treaty with him, and agreed to retire, on con∣dition <HI>Sandracotta</HI> would supply him with five hundred ele∣phants; and thus covered his disgrace with a specious pretence.</P>
<P><HI>Alexander</HI> began his voyage down the <HI>Indus</HI> about the end of the month of <HI>October,</HI> and was nine months in the com∣pletion; not from the difficulty of navigation, for it might have been performed in a very short time, but from his ambitious rage of conquest and slaughter on each side of the river. His army marched, divided in two parts, on the eastern and western banks, ready to execute his orders, attended by his vast fleet.</P>
<P>ONE motive to this voyage was a suspicion <HI>Alexander</HI> had entertained, that he had found out the head of the <HI>Nile,</HI> and
<PB N="24" REF="40"/>that this was no other than the celebrated river of <HI>Egypt,</HI> be∣cause he saw in it crocodiles and beans, the <HI>Nymphoea Nelumbo</HI> of <HI>Linnaeus,</HI> similar to those of that kingdom. <HI>Arrian</HI> adds, that <HI>Alexander</HI> had even written to his mother an account of his discovery.</P>
<P>IN our way down the stream, we find among the <HI>Sogdi,</HI> another <HI>Alexandria,</HI> founded on the site of the royal residence of their monarch, the modern <HI>Bekhor</HI> or <HI>Bakhor,</HI> in Lat. 27° 12″.</P>
<P>WE afterwards come down to <HI>Sindomana,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SINDOMANA.</NOTE> the capital of the <HI>Sindomanni;</HI> possibly it took the name from the tract being pos∣sessed of a considerable manufactory of <HI>Sindones,</HI> or fine cloths;
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> being the name applied to certain kinds, the produce of the <HI>Indian</HI> looms. I must not call them linens, for I understand that <HI>India</HI> produces no sort of <HI>Linum</HI> or flax. It appears by <HI>Arrian,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MUSICANUS.</NOTE> to have been in the dominions of a prince called <HI>Musi∣canus,</HI> and that it opened its gates to <HI>Alexander</HI> on his passage down the <HI>Indus. Musicanus</HI> had deserted that hero, who caused him to be crucified, and all the <HI>Brachmins</HI> he could find to be put to death, as our <HI>Edward</HI> I. did the <HI>Welsh</HI> bards for the same reason, supposing the enthusiastic songs of both to have in∣spired their countrymen to the defence of their country against the ambitious invaders.</P>
<P>THE next antient place of note is the <HI>Prasiane insula</HI> of <HI>Pliny,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PRASIANE INSULA.</NOTE> formed by the dividing of the <HI>Indus.</HI> About twelve miles below, stood <HI>Mansura,</HI> a city mentioned by the <HI>Nubian</HI> Geogra∣pher, p. 57. That town was the ancient <HI>Minnagara</HI> of <HI>Arrian,</HI> ii. 163. <HI>Mar. Eryth.</HI> Its port was the <HI>Barbaricum emporium</HI> of the same,

<P>LET me here mention,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">INDO SCY∣THIA.</NOTE> that all the lower and middle parts of the western boundary of the <HI>Indus,</HI> went by the name of <HI>Indo Scythia.</HI> The <HI>Scythians,</HI> chiefly the <HI>Getae,</HI> had expelled the <HI>Greeks,</HI> who continued long after the retreat of <HI>Alexander,</HI> and re-peopled it with colonies of their own nation. The <HI>Getae</HI> were the most brave and most just of all the <HI>Scythians,</HI> and continued to preserve this character in their new possessions.</P>
<P>A FEW miles lower begins the <HI>Delta</HI> of the <HI>Indus,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PATTALA.</NOTE> named after the <HI>Egyptian,</HI> or that of the <HI>Nile,</HI> and was called by the <HI>Indians, Pattala,</HI> which in their language signifies the same thing. There is a greater and a lesser <HI>Delta.</HI> It is near the

<Q>to all that enter them, by reason of the violent heat of the air.</Q> There is not, at present, in all <HI>India,</HI> a place more fatal to <HI>Europeans.

Those which lay on the sand banks were swept away by the fury of the tide; those which were in the channel, on the mud, received no injury, but were set afloat

<P>THE mention of this, occasions me to return to the conclusion of the expedition of the <HI>Macedonian</HI> hero. When he reached <HI>Pattala,</HI> he found the city deserted: the fame of his barbarity had induced the prince, who had before submitted, to retire with all his subjects. <HI>Alexander,</HI> finding the necessity of re∣peopling the place, sent out light troops, who made some of the late inhabitants prisoners. Those he treated with the utmost kindness, dismissed them, and promised them protection, if they could induce their fellow-citizens to return. He suc∣ceeded in his design; he formed a haven, and made docks, in
<PB N="27" REF="43"/>order to refit his fleet; which, being accomplished, he sailed down into the ocean. The dangers which might occur in an unknown sea, and the pressing instances made by his friends, induced him to return. He landed his forces, and took the rout towards <HI>Gedrosia,</HI> and at length arrived at the city of <HI>Baby∣len,</HI> with the remains of his faithful army, reduced by the toil∣some march, by famine, pestilence, and every calamity which his phrenetic ambition had involved it in.</P>
<P>HE had committed the care of his fleet to <HI>Nearchus,</HI> a man of first rate abilities, who engaged to conduct it through the ocean to the <HI>Persian</HI> Gulph and the <HI>Euphrates.</HI> He performed his engagement, after many difficulties. When he had arrived at <HI>Harmozia,</HI> the modern <HI>Ormus,</HI> he heard that his master was not remote. He landed, with a few of his companions, and in five days reached the army, but so squalid and miserable in their aspect, that <HI>Alexander,</HI> shocked at their appearance, took <HI>Near∣chus</HI> aside, and asked, Whether he had not lost his fleet? On being assured of its safety, he gave way to the most unbound∣ed joy, and crowned both him and <HI>Leonnatus</HI> with golden crowns; <HI>Nearchus</HI> for having preserved the fleet, <HI>Leonnatus</HI> for a victory obtained over the <HI>Oritae;</HI> and the whole army saluted the former with flowers and garlands scattered over their celebrated admiral

<P>I MUST not quit the historical part of the <HI>Indus,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SEMIRAMIS.</NOTE> without mention of the expedition undertaken by the heroine <HI>Semiramis,</HI> many ages before that of <HI>Alexander.</HI> Certainly historians must
<PB N="28" REF="44"/>greatly have exaggerated the preparations; they make her army consist of three millions of foot, and two hundred thou∣sand horse, and a hundred thousand chariots, and multitudes of ships, ready framed, and carried in pieces by land, to be put together in order to cross the <HI>Indus.</HI> I suspect that these vessels were no more than so many coracles, or <HI>vitilia navigia,</HI> made of bamboos, like those used by <HI>Ayder Alli</HI> in our days, on the waters of <HI>Malabar.</HI> In order to supply her wants of real elephants, she caused a multitude of fictitious ones to be made, out of the skins of three hundred thousand black oxen, which were placed on camels backs, guided by a man within this strange machine.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">STABROBATES.</NOTE> <HI>Stabrobates,</HI> king of <HI>India,</HI> received advice of her preparations, and, by a prudent embassy, endeavoured to divert her from her intentions. The Queen rejected his remonstrances, crossed the river, and defeated the fleet of the <HI>Indian</HI> monarch; that perhaps was not difficult, notwithstanding it consisted of four thousand boats; but as they were formed only of the bamboo cane, they never could resist the shock of timber ships. The victory proved fatal to her; she succeeded in crossing the river, but was deceived by the pretended flight of <HI>Stabrobates;</HI> she pursued, and overtook him; the battle was fought: The <HI>Indian</HI> monarch discovered the fictitious elephants, and <HI>Semira∣mis</HI> was totally defeated. She re-passed the river with precipi∣tation; she lost great part of her troops, and returned covered with shame into her own country. So many fabulous circum∣stances attend this expedition, that we may well doubt the veracity of the historian, and possibly of the very existence of the heroine.

<HEAD>REVIEW OF THE <HI>INDUS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I SHALL now give a short topographical review of the ce∣lebrated river, from the ocean to its most remote part, and also of the rivers which swell its stream. That which receives this mighty river is the <HI>Mare Erythroeum,</HI> or modern <HI>Arabian</HI> sea. I have given some account of the <HI>Delta;</HI> let me add that it is,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">DELTA OF THE INDUS.</NOTE> as it was in the time of the antients, unhealthy, and hot to the extreme: all its fertility cannot compensate those inconvenien∣cies. There is a greater and lesser <HI>Delta;</HI> the greater begins a
<PB N="30" REF="46"/>few leagues from <HI>Hydrabad:</HI> the branch called <HI>Nala Sunkra,</HI> forms the eastern side; the lesser is included in the former, and its northern point is at <HI>Aurungabander.</HI> The <HI>Delta</HI> is of great extent, each side being a hundred and fifteen miles. From the sea as high as <HI>Moultan,</HI> is a low and level country, enriched with the water annually overflowing like the river <HI>Nile.</HI> The <HI>Indus,</HI> from the beginning of the <HI>Delta,</HI> almost as high as <HI>Moultan,</HI> runs through a flat tract, bounded by a parallel range of moun∣tains, distant from the banks of the river from thirty to forty miles. That on the western side is rocky, that on the eastern composed of sand. The last, when it approaches the <HI>Delta,</HI> conforms to its shape on the eastern side, and diverges till it reaches the sea.</P>
<P>BEYOND the eastern chain is a vast sandy desert,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SANDY DESERT OF REGISTAN.</NOTE> extending the whole way above a hundred miles in breadth, and in length reaches from near Lat. 23° N. almost as high as the fertile <HI>Pan∣jab,</HI> or Lat. 29° 30′. This is the part of which <HI>Herodotus</HI> (<HI>Thalia,</HI> c. cii.) speaks, when he says, that the eastern part of <HI>India</HI> is rendered desert by sands.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE CAGGAR.</NOTE> Through it runs the river <HI>Caggar,</HI> but the lower part with uncertain course, lost in the sands of the desert, and render the place of its discharge at this time very uncertain. It slows from the north-east, and rises in the <HI>Damaun</HI> chain, which separates it from the distant <HI>Jumna,</HI> and not far from the origin of that great river. On its banks, in Lat. 25° 40′, stands <HI>Ammercot,</HI> a strong fort, the birth place of the great Emperor <HI>Akbar,</HI> when his father <HI>Humaion</HI> took refuge there on his expulsion from his throne by the usurper <HI>Shir Khan,</HI> the famous <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ghan.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">BRAMINABAD.</NOTE> in first remounting the river, is <HI>Braminabad,</HI> once the capital of the <HI>Circar</HI> of <HI>Tattah,</HI> at a small distance from <HI>Tatta.</HI> Its name was taken from its having been sanctified by the chief residence of the <HI>Brahmins,</HI> or perhaps where there might have been pecu∣liar worship paid to the God <HI>Brama.</HI> It had been the antient capital of the country, and its fort was of vast extent, being said to have had fourteen hundred bastions.

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hamilton's Voy. i. 122.</NOTE>. The heats are so violent, owing to the vicinity of the sandy deserts, that the houses are contrived to be ventilated occa∣sionally, by means of apertures in the tops like chimnies; and when the hottest winds prevale, the windows are closely shut, and the hotter current excluded, and the cooler part, being more elevated, descends through the funnels to the gasping inmates

The vast extent of business carried on in the <HI>Delta</HI> was surprising, for <HI>Abulfazel</HI> (see <HI>Ayeen Akberry,</HI> ii. 143.) assures us, that the inhabitants of the <HI>Circar Tattah</HI> had not less than forty thousand boats of different constructions.

<P>I MENTION here the imposthume of the liver,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">LIVER DISEASE.</NOTE> not as a local disease, but on account of a peculiar superstition preserved in this country, the <HI>Sircar of Tatta,</HI> respecting the disorder. The real cause, says <HI>Bontius,</HI> p. 30. <HI>Engl.</HI> edit. arises from intem∣perance; an imposthume is often formed in that part, and on opening it after death it is often found eaten, or honey-combed. The side is not unfrequently laid open to get at the part infected: The impostume is cut, and the liver cleansed. I have heard, from the credulous, strange stories on this head. The <HI>Indians</HI> of the <HI>Sircar</HI> firmly believe, that the disease is inflicted by a set of sorcerers, called <HI>Jiggerkhars,</HI> or liver eaters.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">JIGGERKHARS.</NOTE>
<Q>One of this class,</Q> says the <HI>Ayeen Akberry,</HI> ii. p. 144,
<Q>can steal away the liver of another by looks and incantations. Other accounts say, that by looking at a person he deprives him of his senses, and then steals from him something resembling
<PB N="34" REF="50"/>the seed of a pomegranate, and which he hides in the calf of his leg.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE <HI>Jiggerkhar</HI> throws on the fire the grain before described, which thereupon spreads to the size of a dish, and he distributes it amongst his fellows to be eaten, which ceremony concludes the life of the fascinated person. A <HI>Jig∣gerkhar</HI> is able to communicate his art to another, and which he does by learning him the incantations, and by making him eat a bit of the liver cake. If any one cut open the calf of the magician's leg, extract the grain, and give it to the afflicted person to eat, he immediately recovers. These <HI>Jiggerkhars</HI> are mostly women. It is said, moreover, that they can bring intelligence from a great distance in a short space of time, and if they are thrown into a river with a stone tied to them, they nevertheless will not sink. In order to deprive any one of this wicked power, they brand his temples, and every joint in his body; cram his eyes with salt, suspend him for forty days in a subterraneous cavern, and repeat over him certain incantations. In this state he is called <HI>Detcherch.</HI> Although, after having undergone this discipline, he is not able to destroy the liver of any one, yet he retains the power of being able to discover another <HI>Jiggerkhar,</HI> and is used for detecting those disturbers of mankind. They can also cure many diseases by administering a potion, or by repeating an incantation.</Q> Many other marvellous stories are told of these people.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Delta</HI> has not on it a tree, but in the dry parts is covered with brush wood. In the time of <HI>Abul Fazel,</HI> the inha∣bitants
<PB N="35" REF="51"/>hunted here the wild ass, or <HI>Koulan,</HI> Hist. Quad. i. p. 8. The same author assures us, that the camels were so numerous,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CAMELS.</NOTE> that several of the inhabitants were possessed of herds of ten thousand each, a number exceeding the stock of the patriarch JOB, on the return of his prosperity. Multitudes of camels still are bred on this tract; the rest consists of noisome swamps, or muddy lakes. The <HI>Ritchel</HI> branch is the usual way to <HI>Tatta;</HI> as high as the lake reaches it is a mile broad, at <HI>Tatta</HI> only half a mile. The tide does not run higher than that city, or about sixty-five miles from the sea.</P>
<P><HI>Bakhor</HI> is an antient city and fortress; in its neighborhood,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BAKHOR.</NOTE> on the banks, were observed, by a modern traveller, who went up the river as far as that city, several of the moveable towns, built of wood, such as are mentioned by <HI>Nearchus,</HI> and in the <HI>Ayeen Akberry.</HI> They are inhabited by fishermen or graziers, who constantly change their situation like persons encamped. There were other towns, says <HI>Arrian, Rer. Indic.</HI> i. p. 528, on the higher grounds, and consisted of houses built with bricks and mortar. Beyond <HI>Bakhor,</HI> on the eastern bank of the <HI>Indus,</HI> are <HI>Dary</HI> and <HI>Ken,</HI> and <HI>Bibigundy-check,</HI> and <HI>Sitpour,</HI> each known to us only by name.</P>
<P>IN Lat. 29° 8′, on the eastern side of the <HI>Indus,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE STTLEGE.</NOTE> we meet with the conflux of the <HI>Setlege,</HI> or <HI>Hesudrus,</HI> with that river. The town of <HI>Veh</HI> is at the forks. It is remarkable, that it is the only river we meet with from the discharge of the <HI>Indus</HI> into the sea to this place, a tract of above five hundred and twenty miles. It is the southern boundary of the <HI>Panjah,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PANJAB.</NOTE> or the region of five rivers, so much celebrated for the bloody actions
<PB N="36" REF="52"/>within its limits, by the destroyers of mankind, <HI>Alexander</HI> the great, <HI>Timur Bek,</HI> or <HI>Tamerlane,</HI> and <HI>Kouli Khan.</HI> It is a most fertile tract, often plain, but towards the north and north-east intersected by a chain of hills. The <HI>Setlege</HI> runs in one chan∣nel for some way, then divides, and embracing a considerable island, re-unites for a short space, and at <HI>Ferosapour</HI> separates again. The southern branch retains its name; the northern assumes that of the <HI>Beyah,</HI> or <HI>Hyphasis.</HI> These diverge con∣siderably from each other, then converge, so as almost to meet at their fountains, at the foot of mount <HI>Imaus,</HI> or <HI>Himmaleh.</HI> This tract is called <HI>Jallindar,</HI> and has in it <HI>Sultanpour,</HI> and a few other towns.</P>
<P>NEAR the fountain of the <HI>Beyah</HI> stands the famous temple of NAGERKOTE,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NAGERKOTE.</NOTE> greatly frequented by the <HI>Hindoo</HI> pilgrims, out of veneration to the goddess <HI>Noshabo.</HI> This place out-miracles all miracles: cut out your tongue, and in a few days, sometimes a few hours, it will, with due faith in the saint, be again renewed

<P>ABOUT fifty-five miles above the discharge of the <HI>Setlege,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE CHUNAUB.</NOTE> the <HI>Chunaub,</HI> or <HI>Acesines,</HI> joins itself with the <HI>Indus,</HI> and continues a single channel about the same space, equal in size to that river. On the southern banks, nearly midway, stands <HI>Moultan,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MOULTAN.</NOTE> capital of a province of that name. The country is very productive in cotton; and also sugar, opium, brimstone, galls, and camels, which used to be transported into <HI>Persia.</HI> The galls indicate oaks, which I did not before know grew so far to the south. The finest bows are made in this country; and it produces the most beautiful, and most active female dancers in all <HI>India,</HI> who were in the highest esteem, particularly in the kingdom of <HI>Persia.</HI></P>
<P>THE air is excessively hot, and very little rain falls in these parts. This is a circumstance which attends remarkably the lower part of the <HI>Indus,</HI> especially the <HI>Delta,</HI> where it has been known to have wanted rain for the space of three years.</P>
<P>THE city of <HI>Moultan</HI> stands in Lat. 30° 34′, is small, and strongly fortified. It has a celebrated pagoda, a mosque, with a beautiful minaret, and the place of interment of many pious <HI>Shiekhs. Abulfazel,</HI> ii. 137, says, that it is one of the most antient cities in <HI>India.</HI> It was not the capital of the <HI>Malli,</HI> which Mr. <HI>Rennel</HI> supposes to have been near <HI>Toulumba;</HI> but they inhabited the circumjacent country.</P>
<P><HI>Moultan</HI> was taken by one of the generals of <HI>Tamerlane.</HI> Since the ravages made in this province, after the invasion of <HI>India</HI> by <HI>Kouli Khan,</HI> a conqueror equally barbarous, the trade
<PB N="38" REF="54"/>of the place has received a considerable check. <HI>Thevenot</HI> adds another reason, that in his time, about the year 1665, the river was choaked up, which obstructed greatly all commerce from <HI>Lahore,</HI> and other places to the north-east.</P>
<P>THIS city is the great residence of the <HI>Banians,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BANIANS.</NOTE> or merchants and brokers of <HI>India.</HI> They are of this country, and have here their chieftain. They are of the great commercial cast of the <HI>Bhyse,</HI> created, say the <HI>Hindoos,</HI> by their <HI>Brimhas,</HI> or Supreme Being, from his thighs and belly; but I shall say more of the CASTS hereafter. These form settlements in all the commercial towns in <HI>India.</HI> They also send colonies, for a certain number of years, to the trading towns of <HI>Arabia</HI> and <HI>Persia,</HI> and we find them even as far as <HI>Astrakan.</HI> In the beginning of the present century, about a hundred and fifty or two hundred of this community went from <HI>Moultan</HI> to that city, and carry on a great trade in pretious stones; they live in a large stone <HI>Cara∣vansery.</HI> As they die away, or incline to return home, a supply is sent from <HI>India</HI> by their chief, selected from among their young unmarried relations. As they have no females from their own country, they keep, during their residence at <HI>Astra∣kan, Tartarian</HI> women, but the contract is only during that time. They are a sine race of men, and are highly esteemed for the integrity of their dealings
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Communicated to me by Dr. PALLAS.</NOTE> These support the most im∣portant trade of <HI>Astrakan,</HI> by carrying it through <HI>Astrabad</HI> to the inland parts of the <HI>Mogul</HI> empire. This points out a more southern inland road than was known in the middle ages, when the merchants went by the way of <HI>Bochara</HI> and <HI>Samarcand,</HI> to the northern cities of <HI>India, Candahar</HI> and <HI>Cabul.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="55"/>AT the distance of about sixty miles from its mouth, the <HI>Chenauh</HI> divides into two branches, which flow from the north∣west from their origin, at the foot of the <HI>Himmaleh</HI> chain. The most southern is the <HI>Rauvee,</HI> the old <HI>Hydraotes.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE RAUVEE.</NOTE> About twenty∣four miles from its mouth, on the southern side, stand the fort and town of <HI>Toulamba.</HI> They lay in the route of <HI>Tamerlane,</HI>

The sum was a hundred thousand.</P>
<P>THE city of <HI>Lahore</HI> is next,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">LAHORE.</NOTE> about a hundred and fifty miles distant from <HI>Moultan.</HI> It is the capital of the <HI>Seiks,</HI> a people which started up in the fifteenth century, under a <HI>Hindoo</HI> of the name of <HI>Nanuck,</HI> born in 1470. They are a set of religionists, tolerant in matters of faith like the <HI>Hindoos,</HI> but, unlike them,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE SEIKS.</NOTE> admit proselytes. They require a conformity in certain signs and ceremonies, but in other respects are pure monotheists; they worship God alone, without image or intermediation. They may be called the reformers of <HI>India.</HI> They retain also a <HI>calvi∣nistical</HI> principle, and take an oath ever to oppose a monarchical government. They eat any kind of meat excepting beef, for like the <HI>Hindoos</HI> they hold the ox in the utmost veneration. Their general food is pork, probably because it is forbidden by
<PB N="40" REF="56"/>the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> whom they hold in abhorrence. Their army con∣sists wholly of horse; they can raise a hundred thousand cavalry, and make war in the most savage mode. They kept long con∣cealed or unnoticed, at length became formidable by their courage and enterprize, and extended their conquests over <HI>Lahore, Moultan,</HI> and the western parts of <HI>Delhi.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lahore</HI> is a city of great antiquity, and was the residence of the first <HI>Mahometan</HI> conquerors in <HI>India,</HI> before they were esta∣blished in the central parts. In 1043, in the reign of <HI>Mahmood,</HI> it was closely besieged by the confederated <HI>Hindoos,</HI> who were compelled to retire on a vigorous sally made by the garrison. It is also a Soubaliship of considerable extent. <HI>Humaioon,</HI> father of <HI>Akbar,</HI> kept his court here part of his days. Its length, suburbs included, was at that period three leagues. It had a magnificent palace, and several other fine buildings built of brick. Possibly its trade is declined since the obstruction of the bed of the river, by the banks of sand or gravel. Here begins the famous avenue which extended five hundred miles, even to <HI>Agra.</HI> It consists, according to <HI>Thevenot,</HI> Part iii. p. 61, of what he calls <HI>Achy</HI> trees. It was planted in 1619, by <HI>Jehangìr:</HI> He also erected an obelisk at the end of every <HI>cose,</HI> and at the end of every third <HI>cose</HI> was sunk a well for the refreshment of travellers.</P>
<P>THE pestilence first appeared in the <HI>Panjab</HI> in 1616,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PESTILENCE.</NOTE> spread to <HI>Lahore,</HI> and then broke out in the <HI>Duab</HI> and <HI>Dehli.</HI> It never before was known in <HI>Hindoostan,</HI> if the memoirs of <HI>Jehangìr</HI> are to be depended on; but Mr. <HI>Gibbon,</HI> iv. 328, assures us, that the dreadful plague which depopulated the earth in the time of

<P>THE province of <HI>Lahore</HI> is celebrated for its fine breed of horses.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">FINE HORETS.</NOTE> The <HI>Mogul</HI> Emperors used to establish studs in different parts, and furnish them with their lamed stallions of the <HI>Persian</HI> and <HI>Arabian</HI> kind, for the farther improvement.

<P><HI>Abulfazel,</HI> ii. 223, speaking of the rivers of this country, says,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">METALS.</NOTE> that the natives, by washing the sands, obtain Gold, Silver,

<P>A VAST mountain of rock salt is found in this province,

<P>THE famous canal of <HI>Shah Nehr</HI> begins at <HI>Ragipour,</HI> and is continued almost parallel to the <HI>Rauvee,</HI> and ends at <HI>Lahore,</HI> a distance of above eighty miles. The intent of this canal seems to have been to supply <HI>Lahore</HI> with water in the dry season, when all the <HI>Indian</HI> rivers are from twenty to thirty feet below the level of their banks. Three other canals, for the purpose of watering the country on the south and east of <HI>Lahore,</HI> were drawn from the same place. These, formed in a distant age, are strong proofs of attention to rural oeconomy, and the benefit of the subject.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Chunaub,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHUNAUB, UPPER.</NOTE> for a few miles, is continued from its forks in a single channel. Near <HI>Zusserabad,</HI> the <HI>Jhylum,</HI> or <HI>Behut,</HI> falls into it with vast rapidity and violence. This was the place where <HI>Alexander</HI> so nearly lost his fleet in the passage through this turbulent conflux. The <HI>Chunaub</HI> flows in a strait channel from the foot of the <HI>Himmaleb</HI> or <HI>Imaus,</HI> and there originates from two streams which quickly re-unite. <HI>Gujerat,</HI> and <HI>Jum∣moo</HI> and <HI>Mundal,</HI> are town and forts on its banks. From the origin of the <HI>Chunaub</HI> to that of the <HI>Rauvee,</HI> is a plain tract,
<PB N="43" REF="59"/>bounded to the east by mount <HI>Imaus,</HI> bounded on the west and south by the chain of the <HI>Panjah</HI> hills. There is another plain similar, from the upper part of the <HI>Setlege</HI> as far as the <HI>Ganges,</HI> where it flows through the province of <HI>Sirinagur.</HI></P>
<P>I NOW ascend, from its union with the <HI>Chunaub,</HI> the <HI>Behut,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE BEHUT.</NOTE> the most celebrated of the five rivers, the <HI>Fabulosus Hydaspes,</HI> which flows in two magnificent meanders, and issuing from a narrow gap between exalted mountains, from its origin in the romantic <HI>Cashmere;</HI> partly along a plain, partly at the foot of mountains cloathed with forests of trees of size magnificent, many of which are perishing continually through weight of years, and others succeeding them in the full verdure and vigor of youth. Would my pen could be inspired like that of M. <HI>Bernier,</HI> who in 1664 attended in quality of a physician, and philosophic friend, to a great <HI>Omrah</HI> of that time, a follower of <HI>Aurengezebe</HI> in his splendid progress to <HI>Cashmere</HI> for the recovery of his health, by a change of the burning clime of <HI>Hindoostan,</HI> for the salubrious air of the former. I leave to the reader the perusal of <HI>Bernier,</HI> the first traveller, I may say, of his, or any other age. I shall in a very abridged form take up the account from the departure of the court from <HI>Agra.</HI> His suite was an army. He was also attended by his sister, which gave splendor unspeakable to the train of ladies. He left <HI>Agra</HI> in the moment pronounced fortunate by the im∣perial astrologers. To this day nothing is done without their auspices. He took the road to <HI>Lahore,</HI> hunting or hawking on each side as occasion offered. Among the nobler game, a lion presented itself. In crossing the rivers bridges of boats were used for the purpose. The heats on the march were dreadful,
<PB N="44" REF="60"/>caused by the lofty mountains of <HI>Cashmere,</HI> keeping the cool air of the north from refreshing the parched plains. Between the <HI>Chenaub</HI> and the <HI>Behut</HI> is the vast mountain <HI>Bember.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MOUNTAIN BEMBER.</NOTE> It seems like a purgatory to be passed before the entrance into the PA∣RADISE of <HI>Hindoostan</HI> can be accomplished. It is steep, black, and burned. The procession encamped in the channel of a large torrent, dried up, full of sand and stones burning hot. "After passing the <HI>Bember,</HI>" says the elegant traveller,
<Q>we pass from a torrid to a temperate zone: for we had no sooner mounted this dreadful wall of the world, I mean, this high, steep, black and bald mountain of <HI>Bember,</HI> but that in descend∣ing on the other side, we found an air that was pretty tolerable, fresh, gentle, and temperate. But that which surprised me more in these mountains, was to find myself in a trice trans∣ported out of the <HI>Indies</HI> into <HI>Europe.</HI> For seeing the earth covered with all our plants and shrubbs, except <HI>Issop,</HI> Thyme, Marjoram,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">EUROPEAN TREES.</NOTE> and Rosemary, I imagined I was in some of our mountains of <HI>Auvergne,</HI> in the midst of a forest of all our kinds of Trees, Pines, Oaks, Elms, Plane-trees. And I was the more astonished, because in all those burning fields of <HI>Indostan,</HI> whence I came, I had seen almost nothing of all that.</Q></P>
<P><Q>AMONG other things relating to plants this surprized me, that one and a half days journey from <HI>Bember</HI> I found a moun∣tain that was covered with them on both sides, but with this difference, that on the side of the mountain that was southerly, towards the <HI>Indies,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">INDIAN.</NOTE> there was a mixture of <HI>Indian</HI> and <HI>Euro∣pean</HI> plants, and on that which was exposed to the North, I observed none but <HI>European</HI> ones; as if the former had par∣ticipated
<PB N="45" REF="61"/>of the air and temper of <HI>Europe</HI> and the <HI>Indies,</HI> and the other had been meerly <HI>European.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I NOW enter the kingdom of <HI>Cashmere,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">KINGDOM OF CASHMERE.</NOTE> and immediately re∣sume the words of the elegant traveller.
<Q>Thousands of cas∣cades descend from the surrounding mountains of this en∣chanting plain, and forming rivulets meandring through all parts render it so fair and fruitful, that one would take this whole kingdom for some great <HI>Evergreen</HI> garden, intermixed with villages and burroughs, discovering themselves between trees, and diversisied by Meadows, Fields of Rice, Corn, and divers other Legumes, of Hemp and Saffron; all interlaced with ditches full of water, with Channels, with small Lakes and Rivulets here and there. Up and down and every where are also seen some of our <HI>European</HI> plants, Flowers, and all sorts of our Trees, as Apples, Pears, Prunes, Apricots, Cherries, Nuts, Vines; the particular Gardens are full of Melons, Skirrets, Beets, Radishes, all sorts of our Pot-herbs, and of some we have not.</Q></P>
<P>THIS HAPPY VALLEY, this PARADISE OF HINDOOSTAN,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ONCE A LAKE.</NOTE> of the <HI>Indian</HI> poets, is of an oval form, about eighty miles long and forty broad, and was once supposed to have been entirely filled with water; which having burst its mound, left this vale in∣riched to the most distant ages by the sertilizing mud of the rivers which fed its expanse. This delicious spot is surrounded by mountains of vast height and rude aspect, covered with snow, or enchased in glacieres, in which this enchanting jewel is firmly set. At the foot of the exterior chain is an interior circle of hills, fertile in grass, abundant in trees and various sorts of ve∣getation, and full of all kinds of cattle, as Cows, Sheep, Goats,
<PB N="46" REF="62"/>Gazelles, and Musks. The approach to <HI>Cashmere</HI> is also very rugged and difficult. We have mentioned the mountains of <HI>Bember;</HI> besides those is one on which the pioneers of <HI>Aurenge∣zebe</HI> were obliged to cut through a <HI>glaciere,</HI> or a great mass, as <HI>Bernier</HI> calls it, of icy snow
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 103.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE capital of this happy spot is sometimes called <HI>Cashmere,</HI> sometimes <HI>Sirinagur,</HI> and sometimes <HI>Nagaz</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">By Cheresiddin, in his Life of Timur Bee, ii. 96.</NOTE>, is seated in Lat. 34° 12′ North, on the banks of the river, which runs with a current most remarkably smooth. At a little distance from it is a small but beautiful lake, with a communication with the river by a navigable canal. The town was, in <HI>Bernier</HI>'s time, three quarters of a <HI>French</HI> league long, built on both sides, and some part extended to the lake. Villas, Mosques, and Pagodas, decorate several of the little hills that border the water. The houses are built of wood, four stories high, some higher; the lower is for the cattle, the next for the family, the third and fourth serve as warehouses. The roofs are planted with tulips, which in the spring produce a wonderful effect. Roses, and numberless other flowers ornament this happy clime. The inhabitants often visit the lake in their boats for the pleasure of hawking, the country abounding with cranes, and variety of game.</P>
<P>THE river,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">RIVER BEHUT, OR IHLUM.</NOTE> which rises at <HI>Wair Naig,</HI> near the southern part of the surrounding mountains, flows with a north-western course by the capital, and falls into lake <HI>Ouller,</HI> which is fifty-three miles in length, and lies in the northern part of the valley, not remote from the kingdom of great <HI>Thibet,</HI> then passes through the outlet at <HI>Barehmooleh,</HI> between two steep mountains, and
<PB N="47" REF="63"/>from thence, after a long course, to its junction with the <HI>Chunaub.</HI> This river is large and navigable, even within the limits of <HI>Cashmere. Bernier,</HI> p. 84. says, it carries boats as large as those on the <HI>Seine</HI> at <HI>Paris.</HI> Many small lakes are spread over the surface, and some of them contain floating islands. Among others, <HI>Bernier,</HI> p. 118. visited one, which he calls
<Q>A great lake amidst the mountains, which had ice in summer, and looked like a little icy sea, having heaps of ice made and unmade by the winds.</Q> This reminds me of the coalition and separation of the ice in the <HI>Spitzbergen</HI> seas. This in question may be like the <HI>Ouller,</HI> for I see none of any size in the maps, excepting that expanse of water.</P>
<P>AMONG the miraculous waters of the natives, he reckons a periodical spring, or the ebbing and flowing well of <HI>Sandbrarc,</HI> which has near to it the temple of the idol of <HI>Brare.</HI> The reader may amuse himself with the account, from p. 105 to 110 of this favorite writer, and at p. 117 those of another, much of the same nature.</P>
<P>THE author of the <HI>Ayeen Akberry</HI> dwells with rapture on the beauties of <HI>Cashmere;</HI> whence we may conclude, that it was a favorite subject with his master <HI>Acbar,</HI> who had visited it three times before <HI>Abulfazel</HI> wrote. Other emperors of <HI>Hindoostan</HI> visited it also, and seemed to forget the cares of government during their residence in the HAPPY VALLEY. By the salubrity of the air, and the chearing beauties of the place, they collected new vigor to resume the cares of government. The remains of the palaces, pavilion, and gardens, exhibit proofs of their elegance and splendor. It appears, that the periodical rains, which almost deluge the rest of <HI>India,</HI> are shut out of <HI>Cashmere</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="64"/>by the height of the mountains, so that only light showers fall there; these, however, are in abundance sufficient to feed the thousands of cascades which are precipitated into the valley from every part of the stupendous and ro∣mantic bulwark that encircles it. Amidst the various feli∣cities of the <HI>Cashmerians,</HI> one dreadful evil they are constantly subject to, namely, earthquakes; but to guard against their terrible effects, all their houses are built of wood, of which there is no want.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Cashmerians</HI> are esteemed a most witty race, and much more intelligent and ingenious than the <HI>Hindoos,</HI> and as much addicted to the sciences and to poetry as the very <HI>Persians.</HI> They have a language of their own: but their books are writ∣ten in the <HI>Shanscrit</HI> tongue, although the character be some∣times <HI>Cashmerian</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ayeen Akberry, ii. 155.</NOTE>. They are also very industrious, and ex∣cellent mechanics. The various articles of their workmanship are sent into all parts of <HI>India</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Bernier, p. 93.</NOTE>. This race is famous for the fineness of their features, and their admirable complexions. They look like <HI>Europeans,</HI> and have nothing of the <HI>Tartarian</HI> flat-nosed face, and small eyes, like those of <HI>Caschguer</HI> and their neighbors of <HI>Thibet.</HI> It is certainly quite right, that this PARADISE, THE REGION OF ETERNAL SPRING, should be peopled with females angelic: they are uncommonly beautiful. The courtiers of the time of <HI>Bernier</HI> were most solicitous to obtain for their <HI>Zenanas</HI> the <HI>Cashmerian</HI> fair, in order that they might have children whiter than the natives of <HI>Hindoostan,</HI> in order that they might pass for the true <HI>Mogul</HI>-breed, congene∣rous with their monarch.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="65"/>THE religion of the <HI>Cashmerians</HI> is the same as that of the <HI>Hindoos;</HI> possibly the pardonable superstition of the inhabitants, warmed by their romantic situation, may have multiplied the places of worship of <HI>Mahadeo,</HI> of <HI>Beschan,</HI> and of <HI>Brama.</HI> Here is a sect of religionists, free from idolatry, which worship the Deity alone. They are remarkably benevolent, and abstain from the other sex. They must therefore be continued by disciples. As to the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> they are not numerous, and those split into sects
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ayeen, ii. 155.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Cashmerians</HI> seem to have had an idea of the deluge, for, say they, in the early ages of the world, all <HI>Cashmere,</HI> except the mountains, was covered with water. One <HI>Kushup</HI> brought the <HI>Brahmins</HI> to inhabit the country as soon as the waters had subsided
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Same, 178, 179.</NOTE>. Neither were they ignorant of the history of <HI>Noah,</HI> for the <HI>Indians</HI> speak of him under the name of <HI>Sattiaviraden,</HI> who, with his wife, was by the god <HI>Vichenou,</HI> who sent to them an ark, preserved from destruction in a general deluge
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Sonnerat, vol. ii. 158.</NOTE>. The first monarch of the country was <HI>Owgnund,</HI> who was elected, says <HI>Abulfazul,</HI> 4444 years before his time
<NOTE PLACE="foot">§ Ayeen, 179.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HERE are numbers of hermits in places nearly inaccessible. They are highly venerated, some being supposed to have power to excite the fury of the elements. <HI>Bernier,</HI> p. 104, found an an∣tient anchoute, who had inhabited the summit of the lofty moun∣tain <HI>Pire-penjale</HI> ever since the time of <HI>Jehangire,</HI> who was here in 1618. His religion was unknown. To him was attributed the power of working miracles. He caused at his pleasure great
<PB N="50" REF="66"/>thunders, and raised storms of hail, rain, snow, and wind. He looked savage, having a large white beard uncombed, which, like that of our Druid, "streamed like a meteor to the troubled air." The sage forbid the making the lest noise, on pain of raising furious storms and tempests.</P>
<P><HI>Cashmere</HI> is famous for its manufacture of <HI>shawls,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SHAWLS.</NOTE> made of the wool of the broad-tailed sheep, who are found in the king∣dom of <HI>Thibet;</HI> and their fleeces, in fineness, beauty, and length, says Mr. <HI>Bogle,</HI> in Ph. Trans. lxviii. 485, exceed all others in the world. The <HI>Cashmerians</HI> engross this article, and have factors in all parts of <HI>Thibet</HI> for buying up the wool, which is sent into <HI>Cashmere,</HI> and worked into <HI>shawls,</HI> superior in elegance to those woven even from the fleeces of their own country. This ma∣nufacture is a considerable source of wealth. <HI>Bernier</HI> relates, that in his days, <HI>shawls</HI> made expressly for the great <HI>Omrahs,</HI> of the <HI>Thibetian</HI> wool, cost a hundred and fifty <HI>roupees,</HI> whereas those made of the wool of the country never cost more than fifty.</P>
<P><HI>Akbar</HI> was a most particular encourager of the manufacture. He not only paid a great attention to those of this province, but introduced them into <HI>Lahore,</HI> where, in his days, there were a thousand manufactories, says <HI>Abulfazul,</HI> of this com∣modity. The natural color of the wool of the <HI>Tools assel,</HI> the name of the animal, is grey, tinged with red, but some are quite white. <HI>Akbar</HI> first introduced the dying them. The wool of another animal used in the manufacture is white or black, out out of which were woven white, black, and grey shawls. Possibly two sorts of animals may produce the material; one
<PB N="51" REF="67"/>indisputably the sheep I mention, the other I have heard called a goat.</P>
<P>THE domestic animals of this country are horses, small, hardy, and sure-footed. Cows, black and ugly, but yield plenty of milk and excellent butter. Here is also a sheep, called <HI>Hundoo,</HI> which is used to carry burdens. No description is left to vindicate me for imagining it to be either the camel, <HI>(Llama,</HI> Hist. Quad. i. N<SUP>o</SUP> 73.) or the <HI>Chilihucque</HI> (N<SUP>o</SUP> 74.); the first of which is used for burdens in <HI>Peru,</HI> the last, formerly in <HI>Chili.</HI> Certain it is that <HI>India</HI> has a tall sheep, which, saddled, actually can carry a boy twelve years old. It is found about <HI>Surat.</HI> Whether it could bear the snows of the <HI>Cashmerian</HI> Alps, I leave for the subject of future inquiry.</P>
<P><HI>Abulfazul,</HI> p. 155, vol. ii. mentions the elk as one of the wild animals of the country; and adds, that the hunting leo∣pards are made use of in the chase of that enormous deer. The <HI>Chittah,</HI> or hunting leopard, must be brought from the scorched plains of <HI>Bengal.</HI> The elk may be a native of the woods at the base of the snowy mountains, for they are impatient of heat, and require forests, for they subsist both by browzing and by grazing.</P>
<P><HI>Cashmere,</HI> says its historians,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PRINCES.</NOTE> had its own princes four thou∣sand years before its conquest by <HI>Akbar</HI> in 1585. <HI>Humaioon</HI> cast a longing eye on this rich gem, but by different accidents the acquisition was reserved for his son. <HI>Akbar</HI> would have sound dissiculty to reduce this paradise of the <HI>Indies,</HI> situated as it is within such a fortress of mountains, but its monarch, <HI>Yu∣sof Khan,</HI> was basely betrayed by his <HI>Omrahs. Akbar</HI> used his conquest with moderation, and allowed a pension to the con∣quered
<PB N="52" REF="68"/><HI>Khan</HI> and his gallant son. From that time this happy valley enjoyed the most perfect tranquillity.</P>
<P>THAT 'devouring prince,'
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TAMERLANE THERE.</NOTE> as <HI>Tamerlane</HI> was called by the <HI>Hindoos,</HI> encamped at a place called <HI>Gebban,</HI> on the frontiers of <HI>Cashmere.</HI> During his stay in that delicious country, he seems to have forgot his cruelty, and left without doing any injury to the innocent inhabitants

<P>I REJOIN the <HI>Indus</HI> at the mouth of the <HI>Chenaub.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">INDUS CON∣TINUED.</NOTE> A little higher, on the west side, it receives the <HI>Lucca,</HI> an obscure river, which flows from the north-west, rising in the kingdom of <HI>Candahar.</HI> It is the only one which falls into the <HI>Indus</HI> in all the extent of the western side. Above that, on the same side, is the <HI>Cow,</HI> or <HI>Cophenes,</HI> which leads to <HI>Ghizni</HI> and to <HI>Bamia,</HI> at the foot of the <HI>Paropamysan Caucasus;</HI> beyond that we pass the mouth of the <HI>Kameh,</HI> or <HI>Guraeus,</HI> which flows from <HI>Cabul.</HI> The principal places in the vicinity of these rivers have already been noticed.</P>
<P>I NOW return to <HI>Attock,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MR. FORSTER'S JOURNEY.</NOTE> where the river assumes the name of that city, till it reaches the conflux of the <HI>Chenaub,</HI> below
<PB N="53" REF="69"/><HI>Moultan. Attock</HI> signifies the <HI>forbidden,</HI> it having been the original boundary of <HI>Hindoostan</HI> on this side, which the <HI>Hindoos</HI> were prohibited from passing. Here the river is three quarters of a mile broad, the water very cold, rapid, and turbulent, and a great deal of black sand suspended in it. A little above <HI>Attock</HI> is <HI>Bazaar,</HI> where Mr. <HI>Forster</HI> crossed the <HI>Indus.</HI> The extraor∣dinary journey of that gentleman merits notice. In the dis∣guise of an <HI>Asiatic</HI> he left <HI>Calcutta</HI> in 1783, crossed the <HI>Ganges</HI> between <HI>Loldong</HI> and <HI>Hurdwar,</HI> and the <HI>Jumna</HI> near <HI>Meiro;</HI> proceeded on the south side of the mountains to <HI>Jummoo,</HI> and then seems to have made a tour of curiosity to <HI>Cashmere.</HI> From thence turned towards the south-west, to <HI>Bazaar;</HI> went north∣ward to <HI>Cabul,</HI> where he found the bills of <HI>Calicut,</HI> seventeen or eighteen hundred miles distant, negociable: from thence went to <HI>Candahar,</HI> and crossed the modern provinces of <HI>Seisten, Korasan,</HI> and <HI>Mazanderan,</HI> to the shore of the <HI>Caspian</HI> sea; took shipping at <HI>Basrush,</HI> reached the <HI>Volga,</HI> and arrived safe at <HI>Petersburg.</HI> From <HI>Oude,</HI> the last <HI>British</HI> station, to the <HI>Caspian</HI> sea, was twenty-seven hundred miles. His security lay in his concealment of his country; he travelled with <HI>Asiatics,</HI> he was obliged to conform to their manners, to content himself with the cookery of every place he passed through, submit to every accommodation, and generally to sleep in the open air, even in rain and snow, and this he endured in a journey of a whole year. He returned to <HI>India,</HI> and ended, of late years, at the court of the <HI>Nizam,</HI> in a public capacity, his active and most enterprizing life.</P>
<P>AFTER reaching <HI>Bazaar</HI> we are very little acquainted with the course of the <HI>Indus.</HI> Mr. <HI>Rennel</HI> informs us, that the highest
<PB N="54" REF="70"/>point to which this river can be traced, is <HI>Shuckur,</HI> two hundred and thirty miles distant from <HI>Attock;</HI> and from <HI>Attock</HI> to the sea is six hundred and sorty. By the excellent map of the world published by Mr. <HI>Arrowsmith,</HI> it appears to pass through a long and narrow gap, between two chains of mountains, and to terminate at its origin in the middle of <HI>Cashgar.</HI> What that distance is from <HI>Shuckur</HI> I cannot with certainty pronounce: perhaps a hundred miles. Adding this to the two other num∣bers, we may fairly call the whole length a thousand miles.</P>
<P>MR. RENNEL says, that it has an uninterrupted navigation from the sea for flat-bottomed vessels of near two hundred tons, as high as <HI>Moultan</HI> and <HI>Lahore;</HI> the last about six hundred and fifty miles distant. The current of the <HI>Indus</HI> must be rapid; for Captain <HI>Hamilton</HI> (i. p. 123.) informs us, that the vessels frequently fall down the river from <HI>Lahore</HI> to <HI>Tatta</HI> in twelve days; but the passage up the stream requires six or seven weeks. It once had a vast trade carried on along its channel, but by reason of troubles, and consequential bad government, it is greatly reduced.</P>
<P>I NOW return to the ocean. The eastern branch of the <HI>Indus</HI> falls into the bay of <HI>Cutch,</HI> which runs far inland, and receives the river <HI>Puddar,</HI> bounded by the rugged country of <HI>Cutch.</HI> Part of the gulph is infested with piratical tribes, called <HI>Sangarians,</HI> who infest the sea from hence to the entrance of the gulph of <HI>Persia.</HI> M. <HI>D'Anville</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eclaircissements, p. 42, as quoted by Mr Rennel.—See Memoir, p. 186.</NOTE> supposes them to have been the same as the people of <HI>Sangada (Arrian, Rerum Indic.</HI> i. p. 551.) which the historian places near the
<PB N="55" REF="71"/>river <HI>Arabius.</HI> This may have been the case on supposing, which might have been probable, that they had removed from the western to the eastern side of the <HI>Indus,</HI> and from thence to the shores of the gulph of <HI>Cutch.</HI> The banks of the river are possessed by <HI>reguli;</HI> most of its sides are low, fenny, and liable to annual inundations. This gulph was the antient <HI>Canthi-colpus</HI> and <HI>Sinus Irinus.

This river is not bordered by any places remarkable. In the middle ages the famed <HI>empo∣rium, Nehrwaleh,</HI> stood on the banks of the <HI>Surutwutty,</HI> a small river which flows into it from the south, in lat. 23° 47″, E. long. 72° 30″. It stood on the site of <HI>Puttan;</HI> and flourished in the middle ages. It was reckoned the most fertile country in <HI>India,</HI> and was at that time capital of <HI>Guzerat. Mahmood</HI> I. <HI>(Ferishta,</HI> i. p. 77.) made a conquest of it in 1024. Above a cen∣tury after that, <HI>El Edrisi,</HI> p. 62, speaks of it under the name of <HI>Nahrvara,</HI> and as a place of vast trade, and the great resort of merchants. Its monarchs were styled <HI>Balahare,</HI> i. e. KING OF KINGS, for all the neighboring <HI>reguli</HI> acknowledged his supremacy. The time of its destruction is not well known.

<Q><HI>Cytor</HI> is an antient ruined city, on a hill, but shews the footsteps of wonderful magnificence. There are still standing above a hundred churches, all of carved stone, many fair towers and lanthorns, many pillars, and innumerable houses, but not one inhabitant.

<P>LET not this, or several other instances of unprincely barba∣rity, be attributed to the influence of climate. The greatest
<PB N="58" REF="74"/>monarchs, bred under the severest skies, have shewn themselves monsters of cruelties, notwithstanding they have been held up to us as models of greatness. Among those of the North are <HI>Basilovitz</HI> II. and <HI>Peter</HI> the Great. And in <HI>Hindoostan,</HI> the favo∣rite <HI>Akbar,</HI> and others, successors or predecessors. Their enor∣mities are the result of education; indulged first in every in∣fant-passion, then in those of youth, till they become ungovern∣able; and every opposition to their will appears criminal, and brings on the most dreadful revenge, and the frequent havoke of the human race. Compare then the manners of the princes of this country with those of the myriads of the mean∣est of the <HI>Hindoo</HI> subjects; education has produced monsters of the former: climate has softened into gentleness, resignation, and the fullest submission in the minds of the latter to every evil, to famine, sickness, and tyrannic fury.</P>

<P>"THE same day of our arrival,"
<NOTE PLACE="marg">HOSPITAL FOR BIRDS.</NOTE> says he, p. 35,
<Q>after we had dined, and rested a while, we caused ourselves to be con∣ducted
<PB N="65" REF="82"/>to see a famous hospital of birds, of all forts, which, for being sick, lame, deprived of their mates, or otherwise needing food, and cure, are kept and tended there with dili∣gence; as also the men who take care of them are maintained by the public alms; the <HI>Indian</HI> Gentiles (who, with <HI>Pythago∣ras,</HI> and the antient <HI>Egyptians,</HI> the first authors of this opi∣nion, according to <HI>Herodotus,</HI> believe the transinigration of fouls, not only from man to man, but also from man to brute beast) conceiving it no less a work of charity to do good to beasts, than to men. The house of this hospital is small, a little room sufficing for many birds: Yet I saw it full of birds of all sorts which need tendance, as cocks, hens, pigeons, peacocks, ducks, and small birds, which during their being lame or sick, or mateless, are kept here; but, being recovered and in good plight, if they be wild, they are let go at liberty; if domestic, they are given to some pious person, who keeps them in his house. The most curious thing I saw in this place, was certain little mice, who, being found orphans without fire or dam to tend them, were put into this hospi∣tal, and a venerable old man with a white beard, keeping them in a box amongst cotton, very diligently tended them, with his spectacles on his nose, giving them milk to eat with a bird's feather, because they were so little that as yet they could eat nothing else; and, as he told us, he intended when they were grown up to let them go free whither they pleased.</Q></P>
<P>"THE next morning," (p. 36) adds he,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">FOR GOATS, &amp;c.</NOTE> <Q>we saw another hospital of goats, kids, sheep, and wethers, either sick or lame;
<PB N="66" REF="83"/>and there were also some cocks, peacocks, and other animals needing the same help, and kept altogether quietly enough, in a great court: nor wanted there men and women, lodged in little rooms of the same hospital, who had care of them. In another place, far from hence, we saw another hospital of cows and calves, some whereof had broken legs, others, more infirm, very old or lean, and therefore were kept here to be cured. Among the beasts there was also a <HI>Mahometan</HI> thief, who, having been taken in theft, had both his hands cut off; but the compassionate Gentiles, that he might not perish miserably, now he was no longer able to get his living, took him into this place, and kept him among the poor beasts, not suffering him to want any thing. Moreover, without one of the gates of the city, we saw another great troop of cows, calves, and goats, which being cured and brought into better plight, or gathered together from being dispersed, and with∣out masters, or being redeemed with money from the <HI>Mahome∣tans,</HI> who would have killed them to eat, (namely, the goats and other animals, but not the cows and calves) were sent into the field to feed by neat-herds, purposely maintained at the public charge; and thus they are kept, till, being re∣duced to perfect health, 'tis found fitting to give them to some citizens or others, who may charitably keep them. I excepted cows and calves from the animals redeemed from slaughter; because in <HI>Cambaia,</HI> cows, calves, and oxen are not killed by any; and there is a great prohibition against it, by the instance of the Gentiles, who upon this account pay a great sum of money to the prince; and should any, either

The words of that very in∣telligent writer Mr. <HI>Rennel,</HI> will best convey the idea of the importance of this invaluable tree.</P>
<P><Q>I CANNOT close this account without remarking the unpar∣donable negligence we are guilty of, in delaying to build teek ships of war for the use of the <HI>Indian</HI> seas. They might be freighted home, without the ceremony of regular equipment, as to masts, sails, and furniture, which might be calculated just to answer the purpose of the home passage at the best season; and crews could be provided in <HI>India.</HI> The letter an∣nexed, which was written with the best intentions, nine or ten years ago, will explain the circumstances of the case.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">VAST DURA∣TION.</NOTE> Teek ships of forty years old and upwards, are no uncommon objects in the <HI>Indian</HI> seas; while an <HI>European</HI> built ship is ruined there in five years. The ships built at <HI>Bombay</HI> are the
<PB N="82" REF="100"/>best, both in point of work manship and materials, of any that are constructed in <HI>India:</HI> and although fourth rates only are mentioned in the letter, there is no doubt but that third rates may be constructed, as there is a choice of timber. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> build capital ships in their foreign settlements. The <HI>East India</HI> Company have a teek ship on her fourth voyage at present, which ship has wintered in <HI>England,</HI> therefore any objection founded on the effects of frost on the teek timber, is done away.</Q></P>
<P><Q>FREQUENT have been the opportunities I have had of ob∣serving how very rapid the decay of ships built of <HI>European</HI> timber is in the <HI>East Indies;</HI> and, on the contrary, how du∣rable the ships are, that are built of the wood of that country; namely, the teek, which may not improperly be styled <HI>In∣dian</HI> oak. The number of ships of war that were ruined in those seas during the late war (1757 to 1762) may be admitted as a proof of the former remark; and the great age of the ships built in <HI>India</HI> may serve to prove the latter. What I mean to infer from this, for your Lordship's use is, that ships of war under third rates may be constructed in <HI>India,</HI> and with mo∣derate repairs last for ages; whereas a ship of <HI>European</HI> con∣struction can remain there but a very few years; to which dis∣advantage may be added, that of losing, in the mean time, the services of the ships that are sent to relieve the worn out ones.</Q></P>

He ex∣tended his conquests from <HI>Baglana,</HI> near <HI>Surat,</HI> to the <HI>Portu∣guese</HI> districts near <HI>Goa,</HI> a little beyond the foot of the <HI>Ghauts.</HI> His capital was <HI>Poonah,</HI> an open town, but he kept his archives at <HI>Poorundar,</HI> a place of vast strength, a fortress on the summit of a mountain; he died in 1680. His successors extended their conquests, or rather their inroads, all over <HI>Hindoostan;</HI> and even compelled the great <HI>Mogul</HI> to pay them a <HI>chout,</HI> or tribute, to save his subjects from future calamities.</P>
<P>FROM time to time they extended their dominions to a vast magnitude,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">THEIR GOVERN∣MENT.</NOTE> and divided them into two empires, that of <HI>Poonah,</HI> or the western, and <HI>Berar,</HI> or the eastern. The first is divided again among a number of chieftains, who pay just as much obedience as they like to a <HI>Paishwah,</HI> or head, whom Mr. <HI>Rennel</HI> justly compares to the emperor of <HI>Germany,</HI> and the chieftains to the princes of that great body; they often quarrel with him, and often among themselves, and never are united, but by the apprehension of a common danger. Their empires extend from <HI>Guzerat</HI> to near the banks of the <HI>Ganges,</HI> and southerly to the
<PB N="85" REF="104"/>northern borders of the dominions of <HI>Tippoo Sultan.</HI> Their forces consist of two hundred thousand foot and horse, and the same number in garrison
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rennel, cxxviii.</NOTE>. In their inroads they come in clouds, and spread desolation far and wide.</P>
<P>A NEW empire is springing out of these people; <HI>Madajee Sin∣dia, a Jaghiredar</HI> of the <HI>Mahratta</HI> states (of <HI>Poonah</HI>) or mere landholder, is now successfully conquering for himself. Since the year 1783 he has extended his frontiers from <HI>Malwa</HI> towards the <HI>Jumna,</HI> possessed himself of the strong fortress of <HI>Guallior,</HI> and even gives a pension to the unhappy <HI>Mogul Shah Allum,</HI> who fled to him for protection, after having his eyes put out by a savage <HI>Rohilla</HI> chieftain, on whom <HI>Sindia</HI> revenged the cruelty by putting him to a most excruciating death. Such is the sunk state of the representative of the mighty emperors of <HI>Hindoostan. Sindia</HI> resides at <HI>Ougein,</HI> in Lat. 23° 14′, a little north of the <HI>Nerbudda</HI> river.</P>
<P>ABOUT the year 1740 <HI>Ram Rajah,</HI> a weak prince, succeeded to the throne of the <HI>Mahratta</HI> empire
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Same, lxxxii. iv.</NOTE>. His two ministers agreed to divide his kingdom; after which it became separated into two, in the manner we have described
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Same, lxxxii. iv.</NOTE>. The same species of war was continued, and for a long time they carried their plundering excursions to a great distance. At one time they sent forth two armies of horsemen, consisting of eighty thousand each
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Same, lxxxv.</NOTE>. They poured like a deluge, in 1743, over the low coun∣tries west of the <HI>Ganges,</HI> and exercised their gothic rage against every thing animate, and inanimate; the most elegant works of art fell before their brutal fury. The <HI>English</HI> were often in∣volved
<PB N="86" REF="105"/>in war with them. In 1783 peace was concluded, at the expence of all the conquests made by <HI>Goddard.</HI> We retained only the isle of <HI>Salsette,</HI> and a few isles within the gulph of <HI>Bombay.</HI></P>
<P>THE marches of these barbarians are admirably described by the author of the memoirs of the late war in <HI>Asia,</HI> p. 281, vol i. It relates to the armies of <HI>Ayder Alli,</HI> but applies equally to the military of all the powerful chieftains of <HI>India.</HI> "It may," says the ingenious writer,
<Q>perhaps afford some measure of grati∣fication to <HI>European</HI> curiosity, to be informed that the un∣disciplined troops of <HI>Asia,</HI> generally inflamed with <HI>bang,</HI> and other intoxicating drugs, pour forth, as they advance, a tor∣rent of menacing and abusive language on their adversaries. Every expression of contempt and aversion, every threat, fitted to make an impression of terror, or to excite ideas of horror, that custom readily presents, or inventive fancy can suggest, accompanies the utmost ferocity of looks, voice, and gesture. A murmuring sound, with clouds of dust, announce their approach, while they are yet at the distance of several miles. As they advance, their accents are more and more distinctly heard, until at last, with their eyes fixed and wea∣pons pointed at some individual, they devote him, with many execrations, to destruction, giving his flesh, like the heroes in <HI>Homer,</HI> and the <HI>Philistine</HI> warriors, to the dogs, and the birds of the air, and the beasts of the field. The numbers of the <HI>Asiatic</HI> armies, the ferocity of their manner, and the novelty of their appearance, would unnerve and overcome the hearts of the small <HI>European</HI> bodies that are opposed to them in the field of battle, if experience had not sufficiently
<PB N="87" REF="106"/>proved how much the silence of discipline excels barbarian noise; and uniformity of design and action, the desultory efforts of brutal force, acting by starts, and liable to the con∣tagion of accidental impression.</Q></P>
<P>THE land, from the mouth of the river of <HI>Surat,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CAPE ST. JOHN.</NOTE> makes a slight curvature as far as Cape <HI>St. John,</HI> or the <HI>Baryagazenum Promontorium.</HI> From this Cape, as far as <HI>Bombay</HI> (according to our <HI>East India</HI> pilot) the coast is skirted with islands, divided from the continent, and from each other, by very narrow channels. To the north of it is <HI>Damoon,</HI> a strong place, possessed,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">DAMOON.</NOTE> in the last century, by the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> but now in a most ruinous state. It was once besieged by <HI>Aurengzebe,</HI> who had determined to take it by storm, and fixed on a <HI>Sunday</HI> for the attack, thinking that the <HI>Christians,</HI> like the <HI>Jews,</HI> would on that day make no re∣sistance. The Governor, an old soldier, caused mass to be said at midnight; then made a sally with all his cavalry, and a strong body of infantry, into a quarter guarded by two hundred ele∣phants; he knew the dread those animals had of fire: he assailed them with fire-works. The distracted beasts, in the darkness of the night, and without their governors, rushed on their own forces, which put the army into such disorder, that before morning, half was cut to pieces by the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> and, in consequence, the siege raised.</P>
<P>THE tract that borders on the sea,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CONCAN.</NOTE> from <HI>Bombay</HI> even as far as <HI>Soonda,</HI> in Lat. 15°, is called <HI>Concan.</HI> This was the <HI>Lymirica</HI> of <HI>Arrian,</HI> ii. 171, a coast full of ports, of which he enumerates several; it once formed part of the kingdom of <HI>Visiapour.</HI> At the partition teaty it was confirmed to the <HI>Mahrattas,</HI> who now
<PB N="88" REF="107"/>possess a line of coast of three hundred miles in extent; out of which the <HI>English</HI> possess <HI>Bombay</HI> and its adjacent isles, and the strong hold of <HI>Victoria:</HI> and the <HI>Portuguese, Goa,</HI> and the antient domain belonging to that once famous <HI>emporium.</HI> The part of the <HI>Concan</HI> next to the sea is low, but at a small distance inland rises into vast strength. It is guarded by the celebrated mountains the <HI>Ghauts,</HI> which rise to a surprising height, and oppose to the west a mural front with <HI>Ghauts,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE GHAUTS.</NOTE> i. e. passes. They are the same which the <HI>Welsh</HI> call a <HI>Bwlch.</HI> From the word <HI>Ghaut</HI> the whole chain derives its name. They give entrance into the lofty, fertile, and populous plains of boundless view, which they support in the manner as buttresses do a terrace, formed on an immense scale. These run not remote from the sea from <HI>Surat</HI> to Cape <HI>Comorin,</HI> at some places seventy miles distant, but ge∣nerally forty, and in one place they advance to within six. They have lesser hills at their bases, clothed with forests, particularly of the valuable <HI>teek.</HI> The plains are blest, from their situation, with a cool and healthy air. From the sides of the mountains precipitate magnificent cataracts, forming torrents, the means of facilitating the conveyance of the timber, and giving a thousand picturesque scenes amidst the forests.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Ghauts</HI> are distinguished into the western and the eastern.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">EASTERN, &amp;c.</NOTE> The first extend, as I have described, uninterruptedly from <HI>Surat</HI> to the pass of <HI>Palicaudchery,</HI> when near <HI>Coimbetore</HI> they suddenly turn, deeply undulating to the north. Then, at the pass of <HI>Gujethetty,</HI> wind north and north-easterly as high as <HI>Amboor</HI> and <HI>Mugglee,</HI> the last about eighty miles due west of <HI>Madras.</HI> From hence they are not, by reason of the numbers
<PB N="89" REF="108"/>of branches, sufficiently marked on the maps: they seem to take a northerly course, to comprehend <HI>Aurungabad,</HI> to cross the <HI>Tapteè,</HI> and continue westerly, at irregular distances from the river, till they arrive at a certain space from <HI>Surat.</HI></P>
<P>THE whole chain, especially in the <HI>Concan,</HI> seems a connected wall, inaccessible to the summit, unless by paths worked by the hand of man, and is not to be ascended even by a single travel∣ler, without the fatiguing labor of many hours; horrible pre∣cipices, roaring cataracts, and frequent reverberating echoes, terrify the passenger on each side; often violent gusts arise, and hurry men and cattle into the black immeasurable abyss. Having attained the summit, the trouble is repaid by the magnificent prospect to the west, of the far subjacent country, broken into hills, and clothed with beautiful vegetation; the coast, the islands, and the immensity of ocean.</P>
<P>THESE <HI>Indian Appenines</HI> mark with precision the limits of the winter and summer,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SEASONS.</NOTE> or rather the wet and dry seasons, in <HI>India.</HI> They extend thirteen degrees of latitude, from <HI>Surat</HI> to Cape <HI>Comorin.</HI> They arrest the great body of clouds in their passage, and, according to the <HI>Monsoons,</HI> or periodical winds from the north-east or south-west, give, alternately, a dry season to one side, and a wet one to the other; some clouds do pass over, and give a rainy season, but at a very considerable distance to the leeward; being too high and too light to condense and fall in rain, within a small distance of this great range.</P>
<P>IN Lat. 18° 58″ is a very considerable bay, filled with islands,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BAY OF BOMBAY.</NOTE> well known by the name of <HI>Bombay,</HI> which forms the best and most secure harbour in <HI>India.</HI> This, as well as every part of
<PB N="90" REF="109"/>this coast, was the usurped property of the <HI>Portuguese;</HI> but the greatest part of this extremity was wrested from them by the <HI>Mahrattas;</HI> a few places they retained for some time, but at length all fell under the power of the new usurpers. Among the places was <HI>Bassein,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BASSEIN.</NOTE> which had been taken by <HI>Nugns d'A∣cugna,</HI> viceroy of <HI>India,</HI> in 1555, and by him strongly fortified. It was in our days seized by the <HI>Mahrattas,</HI> and again, in 1780, by the <HI>English,</HI> under General <HI>Goddard,</HI> who restored it to its late masters by the treaty of 1782.</P>
<P>DOCTOR <HI>Fryer,</HI> who visited this city about the year 1670, when it was in possession of the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> speaks of it as a very considerable place, having six churches, four convents, a college of <HI>Jesuits,</HI> and another of <HI>Franciscans.</HI></P>
<P>ABOUT twenty miles from <HI>Bassein,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">VISRABUY.</NOTE> inland, is <HI>Visrabuy,</HI> fa∣mous for its hot wells, which are in high esteem for their medicinal virtues, and accounted, by the <HI>Hindoos,</HI> of great sanctity.</P>
<P>THE principal isle is that of <HI>Salsette,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ISLE OF SAL∣SETTE.</NOTE> which is divided from the continent by a very narrow channel; it is about fifteen miles in circumference, and rich in fruits and vegetables. General <HI>Goddard</HI> included this island in his other conquests. It was wisely retained on the conclusion of the peace, and con∣firmed to us by the last peace, together with some little isles or rocks that lay within the important bay. <HI>Salsette</HI> was gallantly defended by an old man of ninety-two, who, being summoned to surrender, answered, "He was not sent for that purpose." It was not till he was slain in a bloody assault that the place was taken, but at the price of four hundred of our grena∣diers.
<PB N="91" REF="110"/>The capture gave fresh security and importance to the isle of <HI>Bombay.</HI></P>
<P>THAT island was part of the portion given to <HI>Charles</HI> II.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ISLAND OF BOM∣BAY.</NOTE> with his Queen, in 1662. His Majesty sent, in 1661, <HI>James Ley,</HI> Earl of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> a most experienced sailor, with a strong fleet, to receive it from the <HI>Portuguese.</HI> This nobleman was killed soon after his return, in the bloody sea fight against the <HI>Dutch</HI> in 1665. "He was," says <HI>Clarendon,</HI>
<Q>a man of wonderful parts in all sorts of learning, which he took more delight in than in his title
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Clarendon's Life, ii. 508.—Anderson's Dict. ii. 119.</NOTE>.</Q> <HI>Charles,</HI> in 1668, granted the island to the <HI>East India</HI> Company, under a rent of ten pounds in gold, payable annually at the Custom-house at <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>ITS length is about seven miles; it is flat, and at first was extremely unwholesome, insomuch, that
<Q>two monsoons at <HI>Bombay</HI> is the age of a man,</Q> became here a proverb; but by draining, and by prohibiting the use of putrid fish for manur∣ing the coco trees, it is rendered tolerably healthy, and is be∣come the great port and ship yard of the <HI>English</HI> in <HI>India;</HI> three hundred sail can at one time lie here in safety.</P>
<P>ON the isle is the town, the docks, and arsenal,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TOWN, DOCKS, &amp;c.</NOTE> seated in Lat. 18° 58″ N. Long. 72° 40″ E. strongly fortified; and behind them the <HI>Dungeree</HI> town for the natives. When the <HI>Portuguese</HI> ceded this place to us, it had only ten thousand inhabitants. By our mild government, in 1764 it increased to sixty thousand. Abbe <HI>Raynal</HI> gives this island a hundred thousand inhabitants, of which seven or eight thousand are sailors. Mr. <HI>Ives</HI> calls it the grand storehouse of all the <HI>Arabian</HI> and <HI>Persian</HI> commerce. The
<PB N="92" REF="111"/><HI>Arabs</HI> still keep up a considerable trade in ships of a thousand tons, either <HI>Indian</HI> built, or old <HI>Indiamen</HI> bought from the com∣pany. One article is the <HI>Kasmish</HI> raisin, a species without stones, brought from <HI>Kasmish,</HI> an isle in the <HI>Persian</HI> gulph. The exports from <HI>India</HI> are chiefly cottons, &amp;c. to a great amount; but the trade between these parts and the <HI>Persian</HI> and <HI>Arabian</HI> gulphs, has of late been much injured by caravans crossing the isthmus of <HI>Bassora,</HI> conducted by the <HI>Syrians</HI> them∣selves. The whole bay is full of shoals or rocks, yet with chan∣nels of sufficient depth of water for the skilful pilate to bring in securely the largest ships; and here, even our military fleets find conveniencies for heaving down and refitting. Admiral <HI>Watson,</HI> and again Admiral <HI>Hughes,</HI> found here every species of naval store; here his Majesty's ships winter and refit.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH <HI>Bombay</HI> is a place of very great trade, it is wholly as a magazine; its native productions are nothing in the ac∣count,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SHIP-BUILDING.</NOTE> unless you reckon ship-building. There the finest merchant ships in the world are built, and all of Teek. The durability of this timber is beyond belief, greater than that of our best <HI>English</HI> oak; it resists the worm longer than any other; but whether this be owing to the nature of the timber itself, or to the cement with which the plank is joined and covered, I cannot tell. <HI>Surat</HI> or <HI>Bombay</HI> built ships will certainly last threescore years (some say many more), in which time, how∣ever, they are generally doubled once or twice, so that the sides of an old ship are as thick as the walls of an house. Much is likewise said of the number of years they sometimes run without having occasion to use a pump; but of this I cannot speak
<PB N="93" REF="112"/>with certainty. All the repairs are effected by native carpen∣ters, and all the ships, even the largest, are built by them, and in a simplicity of manner which would astonish an <HI>European</HI> workman. M. <HI>Sonnerat,</HI> i. tab. 18, represents the <HI>Indian</HI> with all the powers of his art. The neighboring mountains supply them with <HI>teek-wood, Bengal</HI> with iron and hemp, and the adjacent forests with pines for masts.</P>
<P><HI>Bombay</HI> is also the great depôt of artillery, arms, and am∣munition, and all the means of furnishing an army. Here is also a considerable military establishment, at present under the command of Sir <HI>Robert Abercromby,</HI> K. B. President of <HI>Bombay,</HI> Governor and Commander in Chief. From hence marched the force destined to assist in the reduction of the tyrant <HI>Tippoo Sultan,</HI> and to give peace to the southern part of this vast continent.</P>
<P>A MOST unfortunate expedition took its departure from this place in 1779;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">EXPEDITIONS FROM BOMBAY.</NOTE> at which period it had not the happiness of be∣ing under the rule of a HASTINGS. A little time before, <HI>Ro∣ganaut Row,</HI> a <HI>Mahratta</HI> chieftain, fled from his country, and put himself under the protection of this presidency. He had been guardian to the young <HI>Paishwa, Naron Row,</HI> his own nephew. In the numbers of intrigues that infested the state of <HI>Poonah,</HI> a conspiracy was formed against the youth. A band of assassins were employed to murder him. <HI>Roganaut,</HI> better known by the name of <HI>Ragobah,</HI> was at the time confined in prison. The nephew flew to seek safety in his arms. In that case he would have been safe, but he could only fling himself at his feet. The youth was murdered. The uncle exchanged his prison for the <HI>Paishwa-ship.</HI> Fresh conspiracies arose, and <HI>Ro∣ganaut</HI>
<PB N="94" REF="113"/>forced to fly to the <HI>English</HI> for protection
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Account of Bombay, p. 48. 65.</NOTE>. Aspiring to the office, he flattered the <HI>English</HI> with vast advantages in case they espoused his cause; and soon prevaled on them to commence hostilities. <HI>Salsette, Baroach,</HI> and other places fell before them. The treaty of <HI>Poorunder,</HI> in 1774, secured those places to us for a time. In a little space war broke out again, fomented by <HI>Roganaut,</HI> assisted by our fears of the <HI>French,</HI> who were busy in their intrigues at the court of <HI>Poonah.</HI> In 1778 a small army,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">UNDER EGER∣TON.</NOTE> under the command of Brigadier General <HI>Egerton,</HI> assisted by a field committee, ever embarrassing, from the days of the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> to the present, was sent with him to advise, or rather to perplex the commanders. The army, which consisted of not quite four thousand men, crossed the bay to <HI>Uptah</HI> river, marched by <HI>Panwel, Campooly,</HI> and up the <HI>Bhore Ghaut</HI> to <HI>Candolah,</HI> which we found unoccupied: the object was <HI>Poonah.</HI> They reached the once fair city of <HI>Tullingaum,</HI> on <HI>January</HI> 1779. It had been burnt the night before, by the <HI>Mahrattas</HI> themselves, who appeared covering the plains, nume∣rous as the sands of the sea. They made frequent attacks on our army, and destroyed several gallant officers, and numbers of our <HI>European</HI> soldiers, and <HI>Sepoys.</HI> We made a quick retreat to the village of <HI>Worgaum.</HI> From thence our field committee sent a flag of truce, and offer of treaty. It was accepted, on con∣dition that we were to relinquish our past conquests of <HI>Salsette,</HI> and other places; to give up <HI>Roganaut</HI> and two of the field com∣mittee as hostages, and to send orders to General <HI>Goddard,</HI> on full march with the <HI>Bengal</HI> army, to return instantly home. <HI>God∣dard</HI>
<PB N="95" REF="114"/>received the humiliating orders,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">UNDER GOD∣DARD.</NOTE> but rejected them with indignation, and continued his route, marked in every place with glory and victory
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the history of this disgraceful business, in a little 4to. pamphlet, published at Breck∣nock in 1794, entitled, The Expedition of Tullingaum, &amp;c. and the War in Asia, i. p. p. 11. 65. 69.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN <HI>January</HI> 1781, after the conquest of <HI>Bassein,</HI> that able officer assembled his troops at <HI>Vizrabuy,</HI> and in order to make a diversion in favor of <HI>Madras,</HI> then in imminent danger, ad∣vanced to <HI>Campooly,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Candolah,</HI> which the enemy had possessed themselves of in great force, but they soon were driven from their arduous station. It should seem that <HI>Tul∣lingaum</HI> had been rebuilt since the last expedition, for the Gene∣ral found it just burnt, and <HI>Poonah</HI> filled with combustibles, ready for the same fate. He found an army of seventy thou∣sand horse and foot, ready to oppose his little body of six thou∣sand; yet such was the terror of the foe, that they again burnt the town of <HI>Tullingaum.</HI> An <HI>Indian</HI> town is as soon rebuilt as destroyed; and every preparation was made for burning <HI>Poonah,</HI> by filling the houses with straw, and removing the inhabitants to the strong hold of <HI>Sattarah.</HI> Thus circumstanced, our Gene∣ral thought proper to retreat, in order to assist, with part of his forces, his friends then besieged in <HI>Tellicherry,</HI> by <HI>Sardar Khan,</HI> a general of <HI>Ayder Alli</HI>'s. This movement was conducted with such secrecy and skill, that the whole of the artillery and heavy stores reached the foot of the pass in safety, and without the smallest interruption from the enemy, who were astonished, on
<PB N="96" REF="115"/>the morning of the 18th of <HI>April,</HI> to find that our post at <HI>Can dolah</HI> had been deserted during the preceding night. Ten thou∣sand of the bravest undisciplined infantry in <HI>Hindoostan,</HI> followed him to the subjacent country; they consisted of <HI>Arabs</HI> and <HI>Sindies,</HI> who attempted to harass him in his march, but in vain: He repelled every attack with great slaughter. His own loss consisted only of a few camp followers and common soldiers. I observe at this time <HI>Hurry Punt,</HI> afterwards our friend in the campaigns in the <HI>Mysore,</HI> in 1792, among the hostile commanders. <HI>Goddard</HI> returned with fresh laurels to <HI>Bombay,</HI> which even want of success could not sere.</P>
<P>BESIDES the two islands I have mentioned,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ELEPHANTA, &amp;c.</NOTE> scattered over the found are several others, such as <HI>Caranja, Elephanta, Hog, Butcher,</HI> and <HI>Green</HI> island; most of them very small; but all of them rising in one part or other into a lofty hill.</P>
<P>OPPOSITE to <HI>Caranja</HI> stood the antient <HI>Calliana</HI> of <HI>Ar∣rian,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CALLIANA.</NOTE> ii. 171, a famous and much frequented <HI>emporium.</HI> It had been a common port to all nations till the <HI>Romans</HI> made a conquest of <HI>Egypt:</HI> after which they prohibited every country from entering the <HI>Red</HI> sea, and monopolized all the trade of <HI>India:</HI> every port on this coast was shut against foreigners, and that of <HI>Calliana</HI> is particularized by <HI>Arrian.</HI> The remains of that city were observed by Doctor <HI>Fryer.</HI> But what gives this neighborhood great celebrity, is the vast ca∣verns, the works of very old times, discovered in the isles of <HI>Salsette,</HI> and of <HI>Elephanta,</HI> and of certain other places hereafter to be pointed out.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">FAMOUS CA∣VERNS.</NOTE> The celebrated M. NIEBUHR, who visited those caves, and those in <HI>Salsette,</HI> in 1764, has given numbers of
<PB N="97" REF="116"/>elegant plates of the various figures, attended with descriptions. See his second volume of Travels, p. 25 to 33. Mr. <HI>Gough</HI> has also published a most elaborate account of these wonderful caves, printed by <HI>John Nichol,</HI> in 1785.—Finally, descriptions may be found in the viith and viiith volumes of the <HI>Archaelogia,</HI> by the pen of Messrs. <HI>Mackneil, Hunter, Pyke,</HI> and <HI>Boon.</HI> The accounts are of considerable length, drawn up with great accuracy, and attended with figures of the principal antiquities. Vast hills have been excavated by human art, most probably for religious purposes. Mr. <HI>Ives</HI> gives the ground plan of that at <HI>Elephanta,</HI> by which it appears to be a hundred and eighty feet, by a hun∣dred and fifty in dimensions: part is supported by vast pillars, of a rounded form, swelling at the middle, resting on a square base: on the summit of which, at each corner, is a sitting ape. In the entrance are left pillars, nearly similar, but plain, and without figures.</P>
<P>THE inside is divided into several square apartments, the greatest propt by the pillars above described, and is a hundred and four feet square. At each angle it is divided into three small square rooms; and at one of the entrances within (for there are three) is another, all, perhaps, chapels. These are expressed in Mr. <HI>Pyke</HI>'s plan.</P>
<P>IN every cave, described by these curious travellers, are most amazing numbers of sculptures, all cut out of the live rock, of human figures, extravagant deities, monsters, animals, foliage, and all that can astonish and bewilder the imagination. Many represent idols of the <HI>Indian</HI> mythology, figures half beast and half man; many faces and many hands to the same sculpture;
<PB N="98" REF="117"/>and often the <HI>Cobra de Capello,</HI> that dreadful snake, which is attendant on several of the incarnations of <HI>Vistchenou.</HI> A fish is one, which assists to explain the object of the sculptures and uses of the excavations.</P>
<P>THESE caverns are the haunts of monstrous serpents. <HI>Hamil∣ton,</HI> i. 239, tells us, that on firing his fusil, to enjoy the thunder∣ing echo of the report, he disturbed a <HI>Boa,</HI> fifteen feet in length, and two feet in girth, from its antient seat, which put the tra∣veller to speedy flight, and an end to his curiosity.</P>
<P>MOST of the figures are colossal, from twelve to twenty-three feet high. Some of them, with all their extravagancies, are said to be finely executed: many are cross leg'd, in their attitude of prayer; many have rosaries, which prove that these places were objects of devotion.</P>
<P>THE woman with three faces and four arms is engraven in Mr. <HI>Pyke</HI>'s account. I beg leave to make a few remarks on that figure: round her neck are five necklaces, rich in pearls and gems, with pendent jewels; her hair is long, and hangs in beautiful ringlets; her ears (not her ear-rings as they are called) hang to a vast length, exactly in the <HI>Malabar</HI> mode; and her head∣dress is conic, in the <HI>Chinese</HI> fashion, which might have been in use in early times. The last is dropt; the strange deformity of long ears are still retained: so far is certainly of eastern sculpture.</P>
<P>BUT what can be said to the figures found in another cave, in the neighborhood of <HI>Bombay,</HI> not expressed by name: they are engraven in volume vii. of the <HI>Archaelogia;</HI> some have the sausage curl, others the cochlear twirl, in the hair, and others
<PB N="99" REF="118"/>the rich braid of pearl; all resembling, in some degree, the fantastic variety in the head-dresses of the <HI>Roman</HI> ladies, with∣out the lest trace of <HI>oriental</HI> fashion.</P>
<P>I SHALL conclude with saying, that the cave of <HI>Elephanta</HI> takes its name from an elephant, with a lesser on its back, cut on the outside of the cave; and in a passage is the rude figure of a horse, called that of <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, to whom the <HI>Indians</HI> attribute these mighty works, as we <HI>Welsh</HI> do every thing stu∣pendous to our favorite <HI>Arthur.</HI> I mention this tradition to shew its great antiquity, as well as that of the excavations them∣selves. <HI>Arrian,</HI> in his <HI>Periplus maris Erythraei,</HI> ii. 166, says that there were near <HI>Barygaza,</HI> foundations of camps, antient cha∣pels, altars, and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, great wells, all attributed to the <HI>Macedonian</HI> hero.</P>
<P>THE idols mentioned here are quite diminutive to some in the <HI>Soobahship</HI> of <HI>Cashmere,</HI> in recesses excavated in the moun∣tain, which are called (says the <HI>Ayeen,</HI> ii. 208) <HI>Surnmii,</HI> and are pre∣tended to have been the winter retreat of the antient inhabitants; one of the figures was eighty ells high; there was a woman of fifty, and a child of fifteen. In one of these <HI>Surnmii</HI> was found a tomb, and in that a coffin; in which was a corpse preserved by medical preparations: one would suppose that the customs of the <HI>Tartars</HI> had been observed in this place, and burning the bodies at that time not in use.</P>
<P>THE method of travelling which begins at <HI>Surat,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TRAVELLING IN INDIA.</NOTE> and is con∣tinued through most parts of <HI>India,</HI> is by oxen. The ox sup∣plies the use of the horse; the smaller sort serve as pads, the larger are used in drawing a kind of carriage called a hackerie.
<PB N="100" REF="119"/>The beasts are commonly white, have black noses, and large perpendicular horns: they are also remarkable, like most other <HI>Indian</HI> and <HI>African</HI> cattle, for a hunch rising between the shoulders. Those of <HI>Guzerat</HI> are most remarkably large, and in great request through most parts of <HI>India.</HI> The hunch is highly esteemed as a delicacy, salted and boiled. When they are fitted for the saddle or the draft, a cord, and some∣times a piece of wood is passed through the nose from nostril to nostril, and a cord extended from each end, as a bridle. M. <HI>Sonnerat,</HI> vol. i. tab. 7, gives a print of the <HI>Hackerie,</HI> or <HI>Gari,</HI> as it is called in <HI>India,</HI> and all its apparatus. In <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> if these creatures are forced out of their usual slow pace, it is too well known that they will faint, or lie down under their burthen; but at <HI>Bombay,</HI> they trot and gallop as naturally as horses, and are equally as serviceable in every other respect, ex∣cept that, by their being subject to a loose habit of body, they sometimes incommode the traveller by the filth thrown upon him by the continual motion of their tails. Whenever they get to the end of the journey, the driver always alights, and puts the near bullock in the other's place; then he puts his hand into both their mouths, and after pulling out the froth, mounts his box again and drives back. It seems this precaution is absolutely necessary, for as they travel at the rate of seven or eight miles an hour, they would otherwise be in danger of suffocation.</P>
<P>BESIDES the large species which I have engraven in vol. i. tab. ii. of my <HI>Hist. Quadr.</HI> is a diminutive species, tab. iii, common at <HI>Surat,</HI> not bigger than a large dog, which has a fierce look, but is trained to draw children in their little carts. I have been
<PB N="101" REF="120"/>informed, that a bull and cow from, I believe the <HI>Tanjore</HI> coun∣try, have been imported into <HI>England,</HI> the height of the first not exceeding nineteen inches, and of the last not eighteen.</P>
<P>BEING on the subject of animals,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SHEEP.</NOTE> I shall mention a species of the next genus, the sheep. That called <HI>Cabrito</HI> by the <HI>Por∣tuguese,</HI> is a very long legged kind, and of a very disgusting appearance. At <HI>Goa</HI> it is sometimes saddled and bridled, and serves instead of a poney, and will carry a child of twelve years of age.</P>
<P>ABOUT <HI>Bombay</HI> is found the squirrel, <HI>Hist. Quadr.</HI> ii. N<SUP>o</SUP> 336, known by the name of the place; it is very large, and of a pur∣ple color.</P>
<P>I MUST now digress to a very different class.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERPENTS.</NOTE> The tribe of snakes is very numerous in <HI>India.</HI> I think their great historio∣grapher, <HI>M. de la Cepede,</HI> enumerates forty-four species already known. I shall only mention the most curious: I am uncertain whether they are quite local. Mr. <HI>Ives</HI> speaks of some found in this island or neighborhood; the <HI>Cobra Capello</HI> I shall describe some time hence. Mr. <HI>Ives</HI> relates, that the <HI>Cobra Manilla</HI> is only a foot long, of a bluish color, haunting old walls. Its bite is as fatal as that of the <HI>Cobra Capello,</HI> which kills in the space of a quarter of an hour. The <HI>Cobra de Aurellia</HI> is only six in∣ches long, and not thicker than the quill of a crow; it is apt to creep into the ear, and occasion death by madness. The sand snake is small, but not less fatal than the others. The <HI>Palmira,</HI> with a viperine head, and varied body, is four feet long, yet in no part thicker than a swan's quill.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="121"/>AMONG the variety of beautiful shells found on the coast,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TURBO SCALA∣RIS.</NOTE> is the noted <HI>Turbo Scalaris,</HI> or <HI>Wentle-trap,</HI> a shell seldom an inch and a quarter long, of a pearly color, and with about seven spires, each having several elegant ridges, crossing them from the first spire to the last; a sine representation of the winding staircase. A painter I knew, filled with the <HI>Concha-mania,</HI> once gave fifty-six guineas for three of them, one alone he valued at twenty-five.</P>
<P>SOME few other things, respecting the natural history of <HI>Bombay</HI> and its neighborhood, may be here taken notice of. The diseases of <HI>India</HI> begin to shew themselves in this place,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BARBIERS, A DISEASE.</NOTE> but I shall only attend to the <HI>Barbiers,</HI> which is more prevalent on this side of the peninsula of <HI>India</HI> than the other. It is a palsy, which takes its name from <HI>Beriberii,</HI> or the sheep, as the afflicted totter in their gait like that animal when seized with a giddiness. Its symptoms are both a numbness, a privation of the use of the limbs, a tremor, and an attendant titillation usually not fatal, but extremely difficult of cure. It comes on slowly, and usually in the rainy season; but if a person drinks hastily, when heated, a large draught of <HI>Toddy,</HI> or the liquor of the coco nut, the attack of the disease is very sudden. <HI>Bontius, (English</HI> edition, p. 1), treats largely of the cure. He recommends strongly baths or somentations of the <HI>Nochile</HI> of the <HI>Malabars,</HI> or <HI>Lagondi</HI> of the <HI>Malays,</HI> or the <HI>Jasminum Indicum.</HI></P>
<P>THE phoenomenon of small fish appearing in the rainy sea∣son,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">FISHES FALLING ON LAND.</NOTE> in places before dry, is as true as it is surprising. The natives begin to fish for them the tenth day after the first rains,
<PB N="103" REF="122"/>and they make a common dish at the tables. Many are the modes of accounting for this annual appearance. It has been suggested that the spawn may have been brought by the water fowl, or may have been caught up by the <HI>Typhons,</HI> which rage at the commencement of the wet season, and be conveyed in the torrents of rain. I can only give an explanation much less violent: That these fishes never had been any where but near the places where they are found. That they have had a pre∣existent state, and began life in form of frogs; that it had been the <HI>Rana paradoxa</HI> of <HI>Gm. Lin.</HI> iii. p. 10. 55. Their trans∣formation is certainly wonderful. I refer the reader to <HI>Seba,</HI> i. p. 125, tab. 78; and to <HI>Merian</HI>'s <HI>Surinam,</HI> p. 71, tab. 71, in which are full accounts of the wonderful phoenomenon of these transmuted reptiles, which complete their last transformation in the first rains.</P>
<P>ALL kinds of reptiles appear about that season, among others,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TOADS, VAST.</NOTE> toads of most enormous sizes. Mr. <HI>Ives</HI> mentions one that he supposed weighed between four and five pounds; and measured, from the toe of the fore to that of the hind leg, twenty-two inches.</P>
<P>I NOW leave the bay, after saying that the tides here, and at <HI>Cam∣bay,</HI> rise to an amazing height; this must be understood, when they are pent up in bays or gulphs, for on the open shore they do not rise above a foot and a half. Into the eastern side flows the river <HI>Pen,</HI> with stoney and steep banks. Immediately beyond the mouth, the land resumes its course.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ISLES OF KA∣NARA AND HUNARY.</NOTE> The isles of <HI>Kanara</HI> and <HI>Hunary,</HI> appear at no great distance from shore, small and lofty. <HI>Sevatjee</HI> seized on the first, in defiance of every effort
<PB N="104" REF="123"/>of the <HI>English</HI> at <HI>Bombay.</HI> He fortified this little spot. Finding ourselves too weak to remove so dangerous a neighbor, we stir∣red up against him the <HI>Siddee,</HI> or admiral to <HI>Aurengzebe.</HI> This brought on several sharp naval actions
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orme's Fragments, 122.</NOTE>. The <HI>Siddee</HI> seized on the neighboring <HI>Hunary;</HI> and each party carrying on a cruel war, gave importance to these inconsiderable spots.</P>
<P><HI>Choule</HI> and <HI>Victoria,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHOULE.</NOTE> and several other small places, are given in the charts on this coast. <HI>Dunda Rajapore</HI> was a port, the rendezvous of <HI>Aurengzebe</HI>'s fleet, under the command of his <HI>Siddee.</HI> The <HI>Siddee</HI> was an office formed at the time when the <HI>Mogul</HI> empire first extended itself to these coasts. Its duty was like that of the <HI>Comes Littoris Saxonici,</HI> on the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>British</HI> shores, and was here intended to repel the insults of the <HI>Mala∣bar</HI> or <HI>Portuguese</HI> cruizers; as the <HI>Roman Comes</HI> was those of the <HI>Norman</HI> rovers. In the year 1682 there were a hundred and twenty <HI>Gallivats,</HI> and fifteen Grabs; and a vast army encamped in the neighborhood.</P>
<P>Correspondent to them, were <HI>Nitrias,</HI> the modern <HI>Newtya, Tynadis, Muziris,</HI> and numbers of other ports mentioned by the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> historians.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PIRATE COAST.</NOTE> This is the <HI>Pirate coast,</HI> and extends almost from <HI>Bombay</HI> till we have arrived very near to <HI>Goa.</HI> The <HI>Romans</HI> were obliged to put on board their merchant∣ships a number of archers to defend them against the attacks of the pirates
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Plin. Nat. Hist. lib. vi. c. 23.</NOTE>, which, according to the <HI>Universal History,</HI> x. p. 267, are said to have been <HI>Arabians.</HI> Mr. <HI>Rennel</HI> gives an admi∣rable description of this extent of free-booters.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="124"/><Q>PERHAPS there are few coasts so much broken into small bays and harbours, and that at the same time have so straight a general outline. This multitude of small ports, uninter∣rupted view along shore, and elevated coasts, savourable to distant vision, have sitted this coast for the seat of piracy; and the alternate land and sea breezes that prevail during a great part of the year, oblige vessels to navigate very near the shore. No wonder then that <HI>Pliny</HI> should notice them in his time as committing depredations on the <HI>Roman East India</HI> trade; and although a temporary check has been given them in the destruction of <HI>Angria</HI>'s fleets, &amp;c. yet we may expect that they will continue the practice while commerce lasts. They are protected by the shallowness of their ports, and the strength of the country within. As pirates, they have greater natural advantages than those of <HI>Barbary,</HI> who, being com∣pelled to roam far from their coasts, have expensive outsets; here the prizes come to their own doors, and the cruizers may lie secure in port until the prey is discovered.</Q></P>
<P>THE vessels used by these pirates are of two kinds.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">GRABS.</NOTE> The larger are called <HI>Grabs:</HI> a few have three masts, and carry three hundred tons; the lesser have only two masts, and are of the burden of a hundred and fifty tons. On the main deck, under the fore-castle, are mounted two cannons, nine or ten pounders, pointing forwards, and firing over the prow
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orme, i. p. 409.</NOTE>, which is constructed like that of a <HI>Mediterranean</HI> galley. The cannons on the broadside are from six to nine pounders.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="125"/><HI>Gallivats</HI> are large row boats,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">GALLIVATS.</NOTE> built like the <HI>Grabs,</HI> but do not exceed seventy tons. The larger carry six or eight cannons, from two to four pounders: the lesser only petteraroes: but both are furnished with forty or fifty stout oars, which are rowed at the rate of four miles an hour: both <HI>Grabs</HI> and <HI>Gallivats</HI> are crowded with men. Eight or ten of the latter, and forty or fifty of the former, compose <HI>Angria</HI>'s principal fleet for attack∣ing ships of force. They scruple not to make prize of every one which does not condescend to purchase their passports.</P>
<P>As soon as they descry a sail they slip from port, and sail as fast as the wind: or, if it is calm, soon reach the object with their oars: the <HI>Gallivats</HI> taking the <HI>Grabs</HI> in tow. They then assemble on the stern of the chace within cannon shot, and at∣tempt to dismast her. As soon as they succeed, they surround and batter her on all sides. If the ship makes an obstinate de∣fence, a number of <HI>Gallivats,</HI> with two or three hundred men in each, board her sword in hand from all quarters, and in the same instant. I am obliged to Mr. <HI>Orme</HI>'s classical history for this account.</P>
<P>THIS coast was equally infamous in the days of <HI>Pliny,</HI> possibly long before, even as long as commerce became considerable in these seas. In lib. vi. c. 23, he warns the <HI>Roman</HI> merchants of the dangers of this route, from touching at <HI>Muziris,</HI> not only because it is not abundant in articles of commerce, but as it borders upon the <HI>Piratae,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">HYDRAS.</NOTE> who had a port at <HI>Hydras,</HI> some write it <HI>Nitrias;</HI> yet I think the historian intended the first, allusive to the fabled serpent which makes every thing its prey. Their ports of this coast are truly described by <HI>Pliny</HI> to be shallow,
<PB REF="126"/>

</FIGURE>
<PB N="107" REF="127"/>so that the commerce was then carried on, as it is in many places to this day, in small boats, which convey the merchan∣dize to the ships, which are obliged to anchor at a distance from land. <HI>Ptolemy</HI> also mentions the ports of these pirates, or the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and gives a lift of them. It is not improbable, but that these pests of the sea continued from that time to the present: but certain it is, that <HI>Vasco de Gama</HI> found them on this coast in full force, in his first voyage to <HI>India. Marco Polo,</HI> who travelled in 1269, describes, at p. 145, their piracies in those days, both in the seas of <HI>Guzerat</HI> and <HI>Malabar.</HI> He says they took their wives and children with them, and passed the whole summer on the sea. They commonly had twenty ships in a fleet, which they ranged at the distance of five miles from each other, making a line of a hundred miles. As soon as any one described a merchant ship it made a signal, by smoke, to the rest; so there was no possibility of escape. They offered no violence to the crew; they only plundered the vessel, and set the people on shore.</P>
<P>IN our days many of the ports of the modern pirates have been brought into notice, by the attempts to extirpate these nests of thieves, and with a temporary success. Their principal fastnesses were in <HI>Victoria, Severn-droog, Sunderdoo, Vingorla</HI> rocks, in Lat. 15° 22′ 30″, six or seven miles from the shore; and I should have given particular pre-eminence to <HI>Gheriah,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">GHERIAH.</NOTE> the port of the chief pirate <HI>Angria,</HI> nearly midway between <HI>Bombay</HI> and <HI>Goa.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Victoria</HI> is the name we bestowed on one of these fastnesses. The <HI>Indian</HI> one was <HI>Bancoote.</HI> This we retain, not only because
<PB N="108" REF="128"/>it has a good harbour, and great trade in salt, but because the neighborhood abounds with cattle, with which we can supply the garrison and navy at <HI>Bombay.</HI> The country is peopled with <HI>Mahomctans,</HI> who have no scruple to part with them, as the <HI>Hindoos</HI> have

<P>THE reduction of these piratical powers added greatly to the glory of the <HI>British</HI> arms.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SIR WILLIAM JAMES.</NOTE> <HI>Severn-droog,</HI> and five other of the forts on this coast, were taken in <HI>April</HI> 1755, by Commodore <HI>James,</HI> commander of the <HI>East India</HI> Company's marine forces in <HI>India</HI>

<P>I HERE mention <HI>Dabul,</HI> a neighboring place,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">DABUL.</NOTE> to contrast the conduct of the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> who, in 1555, took it with un∣common instances of barbarity. They set fire to it in four places. The male inhabitants escaped; but the savage heroes (for we cannot deny the character of heroism) put to the sword the defenceless sex and innocent children

<P>THE important city of <HI>Goa</HI> stands on an island of the same name,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ISLE OF GOA.</NOTE> in Lat. 15° 28′ 20″, in a fine bay, a few leagues lower. The city was for a great length of time the most magnificent in <HI>India.</HI> The churches and palaces of the inhabitants were of
<PB N="110" REF="131"/>great grandeur and splendor. It stands elevated, in form of an amphitheatre, on the banks of a most beautiful bay. The country rises gently into hills, finely wooded, and the scene is varied with churches, convents, and villas, and the distance bounded by the <HI>Ghauts,</HI> soaring with aweful majesty. The <HI>Algoada</HI> fort defends the entrance on the northern side. All this is shewn in Mr. <HI>Dalrymple</HI>'s elegant views. Two rivers flow from the <HI>Balagat</HI> mountains, and their mouths nearly meet opposite to the harbour. On one, which was called the <HI>Ganges,</HI> a few leagues from the sea, stood the <HI>Nelcynda. Arrian,</HI> ii. 173, says, that the ships which took in part of their lading there, fell down, and received the rest while they lay at anchor before <HI>Barace,</HI> a town near its mouth, or in the modern canal of <HI>Bardez.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Indian</HI> name of <HI>Goa</HI> was <HI>Tricurii,</HI> or the isle of <HI>Thirty Villages;</HI> it is said to have been peopled by <HI>Moorish</HI> merchants, who had been banished from different ports of <HI>Malabar,</HI> and formed soon a very flourishing settlement. This is said to have happened at no very distant period before the arrival of the <HI>Portuguese.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN the great <HI>Albuquerque</HI> entered on his vice-royalty,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SEIZED BY ALBU∣QUERQUE.</NOTE> it was a most opulent place, and strongly fortified. It was at that time subject to <HI>Zabaim,</HI> a potent monarch, who was then engaged in war with divers tributary princes. <HI>Timoia,</HI> a neigh∣boring pirate, who had submitted to the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> strongly advised the <HI>Christian</HI> General to seize the opportunity of attack∣ing <HI>Goa,</HI> representing its great opulence, and the honor and wealth that would attend his success. <HI>Albuquerque</HI> listened to
<PB N="111" REF="132"/>his advice, and after several assaults made himself master of the city by an agreement with the inhabitants. This happened on <HI>February</HI> 16, 1510. The citizens took the oaths of allegiance to <HI>Emmanuel;</HI> he found in the place immense quantities of ammunition, forty great cannon, and in the docks forty men of war, and in the stables numbers of fine <HI>Persian</HI> and <HI>Arabian</HI> horses
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Osorio, ii. p. 4.</NOTE>. He himself resided in the royal palace: the fame of his valor and prudence spread far and wide. He received em∣bassies from several of the <HI>Indian</HI> monarchs, and even was encouraged to send an envoy to the sophy of <HI>Persia.</HI></P>
<P>Unfortuately a mutinous spirit pervaded his army, and even his principal officers. This naturally infected his new subjects, who, repenting their disloyalty, and disgusted with their sudden submission to a foreign and <HI>Christian</HI> yoke, conveyed their sen∣timents to their late sovereign. He assembled a mighty army on the continent, and notwithstanding every endeavor of the able <HI>Albuquerque,</HI> effected a landing on the island. The <HI>Por∣tuguese</HI> defended themselves with great valor, but finding the place no longer tenable, their commander determined to retire. He embarked with great secrecy every thing that was necessary; when, on the 30th of <HI>May</HI> of the same year, after a sharp con∣flict, he made good his retreat to <HI>Rapander,</HI> a neighboring town, where he resolved to winter
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Osorio, ii. p. 13.</NOTE>. <HI>Zabaim</HI> proved a brave and active enemy: <HI>Albuquerque</HI> was more than once obliged to re∣move his quarters: at length, receiving a strong reinforcement of <HI>Portuguese,</HI> and other supplies, he renewed his attempt on <HI>Goa,</HI>
<PB N="112" REF="133"/>and, after several sharp actions, made himself again master of the city, by a most fierce and bloody assault; the defence being equally obstinate as the attack.</P>
<P>FROM that moment the able Vice-roy determined to make <HI>Goa</HI> the capital of his master's new acquired dominion in <HI>India:</HI> he gave it every strength his military skill could suggest, and every encouragement that his wisdom and commercial know∣lege could invent. The success was, for a long series of years, equal to the greatness of the design, and it flourished with un∣rivalled splendor. It became the center of the riches of <HI>India,</HI> and one of the greatest marts in the universe. At length the common consequences of wealth, pride, luxury, effeminacy, and every species of fraud, cruelty, and oppression possessed the minds of these once brave and gallant people; they degenerated into every vile action; and thought nothing wrong that brought in advantage. They established here an inquisition to enslave the minds of the people. They persecuted the poor natives in every shape, and in every place. The Abbe <HI>Raynal,</HI> in most animated terms, describes the sad change. To him I refer the reader. After the fall of the <HI>Portuguese</HI> empire in <HI>India,</HI> a priest of <HI>Goa</HI> being asked, when he thought his nation might again resume its power, sensibly replied—"As soon as your wickedness shall exceed that of my people." Let me only say, that the measure of their iniquity being filled, they were beaten, and expelled from the very seats conquered by the intrepidity and chivalry of their ancestors; and that by a small nation, who, sallying from the fens of <HI>Holland,</HI> by temperance, wisdom, and fortitude, drove from almost every part of <HI>India</HI>
<PB N="113" REF="134"/>that nation, whose monarchs so long had tyrannised over them in <HI>Europe. Goa,</HI> and some few places on the <HI>Malabar</HI> coast, were left to them. Most of them are now deserted, and fallen to ruin. <HI>Goa</HI> barely keeps up its head: a Vice-roy, a man of rank, is still sent here; a shew of state is kept up, but nothing of ter∣ritory is left, except the island, and the two peninsulas that form the harbour. The port of <HI>Goa</HI> is one of the finest in <HI>India,</HI> and in the hands of the <HI>English</HI> or <HI>Dutch</HI> would be a wealthy and flourishing settlement; but its commercial consequence is sunk to nothing: and such is the state of <HI>Diu</HI> and <HI>Damoon</HI> if they still remain in their hands.</P>
<P>IT was at this place that the Apostle of the <HI>Indies,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ST. FRANCIS DE XAVIER.</NOTE> St. <HI>Francis de Xavier,</HI> landed, when he undertook his great mission for the conversion of the <HI>Hindoos.</HI> He was born at the castle <HI>Xavier,</HI> at the foot of the <HI>Pyrenees,</HI> in 1506. He became the friend of <HI>Ignatius Loyola,</HI> and, in concert with him, laid the plan for the society of <HI>Jesus.

Before their arrival he, on <HI>January</HI> 5, attacked and took a few places of small consequence.

<Q>in <HI>Onore</HI> was put to the sword; the carnage was great; we trampled thick on dead bodies that were strewed in the way. It was rather shocking to humanity; but such are but secondary considera∣tions to a soldier whose bosom glows with heroic glory, and

<P>THUS strengthened,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ASCENT OF THE GHAUTS.</NOTE> he began his toilsome ascent up the <HI>Hussein Ghurry Ghaut,</HI> with all windings, not less than three miles in extent, and strongly fortified at every turning.
<Q>Luck∣ily it happened,</Q> says Mr. <HI>Sheen,</HI>
<Q>that the commander knew nothing of this defile, otherwise it would have been madness for him to have attempted it; for if the enemy had made any tolerable defence, it would have been impregnable: but it was defended only by the wild undisciplined troops of the native <HI>Polygars.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>HOWEVER, the General's want of information was the cause of our success; for in the evening, part of the eleventh batta∣lion, which I belong to, the light company of the <HI>Bombay Euro∣peans,</HI> and part of the fifteenth battalion of <HI>Sepoys,</HI> began the attack, and took the first barrier with very little opposition.</Q></P>
<P><Q>WHEN we came to the second, we were alarmed at the prodigious number and strong position of the enemy; but finding it no less dangerous to retreat than to advance, we charged home in all quarters, when the motley crew gave way and fled, leaving about five hundred killed and wounded.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">ITS HISTORY.</NOTE> by the following accident. The son of the reigning Queen of <HI>Canhara</HI> fled to <HI>Ayder,</HI> imploring his protection and his assistance to put him in possession of his kingdom, which his mother kept from him in a most iniquitous manner. <HI>Ayder</HI> acceded to his petition, marched against the usurpress, defeated her army, and, in the end, reconciled the contending parties. She received <HI>Ayder</HI> with every mark of respect, and even lodged him in the royal palace. Under this mask she, in concert with her husband (for she had married a second, a <HI>Brahmin</HI>) determined on his destruction by the most horrid means, that of blowing him up in the palace with gunpowder. A subordinate <HI>Brahmin</HI> dis∣covered
<PB N="119" REF="140"/>the plot: he appeared before <HI>Ayder</HI> in presence of the Queen, the King, and whole court, and charged the conspirators with their crime. The trial commenced on the spot, the charge was proved, the Queen and her husband put to death, and the king confined. Possibly the complaint of the son was uncon∣stitutional, for the throne of <HI>Canhara</HI> is said to have always been filled with a female, who had the privilege of marrying whom she pleased, but exempted herself from the cruel rite of burning with the body of her husband, in the manner that the affec∣tionate spouses of her subjects were accustomed to do.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SEIZED BY AYDER.</NOTE> <HI>Ayder Alli</HI> seized on the kingdom, and all the immense treasure of the capital; but, what he thought of more importance, was a line of coast, which flattered his ambition with the hopes of becom∣ing as invincible by sea as he had hitherto been by land.</P>
<P>FROM the time of the storming <HI>Onore,</HI> the General's conduct was totally altered. He grew irresolute respecting his proceed∣ings, paid no attention to the plan he was to execute by the orders of the Presidency, and neglected every communication with them. Before this, he was held in high estimation, as an officer
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hon. Charles Grevile, British India, iii. p. 843.</NOTE> and a man. He remained a long time in a state of de∣spondency. At length, actuated by a passion before latent, he suddenly took the resolution of performing the service he was appointed to. He ascended the <HI>Ghaut,</HI> in the manner related. He appeared before <HI>Bednore,</HI> at that time wholly defenseless.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BEDNORE SUR∣RENDERED.</NOTE> It was then governed by <HI>Hyat Saib,</HI> a person of consummate abili∣lities, and firm fidelity towards his master. He reflected on the
<PB N="120" REF="141"/>impossibility of resistance, and the danger of having both the province and city desolated by the rage of the conqueror. He secretly sent to <HI>Matthews,</HI> as soon as he had entered the plains, to offer to surrender the place, and to deliver to the <HI>English</HI> all the treasures; on condition, that the persons and property of the inhabitants should be secured, and himself continued in the government under the <HI>English,</HI> with all the power he had under <HI>Ayder.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Matthews,</HI> now in possession of the treasures of ages, and dazzled by the heaps of the gems of <HI>Hindoostan,</HI> such strong temptations rose in view as instantly to dissipate every virtuous idea he might before have possessed. Avarice and rapacity oc∣cupied their seats, and he rose like the fiend <HI>Mammon</HI> with all his attributes. The General seized on all the treasures, and im∣prisoned <HI>Hyat Saib.</HI> He as suddenly released him, and made to him a pretended restitution of all his wealth
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lieut. Sheen's Letter, in Capt. Oake's Narrative, p. 77.</NOTE>. Strong suspicions of the General's conduct pervaded the army. To allay their murmurs, he prevaled on <HI>Hyat Saib</HI> to present the troops with about the value of twenty thousand pounds in <HI>pagodas.</HI> He had also quarreled with <HI>Macleod, Mackenzie Humberston,</HI> and major <HI>Shaw,</HI> after the capture of <HI>Bednore,</HI> on the subject of pre∣cedency with the company's troops. They quitted the army, and hastened to <HI>Bombay,</HI> to lay their complaints before the Pre∣sidency. Their absence was most fatally missed. The General now, for the first time, sent dispatches to the Presidency, filled with false statements of affairs, and complaints against the army, from the generals to the very common men.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="142"/>AT <HI>Bednore</HI> he found (to a patriotic commander) a more im∣portant acquisition than any treasures.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">VAST MAGA∣ZINES, FOUN∣DRY, &amp;c.</NOTE> All <HI>Ayder</HI>'s principal ma∣gazines, a very fine foundry for brass cannon, a powder manu∣factory, and immense stores of every kind
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hon. Charles Grevile's British India, iii. p. 844.</NOTE>. <HI>Matthews</HI> did not make a true estimate of this species of treasure; his avarice made him neglect his security, yet he weakened his army by making detachments to every place where the prospect of plunder could allure him. He neglected the strong passes into the <HI>Mysore,</HI> which, secured, he might have rested safely against all the efforts of the returning <HI>Tippoo.</HI> Among other places he sent a detachment to <HI>Annampour,</HI> a strong fort, adjacent to <HI>Bednore,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ANNAMPOUR.</NOTE> which <HI>Ayder</HI> had made the depôt of the rest of his treasure. The place was taken by storm. Let Lieutenant <HI>Sheen</HI> relate the disgraceful event.—<Q>When a practicable breach was effected, orders were issued for a storm, and no quarters; which was immediately put in execution,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">HORRID CRUEL∣TIES.</NOTE> and every man put to the sword, except one horseman, who made his escape, after being wounded in three different places. A dreadful sight then presented itself; above four hundred beautiful women, either killed or wounded with the bayonet, expiring in one another's arms, while the private soldiers were committing every kind of outrage, and plundering them of their jewels, the officers not being able to restrain them
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sheen's Narrative, p. 77.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE troops were, however, afterwards, <HI>severely repri∣manded</HI> for it. I had almost forgot to mention, that some of the women, rather than be torn from their relations, threw
<PB N="122" REF="143"/>themselves into large tanks, where they were drowned.</Q> The pretence for these brutalities was, that the garrison, an <HI>uncivi∣lized</HI> people, had acted in contradiction to the rules of war among <HI>civilized</HI> nations. After the specimen we gave here, I fear the idea of the civilization the <HI>British</HI> had arrived at, will not rise to any great height. <HI>Matthews</HI> suppressed in his dis∣patches all accounts of this or similar transactions, and also of the vast treasures. We are beholden to private letters for the history. One officer was so shocked at one he had written, that he tore it to pieces! Lieut. <HI>Sheen</HI> was not so delicate! All these shameful relations have been contradicted; yet still, as Sir <HI>Tho∣mas Brown</HI> expresses, they are among those
<Q>verities we fear, and heartily wish there was no truth therein.</Q></P>
<P>THE General,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MANGGALORE TAKEN.</NOTE> now in imaginary security, descended the <HI>Ghaut,</HI> to effect new conquests in the maritime country. He laid siege to <HI>Mangalore.</HI> A practicable breach was soon effected, which the gallant governor, <HI>Rustan Alli beg,</HI> could not persuade hid timid garrison to defend, so he was compelled to surrender. A few years after, he unjustly lost his head, in sight of the city, by order of his cruel master, <HI>Tippoo Sultan.</HI></P>
<P>AT <HI>Mangalore</HI> the General received intelligence, that <HI>Tippoo</HI> was in full march from the <HI>Carnatic</HI> to relieve his coun∣try. After the receipt of the news, his mind grew quite dis∣ordered. He re-ascended the <HI>Ghaut,</HI> and re-entered <HI>Bednore.</HI> In a few days the enemy appeared. His forces were so nume∣rous, that they not only covered the adjacent plains, but even every hill, and more remote than the eye could reach. <HI>Mat∣thews,</HI> in a frenzy, marched out with his handful of men, and
<PB N="123" REF="144"/>met the expected fate; was at once defeated, with the loss of five hundred men. He made his retreat into <HI>Bednore,</HI> which he bravely defended seventeen days: but finding the garrison reduced by sickness, and the number of slain,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BEDNORE RE∣TAKEN.</NOTE> he capitulated on honorable terms. The garrison to be allowed the honors of war: but to pile the arms on the glacis; to retain all private property, and to restore all public, &amp;c. &amp;c. <HI>Tippoo</HI> took possession of the city. Notwithstanding his situation, the avarice of the General overcame every consideration. He ordered the officers to make unlimited drafts on the paymaster, who had before been greatly exhausted by various contrivances. It was currently believed, that he had sent by his brother to <HI>Goa,</HI> three hundred thousand pounds, and a great quantity of diamonds, to be remitted to <HI>Bombay;</HI> and that, even on the point of his departure, he had caused the <HI>bamboos</HI> of his <HI>palanquin</HI> to be pierced, and filled with <HI>pagodas.</HI> When <HI>Tippoo</HI> examined the state of his treasury, he grew enraged at this infamous fraud; he declared the treaty void: put the officers and their <HI>Sepoys,</HI> faithful to them to the last, indiscriminately in irons, and marched them in that condition, in a burning sun, to prisons at <HI>Scringapatam</HI> and other places. Numbers fell dead on the road, the remainder ar∣rived at the place of their destination in the utmost misery, and that increased by the wretched dungeons they were confined in. Those who perished, were nightly flung over the walls, and in <HI>Chitteldroog</HI> the survivors heard the tigers gorging themselves with the corpses of their happier friends
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lieut. Sheen's Narrative, p. 89.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="145"/>THE General was confined at <HI>Seringapatam:</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE GENERAL POISONED.</NOTE> where he was not suffered to linger long. Various are the accounts given of the manner of his end, but the most probable is, that it was by poison.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">ALSO OTHERS.</NOTE> who unfortunately returned from his journey to <HI>Goa,</HI> and a Mr. <HI>Weldon,</HI> were taken into the jungles, and had their throats cut. Numbers of the unhappy men, fated to die by the poisonous draught, abstained from food for many days, till despair and hunger compelled them to take the fatal draught. Others, who by delay made the executioners impatient, had the poison forced down their throats. My pity is suspended for as many as might have been guilty of the barbarity at <HI>Annam∣pour,</HI> was it possible they could have been accessary to the savage fury of their troops, stained in every part of the expedition with slaughter, cruelty, fraud, rapine, and avarice
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Annual Register, 1783, p. 91.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is evident that the severities exercised by <HI>Tippoo,</HI> after this victory, was <HI>here</HI> the determined resolution of inflicting a just punishment; but, unhappily, he included in it the innocent, as well as guilty. After his defeat of Colonel <HI>Braithwaite,</HI> on the banks of the <HI>Coleroon,</HI> how different was his conduct; he con∣sidered <HI>Matthews</HI> as the sordid adventurer, <HI>Braithwaite</HI> as the generous enemy, and treated him and the wounded captives with a humanity that shewed his coolness, and capacity of dis∣tinguishing between the one and the other.</P>
<P>I AM uncertain what the poison was;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">KIND OF POISON.</NOTE> probably a vegetable,

<P>I NOW pursue the event of the complaints laid before the Presidency of <HI>Bombay,</HI> by the seceding officers. Their infor∣mation appeared well founded. <HI>Matthews</HI> was ordered to be superceded, his misfortune being then unknown. <HI>Macleod</HI> was appointed to succeed him in the command, and <HI>Humberston</HI> and <HI>Shaw</HI> to serve under <HI>Macleod.</HI> The sequel is tragical. The new officers, on <HI>April</HI> 5, sailed in the <HI>Ranger</HI> sloop of ten guns, Lieut. <HI>Ornen</HI> commander, to be landed for the purpose of join∣ing the army. On the 7th they fell in with the <HI>Mahratta</HI> fleet, a powerful squadron, which attacked them without the lest notice. Major <HI>Shaw</HI> was shot dead, the General and Col. <HI>Hum∣berston</HI> through the lungs, and several other officers killed or wounded.

He had in his own dominions abundance of materials; and he fixed on <HI>Man∣galore</HI> as his great dock, and military naval port. He has hitherto been unfortunate. In 1768, the place was taken by a sleet sitted out from <HI>Bombay,</HI> and nine great ships and several lesser were brought away
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Annual Register, 1768, p. 67.</NOTE>. <HI>Ayder</HI> soon recovered his port: and, irritated at the disgrace, redoubled his efforts to restore his navy, and carry his great design into execution. By the year 1781 he had almost finished six ships of the line, and several frigates and sloops. He had heard something of the solidity and strength of the waters of the <HI>European</HI> seas, so under the notion of combatting with oceans of ice, he strengthened his ships with planks of great thickness
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">War in Asia, p. 506.</NOTE>. But we did not permit

General <HI>Matthews,</HI> secure as he thought himself in possession of <HI>Bednore,</HI> descended on this city, and in a little time made himself master of the place, with three large ships on the stocks, and several lesser, which totally put to flight the naval vision of the great <HI>Ayder.</HI></P>
<P>IN 1783 <HI>Mangalore</HI> was invested by <HI>Tippoo Sultan</HI> in person, with an army of a hundred and forty thousand fighting men, assisted by the <HI>French.</HI> The governor, Colonel <HI>Campbel,</HI> made a most gallant defence, and suffered every extreme of famine, till the place was given up, on honorable terms, at the conclusion of the war, when it was found a mere heap of rubbish. It had been assailed in the strangest manner, bombarded by great masses of stones, flung out of mortars, which did infinite mis∣chief: the poor soldier who was struck on the body, had a sud∣den relief; those who received them on the extremities suffered a long and agonizing termination of life. <HI>Mangalore</HI> remains in possession of the <HI>Sultan,</HI> with the whole province of <HI>Can∣hara,</HI> the only maritime part allotted to him in the glorious partition treaty.</P>
<P><HI>Nelisuram</HI> is seated a few miles up a river,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NELISURAM.</NOTE> and is supposed to be the <HI>Nelcynda</HI> and <HI>Melcynda</HI> of the antients.</P>
<P>NEAR this river begins that vast extent of coast,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MALABAR COAST.</NOTE> called the <HI>Malabar, Le Royaume de Melibar</HI> of <HI>Marco Polo,</HI> p. 148, com∣prehending the several places, districts or principalities I shall mention.

<P>MOUNT <HI>Dilla,</HI> or <HI>Deli,</HI> is the next place of note,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MOUNT DILLA.</NOTE> it is a small promontory in Lat. 12° 1′, and within is a bay, on which pro∣bably
<PB N="130" REF="151"/>stood the <HI>Elancon emporium</HI> of <HI>Ptolomy. Marco Polo,</HI> the celebrated traveller of the thirteenth century, visited the place in his journey through part of <HI>India.</HI> He calls this tract <HI>Le Royaume d'Eli,</HI> and <HI>Albulseda, Ras Heili,</HI> or the Cape of <HI>Heili. Polo</HI> says, it abounded with pepper, ginger, and other spices. He adds, that if a ship happened to be driven into their port by a tempest, the king immediately confiscated it, saying—<Q>You never intended to come here, but God and fortune disposed it otherwise; so we will profit of what they have been pleased to send.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Cananore</HI> stand a little to the south of Mount <HI>Dilla.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CANANORE.</NOTE> In 1501 it was visited by <HI>Cabral,</HI> on an invitation from the monarch of the place, who treated him in the kindest and most affectionate manner. The <HI>Portuguese</HI> obtained leave to erect a fort near the city, which was their first and usual step towards the enslav∣ing the natives. The friendly monarch died. The new king, provoked by the barbarity of one <HI>Goes,</HI> who had taken an <HI>Ara∣bian</HI> ship, sewed up the whole crew in the sails, and flung them into the sea. Exasperated at this cruelty, the ruling prince laid siege to the fort. The garrison were reduced to the last extremity by famine, when they were relieved, by the sea flinging on shore great quantities of shrimps
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Osorio, i. p. 268.</NOTE>. <HI>Tristan de Cunha</HI> arrived with his fleet, and relieved the garrison. The city afterwards was taken by the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> who continued masters of it till it was besieged, in 1660, by the <HI>Dutch.</HI></P>

He reached that fort on <HI>May</HI> 16. It was deserted by the garrison, after blowing up some of the bastions; and only eighteen miles in∣tervened between him and the grand army, commanded by Lord <HI>Cornwallis,</HI> ready to invest <HI>Seringapatam,</HI> the residence of <HI>Tippoo.</HI> The <HI>Sultan</HI> exerted every resource of a great mind to avert his fate. He fought a pitched battle with the <HI>British</HI> General, and suffered a complete defeat. The Lord of Hosts interfered, and deferred his destruction. The time of the <HI>Monsoons</HI> came on. The victor was obliged to destroy part of his train, and fall back to <HI>Bangalore.</HI> The swell of the <HI>Cavery</HI> forced <HI>Abercromby</HI> to retire

Part of General <HI>Abercromby</HI>'s train also fell a sacrifice to the neces∣sity of the times: and his army, who thought they had sur∣mounted all their difficulties, had the mortisication to find their exertions of no utility, and had to return, worn down by sickness and fatigue, exposed to the incessant rains which then deluged the western coast of the penmsula

<P>THE tract which now bears the name of <HI>Canhara,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ANTIENT COM∣MERCE.</NOTE> is by <HI>Arrian</HI> styled <HI>Cottonara.</HI> The <HI>trans-ghautian</HI> part is the <HI>Pan∣dionis Regio,</HI> which answers to the modern kingdom of <HI>Mysore.</HI></P>
<P>ALL this tract was, in <HI>Arrian</HI>'s time, noted for its rich pro∣ductions and great commerce, particularly in the article pepper. The <HI>Piper cottonaricum</HI> was famous in all parts, but the histo∣rian limits the growth to one spot. The country was far from being confined to that single article: It supplied the merchants with numbers of the finest pearls,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">OTHONIA.</NOTE> ivory, and <HI>Othonia serica,</HI> a certain mixed manufacture of cotton and silk.</P>
<P><HI>Arrian,</HI> i. 539, speaks of the beautiful white linens of <HI>India,</HI> probably the same with the modern calicoes. These formed, as they do at present, a great part of their clothing. This trade is probably continued, to the present day, to the <HI>emporia</HI> of <HI>Tartary.</HI> When <HI>Anthonie Jenkinson</HI> was at <HI>Bochara,</HI> in 1558, the <HI>Indian</HI> caravans brought great quantities of this species of linen, which was much used by the <HI>Tartars</HI> to form their head∣dress,
<PB N="133" REF="154"/>insomuch that they rejected our kersies and cloths, which <HI>Jenkinson</HI> offered to sale
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Purchas, iii. p. 240.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Nardos Gapanica,</HI> or <HI>Nardus,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NARDUS.</NOTE> from a certain part of <HI>India</HI> called <HI>Gapana,</HI> is another article of commerce. The <HI>Nardus</HI> was in high repute in former times, but now is out of fashion. It was much used in form of a pomatum, with which the <HI>Ro∣mans</HI> perfumed their hair. <HI>Horace</HI> speaks of it frequently, on festive occcasions, and in one exemplifies the antient custom of bringing their pretious ointments in a box of <HI>Onyx</HI> or <HI>Alabastrites:</HI>
<Q>Nardi parvus <HI>Onyx</HI> eliciet cadum.</Q> Old <HI>Gerard,</HI> p. 1081, speaks of its medical virtues in his days. I cannot ascertain the plant.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Malebathrum</HI> was another valuable drug from this re∣gion. <HI>Pliny,</HI> lib. xii. c. 12, and lib. xiii. c. 1,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MALEBATHRUM.</NOTE> speaks highly of it as a perfume, in which it seems to have been an ingredient among many others. The <HI>Unguentum Regale</HI> was composed of not fewer than twenty-six. That of <HI>Syria</HI> was also in high request. <HI>Horace</HI> speaks of his sitting with his old friend, <HI>Pom∣peius Varus,</HI> at a feast, crowned with wreaths of flowers, and highly perfumed:
<Q><L>Saepe diem mero</L>
<L>Fregi, coronatus nitentes</L>
<L><HI>Malebathro Syrio</HI> capillos.</L></Q>
<HI>Pliny</HI> gives a very long list of the persumes used by the <HI>Romans.</HI> They were mostly pomatums, and consequently not the most
<PB N="134" REF="155"/>delicate. The variety was endless, and some of the ingredients would seem now very singular. They anointed themselves with some kinds, to suppress the rank smell of their bodies, and often to prevent the effects of their intemperance and excess in meats and drinks, being too sensibly perceived. <HI>Dioscorides</HI> and <HI>Pliny</HI> say, that the vegetable which yielded this perfume was a certain water-plant, that floated on the surface, like what we call duck∣meat. <HI>Gerard,</HI> p. 1534, called it <HI>Talapatra,</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> leaf, and gives the figure of a shrub, related to the clove.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Hyacinthus,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">HYACINTH.</NOTE> a pretious stone, mentioned by <HI>Arrian</HI> as an article of commerce. That of the artients approached the <HI>Amethyst</HI> in value and color.

<P>THE <HI>Testudo Chrysonetiotice</HI> was a small species of land-tor∣toise,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TESTUDO.</NOTE> another export: it was so called by the <HI>Greeks,</HI> being marked as if with threads of gold; this is a faithful descrip∣tion given by the antients: <HI>Linnaus</HI> calls it <HI>Testudo Geometrica; La Cepede</HI> gives a good sigure of it in tab. ix.</P>
<P>THE imports here (for it is well to know the antient wants of the country) were,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">IMPORTS.</NOTE> a considerable quantity of specie; hence we may account for sinding in <HI>India</HI> the coins of <HI>Europe; chry∣solites,</HI> an <HI>Aethiopian</HI> gem of a golden color; a few plain cloths; <HI>Polymcta,</HI> or embroideries of different colors; <HI>Stimmi;</HI> Coral, probably the red, from the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> sea, all others abounding in the eastern seas; rude glass, brass, tin, lead, a little wine, <HI>Sanaarac,</HI> or red arsenic, <HI>Arsenicum,</HI> or the common, wheat for the use of the ships only, being scarcely an article of commerce.</P>

Of the body of the tree the <HI>Indians</HI> make boats, the frames for their houses, and rafters. They thatch their houses with the leaves; and, by slitting them lengthways, make mats and baskets. The utility of the nut of this tree is great, for food, and for drink, and for the oil extracted from it; of the thready rind is made cordage, called <HI>Kaiar,</HI> and I think it is woven into coarse linen.

It is the compliment of the country to offer this at visits, or wheresoever people meet: it is an emblem of peace and friendship, is supposed to ex∣hilarate the spirits, to strengthen the stomachs (but at the expence of the teeth), and is particularly in repute with ladies of intrigue, as it is supposed to improve the powers of love. The <HI>Arabs</HI> call the <HI>Areca</HI> tree <HI>Faufel. Gorard,</HI> p. 1520, has caused it to be engraven.</P>
<P>THESE trees are not found in <HI>Coromandel</HI> or <HI>Bengal.</HI> The nuts are sent there in great quantities, as articles of commerce.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="161"/>THE use of this nut is, in many parts of <HI>India,</HI> greatly abused; they are made the instruments of philtres, charms, and incantations by the fair sex, and often the medium of a fatal poison. The first is intended to conciliate the affection of their lovers, a practice in all ages and in all countries. They are even said to possess the powers of changing affections, to dissolve that between man and wife, and transfer them to other objects. They are next used as means of revenge, for the <HI>spretae injuria formae.</HI> They are said to be capable of preparing the nuts in such a manner, as to bring on the offending parties the completest imbecility; or, if they prefer another mode of revenge, death itself, lingering, and distant; even to any time these demoniac fair chuse. The lover falls into an atrophy, and wastes away in the classical manner, described by the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> when the waxen image was made the fatal incanta∣tion. <HI>Rumphius</HI> records the <HI>Indian</HI> tales, and seems to believe them.

<P>IT is endless to enumerate the plants or trees of <HI>India;</HI> the knowledge of its vegetable kingdom can only be learned from the number of books expressly written on the subject; yet, in the course of this topography, I shall incidentally give a brief account of the most singular, or the most useful. In this place I shall de∣tain the reader a little longer than usual, to mention the useful <HI>Bamboo,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BAMBOO REED.</NOTE> a reed which is found frequent in the country. It is the retreat of tigers, panthers, bears, and other beasts of prey; and the haunt of infinite numbers and varieties of the monkey tribe. Botanists style it <HI>Arundo Bambos,</HI> and <HI>Arundo arbor;</HI> it is an evergreen. The stem is of a vivid green, but as it grows older, becomes of a duller color. I refer to the <HI>Syslema Planta∣rum</HI> for the synonyms. <HI>Rumphius,</HI> iv. 8, describes, but does not give its figure. In the <HI>Hortus Malaharicus,</HI> i. tab. 16, it is found under the title of <HI>Ily. Bamboo</HI> is not the <HI>Indian</HI> name, but one imposed on it by the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> from the violent ex∣plosion the hollows give on being set on fire, occasioned by the confined air, little inferior to that of a piece of artillery. This plant grows to a prodigious height, so as to over-top all trees of
<PB N="143" REF="164"/>the forest; and its circumference so great, as to occasion hyper∣bolical exaggeration. <HI>Pliny</HI> says, that the joints of those which grew about the <HI>Acesines,</HI> are so large, that a single one is suf∣ficent to make a boat.
<Q>Navigiorum etiam vicem praestant (si credimus) singula internodia.</Q> <HI>Pliny</HI> seems to credit the re∣lation; and <HI>Acosta,</HI> (Aromatum liber) an author of credit, in∣forms us, that he had frequently seen them in use on the river, near <HI>Cranganor,</HI> on this coast, and that they were capable of carrying two <HI>Indians;</HI> one sate on each end, with their knees joined, and each carried a short oar, or paddle, with which they rowed with vast rapidity, and even against the stream. The honorable <HI>Edward Monkton,</HI> who had been at <HI>Goa,</HI> has assured me, that the above must have been a mistake. The largest joint he ever saw (which always grows at the bottom of the plant) was not two feet in length, and about the thickness of a stout man's leg.</P>
<P>THE <HI>bamboo</HI> is subservient to other uses similar, but far more important. The reed, formed into a frame, and covered with skin, becomes a boat of the same sort with the <HI>British</HI> coracles, or rather the <HI>vitilia navigia,</HI> in which the <HI>Britons</HI> even crossed our narrow seas
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tour in Wales, i. 234.</NOTE>. <HI>Ayder Alli</HI> had great numbers, which he car∣ried with him in his campaigns: those frames were carried by two men, and the skins by two more; and in a quarter of an hour they were ready for use; one of these vessels was capable of containing twenty-five men, or a piece of cannon, with which they crossed any rivers they found in their march
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hist. of Ayder Alli, i. 116.</NOTE>. As to the horses, they swim by the side of the coracle, held by the horseman (who is in the boat) by the bridle, in the same
<PB N="144" REF="165"/>manner as the <HI>Scots</HI> pass their nags over the narrow arms of the sea
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voy. Hebrides, last edit. p. 326.—Lucan, lib. iv. 131.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is pretended, that these canes are so disliked by the cro∣codiles, that they never seize on the navigators, as the sharks in <HI>Greenland</HI> do on the poor <HI>Greenlanders,</HI> whom they bite in two, secured as they seem to be, in their canoes.</P>
<P>IN most places, the joints are used as pitchers to carry water, and some will contain sufficient to supply the family for the whole day. From this use it is named the <HI>Arundarbor Vasaria.</HI></P>
<P>AT the siege of <HI>Mangalore, Tippoo Sultan</HI> mounted his spears on light <HI>bamboos,</HI> a hundred and forty-seven feet long, and made his desperadoes mount the breaches, and under the fire of his artillery assail the brave garrison, inflicting distant and unexpected wounds or death
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Wars in Asia, i. 497.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN <HI>China,</HI> the joints perforated serve as pipes for conveyance of water, and in the same country, by macerating them, the <HI>Chinese</HI> make their paper, both coarse and fine; split into slen∣der lengths, this cane is of much use in making mats. In short, its uses are innumerable.</P>
<P>THEY are often made use of for frames of houses, for which their ready sissibility, and their lightness, peculiarly adapt them.</P>
<P>THEY are greatly searched after, as poles to carry burthens, but particularly for the poles of <HI>Palanquins;</HI> for this purpose they are bent while growing, to give them a proper curvature; and when richly carved, as they often are, are sold at a vast
<PB N="145" REF="166"/>price in the luxurious <HI>Coromandel,</HI> and other parts.<HI>Linscofan,</HI> and M. <HI>Sonnerat,</HI> give prints of the effeminate great men of <HI>India,</HI> attended by their slavish train, and making their fellow∣creatures their beasts of burden, who go at the rate of two leagues an hour: I observe some of their attendants in the fashion of the high toed shoes, prohibibited in <HI>England</HI> in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> IV <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Holinshed's Chron. p. 668.</NOTE>. Some I observe attended with a dwarf or two, a custom formerly very frequent, even in the <HI>European</HI>courts.</P>
<P>THIS reed is also called <HI>Mambu,</HI> and was celebrated in early times by the <HI>Arabian</HI> physicians, for producing from its joints a sort of inspissated juice, of a sweet taste, called <HI>Tabaxar,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">TABAXAR.</NOTE> and <HI>Sacar Mambu.</HI> It often grows dry, and is discovered by its rattling within the hollow of the reed <NOTE PLACE="marg">† Acosta, in Elus. Exot. 164, 246.</NOTE>. It was a famed medi∣cine with all the <HI>Orientalists,</HI> in outward and inward heats, bilious fevers, and other disorders of that nature, and in dysen∣teries; and it was reckoned peculiarly efficacious in discharges of coagulated blood, so frequently left in internal wounds. These uses made it once a great article of export from the <HI>Malabar</HI> ports. The <HI>Brahmins</HI> also use this <HI>Sacar</HI> in their medical prescriptions.</P>
<P>IN this hot country, the reed is often applied to another use, adapted to refresh the exhausted native; it is bent so as to form arbours and cool walks of considerable length, delicious retreats from the rays of the vertical sun. Finally, the application of it as an instrument of punishment (in <HI>China</HI> at lest), of the most
<PB N="146" REF="167"/>severe nature. It is used as the bastinado, and often till death ensues, in the most cruel manner.</P>
<P>SUGAR was originally brought from <HI>India,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">SUGAR.</NOTE> by the intro∣duction of the plant, the <HI>Saccharum Officinarum.</HI> I shall here give some account of this useful article, and its various removals from its native place into <HI>Europe,</HI> where it was for some ages cultivated with great success. "<HI>Arabia,</HI>" says <HI>Pliny,</HI> lib. xii. c. 8, "produces <HI>Sacearon,</HI> but the best is in <HI>India.</HI>" It is a honey <Q>collected from reeds, a sort of white gum, brittle between the teeth: the largest pieces do not exceed the size of a hazel nut, and it is used only in medicine.</Q></P>
<P>THE cane was an article of commerce in very early times. <NOTE PLACE="marg">ANTIQUITY OF.</NOTE>The prophets <HI>Isaiah</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ch. xlv. 24.</NOTE>and <HI>Jeremiah</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ch. vi. 20.</NOTE> make mention of it: "Thou hast brought me no sweet cane, with money," says the first: and the second, <Q>To what purpose cometh there to me the sweet cane from a far country?</Q> Brought for the luxury of the juice, either extracted by suction or by some other means. In the note on the elegant poem, the <HI>Sugar</HI> Cane <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Note in Book ix. 22.</NOTE>, Doctor <HI>Grainger</HI> informs us, that at first the raw juice was made use of; they afterwards boiled it into a syrup, and, in process of time, an inebriating spirit was prepared therefrom, by fermentation.</P>
<P>SUGAR was first made from the reed in <HI>Egypt,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">ITS REMOVALS.</NOTE> from thence the plant was carried into <HI>Sicily,</HI> which, in the twelfth century, supplied many parts of <HI>Europe</HI> with that commodity; and from thence, at a period unknown, it was probably brought into <HI>Spain,</HI> by the <HI>Moors.</HI> From <HI>Spain</HI> the reed was planted in the <HI>Canary</HI>
<PB N="147" REF="168"/>islands, and in the <HI>Madeira,</HI> by the <HI>Portuguese.</HI> This happened about the year 1506. In the same year, <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Ca∣tholic ordered the cane to be carried from the <HI>Canaries</HI> to St. <HI>Domingo.</HI> From those islands the art of making sugar was introduced into the islands of <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> and in about the year 1623 into the <HI>Brazils;</HI> the reed itself growing spontaneously in both those countries. Till that time sugar was a most expensive luxury, and used only, as Mr. <HI>Anderson</HI> observes, in feasts, and physical necessities.</P>
<P>I SHALL here anticipate the account of the state of sugar in <HI>Spain,</HI> where in <HI>Europe</HI> it first became stationary, <NOTE PLACE="marg">INTO SPAIN.</NOTE> borrowing it from the ninth volume of my Outlines of the Globe. It was, till of late years, cultivated to great advantage in the king∣dom of <HI>Granada,</HI> and great quantities of sugar made in the <HI>ingenios,</HI> or mills. In the year 1723, in the city of <HI>Mesril,</HI> were eight hundred families: Their principal commerce was in sugars and syrups, made in four sugar works, from the planta∣tions of canes, which reached from the south side down to the sea side; but these and the other sugar works are greatly decayed, by reason of the excessive duties. This, with the increased demand for sugar, on the prevaling use of chocolate in the kingdom, which requires double the quantity of that article, has occasioned a drain of a million of dollars out of the country, in payment for sugar, preserves, and other confec∣tionaries. This is very extraordinary, considering that <HI>Spain</HI> is possessed of some of the sinest sugar islands, besides the power of manufacturing it within its home dominions <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Uztariz, ii. ch. 94.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I NOW digress several leagues to the west, <NOTE PLACE="marg">LACCADIVE ISLES.</NOTE> to the <HI>Laccadive</HI> isles, a considerable group, the centre of which is nearly op∣posite
<PB N="148" REF="169"/>to <HI>Tellicherry.</HI> They extend from Lat. 10° to 12° 50′ north, are low, and not to be seen farther than six or seven leagues. These are supposed to be the isles intended by <HI>Ptole∣my,</HI> by the title of <HI>Insulae Numero</HI> XIX. but, in fact, they are thirty-two, all of them small, and covered with trees, and rocky on their sides, mostly as if laid on a bottom of sand, attended with reefs, and the channels between them are very deep. They are commonly navigated by our ships, in their way to the <HI>Persian</HI> Gulph, or the <HI>Red</HI> Sea. That called the ix½ degree channel, or the passage between the most southern of the <HI>Laccadives,</HI> the isle of <HI>Malique,</HI> and that called <HI>Mamala,</HI> or the viii. degree channel, between the isle of <HI>Malique,</HI> and the most northern of the <HI>Maldive</HI> isles, are those which are in use. Each island has its name: Captain <HI>Cornwal</HI> says, that called <HI>Calpenia</HI> has a river, where ships of two hundred tons may float and clean.</P>
<P>THE principal traffic of these isles, is in the products of the coco trees, such as the oil, the cables, and cordage; and in fish, which is dried and sent to the continent of <HI>India,</HI> from whence they get rice, &amp;c. in return. They also trade to <HI>Mascat,</HI> in large boats, and carry there the same commodities, and bring back dry and wet dates, <NOTE PLACE="marg">AMBERGRISE.</NOTE> and a little coffee. Ambergrise is found often, floating off these isles. <HI>Hamilton</HI> mentions a piece in possession of a certain <HI>Rajah,</HI> valued at £.1,250 sterling. It is now generally supposed to be a mineral; <HI>Cronsted,</HI> at lest, ranks it among them: the best is of a grey color, is a strong perfume, and is also much used in medicine. It is highly esteemed as a cordial, and in nervous complaints; and, in extremities, is ad∣ministered often as a persuasive to the soul not to quit its earthly tenement.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="170"/>A Captain <HI>Coffin,</HI> engaged in the southern or <HI>Guinea</HI> whale fishery, found in a female spermaceti whale, three hundred and sixty ounces of ambergrise. This is said not to be unusual, but then it always is in fickly emaciated fishes. These instances do not prove that it was the production of the spermaceti whale, the food of which is <HI>squids,</HI> or the <HI>sepia:</HI> many of the horny beaks were found adhering to the ambergrise, or im∣mersed in that soft substance. It appears to me, that the whales sometimes swallow it, that it disagrees with them, and acts as a sort of poison, bringing on a decay, and death; and that the parts of the <HI>sepia</HI> found lodged in it, are the undissolved remains lodged in the ambergrise. Mr. <HI>Cossin</HI> sold his prize at nineteen shillings and nine pence per ounce. This is related in Phil. Trans. lxxxi. p. 43.</P>
<P>MIDWAY between these isles and those of the <HI>Maldives,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">ISLE OF MALI∣QUE.</NOTE> is the isle of <HI>Malique,</HI> a small, low, and solitary spot, surrounded with breakers, seated in Lat. 8° 20′ north. It is inhabited, and dependent on a <HI>Rajah</HI> on the <HI>Malabar</HI> coast. A large shallop of twenty-two oars came off to a <HI>French India</HI> ship in 1770: among the people were three who appeared of rank, and who very politely offered their services to the <HI>European</HI> officer.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Maldive</HI> islands are to the south of the last. <NOTE PLACE="marg">MALDIVE ISLANDS.</NOTE> They extend from north to south, inclining a little to the south-east, from Lat. 7° 25′ to a little more than Lat. 1°. These are the most singular and numerous groups of isles in the world: From their number <HI>Ptolemy</HI> names them <HI>Insulae</HI> MCCCLXXVIII. The <HI>Nubian</HI> Geographer calls these isles <HI>Robaihat.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="171"/>THE two <HI>Mahometan</HI> travellers of the ninth century, make them amount to nineteen hundred; and the sea which sur∣rounds them, and lies to the north-west of them, they called the <HI>Harchend</HI> sea. The natives make the number of their isles amount to twelve thousand. They were discovered in 1508, by the younger <HI>Almeyda;</HI> and conquered by the <HI>Portuguese</HI> from the <HI>Moors,</HI> who had usurped the sovereignty of them from the natives, who probably came originally from the adjacent <HI>Ma∣labar.</HI> The <HI>Europeans</HI> did not long maintain possession. The <HI>Portuguese</HI> had obtained leave to erect a fort on one of the isles; but they were soon cut off by the <HI>Maldivians,</HI> and their fort demolished.</P>
<P>THEY are divided into thirteen <HI>Attollons,</HI> or provinces, and are governed by one king; but each <HI>Attollon</HI> has its particular governor, who rules with great oppression. The subjects are miserably poor, and none dare wear any cloathing above the waist, except a turband, without a particular license. The king assumes the magnificent title of <HI>Sultan</HI> of the <HI>Maldives,</HI> king of thirteen provinces, and twelve thousand isles. From Mr. <HI>Dalrymple</HI>'s chart of the <HI>Maldives,</HI> they seem divided into thir∣teen groups, each pretty nearly equidistant, and each with their proper name: their form is most singular; they are represented as reefs of small and very low islands, regular in their form, and surrounding a clear space of sea, with a very shallow por∣tion of water between them. The chief is called <HI>Atoll Mal∣divas:</HI> they have only four ports, in which their few articles of commerce are collected.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="172"/>ONE article is the <HI>Cowry,</HI> a small species of shell, <NOTE PLACE="marg">TRADE IN COWRY SHELLS.</NOTE> the <HI>Cyproea Moneta</HI> of <HI>Linnaeus, D'Argenville,</HI> tab. xviii. fig. K. It is very singular that many parts of the world should for ages past be obliged to these little and remote islands for their specie; and that the contemptible shells of the <HI>Maldives,</HI> prove the price of mankind, and contribute to the vilest of traffic in <HI>Negro-land;</HI> but so it is! These shells are collected twice in the month, at full and new moon. It is the business of the women, who wade up to their middle to gather them. They are packed up in parcels of twelve thousand each, and are the cur∣rent money among the poor in <HI>Bengal.</HI> A <HI>Cowry</HI> is rated there at the hundred and sixtieth part of a penny, so that it is impossible to find a coin so small as to be of use to the poor in a country where provisions are so exceedingly cheap; eighty <HI>Cowries</HI> make a <HI>pun,</HI> and from fifty to sixty <HI>puns,</HI> the value of a <HI>roupee,</HI> or four shillings and six-pence <HI>English.</HI> They are re-exported to <HI>England, France,</HI> &amp;c.; and from those places again to <HI>Guinea,</HI> as the price of the unhappy natives. <HI>Ha∣milton,</HI> i. 347, mistakes the manner of gathering them, when he says—<Q>The natives fling into the sea branches of coco trees, to which the shells adhere, and are collected every four or five months.</Q> The exchange for them from <HI>Bengal,</HI> is rice, butter, and cloth, which is brought from that country in small vessels, fitted for the shallow navigations.</P>
<P>THESE islands, as well as the <HI>Laccadives,</HI> have besides a brisk trade with the western coasts of <HI>India,</HI> chiefly in coco nuts, and the several manufactures from that useful article. Among which, the <HI>Kaiar,</HI> or cables and ropes, made of the filaments of the nuts, have a vast sale on all the coast of <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="173"/>FISH is another article; <NOTE PLACE="marg">IN FISH.</NOTE>the species is said to be chiefly the <HI>Bonito,</HI> or <HI>Scomber Pelamys.</HI> These annually migrate among the isles, in <HI>April</HI> and <HI>May.</HI> They are caught both by hook and net, are split, and the bone taken out, sprinkled with sea water and set to dry; then put into the sand, wrapt up in coco leaves, and placed a foot or two below the surface, where they become as hard as stock-fish. Vessels come from <HI>Atcheen</HI> in the isle of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> with gold dust, to purchase this necessary, which is again sold there at the rate of £.8 per thousand.</P>
<P>THE coco tree is the only one which these isles do produce, for they are universally sandy and barren. Of this the inhabi∣tants build vessels of twenty or thirty tons. The cables, ropes, sails, and every individual part is made of this tree; which even supplies the sire-wood, and provision, oil for their kitchens and lamps, sugar, and candied sweetmeats, and strong cloth.</P>
<P>THEY are furnished with water from wells, which they dare not sink deeper than five or six feet, otherwise the salt water will percolate through the sand. On them they depend, nor do these ever fail.</P>
<P><HI>Ali, Rajah</HI> of <HI>Cananore,</HI> and High Admiral of <HI>Ayder Alli,</HI> made a conquest of these isles, took the king captive, and cruelly put out his eyes. In this state, he presented him to <HI>Ayder,</HI> who highly disapproving of the barbarity, deprived the <HI>Rajah</HI> of the command of the fleet, and treated the unhappy prince with the utmost humanity, gave him a palace, and settled on him a re∣venue to supply him with every pleasure he was capable of tasting <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. of Ayder Alli, i. 98.</NOTE>. The poets of <HI>Ayder</HI>'s court added to his title on this
<PB N="153" REF="174"/>occasion, "<HI>King of the islands of the sea;</HI>" and in their poems placed him above <HI>Alexander</HI> and <HI>Tamerlane.</HI> Let me here say, that he had his poet-laureat always resident, who had a stipend of a thousand <HI>roupees</HI> a month, and the rank of a general of a thousand men <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist.

<P>THE city of <HI>Calicut,</HI> seated in Lat. 11° 18′, <NOTE PLACE="marg">CITY OF CA∣LICUT.</NOTE> stands about eight leagues to the south of the <HI>Rock of Sacrifice.</HI> This place is cele∣brated as being the first land in <HI>India</HI> which the <HI>Europeans</HI> ever saw, after the long interval of the <HI>Roman</HI> commerce. Here the great <HI>Gama,</HI> on <HI>May</HI> 18, 1698, first saw the fertile risings and plains of <HI>Malabar,</HI> backed by the lofty <HI>Ghauts,</HI> rise before him. Mr. <HI>Dalrymple,</HI> in one of his plates, gives a view of what it now
<PB N="154" REF="175"/>is, and, in respect to its natural situation, what it must have been at that time. The works of art are too minute to be perceptible, amidst the bold and eternal operations of nature.</P>
<P><HI>Calicut</HI> was at that time the greatest <HI>emporium</HI> of all <HI>India.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">ITS ANTIENT TRADE.</NOTE> The commerce of the <HI>Arabs</HI> with this port was prodigious. Pretious stones, pearls, amber, ivory, <HI>China</HI>-ware, gold and silver, silks and cottons, indigo, sugar, spices, valuable woods, perfumes, beautiful varnishes, and whatever adds to the luxu∣ries of life, were brought there from all parts of the east. Some of these rich commodities came by sea; but as navigation was neither so safe, nor pursued with so much spirit as it hath been since, a great part of them was conveyed by land, on the backs of oxen and elephants.</P>
<P>ALL its splendor and all its opulence was owing to commerce, yet the houses were mean, but not crowded, detached from each other, and surrounded with delicious gardens; none were built of stone, but the royal palace, which rose with great magnifi∣cence above the other buildings. The town was very exten∣sive, and very populous.</P>
<P>AT the arrival of the <HI>Portuguese</HI> it was governed by a mo∣narch, <NOTE PLACE="marg">THE ZAMO∣REEN.</NOTE> called the <HI>Zamorin,</HI> who, like a lord paramount, had all the other princes of <HI>Malabar</HI> as tributaries. The account, as related by the <HI>Portuguese</HI> historians, is, that six hundred years before the arrival of <HI>Gama,</HI> or about the year 898, <HI>Perimal</HI> reigned supreme over the whole country. In his old age he became a convert to <HI>Mahometism,</HI> and determined to resign his dominions to his relations, and finish his days at the holy city of <HI>Medina.</HI> His successors retained the antient religion, and are considered as chief of the <HI>Nayrs.</HI> I will relate the tale in the

<P><HI>Gama</HI> was at first well received at <HI>Calicut,</HI> but the jealousy of the <HI>Arabs,</HI> prevented his friendship with the <HI>Zamorin</HI> from being of any duration. The <HI>Portuguese</HI> never could make themselves masters of the place; but at length <HI>Albuquerque,</HI> in
<PB N="157" REF="178"/>1503,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SEIZED BY AL∣BUQUERQUE.</NOTE> prevaled on the reigning prince to permit him to build a fort not far from the city. This gave him the command of the commerce, notwithstanding the city remained under the line of its antient rulers, who very frequently were engaged in wars with their <HI>European</HI> neighbors. The <HI>English</HI> had their factories here, but, I believe, have long since deserted the place. As to the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> they became so distressed, by the union of the <HI>Dutch</HI> with the <HI>Zamorin,</HI> that they blew up their fortress, and entirely quitted the neighborhood. It was afterwards either undermined with the sea, or overthrown by an earthquake, for <HI>Hamilton</HI> says, that in 1703 his ship, which drew twenty-one feet water, struck on its ruins.</P>
<P><HI>Ayder Alli</HI> advanced towards this town.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BY AYDER ALLI.</NOTE> It was voluntarily surrendered to him by the <HI>Zamorin,</HI> who prostrated himself at his feet, and presented him with two basons of gold, one filled with pieces of gold, the other with pretious stones; and two small cannons of gold, with golden carriages of the same metal. <HI>Ayder</HI> raised him from the ground, and promised to restore to him his dominions, on condition of paying a small tribute. The two princes parted, seemingly in perfect amity. The next day the palace appeared on fire. In desiance of all attempts to save it, it was wholly destroyed, and with it perished the prince, his family, and vast treasures. The <HI>Zamorin</HI> had just received let∣ters from the <HI>Hindoo Rajahs</HI> of <HI>Travancore</HI> and <HI>Cochin,</HI> bit∣terly reproaching him with betraying his country to the <HI>Maho∣metans,</HI> and becoming apostate to his religion, declaring him degraded and expelled from his cast. So affected was he with the

His forces consisted of three thousand foot and near a thousand horse.
"I am ashamed," says the modest victor,

<P><HI>Paniani</HI> is a town a few miles farther, where the <HI>English</HI> had once a settlement.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PANIANI.</NOTE> What makes it particularly remarkable is, that the <HI>Ghauts,</HI> opposite to the place, have in them a gap, be∣tween fourteen and fifteen miles in length, and about sixteen miles in width, occupied chiefly by forest trees, and is defended by the forts of <HI>Annamally</HI> and <HI>Palicaudcherry,</HI> and others: It being the important pass to and from the <HI>Malabar</HI> coast, and of late years has been very frequently the seat of action.

<P>THE river <HI>Paniani</HI> rises from the north-east in the <HI>Coimbotore</HI> country,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">COIMBOTORE COUNTRY.</NOTE> and passes through the breach, and in the rainy season is navigable for small boats, to the foot of the <HI>Ghauts.</HI> Its source is from an elevated plain, sixty miles in extent, rising suddenly out of the surrounding country like a vast terrace, and faces the great gap: Such are common in <HI>India,</HI> and are features almost peculiar to the country.</P>
<P>TWENTY-five miles south of <HI>Paniani</HI> is <HI>Cranganore,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CRANGANORE.</NOTE> the northern frontier of the <HI>Rajahship</HI> of <HI>Travencore.</HI> When <HI>Gama</HI> arrived on this coast he was surprised with a visit of certain deputies from that city, informing him, that they were, like him, <HI>Christians,</HI> and requesting to be taken under the protection of his great master, <HI>Emmanuel. Gama</HI> received them with the utmost affection, and assured them, he should recommend their interests to the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Admirals
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Osorio, lib. i. p. 134.</NOTE>, whom he should leave on the coast. After his departure, a quarrel happened between them and the <HI>Zamorin.</HI> A ship loaden with spices was on its way from <HI>Calicut</HI> to <HI>Cranganore;</HI> such was the avarice of the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> that they could not resist making it a prize. The nephew of the <HI>Zamorin,</HI> who was their warm
<PB N="161" REF="183"/>friend, represented to them the danger of offending his un∣cle; and at the same time assured them, that the cargo was de∣signed to be disposed of to them. All was in vain; they took the ship, and slew some of the crew. The nephew demanded satisfaction, but his remonstrances were received with con∣tempt.</P>
<P><HI>Lopez Soarez,</HI> a <HI>Portuguese</HI> admiral, came into <HI>India</HI> about this time with thirteen ships. He found that the <HI>Zamorin,</HI> and the citizens of <HI>Cranganore,</HI> were preparing to revenge the injuries done them. He sailed for that port, landed his men, and, assisted by the King of <HI>Cochin,</HI> attacked the <HI>Indian</HI> army, gained a complete victory, and pursued the fugitives into the city, and set it on fire.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BURNT.</NOTE> It was to no purpose that the <HI>Christian</HI> inhabitants entreated the conquerors to spare their churches. They did indeed attempt to quench the flames, but to no pur∣pose, for very few of the places of worship escaped. This hap∣pened in 1504. The <HI>Portuguese</HI> built a strong fort near the spot, about a league up the river, or channel, which is not above a quarter of a mile broad, but very deep, yet on the bar, at spring-tides, had not above fourteen feet of water. A new city arose, but the <HI>Indians</HI> rebuilt it at some distance from the antient site, and it became one of the sinest in <HI>India.</HI> A chan∣nel divides it from another narrow isle, which is about four leagues long, and runs north and south, parallel with the main land. Another channel divides it from that of <HI>Cochin.</HI> The <HI>Dutch,</HI> under Commodore <HI>Goens,</HI> made themselves masters of <HI>Cranganore</HI> in 1660, without meeting the lest resistance. The <HI>Portuguese,</HI> enervated with luxury, and detested for their cru∣elty,
<PB N="162" REF="184"/>in a single year lost every one of their possessions in <HI>Mala∣bar</HI> to their antient foes, who succeeded to their wealth and power, supported by wisdom, oeconomy, and valor. As soon as they were masters of the place, they prohibited all boats or vessels from entering at the two channels, determined to pre∣vent surprise, and illicit trade.</P>
<P>THIS city was distinguished by two most remarkable circum∣stances:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">JEWS IN INDIA.</NOTE> the one (to begin with the most antient) was its having been the residence of a republic of <HI>Jews,</HI> part of the tribe of <HI>Manassch,</HI> who had been carried into captivity by <HI>Nebuchadnez∣zar,</HI> who sent numbers of them to this distant place. Their history says, that they amounted to twenty thousand, and that they were three years in travelling to this place, from the time of their setting out from <HI>Babylon.</HI> When they arrived they were treated with great humanity by the natives, and allowed every indulgence in both religious and temporal concerns. In process of time, they grew so wealthy as to purchase the little kingdom of <HI>Cranganore. Hamilton,</HI> i, p. p. 321, 322, makes them increase to eighty thousand families, but in his days they were reduced to four thousand. They established a common∣wealth, and selected the two sons of one of the first families, emi∣nent for their wisdom, to govern them jointly. One of them, in∣stigated by ambition, murdered his brother: after which the commonwealth became a democracy; and their territory, many centuries ago, returned into the hands of the natives. Power∣ful as they were, they are at present very poor, and few. Num∣bers of them had removed to <HI>God,</HI> where they were greatly encouraged by the <HI>Zamorin</HI> of the time. They have to this
<PB N="163" REF="185"/>day a synagogue, near the king's palace, at a small distance from <HI>Cochin,</HI> where are preserved their records, engraven on copper plates, in <HI>Hebrew</HI> characters, and when any of the characters decay, they are new cut, so that they can shew their history from the reign of <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> to the present time. The <HI>Maecenas</HI> of <HI>Malabar,</HI> M. <HI>von Rheede,</HI> caused these records to be translated into low <HI>Dutch:</HI> The perusal would be very desirable. I trust that these plates were not forgeries to im∣pose on the curious governor, as the famous inscription on the death of the <HI>Danish</HI> monarch, <HI>Hardicanute,</HI> at <HI>Lambeth,</HI> was by a witty wag, which so capitally deceived the first antiquaries of our days
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See European Magazine, Vol. xvii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THAT St. <HI>Thomas</HI> preached the Gospel in <HI>India,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHRISTIANS IN INDIA.</NOTE> I make no doubt. He first visited the isle of <HI>Socotora;</HI> after performing the orders of his Divine Master, he passed through the several kingdoms which intervened between that isle and <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> From <HI>Socotora</HI> he landed at <HI>Cranganore,</HI> where he continued some time, and made numbers of proselytes, and, in all proba∣bility, established a church government. From thence he vi∣sited the eastern parts of <HI>India,</HI> and met with martyrdom at <HI>Meliapour;</HI> where we shall resume the history of this great Apostle.</P>
<P>THOSE <HI>Christians</HI> on the <HI>Malabar</HI> coast grew into a potent people; but, if we may credit <HI>Marco Polo,</HI> p. 135, there was in the centre of <HI>India</HI> a country called <HI>Abasia,</HI> divided into seven kingdoms, three of which were <HI>Mahometan,</HI> the other four
<PB N="164" REF="186"/><HI>Christian.</HI> The <HI>Christians</HI> distinguished themselves by a golden cross worn over their forcheads; but the <HI>Jews</HI> who were among them were marked on their checks with a hot iron.</P>
<P>BUT what weighs greatly with me concerning the truth of the existence of the <HI>Indian Christians,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">OR CHRISTIANS OF ST. THEMAS,</NOTE> or <HI>Christians</HI> of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> as they are usually called, is, that the knowlege of them had reached <HI>England</HI> as early as the ixth century;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">KNOWN IN ENG∣LAND IN 883.</NOTE> for we are cer∣tain that our great <HI>Alsred,</HI> in consequence of a vow, sent <HI>Sig∣h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m</HI> II. in the year 883, Bishop of <HI>Sherbourn,</HI> first to <HI>Rome,</HI> and afterwards to <HI>India,</HI> with alms to the <HI>Christians</HI> of the town of <HI>Saint Thomas,</HI> now <HI>Mcliapour,</HI> who returned with various rich gems, some of which were to be seen in the church of <HI>Sherbourn</HI> (according to <HI>William of Malmsbury,</HI> lib. ii. 248) even in his days. I have not extent of faith to favour the legend of the place of the martyrdom of the saint, which was fixed by pious historians to have been at St. <HI>Thomas</HI> on the <HI>Coromandel</HI> coast; of which the reader will find an account in the following vo∣lume.</P>
<P>THE rites and customs of these <HI>Christians</HI> differ in several respects from those of the church of <HI>Rome.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">THEIR RITES.</NOTE> In some they ac∣cord, which makes me imagine there might have been some accidented communication of the nature of that I have men∣tioned above. <HI>Osorio,</HI> i. 212, gives an account of their ceremo∣nies. Speaking of the <HI>Christians</HI> of <HI>Cranganore,</HI> he thus goes on—<Q>The <HI>Christians</HI> who reside here, are generally very poor, and their churches of a mean appearance. They keep the sabbath in the same manner as we do, in hearing sermons, and performing other religious duties. The high priest, whom
<PB N="165" REF="187"/>they acknowleged as the head of their church, had his seat near some mountains, towards the north, in a country called <HI>Chaldaeis.</HI> He has a council composed of twelve cardinals, two bishops, and several priests: With the assistance of these, he settles all affairs relating to religion; and all the <HI>Christians</HI> in these parts acquiesce in his decrees. The priests are shaved in such a manner, as to represent a cross on their crowns. They administer the sacrament in both kinds, making use of the juice of pressed grapes, by way of wine, and allow the laity to partake of both; but no one is admitted to this solemn ordinance till he has made a confession of his iniquities. They baptized not their infants till they were forty days old, except in danger of death. When any one amongst them is seized with a fit of sickness, the priest immediately visits him, and the sick person is greatly animated by the holy man's supplications. When they enter their churches, they sprin∣kle themselves with holy water. They use the same form of burial as in other catholic countries: the relations of the de∣ceased give great entertainments, which last a week, during which time they celebrate his praises, and put up prayers for his eternal happiness. They preserve the sacred writings in the <HI>Syrian</HI> or <HI>Chaldaean</HI> language, with great carefulness; and their teachers are ready in all public places to instruct every one. They keep the <HI>Advent Sunday,</HI> and the forty days of <HI>Lent,</HI> with great strictness, and observe most of the festivals which we have in our church, with the same exactness. They compute their time likewise in the same manner as we do, adding a day to every fourth year. The
<PB N="166" REF="188"/>first day of <HI>July</HI> is kept as a holiday, in honor of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> not only by these <HI>Christians,</HI> but many of the <HI>Pagans</HI> also. There are likewise convents for the priests, and nunneries for their women, who adhere to their vows of chastity with the utmost probity. Their priests are allowed to marry once, but excluded from taking a second wife. Marriages amongst other people cannot be annulled, but by the death of one of the parties. When a woman becomes a widow, she forfeits her dowry if married within a twelve-month after the death of her husband. These are the customs and manners which the <HI>Christians</HI> in <HI>Cranganore,</HI> as well as many other parts of <HI>India,</HI> have observed with the utmost fidelity, from the time of St. <HI>Thomas.</HI></Q></P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Gama</HI> arrived on this coast, there were about two hun∣dred thousand of them in the southern parts of <HI>Malabar;</HI> during thirteen hundred years they had been under the Patriarch of <HI>Babylon,</HI> who appointed their <HI>Metarene</HI> or Archbishop. They were extremely averse to the doctrine of St. <HI>Francis de Xavier,</HI> when he came among them, and abhorred the worship of im∣ages, which they considered as idolatry. They refused to ac∣knowlege the Pope's supremacy, and at length were per∣secuted as heretics, with all the horrors of the inquisition, newly established at <HI>Goa. Xavier</HI> had never troubled his new converts with any instruction, nor ever instilled into them any knowlege of the principles of the <HI>Christian</HI> religion, any farther than implicit obedience to the head of the church. He gave them crucifixes to worship, and told them, they were then sure of heaven. His preaching was subservient to the political in∣terests
<PB N="167" REF="189"/>of his country; his abilities, and his labors for that end were amazing. In him appeared all the powers which, in after times, gave to his order that vast importance in the affairs of the universe. I will conclude this article with saying, that out of the fifty thousand inhabitants found in <HI>Bednore</HI> when <HI>Ayder Alli</HI> took possession of it, thirty thousand were <HI>Christians,</HI> "who," says his historian, i. p. 83,
<Q>were endowed with great privileges.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Cranganore,</HI> and a fort on the opposite side of the river, named <HI>Jacotta,</HI> gave rise to the important war of the <HI>Mysore.</HI> They had been taken from the <HI>Portuguese</HI> by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and possessed by the last a hundred and fifty years. <HI>Ayder Alli,</HI> seeing the conveniency of <HI>Cranganore</HI> to his <HI>Mysorean</HI> kingdom, in 1780, seized and garrisoned it. In the ensuing war, the <HI>Dutch</HI> re∣possessed themselves of it. In 1789 <HI>Tippoo Sultan,</HI> the successor of <HI>Ayder,</HI> determined to make himself master of it, in right of his father. He raised a mighty army, which so alarmed the <HI>Dutch,</HI> that they resolved to dispose of the two forts to the <HI>Rajah</HI> of <HI>Travancore,</HI> an ally of the <HI>English,</HI> in order to divert the storm from themselves. <HI>Tippoo</HI> marched with his forces, and attacked the lines of <HI>Travancore.</HI> The battle between his army and that of the <HI>Rajah,</HI> the latter in defence of <HI>Cranganore,</HI> on <HI>May</HI> 1, 1790, was the signal of the general war, on which commenced the first campaign in <HI>June</HI> following. The con∣clusion of that glorious war was the putting us in possession of the whole coast, from <HI>Caroor</HI> as far as mount <HI>Dilly,</HI> a tract of a hundred and twenty miles. This is the result of the partition treaty.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="190"/><HI>Cochin</HI> lies in Lat.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">COCHIN.</NOTE> 9° 58′ N. on the southern side of the chan∣nel, on an island opposite to another that stretches to the south. It is a <HI>Rajahship,</HI> possibly dependent on that of <HI>Travancore,</HI> who seems to have undertaken the defence of the whole tract south∣ward, by erecting the famous lines of <HI>Travancore,</HI> which begin at <HI>Cranganore</HI> and extend almost to the foot of the <HI>Ghauts.</HI> The coast is very low, scarcely discernible, except by the trees. The soundings are gradual, and are, at the distance of two miles from shore, ten or eleven fathoms. Ships usually lie three or four miles from land; a dangerous bar is an obstruction to en∣tering the harbour; and a most furious surge at times beats on the shore.</P>
<P>THIS was one of the first places visited by the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> after their arrival at <HI>Calicut.</HI> It was at that time governed by a prince, tributary to the <HI>Zamorin,</HI> but who shewed every act of friendship to the Admiral, <HI>Cabral,</HI> and his companions. At his time the harbour was capacious and open. While he was there, two of the <HI>Christians</HI> of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> came and requested him to convey them to <HI>Portugal,</HI> that from thence they might visit <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and the <HI>Holy Land. Gama</HI> himself afterwards visited <HI>Cochin,</HI> and received every mark of respect. The prince continued faithful to his new allies, and assisted them with a considerable army against the <HI>Zamorin.</HI> At length fortune de∣clared against him; the <HI>Zamorin</HI> burnt his capital, and made himself master of his dominions. The <HI>Portuguese</HI> under <HI>Fran∣cis Albuquerque,</HI> says <HI>Lasitau,</HI> came, in 1503, to their assistance, expelled the <HI>Zamorin,</HI> and <HI>Duarte Pachcco,</HI> whom <HI>Albuquer∣que</HI> had left behind, by his astonishing valor and prudence, re∣instated
<PB N="169" REF="191"/><HI>Triumpara,</HI> the reigning prince, but only to fit him for a new mortification. In the transports of his gratitude he per∣mitted the <HI>Portuguese</HI> to build a fort. This gave them full power over their faithful ally; and, under pretence of reducing his rebellious subjects, made a conquest of the whole country. In a little time the poor prince found himself enslaved. <HI>Cochin</HI> became, under its new masters, a place of great commerce, till the year 1660, fatal to the <HI>Portuguese</HI> power in this part of <HI>India.</HI> It was attacked by the Commodore <HI>Goens.</HI> The gar∣rison made a most gallant defence, nor was it taken till after great loss on both sides. The <HI>Dutch</HI> found the city much too large for their purpose; they reduced it considerably. The titular king did not find any improvement in his situation, and it is said, that the present prince lives near <HI>Cochin,</HI> with an in∣come of little more than six hundred pounds a year. Some of the race of the <HI>Jewish</HI> captives, and some of the <HI>Christians</HI> of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> reside here. The last are miserably poor and ignorant; but the church of St. <HI>Andrea,</HI> not far from hence, is served by their clergy.</P>
<P>IN this city breathed his last the great <HI>Vasco de Gama,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">OF VASCO DE GAMA.</NOTE> the discoverer of <HI>India,</HI> and, with the illustrious <HI>Albuquerque,</HI> the founder of the <HI>Portuguese</HI> empire in that inexhaustible region of wealth. <HI>Gama</HI> was born at <HI>Sines,</HI> a port in the province of <HI>Alentejo,</HI> in <HI>Portugal,</HI> of a family rendered illustrious by the valour of the individuals. <HI>Vasco</HI> was only the fifth in heraldic history, which does not even acquaint us with the time of his birth. He had served in <HI>France,</HI> and he was Gentleman of the Bedchamber to the great <HI>Emmanuel,</HI> when he was appointed, in
<PB N="170" REF="192"/>1497, to the important command of the fleet destined for the discovery of the <HI>Indies.</HI> We have successively mentioned his name, on several glorious occasions; our business now is only to trace him to his end: He survived to the reign of <HI>John</HI> III. to be appointed to a third voyage, and to finish his days on that shore, where he had begun his career of glory. He sailed from <HI>Lisbon</HI> on <HI>April</HI> 10, 1524. Prodigies attended his voyage; on his arrival off the coast of <HI>Cambay,</HI> in the stillness of a calm, a dreadful swelling of the sea, the then unknown symptons of an earthquake, appalled the boldest. <HI>Gama</HI> discovered the phoeno∣menon: "Courage!" says he, "<HI>India</HI> trembles at our approach!" Another danger followed this. From the description, his ship was nearly foundered by the fall of a water-spout. He arrived, at length, at this port, where he gave up his great soul, on <HI>De∣cember</HI> 24, 1525, to be judged according to unerring justice; for, amidst all his fine qualities, he was deeply tainted with the character of his nation, cruelty. His body lay deposited at <HI>Cochin</HI> till 1538, when it was brought to <HI>Lisbon,</HI> where it was received with greater honor than was ever before paid to any person, excepting those of the blood royal.</P>
<P>A FATE similar to that of <HI>Gama</HI> attended <HI>Alphonso Albuquer∣que,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">OF ALBUQUERQUE.</NOTE> descended illegitimately from the blood royal of <HI>Portugal.</HI> He was sent out by his prince, for the first time in 1503, and in successive voyages shewed himself to have been superior to any one of his nation, before or after him, both in the military and political line: he was fitted by his talents to be the founder of a great empire. We trace him almost every where from the <HI>Red</HI> Sea to the utmost limits of his <HI>Indian</HI> expedition, as far as <HI>Su∣matra,</HI>
<PB N="171" REF="193"/>and the distant <HI>Malacca:</HI> on his last voyage he was struck by the hand of death. He directed his pilot to steer for <HI>Goa,</HI> the scene of many of his glorious actions. He was in∣formed on the way that he was recalled, and two persons, most disagreeable to him, were to succeed to the government of <HI>India.</HI> "<HI>Lopez Soarez,</HI>" exclamed he,
<Q>Governor of <HI>India!</HI>— it is he! it could be no other! <HI>Don James Mendez,</HI> and <HI>James Pereyra,</HI> whom I sent prisoners for heinous crimes, return, the one governor of <HI>Cochin,</HI> the other secretary!

<P>ALL the tract of country from <HI>Cranganore</HI> almost to <HI>Anjenjo,</HI> a tract of about a hundred and twenty miles, consists of multi∣tudes
<PB N="172" REF="194"/>of very low wooded isles, formed by a thousand rivers, that tumble from the <HI>Ghauts.</HI> This flat country extends thirty miles inland, and has intermixed a great assemblage of lakes, rivers, and forests, the whole marshy, and most unwholesome: it abounds with fish and game, which makes <HI>Cochin,</HI> in that respect, a most luxurious residence.</P>
<P>A distemper prevales in these parts,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SWELLED LEGS.</NOTE> supposed to arise from the badness of the water, or from an impoverished state of blood from poor living. Its symptoms are a violent swelling in one, and sometimes in both legs, so that it is not uncommon to see them a yard in circuit round the ancle
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Plate 65, in Linscottan's Voyage.</NOTE>. It is not attended with any pain, but with an itching; the swollen leg is not heavier than the unaffected. The distemper is called the <HI>Cochin-leg,</HI> and, from the size, the <HI>Elephant-leg;</HI> no remedy has yet been discovered. The <HI>Dutch</HI> procure their water in boats from a distant place, yet <HI>Hamilton</HI> says, that he had seen both men and women of that nation afflicted with the malady. This destroys the hypothesis of its being the effect either of the water or of poor living.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>Cochin</HI> to the termination of the islands, the coast is flat, and so low, as to be distinguished only by the trees, or by the flags on the ensign staffs; the sea clear of shoals, and with good soundings.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PORCAH.</NOTE> <HI>Porcah,</HI> on the island beyond <HI>Cochin,</HI> is a small <HI>Dutch</HI> settlement.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">COULANG.</NOTE> <HI>Quilon,</HI> or rather <HI>Coulang,</HI> is another, now sunk into an inconsiderable place. On the first arrival of the <HI>Portuguese</HI> it was governed by a Queen-Regent, who ruled
<PB N="173" REF="195"/>over a small principality.

It was taken from the <HI>Portuguese</HI> by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> in 1662.

<P>To this place there continues a similarity of low, and morassy country. At a few miles distance, to the south of <HI>Coulang,</HI> the coast immediately alters, the land rises into high and precipitous red cliffs; near them is good fresh water; at <HI>Anjenga,</HI>

They pay for the ground rent to the queen of the coun∣try. By my frequent mention of the Queen, it should seem, that a female reign in these parts was not uncustomary. The trade of the neighborhood is pepper, and a fine long cloth. Mr. <HI>Franklin,</HI> p. 7, remarks, that this is the best place in <HI>India</HI> for intelligence, and that very lately a post to several parts of <HI>India</HI> has been established. "A regular post," says Mr. <HI>Rennel,</HI> p. 317,
<Q>is established throughout the parts of <HI>Hindoostan</HI> sub∣ject to the <HI>East India</HI> Company, and also from <HI>Calcutta</HI> to <HI>Madras.</HI> The postmen always travel on foot. Their stages are commonly from seven to eight miles; and their rate of

<P>CAPE <HI>Comorin,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CAPE COMO∣RIN.</NOTE> the most southern part of <HI>Hindooslan,</HI> is in Lat. 8°. It is level low land at its extremity, and covered with trees, and not visible from the deck more than four or five leagues. Mr. <HI>Thomas Daniell</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Words are wanting to express the merit, beauty, and elegance of his present publication of the views in <HI>Hindooslan.</HI></NOTE> to whom I am indebted for numbers of informations, informs me, that the lostiest part is the <HI>highland of Comorin,</HI> which is twelve hundred and ninety∣four yards high: and quite smooth and verdant to the very summit. Near the base, bursts forth a most magnificent cata∣ract: and near that is a <HI>Choultry</HI> for the accommodation of tra∣vellers.</P>
<P>A LITTLE to the northward is the termination of the <HI>Ghauts,</HI> which may be seen nine or ten leagues at sea. This was the <HI>Comar</HI> of <HI>Arrian,</HI> ii. 175, where there was a castle and a port. The sea adjacent was supposed to have been en∣dued with peculiar virtues; it was a great resort for the pur∣poses of ablutions, and lustrations, by all such persons who had determined to pass a religious and solitary life. The female sex performed the same rites. Written history had, even in <HI>Arrian</HI>'s time, delivered a legend of a certain goddess having here performed the ablutions every month. The district was called <HI>Comari Regio;</HI> but this holy water reached, says <HI>Arrian,</HI> as far as <HI>Colchos,</HI> the modern <HI>Mingrelia. Al. Edrisi</HI> speaks, p. 31, of a <HI>Comr. Insula,</HI> and gives it a vast extent. There is a little
<PB N="175" REF="197"/>hill to the north of the cape, which from the sea appears in∣sulated: possibly the <HI>Nubian</HI> Geographer might have received an account of that eminence, mistaken for an island, and its size exaggerated.</P>
<P>CAPE <HI>Comorin</HI> is the termination of the kingdom of <HI>Travan∣core,</HI> Which extends along the western coast,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">KINGDOM OF TRAYANCORE.</NOTE> from that of <HI>Cran∣ganore,</HI> as far as this headland, a hundred and forty miles. In 1730 it began to rise into importance, by the abilities of its mo∣narch, who reigned forty years. In giving audience to two embassadors, whom he foresaw would weary him with prolix harangues, he cut the first short with this sensible remark; "<HI>Be not tedious,</HI>" says he, "<HI>life is short.</HI>" He raised a fine army, and well disciplined, and meditated the conquest of <HI>Malabar.</HI> Amidst all his great talents, he mingled the weakness of being ashamed of his <HI>cast</HI> or <HI>tribe.</HI> He wished to be a <HI>Brahmin;</HI> he ordered a golden calf to be made, he entered at the mouth, and came out at the opposite part; this was his <HI>Metempsychosis;</HI> and he dated all his edicts from the days, says Abbé <HI>Raynal,</HI> of this glorious regeneration.</P>
<P>THIS kingdom begins in Lat. 10° 18′, near <HI>Cranganore.</HI> The breadth is greatly contracted, by reason of the approach of the <HI>Ghauts</HI> towards the shore. Intersected by rivers, and covered with thick woods, it seems almost unconquerable. The <HI>Rajah,</HI> whom I have mentioned, gave his country ad∣ditional strength, by which he saved his successor from the oppression of the rising usurper, <HI>Ayder Alli.</HI>
<Q>Around his capital, and chief province,</Q> says the author of the War in <HI>Asia,</HI> i. p. 266,
<Q>he suffered the woods to grow for a number of
<PB N="176" REF="198"/>years, till they formed an impenetrable belt of great depth. This, cut into labyrinths, afforded easy egress to his people, and rendered all attacks from without impracticable. Im∣mured within this natural fortification, he encouraged the cultivation of the arts and sciences: he invited the approach of men of genius and knowledge; he cultivated the friend∣ship of the <HI>Brahmins,</HI> and was himself admitted into their society, by the ceremony of passing, (as <HI>Raynel</HI> says) through a golden cow, which became the property of the <HI>Brahmins,</HI> the cow being sacred in <HI>India,</HI> as formerly in <HI>Egypt;</HI> and by preparing his own military stores, casting cannon, making gunpowder, &amp;c. he rendered himself independent of foreign aid. The subjects of his remoter provinces, who, to avoid the ravages of war, had taken refuge within the woody circle, now returned with their families and effects to their former habitations.</Q> This mode of fortification he evidently copied from his wild neighbors, the <HI>Polygars;</HI> but they live in almost a savage state, while he adopted their plan to secure the cultiva∣tion of the mild arts of peace!</P>
<P>EVEN the approach to this difficult retreat was impeded by the famous lines of <HI>Travancore,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">LINES OF TRA∣VANCORE.</NOTE> which extend from the fouth∣ern banks of the river of <HI>Cranganore,</HI> close to sea, to the foot of the <HI>Ghauts,</HI> strongly fortified in their whole extent: These proved the first check to the ambition of <HI>Tippoo Sultan.</HI> He wished to provoke the <HI>Rajah</HI> to begin hostilities, in order that he might not be charged with being aggressor. For several days, from the 23d to the 28th of <HI>December</HI> 1789, the <HI>Sultan</HI>'s horsemen rode up to the <HI>Rajah</HI>'s lines, and made use of
<PB N="177" REF="199"/>every insulting expedient to draw the first act of hostility from the <HI>Travancore</HI> troops; but finding them aware of his artifice, and that a detachment of <HI>English</HI> troops was stationed at some dis∣tance, he at last gave way to his rage, and on the 29th of <HI>Decem∣ber</HI> attacked the lines by storm. His troops had filled the foss with cotton. They passed by that means into the interior of the lines, when, by some accident, the cotton took fire, and the whole formed a tremendous blaze. In their rear were the flames; in front a furious enemy. Actuated by despair, they fought with incredible valour: out of fifteen hundred men, only forty were taken, the rest fell victims to the rage of the <HI>Travan∣corian</HI> defendants
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mackensie's Sketch, i. p. 18.</NOTE>. <HI>Tippoo,</HI> from the outside of the lines, was a spectator of the horrid carnage of his soldiers. The <HI>Nayrs</HI> pressed on him on all sides, and being repulsed with dis∣grace, and himself thrown from his horse in the retreat, he is said to have made an oath, that he never would wear his tur∣ban again, till he had taken the <HI>Rajah</HI>'s lines, and accordingly he prepared to attack them by regular approach
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dirom's Campaigns, 257.</NOTE>. On <HI>April</HI> 12, 1790, he completely executed his menaces.

<P>THIS little dominion

It is a beautiful scene to contemplate; a delightful journey to the traveller; but a most arduous march, and formidable barrier to an invading army.</Q></P>
<P>FROM Cape <HI>Comorin</HI> I take my departure for the island of <HI>Ceylon,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ISLE OF CAL∣PENTYN.</NOTE> the nearest part of which, the isle of <HI>Calpentyn,</HI> is about a hundred and fifty miles distant. The intervening sea is the gulph of <HI>Manaar,</HI> which grows narrower and narrower till it reaches the fragments of the prior junction with the continent, of which Cape <HI>Koiel,</HI> a large promontory of the <HI>Marawars,</HI> and various rocks, are parts. The Cape will be described in my progress from Cape <HI>Comorin</HI> along the eastern coasts of <HI>Hin∣doostan.</HI></P>
<P>BEFORE <HI>Cape Koiel</HI> is the <HI>insula-solis</HI> of <HI>Pliny,</HI> lib. vi. 22,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">RAMANA KOIEL.</NOTE> the isle of <HI>Ramana Koiel,</HI> or the isle of the temple of the god <HI>Rama,</HI> founded near the edge of the water, and on vast stones, to break the force of that element. <HI>Rama</HI> had a right to a temple opposite to <HI>Ceylon,</HI> for he killed the giant <HI>Ravanen,</HI> king of that island, and placed his brother, <HI>Vibouchanen,</HI> on the throne. <HI>Rama</HI> was highly venerated in this country. The capital of the <HI>Marawars,</HI> and the residence of the prince, was named, in honor of the deity, <HI>Ramana-dabaram.</HI> The passage between this island and the continent is called <HI>Odioroa</HI> passage. It is extremely short, about five miles broad, and not exceeding in depth three feet.</P>
<P>FROM the eastern end of the isle of <HI>Ramana Koiel,</HI> is a chain of rocks which runs quite across the narrow channel to the isle
<PB N="182" REF="204"/>of <HI>Manaar,</HI> almost adjacent to the <HI>Ceylonese</HI> shore: the length is about thirty miles, but the whole chain is frequently inter∣fected by narrow passages, so very shallow, says <HI>d'Apres,</HI> in his <HI>Neptune Oriental,</HI> p. 85, as to be navigable only by the small crast of the neighboring shore, and that only in calm weather, so disturbed is the channel in gales by a dreadful surf. The little vessels that wish to make the passage, go under <HI>Manaar,</HI> where they must unload, pay duty to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> get their ves∣sel dragged through the pass, and take in their cargo on the other side. It is very probable, that this succession of rocks was part of an isthmus, which in very early times had united <HI>Ceylon</HI> and the continent; for the water on each side of this chain, does not exceed thirteen or fourteen feet. <HI>Pliny,</HI> in the passage before cited, takes notice of the greenish cast of this part of the channel, of its being filled with shrubs, that is, with corals; and of its being so shallow, that the rowers often brushed off the tops with their oars.</P>
<P>THIS chain of rocks is called <HI>Adam's Bridge;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ADAM'S BRIDGE.</NOTE> the tradition is, that our common father, after his transgression, was cast down from <HI>Paradise,</HI> and fell upon <HI>Ceylon;</HI> but that afterwards, this bridge was made by angels for him to pass over to the continent.</P>
<P><HI>Manaar</HI> is, as the name implies, sandy. The little channel is on the eastern side, and defended by a strong fort, garrisoned with a hundred men, notwithstanding it is impassable for any vessels which draw more than four or five feet water. It had on it seven churches, built by the <HI>Portuguese.</HI> The natives were converted by St. <HI>Francis de Xavier,</HI> and still continue professors
<PB N="183" REF="205"/>of <HI>Christianity,</HI> notwithstanding they have labored under many persecutions. The pearl mussel is found in great abundance on this coast, and the fishery has, at different times, been attended with good success, since the <HI>Dutch</HI> have become masters. <HI>Pliny</HI> says, that the greatest plenty were found in his days on the coasts of <HI>Tabrohana,</HI> and <HI>Toidis,</HI> and <HI>Perimula,</HI> on the peninsula of <HI>Malacca.</HI></P>
<P>A SPECIES of <HI>Manati</HI> is certainly found here. <HI>Baldaeus,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MANATI.</NOTE> a learned clergyman, who resided long in <HI>Ceylon,</HI> describes it (<HI>Churchill</HI>'s Coll. iii. 793) so exactly, that we cannot mistake the animal he intended.
<Q>Here is a peculiar fish (properly a sea-calf) of an amphibious nature; the females have breasts, and give suck, and the flesh, when well boil'd, tastes not unlike our sturgeon, and might easily be mistaken for veal.</Q></P>
<P>FROM <HI>Manaar</HI> is the very short passage into the great island of CEYLON, known to the antients by the name of <HI>Tabrobana.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CEYLON.</NOTE> I will not attempt to expose their mistakes in respect to extent, and some other particulars, as long as the identity of the isle is ascer∣tained. <HI>Strabo</HI> mentions it in lib. xv. p. 1013,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">STRABO's ACCOUNT OF.</NOTE> noticing the aukwardness of the inhabitants in failing, and fitting their masts in their vessels. Along the coasts are observed various amphi∣bious animals, among which he plainly includes <HI>Manati;</HI> some he compares to oxen, others to horses, and other land animals; the <HI>Dugung, (De Busson,</HI> xiii. 374, tab. lvi.) may possibly have
<PB N="184" REF="206"/>been among them. This <HI>Strabo</HI> delivers from the account left by <HI>Onesicritus,</HI> a follower of <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, who sent him on a voyage to <HI>India,</HI> where he informed himself of many things, among which is no small share of fable, or misrepre∣sented accounts.</P>
<P><HI>Mela</HI> speaks of this island as the part of another world,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MELA's.</NOTE> and that it never was circumnavigated.</P>
<P><HI>Pliny,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PLINY's.</NOTE> lib. vi. c. 22, gives us a large chapter on the subject of this island: he not only gives the authority of <HI>Megasthenes,</HI> who had written a history of <HI>India,</HI> and of <HI>Eratosthenes,</HI> a famous geometrician, who pretended to give the circumference of <HI>Ceylon,</HI> but has drawn many lights from the four embassadors actually sent from this island to <HI>Rome,</HI> in the time of <HI>Claudius.</HI> By accident, a freed slave of a farmer of the <HI>Roman</HI> customs in the <HI>Red</HI> Sea, was driven to the coast of <HI>Ceylon</HI> by a storm; such an impression did he make on the king of the island by his favorable report of the <HI>Romans,</HI> that determined him to send these envoys. From them many particulars were learned; they were not sparing of any thing which tended to exalt the glory of their country: they said that it contained five hunded cities; the chief was <HI>Palesimundum,</HI> that had two hundred thousand citizens. For other particulars I refer to the old historian; more is beyond my plan.</P>
<P><HI>Ptolemy</HI> comes next,

He mentions rice, honey, ginger, beryls, hyacinths; and gold, silver, and other metals; and he agrees with <HI>Pliny</HI> about its producing elephants and tigers. He also says, the antient name of <HI>Ceylon</HI> was <HI>Symondi,</HI> but in his days it

<P>THE island rises from on every side to the mountains, which run in chains, principally from north to south. The highest and rudest tract is the kingdom of <HI>Conde Uda,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CONDE UDA.</NOTE> which is imper∣vious, by reason of rocks and forests, except by narrow paths, which are also impeded by gates of thorns, closely watched by guards. At the western skirt of these mountains soars <HI>Hamalell,</HI> and,

On the summit is a flat stone, with an impression resembling a human foot, two feet long, it is called that of our great and common ancestor. The <HI>Cingalese,</HI> or aborigines of <HI>Ceylon,</HI> say that it is of <HI>Buddo,</HI> their great deity, when he ascended into heaven, from whom they expect salvation.

<P>ALL the rest of the isle, except some marshy flats adapted to the culture of rice, are broken into thousands of hills, beauti∣fully cloathed with wood. The intervening valleys are often morassy, or consisting of a rich fat soil; but the fertility of the open parts is astonishingly great.</P>
<P>THE account given by <HI>Ptolemy</HI> of the mineral or fossil pro∣ductions, is, in a great measure, confirmed.

But what occasions the neglect of the mines, and of the gems, is the at∣tention to the great staple of the island, the important bark of the cinnamon. Doctor <HI>Thunberg</HI> is very exact in his account of the gems of <HI>Ceylon,</HI> Travels, iv. 215. They are dug up about <HI>Matura,</HI> and the liberty of search is farmed for no more

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Knox, 72, 73, 75. Kaempser's Hist. Japan, i. 241.</NOTE>.

The <HI>pa∣godas</HI> are numerous, and many of them, like several in <HI>India,</HI> of hewn-stone, most richly and exquisitely carved. The <HI>Cingalese</HI> believe <HI>Buddo</HI> to have come upon earth; and that to him be∣longed the salvation of souls: all human happiness, say they, proceeds from him: all evil, from the devil, to whom he per∣mits the power of punishment.

<P>THE civil government is monarchical.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">GOVERNMENT.</NOTE> The emperor, in the time of <HI>Knox,</HI> was absolute, and clamed the most undisputable
<PB N="191" REF="213"/>right over the lives and fortunes of all his subjects. He was a most barbarous tyrant, and took a diabolical delight in putting his subjects to the most cruel and lingering deaths. Elephants were often the executioners of his vengeance, and were directed to pull the unhappy criminals limb from limb with their trunks, and scatter them to the birds of the air, or beasts of the field. The emperor's residence was at <HI>Candy,</HI> nearly in the center of the island; but he was, in <HI>Knox</HI>'s time, by the rebellion of his subjects, obliged to desert that city. The government is said, by <HI>Wolff,</HI> p. 235, to be at present very mild, and regulated by the statute laws of the land, the joint production of divers wise princes, and are considered as sacred by the <HI>Cingalese.</HI> It is pos∣sible that the tyrant, in the days of <HI>Knox,</HI> had destroyed the liberties of his country, which were afterwards restored.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ROBERT KNOX.</NOTE> The author <HI>Robert Knox</HI> is a writer fully to be depended on; a plain honest man, who, in 1657, sailed in one of the <HI>East India</HI> Com∣pany's ships to <HI>Madras;</HI> and on the return, in 1659, was forced by a storm into <HI>Ceylon,</HI> to refit: when his father (who was cap∣tain) went on shore, and, with sixteen more of the crew, were seized by the emperor's soldiers, and detained. The Captain died in a year's time. Our author lived nineteen years in the island, and saw the greatest part of it. At length, with difficulty, he escaped, and arrived safe in <HI>England,</HI> in <HI>September</HI> 1680. His history of the island, and of his adventures, were published in 1680; and appears to be the only authentic account of the inter∣nal parts, and the only one that can be entirely relied on.</P>
<P>THERE is in this island a race of wild men, called <HI>Wedas,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">WEDAS, OR BEDAS.</NOTE> or <HI>Bedas;</HI> they speak the <HI>Cingalese</HI> language, but inhabit the depth
<PB N="192" REF="214"/>of woods, and the fastnesses of the mountains, and are, in all respects, as savage as the domesticated animals are in the state of nature.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">OR BARBARI.</NOTE> I suspect them to be what <HI>Solinus</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polyhistor, c. 65. These may be the same with the <HI>Wedas,</HI> which Solinus says, made a trade of selling parrots to the Romans.</NOTE> calls <HI>Barbari,</HI> to distinguish them from other <HI>Indians</HI> in a state of civilization; for I think I have met with elsewhere, the distinction between a wild people, and others in a polished state of manners.</P>
<P>THESE <HI>Wedas</HI> wear their hair long, collect it together, and tie it on the crown of the head in a bunch. Their complexions are, comparative to the other <HI>Cingalese,</HI> light: they inhabit the depth of woods, and their skins, that way, escape the effect of the burning sun. They live entirely on flesh, or on roots; the first they either eat raw, or dried, or preserved in honey. They live either in caves, or under a tree, with the boughs cut and laid round about them to give notice when any wild beasts come near, which they may hear by their rustling and trampling upon them
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 62.</NOTE>. They are like them, without law, and, as <HI>Wolf,</HI> page 259, says, without religion. <HI>Knox,</HI> p. p. 61, 62, asserts the contrary. The wilder sort never shew themselves; the tamer will enter into some kind of commerce with their civili∣zed countrymen. Their dress is only a cloth wrapped round their waists, and brought between their legs. A small ax is usually stuck in the wrapper. They are skilful archers, and very nice in their arrows. The heads are of iron, made by the smiths of the civilized people. They have no other means of bespeaking them, than leaving near the shop a pattern, cut out of a leaf, with a piece of flesh by way of reward: If he does the
<PB N="193" REF="215"/>work, they bring him more meat, otherwise they shoot him in the night.</P>
<P>AFTER this account of the lowest of the human race,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ELEPHANT.</NOTE> I fear I shall injure the half reasoning elephant, on putting him on a level with such of our own species as have scarcely any of the reasoning particles left. This island was celebrated by <HI>Pliny,</HI> lib. viii. c. 9, for its race of elephants, which were larger, and more adapted for war, than those of <HI>India.</HI> He also gives the methods of capture
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. viii. c. 8.</NOTE>. They are, at present, taken in different manners, and after being tamed, are sent to the great annual fair at <HI>Jaffanapatam.</HI> The merchants of <HI>Malabar</HI> and <HI>Bengal,</HI> have notice of the numbers and qualities of the elephants to be set up to sale; sometimes a hundred are sold at one fair. A full grown beast, twelve or fourteen feet high, will be sold at the rate of two thousand dollars.</P>
<P>THE manner of taking these huge animals is thus described by Doctor <HI>Thunberg,</HI> iv. p. 240, who undertook a journey up the country to see what the <HI>Dutch</HI> call an <HI>Elephant-toil,</HI> or <HI>snare,</HI> "which served for capturing and inclosing a great number of elephants. The toil was constructed of stout cocoa trees, almost in the form of a triangle, the side nearest to the wood being very broad, and augmented with slighter trees and bushes, which gradually extended themselves into two long and impercepti∣ble wings. The narrower end was strongly fortified with stakes, planted close to each other, and held firmly together by ropes, and became at length so narrow, that only one single
<PB N="194" REF="216"/>elephant could squeeze itself into the opening. When the governor gives orders for an elephant chace on the company's account, which happens at the expiration of a certain number of years, it is performed in the following manner: A great multitude of men, as well <HI>European</HI> as <HI>Cingalese,</HI> are sent out into the woods, in the same manner in which people go out on a general hunt for wolves and bears in the north of <HI>Europe.</HI> These diffuse themselves, and encompass a certain extent of land which has been discovered to be frequented by elephants. After this they gradually draw nearer, and with great noise, vociferation, and beat of drum, contract the area of the circle; in the mean time the elephants approach nearer and nearer to the side on which the toil is placed. Finally, torches are lighted up, in order to terrify still more these huge animals, and force them to enter into the toil prepared for them. As soon as they all have entered, the toil is closed up behind them. The last time that elephants were caught in this manner, their numbers amounted to upwards of a hundred, and on former occasions has sometimes amounted to one hundred and thirty."</P>
<P>"THE first care of the captors, is to bring them out of the toil, and to tame them. For this purpose one or two tame elephants are placed at the side where the opening is, through which each elephant is let out singly, when he is immediately bound fast, with strong ropes, to the tame ones, who discipline him with their proboscis, till he likewise becomes tame, and suffers himself to be handled and managed at pleasure. This discipli∣nary correction frequently proceeds very briskly, and is some∣times accomplished in a few days, especially as the wild elephant is at the same time brought under control by hunger."</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="217"/>THE horses of the island are descended from the <HI>Arabian</HI> breed.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">HORSE.</NOTE> These are kept in a wild state, in certain islands called <HI>Ilbas de Cavallos.</HI> They are at certain times forced into the ponds and rivers, and caught by people, who, in the most dex∣terous manner, fling over any part they please a noose. These are sent to a fair, immediately following the elephant fair, and sold for large prices. The peasants make no sort of use of horses; but in their place employ the buffalo, which they catch and tame for the cart, and all their rural work

They are as large as a blood-hound, and are able to catch hold of a child, and run up with it to the top of the loftiest trees; and after admiring it for some time, they will lay it gently down on the place they took it from. These are very numerous, and very audacious, and will rob the corn fields and gardens in the very face of the owners, and as soon as they are driven out of one end of the field, will come skipping into the other, and fill both their bellies and hands. Of late years it has been discovered, by a <HI>Russian</HI> tanner, that their skins might be dressed, and made into shoes.</P>

<P>BEARS,

<P>THE <HI>Civet,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CIVET.</NOTE> N<SUP>o</SUP> 274, is frequent in <HI>Ceylon.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Mungo,</HI> or <HI>Indian Ichneumon,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 255, is found here. This weesel is famous for its antipathy to the <HI>Naja,</HI> or <HI>Cobra de Capello,</HI> and for its instant recourse to the antidote to the fatal
<PB N="197" REF="219"/>bite, on its receiving a wound from that dreadful serpent. The plants it seeks relief from, are the <HI>Ophiorrhiza Mungos, Strych∣nos Colubrina,</HI> and <HI>Ophioxylon serpentinum.</HI> The last is figured in <HI>Burman. Zeylan.</HI> 141. tab. 64, and in <HI>Rumph. Amboin.</HI> vi. 25, tab. xvi.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Naja</HI> is found all over the hotter parts of <HI>India,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NAJA.</NOTE> and is distinguished by a mark on the back of the head, of the form of a pair of spectacles, also by the power of dilating the skin of the head into the form of a hood, from which it has gotten the name of the <HI>Cobra de Capello,</HI> or hooded snake. They grow from four to eight or nine feet in length, and are justly dreaded by the <HI>Indians.</HI> Their bite is generally mortal, yet there is a remedy (if timely applied) that has its efficacy. The mortal effect some∣times takes place in a quarter of an hour, sometimes in two or three hours. In its fatal <HI>sacculus</HI> it seems to contain the poisons of the <HI>Seps,</HI> one of <HI>Lucan</HI>'s deadly list
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Manant humeri fortesque lacerti: Colla caputque fluunt: calido non ocius austro Nix resoluta cadet, nee solem cera sequetur.</NOTE>. An universal gangrene takes place, and the flesh falls from the bones; con∣vulsions sometimes bring on death, according to the degree of <HI>virus,</HI> on which the symptoms depend.</P>
<P>THIS species never distends its hood but when it is agitated by some passion, such as fear, or rage, it then quits its creeping attitude, raises the fore part of the body a third of its whole length, spreads its hood, and moves its head around, darting a fiery glare to every part, often remaining in all other respects immoveable; or its motion becomes slow, steady, and cautious,
<PB N="198" REF="220"/>so that in <HI>India</HI> it is held to be the emblem of Prudence; it is also held in veneration equal to a deity. The legends of the country are full of strange tales relating to its actions; they call it <HI>Nella Pambou,</HI> or the <HI>good serpent;</HI> it is often represented twisted round the deities, under the name of <HI>Calengam,</HI> in me∣mory of the victory of one of their gods, over an enormous <HI>Naja.</HI></P>
<P>THIS certainly is not the <HI>Deaf Adder.</HI> The <HI>Indian</HI> jugglers, especially those of <HI>Malabar,</HI> have a power of taming these dreadful animals, and instructing them to dance, after the in∣harmonious and slow air of their flagelets. The serpent first seems astonished, then begins to rear himself, and sometimes by a gentle motion of the head, and with distended hood, seems to listen with pleasure to the notes. This is said not to be peculiar to those which are accustomed to the exercise, but even the snakes newly taken, will shew the same disposition, and fling themselves into the same attitudes.</P>
<P><HI>Nieuhoff</HI> gives a plate of these jugglers, and their snakes, and <HI>Kaempfer</HI> a much better.</P>
<P>I SHALL mention here two or three <HI>Indian</HI> serpents, described by M. <HI>d'Obsonville,</HI> notwithstanding I am uncertain of their native place; one is called, in <HI>French, le Javclot,</HI> a species of <HI>Ja∣culus,</HI> of a green color, five or six feet long, and most fatal in its bite. It generally lurks, extended or suspended, among the branches of trees. So situated, that they either can dart on their prey, such as little birds or insects, or remove themselves with

<P>THE <HI>Poison-Snake</HI> is only two feet long, and very slender,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">POISON-SNAKE.</NOTE> and freckled with pale brown or red. Its bite brings death as rapidly as <HI>Lucan</HI>'s <HI>Volucer serpens.</HI> Our author saw a <HI>Gentoo</HI> bit by one. The sufferer could only give a shriek, and advance a few steps, when he fell down dead.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Burning-serpent</HI> seems to possess the dreadful poison of three species:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BURNING-SER∣PENT.</NOTE> It gives by its bite the symptoms of raging fire, like the <HI>Torrida dipsas.</HI> It causes, at other times, the blood to flow through every pore, like the <HI>Hoemorrhoïs;</HI> at other times, to cause swelling like the <HI>Prester,</HI> and to incite racking pains; at length, by a happy numbness, death brings kindly relief to the miserable sufferer. The Reverend <HI>Edward Terry</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage, in 1615, p. 381.</NOTE> saw a criminal put to death at <HI>Amedavad,</HI> with all the effects of the bite of the <HI>Dipsas</HI> and of the <HI>Prester.</HI> This species much re∣sembles the last in form; both inhabit dry, hot, and rocky places; and live on insects full of saline and acrimonious parti∣cles, which cannot fail of exalting the <HI>virus</HI> of the serpents that make them their food.</P>

<P>THE <HI>Lacerta Gekko</HI> is a species justly dreaded for the poison, which exudes even from the ends of its toes, and which infects, to a degree of fatality, any thing it passes over; its urine and saliva are equally dangerous; its voice, which is acute, like that of a cricket, flings a whole company into consternation. The <HI>Indians</HI> obtain from it a deadly poison for their arrows. They

<P><PB N="206" REF="228"/>IT is impossible not to mention the tailor bird,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TAILOR-BIRD.</NOTE> <HI>Ind. Zool.</HI> tab. viii, a warbler; on account of its wonderful nest; my own account of its oeconomy, taken from the <HI>Indian Zoology,</HI> page 44, deserves attention. It is thus introduced:</P>
<P><Q>HAD Providence left the feathered tribe unendowed with any particular instinct, the birds of the torrid zone would have built their nests in the same unguarded manner as those of <HI>Europe:</HI> but there, the lesser species, having a certain prescience of the dangers that surround them, and of their own weakness, suspend their nest at the extreme branches of the trees: they are conscious of inhabiting a climate replete with enemies to them and their young; with snakes that twine up the bodies of the trees, and apes that are perpetu∣ally in search of prey; but, heaven-instructed, they clude the gliding of the one, and the activity of the other.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE brute creation in the torrid zone, are more at enmity with one another, than in other climates; and the birds are obliged to exert unusual artifice in placing their little broods out of the reach of an invader. Each aims at the same end, though by different means. Some form their penfile nest in shape of a purse, deep, and open at top; others, with a hole in the side; and others, still more cautious, with an entrance at the very bottom, forming their lodge near the summit.</Q></P>
<P><Q>BUT the little species we describe, seems to have greater diffidence than any of the others; it will not trust its nest even to the extremity of a slender twig, but makes one more advance to safety, by sixing it to the leaf itself.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="229"/><Q>IT picks up a dead leaf, and, surprising to relate, sews it to the side of a living one, its slender bill being its needle, and its thread some fine sibres; the lining, feathers, gossamer, and down. Its eggs are white: the color of the bird, light yellow; its length three inches; its weight only three six∣teenths of an ounce; so that the materials of the nest, and its own size, are not likely to draw down a habitation that de∣pends on so slight a tenure.</Q></P>
<P>Two fly-catchers, of uncommon form,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">FLY-CATCHER.</NOTE> attract the eyes of all strangers: small birds, with tails of enormous length, darting through the air like arrows. Both are engraved by Mr. <HI>Ed∣wards,</HI> one in tab. 113, of a black and white color, with a cunei∣form tail; the other with a rufous back and tail, and two fea∣thers exceeding the others in length by near nine inches.</P>
<P>As these are remarkable for the length of their tails, a pie, engraven by Mr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> in tab. 324, is distinguished for the ridiculous brevity of that part, and also for the beauty of its colors. <HI>Linnaeus</HI> calls it <HI>Corvus Brachyurus.</HI></P>
<P>SWALLOWS (I do not know the species) never quit <HI>Ceylon.</HI></P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">PIGEON.</NOTE> The pompadour pigeon of this island, <HI>Brown's Illustr.</HI> tab. xix. xx. the general color of which is a fine pale green; the male dis∣tinguished by having the coverts of the wings of a fine pom∣padour color, is one proof. I mention this in particular, on account of its history; but more so for that of the magnificent tree on which it usually alights to seed.</P>
<P>THIS species swarms in certain seasons in the island of <HI>Cey∣lon,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">FICUS INDICA.</NOTE> particularly when the fruit of the <HI>Ficus Indica,</HI> or broad
<PB N="208" REF="230"/>leaved <HI>Waringen,</HI> is ripe. They alight in vast multitudes on that grotesque tree, and are caught with bird-lime by the na∣tives, who prepare the twigs against their arrival. Mr. <HI>Loten</HI> in∣formed me, that when he was governor in <HI>Ceylon,</HI> one morning at break of day he saw some hundreds entangled on the boughs of the great <HI>Waringen</HI> tree, before his window, and ordered one of his <HI>Ceylonese</HI> servants to take them off. They are excellent food, and are often shot by the <HI>Europeans.</HI> They are observed never to alight on the ground, but to perch on high trees, and give this the preference, on account of the fruit. It is for the same reason the haunt of various other birds; but notwith∣standing the sweetness of the fruit, it is neglected by mankind.</P>
<P>THIS tree immediately attracted the attention of the antients. <HI>Onesicritus,</HI> the philosopher who followed <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great in his expedition into <HI>India,</HI> commanded his galley, and re∣corded his actions, first gives us an account of this wonderful tree. For this, at lest, he does not merit the severe remark made on him by <HI>Strabo,</HI> lib. xv. p. 1022, who seems incredulous to all he says; possibly there may be other points in which he may be also defended. This tree rises high in the air, then drops its boughs, which take root, and successively create new stems, till a vast extent is covered with the arched shade. It is even said to form of itself a forest of arched avenues, and a labyrinth of alleys, impenetrable by the rays of the vertical sun; perhaps the extent may be exaggerated. We will con∣tent ourselves with giving the dimensions of one near <HI>Manjee,</HI> west of <HI>Patna;</HI> the diameter of which was from three hundred and sixty three feet, to three hundred and seventy three: the
<PB N="209" REF="231"/>circumference of the shadow at noon, eleven hundred and six∣teen; that of the several stems, which were no more than fifty or sixty, nine hundred and twenty-one. Hundreds of people may find a comfortable retreat beneath its foliage. Such is the account given by the veracious Mr. <HI>Marsden,</HI> in page 131 of his excellent history of <HI>Sumatra.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pliny,</HI> lib. xii. c. 5, gives the fullest description; he was best qualified, for by the time he lived, the <HI>Romans</HI> got tolerably well acquainted with the country. His account is elegant and faithful: speaking of the trees of <HI>India,</HI> he says—<Q>Ficus ibi exilia poma habet. Ipsa se semper serens, vastis diffunditur ramis: quorum imi adeo in terram curvantur, ut annuo spatio infigantur, novamque sibi propaginem faciant circa parentem in orbem, quodam opere topiario. Intra sepem eam, aestivant pastores, opacam pariter, et munitam vallo arboris, decora specie subter intuenti, proculve, fornicato am∣bitu. Superiores ejus rami in excelsum emicant, silvosa mul∣titudine, vasto matris corpore, ut lx. p. pleraeque orbe col∣ligant, umbra vero bina stadia operiant. Foliorum latitudo peltae effigiem Amazonicae habet: ea causa fructum integens, crescere prohibet. Rarusque est, nec fabae magnitudinem excedens; sed per solia solibus coctus proedulci sapore, dig∣nus miraculo arboris.</Q> He concludes with saying, that it was found chiefly about the <HI>Accsines,</HI> the modern <HI>Jenauh,</HI> which, falling into the famous <HI>Hydaspes,</HI> the <HI>Behut,</HI> proves its growth in those days, at lest as far north as Lat. 30° 30′.

Others again have supposed this tree to have been the tree of life, and to have furnished the leaves with which our first pa∣rents betrayed their sense of shame after the fall. <HI>Milton</HI> adopts the last opinion, and gives us the following beautiful version of the <HI>Latin</HI> naturalist:—

<NOTE PLACE="marg">MONSTROUS SEPIA.</NOTE> I shall remark that the <HI>Sepia Oc∣topodia, Br. Zool.</HI> iv. N<SUP>o</SUP> 44, grows in the <HI>Indian</HI> seas to a most amazing size. A friend of mine, long resident among the <HI>Indian</HI> isles, and a diligent observer of nature, informed me that the natives assirm, that some have been seen two fathoms broad over their centre, and that each arm was nine fathoms long. When the <HI>Indians</HI> navigate their little boats, they go in dread of them; and lest these animals should fling their arms over and sink them, they never fail without an ax to cut them off.</P>
<P>THESE may parallel the enormous <HI>Polypus,</HI> or <HI>Sepia,</HI> described by <HI>Pliny,</HI> lib. ix. c. 30, which made its nightly invasions on the magazines of salt-fish at <HI>Carteia,</HI> and long put both men and dogs at defiance.</P>
<P><HI>Ceylon</HI> is peculiarly happy in its <HI>Flora;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">VEGETABLES.</NOTE> the trees and vege∣tables of <HI>India</HI> seem crowded within its limits. There may be local vegetables in this island, and others again on the conti∣nent; but I fear my deficiency in botanical knowledge will de∣prive me of the power of pointing them out. <HI>Ceylon</HI> has been likewise peculiarly happy in its florists, who have enumerated and described its vegetable treasures. From their labors I shall mention those of most striking use, beauty, or singularity, with references to the authorities and figures. My chief guide will be the <HI>Flora Zeylanica,</HI> compiled by <HI>Linnaeus</HI> from the manu∣scripts of <HI>Paul Herman,</HI> who from the year 1670 to 1677 had made several botanizing journeys through the island, with great hazard to himself, and at vast expence to the states of <HI>Holland.</HI> These had been lost above fifty years, and then dis∣covered and communicated, in 1745, by <HI>Augustus Gunther,</HI> apo∣thecary
<PB N="216" REF="238"/>at <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> to <HI>Linnaeus,</HI> who reduced the plants into system, and published the <HI>Flora</HI> at <HI>Stockholm,</HI> in 1747. <HI>Burman</HI> favored us with his <HI>Thesaurus Zeylanicus</HI> in 1737, a quarto, en∣riched with 110 plates.

The kernel may be noxious when eaten to excess, and even fatal, which may be the case with the best things. In <HI>Malabar</HI> it is called <HI>Odallam. Rheede,</HI> i. p. 71, asserts, that it is a common poison, and that a very small portion proves immediately fatal. The wood is of no value: if wounded, it plentifully exudes a milky liquor.

<PB N="223" REF="245"/>1532. This is an elegant species of laurel that grows to the height of twenty feet; the flowers small, and of a yellowish color: the fruit pulpy, with an oblong stone.</P>
<P>THIS valuable tree grows in greater quantity in the isle of <HI>Ceylon,</HI> than any other place. It grows wild in the woods, with∣out any culture: every province does not possess it, there is none in that of <HI>Jaffanapatam,</HI> nor <HI>Manaar,</HI> but abound in most of the internal parts, and about <HI>Negumbo</HI> and <HI>Gale.</HI> A pigeon, I think the Pompadour, <HI>Brown's Illustr.</HI> tab. 19, is the species, which, by carrying the fruit to different places, is a great dis∣seminator of this valuable tree. I do not believe it to be pecu∣liar to this island; but the bark is infinitely superior in quality to any other. Botanists enumerate numbers of kinds, but they only vary being taken from trees of different ages, or growing in different soils, and situations. It may be found in <HI>Malabar, Sumatra,</HI> &amp;c. but is depretiated by another name, <HI>Cassia,</HI> and <HI>Canella,</HI> to our unspeakable loss;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CINNAMON, OR CASSIA.</NOTE> <HI>Cinnamomum</HI> was a more dig∣nified name. The antients speak of it under that title, in such high terms, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> wisely retained the name, which gave it greatest respectability. Our countryman, the late <HI>Taylor White,</HI> Esq. in Ph. Trans. vol. l. p. 860, and Mr. <HI>Combes,</HI> resi∣dent in <HI>Sumatra,</HI> in page 873, are entirely of opinion, that <HI>Cin∣namon</HI> and <HI>Cassia</HI> do not specifically differ. Mr. <HI>White</HI>'s account is accompanied with some very good figures of the leaves of the former.</P>
<P>THE celebrated bark is the inner, and is reckoned the most perfect when taken from trees of seven or eight years old, if they grow in a wet slimy soil; but those which grow in the warm white
<PB N="224" REF="246"/>sand of the vallies, come to maturity in five years. <HI>Seba</HI> says, that the ages of the trees are fourteen, fifteen, or sixteen years. It is the heat which gives the bark that quilled form in which it comes over to us, especially the smaller and more delicate sort, which is taken from the smaller branches. The bark is first freed from the external coat, when it is on the trees; is then cut lengthways, stripped off, dried in the sand, and so becomes merchantable.</P>
<P>THE barkers of cinnamon are brought up to the trade, and are called <HI>Chialiases.</HI> The account given by Mr. <HI>Eschelskroon</HI> of the management, is most authentic; from him I shall trans∣cribe what will be highly satisfactory to the readers. At page 339 of <HI>Wolfe</HI>'s account of the isle of <HI>Ceylon,</HI> he begins thus:—
<Q>The time for barking the tree commences in the months of <HI>June</HI> and <HI>July,</HI> and sometimes even in <HI>August:</HI> now as soon as they come out of their villages for that purpose, every dis∣trict sends a detachment of <HI>Dutch</HI> soldiers, and another com∣posed of the natives themselves, called <HI>Lascaryns,</HI> along with them, in order to guard the wood where they are to work, and this partly on account of the roving <HI>Cingalese</HI> moun∣taineers, which sometimes fall on the barked cinnamon, and make it their booty; but still more for the purpose of having an eye upon the <HI>Chialiases</HI> themselves, that they may not be able to conceal any of the cinnamon, and afterwards carry it off.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE bark that is peeled during the day, must be carried every evening to the <HI>Dutch</HI> guard, belonging to their respective dis∣tricts; there cleansed, well dried, and made up into bundles, and afterwards taken in close cases to the factory, where they
<PB N="225" REF="247"/>are weighed, and received by the company as payment of the assessment or tax imposed on these people by government. A man must be a very good hand indeed, that can gather thirty pounds of cinnamon in a day; whence it is easily calculated, how many persons it will take to gather ten or twelve million pounds, and that too of the best; for what is brought in is looked over before it is weighed, and the refuse of it burned.</Q></P>
<P><Q>At the time for gathering this drug, the company are obliged to draw out a <HI>cordon</HI> of seventy-two miles in cir∣cumference; and as there are a great many of these <HI>corps de garde,</HI> it follows that the company must pay a great many <HI>Europeans,</HI> as well as <HI>Cingalese.</HI> These cinnamon barkers are under the command of a captain, called a <HI>Malabadde,</HI> and are distributed into four different classes. All the <HI>Chiliases</HI> must be ready at all times to work at the Governor's command, for on him it depends how much is to be barked and delivered in; and this again depends on the demand for it from <HI>Europe.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THIS important article of luxury was well known to the an∣tients. The <HI>Greeks</HI> called it <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and sometimes <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <HI>Casia Lignea,</HI> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, to the bark, from the pipe∣like form it assumed by the rolling up. We have applied the word <HI>Cassia</HI> to the inferior cinnamons of <HI>Malabar</HI> and <HI>Su∣matra.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Romans</HI> called it <HI>Cinnamomum,</HI> but generally with some addition. The <HI>Xylo-cinnamomum,</HI> or the wood, we are told by <HI>Pliny,</HI> was sold for twenty <HI>denarii,</HI> or twelve shillings and eleven pence <HI>per</HI> pound. The juice, or expressed oil, at one thousand
<PB N="226" REF="248"/><HI>denarii,</HI> or £.32. 5. 10. The <HI>Daphnoides,</HI> or <HI>Isocinnamon,</HI> seems not to be thought the genuine kind, yet sold at the price of three hundred <HI>denarii,</HI> or £.8. 13. 9, the same price as the true <HI>cinnamon.</HI> The <HI>Cinnamomum camocans</HI> was the expressed juice of a nut, and perhaps a different article from the true <HI>cin∣namon,</HI> was sold for no more than forty asses, or two shillings and seven-pence. The antients, according to <HI>Pliny,</HI> esteemed, as we do at present, the cinnamon of the young twigs. It was chiefly made use of as a perfume, either as an ingredient for their unguents, or to rub their bodies with, in form of oil. They appear to have been ignorant of the tree that produced it, as well as the country; they supposed that it came from that part of <HI>Aethiopia</HI> which bordered on the <HI>Troglodytes. Pliny</HI> says they bought all they could of their neighbors; but even Mr. <HI>Bruce,</HI> who would certainly do all the honor he could to <HI>Aethio∣pia,</HI> never mentions it among his botanical enumerations. <HI>Pliny</HI> talks confusedly of a long voyage made with the cargoes of this pretious article, and of the crossing of vast seas: of the cinna∣mon being under the protection of the god <HI>Assabinus,</HI> and of its never being cut without his permission. I dare say that the <HI>Cinnamon</HI> and <HI>Cassia</HI> came then as it does now, from the <HI>Ma∣labar</HI> coast, and <HI>Taprobone</HI> or <HI>Ceylon,</HI> and that the merchants crossing the <HI>Sinus Aethiopicus</HI> in search of it, induced the <HI>Roman</HI> Naturalist to make <HI>Aethiopia</HI> its native country
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pliny, in lib. xii. c. xix. and other parts of his Nat. Hist, treats largely of this tree.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE antients give a most romantic account of these trees, that of their being guarded by a dire species of bat, fighting cruelly with their sharp claws; and by flying serpents; one was
<PB N="227" REF="249"/>the enormous bat of the torrid zone; the others, the winged lizard, before described.</P>
<P>ITS modern use for culinary purposes is unknown to none. <HI>Cinnamon-water</HI> is also a fine <HI>liqueur.</HI> From the leaves is ex∣tracted a thick and fragrant juice, appropriated for the candles of his imperial Majesty of <HI>Ceylon;</HI> and from the roots is ex∣tracted the oil of camphire, and a sort of camphire superior to what we have in the shops, which likewise is reserved for the Emperor, who esteems it an excellent cordial. <HI>Seba,</HI> in Ph.

<P><HI>Pliny,</HI> lib. xxi. c. 21, gives an account of its effects.

<P>THE <HI>Cingalese</HI> style this plant <HI>Bandura,</HI> i. e. <HI>Priapus Vegetabi∣lis;</HI> had Mr. <HI>Folkes</HI> known this, it would have furnished him with new arguments. That singular character drew up the hu∣morous paper with wit, which all its obscenity cannot destroy.

<P>IN <HI>Ceylon</HI> are found two species of the bread-fruit,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BREAD FRUIT.</NOTE> the <HI>Arto∣carpus</HI> of botanists. One, the <HI>Integrifolia, Lin. Suppl.</HI> 412;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE INTEGRI∣FOLIA.</NOTE> the other, the <HI>Incisus,</HI> 411. It is singular, that this blessing to the island should pass so long unnoticed: Yet <HI>Knox,</HI> page 14, in∣formed us of (perhaps) both kinds, certainly of the first, and that above a century ago. The <HI>Integrifolia</HI> he calls by the <HI>Cey∣lonese</HI> name, <HI>Warragah,</HI> which is the species silled with great kernels: see the fruit expressed in different plates, entire and dis∣sected, by M. <HI>Sonnerat,</HI> in his voyage to <HI>New Guinea,</HI> at page 99. These kernels are taken out and boiled by the natives, and often prove preservatives against famine in scarcity of rice. Ex∣teriorly the rind appears prickly, but the spines are soft, and
<PB N="238" REF="261"/>give way to the touch. After the interval of a century, from the time of <HI>Knox,</HI> Doctor <HI>Thunberg</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Travels, iv. p. 255.</NOTE> gives an account of both species. This he says is the <HI>Maldivian sour sack</HI> of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> that it contains two or three hundred great kernels, each four times the size of an almond; and that the fruit grows to the weight of thirty or forty pounds; that the taste is unpleasant, and cadaverous, yet that not fewer than fifteen dishes are pre∣pared from it. He adds, that the trees of both kind are replete with a milky juice, as tenacious as bird-lime itself; and <HI>Knox</HI> adds, that the boys apply it to that purpose. <HI>Rumphius,</HI> i. p. 104, calls the larger variety of this species <HI>Saccus Arboreus major, Nanha,</HI> and gives the figure in tab. xxx. The other he names <HI>Saccus Arboreus minor Tsjampedaka,</HI> see p. 107, tab. xxxi. both these are oblong; the last sack-shaped. The leaves are entire and ovated. The fruit grow in a most singular manner, hanging by the stalk from the body of the tree, <HI>ex arbore trunco prode∣mata,</HI> says <HI>Bauhin,</HI> in his Pinax, p. 511. See also the figure in <HI>Rumphius,</HI> and also in <HI>Linschotten,</HI> tab. 76, 77.</P>
<P>THIS species grows in most of the same places with the follow∣ing.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PLACES.</NOTE> It is also frequent in the <HI>Maldive</HI> isles, from whence, in about the year 1727, or 1728, some roots were brought, and planted in this island. From this circumstance the species is called <HI>Maldivische Syr Sack.</HI></P>
<P>DOCTOR <HI>Thunberg,</HI> in our Phil. Trans. vol. lxix. has published a long account of these fruits, under the name of <HI>Tsitodium,</HI> and particularly distinguished the second kind by the name of <HI>Macrocarpon,</HI> or <HI>long fruit.</HI> Both kinds have various names:

<Q><L>A BOUGH of fairest fruit, that downy smil'd,</L>
<L>New gather'd, and ambrosial smell dissus'd.</L></Q>
<PB N="243" REF="266"/>Moderns do not speak in raptures of the fruit. Sir <HI>Joseph Banks</HI> gives the most favorable account, that they all have a pleasant vinous taste. Three species merit that praise; the others must be dressed by frying or boiling, and so eaten as bread. But the form of the plant is the most grotesque in na∣ture, and most rich when loaden, as it is, with its splendid look∣ing fruit. The stem grows to the height of ten or twelve feet, and to the thickness of a man's leg, yet can readily be cut through with a knife; neither does it live above two years. It cannot rise to the dignity of a tree: Its leaves are the largest of any known vegetable; some are more than twelve feet long, and two broad; are very smooth, of an elegant green above, and yellow beneath; they more resemble paper than a leaf, and give a most rustling sound. The fruit grows in vast clusters, and is of an oblong shape, and is filled with a pulp soft as butter. Doctor <HI>Trew,</HI> by the skilful hand of <HI>Ehret,</HI> gives of it the most comprehensive idea.</P>
<P>THIS fine plant was not overlooked by the antients.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PALA PLINII.</NOTE> <HI>Pliny</HI> certainly means this species by his <HI>Pala,</HI> which he describes in these words, lib. xii. c. 6,—<Q>Major alia pomo et suavitate prae∣cellentior, quo sapientes <HI>Indorum</HI> vivunt. Folium alas avium imitatur longitudine trium cubitorum, latitudine duûm. Fructum cortice emittit, admirabilem succi dulcedine, ut uno quaternos satiet. Arbori nomen palae, pomo arienae.</Q></P>
<P>THIS account agrees well, not only in the size of the leaves and fruit, and delicacy of the pulp, but it also gives us reason to suppose, that there had been some tradition delivered down to
<PB N="244" REF="267"/>the <HI>Indians</HI> of its having been the <HI>Paradisiacal</HI> tree, and that it continued the food of the wise men, or the <HI>Brahmins,</HI> as if it was supposed to still have the power of imparting wisdom to those who fed on its fruits. <HI>Linnaeus</HI> gives the name of MUSA <HI>sapientum, Trew's Ehret,</HI> tab. 21, 22, 23, to another species, with a shorter fruit.

This is also a very singular kind; the body rude to the highest degree, as if formed of the accretion of many trunks, angular, and in many places cavernous. The branches spread out most extensively on the sides, grow across, interwoven with each other, and often

<P>THIS tree has been venerated in <HI>India</HI> from the earliest times. The god <HI>Rum,</HI> charmed with its grotesque appearance, directed that worship should be paid to it. The superstition has been retained to this day. It is called the <HI>Pagod tree,</HI> and <HI>tree of councils:</HI> the first from the idols placed under its shade; the second, because meetings were held under its cool branches. In some places it is believed to be the haunt of spectres, as the antient spreading oaks of <HI>Wales</HI> have been of fairies: In others are erected, beneath the shade, pillars of stones, or posts, ele∣gantly carved, and ornamented with the most beautiful porcel∣lane, to supply the use of mirrors.

<P><HI>Flabelliformis, Rumph. Amboin.</HI> i. tab. 10.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BORASSUS.</NOTE> The leaves are large and palmated, the edges of the stalks serrated; the leaves are four feet long, divided into seventy or eighty rays, like the sticks of a fan, and may be folded up in the same manner. In <HI>Macassar</HI> they are made into <HI>umbrellas,</HI> but are so highly esteemed there, that they are carried by none but by a few per∣sons of the first rank. The fruit grows in clusters, and each is about the size of a child's head. Within is a very eatable pulp,
<PB N="248" REF="271"/>and besides are three lesser nuts, of the size of a goose's egg containing when young a soft kernel, when old, a very palatable liquor. A bread, or cake is made from the kernel, which re∣quires a considerable preparation: and a liquor greatly in use called <HI>Sura,</HI> is extracted from the body, with the usual process of tapping the tree. From that again is got, by boiling, a rich syrup, and a sort of sugar. The timber is elegantly veined, and striated, and often made into chests.</P>
<P>THE ascent to the summit of the tree is performed by a man, who attains the height by the assistance of a girdle, which sur∣rounds his waist and the tree; his knees are fixed against the body, and he gains the height by alternately removing the gir∣dle, which supports his body, and then with his knees gaining a new advance: A most dangerous operation; for should the girdle break, his life is lost.</P>

<P>THE beautiful CORYPHA <HI>Umbraculisera,</HI>

They are about three feet and a half in diameter, and are the finest umbrellas in nature, and in univer∣sal use in <HI>Ceylon,</HI> to protect against the rays of the sun, or the fury of the rains. <HI>Knox,</HI> at page 14, shews the <HI>Ceylonese</HI> man under the protection of one of the leaves. They also serve for paper for the lapping of parcels. The wood is hard, and veined with yellow, and serves to make chests, like the preced∣ing. The fruit is in the form of a cannon ball, containing within two other nuts, of the size of a musquet ball, which are eaten by the poor. These are of the richest saffron color, and give a most brilliant appearance to this elegant tree, and hang down in clusters three feet long.</P>

<P>I AM so much indebted to my late worthy friend <HI>John Gideon Loten,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">JOHN GIDEON LOTEN.</NOTE> Esq. for my acquaintance with the zoology of <HI>Ceylon,</HI> and various particulars respecting its natural history, that it would be ungrateful in me not to pay the full tribute of praise to his memory. I became acquainted with him a few years after his arrival in <HI>England,</HI> in 1758, and long enjoyed the valuable friendship of a man of the strictest honor, integrity, liberality, simplicity, and gentleness of manners. He was by birth a <HI>Dutchman,</HI> a native of <HI>Utrecht.</HI> He went to <HI>India</HI> in the year 1732, where he exercised several of the highest offices at <HI>Batavia,</HI> and in the islands of <HI>Ceylon</HI> and <HI>Celebes,</HI> with the highest credit, he alleviating the cares of his important duties with the fullest cultivation of the liberal arts. At <HI>Colombo</HI> he established a botanical garden; and in every place made the pleasing study of natural history a principal object. He brought over with him a large collection of drawings, done with equal neatness and accuracy, some by the natives, others by <HI>Euro∣peans</HI> whom he found in the country. I was indebted to his friendship for copies of several; but the greater part he at my request liberally communicated to <HI>Peter Brown,</HI> an ingenious artist, a <HI>Dane</HI> by birth, who engraved not fewer than twenty∣one, and, with several others from different places, published a
<PB N="251" REF="274"/>splendid work in 1776, with the title of 'NEW ILLUSTRATIONS OF ZOOLOGY,' under the patronage of my late worthy friend <HI>Marmaduke Tunstal,</HI> Esq. and myself.</P>
<P>FROM the same collection was formed my INDIAN ZOOLOGY, begun in 1769, and left a fragment. It was resumed and pub∣lished more complete in one volume quarto, in 1790. I refer the reader to the preface to that work for an account of its rise and progress.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Loten</HI> returned into <HI>Europe</HI> in 1758, and coming into <HI>England,</HI> where he lived several years, in 1765 he married his second wife, <HI>Laetitia Cotes,</HI> of the respectable house of <HI>Cotes,</HI> in <HI>Shropshire,</HI> several years after which he returned into <HI>Hol∣land,</HI> and died at <HI>Utrecht,</HI> on <HI>February</HI> 25, 1789, aged eighty, and was interred in St. <HI>Jacob</HI>'s church in that city. During the whole of my acquaintance with him, at frequent periods he endured the most severe spasmodic complaints in his chest, which for months together disabled him from the use of a bed. I should not have mentioned these circumstances, was it not to add to his other virtues, those of unfeigned piety, and resig∣nation unexampled amidst the trial of severest misery.</P>
<P>IN the north aisle, westward of <HI>Westminster</HI> Abby, is a most magnificent cenotaph, erected in 1795, to perpetuate the me∣mory of this excellent man, the performance of THOMAS BANKS.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE APE-GOD, HANNAMAN.</NOTE> a deity partaking of the form of that race, with the addition of heads of bears, who rendered the god <HI>Vitchenou</HI> great services in this very isle, slaying giants, and performing so many wondrous deeds. In vol. iii. p. 863, of <HI>Churchill</HI>'s collection, is a long detail of his exploits. There is a wonderful extravagance in the <HI>Indian</HI> mythology; the warmth
<PB N="253" REF="276"/>of their climate creates ideas filled with the strangest imagery. The tooth was probably worshipped as one belonging to his godship.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">TRINCOMALE.</NOTE> <HI>Trincomale</HI> harbour is in Lat. 8° 30″, a fine and secure port, protected by a strong garrison, consisting of about four hundred men.

<P>ON <HI>September</HI> 2d, the former came off <HI>Trincomale,</HI> and to his great surprise found the <HI>French</HI> colors flying on all the forts, <HI>Suffrein,</HI> with a superior squadron, sailed out of the harbour, secure, as he thought, of victory. Our brave admiral, and his officers, enraged at the loss of the place, eagerly accepted the offer of combat. The contending admirals displayed every proof of courage and skill. <HI>Suffrein</HI>'s ship was reduced to a wreck, and he obliged to remove his flag to another. By some neglect of ours we lost the disabled ship. Night alone terminated the battle. <HI>Suffrein</HI> retired into <HI>Trincomale,</HI> crowding in without order. Thus secured, <HI>Hughes</HI> left him reluctantly, and sailed for <HI>Madras</HI> with his shattered squadron. Our loss was inconsi∣derable, in common men, for it did not exceed fifty-one killed
<PB N="254" REF="277"/>and three hundred wounded. In officers we suffered severely. The captains <HI>Lumley, Watt,</HI> and <HI>Wood</HI> fell in the action. The loss of the <HI>French</HI> was enormous. Four hundred and twelve men were killed, and six hundred and seventy-six were wound∣ed. The carnage on board the gallant <HI>Suffrein</HI>'s ship, the <HI>Hero,</HI> was unheard in any fight of any age, it was an unparalleled car∣nage. Many of the <HI>French</HI> captains had behaved ill, six were broke, and sent prisoners to the island of <HI>Mauritius;</HI> and thus ended the unavailing slaughters in the <HI>Indian</HI> seas.</P>

<HEAD>THE LIFE OF SIR WILLIAM JAMES, BARONET;</HEAD>
<BYLINE>COMMUNICATED BY LADY JAMES.</BYLINE>
<P>SIR WILLIAM JAMES embarked in a sea life at twelve years of age. He was more than twenty years at sea before he got the command of a ship. He was with Sir <HI>Edward Hawke</HI> in the <HI>West Indies,</HI> in 1738, as a junior officer. Some years after, he commanded a ship in the <HI>Virginia</HI> trade; in her he was taken by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> in the Gulph of <HI>Florida,</HI> and carried a pri∣soner to the <HI>Havannah.</HI> His sufferings after his captivity will be related hereaster:—In the beginning of 1747, he went to the <HI>East Indies</HI> as chief officer of one of the <HI>East India</HI> Com∣pany's ships, and performed two voyages in that station. In 1749, the <HI>East India</HI> Company appointed him to the command of a new ship called the <HI>Guardian,</HI> equipped as a ship of war; in her he sailed to <HI>Bombay,</HI> to protect the trade on the <HI>Malabar</HI> coast, which was much annoyed by the depredations of <HI>Angria,</HI> and other pirates, with which those seas swarmed.</P>
<P>DURING two years he was constantly employed in convoying the merchant ships from <HI>Bombay</HI> and <HI>Surat,</HI> to the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> the Gulph of <HI>Persia,</HI> and up and down the <HI>Malabar</HI> coast, from the Gulph of <HI>Cambay</HI> to Cape <HI>Comorin.</HI> He was frequently attacked on this service by the different piratical states. At one time, when he had near seventy sail of ships and vessels under his charge, he was assailed by a large fleet of <HI>Angria</HI>'s frigates and
<PB N="258" REF="281"/>gallivats, full of men. With the <HI>Guardian, Bombay</HI> grab, and <HI>Drake</HI> bomb ketch, he engaged the enemy, and kept them in close action, whilst his fleet got safe into <HI>Tellicherry.</HI> In this conflict he sunk one of the enemies largest gallivats, and ob∣liged the rest to seek for safety in <HI>Gheriah</HI> and <HI>Severndroog.</HI></P>
<P>ABOUT the beginning of the year 1751, Sir <HI>William</HI> was ap∣pointed commander in chief of the <HI>East India</HI> Company's ma∣rine forces, and hoisted his broad pendant on board the <HI>Pro∣tector,</HI> a sine ship of 44 guns. On <HI>April</HI> 2d, 1755, he was sent with the <HI>Protector, Guardian, Bombay</HI> grab, and <HI>Drake</HI> bomb, with some gallivats, to attempt such of the ports belonging to <HI>Angria</HI> which lie to the northward of <HI>Gheriah,</HI> his principal fortress, and capital.</P>
<P>THE chief of these fortresses was <HI>Severndroog,</HI> where <HI>Angria</HI>'s vessels refitted, and took shelter when they could not reach <HI>Ghe∣riah.</HI> It was well defended by batteries along the shore, and the entrance of the harbour was secured by a strong castle, on which were mounted seventy pieces of cannon. <HI>Angria</HI>'s people con∣sidered <HI>Severndroog</HI> as their strongest hold next to <HI>Gheriah.</HI> Sir <HI>William,</HI> having reconnoitred the place, and informed himself of its strength, brought his ships with a leading wind close to the castle-walls, and by a steady well-directed fire (whilst the <HI>Drake</HI> threw in her bombs) soon brought on a parley, and in less than three hours the governor surrendered the castle, and the vessels in the harbour; from hence Sir <HI>William</HI> went to <HI>Fort Victoria,</HI> which quickly followed the fate of <HI>Severndroog;</HI> and the next day four other forts were numbered in his con∣quests: all these falling, was a severe blow to <HI>Angria,</HI> who
<PB N="259" REF="282"/>had a short time before attacked a fleet of <HI>Dutch</HI> ships, under the protection of a 50 gun ship and a frigate: The <HI>Dutch</HI> fleet was dispersed, and the 50 gun ship, and some of the merchant∣men, were brought in great triumph to <HI>Gheriah.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN Sir <HI>William</HI> returned with his victorious fleet to <HI>Bom∣bay,</HI> he found Admiral <HI>Watson</HI> there, with three line-of-battle ships, and some frigates, &amp;c. The government of <HI>Bombay</HI> con∣sulted with the Admiral about means to destroy the powers of <HI>Angria,</HI> and the <HI>Mahratta</HI> states joined in the confederacy, for they had suffered by his depredations.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>William</HI> was sent with his little squadron to reconnoitre <HI>Gheriah,</HI> a place represented to be almost impregnable from the sea. He judiciously stood close in to the walls, under the cover of night, and with his boat sounded and examined the channels leading to the harbour, and outer road; in the day-time he stood in within gun-shot of the walls; and having in two days made himself perfectly master of the enemy's strength, he re∣turned to <HI>Bombay.</HI> This piece of service he performed with so much promptness and skill, that he received the thanks of the Governor and Admiral; and they were so well persuaded, from his report, of the practicability of the enterprize, that no time was lost in equipping the ships, and embarking the troops.</P>
<P>THE squadron formed off <HI>Gheriah</HI> the 10th <HI>February,</HI> 1756. Sir <HI>William,</HI> in the <HI>Protector,</HI> led the squadron to the attack in one division, whilst another division of frigates led the bomb∣ketches in another line; a heavy and tremendous sire began on our part from the ships of the line, whilst the shells were thrown with great success from the bombs into the harbour, where all <HI>Angria</HI>'s ships were hawled for safety; these were soon set on
<PB N="260" REF="283"/>fire by the bombs; the fire from the castle and batteries soon slackened, and before the evening set in, the castle surrendered, and <HI>Gheriah,</HI> and all its dependencies, fell into our hands. Thus shortly ended an enterprize, which, for many years, had been in contemplation by the <HI>European</HI> governments in <HI>India,</HI> but which was never before attempted, from an idea that no force sufficient could be brought against the walls of this castle. Lord <HI>Clive,</HI> at this time a lieutenant-colonel, commanded the land forces.</P>
<P>ON the <HI>Malabar</HI> coast, soon after this, he fell in with a <HI>French</HI> ship from <HI>Mauritius,</HI> very much his superior in men and guns; she was called <HI>l'Indienne:</HI> after a smart action she struck, and Sir <HI>William</HI> carried her in triumph to <HI>Bombay.</HI></P>
<P>SIR <HI>William James,</HI> in an eminent manner, displayed his nautical abilities, by shewing, that in despight of a contrary monsoon, a communication between <HI>Bombay</HI> and the <HI>Coro∣mandel</HI> coast may be effected in cases of exigency
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The tracks are laid down in Mr. Arrowsinith's map of the world.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS passage was attempted by Sir <HI>William</HI> in the first in∣stance, and he accomplished it in nearly as short a time as it usually was done in the favorable monsoon. It was of the ut∣most moment that he succeeded at the time he did, for by it, he consirmed to Admiral <HI>Watson</HI> (then in the <HI>Ganges)</HI> the intelli∣gence of the war with <HI>France,</HI> and brought to his assistance 500 troops, by which the Admiral and Colonel <HI>Clive</HI> were ena∣bled, in <HI>March</HI> 1757, to take <HI>Chandenagore,</HI> the chief of the <HI>French</HI> settlements in <HI>Bengal.</HI></P>
<P>IN effecting this passage, the commodore crossed the equator
<PB N="261" REF="284"/>in the meridian of <HI>Bombay,</HI> and continued his course to the southward as far as the tenth degree, and then was enabled to go as far to the eastward as the meridian of <HI>Atcheen</HI> head, the N. W. extremity of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> from whence, with the N. E. monsoon, which then prevaled in the bay of <HI>Bengal,</HI> he could with ease gain the entrance of the <HI>Ganges,</HI> or any port on the <HI>Coromandel</HI> coast.</P>
<P>IN the beginning of this narrative it was mentioned, Sir <HI>Wil∣liam</HI> had suffered shipwreck. The uncommon hardships he and his people encountered were as follows:—After they were released from the <HI>Spanish</HI> prison at the <HI>Havannah,</HI> they em∣barked in a small brig for <HI>Carolina.</HI> The crew of the brig, and Sir <HI>William</HI> and his people, amounted to fifteen. The second day after putting to sea, a very hard gale of wind came on; the vessel strained, and soon became so leaky, that the pumps and the people bailing could not keep her free; and at length, be∣ing worn out with labor, seven of them, with Sir <HI>William,</HI> got into the only boat they had, with a small bag of biscuit and a keg of water; the vessel soon after disappeared, and went down. They were twenty days in this boat without a compass; their biscuit soon got wet with the sea, which for two days made a breach over the boat; a snuff-box Sir <HI>William</HI> had with him served to distribute their daily allowance of water; and after encountering every difficulty of famine and severe labor, on the twentieth day they found themselves on the island of <HI>Cuba,</HI> not ten miles from whence they had been embarked out of a <HI>Spanish</HI> prison: but a prison had no horrors to them. The <HI>Spa∣niards</HI> received them once more into captivity; and it is remark∣able,
<PB N="262" REF="285"/>that only one out of the seven perished, though after they got on shore, but few of them had the use of their limbs for many days.</P>
<P>IN the year 1759, Sir <HI>William</HI> returned to his native country. The <HI>East India</HI> Company presented him with a handsome ele∣gant gold-hilted sword, with a complimentary motto, expressive of their sense of his gallant services. Soon afterwards he was chosen a director, and continued a member of that respectable body more than twenty years; in which time he had filled both the chairs. He was fifteen years deputy master of the corpora∣tion of <HI>Trinity House;</HI> a governor of <HI>Greenwich</HI> hospital; served two sessions in parliament for <HI>West Looe;</HI> and on the 25th of <HI>July</HI> 1778, the King was pleased to create him a baronet.</P>
<P>He planned the reduction of <HI>Pondicherry</HI> during the <HI>Ame∣rican</HI> war, and received a rich service of plate from the <HI>India</HI> Company, as a testimony of their sense of his skill and judg∣ment in that affair.</P>
<P>ON the 16th <HI>December,</HI> 1783, Sir <HI>William</HI> died, aged 62. In the year following, a handsome building was erected on his estate in <HI>Kent,</HI> near the top of <HI>Shooter's Hill;</HI> it is built in the style of a castle, with three sides, and commands a most extensive view. The lowest room is adorned with weapons peculiar to the dif∣ferent countries of the East. The room above has different views of naval actions and enterprizes painted on the ceiling, in which Sir <HI>William</HI> had been a considerable actor. The top of the build∣ing is finished with battlements about sixty feet from the base. The top of the battlements are four hundred and eighty feet above the level of <HI>Shooter's Hill,</HI> and more than a hundred and
<PB N="263" REF="286"/>forty feet higher than the top of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s cupola.—On a tablet over the entrance door is this inscription:
<Q><L>This Building was erected M.DCC.LXXXIV.</L>
<L>by the Representative of the late</L>
<L>Sir WILLIAM JAMES, Bart.</L>
<L>to commemorate that gallant Officer's Atchievements in the <HI>East Indies,</HI></L>
<L>during his Command of the Company's Marine Forces in those Seas;</L>
<L>and in a particular Manner to record the Conquest of</L>
<L>the Castle of <HI>Severndroog,</HI> on the Coast of <HI>Malabar,</HI></L>
<L>which fell to his superior Valour and able Conduct</L>
<L>on the 2d Day of <HI>April</HI> M.DCC.LV.</L></Q></P>
<P>OF Sir <HI>William,</HI> it is said, by a person who knew him inti∣mately near thirty years, and was well acquainted with his pro∣fessional abilities; That as a thorough practical seaman, he was almost without an equal:—As an officer, he was brave, vigilant, prompt, and resolute; patient in difficulty, with a pre∣sence of mind that seemed to grow from danger.</P>
