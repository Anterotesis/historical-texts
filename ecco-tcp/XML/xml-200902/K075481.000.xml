<P>THE London Adviser and Guide: CONTAINING Every INSTRUCTION and INFORMATION useful and necessary to Persons LIVING IN LONDON, AND COMING TO RESIDE THERE; In order to enable them to enjoy Security and Tran∣quillity, and conduct their Domestic Affairs with Prudence and Economy.</P>
<P>TOGETHER WITH AN ABSTRACT Of all those LAWS which regard their Protection against the Frauds, Impositions, Insults and Acci∣dents to which they are there liable.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG all the useful and instructive Books written for the multitude, there has been none calculated to give that ne∣cessary information to Strangers coming to reside in London, which they are always in want of, nor any pointing out those easy and salutary remedies which the inhabitants of the metropolis may have recourse to, to protect them from the arts and villainies of those who prey upon the ignorant and incautious. Impressed with the idea of the utility of such a work, the author of the subsequent pages has given them to the world, and flatters himself he has omitted nothing neces∣sary to be known, to secure the individual in tranquillity and the peaceable enjoyment of his home, and put him in a me∣thod of conducting his domestic concerns with wisdom and oeconomy.</P>
<P>If the reader is desirous of hauing a Compendium of all the laws that respect, him as a domestic man, a gentleman, and a member of society, and lead him to avoid the penalties he is liable to, I will refer him to a work lately published, called <HI>THE COUNTRY LAWYER,</HI> where he will find every subject in which he has any interest fully treated of, and on the best authorities: the particulars of this work he will find in an advertisement at the end.</P>

<HEAD>THE LONDON ADVISER.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>HOUSES.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. HOUSES and lodgings in London are let either furnished or unfurnished, and their prices are according to their size, their situation, and their man∣ner of fitting up. In the central parts of London and Westminster, such as the neighbourhood of St. James's, Charing-Cross, the squares, Covent-Garden, the thea∣tres, St. Paul's Church-yard, Cheapside, the Royal Ex∣change, &amp;c. they are high rented; in more distant parts they are cheaper, and in by-streets, courts, lanes, alleys, and such obscure places, cheaper still.</P>
<P>A private house 24 feet in front, and about seventy deep, two or three rooms on a floor, unfurnished, in the best streets, will let from 100 guineas a-year to 150; such a house, in other places, may be had from 80 to 100 guineas: unfurnished lodgings in such houses are seldom to be met with.</P>
<P>In less central places, but in good streets, unfurnish∣ed houses of twenty feet in front, two rooms and a light closet on a floor, may be had for sixty or seventy guineas a-year; and houses of eighteen feet in front for forty or thirty guineas, according to the situation and conveniencies. Unfurnished lodgings in such houses let proportionably. The first floor generally goes at half the net rent of the house without taxes; the parlour floor, or second floor, at one fourth.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="2" REF="22"/>2. Houses about twenty-one feet in front will let from four guineas a week furnished to eight guineas, according to the season of the year and the time they are engaged for. The dearest season is from Christmas to June, when families are in town and the parliament sitting; the cheapest, when families are out of town, and the parliament prorogued. In the winter season, such a house as I have mentioned, taken for four or five months, may possibly be had for seven guineas a-week. Thus taken, the tenant pays no taxes, the goods are delivered on inventory, and whatever is destroyed is paid for. Furnished lodgings, that is, the first floor with a servant's room, &amp;c. in such a house, will let for from two guineas a-week to three and a half, in pro∣portion to the goodness of the furniture, the conveni∣encies wanted, the trouble given, the time they are engaged for, and the season of the year.</P>
<P>Houses of fifty guineas a-year rent will let furnished for from two guineas weekly to five, and the first floor furnished will let for, from one guinea a week to two guineas; second floors two thirds of the rent of first floors, and parlour floors at the price of second floors.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is generally estimated, that in lodging-houses the rent of the first floor furnished, with other conve∣niencies, such as kitchen, cellars, garret, &amp;c. shall pay the rent and taxes of the whole house unfurnished.</P>
<P N="4">4. Shops, when let separate, will fetch from 20 l. a-year to 60 l. free of taxes, according to their size, situ∣ation, trade of the street, and shew of window.</P>
<P N="5">5. Landlords have now got into a method of making tenants pay guineas for rent instead of pounds, and also land-tax and repairs; but all these outgoings should be considered when the agreement is made, as well as the taxes on the house, for in some parishes the poor-rates and land-tax are lower than in others. Persons who have money may often get the remnant of a lease cheap, provided they will pay down a certain sum of money for such lease; for there are always distressed house-keepers in London, trying to procure money by every possible means; for which reason, such as pur∣chase a lease should examine the covenants of that lease, and the state of the building, and particularly take care
<PB N="3" REF="23"/>
that the rent and taxes are paid up to the time they take possession of it, and also the ground-rent, by see∣ing the receipts; otherwise the tenant may have the arrears of such rent or taxes to pay, and the seller of the lease may not be found, or, if found, not able to repay.</P>
<P N="6">6. The general conditions of a lease are, to leave such fixtures at the end of the term as are given in with the lease on schedule, and to leave it in such a state as it was in when taken, the wear from time only excepted; to pay the rent half-yearly, under a forfei∣ture of the lease, but with a liberty of assigning it dur∣ing the term.</P>
<P N="7">7. If a tenant purchases or takes a lease of another tenant, during its term, by assignment, he is no longer bound for the rent than whilst it is in his possession; he may assign it to another, and, this done, is no longer answerable for the rent; but the first tenant, assigning it without the consent of his landlord, is held bound for the rent during the whole term, if the occupier does not pay it.</P>

<P><HI>Note, F. S.</HI> or the Fee Simple, is the Perpetuity.</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="5" REF="25"/>9. In purchasing a lease of a tenant, it is often ex∣pected that the purchaser should also buy the fixtures at a fair appraisement; in doing this, he should exa∣mine the lease, and see that he does not give money for those fixtures which belong to the house; for land∣lords will often fit up a house with every necessary fix∣ture, and put the tenant to no expence in this matter. But if the fixtures have been put up by the tenant, he has a liberty to remove or sell all such as are not fixed to the freehold.</P>
<P>Fixtures removeable are locks, bells, cisterns, grates fixed, coppers, dressers, shelves, counters, &amp;c. Paper pasted to the wall, buildings erected, new windows, chimney-pieces, &amp;c. or things to beautify the house, &amp;c. and fixed to the freehold, must go with the house, at the end of the term, and cannot be removed.</P>
<P>When goods or fixtures are appraised, the seller and the buyer each appoints one appraiser, and the price is fixed between them; if they cannot agree, a third is called in by the other two, and his decision is final.— If six or eight hours is taken up in this business, each appraiser expects a guinea for his trouble; if a few fix∣tures only are to be appraised, the appraiser will expect only half-a-guinea. However, if you employ him in removing your furniture, repairing it, &amp;c. and you make a prior agreement with him, he will probably not charge you for the appraising of a few fixtures. Be careful to have an honest man for an appraiser, for his voice has been known to have been bought over on the other side. When goods are appraised to a buyer, a greater value is put upon them than they would fetch at a sale; and if immediately sold, they would not fetch the appraised price by thirty per∣cent.</P>
<P N="10">10. In taking a house of its owner, take care that it is in thorough repair, and give a rent accordingly.</P>
<P N="11">11. It is very dangerous to take unfurnished lodg∣ings in London; for should the tenant of the house not pay his rent, your goods will be liable to be seized for it; so will your carriage and horses standing at livery, for the rent of the stables, if that rent is in arrear.— To avoid this, enquire into the circumstances of the
<PB N="6" REF="26"/>
house-keeper, and if you cannot get the landlord of the house to give you an agreement in writing, that he will not seize your goods for any arrears that may become due by his tenant, ask to see the landlord's receipt for the last half-year, before you pay your own rent.</P>
<P N="12">12. Such house-keepers who have troublesome lodg∣ers, may remove them, if they will not quit otherwise, by raising the rent weekly upon them; and if they re∣fuse to pay, suing them for the same; if the lodgings are furnished, and they do not pay, an opportunity may be taken, when the lodger and all persons be∣longing to him are out of the apartments, to lock the door, and keep him from re-entering; if any thing is owing, any effects of the lodger may be detained.</P>
<P N="13">13. If a tenant of an unfurnished house gives notice to his landlord to quit, and does not quit at the time given in such notice; or if he will not quit the pre∣mises on a legal notice from his landlord, but holds possession beyond his term, if the landlord has ac∣quainted him in writing that he expects double rent for his so doing, he is obliged to pay double the rent first agreed on. 11 Geo. 2. c. 19. s. 18. 4 Geo. 2. c. 28. s. 1.</P>
<P>If a tenant cannot be removed by any of these means, he must be ejected out by a course of law.</P>
<P>Notice of warning must be in writing, directed to the tenant.</P>
<P N="14">14. It is a late determination of the courts, that if it be necessary to give a tenant at will half-a-year's notice to quit, the said notice must be given half-a-year be∣fore the expiration of his year; that is to say, his year and the notice must expire at the same time; for if the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enant enters upon another year, he may keep posses∣sion the whole of that year, and no ejectment to put him out before will stand good.</P>
<P N="15">15. For every dwelling-house inhabited, rented from 5 l. to 20 l. the occupier must pay 6 d. in the pound, 18 Geo. 3. c. 26.19 Geo. 3. c. 59.</P>
<P>At 20 l. and upwards to any sum under 40 l. 9 d. in the pound. Ibid.</P>
<P>All at 40 l. and upwards, 1 s. in the pound. Ibid.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="27"/>The offices, yards, gardens, coach-houses, brew-houses, wood-houses, wash-houses, &amp;c. provided they all stand within the compass of one acre, belonging to the dwelling-house, must be valued with the dwelling-house, and shall be charged with the same duties. Ibid</P>
<P>Shops and warehouses, if attached to the dwelling-houses, shall also be liable to be reckoned in with the rent, except the warehouses of wharfingers. Ibid.</P>
<P>But no warehouse that is a distinct building shall be liable. Ibid.</P>
<P>No house shall be deemed inhabited, where only one person is lest in charge of it. Ibid.</P>

<HEAD>INSURANCE-OFFICES FROM FIRE.</HEAD>
<P N="20">20. When your house is furnished, the next pre∣caution to be taken is, to insure it from fire: this may be done at several public insurance-offices, and at a very small annual premium. The landlord generally insures the building.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Sun-Fire Office,</HI> near the Royal Exchange, and in Craig's-court, Charing-cross, has been esteemed the most eligible, because the proprietors act liberally to the insur∣ed, and pay the amount of any loss with little trouble to the supplicant. They expect you to give in the best estimate you can of the loss sustained, swear to the amount, and then they immediately pay; they used to deduct three per cent. on the payment, but have lately altered their plan, and pay now the full sum insured, if the goods lost amount to that sum. The clerks ex∣pect some small fees to the amount of a few guineas.</P>
<P>The Sun-Fire Office, besides 7 s. 6d. for the policy and mark, has the following annual premiums:—

<P>No loss or damage happening to plate will be paid, unless it be expressly mentioned to be assured, and in adjusting losses thereon, the same shall not be valued at more than 6 s. per ounce; and in adjusting losses on houses, no wainscot, sculpture or carved work shall be valued at more than 3s. per yard.</P>
<P>This Office allows all reasonable charges attending the removal of goods in case of fire, and pays the loss of the assured, if the goods shall be destroyed, lost, or damaged by such removal, without any deduction.</P>

<P>Common Insurances are in houses built on all sides with brick or stone, and covered with state, tiles or lead, and in which no hazardous trades are carried on.</P>
<P>Hazardous insurances are goods, not usually deemed hazardous, in timber or plaster buildings; and hazar∣dous goods or trades, such as pitch, tar, tallow, hemp, slax, rosin, &amp;c. apothecaries, coopers, bread or bis∣cuit bakers, ship and tallow chandlers, sail and rope-makers, colourmen, inn-holders, &amp;c. in brick or stone buildings.</P>
<P>Double-hazardous insurances are, hazardous goods and trades, in timber or plaster buildings: and also
<PB N="14" REF="34"/>
chemists, ship-carpenters, boat-builders, china, glass and earthen ware, hay and straw, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Particular cases, and other insurances more hazar∣dous still, are subject to the orders and discretion of the directors.</P>
<P>The insurance takes place from the time the charge is paid, and the deed subscribed by the insurer. If any alteration is made on the premises where the goods, &amp;c. are insured, notice must be given at the office, and such alteration approved by the directors, or the poli∣cy is void.</P>
<P>The deposit-money is returned on the expiration of the policy; that is, at the end of the seven years, with a proportionable dividend of profits (after deduction of losses and incidental charges only).</P>
<P>Every member or insurer shall pay a due proportion of all losses and charges; and if such proportion shall at any time, beyond the deposit-money, be more than equal to the sum at first deposited, then any member or insurer, who by insurance becomes a member, shall be at liberty to quit the society, paying his proportion due at that time.</P>
<P>Any member may transfer his policy; and the exe∣cutors or administrators of every member dying, shall, within three months, give notice at the office, and have such transfer or draft indorsed upon his policy, in which case, the assignee, executor, or administrator, shall be entitled to the same benefit the original insurer was; that is, if the directors think proper: if not, they shall only have the proportionable profits up to the time of transfer or death.</P>
<P>Members may attend general meetings, which are held twice a year, and may at any time see the orders and proceedings of the directions, books of accounts, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="5">5. The <HI>Westminster Fire-Office,</HI> Bedford-street, Co∣vent-garden, insures houses only, and on the following terms:—</P>
<P>Every person insuring for one year shall pay for such insurance, for every hundred pounds. two shillings for brick, and four shillings for timber buildings, exclu∣sive of all present and future Parliamentary impositi∣ons,
<PB N="15" REF="35"/>
provided the premises are situate within ten miles from the office.</P>
<P>Persons insuring for seven years become proprietors of the office; and in consideration of their payment for the whole term in advance, will be allowed one year's insurance in seven. They are to pay a pre∣mium at the rate of two shillings per cent. and a depo∣sit of ten shillings per cent. on brick, and double those sums on timber buildings within five miles from the office.</P>
<P>All septennial insurers shall contribute to making good the losses in proportion to their insurance; but none to be charged above ten shillings per cent. for brick, and double for timber houses, &amp;c. which if any loss shall ever require, any member, first paying his said share, and remitting the deposit-money, may sur∣render his policy, and be discharged.</P>
<P>The deposit-money to be returned to every insurer at the expiration of his policy, together with the yearly dividends of profit, except what shall be necessary to defray incident charges and losses by fire, which shall be first deducted out of the same.</P>
<P>Houses and buildings having the fronts and back fronts built with brick or stone, and having also suffi∣cient brick party-walls, are to be deemed brick; and others not so built, to be deemed timber.</P>
<P>All buildings insured to be viewed by the surveyor of the office, who is to determine their quality, whe∣ther brick or timber.</P>

<P>Assurances on jewels, plate, medals, watches, prints not in trade, pictures, drawings, and statuary-work; also assurances to chemists, distillers, and sugar-refiners; or any other assurances more than ordinarily hazardous, by reason of the trade, nature of the goods, narrowness of the place, or other dangerous circumstances, must be particularly specified, and may be made by special agreement.</P>
<P>Any number of dwelling-houses, and the out-houses thereunto belonging, together with the goods therein, may be assured in one policy, provided the sum to be assured on each is particularly mentioned.</P>
<P>Assurances on buildings and goods are deemed dis∣tinct and separate adventures, so that the premium on goods is not advanced by reason of any assurance on the building wherein the goods are kept, nor the pre∣mium on the building by reason of any assurance on the goods.</P>
<P>For accommodation of such persons as are desirous of being assured for more than one year. a discount of 5 l. per cent. per annum, on the yearly premium will be allowed for all years except the first, and persons so assured are not subject to any calls or contribution to make good losses.</P>
<P>Every person upon application to be assured with this Company, is to deposit 2 s. and 6 d. for the mark, and 6 s. for the Policy, on sums not exceeding 1000 l. and 11 s. for the Policy, on sums exceeding 1000 l.
<PB N="18" REF="38"/>
which money is to be returned, if the assurance pro∣posed is not agreed to. No Policy is to be of any force till the premium for one year is paid.</P>
<P>In adjusting losses, no plate is to be valued at more than six shillings per ounce, except by special agree∣ment.</P>
<P>Persons assured by this corporation do not depend upon an uncertain fund or contribution, nor are they subject to any covenants or calls to make good losses which may happen to themselves or others; the capital stock of this corporation being an unquestionable se∣curity to the assured, in case of loss or damage by fire. And in case of dispute, the assureds have a more ready and effectual method of recovery, than can be had a∣gainst any societies who do not act under a common seal.</P>
<P>This corporation will, in case of fire, allow all rea∣sonable charges attending the removal of goods, and pay the sufferer's loss, whether the goods are destroyed, lost, or damaged by such removal, without any deduction.</P>
<P N="9">9 As an addition to the expence of insurance, go∣vernment has laid a tax of 1 s. 6 d. on every 100 l. insured, which must be paid at the time you pay your insurance, which is always a year in advance.</P>
<P N="10">10. It is customary for these offices to have insert∣ed in the body of the policy the particular articles you insure, and how much upon each; as for example: Cloaths 50 l. books 30 l. furniture 150 l. plate 70 l. &amp;c. and though you were to insure to the amount of 1000 l. they never pay more than you can make ap∣pear you have lost. If insuring as above, you have lost 100 l. of cloaths, they will pay no more than 50 l. the sum insured, and the same in other articles. It is folly, therefore, to insure beyond the value of your real property. If your property increases at any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ture time, and you wish to insure more, you can have a new policy for 6 s. 6 d.</P>
<P N="11">11. In case of removal, the same policy will do, with the addition of an indorsement, for which they charge one shilling.</P>
<P N="12">12. All these offices pay for the removal of goods, in case of an adjoining fire.</P>

<HEAD>Cautions against Fire.</HEAD>
<P N="13">13. To guard against fire, every master or mistress of a family should be particularly attentive, that ser∣vants put every fire out before they go to bed, and that they put out the candles in their own room; for if a fire does not begin in your own house, as watchmen are always about to give notice, there is sufficient time to escape. But if families should be so unfortunate as to be surprised by fire, and cannot escape at the door, they should by all means endeavour to be cool, and not be too much alarmed—fear overcomes reason, and will prevent studying our safety. If there be no way out at the top of the house; from the first floor win∣dows, or even from the second, a person might escape by tying the blankets and sheets together, fastening one end to a chair, with the window half down, and throwing the other end out, and lowering himself down by the blankets, &amp;c. the window will prevent the chair following you.</P>
<P N="14">14. The law enjoins, that the parish-officers shall pay as a reward to the turn-cock, whose water first reaches the place where any fire breaks out, a sum not exceeding ten shillings; to the first engine brought complete, a sum not exceeding thirty shillings; to the second a sum not exceeding twenty shillings; and to the third a sum not exceeding ten shillings: and to make persons careful of fire, whenever a chimney takes fire, and the house is not burnt, or wherever any mis∣chief is done to a house by fire beginning in a chim∣ney, and the parish-officers pay the rewards as above, the tenant or lodger, whose chimney is thus set on fire, shall re-pay the church-wardens the said sums, or such part of them as a justice shall direct, if the matter is referred to him. 14 Geo. 3. c. 78.</P>

But as a preservative against fires, every pa∣rish is furnished with long ladders: these are kept at certain places, and every family should know where they are kept, and write it down, and fix the writing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n some conspicuous part of the house, as also in what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tuation the fire-plugs are; by doing this, people can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lways have recourse to them.</P>
<P N="16"><PB N="20" REF="40"/>16. If families have any thing to preserve more than ordinary; for example, shop-books, books of account, writings, bank-notes, cash, &amp;c. as these things take but little room, it would be adviseable for those who have no other secure place, to put them every night into a bag, and place them in their chamber by their cloaths; they can thus be readily carried off.</P>
<P N="17">17. Some families have stone-closets, others have iron chests, but the above method would be almost equally as secure.</P>
<P N="18">18. Tradesmen would do well to keep duplicates of their books, and lodge one set in the house of a friend; the occurrences of a week might be transcribed at the week's end.</P>
<P N="19">19. Those who have bank-notes should always en∣ter the number, date and sum of each note, in a book, as soon as received, in which case, if destroyed, on giving the bank security to re-pay the money, in case the note ever appears against them, they will give the loser the cash. If they receive them of bankers, and can remember where they received them, and on whose account, such bankers will furnish them with the particulars, as they always enter them in their books.</P>
<P N="20">20. If a neighbouring house is on fire, preserve your temper, be cool and wary; don't be in haste to open your doors and let in the rabble, be they as impatient as they may; for in fires, thieves are always ready to plunder a house, and you may lose more that way than any other. The insurance-offices always retain in their service a number of men to attend at fires; these may be known by their dress and badge; and if you admit any into your house to assist you in removing your property, let these be the only people. The master of the house should stand at the door himself for that purpose, and the goods, as removed, should be carried to the house of some friend in the neighbourhood, on the opposite side of the street.</P>
<P N="21">21. The taxes of a house in London are nearly half the rent, and are as follow:</P>
<P N="1">1. Land-tax, a tax on the ground, paid by the te∣nant, half-yearly, but generally allowed by the land∣lord in the rent, if no agreement to the contrary.—
<PB N="21" REF="41" MS="y"/>
This is generally four shillings in the pound, but in some parishes less than others.</P>
<P N="2">2. A house-tax paid to Government, by the tenant, of six-pence, nine-pence, or one shilling in the pound according to the rent. The rent, in this tax, is rated to the full. See <HI>Houses,</HI> 15.</P>
<P N="3">3. If the house has a retail-shop belonging to it, it pays an additional tax of from four shillings to two shillings in the pound, according to the rent of the house. This to be paid also by the tenant. See <HI>Houses,</HI> 16.</P>
<P N="4">4. The poor's-rate is another tax, but a parochial one, paid by the tenant to the overseers of the parish, for the maintenance of the poor. This is collected every half-year, and the assessment is from one to six shillings in the pound, or more, according to the num∣ber of poor in the parish. This assessment is made by the parish officers, and ratified by a bench of justices. The book, with this ratification, and the sums each house-keeper is to pay, is brought round to every house, when the money is collected, and each inhabi∣tant may see how much others pay, then or at any other time, on paying six-pence or a shilling. The rent of each house is generally estimated in the parish-book at two-thirds of the real rent paid; and if any person finds that he pays more in proportion than the rest of the parish, he may obtain redress, by an appli∣cation to the quarter-sessions, at a very little expence.</P>
<P>Any person occupying any house, &amp;c. out of which any other person assessed has removed, or which, at the making the rate was empty, every person so removing, and the person so coming into and occupying the same, shall pay to such rate in proportion to the time he oc∣cupied the same. In case of dispute, the proportion to be ascertained by two justices. 17 Geo. 2. c. 38. s. 12.</P>
<P N="5">5. Another tax is the window-tax, paid by the te∣nant to Government, and collected half-yearly.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="42"/>This is assessed in the following manner:—

<P>Persons are to pay only for two houses, and those containing the greatest number of windows.</P>
<P>Glass-doors, and lights over doors, are here consi∣dered as windows.</P>
<P N="7">7. The next tax is the church-wardens rate, for re∣pairing the church. The county-rate is generally col∣lected with it. This is only collected occasionally, and may be from three-pence in the pound to two or three shillings, according to the exigencies required.</P>
<P N="8">8. Another rate or assessment is the paving-tax, for repairing, cleaning, and lighting the streets. This is one shilling and six-pence in the pound, of two-thirds of the rent or value.</P>
<P N="9">9. Another is for watching them, but this is a trifle.</P>
<P N="10">10. There is a further call on every householder for Easter-offerings, for the rector or vicar of the parish; this is four-pence a-head for every one in each family capable of receiving the sacrament, paid once a year, at Easter. But this seldom is collected; it is generally lest to each family to give what they please; but it is always expected that they give something; perhaps a few shillings.</P>
<P>Once or twice a year the church-wardens generally bring round a book, to make a collection for the lectu∣rer or afternoon preacher. At this time a house∣keeper generally gives a few shillings, but this is op∣tional.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="44"/>In some parishes, twenty or thirty shillings a year, more or less, are paid by house-keepers, in proportion to their rent, in lieu of tithes.</P>
<P N="11">11. A further expence to the inhabitants is the river water, with which each house is served, from about twenty-four to thirty shillings a year, according to the time of serving, whether every day or three times a week.</P>
<P N="1">1. The London-bridge water-works supply the city, and the greatest part of its liberties, with Thames wa∣ter, at the rate of from twenty-four to thirty shillings (paid half-yearly) according to the distance from Lon∣don-bridge. The pipes of this Company spread all over the city to Tower-hill, Snow-hill, Shore-ditch, and St. Dunstan's-church, Fleet-street. Office at Lon∣don-bridge.</P>
<P N="2">2. The York-building water-works, (office in Vil∣liers-street, attendance from three in the afternoon till seven) supplies Westminster, and the west end of the town, as far as Holborn, with Thames water, and will convey the water, if desired, to the upper-stories of a house, the second or third story, according to their situation. The higher the house stands from the water side, the less height can they convey the water. The prices of the water is the same with the London-bridge water-works; only, if the water is to be conveyed to the second or third story, more money is paid annu∣ally, from thirty shillings to five pounds. The Thames water is reckoned softer than that of the new river.— If a fire happens in the night, application for water from this Company, and that of London-bridge, must be made at the respective offices, and it will be some time, half an hour or more, before they can get their engines to work.</P>
<P N="3">3. The New-River Company (office in Dorset-street, Fleet-street) supplies all London on the north side of the Thames, from Mile-end turnpike to Hyde-park corner, with water brought twenty miles from London, to a reservoir at Islington. The terms of this Company are rather higher than those of other water-companies, but the water is generally clearer and better. They serve families from twenty-four shillings a year to five
<PB N="25" REF="45"/>
pounds, according to the quantity of water they re∣quire, which is settled by the collector of the district, whose name may be known, by applying at the office, in Dorset-street. This collector also will furnish fa∣milies with the names of the turn-cocks in his district, printed on paper, to whom application is to be made in cases of fire; and in the collector's receipts will be found the place to apply to, in want of water and o∣ther complaints. This Company conveys the water to upper stories of houses, without any additional ex∣pence than the lead pipes, which are the property of, and must be fixed by, the tenant; the nearer a house stands to the Thames side, that is, the lower it is from the reservoirs, the higher in the houses the water can be conveyed. In the New River Water-works, the water runs from an eminence; in the London-bridge and York Company, it is forced up by fire; of course, the higher it is conveyed, the more money annually is required.</P>
<P N="4">4. There are other water-works, those of Chelsea, Hampstead, Bayswater, Shadwell, Lambeth, &amp;c. that supply other parts of the town, and the Borough of Southwark, with soft water, and on nearly the same terms. Thrale's water-works, that supply part of Southwark, serve so low as 20 s. a-year.</P>
<P N="5">5. The lead pipes from the main, that is, from the middle of the street, are considered as belonging to the house, and must be paid for, and kept in repair by the tenant; other repairs and expences are paid by the se∣veral companies.</P>
<P N="6">6. Attendance is always given at the respective offi∣ces from morning till night, and complaints immediate∣ly redressed. It is proper to send to these offices im∣mediately on a fire breaking out, especially those that supply the Thames water.</P>
<P N="7">7. It is adviseable for every house-keeper, on first coming to London, to apply to the offices for the names of the turn-cocks, and where they live; and al∣so to fire-offices, for the places where the fire-engines are; also to the vestry-clerks of the different parish∣es, for the places where the ladders are kept, and from year to year, who are the constables and other
<PB N="26" REF="46"/>
parish-officers, and to write these down and stick them up in the kitchen, or other part of the house, that the earliest application, in case of fire, may be made for every necessary assistance.</P>
<P N="8">8. In frosty weather, to secure water to the house is the care and business of the tenant. For this pur∣pose, fresh horse-dung should be laid over the pave∣ment under which the lead pipes pass, and some should be wound round the pipe as it crosses the area. Dung can be had at any of the stables for a trifle, and the ex∣pence of fetching it in a cart is not much.</P>

<HEAD>BAKERS, BREAD AND MILK.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. EVERY peck loaf shall weigh 17 lb. 6 oz. averdupois weight; every half peck 8 lb. 11 oz. and every quartern loaf 4 lb. 5 oz. and an half; to be weighed within twenty-four hours after baking or being sold, under the penalty of from 1 s. to 5 s. for every ounce deficient, at the discretion of the magis∣trate, the bread to be taken and weighed in his pre∣sence; for every deficiency of weight under one ounce, the penalty is from 6 d. to 2 s. 6 d. 31 Geo. 2. c. 39. 3 Geo. 3. c. 11.</P>
<P N="2">2. Bread made for sale shall be fairly marked; wheaten-bread with a large Roman W, and household-bread with an H, to ascertain under what denomina∣tion it was made, under a penalty not exceeding 20 s. nor under 5 s. Ibid.</P>
<P N="3">3. Any baker or other person demanding or taking a higher price for bread, than what the same shall be set at by the assize, or refusing to sell to any person any of the sorts allowed or ordered to be made; when he shall have more than is necessary for the immediate use of his family or customers, forfeits not exceeding 40 s. nor less than 10 s. Ibid.</P>
<P N="4">4. If a certain weight of wheaten-bread costs 8 d. the same weight of standard wheaten (to be marked S. W.) shall be sold for 7 d. and the same weight of
<PB N="27" REF="47"/>
household-bread shall be sold for 6 d. on penalty of from 10 s. to 40 s. Ibid.</P>
<P>Bread inferior to wheaten is not to be sold at a higher price than household-bread is set at, on penalty of 20 s. Ibid. Applications to a magistrate.</P>
<P N="5">5. Bakers' men, who carry the bread round to their customers, will sometimes, if families run up a bill, sell a loaf or two by the way, and put the money into their own pockets, telling their masters, that they left them at such houses. The master, of course, charges the customer for bread he never had; and, when the bill comes to be paid, it perhaps occasions a dispute, and the buyer finds himself obliged to pay for it after all. To avoid this, the best method is, never to run a bill with a baker, but pay for the bread as it is left; or, if this be inconvenient, order the bill in every Monday morning, while the occurrences of the week are in the memory: these bills, examined and filed, will prevent your being cheated. Bakers, like milk-women, will sometimes leave tallies, on which they daily chalk what is left, but a mark is easily added, while the servant is inattentive, which robs you of the price of a loaf, or a pint of milk. These marks are sometimes made on the door-post, oftener without the door than within; of course an addition can be made unknown to your servant, as the baker or milk-woman passes the door; or they may be wholly rubbed out, by wanton boys or others, as is frequently the case; and when the score is gone, the baker or milk-woman may charge what they please; and as they can sell a loaf or a pint of milk to those who pay ready money, and se∣crete that money; to conceal this fraud from their mas∣ters, they will score it up to their customers on credit.</P>
<P N="6">6. With respect to milk, though sold at 3 d. a quart, it is always mixed with water. There are cows that are driven into the streets, about the west end of the town, from which you may have your milk, and see it milked, at 4 d. a quart, but the milk of these is not very good, as the cows are driven about all the day; yet it is better than what is brought by milk-women.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="28" REF="48"/>
<HEAD>BUTCHERS AND MEAT.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. IT is by no means adviseable to deal with one butcher, unless you can agree to have all your meat, viz. beef, mutton, veal, lamb and pork, weigh∣ed in, at one and the same price, all the year round; which some butchers will do at 5 d. a pound, and occasionally give you, at the same price, a quarter of house-lamb. If you enter into such an agreement, take care to have a bill of the weight always sent home with the meat, and order it to be weighed by your own people.</P>
<P>If you make no such agreement, and deal regularly with one butcher, you will frequently be charged for a joint you never had; and for half a pound, or a quarter of a pound more than the joint weighs: and you will always pay a halfpenny, or a farthing more per pound, than was you to go to market and cheapen it yourself. In buying a joint at market, of seven pounds and an half, you may often deduct the half pound, but when sent home by a butcher who credits you, never. This conduct in a family will occasion a great saving at the year's end. If you pay your butcher but once a quarter, be sure to have a bill of the weight and price sent in with your meat, and a re∣gular bill of the week's meat every Monday morning. In this case you will see what you are about, and not be liable to be imposed upon.</P>
<P N="2">2. Good meat should not look lean, dry, or shrivel∣led; the fleshy part should be of a bright red, and the fat of a clear white. When the flesh looks pale, and the fat yellow, the meat is not good. Cow beef is worth a penny a pound less than ox beef, except it be the meat of a maiden heiser. In a buttock you may know it by the udder.</P>
<P N="3">3. The average price of beef is from 4d. a pound to 5d. The prime boiling parts are the rump, buttock edge-bone, briskit, thick and thin flank; roasting pie∣ces, the surloin and ribs.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="49"/>Butchers make a difference in price between pieces of beef to roast and boil; if you take a piece of each, they will sell prime beef for 4d. halfpenny; if a boil∣ling piece alone 4d. if roasting alone 5d.</P>
<P>If you want rump-steaks in any quantity, it is cheap∣er to give 7d. a pound without bone than 4d. halfpenny for the whole rump. A buttock is the cheapest joint, as it is free from bone; for if you wish it, the butcher will sell it you without the marrow-bone, which is worth its weight for the marrow.</P>
<P>In buying a buttock of beef, be careful you do not buy the mouse-buttock for the prime one. The differ∣ence is easily known; the prime buttock is first cut off the leg, and is the thickest; the mouse-buttock is thin∣ner, and cut off the legs between the buttock and the leg bone, is coarse meat, and not worth so much by one penny a pound.</P>
<P>A bullock's tongue will sell from 2s. to 4s. 6d. ac∣cording to its size and goodness. A good tongue should look plump, clear and bright, not of a blackish hue.</P>
<P N="4">4. The flesh of mutton should be of a bright red, and its fat of a clear white; and unless it is very fat it is worth little. Ewe mutton is not worth so much as weather by a penny in the pound; mutton five years old, if it can be got, is the most delicious; its natural gravy is brown. A leg of ewe mutton may be known by the udder on its skirt. The average price of prime weather mutton is 4d. halfpenny per pound, though it will sell often for 5d. halfpenny.</P>
<P N="5">5. The average price of veal is 6d. though it will often sell for 8d. particularly the fillet. Large veal is seldom good. Veal should be fat and very white, like rabbit or chicken, not red, or look as if it was much blown up.</P>
<P N="6">6. The average price of grass lamb is 6d. a pound, that of pig-pork the same, though pork chops will of∣ten sell for 7d. or 8d.</P>
<P>House lamb at Christmas is dear, and if fine and sat will sell for 7s. 6d. a quarter, the leg 5s. At other times it may be bought so low as 3s. 6d. a quarter.</P>
<P N="7">7. If your butcher sends you any tainted meat, he may be fined, by complaining to a magistrate; but the
<PB N="30" REF="50"/>
readiest and least troublesome method of redress, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> put up with a trifling loss, and deal with such a butche no more.</P>
<P N="8">8. The best markets in town are, St. James's, New port, Clare-market, Newgate, Honey-lane, and Leaden hall, for meat; for vegetables, Covent-Garden and Leaden-hall; for fresh butter, Leaden-hall, particular¦ly for Epping butter and cream cheese.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>POULTRY.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. POULTRY of all sorts may be purchased cheape<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the higlers at the several markets, than at the Poulterer's shops; but of the higlers you must take care what you buy: fowls and chickens should be fat plump and white, particularly white legged. Chicken may be known by their size, and fowls are young, if they have no spurs.</P>
<P>By the same marks you may judge of turkeys. A large cock-turkey at Christmas cannot be bought for less than 6s. or 7s. at other times 5s.; a hen turkey from 4s. to 5s. 6d. Fat crammed chickens, about ten weeks old, on or about Lady-day, are worth about 3s. 6d. each, and a fine fowl at Midsummer is worth 3s. 6d. at other times chicken may be bought of higlers for 3s. or 4s. a couple, and fowls at the same price.</P>
<P>Ducks and geese should look white, very plump, and broad over the breast. A fat goose, weight about 10 lb. on Michaelmas-day, is worth 5 s. at other times about 3 s. 6 d. A green goose in May is worth 4 s. The price of ducks is from 3 s. a couple to 5 s. Wild ducks, in frosty weather, may be bought in Fleet-market for 2 s. 6 d. a couple; at other times they are worth 2 s. each. If they smell fishy they are of little value; to know this, take one of the pen-feathers from the wing, and put it down the throat; if it smells fishy in draw∣ing it out, the bird will taste so. Dove-house pidge∣ons, in May or June, may be bought for 3 s. 6 d. or 4 s. a dozen. In winter time, poulterers will ask 1 s. 6 d. a piece. Larks, in hard weather, may be
<PB N="31" REF="51"/>
had for 1 s. 6 d. a dozen. They are best soon after harvest. Guinea fowls are best in Spring, when they get fat without feeding. At this time they are worth from 7 s. to 10 s. each; at other times they are worth little: these last can be bought only of the poulterers, of whom quails also may be had after harvest, at 2 s. 6d. each. Woodcocks are from 2 s. to 4 s. each, accord∣ing to the plenty or scarcity.</P>
<P N="2">2. Eggs are from three a groat to eight, according to the time of the year; they are dearest in winter: but such as wish for new-laid eggs may frequently get them at the livery-stables, for one penny or three-half∣pence each.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>FISH.</HEAD>
<P>FISH is generally dearest and best, when in sea∣son.</P>
<P N="1">1. Fish-mongers charge a price for fish according to their customers; to deal with one man regularly, and pay him once or twice a year, is as bad as dealing with butchers in the same way. A fish-monger near the squares will charge 2 s. 6 d. for a mackrell, which may be bought for half the money at Charing-cross; and for one-third of the money from those who cry them about.</P>
<P>To such as live convenient, Billingsgate is the place to buy sea-fish at, whether you want little or much.— Market-days there are Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays; but market-days are the dearest days.— You may often buy them fresh, and forty per cent. cheaper, on the intermediate days. By purchasing at Billingsgate, you may buy at one-third of the price which fish-mongers charge, and if you lay out a few shillings, it will pay for a person to carry them home: fish-mongers, at this market, purchase at break of day; and, when the market is not glutted, they will, at those times, buy up all the largest fish, but there is always suf∣ficient lest to serve private families. There is an act of parliament to oblige fish-mongers to sell brill, bret, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mall turbot, not exceeding 16 inches from eye to tail,
<PB N="32" REF="52"/>
for 6 d. a pound, under a penalty of 20 s. to the in∣former; for asking more or refusing to weigh or mea∣sure it, any person may seize the fish-monger, and deliver him to a constable, to carry him before a jus∣tice, who will not only fine him, but make him return the money. 33 Geo. 2. c. 27. But when turbit is in season, as in May and June, one of 6 lb. weight may be bought at Billingsgate for 3 s. 6 d. or 4 s. other fish in proportion.</P>
<P N="3">3. Mackrell, in June and July, are in great plenty, and may be bought at Billingsgate by the quarter of a hundred, for 2 d. or 3 d. a piece. Mackrell and her∣rings, if fresh, will look bright, their gills red, and their eyes clear. Mackrell are reckoned cheap at 4 d. or 5 d. each. If fish is firm, not flabby or slimy, the gills ruddy or bleeding, and the eyes bright, you may depend on it it is fresh; but if otherwise, not so. Sal∣mon, when cut, should look red and bleeding fresh.— But, put your nose to the gills, and you will soon find if it is stale.</P>
<P>Thames salmon is always double the price of other salmon; not that it is better tasted, but being later out of the water, it can be crimped, which gives it a firm∣ness. The price of sea-salmon is from 9 d. to 3 s. a pound.</P>
<P>Lobsters and crabs should always be bought alive.— Those of the middling size are always the best. No overgrown animal food is delicious.</P>
<P>The average price of soals is about 1 s. a pound, though they are not sold by the pound, but the pair. Herrings are bought for about 1 s. a dozen; whitings 2 s. a dozen; haddocks according to their size, for about 6 d. a pound. Large cod, at the dearest time, may be purchased for about 1 s. or 1 s. 3 d. a pound; at the cheapest for one-third of the money. Skate at about 6 d. a pound, and barrel cod, in Lent, for about 6 d. a pound. If a family could dispense with a quan∣tity of salt fish, dried cod may be bought at the dry fish-mongers, in Thames-street, in winter, for about 5 s. for 28 lb. and barrel cod, or pickled salmon by the kit, at a very reasonable price. The price of a barrel of the best oysters, Colchester or Milton, is
<PB N="33" REF="53"/>
3s. 6 d. Dutch eels 4 d. or 6 d. a pound. Smelts from 2 s. a hundred to 5 s. Prawns from 1 s. 6 d. to 3 s. a hundred.</P>
<P>Fresh-water fish is in price as follows: Eels, jack, carp and perch, 1 s. a pound; trout and tench 1 s. 6 d. gudgeons 6 d. or 9 d. a dozen; flounders from 9 d. to 3 d. a piece, according to their size. Fresh-water fish are kept by fish-mongers, in cisterns, and should be bought alive.</P>
<P>Small turbots are easily distinguished from Dutch plaice; for plaice have many yellow spots on their back, turbots have none.</P>
<P>Haddock may be known from small cod, by two black spots, one on each shoulder. Small cod is a bad fish, but the haddock is a good one.</P>
<P>Half a kit of pickled salmon, neat weight about 16 lb. may be purchased at the dry fish-mongers, in Thames-street, in summer time, May, June, July, &amp;c. for 9 s. and in September, &amp;c. when it is equally good, for 5 s. In winter-time it will keep a long while.</P>

<HEAD>BUTTER AND CHEESE.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. FOR fresh butter, Leadenhall market is the best and cheapest in London. The best fresh lump butter, in summer, may be bought for 9 d. halfpenny or 10 d. a pound; in winter for 11 d. or 12 d. Ep∣ping butter, which is the finest in flavour, may be there bought for 2 d. a pound more than lump butter. Butter-shops sell this for 1 s. 6 d. a pound.</P>
<P N="2">2. In winter time, Cambridge and Dorsetshire salt but∣ter arrives fresh in London twice a week, and is with∣in one penny or a halfpenny a pound as dear as fresh; but the best way for a family is to buy a half firkin, which weighs 28 lb. of the best Yorkshire butter — This may be bought for 17 s. or 18 s. the half firkin, less than 8 d. a pound, and may be bought agreeable to the palate of the buyer; but when you taste it, taste a piece on the outside, next the tub; if this is good, and free from any rankness, you may be certain the
<PB N="34" REF="54"/>
middle is. But the middle shall often be sweet, when the outsides are rank; and butter-men, knowing this, always give a taste out of the middle. The Dorsetshire butter, in tubs with broad hoops, weight about 80 lb. rather fetches the best price, but for keeping it is the best butter.</P>
<P N="3">3. Bad butter is not to be mixed with good, on pain of forfeiting double the value. Buyers of butter should set their mark on the tub, &amp;c. and if the sellers open the tubs, or put in other butter, after the tubs are thus marked, they are liable to a penalty of 10 s. for every hundred weight. Application to a magistrate. 13 &amp; 14 Car. 2. c. 16. 4 and 5 W. &amp; M. c. 7.</P>
<P N="4">4. Every firkin of butter shall weigh 56 lb. without the cask.</P>
<P N="5">5. Cheese is always the better for keeping two or three years, provided it be kept dry. Families who like good old cheese should buy it one year under ano∣ther, as they do their wine, &amp;c. Old cheese good for any thing can seldom be met with; and if it is, cheese-mongers ask a large price for it. Cheese, a year and a half old, of the best dairies, (and the best is always the most delicious, and in the end the cheapest) can be bought from 4 d. halfpenny a pound to 6 d. In buy∣ing of this, every house-keeper should please his own palate. Though decayed cheese will please many pa∣lates best, it may be bought a halfpenny, and some∣times a penny a pound under the price of sound cheese. Glocester cheese is generally a penny a pound under the price of Cheshire.</P>
<P N="6">6. In buying of bacon, the Wiltshire is reckoned the best, and may be bought at capital shops for 6 d. halfpenny or 7 d. a pound, by the flitch: small bacon, such as weighs about 40 lb. the slitch, is the most deli∣cate. In buying it, have the flitch cut through, and if the fat looks red, and the skin is thin, it will pro∣bably turn out well, and boil firm; but if you make an agreement, the seller will change it, if you dislike it. Rusty bacon looks brown when cut, particularly at the inside edge.</P>
<P N="7">7. You may judge of hams by running a knife into the body of them, and smelling them. Yorkshire
<PB N="35" REF="55"/>
hams are sold for about 7 d. a pound, and Westmore∣land hams for 7 d. halfpenny. Westmoreland hams are the highest flavoured. Dried and pickled tongues may be bought from 3 s. 6 d. to 4 s. 6 d. a piece, ac∣cording to the size, at the oil and pickle-shops.</P>

<HEAD>BREWERS AND BEER.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. SMALL beer may be bought of different qualitie and prices, from 10 s. a barrel to 16 s. each bar¦rel 36 gallons; 14 s. a barrel is the general run; an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> brewers, if applied to for the purpose, will lay in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> quantity a family may use throughout the year, in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> winter, and engage it shall keep good and fresh th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> year round; if it turns four, they will take it back an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> change it for such as is not so; this is the best method of having good beer.</P>

<P N="3"><PB N="37" REF="57"/>3. Private families, not dealing in foreign wine, must have a permit, as with spirits, with every quantity sent to them above three gallons, specifying the kind of wine, quantity, where bought, and the time allowed for con∣veying it, otherwise it is liable to be seized; but if your wine merchant omits to send such permit with the wine, the loss will be his. 26 Geo. 3. c. 59.</P>
<P N="4">4. Private families, wishing to remove wine exceed∣ing three gallons from one place to another, must ap∣ply to the exciseman of their district (by a note in writing) from whence such wines are to be removed, and on proving to the satisfaction of the collector or supervisor of the said district that the duties of the said wines have been paid, (for which purpose it will be necessary to keep the permits and produce them) and at the same time specifying the quantity of each sort of foreign wine to be removed; saying whether it be <HI>French</HI> red wine or <HI>French</HI> white wine, or foreign white wine not <HI>French,</HI> or foreign red wine not <HI>French;</HI> also the number and contents of casks, bottles, or vessels containing the same; and likewise whether it is to be removed by water or by land, and by what mode of con∣veyance.

<HEAD>COALS AND OTHER FUEL.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE price of coals in London is from 32 s. a chaldron to 50 s. In long frosts, they have ri∣sen so high as 5 l. but, on an average, they may be bought in summer time at 33 s. or 34 s. a chaldron.— House-keepers should endeavour to lay them in at the cheapest time: there are advertising coal-merchants, who, for ready money, will sell 39 bushels for two or three shillings under the price that others sell 38 bushels for; but in dealing with these, and indeed with other sellers, it is prudent to see the coals at the wharf, be∣fore they are sent in; and when they are sent in, to take care you have your measure, otherwise you may have your year's coals that will not burn, or pay a larger price for them than you expected. Good coals are generally large, black and shining: the Pontops are the best. If you trust to your coal-merchant, with re∣spect to the measurement, it will however be necessary
<PB N="39" REF="59"/>
that the number of sacks are counted when the coals are shot. Advertising coal-sellers go often by fictitious names, to avoid the penalties for short measure: it is proper, therefore, to be on your guard, particularly against those.</P>
<P N="2">2. By the several coal-acts passed this year, 1786, for the cities of London and Westminster, and the Bo∣rough of Southwark, coal-meters are appointed to measure coals when first carted, and re-measure them afterwards, if the buyer requests it: the coal-meters office for the city of London and its liberties, is in Earl-street, Blackfriar's-bridge; that for Westminster and its liberties at the bottom of Northumberland-street, in the Strand; and those for the Borough of Southwark and its districts at Marigold-stairs, Surry-side of Blackfriar's-bridge, and at the Sun and Hat-Block, in the Maize, Tooley-street. These offices are open all day, to hear complaints and give redress.</P>
<P N="3">3. Coals, when taken out of the barge, and sold as wharf-measure, are to be measured in the presence of a coal-meter. The seller to pay 4 d. a chaldron for measuring, which the buyer is to re-pay, on a ticket of such measurement being produced by the carman, under the penalty of 10 s. for the carter not delivering such ticket. But when brought in, if the buyer de∣clares himself dissatisfied with the measure, the driver of the cart shall not depart, till a coal-meter can be procured from the above offices to re-measure them, on pain of his forfeiting 20 s. and the owner of the cart 5 l.</P>
<P N="4">4. The carman shall be paid 2 s. 6 d. an hour for the time he waits, and the measurer shall be paid 6 d. for measuring each chaldron, by the buyer; but if, on re-measuring, they are found deficient, the seller shall pay the expences of re-measuring, and also forfeit 5 l. a bushel for every bushel deficient, and forfeit the chaldron of coals to the poor; the meter shall forfeit 5 l. a bushel, and the coal-porter that measured them 2 s. 6 d. a bushel.</P>
<P N="5">5. But to save the half-crown an hour paid for waiting, it is best to appoint a meter to attend at the time you expect the coals. If families would keep a
<PB N="40" REF="60"/>
bushel-measure, and one may be bought for 7 s. 6 d. a sack or two of the coals might be measured without much trouble.</P>
<P N="6">6. A labouring coal-meter, delivering tickets for coals which he was not present at the measuring of, shall forfeit 40s. and be incapacitated, and the principal shall forfeit 5 l. if the 40s. penalty is not paid by the labour∣ing meter in one month.</P>
<P N="7">7. A carter fraudulently delivering, or suffering coals to be taken from his cart, shall forfeit 40 s. or be whipped and imprisoned from one to three months.</P>
<P N="8">8. To punish offences, application must be made to a magistrate.</P>
<P N="9">9. All contracts for coals, not being less than five chaldrons, shall be for pool-measure, including the in∣grain or addition of one chaldron in twenty, though the term of pool-measure shall not be mentioned in the contract; that is, nine bushels or three sacks shall be given in with every five chaldrons, (though sellers now, if you buy but one chaldron, will profess to give you 38 bushels). 19 Geo. 2. c. 35.</P>
<P N="10">10. Wharfingers bribing a coal-meter shall forfeit 50 l.</P>
<P N="11">11. Sacks shall be, when empty, four feet long, and two feet wide; and none other shall be used, on pain of the wharfinger's forfeiting 5 l. and the coal-meter 40 s.</P>
<P N="12">12. Scotch coal is always in large pieces, and is bought by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wt. at about 40 s. a ton. This burns free, and to a white ash, of course clean burning, but is not so durable as Newcastle coals.</P>

<HEAD>SERVANTS.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. IN the choice of servants, a house-keeper cannot be too particular. London is so much the sink of vice, that the lower class of people are very much corrupted. Those brought from the country are soon infected with the dissolute manners of town-servants, and become equally bad with them. To expect at∣tachment from a servant is idle, and betrays an igno∣rance of the world. Servants will now and then af∣fect it, in order to gain the confidence of their em∣ployers, and thus forward their own interest; but, if we suppose them in our interest, it is because we do not thoroughly know them. Economy in a family, ser∣vants do not like. The more extravagant a master or mistress is, the better they live, and the more they can purloin; and should, what they call, a generous master or mistress fail in the world, owing to a waste or an in∣attention to domestic concerns, they will cry to their fellow-servants, "It is a pity! he was a good-natured generous man!—Come, let us go look for another place!" This being considered, we are to expect no∣thing from them but a performance of their duty, keep them whilst they do it, and discharge them when they neglect it.</P>
<P N="2">2. The first thing, then, is to endeavour to get good ones, if we do not bring them out of the country with us. There are, in different parts of the town, register-offices, or places where servants of all denominations attend at certain hours, and where a master may see them, at the expence of one shilling, and hire them; or, by sending a shilling to the keepers of such offices, and a description of the servant wanted, they will send you one, day after day, till you are suited; but as it is the refuse of servants in general that apply to these offices, you must not take the recommendation of the office-keeper, who is paid also by the servant for pro∣curing the place; nor any written character; for such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hings in London are procured from friends, and often <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orged; nay servants of bad character will often go fur∣ther,
<PB N="48" REF="68"/>
they will refer you to persons seemingly of cre∣dit, who perhaps know little of them. It is proper therefore, that the master or mistress should apply for the character themselves, make some enquiry concern∣ing the person they apply to, and ask all those questi∣ons they think necessary. There are few servant-maids in London, or indeed in the country, but what are whores; it is perhaps an uncharitable supposition, but it is nevertheless true. To expect, therefore, to meet with an innocent virtuous girl, is next to impossible; it is sufficient if she is orderly, and conducts herself with decorum. If a house-keeper cannot get a servant recommended by a friend, or some tradesman with whom he deals, such as the baker, butcher, poulterer, green-grocer, tallow-chandler, publican, or the like, I would recommend papers describing the servant want∣ed, and where to apply, being sent or left at the chandler's shops in the neighbourhood, which seldom fails of success; others will have recourse to advertise∣ments in the public newspapers, an insertion for which, once, costs 3 s. 6 d. If this mode is adopted, the best paper to advertise in is the <HI>Daily Advertiser</HI> in Fleet-street, which is taken in by almost all the publi∣cans in London. Such an advertisement will bring you scores of servants; and here you must be very careful in your choice, and particular as to charac∣ter; for an advertisement will bring with the good a number of disreputable people.</P>
<P N="3">3. The general wages of servants are as follow:— Steward, valet, butler, 30 l. a-year; women-cooks, 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> l. lady's-maids, from 12 l. to 20 l. inferior women servants, from 7 l. to 9 l. foot-men 14 l. and a livery: women-servants to provide their own tea and sugar.— Board-wages of an upper servant 10 s. 6 d. a week, with fire and candle, and 7 s. a week to an under-ser∣vant.</P>
<P N="4">4. They generally agree for a month's wages, or a month's warning, which is a bad method; as there are few servants, when warning is given, but will be very impertinent and untractable, it is far the best, when you mean to part with them, to get rid of them at once, be it ever so inconvenient: by enquiry an honest chair∣woman,
<PB N="49" REF="69"/>
to supply the place of a woman-servant, may be procured for 1 s. a day. If such are hired to wash, their wages are larger: 1 s. 6 d. with tea and a dram twice a day, and strong beer at dinner and sup∣per; but for this they slave hard, will begin work at two in the morning, and continue it till nine the next evening. If such a person is wanted, employ none of your own servant's recommending, but apply for their character to those house-keepers who have employed them, and on whom you can better rely.</P>
<P N="5">5. Women cooks, and servants of all work, when they hire themselves, will endeavour to get the kitch∣en-stuff allowed them as a perquisite; if you would not be robbed, never comply with this; nor allow your coachman the old wheels; for as the one will, to serve herself, strip your meat of its fat, melt more but∣ter than necessary, and convey the ends of candles, &amp;c. into the grease-pot, to increase its weight; so will the other often injure the wheels, if they are likely to last too long.</P>
<P N="6">6. If you deliver into the custody of servants, plate, china, linen, &amp;c. to keep; and tell them, before wit∣ness, they must be responsible for it; if they lose any part of it, the law will oblige them, as far as they are able, to make it good; but not else: to enable them, therefore, to pay for any thing missing, it is advise∣able to keep part of their wages in hand. As they are hired by the year, they should always be paid one half year under another, reserving half-a-year in hand. As to breaking of china, &amp;c. you cannot compel a servant to pay for it, unless it was so agreed on the hiring, or done designedly.</P>
<P N="7">7. To avoid disputes respecting wages, it is prudent to have the agreement in writing, and a receipt for what you pay; for (sorry am I to say it) this class of people make as little ceremony of taking a false oath, where there is no proof to the contrary, as of telling a lie.</P>
<P>Disputes with servants, about wages under <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0 l. and other things, if they cannot amicably be settled, should be referred to a neighbouring magistrate, who is autho∣rised to hear the complaint and redress it; the expence
<PB N="50" REF="70"/>
but trifling; but the wages of coachmen, grooms, and the like, magistrates can take no cognizance of.</P>
<P N="8">8. Where servants are hired for a year, they cannot be put away before the expiration of that term, with∣out some reasonable cause to be allowed by one justice; nor after the end of the term, without a quarter's warn∣ing given before witness; if a master discharges a ser∣vant otherwise, he is liable to a penalty of 40 s.— 5 Eliz. c. 4.</P>
<P>If a servant refuse to serve his term, he may be com∣mitted till he give security to serve the time; or he may be sent to the house of correction, and punished there as a disorderly person. 5 Eliz. c. 4. 7 Jac. c. 4.</P>
<P>A yearly servant is not to be discharged by reason of sickness, or any other disability by the act of God; not may his wages for those causes be abated. Dalt. 129. All hiring without stipulation of time is, strictly speak∣ing, hiring for a year, and the law so construes it.</P>
<P>Both master and servant may however part by mu∣tual consent, and then the allowance of the cause by a justice of peace is not necessary. A master's detaining wages, or not allowing sufficient meat, drink, &amp;c. is good cause for a servant's departure; but it must be al∣lowed by a justice. Dalt.</P>
<P>If a servant, hired for a term, quits his service be∣fore the end of his term, he loses all his wages; but if the master puts him away, he shall be paid to the time he served.</P>
<P>A woman-servant who marries is obliged to serve out her time; and if both man and wife agree to serve, they must perform the agreement. Dalt. 92.</P>
<P>If a servant be retained for a year, according to the statute 5 Eliz. c. 4, and the master die within that time, the executor must pay the wages; but not so if the retainer was not for a year.</P>
<P>A servant hired at a month's wages, or a month's warning, cannot quit his place, nor be discharged, a day before the expiration of the month, without the whole month's wages be paid, unless by the authority of a justice, for some reasonable complaint. If a ser∣vant, after warning given, is insolent, or refuses to do his duty, a magistrate, on complaint, will commit him
<PB N="51" REF="71"/>
to prison, for the time he has to serve; but the master will be ordered to pay him his wages whilst there.</P>
<P N="9">9. If a servant or workman assault his master or mistress, or any other having charge over them, he may be bound to his good behaviour, or be committed for a year, or less, at the discretion of two magistrates. 5 Eliz. c. 4. s. 21.</P>
<P N="10">10. If any servant shall purloin, or make away with his master's goods, to the value of 40 s. it is felony.— 12 Ann. c. 7.</P>
<P N="11">11. Should a woman with child procure herself to be retained with a master for a term, who knows no∣thing thereof, this is good cause to discharge her from her service; if she prove with child during her service it is the same; but if he does not discharge her before a magistrate, when he knows of it, and keeps her on, he must provide for her till her delivery, and one month after, and then she is to be sent to her place of settle∣ment. Dalt.</P>
<P N="12">12. A servant setting fire carelessly to a house, is liable to pay, on the oath of one witness, a hundred pounds to the sufferer, or be committed to hard labour for 18 months. 14 Geo. 3. c. 78.</P>
<P N="13">13. By the 25th of Geo. 3. c. 43, every person keeping one male-servant, shall pay annually for him

<P>Every man aged 21 and upwards, and a batchelor, shall pay an additional one pound five shillings for eve∣ry male servant he keeps. Ibid. s. 3.</P>
<P>These duties are to extend to servants of the follow∣ing descriptions, viz. maitre d'hotel, house steward, master of the horse, groom of the chamber, valet de chambre, butler, under butler, clerk of the kitchen, confectioner, cook, house porter, footman, running footman, coachman, groom, postilion, stable boy, help∣ers in stables, gardeners not being day labourers, park-keepers, gamekeeper, huntsman, whipper-in, waiters
<PB N="52" REF="72"/>
at taverns, coffeehouses, inns, alehouses, or any other houses licensed to sell wine, beer, ale, or other liquors, by retail, (other than occasional waiters) or by what∣ever name or names male servants acting in any of said capacities shall be called. Ibid. s. 4.</P>
<P>Every person keeping a woman servant, shall pay annually, for one, 2s. 6d. for two, 5s. each, for three or more, 10s. each. Ibid.</P>
<P>A batchelor in all cases pays double these duties. Ib.</P>
<P>Servants employed <HI>bona fide</HI> for the purposes of hus∣bandry, farming, dairy, or manufacture, or of any trade by which the master or mistress gain a livelihood, ex∣cepted. Ibid. s. 6.</P>
<P>Such persons as shall have living in their houses two or more lawful children, or grand-children, under 14 years of age, shall be allowed one woman servant duty free; such as have four children shall be allowed two women servants, and such as have six, three women servants. Thus, he who has four children pays but 2s. 6d. for the third servant, if he keeps three; if he has four servants, he pays 5s. each for two. Ib. s. 13.</P>
<P>Female servants under the age of 14, or above 60, are not to be assessed; parish certificates of the age to be produced. Ibid. s. 14.</P>
<P>No duty is to be paid for any servant employed for the purpose of husbandry, manufactures or trade.</P>
<P>Parish apprentices imposed on masters or mistresses to the number of two, shall be allowed, unless they are employed as livery servants, or in the capacity of other servants. Ibid. s. 8.</P>
<P>Coachmen, grooms, postilions, or helpers, let out to hire by way of job, shall be paid for by those who em∣ploy them. Gardeners also, who shall contract for keeping any garden in order, shall be paid for by those who employ them. Ibid. s. 7.</P>
<P>Every officer of horse under the rank and not receiv∣ing the pay of a field-officer, is to be allowed one man servant, whether such servant is a private soldier in his regiment or not. Ibid. s. 11.</P>
<P>Every officer without distinction in the land service, of every description, including marines, who employs some soldier of the regiment or company to which he
<PB N="53" REF="73"/>
belongs as a servant, and every officer in the navy un∣der the rank of a master and commander, in actual ser∣vice, who employs one sailor as a servant, that is actu∣ally born upon the books of the ship to which such officer belongs, are for such servants exempt from this duty. Ibid.</P>
<P>Disabled officers on half-pay are to be allowed one servant on application to the commissioners and proof given. Ibid. s. 12.</P>
<P>The window and house-tax collectors to collect these duties, and the duties to be paid quarterly. Ibid.</P>
<P>Assessors shall give or leave notice in writing yearly, at the dwelling-houses of all masters and mistresses within their district, requiring them to prepare and produce, within 14 days from such notice, separate lists in writing of all their men and women servants, their christian and sirnames, and the capacity in which they are employed, such list to contain the greatest number of servants, male and female, retained by such master or mistress, at any one time in the year, ending on the 5th of April preceding such notice, to be signed by the master or mistress, and to be delivered to the assessors who is to call for it; and if such list be refused or ne∣glected to be delivered, then the assessors are to pro∣ceed to make out, from the information they can get, an assessment of their own, from which there shall be no appeal, unless the person to assessed shall prove that they were not at home from the time of notice to the day for the delivery of the lists to the assessors, or shall assign some other substantial cause satisfactory to the commissioners, Ibid. s. 26.</P>
<P>All masters or mistresses must accompany their lists with a declaration, whether they mean to pay for any, and how many servants, in any other place or parish, and to specify in what place or places. S. 28.</P>
<P>As this is an annual tax, if a person keeps at any one time two servants, for example, and enters these two, that is, asserts in his written notice that he had two before the 5th of April, should one of these ser∣vants quit his service a month afterwards, he must pay for the two, till 5th April following.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="74"/>If assessors discover any deficiency in the lists deli¦vered to them, they may surcharge or add to those lists S. 29.</P>
<P>Persons refusing or neglecting to furnish the lists and declarations required as above, forfeit 10 l. S. 32.</P>
<P>All servants omitted in the said lists, and added in the surcharge, are to be rated double; one half of which shall go to the assessor or surveyor so surcharging them, S. 33.</P>
<P>Every person having a lodger in his house keeping a servant or servants, must on a week's notice deliver lists similar to those required of housekeepers, with the addition of the christian and sirname of the lodger, as well as of his servants, under the penalty of 10 l. Ib. s. 34.</P>
<P>Appeals for redress must be made to the commission∣ers; and persons dissatisfied with their decisions may resort to a judge of the court of King's-Bench, as in the act on Windows, which see. S. 35, 39.</P>
<P N="14">14. If you never deal with tradesmen upon credit, should your servants to whom you give money to pur∣chase things, put the money in their pockets, and order them to be set down to you, you are not obliged to pay for them; but if you sometimes send money, and some∣times deal upon credit, though you should send the money for any article, if your servant does not pay it, you will be obliged to pay it again; for your tradesman cannot be supposed to know whether the money was sent or not.</P>
<P N="15">15. If you would avoid being robbed, never suffer your servants to take acquaintances down into the kit∣chen with them. Many instances have occurred where villains have made acquaintance with incautious ser∣vants, purposely to find a method of breaking into the house, and learning what there is worth coming for.</P>
<P N="16">16. To save trouble to the master and servants, where many are not kept, it is a good method to have in your sitting room, near the bell, a paper posted, with the ne∣cessary articles on it, in divisions, that are chiefly want∣ed, such as, Coals, Candles, Beer, Water, Broom, Lay the Cloth, Go to the Door, &amp;c. with a pin, to
<PB N="55" REF="75"/>
which a line is fixed with a lead going down into the kitchen to a similar paper fixed there; then, by fixing this pin in a hole in either of the divisions above, the weight will drop or rise to the same division below. Do this before you ring your bell, and order your ser∣vant to look at the index; she will then know what is wanted before she comes, and bring it with her. The expence of this index is trifling.</P>
<P N="17">17. It may also in some families be worth while to have a line from the parlour to the street door, to open it without going out of the parlour. This, where there is but one servant, saves a great deal of trouble.</P>

<P N="1">1. EVERY substantial house-keeper, living in the parish, is liable to be chosen church-warden, a a vestry in Easter-week, except peers, members of par∣liament, the clergy, counsellors, attornies, apotheca∣ries who have served seven years, freemen of the cor∣poration of surgeons in London, dissenting teachers and preachers, and private men personally serving for themselves in the militia, during the time of such ser∣vice. 6 W. c. 4. 18 Geo. 2. c. 15. 1 W. sess. 1. c. 18. 10 &amp; 11 W. c. 22. 2 Geo. 3. c. 20. 2 Roll's Abr. 272.

All persons who have prosecuted a felon to con∣viction, shall be exempted from the office of church-warden or overseer in the parish where the offence was committed; and the judge's certificate of having done this may be once assigned over; and the assignee shall have the same privilege. 10 &amp; 11 W. c. 23. This is called a Tyburn ticket.</P>

<P N="1">1. THE church-wardens rate must be made with the consent of the major part of the parishioners, house-keepers, or occupiers of land. In order to which public notice of a vestry ought to be given the Sunday before, either in the church, after divine service is end∣ed, or at the church-door, as the parishioners come out, both of the calling of the said meeting, and also of the time and place of its assembling. And it is usu∣al, that for half an hour before it begins, one of the church-bells be tolled, to give the parishioners notice when they are met. Par. L. 54.</P>
<P N="2">2. The major part of them that appear, shall bind the parish. But in large populous parishes, a custom has obtained of yearly chusing a certain number of the most respectable men to represent all the rest, who are called a <HI>select vestry.</HI> Such a vestry exists at Mary-le∣bone, St. George's, Hanover-square, St. Mary Hill, &amp;c. and no parishioner who does not pay to the church-rates has a vote, except the parson or vicar.</P>
<P N="3">3. If any person finds himself aggrieved at the irre∣gularity of the church-wardens assessment for the re∣pairs of the church, his appeal must be to the ecclesias∣tical judge. Degge 172.</P>
<P N="4">4. And if any refuse to pay the rates, they are to be sued for in the ecclesiastical courts. Degge 171. A Quakers may be prosecuted before the justices of the peace. Burn.</P>

<P N="7">7. Parties aggrieved by an assessment may, by giving notice to the church-wardens, appeal to the next sessi∣ons of the peace, 17 Geo. 2. c. 38.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="63" REF="83"/>8. The goods of any person assessed, and refusing to pay, may be distrained by a justice's warrant; but the mode is to summon the party first, before a magistrate, to shew cause why he will not pay. Ibid.</P>

<P><PB N="69" REF="89"/>The conditions of the policy and agreement are, that the assurance shall be void, if the person whose life is assured shall depart the kingdom of Great Bri∣tain, or enter into the army or navy, without the pre∣vious consent of the company, or shall die by suicide, duelling, or the hand of justice.—This corporation does not grant any annuities on lives.</P>
<P N="3">3. The terms of assurance at the <HI>Amicable Society,</HI> Ser∣jeant's-inn, Fleet-street, are as follow:—</P>
<P>July 25, 1706, Queen Anne incorporated William, then Lord Bishop of Oxon, Sir Thomas Aleyn, Bart. and others, and every other person who should be then after admitted a subscriber, (not exceeding 2000 in the whole) by the name of the Amicable Society, with power to purchase and alien lands, not exceeding the yearly value of 2000 l. to acquire any goods and chat∣tels whatsoever, to sue, and be sued, and to have a com∣mon seal.</P>
<P>Every person afterwards admitted, is to be esteemed a member of the corporation, and is to pay on his and her own life 6 l. 4 s. per annum, in such manner as the directors of the said corporation, for the time be∣ing, shall think fit; on whose decease the nominee, &amp;c. is to be entitled to an equal share of 10,000 l. when there are 2000 subscribers, or of a sum in proportion, if the Society shall consist of a lesser number.</P>
<P>Twelve persons were appointed directors, with power for any seven, or more of them, to hold courts; and the major part of them assembled were to manage the affairs of the corporation according to the charter, and to the by-laws to be made by the major part of the members in a general court, which court may not con∣sist of less than twenty members; and for a succession of directors, twelve members (living within the bills of mortality) were to be chosen yearly, within forty days after Lady-day, to be directors for one year, and until others should be chosen in their places; and one of the members of the corporation was appointed re∣gister, to be succeeded, from time to time, by another member.</P>
<P>January 16, 1729, George II. granted additional
<PB N="70" REF="90"/>
powers and authorities as were not contained in the original charter.</P>
<P>No person can be admitted a member under the age of twelve, or above the age of forty-five years, (except in exchange) and persons above the age of forty-three are required to procure authentic certificates of their ages.</P>
<P>Persons in London, or within fifteen miles thereof, must appear before a court of directors, and there vo∣luntarily make oath, "That he or she is in a good state of health, and hath no distemper, which, accord∣ing to the best of his or her knowledge, judgement or belief, may tend to the shortening of his or her days."</P>
<P>Persons living above fifteen miles from London, and not appearing before a court of directors, may be ad∣mitted members (after they are upon enquiry other∣wise approved of) by certificates and affidavits.</P>
<P>Not more than three numbers or shares can be had upon any one life.</P>
<P>Every person, on admission, is to pay a premium of 7 l. 10 s. for each number or share, together with 7 s. 6 d. for the policy.</P>
<P>A dividend of 1 l. 4 s. is allowed to each member, out of the profits of the corporation, whereby the char∣ter payment of 6 l. 4 s. is reduced to 5 l. per annum, which 5 l. is to be paid quarterly, under certain pe∣nalties for every share.</P>
<P>The death of every member must be proved by cer∣tificate of burial; together with an affidavit of his or her death, and identity.</P>
<P>If a member dies out of England, security must be given to indemnify the corporation, before any claim is paid.</P>
<P>Any person above the age of forty-five, if in good health, may be admitted in exchange for a member who is older than himself.</P>
<P>By a resolution of the general court, the 10th day of May, 1770, the claims are not to be less than 150 l. upon each number or share; but they have been con∣siderably larger, as will appear by the following ac∣count:

<P>N. B. From the above specimen, which shews the premium for every tenth year, the reader will easi∣ly judge of the proportional premium for any in∣termediate age.</P>
<P>Every person desiring to make assurance with the so∣ciety, must sign a declaration by himself or agent, set∣ting forth the age, state of health, profession, occupa∣tion, and other circumstances of the persons whose lives are proposed to be assured: and also, in case such assurance is made upon the life of another person, that the interest which he has in such life is equal to the sum assured. This declaration is the basis of the con∣tract between the society and the person desirous to make such assurance: and if any artful, false, or frau∣dulent representation shall be used therein, all claim, on account of any policy so obtained, shall cease, de∣termine, and be void, and the monies which shall
<PB N="77" REF="97"/>
have been paid upon account of such assurance, shall be forfeited to the use of the society.</P>
<P>Every person making assurance with the society be∣comes a member, and enters into a covenant that he will conform to, observe, and keep the statutes, bye-laws, rules, orders, and ordinances of the society.— But no member has a right to vote at a general court, who is not assured in the sum of 100 l. or upwards, upon a life or lives, for the whole continuance there∣of.</P>
<P>The business of the society is conducted and carried on by fifteen directors, annually chosen out of those members, who are assured with the society in the sum of 300 l. or upwards, upon a life or lives, for the whole continuance thereof.</P>
<P>Four general courts are held every year, on the first Thursday of March, June, September and December, or as often as nine members qualified to vote shall think proper, at which times the accounts and state of the society are laid before the persons present.</P>
<P>If at any time it shall appear to a General Court of the Society, that the premiums received, and to be received, will not be sufficient to pay the claims, then the General Court are to direct a call to be made upon the several members of the Society, in proportion to the sums by them assured, for making good the defi∣ciency; for which call credit is to be given, and the call afterwards to be repaid; with interest, at the rate of 3 per cent.</P>
<P>If a call should at any time be requisite, (which is highly improbable) the members assured for a single year will be rated towards such call in the proportion of one sixth part, and the members assured for a number of years certain, in the proportion of two third parts of the sum charged upon the members assured for the whole continuance of life, for every 100 l. by them respectively assured.</P>
<P>As often as it shall appear to a General Court, that the stock of the Society is more than sufficient to pay the claims liable to be made, then the General Court is to declare a dividend of the surplus, or of such part thereof as shall be judged convenient, amongst the
<PB N="78" REF="98"/>
members of the society liable to contribute towards a call in proportion to the sums in which they are assu∣red, and to the number of years of their standing in the society.</P>
<P>The court of directors are impowered to assure either a gross sum, or an annuity, to be paid to children after they shall have attained an age assigned.</P>
<P>The court of directors are impowered to assure an∣nuities for a life or lives, on the payment of a gross sum.</P>
<P>So as the amount of any annuity or annuities to be granted upon any <HI>one</HI> life do not exceed one hundred pounds:</P>
<P>And towards securing the payment of the several annuities, a fund is reserved of two-thirds of the sums originally paid for the purchase.</P>
<P>There are two or three other societies for assurance on lives, that pay annuities to widows and children, but they are not sufficiently established to put any great dependence on them, of course they are not here no∣ticed.</P>

<P N="2">2. Letters to be sent out of town must be put into these offices before ten at night, to be forwarded by the first delivery the next day.</P>
<P N="3">3. To prevent the frequent delays of Penny-post let∣ters, the public are requested to be particularly careful to send them to the Penny-post receiving-houses, from whence they are collected every four hours, and deli∣vered four times a day to all parts of London; for when they are put by mistake into the General Post-office, or the receiving-houses for general-post letters, they cannot be collected till late in the evening, and besides the delay thereby, the penny which ought to have been paid with them must of necessity be charged to the per∣sons they are directed to.</P>
<P N="4">4. Letters are much accelerated by being put in at any of the five principal offices, instead of the receiv∣ing-houses, from whence they must be collected and sent to those offices.</P>
<P N="5">5. For the port of every letter or packet, passing or repassing within the cities of London or Westminster, the Borough of Southwark and their suburbs, (which letter or packet is not to exceed the weight of 4 ounces▪

unless coming from or passing to the General-Post) one penny upon putting in the same, as also a penny upon the delivery of such as are directed to any place beyond the said cities, borough, or suburbs, within the district of the penny-post delivery.</P>
<P N="6">6. The triangular stamp on all Penny-post letters shews the day they are brought to one of these princi∣pal offices; and the round stamp the hour they are gi∣ven to the letter carriers.</P>
<P N="7">7. This post carries parcels under four ounces to most places within ten miles of London.</P>
<P N="8">8. To expedite the delivery, it is adviseable to write on the outside, the day of the week, and the hour the letter is put into the office.</P>
<P N="9">9. If you send any thing of value by the post, it is proper that the person who delivers it at the office should be able to prove the contents; but the office has given the following directions concerning this mat∣ter. Unless letters containing things of value be left open, to be so carried to one of the five principal offi∣ces above-mentioned, there to be seen and entered, the letter-carrier will no ways be made answerable for their miscarriage.</P>
<P N="10">10. Those who send bank-notes by the post, are ad∣vised by the post-office to cut them in two pieces, ob∣liquely, so as to have the words on the left, as below, in one piece, and those on the right in the other, and send them at two different times, one half at one time and one at another, as a security, in case the mail is robbed.</P>

<P N="12">12. Nothing above four ounces will be conveyed by the penny-post, except passing to or from the general post-office.</P>

<P N="3">3. Coachmen, if left to themselves, can charge only for the nearest way, go which way they will, unless the nearest road is stopped.</P>
<P N="4">4. Coachmen may chuse whether they will be paid for the time or the ground; the ground they go is to be measured from the stand from whence they are called.</P>
<P N="5">5. If a coach is on the stand, the driver is obliged to go with his fare at any hour, not exceeding ten miles from London, under the penalty of 40 s.</P>
<P N="6">6. No coachman need take in more than four; but if he takes five without making terms, he can take no more than his usual fare.</P>
<P N="7">7. If he is insolent, he will be fined from 10 s. to 40 s. but generally 40 s.</P>
<P N="8">8. Every coachman is obliged to have a check string, which he is to hold in his hand as he drives, and to en∣ter the coach, so as to stop him without calling, or for∣feit 5 s.</P>
<P N="9">9. Coachmen are obliged to trot their horses, except up hill.</P>
<P N="10">10. If a coachman takes more than his fare, he for∣feits 10 s.</P>
<P N="11">11. If a coach breaks down with you, you may re∣fuse to pay the fare.</P>
<P N="12">12. If you think, when paying him, he asks too much, tender what he asks, and bid him, at his peril, take more than his fare; then take his number, which is fixed on the coach-door, and, on application to a justice of peace, or to the commissioners of the Hack∣ney-coach office, who sit every Friday, at twelve, at the office in Somerset-place, you may obtain redress. The latter is the best place to appl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to, as the coach-office is acquainted with the measur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of all the streets: and when you have made your complaint, if he has

taken more than his fare, they will summon him to meet you there on the next day of sitting, and on your swearing to the offence, he will be fined, and the com∣missioners will give you half the penalty; if he has taken no more than his fare you will be told so, when you call again, and that he is not summoned; but this is not attended with any expence. <HI>Note,</HI> Half the pe∣nalties are given to the informer.</P>

<P N="17">17. If they insult you, the penalty is 40 s.</P>
<P N="18">18. Act as with coachmen, take the number of the chair, which is fixed just under the the top, near the hinge, and complain at the hackney-coach office, as above: if they are fined, half the fine will be given to you. No expence to you if they are not fined.</P>
<P N="19">19.

<HEAD>PORTERS.</HEAD>
<P>AT the west end of the town there are no regula∣tions among porters; chairmen are chiefly em∣ployed in carrying goods and going of errands. See CHAIRMEN, No. 18. Chairmen are very unreasonable in their demands, they will not go a hundred yards with a letter for less than sixpence, and if they go a mile they expect a shilling. But in the city they are under very good regulations.</P>
<P>The city porters are divided into brotherhoods, and consist of four sorts, viz. Ticket Porters, Fellowship Porters, Tackle Porters, and Companies Porters.</P>

If any dispute arise between the employer and the carman about the distance of ground that goods have been carried, or the weight of the goods, either party is to apply to the Lord Mayor, or any justice of the peace of the city; and the ground shall be measur∣ed by some person to be appointed for that purpose by the Lord Mayor, and any such justice to whom such application shall be made. And if a dispute arises con∣cerning the weight of the goods carried, the same shall be weighed, if it can conveniently be done, and the party in default shall pay all such expences as shall be ascertained to be reasonable by the magistrate before whom the parties shall have been heard.</P>
<P N="5">5. Any person may chuse what cart he pleases to em∣ploy in his work (except such as stand for wharf-work, tackle-work, and crane-work, which are to stand in order, and to be taken in turn). And that every car∣man
<PB N="110" REF="130"/>
who stands with his empty cart next to any goods that are to be laden, being first in turn, shall, on the first demand, load the same without any delay, or bar∣gaining for any other pay than is hereby appointed. And if the first, or any other cart, shall refuse to work, or delay to load any goods, upon request made for that purpose, every person so refusing or delaying shall for∣feit for every such offence the sum of 10 s. and the driver of the next cart in order, who will carry the goods, shall be at liberty to take the same: and if any carman shall refuse so to do, he or they so refusing shall forfeit and pay, for every time he or they shall so of∣fend, the sum of 10 s. And if any employer shall re∣fuse to employ the next cart in order at wharf-work, tackle-work, and crane-work, he shall forfeit and lose the sum of 10 s.</P>
<P N="6">6. All the wharfs between London-Bridge and the Temple to be used in turn-keeping, as the custom is below bridge.</P>
<P N="7">7. The carman who is first in the morning at any of the said wharfs shall have the first load, he having his horse in the cart, and giving attendance for his la∣bour; and if absent, then to take the other whose turn is next; and whosoever refuseth to load, shall forfeit and pay, for every time he shall so offend, 10 s.</P>
<P N="8">8. No carman shall come to any of the wharfs be∣tween the Bridge and Tower-wharf before four in the morning in summer, and seven in winter, unless a mer∣chant has extraordinary occasion for his coming sooner, under the penalty of 5 s.</P>
<P N="9">9. No owner or driver of any cart for hire in Lon∣don, &amp;c. shall demand or take for his fare, for the car∣riage of any goods within the distance prescribed by the act of parliament, more money than by the above rates are limited for the same, or as shall be appointed by any subsequent rules made in pursuance of the said act of parliament. And if any such owner or driver of any cart or car shall misbehave himself therein, or shall refuse to come with his car when called to be hir∣ed, or to take in loading into his car or cart, or shall utter any abusive language, or offer any insult to his employer or employers, their servants or agents, he or
<PB N="111" REF="131"/>
they so offending in any of the cases aforesaid, shall forfeit, for every time he offends, 20 s.</P>
<P N="10">10. The driver of every cart within the distance be∣fore mentioned, shall assist in loading and unloading the goods, wares and merchandises into and out of the same; and if he shall refuse so to do, his employers may retain out of his fare what any other person shall be reasonably paid for assisting in his stead to load or unload the same, and the sum of 2 s. 6 d. besides, by way of penalty; and in case of any difference about the same, some justice of peace within the said limits shall ascertain the sum to be so paid.</P>
<P N="11">11. Every owner of a cart, which shall be worked for hire within the distances before mentioned, shall have his name placed in full length, painted in large capital letters, not less than three inches long, and broad in proportion, on some conspicuous part of the front of his cart or car; and shall from time to time take care to continue and keep the same there, so as always to appear plain and legible. And on the alteration of the property of any cart, the new owner is, in like man∣ner, to cause his name to be forthwith put and kept thereon. And if any owner shall omit to have his name on his cart, in manner aforesaid, or any one shall drive for hire a cart in London, &amp;c. without the real owner's name in manner aforesaid thereon, or if any one shall wilfully obliterate or alter the figure or num∣ber of any cart, or the name of any carman, which shall have been painted on his cart or car, every person on being convicted thereof before the Lord Mayor or any justice of the peace in London, shall, for every such offence, forfeit 20 s.</P>
<P N="12">12. All carts, during the time of loading and un∣loading thereof, within the streets of the city of Lon∣don, and the liberties thereof, shall stand sideways the long way of the street, and not cross the same, and as close to the side of the street where they are loading and unloading as they can, so as passengers and coaches, and other carts may pass by, if the street is of sufficient width to allow two carriages to pass to∣gether therein (except where the situation of the place, or the package of the goods, makes it necessary
<PB N="112" REF="132"/>

And if any carman shall stand in any street with his cart, not being loading o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> unloading goods, every such carman shall draw away immediately at the request of any person, to let such person or any carriage pass by, if the street will allow thereof, under the penalty that every one offending in the premisses shall, for every time he or they shall so offend therein, in any of the cases in this order men∣tioned, forfeit 10 s.</P>
<P N="13">13. No person under the age of 16 years shall be employed to drive or manage horses in carts, under the penalty of 20 s. to be paid by the owners of every such cart or car, every time any person under the age of 16 shall be convicted before any justice in London, of driving any horse in any cart in London.</P>
<P N="14">14. Every cart shall be allowed to contain in length, between the tug-hole and the fore-ear breadth, six feet six inches, and no more; and in breadth, between the two raves in the body of the cart, four feet ten inches of assize, and no more; and in length, from the fore-ear breadth to the end of the cart, seven feet and one inch, and no more. And if any cart shall at any time be worked in London of greater length or breadth, the same may be seized and sent to the green-yard, and the owner thereof shall, for every such offence, forfeit 20 s.</P>
<P N="15">15. If the driver of any cart shall leave his cart in the street or common passage of the city by night, he shall forfeit for every time 5 s. besides making such re∣compence to the party who shall sustain damage there∣by, as any justice of the peace in London shall direct.</P>
<P N="16">16. If the driver of any cart shall feed his horses in the street, save with oats out of a bag, or with such hay as he shall hold in his hands, or in a basket, or leave his cart and horses in the street, without some person to look after the same, the owner of every cart shall, for every such offence, forfeit 5 s.</P>
<P N="17">17. If the driver of any cart or car shall suffer the horses in his cart to trot in the street, or shall drive them in a speedier course than his cart is usually drove when loaded, he shall forfeit, for every such offence. 10 s.</P>
<P N="18"><PB N="113" REF="133"/>18. If the driver of any cart for hire in London, or the liberties thereof, shall not, from time to time, lead his thill-horse by the head, with an halter not longer than five feet, he shall forfeit and pay, for every time he shall offend, 5 s.</P>
<P N="19">19. The driver of every empty cart in London shall, from time to time, give way to a loaded carriage, and to a coach, &amp;c. under the penalty of 20 s. for every offence.</P>

<P N="21">21. If any one shall refuse to pay the owner or dri∣ver of the cart employed the money justly due for his fare, or shall in any wise abuse the carman, or misbe∣have towards him, the Lord Mayor, or any justice in London, on application of the carman to him, shall cause the parties to come before him, and examine, from time to time, into the matter complained of, and thereupon make such order of payment of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and recompensing the carman for his loss of time, and for any injury he shall have sustained, and any expen∣ces he shall have been at, as shall be just; and the par¦ty found in default shall thereupon forthwith pay the money ordered to be paid by such magistrate, under the penalty of 5 l.</P>
<P N="22">22. If any one shall cause the driver of any cart to wait above half an hour for the loading of any goods into the same, or unloading of goods thereout (the car∣man being willing to help to load or unload the same) he or they so offending shall pay for the same forth∣with to the carman, after the rate of 6 d. for every half hour, from the expiration of the first half hour, which the cart shall be detained.</P>
<P N="23">23. No carman shall be compellable to carry any load of goods above three miles from the city and li∣berties

<P N="24">24. In case the owner of any cart worked in Lon∣don for hire shall not deliver up, to be brought before a magistrate, any driver thereof, charged with any of∣fence against any of the rules or orders aforesaid, with∣in seven days after complaint made to any magistrate against any such driver, and notice thereof given or left at the usual place of abode of the owner of any such cart, then the owner of every such cart shall be liable to answer and pay the penalty incurred by any such driver; and if the driver shall be afterwards found, and shall not make satisfaction forthwith to his master, for what he shall have paid for any such dri∣ver's misbehaviour, neglect or default, every such dri∣ver shall forfeit 5 l. for every such default.</P>
<P N="25">25. The Lord Mayor of the city, or any justice of the peace of the said city, before whom any offender shall be brought, and be convicted, may lessen, miti∣gate, or remit, any of the said penalties, so as not to remit above one-half of the penalty inflicted for the offence.</P>
<P N="26">26. All penalties by these orders, or any of them inflicted, shall be levied by distress and sale of the of∣fender's goods, by warrant under the hand and seal of the justices of the peace. One moiety of all penalties and forfeitures is to be paid to the person who shall prosecute to conviction any person who shall break the said orders, and the other moiety to the overseers of the poor, if there shall be any, of the parish or place in which the offence shall be so committed, or the of∣fender shall have been apprehended.</P>

<HEAD>ON WALKING LONDON STREETS.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. IN walking through London, you may always find your way, if, before you set out, you will con∣sult a map of London, and attend to the names of the streets and courts, which are always painted on a board against the houses, at the corner of each street or court.</P>
<P N="2">2. If you wish to walk safe, never pass under any goods, &amp;c. that are drawing up to the top of a house by a crane, nor pass a house where the bricklayers are at work, lest any thing should fall on your head; it is adviseable, on such occasions, to cross the way: and if you would save your clothes, never pass under a lamp, whilst the lamp-lighter is triming it, nor go near any rails, &amp;c. fresh painted; or contest the way with a baker, barber, chimney-sweeper, barrow-woman, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3">3. If the wall or houses are on your right hand, keep the wall and you will have no interruption, every one will give way.</P>
<P N="4">4. But don't dispute the wall with a cart or carriage, lest you should be crushed.</P>
<P N="5">5. Never stop in a crowd, or to look at the windows of a print-shop or shew-glass, if you would not have your pocket picked.</P>
<P N="6">6. Do not walk under a pent-house, lest persons watering flower-pots, or other slops, should drop upon your head.</P>
<P N="7">7. Be careful, if you meet a porter carrying a load upon his head, that you do not get a blow that may be fatal.</P>
<P N="8">8. If you walk with an umbrella, and meet a similar machine, lower yours in time, lest you either break it, or get entangled with the other.</P>
<P N="9">9 One side of the way is generally shady; it is not necessary perhaps to recommend crossing to the shady side in sultry weather, or keeping to windward when the dust flies.</P>
<P N="10">10. In wet weather look where you step; if you would not be splashed, don't tread on a loose stone.</P>
<P N="11"><PB N="116" REF="136"/>11. Don't hastily cross a street when a coach is com∣ing up, lest your foot should slip and you be run over.</P>
<P N="12">12. In frosty weather it is adviseable to walk in the coach-ways, which are not so slippery as the foot-paths; and to bind a piece of cloth-list round one of your shoes, it will save you many a fall.</P>
<P N="13">13. It is very dangerous walking in a thick fog, as you cannot see the danger before you; people who walk in London should always look before them, both above and below.</P>
<P N="14">14. It would be prudent for the men to have their coat-pockets open in the lining within; this will often prevent them from being picked. At least every one should attend to his pocket at night, or as he passes a crowd.</P>

<P N="11">11. The price of post-chaises in London is generally 1 s. a mile, exclusive of the duty, and they generally charge a mile or two more, the first stage, than the ground measures, under a pretence of the ground on the stones.

<P>A Man may live like a gentleman in London at a very easy rate, and have every indulgence he can wish for.</P>
<P N="1">1. If he does not keep a carriage, he may hire one by the month, or week, or even by the day. A genteel coach, with glass windows, may be hired for the day, of those who keep hackney-coaches, if bespoke, at the price of a hackney-coach, and if you have a great-coat

<P N="2">2. Hackney-chairs may be had at a moment's notice, paying them either for the time or ground they go, ac∣cording to the customary rates, or by the week; and if you have two great coats and hats to lend the men for the time, they may be always well equipped. For la∣dies, a lady's chair should be kept in the hall, it pays no duty. These chairmen in constant pay will call three or four times a day for orders, and will go on mes∣sages also.</P>

<P N="7">7. The London Library, Ludgate-hill, is an institu∣tion of late date, but likely to be a very valuable one. It consists at present of 140 subscribers, twelve of whom are a committee, and sit once a week, on Tues∣days, to determine on the purchase of books, &amp;c. which any subscriber may recommend to their consi∣deration. They do not buy all the trash that is pub∣lished, but books of character, and such as are worth reading, French or English, with the foreign Reviews, &amp;c. it being the design of this Library to contain all those great works of science which it is difficult for in∣dividuals to procure, and every other work of taste and entertainment.</P>
<P>Any person paying one guinea entrance, and one guinea per annum, becomes a member of the society, and has an interest in the property of the whole.</P>
<P>Any person paying ten guineas si a member for life.</P>
<P>The Library is opened every day, Sundays ex∣cepted, from March 25, to September 29, from eleven to four, and from five to eight; and from Sep∣tember 29 to March 25, from eleven to four only; du∣ring which time the members may consult any books, or send for them to their own houses. A reading-room and a fire in winter.</P>
<P>Every member may have two books at a time, in his or her possession; the time of keeping which is regu∣lated by the committee, as follows:—A folio six weeks, a quarto one month, and an octavo a week; keeping them beyond the time is a forfeit of a trifle to the fund.</P>
<P>If any books be lost or damaged, that book, or the set, if it belongs to a set, must be re-placed by the per∣son to whom it was delivered.</P>

<HEAD>ON GOING TO PUBLICK WORSHIP.</HEAD>
<P>I Believe, in this degenerate age, the best method of inducing people to attend the service of the church, is to point out to them the penalties they are liable to for non-attendance, and to shew them how much they lie at the mercy of an ill-natured neighbour or a mer∣cenary informer.</P>
<P N="1">1. All persons, having no lawful or reasonable ex∣cuse for being absent, shall resort to their parish church or chapel, or, upon reasonable let thereof, to some usual place where divine service shall be performed, according to the liturgy and practice of the church of England, upon every Sunday and holiday, on pain of punishment by the censures of the church, or of for∣feiting 1 s. for every offence to the poor, to be levied by the churchwardens by distress. 1 Eliz. c. 2. Ex∣cept Dissenters tolerated. 1 W. c. 18. Prosecution to be in one month after default. 3 J. c. 4.</P>
<P N="2">2. And he who is absent from his own parish church shall be put to prove, where he went to church. 1 Haw 13.</P>
<P N="3">3. Every person above the age of sixteen years, who shall not repair to some church, chapel, or usual place of common prayer, on conviction, shall fofeit 20 l. a month, one third to him who shall sue. 23 Eliz. c. 1.</P>
<P N="4">4. And this penalty of 20 l. a month dispenseth not with the forfeiture of 12 d. a Sunday. 1 Haw. 13.</P>
<P N="5">5. And every offender in not repairing to divine service, having been once convicted (and not conform∣ing) shall pay 20 l. a month into the Exchequer, in the term of Easter or Michaelmas, next after such convic∣tion, and also shall, without any other indictment or conviction, for every month after such conviction, so long as he shall not conform, pay as much as shall then remain unpaid, after such rate of 20 l. a month; and, in default of any part of such payments, the King may by process seize all the goods and two parts of the land of such offender. 29 Eliz. c. 6. 3 J. c. 4.</P>
<P N="6">6. Or the King may refuse the 20 l. a month, though
<PB N="128" REF="148"/>
duly tendered, and seize two parts of the lands at his option. 3 Jac. c. 4.</P>
<P N="7">7. But copyhold lands are not within the statute, 1 Haw. 14.</P>
<P N="8">8. And every person who shall usually on Sundays have in his ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se divine service as established by law, and be thereat himself usually present, and shall four times a year go to the parish church, or other common church or chapel, shall not incur any penalty for not repairing to church. 23 Eliz c. 1.</P>
<P N="9">9. But this shall not extend to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alified Protestant dissenters, who resort to some place of religious wor∣ship allowed by the act of toleration. 1 W c. 18.</P>
<P N="10">10. Every person who shall retain in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> service, or shall relieve, keep, or harbour in his ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se, any ser∣vant, sojourner, or stranger, who shall n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> repair to church, but shall forbear for a month together, not ha∣ving reasonable excuse, shall forfeit 10 l. for every month he shall continue in his house such person so for∣bearing. 3 J. c. 4.</P>
<P N="11">11. No recusant convict (that is a person once con∣victed and not conforming) shall practice law or phy∣sic, nor shall be judge or minister of any court, or have any military office by sea or land, and shall forfeit for every offence 100 l. 3 J. c. 5.</P>
<P N="12">12. And the church-wardens and constables shall (on pain of 20 l.) present at the quarter-sessions, once a year, the monthly absence from church of all re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>usants, and the names and ages of their children above nine years of age, and the names of their servants. And if the party presented shall be indicted and convicted, such church-warden or constable shall have a reward of 40s. to be levied on the recusant's goods. 3 J. c. 4.</P>
<P N="13">13. It is difficult for new comers in to any parish to obtain a pew in the parish church: but churches are seldom so full but they may find a seat in the pew, of others. Indeed the pew openers, for a shilling now and then given them, will sea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a person commodiously.</P>
<P N="14">14. But at the private chapels about town, a pew to hold six may be rented for about 5 l. or 6 l. a year, or one person may be seated agreeable to his wishes for
<PB N="129" REF="149"/>
20 s. a year, and at these places there are generally ce∣lebrated preachers.</P>
<P N="15">15. In order to obtain a pew in any of the parish churches, application must be made to the church-war∣dens for the time being.</P>

IF the driver of any cart, car, dray or waggon, shall ride upon any carriage in a street or high∣way, not having some person on foot or horseback to guide the same (such carriages excepted, as are con∣ducted by some person holding the reins of the horses drawing the same); or if the driver of such carriage shall, by negligence or wilful misbehaviour, cause any hurt or damage to any person or carriage, in such street or highway, or shall wilfully be at such a distance, or in such a situation, whilst it shall be passing on the highway, that he cannot have the government of his horses, or shall wilfully or negligently obstruct the free passage of any other carriage; or if the driver of any empty or unloaded waggon, cart or carriage, shall re∣fuse to make way for any coach, chariot, chaise, load∣ed waggon, cart or loaded carriage; or if any person shall drive any coach, post-chaise, or carriage let for hire, or waggon, wain or cart, not having the owner's name, as required, painted thereon, or shall refuse to discover the christian and sirname of the owner, every such offender shall forfeit a sum not exceeding 10 s. (or not exceeding 20 s. if the driver of the said car∣riage be the owner); and in default of payment, the offender shall be committed to the house of correction, for a time not exceeding one month, unless such for∣feiture be sooner paid. And any person may appre∣hend such driver, without a warrant, and deliver him to a constable, to be conveyed before a magistrate; and if such driver shall refuse to tell his name, the justice may commit him for a time not exceeding three months, and may proceed against him for the penalty nevertheless. 13 Geo. 3. c. 84.</P>

<P N="4">4. Assaulting in the street or highway, with intent to spoil people's clothes, and so spoiling them, is fe∣lony and transportation. 6 Geo. c. 23.</P>
<P N="5">5. A person may justify an assault in defence of his person, his wife, his master, parent or child, within age, and even a wounding in defence of his person, but not of his possession. 3 Salk. 46.</P>
<P N="6">6. A person may justify an assault of another who menaces him, or assaults him, and attempts to beat him from his lawful water-course or highway. Pult. 48.</P>
<P N="7">7. Likewise, if a person comes into my house, and will not go out, I may justify laying hold of him and turning him out. Nels. Assault.</P>
<P N="8">8. Where a man is assaulted, and hath not witnesses to prove the same, the party assaulted may bring an in∣formation in the Crown-office, in which case, the of∣fence being indicted at the suit of the king, the party grieved may be admitted an evidence. 4 &amp; 5 W. &amp; M. c. 18.</P>
<P>But by this mode of process, the party grieved can only punish the offender corporally, he cannot recover damages</P>
<P N="9">9. If a man strikes you, the most summary method of punishing him, is to have a warrant for him, and take him before a magistrate, where he must make sa∣tisfaction, or be bound over to the sessions.</P>
<P N="10">10. No words whatever can amount to an assault, but any injury done to the person of a man, in an an∣gry insolent manner, be it ever so small, is actionable; for example, spitting in his face, jostling him, treading on his toes, or any way touching him in anger. Ibid. Even offering to strike, or threatening with any staff or weapon, is an assault in law. Lamb libel.</P>
<P N="11">11. Where a man is threatened to be beaten, or can swear that he goes in fear of his life, he may, before a justice, bind his advetsary over to keep the peace.— 1 Haw. 126. Crom. 118.</P>

If not known, they may be found out by following them home.</P>
<P N="13">13. The constable of the district, on the information in writing, of two inhabitants paying scot and lot, of any body keeping a bawdy-house, gaming-house, or any other disorderly house in such parish, must go forthwith, with such inhabitants, before a justice, and on their making oath that they believe the same to be true, &amp;c. and entering into a recognizance of 20 l. each, to produce evidence against such person for such offence, the constable must enter into a recognizance of 30 l. to prosecute, on pain of forfeiting 20 l. to such inhabitant as gave him the notice. He shall be paid all expences attending the same by the overseers of the poor. 28 Geo. 2.</P>

<PB N="146" REF="166"/>
<HEAD><HI>Sundry</HI> CAUTIONS <HI>against</HI> ROBBERIES, FRAUDS, IMPOSITIONS <HI>and</HI> INSULTS.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. PERSONS travelling to or from London should be careful not to take too much money with them. Bank post-bills, made payable to the holder or order, is the safest conveyance; for these are of no va∣lue till indorsed by the person they are made payable to; and if lost, as the bank does not pay them till seven days after sight, there is time to give notice of the loss.</P>
<P N="2">2. Trunks, &amp;c. should not be fastened behind car∣riages, unless with chains, or unless servants ride be∣hind, and will attend to them till they are ten or twelve miles from the metropolis; for there are thieves fre∣quently waiting at the outskirts of the town, particular∣ly in the evening, to cut such luggage from behind.</P>
<P N="3">3. If trunks, boxes, or packages are to be sent by coaches or waggons into the country, it is prudent to let some person be present at the packing up, as a wit∣ness of the contents, and to take a list of what the trunk, &amp;c. contains. This person should then take it to the warehouse of the coach or waggon himself, and deliver it to the book-keeper, see it booked, and pay for the booking, which is 2 d. In this case, if it be lost, you will be able to prove the contents, and reco∣ver the value from the owner of the coach or waggon. See STAGE-COACHES, 2.</P>
<P N="4">4. But let your servant be very careful not to leave the trunk, &amp;c. with any person standing at the door of the inn, or in the inn-yard; but to enquire for the book-keeper, and not part with his load till he can de∣liver it into the custody of the book-keeper, and see it booked. On this account the porter should be able to read writing, to know what he is about. Rogues are very often about inn-yards, to case such messengers of their loads.</P>
<P N="5">5. Such persons as you send with parcels from one part of the town to another, should be cautioned not to be led into a public house by the way, to drink with any supposed countryman, nor to suffer any good-na∣tured
<PB N="147" REF="167"/>
person in the street, to give them a hand and help them on the way with their bundle or load; for there are many of these obliging people in London streets, that when they get possession of the bundle, &amp;c. will run away with it.</P>
<P N="6">6. If you hire a basket-woman at market, or a porter to carry any thing for you home, which you may have bought, tell such person where they are to carry it, and make them walk before you all the way. Your eye will then be upon them, and if they slip away from you it will he your own fault. If it be inconvenient to attend them, employ no such person but whom you know, or is known to the person with whom you deal. But if you buy of a shop-keeper, they will always send the goods home.</P>
<P N="7">7. Never stop in a crowd in the streets, to see what occasions it: if you do, it is two to one but you either lose your watch or your pocket-handkerchief. There are fellows who create disturbances for this purpose.</P>
<P N="8">8. Never carry any bank-notes or bills about you, without first entering, in some book at home, the num∣ber and date, and particulars of such notes, that in case you lose them, or your pocket is picked of your book, you stand some chance of recovering them, or stop the payment.</P>
<P N="9">9. Also enter, in some book at home, the number, maker's name, &amp;c. and description of your watch, and whatever else of value you carry about you, that you may know how to describe it, if lost.</P>
<P N="10">10. Never part with such articles out of your hands, to persons you are unacquainted with.</P>
<P N="11">11. If you would walk safe, you would always avoid crowds, stopping to look at the pictures in a print-shop, &amp;c. See p. 115, No. 5, 14.</P>
<P N="12">12. If by chance you should drop any thing of va∣lue in the street, whilst you are looking for it, you will have many ask you what you have lost, and offer to assist you in the search. Tell them it is nothing of any consequence: if you acquaint them, you are likely never to find it, as they will probably find it for you and keep it.</P>
<P N="13"><PB N="148" REF="168"/>13. Give directions to your servants, on no condi∣tion to deliver any thing from your house to a stranger, under a pretence of your having sent for it; for in∣stance, a great coat or any other thing: there are al∣ways villains ready to take advantage of their igno∣rance.</P>
<P N="14">14. For the same reason, never let them take in a parcel for you, under an idea that it came by such a carriage, if they are to pay any thing for it; for such packages have been sound to contain nothing but brick∣bats, &amp;c. In short, never let them pay any thing without your knowledge or order so to do, to any one. Persons bringing things will often take the money be∣fore hand, and ask for it again at the house they carry it to.</P>
<P N="15">15. Before you get into a hackney-coach or chair, always take the number, as, if you leave any thing therein, you may then, by summoning the coachman, or chairman, to the Hackney-coach office, probably re∣cover it. They may say they never saw it, and pos∣sibly their next fare might find it and take it: possibly so. This is a lie, for they always look, when they set down a fare, before they shut the door. To be truly safe in this matter, every one should look round the coach or chair before they quit it.</P>
<P N="16">16. Thieves have lately made a practice of knock∣ing at doors in an evening, under a pretence of deli∣vering a letter, and, when the door is open, if in a retired place, have rushed in, in numbers, and robbed the family. To avoid this, a chain should be always put across the door within, (so as to admit the door to open a little way) before dusk, and the door not open∣ed to a stranger, but the letter, if any, taken in.</P>
<P N="17">17. If you do not sit in your front-parlour in an evening, take care the windows are fastened down, for men have been known to enter a house this way, secrete themselves till the family is asleep, and then rob the house; or they have robbed that room only, while the family have been backwards, and decamped the same way.</P>
<P N="18">18. If the house next door to you is empty, be cau∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous and fasten your back-doors, and inside-shutters of
<PB N="149" REF="169"/>
the upper windows; for villains will now and then se∣crete themselves in such empty houses, and, in the night, get into the adjoining house, by the back-doors or windows, or from the leads. Your garret-windows therefore should always be secured, and trap-doors opening to the leads well bolted.</P>
<P N="19">19. Before you come out of any play-house, or place of public entertainment, take care to secure your watch and your pockets, for pick-pockets are always about at such places.</P>
<P N="20">20. Never suffer any beggars to be begging at your door, particularly if you live in any retired place, for, under a pretence of begging, if they see no one in the way, they will be sure to rob you of something.</P>
<P N="21">21. Do not suffer yourself to be imposed on by beg∣gars in the streets, for they have all their arts, and will affect distress to excite your humanity; if you have any thing to give, it would be best bestowed to poor dis∣tressed families; it is a mistaken charity to give to beg∣gars in the streets, whom the laws have provided for.</P>
<P N="22">22. Auctions in great thorough-fares, in the day-time, where men stand at the door and invite passen∣gers, are great impositions. Slight ill-made goods are made up for such auctions, and if you buy, it is ten to one but you are cheated, and give twice the value of the article purchased. Never buy at an auction, but where the auctioneer is known to be a reputable man. At auctions of linen-drapery, they will put, perhaps, sufficient painted muslin for a gown, and a piece of dowlas, worth 7 d. a yard, and sell the two at one price per yard; from an opinion that there may not be above thirty yards of dowlas, you bid accordingly, but, when measured, there shall be sixty, of course you are deceived and cheated.</P>
<P N="23">23. For the same reason, never buy at a pawn-brokers such articles as they display at their windows; for a notion of buying things cheap, has drawn many to buy at these places; and this has led the pawn-bro∣kers to get things made up purposely for sale, in a slight manner. Half the things at their windows are new, and sold as second-hand.</P>
<P N="24"><PB N="150" REF="170"/>24. Indeed, in purchasing, it will be always sound best to purchase of, and employ people of credit, though you pay rather a greater price, for they have a cha∣racter at stake, and will use you well, in hopes of hav∣ing your custom in future; but if you buy in general of those who undersell the fair trader, and advertise things at a very low price, depend upon it, unless you are a very good judge of the articles you buy, and take especial care, you will be taken in.</P>
<P N="25">25. People in distress are always wanting to borrow money, and hold out advantageous terms in advertise∣ments to lenders. Be ever on your guard in this mat∣ter, and also against those who publicly, by adver∣tisement, offer to raise money on securities. They will get the securities into their hands, such as bonds, notes, &amp;c. and will frequently shuffle you out of them. To these the public have given the denomination of swindlers. If you are in trade, be cautious how you are taken in by customers you are a stranger to. There are a number of people in town, who live by getting goods on credit, and taking in the incautious shop-keeper.</P>
<P N="26">26. Be very circumspect and cautious of having any thing to do with notes of hand or accepted drafts, drawn by people you are unacquainted with, for it is by such modes that the unwary are duped and robbed of their property.</P>
<P N="27">27. If you keep an open shop, never suffer a stran∣ger to leave a parcel in your shop, (under a pretence of having further to go, and wishing it to be taken care of till his return) unless you know the contents of the parcel. Men have been known to leave contraband goods, in this manner, and go and inform against the shop-keeper, in order to get the penalty. In like manner, a sack of unroasted coffee has been left at a grocer's, and he has been exchequered in consequence of it.</P>
<P N="28">28. Never step in between persons quarrelling in the street, unless you chuse to have your pocket picked. These are often sham-quarrels, to collect people toge∣ther for the opportunity of plundering them.</P>
<P N="29"><PB N="151" REF="171"/>29. Any one may arrest a felon, even without a warrant.</P>
<P N="30">30. Where persons, by fraud in gaming, win above 10 l. they shall forfeit five times the value, and suffer such corporal punishment as in cases of wilful perjury. 9 Ann. c. 14.</P>
<P N="31">31. Shop-keepers should be on their guard against persons coming in and looking over a great quantity of goods, without purchasing. Sharpers often, making a genteel appearance, will take an opportunity, on these occasions, when the shop-keeper's back is turned, to pilser and purloin.</P>
<P N="32">32. In return, buyers should always be careful that they are not imposed on by shop-keepers, for they will often survey you from head to foot, and ask a price ac∣cording to their customer. They will often ask 10 s. for an article at a coach-side, which they will sell for, to a person on foot, for half the money.</P>
<P N="33">33. Shop-keepers who have the reputation of sel∣ling cheap, will evidently do so, in some small articles, the price of which every buyer is acquainted with; but they take care to bring up the <HI>lee-way,</HI> as the sea∣man's phrase is, and make you pay handsomely in other things. In short, every tradesman must live, and there are such numbers of the same profession in Lon∣don, that they are obliged to make use of a variety of artifices to get custom; and the buyer, with all his cle∣verness and care, shall not often be able to avoid being taken in.</P>
<P N="34">34. It often happens, that if a parcel is sent in from the country, by a waggon, and ordered to be left till called for, and you send for it, that they will tell you no such thing is brought, and then the porter of the inn will bring it, in order to get a shilling or two: in this case give him nothing, but before you give him to un∣derstand so, take possession of it, otherwise he will take it back again: should this fellow, by way of re∣venge, if any game is sent you, and not ordered to be delivered, not bring it, and it spoils, and the master of the waggon does not discharge him, summon the mas∣ter to the Court of Conscience, for the value of the thing spoilt, and you will be never served so again.
<PB N="152" REF="172"/>
Porters of inns are in general very exorbitant in their demands, and very insolent. If they ask too much for bringing a thing, never pay it, but tell them they may take it back again, and you will send for it.</P>
<P N="35">35. Persons would do well to be careful of their hats in public companies; for want of such care, many a person has brought home an old hat for a new one. There are well-looking men who will take an oppor∣tunity to exchange with you. I knew a gentleman who always preserved his hat, by pasting a paper <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the inside the crown, on which he wrote his name, and the words <HI>Stolen from</HI> over it. Canes and great coats are at times in similar danger.</P>
<P>See TAYLORS, page 41, and WALKING LONDON STREETS, page 115 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If the reader is desirous of a farther insight into the arts, deceptions and frauds, of the different professions, he cannot read a more useful work for this purpose, than a novel in three volumes, lately published, under the patronage of the Literary Society, called <HI>Modern Times,</HI> or the Adventures of <HI>Gabriel Outcast,</HI> written in imitation of Gil Blas, which, while it im∣proves him, and makes him acquainted with the vil∣lainy of the world, will exceedingly entertain him, it being penned with great humour, and by one who has apparently a thorough knowledge of life.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There is a Society of Tradesmen, &amp;c. instituted in 1767, for the protection of their property against the inroads of felons, forgers, cheats, &amp;c. and to save the charges of prosecutions, rewards and advertisements, which are paid out of the public stock, raised annually at five shillings each member; which subscription, tho' small, has not only been found sufficient for the pur∣poses intended, but has enabled the Society to vest a sum in the funds, besides leaving a considerable balance in the treasurer's hands.</P>
<P>The intent of this Society, is to prevent, as far as possible, the losses which tradesmen and others frequent∣ly suffer from the depredations of those miscreants, who get their infamous livelihoods by robbing, plundering, and defrauding the honest and industrious part of man∣kind;
<PB N="153" REF="173"/>
and to pursue the most vigorous and effectual methods to bring such offenders to justice; as they fre∣quently escape the punishment their crimes deserve, through the inability, timidity, avarice, or indolence of those they injure, which encourages them to con∣tinue their mal-practices; although such persons ought in duty to themselves and the public in general, to use their utmost endeavours to put a stop to the career of such villains, as otherwise they are, in some measure, by their omission, the cause of the next robbery or fraud they commit.</P>
<P>The secretary, who is a Mr. J. Leigh, of Shepherd's-court, Upper Brook-street, Grosvenor-square, is im∣powered to receive subscriptions.</P>
<P>Where there are two or more partners in trade, if five shillings only be subscribed, they are intitled to the benefit of this Society, when goods, the joint property of the partners, are stolen or obtained from them by fraud; but not in cases of robbery on the highway, or other robberies of their separate private property, un∣less each partner subscribes five shillings.</P>
<P>When any of the Society is robbed or defrauded, he is immediately to apply to one of the committee whose names are given in a printed list, and who will take such steps to pursue, advertise, or otherwise, as shall be thought proper on the occasion.</P>

<P N="2">2. There is another in Castle-street, Leicester-fields, for the parishes of St. Paul's Covent-garden, St. Mary Le Strand, St. Clement's, St. Martin's, St. Margaret's, St. John's Westminster, and the Duchy of Lancaster. Day of hearing, Thursday, in the afternoon.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="174"/>The above offices are open every day, from nine to one, to issue summonses. See No. 13, below.</P>
<P N="3">3. One in Fullwood's-rents, Holborn, for the hun∣dred of Ossulton, in the county of Middlesex, within ten miles of London, St. Giles's in the Fields, St. An∣drew's Holborn, Marybone, Pancras, St. John's Clerk∣enwell, and all those out of the city, which the courts of Vine-street and Castle-street do not comprehend. The office open from nine to three, to issue summon∣ses. See No. 14, below.</P>
<P N="4">4. One at Guildhall, for the city of London and its liberties. Days of hearing are Wednesdays and Satur∣days, at eleven in the morning.</P>
<P N="5">5. One at St. Margaret's-hill, in the Borough, for Southwark. See No. 10, below.</P>
<P N="6">6. One in Wellclose-square, for the Tower-hamlet, the parish of White-chapel, and places lying that way. The proceedings and costs much the same as at other courts.</P>
<P N="7">7. No persons shall act as a commissioner of the Courts of Conscience in London, Westminster, South∣wark, or the county of Middlesex, unless they are householders within the district, city or liberty they act for; and they shall also be possessed of a real estate of 20 l. a year, or a personal one of the value of 500l on pain of forfeiting 20 l. Action to be brought with∣in six months. 25 Geo. 3. c. 45.</P>
<P N="8">8. Persons committed for debt, by these courts, shal not be imprisoned longer than twenty days, for a deb not exceeding 20 s. nor more than forty days for a deb not exceeding 40 s. and, at the expiration of the time shall be discharged without fee or reward. Ibid.</P>
<P N="9">9. In the city of London, the expence of taking out a summons is 8 d. and the hearing, which must take place the next day of sitting, is attended only with the expence of 4 d.</P>
<P N="10">10. At St. Margaret's-hill, the days of hearing are Tuesdays and Fridays, in the afternoon, and the expence 4 d. The summons, if a common one, is 6 d. if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> special one, 10 d. The difference between a com¦mon and a special summons is this: the party need no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> attend the first day of hearing, after the service o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="155" REF="175"/>
a common summons, but he must of a special one. An execution is 2 s. and 8 d. is paid on receiving the debt.</P>
<P N="11">11. When the party has been served with an order, if he does not attend, the court adjudges the debt due to the plaintiff, and an execution is taken out, which seizes either the goods or the person of the debtor, and unless the money is then paid, and the costs, he is car∣ried to prison.</P>
<P N="12">12. The summonses for the Borough district are ta∣ken out at No. 2, Maze-pond, behind Guy's hospital.</P>
<P N="13">13. At the courts in Vine-street, and Castle-street, the price of a summons is 8 d. of an order 2 s. 2 d. of a hearing, after the delivery of a summons, 2 s. 2 d. of a hearing after the serving of an order, 1 s. 3 d. the cost of an execution is 2 s. 6 d. and the plaintiff's re∣ceiving his money 8 d. All the costs, except the last 8 d. the defendant is obliged to re-pay.</P>
<P N="14">14. The day of hearing at the court at Fullwood's Rents is Thursday; the Judge of this court is the County Clerk, who acts by deputy. The cost of a summons is 1 s. 4 d. of an order 2 s. of a hearing 2 s. of an execution 3 s. 4 d. These the defendants pay in the end, and the plaintiff can receive his money with∣out a fee.</P>
<P N="15">15. The determinations of the Courts of Conscience are final, but they generally indulge the debtor with time to pay the money, if he requests it. They will suffer him to pay it at a shilling or six-pence a week; this money must be regularly paid into the court, or an attachment against the party issues; and when the time elapses in which the whole debt is paid, the plaintiff applies to the court for his money, and receives it on paying a few pence.</P>
<P N="16">16. The plaintiffs and defendants in these courts are in general people so very low, that a gentleman would sooner lose 40 s. than attend them. If he is a defend∣ant, it is best to get some person to attend for him; if plaintiff, and can prove his demand, he may even then get some person to apply for him; but if he cannot prove his debt otherwise than by his own oath, he should attend himself, for if he has no other proof, the plaintiff's oath is always sufficient. Of course, it is
<PB N="156" REF="176"/>
better in these courts to be plaintiff than defendant, for if the plaintiff swears to his debt, no oath of the defen∣dant will avail him.</P>
<P N="17">17. In order to recover in these courts, the debt must be under 40 s. (at least the claim must), and both parties must reside in London. The summons must be taken out in that court in whose district the defendant lives.</P>
<P N="18">18. No oath is required on taking out the summons, nor is it necessary to spell the defendant's name right, or know his christian name; all that is required is to know where he is to be found, that the summons may be left at his place of residence; if the party will not attend by a summons, it is necessary to get the christian name of the defendant, in order to obtain an order, and if he is a housekeeper this is readily got at, by applying to the vestry-clerk of the parish where he lives, and examining the poors-rate book.</P>

<HEAD>THE MARSHALSEA COURT.</HEAD>
<P>WITHIN twelve miles of London, the power of the Marshalsea court in the Borough extends. Here by applying to any of the marshalsea-court at∣tornies, who live in Clifford's-inn Fleet-street, you may recover any sum above 40 s. and not exceeding 4 l. very speedily. A writ taken out in this court costs 7s. 6d. with which the defendant is served, and as the return day is every Friday, the cause cannot be put off. It will come to a hearing in the course of a week or two, and the hearing in this court seldom exceeds a few pounds. If your debt is 40 l. you may prosecute in this court, by suing for four pounds and upwards, and the person sued must pay your whole demand.— The costs in this court are paid always in advance, as the process goes on.</P>

<HEAD>THE VERGE OF THE COURT</HEAD>
<P>IS that ground about White-hall and St. James's, which belongs to the crown, and which is privi∣leged from arrests. This privileged place includes Charing-cross, on the north side of the way, from the' corner of St. Martin's-lane to Hedge-lane, and both the King's meuses. On the south side, from the street leading into Spring-gardens, to the public house beyond the Treasury, and all Spring-gardens; on the opposite side of the way, from Northumberland-house to the end of Privy-garden in Parliament-street, taking in all Scot∣land-yard, Whitehall, and Privy-garden. It further includes all the parks, the stable-yard St. James's, Cleveland-court, and all Hyde-park, except the mere crossing from the Green-park to Hyde-park. Most houses in the Verge let lodgings, and I knew an artful fellow once that eluded all his creditors, by residing there; if he wanted to go out of it, he took water at Whitehall-stairs, which place is privileged, and as no writ can be served on the water, without a water-bailiff's warrant, which cannot be immediately procu∣red, he would land safely in the city, or on the Surry side: for a Middlesex writ loses its force in the city, and in Surry, unless backed by a city or Surry magis∣trate, which requires time and preparation to get done; so that, if he landed in Surry, he might take his horse and ride to the land's-end, or he would occasionally walk through the parks, and order his horse to wait for him on the opposite side. By this means, he con∣stantly eluded the sheriff's officers, who could not be in every place, or eternally watching him.</P>
<P N="1">1. To prevent this, in some measure, the Board of Green Cloth, who has the controul of the verge, will, on application to them, at St. James's-palace, summon the debtor to meet the plaintiff, before them; and the gentlemen there presiding will examine into the nature of the complaint, enquire of the person then summoned what prospect he has of paying the debt; and if his proposals of discharging it by instalments,
<PB N="158" REF="178"/>
or in a limited period, be approved, they will suffer him to continue in the Verge, but if they find him dis∣posed to act fraudulently, they will tell him that the Verge shall not shelter him; and if he does not imme∣diately quit it, they will order him to be arrested by their own officer; but, let the case be as it will, they always give him notice to quit the place, and give him a reasonable time to do it in; but if he can make in∣terest with any of the gentlemen of the Board, he meets with favour there, as a man does in all situations of life.</P>
<P N="2">2. A sheriff's-officer arresting a man in the Verge, will be punished by an application to the Board of Green Cloth, and the person arrested will be dischar∣ged. The Board, or those who discharge the office of that Board, sit two or three times a week. Mr. Bray, attorney, Great Russel-street, Bloomsbury, is clerk of the Verge.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Tower is also a privileged place.</P>

<HEAD>HOTELS.</HEAD>
<P>THESE are taverns or inns, under a new name, so called from the hotels in Paris, where you may be rather better accommodated than at the inns in and about London, but at a much greater expence. The inns, and many coffee-houses (for all the coffee-houses are now lodging-houses and taverns) will let you a lodging at one shilling or eighteen-pence a night, where∣as these hotels charge 2 s. 6 d. or 5 s. a night, accord∣ing to the goodness of the apartment; and 5 s. a day for the use of a parlour or dining-room. Two shillings a day for fire, 1 s. a-head for breakfast, and for your dinner according to what you order, as dear as at the most expensive tavern. Here indeed a gentleman may take his family for a few days, till he can procure a lodging, which he cannot do at a coffee-house, nor so well at an inn, for want of proper accommodations. And the servants of all these houses are very extrava∣gant
<PB N="159" REF="179"/>
in their expectations, which you must accordingly gratify, if you wish to be well attended.—Hair-dressers at these hotels charge 1 s. each time of dressing, out of which the master of the hotel has a profit; whereas, at inns and coffee-houses they will dress for 6 d.</P>
<P>Foreigners and strangers should be aware how they employ taylors, or other tradesmen, recommended by masters of hotels, for they have a feeling in every thing. They expect the persons they recommend to give them poundage, that is, so much in every pound they take; of course the tradesman charges his custo∣mer accordingly.</P>

<P>By this estimate, the expences are less than keeping them in your own stable. To be sure, you have none of the coachman's service but that of driving, but then, on the other hand, you are not liable to lose the use of your carriage by accidents attending the horses. In∣deed, to keep a chariot and pair of horses properly, three horses should be kept for the purpose; and this advantage you have by hiring a job. If you will give the coachman his board, you may have all his time.</P>
<P>In the foregoing, and the following estimates, I have not pointed out, what a father of a family ought to lay by annually, as a provision for his wife and children. When he knows what his expences will be, his income will naturally tell him what he can save. Suffice it to say, that 75l. a year, put out to interest at five per
<PB N="173" REF="193"/>
cent. will, in twenty years, produce 2500l. of course, double the sum will produce 5000l. I have, in the course of this work, given the reader the terms of the different assurance-offices for life, where provision may be made for a family, or a future day, on easier terms.</P>
<P>The principal hay-markets in London are, Smith-field, White-chapel, and the Hay-market, Charing-cross. Market-days are, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.</P>
<P>The average-price of hay, in London, is 3 l. 5 s. a load: and that of straw 1 l. 5 s. Good hay is some∣times bought for 2 l. 5 s. and sometimes it reaches 5 l. Straw will sometimes be so low as 18 s. at other times 2 l. 2 s.</P>
<P>A load of hay is thirty-six trusses, each truss to weigh 56 lb. under a penalty; a load of straw thirty-six trus∣ses, each truss to weigh 36 lb.</P>
<P N="8">8. The following estimate is given more as a matter of curiosity than any thing else, to shew how much such a family, as in No. 1. may save upon a different plan, and what the expences of housekeeping amount to.</P>

<P>It is impossible to give estimates to suit every family, but it will be easy for any one to regulate his expences by these estimates, adding or deducting for a child or a servant, more or less, or for the difference of house-rent, certain indulgences, or the variation in the price of provisions. If every mistress keeps a weekly book, in the manner she will find pointed out to her in the next page, and has an eye upon her servants, should she exceed her expences one week, she may retrench them in another.</P>
<P>I must repeat here, that 15 or 20 per cent. may be saved in many articles, by buying them at the first hand, and paying ready money, where it conveniently can be done, besides preventing things being charged a family never had. However, by no means should a bill be run up, with either butcher, baker, chandler, green-grocer, or milkman.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="197"/>Such as wish to see estimates for families living in the country, may find them in a work published some years since, and which has gone through five editions, called, <HI>The Way to be rich and respectable;</HI> price 2 s.— Wherein is laid down a plan, whereby a gentleman, his wife, four children, and five servants, living in the country, with a few acres of land, may with frugality, save 2500 l. in twenty years, keep two of his children at a boarding-school, drink wine every day at his table, keep a carriage and four horses, and make an appear∣ance equal to a man in London that spends 1000 l. a year, for half the money.</P>
