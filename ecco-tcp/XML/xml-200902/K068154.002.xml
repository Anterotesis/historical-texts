<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I CANNOT resist the inclination this opportunity gives me of noticing how sincerely I rejoice that the tongue of malignity, which has so opened against me on the subject of these songs, is likely to be com∣pletely silenced.</P>
<P>Let it however be understood that, for any pri∣vate uneasiness the saucy slander ever gave me, for any fear I entertained lest it should depreciate me in the opinion of the judicious and the worthy, for any personal enmity I feel towards the miserable fools, who are punished enough by the gnawings of their own rancour:—for any of these, or similar considera∣tions, I should have suffered the noisome snuff to linger, till it became choaked in its own fetid dregs: but it has annoyed the public, and therefore it is my duty to put on the extinguisher.</P>
<P><PB REF="6"/>
The history of this business is very simple and self-evident. I started in life with some popularity, and therefore became an object of envy. Those who were galled at my success, endeavoured to crush me. They knew they could not do so honestly, and there∣fore they attempted it by villany. Public indigna∣tion, however, so astonished the reptiles, that they were glad to slink into their filthy lurking places for safety.</P>
<P>From that time onward, till within these three years—being connected with managers and music-shops, and working for mere hire—I lived pretty free from calumny. Throwing off every kind of yoke, however, and standing upon my own foundation—at which time I pledged myself that my productions should not, even in the minutest degree, receive as∣sistance from either manager, author, or composer—the vipers began again to rear their heads; and many—to the reproach of manhood, and the dishonour of human nature—are the wanton and wicked proofs that they are only scotehed, not killed.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="7"/>
This will be clearly evident if we notice that the medium through which they have attempted to emit their poison is a revival of the same slander which was originally levelled against my reputation, and which only shews that they have more wickedness than cun∣ning. They fancy that, could they induce a general belief that I imposed upon the world the productions of some other person, as my own, I should be held as a man void of faith or honour; but what proper indignation must fill every heart if it could be brought home to conviction that the principles of this person, of whom I am supposed to be merely the agent, are detested, and his memory execrated!</P>
<P>Could this be maintained, it would cut two ways. It would hold me up, both professionally and morally, as an impostor, and stimulate the public not only to damn my works, but my character. Poor, shallow-sighted idiots! They indeed know nothing of the na∣ture of public generosity. They have never ex∣perienced that it constantly follows laudable industry; that it ever encourages those endeavours which aim at conveying reasonable pleasure and useful instruc∣sion;
<PB N="viii" REF="8"/>
and that whom it protects, it raises far above the reach of malice or detraction. They only know, fallen as they are, that it is a bliss they dare not hope to enjoy, because they are unworthy to possess it.</P>
<P>Having spoken of managers and music-shops, it may not be improper to notice, that in separating myself from public connections, I am not actuated by any thing captious or capricious. I have no wish to cavil at men who have made bargains with me to their advantage. I cannot blame them for taking care of their interest, nor do I believe they blame me for taking care of mine: but, on the contrary—particu∣larly those with whom I have been most connected—wish well to my pursuits, and would lend my exertions every advantage in their power. Nor is there any thing wonderful in this; for it is a poor compliment to human integrity to suppose that it is not very na∣tural in us to assist those from whom we have received assistance.</P>
<P>Putting out of the question the rascality of my slanderers, I shall next examine whether there is any∣thing
<PB N="ix" REF="9"/>
like probability in their slander; premising, that I should not have condescended so far but for the only circumstance in all this business that gives me any thing like pain; and it is, that many men of strict honour, and cordial good wishes towards me, have, even in my presence, apparently given into something like a belief of what has been urged against me.</P>
<P>Such a leaven is there in the composition of man, and so captivating is a novel opinion, that I am afraid, should there be any malignity in it, there are very few who may not, under particular circumstances, suffer a momentary suspension of their integrity, to indulge an absurd curiosity. I declare I have had such questions asked me, by even kind and worthy friends, that had I not known an anxious solicitude had for an instant obscured probability, and outran re∣flection, I must, for the sake of my honour, have spit in their faces.</P>
<P>Nor is this language too strong. In what way can the best friend make me amends for having in∣dulgel, even for a single moment, a belief that I am
<PB N="x" REF="10"/>
the wretch these execrable villains would fain describe me? But my only revenge on those who have been thus betrayed from their duty as men, and tricked out of their charity as christians, shall be to shew upon how unsubstantial a foundation they have grounded their belief.</P>
<P>To go into this examination then. What is there in all we know of Mr. BICKERSTAFF to give the faintest colour to probability that he has written my songs, and that I always have been, and now am, his intimate friend? Is it because whatever he has written and whatever I have written are of a totally different complexion? Does he write my sea songs, because those in his <HI>Thomas and Sally</HI> are, taken technically, the absurdest nonsense that ever disgraced paper? Does the spirit of my poetry bear the cha∣racteristic of his, because his was study and mine is in∣tuition? Because he was timid, and I am bold? Be∣cause what I write is temporary, and for the mo∣ment, when he was the tardiest and most tedious of all writers? Did he, or could he, write any thing but songs? Do I write any thing but ballads? Have
<PB N="xi" REF="11"/>
I not uniformly rejected all assistance?—nay the as∣sistance of much better poets than he—and did he not court assistance from any body who would lend it him? Were not the suggestions of GOLDSMITH, KELLY, GARRICK, nay even SHUTER, and many others, caught at by him with avidity?</P>
<P>But did not these plain and self-evident facts laugh the assertion to scorn, is it likely that a man, as he was, of the most offensive and insufferable vanity, who never allowed the smallest spark of merit to his friends—no, not even in the moment they were lend∣ing advantage to his productions—is it probable that such a man, notwithstanding the merited obloquy a discerning and virtuous public has properly heaped on his head, would not manifest in some way his title to a share in my popularity? Or, to take it the other way, what strange inconsistency, or what singular atrocity, has so marked my public career as to make me appear on one side such a fool, and on the other such a knave, as to risk being first discovered, and afterwards betrayed, by the man of all others the most capable of such conduct?</P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="12"/>
Again, what are the fascinating qualities in Mr. BICKERSTAFF that should induce me to imitate him as a man, and risk public benevolence for private in∣famy? Am I impelled by gratitude in return for his driving hard bargains with me; of his taking ad∣vantage of my inexperience, and rewarding me with a trifle, for labours by which he got large sums of money; for being continually unfaithful to his en∣gagements, or for running away in my debt? Am I enamoured of that insincerity for which he was re∣markable and notorious?—for that profligacy and immorality which characterised his opinions?—for that supercilious hauteur through which he would affront his friends?—or the pusillanimity which terri∣fied him into begging their pardon! The climax of this paragraph I will not stain my paper with. My heart does not tell me that any single dispassionate man upon earth will accuse me of an inclination to emulate the above qualities, and I flatter myself I shall not easily be suspected of pre-eminence in iniquity. And now let my calumniaters, with their usual truth and consistency, assert that this is a panegyric on Mr. BICKERSTAFF, and that he wrote it!</P>
<P><PB N="xiii" REF="13"/>
But this dare not now be ventured. The public indignation is once more roused, and woe to those who have provoked it! My cause is become the cause of every honest man in the kingdom. Every man's honour, every man's character, and every man's interest is involved in it. It is not now a ques∣tion whether, in common with hundreds of high distinction, brilliant talents, and unspotted honour, I shall, with indifference and contempt, see the lie of the day levelled at me, but it is a question whether, as an innocent man, I shall be protected by society, or, as a perjurer, driven from it.</P>
<P>This slander became at length so rank, so shame∣less, and was so universally diffused, that, in justice to myself as a man and a citizen, I have appealed to the laws of my country. Disdaining to proceed other∣wise than by indictment, I have been granted a rule to shew cause why an information should not be filed against the person who has thought proper to libel me; and, to obtain that rule, I have sworn <Q REND="inline">"that I have not, at any time, seen Mr. BICKERSTAFF, nor had any
<PB N="xiv" REF="14"/>
correspondence with him, since he absconded, and that I know not whether he be alive or dead."</Q></P>
<P>The matter is therefore now brought to a most serious and solemn point. My reputation is in the hands of the public, and every man of virtue and ho∣nour must pronounce for me, that no one, but an un∣principled villain, will hereafter dare to mention my name coupled with any insinuation of the nature I complain of, unless he shall not only accuse me, but convict me, of perjury.</P>
<P>I have written this preface at the solicitation and for the satisfaction of those many friends whose warm and kind anxiety shall be remembered by me while my heart feels that gratitude which is its sweetest and dearest sensation. In the course of it I have carefully studied not to anticipate nor prejudge any thing before the court. I have only given an unqualified contradiction of what has been alledged against me, and maintained my position by such probable circumstances as sug∣gested themselves. This it was particularly my duty
<PB N="xv" REF="15"/>
to do, on bringing out these songs; but I have not presumed to teach, or dictate. The subject is open to liberal discussion. It is here at issue, as well as at the King's-bench; and I am neither ashamed nor afraid of what may be the decision in either place.</P>

<L>I SING of that life of delight beyond measure,</L>
<L>That tars calmly lead on the boisterous main,</L>
<L>Where toil is enjoyment, where trouble's all pleasure,</L>
<L>And where men lose their lives, a sure fortune to gain:</L>

<L>Where you fear no diseases but sickness and scurvy,</L>
<L>Where the water stinks sweetly, by way of a zest,</L>

<L>And where, though you sleep soundly, you're never at rest!</L>

<L>Of sailors, their grog, and their sweethearts, and wives,</L>
