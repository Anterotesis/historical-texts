<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE first hint of this Comedy was suggested by the <HI>Cocu Imaginaire</HI> of <HI>Moliere,</HI> who took the idea of his piece from an Italian writer. Though jealousy, in all its appearances, has been frequently exhi∣bited on the English stage, yet it was ima∣gined that a plan, which should delineate all the varieties of that passion, whether sub∣sisting between lovers or in the matrimonial life, and blend them together in one piece, would not be unacceptable to the public. If therefore there is atonement made for the want of originality of character by the de∣cency of the dialogue, the novelty of the fable, and the complication of the incidents, the author has compassed all that he pro∣posed to himself in the ensuing scenes; which, with pleasure he finds, were the occasion of producing the too long concealed powers of Miss <HI>Haughton,</HI> and of shewing, in a distin∣guished light, the exquisite acting of Mr. <HI>Obrien.</HI></P>

<STAGE>SCENE <HI>the Park.</HI></STAGE>
<STAGE><HI>Enter Sir</HI> JOHN RESTLESS <HI>and</HI> ROBERT, <HI>from a House in the Side Scene.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>IR John Restless!—Sir John Rest∣less! thou hast play'd the fool with a vengeance.—What devil whis∣pered thee to marry such a woman?—Robert,—you have been a faithful servant in my family, Robert, and I value you.—Did your lady go out at this door here into the park, or did she go out at the street door?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROB.</SPEAKER>
<P>This door, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Robert, I will never live in a house again that has two doors to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will give warning to my landlord instantly.—The eyes of Argus are not sufficient to watch the motions of a wife, where there is a street door, and a back door, to favour her escapes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word, Sir, I wish—you will pardon my boldness, Sir,—I wish you would shake off this uneasiness that preys upon your spirits—It grieves me to the heart,—it does, in∣deed, Sir, to see you in this way—Banish your suspicions, Sir—you have conceived some strange aversion, I am afraid, to my lady, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Robert; no aversion—in spite of me I doat upon her still—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then why will you not think generously, Sir, of the person you love?—my lady, I dare be sworn—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is false to me.—That embitters my whole life—I love her, and she repays me with ingratitude, with perfidy,—with falsehood,—with—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROB.</SPEAKER>
<P>I dare be sworn, Sir, she is a woman of honour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Robert, I have considered you as a friend in my house—Don't you betray me too—Don't justify her—don't—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Sir, if you will but give me leave—you have been an indulgent master to me, and I am only concerned for your welfare—You mar∣ried my lady for love, and I have heard you so warm in her praise—why will you go back from those sentiments?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I married her for love—Oh! love! love!—What mischief dost thou not occa∣sion in this world?—Yes, Robert; I married her for love.—When first I saw her I was not so much struck with her beauty, as with that air of an in∣genuous mind that appeared in her countenance;—her features did not so much charm me with their symmetry, as that expression of sweetness, that smile that indicated affability, modesty, and compliance.—But, honest Robert, I was de∣ceived—I was not a month married, when I saw her practising those very smiles at her glass—I saw thro' the artifice; plainly saw there was no∣thing natural in her manner, but all forced, all studied, put on with her head-dress—I was alarm∣ed; I resolved to watch her from that moment, and I have seen such things—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word, Sir, I believe you wrong her, and wrong yourself—you build on groundless surmizes;—you make yourself unhap∣py, and my lady too; and by being constantly uneasy, and never shewing her the least love,—you'll forgive me, Sir,—you sill her mind with strange suspicions, and so—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Suspicions, Robert!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir; strange suspicions!—My lady finds herself treated with no degree of tender∣ness; she infers that, your inclinations are fixed elsewhere, and so she is become—you will par∣don my blunt honesty—she is become downright jealous,—as jealous as yourself, Sir.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! Robert, you are little read in the arts of women; you little know the intrica∣cies of their conduct; the mazes thro' which they walk, shifting, turning, winding, running into devious paths, but tending all thro' a laby∣rinth
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>to the temple of Venus;—you cannot see, Robert, that all her pretences to suspect me of infidelity are merely a counter-plot to cover her own loose designs;—'tis but a gauze-covering, tho'—it is seen thro' and only serves to shew her guilt the more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word, Sir John, I cannot see—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Robert; I know you can't—her suspicions of me all make against her; they are but female stratagems, and yet it is but too true that she still is near my heart.—Oh! Robert, Robert, when I have watched her at a play, or elsewhere,—when I have counted her oglings, and her whisperings, her stolen glances, and her artful leer, with the cunning of her sex, she has pretended to be as watchful of me—Dissembling, false, deceitful woman!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROB.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, I dare assure you—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>No more; I am not to be deceived; I know her thoroughly, and now,—now—has not she escaped out of my house, even now?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROB.</SPEAKER>
<P>But with no bad design.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am the best judge of that—which way did she go?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Across the Park, Sir—that way, Sir—towards the Horse-guards—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Towards the Horse-guards!—there,—there,—there—the thing is evident;—you may go in, Robert.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir, I—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go in, I say; go in—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROB.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is no persuading him to his own good</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE>
<SP>
<STAGE>Sir JOHN <HI>alone.</HI></STAGE>
<P>Gone towards the Horse-guards!—my head aches,—my forehead burns—I am cutting my
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>horns—Gone towards the Horse-Guards!—I'll pursue her thither; if I find her, her usual arti∣fice will fail her—the time, the place, will all in∣form against her.—Sir John! Sir John! you were a madman to marry such a woman.—</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> BEVERLEY <HI>and</HI> BELLMONT, <HI>at opposite Sides.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! my dear Bellmont—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Beverley!—I rejoice to see you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well! I suppose the same cause has brought us both into the Park; both come to sigh amorous vows in the friendly gloom of yon∣der walk;—Belinda keeps a perpetual war of love and grief, and hope and fear in my heart—and let me see— <STAGE>(<HI>lays his hand on Bellmont's breast</HI>)</STAGE> how fares all here? I fancy my sister is a little busy here—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Busy!—she makes a perfect riot there—not one wink the whole night—Oh! Clarissa, Clarissa! her form so animated! her eyes so—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee! truce; I have not leisure to at∣tend to her praise—a sister's praise too!—Faith, the greatest merit I ever could see in Clarissa is, that she loves you freely and sincerely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>And to be even with you, Sir,—your Belinda, upon my soul, notwithstanding all your lavish praises, her highest perfection, in my mind, is her sensibility to the merit of my friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! Bellmont, don't talk prophanely—Such a girl!
<Q><L>Scarce can I to heav'n excuse</L>
<L>The devotion which I use</L>
<L>Unto that adored dame;</L></Q>
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>But, my dear Bellmont, tell me honestly now, do you think she has ever betrayed the least regard for me?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can you, Beverley, you that have such convincing proofs, how can you ask such a question—that uneasiness of yours, that inqui∣etude of mind—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee now don't fix that character upon me—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is your character, my dear Beverley: and instead of enjoying the object before you, you are ever looking back to something past, or conjecturing about something to come, and are your own self-tormentor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, no; don't say so; I hate the very notion of such a temper: the thing is, when a man loves tenderly as I do, sollicitude and anxiety are natural; and when Belinda's father opposes my warmest wishes—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why yes, the good Mr. Blandford is willing to give her in marriage to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>The senseless old dotard!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank you for the compliment!—and my father, the wise Sir William Bellmont—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is a tyrannical, positive, headstrong—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>There again I thank you—But in short, the old couple, Belinda's father and mine, have both agreed upon the match, and they insist upon compliance from their children; so that, accord∣ing to them, I am to be married off-hand to your mistress, and you and your sister, poor Cla∣rissa, are to be left to shift for yourselves.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Racks and torment!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Racks and torment!—Seas of milk and ships of amber, man!—we are sailing to our
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>wished for harbour, in spite of their machina∣tions.—I have settled the whole affair with Cla∣rissa.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have, and to-morrow morning makes me possessor of her charms.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear boy, give us your hand;—and then, thou dear rogue, and then Belinda's mine— <STAGE>(<HI>sings</HI>) <HI>Loll-toll-loll</HI>—</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well may you be in raptures, Sir; for here, here, here they both come—</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> BELINDA, and CLARISSA.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEV.</SPEAKER>
<L>Grace was in all her steps; heav'n in her eye;</L>
<L>In every gesture, dignity and love.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>A poetical reception truly!—But can't your passion inspire you to a composition of your own Mr. Beverley?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>It inspires me with sentiments, Madam, which I can't find words to express.—Sucklin, Waller, Landsdown, and all our dealers in love∣verses, give but a faint image of a heart touched like mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor Gentleman! what a terrible tak∣ing you are in! But if the sonneteers cannot give an image of you, Sir, have you had recourse to a painter, as you promised me—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have Belinda, and here,—here is the humble portrait of your adorer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELIN.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(<HI>Takes the picture.</HI>)</STAGE>
<P>Well! there is a likeness—but after all, there is a better painter than this gentleman, whoever he be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>A better!—now she is discontented <STAGE>(<HI>aside</HI>)</STAGE> where, Madam, can a better be found?—if mo∣ney can purchase him—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER>BELIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! Sir, when he draws for money he never succeeds—But when pure inclination prompts him, then his colouring is warm in∣deed—He gives a portrait that endears the ori∣ginal.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Such an artist is worth the Indies.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You need not go so far to seek him—he has done your business already—The limner I mean is a certain little blind god, called Love, and he has stamped such an impression of you here—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, your most obedient,—and I can tell you, that the very same gentleman has been at work for you too.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELL.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(<HI>who had been talking apart with Cla∣rissa.</HI>)</STAGE> Oh! he has had a world of business upon his hands, for we two have been agreeing what havock he has made with us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but we are but in a kind of fool's paradise here; all our schemes are but mere castle-building, which your father, Mr. Bell∣mont,—and my dear Belinda,—yours too are most obstinately determined to destroy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why as you say, they are determined that I shall have the honour of Belinda's hand in the country-dance of matrimony.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without considering that I may like another partner better—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>And without considering that I, forlorn as I am, and my sister, there—who is as well inclined to a matrimonial game of romps as any girl in Christendom, must both of us sit down, and lead apes in hell, in spite of our strongest in∣clinations to mingle in the groupe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>But we have planned our own happi∣ness, and with a little resolution we shall be suc∣cessful
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>in the end I warrant ye.—Clarissa, my an∣gel, let us take a turn this way, and leave that love-sick pair to themselves—they are only fit company for each other, and we can find where∣withal to entertain ourselves.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay! let us turn this way.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What are you going to leave us, Cla∣rissa?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only just sauntering into this side∣walk—we sha'nt lose one another.—</P>

<P>Oh! you are such a tender couple—you are not tired I see of saying pretty soft things to each other.—Well! well!—take your own way.—</P>

<P>Madam!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Madam!—ha! ha! why you look as
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>if you were frightened—are you afraid of being left alone with me?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! Belinda, you know that is the hap∣piness of my life;—but—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what, Sir?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am afraid I have done something to offend you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>To offend me!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Belinda; I should have been of the party last night; I own I should; it was a suffi∣cient inducement for me that you was to be there; it was my fault, and you I see are piqued at it.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I piqued!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see you are; and you was so last night too—I have heard it all, and in mere resentment you directed all your discourse to Mr. Bellmont.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I did, it was merely accidental.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, it was deliberately done;—forgive my rash folly in refusing the invitation—I meant no manner of harm—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who imagines you did, Sir?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg your pardon, Belinda, you take offence too lightly—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! what have you taken into your head now?—this uneasiness is of your own making—I have taken nothing ill, Sir—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>You could not but take it ill; but by all that's amiable about you, I meant not to in∣cur your displeasure—forgive that abrupt answer I sent—I should have made a handsomer apo∣logy.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Apology!—what occasion was there for any thing more?—you said you was pre-en∣gaged, did not you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>
<SPEAKER>BEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>I said so; I own it, and beg your par∣don—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Beg my pardon! for what? ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>I only meant—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! can you think I see any thing in your message to be offended at, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where you were concerned, I own I should have expressed myself with more delicacy, than those hasty words, I am engaged, and can't wait upon you to-night. I should have told you that my heart was with you, though necessity dragged me another way—but this omission you resent∣ed—I could learn, since, the spirits you were in the whole evening, though I enjoyed nothing in your absence—I could hear the sallies of your wit, the sprightliness of your conversation, and on whom your eyes were fixed the whole night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>They were fixed upon Mr. Bellmont, you think!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay! and fixed with delight upon him; seemed negociating the business of love before the whole company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word, Sir, whoever is your author, he has misinformed you; and let me tell you, you alarm me with these fancies, and you know I have often told you that you are of too refining a temper—you create for yourself ima∣ginary misunderstandings, and then are ever en∣tering into explanations—I assure you, Mr. Be∣verley, this watching for intelligence, from the spies and misrepresenters of conversation, betrays the symptoms of jealousy, and I would not be married to a jealous man for the world.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now she is seeking occasion to break off.— <STAGE>(<HI>aside.</HI>)</STAGE> Jealousy, Ma'am, can never get admission into my breast, I am of too generous
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>a temper; a certain delicacy I own I have; I value the opinion of my friends, and when there are circumstances of a doubtful as∣pect, I am glad to set things in their true light;—and surely, Belinda, if I do so with others, surely with you on whom my happiness depends to desire a favourable interpretation of my words and actions—</P>

<P>Ay! but that quickness, and that extreme sensibility is what I am afraid of.—I po∣sitively would not have a jealous husband for the world—</P>

<P>By heaven! no earthly circumstance shall ever make me think injuriously of you.—Jealousy!—ha! ha!—it is the most ridiculous passion—ha! ha!</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>BELIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may laugh, Sir; but I know your over-refining temper too well, and I abso∣lutely will have it in our marriage-articles, that I must not be plagued with your suspicions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>I subscribe, ma'am—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will have no enquiries where I am going to visit; no following me from place to place; and if we should chance to meet, and you should perceive a man of wit, or a pretty fel∣low,
<PB N="16" REF="19"/>speaking to me, I will not have you fidget∣ting about on your chair, knitting your brow, and looking at your watch—<Q>My dear, is it not time to go home?—my love, the coach is waiting:</Q>—and then, if you are prevailed upon to stay, I will not have you converse with a "yes, Sir," and a "no, Sir," for the rest of the evening, and then wrangle with me in the chariot all the way home, and not be commonly civil to me for the rest of the night—I posi∣tively will have none of this—.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Agreed, ma'am, agreed—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>And then you shan't tell me you are going out of town, and then sneak in privately to the play, or to Ranelagh, merely to be a spy upon me—and I positively will admit no curio∣sity about my letters—if you were to open a let∣ter of mine, I should never forgive you—I do verily believe, if you were to open my letters I should hate you—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>I subscribe to every thing you can ask—you shall have what female friends you please; loose your money to whom you please; dance with what beau you please; ride out with whom you please; go to what china shop you please; and, in short, do what you please, without my attempting to bribe your footman, or your maid to—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! lud! Oh! lud! that is in the very strain of jealousy—Heaven deliver me!—there is my father yonder, and Sir William Bell∣mont with him—Fly—this instant, fly, Mr. Be∣verley, down that walk—any where—</P>

<P>You promise then—</P>

<P>Why then we have only to ac∣quaint the young people with our intentions, and so conclude the affair—</P>

<P>That is all, Sir.</P>

<P>As to my girl, I don't mind her nonsense about Beverley—she must do as I will have her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>And my son too, he must follow my directions.—As to his telling me of his love for Clarissa, it is all a joke to me—Children must do as their parents will have them.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. BLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay! ay! so they must; and so they shall—hey! here is my daughter—So Be∣linda!—well, my girl, Sir William and I have agreed, and so you are to prepare for marriage, that's all—</P>

<P>You know you encouraged him your∣self, Sir—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>BLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well! I have changed my mind on that head—my friend, Sir William, here offers

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, madam, I will be obeyed—You don't like him, you say—but I like him—and that's sufficient for you—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so it is, Mr. Blandford;—if my son pretended to have a will of his own, I should let him know to the contrary—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>And can you, Sir William, against our inclination force us both?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold your tongue, Belinda; don't provoke me—What makes you from home?—go your ways back to Queen's-Square directly, and settle your mind; for I tell you once for all I will have my own way.—Come, Sir William, we will step to the lawyer's chambers.—Go home, Belinda, and be observant of my commands.—Come along, Sir William—what did you say?—you mutiny, do you?—don't provoke me—You know, Belinda, I am an odd sort of a man when provok'd—Look ye here—mind what I say; I won't reason with you about the matter; my power is absolute, and if you offer to rebel, you shall have no husband at all with my con∣sent—I'll cut you off with a shilling; I'll see you starve—beg an alms—live miserable—die wretched—in short, suffer any calamity without the least compassion from me—if I should find you an undutiful girl at last—so there's one word for all—</P>

<P>You repine for want of freedom, do you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady REST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Cruel laws of wedlock!—The tyrant-husband may triumph in his infidelity,

<P>To-morrow morning!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, to-morrow morning I release Mr. Bellmont from his fetters, and resign my person to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, that is what all we poor wo∣men, after all the victories of our charms, all the triumphs of our beauty, and all the murders of our eyes, must come to at last.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and in that we but imitate the men. Don't we read of them conquering whole kingdoms, and then submitting at last to be go∣verned by the vanquished.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, Clarissa; and upon my word I think you are a heroine equal in fame to any of them; nay superior, for your scheme, I take it, is not to unpeople the world—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee, Belinda, don't talk so wildly; for, to tell you the truth, now that I have settled the affair, I begin to be alarmed at what I have done.—</P>

<P>Actually now, positively, I am terrified to death.—</P>

<SPEAKER>BELIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha!—to be sure—our sex must play its tricks, and summon up all its fantastic train of doubts and fears—but courage, my dear, don't be frightened, for the same sex within that heart of yours will urge you on, and never let you be at rest, till you have procured yourself a tyrant for life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLA.</SPEAKER>
<P>A tyrant, Belinda! I think more ge∣nerously of Mr. Bellmont, than to imagine he will usurp to himself an ill use of his power—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>To deal candidly with you, I am of your opinion—but, tell me now, a'n't I a very good girl, to resign such a man to you?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, indeed, I must confess the obli∣gation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay! but to resign him for one, whose temper does not promise I shall live under so mild a government.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLA.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do you mean?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Why, Mr. Beverley's strange caprices, suspicions, and unaccountable whimsies, are enough to alarm one upon the brink of matri∣mony.</P>

<P>Well, I vow I can't help thinking, Be∣linda, that you are a little subject to vain sur∣mises and suspicions yourself.</P>

<P>Come now, you are an insincere girl; you know I am of a temper too generous, too open—</P>

<P>I grant all that, but by this constant re∣petition of the same doubts, I should not wonder to see you most heartily jealous of him—</P>

<P>Oh! madam, I can justify you—ha! ha! that is but a poor evasion, and confirms me the more in my opinion—and I humbly take my leave—</P>

<P>I the cause!—you wrong me—by hea∣ven you wrong me—my lady Restless was the cause—she told me such things—she planted daggers in my very heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLA.</SPEAKER>
<P>You planted daggers in her heart—and it was barbarous.—What, because a lady has not strength enough to bear up against a father, who is resolved to give her away to another, and because she faints out of excessive tenderness for you, and in that distress meets accidental relief from Sir John Restless at his own door—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>How!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLA.</SPEAKER>
<P>And because my lady Restless sees this out of her window, and has a perverse talent of misinterpreting appearances into realities, to her own disadvantage—you must therefore fill your head with ungenerous suspicions—Oh! for shame, for shame, how could you?—</P>

<P>Po! you talk as if you were wholly un∣letter'd in the tempers of women—my dear bro∣ther, you know, you men can do what you please with us, when you have got an interest in our hearts—go to her, I say, go to her, and make your peace—</P>

<P>Sir, you have injured me in my love and in my honour, Sir—no—not my love, for that is over—I despise her, scorn her, reject her—</P>

<P>Eloped! mind that Sir John,—the thing is clear.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady REST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heavens deliver me!—how can you say so?—Sir, <STAGE>(<HI>to Blandford</HI>)</STAGE> I am very sorry to say any thing disagreeable to a father of his daughter—but, when my happiness is destroyed, ceremony is unnecessary,—your daughter has made me miserable, Sir.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry for it, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Blandford, you are father to this lady, Sir—don't make yourself uneasy; for I will vouch for her innocence of my lady's charge against her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady REST.</SPEAKER>
<P>He will deny every thing, no doubt—but facts are too stubborn, and ocular demonstration I have had.</P>

<P>Ocular demonstration!</P>

<P>Yes, Sir; I have seen their fa∣miliarities.</P>

<P>Sir, I desire to hear no more—I am satisfied, and must desire not to marry my son into your family—Clarissa—you have my consent as soon as you please—my son is at your service—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, Sir William, since you pro∣voke me, Sir, you shan't have my daughter.
<PB N="101" REF="104"/>—Mr. Beverley, I no longer oppose your incli∣nations, she is yours—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you slight my son, Sir?—you use me very ill—and I would have you know—</P>

<SPEAKER>BLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall never refuse my daughter again, I promise you—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor shall you my son, Sir—Here, George, take your Clarissa—I give her away to you—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLA.</SPEAKER>
<P>The gentleman has declared himself for that lady, and—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, ma'am, that lady has no share in my affections, and, in compliance with my father's in∣junctions, thus let me seize your hand, and de∣vote to you all my future days.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's very well, Sir William,—Mr. Be∣verley, here is my daughter for you—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady REST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, now, if he will accept of her, I shall begin to think that I have been mis∣taken—and that all my suspicions of the lady are without foundation—But, I dare say, the gen∣tleman knows better—What do you say, Sir? will you marry the lady?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>If that proof will satisfy you, madam—</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>BELIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, hold, a moment—Explain the business that brought you hither, Sir; answer to Sir John's charge against you—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Sir, answer that—if she agrees to marry him, I shall be satisfied too—But, Sir, my lady's being in possession of your picture, your frequent visits to my house, Sir, and other circumstances—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, a word or two will clear that matter—I had given a picture to this lady in the Park—she, I find, dropped it when she fainted away—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="102" REF="105"/>
<SPEAKER>BLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you faint, Belinda?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did, Sir, immediately after you treated me in such severe terms—in the morn∣ing—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>And then it was I accidentally came to her relief, which my lady, according to cus∣tom, has conceived in the manner you see.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how came you by the picture, madam?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady REST.</SPEAKER>
<P>I found it in the very spot where I saw your daughter in the Park. The truth be∣gins to break in upon me—</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>This opens my eyes a little—</P>
</SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>BLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>And have you been ingenious enough, madam, to work up all these circumstances into a charge against Sir John—ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>'I is ever her way, Sir—I told you how ridiculous you would make yourself, my dear; ha! ha!—You see, what your suspicions are come to at last—ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you may see, Sir John, what your suspicions are come to—I never was within your doors before this day; nor should I perhaps have spoke to my lady, had it not been for the mis∣takes your mutual jealousies occasioned between Belinda and me—I cannot help laughing at the whole affair—ha! ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, you may laugh—but I have an∣other complaint against my Lady Restless—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady REST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir John, Sir John, I have an∣other charge against you—that jade whom you made an assignation with—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! madam, Robert knows that whole affair—I'll bring him hither directly, and

<SPEAKER>BELIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, and now it's over; you have but commanded me to gratify my incli∣nations, for we have both seen our error, and frankly confess we have been in the wrong too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, I think we have been all so; Mr. Blandford, we should not have opposed their inclinations, when we had it in our power to make two such happy matches instead of one—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true; and now I wish the young folks all happiness;—and, Sir John, I wish you and your lady happy too—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, it has been a day of mistakes, but of fortunate ones, I hope, and may tend to all our advantage—My lady here will be taught—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady REST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir John, I hope you will be taught—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never mention what is past—the wrangling of married people about any little misconduct is only like the lashing of a top; it serves to keep it up the longer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are very right, Sir; and as we have been all in the wrong this day, we will, for the future, endeavour to be "All in the Right."</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Here Lady Restless talks apart with Belinda.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>A good proposal, Sir John; we will make it our business, both you who are married, and we who are entering into that state, by mutual confidence, to insure mutual happiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="106" REF="109"/>
<SPEAKER>BELIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>A match, Mr. Beverley; I subscribe to it;—
<Q><L>The god of love thinks we prophane his fire,</L>
<L>When trifles light as air mistrust inspire.</L>
<L>But where esteem and gen'rous passions spring,</L>
<L>There reigns secure, and waves his purple wing;</L>
<L>Gives home-felt peace, prevents the nuptial strife,</L>
<L>Endears the bliss, and bids it last for life.</L></Q></P>
