<HEAD>TO THE HONOURABLE <HI>Robert Nugent,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> One of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have not taken up the Pen to trouble you with an Address in the usual Stile of Dedicators; to a warm and lively Imagination, such as Mr. NUGENT's, Novelty will appear an essential Grace in
<PB REF="4"/>Composition; and what Kind of Novelty can, at this Time of Day, be introduced in a Form of Writ∣ing, which has been indiscrimi∣nately hackneyed by the Witty, the Venal, and the Dull for several Centuries? I shall therefore have no Recourse to exhausted Topics, nor shall I endeavour to cull from the Stores of common Place a Se∣cond-hand Garland, which would not fail to be offensive to your De∣licacy, however, your Politeness might induce you to excuse the Aukwardness of the Attempt. I shall leave it, Sir, to the City of <HI>Bri∣stol,</HI> to speak aloud of your eminent Abilities, and to the Annals of Par∣liament, to display the brilliant
<PB REF="5"/>Share you have had in all public Debates, without adding the Ef∣forts of my feeble Voice to echo back your Fame in Dedicatory Panegyric; though I persuade my∣self, were I to trouble you with it, one Degree of Novelty, might be allowed me, I mean Sincerity; which I take to be a Quality totally unknown to the Offerers of In∣cense.</P>
<P>BUT it is not the able States∣man I am at present to address; it is the Patronage of the Man of Genius, Wit and Humour my Am∣bition has prompted me to solicit, and, I believe, every one will agree with me that I could not any where
<PB REF="6"/>chuse a Name more justly distin∣guished for those splendid Embel∣lishments, than that of Mr. NU∣GENT.</P>
<P>I AM not insensible, that, in doing this, I may fall under the Censure of the witty Doctor <HI>Young</HI> when he says,
<Q><L>As Pedlars with some Hero's Head make bold,</L>
<L>Illustrious Mark!—where Pins are to be sold.</L></Q></P>
<P>THE Truth is, I am afraid, the fugitive Pieces contained in these little Volumes will hardly be found worthy of your Attention; but if
<PB REF="7"/>they are admitted to lie in any Corner of your Study, I shall con∣gratulate with myself that they have found so honourable a Shelter, and I shall be ever proud of having seized this Opportunity of sub∣scribing myself,</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>IT is observed by Lord <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> that every Man, who publishes a Book, pro∣fesses Wisdom; but the Author of the following Essays begs Leave to make himself an Exception to this general Rule of the noble Writer. Having had some Reason to imagine that the Numbers of the GRAY's-INN JOURNAL, during its periodi∣cal Publication, were not unacceptable to the Public, he determined not to leave them in their scattered Condition, and has therefore been at some Pains to collect them together, in as neat a Manner as he could, and with as many Retrenchments, Additions and Corrections as his various Avocations would permit. He has only to add, that, with all due Resignation, he gives up Commas and Points, Errors of the Press, and all those Inaccuracies, which <HI>Horace</HI> tells us arise from Inadvertency, or the Imbecillity of human Nature, to
<PB REF="9"/>the small Critics, and anonymous Pam∣phleteers, of whom he has given his Opi∣nion in the Essay, No. 88. He hopes no reasonable Exception can be made by the Sensible and the Candid to his Sentiments in general, or the occasional Frolicks of an assumed Character. It should be remem∣bered, that Mr. <HI>Johnson</HI>'s Remark in the <HI>Rambler</HI> is founded upon Truth and Justice. "The seeming Vanity," says that excellent Author, <Q>with which I have sometimes spoken of myself, would perhaps require an Apology, were it not extenuated by the Example of those, who have pub∣lished Essays before me, and by the Pri∣vilege, which every nameless Author has been hitherto allowed. A Mask, says <HI>Ca∣stiglione,</HI> confers a right of acting and speaking with less Restraint, even when the Wearer happens to be known.</Q></P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T has been remarked by Writers, whom a Desire of adding to the Entertainment of the Public has incited to portion out their Endeavours into periodical Essays, that the first Address, in the introduc∣tory Explanation of their Plan, has occasioned more vehement Corrosions of their Nails, and more frequent Rubbings of the Forehead, than any other successive Composition; in like Manner as we find Men, who, upon their first Admission into a Company of Strangers, betray several aukward Move∣ments in their Deportment, arising from the different Ideas of Bashfulness and Diffidence, which agitate their Minds until the initial Ceremonies are adjusted. As I propose to hold a literary Intercourse with the Pub∣lic, and flatter myself with the Hopes of conversing with
<PB N="2" REF="13"/>many Hundreds of my Countrymen every <HI>Saturday,</HI> I cannot issue out my first Performance, without feeling an extraordinary Solicitude for the Event, and being disconcerted by those Alarms and Perturbations of Spi∣rit, which are apt to seize People of Sensibility in their Tempers, when irresistible Principles of Action have prevailed over their Modesty, and called them forth into a conspicuous Point of View. The first Impression has always great Influence upon Mens Judgments, and the Mind will often hastily form Associations of Ideas, which it cannot afterwards easily separate. On this Account I have been a not a little anxious about my first Appearance, and after much Contemplation and deep Study, I should have been entirely at a Loss how to set off, had not the Example of our parliamentary Candi∣dates pointed out a Mode of Eloquence, to which I think proper to adhere on the present Occasion, as the most persuasive Rhetoric I can suggest to myself.</P>

Having thus declared my Ambition for literary Fame, I do not expect that all those rival Wits, who for some Time past have been making their Court to the Pub∣lic, should instantly decline the Poll; on the contrary, I am apprehensive, that, as it generally happens at E∣lections, much Scurrility will be discharged upon the present Writer; and I am no way doubtful but they will proceed to the Extremity of disputing my Property in <HI>Parnassus,</HI> and obliging me to make out my Quali∣fication. Of this, however, I hope to give sufficient Proof in the Sequel; and whatever Animosities may arise, I am resolved to pursue my Course, without going out of the Way, like the Countryman in the Fable, to crush the Grashoppers that may make a Noise around me. I shall console myself in that Case with a Reflection that those Nuisances are ever found in the Sunshine.</P>
<Q>Sole sub ardenti resonant arbusta cicadis.
<BIBL><HI>VIRGIL.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P>In the Prosecution of this Design the Reader is not to expect any Scandal, any Detraction, or Ill-nature, <HI>Ranger</HI> being determined not to indulge himself in the <HI>mala mentis gaudia,</HI> as <HI>Virgil</HI> finely calls the Gratifica∣tions of a malevolent Spirit. As this Paper is com∣menced to promote useful Mirth and Good-humour, it shall never deviate from those Principles; to secure which in my own Temper, and to sow their Seeds in others, I shall here beg Leave to say a few Words to my Friends, the CRITICS.</P>
<P>It is observed by Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> in the very sensible Pre∣f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> to his Works, that both Writers and their Readers are generally unreasonable in the mutual Expectations they have of each other, the former fancying the
<PB N="4" REF="15"/>World must approve whatever they produce, and the latter imagining that Authors are obliged at any Rate to please them. For my Part, I should be glad to com∣pound Matters with all the Critics of the Age; if they will abate something of their usual Severity, my De∣mands upon them for Fame and Reputation shall not be very exorbitant; and should they withhold from me that small Tribute, I hope, at least, they will allow me to make as much waste Paper as the rest of our periodi∣cal Writers and daily Historians.</P>
<P>From the latter of these, viz. our common News∣papers, I do not perceive what Kind of Advan∣tage can redound to a rational Creature, who can nei∣ther receive Instruction or Entertainment, by reading that Mr. <HI>Such a one,</HI> an eminent Cheesemonger, died at his Country House, when perhaps he is in perfect good Health in <HI>Thames-Street;</HI> and if 'Squire <HI>Rent Roll</HI> is arrived in Town with a grand Retinue, I apprehend it no way interesting to any Man breathing, except his Taylor, his Pimp, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> As there is, however, a Prin∣ciple of Curiosity inherent in our Constitutions, I shall make it my Business to administer to its Gratification by Articles of true Intelligence annexed to every Essay. In the Research of these I shall spare no Pains, and I flatter myself they will have a stronger Tendency to di∣vert Spleen and Melancholy, than dull Letters from the <HI>Hague,</HI> and fictitious Advices from the <HI>Swede</HI> and <HI>Tuck.</HI> By these Means I shall be able to variegate this Work, and render it a Paper of Entertainment, if not of Instruction, and upon all Occasions I shall think it incumbent on me to have some Regard to what is com∣monly called Stile. For, notwithstanding the present Practice, it appears to me that such Words should al∣ways be chosen as are most strongly and elegantly ex∣pressive of the intended Idea; and they should, if I am not mistaken, be combined in such an Arrangement,
<PB N="5" REF="16"/>as will not be offensive to Grammar, or unintelligi∣ble upon Perusal. To this if some little Knowledge of the World can be added, I conceive it will be an additional Embellishment, as from thence may be de∣rived some just Exhibitions of human Life, and some proper Animadversions on Men and Manners; in which Articles I may venture to affirm the Writers above∣mentioned are very deficient, they informing us no one Way of the World, unless it be that so often inculcated by them, Leading to <HI>Mr. Keith's Chapel, down Clarges-Street, and turn on the Left Hand.</HI></P>
<P>Henceforth then be it known unto all Men, whom it may concern, that we <HI>Charles Ranger,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> have under∣taken, and by these Presents do undertake, the Conduct of a Paper entitled THE GRAY's-INN JOURNAL, which Name it is thought proper to give it, on Account of the Author's Residence in <HI>Gray's-Inn.</HI> We intend that this our Paper shall be a general Critique on the Times, and all false Appearances in Men and Books; and as we have observed, that, what Dr. <HI>Young</HI> calls laughing Satire has always been most conducive to the End we propose, we are determined to exert some certain Pow∣ers called Wit, Humour, and Raillery, and we hereby advise our dearly beloved Readers to get their risible Faculties in order, reserving to ourselves, <HI>more majorum,</HI> the Privilege of being dull by Design. And it is there∣fore ordered by these Presents, that on or before <HI>Satur∣day</HI> next all Offences shall cease, or they who shall be sound delinquent shall be prosecuted according to the Laws of honest Satire, in some subsequent Essay, or be obliged to take their Trial upon Indictment in our <HI>Court of Censorial Enquiry,</HI> the Proceedings of which shall be faithfully recorded in our <HI>True Intelligence.</HI></P>

<HEAD>TRUE INTELLIGENCE.</HEAD>
<P>IN order to conduct this Undertaking with the most extensive Variety of Information, Mr. <HI>Ranger</HI> will not depend entirely upon his own Rambles, but has open∣ed a Register-Office, where all Articles of News will be given in by proper Emissaries, and entered in a re∣gular Manner by a sedate Book-keeper, so that there will be little more to do than to select from these Re∣positories. As there will frequently occur short Hints of Animadversion, which will not admit an entire Essay, I shall occasionally throw out some cursory Re∣flections dated from this Place, and I have given strict Orders to my several Agents to keep a vigilant Eye upon all Objects whatever. By these Means the Man of Modesty, stealing down the Bye-walk of Life, shall blush to find his Virtue called into Day-light, and the concealed Hypocrite stand in the Pillory of Detection. <HI>Amanda</HI> shall not coquet it with every Coxcomb she meets, nor <HI>Lothario</HI> make it his Business to ruin all female Virtue. In short, as the Satyrist expresses it, all the Actions of Men, their several Passions, their Desires, their Fears, their Resentments, their Gratifications, their Delights, and their Frolicks, shall be the miscel∣laneous Subject of my Lucubrations.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>AVING recommended myself, in my last <HI>Saturday</HI>'s Paper, to the Patronage of the male Part of my Readers, I shall dedicate the present Essay to the <HI>British</HI> Fair; and, as it is principally calculated with a View to their Service, at the same Time that it carries with it a collateral Intention of insinuating myself into their Favour, I must beg to be admitted this Morning to their Toilets, to call off their Eyes for a little Time from the dearly-beloved Mirrour, to discard <HI>Betty</HI> from her Attendance, and, in short, to exclude, for one half Hour, the whole Train of <HI>Dancing-masters, Manteau-Makers, Stay-Makers, French-Barbers, Venders of Washes,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I am aware that the Ladies will be alarmed at the Thought of being alone with <HI>Ranger,</HI> but the Reason of my desiring this Dismission of so many Favourites is, because I profess the very same Art, to which that Class of People have always aspired, that of heighten∣ing the Charms of Female Beauty; and as two of a Trade can never agree, I think it absolutely necessary to meet with no Interruption, in this important Point, from the Pertness of a Chambermaid, the Servility of Tradesmen, and the Shrugs and brisk Interjections of <HI>French</HI> Proficients, who will, no Doubt, be greatly asto∣nished to hear, that their artificial Embellishments, though they may serve, when they do not luxuariantly wanton into santastic Extravagancies, to adorn the Fe∣male Form, are yet in no Way essential; as Beauty, without such Auxiliaries, may be rendered still more attractive in the Eyes of all Men of Sense.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="20"/><HI>Horace,</HI> whom it is unnecessary to introduce to the Acquaintance of the Ladies, as <HI>Creech</HI> and <HI>Francis</HI> have taken that agreeable Office upon themselves, was a Man of the most finished Taste in all Circumstances of Life; and he tells us, in the Words of my Motto, that he shall always love his <HI>Lalage</HI> sweetly smiling, and sweetly talking; which two Accomplishments would not have been touched upon by so fine a Poet, if they did not carry with them some peculiar Charm; and I am inclined to think that in them consists the whole Train of Love's Artillery.</P>
<P>Expression has been mentioned by every elegant Writer on this Subject, as the first Ingredient in the Composition of Beauty; and certainly the more pleasing the Expression is, the more Energy will be derived from thence upon every Charm. For this Reason, the plea∣sing Smile is the best Hand-maid to an elegant Set of Features; it give numberless Graces to every Delicacy, and diffuses over the whole Countenance an Emanation of that Sweetness of Temper, which is the native Or∣nament of the Fair. To this Sentiment the witty Dr. <HI>Young</HI> has subscribed in his <HI>Universal Passion.</HI></P>
<Q><L>What's female Beauty but an Air divine,</L>
<L>Thro' which the Mind's all-gentle Graces shine?</L>
<L>They, like the Sun, irradiate all between;</L>
<L>The <HI>Body</HI> charms, because the <HI>Soul</HI> is seen.</L></Q>
<P>This Doctrine has not been established without the utmost Propriety; for surely senseless, inanimate Matter, however Symmetry, Colour and other Adjuncts, may recommend it, cannot any Way gain upon our Af∣fections. I have seen many a Picture where the Face was well turned, and the Features justly disposed, and yet all Men of Judgment have invariably concurred to pronounce the Piece extremely bad, because there were no perceptible Traces of a thinking Power within.
<PB N="10" REF="21"/>And if this Property is required in the mere Imitation of the human Face, what shall be said when it is defi∣cient in the Original? when the Appearance of a Mind, which alone can distinguish us from other sublunary Existences, and which alone can impart real Satisfaction, and excite the social Feelings in an intelligent Being, seems to be totally absent? Miss <HI>Millefont</HI> is without the nicest Proportion of Features, and without a glossy Bloom of Complexion, and yet I believe no one ever saw her sitting in a Side-Box at a Play, or dancing at an Assembly, without feeling Love and Joy in sprightly Tumult about his Heart. On the other Hand, <HI>For∣mosa</HI> has a Delicacy of Shape, and Regularity of Coun∣tenance, and still no one of Taste will hesitate to pro∣nounce her unamiable; and I will venture to assert, that she is never toasted but by those, whose Intel∣lectuals are so poorly stocked with Ideas, that they never perceive the Vacuity in others.</P>
<P>The secret Quality, from which this Difference arises, has been called by the <HI>French,</HI> a <HI>Je-ne-scay-quoi,</HI> and the Phrase has been adopted in this Country; but it is serving the Purposes of good Sense to explode so un∣meaning a Term. For my own Part (with all due Sub∣mission to better Judgments) I declare myself of that Sect of Speculatists who really believe that Women have Souls, and I am apt to imagine that the Operation of this inward Agent has no small Influence upon the outward Frame. A Poet of Eminence has sung, "the Passions in the Features are," and therefore I should think, that those Ladies, who are ambitious to appear lovely in the Eyes of Men, should some∣times sit to an intellectual Mirrour, in order to see their Affections reflected to them; by which Means they would be enabled to adjust them, to harmonize them, to keep them in regular Order, and, if I may so say, make them sit right. In my Opinion, they should be as assiduous to fashion themselves in this Point, as to
<PB N="11" REF="22"/>apply the Patch, to re-establish a disorder'd Lock, to recal a straggling Hair, to settle the Tucker, or com∣pose the Mant, since taking Care of the Movements of the Mind, is also regulating the Features.</P>
<P>From this will naturally result the next Essential to Beauty, the Manner of Talking agreeably, than which Accomplishment nothing can so much enliven the amia∣ble Sex. We are pleased to see a beautiful Pair of Lips in Motion, when every Thing that comes from them administers to the Pleasures of Conversation; the Spirits of the Fair are awakened by the Exercise of their thinking Faculties, and the Eye beams with double Lustre; the Tongue confirms, what the Countenance had before indicated, that all within is sprightly, chear∣ful, gay, spirited, and sensible. The Scene is frequent∣ly shifted to our Imagination; we are delighted to observe the Celerity, which distinguishes itself in the Operations of the Female Understanding, and the quick Succession of Ideas, which they call up, amuses with pleasing Variety, while the Beauties of the Mind and Face mutually exalt each other, and we stand convinced of the <HI>Platonic</HI> Tenet, that <HI>good</HI> and <HI>beautiful</HI> are the same.</P>
<P>There are three Things highly pernicious to the En∣dearments of Beauty, from which I must absolutely interdict those, who are willing to become my Pupils. The Enemies to Loveliness, which I mean, are GAMING, SCANDAL, and POLITICS, surer Destroyers of every Elegance and Bloom, than a Spotted Fever or the Small-Pox; as chronical Diseases are more fatal to the Constitution, than a transitory Fit of an acute Illness.</P>
<P>With Regard to the first of these Corrosives, I leave it to the fair Votaries of Fortune to consider how the winning Graces and the attractive Smile can irradiate the Countenance, when the Internal is disturbed by
<PB N="12" REF="23"/>Anxiety and Solicitude, which soon transpire into the Face, and prey upon all their Charms. Besides, when the Temper is disconcerted, Politeness and Good-man∣ners are in Danger of being neglected; and while every one is intent upon the After-game, which is the fashion∣able Term for that Clash of Tongues, frequently heard in one loud Din, as soon as the Deal at <HI>Whist</HI> is out, it is not probable that the Fair can converse in a Manner suitable to the Softness and Elegance of their Sex.</P>
<P><HI>Scandal</HI> always carries with it a dreadful Efficacy to ruin a delicate Face, because it generally springs from Envy or Malice, which are both entirely against my Rules for acquiring and preserving Beauty, as they are inveterate Habits, the Traces of which are apt to wear themselves into the Complexion, inducing Frowns, Wrinkles, Roughness, and a settled Appearance of Ill∣nature, of all Things the most unamiable.</P>
<P><HI>Politics</HI> is also of pernicious Influence, tending to inflame the Ladies with Party-Rage, to cause Heats in the Face, and to occasion those Vibrations of the Fan, Bitings of the Lips, and Fidgets on the Chair, which greatly discompose the whole Form. On this Account I would have my fair Readers abstain from Parliamen∣tary Debates. And, tho' the intended <HI>Naturalization-Act</HI> has engrossed the Thoughts of the whole Nation, I think it enough for the Ladies to have secretly resolved not to marry a <HI>Jew;</HI> and without engaging too deeply in the Controversy, the sparkling Crosses, which they wear upon their lovely Bosoms, will be a sufficient In∣dication of their Principles, and will at once reflect a Lustre upon the Whiteness of their Skins, and the Delicacy of their Sentiments.</P>
<P>In what has been premised, I would have it remem∣bered, that I do not mean to recommend a studied Simper, or a restless Exertion of Chit-Chat, but I
<PB N="13" REF="24"/>would have both to be a natural Effusion, from the Sources of Good-nature and Good-sense, which, I am convinced, will be found a better beautifying Cream, than any Cosmetic advertised in our News-Papers; and therefore instead of lying-in for a new Face, or using any other Artifice, my Precept to the Ladies, is, BE GOOD-HUMOURED FOR A COMPLEXION; and I now give Notice, that I shall carefully observe, in all public Places, what Ladies repair a decayed Visage, or add new Graces to a blooming one, by this Receipt, and that I shall insert an exact List of the same in the Articles of News, which I shall serve up weekly to regale my Customers.

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Friends and Critics,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I am always pleased, in a particular Manner, to em∣brace every Opportunity of assembling you together; and as the invariable Rule of my Conduct has ever been to infuse a true Spirit of Criticism into the Minds of my People, I the more joyfully open the Sessions at pre∣sent,
<PB N="14" REF="25"/>as I make no Doubt but your Debates will be carried on with such Unanimity of <HI>Spleen, Cavil, Malice,</HI> and <HI>Ill-nature,</HI> as cannot fail to render us the Wonder of our Countrymen.

<Q><L>Quis novus bic nostris successit sedibus hospes,</L>
<L>Quem sese ore ferens? —</L>
<BIBL><HI>VIRG.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Papers which I have hitherto publish∣ed, were chiefly intended to open a Way for the better Execution of this Under∣taking, as Pioneers are dispatched to clear the Country for the main Body of an Army; and in the same Light I beg that the present Lucubration may
<PB N="15" REF="26"/>be considered. I find, since the Commencement of the <HI>Gray's-Inn Journal,</HI> that I have been the Subject of much Conversation in this Metropolis: The Critics, it seems, are busy in their Enquiries after the Author. Does any body know him? — Has he been long upon Town? — Has he any Thing in him? — What Sort of a Man is he? — These and many other Questions of the same Nature are the Topics at present; and tho' at first setting out I thought to evade an Account of myself, having had always a strong Antipathy to any Thing that might border upon the ridiculous Character of an Egotist; yet such is the Prevalence of Custom, that it is now become a Tribute due from every Adven∣turer in this Way, and therefore I shall wave the Re∣solutions I have taken, and will at present gratify the Reader's Curiosity.</P>
<P>I am of the sprightly Family of the <HI>Rangers,</HI> who have made a distinguished Figure, in this Country, ever since the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> II. and am a near Relation to my Namesake in the Play, whom many of my Readers have often admired when personated by Mr. <HI>Garrick.</HI> Though I do not at present ascend by Lad∣ders of Ropes into honest Men's Houses, yet, under a few Restrictions, I still bear some similar Habits of his Humour. My Education was at <HI>Eton,</HI> where I imbibed my first Tincture of Letters; though, to tell the Truth, I was chiefly remarkable, at that Place, for running out of Bounds. I scarcely passed over a Week without paying a Visit to <HI>Windsor.</HI> I was delighted in the Castle with the bold Imagery which the Touch of <HI>Verrio</HI>'s Pencil has poured fourth to the Eye, and to see the Canvas every where glowing with mimic Life was pleasing to my young Imagination.</P>
<P>At length, with the Character of a wild Lad that had <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> enough, I was removed to the University, where I maintained the same Reputation for five Years. Whatever was the Reason of it, I never could adopt any Party-Principles, and those whom I per∣ceived
<PB N="16" REF="27"/>attached to Prejudices of either Side have always appeared to me in very ludicrous Colours. I have known a <HI>Jacobite</HI> drink himself out of his Health and Fortune for the Good of his Country, and I have seen a very worthy Gentleman reduced to Necessity by squandering his Substance in Elections, to keep out the Pope, the Devil, and the <HI>French</HI> King. I believe there cannot be a more ridiculous Character than that of a <HI>State Quixote,</HI> who having Affairs of Moment to himself and his Family, generously neglects his own Concerns to take Care of his Country, which would be in every Particular as well without such a Patriot.</P>
<P>For my part, I have no Manner of Taste for Poli∣ticks; the Election of the King of the <HI>Romans</HI> does not concern me, nor do I trouble myself about the Window∣light Tax, provided the Prices at the Play-House are not raised upon us; and as to a standing Army, twen∣ty thousand Red-coats shall give me no kind of Trou∣ble, while they plant no Bruisers in the Pit to over-rule our Decisions. Should any such Attempts be made upon the Birth-right Privileges of an <HI>Englishman,</HI> I shall then be as warm a Patriot as the best of them. Not even the Freedom of both Houses shall buy me off; and I have now lying by me several Essays on History, and the <HI>British</HI> Form of Government, which in that Case shall see the Light.</P>
<P>These are the Principles I have contracted with Re∣gard to Matters of State; as to my Person, I beg Leave to be silent on that Head, as I do not chuse to receive any Proposals for Marriage, which I am told have been publickly solicited by a certain daily Writer. Thus much I will hint, I am now in the two and thirtieth Year of my Age, and, after having taken the Tour of <HI>Europe, Gray</HI>'s <HI>Inn</HI> is become, in <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s Language, <HI>the Sea-mark of my utmost Sail.</HI> I have been registered according to the Police in <HI>Paris,</HI> and, like Sir <HI>Harry Wildair</HI> in the Play, have play'd at Hot∣cockles
<PB N="17" REF="28"/>with an whole Convent of Nuns in <HI>Italy:</HI> In short, I have gone through all the Variety of Manners and Diversions in each different Country, and now be∣hold your Beau up to the Ears in Ink. I look upon the Gardens belonging to this Society to be the Seat of the Muses: Here the great <HI>Bacon</HI> passed his con∣templative Hours; and here, at an humble Distance, the present Writer purposes to follow his Steps.</P>
<Q>—Longe sequere, &amp; vestigia semper adora.
<BIBL><HI>STATIUS.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P>The Day I do not take a Turn in the poetic Ground just mention'd, I feel the most aukward Sensations, and fancy to myself that I breathe with Difficulty. This I must own is an Oddity in my Temper, but Habit has now confirmed it. However, I shall make it subser∣vient to the Design of this Paper, as it will afford me an Opportunity of collecting Materials for these Lu∣cubrations; and, among the Number that frequent this Place, I shall be able sometimes to glean a few Characters for the Amusement of my Readers. Be∣sides this, I belong to a Club of <HI>Originals,</HI> which meets, once in each Month, at the <HI>Devil-Tavern,</HI> near <HI>Tem∣ple-Bar.</HI> Every Member of it is remarkable for some Peculiarity in his Manners and Way of thinking, and this not contracted by an affected Imitation of others, but absolutely inherent and native to the respective Persons. I shall take a proper Opportunity to bring the Town acquainted with this Society, and perhaps may deduce from their Assistance such Matter, as will not be disagreeable to my Reader.</P>
<P>I must add to what has been said, that I have from Nature a very extraordinary Talent, which, as it will be of Use hereafter, I will here explain. I have been remarkable from my Infancy for a most surprizing Skill in Physiognomy, and have had, from my greener Years, the sharpest Discernment into the Passions of Men from the Survey of their Countenances. This
<PB N="18" REF="29"/>Faculty has grown up with me, and it is now arrived to that Degree of Penetration, that I can, by infallible Rules, read the Thoughts of People. When a Critic talks of <HI>Longinus,</HI> I can often perceive, by the Cast of his Eye, that he never looked into him; and in all Decisions upon Stile, Language, and Authors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I can discover, with a Glance, the secret Springs of Action and the latent Prejudices lurking in their Minds. Of this more another Time. As to the News, I shall receive frequent Contributions from a particular Friend, who is every Way qualified for that Branch. His Name is <HI>Harry Wildair,</HI> and I am confident he will conduce a good deal to enliven this Paper.</P>
<P>Having thus far explained myself, I will conclude with a few Resolutions which I have taken for the better conducting this our <HI>Gray's Inn Journal.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Resolved,</HI> That this Author shall not be the Tool of any Party whatever.</P>
<P><HI>Resolved,</HI> That he shall not, like the gay <HI>Inspector,</HI> trifle with his Readers <HI>over his Tea,</HI> or <HI>washing his Hands,</HI> but that he shall exert his best Endeavours for their Entertainment.</P>
<P><HI>Resolved,</HI> That he shall always have some visible Subject, and some little Regard to the Order and Pro∣priety of his Words.</P>
<P><HI>Resolved,</HI> That the Mottos to be prefixed to the Es∣says shall not be taken at random out of the <HI>Gradus ad Parnassum,</HI> but that they be selected from some good Author, without bad <HI>Latin,</HI> false Quantity, and bearing some Reference to the Point in Hand.</P>
<P><HI>Resolved,</HI> That no indecent Liberties be taken with the Character of any Gentleman or Lady.</P>
<P><HI>Resolved lastly,</HI> That he shall not indulge himself in any impertinent Vanity about himself, his Intrigues, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but that he shall, to the best of his Power, make good Sense the Rule of his Writings, according to the Maxim in <HI>Horace.</HI></P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Operations of the human Mind are at all Times extremely subtile, and while we compound, vary, and associ∣ate our Ideas into so many different Combinations, the Workings of the Soul are not attended to, and the Traces they leave are so delicate, that they are afterwards scarcely to be percei∣ved. I do not think this Phaenomenon in the ideal World is at any Time so surprizing, as in those Mo∣ments, when the Faculties of bodily Sensation are lulled in Sleep; then the Imagination calls forth her abstract∣ed
<PB N="21" REF="32"/>Train, and, being free from the Incumbrance of Flesh, disports herself in the most whimsical Manner, and is at Liberty to form what Appearances, what Scenery, what Imagery, and what Reasoning she thinks proper. This I experienced in a lively Manner the other Night, and as I cannot help believing that any of my Readers would have been glad to enjoy the same visionary Scene, I shall, instead of a formal Essay, make my Dream the Subject of this Day's Paper.</P>
<P>I retired home to my Chambers a few Evenings since, in a very poetical Mood, and, to gratify the pre∣sent Course of my Ideas, took into my Hand <HI>Virgil</HI>'s <HI>Georgies,</HI> which has always been considered by the Critics, as the most perfect Poem, of the most ac∣complished Poet The Delicacy of Expression, and every refined Beauty in the Turn of the Stile, have been finely treated by the elegant Mr. <HI>Addison;</HI> and, for my Part, I never look into it, but I perceive some con∣cealed Stroke, which had before escaped me. But the Enthusiasm which animates the following Passage, struck me the other Night in a Manner which never hap∣pened to me before.</P>
<Q><L>Me quoque Parnassi deserta per ardua dulcis</L>
<L>Paptat amor; juvat ire jugis, quâ nulla priorum</L>
<L>Castaliam molli divertitur orbita clivo.</L></Q>
<P>The Fire and Rapidity in the first Line, and the Rap∣ture and Air of Inspiration in the succeeding one, must warm any Imagination, that has but the least Spark of Fire. I could not help dwelling on it with Admiration; it opened to my Mind a Train of Images which gave me the most exquisite Pleasure, and made such an Impression on my Spirits, that even in Sleep they continued to flow in the same Traces, they had before been thrown into, and thus my waking Thoughts were recalled to me with double Delight.</P>
<P>I thought that of a sudden I was hurried away to the Realms of <HI>Parnassus,</HI> and that I towered with
<PB N="22" REF="33"/>Rapture over the several Cliffs, which are frequent in those Regions. The Air, methought, seemed to be clearer than what I have ever met with; the Skies were brightened into the purest Azure; the Sun darted his genial Rays all around, and different Streaks of Light blending themselves in sundry Parts of the Hemisphere served to diversisy the Scene; the Country smiled in vernal Delight, covered with the most chearful Green I had ever beheld. In one Part was displayed to View an ample Lawn, stretched to such a Length, that the Eye lost itself; on the other Side presented themselves Meads and Gardens, and Laurel Groves. Hills there were, whose blue Tops grew fine by Degrees, and lessened to the Sight amid the Clouds. From one of these issued the <HI>Pierian</HI> Fountain, which, divided into several Rills, came tinkling down the Mountain, and at the Bottom all assembling into one general Reservoir, they there expanded themselves into a pleasing Surface, and formed a River, which watered all the Country round. Here I fell into that State of Mind, which is so excellently described in the <HI>Pleasures of Imagination.</HI></P>
<Q><L>—Then the inexpressive Strain</L>
<L>Diffuses its Enchantment; Fancy dreams</L>
<L>Of sacred Fountains, and <HI>Elysian</HI> Groves,</L>
<L>And Vales of Bliss; the Intellectual Pow'r</L>
<L>Bends from his awful Throne a list' ning Ear,</L>
<L>And smiles; the Passions gently sooth'd away</L>
<L>Sink to divine Repose, and Love and Joy</L>
<L>Alone are waking; Love and Joy serene</L>
<L>As Airs that fan the Summer.</L></Q>
<P>I felt the most ardent Ambition to gain the Summit of the Hill, but it was in several Places so sleep, that I be∣lieve I should never have reached it, if <HI>Apollo</HI> had not been favourable to the humble Prayer which I prefer∣red. I did not build my Supplication upon any Merit in the literary World, but humbly presumed upon the
<PB N="23" REF="34"/>Delight which I always took in Works of Genius; and in <HI>Apollo</HI>'s Eye, the next Thing to a good Author is to have a Taste and Relish for the Beauties of fine Wri∣ting. I was struck with reverential Awe at the Sight of the God of Wit; and such Melody filled my Ears, such divine Harmony enchanted the Place, that I in∣stantly fell on my Knees, and worshipped the nine har∣monious Maids, who caused the heavenly Strain. They beheld each other with an Air of mutual Affection and Complacence; their Eyes were bright with Meaning, and I thought that, in Delicacy of Shape and Feature, they had a near Resemblance to two Ladies known to the World by the Name of the HIBERNIAN BEAU∣TIES.</P>
<P>After paying sufficient Adoration, I withdrew from the Presence of the Deities, and went round the Place, in order to view the Country more particularly. The greatest Part of these Regions is portioned out by <HI>Apol∣lo</HI> into different Tenures, some of them conveyed to the Person for ever, others for Life, and many for a shorter Duration. There are Mansion-houses built on many of these Estates, and the great Genius's, who have made a Figure in the World, have here fixed their Residence.</P>
<P>The Ancients seemed to have by much the largest Possessions, though a great Part of their Property was transferred to the Moderns. <HI>Dryden,</HI> besides his own hereditary Estate, had purchased a large Scope of Ground from the celebrated <HI>Virgil,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has bought near half of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Rent-Roll. Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> spent most of his Time in writing Prefaces and Dedi∣cations to the great Men of <HI>Parnassus,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> was retired to his own House, which was situated on the Banks of the River already mentioned, and the Country adjacent was laid out in the most exquisite Taste. Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> was formerly very attentive to the Improvement
<PB N="24" REF="35"/>of his Land, and where the Soil did not yield sponta∣neously, he assisted with Hot-beds. This Turn was now quite over with him, and his chief Care was to embel∣lish a Temple of Virtue and Happiness, which he had raised in the Middle of his Garden.</P>
<Q><L>There his Retreat the best Companions grace,</L>
<L>Chiefs out of War, and Statesmen out of Place.</L></Q>
<P>In Company with these celebrated Personages he main∣tained his own Ease and Dignity; and though his Soul glowed within him, when sitting with <HI>Bolingbroke</HI> and <HI>Marchmont,</HI> he seemed to receive a more near Delight from his <HI>Gay</HI> and <HI>Parnell.</HI></P>
<P>The great <HI>Shakespear</HI> fat upon a Cliff, looking abroad through all Creation. His Possessions were very near as extensive as <HI>Homer</HI>'s, but, in some Places, had not re∣ceived sufficient Culture. But even there spontane∣ous Flowers shot up, and in the <HI>unweeded Garden, which grows to Seed,</HI> you might cull Lavender, Myrtle, and Wild Thyme. Craggy Rocks, Hills, and Dales, the Woodland and open Country, struck the Eye with wild Variety, and o'er our Heads roll'd Thunder, deep and awful, and the Lightning's Flash darted athwart the so∣lemn Scene, while on the blasted Heath, Witches, Elves, and Fairies, with their own <HI>Queen Mab,</HI> play'd in frolic Gambols. Mean time the immortal Bard sat with his <HI>Eyes in a fine Phrenzy rolling,</HI> and Writers both in the Tragic and Comic Stile were gathered round him. <HI>Arisctle</HI> seemed to lament that <HI>Shakespear</HI> had not stu∣died his. Art of Poetry, and <HI>Longirus</HI> admired him to a Degree of Enthusiasm. <HI>Otway, Rowe,</HI> and <HI>Congreve</HI> had him constantly in their Eye, and even <HI>Milton</HI> was looking for Flowers to transplant into his own Paradise.</P>
<P>I was called off from surveying the Possessions of the immertal <HI>Shakespear,</HI> by repeated Peals of Laughter,
<PB N="25" REF="36"/>which resounded from an adjacent Grove. This, I soon perceived, was occasioned by the irresistible Hu∣mour of <HI>Lucian, Cervantes,</HI> and <HI>Swift,</HI> while, at some Distance from them, <HI>Rabelais</HI> threw himself into a thousand antick Attitudes, and brought together the most ludicrous Assemblage of Ideas, with all the spright∣ly Frolick of his wild Imagination.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Richard Steel</HI> fixed his Residence under Mr. <HI>Addison</HI>'s Roof, where <HI>Tickell</HI> was encouraged to tran∣slate a Book of <HI>Homer,</HI> and <HI>Phillips</HI> was assisted in finish∣ing the <HI>Distressed Mother. Addison</HI> had before him se∣veral of the periodical Essays, which have lately been sent abroad into the World, among which, methought, I saw a Paper entitled the <HI>Gray's-Inn Journal,</HI> when *********************.</P>
<P>The Effect this had upon me was such, that my Vision was immediately dissipated, and I awaked in the most pleasing Serenity of Mind.</P>

<BIBL><HI>VIRG.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> FIND myself obliged to postpone the Essay I intended for this Day, by an Occur∣rence of such a Nature, that I think it in∣dispensably incumbent on me to take some Notice of it. I did not imagine, before this Incident, that a cold, trifling, frothy Writer, could have drawn so much from me; but in the Defence of Truth, Justice, and good Sense, I cannot controul myself from it; and as he has thought proper to record a Fact, I will in my Turn begin with one of as glaring a Die as I have ever known.</P>
<P>By these Presents then be it known unto Posterity, that in the Year One Thousand Seven Hundred and Fifty-two, there really did exist a daily Author, who arrogated to himself the Title of <HI>Inspector General</HI> of <HI>Great Britain;</HI> that under this pompous Appellation he took upon him to prescribe Fashions to the Ladies, and Wire-Wigs to the Gentlemen; Intrigue to Rakes, and Taste to pretty Fellows; that he pester'd the Town with Dissertations on Fossils, Minerals, and Insects, that never existed but in his own Imagination, and from thence (emboldened by a kind of negative Ap∣plause, that of being endured) he rose a Degree higher, and at a Time when our theatrical Entertainments were
<PB N="28" REF="39"/>under the justest Regulation, did his Endeavours to sow the Seeds of Discontent in the Minds of the Au∣dience, to soment Divisions among them, and, contrary to all Law, to raise a Riot at the Theatre-Royal in <HI>Deary Lane,</HI> and in a public Paper absurdly encouraged them to throw the Sconces and Benches on the Stage.</P>
<P>It is hard to imagine to one's self the Ideas that will occur to Posterity upon Perusal of this most extraor∣dinary Passage: they will, I am afraid, believe their Ancestors, at this Period relapsing into the antient <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the first Inhabitants of this Island. I have examined the Index to the <HI>Spectator,</HI> to the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> and <HI>Guardian,</HI> for the Words <HI>Riot, Benches, Sconces,</HI> &amp;c. and I cannot find any Thing of the Kind recommended under any of those Heads, nor do I be∣lieve such an Outrage to common Sense was ever offer∣ed in any civilized Nation of the known World. The Authors of the immortal Performances just mentioned endeavoured to cherish Good-humour, Good-nature, Social Harmony, and Good-manners. Theatrical Me∣rit in their Time was promoted to the greatest Elegance; every Thing that carried with it the least Tincture of a vitiated Taste was by them attacked with the most masterly Strokes; and now this Essayist would turn the Tables upon these approved Geniuses, and, by extin∣guishing all Sparks of Emulation, destroy the only Means of heightening our public Entertainments, and disabolishing Sense and Refinement among us</P>
<P>As I generally like to trace Things to their Source, I have been considering what could be the Motives that induced his <HI>Inspectorship</HI> to this Proceeding, and I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I may take upon me to say I have disco∣vered the latent Cause. This Prodigy of Genius, this florid, witty, elegant, sensible, unexhausted <HI>Inspector,</HI> owed the first Dawnings of his immoderate Fame (I
<PB N="29" REF="40"/>blush to tell it to a Pantomime Entertainmnt. And shall he whose Monster-breeding Brain spawn'd <HI>Orpheus</HI> and <HI>Eurydice,</HI> in whose Head,
<Q><L>Hell rises, Heav'n descends, and dance on Earth</L>
<L>Gods, Imps and Monsters, Music, Rage and Mirth,</L>
<L>A Fire, a Jig, a Battle and a Ball,</L>
<L>'Till one wide Conflagration swallows all.</L>
<BIBL><HI>POPE.</HI></BIBL></Q> Shall he look tamely on, and see his favourite Monsters exposed to Ridicule? May he not have some wild Production still in Store? Such a Genius never can have done, and hence all that laboured Impotence of Ani∣madversion which he has thrown out in two different Papers.</P>
<P>But to be a little more serious. It is certain, that two contending Theatres have always indulged them∣selves in Strokes of Pleasantry upon each other; the <HI>Impromptu</HI> of <HI>Moliere</HI> was a Banter upon a rival House in so polite a Place as <HI>Paris,</HI> and a recent Instance will evince, that Mr. <HI>Rich</HI> has no Aversion to the Practice: It is notorious that a few Winters since he engaged a Person whose Abilities consist solely in Mimickry, publicly to burlesque, as far as in him lay, Mr. <HI>Garrick,</HI> as a Man, an Actor, and a Manager. He has always given oblique Allusions whenever they came in his Way, and nothing has escaped him from the Coronation in <HI>Harry</HI> the Fourth, down to the Ballad in <HI>Harlequin Ranger.</HI></P>
<P>And shall not the Manager of the other House have leave to amuse the Town in his Turn? It is ac∣knowledged by the Writer who has occasioned my taking the Pen in Hand, that <HI>the Objects are well dis∣posed; there is Humour in the Management of them, and there is Merit in the Song that explains the Design of their Introduction; what is more, there is Justice, for the Subject
<PB N="30" REF="41"/>is worthy Ridicule.</HI> In saying this he advances nothing but the Truth, but when he adds, <HI>Where is the Modesty of arraigning the Taste of an Audience, to an Audience,</HI> &amp;c. and again, <HI>It is unjustifiable, it is cruel, it is not to be supperted:</HI> In the Name of Common Sense, what wou'd he be at? First, there is Merit in it, then it is not to be justified; there is Humour in it, then it is not to be supported; there is Justice in it, and the next Moment it is cruel. For Heaven's sake, Mr. <HI>In∣spector,</HI> learn to be a little consistent, and don't thus trifle with our Understandings.</P>
<P>When a Man will write in this shuffling Manner, blowing hot and cold, saying and unsaying; when an Author, who pretends to instruct, will run off from the Point, in a snip-snap Stile, with pert Question and Answer, down a whole Column of his Paper, it is not eligible to follow him further; therefore let his meandering Briskness run what Riots it will for the future, I shall here state this Matter in a proper Light, and then have done with Controversy.</P>
<P>Nothing, in my Apprehension, shews the Temper of this Nation, more than the Ferment their Minds are thrown into by little Divisions of this Nature. A real, or a mock Monarch, a Minister of State, or a Ma∣nager of a Theatre, must eternally embarrass their Thoughts. Every Thing among them must be a Party-business; whereas, in my Opinion, while their Liberties remain inviolate, they should know no Party, but a Party of Pleasure, and all Differences betwixt <HI>Tweedle-Dum</HI> and <HI>Tweedle-Dee</HI> should be subservient to their Merriment. The Field of Humour is open to both Play-Houses, and if, without Animosity, they will cull from thence, the Result must be, that the Public will receive more Entertainment from a spirited Emulation than from an inactive State. This is the Case among the <HI>French</HI> to this Day, and those who
<PB N="31" REF="42"/>weep one Night at a Tragedy of Genius, are sure to laugh at the same Piece, the Evening following, at the <HI>Italian</HI> Comedy. And if this Liberty is taken with the noblest Productions of the human Mind, why so much Tenderness for what is really ridiculous and unfit for the Stage? The <HI>Dramatis Personae</HI> exposed to Derision, on this Occasion, are, if I am not mistaken, a <HI>Lyon,</HI> a <HI>Bear,</HI> a <HI>Cat,</HI> a <HI>Dog,</HI> a <HI>Monkey,</HI> a <HI>Serpent,</HI> and an <HI>Ostrich;</HI> an admirable Company of Comedians truly! but are they such respectable Personages, as to claim an Exemption from the Lash of Ridicule?—Ay, but <HI>Poor Rich! Poor Rich!</HI> — If by that pathetic Exclamation is meant that he is an Object of Compassion, I own I have always thought him such, and do from my Heart most sincerely pity him. But if, through a Depravity of Taste, or Debility of Mind, he has no Relish for the sublimer Compositions of a Theatre, let not us therefore, like <HI>Egyptians,</HI> worship Serpents, Dogs, and Monkeys; but, on the contrary, let us by the Assistance of the politer Arts efface all Traces of Barbarism, and preserve in all our public Exhibitions, a manly Af∣fection for the Cause of Dramatic Poesy, of Genius, and of <HI>Shakespear.</HI></P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N a former Paper, in which I gave some Account of myself, I was not in jest when I told my Readers, that from a natural Sagacity of Sight, improved by Experience and Study. I had made a surprising Profi∣ciency in the Art of Physiognomy. Among my pri∣vate Acquaintance I have acquired such a Reputation in this Way, that I have known many Ladies, who would no more dare to come into my Company, than the young Romp, in <HI>Swift</HI>'s Vision, would venture to stroke the Parish Lion, after she had play'd at Hide and Hoop with <HI>Jackey</HI> in the Garret. Notwithstand∣ing this, I am sensible, the Majority of Mankind at this Day treat this Art as a mere exploded Imposture, like Astrology and Palmistry, imposed upon the Credulous in dark and ignorant Ages. With them a Physiogno∣mist and a Conjurer meet with the same Degree of Respect and Credit. But this Objection, I believe, will quickly vanish, when we come to consider the Principles and Foundation on which the Art is esta∣blished. I might here aptly bring in the Story of <HI>So∣crates</HI> and the Physiognomist, but it is known to every Body; besides, Reason alone, and not Authority, is what I proceed upon.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="46"/>The great and almost incredible Wonder of this Ta∣lent, consists in being able to discover the Passions, Virtues and Affections, even at the very Time that they are dormant in the Breast; so as to point out a knavish Citizen at his Prayers; to know a Cut-throat, tho' he smiles; or a Fellow that has a Design upon your Fob, though he turns his Head another Way with an affect∣ed Vacancy of Face; to mark out a Fellow whose Mouth is open only to have it stop'd with a Bribe while he is declaiming against Corruption; or to detect the Niggard Hand of a Miser in the very Act of seem∣ing Generosity and Munificence. Yet all this and more may be done; and how it may be done, I will here in part explain; but I must beg to be excused, if I do not reveal some Secrets of this <HI>Arcanum.</HI></P>
<P>Every Passion, every Virtue, and their several Modes, Mixtures and Combinations, which subsist in the hu∣man Breast, have a correspondent Set of Muscles in the Face, or (if the Anatomists will not allow this) they at least operate differently upon the same Set of Muscles, which, when any Affection is Master of the Temper, are thrown into Motion, and this regularly produces a certain Configuration of Features, which is commonly known to us by the Name of <HI>Expression.</HI> This the Painters and the Statuaries can also attest, and to this they owe the very Soul of their Art; for by observing the exact Shape that each different Pas∣sion of the Mind gives the several Muscles of the Face, and by copying the same upon a lifeless Sub∣ject, it produces that agreeable Deception, which makes us imagine that this Disposition of Features is an Ef∣fect of Motion, communicated from a thinking Mind within, when it is only the Result of their Skill in the Art of Imitation. The good Player goes another Way to work; he excites in himself the inward Mo∣tions,
<PB N="36" REF="47"/>which we call feeling, and then the outward Ef∣fect upon the Countenance naturally follows.</P>
<P>The Anatomists will further inform us, that every Muscle of the human Body collects Strength, and ex∣pands itself into larger Dimensions, by continual Exer∣cise and Use; as the Legs of Chairmen and others who are used to carry Burthens, from the same Cause, swell to an uncommon Thickness. It follows then, that the correspondent Muscles of the Face, which express any ruling Passion of the Mind, being more frequently exerted, grow out of Proportion, and be∣come conspicuous above the rest. Hence the Face con∣tracts an habitual Air, marking the Features with some peculiar Cast of Character, which is legible at one Glance of the Eye. Any Body can distinguish a Miser, a Coxcomb, a Leacher, or a Glutton, in every Cir∣cumstance of Life.</P>
<P>I know some well-meaning People may be shocked at the Thoughts of indulging ourselves in the Practice of forming Opinions of Mankind by their Looks. This proceeds from a charitable Consideration, that as we make not our own Faces, we should not be ac∣countable for them; but they who think in this Way take no Care to distinguish the <HI>good Face,</HI> the <HI>ingenu∣us Vultus</HI> of the Ancients, that which <HI>Cicero</HI> says is the best Letter of Recommendation a Man can carry about him, from the <HI>Handsome,</HI> the mere Formation of inactive Features, and Gloss of Complexion. The latter is the Gift of Nature alone, and is that which the Philosophers of all Ages have persuaded us is of no intrinsic Value; but the former, which we under∣stand when we say, such a Face is not handsome, but is extremely <HI>agreeable,</HI> is in every Man's Power to ac∣quire; not by studying to put on a formal Simper, or smiling Complacency, before the Glass, but by recti∣fying
<PB N="37" REF="48"/>the Mind, and furnishing it with noble, generous, and virtuous Sentiments, which transfuse themselves into our Features, with an irresistible Persuasion, com∣manding by a secret Kind of Fascination, the Esteem of every judicious Beholder. I never knew a stronger Instance of this than in the Face of a certain Noble∣man, who, to a vulgar Eye, might appear to have an unpleasing Assemblage of Disproportion and Irregu∣larity.</P>
<P>I have observed a certain Attorney in <HI>Westminster∣hall,</HI> who, I think, has one of the <HI>handsomest</HI> Faces I ever saw; and yet, through the Lustre of his Eye, the Regularity of his Features, and Bloom of his Com∣plexion, I could read such a settled Habit of the most contracted Cunning, so many determined Purposes of Cozenage and Fraud, that I protest I could not be easy while the Fellow stood within Arms-length of my Pockets. Yet, to my Astonishment, upon Inquiry, I learned that several great Families had intrusted this Man with their most important Affairs.</P>
<P><HI>Eugenio</HI> is neither happy in a Face nor a Person; and, at the Time he should have learned to dance, was unfortunately employed in forming his Mind upon the Model of the Ancients. Hence he has contracted an uncouth Air, a College Look, and an aukward De∣portment; yet, through all these Disadvantages, and a Cloud of uneasy Circumstances, the judicious Eye can discover a Soul within capable of displaying the most <HI>divine Attributes of his God,</HI> with a Sublimity inferior to nothing but the Subject.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, cast your Eye upon <HI>Florio. Florio</HI> is a Man of Gaiety and plausible Address. And there are some whom he hath persuaded to think him one of the prettiest Writers of the present Age. By his Dexterity in the Art of Plagiarism, he passes upon
<PB N="38" REF="49"/>the Crowd for a Man of some Learning; and I have heard himself say, that the Ladies think him a Man of Gallantry, and a Wit. No Man is more perfectly satisfied with himself than <HI>Florio;</HI> he writes with the utmost Facility, without any Manner of Subject, and this he thinks is Stile, Simplicity, and Ease. Upon the whole, one might be so far deceived at first Sight, as to think <HI>Florio</HI> a pretty Fellow. Yet look at his Countenance, can any Thing be more visible than the Furniture within? a confused Assemblage of Vanity, Arrogance, Cowardice, Dulness, Ignorance, and Con∣ceit. <HI>Florio</HI> generally wears a Gleam of Chearfulness on his Face, and yet it is visible that this is all forced, and, thro' the false Appearance, <HI>Florio</HI> has an uneasy disconcerted Temper.</P>
<P>The Mortification in <HI>Sordido</HI>'s Leg had like to have gone too far, before he could prevail upon himself to be at the Expence of cutting it off. I attended him at the Time of the Operation, which, to the Surprize of every one, he bore with wonderful Patience; but while others were admiring his amazing Resolution, I could plainly perceive by his Looks, that <HI>Sordido</HI>'s Composure proceeded from the consoling Thoughts, that he should hereafter save just half his Expences, in the Article of Shoes.</P>
<P>I could point out a certain Reverend Gentleman, who wears the most plausible Appearance of Humility, Sanctity, and Grace. Ask him familiarly how he does? and with a solemn, thanksgiving Voice, and the Whites of his Eyes turned up with pious Gratitude to Heaven, he blesses his God he is very well. Yet view his shining, jolly Countenance with the smallest De∣gree of Attention, and through this Gauze of Hypo∣crisy, you plainly discover a horrid Groupe behind, composed of Pride, Gluttony, Cruelty, and Lust.—
<PB N="39" REF="50"/>Yet I'll engage, he'll rise in his Profession, for he can cringe and flatter with the best.</P>
<P><HI>Prudissa</HI> is regular at her Devotions; she goes twice a Day to Church; she constantly has her Footman to carry her Prayer-book; yet I could observe at a Visit the other Day, that in some of her Walks, there had been more Familiarity between her and this same Footman, who then handed the Tea-Equipage, than was altogether consonant to the Character she chuses to assume.</P>
<P>The unhappy <HI>Calista,</HI> through the Persidy of the Man she once placed her Affections upon, and some Fa∣mily Misfortunes that followed after, is now obliged to <HI>endure</HI> the Embraces of one of the most detestable Leachers upon Earth; yet in <HI>Calista</HI>'s Soul, I can read the latent Traces of Chastity, Humility, and Love, blended with a Tenderness of Distress, that sometimes flows into her Eyes, and adds such a melting Softness to her native Beauty, as nothing that is human can a∣void being affected with. Yet to a vulgar Eye, the unfortunate <HI>Calista</HI> appears no better than the common Tribe of Prostitutes.</P>
<P>Not to produce any further Instances at present, I can see so clearly into the Characters and Dispositions of Mankind, that if some Folks, whose Names I could mention, do not shortly mend their Manners, I will take a general Tour through the Cities of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Westminster,</HI> and unmask every smooth-faced Villain that I meet. In the mean Time, if a certain Gentle∣man, who generally wears a laced Frock, a Bag-wig, and a long Sword, does not lay aside his Project of sacrificing to a Set of Sharpers, with whom he is to go Shares, the good natured young Nobleman, who took a Liking to him for his Honesty, I will certainly let his Lordship know the whole Affair. And if a cer∣tain
<PB N="40" REF="51"/>Lady of Distinction, who, by a Side Glance last <HI>Monday</HI> in the <HI>Mall,</HI> discovered what intimate Familia∣rities had passed the Evening before, between her and a certain handsome Fellow in a red Coat, does not instantly break off all further Commerce with him, I must immediately inform her Husband; for I cannot any longer bear to see a Man of Consequence and Sense hurt in his Honour by so consummate a Coxcomb; but further, I must inform the unfortunate Lady, that from a certain Symptom in her Paramour's Face, I can plainly foresee, he intends to make himself much hap∣pier this Night, than ever he was in her Embraces, among half a Dozen of his Companions, at the Ex∣pence of her Reputation and Honour.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> WAS sitting the other Morning in my Study, quite intent upon a Plan for some future Essay, when a Servant from a Lady, whom I have had the Honour of know∣ing for a considerable Time, broke in upon all my fine concerted Schemes. After making two or three Scrapes, he informed me, that he had Directions to wait upon me with a Card, which I think proper to transcribe here, as I look upon it to be a modern Way of writing, of which the Ancients had not the least Idea.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>Lady <HI>Tenace</HI>'s Compliments to Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> — hopes he took no Cold at the Play the other Night, — begs the Favour of his Company to play at Cards on <HI>Wednesday</HI> next.—Lady <HI>Tenace</HI> proposes to keep her Day, for the Remainder of the Winter Season, on <HI>Wednesday,</HI>—shall be glad of Mr. <HI>Ranger</HI>'s Company as often as possible.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>This Way of desiring a Man's <HI>Company,</HI> where he is not to speak five Words, has in it something extraor∣dinary; and though I am not fond of fashionable Vices, yet I could never prevail on myself to renounce
<PB N="42" REF="53"/>a Thing so essential in the polite World, as <HI>Card-play∣ing</HI> is at present; and therefore I returned for Answer, that I should do myself the Pleasure of waiting upon her Ladyship. It is not enough at present for a Man to know the World, to see into the Humours of different Peo∣ple, to discover a lively Vein of Thinking upon all Topics that may offer in Conversation; unless he has learned to lose his Money gracefully, these Accom∣plishments go for nothing, and wherever he visits, he is reckoned <HI>nothing but Lumber.</HI> Mr. <HI>Mellefont</HI> never wants Wit, and has many amiable Qualities, but not being a Card player, whenever he enters a Room, the Lady of the House is sure to receive him, without stir∣ring out of the indolent Posture in which she had com∣posed herself. "Mr. <HI>Mellefont,</HI>" says she, with her Eyes swimming between Sleep and Wake round the Room, "pray sit down, Sir.—one is so—I don't know how—this Weather."—But let Mr. <HI>Hazard</HI> with his Midnight Face make his Appearance; her Heart dances at the Sight of him, the Bell rings for the Card-Ta∣ble, and the House is in an Uproar in an Instant.</P>
<P>That I may not pass for <HI>Lumber</HI> among the Ladies, I have perused with some Attention Mr. <HI>Hoyle</HI>'s very judicious and elegant Book on the Game of <HI>Whist;</HI> by which Means I can now return my Partner's Suit, lead through the Honour, <HI>Finesse,</HI> and sometimes con∣trive to bring about an agreeable <HI>See-saw.</HI> With this profound Knowledge I was punctual to my Engage∣ment, and, that I might see the whole Ceremony of the Proceeding, took Care to be pretty early in my Visit.</P>
<P>My Lady <HI>Tenace</HI> is a Woman of perfect Good-breed∣ing, and has a very happy Flow of Spirits; her Ca∣pacity is, perhaps, as extensive as that of any of her Sex; but from a constant Habit of attending to no∣thing
<PB N="43" REF="54"/>but the odd Trick, she has not laid up so large a Store of Ideas, as she might have done by a proper Improvement of her Understanding; those Ideas which she is possessed of, are in a constant Rotation, and she never dwells long upon any Subject, but is always sure to say something lively upon every Thing that offers. Her Ladyship began to rally me with a deal of Plea∣santry upon my being a public Writer, when, as <HI>A∣pollo</HI> would have it, a loud Rap at the Door shook the whole House. I have often wondered at this strange Din, with which, even though the Entry stands wide open, our Ears are always to be stunned upon these Occasions. As the Company comes to a <HI>Rout,</HI> it is possible this may make Part of the Ceremony, and, besides the Pleasure of alarming a whole Neighbour∣hood, I suppose the Ladies may think, that, what with the Thunder below Stairs, and the Lightning in their Eyes, they sail into a Room with a greater Eclat.</P>
<P>This was the Case with Mrs. <HI>Fidget;</HI> after she had seated herself in her Chair, twisted her Body two or three Times to compose herself, adjusted the sparkling Cross upon her Neck, and given a Discharge to her Fan—<Q>Lard, my Lady <HI>Tenace,</HI> says she, I was ap∣prehensive that I should not be able to wait upon your Ladyship—My poor little Dog <HI>Pompey</HI>—the sweetest little Thing in the World—I went, Me'm, the other Morning to fetch a Walk in the Park— a fine frosty Morning it was—I love frosty Wea∣ther of all Things—and so, little <HI>Pompey</HI> was with me—and if your Ladyship was but to see the dear Creature pinched with the Frost, and mincing its Steps along the Mall—with its pretty little innocent Face—and so, Me'm, while I was talking to Cap∣tain <HI>Flimsy</HI>—your Ladyship knows Captain <HI>Flimsy</HI> —five odious Frights of Dogs beset my poor <HI>Pompey</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="55"/>all at once, Me'm—the dear Creature has the Heart of a Lion—but who can resist six at once—and so <HI>Pompey</HI> barked for Assistance, and the hideous Crea∣tures made their Escape—The Hurt my little Dog met with was on his Chest—and, Me'm, there is really Danger that an <HI>Empyema</HI> is now forming in his Side. And so, Me'm—Lard, is not <HI>Barry</HI> a fine Man?—You have seen the <HI>Rehearsal</HI> to be sure, Mr. <HI>Ranger</HI>—Well, to be sure, <HI>Garrick</HI>'s a surprising little Fellow, his Eyes have so much Life, and such Meaning, and such Fire, and he has such Variety! —They say short Aprons are coming into Fashion again.</Q></P>
<P>By this Time the Room began to fill, and it was Time to dispose the Company at their several Stations for the Night. Several Card Tables were accordingly situated in different Parts of the Room, and in an in∣ward Apartment, a Brag-Table was prepared for those who are fond of that Game. The Thoughts of the whole Company began immediately to flow into ano∣ther Channel; they who were before happy in a mu∣tual Intercourse of social Pleasure, became of a sudden secret Enemies to each other, and every one had a De∣sign on his Neighbour's Pocket. I should think this strange Scene would afford many nice Touches to the Pencil of an <HI>Hogarth;</HI> and it would not fail of being highly entertaining, to see the different Effects of the same Passion operating upon a Number of People, ac∣cording to their respective Tempers, and various Ideas of Winning and Losing. To mark this with Deli∣cacy, and to blend the private Habits of each diffe∣rent Character with it, would, in my Opinion, show a nice Discernment, and be worthy of a masterly Hand to execute it.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="56"/>After a Rubber or two at Whist, I detached myself from the Party I was joined to, in order to take a Sur∣vey of the Room, and I could not help wondering how Men, amid such a Prosusion of Charms as the Ladies displayed, could fit so cool and attentive to their Game; and I observed that the Queen of Trumps (grotesque and unnatural as the Figure is) was the <HI>Venus</HI> of every Gentleman present. It is the Interest of the Ladies not to encourage a Gamester; for if this should become the ruling Passion of the Men, the La∣bours of the Toilet are all in vain; in vain may the Fair dress themselves in Smiles; in vain heave the tender Breast; Cards have banished Love, and so adieu to the female Reign.</P>
<P>But this is not all: if this Taste continues, not only Love, but Beauty is at Stake, and the Odds are greatly against it. While the amiable, but delicate Sex, sit in painful Durance at a Card Table, the liquid Lustre of the Eye is extinguished, the Roses fade upon the Cheek, and uneasy Passions deface the Coun∣tenance. <HI>Amanda</HI> is, at present, in all the Pride of Beauty; her is Stature tall and genteel; she boasts a regular and elegant Set of Features; her Bloom glow∣ing as the Poet's Fancy; a mild Radiance beams from her Eyes; there is such an inexpressible Delicacy about her Mouth, that it is intirely the <HI>Beuche gracieuse</HI> of the <HI>French,</HI> and over her whole Countenance is displayed the most winning Sweetness; and still Cards render <HI>Amanda</HI> unamiable. The Moment she sat down to Brag, I could see the young Loves and Graces, that were ambushed in every Feature, spread their little Wings, and a disagreeable Expression immediately succeeded. I could not bear to hear so exquisite a Beauty with a confirmed Voice tell a forward young Fellow, that "truly she would not be bullied by "him;" and to see those Lips, which were framed
<PB N="46" REF="57"/>for the tenderest Purposes, gnawed with Vexation, was Matter of great Uneasiness to me. But the Sen∣sations, which Mrs. <HI>Pregnant</HI> gave me, are not to be expressed. The Emotions, which she shewed upon fix Aces being discovered in one Pack, will, I am afraid, bring her Child into the World with a convulsed Set of Nerves, and I would venture to <HI>lay an even Bet</HI> that it will be marked with a Pair-royal of Aces.</P>
<P>When a Passion for Play becomes predominant in the married State, I believe it requires no very lively Imagination to conceive the Scene that must ensue; not to mention the Ruin of a Family, their own im∣mediate Happiness is destroyed; as the Poet finely says,
<Q><L>Love shall be banish'd from the genial Bed,</L>
<L>The Night shall be all lonely and unquiet,</L>
<L>And every Day shall be a Day of Cares.</L></Q></P>
<P>I shall conclude, by congratulating with the Public, that we are shortly to have a new Tragedy called <HI>The Gamester,</HI> exhibited at <HI>Drury-Lane,</HI> in which, as I am informed, the Effects of this unhappy Turn will be set in a proper Light.</P>

<P>A Servant, in a gay Livery, brought me the follow∣ing Letter a few Days since; and as it unfolds some of the Follies, which are apt to adhere to the Ladies, I shall beg Leave to recommend it to the Perusal of my Female Readers.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD><HI>To</HI> CHARLES RANGER, <HI><ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S I perceive that you frequently detach yourself from the more serious Business of a Public Writer in order to mix with the <HI>Beau Monde,</HI> and that you still retain great Attention to the amiable Sex, as you politely call the Ladies, I must beg you will permit one of them to break in upon your Studies.</P>
<P>You must know, Sir, that I have hitherto been of that Species of Women called COQUETTES; I was initia∣ted into this Science in my greener Yearr, and the
<PB N="49" REF="60"/>whole Course of my Education conspired with other Circumstances against me. My Mamma took early Pains to train me up in this Way, and the Attendants, I had about me, all joined to infuse the same Senti∣ments into my Mind; as if they had made a Point of it, to reader me egregiously ridiculous. From a Child I promised to make a fine Woman, as the Phrase is; my Features were regular, and I must add, did not want Delicacy; and I had a Bloom that greatly enlivened my whole Countenance. The Lesson constantly rung in my Ears was, that <Q>Miss should hold up her Head —and put forth her Chest—and one Day or other, she would become a celebrated Toast, and then the Men would all be expiring for her.</Q>—This you may believe was flattering to my Fancy, and to give the last Finishing to my Accomplishments for this State of Felicity, I was put into the Hands of a <HI>French</HI> Dan∣cing-master.</P>
<P>From this Gentleman I acquired a thousand name∣less Arts of Affectation, and he not only undertook the Direction of my Carriage in the graceful Movement of a Minuet, and the more sprightly Gambols of a Coun∣try-Dance, but the Management of my Features be∣came also Part of his Concern. He let me into the whole Secret of the elevated Brow, the languishing Glance, and the sleepy Eye; he instructed me when to display the snowy Breast, to move with the easy indo∣lent Carriage, to throw the whole Person into a grace∣ful Attitude, and, after observing that it is a Thing very rare in these Kingdoms, taught me the whole Use of the Hands in every Circumstance at Cards or Conversation; though it was not without some Pains, that I attained the Method of taking Snuff with a proper Air and art∣ful Display of the Fingers.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="61"/>There are a thousand Artifices to make up for the Deficiency of Chat in Company, and in all these I be∣came as regular as a Piece of Clock-work. Add to this, that he recommended to me a great Variety of <HI>French</HI> Romances, Novels, and Memoirs of Ladies of Quality; and to complete the whole, he told me one Day with a mighty serious Air, that I really had an immense Share of Wit. In this Notion I was further consirmed by Monsieur <HI>Lojeunesse,</HI> my Hair-cutter; <Q>I assure it you, Madam,</Q> <HI>says he,</HI> as my Hair was re∣ceiving the proper Adjustment from his Finger, <Q>you have indeed ver much <HI>Esprit.</HI>—Wherever I go to dress de Gentleman, it is all dying for you.— You have dem in Chains, Madam, — pon my Vord, — just as I have dis Lock here in my Hand — pray hold your Head a leetle more aside, — and all de Ladies envy your Eclat, I assure it you, Madam.</Q></P>
<P>Charmed with these Ideas of my Person, my Breast was fired with the Love of Conquest, and the Thoughts of being a Wit quite intoxicated me; it was enough to turn my little Head; for let me tell you, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> Wit is the most dangerous Thing a Woman can think of, because it generally ruins the Share of Understanding Heaven has been pleased to bestow upon her. I was not content to say or do any Thing in the common Way, and I read <HI>Rochefoucault</HI>'s <HI>Various Thoughts,</HI> in order to retail his brilliant Sayings again in Compa∣ny; I am sure you would laugh at me, were you to see the Pains I took to distinguish myself in all Places of public Diversion. I think I remember something in a Poet that may help you to an Idea of my Be∣haviour.</P>
<Q><L>She rolls her pretty Eyes in Spite,</L>
<L>And looks delightfully with all her Might.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="51" REF="62"/>
My Heart danced within me to hear <HI>Clarinda</HI> in the <HI>Suspicious Husband,</HI> utter with an Air, <HI>Any Woman can give Ease;</HI> I disdained so poor an Accomplishment; and to cause Pain and Uneasiness was the Business of my Life. To see that the Fellows could not be easy with me, nor without me, was the Joy of my Soul; I read all our modern Comedies to glean up the Airs of the fine Women, and I was delighted, like Lady <HI>Betty Modish,</HI> to hear a tortured Lover bring out;
<Q><L>Yet for the Curse of human Race</L>
<L>This Devil has an Angel's Face.</L></Q></P>
<P>Whenever I could meet with a Man of Parts and Sense, my highest Ambition was to ensnare him; such a one I had a Pride to lead in Captivity, and in Spite of all his boasted Reason, to play upon his Passions, gave me the most exquisite Pleasure. <HI>Favonius</HI> is one of this Class; he has Understanding, without affecting it; his Wit is always tempered with good Nature and Politeness; he is as handsome as most of his Sex, and there is no Requisite in the Character of a Gentleman, but what he is possessed of. With these Accomplish∣ments he became my professed humble Servant, and though he made Love to me in a Manner hardly resi∣stible, I delighted in tormenting him; if we were at a I lay together, I took Pleasure in pointing out to him several young Fellows, whom I pretended to be charm∣ed with; one I observed had the finest Set of Teeth, and the prettiest Smile in the World; another the handsomest Forehead, and the most delightful Eyes; a third had a becoming Head of Hair, and Abundance of Wit; and though an Under-actor perhaps was on the Stage, I vowed he was a charming Man. In a Country-dance, when I perceived his Spirits elevated, I
<PB N="52" REF="63"/>have sat down of a sudden, told him I was tired, and immediately after begged of him to let me take one Turn wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h a frightful horrid Creature whom I detested.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding all this, I really was in Love with <HI>Favonius,</HI> but by my own Misconduct he has slipt thro' my Hands. The amiable <HI>Elfrida</HI> has won him by her artless attractive Beauty. <HI>Elfrida</HI> has always formed berself upon a Plan very different from mine; Assabi∣lity, Chearfulness and good Humour were the only Stratagems she had Recourse to; and these, joined to a f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne Figure and a lovely Face, have made her happy in the Arms of a Man, with whom Life will be one Scene of Endearment.</P>
<P>This Incident, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> has opened my Eyes, and I now perceive, that I have been all this Time vainly aiming at imaginary Triumphs, and that all my Arti∣fices were like the Wars of the <HI>French</HI> King in <HI>Flanders;</HI> serving merely to extend Conquests, which are after∣wards not to be ascertained. On this Account, I am now de ermined to divest myself, as fast as possible, of all my Follies, and to attach myself for the future to those Rules of Behaviour, which, I am sensible, add new Graces to the Beauty of our Sex. To convince you that I am in earnest on this Occasion, I beg you will annex to this Letter the inclosed Paper, by which you will see that I am entering upon a new Plan of Life without Delay, and your Compliance will great∣ly oblige, Sir,</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HERE is not in the whole Province of an Author, a Point of greater Difficulty to attain than what is called a good Stile, an Expression which is in every Body's Mouth, but, as I take it, very little understood by the present Critics. I shall endeavour, in this Paper, to reduce into some Sort of Order the several scattered Thoughts which recurred to my Mind upon this Subject, in a vague Manner, a few Days since.</P>
<P>The Term <HI>Stile,</HI> if I mistake not, is derived from the <HI>Stylus</HI> of the <HI>Romans,</HI> which was an Instrument used by them in Writing upon Wax, one End of it fashioned to cut the Letters, and the other formed to efface the Impression, whenever it should be judged proper. Hence <HI>Horace</HI> advises a Writer who would aspire to the Fame of being worth Reading, to turn his <HI>Stile</HI>-very often, that is, to rub out and alter the Arrange∣ment and Choice of his Words.</P>
<Q><L>Saepe stylum vertas, iterum quae digna legi sunt</L>
<L>Scripturus, —</L></Q>
<P>From this turning and altering is deducible the Mean∣ing of this Expression, which is a proper Choice of
<PB N="58" REF="69"/>Words in a regular and harmonious Disposition. This requires a great deal of Art, and without a just Sense of the Force and Beauty of Language, can never be performed in any Degree of Perfection: In some we never can perceive the least Tendency towards it, which renders their Works not very palatable to the Reader; and in those who have by Practice cultivated this Ta∣lent, it is an Embellishment to good Sense, gives a Lus∣tre and Elegance to every Thing the Author advances, and renders his Productions pleasing and inviting. I be∣lieve there are to be found several Critics, from whose Works a good plodding Head may extract very sound and sensible Observations upon all Branches of Literature; but while there are those who treat the same Subject with a delicate Touch, he must be lamentably dull that would have Recourse to the former; and while <HI>Lon∣ginus, Addison</HI> and <HI>Spence</HI> are not lost to us, the <HI>Dutch</HI> Commentators will lie mouldering on Stalls, and in the dusty Libraries of insipid Pedants.</P>
<P>To attempt to lay down Rules for the Acquirement of this Quality, might perhaps carry with it an Ap∣pearance of a tacit Declaration that I am Master of it myself, which I am far from the Vanity of believing; but it appears to me, that what Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> mentions as the chief Thing to be attended to in the Conduct of the Understanding, is also a necessary Step towards this Accomplishment. The Thing, I mean, is an Habit of <HI>Thinking in Train</HI> on whatever Subject the Mind may chuse to expatiate upon, by which Means our Thoughts will follow in a natural Order, each arising and grow∣ing out of the former, and the whole connected in all its Parts, will by these Means be a regular Composition, which at one Glance the Reader may take in and carry in his Mind. There is an Association between almost all our Ideas, and whenever one of them presents itself to the Imagination, an whole Train is wakened into
<PB N="59" REF="70"/>Life; so that if an Author has enlarged his Under∣standing, and enriched himself with a tolerable Stock of Knowledge, he need not be apprehensive but his Thoughts will offer fast enough, and that too, if he has habituated himself to the Government of his Facul∣ties above described in a regular Series. This would prevent that violent Straining very perceptible in some Gentlemen of the Quill, that Manner of flying off from one Subject to another in a wild incoherent. Man∣ner, which serves only to bewilder the Reader, who expects something of Method, and not being able to attend his Author into the Realms of Chaos and old Night, he throws him aside as a vague wandering Ge∣nius, whom he can make nothing of.</P>
<P>I am aware that what has been premised may ap∣pear to an hasty Peruser, digressive from the Matter I first set out with; but Thinking is so intimately con∣nected with what is called Stile, that it is intirely co-in∣cident with the Design of this Essay, and is so essen∣tial to a Composition, that without it Elegance can never be expected, and with it, it is odds that it will never be wanting. To furnish the Mind with Know∣ledge, is a Rule of the ablest of Critics, and Words, says he, will never be deficient to cloath our Ideas.</P>
<P>To think clearly therefore is the original Source of good Writing, and he who considers things with Per∣spicuity, will also aim at the same in conveying his Sen∣timents to others. This is the main Use of Language, and on this Account a good Writer will avoid all Affec∣tation of Glittering, all false ambitious Ornaments, all Prettinesses, all Conceits, quaint Turns, Points and An∣titheses, which never can give Strength to an Argument, and only serve to enervate and corrupt the Imagination. As no Language can possibly have a Competency of Terms appropriated to every different Idea, Recourse was had to the Metaphor; which consists in transferring the Name of one Object to another, on Account of some
<PB N="60" REF="71"/>Resemblance subsisting between them; but by this, in the Nature of Things, it never could be intended that an whole Piece should be carried on in a String of borrowed Phrases. Every body knows how cloying this Manner is in some of the most eminent Writers of the last Century; and it would not be hard to point out some of the present Tribe, who put off every Thing in such a motly Mixture of far-fetched Terms and Al∣lusions, that the Sense is hid under a Flourish of tuneful Periods, which by the injudicious is called a good Stile and a pretty Flow. <HI>Cicero,</HI> the Father of Eloquence, and the excellent <HI>Quintilian,</HI> in several Passages have condemned the two frequent Insertion of Metaphors; and <HI>Vida,</HI> who was both a Poet and a Critic, has ele∣gantly described those Writers, who disdain to express their Thoughts in the Terms appropriated to them, and though, the Subject does not require it, must need set off every Thing in the delusive Colouring of figu∣rative Language.</P>
<Q><L>Namquè aliqui exercent vim duram, &amp; rebus iniqui</L>
<L>Nativam eripiunt formam, indignantibus ipsis,</L>
<L>Invitasque jubent alienos sumere vultus.</L></Q>
<P>I believe the late Dean <HI>Swift</HI> understood the true genuine Beauties of Writing as well as any Author, antient or modern, and I would advise the Reader to open any Part of his Works, and try whether he can find any Thing of this florid Manner, that at present serves to <HI>elevate and surprize.</HI> I am convinced that no Man of common Apprehension need ever read a Sentence twice over in any of this Writer's Productions; his Method is perspicuous, and at the same time elegant, without false Embellishments, and his Metaphors all bearing a palpable Allusion to the Thing they are introduced to signify. This is a Point which should be always be
<PB N="61" REF="72"/>considered, and even then they should not be sowed too thick, nor pursued with a pitiful Ambition to too great a Length. Whenever I find a Person erring on this Head, he appears to me in the Light of a Child, who has blown a Bubble prettily variegated and pleasing to his Fancy, and then follows it in order to keep up the Illusion as long as he can. In short, it has happened in Language as in Commerce: What was first intended to supply our natural Deficiencies, is now by the Depra∣vity of the human Mind perverted into a Vice; the Transgression on the one Hand has been sufficiently condemned by all Moralists, and in the Eye of a just Critic nothing can be more blameable than a Luxury of Words.</P>
<P>I know there are many other Corruptions which con∣tribute to vitiate a true Taste; but I have dwelt longer on this, as it appears to me to be the reigning Fault of all our pretty Essayists at present. But if Me∣taphor is considered in the Light I have stated it, as only an Aid to the Perspicuity of Language; it will no longer pass for an Elegance, when it is not subser∣vient to its original Institution. Add to this, that all tedious Circumlocution should be quite exploded, tho' it is an excellent Subterfuge to him, who wants to spin out the Sheet: To be a great while saying and saying nothing, helps out many a <HI>tritical Essay</HI> Writer. A Multiplicity of Words of the same Import, with a Profusion of Epithets, is also very useful upon a Pinch, but, I believe, it is unnecessary to observe, that there cannot be a greater Error; it should also be remem∣bered, that every Species of Writing has its peculiar Manner, and its own proper Colouring, and whenever the distinguishing Qualities of each are not preserved, whenever the different Boundaries are invaded, then all Propriety in Writing is destroyed. A true Stile should be clear of all foreign Infusions, like the River
<PB N="62" REF="73"/><HI>Marsyas,</HI> which <HI>Curtius</HI> tells us glides pure and un∣mixed within the Fortifications of a Town in <HI>Asia,</HI> free from any adventitious Waters to pollute the lim∣pid Stream; but when without the Walls, it pours along with a more impetuous Current, and a swelling Surge, it no longer retains its original Name, but then commences to be stiled the River <HI>Lycus: cum extra mu∣nimenta se evolvit, majore vi ac mole agentem undas Lycum appellant.</HI></P>
<P>After the Choice of our Words, the Arrangement of them is to be attended to, and in this consists a great deal of the Writer's Art. The Reference which the several Terms in a Sentence bear to one another; the Strength they acquire by being joined with proper Epithets, the Lustre they reflect upon an whole Period when disposed with such an artful Brevity, that nothing is perplexed or entangled, are all Points of Moment in a Composition, and at the same Time that they render every Thing clearer, they give Grace and Harmony to the Whole.</P>
<P>The Particulars here insisted on are, in my Opi∣nion, the Constituents of a good St<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le, but as I am apprehensive I may have been all this Time giving a Specimen of a very bad one myself, I shall here re∣lease my Reader with this Observation, that Simplicity is the first and greatest Beauty in every Production of the human Mind.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N a former Paper I mentioned, that I belong to a Club, which meets once in every Week, at the <HI>Devil Tavern,</HI> near <HI>Temple-Bar;</HI> I then promised my Readers to make them acquainted with the Nature of this Meeting, the Characters of the several Members, and the Oddities in my own Temper, which entitle me to a Place in this extraordinary Society, and therefore I shall make an Account of it the Subject of this Day's Lucubration.</P>
<P>Our Club is called the <HI>Club of Originals.</HI> By an <HI>Ori∣ginal</HI> we do not mean, a Character entirely new, and
<PB N="65" REF="76"/>such as has never been seen in the World before; but we intend by it a Person of an independent Under∣standing, whose distinguishing Marks are not contracted by an affected Imitation of others, but are absolutely native and constitutional in the very Frame and Temper of his Mind. As I had the Honour of filling the Chair the last Club Night, I shall begin with myself, though I am aware that a public Writer should remain as much behind the Curtain as possible, on Account of the Prejudices which arise against a known Author.</P>
<P>I have, perhaps, as many Whims in my Turn of Mind, as any Man whatever, and they adhere to me so tenaciously, that I cannot disengage myself from them. Notwithstanding all the Pains I have been at, I cannot induce myself to carry a supernumerary Ace in my Pocket to a Brag-table; I could never contract an Intimacy in a Gentleman's Family, in order to debauch his Daughter, or carry on a Design upon his Wife; I had rather lose my Joke at any Time, than my Friend; and I am so aukward, that I cannot at∣tempt to bilk a Box-keeper. Add to this, I am far from being a Free-thinker, notwithstanding the very great Reputation to be acquired by it. I am sensible, that these are unaccountable Oddities, and it does not escape me, that in so enlightened and accomplished an Age as this, they must set a Man in a very disadvantage∣ous Light; but the Truth of it is, they have taken such Root in my Mind, that I am apprehensive, I shall never be able to attain that Elegance of Life and Taste, which is remarkable in some of my Neighbours.</P>
<P>The next who is to sit for his Picture, is a Gentleman of the most extensive Knowledge in all Branches of polite Literature. His Name is CANDID, remarkable for his Knowledge in Critical Learning; but what constitutes the Oddity of his Character is, that he is a <HI>Critic</HI> with Good-nature. No Man has quicker Sen∣sations
<PB N="66" REF="77"/>than Mr. <HI>Candid,</HI> and hence it results that in pe∣rusing the Works of Antiquity, or those Writers among the Moderns of allowed Reputation, their beautiful Passages strike so forcibly on his Imagination, that he admires them to a Degree of Rapture. It may be ima∣gined that this Warmth of Temper hurries him some∣times into a false Applause, but his Judgment is so deliberate, that he generally withholds his Admiration till he is perfectly satisfied that the Sentiment and Diction are just, and he is never known to be imposed upon by false Embellishments of Stile, or those ambitious Ornaments in Writing, which are censured by <HI>Horace.</HI> To this Refinement of Taste, Mr. <HI>Candid</HI> has joined the most finished good Breeding, which renders his Company extremely desirable, and he is a Source from whence those of his Acquaintance derive many excel∣lent Observations upon every Kind of different Wri∣ting.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Abraham Gulliver</HI> follows in Order of Succession to the Chair, a Gentleman of very diverting Humours, and descended, as he himself informs us, from that very <HI>Gulliver</HI> whose Travels have been collected, with so much Accuracy, by the late Doctor <HI>Swift.</HI> The Love of recounting Adventures I believe runs in his Blood, and he frequently sets the Company a staring at the surprizing Incidents he has met with. His Passion for voyaging was formerly so prevalent in him, that he never omitted an Opportunity of <HI>sailing for it,</HI> as he expresses it, and merely to gratify this Inclination he embarked in Lord <HI>Anson</HI>'s Squadron found the World. He has lost one Eye and Part of his Chin in that Expedition, but he does not repine at the Accident, as he says it is made up to him in the Acquirement of Knowledge, which, he insists, no Man can be said to possess, who has not crossed the Line, and attempted the North-East Passage. He has conversed with a
<PB N="67" REF="78"/><HI>Bramin</HI> in the East; and there is no Place in the Map, of which he cannot give some Account. He certainly has laid up a large Fund of Knowledge, but that tinged with so many Oddities, that he is a whimsical Member of Society.</P>
<P>After Mr. <HI>Gulliver,</HI> my Friend <HI>Harry Wildair,</HI> whom I have mentioned in a former Paper, as my Coadjutor in the Articles of Intelligence, claims our Attention. <HI>Harry Wildair</HI> has a quick Insight into Men and Man∣ners, and No-body better knows the characteristic Marks and latent Foibles of all whom he meets in the social Intercourse of Life. Joined to this Sharp∣ness of Discernment he has made great Enquiry into the Connections and Business of Mankind, and is actuated by so strong a Desire of Novelty, that he has fixed his Residence at <HI>Charing-Cross,</HI> that he may have an Op∣portunity of observing the mighty Throng, which is constantly pressing that Way. He can tell, by the Coat of Arms, to whom each passing Coach belongs, and if by Chance a Vehicle unobserved before occurs to him, he is sure to run after it through nine or ten Streets, in order to satisfy his Curiosity. In short, my Friend <HI>Wildair</HI> is all Spirit and Frolick; is foremost in every Scene both in high and low Life, and he is equally pleasant upon the finer Foibles of the polite, and the strong Humours of the inferior Class, from whence it results that he is never without a Fund of Gallantry and Humour, and his Conversation abounds with a gay and sprightly Variety.</P>
<P>The next of the Society is Counsellor <HI>Plastic</HI> of the <HI>Inner Temple.</HI> Counsellor <HI>Plastic</HI> was called to the Bar in the Year 1740, but the Death of his elder Brother soon rendering it unnecessary for him to attend his Profession, he laid aside the long Robe, and has since indulged himself in the Gratification of his natural Cast of Mind. Instead of Walking in <HI>Westminster-Hall,</HI> he takes a Turn every Day in the <HI>Lyceum,</HI> or
<PB N="68" REF="79"/>saunters in the Groves of <HI>Academus.</HI> In plain Terms, Mr. <HI>Plastic</HI> is a compleat <HI>Shaftesburian</HI> Philosopher; like all the Gentlemen of that inclining, he has a po∣lite Taste for the imitative Arts; his Imagination is warm and elegant, and he has entirely a <HI>Muse-like</HI> Apprehension. With all this there is a Peculiarity in every Thing he says or does; the Christian System cannot stand his Art in Ridicule, which he calls the Test of Truth, and he adores a Deity of his own making. The Doctrine of Rewards and Punishments is to him abominable, and his Discourse generally turns on Ideas of Beauty and Virtue. Besides the five Senses in com∣mon with his Neighbours, this Gentleman has a mo∣ral Sense, a Sense of Honour, a public Sense, an internal Sense, and many other Powers of Perception, not mentioned in <HI>Locke</HI>'s Essay, which is, in my humble Opinion, the most accurate History of the human Mind. In short, Counsellor <HI>Plastic</HI>'s Imagination has attained a great Degree of Refinement, and his disinterested Bene∣volence is frequently laughed at by Mr. <HI>Allcash,</HI> who stands last upon the List.</P>
<P>It is owing to a Whim of this Gentleman's, that our Meeting is fixed at the <HI>Devil Tavern,</HI> as he has made a Resolution never to go beyond the Bar. Mr. <HI>Allcash</HI> is esteemed to be worth half a Plum, and is now pretty well recovered from the Shock he received by the Reduction of Interest. As he has spent most of his Time in a constant Intercourse with Scriveners and Stock-jobbers, he has discovered the Artifices of that Class of Men, and he is satisfied from that partial View of Mankind, that he knows the World. He is extremely fond of a Maxim in <HI>Hudibras;</HI>
<Q><L>What is Worth in any Thing,</L>
<L>But so much Money as 'twill bring?</L></Q>
<PB N="69" REF="80"/>This with him is the Test of Truth, which he opposes in his joking Way to the <HI>Shaftesburian</HI> Rule; he declares, that he had rather have a Sense of Money, than all the elegant Senses above mentioned; and he is a constant Attendant at Church, as he says, from a sincere Motive of Piety, though it is hinted by Mr. <HI>Plastic,</HI> that he does this because he thinks it is his <HI>Interest</HI> to be saved.</P>
<P>These are the Members of the Club of ORIGINALS, which has been instituted upon the Commencement of this Paper, and as we are willing, in order to pro∣mote the Design of it, to admit new Members, Pro∣posals will be received, and treated with the utmost Impartiality.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE <HI>French</HI> are very often happy in an Expression, which cannot be rendered with equal Delicacy in any other mo∣dern Language. Of this Sort is a Phrase I have somewhere met with, <HI>viz. Les petites Morales,</HI> which is used by them to signify those subordinate Points of Behaviour, which cannot be look∣ed upon in the same Light with Concerns of an higher Moment, but are, however, so essential to our Conduct in Life, that they are thence denominated <HI>lesser Morals.</HI> A small Share of common Sense will point these out to every Man's Observation; but as the Infringement of them is frequent, and very often attended with serious Consequences, it properly comes within the Province of a public Writer to correct these lesser Deviations, and therefore I have set apart this Day to animadvert upon a Transgression of this Nature.</P>
<P>The Offence I mean is the notable Art of HUM∣BUGGING, which started up of late Years, and has made such an extensive Progress, that it is now enlarged into a general Fashion, and calls aloud for a CENSOR. And here it may not be improper to remind People of the true Definition of Wit, which consists in reconciling I∣deas, between which there is no palpable Congruity, in a sudden lively Association. To this I will add, that Humour is the Talent of discerning the Oddities which constitute the great Variety of Characters this
<PB N="72" REF="83"/>Kingdom is famous for, and exhibiting them in ridicu∣lous Colours to the Eye of the World. Things being thus circumstanced, I would ask the Tribe of HUM∣BUGGERS, how far a plausible Lie, with a grave Coun∣tenance, will give them a Pretension to either of the two Faculties above described? The Truth of it is, they are but pitiful Attendants on the Camp of false Wit; and if they would consider how easily it is to fal∣sify, and how hard to do it with Pleasantry, they would, in my Opinion, desist from so unpolite an Art, than which I do not remember any thing more gross, more stupid, and more senseless. An Author of the first Mag∣nitude (I think the late Dr. <HI>Swift</HI>) observes, that he never knew above one good Lie in his Life; and that one, I will venture to say, was told by himself, and we may believe was a Stroke of Humour, free from Scan∣dal or Detraction, the distinguishing Characteristicks of our modern Adventurers in this Way.</P>
<P>As one of these elegant Gentlemen is over his Tea in a Morning, his Hand is applied with great Sagacity to his Forehead — <Q>Let me see now, for an arch Hum—something cursed high for the Day—Ay, ay, I have it—A Suit is commenced in the spiri∣tual Court against a certain Lord—It will be inso∣lent though to meddle with such respectable Charac∣ters—Well, but there is Ill-nature in it, and so it will do swimmingly—as how—Why—he's mar∣ried the finest Woman in the World—Her whole Sex envy her, and Envy vents itself in Malice and Detraction—that's the Thing—it will spread a∣mong them—Immense by G—d.—</Q> So away runs he, as quick as Lightning, to my Lady TATTLE-AID's Toilet, with a Face as long as a <HI>Dutch</HI> Epigram; then the Hum begins—<Q>I am extremely sorry for it, <HI>cries the Wag</HI>—It's a cruel Case—<HI>Pray, Sir, what's a cruel Case?</HI>—Why, have not you heard,
<PB N="73" REF="84"/>Ma'am?—My Lord—(hark in your Ear)—abso∣lutely fact—two Wives—I'd lay all <HI>Lombard-Street</HI> to an Egg-shell that it's true. Your Ladyship knows <HI>Tom Wildfire.</HI>—<HI>Tom</HI> went this Morning for a Li∣cence to be married to Miss <HI>Beverley,</HI> the great For∣tune, and he brings the News piping hot from the Commons.—" "Lard, says my Lady <HI>Tattleaid,</HI> I don't know how it was — I never liked that Match —<HI>(and casting her Eyes on the Glass with a conscious Simper)</HI>—What signifies all her Beauty now?— Though she was never my Beauty—I don't find that those tall Women are so much admired in public Places — Mrs. <HI>Needlework,</HI> bid <HI>John</HI> come round with the Coach to the Door,—and bring me my Fan, Gloves, and Capuchin in an Instant.</Q></P>
<P>Thus the Affair is settled: away flies my Lady <HI>Tat∣tleaid,</HI> on the Wings of Malice, to all Parts of the Town, and thus the agreeable News is wafted about. At <HI>White</HI>'s Bets are extremely high, a Wager being the only Test of Truth, which the ingenious Gentlemen of that Academy have been able to discover, after infinite Pains in the Search. A losing Gamester, who is o∣bliged to drive into the City to dispose of a little <HI>South Sea</HI> Stock, gives the Hint there. The Gossips at <HI>Gar∣raway</HI>'s have it in a Moment: At One it is buzz'd on <HI>Change,</HI> and the circulating Whisper in the Boxes in∣terrupts the Play at Night. At my Lady <HI>Trumpabout</HI>'s Assembly, the Ladies are all in a Titter. <Q>Is it come to this? cries Miss <HI>Sparkish,</HI> I'll brag a Guinea over—" "But is it really true, says Miss <HI>Whiteteeth,</HI> I shall be very sorry for it—he! he! he!—Can one go to hear it tried?—I'll send to bespeak Places.</Q></P>
<P>Pleased with these Ideas, the Ladies retire home from the Rout, sink into a comfortable Repose, dream of Divorces, Separations, and unhappy Beauties, till the next Day the Cheat is discovered; the Illusion vanishes;
<PB N="74" REF="85"/>the noble Lord proves to be above the Reach of so in∣famous a Calumny, and his Lady, superior to Envy, moves in her Sphere with Lustre, Grace, and Dignity; while the Droll, who first set the Thing on foot, enjoys the Joke in secret, and laughs at the Tale his Faceti∣ousness propagated. And in this is contained all the Wit, and all the Humour, and all the Fun of all the <HI>Humbuggers</HI> of the Age.</P>
<P>I could wish that this Tribe had subsisted in the Days of <HI>Horace;</HI> because then we should have them, under some proper Appellation, delivered down to Posterity with the
<Q><L>Ambubaiarum collegia, Pharmacopolae,</L>
<L>Mendici, Mimi, Balatrones, hoc Genus omne:</L></Q> But I do not think that the polite Authors of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> seem to have the faintest Idea of this egregious Turn. In all the Characters of <HI>La Bruyere</HI> there is no such Mon∣ster to be found; the Wits of King <HI>Charles</HI>'s Time were absolutely ignorant of it. In the Reign of Queen ANNE, <HI>which</HI> (to use the Words of a fine Author) <HI>notwithstand∣ing the happy Days that have succeeded, every</HI> BRITON <HI>may yet remember,</HI> I say, in the Reign of Queen ANNE, when Wit, Humour, Imagination, and every elegant Talent, were in their highest Perfection, nothing of this Sort arose. In short, it seems entirely reserved to grace the Annals of these latter Days; and I make no doubt but it will give a surprising Eclat to the Pages of some future Historian, to have it related in a pompous Stile, that in the Reign of his Majesty King <HI>George</HI> the Se∣cond, by the Grace of God, King of <HI>Great-Britain, France</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> Defender of the Faith, and so forth, the never enough to be admired Art of <HI>Humbugging</HI> came into Vogue, and was the Amusement of Tea Ta∣bles,
<PB N="75" REF="86"/>the Delight of the Court, and the Study of Beaux and pretty Gentlemen, from whom it descended to all Ranks of People, and became the general Fashion of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>Instead of expatiating any further on this sprightly Absurdity, I shall close this Paper with a Passage from Lord <HI>Shaftsbury,</HI> whose Decision upon Wit and Manners, I believe, will not be contested.</P>
<P><Q>'Tis real Humanity and Kindness to hide strong Truths from tender Eyes; and to do this by pleasant Amusement, is easier and civiller, than by a harsh Denial, or remarkable Reserve. But to go about industriously to confound Men in a mysterious Man∣ner, and to make Advantage, and draw Pleasure from that Perplexity they are thrown into by such uncer∣tain Talk, is as unhandsome in a Way of Raillery, as when done with the greatest Seriousness, or in the most solemn Way of Deceit. It may be necessary, as well now as heretofore, for wise Men to speak in Parables, with a double Meaning, that the Enemy may be amused, and they only <HI>who have Ears to hear, may hear;</HI> but it is certainly a mean, impotent, and dull Sort of Wit which amuses all alike, and leaves the most sensible Man, and even a Friend, equally in Doubt, and at a Loss to understand what one's real Mind is upon any Subject. This is that gross Sort of Raillery which is so offensive in good Company; and indeed there is as much Difference between one Sort and another, as between fair Deal∣ing and Hypocrisy, or between the genteelest Wir, and the most scurrilous Buffoonery. But by Freedom of Conversation this illiberal Kind of Wit will lose its Credit.</Q></P>

<P>The following Letter is a Piece of Raillery upon Whim∣sies, which have a real Existence; and it is written by a Gentleman of so elegant a Taste, that I per∣suade myself a Production of his cannot fail to con∣tribute
<PB N="78" REF="89"/>to the public Entertainment, and therefore I shall not, by a longer Preface, detain my Readers from the Perusal of it.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD><HI>To</HI> CHARLES RANGER, <HI><ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Bill lately said to be before the Legis∣lature for encouraging Industry (however extraordinary it might be in some Particu∣lars) was, I do not doubt, extremely plea∣sing as to its general Purport to a Man of your Cha∣racter. For my Part, I have ever beheld with Pleasure the Motto, with which a certain eminent Physician has long adorned his Chariot, <HI>viz. Non sibi sed toti,</HI> and am for promoting Industry in a more exalted Signifi∣cation of the Word, than that in which it is most com∣monly used; I mean, as it tends to the Good of Man∣kind, without the least Tincture of private Advantage.</P>
<P>When very young, I remember to have read in some Author, that the <HI>Turks</HI> are obliged to exercise some Trade or Occupation, which may contribute to the pub∣lic Emolument, and that even their Emperors have no Exemption from this Institution. It is true, a certain Sultan, a Kind of Wag, very artfully evaded the Force of the Law by the following Device. The Musti, it seems, had reproved him for being so unmindful of what their Prophet had expresly enjoined, as to spend all his Time in following Hawks and Hounds. The next Morning the wily Sultan sent his troublesome Mo∣nitor an handsome Present of wild Fowl and Venison, informing him at the same Time, that being convinced of the Justness of his Reproof, he had in Consequence thereof taken up the <HI>Trade of a Hunter.</HI></P>
<P>Far from approving such a Mahometan Equivocation, I began to consider wherein I could be of the most ge∣neral
<PB N="79" REF="90"/>Use to my Fellow Creatures, without the least Regard to any selfish Views. I found myself in Posses∣sion of an ample Patrimony, and consequently a Subsist∣ence was out of the Question. As to Divinity, Law, the Navy, or Army, I was aware that they carry with them some glittering Toy, which more or less attracts the Hearts of even the most philosophic of their Fol∣lowers. A <HI>Mitre,</HI> for Example, the <HI>Great Seal, a Flag at the Main-top,</HI> or a <HI>Truncheon,</HI> have their respective Charms, and no Doubt operate accordingly on the Conduct of their several Admirers.</P>
<P>To all these Allurements, I resolutely shut my Eyes, and determined to set a noble Example, void of any the least concomitant Self-Interest. Thus resolved to dedicate my Time and Studies to the Service of Man (including Woman) I made Choice of an Occupation of universal Consequence to the World, but of which none, except a few mercenary Pretenders, have ever made public Profession. Not to keep you any longer in Suspence, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> the Profession I have taken up, and exercised for some Years, is that of a <HI>Dentifri∣cator,</HI> or what the Vulgar call <HI>a Cleaner of Teeth.</HI> I have heard with Rapture of a certain <HI>Worcestershire 'Squire,</HI> who formerly applied himself with great Suc∣cess, as well as Assiduity, to cutting and curing the Corns of all those he could persuade to make an Ex∣periment of his Skill. Not long since a noble Peer was famous for thirsting after a few Ounces of the Blood of all who came near him, not from any Cru∣elty of Temper, but purely on account of the exquisite and laudable Pleasure he took in the Use of the Lancet. Even <HI>Peter the Great,</HI> the immortal Refiner of the <HI>Rus∣sian</HI> Empire, greatly delighted in drawing the Teeth of every one, who betrayed a Pain in those Parts, by hold∣ing his Handkerchief to his Mouth, by making wry Faces, or any such Indications. Of this I have been as∣sured
<PB N="80" REF="91"/>by an Eye-witness of his Dexterity. To the common Soldiers he gave a Crown for every Tooth he deprived them of, which, indeed, encouraged so many poor Wretches, who were ignorant of the Value of their Grinders, to undergo the Operation of an Impe∣rial Hand, that the Officers remonstrated to his Majesty, that if he continued to make such Depredations in the Months of the Soldiery, he might disband his Troops, as they would be fit for Service no longer than they could eat.</P>
<P>To a Persen of Mr. <HI>Ranger</HI>'s Sagacity, I need not remark how much my Profession of cleaning, beautify∣ing, and preserving the Teeth, surpasses the inconside∣rate Zeal of that great Man. Every one is sensible how much we surpass all other Nations in the Bravery of our Soldiers, and the Dexterity as well as Intrepi∣dity of our Mariners; and yet it is well known, that all this depends on eating, and, of course, on the Goodness of their Teeth. And as to our Beaux and Belles, how much the Force of their Charms is assisted by a delicate Set of Teeth, is a Truth so evident in itself, as not to need the least Demonstration.</P>
<P>In Consequence of these Reflexions, I applied my∣self to study every Author who has wrote on this Sub∣ject. I went so far as to take an <HI>Arabian</HI> into my House to instruct me in his Language, that I might be able to consult the Writers of his Country in the Original, as well as the Authors of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome.</HI> After this I travelled over all <HI>Europe</HI> to converse with such as pro∣fess this noble and delectable Operation. I have even put myself in their Hands, in order to acquire every Excellence, as well as avoid every Defect incidental to my brother Operators.</P>
<P>Some Time since, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> you favoured us with an Account of the Progress you had made in Physiog∣nomy. You therefore will easily believe what I am
<PB N="81" REF="92"/>going to relate of my own Sagacity. By a curious and exact Observation of the various Marks on the Teeth in different Persons, from the continual Friction they undergo, as well from each other as from the Tongue and Lips, I am able to discover what Passions their se∣veral Owners are subject to, and how far they indulge them, particularly as to <HI>Anger, Envy,</HI> or <HI>Love.</HI> It's an old Remark, that Proverbs are a Kind of Test of na∣tional Wisdom, and are either literally or allegorically founded on Truths of no small Importance. Now, I need only instance a few of these pithy Sentences, to convince the most Incredulous what great Discoveries may be made by a skilful Contemplator in this Way. As for Instance, <HI>Such a one has all his Eye-Teeth;— He shews his Teeth, but cannot bite;—A third has a soft Tooth in his Head;—This good Lady has a Colt's Tooth left yet;—Another has a liquorish Tooth,</HI> &amp;c. I have made many Observations of this Nature, and even at first Sight, I can discover whether a certain Mark be out of a young Lady's Mouth or not; in plain <HI>English,</HI> whether she be in a State of pure Virginity, or has really given it up; or in what Degree of Dan∣ger she is of so doing, by the Indications her Teeth contract from being frequently applied to the Sheets or Pillows. In some I have discovered, after their having been in Company with two Sister-Graces, (a certain Dutchess and Countess that shall be nameless,) whether their Teeth have been affected by the corrosive Qua∣lities arising from Envy, or brightened by the Motion of the Lips, occasioned by the Smiles of a pleasing Admiration.</P>
<P>I have already taken up too much of your Time, and therefore decline giving you an Account of my Travels (for the narrow Considerations of Wife or Fa∣mily cannot long detain me at Home) in Search of all Opportunities of improving myself in the Art of pre∣serving,
<PB N="82" REF="93"/>and beautifying, those useful Implements the Teeth. It is true, I was lately very near aban∣doning my Profession, through the Treatment I met with from a certain great Prince in <HI>Germany,</HI> who pre∣tending to want my Assistance, no sooner got my Fin∣ger in his Mouth, than, closing his Foreteeth, he held me fast in the greatest Pain imaginable; and at the same Time he spoiled, with one of his Grinders, the nicest Pair of Ruffles, which I had made up at <HI>Versailles</HI> on Occasion of the Rejoicings for the Birth of the Duke of <HI>Burgundy.</HI></P>
<P>I am, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> with all Readiness to rub your Gums, whenever you will please to favour me with your Commands,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your very obedient Servant, And constant Reader, COURTLY NICE.</SIGNED>
<POSTSCRIPT>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HEN an Author first launches forth, a pleasing Prospect lies before him; his Spirits are enlivened with the Novelty of his Enterprize; his Imagination pic∣tures to him Scenes of Success, and he thinks he has nothing to do, but to spread all his Sails, and glide away to the Realms of Fame. Were an Insurance-Office opened for Adven∣turers of this Nature, where, for a small Premium, the Event might be ascertained, he would hardly think it worth his while to intrench himself within those Safe∣guards; so sure is he of reaching his wished for Haven. But how sorn is the flattering Dream dissipated into Air! Like <HI>Virgil's Aeneas,</HI> he no sooner leaves the Shore, and sees the Land gradually lessening to his Eye, than he finds himself embarked on a Sea of Troubles. Some secret Enemy, in whose Breast an unjust Preju∣dice has long been rankling, immediately begins to counterwork his Progress, and a Storm is raised against him. Calumny, Detraction, Scandal, and Malevolence blow a more violent Tempest, than the four Winds combined; the piercing Blasts of Enmity whistle round him, and his little Bark becomes the Sport of a trou∣bled Element; now elevated as high as the very Hea∣vens, and then at once let down to the profoundest Bottom of the Deep. Should he be hardy enough to
<PB N="85" REF="96"/>think of weathering it out, he is beset by a Shoal of Monsters, known in those Seas by the Name of CRI∣TICKS. These dangerous Animals of Prey are con∣stantly prowling about the Main, upon the Look-out, if I may be allowed the Expression, for some Object of their Rage. Him they instantly surround, and all En∣deavours to amuse them from their fell Purpose are in vain; Tubs have been thrown to Whales with Suc∣cess, and we have read of <HI>Arion,</HI> who found Means, by the lenient Airs of his Harp, to soften into Atten∣tion a Group of Monsters, hungry, and ready to devour him; but no Persuasive is sufficient to appease the Rage of the CRITICKS, mentioned above; almost in∣evitable Ruin attends the Man, who unhappily falls in their Way; and if, by the Light of some propitious Star, he should steer his Course clear of them, they have been seen to goad and bite themselves with Spite and De∣speration.</P>
<P>To descend from this long continued Allegory: A public Writer, who undertakes to instruct or entertain his Readers, has so many Difficulties to cope with, that instead of wondering at the Dearth of good Papers of late, I am surprized that any Advances are made to∣wards it. The <HI>Pangs of despised Wit</HI> are, perhaps, equal to <HI>those of despised Love,</HI> and one would imagine them sufficient to extinguish an Author's honest Emulation, and to determine him to think a Post of inglorious Ease more eligible than that State of Warfare, he must be involved in as a Writer. It is to no purpose to plead in Bar to the Invectives of the rigid Censors of the Age, a well-meant Endeavour to promote Chearful∣ness and Good-humour: An Acquaintance of mine, who delights in parodying Passages from Poets, says, with some Pleasantry, <HI>Criticks have flinty Hearts; na Wit can move them; Authors must be unhappy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="97"/>As these notable Refiners upon the Beauties of Wri∣ting stand in a conspicuous Light among the several Characters which do Honour to the present Age, it may not be improper upon this Occasion, to lay before the Reader a true Idea of the present State of MODERN CRITICISM, with some Account of its Parentage and Education.</P>
<P>ILL-NATURE is the Founder of the Family; in a Fit of petulant Delight this Personage was joined in Wed∣lock to the celebrated Dame, IGNORANCE, The Issue of this happy Marriage was ENVY, who, being of a consumptive Habit of Body, and no very amorous Dis∣position, was deterred for a long Time from any Thoughts of Matrimony; but at length meeting with MALICE, he took an immediate Fancy to her, and by a Sympa∣thy of Soul this lovely Pair were led to a mutual Li∣king for each other. MALICE was an old Maid, of a lean shrivelled Habit of Body, and delighted greatly in Tea-table Chat. At first the Relations of ENVY were disgusted at the Match, as they imagined from the La∣dy's Looks, that there was not any probable Likelihood of their having Issue, by which it was apprehended the Family would be totally extinct. But Things are not always to be taken by Appearances; though the new∣married Couple lived together like Cats, constantly scratching and quarrelling, they still found softer Mo∣ments of Dalliance, and in about nine Months, CRITI∣CISM was ushered into the World. The Tidings of this happy Occurrence were soon wafted towards <HI>Grub∣street College;</HI> Mother DULNESS raised her drowsy Head, pleased with the Account of the sprightly Dunce, and all her Votaries hailed the new-born Babe. In <HI>Par∣nassus</HI> the Effect was far different; <HI>Apollo</HI> started, and each amiable MUSE let fall a tender Tear: The tune∣ful Lyre was laid aside, and ASTRAEA dropped her Scales.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="98"/>That the Lineage of this egregious Youth may be carried in the Mind with more Facility, I shall here throw the whole Pedigree in one View before the Eye of the Reader.</P>
<P>ILL-NATURE—IGNORANCE</P>
<P>ENVY—MALICE</P>
<P>CRITICISM.</P>
<P>Like <HI>Richard</HI> the Third, the Infant was born with Teeth, and the Moment it perceived the first Ray of Light, it began to hiss. Several of the usual Play-things given to Children were immediately bought, but no∣thing could allay our young Hero's Cries, until a Cat∣call was given into his Hands, of which, by a Kind of Instinct, he instantly found the Use, and he seemed to take a malicious Pleasure at the Shrilness of the Sound. In process of Time an Horn-book was procured for the young Gentleman, and at the first Sight of it he grew extremely peevish, and shortly after began to pull it to pieces. In this he was encouraged by his <HI>Grand∣mother,</HI> who alledged it would spoil the Child's Eyes, but it is confidently said that he at last took to it of himself, but that he applied at random, in a very irre∣gular Manner; and I am credibly informed, that he could not be induced to pursue the Alphabet in its na∣tural Order, but that the first Letters he became ac∣quainted with, were <HI>D, A, M, N.</HI> It is a Question with many, whether he ever went further; but after some Pains in the Research, I have found from some secret Memoirs, that he really did learn to read the Title-Pages of Books and Pamphlets, in order the more effec∣tually to abuse them.</P>
<P>Our Youth in his Countenance had a blended Re∣semblance to his Parents, with a very great Air of his Grandmother. From his <HI>Grandsire</HI> he derived a Dis∣position to all Kinds of Vice, and therefore the evil
<PB N="88" REF="99"/>Qualities of his Father thrived in a Soil admirably fit∣ted for their Reception. Pleasure he was an utter Stranger to, unless the Misfortunes of his Neighbours excited the mixed Sensations of that malignant Joy mentioned by <HI>Ovid.</HI></P>
<Q>Risus abest, nisi quem visi movere dolores.</Q>
<P>Nothing could ever rouze him to an Emulation of others, whom he perceived to excel, but he sat pining and self-tormented at the Idea of their Merit, and hav∣ing a Volubility of Speech from his Mother, he vent∣ed his Spleen in Obloquy and scandalous Invective. In these Qualities he made great Improvement, and each Day added some new Accomplishment, such as <HI>Impudence, Pertness, Ill-manners,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Being now arrived at Maturity, he grew wondrous fond of Coffee-houses, and turned out a complete <HI>Blood.</HI> He was constantly seen poring over the <HI>Magazines,</HI> and if he ever met with a Production of Genius, he shewed great Perturbation of Mind, and was often heard to pronounce with some Vehemence;—<HI>Pish!—Exe∣crable!—Damnea Stuff!—O G—d!</HI>—He went to the Playhouse on the first Night of every new Piece; the Players dreaded the Sight of him in the Pit; there he talked of Actors whom he never saw; retailed Authors whom he never read; tore up Benches; grinned and chattered; hissed and clapped; yawned and slept. Having heard that <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s Art of Poetry was esteemed among his best Performances, he bought at a Stall a certain curious Production entitled <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s <HI>Master-piece,</HI> which gave him a mean Opinion of the Ancients; and thence he took Occasion to ridicule all Kind of Learning, and became a Delegate, of his own Choice, to direct the Taste of the Age; and if a young Author shewed any Traces of Elegance in a Compo∣sition, or discovered a Vein of Thinking, capable of
<PB N="89" REF="100"/>further Improvements, he endeavoured to nip him in the Bud.</P>
<P>To conclude; CRITICISM has been upon Town for several Years, and still continues in the Practice of every bad Quality, deducible from a weak Head and a corrupt Heart; but as I intend to persevere in the Work I have undertaken, I will cut Matters short, and inform this Gentleman, and all his Followers, that af∣ter this I shall not suffer myself to be diverted from the Drift of this Design. I think I shall be able to of∣fer some Compositions, not quite unworthy of the public Perusal; and if I do not point out any unknown Truths, I shall endeavour to place every Thing in a Point of View, that, I hope, will sometimes give it the Graces of Novelty.</P>
<P>I shall continue to prefix a Motto to each Lucubra∣tion from some celebrated Author of Antiquity, and this not out of any Affectation, but because from an early Taste for those excellent Writers, many of their Beauties have insinuated themselves into my Imagina∣tion, in so lively a Manner, that they recur on almost every Topic. This serves very often with the Classic Scholar, to place an entire Essay before his Eye at once; and to see a fine Passage start into a new Light, and carry a witty Allusion to a Subject, in Appearance foreign to it, must, in my Opinion, excite agreeable Ideas in the Fancy.</P>
<P>The mere <HI>English</HI> Reader will lose this Pleasure, but the rest of this Paper cannot suffer by it.</P>

<SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> HARRY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been in this strange Place about six Weeks, and find myself in such a whimsical Situation, that I may truly say, with <HI>Petulant,</HI> in the <HI>Way of the World, I am like a Dog in a Dancing-School.</HI> Upon our first Arrival here, we took a <HI>Fiacre,</HI> and drove to our Banker, who lives up four Pair of Stairs. As he was our Coun∣tryman, we thought him the most proper Person to direct us, and accordingly enquired whether there were any good Lodgings to be let in the <HI>Rue de</HI>
<PB N="92" REF="103"/><HI>Boncherie;</HI> for you must know, <HI>Harry,</HI> we were in∣formed, before we left <HI>England,</HI> by some Gentlemen, who said they knew <HI>Paris</HI> very well, that we should take up our Residence in that Part of the Town. — But the Banker smiled at the Question, and told us, that the <HI>English</HI> Gentlemen had deserted that famous Street ever since the <HI>Harlequin</HI> at the <HI>Italian</HI> Comedy, in making Love to his Mistress, told her, among other Professions of his Passion, <HI>that he loved her as violently as my Lord</HI> Anglois <HI>did the</HI> Rue de Boucherie. He added, that he would take care to fix us in a proper Lodging, and conducted us to <HI>Peyri Bagneur,</HI> in the <HI>Rue Dauphine,</HI> who accommodated us with a very good Apartment. Our next Care was to equip ourselves in the Fashion of the Country. Ac∣cordingly we sent for a Taylor, and <HI>Jack Commons,</HI> who jabbers a little <HI>French,</HI> directed him to make us two Suits; which he brought us the next Morning at Ten o'Clock, and made compleat <HI>Frenchmen</HI> of us. But for my part, <HI>Harry,</HI> I was so damned uneasy in a full-dressed Coat, with hellish long Skirts, which I had never been used to, that I thought myself as much deprived of my Liberty, as if I had been in the <HI>Bastile;</HI> and I frequently sighed for my little loose Frock, which I look upon as an Emblem of our happy Constitution; for it lays a Man under no uneasy Restraint, but leaves it in his Power to do as he pleases. I must not forget to in∣form you, that we hired a <HI>Swiss</HI> Servant, whom they call here <HI>Valet de Place;</HI> and to him we entrusted the Management of every Thing, which saves us a great deal of Trouble; and I really believe the Fellow to be extremely honest, for I do not find that I spend more Money here than in <HI>London.</HI> As it is absolutely necessary to have a Coach in <HI>Paris,</HI> we engaged a <HI>Remise</HI> during our Stay; and indeed it was indispen∣sably
<PB N="93" REF="104"/>incumbent upon us to set up an Equipage, for we commenced Lords immediately upon entering the <HI>Fauxbourg</HI> St. <HI>Germain.</HI>—Z—ds, <HI>Harry,</HI> these People think, that every Man who looks aukward, and throws away his Money, is an <HI>English</HI> Lord; nay, they are so liberal of this Title, that they call the <HI>English</HI> Taylors and Peruke-makers, who sometimes pay them a Visit, <HI>des petits my Lords.</HI> You may believe, my Friend, I was very desirous to see their Theatrical Entertainments. — I have indeed been at one or other of them every Night. They are d— strange, Sir, — Not the Thing, by any Means. — I do not, it is true, understand the Language, but their Manner is quite different from ours.—The Players seldom or ever throw out the Voice with any Vehemence, but speak in as natural a Manner, as if they were off the Stage — That would not be borne with us. You know, however, the <HI>French</HI> are pleased with it, as they know no better. The first Time I was at the Play-house, I imagined there had been a Riot the Night before; for I observed there were no Benches in the Pit: But, in this I was mistaken, for there never are any Seats in that Part of the House; the Reason is, I suppose, because a <HI>Frenchman</HI> could not sit still during the Performance. With Respect to the Manner of living, <HI>Harry,</HI> it is in∣tolerable. By Heavens! I should have been starved, if I had not luckily got acquainted with an <HI>Irish</HI> Abbe of <HI>Lombard College,</HI> one Mr. <HI>M' Manus,</HI> a very good Sort of a Man, though a Popish Priest. He has a cursed queer Way of talking indeed, his Accent being a Mixture of the Brogue and the <HI>French</HI> Cadence, and his Phrases generally literal Translations from the <HI>French.</HI> He is notwithstanding a d—d honest Fellow, and will get drunk with any of his Friends at a Minute's Warning. If it had not been for this Gen∣tleman, who conducted me to a little Place, kept by
<PB N="94" REF="105"/>one <HI>Kemp,</HI> where I got a Leg of Mutton and Turnips, and Beef-stakes, I should have been obliged to set out Post for <HI>England.</HI> — 'Tis true, upon Honour — My Life was at Stake — I could by no Means live upon their <HI>Soup and Bully,</HI> and footy Kickshaws made of stinking Meat. Their Wines, it must be allowed, are pretty enough, when one is used to them; but at first they seem prodigious weak: They have not half the Body of our Wines in <HI>England:</HI> But, that is easily accounted for, the best Growths being always sent to us; at least <HI>Venables</HI> and <HI>Tomkins</HI> tell me so. In mentioning <HI>Kemp</HI>'s, I should have told you of an ugly Scrape I had like to have fallen into. I got into Company with an Officer of the <HI>Scotch</HI> Troops in the <HI>French</HI> King's Service, and I began to hum him about Party Affairs; but, d—n me, he soon gave me to understand that I was on the wrong Side the Water for that Fun, and insisted, that I should give imme∣diate Satisfaction. Gad, I reflected it would be con∣foundedly silly, to get pinked in a Popish Country, where they would not allow me a Christian Burial; and so I asked his Pardon, and the Affair was made up, by the Mediation of Abbé <HI>M Manus.</HI> This has cured me from attempting any Sport of that Kind while I stay here. You will be surprized, perhaps, that I give you no Account of the People. To tell you the Truth, my Friend, I do not know any of them. I went once to an Ordinary, and the Company were so remarkably civil to me, that I began to think they had a Design upon me; but my Friend, <HI>Jack Com∣mons,</HI> who has studied the Law, and knows these Things, tells me, this excessive Politeness proceeds from their living under an arbitrary Government. I cannot help laughing at the immense Number of <HI>Chevaliers de St. Louis,</HI> which I meet every where. These Gentlemen are as numerous here, as Knights
<PB N="95" REF="106"/>have been in the City of <HI>London,</HI> since the Year Forty∣three. They wear a little enamelled Cross hanging to a red Ribbon, which is fixed in a Button hole of the Coat; and most of them have a Streak of Dirt on their white Silk-Stockings, about an Inch above the Shoe, which, I suppose, is Part of the Order. As to the Government of this Country, I have not thought it worth my while to enquire about it, for I am satisfied with old <HI>England,</HI> and there will end my Days. I have had very few Amours since I left <HI>England,</HI> for I do not know how it is, I am d—d shy of the Women here, they are so devilish sprightly—I know three or four of them, whom my Barber recommended me to, but they are not of the first Class.</P>
<P>To conclude, dear <HI>Harry,</HI> Mr. <HI>M'Manus</HI> has carried me through all the Curiosities in and about <HI>Paris,</HI> and now my Time lies very heavy on my Hands; for as I have no Acquaintance, and am unwilling to enter into any Connexion with People in a strange Country, I am at a Loss what to do with myself in an Evening. The Day I contrive to pass away tolerably, in saunter∣ing in the <HI>Tuilleries</HI> until Dinner, which brings all the <HI>English</HI> together at <HI>Kemp</HI>'s; from thence we adjourn to <HI>Procope</HI>'s, until it is Time to go to the Play, which kills the Time to about half an Hour after Eight; but when the Actors dismiss us, we are perplexed to deter∣mine how we shall dispose of ourselves, and are, in the End, obliged, in our own Defence, to return to <HI>Kemp</HI>'s, and play a Game at Whist. This Way of Life will not do with me, and in about a Fortnight you may ex∣pect to see me, when we will laugh over these strange Scenes at the <HI>Shakespear.</HI></P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Club, of which I am a Member, and of which I have already given some Account in this Paper, is not a Conse∣deracy in Riot and Debauchery, but was instituted with a View of enjoying a pleasing Converse, rather than of contending with each other for the Renown of the most potent Constitution, or the most capacious Swallow. Accordingly our Dis∣course generally turns upon some Topic, that may serve to disclose the Humours of Mankind, or carry our Taste to a greater Degree of Refinement in the polite Arts.</P>
<P>An Evening of this sort I was sure to enjoy at our last Meeting, as the Chair was to be filled by Mr. <HI>Candid,</HI> whom I have formerly described as a very odd Critic, good Nature and Knowledge being Peculiarities re∣markable in his Character. As soon as the mutual Ci∣vilities were exchanged between the Company, this Gentleman acquainted us with an Occurrence, which is really of a very extraordinary Nature. As he was walk∣ing in the <HI>Piazzas</HI> at <HI>Covent-Garden,</HI> he perceived a Man extremely busy in pasting up against the Walls, Advertisements of so singular a Furport, that he was
<PB N="99" REF="110"/>induced to beg one of them, which was read out to the Club, and was in Substance as follows:</P>
<Q><P>Lately launched at <HI>Deptford,</HI> a Ship called the <HI>Pantomime,</HI> now lying at <HI>Iron-gate,</HI> whereof is Owner <HI>John Lun,</HI> Burthen seven hundred Tons, mounts four and thirty Guns, and bound directly for the <HI>South-Seas,</HI> in quest of Monsters of all Sorts; to cruize for some Time in those Parts, and thence to bear away to the unknown World, to touch upon the Coasts of <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> and return home North about, in order to stock our Theatres with the wildest Exotics that can be met with. Good Encouragement will be given to all Seafaring Men, who will ship themselves on board the <HI>Pantomime</HI> above mentioned; and, as a Corps of Marines will be requisite, disappointed For∣tune-Hunters, broken Gamesters, Hen-peck'd Hus∣bands, Under-actors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> shall be received, and en∣ter into Commission forthwith.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> Apply to any of the Brokers on Change, at <HI>Sam</HI>'s Coffee house, <HI>George</HI>'s <HI>Temple-Bar,</HI> the <HI>Bedford,</HI> or the Stage-Door of the Theatre in <HI>Covent-Garden.</HI></P></Q>
<P>This Piece of Intelligence gave no small Astonish∣ment to the rest of the Company; but our Chairman de∣clared, he had seen so many strange Turns in Life, that he did not doubt but it would be absolutely carried into Execution; and added, that it would certainly draw prodigious Houses, to have it mentioned in the Play-Bills, that the principal Parts, in a new Entertainment, will be performed by a wonderful <HI>Armadillo</HI> from <HI>Brasil,</HI> a <HI>Serpent</HI> from the River <HI>Oronoque,</HI> the famous <HI>Lanthorn-Fly</HI> from <HI>Peru,</HI> a <HI>Mermaid</HI> from the <HI>Ladrones Islands,</HI> a surprising <HI>Camel,</HI> a <HI>Rhinoceros,</HI> and many horrible Ani∣mals, <HI>being their first Appearance on the English Stage.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Candid</HI> proceeded to observe, that <HI>poor Shakespear,</HI> who used to flourish, like the Thorn at <HI>Glastonbury,</HI> in
<PB N="100" REF="111"/>the Depth of Winter, must now entirely be destroyed but however, to prevent, as far as in him lay, this threat∣ning Mischief, he informed us, that he has drawn up, with no small Pains, a Pamphlet entitled, <HI>A modest Pro∣posal against abolishing Nature, and</HI> Shakespear, <HI>at this Juncture,</HI> addressed to <HI>David Garrick,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> with whom he hoped it would have due Weight, as all his Perfor∣mances have displayed a true Relish for our great Poet's masterly Touches, and as the Course of his Manage∣ment has proved him to be a cordial Friend to Genius and Letters.</P>
<P>"And now, since I have mentioned Mr. <HI>Garrick,</HI>" continued he, <Q>I had rather see him come out from the Murder of <HI>Duncan</HI> in the Character of <HI>Macbeth,</HI> with the Daggers in his Hands, than behold a Fountain of Tin, playing in Jetteaus, a real Cascade, or a Coun∣try-dance by all the Monsters of the Creation.—I may be out in my Taste, but, there are Touches of Nature in the Play just mentioned, which I shall always reflect upon with Pleasure; though I cannot help wondering, that <HI>Garrick,</HI> who always strikes out the brightest Ideas, should attach himself to the com∣mon Reading of a Line in the Part of <HI>Macbeth,</HI> when so noble a Meaning is to be extracted from the same Passage. The Thing, I mean, is, when he looks at his Hands, and breaks out into the following Speech.
<Q><L>With all great <HI>Neptune</HI>'s Ocean wash this Blood</L>
<L>Clean from my Hand? No;—this my Hand will rather</L>
<L>The multitudinous Sea incarnadine,</L>
<L>Making the Green one Red.</L></Q>
The last Line is generally pronounced, as if <HI>Shakespear</HI> meant, the GREEN-ONE, which, after the pompous Expression of the <HI>Multitudinous Sea,</HI> would render it liable to the Imputation of an Anticlimax; whereas,
<PB N="101" REF="112"/>if it is understood, as <HI>making the Green,</HI>—ONE RED, i. e. the Colour of the Sea, which is of itself green, <HI>one intire universal Red,</HI> it would close the Passage with a Dignity responsive to what precedes, and ade∣quate to the Vastness of <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s Conception, as it not only keeps up the Image impressed upon the Mind, by the Term MULTITUDINOUS Sea, but also height∣ens the Horror of <HI>Macbeth</HI>'s Crime; the Blood he has spilt being sufficient to convert the natural Colour of the whole Ocean into—ONE RED.</Q></P>
<P>This Interpretation may, perhaps, not appear <HI>Ortho∣dox</HI> to those who are bigotted to <HI>Play-house Tradition;</HI> but by our whole Club it was thought extremely just, and Mr. <HI>Plastick,</HI> the <HI>Shaftsburian</HI> Philosopher, received it with an Air of Enthusiasm; declaring, that it sug∣gested an Idea, which expanded the Imagination, the more it dwelt upon it. After this, he offered some Doubts, which arose in his Mind, concerning a Passage in the same Play, of which he conceived the Meaning, though he did not see the Propriety and Consistence of the Figures. The Lines hinted at are in <HI>Macbeth</HI>'s Soliloquy concerning the Deed he was to perpetrate.
<Q><L>— I have no Spur</L>
<L>To prick the Sides of my Intent, but only</L>
<L>Vaulting Ambition, which o'er-leaps itself,</L>
<L>And falls on th' other.—</L></Q> Mr. <HI>Candid</HI> immediately reassumed the Discourse. <Q>The first Thing to be observed, said he, is the Rapidity of <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s Imagination, and the quick Succes∣sion of Ideas, which it supplied him with. The me∣taphorical Expression in the Verse,—<HI>I have no Spur to prick the Sides of my Intent,</HI>—gave Occasion to the Figure following, in the succeeding Line—<HI>But</HI>
<PB N="102" REF="113"/>VAULTING AMBITION, <HI>which o'er-leaps itself, and falls on th' other.</HI>—The Allusion is to a <HI>managed Horse,</HI> and AMBITION is represented as a Person, who en∣deavouring to vault into the Seat, by the Violence of his Effort, overleaps himself, and falls quite on the other Side.</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Shaftsburian</HI> returned Thanks for the Light thrown upon this Place, and observed, that the Inter∣pretation is perfectly applicable to the Circumstances and Conduct of <HI>Macbeth;</HI> when Mr. <HI>Allcash,</HI> the Ci∣tizen, interposed, and told us, that, for his Part, he did not mind your Plays much,—that he went to see <HI>Garrick</HI> at <HI>Goodman</HI>'s-<HI>Fields,</HI> and could not help laughing to see the People cry at <HI>King Lear,</HI> when he knew it was all a Play, and paid his Money for it. This con∣tributed to ruffle the Temper of Mr. <HI>Plastick,</HI> who in∣stantly harangued upon the <HI>Public Sense,</HI> the <HI>Moral Sense,</HI> and the <HI>Internal Sense;</HI> but Mr. <HI>Allcash</HI> was not to be beat out of his Way, and, instead of paying any Deference to this Doctrine, he desired an Explanation of a Line in <HI>Othello,</HI> where <HI>Iago</HI> says, <HI>Who steals my Purse steals 'Trash, 'tis something, nothing.</HI> <Q>Is there not, <HI>said he,</HI> some Mistake, in calling Money <HI>Trash,</HI> and <HI>something nothing?</HI></Q></P>
<P>The Chairman smiled at this Observation, which he promised to consider at his Leisure, and for the present, proceeded to give a Correction of a Mistake in <HI>Othello,</HI> in the fifth Act of which <HI>Iago</HI> says to <HI>Roderigo,</HI>
<Q><L>I have rubb'd this <HI>Gnat</HI> almost to the Sense,</L>
<L>And he grows angry.</L></Q> The common Editions give us the Lines in this Man∣ner, and Mr. <HI>Warburton</HI> has done the same. <HI>Theobald</HI> is the only Editor who saw the Absurdity. <HI>To rub a</HI>
<PB N="103" REF="114"/><HI>Gnat,</HI> as he observes, though ever so gently, would rub it out of all Sense, and would effectually kill it. Yet, though he perceived the Error, it seems, he knew not how to mend it. The Quarto Editions, Mr. <HI>Candid,</HI> told us, instead of <HI>Gnat,</HI> read <HI>Quat,</HI> or <HI>Quot;</HI> <Q>but <HI>Theobald,</HI> continued he, not knowing the Meaning of the Word, alters it to <HI>Knot,</HI> the Name of a Bird, and has a long Note to justify the Correction. But the old Books are perfectly right, a <HI>Quat,</HI> or <HI>Quot,</HI> being a small Heat or Pimple, which, by itching, provokes us to scratch it, and when rubbed to the Quick or Sense, it becomes hot and angry. The Word has not perhaps the Authority of any contem∣porary Writer, but must certainly be <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s, as it is still used in <HI>Warwickshire,</HI> the native Country of the old Bard; and in <HI>Northamptonshire,</HI> where I passed a good many Months, a few Years since, it still carries with it the Meaning already assigned to it.</Q></P>
<P>Our Chairman ceased here, and I apprehend, that the communicating this Remark will be agreeable to all the Admirers of <HI>Shakespear;</HI> and I am apt to think, that many Passages of the Poet, seemingly corrupted, are to be illustrated, not from Books, but from the Cus∣toms and Dialect of the People; many of the Terms, which appear quite antiquated and obsolete, being, as I am informed, still used in the Northern Parts of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>Our Researches into Literature ended here, and the Company immediately withdrew, like satisfied Guests. If my Readers should rise from the Perusal of this Lu∣cubration with the same Relish, I shall have gained the End proposed by this Account of our Transactions.</P>

<P>YOU will undoubtedly be informed by the public Papers, long before this can reach your Hands, of the Conversion of that excellent Actress, Mrs. <HI>Wof∣fington,</HI> who is at present highly admired here for her admirable Performances. Various are the Conjectures concerning the Motives, which induced her to renounce the Errors of the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> but the most pro∣bable Opinion is, that some eminent Lawyers advised her to this Step, in order to qualify herself to wear a Sword in the Characters of Sir <HI>Harry Wildair</HI> and <HI>Lo∣thario;</HI> which she could not safely attempt as a Papist, it being highly penal in this Kingdom for any one of the <HI>Romish</HI> Communion to carry Arms.</P>

<Q>—Dabiturque Licentia sumpta pudenter.
<BIBL><HI>HOR.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>Y Lucubration of last <HI>Saturday</HI> contained an Account of the Transactions of our Club; and as an Incident offered, after it broke up, which gave Rise to the Speculation of this Day, I beg that this Paper may be received as a Sequel to it.</P>
<P>The Majority of our worthy Members returned home, rather sooner than is usual with them; at length, Mr. <HI>Candid</HI> and myself were the only Two remaining. As we drew nearer to the Fire, and to each other, our Hearts began to throw off all Reserve; and the <HI>Conver∣sation,</HI> which before was vague and upon general To∣picks of Literature, became gradually more confined, and at length it centered wholly on ourselves. Mr. <HI>Candid,</HI> amongst other Particulars, began to congratu∣late with me on my Address and Reputation as a Writer, and the Credit he was pleased to say I had acquired, in conducting the Paper which bears my Name. Your Reputation, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> says he, is at present in its early Bloom; the Aspect of the Public shines on you, with a cheering Influence and Warmth. But you are not to imagine, it will be always thus. The Sky may be overcast, and the enlivening Radiance intercepted; a chilling Frost may unexpectedly succeed, and nip all your Blossoms in the Bud. To drop the Metaphor,
<PB N="106" REF="117"/>continued he, the Countenance and Encouragement of the Public may be withdrawn, and at a Time when you are exerting all your Talents to deserve and secure it. Popular Favour, and popular Prejudice, are the most capricious Things imaginable. Disgust will often arise, where no Satiety has been given; and mutual Confi∣dence and good Liking will unaccountably degenerate to Coldness, Suspicion, and Indifference. Yet, it may be difficult to say, from whence this Alteration is occa∣sioned; or, whether it is owing to the Pretensions of the Writer, or the Reader; but in this Case perhaps, as in most others, there may be Faults on both Sides. Exorbitant Claims are not so easily adjusted; especially where the Parties are equally unwilling to recede from their presumptive Rights. The Author is often un∣reasonable in his Demands for Fame; and the Public as hard to be gratified in their Expectation of Pleasure. You are, at present, considered as a new Writer; the Delicacies you regale the Town with, are a Dish un∣thought of by your Fellow-Caterers for the general En∣tertainment. But these in Time will become familiar to our Taste; your Wit will then be censured to have lost its Poignancy, and your Humour its Relish. I was going to make a suitable Reply to so obliging an En∣comium, when my Friend prevented me, by observing that the Evening was now far advanced; and that it became us, as <HI>Originals,</HI> not to prolong our Compota∣tions to the modern Midnight Hours of Conversation.</P>
<P>In retiring to my Chambers, I could not forbear ru∣minating on the Sentiments of my penetrating Ac∣quaintance; and resolved to throw together a few Re∣flections upon what may be term'd <HI>Novelty</HI> in Writing.</P>
<P>I think then that judicious Imitation either of antient or modern Standards ought not to be stigmatised as Larceny in an Author. He is certainly at Liberty to
<PB N="107" REF="118"/>draw from any excellent Model, whom he chuses to copy; and that without incurring the ignominious Ap∣pellations of a Plagiary or Transcriber. Universal Cus∣tom will justify the Practice. All the imitative Arts may be more particularly termed so, as the several Masters have frequently work'd after a Plan, that was first sketched out by some eminent Example. The same Design, diversified indeed with newer Decorations, as Genius or Invention prompted, may be traced in the different Performances of subsequent Artists; sometimes extended by the Addition of Circumstances, which na∣turally grew out of the Work; or contracted, by pruning the luxuriant Branches, and retrenching what appeared superfluous and unnecessary.</P>
<P>This general and distant Imitation, it will be readily owned, is allowable and just; is what cannot perhaps be easily avoided, where the Subject is treated with Propriety, and according to the Rules of Art. Thus <HI>Virgil</HI> followed <HI>Homer;</HI> thus <HI>Addison</HI> will always be re∣garded as the Pattern either of grave, or of humourous Speculation; and <HI>Fielding</HI> will ever be a faithful Guide to the Adventurer in comic Romance.</P>
<P>But there is another Kind of Imitation, which is more direct and literal; and which consists in adopting the Sentiments and Phrase of others. Of this the Le∣gality is yet a Question, and the Practice is generally judged to denote Poverty of Thought, and Defect of Imagination in the Writer. The Censure is perhaps too rigid, or at least may be moderated by some qua∣lifying Considerations that suggest themselves to our im∣partial Attention.</P>
<P>The Transfusion of Wit, from one Language to another, when done with Elegance and Ease, has been seldom turned to the Disparagement of the Author who has Abilities to do it, when the Spirit is not suffered
<PB N="108" REF="119"/>to evaporate, but retains all the Sprightliness and Vigour which it possess'd in the Original. The Sentence which I have placed at the Head of this Paper is an Indul∣gence to an Author, either for reviving obsolete and antiquated Expressions, or for the Importation of new ones, if the Liberty be used with Modesty and Discre∣tion. What <HI>Horace</HI> has thus observed with regard to Words only, may be Parity of Reason be applied to Sentiment and Thought.</P>
<P>If the Language is enriched by the Addition of a single Term or Phrase, our Stock of Knowledge is made still more exuberant, by introducing a Succession of new Ideas; in Proportion as the Value of an Ingot is superior to a single Coin. To discover a new uncom∣mon Vein of Thinking upon ordinary and beaten To∣pics, requires that creative Power of Imagination, which Nature has imparted only to her Favourites, and with a frugal sparing Hand. Authors of inferior Genius have easier Methods assigned them in their Pursuit of Fame. It must be their Merit to select the most agreeable and pleasing Imagery, to give delicate and graceful Turns to obvious and common Thoughts; and by this Means to recommend what is grown familiar to our Ima∣gination, by the Novelty and Advantage of its Dress. A Statue which we have ceased to look on with the Eyes of Admiration, when removed to another Point of View, shall strike us with fresh Pleasure and Delight; a Pleasure which results entirely from the Novelty and Change of its Position.</P>
<P>There is a Couplet in <HI>Pope,</HI> which I beg Leave to produce, as applicable to the Sentiments advanced.
<Q><L>True Wit is Nature to Advantage dress'd,</L>
<L>What oft was thought, but ne'er so well express'd.</L></Q>
<PB N="109" REF="120"/>And this very Sentiment, which I mention only as re∣lative to the Subject, and which, on any other Occa∣sion, I should have industriously concealed, our inge∣nious Poet has taken from a Remark of <HI>Boileau.</HI> Wri∣ters who argue with Precision will often unavoidably fall into a Coincidence of Thought: Nature and Truth are invariable; and when several Pictures are taken of the same Object, if they are just Copies of the Original, they will necessarily have a Likeness to each other. I might add likewise, how difficult it is to offer what has not yet been said by any one, on Subjects that appear exhausted.</P>
<P>An humourous Acquaintance, who often talks to me on this head, lays it down as an indisputable Principle, that Composition is only the Art of Stealing wisely: And indeed, as Matters are usually managed by our worthy Fraternity of Authors, if we strike out the last Word, his Definition is perfectly unexceptionable. I make then no Scruple to declare, that I look on all the Wit, and all the Humour in antient or modern Languages, as good and lawful Prize; and that I shall freely convert them to my own Use, and the Public Emolument: But then I will take care to do it in such a Manner as shall reflect no Disgrace to the Author from whom I borrow it; and that, if he comes at any Time either in Person, or by his Attorney, to demand his Property, he shall find it employed in the very Way which he himself would chuse.</P>
<P>Having said this, I give public Notice of this my In∣tention to Mr. <HI>Town</HI> and all his Adherents, and I ad∣vise them withal to keep a good Look-out, in order to detect and expose me.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>INCE my first entering upon the Province of a periodical Writer, I have been very inquisitive concerning myself, and, while I have been endeavouring to glean Cha∣racters and other Materials for the Embellishment of my Paper, I have made it my Business to collect all the Intelligence I could in relation to Mr. <HI>Ranger.</HI> With this View, I have spent Two-pence in every Coffee house within the Bills of Mortality, and I have some Time past stood listening to the Buzz of Fame around me; as the Lion is said, when he has fill'd the Forest with Terror, to stop short in his Career, in order to observe the Effects of that Alarm, which his Roaring has occasioned among the Tenants of the Wood. Some, I find, are pleased that a Satyrist is stalking abroad; others afraid of coming under his Lash; and different Reports prevail in different Quarters. In one Part of the Town I am a black Man, in another a fair one; now tall, now short; now fat, now lean; <HI>English, Scotch,</HI> and <HI>Irish</HI> by Turns. At <HI>Sam</HI>'s Coffee∣house, in the City, I have a Place in the Custom-house; at <HI>Batson</HI>'s I am a Physician without Practice. From thence my Consequence grows less by Degrees, and dwindles all along <HI>Cheapside</HI> and <HI>Fleetstreet;</HI> insomuch that my Spirits would subside to a very low Ebb, did not my Fame again start up at the Coffee-houses about
<PB N="112" REF="123"/>the <HI>Temple,</HI> where I am represented in various Lights; and no later than Yesterday, I over-heard a sober∣looking Man saying to his Friend, <Q>I am not fond of giving any Body an ill Word, but I believe he is an Attorney.</Q> From <HI>Temple-Bar</HI> Westward my Reputation gathers Strength and Lustre, and by the Time it reaches the <HI>Bedford,</HI> <Q>I am a damned fine Fellow, that have seen a great deal of the World, KILLED my Man, debauched my Girl, intrigued with a Countess, cuckolded an Alderman, and an ex∣cellent Bottle-Companion; a Wit, a Blood, a Mimic, and what not?</Q> Were I a Dupe to Popularity, I should certainly derive a very exquisite Pleasure from these various Descriptions, as I flatter myself that a Person must have some Degree of Importance, before he can thus become the Topic of public Conversation. There is another Circumstance which does not a little administer to my Pleasure; and that is the Variety of unknown Correspondents, from whom I am frequently honoured with Epistles in this my public Capacity. Some of these Gentlemen are so obliging as to pay their Compliments to my <HI>excellent Talents;</HI> but all such Tokens of Civility, I beg Leave to suppress; nor shall I take this Opportunity to write in Terms of Adulation, under an imagined Character to myself; though I know it is the Practice of many Brother Authors, and though I am not insensible of the delectable Sounds, <Q>Dear <HI>Ranger,</HI> your Predecessor the <HI>Tatler, &amp;c.</HI></Q> or <Q>your Brother Essayist Mr. <HI>Addison, &amp;c.</HI></Q> or, <Q>the Subli∣mity of your Genius, the Delicacy of your Wit, the irresistible Poignancy of your Humour, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>— Eternal Admirer and constant Reader.</Q> Something in this Stile would, I must own, play agreeably about the Heartstrings, and give a Lustre to my Reputation; but I shall at present have the Self-denial to resist this

<P>In handling this Argument, Mr. <HI>President,</HI> I shall beg Leave to set out with what may seem not very apposite to the Purpose, but it will lead into many Reflections, which will appear not wholly foreign to the Point. King <HI>James</HI> I. was the worst Monarch that ever sat in the Throne of these Realms; he was a pedantick, grammatical, pragmatical, tyran∣nical King, and his Son <HI>Charles</HI> was deservedly brought to the Block by that great Man <HI>Oliver Cromwell.</HI> The Seeds of Popery were sown in all the <HI>Stuart</HI> Race; the Jesuits know this perfectly well, and if there is one here at present, let him rise and contradict me if he can.</P>

<P>Read the Question, Sir, <STAGE>(Question read)</STAGE> I canno conceive why the Member who spoke last, should go oot of his Way to abuse the Hoose of <HI>Stuart,</HI> but I shall no follow him through all the Puddle and Mire it would lead me, were I incleened to pursue him — Touching this Question, Sir, there are three Things to be considered; the first is the Theory of Vision; Secondly, the Motion of the Sun and planetary
<PB N="119" REF="130"/>System; Thirdly, the Operations of the human Mind, with our Ideas simple, complex, abstract and concrete—With Regard, Sir, to the first, <HI>Barclay</HI> has the best Accoont, and every one knows, that the Sun was struck out of Chaos by the creative Mandate of the Almeety Fiat; and sinally it is certain, that Memory depends on our earliest Associations of Ideas, which naturally evinces Deism, and utterly discoontenances the Cause of Christianity, which <HI>certainly is not foonded on Argu∣ment.</HI> Mr. <HI>Locke,</HI> in his Chapter of innate Ideas —</P>

But, hem! — I must observe, Mr. <HI>President,</HI> that the Objections to Revelation arise from an Ignorance of the original Language, in which it was <HI>commocnicated.</HI> For Instance, the Passage relating to <HI>Jeptha</HI>'s Vow has been a great Fund of Raillery; but when we take the full Force of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Passage, <HI>Eama, Jacabasa, Irraurista, Diarba, Diota,</HI> I apprehend the Difficulty disappears. I am glad to have this <HI>Oppor∣toonity</HI> of correcting this Mistake, which Gentlemen have gone into in opposing Revelation to <HI>natooral</HI> Religion.
<PB N="120" REF="131"/>The Light of the Scriptures, Mr. <HI>President,</HI> leads to the Improvement of <HI>natooral</HI> Religion, and like the Ra∣diance of the Sun, <HI>hoomanely</HI> speaking, does pervade all Bodies that are not impervious.</P>

<P>The Affirmatives in this Question has endeavoured to invalidate the Gospel Exhibition; but as one Gentleman has observed, many Mistakes arises from the Ignorance of the <HI>Hebrew;</HI> and to be sure, we does he under that Disadvantage, which is however in some Sort re∣moved by the Notes in <HI>Stackhouse</HI>'s Bible. There is a Writer, <HI>Mounseer</HI> DU PIN, who, though of the <HI>Romish</HI> Communion, may be allowed sometimes to speak Truth, though his Arguments often militates against himself, and I does upon the whole apprehend, that Revelation, or the Gospel Exhibition, like that glorious Luminary the Sun, is of Divine Original.

<BIBL>FRESNOY's <HI>Art of Painting.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">P</SEG>OETRY and Painting have been ac∣counted Sister-Arts by Men of Taste in all Ages, and accordingly we find them both, in the Writings of all good Criticks, from <HI>Aristotle</HI> and <HI>Horace,</HI> down to <HI>Dryden</HI> and the <HI>Abbé du Bos,</HI> mutually borrowing Side-lights, and reflecting Lustre upon each other. They justly have the Pre∣cedence among the Arts of Imitation and Design, as they convey their Ideas by Signs more fixed and de∣terminate than any of the others, and boast a more un∣bounded Scope to cull and select from all Nature, in order to adorn and embellish the favourite Piece.</P>
<P>I am aware that it may be said, Statuary has very near the same Advantage; and, that the Artist in this Way may observe the Knitting of a Joint in one, the Turn of a Neck in another, the Form of the Head in a Third, the Shape and Rounding of a Limb in a Fourth; and that, in short, from a Survey of sundry Objects, a complete and perfect Whole may be executed. But it must be remembered, at the same Time, that Statuary has not so ample a Field to range in, as the two first-mentioned, and is therefore greatly inferior to both.</P>
<P>Painting, in one particular Instance, seems to gain the Ascendant over Poetry, being universally under∣stood
<PB N="131" REF="142"/>in every Clime and every Age, whereas the latter is confined to much narrower Limits, both in Time and Place. A <HI>Raphael</HI> painted, and a <HI>Vida</HI> wrote at the same Period; and how confined is the Reputation of the latter, when compared to the extensive Renown which has attended the Name of the first, through every Age and Country? The Aera may arrive, when, through the Instability of the <HI>English</HI> Language, the Stile of <HI>Joseph Andrews</HI> and <HI>Tom Jones</HI> shall be obli∣terated, when the Characters shall be unintelligible, and the Humour lose its Relish; but the many Person∣ages, which the Manners-painting Hand of <HI>Hogarth</HI> has called forth into mimic Life, will not fade so soon, from the Canvass; and that admirable <HI>Picturesque Comedy,</HI> the <HI>March to Finchley,</HI> will perhaps divert Posterity as long as the <HI>Foundling-Hospital</HI> shall do honour to the <HI>Bri∣tish</HI> Nation. A Picture speaks the Language of every Nation, and is universally felt and understood in many different Countries at the same Time, in this Instance partaking the Advantages of MUSICK, which is how∣ever subject to many Restrictions, to which the Art of Painting is entirely a Stranger. The Caprice and Whim of different Nations prevent the Power of Harmony from becoming so universal in its Influence; for the pri∣mary Beauty of it, consisting in an Imitation of the Sounds appropriated to our several Passions, and those Sounds varying according to the Habits and Dialect of every different People, it follows of Course, that the Musick of any one Country must undergo many Changes and Variations, before it can be adapted to the Ear of a Man, who has resided for any Time in another Kingdom.</P>
<P>This Inconvenience the Art of Painting is not sub∣ject to, and in this Respect has the Advantage over Poetry, though in almost every other Point, it is obliged
<PB N="132" REF="143"/>to yield the Pre-eminence. It has been long since ob∣served, that Truth is agreeable to the Understanding, and fine Imagery to the Fancy; but neither of them, we find, affords so intense a Pleasure, as when the Passions are agitated and worked into a Ferment. We then attach ourselves strongly to the Object, which ex∣cites these Emotions; we are pleased to be wakened from a State of still Life; and it is a Gratification to our moral Sense, to find our Hearts sensible and alive to those Sensations, which are the Ornament of our Nature. This being the Case, I believe, it may be as∣serted without incurring the Danger of a Controversy, that Poetry boasts this Power over the Passions beyond any other Art, at the same Time that it is a Vehicle for Instruction, and derives much of its Beauty from the Scenes of picturesque Imagination. Painting indeed partakes sufficiently of these Qualities, to entitle her to the Name of Sister, has many Features like, and in the Execution of her Designs is mostly directed by the same Rules. Both must have Unity of Action and Unity of Character, and both have a Latitude to in∣troduce subordinate Personages, concerned in the main Business, and to exhibit them in proper Attitudes. A Metaphor may be as bold in Painting as in Poetry; an Allegory may be as instructive and pleasing to the Fancy upon Canvass, as in the written Page; what the Critics call Machinery, may be displayed in as elegant Strockes with the Pencil as with the Pen; the Fairy-way of Writing, mentioned by <HI>Dryden,</HI> may be made Use of in Colours, and the Fancy of the Artist, like a new Creation, may start to the Eye an whole Race of ima∣ginary Beings. Some of the finest Passages in Epic and Dramatic Poesy, are those, where a Conflict is marked between several warring Passions; Painting throws these immediately before the Eye, and in Tints
<PB N="133" REF="144"/>artfully blended, the nice Assemblage is delineated in the most striking Manner. A further Instance of the Congruity between these two Arts, is, that when a Poet has been lavish in a Description, the best Method of examining the Justness of it is, to consider what Kind of Figure it would make upon Canvass; and on the other Hand, the Descriptions, which we find in the Poets, may serve to supply Hints and Instruction to the Painter of Taste and Poetick Imagination. Add to this, that, as the chief Beauty of Poetick Diction does not consist in a Profusion of Ornaments, high Meta∣phors, and a Flourish of Words, so in the other, Co∣lours too rich and glowing are disapproved, and the Excellence of both Arts, is seen in regular Designs, and a just Imitation of Nature.</P>
<P>The Ancients were enthusiastick Admirers of all the imitative Arts, particularly Painting, and upon all Oc∣casions, we find them expressing a Taste for the Pro∣ductions of the famous Artists. Accordingly their Poets seize every Opportunity of describing a Picture, a Piece of Sculpture, or any of the Works of the Loom. <HI>Ovid</HI> never omits it, where it naturally grows out of his Subject, and <HI>Virgil</HI> never seems more delighted than when he is laying before our Eyes the Shield of <HI>Aeneas,</HI> or, like a skilful Virtuoso, pointing out to our Observation, the Beauties of a fine Painting:
<Q><L>Artificumque manus inter se operumque laborem</L>
<L>Miratur—</L></Q></P>
<P>The Pleasure in this Case is <HI>redoubled</HI> upon the Mind, springing from a twofold Source; for the Delight we take in all poetick Description, is chiefly owing to the natural Love we have for Imitation, which affords an
<PB N="134" REF="145"/>Opportunity of comparing the Transcript with the ori∣ginal Object; and, when we peruse the Description of a Picture, we admire not only the Poet's Representation of it, but the Talent of the Artist, who has thus con∣trived to delineate by his Pencil so exact a Resemblance of Things, which have their Existence in Nature; and thus the Mind has two Arts to examine at once, and dwells between them both in a Suspense of Pleasure.</P>
<P>I have always admired the Description in the first <HI>Aeneid</HI> of that exquisite Piece of Painting of the Wars at <HI>Troy;</HI> and I think, the Poet's Account of it may sug∣gest to us some Notion of the sublime Ideas he enter∣tained of the Sister-Art of Poetry. All the Figures, which he mentions, are bold and animated; every Thing is in Motion, and, if I may be allowed to apply a Line of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s,
<Q>All Matter quick and bursting into Life.</Q>
What an Image have we of the <HI>Trojans</HI> repelling the Enemy, and of <HI>Achilles,</HI> with his nodding Plume, thun∣dering at their Heels in his Turn? You think you hear the Sounding of his Carr, and you imagine you see him with his Arm aloft in Act to strike.</P>
<Q><L>Hac fugerent Danai, premeret Trojana juventus;</L>
<L><HI>Hac Phryges,</HI> INSTARET CURRU CRISTATUS ACHILLES.</L></Q>
<P>The Situation of <HI>Troilus</HI> has been often admired, and the Procession of the <HI>Trojan</HI> Nymphs will always ex∣cite the tenderest Sentiments, and, I dare affirm, a finer Groupe was never imagined. Their de∣jected Looks, their dishevelled Hair, and the beating of their Breasts, are all striking Circumstances.</P>
<Q><PB N="135" REF="146"/>
<L>Interea ad Templum non aequae Palladis ibant</L>
<L>Crinibus Iliades passis, peplumque ferebant</L>
<L>Suppliciter tristes, &amp; tunsae Pectora Palmis.</L></Q>
<P><HI>Priam</HI> raising his unnerved Arms, and imploring the Body of his Son <HI>Hector</HI> from <HI>Achilles,</HI> who dragged the Corps thrice round the Walls of <HI>Troy,</HI> must also afford great Room for the Expression of several Passions all at once struggling in the Soul; and upon the whole, I persuade myself, that if such a Painting as this Great Poet has here described were handed down to us, it would be the most valuable Piece of all Antiquity.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">P</SEG>ROMPTED by the Esteem I have for your entertaining and instructive Writings, I venture to convey my Sentiments to you in Relation to some Miscarriages in Life, which proceed rather from Ignorance and the want of Education, than any natural Propensity to Evil; and I am the more induced to this, as my own Life will afford ample Room for Reflection.</P>
<P>Without any further Detail, you must know then, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> that I am the Son of a Tradesman in the West of <HI>England,</HI> long since deceased; the Lowness of my Father's Circumstances would but barely suffice for the Maintenance of a numerous Family, and you will therefore suggest to yourself, that my Education could not be better than what is afforded in the Generality of Country-Village Schools. In vain did my Father sol∣licit the Assistance of a rich Relation of his at <HI>Bristol;</HI> in vain did he represent the promising Genius of his Son, if put under proper Culture. Deaf to the Ties of Af∣finity, though possessed of an Estate of fifteen hundred <HI>per Annum,</HI> and a large personal Fortune, without the Charge of a Family, and any Likelihood of having
<PB N="138" REF="149"/>any, he would afford him no Assistance; and I was therefore obliged, after having gleaned up all I could in the short Time I was at School, to seek a Service with a neighbouring Farmer. With him I lived several Years driving Plough, and employed in other Sort of Husbandry, when News arrived of the Death of the Relation I mentioned, and of his having left me all his real Estate, with six Thousand Pounds in Money, and three Thousand Pounds to each of my four Sisters. When I tell you that from my Education, and the Nature of my Servitude, I contracted a very strong Byass to low Company, you will imagine, I must make but a very indifferent Figure in my new Station. I was then two and twenty, and had never been accustomed to any Kind of Intemperance; and if my former Situation had enabled me to have been reckoned Company for the Gentlemen of the Place, I might still have continued a sober Man; but unhappily for me, the Circumstance of my having been a Servant, made me, notwithstand∣ing the Largeness of my Fortune, shunned and despised, and I was constrained to herd with my former Com∣panions, and others of better Substance, but abandoned Morals, with whom I soon acquired an Habit of Idle∣ness and Debauchery, by which, in a few Years, I found my ready Money exhausted. To gratify the Extrava∣gance of my Passions, which were now become violent and unruly, I was advised to take up some Money upon Part of my Estate, and to this Purpose I applied to a neighbouring Lawyer, who soon procured it for me. As the Meanness of my Education had hindered me from knowing any Thing of Law Affairs, I got my two Companions to overlook the Mortgage Deed, and with their Advice signed it, and they also set their Hands as Witnesses.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="150"/>Being now in Possession of seven Thousand Pounds, I was advised by these my two Friends to see the World, as they called it, and accordingly I set out soon after with them for <HI>London,</HI> leaving the aforesaid Lawyer to receive all my Rents in the Country. You will na∣turally imagine, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> that in Town I tasted all the Pleasures it could give me; I saw every Thing, but still in the worst Company, and was con∣tinually surrounded by a Set of Sharpers, till having squandered away all my Money, and got considerably in Debt, I was arrested and sent to the <HI>Fleet.</HI> In this Situation I directed my Lawyer to remit me some Money, and the Arrest gave me no Concern, as I made no Doubt of being quickly at Liberty; but judge, Sir, my Surprize, when I was informed, that the Lawyer was in Possession of my whole Estate, by an absolute Surrender from me, which I had through Ignorance signed instead of a Mortgage deed, and that my two Friends, who had left me just before I was arrested, ap∣peared for the Attorney to witness the whole Trans∣action. The Bitterness of this Calamity, and the Con∣sciousness of a mispent Life, filled me with the severest Grief, and would have entirely extinguished the Use of what little Reason I had, but for the Charity of a Fellow-Prisoner, who, touched with a Sense of my Mis∣fortunes, not only did every Thing to alleviate them, but infused such a Portion of Knowledge and Philosophy into my Mind, during our long Imprisonment, as must for ever render me sensible of his Kindness. Let me finish the Account of my Life, when I have told you, that I was freed from my Imprisonment by the last Act of Grace, and that, with a moderate Sustenance, pro∣cured by honest Industry, I find myself more happy and contented now, than when possessed of Affluence, and a Mind immersed in Ignorance and Folly.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="151"/>As my Sisters received no better Education than my∣self, I should tell you, that notwithstanding their For∣tune, they are all come to Infamy and Poverty. The Eldest, soon after our Relation's Death, married a La∣bourer to the Farmer she had lived with in the Station of Maid Servant, and they have run through all they had. The second was debauched by the Son of the Gentleman, at whose House she had hired herself, and is now in one of the Houses of bad Fame in <HI>Covent-Garden;</HI> the third married a Footman, and died about two Years ago, after having lived in great Distress; and the fourth, with Shame I speak it, is now Mistress to the Earl of******.</P>
<P>From this Account of myself and my Family, I shall only draw one Inference, that if the Relation, who left us so liberally at his Death, had but given us a good Education, and behaved to us in his Life-time agreeably to the Estate he intended to leave us, the Misfortune we have met with, might, in all human Probability, have been avoided; and being connected by Marriage, or otherways, with Families of Credit and Reputation, we might now remain in Affluence, and enjoy a Name unsullied by Vice and Infamy. I am,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The preceding Story is told by my Correspondent, in so interesting a Manner, that I could not with∣hold it from the Publick this Day, and I not only agree with him in his Remark, that his Misfortunes would all have been prevented by a proper Education, but I will add, that a Mind, which supported itself so well
<PB N="141" REF="152"/>under Affliction, and that can look back to former Scenes of Life with so much Sensibility, would have imbibed such Impressions from an early Improvement, as might have rendered him an Ornament to any Family. If many of those, who find any striking Incidents in the Series of their Lives, would thus communicate them to the Public, it would be a very great Service to Society, as it would serve to detect the Ways of the World, and might put the Unwary upon their Guard against ill-designing Men. There is something extremely affecting in the Ruin of my Correspondent's four Sisters, but I am, however, highly pleased that he now enjoys a Tranquillity of Mind, and that, to alleviate Calamity, his Resources are in Virtue and honest Industry. I must observe, that the Inattention of the old Gentleman, who died at <HI>Bristol,</HI> to the Manners and Morals of his Relations, shewed something in him highly illiberal, not to give it a worse Epithet; and it is owing to this Indifference to the Improvement of the rising Genera∣tion, that we frequently see Estates in the Hands of those who are a Disgrace to Riches; and while this con∣tinues to be the Case, it is not to be wondered, that we meet with so many Boobies of Fashion, inelegant in their Behaviour, loose in their Morals, and fit to ride behind the Equipage, in which their Pride now lolls at Ease.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Laurel, which has been so much sought by the Writers of every Age, is not unlike the Golden Branch mentioned in the sixth <HI>Aeneid;</HI> if a Man is born to share the Prize, it is easily obtained; but if there be not derived from Heaven a Superiority of Genius, fruitless is the Endeavour of the unborn Poet, who thinks to arrive at the Heights of Fame by painful Vigils and the Dint of Labour and Application. A Medio∣crity in Poetry will never be allowed: <HI>Horace</HI> tells us that the Suffrages of both Gods and Men are against it, and that a Writer of this Cast must never expect to see his Name on the Bookseller's Rubrick-Post. Poetry requires warm and glowing Colours; the Language of it must be elevated above the Diction of Prose; the Expressions should be more animated, and the Imagi∣nation of the Reader more immediately struck at, than in any other kind of Writing; and whoever has not
<PB N="144" REF="155"/>Energy of Genius to cultivate these Qualities, will be always sure to be neglected as a cold and spiritless Author.</P>
<P>Of all the different Species of Poetry, the Dramatic is the most difficult to succeed in, and, as it is expressed in the Words of my Motto, those few only, whom Heaven has peculiarly favoured with an Elevation of Mind, have been able to acquit themselves with Ho∣nour. Our much admired <HI>Shakespear</HI> stands yet un∣rivalled; he seized the Laurel with a Master-Hand at one Grasp; <HI>Johnson,</HI> by slower Degrees, though eager in Pursuit; <HI>avidusque refringit cunctantem;</HI> and <HI>Otway</HI> seems to have gained it with Facility.</P>
<P>I am pleased to find, that an Author justly celebrated among the foremost Successors of these immortal Ge∣nius's, has added another Wreath to that Garland, which the Muses long since wove for him; and, in my Opi∣nion, the Public is greatly indebted to him for his <HI>new Tragedy</HI> of the <HI>Brothers,</HI> which was lately acted for the first Time at <HI>Drury-Lane.</HI> At the same Time that I advance this, I must observe, that the Subject of it is not perhaps as interesting to a <HI>British</HI> Audience, as a more domestick Story; and the Generality of People not being acquainted with the History of that Monarchy, it thence results that the Distress of the King of <HI>Macedon</HI> does not engage our Passions so forcibly as might be ex∣pected. It may be added, that the <HI>Macedonians</HI> are sup∣posed, at that Point of Time, to be at Variance with the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, for which we have contracted a kind of reverential Esteem; and on this Account those sublime Sentiments, which <HI>Philip</HI> utters in the Scene with the Ambassadors, against that Republick, are not received with a sufficient Degree of Warmth. But if it be consi∣dered, that the <HI>Macedonian</HI> Monarchy, though it dwindled by insensible Degrees, and was at last swallowed up
<PB N="145" REF="156"/>by the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, was at one Time the most flourishing in <HI>Europe,</HI> I apprehend no Man can be entirely unconcerned in the Fall of so brave a People. I do not doubt but the Mention of <HI>Cressi</HI> and <HI>Poitiers</HI> would have a more powerful Influence on the Passions of <HI>Englishmen,</HI> than <HI>Thrasymene</HI> and <HI>Cannae;</HI> but for my Part, my Breast glowed to hear of those memorable Bat∣tles, which had like to have been so fatal to the <HI>Roman</HI> Republick; nor do I remember a grander Sentiment than that of <HI>Philip,</HI> when the Flight of <HI>Hannibal</HI> at <HI>Capua</HI> is urged by the Embassy of <HI>Rome.</HI> His Answer is, <HI>Ay, there indeed I was not with him.</HI> The Scene which suc∣ceeds this, is full of as tender Emotions as I have ever felt in any Theatre; the Anguish of the Father, to find a Discord subsisting between his Children, and the Re∣monstrance with which he endeavours to sooth them, must soften the Mind of every Hearer.</P>
<Q><L>Why do I sigh? Do ye not know, my Sons?</L>
<L>And if you do, Oh! let me sigh no more!</L>
<L>Let these white Hairs put in a Claim to Peace.</L></Q>
<P>Perhaps no Characters can be better marked than those of <HI>Philip, Perseus,</HI> and <HI>Demetrius;</HI> for the two last of which we are finely prepared by the following Lines.*</P>
<Q><L>— They both are bright; but one</L>
<L>Benignly bright, as Stars to Mariners;</L>
<L>And one a Comet with malignant Blaze</L>
<L>Denouncing Ruin.</L></Q>
<P>The Art of most Writers for the Stage is to exhibit one Character, and that perhaps without any distin∣guishing Qualities to separate it from other Heroes; but in this Play we are entertained with three of a different
<PB N="146" REF="157"/>Cast, and each strongly marked. <HI>Philip</HI> is distinguished by a Warmth of Temper, an Haughtiness of Soul, and a Tenderness for his Children, that runs over in the most affecting Manner. <HI>Perseus</HI> is a different Villain from any we have seen on the Stage; Policy and Bra∣very are so blended in him, that we see their mixed Ef∣fects in every Scene; and <HI>Demetrius</HI> is of so amiable a Disposition, that an Audience must be naturally in∣clined to love him, and for his Sake to dread the restless turbulent Spirit of <HI>Perseus,</HI> whose Contempt of <HI>De∣metrius</HI> vents itself in a sneering artful Strain.</P>
<Q><L>You that admire the <HI>Romans,</HI> break the Bridge</L>
<L>With <HI>Cocles,</HI> or with <HI>Curtius</HI> leap the Gulph:</L>
<L>And league not with the Vices of our Foes.</L>
<L>I hear, Sir, you take Wing and mount in Metre;</L>
<L><HI>Terence</HI> has own'd your Aid; <HI>Terence</HI> there the Slave</L></Q>
<P>The Invocation, which is uttered by the same Per∣sonage, is carried on in a masterly Manner, filling the Mind with a Train of awful Ideas, and rising in a Climax of Horror to the last Line.</P>
<Q><L>Hear, from thy Ebon Throne, profoundest Night,</L>
<L>Thou and thy gloomy Daughters all, that smile</L>
<L>On Deeds of Horror, and on Frauds of Hell;</L>
<L>That keep the Door of black Conspiracy,</L>
<L>And snuff the grateful Scent of human Blood;</L>
<L>From <HI>Acheron</HI>'s sulphureous Banks arise,</L>
<L>And bursting through the Barriers of this World,</L>
<L>Stand in dread Contrast to the Golden Sun,</L>
<L>And spread around your pestilential Blasts,</L>
<L>That wither every Virtue in the Bud;</L>
<L>While I transport ye, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q>
<P><PB N="147" REF="158"/>
It will be unnecessary to remind my Readers of the Trial-Scene, which must inevitably fire the intelligent Mind with a classic Warmth. I cannot help thinking that the Author, in this Passage, has given a just Idea of the two different Kinds of Eloquence, which pre∣vailed in <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Perseus</HI> enters immediately into the Matter; his Sentences are strong and nervous; and, sure of con∣vincing the Understanding by the Clearness of his Diction, he does not condescend to address the Imagi∣nation. It is true, he at one Time sheds Tears, but that is only to obviate the Power of Eloquence, which he is aware might be used by his Brother, who ha∣ving imbibed the Art of <HI>Roman</HI> Oratory, sets out in the most insinuating Manner; tries the Avenues to the Passions, and endeavours to win his Hearers by Persuasion. I am sensible that this Beauty may escape the Multitude, but, even without this secondary Plea∣sure, the Scene cannot sail of striking every Imagi∣nation.</P>

<P>WE can assure the Public, that the following is a true Copy of the famous Petition, which was so much talked of, while the Marriage-Bill was depending.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The humble Petition of the Gamesters, Sharpers, Fortune-Hunters,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>in and about</HI> London,</HEAD>
<OPENER>Sheweth,</OPENER>
<P>THAT your Petitioners make no inconsiderable Number of his Majesty's Subjects; and under∣standing, that there is at present a Bill under the Con∣sideration of your Honourable House, the Intent of which is, to prevent clandestine Marriages, we presume to remonstrate, that if the said Bill should pass into a Law, it must inevitably be attended with the most de∣structive Consequences to your Petitioners. A <HI>British</HI> House of Commons cannot be ignorant, that Gaming, to which your Petitioners have been bred, is an Intro∣duction
<PB N="149" REF="160"/>into all the polite Families, within the Cities in <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Westminster,</HI> by which easy Means of Ac∣cess, many worthy Gentlemen, distinguished by the Appeliation of <HI>Chevaliers de l'Industrie,</HI> have frequently been able privately to convey an Heiress, either to <HI>May-Fair</HI> or the <HI>Fleet,</HI> and thereby acquire an ample Fortune. Now your Petitioners humbly apprehend, that they shall be precluded this Advantage, by the bill now depending in your Honourable House; for should it be necessary, to render a Marriage valid, that a Licence must be granted in the Presence of the Parties Parents, or next Relations, it is much to be feared, that a Citizen of <HI>London,</HI> ignorant of the gay World, may not pay a due Regard to the Distinctions of a laced Coat, and smart-cocked Hat; whereby your Petitioners will be under an absolute Necessity of obtaining the Consent of such a Wordling, who will probably, from a Narrowness of thinking, acquired by pecuniary Trans∣actions, imagine, that we are not entitled to a Fortune, because we have none of our own. Now we beg Leave to suggest, that, should we be deprived of this valuable Branch of our Profession, Necessity, which supersedes all Law, may compel us to go on the Highway; the Effects of which may be so fatal to the good People of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> that undoubtedly an <HI>English</HI> Parlia∣ment will exert their utmost Wisdom to prevent them. We therefore hope, for these Reasons, that the Bill will be rejected.—</P>

<PB N="151" REF="162"/>shot himself through the Head. The Noise alarmed the Family who instantly went up Stairs, and found him dead. I shall write to you more at large very shortly, and must beg Leave, for the present, without adding any Thing farther, to subscribe myself,</P>

<SIGNED>Yours with great Sincerity, *****</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>The gloomy Month of <HI>November</HI> being passed, I ima∣gined that the horrid Crime of Suicide would cease, at least till the Return of that heavy Time of the Year. It is certainly a poor Desertion from the Dignity of our Nature, to suffer the Pressure of the Atmosphere, or any other sublunary Incident, to make such an Impres∣sion upon our Spirits, as to render us avowed Enemies to ourselves. I have heard a popular Insurrection called, an unnatural Rebellion; but by what Name shall we stigmatize an Action, which flies in the Face of our Maker, which dares to thwart the Dispensations of the supreme Being, and say to eternal Providence, who from the first ordained all Things for the best,
<Q>"NOT THINE, BUT MY WILL BE DONE?"</Q></P>
<P>It requires no Profusion of Imagery, no bold daring Metaphor, no studied Hyperbole to represent this Piece of Impiety in its proper Colours; it strikes the Eye at once in its most flagrant atrocious Dye, and were it sufficiently attended to, it would teach a due Resigna∣tion to the Determinations of Heaven, and would pre∣vent all that Train of Evils, from which any thinking Mind must now start back appalled.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="163"/>If Self-Preservation is the nearest Principle to the Heart of Man, what a Perversion of our Faculties, of our Reason, and our Judgment, must usurp the Mind of him, who thus runs counter to the very End of his Creation! The Dignity of the human Soul is extin∣guished; not only his Power of Reflexion is suppressed, but his very Passions are thrown off their Byass; they are seduced from their original Institution; their Nature, Use, and End is perverted; and what before sought real or apparent Pleasure, and avoided actual or ima∣ginary Pain, now by a strange Fatality seeks its own Destruction. Anarchy and Civil War disturb the Ima∣gination, and the Man bears his own secret Enemy in his Breast; he forms a Design upon his own Life; he has the Air drawn Dagger constantly before his Eyes, and he at length becomes his <HI>own Macheth.</HI> Not even the bloody Purposer of determined Vengeance on ano∣ther's Head (horrid as the Crime appears) is half so astonishing; because he does not carry with him half the Absurdity. The latter has Time left him to atone by Penitence for his Barbarity, whereas the Suicide urges precipitantly to the Tribunal of his offended God.</P>
<P>The real Source of this fatal Evil is perhaps hard to be ascertained; but if it is not originally an Emana∣tion from Pride, it is tinged with it so strongly, that there is Reason to conclude, it is frequently derived from thence. Self Love will always induce us to over∣rate our Rank in the Scale of Beings, and when once the Imagination is struck with the Idea of fancied Im∣portance, each little Trial of Adversity is considered as a Grievance intolerable; it is too much for the Man to bear; he concludes himself a destined Mark for Af∣fliction, and, rather than drag a feverish Life under an
<PB N="153" REF="164"/>huge Load of Misery, he proudly resolves to put an End to his Sufferings, and measure out the Thread of his own Existence.</P>
<P>For my own Part, I cannot look upon any Con∣tingence in this World of Consequence sufficient to urge a Man to this Extreme of Madness. Is he reduced to Want by his inordinate Expences, or do the Narrow∣ness of Circumstances prevent him from emerging into that Station of Life, which his Ambition would aspire to?—Let him but examine the Happiness of the Affluent; how many want with a full Purse, how many are tortured with Diseases, or eaten up with uneasy Pas∣sions? Have a Man's Relations unworthily withdrawn their Protection from him? there are Occupations enough, in which he may endeavour to support him∣self, without their Assistance; and then he will have the Satisfaction of living independent of those who have deserted him; and should he fail, his honest Indi∣gence will at all Times be a Disgrace to them; so that either Way he will be a living Affront to his false Friends.</P>
<P>In so polite an Age it may not be proper to corro∣borate what has been advanced, by Arguments drawn from Religion; but if an Heathen may have any Weight in the Affair, I would inform the Man of De∣spair, that <HI>Plato</HI> and <HI>Cicero</HI> were both of Opinion, that we are placed in this World, as Soldiers upon Duty, and that no one has a Right to move without the Sum∣mons of his commanding Officer; and <HI>Virgil</HI> in the Words of my Motto tells us, that there is a Place of Retribution for those unhappy Wretches, who dare to lay violent Hands upon themselves, and, prodigal of Life, to precipitate their Souls into Eternity. They would be glad, continues the Poet, to bear Poverty and the sharpest Miseries, could they again return to
<PB N="154" REF="165"/>Life; but the Fates forbid them, and their Passage is irremeable.</P>
<P>To these Authorities, I would beg Leave to add the Sentiment of our great <HI>Shakespear,</HI> who, though he may be justly suspected of Christianity, was still a Poet, and therefore may be cited on this Occasion. He has introduced a young Prince, deliberating, whether he should not extricate himself from the Troubles of this World, by boldly putting an End to his Residence on this Side of the Grave. The Point is argued with great Strength of Reasoning; the Calamities of this Life are thrown into the Scale, and after stating every Thing in the most striking Colours, a Prospect of Futurity opens to the Imagination, and the Mind starts back from the desperate Act, convinced that it is our Duty to en∣dure Life, and bear our Portion with Fortitude, until Heaven shall be pleased to put in Execution that Sen∣tence of Death, which it has passed on all Mankind.</P>
<Q><L>Who wou'd Fardels bear,</L>
<L>To sweat and groan under a weary Life,</L>
<L>But that the Dread of something after Death,</L>
<L>That undiscover'd Country, from whose Bourne</L>
<L>No Traveller returns, puzzles the Will,</L>
<L>And makes us rather bear those Ills we have,</L>
<L>Than to fly to others that we know not of?</L></Q>

<P>FROM a Motive of Gratitude, and for the Benefit of my Countrymen in general, I beg Leave, thro' the Channel of your Paper, to communicate the Disor∣der I have been for some Time afflicted with, and the
<PB N="155" REF="166"/>traordinary Cure I lately met with. I have had for many Months successively a flow nervous Fever, with a constant Flutter on my Spirits, attended with pertina∣cious Watchings, Twitchings of the Nerves, and other grievous Symptoms, which reduced me to a mere Sha∣dow. At length a Friend, who had himself expe∣rienced it, advised me to have Recourse to the reading of the <HI>Inspector</HI>'s Papers. I accordingly took one of them over Night, and the Consequence was, I fell into a profound Sleep, which lasted near six and thirty Hours. Since that I have been ordered, for fear of a Lethargy, to take them in smaller Quantities. A Paragraph at a Time now answers my Purpose, and, under Heaven, I owe my sleeping Faculties to the above-mentioned <HI>In∣spector.</HI> I look upon them to be a grand <HI>Soporificum mirabile,</HI> proper to be had in all Families. He makes great Allowance to those who buy 'em to sell again, or send abroad to the Plantations. The above Fact I am ready to attest, when called upon.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> WENT, one Morning last Week to pay a Visit to a Lady, for whom I have always had a very great Respect. An Excursion which she made, into the Country, was the Occasion of my not having seen her for some Time, but upon the first Notice of her being in Town, I imme∣diately did myself the Favour of waiting on her. It was with great Satisfaction, that I perceived her Com∣plexion florid to the highest Degree of Health. As I knew she had two Sons at <HI>Eton</HI> School, I enquired after the young Gentlemen, and received for Answer, that the Brats were minding their Books. <Q>Boys, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> (said she) are best when out of one's Way — they make such a Noise in an House, that there is really no such Thing as bearing with them — I hope they are going on well — But, Sir, you don't know all my Family.</Q> Upon this she rung the Bell, and ordered the Servant to bring down Miss <HI>Lucy</HI> and Miss <HI>Charlotte,</HI> and then continued Mrs. <HI>Bizarre,</HI> <Q>they are both quite jealous of one another; Miss <HI>Lucy</HI> has taken a Notion into her Head that <HI>Charlotte</HI> is my Favourite, and <HI>Charlotte</HI> equally suspects my Pro∣pensity to <HI>Lucy,</HI> — but upon my Word, it is without Foundation; I give them no Manner of Reason, — well, now I think it would be quite wrong in me to make any Difference, when they are both deserving;— I vow and protest, I love them both alike — I can't think how some Folks can be so—to be sure it's
<PB N="157" REF="168"/>very commonly the Cause of great Uneasiness in a Family, and the little Things are unhappy in their Minds — Lard, I wonder what keeps them above so long</Q> — When on a sudden the Parlour Door was thrown open, and as I did not recollect that Mrs. <HI>Bizarre</HI> had any Daughters, I advanced with some Degree of Impatience to salute the young Ladies; but to my great Surprize, the Maid introduced to me two very ugly Monkeys, dressed out in the nicest Manner with <HI>Paris</HI> Caps, and well chosen Petonlair and Petti∣coat.</P>
<P>The Disappointment I met with flung me into some Confusion, and I retired back in a very aukward Man∣ner to my Chair. <Q>There, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> (reassumed the Lady) this is Miss <HI>Lucy</HI> and this is Miss <HI>Charlotte</HI> — Pray, Sir, don't you think they have very pretty turned Faces — there's a Family Likeness between them, I think — they are the only Comfort I have — Pray, <HI>Molly,</HI> did Miss <HI>Lucy,</HI> take the Manna as the Doctor ordered, — Lord, I was frighted out of my Wits Yesterday, the poor thing was so terribly pained with the Cholic — and Miss <HI>Charlotte</HI> has been coughing all the Morning; I hope it won't fall upon her Lungs; — they are the sweetest Creatures in the World — Where's your Curtsey, Miss, when a Gentleman speaks to you? — She is absolutely, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> the greatest Prude in <HI>London</HI> — She quarrels with the Maid, if she but leaves her Breast the least uncovered; and you know, the Fashion is now to shew as low as one possibly can— and her Sister there, Miss <HI>Charlotte,</HI> she is the violentest Coquet in Nature — <HI>Molly,</HI> give that Fan — See how she handles it — Soft Affectation plays about her twisted Neck, as it's in the Play — don't you think she has fine Eyes? — Well, did you ever see such a pretty little Mouth;
<PB N="158" REF="169"/>and the finest Teeth — I am afraid she is a little in∣clined to be sat — She'll never be taller — Lard, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> I wish I could get her a Husband; I should be glad to see her well settled — he, he, he.— Now, I have a queer Notion in my Head — Do you know that I have a Husband in my Eye for her? — Guess who it is</Q> — To this I took Occasion to answer, that there are really so many pretty Gentlemen about Town, that it would be absolutely impossible for me to form a right Conjecture, and I therefore begged she would be so kind as to inform me. <Q>Why, Sir, (re∣plied she) there is <HI>Tom Titmouse,</HI> that is always biting his Lips, and never has a Bit of his Shoe seen above his Buckle; and <HI>Billy Wirewig,</HI> who always stinks of Perfume; or <HI>Jemmy Doll,</HI> with the delicate Com∣plexion, and the little mincing Step; but it is not any of them — O fie, the Frights! — do you think I would accept of any of 'em — I assure you, Sir, I refused a much better Offer — I could have had Captain <HI>Jessamy</HI> of the Guards, but I have a finer Thought in my Head now — Was you ever at <HI>Mo∣ther Midnight</HI>'s? — To be sure you was, he, he, he, — Well, for certain, I am a comical Woman — You remember the pretty dear Creature, that sits at Supper on the right Hand — he, he, he, it came into my Mind the Moment I saw the dear Fellow, that it would be a good Match; and so now, as I don't know where to send, I have drawn up an Advertisement which I intend to put into the Papers — here, you may read it, Sir.</Q></P>
<P>This I complied with; it was in Substance as follows:</P>
<P><Q>If the Monkey, that sat on the right Hand at <HI>Mother Midnight</HI>'s, and drank a Glass of Wine, after bowing to the Company, has no Aversion to Matri∣mony;
<PB N="159" REF="170"/>he is desired to call at <HI>May-Fair</HI> Chapel, and he will hear of something to his Advantage.</Q></P>
<P>Upon Perusal of this extraordinary Advertisement, I endeavoured to expostulate with the good Lady, on the Oddity of her Proceeding, and I remonstrated, that it would appear to the World the most whimsical Thing that was ever practised. Irritated at this, Mrs. <HI>Bizarre</HI> could not bear to be touched in so tender a Point, and she told me with some Vehemence, that Monkeys have often more Sense than many of the human Species; and I believe the Dispute would have rose high between us, had not an Accident put an End to it.</P>
<P>While we were engaged in Conversation, a Quarrel happened between the two young Ladies, and in a Mo∣ment Miss <HI>Lucy</HI> tore off Miss <HI>Charlotte</HI>'s Cap; which Compliment was returned in Kind, and then the Bat∣tle was carried on with great Eargerness on both Sides, attended with violent Screamings, with bouncing about the Room, leaping on Chairs and Tables, and flying violently in our Faces. All the Ornaments on the Mantle-piece were broke to Shatters; the China Figures, which before seem'd to breathe and think, came trem∣bling down. <HI>Woodward</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Clive,</HI> who represented in exquisite <HI>Chelsea-Ware,</HI> their different Characters in <HI>Lethe,</HI> shared the general Wreck; Mrs. <HI>Bizarre</HI>'s Face was scratched in several Places, and she also lost in the Fray a very elegant Pair of <HI>Dresden</HI> Rustles.</P>
<P>Prudence directed me to escape from this strange Scene with the utmost Expedition, and as soon as I found myself in my Chambers, I could not help reflect∣ing on the whimsical Turn of Mind, which disposed this Lady to fix her Heart on such a disagreeable Race of Animals. When a Woman becomes an Apostate from the Laws of Nature, and divests herself of the pro∣per
<PB N="160" REF="171"/>Ornaments of her Sex, she is as great an Exotick as any in her Collection of wild Beasts. I believe, the Pangs of Jealousy would be much keener in an Husband's Breast, were he to find himself rivalled by a Monkey; and for such a Set of odious Creatures to see a Person neglect her own Children, is so fantastical a Circumstance, that some of my Readers may perhaps think the Existence of such a Character improbable; but I can assure them, that there are frequent Instances of it in this Town.</P>
<P>To regulate and govern the Imagination, is recom∣mended by a <HI>Greek</HI> Philosopher, as a Point of Moment in the Conduct of Life; and most assuredly the Rule is excellent. The Imagination is the liveliest Faculty of the Soul, and gives to all Objects the Hue and Colour, which they seemingly wear; and we love and hate, hope and fear, according to the Scenes which are pictured to our Fancy. It is this which makes <HI>Quixotilla</HI> call aloud for a Cork; and under a due Government is the Source of that sprightly Taste and just Sense of Things, which is remarkable in <HI>An∣gelica;</HI> it is this which gives new Graces to her Beauty, irradiates her whole Countenance, and in all Scenes and Circumstances of Life renders her the most amia∣ble of her Sex.</P>
<P>To cultivate, therefore, and cherish the natural Af∣fections, to direct them to worthy Objects, to keep them all in Harmony, so that not one of them shall grow out of due Proportion, or contract any whimsical Habit, is the best Preserver and Beautifier of the female Form, it gives that pleasing Turn of Mind which we call Sweet∣ness of Temper, prevents Wrinkles, Distortion of the Features, and gives an agreeable Air to the whole Person, as a few of the Sex have experienced; and as such it is this Day recommended to all the female Readers of this Paper.</P>

I have already put out a Gentleman's Eye, dislocated three of another's Teeth, and broke my Foil upon the small Ribs of a Third; and, if I proceed in this Manner, I begin to be apprehensive about the Consequences which may arise from unforeseen Acci∣dents, and therefore I am now determined to entrench myself from Insults within one of the Resolutions, which
<PB N="164" REF="175"/>I entered into upon the Commencement of this Paper, <HI>viz.</HI> not to deserve Ill of any Man.</P>
<P>It would be well if all the Individuals of Society would enter into a reciprocal Agreement of observing the same Principle in their Deportment we might then see that Harmony subsist, which as sociable Beings it is our Bu∣siness to promote; this would banish all surly Morose∣ness; and in short, this single Rule, of deserving I'l from no Man, would prevent all Indecorums and Ani∣mosities, and substitute in their Room mutual Consi∣dence and Good-breeding.</P>
<P>But the contrary occurs every Day, and seems to be derived from no other Source than a vicious Gratifi∣cation of our private Humours. A selfish Spirit is condemned in Ethics as the Cause of many Vices, and it is of no less evil Influence in the <HI>Petites Morales,</HI> or <HI>lesser Morals.</HI> When a narrow Regard to a Man's own Sensations gains the Ascendant, and none will recede from their equal Right of having their own Way, it is not to be wondered, that ill Humours should sour the Temper, and that frequent Quarrels should arise.</P>
<P><HI>Philipsus</HI> has taken it into his Head, that to be brisk and shining in Conversation is the most elegant Accom∣plishment he can aspire to, and therefore has spent most of his Time in the Acquirement of something, that he calls Wit; but in the Eyes of Men of Sense, is only a petulant Pertness very annoying to his Com∣pany. <HI>Philipsus</HI> has laid it down as a Maxim, that he must upon all Occasions display his favourite Talent, and would rather at any Time lose his Friend than his Joke. <HI>Antiphaus</HI> is an absolute Enemy to all Preten∣sions to be shining; Conversation with him, must be in a plain sensible Manner; he will neither give nor take a Joke; hence these two are constantly at Vari∣ance,
<PB N="165" REF="176"/>and it is imagined by their Friends, that the Affair must be at last decided behind <HI>Montague-House</HI></P>
<P>For my Part, I have often wondered how Men can be such Enemies to their Pleasures, as to be thus obsti∣nately bent on the Indulgence of their own private Whim∣sies, without abating any Thing from their Pretensions, in order to contribute to the Felicity of their Neighbours. The social Passions afford more real Delight, than any selfish Gratifications; the latter are sure to Occasion a Nar∣rowness of Spirit, while the former expand the Faculties of the Mind, and receive Addition from being com∣municated, like the Sun painting the Hemisphere with Streaks of Light, which serve to adorn his Way, and augment the Glory of his Career. In a State of mu∣tual Dependance, which Nature has allotted to us all, it is not to be imagined that any one will pay the least Deference to our Ease and Happiness, unless in our Turn we recede a little from our own Humours and purchase by our Deportment that Complacence, which every one desires to meet with in his Intercourse with Society.</P>
<P>But as this Restraint upon our Conduct seems to be too much thrown off, it is not to be wondered that fre∣quent Recourse is had to Duelling, to decide Diffe∣rences between those, who have renounced the Gui∣dance of Reason; which would surely forbid us to squander away the Life — bestowed upon us by the supreme Being, upon such trivial Incidents, as for the most Part occasion these Extremities. The <HI>Romans</HI> knew nothing of this modern Practice, which is entirely of <HI>French</HI> Growth, and, like many of the Fashions of that Country, should be exploded from all civilized Nations. It may not be improper to cite the Definition of Courage from so fine a Gentleman
<PB N="166" REF="177"/>as Mr. <HI>Addison.</HI> In his elegant Poem, entitled the <HI>Campaign,</HI> he tells us,
<Q><L>True Courage dwells not in a troubled Flood</L>
<L>Of mounting Spirits and fermenting Blood;</L>
<L>Lodg'd in the Soul, by Virtue over-rul'd,</L>
<L>Insiam'd by Reason, and by Reason ccol'd.</L></Q> I never yet heard of an Affair between two Gentle∣men, according to the polite Phrase, but one or both of them was egregiously in the Wrong; and, I persuade myself, that if, indead of determining wilfully to sup∣port Matters of no Moment, People could be brought to canvass their Differences with some Degree of Tem∣per and Chearfulness, we should not often have Advices from <HI>Morybone Fields,</HI> or any of the usual Scenes of Action upon these Occasions. To evince this, I shall conclude with the following Story. I was once in Company at a Tavern with a Set of Gentlemen, when after much Mirth and Festivity, one of the Party, who had been silent almost the whole Night, accosted a Gentleman who had contributed greatly to our Enter∣tainment by a lively Vein of Fancy peculiar to him, in the following Words. <Q>Sir, (says he) taking him by the Button. I have something to communicate to you — I have observed, Sir, — that you have been very facetious all Night, — you have run your Rig upon me, Sir, and so — I desire you will meet me To-morrow Morning in <HI>Pancras</HI> Burying-Ground.</Q> — A Blood of the Town would perhaps have been fired at this Proposal; but my Friend received it with great Composure, and while the rest of the Company were struck dumb at the Solemnity of the Challenge, he turns to him with a Mixture of Jest and Earnest in his Countenance, and whispers <Q>in <HI>Pancras</HI> Burying Ground, Sir?</Q> <Q>Yes, Sir, in <HI>Pancras</HI> Bury∣ing
<PB N="167" REF="178"/>Ground without fail</Q>—Very well, Sir,— <Q>must I bring my Shroud with me?</Q></P>
<P>The Pleasantry of this Question excited a general Laugh in the Room, and the solemn Gentleman could not resist the Impulse of Mirth; he joined in the Cho∣rus, and, as soon as he recovered from his Fit of Merri∣ment, exclaimed, "You're a brave Boy — give us your Hand.—I'll never meet you, but on a Party of Plea∣sure, and to that you may command me whenever you please."</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG> Lively Imagination is, if I may use <HI>Shake∣spear</HI>'s Expression, great Nature's second Course; for not content to have enjoyed the intellectual Pleasures immediately ari∣sing from the Beauty of external Objects, or the tran∣sient Scenes of Life, it frequently, when they have vanished and disappeared, makes fond Excursions after them again; and even in our Sleep, it will occasionally recall the Objects of our waking Reflection, and from thence receive livelier Sensations, than were perhaps occasioned by the first Impression. Though there are many fantastic Circumstances in these Night Thoughts, if I may be so allowed to call our Dreams, yet, on these Occasions, we sometimes find ourselves presented with agreeable Visions, and, amidst the wildest Vagaries of Fancy, we can often trace something like just Reasoning, and a real Picture of Life. As I take this to have been the Case with me a few Nights since, I shall make no Apology, for throwing my Dream upon Paper this Day.</P>
<P>I found myself on a sudden, near a large intricate Wood, which I had the Curiosity to enter. A whim∣sical band of Hope and Fear, Joy and Grief, Pain and Pleasure hovered over our Heads. Tender An∣guish, soft Desire, pleasing Agony were all inter∣mixed, and in their motley Livery formed a many∣coloured
<PB N="170" REF="181"/>Groupe. <HI>Cupid</HI> made violent Work with his Darts and Flames, and nothing was to be heard but tinkling Rills, falling Fountains, and love-sick Sighs, by which the Aspen Leaves were perpetually kept in a rustling Tremor. The God of Love had by him a prodigious Quantity of Arrows, differently feathered, according to the various Effects, of which they were to be productive. This Circumstance called to my Mind a beautiful Passage in a Poem by Doctor <HI>Parnell.</HI></P>
<Q><L>And ev'ry Dart can boast a Kind,</L>
<L>Which suits each proper Turn of Mind.</L>
<L>From the tow'ring <HI>Eagle's</HI> Plume</L>
<L>The <HI>generous Hearts</HI> accept their Doom.</L>
<L>Shot by the <HI>Peacock</HI>'s painted Eye</L>
<L>The vain and <HI>airy Lovers</HI> die.</L>
<L>For <HI>careful</HI> Dames and <HI>frugal</HI> Men</L>
<L>The Shafts are speckled by the <HI>Hen.</HI></L>
<L>The <HI>Pyes</HI> and <HI>Parrots</HI> deck the Darts,</L>
<L>When <HI>Prattling</HI> wins the panting Hearts.</L>
<L>When from the <HI>Voice</HI> the Passions spring,</L>
<L>The warbling <HI>Finch</HI> affords a Wing:</L>
<L>Together, by the Sparrow stung,</L>
<L>Down fall the <HI>Wanton</HI> and the <HI>Young;</HI></L>
<L>And fledg'd by <HI>Geese</HI> the Weapons fly,</L>
<L>When others love they know not why.</L></Q>
<P>It was not unpleasant to observe the Variety of Im∣pressions that were occasioned in both Sexes by this strange Flight of Arrows. Men I perceived in close pursuit of blooming Virgins, merely from the impulse of Vanity; and I saw several Nymphs running, with the utmost Precipitation, from their Lovers; though by their Manner of looking back, and the rustling they made in the Trees, there was room for Conjecture that they did not desire entirely to escape.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="182"/>Pleasing as the Sensations of Love are, I could ob∣serve that very unhappy Effects were often the Conse∣quences. Many there were, whose Mien spoke a De∣jection of Spirits, and they were frequently driven to such Extremes, that they laid violent Hands on their own Lives. As I travelled on, I saw several hanging on Bows of Trees; and on the Waters, which were swelled with Tears, and ruffled with Sighs, floated many a pallid <HI>Corpse;</HI> in their Countenances I could plainly see the Traces of that sickly Luxury of Thought, which is so apt to settle into a fixed Despair.</P>
<P>From this Scene of Distress, I turned away as soon as possible; and was relieved from my Uneasiness, by the Sight of a few, who seemed to be happy in their Passion; whose Hearts felt a mutual Warmth, and whose Eyes were brightened into Gladness. They walked Arm in Arm down the flow'ry Meads, inter∣changing mutual Glances of Affection; though ever and anon succeeded Anger, Suspicion, open War, and Peace again. In the Center of the Wood, stood a Temple sacred to VIRTUE, where all, who were de∣sirous of leading a Life of Happiness, were directed to bend their Course, in Order there to be united to∣gether in Bands of chaste Affection. I was sorry to find that some of the Ladies had not Resolution to per∣severe in this Path: Whether it was owing to loose De∣sires or seducing Temptation, I cannot decide; certain it is, they tired in their Journey, and stepped aside with their Paramours to sequestred Bowers; from whence they were afterwards discarded into the thorny Parts of the Wood, for the Remainder of their Days; but even of these, a few there were, who after their Digression, still found Means to be introduced into the Temple; whither they were however pursued by an old Hag, called SCANDAL, who never yet has been known to let them entirely efface the Remembrance of their Error.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="183"/>The Ladies, who kept on a due Course, never failed to lead the Men in Captivity after them to the Temple, from whence, after a short Ceremony, they were dis∣missed in Pairs, to commence the Road for Life. Three different Paths were open to their Choice, and a Guide stood at each Entrance to receive them. The first was of a cold dispassionate Temper, who took every Thing alike, and his Name was INDIFFERENCE. The second had Eyes of a greenish Cast, and he seemed to loath the Food, which he notwithstanding eagerly swallowed. This Personage was called JEALOUSY, and the third by an Openness of Countenance, a strong Ex∣pression of quick Sensibility and cordial Affection, was known to be FRIENDSHIP. Too many gave themselves up to INDIFFERENCE, and instantly an Inattention to each other's Wants succeeded in their Breasts; the Men betook themselves to Midnight Shouts and Re∣velry, and the Fair to Parties of Tea, and Routs, and Drums, by which Means every spark of Love was soon extinguished, and the Gratification of their own separate Inclinations was their only Study.</P>
<P>The Walks of JEALOUSY were craggy, dangerous, and steep, full of Thorns, Briars and Brambles. In the Heart, where before Gladness and Joy revelled secure, arose Anxiety, Distrust, and Perturbation of Spirit. The distempered Fancy started at Scenes of its own Creation, and, in a Fit of Madness, hurried many a tortured Wretch down the Precipice of Fate, or let fall its Vengeance on its Neighbour. What was ob∣servable in this Part was, that though sometimes there were the Appearances, the real Footsteps of Guilt could no where be discovered.</P>
<P>The very small Number under the Guidance of FRIENDSHIP enjoyed a pure heart-felt Tranquillity; and the fierce Desire and impatient Wish, which had formerly actuated their Minds, having now subsided, a steady and uniform Flame succeeded, not unlike the
<PB N="173" REF="184"/>mild refreshing Air of a placid Evening, after the Fer∣vor of an hot Summer's Day. Glad Suns rose over their Heads, and kindly Nights lulled them in each other's Arms. A smiling Race grew up around them, and the Culture of their young and tender Minds af∣forded a pleasing Employment; they journey'd on thro' Life, blessed with the Sunshine of the Soul, till, at length, the easy Dissolution of Nature put a Period to all human Felicity.</P>
<P>Here I could not help exclaiming with the Poet;
<Q><L>O grant me thus to live, and thus to die!</L>
<L>Who sprung from Kings, shall know less Joy than I.</L></Q></P>
<P>The whole Scene appeared so completely happy, that I began to feel some Approaches towards Envy; which so discomposed my Spirits, that I was instantly awaked, and the ideal Prospect vanished into Air.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HERE are few Terms which are applied with greater Impropriety, than those cha∣racteristical Appellations, which Men usual∣ly bestow on their Acquaintance, or on others, in whose Company and Conversation they may at any Time have been casually engaged. Every Cha∣racter, indeed, is formed by the Prevalence of some particular Passion, which influences the Temper, and gives a casting Weight to the Genius of the Person in whom it subsists. But no Rules that I know of, have been yet laid down, nor is there any certain Standard which should fix the Degree of Elevation, to which the ruling Passion must necessarily rise, before it can have Strength sufficient to determine the Character.</P>
<P>The Reader must, however, be informed, that I am not speaking of those moral Qualifications, or Endow∣ments
<PB N="175" REF="186"/>of the Heart, which speculative Writers have taken so much idle Pains to adorn and recommend; and which Men of Sense, or Men of the World, have una∣nimously agreed in rejecting, as unworthy of their se∣rious Notice. The Qualities I mean are pure Vir∣tues of the Head or Face; Properties, which enable the Possessor to assume a solemn Aspect at Incidents, which set the rest of the Table on a Roar; or to inter∣rupt what is truly serious and grave, by impertinent Questions of Levity and Mirth; or lastly, to condemn and cavil, when all the World sees the highest Reasons for Applause and Admiration. The Effects which these Causes produce in Life, however various and compli∣cated in their Appearance, may be reduced to the three general Sources of Wit, Humour, and Criticism, and as the Pretenders to these several Qualities are infinite in Number, I have determined on a certain Standard, in order to regulate and adjust their Claims. The Me∣thod I propose is, to decide their different Pretensions by the Height and Stature of the Body.</P>
<P>And lest this should be considered as a wild chime∣rical Design, I must beg Leave to assure my Reader, that the Theory I am forming is built upon the latest Discoveries, and most uncontroverted Principles of true Philosophy. It is possible however, that Persons of an over-refining Curiosity, may be able to raise some Ob∣jections to what I am going to advance, but as every Thing is liable to be called in Question by those who are disposed to cavil, they will give me but little Pain upon that Head. The plainest Truths have been dis∣puted, and the most extravagant Opinions have been fortunate enough to meet with their Advocates and Ad∣mirers. Now, I would have such People recollect what are the general Apprehensions arising in the Mind, on the Sight of an uncommon Stature; and how favour∣able, withal, even the Notions of the Vulgar are to an unusual Height of Person. Is it not commonly sup∣posed,
<PB N="176" REF="187"/>that Men of this superior Eminence possess as superior Parts, and extraordinary Degrees of Merit. From this Principle, my little Friend of <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> is universally censured, as falling short of a true Hero, by near half a Foot; whilst his more aspiring Antagonist is allowed to have all the necessary Dimensions, re∣quired both by ancient and modern Precedents, to con∣stitute the heroic Character.</P>
<P>It is an Axiom in Philosophy, which few, I hope, will be so hardy as to deny, that the Soul is all and all in every Part. From hence it is obvious, that the Body which is a Covering only for the Aetherial Particle that is lodged within it, must necessarily receive its Di∣mensions from the Vigour of the Spirit, which actuates the exterior Frame. The greater Portion of Fire this Spirit is endued with, its elastic Qualities will be pro∣portionably stronger; and the Dimensions of the Body will be protruded to a Size, exactly of the same Dimen∣sions with the Soul which informs it. On this simple Hypothesis, which I imagine cannot be easily disproved, I proceed to settle the respective Qualifications of the different Pretenders, who have been mentioned above.</P>
<P>In the first Place, those who, with gentle <HI>William</HI> in the Play, boast themselves not on Account of their Wis∣dom, but as they have a <HI>pretty Wit,</HI> do not exceed the lowest Degree of our appointed Standard. It is not in Nature, that such Persons can rise in their Stature, above the Height of five Feet and six Inches. For Wit, which is merely an Exercise of the Tongue, doth not require the same Bulk and Dimensions, which are essen∣tial to Qualifications of a superior Order. It is evi∣dently a much less Exertion of the interior Faculties, than what are productive of that Talent which we call Humour. Hence we must advance a little in our Standard; and can admit no one to be a Man of real Humour, who does not come up to the full Height of five Feet and eight Inches; and this small Progression is the
<PB N="177" REF="188"/>more allowable, as a considerable Part of Humour is frequently expressed by such Feats of Body, as require some little Degree of Size and Strength. Giving a Friend a violent and unexpected Slap upon the Back, or the dexterous Leaping over Chairs and Tables, have been often regarded as so many undoubted Signs of ge∣nuine Humour; and are generally agreed to denote a most facetious Vein of Pleasantry, in the Authors of such exquisite Jokes. It will sometimes further happen, that these two Qualities may be blended in the same Person; as I doubt not but many of my Readers can recollect several of their Acquaintance, who are your only Men of Wit and Humour. Now, this Conjunction manifestly implies a much superior Energy of Soul; and consequently, a still higher Advancement in our Scale of characteristic Excellencies. These Candidates for Fame will accordingly rise two Inches above those who are mentioned last; and none are to pass under this Denomination for the future, but whose Height is five Feet ten. For these Qualities, when thus united, will frequently exert themselves in Strokes of Gallantry and Mirth, which are so much the more honourable as they are dangerous to the Person or the Purse of the ingenious Artist, who has the Courage or Curiosity to attempt the Experiment. The demolishing of Win∣dows, knocking down of Watchmen, bilking of Wai∣ters at Places of Entertainment, with other Instances of the like Kind, are very laudable and convincing Proofs of these compound Qualities, residing together in the same Habitation. The last Quality, which greatly overtops the rest, and is indeed the Crown and Perfec∣tion of all, is the wonderful and most ingenious Faculty of modern Criticism. And as this is, in the most exalted Manner, the Gift of Nature, whoever has the Happi∣ness to be born a true Critic, is at least six Feet com∣plete. A Critic is the Master-piece and noblest Work of Nature; and may justly be expected to bear about
<PB N="178" REF="189"/>him some distinguishing Tokens, which will enable a Spectator, at the first View, to acknowledge and revere his Merits. Hence she has bestowed on him a more than ordinary Portion of the <HI>Daring</HI> and <HI>Tremendous;</HI> and these would appear to very little Effect in a Person of less Dimensions, than those which we have here assigned him. The Wit may be pert and sanguine; the Man of Humour confident or overbearing; but it is the Critic alone, who glares horribly terrific. His every Look freezes the young Author's Blood; and at the Sound of his Voice, the rooted Seats have been known to be torn from the Ground, and hurled vio∣lently through the Air, in furious and wild Commotion. Phaenomena, like these, can only be produced by that iron Strength of Lungs, and brazen Audacity of Fi∣gure, which Nature has so liberally imparted to the modern Critic.</P>
<P>It will be necessary to obviate an Objection arising from popular Prejudice, that the Science of Criti∣cism being to examine into the Merit of all Productions of Genius and Learning, it does not seem to demand the Size and Dimensions which I have made essential to the Character; but the Objectors, I apprehend, are mistaken in the End of modern Criticism; and have not perhaps duly reflected on the necessary Qualities to discharge the Province they are desirous of allotting it. To execute that Task, would require a moderate Por∣tion of Sense, Taste and Judgment, under the Direc∣tion of Modesty and Candour; Talents so little prac∣tised by those who have taken up the Occupation of a a Critic, that they appear on all Occasions not to have the least Conception of them. Whoever will give him∣self Leave to consider, that the Character of a Critic, a Wit, and Man of Humour, in the present Estimation of the World, is supported wholly by Mechanical Ope∣rations, in which the Understanding has no Manner of Share, he will easily agree with me, that the surest
<PB N="179" REF="190"/>Method to discover those Characters, must be taken from that Part which is principally concerned; and as we can truly judge from outward Appearances alone, I have shewn to a Demonstration that the Stature of a Person is the only infallible Criterion, by which we can decide, on the Justness of his Pretensions; and that no one for the future can have any Right to ei∣ther of those Characters, but whose Dimensions will exactly tally with the Measures of this Standard.</P>

<P>The several Writers, who have displayed their Ta∣lents in the elegiack Strain of late Years, seem greatly<PB N="180" REF="191"/>to have mistaken the true End of that sadly-pleasing Species of Poetry, and therefore the following one is recommended to the Perusal of all, who are fond of excelling in this Way.</P>
<DIV5 TYPE="poem">
<HEAD><HI>An</HI> ELEGY <HI>on a Tallow Candle.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>PENSIVE I lay e'en from the Dead of Night,</L>
<L>Until the Sun his daily Course began,</L>
<L>Reflecting on the Candle's wasting Light,</L>
<L>And moraliz'd the Fate of mortal Man.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>White and unsullied was that Cotton Wick,</L>
<L>When from the Chandler first to me it came;</L>
<L>Behold how black! the greasy Drops how thick!</L>
<L>Such Colour takes it from imparted Flame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such is the Youth, of Manners strict and pure,</L>
<L>Till led by Vice he quits his Reason's Guide;</L>
<L>By Flatt'ry drawn he stoops to Vice's Lure,</L>
<L>And from the Paths of Reason wanders wide.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His Passions melt, his manly Vigour faints,</L>
<L>Nor mourns he aught his former Virtue gone,</L>
<L>For foul Society his Moral taints,</L>
<L>And Mother <HI>Douglas</HI> marks him for her own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Fool who sells his Freedom for a Smile,</L>
<L>Or for a Ribband barters Peace of Mind,</L>
<L>Like wasting Wicks just glimmers for a while,</L>
<L>Then dies in Smoke and leaves a Stink behind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The many Perils that Ambition wait,</L>
<L>When soaring high we still the lower fall,</L>
<L>Are but the Snuffers of expiring Light,</L>
<L>And Death's the grand Extinguisher of all.</L>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>FTER sauntering about for some Time the other Morning in <HI>Gray's-Inn-Gardens,</HI> I withdrew to the Edifice raised by the great Sir <HI>Francis Bacon,</HI> where I scarce had seated myself, when I perceived an elderly Gentleman hastening towards me. He was of a ruddy, hale Complexion, but had the Air of one somewhat disconcerted in his Mind. Scraping the Ground with one Leg drawn backwards, and holding out his Hat at Arm's Length, he hesitated a Desire to know if I was Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> the entertaining Writer. Upon answering him in the Affirmative, with Regard to the Name, and at the same Time, expressing some Doubt about the Compliment made to me as an Author, the Gentleman immediately looked grave, and shaking his Head, <Q>Aye, Sir, says he, you are the very Man I want,—I must be a little troublesome to you for your Advice in an Affair that weighs heavily on my Spi∣rits, and a Friend has advised me to apply to Mr. <HI>Ranger</HI> for his Opinion.</Q>—Upon this, I assured him of my Inclination to serve him, and as I perceived he had not yet divested himself of his Diffidence, I begg'd of him to proceed without any farther Ceremony; which he accordingly complied with.</P>
<P><Q>My Name, Sir, reassumed the Stranger, is <HI>Oldcastle,</HI> of <HI>Oldcastle-Hall</HI> in the North of <HI>England,</HI>—nothing
<PB N="182" REF="193"/>but an Affair of Consequence should have brought me upwards of two hundred Miles to Town;—I have fetched my eldest Son up with me, as I think of putting him to something—a wounded sharp Boy he is;— he's a Tartar for your <HI>Greek</HI> and your <HI>Latin,</HI> and the best Mimick in the World;—Odds my Life, he'd mi∣mick all the Waggoners as he come along the Road, —but that's neither here nor there—I now think it Time, as I told you, to put him to Business—I have a large Family, and but a finall Estate was handed to me by my Ancestors;—the Land was surveyed in the Time of <HI>Queen Elizabeth,</HI> and there is just the same Number of Acres to this Day — I would have my Son be the First of his Family that improved it, and then he may help me to provide for his Brother and Sisters—but look ye, Sir, in this large Town, I am mainly puzzled what to put him to;—I am afraid, I have made such another Journey to <HI>London,</HI> as Sir <HI>Francis Wronghead</HI> in the Play, and unless some such good Gentleman as you assists me, I must go back in the old squeaking Stage-Coach, with∣out doing my Business—if you please, I'll step and fetch <HI>Dicky,</HI> he's at the <HI>Bull</HI> and <HI>Gate Inn,</HI> and will be here in a Crack.</Q> Here he paused for a Reply. As the Matter he consulted me upon was of no small Importance, I begged Leave to be silent for the pre∣sent, and promised I would give him an Answer in this Day's Lucubration. Mr. <HI>Oldcastle</HI> was perfectly satis∣fied, and withdrew in the Fullness of his Joy, after as∣suring me, that he would always read my Paper, and that he would leave Orders with the Publisher to send it to his House in the Country every <HI>Saturday</HI> for the future.</P>
<P>The Direction of a young Gentleman's Genius to any particular Profession, is a Point of more Conse∣quence, than perhaps appears to the Inattentive; as to this Step is often to be imputed the Happiness or
<PB N="183" REF="194"/>Misery of the Person in the ensuing Part of his Days. This Circumstance in Life, is not unlike what we see at a Bowling-Green, where, before a Man plays off, he should consider the Byass of his Bowl, and if it is delivered with Judgment, it makes its Way to the de∣stined Point; but, if there should be too much Rapi∣dity in the Outset, or if a proper Degree of Force should be wanting to forward it, it either runs beyond the Mark, or lags in the Middle of its Progress. On this Account it is no easy Matter to advise upon so de∣licate a Point, as I have now to handle.</P>
<P>I have considered all the Professions, and I really think them very precarious. Many great Estates and eminent Titles have been derived from the Law; but it is now reduced to such a State, that without very great Friends, a Person possessed of the Talents of a <HI>Murray,</HI> shall never rise to any Degree of Eminence. With Regard to Physick, a Genius may spend his Time in saving the Lives of Patients in Garrets, and doing real Services to Mankind, without any Emolument to himself, while <HI>Doctor Slaughter</HI> puts his Licence to kill in Execution upon Thousands of his Majesty's well∣disposed Subjects, and lolls at Ease in his Chariot.</P>
<P>In the Army, it is to be feared, that Preferment goes more by Interest, than Merit: And there is not a Wind that can blow from any Quarter of the Heavens, but fills the Merchant's Imagination with pictured Scenes of Shipwrecks; and while he breaks the Seal of a Letter, he trembles for fear of receiving the News of some Correspondent's Failure. The Stage, indeed, seems to be a Place, where Merit meets its Reward, but even there, there are great Disadvantages; and though a Genius should start up with the Talents of a <HI>Garrick,</HI> and Person of a <HI>Barry,</HI> it is odds, but his Eye is one Time or other knock'd out by a well directed Apple.</P>
<P>There is, however, a Way of Life, which I cannot help thinking the most eligible, and, not to keep the
<PB N="184" REF="195"/>Reader any longer in Suspense, the Occupation, I mean, is that of a Gamester. After mature Delibera∣tion, the Gentlemen of this Calling seem to me to be in Possession of greater Advantages than any of the o∣thers, and the Inconveniences attending them, are not upon a Ballance with the Conveniences.</P>
<P>A Gamester, from a constant Habit of venturing large Sums upon the Turning up of a Card, or a Die, acquires that thorough Disregard for Money, which is so much recommended by the Philosophers. Like <HI>Catiline</HI> in <HI>Sallust,</HI> he is <HI>alieni appetens, sui profusis;</HI> at the same Time, that he is desirous of his Friends Substance, he has the Pleasure of being profuse in his own private Gratifications. Instead of creeping through Life with that Mediocrity of Spirit, which depresses the Man of Business, the Gamester lives with an Eclat; <HI>Ryan, Venable,</HI> or <HI>Tomkyns,</HI> supply him with his Wines, and he is every Hour gaining an Insight into Men and Manners. As rude Health has too much of the Country in it, and of course is not very pleasing to the Ladies, he acquires by his midnight Vigil, a pal∣lid meagre Countenance, which generally denotes an intimate Knowledge of the Town; and while others deceive one another in the Face of Day, a Gamester has the Modesty to fly to the Covert of the Night, and, if I may use the Poet's Words, <HI>The pale Moon and Stars alone are conscious of the Theft.</HI> While the Man of Genius is left undisturbed in his Study, the gay-dressed Footman knocks at the Gamester's Doos, and leaves the agreeable Card to invite him to my Lady <HI>Bragwell</HI>'s. There he has an Opportunity of carrying on a Design upon a Lady's Money and Vir∣tue at the same Time, and if he can once contrive to get her in his Books, he sinds it no difficult Matter to make her give <HI>personal</HI> Security, and when once a Woman's Body is mortgaged, there is no Equity of Redemption.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="196"/>There are many other Conveniences annexed to a Life of Play, and therefore I would have my Friend Mr. <HI>Oldcastle</HI> train up his Son to this Profession; and to encourage all Beginners in this Way, I shall dismiss this Paper with only one Article of True Intelligence, which I take to be of the utmost Consequence to all such Adventurers.</P>

<HEAD>TRUE INTELLIGENCE.</HEAD>
<HEAD><HI>To the</HI> PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>LATELY arrived in this Town from <HI>Paris,</HI> the <HI>Marquis de Fourberie,</HI> well known to many of the Nobility and Gentry, who have been in Foreign Parts. He is well versed in all the different Branches of Gam∣ing, and he teaches how to play the whole Game in a Month's Time.</P>
<P>He has taken an Apartment for this Purpose in the <HI>Hay-market,</HI> where he reads Lectures every Day in the Week, except <HI>Wednesday,</HI> when he attends the Gentle∣men of the City, at his Room near the <HI>Royal Exchange,</HI> where he will let any young Prentice or City Smart into the Secret, without Hindrance of Business.</P>
<P>He has taught, since his coming here, several Game∣sters of both Sexes, and it was he instructed the <HI>Sca∣ramouch,</HI> who carried off fifteen hundred Pounds from the last Masquerade.</P>
<P>Gentlemen and Ladies may learn in a private Man∣ner, without being overseen by Strangers while Learn∣ing, and for the more expeditiously compleating them, there is a Set to practise from Seven in the Evening till Three in the Morning.</P>
<P>As several Persons have, and do think still, that it is impossible to learn without going into Company, he thinks proper to inform them of his Method for that Purpose. He first teaches the Scholar the Shuffle, then the different Methods of Cutting; next he explains his
<PB N="186" REF="197"/>Rules, by the Assistance of second-hand Cards; when the Party is so qualified, he makes his own Family sit down with them, where they play most of the Games in Vogue; after the Person has learned in this Manner, which he or she may do in a very short Time, he dares answer for them, they will be qualified to play in any genteel Company whatever.</P>
<P><HI>Jacta est alea.</HI></P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> the <HI>Marquis</HI> had not a Stitch of Cloaths when he began, and he now shines away with his <HI>Dresden</HI> Ruffles, and Diamond Ring. Such Persons as are de∣sirous to learn any Branch excessive quick, may come twice or thrice a Day, or lodge and board in the House for the Time. He insures for a small Praemium, one thousand Pounds a Year to any ingenious young Gen∣tleman who will make himself Master of his Rules. He sells Dice for Gentlemen to carry in their Pockets.</P>

<Q><L>Ausus non operam, non formidare Poetae</L>

<L>Monstratum digito.—</L>
<BIBL><HI>PRAEDIUM RUSTICUM.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">D</SEG>ERISION and Contempt have been for many Ages the Portion of most Authors, whom Rank in Life, or Superiority of Abilities, have not eminently raised above the common Herd of their Fraternity; and the Name of Poet, in every Company where the Word is men∣tioned,
<PB N="187" REF="198"/>is sure to excite ludicrous Ideas of Garrets, unwashed Shirts, and unpaid Taylors. By these Means it has obtained, that younger Brothers had rather take a Pistol or a Pack of Cards in their Hands to raise a Livelihood, than endeavour to help out the Year's In∣come by the Exertion of their Talents; dreading the Infamy of Wit, more than any other Imputation, that can be fixed upon their Characters.</P>
<P>This Effect is not produced without a Concurrence of many efficient Causes, among which the principal one is, the known Poverty of the Generality of the Tribe that write; and among all the Inconveniences of Indigence, it has been well said, that there is not a greater Hardship, than that Ridicule, which it brings upon those who labour under its Lash.</P>
<Q><L>Nil habit infaelix Paupertas durius in se,</L>
<L>Quam quod ridiculos homines facit.—</L></Q>
<P>The Belly has been often called the Teacher of Art, and the Inspirer of Wit; but, I apprehend, this Maxim can only be understood of a full Belly.</P>
<Q>Satur est cum dicit Horatius Evoe;</Q>
<P><HI>Horace</HI> was warmed with good Cheer, when he calls out to <HI>Bacchus</HI> to spare him, says <HI>Juvenal;</HI> and the same Author adds, with an elegant Vein of Pleasantry, that fine Writing is the Production of an exalted Mind, free from the Sollicitude of procuring a Blanket; and that if <HI>Virgil</HI> wanted a Lodging and a Boy to attend him, the Snakes would fall from the Fury, which he so admirably describes, and the Trumpet would not sound to War with so shrill a Clangor.
<Q><L>Nam si Virgilio puer &amp; tolerabile deesset</L>
<L>Hospitium, caderent omnes à crinibus Hydri,</L>
<L>Surda nibil gemeret grave Buccina.—</L></Q>
<PB N="188" REF="199"/>It is not therefore to be wondered, that Poverty should diminish the Poet's Lustre, since it not only renders him an Object of Contempt, but extinguishes the Fire of his Genius; and such is the Fate or Perverseness of Au∣thors, that, to Circumstances, which they cannot re∣move, they are industrious to add many of their own creating; so true is the Saying of Mr. <HI>Congreve,</HI> that wherever Wit is, it is always contriving its own Ruin. The Race of Writers are extremely irascible, prone to Malice and Envy towards the Man, whom they per∣ceive in Possession of Fame, and, instead of endeavour∣ing to equal him with an honest Emulation, their Aim is, to snatch the Laurel from his Brow, or if they can∣not reach it, to wither it on his Head by the bitter Blasts of Calumny and Detraction. <HI>Voltaire</HI> delivers himself on this Topic with so much Delicacy and good Sense, that I shall here translate the Passage. <Q>It is a Disgrace, <HI>says he,</HI> to the human Mind, that the Re∣public of Letters should be infested with personal Resentments, private Cabals, and mean Intrigues, which should only subsist among the Slaves of For∣tune. What Advantage can accrue to Authors from this Civil War? Their Animosities have no other Tendency, than to depreciate a Profession, which it is in their Power to render respectable. Why should the Art of thinking finely, the greatest Bles∣sing Man can share from Heaven, become an Object of Ridicule? It is really hard, that Men of Genius should render themselves, by their mutual Invectives, the Sport of Pools, and instead of being revered as the Masters and Instructors of the Public, turn out the Buffoons and Zanies of the Town.</Q></P>
<P>There is another Reason, which contributes strongly to bring a Disreputation upon Poets, and that is, their mean and prostitute Servility to a Set of Men, whom they call their Patrons. These Gentlemen are for the most Part eager after Praise, and careless of the Means,
<PB N="189" REF="200"/>by which they might obtain an honest Fame; hence the <HI>Parnassian</HI> Incense is extremely grateful, and is there∣fore profusely offered up by every scribbling Fool, who vainly thinks to wriggle himself into Preferment. But the Misfortune is, that what happens in this Case is not answerable to the Writer's Intention; his Patron plumes himself upon the imputed Accomplishments, and glows with Rapture and Self Admiration, while for the Bard he feels no Passion but Contempt, and the rest of the World with Pleasure behold Infamy and Disappoint∣ment, the Rewards of Venality and Prostitution.</P>
<P>As I have always entertained great good Wishes for the Gentlemen of the Quill, I have devised a Method, by the Observance of which, they will be able to re∣trieve, in some Measure, the Honour of their Calling, and obviate that Torrent of Contumely, which at pre∣sent bears hard upon them.</P>
<P>In the first Place, I would have them frequently in∣culcate, that Fortune is only the Deity of Fools; and, if she has not been favourable to them, they had better enjoy a virtuous Independence in private, than by an ambitious Poverty, bring themselves under the Contempt and Ridicule of the Affluent.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Instead of wasting Paper in mutual Calumny and Detraction, I would recommend to them to vent their Anger upon the Critics or the <HI>Male-voli;</HI> a Species of People highly prejudicial to the Cause of Literature, on whom no Severities can be too hard, as it is no∣torious, that not one of the Race about Town at pre∣sent is any way fit for the Province he has usurped; a total Ignorance of the learned Languages, and a la∣mentable want of Taste, together with a plentiful Share of Spleen and Ill-nature, being the distinguish∣ing Characteristics of the whole Tribe.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly</HI> and <HI>lastly,</HI> I would advise my Brother. Wri∣ters to dispense their Panegyric with a little more Re∣serve, and always with an Eye to Truth; from whence<PB N="190" REF="201"/>it will follow, that they will find themselves more court∣ed by their Patrons, and their Butlers will the more readily condescend to hear them from the Side-Board. <HI>To maintain a Poet's Dignity and Ease,</HI> is a beautiful Sentiment of Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> and his Life and Manners shew that he carried it from Theory into Fractice. Who is not delighted to hear him declare with a noble Pride?
<Q><L>Enough for half the greatest of these Days,</L>
<L>To 'scape my Censure, not expect my Praise.</L></Q> Whenever I reflect upon the Conduct of that great Genius, I find it hard to determine within myself, which holds most of Admiration, the Fineness of his Per∣ceptions, and the Elegance of his Poetry, or that Grace of Character, and that unprostituted, dignified In∣dependence, which will always do Honour to the Man. Doctor <HI>Swift</HI> likewise, with less Delicacy of Manners, jealously preserved his own Respect; and sure I am, that the Writings of these two great Authors, though they have both exquisite Finishings in their Kind, have always received an additional Lustre from the self-created Importance of their Characters.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HERE is not a Pleasure, which thrills through the tender Nerve of Imagination, but what receives additional Delight from numberless adventitious Circumstances. To the <HI>Association of Ideas,</HI> explained by Mr. <HI>Locke,</HI> may also be added the <HI>Association of Passions,</HI> which recipro∣cally
<PB N="192" REF="203"/>awaken each other, and agitate the Mind with their mixed Operation. Thus the primary Effect, which any Object or Landskip may have on a Person's Taste, is heightened and enlarged beyond its Bounds; a Recollection of collateral Images starts upon the Fancy, the Passions pour in their auxiliar Influence, and our Joy is encreased by several Sensations at once; like a River, which admits at different Inlets the tri∣butary Illapse of several lesser Streams, and thence swelled above its Banks, dispenses Verdure and Fertility to all the Country round. That this is the Case in many Situations of the Mind, will be obvious to any Body, that will but turn his Eyes inwards, and I be∣lieve it is not more so in any one Instance, than the Joy we seel from the Opening of the Spring.</P>
<P>In my Opinion, we are not acquainted with a more complicated Pleasure: our Love of Novelty, which is a leading Principle in the Heart of Man, implanted in us for the most benevolent Purposes by the Author of our Frame, is particularly gratified at this Season of the Year; the Appearance, which Things assume, is not only pleasing to us on Account of its natural Beau∣ty, but also from its Newness to the Eye. During the Winter, all Nature seems to suffer a melancholy Distress; the animal Creation droops, their Spirits seem sunk into dumb Despair, and we read their languid Situation in the mute imploring Eye; the vegetable World seems also tending to Decay, and a general Scene of Calamity overspreads the Face of Nature. From this State to see gradually a new Creation emerging, and every Thing reviving with renovated Vigour, cannot fail of pleasing our Imagination; the whole Race of animal Life feels the genial Influence of the soft Season; from a Turbulence of Clouds, and all the Inclemencies of the Elements, the Scene is shifted to enlivening Suns, blue Skies, Hills cloathed with Verdure, imbowering
<PB N="193" REF="204"/>Shades, refreshing Streams, and the Harmony of the Grove.</P>
<P>The learned Reader will perceive with what Elegance <HI>Virgil</HI> has described this vernal Delight in the Words of my Motto. The Passage, from whence I have se∣lected these Lines, is carried on with an Air of En∣thusiasm; he seems particularly fond of this Season, and the whole is closed with a moral Reflection on the Providence of the supreme Being, who placed this Part of the Year, as a Medium, to render the Transi∣tion from intense Cold to the Heat of the Summer less perceptible to our Constitutions. There are many short Sketches of this Nature in the same Author; we frequently find him casting a side Glance this Way; and, I will venture to say, every Reader of Taste must have been greatly delighted with these Bye-views; as on a Road the transient Opening of an agreeable Prospect is always acceptable to the Traveller. <HI>Horace</HI> is also happy when giving a Description of the Spring; and <HI>Milton,</HI> the great Father of the Sublime in <HI>English</HI> Poesy, has in many Places touched it with great Delicacy. Per∣haps some of the most beautiful Imagery in his Poem is to be found in the softer Paintings of this Nature, which he has so often taken Occasion to introduce.</P>
<P>Besides the obvious Pleasures of this Season, already mentioned, there is another Circumstance, which still renders it more delightful; the Spring, more particularly than any other Time of the Year, is the Season of Love. At this Juncture we feel the Sun warm at our Hearts; young Health smiles in the Virgin's Eye; the Morn or Evening Walks affords Sensations unfelt before; a pleas∣ing Stillness runs o'er the Faculties of the Mind, and every Thing conspires to fill the Heart, with what the Poet calls, <HI>the Spirit of Love and amorous Delight.</HI> By Love, I would not be supposed to mean a mere gross Impulse of Passion, but that Elegance of Desire, that Refinement of Taste, which distinguishes the Gen∣tleman,
<PB N="194" REF="205"/>and never fails of being acceptable to the amiable Sex.</P>
<P>Whatever may be rattled over a Bottle at a Tavern, we are obliged to the Ladies for the most valuable Gratifica∣tions of our Lives; and after all our high-boasted Rea∣son and our superior Abilities, to them it is owing that our Manners become more gentle, and our Sentiments acquire a finer Polish. Our Looks and Gestures assume from them a molder Air, our Passions soften into Har∣mony and Joy; and the Man, who has used himself to this agreeable Converse, is acquainted with a thou∣sand Delicacies in his Amusements, and several Elegan∣cies in his Way of thinking, to which vulgar Souls are absolutely Strangers.</P>
<P>Instead of expatiating further on this Subject, I shall here insert a Copy of Verses, which were communi∣cated to me by an ingenious Gentleman, whom I am proud to call my Friend. The candid Reader, I per∣suade myself, will be pleased with the Perusal; and the small Critics, who buzz about the <HI>Gray's-Inn Journal,</HI> may amuse themselves with considering, whether the Lines should be called, Ode, Song, Pastoral, or Elegy, and whether they sufficiently express the Tenderness of Love, and the Process of the Passion, with its several sweet Vicissitudes.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is with unspeakable Pleasure I have observed for a considerable Time past, that those unhappy Divisions, which have been the Bane of Society, ever since the late Commotions in the North, are in a great Measure re∣conciled; at least, so far, as to make an Intercourse be∣tween People of different political Sentiments, not al∣together impracticable. The Distinction of <HI>Whig,</HI> or <HI>Jacobite,</HI> seems to be at present thought not essentially necessary towards constituting a good Companion; and the Word HONEST appears to have acquired a more en∣larged
<PB N="198" REF="209"/>Signification; insomuch that, whenever we ho∣nour a Man with that Appellation, it is generally under∣stood, that we mean something more, than a Person who is ready to drink a certain Set of Toasts. In short, the Enthusiasm of Party, in this Respect, is so far abated, that one may spend a chearful Evening with some of the most sanguine Friends to the Government, without dedicating a single Glass to the Memory of King <HI>William;</HI> and I have more than once, within these last six Months, sat with some reputed Well-wishers to the exiled Family, without being under a Necessity of ungartering my Stockings, and pulling off my Wig, at every Return of the Bottle. But, alas! what avails this Coalition? The Spirit of Party is so intimately in∣terwoven in the Constitution of an <HI>Englishman,</HI> that all Attempts to extinguish it must inevitably fail of Suc∣cess: It may indeed be diverted, but will not admit of being eradicated.</P>
<P>The Truth of this Observation is sufficiently mani∣fested, by the two powerful Factions, which now dis∣unite this great Metropolis.</P>
<P>I could wish for the Pen of <HI>Bolingbroke,</HI> in order to trace the Rise and Progress of those fatal Dissensions, which sow Discord in Families, make Breaches among Friends, embitter Society, and, if not timely restrained, threaten Danger to the State.</P>
<P>The Reader, I believe, has anticipated me, and plainly sees, that I can mean no other, than the Sects, distinguished by the Denomination of <HI>Garrickeans</HI> and <HI>Barryists.</HI></P>
<P>The several Pretensions of the Theatrical Leaders, from whom the Names of Distinction just mentioned are derived, are so extremely difficult to be adjusted, that two Persons can hardly be found, within the Cities of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Westminster,</HI> who persectly agree in their Way of thinking upon this Head: And as the amiable Sex generally support, with great Impetuosity, their
<PB N="199" REF="210"/>favourite Principles, it is inconceivable to those, who have not had Opportunity of observing it, what Feuds and Animosities prevail among the female Partizans of these Heroes.</P>
<P>I was lately present at a Controversy between two Ladies, who had adopted opposite Sentiments, the one being a <HI>Garrickean,</HI> and the other a <HI>Barryist.</HI> The Dispute be∣gan in Form—the <HI>Garrickean</HI> insisting upon it, that she did not like <HI>Barry;</HI> and the <HI>Barryist</HI> protesting with equal Emphasis, that she could not so highly admire <HI>Gar∣rick</HI>—Thus mutual Contradiction being given, the Debate soon grew warm, and the <HI>Garrickean</HI> Lady enforced her Opinion with great Vehemence: <Q>There is something so clever, something so lively, something so I don't know how in <HI>Garrick</HI>—And his Eyes sparkle so, that, to be sure, he is the sweetest Creature in the World.</Q>—Her Antagonist withstood this Torrent of Eloquence, and with no less Energy replied,— <Q>Nay, Madam, if you talk of Eyes, nobody can say, but <HI>Barry</HI> has as lovely Eyes as ever were seen—Then he is so tall, and so fine a Man, that, Lord bless me! there is no Comparison—I am sure, <HI>Garrick</HI> can't make Love so well—come, now, you must give that up.—Not I, upon my Honour, Ma'em, resumes the <HI>Garrickean,</HI> why should I give it up? All the Gentlemen, and you must allow they know best, say, <HI>Garrick</HI> is the finest <HI>Romeo.</HI></Q>—The Weight of this Reasoning piqued the <HI>Barryist,</HI> and she exclaimed, with no small Appearance of Indignation—<Q>Pshaw! what signifies what the Men say? I don't mind it a Farthing;—they envy the dear Man, because he is so handsome.</Q>—The Earnestness and Resent∣ment, with which this was delivered, excited a general Laugh, and the Ladies had Prudence enough to suspend the Contest for that Evening; but I have been since informed, that they renewed it the next Day with re∣doubled Vigour, and proceeded so far, as to use some<PB N="200" REF="211"/>certain Figures of Speech, which are thought not quite consistent with female Delicacy.</P>
<P>A wide Breach ensued between the Disputants, in Consequence of this Disagreement, which was in a few Days happily healed, by the Mediation of some Friends; and the Ladies now visit as usual, but have obliged themselves in the most solemn Manner, for their mutual Quiet, never to mention, for the future, the Names of <HI>Garrick</HI> and <HI>Barry</HI> in the Company of each other.</P>
<P>I have only related this Affair, as a slight Instance of the unhappy Effects attending our Party-Divisions. That they are productive of the greatest Uneasiness in the Conjugal State, is so very notorious, that People of different Ways of thinking seldom chuse to engage with each other; being aware, that Feuds and Discon∣tents must be unavoidable, when Man and Wife <HI>do not go the same Way.</HI> An intimate Acquaintance of mine, who is strongly in the <HI>Garrickean</HI> Interest, paid his Ad∣dresses to a very agreeable, and every-way-accomplish'd young Lady; but a violent <HI>Barryist.</HI> The young Couple liked one another perfectly well, and there appeared no reasonable Objection to the Match, but the Difference of Principles.</P>
<P>This, however, was an Obstacle not easily to be got over. The Relations on both Sides had several Meet∣ings, and many Difficulties arose in settling this Point, which was at last adjusted by a Compromise. The Lawyer, who was employed to draw the Articles, re∣ceived Directions to insert a Clause, importing, that all the Boys born of that Marriage should be bred up <HI>Garrickeans,</HI> and the Girls <HI>Barryists.</HI></P>
<P>The Reader, I believe, is surprized, that I have not, in this Dissertation upon Parties, taken any Notice of the <HI>Quinists,</HI> a Faction, which, in its Time, has been by no Means contemptible, whether we consider the Bulk or Quality of the Leaders. The Reason is—I have observed, that this Party is considerably declined,
<PB N="201" REF="212"/>since the Abdication of their Monarch; most of them having subscribed to the Revolution, which took Place in <HI>Goodman</HI>'s-<HI>Fields</HI> in the Year Forty-two; and those few, who still continue attached to this Cause, being old Men, from whom no Disturbance can be expected in the female World.</P>
<P>That these Heart-burnings threaten Danger to the State, I think is very obvious. The Business of the Theatres is almost finished, and, it is expected, that both Houses will be prorogued in a few Days, when many of the Members will go into the Country, and most unquestionably excite a Party-Spirit, where-ever they fix. We shall hear from one Town, that the In∣habitants are divided into <HI>Marrists</HI> and <HI>Scrasists;</HI> from another, that the <HI>Usherists</HI> have got the upper Hand, and the Favourers of <HI>Raftor</HI> do not dare to shew their Faces. What Influence these Divisions may have upon the approaching Election, I leave to the Gentle∣men in Power to consider, not doubting but they will thank me for this friendly Intimation, and make a pro∣per Use of it.</P>
<P>From this fair and candid Representation of the pre∣sent State of Parties among us, many useful Reflections may be drawn, which, as they are extremely obvious, the Reader's good Sense will undoubtedly suggest to him. I might here dismiss my Subject in the Words of <HI>Horace,</HI>
<Q>Verbum non amplius addam.</Q></P>
<P>But I am unwilling to conclude, without declaring my own Principles. I have the Satisfaction to say, that I am conscious of being entirely free of Party-Prejudice —I am neither a <HI>Garrickean</HI> nor a <HI>Barryist,</HI> but be∣tween both, in an honest Mean—I defy my greatest Enemies to prove, that I ever gave a Clap or Hiss, but according to the Dictates of my Conscience— And, O my dear Countrymen and Countrywomen!
<PB N="202" REF="213"/>there is nothing I so ardently desire, as an Union of all true Friends to our Theatrical Entertainments, in order to rouze the Directors of the <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> and <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> Companies from their Lethargy, and make them sensible, that though the Public have a violent Appe∣tite for Plays, and can feed on a <HI>Romeo</HI> and <HI>Juliet</HI> thirty or forty Times in a Season, yet they would be glad of a little Variety—This surely they may modestly ex∣pect, as the heavy Subsidies for the Maintenance of these States are raised entirely upon them. If we should be happy enough to obtain this, next Winter, I flatter myself, all Discord will subside: We shall admire the Powers of a <HI>Garrick,</HI> and do Justice to his inimitable Performances in a <HI>Lear,</HI> a <HI>Richard,</HI> a <HI>Macbeth,</HI> an <HI>Hamlet,</HI> a <HI>Ranger,</HI> or a <HI>Bendick,</HI> without being any Way disinclined to yield to the tender Emotions of a <HI>Castalio,</HI> or backward to acknowledge the Dignity and home-felt Anguish of an <HI>Othello.</HI> In short, we shall then enter the Theatre, without any other Biass on our Minds, than a Disposition to be pleased.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Sentiment, which is very beautifully expressed in the Words of my Motto, grew naturally out of the Conversation, at the last Meeting of our Club; and to enforce it still further, Mr. <HI>Gulliver,</HI> who then occupied the Chair, produced a Stricture of oriental History, which, he believed, would impress the Reflection deeper on the Mind, as it carried with it the Admonitions of Expe∣rience; and therefore, as such, I shall recommend it to the Perusal of my Readers.</P>
<P>In the Chronicles of the Sultans of the East, it is recorded, that when <HI>Othman</HI> held the Rank of Visier under a Prince of the <HI>Sassanian</HI> Race, and by his faith∣ful Councils added Security, Lustre, and Dignity to the Throne, his Son <HI>Mustapha</HI> display'd in his early Bloom all the Virtues which could endear him to the best of Fathers, and render him amiable in the Eyes of all Be∣holders. <HI>Achmet</HI> the Hermit, who had been called forth from his Retreat, in order to attend the Cultiva∣tion of his tender Mind, had taken care to season him with Religion, and to inflame his young Imagination with the Desire of a fair and honest Fame. The Sage well knew that this Propensity would be a strong se∣condary
<PB N="205" REF="216"/>Aid to the native Beauty of Virtue, would warm and cherish his native Goodness, and invigorate the Exertion of it. Accordingly <HI>Mustapha</HI> soon drew the Eyes of all Men upon him; his Conduct was a con∣stant Emanation of Benevolence, and in his Bosom glowed that intense heroic Ardour, which soon after distin∣guished him in the Field of glorious Danger. In a short Time he arrived to the highest Degree of Popula∣rity; the Sultan heaped Favours on him in what might be called a Profusion of Liberality, had not his Merit daily deserved it from him. He was delegated with un∣limited Authority to command the Armies of the Sul∣tan, and from the Confines of <HI>Persia</HI> to the <HI>Indian</HI> Ocean, he soon reduced every Thing under Subjection. Though he was yet green in Years, each Tongue was mute in his Presence, and before him every Eye looked down with a Kind of reverential Awe; he loved the Prince, who raised him to this State of Elevation, and by the Gentleness of his Manners he softened that Envy, which might otherwise arise against the Lustre of his Glory.</P>
<P>While <HI>Mustapha</HI> was constantly reaping fresh Laurels, and gratifying his insatiable Love of Fame by daily Ac∣quisitions of Glory, his Father at home met with a Reverse of Fortune. <HI>Othman</HI> possessed all those Quali∣ties, which shone forth in his Son with a more striking Lustre; and he vainly imagined, that in a corrupt de∣generate Court, he could be great and good with Im∣punity. But the Storm now gathered heavily in Clouds around him, and the turbulent Tempests of Jealousy, Ambition, Hatred, and Revenge environed him with a Whirlwind more dreadful than that which tears up whole Continents of Sand in the Desarts of <HI>Arabia.</HI> The grand Apartments in his House, which were for∣merly filled with a Band of Courtiers, were now empty and forlorn; he was divested of all his Honours; his Trust was taken away from him, and, after a Series
<PB N="206" REF="217"/>of Years spent in the Service of his Prince, he was stripped of every Thing but his paternal Estate; whi∣ther he withdrew to shelter himself from an ungrateful World.</P>
<P>In this Retirement, <HI>Othman,</HI> what were your Thoughts, what were your Sensations? The Sun ushered in a Day void of Occupation, and the Night a Train of restless Dreams. At length his Constitution received such se∣vere Strokes from a constant Succession of corrosive Cares, that he languished under the Pressure, and his Soul sickened to Desperation. A gloomy visionary Light obscured his Eyes with dim Suffusion, and he beheld with Joy the approaching Sunset of his Days. As he lay languishing on the Bed of Sickness, he gave Orders, that his Son might be informed of his Situation. <HI>Mustapha</HI> immediately quitted his high Command, flew to his dying Father's languid Arms, and in a Gush of Tears embraced his agonizing Body. <HI>Othman,</HI> with what little Strength he had left, raised his Head, and fixing his faded Eye-balls on him, "My Son, said he," hear my Words: <Q>You have beheld your Father in the Sunshine of Prosperity; you now behold him in the last Extreme of Misery. I am fallen a Prey to the Intrigues of ill-designing Men;—the Angel of Death now hovers over his Victim; then listen to my last Directions;—Avoid pub∣lic Honours;—fly from Courts, as from the Monsters of the Desart; be not misled by a vain Love of Fame and an unavailing Popularity;—Virtue is its own Reward;—then let your Happiness be fixed in your own Mind, independent of external Objects;—de∣spise the Opinions of Mankind, which are always fluctuating and uncertain as the <HI>Caspian,</HI> when de∣formed with Tempests.—For the Remainder of your Days have a Contempt for Fame;—it will only lead you into a Series of Toils for an ungrate∣ful World.—Steal through Life imperceptible, like
<PB N="207" REF="218"/>the Path of the Arrow, which leaves no Trace be∣hind it;—let your Moderation shade you from Envy, and look down upon the Giddy.</Q>—</P>
<P>He could no more; his Lot for Eternity was cast, and he expired. <HI>Mustapha</HI> wept in Bitterness of Anguish over the best of Fathers; he treasured up his Precepts in the inmost Recesses of his Soul, and instantly began to conform his Conduct to the Practice of them. His Dignities and Honours he resigned forthwith, and in the Sullenness of his Soul he locked himself from the World. His House no longer resounded with Singers and with Minstrels; no longer did Amber and Aloes administer their rich Perfumes; the Vases of Agate, which in his Father's Time overflowed with all the de∣licious Liquors of the East, lay tumbled into an unre∣garded Heap; and even the Hand of Charity, which was before stretched out at his Gate, was now con∣gealed and frozen up. Echo no longer repeated his Praises, and Scandal began to accumulate Disgrace upon him. This he heard, and he despised the Rumour; the many Lessons given him by his Tutor were now totally forgot; the Seeds of Virtue lay dormant in his Breast, and his Love of Fame was now entirely extin∣guished, nay, the very Thoughts of it were loathsome to him, insomuch that, to leave no room for a Suspi∣cion that he had any the least Regard for Popularity re∣maining, he would often say to himself, <Q>That the World may see how much I am above any Notices it may take of me, I must not be guilty of a single good Action.</Q>—By imperceptible Degrees this Turn of Mind settled into a fixed Insensibility to all Dignity of Character, and on the Contempt of <HI>Fame</HI> was grafted a Contempt of <HI>Virtue.—Mustapha! Mu∣stapha!</HI> you thundered at the Head of Armies; whole Nations obeyed your Voice; and now, how altered! relaxed and enfeebled you groan in Anguish, reluct∣ant

<P>It was with Difficulty he gained Admission; but the Gates were no sooner opened for him, than he went streight to his young Pupil's Apartment. <HI>Mustapha</HI> was reclined upon a Sofa, his Looks sullenly fixed on the Ground, and his Mind hardening into Insensibility. <HI>Achmet</HI> eagerly presented himself before him. His Eyes were vivid and piercing, though the Quickness of their Lustre was somewhat diminished by the galling Effusion of Tears, which this unexpected Shock had cost him. The Winter of Age had shed its Snows upon his Head and Beard and the lively Expression of Passions, which throbbed in mingled Tumult about his Heart, rendered him an alarming Object to his Pupil. A conscious Blush diffused itself over his Face, at Sight of the hoary Sage; and both their Sensations being too big for Ut∣terance, their Tongues were suspended, and their Eyes overflowing discoursed for a while in the most eloquent pathetic Silence. At length <HI>Achmet</HI> faintly uttered <HI>"Mustapha!"</HI> and a Gush of Tears choaked up the rest. <HI>Mustapha</HI> at this was covered with Confusion, and at∣tempted to break from him; but the palsied Nerves of the venerable Hermit felt a Renovation of Strength from the glowing Purpose of his Soul, and laying fast hold of his Pupil, he exclaimed, <Q>You shall not put me from you; in me your Genius now alarms you; by me it means to rouze you from your Lethargy, and awaken the dying Embers of that amiable Fire, which formerly kindled all your Spirits, in those happier Days, when my Instructions were refreshing to your Ears, as the Morning Dews to the Verdure, which cloaths the Fields of <HI>Damascus.</HI> But now, how art thou fallen! each finer Principle of Virtue is sup∣pressed, and you are even deaf to the Voice of Fame, that sweetest Music to a virtuous Ear. But to re∣deem
<PB N="212" REF="223"/>thee at once from the Dreams of Folly and over-weening Pride, in which thy Soul is now slug∣gishly immersed, read there that mystic Truth, which a <HI>Genie</HI> put into my Hand, in an Hour of Inspira∣tion, when my Thoughts were swelled with sublime Ideas of the Dispensations of him, who is in the Heaven of Heavens, and whose wonder-working Hand launched forth the Planets into the illimitable Void, and still continueth to produce the Harmony of the physical and moral World by various Secrets and indirect Causes.</Q></P>
<P>The Heart of <HI>Mustapha</HI> was alarmed, and he read as follows. <Q>When VIRTUE was sent down from the third Heaven to restrain the irregular Passions of Mankind, the Dignity of her Mien and Beauty of her Aspect were sufficiently attractive to make her admired of all Beholders. But such is the Depravity of human Nature, that these Allurements soon began to lose of their Influence, and VIRTUE shortly finding herself neglected and forlorn, returned to her celestial Mansion, in order to prefer her Complaint against the Sons of Men. There she remonstrated, that blind Mankind was not only insensible to her personal Charms, but also deaf to the Promise of Rewards, which were to be dispensed to her Votaries in a future State of Existence. Though this was a sufficient Pro∣vocation of Wrath, yet such was the supreme Benevo∣lence, that VIRTUE was again sent down upon her Mission; and the better to strengthen her Interests, FAME was ordered to attend her, with an high Com∣mission to dispense temporary Retributions even on this Side of the Grave. As soon as they reached the Verge of human Nature, FAME blew aloft her silver Trumpet, and an instantaneous Glow was kindled in all Hearts. Wherever VIRTUE was cherished, FAME pursued her Footsteps; and if Court was any where made to her alone, she was sure to withold her Fa∣vours,
<PB N="213" REF="224"/>until the Candidates found Means, by the Re∣commendation of VIRTUE, to insinuate themselves in∣to her good Graces. By this amiable Union Mankind were restrained within just Restrictions, and were ex∣cited to a Series of meritorious Actions, either by an Attachment to the Allurements of VIRTUE, or from a Desire of obtaining the Applause of FAME. But short is the Duration of all sublunary Things. FAME, in her Turn, began to share the same Fate, that VIR∣TUE had met before her; the Appetites of Men were now well-nigh sated, and the Musick of Applause no longer sounded grateful to the Ear. It was observa∣ble that wherever she met with a Repulse, VIRTUE was soon known to follow her, and it very rarely happened that she remained with above one or two in an Age without her Attendant FAME. In Pro∣cess of Time Matters were carried to that Extremity, that this celestial Pair were tired of their Pilgrimage, and wearied out at length they resolved to offer up a joint Petition to be recalled. They therefore flew to the Throne of him who is in the Heaven of Heavens, and humbly urged, that it was in vain for them to sojourn any longer upon Earth, as deluded Mankind was now entirely seduced by the spurious Ornaments of the Monster VICE, which had issued out of the Regions of Darkness, and set up in Op∣position to all that VIRTUE and FAIR FAME could inspire. In this Instance again the tender Care of Heaven was eminently displayed, and these two radiant Beings were a second Time commanded to return to Earth, with Directions, that, however de∣praved the Appetites of Men might be, they should persist in an unremitted Course of Endeavours for their Service. But the more effectually to strengthen their Cause, a Fiend called INFAMY was ordered to issue forth from the unhallowed Cell of VICE, and to adhere close to her, whatsoever Way she should bend her Course.
<PB N="214" REF="225"/>It was likewise ordained that whoever should betray a Disregard for VIRTUE and HONEST FAME, should be branded by INFAMY, and that these two should thus continue to wander among Mankind, until the Angel of Death should walk forth by the Command of the ALMIGHTY, and sweep the whole Race from the Face of the Earth, to receive that Retribution of Rewards and Punishments, which may be due to their VIRTUE or VICE.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Mustapha</HI> now perceived the Mists of Error clearing away from before his Understanding; he embraced <HI>Achmet,</HI> and poured out the Effusions of his Gratitude for thus recalling him to the Task of Virtue, whose Strength consists in Activity. He acknowledged that the Transition is easy from a Contempt of Fame to an equal Disregard for the Virtues that deserve it; and the Name of <HI>Mustapha</HI> during the Remainder of the Chro∣nicles of this Reign makes a distinguished Figure, and it is said that he closed a Life of VIRTUE with Honour and Renown.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T occurred to me the other Day, as I was sitting in my Study, that I had contracted a very heavy Debt, on the Score of Visit∣ing; and being willing to discharge the Demands upon me as expeditiously as possible. I deter∣mined to dedicate an entire Evening to the Settlement of this Account. I accordingly writ my Name upon about fifteen Pieces of Card, and fallied out upon this important Business. At most of the Places, where I
<PB N="216" REF="227"/>called, I had no Occasion to alight, but discharged my Obligation, by delivering to the Footman at the Door one of the Tokens of modern Friendship above men∣tion'd; I had, however, the good Fortune of finding some of my <HI>Friends</HI> at home, who received me with prodigious Affability; and after desiring mine, and giving me their Opinion of the important Disputes concerning <HI>Elizabeth Canning</HI> and <HI>Mary Squires,</HI> dis∣missed me with great Politeness.</P>
<P>I was not a little fatigued with the successive Repeti∣tion of the same flimzy Chit-chat in every Company where I was admitted, and quite disgusted with so trifling a Manner of spending my Time, I was just going to direct the Coachman to drive home, when I recol∣lected, that I had not seen my Friend Mr. <HI>Discount</HI> of <HI>Cateaton-street,</HI> since the Lord Mayor's Day.</P>
<P>This determined me to steer my Course towards the City, and my good Genius prevailed so far, that I found Mr. <HI>Discount,</HI> his Lady and two Daughters, at home; it being the Day, upon which Mrs. <HI>Discount</HI> saw Company.</P>
<P>As soon as I entered the Room, my old Acquaint∣ance saluted me in a friendly Manner, and assured me, that he was glad to see me; his Lady, in an ironical Compliment, delivered with a forced Smile, gave me to understand, that she was highly sensible of the Ho∣nour I did her Family, in condescending to come into the City; and the young Ladiès curtesied, and told me, with some Appearance of Resentment, that they were extremely glad to find, that Mr. <HI>Ranger</HI> had not entirely forgot his old Friends.</P>
<P>This Reception somewhat disconcerted me; however, I endeavoured to acquit myself with the usual Compli∣ments, such as—<HI>That I had the greatest Esteem for Mr.</HI> Discount<HI>'s Family—That Nobody respected them more—But that Affairs of Business had engrossed my Time—That I seldom could command an Hour to my∣self
<PB N="217" REF="228"/>—But that I certainly should not be so had a Visiter for the futurs.</HI>—As soon as this preliminary Point was settled, Mr. <HI>Discount</HI> seated me next himself, and turn∣ing about, asked me, <Q>How Things went at our End of the Town?</Q>—<Q>What, says he, shall we have a Lottery, do you think?</Q> I was going to answer, that I really was not in the Secret of those Schemes, when the eldest Miss <HI>Discount</HI> interposed, and said, <Q>Lord! Papa, do you imagine, that Mr. <HI>Ranger</HI> trou∣bles himself about the Things you talk of in your City Coffee-houses? What are your Money-Affairs to him?—Have you been at a great many Plays last Winter, Mr. <HI>Ranger?</HI>—What do you think of <HI>Foote</HI>'s Farce? I saw it the first Night—I would not miss it the first Night for any Thing.</Q>—</P>
<P>As I was meditating an Answer, my worthy Friend takes me by the Hand, and exclaims—<Q>Heavens! Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> what will this World come to! The young People of this Age, Sir, think of nothing but Diversions — From Morning to Night, my Ears, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> are dinned with <HI>Garrick</HI> and <HI>Barry,</HI> and Dogs and Monkeys, and <HI>Mother Midnight,</HI> and <HI>Spoona∣tissimo,</HI> and such a Jargon, that one would imagine the Order of Things was inverted</Q> — Here the youngest Miss <HI>Discount</HI> seized the Conversation — <Q>Nay, now, Papa, says she, because you do not go to those Places yourself, you would not have any Body else go</Q>—<Q>That's true <HI>Betty,</HI> replied Mamma: He is a strange Man, to be sure — Mr. <HI>Discount</HI> has no Notion of any Thing genteel — Well, he must have his own Way.</Q> —</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Discount,</HI> without taking Notice of these Inter∣raptions, resumed his Discourse—<Q>Why, Sir, says he, this must portend something—Certainly a Judgment hangs over the Nation—We shall un∣doubtedly have another Earthquake at least—You know, the last Earthquake was occasioned by the
<PB N="218" REF="229"/>immense Number of Places of public Entertainment —the Bishop said so in his Letter—do you not remember it, Mr. <HI>Ranger?</HI></Q>—Here a loud Laugh made it unnecessary for me to reply, and my well∣meaning Friend, intent upon his Subject, continued to animadvert on the Extravagance of the Times— <Q>Your Uncle <HI>Caleb,</HI> added he, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> and I used frequently to talk over these Things together, and we have often lamented the Degeneracy of the Times —We foresaw, that it must end in the Ruin of the Nation — Ay, we foresaw it a long Time ago— All this Luxury, which has been the Bane of <HI>Old Eng∣land,</HI> has crept in among us since the Year Twenty. —Ah! that Year Twenty, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> was a fatal Year—a fatal Year indeed.</Q>—Here Miss <HI>Discount</HI> could contain no longer, but broke out, with some Warmth—<Q>Lord, Papa! You are always bringing up that Year Twenty—How many Hundred Years ago is it, since that Year Twenty?—It does not signify talking—While People are in the World, they must do as other People do, or they had better be out of the World; and one must go to public Places, or they will have nothing to talk of—Is it not so, Mr. <HI>Ranger?</HI> Come, now, I am sure you are of my Opinion, an't you?</Q>—As I was unwilling to disoblige either Party in this Dispute, I replied to the Lady in two Lines of <HI>Prior;</HI>
<Q><L>Seldom your Opinions err,</L>
<L>Your Eyes are always in the right.</L></Q> This Topic had, I thought, been pursued rather too far, therefore, I waved the Conversation, and asked the Ladies, whether they had seen Mrs. <HI>Brillant,</HI> since her Marriage? To this they all answered at once, O yes—Whereupon I took the Liberty to address my∣self particularly to Mrs. <HI>Discount,</HI> and desired to know,
<PB N="219" REF="230"/>whether she did not think her a very fine Woman?— <Q>A fine Woman, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> replied she, how can you ask me such a Question? To be sure, she is a showy Woman, and such a one as takes with the Men; but you can't call her a fine Woman surely. —Then, she wears her Cap so horridly; and al∣ways overdresses herself—The Gentlemen, I know, admire her, but I protest I cannot see for what."— Madam, replied I, I must beg Leave to be of a dif∣ferent Opinion; in my Eyes, Mrs. <HI>Brillant</HI> appears a very amiable Woman, and it gives me a great deal of Pleasure, that she is so happily married."— O indeed, says Miss <HI>Discount,</HI> I believe she is very happy, for she has a very handsome Equipage, and a sweet Pair of Ear-rings; and then she sees a vast deal of Company—There were ninety Persons at her last Rout—She plays Crown-Whist</Q>—</P>
<P>I could not forbear observing, that I was a little sur∣prized, so discerning a young Lady should estimate Mrs. <HI>Brillant</HI>'s Happiness from the Stake she played for at Whist, when to me it appeared, that she possessed a a more certain Source of Felicity, in the amiable Qua∣lities and polite Accomplishments of her Husband— <Q>O law! that's true, replied the Ladies, they say her Husband too is a <HI>pretty Man.</HI></Q></P>
<P>We were proceeding farther on this Head, when a thundering Rap was given at the Door, and the Ser∣vant signified, that Lady <HI>Portsoken</HI> was coming into the Room. As I thought I had paid a Visit of a sufficient Length, I took Advantage of the Alarm given by this City Knight's Lady, and withdrew unnoticed.</P>
<P>In my return Home, I could not avoid reflecting on the capricious Notions the female World entertain of Happiness.</P>
<P>To be dressed as well as others of the same Rank; to be present at all public Places, without considering the Entertainment in any other Light, than as the Means
<PB N="220" REF="231"/>of bringing Company together; to visit, and be visited by every one, whom they think it of Consequence to salute at the Playhouse; to live (if it may be called liv∣ing) in a perpetual Course of Card-playing; and, to sum up the whole, to be married to a Man of any Age, Figure or Qualities whatsoever, capable and willing to support all this, in the Opinion of Ninety-nine Females in a Hundred, constitutes a happy Woman. I should be perhaps censured as a Pedant, if I offended the De∣licacy of my female Readers, with observing, that they degrade the Faculties of the human Soul, by confining the Exercise of them within such a Circle of Trifles; but I hope I may be allowed Leave to refer them to the <HI>Spectator,</HI> where they will learn from the elegant Mr. <HI>Addison,</HI> that the strongest Argument, which can be advanced for the Immortality of the Soul, is, the con∣tinual Progress of the Mind in the Acquisition of Know∣ledge.</P>
<P>Now, I would submit it to the Candor of my fair Countrywomen, whether their Conduct does not subvert the Principles, upon which this polite Philosopher Reasons; and tend to establish the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Doc∣trine, that the Souls of Women are mortal.</P>
<P>Should this <HI>Turkish</HI> Tenet ever prevail among us, dreadful will be the Consequences. How will it be pos∣sible for an <HI>English</HI> Lady to content herself with the fourth Part of a Husband? And what a melancholy Transition will it be, from the Liberties at present in∣dalged to <HI>British</HI> Wives, to the Confinement and Hor∣rors of a Seraglio?—</P>
<P>I could add much more on this Subject, but I am aware, that my pretty Readers are prepared with a con∣clusive Answer to whatever can be advanced—<HI>Well; you may say what you will, but People will do as they like, for all that</HI>—The Force of which I readily acknow∣ledge, and, as becomes me, lay by the Pen.</P>

<BIBL><HI>VIRG:</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> HAVE of late received several very ur∣gent Letters from my Correspondents, in which they strenuously press me into the Service of my Country; and though I have always disclaimed Politics, as a Subject averse from my Inclinations, these Gentlemen are for making a States∣man of me in my own Despite. I must own, I am not willing to be thrown off my Byass, but when the Act of Parliament in favour of the <HI>Jews</HI> engrosses so much of our Conversation, and has worked all our Spi∣rits into a Ferment, it then becomes the Duty of a Pub∣lick Writer, to make his Bow to the Muses, and devote one Lucubration to the Happiness and Welfare of his Countrymen.</P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> have naturally interwoven in their Con∣stitution a peculiar Kind of national Self-Love, and the least Attempt to dispense a Favour to Foreigners a∣larms their Fears, and awakens that Jealousy which is natural to their very Frame. It is to this we owe the general Discontent, which has broke out among all Ranks of People upon the late Occasion; but that it is owing to a mistaken Prejudice, I believe, will be manifest to any Man that does not see Things with the Jaundiced Fye of Party.</P>
<P>It has been said, that by this Act we give the Lie to the Scripture, and fly in the Face of a peremptory Pro∣phecy,
<PB N="223" REF="234"/>which declares, that the <HI>Jews</HI> should be with∣out a fixed Scttlement in any Country, a vagabond Race upon the Face of the Earth. There was a Time when this Objection might be allowed to carry with it some Degree of Weight; while Christianity subsisted in this Kingdom, it would have been the grossest Absurdity to introduce a Bill of this Nature.</P>
<P>But the Christian Dispensation has entirely disap∣peared from among us, and I believe, in the Memory of the oldest Person now living no Trace of it can be found; which is, in my Opinion, a conclusive Argu∣ment in Favour of this Naturalization Act. Were it any Way inconsistent with the Religion now in Fashion, I persuade myself, it would have met with Opposition from a certain Bench in the H — of L —; but as nothing of this Kind was offered, it is to be presumed, that Judaism properly coincides with our present Dis∣position both in Church and State; and I would there∣fore recommend this Doctrine to be preached from the Pulpit, for the better quieting the Minds of Men; and if the Right Reverends would issue out Pastoral Let∣ters to this Purpose, the Remedy would be quicker in its Operation, and the mistaken Notions, which the common People have imbibed, would the sooner be effaced.</P>
<P>About three Weeks since I had Occasion to take a Boat at <HI>Whitehall</HI> Stairs, in order to go a little Way down the River. We no sooner put off from Shore, than I perceived the Waterman to be a very sensible Fellow, and particularly knowing in Politics. I there∣fore gave him an Opportunity of discovering his Senti∣ments on the Bill in Question, and he discussed it with great Strength of Lungs, and Vehemence of Observa∣tion, <Q>D—mn the circumcised Dogs, says he, now they are naturalized, I'll engage we shall have them all turn Watermen, and they will have all the Business of the River to themselves.</Q>—This Story (which
<PB N="224" REF="235"/>is really a Matter of Fact) will shew what Prejudices are entertained by the common People, who have raised the violent Clamour against the <HI>Israelites</HI> on this Occa∣sion; and hence may be inferred that Wisdom doth not always cry out in the Streets. For my Part, I am persuaded, when Things are considered dispassionately, the Act will bear a different Aspect in the Eyes of all Men of Sense. For who have been served by it? Not the poor <HI>Jews,</HI> who are still lest under the Severity de∣nounced against them, but the rich, who are by this Stroke rescued from Heaven's Vengeance; and this Regard to the Affluent, and Contempt for the Money∣less, I take to be perfectly consistent with the Genius of a trading Nation; and I am of Opinion that from this Incident, a very useful Moral may be enforced, <HI>viz.</HI> that Money cannot only influence sublunary Things, but also supersede the Decrees of Providence; and as I think this Act has given the Nation in general a very great Accession of Credit, Reputation, Honour, and Riches, I should be glad to see a further Step taken, in order to render the Work complete. I have not had Time to digest my Thoughts into a regular Scheme, and shall therefore content myself to suggest a few Hints, which may be improved at Maturity.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> As it is apparent from what has been ob∣served already, that the Christian Religion has no longer a Footing in this Country, it may not be improper to repeal the sacramental Test, and to substitute in its Room the Act of Circumcision; for which Purpose pro∣per Circumcisers may be found in <HI>Duke's-Place,</HI> who shall perform the Operation upon all our Placemen; and a proper Number may be chosen out of a certain venerable Body, in the Nature of a Jury of Matrons, to examine whether the Person be qualified according to Law.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> As the <HI>Jews</HI> are known to be possessed of over-grown Riches, and as no Lottery can be vigorously carried on without their Concurrence, whenever Sir
<PB N="225" REF="236"/><HI>John Barnard,</HI> or any Patriot inclinable to Christianity, shall devise a Scheme to prevent Impositions from Stock-Jobbers, it will be adviseable to let nobody into the Subscription but the above-mentioned <HI>Jews,</HI> who certainly cannot grow too rich, as our Regard for them will increase in Proportion to their Pelf.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> I am of Opinion, that it is prejudicial to this Kingdom to exclude the said <HI>Jews</HI> from Employments Civil and Military, because, as they have no other Coun∣try of their own, it is highly probable, that they will love <HI>England,</HI> (or <HI>Judaea Nova</HI>) with an Excess of Zeal; and if they were appointed to supply our Army and Navy with Provisions upon all Emergencies, it will cer∣tainly be perfectly agreeable to the Taste of our Sol∣diery and our Mariners to be fed with Beef cured by a <HI>Jew</HI> Butcher. Aboard the Fleet particularly, it will in∣fallibly be pleasing to have a Mess of Beef with a Label of stamped Lead upon it, to convince the Men that it has been duly cured. And further, instead of making Men of Merit Knights of the <HI>Bath,</HI> or promoting them to such like Honours, suppose they were to be distinguished (<HI>Secundum ordinem Melchizedec,</HI>) by the Or∣der of <HI>Melchizedec,</HI> it would not be an improper Institu∣tion. But this I submit to better Judgments.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly</HI> and <HI>Lastly,</HI>— I humbly propose, that an Army may be speedily raised for the Retaking <HI>Jerusa∣lem,</HI> which happy Event would enable our good Friends and now Countrymen the <HI>Israelites,</HI> to rebuild their Temple; by which Means they would entirely over∣turn the only Obstacle which now remains, towards dissipating those Errors, which have misguided People these seventeen Hundred fifty three Years past. And I hope, the bad Success of that great Man <HI>Julian the Apo∣state,</HI> who was defeated, by the Interposition of Heaven, in an Attempt of this Kind, will be no Discourage∣ment.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HERE is nothing more common than to hear it decisively pronounced in Conversa∣tion, that Mr. <HI>Such-a-one</HI> is a Man of very good Sense; or, on the Reverse, that he has not common Sense; and yet, notwithstanding the frequent Usage of this Phrase, I will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e upon me to say, there is not a Term in the <HI>English</HI> Language so little understood, or made use of in so many vague-Sig∣nifications. The Cause of this Variety of Conception is to be imputed to the various Lot of human Life, in which most People derive their Stock of Ideas from the Occupation they have been accidentally thrown into; from whence they acquire such confined Habits of thinking, that they have no Power of Reflection out of the beaten Path, and most Things are by them deter∣mined,
<PB N="228" REF="239"/>according to their partial Survey of Men and Manners.</P>
<P>I have somewhere read of a People residing in a small Town, situate in the Midst of the <HI>Alps,</HI> with whom the principal Constituent of Beauty is a swelling Prominence of Flesh in the Throat, by them called a <HI>Gother;</HI> and it is recorded, that, when when an <HI>English</HI> Gentleman, remarkable for all the Graces of manly Beauty, was passing by on his Travels to <HI>Italy,</HI> these Virtuosos observed, that he was of an elegant Form, and would really be very handsome, if had but a <HI>Gother.</HI> In like Manner, we daily meet with as notable Opinions relating to the Intellects of our Neighbours. I remem∣ber myself to have heard a Person of excellent Parts condemned for a Blockhead, because he never won an odd Trick at Whist; and I have known another ac∣counted a Man of the best Sense in <HI>England,</HI> because he was a great Dab at the Multipllcation Table, and had got over <HI>Euclid's Pons Asinorum.</HI> A Knack of Rhyming hath given an Air of Importance to a Verse maker, and the Acquirement of a Fortune is a Rule from which there can be no Appeal. Some Degree of Luck in this Way is sufficent to dub any one, SENSIBLE, WITTY, POLITE, GOOD-NATURED, and what not? Riches be∣ing in this Instance like Tar-water, not only serving as an excellent Alterative against all noxious Particles in the Constitution, but also conferring every good Qua∣lity under the Sun. It is to this Principle that we owe the EMINENT Cheesemonger, the EMINENT Tallow-Chandler, the EMINENT Haberdasher of Small-ware, the EMINENT Needlemaker, the EMINENT Pawnbroker, and a thousand other Degrees of EMINENCE, which it would be too tedious to enumerate at present.</P>
<P>There is a Passage in the Characters of the famous <HI>La Bruyere,</HI> which it may not be improper to cite on the present Occasion. <Q>FAUSTE <HI>est un dissolu, un prodigue, un libertin, un ingrat, un emporté, qu'</HI>AURELE <HI>son oncle
<PB N="229" REF="240"/>n'a pu hair ni desheriter.</HI> FRONTIN, <HI>neveu d'</HI>AURELE, <HI>après vingt aitnées d'une probité connue, &amp; d'une complai∣sance aveugle pour ce vieillard, ne l'a pu flechir en sa faveur; &amp; ne tire de sa depouille qu'une legere Pension, que</HI> FAUSTE <HI>unique legataire lui doit payer.</HI>" "<HI>Faustus,</HI> says the great Writer just mentioned, is dissolute in his Man∣ners, profuse in his Expences, a Libertine, an Ingrate, a Slave to his Passions, and yet his Uncle <HI>Aurelius</HI> could never conceive a Dislike to him, nor disinherit him in his Will. <HI>Frontinus,</HI> Nephew to <HI>Aurelius,</HI> has given Proofs of his Probity and respectful Attention to the old Gentleman, during a Series of twenty Years, and yet never could impress upon his Mind one Sen∣timent in his Favour; and now he lives upon a scanty Annuity, which is paid to him by <HI>Fausius,</HI> sole Le∣gatee to <HI>Aurelius.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This Extract, I apprehend, may serve to convince the Reader, that Fortune is but an erroneous Rule, by which to judge of a Character. As I conceive it, the Term <HI>Sense</HI> is derived from the Organs of bodily Sensation, which, when in due Order, give to the Mind an immediate Information of the Qualities in∣herent in natural Bodies; from thence the Phrase is transsferred to the human Mind, and denotes a quick Power of Perception in the Understanding upon all Oc∣currences in Life. Were I to define a Man of Sense, I should call him a Person of clear Apprehension and sound Judgment; Talents, which a small Degree of Observation will convince us, many are possessed of, though they do not upon all Occasions avail themselves of them; but, on the contrary, let them lie dormant in their Minds, without calling them forth into Action. The late Sir <HI>Richard Steel,</HI> I believe, may be allowed to have enjoyed as strong Intellectuals as any Cit what∣ever, and yet in pecuniary Matters his Conduct was highly negligent. It is said of this Gentleman, that going one Day into his Chariot, with an intimate
<PB N="230" REF="241"/>Friend, whom he had invited to his Country-House, as he passed through a Lane of his Servants, who had drawn themselves up in the Hall, the humorous Knight, looking over his Shoulder at his Acquaintance, plea∣santly repeated from <HI>Horace,</HI>
<Q><HI>Mancipiis locuples eget aeris Cappadocum Rex.</HI></Q>
<Q>The King of <HI>Cappadocia</HI> is well provided with Ser∣vants, but wants Money.</Q> From this it will appear, what Degree of Regard that Genius had for yellow Dirt, which, though a Necessary of Life, is certainly incapable of conferring one single Accomplishment either to the Head or Heart, and is generally the Acquisition of the Dullest of human Race.</P>
<P>Certain it is, that to create a Fortune in the ordinary Paths of Business, is so far from requiring Wit, Genius, Learning, Imagination, Invention, or any liberal Fa∣culty, that every one of those Attributes have rather a Tendency to keep the Possessor of them still the poorer, "as Heaven's blest Beams turns Vinegar more sour." An eager Love of Pelf, a narrow Attention to what is called the main Chance, a Spice of that Clergyman's Way of thinking who delivered in his Sermon that "a Shilling is a serious Thing," and a cold, languid, unimpassioned Temper, are the principal Ingredients in the Composition of the Man of Business; while Per∣sons of quick Understanding will always have lively Sensations, which must, at Times, hurry them in∣to Scenes of Action astonishing to the sober Shop∣keeper, or the sedate Book-keeper; but it should be remembered, that Passions are the Gales of Life, and that to be divested of them, is so far from denoting a sensible Mind, that it is a Proof of lamentable Dullness
<PB N="231" REF="242"/>and Stupidity. I shall conclude this Paper with two short Characters drawn from real Life.</P>
<P><HI>Avarus</HI> was bound to a Trade at fourteen. Years of Age; he cleaned his Master's Shoes, laid under the Counter, swept the Shop, scraped the Threshold, mount∣ed on the Leads to clean the Gutter, went regularly to the Post-Office with Letters, was perfectly well versed in the Rule of Three, and had the Merchant's Direc∣tory by Heart. On <HI>Sundays</HI> he would take a sober Walk to <HI>Islington, Newington, Paddington,</HI> &amp;c. and, when a Frolic seized him, he would, in the Fulness of his Soul, spend his Threepence at <HI>Jenny</HI>'s <HI>Whim.</HI> As he grew up, he became a downright <HI>Stoic</HI> in the Government of his Passions, to such a Degree, that he was thought at length totally to have extinguished them all, except his darling Love of Money, which has never ceased to influence his Thoughts. In short, <HI>Avarus</HI> has been so attentive to the main Chance, that he is now flourishing and starving with a large Fortune; is determined to sell his Vote at the next Election, and is likely in Time to be made Sheriff of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Liberalis</HI> was bred at <HI>Westminster</HI> School, where he was always famous for a keen Turn at an Epigram, and, when removed to the University, he was thought to have car∣ried with him a great Knowledge of <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin.</HI> While at <HI>Oxford</HI> he enlarged his Mind with useful Stu∣dies, and cultivated a just and elegant Taste for all po∣lite Literature. Being turned of One and twenty, he entered himself in the <HI>Temple,</HI> where he read the Law with sufficient Application; but, in order to unbend his Mind, he was frequently found dipping into <HI>Shake∣spear;</HI> and it has been said by his Enemies, that he never would entirely divest himself of an Attachment to the <HI>Belles Lettres.</HI> I have somewhere seen it remarked, that a Taste in Reading is apt to infuse the same in Morals; which Observation proved fatally true to <HI>Liberalis,</HI> and in Consequence of this Turn of Mind, he could never
<PB N="232" REF="243"/>prevail on himself to fall into any mean Practices, by which Conduct he soon found himself deserted by his Clients, and neglected by the Attorneys; and he now remains unsought in his Chambers, in the high Road to Poverty; in which, agreeably to the Way of the World, we will leave him to himself, and lay down the Pen.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">U</SEG>PON going into the <HI>Bedford</HI> Coffee-house a few Days since, I found my Friend <HI>Wild∣air</HI> in a Circle of his Acquaintance; he was talking over the several Occurrences he had met with in his Rambles after Intelligence that Day; and, as he has a peculiar Dexterity in dressing up a Story in all its most striking Colours, without falling into a tedious minute Detail of trivial Circum∣stances, he touched upon many Incidents in a Manner so diverting, that he excited a general Mirth in the little Audience that was gathered round him. <HI>Wildair,</HI> to speak the Truth, has something extremely captivating in his Conversation, and is, of all the Men I know, the best turned for Society. Though a Fellow of Parts, he has never suffered his Spirits to subside into a se∣rious Habit of thinking, but, in a superficial Way, glides over every Thing that offers in Company; no Subject comes amiss to him, and be it what it will, he has al∣ways something to say for himself; which Circumstance, joined to a sprightly Delivery, contributes greatly to enliven his Company. He frequently rallies a Gentle∣man of our intimate Acquaintance on this Head, and will tell him frankly, <Q>I know, <HI>Jack,</HI> you are a sen∣sible Fellow in the main, but as you manage Mat∣ters, your Friends must study hard to find it out;—
<PB N="234" REF="245"/>take my Word for it, the World is very superficial, and a Facility of dismissing every Subject in a brisk Manner, will make a Person pass for a Knowing one, at the same Time that it renders him sociable, and of course agreeable.</Q></P>
<P>This is my worthy Friend <HI>Wildair</HI>'s Way of thinking, and upon this Plan he acquits himself so well, that he is extremely sought by his Acquaintance, and when∣ever they lay hold of him, it is difficult for him to elude their Solicitations for a Party of Pleasure. This was the Case with him the other Night, and as I was pay∣ing my Debt at the Bar, he made up to me, and with a Whisper told me, That if I would make one of the Company, it would furnish me with Hints for some future Essay. In vain I reminded him that it was Club Night, and his Turn to possess the Chair; this Party, he assured me, would afford higher Entertain∣ment. I yielded to his Sollicitations, and I must say, that my Manner of spending the Evening has supplied me with Materials, the like of which never came in my Way before.</P>
<P>Before I proceed farther into the Business, it may not be improper, in Imitation of the Writers for the Stage, to give a Degree of Insight into the Characters of the <HI>Dramatis Personae.</HI> The Reader is already ac∣quainted with my Disposition and Way of thinking, and he also knows Mr. <HI>Wildair.</HI> The rest of the Com∣pany consisted of a MAN OF WIT, a MAN OF HUMOUR, a DAMN'D HONEST FELLOW, and a Person of a very elegant Appearance, a cool sedate Temper, and ex∣tremely decent and polite in his Deportment. With this Set, I shifted the Scene from the <HI>Bedford</HI> to the <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s-<HI>Head,</HI> and upon entering the Tavern, the HONEST FELLOW alarmed the House, by calling for a Room with great Vociferation; which being shewed to us with the utmost Attention, he ordered a Brace of Bottles of the right Sort, immediately filled a Round
<PB N="235" REF="246"/>of Bumpers, and roared out, "Come let's be jolly, <HI>Ranger,</HI>"—"d—mn your musty Books"—<Q>let's sit down.</Q>—This I had no Objection to; but as I was attempting to do it, the MAN OF HUMOUR, with infinite Pleasantry, removed the Chair that was placed for me; the Consequence of which was, that, to the great Surprize of the whole Company, I was brought to the Ground. As I received a Contusion in the Fall, I could not entirely relish the Joke, but it gave infinite Satisfaction to almost all the rest, and they agreed, that it really was a very good Thing, as good a Thing as ever they had known: "Immense, by G—d," says the HONEST FELLOW, "a glorious Hum," says the WIT; while my humorous Friend, with a dry Composure of Countenance, denoting something between Jest and Earnest, begged my Pardon, and then officiously offered to settle my Wig; and this he did in such a facetious Po∣sition, and such a whimsical Stare of the Curls, that thence was deducible a new Flow of Mirth, which, amidst the Bursts of Joy that stunned my Ears, he enjoyed in a sober Manner, Humour being ever grave and sedate. <HI>Wildair</HI> perceiving by this Time, that I did not approve my Com∣pany, came over to me, and begged I would see it out, and squeezing my Hand, he added from <HI>Virgil,</HI>
<Q>Forsan &amp; haec olim meminisse juvabit.</Q></P>
<P>This had so much Prevalence with me, that I agreed, and the HONEST FELLOW shewed away egregiously. The Bottle went round at so brisk a Rate, that my Eyes began to dance in my Head like Wild-fire. By all that's Burgundy, says he, <Q><HI>Harris</HI> is the best Pimp in <HI>England,</HI>—Here Waiter, call <HI>Harris (Enter Harris) —Harris,</HI> d—mn your old Soul, get us a fine Girl"—"There's a fine Girl please your Honour at a Place I know,—no body has seen her but <HI>Lord Shallow,</HI> and myself—and there's <HI>Betty Connor,</HI>
<PB N="236" REF="247"/>just arrived from <HI>Dublin</HI>—'Squire <HI>M'Hazard</HI> brought her with him; she has fine Flesh and Blood, please your Honour,—most of the <HI>Irish</HI> Wenches have, please your Honour,—and if your Honour chuses it, I fancy I have a Bait will bring her out.</Q>— This Proposal was universally received, and in a short Time the Lady was ushered into the Room, not with∣out some Glances mutually interchanged between her and <HI>Harris.</HI></P>
<P>The MAN OF HUMOUR and the WIT immediately began to play her off, as they called it—But, as it is a Rule among good Writers, never to enlarge too much upon any Subject, and to leave something for the Imagination of the Reader to supply, I shall upon this Occasion conform to the Precept; and will only add, that the Lady, in the Space of about half an Hour, drank and sung, and laughed and cried, and danced and sat, and talked and said nothing, with the most sur∣prizing Quickness in the Vicissitude, till at length, the HONEST FELLOW swore that she spoiled good Fellow∣ship, and-abruptly desired her to take half a Guinea at the Bar and withdraw, which Madam performed after several Te hes and Titters.</P>
<P>This Matter being settled, we were suddenly surprized with the most enlivening Melody, accompanied by a sprightly Voice, that plainly and musically articulated, <HI>Non, toujours dire non, &amp;c.</HI> It seems, one of those fair Natives of <HI>Savoy,</HI> who are good-natured enough to un∣dergo the Fatigue of a long Journey, in order to make our Public Streets harmonious, was placed in the Yard, with private Instructions to entertain us with the vocal and instrumental Strain. By this our Spirits received a fresh Reinforcement, and the MAN OF WIT immediately threw his Wig out of the Window, bounced over the Table, broke several Bottles and Glasses, and alarmed me with a most intolerable Rap on the Shoulders. The
<PB N="237" REF="248"/>MAN OF HUMOUR expressed his Approbation with a dry Joke; the HONEST FELLOW pushed the <HI>Burgundy</HI> about, and the decent Gentleman, whom the Reader will recollect I mentioned in the Beginning of this Paper, smiled with the most winning Complacence. This Personage has hitherto made no Figure in this <HI>Symposium;</HI> the Fact is, he did not drink above six Glasses of Wine during the whole Night; but now his Heart seemed to dilate, his Eyes sparkled with the most vivid Lustre, and in the Chearfulness of his Soul, he held out his Fist to the Company, and, <Q>Come, says he, Odd or Even for this little Silver.</Q> The Spirits of almost every one present were ready to flow into any Channel, and Gaming became the general Amusement. Cards were immediately rung for to play at Brag, and after a few Rounds, the ELEGANT POLITE MAN pro∣duced a Box and Dice out of his Pocket, and I believe he will hardly forgive me for desiring a Bill at Five in the Morning, as he was in a tolerable Run, and had picked up about seventy Pounds. However, with some Reluctance, he condescended to collect the Reckon∣ing, which, as soon as every Body paid his Proportion, he carefully put into his Pocket, and desired his Friend <HI>Tomkyns</HI> to place the whole to his Account.</P>
<P>This being adjusted, in order to compleat this Even∣ing the MAN OF HUMOUR proposed a Scheme, which, he said, would afford more Pleasantry than he had ever known. <Q>It-is, says he, the luckiest Thought in the World—a better—ne—never—enter —ed—into a—Man's—He—ad—let us tofs up, who shall—be—th—thrown—out of—the Window, for the frol—frolick sake.</Q>—I was very much averse from this Piece of Merriment, but being over-ruled by the Company, it was immediately done, and the Lot fell to my Friend <HI>Wildair,</HI> who was instantly surrounded, and the HONEST FELLOW opened the Window, not without violent Roaring, while the
<PB N="238" REF="249"/>DECENT MAN still continued at the Table, throwing the Dice, and saying to himself, "Seven's the Main." I really believe, the Coroner's Inquest would have sat on <HI>Wildair</HI>'s Body at Ten o'Clock in the Morning, had not the timely Interposition of sober Entreaty begged him off.</P>
<P>Upon this I made my Escape, and I do not know when I spent an Evening in a Manner that has given me such Reflections. The MAN OF WIT, I suppose, has acquired his Notions of Things from Sir <HI>Richard Blackmore,</HI> who tells us, that Wit consists in regular and exalted Ferments; or from Mr. <HI>Dennis,</HI> who defines it, a Motion of furious Joy and Pride of Soul upon Con∣ception of an Hint; for indeed, this Gentleman has certainly very exalted Ferments, and most surprizing Motions upon the Conception of his Hints. I shall take Occasion in some ensuing Essay, to undeceive him, by giving the Ideas I have formed to myself of the Talent he professes; and in my next Lucubration I shall endeavour to convince the MAN OF HUMOUR, that he is wide of the Character he would be thought to possess. As HUMOUR is a Subject of some Diffi∣culty, I shall endeavour to treat it with Perspicuity, and I beforehand beg some Mercy of the Critics.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T has been long since recommended to the Tribe of Criticks, to adjust and settle their Ideas, in a clear and regular Order, by fixing the distinct Meaning annexed to each Term they make use of in conveying their Re∣marks. If this Advice was properly adhered to, it would cut Matters very short in all Debates, which arise upon Points of Literature; and would enable those, who aspire to the Province of Criticism, to pass their Judgment with Precision. But the Reverse of this is fre∣quently the Case, and I shall at present single out two Expressions, from a Multitude of others, which appear to me to be used in a vague, random Manner, the determinate Meaning of either not being sufficiently ascertained.</P>
<P>The Terms, I mean, are an HUMOURIST and a MAN OF HUMOUR. They are thought, by what I find, synonymous by many People, which must be the Source of numberless Mistakes. To define each, may be, perhaps, Matter of some Difficulty; but if I un∣derstand them right, the Reader is welcome to what Light I can give him into the Matter.</P>
<P>An HUMOURIST, I take to be, one under the In∣fluence of some remarkable Oddity, or unaccountable Whim, which has taken such strong Possession of the
<PB N="241" REF="252"/>Mind, and has so insinuated itself into all its Ope∣rations, that it mixes with the common Train of his Ideas, and thereby gives such a Cast to his Way of thinking, that every Thing strikes him in a different Light from the rest of his Fellow-Creatures, and of Consequence, every Thing he does, is also in an ex∣travagant Manner.</P>
<P>I have not been able to investigate, in any Historian, the first Appearance of this Species of Men in this King∣dom. Whether it was in the Nature of the <HI>Aborigines,</HI> or first Inhabitants of this Island; or whether it made its Inroad among us, with that general Conflux of dif∣ferent Nations, which landed here, is a Point not very easy to determine. One Thing is clear, that they are of a long Standing among us, and indeed they thrive with such large Increase in this our Soil, that there is room to apprehend, the whole Nation will shortly be∣come a Nation of odd Fellows.</P>
<P>Besides the many Extravagancies, which this Set of Men are addicted to, they have all a strange Notion, that they must have their own Way. Mr. <HI>Congreve</HI> has observed, that there is a Proverb by which they are, in a great Measure, governed. <HI>He that will have a May-pole, shall have a May-pole.</HI> They are entirely attached to the Gratification of their own particular Bent; their Imaginations have contracted such whimsi∣cal Habits, that they see Things through a Medium, to which Men of a more reasonable Turn, are Stran∣gers; and thence it results, that wild and fantastick Opinions are delivered upon all Topics, and their Con∣duct is nothing but a Series of Inconsistencies.</P>
<P>The Person, who falls into this Way of thinking, is properly speaking an HUMOURIST, and <HI>Quidquid vult, valde vult,</HI> should be the Motto of every one of them; they being all inflexible in Pursuit of their Inclinations. It is a trite Remark, that the Spirit of Liberty and In∣dependency, which is diffused throughout this Kingdom,
<PB N="242" REF="253"/>contrioutes very much to feed this odd Turn, and to promote its Growth. I have mixed frequently in the Meetings of <HI>Humourists,</HI> in order to animadvert upon their Ways; and have always observed, that none of them will suffer themselves to be controuled, for this exceilent Reason; because, <Q>D—mn my Blood, I can club my Reckoning as well as any Man, and I have been an House-keeper, Man and Boy these thirty or forty Years; and I pay my Rent, and so a Fig for King <HI>G</HI>—.</Q>—Thus, while the HUMOURIST has his Property secured to him, by the salutary Laws of our noble Constitution, he will enjoy his Independency; to give a Proof of which, he thinks it essential to have a Value for no Man; and to please himself, though at the Expence of his Company, is his darling Delight.</P>
<P>It is to the Observation of these Oddities, that we owe the MAN OF HUMOUR; and hence is deducible a Definition, or rather Description of his Character. He is one who <HI>Eyes Natures Walks,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> sinely phrases it, and <HI>catches the Manners living, as they rise.</HI> He sees the Pololes, which have taken Root in the Man, and the many motly Circumstances, which adhere to him. He looks, as it were, into his very mind, per∣ceives there the Jaundice, through which every Thing pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es; and from whence all Objects derive their Hue; he sees the Imagination tinged with this strange Dye, and all the Affections of the Soul discoloured by it. He views such Traces formed in his Brain, that it is ren∣dered quite different, from that of any other human Creature; and thus the MAN OF HUMOUR perceives the secret and internal Springs of Action, which lead on the HUMOURIST; he cannot help smiling to see the Operations of his Soul so extravagant, and be∣ing acquainted with the latent Cause of those odd Ap∣pearances which disclose themselves upon all Occasions, he afterwards represents them to the World in true and lively Colours.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="254"/>Thus may the two Characters in Question, be de∣scribed, though they have been so much mistaken by many People. The Confusion, I apprehend, is owing to the vague Use of the Word HUMOUR, which is pro∣miscuously applied to both. It is common to say of the HUMOURIST, he has his Humour, or it is his Humour, and of the humourous Man, we assert, that he has a great Fund of Humour. In both Cases, the Phrase car∣ries with ta different Sense, denoting in the former In∣stance, the Foible or Whim, which operates upon the Man's Conduct, and in the latter signifying that Plea∣santry, which represents the odd Fellow in a diverting Light. The Poverty of our Language has introduced this ambiguous Use of the Word, but if People would be carefur to acquire Perspicuity in their Ideas, and the Terms they express them by, it would prevent much Perplexity and Confusion.</P>
<P>For Instance, it would be absurd in any Critic, to call the inimitable Mr. <HI>Fielding</HI> an HUMOURIST, but he who would pronounce him to be a Man of exquisite Humour, would, I believe, express something more pertinent to the Point. In like Manner, Mr <HI>Hogarth</HI> has exhibited in his Pieces, with the most masterly Strokes of his Pencil, an whole Set of <HI>Humourists,</HI> and the ingenious Artist, who thus enchant our Eye, is un∣doubtedly a MAN OF HUMOUR.</P>
<P>There is another Cause, to which, in my Opinion, this Mistake has been greatly owing; it frequently hap∣pens, that a MAN OF HUMOUR, is at the same Time in some Measure, an HUMOURIST himself. These two Characters, thus blended together, have often a very happy Effect, and serve to heighten each other. This we Experience in <HI>Shaiespear</HI>'s <HI>Falstaff,</HI> in whom we find united in a pleasing Assemblage, the mixed Qua∣lities of these two different Characters. Sir <HI>John</HI>'s Love of Plunder, his Pretensions to Deeds of Hardiness; his Aversion to Cowards, and his moralizing on the Man∣ners
<PB N="244" REF="255"/>of the Age, cannot but appear whimsical, when we consider, that he is sitter to drink Sack and un∣button him after Dinner, than to attempt Feats of Prowess, that he is an accomplished Coward in his Heart, and that his Way of Life is quite abandoned and dissolute. These are the Circumstances, which de∣note him an odd Fellow, but his quick Perception of the Foibles of his Neighbours, and his Vivacity in ex∣hibiting them in a ridiculous Point of View, are the Qualities which constitute him a MAN OF HUMOUR. This last Circumstance, I apprehend, makes Sir <HI>John,</HI> a Favourite with every Body, and endears him to all the Sons of Merriment; and in this, if I mistake not, lies the chief Difference between <HI>Shakespear</HI> and <HI>Ben Johason.</HI> The Characters produced by the latter, are always disagreeably odd; their Whims are so ex∣travagant, that they sometimes deserve rather the Name of Madmen, and there is hardly any Thing in any of them, that would induce a Gentleman to spend an Even∣ing with them.</P>
<P>It requires a close Knowledge of the World, to ex∣hibit Personages of this Cast on the Stage. Every Idea that rises in the Mind of an odd Fellow, his va∣rious Ways of Thinking and Inconsistencies, must be the constant Object of the Poets Attention, and he must be careful to give to each his specific Language. The Player must not only be acquainted with the human Heart, and human Understanding; but he has also a farther Step to take. He must Watch the HUMOURIST in every Circumstance; his Manner of Delivery, his Tone of Voice, the Cast of his Eye, his every Gesture and Attitude must fall immediately under his Inspec∣tion; and to all this, he must add, the rare Talent of concealing his Art.</P>
<P>In this Point, I am apt to think, Mr. <HI>Woodward,</HI> ex∣cellent as he is, from an Over-warmth of Spirit, sometimes deficient. I would submit it to himself, whether his Feel∣ing
<PB N="245" REF="256"/>of the Whimsies of some Characters is not now and then too lively, and whether his Sensations do not carry him so far in some Passages, as to make it visible, that he is conscious of the Oddity of the Appearance, even while he is personating the Man?—His <HI>Bobadil</HI> is one of the Exceptions to this Remark, and his not permit∣ting his Fancy to run into Riots in that Part, has so sine an Effect, that I am persuaded, were healways equally upon his Guard, his greatest Enemy would have nothing to do but to admire him.</P>
<P>Whoever has seen Mrs. <HI>Pritchard</HI> in <HI>Beatrice,</HI> in <HI>Maria,</HI> in <HI>Clarinda,</HI> &amp;c. will recollect such lively and acknow∣ledged Touches of Nature as can hardly be equalled, unless the Pleasantry of Mrs. <HI>Clive</HI> in her very humourous Walk of Comedy, may be deemed to rival them.</P>
<P>I cannot conclude without Mention of Mr. <HI>Garrick,</HI> who is certainly admirable in every Species of acting. In Tragedy, his Power over the Passions is too well known, to be here insisted on, and in Comedy, every Thing is impressed by him on his Audience with the nicest Skill, and in such Parts as <HI>Benedict</HI> and Sir <HI>John Brute,</HI> he is at once an <HI>Humourist</HI> and a <HI>Man of Humour</HI> with the most diverting Pleasantry. I shall dismiss this Paper, after applying the Words of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> on this Occasion. "He is not more a Master of <Q>the <HI>great,</HI> than of the <HI>ridiculous</HI> in human Nature; of our noblest Tendernesses, than of our vainest Foibles; of our strongest Emotions, than of our idlest Sensations.</Q></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>F I remember right, you some Time since recommended the Maxim of an old <HI>Greek</HI> Philosopher, who lays it down as a Rule, that we should not suffer any Thing in Life to take too strong an Hold of our Imagination, because that Power of the Mind is found to have a very considerable Influence upon all our Sentiments and all our Actions. Certainly
<PB N="253" REF="264"/>when the Reins are thrown loose upon the Neck of un∣governed Fancy, we become instantly addicted to what is called in the common Phrase <HI>Castle-Building,</HI> than which there is not a more dangerous Exercise of our in∣tellectual Faculties. It is a continual roving of our Thoughts to ideal Scenes of Joy; Pleasure is our Pur∣suit, and when it does not appear within our Reach, we catch at the Shadow, instead of the Substance; we ramble into a kind of Fools Paradise, and lounge away our Hours in the imaginary Gardens of a dreaming <HI>Eficurus,</HI> from whence it results that the Sinews of the Understanding become relaxed; an enervating Stillness spreads over all the Powers of the Soul, which is con∣stantly dissolved in Luxury of its own Creation; fond Self-love holds up to us a pleasing Picture, throws some Joys into Perspective, flings what is disagree∣able into Shades, and totally hides from us the thorny Parts of the Landskip. These perhaps may be accounted Pleasures, but they are in the main like the visionary Ideas excited by taking <HI>Laudanum;</HI> at the same Time that they administer a Flow of Spirits, they invade our Nerves and render us entirely unfit for any Sphere of Action.</P>
<P>An Instance of this intoxicating Power of <HI>Castle-Building</HI> I have observed for some Time past in Mrs. <HI>Vainlove,</HI> who has spent the greatest Part of her Life in a waking Dream, and can hardly be accounted one of this World, as she has been, in the general, quite abstracted from Society, and has dwelt mostly in the airy Regions of Fancy. Mrs. <HI>Vainlove,</HI> in the greener Part of her Life, was flattered into a Notion of her own Beauty, by which Means she became fond of Power. Her Eyes, she thought gave her a <HI>Right divine</HI> to be a pretty Tyrant over the opposite Sex, and as the Ima∣gination never deals out Blessings with a scanty Hand, her Sway soon became in Appearance as extensive as her most delusive Hopes could desire. But though she
<PB N="254" REF="265"/>led the whole Race of Man in Captivity, she at length condescended to let an ambitious Lover aspire to her Bed. The Consequence of this Condescension was, that in due Course of Time she was the happy Mo∣ther of a fair Daughter, in whom she saw her own Fea∣tures, but moulded with greater Delicacy. Self-love inclined her to admire this flattering Likeness of herself, and the Emanations of Fancy bestowed upon her every Grace. Before Miss could walk, in the Mother's Eye she danced with all the Elegance of <HI>Auretti,</HI> and as soon as her Tongue began to utter imperfect Words; <Q>Lord what a deal of Wit the Child has? Dear Cou∣sin a'nt you astonished at her? 'pon Honour I never taught her that.</Q> In Process of Time Miss <HI>Vain∣love</HI> devoured up these Expressions of Admiration with a greedy Ear, and she began insensibly to believe every Word perfectly true, till at length her Imagination took the very same Turn which had distorted the Thoughts of her Mother before, and a Series of Years, instead of banishing the Deceit, but served to give a stronger Tincture to her Fancy.</P>
<P>When <HI>Virgil</HI>'s <HI>Dido</HI> is crossed in Love, and she finds herself upon the Point of being deserted by the <HI>Trojan</HI> Prince, her ready Fancy seizes the Occasion to disturb her with visionary Scenes of Solitude, in which she thinks herself abandoned and forlorn.</P>
<Q><L>—Semperque relinqui</L>
<L>Sola sibi, semper longam incomitata videtur</L>
<L>Ire Viam. —</L></Q>
<P>But with Miss <HI>Vainlove</HI> the Cafe is quite reversed; though it should happen that her Fate removes her from the dear Society of Man; though the sudden Ex∣crescence of a Pimple on her Face or Neck should doom her a Recluse, until her Skin regains its native Alabaster Smoothness; though an untractable Lock should refuse
<PB N="255" REF="266"/>to join in amicable Confederacy with the Rest of her Head-dress, and determine her in a Fit of Peevishness to sequester herself from the World, yet still she reigns Queen of the Assembly, and has a Circle of Beaux about her; the ideal Footman's Rap sounds Transport to her Ear, and she is every Instant receiving the Ho∣mage of contending Lovers, who have no Existence but in her own Brain. Her Mother confirms her in the Deception, and through the Force of Habit, they are constantly amused with Pictures of their own Creation; like those, who, Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> tells us in his Treatise on the <HI>Conduct of the Understanding,</HI> through some Distem∣perature in their Blood, or any other internal Cause, see a Variety of Colours passing continually before them, and frequently perceive a Groupe of human Fi∣gures, Soldiers and Combatants marching in Proces∣sion before the deluded Eye of distempered Fancy.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Vainlove</HI> has carried Matters to such an Extreme, that she really thinks herself the most celebrated Toast about Town at present; <HI>Ryan</HI> at the <HI>King's Arms</HI> is under infinite Obligations to her for the plentiful Libations of Burgundy, which have been poured out to her Beauty at his House; and almost all the Taverns in the Cities of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Westminster</HI> have felt in this Way, the happy Influence of her Beauty.</P>
<P>Her Footman has the best Place in <HI>England,</HI> because as she has taken it into her Head, he is in the constant Receipt of Bribes at all public Places, to induce him to tell the Name of his young Mistress, and the Place of her Abode. Madam <HI>La Place</HI> owes a great deal of her Success in Business to Miss <HI>Vainlove</HI>'s having the Lead of all the Fashions, and directing the Ladies of her Acquaintance to her Milliner, that they may set themselves off with the same Advantages of Orna∣ment.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Vainlove,</HI> without having one real Lover, has constantly a large Number of fancied Slaves to her
<PB N="256" REF="267"/>Frowns and Smiles, and from thence it happens, that she looks upon all the Women as a Set of Creatures that envy her, and the Men she considers as her Vo∣taries, fit for nothing but to grace her Triumph. There is nothing more common with her than to be within a few Days of being married to a Man of large Fortune, even when she never exchanged a Word with him. <Q>Well, to be sure, says she, it's surprizing how Things are whispered about; the common Report is, that I am to be married to Mr. <HI>What-do ye-call-him,</HI> with∣out Doubt it is in my Power.—but—Lord the whole Town has it.</Q> It is in vain to assure her that the Town does not trouble its Head about her; her Mo∣ther has told her she does not meet so fine a Wo∣man any where, and so the Opiate works. I met both these egregious Characters at <HI>Vauxhall</HI> a few Nights since, when they informed me, that the whole Set of foreign Ambassadors were now in the young Ladies Train, and that **** who is a Man of Con∣sequence and Forture in the Country, which he re∣presents, is absolutely expiring for Miss <HI>Vainlove.</HI> It happened, that after this I paid her several Visits, and never meeting any of her florid Retinue, I took the Liberty to mention that I never had the Pleasure of seeing her gay Set of Enamoratos; to this Mrs. <HI>Vain∣love</HI> replied, that she had given them their Answer, <Q>Whenever we give them their Answer, they never come again.</Q></P>
<P>Thus these two Ladies never see any Thing in its proper Colour; they think their Dreams Reali∣ties, and, like mad People, are constantly reasoning right from wrong Principles. Pray, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> mi∣nister to a Mind diseased, as <HI>Shakespear</HI> phrases it; let them know that they cannot subsist very long upon such airy Pleasures, as they imagine to themselves, and con∣vince them, that there is great Truth in what is said, perhaps too loosely by the comic Poet.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> HAVE lately done myself the Pleasure of perusing the several Performances in Criticism, with which <HI>Voltaire</HI> has in∣troduced into the World his various poeti∣cal Compositions. That excellent Author has the Modesty to call most of these short Essays, by the Name of, <HI>Fugitive Pieces of Literature.</HI> But the smallest Pro∣ductions of so pleasing a Writer, are indelible, and will be read with Pleasure, while there remains any Taste for a fine Turn of Sense and an elegant Felicity of Ex∣pression. When I observe thus much, I would not have it imagined that I perceive any Traces of Infallibility about him. In the general, his Remarks are deduced from Nature and <HI>Aristotle,</HI> and, on most Occasions, he delivers himself with a sound Judgment; but in my late cursory Review of his Writings, I think I have met with some Passages, which demand the Animadver∣sion of a Writer, who pretends to instruct or entertain his Readers. In the Discharge of this Task, I think I cannot acquit myself in a better Form, than that of a Letter to the Author; this I shall endeavour to do with that Politeness, which is due to such an extensive Ge∣nius,
<PB N="259" REF="270"/>and I make no Doubt but the <HI>English Reader</HI> will concur with me, in the few Observations, which I shall submit to his Perusal.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD><HI>To Monsieur</HI> VOLTAIRE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Republic of Letters has happily removed that aukward Distance, and that extreme Difficulty of Access, which Policy, ministerial Artifice, and insolent Pride have established in the ordinary Intercourse of Life; by which Means it has obtained, that the easy Seasons of Application, the <HI>mollia tempora fandi,</HI> are at all times allowed to every Member of the serene Re∣public already mentioned; and, while Decency and good Manners are preserved, an easy Habitude subsists between the highest and the lowest of that august Body. Freedom of Converse is the happy Collision, which has struck out so many new Lights in every Thing relating to the Sciences and the liberal Arts; and it has been observed that there is no Book so mean but some useful Hint may possibly be derived from it. On this Account it may be proper to wave all Offers at an Apology, for the Liberty an unknown Writer allows himself, in ad∣dressing a Letter to so enlightened a Genius; I shall only premise, on this Occasion, that I take the Pen in Hand with that Respect to which you are certainly en∣titled by the Superiority of your Parts; but as I have taken Exceptions to some Criticisms, scattered up and down in your Writings, I cannot suppress a very strong Inclination of making some Remarks upon them.</P>
<P>I have observed, Sir, that you are apt to reprobate the <HI>English</HI> Stage, with some Degree of Acrimony, whenever it comes in your Way, and that you have not hesitated to make free with our immortal <HI>Shakespear,</HI> after a Manner, which, in my Opinion, is inconsistent
<PB N="260" REF="271"/>with that Relish for manly Sense, which seems to be your Characteristic, and in a Stile, which to me ap∣pears destitute of your usual Delicacy. If I should say, that the boasted <HI>Bienséance</HI> of your Country has relin∣quished you in some of these Passages, I flatter myself that upon a Review of them, you will not totally disa∣vow it. The most striking of the various Judgments, which you have vented against the greatest Dramatic Genius in the World, is found in your Discourse pre∣fixed, to your Tragedy of <HI>Semiramis,</HI> and is literally translated into <HI>English</HI> as follows.</P>
<Q>I do not mean to justify the Tragedy of <HI>Hamlet</HI> in every Particular; it is in Fact a barbarous Piece, abounding with such gross Absurdities, that it would not be tolerated by the Vulgar in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy.</HI> The Hero of the Play runs mad in the second Act, and his Mistress meets with the same Misfortune in the third. The Prince takes <HI>Ophelia</HI>'s Father for a Rat, and kills him, and, in Despair, she throws her∣self into a River. Her Grave is dug on the Stage, and the Grave-Digger, with a Skull in his Hand, amuses himself with a String of miserable Jests, while the Prince answers them in Language equally dis∣gusting. <HI>Hamlet,</HI> his Mother, and Father-in-Law drink together on the Stage. They divert themselves with Bottle-Songs, <HI>(Chansons à boire)</HI> they quarrel, they fight and kill. One would imagine this Play the Production of a drunken Savage. And yet among these Absurdities, which render the <HI>English</HI> Drama absolutely barbarous, there are some Strokes in <HI>Ham∣let,</HI> worthy of the most exalted Genius. This has al∣ways been Matter of Astonishment to me; it looks as if Nature, in pure Sport, diverted herself with mix∣ing in <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s Head every thing sublime and great, with all that can be conceived low, mean and detestable.</Q>
<P><PB N="261" REF="272"/>It is thus the elegant and sensible <HI>Voltaire</HI> speaks of <HI>Shakespear.</HI> I would submit it to yourself, Sir, whether this Criticism is candid, and whether it is a fair Dis∣cussion of the Tragedy in Question. We do not con∣cern ourselves in this Country with what is agreeable to the Taste of the Vulgar in <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Italy;</HI> we know that the <HI>Clinquant</HI> of an Opera, or a <HI>Comedie Ballet</HI> is more acceptable to their Refinement, than the sterling Bullion of an <HI>English</HI> Performance; but we might ex∣pect from a Writer of Eminence, a truer and more exact Opinion. <HI>Hamlet,</HI> Sir, does not run mad, though if he did, King <HI>Lear</HI> has proved what a beautiful Distress might arise from it; he counterfeits Madness, for his own private End, but no body ever imagined that he thinks he is killing a Rat, when he slays <HI>Polonius.</HI> If you will be pleased to recollect the Passage, you will find that he takes him for his Better, meaning the King, and that the Rat is only mentioned to save Ap∣pearances.</P>
<P>That <HI>Ophelia</HI>'s Grave is dug on the Stage cannot be refuted; but that very Indecorum produces so many fine Reflections, and such an excellent Vein of Mora∣lity, as perhaps, cannot be parallel'd by the <HI>Scene Fran∣coise,</HI> and is, without doubt, warmer, and more interest∣ing, than the frigid, unimpassioned Declamation of a more correct Writer. I cannot recollect that <HI>Hamlet</HI> ever shocked me with miserable Jests upon this Occa∣sion; not do I remember that any of them are such honest Bottle Companions as to carouse and sing merry Catches on the Stage. Pray consider, Sir, that our Lan∣guage, though no way inferior to the <HI>French,</HI> is not uni∣versally understood Abroad, and from your Representa∣tion of Matters, it may be inferred that our great Poet is really the <HI>drunken Savage,</HI> you have thought pro∣per to call him. This would be derogating from the greatest Poet the World has ever seen since the Days
<PB N="262" REF="273"/>of <HI>Homer,</HI> and, I believe you will grant, is dealing un∣fairly with a Man, whom you cannot but reverence.</P>
<P>When you confess that he has many Flights of the highest Elevation, you make an Approach towards jus∣tice; but I cannot help thinking that you are some∣what like a Painter, who lays on just and proper Colouring, and then instantly effaces it, when you and that you are astonished at his sublime Excursions of Fan∣cy. I should have expected from your Candour, that you would rather have said, it is a Pity that he, who soared to such glorious Heights, should ever tire his Eagle Wing, and fall beneath himself. You may re∣member, that it is with this good Temper <HI>Longinus</HI> talks of <HI>Homer;</HI> they are Dreams, says he, but they are the Dreams of <HI>Homer.</HI> He might, perhaps, with as much Propriety as you, have given the Appellation of a <HI>drunken Savage,</HI> have called him AN OLD DOTARD, and asserted that some of his long Stories are detestable but a candid Critic forgives the Imbecilities of human Na∣ture, and passes Sentence like a mild and good-natured Judge.</P>
<Q>Cum tabulis animum censoris sumet honesti.
<BIBL><HI>HOR.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P>In one of your Letters concerning the <HI>English</HI> Nation, you are greatly pleased with a Saying of the late Lord <HI>Bolingbroke,</HI> in Relation to the Duke of <HI>Marlborough.</HI> "He was," replied that ingenious Nobleman when his Opinion was asked, "so great a Man, that I "have forgot his Faults." Something like this might be your Judgment upon <HI>Shakespear;</HI> and it was more particularly incumbent on you, to treat his Me∣mory with respect, because, I apprehend, you owe very great Obligations to him in many of your own dramatic Writings. We frequently perceive you lighting your Torch at his Fire; in your <HI>Mahomet, Macbeth marshals you the Way that you are going;</HI> in many other Scenes
<PB N="263" REF="274"/>we can catch your Eye fixed upon our immortal Bard; and in your <HI>Semiramis</HI> you have adventured to introduce a Ghost, in Imitation of the very Play, which has oc∣casioned the Severity already cited. The Success you met with upon that Occasion might serve to convince you of <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s inimitable Merit. The <HI>Parterre,</HI> if I mistake not, turned their Backs to the Stage, and blew their Noses; while the Ghost on our Theatre never fails to impress an awful Stillness on every Mind. This, Sir, give me leave to assure you, is not owing to the Barbarity of our Taste, but to the amazing Power of our Poet's Imagination, which could explore the undiscovered Regions of Eternity, and recal the slecting Spirit, with a Solemnity of Ideas responsive to the Occasion.</P>
<P><HI>Shakespear</HI> is a kind of established Religion in Poetry, and his Bays will always stourish with undiminished Ver∣dure. When I say this, I am not for maintaining that he is not guilty of Transgressions, but for every Trans∣gression he recompences his Auditors with Beauties, which no Art will ever equal. That the Rules esta∣blished by <HI>Aristotle</HI> and <HI>Horace</HI> are agreeable to Nature, I am ready to allow, and that inferior Geniuses may avail themselves by a skilful Conformity to them, I as freely assent to. But Fable is but a secondary Beauty; the Exhibition of Character, and the Excitement of the Passions, justly claiming the Precedence in dramatic Poetry. It is in Writing as in Gardening; where Na∣tures does not afford spontaneous Beauties, recourse must be had to the Embellishments of slow endeavouring Art, to the Regularity of uniform Vistas, the Intricacy of elaborated Mazes, and a studied Insertion of Ever∣greens; but when the Course of the Country of itself presents attractive Scenes on every Side, when the Trees branch out with a free Expansion, and the bold Prospect surprizes with the Heath, the Lawn, the Hill,
<PB N="264" REF="275"/>and Valley, in wild Variety, the Littleness of tedious Culture is unnecessary, and trifling Ornaments are un∣looked for.</P>
<P>I shall conclude, with a Passage from your own Works. <Q>Do not blush, Sir, to repent of your little Inadver∣tencies. It is hard, but it is amiable to acknowledge our Errors.</Q> <HI>Ne rougissez point, Monsiour, de vous</HI> <Q><HI>repentir de vos petites Inadvertances. Il est dur, mais il est beau d'avouer ses fautes.</HI></Q></P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Desire of acquiring Money has in all Ages actuated Mankind, and influenced their Conduct in various Shapes, ever since civil Polity framed different States and Re∣publics, and since Convenience stamped an imaginary Value upon yellow Dirt, which soon rendered it by ge∣neral
<PB N="266" REF="277"/>Consent a proper Exchange for the rest of the Commodities of the Earth. By the same Means that it became useful in the ordinary Necessaries of Life, it also in Proportion administered to the Luxuries and magnificent Enjoyments of Society. The Gamester soon learned to carry a thousand Head of Cattle by Proxy to the Dice Room; so many Pieces of Ore be∣came the Representatives of an adequate Number of Trees, and Things went on in this Progression, till at length a modern Beau could carry as many sparkling Acres upon his little Finger, as would have strained a thousand <HI>Alaxes</HI> and <HI>Hectors</HI> of the Days of <HI>Homer.</HI> This last Remark I am proud to Fave an Opportunity of making, as the elegant Species, just mentioned, have for some Time unjustly been exposed to the Rail-Jery of the Epilogue to the <HI>Distressed Mother;</HI> whereas by this Account the pretty Fellows of these Times have very visibly a Superiority over the Prowess and Vigour of the much boasted antient Heroes.</P>
<P>But to return: An Ambition to amass Riches is cer∣tainly very laudable, when it does not transgress the Bounds which are prescribed by Reason to all our Pas∣sions in the general. While it is conducted with a View to a Competency, and the Enjoyment of the Requisites for Subsistence and Comfort; while it ope∣rates with a Propensity to a Man's Friends, Relations, and, as <HI>Milton</HI> has it, all the Charities of Father, Son and Brother; and while it is the Source of Genero∣sity, and an extensive Power of distributing Benefits to Mankind, it is, without any Manner of Doubt, a just Principle of Action; and though Self-love is the Pebble which stirs the Lake, the Circles, which it oc∣casions, will always be pleasing and beautiful to the moral Sense.</P>
<P>But the Misfortune is, this Affection generally de∣generates into Meanness, and has a fatal Tendency to
<PB N="267" REF="278"/>ruin the Understanding, and to corrupt the Heart. The intellectual Soil must not lie fallow for any long Time together; and it is by Freedom of Converse, and an habitual Intercouse with the enlightened Part of the World, that a mental Vigour is to be acquired; and when the Imagination is constantly attached to a parti∣cular Set of Ideas, it becomes narrow by insensible De∣grees, and for Want of that general Survey of the dif∣ferent Objects, which are continually passing on the Scene of Life, it is confined to a small Compass, and never ventures to make the least Excursion further. From this close Habit of Thinking, the Heart, too frequently, contracts a lazy Apathy, and grows entire∣ly callous to all manner of Sensation. Our Passions are involuntary, and are nothing else than the Impres∣sions which external Objects usually make upon the hu∣man Imagination, from the Operations of which we feel those sundry Emotions which are Incitements to spur us on from Theory to Practice, and which disclose themselves in our Actions, and are thence known to be∣long to the amiable Train of <HI>Benevolence,</HI> or to be of the hateful Family of <HI>Selfishness</HI> and <HI>Ill-nature.</HI> In Pro∣portion therefore as the Ideas which pass in the Mind are scanty, the Affections, which agitate the Heart, will be fewer; and both must at last rust to a Point, and fix in a State of unfeeling Indolence.</P>
<P>A Love of Money is at once the Source of those Deeds which carry with them a splendid Appearance, and those also which are at first Sight mean and contemptible. This Passion has made many a Writer of Eminence, and many Scriblers in a Garret; it has animated the General at the Head of an Army, and the Clipper of Coin in his twi∣light Room; it has for many Ages thundered in the Senate, wrangled at the Bar, and lulled from the Pulpit. To this it is owing that the Merchant boldly traverses the Globe, trusting to all the Dangers of the turbulent Ele∣ment,
<PB N="268" REF="279"/>and that <HI>Buckhorse</HI> will receive as many severe Strokes of a Cane as you please, for Six-pence apiece.</P>
<P>The Art generally practised by People, who are de∣sirous either to amass an over-grown Fortune, or to glean up a Livelihood, without the Talents to recom∣mend themselves by striking out some new Discovery, or cultivating some advantageous Branch of Trade and Commerce, is to impose upon the Credulity of Man∣kind; and by obtruding false delusive Circumstances to excite their Curiosity, raise their Admiration, and thus guil them to comply with their Artifices of Fraud and Imposition. This Metropolis has never wanted a suf∣ficient Number of these Projectors, and, at present, I believe I may affirm, that it abounds with Cheats and Impostors, in every Station, in every Art and Science, and in every Circumstance of Life. The solemn Phy∣sician, the specious Lawyer, the wordy Critic, and the bombast Poet, are found in all Quarters of the Town; and though they must be allowed to be very notable Masters of Deceit, I have lately made a Disco∣very of a Personage, who greatly excels them all in their own Trade of Delusion and Hypocrisy. The Scheme of distributing Hand bills, importing that in <HI>Ivy-Lane, Magpye-Alley,</HI> or any other Quarter of the Town, LIVETH a regular Physician, who has spent many Years abroad, travelled all over <HI>Mesopotamia,</HI> and is returned home North about to practise his Profession for the Bene∣fit of his Countrymen, is now entirely out of Vogue, and the Cheat is laughed at by all Degrees and Ranks of People. It is true, there are many other Plans on foot at present, which are somewhat more plausible than that which I have now touched upon; but among them all, I do not remember any Plan so well calculated to elevate and surprize, to keep up a Stare, as a new one which came into my Hands the other Day, as I was walking down <HI>Ludgate Hill.</HI> A tall meagre Man, with great Solemnity of Aspect, and strong Expressions of
<PB N="269" REF="280"/>Amazement in his Countenance, presented to me the following Billet, which many of my Readers can bear me Witness is transcribed faithfully and exactly.</P>
<Q><P>Mrs. <HI>SERMON</HI></P>
<P>Is removed from <HI>Whitchorse-yard, East-Smithfield,</HI> to the Sign of the <HI>Blue-Ball,</HI> in <HI>Naked-Boy Court, Lud∣gate-Hill;</HI> you may turn in by the <HI>Salmon with a Drop in his Mouth,</HI> the second House in the Court. Who resolves all Questions in Astrology, whether by Sea or Land. She likewise gives <HI>gratis</HI> to poor Peo∣ple, a Draught for the Stomach, the Powder for the Tooth-ach, and an Eye-Water.</P></Q>
<P>N. B. <HI>Cures the</HI> Ague <HI>at the Second Cup</HI> gratis.</P>
<P>I have heard that the present celebrated Dr. <HI>Wood∣ward</HI> cures the Rupture, for any Person whatever, by wearing his own Bandages, which indeed hath fre∣quently been Matter of Astonishment to me in my Hours of Reflection; but I must declare, in favour of Mrs. <HI>Sermon,</HI> that I think she performs greater Won∣ders than any of them, and that her Undertaking is more likely to do Honour to our Country, than that of any other Schemist now in being. The Circum∣stance of her living in <HI>Naked-Boy Court</HI> is well in∣serted to raise Curiosity, and the Convenience of turn∣ing in by the <HI>Salmon with a Drop in his Mouth</HI> will prove inviting, especially as every one will be desirous of seeing that curious Animal. How she contrives to answer Questions in <HI>Astrology</HI> is beyond my Comprehen∣sion, but, if well peformed, must be highly useful to his Majesty's Subjects. She does-it also by Sea as well as Land, which is greatly advantageous to a trading Na∣tion; and then her Spirit of Benevolence must tend greatly to endear her to every generous and humane Mind.</P>
<P>The <HI>Draught for the Stomach,</HI> the Powder for the <HI>Tooth-ach,</HI> and the <HI>Eye-Water,</HI> given <HI>gratis,</HI> are strong Indications of a public Spirit. Add to this that she cures the Ague at the second Cup for nothing; what
<PB N="270" REF="281"/>kind of Cup it is, I can't take upon me to say. But upon the whole I must declare that Mrs. <HI>Sermon</HI> is in my Eye a very extraordinary Personage; and were I to decide the Precedence between her and all the Em∣pyrics, Projectors, Fustian-Poets, Discoverers of the Longitude, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the present Age, I should not he∣sitate to pronounce Mrs. <HI>Sermon</HI> the most notable amongst them all.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S there is a Court of Censorial Enquiry subsisting at <HI>Gray's-Inn,</HI> under your In∣fluence, and as I suppose, from the ap∣parent Tendency of it, that it was designed in its first Institution to be a secondary Aid to our Courts of Justice, by taking Cognizance of those Offences which are not punishable by any of the Statute Laws of this Realm, I must take the Liberty to transmit to you an Information of such a Nature, that, I am convinced, you will think it either ought to be laid before the abovementioned Court, or that it deserves to be treated with the Touches of your Pen.</P>

It being quite dark at the Hour of starting, we began our Jour∣ney without so much as knowing one another's Faces, and we were protty well jolted on the Stones, before we were all properly adjusted in our Places. For some Time we were entertained with a Concert of Groans, Sighs, Coughs, and other such agreeable Interjections, to fill up the Pause of Conversation, till having passed the Turnpike, and being arrived to the plain Road, the Gentleness of the Motion, and the Stillness of the Night composed our Company to sleep, as I inferred from the Information of their Noses, which did not cease to ply the Ear, until the Morning began to tinge the Hemisphere towards the East with white Streaks of Light, by the Help of which I could then discover who and who was together. Accordingly I perused the Countenances of my Fellow-Travellers, and pretty plainly read in each Visage, that very Character, which a short Time convinced me was appropriated to each.</P>
<P>The First and most remarkable Personage was the Wife of a wealthy Inhabitant of <HI>Thames-street,</HI> going down to see Life, <Q>for it is really, says she, enough to fill one up with the Vapours, to be eternally moped in that odious Part of the Town, and as soon as I re∣turn, I shall prevail upon Mr. <HI>Narrowmind,</HI> since he has now picked up his Crums, to learn a little Taste, and remove to some gented Quarter.</Q> This Scheme met with the instant Approbation of her next Neigh∣bour, a motherly Sort of Woman, who lets Lodgings at <HI>Bath,</HI> and with whom the polite Citizen was to six her Residence. The good old Landlady declared, as how she was of Opinion, Folks of Mrs. <HI>Narrowmind</HI>'s Fortune should be accommodated with some Elegance; and then turning about, <Q>Ma'em, will you chuse to taste the Liquor I have brought in this little Bottle?
<PB N="273" REF="284"/>I know by Experience, that it is the best Thing in the World to keep Wind out of the Stomach.</Q> This Proposal was agreed to, and a few Minutes con∣vinced the rest of the Company, that a Dram is not only of singular Use to keep Wind out of the Stomach, but also a most excellent Expeller of what Wind may be accidentally lodged there.</P>
<P>While this agreeable Couple were solacing themselves, the Conversation was taken up by one, whom we soon discovered to be a <HI>Jew,</HI> bound for the Rendezvous of many of the People of Fashion, with the double View of partaking of the Diversions of the Place, and get∣ting rid of a little <HI>French</HI> Paste, which lay upon his Hands. He harangued with great Volubility of Speech, and he frequently embellished his Discourse with many lively Flashes of a Diamond Ring, which played upon his Finger. Amidst all his Vivacity, he took Care to be sufficiently attentive to the grand Business of selling the abovementioned Paste, which was with him so ma∣terial a Point, that he never once mentioned the chief Object, which at present engrosses the Thoughts of his whole Nation; but, instead of favouring us with his political Speculations, he amused us with a Sight of numberless pretty Trinkets, the Beauties of which he explained with such an artful Display of his Finger, and so many Flourishes of Speech, that he soon closed a Bargain with the fine Lady, whom I have already mentioned.</P>
<P>The next Person, whom I shall mention, was a young Gentleman, who from a slender Figure, and the Recommendation of five and twenty Years of Age, promised himself some Success among the Ladies, not∣withstanding the late Marriage Act. Not having seen a great deal of the World, his Mind was raw and unin∣formed; struck with Surprize at every Thing that of∣sered, and breaking out into idle Questions upon the most minute Occurrence. I have often observed, that
<PB N="274" REF="285"/>Memory is a prevailing Faculty in weak Intellects, and never fails to prove very troublesome in Com∣pany; and as most Things, when Judgment is want∣ing, are laid up in that Storehouse without Taste or Discernment, they are also produced in the same Manner; according to the old Proverb, <HI>Ill got, Ill gone.</HI> Having dabbled a little in some of our modern Poets, there hardly arose an Incident, but what our Fellow-Traveller would repeat twenty or thirty Verses in a Breath, from Sir <HI>Richard Blackmore,</HI> the CHOICE, or some such ingenious Work; and the Misfortune was, that what he last recited, opened new Traces, and he was sure to continue, as long as his Memory supplied him; like the Man at a Fair, who will spew you up Ribband by the Yard, while there remains any in his Mouth; and this Similitude I take to be very picturesque on the present Occasion, with this Difference only, that what the latter evacuates, does not indicate a bad Digestion; whereas the former constantly discovers a foul Stomach, which cannot contain its Crudities; and on this Account, I take your Ribband Spewer to be much the more agreeable Fellow of the two.</P>
<P>The fifth and last of the Company (as I intend to say nothing of myself) was a perfect Contrast to the Cha∣racter just exhibited; as the Dealer in Verse never of∣fered any Thing of his own, this Original was deter∣mined never to make Use of what came from another's Imagination, but depended entirely upon his own Stock for Fame and Feputation. There is a Saying of Doctor <HI>Swift</HI>'s which, in my Opinion, would be of singular Use to many in human Life; "Never," says that great Genius in a Letter to a young Clergyman, <Q>attempt to shew your Wit, because it is at least ten Thousand to one that you have none.</Q> To this Pre∣cept the Gentleman I am now speaking of, paid no Kind of Regard, his Imagination being constantly upon the Stretch to <HI>elevate</HI> and <HI>surprize,</HI> and <HI>all that;</HI> to
<PB N="275" REF="286"/>start new Turns of Fancy upon every Occasion, and, as it is generally expressed, to say good Things. It was in vain to tell him, that it was not at all incum∣bent on him to be so extremely brilliant, and that his Company did not exact all that Emanation of Genius; my Friend could never be content to deliver himself in the ordinary Way, and you might perceive him per∣petually in deep Study to express himself upon the most trivial Incident.</P>
<P>I shall not trouble Mr. <HI>Ranger</HI> with any of the smart Prettinesses which escaped from this exalted Wit, but, having now acquainted you with the Characters of the Company, I leave it to your own Imagination to sug∣gest, in what Manner the Time must have glided away among People who were all entirely attached to their prevailing Foibles, and who thought of nothing but the Gratification of their own particular Humours. During the whole Journey the Citizen's Wife talked of nothing but her Taste and Dignity, which the good Woman from <HI>Bath</HI> confirmed; the Verse-Spewer thought of nothing but reciting, and the Man of Wit was am∣bitiously new and lively. With regard to the <HI>Jew,</HI> he not only minded the Main-Chance in the Coach, but also at every Inn where we put up; and I remember, that at <HI>Marlborough,</HI> where we breakfasted the se∣cond Morning, we were delayed for a considerable Time, till Search was made after this mercantile I i∣nerant, who was at length found selling a Pair of Buckles to a Gentleman just arrived in a Post-Chaise.</P>
<P>I think, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> you have already mentioned an Attention to Self alone, as one of the greatest Errors in Society; as it must be more particularly so, when People are tied to each other for any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pace of Time, I could wish for a Resormation in this Particular. In the <HI>Spectator</HI> I remember to have seen a Proposal to place a System of Rules for Behaviour on the Side of every Stage Coach in the Kingdom: Now, Sir, as I think
<PB N="276" REF="287"/>something of this Nature absolutely requisite at present, if you would be kind enough to employ a leisure Moment in this Way, it would, I persuade myself, tend to promote good Manners among the People of this Kingdom, and would oblige him, who is with great Respect,</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG> Great deal of Wit and Raillery has been exerted by several polite Writers against the predominant Fashion among the La∣dies, of setting off their Charms with the Addition of Paint. Our great <HI>Shakespear</HI> has put a very severe Remark into the Mouth of his <HI>Hamlet</HI> in the Scene with <HI>Ophelia; Heaven hath given ye one Face, and ye make yourselves another.</HI> This Thought has been twisted and tortured into a thousand different Shapes by every little Endeavourer at an Epigram for a long Time past, and the Custom has been frequently censured as a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olly imported from our Neighbours the <HI>French.</HI> As the Art of giving an artificial Tincture to the Skin, ap∣pears to me to admit of many favourable Circumstances, I shall employ this Day's Paper in Vindication of my pretty Countrywomen.</P>
<P>It may seem at first an extreme bold Position, if I assert that Painting is not an Importation of foreign Refine∣ment, but originally of <HI>English</HI> Growth; and yet, that this is the real State of the Case, is sufficiently known to the most super<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cial Dabbler in History. <HI>Julius Caesar,</HI> in his Account of the Inroad which he made upon our Ancestors, gives a Description of the <HI>Aborigines</HI> of this Island, which I shall here translate. <HI>The Britons in general paint their Bodies with Woad, which gives a blue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>incture to the Skin, and lends them a formidable Affect in Battle.</HI> This, I think, may serve to obviate the Imputation of imi∣tating
<PB N="278" REF="289"/>the <HI>French</HI> in this Particular, which I take to be a Point of some Consequence, as by this we cannot be charged with the Levity of having servilely copied from others. We find that the Ladies among the <HI>British Picts</HI> went entirely naked, and painted their Bodies all over with the <HI>Woad</HI> already mentioned. This must un∣doubtedly have afforded great Scope for Fancy, and in those Days there must certainly have been many eager Rivalships among the Fair for Pre-eminence in point of Taste for Painting. For as the whole lovely Body was ornamented with different Figures and sundry various Representations, according as Imagination suggested, the Variety of new Fashions must have been extremely entertaining, each Fair-one being studious to adapt to each different Part of the Body that Degree of Co∣louring and that Form, which must have proved most becoming; just as our modern Ladies adjust a Patch so as to make the Contrast striking, and give stronger Ex∣pressions to the adjacent Features. I have now by me the whole History of a <HI>British Pict Coquette,</HI> found by a Friend of mine among some antient Manuscripts, and sent to me as a Curiosity.</P>
<P><HI>Cassibelana</HI> was the Lady's Name. She lived in the Capital of the <HI>Trinobantes,</HI> and was remarkable for a fine Stature, and an Head of Hair of a surprizing Length, flowing in wanting Luxuriance down her Back. She always had at her Toilet some of the most exqui∣site <HI>Woad</HI> that could be any where procured, and she was celebrated for her curious Art in preparing it for the Purposes of adorning her Person. The <HI>Woad</HI> being of itself of a blucish Cast, she would sometimes paint no Part of her Body, but where the Veins appeared, and to them she gave such a delicate Colouring, that the pure and elequent Blood as the Poet calls it, seemed to shew itself through her translucent Skin. As soon as she had established this Fashion, and made the rest of her sex her Imitators, she would then suddenly change
<PB N="279" REF="290"/>the Mode, and embellish her whole Body with various Devices.</P>
<P>On the left Side of her Breast she would draw a young <HI>Cupid</HI> aiming an Arrow at her Heart, and on the Right a Lover languishing in amorous Indolence. Each Leg represented an Admirer kneeling at her Feet, and imploring her Compassion, while she, with all the Complacence of self-approving Beauty, let fall her Eyes with Indifference and cold Disdain. On her Back were represented the emblematical Figures of a Train of Pages following her in her way with all the Officious∣ness of careful Attendance. On other Parts of her Person was presented to View, <HI>Venus</HI> in lovely Atti∣tude emerging from the Sea; the <HI>Graces</HI> were also to be seen walking Hand in Hand, their Faces brightened with Chearfulness and mutual Love. In this Manner she would attend at public Sacrifices, where all Eyes were often fixed on her alone; and frequently the ve∣nerable <HI>Druid</HI> could not avoid, even in the Fervour of his Devotion, to cast a Glance upon such an attractive Profusion of Charms.</P>
<P>In this Manner <HI>Cassibelana</HI> captivated the Hearts of all her male Beholders, who carved her Name upon every Oak in the Country, and the banks of <HI>Thames</HI> re-ecchoed to the Musick of her Name. It was univer∣sally agreed that she was the best Painter of her Age; her Colours were warm and glowing; her Figures bold and striking, and the natural Motion of the different Parts of her Body made them appear still more animated and actuated, as it were, with the animal Functions of real Life; an Advantage which the most admired Portraits of the most eminent Painters since her Days could never boast. In all public Places she entirely out∣shined the rest of her Sex, which made her the general Envy of the Ladies, who frequently combined in Parties of Scandal to her Disadvantage, even though Tea was not then known in these Parts of the World. <HI>Cassibelana</HI>
<PB N="280" REF="291"/>was every Day pulled to pieces, according to the mo∣dern Phrase, and though the Ladies allowed that she really had a very lively Fancy in all her Drawings, and an excellent Design in all her Drapery, yet they could not see that she was so fine a Woman, though to be sure she had a pretty Manner <HI>in putting on her Things,</HI> for so they expressed the Covering of <HI>Woad</HI> which served to conceal in some Measure the natural Superficies of her Skin. I am apt to believe that the transparent Ca∣puchin was imagined from a Practice of this famous se∣male <HI>Pict,</HI> because at Times she would lay on the Woad in such a Manner, that Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Line in his Translation of <HI>Homer</HI> may justly be applied to it;
<Q>Her Beauty seems and only seems to shade.</Q> Upon the Whole, <HI>Cassibelana</HI> was Leader of all the Fashions even in <HI>Kent,</HI> the Inhabitants of which were the most polished of all our Islanders, and, as <HI>Caesar</HI> tells us, differed but little from the Manners of the <HI>Gauls,</HI> in like manner as our modern fine Ladies boast at present an exact Conformity to <HI>French</HI> Manners.</P>
<P>From the foregoing Account, which I have rendered as close as possible from the Manuscript now in my Possession, it appears, that even in the Days of the purest Simplicity, Painting was the universal Practice; and therefore strongly am I inclined to think it laudable in the amiable Sex at present. I am further pleased to see the Fashions of the Ladies tending more rapidly every Day to a greater Similitude to the Customs of our Ancestors; for it is very manifest that they are every Day becoming more and more naked, and it is ob∣servable that they who display most of their lovely Bo∣dies make the greatest Use of Paint, which in my Opinion, is not used from a Motive of female Vanity, but as a modest and decent Covering to the Skin. I must, by the Way take notice that there is one Cir∣cumstance in which the modern Practice of Painting differs from antient Simplicity. I do not find in the
<PB N="281" REF="292"/>Account of any Historian, that the female <HI>British Picts</HI> applied the least Tincture of the Woad to the natural Complexion of their Faces. For a Bloom and a Viva∣city of Colour they trusted to Exercise, fresh Air, and wholesome Diet. But as the fashionable Vigils of Gam∣ing were unknown in those Days, it must be allowed that this is an Improvement upon the Fashions of our Progenitors; and indeed it could not be expected that in those rude Times so elegant a Diversion could be known. For this we are indebted to modern Refine∣ment, which has introduced Improvements in Manners, as well as in Arts and Sciences.</P>
<P>For my Part, I expect to see the Time when the Ladies will be to all Intents and Purposes as naked as our Ancestors; and, in my Apprehension, if Things proceed with equal Celerity, the Period is not very distant, as their Cloaths are amazingly reduced at both Ends within these few Years. We shall not then com∣plain, that the Importation of <HI>French</HI> Hoops, and <HI>French</HI> Fashions of all Sorts, are a Detriment to the Na∣tion; Mercers and Milliners will be useless Things, and the Ladies will spend the Hours of the Toilet in Draw∣ing and Painting, by which Means I flatter myself that the <HI>British</HI> Fair will be able to boast their <HI>Guidos,</HI> their <HI>Titians,</HI> and their <HI>Raphaels.</HI> To this End an ingenious Gentleman of my Acquaintance is now drawing up a System of Directions to a female Painter, which will serve to aid their Invention, and give them a proper Notion of Design and Colouring in all their Faces, by which Means it is to be hoped they will greatly excel all the boasted Masters in every School of Painting.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>t the last Meeting of our Club, Mr. <HI>Plastic,</HI> the <HI>Shafts∣burian</HI> Philosopher and Chairman for the Time being, desired he might furnish the Essay of this Day.</P>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG> Taste for the imitative Arts is the highest Embellishment and ultimate Finishing of an accomplished Mind; it gives an Elegance to a Man's Way of thinking, throws a Polish on his Manners, and by insensible Degrees re∣fines the Passions and Affections of the Soul. It may be added, that a fine Taste is the Inlet of some of the
<PB N="284" REF="295"/>most delicate Pleasures human Life is susceptible of, and may therefore properly be called, in the Language of <HI>Shaftsourian</HI> Philosopy, <HI>the internal Sense,</HI> as, by Means of this Faculty, we are acquainted with many elegant Sensations, to which the Generality of Men seem to be entirely Strangers. This Talent is not un∣like the Power of seeing, just conferred on one whose Eye never could distinguish Colours; it opens new Traces of thinking, awakens pleasing Ideas, and dif∣fuses a Complacence through the whole intellectual Frame.</P>
<P>There is nothing more common than to see Men, who, perceiving the Advantages which this elegant Turn gives to a chosen Few, and observing that Quickness of Sensibility for which they are remarkable, affect upon all Occasions to be endowed with the same nice Faculty of Perception; but the Misfortune is, they are absolutely callous to each fine Impression, and the Method they chuse, to convince us of their Delicacy, is by pretending, that nothing is refined enough for them. Thus, while others distinguish themselves by yielding to the Impulse of a Passion artfully excited by a Strain of Music, a Poem, or a Picture, these Gentlemen would recommend themselves upon the Strength of their having never been pleased at any Rate. This Proce∣dure is for the most part to be observed in modern <HI>Cri∣tics</HI> or the <HI>Malevoli.</HI> A Piece where every Beauty of Language and Sentiment is united, where in the strik∣ing Passages every Line is impassioned, and swells with the Emotion of the Soul, like Glass in a Furnace, in∣formed by the Breath infused into it, laid before one of this Class, shall be received with cold Disdain; and a Composition of <HI>Arne</HI>'s, full of all the Sweetness of mu∣sical Expression, shall to their finer Organs sound like the most jarring Dissonance. If a Man in a Club of Gentlemen should be perpetually displeased with every Thing, while the rest of the Members perceive no
<PB N="285" REF="296"/>Cause of Complaint, I apprehend there would be a strong Presumption, that his Mouth was at those Sea∣sons greatly out of Taste; and with equal Propriety, whoever boasts an Over-refinement of Understanding, should be set down, without Hesitation, as one whose mental Organs are distempered. As Matters are fre∣quently managed, a fine Taste, instead of being a Power of receiving elegant Sensations, would prove an Avenue for Uneasiness, Discontent, and a constant Dislike of every Thing around us; and it would fare with this exquisite Degree of intellectual Feeling, as with him, whose external Senses are framed to re∣ceive acuter Impressions than our Employments in Life will admit.</P>
<Q><L>Say what the Use were finer Optics giv'n,</L>
<L>T' inspect a Mite, not comprehend the Heav'n?</L>
<L>Or Touch, if tremblingly alive all o'er,</L>
<L>To smart and agonize at ev'ry Pore?</L>
<L>Or, quick Effluvia darting thro' the Brain,</L>
<L>Die of a Rose in aromatic Pain?</L>
<BIBL><HI>POPE.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P>But Nature has not cast us in so delicate a Mould: Both our bodily and mental Powers are fitted to ad∣minister to our Enjoyments, and are by no means contrived to be the Cause of Fretfulness, and a pe∣tulant Peevishness, which serve only to sour the Tem∣per, and become troublesome and disagreeable in Society.</P>
<P>To define a true Taste may be unnecessary at present, as it has been often done by abler Pens; but, I believe, it will be judged pertinent to the Subject in Hand, to give the Reader some Description of it. Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> ob∣serves, that many abstract Ideas are expressed by Terms taken from the Perceptions of our external Senses, such as to <HI>imagine, comprehend, conceive, adhere,</HI> &amp;c. which are
<PB N="286" REF="297"/>all applied to Modes of thinking. In like Manner, the Term now in Question is derived from the Sensation of our Palate, which we call Taste, and, on account of some Similitude in the Operation, i applied to the in∣tellectual Faculty by Men of Imagination in all Lan∣guages; the Information given to the Mind being in both Cases rapid and instantaneous, without waiting for the more cool and deliberate Sentence of Reflection.</P>
<P>Hence naturally arises a Distinction between Taste and Judgment; which are often used as synonymous Expressions, but are notwithstanding very different in themselves. I believe, many of my Readers know Peo∣ple among their Acquaintance, who, if you lay a Pic∣ture before them, upon mature Deliberation, and after comparing leisurely the Copy with their own Ideas of Nature, can pronounce the Piece to be like, without manifesting any particular Relish or Pleasure, which is always a concomitant Circumstance with the Man of Taste. It is he that enters into the Spirit and Stile of an Author, sees in an Instant how he selects the Circum∣stances in a Description, enjoys the Turn of his Ex∣pression, and his Art in seizing the Passions; and it is upon a Review of what thus strikes the Mind, that the Critics of all Ages have been able to lay down Rules for Taste; as Theories of Vision are framed from an Exa∣mination of the Organs of Sight, and the Manner in which external Objects operate upon them; and hence the <HI>French</HI> Wits have told us, that nothing can be ele∣gant, which is not true, upon an Observation that the Mind turns with Distaste from any Thing, which con∣tradicts its own Ideas.</P>
<P>It is recorded of <HI>Marcus Antoninus,</HI> that he acknow∣ledged it to the Gods as a peculiar Felicity, that he had not cultivated his Taste for Works of Imagination, for fear they might have detained him from Objects of higher Importance; but, for my Part, I cannot help wondering that he did not rather thank Heaven for the

<P>With this Talent, a Man may retire into his Closet, and there enjoy a more delicious Repast, and better Company, than can be met with in any modern As∣sembly. <HI>Homer</HI> never denies himself to any Acquaintance, and <HI>Virgil</HI> is always easy of Access, whether you de∣light in sublime Description, or the softer Beauties of rural Imagery.

In short, to a Mind well harmonized, all Nature wears a pleasing Aspect, and the Transition is easy from a Re∣lish for external Beauty, and the Pleasures arising from Poetry, Eloquence, and the Arts of Imitation, to a Love for moral Perfection and the Dignity of Character.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>Henever any particular Object becomes the principal and favourite Idea of a Man's Imagination, it derives from thence an ad∣ventitious Air of Importance, and attracts his Attention as irresistibly, as Matters of the highest Moment. Of this Truth I met an egregious Proof in an Acquaintance of mine, who happened to fall into my Company a few Days since at the Coffee∣house. While great Numbers of our Countrymen are busied in Enquiries after Mr. <HI>Keene</HI>'s Negoti∣ations at the Court of <HI>Madrid,</HI> to prevent the Depre∣dations of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> upon <HI>English</HI> Merchantmen; while some are interested in the Election a of King of the <HI>Romans,</HI> and others employed in a Discussion of the Naturalization Act; this Gentleman is entirely ab∣stracted in his Speculations, and concerns himself in
<PB N="290" REF="301"/>the Regulation of an imaginary World with more Soli∣citude, than any Politician in what is immediately con∣nected with the Interest of his Country.</P>
<P>Upon my asking him the ordinary Question, <Q><HI>What News?</HI></Q> He replied, <Q>There is something in Agi∣tation, Sir, in both Kingdoms, but it has not as yet transpired; though I have a secret Channel for Intel∣ligence, and, I believe, I am pretty well in the Se∣cret; both Cabinets endeavour to suppress their In∣tentions, but my Information comes from the Board of Green Cloth.</Q> — At this Expression my Friend perceived me somewhat surprized, and he therefore thought proper to explain himself, <Q>The Board of Green-Cloth, Sir,</Q> says he, <Q>is a metaphorical Term I generally make use of to signify what is vul∣garly call the <HI>Green Room;</HI> perhaps you never saw the <HI>Green-Room;</HI> it is the Place where the Performers rendezvous during the Play, and for some Time after it; that of <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> is in the Form of an Ob∣long, and I'll give you a particular Description of it.</Q></P>
<P>Here I was reduced to a Necessity of mentioning, that it would be supersluous to give himself so much Trouble, as that Place was as well known to me as the Coffee-Room we were in; which Hint I judged not improper, as I knew that a violent Propensity to De∣scription was one of my Friend's Singularities, and that he is never so compleatly happy as when an Opportu∣nity offers for him to display his florid Talents for this Embellishment of Conversation. Upon these Occasions I have frequently observed his Eye sparkle with a pe∣culiar Brillancy, which never fails to be extinguished whenever he is checked in his Career, as was the Case with him at present. After looking serious for some Time, he reassumed his Discourse—<Q>The Theatrical World, Sir, is nothing now to what it was formerly; the People are infatuated with <HI>Garrick;</HI>
<PB N="291" REF="302"/>— He has introduced a new Taste entirely; I could wish I had lived in the Days, when <HI>Lun</HI> was in his meridian Splendor; Sir, I have been delighted at a Recital of the many Feats he used to perform. Don't you think it must have given the quickest Sensations of Surprize to an Audience, to see him in the Cha∣racter of <HI>Harlequin,</HI> making his Escape into the Tub —(the Tub, Sir, is the Box over the Stage Door) —and when he was closely pursued by his Enemies, it must have been delightful to perceive him dart, as quick as an Arrow to its destined Mark, or with the Celerity of a Bird in the Air, from the Place, where the whole House imagined him destitute of the Means of an Escape, into the opposite Box, and there stand laughing at his Pursuers. There was al∣ways such an Exertion in his nervous System, that— I don't know whether you ever saw an Anatomy— but I can lend you an Author upon the Animal Oeco∣nomy, from whom it will appear manifestly, upon the clearest Principles, how this was performed. It would astonish you to hear the several Accidents he met with; when he was locked in Arm over Arm, with another at the Top of a Scene, they both fell down, clasped in each other's Embrace; and how do you think he escaped?—with an amazing Agility he turned his Fellow-performer under him, so that he came down quite easy, while the other broke his Collar-bone.—Perhaps you never would be able to guess how many Steps he made in running in a cir∣cular Manner round the Stage; three Thousand Steps, Sir—the Movement of each Leg was so small and quick, that in going the Length of one Foot, he minced it so as to make three hundred Steps—look ye Sir <HI>(wetting his Finger)</HI> here's a Circle on the Table; and now suppose my two Fingers to be his Legs, then conceive them to move in this Manner —you see there's nothing so easy—they may say
<PB N="292" REF="303"/>what they will of the Hero of <HI>Drury Lane;</HI> he only imitates Men, whereas the <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> Chief con∣verts himself into a wild Beast, a Bird, or a Serpent with a long Tail and what not. I believe there will be some∣thing done next Winter; there is a Scheme on Foot to work the little Fellow. The Thing is, we are to have an old Pantomime Entertainment, new vamped, with an additional Scene of a <HI>Scythian</HI> Winter-Piece, which I am convinced will draw the whole Town after it. There are already several Agents sent to <HI>Russia</HI> to purchase a sufficient Number of Bears, and a large Quantity of Ice is now actually making. The Ice, Sir, will be disposed on the Stage in large Rocks, and the Beasts will be sent on shivering amidst the hoary Frosts; in one Part of the Scene the Sun will be dis∣covered, but shorn of his Beams, as <HI>Milton</HI> has it; the rigid Frost will be impervious to his Rays, and you will see the Lightning play upon the impassive Ice. There will also be exhibited at a Distance a lofty Mountain, from whose Summit will come roaring down a tumultuous Cataract, loud, and impetuous in its Course, and at the Bottom will be placed a Re∣servoir to collect the rushing Torrent, where it will form itself into a smooth expansive River, which is to glide off in the Sight of the Spectators. There will also be situated on the Banks of the River a Man with a Fishing-Rod, intent upon catching the Tenants of the watery Plain, when on a sudden the Au∣dience will perceive the Stream arrested in its Course by the Intenseness of the Frost, and the Fisherman's Line made a Prisoner for the Remainder of the Sea∣son. The Water-fall also will instantly be stopp'd by the gelid Season, and the Spectators will have the Pleasure of perceiving the pendant Isicle. This, Sir, will be performed with Ease, though the Man∣ner of its Operation will be imperceptible to the vulgar Eye. But there is no Difficulty in the Thing;
<PB N="293" REF="304"/>for, as the Torrent is to come down in Sheets of Water, which will be represented with a glistening Kind of Tin, it will be extremely practicable to stop the Tin all at once, and in that Case the curious will admire the Wonders of the liquid Stone; <HI>liquidi Mi∣racula saxi,</HI> you know <HI>Claudian</HI> talks of, and to all this will be added several other Ornaments that will tend greatly to heighten the Entertainment.</Q></P>
<P>The Theatrical Projector had gone on thus far with∣out Interruption, and upon my offering to make some Animadversions upon his Scheme, he altered the Po∣sition of his Features, looked grave, and in a short Time walked off without saying a Word. The Reason of this I take to be, that my Friend is never happy, but when the Company is attentive to his own Narratives. Be that as it will, I must own for my Part, that I should be glad to see <HI>Harlequin</HI> banished from all polite Au∣diences to his native <HI>Sadler's-Wells,</HI> to see <HI>Shakespear</HI> triumph over every Heart, and to view both Play∣houses succeeding by the Force of just acting, rational Performances, and a simple Conformity to Nature, which would introduce such a Reformation in our Di∣versions, as to render them of public Utility to the Morals of the <HI>British</HI> People.</P>

<P>SINCE our last arrived a Mail from <HI>Enfield,</HI> by which we learn, that the Company, at the last Assembly, were deprived of the Presence of <HI>Bob Nankeen,</HI> by an unfortunate Accident, which that Gentleman met with as he was riding thither to take the Diversion of Dan∣cing. It seems he was stopped on <HI>Stamford-Hill</HI> by a single Highwayman, who rifled his Pockets, and took from him the following Effects: Two Guineas in Gold, and some Silver; a clean Shirt, a white Handkerchief, and a Pair of Silk Stockings out of one Coat Pocket;
<PB N="294" REF="305"/>a Pair of Pumps, and a Bag-Wig out of the other; a Pair of Paste-Buckles out of his Waistcoat Pocket, and a Book of Directions for Country Dances—Mr. <HI>Nankeen</HI> was so disconcerted by this Accident, that he immediately returned to Town, and left his intended Partner quite forlorn at the Assembly, untill <HI>Nat Pigtail</HI> condescended to dance with her for the Remainder of the Evening.</P>
<P>Advices from <HI>Hamstead</HI> inform us, that all Differences between the upper and lower Town are amicably ad∣justed, and that the Ladies all mix in the genteel romp∣ing of a Country Dance, without being disturbed by Jealousies about Precedence, or Fidgets occasioned by Envy at the Sight of superior Beauty, sine Cloaths, <HI>&amp;c..</HI></P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> Mr. <HI>Simper</HI> is desired to give over that affected Bow, and Mr. <HI>Taperlimbs</HI> is to take Notice, that his manner of looking down at his Legs in the Middle of his Minuet with Self-Admiration, is not at all agreeable to us.</P>
<P>We hear from <HI>Richmond</HI> that on the last Assembly Night there, there were but five Persons in the Long-Room, and it is further said that this Desertion from so beautiful a Part of the Country is entirely occasioned by the Impositions of the Trades-People of the Town, with whom it seems it is a Maxim, that Strangers can∣not be made to pay too dear for every Thing.</P>
<P>By Letters from <HI>Sunning-Hill,</HI> we learn that there is a spiendid Appearance there at Breakfast every <HI>Monday</HI> Morning, and it is imagined that a flying Machine will shortly be set up for the Convenience of those, who are desirous of reaching the <HI>Royal-Exchange,</HI> before the Door-keeper begins his usual cry, <Q>Locking up Gentle∣men—Gentlemen I must lock the Gate.</Q></P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T was a very particular Pleasure to me to learn the other Morning from my Friend <HI>Wildair,</HI> that the Season for Theatrical Diversion is to commence this Evening From this Information I was insensibly led into some Re∣flexions upon the Profession of Playing, which has been in most Ages held in a lower Degree of Estimation than any other Occupation in Life. How this should have obtained in a Point which Reason does not sug∣gest, is somewhat surprizing, though it may not be Matter of extreme Difficulty to trace the Error to its Source.</P>
<P>The Players, if I mistake not, made their first Ap∣pearance in the World after the same Manner, in which the most abandoned and wretched of our Days make their Exit, that is to say, in a Cart. In this Vehicle they strolled about from Place to Place, under the Di∣rection of <HI>Thespis,</HI> who was their Manager; they had their Faces all bedaubed with Lees of Wine, which, no doubt, contributed not a little with other contingent Circumstances to render them ridiculous. And indeed, in this Situation of the Drama, it is no Wonder that they were looked upon as a Set of Low Fellows. By insensible Degrees Matters were improved to greater Elegance, though the old Opprobrium still continued to adhere to the Performers, and perhaps their own Way of Life, their own Morals, their own Behaviour, and the Appearance they every where made, deserved, that the first Impression should not be effaced. By the
<PB N="296" REF="307"/>same Means, the Prejudice has been derived down from Age to Age, and till within these few Years passed, the Laws, which public Opinion had established, con∣tinued in full Force, till at Length they were repealed in Favour of the Few, whose Life and Conversation should deserve it. Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> talking of <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s Time, observes, <Q>that as the best Playhouses were then Inns and Taverns (the <HI>Globe,</HI> the <HI>Hope,</HI> the <HI>Red Bull,</HI> the <HI>Fortune,</HI> &amp;c.) so the Top of the Profession were then meer Players, not Gentlemen of the Stage: They were led into the Buttery by the Steward, not placed at the Lord's Table, or Lady's Toilet; and consequently were entirely deprived of those Advan∣tages they now enjoy, in the familiar Conversation of our Nobility, and an Intimacy (not to say Dearness) with People of the first Condition.</Q></P>
<P>Certain it is, the Sentiments of Mankind have been very much changed in this Respect of late Years, and indeed, in all Ages and among all Men of Sense, the Prejudice never had much Weight, whenever there ap∣peared one abstracted from the common Herd, who, be∣sides the other Qualities requisite in his Business, was pos∣sessed of a good Understanding, adorned and embellished with Modesty, Decency, and good Manners. Thus we find among the <HI>Romans, Roscius,</HI> the Player, was held in general Esteem by all Men of Taste and Re∣finement. <HI>Cicero</HI> loved him living, and at his Decease paid an immortal Tribute to his Memory. He omitted no Opportunity of celebrating his Name, and in one of his most famous Orations, <Q>Who is there, says he, among us of so rude and unfeeling a Disposition, as not to have been very sensibly affected at the Death of <HI>Roscius,</HI> who though he died in an extreme old Age, on Account of his excellent Art, and his every Elegance deserved to be exempt from that Debt of human Nature." "<HI>Quis nostrum tam animo agresti ac
<PB N="297" REF="308"/>duro fuit, ut Roscii morte nuper non commoveretur? Qui cum esset senex mortuus, tamen propter excellentem artem, ac venustatem, videbatur omninò mori non debuisse.</HI></Q> Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> was also the Friend, the Companion, the Fa∣vourite of a Set of Men, who were the chief Honour to our Country; <HI>Dryden, Pope, Rowe, Addison, Congreve, Steel,</HI> and the famous Doctor <HI>Radcliffe</HI> were the Person∣ages that received him with open Arms; and if Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> should never be able to boast such an exalted Acquaintance, it is for this only Reason, because it is hardly to be expected, that such a Set of Men will again appear together.</P>
<P>A compleat Actor appears so seldom in the World, that I do not wonder, whenever a <HI>real Prometheus</HI> with true Fire starts up among us, at the Tribute of Admi∣ration and Applause, which is paid to him by the ge∣neral Consent; and so many Requisites are necessary to form one, who can thus extort the public Approbation, that, I own, I should not be surprized if this Art rose much higher in the Eyes of the Judicious. There are many external Accomplishments, which in other Pro∣fessions may be dispensed with, but the fine Performer must have a well formed Person, a graceful Deport∣ment, a well turned Face, a just Disposition of Fea∣tures, and an Eye expressive of the various subtile Move∣ments of the Mind; he must have improved the Air of his whole Person by an Habitude and Intercourse with Gentlemen; and he must add to all this a Voice, not only to articulate each Syllable distinctly and with Pre∣cision, but also to deliver each Sentence with Grace and Harmony.</P>
<P>Besides these external Qualifications, what a Train of mental Endowments is absolutely necessary? A good Understanding cultivated by a liberal Education, a true Taste and Relish for all the Beauties in an Author, a just Sense of every Passage, and the Idea appropriated to each Word, a thorough Knowledge of Character;
<PB N="298" REF="309"/>an Imagination warm and alive to each fine Stroke of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oet; a Sensibility of Temper, properly susceptible of each Passion the Writer addresses himself to, and a Power of exciting that Passion in others. What and how great that Power is, the following Passage in <HI>Ham∣let</HI> will better convey to the Reader, than any Thing I have to offer on the Subject. <Q>Is it not mon∣strous that this Player here, but in a Fiction, in a Dream of Passion, should so force his Soul to his own Conceit, that from her working all his Visage wanned Tears in his Eyes, Distraction in his Aspect, a broken Voice, and a Function suiting with Forms to his Conceit?</Q></P>
<P>From this Account, I apprehend, it must ap∣pear, that this Profession should be reckoned among the liberal and imitative Arts, and at the same Time I must observe, that it cannot be thought too slightly of in those, who repeat the mere Words in a vacant un∣feeling Manner, or whose Art consists in a wry Mouth, or a Burn on the Jaw. But when every Look, Gesture, and Action is governed by the Soul, when the Imagi∣nation is wrapped, and the Audience catch it by Con∣tagion; when the Artist imparts new Motions to our Spirits, wrings the Soul with fancied Grief, and fills us with imaginary Terrors, then we perceive a Genius which cannot be too much admired. I have often la∣mented that the Poverty of our Language does not afford a Term sufficiently expressive to distinguish such a Performer from the rest of his Fraternity; as I al∣ways study to avoid Confusion in my Ideas, I en∣deavour to seperate them in my own Mind by Words which appear to me to be best appropriated to them, and, till a better Distinction is pointed out, I would chuse to call a Person, such as I have described, an Imi∣tator or an Actor, and he, who pretends to the Art without any Knowledge of Nature, should be set down a <HI>mere Player.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="310"/>In this Sense Mr. <HI>Barry</HI> will always be accounted a fine Actor, and Mrs. <HI>Cibber</HI> an Actress of irresistible skill. It would not be, perhaps, unentertaining to examine the List of <HI>Dramatis Personae</HI> belonging to each Playhouse, and when we should not find the <HI>Actor</HI> alone, it might be diverting to see how both are blended, and to enquire which is prevalent; but the Reader, if he approve the Hint, may pursue it in his own Imagination.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> HAVE been ever highly delighted with the Passage, which I have this Day selected from <HI>Virgil</HI> for a Motto to my Paper. They are the Words of <HI>Evander,</HI> when he is re∣ceiving the pious <HI>Trojan</HI> Prince under his humble, but hospitable Roof. If I remember right, Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> was an Admirer of the beautiful Simplicity of this Address, As I have his Volumes at Hand, I shall here transcribe the Passage.</P>
<Q><L>Honour our annual Feast, and take your Seat</L>
<L>With friendly Welcome at a homely Treat.</L></Q>
<P>This Sentiment, however, short the Translation may be is highly admirable in the Original, and should be im∣pressed in very lively and deep Characters on every Man's Heart who is desirous of sharing the social Pleasures of Life.</P>
<P>Content is most certainly the surest Source of an in∣ternal Happiness; it not only reconciles a Person to
<PB N="301" REF="312"/>himself, but also to those with whom he converses. To use <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s Phrase, it is the chief Nourisher in Life's Feast, and when giddy Mirth and Noise have subsided, this keeps on an equal Tenor, and if it never rises very high, it has at least this Advantage, that it does not ebb so low as to leave Shoals and Rocks dis∣covered. Mirth may properly be called an <HI>Aurora Borealis;</HI> whereas Good Humour, like a fixed Star, sheds a constant Stream of Light, which, if it does not dazzle, has at least at all Times a chearing Influence.</P>
<P>If good Humour has this Advantage annexed to it, Discontent must certainly be attended with many poig∣nant Inconveniences; In the same Proportion that Ease endears and enlivens our Days, its Reverse must bring on each Morn in a Turbulence of Clouds; the Spirits are perpetually sinking, and all the Uses of this World, as the Poet has it, seem to him weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable. The Infection is always rankling in his Breast, and he lives in an unceasing State of Hostility with himself and his Neighbours. This by Degrees grows into a fixed Habit, and then a lowering invariable Gloom hangs over his Mind, and as he does not feel any Peace in his own inward Frame, he is not tender about the Un∣easiness he may create in another's Breast. He there∣fere gives an unlimited Vent to his Sullenness, and is ever finding fault with every Thing around him.</P>
<P>There is one Circumstance which has a Kind of Ten∣dency to alleviate this Perversity of Disposition, and that is, that the Propensity to Satyr, which this Sul∣lenness gives the Mind, is often the Occasion of starting new and uncommon Remarks. We sometimes hear from these Kind of Humourists Strokes of a pee∣vish Pleasantry, which are not unentertaining; and as these People are ever fond of exhibiting a <HI>Caricature</HI> of their Acquaintances, we now and then receive some Sketches or Pictures in Miniature, in which the Colouring and the Drapery are so whimsi∣sically
<PB N="302" REF="313"/>imagined, that we really derive no small De∣gree of Diversion from their extravagant Turn. But notwithstanding this Degree of Mirth which they invo∣luntarily excite, it does not sufficiently compensate for the Trouble they give for the most part. A Man, who can find no Relish in any Thing, should be banished from Society; he should be sent to an Infirmary of <HI>Valetudinarians,</HI> and there be confined until he purges away his ill Humours, or until Reason dispels the Mist which has obscured his Intellects.</P>
<P>The sure<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> way of pleasing in Company, is for a Man to be pleased inwardly; and he that is not so, should retire and brood over his Uneasiness, and not become troublesome, or invade the Harmony of Society. I cannot help considering this fixed and permanent ill Humour as a Kind of <HI>Black-Jaundice,</HI> through the dark Medium of which every Thing that passes takes a Tinc∣ture. I know a Person at present who has been in a <HI>Black-Jaundice</HI> for many Years, and he is still suffered by his Friends to go about finding Fault, perpetually dis∣satisfied, discontented, and grumbling. <HI>Sullen</HI> is his Name, and he is known by his Acquaintance to be one of the greatest Mal-Contents in the Creation.</P>
<P>As soon as Mr. <HI>Sullen</HI> wakes in a Morning, if he has had a good Night's Repose, <Q>Damn it, he cries, what made me oversleep myself.</Q>—He then rings his Bell; the Servant has not Wings, and of course does not fly to him; Mr. <HI>Sullen</HI> is then tempted to throw something at the Scoundrel's Head. The next Thing the Servant is ordered to do, he performs with the utmost Alacrity, <Q>Sirrah! Rascal! cries <HI>Sullen,</HI> are you mad?—May be you're drunk this Morning already?—Can't you do your Business with a little Discretion?—You Blockhead!</Q>—He then seats him∣self to Breakfast; his Tea is intolerable, the <HI>India</HI> Com∣pany should be all shot dead, like so many Thieves; they have monopolized the Trade, and never import
<PB N="303" REF="314"/>a Grain of real Tea—And those <HI>Creols</HI> too, and be damned to them! they send us nothing but Molosses for Sugar.</P>
<P>One of those Gentlemen invited him the other Day to a Turtle-Feast. The Turtle was of a very great Size and accounted extremely fine, by the Connoisseurs in this Sort of Eating; it was dressed at the Owner's Country-House by the most skilful Cook in <HI>London.</HI> <Q>Pshaw! Damn it, exclaims <HI>Sullen,</HI> this is no Turtle;—there never was a Bit of Turtle in <HI>England</HI> and the Scoundrel of a Cook, I'd shoot such a Fellow—Pshaw! the People in this Country never eat—they don't know what it is to eat—so it's called Mutton, or Bee, that's enough for them—damn this Callipash and this Calli∣pee, and the Fat—I'd as soon eat so much green Horn —Here, you Scoundrel, hand me a Glass of Punch. —Punch do you call this! Yes, Sir, made with <HI>Ja∣maica</HI> Rum!—Pshaw! There is not a Drop in it —Gin, or may be some of that Trash, that the tall <HI>Irish</HI> Fellow there talks of.—<HI>Whiskee</HI>—Po! —Give me a Glass of that <HI>Rhenish—Rhenish!</HI> —rot-gut—Sour Cyder—Who is that Woman there at the upper end of the Table?—She counted handsome!—a Fright!—I'd smother such a Woman—And that tall Fellow there too. He's in the House of Commons, I think—a Senator— Pshaw!—fit for a Parliament of <HI>Hottentots</HI>—This is counted a pretty Country Seat too!—pretty in∣deed!—I'd as soon take a Country-Lodging in <HI>Thames-street.</HI></Q></P>
<P>In this Manner does <HI>Sullen</HI> torment himself, and with the Affectation of finer Feelings than his Neigh∣bours, he perversely makes himself unhappy. Mr. <HI>Sullen</HI> once passed a Week in the Country, where I happened to be; he grumbled like a Mastiff in the great Yard all the Time he continued there; and, after his Departure, the Servant found in his Room the following
<PB N="304" REF="315"/>Memorandum with some Snuff in it, with which I shall close this Paper.</P>
<P>Came down in a Post-Chaise with the Squire—a damned uneasy one—Horses only fit for a Dray, and the Squire should be a Drayman—Weather infernal! —Vile Situation!—Inconvenient House, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Slept very ill—owing to the Badness of the Bed —Never like to be out of my own Bed—My Friend's Wife damned ugly in a Morning—A frosty Face Devil.—</P>
<P>Mutton warm with Life served up to Dinner— Mutton should be always kept a Week—nothing but Brown Bread at Table—not a Drop of real Wine in the House.—</P>
<P>Took a Walk out upon the Lawns—Grass all wet —Got a damned cold—Weather cursed bleak —Don't like Miss <HI>Favonia</HI>'s Breath—Believe I was cheated at Cards.</P>
<P>Curate of the Parish dined with us—A strange Thing of a Wife with him.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> Believe the tall Fellow will lie with with her.</P>
<P>Sick in my Stomach all the Morning—Owing to their hard Food—Memorandum to go away with∣out taking Leave of the Family, or giving any Thing to those Scoundrels the Servants.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HEN <HI>Virgil's Aeneas</HI> and his Friend <HI>Achates</HI> were entering the Town, which <HI>Dido</HI> was raising, <HI>Venus</HI> diffused a Cloud around her favourite Son, in order to secure him from every human Eye, and protect him from the Inconveniences to which he might be liable, if seen by the Inhabitants. This parental Care proved very useful to the Hero, and we find some∣thing like it is practised by <HI>Mother Dulness,</HI> who never fails to manifest a tender concern for her chosen Sons, and accordingly they are often enveloped in a Cloud of Ob∣scurity, which no Ray of Light can pierce, and thereby they are enabled to proceed in their Works of Dark∣ness, without Lett or Molestation. But though there is this Similitude in the Fate of the Favourites of the <HI>Cloud-compelling Queen of Dullness,</HI> and the Offspring of <HI>Venus,</HI> it is observable, that there is a very wide Difference in the Conduct of both. The latter, we are told, admired as he journeyed on, the Industry and La∣bour of the People, the Plan of their Town, and the Nobleness of their Streets. He was highly pleased with the Magnificence of the Structures, and the Time he spent in surveying the Pieces of Painting in their Temple, shewed he had a Taste for the fine Arts. But the <HI>Grub-street Race,</HI> behold with Envy the learned In∣dustry of Genius, and from their hidden Place of Ob∣scurity their Malice is daily levelled at those, who they know cannot detect their covered Malice, and superior Merit is the Mark at which they take their envenomed Aim.
<PB N="307" REF="318"/>There is however this Comfort remaining, that their Arrows are too blunt to penetrate, and the Mist, from whence they issue serves greatly to retard their Force; by which Means they often fall to the Ground with shameful Debility, innocent of the Wound they were intended to inflict.</P>
<P>To drop the long-spun Allegory; the anonymous Li∣beller is the Pest of Society, and it is with Pleasure I have observed, that Lampoons of late have fallen Dead-born from the Press, without procuring their Au∣thors a single Dinner. I was the other Day in a Pamphlet-Shop, when a Writer of Defamation came in to enquire after the Success of his Production; <Q>Sells middling, Sir, says the Shop-boy,"—"We dis∣posed of three last Week</Q>—I must own I felt no little Pleasure at the Author's Disappointment, as I look upon an Itch of Scandal to be the surest Sign of a de∣praved and malevolent Temper, and I am sorry to find that it is not always the Consequence of Hunger and Thirst. It ascends higher and flourishes in high Life, attends the Ladies at their Toilets, give a Relish to their Tea, a Flavour to their Liqueurs, and every Sum∣mer takes a Jant to <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> as constantly as a Gamester or a Citizen's Wife.</P>
<P>At the last mentioned Place I happened to spend a Week this Season, and was a Witness to the Mischief, which was occasioned by the polite Sonnetteers and Epigrammatists, who chuse to indulge their Wit, or rather, their Malice upon the amiable Sex. Both those who cannot write, and those who can, imme∣diately upon their Arrival in these Regions begin to measure out Syllables; the vain Poetaster, while in the Long-Room the Company sip Tea and Scandal, en∣vies not the Fame of <HI>Dryden, Pope,</HI> or <HI>Young;</HI> his Brow is adorned with a fancied Laurel, and he enjoys the Pangs he has excited in some lovely Bosom. As duly as the Morn returns, Malice flies abroad in the Form
<PB N="308" REF="319"/>of a <HI>Rebus,</HI> a <HI>Madrigal,</HI> a Song, an Epigram, or some such ingenious Shape. The general Curiosity is instantly excited, and every one is impatient to peruse the lying Evidence of Shame. <Q>Do, Colonel, shew it me —Captain <HI>Flimsy,</HI> can't you get me a Sight of it? Do, that's a Dear—Lord, Ma'am, an't it mighty —the Creature deserved it—What Airs she gave herself?—And such a deal of Talk, and so affected —Do you think her handsome?—Well, to be sure she wore a sweet Pair of Ruffles Yesterday.</Q>—</P>
<P>In this manner is dull Scandal helped about, and the more lovely and innocent the Person is, whose Hap∣piness is thus invaded, the more agreeable is the Invec∣tive; the Satyr sharpens, and the Wit refines. <HI>Musi∣dora</HI> has every Grace of Person, and every elegant Em∣bellishment of the Mind; in her Eye, to use the Expression of a fine Poet, <HI>Love ever wakes and keeps a vestal Fire,</HI> and her Behaviour carries with it an equal Degree of good Humour and Politeness, flowing from good Sense and a native Sweetness of Temper. <HI>Appius</HI> is aukward in his Person, and disagreeable in his Aspect; his Mind is ever on the fret, and, if engaged in a Country-Dance, he is dissatisfied with every Thing around him, and is eternally quarrelling with the Music. With these disagreeable Features of Body and Mind <HI>Appius</HI> applied to <HI>Musidora</HI> to be his Partner for the Evening, which she declined with great Affability and good Manners, having before experienced the Incon∣venience of the Foibles, which have taken Root in this Gentleman's Temper. <HI>Appius</HI> immediately took fire at the imagined Affront, and full of Indignation re∣tired home to his Lodging; there he, who never be∣fore attempted to tag a Rhyme, instantly commenced Poet, and the next Day came out the anonymous Stanza, which was however found out to be the Production of <HI>Appius.</HI> The Composition was declared very pretty by all the Prudes and Coquettes of the Place, both Spe∣cies
<PB N="309" REF="320"/>of Women being Enemies to <HI>Musidora,</HI> as she pre∣served a discreet Medium between a giddy Freedom on the one Hand, and the reserve of Hypocrisy on the other. The <HI>Verses</HI> were in a little Time in every body's Hand, and <HI>Appius</HI> was declared to have a very fine Turn for Poetry. The Effect, which this Treatment had on <HI>Musidora</HI>'s Mind, is not to be described; faded were the Roses which before were blended with the Lilly, and that Breast, which was designed for the Seat of Love, throbbed wild with uneasy Passions; to pre∣vent any further Vexation, her Relations were obliged in a Week's Time to fly from a Place, where Inno∣cence and Honour are sacrificed to a Jest; where the Men take a wanton Pleasure in Scandal, and where the Fair join in Combination against Truth and Virtue.</P>
<P>How People can thus become avowed Enemies to their own Happiness, and so universally adopt a Custom, which certainly would be more honoured in the Breach than the Observance, is to me highly unaccountable. It reminds me of the Licentiousness used by the Chorus in the Infancy of the Drama, when Malice was sub∣stituted in the room of Wit, and run a muck at ho∣nourable Families, until a salutary Law stopped the Proceeding, and the Chorus, deprived of all further Power of Offence, was condemned to ignominious Si∣lence.</P>
<Q><L>— Chorus{que}</L>
<L>Turpiter obticuit, sublato jure nocendi.</L>
<BIBL><HI>HOR.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P>If these ingenious Poetasters would reflect on the evil Consequences resulting from this Itch of Rhyming, I persuade myself this Gothic Piece of Pleasantry would be banished from all polite Places. I shall dismiss this Paper, after recommending to the Perusal of all <HI>Tun∣bridge</HI> Sonnetteers the following Lines of Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI>
<Q><L>Curs'd be the Verse, how well soe'er it flow,</L>

<L>That both Works were perform'd the very same Way;</L>
<L>That the Portal was Prologue to shew the Folks in;</L>
<L>That the Hall and the Entry open'd the Scene;</L>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG> Series of pointed <HI>Thoughts on various Sub∣jects</HI> has been put abroad into the World by several eminent Writers, and in <HI>France</HI> to this Day, it continues to be a favou∣rite Manner of conveying an Author's Sentiments to the Public. The famous <HI>Rochfoucault</HI> succeeded so well upon this Plan, that he is universally admired wherever Wit and Poignancy of Matter are relished. This Scheme of Writing indulges a free roving Exercise of the Mind, as Lord <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> expresses it; it sets us free from the Fatigue of pursuing a long and regular Tract of well∣concerted Reasoning, and may from its appearing in loose detached Sentences, seem to the Reader to carry with it no great Difficulty in the Execution, but it is nevertheless as hard as any other Vehicle of Instruction, as it raises a Demand for close Sense and a lively Turn
<PB N="312" REF="323"/>of Expression in almost every Line. Hence it is, that the Writer already mentioned has been so much cele∣brated by People of Taste, and hence it is, that <HI>Pope</HI> and <HI>Swift</HI> have thought proper to follow him in this Path of <HI>Satyr.</HI> A very ingenious <HI>French</HI> Writer has also published, within this short Time an entire Vo∣lume in this Way, abounding in excellent Reflections upon all Occurrences in Life, full of strong Sense, and highly spirited in the Diction. After having perused this Author, my Mind acquired such a Habit of think∣ing in this unconnected Fashion, that I could not settle my Thoughts on any one Topic for the Entertainment of my Readers.

<L>Othello <HI>rages, poor</HI> Monimia <HI>mourns,</HI></L>

<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>THOUGHTS ON VARIOUS SUBJECTS</HEAD>
<P>A Periodical Writer, in order to procure himself a sufficient Number of Readers, should endeavour to render his Works agreeable to the various Palates which predominate among the several Inhabitants of this Metropolis: But though he should season his Papers to the Taste in vogue, he should not entirely give up his own Judgment: As <HI>Cowley</HI> has it, The World may so come in a Man's Way, that he may salute it, but he should not go a whoring after it.</P>
<P>The severest Critics upon Writing are those who know the least of it, which is some Comfort to an Au∣thor, who lives in an Age of Envy, Malice, Ill-Nature and Detraction</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="324"/>Dean <HI>Swift</HI> tell us, that when he was a young Man, he believed that the Rest of the World resembled him∣self in talking of nothing but the last New Play: In this particular <HI>Ranger</HI> is perhaps too much like that great Genius.</P>
<P>When a Set of Booksellers are concerned in a News-Paper, a <HI>Monthly Review,</HI> or a <HI>Magazine,</HI> they take every Opportunity in the said Productions of praising the Works, in which they have a Property themselves, and of decrying every Thing that may prevent an In∣crease of their own Sale. Writers who are ill-used by them in this Shape, may enjoy always this Comfort, that were these People to <HI>poll</HI> in <HI>Parnassus,</HI> their Votes, upon a <HI>Scrutiny,</HI> would be struck off, as they are only <HI>Copyholders,</HI></P>
<P>You may know what a Gentleman thinks of you, by the Behaviour of his Servants, while they wait at Table. These People are always such sincere Friends to their Master, and, have his Honour and Glory so much at Heart, that they generally place their Affec∣tions and Resentments upon the same Object, unless their Judgment is handsomely bribed at the Street Door.</P>
<P>On the contrary, you may know what the Waiting-Maid thinks of you, by the Reception you meet with from her Mistress; for at present all young Ladies are directed in their Opinions concerning the Men by what Mrs. <HI>Betty</HI> is pleased to say at the Toilet, and if she declares, <Q>O Ma'am, he's a fine Man—I loves to see him like any Thing</Q>—or, <Q>Oh! the Fright —I hate the Sight of him.</Q> You are sure to find the Consequences of it, at the first Meeting.</P>
<P>As the World goes, there is generally more <HI>Art</HI> to obtain Success, than <HI>Merit</HI> to deserve it.</P>
<P>Sounding Periods and pompous Expressions no more constitute a beautiful Stile, than struting in <HI>Red Heel</HI> Shoes, and <HI>Gold Clock</HI> Stockings can make a graceful Walk; both may serve to impose upon the injudicious,
<PB N="314" REF="325"/>but those, who are acquainted with Men and Books, will always think Ease a very requisite Quality.</P>
<P>Discretion has its Bounds as well as all other Virtues; and it degenerates into a Vice, if, like <HI>Aaron</HI>'s Ser∣pent, it swallows up the rest.</P>
<P>A MOTTO for the <HI>JEWS;</HI></P>
<Q>—Nos alia ex aliis in Fata vocamur.</Q>
<P>When I reflect on the late <HI>Marriage-Act,</HI> I cannot help crying out with the Poet;</P>
<Q>Curse on all Laws, but those which Love has made.</Q>
<P>It is boldly remarked by a very good <HI>French</HI> Writer, that a King who does not keep a Mistress is highly esti∣mable, provided he does not become a Bigot through too much Devotion.</P>
<P>Politicians have observed, that <HI>England</HI> can never be undone but by a Parliament, if that be true, what are the Addresses from Candidates to their Electors, but so many Petitions to let them have a Hand in <HI>Naturali∣zation-Acts, Jew-Bills,</HI> Taxes, and in short the RUIN of their COUNTRY?</P>
<P>The surest Way of amassing overgrown Riches, is by a due Government or rather Suppression of a Man's own Passions, and artfully administering to the Grati∣fication of other People's.</P>
<P>It is much more difficult to HEAR in Company, than to SPEAK; Every one is willing to do the latter, but few have Politeness enough to do the former, though it serves a double Purpose; it shews our Manners at the same Time that it improves the Understanding.</P>
<P>The late Doctor <HI>Swift</HI> is not generally esteemed as a Man; in this Point the World agrees with the <HI>Dean</HI> himself, who was always mortified to think himself of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a Species.</P>
<P>Of at the Arguments in Favour of Vice, <HI>defendit</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, is the worst; who would chuse to travel in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Road, because it is crowded?</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="326"/>Every Age has a peculiar Characteristic to distinguish it; the last Century was remarkable for a comic Genius, which sometimes run out into unwarrantable Luxu∣riancies, and a Breach of Manners; the present Times have acquired a politer Taste but cannot produce any Work of Theatrical Humour. The former transgressed through an Excess of Vigour, the latter are decent, but they have that kind of Decency which arises from a Want of Power, rather than of Will, and should take for their Motto the Description of <HI>Eunuchs</HI> in <HI>Terence; Amatores esse eos maximos, sed nihil potesse.</HI></P>
<P>People of the same Profession frequently spend their Time in envying each other; whereas if they were ac∣tuated by <HI>Emulation,</HI> and each would mind his own Busi∣ness, every Man would find his Account in it; as at a Gaming-Table, the Way is not to be fretting at the Cards you suppose your Adversary may have, but to make the best of your own Hand.</P>
<P>Some People's Discretion is the Reverse of Charity; it covers a Multitude of Virtues, as the latter does a Multitude of Sins.</P>
<P>It was well said by a Gentleman at a Coffee-house, that the last Scene of a modern Tragedy is like a Sta∣tuary's Yard; the Players are all fixed in Attitudes.</P>
<P>When once a Writer is known, his Enemies all will rail at him, and his Friends will damn him with faint Praise, because he has dared to take the Lead of them. He fares like one who meets with speedy Preferment in the Army; the adverse Part will be sure to shoot at him, and his Brother-Officers will hate him for being put over their Heads.</P>
<P>Religion which should make us live in Peace and Charity, is the Source of our most violent Animosities, no one being willing to let his Neighbour worship the supreme Being according to his own Ideas, and his own Feelings, though each Person is resolved to usurp that Liberty himself.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="327"/>Lord <HI>Bolingbroke</HI> wrote against the Christian Religion; Doctor <HI>Hill</HI> intends to write against Lord <HI>Bolingbroke.

<Q><L>—Gratiae decentes</L>
<L>Alterno terram quatiunt pede—</L>
<BIBL><HI>HOR.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG> Celebrated <HI>French</HI> Critic has given it for a Rule, that every Author should from Time to Time <HI>sacrifice to the Graces;</HI> thereby beautifully insinuating, that Writers should endeavour to fashion their Minds into an elegant Way of Thinking, which will be always sure to transpire into their Compositions, and will be manifested by a de∣licate Choice of Sentiment and Expression. <HI>Inest fa∣cundis gratia dictis</HI> is the Phrase, by which an Author of Taste has signified a Polish and Refinement in a Per∣formance; and indeed among the Antients in general, it is this peculiar Grace, this genteel Manner of con∣ceiving and expressing their Thoughts, that has made their Productions the Admiration of Ages; and those have been accounted classic Writers among the Moderns, who have succeeded best in imitating the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Originals.</P>
<P>Full of these Reflections I retired to Rest a few Nights since, when, in the Hours of Sleep, my busy Imagina∣tion pursued the same Track of Contemplation, and pre∣sented to me the following Scene. I dreamt that an Order was issued out from the High Court of <HI>Parnassus</HI> requiring the immediate Attendance of all the Inhabi∣tants of the Place at a SACRIFICE TO THE GRACES, according to an anniversary Institution in Honour of the Day, on which <HI>Apollo</HI> slew the <HI>Python.</HI> For this Purpose the three lovely Sisters walked together, interchanging in their Way mutual Glances of Cordiality and Affec∣tion,
<PB N="318" REF="329"/>to an elegant Edifice raised by <HI>Inigo Jones;</HI> each had in her Hand Mr. <HI>Hogarth</HI>'s <HI>Analysis of Beauty.</HI> They placed themselves on an eminent Altar in such amiable Attitudes, as have not been equalled on any of our Theatres, since the Manager of <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> House withdrew a certain Lady from the publick Eye.</P>
<P>As soon as the <HI>Goddesses</HI> were thus prepared for the Solemnity, <HI>Apollo,</HI> in all the Pride of manly Beauty, ad∣vanced to the Altar, and paid his Adoration. This done, the Muses came forward in Procession, and, after prostrating themselves in a respectful Manner, they mixed together in a Dance, and sung Hymns of Praise in Honour of the Graces. <HI>Ducunt choreas, &amp; carmi∣na dicunt.</HI> The whole poetic Region was exhilerated at the Sound, and every Thing, that before looked beautiful, seemed to glow with additional Charms.</P>
<P>This Part of the Ceremony being concluded, a Trumpet sounded three Times, as a Signal for Men of Genius to make their Approach; and instantly a <HI>Grecian</HI> Band appeared. The most remarkable among them were <HI>Homer, Socrates, Plato, Sophocles,</HI> and <HI>Longi∣nus; Aristotle</HI> having sent Word that he was engaged in a <HI>Syllogism,</HI> and could not attend. <HI>Socrates,</HI> who, we are told, called Dancing a Sacrifice to the Graces, im∣mediately began a Movement before the Altar, and <HI>Plato</HI> ey'd him with a stedfast Look. <HI>Longinus,</HI> having acquitted himself in the due Forms of Veneration, fixed his Attention on <HI>Homer.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lucretius</HI> was Leader of the next Division; he thanked the <HI>Graces</HI> for having scattered so many Flowers amidst the Thorns, which shoot up in his Part of <HI>Parnassus. Terence,</HI> who was always an <HI>elegant Observer of Forms,</HI> seemed to receive great Delight from beholding so much Beauty, and he preferred his Prayer with the utmost Purity of Diction.</P>
<P>The Posture in which <HI>Tully</HI> placed himself recalled
<PB N="319" REF="330"/>to my Mind the Description of him in the <HI>Temple of Fame.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Gath'ring his flowing Robe he seem'd to stand,</L>
<L>In Act to speak, and graceful wav'd his Hand.</L></Q>
<P>He declared in a flowing Stile, that <Q>from an Ha∣bit of surveying the Beauty of external Objects, the Mind makes an easy Transition to the Fitness, the Order, and Regularity of its own inward Frame, and from a View of outward Decorum it begins to acquire the same Correctness and Elegance in its own Operations; studiously careful not to think or do any Thing unhandsomely, from whence results that <HI>Grace of Character,</HI> which is, in its very Nature, highly eligible and Praise worthy.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Virgil</HI> came forward with a modest Mien, and great Regularity in his Motion. He desired to pass all his Time with the <HI>Graces</HI> and the <HI>Muses;</HI> and bowing re∣spectfully thanked the <HI>Graces</HI> for that elegant Simpli∣city, the <HI>Molle atque facetum,</HI> which they had conferred upon him. He then retired to a laureat Shade, where he almost hid himself in illustrious Ease. <HI>Statius, Lucan,</HI> and <HI>Silius Italicus</HI> endeavoured to walk in the same Path after him, and sometimes they even aimed at his Footsteps, but an aukward Strut in their Gate ren∣dered it impracticable. The Goddesses told <HI>Ovid,</HI> that they were sorry they could not follow him into Exile. At the Approach of <HI>Horace, Venus,</HI> and all the laughing Loves, smiled with peculiar Pleasure. <HI>Tibullus</HI> was received with every Token of Affection, and, be∣fore he withdrew, he begged Leave to introduce Mr. <HI>Hammond</HI> to their Presence, which was granted, and accordingly Mr. <HI>Hammond</HI> had the Honour of kissing their Hands.</P>
<P>After this a Pause ensued in the Rites, occasioned by the Delay of several <HI>Monks</HI> and <HI>Fathers,</HI> to whom a Summon had been sent commanding their Attendance.
<PB N="320" REF="331"/>They were all in a Cluster at the Foot of <HI>Parnassus,</HI> and they at length returned for answer, that they did not chuse to worship false Deities. After such a Declara∣tion, it was with Surprize I beheld a certain <HI>Bishop</HI> lay aside his Mitre, and venerate the Pagan Goddesses.</P>
<P>Upon enquiring his Name, I found this Personage to be the celebrated <HI>Vida.</HI> He was followed by <HI>Eras∣mus, Strada, Bohours,</HI> and several <HI>Jesuits,</HI> who were at length joined by <HI>Boileou,</HI> and <HI>La Fontaine.</HI> The former had a Degree of Severity mixed in his Smiles, and the latter was all Quickness, Vivacity and Wit. In Imitation of <HI>Tibullus,</HI> they begged Leave to present their Friends, and accordingly, <HI>Garth, Prior,</HI> and <HI>Gay</HI> were introduced.</P>
<P><HI>Shakespear</HI> and <HI>Milton</HI> came down from the highest Eminence in <HI>Parnassus,</HI> to pay their Respects, but while they were performing their Duty, I observed they both raised their Heads to look at a Part of the Heavens, where there was a distant Thunder. <HI>Dryden</HI> had not Money to procure a sufficient Quantity of <HI>Frankincense,</HI> but the Graces accepted the Intention for the Deed, convinced by several Touches in his Works that no one had a finer Sense of Beauty. Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> advanced with his Eyes fixed upon <HI>Homer,</HI> who was then in Company with <HI>Virgil;</HI> his Look was thought∣ful, but bright, and he delivered himself in the most harmonious Numbers. <HI>Addison</HI> followed close at his Heels, and he acquitted himself in his peculiar Manner of giving good Sense all the Embellishments of Ease and artful Negligence. He observed how much Good, Humour added to the Beauty of the <HI>Graces,</HI> and he was pleased to see them without any fashionable Edifice of Hair on their Heads, and free from any enormous Circle of the Hoop.</P>
<P>By this Time a general Whisper began to run thro' all the Ranks, owing (as I soon perceived) to the Ap∣pearance of Dr. <HI>Swift,</HI> who approached with <HI>Cadenus</HI>
<PB N="321" REF="332"/>and <HI>Vanessa</HI> in his Hand, as an Offering to the Graces. As he drew nearer, he <HI>sucked in his Cheeks,</HI> and the God∣desses turned to each other with a Smile. Upon his ma∣king an Apology for some Strokes in his Works, they assured him that they could overlook those Singularities, on Account of his other admirable Qualities; and they added, that what was formerly granted to <HI>Virgil</HI> should be also allowed to him, <HI>viz. To toss about his Dung with an Air of Gracefulness.</HI></P>
<P>Lord <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> was ready to yield all Veneration to three Goddesses, who had always warmed his Fancy with the brightest Ideas. This noble Writer was suc∣ceeded by the Lord Viscount <HI>Bolingbroke,</HI> who by the Way declared himself an Enemy to all Forms of Worship. He avowed at the same Time, that he was readier to pay Adoration to those bright Existences, than to the <HI>God</HI> of <HI>Moses,</HI> or the <HI>God</HI> of <HI>Paul,</HI> on which Topics he ha∣rangued with a Roll of Periods, in which, tho' he did not advance the strict Truth, he deserved at least to be called, in the Words of a witty Satyrist, a <HI>polite Apostate from God's Grace to Wit.</HI></P>
<P>His Lordship withdrew, and I then perceived some certain modern Periodical Writers entering the Temple. They approached the Altar with a College Mien, and a pompous Affectation of learned Industry. Though no Charge could be brought against them for want of Matter, their Stile appeared too elaborate, and their Words frequently formed an <HI>exotic Dialect of adventitious Phrases,</HI> by which Means all Ease was discarded from their Writings; and where Ease is wanting, Grace will be always deficient.</P>
<P>Emboldened by the Example of my Brother Wri∣ters, methought, I approached the Altar, but I was told by <HI>Euphrosyne,</HI> that I advanced with rather too great an Air of Negligence, and the Goddess advised me to avoid the Appearance of Thoughtlessness, while I en∣deavoured to be easy and graceful. I was so stung with
<PB N="322" REF="333"/>this Reproach, that my Repose was instantly disturbed, and, when awakened, I pleased myself in the Re∣flection that the whole was but a Dream.</P>

<Q><L>— Felix, qui tempora quivit</L>

<L>Mutati donec redeat clementia coeli.</L>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Author, from whom I have selected the Motto of this Day's Paper, was a Poet of great Elegance, as well as a Critic of the most refined Taste. He observes in his excellent <HI>Art of Poetry,</HI> that the Genius of Writers is frequently very unequal, their Vigour often exhausted, and their Spirits sunk; as if <HI>Apollo</HI> and the Muses had quite abandoned the tuneful Breast; and therefore he advises every Author, to call off his Mind at proper Seasons from the Studies he is employed in, in order to wait more propitious Moments, when the Return of the poetic Heat, and the Influence of the God, may render his Productions more animated.</P>
<P>This Precept certainly should be adhered to by all, who presume to lay their Lucubrations before the Pub∣lic; but it often happens, that the periodical Essayist, however inclined he may be to retouch and finish, is compelled by Necessity to dismiss the uncorrected Sheet to the Press; for though the Town may think they have a Right to an Author's whole Time, and that he should grow pale at the Midnight Lamp, the better to make a Part of their Tea-Equipage in a Morning, it cannot but often be the Case, that Business of some Sort, social Connections, and sundry various Avoca∣tions
<PB N="324" REF="335"/>shall obtrude themselves, so as to render it im∣possible for a Writer to comply with that Respect he owes his Readers: for, as it has been wittily said by Sir <HI>Richard Steel,</HI> an Adventurer in this Way, is like a Man who keeps a Stage-Coach; he must set out, whe∣ther there are Passengers or not.</P>
<P>I have sometimes, since the Commencement of the <HI>Gray's Inn Journal,</HI> been curious after my own Fame, and on this Account I have often seated myself in a snug Part of a Coffee-house, in Order to collect the Sentiments of the Public concerning the present Wri∣ter. Upon these Occasions I have observed, that no Allowance is made for a temporary Want of Health, an accidental Depression of Spirits, to which all Men are liable at Times; and I must add, that it is not com∣mon for Readers in Coffee houses to make any Abate∣ment of their Severity, on Account of the Humour they may be in themselves, their own want of Ease, and their usual Cheerfulness. I remember to have been damned by a well looking Man, because his Wine was bad the Night before, and the Fumes of it were still in his Head; an uxorious Gentleman, who is sometimes a little Henpecked by his Wife, is sure never to relish me after a Curtain-Lecture; and the Price of Corn at <HI>Bear-Key</HI> has more than once lowered me in the Esti∣mation of a solid Citizen. Add to these accidental Con∣tingencies, the great Variety of Tasles, which prevall in every Company, and which it is a moral Impossibi∣lity for any Writer to gratify at once. I have occasionally entertained the Town with Essays of Pleasantry and Humour, and the Consequence is, that it has raised a Demand upon me every <HI>Saturday</HI> for an equal Vein of Mirth. Because the <HI>Temple of Laverna</HI> has excited a general Laugh, it is asked upon entering a Coffee-room, <Q>Waiter, has Mr. <HI>Ranger</HI> given us any more de∣tached Scenes to Day?" "Is there any Thing im∣mensly high?" "O! this is against Suicide, there
<PB N="325" REF="336"/>is no Fun here,</Q> says another; and a third exclaims, <Q>Pshaw! this Man is always laughing—can't he be serious a little, and give us something that has Stuff in it—Essays on Taste, and Poets, and Humourists, and Monkeys, and Stile! Here, Boy, give me the <HI>Gazetteer;</HI> or the <HI>London-Daily Advertiser,</HI> which ever is out of Hand.</Q>—A Correspondent, who writes to me from his House near <HI>Litchfield,</HI> begs to know, why I have entirely discarded Politics, and has the follow∣ing Paragraph—<Q>Why won't you have a Fling at the Times?—A Touch now and then upon the Mi∣nistry, and a Stricture upon the Constitution would have a pretty go down with us in the Country.</Q></P>
<P>As it is now considently afferted that the <HI>Jew-Bill</HI> will be repealed, I have resolved with myself to be a Tool to no Party whatever, and as to the Care of our Constitution, I heartily recommand it to those, who are entrusted with it.</P>
<P>"Videant Consules, ucquid detrimenti Res Publica capiat."</P>
<P>This Paper was undertaken to contribute, as far as the Author's Time and Abilities would permit him, to the Entertainment or Instruction of his Readers; to laugh out of Countenance many of those Foibles, which are apt to shoot up in this Metropolis; to amuse the Fair, to promote Decency and good Manners, and to detect Impostors in Writing, Criticism, and many Situa∣tions of Life. That this has succeeded far beyond his warmest Hopes, he is not backward to acknowledge; he thinks himself obliged to his candid Readers for the savourable Reception, they have hitherto been pleased to afford to the Production of his leisure Hours, and, though he is not inclinable to arrogate to himself any Vanity on this Head, he is notwithstanding pleased, in a particular Degree, to find that this, his first Attempt, has gone on with growing Reputation, from the first Out set, to this present <HI>Saturday,</HI> without anticipating
<PB N="326" REF="337"/>the public Favour by Pusss in the News-Papers, or by the Address of Emissaries, who should considently as∣sert, that it was to be the joint Labour and Production of some of the best Writers of the Age; without a Combination of Booksellers to support it by a Subscrip∣tion, and without the Patronage of any great Man what∣ever. The Author always disdained such little Arti∣sices, well knowing, that if he had any Wit to recom∣mend him, the Public would return a Degree of Encou∣ragement in Proportion to their Entertainment; and on this Account; he has never been so industrious to insi∣nuate, that a very eminent Hand was engaged; that Sir <HI>Gecrge</HI> ***** wrote such an Essay; that my Lord ***** diverted the Choice Spirits such a Day; that the last was very sine, and came from the Honour∣able *****; that the Author of ***** contri∣buted the exquisite Entertainment in such a Piece, and that Mr. ***** the Translator of ***** was certainly one of the Gentlemen concerned in it, and that his Stile could be easily traced in the respective Pieces belonging to him.</P>
<P>Without these Advantages, the <HI>Gray's-Inn Journal</HI> has found the Way to amuse the Town once a Week for twelve Months past, and, I may boast, with perhaps sewer voluntary Supplies than is generally afforded to Authors on these Occasions.—However, as I am not inclined to assume to myself any <HI>Praise,</HI> that my own Conviction does not tell me, is properly mine, I must here let the Public know that there is a Person, to whom I am frequently obliged for all the Assistance he can contribute. I shall not mention his Name, as I am persuaded, it would not be agreeable to one of his Mo∣desty and delicate Sense of Things; thus much I will hint, that this Personage is no other than the Compo∣sitor of the Press, who, finding that my Occupations will not permit me to revise the Paper myself, is kind enough upon several Occasions to alter Words and Sen∣tences
<PB N="327" REF="338"/>according to his own Taste, and whenever a Phrase does not entirely please him, the Reader, is sure to see something substituted in its room; for Instance, I had Occasion to mention some Time since, <HI>a Treaty of Marriage,</HI> which this Gentleman converted into a <HI>Treatise of Marriage,</HI> and the Reader's own Obser∣vation will point out to him several Elegancies of this Nature upon other Occasions; all which Embellish∣ments of Stile, I beg, may be invariably attributed to the abovementioned Compositor of the Press, of whom I shall say no more at present; but as the Printer's Devil is now with me for this Lucubration, I shall conclude with a Return of my sincere Thanks to the Public, for the Encouragement they have afforded me during the Course of this Volume, with a grateful Sense of which I here take my Leave, and remain un∣til next <HI>Saturday,</HI> the candid Readers,</P>
