<HEAD><HI>To Mr.</HI> GARRICK.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE UPHOLSTERER would be a <HI>Bankrupt</HI> even in thanks, could he think of going abroad into the World, without making his Com∣pliments to Mr. <HI>Garrick,</HI> for the Civilities he has shewn him. Whatever Figure the poor broken Politician might make before the Commissioners of Bankruptcy at <HI>Guild-hall,</HI> you have taken care of his Appearance before the self-chosen Commission∣ers of Criticism, at the Theatre Royal, in <HI>Drury-Lane.</HI></P>
<P>I am not willing to flatter myself that you were drawn forth, on this occasion, by any extra∣ordinary Touches in the capital Figure, or in the <HI>Accompagnements du Tableau.</HI> I rather suppose that you approved the Justness of the Design, than that you were an Admirer of the Colouring.</P>
<P>The Design, Sir, was conceived and executed long since, because the Author judged that some∣thing in this way might have a seasonable tendency to allay the Intemperance of too violent a Political Spirit, or at least to laugh it into good Humour: With the same view it was lately retouched, and given to Mr. <HI>Mossop,</HI> to be presented to the Pub∣lic at his Benefit. And however Men of a serious Cast may depreciate Amusements of this nature, I shall never blush for having dedicated a few Hours to them, as I am of opinion that such-like Avocations will more profitably unbend the Mind from graver Studies, than the solitary Pleasures of the Recluse, or any of the more open Dissipations of Life.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="3"/>
I am aware that you, will, very probably, recol∣lect a Passage in a celebrated Writer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Montesquicu.</HI></NOTE>, which may seem to render the scope of this little Piece somewhat questionable. <Q><HI>Dans une Nation Libre</HI></Q> saith he, <Q><HI>Il est tres Souvent indiferent que les Par∣ticuliers Raisonnets bien ou mal il sufit qu'ils Raison∣nent: de la sort la Liberte qui Garantit des Ef∣fets de ces memes Raisonnements.</HI></Q> But you know that the Question here, is not concerning the in∣disputable Right of the People to canvass their national Concerns; but the vicious Excess of a propensity to Politics, when it gives a wrong Bias to the Mind, and is attended with Circum∣stances, which create the ridiculous Absurd. In this light it was considered by Mr. <HI>Addison,</HI> who tells us in the <HI>Tatler,</HI> <NOTE N="|" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide Number</HI> 155. <HI>and</HI> 160.</NOTE> that he designed his Paper <Q>for the Benefit of those Citizens, who live more in a Coffee-house, than in their Shops, and whose Thoughts are so taken up with the Af∣fairs of the Allies, that they forget their Cus∣tomers.</Q> For the very same Species of People, the <HI>Upholsterer</HI> was brought on the Stage, being perhaps as proper an Object of Ridicule, as mo∣dern I de as and Manners will afford.</P>
<P>With regard to the Execution, I shall not detain you any longer on that head, than to remark that to preserve the Gravity, which is a specific Quality in Mr. <HI>Addison</HI>'s fine vein of Humour, has been my Endeavour throughout the Whole; though I am not insensible that grave Humour is sometimes dangerous on the Stage. In the principal Charac∣ter I considered myself rather describing a <HI>Passion</HI> than a <HI>Man;</HI> and this you remember is mentioned by an excellent Critic, <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Hurd.</HI></NOTE> to belong to the Province of Farce. For this Reason the UPHOLSTERER'S
<PB N="iii" REF="4"/>
Scenes are strongly tinctured with his predominant Foible; and as this Foible is generally fed and inflamed by a swarm of political Writers, I judged it coincident with my Plan, to expose the Duplicity of their Conduct, by introducing the Character of PAMPHLET.</P>
<P>This Character I have had the pleasure of seeing set off with all the exquisite Strokes of so fine a Comic Genius as Mr. GARRICK'S, without being indebted for Success to the Aid of personal Satire, having entirely levelled it against those, who are the ready Mercenaries of all Parties; and with all such I have the Happiness not to be acquainted.</P>
<P>I could here enlarge in the just Praise of Mr. <HI>Woodward,</HI> Mr. <HI>Yates,</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Clive, &amp;c.</HI> but I have already deviated too far from the Purpose, I set out with; which was not to inscribe a Farce to you, for neither of us thinks so highly of these Mat∣ters; nor to become your Panegyrist, for your ex∣tended Reputation does not stand in need of it. My Intention was to embrace a public Opportu∣nity of subscribing myself.</P>

<P>Fortune not to be minded!—I'll tell you what <HI>Bellmour,</HI> tho' you have a good one already, there's no kind of In∣convenience in a little more,—I'm sure if I had not minded Fortune, I might have been in <HI>Jamaica</HI> still, not worth a Sugar-Cane; but the Widow <HI>Molosses</HI> took a Fancy to me;—Heaven, or a worse Destiny has taken a Fancy to her, and so after ten Years Exile, and being turn'd a-drist by my Father, here am I again a warm Planter, and a Widower, most woefully tir'd of Matrimony;—but my dear <HI>Bellmour</HI> we were both so overjoy'd to meet one another yesterday Evening, just as I arriv'd in Town, that I did not hear a Syllable from you of your Love Fit: How, when, and where did this happen?</P>

<SPEAKER>ROVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, a new Man indeed!—Who in the Name of Won∣der would take thee, sunk as thou art into a musing, moping, melancholy Lover, for the gay <HI>Charles Bellmour</HI> whom I knew in the <HI>West-Indies?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poh, that is not mentioned,—you know my Father took me against my Will from the University, and con∣signed me over, to the academic Discipline of a Man of War; so chat to prevent a Dejection of Spirits, I was oblig'd to run into the opposite Extreme,—as you yourself were wont to do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, yes, I had my Moments of Reflection, and was glad to dissipate them—You know I always told you there was something extraordinary in my Story; and so there is still, I suppose it must be cleared up in a few Days now—I'm in no Hurry about it tho'; I must see the Town a lit∣tle this Evening, and have my Frolic first. But to the Point <HI>Bellmour,</HI> you was going from the Tavern you say.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Yes, Sir, about two in the Morning, and I perceiv'd an unusual Blaze in the Air,—I was in a rambling Humour, and so resolv'd to know what it was.</P>

<P>Oh! <HI>Rovewell!</HI> my better Stars ordain'd it to light me on to Happiness;—by sure Attraction led, I came to the very Street where a House was on Fire; Water-Engines playing, Flames ascending, all Hurry, Confusion, and Distress; when on a sudden the Voice of Despair, Sil∣ver sweet, came thrilling down to my very Heart;—poor,
<PB N="6" REF="13"/>
dear, little Soul, what can she do, cried the Neighbours? Again she scream'd, the Fire gathering Force, and gaining upon her every Instant;—here Ma'am said I, leap into my Arms, I'll be sure to receive you;—and wou'd you think it?—down she came,—my dear <HI>Rovewell,</HI> such a Girl!—I caught her in my Arms you Rogue, safe, without Harm.—The dear naked <HI>Venus,</HI> just risen from her Bed, my Boy,—her slender Waist <HI>Rovewell,</HI> the downy Smooth∣ness of her whole Person, and her Limbs <Q>harmonious, swell'd by Nature's softest Hand.</Q>—</P>

<P>Raptures, and Paradise!—What Seraglio in <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> did you carry her to?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELL</SPEAKER>
<P>There again now! Do, prithee correct your Way of Thinking, take a <HI>quantum sufficit</HI> of virtuous Love, and purify your Ideas.—Her lovely Bashfulness, her delicate Fears,—her Beauty heighten'd and endear'd by Distress, dispers'd my wildest Thoughts, and melted me into Ten∣derness and Respect.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But <HI>Bellmour,</HI> surely she has not the Impudence to be modest after you have had Possession of her Person.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Views are honourable I assure you, Sir; but her Fa∣ther is so absurdly positive.—The Man's distracted about the Balance of Power, and will give his Daughter to none but a Politician.—When there was an Execution in his House, he thought of nothing but the Camp at <HI>Pyrna,</HI> and now he's a Bankrupt, his Head runs upon Ways and Means, and Schemes for paying off the national Debt: The Affairs of Europe engross all his Attention, while the Distresses of his lovely Daughter pass unnoticed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ridiculous enough!—But why do you mind him? Why don't you go to Bed to the Wench at once?—Take her into Keeping Man.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can you talk so affrontingly of her?—Have not I

told you tho' her Father is ruin'd, still she has great Ex∣pectancies from a rich Relation?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then what do you stand watering at the Mouth for? If she is to have Money enough to pay for her China, her Gaming Debts, her Dogs, and her Monkeys, marry her then, if you needs must be ensnar'd; be in a Fool's Paradise for a Honey-Moon, then come to yourself, won∣der at what you've done, and mix with honest Fellows again;—carry her off I say, and never stand whining for the Father's Consent.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Carry her off!—I like the Scheme,—will you assist me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, there I beg to be excus'd. Don't you remember what the Satyrist says,—<Q>Never marry while there's a Halter to be had for Money, or a Bridge to afford a convenient Leap.</Q></P>

<P>Not uneasy! If the Papists should beat the Protestants—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CODIC.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I tell you, they can get no Advantage of us. The Laws against the further Growth of Popery will secure us—there are Provisoes in Favour of Protestant Purchasers under Papists—10th <HI>Geo.</HI> I. Cap. 4 and 6 <HI>Geo.</HI> II. Cap. 5.</P>

<P>Can't they?</P>

<P>No, they can set up no Claim—If the Queen on her Marriage had put all her Lands into <HI>Hotchpot</HI> then indeed—and it seemeth saith <HI>Littleton,</HI> that this Word <HI>Hotchpot</HI> is in <HI>English</HI> a Pudding—</P>

</SP>
<SP>

<P>Nor does the Matter rest here; for how can she set up a Claim, when she has made a Conveyance to the House of <HI>Brandenburgh?</HI> the Law, Mr. <HI>Quidnunc</HI> is very severe against fraudulent Conveyances—</P>

<SP>

<P>S'bodikins, you have satisfied me—</P>
