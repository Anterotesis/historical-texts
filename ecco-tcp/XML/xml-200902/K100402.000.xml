<P>But, my Gratitude prompts me to declare the Obligations I have to my Best and Dearest Friend
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>
Mr. <HI>Aaron Hill,</HI> for his many judi∣cious Corrections in this Tragedy. On that <HI>worthy Gentleman</HI> (whose Mind is enrich'd with every noble Science, and in whose Breast all the Virtues of Humanity are comprised) it will be my Pride, to offer my Sentiments, in a more distinguishing Manner here∣after.</P>
<P>I think it my Duty also, to return Thanks to the Town, for their fa∣vourable Reception of this Play; and for the Applause their Indulgence be∣stow'd on the Performance of the <HI>Young Actors:</HI> Particularly for my own Success, in a double Capacity, as <HI>Actor,</HI> and <HI>Author;</HI> I shall ever <HI>pub∣lickly</HI> confess <HI>their Generosity,</HI> as it will ever prove <HI>my secret Satisfac∣tion.</HI></P>
<P>Notwithstanding the Disadvantage this Play may have received, in the Representation, I cannot omit acknow∣ledging a Debt of <HI>Gratitude</HI> to
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>
Mr. <HI>Theophilus Cibber,</HI> who was very careful in the Management of the Rehearsals, and endeavour'd to in∣struct every one concern'd in the Play; a Mechanism, which my Inexperience, as an <HI>Actor,</HI> made me incapable of.</P>
<P>Tho' an <HI>Author</HI> knows the Mean∣ing of his Scenes, he may be unac∣quainted with a <HI>Theatrical</HI> Method, of setting 'em in the most advanta∣geous Appearance. <HI>Example enforces Precept:</HI> and therefore Mr. <HI>Cibber junior,</HI> took the noblest Method, to improve others, by doing Justice to his own Character; and, tho' he la∣bours under the present Disadvantage of small Stature, I can't help concur∣ring with the Opinion of many others, that, in <HI>Action,</HI> and <HI>Elocution,</HI> he is certainly a <HI>Prodigy.</HI></P>
