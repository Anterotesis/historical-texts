<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS work is composed from the ob∣servations of perhaps half my life, made without the lest original view of publication, from the numberless walks taken in and about our capital, with a mind occupied with more ideas than the frivolous visit, or the mere object of the hour.</P>
<P>SOME were made in company of different friends, stricken, like myself, with the love of the science of antiquities; and with the desire of tracing the progress of perhaps the first city (comparing all its advantages) in the universe.</P>
<P>THE remarks made in these latter walks
<PB N="iv" REF="4"/>
were committed to my tablets till they became rather considerable. In that state I determined to lay them before the public, not urged by <HI>desire</HI> of friends, nor the <HI>wish</HI> of the people, or any similar motives, but by my own continued propensity to writing.</P>
<P>I HAVE two things to apologize for in this performance. First, its irregularity: but I do assure my friends it is given nearly in the same manner in which the materials were collected, and quite according to the course of the walk of the day.</P>
<P>Secondly, Let me request the good inhabi∣tants of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Westminster,</HI> not to be offended at my having stuffed their <HI>Iliad</HI> into a nut-shell: the account of the city of <HI>London,</HI> and liberties of <HI>Westminster,</HI> into a <HI>quarto</HI> volume. I have condensed into it all I could; omitted nothing that suggested itself, nor am∣plified
<PB N="v" REF="5"/>
any thing <HI>to make it a guinea book.</HI> In a word, it is done in my own manner, from which I am grown too old to depart.</P>
<P>I FEEL within myself a certain monitor that warns me to hang up my pen in time, before its powers are weakened, and rendered visibly impaired. I wait not for the admonition of friends. I have the archbishop of <HI>Grenada</HI> in my eye: and fear the imbecility of human nature might produce, in long-worn age, the same treatment of my kind advisers, as poor <HI>Gil Blas</HI> had from his most reverend patron. My literary bequests to future times, and more serious concerns, must occupy the remnant of my days. This closes my public labors.</P>
<P>To every particular friend and correspondent I send my most cordial thanks, for their candid and unremitted attention to my various enqui∣ries: and for their bearing so long with my
<PB N="vi" REF="6"/>
yearning after information; and with my un∣common curiosity, without which no writer can proceed with the confidence of accuracy, or ought to lay any thing before the public unsanctioned by local information. So much for acknowlegement of private favors.—I take leave of a partial public, with the truest grati∣tude for its long endurance of my very volumi∣nous writings: for its kind fostering my few merits: for its affected blindness to my nume∣rous defects. The last act concluded!</P>

<HEAD>OF LONDON.</HEAD>
<P>WHENSOEVER a party of the original inhabitants of this island found an impulse towards civilization;<NOTE PLACE="marg">ESTABLISHMENT OF A BRITISH TOWN.</NOTE> to withdraw from their native dens in depth of woods, and to form society; they cleared a spot in the midst of their fo∣rests, and founded their towns, similar to those which the first dis∣coverers of the new world met with occupied by the savages of <HI>America</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>De Brie's Virginia,</HI> tab. xix. xx.</NOTE>; similar to, but probably inferior in oeconomy to those of the more polished race of <HI>Pholey Negroes</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Moore's</HI> Travels into <HI>Africa,</HI> 26.</NOTE> of <HI>Guinea.</HI> The <HI>Britons</HI> soon found the danger of living in families separated and undefended. They sought for security in places surrounded with woods or morasses, and added to the natural strength by forming ramparts and sinking fosses <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Oppidum autem <HI>Britanni</HI> vocant quum sylvas impeditas vallo atque fossa munierunt. <HI>Caesar. de Bel. Gal.</HI> lib. v.—Locum egregiè et naturâ et opere muni∣tum. <HI>Ibid. Strabo,</HI> lib. iv. p. 306.</NOTE>. But they preferred spots fortified by nature; and made artificial works only where
<PB N="2" REF="10"/>
nature shewed herself deficient. Within such precincts they formed their towns; their buildings were most mean and simple, covered with reeds or sticks like <HI>American</HI> wigwams, or like modern hovels of the peasants of <HI>Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>haber,</HI> or the cabins of the <HI>Irish</HI> commonalty, to this moment as rude as the <HI>British</HI> abori∣gines. To these precincts the <HI>Britons</HI> resorted with their cattle, their wives and children <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dioderus Siculus,</HI> lib. v. c. 11.</NOTE>, whom they left thus protected, while they sallied out to war, or to the employments of the chace: for their cloathing was the skins of beasts, and their food the flesh, with the addition of milk, and farinaceous diet. The <HI>Britons</HI> soon became acquainted with one great use of the cow, notwith∣standing they remained ignorant of the making of cheese till the arrival of the <HI>Romans.</HI> Agriculture was soon introduced among those who earliest formed towns or communities: possibly by strangers who visited them from the continent. They cleared the land in the neighborhood of their dwellings, they sowed corn, they reaped and deposited it in granaries under ground, as the <HI>Sicilians</HI> practise to this very day; but the latter lodged it in the grain, our predecessors in the ear, out of which they picked the grains as they wanted them, and, ignorant of mills, at first bruised, and then made them into a coarse bread<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Conjuges et liberos in loca tuta transferrent. <HI>Tacitus in vit. Agric.</HI></NOTE>. The same nation who taught them the art of agriculture, first introduced a change of dress. From the <HI>Gauls</HI> of the continent, they received the first cloth; the dress called the <HI>Bracha,</HI> a coarse woollen manu∣facture. But probably it was long before they learned the use of the loom, or became their own manufacturers. This intercourse
<PB N="3" REF="11"/>
layed the foundation of commerce, which in early times extended no farther than to our maritime places. <HI>They</HI> first received the rudiments of civilization, while the more remote remained, in proportion to their distance, more and more savage, or in a state of nature. In the same degree as the neighboring <HI>Gauls</HI> be∣came acquainted with the arts, they communicated them to the nearest <HI>British</HI> colonists; who, derived from the same stock, and retaining the same language and manners, were more capable and willing to receive any instructions offered by a congenerous peo∣ple. For this reason <HI>Cantium,</HI> the modern <HI>Kent,</HI> and probably the country for some way up the <HI>Thames,</HI> was, as <HI>Caesar</HI> informs us, far the most civilized of any part of <HI>Britain:</HI> and that the inha∣bitants differed very little in their manner of life from the <HI>Gauls.</HI> It was from the merchants who frequented our ports, he received the first intelligence of the nature of our country, which induced him to undertake the invasion of <HI>Britain,</HI> and which in after∣times layed the foundation of its conquest by the <HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is not the lest reason to doubt but that <HI>London</HI> existed at that period, and was a place of much resort.<NOTE PLACE="marg">LONDON.</NOTE> It stood in such a situation as the <HI>Britons</HI> would select, according to the rule they established. An immense forest originally extended to the river side, and even as late as the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> II. covered the north∣ern neighborhood of the city, and was filled with various species of beasts of chace <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fitzstephen's Descr. London, <HI>26.</HI></NOTE>. It was defended naturally by fosses; one formed by the creek which ran along <HI>Fleet-ditch,</HI> the other, afterwards known by that of <HI>Walbrook.</HI> The south side was
<PB N="4" REF="12"/>
guarded by the <HI>Thames.</HI> The north they might think sufficiently protected by the adjacent forest.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">LONDON STONE.</NOTE>NEAR <HI>St. Swithin's</HI> church is a remnant of antiquity, which some have supposed to have been <HI>British;</HI> a stone, which might have formed a part of a <HI>Druidical</HI> circle, or some other object of the antient religion, as it is placed near the center of the <HI>Ro∣man</HI> precincts. Others have conjectured it to have been a milli∣ary stone, and to have served as a standard, from which they began to compute their miles. This seems very reasonable, as the dis∣tances from the neighboring places coincide very exactly. At all times it has been preserved with great care, was placed deep in the ground, and strongly fastened with bars of iron. It seems preserved like the <HI>Palladium</HI> of the city. It is at present cased like a relique, within free-stone, with a hole left in the middle, which discovers the original. Certainly superstitious respect had been payed to it; for when the notorious rebel <HI>Jack Cade</HI> passed by it, after he had forced his way into the city, he struck his sword on <HI>London stone,</HI> saying, "Now is <HI>Mortimer</HI> lord of this citie <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Holinshed,</HI> 634.</NOTE>;" as if that had been a customary ceremony of taking possession.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">WHEN FOUNDED.</NOTE>THERE is every reason to suppose that the <HI>Romans</HI> possessed themselves of <HI>London</HI> in the reign of <HI>Claudius;</HI> under whom <HI>Au∣lus Plautius</HI> took <HI>Camalcdunum,</HI> the present <HI>Maldon,</HI> in <HI>Essex,</HI> and planted there a colony, consisting of veterans of the four∣teenth legion, about a hundred and five years after the first inva∣sion of our island by <HI>Caesar.</HI> This was the first footing the <HI>Ro∣mans</HI> had in <HI>Britain.</HI> It seems certain that <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Verulam</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="13"/>
were taken possession of about the same time; but the last clames the honor of being of a far earlier date, more opulent, populous, and a royal seat before the conquest of <HI>Britain. Camalodunum</HI> was made a <HI>Colonia,</HI> or a place governed entirely by <HI>Roman</HI> laws and customs; <HI>Verulamium,</HI> a <HI>Municipium,</HI> in which the natives were honored with the privileges of <HI>Roman</HI> citizens, and enjoyed their own laws and constitutions; and <HI>Londinium,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ONLY A PRAEFECTURA.</NOTE> only a <HI>Praefec∣tura,</HI> the inhabitants, a mixture of <HI>Romans</HI> and <HI>Britons,</HI> being suffered to enjoy no more than the name of citizens of <HI>Rome,</HI> being governed by <HI>Praefects</HI> sent annually from thence, without having either their own laws or magistrates. It was even then of such concourse, and such vast trade, that the wise conquerors did not think fit to trust the inhabitants with the same privileges as other places, of which they had less reason to be jealous.</P>
<P>THERE is no mention of this important place, till the reign of <HI>Tiberius;</HI> when <HI>Tacitus</HI> speaks of it as not having been distin∣guished as a colony, but famous for its great concourse of mer∣chants, and its vast commerce: this indicates, at lest, that <HI>London</HI> had been at that time of some antiquity as a trading town. The exports from hence were cattle, hides, and corn; dogs made a small article; and, let me add, that slaves were a considerable object. Our internal parts were on a level with the <HI>African</HI> slave coasts; and wars among the petty monarchs were promoted for the sake of a traffic now so strongly controverted <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Strabo,</HI> lib. iv. p. 265.</NOTE>. The imports were at first salt, earthen ware, and works in brass,<NOTE PLACE="marg">IMPORTS.</NOTE> polished bits of bones emulating ivory, horse-collars, toys of am∣ber, and glasses, and other articles of the same material <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The same, p. 307.</NOTE>. We
<PB N="6" REF="14"/>
need not insist on the commerce of this period, for there was a great trade carried on with the <HI>Gauls</HI> in the days of <HI>Caesar:</HI> that celebrated invader assigning, as his reason for attempting this island, the vast supplies which we gave to his <HI>Gaulish</HI> enemies <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Bell. Gall.</HI> lib. iv.</NOTE>, and which interrupted his conquests on the continent.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">WHEN FIRST MENTIONED.</NOTE>THE first mention of <HI>London</HI> was occasioned by a calamity, in the year 61, in the reign of <HI>Nero,</HI> which nearly occasioned the extinction of the <HI>Roman</HI> power in <HI>Britain.</HI> The heroine <HI>Bo∣adicia,</HI> indignant at the personal insult offered to her and her family, and the cruelties of the conquerors to the unhappy <HI>Bri∣tons,</HI> made a sudden revolt, and destroyed <HI>Camolodunum,</HI> after putting all the colonists to the sword. <HI>Tacitus</HI> gives us the pre∣diction of the ruin of that city, with all the majesty of historical superstition.
<Q>Nulla palàm causa delapsum <HI>Camaloduni</HI> simu∣lacrum victoriae, ac retro conversum, quasi cederet hostibus. Et foeminae in furore turbatae, adesse exitium canebant.

<P>THE <HI>Roman</HI> general <HI>Paulinus Suetonius,</HI> on this news, suddenly marched across the kingdom, from his conquests in <HI>North Wales,</HI> to <HI>London;</HI> which, finding himself unequal to defend with his small army, he evacuated to the fury of the enemy, after rein∣forcing his troops with all the natives who were fit to serve. Neither the tears nor prayers of the inhabitants could prevale on
<PB N="7" REF="15"/>
him to give them his protection.<NOTE PLACE="marg">DESTROYED BY THE BRITON<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> The enraged <HI>Boadicia</HI> destroy∣ed all who continued behind. <HI>Verulamium</HI> met with the same fate. In all the three places seventy thousand <HI>Romans</HI> and <HI>Bri∣tish</HI> allies perished<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tac. Annales,</HI> lib. xiv. c. 33.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>Romans</HI> became masters of <HI>London,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ENLARGED BY THE ROMANS.</NOTE> they enlarged the precincts, and altered their form. It extended in length from <HI>Ludgate-hill</HI> to a spot a little beyond the <HI>Tower.</HI> The breadth was not half equal to the length, and at each end grew considerably narrower. Mr. <HI>Maitland</HI> suspects that the walls were not built till a very late period of the empire, and that it was an open town; because the city happened to be surprized,<NOTE PLACE="marg">LONG AN OPEN TOWN.</NOTE> in the days of <HI>Dioclesian</HI> and <HI>Maximilian,</HI> by a party of banditti, who were cut off by a band of <HI>Roman</HI> soldiers, who fortunately had, at the very time they were engaged in the plunder, come up the river in a fog. The time in which the wall was built is very un∣certain. Some ascribe the work to <HI>Constantine</HI> the great.<NOTE PLACE="marg">WHEN WALLED.</NOTE> <HI>Mait∣land,</HI> to <HI>Theodosius,</HI> governor of <HI>Britain</HI> in 369. As to the last, we know no more, than that, after he had cleared the coun∣try of the barbarians, he redressed grievances, strengthened the garrisons, and repaired the cities and forts <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ammianus Marcellinus,</HI> lib. xxviii. c. 3.</NOTE> which had been damaged. If <HI>London</HI> was among those, it certainly im∣plies a prior fortification. Possibly their founder might have been <HI>Constantine,</HI> as numbers of coins of his mother <HI>Helena</HI> have been discovered under them placed there by him in compliment to her. To support this conjecture, we may strengthen it by saying, that in honor of this empress, the city, about that time,
<PB N="8" REF="16"/>
received from her the title of <HI>Augusta;</HI> which, for some time, superseded the antient one of <HI>Londinium.</HI> Long before this period, it was fully <HI>romanized,</HI> and the customs, manners, build∣ings, and arts of the conqueror adopted. The commerce of the empire flowed in regularly; came in a direct channel from the se∣veral parts then known, not as in the earlier days (when described by <HI>Strabo</HI>) by the intervention of other nations; for till the settle∣ment of the <HI>Roman</HI> conquest, nothing could come immediately from <HI>Italy.</HI> The antient course of the walls was as follows:—It began with a fort near the present site of the <HI>Tower,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">EXTENT AND FORM.</NOTE> was conti∣nued along the <HI>Minories,</HI> and the back of <HI>Houndsditch,</HI> across <HI>Bishopsgate street,</HI> in a strait line by <HI>London-wall</HI> to <HI>Cripplegate;</HI> then returned southward by <HI>Crowder's Well Alley,</HI> (where several remnants of lofty towers were lately to be seen) to <HI>Aldersgate;</HI> thence along the back of <HI>Bull and Mouth street</HI> to <HI>Newgate,</HI> and again along the back of the houses in the <HI>Old Bailey</HI> to <HI>Ludgate;</HI> soon after which it probably finished with another fort, where the house, late the King's Printing House, in <HI>Black Friars,</HI> now stands: from hence another wall ran near the river-side, along <HI>Thames street,</HI> quite to the fort on the eastern extremity. In another place I shall have occasion to mention that the river at present is moved considerably more to the south, than it was in the times in question.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">TOWERS.</NOTE>THE walls were three miles a hundred and sixty-five feet in circumference, guarded at proper distances, on the land side, with fifteen lofty towers; some of them were remaining within these few years, and possibly may still. <HI>Maitland</HI> mentions one, twenty-six feet high, near <HI>Gravel-lane,</HI> on the west side of <HI>Houndsditch;</HI> another, about eighty paces south-east towards <HI>Aldgate;</HI> and the
<PB N="9" REF="17"/>
bases of another, supporting a modern house, at the lower end of the street called the <HI>Vineyard,</HI> south of <HI>Aldgate.</HI> But since his publication, they have been demolished, so that there is not a trace left. The walls, when perfect, are supposed to have been twenty-two feet high, the towers, forty. These, with the rem∣nants of the wall, proved the <HI>Roman</HI> structure, by the tiles and disposition of the masonry. <HI>London-wall,</HI> near <HI>Moorfields,</HI> is now the most entire part left of that ancient precinct.</P>

<P>IN most parts of antient <HI>London,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ANTIQUITIES.</NOTE> <HI>Roman</HI> antiquities have been found, whenever it has been thought necessary to dig to any con∣siderable depth. Beneath the old <HI>Saint Mary le Bow</HI> were found the walls, windows, and pavement of a <HI>Roman Temple;</HI> and not far from it, eighteen feet deep in adventitious soil, was the <HI>Ro∣man</HI> causeway. The great elevation of the present ground above its former state, will be taken notice of in another place.</P>
<P>IN digging the foundation for the rebuilding of <HI>St. Paul's,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="18"/>
was found a vast coemetery: first lay the <HI>Saxons,</HI> in graves lined with chalk-stones, or in coffins of hollowed stones; beneath them had been the bodies of the <HI>Britons,</HI> placed in rows. Abundance of ivory and boxen pins, about six inches long, marked their place. These were supposed to have fastened the shrouds in which the bodies were wrapped<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Parentalia,</HI> p. 266.</NOTE>. These perishing, left the pins entire. In the same row, but deeper, were <HI>Roman</HI> urns intermixed, lamps, lacrymatories; fragments of sacrificial vessels were also discovered, in digging towards the north-east corner; and in 1675, not far from the east corner, at a considerable depth, beneath some flinty pavement, were found numbers of vessels of earthen ware, and of glass, of most exquisite colors and beauty, some inscribed with the names of deities, heroes, or men of rank. Others ornamented with variety of figures in bas relief, of animals and of rose-trees. <HI>Tesulae</HI> of jasper, porphyry, or marble, such as form the pavement we so often see, were also discovered. Also glass beads and rings, large pins of ivory and bone, tusks of boars, and horns of deer sawn through. Also coins of different emperors, among them some of <HI>Constantine;</HI> which at once destroys the conjecture of Mr. <HI>Maitland,</HI> who supposes that this collection were flung together at the sacking of <HI>London</HI> by our injured <HI>Boadicia.</HI></P>
<P>IN 1711, another coemetery was discovered, in <HI>Camomile street,</HI> adjoining to <HI>Bishopsgate.</HI> It lay beneath a handsome tesselated pavement, and contained numbers of urns filled with ashes and cinders of burnt bones; with them were beads, rings, a lacryma∣tory, a fibula, and a coin of <HI>Antoninus.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">IN SPITTLE∣FIELDS.</NOTE>IN <HI>Spittlefields</HI> was another <HI>Roman</HI> burying-place, of which

many curious particulars are mentioned by old <HI>Stow,</HI> in p. 323 of his Survey of <HI>London:</HI> and <HI>Camden</HI> gives a brief account of another, discovered in <HI>Goodman's fields.</HI> Among those sound in <HI>Spittlefields,</HI> was a great ossuary made of glass, encompassed with five parallel circles, and containing a gallon and a half; it had a handle, a very short neck, and wide mouth of a whiter metal. This was presented to Sir <HI>Christopher Wren,</HI> who lodged it in the <HI>Museum</HI> of the Royal Society<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Parentalia,</HI> p. 267. <HI>Grew's Museum,</HI> 380.</NOTE>. I point out these as means of discovering the antient <HI>Roman</HI> precincts of the city.

Chron.</HI></NOTE>. By the year 604, it seems to have reco∣vered from the ravages of the invaders. It became the chief town of the kingdom of <HI>Essex.

<PB N="13" REF="25"/>
that it was an <HI>emporium</HI> of a vast number of nations, who resort∣ed there by sea and by land.</P>
<P>IN the reign of that great prince ALFRED, <HI>London,</HI> or, to use the <HI>Saxon</HI> name, <HI>Lundenburg,</HI> was made by him capital of all <HI>Eng∣land.</HI> In consequence of a vow he had made, he sent <HI>Sighelm,</HI> bishop of <HI>Sherbourn,</HI> first to <HI>Rome,</HI> and from thence to <HI>India,</HI> with alms to the Christians of the town of <HI>St. Thomas,</HI> now called <HI>Bekkeri,</HI> or <HI>Meliapour:</HI> who returned with various rich gems, some of which were to be seen in the church of <HI>Sherbourn,</HI> in the days of <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Malmesbury</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sax.

It is probable that the bishop of <HI>London</HI> for the time being, and the <HI>Portgrave,</HI> were united in the government, for in the <HI>Saxon</HI> charters they are mentioned together: in the time of <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor, <HI>Alswar</HI> the bishop, and <HI>Wolfgar</HI> my <HI>Port∣grave. William</HI> bishop, and <HI>Swerman</HI> my <HI>Portgrave.</HI></P>
<P>LONDON certainly could not have been in the very low con∣dition which some writers represent it to have been, at the time of the Conquest. It had ventured to sally out on the Conqueror, but without success. It fell more by internal faction, than its own weakness; yet there was strength enough left, to make <HI>William</HI> think proper to secure their allegiance, by building that strong fortress the <HI>Tower.</HI> In seventy years from that event, an historian <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Fitzstephen.</NOTE> of that period pretends, that <HI>London</HI> mustered sixty thousand foot, and twenty thousand horse. If this is any thing near the truth, is it possible but <HI>London</HI> must have been very powerful at the time of the Conquest? for the reigns between that period and of <HI>Stephen,</HI> were not well calculated for a great in∣crease of population. I rather concur with them who think that the muster must have been of the militia of the neighboring counties, and <HI>London</HI> the place of rendezvous. A writer <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Peter de Blois,</HI> archdeacon of <HI>London.</HI> See <HI>Fitzstephen,</HI> p. 28, in the note.</NOTE> of that period, and at the very time resident in the capital, with
<PB N="15" REF="27"/>
more appearance of truth, makes the number of inhabitants only forty thousand.</P>
<P>DURING the time of the Conqueror, and till the reign of <HI>Richard</HI> I. the name of the civil governor continued the same. That monarch, to support the madness of the <HI>crusade,</HI> received from the citizens a large sum of money; and in return, permitted them to chuse annually two officers, under the name of bailiffs, or sheriffs; who were to supersede the former. The names of the two first upon record are <HI>Wolgarius,</HI> and <HI>Geffry de Magnum.</HI></P>
<P>IN the next reign was added the office of mayor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHANGED TO A MAYOR.</NOTE> a title bor∣rowed from the <HI>Norman Maire,</HI> as well as the office. <HI>Henry Fitz-alwyn</HI> was the first elected <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o that trust. He had been be∣fore mayor, but only by the nomination of his prince.</P>
<P>IN the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> III. after the citizens had suffered many oppressions, he restored a form of government, and appointed twenty-four citizens to share the power. In his son's reign, we find the city divided into twenty-four wards; the supreme ma∣gistrate of which was named <HI>Alderman,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ALDERMEN.</NOTE> an exceeding antient <HI>Saxon</HI> title. <HI>Aelder-man,</HI> a man advanced in years, and accordingly supposed to be of superior wisdom and gravity. In the time of <HI>Edgar,</HI> the office was among the first in the kingdom. <HI>Ailwyn,</HI> ancestor to the first mayor, was alderman of all <HI>England;</HI> what the duties of his office were, does not appear.</P>
<P>HE must be a <HI>Briarcus</HI> in literature, who would dare to at∣tempt a history of our capital, on the great, the liberal, the ele∣gant plan which it merits. I, a puny adventurer, animated with a mind incapable of admitting a vacant hour; restless when un∣employed in the rural scenes to which my fortunate lot has des∣tined me, must catch and enjoy the idea of the minute. In the
<PB N="16" REF="28"/>
pursuit of my plan, I wish to give a slight view of the shores I am about to launch from: the account must be brief and confin∣ed, limited to what I shall say of their antient state, to the pe∣riod bounded by the REVOLUTION; intermixed with the greater events, which have happened in nearer days.</P>
<P>THE choice of the situation of this great city was most judi∣cious. It is on a gravelly soil; and on a declivity down to the borders of a magnificent river. The slope is evident in every part of the antient city, and the vast modern buildings. The antient city was defended in front by the river; on the west side by the deep ravine, since known by the name of <HI>Fleet-ditch;</HI> on the north by morasses; on the east, as I suspect, by another ra∣vine. All the land round <HI>Westminster Abbey</HI> was a flat sen, which continued beyond <HI>Fulham:</HI> but a rise commences opposite to it, and forms a magnificent bend above the curvature of the <HI>Thames,</HI> even to the <HI>Tower.</HI> The <HI>Surry</HI> side was in all probability a great expanse of water, a lake, a <HI>Llyn,</HI> as the <HI>Welsh</HI> call it; which an ingenious countryman of mine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>William Owen,</HI> of <HI>Barmouth,</HI> now resident in <HI>London.</HI></NOTE>, not without reason, thinks might have given a name to our capital; <HI>Llyn Din,</HI> or the city on the lake. This most probably was the original name: and that de∣rived from <HI>Llong</HI> a ship, and <HI>Din</HI> a town, might have been be∣stowed when the place became a seat of trade, and famous for the concourse of shipping. The expanse of water might have filled the space between the rising grounds at <HI>Deptfor</HI> and those at <HI>Clapham;</HI> and been bounded to the south by the beautiful <HI>Surry Hills. Lambeth Marsh,</HI> and the <HI>Bank Side,</HI> evidently were reco∣vered from the water. Along <HI>Lambeth</HI> are the names of <HI>Narrow
<PB N="17" REF="29"/>
Walls,</HI> or the mounds which served for that purpose; and in <HI>South-wark, Bankside</HI> again shews the means of converting the antient lake into useful land: even to this day the tract beyond <HI>South-wark,</HI> and in particular that beyond <HI>Bermondsey street,</HI> is so very low, and beneath the level of common tides, that the proprietors are obliged to secure it by embankments.</P>
<P>I BEGIN my account by crossing over the <HI>Thames</HI> into <HI>Surry,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SURRY.</NOTE> which, with <HI>Sussex,</HI> formed the country of the antient <HI>Regni,</HI> being part of this island to which the <HI>Romans</HI> permitted a kingly govern∣ment, merely to enjoy the insolent boast of having kings as their slaves. The <HI>Saxons</HI> bestowed on this part their own names of <HI>Suthry</HI> or <HI>Suthrea,</HI> from its situation on the southern part of the river. I proceed to my accustomed walk of LAMBETH.<NOTE PLACE="marg">LAMBETH.</NOTE> In the earlier times it was a manor, possibly a royal one, for the great <HI>Hardiknut</HI> died here in 1042, in the midst of the jollity of a wed∣ding dinner: and here, without any formality, the usurper <HI>Harold</HI> is said to have snatched the crown, and placed it on his own head. At that period it was part of the estate of <HI>Goda,</HI> wife to <HI>Walter</HI> earl of <HI>Mantes,</HI> and <HI>Eustace</HI> earl of <HI>Boulogne;</HI> who present∣ed it to the church of <HI>Rochester,</HI> but reserved to herself the patro∣nage of the church. It became, in 1197, the property of the see of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> by exchange transacted between <HI>Glanville</HI> bishop of <HI>Rochester,</HI> and the archbishop <HI>Hubert Walter. Glanville</HI> re∣served out of the exchange a small piece of land, on which he built a house called <HI>Rochester Place,</HI> for the reception of the bi∣shops of <HI>Rochester,</HI> whenever they came to attend parlement. In 1357, <HI>John de Shepey</HI> built <HI>Stangate stairs,</HI> for the convenience of himself and retinue to cross over into <HI>Westminster. Fisher</HI> and
<PB N="18" REF="30"/>
<HI>Hilsley</HI> were the last bishops who inhabited this palace; after their deaths it fell into the hands of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. who exchanged with <HI>Aldridge</HI> bishop of <HI>Carliste,</HI> for certain houses in the <HI>Strand.</HI> Its name was changed to that of <HI>Carlisle house</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ducarel's Lambeth, <HI>72.</HI></NOTE>. The small houses built on its site still belong to that see. It had been the design of archbishop <HI>Walter,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A COLLEGE OF SECULAR MONKS PROJECTED HERE</NOTE> to have erected here a college of secular monks, independent of those of <HI>Canterbury.</HI> It was originally designed, by archbishop <HI>Baldwyn,</HI> to have been built at <HI>Hackington,</HI> near that city: but such a jealousy did those holy men conceive at the thought of a rival house so near to their own, that by their in∣terest with the pope the project was layed aside. It was afterwards resumed by <HI>Hubert Walter,</HI> who thought he could give no offence by erecting the college on this distant manor; but the monks ob∣taining a bull from the pope in their favor, and such humiliating terms prescribed to the archbishop, that from thenceforth he en∣tirely desisted from the design <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">8, 9.</NOTE>. The mortifications which the primates met with in the prosecution, seem to have first determin∣ed them in fixing their residence here. <HI>Walter</HI> and <HI>Langton</HI> suc∣cessively lived at the manor-house of <HI>Lambeth.</HI> The last improved it, but the building was afterwards neglected and became ruinous. No pious zeal restored the place, but the madness of priestly pride. <HI>Boniface,</HI> a wrathful and turbulent primate, elected in 1244, took it into his head to become a visitor of the priory of <HI>St. Bartholomew,</HI> to which he had no right. The monks met him with reverential respect, but assured him the office did not belong to the bishop. The meek prelate rushed on the sub-prior, knocked him down,
<PB N="19" REF="31"/>
kicked, beat, and buffeted him, tore the cope off his back, and stamped on it like one possessed, while his attendants payed the same compliments to all the poor monks. The people, enraged at his unpriestly conduct, would have torn him to pieces; when he retired to <HI>Lambeth,</HI> and, by way of expiation, rebuilt it with great magnificence.</P>
<P>THIS palace was very highly improved by the munificent <HI>Henry Chichely,</HI> who enjoyed the primacy from 1414 to 1443. I lament to find so worthy a man to have been the founder of a building so reproachful to his memory as the <HI>Lollards</HI> tower, at the expence of near two hundred and eighty pounds. Neither protestants or catholics should omit visiting this tower, the cruel prison of the unhappy followers of <HI>Wickliffe.</HI> The vast staples and rings, to which they were chained before they were brought to the stake, ought to make protestants bless the hour which freed them from so bloody a religion. Catholics may glory, that time has softened their zeal into charity for all sects, and made them blush at these memorials of the misguided zeal of our an∣cestors.</P>
<P>THIS palace suffered greatly in the civil wars. After those of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Lancaster,</HI> it was restored by archbishop <HI>Morton.</HI> He also built the gateway; in the lower room of which are still to be seen the rings to which the overflowings of the <HI>Lollards</HI> tower were chained.</P>
<P>AFTER the civil wars of the last century,<NOTE PLACE="marg">FANATICAL FURY.</NOTE> when fanatical was united with political fury, it was found that every building de∣voted to piety, had suffered more than they had done in all the rage of family contest. The fine works of art, and the sacred memorials of the dead, were, except in a few cases, sacrificed to
<PB N="20" REF="32"/>
puritanical barbarism, or to sacrilegious plunder. <HI>Lambeth</HI> tell to the share of the miscreant regicide <HI>Scot.</HI> He turned the chapel into a hall, and levelled, for that purpose, the fine monument of archbishop <HI>Parker:</HI> he pulled down the noble hall, the work of <HI>Chichely,</HI> and sold the materials for his own profit. <HI>Juxon,</HI> on the Restoration, found the palace of his predecessors a heap of ruins. His piety rebuilt a greater part than could have been expected from the short time he enjoyed the primacy. He rebuilt the great hall on the antient model, when the archbishop with his particu∣lar friends sat at the high table: the steward with the servants, who were gentry of the better rank, sat at the table on the right hand side: the almoner, the clergy, and others, occupied the table on the left. None but nobility or privy counsellors were admitted to the table of the archbishop. The bishops themselves sat at the almoner's; the other guests at the steward's. All the meat which was not consumed, was regularly given to the idle poor, who waited in crowds at the gate. It is not the defect of charity in modern prelates that this custom is difused; but the happy change in the times. Every one must now eat the bread of his own industry; a much more certain support than the casual bounty of the great; which misfortunes often prevented, and left the object a prey to misery and famine. What is styled the luxury of the times, has by no means superseded deeds of alms. Wealth is more equally diffused; but charity is equally great: it passes now through many channels, and makes less noise than when it was poured through fewer streams.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">LIBRARY.</NOTE>THE fine library in this palace was founded by archbishop <HI>Bancroft;</HI> who died in 1610, and left all his books to his successors, for ever. The succeeding archbishop, <HI>Abbot,</HI> bequeathed all his
<PB N="21" REF="33"/>
books in his great study, marked C. C. in the same unlimited manner.</P>
<P>ON the suppression of episcopacy, this valuable library was preserved by the address of the celebrated Mr. <HI>Selden.</HI> It seems that archbishop <HI>Bancroft</HI> had left his books to his successors, on condition that the immediate successor was to give bond that they should not be embezzled; but delivered entire from one to the other for ever. On failure of this article, they were to go to <HI>Chelsea College,</HI> in case it was built in six years after his decease. The college never was finished: but whether any of <HI>Bancroft</HI>'s successors gave the security does not appear. The books were remaining at <HI>Lambeth</HI> in 1646, two years after the execution of archbishop <HI>Laud;</HI> when probably fearing for their safety in times so inimical to learning, Mr. <HI>Selden</HI> suggested to the univer∣sity of <HI>Cambridge</HI> their right to the books; and the whole were delivered into their possession. On the Restoration, archbishop <HI>Juxon</HI> demanded the return of the library; which was repeated by his successor <HI>Sheldon,</HI> as founded on the will of the pious foun∣der: and they were restored accordingly. Archbishop <HI>Sheldon</HI> added a considerable number: and archbishop <HI>Tenison</HI> augmented it with part of his books.</P>
<P>THAT very worthy prelate archbishop <HI>Secker,</HI> besides a consi∣derable sum expended on making catalogues to the old registers of the see, left to the library all such books from his own, as were not in the former, which comprehended much the largest and most valuable part of his own collection.</P>
<P>ARCHBISHOP <HI>Cornwallis</HI> bestowed many valuable books in his life-time. And the present archbishop has given a considerable sum for fitting up a proper repository for the valuable collec∣tion
<PB N="22" REF="34"/>
of manuscripts. The whole number of printed books amounts to twenty-five thousand.</P>
<P>THE other apartments have within these few years received considerable improvements.<NOTE PLACE="marg">G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>S</NOTE> The great gallery, which is near ninety feet long by fifteen feet nine inches broad, has lately had the addition of a bow window, by the present amiable primate. An opening has been made towards the river, by the cutting down of a few trees, which admits a most beautiful view of the wa∣ter, part of the bridge, and of the venerable abbey. This gallery is filled with portraits of primates or prelates, among others, that of cardinal <HI>Pole,</HI> the founder of this very room. Over the chim∣ney are the heads of those of the earlier times, such as archbishop <HI>Warham,</HI> by <HI>Holbein; St. Dunstan,</HI> and archbishop <HI>Chichely:</HI> the first imaginary, the last probably taken from painted glass. Among these distinguished characters, <HI>Katherine Parr</HI> has found a place, and not without just clame; it being reasonable to suppose, but for the death of her tyrant, she would have been devoted to the stake for the favor she bore to the reformed religion. I must not omit mention of the two portraits of archbishop <HI>Parker,</HI> second primate of the protestant religion; one is by <HI>Holbein,</HI> the other by <HI>Richard Lyne,</HI> who jointly practised the arts of painting and engraving in the service of this great patron of science <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Granger,</HI> i. 202.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN the dining-room is a succession of primates, from the violent and imprudent <HI>Laud</HI> to the quiet and discreet <HI>Cornwallis.</HI> The portrait of <HI>Laud</HI> is admirably done by <HI>Vandyke; Juxon,</HI> from a good original which I saw last year at <HI>Longleate; Tenison,</HI> by <HI>Simon Dubois; Herring,</HI> by <HI>Hogarth; Hutton,</HI> by <HI>Hudson; Secker,</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="35" MS="y"/>
by <HI>Reynolds;</HI> and <HI>Cornwallis,</HI> by <HI>Dance.</HI> Here are besides in the gallery, by the last master, portraits of <HI>Terrick</HI> late bishop of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> and <HI>Thomas</HI> late bishop of <HI>Winchester:</HI> and another of bishop <HI>Hoadley,</HI> which does honor to the artist, his wife, <HI>Sarah Curtis.</HI> When I looked into the garden I could not but recall the scene of conference between the great the wise earl of <HI>Clarendon,</HI> and the unfortunate <HI>Laud. Hyde</HI> laid before him the resentment of all ranks of people against him for his passionate and ill-man∣nered treatment even of persons of rank. The primate attended to the honest chancellor with patience, and palliated his faults <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life of <HI>Edward</HI> earl of <HI>Clarendon,</HI> octavo ed. i. 62.</NOTE>. The advice was forgotten, nor his folly cured till he had involved himself and master in destruction.</P>
<P>A MORE phlegmatic cohabitant of the garden,<NOTE PLACE="marg">LONGEVITY OF A TORTOISE.</NOTE> enjoyed his situa∣tion during many successions to this self-devoted metropolitan. A <HI>Tortoise,</HI> introduced here in his days (in 1633) lived till the year 1753, the time of archbishop <HI>Herring,</HI> and possibly might have lived till the present, had it not been killed by the negli∣gence of the gardener.</P>
<P>IN the vestry is a portrait of <HI>Luther</HI> and his wife; the lady ap∣pears pregnant. This great reformer left three sons, <HI>John, Martin,</HI> and <HI>Paul.</HI></P>
<P>IN one of the apartments of the palace is a performance that does great honor to the ingenious spouse of a modern dignitary; a copy in needlework of a <HI>Madonna</HI> and child, after a most capital performance of the <HI>Spanish Murillo.</HI> There is most admirable grace in the original, which was sold last winter at the price of eight hundred guineas <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In Mr. <HI>Vandergucht</HI>'s sale.</NOTE>. It made me lament that this excellent mas∣ter
<PB N="24" REF="36"/>
had wasted so much time on beggars and ragged boys. Beau∣tiful as it is, the copy came improved out of the hand of our skil∣ful countrywoman; a judicious change of color of part of the drapery, has had a most happy effect, and given new excellence to the admired original.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHURCH.</NOTE>THE parish church of <HI>Lambeth</HI> is at a small distance from the palace, has a plain tower, and the architecture of the gothic of the time of <HI>Edward</HI> IV. It has very little remarkable in it, ex∣cept the figure of a pedlar and his dog, painted in one of the windows. Tradition says, that the parish was obliged to this man for the bequest of a piece of land, which bears the name of <HI>The Pedlar's Acre.</HI></P>
<P>BEFORE I go any farther, let me mention the sad example of fallen majesty in the person of <HI>Mary d'Este,</HI> the unhappy queen of <HI>James</HI> II; who flying with her infant prince from the ruin im∣pending over their house, after crossing the <HI>Thames</HI> from the ab∣dicated <HI>Whitehall,</HI> took shelter beneath the antient walls of this church a whole hour, from the rain of the inclement night of <HI>December</HI> 6th, 1688. Here she waited with aggravated misery, till a common coach, procured from the next inn, arrived, and conveyed her to <HI>Gravesend,</HI> from whence she sailed, and bid an eternal adieu to these kingdoms <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rapin,</HI> 2d ed. folio ii, 781.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN this place rest from their labors several of the later pri∣mates, without any remarkable monument, except their good works, to preserve them from oblivion; among them is <HI>Bancroft, Tenison, Hutton;</HI> and in a passage leading to the palace, are the remains of <HI>Secker.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="37"/>HERE likewise was interred the mild, amiable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BISHOP TUNSTAL.</NOTE> and polished prelate <HI>Cuthbert Tunstal,</HI> bishop of <HI>Durham,</HI> who, deprived on ac∣count of his attachment to the old religion, by <HI>Edward</HI> VI. was restored by <HI>Mary,</HI> and again deprived by <HI>Elizabeth:</HI> here he found an asylum in the family of archbishop <HI>Parker,</HI> so highly was he esteemed even by the protestants; here he passed his days with honor and tranquillity, till his death in 1559.</P>
<P>IN the same church are the remains of <HI>Thirlebye,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BISHOP THIRLE∣BYE.</NOTE> once bishop of <HI>Ely,</HI> deprived for the same cause by <HI>Elizabeth.</HI> By the charity of the above-mentioned great prelate, he found the same protec∣tion as his fellow-sufferer <HI>Tunstal.</HI> To shew the humanity of protestantism, he was indulged with the company of his secretary. He merited every favor. Being joined in commission with <HI>Bonner</HI> for the degradation of <HI>Cranmer,</HI> he performed his office with as much tenderness, as his associate did with brutality, and melted into tears over fallen greatness. His body was found in digging the grave for archbishop <HI>Cornwallis.</HI> His long and venerable beard, and every part, was entire, and of a beautiful whiteness: a slouched hat was under his left arm: his dress that of a pilgrim, as he esteemed himself to be upon earth.</P>
<P>A NEAT bust, with the body in armour, and with artillery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ROBERT SCOT.</NOTE> drums, and trophies around, exhibits the military character of <HI>Robert Scot,</HI> who entered into the service of <HI>Gustavus Adolphus,</HI> and brought with him two hundred men. He was made muster-master general to that hero; afterwards he went into the service of <HI>Denmark;</HI> and finally, in 1631, closed his life in that of <HI>Charles</HI> I. who made him gentleman of his privy chamber, and bestowed on him a pension of six hundred a year. He was of the family of the antient barons of <HI>Bawtrie,</HI> in <HI>North Britain;</HI> but
<PB N="26" REF="38"/>
his character surpassed his origin.<NOTE PLACE="marg">INVENTOR OF LEATHERN AR∣TILLERY.</NOTE> He was the inventor of lea∣thern artillery, which he introduced into the army of <HI>Gustavus,</HI> and by that means contributed highly to the glorious victory of <HI>Leipsic.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">TOMB OF THE TRADESCANTS.</NOTE>IN the church-yard is a tomb which no naturalist should neg∣lect visiting, that of old <HI>John Tradescant,</HI> who, with his son, lived in this parish. The elder was the first person who ever formed a cabinet of curiosities in this kingdom. The father is said to have been gardener to <HI>Charles</HI> I. But <HI>Parkinson</HI> says,
<Q>sometimes be∣longing to the right honorable lord <HI>Robert</HI> earl of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> lord treasurer of <HI>England</HI> in his time; and then unto the right honorable the lord <HI>Wotton,</HI> at <HI>Canterbury,</HI> in <HI>Kent;</HI> and lastly unto the late duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Parkinson<HI>'s</HI> Paradi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur Terrestris, <HI>152.</HI></NOTE>.</Q>
Both father and son were great travellers; the father is supposed to have visited <HI>Russia</HI> and most parts of <HI>Europe, Turkey, Greece,</HI> many of the eastern countries, <HI>Egypt,</HI> and <HI>Barbary;</HI> out of which he introduced multi∣tudes of plants and flowers, unknown before in our gardens. His was an age of florists: the chief ornaments of the parterres were owing to his labors. <HI>Parkinson</HI> continually acknowleges the obligation. Many plants were called after his name: these the <HI>Linnaean</HI> system has rendered almost obsolete: but the great na∣turalist
<PB N="27" REF="39"/>
hath made more than reparation, by giving to a genus of plants the title of TRADESCANTIA <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Species Plantarum,</HI> i. 411.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">MUSEUM TRA∣DESCANTIANUM.</NOTE> The <HI>Museum Tradescan∣tianum,</HI> a small book, adorned by he hand of <HI>Hollar</HI> with the heads of the father and the son, is a proof of their industry. It is a catalogue of their vast collection, not only of the subjects of the three kingdoms of nature, but of artificial rarities from great va∣riety of countries. The collection of medals, coins, and other antiquities, appears to have been very valuable. Zoology was in their time but in a low state, and credulity far from being ex∣tinguished: among the eggs is one supposed to have been of the <HI>dragon,</HI> and another of the <HI>griffin.</HI> You might have found here two feathers of the tail of the <HI>phoenix,</HI> and the claw of the <HI>ruck,</HI> a bird able to <HI>trusse an elephant.</HI> Notwithstanding this, the collec∣tion was extremely valuable, especially in the vegetable king∣dom. In his garden, at his house in <HI>South Lambeth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">THEIR GARDEN.</NOTE> was an amazing arrangement of trees, plants, and flowers. It seems to have been particularly rich in those of the east, and of <HI>North America.</HI> His merit and assiduity must have been very great; for the eastern traveller must have labored under great difficulties from the barbarity of the country: and <HI>North America</HI> had in his time been but recently settled. Yet we find the names of numbers of trees and plants still among the rarer of much later times. To him we are also indebted for the luxury of many fine fruits; for, as <HI>Parkinson</HI> observed,
<Q>The choysest for goodnesse, and rarest for knowledge, are to be had of my very good friend Master <HI>John Tradescante,</HI> who hath wonderly laboured to ob∣taine all the rarest fruits hee can heare off in any place of <HI>Chris∣tendome,

He lived at a large house in this parish, and had an extensive garden, much visited in his days. After his death, which happened about the year 1652, his collection came into the possession of the famous Mr. <HI>Elias Ashmole,</HI> by virtue of a deed of gift which Mr. <HI>Trades∣cant,</HI> junior, had made to him of all his rarities, in true astrolo∣gical form, being dated <HI>December</HI> 16, 1657, 5 <HI>hor.</HI> 30 minutes <HI>post merid.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ashmole</HI>'s Diary, 36.</NOTE>. Mr. <HI>Ashmole</HI> also purchased the house, which is still in being, the garden fell to decay. In the year 1749, it was visited by two respectable members of the Royal Society <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The late Sir <HI>William Watson,</HI> and Doctor <HI>Mitchel.</HI>—See <HI>Ph. Trans.</HI> vol. xlvi. p. 160.</NOTE>, who found among the ruins some trees and plants, which evidently were introduced here by the industrious founder. The collection of curiosities were removed by Mr. <HI>Ashmole,</HI> to his <HI>Museum</HI> at <HI>Oxford,</HI> where they are carefully preserved. Many very curious articles are to be seen: among others, several original dresses and weapons of the <HI>North Americans,</HI> in their original state; which may in some period prove serviceable in illustrating their man∣ners and antiquities.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">MONUMENT DE∣SCRIBED.</NOTE>THE monument of the <HI>Tradescants</HI> was erected in 1662, by <HI>Hester,</HI> relict of the younger. It is an altar tomb: at each corner is cut a large tree, seeming to support the slab: at one end is an <HI>hydra</HI> picking at a bare scull, possibly designed as an emblem of Envy: on the other end are the arms of the family: on one side are ruins, <HI>Grecian</HI> pillars, and capitals; an obelisk and pyramid, to denote the extent of his travels: and on the opposite, a croco∣dile,
<PB N="29" REF="41"/>
and various shells, expressive of his attention to the study of natural history. Time had greatly injured this monument; but in 1773 it was handsomely restored, at the parish expence; and the inscription, which was originally designed for it, engraven on the stone. As it is both singular and historical, I present it to the reader.</P>

<P>IN contrast to these innocent characters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">GUY FAUX.</NOTE> I shall mention that desperate miscreant <HI>Guy Faux,</HI> or <HI>Vauxe,</HI> as an inhabitant of this parish. He lived in a large mansion called <HI>Faux-hall,</HI> and, as Doctor <HI>Ducarel</HI> imagines, was lord of the manor of the same name. In foreign parts a <HI>colonne infame</HI> would have been erected on the spot: but the site is now occupied by <HI>Marble-hall,</HI> and <HI>Cumberland</HI> tea-gardens, and several other buildings.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="42"/>FROM <HI>Lambeth</HI> I returned by the water-side, near the end of <HI>Westminster</HI> bridge, along a tract once a dreary marsh, and still in parts called <HI>Lambeth</HI> marsh; about the year 1560, there was not a house on it, from <HI>Lambeth</HI> palace as far as <HI>Southwark.</HI> Sir <HI>William Dugdale</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugdale</HI>'s embankments, p. 67.</NOTE> makes frequent mention of the works for se∣curing it, in old times, by embankments or <HI>walls</HI> as they are styled, to restrain the ravages of the tide. The embankments in <HI>Southwark</HI> must have been the work of the <HI>Romans,</HI> otherwise they never could have erected the buildings or made the roads of which such frequent vestiges have been found. Most of this tract is become firm land, and covered with most useful buildings even to the edge of the river.<NOTE PLACE="marg">MRS. COADE'S ARTIFICIAL STONE.</NOTE> In a street called <HI>Narrow Wall</HI> (from one of the antient embankments) is Mrs. <HI>Coade</HI>'s manufac∣ture of artificial stone. Her repository consists of several very large rooms filled with every ornament which can be used in archi∣tecture. The statue, the vase, the urn, the rich chimney-pieces, and, in a few words, every thing which could be produced out of natural stone or marble by the most elegant chisel, is here to be ob∣tained at an easy rate. Proof has been made of its durable quality. The inventor has been able to ward off the attacks of time, but not of envy: a beautiful font, now the ornament of <HI>Dibden</HI> church in <HI>Essex,</HI> and which was formed on a most admirable antique model, was denied to the public eye, in a place where liberality ought to have enjoyed the freest reign.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">ENGLISH WINES;</NOTE>NOTWITHSTANDING the climate of <HI>Great Britain</HI> has, at lest of late years, been unfavorable to the production of wines: yet, in the year 1635, we began to make some from the raisins or
<PB N="31" REF="43"/>
dried grapes of <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portugal. Francis Chamberlayne</HI> made the attempt, and obtained a patent for fourteen years, in which it is alleged that his wines would keep good during several years, and even in a voyage under the very line <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rymer</HI>'s <HI>Foedera,</HI> xix. 719.</NOTE>. The art was most successfully revived, several years ago, by <HI>Mark Beaufoy,</HI> and the foreign wines most admirably mimicked. Such is the prodigality and luxury of the age, that the demand for many sorts exceeds in a great degree the produce of the native vine∣yards. We have skilful fabricators, who kindly supply our wants. It has been estimated, that half of the port, and five-sixths of the white wines consumed in our capital, have been the produce of our home wine-presses. The product of duty to the state from a single house, was in one year, from <HI>July</HI> 5th, 1785, to <HI>July</HI> 5th, 1786, not less than £. 7,363.9s 8 ½ <HI>d.</HI> The genial banks of the <HI>Thames</HI> opposite to our capital, yield almost every species of white wine; and, by a wondrous magic, Messrs. <HI>Beaufoy</HI> pour forth the materials for the rich <HI>Frontiniac,</HI> to the more elegant tables; the <HI>Madeira,</HI> the <HI>Caleavella,</HI> and the <HI>Lisbon,</HI> into every part of the kingdom.</P>
<P>THIS great work, and that for the making of vinegar,<NOTE PLACE="marg">AND VINEGAR.</NOTE> is at a small distance from Mrs. <HI>Coade</HI>'s. I can scarcely say how much I was struck with the extent of the undertaking. There is a magnificence of business, in this ocean of sweets and sours, that cannot fail exciting the greatest admiration: whether we consider the number of vessels, or their size.<NOTE PLACE="marg">GREAT TONS.</NOTE> The boasted ton at <HI>Heydel∣berg</HI> does not surpass them. On first entering the yard, two rise before you, covered at the top with a thatched dome; between
<PB N="32" REF="44"/>
them is a circular turret, including a winding staircase, which brings you to their summits, which are above twenty-four feet in diameter. One of these conservatories is full of sweet wine, and contains fifty eight thousand one hundred and nine gallons; or eighteen hundred and fifteen barrels of <HI>Winchester</HI> measure. Its superb associate is full of vinegar, to the amount of fifty six thou∣sand seven hundred and ninety-nine gallons, or seventeen hundred and seventy-four barrels, of the same standard as the former. The famous <HI>German</HI> vessel yields even to the last by the quantity of forty barrels <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">According to Mr. <HI>Keysler,</HI> the <HI>Heydelberg</HI> vessel holds two hundred and four tons.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BESIDES these, is an avenue of lesser vessels, which hold from thirty-two thousand five hundred, to sixteen thousand nine hun∣dred and seventy-four gallons each. After quitting this <HI>Brob∣dignagian</HI> scene, we pass to the acres covered with common bar∣rels: we cannot diminish our ideas so suddenly, but at first we imagined we could quaff them off as easily as <HI>Gulliver</HI> did the little hogsheads of the kingdom of <HI>Lilliput.</HI></P>
<P>THIS ground, so profitable to the proprietors, and so produc∣tive of revenue to the state, was in my memory the scene of low dissipation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CUPER'S GAR∣DEN.</NOTE> Here stood <HI>Cuper's Garden,</HI> noted for its fire-works, and the great resort of the profligate of both sexes. This place was ornamented with several of the mutilated statues belonging to <HI>Thomas</HI> earl of <HI>Arundel,</HI> which had been for that purpose beg∣ged from his lordship by one <HI>Boyder Cuper,</HI> a gardener in the family <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Howard</HI> Memoirs, 98.</NOTE>. The more valuable part were bought by lord <HI>Lemster,</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="45"/>
father of the first earl of <HI>Pomfret,</HI> and presented by the earl's widow to the university of <HI>Oxford.</HI> These grounds were then rented by lord <HI>Arundel.</HI> On the pulling down of <HI>Arundel</HI>-house, to make way for the street of that name, these, and several others of the damaged part of the collection, were removed to this place. Numbers were left on the ground, near the river-side, and over∣whelmed with the rubbish brought from the foundation of the new church of <HI>St. Paul</HI>'s. These in after-times were discovered, dug up, and conveyed to the seat of the duke of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> at <HI>Work∣sop</HI> manor. Injured as they are, they appear, from the etchings given by Doctor <HI>Ducarel,</HI> to have had great merit.</P>
<P>THE great timber-yards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">GREAT TIMBER-YARDS.</NOTE> beneath which these antiquities were found, are very well worthy of a visit. One would fear that the forests of <HI>Norway</HI> and the <HI>Baltic</HI> would be exhausted, to supply the want of our overgrown capital, were we not assured, that the resources will successively be increasing, equal to the demand of succeeding ages.</P>
<P>IN this parish are the vast distilleries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">GREAT DISTIL∣LERY.</NOTE> till of late the property of Sir <HI>Joseph Mawhey.</HI> There are seldom less than two thousand hogs constantly grunting at this place; which are kept entirely on the grains. I lament to see the maxim of private vices being public benefits so strongly exemplified in the produce of the duty on this <HI>Stygian</HI> liquor. From <HI>July</HI> 5th, 1785, to <HI>July</HI> 5th, 1786, it yielded £. 450,000. And I have been told of a single distiller who contributed to that sum £. 54,000.</P>
<P>TO the south are <HI>St. George's Fields,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ST. GEORGE'S FIELDS.</NOTE> now the wonder of foreigners approaching by this road to our capital, through ave∣nues of lamps, of magnificent breadth and goodness. I have heard that a foreign ambassador, who happened to make his

Least such
<Q>may be driven to despair by such complicated misery, and be tempted to destroy themselves, and murder their in∣fants <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See the account of the institution.</NOTE>,</Q>
here was founded, in 1765, this humane preventative <HI>The Westminster New Lying-in Hospital.</HI> To obviate all objec∣tion to its being an encouragement to vice, no one is taken in a second time: but this most excellent charity is open to the wor∣thy distressed matron as often as necessity requires. None are rejected who have friends to recommend. And of both descrip∣tions
<PB N="35" REF="47"/>
upwards of four thousand have experienced its salutary effects.</P>
<P>FARTHER on is another institution of a most heavenly nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ASYLUM, OR HOUSE OF RE∣FUGE.</NOTE> calculated to save from perdition of soul and body, the brighter part of the creation: such on whom Providence hath bestowed angelic faces and elegant forms, designed as blessings to mankind, but too often debased to the vilest uses. The hazard that these innocents constantly are liable to, from a thousand temptations, from poverty, from death of parents, from the diabolical procu∣ress, and often from the stupendous wickedness of parents them∣selves, who have been known to sell their beauteous girls for the purpose of prostitution, induced a worthy band to found, in the year 1758, the <HI>Asylum,</HI> or <HI>House of Refuge.</HI> Long may it flourish, and eternal be the reward of those into whose minds so amiable a conception may have entered!</P>
<P>FOR the salvation of those unhappy beings who had the ill for∣tune to lose the benefits of this divine institution, at a small dis∣tance is the <HI>Magdalen Hospital,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">MAGDALEN HOS∣PITAL.</NOTE> for the reception of the penitent prostitutes. To save from vice is one great merit. To reclame and restore to the dignity of honest rank in life is certainly not less meritorious. The joy at the return of one sinner to repen∣tance, is esteemed by the highest authority worthy of the heavenly host. That ecstasy, I trust, this institution has often occasioned. Since its foundation, in the same year with the former, to <HI>De∣cember</HI> 25th, 1786, not fewer than 2,471 have been admitted. Of these (it is not to be wondered that long and evil habits are often incurable) 300 have been discharged, uneasy under constraint; 45 proved lunatics, and afflicted with incurable fits; 60 have died; 52 never returned from hospitals they were sent to; 338
<PB N="36" REF="48"/>
discharged for faults and irregularities.—How to be dreaded is the entrance into the bounds of vice, since the retreat from its paths is so difficult! Finally, 1608 prodigals have been return∣ed to their rejoicing parents, or placed in reputable services, or to honest trades, banes to idleness, and securities against a future relapse.</P>

It was long independent of the city of <HI>London:</HI> but, in consideration of the inconveniences arising from the escape of malefactors from the great capital into this place, it was, in 1327 granted by <HI>Edward</HI> III. to the city, on payment of ten pounds annually. It was then called the village of <HI>Southwark;</HI> it was afterwards styled the bailiwick of <HI>Southwark,</HI> and the mayor and commonalty of <HI>London</HI> appointed the bailiff. This power did not seem sufficient to remedy the evil, a more intimate con∣nection was thought necessary: in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> VI. on a valuable consideration payed to the crown, it was formed into a twenty-sixth ward, by the title of <HI>Bridge ward without,</HI> and Sir <HI>John Ayliff</HI> was its first alderman.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">KING'S-BENCH PRISON.</NOTE>THE <HI>King's-bench</HI> prison, in this parish, is of great antiquity.

It is difficult to say which we should admire most, the courage of the judge, or the peaceful submission of the prince to the commitment, after he was freed from the phrenzy of his rage. The truth of the fact has been doubted; but, it is delivered by several grave histori∣ans, such as <HI>Hall,</HI> who died in 1547, who mentions it <HI>folio</HI> 1; <HI>Grafton,</HI> perhaps his copyist, at p. 443; and the learned Sir

<P>BESIDES these temporary mansions of holy men, were others, for those who preferred the monastic life. The first religious house was that of <HI>St. Mary Overie,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ST.

<P>THESE excellent characters lived together in the most perfect amity: <HI>Chaucer</HI> was a severe reprover of the vices of the clergy; and each united in their great and successful endeavour to give a polish to the <HI>English</HI> language. <HI>Chaucer</HI> gave a free rein to his poetical mirth.

THOMAS'S HOSPITAL.</NOTE> After the fire, the canons built, at a small distance from the priory, an occasional building for their recep∣tion till their house could be re-built. But in 1215, <HI>Peter de Ru∣pibus,</HI> bishop of <HI>Winchester,</HI> disliking the situation, removed it to a place on which <HI>Richard,</HI> a <HI>Norman</HI> prior of <HI>Bermondsey,</HI> had, in 1213, erected a hospital for converts and poor children, which he called the <HI>Almery. Peter de Rupibus</HI> new founded it for canons regular, and endowed it with three hundred and forty-four pounds a year. It was held from the prior and abbot of <HI>Ber∣mondsey,</HI> till the year 1428, when a composition was made be∣tween
<PB N="51" REF="63"/>
the abbot and the master of the hospital of <HI>St. Thomas,</HI> for all the lands and tenements held of the abby for the old rent, to be payed to the said abbot. At the dissolution it was surrendered into the hands of the king. In 1552, it was founded a third time by the citizens of <HI>London,</HI> who purchased the suppressed hospital: in <HI>July</HI> they began the reparation, and in <HI>November</HI> following, opened it for the reception of the sick and poor; not fewer than two hundred and sixty were the first objects of the charity. The patron was at the same time changed: the turbulent <HI>Thomas Becket</HI> very properly giving place to the worthy apostle <HI>St. Thomas.</HI></P>
<P>TOWARDS the end of the last century, the building fell into decay. In the year 1699 the governors solicited the benevolence of the public for its support: and with such success, that they were enabled to re-build it on the magnificent and extensive plan we now see. It consists of three courts, with colonnades be∣tween each: three wards were built at the sole cost of <HI>Thomas Frederic,</HI> esquire, of <HI>London:</HI> and three by <HI>Thomas Guy,</HI> citi∣zen and stationer. The whole containing eighteen wards, and 442 beds. The expences attending this foundation are about £. 10,000 a year. In the middle of the second court is a statue in brass of <HI>Edward</HI> VI. and beneath him the representation of the halt and maimed.</P>
<P>IN that of the third court is a stone statue of Sir <HI>Robert Clayton,</HI> knight, lord mayor of <HI>London,</HI> dressed in character, in his gown and chain. He gave £. 600 towards re-building this hospital; and left £. 2,300 towards the endowing it. The statue was erected before his death, which happened in 1714.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">MR. GUY'S HOSPITAL.</NOTE>MR. <HI>Guy,</HI> not satisfied with his great benefactions to the hospi∣tal of <HI>St. Thomas,</HI> determined to be the sole founder of another. The relation is very remarkable. At the age of seventy-six, he took a lease, of the governors of the former, of a piece of ground opposite to it, for the term of nine hundred and ninety-nine years, and on it, in 1721, at the expence of £. 18,793. 16 <HI>s.</HI> began to build the hospital which bears his name: and left to endow it, the prodigious sum of £. 219,499, amassed from a very small be∣ginning, chiefly by purchasing seamen's tickets, in the reign of queen <HI>Anne;</HI> and by his great success in the buying and selling South Sea stock, in the memorable year 1720; and also a vast sum by the sale of bibles. He seems to have profited both of GOD and <HI>Mammon.</HI> I think he was a native of <HI>Tamworth,</HI> and representative for that borough. His death happened on <HI>December</HI> 27th, 1724; before which he saw his hospital covered with the roof. In the first court is his statue in brass, dressed in his livery gown. Besides his public expences, he gave, during life, to many of his poor relations, £. 10 or £. 20 a year; and to others money to advance them in life; to his aged relations, £. 870 in annuities; and to his younger relations and executors, the sum of £. 75,589!</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="65"/>IN the chapel (shouldering GOD's altar) is another statue of Mr. <HI>Guy,</HI> a most expensive performance by Mr. <HI>J. Bacon,</HI> in 1779, in white marble. He is represented standing, in his livery gown, with one hand raising a miserable sick object, and with the other pointing to a second object, on a bier, carried by two per∣sons into his hospital. This superfluity cost a thousand pounds; a proof of the exuberant wealth of the foundation, which could spare such a sum to be wasted on an idle needless occasion. I was told that at this time there were only two hundred beds: three wards being out of use, undergoing certain alterations. But I could not obtain the lest account of the annual number of patients, or of ex∣penditure, or revenue; which other hospitals never fail of laying before the public.</P>

<P>THE other religious house in <HI>Southwark</HI> was <HI>Bermondsey,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BERMONDSEY ABBY.</NOTE> found∣ed in 1082, by <HI>Aylwin Childe,</HI> a citizen of <HI>London,</HI> for monks of the <HI>Cluniac</HI> order: a cargo of which were imported hither by favor of archbishop <HI>Lanfranc,</HI> in the year 1089, from the priory <HI>De Caritate,</HI> on the <HI>Loire,</HI> in <HI>Nivernois.</HI> Soon after the resumption of the alien priories, it was converted into an abby by <HI>Richard</HI> II.

<P><PB N="54" REF="66"/>THE conventual church was then pulled down by Sir <HI>Thomas Pope,</HI> who built a magnificent house on the site. This became the habitation of the <HI>Ratcliffs,</HI> earls of <HI>Sussex. Thomas,</HI> the great rival of the favorite earl of <HI>Leicester,</HI> breathed his last within its walls.</P>
<P>THE present parochial church of <HI>St. Mary Magdalen</HI> was founded by the priors of <HI>Bermondsey,</HI> for the use of their adjoining tenants.</P>
<P>THE remains of antiquity in this neighborhood are, the antient gate of the abby, with a large arch and a postern on one side. Adjoining is part of a very old building; and on passing beneath the arch, and turning to the left, is to be seen, within a court, a house of very great antiquity, called (for what reason I know not) king <HI>John's court.</HI></P>
<P>BERMONDSEY <HI>street</HI> may at present be called the great <HI>Wool Staple</HI> of our kingdom. Here reside numbers of merchants, who supply <HI>Rochdale, Leicester, Derby, Exeter,</HI> and most other weaving countries in this kingdom, with that commodity. As <HI>Southwark</HI> may be considered as a great suburb to <HI>London,</HI> numbers of other trades are carried on there to a vast extent: the Tanners, Curriers, Hatters, Dyers, Iron-founders, Rope-makers, Sail-makers, and Block-makers, occupy a considerable part of the borough.</P>
<P>THE most eastern parish in <HI>Southwark,</HI> is that of <HI>St. Olave</HI> or <HI>Olaf,</HI> so named from the <HI>Danish</HI> prince who was massacred by his <HI>Pagan</HI> subjects.<NOTE PLACE="marg">ST.

The parish extends from the spot on <HI>London</HI>-bridge, on which was the draw-bridge, and stretches
<PB N="55" REF="67"/>
along the water-side as far as <HI>St. Saviour's Dock.</HI> In this parish, near the church, was the inn or lodging of the abbot of <HI>Lewes</HI> in <HI>Sussex.</HI> The chapel is still remaining, converted into a cellar, and, by the accumulation of earth, sunk under ground: and a gothic building, now turned into a wine vault belonging to the <HI>King's-head</HI> tavern, may have been part of the mansion.</P>
<P>ON <HI>Sellenger</HI>'s wharf stood the town-house of the abbot of <HI>St. Augustine's</HI> at <HI>Canterbury;</HI> which being granted to Sir <HI>Anthony Saint-Leger,</HI> the wharf was named after him, but corrupted ac∣cording to the modern spelling <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Maitland,</HI> ii. 1389.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE abbot of <HI>Battle</HI> had also here his city-mansion. <HI>Battle-bridge,</HI> or rather <HI>Stairs,</HI> took its name from the house: as did the streets called the <HI>Mazes,</HI> from the luxurious intricacies in his mag∣nificent gardens <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Strype</HI>'s <HI>Stow,</HI> I.

<P>ST. <HI>Saviour's Dock,</HI> or, as it is called, <HI>Savory,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ST. SAVIOUR'S DOCK.</NOTE> bounds the eastern end of this parish. <HI>St. Saviour</HI>'s <HI>Dock</HI> may be considered as the port of <HI>Southwark.</HI> It is in length about four hundred yards, but of most disproportionable breadth, not exceeding thirty feet. The borough will certainly give it a more useful magnitude: and also re-build the warehouses and magazines on each side. It is at present solely appropriated to barges, which discharge coals, copperas from <HI>Writtlesea</HI> in <HI>Essex,</HI> pipe-clay, corn, and various other articles of commerce. If the dock was deepened, and cor∣respondent wharfs erected, sloops and lesser vessels might come from different sea-ports, and here discharge their cargoes, without the expence of re-loading lesser craft, in order to re-land them at this dock.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="68"/>IT antiently belonged to the priory of <HI>St. Saviour's Bermondsey,</HI> as did certain adjacent mills, which, in 1536 were let by the monks to one <HI>John Curlew,</HI> for £. 6, then the value of eighteen quarters of good wheat; and he was besides bound to grind <HI>gratis</HI> all the corn used in that religious house.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">ROTHEPHITHE.</NOTE>ON the east side of the dock commences the parish of <HI>Rother∣hithe</HI> or <HI>Redriff,</HI> which consists chiefly of one street of a vast length, running along the shore, and winding with the great bend of the river, to a very small space from <HI>Deptford.</HI> The church, dedicated to <HI>St. Mary,</HI> is remarkable for its steeple, a fluted spire terminating in the <HI>Ionic</HI> scroll. I introduce this parish, be∣cause it is comprehended in the bills of mortality, having been taken in, in the year 1636, with five other parishes. Near the extremity of this parish are the docks for the <HI>Greenland</HI> ships; a profitable nusance, very properly removed to a distance from the capital. The greater dock is supposed to have been the mouth of the famous canal, cut in 1016 by king <HI>Canute,</HI> in order to avoid the impediment of <HI>London</HI>-bridge, and to lay siege to the capital by bringing his fleet to the west side.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">THE LOKE HOS∣PITAL.</NOTE>THE <HI>Loke,</HI> in <HI>Southwark,</HI> was a hospital for leprous persons.

<P>I NOW return to the extremity of the western part of our capi∣tal on the opposite shore.

Here, in my

boyish days, I often experienced the hospitality of the late Sir <HI>Robert Grovenour,</HI> its worthy owner, who enjoyed it, by the pur∣chase, by one of his family, from the <HI>Mordaunts,</HI> earls of <HI>Peter∣borough.</HI> All the rest of his vast property about <HI>London</HI> devolved on him in right of his mother, <HI>Mary,</HI> daughter and heiress of <HI>Alexander Davies</HI> of <HI>Ebury</HI> in the county of <HI>Middlesex.</HI> I find, in the plan of <HI>London</HI> by <HI>Hollar,</HI> a mansion on this spot, under the name of <HI>Peterborough</HI>-house. It probably was built by the first earl of <HI>Peterborough.</HI> It was inhabited by his successors, and retained its name till the time of the death of that great but irregular genius <HI>Charles,</HI> earl of <HI>Peterborough,</HI> in 1735. It was rebuilt in its present form by the <HI>Grovenour</HI> family.</P>
<P>A LITTLE farther was the antient <HI>Horse-ferry</HI> between <HI>Westmin∣ster</HI> and <HI>Lambeth:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">HORSE-FERRY.</NOTE> suppressed on the building of <HI>Westminster</HI>-bridge.</P>
<P>A LITTLE beyond the <HI>Horse-ferry</HI> stands the church of <HI>St. John the Evangelist,</HI> one of the fifty voted by parlement, to give this part of the town the air of the capital of a christian country. It was begun in 1721, and finished in 1728. The architect was Sir <HI>John Vanbrugh.</HI> Notwithstanding it is deservedly censured for its load of ornaments, they are by no means destitute of beauty. The aim at excess of magnificence is not a fault peculiar to the builder.</P>
<P>AT a small distance to the east is that noble specimen of gothic architecture,<NOTE PLACE="marg">WESTMINSTER ABBY.</NOTE> the conventual church of <HI>St. Peter</HI>'s abby of <HI>West∣minster.</HI> The church is said to have been founded about the year 610, by <HI>Sebert</HI> king of the <HI>East-Saxons,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">FOUNDED BY SEBERT.</NOTE> on the ruins of the temple of <HI>Apollo,</HI> flung down, quoth legend, by an earthquake.
<PB N="60" REF="72"/>
The king dedicated his new church to <HI>St. Peter;</HI> who descended in person, with a host of heavenly choristers, to save the bishop of <HI>Mellitus</HI> the trouble of consecration. The saint descended on the <HI>Surry</HI> side, in a stormy night; but, prevaling on <HI>Edric,</HI> a fisher∣man, to waft him over, performed the ceremony: and, as a proof, left behind the chrism, and precious droppings of the wax candles, with which the astonished fisherman saw the church illuminated. He conveyed the saint safely back; who directed him to inform the bishop that there was no farther need of consecration. He likewise directed <HI>Edric</HI> to fling out his nets, who was rewarded with a miraculous draft of falmons: the saint also promised to the fisherman and his successors, that they never should want plenty of salmon, provided they presented every tenth to his church. This custom was observed till at lest the year 1382. The fisher∣man that day had a right to sit at the same table with the prior; and he might demand of the cellerer, ale and bread; and the cel∣lerer again might take of the fish's tail as much as he could, with four fingers and his thumb erect.</P>
<P>THE place in which it was built was then styled <HI>Thornie</HI> island, from its being over-run with thorns and briers; and it was be∣sides insulated by a branch of the <HI>Thames.</HI> This church was burnt by the <HI>Danes;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BURNT BY THE DANES.

<P>WHETHER from the decay of the building,<NOTE PLACE="marg">REBUILT A THIRD TIME BY HENRY III.</NOTE> or a particular zeal and affection <HI>Henry</HI> III. had for the royal <HI>Confessor,</HI> I cannot say, but that prince pulled down the <HI>Saxon</HI> pile, and rebuilt it in the present elegant and magnificent style. In 1245 he began this great work, in the mode of architecture which began to take place in his days. He did not live to complete his design, which was carried on by his successor, and finished in his fourteenth year. A casual fire destroyed the roof; but by the piety of <HI>Edward</HI> and several of the abbots it was restored to the beauty and splen∣dor we so justly admire.</P>
<P>HENRY performed two acts of pious respect to the remains of the founders of this abby, which must not be omitted. He tran∣slated those of <HI>Sebert</HI> into a tomb of touchstone, beneath an arch made in the wall. Above were paintings, long since defaced, done by order of the king, who was strongly imbued with the love of the arts.

<Q>He brought from thence certain workmen, and rich por∣phery stones, whereof hee made that curious, singular, rare pavement before the high altar; and with these stones and workmen he did also frame the shrine of <HI>Edward</HI> the Con∣fessor <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Funeral Monuments, 485.</NOTE>.</Q>
This beautiful memorial consists of three rows of arches; the lower pointed: the upper round. And on each side of the lower is a most elegant twisted pillar, an ornament the artist seems peculiarly fond of. Children, or childish age, has greatly injured this beautiful shrine, by picking out the mosaic, through the shameful connivance of the attendant vergers.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">ANOTHER, BY THE SAME ARTIST.</NOTE>THIS is not the only specimen of <HI>Cavalini</HI>'s, skill, which we possess in this kingdom. Mr. <HI>Walpole</HI> has, at his beautiful villa near town, another shrine of his workmanship, brought, in 1768, from the church of <HI>Santa Maria Maggiore,</HI> in <HI>Rome;</HI> and placed in a chapel in his gardens. It was erected, in 1256, over the bodies of the holy martyrs <HI>Simplicius, Faustina,</HI> and <HI>Beatrix,</HI> by <HI>John James Capoccio,</HI> and <HI>Vinia</HI> his wife. It differs in form from
<PB N="63" REF="75"/>
the shrine of <HI>St. Edward,</HI> but is formed of the same materials, and adorned with the same twisted columns.</P>
<P>ALONG the freeze of the screen of the chapel, are fourteen legendary sculptures respecting the Confessor. They are so rudely done, that we may conclude that the art at this time was at a very low ebb. The first is the trial of queen <HI>Emma.</HI> The next the birth of <HI>Edward.</HI> Another is his coronation. The fourth tells us how our saint was frightened into the abolition of the <HI>dane-gelt,</HI> by his seeing the devil dance upon the money bags. The fifth is the story of his winking at the thief who was robbing his treasury. The sixth is meant to relate the appearance of our SAVIOUR to him. The seventh shews how the invasion of <HI>England</HI> was frustrated by the drowning of the <HI>Danish</HI> king. Eighthly is seen the quarrel between the boys <HI>Tosti</HI> and <HI>Harold,</HI> predicting their respective fates. In the ninth sculpture is the <HI>Confessor</HI>'s vision of the seven sleepers. Tenthly, how he meets <HI>St. John the Evangelist</HI> in the guise of a pilgrim. Eleventhly, how the blind were cured by their eyes being washed in his dirty water. Twelfthly, how <HI>St. John</HI> delivers to the pilgrims a ring. In the thirteenth they deliver the ring to the king, which he had un∣knowingly given to <HI>St. John</HI> as an alms, when he met him in the form of a pilgrim. This was attended with a message from the <HI>Saint,</HI> foretelling the death of the king.

The little book, sold to the visitors of this solemn scenery at the door, will be a sufficient guide to the fine and numerous funebrial memorials of the place. Let me only observe, that here may be read an excellent lecture on the progress of these efforts of human skill, from the simple altar tomb to the most ostentatious proofs of human vanity. The humble recumbent figure with uplifted hands, as if deprecating the justice of Heaven for the offences of this mortal state; or the proper kneeling attitude, supplicating that mercy which the purest must stand in need of, may be seen here in various degrees of elegance.

<P>IN the antient tombs there is a dull uniformity. The sides are often embellished with figures of the offspring of the deceased; often with figures of mourners, <HI>pleureurs,</HI> or weepers <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See the curious contract, in <HI>Dugdale</HI>'s <HI>Warwickshire,</HI> p. 354, between the executors of <HI>Richard Beauchamp</HI> earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> and <HI>John Essex,</HI> marbler; <HI>William Austin,</HI> founder; and <HI>Thomas Stevens,</HI> copper-smith; for their making xiv lords and ladyes in divers vestures called <HI>weepers,</HI> and xiv images of <HI>mour∣ners,</HI> to be gilt by <HI>Bartholemew Lambespring, Dutchman,</HI> and goldsmythe of <HI>Lon∣don.</HI>—Consult also Mr. <HI>Gough</HI>'s Sepulchral Monuments, i. preface, p. 7.</NOTE>, frequently in monastic habits, as whole convents were wont (and still are ac∣customed,

<P>IN the reign of queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and <HI>James</HI> I. begins to appear a ray of taste in the sculptors. I shall instance one of the six sons of <HI>Henry</HI> lord <HI>Norris,</HI> who appear kneeling round his magnificent cenotaph (for he was buried at <HI>Rycot</HI>) in the chapel of <HI>St. An∣drew.</HI> This figure has one hand on his breast, the other a little removed from it, in attitude of devotion, inexpressibly fine. Lord <HI>Norris</HI> died in 1589 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugdale</HI>'s Baronage, ii. 404.—<HI>Dart,</HI> by mistake, calls this nobleman <HI>Francis;</HI> who was grandson to <HI>Henry,</HI> and left only one child, a daughter. He fell a sui∣cide, in a fit of proud resentment, for an imaginary affront on account of a lord <HI>Scrope,</HI> which he had not the sense, or the courage, to accommodate in a proper manner.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ANOTHER proof is in the monument of Sir <HI>Francis Vere,</HI> who died in 1608, distinguished by thirty years of able service in the low countries, in the reign of <HI>Elizabeth.</HI> He lies in a gown re∣cumbent; over him four <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne figures of armed knights, kneeling on one knee, support a marble slab, on which are strewed the various parts of his armour. At <HI>Bredah</HI> is the tomb of <HI>Ingel∣bert</HI> II. count of <HI>Nassau,</HI> who died in 1504; executed on the same idea.</P>
<P>THE figure of young <HI>Francis Hollis,</HI> son of <HI>John</HI> earl of <HI>Clare,</HI> cut off at the age of eighteen, in 1622, on his return from a cam∣paign
<PB N="66" REF="78"/>

<P>THE figure of Doctor <HI>Busby,</HI> master of <HI>Westminster</HI> school, who died in 1695, is elegant and spirited. He lies resting on one arm; a pen in one, a book in the other hand: his countenance looking up. His loose dress is very favorable to the sculptor, who has given it most graceful flows: the close cap alone is inimical to his art.</P>
<P>I CANNOT go through the long series of tombs: nor will I at∣tempt, like the <HI>Egyptians</HI> of old, to bring the silent habitants to a posthumous trial, or bring their frailties to light. I will only mention the crowned heads who here repose, till that day comes which will level every distinction of rank, and shew every individual in his proper characters. <HI>Qualis erat,</HI> says a beautiful and modest inscription, <HI>iste dies indicabit.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">EDWARD I.</NOTE>THE second of our monarchs who lies here, is the renowned <HI>Edward</HI> I. in an altar tomb, as modest and plain, as his fame was great. A long inscription in monkish lines imperfectly records the deeds of the conqueror of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and of the antient <HI>Britons.</HI> In 1770, antiquarian curiosity was so urgent with the respectable dean of <HI>Westminster,</HI> as to prevale on him to permit certain mem∣bers of the society, under proper regulations, to inspect the remains of this celebrated hero; and discover, if possible, the composition which gave such duration to the human body.</P>
<P>IN the minute relation given by that able and worthy antiquary the late Sir <HI>Joseph Ayloffe,</HI> bart. almost every particular is given.
<PB N="67" REF="79"/>
On lifting up the lid of the tomb, the royal body was found wrapped in a strong thick linen cloth, <HI>waxed</HI> on the inside: the head and face were covered with a <HI>sudarium</HI> or face-cloth of crim∣son sarcenet, wrapped into three folds, conformable to the napkin used by our Saviour in his way to his crucifixion, as we are assur∣ed by the church of <HI>Rome.</HI> On flinging open the external mantle, the corpse was discovered in all the ensigns of majesty, richly ha∣bited. The body was wrapped in a fine linen cere-cloth, closely fitted to every part, even to the very fingers and face. The writs <HI>de cera renovanda circa corpus regis Edwardi primi</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Archaelogia,</HI> iii. 376, 398, 399.—Similar warrants were issued on account of <HI>Edward</HI> III. <HI>Richard</HI> II. and <HI>Henry</HI> IV.</NOTE> being extant, gave rise to this search. Over the cere-cloth was a tunic of red silk damsk; above that a stole of thick white tissue crossed the breast, and on this, at six inches distant from each other, quatre-foils of philligree-work, of gilt metal set with false stones, imitat∣ing rubies, sapphires, amethysts, &amp;c.; and the intervals between the quatre-foils on the stole, powdered with minute white beads, tacked down into a most elegant embroidery, in form not unlike what is called the true lover's knot. Above these habits was the royal mantle of rich crimson sattin, fastened on the left shoulder with a magnificent <HI>fibula,</HI> of gilt metal richly chased, and orna∣mented with four pieces of red, and four of blue, transparent paste, and twenty-four more pearls.</P>
<P>THE corpse, from the waist downwards, is covered with a rich cloth of figured gold, which falls down to the feet and is tucked beneath them. On the back of each hand was a quatre-foil like those on the stole. In his right hand is a sceptre with a cross of copper gilt, and of elegant workmanship, reaching to the right
<PB N="68" REF="80"/>
shoulder. In the left hand is the rod and dove, which passes over the shoulder and reaches the royal ear. The dove stands on a ball placed on three ranges of oak leaves of enamelled green; the dove is white enamel. On the head is a crown charged with tre∣foils made of gilt metal <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The dress is represented on a seal of this monarch's, in <HI>Sandford</HI>'s Genea∣logy, 120, with tolerable accuracy.</NOTE>.

<P>THIS picture, after the test of near four hundred years, is in the highest preservation; and not less remarkable for the elegance of the coloring, than the excellent drawing, considering the early age of the performance. We must allow it had been re-painted; but nothing seems altered, if we may collect from the print made by <HI>Vertue,</HI> excepting a correction in the site of the cross issuing out of the globe. The back ground is elevated above the figure, of an uneven surface, and gilt. The curious will find, in Mr. <HI>Walpole</HI>'s Anecdotes, vol. i. an ingenious conjecture of the method of painting in that early period, which has given such amazing duration to the labors of its artists.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">HENRY V.</NOTE>WITHIN a beautiful chapel of gothic workmanship, of open iron-work, ornamented with various images, is the tomb of the gallant prince <HI>Henry</HI> V. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sandford,</HI> 289.</NOTE> a striking contrast to the weak and
<PB N="71" REF="83"/>
luxurious <HI>Richard.</HI> This was built by <HI>Henry</HI> VII. in compli∣ment to his illustrious relation and predecessor. His queen <HI>Ca∣therine</HI> had before erected his monument, and placed his image, cut in heart of oak, and covered over with silver, on an altar tomb; the head was (as the guide tells us) of solid silver, which, in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. was sacrilegiously stolen away. The wooden headless trunk still remains.</P>
<P>ON each side of this royal chapel is a winding staircase, inclos∣ed in a turret of open iron-work, which leads into a chauntry founded for the purpose of masses, for the repose of the soul of this great prince. The front looks over the shrine of the Confes∣sor. Here is kept a parcel of human figures, which in old times were dressed out and carried at funeral processions; but at present very deservedly have got the name of the <HI>ragged regiment.</HI> More worthy of notice is the elegant termination of the <HI>columellae</HI> of the two staircases, which spread at the top of the turrets into roofs of uncommon elegance.</P>
<P>ONE end of this chauntry rests against that of the chapel of <HI>Henry</HI> VII. Among the stone statues placed there is the <HI>French</HI> patron <HI>St. Dennis,</HI> most composedly carrying his head in his hand.</P>
<P>ON the south side of the chauntry, over his monument, is the representation of his coronation. The figure of <HI>Henry</HI> is distin∣guished by a wen under his chin.

She died in 1437, and was interred in the chapel of our lady in this church. When her grandson <HI>Henry</HI> VII. ordered that to be pulled down, to make room for his own magnificent chapel, he ungratefully neglected the remains of this his ancestress, and suffered them to be flung carelessly into a wooden chest, where they still rest near her <HI>Henry</HI>'s tomb.</P>

<PB N="73" REF="85"/>
blood royal should be interred in this magnificent foundation. It was built at the expence of fourteen thousand pounds <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Will of <HI>Henry</HI> VII. preface p. iv.</NOTE>. In the body of this chapel is his superb tomb, the work of <HI>Pietro Torregiano,</HI> a <HI>Florentine</HI> sculptor; who had, for his labor and the materials, one thousand pounds. This admirable artist continued in <HI>London</HI> till the completion of his work in 1519. But the reigning prince and <HI>Torregiano</HI> were of tempers equally turbu∣lent, so they soon separated <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Anecdotes of Painting, i. 97.</NOTE>. To him is attributed the altar tomb of <HI>Margeret</HI> countess of <HI>Richmond,</HI> with her figure recum∣bent in brass. <HI>Henry</HI> VII. had made a special provision for this tomb in his will <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Will of <HI>Henry</HI> VII. published 1775, p. 3, 34.</NOTE>, for the images and various other ornaments,<NOTE PLACE="marg">HIS TOMB.</NOTE> which were to decorate this his place of rest. The tomb itself is, as he directed, made of a hard <HI>Basaltic</HI> stone, called in the language of those days <HI>Touche.</HI> The figures contained in the six bas reliefs in brass on the sides, are strong proofs of the skill of the artist. The figures suit the superstition of the times: <HI>St. Michael</HI> and the devil, joined with the Virgin and Child: <HI>St. George</HI> with <HI>St. Anthony</HI> and his pig: <HI>St. Christopher,</HI> and perhaps <HI>St. Anne: Edward</HI> the Confessor, and a <HI>Benedictine</HI> monk: <HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> and <HI>St. Barbara:</HI> and several others. One pretence is a respect to his grandmother, whose bones he left flung into an ordinary chest. He and his quiet neglected queen lie in brass on an altar tomb within the beautiful brazen precinct; his face resembles all his portraits. I have seen a model, a still stronger likeness, in possession of Mr. <HI>Walpole;</HI> a bust in
<PB N="74" REF="86"/>
stone taken from his face immediately after his death. A stronger reluctance to quit the possessions of this world could never be expressed on the countenance of the most griping mortal.</P>

the same tormenting passion. The long and undeserved suffer∣ings of <HI>Mary,</HI> from one of her own sex, a sister princess, from whom she had reason to expect every relief, makes one forget her crime, and fling a veil over the fault of distressed, yet criminal beauty.</P>

<P>ON the dissolution, this great monastery, the second mitred abby in the kingdom, underwent the common lot of the religious houses. In 1534, the abbot, <HI>William Benson,</HI> subscribed to the king's supremacy, and in 1539 surrendered his monastery into the royal hands, and received as a reward the office of first dean to the new foundation, consisting of a dean and twelve preben∣daries. He also erected it into a bishoprick, but its only bi∣shop was <HI>Thomas Thirleby;</HI> it being suppressed in 1550, on his translation to <HI>Norwich.</HI> When the protector <HI>Somerset</HI> ruled in the fulness of power, this magnificent, this sacred pile narrowly escaped a total demolition. It was his design to have pulled it down to the ground, and to have applied the materials towards the palace he was then erecting in the <HI>Strand,</HI> known by the name of <HI>Somerset</HI>-house. He was diverted from his design by a bribe of not fewer than fourteen manors.— Mortals should be very de∣licate in pronouncing the vengeance of Heaven on their fellow-creatures: yet, in this instance, without presumption, without su∣perstition, one may suppose his fall to have been marked out by the Almighty, as a warning to impious men. He fell on the scaffold on <HI>Tower-hill,</HI> lamented only because his overthrow was effected by a man more wicked, more ambitious, and more detested than himself. In their ends there was a consent of justice: both died by the ax: and both of their headless bodies were flung, within a very short space, into the same place, among the attainted herd.</P>
<P>IN the reign of queen <HI>Mary,</HI> the former religion of the place experienced a brief restoration. She with great zeal restored it
<PB N="78" REF="90"/>
to the antient conventual state; collected many of the rich habits and insignia of that splendid worship; established fourteen monks, and appointed for their abbot <HI>John Feckenham,</HI> a man of great piety and learning, who, on his expulsion in the succeeding reign, finished his days in easy custody in <HI>Wisbech</HI> castle.</P>
<P>IN 1560 it was changed into a collegiate church, consisting of a dean and twelve secular canons, and thirty petty canons, and other members, two school-masters, and forty king's or queen's scholars, twelve almsmen, and many officers and servants <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tanner.</NOTE>. But there seems to have been a school there from the first foundation of the abby. <HI>Ingulphus,</HI> abbot of <HI>Crowland,</HI> speaks of his having been educated at it; and of the disputations he had with the queen of the <HI>Confessor,</HI> and of the presents she made him in money in his boyish days <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Quoted by <HI>Stow,</HI> book 1. vol. i. 123.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>THE entrance into the chapter-house (built in 1250) is on one side of the cloister, through a most rich and magnificent gothic portal, the mouldings most exquisitely carved: this is divided into two gothic doors. After a descent of several steps, is the chap∣ter-house, an octagon, each side of which had most superb and lofty windows, now filled up, and lighted by lesser. The opening into this room is as noble as that from the cloister. The stone
<PB N="79" REF="91"/>
roof is destroyed, and one of plank is substituted. The central pillar remains, light, slender, and elegant, surrounded by eight others; bound by two equidistant <HI>fasciae,</HI> and terminated in capi∣tals of beautiful simplicity. By consent of the abbot, in 1377, the commons of <HI>Great Britain</HI> first held their parlements in his place; the crown undertaking the repairs. Here they sat till the year 1547, when <HI>Edward</HI> VI. granted the chapel of <HI>St. Stephen</HI> for that purpose. It is at present filled with the public records, among which is the original <HI>Domesday</HI> book, now above seven hundred years old: it is in as fine preservation as if it was the work of yesterday.</P>
<P>BENEATH the chapter-house is a very singular crypt. The roof, which forms the floor of the former, is supported by a short round pillar, quite hollow. The top spreads into massy plain ribs, the supports of the roof. The walls are not less than eighteen feet thick, and form a most firm base to the superstructure. They had been pierced with several small windows, which are now lost by the vast increase of earth on the outside <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This crypt is only accessible through the house of Mr. <HI>Barrow.</HI></NOTE>; one is just visible in the garden belonging to Mr. <HI>Barrow.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Jerusalem</HI> chamber was part of the abbot's lodgings; and built by <HI>Littlington.</HI> It is noted for having been the place where <HI>Henry</HI> IV. breathed his last: he had been seized with a swoon while he was paying before the shrine of <HI>St. Edward;</HI> and, being carried into this room, asked, on recovering, where he was? being informed, he answered, (I will speak his reply in the words of <HI>Shakespear,</HI> borrowed from history)
<Q><PB N="80" REF="92"/>
<L>Laud be to God!—even there my life must end.</L>
<L>It hath been prophesied to me many years</L>
<L>I should not die but in <HI>Jerusalem,</HI></L>
<L>Which vainly I suppos'd the HOLY LAND!</L></Q>
The devil is said to have practised such a delusion on pope <HI>Sylvester</HI> II. having (on consultation) assured his holiness that he should die in <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> and kept his word, by taking him off as he was saying mass, in 1003, in a church of that name in <HI>Rome</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Brown</HI>'s <HI>Fasciculus,</HI> i. 83, 88.</NOTE>.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">SANCTUARY.</NOTE>NOT far from the abby stood the <HI>Sanctuary,</HI> the place of refuge absurdly indulged, in old times, to criminals of certain denomina∣tions. The church belonging to it was in form of a cross, and double; one being built over the other. Such is the account that Doctor <HI>Stukely</HI> gives of it, for he remembered it standing <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Archaelogia,</HI> i. p. &amp; tab. 39.</NOTE>: it was of vast strength; and was with much labor demolished. It is supposed to have been the work of the <HI>Confessor.</HI> Within its precincts was born <HI>Edward</HI> V; and here his unhappy mother took refuge, with her younger son <HI>Richard,</HI> to secure him from his cruel uncle, who had already possession of the elder brother. Seduced by the persuasions of the duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> archbishop of <HI>York,</HI> she surrendered the little innocent, who was instantly carried to his brother in the <HI>Tower,</HI> where they were soon after involved in one common fate.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="93"/>TO the west of the sanctuary stood the <HI>Eleemosynary</HI> or <HI>Almory,</HI> where the alms of the abby were wont to be distributed. But it is still more remarkable for having been the place where the first printing press ever known in <HI>England</HI> was erected. It was in the year 1474; when <HI>William Caxton,</HI> probably encouraged by the learned <HI>Thomas Milling,</HI> then abbot, produced <HI>The Game and Play of the Chesse,</HI> the first book ever printed in these kingdoms. There is a slight difference about the place in which it was printed, but all agree that it was within the precincts of this reli∣gious house. Would the monks have permitted this, could they have foreseen how certainly the art would conduce to their overthrow, by the extension of knowlege, and the long-concealed truths of Christianity?</P>
<P>BENEATH the shadow of the abby stands the church of <HI>St. Mar∣geret,</HI> built originally by <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor.<NOTE PLACE="marg">ST. MARGARET'S CHURCH.</NOTE> The parish church had been in the abby, to the great inconveniency of the monks. It was rebuilt in the time of <HI>Edward</HI> I. and again in that of <HI>Edward</HI> IV. This church is honored with the remains of the great Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh,</HI> who was interred here on the same day on which he was beheaded in <HI>Old Palace Yard.</HI> It was left to a sensible churchwarden to inform us of the fact, who in∣scribed it on a board, about twenty years ago.</P>
<P>THE east window is a most beautiful composition of figures.<NOTE PLACE="marg">ITS FINE WIN∣DOW.</NOTE> It was made by order of the magistrates of <HI>Dort,</HI> and by them designed as a present to <HI>Henry</HI> VII; but he dying before it was finished, it was put up in <HI>Waltham</HI> abby: there it remained till the dissolution; when it was removed to <HI>Newhall</HI> in <HI>Essex,</HI> afterwards part of the estate of general <HI>Monk,</HI> who preserved it from demoli∣tion. In 1758 it was purchased from the then owner by the in∣habitants
<PB N="82" REF="94"/>
of the parish for four hundred guineas. By the opposi∣tion and absurdity of a cotemporary prebend, this fine ornament run a great risque of being pulled down again. The subject is the crucifixion; a devil is carrying off the soul of the hardened thief; an angel receiving that of the penitent. Silly enough! but the other beauties of the piece might surely have moved the reverend zealot to mercy. The figures are numerous, and finely done. On one side is <HI>Henry</HI> VI. kneeling; above him his patron saint, <HI>St. George.</HI> On the other side is his queen in the same atti∣tude, and above her the fair <HI>St. Catherine</HI> with the instruments of her martyrdom. This charming performance is engraved at the cost of the Society of Antiquaries.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">PALACE AT WESTMINSTER.</NOTE>THE royal palace which clames seniority in our capital, was that of <HI>Westminster,</HI> founded by the <HI>Confessor,</HI> who was the first prince who had in it regular residence. It stood near the <HI>Thames:</HI> the stairs to it on the river still keep the name of <HI>Palace stairs;</HI> and the two <HI>Palace Yards</HI> were also belonging to this extensive pile.</P>
<P>THE <HI>New Palace Yard</HI> is the area before the hall. In old times a very handsome conduit, or, as it was called, fountain, graced one part: and opposite to the hall, on the site of the present pas∣sage into <HI>Bridge-street,</HI> stood a lofty square tower, which, from its use, was called the <HI>Clock Tower.</HI> This may be seen in <HI>Hollar</HI>'s print, N<SUP>o</SUP> 6, and in the old plan of <HI>London,</HI> as it was in the be∣ginning of the reign of queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">WESTMINSTER-HALL.</NOTE>MANY parts of this antient palace exist to this day, sunk into other uses. Succeeding monarchs added much to it. The great hall was built by <HI>William Rufus,</HI> or possibly rebuilt; a great hall being too necessary an appendage to a palace, ever to have been
<PB N="83" REF="95"/>
neglected. The entrance into it from <HI>New Palace Yard,</HI> was bounded on each side by towers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Kip</HI> has given a view of it, N<SUP>o</SUP> 40.</NOTE>, most magnificently ornamented with numbers of statues in rows above each other, now lost, or concealed by modern buildings; a mutilated figure of an armed man, supposed to have been one, was discovered under the Ex∣chequer staircase in 1781 <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Carter</HI>'s antient sculptures, N<SUP>o</SUP> 1.</NOTE>. The size may be estimated, when we are told that <HI>Henry</HI> III. entertained in this hall, and other rooms, six thousand poor men, women, and children, on new-year's day, 1236. It became ruinous before the reign of <HI>Richard</HI> II. who rebuilt it in its present form in 1397; and in 1399 kept his <HI>Christmas</HI> in it, with his characteristical magnificence. Twenty-eight oxen, three hundred sheep, and fowls without number, were daily consumed. The number of his guests each day were ten thousand. We need not wonder then, that <HI>Richard</HI> kept two thousand cooks. They certainly were deeply learned in their profession; witness <HI>The Forme of Cury,</HI> compiled about 1390, by the master cooks of this luxurious monarch, in which are pre∣served receits for the most exquisite dishes of the time. This book was printed by the late worthy <HI>Gustavus Brander,</HI> <ABBR>esq</ABBR> with an excellent preface by that able antiquary the reverend Mr. <HI>Pegge.</HI> Mr. <HI>Brander</HI> favored me with a copy: but, excepting a magician of <HI>Laputa</HI> could conjure up a few of <HI>Richard</HI>'s cooks, I despair of ever treating my brethren with a feast <HI>à l'antique.</HI></P>
<P>THIS room exceeds in dimension any in <HI>Europe,</HI> which is not supported by pillars; its length is two hundred and seventy feet; the breadth seventy-four. Its height adds to its solemnity. The

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">PARLEMENTS HELD IN IT.</NOTE>PARLEMENTS often sat in this hall. In 1397, when, in the reign of <HI>Richard</HI> II. it was extremely ruinous, he built a temporary room for his parlement, formed with wood, and covered with tiles. It was open on all sides, that the constituents might see every thing that was said and done: and, to secure freedom of debate, he sur∣rounded the house with four thousand <HI>Cheshire</HI> archers, with bows bent, and arrows nocked ready to shoot <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Stow</HI>'s <HI>Survaie,</HI> 888, 889.</NOTE>. This fully answered the intent: for every sacrifice was made to the royal pleasure.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">COURTS OF IUSTICE.</NOTE>COURTS of justice, even in early times, sat in this hall, where monarchs themselves usually presided; for which reason it was called <HI>Curia Domini Regis,</HI> and one of the three now held in this hall is called the court of king's-bench. The first chief justice was <HI>Robert Le Brun,</HI> appointed by <HI>Henry</HI> III. The judges of the courts were made knights bannerets, and had materials given them for making most sumptuous habits for the occasion. Among others, they had for a cloak cxx bellies of <HI>minever pure,</HI> i. e. the ermine, which they retain to this day; but I observe green to be the predominant color of their robes. The judges in old times rode to court: at first on mules; but in the reign of queen <HI>Mary,</HI> they changed those restive animals for easy pads.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHARLES I. TRIED HERE.</NOTE>THE solemn trial of <HI>Charles</HI> I. was held in this hall, before a packed court of judicature: during the intervals of this mockery of justice, he was carried to the neighboring house belonging to Sir <HI>Thomas Cotton,</HI> in which a room was fitted up by Mr. <HI>Kinner∣sley,</HI> a servant of the king's, belonging to the wardrobe. This was
<PB N="85" REF="97"/>
the residence of his father, Sir <HI>Robert,</HI> the famous antiquary, and owner of the noble collection of manuscripts, which, with great public spirit, he got together and secured for ever to the use of his country. They were at first kept in <HI>Cotton-house,</HI> which was purchased by the crown. They were afterwards removed to another house in <HI>Westminster,</HI> and finally deposited in the <HI>British Museum.</HI> Let me add, that the room in which the books were originally lodged, had been the oratory of <HI>Edward</HI> the Con∣fessor.</P>
<P>THE house of lords is a room ornamented with the tapestry which records our victory over the <HI>Spanish Armada.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">HOUSE OF LORDS.</NOTE> It was be∣spoke by the earl of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> lord high admiral, and comman∣der in chief on the glorious day. The design was drawn by <HI>Cornelius Vroom,</HI> and the tapestry executed by <HI>Francis Spiering. Vroom</HI> had a hundred pieces of gold for his labor. The arras it∣self cost £. 1628. It was not put up till the year 1650, two years after the extinction of monarchy, when the house of lords was used as a committee-room for the house of commons. The heads of the naval heroes who commanded on the glorious days, form a matchless border round the work, animating posterity to emulate their illustrious example!</P>
<P>IN the <HI>Prince</HI>'s chamber, where his majesty puts on his robes when he comes to the house of lords, is a curious old tapestry, representing the birth of queen <HI>Elizabeth. Anne Bullen</HI> in her bed; an attendant on one side, and a nurse with the child on the other. The story is a little broken into by the loss of a piece of the <HI>Arras,</HI> cut to make a passage for the door. But beyond is <HI>Henry</HI> with his courtiers; one of which seems dispatched to bring
<PB N="86" REF="98"/>
back intelligence about the event. On the south side of this room are three <HI>gothic</HI> windows.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">COURT OF REQUESTS.</NOTE>THE court of requests is a vast room modernized; at present a mere walking-place. The outside of the south end shews the great antiquity of the building, having in it two great round arches, with zigzag mouldings, our most antient species of archi∣tecture. This court has its name because the <HI>masters</HI> of it here received the petitions of the subjects to the king, in which they <HI>requested</HI> justice; and the masters advised the suppliants how they were to proceed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Coke</HI>'s Inst. iv. c. 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THAT court of justice so tremendous in the <HI>Tudor</HI> and part of the <HI>Stuart</HI> reign, the <HI>Star Chamber,</HI> still keeps its name; which was not taken from the <HI>stars</HI> with which its roof was said to have been painted (which were obliterated even before the reign of queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>), but from the <HI>Starra</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">From the <HI>Hebrew, Shetàr.</HI></NOTE>, or <HI>Jewish</HI> covenants, which were deposited there by order of <HI>Richard</HI> I. in chests under three locks.

In the reigns of <HI>Henry</HI> VII. and VIII. a new-modelled court was erected here, consisting of divers lords spiritual and temporal, with two judges of the courts of common law, with the intervention of a jury <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Blackstone,</HI> book iv. c. 19.</NOTE>.

the great joy of the whole nation. The room is now called the <HI>Painted Chamber,</HI> and is used as the place of conference between the lords and commons. It makes a very poor appearance, being hung with very antient <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Arras</HI> tapestry, which, by the names worked over the figures, seems to relate to the <HI>Trojan</HI> war. The windows are of the antient simple <HI>gothic.</HI> On the north outside, beyond the windows, are many marks of recesses, groins, arms, on the remains of some other room.</P>
<P>NUMBERS of other great apartments are still preserved on each side of the entrance into <HI>Westminster-hall,</HI> in the law court of ex∣chequer, and adjacent; and the same in the money exchequer, and the dutchy of <HI>Lancaster:</HI> all these had been the parts of the antient palace.</P>
<P>AT the foot of the staircase is a round pillar, having on it the arms of <HI>John Stafford,</HI> lord treasurer from 1422 to 1424.

To this day, the manner in which Providence directed the discovery is un∣known. The plot evidently was confined to a few persons of des∣perate zeal and wickedness: they did not dare to trust so dreadful a design to the multitude. The success, they knew, must be fol∣lowed with a general insurrection, and completion of their wishes. The opportunity would have been too irresistible, even to those

who, in cool blood, would have rejected with horror a plan so truly diabolical.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">HOUSE OF COM∣MONS, ONCE ST. STEPHEN'S CHAPEL.</NOTE>THE commons of <HI>Great Britain</HI> hold their assemblies in this place, which was built by king <HI>Stephen,</HI> and dedicated to his namesake the protomartyr. It was beautifully rebuilt by <HI>Edward</HI> III. in 1347, and by him made a collegiate church, and a dean and twelve secular priests appointed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Newcourt,</HI> i. 745.</NOTE>. Soon after its surrender to <HI>Edward</HI> VI. it was applied to its present use. The revenues at that period were not less than £. 1085 a year.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">WEST FRONT.</NOTE>THE west front, with its beautiful <HI>gothic</HI> window, is still to be seen as we ascend the stairs to the court of requests; it consists of the sharp-pointed species of <HI>gothic.</HI> Between it and the lobby of the house is a small vestibule of the same sort of work, and of great elegance. At each end is a <HI>gothic</HI> door, and one in the middle, which is the passage into the lobby. On the south side of the outmost wall of the chapel, appear the marks of some great <HI>gothic</HI> windows, with abutments between; and beneath, some lesser windows, once of use to light an under chapel.

<P>THE far greater part of the under-chapel of <HI>St. Stephen,</HI> is pos∣sessed by his grace the duke of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> as auditor of the ex∣chequer. One side of the cloister is entirely preserved,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BEAUTIFUL CLOISTER.</NOTE> by being found convenient as a passage: the roof is <HI>gothic</HI> workmanship, so elegant as not to be paralleled even by the beautiful workmanship in the chapel of <HI>Henry</HI> VII. Several parts are walled up for the meanest uses; even a portion serves, with its rich roof, for a coal-hole. That which has the good fortune to be allotted for the steward's room, is very well kept. In one part of the roof is cut a neat, and, I believe, true representation of the front of the cha∣pel, bounded on each side by a turret. Another of the same kind, held by an angel, appears on the wall.</P>
<P>ON one side of the cloister,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SMALL ORATORY AND CHAUNTRY.</NOTE> projects into the area a small ora∣tory, as richly ornamented as other parts of this building: above is a neat chauntry in the same style. A gallery runs over each side of the cloister, with windows of light stone tracery, looking into the court or area, which is deformed by a modern kitchen and its appendages.</P>
<P>FROM one part of the gallery is a stairs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ANTIENT SQUARE TOWER.</NOTE> which leads to a very antient square tower of stone, standing almost close to the side of <HI>Westminster-hall.</HI> It probably was a belfry, to hold the bells that roused the holy members of the chapel to prayer.</P>
<P>IN what is called the grotto room,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SCULPTURES OF ST. STEPHEN.</NOTE> are fine remains of the roof and columns of this sub-chapel. The roof is spread over with ribs of stone, which rest on the numerous round pillars that compose the support. The pillars are short; the capitals round

and small, with a neat foliage intervening. In a circle on the roof, is a martyrdom of <HI>St. Stephen,</HI> cut in stone. In another circle, is a representation of <HI>St. John</HI> the <HI>Evangelist</HI> cast into a cauldron of boiling oil, by command of the emperor <HI>Domitian.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">WOOL-STAPLE.</NOTE>NOT far from <HI>Westminster-hall,</HI> in <HI>New Palace Yard,</HI> stood the staple of wool, removed to <HI>Westminster,</HI> and several other places in <HI>England,</HI> in 1353, by <HI>Edward</HI> III. These before had been kept in <HI>Flanders:</HI> but this wise measure brought great wealth into the kingdom, and a considerable addition to the royal revenue: for the parlement in those days granted to the king a certain sum on every sack exported. <HI>Henry</HI> VI. had six wool-houses here, which he granted to the dean and canons of <HI>St. Stephen</HI>'s <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Strype</HI>'s <HI>Stow,</HI> ii. book vi. p. 7.</NOTE>. The concourse of people, which this removal of the wool-staple to <HI>Westminster</HI> occasioned, caused this royal village to grow into a considerable town: such is the superiority of commerce. Part of the old gate∣way to the staple was in being as late as the year 1741, when it was pulled down to make room for the abutment of the new bridge <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Anderson</HI>'s <HI>Dict.</HI> i. 184.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">WESTMINSTER BRIDGE.</NOTE>THE first stone of that noble structure was laid on <HI>January</HI> 24th, 1739, by <HI>Henry</HI> earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> a nobleman, of whom Mr. <HI>Walpole</HI> says, none had a purer taste in architecture.

found with the great height of the balustrades, which deny to the passengers a clear view of the noble expanse of water, and the fine objects, especially to the east, which are scattered with no sparing hand.

<P>THE tide has been known to rise at this bridge twenty-two feet;<NOTE PLACE="marg">TIDE.</NOTE> much to the inconveniency of the inhabitants of the lower parts of <HI>Westminster,</HI> for at such times their cellars are laid under water; but its height depends much on the force and direction of the wind at the time of flood.</P>
<P>BEYOND this palace, to the north,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CANON, OR CHANNEL ROW.</NOTE> stood some streets and lanes by the water-side, distinguished in older times by the residence of some of our nobility.

<P>HENRY had an uncommon composition: his savage cruelty could not suppress his love of the arts: his love of the arts could not soften his savage cruelty. The prince who could, with the utmost <HI>sang froid,</HI> burn Catholics and Protestants, take off the heads of the partners of his bed one day, and celebrate new nup∣tials the next, had, notwithstanding, a strong taste for refined plea∣sures. He cultivated architecture and painting, and invited from abroad artists of the first merit. To <HI>Holbein</HI> was owing the most beautiful gate at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> built with bricks of two colors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">FINE GATE.</NOTE> glaz∣ed, and disposed in a tesselated fashion. The top, as well as that of an elegant tower on each side, were embattled. On each front were four busts in baked clay, in proper colors, which re∣sisted to the last every attack of the weather: possibly the arti∣ficial stone revived in this century. These, I have been lately informed, are preserved in a private hand. This charming struc∣ture fell a sacrifice to conveniency within my memory: as did another in 1723, built at the same time, but of far inferior beau∣ty <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Both these gates are engraven in plates xvii.xviii. of the <HI>Vetusta Monumenta,</HI> published by the Society of Antiquaries—and also by <HI>Kip.</HI></NOTE>. The last blocked up the road to <HI>King-street,</HI> and was called <HI>King's-gate. Henry</HI> built it as a passage to the park, the tennis-court, bowling-green, the cock-pit, and tilting-yard; for he was extremely fond of athletic exercises; they suited his strength and his temper.</P>
<P>IT was the intention of <HI>William</HI> duke of <HI>Cumberland,</HI> to re∣build the beautiful gate, first mentioned, at the top of the long

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">TILT-YARD.</NOTE>THE tilt-yard was equally the delight of his daughter <HI>Eliza∣beth,</HI> as singular a composition: for, with the truest patriotism, and most distinguished abilities, were interwoven the greatest va∣nity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">VANITY OF QUEEN ELIZA∣BETH.</NOTE> and most romantic disposition.

A <HI>Dutch</HI> ambassador assured her majesty, that he had undertaken the voyage to see her majesty, who for <HI>beauty</HI> and wisdom excelled all other <HI>beauties</HI> in the world. She labored at an audience to make <HI>Melvil</HI> acknowlege that his charming mistress was inferior in beauty to herself <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Memoirs,</HI> 98.</NOTE>.

So fond was she of dress, that three thousand different habits were found in her wardrobe after her death. Mortifying reflection! in find∣ing such alloy in the greatest characters.</P>
<P>SHE was very fond of dancing. I admire the humour she shewed in using this exercise, whenever a messenger came to her from her successor <HI>James</HI> VI. of <HI>Scotland:</HI> for Sir <HI>Roger Aston</HI> assures us, that whenever he was to deliver any letters to her from his master, on lifting up of the hangings, he was sure to find her dancing to a little fiddle, affectedly, that he might tell <HI>James,</HI> by

<P>LITTLE did <HI>James</HI> think that he was erecting a pile from which his son was to step from the throne to the scaffold.

earthly stage. This passage still remains, at the north end of the room, and is at present the door to a small additional building of late date.

<P>IN 1680 a complete plan of this great palace was taken by <HI>John Fisher,</HI> and engraven by <HI>Vertue,</HI> in 1747.<NOTE PLACE="marg">PLAN OF WHITEHALL.</NOTE> It appears that extended along the river, and in front along the present <HI>Parlement</HI> and <HI>Whitehall</HI> street, as far as <HI>Scotland Yard;</HI> and on the other side of those streets to the turning into <HI>Spring Garden,</HI> beyond the <HI>Admiralty,</HI> looking into <HI>St. James</HI>'s <HI>Park.</HI> The merry king, his queen, the royal brother, prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> the duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> and all the great officers, and all the courtly train, had their lodg∣ings within these walls; and all the royal family had their diffe∣rent offices, such as kitchens, cellars, pantries, spiceries, cyder-house, bake-house, wood-yards and coal-yards, and slaughter-house. We see among the fair attendants of queen <HI>Catherine,</HI> many names which make a great figure in <HI>Grammont,</HI> and other chronicles of the time: such as the countess of <HI>Castlemaine,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Kirk,</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Killegrew.</HI> As to <HI>Nell Gwynne,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">NELL GWYNNE.</NOTE> not having the honor to be on the good queen's establishment, she was obliged to keep her distance, at her house in what was then called <HI>Pall-mall.</HI> It is the first good one on the left hand of <HI>St. James</HI>'s <HI>Square,</HI> as we enter from <HI>Pall-mall.</HI> The back room on the ground floor was (within memory) entirely of looking glass; as was said to have been the cieling.

<P><PB N="102" REF="118"/>I MUST not omit, that from the palace into the <HI>Thames</HI> were two stairs, one public, the other the privy stairs for the use of majesty alone; the first is still in use, the other is made up in the old wall adjacent to the earl of <HI>Fife</HI>'s, but the arch of the portal remains entire. <HI>Henry,</HI> and his daughter <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> made all their parties by water or on horseback; or now and then the last went mounted on a litter, carried on men's shoulders. Coaches had been introduced into <HI>England</HI> by <HI>Henry Fitzalan</HI> earl of <HI>Arundel,</HI> one of her admirers; but the spirited princess seems to have dis∣dained the use.

<P>NO one is unacquainted with the noble and commodious im∣provements which succeeded.

On the quarrel between the great earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> and lord <HI>Cromwel,</HI> about the cause of the first battle of <HI>St. Albans;</HI> lord <HI>Cromwel,</HI> fearing the rage of that violent peer, was at his own desire lodged here, by way of security, by <HI>John Talbot</HI> earl of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> at that time lord treasurer of <HI>England</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Fenn</HI>'s Letters, i. 110.</NOTE>. It was surrendered to <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. in
<PB N="107" REF="124"/>
1531, who sounded on its site the present palace, which <HI>Stowe</HI> calls a goodly manor. His majesty also inclosed the park, which was subservient to the amusement of this and the palace of <HI>White∣hall. Charles</HI> II. was particularly fond of it, planted the avenues, made the canal, and the aviary, adjacent to the <HI>Bird-cage walk,</HI> which took its name from the cages which were hung in the trees. <HI>Charles,</HI> says <HI>Cibber,</HI> was often seen here, amidst crowds of specta∣tors, feeding his ducks, and playing with his dogs <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Apology for the life of <HI>Colley Cibber,</HI> 26.</NOTE>, and passing his idle moments in affability even to the meanest of his subjects, which made him to be adored by the common people; so fasci∣nating in the great are the habits of condescension!</P>
<P>DUCK ISLAND was erected into a government, and had a salary annexed to the office, in favor of <HI>M. St. Evremond,</HI> who was the first and perhaps the last governor <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">S. Pegge, <ABBR><HI>esq</HI></ABBR></NOTE>: and the island itself is lost in the late improvements.</P>
<P>IT does not appear that the palace was inhabited by any of our monarchs till after the fire at <HI>Whitehall. James</HI> I. presented it to his accomplished son <HI>Henry,</HI> who resided here till his lamented death in 1612. <HI>Charles</HI> I. was brought here from <HI>Windsor,</HI> on <HI>January</HI> 19th <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Whitelock.</NOTE>, by the power of the army, which had determined on his death; his apartment was hastily furnished by his servant Mr. <HI>Kinnersley,</HI> of the wardrobe <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Herbert</HI>'s Memoirs, 106.</NOTE>. Some of the eleven days which he was permitted to live, were spent in <HI>Westminster-hall,</HI> and of the nights in the house of Sir <HI>Robert Cotton,</HI> adjacent to his place of trial. On the 27th he was carried back to <HI>St. James</HI>'s, where he passed his three last days in exemplary piety. On the 30th he
<PB N="108" REF="125"/>
was brought to the place of execution; and walked, unmoved at every insult, with a firm and quick pace, supported by the most lively sentiments of religion.</P>
<P>HIS son, the bigoted <HI>James,</HI> sent to the prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> when he had approached in force near to the capital, a most necessitated invitation to take his lodgings at this palace. The prince ac∣cepted it: but at the same time hinted to the frightened prince that he must leave <HI>Whitehall.</HI> It was customary to mount guard at both the palaces. The old hero lord <HI>Craven</HI> was on duty at the time when the <HI>Dutch</HI> guards were marching through the park to relieve, by order of their master. From a point of honor he had determined not to quit his station, and was preparing to maintain his post; but, receiving the command of his sovereign, he reluctantly withdrew his party and marched away with sullen dignity <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dalrymple</HI>'s Memoirs.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>DURING the reign of king <HI>William, St. James's</HI> was fitted up for the residence of the princess <HI>Anne</HI> (afterwards queen) and her spouse prince <HI>George</HI> of <HI>Denmark.</HI> From that time to the present it has been regularly the court of our monarchs.</P>
<P>JAMES, the son of <HI>James</HI> II. who so long made pretensions to the <HI>British</HI> throne, was born in the room now called the old bed-chamber; at present the anti-chamber to the levee room. The bed stood close to the door of a back-stairs, which descended to an inner court. It certainly was very convenient to carry on any secret design; and might favor the silly warming-pan story, was not the bed surrounded by twenty of the privy-council, four other men of rank, twenty ladies, besides pages and other atten∣dants.
<PB N="109" REF="126"/>
<HI>James,</HI> with imprudent pride, neglected to disprove the tale: it was adopted by party, and firmly believed by its zealots. But, as <HI>James</HI> proved false to his high trust, and his son shewed every symptom of following his example, there was certainly no such pretence wanting for excluding a family inimical to the in∣terests of the GREAT WHOLE.</P>
<P>UNCREDITABLE as the outside of <HI>St. James</HI>'s palace may look, it is said to be the most commodious for regal parade of any in <HI>Europe.</HI> Every one knows that the furniture of this palace is un∣becoming the place.<NOTE PLACE="marg">PORTRAITE.</NOTE> Yet in a ramble I once made through the apartments, I saw several portraits of personages remarkable in their day. Among others (in one of the rooms behind the levee rooms) is a small full-length of <HI>Henry</HI> prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> son of <HI>James</HI> I. He is dressed in green, standing over a dead stag, and sheathing a sword. A youth, the accomplished lord <HI>Harrington,</HI> of <HI>Exton,</HI> is kneeling before him: each of them have hunting horns, and behind the prince is a horse, and on the bough of a tree are the arms of <HI>England,</HI> and behind the young lord, another coat of arms, perhaps his own. Another fine small piece, of <HI>Arthur,</HI> elder brother to <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. painted very young, with a bonnet on his head. <HI>Henry</HI> stands by him, and his sister <HI>Margaret,</HI> of in∣fant ages. This picture is by <HI>Mabuse,</HI> who visited <HI>England</HI> in the reign of their father.</P>
<P>HENRY VII. and VIII. full-lengths, and each of them with a queen before an altar. The fortunate <HI>Jane Seymour</HI> (who died in her bed) is the consort of the son, here represented. This is a copy from <HI>Holbein,</HI> in small, by <HI>Van Lemput</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n 1667, taken by order of <HI>Charles</HI> II. The original was painted on the wall in the privy chamber of <HI>Whitehall,</HI> and destroyed in the fire of 1697.</P>

<P>A CHILD in the robes of the garter: perhaps the youngest knight known. He was the second son of <HI>James</HI> II. while duke of <HI>York,</HI> by <HI>Anne Hyde</HI> his dutchess. On <HI>December</HI> 3d, 1666, he was elected knight of the garter, at the age of three years and five months. The sovereign put the <HI>George</HI> round his neck; and prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> the garter round his little leg. Death, in the fol∣lowing year, prevented his installation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sandford,</HI> 677.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE diminutive manhood of the dwarf <HI>Geoffry Hudson,</HI> is to be seen in another picture. He appears less by being placed walk∣ing under some very tall trees.</P>
<P>IN the lords old waiting-room is <HI>Henry Darnley,</HI> in black, tall and genteel. His hand is resting on his brother <HI>Charles Stuart,</HI> earl of <HI>Lenox,</HI> dressed in a black gown.</P>
<P>IN another room is <HI>Charles</HI> II. of <HI>Spain,</HI> at the age of four, in black, with a sceptre in his hand, strutting and playing the mo∣narch. He was inaugurated in 1665. His reign was unhappy. <HI>Spain</HI> at no period was in so low, so distressful a condition. His dominions were parcelled out in his life-time: but he disappointed the allies, and, after some struggle, the designation of his will in favor of the house of <HI>Bourbon</HI> took place.</P>
<P>HERE is to be seen the famous picture by <HI>Mabuse,</HI> of <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve.</HI> Mr. <HI>Evelyn</HI> justly remarks the absurdity of painting them with navels, and a fountain with rich imagery amidst the beauteous wilds of paradise. <HI>Raphael,</HI> and <HI>Michael Angelo,</HI> made
<PB N="111" REF="128"/>
the same mistake of the navel, on which the learned Sir <HI>Thomas Brown</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vulgar Errors,</HI> p. 194.</NOTE> wastes a long page and a half to disprove the pos∣sibility.</P>
<P>IN the queen's library (built by queen <HI>Caroline,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">QUEEN'S LIBRARY.</NOTE> and ornamented by <HI>Kent</HI>) now a lumber-room, I saw a beautiful view from <HI>Greenwich</HI> park, with <HI>Charles</HI> I. his queen, and a number of cour∣tiers, walking. And two others, of the same prince and his queen dining in public. And another of the elector palatine and his spouse at public table; with a carver, looking most ridiculous, a monkey having in that moment reared from the board and seized on his beard. Possibly this feast was at <HI>Guildhall,</HI> where he was most nobly entertained by the hospitable city, in 1612, when he made the match with the daughter of our monarch, which ended so unhappily for both parties.</P>
<P>TO the east of <HI>St. James</HI>'s palace, in the reign of queen <HI>Anne,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">MARLBOROUGH-HOUSE.</NOTE> was built <HI>Marlborough-house,</HI> at the expence of the public. It appears by one of <HI>Kip</HI>'s views of <HI>St. James</HI>'s, published before the existence of this house, that it was built in part of the royal gardens, granted for that purpose by her majesty. The present duke added an upper story, and improved the ground floor, which originally wanted the great room. This national compliment cost not less than forty thousand pounds.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Pall-mall</HI> the duke <HI>Schomberg</HI> had his house.<NOTE PLACE="marg">PALL-MALL.</NOTE> It was in my time possessed by <HI>Astley</HI> the painter, who divided it into three, and most whimsically fitted up the center for his own use.</P>
<P>TO take a review of the space between this palace and <HI>Charing-Cross,</HI> as it was about the year 1560, it will appear a tract of
<PB N="112" REF="129"/>
fields; there were no houses, excepting three or four on the east side of the present <HI>Pall-mall:</HI> and a little farther, on the opposite side, a small church, the name of which I cannot discover.</P>
<P>BY the year 1572, <HI>Cockspur-street</HI> filled up the space between those houses and <HI>Charing-Cross. Pall-mall</HI> was also laid out as a walk, or a place for the exercise of the <HI>Mall,</HI> a game long since disused. The north side was also planted with a row of trees. On the other side was the wall of <HI>St. James</HI>'s park. <HI>Charles</HI> II. removed it to its present place, planted the park, and made all those improvements, which we now see. It was <HI>Le Notre,</HI> the famous <HI>French</HI> gardener, the director of taste under <HI>Louis</HI> XIV. who ordered the disposition of the trees. Of late, the <HI>French</HI> have endeavoured to borrow taste from us. In the days of <HI>Charles,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">HAYMARKET. HEDGE-LANE.</NOTE> the <HI>Haymarket,</HI> and <HI>Hedge-lane,</HI> had names; but they were literally lanes, bounded by hedges; and all beyond, to the north, east, and west, was entirely country. In the fine plan of <HI>London,</HI> published by <HI>Faithorn,</HI> in 1658, no traces of houses are to be met with in the former, any more than a single one, named the <HI>Gaming-house,</HI> at the end next to <HI>Piccadilly. Windmill-street</HI> consisted of disjoined houses; and a windmill, standing in a field on the west side, proves from what its name was derived. All the space occupied by the streets radiating from the <HI>Seven Dials,</HI> was at that period open ground.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">LEICESTER-HOUSE.</NOTE><HI>Leicester-fields</HI> was also unbuilt; but the house of that name is found in the same plan, and on the site of the present. It was founded by one of the <HI>Sydnies</HI> earls of <HI>Leicester.</HI> It was for a short time the residence of <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> daughter of <HI>James</HI> I. the titular queen of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> who, on <HI>February</HI> 13th, 1661, here
<PB N="113" REF="130"/>
ended her unfortunate life <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sandford,</HI> 565.</NOTE>. It has been tenanted for a great number of years. It was successively the pouting-place of princes. The late king, when prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> after he had quarrelled with his father, lived here several years. His son <HI>Frederick</HI> followed his example, succeeded him in his house, and in it finished his days. No one is ignorant of the magnificent and instructive museum exhibited in this house by the late Sir ASHTON LEVER. It was the most astonishing collection of the subject of natural history ever collected, in so short a space, by any individual. To the disgrace of our kingdom, after the first burst of wonder was over, it became neglected: and when it was offered to the public, by the chance of a guinea lottery, only eight thou∣sand, out of thirty-six thousand, tickets were sold. Finally, the capricious goddess frowned on the spirited possessor of such a number of tickets, and transferred the treasure to the possessor of only two, Mr. <HI>Parkinson;</HI> who, by his spirited attention to, and elegant disposition of the <HI>Museum,</HI> well merited the favor.</P>
<P>BEHIND <HI>Leicester-house</HI> stood, in 1658, the Military-yard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE MILITARY YARD.</NOTE> founded by <HI>Henry</HI> prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> the spirited son of our peace∣ful <HI>James.</HI> M. <HI>Foubert</HI> afterwards kept here his academy for rid∣ing and other gentleman-like exercises, in the reign of <HI>Charles</HI> II. It is to this day a noted riding-school.</P>
<P>A LITTLE beyond stood <HI>Gerard-house,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">GERARD-HOUSE.</NOTE> the habitation of the gallant <HI>Gerard</HI> earl of <HI>Macclesfield</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Journey to <HI>London.</HI></NOTE>.

of <HI>Hamilton.</HI> I have heard that his good lady was vastly dis∣pleased at the bloody corse being flung upon the best bed.</P>
<P>COVENTRY-HOUSE stood near the end of the <HI>Haymarket,</HI> and gave name to <HI>Coventry-street.</HI> It was the residence of lord keeper <HI>Coventry;</HI> and <HI>Henry Coventry,</HI> secretary of state, died here in 1686.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">PICCADILLY.</NOTE>LORD <HI>Clarendon</HI> mentions a house of this name, in the follow∣ing words.
<Q>Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> (says he, speaking of himself) going to a house called <HI>Piccadilly,</HI> which was a fair house for entertain∣ment, and gaming, with handsome gravel-walks with shade, and where were an upper and lower bowling-green, whither very many of the nobility and gentry of the best quality re∣sorted for exercise and conversation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Clarendon</HI>'s Hist. <HI>Oxford</HI> ed. 1705, i. 241, <HI>sub</HI> anno 1640.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>AT the upper end of the <HI>Haymarket,</HI> stood <HI>Piccadilla-hall,</HI> where <HI>Piccadillas</HI> or <HI>Turn-overs</HI> were sold, which gave name to that vast street, called from that circumstance <HI>Piccadilly.</HI> This street was completed in 1642, as far as the present <HI>Berkeley-street.</HI> The first good house which was built in it was <HI>Burlington-house;</HI> the noble founder, father to the late earl of <HI>Burlington,</HI> said he placed it there
<Q>because he was certain no one would build be∣yond him.</Q>
Nobody is ignorant of the vast town that, since that period, has extended itself beyond this palace. After this rose <HI>Clarges-house,</HI> and two others adjacent, inhabited, says <HI>Strype,</HI> by lord <HI>Sherbourne</HI> and the countess of <HI>Denby.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Pest-house-fields</HI> were surrounded with buildings before the year 1700, but remained a dirty waste till of late years, when
<PB N="115" REF="132"/>
<HI>Carnaby-market</HI> occupied much of the west part. <HI>Golden-square,</HI> of dirty access, was built after the Revolution, or before 1700. In these fields had been the <HI>lazareto,</HI> during the period of the dreadful plague of the year 1665. It was built by that true hero lord <HI>Craven,</HI> who stayed in <HI>London</HI> during the whole time; and braved the fury of the pestilence, with the same coolness as he fought the battles of his beloved mistress <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> titular queen of <HI>Bohemia;</HI> or mounted the tremendous breach at <HI>Creutz∣nach.</HI> He was the intrepid soldier, the gallant lover, the genuine patriot.</P>
<P>IN 1700 <HI>Bond-street</HI> was built no farther than the west end of <HI>Clifford-street. New Bond-street</HI> was at that time an open field, called <HI>Conduit Mead,</HI> from one of the conduits which supplied this part of the town with water: and <HI>Conduit-street</HI> received its name for the same reason.</P>
<P>GEORGE-<HI>street, Hanover-square,</HI> and its church, rose about the same time. The church was built by <HI>John James,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ST. GEORGE's, HANOVER-SQUARE.</NOTE> and finished in 1724. Its portico would be thought handsome had you space to admire it. It now looks <HI>Brobdignagian.</HI> This was one of the fifty new churches, and the parish stolen out of that of <HI>St. Mar∣tin in the Fields.</HI> It is the last parish in this part of <HI>Westminster,</HI> excepting the distant <HI>Mary-bonne.</HI> Every part besides was open ground, covered with dunghills, and all sorts of obscenity. <HI>May Fair</HI> was kept about the spot now covered with <HI>May Fair</HI> chapel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MAY FAIR.</NOTE> and several fine streets. The fair was attended with such disor∣ders, riots, thefts, and even murders, that, in 1708, it was pre∣sented by the magistrates. It revived again, and I remember the last celebrations: the place was covered with booths, temporary theatres, and every enticement to low pleasure.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="133"/>AT the time of Sir <HI>Thomas Wiat</HI>'s insurrection, in <HI>February,</HI> 1554, part of the army marched to make their attack on <HI>London</HI> over this tract, then an open country as far as <HI>Charing-Cross.</HI> On the spot called <HI>Hay-hill,</HI> near the present <HI>Berkeley-square,</HI> there was a skirmish between a party of the insurgents and another of the royal army, in which the former were repulsed. After the execution of Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> his head (on that account) was set up on a gallows, at that place <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Strype</HI>'s Memorials, iii. 120.</NOTE>, and his parboiled quarters in different parts of the neighborhood of the capital. Three of the insurgents were also hung in chains near the head of their leader.</P>
<P>THIS extensive tract, at present a vast seat of the most elegant population, is far from being destitute of places of devotion: but chapels arose instead of churches, subordinate to their respective rectors. In this enlightened age it was quickly discovered that "Godliness was profitable to many." The projector, the archi∣tect, the mason, the carpenter, and the plasterer united their powers. A chapel was erected, well-pewed, well-warmed, dedi∣cated, and consecrated. A captivating preacher is provided, the pews are filled, and the good undertakers amply repayed by the pious tenantry.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">HANOVER AND CAVENDISH SQUARES.</NOTE>IN 1716, <HI>Hanover-square,</HI> and <HI>Cavendish-square,</HI> were unbuilt: but their names appear in the plans of <HI>London</HI> of 1720. <HI>Oxford-street,</HI> from <HI>Princes-street</HI> eastward as far as <HI>High-street St. Giles</HI>'s, was almost unbuilt on the north side. I remember there a deep hollow road, and full of sloughs: there was here and there a rag∣ged house, the lurking-place of cut-throats: insomuch that I never was taken that way by night, in my hackney-coach, to a

Originally the square was called, in honor of him, <HI>Monmouth-square;</HI> and afterwards changed to that of <HI>King-square.</HI> I have a tradition, that, on his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ath, the ad∣mirers of that unfortunate man changed it to <HI>Soho,</HI> being the word of the day at the field of <HI>Sedgemoor.</HI> The house was pur∣chased by the late lord <HI>Bateman,</HI> and let by the present lord to the <HI>Comte de Guerchy,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> ambassador.

<P>AFTER this digression, let me return into <HI>Piccadilly.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BERKELEY-HOUSE.</NOTE>—Before the date of <HI>Burlington-house,</HI> was built a fine mansion, belonging to the <HI>Berkelies,</HI> lords, and afterwards earls <HI>Berkeley.</HI> It stood be∣tween the south end of <HI>Berkeley-square</HI> and <HI>Piccadilly,</HI> and gave name to the square and an adjacent street. The misery and dis∣grace which the profligacy of one of the daughters brought on the house, by an intrigue with her brother-in-law, lord <HI>Grey,</HI> (afterwards engaged in the <HI>Monmouth</HI> rebellion) is too lastingly recorded in our <HI>State Trials,</HI> ever to be buried in oblivion.</P>
<P>ON the site of this house, fronting <HI>Piccadilly,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">DEVONSHIRE-HOUSE.</NOTE> stands <HI>Devonshire-house;</HI> long after the year 1700 it was the last house in this street, at that time the portion of <HI>Piccadilly.</HI> The old house, which was built by the first duke, was burnt in the reign of <HI>George</HI> II.

<HI>Lort,</HI> at that time librarian; to whose liberal communications I have been invariably indebted. The portraits are so numerous in this noble house, that I must leave the complete list to those who have more opportunities of forming it than I had. Among others, is a fine portrait of <HI>Marc Antonio de Dominis,</HI> the vain de∣sultory archbishop of <HI>Spalato,</HI> who, abjuring the <HI>Roman</HI> catholic religion, came over to <HI>England,</HI> and was appointed master of the <HI>Savoy.</HI> He had not been here long, but he publicly retracted all he had wrote against the church of <HI>Rome. James</HI> ordered him to depart the kingdom in three days. He had the folly to trust himself at <HI>Rome;</HI> where, his sincerity being doubted, he was flung into prison, where he ended his days. He is painted by <HI>Tin∣toret,</HI> represented in his study, sitting, in black, and with a square cap.</P>

<P>HYDE-PARK was in the late century, and the early part of the present, celebrated, by all our dramatical poets, for its large space railed off in form of a circle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE RING.</NOTE> round which the <HI>Beau-monde</HI> drove in their carriages, and in their rotation; exchanging as they passed smiles and nods, compliments, or smart repartees.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="138"/>OPPOSITE to this hospital at <HI>Hyde-park Corner,</HI> stood a large fort with four bastions, which formed one of the many flung up in the year 1642.

This was occasioned by an alarm of an attack from the royal army. Men, women, and children assisted by thousands.

<P>THERE were a few more great houses,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BERKSHIRE, OR CLEVELAND-HOUSE.</NOTE> not remote from <HI>St. James</HI>'s palace, which merit mention. <HI>Berkshire-house,</HI> belonging to the <HI>Howards,</HI> earls of <HI>Berkshire,</HI> stood very near the royal resi∣dence.

Even the virtuous lord <HI>Russel</HI> committed in this cause the single opprobrium of his life: when the unhappy lord was condemned, RUSSEL could wish to deny the king the amiable prerogative of taking away the cruel, the disgraceful part of the penalty.

The court had use for so complete a villain, and sunk follow as to apply to his grace for pardon for the offence against him; the duke granted it with a generous indignation. <HI>Blood</HI> had a pension of five hundred a year, and was constantly seen in the presence-chamber: as is supposed, to shew to the great un∣complying men of the time, what a ready instrument the ministry had to revenge any attempt that might be made against them in the cause of liberty.</P>
<P>I WOULD not make this little work a <HI>Tyburn</HI> chronicle;<NOTE PLACE="marg">MURDER OF MR.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">THE STRAND; ITS ANTIENT STATE.</NOTE>THE further progress of this part of the town I shall defer mentioning till I have reached the most eastern part of <HI>Westmin∣ster.</HI> I shall resume my account at the opening of the <HI>Strand</HI> into <HI>Charing-Cross,</HI> by observing, that in the year 1353, that fine
<PB N="127" REF="144"/>
street the <HI>Strand</HI> was an open highway, with here and there a great man's house, with gardens to the water-side. In that year it was so ruinous, that <HI>Edward</HI> III. by an ordinance directed a tax to be raised upon wool, leather, wine, and all goods carried to the staple at <HI>Westminster,</HI> from <HI>Temple-bar</HI> to <HI>Westminster-abbey,</HI> for the repair of the road; and that all owners of houses adjacent to the highway should repair as much as lay before their doors. Mention is also made of a bridge to be erected near the royal pa∣lace at <HI>Westminster,</HI> for the conveniency of the said staple <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rymer</HI>'s <HI>Foedera,</HI> v. 762.</NOTE>: but the last probably meant no more than a stairs for the landing of the goods, which I find sometimes went by the name of a bridge.</P>
<P>THERE are several instances of grants for building, in this ex∣tensive road, in very early times. <HI>Edward</HI> I. granted to <HI>Walter le Barbur,</HI> a void space in the high-street, in the parish of <HI>St. Clement Danes</HI> and <HI>St. Mary Strand:</HI> and <HI>Robert le Spencer</HI> had from the same prince another grant.</P>
<P>THERE was no continued street here till about the year 1533:<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE STREET COMPLETED IN 1533.</NOTE> before that, it entirely cut off <HI>Westminster</HI> from <HI>London,</HI> and no∣thing intervened except the scattered houses, and a village which afterwards gave name to the whole. <HI>St. Martin</HI>'s stood literally in the fields. But about the year 1560 a street was formed, loosely built; for all the houses on the south side had great gardens to the river, were called by their owners names, and in after-times gave name to the several streets that succeeded them, pointing down to the <HI>Thames;</HI> each of them had stairs for the conveniency of tak∣ing boat, of which many to this day bear the names of the houses. As the court was for centuries, either at the palace at <HI>Westminster</HI>
<PB N="128" REF="145"/>
or <HI>Whitehall,</HI> a boat was the customary conveyance of the great to the presence of their sovereign. The north side was a mere line of houses from <HI>Charing-Cross</HI> to <HI>Temple-bar;</HI> all beyond was country. The gardens which occupied part of the site of <HI>Convent-garden</HI> were bounded by fields, and <HI>St. Giles</HI>'s was a distant coun∣try village. These are circumstances proper to point out, to shew the vast increase of our capital in little more than two centuries.</P>
<P>IN the same century was a second epoch respecting the build∣ings of this part of the town.

Our capital found itself so secure in the glorious government of <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> that, by the year 1600, most considerable additions were made to the north of the long line of street just described. <HI>St. Martin's-lane</HI> was built on both sides. <HI>St. Giles</HI>'s church was still insulated: but <HI>Broad street,</HI> and <HI>Holborn,</HI> were completely formed into streets with houses, all the way to <HI>Snow-hill.

It was early bestowed on the abbot and convent of <HI>St. Peter, Westminster.</HI> In 1222, there was a dispute between the abbot and the city of <HI>London,</HI> about the jurisdiction of this church. And in 1363, we first find the name of a vicar, in room of <HI>Thomas Skyn,</HI> who had resigned. In the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. a small church was built here at the king's expence, by reason of the poverty of the parishioners, who possibly were at that period very few. In 1607 it was enlarged, because of the increase of build∣ings. In 1721 it was found necessary to take the whole down, and in five years from that time, this magnificent temple <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It is engraven by <HI>H.

This seems the best performance of <HI>Gibbs,</HI> the architect of the <HI>Ratcliff Library.</HI> The steeple is far the most elegant of any of that style which I named the <HI>Pepper-box;</HI> and with which (I beg pardon of the good people of <HI>Glasgow</HI>) I marked their boasted steeple of <HI>St. Andrew.</HI></P>

Mary le Strand,</HI> was a very antient church and parish, a rectory, in the gift of the bishops of <HI>Worcester,</HI> who had near it their inn, or town residence.

Every one of these were levelled to the ground by the protector <HI>Somerset,</HI> to make way for the magnificent palace which bears his name.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SOMERSET-HOUSE.</NOTE> The architect is supposed to have been one <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Padua,</HI> who had a salary in the preceding reign, under the title of <HI>devizor of his majesty's buildings</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Anecdotes of Painting, i. 114.</NOTE>, which was continued to him in the reign of the son. No atonement was made, no compensation to the owners. Part of the church of <HI>St. John of Jerusalem,</HI> and the tower, were blown up for the sake of the materials. The cloisters on the north side of <HI>St. Paul</HI>'s underwent the same fate, together with the charnel-house and chapel: the tombs were destroyed, and the bones impiously carried away and flung into <HI>Finsbury Fields.</HI> This was done in 1549, when the building was first be∣gan: possibly the founder never enjoyed the use of this palace;
<PB N="140" REF="158"/>
for in 1552 he fell a just victim on the scaffold. The crime of sacrilege is never mentioned among the numerous articles brought against him. This is no wonder, since every great man in those days, protestant and papist, shewed equal rapacity after the goods of the church.</P>
<P>AFTER his death his palace fell to the crown. Queen <HI>Eliza∣beth</HI> lived here at certain times, most probably at the expence of her kinsman lord <HI>Hunsdon,</HI> to whom she had given the use. <HI>Anne</HI> of <HI>Denmark</HI> kept her court here: and <HI>Catherine</HI> queen of <HI>Charles</HI> II. lived here for some time in the life of her unfaithful spouse; and after his death, till she retired into her native country.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">ANTIENT B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ING.</NOTE>THE architecture of old <HI>Somerset-house</HI> was the mixture of <HI>Gre∣cian</HI> and <HI>Gothic,</HI> introduced into <HI>England</HI> in the reign preceding its erection. The back-front, and the water-gate, were built from a design of <HI>Inigo Jones,</HI> after the year 1623. A chapel was be∣gun by him in that year, and afterwards finished. It was intended for the use of his catholic spouse the <HI>Infanta</HI> of <HI>Spain;</HI> but, on the failure of that romantic match, it served for the uses of the profes∣sors of her religion.</P>
<P>AS <HI>Charles</HI> II. did not find it compatible with his gallantries that his spouse <HI>Catherine</HI> should be resident at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> he lodged her, during some part of his reign, in this palace. This made it the haunt of the Catholics: and possibly, during the phrenetic rage of the nation at that period against the professors of her religion, occasioned it to have been made the pretended scene of the murder of Sir <HI>Edmonbury Godfrey,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">MURDER OF SIR EDMONBURY GODFREY.</NOTE> in the year 1678. The infamous witnesses against his supposed murderers declared, that he was waylaid, and inveigled into the palace, under pre∣tence
<PB N="141" REF="159"/>
of keeping the peace between two servants who were fight∣ing in the yard: that he was there strangled, his neck broke, and his own sword run through his body: that he was kept four days before they ventured to remove him; at length, his corpse was first carried in a sedan-chair to <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho,</HI> and then on a horse to <HI>Primrose-hill,</HI> between <HI>Kilburn</HI> and <HI>Hampstead.</HI> There it certainly was found, transfixed with the sword, and his money in his pocket, and his rings on his fingers. The murder therefore was not by robbers, but the effect of private revenge: but it is not probable that it was committed within these walls; for the assassins would never have hazarded a discovery by carrying the corpse three miles, when they could have so safely disposed of it into the <HI>Thames.</HI> The abandoned characters of the evidences, <HI>Prance</HI> and <HI>Bedloe</HI> (the former of whom had been treated with most horrid cruelties, to compel him to confess what he declared he never was guilty of) together with the absurd and irreconcileable testi∣mony they gave on the trial, has made unprejudiced times to doubt the whole. That he was murdered there is no doubt: he had been an active magistrate, and had made many enemies. The marks of strangling round his throat, and his broken neck, evince the impossibility of his having put an end to his own ex∣istence, as some have insinuated. But the innocence of the three poor convicts would not avail, the torrent of prejudice prevaling against them; and they were executed, denying the facts in the moment of death. One was a Protestant: the other two <HI>Roman Catholics,</HI> and belonging to the chapel; so probably were fixed on, by the instigators of the accusation, in order to involve the queen in the uncharitable suspicion.</P>

This gate is the western limit of <HI>Farringdon Ward Without,</HI> or the western extremity of the city of <HI>London.</HI> On the right hand are the entrances into the <HI>Temple,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">THE TEMPLE.</NOTE> one of our celebrated seats of law, which took its name from that gallant religious military order the <HI>knights templars.</HI> They were originally <HI>crusaders,</HI> who hap∣pening to be quartered in places adjacent to the holy temple in <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> in 1118, consecrated themselves to the service of reli∣gion, by deeds of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Newcourt</HI>'s <HI>Repertorium,</HI> i. 589,</NOTE> arms. <HI>Hugo de Paganis, Geoffry</HI> of <HI>St. Omers,</HI> and seven others, began the order, by binding themselves, after the manner of the regular canons of <HI>St. Augustines,</HI> to chastity and obedience, and professing to protect the pilgrims to the <HI>Holy Land</HI> from all wrong and robbery on the road. At first they subsisted on alms, and had only one horse between two of them; a rule was appointed for them, and they wore a white habit, af∣terwards distinguished by a red cross on their left shoulder. By
<PB N="149" REF="167"/>
their devotion, and the fame of their gallant actions, they became very popular in all parts of <HI>Europe;</HI> and so enriched by the favor of princes, and other great men, that, at the time of their dissolu∣tion, the order was found possessed of sixteen thousand manors. It became at last so infected with pride, and luxury,<NOTE PLACE="marg">FALL OF THE KNIGHTS TEMPLARS.</NOTE> as to excite general hatred; a persecution, founded on most unjust and ficti∣tious accusations, was formed against them in <HI>France,</HI> under <HI>Philip le Bel.</HI> Their riches seem to have been their chief crime: num∣bers of innocent and heroic knights suffered in the flames, with the piety and constancy of martyrs; some of them, at the stake, sum∣moned their chief enemies, <HI>Clement</HI> V. and <HI>Philip,</HI> to appear in a certain time at the divine tribunal; both of those princes died about the time prescribed, which, in an age of superstition, proved the validity. This potent order came into <HI>England</HI> in the reign of king <HI>Stephen,</HI> and had their first house in <HI>Holborn,</HI> which was called the <HI>Old Temple.</HI> They founded the <HI>New Temple</HI> in 1185, where they continued till the suppression of the order in 1310, when they were condemned to perpetual penance, and dispersed into several monasteries. <HI>Edward</HI> II. granted this house, and all their other possessions in <HI>London,</HI> to <HI>Thomas</HI> earl of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> and, after his rebellion and forfeiture, to <HI>Aymer de Valence,</HI> earl of <HI>Pem∣broke;</HI> on his death, they reverted to the crown, and were given to the knights hospitallers of the order of <HI>St. John</HI> of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> a few years after they had so valiantly driven the <HI>Turks</HI> out of the isle of <HI>Rhodes.</HI> These knights again granted the Temple to the students of the common law, in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> III. to whose use it has been ever since applied.</P>
<P>THE church was founded by the templars in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> II. upon the model of that of the holy sepulchre,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ITS ROUND CHURCH.</NOTE> and was
<PB N="150" REF="168"/>
consecrated in 1185, by <HI>Heraclius,</HI> patriarch of <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> The entrance is through a door with a <HI>Saxon</HI> arch. Within, the form is circular, supported by six round arches, each resting on four round pillars, bound together by a fascia. Above each arch is a window with a rounded top, with a gallery, and rich <HI>Saxon</HI> arches intersecting each other. On the outside of the pillars is a considerable space, preserving the circular form. On the lower part of the wall are small pilasters meeting in pointed arches at top, and over each pillar a grotesque head.</P>
<P>JOINED to this building, is a large choir of a square form, with narrow <HI>gothic</HI> windows, evidently built at another time. On the outside is a buttress between every window.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">MONUMENTS.</NOTE>ON the floor of the round church are two groups of knights. In the first are four, each of them cross-legged, three of them in complete mail, in plain helmets flatted at top, and with very long shields. One is known to have been <HI>Geoffry de Magnaville,</HI> created earl of <HI>Essex</HI> in 1148. His end was singular; for, driven to despair by the injustice of his monarch king <HI>Stephen,</HI> he gave loose to every act of violence. He was mortally wounded at an attack of <HI>Burwel castle,</HI> in <HI>Cambridgeshire;</HI> and, being found by some templars, was dressed by them in the habit of the order and carried from the spot: as he died excommunicated, they wrapped his body in lead, and hung it on a crooked tree in the Temple orchard. On being absolved by the pope (it being proved that he expressed great penitence in his last moments) he was taken down, and buried first in the cemetery, and afterwards in the place where we find this memorial of him <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ugh</HI>'s Monum. i. 24. tab. v.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="169"/>ONE of these figures is singular, being bare-headed, and bald, his legs armed, his hands mailed, his mantle long, round his neck a cowl, as if, according to a common superstition in early days, he had desired to be buried in the dress of a monk, least the evil spirit should take possession of his body. On his shield are three <HI>fleurs de lis.</HI></P>
<P>IN this group is a stone coffin of a ridged shape, conjectured to have been the tomb of <HI>William Plantagenet,</HI> fifth son of <HI>Henry</HI> III.</P>
<P>IN the second group are other figures, but none of them cross-legged, except the outmost: all are armed in mail. The helmets much resemble the former, but two are mailed. One figure is in a spirited attitude, drawing a broad dagger; one leg rests on the tail of a cockatrice, the other in the action of being drawn up, with the head of the monster beneath. None of the eight figures, except <HI>Geoffry de Magnaville,</HI> are ascertained; but <HI>Cambden</HI> con∣jectures that three are intended to commemorate <HI>William</HI> earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> who died in 1219, and his sons <HI>William</HI> and <HI>Gilbert,</HI> likewise earls of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> and <HI>Marshals</HI> of <HI>England</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cambden,</HI> i. 382.—The others are engraven in plate xix.</NOTE>. In the first group, one of them bears a lion on his shield, the arms of that great family. <HI>Gilbert</HI> was brought up to the church, and, notwithstanding he was totally unskilled in exercises of chivalry, would enter into the gallant lists; but mounting a fiery courser, was run away with, flung off, and killed, at a tournament at <HI>Ware,</HI> in 1242.</P>
<P>THE being represented cross-legged is not always a proof of the deceased having had the merit either of having been a <HI>cru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sa∣der,</HI>
<PB N="152" REF="170"/>
or having made a pilgrimage to the holy sepulchre. I have seen, at <HI>Mitton</HI> in <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> two figures of the <HI>Sherbornes,</HI> thus represented; one died in 1629, the other in 1689: who, I ve∣rily believe, could never have had any more than a wish to enter the holy land.</P>
<P>TO these antient monuments may be added that of a bishop, in his episcopal dress, a mitre, and a crosier, well executed in stone.</P>
<P>OF illustrious persons of later date, is the famous <HI>Plowden,</HI> a <HI>Shropshire</HI> man, treasurer of this society in 1572, and a lawyer of most distinguished abilities. <HI>Cambden</HI> says of him, that in inte∣grity he was second to none of his profession. His figure is re∣presented recumbent, and in his gown.</P>
<P>HERE is interred the celebrated <HI>Selden,</HI> who died in 1654. He was the best skilled in the constitution, and the various branches of antiquity, of any man. Yet, towards the close of his life, he was so thoroughly convinced of the vanity of all human knowlege, as to say, that the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th verses of the second chapter of the epistle to <HI>Titus,</HI> afforded him more solid consola∣tion than all that he had ever read.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>John Vaughan,</HI> born at <HI>Trawscoed,</HI> in <HI>Cardiganshire,</HI> lies near his friend Mr. <HI>Selden:</HI> both their principles were anti-monar∣chical. After the Restoration, he declined preferment offered by the chancellor <HI>Clarendon,</HI> but afterwards accepted the office of chief justice of the common pleas, from the enemies of that illus∣trious character. He died in 1674.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">HALL.</NOTE>THE magnificent hall was rebuilt in the treasurership of <HI>Plow∣den.</HI> It is ornamented with paintings by Sir <HI>James Thornhill:</HI> and by two full-length portraits of those pillars of the law,

<P>THE account of the great feast given in this hall, by the ser∣jeants, in 1555, is extremely worth consulting <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Origines Judiciales, <HI>128.</HI></NOTE>; and also of the hospitable Christmassings of old times. <HI>Dudley</HI> earl of <HI>Leicester</HI> once enjoyed them, and, with the romance of his mistress, styled himself <HI>Palaphilos,</HI> prince of <HI>Sophie.</HI> He was entertained here by a person representing a sovereign prince. <HI>Palaphilos,</HI> on seeing him, calls <HI>Largess,</HI> and receives instantly a chain of the value of a hundred talents. I must refer to the <HI>Origines Judiciales</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">156.</NOTE> for the relation of the ceremony of the reign of the Lord of <HI>Misrule,</HI> and of his courtiers, Sir <HI>Francis Flatterer,</HI> Sir <HI>Randle Rackabite,</HI> and Sir <HI>Bartholomew Baldbreech;</HI> with the humour of hunting the fox and the cat round the hall, with ten couples of hounds, and all the other merry disports of those joyous days.</P>
<P>IN the parlement chamber are painted all the arms of the trea∣surers, since the first who possessed the office. It is also adorned with some of <HI>Gibbon</HI>'s carving.</P>
<P>THE Middle Temple gate was erected by Sir <HI>Amias Powlet,</HI> on a singular occasion. It seems that Sir <HI>Amias,</HI> about the year 1501, thought fit to put cardinal <HI>Wolsey,</HI> then parson of <HI>Lymington,</HI> into the stocks <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Fiddes</HI>'s life of cardinal <HI>Wolsey,</HI> 7.</NOTE>. In 1515, being sent for to <HI>London,</HI> by the cardinal, on account of that antient grudge, he was commanded not to quit town till farther orders. In consequence, he lodged five or six years <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Holinshed,</HI> 918, who calls him Sir <HI>James.</HI> He was ancestor of earl <HI>Powlet.</HI></NOTE> in this gateway, which he rebuilt; and, to pacify his emi∣nence,

adorned the front with the cardinal's cap, badges, cogni∣sance, and other devices, of this butcher's son: so low were the great men obliged to stoop to that meteor of the times <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This gate was burnt in the great fire.</NOTE>!</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">THE TEMPLE GARDEN.</NOTE>THE garden has of late been most judiciously enlarged, by a considerable embankment into the river; and part of the filthy muddy shore is converted into a most beautiful walk.

<P>OPPOSITE to this noted house is <HI>Chancery-lane,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHANCERY-LANE.</NOTE> the most antient of any to the west.

<P>SERJEANTS-INN is the first which opens into the lane:<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERJEANTS-INN.</NOTE> it takes its name from having been in old times the residence or lodgings of the serjeants at law, as early at lest as the time of <HI>Henry</HI> VI.

He bestowed one half of their effects on the first preachers, who undertook the trouble of converting the unbelieving race; and the other half for the support of the con∣verts: the house was called <HI>Domus Conversorum.</HI> In 1377, it was first applied to its present use: and the master was called <HI>Custos Rotulorum:</HI> the first was <HI>William Burstal,</HI> clerk. The masters were selected out of the church, and often king's chaplains, till the year 1534, when <HI>Thomas Cromwel,</HI> afterwards earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> was appointed. It is an office of high rank, and follows that of chief justice of the king's bench. The master has his chaplain, and his preacher.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAPEL.</NOTE>THE chapel is adjacent to the house, and was built by <HI>Inigo Jones;</HI> begun in 1617, and finished at the expence of two thou∣sand pounds.

His hair is short; his beard long, and divided towards the end; his dress a long furred robe.

<P>THE monument of <HI>John Yonge,</HI> D. L. L. is the work of <HI>Tor∣regiano</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Walpole.</HI></NOTE>.

The other parts were rebuilt at different times, but much about the same period. None of the original building is left, for it was formed out of the house of the <HI>Black Friars,</HI> which fronted <HI>Hol∣born;</HI> and of the palace of <HI>Ralph Nevil,</HI> chancellor of <HI>England,</HI> and bishop of <HI>Chichester,</HI> built by him in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> III. on a piece of ground granted to him by the king. It continued to be inhabited by some of his successors in the see. This was the original site of the <HI>Dominicans,</HI> or <HI>Black Friars,</HI> before they removed to the spot now known by that name.

built an <HI>Inne,</HI> as it was in those days called, for himself, in which he died in 1312. The ground did belong to the <HI>Black Friars,</HI> and was granted by <HI>Edward</HI> I. to that great earl. The whole has retained his name. One of the bishops of <HI>Chichester,</HI> in after times, did grant leases of the buildings to certain students of the law, reserving to themselves a rent and lodgings for them∣selves, whenever they came to town.

In antient times it was customary to present to malefactors, on their way to the gallows (which, about the year 1413, was removed from <HI>Smithfield,</HI> and placed between <HI>St. Giles</HI>'s <HI>High-street,</HI> and <HI>Hog-lane</HI>) a great bowl of ale, as the last refreshment they were to receive in this life <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Newcourt,</HI> i. 611.</NOTE>.

the tenets of <HI>Wycliffe.</HI> He was misrepresented to our heroic prince, <HI>Henry</HI> V. by the bigoted clergy, as a heretic and traitor; and that he was actually at the head of thirty thousand <HI>Lollards,</HI> in these very fields. About a hundred inoffensive people were found there: <HI>Cobham</HI> escaped; but was taken some time after in <HI>Wales.</HI> He suffered death on this spot: was hung on a gallows, by a chain fastened round his body, and, thus suspended, burnt alive. He died, not with the calm constancy of a martyr, but with the wildest effusions of enthusiastic ravings.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHURCH.</NOTE>THIS church was rebuilt in 1625. By the amazing raising of the ground by filth, and various adventitious matter, the floor, in the year 1730, was eight feet below the surface acquired in the intervening time. This alone made it necessary to rebuild the church, in the present century. The first stone was laid in 1730; it was finished in 1734, at the expence of ten thousand pounds, in a manner which does great credit to its architect, Mr. <HI>Henry Flitcraft.</HI></P>
<P>IN the church-yard I have observed with horror a great square pit, with many rows of coffins piled one upon the other, all ex∣posed to sight and smell. Some of the piles were incomplete, expecting the mortality of the night. I turned away disgusted at the view, and scandalized at the want of police, which so little re∣gards the health of the living as to permit so many putrid corpses, tacked between some flight boards, dispersing their dangerous effluvia over the capital.</P>
<P>NEAR the church was the house of <HI>Alice</HI> dutchess <HI>Dudley,</HI> who died here in 1669, aged ninety. She was the widow of the great Sir <HI>Robert Dudley,</HI> son to <HI>Robert</HI> earl of <HI>Leicester,</HI> who, by various untoward circumstances, was denied legitimacy, and his paternal

estates. He assumed the title of duke of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and lived and died in great estimation in <HI>Tuscany.</HI> This lady was ad∣vanced to the title of dutchess by <HI>Charles</HI> I. She merited the honor by the greatness of her mind and extent of her charities. Her body was interred at <HI>Stonely,</HI> in <HI>Warwickshire,</HI> the place of her family, she being third daughter of Sir <HI>Thomas Leigh,</HI> of <HI>Stonely,</HI> ancestor of the late lord <HI>Leigh.</HI> A fine monument was erected to her honor at <HI>Stonely</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Dugdale</HI>'s <HI>Warwickshire,</HI> i, 260; in which is a print of the tomb, and a list of her great charities.</NOTE>, and a grateful memorial of her in this church.</P>
<P>THE mention of <HI>St. Giles</HI>'s <HI>bowl,</HI> naturally brings one to the late place of the conclusion of human laws. It was called in the time of <HI>Edward</HI> III. when the gentle <HI>Mortimer</HI> finished his days here, <HI>The Elms;</HI> but the original as well as present name was <HI>Tybourne,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">TYBOURNE.</NOTE> not from <HI>tye</HI> and <HI>burn,</HI> as if it was called so from the manner of capital punishments, but from <HI>Bourne,</HI> the <HI>Saxon</HI> word for a brook, which gave name to a manor before the Conquest. Here was also a village and church denominated <HI>St. John the Evangelist,</HI> which fell to decay, and was succeeded by that of <HI>Mary bourne,</HI> corrupted into <HI>Mary-la-bonne.</HI> About the year 1238, this brook furnished nine conduits for supplying the city with water: but the introduction of the New River superseded the use of them. Here the lord mayor had a banquetting-house, to which his lordship and brethren were wont to repair on horseback, attended by their ladies in waggons: and, after viewing the conduits, they returned to the city, where they were magnificently entertained by the lord mayor <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Maitland,</HI> ii. 1373.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="182"/>IN 1626, queen <HI>Henrietta Maria</HI> was compelled by her priests to take a walk, by way of penance, to <HI>Tyburn.</HI> What her offence was we are not told; but <HI>Charles</HI> was so disgusted at this inso∣lence, that he soon after sent them, and all her majesty's <HI>French</HI> servants, out of the kingdom <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Whitelock,</HI> 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I SHALL return through the mile and a quarter of country, at this time formed into <HI>Oxford-street,</HI> as handsome a one as any in <HI>Europe,</HI> and, I believe, the longest.

It was of brick, and ornamented with fluted pilasters. On the top was a great reservoir, as a guard against fire, and it also served as a fish-pond. This house was pulled down and the ground granted on building leases.</P>

On the tower is a pyramid, at each corner of which are the supporters of <HI>England,</HI> a lion and an unicorn alternate, the first with its heels upwards: and the pyramid finishes with the statue of <HI>George</HI> I.

<P>WE now enter again on the stormy latitude of the law. <HI>Lin∣coln's-Inn</HI> is left a little to the south. <HI>Chancery-lane</HI> gapes on the same side, to receive the numberless <HI>malheureuses,</HI> who plunge un∣warily on the rocks and shelves with which it abounds.

He died in 1667, barely in pos∣session of the white rod, which his profligate enemies were with difficulty dissuaded from wresting out of his dying hands. He had the happiness of marrying his daughter and heiress to a nobleman of congenial merit, the ill-fated lord <HI>Russel.</HI> Her virtues underwent a fiery trial, and came out of the test, if possible, more pure. I cannot read of her last interviews with her devoted lord, without the strongest emotions. Her greatness of mind ap∣pears to uncommon advantage. The last scene is beyond the power of either pen or pencil. In this house they lived many years. When his lordship passed by it in the way to execution, he felt a momentary bitterness of death in recollecting the happy moments of the place.

He died by the hand of <HI>Ralph Haywood,</HI> a gentleman who had passed most of his days in his lordship's service. For some reason unknown, he had left him out of his will, and was weak enough to let him know of it. In <HI>September,</HI> 1628, <HI>Haywood</HI> entered into his lord's bed∣chamber, and, expostulating with great warmth on the usage he met with, his lordship answering with asperity, received from him a mortal wound with a sword. The assassin retired into ano∣ther room, in which he instantly destroyed himself with the same instrument.

<P>THE several buildings belonging to this palace falling into ruin, it was thought proper to enable, by act of parlement, in 1772, the bishop to alienate the whole.

Out of the first, five thousand six hundred was applied towards the purchase of <HI>Albemarle-house,</HI> in <HI>Dover-street,</HI> with other messuages and gar∣dens.

<P><PB N="174" REF="192"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">PLACE FOR TOURNAMENTS;</NOTE>FOR a long series of reigns, <HI>Smithfield</HI> was the field of gallant tilts and tournaments: and also the spot on which accusations were decided by duel, derived from the <HI>Kamp-fight</HI> ordeal of the <HI>Saxons.</HI> Here, in 1374, the doating hero <HI>Edward</HI> III. in his sixty-second year, infatuated by the charms of <HI>Alice Pierce,</HI> placed her by his side in a magnificent car, and, styling her the <HI>Lady of the Sun,</HI> conducted her to the lifts, followed by a train of knights, each leading by the bridle a beautiful palfrey, mounted by a gay damsel: and for seven days together exhibited the most splendid justs in indulgence of his disgraceful passion.</P>
<P>HIS grandson, <HI>Richard</HI> II. in the same place held a tourna∣ment equally magnificent.
<Q>There issued out of the <HI>Towre</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> says the admiring <HI>Froissart,</HI> "fyrst threescore coursers apparelled for the justes, and on every one a squyer of honour riding a soft pase.

I refer to my author <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Froissart,</HI> tom iv. ch. xxii. Lord <HI>Berner</HI>'s translation, ii. p. ccix.</NOTE> for the rest of the relation of this splendid spectacle; certainly there was a magnificence and spirit of gal∣lantry in the dissipation of those early times, which cherished a warlike and generous spirit in the nobility and gentry of the land. Something like is now arising, in the brilliant societies of archers in most parts of <HI>Britain,</HI> which, it is to be hoped, will at lest share the hours consumed in the enervated pleasures of music; or the dangerous waste of time in the hours dedicated to cards.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">FOR TRIALS BY DUEL;</NOTE>I WILL not trespass on my readers patience any more on this subject, than just to mention one instance of duel. It was when
<PB N="175" REF="193"/>
the unfortunate Armourer entered into the lists, on account of a false accusation of treason, brought against him by his apprentice, in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VI. The friends of the defendant had so plied him with liquor, that he fell an easy conquest to his accuser. <HI>Shakespear</HI> has worked this piece of history into a scene, in the second part of <HI>Henry</HI> VI. but has made the poor Armourer con∣fess his treasons in his dying moments: for in the time in which this custom prevaled, it never was even suspected but that guilt must have been the portion of the vanquished. Let me add, that when people of rank fought with sword and lance, <HI>Plebeian</HI> com∣batants were only allowed a pole, armed with a heavy sand-bag, with which they were to decide their guilt or innocence.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Smithfield</HI> was also held our <HI>Autos de Fè;</HI> but,<NOTE PLACE="marg">FOR EXECUTIONS.</NOTE> to the credit of our <HI>English</HI> monarchs, none were ever known to attend the ceremony. Even <HI>Philip</HI> II. of <HI>Spain</HI> never honored any, of the many which were celebrated by permission of his gentle queen, with his presence, notwithstanding he could behold the roasting of his own subjects with infinite self-applause, and <HI>sang-froid.</HI> The stone marks the spot, in this area, on which those cruel exhibitions were executed. Here our martyr <HI>Latimer</HI> preached patience to friar <HI>Forest,</HI> agonizing under the torture of a slow fire, for denying the king's supremacy: and to this place our martyr <HI>Cranmer</HI> com∣pelled the amiable <HI>Edward,</HI> by forcing his reluctant hand to the warrant, to send <HI>Joan Bocher,</HI> a silly woman, to the stake. Yet <HI>Latimer</HI> never thought of his own conduct in his last moments; nor did <HI>Cranmer</HI> thrust his hand into the fire for a real crime, but for one which was venial through the frailty of human nature.</P>
<P>THE last person who suffered at the stake in <HI>England</HI> was <HI>Bar∣tholomew Legatt,</HI> who was burnt here in 1611, as a blasphemous
<PB N="176" REF="194"/>
heretic, according to the sentence pronounced by <HI>John King,</HI> bishop of <HI>London.</HI> The bishop consigned him to the secular arm of our monarch <HI>James,</HI> who took care to give to the sentence full effect <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See part iv. of the history of the first fourteen years of king <HI>James.</HI></NOTE>.—This place, as well as <HI>Tyburn,</HI> was called <HI>The Elms,</HI> and used for the execution of malefactors even before the year 1219.—In the year 1530, there was a most severe and singular punishment inflicted here on one <HI>John Roose,</HI> a cook, who had poisoned seventeen persons of the bishop of <HI>Rochester</HI>'s family, two of whom died. By a retrospective law, he was sentenced to be boiled to death, which was done accordingly.—In 1541, <HI>Mar∣g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ret Davie,</HI> a young woman, suffered in the same place and manner, for the same species of crime.—In <HI>Smithfield</HI> the arch∣rebel <HI>Wat Tyler</HI> met with, in 1381, the reward of his treason and insolence. The youthful king, no longer able to bear his bruta∣lity, ordered him to be arrested; when the gallant <HI>Walworth,</HI> lord mayor of <HI>London,</HI> struck him off his horse, and the atten∣dants of the monarch quickly put him to death.</P>
<P>I CANNOT help indulging myself with the mention of <HI>William Pennant,</HI> an honest goldsmith, my great great great great great great uncle, who, at his house, the <HI>Queen's-head</HI> in <HI>Smithfield,</HI> ac∣quired a considerable fortune in the latter end of the reign of <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and the beginning of that of <HI>James</HI> I. It appears by his will, dated <HI>May</HI> 4th 1607, that he was employed by the court, for numbers of his legacies were to the royal servants. His legacy to Sir <HI>William Fortescue,</HI> knight, his wife's brother, has now a singular appearance:—one chain of gold and pearle, weigh∣ing about 12 ounces and a quarter; one billament of gold and
<PB N="177" REF="195"/>
pearl, being 19 pieces; a round salt of silver and a cover thereto, weighing 15 ounces and somewhat more; six white silver spoons; one feather bed, bolster, two pillows, two blankets, one blue rug; a testearn of satten, figured russet and black, and vallance to the same; 5 curtains of taffety sarcenet; one chair, and a stool with a back of satten figured russet; ten black, and six stools covered with black wrought velvet; and also a great chest covered with black leather, with an in-lock and all things in it, excepting cer∣tain plate hereafter bequeathed. He left to his nephew <HI>Hugh Pennant,</HI> of <HI>Bychton, Flintshire,</HI> the manor of <HI>Moxhall,</HI> in <HI>Essex,</HI> with a considerable estate; but the fruits of the labors of this in∣dustrious tradesman, were all dissipated by a <HI>gentleman</HI> of the family, who fortunately quitted this life before he had wasted our paternal acres. But the charities of <HI>William Pennant,</HI> to the poor of <HI>Whiteford, Flintshire,</HI> are more permanent: for to this day they completely cloath twenty poor people; and in a few years more the trustees of the bequeathed lands flatter themselves with the hopes of doubling the number.</P>
<P>WE now reach a great extent of holy ground, consecrated for the purposes of monastic life, or for the humane purpose of af∣fording relief to our distressed brethren, in their passage through this world. I have not in view a conventual history of <HI>London:</HI> but only mean to give a brief account of those foundations which have a clame to pre-eminence. The church of <HI>St. Bartholomew the Greater</HI> is a small distance from <HI>Smithfield;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHURCH OF ST. BARTHOLOMEW.</NOTE> it is only the choir of the antient building, and the center on which stood the great tower. In the choir are the remains of the old architecture; massy columns, and round arches: part of the cloisters are still preserved in a neighboring stable, and consists of eight arches.
<PB N="178" REF="196"/>
Adjacent is part of the south transept, now converted into a small burying-ground.<NOTE PLACE="marg">PRIORY OF ST. BARTHOLOMEW.</NOTE> This was a conventual church, belonging to a priory of Black Canons, founded in 1102, by one <HI>Rahere,</HI> min∣strel or jester to <HI>Henry</HI> I; who, quitting his profligate life, became the first prior of his own foundation. <HI>Legend</HI> relates, that he had a most horrible dream, out of which he was relieved by <HI>St. Bar∣tholomew</HI> himself, who directed him to found the house, and to dedicate it to him. <HI>Rahere</HI> has here a handsome monument, beneath an arch divided by elegant tabernacle-work. His figure is recumbent, with an angel at his feet, and a canon in a great hood kneeling on each side, as if praying over him. It was after∣wards repaired by <HI>William Bolton,</HI> the last prior. At the dissolu∣tion its revenues, according to <HI>Dugdale,</HI> were £. 653.15<HI>s.</HI> It was granted by <HI>Henry</HI> to Sir <HI>Richard Rich.</HI> Queen <HI>Mary</HI> re-peopled it with Black, or Preaching Friars; but on the accession of <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> they were turned out. <HI>Rich,</HI> who was made lord chancellor in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> VI. made it his place of resi∣dence; as did Sir <HI>Walter Mildmay,</HI> chancellor of the exchequer to queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">ST. BARTHOLOMEW's HOSPITAL.</NOTE>ST. BARTHOLOMEW's hospital will ever be a monument of the piety of <HI>Rahere;</HI> for from him it took its origin. On a waste spot, he obtained a grant of a piece of ground from his master, and built on it an hospital for a master, brethren, and sisters; and for the entertainment of poor diseased people, till they got well; of distressed women big with child, till they were delivered, and were able to go abroad; and for the support of all such children whose mothers died in the house, till they at∣tained the age of seven years. It was given to the neighboring priory, who had the care of it. Its revenues at the dissolution
<PB N="179" REF="197"/>
were £. 305, according to <HI>Dugdale.</HI> The good works of <HI>Rahere</HI> live to this day. The foundation was continued through every reign. The present handsome building, which surrounds a square, was begun in 1729. The extent of the charity is shewn, by saying, that in the last year there were under the care of the hospital three thousand seven hundred and fifty in-patients; and eight thousand one hundred and twenty three out patients.</P>
<P>THE great staircase is admirably painted by <HI>Hogarth,</HI> at his own expence. The subjects are, the good <HI>Samaritan,</HI> and the pool of <HI>Bethesda.</HI> In another part is <HI>Rahere</HI> laying the founda∣tion stone; a sick man carried on a bier attended by monks. The hall is at the head of the staircase, a very large room, orna∣mented with a full-length of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. who had good reason to be complimented, as he presented this house to the citizens. Doctor <HI>Ratcliff</HI> is also here at full-length. He left five hundred pounds a year to this hospital, for the improvement of the diet; and one hundred a year for buying of linen. Happy had it been had all his wealth been so directed, instead of wasting it on that vain <HI>mausoleum,</HI> his library at <HI>Oxford.</HI> The patron saint has over the chimney-piece his portrait, but not in the offensive circum∣stances which <HI>Spagnolet</HI> would have placed it in; for he is cloathed, and has only the knife, the symbol of his martyrdom, in his hand. In the windows is painted <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. delivering the charter to the lord mayor; by him is prince <HI>Arthur,</HI> and two noblemen with white rods.</P>
<P>AT no great distance from this hospital stands (within the walls of the city) that of <HI>Christ-church;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHRIST-CHURCH HOSPITAL,</NOTE> a royal foundation for orphans and poor children, who are taken care of, and apprenticed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ONCE THE GREY FRIARS.</NOTE> at dif∣ferent ages, to proper trades.

The church was reckoned one of the most superb of the conventual: and rose by the contributions of the opulent devout. <HI>Margaret,</HI> daughter of <HI>Philip the Hardy,</HI> and second queen to <HI>Edward</HI> I. in 1306 began the choir. <HI>Isabella,</HI> queen to <HI>Edward</HI> II. gave threescore and ten pounds; and queen <HI>Philippa,</HI> wife of <HI>Edward</HI> III. gave threescore and two pounds, towards the building. <HI>John de Bretagne,</HI> duke of <HI>Richmond,</HI> built the body of the church, at a vast expence: and <HI>Gil∣bert de C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>are,</HI> earl of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> gave twenty great beams out of his forest at <HI>Tunbridge.</HI> No order of monks seem to have the powers of persuasion equal to these poor friars. They raised vast sums for their buildings among the rich: and few of their admirers, when they came to die, who did not console themselves with the thought of lying within their expiating walls; and if they were particularly wicked, thought themselves secure against the assault of the devil, if their corpse was wrapped in the habit and cowl of a friar.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">PERSONAGES INTERRED HERE.</NOTE>MULTITUDES therefore of all ranks were crowded in this holy ground.

<P>AMONG the unfortunate who fell victims to the executioner, in the wretched times of too many of our monarchs, as often un∣justly as otherwise, were the following. I do not reckon, in the list of the first, the ambitious profligate <HI>Roger Mortimer,</HI> para∣mour of <HI>Isabella,</HI> wife to the unhappy <HI>Edward</HI> of <HI>Caernarvon.</HI> He was surprized with the queen in <HI>Nottingham</HI> castle.

<P>SIR <HI>Robert Tresilian,</HI> chief justice of <HI>England;</HI> and Sir <HI>Nicholas
<PB N="182" REF="200"/>
Brembre,</HI> the stout mayor of <HI>London,</HI> suffered the same ignomi∣nous death in the next reign. The first, as a warning to all judges for too great a complaisance to the pleasure of the court; Sir <HI>Nicholas,</HI> for his attachment to his royal master. <HI>Tresilian</HI> fell lamented: especially as the proceedings were hurried in a tumul∣tuary manner, and more indicative of revenge than justice. Su∣perstition records, that when he came to <HI>Tyburn,</HI> he declared that he should not die while he had any thing about him; and that the executioner, on stripping him, found certain images, the head of a devil, and the names of divers others <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See State Trials, vol. 13. old ed.</NOTE>. The charm was broken, and the judge died.</P>
<P>HERE, in 1423, were interred the mangled remains of Sir <HI>John Mortimer,</HI> knight, a victim to the jealousy of the house of <HI>Lan∣caster</HI> against that of <HI>York.</HI> He was put to death on a fictitious charge, by an <HI>ex post facto</HI> law, called the <HI>Statute of Escapes,</HI> made on purpose to destroy him: he was drawn to <HI>Tyburn,</HI> and underwent the rigorous penalty of treason <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Stow</HI>'s <HI>Annals,</HI> 364, 365. <HI>Parliam.

Thus was <HI>Henry</HI> VI. stained with blood even in his infancy, and began a bloody reign with slaughter, continued to the end of his life, by ambition and cruelty not his own.</P>
<P>IN the same ground lies another guiltless sacrifice, <HI>Thomas Bur∣det,</HI> <ABBR>esq</ABBR> ancestor of the present Sir <HI>Robert Burdet.</HI> He had a white buck, which he was particularly fond of; this the king, <HI>Edward</HI> IV. happened to kill. <HI>Burdet,</HI> in anger, wished the horns in the person's body who had advised the king to it.

<P>TO close the list, in 1523, a murdress, a lady <HI>Alice Hungerford,</HI> obtained the favor of lying here.

<P>THE library founded here in 1429,<NOTE PLACE="marg">LIBRARY.</NOTE> by the munificent <HI>Whitting∣ton,</HI> must not be forgotten. It was a hundred and twenty-nine feet long; thirty-one broad: it was cieled with wainscot, had twenty-eight desks, and eight double settles of wainscot. In three years it was filled with books, to the value of five hundred and fifty-six pounds: of which Sir <HI>Richard</HI> contributed four hundred pounds; and Doctor <HI>Thomas Winchelsey,</HI> a friar, supplied the rest. This about thirty years before the invention of printing.</P>
<P>ON the dissolution, this fine church, after being spoiled of its ornaments for the king's use, was made a storehouse for <HI>French</HI> prizes, and the monuments either sold or mutilated. <HI>Henry,</HI> just before his death, touched with remorse, granted the convent and church to the city, and caused the church to be opened for divine service. It was burnt in 1666, and rebuilt by Sir <HI>Christopher Wren,</HI> at a small distance from its former site.

<P>THE buildings belonging to the friars were by <HI>Edward</HI> VI.

applied to this useful charity: that amiable young prince had not any reason to be stimulated to good actions: but it is certain that, after a sermon of exhortation, preached before him by <HI>Ridley,</HI> bishop of <HI>London,</HI> he founded three great hospitals in this city, judiciously adapted to the necessities of the poor, divided into three classes: the hospital of <HI>St. Thomas, Southwark,</HI> for the sick or wounded poor; this for the orphan; and that of <HI>Bridewell</HI> for the thriftless. <HI>Charles</HI> II. founded also here a mathematical school for the instruction of forty boys, and training them up for the sea. Many able mathematicians and seamen have sprung from this institution. In the last year, a hundred and sixty-eight were apprenticed out; of which nine were from the last-mentioned institution. The governors have a seminary to this hospital at <HI>Hertford.</HI> At <HI>London</HI> and at <HI>Hertford</HI> are nine hundred and eighty-two children.</P>
<P>PART of the old buildings and cloister are yet remaining; but the greater part was rebuilt in the last century, under the direction of Sir <HI>Christopher Wren.</HI> The writing school was founded in 1694, by Sir <HI>John Moor,</HI> alderman, who is honored with a statue in front of the building.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">GREAT HALL.</NOTE>IN the great hall is a fine picture of <HI>Charles</HI> II. in his robes, with a great flowing black wig. At a distance is a sea view with shipping: and about him a globe, sphere, telescope, &amp;c. It was painted by <HI>Lely,</HI> in 1662.</P>
<P>HERE is the longest picture I ever saw. King <HI>James</HI> II. amidst his courtiers, receiving the president of this hospital, several of the governors, and numbers of the children, all kneeling; one of the governors with a grey head, and some of the heads of the children, are admirably painted.

<P>THE founder is represented in another picture sitting, and giv∣ing the charter to the governors, who are in their red gowns kneeling; the boys and girls are ranged in two rows; a bishop, possibly <HI>Ridley,</HI> is in the piece. If this was the work of <HI>Holbein,</HI> it has certainly been much injured by repair.</P>
<P>IN the court-room is a three-quarters length of <HI>Edward,</HI> a most beautiful portrait, indisputably by the hand of that great painter. The figure is most richly dressed, with one of his hands upon a dagger.</P>
<P>IN this room are the portraits of two persons of uncommon merit. The first is of Sir <HI>Wolstan Dixie,</HI> lord mayor in 1585. He is repr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nted in a red gown furred, a rich chain, and with a rough beard. The date on his portrait is 1593. He was de∣scended from <HI>Wolstan Dixie,</HI> who was seated at <HI>Catworth,</HI> in <HI>Hun∣tingdonshire,</HI> about the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> III. Sir <HI>Wolstan</HI> was the founder of the family of baronets, settled at <HI>Market-Bosworth,</HI> in <HI>Leicestershire,</HI> which was bestowed by him on his great nephew in the reign of queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Collins's Baronets,</HI> iii. 103.</NOTE>. Sir <HI>Wolstan</HI> was distinguished by the magnificent pageantry of his mayor's day; and by the poetical incense bestowed on the occasion by <HI>George Peele,</HI> A. M. of <HI>Christ-church College, Oxford:</HI> who, among other things, wrote the life of our last prince <HI>Llewelyn,</HI> the loves of king <HI>David</HI> and the fair <HI>Bathsheba,</HI> and the tragedy of <HI>Absalom</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Wood's Athenae Oxon. <HI>i. 300.</HI></NOTE>. But Sir <HI>Wolstan</HI> immortalized himself by his good deeds, and the greatness of his

charities. At <HI>Bosworth</HI> he founded a free-school; every prison in the capital felt his bounty; he portioned poor maidens in mar∣riage; contributed largely to build a pest-house; established two fellowships in <HI>Emanuel College, Cambridge,</HI> and two scholarships; and left to this hospital an annual endowment of forty-two pounds for ever.</P>
<P>BUT a lady, dame <HI>Mary Ramsay,</HI> wife of Sir <HI>Thomas Ramsay,</HI> lord mayor in 1577, greatly surpassed Sir <HI>Wolstan</HI> in her chari∣table deeds. By the gift of twenty pounds a year, to be annually paid to the master and usher of the school belonging to this hos∣pital; and also to the hospital the reversion of a hundred and twenty pounds annually. She was complimented with having her picture placed in this room. She is dressed in a red-bodied gown and petticoat. She augmented fellowships and scholarships; cloathed ten maimed soldiers, at the expence of twenty pounds annually; she did not forget the prisoners in the several gaols; she gave the sum of twelve hundred pounds to five of the compa∣nies, to be lent to young tradesmen for four years; she gave to <HI>Bristol</HI> a thousand pounds, to be laid out in an hospital; she mar∣ried and portioned poor virgins; and, besides other charities I omit, left three thousand pounds to good and pious uses.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">MR. SUTTON's FOUNDATION.</NOTE>THAT gentleman made a most dignified use of his purchase.

Each decayed gentleman has fourteen pounds a year, a gown, meat, fire, and lodgings: and one of them may, if he chuses, attend the manciple to market, to see that he buys good provisions.

<P>THERE is scarcely any vestige of the conventual building, which is said to have stood in the present garden.

<PB N="189" REF="207"/>
he was permitted to return to his own house, under the custody of Sir <HI>Henry Nevil,</HI> the plague at that time raging within the <HI>Tower</HI> liberties. But soon relapsing into his romantic design of a marriage with the unhappy <HI>Mary Stuart,</HI> he was here seized, and conveyed to his former place of confinement. In the great hall are the <HI>Howard</HI> arms, and the date 1571; the very year of his final imprisonment.</P>
<P>HIS grandson, lord <HI>Thomas Howard,</HI> was in possession of this house at the accession of <HI>James</HI> I. This monarch, to shew his respect for a family which had so severely suffered in the cause of his mother, made his first visit, on entering his new capital, on <HI>May</HI> 7th 1604, to this nobleman. His majesty and his train were most splendidly entertained here four whole days <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stow's Annals, <HI>823.</HI></NOTE>; at his depar∣ture, he was as profuse of his honors as he had been at <HI>Theo∣balds</HI> just before, for he dubbed here not fewer than fourscore knights.</P>
<P>IN one of the great apartments is a very good half-length of Mr. <HI>Sutton,</HI> in a black gown furred, and with a white beard.

The whole order had, in different parts of <HI>Christendom,</HI> nineteen thousand manors. In 1323, the revenues of the <HI>English</HI> knights templars were bestowed on them. This gave them such importance, that the prior was ranked as first baron of <HI>England,</HI> and lived in the highest state.

<P>SIR <HI>Thomas Chaloner,</HI> tutor to prince <HI>Henry,</HI> built a fine house in the close of the priory, and on it inscribed these apt verses,

<P>THE church was made parochial. Part of the cloisters re∣main, at lest till very lately, as did part of the nun's hall.

In 1391, they performed before the king and queen, and whole court, three days successively.

<P><PB N="196" REF="216"/>CLOSE to <HI>Clerkenwell-green</HI> stands <HI>Albemarle,</HI> or <HI>Newcastle-house;</HI> the property and residence of the mad dutchess, and widow of the second duke of <HI>Albemarle,</HI> and last surviving daughter and coheiress of <HI>Cavendish</HI> duke of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> who died here in 1734.

<P>OPPOSITE to this house is another, very large, ascended to by a long flight of steps. It is now divided into three houses. It is called <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI>'s; and tradition says, it was his place of conference with <HI>Ireton, Bradshaw,</HI> and others. If it had been his residence, it probably was usurped from some of the loyalists, and made his mansion, before he attained his fullness of power, and lived in regal state at <HI>Whitehall.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">NEW RIVER HEAD.</NOTE>In the fields, at a small distance from <HI>Clerkenwell,</HI> is the <HI>New River Head,</HI> the great repository which supplies the largest por∣tion of our capital with water. To give a greater extent of service, of late years another reservoir has been made on the heights, at a little distance to the north of the former. This is supplied with water from the first by means of an engine, which is worked by horses, forcing the water up the ascent; from hence it streams down to places which the other had not the power of benefiting. These reservoirs may be called the HEART of the work. The element, essentially useful as the vital fluid, at first rushes through veins of vast diameter; divides into lesser; and
<PB N="197" REF="217"/>
again into thousands of ramifications, which support the life of this most populous city.</P>
<P>NO one ought to be ignorant that this unspeakable benefit is owing to a WELSHMAN! Sir HUGH MIDDELTON, of <HI>Denbigh;</HI> who, on <HI>September</HI> 20th, 1608, began, and on <HI>September</HI> 29th, 1613, completed the great work. He brought the water from <HI>Amwell,</HI> in <HI>Hertfordshire,</HI> a distance of twenty, but, from the ne∣cessity of making a <HI>detour</HI> to avoid hills and vallies, it was increas∣ed to thirty-eight miles three-quarters and sixteen poles. Yet it was impossible to escape difficulties. His daring spirit penetrated the hills in several places: and carried the river over two vallies. Over one it extended six hundred and sixty feet in length, and thirty in height; and over another, four hundred and sixty-two feet in length. The original source of this river was, by the vast increase of <HI>London,</HI> found inadequate to its wants. The New River company found it necessary to have recourse to another supply. They applied to parlement for powers to obtain it from the river <HI>Lee,</HI> the property of the city. <HI>London</HI> opposed the bene∣fit intended its inhabitants; but in vain, parlement wisely deter∣mined against their objections: so the blessing was forced upon them! and the river <HI>Lee</HI> supplies the greater part of the wants of the city. Sir HUGH MIDDELTON was ruined by the execution of his project. So little was the benefit understood, that, for above thirty years, the seventy-two shares, it was divided into, shared only five pounds apiece. Each of these shares was sold originally for a hundred pounds. Within this twelvemonth they were sold at nine thousand pounds a share; and lately at ten thou∣sand: and are increasing, because their profits increase, on which their dividends are grounded. Half of the seventy-two shares
<PB N="198" REF="218"/>
are called king's shares, and are in less estimation than the others, because subject to a grant of five hundred pounds a year, made so long ago as the reign of <HI>James</HI> I. when the water was first brought to <HI>London,</HI> or soon after.</P>
<P>I NOW descend to the <HI>Temple,</HI> and resume my journey along <HI>Fleet-street,</HI> as far as the southern extremity of the walls of <HI>London,</HI> the antient precinct; to follow them to their opposite end near the <HI>Tower;</HI> to describe their neighboring suburbs, and the parts of the city bordering on their interior sides. These, with the city itself, shall form the final consideration, together with the suburbs which point to <HI>Blackwall,</HI> and form a street of amazing extent.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">ST. DUNSTAN'S CHURCH.</NOTE>JUST beyond the entrance into <HI>Chancery-lane,</HI> is <HI>St. Dunstan</HI>'s church.

It was when thus employed at his forge, that he seized the devil by the nose with the red-hot tongs, till he roared again. The daemon had visited him in a female form, and suffered for intruding on this woman-hating saint.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="219"/>HIS church is probably of very antient foundation: yet the first mention of it is in 1237, when the abbot and convent of <HI>Westminster</HI> bestowed it on <HI>Henry</HI> III; who bestowed the profits on the <HI>Domus Conversorum,</HI> or the house for converted Jews.

And <HI>Henry</HI> I. gave as many of the stones, from the walls of the castle-yard, as served to inclose and form the gates, and precinct of the church. Notwithstanding this, the dwelling remained, and became the residence of several of our monarchs <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stow's Survaie, <HI>116.</HI> Dugdale's St. Paul's, <HI>6.</HI></NOTE>.

From the <HI>Cistercians,</HI> who would not own his supremacy, not less than thirty-three thousand. <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. rebuilt the palace, in a most magnificent manner, for the reception of the emperor <HI>Charles</HI> V. who visited <HI>England</HI> in 1522. After all the expence, the emperor lodged in <HI>Black Friars,</HI> and his suite in the new palace; and a gallery of communication was flung over the ditch, and a passage cut through the city wall

into the emperor's apartments. The king often lodged here, particularly in 1529, when the question of his marriage with queen <HI>Catherine</HI> was agitated at <HI>Black Friars.</HI> It fell afterwards into decay, and was begged by the pious prelate <HI>Ridley,</HI> from <HI>Edward</HI> VI. to be converted to some charitable purpose.<NOTE PLACE="marg">HOUSE OF CORRECTION.</NOTE> That of a house of correction was determined on, for vagabonds of each sex and all denominations. The first time I visited the place, there was not a single male prisoner, and about twenty female. They were confined on a ground-floor, and employed in beating of hemp. When the door was opened, by the keeper, they ran towards it like so many hounds in kennel; and presented a most moving sight: about twenty young creatures, the eldest not ex∣ceeding sixteen, many of them with angelic faces, divested of every angelic passion; and featured with impudence, impenitency, and profligacy; and cloathed in the silken tatters of squalid finery. A magisterial! a national opprobrium!!!—What a disad∣vantageous contrast to the <HI>Spinhuis,</HI> in <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> where the con∣fined sit under the eye of a matron spinning or sewing, in plain and neat dresses, provided by the public. No trace of their former lives appears in their countenances; a thorough reformation seems to have been effected, equally to the emolument and honor of the republic. This is also the place of confinement for dis∣obedient and idle apprentices. They are kept separate, in airy cells; and have an allotted task to be performed in a certain time. They, the men and women, are employed in beating hemp, pick∣ing oakum, and packing of goods, and are said to earn their maintenance.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>Bridewell</HI> is not only a prison for the dissolute,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A HOUSE OF INDUSTRY.</NOTE> but a hos∣pital
<PB N="204" REF="224"/>
for the education of the industrious youth. Here twenty Arts masters (as they are styled) consisting of decayed tradesmen, such as shoemakers, taylors, flax-dressers, and weavers, have houses, and receive apprentices, who are instructed in several trades; the masters receiving the profit of their labors. After the boys have served their time with credit, they are payed ten pounds to begin the world with; and are entitled to the freedom of the city. They are dressed in blue, with a white hat. The procession of these, and the children of <HI>Christ's Hospital,</HI> on <HI>Easter Monday</HI> and <HI>Tuesday,</HI> to <HI>St. Bride</HI>'s church, affords to the humane the most pleasing spectacle, as it excites the reflection of the mul∣titudes thus rescued from want, profligacy, and perdition. The number of vagrants, and other indigent and miserable people, received into this house the last year, was seven hundred and six∣teen; many of whom had physic, and other relief, as their neces∣sities required, at the expence of the hospital.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">COURT OF JUSTICE.</NOTE>SOME of the original building yet remains; as does the magni∣ficent flight of antient stairs, which leads to the present court of justice, which is a handsome apartment.

<P>THE creek, called <HI>Fleet-ditch,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">FLEET-DITCH.</NOTE> had its entrance from the <HI>Thames</HI> immediately below <HI>Bridewell;</HI> and reached as far as <HI>Holborn-bridge,</HI> at the foot of <HI>Holborn-hill;</HI> and received into it the little river <HI>Fleet, Turnmill</HI> brook, and another called <HI>Oldbourn,</HI> which gave name to that vast street. The tide flowed up as high as <HI>Holborn-bridge,</HI> and brought up barges of considerable burden. Over it were four stone bridges, and on the sides extensive quays and warehouses. It was of such utility, that it was scoured and kept open at vast expence; and, not later than 1606, near twenty-eight thousand pounds were expended for that purpose.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="226"/>IN the performing of this work, at the depth of fifteen feet, were found several <HI>Roman</HI> utensils; and a little deeper, a great quan∣tity of <HI>Roman</HI> coins, in silver, copper, brass, and other metals, but none in gold. At <HI>Holborn-bridge</HI> were found two brazen <HI>Lares,</HI> about four inches long; one a <HI>Bacchus,</HI> the other a <HI>Ceres.</HI> It is a probable conjecture that these were thrown in by the affrighted <HI>Romans,</HI> at the approach of the enraged <HI>Boadicia,</HI> who soon took ample revenge on her insulting conquerors. Here were also found numbers of <HI>Saxon</HI> antiquities, spurs, weapons, keys, seals, &amp;c.; also medals, crosses, and crucifixes, which might likewise have been flung in on occasion of some alarm.</P>
<P>THIS canal was afterwards neglected, and became a nusance; was filled up, and a sewer formed beneath to convey the water to the river. The fine market, which extends the whole length of the old ditch, rose in its place in 1733; in which year an act was passed to empower the lord mayor and citizens to fill up the ditch at their own expence, and to vest the see-simple of the ground in them and their successors for ever. I recollect the present noble approach to <HI>Blackfriars-bridge,</HI> the well-built open∣ing of CHATHAM-PLACE, a muddy and genuine ditch. This had been the mouth of the creek, which, as <HI>Stow</HI> informs us, in 1307 was of depth and width sufficient

A dirty fellow invited you in.

<P>I SHALL now give a general view of the <HI>Walls,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CITY WALLS.</NOTE> the antient de∣fence of the city; and of the <HI>Town-ditch,</HI> a work of considerable labor. In my progress I shall point out whatsoever was remark∣able in the adjacent suburbs, or the parts within the city which border on the walls. There never was any alteration made in the course of this first precinct, which was preserved through all succeeding ages; and in every reparation or additional strength which was thought necessary. Its direction was from the first irregular. The <HI>Romans,</HI> as was frequently the case, consulted the necessity of the ground <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vegetius.</NOTE>. It commenced at the <HI>Palatine-tower,</HI> ran in a strait line along the eminence of <HI>Ludgate-hill,</HI> and above <HI>Fleet-ditch,</HI> as far as <HI>Newgate;</HI> then suddenly was carried north∣erly to a spot a little beyond <HI>Aldersgate,</HI> and at that place ran strait in a northern direction almost to <HI>Cripplegate;</HI> from whence it resumed a strait eastern course as far as <HI>Bishopsgate,</HI> in which a long remnant of the wall, still called <HI>London Wall,</HI> is to be seen. From <HI>Bishopsgate</HI> it assumes a gentle curvature pointed to the <HI>Tower,</HI> over the site of which it originally passed, and pro∣bably finished in a <HI>Castellum</HI> in this, as it did in the western extre∣mity. Another wall guarded the river, and ran the whole length
<PB N="210" REF="230"/>
of the south side of the city, on the direction of the vast street called <HI>Thames-street.</HI> But all this I shall particularize in my walk round the antient walls.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">TOWN-DITCH.</NOTE>I SHALL first mention another considerable addition to the strength of those fortifications. The <HI>Town-ditch</HI> was a stupendous piece of work, began in the reign of king <HI>John,</HI> in 1211, by the <HI>Londoners</HI> themselves, possibly as a protection against their own monarch; who, in resentment to them, had just removed the Ex∣chequer to <HI>Northampton.</HI> It was two hundred feet broad, and extended, on the outside of the walls, from <HI>Tower-ditch</HI> quite to <HI>Christ's Hospital.</HI> Notwithstanding the multitude of hands em∣ployed, it was not finished in less than two years. It was filled with water, as is evident from the quantity of good fish <HI>Stow</HI> in∣forms us was taken in it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Survaie,</HI> i. p. 47.</NOTE>. The citizens for some centuries were at great expence in cleansing and keeping it open: but, after the last attempt, in 1595, the work was given over, it became stable land, and was soon covered with buildings.</P>
<P>THE western wall terminated near the river with a sort, which I apprehend to have been the castle of <HI>Montfitchet,</HI> soon to be mentioned.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">BLACK FRIARS.</NOTE>WITHIN the walls, opposite to <HI>Bridewell,</HI> stood the great house of <HI>Black Friars,</HI> or <HI>Dominicans;</HI> founded by the interest and ex∣hortations of <HI>Robert Kilwarby,</HI> archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> about 1276; when <HI>Gregory Rocksley,</HI> and the barons of <HI>London,</HI> pre∣sented him with the ground. <HI>Edward</HI> I. and his queen <HI>Elianor</HI> became great benefactors; by the assistance of whom, the arch∣bishop built the monastery, and a large church richly ornamented.
<PB N="211" REF="231"/>
This obtained every immunity which any religious house had. Its precinct was very large, had four gates, and contained numbers of shops; the inhabitants of which were subject only to the king, the superior of the house, and their own justices. It also became a sanctuary for debtors, and even malefactors; a privilege which it preserved even long after the suppression of religious houses.</P>
<P>To make way for this foundation, two lanes were pulled down, and part of the city wall; which last was rebuilt immediately by a charter granted by <HI>Edward</HI> I. for that purpose.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CASTLE OF MONTFICHET.</NOTE> The castle of <HI>Montfichet</HI> also fell a sacrifice to this house. It was built by <HI>Gil∣bert de Montfichet,</HI> a follower of the Conqueror: and, growing ruinous, by gift of the king the materials were used for the build∣ing of the church, on the site of this antient tower. The church became a fashionable place of interment of people of rank; and to be buried in the habit of the order, was thought to be a sure pre∣servative against the attacks of the devil. Among other illustri∣ous personages was <HI>Hubert de Burgh,</HI> earl of <HI>Kent,</HI> and his wife <HI>Margaret,</HI> sister to <HI>Alexander</HI> II. king of <HI>Scotland;</HI> the heart of queen <HI>Elianor;</HI> lord <HI>Fanhope;</HI> that patron of learning <HI>John Tip∣toft,</HI> earl of <HI>Worcester,</HI> beheaded in 1470; <HI>James Touchet,</HI> earl of <HI>Audley,</HI> beheaded in 1497; Sir <HI>Thomas Brandon,</HI> knight of the Garter; <HI>William Courteney,</HI> earl of <HI>Devonshire;</HI> and much other great and noble dust.</P>
<P>IN the same church were also held several parlements. The remarkable one of 1450, in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VI. was adjourned from <HI>Westminster</HI> to this place; here the weak monarch vainly endeavoured to divert the storm raised by his subjects against the favorite of his queen, <HI>William de la Pole,</HI> duke of <HI>Suffolk;</HI> and by a poor expedient, a simulated <HI>exile,</HI> drove him to instant death.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="232"/>HERE, in 1524, <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. held another, in order to oppress his subjects with an aid of eight hundred thousand pounds, to carry on his imprudent wars. The virtue of the commons resisted the demand, and gave him ony a moderate tax. This was called the <HI>Black</HI> parlement, as it began amongst the <HI>Black Monks,</HI> at <HI>Westminster;</HI> and ended among the <HI>Black Friars.</HI></P>
<P>HERE cardinal <HI>Campeggio,</HI> and cardinal <HI>Wolsey,</HI> sat, in 1529, as judges and legates, on the question of divorce between <HI>Henry</HI> and the ill-fated princess <HI>Catherine</HI> of <HI>Arragon; Henry</HI> and his queen at that time residing in the palace of <HI>Bridewell,</HI> ready to attend the farcical citations of that court. And in this place <HI>Wolsey</HI> him∣self fell from all his greatness; for here began the parlement which gave the sentence of <HI>premunire,</HI> the last stroke to all his prospe∣rity.</P>
<P>WITH all the great events which honored this house, its reve∣nues, at the dissolution, were only one hundred pounds fifteen shillings and five pence. Bishop <HI>Fisher</HI> held it <HI>in commendam;</HI> and in 1538, with fifteen brethren, surrendered it to the king. <HI>Edward</HI> VI. afterwards granted it to Sir <HI>Thomas Cawarden.</HI></P>
<P>IN the reign of queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> the <HI>Black Friars</HI> became a place much inhabited by people of fashion. Among others, lord <HI>Herbert,</HI> son of <HI>William,</HI> fourth earl of <HI>Worcester,</HI> had a house here, which queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> in 1600, honored with her presence, on occasion of his nuptials with the daughter and heiress of <HI>John</HI> lord <HI>Russel,</HI> son of <HI>Francis</HI> earl of <HI>Bedford.</HI> The queen was met at the water-side by the bride, and carried to her house in a <HI>lectica</HI> by six knights; her majesty dined there, and supped in the same neighborhood, with lord <HI>Cobham;</HI> where there was
<Q>a memora∣ble maske of 8 ladies, and a straunge dawnce new invented.
<PB N="213" REF="233"/>
Their attire is this: each hath a skirt of cloth of silver; a rich wastcoat wrought with silkes, and gold and silver; a mantell of carnacion taffete, cast under the arme; and there haire loose about there shoulders, curiously knotted and interlaced. Mrs. <HI>Fitton</HI> leade; these 8 ladys maskets choose 8 ladies more to dawnce the measures. Mrs. <HI>Fitton</HI> went to the queen, and woed her dawnce: her majesty (the love of <HI>Essex</HI> rankling in her breast) asked what she was? <HI>Affection,</HI> she said: <HI>Affection!</HI> said the queen, <HI>Affection</HI> is false. Yet her majestie rose up and dawnced <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sydney Papers,</HI> ii. 203.</NOTE>.</Q>
At this time the queen was sixty: surely, as Mr. WALPOLE observed, it was at that period as natural for her to be in love!—I must not forget, that in her passage from the bride's to lord <HI>Cobham</HI>'s, she went through the house of Doctor <HI>Puddin,</HI> and was presented by the doctor with a fan.—The <HI>Count de Tillier,</HI> ambassador of <HI>France,</HI> in the latter end of the reign of <HI>James</HI> I. resided here. During his residence in <HI>England,</HI> the dreadful acci∣dent, called the <HI>Fatal Vespers,</HI> happened near his house. A cele∣brated preacher of the order of the Jesuits, father <HI>Drury,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">FATAL VESPERS.</NOTE> gave a sermon to a large audience of <HI>British</HI> subjects, in a spacious room up three pair of stairs. In the midst of the discourse the floor fell, and ninety-four persons, besides the preacher, perished. It is disgusting to reflect on the uncharitable bigotry of the times. The <HI>Protestants</HI> considered the accident as a judgment on the <HI>Catholics,</HI> for their idolatry: the <HI>Catholics</HI> attributed it to a plot of the <HI>Protestants,</HI> to bring destruction on their dissenting bre∣thren.</P>

handsome building, in which medicines of all kinds are prepared, and sold at a cheap rate: here also are made up the chests of medicines for the army and navy. It was finished in 1670: but I am not acquainted with the time of the first establishment of this useful institution: perhaps in that of <HI>James</HI> I. there being in the hall the portrait of that monarch, and a bust of his apothe∣cary, <HI>Gideon Dilaune.</HI></P>

It was in my memory a wretched prison for debtors; it commenced what was called a free-prison, in 1373, but soon lost that privilege. It was enlarged,
<PB N="215" REF="235"/>
and had the addition of a chapel, by Sir <HI>Stephen Forster,</HI> on a very romantic occasion. He himself had been confined there, and, begging at the grate, was accosted by a rich widow, who asked him what sum would purchase his liberty. She payed it down, took him into her service, and afterward married him. In the chapel was an inscription in honor of him and <HI>Agnes</HI> his wife, dated 1454, the year in which he enjoyed the honor of being lord mayor of the city.</P>
<P>THIS gate gave a conclusion to the rebellion of Sir <HI>Thomas Wyat.</HI> When he had, with some loss, led his forces along the <HI>Strand</HI> and <HI>Fleet-street,</HI> in hopes of being joined by the citizens, he found it shut against him, and strongly manned; seized with de∣spondency, he retreated a little down the hill, and, flinging himself on a bench opposite to the inn called <HI>The Bell Savage,</HI> began to re∣pent the rashness of his enterprize and lament his folly.

Every precaution has been taken to keep the court airy, and to prevent the effect of the effluvia arising from that dreadful dis∣order the gaol-fever. The havoke it made in <HI>May,</HI> 1750, was a melancholy admonition to those interested in every court of jus∣tice. My respected kinsman Sir <HI>Samuel Pennant,</HI> lord mayor; baron <HI>Clark;</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Abney,</HI> judge of the common pleas; the under sheriff, some of the counsel, and several of the jury, and of other persons, died of this putrid distemper. Several of these fatal accidents have happened in this kingdom, which makes the sur∣prize the greater, that the neglect of the salutary precautions was continued till the time of this awakening call.—MR. HOWARD has given us a view and plan of the great gaol of <HI>Newgate,</HI> as now rebuilt. Some of the defects of the old one are remedied: but this FRIEND TO MANKIND seems still to think it is not free from errors; and that, without great care, the prisoners are yet liable to the fatal fever, the result of one of those errors<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">State of Prisons, 4to edition, 213.</NOTE>.</P>

of the lives forfeited to the justice of their country, several years before the fatal tree was removed from <HI>Tyburn</HI> to its present site. It is a handsome building, ornamented with <HI>ionic</HI> pilasters; and with a double flight of steps to the first floor. Beneath them is a door for the admission of the bodies of murderers, and other felons; who, noxious in their lives, make a sort of reparation to their fellow-creatures, by becoming useful after death.</P>
<P>THE new prison, which retains the name of <HI>Newgate,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">NEWGATE;</NOTE> from the gate which, till within these few years, formed a part of it, is immediately beyond the Sessions-house: a massy building, with an extensive front of rustic-work, with all the appearance of strength and security. Yet, in the infamous riots of 1780, the felons confined even in the strongest holds were released; stones of two or three tons in weight, to which the doors of their cells were fastened, were raised by that resistless species of crow, well-known to housebreakers by the name of the <HI>Pig's-foot.</HI> Such was the violence of the fire, that the great iron bars of the win∣dows were eaten through; and the adjacent stones vitrified.</P>
<P>THE gate stood a little beyond this building:<NOTE PLACE="marg">WHEN BUILT.</NOTE> as a military way has been traced under it, there can be no doubt but there had been one during the time the city was possessed by the <HI>Romans:</HI> but the place had been made up, and no vestiges of it left. The gate, which supplied its place, is supposed by <HI>Stow</HI> to have been erected between the years 1108 and 1128, when <HI>Richard Beau∣veyes,</HI> bishop of <HI>London,</HI> by enlarging the precincts of <HI>St. Paul</HI>'s, had obstructed the usual way under <HI>Ludgate,</HI> and made this new outlet necessary. Mr. <HI>Howel</HI> says, that the original name was <HI>Chamberlain-gate.</HI> It had been for ages a prison, even as long as
<PB N="218" REF="240"/>
the year 1218; and for persons of rank, long before the <HI>Tower</HI> was used for that purpose. <HI>Robert Baldock,</HI> chancellor to <HI>Edward</HI> III. was sent there; where, says <HI>Fabian,</HI> he ended his days misera∣bly <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chr. vol. ii. part vii. 285.</NOTE>: Sir <HI>Thomas Percie,</HI> lord <HI>Egremond,</HI> and other people of distinction, were committed to that prison in 1457. In 1412, this gate was rebuilt by the executors of the famous Sir <HI>Richard Whittington,</HI> out of the effects he had allotted for works of cha∣rity: his statue, with the cat, remained in a nich to its final demolition, on the rebuilding of the present prison. It was de∣stroyed in the fire of 1666, and rebuilt in its late form. It had one great arch, and one postern for passengers: and on each side a half hexagon tower.</P>

He inveighs with great indigna∣tion at the increase of that species of fuel; and at the introduction of so many manufactories, productive of smoke, which not only deformed our noblest buildings with the sooty tinge, but also, from the quantity of coal, brought on catarrhs, coughs, and con∣sumptions, in a degree unknown in <HI>Paris,</HI> and other cities, who make use of wood only.

But by the year 1745, it having been discovered, that the above arts were foreign to, and independent of each other, the barbers and the surgeons were, by act of parlement, sepa∣rated, and made distinct corporations. It was very fit that an asso∣ciation, which was now become ludicrous, should be dissolved: our surgeons began at that period to rise into great fame.

<P>IT will be curious to turn back from these times to those of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. to compare the state of surgery: when at one time there were very few, as <HI>Gale</HI> tells us, worthy to be called surgeons. His account of those employed in the army is very humorous. "I remember," says he,
<Q>when I was in the wars at <HI>Muttrel (Montreuil)</HI> in the time of that most famous prince king <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. there was a great rabblement, that took on them to be surgeons: some were sow-gelders, and some horse-gelders, with tinkers, and coblers. This noble sect did such great cures, that they got themselves a perpetual name; for, like as <HI>Thessalus</HI>'s sect were called <HI>Thessalions,</HI> so was this noble rabblement, for their notorious cures, called <HI>Dog-leaches;</HI> for in two dressings they did commonly make their cures whole and found for ever; so that they neither felt heat nor cold, nor no manner of pain after. But when the duke of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> who was then general, understood how the people did die, and that of small wounds, he sent for me, and certain other surgeons, commanding us to make search how these men came to their death; whether it were by the grievousness of their wounds, or by the lack of knowledge of the surgeons; and we, according
<PB N="230" REF="255"/>
to our commandment, made search through all the camp; and found many of the same good fellows, which took upon them the names of surgeons; not only the names, but the wages also. We asking of them whether they were surgeons or no, they said they were; we demanded with whom they were brought up, and they, with shameless faces, would answer, either with one cunning man, or another, which was dead. Then we de∣manded of them what chirurgery stuff they had to cure men withal; and they would shew us a pot, or a box, which they had in a budget; wherein was such trumpery as they did use to grease horses heels withal, and laid upon scabbed horses backs, with rewal, and such like. And others, that were cob∣lers and tinkers, they used shoe-maker's wax, with the rust of old pans, and made therewithal a noble salve, as they did term it. But in the end, this worthy rabblement was committed to the <HI>Marshalsea,</HI> and threatened, by the duke's grace, to be hanged for their worthy deeds, except they would declare the truth what they were, and of what occupations; and in the end they did confess, as I have declared to you before <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Atkin</HI>'s Memoirs of Medicine, p. 99.</NOTE>.</Q>

At first (the medical relief excepted) their expences were borne by their friends, or their parishes; but this edifice being found too small, and growing ruinous, in 1675 the lord mayor and aldermen, remov∣ing the site to the present place, began the noble hospital we now see; and, great as it is, finished it in the next year, at the expence of seventeen thousand pounds.

<P>ON the west side of <HI>Moorfields</HI> is the <HI>Artillery Ground:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ARTILLERY GROUND.</NOTE> a large piece of ground laid out for the purpose of proving the artillery; and for exercising the military belonging to the city. It was ori∣ginally in <HI>Bishopsgate-street,</HI> where some land belonging to the priory of <HI>St. Mary Spittle</HI> was used for the same purpose. <HI>Wil∣liam,</HI> last prior of this house, granted it, for three ninety-nine years, to the fraternity of artillery, or the gunners of the <HI>Tower,</HI> for the practice of great and small ordnance; and was long called the <HI>Artillery Garden.</HI> This society was greatly patronised by <HI>Henry</HI> VIII: his daughter <HI>Elizabeth</HI> favored it in a high degree; as became a princess whose dominions were threatened with per∣petual invasion from her potent rival.

<P><PB N="238" REF="263"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">ARTILLERY COMPANY.</NOTE>IN 1585 a new military society arose in the city; which, in those affrighted times, finding itself grievously harrassed by continual musters and exercising of men, found a remedy in the gallant spirit of several of the citizens. A number (among whom were many skilful officers, who had served with credit abroad) formed themselves into a respectable body of volunteers, exercised them∣selves, and trained others to the art of war. Within two years there were near three hundred merchants, and others, capable of training and teaching soldiers the management of their pieces, pikes, and halbards; to march, counter-march, and ring. They made a considerable figure at the camp at <HI>Tilbury,</HI> in the cele∣brated year 1588. After that time, this useful discipline was neglected; but in 1610 it revived, and the volunteers became so numerous as to amount in time to six thousand men. The old place of exercise being too small for the purpose, they removed to the <HI>New Artillery Ground.</HI> In the year 1614, there was a gene∣ral muster; and the citizens, bravely furnished, under twenty cap∣tains, made a most creditable appearance. In 1622 they began to build on one side an armoury, which is excellently supplied. <HI>Charles</HI> II. when prince, and his brother <HI>James</HI> duke of <HI>York,</HI> entered into this company: and on the Restoration the duke him∣self took the command, and called it his own company. The president, and other officers, consist of the leading persons in the city: and one of the royal family is captain-general. It consists of three hundred men.</P>
<P>BESIDES this military force, the city has six regiments of militia, commanded by gentlemen of the first rank in the city: these are under a lieutenancy peculiar to <HI>London;</HI> and are exercised.</P>
<P>IT was this body, then known by the name of the <HI>Trained-bands,</HI>
<PB N="239" REF="264"/>
which decided the fate of the civil war of the last century. On every occasion they behaved with the spirit and perseverance of the most veteran troops. They were commanded by <HI>Skippon,</HI> captain of the <HI>Artillery Garden,</HI> who had served long in <HI>Holland;</HI> and raised himself from a common soldier to the rank of captain, and proved himself an excellent officer. From the service he had been in, he came over with full prejudice against church and state, so was greatly in the confidence of his party <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Clarendon,</HI> ii. 380.</NOTE>. He was totally illiterate; but his speeches to his soldiers had more weight in their ears than the finest oratory. On marching to join the earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> this was his speech:

In memory of the founder, and the first repairer, there were two statues of bishops: and besides, two others, conjectured to have been designed for <HI>Alfred,</HI> and <HI>Aeldred</HI> earl of <HI>Mercia,</HI> to whose care that great prince had committed the gate.</P>

In the year 1189, <HI>Richard</HI> I. ordered that they should be built with stone to a certain height, and that they should be covered with slate or burnt tile. This order was re∣peated, but it was long before it was obeyed. This is not much to be wondered at; for, above a century afterwards, such simpli∣city reigned, that one <HI>Peter Spileman</HI> made fine for his lands to <HI>Edward</HI> II. to find (among other things) <HI>litter</HI> for the king's bed, and hay for his horse <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Blunt</HI>'s Jocular Tenures, 123, last edition.</NOTE>.</P>

By the marriage of his daughter and sole heiress <HI>Margaret,</HI> to <HI>Thomas</HI> duke of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> it was conveyed into the <HI>Howard</HI> family; and received the name of <HI>Duke's Place.</HI> In 1562, he rode through the city with his dutchess, to his residence here, attended by a hundred horse in his livery, with his gentlemen before him in coats guarded with velvet, preceded by the four heralds, <HI>Claren∣cieux, Somerset, Red Cross,</HI> and <HI>Blue Mantle.</HI> So respectable was the appearance of our ancient nobility.</P>
<P>TWO gateways, and some parts of the ruins of this priory, may be still traced, enveloped in more modern buildings: some of the south transept may be discovered in certain houses; from which it appears that the architecture was of the round arch, or <HI>Saxon</HI> style <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Carter</HI> has made drawings of these remains.</NOTE>.</P>

riotous people, attacked the city on this side, won this gate, and forced a way in for a few of his forces; but, the portcullis being let down, they were all slain. The valiant alderman of the ward, and the recorder, ordered it to be drawn up, and sallying forth, defeated the Bastard with great slaughter.

Different princes added other works. The present contents, within the walls, are twelve acres and five rods; the circuit, on the outside of the ditch, one thousand and fifty-two feet. It was again inclosed with a mud-wall by <HI>Henry</HI> III: this was placed at a distance from the ditch, and occasioned the taking down of part of the city wall; which was resented by the citizens; who, pulling down this precinct of mud, were punished by the king with a fine of a thousand marks.</P>

<Q><HI>Talbot Edwards,</HI> late keeper of his majesty's <HI>regalia,</HI> 30th <HI>September,</HI> 1674, aged 80,</Q>
was de∣posited here. Was it not a shameless reign, no remembrance of this good and faithful servant would have been suffered to remain. This venerable man was keeper of the <HI>regalia,</HI> when the russian <HI>Blood</HI> made the notorious attempt on the crown, and other orna∣ments of majesty. Never was a more determined villain:
<Q>with a head to contrive, and heart to execute any wickedness.</Q>
<HI>Blood</HI> contrived, under the guise of a clergyman, to make acquaint∣ance with Mr. <HI>Edwards;</HI> insinuated himself into his favor and confidence. After various visits, with the assistance of several other associates, he seized on the old man, whom he had requested to shew the jewels to his friends, gagged him, and on his resisting, struck him on the head with a mallet, and gave him several stabs. <HI>Edwards</HI> thought it prudent to counterfeit death. <HI>Blood</HI> put the crown under his parson's gown: another put the globe in his breeches: a third, not being able to conceal the sceptre by reason of its length, broke off the rich ruby and put it in his pocket. As soon as they were gone, <HI>Edwards</HI> forced out the gag, and gave the alarm; they were instantly pursued, and three of them
<PB N="267" REF="292"/>
soon taken. <HI>Blood</HI> struggled hard for his prize, saying, when it was wrested from him, <HI>It was a gallant attempt, though unsuccess∣ful; it was for a</HI> CROWN.</P>
<P>THE curiosity of the king was excited to see a man engaged in so many important villanies: under pretence of obtaining discove∣ries, his majesty made the wretch a visit; from that moment the artful <HI>Blood</HI> dated his security: he told the king so many plausible tales; such indifference he shewed for his own life, such anxiety for that of his majesty (for he insinuated that his comrades would certainly revenge his death, even on his sacred majesty) that in a short time he obtained his pardon. It was necessary to apply to the duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> for permission, the ruffian having made the attempt on his grace's life not long before. The duke nobly an∣swered,
<Q>If his majesty could forgive him stealing the crown, he might easily forgive the attempt upon his life; and if such was his majesty's pleasure, that was a sufficient reason for him, and his lordship (the earl of <HI>Arlington,</HI> who brought the message) might spare the rest.</Q>
<HI>Blood</HI> was not only pardoned, but re∣ceived into favor, had a pension of five hundred a year, and was perpetually seen at court, enjoying the smiles of majesty, and even successfully employing his interest, as a most respectable patron. But all good men looked on him with horror, and con∣sidered him as a <HI>Sicarius</HI> to a profligate set of men, to overawe any who had integrity enough to resist the measures of a most profligate court. This miscreant died peacefully in his bed, <HI>Au∣gust</HI> 29th, 1680, fearlessly, and without any signs of penitence; totally hardened and forsaken by Heaven.</P>
<P>THE innocent <HI>Talbot Edwards,</HI> so far from receiving the grate∣ful reward of his fidelity and sufferings, got with great difficulty

a pension of two hundred a year; and his son, who was active in taking <HI>Blood,</HI> one hundred more: but the order for the pensions was so long delayed, and the expences attending the cure of the good old man's wounds so great, that he was forced to sell his order for a hundred pounds ready money, and the son his for fifty.

The conspiracy in 1603, for which lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh,</HI> and others, were condemned, was supposed, among other objects, to have that of placing the crown on the head of this unfortunate lady; on which she was confined to her own house. She found means to be married privately to Sir <HI>William Seymour,</HI> second son of the earl of <HI>Hertford,</HI> after∣wards restored to the dukedom of <HI>Somerset.</HI> On discovery of the wedding, they were committed to the <HI>Tower,</HI> to the care of diffe∣rent keepers.

<P>A LITTLE to the south of <HI>East Smithfield,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ST. CATHERINE'S HOSPITAL.</NOTE> is the hospital of <HI>St. Catherine</HI>'s, originally founded in 1148, by <HI>Matilda</HI> of <HI>Boulogne,</HI> wife of king <HI>Stephen,</HI> for the repose of her son <HI>Bald∣win,</HI>
<PB N="276" REF="301"/>
and her daughter <HI>Matilda:</HI> and for the maintenance of a master, brothers and sisters, and other poor persons. In 1273, <HI>Elinor,</HI> widow of <HI>Henry,</HI> possessed herself of it, dissolved the old foundation, refounded it in honor of the same saint, for a master, three brethren chaplains, three sisters, ten <HI>Bedes</HI> women, and six poor scholars. Queen <HI>Philippa,</HI> wife of <HI>Edward</HI> III. was a great benefactress to this hospital: and to this day it remains under queenly patronage, according to the reservation made by the pious re-foundress <HI>Elinor.</HI> Our present gracious queen is the twenty-ninth royal patroness.</P>
<P>THE mastership is a sinecure of considerable value. In this hospital is a house for him, and all its members. The reader will find the disposition of them, in the plan printed by Mr. <HI>Nichols,</HI> in the account of <HI>St. Katherine</HI>'s hospital, and its colle∣giate church; a posthumous work of that able antiquary the late <HI>Andrew Coltee Ducarel,</HI> LL. D. He was interred in the col∣legiate church, where a plain piece of marble informs us of little more than the period of his existence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHURCH.</NOTE>THE church is a handsome <HI>gothic</HI> building, but almost quite lost in the various houses, which shut it up from public view. The east window is very elegant; and in the modern improve∣ments there is the utmost propriety preserved in the imitation of the antient architecture. The wooden pulpit is a curiosity: on its eight sides are represented the antient building, and different gates of the hospital; beneath each compartment extend, EZRA THE SCRIBE—STOOD UPON A—PULPIT OF WOOD — WHICH HE HAD—MADE FOR THE—PREACHIN <HI>Neh— e.</HI> chap. viii. 4.</P>
<P>UNDER one of the stalls is a very good carving of the head of
<PB N="277" REF="302"/>
queen <HI>Philippa,</HI> and another of her spouse. They bear a resem∣blance to the monumental sculpture of those great personages.</P>
<P>THE most remarkable monument is that of <HI>John Holland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">TOMB OF JOHN HOLLAND, DUKE OF EXETER.</NOTE> duke of <HI>Exeter,</HI> who lies recumbent, with a fillet round his head, and in a long gown, the weeds of peace. By him are placed the figure of his first wife <HI>Anne,</HI> daughter of <HI>Edmund</HI> earl <HI>Stafford,</HI> and widow of <HI>Edmund Mortimer,</HI> earl of <HI>March;</HI> and another of his sister <HI>Constance,</HI> first, wife to <HI>Thomas Mowbray,</HI> duke of <HI>Nor∣folk;</HI> and afterwards to Sir <HI>John Grey,</HI> eldest son of <HI>Reginald</HI> lord <HI>Grey,</HI> of <HI>Ruthen.</HI> This potent peer was a great benefactor to the hospital, founded in it a chauntry; and bequeathed to the high altar in the church,
<Q>a cuppe of byroll, garnished with gold, perles, and precious stones, to be put in the sacrament,</Q>
and numbers of other valuable effects. He died in peace in 1447, a wonderful thing in his family; not fewer than four of this great house, in little more than a century, fell by violent deaths.</P>
<P>BELOW <HI>St. Catherine's,</HI> on the river side,<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE BERE-HOUSE.</NOTE> stood the great breweries or <HI>Bere-house,</HI> as it is called in the map published in the first volume of the <HI>Civitates Orbis.</HI> They were subject to regulations as early as the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VII; who, in 1492, licenses <HI>John Merchant,</HI> a <HI>Fleming,</HI> to export fifty tons of ale called <HI>Berre</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rymer,</HI> xii. 271.</NOTE>. And in the same reign one <HI>Geffry Gate,</HI> pro∣bably an officer of the king's, spoiled the brewhouses at <HI>St. Cathe∣rine</HI>'s twice, either for sending too much abroad unlicensed, or for brewing it too weak for their home customers <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Maitland,</HI> ii. 1017.</NOTE>. The demand for this article from foreign parts encreased to a high degree; in
<PB N="278" REF="303"/>
the reign of queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> five hundred tons were exported at once, as is expressed for the queen's use, at one time; probably for the service of her army in the low countries; three hundred and fifty barrels to <HI>Embden;</HI> three hundred to <HI>Amsterdam;</HI> and again eight hundred to <HI>Embden.</HI> At this time there seems to have been a free exportation, except when checked by proclamation, for fear of enhancing the price of corn, by excess of brewing in scarce times; but even then it was permitted by the royal licence <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ype's Stow,</HI> ii. 292.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THOSE who wish to attempt to restore the spirit of the boister∣ous reign of <HI>Henry,</HI> as far as depended on the boasted <HI>British</HI> liquor, may use the following receipt <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mes, &amp;c of <HI>London,</HI> printed in</NOTE>:

<P>IT is not in my power to trace the progress of this important article of trade. Let me only say that it is now a national con∣cern: for the duty on malt, from <HI>July</HI> 5th 1785, to the same day 1786, produced a million and half of money <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>Vast quantities of our beer or porter are sent abroad; I do not know the sum, but the following extract from a newspaper, will shew the greatness of our Breweries.</P>
<P>The following is a list of the chief porter brewers of <HI>London,</HI> and the barrels of strong beer they have brewed, from <HI>Midsummer</HI> 1786, to <HI>Midsummer</HI> 1787. And we make no doubt but it will give our readers much pleasure, to find such a capi∣tal article of trade solely confined to <HI>England;</HI> and the more so, as a large quan∣tity of the porter makes a considerable part of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r exports.</P>

<P>THE great extent of <HI>Wapping,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">WAPPING.</NOTE> which stretches along the river side from <HI>St. Katherine</HI>'s, arose from the opinion of the commis∣sioners of sewers, in 1571, that nothing could secure the manor from the depredations of the water, more effectually than the build∣ing of houses: for they thought the tenants would not fail being attentive to the safety of their lives and property. The plan suc∣ceeded, and in our days we see a vast and populous town added to the antient precincts (which had stagnated for ages). A long narrow street, well paved, and handsomely flagged on both sides, winding along the banks of the <HI>Thames,</HI> as far as the end of <HI>Lime∣house,</HI> an extent of near two miles; and inhabited by multitudes of seafaring men, alternate occupants of sea and land: their float∣ing tenements lie before them. In fact, the whole river, from the bridge, for a vast way, is covered with a double forest of masts, with a narrow avenue in mid-channel. These give impor∣tance and safety to the state, and supply the mutual wants of the universe. We send the necessaries and luxuries of our island to every part; and, in return, receive every <HI>pabulum</HI> which should
<PB N="282" REF="307"/>
satiate the most luxurious, wealth that ought to make avarice cry, Hold! enough, and matters for speculation for the laudable and delicate longings of the intellectual world.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">SHADWELL.</NOTE>THE hamlet of <HI>Shadwell</HI> is a continuation of the buildings along the river. Between the houses and the water, in all this long tract of street, are frequent docks, and small building yards. The passenger is often surprized with the sight of the prow of a ship rising over the street, and the hulls of new ones appearing at numbers of openings. But all that filth and stench, which <HI>Stow</HI> complains of, exists no longer. <HI>Execution Dock</HI> stills remains at <HI>Wapping,</HI> and is in use as often as a melancholy occasion requires. The criminals are to this day executed on a temporary gallows placed at low-water mark; but the custom of leaving the body to be overflowed by three tides, has long since been omitted.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">RADCLIFF.</NOTE>THE village of <HI>Radcliff,</HI> to which <HI>Wapping</HI> now joins, is of some antiquity. From hence the gallant Sir <HI>Hugh Willoughby,</HI> on <HI>May</HI> the 20th, 1553, took his departure on his fatal voyage for discovering the north-east passage to <HI>China.</HI> He sailed with great pomp by <HI>Greenwich,</HI> where the court then lay. Mutual honors were payed on both sides. The council and courtiers ap∣peared at the windows, and the people covered the shores. The young king alone lost the noble and novel sight, for he then lay on his death-bed; so that the principal object of the parade was disappointed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hackluyt,</HI> i. 239.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">LIMEHOUSE.</NOTE>LIMEHOUSE is a continuation of the town along the river-side: it is a new creation; and its church, one of the fifty new churches, was finished in 1724. This may be called the end of <HI>London</HI> on the
<PB N="283" REF="308"/>
water-side; but it is continued by means of <HI>Poplar,</HI> a chapelry in the parish of <HI>Stepney</HI> (antiently a regal manor, so named from its abundance of poplar trees) across the upper part of the <HI>Isle of Dogs,</HI> in a strait line to the river <HI>Lea,</HI> the division of this county from <HI>Essex.</HI></P>
<P>WAPPING, <HI>Shadwell,</HI> and <HI>Limehouse,</HI> have their respective churches; and <HI>Poplar</HI> its chapel. The two first have nothing to attract the eye. <HI>Limehouse</HI> has its aukward tower, a dull square rising out of another, embellished with pilasters; heavy pinnacles rise out of the uppermost: the whole proves how unhappily Mr. <HI>Hawksmoor,</HI> the architect of <HI>Bloomsbury</HI> church, exerted his genius in the obsolete art of steeple-building. The church in question is one of the new fifty. In the year 1730 it was added to the bills of mortality.</P>
<P>IN our walk through <HI>Limehouse,</HI> we crossed the New Cut, or <HI>Poplar</HI> canal, near its discharge into the river. This was begun about twenty years ago; runs by <HI>Bromley,</HI> and joins the river <HI>Lea</HI> near <HI>Bow,</HI> where barges enter by means of a lock called <HI>Bow-lock.</HI> This canal is about a mile and a quarter in length; and serves to bring to our capital corn, malt, and flour, from the neighborhood of <HI>Hertford,</HI> and several other counties, which put their produc∣tions on board the barges at that town. It is also of great use to convey to the <HI>Thames</HI> the produce of the great distilleries near <HI>Bow;</HI> and also to the internal counties coals, and several articles from the metropolis. This canal saves the great circuit of passing down to <HI>Lea-mouth,</HI> and thence round the <HI>Isle of Dogs;</HI> a navigation often impeded by contrary winds and tides, which frequently fall out so adverse, as to occasion great delays. Yet this canal by no means annihilates the use of the river <HI>Lea</HI>
<PB N="284" REF="309"/>
to and from its mouth; but barges go indifferently either way, as conveniency, or the circumstances above-mentioned, occur. Be∣sides, many barges will enter the river <HI>Lea</HI> to save the navigation expences of the New Cut.</P>
<P>LIMEHOUSE dock is a little farther to the south-east, and is much used.</P>
<P>WE finished our walk, and dined at a small house called the <HI>Folly,</HI> on the water's edge, almost opposite to the splendid hospital at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> where we sat for some hours enjoying the delicious view of the river, and the moving picture of a succession of shipping perpetually passing and repassing.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">BILLS OF MORTALITY.</NOTE>IT is wonderful, that in this great city there should have been no regular <HI>Census;</HI> but that we must depend on the account of the number of inhabitants from the uncertain calculation of the bills of mortality. I will allow them to be delivered annually, by the only censors we have, <HI>the company of parish-clerks,</HI> with all possi∣ble accuracy, as far as their knowlege extends: but, as it is ad∣mitted that a number of people find their burials in coemeteries without the bills, equal nearly to those which are annually reported to be interred within their jurisdiction, the uncertainty of the enu∣meration collected from them must be allowed. In the last year, 19,697 were buried within the bills: if the above assertion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Richardson.</HI></NOTE> is well founded, the sum must be 39,394. I refer the decision of the numbers of inhabitants to the skilful in calculation. I have heard it averred that the present number is a million. <HI>Maitland</HI> gives the total, in the time of his publication (1756) to have
<PB N="285" REF="310"/>
been 725,341 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Maitland,</HI> ii. 755.—This book is dedicated to <HI>Slingsby Bethel,</HI> <ABBR>esq</ABBR> who was lord mayor in that year.</NOTE>. The increase of <HI>London</HI> since his days gives a probability that the enumeration is not much exaggerated.</P>
<P>BILLS of mortality took rise in 1592, in which began a great pestilence, which continued till the 18th of <HI>December,</HI> 1595. During this period they were kept in order to ascertain the num∣ber of persons who died: but when the plague ceased, the bills were discontinued. They were resumed again in 1603. At the original institution, there were only a hundred and nine parishes: others were gradually added, and, by the year 1681, the number was a hundred and thirty-two: since that time fourteen more have been added, so that the whole amounts to a hundred and forty-six; viz.

<P>AMONG the multitudes who fall victims to disease, is a melan∣choly account of the rural youth, which crowd here in numbers, laboring under the delusion of preferment: some perish soon, without even attaining a service; and, urged by want, fall under the cognizance of justice. Others get admission into shops, or into places, where they experience hard work, hard wages, hard lodgings, and scanty food. They soon fall ill, are neglected, or flung into an hospital when passed all relief, where they perish. Their native villages want their innocent labor, and the whole
<PB N="286" REF="311"/>
rustic community, I may say the whole kingdom, suffers for the indiscrcet ambition of these unhappy youths or of their simple parents.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">RADCLIFF HIGHWAY.</NOTE>WE varied our road on our return, by taking that of <HI>Radcliff Highway,</HI> a broad and very long street, ending in <HI>East Smithfield.</HI> On the north side stands another of the new fifty churches, <HI>St. George</HI>'s <HI>Middlesex;</HI> square rises out of square, to compose the steeple; its upper story is incomprehensible, the outside stuck around with chimney-like columns, square at the lower parts, above making a sudden transition into the round. This church was began in 1715; finished in 1729: and, by the eccentricity of the style, may fairly be suspected to have had Mr. <HI>Hawksmoor</HI> for its builder.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">RAG-FAIR.</NOTE>AT the end of this street we found ourselves in the midst of <HI>Rag-fair,</HI> in the fullest hour of business. The articles of com∣merce by no means belye the name. There is no expressing the poverty of the goods: nor yet their cheapness. A distinguished merchant, engaged with a purchaser, observing me to look on him with great attention, called out to me, as his customer was going off with his bargain, to observe that man, <HI>For,</HI> says he, <HI>I have ac∣tually cloathed him for fourteen pence.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">ABBY OF ST. MARY OF THE GRACES.</NOTE>A LITTLE farther on to the east, stood the abby of <HI>St. Mary of the Graces,</HI> called also the <HI>New Abby,</HI> and <HI>Eastminster,</HI> in opposition to <HI>Westminster,</HI> in respect to its situation. It was founded by <HI>Edward</HI> III. in 1349, in the new church-yard of the <HI>Holy Trinity,</HI> and filled with <HI>Cistertians.</HI> That church-yard was made by <HI>John Corey,</HI> clerk, on occasion of the dreadful pestilence which raged in that reign, so that there was not room in the common church-yards to inter the dead. <HI>Edward</HI> was moved to his piety by a

<Q>is builded a large store-house for victual, and convenient ovens are builded for baking of bisket to serve hir majesties shippes.</Q>
The present Victualling Office succeeded the original building, and is allotted for the same purpose.</P>
<P>FROM hence I passed by the <HI>Tower,</HI> to the Custom-house,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CUSTOM-HOUSE.</NOTE> a little to the west of that fortress. On this spot is the busy con∣course of all nations, who pay their tribute towards the support of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> The present building is of brick and stone; be∣fore which, ships of three hundred and fifty tons can lie and dis∣charge their cargo. There was one here, built as early as the year 1385, by <HI>John Churchman</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Strype's Stow,</HI> ii. book iv. 114.</NOTE>, one of the sheriffs of <HI>London;</HI> but at that period, and long after, the customs were collected in different parts of the city, and in a very irregular manner. About the year 1559 the loss to the revenue was first discovered, and an act passed to compel people to land their goods in such places as were appointed by the commissioners of the revenue; and this was the spot fixed on: a Custom-house was erected, which, being de∣stroyed by the great fire, was rebuilt by <HI>Charles</HI> II. In 1718, it underwent the same fate, and was restored in its present form.
<PB N="288" REF="313"/>
Before the Custom-house was established here, the principal place for receiving the duties was at <HI>Billingsgate.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CUSTOMS IN 979.</NOTE> As early as 979, or the reign of <HI>Etheldred,</HI> a small vessel was to pay <HI>ad Bilynggesgate</HI> one penny halfpenny as a toll; a greater, bearing sails, one penny; a keel or hulk <HI>(Ceol vel Hulcus)</HI> four pence; a ship laden with wood, one piece for toll; and a boat with fish, one halfpenny; or a larger, one penny <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Brompton</HI> x Scriptores, i. col. 897.</NOTE>.

<P>IN 1641, just before the beginning of our troubles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">IN 1641.</NOTE> the customs brought in £. 500,000 a year; the effect of a long series of peaceful days. The effects of our civil broils appeared strongly in 1666, when they suffered a decrease of £. 110,000. From the year 1671 to 1688, they were at a medium £. 555,752.<NOTE PLACE="marg">IN 1666, 1671.</NOTE> In the year 1709, notwithstanding a fierce war raged for many years,<NOTE PLACE="marg">IN 1709.</NOTE> they were raised to £. 2,319,320.

<P>IN <HI>Water-lane,</HI> a little to the north-west of the Custom-house,<NOTE PLACE="marg">TRINITY-HOUSE.</NOTE> is the Trinity-house; a society founded in 1515, at a period in which the <HI>British</HI> navy began to assume a system. The founder was Sir <HI>Thomas Spert,</HI> comptroller of the navy, and commander of the great ship <HI>Henry Grace de Dieu.</HI> It is a corporation, con∣sisting of a master, four wardens, eight assistants, and eighteen elder brethren <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The whole corporation are usually called <HI>The Thirty-one Brethren.</HI> See a full account in <HI>Strype's St<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w,</HI> ii. book v. p. 286-7.</NOTE>; selected from commanders in the navy and the merchants service; and now and then a compliment is payed to one or two of our first nobility.

from serving on board our ships without licence; punish seamen for mutiny and desertion; hear and determine complaints of offi∣cers and men in the merchants service, but liable to appeal to the judge of the court of admiralty; superintend the deepening and cleansing of the river <HI>Thames,</HI> and have under their jurisdiction the ballast-office; have powers to buy lands, and receive dona∣tions for charitable uses; and, in consequence, relieve annually many thousands of poor seamen, their widows, and orphans.</P>
<P>THIS house is unworthy of the greatness of its design. In the council-room are some portraits of eminent men. The most re∣markable is that of Sir <HI>John Leake,</HI> with his lank grey locks, and a loose night gown, with a mien very little indicative of his high courage, and active spirit. He was the greatest commander of his time, and engaged in most actions of note during the reigns of king <HI>William</HI> and queen <HI>Anne.</HI> To him was committed the despe∣rate, but successful attempt of breaking the boom, previous to the relief of <HI>Londonderry.</HI> He distinguished himself greatly at the battle of <HI>La Hogue;</HI> assisted at the taking of <HI>Gibraltar;</HI> and after∣wards, as commander in chief, reduced <HI>Barcelona;</HI> took <HI>Cartha∣gena,</HI> and brought <HI>Sardinia</HI> and <HI>Minorca</HI> to submit to <HI>Charles,</HI> rival to <HI>Philip</HI> for the crown of <HI>Spain.</HI> He was made a lord of the admiralty, but declined the offer of being head of the commission; at the accession of <HI>George</HI> I. averse to the new family, he retired; but with the approving pension of £. 600 a year. He lived pri∣vately at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> where he died in 1720, and was buried in a manner suitable to his merits, in the church at <HI>Stepney.</HI></P>

This was a small port for the reception of shipping, and, for a considerable time, the most important place for the landing of almost every article of commerce. It was not till the reign of king <HI>William</HI> that it became celebrated as a fish-market; who, in 1699, by act of parlement made it a free port for fish, which might be sold there every day in the week except <HI>Sunday.</HI> The object of this has long been frustrated, and the epicure who goes (as was a frequent practice) to <HI>Billingsgate</HI> to eat fish in perfection, will now be cruelly disappointed.</P>
<P>I CANNOT give a list of the fish most acceptable in the <HI>Saxon</HI>

Evidences of this great work were found in the place called <HI>The Dock Head,</HI> at <HI>Redriff,</HI> where it began.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">WHEN BUILT;</NOTE>THE bridge originated from the public spirit of the college of priests of <HI>St. Mary Overie.</HI> Before, there had been a ferry, left by her parents to their only daughter <HI>Mary;</HI> who, out of the pro∣fits, founded a nunnery and endowed it with the profits of the boat. This house was afterwards converted into the college of
<PB N="295" REF="320"/>
priests, who not only built the bridge but kept it in repair: but it must be understood that the first bridge was of timber,<NOTE PLACE="marg">FIRST OF TIMBER.</NOTE> the mate∣rials at hand, and most probably rudely put together. This ac∣count is given by <HI>Stow,</HI> from the report of <HI>Bartholomew Linsted,</HI> alias <HI>Fowle,</HI> last prior of <HI>St. Marie Overie;</HI> but was doubted, because the work has been supposed to be too great, and too dis∣interested for a college of priests, who were to give up the certain profits of the ferry, for those resulting precariously from an expen∣sive undertaking. Even the existence of a religious house before the Conquest has been suspected: but the <HI>Domesday</HI> book puts that out of doubt, by informing us, <HI>Ipse episcopus habet unum monasterium in Sudwerche.</HI> Numbers of useful, as well as pious works, in early days, originated from the instigation of the church∣men, who often had the honor of being called the founders, when the work itself was performed by their devotees. Neither is it to be supposed that they could keep it in repair: the same zeal which impelled people to contribute to the building, operated in the vestiture of land for its future support; and this appears to have been done by several instances; yet the endowments were so small, that a supplementary tax was often raised.</P>
<P>IN 1136, the bridge was burnt down. By the year 1163 it grew so ruinous as to occasion its being rebuilt, under the care of one <HI>Peter,</HI> curate of <HI>St. Mary Colechurch,</HI> a celebrated architect of those times. It was soon after determined to build a bridge of stone, and, about the year 1176,<NOTE PLACE="marg">REBUILT IN 1176 WITH STONE.</NOTE> the same <HI>Peter</HI> was employed again. It proved a work of thirty-three years: the architect died four years before it was completed; and another clergyman, <HI>Isen∣bert,</HI> master of the schools of <HI>Xainctes,</HI> was recommended to the citizens, by king <HI>John,</HI> for the honor of finishing it; but they
<PB N="296" REF="321"/>
rejected their prince's choice, and committed the work to three merchants of <HI>London,</HI> who completed it in 1209. <HI>Peter</HI> was buried in a beautiful chapel, probably of his own construction, dedicated to <HI>St. Thomas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> IN ONE OF THE PIERE.</NOTE> which stood on the east side, in the ninth pier from the north end, and had an entrance from the river, as well as the street, by a winding staircase. It was beautifully paved with black and white marble, and in the middle was a tomb, sup∣posed to contain the remains of <HI>Peter</HI> the architect.</P>
<P>THIS great work was founded on enormous piles, driven as closely as possible together: on their tops were laid long planks ten inches thick, strongly bolted; and on them were placed the base of the pier, the lowermost stones of which were bedded in pitch, to prevent the water from damaging the work: round all were the piles which are called the <HI>Sterlings,</HI> designed for the pre∣servation of the foundation piles. These contracted the space between the piers so greatly, as to occasion, at the retreat of every tide, a fall of five feet, or a number of temporary cataracts, which, since the foundation of the bridge, have occasioned the loss of many thousand lives. The water, at spring-tides, rises to the height of about eighteen feet. The length of this vast work is nine hun∣dred and fifteen feet, the exact breadth of the river. The num∣ber of arches was nineteen, of unequal dimensions, and greatly deformed by the sterlings, and the houses on each side, which overhung and leaned in a most terrific manner. In most places they hid the arches, and nothing appeared but the rude piers. I well remember the street on <HI>London-bridge,</HI> narrow, darksome, and dangerous to passengers from the multitude of carriages: frequent arches of strong timber crossed the street, from the tops of the houses, to keep them together, and from falling into the
<PB N="297" REF="322"/>
river. Nothing but use could preserve the rest of the inmates, who soon grew deaf to the noise of the falling waters, the clamors of watermen, or the frequent shrieks of drowning wretches. Most of the houses were tenanted by pin or needle makers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PIN-MAKERS.</NOTE> and oeco∣nomical ladies were wont to drive from the <HI>St. James</HI>'s end of the town, to make cheap purchases. <HI>Fuller</HI> tells us, that <HI>Spanish</HI> needles were made here first in <HI>Cheapside,</HI> by a negro, who died without communicating the art. <HI>Elias Crowse,</HI> a <HI>German,</HI> in the reign of <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> was more liberal, and first taught the method to the <HI>English. Fuller</HI>'s definition of a needle is excellent, <HI>quasi</HI> NE IDLE.</P>
<P>IN the bridge were three openings on each side, with ballu∣strades, to give passengers a sight of the water and shipping. In one part had been a draw-bridge, useful either by way of defence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">DRAW-BRIDGE.</NOTE> or for the admission of ships into the upper part of the river. This was protected by a strong tower. It served to repulse <HI>Faucon-bridge</HI> the Bastard, in his general assault on the city in 1471, with a set of banditti, under pretence of rescuing the unfortunate <HI>Henry,</HI> then confined in the <HI>Tower.</HI> Sixty houses were burnt on the bridge on the occasion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Holinshed,</HI> 690.</NOTE>. It also served to check, and in the end annihilate, the ill-conducted insurrection of Sir <HI>Thomas Wiat,</HI> in the reign of queen <HI>Mary.</HI> The top of this tower, in the sad and turbulent days of this kingdom, used to be the shambles of hu∣man flesh, and covered with heads or quarters of unfortunate partizans. Even so late as the year 1598, <HI>Hentzner,</HI> the <HI>German</HI> traveller, with <HI>German</HI> accuracy, counted on it above thirty

heads <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Fugitive Pieces,</HI> vol. ii. 243.</NOTE>. The old map of the city, in 1597, represents them in a most horrible cluster.</P>
<P>AT the south end of the bridge one <HI>Peter Corbis,</HI> a <HI>Dutchman</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Stow's Survaie.—London and its Environs, <HI>iv. 146.</HI></NOTE>, in the year 1582, invented an engine to force the water of the <HI>Thames</HI> into leaden pipes, to supply many of the adjacent parts of the city. It has, since that time, been so greatly improved, by the skill of the <HI>English</HI> mechanics, as to become a most curious as well as useful piece of machinery, and to be extremely worthy the attention of that branch of science.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">DREADFUL CA∣LAMITY BY FIRE.</NOTE>I MUST not quit the bridge, without noticing an unparalleled calamity, which happened on it within four years after it was finished. A fire began on it at the <HI>Southwark</HI> end; multitudes of people rushed out of <HI>London</HI> to extinguish it; while they were engaged in this charitable design, the fire seized on the opposite end, and hemmed in the crowd.

About the year 1536, when his master lived in one of these tremendous houses, a servant-maid was playing with his only daughter in her arms, in a window over the water, and accidentally dropt the child. Young <HI>Osborne,</HI> who was witness to the misfortune, instantly sprung into the river, and, beyond all expectation, brought her safe to the terrified family. Several persons of rank payed their addresses to her,
<PB N="299" REF="324"/>
when she was marriageable; among others, the earl of <HI>Shrewsbury:</HI> but Sir <HI>William</HI> gratefully decided in favor of <HI>Osborne;</HI> OSBORNE, says he, <HI>saved her,</HI> and OSBORNE <HI>shall enjoy her</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Stow,</HI> ii. book v. 133.—and <HI>Collins</HI>'s Peerage, i. 235.</NOTE>. In her right he possessed a great fortune. He became sheriff of <HI>London</HI> in 1575; and lord mayor in 1582. I have seen the picture of his master at <HI>Kiveton,</HI> the seat of the duke of <HI>Leeds,</HI> a half length on board; his dress is a black gown furred, a red vest and sleeve, a gold chain, and a bonnet. He served the office of lord mayor in 1559; and died in 1566. <HI>Strype</HI> mistakes, when he says, that Sir <HI>William</HI> died in 1599, and was buried in the cathedral of <HI>St. Paul:</HI> another person of the same name lies there, under the handsome monument <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Engraven in <HI>Dugdale</HI>'s History of <HI>St. Paul's,</HI> 66.</NOTE> ascribed by our old historian to the former.</P>
<P>Or the multitudes who have perished in this rapid descent, the names of no one, of any note, has reached my knowlege, except that of Mr. <HI>Temple,</HI> only son of the great Sir <HI>William Temple.</HI> His end was dreadful, as it was premeditated. He had, a week before, accepted, from king <HI>William,</HI> the office of Secretary of War. On the 14th of <HI>April,</HI> 1689, he hired a boat on the <HI>Thames,</HI> and directed the waterman to shoot the bridge; at that in∣stant he flung himself into the torrent, and, having filled his pockets with stones, to destroy all chance of safety <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rereshy's Memoirs, <HI>346.</HI></NOTE>, instantly sunk. In the boat was found a note to this effect:
<Q>My folly, in undertak∣ing what I could not perform, whereby some misfortunes have befallen the king's service, is the cause of my putting myself to

I hope his father's reflection, on the occasion, was a parental apology, not his real sentiments:

In four days it consumed every part of this noble city within the walls, except what lies within a line drawn from the north part of <HI>Coleman-street,</HI> and just to the south-west of <HI>Leaden-hall,</HI> and from thence to the <HI>Tower.</HI> Its ravages were also ex∣tended without the walls, to the west, as far as <HI>Fetter-lane,</HI> and the <HI>Temple.</HI> As it begun in <HI>Pudding-lane,</HI> it ended in <HI>Smithfield</HI> at <HI>Pye-corner;</HI> which might occasion the inscription with the figure of a boy, on a house in the last place, now almost erased, which attributes <HI>the fire of</HI> LONDON <HI>to the sin of gluttony.</HI> I leave the reader to consult the second volume of the <HI>City Remembrancer,</HI> for the melancholy detail.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="328"/>SIR <HI>Christopher Wren</HI> was coeval to this misfortune. The plans his great genius offered to the public for rebuilding the city, with genuine taste, and a splendor worthy of ancient <HI>Rome,</HI> were unfor∣tunately rejected. Perhaps the times are not greatly to be blam∣ed; there were a thousand difficulties in respect to the division of property; there was, in a vast commercial city, such as <HI>London,</HI> a hurry to resume their former occupations, and a prejudice for ancient sites. It was difficult to persuade people to relinquish, for a mere work of taste, a spot productive of thousands, to them or their predecessors. These things considered, it is not to be won∣dered that we are left to admire, on paper only, the vast designs of our great architect. But still he was the restorer of several of our public buildings: many of our temples arose with improved beauty from his plans; and several other buildings, which we have had, or shall have occasion of mentioning.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">THE MONUMENT.</NOTE>THAT astonishing proof of his genius, the <HI>Monument,</HI> is placed on the side of <HI>Fish-street,</HI> very near to the spot where the calamity began;
<Q><L>Where <HI>London</HI>'s column, pointing at the skies,</L>
<L>Like a tall bully lifts its head and lyes.</L></Q>
It is a <HI>Doric</HI> column, two hundred and two feet high, fluted, and finished with a trifling urn with flames, instead of a noble statue of the reigning king, as the great architect proposed. On the west side of the pedestal is a bas relief, cut by <HI>Gabriel Cibber,</HI> in ad∣mirable taste. It represents emblematically this sad <HI>catastrophe; Charles</HI> is seen, surrounded with Liberty, Genius, and Science, giving directions for the restoring of the city. Here the sculptor
<PB N="303" REF="329"/>
found, luckily, one example to compliment the attention of the thoughtless monarch towards the good of his subjects; for, during the horrors of the conflagration, and after it was subdued, his en∣deavours to stop the evil, and to remedy the effect, were truly indefatigable. The king was seriously affected by this calamity, and many emotions of piety and devotion were excited in him. There was, for a short time, great reason to expect the fruits of this his brief return to Heaven: but they were quickly blasted by the uncommon wickedness of the people about him, who, by every prophane witticism on the recent calamity, and even by suggest∣ing that it was the blessing of God, to humble this rebellious city, and to prepare it for his yoke, soon removed every good thought from the royal breast <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Continuation of Lord <HI>Glarendon</HI>'s Life, 675.</NOTE>. This noble column was begun in 1671; and finished in 1677, at the expence of £. 14,500. A melancholy period of party rage: and the inscription was permitted. The damage sustained by the cruel element, was computed at ten mil∣lions seven hundred and sixteen thousand pounds. But Provi∣dence, mingling mercy with justice, suffered only the lost of a very few lives.</P>
<P>GREAT as this calamity was, yet it proved the providential cause of putting a stop to one of a far more tremendous nature. The plague, which, for a series of ages, had, with very short inter∣vals, visited our capital in its most dreadful forms, never appeared there again after the rebuilding of the city in a more open and airy manner, which removed several nusanoes; which, if not the actual origin of a plague, was assuredly one great <HI>pabulum,</HI> when
<PB N="304" REF="330"/>
it had seized our streets. The last was in the year 1665, when in about six months, by the smallest computation, a hundred and threescore thousand people fell by the destroying angel.</P>
<P>ALMOST opposite to the place where the monument now stands, was a large stone house, the habitation of <HI>Edward,</HI> our famous black prince, the flower of <HI>English</HI> chivalry. In <HI>Stow</HI>'s time it was altered to a common hosterie or inn, having a black bell for the sign <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Survai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> 403.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">FISHMONGERS-HALL.</NOTE>AT a small distance, to the west of the bridge, is <HI>Fishmongers-hall,</HI> a very handsome building, erected since the destruction of the old hall by the great fire. It faces the river, and commands a fine view of the water and the bridge. In the court-room are several pictures of the various sorts of vendible fishes. A printed catalogue of the species and varieties, with their seasons, was pre∣sented to me when I visited the place. At this and every other hall I met with the utmost urbanity. As an humble historian of the fishy tribe, I trust that I am not to be condemned to the <HI>Pygmalion</HI> prospect of these delicacies; but, on my next visit to town, may be honored with a card, in order to form a practical judgment of what hitherto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> only feasted my eyes!!!</P>
<P>IN the great hall is a wooden statue of the brave Sir <HI>William Walworth,</HI> armed with his rebel-killing dagger; here is also another of <HI>St. Peter:</HI> the former was of this company; the latter with great propriety is adopted as its titular saint. The arms of the benefactors are beautifully expressed in painted glass on the several windows.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="331"/>THIS is one of the twelve great companies: it originally was divided into <HI>Stock-mongers,</HI> and <HI>Saltfish-mongers;</HI> the first were in∣corporated in 1433; a period in which we had very considerable trade with <HI>Iceland</HI> in that very article <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Arct.

This company pays £. 500 a year to charitable uses.</P>
<P>THE next place I shall take notice of, to the west of this hall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">COLD HARBOUR.</NOTE> was <HI>Cold Harbour,</HI> mentioned as a tenement as early as the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> II. A magnificent house was, in after-times, built on the spot, which, from its occupant, Sir <HI>John Poultney,</HI> four times mayor of <HI>London,</HI> was, in the style of the times, called <HI>Poultney-Inn:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">POULTNEY-INN.</NOTE> for the town habitations of most of the great men were called <HI>Inns.

In feudal days the town had no pleasures to attract the great; they seldom came there but to support a cause (as now and then is the case with a modern senator), to make or unmake a king, or lay the founda∣tion of civil broils. In 1397, it was the <HI>Inn</HI> of <HI>John Holland,</HI> duke of <HI>Exeter,</HI> and earl of <HI>Huntingdon,</HI> who here gave a din∣ner, and doubtlessly a very magnificent one, to his half-brother

In 1485, <HI>Richard</HI> III, granted it to <HI>Garter</HI> king of arms, and his brother heralds.

In 1479, it was even rebuilt in a most magnificent manner, by the merchants of the <HI>Steel-yard.</HI> As they decreased in strength, and we grew more powerful and more politic, we began to abridge their privileges. We found that this potent company, by their weight, interfered with the interest of the natives, and damped their spirit of trade.

<P>AT this time it is the great repository of the imported iron, which furnishes our metropolis with that necessary material.

<P>IN the triumph of Riches, <HI>Plutus</HI> is represented in a golden car, and <HI>Fortune</HI> sitting before him, flinging money into the laps of people, holding up their garments to receive her favors: <HI>Ventidius</HI> is wrote under one; <HI>Gadareus</HI> under another; and <HI>Themistocles</HI> under a man kneeling beside the car: <HI>Croesus, Midas,</HI> and <HI>Tanta∣lus</HI> follow; <HI>Narcissus</HI> holds the horse of the first: over their heads, in the clouds, is <HI>Nemesis.</HI> There are various allegorical figures, I shall not attempt to explain.

<P>POVERTY appears in another car, mean and shattered, half naked, squalid, and meagre.

<Q><L>Hic CHRISTO chlamydem <HI>Martinus</HI> dimidiavit;</L>

<P>There is, besides, a statue of that saint in the same room; and another picture of him above stairs. Why this saint was selected as patron of the company I know not, except they imagined that the saint, actuated by good wine, had been inspired with good thoughts; which, according to the argument of <HI>James Howel,</HI> producing good works, brought a man to Heaven. And, to shew the moral in a contrary effect, here is a picture of <HI>Lot</HI> and his incestuous daughters, exemplifying the danger of the abuse of the best things.</P>
<P>THIS hall was built on ground given by Sir <HI>John Stodie,</HI> vint∣ner, lord mayor in 1357. It was called the manour of the <HI>Vintre.</HI> The <HI>Vintners,</HI> or <HI>Vintonners,</HI> were incorporated in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> III.

<PB N="312" REF="338"/>
Vintners</HI> who imported the wine, and <HI>Taverners</HI> who kept taverns, and retailed it for the former. The company flou∣rished so much, that, from its institution till the year 1711, it pro∣duced not fewer than fourteen lord mayors, many of which were the keepers of taverns. Yet, in the time of <HI>Edward</HI> III. the <HI>Gascoigne</HI> wines were not sold at the rate of above 4 <HI>d.</HI> a gallon; nor the <HI>Rhenish</HI> above 6 <HI>d.</HI> In 1379, red wine was 4 <HI>d.</HI> a gallon; and a little after, the price of a tun £. 4. As late as the year 1552, the <HI>Gu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nne</HI> and <HI>Gascoigne</HI> wines were sold at 8 <HI>d.</HI> a gallon; and no wines were to exceed the price of 12<HI>d.</HI> To restrain luxury, it was at the same time enacted, that no person, except those who could expend 100 marks annually, or was worth 1000 marks, or was the son of a duke, marquiss, earl, viscount, or baron of the realm, should keep in his house any vessel of wine, for his family use, exceeding ten gallons, under penalty of ten pounds.</P>
<P>OUR great wine trade was at first with <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> and the neighboring provinces; it commenced as early as the Conquest, perhaps sooner <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cambden,</HI> i. 672.</NOTE>.

that is to say, The sayd <HI>Robert</HI> hath a soken or ward in the citie, that is, a wall of the canonrie of <HI>Saint Paul,</HI> as a man goeth downe the street, before the brewhouse of <HI>Saint Paul,</HI> unto the <HI>Thames,</HI> and so to the side of the mill, which is in the water that commeth down from the <HI>Fleet-bridge,</HI> and goeth so by <HI>London</HI> wals, betwixt the Friers preachers and <HI>Ludgate,</HI> and so returneth backe by the house of the sayd Friers, unto the sayd wall of the sayd canonrie of <HI>Saint Paul,</HI> that is, all the parish of <HI>Saint Andrew,</HI> which is in the gift of his ancestors, by the sayd signiority: and so the said <HI>Robert</HI> hath, appendant unto the sayd soken, all these things underwritten: That hee ought to have a sokemanrie, or the same ward; and if any of the soke∣manry be impleaded in the <HI>Guild-hall,</HI> of any thing that touch∣eth not the body of the maior that for the time is, or that toucheth the body of no sheriffe, it is not lawful for the soke∣man of the sokemanry of the sayd <HI>Robert;</HI> and the maior, and his citizens of <HI>London,</HI> ought to grant him to have a court, and in his court he ought to bring his judgements, as it is assented and agreed upon in the <HI>Guild hall,</HI> that shall be given them.</Q></P>

Let me say, that the king-making earl came attended with six hundred men, all in red jackets embroidered, with ragged staves, before and behind, and were lodged in <HI>Warwick-lane;</HI> in whose house there was often the scene of boundless hospitality, the instrument of his furious spirit and boundless ambition.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="348"/>THIS mighty peer, in all his castles, was supposed to feed an∣nually thirty thousand men. But <HI>Baynard Castle</HI> was the scene of a still more important action in 1460; the youthful <HI>Edward</HI> assumed the name and dignity of king, confirmed by a number of persons of rank assembled in this place, after it had been conferred on him by a mixed and tumultuary multitude.</P>
<P>THE usurper <HI>Richard</HI> in the very same castle took on him the title of king. Here he was waited on by his creature <HI>Bucking∣ham,</HI> the mayor, and such part of the citizens who had been pre∣pared for the purpose of forcing the crown on the seemingly re∣luctant hypocrite. SHAKESPEARE has made an admirable scene cut of this part of our history <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Richard</HI> III. act iii. sc. vii.</NOTE>. His successor repaired, or per∣haps rebuilt <HI>Baynard Castle,</HI> and, as if foreseeing a long series of peaceful years, changed its form into that of a palace for quiet times. According to the view I have seen, it included a square court, with an octagonal tower in the center, and two in the front; between which were several square projections from top to bottom, with the windows in pairs one above the other; beneath was a bridge and stairs to the river <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shed,</HI> 793.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY often resided here, and from hence made several of his solemn processions.

<P>THIS castle was the residence of Sir <HI>William Sydney,</HI> who died chamberlain and steward to <HI>Edward</HI> VI. And in this place <HI>Mary,</HI> the gloomy queen of the gloomy namesake of the former,
<PB N="323" REF="349"/>
had her right to the throne resolved on; and from hence her par∣tizans sallied forth to proclame her lawful title. At this time it was the property and residence of <HI>William Herbert,</HI> earl of <HI>Pem∣broke,</HI> a particular favorer of the rightful heir. Her successor, <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> did him the honor of taking a supper with his lord∣ship: after supper, her majesty went on the water to shew her∣self to her subjects; her barge was instantly surrounded by hun∣dreds of boats; loud acclamations delivered from the heart, music, and fireworks testified the happiness they felt at the sight of this mother of her people. Early hours were then the fashion, for, notwithstanding this scene was exhibited on the 25th of <HI>April,</HI> she retired to her palace at 10 o'clock <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strype's Annals.</NOTE>.</P>

In early times, the southern side
<PB N="324" REF="350"/>
was guarded by a wall, close to the river, strengthened with towers. These are mentioned by <HI>Fitzstephens</HI> as having been ruined and undermined by the river. Lord <HI>Lyttelton</HI> justly observes, that after the building of the <HI>Tower</HI> and the bridge, there was no necessity of restoring these fortifications; as it was impossible (at lest after the bridge was flung across the <HI>Thames</HI>) for any fleet to annoy the city. It originally stood farther from the river than the present buildings and wharss, a considerable space between the street and the water having been gained in a long series of ages.</P>
<P>NOT far from <HI>Puddle Dock,</HI> in old times, stood an antient house of stone and timber, built by the lords of <HI>Berkely,</HI> a potent race of barons.

<P>ON one side of the court is a statue of <HI>Charles</HI> II: on the op∣posite, that of the notorious Sir <HI>John Cutler.</HI> I was greatly at a loss to learn how so much respect was shewn to a character so stigmatized for avarice. I think myself much indebted to Doc∣tor WARREN for the extraordinary history. It appears, by the annals of the college, that in the year 1674, a considerable sum of money had been subscribed by the fellows, for the erection of a new college, the old one having been consumed in the great fire, eight years before. It also appears, that Sir <HI>John Cutler,</HI> a near relation of Doctor <HI>Whistler,</HI> the president, was desirous of becom∣ing a benefactor. A committee was appointed to wait upon Sir <HI>John,</HI> to thank him for his kind intentions. He accepted their thanks, renewed his promise, and specified the part of the build∣ing of which he intended to bear the expence. In the year 1680, statues in honor of the king, and Sir <HI>John,</HI> were voted by the college: and nine years afterwards, the college being then com∣pleted,
<PB N="326" REF="352"/>
it was resolved to borrow money of Sir <HI>John Cutler,</HI> to discharge the college debt, but the sum is not specified. It ap∣pears, however, that in 1699, Sir <HI>John</HI>'s executors made a demand on the college of £. 7000; which sum was supposed to include the money actually lent, the money pretended to be given, but set down as a debt in Sir <HI>John</HI>'s books, and the interest on both. Lord <HI>Radnor,</HI> however, and Mr. <HI>Boulter,</HI> Sir <HI>John Cutler</HI>'s exe∣cutors, were prevaled on to accept £. 2000 from the college, and actually remitted the other five. So that Sir <HI>John</HI>'s promise, which he never performed, obtained him the statue, and the libe∣rality of his executors has kept it in its place ever since. But the college wisely have obliterated the inscription, which, in the warmth of its gratitude, it had placed beneath the figure.</P>

<P>THE first church is supposed to have been destroyed in the <HI>Dioclesian</HI> persecution, and to have been rebuilt in the reign of <HI>Constantine.</HI> This was again demolished by the pagan <HI>Saxons;</HI> and restored, in 603, by <HI>Sebert,</HI> a petty prince, ruling in these parts under <HI>Ethelbert</HI> king of <HI>Kent,</HI> the first Christian monarch of the <HI>Saxon</HI> race; who, at the instance of <HI>St. Augustine,</HI> appointed <HI>Meli∣tus</HI> the first bishop of <HI>London. Erkenwald,</HI> the son of king <HI>Offa,</HI> fourth in succession from <HI>Melitus,</HI> ornamented his cathedral very highly, and improved the revenues with his own patrimony. He was most deservedly canonized; for the very litter in which he was carried in his last illness, continued many centuries to cure fevers by the touch; and the very chips, carried to the sick, restored them to health.</P>
<P>WHEN the city, of <HI>London</HI> was destroyed by fire, in 1086, this church was burnt; the bishop <HI>Mauritius</HI> began to rebuild it, and laid the foundations, which remained till its second destruction, from the same cause, in the last century. Notwithstanding <HI>Mauri∣tius</HI> lived twenty years after he had begun this pious work, and
<PB N="330" REF="356"/>
bishop <HI>Beauvages</HI> enjoyed the see twenty more, yet, such was the grandeur of the design, that it remained unfinished. The first had the ruins of the <HI>Palatine</HI> tower bestowed on him, as materials for the building: and <HI>Henry</HI> I. bestowed on <HI>Beauvages</HI> part of the ditch belonging to the <HI>Tower,</HI> which, with purchases made by himself, enabled him to inclose the whole with a wall. The same monarch granted besides, that every ship, which brought stone for the church, should be exempted from toll; he gave him also all the great fish taken in his precincts, except the tongues; and lastly, he secured to him and his successor, the delicious tythes of all his venison in the county of <HI>Essex.</HI></P>
<P>THE steeple was finished in 1221. The noble subterraneous church of <HI>St. Faith, Ecclesia Sanctae Fidis in cryptis,</HI> was begun in 1257. It was supported by three rows of massy clustered pillars, with ribs diverging from them to support the solemn roof. This was the parish church. This undercroft, as these sort of build∣ings were called, had in it several chauntries and monuments. <HI>Henry Lacie,</HI> earl of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> who died in 1312, made what was called the <HI>New Work,</HI> at the east end, in which was the chapel of our Lady, and that of <HI>St. Dunstan.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAPTER-HOUSE.</NOTE>THE Chapter-house was adjoining to the south transept, was circular, and supported by four central pillars, and of more elegant <HI>gothic</HI> than the rest of the building.

<P>THIS cloister, the dance, and innumerable fine monuments (for here were crowded by far the most superb) fell victims to the sacrilege of the protector <HI>Somerset,</HI> who demolished the whole, and carried the materials to his palace then erecting in the <HI>Strand.</HI></P>
<P>FARTHER to the west, adjoining to this south side, was the parish church of <HI>St. Gregory.</HI> Over it was one of the towers which ornamented the western front. It was called the <HI>Lollards Tower,</HI> and was the bishop's prison for the heterodox, in which was com∣mitted many a midnight murder. That of <HI>Richard Hunn,</HI> in 1514, was one most foul; he was committed there; he was hanged there by the contrivance of the chancellor of the diocese, <HI>Horsey;</HI> he was scandalized with suicide; his corpse was ignomi∣niously buried. The murder came out; the coroner's inquest sat on the ashes, and they brought in a verdict of <HI>wilful murder</HI> against <HI>Horsey</HI> and his accomplices. The bishop, <HI>Fitzjames,</HI> de∣fended them. The king interfered, and ordered the murderers to make restitution to the children of the deceased, to the amount of fifteen hundred pounds. Yet the perpetrators of this villainy escaped with a pardon, notwithstanding the king, in his order,

speaks to them as having commited what himself styles the cruel murder <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Fox</HI>'s Martyrs, ii. 8 to 14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE last person confined here was <HI>Peter Burchet</HI> of the <HI>Temple,</HI> who, in 1573, desperately wounded our famous seaman Sir <HI>Richard Hawkins,</HI> in the open street, whom he had mistaken for Sir <HI>Chris∣topher Hatton.</HI> He was committed to this prison, and afterwards removed to the <HI>Tower;</HI> he there barbarously murdered <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Stow,</HI> 690.—<HI>Kennet,</HI> ii. 449.</NOTE> one of his keepers; he was tried, convicted, had his right hand struck off, and then hanged.

<P>THE style of the antient cathedral was a most beautiful <HI>gothic;</HI> over the east end was a most elegant circular window; alterations were made in the ends of the two transepts, so that their form is not delivered down to us in the antient plans; from the central tower rose a lofty and most graceful spire.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">DIMENSIONS OF THE CHURCH.</NOTE>THE dimensions of this noble temple, as taken in 1309, were these: the length six hundred and ninety feet; the breadth a hun∣dred and twenty; the height of the roof of the west part, from the floor, one hundred and two; of the east part, a hundred and eighty-eight; of the tower, two hundred and sixty; of the spire, which was made of wood covered with lead, two hundred and seventy-four.

<P>WE may be astonished at this amazing building, and naturally
<PB N="333" REF="359"/>
enquire what fund could supply money to support so vast an ex∣pence. But monarchs resigned their revenues resulting from the customs due for the materials, which were brought to the adjacent wharfs; they furnished wood from the royal forests: prelates gave up much of their revenues; and, what was more than all, by the pious bait of indulgences, and remissions of penance, brought in, from the good people of this realm, most amazing sums. Pope <HI>Innocent</HI> III. in 1252, gave a release of sixty days penance: the archbishop of <HI>Cologne</HI> gave, a few years before, a relaxation of fifty days: <HI>Boniface,</HI> archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> forty days.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">PAUL'S CROSS.</NOTE>BEFORE this cathedral was the famous <HI>Paul's Cross,</HI> a pul∣pit formed of wood, mounted upon steps of stone, and co∣vered with lead, in which the most eminent divines were ap∣pointed to preach every <HI>Sunday</HI> in the forenoon. To this place, the court, the mayor, and aldermen, and principal citizens, used to resort. The greatest part of the congregation sat in the open air; the king and his train had covered galleries; and the better sort of people, if I may judge from the old prints, were also pro∣tected from the injury of the weather; but the far greater part stood exposed in the open air: for which reason the preacher went, in very bad weather,<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE SHROWDS.</NOTE> to a place called the <HI>Shrowds;</HI> a covered space on the side of the church, to protect the congregation in inclement seasons. Considerable contributions were raised among the nobility and citizens, to support such preachers as were (as was often the case) called to town from either of the universities. In particular, the lord mayor and aldermen ordered that every preacher, who came from a distance, should be freely accommo∣dated, during five days, with sweet and convenient lodgings, fire, candle, and all necessaries. And notice was given by the bishop
<PB N="343" REF="369"/>
of <HI>London,</HI> to the preacher appointed by him, of the place he was to repair to.</P>
<P>THE origin of the custom of preaching at crosses, was proba∣bly accidental. The sanctity of this species of pillar often caused a great resort of people, to pay their devotion to the great object of their erection. A preacher, seeing a large concourse, might be seized by a sudden impulse, ascend the steps, and deliver out his pious advice from a station so fit to inspire attention, and so con∣veniently formed for the purpose. The example might be fol∣lowed, till the practice became established by custom.</P>
<P>IT certainly at first was a common cross, and coeval with the church. When it was first covered, and converted into a pulpit-cross, we are not informed. We are given to understand that it was overthrown by an earthquake in 1382, and that <HI>William Courtney,</HI> then archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> collected great sums for the rebuilding; which, says dean <HI>Nowel,</HI> in a sermon he preached at this cross, he applied to his own use. <HI>Courtney</HI> was a most munificent prelate, and not likely to abuse the charity of his flock; yet it was not rebuilt till the time of <HI>Thomas Kemp,</HI> elected bishop of <HI>London</HI> in 1449, who finished it in the form, says <HI>God∣win,</HI> in which we see it at present <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Praesul. Angl.</HI> 248.—<HI>Godwin</HI> published his book in 1616.</NOTE>; and so it stood till it was demolished, in 1643, by order of parlement, executed by the willing hands of <HI>Isaac Pennington,</HI> the fanatical lord mayor of that year, who died in the Tower, a convicted regicide.</P>
<P>WE hear of this being in use as early as the year 1259. It was used not only for the instruction of mankind, by the doctrine of the preacher, but for every purpose political or ecclesiastical: for
<PB N="344" REF="370"/>
giving force to oaths, for promulging of laws, or rather the royal pleasure, for the emission of papal bulls, for anathematizing sin∣ners, for benedictions, for exposing of penitents under censure of the church, for recantations, for the private ends of the ambi∣tious, and for the defaming of those who had incurred the displea∣sure of crowned heads.</P>
<P>IN 1259, <HI>Henry</HI> III. commanded the lord mayor to swear, be∣fore the aldermen, every person of twelve years and upwards, to be true to him and his heirs.</P>
<P>IN 1262, the same monarch caused the bull of <HI>Urban</HI> IV. to be here made public, as an absolution of him and his adherents, who had sworn to observe the <HI>Oxford</HI> provisions, made in the vio∣lent meeting at that city in 1258, called the <HI>mad</HI> parliament.</P>
<P>HERE, in 1299, <HI>Ralph de Baldoc,</HI> dean of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s, cursed all those who had searched, in the church of <HI>St. Martin in the Fields,</HI> for a hoard of gold, &amp;c.</P>

The last who appeared, was a seminary priest, who, in 1593, made his recantation. In 1537, Sir <HI>Thomas Newman,</HI> priest, bore the faggot here on a singular occasion, for singing mass with good ale.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">JAMES I.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">SPIRE OF THE CHURCH BURNT.</NOTE>I WILL not mention the different misfortunes this cathedral ex∣perienced, except the last, previous to its final destruction by the great fire. In 1561, the noble spire was totally burnt by light∣ning,

<P>IN consequence of the resolutions taken in 1620, by <HI>James</HI> I. to repair the cathedral, the celebrated <HI>Inigo Jones</HI> was appointed to the work. But it was not attempted till the year 1633, when <HI>Laud</HI> laid the first stone, and <HI>Inigo</HI> the fourth.

The great fire made way for the restoring of this magnificent pile by Sir CHRISTOPHER WREN, an architect worthy of so great a design. I will not at∣tempt to describe so well-known a building; the description is well done in several books easy to be had <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>London</HI> and its Environs described, in six vols. 8vo. 1761—Stranger's Guide through <HI>London,</HI> duod. 1786—Besides the larger works, such as, <HI>Wren's Pa∣rentalia—Maitland's London—Strype</HI>'s edition of <HI>Stow,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE>. Sir <HI>Christopher</HI> made a model in wood of his first conception for rebuilding this church, in the <HI>Roman</HI> style. He had in it an eye to the loss of the <HI>Pulpit-cross,</HI> and had supplied its place by a magnificent auditory within, for the reception of a large congregation. This was approved by men of excellent judgment, but laid aside un∣der the notion it had not sufficiently a temple-like form. A se∣cond was made, selected out of various sketches he had drawn; on this design Sir <HI>Christopher</HI> set a high value: but this also was
<PB N="352" REF="378"/>
rejected <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Parentalia,</HI> 282.</NOTE>. The third, which produced the present noble pile, was approved and executed. A singular accident happened at the beginning: while the great architect was setting out the dimen∣sions of the dome, he ordered a common laborer to bring him a flat stone, to be laid as a direction to the masons; he brought a fragment of a gravestone, on which was the word RESURGAM. This was not lost on <HI>Sir Christopher;</HI> he caught the idea of the Phoenix, which he placed on the south <HI>Portico,</HI> with that word cut beneath.</P>
<P>THE first stone was laid on <HI>June</HI> 21, 1675; and the building was completed by him in 1710 <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The same, 292.</NOTE>; but the whole decorations were not finished till 1723 <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Maitland,</HI> ii.</NOTE>. It was a most singular circumstance, that, notwithstanding it was thirty-five years in building, it was begun and finished by one architect, and under one prelate, <HI>Henry Comp∣ton,</HI> bishop of <HI>London.</HI> The church of St. <HI>Peter's</HI> was a hun∣dred and thirty-five years in building, in the reigns of nineteen popes, and went through the hands of twelve architects. It is not, as often mistaken, built after the model of that famous tem∣ple: it is the entire conception of our great countryman; and has been preferred in some respects, by a judicious writer, to even the <HI>Roman Basilica.</HI> Its dimensions are less. The compara∣tive view is given in the <HI>Parentalia,</HI> and copied in <HI>London and its Environs.</HI>—I will only mention the great outlines:—the height of <HI>St. Peter's,</HI> to the top of the cross, is four hundred and thirty-seven feet and a half; that of <HI>St. Paul's,</HI> three hundred and forty feet: so that, from its situation, it is lofty enough to be seen
<PB N="353" REF="379"/>
from the sea. The length of the first, is seven hundred and twenty-nine feet; of the latter, five hundred. The greatest breadth of St. <HI>Peter's</HI> is three hundred and sixty-four; of St. <HI>Paul's,</HI> one hundred and eighty.</P>
<P>IN the reigns of <HI>James</HI> I. and <HI>Charles</HI> I. the body of this ca∣thedral was the common resort of the politicians, the news-mon∣gers, and idle in general.

<P>IN digging the foundation for the rebuilding of this cathedral, it was discovered, beneath the graves mentioned at p. 9, that the foundation of the old church rested on a layer of hard and close pot earth. Curiosity led Sir <HI>Christopher Wren</HI> to search farther. He found that on the north side it was six feet thick, that it grew thinner towards the south, and on the decline of the hill was
<PB N="356" REF="382"/>
scarcely four. On advancing farther, he met with nothing but loose sand; at length he came to water and sand mixed with periwinkles, and other sea-shells; and, by boring, came at last to the beach, and under that the natural hard clay: which evinced that the sea had once occupied the space on which St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s now stands. This sand had been one of those sand-hills frequent on many coasts, not only on those of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> but on our own. It was the opinion of our great architect, that all the space between <HI>Camberwell</HI> hill and the hills of <HI>Essex</HI> had been a vast bay, at low-water a sandy plain. All which appears in some distant age to have been embanked, possibly by the <HI>Ro∣mans</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Parentalia,</HI> p. 285.</NOTE>, who were greatly employed in that useful work, <HI>paludibus emuniendis.</HI></P>
<P>TO the south of this cathedral are the college of Civilians, or Doctors commons, the court of arches, the court of delegates, and several others, the great satellites of the church. The court of <HI>arches</HI> took its name, <HI>curia de arcubus,</HI> from having been once kept in <HI>Bow church, Cheapside.</HI> With the downfall of the church of <HI>Rome</HI> their powers decreased, and continued decreasing as the rights of mankind became better understood.</P>

<Q>of a most beauti∣ful frame of faire houses and shops than be within the walls of <HI>London</HI> or elsewhere in <HI>England,</HI> commonly called <HI>Goldsmiths-Row;</HI> builded by <HI>Thomas Wood,</HI> goldsmith, and one of the sheriffes of <HI>London</HI> in 1491.

The words <HI>Fontes Fodinae</HI> are painted on the picture, to imply his double attentions. The wealth he got in the mines was totally exhausted in the execution of his project, of which the metropolis, to this moment, receives increas∣ing benefit. Sir <HI>Hugh</HI> left a share in the New River to this com∣pany, for the benefit of the decayed members; which, <HI>even</HI> in 1704, amounted to £. 134.</P>

<P><PB N="360" REF="386"/>ST. <HI>Dunstan</HI> appears here in canvas, in a rich robe, and with his crosier. The unfortunate devil is not forgotten, roaring between the pincers of the saint; with the heavenly host above, applauding the deed. It seems by this that St. <HI>Dunstan</HI> amused himself in works of gold as well as iron: so that it is no wonder to see the evil spirit in a place where the <HI>irritamenta malorum</HI> so much abound.</P>
<P>QUEEN <HI>Elizabeth</HI> presented this company with a silver cup, out of which annual libations are made to her memory. She was particularly kind to the citizens, and borrowed money of them on all occasions. The goldsmiths must of course enjoy a distin∣guished place in her esteem.</P>
<P>THIS company appeared as a fraternity as early as 1180, being then amerced for being <HI>adulterine,</HI> or for setting up without the king's licence. In the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> III. they obtained a pa∣tent, and were incorporated for the sum of ten marks. <HI>Richard</HI> II. confirmed the same, in consideration of the sum of twenty marks. They increased in wealth, and have left evident marks of charity, by having above a thousand pounds a year to dispose of for bene∣volent purposes. They became in time the bankers of the capi∣tal. The <HI>Lombards</HI> were the first and the greatest, and most of the money contracts in old times passed through their hands. Many of our monarchs were obliged to them for money. They did not seem to like trusting <HI>Henry</HI> IV. on his bond, so took the customs in pawn for their loan.</P>
<P>THE business of goldsmiths was confined to the buying and selling of plate, and foreign coins of gold and silver, melting them, and coining others at the mint. The banking was accidental, and foreign to their institution.</P>
<P><PB N="361" REF="387"/>REGULAR banking by private people resulted, in 1643, from the calamity of the time, when the seditious spirit was incited by the arts of the parlementary leaders. The merchants and trades∣men, who before trusted their cash to their servants and appren∣tices, found that no longer safe; neither did they dare to leave it in the mint at the Tower, by reason of the distresses of majesty itself, which before was a place of public deposit. In the year 1645, they began to place it in the hands of goldsmiths, when they first began publicly to exercise both professions. Even in my days were several very eminent bankers, who kept the gold∣smiths shop: but they were more frequently separated. The first regular banker was Mr. <HI>Francis Child,</HI> goldsmith, who began business soon after the Restoration. He was the father of the profession, a person of large fortune and most respectable character. He married, between the years 1665 and 1675, <HI>Mar∣tha,</HI> only daughter of <HI>Robert Blanchard,</HI> citizen and goldsmith, by whom he had twelve children. Mr. <HI>Child</HI> was afterwards knighted. He lived in <HI>Fleet-street,</HI> where the shop still continues <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For these particulars I am obliged to the civility of Mr. <HI>Dent,</HI> partner in this great shop.</NOTE>, in a state of the highest respectability. Mr. <HI>Granger</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vol. iii. 410.</NOTE> mentions Mr. <HI>Child</HI> as successor to the shop of alderman <HI>Backwel,</HI> a banker in the time of <HI>Charles</HI> II. noted for his integrity, abilities, and industry; who was ruined by the shutting up of the exchequer in 1672. His books were placed in the hands of Mr. <HI>Child,</HI> and still remain in the family.</P>

It was governed by a dean, and had a number of secular canons. Succeeding monarchs confirmed all its privileges.

It had also from the beginning the dreadful privilege of sanctuary, which was the cause of its being the resort of every species of profligates, from the murderer to the pick-pocket; and was most tenaciously vindi∣cated by its holy rulers. In 1439 soldier, who for some crime

was conducted from <HI>Newgate</HI> towards <HI>Guild-hall,</HI> was rescued by five fellows who rushed out of <HI>Panyer-alley,</HI> and who fled with him into the adjacent sanctuary.

The dean and chapter complained of this breach of privilege: the cause was heard, and the sheriffs were obliged to deliver the men into the sanctuary.

<P>A MAGNIFICENT church was erected within this jurisdiction, which was continued till the college was surrendered, in 1548, when it was pulled down, and a great tavern erected in the place.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHEAPSIDE.</NOTE>THE view we have of <HI>Cheapside,</HI> as it appeared just before the great fire, shews that it was spacious and beautiful.

This shews the antient forms of building our more magnificent streets. On the south side stands the church of St. <HI>Mary le Bow,</HI> or <HI>de arcubus,</HI> because it originally was built upon arches. It perished in 1666, and was rebuilt after a design of Sir <HI>Christopher Wren</HI>'s.

<P>JOHN COVENTRY, son of <HI>William Coventry,</HI> of the city of that name, was an opulent mercer of the city of <HI>London,</HI> and mayor in 1425; a most spirited magistrate, who dared to interfere in the dreadful quarrel between <HI>Humphrey</HI> duke of <HI>Glocester</HI> and the insolent cardinal <HI>Beaufort,</HI> which he successfully quelled, from his loins is descended the present earl of <HI>Coventry.</HI></P>

He was descended from an ancestor of one of the above-mentioned names, who filled the praetorian chair of <HI>London</HI> in the years 1347 and 1354, having, by his industry in the trade of a skinner, attained to great wealth.</P>
<P>SIR GEFFRY BULLEN, mayor in 1458, was grandfather to <HI>Thomas</HI> earl of <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> father of <HI>Anna Bullen,</HI> and grandfather to queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> the highest genealogical honor the city ever possessed.</P>
<P>SIR BAPTIST HICKS was a great mercer at the accession of <HI>James</HI> I. and made a vast fortune by supplying the court with silks.

<P>THE <HI>Capels,</HI> earls of <HI>Essex,</HI> are descended from Sir <HI>William Capel, draper,</HI> mayor in 1503. He first set up a cage in every ward, for the punishment of idle people.</P>

<P>THE old church of <HI>Bow</HI> was founded in the time of <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror; we have before given the origin of the name, which was from the arches of the foundation, not of the steeple, which was rebuilt with arches, or in a crown fashion, but not till long after the year 1512 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Newcourt</HI>'s <HI>Repertorium,</HI> i. 437.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">STORY OF FITZ-OSBERT.</NOTE> In this tower, in 1196, one <HI>William Fitz-Os∣bert,</HI> alias <HI>Long Beard,</HI> a seditious fellow of uncommon eloquence, but of the lowest rank, set up as advocate for the poorer citizens against the oppressions of the rich. He took opportunity of be∣ginning a tumult by inflaming their minds against a certain tax, raised entirely for the necessities of the state. Many lives were lost on the occasion, at St. <HI>Paul's. Hubert,</HI> the great justiciary, summoned <HI>Long Beard</HI> to appear before him; but found him so well supported, that he thought it prudent to forbear punishment. This served but to increase his insolence. He grew so outrageous, that the citizens were resolved to bring him to justice: a resolute band made the attempt, when he and a few desperate fellows fled to the tower of <HI>Bow</HI> steeple, which they fortified. The besiegers, seeing the mob assemble from all parts to his rescue, made a fire
<PB N="367" REF="393"/>
at the bottom, which forced him and his companions to sally out; but they were taken, and the next day he and eight more were dragged by their heels to the <HI>Elms</HI> at <HI>Smithfield,</HI> and there hanged. It was said, that finding himself deserted by Heaven, he at the gallows
<Q>forsook <HI>Mary</HI>'s Son (as he called our SAVIOUR), and called upon the <HI>Devil</HI> to helpe and deliver him.</Q>
Yet, not∣withstanding this, a cunning priest, a relation of his, stole his body, and pretended many miracles were wrought at the place of execution; and many persons passed the night on the spot which deprived them of a <HI>martyr,</HI> who died supporting the majesty of the people, as <HI>Thomas Becket</HI> did that of the pope.</P>
<P>IN the middle of the street, a little to the west of the church,<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>S.</NOTE> stood the cross and the conduit. The first was one of the affec∣tionate tokens of <HI>Edward</HI> I. towards his queen <HI>Elinor,</HI> built where her body rested in its way to interment, in 1290. It had origi∣nally the statue of the queen, and in all respects resembling that at <HI>Northampton;</HI> at length, falling to decay, it was rebuilt, in 1441, by <HI>John Hutherby,</HI> mayor of the city, at the expence of several of the citizens. It was ornamented with various images, such as that of the Resurrection, of the <HI>Virgin,</HI> of <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor, and the like. At every public entry it was new gilt, for the magni∣ficent processions took this road. After the Reformation, the images gave much offence; the goddess <HI>Diana</HI> was substituted instead of the <HI>Virgin,</HI> after the symbols of superstition had been frequently mutilated. Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> disapproved of those at∣tacks on the remnants of the old religion, and offered a large re∣ward for the discovery of the offenders. She thought that a plain cross, the mark of the religion of the country, ought not to be the occasion of any scandal; so directed that one should be placed
<PB N="368" REF="394"/>
on the summit, and gilt <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stow's Survaie, <HI>485.</HI></NOTE>. Superstition is certain, in course of time, to take the other extreme. In the year 1643, the parlement voted the taking down of all crosses, and the demolishing of all popish paintings, &amp;c. The destruction of this cross was com∣mitted to Sir <HI>Robert Harlow;</HI> who went on the service with true zeal, attended by a troop of horse and two companies of foot, and executed his orders most effectually. The same most <HI>pious</HI> and <HI>religious noble</HI> knight did also attack and demolish "the abomi∣nable and <HI>most blasphemous</HI> crucifix" in <HI>Christ</HI>'s hospital, and broke it into a thousand pieces <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vicar's Parliamentary Chron.</HI> 1646, p. 290.</NOTE>. In short, such was the rage of the times against the sign of our religion, that it was not suffered in shop-books, or even in the primers of children <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gray's Hudibras,</HI> ii. 233, note.—Consult also the note to <HI>L'Hist. de l'Entrèe de la Reyne Mere,</HI> printed for <HI>W.

<P>THE <HI>Nag's-head</HI> tavern, almost opposite to the cross, was the fictitious scene of consecration of the Protestant bishops, at the accession of queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> in 1559. It was pretended by the adversaries of our religion, that a certain number of ecclesiastics, in hurry to take possession of the vacant sees, assembled here, where they were to undergo the ceremony from <HI>Anthony Kitchen,</HI> alias <HI>Dustan,</HI> bishop of <HI>Llandaff,</HI> a sort of occasional conformist, who had taken the oaths of supremacy to <HI>Elizabeth. Bonner,</HI> bi∣shop of <HI>London,</HI> (then confined in the Tower) hearing of it, sent
<PB N="369" REF="395"/>
his chaplain to <HI>Kitchen,</HI> threatening him with excommunication, in case he proceeded. On this the prelate refused to perform the ceremony: on which, say the Catholics, <HI>Parker</HI> and the other candidates, rather than defer possession of their dioceses, de∣termined to consecrate one another; which, says the story, they did without any sort of scruple, and <HI>Icorey</HI> began with <HI>Parker,</HI> who instantly rose archbishop of <HI>Canterbury.</HI> The refutation of this tale may be read in <HI>Strype</HI>'s Life of archbishop <HI>Parker,</HI> at p. 57, which makes it needless for me to enter on the attempt. A view of the tavern, and its sign, is preserved in a print in the <HI>En∣tré de la Reyne Mere du Roy,</HI> or of <HI>Mary de Medicis,</HI> when she visited our unfortunate monarch, <HI>Charles</HI> I. and her daughter, his fair spouse.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Laurence-lane,</HI> not far from hence, was another public-house of much antiquity, and which is still in great business as a car∣riers inn; the <HI>Blossoms Inn,</HI> so named from the rich border of flowers which adorned the original sign, that of St. <HI>Laurence.</HI> These were the effects of his martyrdom, "for (says the legend) flowers sprung up on the spot of his cruel martyrdom."</P>
<P>IN this street, between the cross and <HI>Sopers-lane,</HI> were held most splendid tournaments in the year 1331; they began <HI>Sept.</HI> 21, and lasted three days. A scaffold was erected for queen <HI>Philippa</HI> and her gay troop of ladies, all most richly attired, to behold the knights collected from all quarters to shew their skill in deeds of arms. The upper part of the scaffold, on which the ladies were seated, "brake in sunder, and," as <HI>Stow</HI> says,
<Q>whereby they were (with some shame) forced to fall downe;</Q>
and many knights and others, which stood beneath, much hurt. The car∣penters were saved from punishment, by the intercession of the
<PB N="370" REF="396"/>
queen; but, to prevent such accidents in future, the king ordered a building of stone to be erected, near the church of St. <HI>Mary le Bow,</HI> for himself, the queen, and "other states," to see the gallant spectacles in safety <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stow's Survaie, <HI>485.</HI></NOTE>. This was used long after for the same pur∣pose, even till the year 1410, when <HI>Henry</HI> IV. granted it to cer∣tain mercers, who converted it into shops, warehouses, and other requisites of their trade <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The same, 467.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">CONDUIT.</NOTE>A LITTLE to the east of the cross stood the conduit, which served as the mother or chief aqueduct, which was to serve the lesser conduits with water, brought by pipes from <HI>Paddington.</HI> This stood on the site of the old conduit, founded in 1285, castel∣lated with stone, and cisterned in lead, as <HI>old Stow</HI> tells us; and again rebuilt in 1479, by <HI>Thomas Ilan,</HI> one of the sheriffs. On some very festive occasions these conduits have been made to run with claret. Such was the case at the coronation of <HI>Anna Bullen;</HI> who was received at the lesser conduit by <HI>Pallas, Juno,</HI> and <HI>Venus. Mercury,</HI> in the name of the goddesses, presented to her a ball of gold divided into three parts, signifying three gifts bestowed on her by the deities, WISDOM, RICHES, and FELICITY. But, alas! beneath them lurked speedy disgrace, imprisonment, the block, and axe.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">THE STANDARD.</NOTE>I CANNOT well fix the place where the old Standard in <HI>Cheap</HI> stood. The time of its foundation is unknown. It appears to have been very ruinous in 1442, at which time <HI>Henry</HI> VI. granted a licence for the repairing of it, together with a conduit in the same. This was a place at which executions, and other acts of justice,
<PB N="371" REF="397"/>
were in old times frequently performed. Here, in 1293,<NOTE PLACE="marg">EXECUTIONS AT THE STANDARD.</NOTE> three men had their heads cut off, for rescuing a prisoner arrested by a city officer. In 1351, two fishmongers were beheaded at the standard, but their crime has not reached us. In 1461, <HI>John Davy</HI> had his hand struck off, for striking a man before the judges at <HI>Westminster;</HI> and in 1399, <HI>Henry</HI> IV. caused the blank char∣ters, made by <HI>Richard</HI> II. to be burned here, as we do libels in our times.</P>
<P>BUT these were legal acts. Many sad instances of barbarous executions were done in the fury of popular commotions. <HI>Rich∣ard Lions,</HI> an eminent goldsmith, and late sheriff of the city, was in 1381 (with several others) cruelly beheaded here by order of <HI>Wat Tyler. Lions</HI> was interred in the church of St. <HI>James, Garlic-hith,</HI> and on his tomb (now lost) was his figure in a long flowered gown, a large purse hanging in a belt from his shoul∣ders, his hair short, his beard forked, a plain hood falling back and covering his shoulders. At the same time numbers of fo∣reign merchants, especially <HI>Flemings,</HI> were dragged from the churches, and, the <HI>Shibboleth</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Judges,</HI> chap. xii. ver. 6.</NOTE> of <HI>Bread</HI> and <HI>Cheese</HI> being put to them (which they pronouncing <HI>Brot</HI> and <HI>Cawse</HI>) they were in∣stantly put to death. In 1450, lord <HI>Say,</HI> high treasurer of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> lost his head at the Standard, by the brutality of <HI>John Cade.

<P>WHETHER <HI>Walter Stapleton,</HI> bishop of <HI>Exeter,</HI> suffered by the popular fury <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Page of this Work.</NOTE> on this spot, is rather uncertain; some imagine

<P>THROUGH this street, and probably to this cross, in 1439, walked barefooted, with a tap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r in her hand, <HI>Elinor Cobham,</HI> wise to <HI>Humphrey</HI> duke of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> charged with the crime of sorcery, with intending the death of the king by melting an image of wax, with which his body was to sympathize.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">GUILDHALL.</NOTE>THE <HI>Guildhall</HI> of this vast city stands at the end of a street running northward from <HI>Cheapside.</HI> Before the year 1411, the court-hall, or <HI>Bury,</HI> as it was called, was held at <HI>Aldermans bury,</HI> so denominated from their meeting there. <HI>Stow</HI> remembered its ruins, and says, that in his days it was used as <HI>Carpenters-hall.</HI> It was succeeded by a new one, begun in 1411, and finished in twenty years, by voluntary contributions, by sums raised for par∣dons of offences, and by fines. Its <HI>gothic</HI> front terminates the end of <HI>King-street.</HI> Its length is a hundred and fifty-three feet; its breadth forty-eight; its height fifty-five; so that it is capable of holding thousands of people. Elections, and every species of city business, is transacted here.</P>
<P><PB N="373" REF="399"/>WITHIN are portraits of numbers of our judges, who frequently try causes under this roof. I must direct the reader's attention to twelve of that order of peculiar merit: these are the portraits of the able and virtuous Sir MATTHEW HALE, and his eleven cotemporary judges; who, after the dreadful calamity of 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>66, regulated the rebuilding of the city of <HI>London</HI> by such wise rules, as to prevent the endless train of vexatious law-suits which might ensue; and been little less chargeable than the fire itself had been. This was principally owing to Sir <HI>Matthew Hale,</HI> who con∣ducted the business; and sat with his brethren in <HI>Clifford</HI>'s <HI>Inn,</HI> to compose all differences between landlord and tenant. These portraits were painted by <HI>Michael Wright,</HI> a good painter in the time of <HI>Charles</HI> II. and <HI>James</HI> II. and who died in the year 1700. It was designed that Sir <HI>Peter Lely</HI> should draw these pictures, but he fastidiously refused to wait on the judges at their cham∣bers. <HI>Wright</HI> received sixty pounds apiece for his work <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Anecdotes of Painting, iii. 40.</NOTE>. In the year 1779, they were found to be in so bad a condition, as to make it an even question with the committee of city lands, whe∣ther they should be continued in their places, or committed to the flames. To the eternal honor of alderman <HI>Townsend,</HI> his vote decided in favor of their preservation <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>London's Gratitude,</HI> &amp;c. 19.</NOTE>.

merit: but in how many places do we meet instances of a tem∣porary idolatry, the phrenzy of the day! Statues and portraits appear, to the astonishment of posterity, purged from the preju∣dices of the time.</P>
<Q><L>The things themselves are neither scarce nor rare;</L>
<L>The wonder's, how the devil they got there!</L></Q>
<P>FACING the entrance are two tremendous figures, by some named <HI>Gog</HI> and <HI>Magog;</HI> by <HI>Stow,</HI> an antient <HI>Briton</HI> and <HI>Saxon.</HI> I leave to others the important decision. At the bottom of the room is a marble group, of good workmanship, (with <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Commerce</HI> whimpering like two marred children), executed soon after the year 1770, by Mr. BACON. The principal figure was also a giant, in his day, the raw-head and bloody-bones to the good folks at St. <HI>James</HI>'s; which, while remon∣strances were in fashion, annually haunted the court in terrific forms. The eloquence dashed in the face of majesty, alas! proved in vain. The spectre was there condemned to silence; but his patriotism may be read by his admiring fellow-citizens, as long as the melancholy marble can retain the tale of the affrighted times.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">GREAT FEASTS.</NOTE>THE first time that this hall was used on festive occasions, was by Sir <HI>John Shaw,</HI> goldsmith, knighted in the field of <HI>Bosworth.</HI> After building the essentials of good kitchens and other offices, in the year 1500 he gave here the mayor's feast, which before had usually been done in <HI>Grocers-hall.</HI> None of their bills of fare have reached me, but doubtlessly they were very magnifi∣cent. They at length grew to such excess, that, in the time of <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> a sumptuary law was made to restrain the ex∣pence
<PB N="375" REF="401"/>
both of provisions and liveries: but I suspect, as it lessened the honor of the city, it was not long observed; for in 1554, the city thought proper to renew the order of council, by way of reminding their fellow-citizens of their relapse into luxury. Among the great feasts given here on public occasions, may be reckoned that given in 1612, on occasion of the unhappy marriage of the prince <HI>Palatine</HI> with <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> daughter of <HI>James</HI> I; who, in defiance of the remonstrances of his better-judging father-in-law, rushed on the usurpation of the domi∣nion of another monarch, and brought great misery on himself and his amiable spouse. The next was in 1641, when <HI>Charles</HI> I. returned from his imprudent, inefficacious journey into <HI>Scotland.</HI> In the midst of the most factious and turbulent times, when every engine was set to work to annihilate the regal power, the city, un∣der its lord mayor, Sir <HI>William Acton,</HI> made a feast unparalleled in history for its magnificence.

<P>THESE <HI>Sotelties,</HI> or Subtilities as they were called, were the ornamental part of the desert, and were extremely different from those in present use. In the inthronization feast of archbishop <HI>Wareham,</HI> on <HI>March</HI> 9th, 1504, the first course was preceded by
<Q>a <HI>warner</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A <HI>warner</HI> was the first soteltie, and which preceded or gave warning of the courses. See <HI>Leland's Collect.</HI> vi. 21.</NOTE>, conveyed upon a rounde boorde of viii panes, with viii towres embatteled and made with flowres, stand∣ynge on every towre a bedil in his habite, with his staffe: and in the same boorde, first the king syttinge in his parliament, with his lordes about hym in their robes; and Saint <HI>Wylliam,</HI> lyke an archishop, sytting on the ryght hand of the kyng: then the chaunceler of <HI>Oxforde,</HI> with other doctors about hym, presented the said lord <HI>Wylliam,</HI> kneelyng, in a doctor's habite, unto the kyng, with his commend of vertue and cunnynge, &amp;c. &amp;c. And on the third boorde of the same warner, the Holy Ghoste appeared with bryght beames proceedyng from hym of the gyftes of grace towarde the sayde lorde of the feaste.</Q>
This is a specimen of the antient sotelties. This was a <HI>Lenten</HI> feast of the most luxurious kind. Many of the so∣telties were suited to the occasion, and of the legendary nature; others historical; but all, without doubt, contrived "with great cunnynge."</P>
<P>TO these scenes of luxury and gluttony, let me oppose the simple fare at a feast of the <HI>Wax-chandlers,</HI> on <HI>Oct.</HI> 28th, 1478. These were a flourishing company in the days of old, when gra∣titude
<PB N="382" REF="408"/>
to saints called so frequently for lights. How many thou∣sands of wax candles were consumed on those occasions, and what quantities the expiatory offerings of private persons, none can enumerate. <HI>Candle-mass</HI> day wasted its thousands, and those all blessed by the priests, and adjured in solemn terms.
<Q>I ad∣jure thee, O waxen creature, that thou repel the devil and his sprights, &amp;c. &amp;c <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. Mr. <HI>Brand</HI>'s edit. of <HI>Bourne</HI>'s <HI>Antiquitates Vulgares,</HI> p. 222.</NOTE>.</Q>
Certainly this company, which was in∣corporated in 1484, might have afforded a more delicate feast than

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">GUILDHALL CHAPEL.</NOTE>ADJACENT to <HI>Guildhall,</HI> is <HI>Guildhall</HI> chapel, or college, a <HI>go∣thic</HI> building, founded by <HI>Peter Fanlore, Adam Francis,</HI> and <HI>Henry Frowick,</HI> citizens, about the year 1299. The establishment was
<PB N="383" REF="409"/>
a warden, seven priests, three clerks, and four choristers. <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> VI. granted it to the mayor and commonalty of the city of <HI>London</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tanner</HI> and <HI>Newcourt,</HI> i. 363.</NOTE>. Here used to be service once a week, and also at the election of the mayor, and before the mayor's feast, to deprecate indigestions, and all plethoric evils <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Newcourt,</HI> i. 364.</NOTE>. At present divine service is discontinued here, the chapel being used as a justice room.</P>
<P>ADJOINING to it once stood a fair library,<NOTE PLACE="marg">LIBRARY.</NOTE> furnished with books belonging to <HI>Guildhall,</HI> built by the executors of the famous <HI>Whittington. Stow</HI> says that the protector <HI>Somerset</HI> sent to borrow some of the books, with a promise of restoring them; three <HI>Curries</HI> were laden with them, but they never more were returned <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Stow</HI>'s <HI>Survaie,</HI> 493.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IMMEDIATELY beyond the chapel stands <HI>Blackwall's hall,</HI> or,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BLACKWALL'S HALL.</NOTE> more properly, <HI>Bakewell,</HI> from its having in later years been in∣habited by a person of that name. It was originally called <HI>Ba∣sing's haugh,</HI> or hall, from a family of that name; the coats of arms of which were to be seen cut in stone, or painted, in the an∣tient building. It was on vaults of stone brought from <HI>Caen</HI> in <HI>Normandy;</HI> the time is uncertain, but certainly after the Con∣quest. The family were of great antiquity. <HI>Solomon Basing</HI> was mayor in 1216; and another of the name sheriff in 1308. In 1397 the house was purchased by the mayor and commonalty for fifty pounds, and from that time has been used as the market of woollen cloth. It grew so ruinous in the time of queen <HI>Eliza∣beth,</HI> that it was pulled down, and rebuilt at the expence of twenty-five hundred pounds; much of it at the expence of <HI>Rich∣ard
<PB N="384" REF="410"/>
May,</HI> merchant-taylor. It consists at present of two large courts, with warehouses in all parts for the lodging of the cloth; but is very little used. Formerly there were proclamations issued to compel people to bring their goods into this hall, to prevent deceit in the manufactures, which might bring on us discredit in foreign markets, and also be the means of defrauding the poor children of <HI>Christ hospital</HI> of part of the revenue which arose from the <HI>hallage</HI> of this great magazine.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">HOSPITAL OF ST. THOMAS OF ACON;</NOTE>ON the north side of <HI>Cheapside</HI> stood the hospital of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> of <HI>Acon,</HI> founded by <HI>Thomas Fitz-Theobald de Helles</HI> and his wife <HI>Agnes,</HI> sister to the turbulent <HI>Thomas Becket,</HI> who was born in the house of his father <HI>Gilbert,</HI> situated on this spot. The mother of our meek saint was a fair <HI>Saracen,</HI> whom his father had married in the <HI>Holy Land.</HI> On the site of his house rose the hospital, built within twenty years after the murder of <HI>Thomas;</HI> yet such was the repute of his sanctity, that it was dedicated to him, in con∣junction with the blessed Virgin, without waiting for his canoni∣zation. The hospital consisted of a master and several brethren, professing the rule of St. <HI>Austin.</HI> The church, cloisters, &amp;c. were granted by <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. to the Mercers company, who had the gift of the mastership <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tanner.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">NOW MERCER<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> HALL.</NOTE>IN the old church were numbers of monuments; among others, one to <HI>James Butler</HI> earl of <HI>Ormond,</HI> and <HI>Joan</HI> his wife, living in the beginning of the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VI. This whole pile was destroyed in the great fire, but was very handsomely re∣built by the Mercers company, who have their hall here. In the portico to the chapel is a full-length figure recumbent of <HI>Richard
<PB N="385" REF="411"/>
Fishbourn,</HI> dressed in a furred gown and a ruff; he died in 1623, and, being a great benefactor to the place, received the honor of this monument.</P>
<P>THIS company is the first of the twelve, or such who are ho∣nored with the privilege of the lord mayor's being elected out of one of them. The name by no means implied originally a dealer in silks: for <HI>mercery</HI> included all sorts of small wares, toys, and haberdashery <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Anderson's Dict.</HI> i. 145.</NOTE>. But, as numbers of this opulent company were merchants, and imported great quantities of rich silks from <HI>Italy,</HI> the name became applied to the company, and all deal∣ers in silk. Several of the portraits in the great room of this hall are of <HI>Italian</HI> merchants. Not fewer than sixty-two mayors were of this company, between the years 1214 and 1762; among which it reckons Sir <HI>John Coventry,</HI> Sir <HI>Richard Whittington,</HI> and Sir <HI>Richard</HI> and Sir <HI>John Gresham.</HI> We are obliged to the exact <HI>Strype</HI> for the list. In that by <HI>Maitland,</HI> the company each mayor was of, is omitted.</P>
<P>IMMEDIATELY to the east is the narrow street, the <HI>Old Jewry,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">THE OLD JEWRY.</NOTE> which took its name from the great synagogue which stood there till the unhappy race were expelled the kingdom, in 1291. Their persecutions, under some of the preceding monarchs, nearly equal∣led those of the Christians under the <HI>Roman</HI> emperors: yet the love of gain retained them in our country in defiance of all their suf∣ferings. A new order of friars, called <HI>Fratres de Sacca,</HI> or <HI>de pe∣nitentia,</HI> got possession of the <HI>Jewish</HI> temple: but did not hold it long. <HI>Robert Fitzwalter,</HI> the great banner-bearer of the city, requested, in 1305, that the friars might assign it to him. It
<PB N="386" REF="412"/>
seems it joined to his own house, which stood near the site of the present <HI>Grocers hall.</HI> In 1439, it was occupied by <HI>Robert Lorge,</HI> mayor, who kept his mayoralty in this house; Sir <HI>Hugh Clapton</HI> did the same in 1492; and after these tenants it was degraded into a tavern, distinguished by the sign of the Windmill.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">GROCERS HALL.</NOTE>THE chapel, or church, was bought by the Grocers company, in 1411, from <HI>Fitzwalter,</HI> for three hundred and twenty marks <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Survaie,</HI> 476, 499.</NOTE>; who here layed the foundation of the present hall, a noble room, with a <HI>gothic</HI> front, and bow window. Here, to my great sur∣prize,<NOTE PLACE="marg">O. SIR JOHN CUTLER.</NOTE> I met again with Sir <HI>John Cutler,</HI> knight, and grocer, in marble and on canvas. In the first he is represented standing, in a flowing wig waved rather than curled, a laced cravat, and a furred gown with the folds not ungraceful: in all, except where the dress is inimical to the sculptor's art, it may be called a good performance. By his portrait we may learn that this worthy wore a black wig, and was a good-looking man. He died in 1693. His kinsman and executor <HI>Edmund Boulter,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> expended £. 7,666 on his funeral expences <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Strype's Stow,</HI> i. book i. p. 289.</NOTE>. I am to learn how his statue and portrait came here. He is spoken of as a benefactor, and that he built the parlour, and over it an entertaining room. The anecdote of his bounty to the College of Physicians, may lead one to suppose that the Grocers did not meet with more liberal treatment. If not, the character given of him by Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> may rest unimpeached:
<Q><L>Thy life more wretched, <HI>Cutler,</HI> was confess'd,</L>
<L>Arise and tell me was thy death more bless'd?</L>

<L>For very want he could not build a wall.</L>

The first died before him. <HI>J. C. Brooke,</HI> <ABBR>esq</ABBR> <HI>Somerset-herald.</HI>—The same authority tells me he had his grant of arms just before his death, wherein he is styled, "of the city of <HI>Westminster.</HI>"</NOTE>;</L>

<P>THIS company follows the Mercers; they were originally called <HI>Pepperers,</HI> from their dealing so greatly in pepper: but in 1345 they were incorporated by the name of <HI>Grocers,</HI> either because they fold things by, or dealt in <HI>grossi</HI> or figs <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Survaie,</HI> 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7.</NOTE>.

<P>I FORGOT <HI>Bucklesbury,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BUCKLESBURY.</NOTE> a street which opens on the south side of <HI>Cheapside,</HI> a little to the west of the Grocers hall. It took its name from one <HI>Buckle,</HI> who had in it a large manour-house of stone. This man lost his life in a strange way. Near his house stood an old tower built by <HI>Edward</HI> I. called the <HI>Cornets</HI> tower, possibly a watch tower, from the summit of which signals might have been given by the blowing of a horn.

wood; or, according to the expression of the times, a <HI>goodly frame of timber:</HI> but in greedily demolishing this tower, a stone fell on him, and crushed him to death; and another, who married his widow, set up the new-prepared frame of timber, and finished the work.

In it stood the famous equestrian statue, erected in honor of <HI>Charles</HI> II, by his most loyal subject Sir <HI>Robert Viner,</HI> lord mayor. Fortunately his lordship discovered at a founder's, one of <HI>John Sobieski,</HI> king of <HI>Poland,</HI> trampling on a Turk; the good knight christened the <HI>Polish</HI> mo∣narch by the name of <HI>Charles,</HI> and bestowed on the turbaned <HI>Turk</HI> that of <HI>Oliver Cromwel;</HI> and thus, new named, it arose on this spot in honor of his convivial monarch.</P>

Let the pride of my country not be suppressed, when I have opportunity of saying, that the original hint was given to him by a <HI>Welshman;</HI> by <HI>Richard Clough,</HI> afterwards knighted, originally his servant, and in the year 1561, by his merit and industry, advanced by Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> to be his correspondent and agent in the then emporium of the world,
<PB N="390" REF="417"/>
<HI>Antwerp. Clough</HI> wrote to his master, to blame the city of <HI>Lon∣don</HI> for neglecting so necessary a thing; bluntly telling, that they studied nothing else but their own private profit; that they were content to walk about in the rain, more like pedlars than mer∣chants; and that there was no kind of people but had their place to transact business in, in other countries. Thus stimu∣lated, Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> purchased some tenements on the site of the Royal Exchange; and, on <HI>June</HI> 7, 1566, laid the foundation, and in <HI>November,</HI> 1567, completed what was then called the <HI>Bourse.</HI> In 1570, queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> went in great state from her palace at <HI>Somerset-house,</HI> to make Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> a visit at his own house. After dinner she went to the Bourse, visited every part, and then, by sound of trumpet, dignified it with the title of the <HI>Royal Ex∣change.</HI> All the upper part was filled then, and even to this cen∣tury, with shops; on this occasion they were filled with the richest productions of the universe, to shew her majesty the prosperity of the commercial parts of her dominions. I cannot learn what the expence of this noble design was, only that the annual product of the rents to his widow was £. 751. 5 <HI>s.</HI> I am equally unac∣quainted with the form of the original building, which perished in the great fire.

the city granaries seem at first to have been under the care of the mayors; but in <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's time, regular surveyors were ap∣pointed.

For this purpose he left three thousand marks to the Drapers company to fulfil his intent. This was never executed: but in 1466 a fraternity of sixty priests, some of whom were to perform divine service every market-day, to such who frequented the market, was founded by three priests, <HI>William Rouse, John Risby,</HI> and <HI>Thomas Ashby</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tanner.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>LEADENHALL-STREET had the good fortune to escape tolerably well in the great fire. The house was used for many other purposes; for the keeping the artillery and other arms of the city. Prepara∣tions for any triumph or pageantry in the city were made here. From its strength it was considered as the chief fortress within the city, in case of popular tumults; and also as the place from which doles, largesses, or pious alms, were to be distributed. Here, in 1546, while <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. lay putrefying in state, <HI>Heath,</HI> bishop of <HI>Winchester,</HI> his almoner, and others his ministers, distri∣buted great sums of money, during twelve days, to the poor of the city.

From that time it was hung on a range of hooks over the doors of a long row of neighbouring houses. In the third of <HI>Edward</HI> VI, when the plague of fanaticism began to scandalize the promoters of the Reformed religion, an ignorant wretch, called <HI>Sir Stephen,</HI> curate of St. <HI>Catherine Cree,</HI> began to preach against this <HI>maypole,</HI> (not∣withstanding it had hung in peace ever since the <HI>Evil May-day</HI>), as an idol, by naming the church St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> with the addition of <HI>Shaft.</HI> This inflamed his audience so greatly, that, after eating a hearty dinner to strengthen themselves, every owner of such house over which the shaft hung, with assistance of others, fawed off as much of it as hung over his premises: each took his share, and committed to the flames the tremendous idol. This <HI>Sir Stephen,</HI> scorning the use of the sober pulpit, sometimes mounted on a tomb, with his back to the altar, to pour out his nonsensical rhap∣sodies; at other times, he climbed into a lofty elm in the church∣yard, and, bestriding a bough, delivered out his cant with double effect, merely by reason of the novelty of the situation <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Stow's Survaie,</HI> 282, 283.</NOTE>.</P>

He was at the same time lord mayor of <HI>London,</HI> a lord of the admiralty, and the first governor of the bank of <HI>England.</HI> His mansion stood on the site of the house; the noblest monument he could have.</P>
<P>IT would be injustice not to give the name of the projector of that national glory the Bank of <HI>England.</HI> It was the happy thought of Mr. <HI>James Paterson,</HI> of the kingdom of <HI>Scotland.</HI> This <HI>Palladium</HI> of our country was, in 1780, saved from the fury of an infamous mob by the virtue of its citizens, who formed suddenly a volunteer company, and over-awed the miscreants; while the chief magistrate skulked trembling in his Mansion-house, and left his important charge to its fate. I cannot wonder at the timidity of a peaceful magistrate, when the principle of self-pre∣servation appeared so strong in the ministry of the day. It was the spirit of majesty itself that first dictated the means of putting a stop to the outrages; which, if exerted at first by its servants, would have been true mercy!</P>
<P>AT the extremity of <HI>Threadneedle-street,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">MERCHANT-TAYLORS HALL</NOTE> appears the origin of its name, in <HI>Merchant-Taylors hall;</HI> at the period in which they

were called <HI>Taylors,</HI> and <HI>Linen-armourers,</HI> under which title they were incorporated in the year 1480; and by <HI>Henry</HI> VII. by that of the men of the art and mystery of <HI>Merchant-taylors,</HI> of the fraternity of <HI>St. John the Baptist.</HI> They were seventh in the rank of the great companies. Multitudes of eminent men were emu∣lous of being admitted into it: seven kings, one queen, seventeen princes and dukes, two dutchesses, one archbishop, one and thirty earls, five countesses, one viscount, twenty-four bishops, sixty-six barons, two ladies, seven abbots, seven priors, and one sub-prior, besides squires innumerable, graced the long roll of freemen of this company <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strype's Stow, <HI>i.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>AMONG the portraits in this hall, is that of <HI>William Warham,</HI> archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and lord high chancellor of <HI>England.</HI> He went through the various offices, now allotted to laymen, with great abilities; was appointed master of the rolls in 1486; keeper of the great seal in 1502; and lord chancellor in 1503; and in the following year was advanced to the see of <HI>Canterbury.</HI> He was in high favor with <HI>Henry</HI> VII; but on the accession of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. was soon supplanted by <HI>Wolsey,</HI> and experienced his greatest insolence.

<P>NEXT is the portrait of <HI>Richard Fox,</HI> bishop of <HI>Winchester,</HI> an able statesman, greatly employed by <HI>Henry</HI> VII. at home and abroad; and continued for some time favored by his son. He first introduced <HI>Wolsey</HI> to court: but soon experienced his ingra∣titude.

Unable to bear his insolence, he, like <HI>Warham,</HI> retired from business. In his old age, when struck with blindness, the cardinal meanly hoped to prevale on him to resign his bishoprick, to which the good prelate returned a spirited reply. He lived to a great age, and died in 1528, after worthily governing the see twenty-seven years.</P>
<P>FOR the many good deeds of Sir <HI>Thomas Row,</HI> merchant-tay∣lor, his portrait must not be passed by. He is dressed in a bonnet, ruff, and red gown. He first established a substantial standing watch in the city, when he was lord mayor, in 1569.

<P>IT was one of this meek profession, actuated by the religion of meekness, who first suggested the pious project of abolishing the slave trade. <HI>Thomas Woolman,</HI> a quaker, and taylor, of <HI>New Jer∣sey,</HI> was first struck with the thought, that engaging in the traffic of the human species was incompatible with the spirit of the Christian religion. He published many tracts against this un∣happy species of commerce: he argued against it in public and private: he made long journies for the sake of talking to indivi∣duals on the subject; and was careful, himself, not to countenance slavery, by the use of those conveniences which were provided by the labor of slaves.

In the year 1720, by the villainy of the directors, it became the most notorious bubble ever heard of in any kingdom.

Thomas Cromwel,</HI> earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> built a magnificent house on its site: he shewed very little scruples in invading the rights of his neighbors to enlarge his domain. <HI>Stow</HI> mentions his own father as a sufferer; for the earl arbitrarily loosened from its place a house which stood in <HI>Stow</HI>'s garden, placed it on roll∣ers, and had it carried twenty-two feet farther off, without giving the least notice: and no one dared to complain <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Survaie,</HI> 342,</NOTE>. The manner of removing this house, shews what miserable tenements a certain rank of people had, which could, like the houses in <HI>Moscow,</HI> be so easily conveyed from place to place. After <HI>Cromwel</HI>'s fall, the house and gardens were bought by the Drapers company. The house was destroyed in the great fire, but rebuilt, for the use

of their company, in a magnificent manner. This was the farthest limits of the fire northward, as <HI>Allhallows</HI> church, in <HI>Fenchurch-street,</HI> was to the east.</P>
<P>IN the hall, a very elegant room, is a portrait of the first mayor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PORTRAITS.</NOTE> of <HI>London, Fitz-alwin,</HI> a half length. I need not say a fictitious likeness. In his days, I doubt whether the artists equalled in any degree the worst of our modern sign-painters.</P>

<P>THE Drapers were incorporated in 1430. The art of weaving woollen cloth was only introduced in 1360, by the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Flemings:</HI> but, as it was long permitted to export our wool, and receive it again manufactured into cloth, the cloth trade made little progress in <HI>England</HI> till the reign of queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Anderson,</HI> i. 406.</NOTE>, who may be said to have been the foundress of the wealthy loom, as of many other good things in this kingdom.</P>

<P>AT the dissolution, great part of the house, cloisters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">WINCHESTER-HOUSE.</NOTE> and gar∣dens were granted to <HI>William</HI> lord <HI>St. John,</HI> afterwards marquis of <HI>Winchester,</HI> and lord treasurer. On the site he built <HI>Winchester-place,</HI> a magnificent house, where <HI>Winchester-street</HI> now stands. The west end of the church was in 1551 granted to <HI>John a Lasco</HI> for the use of the <HI>Germans,</HI> and other fugitive Protestants, and afterwards to the <HI>Dutch</HI> as a preaching-place. Part also was converted into a glass-house for <HI>Venice</HI> glass, in which <HI>Venetians</HI> were employed in every branch of this manufacture. They were patronized by the duke of <HI>Buckingham. Howel,</HI> the celebrated author of the Letters, was steward to the manufacture, but was obliged to quit his office, not being able to endure the heat. He had been at <HI>Venice</HI> in 1621 <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Howel's Letters, <HI>56.</HI></NOTE>, probably to pry into the se∣crets of the art, and to engage workmen. This place was after∣wards converted into <HI>Pinners-hall,</HI> or the hall of the company of Pin-makers.</P>
<P>THE other part the marquis reserved for the purpose of stowing corn, coal, and other things. His son sold the noble monuments of the dead, the paving-stones, and many other materials, which had cost thousands, for a hundred pounds, and converted the build∣ing into stables for his horses <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Kennet,</HI> i. 336, 337.</NOTE>. The steeple was standing in the year 1600. It was so beautiful, that the mayor and several re∣spectable citizens petitioned the marquis that it might not be

<P>BEHIND this church, close to <HI>London wall,</HI> stood the <HI>Papey,</HI> a fraternity of St. <HI>Charilibis</HI> and St. <HI>John</HI> the <HI>evangelist,</HI> for <HI>Papeys,</HI> or poor infirm priests, founded in 1430 by certain chauntry priests. It was a numerous society, designed to relieve any of its members, who by lameness or illness were reduced to distress or poverty, whether they were brothers or sisters. The church of St. <HI>Augustine Papey</HI> belonged to this fraternity. These priests, the brotherhood of threescore priests of <HI>Leaden-hall,</HI> and the company of parish clerks, who were skilled in singing <HI>diriges</HI> and funeral office, were accustomed to attend the solemn burials of the rich or great. These are frequently represented on the sides of antient tombs, and were called <HI>pleureurs, weepers,</HI> and <HI>mourners.</HI> This house became, after the suppression, the habitation of Sir <HI>Francis Walsingham.</HI></P>
<P>IN <HI>Winchester-street</HI> stood also a great house, called the <HI>Spanish</HI> ambassador's, which was occupied by Sir <HI>James Houblon,</HI> knight and alderman: and at the same period it was the residence of se∣veral of our most eminent merchants.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">SIR THOMAS GRESHAM'S HOUSE.</NOTE>TO the east side of the same street, stood the house of our first of merchants, Sir <HI>Thomas Gresham;</HI> originally built with brick and timber, and fronting to <HI>Bishopsgate-street.</HI> By his will he appointed four lecturers in divinity, astronomy, music, and geometry, and three readers in civil law, physic, and rhetoric, each with a salary of fifty pounds a year, payable out of the rent issuing out of the Royal Exchange. This house was the place where the professors
<PB N="411" REF="438"/>
had their apartments, and where the lectures were to be read; which were begun in 1597, but they are now quite deserted. This arose in a great degree from the institution of the ROYAL SOCIETY: the meetings of which were for a considerable time held here.</P>
<P>THE origin of that respectable body was from the meeting of a few illustrious persons at the lodgings of doctor <HI>Wilkins,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ORIGIN OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY.</NOTE> after∣wards bishop of <HI>Chester,</HI> and others worthy of record, doctor <HI>Seth Ward,</HI> afterwards bishop of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> Mr. BOYLE, Sir <HI>William Petty,</HI> and the doctors <HI>Wallis, Goddard, Willis,</HI> and <HI>Bathurst,</HI> Sir <HI>Christopher Wren,</HI> and a few more. In 1658, they assembled in <HI>Gresham</HI> college, by permission of the professors of the foundation of Sir <HI>Thomas Gresham;</HI> and on the Restoration were incorpo∣rated by royal charter. A most instructive and well-founded Museum was established here in 1677, by <HI>Henry Colwall,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ITS MUSEUM.</NOTE> consist∣ing of natural and artificial curiosities, collected with great ex∣pence and judgment. The society had a benefit never known at any other time, the assistance of the great Mr. BOYLE, the most accomplished, most learned, and most religious virtuoso, who pointed out the proper objects of their collection, and gave them the most finished instructions <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These were collected and published in 1692. This little book is a most ne∣cessary companion for all travellers and voyagers.</NOTE> for procuring them from every quarter of the globe. At that period there were, in both the <HI>In∣dies,</HI> persons capable of understanding, and pursuing with suc∣cess, the plan laid down for them at home. It was the good for∣tune of the <HI>Museum</HI> to have, co-existent with its formation, a phi∣losopher
<PB N="412" REF="439"/>
for its Curator, fully qualified to describe its various ar∣ticles. Doctor <HI>Nehemiah Grew</HI> not only performed that part, but illustrated every one, in cases where the subject admitted, with the most learned and pertinent remarks. He published his <HI>Museum Regalis Societatis</HI> in 1681, and dedicated it to the foun∣der, Mr. <HI>Colwall,</HI> at the expence of whom the plates were en∣graven. It is a work equal to the <HI>Museum Wormianum,</HI> and any other admired foreign performance of that age. Its defects arise only from the want of system, the misfortune of the time; for our RAY had not then cleared the rich ore of Natural History from the surrounding rubbish. About the year 1711, the Society re∣moved from hence to <HI>Crane-court</HI> in <HI>Fleet-street.</HI> For numbers of years the <HI>Museum</HI> was neglected. My respected friend, the ho∣nourable <HI>Daines Barrington,</HI> with most disinterested zeal, under∣took the restoring it, as far as the ravages of time would permit. This he did in the most effectual manner; and enriched it with a number of new specimens, especially from our late colonies: it being his design to have formed it into a repository of every thing relative to the natural history of <HI>Great Britain</HI> and its dependen∣cies: a most noble plan, and worthy of being carried into full execution. By singular chance, <HI>Gresham</HI> college escaped the flames in 1666; but I believe very little of the original house re∣mains: it having been mostly rebuilt in 1601, possibly after the original design; the arcades being adapted for the reception of the numbers of commercial and other followers of so universal a merchant as Sir <HI>Thomas Gresham.</HI></P>

HELEN'S THE GREAT.</NOTE> stands the antient church known by the name of <HI>St. Helen's the Great;</HI> in it are numbers of curious tombs: they fortunately escaped the ravages of the great fire. That of the great benefactor to the city, Sir <HI>Thomas Gresham,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">TOMB OF SIR T.

So great a name wanted not the proclamation of an epitaph, so it is entirely without inscription.</P>
<P>A most magnificent tomb of Sir <HI>William Pickering,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SIR WILLIAM PICKERING.</NOTE> who died in <HI>London,</HI> at <HI>Pickering-house,</HI> in 1574, aged 58. He lies recum∣bent, in rich gilt and painted armour, small ruff, short hair, trunk breeches; the mat he rests on is finely cut. He had served four princes: <HI>Henry</HI> VIII, in the field; <HI>Edward</HI> VI, as ambassador to
<PB N="416" REF="443"/>
<HI>France;</HI> queen <HI>Mary,</HI> in <HI>Germany;</HI> and finally, queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI>
<Q>Elizabeth, <HI>(says his epitaph)</HI> principi omnium illustrissimae sum∣mis officiis devotissimus.</Q>
He is said to have aspired at the pos∣session of her person <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Kennet's Hist.</HI> ii. 383.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">WILLIAM BOND.</NOTE>A TOMB of <HI>William Bond,</HI> who died in 1576, a merchant ad∣venturer, and the most famous of his age for voyages by land and sea. He, his wife, and seven children, are represented kneeling. The lady is distinguished by her vast sleeves.</P>
<P>THEIR son <HI>Martin</HI> took a military turn: he was captain in the camp at <HI>Tilbury,</HI> in 1588, and chief captain in the train-bands till his death. He is represented in armour, in his tent; soldiers are seen on the outside, and his servant waiting with his horse.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">SIR JULIUS CESAR.</NOTE>I OMIT many splendid monuments, which record that the pos∣sessors were good men and good citizens. That of Sir <HI>Julius Adelmar Cesar,</HI> who died a superannuated master of the Rolls in 1636, is very singular. His epitaph is cut on a black slab in form of a piece of parchment with a seal appendant, by which he gives his bond to Heaven, to resign his life willingly whenever it should please GOD to call him. <HI>In cujus rei testimonium manum meam et sigillum apposui.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">RICHARD BANCROFT.</NOTE>IN a plain square mausoleum is lodged the embalmed corpse of <HI>Richard Bancroft,</HI> placed in a chest with a lid fastened only with hinges, and over the face is a glass pane.

He left twenty shillings to the minister to preach annually a commemoration-sermon <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Northouk's Hist. of London, <HI>557.</HI></NOTE>. The almsmen and scholars attended, and his body was brought out for public inspection. But I think that this custom, as well as the sermon, have been of late years laid aside.</P>
<P>HERE is also another tomb, seemingly belonging to some per∣sons of rank: it is of an altar form; on it lie recumbent two ala∣baster figures, one of a beardless man, with his hair cut short and round; over his shoulders is a robe, a fine collar round his neck, his body armed, and a griffin at his feet. By him lies his lady.</P>
<P>I NOW visit the third street which branches from the <HI>Poultry,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">LOMBARD-STREET.</NOTE> that which took its name from the <HI>Lombards,</HI> the great money-changers and usurers of early times. They came out of <HI>Italy</HI> into our kingdom before the year 1274 <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Anderson,</HI> i. 406.</NOTE>; at length their ex∣tortions became so great, that <HI>Edward</HI> III. seized on their estates; perhaps the necessity of furnishing him with money for his <HI>Flemish</HI> expedition, might have urged him to this step. They seem quickly to have repaired their loss; for complaint was soon after made against them, for persisting in their practices. They were so opulent in the days of <HI>Henry</HI> VI. as to be able to furnish him with money, but they took care to get the customs mort∣gaged to them by way of security <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The same, 231.</NOTE>.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">POST-OFFICE.</NOTE>THE <HI>Post-office,</HI> which gives wings to the extension of com∣merce, stands in <HI>Lombard-street.</HI> The office of chief postmaster was erected in 1551 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Asterisks</HI> mark my authority as from Mr. <HI>Anderson;</HI> the rest are more doubtful, except from the words <HI>net income,</HI> in the next page.</NOTE>, but we are not told how this branch of business was managed; however it was not regularly established till the year 1644, when Mr. <HI>Edmund Prideaux,</HI> the inland post∣master, was supposed to collect about five thousand pounds a year.</P>
<P>IN 1654, the parlement farmed the post-office to a Mr. <HI>Manly,</HI> for £. 100,000.

<P>ON the Restoration, a general Post-office was established in <HI>London,</HI> to be under the direction of a postmaster to be appointed by the king; and with powers to appoint post-houses in such parts of the country which were unprovided, both on the post and by-roads.</P>

<P>THE privilege of franking was first clamed by the commons in 1660, and allowed to both houses by the crown in the follow∣ing year. The abuse must have been very great, it being asserted, that in 1763, the loss by that privilege amounted to £. 170,700. I have seen in some private notes, that the gross of the year's re∣venue was £. 432,048; and from better authority, that the <HI>net</HI> income of 1763, the year previous to the first regulation of frank∣ing, was £. 97,833; which, in 1764, increased to £. 116,182.</P>
<P>IN the year ending in <HI>August,</HI> 1784, the <HI>net</HI> revenue amounted to £. 159,625. The act for the second regulation took place in that month; in the following year it increased to £. 196,513, and in the succeeding, to £. 261,409; and in the last (1788) by rea∣son of our national prosperity, to £. 280,000.</P>
<P>BEFORE the great fire, on the site of the present office stood a much-frequented tavern. When it was destroyed by that calamity, the convivial Sir <HI>Robert Viner</HI> replaced it with a large house for his own habitation. Sir <HI>Robert,</HI> during his mayoralty, in 1675, was honored with the presence of his monarch, <HI>Charles</HI> II; his
<PB N="420" REF="448"/>
majesty was for retiring, after staying the usual time, but Sir <HI>Robert,</HI> filled with good liquor and loyalty, laid hold of the king, and swore,
<Q>Sir, you shall take t'other bottle. The airy mo∣narch looked kindly at him over the shoulder, and with a smile, and graceful air, repeated this line of the old song:
<Q>"He that's drunk is as great as a king,"</Q>
and immediately turned back, and complied with his land∣lord <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Spectator,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 461.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>IN the same street, towards <HI>Birchin Lane,</HI> stood the house of <HI>William de la Pole</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Stow's Survaie, <HI>384.</HI></NOTE>, created in <HI>France,</HI> by <HI>Edward</HI> III. knight-banneret, with allowance out of the customs of <HI>Hull</HI> for the sup∣port of his dignity <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vincent's Discoverie,</HI> &amp;c. 500.</NOTE>. He was a great merchant, and, being very opulent, used to supply the king's pecuniary wants. He was at the same time the <HI>King's merchant;</HI> an office that gave him the lucrative privilege of supplying his master with different sorts of merchandize, and also with money. The office seems to have been continued to later days, under another name: <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. had his <HI>King's factor,</HI> and Sir <HI>Thomas Gresham</HI> bore the title of the <HI>Queen's. Richard (William's</HI> elder brother, a merchant at <HI>Hull)</HI> had the same employ under <HI>Edward</HI> III, who calls him <HI>di∣lectus mercator Ricardus de la Pole Pincerna noster</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">The same.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>William</HI> sprung a numerous race of nobility, distin∣guished by their ambition and unfortunate ends. His son <HI>Mi∣chael</HI>
<PB N="421" REF="449"/>
was created earl of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> yet continued in his office of <HI>King's merchant,</HI> and lived in his father's house <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stow's Survaie, <HI>384.</HI></NOTE>. He at length became lord high chancellor; but, being accused of embezzling the public money, and divers other crimes, was banished the kingdom, and died at <HI>Paris</HI> in 1389, of a broken heart. His son <HI>Michael</HI> was restored, and died of a flux at the siege of <HI>Har∣fleur,</HI> in <HI>Sept.</HI> 1415; and in the very following month, his son and successor, another <HI>Michael,</HI> fell in the battle of <HI>Agincourt.</HI> His brother <HI>William</HI> succeeded, and was afterwards created mar∣quis, and then duke of <HI>Suffolk.</HI> He was the favorite of the spi∣rited <HI>Margaret</HI> of <HI>Anjou.</HI> He was of distinguished abilities, but by his insolence enraged the nobility so greatly, that on an accu∣sation of his being the cause of the loss of <HI>France,</HI> they banished him the kingdom. On his passage to <HI>Calais,</HI> he was seized by a vessel sent expressly to intercept him, and was brought into <HI>Dover,</HI> beheaded by the captain of the ship in the cock-boat, without ceremony, and his body flung upon the sands, where it was found by his chaplain, and buried at <HI>Wingfield</HI> in <HI>Suffolk.</HI> The nobility dreaded his return, therefore took this method to free themselves from so formidable an enemy <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See the curious particulars in Sir <HI>John Fenn</HI>'s, i. 39, 48, truly stated.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">DENMARK-HOUSE.</NOTE>In <HI>Fenchurch-street,</HI> a continuation of the former, stood <HI>Den∣mark-house.</HI> In it was lodged the ambassador sent, in 1557, as <HI>Holinshed</HI> expresses it, from the emperor of <HI>Cathaie, Muscovia,</HI> and <HI>Russeland.</HI> This was in consequence of the new discovery of the <HI>White Sea</HI> by <HI>Chancellor:</HI> for till that time <HI>Russia</HI> was quite im∣pervious by any other way.

Lord <HI>Montacute,</HI> with the queen's pensioners, met him at <HI>Islington;</HI> and the lord mayor and aldermen, in scarlet robes, received him at <HI>Smithfield,</HI> and from thence rode with him to this house, then "Maister <HI>Dimmock's,</HI> in <HI>Fenchurch Street</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Holinshed,</HI> 1132.</NOTE>."

<P>I SHOULD speak with the prejudices of a true <HI>Englishman,</HI> was I to dignify the <HI>Thames</HI> with the title of the chief of rivers. I must qualify my patriotism with its just clame to that of first of island-rivers. But in respect to our rival kingdom, it must yield the palm to the <HI>Garonne,</HI> only we must not make com∣parison of length of course. The contracted space of our island must limit that species of grandeur; but there are none, in any part of <HI>Europe,</HI> which can boast of more utility in bringing farther from the ocean the largest commercial ships; nor are there any which can bring the riches of the universe to their very capital. The ships of the <HI>Seine</HI> discharge themselves at <HI>Havre;</HI> those of the <HI>Loire</HI> reach no farther than <HI>Port-Lannai,</HI> far below its <HI>empo∣rium Nantes;</HI> and the <HI>Garonne</HI> conveys no farther than <HI>Pouillac</HI> the full-loaden ships: there they are obliged to be eased of part of their cargoes, before they can reach the opulent <HI>Bourdeaux.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Thames</HI> rises beneath <HI>Sufferton-hill,</HI> just within the borders of <HI>Glocestershire,</HI> a little to the south-west of <HI>Cirencester,</HI> which it instantly quits, and enters for a short space into the county of <HI>Wilts,</HI> bends a little into it, and re-enters its parent province near <HI>Lechlade,</HI> where (by means of locks) it first becomes naviga∣ble, and, as is said, for barges of seventy tons. It here leaves <HI>Glocestershire,</HI> and becomes the whole southern boundary of <HI>Ox∣fordshire,</HI> or the northern of <HI>Berkshire,</HI> and from thence is the southe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n limit of <HI>Buckinghamshire.</HI> At <HI>Great Marlow,</HI> in that
<PB N="424" REF="452"/>
county, is the last lock; from thence to the sea it requires no farther an to aid its navigation. At a small distance from <HI>Windsor</HI> it divides <HI>Middlesex</HI> from <HI>Surry;</HI> just above <HI>Kingston</HI> it feels the last feeble efforts of a tide;<NOTE PLACE="marg">TIDE.</NOTE> from thence is a most important in∣crease: just below <HI>London-bridge,</HI> eighteen feet; and at <HI>Deptford,</HI> twenty. The preceding, brings ships of three hundred and fifty tons, drawing sixteen feet water, to the custom-house; the last, those of a thousand tons, even the largest, drawing twenty-three feet, which import the treasures of <HI>India.</HI> This noble river con∣tinues fresh as low as <HI>Woolwich,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">WHERE BRACKISH.</NOTE> and even there is brackish only at spring-tides. Thus at our capital it is perfectly pure, salubrious, and subservient to vast articles of commerce, with which that stupendous city abounds.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> LENGTH.</NOTE>THE whole course of the <HI>Thames,</HI> to its mouth, is considerably above two hundred miles. I contract its length very considerably, in comparison of the usual estimation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ITS PROPER MOUTH.</NOTE> for I limit its mouth to the spot between the west end of the isle of <HI>Grain,</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> and the eastern part of that of <HI>Canvey</HI> in <HI>Essex.</HI> From those plates to the <HI>Naze</HI> in the latter county, and the <HI>North Foreland</HI> in that of <HI>Kent</HI> (which have hitherto been considered as its entrance) it ceases to flow in a single channel; it becomes a vast estuary filled with sandbanks, many of which appear above water at the recess of the tides.</P>
<P>THE whole course of the river is through a country which fur∣nishes every idea of opulence, fertility, and rural elegance: mea∣dows rich in hay, or covered with numerous herds; gentle risings, and hanging woods; embellished with palaces, magnificent seats,
<PB N="425" REF="453"/>
or beautiful villas, a few the hereditary mansions of our antient gentry, but the greater part property transferred, by the effects of vice and dissipation, to the owners of honest wealth, acquired by commerce, or industrious professions, or the dear purchase of cankering rapine. Its course furnishes few sublime scenes, ex∣cepting the high chalky cliffs near <HI>Henley;</HI> all its banks are re∣plete with native softness, improved by art and the fullest culti∣vation.</P>
<P>I DO not recollect that it flows in any part over a rocky channel; its bottom is either gravelly or clayey, according to the nature of the soil through which it meanders. This gives growth to the abundance of weeds with which it is in many parts filled; and these prove the safety of multitudes of fishes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">FISH.</NOTE> and preserve them from being extirpated by the unbridled ravages of the poachers. The <HI>Thames</HI> has, between its source and <HI>Woolwich,</HI> every species found in the <HI>British</HI> rivers, except the BURBOT, the LOCHE, the COBITIS TAENIA, or SPINY LOCHE, of late years discovered in the river <HI>Trent,</HI> and the small species of SALMON, the SAMLET. The SALMON, and the SHAD, are fishes of passage; the first appears in the river about the middle of <HI>February,</HI> is in great estimation, and sells at a vast price; their capture is prohibited from the 24th of <HI>August</HI> to the 11th of <HI>November.</HI> The SHAD arrives the latter end of <HI>May,</HI> or beginning of <HI>June,</HI> and is a very coarse fish; it sometimes grows to the weight of eight pounds, but the usual size is from four to five.

<P>BEDFORD-ROW, in this neighborhood,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BEDFORD-ROW.</NOTE> took its name from the uses to which those lands, and others adjacent, were be∣queathed by Sir <HI>William Harpur,</HI> son of <HI>William Harpur,</HI> of <HI>Bed∣ford;</HI> viz. to found a free and perpetual school, in that his native place; for portioning poor maidens; for supporting poor children; and for maintaining the poor with the surplus; all of them inhabi∣tants of the said town. Part of the lands were of his own inheri∣tance; part belonging to the <HI>Chartreux,</HI> at that time lately dissolved. Some of the lands were lost, others granted to Sir <HI>Thomas Fisher,</HI> baronet, for other lands belonging to him; the remainder granted, in the year 1668, upon lease, by the corporation of <HI>Bedford,</HI> trustees to the charity, for the purposes of building, for the term of forty-one years, at the yearly rent of ninety-nine years: and in 1684, the reversion to <HI>Nicholas Barbon,</HI> D. D. for the further term of fifty-one years, at the rent of a hundred and fifty, on the expira∣tion of the first lease. <HI>Bedford-street, Bedford-row</HI> and <HI>court, Prin∣ces-street, Theobald's-row, North-street, East-street, Lamb's-con∣duit-street, Queen-street, Eagle-street, Boswel-court,</HI> and several other streets, rose in consequence, by which the rents were most consi∣derably increased. A suit arose, about the year 1725, between the warden and fellows of <HI>New College,</HI> and the corporation of <HI>Bed∣ford,</HI> concerning the right of appointing the masters to the school, and their salaries. The same was decided, in 1725, in favor of the college; and that the corporation was to pay the head master
<PB N="430" REF="458"/>
thirty pounds a year, and the usher twenty; and the other chari∣ties to be paid proportionably to the revenues of the estate.</P>
<P>ON the expiration of the two leases, in 1760, the annual reve∣nues arising from the rents were found to amount to £. 2,336. 17 <HI>s.</HI> and the houses at will to £. 273. And it was found that improve∣ments might be made which would increase the revenue so far as to make the whole amount to £. 3,000 a year. In fact, in 1788, they did amount to £. 2,917. 17 <HI>s.</HI></P>
<P>AMONG other regulations, in consequence of the increased revenue, by an act made about the year 1762, new houses were directed to be built for the schoolmaster, usher, and writing-mas∣ter. The head-master's salary to be augmented to £. 200 per ann.; the usher's to £. 100; the writing-master's to £. 60. To∣wards the portioning of the poor maidens £. 800 was to be annu∣ally given; £. 600 to be annually given towards apprenticing poor children. And I might add several other particulars, which I omit, as not relative to the city, the subject of these sheets.</P>
