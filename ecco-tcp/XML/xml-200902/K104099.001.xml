<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE intent of the following Volumes is to preserve to the Public those poe∣tical performances, which seemed to merit a longer remembrance, than what would pro∣bably be secured to them by the MANNER wherein they were originally published. This design was first suggested to the Editor, as it was afterwards conducted, by the opinions of some Gentlemen, whose names it would do him the highest honour to mention. He desires in this place also to make his acknow∣ledgments to the Authors of several pieces in∣serted in these Volumes, which were never be∣fore in print; and which, he is persuaded, would be thought to add credit to the most judicious collection of this kind in our lan∣guage. He hath nothing farther to premise, but that the Reader must not expect to be
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
pleased with every particular poem which is here presented to him. It is impossible to furnish out an entertainment of this nature, where every part shall be relished by every guest: it will be sufficient, if nothing is set before him, but what has been approved by those of the most acknowledged taste.</P>

<L>COntending kings, and fields of death, too long</L>
<L>Have been the subject of the British song,</L>
<L>Who hath not read of fam'd Ramilia's plain,</L>
<L>Bavaria's fall, and Danube choak'd with slain?</L>
<L>Exhausted themes! A gentle note I raise,</L>
<L>And sing returning Peace in softer lays.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="6"/>Their fury quell'd, and martial rage allay'd,</L>
<L>I wait our heroes in the sylvan shade:</L>
<L>Disbanding hosts are imag'd to my mind,</L>
<L>And warring pow'rs in friendly leagues combin'd;</L>
<L>While ease and pleasure make the nations smile,</L>
<L>And heav'n and ANNA bless Britannia's isle.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Well sends our Queen her mitred BRISTOL forth,</L>
<L>For early counsels fam'd, and long-try'd worth,</L>
<L>Who, thirty rolling years, had oft with-held</L>
<L>The Suede and Saxon from the dusty field;</L>
<L>Compleatly form'd, to heal the Christian wounds,</L>
<L>To name the kings, and give each kingdom bounds;</L>
<L>The face of ravag'd nature to repair,</L>
<L>By leagues to soften earth, and heav'n by pray'r;</L>
<L>To gain by love, where rage and slaughter fail,</L>
<L>And make the crosier o'er the sword prevail.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So when great Moses, with JEHOVAH'S wand,</L>
<L>Had scatter'd plagues o'er stubborn Pharaoh's land,</L>
<L>Now spread an host of locusts round the shore,</L>
<L>Now turn'd Nile's fatt'ning streams to putrid gore;</L>
<L>Plenty and gladness mark'd the priest of God,</L>
<L>And sudden almonds shot from Aaron's rod.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O thou, from whom these bounteous blessings flow,</L>
<L>To whom, as chief, the hopes of peace we owe,</L>
<L>(For next to thee, the man whom kings contend</L>
<L>To stile companion, and to make their friend,</L>
<L>Great STRAFFORD, rich in every courtly grace,</L>
<L>With joyful pride accepts the second place)</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="7"/>From Britain's isle, and Isis' sacred spring</L>
<L>One hour, oh! listen while the muses sing.</L>
<L>Tho' ministers of mighty monarchs wait,</L>
<L>With beating hearts, to learn their masters' fate,</L>
<L>One hour forbear to speak thy Queen's commands,</L>
<L>Nor think the world, thy charge, neglected stands;</L>
<L>The blissful prospects, in my verse display'd,</L>
<L>May lure the stubborn, the deceiv'd persuade,</L>
<L>Ev'n thou to peace shalt speedier urge the way,</L>
<L>And more be hasten'd by this short delay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The haughty Gaul, in ten campaigns o'erthrown,</L>
<L>Now ceas'd to think the western world his own.</L>
<L>Oft had he mourn'd his boasting leaders bound,</L>
<L>And his proud bulwarks smoaking on the ground;</L>
<L>In vain with pow'rs renew'd he fill'd the plain,</L>
<L>Made tim'rous vows, and brib'd the saints in vain;</L>
<L>As oft his legions did the fight decline,</L>
<L>Lurk'd in the trench, and skulk'd behind the line.</L>
<L>Before his eyes the fancy'd jav'lin gleams;</L>
<L>At feasts he starts, and seems dethron'd in dreams;</L>
<L>On glory past reflects with secret pain,</L>
<L>On mines exhausted, and on millions slain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To Britain's Queen the scepter'd suppliant bends,</L>
<L>To her his crowns and infant race commends,</L>
<L>Who grieves her fame with christian blood to buy,</L>
<L>Nor asks for glory at a price so high.</L>
<L>At her decree the war suspended stands,</L>
<L>And Britain's heroes hold their lifted hands:</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="8"/>Their open brows no threat'ning frowns disguise,</L>
<L>But gentler passions sparkle in their eyes.</L>
<L>The Gauls, who never in their courts could find</L>
<L>Such temper'd fire with manly beauty join'd,</L>
<L>Doubt if they're those, whom dreadful to the view</L>
<L>In forms so fierce their fearful fancies drew,</L>
<L>At whose dire names ten thousand widows press'd</L>
<L>Their helpless orphans clinging to the breast.</L>
<L>In silent rapture each his foe surveys,</L>
<L>They vow firm friendship, and give mutual praise.</L>
<L>Brave minds, howe'er at war, are secret friends,</L>
<L>Their gen'rous discord with the battle ends;</L>
<L>In peace they wonder whence dissention rose,</L>
<L>And ask how souls so like could e'er be foes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Methinks I hear more friendly shouts rebound,</L>
<L>And social clarions mix their sprightly sound;</L>
<L>The British flags are furl'd, her troops disband,</L>
<L>And scatter'd armies seek their native land.</L>
<L>The hardy veteran, proud of many a scar,</L>
<L>The manly charms and honours of the war,</L>
<L>Who hop'd to share his friend's illustrious doom,</L>
<L>And in the battle find a soldier's tomb,</L>
<L>Leans on his spear to take his farewel view,</L>
<L>And sighing bids the glorious camp adieu.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye generous fair, receive the brave with smiles,</L>
<L>O'erpay their sleepless nights, and crown their toils;</L>
<L>Soft beauty is the gallant soldier's due,</L>
<L>For you they conquer, and they bleed for you.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="9"/>In vain proud Gaul with boastul Spain conspires,</L>
<L>When English valour English beauty fires;</L>
<L>The nations dread your eyes, and kings despair</L>
<L>Of chiefs so brave, till they have nymphs so fair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>See the fond wife, in tears of transport drown'd,</L>
<L>Hugs her rough lord, and weeps o'er ev'ry wound;</L>
<L>Hangs on the lips, that fields of blood relate,</L>
<L>And smiles and trembles, at his various fate.</L>
<L>Near the full bowl he draws the fancied line,</L>
<L>And marks feign'd trenches in the flowing wine,</L>
<L>Then sets th' invested fort before her eyes,</L>
<L>And mines that whirl'd battalions to the skies;</L>
<L>His little list'ning progeny turn pale,</L>
<L>And beg again to hear the dreadful tale.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such dire atchievements sings the bard that tells</L>
<L>Of palfrey'd dames, bold knights, and magic spells;</L>
<L>Where whole brigades one champion's arms o'erthrow,</L>
<L>And cleave a giant at a random blow;</L>
<L>Slay panyms vile, that force the fair; and tame</L>
<L>The goblin's fury, and the dragon's flame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our eager youth to distant nations run,</L>
<L>To visit fields their valiant fathers won;</L>
<L>From Flandria's shore their country's fame they trace,</L>
<L>Till far Germania shews her blasted face.</L>
<L>Th' exulting Briton asks his mournful guide,</L>
<L>Where his hard fate the lost Bavaria try'd;</L>
<L>Where Stepney grav'd the stone to ANNA'S fame:</L>
<L>He points to Blenheim, once a vulgar name;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="10"/>Here fled the Houshold, there did Tallard yield,</L>
<L>Here Malb'rough turn'd the fortune of the field;</L>
<L>On those steep banks, near Danube's raging flood,</L>
<L>The Gauls thrice started back, and trembling stood;</L>
<L>When, Churchill's arm perceiv'd, they stood not long,</L>
<L>But plung'd amidst the waves, a desperate throng;</L>
<L>Crowds whelm'd on crowds dash'd wide the watry bed,</L>
<L>And drove the current to its distant head.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As when by Raphael's, or by Kneller's hands</L>
<L>A warlike courser on the canvas stands,</L>
<L>Such as on Landen bleeding Ormond bore,</L>
<L>Or set young Ammon on the Granic shore;</L>
<L>If chance a gen'rous steed the work behold,</L>
<L>He snorts, he neighs, he champs the foamy gold:</L>
<L>So, Hocstet seen, tumultuous passions roll,</L>
<L>And hints of glory fire the Briton's soul;</L>
<L>In fancy'd fights he sees the troops engage,</L>
<L>And all the tempest of the battle rage.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Charm me, ye pow'rs, with scenes less nobly bright,</L>
<L>Far humbler thoughts th' inglorious muse delight,</L>
<L>Content to see the horrors of the field</L>
<L>By plough-shares levell'd, or in flow'rs conceal'd.</L>
<L>O'er shatter'd walls may creeping ivy twine,</L>
<L>And grass luxuriant cloath the harmless mine,</L>
<L>Tame flocks ascend the breach without a wound,</L>
<L>Or crop the bastion, now a fruitful ground;</L>
<L>While shepherds sleep, along the rampart laid,</L>
<L>Or pipe beneath the formidable shade,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
<L>Who was the man? (Oblivion blast his name,</L>
<L>Torn out and blotted from the list of fame!)</L>
<L>Who, fond of lawless rule, and proudly brave,</L>
<L>First sunk the filial subject to a slave;</L>
<L>His neighbour's realms by frauds un-kingly gain'd,</L>
<L>In guiltless blood the sacred ermine stain'd;</L>
<L>Laid schemes for death, to slaughter turn'd his heart,</L>
<L>And fitted murder to the rules of art.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah! curs'd ambition, to thy lures we owe</L>
<L>All the great ills that mortals bear below.</L>
<L>Curs'd by the hind, when to the spoil he yields</L>
<L>His year's whole sweat and vainly-ripen'd fields;</L>
<L>Curs'd by the maid, torn from her lover's side,</L>
<L>When left a widow, though not yet a bride:</L>
<L>By mothers curs'd, when floods of tears they shed,</L>
<L>And scatter useless roses on the dead.</L>
<L>Oh sacred BRISTOL! then what dangers prove</L>
<L>The arts, thou smil'st on with paternal love?</L>
<L>Then, mix'd with rubbish by the brutal foes,</L>
<L>In vain the marble breathes, the canvas glows;</L>
<L>To shades obscure the glitt'ring sword pursues</L>
<L>The gentle poet and defenceless muse.</L>
<L>A voice, like thine alone, might then asswage</L>
<L>The warrior's fury, and controul his rage;</L>
<L>To hear thee speak might the fierce Vandal stand,</L>
<L>And fling the brandish'd fabre from his hand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Far hence be driv'n to Scythia's stormy shore</L>
<L>The drum's harsh musick, and the cannon's roar;</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="12"/>Let grim Bellona haunt the lawless plain,</L>
<L>Where Tartar-clans and grisly Cossacks reign;</L>
<L>Let the steel'd Turk be deaf to matrons' cries,</L>
<L>See virgins ravish'd with relentless eyes;</L>
<L>To death grey heads and smiling infants doom,</L>
<L>Nor spare the promise of the pregnant womb;</L>
<L>O'er wasted kingdoms spread his wide command,</L>
<L>The savage lord of an unpeopled land.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Her guiltless glory just Britannia draws</L>
<L>From pure religion, and impartial laws:</L>
<L>To Europe's wounds a mother's aid she brings,</L>
<L>And holds in equal scales the rival kings:</L>
<L>Her gen'rous sons in choicest gifts abound,</L>
<L>Alike in arms, alike in arts renown'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As when sweet Venus, (so the fable sings)</L>
<L>Awak'd by Nereids from the Ocean springs;</L>
<L>With smiles she sees the threat'ning billows rise,</L>
<L>Spreads smooth the surge, and clears the louring skies;</L>
<L>Light, o'er the deep, with flutt'ring Cupids crown'd,</L>
<L>The pearly couch and silver turtles bound;</L>
<L>Her tresses shed ambrosial odours round.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Amidst the world of waves so stands serene</L>
<L>Britannia's isle, the Ocean's stately queen;</L>
<L>In vain the nations have conspir'd her fall,</L>
<L>Her trench the sea, and fleets her floating wall;</L>
<L>Defenceless barks, her powerful navy near,</L>
<L>Have only waves and hurricanes to fear.</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="13"/>What bold invader, or what land oppress'd</L>

<L>Say, where have e'er her union-crosses sail'd,</L>
<L>But much her arms, her justice more prevail'd?</L>

<L>In swarms the harness'd millions of the north;</L>
<L>Through realms of ice pursu'd his tedious way,</L>
<L>To court our friendship, and our fame survey!</L>
<L>Hence the rich prize of useful arts he bore,</L>
<L>And round his empire spread the learned store,</L>
<L>(T' adorn old realms is more than new to raise,</L>

<L>Did not the painted kings of India greet</L>
<L>Our Queen, and lay their scepters at her feet?</L>
<L>Chiefs who full bowls of hostile blood had quaff'd,</L>
<L>Fam'd for the javelin, and invenom'd shaft;</L>
<L>Whose haughty brows made savages adore,</L>
<L>Nor bow'd to less than stars, or sun before:</L>

<L>Where fumes of incense glad the southern seas,</L>
<L>And wafted citron scents the balmy breeze.</L>

<L>To grace great ANNE'S imperial diadem;</L>
<L>And here the ore, whose melted mass shall yield</L>
<L>On faithful coins each memorable field;</L>
<L>Which mix'd with medals of immortal Rome,</L>

<L>From fields of death to Woodstock's peaceful glooms</L>
<L>(The poet's haunt) Britannia's hero comes —</L>
<L>Begin, my muse, and softly touch the string:</L>
<L>Here Henry lov'd; and Chaucer learn'd to sing.</L>
<L>Hail fabled grotto! hail Elysian soil;</L>
<L>Thou fairest spot of fair Britannia's isle!</L>
<L>Where kings of old conceal'd forgot the throne,</L>

<L>Where love and war by turns pavilions rear,</L>

<L>Oriel alone a secret rage suppress'd,</L>

<L>Along the banks of Thame his empire ran,</L>
<L>Wide was his range, and populous his clan.</L>
<L>When cleanly servants, if we trust old tales,</L>
<L>Besides their wages had good fairy vails,</L>
<L>Whole heaps of silver tokens, nightly paid</L>
<L>The careful wife or the neat dairy-maid,</L>

<L>He gain'd the leaders of his neighbour tribes,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Mean-while driven back to earth, a lonely way</L>
<L>The chearless Albion wander'd half the day,</L>
<L>A long, long journey, choak'd with brakes and thorns,</L>
<L>Ill-measur'd by ten thousand barley-corns.</L>
<L>Tir'd out at length, a spreading stream he spy'd</L>
<L>Fed by old Thame, a daughter of the tide:</L>
<L>'Twas then a spreading stream, though now its fame</L>
<L>Obscur'd, it bears the creek's inglorious name,</L>
<L>And creeps, as through contracted bounds it strays,</L>
<L>A leap for boys in these degenerate days.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>On the clear crystal's verdant bank he stood,</L>
<L>And thrice look'd backward on the fatal wood,</L>
<L><PB N="51" REF="53"/>And thrice he groan'd, and thrice he beat his breast,</L>
<L>And thus in tears his kindred gods address'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'If true, ye watery powers, my lineage came</L>
<L>'From Neptune mingling with a mortal dame;</L>
<L>'Down to his court, with coral garlands crown'd,</L>
<L>'Through all your grottoes waft my plaintive sound,</L>
<L>'And urge the god, whose trident shakes the earth,</L>
<L>'To grace his off-spring, and assert my birth.'</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He said. A gentle Naiad heard his prayer,</L>
<L>And, touch'd with pity for a lover's care,</L>
<L>Shoots to the sea, where low beneath the tides</L>
<L>Old Neptune in th' unfathom'd depth resides.</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>As through the Thames her backward course she guides,</L>
<L>Driven up his current by the refluent tides,</L>
<L>Along his banks the pygmy legions spread</L>
<L>She spies, and haughty Oriel at their head.</L>

<L>She said. They bow'd: and on their shield up-bore</L>
<L>With shouts their new-saluted emperor.</L>

<L>What wonder if the youth, so strangely blest,</L>
<L>Felt his heart flutter in his little breast!</L>
<L>His thick-embattel'd troops, with secret pride,</L>

<L>Now the shrill corn-pipes, echoing loud to arms,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>On Buda's plains thus formidably bright,</L>
<L>Shone Asia's sons, a pleasing dreadful sight.</L>
<L>In various robes their silken troops were seen,</L>
<L>The blue, the red, and prophet's sacred green:</L>
<L>When blooming BRUNSWICK near the Danube's flood,</L>
<L>First stained his maiden sword in Turkish blood.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Unseen and silent march the slow brigades</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>The march concludes; and now in prospect near,</L>
<L>But fenc'd with arms, the hostile towers appear,</L>
<L>For Oberon, or Druids falsely sing,</L>
<L>Wore his prime visir in a magick ring.</L>
<L>A subtle spright, that opening plots foretold</L>
<L>By sudden dimness on the beamy gold.</L>
<L>Hence in a crescent form'd, his legions bright</L>
<L>With beating bosoms waited for the fight;</L>
<L>To charge their foes they march, a glitt'ring band,</L>
<L>And in their van doth bold Azuriel stand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What rage that hour did Albion's soul possess,</L>
<L>Let chiefs imagine, and let lovers guess!</L>
<L><PB N="54" REF="56"/>Forth issuing from his ranks, that strove in vain</L>
<L>To check his course, athwart the dreadful plain</L>
<L>He strides indignant: and with haughty cries</L>
<L>To single fight the fairy prince defies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Forbear, rash youth, th' unequal war to try;</L>
<L>Nor, sprung from mortals, with immortals vie.</L>
<L>No god stands ready to avert thy doom,</L>
<L>Nor yet thy grandsire of the waves is come.</L>
<L>My words are vain—no words the wretch can move,</L>
<L>By beauty dazled, and betwich'd by love:</L>
<L>He longs, he burns to win the glorious prize,</L>
<L>And sees no danger, while he sees her eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now from each host the eager warriors start,</L>
<L>And furious Albion flings his hasty dart:</L>
<L>'Twas feather'd from the bee's transparent wing,</L>
<L>And its shaft ended in a hornet's sting;</L>
<L>But, toss'd in rage, it flew without a wound,</L>
<L>High o'er the foe, and guiltless pierc'd the ground,</L>
<L>Not so Azuriel's: with un-erring aim</L>
<L>Too near the needle-pointed jav'lin came,</L>
<L>Drove through the seven-fold shield, and silken vest,</L>
<L>And lightly ras'd the lover's ivory breast.</L>
<L>Rous'd at the smart, and rising to the blow,</L>
<L>With his keen sword he cleaves his fairy foe,</L>
<L>Sheer from the shoulder to the waist he cleaves,</L>
<L>And of one arm the tott'ring trunk bereaves.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His useless steel brave Albion wields no more,</L>
<L>But sternly smiles, and thinks the combat o'er:</L>
<L><PB N="55" REF="57"/>So had it been, had aught of mortal strain,</L>
<L>Or less than fairy felt the deadly pain.</L>
<L>But empyreal forms, howe'er in fight</L>
<L>Gash'd and dismember'd, easily unite.</L>
<L>As some frail cup of China's purest mold,</L>
<L>With azure varnish'd, and bedrop'd with gold,</L>
<L>Tho' broke, if cur'd by some nice virgin's hands,</L>
<L>In its old strength and pristine beauty stands;</L>
<L>The tumults of the boiling Bohea braves,</L>
<L>And hold secure the Coffee's sable waves:</L>
<L>So did Azuriel's arm, if fame say true,</L>
<L>Rejoin the vital trunk whence first it grew;</L>
<L>And, whilst in wonder fix'd poor Albion stood,</L>
<L>Plung'd the curs'd sabre in his heart's warm blood.</L>
<L>The golden broidery tender Milkah wove,</L>
<L>The breast to Kenna sacred and to love,</L>
<L>Lie rent and mangled: and the gaping wound</L>
<L>Pours out a flood of purple on the ground.</L>
<L>The jetty lustre sickens in his eyes:</L>
<L>On his cold cheeks the bloomy freshness dies;</L>
<L>'Oh Kenna, Kenna, thrice he try'd to say,</L>
<L>'Kenna farewel:' and sigh'd his soul away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His fall the Dryads with loud shrieks deplore,</L>
<L>By sister Naiads echo'd from the shore,</L>
<L>Thence down to Neptune's secret realms convey'd,</L>
<L>Through grots, and glooms, and many a coral shade.</L>
<L>The sea's great sire, with looks denouncing war,</L>
<L>The trident shakes, and mounts the pearly carr:</L>
<L><PB N="56" REF="58"/>With one stern frown the wide-spread deep deforms,</L>
<L>And works the madding ocean into storms.</L>
<L>O'er foaming mountains, and through bursting tides,</L>

<L>'Till through the Thames in a loud whirlwind's roar</L>

<L>Th' embattel'd dwarfs with rage and scorn he past,</L>

<L>And a whole empire falls to sooth sad Albion's ghost.</L>

<L><PB N="109" REF="111"/>Of colonades, of corridores you talk,</L>

<L>But the dull workman's slow performing hand</L>
<L>But coldly executes his lord's command.</L>
<L>With dirt and mortar soon you grow displeas'd,</L>

<L>Bowers of retreat, and galleries of shade;</L>
<L>The shaven turf presents a lively green;</L>
<L>The bordering flow'rs in mystick knots are seen:</L>
<L>With studied art on nature you refine—</L>

<L>You quit the grove, so lately you admir'd;</L>
<L>With other views your eager hopes are fir'd,</L>
<L>Post to the city you direct your way;</L>
<L>Not blooming paradise could bribe your stay:</L>
<L>Ambition shews your power's brightest side;</L>
<L>'Tis meanly poor in solitude to hide.</L>

<L>Be happy then while yet you have to live;</L>
<L>And love is all the blessing heav'n can give.</L>
<L>Fir'd by new passion you address the fair;</L>
<L>Survey the opera as a gay parterre:</L>
<L>Young Cloe's bloom had made you certain prize,</L>

<L>You feel the poison swelling in your breast,</L>
<L>And all your soul by fond desire possess'd.</L>
<L>In dying sighs a long three hours are past;</L>
<L>To some assembly with impatient haste,</L>
<L>With trembling hope, and doubtful fear you move,</L>

<L>Unseen, unheard, the throng around me move;</L>
<L>Not wishing praise, insensible of love:</L>

<L>So num'rous herds are driven o'er the rock;</L>
<L>No print is left of all the passing flock:</L>

<L>"What tho' the gods a Nestor's age deny!</L>
<L>"Let management a longer life supply,</L>

<L>"You know yourself to form your happiness,</L>
<L>"Which in the shepherd's humble hut is found,</L>

<L>"Yet few with art their happiness pursue,</L>

<L><PB N="174" REF="176"/>"Nature our common mother has been kind,</L>

<BYLINE>By the Same.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>WHEN learning's triumph o'er her barb'rous foes</L>
<L>First rear'd the stage, immortal SHAKESPEAR rose;</L>
<L>Each change of many-colour'd life he drew,</L>
<L>Exhausted worlds, and then imagin'd new:</L>
<L>Existence saw him spurn her bounded reign,</L>
<L>And panting Time toil'd after him in vain:</L>
<L>His pow'rful strokes presiding Truth impress'd,</L>
<L>And unresisted passion storm'd the breast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then JOHNSON came, instructed from the school,</L>
<L>To please in method, and invent by rule;</L>
<L>His studious patience, and laborious art,</L>
<L>By regular approach assail'd the heart;</L>
<L>Cold approbation gave the ling'ring bays,</L>
<L>For those who durst not censure, scarce cou'd praise.</L>
<L>A mortal born, he met the general doom,</L>
<L>But left, like Egypt's kings, a lasting tomb.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="201" REF="203"/>
<L>The wits of Charles found easier ways to fame,</L>
<L>Norwish'd for JOHNSON'S art, or SHAKESPEAR'S flame;</L>
<L>Themselves they studied, as they felt they writ;</L>
<L>Intrigue was plot, obscenity was wit.</L>
<L>Vice always found a sympathetick friend,</L>
<L>They pleas'd their age, and did not aim to mend.</L>
<L>Yet bards like these aspir'd to lasting praise,</L>
<L>And proudly hop'd to pimp in future days.</L>
<L>Their cause was gen'ral, their supports were strong,</L>
<L>Their slaves were willing, and their reign was long;</L>
<L>Till shame regain'd the post that sense betray'd,</L>
<L>And Virtue call'd oblivion to her aid.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then crush'd by rules, and weaken'd as refin'd,</L>
<L>For years the pow'r of tragedy declin'd;</L>
<L>From bard to bard the frigid caution crept,</L>
<L>Till declamation roar'd, while passion slept.</L>
<L>Yet still did Virtue deign the stage to tread,</L>
<L>Philosophy remain'd, though Nature fled.</L>
<L>But forc'd at length her ancient reign to quit,</L>
<L>She saw great Faustus lay the ghost of Wit:</L>
<L>Exulting Folly hail'd the joyful day,</L>
<L>And pantomime and song confirm'd her sway.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But who the coming changes can presage,</L>
<L>And mark the future periods of the stage?</L>
<L>Perhaps if skill could distant times explore,</L>
<L>New Behns, new Durfeys, yet remain in store.</L>

<L>The passion's blameless, when the judgment's wise.</L>

<L>Life's secret shade, or open walk is best:</L>
<L>Each has its separate joys, and each its use:</L>
<L>This calls the patriot forth, and that the muse.</L>
<L>Hence not alike to all the species, heav'n</L>
<L>An equal thirst of publick fame has given:</L>
<L>Patrius it forms to shine in action great;</L>
<L>While Decio's talents best adorn retreat.</L>

<L>The vain aspirer, or dishonest great,</L>
<L>Whom love of wealth, or wild ambition's sway</L>

<L>High and more high who aim with restless pride,</L>

<L>For the low lucre of an useless gain,</L>
<L>(Wise but to get, and active but to save)</L>
<L>May scorn deserv'd still follow to the grave.</L>
<L>But he who fond to raise a splendid name,</L>
<L>On life's ambitious height would fix his fame,</L>
<L><PB N="205" REF="207"/>In active arts, or vent'rous arms would shine,</L>
<L>Yet shuns the paths which virtue bids decline;</L>
<L>Who dignifies his wealth by gen'rous use,</L>

<L>Shall reason's voice impartial e'er condemn</L>
<L>The glorious purpose of so wise an aim?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where virtue regulates this just desire,</L>
<L>'Twere dang'rous folly to suppress its fire.</L>

<L>What laurels prompt the hero's useful rage?</L>
<L>What prize the patriot's weighty toils engage?</L>

<L>O! may the Muse inspire the love of praise,</L>

<L>For this she oft has tun'd her sacred voice,</L>

<L>Nor till the summit gain'd, her paths forsake.</L>

<L>Who lives approv'd in Pope's unrival'd lays.</L>

<L>Grave precepts fleeting notions may impart,</L>

<L>Then look on Patrius, let his conduct shew</L>
<L>From active life what various blessings flow.</L>
<L>In him a just ambition stands confess'd;</L>
<L>It warms, but not inflames, his equal breast.</L>
<L>See him in senates act the patriot's part,</L>
<L>Truth on his lips, the publick at his heart;</L>
<L>There neither fears can awe, nor hopes controul,</L>
<L>The honest purpose of his steady soul.</L>
<L>No mean attachments e'er seduced his tongue</L>
<L>To gild the cause his heart suspected wrong;</L>

<L>Now, ev'n now, my joys run high,</L>

<L>Search for peace with all your skill:</L>

<L>ENOUGH of Grongar, and the shady dales</L>
<L>Of winding Towy, Merlin's fabled haunt,</L>
<L>I sung inglorious. Now the love of arts,</L>
<L>And what in metal or in stone remains</L>
<L>Of proud antiquity, thro' various realms</L>
<L>And various languages and ages fam'd,</L>
<L>Bears me remote, o'er Gallia's woody bounds,</L>
<L>O'er the cloud-piercing Alps remote; beyond</L>
<L>The vale of Arno purpled with the vine,</L>
<L>Beyond the Umbrian and Etruscan hills,</L>
<L>To Latium's wide champain, forlorn and waste,</L>
<L><PB N="221" REF="223"/>Where yellow Tiber his neglected wave</L>
<L>Mournfully rolls. Yet once again, my Muse,</L>
<L>Yet once again, and soar a loftier flight;</L>
<L>Lo the resistless theme, imperial Rome.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fall'n, fall'n, a silent heap; her heroes all</L>
<L>Sunk in their urns; behold the pride of pomp,</L>
<L>The throne of nations fall'n; obscure in dust;</L>
<L>Ev'n yet majestical; the solemn scene</L>
<L>Elates the soul, while now the rising sun</L>
<L>Flames on the ruins in the purer air</L>

<L>Fanes roll'd on fanes, and tombs on buried tombs.</L>
</LG>

<L>Deep lies in dust the Theban obelisc,</L>
<L>Immense along the waste; minuter art,</L>
<L>Gliconian forms, or Phidian, subtly fair,</L>
<L>O'erwhelming; as th' immense LEVIATHAN</L>
<L>The finny brood, when near Ierne's shore</L>
<L>Out-stretch'd, unwieldly, his island length appears</L>
<L>Above the foamy flood. Globose and huge,</L>
<L>Grey-mould'ring temples swell, and wide o'ercast</L>
<L>The solitary landskape, hills and woods,</L>
<L>And boundless wilds; while the vine-mantled brows</L>

<L>Eridanus, and Tiber with his twins,</L>

<L>Yet here advent'rous in the sacred search</L>

<L>The toilsome step up the proud Palatin,</L>
<L>Through spiry cypress groves, and tow'ring pine,</L>
<L>Waving aloft o'er the big ruins brows,</L>
<L>On num'rous arches rear'd: and frequent stopp'd,</L>
<L>The sunk ground startles me with dreadful chasm,</L>
<L>Breathing forth darkness from the vast profound</L>
<L>Of isles and halls, within the mountain's womb.</L>
<L>Nor these the nether works; all these beneath,</L>
<L>And all beneath the vales and hills around,</L>
<L>Extend the cavern'd sewers, massy, firm,</L>
<L>As the Sibyline grot beside the dead</L>
<L>Lake of Avernus; such the sewers huge,</L>
<L>Whither the great Tarquinian genius dooms</L>
<L><PB N="223" REF="225"/>Each wave impure; and proud with added rains,</L>
<L>Hark how the mighty billows lash their vaults,</L>
<L>And thunder; how they heave their rocks in vain!</L>
<L>Though now incessant Time has roll'd around</L>
<L>A thousand winters o'er the changeful world,</L>
<L>And yet a thousand since, th' indignant floods</L>
<L>Roar loud in their firm bounds, and dash and swell,</L>
<L>In vain; convey'd to Tiber's lowest wave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hence over airy plains, by crystal founts,</L>
<L>That weave their glitt'ring waves with tuneful lapse,</L>
<L>Among the sleeky pebbles, agate clear,</L>

<L>Cheering the darkness; and deep empty tombs,</L>

<L>Rustick and green and wide-embow'ring shades,</L>
<L>Shot from the crooked clefts of nodding tow'rs;</L>

<L>Above all height: and his own Brutus see,</L>
<L>Desponding Brutus, dubious of the right,</L>

<L>A matron old whom we school-mistress name;</L>
<L>Who boasts unruly brats with birch to tame.</L>
<L>They grieven sore, in piteous durance pent,</L>
<L>Aw'd by the pow'r of this relentless dame;</L>

<L>And work the simple vassals mickle woe;</L>
<L>For not a wind might curl the leaves that blew,</L>

<L>So have I seen (who has not, may conceive,)</L>

<HEAD>THE MAN of TASTE. Occasion'd by an EPISTLE Of Mr. POPE'S on that Subject.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By the Same.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>WHoe'er he be that to a Taste aspires,</L>
<L>Let him read this, and be what he desires.</L>
<L>In men and manners vers'd from life I write,</L>
<L>Not what was once, but what is now polite.</L>
<L>Those who of courtly France have made the tour,</L>
<L>Can scarce our English aukwardness endure.</L>
<L>But honest men who never were abroad,</L>
<L>Like England only, and its Taste applaud.</L>
<L>Strife still subsists, which yields the better goût;</L>
<L>Books or the world, the many or the few.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>True Taste to me is by this touchstone known,</L>
<L>That's always best that's nearest to my own.</L>
<L>To shew that my pretensions are not vain,</L>
<L>My father was a play'r in Drury-lane,</L>
<L><PB N="287" REF="289"/>Pears and pistachio-nuts my mother sold,</L>
<L>He a dramatick poet, she a scold.</L>
<L>His tragic Muse could countesses affright,</L>
<L>His wit in boxes was my lord's delight.</L>
<L>No mercenary priest e'er join'd their hands,</L>
<L>Uncramp'd by wedlock's unpoetick bands.</L>
<L>Laws my Pindarick parents matter'd not,</L>
<L>So I was tragi-comically got.</L>
<L>My infant tears a sort of measure kept,</L>
<L>I squall'd in distichs, and in triplets wept.</L>
<L>No youth did I in education waste,</L>
<L>Happy in an hereditary Taste.</L>
<L>Writing ne'er cramp'd the sinews of my thumb,</L>
<L>Nor barbarous birch e'er brush'd my tender bum.</L>
<L>My guts ne'er suffer'd from a college cook,</L>
<L>My name ne'er enter'd in a buttery-book.</L>
<L>Grammar in vain the sons of Priscian teach,</L>
<L>Good parts are better than eight parts of speech:</L>
<L>Since these declin'd, those undeclin'd they call,</L>
<L>I thank my stars, that I declin'd them all.</L>
<L>To Greek or Latin tongues without pretence,</L>
<L>I trust to mother wit and father sense.</L>
<L>Nature's my guide, all sciences I scorn,</L>
<L>Pains I abhor, I was a poet born.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet is my goût for criticism such,</L>
<L>I've got some French, and know a little Dutch.</L>
<L>Huge commentators grace my learned shelves,</L>
<L>Notes upon books out-do the books themselves.</L>
<L><PB N="288" REF="290"/>Criticks indeed are valuable men,</L>
<L>But hyper-criticks are as good agen.</L>
<L>Tho' Blackmore's works my soul with raptures fill,</L>
<L>With notes by Bentley they'd be better still.</L>
<L>The Boghouse-Miscellany's well design'd.</L>
<L>To ease the body, and improve the mind.</L>
<L>Swift's whims and jokes for my resentment call,</L>
<L>For he displeases me that pleases all.</L>
<L>Verse without rhyme I never could endure,</L>
<L>Uncouth in numbers, and in sense obscure.</L>
<L>To him as nature, when he ceas'd to see,</L>
<L>Milton's an universal blank to me.</L>
<L>Confirm'd and settled by the nation's voice,</L>
<L>Rhyme is the poet's pride, and people's choice.</L>
<L>Always upheld by national support,</L>
<L>Of market, university, and court:</L>
<L>Thomson, write blank; but know that for that reason,</L>
<L>These lines shall live when thine are out of season.</L>
<L>Rhyme binds and beautifies the poet's lays,</L>
<L>As London ladies owe their shape to stays.</L>

<L>Had Cibber's self the Careless Husband wrote,</L>
<L>He for the laurel ne'er had had my vote:</L>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON CONVERSATION.</HEAD>

<LG>
<L>THE art of converse, how to sooth the soul</L>
<L>Of haughty man, his passions to controul,</L>
<L>His pride at once to humble and to please,</L>
<L>And join the dignity of life with ease,</L>
<L>Be now my theme. O thou, whom Nature's hand</L>
<L>Fram'd for this best, this delicate command,</L>
<L>And taught when lisping, without reason's aid,</L>
<L>At the same time to speak and to persuade,</L>
<L>WYNDHAM, with diligence awhile attend,</L>
<L>Nor scorn th' instructions of an older friend;</L>
<L>Who when the world's great commerce shall have join'd</L>
<L>The deep reflection, and the strengh of mind,</L>
<L><PB N="299" REF="301"/>To the bright talents of thy youthful state,</L>
<L>In turn shall on thy better lessons wait.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whence comes it, that in every art we see</L>
<L>Many can rise to a supreme degree;</L>
<L>Yet in this art, for which all seem design'd</L>
<L>By nature, scarcely one compleat we find?</L>
<L>You'll say, perhaps, we think, we speak, we move,</L>
<L>By the strong springs alone of selfish love:</L>
<L>Yet among all the species, is there one,</L>
<L>Whom with more caution than ourselves, we shun?</L>
<L>What is it fills a puppet-show or court?</L>
<L>Go none but for the profit or the sport?</L>
<L>If so, why comes each soul fatigu'd away,</L>
<L>And curses the dull puppets same dull play;</L>
<L>Yet, unconvinc'd, is tempted still to go?</L>
<L>'Tis that we find at home our greatest foe.</L>
<L>And reason good why solitude we flee;</L>
<L>Can wants with self-sufficiency agree?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet, such our inconsistency of mind,</L>
<L>We court society, and hate mankind.</L>
<L>With some we quarrel, for they're too sincere:</L>
<L>With others, for they're close, reserv'd and queer:</L>
<L>This is too learn'd, too prudent, or too wise;</L>
<L>And that we for his ignorance despise:</L>
<L>A voice perhaps our ear shall harshly strike,</L>
<L>Then strait ev'n wit itself shall raise dislike;</L>
<L>Our eye may by some feature be annoy'd,</L>
<L>Behold at once a character destroy'd:</L>
<L><PB N="300" REF="302"/>One's so good-natur'd, he's beyond all bearing,</L>
<L>He'll ridicule no friend, tho' out of hearing:</L>
<L>Another warm'd with zeal, offends our eyes,</L>
<L>Because he holds the mirror up to vice.</L>
<L>No wonder then, since fancies wild as these</L>
<L>Can move our spleen, that real faults displease.</L>
<L>When Maevius, spite of dullness, will be bright,</L>
<L>And teach ABGYLL to speak, and SWIFT to write;</L>
<L>When Flavia entertains us with her dreams,</L>
<L>And Macer with his no less airy schemes;</L>
<L>When peevishness, and jealousy and pride,</L>
<L>And int'rest that can brother hearts divide,</L>
<L>In their imagin'd forms our eyesight hit,</L>
<L>Of an old maid, a poet, peer or cit;</L>
<L>Can then, you'll say, philosophy refrain,</L>
<L>And check the torrent of each boiling vein?</L>
<L>Yes. She can still do more; view passion's slave</L>
<L>With mind serene, indulge him, and yet save.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But self-conceit steps in, and with strict eye</L>
<L>Scans every man, and every man awry;</L>
<L>That reigning passion, which thro' every stage</L>
<L>Of life, still haunts us with unceasing rage.</L>
<L>No quality so mean, but what can raise</L>
<L>Some drudging driveling candidate for praise;</L>
<L>Ev'n in the wretch, who wretches can despise,</L>
<L>Still self-conceit will find a time to rise.</L>
<L>Quintus salutes you with forbidding face,</L>
<L>And thinks he carries his excuse in lace:</L>
<L><PB N="301" REF="303"/>You ask, why Clodius bullies all he can?</L>
<L>Clodius will tell you, he's a gentleman:</L>
<L>Myrtilla struts and shudders half the year,</L>
<L>With a round cap, that shews a fine turn'd ear:</L>
<L>The lowest jest makes Delia laugh to death;</L>
<L>Yet she's no fool, she has only handsome teeth.</L>
<L>Ventoso lolls, and scorns all human kind</L>
<L>From the gilt coach with four lac'd slaves behind;</L>
<L>Does all this pomp and state proceed from merit?</L>
<L>Mean thought! he deems it nobler to inherit:</L>
<L>While Fopling from some title draws his pride,</L>
<L>Meanless, or infamous, or misapply'd;</L>
<L>Free-mason, rake or wit, 'tis just the same,</L>
<L>The charm is hence, he has gain'd himself a name.</L>
<L>Yet, spite of all the fools that pride has made,</L>
<L>'Tis not on man an useless burthen laid;</L>
<L>Pride has ennobled some, and some disgrac'd;</L>
<L>It hurts not in itself, but as 'tis plac'd;</L>
<L>When right, its view knows none but virtue's bound;</L>
<L>When wrong, it scarcely looks one inch around.</L>
<L>Mark! with what care the fair one's critic eye</L>
<L>Scans o'er her dress, nor let's a fault slip by;</L>
<L>Each rebel hair must be reduc'd to place</L>
<L>With tedious skill, and tortur'd into grace;</L>
<L>Betty must o'er and o'er the pins dispose,</L>
<L>'Till into modish folds the drapery flows,</L>
<L>And the whole frame is fitted to express</L>
<L>The charms of decency and nakedness.</L>
<L><PB N="302" REF="304"/>Why all this art, this labour'd ornament;</L>
<L>To captivate, you'll cry no doubt, 'tis meant.</L>
<L>True. But let's wait upon this fair machine</L>
<L>From the lone closet to the social scene;</L>
<L>There view her loud, affected, scornful, sour,</L>
<L>Paining all others, and herself still more.</L>
<L>What means she, at one instant to disgrace,</L>
<L>The labour of ten hours, her much-lov'd face?</L>
<L>Why, 'tis the self-same passion gratify'd;</L>
<L>The work is ruin'd, that was rais'd by pride.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet of all tempers, it requires least pain,</L>
<L>Could we but rule ourselves, to rule the vain.</L>
<L>The prudent is by reason only sway'd,</L>
<L>With him each sentence and each word is weigh'd;</L>
<L>The gay and giddy can alone be caught</L>
<L>By the quick lustre of a happy thought;</L>
<L>The miser hates, unless he steals your pelf;</L>
<L>The prodigal, unless you rob yourself;</L>
<L>The lewd will shun you, if your wife prove chaste;</L>
<L>The jealous, if a smile on his be cast;</L>
<L>The steady or the whimsical will blame,</L>
<L>Either, because you're not, or are the same;</L>
<L>The peevish, sullen, shrewd, luxurious, rash,</L>
<L>Will with your virtue, peace, or interest, clash;</L>
<L>But mark the proud man's price, how very low!</L>
<L>'Tis but a civil speech, a smile, or bow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye who push'd on by noble ardour, aim</L>
<L>In social life to gain immortal fame,</L>
<L><PB N="303" REF="305"/>Observe the various passions of mankind,</L>
<L>General, peculiar, single or combin'd:</L>
<L>How youth from manhood differs in its views,</L>
<L>And how old age still other paths pursues;</L>
<L>How zeal in Priscus nothing more than heats,</L>
<L>In Codex burns, and ruins all it meets;</L>
<L>How freedom now a lovely face shall wear,</L>
<L>Now shock us in the likeness of a bear;</L>
<L>How jealousy in some resembles hate,</L>
<L>In others, seems but love grown delicate;</L>
<L>How modesty is often pride refin'd,</L>
<L>And virtue but the canker of the mind;</L>
<L>How love of riches, grandeur, life, and fame,</L>
<L>Wear different shapes, and yet are still the same.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But not our passions only disagree,</L>
<L>In taste is found as great variety:</L>
<L>Sylvius is ravish'd when he hears a hound,</L>
<L>His lady hates to death the odious sound:</L>
<L>Yet both love music, tho' in different ways;</L>
<L>He in a kennel, she at opera's.</L>
<L>A florist shall, perhaps, not grudge some hours,</L>
<L>To view the colours in a bed of flowers;</L>
<L>Yet, shew him TITIAN'S workmanship divine,</L>
<L>He passes on, and only cries, 'tis fine.</L>
<L>A rusty coin, an old worm-eaten post,</L>
<L>The mouldy fragment of an author lost,</L>
<L>A butterfly, an equipage, a star,</L>
<L>A globe, a fine lac'd head, a china jar,</L>
<L><PB N="304" REF="306"/>A mistress, or a fashion, that is new,</L>
<L>Have each their charms, tho' felt but by a few.</L>
<L>Then study each man's passion and his taste,</L>
<L>The first to soften, and indulge the last:</L>
<L>Not like the wretch, who beats down virtue's fence,</L>
<L>And deviates from the paths of common sense;</L>
<L>Who daubs with fulsome flattery, blind and bold,</L>
<L>The very weakness we with grief behold.</L>
<L>Passions are common to the fool and wise,</L>
<L>And all would hide them under art's disguise;</L>
<L>For so avow'd, in others, is their shame,</L>
<L>None hates them more, than he who has the same.</L>
<L>But taste seems more peculiarly our own,</L>
<L>And every man is fond to make his known;</L>
<L>Proud of a mark he fancies is design'd</L>
<L>By nature to advance him o'er his kind;</L>
<L>And where he sees that character impress'd,</L>
<L>With joy he hugs the favourite to his breast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But the main stress of all our cares must lie,</L>
<L>To watch ourselves with strict and constant eye:</L>
<L>To mark the working mind, when passion's course</L>
<L>Begins to swell, and reason still has force;</L>
<L>Or, if she's conquer'd by the stronger tide,</L>
<L>Observe the moments when they first subside;</L>
<L>For he who hopes a victory to win</L>
<L>O'er other men, must with himself begin;</L>
<L>Else like a town by mutiny oppress'd,</L>
<L>He's ruin'd by the foe within his breast;</L>
<L><PB N="305" REF="307"/>And they alone, who in themselves oft view</L>
<L>Man's image, know what method to pursue.</L>
<L>All other creatures keep in beaten ways,</L>
<L>Man only moves in an eternal maze:</L>
<L>He lives and dies, not tam'd by cultivation,</L>
<L>The wretch of reason, and the dupe of passion;</L>
<L>Curious of knowing, yet too proud to learn;</L>
<L>More prone to doubt, than anxious to discern:</L>
<L>Tir'd with old doctrines, prejudic'd at new;</L>
<L>Mistaking still the pleasing for the true;</L>
<L>Foe to restraints approv'd by gen'ral voice,</L>
<L>Yet to each fool-born mode a slave by choice:</L>
<L>Of rest impatient, yet in love with ease;</L>
<L>When most good-natur'd, aiming how to teaze:</L>
<L>Disdaining by the vulgar to be aw'd,</L>
<L>Yet never pleas'd but when the fools applaud:</L>
<L>By turns severe, indulgent, humble, vain;</L>
<L>A trifle serves to lose him or to gain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then grant this trifle, yet his vices shun,</L>
<L>Not like to CATO or to <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Alcibiades.</NOTE> CLINIAS' son:</L>
<L>This for each humour every shape could take,</L>
<L>Ev'n virtue's own, tho' not for virtue's sake;</L>
<L>At Athens rakish, thoughtless, full of fire,</L>
<L>Severe at Sparta, as a Chartreux fryar;</L>
<L>In Thrace, a bully, drunken, rash, and rude;</L>
<L>In Asia gay, effeminate and lewd;</L>
<L><PB N="306" REF="308"/>While the rough Roman, virtue's rigid friend,</L>
<L>Cou'd not to save the cause he dy'd for bend:</L>
<L>In him 'twas scarce an honour to be good,</L>
<L>He more indulg'd a passion than subdu'd.</L>
<L>See how the skilful lover spreads his toils,</L>
<L>When eager in pursuit of beauty's spoils!</L>
<L>Behold him bending at his idol's feet;</L>
<L>Humble, not mean; disputing, and yet sweet;</L>
<L>In rivalship not fierce, nor yet unmov'd;</L>
<L>Without a rival studious to be lov'd;</L>
<L>For ever fearful, tho' not always witty,</L>
<L>And never giving cause for hate or pity:</L>
<L>These are his arts, such arts as must prevail,</L>
<L>When riches, birth, and beauty's self will fail:</L>
<L>And what he does to gain a vulgar end,</L>
<L>Shall we neglect, to make mankind our friend?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Good sense and learning may esteem obtain;</L>
<L>Humour and wit a laugh, if rightly ta'en:</L>
<L>Fair virtue admiration may impart;</L>
<L>But 'tis good-nature only wins the heart:</L>
<L>It molds the body to an easy grace,</L>
<L>And brightens every feature of the face:</L>
<L>It smooths th' unpolish'd tongue with eloquence,</L>
<L>And adds persuasion to the finest sense.</L>
<L>Yet this, like every disposition, has</L>
<L>Fixt bounds, o'er which it never ought to pass;</L>
<L>When stretch'd too far, its honour dies away,</L>
<L>Its merit sinks, and all its charms decay;</L>
<L><PB N="307" REF="309"/>Among the good it meets with no applause,</L>
<L>And to its ruin the malicious draws,</L>
<L>A slave to all, who force it, or entice,</L>
<L>It falls by chance in virtue or in vice,</L>
<L>'Tis true, in pity for the poor it bleeds,</L>
<L>It cloaths the naked, and the hungry feeds;</L>
<L>It cheers the stranger, nay its foes defends,</L>
<L>But then as oft it injures its best friends.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Study with care Politeness, that must teach</L>
<L>The modish forms of gesture and of speech:</L>
<L>In vain Formality, with matron mien,</L>
<L>And Pertness apes her with familiar grin:</L>
<L>They against nature for applauses strain,</L>
<L>Distort themselves, and give all others pain:</L>
<L>She moves with easy, tho' with measur'd pace,</L>
<L>And shews no part of study, but the grace.</L>
<L>Yet ev'n by this man is but half refin'd,</L>
<L>Unless philosophy subdues the mind:</L>
<L>'Tis but a varnish that is quickly tost,</L>
<L>Whene'er the soul in passion's sea is lost.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Wou'd you both please and be instructed too,</L>
<L>Watch well the rage of shining to subdue;</L>
<L>Hear every man upon his fav'rite theme,</L>
<L>And ever be more knowing than you seem.</L>
<L>The lowest genius will afford some light,</L>
<L>Or give a hint that had escap'd your sight.</L>
<L>Doubt, till he thinks you on conviction yield▪</L>
<L>And with fit questions let each pause be fill'd:</L>
<L><PB N="308" REF="310"/>And the most knowing will with pleasure grant,</L>
<L>You're rather much reserv'd, than ignorant.</L>

<L>The rays of wit gild wheresoe'er they strike,</L>

<L>They charm the lively, but the grave offend,</L>
<L>And raise a foe as often as a friend;</L>
<L>Like the resistless beams of blazing light,</L>
<L>That cheer the strong, and pain the weakly sight.</L>
<L>If a bright fancy therefore be your share,</L>

<L>Usurp the province of the nurse to lull,</L>

<L><PB N="309" REF="311"/>A story should, to please, at least seem true,</L>

<L>Weighs all the niceties of forms and modes;</L>
<L>And makes the rugged paths so smooth and even,</L>

<L>One heav'n-inspir'd invents a frock, or hood:</L>

<L>Far be that thought! but let us now relate</L>
<L>A character as opposite, as great,</L>
<L>In him, who living gave to Athens fame,</L>
<L>And, by his death, immortaliz'd her shame.</L>
<L>Great scourge of sophists! he from heaven brought down,</L>
<L>And plac'd true wisdom on th' usurper's throne:</L>
<L>Philosopher in all things, but pretence;</L>

<L>He, o'er mankind; all Athens was his school.</L>
<L>The sober tradesman, and smart petit-maitre,</L>

<L>He spoke like them, tho' not like them he thought:</L>
<L>Nor wept, nor laugh'd, at man's perverted state;</L>
<L>But left to women this, to ideots that.</L>
<L>View him with sophists fam'd for fierce contest,</L>
<L>Or crown'd with roses at the jovial feast;</L>
<L><PB N="320" REF="322"/>Insulted by a peevish, noisy wife,</L>
<L>Or at the bar foredoom'd to lose his life;</L>
<L>What moving words flow from his artless tongue,</L>

<L>Yet scorn'd to flatter vice, or virtue blame;</L>
<L>Nor chang'd to please, but pleas'd because the same;</L>
<L>The same by friends caress'd, by foes withstood,</L>
<L>Still unaffected, cheerful, mild, and good.</L>
<L>Behold one pagan, drawn in colours faint,</L>
<L>Outshine ten thousand monks, tho' each a saint!</L>

<L>Here let us fix our foot, hence take our view,</L>

<L>We see, when reason stagnates in the brain,</L>
<L>The dregs of fancy cloud its purest vein;</L>
<L>But circulation betwixt mind and mind</L>
<L>Extends its course, and renders it refin'd.</L>
<L>When warm with youth we tread the flow'ry way,</L>
<L>All nature charms, and ev'ry scene looks gay;</L>
<L>Each object gratifies each sense in turn,</L>
<L>Whilst now for rattles, now for nymphs we burn;</L>
<L>Enslav'd by friendship's or by love's soft smile,</L>
<L>We ne'er suspect, because we mean no guile:</L>

<L>For instinct rul'd, when reason should have chose;</L>
<L><PB N="321" REF="323"/>We fly for comfort to some lonely scene,</L>
<L>Victims henceforth of dirt, and drink, and spleen.</L>

<L>For, as upon life's hill we upwards press,</L>
<L>Our views will be obstructed less and less.</L>

<L>Destroy our virtue, or our parts debase;</L>

<L>That 'tis not good for man to be alone.</L>

<HEAD>ADVICE to a Lady in AUTUMN.</HEAD>
<L>ASSES milk, half a pint, take at seven, or before;</L>
<L>Then sleep for an hour or two, and no more.</L>
<L>At nine stretch your arms, and oh! think when alone,</L>
<L>There's no pleasure in bed.—MARY, bring me my gown:</L>
<L>Slip on that ere you rise; let your caution be such;</L>
<L>Keep all cold from your breast, there's already too much;</L>
<L>Your pinners set right, your twitcher ty'd on,</L>
<L>Your prayers at an end, and your breakfast quite done;</L>
<L>Retire to some author, improving and gay,</L>
<L>And with sense like your own, set your mind for the day,</L>
<L>At twelve you may walk, for at this time o' the year,</L>
<L>The sun like your wit, is as mild, as 'tis clear:</L>
<L>But mark in the meadows the ruin of Time;</L>
<L>Take the hint, and let life be improv'd in its prime.</L>
<L>Return not in haste, nor of dressing take heed;</L>
<L>For beauty, like yours, no assistance can need.</L>
<L>With an appetite, thus, down to dinner you sit,</L>
<L>Where the chief of the feast is the flow of your wit:</L>
<L>Let this be indulg'd, and let laughter go round;</L>
<L>As it pleases your mind, to your health 'twill redound.</L>
<L>After dinner two glasses at least, I approve;</L>
<L>Name the first to the king, and the last to your love:</L>
<L><PB N="329" REF="331"/>Thus cheerful with wisdom, with innocence gay,</L>
<L>And calm with your joys gently glide thro' the day.</L>
<L>The dews of the evening most carefully shun;</L>
<L>Those tears of the sky for the loss of the sun.</L>
<L>Then in chat, or at play, with a dance, or a song,</L>
<L>Let the night, like the day, pass with pleasure along.</L>
<L>All cares, but of love, banish far from your mind;</L>
<L>And those you may end, when you please to be kind.</L>

<HEAD>On a Lady drinking the Bath-Waters.</HEAD>
<L>THE gushing streams impetuous flow,</L>
<L>In haste to DELIA'S lips to go,</L>
<L>With equal haste and equal heat,</L>
<L>Who would not rush those lips to meet?</L>
<L>Bless'd envy'd streams, still greater bliss</L>
<L>Attends your warm and liquid kiss.</L>
<L>For from her lips your welcome tide</L>
<L>Shall down her heaving bosom glide;</L>
<L>There fill each swelling globe of love,</L>
<L>And touch that heart I ne'er could move.</L>
<L>From hence in soft meanders stray,</L>
<L>And find at last the blissful way</L>
<L>Which thought may paint, tho' verse mayn't say.</L>
<L><PB N="330" REF="332"/>Too happy rival dwell not there</L>
<L>To rack my heart with jealous care,</L>
<L>But quit the blest abode, tho' loth,</L>
<L>And quickly passing, ease us both.</L>

<HEAD>VERSES written in a LADY'S SHERLOCK upon Death.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>MIstaken fair, lay Sherlock by,</L>
<L>His doctrine is deceiving;</L>
<L>For whilst he teaches us to die,</L>
<L>He cheats us of our living.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To die's a lesson we shall know</L>
<L>Too soon without a master;</L>
<L>Then let us only study now</L>
<L>How may we live the faster.</L>

<L>To live's to love, to bless, be blest</L>
<L>With mutual inclination;</L>
<L>Share then my ardour in your breast,</L>
<L>And kindly meet my passion.</L>

<HEAD>SONG.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHEN Fanny blooming fair</L>
<L>First caught my ravish'd sight,</L>
<L>Struck with her shape and air,</L>
<L>I felt a strange delight:</L>
<L>Whilst eagerly I gaz'd,</L>
<L>Admiring ev'ry part,</L>
<L>And ev'ry feature prais'd,</L>
<L>She stole into my heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In her bewitching eyes</L>
<L>Ten thousand loves appear;</L>
<L>There Cupid basking lies,</L>
<L>His shafts are hoarded there,</L>
<L>Her blooming cheeks are dy'd</L>
<L>With colour all their own,</L>
<L>Excelling far the pride</L>
<L>Of roses newly blown.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Her well-turn'd limbs confess,</L>
<L>The lucky hand of Jove;</L>
<L>Her features all express</L>
<L>The beauteous queen of love:</L>
<L><PB N="332" REF="334"/>What flames my nerves invade,</L>
<L>When I behold the breast</L>
<L>Of that too charming maid</L>
<L>Rise, suing to be press'd!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Venus round Fanny's waist,</L>
<L>Has her own Cestus bound,</L>
<L>With guardian Cupids grac'd,</L>
<L>Who dance the circle round.</L>
<L>How happy must he be,</L>
<L>Who shall her zone unloose!</L>
<L>That bliss to all, but me,</L>
<L>May heaven and she refuse.</L>

<L>WHenever, Chloe, I begin</L>
<L>Your heart like mine to move,</L>
<L>You tell me of the crying sin</L>
<L>Of unchaste lawless love.</L>
</LG>

<L>How can that passion be a sin,</L>
<L>Which gave to Chloe birth?</L>
<L>How can those joys but be divine,</L>

<L>To wed, mankind the priest trepann'd,</L>
