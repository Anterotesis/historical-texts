<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>As far as this interesting TRIAL. has gone, it has been conducted with that rigid impartiality which so particularly distinguishes the various Courts of BRITISH JURISPRUDENCE!—How it may ter∣minate can be known only to the ruler of these great events: indeed, from the contrariety of weighty evidence already advanced, and the cloud of testimonies yet to be adduced, it would be highly indecorous, to indulge even a conjecture upon the probability of its decision!!</P>
<P>The COURT have wisely resolved to sit without further adjournment, in order now to receive at their Bar, the evidence of the first POLITICAL, and LI∣TERARY Characters, against whom, exceptions were so ingeniously taken by Council, but which however have all been most constitutionally over-ruled. These
<PB N="viii" REF="6"/>
being gone through, the sage and learned POLONIUS in person, will sum up the whole evidence, and after delivering a solemn and eloquent charge from the Bench, receive from the GRAND INQUEST, that VERDICT. which no doubt, will soon tend to the complete administration of LITERARY JUSTICE, by setting this GREAT QUESTION at rest for ever!!!</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="introduction">
<P>PENDING the distinguished inquest under which the fact is now trying, whether the newly discovered DRAMA, is, or is not from the pen of SHAK∣SPEARE, it would be highly indecorous to hazard a single conjecture upon it.—The EDITOR, therefore, will content himself with merely giving a faithful transcript of all that has been successively recorded on this important subject in that fashionable Intel∣ligencer the MORNING HERALD: only remarking, that whatever may be the final issue of the TRIAL, the passages selected from the Piece itself by the se∣veral
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
VOTERS, <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con.</HI> must remain indelible proofs of the discriminative taste of those, who have here so characteristically enrolled themselves in de∣fence of our BELLES LETTRES.</P>
<P>The following is the paragraphical CHAIN by which this great Literary Concern has been brought into such general notice; viz.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="paragraph">
<HEAD>PARAGRAPH.</HEAD>
<P>The SHAKSPEARE <HI>discoveries,</HI> said to be made by the son of Mr. IRELAND, of Norfolk-street, are the Tragedy of LEAR, and another entitled VOR∣TIGERN and ROWENA, now first brought to light, and both in the Bard's own hand-writing:—in the same chest are said to have been also found an antique MELANGE of <HI>love letters!—professions of faith!—billet doux!—locks of hair!—and family receipts!—</HI>The only danger, respecting <HI>faith in the discovery,</HI> seems to be from the indiscretion of <HI>finding too much!</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
If poor CHATTERTON had contented himself, with drawing literary treasure in <HI>moderation</HI> from the monkish chest of ROWLEY, his own <HI>inventive genius</HI> had probably remained unknown!</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="paragraph">
<HEAD>ANOTHER.</HEAD>
<P>Mr. IRELAND's Tragedy of VORTIGERN, whe∣ther sterling, or fictitious, is to go to <HI>Drury-lane.</HI> Mr. SHERIDAN, says, <Q REND="inline">"it is the finest play that SHAKSPEARE ever wrote!</Q>—not that he has had leisure yet to read it—but he had it from an autho∣rity as classical, and unquestionably as his own judg∣ment; viz. the solemn assurance of the great Lord SALISBURY himself, a <HI>Critic,</HI> only six removes, by lineal descent, from Mr. SHERIDAN's own immor∣tal BURLEIGH!</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. EDITOR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Your SHAKSPEARE correspondents know but little of what is going forward in the <HI>mine of disco∣very!</HI> Lord, Sir, if they wish to get at the <HI>whole truth,</HI> they must dip <HI>deep</HI> into the <HI>old chest,</HI> as the an∣cients did into the <HI>Pierean</HI> well!—indeed they are not correct even in what they have stated. For in∣stance,—the <HI>precious</HI> LOCK OF HAIR! how comes it, they were so ignorant, as not to know, that Mr. <HI>Justice</HI> COLLICK, the first <HI>Hair Merchant</HI> in the universe, has critically inspected it, and, re∣gardless of the <HI>sacred head</HI> of <HI>fiction</HI> from whence it was shorn, he, as a <HI>man of business,</HI> could only be brought to say, that if the whole <HI>string</HI> were as good as the <HI>sample,</HI> it was worth no more in the <HI>trade,</HI> than 3s. 9d. an ounce?—The pointed distich on the envelope, however, as his Grace of LEEDS declares, is worth a million!—Here it is:
<Q><L>"Ere Age with twinge your nerves doth shocke,</L>
<L>"Catch Love, like Time, by the forelocke!"</L></Q>
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
By which our annotators will no doubt tell us, that the <HI>Warwickshire</HI> WAG quaintly inculcates the youthful libertinism of—<HI>catch, as catch can!</HI>—Among the more recent treasures, are a moth-eaten <HI>under</HI> PETTICOAT, an undoubted <HI>original!</HI> Mr. MALONE, who, with all his ability, knows but lit∣tle about <HI>petticoats,</HI> says, this could be no part of the paraphernalia of the immortal Bard;—but Mrs. PIOZZI, and the whole <HI>Blue Stocking Club,</HI> are de∣cidedly of a contrary opinion, and that for the best of all feminine reasons; viz. because Miss HATH∣AWAY, when she became Mrs. SHAKSPEARE, ne∣ver failed to <HI>wear</HI> the BREECHES!—we have also Mr. <HI>Boswell's</HI> authority for this, amongst other <HI>domestica facta</HI> of the Poet. The next curiosity for the <HI>amateurs,</HI> is, a <HI>love</HI> VALENTINE, surrounded, according to antient usage, with <HI>hearts! cupids! doves!</HI> and <HI>darts!</HI> and in the centre, a <HI>typifying</HI> figure of a <HI>cock</HI> without a <HI>combe,</HI> (according to an∣tique spelling) with this inexplicable <HI>anagram:</HI><Q><L>"If to my armes you'll fondlye roame,</L>
<L>"Despighte of <HI>Dadde,</HI> I'll cut your <HI>Combe!</HI>"</L><BIBL>W. S.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="12"/>
From this, some of the inspecting <HI>Literati</HI> are cruel enough to infer, that SHAKSPEARE must have had an <HI>intriguc</HI> with the daughter of his ancient enemy <HI>John a</HI> COOMBE,—the undoubted ancestor of the present <HI>Opposition</HI> ALDERMAN, who has the honour of bearing that distinguished name!</P>
<P>The last MORCEAU I shall treat you with at this time, is selected from the RECEIPTS, viz.<Q>"A RECIPEE <HI>howe to make a</HI> GOODLIE PLUMBE PUDINGE."</Q></P>
<P>Even Mr. STEEVENS admits the unquestionable authenticity of this valuable addendum to the <HI>cull∣nary art,</HI> by declaring, that Shakspeare could not endure the <HI>stones</HI> of plumbs, which, from setting his <HI>teeth on edge,</HI> were called <HI>jar</HI> raisins; and literally gives an appropriate citation of the following pas∣sage, from the Poet's <HI>own words,</HI> which will cer∣tainly be received as the best <HI>glossary</HI> to his <HI>own plumb pudding:</HI><Q>"SYLVUS.—Put <HI>dates</HI> enough into the bag: but, dearest chuck, I prithee make me <HI>geldings</HI> of the PLUMBES!"</Q></P>

<P>We have it from high authority, that the merits of the great question, respecting the originality of the <HI>newly</HI> discovered PLAY, are put into a train of investigation, before a LITERARY COURT of EN∣QUIRY, which cannot fail of the most candid, and judicious decision:—It will be managed under the auspices of an illustrious personage, who fortunately unites in his <HI>singular</HI> character, all the critical and judicial talents, requisite for so solemn a disquisition!</P>

<P>IT is with much concern we announce, that the PROCESSION, preparatory to opening the Literary Court of Inquest, to try whether this DRAMA is, or is not written by SHAKSPEARE, was obliged to be suspended till Wednesday by an unpleasant acci∣dent. <HI>Signor</HI> DELPINI, that man of <HI>mighty mouth,</HI> who was to have walked as <HI>Champion</HI> to a PRODI∣GIOUS COURTIER, unfortunately dislocated his <HI>jaw bone</HI> in practising an <HI>Aristocratic Grin,</HI> in compli∣ment to his illustrious Patron!—However, the <HI>Sieur</HI> FOLLET, almost equally great in the happy distor∣tions of the human countenance, has kindly under∣taken this interesting part, and to be ready in it, that day at noon, when this introductory spectacle will certainly take place, and our readers be no longer kept in a state of anxious expectancy!</P>

<P>AS soon as the Court was opened with all due for∣malities, the DANISH CHAMBERLAIN, Lord POLONIUS, arose, and gracefully made an obei∣sance to <HI>himself</HI> in a spacious Mirror, which was instantly returned by a figure of similar dignity, from this STATE REFLECTOR, dexterously placed in the front of the CHAIR, that his Lord∣ship might have the judicial advantage of seeing what he <HI>himself</HI> was about, which no other person in the Court could ever know, or possibly divine!—The <HI>Sieur</HI> FOLLET, as Chamberlain's <HI>Grand</HI>

CHAMPION, then gigantically advanced, and after throwing down his gauge, and thrice brandishing his <HI>Herculean Club,</HI> affixed a written PROCLA∣MATION to its butt, when placing the smaller end on the bridge of his nose, the following pre∣liminary CHALLENGE became visible to all around; <HI>viz.</HI> <Q REND="inline"><P>"If any one present dare gainsay, that the Lord POLO∣NIUS is the most <HI>witty!</HI> most <HI>wise!</HI> most <HI>valorous!</HI> most <HI>eloquent!</HI> most <HI>disinterested!</HI> most <HI>beloved!</HI> most <HI>puissant!</HI> most <HI>chaste!</HI> let him come forth, and I, the unworthy <HI>Champion</HI> of that mighty Lord, will tell him, that he lyes in his teeth; and, from my furious wrath the Lord deliver his miserable carcase!!?"</P></Q></P>
<P>[Here an enraged <HI>Musician</HI> indignantly advanced, with an intent, as was supposed, to take up the glove: but was prevented, in being humanely knocked down by one of the <HI>Beef-caters.</HI>]—A nod manda∣tory was now given from the Chair as a cue to the principal <HI>Harlequin,</HI> who, waving his dagger of lath over a richly inlaid tablet, a pair of folding doors of ophir flew open, and discovered an irra∣diating glory of aethereal blue and gold, darting its
<PB N="15" REF="21"/>
transcendent beams on the <HI>Title Page</HI> of an antique volume in quarto, curiously filligreed, and fretted with <HI>moths</HI> and <HI>earwigs,</HI> and entitled
<Q>VORTIGERN AND ROWENA;</Q></P>
<P>On Harlequin waving his lath a second time, a light coloured cloud gently descended to a soft strain of Aeolian measure, which opening, displayed a scrowl with this Inscription—<Q><L>Ye, of the School of <HI>Nature,</HI> as of <HI>Art,</HI> draw near,</L>
