<P>YOU are absolutely too ef∣feminately scrupulous, CARLISLE—what I proposed was well meant. However, as your virtue is of a most obstinate, anchoretical nature, which neither love nor friendship can make a voluptuous
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>impression upon, I shall quit the subject; but not without saying, that you are a very singular man; and I question, upon the whole, whether the sex like you a bit the better for those scruples which stand so constantly betwixt you and a delicious offer.</P>
<P>As to Miss DE GREY, it is as im∣possible she can love such a flash in the pan, such a match always lighted, as MEDWAY, as it is impossible for her to live in the same house with CLEMENT CARLISLE, and not be (however se∣cretly) in raptures with him—that is to say—if his <HI>ice</HI> does not lie in the way.

<HEAD>LETTER LIV. From the Same to Sir ANDREW FLIGHT.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear ANDREW,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE stratagem takes: I have written the letter we projected, and it answers our expectation. He could not bear the idea—he was hurt—he could not believe his eyes—he would not do her such a violence for the world— But you knew his virtue. I judge it is owing in a great degree to my caution in directing to you in a <HI>counterfeit</HI> hand, that has kept our correspondence so long as private as we wished it; for, had I written in my usual character, a single letter would have betrayed me
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>to CARLISLE, with whom I have lived on terms of absolute intimacy for ten years, without his ever suspecting me to be a <HI>jolly</HI> fellow. So easy is it for men of spirit, to impose upon these mighty good kind of men. Never, surely, was any thing half so a-propos, as his putting the Marchioness under my care—or rather my sister's, who really thinks me as great a saint as CARLISLE himself. But to come to the point, it may certainly be contrived for you to take unto your bosom this Italian trea∣sure—CARLISLE refuses her, that's one plea—you are a fine fellow, that's ano∣ther—you have money, that's greater than even the former: her passions are awake, that's number 4 in your fa∣vour: she is married, and therefore above the folly of sollicitation—num∣ber 5—her constitution glows like the torrid zone—number 6—She abhors
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>the Marquis—count <HI>nine</HI> for that. In short, she will, she must, she <HI>shall</HI> be your's—As to the arrival of the Mar∣quis, do not apprehend any danger from that quarter: I have counteracted the contents of the letter from CAR∣LISLE, you may depend on it. It is, by your LASCELLES, so ordered, that, if he goes at all in search of his <HI>Perdita,</HI> he will not direct his course to England, but to a very different quarter of the globe. I will prepare every other grand essential, even till your bed is dressed with roses. In the mean time keep HEATHCOATE ignorant of the bu∣siness, and continue to use, or rather to amuse <HI>him,</HI> with the <HI>ridiculous</HI> that re∣sults from your play upon the HODSONS, DREWSONS, HEWSONS—what the plague is their vulgar name? He is a worthy fellow, but not fit for <HI>such</HI> a plot as the
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>present—therefore till the deed be done, keep him out of it.</P>
<P>As to the Lady's beauty, depend on your old caterer for that. I have a hawk's eye at a pretty wench. To say the truth, the Marchioness is more to your taste than any I have had the ho∣nour and friendship to recommend. Her eyes have just that fluid floating in them, and are exactly of that brilliant black you like: her nose is turned to the perfection of <HI>your</HI> beauty—a little on the aquiline, and set off by a pair of brows so markingly expressive of plea∣sure, that you may depend upon them. Then her lips is first of that superior order, without corpulence, and so full of majesty, without haughtiness, that most attaches you. Her bosom is finely filled, and rises, as the poet emphatically
<PB REF="8"/>terms it, "suing to be pressed." Her arms, hands, fingers, are, likewise, all suited to you. But enough. She is to be the subject of a much closer criti∣cism than it is even possible for me to give.</P>
<P>Once more, however, let me charge you, by an old and serviceable friend∣ship, never to breathe the name of LASCELLES in any way not consistent with every thing sacred. You know my loss of a damned fortune at one stroke of the die, first reduced me to this. As it was impossible to hold <HI>still the elbow,</HI> something was necessary to repair my mischance, and, literally speaking, keep me <HI>in play:</HI> besides which, I was to live as I had ever been used to do; I was to be the same cha∣racter. Two paths presented them∣selves,
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>the one led to the gallows by the way of purse-gathering, the other to the accommodation of a friend, by the way of <HI>woman.</HI> I saw <HI>you,</HI> loved you, valued your <HI>health,</HI> and chose the latter path. You know how I have suc∣ceeded: let the ample catalogue of your passions, gratified in every form, con∣vince you of it. You <HI>only</HI> I served: you only know me to be not absolutely— a CARLISLE. I once more repeat to you the necessity of burning every letter, and every slip of paper you get from me, the moment it comes to hand: if a syllable at any time transpires, I am destroyed for ever: the consequence of which irreparable injury is, that I must cut your throat. But keep our counsel and you shall be the very Jupiter of a seraglio.</P>

<P>THOUGH BLESSINGBOURNE has not yet honoured my last draughts, and I have but just an hundred pieces about me, I, nevertheless, divide chear∣fully with you—My purse is your's— How canst talk so childishly about dis∣closure of secrets? Could you not have me cut into piecemeal by fathers, bro∣thers, aunts, mothers, and cousins, if I were ridiculous enough to blab? I adore woman to <HI>please</HI> me, and men to <HI>laugh</HI> at. <HI>You</HI> very liberally supply
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>me with the one kind of gratification, HEATHCOATE with the other. Neither jars with the other's province, and I have money enough to support you both. As to character, I like it as well as you, and except laughing at men, and lying with women, I solemnly declare I would not do a wrong thing for the world. But every man to his pas∣sions—those are mine. You rejoice my heart with repeating to me in every letter the personal charms of CARLISLE's fair follower. 'Tis a confounded thing though, to consider she is so taken with CARLISLE; and yet to do him justice, he is an elegant, glorious fellow. Every day marks the goodness of his heart, and you would be an ingrateful dog to say a syllable against him. If you can <HI>prevent all risque</HI> (for though you fight for me, I hate quarrels) I will be satis∣fied with your success by the middle of
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>next month. In the mean time I have a game of my own to play. Just such a one as I can manage without assistance. Not a snap of the finger of peril at∣tending the whole enterprise. But, HEATHCOATE is my correspondent in this adventure; it is not of <HI>importance</HI> enough for the ambitious GEORGE LASCELLES, whom even a Marchioness cannot deter from his attempts: the ob∣ject of my present humble aspiring is only the wife of the most grazier-looking HAL. HEWSON. But mum, not a word more on a subject that does not belong to you. HEATHCOATE is the man for trifles and laugh. MEDWAY is, as usual, the most sullen rascal in Europe; he was going to run me through the body the other day for tossing down a tumbler of fair water, which (though I swear it was an accident) he insisted was done with an ill-natured design to spot
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>his waistcoat—CARLISLE, who is ever a peace-maker, interfered, or else I should most likely have written to you from Elysium.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LVII. Captain CARLISLE to Mr. LASCELLES.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH your last relished more, my dear LASCELLES, of the <HI>inconsiderate</HI> than I hope belongs to your character, yet it set my heart at rest upon the subject of the Marchioness.</P>
<P>Another strange circumstance has happened in this family. Two days after I had returned such a reply to Mr. DE GREY's letter as appeared to me proper and consistent, he put into my hands a letter from BLESSINGBOURNE, who had made formal overtures of marriage betwixt Miss DE GREY and Sir ANDREW FLIGHT. Nothing ever
<PB N="17" REF="18"/>excited more real astonishment, for I had never once dreamt of a treaty coming from that quarter, knowing, so per∣fectly as I do, LUCIA's <HI>opinion</HI> of Sir ANDREW. The epistle was penned with all the title-swelled vanity connected with the BLESSINGBOURNE character; and coronets, crests, and supporters, lions rampant, spread eagles, and fields azure, danced through every line. Having commented upon the style, with a good humour, which is above turning the re∣sult of a man's infirmity into a cause of affront, Mr. DE GREY asked me my opinion of the match—</P>
<P>Pray heaven, I may never undergo so severe a trial as I sustained in the process of the following short but most agonizing conversation, of which, you will have the more perfect idea from
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>dialogue. It past in Mr. DE GREY's library.</P>

<P>I have ever made you, my dear Mr. CARLISLE, my confident upon various occasions: we have never canvassed to∣gether a <HI>love affair.</HI> Though you tell me <HI>you</HI> are to have a little more know∣ledge of society, before you venture upon a wife; yet I know you to have a very competent judgement of these things, because you have ever been an accurate observer. This letter be∣fore us, opens to you a secret of the utmost consequence to your friends. Peace. What do you think of it?</P>

<P>At any rate I will decline his Lord∣ship's offer. I am persuaded, LUCIA has no sort of affection for Sir ANDREW. He is too light, too volatile.—Now, <HI>that</HI> objection does not, I think, lie

<HEAD>LETTER LVIII. Mr. DE GREY to the Earl of BLES∣SINGBOURNE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE importance of the con∣sideration to both the young parties concerned, and the regard that is due to the natural inclinations, as to the acquired affections, are the apologies I have to offer for <HI>appearing</HI> to neglect a suitable return of acknowledgment for the honour of your Lordship's letter, and for the ample proposals it contained.</P>
<P><HI>Prior</HI> to the receipt of your Lord∣ship's favour, I made some attempt to
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>obtain the secret of my child's heart, and <HI>since,</HI> I have made a like attempt upon the heart of <HI>another</HI> person. Not, my Lord, that it is possible for me to prefer any gentleman to the nephew of the Earl of BLESSINGBOURNE, but be∣cause I suspected an affection subsisting elsewhere: I think, my Lord, I have discovered a passion in my daughter, and a <HI>return</HI> of it in a certain young friend of mine, that may, possibly, grow, in a little time, into a circumstance of essential consequence.</P>
<P>Within a few days I shall be more assured of this, and if my child proves to have a heart not pre-engaged, there can be no doubt of her soon becoming sensible of the great honour of an al∣liance with so near a branch of the BLESSINGBOURNE family. On the con∣trary, if it should turn out that her af∣fections
<PB N="28" REF="29"/>are already possessed, it will appear obvious to your Lordship, that, as, in such a case, she cannot reward the tenderness of Sir ANDREW, she can have no just title to the many dignities, and the immense fortunes which would follow such a union.</P>
<P>What I would invite then from your Lordship, is, a short <HI>suspension,</HI> that the matter may lie open. I again re∣peat, that a few days will naturally determine every thing. In the mean time, Sir ANDREW had better, I con∣ceive, remain unacquainted with our treaty, left it should any way terminate to his dissatisfaction. On <HI>my</HI> part, I will hasten the necessary discovery as much as in my power, although your Lord∣ship will easily imagine, a father's power, in a point of so much importance, is not very extensive, when the father
<PB N="29" REF="30"/>is convinced of his child's integrity and discretion.</P>
<P>I shall be happy, my Lord, to hear, that the mode, I have submitted to your Lordship, is crowned with your ap∣probation.</P>
<P>I <HI>distinguish</HI> myself when I present my most humble compliments to the Countess, and I have the honour to be,</P>

We offered the most peculiar splendours, we offered lineal

I shall not mention the clear annual rent-roll of near fifty thousand guineas a year, that will de∣volve to him, nor will I rest my conse∣quence upon the superbest equipage; nor on the most magnificent seats in Europe; I confine myself to that illustrious line, into which the arms of your young Lady would be, if I may so say,—<HI>encoated.</HI> Every body can tell, Mr. DE GREY, I am not a boaster; but, indeed, your tardy conduct borders somewhat upon incivility and disrespect.

<HEAD>LETTER LXII. Sir ANDREW FLIGHT to Mr. HEATH∣COATE.</HEAD>
<P>HERE is a fine piece of work cut out, HEATHCOATE. Aunt and uncle have resolved to marry me to LUCIA DE GREY. The old foolish Lord hath sent me a letter which set me laughing for a whole hour. He bids me look upon the damsel as upon the happy she who is to be the <HI>cara sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sa</HI> of Sir ANDREW FLIGHT. He bids me prepare for marriage—mar∣riage, HEATHCOATE? If I ever mar∣ry—why then—But, by the sacred souls
<PB N="39" REF="40"/>of all the Lords, Barons, Farls, Dukes, Dutchesses, Popes, Cardinals, Kings, and Grand Monarques, that went be∣fore me, I will turn this event to some pleasant advantage. I say pleasant, be∣cause to think upon it <HI>seriously,</HI> is quite and clean out of the question. LUCIA DE GREY is too modest, yet too aweful, and too much—a thousand times too much, hovered over by a set of cut∣throat fellows, who would slice me and eat me, were I to pretend to the serious fact. And between ourselves, I believe both CARLISLE and MEDWAY are in her train.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Charming Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is impossible to have been so long burning under the torrid rays of your transporting beams of beauty, without becoming sensible to their piercing—heart-piercing fervour. As well might the tender bud lie on the shore of India, without being parched by the favours of Apollo—a titled gen∣tleman now at my elbow, but whose name I am not yet entitled to disclose, is, as it were, my guardian genius, and tells me, that you, charming Madam,
<PB N="43" REF="44"/>have within these few days been pleased, out of the benignity of your gracious self, to speak of my parts and person with some <HI>condescending complacency.</HI> This emboldens me, charming Madam, to say, that I think you are the most in∣comparable piece of <HI>celestial workman∣ship in the way of woman,</HI> that ever glowed under the astonished eyes of a small spectator—the natural consequence of all this, Madam, is, that I am the humblest of your idolaters. I find, charming Madam, met in you, all the graces which Horace, Pliny, Homer, Virgil, and all other writers, ancient or modern, give to their several favourites. Your lips are sweeter than those at∣tributed to Briseis—your hair has more of the <HI>nitidus</HI> in it, than belonged to <HI>that</HI> which was the distinguishing pro∣perty of the divine Lyce's, and your <HI>air</HI> is considerably more ennobled than
<PB N="44" REF="45"/>that of the majestic Dido, Queen of Carthage, celebrated in the Aeneid written by Virgil.</P>
<P>I should never, charming Madam, have presumed to address such ambi∣tious sentiments to your exalted ele∣gance, were I not told that you prefer scientific superiority to personal per∣fection. Some persons have been pleased to flatter me with possessing pretty fully the laurels of the <HI>first</HI> excellence; and as to the <HI>last,</HI> though nature hath not endowed me altogether with the graces of a CARLISLE, yet I find in my glass an alteration somewhat for the better every day, and hope in the end to <HI>step</HI> without any kind of embarrass∣ment.</P>
<P>I take love-secrets to be amongst the <HI>sanctum sanctorum</HI> of <HI>arduus rebus,</HI> and therefore I beg <HI>this</HI> may be confined

<HEAD>LETTER LXIV. Mr. HENRY HEWSON to Mr. HEATH∣COATE, Esq.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Esquire,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE not <HI>catched</HI> up goose feather for some time, Case why? be∣cause I was amind to gee time for the perfaction of the thing—I am got a woundly way since my last, and fancy a couple o'weeks more will finish me, that is, if Sir ANDREW sticks close by me, and I continues to <HI>practise</HI> the thing—Case why? <HI>practise</HI> makes parfect. To shew you that I ha' not been silent for nothing, I must let you know that
<PB N="47" REF="48"/>I ha'n't chang'd ten words with HETT. this week. Case why? what's so far from the goe of the genteel gig, as to take notice of one's houshold spouse be∣fore company? 'specially when a body is learning a <HI>touch of the times.</HI> To say truth, her lips looked develish ruddy <HI>t'other</HI> day, and I lent um a smack that echoed like waggon whip—for I could not help it, seeing that's she's one of your dainty ones—but Sir ANDREW soon took me aside, and ga' me a bit of a lesson, and made me heartily ashamed <HI>on't.</HI> I must let you know too, that I manage my little bit of a <HI>black sack</HI> bobbishly, <HI>thof</HI> ribbons and flourri∣diddles at sides tickle nape o' one's neck consumedly. Neither do I look so damn'd ugly as might be surspected, regard to frenchfied foretop, and hair-bundles stuck out side of one's head. Fat of
<PB N="48" REF="49"/>one's feace helps to take of hugeness of thing, which is but natural, seeing that <HI>one</HI> swells out <HI>t'other;</HI> and this makes feace and hair go, as a man may say, cheek-by-jowl without quarreling. It's pity, I'm given to <HI>sweattin</HI> so much, as I find it don't do at all for a better-most person. I ha' got half dozen fine white handkerchiefs, but they're so cussed <HI>cambrickey</HI> that they are nothing in such a <HI>grepe</HI> as mine, and I melt so this fmoaking weather, that I make '<HI>em</HI> every mother's son quite of a stew. Truth is, I begin to see, <HI>plite∣ness</HI> has, like every thing else, 'vantages and not 'vantages. When I was an ignoramus, I used to sit in hall, or ride to hayfield with nightcap on head, or coloured handkerchief under hat for 'vantage of dripping in summertide; but no such matter <HI>now;</HI> there's nothing
<PB N="49" REF="50"/>so ill-bred as to be caught <HI>sweattin;</HI> nay, more than that, 'tis quite out of the goe of the thing to <HI>mention</HI> the very word—'tis <HI>sweattin</HI> with fellers of yesterday, but, I find, 'tis <HI>presfieration</HI> with folks that are obliged to be <HI>desunt.</HI> Sir ANDREW has been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t me some time (seeing I can't keep this <HI>presfieration</HI> to myself) to bleed and bolus for six weeks or so, that I may vacuate some of my <HI>moister,</HI> and dry up my porusses abit. What do <HI>you</HI> think of this, Esquire? I hate purgers as I hate <HI>Lucifer—Satan∣cotus,</HI> as Gab calls him, but I would even <HI>potecarryarize</HI> myself for sake of good breeding. To tell you the truth, there is sort of a pleasant comical <HI>nothing∣at-all,</HI> in the life of your better-most genii, that I like mortationly well in∣deed. I warrant you, we went it round the great garden last night by moon∣shine
<PB N="50" REF="51"/>for two hours—none but your tip-top specie, giggling and going it all the time—clack—clack—clack— yes—yes—yes—no—no—no—ha! ha! ha!—he! he! he!—ti-tum, ti-tum—ti∣ti-dum—Pardon me, Madam—pardon me, Miss—<HI>Skuse</HI> me, Sir—out with the foot—off with the hat—down with the breech—oh Esquire—Esquire HEATH∣COATE, 'tis just the thing to a T. Last night, a little afore we went awalkin, I finished <HI>giving the hand,</HI> as they call it—that is to say, getting a pretty lady over a gutter, for instance—or handin her over a puddle, or any thing the same way—allowing for th'alteration. I was once, before I had my fortune, low enough to say on such <HI>cassion,</HI> Come Bet, Het, Pol, Mol, Fan, Kit, or what not—allowing for the alteration— Come, gee us your fist, or tip us your
<PB N="51" REF="52"/>daddle—or lends hold o' your fore∣foot, else may hap you may draggle the tail o' you in the water. Odds merciful miserecordibus! as Gab says, no such thing now by a million. <HI>Contrary</HI> so much, that one of the best things a better-most body <HI>can</HI> do, is to manage this matter as't should be. Sir ANDREW himself, for sample, is the greatest dabster in the world at it. For instance, <HI>there's</HI> he, <HI>there's</HI> a woman, and <HI>there's</HI> a crossing, or a slippihin of waterwash; mayhap, we'll say, covered o'er with stepping stones—<HI>Now</HI> mark, Esquire. Now comes your jemmy work—Well— get over they must—Indulge me, Miss, or Madam, or my Lady, says he, allowing for th'alteration, with the favor of your fair hand—Sir, you are very <HI>plite.</HI> Well—what's next? Whew— she's a t'other side. But how the misere∣cordibus
<PB N="52" REF="53"/>did she get there I wonder, says you? Ah! there lies the point. Now I'll tell you. First, Miss, &amp;c. allowing for the alteration, tucks up piece of petticoat, sets her pretty foot on stepping stone, shews dainty turn'd ancle, and is obliged, for the sake of better∣most breedin, to look a little as if she was scar'd. Oh, Lord—says she—Fear not, dear creature, divine angel, noble Madam, magnanimous Miss, &amp;c. al∣lowing for the alteration—fear nothing: then, Esquire, he <HI>takes</HI> her hand, and <HI>takes</HI> her waist, and gis her a <HI>querrick,</HI> and they <HI>take</HI> a little bit of a thing 'twixt a hop and a jump, and he kisses her glove, and bends hinder-part, and bows head, and gets grin into's feace, and gis a bit of he, he, he, and shews his white, powder-purg'd grinders, and—and—'tis all over as neat as the
<PB N="53" REF="54"/>Lady's leg: I ha' been a long while on this head, case 'tis almost half way clean up to the top genii, and Sir ANDREW 'clares 'pon his honour, no gentleman can do long without it—I ha' practis'd hugely, and I find I am up to every part of the puddle-pliteness, 'cept <HI>pousing</HI> out hinder-part, and getting the grin. In aiming at the first matter, I ha' overset one of Master DE GREY's china jars; for the thing is natural. I a'n't made quite so plite as I should be 'bout the bottom of waist, or mayhap a little bit farder, so it's out of the ques∣tion for me to wriggle't as little and limberly as such a fine genteel, grey∣hound-ham'd son of a gentleman as Sir ANDREW. The grin too is, as I just now said, a hard thing to hit off. I can't, for soul of me, find out any thing to make a man laugh at getting
<PB N="54" REF="55"/>a woman over a cartret, and as to laughing where one don't see the joke, and where the thing is one almost nothing at all, I never could do it since I was born. Besides, why? I am so cuss'd <HI>covered</HI> about the gills, that if I could laugh as heartily as Sir ANDREW, 'twould not do, for my cheeks are too <HI>solidum firmus,</HI> if a man chose to be learned, that it's enough to crack one's cheek furniture. I begin to day to learn to hold my tongue, or else talk about nothing, just as cassion sees fit. Hett gets on at a pure size. Sir AN∣DREW is giving her a lectur about airs, and high notions, fan-fluttering—hem∣ming, and the like, now in the garden. Gab would do very well if his larning did not stand in his way. But we shall all be fit to be seen in a short time, be∣fore we go back; tho' as to coming
<PB N="55" REF="56"/>near Captain CARLISLE, that's impos∣sible: yet I am sure he never took any pains to be better-most, for every thing he does looks too easy for that—same thing with Miss LUCIA.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXV. Mrs. HEWSON to Sir ANDREW FLIGHT.</HEAD>
<P>YOU assure me there is no∣thing more common, than for elegant people to write to each other, while they are under the same roof. You propose Lord and Lady SHUTTLECOCK, of your acquaintance, as examples, who, you tell me, when even they are chagrin'd, retire to their chambers, and keep the waiting-woman upon the hurry-scurry, with carrying notes of reproach to and fro, for several hours. Well, I pro∣test, I wish the practice were universal, for it's mighty pretty; but <HI>then,</HI> indeed, it would become vulgar, and after that, it would <HI>nauseate.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="58"/>
Miss LUCIA is so filled with spleen and megrim, that there is no getting an answer out of <HI>her.</HI> As to corre∣sponding with <HI>you,</HI> Sir ANDREW, whom I <HI>see</HI> every hour, what can I possibly have to say? If you wish me upon paper, as well as in person, to assure you, that I most cordially detest—detest <HI>every thing,</HI> that was once most charm∣ing, I <HI>will</HI> repeat it. No truth was ever clearer. Those lasses, who were favourites formerly in my village, are <HI>now</HI> as detestable to me as the village itself. I was once so great a novice as to find pleasure in seeing my rustic neighbours walk in their Sunday dresses with their happy homely husbands, and assemble in the shade. My foolish heart leapt as they sat singing at their doors, or working at their windows—the very <HI>hollo—how-do-you,</HI> and <HI>hail-fellow-well∣met,</HI> had all attractions for me—The
<PB N="58" REF="59"/>smell of an hay-cart was pleasure, and the sight of an harvest-home absolute extacy. Note the alteration: I am wholly <HI>inverted</HI> in point of pleasure: if, on my return to Helter-Skelter-Hall (which is fitting up) I feel any satis∣faction from the sight of people work∣ing at windows, or singing at doors, it will be upon account of the pride of comparing <HI>their</HI> grovelling situation with <HI>mine:</HI> if I bear the noise of an hay∣cart, it will be only from reflecting that my <HI>carriage-horses</HI> (for such I will have) shall fare the better for it.—If I can again reconcile to myself the presence of lads and wenches <HI>dizened</HI> out in their foolish finery, it will only be for the joy of my sweeping by them in magni∣ficence, that shall make them shy off with amazement: and if an harvest∣home can ever more become supporta∣ble, it will only be from the consi∣deration
<PB N="59" REF="60"/>that it comes but once a year, and is then over for a twelvemonth— What other arguments can I use to convince you of my readiness to adopt the modes and manners you speak of?— As to Mr. HEWSON—he is a very good creature, and, when you have done with him, I shall love him better than ever. I cannot come into your opinion about the <HI>elopement</HI> you speak of, be it ever so fashionable; for I most assuredly <HI>do</HI> love Harry, and therefore it is impossi∣ble. Your assertions of <HI>tenderness</HI> to me, I am to take, you know, as mere effects of sentiments which are to come <HI>of course,</HI> and as such, they are very gallant. I shall not, indeed, be in any degree angry with you for the continuance of such civilities in the way of promoting breed∣ing. Nor will I scruple any thing so accomplished a gentleman proposes, ex∣cept the elopement scheme, which, I
<PB N="60" REF="61"/>again say, I can never consent to. Any thing else I obey—nay, I have con∣vinced you of it. I do not speak to Harry <HI>before company;</HI> I walk and step as different as possible from what I did— I perceive the absolute necessity of only occasionally <HI>hearing</HI> and <HI>seeing:</HI> I find every now and then as violent a desire to faint, after a little decent walking, as Lady BLESSINGBOURNE herself.—I was almost expiring with the smell of violets last night <HI>in my room,</HI> though I used to doat on them. I can drink two glasses, and <HI>exactly</HI> another half, of wine and water—My dinners, of late, never digest, without a drop of ratasia. Those drops, and restoratives, which I before never heard of but in <HI>books,</HI> are now a part of my existence. I can bear no smells but such as are <HI>artificial.</HI> Every thing <HI>natural</HI> actually turns upon my stomach. I used to rise at six, I
<PB N="61" REF="62"/>am now never up till near twelve.—I used to let my arms brave the sun∣beams—I now sleep in gloves.—I used to defy the tan, I now never venture to stir without a shade.</P>

<P>IF I described to you, in my last, a scene that was painful, I have now one to relate that is dreadful. Mr. DE GREY again desired to-day a con∣ference with me—Miss DE GREY was to partake of it—Ten minutes <HI>before,</HI> we had met, accidentally, in the garden, and, after a moment's pause of con∣fusion, parted precipitately by different walks.—This' <HI>second</HI> interview, there∣fore, came upon us before the anxiety occasioned by the first had worn off. Our disorder became exceedingly visible, and neither of us spoke for a minute, though during that minute it was the
<PB N="68" REF="69"/>elaborate design of both to speak— Have you not received a <HI>letter?</HI> said Mr. DE GREY to LUCIA.</P>
<P>A letter, Sir! said she, trembling.</P>
<P>Yes, my dear, from—</P>
<P>From Miss LASCELLES, do you mean, Sir? Oh, yes, I had one this day—</P>
<P>NO, LUCIA, I mean from the Earl of BLESSINGBOURNE.</P>
<P>From Lord BLESSINGBOURNE, papa?</P>
<P>[Here, LASCELLES, <HI>I</HI> rose as if to withdraw.]</P>
<P>Pray, Mr. CARLISLE, don't leave us: no business can happen at <HI>this house,</HI>

<P>No, indeed, Sir.</P>
<P>Nor from the Countess?</P>
<P>Yes, Sir—I—I must confess, I <HI>am</HI> honoured with one from the Countess.</P>
<P>May I see it?</P>
<P>If I have it about me, Sir—but I am afraid—oh, no—here it is.</P>
<P>Read it to us, my dear girl; we know what the Countess can do—and I have, I believe, the fellow of it.</P>
<P>Excuse me, Sir, I have got a terrible cough. If you please, I will leave it with you and Captain CARLISLE.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="71"/>
Pray, my best LUCIA, don't stir— <HI>Come,</HI> CLEMENT—here, take <HI>my</HI> letter too, and read <HI>both</HI> to us—</P>
<P><HI>I,</HI> Sir?—</P>
<P>Then, <HI>I</HI> will.</P>
<P>[Here, LASCELLES, he read, first, the Earl's, and then that of the Countess; upon which I had the rashness to ex∣claim—I am not very apt to give way to my indignation; but, if I had here that <HI>scoundrel</HI> Lord, who can suffer his wife to insult <HI>such</HI> a woman as Miss DE GREY, I'd twist his nose off!]</P>
<P>Oh, my dear LASCELLES, what a scene ensued. LUCIA turned pale— fixed her eyes upon me, in a kind of gentle reproach, and, after making an effort to retire, she fell lifeless on the
<PB N="71" REF="72"/>floor. God of Heaven! what did I feel at that moment?—She continued to rise, only to faint again—I kneeled down—I caught her in my arms—My tears bathed her beautiful hand—I stag∣gered under the weight of her, through enfeebling agony—Her dear lips qui∣vered—I leaned down in my confusion, even till I felt <HI>her</HI> cheek upon <HI>mine</HI>— I kissed the tears away—Her father was speechless—She revived a little, but again relapsed, and without alarming any other part of the house (which her delicacy desired might be the case) she was conducted by Mr. DE GREY into her apartment. He is still by her side—I went out in an agony, and I write this in the same situation. What can possibly be the meaning of all this?—Is <HI>Sir Andrew</HI> then at last the man?—Was she so <HI>violently</HI> hurt at my menace against Lord BLESSINGBOUNE?
<PB N="72" REF="73"/>Does her passion extend to the very <HI>roots</HI> of the family? What then be∣comes of <HI>Medway?</HI> Whatever be the truth—it is certain that LUCIA DE GREY is wretched, and therefore it is impossible the most poignant misery should be escaped by the unfortunate</P>

<P>THERE is infinite difficulty in the business—The Marchioness be∣gins to rave about her confinement, which, without the presence of CARLISLE, is, she says, insupportable. She raves— she stamps—she insists upon seeing him. Thirteen love letters have I destroyed since yesterday morning, which she imagines I was fool enough to send to CARLISLE—One written since upon the same subject, I preserve just to send you by way of specimen—All the glorious fire which she expresses there, shall, in due time, burn for you—I— GEORGE
<PB N="77" REF="78"/>LASCELLES, the successful, have said it. My sister has written twice to Miss LUCIA of late—She always gives me her packets to put in the office—Not knowing but she might say something improper of the violent Marchioness, I threw the aforesaid packets, not into the office, but into the fire—My head and hands are full, but the Lady is beyond every thing that was ever before seen on this side Heaven; and so I shall go through it with spirit for the sake of my beloved Baronet.</P>
<P>I have been thinking that a few new <HI>trinkets</HI> might soften a hard place or two;—she came unaccommodated, you know. If you were to supply this matter, you might, perhaps, get her <HI>vanity</HI> in your favour—that is a won∣derful point gained. When <HI>afterwards</HI> she came to know, that one of the

<HEAD>LETTER LXXV. Sir ANDREW FLIGHT to Mr. HEATH COATE.</HEAD>
<P>FIRE and faggot, HEATH∣COATE, what a desperate conclusion had my cursed love of laugh like to have brought me to! You remember my promise of turning uncle's love-letter to advantage—yes, faith, I had like to have made a pretty advantageous piece of business of it truly!—Within an hair's breadth of being drowned, that's all! Wanting some employment, as I told you, to amuse the time, be∣twixt four o'clock, and Mrs. H—'s appointment, I must needs swagger away into the garden, where I knew
<PB N="84" REF="85"/>MEDWAY, the monster, had just with∣drawn with his angle. He was standing with his eyes fixed intently upon the line, greedily devouring the dancing cork upon the stream, when I passed by on the opposite side, as not seeing him. The Earl's letter was in my hand—I appeared to be tickled to the soul. I affected to hold my sides with the pain of laughing. I mentioned the name of <HI>Lady</HI> LUCIA thrice with rapture. My hero threw down his fishing-rod, and coming round to me with inconceivable violence, and the most scarlet visage you ever beheld, even more <HI>a flame</HI> than a setting sun, he cries out—Puppy, jackanapes — what did you frighten away my fish for? the largest carp that ever was seen nibbled that moment at my bait. Had it not been for you I should have hooked him. What <HI>name,</HI> likewise, was that I heard you mention?—
<PB N="85" REF="86"/>it sounded like LUCIA—What letter is that?—give it me this moment.—There is a plot on foot.—Hush, my dear, give it me.</P>
<P>If my uncle insists upon it, OLLY, said I, how the devil can I help it?</P>
<P>Insists upon what? replies he.</P>
<P>Upon my being married, replied I.</P>
<P>Married! to whom?</P>
<P>To Miss LUCIA, that <HI>is</HI>—<HI>Lady</HI> LUCIA that shall be—Countess of BLESSING∣BOURNE, that might have been— Dutchess of DOWNDERDALE, that may be!</P>
<P><HI>What</HI> LUCIA? retorted the savage.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="87"/>
Are there then more heavens than one heaven? — more LUCIA DE GREY's than one LUCIA DE GREY? said I, with great intrepidity, taking snuff.</P>
<P>I will read every syllable of that letter before I suffer you to move—I'll not be sported with, Sir ANDREW.</P>
<P>Nay, I am all upon honourable terms. There are no secrets—'Tis to be a public affair, OLLY. There is the letter for thy inspection.</P>
<P>He took it hastily.</P>
<P>While he was swallowing the con∣tents, up came Captain CARLISLE, but, seeing us engaged, with his usual po∣liteness was going to take another part of the garden. As if from some se∣cret impulse, that <HI>worse</HI> was at hand,
<PB N="87" REF="88"/>I beckoned him. He walked towards me.</P>
<P>So then you are a fellow who make pretensions to Miss DE GREY, are you?</P>
<P>I did, by no means, like a certain ill-look about his eyes, and therefore replied mildly—As to that, my dear OLLY, you may easily see it was all my uncle's doing—My uncle, you see—</P>
<P>Your uncle be damned, replied he. Have you written to the Lady your∣self?</P>
<P>Written to the Lady, my dear OLLY? written to the Lady?—why, as to a letter to the Lady—</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="89"/>
Look ye, Sir ANDREW, as I know you don't run into danger, I shall not hurt you; but I must just inform you, casually, that for equivocating you are a most abominable coward; and as to the matter of daring but to <HI>think</HI> of Miss LUCIA—hush—hush—my dear, say no more upon that subject—I shall be satisfied with giving you to the fish, that's all—</P>
<P>At the close of this speech, he caught hold of my arm, and would absolutely have twirled me souse into the pond, had not CARLISLE ran briskly to my rescue, and saved me from the bar∣barian's fury. He even told CARLISLE that he <HI>insulted the fishes</HI> by saving me, and then walked away growling like a lion.—Poor CARLISLE seemed to be sadly out of spirits, and when he had rescued me, bowed with his wonted
<PB N="89" REF="90"/>elegance as if I had done <HI>him</HI> the fa∣vour, and walked dejectedly away.</P>
<P>Such, HEATHCOATE, has been my <HI>fun</HI>—however, bad luck now, better hereafter, says the proverb. To con∣vince you that I have a bolder heart than you imagine, I will in despite of events go this moment to Mrs. H—; for my watch tells me 'tis exactly the time.</P>

<P>MY misery increases every moment—I am scarce able to hold the the pen—CARLISLE still avoids me most assiduously—yet it is a generous senti∣ment of <HI>his,</HI> that has reduced me to the state in which I have for some time been involved. My father has been several times on the point of making particular enquiries; but so great a simpleton am I, that, whenever he takes hold of my hand and begins to press it to his bosom, I tremble from head to foot, and he is deterred from speaking. I am certain
<PB N="93" REF="94"/>my heart will break, if an alteration does not soon take place. <HI>Medway</HI> has again this minute been aiming his moon∣struck mysteries at me. Coming out of my chamber, I saw him upon the stair-case.

<P>WORSE and worse, HEATH∣COATE. Disappointment again and again—Within the breadth of an hair of my perdition! The charming Mrs. HEWSON was at the bower two minutes after me.</P>
<P>"Punctual as lovers to the moment sworn," said I—Well, charming pupil, are you now convinced that—</P>
<P>I am convinced, said she, Sir AN∣DREW, that you ought to be contented with the many innocent freedoms I
<PB N="98" REF="99"/>allow, without pressing me to grant any thing criminal.</P>
<P>Fie, child, when shall I persuade thee to throw off entirely all those Helter-Skelter-Hall ideas! — Believe me, women of true taste and fashion are above such grovelling, homespun no∣tions—Pleasure is the word with per∣sons that are truly polite; and the plea∣sures I speak of, are the most indis∣pensible. Take my word for it, you can only be a better sort of Plebeian, unless you admit of them—Commence then, I implore you, the true woman of the <HI>ton</HI> at once, and make your Sir ANDREW happy—Nay then, if you refuse me, I must take the fashionable liberty gently to <HI>force</HI> compliance.</P>
<P>To force compliance?—is it really your intention to dishonour me?—Stand
<PB N="99" REF="100"/>off, Sir; you insult me—I am certain it is no derogation to a woman of fashion to be true <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o her husband—and if it <HI>were, that</HI> is a part of the <HI>ton</HI> I shall never aspire to: to speak the plain fact, Sir ANDREW, this last action and con∣versation has given me a very poor opinion of—</P>
<P>I caught hold of her again—</P>
<P>She threw me from her, and gave a shriek—But what of that?—to make the matter ten times more terrible, her exclaiming arroused the ear of the pen∣sive <HI>Carlisle,</HI> who was sitting not far off. Never saw I such manly menaces upon the brow of mortal. <HI>His look</HI> awed me more than the loudest threats of the terrific MEDWAY—Fie, Sir ANDREW, said he, (when the Lady was walking off in pretty confusion)—Is this well
<PB N="100" REF="101"/>concerted? Must you violate the laws of hospitality, at the very time that you seduce simplicity?—Fie upon it!—I am not one, Sir ANDREW, who pique my∣self upon breaking in upon the private revellings of the libertine; but the ground you <HI>now</HI> tread upon, is conse∣crated by belonging to <HI>your friend</HI>— If that, Sir, has no weight with you, I must add something to its force, by informing you, that it is the property of <HI>my</HI> guardian.</P>
<P>Saying this, he gave a gentle incli∣nation of his head, and passed on.</P>
<P>Oh, HEATHCOATE, HEATHCOATE, how diminutively was I shrunk up; how despicably was I dwindled after his departure? I sat a little while under the agony of being the subject of my own ridicule. Annihilation just
<PB N="101" REF="102"/>then would have been a blessing, and I sneaked into the house at last, as me∣lancholy a mite as even crawled upon the earth. To finish the matter, CAR∣LISLE treated me at supper, as if nothing had happened.</P>

<P>THE fellows that hovered over my house have disappeared, and I take up the pen again in more quiet to speak upon the subject of the run∣away Marchioness. Ah, what a line of success was I in, if my cursed pas∣sion had not made it crooked!—But there was no possibility of resisting the temptation—I saw the lovely creature in so many different positions—This moment she dropt upon her knee to call blessings on her CARLISLE—the next she sprung up and execrated her fatal partiality. 'Twas in vain, under such circumstances, to attack her in
<PB N="103" REF="104"/>my <HI>own</HI> person — She looked — she loved—she existed only in CARLISLE. What was to be done? <HI>Stratagem</HI> as∣sisted — I counterfeited the hand of CARLISLE—made, in his name, a so∣lemn appointment to meet her <HI>with Mr. Lascelles' permission</HI>—Enjoined a sacred league of reciprocal silence during the midnight visit—was punctual to the assignation—assumed the murmurs of CARLISLE'S mellifluous voice, and was received with rapture—Felicity was be∣fore me—<HI>but</HI> I was interrupted even at this very moment, just as the heaven of beauty was in prospect; it was con∣trived by some demon, that detests me, to occasion a <HI>stumble</HI> as I was stepping along the apartment. By appointment, no lights were to be admitted—but this unfortunate stroke soon introduced <HI>one,</HI> and it was brought in the hand of my very sister. The Marchioness was fixed
<PB N="104" REF="105"/>in astonishment—I knew not which way to stir—The rest is too painful to re∣peat—We left AUGUSTA in her cham∣ber, but about an hour after we were departed, (my sister to weep, and I to curse myself) I heard somebody go softly down stairs, and presently tam∣pering at the bars of the street-door— I followed the impulse of my suspicions, and hurried down also—You are not to be told it was the Marchioness—I be∣sought her to return—Without con∣descending to reply, she proceeded in her efforts: upon my interfereing a second time, she exclaimed, in a voice, that at once terrified and commanded me—"Villain, set me at liberty!"—I was fool and idiot enough to <HI>obey</HI> her— She rushed into the street like lightning, and, being habited in her boy's apparel, ran along unsuspected.</P>

CAROLINE does nothing but upbraid— One thing is, the Marchioness has no idea of CARLISLE's address—At all events, I must weather it out—Perhaps all may again be well—Whatever folly you commit, let not the cursed lusts of the flesh get the better of your policy.</P>

I have dispatched a line to CARLISLE, which, I hope, will keep all quiet, till, by some means, I can recover the Marchioness—But, at pre∣sent, I have not had courage to step over my own threshold since the cursed accident happened. One thing consoles
<PB N="126" REF="127"/>me not a little: I perceive two papers, which I <HI>purposely wrote, forged,</HI> and <HI>dropt</HI> in AUGUSTA's apartment, are—be∣yond my expectation, as she went away in the night — pickt up. As she knows not CARLISLE's address in the country, and is, I believe, without much money—she may be tempted to return. On the other hand, if these scheming papers have fallen into my sister CA∣ROLINE's possession, it is worse still.— However, at all events, I take care no letters shall go <HI>out</HI> or come <HI>into</HI> my house without my knowledge. Yet, I suspect, that CAROLINE receives letters left for her at some other place—I know not what to think. The cursed uncer∣tainty too of the Marquis's journey, either to <HI>my</HI> place of direction, or to CARLISLE's, much encreases my anxiety. Ah! HEATHCOATE, HEATHCOATE,
<PB N="127" REF="128"/>what a hell it is to be liable to so many terrible apprehensions! O guilt, guilt, guilt!</P>

<P>[Previous to LASCELLES's receipt of the Captain's last].</P>
<P>I DID not, my dear Captain, write to you again upon the subject of the Marchioness; since, I judged, you would take it for granted, that, if any thing <HI>more</HI> unlucky had happen'd, I should immediately have informed you: add to which, I was very unwill∣ing — unless absolutely necessary — to multiply those attentions, which are em∣ploying your generous heart at Pru∣dence-Place. I am astonished at the Marquis's delay. Your letter must have
<PB N="129" REF="130"/>miscarried. Is it not adviseable to write another? London is as barren and burning as Arabia Deserta this horrid hot weather: I would not have you obliged to pass your summer here for any consideration. Not a single soul of <HI>your</HI> acquaintance will be seen here these three months. For my part, I am tied by the foot. Business, you know (agency, my dear friend) must be minded. By-the-by, I must, once more, draw upon your kindness (that bank which is, I think, never to be overdrawn!) a friend of mine wants 200l. for two months, can you spare it?

I could have explained much conciser, had I not chosen to make the appointment that is to determine the thing in <HI>writing.</HI> But there is too much company to speak upon certain subjects that shall be nameless—hush—hush. The sun gets up by four o'clock at this time of the year. Shall we rise there∣fore to morrow or the next day morning, and so contrive to have the business all done and over before the unconcerned part of the family are stirring? No noise—no noise—set your foot lightly— set your foot lightly—who's the wiser, who's the wiser?—hush—hush—hush. You understand me. I will give you this with my own hand: do you do

<HEAD>LETTER XC. Captain CARLISLE to Mr. LASCELLES.</HEAD>
<P>PITY me, my dear LAS∣CELLES, pity me! Never—no, never was man so beset by temptations! MEDWAY drew me, a little while since, in his fly way, to the very farthermost end of the room, and in the softest whisper told me, that—O misery, Mr. LASCELLES!—he should have the ring upon LUCIA's finger in less than three days. "Hush—hush—said he, 'tis the greatest in the world—the poor girl is quite sick upon my delay—She chides me with her looks, every time I see her. I cannot even have leisure enough to put to death the uncle and nephew—
<PB N="138" REF="139"/>They must live till the beginning of the week—Pray pardon me for that, my dear friend. <HI>One</HI> would have <HI>sunk</HI> if you could but have let him alone— Poor LUCIA, longer delay would cer∣tainly kill her!—Three days has she, already, kept her chamber—Mum— Mum—No noise—I have the thing that will settle the business in my pocket."</P>
<P>This conversation was, like all his discourse, in set, solemn sentences—Mr. DE GREY, with an air of sadness upon his venerable brow, came into the room, and we parted.</P>
<P>Oh LASCELLES, help me to lan∣guage—help me to sentiments which de∣scribe sensations of horror, that I may transmit to you some idea of the feel∣ing that took hold of my heart, when
<PB N="139" REF="140"/>I beheld MEDWAY put, as if by stealth, into the hand of Mr. DE GREY, a paper that seemed to be stampt with several seals!—Though it was too much like a <HI>letter,</HI> and too <HI>small</HI> to be a settlement, yet my fancy suggested it was some <HI>deed</HI> sufficient to <HI>my</HI> destruction—</P>
<P>Had not water been at hand, I should certainly have dropt.</P>
<P>To swell the circumstance, both the HEWSONS and Sir ANDREW FLIGHT were in the room.</P>
<P>This was not all. Mr. DE GREY seemed to receive the packet with plea∣sure, and retired rather abrupter than he was wont to do, when he leaves a com∣pany.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="141"/>
MEDWAY hummed a love sonnet, and capered about the room; passing by me every now and then with a wink.</P>
<P>The trial was too hard to be sup∣ported. I withdrew. What was to be done? It was plain that Sir ANDREW's affair was out of the question; <HI>Med∣way—Medway only,</HI> was the man. For <HI>Medway</HI>—the cruel—(ah! why do I call her cruel?)—the <HI>charming</HI> LUCIA DE GREY was now languishing in her chamber: for <HI>him,</HI> she had been long indisposed—<HI>his</HI> image it was that filled her thoughts—<HI>his</HI> person it was that charmed her eyes—<HI>he</HI> only was—to— to—</P>
<P>I lost my senses, LASCELLES—and I now lose them again at the recollection of what followed these reflections.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="142"/>
LUCIA DE GREY herself appeared. She came tottering from her apartment, with a countenance, which, although ever lovely, denoted infinite emotion.</P>
<P>Oh Mr. CARLISLE, said she, lifting up both her hands, what is doing above in the library?</P>
<P>Doing, my dear Miss DE GREY, replied I, (as we walked into the garden, whither she was going to air) you frighten me—why—<HI>what is</HI> doing?</P>
<P><HI>Ceremony</HI> (said she, in the most faulter∣ing voice) for what could my father so loudly repeat the word <HI>ceremony,</HI> Mr. CARLISLE?</P>
<P><HI>When</HI> was that, my dear Miss DE GREY? Your DEAR Miss DE GREY, CLEMENT—ah! that—I beg pardon,
<PB N="142" REF="143"/><HI>Madam</HI>—Habits are unconquerable—I beg pardon—I say, <HI>Miss De Grey</HI>—</P>
<P>My God, Mr. CARLISLE!—I had no such idea—no such—How can you <HI>use</HI> me so, Mr. CARLISLE?</P>
<P>Madam?</P>
<P>Perverseness!—I say, Mr. CARLISLE, I am not conscious of any conduct, that— that—should warrant—such treatment— such treatment, Mr. CARLISLE, as I— I—have received from—from—</P>
<P><HI>Treatment,</HI> Miss DE GREY—treatment— my—my—treatment have you received? what! <HI>ill</HI> treatment?—O hasten to tell me <HI>when, how, where,</HI> by <HI>whom</HI>—then see, my—my <HI>dear—dear</HI>—then, <HI>Ma∣dem,</HI> I say, see if I will brook it!— Has Sir ANDREW, has Mr. <HI>Medway?</HI>—
<PB N="143" REF="144"/>but I ask pardon, Madam, my zeal has hurried me into language which, as things are circumstanced, must naturally offend you.</P>
<P>It does, indeed, Sir—It seems studied to do <HI>more</HI> than offend me—to break my heart.</P>
<P>Your heart, Miss DE GREY!—I have done—I shall—I, I—have done—I wish you—I wish you, very happy— Indeed I do—Upon—upon my soul, Madam, I do!—</P>
<P>Happy, Mr. CARLISLE!—oh bar∣barous!—Give me leave to go in—I wish I were dead!—I have business up∣stairs, Sir—Happy, happy—you wish me happy; and yet you talk in these ungenerous terms of one who—who
<PB N="144" REF="145"/>has been such an <HI>old friend</HI>—oh, Mr. CARLISLE, how can you use me so?</P>
<P>Upon these words she went again into the house in anger and agony inexpres∣sible. But who could ever have sug∣gested that her passion for that strange man, should have made her so sensible of the slightest impression against his character? His very <HI>name,</HI> pronounced in a loud voice, sets her on flame— An old friend—ungenerous to an <HI>old</HI> friend—To be sure I have known Mr. MEDWAY some time—I have—But why do I argue upon the subject?—Every moment makes my disappointment more manifest—Why then am I perplexing my heart with constant attempts to ex∣plain <HI>what,</HI> if I was not wilfully blinded, is as clear as the light of Heaven? The only wise part—the only <HI>possible</HI> part for me now to act, is, directly to
<PB N="145" REF="146"/><HI>withdraw.</HI> Perhaps the morrow may <HI>compleat</HI> my misery. Mr. DE GREY is now, even now, adjusting the <HI>ceremony</HI>— The very ring is before me. Were I to stay longer, I should not be able to answer either for my truth or my ho∣nour. Oh LUCIA—LUCIA—LUCIA!— I can no more.—</P>

<P>CONSCIOUS, dear Mr. MED∣WAY, of no sort of offence; but, on the contrary, feeling for you the same warmth of friendship as usual, I am not a little surprised at the turn and colouring of the sentiment in your last letter. I have now puzzled over it a great while, without being in any mea∣sure rewarded for my pains. To speak the whole truth, I do not comprehend one sentence of your whole favour. You seem to be agitated, and desirous of performing certain ceremonies with peculiar privacy, at a very early hour of the morning: and yet I cannot con∣ceive
<PB N="147" REF="148"/>of what nature those ceremonies should be; nor, if they are of an hostile complexion, can I suggest to myself, whence they should happen.

<P>JOY, joy, HEATHCOATE—I—I I have recovered my lost treasure—re∣covered her, though by compulsion—I caught her upon the look-out for Cap∣tain CARLISLE; and as good luck would have it, scarce ten minutes before old limping GEOFERY, the Captain's fa∣vourite footman, <HI>arrived</HI> with a letter from his master.—I am ready to leap out of my skin; though, as to the Lady herself, never did I see such a dreadful alteration: her visage pale, her eyes dim, her air languid—She scarce seems to have taken refreshment since her
<PB N="160" REF="161"/>escape—Though my sister kneels down and presses her, with tears, to eat, she most obstinately refuses. What a violent woman! I gave it out to two fellows, whom I had upon the scout, that she was a relation of mine, hurt in her senses, who had broke from us. Her behaviour to them, on being seized, justi∣fied this; for, in getting her up stairs to her old apartment, she took a little pocket-knife from her side, and aimed it with full force at one of the men's throats.

<P>Captain CARLISLE to Mr. LASCELLES.</P>
<P>THE strangest as well as the most sudden alteration has happened in the affairs at Prudence Place that you can possibly imagine. Oh, my LAS∣CELLES, I am lighter than the air—the dead weight is taken from my bosom— I have neither a thorn in my heart, nor a wrinkle on my brow. Though the path that led to this paradise was not without brambles that <HI>obstructed,</HI> it pre∣sented, at <HI>last,</HI> the smoothest, the most lawny, as well as the most rosy prospect in the world.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="164"/>
You shall hear.</P>
<P>Unable, any longer, to bear the in∣creasing perplexities of my situation, I wrote a letter of excuse to Mr. DE GREY for a week's absence, and went to pay my farewell respects to LUCIA.</P>
<P>Suggesting what might be the state of my feelings at the close of such an interview, I took care to have my car∣riage waiting for me at the door the moment I left her apartment—nor did I even <HI>allow</HI> myself this pleasure of entering her apartment at all, till I had pre-invited <HI>Mr. De Grey</HI> to be present, and even till I had <HI>apprized Mr. Med∣way</HI> of the sole purpose of my visit.</P>
<P>I meant only to make—my <HI>heart ach</HI>—and withdraw.—Oh human na∣ture!—</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="165"/>
Mr. DE GREY opened the door to me; he had scarce entered himself— Behind him stood—MEDWAY, making his salutations to LUCIA, who, upon seeing me advance, put on, as of late had been usual, a sort of <HI>anxiousness,</HI> which I have been but too apt to con∣strue in my <HI>disfavour.</HI></P>
<P>LUCIA DE GREY looked, as if she thought it a <HI>strange meeting.</HI></P>
<P>"Pray sit down, gentlemen," said she, in a fluttering manner—"Pray sit down."</P>
<P>Her father took her by the hand. I was preparing to speak on the subject of my departure—but could, for the soul of me, get no farther than—"I am come, Madam—I am come, Miss DE GREY—I am—I am come"—</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="166"/>
"Very true, Captain," replied Mr. DE GREY, taking me up briskly, "you are come extremely apropos—you are come just in time to be a witness to—"</P>
<P>Oh! LASCELLES, my perverting fancy caught at the only wrong con∣struction of the sentiment, and I inter∣rupted him by exclaiming,</P>
<P>"Excuse me, my dear Mr. DE GREY—pray excuse me—I would de∣dicate not only my leisure, but my life to the wishes of your family—but to be a <HI>witness</HI>—to be a <HI>witness,</HI> my good Sir, upon so interesting an occasion— is—is—is—indeed, I could not be of any service."</P>
<P>"Service, Mr. CARLISLE," said MEDWAY—"there is no service in the case—the only service you can be of in
<PB N="166" REF="167"/>promoting the design of our visit to this young Lady, is to be a witness that I have had all the reason in the world to suppose I was beloved by her."</P>
<P>"Was it ever questioned, Mr. MED∣WAY," said I?</P>
<P>"Questioned,"—retorted Miss DE GREY—"questioned, Mr. CARLISLE— beloved by me—Mr. MEDWAY beloved by me!"</P>
<P>"<HI>Yes,</HI> Madam, <HI>I,</HI>"—said MEDWAY?</P>
<P>"Now then we come to the point," replied Mr. DE GREY—</P>
<P>"Perhaps these explanations," said I, "may be improper before me—I certainly intrude—Family affairs are
<PB N="167" REF="168"/>sacred—I beg permission to withdraw— Had I known you were upon business of so much delicacy"—</P>
<P>"Stay, Mr. CARLISLE," answered LUCIA, with more firmness than is usual to such extreme delicacy as her's— "it is a justice you <HI>owe me</HI> to stay, Sir—With regard to <HI>you,</HI> Mr. MED∣WAY, I beg to know upon what mis∣construction you found the astonishing fact you charge me with?"</P>
<P>"<HI>Astonishing</HI> fact, Madam," rejoined MEDWAY—"Is it not clear? have I not fed my fond heart with this idea many months?—did you not always meet me with a smile?—have I not a thousand times said, that you was made to be the best wife in the world?—have I not been ready to murder any man that should dare to look stedfastly at
<PB N="168" REF="169"/>you? Has not your father heard me de∣clare, that I would lose my blood in your service?"</P>
<P>Here LUCIA lifted up her hands again.</P>
<P>"I grant all this, my dear MEDWAY," said Mr. DE GREY, "but surely, this is no foundation for a passion. LUCIA smiles whenever she meets any of her friends. It is a complacency that be∣longs to her character—it belongs even to her face: her features are made for giving welcome to her father's friends— <HI>Such</HI> Mr. MEDWAY most certainly <HI>is.</HI>"</P>
<P>"Lookee, Mr. DE GREY," replied MEDWAY—"hush — hush — no noise about this business—I am no talker. I have been intending to make your
<PB N="169" REF="170"/>daughter my wife a long while. I thought both you and she knew plain enough my meaning, especially as I was exceeding cautious least it should be known to any body else—which I despise. I took the affair for granted. It seems I am deceived. Nobody understood my meaning but myself—The business is easily brought to an issue. Here's the upshot. Do you now, Mr. DE GREY, approve of my beginning more explicit overtures?"</P>
<P>"That question," said Mr. DE GREY, "is first to be submitted to my daughter. You are a worthy man, and I here declare I have no objection to <HI>any</HI> gentleman, upon whom I have any solid reasons to believe <HI>she</HI> places her affections."</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="171"/>
"Give me your hand," cried MED∣WAY; "you speak fairly—I love honour better than life—life—it <HI>is</HI> MY heaven— Well, Miss LUCIA, now is the time. Every thing rests with you?"</P>
<P>Guess, if you can, LASCELLES, what I underwent at this moment! My heart was at my lips.</P>
<P>"Since it is incumbent on me to speak," said the beautiful trembler, "I must confess, that, though there is no man I more esteem than Mr. MEDWAY, as a <HI>friend;</HI> yet, yet, in the light of— of—a <HI>lover,</HI> I—I—cannot say that— that—Pray be not displeased with me, if I say that—"</P>
<P>"Enough said, enough said—hush— hush—I'm only angry," said MEDWAY,
<PB N="171" REF="172"/>"that you did not tell me so before; but—no noise—I see it was partly my own fault. Give me a buss—you are a good girl—a bad one at a <HI>hint,</HI> tho'— hush—hush—you are a bad one at a hint. Give me your hand, Mr. DE GREY. I thought I was acting the right part—But I am too old, and too odd a fellow to die of disappointment, so all I have farther to say on the subject is this; don't speak of my affair below— Let us separate—Let us go down a little <HI>after</HI> one another—Who's the wiser? who's the wiser?"</P>
<P>"Another moment, if you please," said Mr. DE GREY, (rising and ad∣vancing to LUCIA, whom in the course of the conversation he had left)—"Since matters have gone thus far, and we are all friends together; tell me, LUCIA,
<PB N="172" REF="173"/>if you think there is any <HI>other</HI> person who may be going on in the same <HI>mistake.</HI> If so, we may rectify it in time. Do you imagine any other, in <HI>this family,</HI> for instance, lays claim to your tenderness, my dear?"</P>
<P>My God, LASCELLES, what a question!</P>
<P>"No, indeed, Sir," answered LUCIA, with a sigh.</P>
<P>"Oh! yes," rejoined MEDWAY, "that bit of a Baronet, Sir ANDREW FLIGHT."</P>
<P>"Sir ANDREW FLIGHT!" cried she hastily—"the matter was not <HI>impro∣bable</HI> with so <HI>worthy</HI> a man as Mr. MEDWAY, but surely Sir ANDREW FLIGHT could never—"</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="174"/>
"Madam," returned MEDWAY, "I was about to have jerked him into a fish pond upon that account. If you have ever any thing to say to such a fellow as that, I'll never forgive you."</P>
<P>"Perhaps it may be in <HI>your</HI> power, Mr. CARLISLE," said Mr. DE GREY, (coming round to me) "to help us to another upon the lover's list."</P>
<P>Think of my confusion, LASCELLES! after great hesitation I spoke as follows, while LUCIA went first to one window then to the other, as if taking different views of the garden.</P>
<P>"I must own, Sir, it does not seem difficult for me to mention another of Miss DE GREY's admirers. The dif∣ficulty would be in finding a person of
<PB N="174" REF="175"/>her acquaintance who did <HI>not</HI> come under that character."</P>
<P>"Come, come, CARLISLE, no noise— no noise," said MEDWAY, "you have <HI>yourself</HI> been her admirer any time these—"</P>
<P>Here LUCIA turned round, with a face blooming with a thousand blushes.</P>
<P>"Mr. CARLISLE <HI>my</HI> admirer, Mr. MEDWAY?—"</P>
<P>"Yes, Miss DE GREY, Mr. CAR∣LISLE has, to my knowledge, been your admirer before he went to Italy. You may thank me—for now I see the whole train of my mistake—that he has pined and grieved, and—"</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="176"/>
"For heaven's sake, Mr. MEDWAY!" said LUCIA.</P>
<P>"CLEMENT," said Mr. DE GREY, "MEDWAY is too hard upon you: he has had a slight scratch of the passion himself, and he wants to make us be∣lieve you have had a wound too. But come, Mr. MEDWAY, I have something to shew you in the library—such a fishing-pole as, perhaps, you never saw."</P>
<P>They both went out of the room hand-in-hand — LUCIA attempted to follow.</P>
<P>"And <HI>must</HI> you go then, Miss DE GREY?" said I.</P>
<P><HI>"Go,"</HI> replied she, turning—"lord, why not, Mr. CARLISLE?—I am going to see the fishing-pole."</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="177"/>
"What a blessing I should have deemed it, Miss DE GREY, if this dis∣covery had been made before I went to Italy!"</P>
<P>"What did you say, Mr. CAR∣LISLE?—Italy—Good God!—Has your Italian attractions then—"</P>
<P>"O LUCIA!—LUCIA! I can hold no longer—Too long—too long already hath a sense of honour, and a religious regard to what I, all the time, thought <HI>your happiness,</HI> kept me silent—for this I bleed—for this I was in despair— for this too it was that I was again pre∣paring to depart—But—truth requires no longer sacrifice. My feelings may now again shew themselves—Again may I adore those charming eyes—again— You are not angry with me, LUCIA?"</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="178"/>
"Angry with you—CLEMENT?"</P>
<P>"Dear, generous LUCIA DE GREY— This hand must bear the impression of my gratitude."</P>
<P>"Pshaw—nonsense—how <HI>can</HI> you, CARLISLE? but you were departing— whither would you go, CARLISLE?"</P>
<P>"I had forgot that my chaise is at the door, LUCIA?"</P>
<P>"And must you go then, CLEMENT?"</P>
<P>"<HI>Go,</HI> my adorable LUCIA! yes I must go this moment—I must go as fast as my feet can carry me, to—order my horses to be put into Mr. DE GREY's stable."</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="179"/>
"How soon you men alter your minds, <HI>Clement.</HI>"</P>
<P>"Ah, LUCIA! LUCIA! I am now possessing one of the happiest moments of my life."</P>
<P>"I am myself not <HI>miserable,</HI> CAR∣LISLE—and — and — and so take my hand, and—"</P>
<P>"Do with it what I please!—"</P>
<P>For the first time since my return, I not only kissed <HI>that,</HI> LASCELLES, but ravished a rapture upon her rosy lip. Here is an end of my conversation-letter.</P>
<P>I shall <HI>not</HI> come to town—my horses are turned to grass—Love is likely to allow them a long feast of pasturage— I cannot tell you how light I feel at the

<HEAD>LETTER C. Mr. LASCELLES to Mr. HEATHCOATE.</HEAD>
<P>A MISERY, and a misfor∣tune more extreme than before, hath fallen upon me—The Marquis is come— The Marchioness is every thing but ab∣solutely distracted—My sister is over∣whelmed in tears! I am plunging in the abyss of despair. My whole family is in ruins.</P>
<P>A violent thundering at my door last night, and almost towards the zenith of it, announced the impatience of some∣body who had authority to disturb us.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="182"/>
Ah! HEATHCOATE, conscious guilt at that moment emasculated my usual hardihood; I felt my heart convuls∣ing in my bosom, and the shameful drops of <HI>fear</HI> were upon my brow. Flying then from my bed, wrapt up only in a <HI>robe de chambre,</HI> I charged my servants to deny me—gave my sister the like injunction, and then stole, with in∣glorious terror, into a kind of lumber∣room at the top of the house, that I might escape even the <HI>voice</HI> of my ac∣cuser. To this precaution, probably, am I indebted for my life—Who, HEATHCOATE, can <HI>expect</HI> to conquer the man whom he has <HI>wronged?</HI> For money, I am mercenary enough to fight, but with the weight of <HI>crimes</HI> upon the heart, one's intrepidity hath no room to play.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="183"/>
The knocking being for some time repeated, and every repetition with more vehemence, admittance was at length given.</P>
<P>Oh these high-spirited foreigners! No sooner was he entered, than he de∣manded, in a tone of implicit com∣mand, his violated wife. He did not, it seems, wait any reply. He did not wait even long enough for obedience. In disregard of every thing that looked like ceremony, he flew up stairs—rushed from one room to another; and found at last the object of his search. I heard the shriek of the Marchioness's amaze∣ment, even to the remotest corner of my hiding hole. Barbarous man! aban∣doned woman! re-echoed thro' the cave. I was witness to the clamourous denun∣ciation
<PB N="183" REF="184"/>of death upon CARLISLE and myself. I was witness that the Marquis was in possession of CARLISLE's address— the name of DE GREY, and even of LUCIA, were articulated with curses of vengeance—With execrations, still stronger, was all future connexion with the Marchioness renounced; and he rushed down the stair-case at last, swear∣ing never more to close his eyes till his revenge, as far as it could be had in <HI>this</HI> world (that was his expression) was compleat.</P>
<P>Since his departure, I have crept from my sanctuary, and tried, but not with∣out tremor, to gain admittance to the apartment of AUGUSTA. She has drawn a triple bolt across the door— She will not speak—My sister is on the
<PB N="184" REF="185"/>bed of sickness. O TRUTH! what a DEITY art THOU?—thy smile might chace away despair. But what are these reflections to the pusillanimous and false</P>

<P>AT length, my dear Miss LASCELLES, the long line of mysteries is unravelled. Yes, my friend, the cause of your poor LUCIA's anxiety is now no longer problematical. Alas! it is made but too manifest! So there IS an Italian attachment I find after all! the warm heart of Captain CARLISLE could not, it seems, remain insensible of beauty, blooming under so bright a sun. Nay, his passion, to do him justice, is of the most fashionable kind. A <HI>wife</HI> has been his object: to give him greater eclat—the wife of his <HI>friend</HI>—</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="190"/>
Oh, Miss LASCELLES, I have not patience to go on—Oh that I could find—that I could but have a single glance of this all-accomplished Marchio∣ness of N—! <HI>That</HI> is his dulcinea— She must be <HI>very</HI> handsome—she must, certainly, surpass all the ladies on this side the line—Heavens, Miss LAS∣CELLES, what an angel she must be!— <HI>I</HI> must be a—but why do I talk of such a deformity as myself! The superior charms of the Marchioness—Oh, Miss LASCELLES, that I could see her!</P>
<P>But from whom do you suppose I received this illustrious intelligence?— even from the injured husband himself. The letter of the Marquis is at this minute before me. My eye, even now, fixes upon that part of the epistle where—</P>

Oh, Miss LASCELLES, however me∣rited the vengeance which I now per∣ceive hanging over the head of CAR∣LISLE, his life is still precious to me, and I must make an effort at least to prevent the mischief—I thought him, my friend, the very <HI>Tutor of Truth,</HI> instead of which, I behold him the Preceptor of Infamy—yet—for his <HI>life</HI>—let it be preserved, that he may <HI>mend</HI> it.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CIV. Miss LUCIA DE GREY to Miss LAS∣CELLES.</HEAD>
<P>WHO, CAROLINE, can say unto misery, thus far shalt thou go and no farther? I am more compleatly a wretch than ever.</P>
<P>Soon after I had sent away my last, CARLISLE came to pay me the compli∣ments of the day. He paid them with the best dissembled tenderness you ever saw. He congratulated his heart upon the return of its tranquillity—He took my hand, and carried it with a zeal
<PB N="194" REF="195"/>which any woman might have taken for real, to his lips. He even talked, with blooming cheeks, upon the day of marriage: he pretended that he suffered unutterable things by delay. He said, he should never be happy till I was his. He absolutely carried the cruel joke so far as to assert, he had commissioned your brother to purchase decorations for the joyful day!</P>
<P>This seemed a proper opportunity to draw up the curtain, and discover the first scene of his farce. Oh what a dialogue!</P>
<P>"I think, Mr. CARLISLE, you wrote some letters to my father from the house of a Marquis of N. during your residence at Rome?"</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="196"/>
"I did, Madam—I did, my dear LUCIA."</P>
<P>"You spoke, I think, occasionally, of the Marchioness his Lady?"</P>
<P>"I did. She is a charming woman. Except LUCIA DE GREY, I never saw a lovelier."</P>
<P>"'Pshaw, your exception is a flat∣tery. Is she sensible?"</P>
<P>"She is, beyond imagination."</P>
<P>"You were upon very good terms, no doubt?"</P>
<P>"The best in the world. I have sat the whole evening conversing with her upon subjects even of science."</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="197"/>
"A <HI>learned</HI> Lady then!"</P>
<P>"Rather <HI>accomplished</HI> than learned: she wants, however, that gentleness which distinguishes the lovely LUCIA DE GREY."</P>
<P>"You left her, certainly, with regret?"</P>
<P>"Had it not been for LUCIA DE GREY, whom I fondly expected to see, it might have been so."</P>
<P>"Is she still at Rome, Captain CAR∣LISLE?"</P>
<P>"I fancy not, LUCIA. The Mar∣quis visits in Rome, but his home is Paris. Though the Marchioness her∣self is a native of England, and I had the pleasure to revive her acquaintance
<PB N="197" REF="198"/>with her own language so much, that she now speaks it as fluently as the French and Italian."</P>
<P>"Those were agreeable <HI>tete-a-tetes.</HI> Pray did she never express any desire to see her native country?"</P>
<P>"Oh often—almost every hour."</P>
<P>"Was it not incumbent on your politeness, CLEMENT, to offer them a—"</P>
<P>"I did; but the Marquis was obliged to take a journey to the interior part of Italy."</P>
<P>"The Marchioness accompanied him him, no doubt?"</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="199"/>
"No, she was ill at that time with a cold, and did not go with the Marquis."</P>
<P>"I protest I should not have been surprized if she had, in such an ab∣sence, played truant, and come over to her native country with you, CLE∣MENT?"</P>
<P>"With me—LUCIA—come over with me—Why that, you know, would have been—a—a—"</P>
<P>"Like a woman of spirit, that is all. I dare say now, CLEMENT, if you would but confess, this <HI>has</HI> been the case."</P>
<P>"How can you think so?—what reason in nature have you—to—to—?</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="200"/>
"Why, not much reason, indeed; but a billet, which I received this morn∣ing, mentions a Lady that, in some degree, allowing for the alteration, as Mr. HENRY HEWSON says, answers the description of the Marchioness."</P>
<P>"May I—may I beg permission to peruse your billet, LUCIA?—Is it from—"</P>
<P>"'Tis from a quite new correspon∣dent; and, by-the-by, there is a small inclosure for you. Here are both."</P>
<P>I gave him, Miss LASCELLES, the Marquis's letter.</P>
<P>"It is very true, Miss DE GREY," said he, without any emotion, after reading them, "that the Marchioness is at present under my protection; and
<PB N="200" REF="201"/>it is true also that she came to England, though not with me, very soon after me."</P>
<P>"Is it? then the Marquis is not angry without cause?"</P>
<P>"It is a painful circumstance to re∣late, my dear LUCIA, though there is no guilt on either side. You will ex∣cuse me on the subject. I beg you will, for a few hours, keep the matter from Mr. DE GREY, and all the rest of the family. I shall certainly wait upon the Marquis, and accommodate every thing. She is still worthy of his affection."</P>
<P>Did you ever, CAROLINE, see <HI>guilt confessed,</HI> carried with so high a hand? He is so habituated, I suppose, to crimes of this nature, in his Italian connexions, that he thinks nothing of it. 'Tis, in
<PB N="201" REF="202"/>his notion, I dare say, an innocent free∣dom, and not seduction. Was there ever so composed a libertine? He has just made his bow, without any other sort of disorder, and walked off.—Let him fight, CAROLINE! let him fall—I hate the sight of him—I—I—I— oh, my God, my God, what a wretch I am!</P>

<P>THE obstinate Marchioness hath rejected all nourishment till this day, with a pertinacious violence and resolution peculiarly her own.

This apprehension is removed by the receipt of the inclosed billet—You will <HI>there</HI> see the terms upon which she requested CARLISLE's direction. You will see too that it
<PB N="210" REF="211"/>would have been impolitic in me, under such circumstances (and especially as she must be too feeble to stir abroad), to stand out with her. Besides this, I have her <HI>under guard;</HI> the trusty MA∣RYANNE will not suffer a second escape. The Marchioness seems much more composed. She does not beat her beautiful bosom; she does not loudly lament her fate as before: the maid is this moment passing my room, in her way to the apartment of my poor sick CAROLINE, with assurances of AU∣GUSTA's tranquillity—Thus far, there∣fore, there is a treaty betwixt me and agony. But this is only guarding against the enemy in one quarter, while one is more open to his attack in another. The Marquis is certainly hovering about—Perhaps he is gone down with the sword of Italiant-taught revenge

<HEAD>LETTER CX. The Marchioness of N*** to Signora — at Rome.</HEAD>
<P>BE it sufficient apology to you for my late silence, that I tell you I have been a prisoner till within this hour, without the privilege of getting a letter to the post. Such is the con∣sequence of following the fortunes of the man you love. But on this subject I can speak no more. My strength is almost gone, and yet I am setting out for a journey—The horses are putting to the carriage. It is not to <HI>Rome.</HI> It is not to Paris—No, Signora, it is to the retreat of Captain CARLISLE. Yes, my VIOLA, I have at length obtained
<PB N="220" REF="221"/>his address, his <HI>real</HI> address, and I am going at full speed to make use of it—Be not startled, my friend—I set out with no hostile design.—My violent wishes for revenge are all composed now their object is in my power—In <HI>my</HI> power, VIOLA? oh, Heavens, CAR∣LISLE is in the Marquis's power—Even now <HI>perhaps</HI> there may be an horrid in∣terview—My blood runs cold at the thought — Oh that the horses were ready!—They <HI>are</HI>—they <HI>are!</HI> — The postilion opens to me the door—I will take the unfinished letter in my pocket— I will pay double—<HI>double,</HI> VIOLA; I will pay an <HI>hundred fold</HI> for my speed— the life—the precious life of <HI>Carlisle</HI> is in danger—I am gone—</P>
<P>In Continuation.</P>
<P>There is five minutes stop to change horses—the other poor faithful crea∣tures
<PB N="221" REF="222"/>are panting before me—I take up a very bad pen to tell you, that, though I am now travelling in the night, and that a dark one, I travel as a man, and am not without arms. Join with me, VIOLA, to bless the name of MARYANNE—To a poor creature so called am I indebted for at least the chance of saving the loveliest of men— the <HI>chance!</HI> oh, my God, is it then reduced to a chance?—to a bare pro∣bability? I would sooner have every other work of nature annihilated, than that the least misery should happen to CLEMENT CARLISLE—Ah!

<P><PB N="222" REF="223"/>
In Continution.</P>
<P>We are changing again—but I am always somewhat the later, as there is, it seems, a gentleman travelling with equal speed, the same road, and he forestalls the swiftest horses. Perhaps, Signora, it is the <HI>Marquis</HI>—Perhaps every turn of his carriage-wheels pre∣cipitates the fate of my CARLISLE— oh horror—horror!—oh that the horses had wings instead of feet! — Thank heaven they look fleeter than my last— They are pawing, and champing the bit proudly before me—I shed tears of joy at the symptom—I move onwards—</P>
<P>In Continution.</P>
<P>Ah! Signora—Signora, I am agi∣tated by ten thousand fears—The per∣son,
<PB N="223" REF="224"/>who is going so furiously before me, proves to be LASCELLES—The maid who released me from my prison∣chamber told me he was gone a different road—What can be the meaning of this?—I have all along described the per∣son of the Marquis, but have received no account that answers—Perhaps he may be yet tracing his enemy, as he calls him, through the streets of Lon∣don, and I may still be so happy as to preserve him—Oh, VIOLA! what a charming thought!</P>
<P>The pen and ink is with me in the chaise—You must dispense with a hand∣writing scarcely legible—</P>
<P>I keep at proper distance from the carriage of LASCELLES—I have bribed
<PB N="224" REF="225"/>my postilion into implicit obedience— Money seems to do every thing in this country—</P>
<P>Oh Heavens, VIOLA! we are in the middle of the last stage—LASCELLES increases his pace—How shall I obtain an interview with CARLISLE? Shall I drive directly to the house and require an audience? Shall I carry to him ter∣ror in my look, and insist upon being heard?</P>
<P>Ah, no, Signora—Let me not, now that all my unhappy enthusiasm for re∣venge is over—let me not interrupt the scheme of joy that is carrying on be∣twixt him and a worthy woman—Why, poor innocent! should her passion be destroyed by mine?—<HI>Her's</HI> is regular—
<PB N="225" REF="226"/>chaste, correct, consistent—<HI>She</HI> never <HI>intentionally</HI> clashed with the unfortunate Marchioness of N * * *</P>
<P>No, VIOLA, I will never disturb the gentle bosom of another woman, whom I know to be guiltless—Let them be happy, Signora—Let them be happy— I shall be in my grave.</P>
<P>I have come to a resolution, VIOLA! I will discharge my carriage before I enter the town, and then wrapping myself up in my coat, walk on, till I enquire out some inn or open house— There will I <HI>write</HI> my fears, and send them to Mr. CARLISLE. If his answer mentions his safety, and his intention to remain so, I will then return to—ah, whither, Signora—I have no house— no fortune—no husband—no friend—</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="227"/>
And shall I depart without even seeing him?—Hard—a very hard trial for me, VIOLA! oh, what feelings oppress me!— No matter—no matter—My fatal love has already endangered his precious life, and if I can now save him, I will be content to suffer.</P>
<P>LASCELLES paid off his chaise before me—We stopt within a quarter of a mile of the village—I saw him descend— he walk'd briskly on—I hastened to discharge my account—saw both the carriages return homeward, and pre∣pared to follow Mr. LASCELLES—I will follow <HI>his</HI> steps precisely, unless they lead directly to Mr. CARLISLE, and delicacy shall prevail, though the sacri∣fice were to kill me.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="228"/>
Ha! the postman blows his horn— he passes me—he takes my packet, tho' his bags are sealed—I pay for his civi∣lity—Upon the chance of my letters getting to Rome, I make use of the wafer I have in my pocket, and send it away.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CXII. From the Same to the Same.</HEAD>
<P>NEVER surely, Miss LAS∣CELLES, was any scene so complicated with horrors and surprises, as that to which I have just been a witness. I write now in the deepest distress, and write now in the deepest distress, and in a house of general mourning. In the first place, Miss LASCELLES, your brother is no more—the fair but un∣happy occasion of his death is also near her end, and the husband is almost distracted. Ah, my CAROLINE, how I tremble!</P>
<P>But it is necessary for me, however painful, to proceed to the minutest of this horrid business.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="231"/>
I traced Mr. CARLISLE, unobserved, till he came within view of the spot. I heard somebody advance from behind a tree. It was the Marquis of N ***. It was too late to discover myself, or to hope any thing from entreaties. They joined, and walked together. I went tremblingly behind. CARLISLE told the whole history of the unfortu∣nate AUGUSTA. He attributed the whole to frolic: he protested that she was still under the most sacred pro∣tection at the house of Mr. LASCELLES in London. He pleaded a thousand apologies — Pledged himself for her fidelity. The Marquis would scarce suffer him to finish a single sentence without interruption: he is the most headstrong man in the world; he exe∣crated CARLISLE as a <HI>seducer;</HI> he even reprobated him as a <HI>coward.</HI> He in∣fisted upon taking his life, if it was not
<PB N="231" REF="232"/>immediately defended. He strode on∣ward to measure the ground.</P>
<P>"A little farther <HI>on</HI> then, Sir," said he to the Marquis, "this is not a pro∣per place for our, in my opinion, very unnecessary business. — Behind yonder house is a heath, the clash of our weapons will not there be heard."</P>
<P>I was ready to expire, my dearest Miss LASCELLES, at every step, and with very great difficulty escaped ob∣servation.</P>
<P>"If it <HI>must</HI> be so, Sir," continued CARLISLE, "this is the spot."</P>
<P>At this moment, Miss LASCELLES, we heard a confused murmur of voices. The sounds came from the other side of a small plantation of firs.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="233"/>
"Stop, Sir," cried the Marquis— "no witnesses—all fair play, if you please; I do not mean to assassinate <HI>you, Carlisle;</HI> nor shall you assassinate me."</P>
<P>They both went on the other side of the plantation—The moon shot forth her ray at the very instant of entering; and as if Providence designed it so, her beams were beyond comparison bright— Oh earth and heaven, what a scene was opened upon us from removing this curtain of darkness!</P>
<P>In one part we beheld the persons of Mr. MEDWAY and Mr. LASCELLES, as it proved to be, standing upon the de∣fensive. In another stood the figure of a <HI>stripling</HI> leaning pensively against a fir, as if he were unengaged in the combat, yet chose to be a spectator. At a small
<PB N="233" REF="234"/>distance (yet not sufficiently near to be distinguished for the persons they <HI>really</HI> were) clustered another groupe, as if they wished rather to see, than to be seen.</P>
<P>"Confusion," said MEDWAY, "we are discovered. If I knew by <HI>whom,</HI> I would annihilate him—Ha!" continued he, looking in the face of his antago∣nist, "by Heaven, this is not Sir ANDREW FLIGHT."</P>
<P>"I am his <HI>friend,</HI> Sir," said the other, "and I choose to fight for him— Curse on the moon-beams!"—</P>
<P>"Good God," cried CARLISLE, by this time come near enough to recog∣nize him: "Is it my friend LASCELLES, whom I behold?"</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="235"/>
"<HI>Carlisle!</HI>" exclaimed Mr. LAS∣CELLES—"Is it you?"</P>
<P>"Come, Sir," said the Marquis eagerly, "no trifling — my time is precious."</P>
<P>CARLISLE drew his sword.</P>
<P>"Oh, oh; hush — hush" — said MEDWAY, "softly—if that's the case— no noise: we are all come upon the same errand, I find. Advance then, every man his bird, and there's an end of it. As to Sir ANDREW, I will chastise him for <HI>himself,</HI> and in the mean time, as you think fit to represent him, I will chastise you for meddling in the quarrels of a fool—Come on, Sir."</P>
<P>He fired his pistol in a moment: Mr. LASCELLES exchanged the salu∣tation—They
<PB N="235" REF="236"/>were preparing again— The Marquis and CARLISLE began to parry.</P>
<P>Mr. LASCELLES seeing this, eagerly threw down his pistol:</P>
<P>"Stop, stop, for Heaven's sake stop," said he to the Marquis—"touch not—lift not your arm against CAR∣LISLE, I charge you—Here, Sir—here into this bosom direct your vengeance— 'Tis I, Marquis, I have been the cause of all your misfortune."</P>
<P>There was no time for expostulation: Mr. LASCELLES caught the sword from the hand of CARLISLE, and insisted upon <HI>first</HI> engaging with the Marquis.</P>
<P>CARLISLE was without arms. MED∣WAY hastened to arm him. The Mar∣quis
<PB N="236" REF="237"/>rushed upon him, without regard∣ing LASCELLES.</P>
<P>LASCELLES again threw himself be∣fore CARLISLE, and even pushed vi∣gorously at the Marquis. He was at length provoked to begin with your brother, my dear Miss LASCELLES The very first thrust of the Marquis was fatal, for the weapon passed thro' the side of Mr. LASCELLES into his heart. The Marquis received a wound also in exchange—</P>
<P>Your brother had scarce fallen, be∣fore the stripling, whom the other ob∣jects had prevented from more notice (and who had, indeed, retired farther off upon seeing us) now came forward in a feeble manner, and fell upon the ground almost at the feet of the Mar∣quis.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="238"/>
"Desist, desist," said the poor thing, in the most piercing tone in the world— "desist from farther altercation—Here lies, at the point of all her wishes, the unhappy cause of—"</P>
<P>The sentence was left unfinished, for the speaker of it fainted away.</P>
<P>Oh, Miss LASCELLES, it was the Marchioness of N *** in disguise— She had raised her own beautiful arm against her own charming bosom. The point of a small sword was still sticking there.</P>
<P>I ran to her relief.</P>
<P>The Marquis stood fixed in horror, but still looked sullen.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="239"/>
MEDWAY was gone.</P>
<P>CARLISLE was agonized by the most divided attention.</P>
<P>The Marchioness appeared to be ex∣piring—She requested to be carried to LASCELLES, who was in the same situation—</P>
<P>It is too hard a task for me, Miss LASCELLES, to recount to you the dreadful particulars of this pathetic scene. It is incumbent upon me, how∣ever, to observe, that such circum∣stances appeared on the part of your brother by his own dying confession, that, as it is impossible for his life to have been happy, you will the less la∣ment him. <HI>You,</HI> however, my dear Miss LASCELLES, he cleared from every im∣putation that might, in consequence of
<PB N="239" REF="240"/>these discoveries, have been thrown upon you—He confessed his error—he bathed the lovely hand of poor AUGUSTA with his last tears. He received her forgiveness—As for the Marchioness herself—Oh, Miss LASCELLES—words can give you no idea of her situation.</P>
<P>She was tremblingly sensible to every thing—She looked tenderly at me, and gave my hand to CARLISLE.</P>
<P>She gave it as she lay bleeding be∣fore us—We conveyed her to Prudence Place. Her husband is not even yet convinced of his cruelties, yet she kissed his hand—She wondered not, she said, at CARLISLE's preference.</P>
<P>"Superior beauty added to superior virtue," said she, taking my hand, "might well conquer."</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="241"/>
Ah, CAROLINE! how I felt this flat∣tery—It went through my very heart— My father wept over her—I never saw a house of so much misery—Poor CAR∣LISLE'S condition was more touching than the rest—He execrates himself as the innocent cause of all—The Mar∣quis and he are now together—The Marquis seems not to regard his wound, which is deeper than we imagined— yet he is not so tender as he should be to AUGUSTA. Your brother is laid on CARLISLE'S bed—I saw him, a little while since, take his lifeless hand gently, and turn away weeping.</P>
<P>"Poor fellow," said he, afterwards, to me, "the beauty of the temptation was great—his love of the dice may well account for <HI>all</HI> the rest. I loved him much—Let his failings excite no
<PB N="241" REF="242"/>other terror than that of making us the wiser for his example.</P>
<P>Here, my CAROLINE, is a prospect darkened—Do not believe I can rejoice under such circumstances—Your bro∣ther's corpse will be—Oh, CAROLINE, these are hard subjects—I must resign them to a firmer hand than that of the trembling</P>

<P>THE tears that flowed from the eyes of LUCIA, as she bade the ser∣vant carry a letter with your address to the post, convince me, how sincerely she joins me in deploring the unhappy circumstances of Mr. LASCELLES'S death. Yet, what consolation can, in these cases, be offered to you? Notwithstand∣ing your brother's mistakes in other re∣spects, his <HI>fraternal</HI> affection might be very unblemished: if so, you will na∣turally
<PB N="245" REF="246"/>cast a veil of oblivion over such parts of his character as were concealed from you and his other friends, and you must lament that part of the misfortune which deprives you of a tender relation. LUCIA'S society, however, may assist your sense, and smooth your path to that acquiescence which must be ob∣tained. Come therefore, dear Madam, amongst us: or rather, prepare your∣self for such a journey. It is not, me∣thinks, adviseable to be here till after the present week. Mr. LASCELLES, with his dying breath, bequeathed his remains to CLEMENT CARLISLE. He requested that the legacy might be ac∣cepted as a testimony of Mr. CARLISLE'S forgiveness. He will perform his duty to your satisfaction.</P>
<P>Our situation is too painful at this crisis for me to proceed. But let it

<HEAD>LETTER CXV. From Miss DE GREY to Miss LAS∣CELLES.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT a peculiarity of dis∣position marks the Marquis of N***! Though his wound, which he received from your brother, is become more alarming, he insisted upon being per∣mitted to go into the apartment of the poor languishing AUGUSTA at a very unseasonable hour of the last night. CARLISLE dissuaded him from this; but soon after he again renewed the subject, and was admitted.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="249"/>
He shut to the door, and spoke to his Lady in a very ungentle manner. We were going to expostulate with him upon the impropriety of this conduct, when he came out of the room, and told us, the Marchioness would be well enough to depart soon—He did not stay for any reply to this strange intelli∣gence, but ran down stairs into the saloon, and from thence into the stable. He insisted upon his horse, on which, under pretence of taking the air, tho' he was scarce able to sit, he rode away at full speed. He disturbed us, to enjoy this frolic, in the middle of the night; and he has not been heard of since. Surely there never lived so singular a character.</P>
<P>Alas! the Marchioness is by no means in the recovering way the Marquis re∣presented her. Though her wound was
<PB N="249" REF="250"/>more promising at the last dressing, her fever is rather increased than abated. Yet she has never spoken disrespectfully of this strange husband since her illness. She seemed much relieved, however, at the news of his being gone. "Then," says she, "I shall die in peace: he will not come again to abuse me."</P>
<P>How pathetically, my dear Miss LAS∣CELLES, am I concerned for the life of this lovely woman!—Do not believe I counterfeit: I speak sincerely. Her conduct has a larger apology in the treatment of so barbarous a husband. —Pray Heaven! she may recover.</P>
<P>Since I wrote this sentence, I have been at her bed-side, and she cried out—"Oh, Miss DE GREY, how good you are?—Violent as <HI>I</HI> have been—for which I know you will forgive me—
<PB N="250" REF="251"/>had I <HI>known</HI> Mr. CARLISLE'S LUCIA before, I am convinced my veneration for her would have cured me! If I wish to recover, Madam, it is only to shew you my gratitude: indeed it is!"</P>

<P>HERE'S pretty news for you! A rascally Lord refuses to give me sa∣tisfaction, and a villainous Baronet has writ me a challenge, and run away with∣out keeping his appointment. He wanted, moreover, to have bilk'd me by a representative, one LASCELLES, who is killed by another hand, just as he was going to attack me for a sum of money, with a design to send me to the shades, and make off with the price of killing me. There have, also, several other strange things happened in this family of late. There is a wounded Marquis gone just now bleed∣ing
<PB N="252" REF="253"/>away: and his wife is upon her, as I think, death-bed. For this last mat∣ter I am much concerned, as she is, even now, a most lovely young creature, and I hate, of all things, that young handsome women should die; though the Marquis, her husband, has no worthy quality belonging to him but his courage. I choose to give up my pretensions to LUCIA. I choose to give her to CAR∣LISLE, because she loves him, I find, better than me. I choose to alter my will in her favour. All these points are so many touches of my humour. But as to this Baronet, I must hunt him every where on this side Heaven, till I have him upon his knees. He made his escape ingloriously this morning, and indeed lurked about the house like a scout with a pale face, ever since the death of LASCELLES, his bravado.

<P>THE most superlative degree of astonishment seized me at the receipt of your letter. As to Sir A.

Besides this, Sir, my authors tell me, such battles are criminal, and that he who kills a man by the way of a duel sports with that eternity which he enters upon, without his commission. But you are a very fierce gentleman, and if the sage Socrates himself was to tell you, you were in the wrong, I do not doubt but you would stigmatize the venerable seer as a coward.</P>
<P>To avoid all these concussions of the soul and body, and to fly from a scene which is no longer fit for a scholar's re∣sidence, I have betaken myself away, and send this immediately on my arrival at Sombre-Hedges.</P>
<P>If I have unwittingly offended, Sir, be assured that I implore a thousand pardons; and that I may never offend again, be satisfied also, that I will no
<PB N="258" REF="259"/>more put my head into high places, where the superior powers of the food∣ful earth are quarrelling in the face of day for want of other avocation.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CXIX. Mr. MEDWAY to the Duke of DOWN∣DERDALE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR nephew has run away. When I thought of giving him the meeting, I imagined him my equal— that is to say, I imagined him an honest man, who is a prince's equal. But, within these few minutes, I have found him very much <HI>my</HI> inferior, and below my sword, by being—a <HI>villain;</HI> who not only hired a tool to fight for him, but had condescended to lay plots for the <HI>destruction</HI> of the <HI>sex</HI> which he
<PB N="260" REF="261"/>ought to <HI>protect.</HI> This, therefore, is written to acquaint him, that I have, for the future, nothing to do with any part of him but his <HI>nose,</HI> which I shall twist as nearly round as possible, when I see him. No noise. Let him keep his secret, and no greater harm will happen to him, from the <HI>supreme indig∣nation</HI> of</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CXX. Mr. MEDWAY to Mr. GABRIEL HEW∣SON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>COLONEL CARLISLE and Mr. DE GREY have interceded with me to accept your apology; you may therefore go safely to bed in Sombre∣Hedges, with Pliny Junior, although I have just heard you were bold enough to write a letter to <HI>Lucia</HI> upon a certain subject at a certain time—Hush—you comprehend me. However, let that pass. Read in a corner and keep at home for the future.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="263"/>
You did me justice in supposing I would not take an affront from Socrates. By Heaven, I would not brook a wrong <HI>look</HI> from that Caesar who penned his own commentaries—no, not from Mars himself. Never make a noise, but let <HI>Hush</HI> be your motto.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CXXI. Miss DE GREY to Miss LASCELLES.</HEAD>
<P>NOT a word yet from the unaccountable Marquis, although we wish very much to send him news of his wife's surprising change for the better. By the care of our excellent physician, and by her own previous happy state of health, her wound is healed within a few days to every body's astonishment. Her candid behaviour to me has engaged not only my at∣tention, but my tenderness. She says, she loves Mr. CARLISLE now, just as much as she ought to love an amiable
<PB N="264" REF="265"/>man who is to be the husband of her protectress.</P>
<P>She never enquires after the Marquis.</P>
<P>I am summoned. Make yourself easy for Heaven's sake, my CAROLINE— This request is not more at the heart of your LUCIA, than at that of the beau∣tiful Marchioness, who speaks of you with a warmth of gratitude peculiar to her. Poor thing, I hope we shall nurse her up yet.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CXXII. From the Same to the Same.</HEAD>
<P>THE occasion of my being so soon called away from my writing∣desk, while I was last addressing my very dear CAROLINE, was to be present at an interview betwixt my father and Mr. and Mrs. HEWSON.</P>
<P>They desired a few minutes conversa∣tion with me and Mr. DE GREY, in the library. They came hand-in-hand. They opened the design of their visit immediately.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="267"/>
"Master DE GREY," said the hus∣band, "I am obliged to you for all favours, but I have had enough of your high life: so has HETT: we have seen men killed, women wounded, friends fighting, honest men's wives attempted to be '<HI>bauched,</HI> and Lords taking pet without '<HI>casion.</HI> So in a few words, HETT and I have '<HI>solved</HI> to go back, and live again at Skelter. As to fine breedin, we'l make that out as well as we can. Better be <HI>unp'lite,</HI> Master DE GREY, than '<HI>plite</HI> enough to cut friend's throat, and '<HI>bauch</HI> friend's wife: so ser∣vant, Master DE GREY, and God be with you."</P>
<P>My father applauded this resolution, and without any more ceremony they parted.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="268"/>
They are this minute actually on their way to Helter-Skelter-Hall.</P>
<P>The Marchioness continues to im∣prove. But—soft—There is a servant just dismounting from his horse, whose sides give smoaking testimony of the rider's expedition.</P>
<P>He is coming into the house—his look and speed alarm me.</P>
<P>In Continuation.</P>
<P>Oh, Heaven, my CAROLINE, the Marquis of N * * * is no more. The messenger delivered a letter to the Marchioness which mentions his <HI>death.</HI> The letter is from a relation of his in
<PB N="268" REF="269"/>London, where he died—The wound being neglected, turned to a mortifi∣cation, and dispatched him in a few hours—This obstinate man, it seems, shewed his resentment even upon his death-bed, and bequeathed all his for∣tune to a distant branch of his family— Not a single guinea to his Lady—She read the letter with very little emotion, considering what is said to be his na∣tural violence. But she resolves to go directly to London, feeble as she is, and pay him the last duties. She ha∣zards the air too soon, but she persists. CARLISLE says, she is deprived of every thing by this stroke, but a scanty jointure. I ventured to touch upon this. She frankly said, in answer, that she had sufficient fortune in the loss of a cruel, tyrannical husband!</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="270"/>
In Continuation.</P>
<P>No intreaties can prevail upon the Marchioness to stay. She declares she is well. Her fever is indeed gone, but the Doctor says, she risques a relapse. She has paid to my father and me her parting civilities. They were terribly touching, CAROLINE. She suppressed a sigh as she gave her hand to CAR∣LISLE; but she recovered herself, and with incredible resolution got into her chaise, accompanied by Mr. MEDWAY.</P>
<P>Pray come down to us immediately. With the different transitions from one affecting object to another, I am quite fatigued. I tremble for the Marchio∣ness—I feel for you—I am unhappy to think it should be my fate to interfere
<PB N="270" REF="271"/>with the happiness of another woman. Yet CLEMENT is too dear to be re∣signed, and poor, frail human nature will prevail.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. HENRY HEWSON to Mr. GABRIEL.</HEAD>
<P>WE have gotten again to the Hall, brother GAB—sick to the souls of us to the <HI>p'lite</HI> thing. HETT, and I, never saw old Skelter look so well in our lives—What's better, the old moss and stones have not been yet meddled with. Every thing was glad to see us come <HI>whame</HI> again—Dog Dashgrove got grin into's feace, just as thof he was <HI>p'lite,</HI> and I <HI>thouft</HI> spaniel bitch would have lost tail with wagging it at me. I took pointer out, and ha'
<PB N="274" REF="275"/>shotten 2 brace o'birds, half which I send you by carrier. HETT last night made sillabub, and milk'd crumple-horn herself—What do you think of that? She may bless herself she was not <HI>'bauched,</HI> and you, that that son of a gun MED∣WAY did not <HI>pounce</HI> you—There's doings indeed! A curse on't, a man can neither <HI>keep</HI>'s life nor wife 'mong your <HI>p'lite genii.</HI> So much for <HI>bettermost specie.</HI> Afore I come away, I told Master DE GREY a bit of my mind. And atween ourselves, GAB, why should you and I go out of our way, to make fools of ourselves? CARLISLE is, to be sure, a good lad, but as for the rest o' the pack, 'cept Master DE GREY—hush— hush, as MEDWAY says—Never stir, if HETT and I did not lie in clover last night. We snuggled together in old yellow bed upon farmer's sheet of her
<PB N="275" REF="276"/>own working, and we got up better than if we had been ducked in dainty down of <HI>p'liter genii.</HI> l'th' morning, in came neighbour Carter, Tim Trad∣dleditch, Gef. Geehup, and Walter Wake, and ga' the bells a bit of a gangle on the 'cassion. Upon this, I tapt harvest-beer, No. 11. left side of little cellar, where cyder us'd to stand, you know—Upon this, we '<HI>vited</HI> neighbours wifes, and Abraham Amen, the clerk, and Davy Dipstick, the 'cise∣man, and made a day out—Sure as you're <HI>alive</HI>—for which God be thank'd— HETT and I told the whole story—Ne∣ver heard so much laugh at the frolic in your life—When I come to talk of <HI>giving hand at gutter-work,</HI> I thought old Amen would ha' gone into <HI>stericks</HI> —and when I talkt 'bout Lord BLES∣SINGBOURNE's sticking out hinder part,
<PB N="276" REF="277"/>"A'cod," cries Geff. Geehup, "an I had been behind un, I wou'd ha' lent un such a <HI>sisseraro,</HI> that his hinder part should ha' remembered me till Candle∣mass."</P>
<P>But to make short of the story, after a deal more merriment, we closed the whole affair by giving boys a <HI>bunfire;</HI> and what do you think we did—? dash my best buttons, if we did not send little black bag, tossicums, florrididdles, and all into the fire. So here ends the affair of the <HI>bettermost specie</HI>—If you take my advice, GAB, you'll do same. Come and make merry with us. As to our fortun: there is more ways than one to the wood. Let us help poor neighbours—Let us buy bit o' land of one's own—Let us set fatherless he or she up in business—Let us put friendless
<PB N="277" REF="278"/>people in a way—In short, let us do any thing but be <HI>p'lite</HI> and good for nothing. HETT says so too.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. GABRIEL's Answer.</HEAD>
<P>I PERFECTLY approximate to my beloved brother's last sentiments. I see plainly that a quiet corner, and philosophical soul are the best of bless∣ings. Helter-Skelter-Hall cannot be more dear to you, than Sombre Hedges are to <HI>him</HI> who is thy tenderly frater∣nally affectionate friend. I gave an en∣tertainment last night, without sixpence expence, to better society that ever were seen at Prudence-Place, if we except the Colonel, his guardian, and Miss DE GREY. Who, thinketh my bro∣ther,
<PB N="279" REF="280"/>was at my banquet? Even some of the greatest men of all antiquity— Homer, Horace, Cicero, and Seneca— <HI>Such</HI> friends will I never more leave, unless it is to visit my relations at Helter-Skelter-Hall.</P>
<P>I will suffer the sacred dust again to gather around my dwelling. I will again nurse my frugal blaze, and trim my decent lamp—I will once more plant the pensive yew, the oak o'er∣shadowing, and the willow grey— Pensive pleasures shall again be mine, and those, who love the bustling of the world, shall not, if they are <HI>pinch'd,</HI> want a protector — Yes, HENRY — beloved HENRY—I am now refixed for life—My old woman shed a tear at my return—my cat rubb'd, fondling, her tabby sides against me, and, if it had
<PB N="280" REF="281"/>been possible, my dog would have spoke my welcome.</P>
<P>Again are you addressed by the dusky gentleman of Sombre Hedges, who is resolved to play no more the truant.</P>
<P>My <HI>bag</HI> (and other instruments of my folly) I shall not <HI>burn,</HI> but I have fixed it, in the deepest disgrace, upon a peg op∣posite my study, that it may ever be saying, or seeming to say unto me— Oh GABRIEL, GABRIEL, be contented with thy own hair, and the best authors; though thou wert to be tempted by bags of <HI>gold</HI> instead of silk—</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CXXVII. Mr. MEDWAY to Colonel CARLISLE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">(Dated two months after his departure from Prudence-Place.)</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Colonel,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been the constant companion of this charming widow ever since we left your house. There is something about her that attaches me to her, but no circumstance so much, as that she has lost her fortune, and buried the fellow, who deprived her of it, decently. I do not know how it is,
<PB N="282" REF="283"/>but she has got a stronger hold of my heart than ever your LUCIA had. The plague of it is, I suspect, she still likes you—yet I struck a bold stroke yes∣terday—</P>
<P>Mark it.</P>
<P>"Hush, hush, AUGUSTA," said I, "it is not to be expected that OLLY MEDWAY should please your eye, after such a fine-formed fellow as CLEMENT CARLISLE, but he is engaged, you know—With respect to the Marquis, no noise, child, about him. He is not worth keeping terms of mourning with —I despise the black custom of seem∣ing to lament, when one ought to jump for joy—Now the case stands thus: Can you behave well enough to OLLY MEDWAY, not to call him at every
<PB N="283" REF="284"/>third word, CLEMENT CARLISLE? If you say you don't love the said CLE∣MENT, I should hate you: but can you take for a husband a man who loves him as much as <HI>you</HI> ought?"</P>
<P>"I believe, for <HI>his</HI> sake, and Miss <HI>De Grey's,</HI>" replied she, sighing, "I could."</P>
<P>"But what do you sigh for then?"</P>
<P>"P'shaw—will Mr. MEDWAY com∣ply with my terms?"</P>
<P>"Name them."</P>
<P>"Will he reconduct me to the house of Signora —, at Italy?"</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="285"/>
"No noise—Shall I order a chaise to the door?"</P>
<P>"Yes."</P>
<P>"Hush."</P>
<P>Damn it, CARLISLE, she sigh'd <HI>again.</HI> But what a poor reduced rascal I must be! I like her well enough to take her any way.</P>
<P>"You must excuse," said she, "now and then a sigh—Even Miss DE GREY did not frown at me for that."</P>
<P>Confusion, CARLISLE, a tear, which I caught upon my lip, followed this
<PB N="285" REF="286"/>remark. But what's a more childish trick still, the water came running from my eyes too.</P>
<P>Willing to get her a thousand miles from Prudence-Place, I am going to order a chaise.</P>
<P>I know no more than you, what will be the result of it; but I will follow my humour, were it to lead me to the end of the earth and the water.</P>

I shall certainly have her in a short time—at least by the hand, and, if you don't interrupt me, perhaps by the heart.—Send word when you are married—That will be my cue. If you ever come to Rome, I will
<PB N="288" REF="289"/>move with the Marchioness further still, and if you resolve to pursue me, I will cut your throat. I did intend to give my money to <HI>your</HI> LUCIA, but I shall now give it to <HI>my</HI> AUGUSTA. Hush— I'll follow my humour.
