<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE author of the following poem is apprehensive, that neither he nor the objects of his satire, are of consequence enough to engage attention to so long a piece as he has been drawn into by the nature of his subject; but as he has been pestered with defamatory pieces for several months past, with ROSCIADS, APOLOGIES, MURPHYADS, MERETRICIADS, &amp;c &amp;c. &amp;c. and as it must be imagined that the men, who have miscarried of all these libels have found encouragement from some sorts of readers, it is now hoped that they who have afforded leisure for a perusal of the pieces against the present writer, will do him the justice to hear him speak for himself. He is sorry that he has been obliged to employ his time in this sort of controversy, which he despises as a thing illiberal in itself, dishonourable to letters, and generally the mean subterfuge of those who want to make a livelihood of an author's name; but he thought the rancour discharged against him merited a retort, not for the mischief it had done, but on account of the malignity of the design. Excited by this motive, he took up the pen, and as Mr. POPE says of his imitations of Horace, he thought an answer upon BOILEAU'S model would be more full, and of more dignity than any he could have made in his own person. He has only to add, that he does not intend to maintain these peo∣ple by carrying on a paper-war; for unless he has some extreme
<PB REF="3"/>provocation, and that too with more wit than they have hitherto ex∣erted, he is determined to look down upon them with a contemp∣tuous silence for the future; his writings, should they attack them, will speak, though feebly, for themselves; and his morals, if tra∣duced, will falsify their slander, and tell each of them aloud (to use the words adopted by a noble prelate on a similar occasion) <HI>Mentiris Impudentissime!</HI></P>

<POSTSCRIPT>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> The Reader will observe that <HI>EXPOSTULATION</HI> stands at the Head of the Poem, though changed for another Word in the Title-Page; and this must be accounted for.—The very Men who provoked the Author to this Piece began to crouch from the Lash as soon as they heard it was hanging over them; and to weaken its Effect, they immediately advertised a Poem, called <HI>The EX∣POSTULATION.</HI> It was therefore thought proper not to cancel what was then printed off, but (to prevent the Confusion of two Pieces with the same Name) to give the subsequent Poem a new Title-Page; and now the Sons of Darkness are welcome to avail themselves of their Design, truly worthy of such liberal Men!</P>

<L>Who do'st each function and each thought inspire,</L>
<L>Who now impell'st me into scenes of strife,</L>
<L>Now wiser bid'st me seek the calms of life;</L>
<L>With thee, my mind, now must I converse hold,</L>
<L>And all I think and feel shall now be told.</L>
<L>Too long my indolence forbore to weed</L>
<L>Thy rankling faults, which now have grown to seed.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5"/>
But since at length you've fairly rouz'd my gall;</L>
<L>Now hear your own, my friend, and once for all.</L>

<L>To hear thee in thy wild capricious vein,</L>
<L>At dulness rail, the cause of wit sustain;</L>
<L>Discourse of authors, and decide their fate,</L>
<L>Important master of each learn'd debate!</L>
<L>And boldly thunder out thy classic lore,</L>
<L>We'd swear above all modern fame you soar;</L>
<L>For just expression, and conception true,</L>
<L>For genius, taste, and spirit — who but you?</L>
<L>You, one would think, in this degen'rate time,</L>
<L>Alone shou'd wear the meed of sacred rhyme,</L>
<L>And boast, (so freely all around you deal)</L>
<L>No pore to smart at, and no nerve to feel.</L>
<L>But I, who know your very inmost part;</L>
<L>(Come, sit you down, and let me wring your heart!)</L>
<L>Yes I, who know which way your folly tends,</L>
<L>Who count your vices at my fingers ends;</L>
<L>Laugh in my sleeve, whene'er so pert and vain,</L>
<L>You dogmatise in high <HI>Parnassian</HI> strain;</L>
<L>Or, when incens'd, your neighbours faults you scan,</L>
<L>Forget the author, and dissect the man:</L>
<L>No barrister harrangues with half your spleen;</L>
<L>When lords refuse her, not Miss F — D so keen.</L>
<L>But tell me, Sir, does heav'n thy breast inspire</L>
<L>With emanations of aetherial fire?</L>

Does that fine phrenzy in thy bosom roll</L>
<L>Which fires a genius, and pervades his soul?</L>

<L>Shew him with all his subjects blessings crown'd,</L>
<L>In war victorious, and in arts renown'd.</L>
<L>Tell how the Muses with a gen'rous strife,</L>
<L>Rouze at his voice, and waken into life.</L>
<L>Swell, at his word, the <HI>Rhine</HI> with <HI>Gallic</HI> blood,</L>
<L>And bid thy verse devolve a crimson flood.</L>
<L>Sing how the <HI>Indian,</HI> near the rising day,</L>
<L>Lays down his arms, and venerates his sway.</L>
<L>What, tho' <HI>Apollo</HI> should his aid refuse,</L>
<L>You'll shew, at least, a kind good-natur'd muse.</L>

Perhaps may sell (reflect what gain 'twill bring ye)</L>
<L>An ounce of incense for a solid guinea;</L>
<L>But I, you'll say, your feeble pow'rs invite</L>
<L>To regions that demand an eagle's flight.</L>
<L>A <HI>British</HI> king should have a muse of fire;</L>
<L>To sing <HI>Augustus</HI> calls for <HI>Virgil</HI>'s lyre:</L>
<L>But LLOYD and I, who, without <HI>Phoebus'</HI> aid,</L>
<L>Are doom'd to follow still the rhyming trade;</L>
<L>A theme so lofty we can ne'er rehearse,</L>

<L>Nothing dishonours like insipid praise.</L>

<L>And thus, my mind, thus would you hide your spleen,</L>

<L>And be the rhyming blockhead of a court,</L>
<L>Than strive with wit to say the piercing thing,</L>
<L>And dart your soul in each envenom'd sting?</L>
<L>Hop'st thou to rival <HI>Pope</HI>'s immortal page,</L>
<L>And smile at folly in a future age?</L>

<L>Books once admir'd, now with'ring in decay;</L>

<L>And taste, or true or false, prolong their date;</L>
<L>Grant that your foes may all well-nich'd in rhyme,</L>

<L>Yet, while you live, if mankind hate or fear,</L>
<L>What can avail the laurel on your bier?</L>
<L>Slow comes, if warfare is the author's doom,</L>
<L>Slow comes the praise engraven on his tomb.</L>
<L>What daemon then inflames your angry fits?</L>
<L>Why wage a war with blockheads, or with wits?</L>
<L>Th' envenom'd shaft they've levell'd at your name;</L>
<L>Has the blow reach'd you? — have they hurt your same?</L>
