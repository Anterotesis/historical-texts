<HEAD>MALAYAN ISLES.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE who consult the map of this portion of the globe, will instantly perceive the effect of the rapid dis∣charge of the waters after the destruction of the old world by the deluge, aided by volcanic fury. Volcanoes, or ves∣tiges of volcanoes, are to be seen in most parts to this day; amazing caverns, mountains piled upon mountains, with all the testimonies of the mighty confusion; we know not the ante∣cedent form, but it was evidently shattered by that great event. From the top of the bay of <HI>Bengal</HI> to the very pole, it swept every thing before it, and left a vast expanse of ocean, uninter∣rupted by any land, except the diminutive spots of <HI>Kerguelin</HI> islands, or the lesser speck of <HI>Amsterdam</HI> and <HI>St. Paulo.</HI></P>
<P>FROM Cape <HI>Negrais,</HI> the southern point of <HI>Pegu,</HI> the waters seem to have been impelled towards the vast <HI>Pacific Ocean.</HI> The isles of <HI>Andaman</HI> and <HI>Nicobar</HI> first shew that tendency in a slight degree; all the peninsula of <HI>Malacca</HI> was affected in a higher. The island of <HI>Sumatra</HI> follows the curvature of that part of the continent. At <HI>Java</HI> it begins to shew the sury of the
<PB N="2" REF="10"/>attracted course of the waters towards the east. <HI>Java, Cumbava, Timor,</HI> the <HI>Molucca</HI> islands, and <HI>New Guinea</HI> were formed by their influence. At <HI>New Guinea</HI> the torrent took a southerly direction, and rent into fragments all that part of the primitive world, even to the remotest of the <HI>Society</HI> islands, which, like the train of a comet, shew the innumerable remnants of land, most evident witnesses of its course. The amazing island of <HI>New Holland</HI> resisted the force, and continues, more worthy of the name of a continent. <HI>New Zealand</HI> remains divided from all the rest; to the east is sea as far as <HI>America,</HI> and remote as the pole itself on the south. The north part of the vast <HI>Pacific</HI> is contracted by the ap∣proximation of <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>America.</HI> The crescent of islands from <HI>Alaschka</HI> to <HI>Kamtschatka</HI> mark the antient union of the present continents. The flood formed from the south of <HI>Kamtschatka</HI> the <HI>Kuril</HI> isles, <HI>Matmay,</HI> and <HI>Japan, Liqueo</HI> and <HI>Formosa,</HI> the <HI>Philippine</HI> islands, the great <HI>Borneo,</HI> and all the groups scattered over the ocean to the north-east, such as the <HI>Pelew,</HI> the <HI>La∣drones,</HI> and the <HI>Carolinas,</HI> and the range named after Lord <HI>Mul∣grave.</HI> Such is the hypothetical view of this face of the globe.</P>
<P><HI>Sumatra,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SUMATRA.</NOTE> the first island which strikes our eye, bounds the west side of the streights of <HI>Malacca.</HI> The equator crosses it in the middle, and divides it into almost two equal parts. <HI>Acheen</HI> head lies in Lat. 5° 33′ north, and <HI>Hogs</HI> point in 5° 5′ south. The length is about eight hundred miles, and the greatest breadth a hundred and thirty. All the western side is very low, and in∣tersected with swamps, insulating certain patches slightly ele∣vated. A range of mountains runs through the whole island, much nearer to the western than the eastern coast. In some
<PB N="3" REF="11"/>places they are double and treble, with beautiful vallies between each chain; but, excepting where cleared, both valley and mountain are clothed with shady forests. These chains approxi∣mate to the coast on the whole of the western side. At their foot is low, and often swampy land.</P>
<P>SOME of the mountains are of a vast height; <HI>Ophir,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MOUNT OPHIR.</NOTE> situated immediately under the line, is 13,842 feet high, or two miles one thousand and ninety-four yards. No snow is ever seen on it, yet the inhabitants of all the chains are, like those of other alpine regions, subject to monstrous wens or <HI>goitres:</HI> this malady owes its origin to the water, or the thick, cold, and foggy vapors which universally arise from the vallies. These people are not infested with any particular disease, the result of the tumors; they enjoy the same health as others;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BAD CLIMATE.</NOTE> but the climate of <HI>Sumatra</HI> near to the sea, or amidst the swamps, is dreadful. "Near <HI>Indrapour,</HI>" says <HI>Lind</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Essay on Diseases, p. 79.</NOTE>,
<Q>is a place where no <HI>European</HI> can venture to sleep one night on shore during the rainy season without running the hazard of his life, or at least of a dangerous fit of sickness; and at <HI>Podang,</HI> a <HI>Dutch</HI> settlement on the same island, the air has been found so bad, that it is commonly called the <HI>Plague Coast.</HI> Here a thick pestilential vapor or fog arises after the rains, from the marshes, which destroys all the white inha∣bitants.</Q></P>
<P>IN all these chains are numbers of volcanoes,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">VOLCANOES.</NOTE> which are called by the <HI>Malayes, Goonong Appee;</HI> they generally smoke, but sel∣dom emit flames or <HI>lava</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Marsden</HI>'s <HI>Sumatra,</HI> p. 22.</NOTE>. I believe no accurate observations have been yet made on their nature, being at a considerable
<PB N="4" REF="12"/>distance inland, and the approach impeded by deep and almost impenetrable forests. Sulphur may be collected in any quantity about their sides.</P>
<P>THE island abounds with minerals.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MINERALS.</NOTE> It has been long famous for its gold;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">GOLD.</NOTE> some is dug out of the earth; but by reason of the unwholesomeness of the climate, no <HI>Europeans</HI> dare attempt to work, and the natives are too lazy to go to any depth. The greatest part is taken out of the rivers, and washed from the sand and gravel. The amount brought annually to the western parts of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> does not exceed ten thousand ounces. <HI>Menanga∣cabow,</HI> a central and principal kingdom, has the greatest quan∣tity, the richest mines lying within its territory. The <HI>Malayes</HI> are most skilful artists in works of fillagree, in both gold and silver. Mr. <HI>Marsden</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sumatra,</HI> p. 141.</NOTE> gives an ample account of the manufac∣ture, which, with the coarsest of instruments, is carried on to the most amazing degree of elegance and perfection. On mention of that gentleman, let me own my obligation to his admirable his∣tory of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> for most of the articles on the subject of that island.</P>
<P>I FIND no mention of any silver being found here;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">COPPER.</NOTE> but it produces abundance of copper, of the richest kind.</P>
<P>TIN is met with in vast plenty,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TIN.</NOTE> chiefly near <HI>Palambang,</HI> on the east coast, and on the isle of <HI>Banka;</HI> it is a considerable ar∣ticle of trade, and, smelted into small pieces, is exported in great quantities to <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>IRON is found in <HI>Menangacabow,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">IRON.</NOTE> where it is fused for use.</P>
<P>COAL is a production of <HI>Sumatra.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">COAL.</NOTE> <HI>Naptha,</HI> or earth oil, is
<PB N="5" REF="13"/>another, and is principally used to resist the ravages of the <HI>termes,</HI> or white ants.</P>
<P>SALTPETRE is procured in abundance out of the vast caverns with which the island is hollowed, and is extracted out of the dung of the swallows called <HI>Layang Layang,</HI> which build by thousands in the roofs. These seem to be the kind which make the escu∣lent nests. The dung extends often twenty feet in breadth, and is from four to six feet in depth.</P>
<P><HI>Napal,</HI> or the Steatites earth, forms the basis of the cliffs, and often the beds of the rivers.</P>
<P>I SHALL now pursue the other parts of the natural history, begin with the zoology, and treat of it on the authority of Mr. <HI>Marsden,</HI> flinging it into a systematic form.</P>
<P>THE Horses are small and hardy;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">HORSES, COWS, SHEEP.</NOTE> the cows and sheep are also small; the last supposed to be of the <HI>Bengal</HI> breed.</P>
<P>THE <HI>buffalo,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BUFFALO.</NOTE> or <HI>carbow,</HI> the most useful animal of the island, is the beast of draught, and supplies the inhabitants with milk and butter. There are none at present in a state of nature.</P>
<P>DOMESTIC <HI>goats</HI> are common, and are called <HI>Cambing.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">GOATS.</NOTE> As to the <HI>Cambing Ootan,</HI> or goat of the woods, of Mr. <HI>Marsden,</HI> his description is not sufficient for me to ascertain the <HI>species:</HI> "One," says he
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sumatra,</HI> p. 93.</NOTE>,
<Q>which I saw, was three feet in height, and four feet in the length of the body. It had something of the <HI>gazelle</HI> in its appearance; and, excepting the horns, which were about six inches long, and turned back with an arch, it did not much resemble the common goat. The hinder parts were shaped like those of a bear, the rump sloping round off
<PB N="6" REF="14"/>from the back. The tail was very small, and ended in a point. The legs clumsy. The hair along the ridge of the back rising coarse and strong, almost like bristles. No beard. Over the shoulder was a large spreading tuft of greyish hair; the rest of the hair black throughout. The <HI>Scrotum</HI> globular. Its dis∣position seemed wild and fierce, and it is said by the natives to be remarkably swift.</Q></P>
<P>THE <HI>deer</HI> seem to be the different sort of <HI>axis,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">DEER.</NOTE> Hist. Quad. i. p. 117. Mr. <HI>Marsden</HI> names it the <HI>Hog-deer,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 59, but certainly not the <HI>Baby-rossa,</HI> as he supposes it, which we shall hereafter shew to be a hog.</P>
<P>THE <HI>wild boar</HI> is frequent;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">WILD BOAR.</NOTE> the domestic is of the kind we call the <HI>Chinese.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>one-horned Rhinoceros</HI> is common.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">RHINOCEROS.</NOTE> Mr. <HI>Charles Miller</HI> informed me by a friend, that the <HI>two-horned,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 80, is some∣times seen here.</P>
<P>THE forests abound with <HI>elephants:</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ELEPHANTS.</NOTE> few are applied to use; about ten are kept for state by the king of <HI>Acheen;</HI> and that faithful traveller, Mr. <HI>Forrest</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voy. p. 58.</NOTE>, adds, that the inhabitants of the capital make use of them as horses in their journies into the country. Much of the ivory is sent to <HI>China</HI> and to <HI>Europe.</HI> The wild elephants collect in great herds, and are very destructive in the plantations. The natives contrive to poison them, by in∣serting a fatal drug into the sugar-canes, split for that purpose.</P>
<P>OF the digitated quadrupeds are found variety of <HI>apes:</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">APES.</NOTE> the <HI>Gibbon,</HI> or long-armed, N<SUP>o</SUP> 88, in vast multitudes, generally perched by hundreds on the tops of trees, and very seldom de∣scending.
<PB N="7" REF="15"/>The <HI>Ourang Outang</HI> is said to be found in <HI>Sumatra,</HI> which is probable, as it is met with in the adjacent islands. The <HI>pig-tailed Baboon,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 102, is an inhabitant of this country.</P>
<P>AMONG the <HI>Battas</HI> are numbers of small black dogs,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">DOGS.</NOTE> with erect ears, which are fattened for food. Wild dogs inhabit all parts of the island.</P>
<P><HI>Tigers</HI> are numerous, and very destructive;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TIGERS.</NOTE> they annually kill in the pepper country a hundred people; there are even in∣stances of their depopulating whole villages; yet the natives will not destroy them, for they hold the doctrine of transmigration, and fear that in the tiger they may hurt the soul of an an∣cestor.</P>
<P>HERE are two or three species of lesser kind, called tiger cats.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Bear,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 209, is small and black,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BEARS.</NOTE> and devours the heart or pith of the coco-palms.</P>
<P><HI>Otters</HI> and <HI>civets</HI> finish the list given us of the rapacious ani∣mals of this island.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">OTTER.</NOTE> Mr. <HI>Marsden</HI> mentions an animal called a Stinkard, I suppose one of the <HI>mephitic</HI> weesels.</P>
<P>THE crested <HI>Porcupine,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 314, and I think the <HI>long-tailed,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PORCUPINE.</NOTE> N<SUP>o</SUP> 316, are found in this country.</P>
<P><HI>Squirrels</HI>

<P>THE vast <HI>Bats,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 495, or N<SUP>o</SUP> 496, swarm here,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BATS.</NOTE> as they do in all the islands. They fly from island to island, and in their
<PB N="8" REF="16"/>passage are often seen dipping into the sea, probably to snatch up the smaller fishes.</P>
<P>IT is very difficult to ascertain the birds;
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>RDS.</NOTE> I can readily suppose them to be the same with those of <HI>India,</HI> or the neighboring islands. I shall mention only two; one, the scarce species the <HI>Argus Pheasant,</HI> spoken of before among the <HI>Chinese</HI> birds
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Outlines of the Globe, vol. iii. p. 195.</NOTE>; I here add, that it is very common in the woods of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>THE other bird is the <HI>Cassowary, Latham,</HI> iii. p. 10. tab. 72. This curious genus is related to the Ostrich, but is most local, being confined to the torrid zone, and only to that part which includes this island, <HI>Java, Banda,</HI> and a few others of this great <HI>Archipelago.</HI> It runs fast, is very fierce when in the wild state; grunts like a hog, and will kick violently like the Ostrich. Its food is vegetables, but will swallow iron, stones, or any thing that is offered.</P>
<P>I SHALL take notice of only one insect,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">INSECTS.</NOTE> which is the common bee, the <HI>Apis Mellifica,</HI> which in these hot countries is left to it∣self unhived. Vast quantities of the wax is exported to <HI>China, Bengal,</HI> and other parts of <HI>India;</HI> as to the honey it is far inferior to the <HI>European</HI> kind.</P>
<P>I MAY mention that among the lizards is the <HI>Crocodile,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CROCODILE.</NOTE> which makes dreadful havock among the bathers, who cannot be per∣suaded from the performance of that rite notwithstanding the danger; besides, they look upon these terrible reptiles with a de∣gree of respect, probably for the same reason as they do the tiger.</P>
<P><HI>Sumatra</HI> still wants its florist. I must content myself with

<P><HI>Pepper</HI> is the great staple of the island.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PEPPER.</NOTE> It was for the sake of that spice that we defied the wretched climate. Mr. <HI>Marsden</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sumatra, p. 105.</NOTE> gives a long and curious account of its cultivation; he also informs us that the white is only black stripped of the outer coat.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Piper Betel</HI> is cultivated greatly,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BETEL.</NOTE> and sent to the coast of <HI>Coromandel,</HI> and to <HI>Telinga,</HI> for the purpose of chewing, wrapped round the <HI>Areca,</HI> as we have already mentioned

<P>THE <HI>Arundo Bambos</HI> is very common,

<P>THE <HI>Calamus Rotang, Rumphius,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ROTANG.</NOTE> vol. v. p. 97. tab. 51. and num∣bers of the following pages and plates, furnishes annually great cargoes, chiefly from the eastern side of the island, which the <HI>Dutch</HI> send to <HI>Europe,</HI> and the country traders to the western parts of <HI>India.</HI> The specific name <HI>(Rotang)</HI> signifies in the <HI>Malayan</HI> language a <HI>staff</HI> or <HI>walking stick;</HI> the common thick canes which serve for this purpose, and the small limber canes imported from <HI>India,</HI> are all varieties of the <HI>Calamus Rotang</HI>—The former is,</P>
<P><HI>Palmi juncus Calapparius, Var.</HI> A. <HI>Linn.</HI> and is accurately de∣scribed by <HI>Rumphius, Amb.</HI> vol. v. p. 97. The texture of its wood, its leaves and flowering stems, bear a striking resemblance to some species of palm. Hence <HI>Rumphius</HI> has not unaptly named it <HI>Palmi juncus,</HI> or <HI>Palm rush.</HI> Its natural situation is in
<PB N="10" REF="18"/>woody mountanous tracts; there it pervades the highest trees, and interlacing its branches from bough to bough, forms, by its innumerable ramifications and spinous stems, an impenetrable thicket.</P>
<P>IN order to fit this cane for the purpose of a walking stick, a single interstice of sufficient length between two joints is made choice of; this is loaded with a weight, or bound tight to a board, for the space of a month, and also exposed to smoak, to diminish somewhat of its natural pliability.</P>
<P><HI>Rumphius</HI> observes, <HI>Herb. Amb.</HI> vol. 5. p. 100, that no author he had seen described this cane, which he imputes to its growing only in the remote parts of <HI>India,</HI> and sequestered mountains, rarely visited by <HI>Europeans,</HI> till they acquired sovereign power over some of the regions.</P>

<P>I SHALL conclude this subject with mentioning that on this coast,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">STRANGE PLANT OF PURCHAS.</NOTE> near <HI>Tappanooly,</HI> Mr. <HI>Charles Miller</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Phil. Trans. vol. lxviii. p. 178.</NOTE> found the
<Q>strange plant,</Q> as <HI>Purchas</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vol. i. p. 152.</NOTE> calls it, discovered by Sir <HI>James Lancaster</HI> on the island of <HI>Sombrero,</HI> who speaks of it as a tree which shrunk into the ground as soon as it was touched. Wonderful things were related of it by our old navigator. It is named, says Mr. <HI>Miller,</HI> by the <HI>Malayes, Lalan-laut,</HI> or sea grass.
<Q>It is found in sandy bays or in shallow water, where it appears like a slender strait stick, but, when you attempt to touch it, im∣mediately withdraws itself into the sand. I could never ob∣serve any <HI>tentacula;</HI> a broken piece near a foot long, which after many unsuccessful attempts, I drew out, was perfectly
<PB N="15" REF="23"/>strait and uniform, and resembled a worm drawn over a knit∣ting needle; when dry it is a coral.</Q></P>
<P>THAT <HI>Sumatra</HI> was known to the antients is most probable, but that only partially. This, and two others which <HI>Ptolemy</HI> unites, seem in the opinion of Mr. <HI>Caverhill</HI> to have been the <HI>Sabaddibae</HI> of the old geographer. The <HI>Mahometan</HI> travellers of the year 1173 called it <HI>Ramni.</HI> They speak of its gold mines, and excellent camphor, and of the inhabitants being cannibals. <HI>Marco Polo</HI> is very diffuse in his account of this island, which he calls the little <HI>Java;</HI> he actually travelled over six of its eight kingdoms, and gives various particulars, long since confirmed by the later travellers. He mentions the custom of eating human flesh; he describes the Rhinoceros under the name of <HI>Licorne,</HI> camphor, sago, the cocoa palms, and the tapping them for the acquisition of the liquor <HI>Toddy,</HI> so necessary a drink to the inha∣bitants.</P>
<P>AFTER a very long interval the <HI>Portuguese</HI> again discovered <HI>Sumatra.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PORTUGUESE.</NOTE> <HI>Lopez Sequeira,</HI> in 1508, by the command of his great master, sailed on a voyage of discovery, and arrived at the port of <HI>Pedeer,</HI> to the east of <HI>Acheen,</HI> at the northern end of the island
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Osorio, vol. p. 368.</NOTE>; there he found ships from <HI>Pegu, Bengal,</HI> and several other countries. The king, a <HI>Mahometan,</HI> treated him with much civility. The great <HI>Albuquerque</HI> visited the island in per∣son, and entered into a treaty with the king of <HI>Pedeer.</HI> The <HI>Portuguese</HI> afterwards engaged deeply in the wars between the petty monarchs of the country; but I do not find that they ever made any settlement.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="24"/>THE <HI>Dutch</HI> followed them in 1595.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">DUTCH.</NOTE> An account of that voyage may be seen in <HI>L'Histoire de la Navigation de L'Inde ori∣entale,</HI> printed at <HI>Amsterdam</HI> in 1609. In future I shall, in my references to those voyages, cite them by the name of <HI>Nicolas</HI>'s collection, who was the publisher. At p. 18 is given an account of their first descent, and a plate of the dresses of the inhabitants. The <HI>Dutch</HI> formed several factories in <HI>Sumatra,</HI> which flourish to this day; the principal is at <HI>Padang,</HI> in the neighborhood of the gold country. Their next is at <HI>Palanbang,</HI> for the sake of the tin which is dug by the natives, and fused on the isle of <HI>Banca,</HI> on the east side of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> opposite to the discharge of the river of <HI>Palambang.</HI> The city stands some miles from the mouth: It once belonged to the king of <HI>Bantam</HI> in <HI>Java,</HI> and is even to this day peopled by <HI>Javans;</HI> but since the <HI>Dutch</HI> have rendered that monarchy in a manner dependant on themselves, they most probably may be styled its masters. Besides making it the magazine of the tin drawn from <HI>Banca,</HI> they collect vast quantities of pepper from the neighboring parts. In 1662 this city was attacked by a <HI>Dutch</HI> fleet sent from <HI>Batavia</HI> to revenge some most barbarous murders committed on their countrymen, it was strongly fortified with trunks of trees closely put together, and mounted with numbers of cannon. Notwithstanding this, the <HI>Dutch</HI> succeeded, and burnt the city to the ground.</P>
<P>THE <HI>English</HI> are at present in possession of the great trade of <HI>Sumatra.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ENGLISH.</NOTE> The reputation of its vast wealth gave rise to the first voyage ever made by our countrymen to the <HI>East Indies. Eliza∣beth,</HI> in the 43d year of her reign, issued her patent which con∣stituted
<PB N="17" REF="25"/>originally the <HI>East India</HI> company. It is given at length by <HI>Purchas</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pilgrimage, vol. i. p. 139.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN consequence of this, that able sailor <HI>James Lancaster,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SIR JAMES LANCASTER.</NOTE> afterwards Sir <HI>James,</HI> was sent there, and sailed from <HI>Torbay</HI> on April 2d, 1601. He commanded the <HI>Dragon</HI> of six hundred tons, and had with him the <HI>Hector</HI> of three hundred, the <HI>Ascen∣sion</HI> of two hundred and sixty, and one more. Her Highness furnished her general, as he was called, with letters to divers of the eastern potentates, among others, one to the king of <HI>Acheen,</HI> the chief and first object of the voyage. He did not arrive at <HI>Su∣matra</HI> till May 2d, 1602. The fame of <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s victories over the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had reached the king's ears, and in consequence <HI>Lancaster</HI> was most favorably received; he presented gifts of great value on the part of his mistress, and received others in return. The <HI>Portuguese</HI> did all in their power to prevent a good under∣standing between the <HI>English</HI> and the king, but to no purpose. <HI>Lancaster</HI> even made a short cruise, and took a rich ship from <HI>Saint Thome</HI> on the <HI>Coromandel</HI> coast, belonging to the <HI>Portu∣guese,</HI> which was deemed a lawful prize, that kingdom being then in possession of our great enemy <HI>Philip</HI> II. Our general got in part of his lading of pepper in this island; the rest in <HI>Ma∣lacca;</HI> and after obtaining many valuable privileges from the king of <HI>Acheen,</HI> returned with a most friendly letter from the <HI>Sumatran</HI> prince. He met with a dreadful storm off <HI>Mada∣gascar;</HI> in the midst of the confusion, he thought of the services he might render to his country by this remarkable notice:
<Q>The passage to the <HI>East Indies</HI> lies in 62 degrees 30 minutes, by the
<PB N="18" REF="26"/>north-west on the <HI>American</HI> side.</Q> After encountering many difficulties, he anchored safe in the <HI>Downs</HI> on September 11th 1603. Sir <HI>James</HI> acquired great wealth and reputation by this voyage, which he lived thirty years after to enjoy, as he well deserved.</P>
<P>WE followed the advantages of this enterprize. The <HI>Dutch</HI> who had settled themselves in the island, entertained the highest jealousy of our rising commerce, and gave all possible oppo∣sition; they even once expelled us from <HI>Bantam,</HI> where we had a factory. We then turned our thoughts towards <HI>Acheen,</HI> and met there some of the island chieftains in the year 1685, who invited us to settle on their lands; this, gave rise to our esta∣blishment at <HI>Bencoolen,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BENCOOLEN.</NOTE> which became the supreme factory. The fort called fort <HI>Marlborough</HI> was founded; we are now the prin∣cipal traders in the island, and export from thence annually twelve hundred tons of pepper, the greatest part to <HI>Europe,</HI> the rest to <HI>China.</HI> This settlement is unwholesome, the air full of malignant vapors; the mountains continually cloathed with thick heavy clouds, which break out in lightning, thunder, rain, and short-lived storms; the fort is tolerably healthy during the sickly season, and to that place the merchants should make their retreat.</P>
<P>IN the year 1760, the <HI>French</HI> admiral <HI>D'Estaign</HI> destroyed this fort, and all our other settlements on the island, in order to drive us from the lucrative pepper trade; but they were soon re-established, and our possessions secured to us in 1763 by the treaty of <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>ON the coast of the <HI>Battas</HI> country are two settlements,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NATAL.</NOTE> one at <HI>Natal,</HI> and another on a small isle in the noble bay of <HI>Tappanoly,</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="27"/>which penetrates deeply inland, and is capable of containing all the navies of <HI>Europe,</HI> so as to ride securely in any weather, with such a multitude of harbors that a large ship could remain concealed so as to elude all search. In this bay is found plenty of that enormous shell the <HI>Keemo</HI> or <HI>Chama Gigas</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bonan i. 83, 84. Argenville, tab. 23. fig, E.</NOTE>, it is often three foot broad, and of the weight of five hundred pounds; and is taken in deep water, by thrusting a long bamboo between the shells while they are gaping, which close, and then are drawn up; the shell is quite white, and worked by the natives like ivory. The fish weighs often thirty pounds, and is excellent when stewed.</P>
<P><HI>Sumatra</HI> is divided into numerous little kingdoms,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ACHEEN.</NOTE> but that of <HI>Acheen</HI> is the most powerful. It once had a strong and nume∣rous fleet, with which it contested the superiority of the sea with the adjacent princes. <HI>Acheen</HI> was the great <HI>emporium</HI> of the island, and the resort of the <HI>Arabs</HI> for the gold, camphor, ben∣zoin, pepper, and all the commercial productions of the country. The government is entirely feudal, being founded on the <HI>Ma∣layan</HI> plan. As to the genuine <HI>Sumatrans</HI> they are called <HI>Orang Ooloo,</HI> or countrymen, from their residence in villages. The <HI>Sultan</HI> of the empire of <HI>Menangecabow,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">EMPIRE OF MENANGECA∣BOW.</NOTE> for a long time reigned lord paramount over all the other princes, who owned their au∣thority to be derived from him: at present his real power is not superior to that of a common Rajah; yet still a superstitious re∣gard is paid to his person; he is sovereign pontiff; the opinion of his sanctity is supported by the <HI>Mahometan</HI> priests, and an
<PB N="20" REF="28"/>air of mystery surrounds his court; he issues out dictatorial edicts, which are received with respect; but attended to no far∣ther than is consistent with the interests or pleasure of them to whom they are addressed. All the <HI>Sumatrans</HI> are originally de∣rived from the <HI>Malayes,</HI> or inhabitants of the peninsula of <HI>Ma∣lacca;</HI> when spoken of in this island, the word <HI>Malaye</HI> implies the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> who chiefly inhabit the coasts. <HI>Mahometanism</HI> is the religion of all the <HI>Malaye</HI> governments; all observe the feudal system,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">FEUDAL CUSTOM.</NOTE> and commute the punishment of crimes for money, which have their price as customary among the <HI>Ger∣mans</HI> and <HI>Britons.</HI> Murder, as well as other crimes, having its price; this custom is a dreadful encouragement, particularly since the <HI>Daltoos</HI> or magistrates receive the ransom. Our factory was desirous of putting a stop to the frequent assassinations, but was told by the <HI>Daltoo</HI> that he should be a loser, as he got twenty dollars a head when the families prosecuted. Some of these governments are very antient, being formed soon after the first population of the island. <HI>Menangecabow</HI> is one which received the <HI>Mahometan</HI> faith in later times from the <HI>Malayes</HI> of <HI>Ma∣lacca,</HI> who had made a conquest of their antecedent brethren.</P>
<P>IN p. 33 of the preceding volume, I have given the general de∣scription of the persons of the <HI>Malayes.</HI> I cannot help thinking that those of <HI>Malacca</HI> were a distinct people, who drove the an∣tient inhabitants of the peninsula to take refuge in <HI>Sumatra,</HI> where they retain their language and alphabet, and that the <HI>Malayes</HI> in future times re-conquered the descendants of these refugees, and each still retain their peculiar language and writing.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="29"/>I SHALL not attempt to give an account of the various na∣tions into which this island is divided:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NATIVES OF THE BATTAS.</NOTE> That of the <HI>Battas</HI> is too remarkable to be overlooked; they are of smaller stature than the rest of the <HI>Sumatrans,</HI> and their complexions fairer; their religion is paganism, yet from very antient custom they hold in respect the sultan of <HI>Menangecabow,</HI> in all probability from the period in which both were of the same religion. We have our settlement on their coast, which enabled two of our factory, Mr. <HI>Charles Miller</HI> and Mr. <HI>Holloway,</HI> to undertake a journey into the interior parts of the country. I refer my reader for the par∣ticular account to the lxviiith volume of the Philosophical Trans∣actions. From this expedition is verified the circumstance of the natives being <HI>anthropophagi,</HI> and eat the flesh of prisoners of war, or of offenders condemned for capital crimes. As soon as the man is put to death, they rush on the body, cut pieces of the yet tremulous limbs, dip it in lemon juice and salt, and eat it with exquisite pleasure. Mr. <HI>Miller</HI> says, they spake in raptures of the soles of the feet, and palms of the hands, as pe∣culiar dainties. <HI>Marco Polo</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bergeron, p. 134.</NOTE> tells us, that in the kingdom of <HI>Dragoiam</HI> they eat the bodies of their relations and best friends who chance to die, thinking it a peculiar respect to the deceased. They then bury the bones in the caverns of the mountains. <HI>Polo</HI> mentions this horrid custom in other islands, so that it cer∣tainly had spread far more extensively than is imagined. The opinion was generally exploded, till the voyages in our days fur∣nished us with several examples; some most dreadful, in which many <HI>Europeans</HI> fell victims to the cannibal appetite: Even the
<PB N="22" REF="30"/>illustrious <HI>Cook</HI> found in part a sepulchre in the maws of the inhabitants of the <HI>Sandwich</HI> islands.</P>
<P>ON the island of <HI>Enganho,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ENGANHO ISLAND.</NOTE> about ninety miles south of fort <HI>Marlborough,</HI> are inhabitants of most savage appearance, and of a language unintelligible to the few who have visited the place. It was scarcely known to have been inhabited, as it was long deemed inaccessible by reason of the rocks, and dreadful break∣ers. Commodore <HI>Beaulieu</HI> calls it <HI>L'Isle Trompeuse,</HI> and adds, that the natives murder all that come on shore. It appears from the <HI>East India</HI> pilot
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. tab. 73.</NOTE> to be of a triangular form. Mr. <HI>Charles Miller</HI> was hardy enough to visit it. He found the men from five feet eight to five feet ten inches high, of a red color, with black strait hair cut short; that of the women long, and rolled into a neat curl on the top of the head. The men went quite naked; the women had no more than a plantain leaf to hide their nakedness; the arms of the men were lances headed with the bone of fish, their canoes made of two boards sewed together, and the seam filled with pitch. Their houses were circular, sup∣ported on stakes of iron-wood; they had no sort of fowl, cattle, or rice; they lived on cocoa nuts, sugar canes, and sweet po∣tatoes, or fish dried in the smoke. The fish they caught with their lances, or in nets very neatly manufactured by themselves. Their behavior was hospitable, nor did they give any sort of um∣brage, till some imprudent conduct on our side excited an alarm. Conch shells, the <HI>Murex Tritonis,</HI> resounded in all parts of the island, and our people thought fit to make a sudden retreat.</P>
<P>A MOST furious surf rises on great part of the western and
<PB N="23" REF="31"/>southern side of <HI>Sumatra,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SURF.</NOTE> such as vexes the western coasts of <HI>Africa.</HI>
<Q>It begins, says Mr. <HI>Marsden</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sumatra, p. 28.</NOTE>, to assume its form at some distance from the place where it breaks, gradually accumu∣lating as it moves forward, till it gains a height, in common, of fifteen to twenty feet, when it overhangs at top, and falls like a cascade, nearly perpendicular, involving itself as it descends; the noise made by the fall is prodigious, and, during the still∣ness of the night, may be heard many miles up the country. It forms sometimes but a single range along the shore; at other times, there is a succession of two, three, four, or more, behind each other, extending perhaps half a mile out to sea. The number of ranges is generally in proportion to the height and violence of the surf.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Java</HI> is separated from the island of <HI>Sumatra,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">JAVA.</NOTE> by the narrow streights of <HI>Sunda;</HI> their depth is from thirty to fifty fathoms, and in some places are no soundings; the voyager is advised of the approach to <HI>Java</HI> by vast drifts of bamboos, and flocks of the booby
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Catesby, i. 87.</NOTE>, or, according to Mr. <HI>Asbeck</HI>'s reference, the <HI>Pelecanus piscator</HI> of <HI>Linnaeus.</HI> The currents are strong in the narrowest part, and from <HI>January</HI> to <HI>April</HI> usually run from the westward; the rest of the year from the eastward.</P>
<P>THE streights begin with great breadth between <HI>Sumanca</HI> bay in <HI>Sumatra,</HI> and <HI>Welcome</HI> bay in <HI>Java. Sumanca</HI> and other peaks mark the former.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PRINCE'S ISLAND.</NOTE> <HI>Prince</HI>'s island lies near the <HI>Javanese</HI> shore, and is known by a small mount called <HI>Java</HI> head, or the <HI>Pico.</HI> The latitude of the anchoring place in <HI>Kasuarus</HI> bay, is 6° 36′ 15″ south. This island is universally wooded, and vegeta∣tion
<PB N="24" REF="32"/>advances so rapidly, that notwithstanding what is cut for the use of the shipping, it seems nothing impaired. It has some in∣habitants so like in figure, color, manners, and even language, to those of the south sea islands, as greatly to strike Captain <HI>Cook,</HI> who anchored here in 1780, after having been so long conversant with them. The chief business of the natives is to supply the shipping with fowls, small tortoises, or green turtle, hog deer weighing about forty pounds; monkies, some vegetables, and above all water.</P>
<P>THIS island is as unhealthy as the rest of these fatal coasts;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ISLAND OF CRACATOA.</NOTE> which has induced many navigators to prefer taking water at the isle of <HI>Cracatoa,</HI> a small spot about nine miles in circum∣ference, and some leagues to the north-east of <HI>Prince</HI>'s island. In one part is a hot spring, used by the natives as a bath. The island is high, rising gradually from the sea, and covered with trees. In the coral reefs which skirt the shores are plenty of small green turtle.</P>
<P>BETWEEN <HI>Hog</HI> point in <HI>Sumatra,</HI> and <HI>Cickorang</HI> in <HI>Java,</HI> the streights suddenly contract. In the middle are the small isles, called <HI>Midchannel</HI> island, the <HI>Isle de Milieu,</HI> and the rock <HI>Le grand Toque. Le Brun</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. 38.</NOTE> calls the breadth a league and a half. After doubling the point,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BANTAM.</NOTE> appears the bay of <HI>Bantam,</HI> deep, round, and sprinkled over with many small isles; at the bottom is the city, capital of the kingdom. After Sir <HI>James Lancaster</HI> left <HI>Acheen</HI> he sailed to this port; the king was one of the <HI>Indian</HI> mo∣narchs whom <HI>Elizabeth</HI> honored with her correspondence; her letter was graciously received. <HI>Lancaster</HI> established here our
<PB N="25" REF="33"/>first factory in the <HI>Indian</HI> seas, and after loading his ship with pepper, took his departure for <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Portuguese</HI> visited this coast in the time of the great <HI>Albuquerque;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PORTUGUESE.</NOTE> the commanders in that expedition were <HI>Roderigo Brittio,</HI> and <HI>Ferdinand Andrada,</HI> who took part with one of the princes of the country, engaged in war with the king of <HI>Ban∣tam,</HI> and gained a great victory over his fleet. Not long after <HI>George Albuquerque</HI> made an attempt to storm <HI>Bantam</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Osorio, vol. ii. p. 346.</NOTE>, but was repulsed with great loss. <HI>Lacsemanna,</HI> the general of <HI>Malacca,</HI> the ablest officer of his age, had the most considerable share in the defeat.</P>
<P>AT the first arrival of the <HI>Europeans, Java</HI> (according to Sir <HI>Thomas Herbert</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P. 200.</NOTE>) was under one supreme, the emperor of <HI>Ma∣tara;</HI> next to him was the king of <HI>Bantam,</HI> whom Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> only styles a viceroy; possibly at first the government might have been like that of the primaeval establishments of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> and in after times the delegated powers assumed an independene.</P>
<P>THE subtil <HI>Dutch</HI> took more efficacious methods to gain footing in the country;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">DUTCH.</NOTE> after various great events, various quar∣rels and reconciliations, by an essential service done in 1680 to one of the monarchs of <HI>Bantam,</HI> they received from him an exclusive grant of the trade of his kingdom. This they support by a slight armed force; in fact, they are real masters of the island, notwithstanding they pay a pretended respect to the na∣tive powers. Before that acquisition of privilege by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Danes</HI> had very flourishing factories, but both were expelled by the influence of their <HI>Batavian</HI> rival.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="34"/><HI>Le Brun</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Travels, vol. ii. p. 109.</NOTE> visited this court in 1706, and exhibits a fine pic∣ture of the effeminacy of the Oriental monarch, illustrating it with a print. All the attendants were females, even his body guards. One is seen with her musket on her shoulder, others with lances. Dancing girls, and two diminutive dwarfs, perform∣ing before his majesty, shew the festivity of the court; let me add that one of the ladies, officers of state, bore the sword, another the golden bowl, and so to the number of ten, each carrying a different badge of state. Near this city he also saw a miracle in this climate; a lady of the age of a hundred-and-thirty.</P>
<P>AFTER passing some leagues to the east, through the group of the <HI>Thousand</HI> isles, we arrive at the bay of <HI>Batavia,</HI> amidst others equally numerous, each named by the <HI>Dutch</HI> in memory of their own country. The traveller would imagine himself in <HI>Holland,</HI> and more so when he enters the great and magnificent city of <HI>Batavia,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BATAVIA.</NOTE> seated in a swamp, as like as possible to their boasted capital <HI>Amsterdam;</HI> but here, overhung with pestilential vapors, that would soon by their fatal effects depopulate the na∣tive country, did not the teeming <HI>Germany</HI> annually pour down the <HI>Rhine</HI> its thousands to supply the loss, in a place so injudici∣ously fixed on through national prejudice. As to the troops, they are picked out of the vagabonds of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> and sent to certain death, for in the space of three years, not five survive out of a battalion of an equal number of hundreds. Let Doctor <HI>Lind</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Essay on Diseases, p. 144.</NOTE> describe the fatal effects of the injudicious selection of situation of this proud capital, on some of the <HI>British</HI> subjects, who unfortunately put in here:
<Q>During the sickly season at
<PB N="27" REF="35"/><HI>Batavia,</HI> a boat belonging to the <HI>Medway,</HI> which attended on shore every night, was three times successively manned, not one having survived that service. They were all taken ill in the night, when on shore, or when returning on board, so that the officers were at length obliged to employ none but the natives of the country on that business.</Q></P>
<P>ON the arrival of the <HI>Europeans</HI> in this country,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">JACATRA.</NOTE> a town then called <HI>Calappa,</HI> and about the year 1607 changed to that of <HI>Jacatra,</HI> stood on the site of <HI>Batavia.</HI> The <HI>regulus</HI> of the place had made an alliance with the <HI>English,</HI> which gave great umbrage to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who had likewise their settlements here, under the protection of a fort or two; the rivals came to action; for a time we had the superiority, and in the year 1619, after a successful battle at sea, compelled the <HI>Dutch</HI> commodore <HI>Koen,</HI> to retreat to <HI>Amboina;</HI> but he soon returned in such force, as to oblige the <HI>English,</HI> by capitulation, totally to evacuate the place. This was not a national war, but carried on entirely be∣tween the two companies.</P>
<P><HI>Koen</HI> utterly destroyed the town of <HI>Jacatra,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">FOUNDED IN 1620.</NOTE> and built in its place the present <HI>Batavia,</HI> on a far more extensive scale. The anniversary is observed in honor of the founder to this day. The streets are regular, each has its canal, which in the dry season emit a most horrid stench, from the filth flung into them, and the closeness of the trees planted on the banks pre∣vent the due circulation. No place could possibly be selected more unwholesome; so that what <HI>Purchas</HI> relates of <HI>Bantam,</HI> may well be applied to this city,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SICKLY CLIMATE.</NOTE>
<Q>that it is not a place to re∣cover
<PB N="28" REF="36"/>men that are sick, but to kill men who come there in health.</Q> The <HI>Jacatra,</HI> and other rivers which creep through the city, almost stagnate. A dead buffalo or hog flung into them, is perhaps many days in reaching the sea. These streams pass through a fenny plain, rising from the <HI>Blauenberg</HI> or blue moun∣tains, about forty miles distant. For the benefit of a quick and easy conveyance of such as are in a convalescent state, an excel∣lent road is formed for seventy miles, leading from <HI>Batavia</HI> to the mountains, equal to any turnpike road in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Batavia</HI> is the seat of the viceroy of the <HI>Indies;</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> support him with a splendor equal to that of most crowned heads, nor does he go out without his guards, magnificently dressed; this is to instil respect into the natives. The town is prodigiously populous; but neither the public or the private buildings are particularly fine; they possibly are in the same state as they were in the time of Mr. <HI>Nieuhoff,</HI> who in his tra∣vels
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Churchill's Col. vol. ii.</NOTE> has given views of many of both kinds. The whole city is surrounded with gardens for a great distance, and the canals, cut far into the interior of the island, serve to convey all sorts of provisions to market; many forts are dispersed over the country to awe the inhabitants.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Chinese,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MASSACRE OF THE CHINESE.</NOTE> attracted by the sweets of gain, settled here in vast numbers; they are said to have had, in the year 1726, two thou∣sand four hundred houses in the city and suburbs, some of which were the best in <HI>Batavia;</HI> many of them were levelled to the ground in the infamous massacre of this nation in the year 1740. It began on occasion of the celebration of a festival in
<PB N="29" REF="37"/>honor of their idol, the <HI>Jootsje de Batavia,</HI> a hideous likeness of the Devil (the <HI>Dutch</HI> only worshipped him in private); the en∣thusiasm of the devotees created disorder; they grew riotous, and a guard sent to restrain their zeal, executed its commission with great vigor, which excited the rage of the <HI>Chinese,</HI> so that much blood was shed. The governor and council, under pretence of public security, ordered every <HI>Chinese</HI> to be put to the sword, women and children excepted; reduced to despair, they set fire to their own houses; numbers perished in the flames, and those who rushed out were put to death by the soldiery; above twelve thousand perished in this horrible affair. The <HI>Dutch</HI> published their account, which is left to the judgment of the reader to be∣lieve or disbelieve; they would make the cause to have been a regular conspiracy, yet the governor, two of the counsellors of the <HI>Indies,</HI> and the attorney general, were deposed and impri∣soned; the <HI>Dutch</HI> certainly thought them guilty. The wealth of the <HI>Chinese</HI> seems to have been the inducement to the bloody business. The governor's effects, which he was endeavoring to carry to <HI>Europe,</HI> amounted to half a million sterling. So little were the <HI>Dutch</HI> apprehensive of any harm from a new coloniza∣tion of the <HI>Chinese,</HI> that they permitted any number which pleased to settle again in <HI>Batavia,</HI> and multitudes resorted there as if nothing had happened. The governor thought proper to send an apology to the emperor of <HI>China,</HI> which he received with unconcern, considering that his empire was overcharged with inhabitants, and indifferent to subjects who had deserted the tombs of their ancestors.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Chinese</HI> seem to have been on the best footing with the
<PB N="30" REF="38"/><HI>Dutch.</HI> In 1632, they gave a proof of their respect by having a noble medal struck in honor of the governor, <HI>James Speks.</HI> On one side is the plan of <HI>Batavia;</HI> on the reverse a <HI>Chinese</HI> inscrip∣tion, and beneath the following Latin translation:

<P>IN all instances of real rebellions,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">DUTCH CRUELTY.</NOTE> and of the punishment of the slaves, a spirit of cruelty pervades the <HI>Batavians</HI> beyond the inhabitants of any other settlements; penetrate but into a grove near <HI>Batavia,</HI> and hundreds of naked corpses will be seen hang∣ing on the trees, by their legs, arms, or necks, all lacerated by the rapacious birds, and emitting the most pestilential stench; no notice is taken of the death of a slave: the <HI>Dutchman</HI> scarcely ever suffers for any crime. Sir <HI>Thomas Herbert</HI> is perhaps too severe on this city, when he calls it "a second <HI>Sodom."</HI></P>
<P>BESIDES <HI>Batavia,</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> have numbers of smaller settle∣ments on the coast, to collect the rich productions of the island. At <HI>Tsierobon</HI> is one, which country is governed by a depen∣dent sultan. He furnishes them with the productions of his
<PB N="31" REF="39"/>dominions; an immense quantity of rice, coffee, sugar, pepper, cotton, and <HI>Areca;</HI> all these are bought at the price the con∣sciences of the company fix, which is certainly not at the highest rate. False weights are in general use with the company's ser∣vants, nor are they in any danger of being called to account, as it tends to the service of their congenial masters.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PEPPER.</NOTE> Pepper is the great commodity of the island; <HI>Bantam</HI> furnishes the <HI>Dutch</HI> with three millions of pounds annually.</P>
<P>LET us now pass on the the island of <HI>Madura,</HI> in Lat. 7° south.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Dutch</HI> picked a quarrel with its prince in the year 1747,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PRINCE OF MADURA, HIS TRAGICAL STORY.</NOTE> who, after seeing his country invaded, his subjects massacred, and his own ruin to be certain, collected all his treasures, and with his young son, wives, concubines, and a few select friends, fled to <HI>Borneo</HI> in hopes of an asylum. He was closely pursued, but by putting into creeks and inlets, for a short time escaped; the unhappy fugitives set sail in the night, and retreated into their hiding places in the day. At length, to their great joy, they saw a ship with <HI>English</HI> colors. They flung themselves on the pro∣tection of the commander, who received the prince and his trea∣sure. The <HI>Dutch Guarda costa</HI> came up with him; as he knew force could not prevale, he by treachery seized on the <HI>English</HI> captain, put him into irons, nor would he set him at liberty, till the unhappy prince was delivered into the power of his ene∣mies. Grown desperate, he barricaded the cabin; it was forced open; jealous of the honor of his women, he stabbed two to the heart; others equally delicate flung themselves over board. Oppressed with numbers, and greatly wounded, the aged sultan was seized, and conveyed to <HI>Batavia,</HI> and from thence to the
<PB N="32" REF="40"/>wretched island of <HI>Robben,</HI> near the cape of <HI>Good Hope</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Forster's Voy. ii. 556.</NOTE>, where he was living in <HI>April</HI> 1775, dragging on a miserable being, in the character of a common slave. Whoever wishes to have a fuller account of this tragical and infamous event, may find it patheti∣cally told in a voyage to the <HI>East Indies,</HI> 1747, 1748, published in 1762: the perusal will be a trial of the heart of the reader.</P>
<P><HI>Balimbuan</HI> is another little kingdom,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SAME OF THE PRINCE OF BALIMBUAN.</NOTE> at the eastern extremity of the island. It seems that the <HI>Dutch,</HI> apparently without any motives of emolument, attacked also the prince of this country; he defended himself vigorously for two years, was overpowered, himself confined for life in the castle of <HI>Batavia,</HI> his family torn from him, and sent to keep company with the <HI>Madurian</HI> prince at <HI>Robben</HI> island.</P>
<P><HI>Matara,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MATARA.</NOTE> the capital of the once potent empire of that name, is in about Lat. 8° 12′, on the south side of <HI>Java.</HI> Even this em∣pire was, after many contests, rendered dependent on the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who having deposed the usurping sovereign, placed the rightful heir on the throne; but they chose for him his place of resi∣dence, secured his allegiance by a citadel, and supplying him with every conveniency for his pleasures, rendered this weak prince entirely subservient to their will. In this part of the island is plenty of <HI>Teek,</HI> and timber for the building of ships, or for exportation to other parts of <HI>India;</HI> here they have their docks; besides they carry on great commerce in rice, salt, pepper, and many other valuable productions.</P>
<P><HI>Java</HI> wants its <HI>Marsden;</HI> but with such lights as I can pro∣cure, I shall attempt a brief description of this important island.
<PB N="33" REF="41"/><HI>Marco Polo</HI> is very concise in his account of it, which he names simply <HI>Java</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bergeron, p. 130.</NOTE>. In his days there was only one monarch. It was greatly frequented by merchants for the sake of the pepper and other spices; he mentions nutmegs, which probably have been since extirpated by the political <HI>Dutch. James Bontius,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BONTIUS.</NOTE> a physician of great eminence, who flourished here very soon after the foundation of <HI>Batavia</HI> by <HI>Koen,</HI> has furnished very good materials for the medical and natural history of the island. It is from a variety of authors I must select accounts relative to other subjects.</P>
<P><HI>Java</HI> extends from <HI>West Point,</HI> in Lat. 6° 36′ south,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">EXTENT OF JAVA.</NOTE> Long. 121° 33′ from <HI>Paris,</HI> to <HI>East Point,</HI> in Lat. 8° 33′ Long. 132°, near seven hundred miles in length. The course is west and east, with an inclination to the south; the greatest breadth is about forty leagues, and nearly of equal diameter, except where the bays make some small contractions.</P>
<P>THE land on the coasts varies; at the western and eastern ex∣tremities it is high, but I believe in general the shores are low, swampy, and unhealthy. A lofty chain of mountains runs from west to east through the middle, with numbers of branches issuing from each side to uncertain distances from the sea. Some of the mountains are very lofty, and the air cool and salubrious; among them are very active volcanoes;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">VOLCANOES.</NOTE> the mountain of <HI>Parang</HI> is the principal, and said to be very productive of gold; the <HI>Dutch</HI> spent near a million in attempting the discovery, but were dis∣appointed in their search; these mountains produce besides <HI>Ru∣bies</HI> and <HI>Sapphires.</HI> Earthquakes are frequent and dreadful.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="42"/>I AM not qualified to give any account of the natives of these <HI>Appennines</HI> of <HI>Java.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NATIVES.</NOTE> The general description is, that their faces are flat, their cheeks broad, their hair short and black, their eye∣brows large, their eyes very small. They boast that they are de∣scended from the <HI>Chinese;</HI> if true, we may account for the pro∣bability of that nation migrating to this island; they may have been from the beginning in the constant habit of frequenting the coasts. The manners of the mountaneers are said to be fierce and barbarous, and their rites idolatrous. The inhabitants of the cities and coasts are <HI>Mahometans.</HI> Representations of the persons of the <HI>Javanese</HI> in different characters are given by Mr. <HI>Nieuhoff,</HI> in his travels

<P><HI>Le Brun</HI>
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. tab. 197.</NOTE> represents a very curious figure of one of the savage natives of the southern coast: he seemed a fine made man, almost black; his head covered with thick frizzled hair, lips large, nose depressed, body naked, except a cloth round his waste; on the right arm and left leg an ivory ring; his wea∣pons were a strong bow, several lances headed with something sharp, and one with a bearded bone, perhaps that of some ray. The painter, however, has certainly got hold of a native of the <HI>Papua</HI> islands, and not of the south of <HI>Java.</HI></P>
<P>IN enumerating the quadrupeds of this island,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">QUADRUPEDS.</NOTE> I shall omit all

<P>THESE beautiful lines,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOHON UPAS.</NOTE> from a singular and delightful poem, is my introduction to the account of the most violent of poisons, extracted from the celebrated <HI>Bohon Upas,</HI> of <HI>Java;</HI> the <HI>Arbor Toxicaria,</HI> or <HI>Ipo</HI> of <HI>Rumphius,</HI> vol. ii. p. 263. tab. 86.; and the <HI>Epu</HI> of <HI>Kaempf. Amoen. Exot.</HI> p. 575. I shall extract from the first what he has said respecting this dreadful tree,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A DREADFUL POISON.</NOTE> in order to establish the truth of what has been reported of its dire effects, and illustrate the relation with certain melancholy proofs; after which will be given the more than apocryphal tales of the manner of procuring that infernal juice.</P>
<P>THE tree,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">STRANGE ACCOUNT OF.</NOTE> so long famed in many of the <HI>East India</HI> islands for the wonderful, and almost incredible effects of its poisonous juice, has hitherto eluded the prying eye of the naturalist; and, con∣sequently, its class in the botanical system has never yet been ascertained, notwithstanding the indefatigable researches of <HI>Eu∣ropeans</HI> to obtain full information upon so interesting a subject; all we know for certain of the tree itself is, the figure of its leaf, and fruit, which the learned and accurate <HI>Rumphius</HI> has exhi∣bited in the <HI>Herbarium Amboinense.</HI> After much entreaty, and persevering application to the <HI>Dutch</HI> governors of <HI>Celebes</HI> (the most noted of all the islands of the <HI>East Indies</HI> for the production of this tree), <HI>Rumphius</HI> was favored by <HI>De Cops,</HI> governor of <HI>Ma∣cassar,</HI> with a branch of it, and a specimen of its poisonous juice. An ensign of the army was deputed in form to be the messenger of so rare a present. Of such a penetrating and malignant na∣ture
<PB N="43" REF="51"/>was this found to be, that the very touching with the hand the <HI>Bamboo</HI> in which it was inclosed, occasioned a tingling and numbness like that felt in a limb that had been exposed to in∣tense cold, and suddenly brought to the fire.</P>
<P>NATURE has wisely ordained that this baneful tree should be extremely rare, and its situation the most sequestered from the busy haunts of men, amidst mountains of difficult access, and inhabited by the most barbarous tribes; they alone are ac∣quainted with the effects that this subtile poison has upon the circumambient air, and such animals as approach its tremendous shade. The atmosphere is here said to be so infected by the de∣leterious quality of the effluvia of this pestilential tree, that birds which accidentally perch upon its boughs are seized with torpor, and drop down dead. No man dares approach it without his hands, feet, and head being well shrouded with linen cloths; were this precaution neglected, he would become benumbed, and presently lose the use of his limbs. The dripping of rain water from the tree upon the body, causes it to swell; and should it fall upon the bare head, the loss of all the hair would ensue. No other tree can exist in its vicinity, and the earth be∣neath it is parched and withered; so that Death seems emi∣nently to have fixed his station here.</P>
<P>IT is no wonder that the love of the marvellous, natural to mankind, has added somewhat to the truly astonishing scenes that the environs of this tree exhibit. Hence the rude nations of this mountanous tract have made it the habitation of a ser∣pent, whose eyes glare like fire in the night, and remind us of
<PB N="44" REF="52"/>the fabled gardens of the <HI>Hesperides</HI> in classic lore, whose sta∣tionary centinel was a watchful dragon.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Dutch</HI> call this tree <HI>Macasserne Gift-boom,</HI> or <HI>Spatten∣boom;</HI> and in the <HI>Malaye</HI> language it is termed <HI>Caju-Upas,</HI> that is to say poison-tree, and the fruit simply <HI>Upas.</HI> By the people of <HI>Macassar,</HI> and throughout <HI>Celebes,</HI> both the tree and its poison are called <HI>Ipo.</HI></P>
<P>THE darts to which the natives apply this poison, are a foot or eighteen inches in length, very slender, made of reed, or light wood, and armed with the tooth of the <HI>Lamia</HI> shark smeared with poison. These are fixed in a tube five or six feet long, and blown by the breath of the assailant with great force to the distance of pistol shot: upon reaching the destined ob∣ject, the barbed tooth adheres, and the wood only can be ex∣tracted, or sometimes detaches itself, and falls to the ground. The effect of the poison is to produce a sensation of heat in all parts of the body, and oppressive Vertigo in the head, which is presently succeeded by a total debility, and death within the space of half an hour is the certain consequence. Nay so rapid are its effects in some instances, as to prove fatal in less than a quarter of an hour. And farther, so instantaneously does its virus pervade the whole human frame, that by experiments made upon malefactors, it has been proved, that if the thumb or the foot only be wounded by the poisonous dart, and am∣putation immediately performed upon the affected member, astonishing to relate! death infallibly ensues.</P>
<P>AFTER a long intercourse, and many bloody contests with the
<PB N="45" REF="53"/>natives of <HI>Celebes,</HI> which may be stiled the <HI>Colchos</HI> of <HI>India,</HI> being an island noted for many other sorts of poison, the <HI>Dutch</HI> acquired the knowlege of some specifics among the in∣digenous plants, which disarmed this tremendous weapon of much of its terrors. Here are said to be two species of the <HI>Ipo,</HI> distinguished by the names of male and female, and that the poison of the latter is much less efficacious than that of the for∣mer, and used chiefly for the destruction of game. The juice is extracted from the tree by piercing the bark of the trunk, and inserting therein long bamboos sharpened at the point. Four or five of these are fixed to one tree, and remain three or four days, that the sap may leisurely distil into them, and when filled they are removed for use.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>N. P. Foersch,</HI> a <HI>Dutch</HI> surgeon stationed at <HI>Batavia</HI> in 1774, gives the following account of the situation of the tree, and the manner of collecting the poison. The reader is left to form a judgment of the writer's authority, and how far his cre∣dulity is to be censured. "It is," says he,
<Q>seated about twenty∣seven leagues from <HI>Soura,</HI> the seat of the emperor, encircled by high hills and mountains, and the country around, to the distance of ten or twelve miles, has neither tree nor shrub, or even the least plant or grass. I have made the tour all around this dangerous spot, at about eighteen miles distant from the centre, and I found the aspect of the country on all sides equally dreary. The easiest ascent of the hills is from that part where the old ecclesiastic dwells. I had procured a re∣commendation from an old <HI>Malayan</HI> priest, to another priest who lives on the nearest inhabitable spot to the tree, which is
<PB N="46" REF="54"/>about fifteen or sixteen miles distant. The letter proved of great service to me in my undertaking, as that priest is ap∣pointed by the emperor to reside there, to prepare for eternity the souls of those who for different crimes are sentenced to approach the tree, and to procure the poison. From his house the criminals are sent for the poison, into which the points of all warlike instruments are dipped. It is of high value, and produces a considerable revenue to the emperor.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE poison which is procured from this tree, is a gum that issues out between the bark and the tree itself, like the cam∣phor. Malefactors, who for their crimes are sentenced to die, are the only persons who fetch the poison; and this is the only chance they have of saving their lives. After sentence is pronounced upon them by the judge, they are asked in court, whether they will die by the hands of the executioner, or whether they will go to the <HI>Upas</HI> tree for a box of poison. They commonly prefer the latter proposal, as there is not only some chance of preserving their lives, but also a certainty, in case of their safe return, that a provision will be made for them in future by the emperor. They are also permitted to ask a favor from the emperor, which is generally of a trifling nature, and commonly granted. They are then provided with a silver or tortoiseshell box, in which they are to put the poisonous gum, and are properly instructed how to pro∣ceed while they are upon their dangerous expedition. Among other particulars, they are always told to attend to the direc∣tion of the winds; as they are to go towards the tree before the wind, so that the effluvia from the tree are always blown
<PB N="47" REF="55"/>from them. They are told likewise to travel with the utmost dispatch, as that is the only method of insuring a safe return. They are afterwards sent to the house of the old priest, to which place they are commonly attended by their friends and relations. Here they generally remain some days, in expec∣tation of a favorable breeze. During that time, the eccle∣siastic prepares them for their future fate by prayers and ad∣monitions.</Q></P>
<P><Q>WHEN the hour of their departure arrives, the priest puts them on a long leather cap, with two glasses before their eyes, which comes down as far as their breast; and also pro∣vides them with a pair of leather gloves. They are then conducted by the priest, and their friends and relations, about two miles on their journey. Here the priest repeats his in∣structions, and tells them where they are to look for the tree. He shews them a hill, which they are told to ascend, and that on the other side they will find a rivulet, which they are to follow, and which will conduct them directly to the <HI>Upas.</HI> They now take leave of each other; and, amidst prayers for their success, the delinquents hasten away.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE worthy old ecclesiastic has assured me that during his residence there for upwards of thirty years, he had dismissed above seven hundred criminals in the manner which I have described; and that scarcely two out of twenty have returned. He shewed me a catalogue of all the unhappy sufferers, with the date of their departure from his house annexed, and a list of the offences for which they had been condemned; to which was added, a list of those who had returned in safety. I after∣wards
<PB N="48" REF="56"/>saw another list of these culprits, at the jail-keeper's at <HI>Soura Charta,</HI> and found that they perfectly corresponded with each other, and with the different informations which I afterwards obtained.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I WAS present at some of these melancholy ceremonies, and desired different delinquents to bring with them some pieces of the wood, or a small branch, or some leaves of this wonderful tree. I have also given them silk cords, desiring them to measure its thickness. I never could procure more than two dry leaves that were picked up by one of them on his return; and all I could learn from him concerning the tree itself, was that it stood on the border of a rivulet, as de∣scribed by the old priest; that it was of a middling size; that five or six young trees of the same kind stood close by it; but that no other shrub or plant could be seen near it; and that the ground was of a brownish sand, full of stones, almost im∣practicable for travelling, and covered with dead bodies. After many conversations with the old <HI>Malayan</HI> priest, I ques∣tioned him about the first discovery, and asked his opinion of this dangerous tree; upon which he gave me the following answer:</Q></P>
<P><Q>WE are told in our new Alcoran, that above an hundred years ago, the country around the tree was inhabited by a people strongly addicted to the sins of <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrha;</HI> when the great prophet <HI>Mahomet</HI> determined not to suffer them to lead such detestable lives any longer, he applied to <HI>God</HI> to punish them; upon which <HI>God</HI> caused this tree to grow
<PB N="49" REF="57"/>out of the earth, which destroyed them all, and rendered the country for ever uninhabitable.</Q></P>
<P><Q>SUCH was the <HI>Malayan</HI> opinion. I shall not attempt a com∣ment; but must observe that all the <HI>Malayans</HI> considered this tree as an holy instrument of the great prophet to punish the sins of mankind; and therefore to die of the poison of the <HI>Upas</HI> is generally considered among them as an honorable death. For that reason I also observed, that the delinquents who were going to the tree, were generally dressed in their best ap∣parel.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THIS however is certain, though it may appear incredible, that from fifteen to eighteen miles round this tree, not only no human creature can exist, but that, in that space of ground, no living animal of any kind has ever been discovered. I have also been assured by several persons of veracity that there are no fish in the waters, nor has any rat, mouse, or any other vermin been seen there; and when any birds fly so near this tree that the effluvia reaches them, they fall a sacrifice to the effects of the poison. This circumstance has been ascertained by different delinquents, who, in their return, have seen the birds drop down, and have picked them up dead, and brought them to the old ecclesiastic.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Foersch</HI> gives us an account of the fatal effects in the fol∣lowing melancholy narration.
<Q>In the year 1776, in the month of <HI>February,</HI> I was present at the execution of thirteen of the emperors concubines, at <HI>Soura Charta,</HI> who were convicted of infidelity to the emperor's bed. It was in the forenoon, about eleven o'clock, when the fair criminals were led into an open space within the walls of the emperor's palace. There the
<PB N="50" REF="58"/>judge passed sentence upon them, by which they are doomed to suffer death by a lancet poisoned with <HI>Upas.</HI> After this the Alcoran was presented to them, and they were, according to the law of their great prophet <HI>Mahomet,</HI> to acknowlege, and to affirm by oath, that the charges brought against them, together with the sentence and their punishment, were fair and equitable. This they did by laying their right hand upon the Alcoran, their left hands upon their breasts, and their eyes lifted towards heaven; the judge then held the Alcoran to their lips, and they kissed it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THESE ceremonies over, the executioner proceeded on his business in the following manner:—Thirteen posts, each about five feet high, had been previously erected, to these the de∣linquents were fastened, and their breasts stripped naked. In this situation they remained a short time in continual prayers, attended by several priests, until a signal was given by the judge to the executioner, on which the latter produced an in∣strument, much like the spring lancet used by farriers for bleeding horses. With this instrument, it being poisoned with the gum of the <HI>Upas,</HI> the unhappy wretches were lanced in the middle of their breasts, and the operation was performed upon them all in less than two minutes.</Q></P>
<P><Q>MY astonishment was raised to the highest degree, when I beheld the sudden effects of that poison, for in about five mi∣nutes after they were lanced, they were taken with a tremor, attended with a <HI>subsultus tendinum,</HI> after which they died in the greatest agonies, crying out to GOD and <HI>Mahomet</HI> for mercy. In sixteen minutes by my watch, which I held in my hand, all the criminals were no more; some hours after
<PB N="51" REF="59"/>their death, I observed their bodies full of livid spots, much like those of the <HI>Petechioe,</HI> their faces swelled, their color changed to a kind of blue, their eyes looked yellow, &amp;c. &amp;c
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Though the recent information obtained in the course of Lord <HI>Macartneys</HI> embassy to <HI>China,</HI> vol. i. p. 272, totally invalidates the authority of <HI>Foersch,</HI> yet it appears evident that trees of a most deleterious nature, and productive of the most active poisons, really exist in <HI>Java.</HI> Such also was the opinion of the author of this work, whose depth of judgment placed him far remote from the imputation of credulity; I have therefore ventured, as in other instances, to publish a faithful copy of the original manuscript.

I shall give his words, and also the horrible opinion held at that time, against the <HI>Hebraean</HI> race, whom he accuses of a design of poisoning all Christendom with this infernal juice. After speaking of the trees of beneficent use, he says
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Travels, p. 229.</NOTE>,
<Q>and there ben other trees that beryn venym; azenst the whiche there is no medicyne but on; and that is to taken here propre leves, and stamp hem and tempere hem with watre, and than drynke it; and elle he schalle dye; for triacle will not avaylle, ne non other medicyne.

<P>IN respect to the other trees and plants of <HI>Java,</HI> I can only say that they agree with those of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> and other islands of the great <HI>Archipelago.</HI> Most will be found in my <HI>Flora Indica.</HI> Let me only remark, that the earliest <HI>Dutch</HI> navigators have
<PB N="52" REF="60"/>given tolerable descriptions of several, in the often cited old book published by <HI>Nicholas,</HI> from p. 39 to p. 42, accompanied with plates as expressive as could be cut on wood.</P>
<P>THE vast island of <HI>Borneo</HI> is divided from the northern coast of <HI>Java</HI> by a sound between two and three hundred leagues in breadth.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BORNEO.</NOTE> According to M. <HI>D'Anville</HI>'s scale, the island is in length from south to north near three hundred leagues, and its greatest breadth two hundred; the circumference is estimated at two thousand miles; so that it may justly be considered as the greatest island in the world. It is of a pyriform shape; its shores rude, with projecting promontories, and is divided by the equator into two unequal portions. The far greater part of <HI>Borneo</HI> next to the sea, especially the northern, consists of swamps, co∣vered with forests of trees of numberless species and great sizes, which penetrate for scores of miles towards the centre of the island. These unstable muddy flats are divided by rivers, which branch into multitudes of canals, and are the only roads into the interior parts. Lofty mountains are said to rise in the middle of the island; many are volcanic, and often occasion tremendous earthquakes.</P>
<P>THIS great island is little known, except merely on the coasts, and even those remain yet so imperfectly explored, that less can be said of it than of many smaller tracts. So unstable are the swampy out-skirts, that in the attempts to establish factories, the <HI>Europeans</HI> have been obliged to build them on piles driven into the ground; or, after the manner of the country, to erect in the rivers their houses on posts, fixed to floats formed of bodies of great trees, and those moored by rattans to those growing on shore, to prevent their being carried away by the floods. In
<PB N="53" REF="61"/>such a manner are many of the towns of <HI>Borneo</HI> constructed; they rise and fall with the tide, which here flows but once in the twenty-four hours, and that only in the day. At spring tide, these towns on the <HI>Banjar</HI> river experience the rise and fall of twelve feet.</P>
<P>THE whole coasts are in the hands of <HI>Malayans, Moors,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">INHABITANTS.</NOTE> <HI>Ma∣cassars,</HI> and even <HI>Japanese,</HI> who have perhaps for centuries driven the antient inhabitants into the interior parts. The aborigines are of a black complexion, a middle stature, with long and black hair, and generally better featured than the <HI>Guinea Negroes,</HI> feeble in their bodies, and very indolent and inactive. The women small, handsome, and of a better color than the men. Their general religion is of a mongrel kind of <HI>Mahometanism.</HI> These maintain a feudal government under chieftains, mis∣called by our sailors, kings. The seat of the principal is at <HI>Tatas,</HI> near to <HI>Bandar Masseen,</HI> some miles up the country on the northern side, and seated on a great river, which for many miles is twice as broad as the <HI>Thames</HI> at <HI>Gravesend,</HI> and bounded by trees of most stupendous height. It is navigable far beyond <HI>Bandar Masseen</HI> for the largest ships, and is greatly frequented by the <HI>Chinese</HI> jonks; the river is called <HI>China</HI> for that reason. We are not acquainted with the length of its navi∣gation; but it rises in the very middle of the island, and runs all the way due south. On this river we attempted to form a settle∣ment under the Mr. <HI>Cunningham</HI> we have before mentioned; but by some imprudencies gave offence to the inhabitants, and the greater part of our people were massacred. The same fate has attended other factories of different <HI>European</HI> nations who
<PB N="54" REF="62"/>have endeavored to form settlements at <HI>Succadana, Samba,</HI> and many other places. <HI>Tatas</HI> has its sultan. These sovereigns com∣mand the trade of the island, and furnish the <HI>European</HI> ships, who happen to arrive, with cargoes of pepper, the staple of the country; that article is brought down from the interior parts, and sold to the <HI>Europeans,</HI> or to the commercial <HI>Asiatic</HI> nations.</P>
<P>IT is to Captain <HI>Daniel Beeckman</HI> that we owe the best ac∣count of <HI>Borneo;</HI> he visited it in the beginning of this cen∣tury, and published his account in the year 1718. At p. 36 he gives the following list of the productions of the country,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PRODUCTIONS OF.</NOTE> which abounds with pepper, the best dragon's blood, bezoar, most ex∣cellent camphor, pine apples, citrons, oranges, lemons, water melons, musk melons, plantains, banana, coco nuts, and all sorts of fruit that are generally found in any part of the <HI>East Indies;</HI> the mountains yield diamonds, gold, tin and iron; the forests, honey, cotton, deer, goats, buffaloes, wild oxen, wild hogs, small horses, bears, tigers, elephants, and a multitude of monkies.</P>
<P>THE pepper grows far up the country,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PEPPER.</NOTE> and is collected by the very poorest people only; they have all the different sorts, black, white, and long.</P>
<P><HI>Sanguis Draconis,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SANGUIS DRACONIS.</NOTE> or dragon's blood, is a gum, the exudation of certain trees, of a bloody color. There is a conjecture that this is the <HI>Cinnaberis</HI> of <HI>Dioscorides,</HI> lib. v. c. 69. <HI>Pliny,</HI> lib. xxxiii. c. 7, says that the name is <HI>Indian;</HI> and then fables, that it is the <HI>Sanies</HI> of the dragon oppressed by the weight of an ele∣phant expiring with the bite, and that the <HI>Cinnaberis</HI> is the mixed blood of each animal. The antients procured under this notion the real drug, and used it in medicine. It was often adul∣terated
<PB N="55" REF="63"/>with the blood of goats; the genuine kind was sold at a great rate.</P>
<P>THE trees or shrubs which we know to produce this medi∣cine in our dispensatory are the <HI>Dracaena Draco,</HI> of which <HI>Van∣delli</HI> has given a good figure in his monograph on the subject. According to <HI>Kaempfer, Amoen. Exot.</HI> 554, another of the ve∣getables it is extracted from is a <HI>Palmapinus Rottani Dsierenang,</HI> one of the <HI>Rotangs</HI> described by <HI>Rumphius</HI> under the name of <HI>Palmijuncus Draco,</HI> v. p. 115 tab. 58. fig. 1. This grows in the thick and almost impervious forests of <HI>Java.</HI></P>
<P>ANOTHER kind is the produce of the <HI>Santalum Rubrum,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SANDAL WOOD.</NOTE> or <HI>Red Sanders;</HI> and again, from the <HI>Dracoena Terminalis</HI> of <HI>Lin∣naeus, Rumph.</HI> iv. p. 18. tab. 34, called in <HI>Ternate, Ngassi,</HI> or <HI>Hassi.</HI> This species grows in <HI>Borneo,</HI> and bears a fruit, says <HI>Beeckman,</HI> as red as a cherry; the juice, the best in the world, is extracted from the tree, and the color tried by rubbing it on paper. The natives bring it in drops, wrapped in leaves; but are so apt to adulterate it, that we do not chuse to purchase without previous examination.</P>
<P>ANOTHER kind is procured from the <HI>Gladiolus Odoratus In∣dicus, Rumph.</HI> v. p. 185. tab. 73. For further accounts I must re∣fer to that <HI>Pliny</HI> of the <HI>Indies</HI> in the places cited, to vol. ii. p. 252.; and to <HI>Kaempfer,</HI> 551 to 557. The drug, from whatso∣ever tree or plant it be gotten, maintains its place in our dis∣pensatory.</P>
<P>AT times a considerable quantity of gold has been brought here,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">GOLD.</NOTE> which is found in the mines in the interior parts of the country. Some is melted into bars, and usually adulterated by a
<PB N="56" REF="64"/>cover of base metal. The natives have a very just notion of the lord of the <HI>irritamenta malorum,</HI> for they say, that the devil is sole master of the gold and diamond mines.</P>
<P>DIAMONDS form another article of commerce,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">DIAMONDS.</NOTE> but they are far less valuable than those of <HI>Golconda.</HI></P>
<P>BEES-WAX,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BEES-WAX.</NOTE> in cakes of about thirty-four pounds, is common at <HI>Sambas,</HI> which being the common money of that part of the island, was wont to be bartered with the <HI>Chinese</HI> for various ne∣cessaries. Pearls of considerable beauty are said to be another article of exchange in the same country.</P>
<P>THE bezoar found in the monkies has a most superstitious value,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BEZOAR.</NOTE> and is sold for four or five times its weight in silver.</P>
<P>THE unrefined camphor of <HI>Borneo,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CAMPHOR.</NOTE> is reckoned superior to any in the world. We are not acquainted with the tree which produces that valuable drug.</P>
<P>THE edible (swallows) nests are found in vast abundance;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">EDIBLE NESTS.</NOTE> and the <HI>Bambu</HI> walking canes, form two other articles of trade.</P>
<P>IN the list of quadrupeds is the <HI>Ourang Outang;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">OURANG OUTANG.</NOTE> there ap∣pears to be two species, one that never exceeds two feet and an half in height; see Mr. <HI>Vosmaer</HI>'s account, p. 12, tab xiv. xv. and <HI>Hist. Quad.</HI> i. p. 180. tab. 36. which I have taken the liberty of copying from M. <HI>Vosmaer.</HI> Mr. <HI>Beeckman</HI> speaks of some species growing to the height of six feet; he bought a young one, which was stronger than any man in his ship, but it died before it was a year old. <HI>Borneo</HI> has abundance of these animals. It swarms also with variety of baboons and monkies, so this,
<PB N="57" REF="65"/><HI>Celebes,</HI> and another island, may probably have been the <HI>insulae Satyrorum</HI> of <HI>Ptolemy.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Ourang Outang</HI> is found also in <HI>Java; Hamilton</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Account of the <HI>East Indies,</HI> ii. p. 131.</NOTE> saw one in that island which was four feet high, and mentions a smaller species called <HI>Oumpaes.</HI> He confirms the account of the grave or melancholy habit of the greater species; of its lighting a fire, and blowing it with its mouth; and of its broiling a fish to eat with its boiled rice, imitative of the custom of the human race.</P>
<P>THE aborigines of <HI>Borneo</HI> are called <HI>Byajos;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BYAJOS.</NOTE> they inhabit the interior parts, live under chieftains, and are an independent people, possessing their proper language and religion; the last is called <HI>Paganism,</HI> yet they pay no respect to idols; but offer sa∣crifices of sweet scented wood to one supreme beneficent Deity, who in other worlds rewards the just and punishes the wicked. They marry only one wife, are strictly faithful to their nuptial vows, and have the character of general honesty. Mr. <HI>Beeckman</HI> makes a different report, but fairly confesses that he received it from the <HI>Banjareens,</HI> who will not suffer the <HI>Europeans</HI> to have any intercourse with the natives, and tell many frightful tales of their barbarity. The <HI>Byajos</HI> often come down the river to the port of <HI>Masseen,</HI> in ill shaped praws, with gold dust, diamonds, rattans, bezoar, and other articles of commerce, of which the <HI>Banjareens</HI> are sole factors, and consequently highly interested in keeping the pretended savages from our knowlege.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Byajos</HI> are taller and stronger than the other inhabitants; they go naked, excepting a small wrapper about their loins;
<PB N="58" REF="66"/>they stain their bodies with blue, and by weights affixed to their ears when young, stretch them till they fall on their shoulders. The chieftains pull out their fore teeth, and substitute others of gold, and by way of ornament fling strings of tigers teeth round their necks and bodies. Their arms are lances and poisoned arrows; some of them lead a piratical life in the great rivers, and are most formidable enemies.</P>
<P>LET me here observe that tigers,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TIGERS.</NOTE> those cruel animals, swarm in this island, beyond which they happily cease; nor are they known in any of the islands to the north or to the east of <HI>Borneo.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER navigating along the northern coast of the island, we arrive,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SAMBAAR POINT.</NOTE> in Lat. 2° 28′, on the point of <HI>Sambaar.</HI> Between this and the isle of <HI>Billetou</HI> to the west, is a channel of a hundred and fifty miles in breadth. Near to the west of that island is the small isle of <HI>Salt,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ISLAND OF SALT AND BANCA.</NOTE> and then the isle of <HI>Banca,</HI> all belonging to <HI>Java.</HI></P>
<P>FROM <HI>Sambaar</HI> point the coast turns towards the north. In Lat.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SUCCADANA AND SAMBAS.</NOTE> 0° 15′ south, is <HI>Succadana,</HI> and in Lat. 2° north is <HI>Sambas,</HI> both at times frequented for the sake of commerce. From <HI>Tan∣jong</HI> point the island trends to the north-east. The city of <HI>Borneo</HI> stands in about Lat.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CITY OF BORNEO.</NOTE> 5° 25′ north, on a large river, in the bottom of a bay.</P>
<P>WHEN the famous navigator <HI>Von Noort</HI> was there in 1601, it consisted of three thousand houses, all built on posts and floating planks, in the manner we have described, so that whenever the sultan chose to change his position, he would move with all his city to another part of the river. <HI>Von Noort</HI> found this port
<PB N="59" REF="67"/>much frequented by the <HI>Chinese,</HI> who to this day seem to be the greatest and most constant traders to <HI>Borneo</HI> of all the <HI>Asiatic</HI> nations.</P>
<P>FROM Lat. 6° north, to <HI>Tangio Sampanmangco,</HI> the most nor∣thern promontory of <HI>Borneo,</HI> in Lat. 7°, the coast changes its na∣ture, being skirted all the way with a lofty chain of mountains; and within are appearances of others of very uncertain extent; that northern headland has another correspondent, called <HI>Inoran∣tang,</HI> facing likewise the north; between both is the deep bay of <HI>Malbordoo,</HI> penetrating far to the south; opposite to the last headland is the small island of <HI>Banguey,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ISLAND OF BANGUEY.</NOTE> lofty and mountanous, as if rent from it by some violent convulsions.</P>
<P>A LITTLE to the west of that island, in Lat. 7° 20′,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ISLAND OF BA∣LAMBANGAM.</NOTE> is the isle <HI>Balambangan,</HI> composed of sand and swamps, and famous for the intention of the <HI>East India</HI> company, in 1773, to form on it a vast <HI>emporium</HI> of the commodities of <HI>China,</HI> and of all this great eastern archipelago. We got the cession of this little spot (then uninhabited) from the king of <HI>Soolo;</HI> we took possession of it at a vast expence, according to <HI>Raynal</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. vol. ii. p. 132.</NOTE> it cost us £.375,000. A com∣pany of <HI>European</HI> troops, and a number of <HI>Seapoys,</HI> were detained for the protection of the settlement; and a colony of <HI>Malayes</HI> from <HI>Bencoolen,</HI> and another of <HI>Chinese,</HI> were induced to establish them∣selves there. We could not have fixed on a more unwholesome situation; the diseases of the climate attacked both the military and the colonists, and very few survived the sickly season, so that scarcely one in ten outlived the monsoon: the <HI>Abbe Raynal</HI> asserts that we were attacked, and the factory destroyed, and insinuates it
<PB N="60" REF="68"/>to have been done by the instigation of the <HI>Dutch</HI> or <HI>Spaniards,</HI> jealous of their commercial interests in that neighborhood.</P>
<P>AT a small distance to the north,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MANILLA I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>AN<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>S.</NOTE> about Lat. 7°, begins the vast group of the <HI>Philippine</HI> islands; these are much more pro∣bably the <HI>Maniolae</HI> of <HI>Ptolemy,</HI> than the lesser <HI>Andaman,</HI> which <HI>D'Anville</HI> supposes it to have been. These islands were known to the antients by the <HI>Indian</HI> name, which is still retained in <HI>Manilla; Ptolemy</HI> speaks of them as ten islands immediately be∣yond the <HI>tres insulae Satyrorum,</HI> or <HI>Borneo,</HI> &amp;c. They were first discovered by the great <HI>Magellan,</HI> who came in sight of them on <HI>April</HI> 17th 1521, and named them the <HI>Archipelago</HI> of <HI>St. Lazarus.</HI> He landed on one of them called <HI>Mactan,</HI> near to <HI>Zebu,</HI> where, ac∣ording to <HI>Pigafetta,</HI> a companion and eye witness, he, with eight or nine of his men, was slain in an encounter with the natives.</P>
<P>THE discovery of these islands was completed in 1541,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">WHEN DISCOVERED.</NOTE> by a <HI>Spaniard</HI> of the name of <HI>Ruy Lopez de Villalobos,</HI> who named them the <HI>Philippine,</HI> in honor of <HI>Philip</HI> prince of <HI>Spain,</HI> after∣wards <HI>Philip</HI> II. We chuse to retain the antient name the <HI>Ma∣nillas.</HI></P>
<P>THE first settlement made by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in these islands was not till the year 1565, when <HI>Michael Lopez de Lagaspi</HI> built a town in the isle of <HI>Zebu.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ZEBU.</NOTE> He secured it by a small garrison, and then proceeded to the conquest of other islands more worthy of his arms. He sailed into a fine bay in the island of <HI>Manilla</HI> or <HI>Luconia,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ISLAND OF LUCONIA.</NOTE> and was, in 1571, the founder of the city of <HI>Manilla,</HI> so celebrated for its opulence, and for being the common reposi∣tory and place of exchange of the productions of both the <HI>Indies;</HI>
<PB N="61" REF="69"/>one may also say, those of the old and the new world; of <HI>Europe,</HI> of <HI>India,</HI> and of <HI>China;</HI> and in return it receives the silver of <HI>Potosi.</HI> The indolence of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> will not suffer these islands to produce any one article of commerce,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">GOLD.</NOTE> a little gold ex∣cepted, brought down the sloods into the channels of the ri∣vers. The group certainly contains rich mines of the pretious metal, but as wealth flows in such abundance with very little trouble to the colonists, they will not be at the pains of exploring the veins. <HI>Luconia</HI> also produces abundance of excellent iron and copper.</P>
<P>THE fruitfulness of soil is a perpetual reproach to the sloth∣fulness of its lords. A very few exceptions are to be found; one friend to the island introduced the <HI>Coco tree, Theobroma cacao, Catesby,</HI> Suppl. tab. 6, which is cultivated with such success, as to become almost the support of the inhabitants, by giving them the favorite food of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> chocolate; indigo,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">INDICO.</NOTE> which grows spontaneously, owes of late years its use in their manu∣factories to the sagacity of an individual. It was not till the year 1744, that the sluggish <HI>Spaniards</HI> ever knew the culture of <HI>European</HI> grains or esculents. As to the native productions, it possesses every tree or fruit common to the torrid zone, and num∣bers probably peculiar to itself, few only of which are brought to view, and that by the industry of a <HI>Sonnerat.</HI></P>
<P>THE unwise expulsion of the Jesuits will long retard, pos∣sibly for ever prevent, the improvement of the <HI>Manilla</HI> islands. The domains of that intelligent order were covered with cattle innumerable; their meadows stretched numbers of miles, wa∣tered and fertilized by the rivers of the country.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="70"/><HI>Manilla,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CITY OF MANILLA.</NOTE> by being the mere repository of the goods of other nations, grew into a most flourishing city; the streets regular, the churches and publick buildings superb. A splendid luxury pervades every part, in the appearance of dress, and equipage, and inside of the houses of the proud and lazy colonists.</P>
<P>THE port of <HI>Manilla</HI> is at <HI>Cavite,</HI> three leagues distant, and is subject to many inconveniences; being greatly infested with the worm, the <HI>teredo navalis,</HI> which in a little time would render the galleons, and the vessels which trade to <HI>Manilla,</HI> incapable of keeping the sea; neither is it secure from the north and north∣west winds; besides, ships lying there are obliged to send far for water, and to employ for that purpose the flat boats of the country.</P>
<P>THE city of <HI>Manilla</HI> is fortified, well built, and the streets very regular, but the third part is occupied by convents; the num∣ber of christians is computed at about twelve thousand. <HI>Gomez Peres de las Marignas</HI> surrounded it with walls in 1590.</P>
<P>IT is from hence the great commerce between <HI>Manilla</HI> and <HI>Acapulco,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ACAPULCO SHITS.</NOTE> on the coast of <HI>Mexico,</HI> is carried on, in one and some∣times in two ships, sent annually, fitted out at the expence of the king, but freighted by the merchants. They are of an enormous size, heavy and unwieldy, as big as a first rate man of war, and having a complement of twelve hundred men; the lesser is above twelve hundred tons burden, has from three hundred and fifty to six hundred hands, passengers included, and carries fifty guns, but often mounts only thirty-six. It leaves <HI>Manilla</HI> the middle of <HI>July,</HI> but does not reach <HI>Acapulco</HI> till the middle of <HI>January.</HI> One miracle of this voyage is, that notwithstanding they put on
<PB N="63" REF="71"/>board all the water they can stow, consistent with the full cargo, they depend for a supply from the heavens, between Lat. 30° and 40°, and hazard the most dreadful of deaths, should their ex∣pectations be disappointed; when they arrive in these latitudes, they prepare their mats, which they spread to direct the deluge of rain into various vessels, and, wonderful to say, there is not an instance in which their hopes have failed.</P>
<P><HI>Manilla</HI> is the great magazine of all the goods of <HI>India, China,</HI> and <HI>Europe,</HI> which are laid up here annually to be con∣veyed across the <HI>Pacific</HI> ocean, to supply the wants or luxuries of the new world. "There are," as the editor of lord <HI>Anson</HI>'s voyage informs us, at p. 237,
<Q>spices, all sorts of <HI>Chinese</HI> silks and ma∣nufactures, particularly silk stockings, of which I have heard that no less than fifty thousand pair were the usual number shipped on board the annual ship; vast quantities of <HI>Indian</HI> stuffs, as callicoes and chintz, which are much worn in <HI>Ame∣rica,</HI> together with minuter articles, as goldsmiths work, &amp;c. which is principally done at the city of <HI>Manilla</HI> itself by the <HI>Chinese;</HI> for it is said there are at least twenty thousand <HI>Chinese</HI> who constantly reside there, either as servants, manu∣facturers, or brokers; all these different commodities are col∣lected at <HI>Manilla,</HI> thence to be transported annually, in one or more ships, to the port of <HI>Acapuico</HI> in the kingdom of <HI>Mexico.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THE return from the new world is only in silver, either in specie or virgin metal; the author of Lord <HI>Anson</HI>'s voyage, con∣fesses to only 1,313,843 pieces of eight, and 35,682 ounces of virgin silver, or £.400,000 of our money, having been sound in
<PB N="64" REF="72"/>the <HI>Manilla</HI> ship, out of which the family have realized their vast-estate. Even when the ship arrives safe, the treasure is of little advantage to the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> it is instantly dispersed over half the world, to pay for the merchandize of its outward voyage.</P>
<P>THE city of <HI>Manilla</HI> was besieged and taken by the <HI>English</HI> in 1762.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MANILLA <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> 1762.</NOTE> Our little squadron, under vice admiral <HI>Cornish,</HI> appeared before it on <HI>September</HI> 23d, our land forces were under colonel <HI>Draper;</HI> after a short resistance the city was taken by storm, with as little slaughter as the nature of circumstances would admit. The island of <HI>Luconia,</HI> and every island dependent on it, surren∣dered to our arms; a large sum was accepted to save the place from plunder, hostages given for the payment, and bills drawn by the archbishop or viceroy, which in part were never ac∣cepted, and our soldiers and seamen deprived of the reward due to their valor.</P>
<P>THIS archipelago consists of about twelve or thirteen greater islands, with small ones innumerable, divided from each other by narrow channels of very difficult navigation, all of them moun∣tanous, and many of them volcanic. <HI>Manilla,</HI> the largest and most northern, is a hundred and fifteen <HI>French</HI> leagues in length, not reckoning the peninsula of <HI>Camarines,</HI> which juts irregularly from the main body, and extends far to the south; <HI>Raynal</HI> re∣presents all the islands as terribly majestic. They are covered with <HI>basaltes,</HI> with <HI>lava,</HI> with <HI>scoriae,</HI> with black glass, with melted iron, with grey and friable stones filled with the wrecks of the animal and vegetable kingdoms, with sulphur kept in a state of fusion by the continual action of subterraneous fires, and
<PB N="65" REF="73"/>with burning waters which communicate with hidden flames. All these great accidents of nature, are the effect of extinguished volcanoes, of some that are still burning, and of others that are forming in these deep cavities, where combustible materials are perpetually in agitation.</P>
<P>EARTHQUAKES are frequent and sometimes tremendous.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">EARTHQUAKES.</NOTE> Mr. <HI>Pye,</HI> in the Philosophical Transactions
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. xlix. p. 458.</NOTE>, gives an account of one of uncommon horror in 1750, which lasted for three months, with almost continual tremblings, and at last broke out in an eruption, from a small island, in the middle of a lake, round which the bottom is unfathomable. The third day after the com∣mencement of the eruption, there arose four more small islands all burning; and about a mile distance from one there is a conti∣nual fire which issues from the water, where there is no ground for upwards of an hundred fathoms deep.</P>
<P>IT is generally supposed that before the arrival of the <HI>Euro∣peans,</HI> the <HI>Chinese</HI> had possessed themselves of the sea coasts of these islands. The <HI>Japanese</HI> also boast of having been once lords of the <HI>Philippines,</HI> and the vicinity to both those empires may make it probable.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Chinese</HI> were so numerous in <HI>Manilla</HI> about the year 1600,

The <HI>Spaniards,</HI> assisted by the <HI>Japanese</HI> and other foreigners, took the usual method of preventing them, by putting no less than twenty-five thousand to the sword; the massacre of these people was far greater than that of <HI>Batavia.</HI> The <HI>Spaniards</HI>
<PB N="66" REF="74"/>assert that the <HI>Chinese</HI> had actually begun to revolt, and had mur∣dered several of the <HI>Europeans.</HI> The <HI>Chinese</HI> charge the horrible transaction on the <HI>Europeans,</HI> and say it was excited by their ava∣rice, in order to make themselves masters of the rich effects of their countrymen. The emperor sent an embassador to demand satisfaction, and spoke in high terms of the revenge he would take; all ended by a pacification; the <HI>Chinese</HI> fleets resorted to <HI>Manilla</HI> in as great a number as ever, and the suburbs were soon re-peopled with inhabitants. The wealth that we are told the <HI>Chinese</HI> brought into the islands was unspeakable. The Jesuits were expelled the country in 1768, and in the year following, by the bigotry of the governor, every one of the <HI>Chinese</HI> were ba∣nished from the <HI>Philippine</HI> islands, since which trade and the arts have declined, and depopulation and distress promise to be the consequences of so imprudent a measure.</P>
<P>IN the mountanous parts of the islands are remnants of the original inhabitants,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NATIVES.</NOTE> a most singular race of men, who through an excessive love of liberty, have relapsed into a state of na∣ture. Those who inhabit the foot of a mountain are mortal enemies to those that reside at the top, and both are equally hated by those who live in the middle; happy picture of enthusiastic independency! They are seen wandering singly amidst the woods, armed with bows and arrows; naked, excepting the skin of a goat flung over their shoulders; they lodge in hollow trees, or hollows of the rocks; have no notion of society, and, like the primaeval inhabitants of the world,
<Q>Venerem incertam rapientes, more serarum.</Q></P>
<P>THESE men are strongly made,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CURLED HEADED INDIANS.</NOTE> of haggard countenances, black,
<PB N="67" REF="75"/>with curled hair like the negroes, and called by the <HI>Spaniards, Negrillos.</HI> They certainly are of the same race as the <HI>Papuans</HI> or people of <HI>New Guinea,</HI> who might originally have spread themselves over this tract. These curled headed tribes are found in most of the other islands. <HI>Navarette</HI> mentions other black <HI>Indians;</HI> the men paint themselves with white, the women with other colors. These, and other <HI>Indian</HI> people, often descend on the <HI>Spanish</HI> settlements, and commit horrible murders. Some of them, like the antient <HI>Scythians,</HI> make drinking cups of the sculls of their enemies.</P>
<P>THERE are other <HI>Indians</HI> that profess a sort of dependency on the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and have an <HI>Alcayde</HI> among them; yet their manners are barbarous; they are brave, but ferocious; and ap∣pear to have been descended from the <HI>Malayans,</HI> settled here in very early times. They are called <HI>Tagalese,</HI> and the <HI>Negrillos</HI> pretend, that they had been originally their slaves. Their arms are bows and arrows; they took part with the <HI>Spaniards</HI> during the siege of the capital; and ignorant of the laws of nations, slew in the most savage manner our admiral's secretary, carrying a flag of truce, and even the nephew of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Governor, who attempted to rescue him from their fury. The strength of their arms was satally experienced by that gallant officer major <HI>More,</HI> who fell transfixed by an arrow in leading our troops to the storm.</P>
<P>I SHALL now mention a few particulars respecting the natu∣ral history of the <HI>Manillas.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NATURAL HISTORY.</NOTE> It is not to be wondered that in one so abundant in volcanoes, there should be found springs of hot water. The most noted is that which appears two leagues from
<PB N="68" REF="76"/><HI>Calamba;</HI> the stream which runs from it is of a boiling heat; and raised the liquor in M. <HI>de Reaumur</HI>'s thermometer to the height of 69 degrees, even at the distance of a league from the source. M. <HI>Sonnerat</HI> observed five shrubs, the roots of which were drenched by the stream, and the top enveloped in the va∣por, yet grew with vigor. At the same time the swallows which happened to skim the brook, at the height of seven or eight feet from the surface, fell down motionless.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Bashee</HI> islands lie midway between <HI>Manilla</HI> and <HI>For∣mosa;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BASHEE ISLANDS.</NOTE> the middlemost of them is, according to Lord <HI>Anson,</HI> in Lat. 2° 4′ north. I speak of them here notwithstanding they belong to neither one or the other. <HI>Dampier,</HI> in the year 1687, being engaged in these seas in a buccaneering expedition, wished for a temporary concealment. He had seen in certain charts, the figure V. which denoted their number
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dampier's voyage, i. 420.</NOTE>. He sailed to the spot, and found them to correspond in position and number. None of them had names, so he bestowed on them those of <HI>Orange, Grafton, Monmouth, Goat,</HI> and <HI>Bashee,</HI> the last from a sort of beer made of the boiled juice of the sugar cane, and some small black berries, which was put into jars to settle, and was thought by our seamen an excellent liquor, capable of giving the pleasure of ebriety, without the bad effects. The natives sold it to them in plenty, for which reason they made it the general name of the islands.</P>
<P><HI>Monmouth</HI> and <HI>Grafton</HI> isles are very lofty,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SINGULAR VILLAGES.</NOTE> with a nume∣rous succession of precipices one above another. On these the natives build their villages, which affords the singular prospect
<PB N="69" REF="77"/>of three or four rows of small houses, erected on posts, and wattled with boughs. They have no other way of getting to their habitations but by a ladder, which is pulled up after them, if they mean to ascend to the upper villages, or to secure them∣selves from an assault. These two islands are the most populous, as they have more of these precipices. <HI>Bashee</HI> island has but one precipice, and in consequence only one town. <HI>Orange</HI> is lofty, yet so plain as to furnish no spot sitted for the site of their villages, and is therefore uninhabited.</P>
<P>THE produce of these islands are a few of the tropical fruits,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PRODUCE.</NOTE> pine apples, sugar canes, plantains, bananas, calabashes, yams, and potatoes. These are planted in the vallies, which are well watered with small streams; they are also well wooded, but the trees do not grow to any large size. Their animals are hogs and goats in plenty; their poultry sew; among the wild fowl, par∣roquets and some other small birds.</P>
<P>THE natives are short and squat, round visaged,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NATIVES.</NOTE> with low foreheads and thick eye-brows; short low noses, eyes small and hazel, but larger than those of the <HI>Chinese;</HI> lips and mouth of a middle size, hair black, thick, lank, and cut short, so as just to cover the ears. The description of these people agrees so exactly with that of the <HI>Japanese</HI> given by <HI>Kaempfer</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. of Japan, i. p. 95.</NOTE>, that there cannot be any doubt of their origin.</P>
<P>THEIR government is quite patriarchal;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">GOVERNMENT.</NOTE> their religion has no exterior rites, but probably is mental, as is common with many orientalists. There is no appearance of idols on any of their islands: They certainly have laws; for <HI>Dampier</HI> saw the crime of thest punished in a young man who was buried alive in the
<PB N="70" REF="78"/>presence of a great multitude assembled on the occasion. Their manners were innoffensive, friendly, and honest, not only among themselves, but to the new visitants, who possibly were the first <HI>Europeans</HI> they had seen.</P>
<P>IN general the men went naked, excepting the usual wrapper about their loins; some had jackets of plantain leaves; the rudest, says <HI>Dampier,</HI> of all clothing. The women had a strong thick short petticoat of cotton, made of the lesser cotton plant, the pro∣duct of their own isles. Both sexes wore large ear-rings of a yellow metal, which was found in their mountains; it was heavy, and,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">GOLD.</NOTE> like the paler gold, it faded with time, but the natives re∣stored it to its original brightness, by smearing it over with a red earth, and flinging it into a fire till it was red hot. Our na∣vigator had no means of proving whether it was gold.</P>
<P>To the women was left the care of the plantations.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOATS.</NOTE> The men were engaged in fishing; they built with much skill their small boats, which resembled the <HI>Deal</HI> yawls, formed of very narrow planks, fastened with pins and nails. They had also larger boats, which carried forty or fifty men, and were rowed by twelve or fourteen oars on a si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e. It seems as if they went to the island of <HI>Manilla</HI> for their iron; which they manufactured at home.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ARMS.</NOTE> From thence they get their other only import, pieces of buffaloes hides, with which they make their defensive armor, or buff coats: their sole offensive weapons are lances headed with iron; all this implies the fear of enemies, and makes it pro∣bable that they are subject to the attacks of the piratical <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER this digression,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MANILLAS AGAIN.</NOTE> let me return to the great group of the <HI>Manillas.</HI> The island of <HI>Mindora</HI> lies south of that of <HI>Manilla;</HI> and
<PB N="71" REF="79"/>is very lofty and mountanous; many of the natives pay tribute to the <HI>Spaniards. Sonnerat</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage aux Indes, ii. 114.</NOTE> says, that most voyagers assert, that there is a race of men in this island which have tails: the same is feigned of certain people in <HI>Borneo,</HI> but the fact turns out that they happen to have the <HI>Os Coccygis</HI> a little more elon∣gated than is usual in the human species.</P>
<P>SOUTH of <HI>Mindora</HI> is the cluster of small isles called the <HI>Ca∣lamianes,</HI> with others still smaller to the east of them.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CALAMIANES.</NOTE> The island of <HI>Paragua</HI> stretches from the <HI>Calamianes</HI> near seventy leagues in length; and at the southern end approaches the isles of <HI>Ba∣lambangan</HI> off the coast of <HI>Borneo.</HI> The <HI>Spaniards</HI> have here some tributary <HI>Indians;</HI> part of the island is said to be subject to a sultan in <HI>Borneo.</HI></P>
<P>ALL these islands form the western boundary of a great gulph:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">GREAT CENTRAL BAY IN THE MIDST OF THE MANILLAS.</NOTE> The rest of the <HI>Manillas,</HI> and the <HI>Soolo Archipelago,</HI> are on the north and east sides; the end of <HI>Borneo</HI> is on the south. A few small isles are scattered over the middle. To go on with the far∣ther account of the island; <HI>Manduque, Masbate,</HI> and numbers of small isles, fill the part next to <HI>Luconia</HI> or <HI>Manilla. Samal,</HI> a large island, faces the ocean on their outside to the east. Its pro∣montory, <HI>El Spirito santo,</HI> is remarkable by the capture of the rich <HI>Manilla</HI> ship by lord <HI>Anson,</HI> it being the first of the islands which those vessels make in their course from <HI>Acapulco</HI> to their port of <HI>Manilla.</HI></P>
<P>PANAY-BUGLAS, or isle of <HI>Negros, Zebu</HI> and <HI>Leyte,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PANAY.</NOTE> with the lesser isle of <HI>Bohol,</HI> range nearly east and west, parallel to each other, a little to the south of the preceding. The principal settle∣ments
<PB N="72" REF="80"/>of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are <HI>Ho-Ho</HI> and <HI>Antigue,</HI> in the island of <HI>Panay;</HI> but off <HI>Antigue</HI> is the sole anchorage, and that only in the months of <HI>November, December,</HI> and <HI>January.</HI> The inha∣bitants of this island are infinitely more industrious than those of <HI>Luconia;</HI> they have a manufactory of handkerchiefs, and a sort of linen composed of cotton, and the fibres of a certain plant of the country; they clothe themselves with the coarser kinds, and dispose of the rest among the neighboring isles. This island is most exuberantly fertile, and very populous; some authors make the numbers of inhabitants to exceed sixteen thousand, and assert that there are fourteen parishes belonging to the monks of St. <HI>Augustine,</HI> three benefices of seculars, and formerly a col∣lege of Jesuits. Notwithstanding the happy soil of <HI>Panay,</HI> the in∣habitants are discouraged from taking advantage of that blessing, by reason of the neglect of the government, which leaves them un∣protected against the depredations of the piratical <HI>Malayes,</HI> who land, plunder, and carry away prisoners all those who cannot escape into the woods. These pirates are <HI>Mahometans</HI> of <HI>Borneo, Mindanao,</HI> and other islands between the <HI>Manillas</HI> and the <HI>Mo∣luccas.</HI> They infest the coasts to a high degree, and will carry away people almost from under the walls of the capital, and sell them for slaves in <HI>Borneo,</HI> and even in <HI>Batavia.</HI> They not only seize the smaller fishing vessels, but even ships richly laden.</P>
<P>THE country abounds with deer,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ANIMALS.</NOTE> wild hogs, buffaloes, oxen, and horses; the two last run at liberty, and are common to the whole island.</P>
<P>ZEBU is a small island,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ZEBU.</NOTE> but remarkable for having been the
<PB N="73" REF="81"/>first which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> colonized. It is pretended that there were, at the time the <HI>Europeans</HI> arrived, three thousand families of warlike <HI>Indians.</HI> The <HI>Spaniards</HI> have had, wherever they came, a happy talent in reducing the redundancy of people.</P>
<P>HERE, in 1598, <HI>Philip</HI> erected the town, built by <HI>Logaspi,</HI> into a city, and dignified it with an episcopal foundation; an <HI>Augus∣tine, Pietro de Agurto,</HI> first filled the see. This island was in∣dulged with sending ships to <HI>Calao</HI> in <HI>Peru,</HI> but after the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI> had made the conquest of <HI>Luconia,</HI> and given to its capital the privilege of the <HI>Manilla</HI> ships, the trade of <HI>Zebu</HI> declined fast; insomuch that its city is now sunk into a village. The passage from hence to the new world was far more expeditious than that from <HI>Manilla,</HI> having been performed in two months, and the return in three, and seldom without the discovery of some islands in the vast Pacific.</P>
<P>WE have before said, that on <HI>Matta</HI> or <HI>Mactan,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MACTAN.</NOTE> or possibly the <HI>Masbate</HI> of modern maps, a small adjacent island, <HI>Magellan,</HI> like his illustrious compeer <HI>Cook,</HI> met with a premature death from the hands of savages.</P>
<P>THE island of <HI>Mindanao,</HI> or <HI>Magindanao,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ISLE OF MINDANAO.</NOTE> is the last and most southern of the great group. Many writers separate <HI>Mindanao</HI> from the <HI>Manilla</HI> or <HI>Philippine</HI> islands, among others our judi∣cious countryman Mr. <HI>Dalrymple.</HI> Though so very near as evi∣dently to form one of that vast archipelago, the inhabitants may differ in manners, but the productions of all are nearly similar. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> have on it some unprofitable settlements, the chief is at <HI>Sambouange,</HI> in Lat. 6° 54′ N. on the south side of the island. They have fortified it with a citadel of stone and bricks,
<PB N="74" REF="82"/>and with a wooden fort, erected to check the excursion of the corsairs of <HI>Yolo;</HI> but in vain; they cannot even protect their own subjects who happen to be out of the reach of their cannon.</P>
<P>THE island extends east and west about ninety leagues,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">EXTENT.</NOTE> is tri∣angular, and the shores greatly indented by bays; the circum∣ference is said to be about eight hundred miles. It is very moun∣tanous; the vallies consist of a rich soil, black, fat, prodigiously fruitful, and finely watered with the purest rills: the sides of the mountains rocky, yet well clothed with trees of large growth. The beauty of scenery in various parts is unspeakable: we are obliged to Mr. <HI>Forrest</HI> for giving us some idea of it in his Voyage to <HI>New Guinea;</HI> in plate 19, is a view of <HI>Tetyan</HI> harbor, of <HI>La∣bugan,</HI> and of the circular harbor of <HI>Ubal,</HI> in the isle of <HI>Bunwoot,</HI> on the east side of the bay of <HI>Illano,</HI> near the great island.</P>
<P><HI>Mindanao</HI> is inhabited by several different nations,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NATIVES.</NOTE> speaking various languages, governed by sultans or rajahs. Mr. <HI>Forrest,</HI> and our faithful voyager <HI>Dampier,</HI> give accurate accounts of the manners of the country,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">HARAFORAS.</NOTE> but particularly the first. The <HI>Hara∣foras,</HI> the primitive people, now driven into the interior parts, are highly taxed and oppressed by the <HI>Mahometan</HI> nations who possess the coasts. <HI>Dampier</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyages, vol. i. p. 324.</NOTE> describes what he names the <HI>Minda∣nayans,</HI> properly so called, as men of mean stature, small limbs, strait bodies, little heads, oval faces, flat foreheads, small black eyes, short low noses, pretty large mouths, thin red lips, black teeth, black strait hair, tawny skins, inclining more to brighter yellow than other <HI>Indians;</HI> and adds, that they are of good un∣derstanding, ingenious, and active, when they chuse to exert themselves, otherwise, like all other <HI>Indians,</HI> extremely indo∣lent;
<PB N="75" REF="83"/>stately in their gait, but very civil to strangers; vindictive, and given to the crime of poisoning. The dresses of the inha∣bitants is given in one of Mr. <HI>Forrest</HI>'s plates, representing the nuptials of two young people of rank.</P>
<P>THE capital town is on the great bay of <HI>Illano,</HI> on the south side of the island, in Lat. 7° 20′ the houses, even the palace, are supported on posts, from fourteen to twenty feet high, to keep them clear of the water in the season of inundations. Cap∣tain <HI>Forrest,</HI> in his Voyage to <HI>New Guinea</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 273.</NOTE>, mentions the <HI>Lano,</HI> a great lake far inland;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">LANO LAKE.</NOTE> it is about sixty miles in circum∣ference, and in one place some hundred fathoms deep, in others ten, twenty, and thirty; has four islands, and abounds with fish. The inhabitants of its banks are called <HI>Illanos,</HI> and amount to thirty thousand, intermixed with <HI>Haraforas,</HI> all of whom are said to be very much civilized.</P>
<P>IN mentioning the productions of this archipelago,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PRODUCTIONS.</NOTE> I shall just distinguish the few that, with great uncertainty, are thought pe∣culiar to <HI>Mindanao.</HI> Gold is common to all. It has its saltpetre cave, from which much of that article is extracted; on the roofs are infinite clusters of small bats, the dung of which is supposed to be one cause of the salt; a brook of a most offensive taste and smell, and of a sky blue color, issues from the mountain which incloses the cavern.</P>
<P>THESE islands seem to produce all the animals common to those adjacent with the addition of an ugly hog,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">QUADRUPEDS.</NOTE> with great knobs over the eyes, evidently my <HI>Aethiopian Boar,</HI> Hist. Quad. i. N<SUP>o</SUP> 76; numerous in the woods, and very lean, but sweet.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="84"/>THE <HI>Civet Weesel,</HI> i. N<SUP>o</SUP> 274. The species which produces the perfume is a native of these islands; and the <HI>Fossane,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 280, is another species of spotted <HI>Weesel.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Dugung</HI> is a species of <HI>Walrus</HI> which inhabits these seas; as yet we are acquainted with only the head.</P>
<P><HI>Dampier</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyages, i. p. 321.</NOTE> mentions a <HI>Manatee,</HI> which does not weigh above six hundred weight; but he commends the flesh as being very sweet.</P>
<P>THE Birds are all enumerated in the <HI>Faunula</HI> of my <HI>Indian Zoology,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BIRDS.</NOTE> and may be known by their trivial names, and re∣ferences to M. <HI>Sonnerat;</HI> yet I shall mention a few distinguished by beauty, or any striking property.</P>
<P>THE <HI>White Turtle, Sonnerat,</HI> Voy. <HI>N. Guinea,</HI> tab. 20, is of a most glossy whiteness, with a blood-red spot on the breast, as if it had received a stab in that part. The <HI>Quail</HI> of <HI>Luconia,</HI> tab. 24, is the least of the genus, being only four inches long.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Shrike,</HI> tab. 25, flies swiftly in the air, and can balance itself like a swallow; is an inveterate enemy to the raven, which it never fails to attack, and in the end to put to flight.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Antique Shrike,</HI> tab. 114, is singular for the great hook of its upper mandible hanging far over the lower.</P>
<P><HI>Parrots</HI> are very numerous, and of various species; they en∣liven the woods with their brilliant colors, and deafen people by their cries.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Jacana,</HI> tab. 45, is most remarkable, not only by the vast length of toes and claws, characters of the genus, but by the
<PB N="77" REF="85"/>three slender shafts issuing from the greater feathers of each wing, and extending to the tail, and finished with webs like other feathers.</P>
<P>THE bird called by M. <HI>Sonnerat,</HI> p. 86. tab. 49, <HI>Le Paon Sau∣vage de l'isle de Lucon,</HI> is evidently a plover; the bill is long, a little thicker near the point; on the head is a very long crest, passing horizontal far beyond the hind part of the head, and ending in a point; things naked far above the knee; it has only three toes, and those are nearly semi-palmated; crest, head, neck, and breast, bright grey, barred with black; the top of the crest quite black; belly white; back, wings, and tail plain brown; length from the tip of the tail to the end three feet. M. <HI>Son∣nerat</HI> says, that this species is found near the Cape of <HI>Good Hope;</HI> but surely he mistakes the <HI>Umbre, Brown</HI>'s <HI>Illustr.</HI> tab. 35, for this bird.</P>
<P><HI>Le Secretaire,</HI> tab. 50. <HI>Latham,</HI> i. p. 20. tab. 2, that singular vulture, a compound of many genera, is found here as well as in the Cape of <HI>Good Hope.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>crested Spoonbill,</HI> tab. 52, has its head ornamented with a large crest, beginning a little beyond the bill, and falling be∣hind the head in a great bush; the feathers have unconnected webs, like the plumes of the <HI>Egrets.</HI></P>
<P>IN <HI>Panay,</HI> is a very small <HI>Thrush,</HI> tab. 73, not bigger than our <HI>Hedge Sparrow,</HI> of a most beautiful violet color, blue and black, all changeable; it has a most charming note, for which reason it is called the <HI>musician;</HI> they live in flocks of thousands, and make their nests in the pigeon-houses.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Coliou,</HI> tab. 74, and the crested <HI>Coliou</HI> of <HI>Panay,</HI> tab. 75,
<PB N="78" REF="86"/>are distinguished by the vast length of their tails; that of the first strait, of the other incurvated.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Hornbill,</HI> tab. 83. <HI>Latham,</HI> i. 353; the bill, as usual, great and incurvated, and each mandible marked across with se∣veral prominent moldings of a brown color, and the interme∣diate furrows pale yellow; the accessory bill is strait, and ends abrupt, about half the length of the real.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Philippine Hornbill, Latham,</HI> i. 345. <HI>Pl. Enl.</HI> 873, is black above, white beneath; the bill is vast, with the accessorial bill convex at the top and in front, one third black, the hind part white; this bird is as large as a great fowl, and the beak nine inches long.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Manilla Hornbill, Latham,</HI> i. 354. <HI>Pl. Enl.</HI> 891, has a simple bill; the head, neck, breast, and belly are white; be∣neath the cheek is a black spot; back and wings black.</P>
<P>THE above, and two species hereafter to be mentioned, are natives of these islands and of the <HI>Moluccas;</HI> their food is fruit; they inhabit the highest trees, and are the grotesque birds of the <HI>Indian</HI> archipelagos.</P>
<P>RESPECTING the trees,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PLANTS.</NOTE> shrubs, or plants of the <HI>Manillas,</HI> I must content myself with giving the few engraven by M. <HI>Son∣nerat,</HI> or described by that most industrious naturalist.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Sapotte Negro,</HI> tab. 14, a species of <HI>Achras,</HI> is a small tree, with a round green fruit, containing four kernels, in shape of an almond, much admired by the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Berkias,</HI> tab. 48, is a shrub bearing a flower of an ele∣gant form. <HI>Sonnerat</HI> puts it under the genus of the <HI>Pande∣quaqua,</HI>
<PB N="79" REF="87"/>a barbarous name. The <HI>Chiococca Racemosa, Linn. Suppl.</HI> p. 145, a lesser species, is a milky plant, see tab. 19, the juice of which is used by the <HI>Indians</HI> for healing their wounds. The larger bears an oval fruit full of seed, tab. 43.</P>
<P><HI>Le Rocou,</HI> or <HI>Atchiote,</HI> is a shrub with a small pointed fruit covered with bristles, containing numbers of seeds, which give a beautiful red dye.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Ignatia amara, Linn. Suppl.</HI> p. 149, which produces the beans of St. <HI>Ignatius,</HI> of superstitious use, grows in these islands.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Cocoa tree,</HI> tab. 61. 62. <HI>Theobroma cacao.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">COCOA TREE.</NOTE> I imagine that <HI>Linnaeus</HI> must have been a great admirer of chocolate, as he names the tree which produces it, <HI>Theobroma,</HI> or the food of the <HI>Gods.</HI> This tree is a native of the <HI>Antilles,</HI> and hotter parts of <HI>South America,</HI> and has been introduced into these islands by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> from the great fondness that nation has for its pro∣duce; otherwise they would not have given themselves any trouble about a less favored tree.</P>
<P>THE celebrated <HI>bread fruit</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Outlines of the Globe, i. p. 237. E.</NOTE>, the <HI>Soccus Lanosus, granosus,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BREADFRUIT.</NOTE> and <HI>sylvestris</HI> of <HI>Rumphius,</HI> v. p. 110. 12. 14. tab. 32. 33. 34. <HI>Artocar∣pus Incisa, G.

It begins to appear on the eastern parts of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> where it is named by the <HI>Malayes, Soccum Capas,</HI> again in <HI>Prince</HI>'s island, about <HI>Bantam,</HI> and in <HI>Malega,</HI> and finally in all the islands to the east, and from thence to <HI>Otahcite,</HI> and many others in the South Sea.</P>
<P><HI>Dampier,</HI> i. 296, first discovered it in <HI>Guam,</HI> one of the <HI>La∣drone</HI>
<PB N="80" REF="88"/>islands, and gives a very faithful description of the fruit and its uses; Lord <HI>Anson,</HI> and his great follower <HI>Cook,</HI> are full of its praises. Of late years we caught the benevolent idea of trans∣porting this tree of life to our own islands; captain <HI>Bligh</HI> had the honor of being the person deputed to convey this manna to our wretched negroes. A Satan counteracted (under the feigned form and name of the most beneficent of sects) this great benefit to our hard-fated brethren; like his great prototype he succeeded in the onset, but the adventure is resumed under the auspices of the same faithful leader, and I hope that I do not make a false prophecy if I presage success.</P>
<P>THIS fruit is the bread of the islands on which it has been be∣stowed; it grows on a tree of the size of a middling oak, and to the bulk of a child's head, and even to the diameter of twelve inches. <HI>Rumphius</HI> distinguishes the varieties into <HI>Granosus, Lano∣sus,</HI> and <HI>Soccosus;</HI> the first is the parent tree, and has in it seeds. <HI>John Reinhold Forster,</HI> plate 51. a. gives us an idea of the whole fruit, with the rind hexagonally reticulated; the majority have no seeds, as we find is often the case with the <HI>Barberry,</HI> and a few other fruits; these, therefore, are incapable of propagation, ex∣cept by suckers. In the generality of the islands, the seeded sort is quite lost, the other kind cultivated in orchards. The account of the fruit as given by <HI>Dampier, abnormis sapiens,</HI> is worthy the reader's attention;
<Q>When it is ripe it is yellow and soft, and the taste is sweet and pleasant; the natives of this island use it for bread: they gather it when full grown, while it is green and hard; then they bake it in an oven, which scorcheth the rind, and makes it black, but they scrape off the outside black crust,
<PB N="81" REF="89"/>and there remains a tender thin crust, and the inside of it soft, tender, and white, like the crumbs of a penny loaf. There is neither seed nor stone in the inside, but all is of a pure sub∣stance like bread; it must be eaten new, for if it is kept above twenty-four hours, it becomes dry, and eats harsh and choaky, but it is very pleasant before it is too stale. This fruit lasts in season eight months in the year, during which time the na∣tives eat no other sort of food of bread kind.</Q></P>
<P>THE fruit which M. <HI>Sonnerat,</HI> p. 99, calls <HI>Le Rima, ou fruit a pain,</HI> and which he has engaven in tab. 57. 58. 59. and 60, is the perfect fruit, or <HI>soccus granosus.</HI> Just beneath the rind is a series of large almond-like kernels, adhering to a central placenta, and of a farinaceous substance, which when roasted eat like ches∣nuts. The fruit itself is large and spherical; the natives of the <HI>Philippines</HI> cut it into slices, dry and eat it like bread; it will keep two years. This is the variety Mr. <HI>Ellis</HI> calls the <HI>Ducdu,</HI> and seems to make it a separate species.</P>
<P>A MINUTE orange, tab. 63,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ORANGE.</NOTE> resembling the <HI>Citrus trifoliata</HI> of <HI>Linnaeus,</HI> is found here; the fruit is very small, of a bright red co∣lor. It has no sections, but only one lodgment for the seeds. The pulp is slightly acid, and very agreeable. It may be the <HI>Ssi</HI> or <HI>Karatas Banna</HI> of the <HI>Japanese, Kaempf. Amoen. Ex.</HI> 801. 2. <HI>Thunberg, Fl. Japon.</HI> 294.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Mindanao</HI> are found three fruits engraven by M. <HI>Sonnerat:</HI> the <HI>Manssanus</HI> or <HI>Masson,</HI> tab. 94, resembling a <HI>Jujube</HI> tree; the leaves are alternate, the fruit a berry, covering a hard kernel, containing two nuts of a green color.</P>
<P>THE next is the <HI>Menichea rosata,</HI> tab. 93. The fruit is be∣tween
<PB N="82" REF="90"/>two and three inches long, oval, and containing a large nut.</P>
<P>THE third is <HI>La Houette,</HI> tab. 90, a very lofty tree.</P>
<P>BETWEEN the south end of <HI>Mindanao,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SOOLO ISLES.</NOTE> and the north-east point of <HI>Borneo,</HI> is a chain of small isles, extending about two hundred miles in length, called the <HI>Soolo,</HI> from the name of the chief island. The principal was about the middle of this cen∣tury governed by a sultan, according to M. <HI>Sonnerat,</HI> the very counterpart of <HI>Peter</HI> the Great; endowed with the same abilities, the same thirst after knowlege, and the same ambition of ap∣plying it to the improvement of his subjects. Like <HI>Peter,</HI> he quitted his throne, and took to travelling during several years. He went afterwards to <HI>Batavia,</HI> where he concealed his name and quality, and associated himself with the common sailors to learn their business. He next changed his company for that of the carpenters, to be instructed in their art. He bought tools of all sorts, and instruments of husbandry, and then returned to his throne. Still he wished for more intellectual improvement; sailed for <HI>Mecca</HI> to learn the law of <HI>Mahomet;</HI> made himself master of the <HI>Arabic</HI> tongue, brought home the use of let∣ters, and introduced money, the first ever known in the islands.</P>
<P>THIS monarch obtained possession by conquest of a small part of <HI>Borneo</HI> next to his dominions, which involved him in a quar∣rel with some <HI>Dutch,</HI> who pretended they were allies to the <HI>Bornoese.</HI> Our prince found he never could be a match for these people without the use of fire-arms. He fitted out a few ships, loaded them with articles of commerce, and sailed to <HI>Manilla,</HI> in
<PB N="83" REF="91"/>order to supply his wants. The rapacious governor seized on the monarch and all his treasure, under pretence that he intended the conquest of the island. The sultan remonstrated in vain, he endured a long captivity; his subjects, enraged at the treatment their prince had met with, made horrible ravages on the coasts of <HI>Luconia.</HI> The governor did not dare to complain, as he knew his court would not approve his conduct. He stipulated with the prince that he would restore him to liberty, provided he would consent to establish in his dominions a mission of Jesuits. He refused to comply; the Jesuits, determined on revenge and con∣quest, obtained an armament, and taking the <HI>Soolo</HI> monarch, sailed for <HI>Sambouange,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Soolo,</HI> where they landed, and laid siege to the only fort on the island. The warriors of <HI>Soolo</HI> surprised them, and drove them with disgrace to their ships. At <HI>Sambouange</HI> he found means to escape on board an <HI>English</HI> vessel, which conveyed him to <HI>Soolo;</HI> his subjects crowded to him, and he remounted his throne, to the great joy of his people; he ceded a small island to the <HI>English,</HI> and declared his ports open to all piratical adventurers, to encourage them to re∣venge his cause on the treacherous <HI>Spaniards.</HI> Mr. <HI>Forrest</HI> vi∣sited this island, and found there an <HI>English</HI> factor; it was then governed by <HI>Israel,</HI> son of the captive sultan, who had received his education at <HI>Manilla.</HI></P>
<P>MR. <HI>Dalrymple</HI> visited these islands, and left us some account of their natural history: they are particularly rich in pearls;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PEARLS.</NOTE> the banks on which the different shells are found containing those gems are of great extent; the pearl is not confined to one species of shell, Mr. <HI>Dalrymple</HI> describes several, but as he does not do it
<PB N="84" REF="92"/>scientifically, I am at a loss to define the kinds, except∣ing the <HI>Mytilus Margaritiferus;</HI> every one of these shells have in them two small lobsters, to which the <HI>Indians</HI> attribute the formation of the pearls. The banks were once pri∣vate property, and belonged to several individuals, but by the <HI>Mahometan</HI> law, they are now common even to strangers. The divers are slaves to the sultan; they seem to be hired out, and to receive a certain portion for their share. <HI>Pigafetta,</HI> the com∣panion of <HI>Magellan</HI> in his circumnavigation, visited these islands in 1521. He calls <HI>Soolo, Zolo,</HI> and says from report
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Purchas, i. 43.</NOTE>, that two pearls had been taken there, the property of the king of <HI>Borneo,</HI> which were round, and as big as hens' eggs.</P>
<P>THE swallows with edible nests swarm here; they build in caves open at top, but with their sides communicating with the sea beneath its surface. The nests are got by divers, who plunge through the entrance, and rise within the vast caverns, which are inaccessible from above.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Upas</HI> or poison tree is found in <HI>Soolo.</HI></P>
<P>MR.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ANIMALS.</NOTE> <HI>Foorest</HI> has given us a brief account of the animals; the <HI>Soolos</HI> have plenty of horses, which the ladies of fashion have learned to ride with much grace. Here are abundance of goats and cattle, but the people do not milk the cows; wild hogs swarm, and with the wild elephant do great mischief. The ele∣phants are not aboriginal, but bred from some that had been sent as presents to the <HI>Soolo</HI> princes. The <HI>Spotted Deer</HI> or <HI>Axis</HI> is found here.</P>
<P><HI>Soolo</HI> is thirty miles long and twelve broad,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">LENGTH OF SOOLO.</NOTE> and very populous,
<PB N="85" REF="93"/>which obliges the inhabitants to have recourse to agriculture in a far greater degree than others of the adjacent isles; the whole chain is said to have sixty thousand inhabitants: the soil is very fertile, and productive of most of the tropical fruits; <HI>teek</HI> trees abound here. The rainy season is very uncertain, for which reason the crops of rice cannot be depended on; yams, potatoes, and other esculents, are cultivated to supply the defect. The na∣tives have learned the art of engrafting from the <HI>Chinese</HI> settled among them. Mr. <HI>Forrest</HI> says that the cinnamon tree is found amongst these islands.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Soolos</HI> are a polished people,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NATIVES.</NOTE> probably from the examples of their two monarchs: both sexes dress with elegance; they are fond of music and dancing. Sultan <HI>Israel</HI> and his niece, could perform a tolerable minuet, and some of the people of fashion could go down a country dance. They have many slaves, to whom they are said to be very cruel, and besides are reckoned perfidious in their general dealings.</P>
<P>ANOTHER chain of islands,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SANGIR.</NOTE> of far greater length than the for∣mer, runs from the western cape of <HI>Mindanao</HI> quite to the most eastern cape of the great island of <HI>Celebes;</HI> the chief of which is <HI>Sangujan</HI> or <HI>Sangir,</HI> between Lat. 3° 30′ and 4° 30′ north; most of them are inhabited, and governed by their chieftains
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Forrest, p. 310.</NOTE>. The <HI>Dutch</HI> have now possession of <HI>Sangir,</HI> and some others, as out∣guards to the <HI>spicy</HI> isles. These, part of <HI>Mindanao,</HI> the <HI>Soolo</HI> isles, <HI>Borneo,</HI> and <HI>Celebes,</HI> bound a great and open gulph, of clear na∣vigation.</P>
<P><HI>Celebes</HI> or <HI>Macassar</HI> extends north and south between Lat.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CELEBES OR MACASSAR.</NOTE> 1°
<PB N="86" REF="94"/>55′ north, and Lat. 5° 50′ south; it is of an oblong form, but al∣most divided by two deep bays, one, which penetrates far west into the country near the north end; and another which pene∣trates still most extensively from the north, running above a hundred and fifty miles due south.</P>
<P>THIS island is prodigiously mountanous,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">VOLCANOES.</NOTE> and lofty; the mountains increase in height towards the central parts, and are generally richly clothed with wood. In <HI>Macassar,</HI> as well as in <HI>Mindanao,</HI> are some active volcanoes. Mr. <HI>Dalrymple,</HI> in the 29th plate of his elegant views of land, gives a fine idea of the country. Mr. <HI>Loten</HI> informed me that none of the <HI>Indian</HI> islands had such grand and beautiful scenery. It abounds with rivers, which spring high in the mountains, and precipitate down vast rocks, among a sylvan scene of lofty and singular trees. The lakes, and more still parts of the rivers, give security to numberless water fowl of the larger and more clumsy kinds, which retire there by fear of the crocodiles, which haunt the lower and marshy parts. Those are not deserted by the lesser palmated birds, such as ducks and teal, which being quick sighted and nimble, easily evade the approach of the enemy.</P>
<P>THIS island was discovered in 1525, by <HI>Antonio de Britto</HI> and <HI>Garcias Henriguez,</HI> who at that time commanded in the <HI>Moluc∣cas. Celebes</HI> was reckoned one of the greatest of those islands. The <HI>Portuguese</HI> established themselves here, and whether their conduct was more moderate than in other places I know not, but they gained the good opinion of the inhabitants, who pre∣served towards them the most inviolable fidelity. They kept their ground here till the year 1660, when the <HI>Dutch,</HI> with a strong
<PB N="87" REF="95"/>squadron, landed and defeated them, and their faithful ally the king of <HI>Macassar,</HI> a potent prince on the west side of the island, and near the southern end. Here the <HI>Portuguese</HI> had their colony. The <HI>Dutch</HI> expelled them, rased their churches to the ground, and seized all the effects of the Jesuits, whom they justly con∣sidered as their greatest enemies. The king made one more at∣tempt to expel these invaders; but was unsuccessful, and obliged to submit to the <HI>Batavian</HI> yoke. The <HI>English</HI> had also for a long time great intercourse with this island, for the sake of the rich productions of the <HI>Spicy isles,</HI> till at length the subtile <HI>Dutch</HI> succeeded in preventing all commerce with <HI>Macassar.</HI> The <HI>Dutch</HI> have now the monarch of this island, and all its other princes, at their command, so they may more truly be said to be the governors of the country. The <HI>Chinese</HI> are the only people who are per∣mitted to trade here to supply the wants of the islanders. The <HI>Macassars</HI> have a great commercial fishery around their island; they go in fleets of more than a hundred sail, which consist of proas from twelve to twenty tons burden, and carry from sixteen to twenty men; they go out with one monsoon, and come in with another, and send their fish to the <HI>China</HI> market; the produce of its own seas not being equal to the demand of that overstocked empire. It is remarkable that all these proas carry <HI>Dutch</HI> colors. The island itself exports gold, rice, sago, wax, and slaves; but its chief use to the <HI>Dutch</HI> is to keep other nations at a distance from the great repositories of spices. Our old voyagers seldom failed of touching at <HI>Celebes</HI> to profit of the trade.</P>
<P>I AM sorry to observe,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SLAVES.</NOTE> in the account I meet with of all the islands, even from <HI>Sumatra</HI> itself, that the infamous slave trade
<PB N="88" REF="96"/>prevales in almost every one. They are either brought to market by the piratical <HI>Malayes</HI> or <HI>Buggesses,</HI> who make them one object of their cruizes or petty invasions; or they are kidnapped by the co-inhabitants of the same islands. The <HI>Mahometans</HI> think they have the same right to hunt down and catch a <HI>Pagan,</HI> as the gentry of <HI>Liverpool</HI> or <HI>Bristol</HI> have to encourage the trepanning of a curled-pated negro: and all these bring them to market with as little remorse. I call as evidence Mr. <HI>Marsden</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sumatra, p. 213.</NOTE>, Captain <HI>Forrest</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P. 79.</NOTE>, in his voyage to <HI>Mergui,</HI> and old <HI>Dampier</HI>
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Voy. i. p. 456.</NOTE>. Slaves from <HI>Celebes, Mindanao,</HI> and even <HI>Java</HI> itself, are seen at <HI>Batavia</HI> in numbers incredible; let me do the <HI>Batavians</HI> the justice to say, that some of their slaves are kept with great neatness, and are instructed in mechanical trades. The <HI>Dutchman,</HI> fortunately for them, finds it his interest to employ them in the loom, ra∣ther than consume them under the pressure of labor, beneath a vertical sun.</P>
<P>OUR able officer, captain <HI>Carteret,</HI> in his return from his cir∣cumnavigation, attempted to put into <HI>Macassar,</HI> but was repulsed by the jealousy of the <HI>Dutch;</HI> his distress passed expression; most of his crew near the point of death, by the hardships of his long voyage; nothing could equal the unfeelingness of the <HI>Dutchman</HI>'s heart; there seemed to be little difference in its temper in the year 1768, and that of its rudest days. Mr. <HI>Carte∣ret,</HI> by amazing resolution, at length got leave to anchor and procure refreshments in <HI>Bonthain</HI> bay, about thirty miles from the capital. There he suffered all kinds of extortion, and ob∣served every species of insolence and cruelty to the natives.
<PB N="89" REF="97"/>Phlegmatic constitutions never feel for the suffering of others; their callosity is incorrigible; warm tempers may do wrong, but they soon return to their native milkiness. As to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> they forced the refreshments from them at a small price, and con∣tented themselves with a thousand per cent. profit from our com∣mander. What Captain <HI>Carteret</HI> tells us from p. 622. to p. 648. is worthy of perusal; excepting his voyage, which was most ably written by himself, all the rest of the three volumes is Mr. <HI>Hawksworth</HI>'s compilation, from the journals of the navigators.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Carteret</HI> could observe that the city of <HI>Macassar,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CITY OF MACASSAR.</NOTE> in Lat. 5° 30′, was large, and most delightfully situated. It is said also to be very strong. About <HI>Bonthain</HI> bay are numerous villages, and the country abounding with provisions and timber.</P>
<P>GREAT quantities of <HI>Sualloo,</HI> or sea slug,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SUALLOO.</NOTE> an animal of the <HI>Mollusca</HI> tribe, is fished up here, especially about the thirteen small isles called the <HI>Pater-nosters,</HI> in the streight between <HI>Celebes</HI> and <HI>Borneo;</HI> it is supposed to be a species of <HI>Actinia,</HI> and lies on the sandy bottom, and often on that which is environed with coral rocks. The fishers strike it with four-bearded iron prongs, placed parallel to each other, on the surface of two iron shot, of six or nine pounds weight, fastened to a strong line. This <HI>Sualloo</HI> sometimes weighs half a pound; numbers of boats with the crew and family on board subsist by this business, and dry it in the smoke. The black or best kind is sold to the <HI>Chinese</HI> (who use it in their nice dishes) for forty dollars a pecul; whereas the worse or white only brings in four or five.</P>
<P>THE people employed in this fishery are chiefly <HI>Badjoos;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BADJOOS PEOPLE.</NOTE> they inhabit many of the shores of the smaller islands around the
<PB N="90" REF="98"/>greater; they may be called the <HI>Tartars of the Sea;</HI> some few are stationary, living in stilted houses close to the water's edge; others live altogether in boats, and with their families shift their quarters and change their residence along with the <HI>Monsoons.</HI> Mr. <HI>Forrest</HI> computes that they have about seven hundred boats; and adds, that they live chiefly on fish, have a squealing voice, and most savage appearance. He supposes them to have been originally fugitives from <HI>Macassar, Java,</HI> and other places.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Buggesses,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BUGGESSES.</NOTE> or native <HI>Macassars,</HI> are the bravest people in <HI>India;</HI> of proved fidelity, if treated with confidence; of the deepest revenge, if insulted. They spread far and wide on the ocean in character of freebooters, and attack vessels with most astonishing desperation, especially when inspired by opium. On land their arms are lances, or slender arrows, pointed with the teeth of fish, dipped in the fatal poison of the <HI>Upas</HI> tree, which grows in this island. These arrows they blow out of hollow trunks, and hit their mark at a considerable distance. So subtile is the venom, that it almost instantaneously effects de∣struction; nor do the <HI>Macassars</HI> themselves know any remedy. <HI>Nicuhoff</HI> saw several <HI>Dutch</HI> soldiers cured by swallowing human dung, by way of a vomit; but others died, notwithstanding the filthy remedy. A certain root is spoken of growing in the island which is used as an antidote.</P>
<P>M. <HI>Tavernier</HI> was eye-witness to the rapid effect of this poison,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">EFFECT OF UPAS POISON.</NOTE> which I think too singular to be omitted: "One day," says he
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Travels, p. 191.</NOTE>,
<Q>an <HI>Englishman,</HI> in heat of blood, had killed one of the king of <HI>Macassar</HI>'s subjects; and though the king had
<PB N="91" REF="99"/>pardoned him, yet both <HI>English, Hollanders,</HI> and <HI>Portugals,</HI> fearing if the <HI>Englishman</HI> should go unpunished, lest the islanders should revenge themselves upon some of them, be∣sought the king to put him to death; which with much ado being consented to, the king, unwilling to put him to a lin∣gering death, and desirous to shew the effect of his poison, resolved to shoot the criminal himself; whereupon he took a long trunk, and shot him exactly into the great toe of the right foot, the place particularly aimed at: two chirurgeons, one an <HI>Englishman</HI> and the other a <HI>Hollander,</HI> provided on purpose, immediately cut off the member; but for all that the poison had dispersed itself so speedily, that the <HI>Englishman</HI> died at the same time.</Q></P>
<P><Q>ALL the kings and princes of the east are very diligent in their enquiry after strong poisons; and I remember that the chief of the <HI>Dutch</HI> factory and I tried several poisoned arrows, with which the king of <HI>Acheen</HI> had presented him, by shoot∣ing at squirrels, who fell down dead as soon as ever they were touched.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Boutan,</HI> a small isle near the south-east of <HI>Celebes,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOUTAN.</NOTE> is inde∣pendent, and has its sultan, who mimics all the state of a greater monarch. Our countryman, Mr. <HI>David Middleton</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Purchas, i. 238.</NOTE>, visited this island in 1609, and there passed a strong intercourse of civilities between him and the reigning prince. <HI>Middleton</HI> sailed from <HI>England</HI> with a commercial view; nor would he have been dis∣appointed, had not the king's rich magazine of goods been just burnt by his enemies. The natives are like the <HI>Mindanayans</HI> in
<PB N="92" REF="100"/>shape, and speak the <HI>Malaye</HI> language. All are <HI>Mahometans,</HI> as are the people of <HI>Celebes:</HI> the story is, that a certain king, from the arguments he had heard on the topic of religion from some <HI>Christians</HI> and <HI>Mahometans,</HI> took a great dislike to his own, but being unable to determine which to chuse, he convened a general assembly, and after a most fervent prayer to Heaven, resolved to prefer the religion of that party which should first land on his dominions: possibly the <HI>Mahometans</HI> were in the secret; their missionaries arrived, and the whole island em∣braced the doctrine of that sect.</P>
<P>I NOW descend towards the eastern end of <HI>Java,</HI> and pass through the streights of <HI>Balli,</HI> which divide <HI>Java</HI> from the island of that name.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ISLAND OF BALLI.</NOTE> The streights are narrow, rapid, and bounded by picturesque hills, many of a conoid form. This is a much-frequented passage.</P>
<P>THE island abounds with every necessary of life, both in the vegetable and animal creation. When the <HI>Dutch</HI> touched here, in their first voyage of the year 1595, they found it governed by a king, who appeared in great state, was attended by his guards, and drawn in a chariot by milk-white oxen. The great men were carried in their bamboo palanquins, and lived in the highest luxury. The religion was then <HI>Paganism;</HI> and the women, as in <HI>India,</HI> devoted themselves to the funeral pile on the decease of their husbands. In <HI>Le Promier Livre de Navigations,</HI> &amp;c. are some prints
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 49. 51.</NOTE> of the customs of the island.</P>
<P>THIS island,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SLAVES.</NOTE> and that of <HI>Macassar,</HI> has the insamy of furnish∣ing as many subjects to the slave trade as any part of the known
<PB N="93" REF="101"/>world, excepting <HI>Guinea;</HI> and they are sold with as little re∣morse as in any portion of the hardened universe.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>Balli</HI> is a long chain of islands (which I shall,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TIMORIAN CHAIN.</NOTE> from <HI>Timor Laut,</HI> call the <HI>Timorian</HI> chain) running eastward, and ex∣tends very near the coasts of <HI>New Guinea,</HI> inclining a little to∣wards the north as they approach that great island. The names of the most considerable are <HI>Lomboc, Gumbava, Ende,</HI> or <HI>Flores;</HI> from the last they are broken into smaller isles, such as <HI>Solor, Omba,</HI> and others, scattered over the sea, or grouped in clusters; <HI>Timor Laut</HI> and <HI>Arrou</HI> are the most eastern, and the largest of the latter class.</P>
<P>VERY near to the south side of <HI>Omba</HI> is the great island of <HI>Timor,</HI> which points to the south-west;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TIMOR ISLAND.</NOTE> and with the adjacent isle of <HI>Anamboa,</HI> forms a large triangular bason, of which the isle of <HI>Sandel Bosche,</HI> or sandal wood, is the western side. <HI>Timor</HI> was discovered in 1522 by the companions of <HI>Magellan,</HI> who found it full of white sandal wood. They report, that on this archipelago the disease of <HI>St. Job</HI> (which they interpret the in∣famous disease) reigneth more than in any other part of the world. I suspect it to be the horrid disease called by <HI>Bontius</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 33. Nat. Hist.</NOTE> the <HI>Amboynse Pocken.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Portuguese</HI> attempted to make themselves masters of this island, but were obliged to abandon their design, by a resistance of twenty years from the brave inhabitants. They had settled on the bay of <HI>Cupang;</HI> from which they were expelled by the <HI>Dutch</HI> in 1613, who built a fort named <HI>Concordia.</HI> They keep this island merely for the sake of making it an out-port to the
<PB N="94" REF="102"/>spicy islands, of which they have the most extreme jealousy; for there is nothing they apprehend so much as the intercourse of other nations with their usurpations in these parts. <HI>Timor</HI> yields so little profit, that, except for the reason just given, it would have been long since abandoned.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">LENGTH.</NOTE> The length of this island is near two hundred miles, the breadth about sixty; it is divided into many kingdoms, such as <HI>Cupang</HI> and others. In <HI>Dampier</HI>'s time there were many <HI>Portuguese</HI> settlements, or ra∣ther of the mixed breed; the principal is at <HI>Laphao,</HI> on the northern side; but even there he saw but three white men, the rest were copper-colored, with lank black hair; they spoke <HI>Por∣tuguese,</HI> were of the <HI>Roman</HI> catholick religion, and would be very angry if they were not thought <HI>Portuguese,</HI> as they value themselves greatly on their mongrel descent.</P>
<P>THE natives are said to be the bravest of any in all this vast archipelago,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NATIVES.</NOTE> but at the same time the most savage. They con∣ceal their nakedness by a sort of short apron, made of many narrow stripes; have bracelets round their arms, and collars of shells round their necks, and their hair stands erect. Their wea∣pons are vast sabres, made of sandal wood; with which, it is said, they can cut a man asunder at one blow. Mr. <HI>Nieuhoff</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Churchill, vol. ii. p. 316.</NOTE> gives the figures of the different wild soldiery of the islands.</P>
<P>CAPTAIN <HI>Cook</HI> passed under a considerable part of the southern side of <HI>Timor,</HI> in his return from his first voyage. The land ap∣peared very high, mountain above mountain rising in slopes from the sea, chiefly clothed with forests. In some parts were swamps and mangrove-trees; in others cleared land, the marks
<PB N="95" REF="103"/>of inhabitants; and in other places groves and coco-palms, that reached a mile inland, and close to them houses and plantations innumerable.</P>
<P>THE domestic animals of <HI>Timor</HI> seem to have been introduced there by the <HI>Europeans,</HI> except the hogs and buffaloes.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ANIMALS.</NOTE> Mon∣kies are numerous, but I believe very few other native animals. Here are infinite varieties of birds. The woods abound with bees, which produce quantities of honey and wax; and the sea with fishes and shell-fish; and as to the vegetable kingdom, it yields most of the tropical trees, fruits, and plants.</P>

<HEAD>NEW HOLLAND.</HEAD>
<P>I NOW digress to the stupendous island of <HI>New Holland,</HI> and fairly confess that the zeal of the zoologist has laid hold of me, and that a desire to investigate so fine a field, has made me wil∣lingly submit to the impulse. I shall close the original subject by returning to the <HI>Molucca</HI> islands, and breathe my last words in their spicy air, or their latitude. Little history is to be expected of the land I now visit; brief accounts of the various discoverers is all that can be given till we arrive on the eastern coast; which the unfortunate acquaintance with in 1770, has peopled with the profligate outcasts of our country, cruelly redeemed from the gibbet to undergo a lingering life of nakedness and famine in this most distant land.</P>
<P><HI>New Holland</HI> is in length from the north point, in Lat.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">VAST EXTENT.</NOTE> 11° to 46° 30′ south, about two thousand miles, and its greatest breadth from its most western part, in Long. 109° 30′, to its most eastern in Long. 152° 30′, about three thousand miles. Its extent in the southern parts is unknown, as much of the western side remains to be discovered. This vast tract proves equal in size (according
<PB N="98" REF="105"/>to the estimate of our later navigators) to all <HI>Europe.</HI> I see no reason why it should not be called a fifth continent; <HI>America</HI> itself is but an insulated continent, superior as it may be to that of <HI>New Holland.</HI></P>
<P>IN tracing the discovery of that immense region,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">DISCOVERED IN 1618.</NOTE> I shall begin at the very northern extremity, opposite to the isles of <HI>Arrou.</HI> The name it bears in that part is <HI>Arnheim</HI>'s Land, and the dis∣covery sixed in the year 1648. I shall proceed to the western side, and then surround the country till I arrive at the point I am now leaving.</P>
<P>IN Lat.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">DAMPIER'S BAY, BY DAMPIER IN 1688.</NOTE> 16° 50′ south, 119° East Long. from <HI>London,</HI> is land discovered in 1688 by our great navigator <HI>Dampier</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyages, i. 462.</NOTE>. Geo∣graphers have not even honored the spot with a name; I will therefore style it <HI>Dampier</HI>'s <HI>Bay.</HI> Our countryman took his de∣parture from <HI>Timor,</HI> and passing by a shoal of sand and rock in Lat. 13° 50′, in water so deep that he could not fathom it with his line, on <HI>January</HI> 5th he anchored in a deep bay, full of small islands, about two miles from shore. The land was low and even; with <HI>dunes</HI> at the water edge skirted with rocky points.</P>
<P>THE inhabitants were the most miserable our countrymen ever saw;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NATIVES.</NOTE> without any cloathing, except the rudest cover for their na∣kedness, consisting of nothing more than the slip of the rind of a tree for a girdle, and a little grass stuffed into it before as an apron. They were tall, strait, and thin, their limbs very small and long; their heads large, their foreheads round; they had great bottle noses, wide mouths, full lips, and their eyes
<PB N="99" REF="106"/>perpetually winking or kept shut, from their being so greatly annoyed with flies, that from habit they never open them like other people, but are obliged to hold up their heads if they wish to see any thing above their level. They have no beards, and the people of both sexes universally want two of the upper fore teeth, which they draw out; their visages are long; and their general aspect the most disagreable imaginable; their skins are coal black; their hair short and frizzled like the <HI>African</HI> negroes. They had neither houses or dwellings, but lay in the open air, and associated in companies of twenty or thirty, men, women, and children; their arms were wooden swords and lances; <HI>Dampier</HI> found many on one of the islands; they had not the appearance even of a canoe, but must have swam from place to place; and as to food, they could only collect the shells and animals flung up by the sea. They were exceedingly timid. <HI>Dampier</HI> at∣tempted to make them work in carrying water to the ship, but they had not strength or dexterity enough to carry as much as a boy of ten years of age.</P>
<P>SEA tortoises and <HI>Manatee</HI> were found in plenty on the coast,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MANATEE.</NOTE> and abundance of fish; the tides rose here about five fathoms.</P>
<P>THE trees were neither large nor numerous; one kind, exuding a red gum like the <HI>Sanguis draconis,</HI> was frequent; we shall take notice of it hereafter.</P>
<P><HI>G. F. de Witt's</HI> Land, in Lat. 19° south, was discovered,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">DE WITT'S ISLAND.</NOTE> accord∣ing to <HI>Arrowsmith,</HI> in 1616, according to others in 1628.</P>
<P>IN about Lat. 20° <HI>Dampier</HI> thought he had discovered a streight or passage to the eastward; but in all probability (see his voyage, vol. iii. p. 135) it was no more than a channel be∣tween
<PB N="100" REF="107"/>a cluster of islands. From <HI>Rosemary</HI> islands, a discovery of his in Lat.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ENDRACHT'S LAND.</NOTE> 20° 50′, the land turns southerly. <HI>Endracht</HI>'s Land lies just under the tropic of <HI>Capricorn,</HI> discovered, according to <HI>Hawkesworth</HI>'s map, in 1616.</P>
<P><HI>Dirk Hartog</HI> islands and <HI>Sharks</HI> bay are in Lat.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SHARKS BAY.</NOTE> 25°. The land so high as to be seen nine or ten leagues distant. It bore neither shrubs or trees above ten feet high. The prognostics of the approach of land were a sort of grey tern as big as a lap∣wing, and like that bird flapping its wings. The eyes encircled with black, the bill red, the tail forked.</P>
<P>SEA snakes appeared in great abundance;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SEA SNAKES.</NOTE> one species was four feet long, yellow, with a flat tail, four fingers broad.</P>
<P>THE other was smaller, and round, spotted with black and yel∣low. <HI>Dampier</HI> saw others very long and slender, others as thick as a man's leg, with a red head. This reminds me of the species described by <HI>Arrian,</HI> in his <HI>Periphus Maris Erythroei,</HI> to which he gives black skins, and blood-red eyes. I dare say his account is just, only his informer confined the color of the head to the eyes.</P>
<P>ON land was an <HI>Avosetta</HI> with the head and neck red;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">AVOSETTA.</NOTE> and a sea pie exactly resembling ours, only those parts were totally black.</P>
<P><HI>Dampier</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voy. iii. p. 85.</NOTE> also discovered a species of <HI>Kangaroo,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">KANGAROO.</NOTE> an animal with very short fore legs, which it went jumping on; but his <HI>Guano</HI> was an horrible animal, too disgusting even for him to eat, who had been used to food of all sorts, as snakes, alligators, and cro∣codiles, so offensive was this in look and smell; his description is so forcible, that we may well give him full credit.
<Q>At the
<PB N="101" REF="108"/>rump, instead of the tail there, they had a stump of a tail,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">HORRIBLE LIZARD.</NOTE> which appeared like another head; but not really such, being without mouth or eyes; yet this creature seemed by this means to have a head at each end; and which may be reckoned a fourth difference, the legs also seemed all four of them to be fore-legs, being all alike in shape and length, and seeming, by the joints and bending, to be made as if they were to go in∣differently either head or tail foremost. They were speckled black and yellow like toads, and had scales or knobs on their backs like those of crocodiles, plated on to the skin, or stuck into it as part of the skin. They are very flow in motion, and when a man comes nigh them, they will stand still and hiss, not endeavouring to get away. Their livers are also spotted black and yellow; and the body when opened has a very un∣savoury smell.</Q></P>
<P>I HAVE little doubt but that this is the horrible animal figured by <HI>Seba</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mus. Vol. i. tab. 108.</NOTE> under the name of <HI>Salamandra vera Seu Gekko Cey∣lonicus.</HI> He describes it as most dreadfully venomous, even so as to infect the very waters to such a degree, as to poison any person who is so unfortunate to drink of them.</P>
<P>HE found here green turtle weighing two hundred pounds; and abundance of large sharks, from which he gave name to the bay. In the maw of one he discovered what he calls the head of a <HI>Hippopotamus;</HI> the hairy lips were sound; and two of the teeth he pulled out were eight inches long, and a little crooked; the rest only four. I must question whether this was the real <HI>Hippopotamus,</HI> or the <HI>Dugon?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="109"/>COMMODORE <HI>Francis Pilstaert,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PILSTAERT, IN 1629.</NOTE> being sent on a voyage of discovery with eleven ships, was in 1629 wrecked in the <HI>Batavia</HI> on this coast near <HI>Edels-land,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">EDELS-LAND.</NOTE> in Lat. 28°. He escaped; returned in a skiff to <HI>Batavia;</HI> and was obliged to leave several of his crew behind. Part had conspired, and cruelly murdered the rest; but on his coming back to rescue from de∣struction those whom he had left, he seized on the miscreants, and gave them into the hands of the executioner.</P>
<P><HI>Van de Leuwins'</HI> Land,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">VAN DE LEU∣WINS, IN 1622.</NOTE> in Lat. 33° 40′, was discovered in 1622. From hence the shore runs due east for a course of some hundred miles.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PETER NUYTS IN 1627.</NOTE> In 1627 the famous commodore <HI>Peter Nuyts</HI> sailed along the coast, and made many attempts to land, but was always repulsed. Is not this a proof that the southern shores of <HI>New Hol∣land</HI> possess a superior population, and superior valor in the in∣habitants, to all the rest of the known parts of this vast country? The tract is to this day called after his name.</P>
<P>FROM certain islands called <HI>St. Francis's</HI> and <HI>St. Peter's,</HI> in Lat. 32° south, Long. 132° east, no farther discoveries have been made. The land is supposed to take a southern curvature, and to contract its breadth gradually. The course is marked with the dotted line, nor do we recover land till we reach the very southern extremity, which spreads to no great breadth; one side ends in <HI>South-west Cape,</HI> in Lat. 43° 37′, the other in <HI>South Cape,</HI> in Lat. 43° 42′, and the land from each runs northward.</P>
<P>THIS part of <HI>New Holland</HI> was discovered in 1642,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TASMAN, IN 1642.</NOTE> by <HI>Abel Tas∣man,</HI> who was sent for that purpose by the states; he named it <HI>Van Diemen</HI>'s Land, gave names to several islands and bays, and made some remarks on the country; if he was accurate,
<PB N="103" REF="110"/>they prove a variety in the inhabitants. He says they were a large-made people, of a color between brown and yellow; their hair long, and almost as thick as that of the <HI>Japanese,</HI> and that like them they combed it up, and fixed it at the top of their heads with a pin. They covered their middle with a mantle, some with a kind of mat, others with a sort of woollen cloth; their ingenuity might reach the fabricating a mat, but I doubt the possibility of the latter.</P>
<P>IN 1773, <HI>Tasman,</HI> after a long interval,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CAPTAIN FURNEAUX, IN 1773.</NOTE> was followed by captain <HI>Furneaux,</HI> who had been separated from captain <HI>Cook,</HI> and di∣rected his course for the purpose of pursuing the discovery of the <HI>Dutch</HI> navigator; he fell on the very same country, and found the same bays and headlands observed by <HI>Tasman.</HI> He saw the land eight or nine leagues distant; it was rather high, broken, and with bold shores, but beaten by a most violent surf: it probably having the whole weight of the Antarctic ocean from the very pole rolling on this great headland.</P>
<P>THE soil here was black, rich, but thin
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cook's last voyage, i. 112.</NOTE>,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SOIL.</NOTE> the sides of the hills covered with trees, and the view greatly beautified by the vast cataracts, tumbling from immense heights, and a rock with fluted pillars, possibly <HI>basaltic.</HI> Captain <HI>Furneaux</HI> saw none of the natives, but met with their miserable wigwams, and some bags and nets in which they carried their provisions, and also a stone to strike fire with, and some tinder.</P>
<P>IN <HI>January</HI> 1777,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CAPTAIN COOK, IN 1777.</NOTE> this country was visited in person by our great navigator, who had the good fortune to meet with some of the natives, who came to him with the utmost confidence, and
<PB N="104" REF="111"/>without any sign of fear.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NATIVES.</NOTE> They were of the common stature, slender, black, and with hair as frizzled as any negroe, but not distinguished by remarkable thick lips or flat noses, and their features far from disagreeable; their teeth were good, but very dirty; nor did they want any of the upper fore teeth, as <HI>Dampier</HI> observed in those whom he saw. The hair of these was clotted with a sort of red ointment, and their faces were painted with the same; they had bushy beards on their chins and upper lips, which was another variation from the most northern people, yet the eyes of these were by no means affected like the miserable na∣tives of the environs of <HI>Sharks</HI> bay. The hair of the women was cut or shaven, sometimes wholly, sometimes partially; and some had a circle of hair left, like the tonsure of the <HI>Roman</HI> catholick clergy. The men were quite naked, the women had the skin of the <HI>Kangaroo</HI> tied over their shoulders, and round their waists; the skins of both sexes were marked with scars.</P>
<P>THEIR habitations were little wigwams, made of sticks covered with bark;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">DRYADES.</NOTE> others reminded you of those of the <HI>Dryades</HI> of the poets: they formed a hollow in the vast trees of the country, to the height of six or seven feet, which they effected by fire; they left so much untouched that the tree grew most luxuriantly, and gave the image of <HI>Tasso</HI>'s enchanted grove: this is the only forest tree of the country; the bark is white, the stem quite strait, and clear of branches to the height of sixty feet; it yielded a transparent gum or resin, and the leaves of the lesser branches had an aromatic smell. The wood is very long and tough, fit for spars, oars, and even masts, for which purpose, could it be made ligther, none would be better.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="112"/>No other species of quadrupeds were observed here, but the <HI>Opossum, Hist. Quadr.</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 223, and the <HI>Kangaroo,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 229. Captain <HI>Cook</HI> very humanely turned into the woods a boar and sow pig, which if they escape the sight of the natives for some years, may prove the stocking of the country with animals equally useful to the inhabitants and casual visitants.</P>
<P>ABUNDANCE of fish are found on the coast, as the <HI>elephant</HI> fish, rays, soles, flounders, and the <HI>Atherina Hepsetus</HI>

<P>THE first port which Captain <HI>Cook</HI> put into in the voyage of 1777, was <HI>Adventure Bay,</HI> in Lat. 43° 21′,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ADVENTURE BAY.</NOTE> between the <HI>Fluted Cape</HI> and Cape <HI>Frederick Henry.</HI> He continued his voyage towards <HI>New Zealand.</HI> The coast to the north had been explored by Captain <HI>Furneaux,</HI> who passed in his way southward <HI>Maria</HI>'s island, <HI>Schoutens,</HI> and other places named by <HI>Tasman.</HI> As we ad∣vance farther north, we find <HI>Furneaux</HI>'s and the <HI>Sisters.</HI> The last is in Lat. 39° 45′, and Long. 149°, the land from which he bore away for <HI>New Zealand.</HI></P>
<P>IN Lat. 38° south, Long. 211°, we arrive off Cape <HI>Hicks,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. CAPE HICKS.</NOTE> which may be celebrated as the first place ever discovered on the eastern coast of <HI>New Holland;</HI> this great event took place on <HI>April</HI> 19th.
<PB N="106" REF="113"/>1770, under the auspices of Captain <HI>Cook.</HI> It was in this voyage that Mr. <HI>Banks</HI> (afterwards Sir <HI>Joseph</HI>) and doctor <HI>Solander,</HI> were his philosophical companions.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TROPIC BIRD.</NOTE> A tropic bird was seen in Lat. 38° 29′, an uncommon sight, as it very rarely exceeds the limits of the tropics. Proceeding northward, he passed by a mountain he called the <HI>Dromedary.</HI> On the twenty-seventh, he observed the wondering natives collected on the rocks, in admiration of the novel sight;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOTANY BAY.</NOTE> and on the 28th anchored in <HI>Botany Bay,</HI> of later years well known, as the common retreat of the unfortu∣nate brave!</P>
<P>THE natives of these parts differed very little from those ob∣served in the more southern latitudes.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NATIVES.</NOTE> There can be no doubt but our appearance was very hostile; they were diffident of us to the highest degree, declined all intercourse, and refused all our presents: our navigators certainly did not use the arts of con∣ciliating their affections. After frequently treating them with a volley of small shots on their legs, or more muscular parts, we are not to wonder at their dislike to the strangers who had visited their coasts. Their wants, by reason of the happiness of the climate, did not demand cloathing, and their minds were su∣perior to the accepting of gew-gaws; but they were frequently pressed by hunger.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Endeavour</HI> river, they boldly came on board the ship, and seeing plenty of turtle, wished to have a share; they seized on two, trusting to the rites of hospitality, or the justice of partaking of the provisions found in their own seas (to which they had a natural title); instead of that they were roughly treated, and so highly irritated, as to take an instant revenge, by setting fire to
<PB N="107" REF="114"/>the grass that surrounded our tents: they were brave to a degree of temerity; two have been known to oppose the landing of forty of our people: their offensive weapons were swords made of some hard wood, and darts or lances, armed at the end with fishes bones, or the spine of the sting rays; their defensive arms a round buckler. They were painted like the people of <HI>Van Diemen</HI>'s land, and as an additional ornament, had a great bone of some bird stuck through their noses, and another through each car. Mr. <HI>Parkinson</HI> gives a good representation in plate xxvii. of two of the natives armed for fight, and in the attitude of com∣bat: as to cloathing, neither sex made the least attempt to con∣ceal their nakedness.</P>
<P>THESE people, savage as they may seem, are not ignorant of the rudiments of drawing; Mr. <HI>Phillip</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voy. to Botany Bay, p. 106.</NOTE> observed on many of the rocks figures of animals, shields, weapons, and even men; and one in particular of a man beginning to dance, and this in rather a superior style: surely it must be admitted that people thus tinctured with a liberal art, are capable of civilization under proper treatment.</P>
<P>WHAT religious rites they have is unknown, but it is evi∣dent, from the same authority
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ib. p. 138.</NOTE>, that they burn their dead.</P>
<P>THEIR habitations are most miserable; they lie under the pro∣tection of some great pieces of bark flung over a ridged frame, made of boughs of trees
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ib. p. 102. tab. 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THEIR food are fish, shell fish, or any thing they can collect on the shores. They have a most artless species of canoe, made of bark, stretched on a frame, and tied together at each
<PB N="108" REF="115"/>end; two, sometimes more, will venture in one of them; they keep along the shoals to strike the fish, which appears to be their principal subsistence; they also eat the fowls, or the few quadrupeds they can contrive to take. On many of the tall trees were cut notches in the stems to facilitate their ascent. They seemed to conceal themselves on the top, and by that means surprise the birds as they alight, or catch them at roost; or from this situation, kill with their lances any beast that chances to pass beneath. As to their cookery, they content themselves with eating their meat raw, or at best with giving it a slight broiling over their fires.</P>
<P>THE country is hilly, but not mountanous; part covered with tall trees, quite clear from underwood; in some parts near the shores, were extensive tracts hid by brushwood; and in many places swamps full of the <HI>Mangrove,</HI> or <HI>Rhizophora mangle</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Catesby, ii. tab. 63.</NOTE>. Many rills discharge themselves into <HI>Botany</HI> bay, but it wanted depth of water to give room for ships of large size. The soil in places was black and fat, and gave Captain <HI>Cook</HI> reason to believe it would be productive of any sort of grain. The trees were filled with birds of most beautiful colors, particularly those of the parrot tribe. The country abounded with plants, and from that circumstance the harbor was called <HI>Botany Bay.</HI> All this coast was named <HI>New South Wales,</HI> from the extreme south to the extreme north; a denomination given near two centuries ago to part of the territories adjacent to <HI>Hudson</HI>'s bay.</P>
<P>IN the year 1787,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">OUR CON∣VICTS SENT THERE.</NOTE> when we began to be at a loss about the disposal of our criminals, legislature was advised to banish into
<PB N="109" REF="116"/>this country, all those who had been by royal mercy re∣prieved from death, or who had been convicted of crimes liable only to the punishment of transportation to our late co∣lonies.</P>
<P>AN act was passed for that purpose in the same year, and in consequence a fleet was prepared to convey to this distant country as many convicts, as at that time fell under the penalty of the law. The <HI>Syrius</HI> frigate was fitted out to convoy the governor. The gentleman selected for the arduous charge was captain <HI>Arthur Phillip,</HI> who had long served in our navy with great credit,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">GOVERNOR PHILLIP.</NOTE> and for some time was engaged in the service of <HI>Portugal,</HI> during part of which he with great good conduct and humanity per∣formed a duty similar to that his country now committed to him; for he was employed once, if not oftener, in conveying the criminals of that nation to its colonies of the <HI>Brazils.</HI></P>
<P>THE governor sailed from <HI>Spithead</HI> on <HI>May</HI> 13th, 1787. On <HI>June</HI> 3d he and his fleet reached <HI>Teneriff;</HI> on <HI>August</HI> 5th an∣chored off <HI>Rio de Janeiro;</HI> on <HI>October</HI> 13th in <HI>Table Bay,</HI> at the cape of <HI>Good Hope,</HI> which he left on <HI>November</HI> 12th in the <HI>Supply;</HI> reached <HI>Botany Bay</HI> on <HI>January</HI> 3d, 1788, having per∣formed, in a bad sailer, a voyage of seven thousand miles in fifty∣one days; the <HI>Syrius</HI> and the whole convoy anchored safely in the bay on the 19th and 20th of the same month.</P>
<P>IT is a popular opinion that the expence of transportation of the convicts amounted to three hundred pounds a man, including the provision made for their cloathing and support for some small time after their landing. I was in hopes that two pamphlets, published by <HI>Debrett</HI> in 1791, 1792, under authority of govern∣ment,
<PB N="110" REF="117"/>would have confirmed or refuted the report, especially as one of them pretended to give an account of the expences; but the detail is so very imperfect, that I am not able to satisfy either my own or the reader's curiosity.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Phillip</HI> had previously taken a most exact survey of every part of the proposed place of settlement; he found it bad as a port, and from the wet nature of the environs, sus∣pected that the air would affect the health of the new co∣lonists. He observed that Captain <HI>Cook</HI> mentioned a bay, in Lat. 33° 5′ south, very little distant from the other, which he had named <HI>Port Jackson,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PORT JACK∣SON.</NOTE> and where he thought there was good anchorage. Mr. <HI>Phillip</HI> lost no time, but made a thorough ex∣amination of that also; he found it equal at least to our celebrated harbor, <HI>Milford Haven,</HI> in old <HI>South Wales.</HI> It opens with an ample mouth, and after some space, divides into two most exten∣sive meandering branches, with numbers of other small bays, creeks, or coves, pointing again to the right and to the left, so as to form the finest and most secure harbor in the world, capable of containing the navies of <HI>Europe</HI> itself.</P>
<P>HERE Mr. <HI>Phillip</HI> determined to establish his colony;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SYDNEY COVE.</NOTE> and fixing on a place which he named <HI>Sydney Cove,</HI> began immedi∣ately to trace the outlines of the first street of his intended town. The officers live in huts, but houses are building of brick and stone; the governor is very moderate in that designed for him∣self, which contains only six rooms. The land allotted for cul∣tivation has been found to be very good, and to return on the first trial two hundred bushels of wheat, and sixty of

</TABLE>.</NOTE> The destruction made by rats was very great; in a short time they destroyed not less than twelve thousand pounds of flour and rice, brought over with the first transportation. There are also vegetables in plenty, from seeds brought from <HI>England.</HI> I cannot enter into the account of the whole proceed∣ings; by the detail given in the two pamphlets published by <HI>J. Debrett,</HI> imperfect as they are, may be seen the humanity of government in providing every necessary for the use of the con∣victs, yet I fear it has been disappointed in its hopes. The im∣mense expence we have been at in sending provisions from hence, from the cape of <HI>Good Hope,</HI> and from <HI>China</HI> (notwithstanding the glossing over several particulars) gives reason to imagine that our colony has been at the point of starving.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Kangaroo,</HI> and others of the Opossum tribe, may be eaten, but those animals, which never were numerous, will soon become extinct in the neighborhood of the colony, and we dare
<PB N="112" REF="119"/>not, for fear of the natives, trespass beyond our bounds; the <HI>New Hollanders</HI> still continue very hostile. Fish is found in plenty, but the turtle, on which we seemed to have some dependence, is a very precarious article.</P>
<P>THE colony looks up for support to a little spot called <HI>Norfolk Island,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NORFOLK ISLAND.</NOTE> in Lat. 29° south, Long. 168° east. It contains from twelve to thirteen thousand acres, and does not exceed in circumference sixteen miles, is very mountanous, and covered with a thick wood, choaked up with underwood; it is surrounded with cliffs forty fathoms high, and quite perpendicular, excepting at a few creeks, dignified with the name of bays, to which often a raging surf denies all approach.</P>
<P>THE island is happy in many streams of fine water, some co∣pious enough to turn a mill. The mold, in places freed by our people from trees, is the richest and deepest in the world; abun∣dance of pumice-stones and porous red <HI>lava</HI> is scattered over its surface, and even mixed with the soil, giving strong reason to suppose it to have been of volcanic origin.</P>
<P>A SMALL colony was detached,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">COLONIZED.</NOTE> on <HI>February</HI> 14th, 1788, from <HI>Jackson Port</HI> to this island, in hopes of its contributing in time to the support of the parent state. It consisted only of a su∣baltern officer, a surgeon, two men who understood the cultiva∣tion and dressing of flax, nine male and six female convicts; and over them was appointed Lieutenant <HI>King,</HI> of the navy, sole go∣vernor of this sea-girt reign. With his little colony he passed the singular interval of above two years, till he received, on <HI>March</HI> 6th, 1790, a mighty reinforcement of two companies of marines, five men and three women from the civil department,
<PB N="113" REF="120"/>and a hundred and sixteen male and sixty-seven female convicts. This detachment sowed wheat and barley from <HI>May</HI> to <HI>August,</HI> and got in their harvest in <HI>December,</HI> which produced twenty∣five fold. Mayz succeeds well; the sugar-cane, vines, and oranges thrive exceedingly; and potatoes produce two crops in a year. All kinds of garden plants come to good perfection. The rat (its only quadruped) was at first a pest to the colony. If this isle proves the nursing mother to our establishment at <HI>Port Jackson,</HI> as the isle of <HI>Anglesea,</HI> or <HI>Môn mam Cymru,</HI> is said to have been to <HI>Wales,</HI> I shall think it the prodigy of the age.</P>

<P>THERE is little doubt but all the pelagic birds of these Lati∣tudes frequent the coasts, <HI>Albatrosses,</HI> both the <HI>common</HI> and the <HI>yellow-nosed,</HI> and various other species.

<P>LIEUTENANT <HI>King,</HI> the historian of the isle,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TREES.</NOTE> enumerates five species of trees which afford good timber, the Pine, live Oak, a yellow wood, a hard black wood, and one like the <HI>English</HI> Beech; of these we can only ascertain one, the <HI>Cypressus Columnaris</HI>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">CYPRESSUS COLUMNARIS.</NOTE>. This magnificent tree grows to the height of a hundred and eighty, and even two hundred and twenty feet, and is from six to nine feet in diameter; eighty feet clear of branches, and with eighty or ninety feet of sound timber

<P>THE <HI>Areca Sapida Solandri</HI>
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">G. Forster, Pl. Esc. 66.</NOTE> is a useful tree,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ARECA SAPIDA.</NOTE> for it yields a cabbage like the <HI>Areca Oleracea,</HI> or cabbage-tree; but Captain <HI>Cook</HI> compares the taste more to that of an almond than a cab∣bage, and adds, that it proved an excellent resource as an esculent.

<P>THESE are the only plants which the sparing communications of our philosophical travellers will permit us to mention. The last is of the greatest importance to the natives, and may hereafter become so to every nation in <HI>Europe,</HI> as it produces the best and most tenacious hemp in the world. I shall deliver the descrip∣tion and history of it, borrowed from vol. iii. p. 39. of Captain <HI>Cook</HI>'s First Voyage: "There is," says our great navigator,
<Q>however, a plant that serves the inhabitants instead of hemp and flax, which excels all that are put to the same purposes in the world. Of this plant there are two sorts; the leaves of both resemble those of flags, but their flowers are smaller and their clusters more numerous; in one kind they are yellow, and in the other a deep red. Of the leaves of these plants, with very little preparation, they make all their common apparel; and of these they also make their strings, lines, and cordage for every purpose, which are so much stronger than any thing we can make with hemp, that they will not bear a compa∣rison.
<PB N="117" REF="124"/>From the same plant, by another preparation, they draw long slender fibres, which shine like silk, and are as white as snow; of these, which are also surprisingly strong, the finer cloths are made; and of the leaves, without any other preparation than splitting them into proper breadths and tying the strips together, they make their fishing nets; some of which, as I have before remarked, are of an enor∣mous size.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Norfolk Island</HI> is peculiarly happy in its climate:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CLIMATE.</NOTE> the air is pure, salubrious, and delicious, freed from excessive heat by the constant breezes from the sea; and of so mild a temperature throughout the winter, that there is a perpetual vegetation; crop succeeds crop, and the refreshing showers maintain a con∣stant verdure: sometimes there are great droughts. From <HI>Fe∣bruary</HI> to <HI>August</HI> may be called the rainy season; not that it is regular, for there is sometimes fine weather for a fortnight to∣gether, but when the rain does fall, it is in torrents.</P>
<P>ABOUT midway between <HI>Norfolk Island</HI> and <HI>New Holland</HI> is <HI>Lord Howe Island,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">LORD HOWE ISLAND.</NOTE> discovered in 1788 by Lieutenant <HI>Henry Lidg∣bird Ball,</HI> a son of the late <HI>George Ball,</HI> of <HI>Irby,</HI> in <HI>Cheshire,</HI> Esquire. This isle is small in extent, in length only seven leagues, and in form of a crescent. In some parts it rises into lofty craggy hills, that called <HI>Ball's Pyramid</HI> is very singular, formed on one side of <HI>Basaltic</HI> columns; and so lofty as to be seen at the distance of twelve leagues. Another rock is circular at top, so as to look like a spread fan; the rest so low as to give these rocks the form of islands. Mr. <HI>Ball</HI> says that it abounds in cabbage-palms, or <HI>Areca Sapida,</HI> with mangrove-trees, and <HI>Man∣chineel,</HI>
<PB N="118" REF="125"/>or <HI>Hippomane Mancinella</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Catesby, i. 95.</NOTE>, which spread even to the tops of the mountains. <HI>Lord Howe Island</HI> swarms with birds, such as parrots, parroquets, large pigeons, and several other land birds; also gannets in infinite numbers, rails, white gallinules, like those of <HI>Norfolk Isle,</HI> and a land fowl of a dusky brown color, with a bill four inches long, feet like a chicken, very fat, and very good food.</P>
<P>THE coast swarms with fish; but what will render this island of unspeakable use to our colonists, are the amazing abundance of turtle which frequent its shores during summer, and may be taken in that season in any numbers; but at the approach of winter they all retire northward. <HI>Norfolk Island</HI> also abounds with fish, and in the season with very fine turtle.</P>

<HEAD>FAUNULA.</HEAD>
<P>I WILL now continue the subjects of natural history of the great country I have just quitted, collected from the materials furnished by Sir <HI>Joseph Banks,</HI> by Mr. <HI>Phillip,</HI> by the surgeon-general Mr. <HI>John White,</HI> and by others who have accidentally contributed their share. A <HI>Faunula,</HI> not unacceptable to natu∣ralists, will now be given. I never want opportunity when I speak of birds, of making my due acknowledgments to my worthy and ingenious friend Mr. <HI>Latham,</HI> for the ready means I find from his excellent Ornithology of selecting the various subjects. I shall begin, as usual, with the quadrupeds, and refer for a more ample account to the new edition of my History of
<PB N="119" REF="126"/>Quadrupeds lately published. In all this vast land there does not appear a single species of hoofed animal; none of the ape kind, and very few <HI>genera</HI> of quadrupeds have been hitherto disco∣vered in any one part.</P>

<P>THE genus of <HI>Opossum</HI> furnishes more species than any other found in this country,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">OPOSSUM.</NOTE> and some of them of most singular and wonderful kinds. The first I mention is related to the <HI>Pha∣langer Opossum,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 226.

<P>LIZARDS and serpents are very numerous in <HI>New Holland:</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">LIZARDS.</NOTE> Mr. <HI>White</HI> has given several good figures of different species; they are all of the innocent tribe; among the first the <HI>Seine-formed lizard,</HI> tab. 30, distinguished by its short thick tail; the <HI>muri∣cated,</HI> tab. 31, with rows of sharp pointed scales, and a very long
<PB N="131" REF="138"/>tail; an elegant striped species, tab. 32; and that most singular one the <HI>broad-tailed, Nat.

Mr. <HI>Phillip</HI> has engraven another he calls the <HI>laced,</HI> tab. 48, forty inches long, tail included, which has its name from the lace-like disposition of the colors.</P>
<P>AMONG the serpents, Mr. <HI>White</HI> exhibits, in tab. 31,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERPENTS.</NOTE> a small one, a foot long, white, marked with black equidistant bands; another, in tab. 43, of a bluish color; a third, in tab. 45, eight feet long, dusky, varied with spots of yellow; and in tab. 46, are two small snakes, one dusky with small spots of yellow, the other encircled with black and white.</P>
<P>SEA serpents are very frequent in the seas of <HI>New Holland,</HI> and of various species; all the sea serpents are distinguished by their thin flat tails, and by their having no scales on their belly.</P>
<P>AT p. 100 I have mentioned three species observed by <HI>Dam∣pier,</HI> iii. 90, 93, on the western coast of this country; to them I can add one wholly black, iii. 130. Authors have described others of this singular kind; such is the <HI>Coluber laticaudatus</HI> of <HI>Mus. Ad. Fred.</HI> tab. 16. fig. 1. <HI>Gmel. Lin.</HI> 1106: the belly is dusky, the back and sides fasciated with ash color and brown; perhaps this is the species said to be venomous, for in the upper jaw are two short moveable fangs. <HI>Linnaeus</HI> marks this species with (♂) his fatal sign. It is found off the coasts of <HI>South America,</HI> and the isle of <HI>Tanga-tabu</HI> in the south seas. All these sea snakes seem to be confined to the torrid zone of the <HI>Asiatic</HI> seas, or to the warmer parts. They are more plentiful about <HI>New Guinea</HI> and <HI>New Holland;</HI> their history remains very obscure.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="139"/>THE <HI>Anguis Platuros, Gmel.

<P>RAYS are very numerous, and of several kinds, in all the shal∣lows of this coast; some weigh near three hundred pounds. A species of sting-ray is very common, and furnishes, with its spines, the head of one of the most dreaded weapons of the natives.</P>
<P><HI>Dampier,</HI> vol. iii. tab. 3, adds the large species of <HI>Tunny,</HI> and
<PB N="133" REF="140"/>the <HI>Chaetodon,</HI> commonly called the <HI>Old Wife,</HI> and another long fish in tab. i.</P>
<P>I SHALL conclude this account of the fishes with the descrip∣tion of a most singular amphibious species: "It was,"
<NOTE PLACE="marg">AMPHIBIOUS FISH.</NOTE> says the historian <HI>(Hawksworth,</HI> iii. 529)
<Q>of the most remarkable kind, about the size of a minnow, and had two very strong breast fins; we found it in places that were quite dry, where we sup∣posed it might have been left by the tide, but it did not seem to become languid by the want of water, for upon our approach it leaped away, by the help of the breast fins, as nimbly as a frog; neither did it seem to prefer water to land, for when we found it in the water, it frequently leaped out and pursued its way upon dry ground; we also observed, that when it was in places where small stones were standing above the surface of the water, at a little distance from each other, it chose rather to leap from stone to stone, than to pass through the water, and we saw several of them pass entirely over puddles in this man∣ner, till they came to dry ground, and then leap away.</Q></P>
<P>Two crabs are described, of a new species,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CRABS.</NOTE> and one of most exquisite beauty; it had all its claws and joints of the most lovely ultramarine color, and the under side of so pure a white, and of so delicate a polish as to resemble the white of the finest por∣cellane; the other was marked with blue, but more sparingly, and the back with three brown spots: perhaps these differed only in sex.</P>
<P>WHOSOEVER reads the following meagre <HI>Florula</HI> of <HI>New Hol∣land,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PLANTS.</NOTE> will be amazed at the few plants which I have been able to
<PB N="134" REF="141"/>ascertain, especially when the numbers of its botanical produc∣tions are so highly boasted. Indignant at the concealment, I begin my list.</P>
<P>THE genus of <HI>Banksia</HI> opens the <HI>Florula;</HI> under this are seven species:</P>
<P><HI>Banksia serrata,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BANKSIA.</NOTE> <HI>White,</HI> p. 221. tab. 18. 19. 20; in which are expressed bud, flower, and fruit.</P>

<P>THIS genus was first named by <HI>John Reinhold Forster,</HI> in his <HI>genera,</HI> in honor of Sir <HI>Joseph Banks.</HI></P>
<P>To these I add the three following:</P>
<P><HI>Banksia dentata, Linn. Suppl.</HI> 127.</P>
<P><HI>Ericaefolia, Linn. Suppl.</HI> 127.</P>
<P><HI>Integrifolia, Linn. Suppl.</HI> 127.</P>
<P><HI>Casuarina Stricta, Hort. Kew.</HI> iii. 320.</P>

<P>THE yellow gum plant of <HI>Phillip,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">YELLOW GUM TREE.</NOTE> p. 60. tab. 3, grows in form of a <HI>yucca;</HI> has a stem of considerable thickness, scaled regu∣larly; the leaves are very long, out of their middle rises the fructification, on a slender stem, twelve or fourteen feet high; of this the natives sometimes make spears. The gum, or rather resin, is dug from under the roots, and is possibly what <HI>Tasman</HI> calls <HI>Gum Lac of the Ground;</HI> it also exudes from the body both voluntarily and on incision. Mr. <HI>White,</HI> p. 235, says it may vie in its properties with the most fragrant balsams, and when burnt smells like balsam of <HI>Tolu,</HI> or <HI>Benzoin.</HI> It is a good pectoral me∣dicine,
<PB N="135" REF="142"/>and very balsamic. It is not soluble in water, but readily in spirits of wine. The genus is not ascertained.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Peppermint Tree,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PEPPERMINT TREE.</NOTE> the supposed <HI>Eucaliptus obliqua</HI> of <HI>L'Heretier, Sert. Angl.</HI> p. 18, grows to the height of a hundred feet, and thirty in girth
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">White, p. 206, tab. 23.</NOTE>; the leaves are lanceolate and pointed, marked with numerous resinous spots, in which the essential oil resides; the berries grow in clusters, and are open at top. The oil extracted from the leaves is so like that which is drawn from our peppermint, that Mr. <HI>White</HI> called the tree by that name. The oil has been proved to be more efficacious than any other medi∣cine for removing colicky complaints.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Tea Tree</HI> of the same author, p. 229. tab. 24,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TEA TREE.</NOTE> is of the genus of <HI>Melaleuca.</HI> Mr. <HI>White</HI> supposes it to be the same with the <HI>Camunium</HI> of <HI>Rumph. Amboin.</HI> v. p. 29. tab. 18, which grows in <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Amboina.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Sweet Tea</HI> is another shrub;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SWEET TEA SHRUB.</NOTE> both make a tea not un∣pleasant, and this is said to be a good antiscorbutic.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Red Gum Tree,</HI> or <HI>Eucaliptus Resinifera, White,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">RED GUM TREE.</NOTE> p. 231. tab. 25; grows to the size of our large stoaks; the wood is brittle, and good for nothing but fuel; it contains a vast quantity of red gum, like the gum <HI>Kino.</HI> Some of our voyagers compare it to gum dragon. A single tree, on incision, will yield sixty gallons. It dissolves almost entirely in spirits of wine, and gives them a red color. In dysenteries (which our convicts were much af∣flicted with) it was found full as efficacious as the gum <HI>Kino.</HI></P>
<P>MR. <HI>Hawksworth,</HI> iii. p. 569, has favored us with the secret,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">HIBISCUS BILIACEUS.</NOTE> that the <HI>Hibiscus Biliaceus</HI> grows here. It is the <HI>Mohoe,</HI> or bark tree of the <HI>West Indies; Sloane, Jam.</HI> i. p. 215. tab. 134. fig. 4;
<PB N="136" REF="143"/>and the <HI>Novella</HI> and <HI>Daun Baru</HI> of <HI>Amboina;</HI> see <HI>Rumph.</HI> ii. p. 218. tab. 73. This might be a tree of vast service to this country, were its uses known to the poor natives. Those of the South Sea islands make all their cordage, excellent fishing nets, and packthread, of the bark. It is also of great use in cloathing, and may be divided into pieces of any thickness. Specimens, brought over as curiosities, shew the fibrous texture so fine, as to look like an elegant lace. It is found in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> or other hot parts of <HI>America,</HI> in most of the South Sea islands, in <HI>Su∣matra, Celebes,</HI> and <HI>Amboina.</HI></P>
<P>MR. <HI>Hawksworth</HI> also tells us, that the only sort of fruit here is one resembling a cherry, but of a very disagreeable taste; it is of the kind called by the <HI>Dutch</HI> in the <HI>East Indies, Pyn Appel Boomen.</HI> A wild plantane, very small, full of stones, and well tasted, perhaps the <HI>Musa troglodytarum</HI> and <HI>Pissangbatu</HI> of <HI>Rumph. Amboin.</HI> v. p. 132, and the <HI>Musa granulosa</HI> of <HI>G. Forster, Pl. Esc.</HI> p. 31, may be added.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Hawksworth</HI> besides informs us, that there was a fruit they called, from the color, a plum, small, and shaped like a flatted cheese; and a third like a purple apple. Let me add the fruit of the <HI>Anacardium Orientale, Rumph. Amboin.</HI> i. 177. tab. 69, the tree of which, say the voyagers, was never seen by the <HI>European</HI> botanist. And this is the sum of the knowledge of botany imparted to us.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Arum Colocasia,</HI> or <HI>Cocco Root</HI> of the <HI>West Indies,</HI> is found here; (see <HI>Hawksworth,</HI> iii. 564. 590.) <HI>Rumphius</HI> has en∣graven it in vol. v. p. 313. tab. 109.

<P>A POOR kind of <HI>Fig,</HI> probably the <HI>Ficus Granatum</HI> of <HI>George Forster, Pl. Esc.</HI> 36; and <HI>Sydney Parkinson</HI> speaks, (p. 144.) of a <HI>Cycas Circinalis,</HI> or Sago Tree, and a <HI>Glycine Rosea.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Cabbage Tree,</HI> or <HI>Areca Sapida,</HI> just mentioned (which may be cut through with a single stroke of the axe) is the only tree of any use in building. Miserable consideration! The very largest trees, lofty and spacious as they appear, are, when sawed, so brittle that they fall to pieces. There are, says Mr. <HI>White,</HI> (p. 179.) only three kinds of timber trees, none of which will float on water.

<P>THE attention that <HI>Dampier</HI> shewed to almost every thing which came in his way,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PLANTS OBSERVED BY DAMPIER.</NOTE> is evident by his bringing home from <HI>New Holland</HI> several specimens of plants.

The descriptions and figures are in the third volume of his voyage, p. 109, &amp;c.

<P>CLAY is discovered, which makes good bricks; but no lime∣stone has as yet been found. As to shell lime, the quantity is so small, that it is impossible to collect sufficient for use. How fatal are these defects to the progress of architecture in <HI>Hol∣landia Nova.</HI> Neither are there any hopes of its becoming a ma∣rine power, as it wants timber fit even to build a boat. <HI>Norfolk Island,</HI> I fear, must not only be its nursing mother, but the re∣source for the support of its marine.</P>
<P>MULTITUDES of nuts and fruits of distant regions are fre∣quently flung in great abundance on this coast,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">EXOTIC NUTS, &amp;c. CAST ON SHORE.</NOTE> brought thither by the wind and waves, as those of the <HI>Antilles</HI> are to the shores of <HI>Norway,</HI> or the <HI>Scottish Hebrides.</HI> Among them are cocoa∣nuts in abundance; but all are covered with <HI>Balani,</HI> or other marine productions, a sure sign of the length of the voyage. They are supposed to have been brought by the trade winds, which blow full on this shore, and to have come from <HI>Terra del Espirito Santo,</HI> or the <HI>New Hebrides Islands,</HI> visited by Captain <HI>Cook</HI> in 1774.</P>
<P>LET me now resume the coast. At the small distance of eight miles to the north of <HI>Port Jackson</HI> is <HI>Broken Bay,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BROKEN BAY.</NOTE> a name given by Captain <HI>Cook,</HI> when he passed it by on his departure north∣wards. It was examined by Mr. <HI>Phillip</HI> in <HI>March</HI> 1788
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voy. p. 76.</NOTE>, found to be extensive, and to have two mouths; one impeded by a bar, so that the entrance is impervious except by small vessels; the other capable of admitting ships of the greatest burden. The land here was higher than that about <HI>Port Jackson,</HI> more rocky,
<PB N="140" REF="147"/>but equally covered with timber. Trees of great size grow on the tops of the most inaccessible mountains. The country was populous; and it was observed that most of the women had the two joints of the little finger cut off: most of the men wanted the right front tooth; their <HI>septum narium</HI> was perforated, and had a bone or stick thrust through it. The want of language kept our voyagers ignorant of the cause of these strange cus∣toms. Their skins were singularly scarred from the crown of the head to their feet; the scars prominent, and seemed as if filled with wind.</P>
<P>IN another excursion Mr. <HI>Phillip</HI> made to this bay,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">HAWKESBURY RIVER.</NOTE> he disco∣vered a very considerable river, which he named the <HI>Hawkes∣bury;</HI> it was from three hundred to eight hundred feet wide, and navigable for the largest merchant ships as far as a hill named <HI>Richmond Hill,</HI> about forty-five miles from its discharge into the bay: but it is not safe for ships to go so high up, because of the heavy rains; the water rises thirty feet above its usual level; the vessels therefore ought not to approach nearer than fifteen or twenty miles from the foot of the hill, where they may lie secure in fresh water. <HI>Richmond Hill</HI> is called the head of the river; for there it divides into two branches, grows shallow, and was seen for some way, till lost in the wooded rocks of the country.</P>
<P>ANOTHER river was discovered,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NEPEAN RIVER.</NOTE> which Mr. <HI>Phillip</HI> named the <HI>Nepean,</HI> from three to four hundred feet broad, which also over∣flows its banks in hard rains, to the same height as the former, into which it is supposed to fall. The soil on both these rivers is excellent; the banks well wooded. Wild ducks inhabit these
<PB N="141" REF="148"/>waters in great numbers; and here were first seen the black swans. A cataract at the foot of <HI>Richmond</HI> hill prevented the party from proceeding any further in boats. That hill is the termination of a chain of mountains, which runs northward, and probably joins those that range nearly parallel to the coast from fifty to sixty miles inland. The difficulty of reaching these hills is very great; for after the first day's journey, is such a succes∣sion of ravines, many with sides inaccessible, that our people could not proceed above fifteen miles in five days. They therefore returned to await the arrival of the floods, to swell the <HI>Nepean,</HI> when they hoped they could reach these mountains by water.</P>
<P>FROM the entrance into <HI>Port Jackson,</HI> as far as Lat. 25° 3′,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">INDIAN HEAD.</NOTE> the coast keeps due north; from a point called <HI>Indian Head</HI> it begins to incline to the west.</P>
<P>A LITTLE farther is <HI>Bustard Bay,</HI> in Lat. 24° 4′,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BUSTARD BAY.</NOTE> which takes its name from a new species of bustard shot there, with a black band across its breast. Its weight was seventeen pounds. It proved excellent eating. Mr. <HI>Latham</HI> mentions it in vol. vii. p. 227.</P>
<P>AT <HI>Keppel's Bay,</HI> in Lat. 22° 50′,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">KEPPEL'S BAY.</NOTE> the coast begins to be filled more or less with islands. In about Lat. 21° 27′ is the bay of <HI>Inlets,</HI> from the various sounds that seem to penetrate deeply into the land, between the islands. After a long range of coast, partly impeded with isles, and partly free, in Lat. 16° 6′, is cape <HI>Tribulation.</HI> Off this cape the <HI>Endeavour,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PROVIDENTIAL ESCAPE.</NOTE> on Sunday <HI>June</HI> 10th 1770, struck on a coral rock, and remained immoveable, except by that species of motion which ground away the sheathings,
<PB N="142" REF="149"/>and by admitting a torrent of water, threatened speedy destruc∣tion to the whole crew. The rising tide, which might remove her out of the present situation, redoubled the anxiety, for pro∣bably she would then instantly sink into the depth of ten or twelve fathoms. A thought<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> suggested by Mr. <HI>Monkhouse,</HI> a young midshipman, saved them from destruction; he advised the dropping a sail, covered with oakum and wool, over the outside, and hauled under the ship's bottom with ropes till it reached the leak; they executed his plan, and from the suction of the sail by the water, into the most dangerous of the leaks, the ship was enabled to keep afloat, when it was re∣leased from the rock by the tide, and the <HI>redeemed,</HI> to get into a secure place to repair the damage. On this critical occa∣sion, not an oath was heard among our sailors; the habit of profaneness, however strong, being instantly subdued, by the dread of incurring guilt when death seemed to be so near. A gentleman then aboard mentioned to me one effect of fear, that of being seized with a most intolerable thirst; but as soon as their safety was ensured, their minds and their bodies returned to their wonted tones. No cape or river was distinguished by the title of Providence, or any grateful memorial. Mr. <HI>Hawks∣worth,</HI> in his own mind, seems to have been conscious that some∣thing ought to have been said; his wondrous apology in his wondrous preface, is certainly the greatest wonder that the world ever wondered at. In the preface, in the pages xix. xx. xxi. may be seen the strange embarrassments that a good man labors under, when he compliments his patrons with his con∣science, and servilely gives up the cause of truth.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="150"/>A NEIGHBORING river, in Lat. 16° 30′,

<P>THE <HI>Termes destructor</HI> makes its curious nest in the trees of this country.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TERMES.</NOTE> A black species, which artfully works out the pith of the branches of a tree, and finds secure shelter in the hollow, were common. <HI>Rumphius,</HI> ii. 257, found the same species in the branches of the <HI>Arbor regis</HI> in <HI>Amboina.</HI></P>
<P>ANOTHER kind is like the white ant of the <HI>East Indies;</HI> it forms two sorts of retreats; one of the size of a man's head, suspended in clusters from the boughs of a tree, made of agglu∣tinated fragments of vegetables, containing innumerable cells. These are most fully inhabited, and have communications with each other, and the nests themselves with all the rest which are suspended on the same tree. These again have another
<PB N="144" REF="151"/>avenue along the stem, leading to a retreat formed at the root of some tree, but not the same with that which holds their pendulous nests. This is made of earth, and is about six feet high.</P>
<P>A LITTLE to the north of <HI>Endeavour</HI> river are cape <HI>Bedford</HI> and cape <HI>Flattery;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CAPE BEDFORD AND CAPE FLATTERY.</NOTE> off them is a cluster of small isles, and most numerous reefs. Let me here acquaint the reader of the very perilous situation of our illustrious seaman, during his three months navigation. He sailed all that time in a channel bounded by the land on one side, and to the seaward by a reef of rocks, or coral banks, not less tremendous, extending the length of three hundred and sixty leagues. Within this reef he was obliged to anchor at night, with the thunder of the surge foam∣ing over it; expecting inevitable destruction from the breaking of the cables, or from the driving of the ship, which she often did to a certain degree. The man at the chains was perpetu∣ally heaving out the lead, without omitting it a moment; and under such circumstances did our navigator escape. It was na∣tural for him to wish to enjoy the open sea; soon after he left <HI>Endeavour</HI> river, by ascending a lofty isle, he saw the opening in the reef in Lat. 14° 8′, which with consummate abilities and courage he attempted, and with success. The instant he got beyond the breakers, he met with a rolling sea, and no ground with a hundred and fifty fathoms of line; a certainty he had obtained his wish. The island from which he had made his observation, was one of the three called the islands of <HI>Direction,</HI> that strangers in future might find the passage.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="152"/>NEW dangers now awaited him; a vast sea came rolling from the east, and brought him nearer and nearer the perils he sought to shun. The same billow which had washed the side of the ship, broke to a tremendous height upon the adjacent rocks, leaving beneath an unfathomable watery valley, no broader than the base of that single wave. Two light breezes saved them from the jaws of death. After the most arduous ef∣forts, they got through another favorable opening in the reef, through which the ship was carried by a current of amazing rapidity. They now exulted in recovering that very situation they had so long labored to extricate themselves from. The opening was not more than a quarter of a mile wide; yet the force of the torrent carried the ship exactly in the mid-way. Here it was impossible not to be grateful to Heaven. Captain <HI>Cook</HI> called this salutary gap <HI>Providential Inlet,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PROVIDENTIAL INLET.</NOTE> and this proof of piety remains both in the book, and in the chart. The impiety of expunging it would have been too glaring.</P>
<P>THESE coral reefs are most surprising operations of nature;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CORAL REEFS.</NOTE> they rise like a wall almost perpendicularly out of the unfathom∣able deep, and at low water are dry in many places; here the enormous waves of the vast southern ocean, meeting with so abrupt a resistance, break with inconceivable violence, in a surf which no rocks or storms in the northern hemisphere can pro∣duce.</P>
<P>To form these stupendous works, nature makes use of no other instruments than a little worm, contemptible to vulgar eyes. Well may we join in the fine apostrophe of <HI>Pliny,</HI> in his
<PB N="146" REF="153"/><HI>tam parvis atque tam nullis, quae ratio, quanta vis, quam inextri∣cabilis perfectio!</HI></P>
<P>THESE reefs are composed of various kinds of coral. The <HI>Tubipora musica</HI> is mentioned among them, and they give shelter to numbers of beautiful shells, and <HI>Mollusca;</HI> among the former are the <HI>Chamae,</HI> some so large that two men can scarcely move them.</P>
<P>WITHIN the reef, from the inlet to <HI>York Cape,</HI> the whole channel is filled with small isles, rocks, or coral rocks.</P>
<P><HI>York Cape</HI> is in Lat. 10° 37′ south, the land trends from it fast to the west; the sea to the north-east is full of islands, one beyond the other. These captain <HI>Cook</HI> called <HI>Prince of Wales's Islands,</HI> and supposes they reach quite to <HI>New Guinea.</HI> The passage between <HI>New Holland</HI> he called <HI>Endeavour</HI> Streights;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ENDEAVOUR STREIGHTS.</NOTE> exulting in having been the first who proved the entire insulation of this vast land. The length of the streights was ten leagues, the breadth about five, except at the north-east end, where they were contracted by the isles to two leagues; the depth from four to nine fathoms, and the tide rose twelve feet. He now hoisted <HI>British</HI> colours, took possession of the country in the name of his Majesty, and called the isle on which the ceremony was performed, <HI>Possession Island;</HI> most of the islands were well clothed with herbage and wood, apparently well inhabited; and the natives of both sexes quite naked.</P>
<P>CAPTAIN COOK now pursued his voyage to <HI>New Guinea.</HI> The distance between the opposite point of <HI>New Guinea,</HI> and the most northern of <HI>New Holland</HI> is only two hundred and
<PB N="147" REF="154"/>ten miles. We here nearly rejoin the place we left to perform our circuit of the country. The land on the western extremity of <HI>Endeavour</HI> streight, and the eastern point of <HI>Arnheim</HI> Land, forms the entrance into the great gulph of <HI>Carpentaria,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CARPENTARIA.</NOTE> which runs due south far into the land. It received its name from the <HI>Dutch</HI> general <HI>Carpenter,</HI> the zealous promoter of discoveries in these parts about the beginning of the last century.</P>

<P>WE now proceed to the <HI>Molucca</HI> islands,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ARROU ISLES.</NOTE> and taking a course due north, pass between those of <HI>Timor-laut</HI> and <HI>Arrou.</HI> The last is the most eastern of the <HI>Timorian</HI> chain, and forms a group consisting of three or four larger isles, and a multitude of little rocks and reefs closely clustered, adjoining the east end of <HI>Arrou</HI> proper. We are now arrived within reach of the perfumed air of the <HI>Molucca,</HI> or famous spicy islands, a land of romance, where nature assumes a new shape in picturesque scenery, and in the beautiful and singular form of numbers of the animal and vegetable creation, whether inhabitants of land or water.</P>
<P>THE long celebrated <HI>Manucodialae,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BIRDS OF PARADISE.</NOTE> or birds of paradise, first begin to appear in these islands. These birds, so singular in the structure and disposition of their feathers, so elegant in their form, and so romantic in their history, gave occasion, soon after their discovery, to the supposition of their having been the celebrated Phoenix of the antients. The learned <HI>Forster,</HI> with his usual depth of judgment, hath collected every thing relating to that ideal bird,
<PB N="149" REF="156"/>in his <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>German</HI> translation of the <HI>Indian Zoology,</HI> and effectually disproved that the invention originated from any one of this <HI>genus.</HI> I refer the reader to his disseration, and barely mention, that the antient describers of the <HI>Phoenix,</HI> give it the form and size of an eagle, with an exquisite richness of coloring; they say that it lived Dclx years, and at the completion of that period, formed its nest with the twigs of the most odoriferous trees, and died upon them. A young one sprung from its re∣mains, and conveyed them to <HI>Panchaia,</HI> the city of the sun, per∣formed the funeral rites, and placed them on the altar. <HI>Pliny,</HI> from whom this relation was taken, adds, that it was reported one had been brought to <HI>Rome,</HI> but, with his usual good sense, stamps on it the charge of fiction.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the remoteness of the native country of this whole genus, I cannot absolutely affirm the impossibility of the antients being acquainted with some of the species. They had from distant times a regular trade with <HI>India.</HI> Before the days of <HI>Ptolemy,</HI> they pushed their navigation beyond the peninsula of <HI>Malacca</HI> to <HI>Cattigara,</HI> the modern <HI>Ponteamas,</HI> and the <HI>Metropolis Sina,</HI> the present <HI>Cambodia.</HI> Notwithstanding the antients might have penetrated no farther, yet, as the <HI>Indians</HI> were extremely commercial, the <HI>Romans</HI> might receive from them accounts of the most distant isles, their commodities, and even their curiosities. The birds of <HI>India</HI> were known to the <HI>Romans;</HI> it is possible that they might have seen, or at least heard of those of <HI>Paradise:</HI> no words could better suit these most sin∣gular species, than <HI>discolores maxime et inenarrabiles</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plin. Lib. 10. cap. 11.</NOTE>, birds of
<PB N="150" REF="157"/>different colors, and not to be described; and few are more dif∣ficult to be represented in words, than those of this genus.</P>
<P>THE time in which they were brought to <HI>Europe</HI> was very early, and I suspect long before they were observed by any na∣turalists. There is reason to believe that the <HI>Turks</HI> received them by means of the <HI>Arabians,</HI> who procured them from <HI>India</HI> by their commerce on the <HI>Red sea</HI> or <HI>Persian gulph,</HI> and sold them for ornaments to the turbans of the great officers of the <HI>Janis∣saries. Belon</HI> first took notice of them, and credulously believed them to have been the <HI>Phoenix;</HI> in one place he supposes them to have been the <HI>Rhyntaces;</HI> he justly describes them as forming a vast mass of feathers issuing from a small body, out of which the <HI>Arabians</HI> had extricated the flesh; which agrees with the usual method of preparation. <HI>Nicholas de Nicholai</HI> actually gives the figure of a captain of <HI>Janissaries</HI> ornamented with its plumes: <HI>Gesner</HI> is the first who caused this bird to be engraven, and his figure and that of <HI>Clusius</HI> was long copied by succeeding natu∣ralists.</P>
<P>FEW birds are more circumscribed in their limits than the Birds of Paradise. They are confined within the <HI>Papua</HI> islands, and that of <HI>New Guinea,</HI> and are found only from Latitude 8° south, to Lat. 3° north of the equator, and between Longitude 127 and 140.</P>
<P>SUCH is the general view of these wonderful birds.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">COMMON.</NOTE> The <HI>Paradisea Apoda</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lin. Syst. 166. Pl. Enl. 254.</NOTE>, of which there are two varieties called the greater and lesser birds of Paradise, chiefly inhabit the <HI>Arrou</HI> isles
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Edw. 110. Latham, ii. 471.</NOTE>. They are natives of both <HI>New Guinea</HI> as well as of these islands, are supposed to breed in the first,
<PB N="131" REF="158"/>and to reside there during the wet monsoon, but retire to the <HI>Arrou</HI> isles, about a hundred and forty miles to the east, during the dry or western monsoons. In the east monsoon they moult their long feathers, but recover them in the west. They always migrate in flocks of thirty or forty, and have a leader, which the inhabitanss of <HI>Arrou</HI> call the <HI>King:</HI> he is said to be black, to have red spots, and to fly far above the flock, which never desert him, but settle where he settles. They constantly avoid flying with the wind, which ruffles and blows their loose plumage over their heads, and often forces them down to the ground, from which they are unable to rise without some ad∣vantage; hard showers of rain are equally destructive to them. When they are surprised with a strong gale, they instantly soar to a higher region, beyond the reach of the tempest; there they float at ease in the serene sky, on their light flowing feathers, or pursue their journey in security; during their flight they cry like starlings, but in the distress of a storm blowing in their rear, they express it by a note resembling the croaking of ravens.</P>
<P>WHEN they alight, it is on the highest trees, the <HI>king</HI> taking the lead; they prefer the <HI>varinga parvifolia</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rumph. iii. tab. 90.</NOTE>, on the berries of which these birds and various sorts of parrots feed; some say that they feed on nutmegs, on butterflies, and even small birds; the strength of their claws favors that opinion; yet that circum∣stance may also be requisite to birds, which are always to live perched. The natives of <HI>Arrou</HI> watch their arrival, and either shoot them with blunt arrows, or catch them with bird-lime or
<PB N="152" REF="159"/>nooses; when taken, they will make a vigorous resistance, and defend themselves stoutly with their bills; they are instantly killed, exenterated, and the breast bone taken out, then dried with smoke and sulphur, and exported to <HI>Banda,</HI> where they are sold for half a rix-dollar, but on the spot for a spike nail, or a bit of old iron. They are exported to all parts of <HI>India</HI> and to <HI>Persia,</HI> to adorn the turbans of people of rank, and even the trappings of the horses, as I have before mentioned; they even reach <HI>Turkey</HI>

<P>No birds have ever had so much fable mixed with their history; it was believed, that they remained always floating on the spicy <HI>Indian</HI> air, and of course not to be in want of legs or feet, of which they were supposed to be destitute; that when they wanted to sleep, they hung themselves by their two long feathers to the boughs of a tree; that they performed the act of love during their flight, and that even ovation, and exclusion of the young was discharged in that element, the male receiving the egg in an orifice nature had given it for that purpose; that they lived on the dew of Heaven, and had no evacuation like other mortal birds. From their being so much conversant in the higher regions, the <HI>Portuguese</HI> styled them <HI>Passaros da sol,</HI> or <HI>Sparrows</HI> of the <HI>Sun;</HI> the islanders <HI>Manu-co-dewata,</HI> or the birds of <HI>God,</HI> and most of the <HI>Europeans</HI> name them the <HI>birds of Paradise.</HI> So happily did the opinion work on the little kings of the isles, that seeing them descend (as it often happened) dead from the heavenly regions, they became converts to the truth of the im∣mortality of the soul.</P>

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING voyagers give an exact locality to the different species of these birds, I cannot readily assent to the opi∣nion, as the whole extent of the residence of the genus is so small, that it is improbable but that each of them must at times trespass beyond their pretended bounds.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Arrou</HI> islands have been under the jurisdiction of <HI>Banda</HI> since the year 1623; they are low, flat, and well peopled with blacks. It was reckoned that in 1703, there were about two hundred and forty christians. Off one of the islands is a fishery of small pearl, but the chief trade is <HI>Sago;</HI> and slaves, which they kidnap in <HI>New Guinea,</HI> and sell to the <HI>Dutch</HI> at <HI>Banda.</HI></P>
<P>I AM so deficient in materials, that I must hasten to the next isles, or those of <HI>Banda;</HI> let me premise, that the intervening expanse of water, has sparingly scattered over it several small islands, distant from each other, one of them called by <HI>Dam∣pier,</HI>
<PB N="154" REF="161"/>the <HI>Burning Isle,</HI> and was, when he passed by it in 1699
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyages, iii. p. 180.</NOTE>, a most fierce volcano.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Banda</HI> islands lie in about Lat. 4° 30′
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BANDA ISLANDS.</NOTE>, south, and are in∣cluded under the general name of the <HI>Spicy Islands.</HI> Their names are <HI>Gonnipo, Banda</HI> (which gives name to the whole group) <HI>Lontare, Poolaway,</HI> and <HI>Pooloroon.</HI> These, and the neighboring <HI>Moluccas,</HI> were discovered at the same time, in 1511, by <HI>Francis Serrano,</HI> and <HI>Antonio D'Abreau,</HI> who were sent on that service by the great <HI>Albuquerque;</HI> they spent some years in the discovery. The <HI>Portuguese,</HI> to deter other nations from paying attention to these sources of wealth and luxury, gave out that they were scarcely approachable by reason of the shal∣lowness of the seas; <HI>Pigafetta</HI> disproved the report, by sounding the coasts, and finding a depth of a hundred and two hundred fathoms.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Chinese</HI> were the first who had made themselves masters of these islands.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHINESE.</NOTE> The <HI>Javans</HI> and the <HI>Malayan</HI> Moors next suc∣ceeded, and with them were introduced the religion and language of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> which in these and the <HI>Moluccas</HI> found their most remote but wonderful extent.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PORTUGUESE.</NOTE> The <HI>Portuguese</HI> arrived after them at the period just mentioned. <HI>Argensola</HI> represents some of the kings of these little islands as incredibly powerful, and asserts, that they could collectively raise above a hundred and twenty thousand fighting men. The prince of <HI>Ternate</HI> was the most potent; he was lord of seventy-two isles.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Portuguese,</HI> by violence or treachery, established them∣selves in these valuable possessions. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> indeed laid
<PB N="155" REF="162"/>clame to them under the false pretence that they were first dis∣covered by <HI>Magellan;</HI> the <HI>Spanish</HI> fleet, in the reign of <HI>Charles</HI> V. sailed to the <HI>Moluccas:</HI> the <HI>Portuguese</HI> were engaged in war with the king of <HI>Ternate,</HI> and the monarchs of <HI>Tidor</HI> and <HI>Gilolo,</HI> who sided with the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> but about that time <HI>John</HI> III. thought proper to make his brother-in-law <HI>Charles</HI> a present of three hundred and fifty thousand ducats, on condition the <HI>Por∣tuguese</HI> should remain in quiet possession till the sum was repaid. Notwithstanding this, <HI>Charles</HI> offered them to sale to <HI>Henry</HI> VII. but the bargain never took place.</P>
<P>IT is ridiculous to consider that <HI>Charles</HI> V. clamed these islands by virtue of the famous line of <HI>demarcation,</HI> by which Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> VI. in 1493, divided, by his infallible power, between the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Portuguese,</HI> all countries which should be dis∣covered on the side of a certain meridian drawn by his holiness from pole to pole, allotting one part to <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and <HI>Isabel</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> the other to <HI>John</HI> II. of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and their successors
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Osorio, ii. 268.</NOTE>. This <HI>Alexander</HI> did in hopes of preserving peace in the world, but the effect proved the reverse. I must refer to <HI>Osorio,</HI> and others who have treated on the subject.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Dutch,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">DUTCH.</NOTE> after some unsuccesful attempts for the discovery of a north-east passage to the <HI>East Indies,</HI> determined to follow the course of the enterprizing <HI>Portuguese.</HI> In 1595 they resolved to share in the rich adventure; four ships, with no more than two hundred and forty-nine men, sailed from the <HI>Texel</HI> on <HI>April</HI> 2d; they saw the Cape of <HI>Good Hope</HI> on <HI>August</HI> 4th; touched at <HI>Madagascar,</HI> and on <HI>January</HI> 1st, 1546, reached the streights
<PB N="156" REF="163"/>of <HI>Sunda.</HI> Near <HI>Bantam</HI> they met with their antient enemies the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> who had long been master of these seas; they instantly attacked some of their merchant ships, one of which, burnt by the <HI>Portuguese</HI> themselves, had fifty tons of cloves on board; another, which they took, had twenty; this foretaste of the riches of the islands, whetted their resolution of pursuing their plan, and of supplanting the tyrants in this invaluable branch of commerce. The second voyage was performed under the conduct of the great <HI>Heemskirk</HI> in 1598. From <HI>Bantam,</HI> he sailed with four ships to the very <HI>Moluccas,</HI> found the most cor∣dial reception from the monarchs of <HI>Amboina</HI> and <HI>Ternate,</HI> and returned laden with cloves, nutmegs, mace, pepper, and cinna∣mon: fleet followed fleet: the <HI>Dutch</HI> attacked the <HI>Portuguese</HI> in all parts of the islands, and never desisted till they had, in 1603, completed the conquests of both the <HI>Banda</HI> and <HI>Molucca</HI> islands. At this period <HI>Portugal</HI> was subject to the crown of <HI>Spain.</HI> In 1605, <HI>Philip</HI> III. determined to recover these distant territories: he sent his orders to <HI>Don Pedro D'Acunha,</HI> a gallant officer, go∣vernor of the <HI>Philippines,</HI> to take the command of the expedition. He sailed with a numerous fleet, attacked <HI>Ternate,</HI> took that island, and in a short space reduced the whole to his master. This conquest was but short lived; the <HI>Dutch</HI> returned in great force, and favoured by the <HI>reguli</HI> of the islands, repossessed them∣selves of the whole, and to this day remain entire masters of what is justly styled the <HI>gold mines of Holland;</HI> they immediately destroyed every nutmeg-tree they could find on the adjacent islands, built small forts on every one that lay to the south and to the west, as out posts to prevent the access of other <HI>European</HI> na∣tions,
<PB N="157" REF="164"/>executed with the most cruel rigour all smugglers; and to this day became sole masters of the trade in nutmegs, mace, cloves, and cinnamon.</P>
<P>THE <HI>English</HI> visited the <HI>Spice Islands</HI> in the year 1602,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ENGLISH.</NOTE> in their first voyage to the <HI>East Indies.</HI> Sir <HI>James Lancaster,</HI> during his stay at <HI>Bantam</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Purchas, vol. i. p. 162.</NOTE>, fitted out a small pinnace, and furnishing it with such articles as he thought would be acceptable to the natives, dispatched it to the <HI>Moluccas</HI> under the command of Mr. <HI>William Starky.</HI> The pinnace returned after the departure of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> and forwarded to <HI>England</HI> the first cargo of nut∣megs and cloves it ever received in a bottom of its own.</P>
<P>IN our second voyage the fleet was commanded by Sir <HI>Henry Middleton,</HI> knight, who, in 1604, after a month's stay at <HI>Bantam,</HI> sailed directly for <HI>Amboina,</HI> leaving two ships to take in a cargo of pepper. From <HI>Amboina</HI> the admiral went to the <HI>Moluccas,</HI> and dispatched the other ship, commanded by Mr. <HI>Colthurst,</HI> to <HI>Banda;</HI> we are not told the circumstance of this voyage, any more than that Sir <HI>Henry</HI> returned to <HI>England,</HI> and that the <HI>Dragon,</HI> his principal ship, lost by sickness forty-three out of fifty-three men, between <HI>Bantam</HI> and the Cape.</P>
<P><HI>William Keeling,</HI> commander of the expedition which was made in 1667, was the first who began a regular commerce with the <HI>Spicy Islands.</HI> He reached <HI>Banda</HI> on <HI>February</HI> 8th, 1608; de∣livered his monarch's, <HI>James</HI> the First's, letter and presents at <HI>Nera,</HI> the capital town, and obtained leave to establish a factory at <HI>Puloway;</HI> he actually built a house, but the jealous <HI>Hollanders</HI> pulled it down, when <HI>Keeling</HI> returned to <HI>England</HI> with a rich
<PB N="158" REF="165"/>cargo of spices. We persisted in our lucrative voyages, and, notwithstanding the numberless obstructions we met with from the <HI>Dutch,</HI> formed a settlement in these islands. The natives of <HI>Banda,</HI> on a quarrel with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> by a formal instrument, made a resignation of their island to us; and those of <HI>Lantore</HI> did the same. In 1620 <HI>Puloroon</HI> and <HI>Puloway</HI> were also added to the <HI>British</HI> dominions, and our peaceful monarch assumed the title of king of those islands: he also received the most friendly epistles from his brother kings of <HI>Ternate, Tidor,</HI> and <HI>Bantam.</HI> The accounts given by old <HI>Purchas,</HI> vol. i. from p. 701 to 705, are well worth the reader's perusal. These cessions were con∣firmed by treaty between <HI>James</HI> I. and the <HI>Dutch</HI> in 1619; not∣withstanding which, at the very conclusion of a treaty, they de∣termined on our expulsion. They attacked with a strong force <HI>Lantore</HI> and <HI>Poleroon;</HI> they ravaged the islands, seized our fac∣tories and magazines, and after stripping the factors naked, first whipped them, loaded them with irons, and after all massacred them, by flinging them over the walls, and in the most savage manner dragged their remains in chains through the streets. The quantity of spices seized by these barbarians will serve to give an idea of the extent of our commerce: they found in our magazines twenty-three thousand pounds of mace, and a hun∣dred and fifty thousand pounds of nutmegs. The narrative of these proceedings are preserved in the eighth volume of <HI>Church∣hill</HI>'s Collection, but it is too horrible to be repeated; and the apology of the <HI>Dutch</HI> so futile and so false as not to merit the recital. <HI>Cromwell,</HI> in 1654, had the glory of compelling the <HI>Dutch</HI> to restore to us the island of <HI>Poleroon,</HI> and to make ample
<PB N="159" REF="166"/>satisfaction for their barbarities at <HI>Amboina.</HI> As to <HI>Poleroon,</HI> it was kept but a very short time; for in 1664, in the inglorious reign of his profligate successor, it was taken from us by a single ship.</P>
<P>THE Abbé <HI>Raynal</HI> gives the following description of these islands: "They seem," says he
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. i. p. 139.</NOTE>,
<Q>to have been thrown up by the sea, and may with reason be supposed to be the effect of some subterraneous fire. Lofty mountains, the summits of which are lost in the clouds, enormous rocks heaped one upon another, horrid and deep caverns, torrents which precipitate themselves with extreme violence, volcanoes perpetually an∣nouncing impending destruction; such are the phaenomena that give rise to this idea, or assist in confirming it.</Q> By the sequel of my account it will appear that the Abbé's description and inference seem to have been very well founded.</P>
<P>THIS is the general view of them. I collect the following particulars of those of <HI>Banda</HI> (the <HI>Moluccas</HI> I reserve till my ar∣rival on their coasts): the first called <HI>Gonnapo,</HI> or <HI>Goenong-api,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">GOENONG-API.</NOTE> in 1621 emitted fire, smoke, and cinder; and had, perhaps, long before left neither woods, fruits, or water. The eruptions have been at times so violent as to carry desolation to part of the neighboring island of <HI>Banda,</HI> overwhelming the woods and greatest trees, and to fling stones of three or four tons weight from one island to the other. Even in the last year (1791) we are informed, that it made a very considerable cruption. In the Phil. Trans. Abridg.
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. p. 393.</NOTE> is an account of a most horrible eruption of this mountain in <HI>November</HI> 1694, attended with noises like the discharge of artillery. It cast up such a quantity of stones as
<PB N="160" REF="167"/>entirely to fill a noted fishing place in the neighboring sea of the depth of forty fathoms, so as to leave it entirely dry. The same volume fully accounts for the appearance of these islands, and the <HI>Banda,</HI> so graphically described by the <HI>French</HI> Abbé. In the year 1693 and 1694 several other islands, as if by consent, raged with volcanic fury. The mountains of <HI>Celebes, Sorea, Ter∣nate, Banda,</HI> and <HI>Neyra,</HI> at one time, cast up fire, lava, ashes, cinders, and boiling water. There was no approaching the water by reason of the excessive heat. In <HI>Sorea</HI> the ground sunk in, and discovered a great lake.
<Q><L>A fiery deluge, fed</L>
<L>With ever-burning sulphur, unconsum'd:</L></Q> Which spreading farther and farther, threatening the whole island, terrified the inhabitants so much that they unanimously transported themselves to <HI>Banda,</HI> leaving their moveables behind for want of vessels. All these islands are subject to terrible earth∣quakes, which affect the sea so greatly as particularly to endanger the ships lying at anchor in the fine harbor between this island and <HI>Banda.</HI> I am not certain that <HI>Goenong</HI> is inhabited since the dreadful eruption.</P>
<P><HI>Banda</HI> is defended by a strong castle. The name of the capital is <HI>Nera.</HI> A powerful garrison is kept in this island, it being the seat of government, notwithstanding it is not above twelve leagues in circumference.</P>
<P><HI>Lontoir,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">LONTOIR.</NOTE> the largest of all the group, is inaccessible on most parts, by reason of its lofty precipitous shores; yet the <HI>Dutch</HI>
<PB N="161" REF="168"/>have given it the additional defence of a castle. It has not a tree on it but which bears fruit, and is particularly productive of nutmegs.</P>
<P><HI>Pulo aya,</HI> or <HI>Puloway,</HI> says my old informant <HI>Humphrey Fitzherbert</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Purchas, i. 698.</NOTE>,
<Q>is the Paradise of all the rest, entermitting pleasure with profit. There is not a tree on that island but the nutmeg and other delicate fruits of superfluitie, and withall full of pleasant walkes, so that the whole countrey seemes a contriued orchard with varieties. They haue none but raine water, which the keep in jarres and cisternes, or fetch it frome the above-named islands, which is their only defect. The sea shore is so steepe, that it seemeth Nature meant to reserue this island particularly to herselfe. There is but one place about the whole island for a ship to anchor in, and that so dangerous, that he that letteth fall his anchor sel∣dome seeth the weighing of it again; besides hee incurreth the imminent dangers of his ship.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Poloroon,</HI> or more properly <HI>Poeloron,</HI> is the last.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">POLOROON.</NOTE>. These islands are the antient seats of the nutmegs,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NUTMEGS.</NOTE> as the <HI>Moluccas</HI> were of the cloves. At first they grew spontaneously on most of the neighboring isles, and possibly we shall have occasion to shew, that they spread much farther than is generally known. <HI>Marco Polo</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Bergeron, 135.</NOTE> speaks of the <HI>Noix d'Inde,</HI> and the <HI>des clous de Girosle,</HI> or cloves, as being found on the island of <HI>Necuram;</HI> but where that island stood I am not certain. Originally the <HI>Arabs</HI> engrossed this rich trade, and conveyed the spices up the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Alexandria,</HI> from whence they were
<PB N="162" REF="169"/>dispersed to all parts of southern <HI>Europe.</HI> The general original name of the nutmeg-tree is <HI>Pata.</HI> The <HI>Arabs</HI> called the fruit <HI>Giauz-hant</HI> and <HI>Gjeu-zottibi,</HI> or the <HI>aromatic nut;</HI> it was never mentioned but by the later <HI>Greek</HI> writers, who named it <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and the <HI>Latins, nux moschata;</HI> so that it was not known till long after the clove. We retain the use of them in our dis∣pensatory; they are an agreeable aromatic, and used as astrin∣gents in diarrhaeas and dysenteries: even in <HI>India</HI> they are pre∣scribed in the same disorders. <HI>Gerard</HI> informs us, that in his days they were chewed to correct a bad breath;
<Q>that it is good against freckles in the face, quickeneth the sight, strengthens the belly and feeble liver; it taketh away the swelling in the spleene, stayeth the laske, breaketh winde, and is good against all cold diseases in the body.</Q></P>
<P>IT is often used as an <HI>aphrodisiac,</HI> especially among the <HI>Negroes.</HI> The <HI>Europeans</HI> in <HI>India</HI> apply it as a philtre in cases of love. The eating the raw fruit is often attended with most dangerous consequences; idiotcy, and even phrenzy ensues, and some∣times death. This boasted perfumed air, which salutes the voyager at great distances from land, is pregnant with the most fatal diseases. Few countries are so very unwholesome as the <HI>Spicy Islands.</HI></P>
<P>As soon as the <HI>Dutch</HI> made themselves masters of the <HI>Banda Islands,</HI> they began with extirpating the nutmeg-trees and cloves on all those adjacent, in some by force, in others by employing the natives for hire. Some of the princes of the <HI>Moluccas,</HI> re∣duced by wars, consented to receive pensions for that purpose; the king of <HI>Ternate</HI> had about six thousand pounds a year, and the
<PB N="163" REF="170"/>monarch of <HI>Tidor</HI> about five hundred. This treaty has been twice renewed.</P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>Dutch</HI> first took possession of the islands, they met with some difficulties. The natives were impatient of the yoke, and killed the Governor, <HI>William Verhoeven,</HI> as they could not see the justice of having their nutmeg-woods robbed by strangers, they thought themselves justified in putting to death any thieves they met within their limits; but the Captain General, the great <HI>Koen,</HI> came in force in the year 1621, and put a stop to the evil, by the radical cure of a general massacre.</P>
<P>THE white inhabitants, or rather <HI>Creoles,</HI> and chiefly the out∣casts of the world, or refugees of the most abandoned princi∣ples, often sent here by their relations, so that <HI>Banda</HI> itself is called the house of correction. These are the colonists who re∣peopled the island, and who get slaves from the neighboring places to cultivate the land. Happily the climate is so un∣healthy that very few of these exiles, we may call them, ever return to be a pest to their country or their relations.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>Banda</HI> group, the nutmeg trees are permitted to grow only on that island, <HI>Lontoir,</HI> and <HI>Pulo aya;</HI> the best are those of <HI>Lontoir,</HI> among the lofty and rocky mountains, and on the edges of the precipices, which makes the gathering of the fruit a work of great danger.</P>
<P><HI>Pulo aya</HI> is only two miles long, quite flat, and so destitute of water, either rain or spring, that they are obliged to get it from the neighboring isles, and preserve it in cisterns; yet here grow the loftiest trees, and so productive are they, that the whole
<PB N="164" REF="171"/>world might be supplied from hence.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">GARDENS OF NUTMEGS.</NOTE> The island seems one beautiful garden of nutmeg trees.</P>
<P>THE trees are loaden with fruit the whole year, either ma∣ture or ripening, but it is gathered only at certain times. The principal harvest is in the middle of the rainy season, or in part of <HI>July</HI> and <HI>August,</HI> there is another in <HI>November,</HI> and a third in <HI>March</HI> and <HI>April.</HI> The nuts are carried home and cleansed, and the mace carefully taken off with a knife, and exposed to the sun to be dried. The exterior coat is thick, like that of a walnut; the mace is the immediate covering of the nutmeg, and possesses the same virtues. The oil is a well-known article in our shops.</P>
<P>AFTER some time the nutmegs are divided into three heaps; the first consists of the finest and largest, which are sent to the <HI>European</HI> markets. The next is reserved for that of <HI>India;</HI> and the third, which is composed of the damaged nuts, is never sent abroad, but reserved for the oil which is expressed from them.</P>
<P>THE green or unripe nuts are frequently preserved with sugar, and disposed of in all parts of <HI>India</HI> and <HI>China;</HI> and even some are sent to <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>THERE are, besides the genuine species, six others of the wild kind, called <HI>Palae,</HI> with some distinguishing epithet, and also <HI>Palalae.</HI> After saying that these trees are of little or no use but for the wood, I refer to <HI>Rumphius,</HI> who
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. p. 24. 27.</NOTE> has given descriptions and plates of the several sorts.</P>
<P>THE references to this plant among the best botanical writers are as follows: <HI>Nux myristica femina, Clus. Exot.</HI> 13. 14. <HI>Nux

<P>NUTMEGS are the food of a variety of birds,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">FOOD OF BIRDS.</NOTE> such as Cock∣atoos, different sorts of pigeons, <HI>Jaar vogels,</HI> or the wreathed <HI>Horn-bills, Latham,</HI> i. 358. The pigeons are generally supposed to be the disseminators of these valuable spices, and have been absurdly imagined as the only instruments of their propagation; but the nuts grow equally well by the common method of sow∣ing. The pigeons pull off the external coat, before they devour the nut; the mace is digested, but the kernel passes through them entire; such as falls among the thick grass, is sure to suc∣ceed. By this accident the trees are spread over all the islands, and some which are very distant, so as to elude the utmost dili∣gence of the <HI>Dutch</HI> to effect the total extirpation of the nutmeg.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Columba aenea</HI> of <HI>Linnaeus, Pl. Enl.</HI> 164,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NUTMEG PIGEON.</NOTE> or the <HI>Nutmeg Pigeon</HI> of <HI>Latham,</HI> iv. 636. and <HI>var A.</HI> 637, <HI>Sonnerat,</HI> 168. tab. 102, is the first species. The whole upper part of the body is green glossed with gold and copper. A bird of this kind, perhaps a variety, or perhaps of a different sex, was shot by <HI>John Reinhold Forster</HI> on the island of <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> with two undigested nutmegs in its craw, a proof how remotely this spice may be disseminated; what folly it is therefore in the <HI>Dutch</HI> to endeavour to consine it to the narrow bounds of the <HI>Mollucca</HI> or <HI>Banda</HI> groups, when the very fowls of the air are able to baffle so unjust a mo∣nopoly.</P>
<P>THE next, the <HI>White, Latham,</HI> 638; <HI>Sonnerat. N. Guinée,</HI>
<PB N="166" REF="173"/>169. tab. 105, is wholly of a pure white, except the greater feathers of the wings, and the tail, which are black.</P>
<P>LET me question whether (from its name) the <HI>Aromatic Pigeon, Latham,</HI> iv. 631; <HI>Pl. Enl.</HI> 163, does not feed on these pretious fruits, and contribute likewise to their dispersion.</P>
<P><HI>Amboina</HI> is about 30 leagues to the north-west of the <HI>Banda</HI> isles.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">AMBOINA.</NOTE> This is in respect to cloves, what those are in respect to nutmegs. The <HI>Dutch</HI> have made it the great and sole plantation of that valuable spice. They destroy with the same zeal all that they can find on the islands within their reach, or bribe or compel the natives to do it for them. The governor of <HI>Amboina</HI> makes annually in great state the tour of the islands, with a fleet of perhaps fifty sail of <HI>Corocoros,</HI> the vessels of the country, to enforce obedience, and to shew his power to the people, and the inhabitants of the ten islands dependent on it.</P>
<P>SOME gold dust several years ago was observed to be washed down by the mountain torrents;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">GOLD.</NOTE> it was traced to the source, and the mine discovered. I am not able to give my readers the con∣sequences, nor the present state of the produce. This island has also its volcano. The <HI>Brimstone</HI> mountain called <HI>Wawani,</HI> in 1695 made a dreadful eruption.</P>
<P><HI>Amboina</HI> lies in Lat. 4° 25′ south, and is divided very nearly in two by a long bay, which, with the sea, contracts it into two peninsulas, joined at the eastern end by so very narrow and sandy an isthmus, that small vessels may easily be dragged over. The larger or more northern portion is called <HI>Hitoe,</HI> the other <HI>Ley Timor.</HI> The whole island is full of mountains, covered not only with woods of clove trees, but with the richest productions of
<PB N="167" REF="174"/><HI>Flora;</HI> for variety and singularity of vegetation, no part of the torrid zone can (in even far greater space) vie with it in num∣bers and elegancy. The whole length of the greater portion of this double island, I may call it, is seventy miles. The inter∣vening space of water is a most secure and beautiful meandering bay, with numberless streams falling from the hills, a blessing enjoyed by every side of the island. <HI>Dampier</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyages, iv. p. 184.</NOTE> tells us, that the sea surrounding it is a hundred fathom deep; the bottom sandy and unfit for anchoring, except at the <HI>Ley,</HI> at the west end, where it may be done in twenty fathoms.</P>
<P><HI>Amboina</HI> was discovered by <HI>Antonio d'Abreu</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lonquêtes des Portugais, vol. iii. p. 41.</NOTE>,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">WHEN DIS∣COVERED.</NOTE> about the year 1511. It is said to have been even then peopled with <HI>Malayans,</HI> and possibly some of the <HI>Aborigines,</HI> represented as a most barba∣rous race. Their present religion is <HI>Mahometanism</HI> mixed with <HI>Paganism.</HI> By the wooden print given at p. 10. of the old edition of <HI>Heemskirk</HI>'s Voyage, some of the people had no more than a wrapper round their middle, others were cloathed in long garments, and the military in a shirt and sort of short breeches. Their weapons were spears, scymetars, poisoned darts blown out of tubes, and even matchlocks, as early as the year 1598, which last they probably got from the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> their first masters: their defensive arms were shields, very long and narrow. <HI>Nieu∣hoff</HI> gives a print of an <HI>Amboinese</HI> soldier in the <HI>Dutch</HI> service at <HI>Batavia:</HI> many <HI>Amboinese</HI> are settled there, and are represented as a most dangerous and turbulent people.</P>
<P>THE conquest of <HI>Amboina</HI> by the <HI>Portuguese</HI> arose from this circumstance.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CONQUERED BY THE PORTUGUESE.</NOTE> In 1546 <HI>Galoun,</HI> governor of <HI>Ternate,</HI> had observed great numbers of small vessels resorting from <HI>Java, Macassar,
<PB N="168" REF="175"/>Banda,</HI> and even this island, to the <HI>Moluccas,</HI> for the sake of the cloves. This trade he resolved to suppress; sitted out his fleet; and by his admiral defeated that of the <HI>Indians;</HI> landed, and forced the natives to submit to his will: and in the year 1564 the sovereignty of <HI>Amboina</HI> was vested in the <HI>Portuguese</HI> by the king of the island. <HI>Stephen de Sa</HI> built a fort there in the same year, and his countrymen kept possession till about 1607, when the <HI>Dutch</HI> made themselves masters of <HI>Amboina,</HI> and of all the <HI>Spicy Islands.</HI> The <HI>English</HI> laid in their clame for a share of the com∣merce, and after many disputes, in 1619 a treaty was signed be∣tween the two nations, stipulating that the <HI>Moluccas, Amboina,</HI> and the <HI>Banda</HI> isles should be common to both: that the <HI>English</HI> should have one third of the produce, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> two, at a fixed price, and that each should contribute to the defence of the islands in proportion to the benefit received. The inquisitive reader may find the whole of this curious treaty in <HI>Rymer</HI>'s <HI>Foedera</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. xvii. p. 170.</NOTE>. It has often been remarked, that after a treaty so well calculated to establish lasting peace and harmony between the two companies, nothing could interrupt those blessings. The reverse took place. The <HI>Dutch,</HI> actuated by their insatiable avarice, determined, by the most diabolical means, to free them∣selves from all competitors.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MASSACRE OF THE ENGLISH.</NOTE> They forged a plot of the <HI>English</HI> against their lives and liberties; but such a plot that none but idiots could have been supposed to have projected. The charge was, that ten factors, and eleven foreign soldiers, were to seize on the castle, garrisoned by two hundred men. A foolish ques∣tion asked by an <HI>Indian</HI> soldier, as to the strength of the place,
<PB N="169" REF="176"/>was the foundation of the tragedy. He was seized, and put to the most exquisite tortures that hell itself could invent; and in his agonies answered the artful interrogatories in the manner the Fiscal could wish. Our countrymen, and the eleven foreign soldiers underwent the same horrid torments, which were continued at intervals during eight days. The means are too dreadful for the humane pen to recite, or the humane ear to bear. The constancy of the poor sufferers was often overcome; they made such answers as they thought would soonest free them from the rack, and which they recanted as soon as the torture ceased. They were then recalled to their torments. At length the record of examination was read, and the greater part were relieved by a speedy execution: those who were reprieved could drag but a miserable life, with mangled bodies or dislocated limbs. The sufferers, before death, were confronted with each other, <HI>English</HI> with <HI>Indians:</HI> both be∣wailed their infirmity, for accusing the other under the pressure of torture, and mutually exchanged forgiveness. A full account is given of this horrid transaction by the ingenious <HI>Campbel</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. i. p. 877.</NOTE>, in his collection of travels; we could well excuse his speaking to our eyes by a most horrible print. The foreign soldiers

<P>THE name of the castle, after this cruel deed,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">VICTORIA CASTLE.</NOTE> was changed to <HI>Victoria. Dampier</HI> was shewn the place into which the bodies of our unhappy countrymen were thrown, for the savage <HI>Dutch</HI> did not think them worthy of the rites of burial. The natives who
<PB N="170" REF="177"/>live in the mountains are a brave race of men, disdain a de∣pendent life, and never fail to sacrifice the <HI>Dutch</HI> to their fury, whenever they make their descent from their heights.</P>
<P>BY means of the <HI>Arabs,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CLOVES.</NOTE> the clove was introduced into <HI>Europe</HI> by the common passage over the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Suez;</HI> but before their conquests towards the <HI>Indian Archipelago,</HI> it was carried to the ports of western <HI>Hindoostan,</HI> and from thence, by <HI>Roman</HI> mer∣chant ships, to <HI>Myoshormus,</HI> the great <HI>emporium</HI> on the <HI>Red Sea.</HI> I cannot but think that the clove was early known, and that the <HI>Garyophyllon</HI> of <HI>Pliny</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. xii. c. 7.</NOTE> was the spice which he might truly say, <HI>"tradunt in Indico luco id gigni. Advehitur odoris gratia."</HI> The <HI>Romans</HI> were particularly fond of aromatic perfumes. <HI>Pliny</HI> may not be over accurate in his description; but he is exact in place and property; and the name, except in one letter, agrees entirely with the <HI>Latin</HI> retained to this day.</P>
<P>THE native place of the clove is said by <HI>Rumphius</HI> to have been <HI>Machian,</HI> one of the <HI>Molucca</HI> islands, which we shall have occasion soon to mention. The <HI>Dutch</HI> thought proper to con∣fine the growth of them to <HI>Amboina,</HI> and to extirpate them in every other island in the manner we have related. There are none here growing wild, but all are raised from the seed, and disposed of in plantations. They are also disseminated and pro∣pagated by the pigeons, <HI>Horn-bills,</HI> and <HI>Casuary,</HI> in the same manner as the nutmegs. Of quadrupeds, hogs and deer are found in this island.</P>
<P>No country was ever so happy in a Florist as <HI>Amboina.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">OF RUMPHIUS.</NOTE> The celebrated <HI>George Everard Rumphius,</HI> made it his residence a
<PB N="171" REF="178"/>great number of years. He was born in 1627, and became doctor of physic in the university of <HI>Hanover.</HI> He went over to this island in character of con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l and merchant; and applied his leisure moments to the study of botany; but by the vast fruits of his labors, he must be supposed to have dedicated his whole time to that pursuit. Buy his continual researches after plants, and other objects of natural history on this burning soil, he had, at the age of forty-three, the misfortune of losing his sight. Notwithstanding this he persevered in his pursuits, and being deprived of his visual faculties, acquired that of distinguishing plants by the senses of feeling and smell. He formed a <HI>Hortus Siccus,</HI> in ten folio volumes, and in 1690 dedicated them to the governor and council of the <HI>East India</HI> Company, who deposited it in the <HI>India</HI> house of <HI>Amsterdam;</HI> with them he probably deposited his de∣scription of fishes, and other animals of the island. His bota∣nical labors were not printed during his life; they had the good fortune to fall into the hands of that able naturalist Doctor <HI>John Burman,</HI> who published the first volume of the celebrated <HI>Herbarium Amboinense</HI> in 1740, and completed the whole by the year 1751. It consists of six folio volumes, and an <HI>Auctuarium,</HI> which are illustrated with seven hundred plates, relative to the subject, besides two portraits, one of <HI>Rumphius,</HI> in the sixty-eighth year of his age, in a state of blindness. He is represented feel∣ing the plants and shells, placed before him on a table; the other portrait is of his publisher, Doctor <HI>Burman.</HI> I do not know for certain the time of his death; it probably was at <HI>Amboina,</HI> for he dates the dedication of his <HI>Hortus Siccus,</HI> from the castle of <HI>Victoria,</HI> 1690, in the 63d year of his age.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="179"/>GOVERNOR <HI>Loten</HI> gave a curious anecdote in respect to the fate of his drawings and description of the fishes of the island. There is reason to suppose that they were sent into the world in 1726, in a work published by <HI>Francis Valentyn,</HI> a <HI>Dutch</HI> clergy∣man who had resided in the <HI>Molucca</HI> and <HI>Bonda</HI> islands. Baron <HI>Imhoff,</HI> governor general of the <HI>Indies,</HI> communicated to Mr. <HI>Loten</HI> his suspicions, that <HI>Valentyn</HI> got the materials out of the <HI>India</HI> house by means of his son-in-law, who was first clerk to the secretary of the company; these <HI>Valentyn</HI> basely applied to his own use, not daring to make the acknowlegement; certain it is, they never could be found, notwithstanding the most diligent search has been made after them. <HI>Valentyn</HI>'s work was pub∣lished under the title of <HI>India Orientalis antiqua et nova,</HI> in five volumes folio. The figures of the fishes lie under the impu∣tation of being fictitious, from the extravagancy of their forms; but I am told it is far from being the case, nature having sported wonderfully in the construction of those of the <HI>Amboinese</HI> seas.</P>
<P>THE other works of the great <HI>Rumphius</HI> were the <HI>imagines piscium testaceorum,</HI> first printed at <HI>Leyden</HI> in 1711, and reprinted in 1739: The figures are finely executed. He might have added <HI>crustaceorum,</HI> for there are besides in that work numbers of the lobster and crab kind. No sort of letter-press attends this work, except a catalogue of the subjects, with the names in different languages, especially the <HI>Indian.</HI> From the immensity of his labors, he justly left behind him the title of the <HI>Pliny</HI> of the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>THE west end of <HI>Ceram</HI> is at a very small distance from <HI>Amboina.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CERAM.</NOTE> That island stretches across the channel from east to
<PB N="173" REF="180"/>west, a length of about eighty leagues. <HI>Ceram</HI> and <HI>Buero</HI> divide nearly in two equal parts the <HI>Spicy sea:</HI> this the geographers will find to be a new name, but I think fit to distinguish by that epithet, all the space which comprehends the <HI>Banda</HI> isles, the <HI>Molucca,</HI> the <HI>Papuan,</HI> with <HI>Ceram</HI> and <HI>Buero,</HI> the central isles; bounded on the south by the <HI>Timorian</HI> chain, on the west by <HI>Celebes,</HI> and on the east by <HI>New Guinea.</HI> The inhabitants of its water, of the air, and the vegetation of the islands, are all most singular, which make it merit a title of distinction from all the rest of the <HI>Indian</HI> ocean. The breadth of <HI>Ceram</HI> is inconside∣rable; the land near the sea is low, swampy, and wooded; within, it rises into mountains of great height. It is wonderful how little I can collect concerning this great island; Mr. <HI>Forrest</HI> says that it produced clove trees, possibly in places inaccessible to the <HI>Dutch.</HI> On the authority of <HI>Rumphius</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herb. Amb. i. p. 76.</NOTE>, we may say that there are vast forests of the <HI>Sago tree</HI> on this island; the pith is prepared there into bread, and is exported to other places in great quantities; let me add from <HI>Dampier</HI>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">BUERO.</NOTE> the sea round it is of a vast depth, from whence the shore rises gradually, and surrounds the whole island like a steep wall. The mountains seemingly rise to the very sky, and in some parts are so lofty as to aspire above the clouds, and may sometimes be seen at the distance of twenty-eight leagues. The circumference of <HI>Buero</HI> is about sixty leagues; near the coasts it is extremely well wooded, and productive of most of the tropical trees; a green ebony and an iron wood is mentioned among them. The ground in general is very fertile, but like the other islands much subject to earthquakes.</P>
<P>THE inhabitants are almost black, and both sexes go naked, excepting when a wrapper covers their waists: they were no∣minally subject to the king of <HI>Ternate;</HI> but in 1660 the <HI>Dutch</HI> built a fort, and compelled all the natives to live about the bay of <HI>Keyel,</HI> in fourteen villages neatly built of cane; they also compelled them to cut down and burn the woods, and turn them into fields, gardens, and orchards; before that time they lived in the most wretched hovels. They bemoan their dead relations with great lamentations, but after the corpse is buried, they make great rejoicings; they line the graves with brick, and cover them with clay and stones.</P>

As to those of <HI>New Guinea,</HI> the <HI>Papuan</HI> isles, and the <HI>Moluccas,</HI> I can∣not find sufficient authority for their existence in those places: Mr. <HI>Forrest</HI> never speaks of this singular animal; he gives figures of those of the <HI>Papuan</HI> isles, but not the least intimation of their differing from other hogs. They are made in their bodies like our common hog, and have not the elegant deer-like form given it by <HI>Nieuhoff.</HI> They are sometimes kept tame in the <HI>Indian</HI> isles, live in herds, have a very quick scent, feed on herbs and leaves of trees; never range gardens like other swine; their flesh well tasted. When pursued and driven to extremities, rush into the sea, swim very well, and even dive, and pass thus from isle to isle; in the forest often rest their head, by hooking
<PB N="176" REF="183"/>their upper tusks on some boughs. Their tusks, from their form, useless in fight.</P>
<P>OVER the upper portion of the <HI>Spicy sea</HI> are scattered several islands,

In 1621, before the <HI>Dutch</HI> had determined to fix the seat of cloves at <HI>Amboina,</HI> they had here three factories, and a castle, very difficult of access by sea, placed on one of the rude cliffs which bound the island, and built, after they had dispossessed the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> in 1609.</P>

<P><HI>Tidor</HI> is a fine and fertile island,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TIDOR.</NOTE> and the seat of a monarch. There were violent wars waged between that prince and the king of <HI>Ternate,</HI> which the <HI>Europeans</HI> took advantage of. In the time of <HI>Charles</HI> V. the <HI>Portuguese</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> fought against each other for the possession of these rich spots, and with great animosity; the people of <HI>Ternate</HI> sided with the first, and those of <HI>Tidor</HI> and <HI>Gilolo</HI> with the latter. By the cession of the <HI>Moluccas</HI> to the <HI>Portuguese</HI> by <HI>Charles,</HI> these seas were for a time left in peace. The <HI>Dutch</HI> next arrived, in 1607, and made a fruitless attack on the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> they even suffered a signal defeat, in 1610, off this very island; their admiral, <HI>Willert,</HI> was defeated and slain, and three capital ships taken, by the gallant <HI>Spaniard, Don Juan de Sylva;</HI> but at length, by the assistance of the king of <HI>Ternate,</HI> the <HI>Hollanders</HI> made themselves masters of the fort, and were received by the monarch of <HI>Tidor</HI> in the most friendly manner. The island had been four times most bar∣barously ravaged by the <HI>Portuguese</HI> and <HI>Castilians.</HI> The <HI>Tidorians</HI> naturally considered these new <HI>Europeans</HI> as their deliverers from most inveterate enemies. Here are twenty-five mosques, the chief of which belongs to the sultan. As to his temporalities,
<PB N="183" REF="190"/>he possesses, besides <HI>Tidor,</HI> great part of the south and east of <HI>Gilolo,</HI> and clames the <HI>Papuan</HI> isles of <HI>Waygiou, Mysol,</HI> and <HI>Patenta.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ternate</HI> is the most northern and most important of all the <HI>Moluccas,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TERNATE.</NOTE> yet it is not more than eight leagues in circum∣ference. Dependent on its monarch are the greatest part of the north of <HI>Gilolo,</HI> and of the north-east of <HI>Celebes;</HI> the isle of <HI>Morti,</HI> that of <HI>Batchian</HI> and <HI>Motir;</HI> and several other distant isles, such as <HI>Xula, Bucro, Sanguir,</HI> and <HI>Veranulla,</HI> near <HI>Am∣boina;</HI> he had even part of <HI>New Guinea,</HI> and received a tribute of gold, amber, and <HI>birds of Paradise.</HI> All these, <HI>New Guinea</HI> excepted, contribute their quota of militia. Mr. <HI>Forrest</HI> gives
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 34.</NOTE> a regular list of the number formerly furnished, exactly pro∣portioned to their size or population, as we do at present in the regulation of the militia to be raised in each <HI>British</HI> county; the sum total amounted to 90,700. The naval power was also very considerable, and they and the <HI>Tidorians</HI> have had some well∣contested battles with the <HI>Europeans.</HI> Soon after the arrival of the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> they burnt at once all the forests of cloves; but they speedily revived with as much vigor as ever. The <HI>Portu∣guese</HI> rendered themselves masters of the island, and built a strong fort. The natives thrice abandoned their country; till at length, desperate with the oppressions of strangers, in 1530 they re∣turned in the night, and burnt and destroyed even their own habitations.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Dutch,</HI> on their arrival, were received as deliverers; but the natives soon discovering that the object of every <HI>Eu∣ropean</HI>
<PB N="184" REF="191"/>was the same, they took to arms, and had a long and severe contest for independency. At length the invaders effected by fraud, what might have cost too dear to obtain by violence. In 1638 they wisely entered into a league with the king of <HI>Ternate,</HI> and the lesser princes, as we have before mentioned. This treaty has been twice renewed; but in order to enforce the observance, three strong forts, with suitable garrisons, are established in <HI>Ternate,</HI> and others in the neighboring isles.</P>
<P>THE sultan resides at <HI>Ternate</HI> in great state,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SULTAN.</NOTE> but neither he nor the prince of <HI>Tidor</HI> are better than fettered monarchs. The <HI>Dutch</HI> pay to him all external respect, but at the same time curb him in every commercial attempt. If he fits out a <HI>proa</HI> of any size, the <HI>Dutch</HI> must know the place of its destination; if bound to any distant parts, for cloth or other species of merchandize, they immediately say they are happy that they can supply him with better from their own magazines, and all is at his service; if his Majesty continues obstinate, they send him a present of the finest callicoes, such as they know will be acceptable to his ladies, and add bribes to his favorite females, who generally di∣vert him from his design; if that fails, they always obtain leave to send a trusty officer with the vessel, for the <HI>Dutch</HI> are studious to avoid an open rupture.</P>
<P><HI>Myo</HI> and <HI>Tyfory</HI> are two small isles to the north-east of <HI>Ternate,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MYO AND TYFORY.</NOTE> and subject to its sultan; the first is in Lat. 1° 33′. <HI>Myo</HI> was once inhabited when the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were possessed of the <HI>Mo∣luccas;</HI> but the <HI>Dutch,</HI> to prevent the smuggling of spices, re∣moved the inhabitants. It has on it many goats, is productive of cloves, and possesses a good harbor. In old times these isles fur∣nished
<PB N="185" REF="192"/>their quota of four hundred militia men to the sultan of <HI>Ternate.</HI></P>
<P>THE shipping of the <HI>Molucca</HI> isles consists of a sort of vessels called <HI>Corocoro,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SHIPPING.</NOTE> with a high arched stem and stern like the point of a half moon; the largest are of about ten tons burden. On each side of the vessel are out-riggers or frames made of timber, intersecting each other, and extending like wings far over the water, of different dimensions, according to the size of the <HI>coro∣coro.</HI> The rowers, or rather paddlers, sit in a most singular manner on the intersections of the suspended frames over the water. In a smooth sea they move with vast swiftness. Mr. <HI>Forrest</HI> gives figures of several of these singular vessels
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plates 3. 4. 5. 10.</NOTE>; but the most magnificent is a <HI>corocoro</HI> of <HI>Banda,</HI> represented at p. 13 of the old <HI>Dutch</HI> voyages. Some have banks of rowers, like the <HI>Roman triremes.</HI> M. <HI>de Pages</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Voy. vol. i. p. 169.</NOTE> gives a curious description and figure of one he saw in the <HI>Manilla</HI> isles.</P>
<P>No <HI>Chinese</HI> vessel is allowed to come farther than <HI>Macassar.</HI> The <HI>Sooloos</HI> vessels trade to <HI>Ternate,</HI> but nobody dare send one to <HI>Sooloo;</HI> in a word, the most jealous attention is paid to the pre∣vention of smuggling any of the pretious products of the isles. The <HI>Sooloos</HI> may possibly be the carriers for the <HI>Chinese;</HI> their lading consists chiefly of articles from <HI>China,</HI> and they bring back rice, <HI>suallo,</HI> shark fins, tortoise shells, some small pearls, and abundance of <HI>Loeri</HI> parrots.</P>
<P>THE religion of the island is that of <HI>Mahomet:</HI> here are some mosques, one <HI>Dutch</HI> church, and the ruins of several once be∣longing to the <HI>Portuguese;</HI> but none are permitted to be used;
<PB N="186" REF="193"/>and the people who call themselves <HI>Portuguese,</HI> are now as black as the very natives.</P>
<P>IN respect to the nature of the island, it consists of very high land, abounding with good water, which streams from the clouded peaks. <HI>Ternate,</HI> and every other of the <HI>Moluccas,</HI> have their volcanoes: in 1693 that of <HI>Ternate</HI> burnt in a dreadful man∣ner; stones and other matters are frequently cast out of the cra∣ters, and noises (by the force of fancy compared to the crying of many people) are almost constantly heard within the bowels of the mountains. I think it was at the same time that the moun∣tains <HI>Kemas,</HI> or the <HI>two brothers,</HI> in the district of <HI>Manado,</HI> in the isle of <HI>Celebes,</HI> a part correspondent with <HI>Ternate,</HI> were blown up with a dreadful noise; the sound, like that of thunder, reached <HI>Ternate,</HI> attended with great darkness, and the tremendous con∣vulsions of an earthquake. Through all these chains of islands, even to <HI>Banda,</HI> are possibly chambered galleries, which convey the train from isle to isle, whenever the great Author of Nature directs those awful admonitions.</P>
<P>THE list of the quadrupeds of the <HI>Moluccas</HI> is easily made out:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">QUADRUPEDS.</NOTE> they have goats, deer, and hogs; but the species of deer are unknown to me.</P>

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rumph. ii. 232. tab. 76.</NOTE>, with its elegant coral colored spikes of flowers, are the greatest haunt of these birds. Both contribute to enliven the shores of numbers of the islands. These trees love watery places, and hang waving over the sea. The beautiful birds which inhabit its branches, constitute a valuable article of com∣merce; the natives lying in wait for them, catch numbers by twigs limed with the <HI>viscus</HI> of the <HI>Socci-lacte.</HI></P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">SAGO TREE.</NOTE> in all the <HI>Moluccas,</HI> and other islands of that district, and even in <HI>New Guinea,</HI> grows the <HI>Rima</HI> or <HI>Bread Fruit.</HI> I have before mentioned that useful tree, the <HI>Cycas circinalis, Sago</HI> or <HI>Libby tree,</HI> which appears first in <HI>Siam,</HI> grows in <HI>Sumatra, Borneo, Johor, Java,</HI> and <HI>Mindanao,</HI> is continued through all the islands, and becomes in these countries a vegetable of the first importance, for the subsistence of the inhabitants. It is as wheat to the <HI>Europeans,</HI> mayz to the <HI>Americans,</HI> dates to the <HI>Arabs,</HI> and rice to the <HI>Hindoos.</HI> The use of rice, the great food of <HI>India,</HI> ceases; either the ground is unfit for the cultivation, or the natives are too lazy to sow it, when nature offers them a more ready food. The sago trees grow in great numbers in every one of these islands. It sometimes attains the height of thirty feet, and the branches extend twenty; the circumference of the stem is as much as a man can embrace; the head spreads into leaves like a palm, to which genus it bears a great resemblance; but <HI>Linnaeus</HI> chooses to fling it among the ferns. <HI>Rumphius</HI> (who is very diffuse in his account of it) places it among the palms, under the name of <HI>Sagu,</HI> and <HI>Palma farinaria</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rumphius, i. 72 to 83. tab. 17.</NOTE>; Mr. <HI>Forrest</HI> gives
<PB N="195" REF="202"/>the best account of this most necessary article: I shall therefore borrow from him what is to be said on the subject.</P>
<P><Q>THE sago or libby tree, has, like the cocoa-nut tree, no dis∣tinct bark that peels off, and may be defined a long tube of hard wood, about two inches thick, containing a pulp or pith, mixed with many longitudinal fibres. The tree being felled, it is cut into lengths of about five or six feet; a part of the hard wood is then sliced off, and the workman coming to the pith, cuts across (generally with an adze made of hard wood called a neebong) the longitudinal fibres, and the pith to∣gether, leaving a part at each end uncut, so that, when it is excavated, there remains a trough, into which the pulp is again put, mixed with water, and beat with a piece of wood; then the fibres, separated from the pulp, float at top, and the flour subsides. After being cleared in this manner by several waters, the pulp is put into cylindrical baskets, made of the leaves of the tree; and if it is to be kept some time, those baskets are generally sunk in fresh water.</Q></P>
<P><Q>ONE tree will produce from two to four hundred weight of flour; no wonder then if agriculture be neglected, in a country, where the labour of five men, in felling sago trees, beating the flour, and instantly baking the bread, will main∣tain a hundred. I have often found large species of the sago tree on the sea-shore, drifts from other countries. The sago, thus steeped in the salt water, had always a four disagreeable smell; and in this state, I dare say the wild hogs would not taste it. The leaf of the sago tree makes the best covering for houses of all the palm kind; it will last seven years.
<PB N="196" REF="203"/>Coverings of the <HI>Nipa</HI> or common <HI>Attop,</HI> such as they use on the south-west coast of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> will not last half the time. When sago trees are cut down, fresh ones sprout up from the roots; the wild hogs frequent the places where sago trees have lately been cut down, and the flour or pith has been taken out; they there feast and fatten on the remains.</Q></P>
<P><Q>WE seldom or never see sago in <HI>Europe</HI> but in a granulated state. To bring it into this state from the flour, it must be first moistened, and passed through a sieve into an iron pot (very shallow) held over a fire, which enables it to assume a globular form.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THUS all our grained sago is half baked, and will keep long. The pulp or powder of which this is made, will also keep long, if preserved from the air, but, if exposed, it presently turns sour.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE <HI>Papua</HI> oven for this flour is made of earthen ware;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SAGO OVEN.</NOTE> it is generally nine inches square, and about four deep; it is divided into two equal parts by a partition parallel to its sides; each of those parts is subdivided into eight or nine, about an inch broad (tab. 27.); so the whole contains two rows of cells, about eight or nine in a row. The sago bread, fresh from the oven, eats just like hot rolls. Bread thus baked will keep, I am told, several years; I have kept it twelve months, nor did vermin destroy it in that time.</Q></P>

<P>ON this tree, perhaps more frequent than any palm, is found lodged in the center of the pith the insect called <HI>Curculio Palma∣rium,</HI>

Its <HI>Cossus,</HI> or caterpillar, is esteemed a delicacy among the natives of both <HI>Indies,</HI> as the <HI>Cossi Altiles,</HI> or fatted caterpillars, were among the <HI>Romans. Pliny,</HI> lib. xvii. c. 24, says that the largest and most delicious were those of the oak, which his luxurious country∣men fattened with flour.</P>
<P><HI>Morty,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MORTY.</NOTE> an island that nearly divides the mouth of the long bay at the north of <HI>Gilolo,</HI> rises with great beauty out of the sea; it is particularly noted for the sago trees; is thinly inhabited, but much frequented by parties from <HI>Gilolo,</HI> for the sake of cutting the trees for the pith; the <HI>Dutch,</HI> therefore, to prevent the smuggling of the spices, constantly keep some of the country vessels cruizing between the two islands. <HI>Morty</HI> belongs to <HI>Ter∣nate.</HI></P>
<P>WE now arrive at the <HI>Papuan Islands,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PAPUAN ISLANDS.</NOTE> the group which lies between <HI>Patany Point</HI> and <HI>New Guinea</HI> (they take their name from the land of <HI>Papua,</HI> or <HI>New Guinea),</HI> and as low as the island of <HI>Ceram.</HI> The names of the principal are <HI>Waggiou, Gammon, Patanta, Salwatty,</HI> and <HI>Myxoal,</HI> surrounded by others, small, and of little note, unless by being the places where the adventurous <HI>Forrest</HI> touched in his voyage in search of the nutmeg trees.
<PB N="198" REF="205"/>He had the double hazard of falling into the hands of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> or perishing by the fury of the wild natives; but the first he fortunately escaped; and by his own prudent and conciliating behavior (added to his having a crew entirely <HI>Indian,</HI> excepting two), he sailed not only unmolested, but even befriended, by these apparent barbarians.</P>
<P>THE most western of these islands is <HI>Gibby,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">GIBBY.</NOTE> under the equator, to the south-east of <HI>Patany Hook,</HI> and about six leagues distant. Its length is four or five leagues, its breadth small, and its ap∣pearance like two hills divided by a low isthmus, and full of in∣habitants.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">VISITED BY THE FRENCH.</NOTE> The <HI>French,</HI> actuated by the laudable spirit of im∣proving their colonies by the introduction of nutmeg trees, made more than one voyage for the procuring that valuable spice. The first was in the year 1769, in which the celebrated natu∣ralist M. <HI>Sonnerat,</HI> and the more celebrated philosopher M. <HI>Le Poivre,</HI> embarked and sailed from the isle of <HI>France.</HI> They stu∣diously concealed the names of the islands they visited, and the means they used to accomplish the ends of their mission. M. <HI>Son∣nerat</HI> went a second time, in 1771; has published the account of his voyage, but has given us only a description of the more cu∣rious birds, and of the <HI>Papuans,</HI> the natives of the isles, and of <HI>New Guinea.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> touched at the island of <HI>Gibby,</HI> which they call <HI>Gweby.</HI> During their stay there they were visited by the rajah or prince of <HI>Patany,</HI> the sultan of <HI>Tidor,</HI> and even received an embassy from one whom they stiled the emperor of <HI>Salwatty.</HI> They were most respectfully treated by these poten∣tates; and by the friendship of the prince of <HI>Patany,</HI> obtained the object of the voyage. They carried forty thousand nutmeg
<PB N="199" REF="206"/>trees to the island of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> and others were sent to the isle of <HI>France;</HI> another cargo was sent to the isles of <HI>Sechelles.</HI> If I recollect right, we found on the <HI>Grenades</HI> nutmeg trees, when we took those islands, which had been planted by the <HI>French.</HI> Those which had been transported to the isle of <HI>France</HI> bore fruit, but, I believe, not to that perfection as they do in their native soil.</P>
<P><HI>Gag</HI> is a small uninhabited island, in Lat. 0° 18′ south,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">GAG.</NOTE> but has the advantage of a safe bay, of fresh water, and of timber, which induces people to touch there. <HI>Syang,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SYANG.</NOTE> another little isle north of the line, in Lat. 0° 30′, has also both wood and water; Captain <HI>Forrest</HI> procured the last by observing, that on cut∣ting a tree he calls the <HI>Arrow Plant,</HI> that water distilled from it; he then dug, and found a spring. On a little sandy isle called <HI>Pulo eye</HI> he met with the eggs of the turtle, directed to them by the marks of the sins on the sand.</P>
<P>OTHER small isles, that lie a little to the north and to the south of the line, in about Long. 127° east from <HI>Greenwich,</HI> may be mentioned, to shew the indefatigable industry of our country∣men: such are <HI>Ruib</HI> and <HI>Een,</HI> or fish isle, to the north;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">RUIB.</NOTE> and to the south is <HI>Waglol,</HI> a small flat isle, the residence of a <HI>synagee.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">WAGLOL.</NOTE> or chieftain, of the country, distinguished by having half his coat, and long drawers, clouded with red, white, and yellow; the other half with blue, white, and green; the turband was of white calico, pinked; the clouded part of the dress was <HI>Hin∣doostan</HI> calico, dyed by the natives of the <HI>Moluccas.</HI> Some of these chieftains are men of most polished manners.</P>
<P><HI>Tomoguy,</HI> and the two islands of <HI>Patang</HI> and <HI>Pally,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TOMOGUY.</NOTE> form between them the safe harbor of <HI>Manafuin;</HI> a streight four
<PB N="200" REF="207"/>miles long, with a mud bottom. <HI>Piamis</HI> and <HI>Tamuay</HI> are isles of no note,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SALWATTY.</NOTE> still more south; but <HI>Salwatty,</HI> the most remote of the <HI>Papuas,</HI> and of a considerable size, is divided from the coast of <HI>New Guinea</HI> by the narrow streight of <HI>Galoway.</HI> It is of a lozenge shape, very populous, and governed by a rajah. In 1770 the rajah, with more than a hundred of the <HI>Papuan</HI> boats, from that island, <HI>Arrou,</HI> and <HI>Myxoal,</HI> made the tour of the isles, and sailed up the streights which divide <HI>Gilolo</HI> from <HI>Batchian.</HI> The <HI>Dutch,</HI> apprehensive of some mischief, made their chieftains presents of cloth, &amp;c. Their stay was short, for after fishing and hunting a few days, they dispersed and went home, the rajah excepted, who, with a few of his people, remained behind, without offering the least offence. The <HI>Dutch</HI> treacherously inveigled him to <HI>Ternate,</HI> and even made him a present of a bag of dollars, to be laid out in any of the <HI>European</HI> articles he chose out of their magazines. He entered the fort with a few of his men, and was immediately in∣formed that he was a prisoner. His people instantly gave signs of <HI>running a muck</HI> to save their master, or to sell their own lives dearly. The generous rajah whispered to them an order of for∣bearance, and to endeavor their own escape, which they ef∣fected. The prince gave up his <HI>cris,</HI> and was soon transported to the Cape, to join the miserable exiles on <HI>Robben Island.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Dutch</HI> might have some cause for their fears, it being customary for the <HI>Papuans</HI> of <HI>New Guinea</HI> and <HI>Salwatty</HI> to as∣semble in great numbers in the months of <HI>March</HI> and <HI>April</HI> (when the seas are generally smooth), and make war on <HI>Gilolo, Ceram, Amboina,</HI> and as far as <HI>Aulla Bessi.</HI> In 1765 they plun∣dered
<PB N="201" REF="208"/>the isle of <HI>Amblou,</HI> near <HI>Buero,</HI> and carried away many of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Papuans,</HI> the inhabitants of these isles,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PAPUAN PEOPLE.</NOTE> and of the land of <HI>Papuas,</HI> or <HI>New Guinea,</HI> and (according to Mr. <HI>Forrest,</HI> p. 68.) the internal parts of the <HI>Moluccas,</HI> are a most singular race of men, of a horrible appearance and great ferocity; brave, says M. <HI>Son∣nerat,</HI> lovers of war, cruel, suspicious, and treacherous. Mr. <HI>Forrest</HI> saw them frequently, but his account of them is brief; they behaved to him easy and familiar, and even furnished him with fish, or such provisions their islands afforded. <HI>Forrest</HI> con∣ciliated their affection. It is highly probable that <HI>Sonnerat</HI> re∣ceived his accounts from some <HI>Europeans</HI> who had provoked them by their insults. They live chiefly on fish or turtle, of which they have abundance, and neglect every species of agri∣culture. When they want bread, they carry live turtle, and sausages made of their eggs, dried fish, &amp;c. to the island of <HI>Waggiou,</HI> where they exchange them for <HI>sago,</HI> baked or fresh. Their own isles furnish the trees in quantity; but so lazy are they, that they very seldom will give themselves the trouble of cutting them down. They also bring with them tortoise-shell and <HI>suallo,</HI> which they sell to the <HI>Chinese</HI> whom they find trading in the different islands. Their wives and children accompany them in these voyages, which are performed in boats like those we call punts, square at each end, and furnished with an out-rigger of a single frame; they row with very broad oars. They take with them their bows, arrows, and lances; and for fishing are provided with a small round net, distended at the end of a pole, of the same kind as our <HI>English</HI> landing net. Add to this two or three
<PB N="202" REF="209"/>fox-looking dogs, for the purpose of pursuit by sea or land; for the <HI>Papuans</HI> have a most singular water chase, which is that of hogs;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">WATER CHASE OF HOGS.</NOTE> they follow those animals as they are swimming among the small islands, and shoot them with their arrows, or transfix them with spears. The swine swim in a line, and the hindmost hogs rest their snouts on the backs of the preceding. Mr. <HI>Forrest</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tab. xi.</NOTE> gives us a representation of this kind of hunting, and also of the persons, boats, and the naval apparatus of these sportsmen. They are excellent archers; their arrows are often six feet long; the bow is generally of slit <HI>bamboo,</HI> and the string of split <HI>rattans.</HI></P>
<P>THE aspect of these people is frightful and hideous;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">FORM OF THE PAPUANS.</NOTE> the men are stout in body, their skin of a shining black, rough, and often disfigured with marks like those occasioned by the leprosy; their eyes are very large, their noses flat, mouth from ear to ear, their lips amazingly thick, especially the upper lip; their hair woolly, either a shining black or fiery red: M. <HI>Son∣nerat</HI> imagines the last to be owing to some powder. It is dressed in a vast bush, so as to resemble a mop; some are three feet in circumference, the least two and a half; in this they stick their comb, consisting of four or five diverging teeth, with which they occasionally dress their frizzled locks, to give them a greater bulk; they sometimes ornament them with feathers of the birds of <HI>Paradise;</HI> others add to their deformity by boring their noses, and passing through them rings, pieces of bone, or sticks; and many, by way of ornament, hang round their necks the tusks of boars. The heads of the women are of less size than those of the men, and in their left ear they wear small brass rings.
<PB N="203" REF="210"/>The men go naked, excepting a small wrapper round their waists, made of the fibres of the coco. The women use a covering, in general of the coarse <HI>Surat baftas,</HI> tucked up behind, so as to leave their bodies and thighs exposed to view. The children have no sort of cloathing.</P>
<P>ON an isle in Lat 3° 44′,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">WOMEN.</NOTE> <HI>Schouten</HI> observed that the women were more hideous than the men; their face resembled that of a monkey; their breasts hung down to their middle; their sto∣machs enormously large, and their limbs most disproportionally slender; one squinted; a second had an arm monstrously swelled; a third, a leg; in short, there was not one but had some defect that indicated an unwholesome climate. Such is the account given in
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. i. p. 400.</NOTE> <HI>Les Navigations aux Terres australes.</HI></P>
<P>OFF the north-west part of <HI>Salwatty</HI> is the long isle of <HI>Patanta,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PATANTA.</NOTE> divided from the former by a narrow but long passage, called <HI>Pitt</HI>'s streights; Mr. <HI>Dalrymple</HI> gives views of both of the islands. The land is high on each side, but that of <HI>Patanta</HI> remarkably so; the mountains are double and treble, and rise above each other into most exalted summits, ending in points, or in rounded forms, and quite cloathed with fine woods.</P>
<P><HI>Dampier,</HI> in 1699, sailed between the north side of <HI>Patanta</HI> and the adjacent island, through a streight seen in the maps under the name of the new <HI>Passage; Dampier</HI> mistook the isle of <HI>Patanta</HI> for the extreme north-west part of the <HI>Papuas</HI> land, or <HI>New Guinea,</HI> and passed under cape <HI>Monkaite,</HI> the most westerly point of <HI>Patanta,</HI> which he supposes to have been the cape <HI>Maho</HI> of the <HI>Dutch.</HI> Immediately afterwards he fell in with some small islands,
<PB N="204" REF="211"/>which he named <HI>Cockle</HI> isle,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ISLE OF KING WILLIAM.</NOTE> <HI>Pigeon</HI> isle, and king <HI>William</HI>'s isles Mr. <HI>Dalrymple,</HI> in his view of headlands, gives a point on the last the title of cape <HI>Maho;</HI> that judicious writer makes king <HI>Wil∣liam</HI>'s island the northern boundary of the new streight, or as he names it <HI>Dampier</HI>'s streight; king <HI>William</HI>'s island is very moun∣tanous and woody, and greatly resembling that of <HI>Patanta. Dampier</HI> visited a small low island, off the western part of king <HI>William</HI>'s, which he called <HI>Pigeon</HI> isle, from its swarming with a species of those birds.</P>
<P>THE third he named <HI>Cockle</HI> isle,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">COCKLE ISLE.</NOTE> from the number of the <HI>Chama Gigas</HI> of <HI>Linnaeus,</HI> which he found on the coral rocks. This monstrous shell is described by <HI>Rumphius,</HI> tab. 47. fig. E; <HI>Bonanni, lib.</HI> ii. tab. 88; <HI>Seb.</HI> iii. tab. 86. fig. i; <HI>Argenville,</HI> tab. 23. fig. E; <HI>Born,</HI> p. 80; <HI>Da Costa, Conchyl.</HI> tab. 7. fig. 4; and <HI>Chemnitz,</HI> vol. vii. tab. 9. fig. 495. <HI>Dampier</HI> calls them cockles; he says that at first he could get only small ones of ten pounds weight, but afterwards his men brought him a single shell that weighed two hundred and fifty-eight pounds,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">VAST CHAMAE.</NOTE> so that the pair must have weighed five hundred and sixteen pounds, exclusive of the fish, which in some weighs thirty pounds. This is esteemed very good stewed, and, with the <HI>Sago</HI> bread of these islands, may at any time be a sure relief to navigators. By reason of the size of these shells, it is unsafe to attempt taking them into a small canoe: the method of managing them in such circumstances, is to put a pole into the gaping shell, which instantly closes, and holds so fast that it may be drawn up to the surface of the water; the fish, on being stabbed with a cutlass, dies immediately, and may be taken out, and the shells dropped into the sea. M. <HI>Da Costa</HI>
<PB N="205" REF="212"/>says that sometimes a pair of shells weigh six and even seven hun∣dred pounds. Mr. <HI>Gmelin</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lin. Syst. 3300.</NOTE> relates that the fish is large enough to feed a hundred and twenty men, and that the shells are able to snap a cable in two, or to cut off a man's hand! the last I can credit, possibly the first is an exaggerated proof of their strength.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Born,</HI> p. 81. (from <HI>Davila)</HI> informs us, that from the li∣gament of the hinge is made a gem called <HI>Pavonium</HI> by litho∣logists.</P>
<P>NORTH of <HI>Patanta</HI> is a narrow anonymous isle, lying midway, and at but a small distance from it, that of <HI>Gammon,</HI> situated near to <HI>Waygiou,</HI> one of the greatest of the <HI>Papuan</HI> isles.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">WAYGIOU.</NOTE> On the south this is divided by two great bays, which penetrate deeply into the country; the northern side is gently incurvated, and bends at each end towards the south; the equator passes over the middle of the island. The land is very lofty, and the moun∣tains divide frequently into peaks, the loftiest of which is dis∣tinguished by the name of the <HI>Buffalo's Horn.</HI> The island is faid to be forty leagues in circumference, to be governed by chieftains, and to contain a hundred thousand inhabitants, who are perpetually at war with each other.

<P>THE whole coast continues very lofty, and the land a vast suc∣cession of mountain above mountain, richly cloathed with woods. The little isle of <HI>Yowry,</HI> in Lat. 0° 15′ south, Long. 130° 45′ east,

<PB N="208" REF="215"/>the rest. Numbers of fires were seen, possibly made by the mountaneers.</P>
<P>THE shores were planted with coco palms,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PAPUAN HOUSES.</NOTE> and varied with the grotesque inhabitants, and their singular habitations, built over the water on stages erected on posts, far projecting into the bay, and constructed exactly like some of the stairs on the river <HI>Thames.</HI> A few yards from this is another stage in deeper water, on which stands a small more elevated hut; the first tenement is the largest, and contains fourteen cabins (some are lesser) seven on a side, besides a common hall. In the last the women sit, some making mats, others pots out of the ductile clay, which they afterwards burn with dry grass or brush wood; the women do most of the work; they often are seen with an axe pre∣paring the timber for the stages, while the men indulge in in∣dolence, or preparation for the chase of wild hogs. The mar∣ried people, with their families, live apart from the batchelors in the greater houses; the batchelors in those on the end of the stage; such is said to be the case with the <HI>Battas</HI> on <HI>Sumatra,</HI> and the <HI>Moroots</HI> on <HI>Borneo.</HI> The frontispiece to Mr. <HI>Forrest</HI>'s book gives a full idea of these tenements, and the surrounding scenery, and in tab. 12. is a beautiful view of the entrance, with one of those little round-headed button-shaped islands, covered with wood to the water edge, and which characterise the archi∣pelagos of these parts of the <HI>Indian</HI> seas.</P>
<P>IN the inland part of the country is a race of men called <HI>Haraforas,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">HARAFORAS.</NOTE> who are a sort of gardeners, and cultivate the plan∣tanes, and some other esculents; these they supply the <HI>Papuas</HI> with, by a certain tenure; for if a <HI>Papuan</HI> presents a <HI>Harafora</HI>
<PB N="209" REF="216"/>with an axe or chopping knife, his lands and labor are subject to a tax for ever to the donor. If the <HI>Harafora</HI> loses his axe, he is still subject to the tax; if he breaks or wears it out the <HI>Papuan</HI> must supply him with another, or the tax ceases. The <HI>Haraforas</HI> wear long hair, but are <HI>Pagans</HI> like the <HI>Papuans.</HI> They live in trees, which they ascend by a long notched pole, which they draw after them to prevent surprise.</P>
<P>I CAN give no account of the religious rites of either of these people.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TOMBS.</NOTE> The <HI>Papuans</HI> form tombs of the rude coral rock; Mr. <HI>Forrest</HI> saw one with the wooden figure of a child about eight years old, completely dressed; a real scull, with a wooden head, was placed in the upper part.</P>
<P>THEIR commerce is chiefly with the <HI>Chinese;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">COMMERCE.</NOTE> from them they purchase their iron tools, chopping knives, and axes, blue and red <HI>baftas, China</HI> beads, plates, basons, &amp;c. The <HI>Chinese</HI> carry back <HI>Misory</HI> bark, which they get to the eastward of <HI>Dory,</HI> at a place called <HI>Warmasine</HI> or <HI>Warapine,</HI> it is worth thirty dollars a <HI>pecul</HI> on <HI>Java.</HI> They trade also in slaves, ambergris, <HI>Suallo,</HI> or sea slug, tortoise-shell, small pearls, black <HI>Loeries,</HI> large red <HI>Loeries,</HI> birds of Paradise, and many kinds of dead birds which the <HI>Papuans</HI> have a particular way of drying. As to the <HI>Mi∣sory</HI> bark, the <HI>Chinese</HI> carry it to the island of <HI>Java,</HI> and sell it to the natives, who reduce it to powder, and rub their bodies with it, as the <HI>Gentoos</HI> on the <HI>Coromandel</HI> coast do with the sandal wood.</P>
<P>AFTER this extract, let me observe how very prevalent is the infamous trassic in our fellow creatures, for it reaches possibly to the remotest part of <HI>New Guinea.</HI> The man I mention at p. 34 of
<PB N="210" REF="217"/>this volume, engraven by <HI>Le Brun,</HI> was one of six seized on the coast of <HI>New Guinea</HI> in 1706, by the commander of the <HI>Vink,</HI> a <HI>Dutch</HI> ship, who brought them to <HI>Batavia,</HI> where they were treated with great humanity; it having been the design of the <HI>Dutch</HI> to send them back to their own country, in order to conci∣liate the affections of the natives. The <HI>Papuans</HI> trade in their brother <HI>Papuans,</HI> and carry them to any chance customers they may meet with. Captain <HI>Forrest</HI> met with a boat with only four men, two of which were slaves for sale; each had round his neck a rattan collar, with a log of wood cut into the form of a sugar loaf, and of five or six pound weight, pendant behind. These were offered very cheap to the captain, but he declined the purchase. He seems to have been before provided, for he tells us
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 100.</NOTE> he bought a linguist at <HI>Yowl.</HI></P>
<P>I AM reminded of the ornithology of <HI>New Guinea</HI> and the <HI>Papuan</HI> islands, by the curious birds, which make another article of commerce; nature here grows voluptuously rich in the forms of various of the feathered tribe which wanton in its spicy air.

<P>THIS is the giant of the kind,

They soon grow tame, and take to the food which is placed before them; they are pugnacious, and will strike a hard blow with their wings, which are armed with a horny excrescence. It is said that they are kept in the <HI>East Indies</HI> in the court yards as domestic poultry. They have been brought alive to <HI>France,</HI> where the female has formed its nest in a tree in the Menagery, and laid eggs, but they never produced young.

<P>I WILL conclude this incomplete list by saying, that the cir∣cumambient seas of <HI>New Guinea,</HI> as well as the <HI>Spicy Sea,</HI> have all the pelagic birds of the tropical regions,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PELAGIC BIRDS. TROPIC BIRDS.</NOTE> besides those which wander within them from the north and from the south. Tropic birds are here seen hovering at amazing heights, or darting on the flying fishes, driven out of their element by the pursuit of the <HI>Bonito, Albicore,</HI> and other of their congenial enemies; sometimes resting on the water, or on the backs of the sleeping tortoises, stupidly suffering themselves to be taken by the navigators who happen to pass by. They breed in several places within the <HI>Tropics,</HI> in the <HI>Atlantic</HI> and <HI>Pacific Oceans,</HI> both on the ground, and in trees along with the <HI>frigates,</HI> and in such numbers, that the

<P>THE <HI>frigate</HI> birds appear gliding in the air at times at stu∣pendous heights,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">FRIGATE.</NOTE> and often making the clouds their place of rest, sustaining themselves long motionless on their vast expanse of wing. Then, from a situation so lofty as to render them scarcely visible, will, by virtue of their penetrating eyes, see and dart down on a fish with astonishing rapidity, and with their prey as suddenly regain their former aerial situation. Gulls are often their at∣tendants, and dispute the booty with them.</P>
<P><HI>Petrels</HI> of different kinds are seen skimming the surface;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PETRELS.</NOTE> some are accustomed to snatch the fishes as they pass along; others, collected in multitudes, suddenly dart in concert beneath the water for their food, rise again, and repeat their exercises in long succession.</P>
<P><HI>Pelecans,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PELECANS.</NOTE> and the duller <HI>Corvorants,</HI> keep near to the shores. The <HI>Pelecans</HI> are often seen in the air shifting from place to place; their snowy color, and vast bulk of body, and expanse of wing, render them astonishing objects; they fly, like wild geese, in wedge-shaped phalanxes, and afford a most amusing variety in the animated atmosphere.</P>

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. i. p. 452, 453.</NOTE>; and that appears to have been by the cause, and not by the spout itself, which fell into the sea, near the ship, with a vast noise and agitation of the water: the mizen mast, fore mast, and boltsprit were snapped short off; but this injury arose entirely from the rage of the whirlwind which formed the spout: its first blast blew the ship all along on one side, and almost overset her; then suddenly whirling round with the same fury, very nearly overset her on the contrary side. Sailors are always full of terrors at the appearance of spouts; they discharge cannon into them, in order to break and make them fall at a distance, but never with effect. The experienced <HI>Dampier</HI> concludes with saying, "that the fright was always the greatest harm."</P>
<P>I NOW resume the element of earth. Off the harbor of <HI>Dory</HI> extends the island of <HI>Manaswary;</HI> it is about five miles in com∣pass,
<PB N="222" REF="229"/>and full of trees. Here Captain <HI>Forrest</HI> accomplished the end of his mission; he found on it abundance of nutmeg trees
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 158, 110.</NOTE>, and paid five pieces of <HI>baftas,</HI> his promised reward, to any person who discovered them. The fruit was pendent on the old trees, and the young plants growing under their shade. He took up above a hundred, put them into baskets with earth round them, and then hastened on his return to <HI>Balambangan.</HI></P>
<P>CAPTAIN FORREST finished his voyage at port <HI>Mansingham,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PORT OF MANSINGHAM.</NOTE> at a very small distance from <HI>Dory</HI> harbor. The land from that port recedes deeply to the south, and forms a large bay, gra∣dually narrowing to the bottom. In Mr. <HI>Arrowsmith</HI>'s map the lower part is under the suspicion of being an island; it is marked on each side with double dotted lines, expressive of streights, which opens southerly towards the <HI>Arrou</HI> isles. The promon∣tory of <HI>Dory</HI> and <HI>Geetvinks Point</HI> are the two horns of this bay. <HI>Long Island</HI> lies at a small distance to the north of <HI>Geetvinks Point;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">LONG ISLAND.</NOTE>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SCHOUTENS'.</NOTE> and in Lat. 0° 46′ S. is <HI>Schouten</HI>'s, named in honor of the great circumnavigator who discovered it in 1616. It is about twenty leagues in length, high and fertile, populous, and the inhabitants an active race. The coast extends far to the east. Off it is a succession of small isles, several of them volcanic, and called by <HI>Schouten, Vulcans,</HI> and by <HI>Dampier,</HI> burning isles. <HI>Jamna</HI> and <HI>Moa</HI> are other small islands,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">JAMNA AND MOA</NOTE> well inhabited, and abounding with cocoa nuts and various fruits. Captain <HI>Forrest</HI> gives us two prints representing the natives and their canoes: their hair is flatted on the top of the head; some decorate it with a feather, and others bind a wreath round their temples
<PB N="223" REF="230"/>and head. They wear great ear-rings, and bones stuck through their ears and nostrils. Men women and children go armed with bows and arrows.</P>
<P>AFTER proceeding along the coast farther eastward, the dis∣coveries of our famous navigator <HI>Dampier</HI> thicken on us; an archipelago appears with the <HI>Crown Island,</HI> that of Sir <HI>Robert Rich,</HI> another long island, Sir <HI>George Rooke</HI>'s, and several others,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SIR G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ROOKE</NOTE> many of which were active volcanoes.</P>
<P>IN Lat. 1° 18′ S. <HI>Dampier</HI> discovered a new land to the north, divided from <HI>New Guinea</HI> by a streight from six to seven leagues wide, each side marked by a lofty cape; to one he gave the name of <HI>King William</HI>'s, to that on the north side Cape <HI>Anne,</HI> and within each was a very high mountain, sloping gradually to the sea; the mountains and lower lands finely cloathed with trees, intermixed with beautiful <HI>Savannas</HI> of the most flourishing verdure.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NEW BRITAIN.</NOTE> This northern land he named <HI>New Britain.</HI></P>
<P>WE will follow his track as far as will prove it to be an island, or possibly more than one. Let me observe, that <HI>Dampier</HI>'s approach was the reverse from that which we now take. In Lat. 6° 10′ south, he put into a bay named by him <HI>Port Montagu.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PORT MONTAGU.</NOTE> The country was mountanous, wooded, full of rich vallies and pleasant streams of fresh water. The trees were of various kinds, some in flower, others bore berries, and others large fruits, and cocoa palms in abundance, but the nuts were small; here were also yams, and other good esculent roots, and ginger. The quadrupeds were hogs and dogs; possibly it was from hence that the South Sea isles were stocked with those animals,
<PB N="224" REF="231"/>being the nearest place they could be supplied from. Among the birds were parrots, cockatoos, pigeons, crows, and abun∣dance of other species. There was also fish in plenty. How unfortunate were our convicts, that this rich island was not thought of as the place of their involuntary retreat.</P>
<P>A VERY little to the north of <HI>Montagu Bay</HI> was discovered, in 1767, another streight, of small breadth, but which severs <HI>New Britain</HI> into two islands, leaving the northern the largest. It was not <HI>Dampier</HI>'s fortune to discover it; he passed it by, and, in Lat. 5° 25′ south,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CAPE ORFORD.</NOTE> saw a headland he named Cape <HI>Orford.</HI> The country continued very mountanous, full of people; the men armed with lances, their head gay with feathers; the women had no sort of ornaments, and nothing to hide their nakedness except a bunch of green leaves behind and before. There were tame hogs in great abundance, which ran about near the hovels of the natives.</P>
<P>WITHIN cape <HI>Orford</HI> was an inlet, which <HI>Dampier</HI> supposing to be a great bay, named by him that of <HI>St. George,</HI> and a cape on the northern side, in Lat. 5° south, Long. 152° 19′ east, corre∣spondent to cape <HI>Orford,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CAPE ST. GEORGE.</NOTE> he called cape <HI>St. George.</HI> These two headlands proved the distinguishing mark of the entrance into a streight, which divided <HI>New Britain</HI> into a second island. This discovery was made by that able officer Captain <HI>Carteret, Sep∣tember</HI> 9th 1767, on his disastrous return from the South Seas. When he got into <HI>St. George</HI>'s bay, he found so strong a current to the north-west, that he could not return to pursue <HI>Dampier</HI>'s track. Captain <HI>Carteret,</HI> soon after he doubled cape <HI>St. George,</HI> met with several islands in the southern side of the streights;
<PB N="225" REF="232"/>the nearest, about three leagues from the cape, he named <HI>Wallis</HI>'s, which lay before an harbor he called <HI>Gower</HI>'s.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">WALLIS'S ISLE.</NOTE> The island was lofty, well wooded, and inhabited; farther on were two coves, with fresh water rivers falling into their bottom. About four leagues from <HI>Wallis</HI>'s isle, still to the west, was a good harbor, on which was bestowed the respectable name of the dis∣coverer; across it lay <HI>Cocoa-nut</HI> isle. On this coast were trees of enormous growth, all the kinds of palms, the betel tree, aloes, bamboos, rattans, a fruit the sailors call a <HI>Jamaica</HI> plumb, and probably many of the tropical fruits and plants; he also found the nutmeg tree in plenty; possibly this place is its most remote situation to the north.</P>
<P>THE country abounded with land birds, seemingly the same with those of <HI>New Britain;</HI> among them was a large black bird, that made a noise like the barking of a dog, which I suppose to have been a <HI>Buceros.</HI></P>
<P>MR. <HI>Carteret</HI> pursued his own discovery, and sailed directly westward.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NEW IRELAND.</NOTE> He gave the name of <HI>New Ireland</HI> to the island on the northern side, and distinguished three capes on the southern by the names of <HI>Buller, Palliser,</HI> and <HI>Stephens.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CAPE STEPHENS.</NOTE> Between cape <HI>Palliser</HI> and cape <HI>Stephens,</HI> is an island, to which Mr. <HI>Carteret</HI> gave the name of the Duke of <HI>York</HI>'s, quite level, deliciously cloathed with lofty woods in the inland parts, and near the shore planted with cocoa groves, intermixed with the houses of the islanders.</P>
<P>TO the east of cape <HI>Stephens,</HI> is in mid-channel an isle he called the isle of <HI>Man.</HI> Cape <HI>Stephens</HI> is the supposed most ex∣treme western point of <HI>New Britain;</HI> all that side, as far as cape
<PB N="226" REF="233"/><HI>Gloucester,</HI> still remains undiscovered. A little to the south of cape <HI>Stephens</HI> are three singular hills, the <HI>Mother</HI> and <HI>Daugh∣ters,</HI> and behind them a vast volume of smoke arose, out of one of the numerous volcanic hills of the country. The land, like the rest of <HI>New Britain,</HI> was very lofty and wooded, with many clear spots, the signs of plantations, and frequent fires, the marks of inhabitants. The general breadth of these streights are about fifteen leagues
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hawksworth, iii. 596.</NOTE>; no bottom was found with a line of a hundred and forty fathoms. Captain <HI>Carteret</HI> modestly declined giving his own name to this important discovery, but called it <HI>St. George</HI>'s channel;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ST. GEORGE'S CHANNEL.</NOTE> the streights properly end at cape <HI>Ste∣phens.</HI> As soon as that promontory is passed, there is one ex∣panse of sea, probably quite to <HI>New Guinea,</HI> but the name of <HI>St. George</HI>'s channel is continued along the shores of <HI>New Ireland,</HI> to its western extremity, where it is broken into a smaller isle, named by our navigator <HI>Hanover,</HI> and the extreme point, in Lat. 2° 29′ south, Long. 148° 27′ east, queen <HI>Charlotte</HI>'s foreland; the approach to it is through a narrow passage, between an isle called <HI>Sandwich,</HI> and <HI>New Ireland.</HI> The land of <HI>Hanover</HI> isle is high, finely covered with trees, mixed with plantations, exhi∣biting a most beautiful landscape.</P>
<P>THE whole length of <HI>St. George</HI>'s channel,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">LENGTH OF.</NOTE> from cape <HI>St. George</HI> to queen <HI>Charlotte</HI>'s foreland, is three hundred miles; that of <HI>New Ireland,</HI> from cape <HI>St. George</HI> to cape <HI>Biron,</HI> the western extremity, is two hundred and forty miles; cape <HI>Biron</HI> is possibly the same with that we see in <HI>Dampier</HI>'s map under the name of cape <HI>Solomaswar.</HI> As to the form of <HI>New Ireland,</HI>
<PB N="227" REF="234"/>it is extremely narrow the whole way; the greatest part runs north-west, but towards the east end, reverts and bends like a hook to the south, terminating in cape <HI>St. George.</HI></P>
<P>BEYOND these was a group of small isles Mr. <HI>Carteret</HI> named the <HI>Admiralty,</HI> in Lat. 2° 18′ south, Long. 146° 44′ east. By the views of them they appear less elevated than <HI>Hanover</HI> isle, and we may collect, from the multitudes of canoes that sallied out to attack our commander, that they must be very populous; they were manned with people nearly black, with woolly heads. The natives were very hostile,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NATIVES.</NOTE> and flung with great force lances headed with flint; they chewed betel, went quite naked, but their bodies were ornamented with shells, their faces streaked with white, and their heads as finely powdered with white powder as an <HI>English</HI> beau ready for a <HI>Bal parè.</HI> One of their canoes, apparently the least, was taken, yet it mea∣sured full fifty feet in length. In it were specimens of their arts, such as earthen pots, in which they dressed their victuals, and a quantity of matting which served for sails and awnings; there were besides cocoa nuts, and other fruits unknown to our people.</P>
<P>SOME of the canoes of <HI>New Ireland</HI> were ninety feet long,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CANOES.</NOTE> formed out of a single tree; a proof of the vigorous growth of timber in this country; they were manned by three and thirty men, black and woolly headed, but they had not the thick lip or flat nose; in ornaments and powdering they resembled the for∣mer; some had cock's feathers in their heads, a proof that they did not want poultry. They had lances by way of arms, and cord∣age and fishing nets very skilfully manufactured; all this coun∣try
<PB N="228" REF="235"/>is probably well inhabited, and very fertile in trees and fruits; the sea abounding in turtle and fish. The very distressed state of Captain <HI>Carteret</HI> and his crew, is the sad but true apo∣logy for our wanting, from his able pen, a fuller account of this interesting island.</P>
<P>ON <HI>July</HI> 5th 1768, M. <HI>Bougainville</HI> anchored in the same bay as Captain <HI>Carteret</HI> did, and named it <HI>Port Praslin.</HI> He observed here the pepper plant, and found wild hogs, numbers of birds, and among others the great crowned pigeon; variety of snakes, scorpions, and the singular insect the walking leaf.</P>
<P>AMONG the serpents was the sea snake, of that species which, at p. 131, is suspected to have been poisonous; this was verified here. A sailor was bitten as he was hawling the <HI>Seine,</HI> he was very soon affected with violent pains all over his body; his side (the part on which he received the wound) became livid, and swelled greatly, the blood taken from him appeared dissolved: he suffered much for five or six hours; at length, by the assistance of the <HI>Venice</HI> treacle, or <HI>Theriaca Andromachi,</HI> with <HI>flower de luce</HI> water, he fell into a violent perspiration, and was quite cured
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bougainville's Voyage, translation, p. 334.</NOTE>. The natives of <HI>Otaheite</HI> assert that the bite is mortal.</P>
<P><HI>Dampier</HI> coasted the whole northern side. Captain <HI>Carteret,</HI> in his approach to the eastern end, fell in with a group of little isles, to which he gave the name of the <HI>nine isles.</HI> He passed between two larger, the more southern he called Lord <HI>Anson</HI>'s; the more northern, Sir <HI>Charles Hardy</HI>'s, in Lat. 4° 50′ south, was flat, verdant, and appeared well inhabited. He soon after saw St. <HI>John</HI>'s isle,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ST. JOHN's ISLAND, &amp;c.</NOTE> discovered by <HI>Schouten,</HI> and seen by <HI>Dampier.</HI>
<PB N="229" REF="236"/>It is nine or ten leagues round, rises into high hummocks full of lofty trees, with plantations and groves near the shores, and seemingly very populous. We now fall in with <HI>Dampier,</HI> with cape St. <HI>Mary's,</HI> in Lat. 5° 2′ south. The country was mounta∣nous, high, and wooded, with many points of land running into the sea, forming between them as many fine bays. Here a man of large size approached the ship, and spoke a language different from those <HI>Dampier</HI> had before seen. Proceeding north-west∣ward, the whole extent of <HI>New Ireland,</HI> or the coast opposite to St. <HI>George</HI>'s channel (afterwards traced by Captain <HI>Carteret</HI>) ap∣pears before us. At some distance from it is a chain of isles, of which St. <HI>John</HI>'s may be deemed one. They had been all named by the <HI>Dutch. Antony Cave</HI>'s is lofty.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">GERARD DENNIS's.</NOTE> <HI>Gerard Dennis</HI>'s is the next, fourteen or fifteen leagues in circumference; high, wooded, and mountanous, thick set with plantations, and full of cocoa trees. The shape was irregular, full of points, forming sandy bays; the ground cleared for plantations, and the soil of a brownish red color. The next island, named <HI>Wishart</HI>'s,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">WISHART'S.</NOTE> resembled the preceding. <HI>Dampier</HI> also discovered two other islands some∣what farther to the west: One, ten leagues long, he named <HI>Ma∣thias;</HI> like many others, mountanous and woody, mixed with <HI>Savannas,</HI> and cleared land; and near that a low and plain island, cloathed with tall and large trees, as close to each other as they could stand. This he called the <HI>squally,</HI> from the violent gales he met with off the coast.</P>
<P>IN respect to the north shore of <HI>New Ireland,</HI> I find that our navigator attempted to touch at only one place, which he named <HI>Slinger</HI>'s bay. This country seems prodigiously populous;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SLINGER'S BAY.</NOTE> his
<PB N="230" REF="237"/>ship was surrounded with prows filled with men, who assaulted him with stones flung out of engines; and the shores were lined with the natives from end to end.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NATIVES.</NOTE> All the inhabitants of this, and the adjacent isles, were a warlike race, hostile to strangers, and very suspicious. They were tall, even above the size of the common race of men, strong, and well made, had curled short hair, often shaved in different forms, and stained with white, red, and yellow; their heads were round faces broad; they had great bottle noses, and substances stuck through the gristle, passing from cheek to cheek. Their weapons were lances, swords, slings, and bows and arrows; their speech clear and dis∣tinct. All these are the same kind of people, from the remotest of the <HI>Papuan</HI> isles to this island; varying a little in the dressing of their hair, and other trifling matters.</P>
<P>THEIR prows were very neatly built,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PROWS.</NOTE> with out-riggers on one side; the head and stern elevated, and most ingeniously carved with figures of fish, fowl, and on one was a man's head, done most surprisingly well, considering the rude in∣struments of stone they had to work with; for they seemed ignorant of the uses of iron; their paddles were very neat; and they made their way with amazing swiftness through the water.</P>
<P>A VERY legendary tale is told, in <HI>L'Histoire de Navigations aux Terres Australes</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 434.</NOTE>, respecting the origin of the <HI>Negro</HI> race in these <HI>Asiatic</HI> isles, which is first met with in some of the <HI>Manillas,</HI> continued through the <HI>Papuan</HI> isles and <HI>New Guinea,</HI> and even through <HI>New Holland.</HI> I have mentioned them before in my
<PB N="231" REF="238"/>account of the <HI>Manillas,</HI> and if I recollect right, one of these islands is called the isle of <HI>Negroes,</HI> from its being inhabited by a curled headed people.</P>
<P>I NOW return from cape <HI>Biron,</HI> or <HI>Solomaswar,</HI> taking a course due south, along the western coasts of the isles of <HI>New Britain.</HI> Near the extreme western part of the farthest is an headland, called by <HI>Dampier, Cape Gloucester.</HI> At a small distance to the west is a little island, which at the time our navigator passed it, was a raging volcano. It flung up columns of flame twenty or thirty yards high, attended with a noise like thunder, followed by an overflowing of red-hot lava, which ran down the sides of the mountain till it reached the sea. This continued two days and nights, or as long as this tremendous phaeno∣menon continued in sight.</P>
<P>I NOW repass <HI>Dampier</HI>'s streights eastward, and turn to the south. In Mr. <HI>Arrowsmith</HI>'s excellent map of the world, <HI>New Guinea</HI> is continued by dotted lines, farther to the east; and on the south side, near the extremity of that line, the uncertainty is taken away by a tract of land discovered by M. <HI>de Bougainville</HI> in 1768, which he named <HI>La Louisiade,</HI> and the extreme eastern point <HI>Le Cap de la Deliverance,</HI> in memory of his narrow escape from a violent tempest. The great bay which he calls <HI>Le Golfe de la Louisiade</HI> is just to the south of the cape. Such a confusion, occasioned by the fears and distresses of the great <HI>French</HI> navigator, is so apparent in this part of his voyage, that nothing more can be collected respecting this portion of <HI>New Guinea.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="239"/>WE must therefore steer along another dotted line till we arrive at <HI>Prince of Wales</HI>'s islands,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PRINCE OF WALES'S ISLES.</NOTE> Lat. 10° 33′ south, Long. 142° east. The largest is long and narrow, and lies parallel with the coast. This part of the sea between <HI>New Guinea</HI> and <HI>New Hol∣land</HI> is called <HI>Torres</HI>'s streights,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TORRES'S STREIGHTS.</NOTE> for having been passed in 1606 by <HI>Don Baes de Torres,</HI> admiral under <HI>Fernandez Quiros;</HI> corre∣spondent to them, beyond another set of islands, named also the <HI>Prince of Wales</HI>'s, is the <HI>Endeavour</HI> streight, passed, as I have before mentioned, by our boasted <HI>Cook.</HI></P>
<P>IN proceeding along the coasts, I find names of places, but nothing more. Captain <HI>Cook,</HI> on his quitting the coast of <HI>New Holland,</HI> crossed the intervening water, and touched in Lat. 6° 15′ at a place on this side of <HI>New Guinea,</HI> to which he has neither left a name, nor yet even the mark of landing in his chart. We are told that it lay sixty-five leagues to the north-east of <HI>Waelche</HI> cape. The country was low, but covered with such a luxuriancy of wood and herbage as scarcely can be conceived; and among them such numbers of aromatic trees, as perfumed the air even at a distance from shore. The natives were hostile, went quite naked, and had much the appearance of the <HI>New Hollanders.</HI> They shouted defiance, and from a short stick or hollow cane they swung in their hands,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">FIRE-ARMS.</NOTE> was emitted flashes of fire, exactly like the effect of gunpowder; these explosions were innocent, nor could our navigators ever learn the cause. After each explo∣sion, which was done by a single man, his companions flung their bearded darts. All that we learn farther of this country is, that it produced sine cocoa-nuts, plantanes, and bread fruit.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="240"/>CAPE <HI>Waelche</HI> or <HI>Walsh,</HI> the most western point of this coast,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CAPE WAELCHE.</NOTE> lies in Lat. 8° 32′ south, Long. 137° east. From hence the land runs strait, inclining to the north-east, when it takes another turn towards the north-west. The space between the trendings is occupied by the tract, marked in Mr. <HI>Arrowsmith</HI>'s map as pervious by two streights. The <HI>Arrou</HI> isles lie trans∣verse, at some distance from this part of <HI>New Guinea.</HI></P>
<P>FARTHER to the north-west, nearly parallel to the end of <HI>Ceram,</HI> is <HI>Freshwater</HI> bay, in Lat. 1° 33′ south. This was visited by <HI>Dampier</HI> in 1699. The country was wooded and mounta∣nous, like the other parts of <HI>New Guinea,</HI> and the trees of great size; here his people killed one of those magnificent pigeons called the <HI>crowned.</HI> The bay received its name from the plenty of fresh water; and another, a little farther north, was called <HI>Mackerel</HI> bay, from the great quantity of that fish,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MACKEREL BAY.</NOTE> or one resem∣bling it, which was taken there.</P>
<P>OPPOSITE to this bay, in Lat. 2° 43′ south, is <HI>Pulo Sabuda,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PULO SABUDA.</NOTE> a lofty island, about three leagues long and two broad, not far from the coast of <HI>New Guinea;</HI> it is in general rocky, but so mixed with rich yellow and black soil, as to be productive of many of the tropical fruits and trees. The sago tree and the <HI>Jacca</HI> are found there. The natives gave <HI>Dampier</HI> two or three nutmegs, seemingly fresh gathered; but he could not tell whe∣ther they were the produce of the isle or of <HI>New Guinea.</HI> The inhabitants do not seem to be aboriginal. They are tawny, have long black hair, and differ little from the <HI>Mindanayans,</HI> and the people of the other eastern isles; the women wear a callico co∣vering;
<PB N="234" REF="241"/>the men go almost naked, and are very skilful in striking fish; they have great boats in which they often visit <HI>New Guinea,</HI> where they procure slaves, beautiful parrots, &amp;c. which they carry to <HI>Goram,</HI> and exchange for callicoes. They keep many of the poor <HI>Papuans</HI> for their own use to do the laborious work. This island has the same birds as the main land, and bats of an enormous size.</P>
<P>I CANNOT quit this part of the coast without mentioning a singular communication made to Captain <HI>Forrest</HI> (p. 149.) by the natives of <HI>Ess-be</HI> in the island of <HI>Mixoal,</HI> that on the coast of <HI>New Guinca,</HI> not far from a gulph about a day's sail from <HI>Wanim</HI> or <HI>Onin,</HI> a place about twenty leagues from the north∣east of the isle of <HI>Goram,</HI> was a set of people who wore large turbans. He imagines them to have been the posterity of a colony of <HI>Arabs.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ARABS.</NOTE> If this is true, their discovery will be just as important to the world as that of the race of <HI>Owen Gwynedd,</HI> long lost to the <HI>Britons,</HI> till it has been lately credited that they still exist in <HI>America,</HI> under the title of <HI>Padoucas</HI> or <HI>Welsh In∣dians.</HI></P>
<P>THAT the western side of <HI>New Guinea</HI> (probably all parts,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PLENTY OF NUTMEGS.</NOTE> if properly examined) abound with nutmeg trees, is very certain. A <HI>Portuguese</HI> ship, which was forced by a storm from its anchor∣age at <HI>Timor,</HI> was driven to this coast, and there anchored in order to repair the damage she had received. The captain, during the interval, procured a sufficient loading of nutmegs, with which he sailed directly to <HI>Macao,</HI> and sold them, without ever return∣ing to his former place of destination.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="242"/>FROM <HI>Mackerel</HI> bay, the coast trends to the north-west as far as the streights of <HI>Galowa</HI> and <HI>Salwatty</HI> island. From thence it turns to the north-east, terminating at the Cape of <HI>Good Hope.</HI> Thus have I performed the circuit of the great island, and con∣cluded this the last great labor of my life.</P>

<Q>This species grows in the warmer parts of <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI> and also in <HI>India</HI> and <HI>China,</HI> and is much used for walking sticks and fishing rods. This is a fragile staff, and the only cane in use that has that property. Upon an accidental bruise it will break in shivers. It is the Kaneh of the Hebrews; and from its brittle quality we see the propriety of Rabshakah's allusion, 2 Kings, xviii. 21. <Q>Now behold thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed (kaneh), even upon Egypt, on which if a man lean, it will go into his hand and pierce it; so is Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all that trust on him.</Q> The Hebrew word having been introduced not only into the Greek and Latin, but most of the modern languages of Europe. The Spaniards call it Cannas, and the Italians Canna. It gave the name of Cane to all the sticks which resembled it, when they were first imported by the Dutch, &amp;c. from the East Indies.</Q></ITEM>
