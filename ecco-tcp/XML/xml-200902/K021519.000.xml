<P>THE SIEGE of GIBRALTAR: A MUSICAL FARCE, IN TWO ACTS As it is performed at the THEATRE ROYAL, IN COVENT-GARDEN.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE very favourite Song of, "How stands the glass around, my boys?" is so pecu∣liarly adapted to the situation in which it is in∣troduced, that the Author hopes he will not be censured for the sacrifice he has made of origi∣nality in adopting it. It is moreover written in a spirit and taste which is much easier to admire than equal. As to the rest of the songs, they are all his own; and he fears he must trust more to the indulgence of the public in regard to them, than to any thing he can say, or has written in their favour.</P>

<P>Dear Major, will you indulge me with a moment's conversation?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. Broom.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's the matter, Frank?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beauc.</SPEAKER>
<P>You were my father's friend; he put me under your care when I came into the army, and I have ever looked up to you as to himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. Broom.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is very true, but what does it preface?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beauc.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know my passion for old Ben Hassan's daughter; indeed you approved of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. Brom.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is this a time to think of such sol∣lies? just when you are going to action! Recollect yourself, boy, you are a soldier, your father was one; dishonour never changed his cheek, and don't you bring a blush there in his old age.</P>

<P>Your reproach stings me to the very soul; I have done with her, I'll tear her from my heart for ever.</P>

<P>Your hand, Frank; now you are a man again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beauc.</SPEAKER>
<P>But give me leave to do away the very shadow of cause for this degrading notion being enter∣tained of my nature. I meant only to have told you, that the lovely woman in whom my whole life and happiness are wrapped up, is this very night to be conveyed privately to Barbary, in order to be married to Solomon the Jew, whom you have often seen at her father's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. Broom.</SPEAKER>
<P>But are you sure of this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beauc.</SPEAKER>
<P>An Arabian slave, in whom she places great confidence, told me of it; but it is no matter, you have convinced me of the impropriety of my passion, and I resign her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. Broom.</SPEAKER>
<P>She's a devilish fine woman, Frank.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beauc.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have drove her from my thoughts, sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. Broom.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, Frank, you shan't lose her neither, if in my power to prevent it. Let me see; <STAGE>(looks at his watch)</STAGE> I'll give you an hour; go see her, and learn the time, and in what manner she and her Hebrew partner set off.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beauc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear sir, are you serious?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. Brom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Unless we silence the Spanish batte∣ries, the old Moor will hardly venture his daughter out this night. If we should, you shall patrole the very hour they are going off, and stop her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beauc.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, sir, can I be so long absent from my post, without injury to my reputation?</P>

<P>Not at all; he purchased me at Cairo from an Arabian merchant when I was but four years old. I never saw the father who begat me, nor the mother who brought me into the world. He knows I have no brother, no sister, no tie of kindred upon earth, to make my affections wander from this spot. He thinks I look up to him as my only relation, but my attachment to my dear mistress, united to the natural passion of man for liberty, which only with life leaves us, makes me do a violence to my nature, and for the first time deceive him.</P>

<SPEAKER>Muley.</SPEAKER>
<P>By the meerest accident in the world: you must know, sir (for I never knew it 'till my brother here told me of it) that I was stolen from my parents, at two months old, by a Gypsey, who sold me, at Cairo, to the merchant of whom you bought me; my father, who loved his children dearer than his life, had six sons besides myself— <STAGE>(looks at Beauclere)</STAGE> seven! I beg your pardon, my father, sir, had seven sons beside myself.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Muley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear sir, let me go on with my story, and you shall know all by-and-by: my father, sir, who had seven sons besides myself, and loved his chil∣dren dearer than his life, left it, upon his death bed, that a third of the estate, together with the family pictures—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ben.</SPEAKER>
<P>Family pictures!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Muley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, sir, (which were very valuable) should go to whoever found his lost sheep; for you must know, sir, he used always to call me his lost sheep.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ben.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your sleece, Mr. Lost Sheep, is in great danger of a good threshing, I can tell you that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Muley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fortunately, sir, this brother, whose name is Sinbad, after numberless perils and hardships, put up at the very inn at which you lodged at Cairo; the landlord, who had heard of the misfortunes of my
<PB N="14" REF="19"/>
family, introduced him to the merchant of whom you bought me; the merchant kindly introduced him to your broker, and the good-natured broker never rested, night or day, 'till he actually found out the identical ship and captain in which, sir, you sailed with me from Cairo; on board this, sir, he embarked about a fortnight since; and, after a short passage, arrived at Algiers in Barbary, from which place he came, last night, with a fresh supply of cabbages, live oxen, and fat turkies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Such a cargo of lies, I believe, never were jumbled together in so small a compass: why, you dog, I'll have you impaled alive for bringing a male into my house.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ben.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, nothing.</P>

<P>He says that, in his travels through the different parts of the globe, he never met a gentleman

<P>As a soldier and an Englishman, you may suppose me anxious for the honour of my country; answer me, sir, at once, if we are victors, why does that Spanish ensign insult the flag of my country?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sail.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, if I may speak, your honour, before my superiors, it's a kind of dulgence we shewed them; for the Spanish Monsieurs fought damn'd well this bout; and then you know a man has some pleasure in beating 'em.</P>

<P>What is our advantage, sir?</P>

<P>Vantage! why we have taken five, sunk two, and blown up one; that's all. It's a great pity there were not a few more to give a good account of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. Brom.</SPEAKER>
<P>I request, sir, you would go instantly with your dispatches to the Governor: this is a piece of intelligence which once more dispels the gloom from Gibraltar. Let the whole garrison salute the fleet, for the strength and bulwark of England at all times has proved her navy.</P>

<P>By my shoul, your honour, if I may speak without offence, the devil a word of lie in what you say; for the firmest ground an Englishman ever stood upon is the ocean.</P>
