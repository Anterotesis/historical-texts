<PB REF="4"/>
<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>A Work which is in the world, under the title of the PUPIL OF PLEASURE, exemplified that part of a <HI>late celebrated system,</HI> which led im∣mediately to voluptuousness, hypo∣crisy, and seduction. It was, there∣fore, a faint mark for literary ridi∣cule. The peculiar success of my
<PB N="ii" REF="5"/>undertaking, and the general esteem it still maintains, (notwithstanding the wilful, or the ignorant, perver∣sions of a few individuals, who af∣fected to have their scruples concern∣ing the character of <HI>Sedley)</HI> con∣vince me, that I did not write in vain.</P>
<P>But, methinks, something very essential yet remains to be done. There is a much <HI>better,</HI> as well as a much more <HI>brilliant, system</HI> still to be illustrated; the system of inte∣grity and TRUTH.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="6"/>
This is attempted in the <HI>present</HI> performance, where the reader will see, in contrast to the <HI>Pupil of Plea∣sure,</HI> a character of a very different colouring figure before him. One, who, though even more accomplished than SEDLEY, with all his fire, spirit and opportunity, as well as every per∣sonal advantage, employs each in the cause, not of ruin, but <HI>since∣rity.</HI></P>
<P>It has been endeavoured also, that the scenes, in which this new per∣sonage is engaged, should be so dis∣posed, as to give full scope for all that is just, affecting and ennobled,
<PB N="iv" REF="7"/>without departing from human na∣ture. The Hero of <HI>this</HI> production, like that of the <HI>other,</HI> hath many struggles, and many anxieties; for virtue (with respect to <HI>ordinary</HI> suc∣cesses and rewards) is not always for∣tunate: but between the two heroes there is, throughout their adventures, this distinguishing difference; the one hath the pangs of <HI>remorse</HI> superadded to those of shame and despair; and the sufferings of the other, like the agonies of a Messiah, are always for the truth, and for the happiness of others. All that the best men in the world can say to themselves
<PB N="v" REF="8"/>is comprized in this couplet of the poet.</P>
<Q><L>'Tis not in mortals to <HI>command</HI> success,</L>
<L>But we'll do <HI>more,</HI> Sempronius, we'll <HI>deserve</HI> it.</L></Q>
<P>There have been those (whether in the spirit of criticism, or from prin∣ciple, I cannot tell) who have warned the young and sober against the <HI>warmth of character</HI> in the <HI>Pupil of Pleasure:</HI> surely, a little thinking might reconcile to <HI>them,</HI> (as to the rest of the world) the propriety of painting vice in strong colours, in order to bring it into contempt. That very SEDLEY, who sets out, with all the graces of <HI>Chesterfield</HI> in
<PB N="iv" REF="9"/>his train, soon loses his credit with the reader; he fades, towards the con∣clusion, more and more in every page; and at last, he becomes a desperate, detested man, on whose grave even Pity herself can scarce be prevailed on to shed a tear.</P>
<P>If, however, this objection, in the breast of any one, still subsists against me, it would be a piece of justice not unworthy the <HI>true</HI> critic, if he would take upon him to recom∣mend the character of <HI>Captain Carlisle</HI> in this work, as officiously as he has discommended that of Mr. SEDLEY,
<PB N="vii" REF="10"/>in the other. In real fact, SEDLEY is the <HI>shade</HI> which will set CARLISLE in the proper <HI>light;</HI> and, although the <HI>stories</HI> through which I have conveyed the moral, are utterly dif∣ferent, yet those, who are candid enough to conceive a book of this kind may be made <HI>systematic,</HI> and who may read the two performances <HI>together,</HI> will, I flatter myself, per∣ceive a connexion (with regard to system) not wholly inapposite.</P>
<P>In fine, <HI>Sedley</HI> is a monster, and <HI>Carlisle</HI> is a man. Let them be ac∣curately compared, and read only
<PB N="viii" REF="11"/>with this view, whenever they are in the hands of the young. As SEDLEY is the object of escape and abhorrence; CARLISLE is that of intimacy and imitation. He is much embarrassed, but he has ho∣nour to bear him up: he is purposely plunged in difficulty, that his <HI>truth</HI> might be the more tried; and that, <HI>being</HI> tried, it might, like fine gold from the fire, come forth the purer. He is <HI>Sedley</HI>'s opposite in every parti∣cular, except the attractions of form (which were given to SEDLEY also only to render <HI>Chesterfieldism</HI> more exact). CARLISLE protects the inno∣cence
<PB N="ix" REF="12"/>that he might have destroyed; he spares the chastity that he might have violated; he endeavours to pre∣serve the wife, whom he might have ruined: he has all the policy of prudence, without deviating from <HI>truth:</HI> he is graced with every polish∣ing ornament of character: instead of <HI>corrupting,</HI> he <HI>enriches</HI> society.</P>
<P>That the hero of the present work might have every <HI>ultimate</HI> ad∣vantage, so as to bring the <HI>moral</HI> which his adventures convey, more forcibly home to the business and bosom of the reader, he appears, at
<PB N="x" REF="13"/>different times, in all the amiable <HI>lights</HI> of which his picture is suscep∣tible. Amongst these, the honour of his friendships, the tendernesses of his love, the delicacy of his suffer∣ings, his discretion under embarrass∣ments, and his courage in exigencies, will not escape the attentive reader. It should be noted, also, that the contrast of the present, with the former performance, receives still greater force, by the introduction of other sketches which will be found here; particularly the short scenes that belong to Mr. <HI>Henry Hewson,</HI> and his brother. These
<PB N="xi" REF="14"/>characters are interwoven, not so much to enliven, and relieve the deepness of the pathetic in the other parts, as to give greater elucidation to the <HI>system.</HI> With the like view, the characters of the fighting <HI>Med∣way,</HI> and the fearful, frolicksome Sir <HI>Andrew Flight,</HI> have been ad∣mitted, as have those of Mr. <HI>Las∣celles,</HI> the <HI>Marchioness of N</HI>***, and <HI>Lucia De Grey.</HI> It is hoped, these all promote the moral as much as they contribute to the interests of the fable: for example, <HI>Sedley,</HI> the Pupil of Pleasure, was uniformly vicious, deceitful, and reprobate,
<PB N="xii" REF="15"/>and therefore <HI>died.</HI> Captain <HI>Carlisle,</HI> the Tutor of Truth, is invariably just, ingenuous, and good, and therefore <HI>lives. Sedley</HI> often felt the stroke of ill success, but consoled himself in the worst of times with the hope of accomplishing his wicked wishes at last. <HI>Carlisle</HI> is sensible of disappoint∣ment too, but is kept from paroxisms of despair by a silent appeal to his con∣science. <HI>Lascelles</HI> is at once rakish, false, dissolute, and therefore meets with punishment. The <HI>Marchioness of N</HI>***, though pitiable, is also an object of terror to be held up to the female world, since the same imprudence will naturally lead to the
<PB N="xiii" REF="16"/>same mi-fortunes. The Earl and Countess of <HI>Blessingbourne</HI> are brought into this work, to shew, that, <HI>true politeness</HI> and <HI>the Graces,</HI> are charms independent of mere rank, titles, or estate: the family of the <HI>Hewsons</HI> are here, to prove, that, <HI>true politeness</HI> and the <HI>Graces</HI> are not to be bought, as mere marketable commodities, whenever a man happens to have money to spare; and to prove like∣wise, that neither rustic manners on the one hand, nor bookish pedan∣try on the other, will enable men to leave the farm-house and the cloyster to figure, more respectably, in a state
<PB N="xiv" REF="17"/>of refinement. In full opposition to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll</HI> these, therefore, the Hero of this work is produced. He is as truly polite as he is truly generous, and, agreeable to the title given to him at setting out—He is A TUTOR OF TRUTH.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Brother Gab,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ACCORDING to custom, I am to send you joy upon the <HI>cassion</HI> of grandfather's <HI>stealing</HI> off. As you and I were <HI>in at the death,</HI> and got such a swinging <HI>edition</HI> to our fortune, it would
<PB N="2" REF="19"/>be the <HI>most ungratefullest</HI> thing in the world not to pray for the peace of the old fellow's soul, seeing too, that his body is now out of the way. Our Par∣son says, it behoves us to <HI>direct</HI> a bit of a monument to his memory: for my part, I see no matter in these same monu∣ments: none of the folk of our county need to be told what concerns old <HI>Heid∣edger Hewson;</HI> and so, what's the use of making a long <HI>preachment,</HI> and flourish∣ing away upon a marble slab, about a dead man? Parson prates so much about <HI>gratitude,</HI> that I begin to think he <HI>magines</HI> we ought to tell it on tomb∣stone about our fortune. As 'tis a strange affair altogether, I have a good mine to do this—nay, I have already drawn up a piece of writing, which I send you: let me know in your answer by Nicholas the carrier, whether 'twill do, and whether you will be half the
<PB N="3" REF="20"/>money towards the <HI>direction</HI> of the mo∣nument, seeing as how, gold letters, and church masonry, and indeed all bu∣siness about dead <HI>corpsesses,</HI> comes heavy. But yet, I think, we ought to <HI>touch off</HI> the old fellow with a few flourishes, see∣ing that somebody may do the same for us one day or another. Let me know how you <HI>feel yourself,</HI> since you became a man of fortune. Do you eat, sleep, talk, walk as you did?—For <HI>my</HI> part— but I won't tell you a sillabel, 'till you answer me. I shall only say, at pre∣sent, that I find I am no more the man I was since my fortune, than a hare is like a hand-saw. Nevertheless,</P>

<SALUTE>Brother HENRY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF any thing which relateth to that aweful period, to which all human beings are precipitating, and to which all that hath <HI>vivification</HI> must soon ar∣rive—that period, whereto every thing that is now sporting in the <HI>jollities of sanity</HI> must sooner or later come—I say, brother, were it possible for any thing so aweful, so moral, so moving, so — all that—to suffer the face to be upon the smile, I could <HI>border upon the simper</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="24"/>at certain turns in your epistle. There are some few words in your favour mis∣spelled: for instance; the words <HI>cassion, preachment, magines, corpsesses,</HI> &amp;c. have not yet come under those eyes which have, from first to last, dipt into twenty thousand compositions. Neither is your epitaph devoid of inaccuracies: there being neither pathos in your poetry, nor chastity in your rhyme, all which is absolutely necessary to the present times. <HI>No son</HI> does not echo very melodiously to <HI>Hewson: daughter</HI> and <HI>ater</HI> might be improved: <HI>kin</HI> and <HI>skin</HI> are so very near, my dear HENRY, that they abso∣lutely seem one flesh; their <HI>sounds</HI> are too similar: <HI>respect</HI> and <HI>neglect</HI> may do: but <HI>slab</HI> and <HI>Gab</HI> are the most preposte∣rous words that ever terminated in the way of verse, since rhyming began: nor is a tombstone, with any propriety, called a marble slab.—No, HARRY,
<PB N="8" REF="25"/>no—your meaning is, as it ought to be; but, for your poetry, the less you have to do with the Muses the better: at least wait a little till my dictionary comes out, and then if you have but a ray of Apollo, it will have it out of you; for I will take on me to say no work extant, that <HI>is,</HI> or that <HI>shall</HI> be, will give a man such a knack, or kindle in him such a <HI>furor Phoebi,</HI> as I may call it, as my dictionary.</P>
<P>As to the monument, I cherish your Parson's idea, and will readily pay my <HI>quota.</HI> Pray submit to your clerical friend, who, doubtless, is a judge of these matters, the following inscription. 'Tis written <HI>calamo currente,</HI> and there∣fore its <HI>purities are questionable,</HI> but the idea is perhaps as competent as it should be.</P>

<P>IT'S a lye, GAB; it's all a confounded lye; you are just the man you ever was to a T: or, if there is any alteration, 'tis ninety times nine out of a hundred for the worse. You was al∣ways a <HI>feller</HI> who run rambling round about a story, and never come to the end <HI>on't;</HI> you know you was. You always talked forty times more than needs must, and the devil a word did you say to the pint, <HI>ater</HI> all. Thof you are a fine scholar, I'l make five words go better to a bargain than you can ten, at any
<PB N="12" REF="29"/>time: <HI>cuss</HI> me, if I believe you un∣derstand half you say, <HI>yourself.</HI> Don't you remember, once at Skelter wake, when a lady, your partner, fainted away with dancing, and lost her hand∣kerchief, you said—I shall never forget it—<HI>"the sudorifical drops stood on azure forehead,"</HI> when the poor wench might have SWEATED (for that, it seems, was your meaning) her heart out for you; for the devil an inch will you stir when that flea bites, till all that is in your <HI>cuss'd</HI> crinkum-crankum cranium comes out. And pray, wise Sir, who is obliged to understand your grecum, latinum lingo, do you think? <HI>I</HI> was not cramb'd with such conundrums when I was young, and I <HI>ant</HI> sorry for it, now I'm turn'd of thirty.</P>
<P>With regard to the answer you have made me, 'tis no answer at all: instead
<PB N="13" REF="30"/>of talking of your old grandfather's monument, you have been plaguing yourself with my <HI>noson,</HI> and <HI>Hewson, daughter</HI> and <HI>ater, kin</HI> and <HI>skin, Gab</HI> and <HI>slab;</HI> though, if the truth were known, they are as good as your <HI>cillity</HI> and <HI>gevity, nignance</HI> and <HI>guinity,</HI> and the like. And as to your <HI>dictionary,</HI> it may go, for HARRY. To cut the matter short, brother, I wrote you a very civil, rea∣sonable letter, and in return, you have sent me a <HI>cussed</HI> thing of which I can make neither head nor tail, only I can see plain enough that you think yourself a very clever fellow, and I no wiser than I should be: for that matter, GAB, none of your family were con∣jurors, and I don't believe you are the <HI>senfiblest</HI> o'um neither. But to come to the point: do you choose to answer my letter? Saying I write like a fool, is saying nothing. I want to know whe∣ther,
<PB N="14" REF="31"/>setting aside your Greek and Latin, you are the man you was. I have rea∣sons good for <HI>axing</HI> this, and if you don't like to make answer, why you have only to say so, and you never shall be troubled again by</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VII. Mrs. HENRIETTA HEWSON to Miss DE GREY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE pleasure I expected in your company this season at Helter Skelter Hall must, of necessity, be postponed till the summer following. Every thing is at sixes and sevens; be∣sides which, the large addition to my fortune makes it very improper I should see my friends in the <HI>hugger-mugger</HI> man∣ner I did, while I was as poor as my neighbours. I have positively found out, my dear DE GREY, that there is not a single room in this up and down old mansion fit to sit in, much less to receive
<PB N="21" REF="38"/>the most delicate of her sex. But since I am deprived of the pleasure I expected in having you with me, as usual, I pro∣pose to commence a correspondence with you, that I may tell you from time to time how we go on in those alterations that I am resolved immediately to make. I design to fit up the sweetest retreat in the universe, your father's not excepted —I say <HI>retreat,</HI> because I shall occasion∣ally retreat to it: for, I certainly shall not pass my winters for the future out of Pall-Mall (<HI>that</HI> is, I think I have heard you say, the best quarter of the town) besides its having the double re∣commendation of being the winter resi∣dence of Miss DE GREY.</P>
<P>Just as I writ your name, I happened to look at the chimney-piece, and I ab∣solutely thought it had undergone a per∣fect change within this week; as, in∣deed,
<PB N="22" REF="39"/>in my opinion, hath every thing about the house. I cannot look at an object in the hall or the great garden that does not disgust me. Heaven have mercy on me! how they wanted taste in building formerly! Such huge, horrid, outward doors, studded with such mon∣strous nobs of non; such dreadful arches to every entrance, like the porches of ugly stone-work before a church; such corners, lanes, entries, and alleys, run∣ning like laby rinths through every room: the fire-places so large, the windows so little, the glass of them so diminutive, the wainscotings so figured, the beams so bulky, and the passages so dark and dirty, that they seem built rather to be the dens for beasts of prey, than for such harm∣less little creatures as men and women. Then the gardens are as hideous as the habitations: only to think, LUCIA, of a <HI>con-sumed</HI> great mote, divided only by
<PB N="23" REF="40"/>a nasty drawbridge, running quite round the mansion, most gloriously cropped with duck-weed, and inviting all the fowls of the air to flap their wings and feed about us, to the great annoyance of sleep and every other comfort. Add to this, the gardens <HI>themselves</HI>—I am now lifting up my head from the vulgar old table on which I am writing, and I am taking—I declare to you, almost with tears in my eyes—a view of our precious platform. I behold in pro∣spect about three acres of ground, as completely murdered in the disposition, as a modern gardener could wish: eight-and-twenty yew-trees, interspersed with an equal number of boxes and hollies, rise before me, to whose flourishing shades I am to attribute half the vermin that swarm like a pestilence about us. Let not the abominable walls that sur∣round our dwelling and its environs, be
<PB N="24" REF="41"/>forgotten; high above all height; brown above every thing embrowned.—But I have not patience to proceed. And shall I invite the lovely LUCIA to this Gothic scene? No, LUCIA, no; now that kind Fortune hath put it into my power, I will level with the dust this ruinous pile of building, and raise up in its stead so different a structure, that the very ground shall thank me for <HI>dressing it out</HI> so charmingly. The moment I have compleated my design you shall come and confess I have a relish for improve∣ments. I have, this moment, the exact image of my intentions. Where there are now mountains, will I make vallies; where there are at present crops of nettles, or vulgar flowers that are to me worse than nettles, will I set rows of lillies and beds of roses; roses I mean of <HI>moss,</HI> that scarce burst forth from the bearded bud, elegant, small, odorife∣rous,
<PB N="25" REF="42"/>and not such flaring, flashing, old-fashioned things, as figure away in our garden, that look as if the seeds were sown and the trees planted imme∣diately after the fall; just when all the beautiful in Nature first felt the curse upon it. As to the yew-trees, I will not leave one of them alive, no not even that which is cut into the form of a sugar-loaf; and, so inveterate is my vengeance in regard to these, that I will, yea even after they are fell'd— make the infected wretches perform quarantine at a mile's distance, in open air, before I will allow them the honour of being <HI>burned</HI> in my presence: as to my old friend the <HI>mote,</HI> with whom I have exchanged watry looks, ever since I saw him, I will cause all his channels to be dried up, and <HI>terra firma,</HI> as brother GAB calls it, to flourish about him. The drawbridge will I also remove; and, to
<PB N="26" REF="43"/>shew my dislike and ridicule of such an antique, I will substitute, by way of mockery and the mode, an ha! ha! in his stead. Neither shall any part of our <HI>house furniture</HI> fare better, for there shall be a general <HI>clearance.</HI> Stags heads shall give place to Hogarth's prints: family pictures, notwithstanding the large ruffs on my grandmother's neck, the whiskers on my great uncle's upper lip, and the profusion of chitterlin on my god-papa's bosom, must all yield to politer decorations.—In short, I will create a paradise about me, and that without delay. In the mean time, I will <HI>commence</HI> the woman of fashion, by giving orders never to be seen by any body but tradesmen, till I am all <HI>to∣rights</HI>—not even by LUCIA DE GREY. How I shall bring Mr. HEWSON over to this genteel way of thinking, I don't know; particularly as he is not, you
<PB N="27" REF="44"/>know, the best bred man in the world. However, done it must be—that's flat; for I cannot breathe any longer in such a place! Oh Heavens, how have I breath'd so long! It is equally an affront to my person, my understanding, and my fortune! If any little ornaments strike <HI>you,</HI> that may assist my scheme of embellishing, pray think of them in your next. I design to call one of my new rooms <HI>Lucia</HI>'s <HI>Saloon.</HI> Pray, there∣fore, let LUCIA's fancy assist me in fitting it up.</P>

<P>YES, brother, yes: thou be∣loved branch of the same family; thou dear scyon of the same stock; I again confess, I am not, in any degree, the man I was. This sudden <HI>gale of gay Prosperity,</HI> whose beams are so burnished to the eyes of fragile mortals, hath, I confess, a good deal interrupted the oeconomy of my former affairs; which were too scanty to distract attention, and too abstract <HI>from all circumvolutions</HI> to re∣quire much <HI>mathematical diligence.</HI> Two days before the sudden exit of <HI>him,</HI> to
<PB N="29" REF="46"/>whom I am indebted for this weight of wealth, I was as still and studious a man, as bachelorship and neat 64<HI>l.</HI> 11<HI>s. per annum</HI> could make me. I had a decent collection of classics; I had Homer, in honest sheepskin binding; Horace, with a little edging of gold; and Ci∣cero, my dear Cicero, with his name upon the back of every volume. I had, besides, just such a houshold, as suited well the <HI>propensities of my sequestered no∣tions.</HI> I had an old creature, who pre∣pared my beverage, and was so used to my humour, that she always went out to cough, when I was at my studies: I had a toothless dog, that slept away his leisure, and was too feeble to disturb me by barking; and my cat was the quietest animal that ever purred at the elbow of a scholar in a cloister: Sombre Hedges were exactly to my passion. The two prodigious trees, whose <HI>over∣shadowing
<PB N="30" REF="47"/>ramifications</HI> spread, the <HI>sublime of darkness visible</HI> over my cottage, gave such a <HI>set-off</HI> to my study, that I was absolutely the hero of an hermitage. I sat and read, till I fancied myself, in <HI>the fervor of the intellectual feelings,</HI> a philo∣sopher in the shades. In the dim hour of evening I used to be the companion of the sooty-pinioned bat, and walked forth to meditate on the readings I had made in the day. I rejoiced in the name that the people of the village gave me, and I had a secret pride in seeing them in the twilight, stealing a look at the learned gentleman in the dark house i'th' midst of Sombre Hedges. I was just lighting up my lamp, and setting down to a chapter of Cicero, with Gri∣malkin by my side, when news of my new honours, broke like too mighty a flood of light, upon the serenity of my darkness. I was dazzled, and knew
<PB N="31" REF="48"/>not what to do. For want of habitude, wealth, like a robe first put on, and made <HI>not consonant to our usual fashion,</HI> sat uneasy upon me. As my soul was not fitted to my fortune, neither was my fortune fitted to my soul. I hit upon a passage, where Tully, the prince of La∣tian eloquence, recommended an equal mind in all revolutions; an hour <HI>before,</HI> I should have given to the very printed page an holy kiss of approbation, but, at present, it was no such matter:—I was now to consider myself as master of ten thousand pounds, and I was taken so unawares that I trimmed my lamp in order to see the <HI>will</HI> clearer; and when I had the misfortune to find the thing was <HI>certain,</HI> I was much agitated, and crept at length into the closet, which contained the wholesome bed of a scho∣lar, upon the surface of which I laid
<PB N="32" REF="49"/>down, with a heart that throbbed, and a head that ach'd till the morning.</P>
<P>I rose early, brother, but not to my accustomed satisfaction, for I found my feelings were altered. Those small, but dear attentions, which the day before belonged to an estate of 60<HI>l. per</HI> year, were over. I could not any longer think I was the proprietor of a snug box, when the load of ten thousand pounds sell abruptly upon my shoulders in the lump. I never looked into a book that whole day, and to say truth, I hardly thought there was a <HI>cover</HI> in my study fit to come into the hand of a man of fortune. Was it not some Demon, think you, that put it into my head to take down, three days after, the only <HI>coxcomb</HI> volume in my whole library? and the scope of this was to recommend taste, elegance, fashion, and commerce
<PB N="33" REF="50"/>with men, on purpose to give a finishing to the man of speculation. With an avidity for which I despise myself, did I peruse this work quite through, and from that moment I became a prophane, excentric, dissipated fellow. I said unto the woodman, Fell me those horrid trees that hide me from <HI>the blooming face of Phoebus;</HI> down instantly with these chil∣dren of darkness, that there may be light. I am ashamed to tell you, that I di∣rected my windows to be cleaned; yea, even the little lattice that emitted scarce half a sun-beam into my library, and which was almost vegetable with the over-growth of ivy, did I order to be laid bare to all the splendors of day— Why should I conceal the most <HI>egregious</HI> of my follies? I have at this minute two artificers in my house, and perhaps the passion may gain such sway in a few hours, that, by to-morrow, the corner∣stone
<PB N="34" REF="51"/>of the building may not be suffered to stand. I am already <HI>not</HI> the dark gentleman of Sombre Hedges, but the poor fellow who hath, like a swal∣low in the winter, emerged unseason∣ably from his corner, to blind himself with light. Upon the whole, my heart, like my house, is totally disarranged. I pray Heaven, <HI>yours</HI> may be more com∣posed, and I hope to hear, that your hopes and happiness stand just where they did, before the death of our kins∣man HEIDEDGER.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IX. Mr. HENRY HEWSON to Mr. GABRIEL.</HEAD>
<HEAD>In answer.</HEAD>
<P>I LIKE you ten times better than ever; for I finds <HI>you</HI> are as much altered as <HI>I</HI> am. There never was a more miserable dog than either of us. I dare not say this <HI>before,</HI> for fear you should laugh at me; but now, that I find you are as strange a fellow as my∣self, I tell you, without farther <HI>permable,</HI> that I hant shot a partridge <HI>this</HI> three weeks, and my dogs are yelping in the kennel for fresh air and their sport. People now give me so much <HI>joy</HI> when I go about, that I am quite
<PB N="36" REF="53"/>miserable. My wife HETTY, too, has been <HI>at</HI> me about <HI>pliteness,</HI> and bids me look in the glass to see if it is not a sin and a shame, for such a <HI>par∣sonable</HI> man as I to go such a figure, and shut myself up in an old timber house among hounds and horses, guns and game traps. She says I should be a very <HI>sightly</HI> man, if beard was smoothed oft∣ner, and ruffles put on wrist-bands, after the fashion of young Captain CARLISLE. She says, too, we might now alter our course of life, and live upon our wealth like Mr. and Mrs. Somebody, in a dif∣ferent guess place than Helter Skelter Hall. Upon this I clapt me on a clean shirt, and a pair of silken stockings, after I had doft leathern hunting breeches; and, without <HI>shamming,</HI> I ve∣rily thought, what with the powder in my hair, and ribbon behind in beau∣knot, not forgetting black crevat,
<PB N="37" REF="54"/>which the jade tied so as to make me look—I don't know how—I was one of your <HI>bettermost</HI> persons. As I was walk∣ing along the large hall thus <HI>quipp'd,</HI> old Dashgrove, the setting bitch, barked at me, as if she did not known Master HENRY thro' his finery, upon which I lent her a <HI>douze,</HI> to teach her how to behave to man of <HI>pliteness:</HI> after this, Tippler the spaniel came and fawn'd on me, leaving the track of her paws on my silken stockings, upon which I fa∣voured her also with such a <HI>flick</HI> that the poor thing howled for a quarter of an hour. In short, I can't help speaking <HI>hash,</HI> and taking a little upon me, more than usual: and this was partly the <HI>casion</HI> of my writing you such a rough letter; for, I finds I am grown devilish <HI>touchey,</HI> since I <HI>came</HI> to be a great man; and SUSAN, the maid, says, I am not like to be much the <HI>better</HI> for my riches;
<PB N="38" REF="55"/>seeing, that I have got <HI>them,</HI> and lost my good-nature. I am most consum∣edly troubled to know <HI>what to do;</HI> and, mayhap, <HI>that</HI> makes me growl more than I otherwise should. Sometimes I think of giving up my farm at Skelter, sometimes of buying racing horses; sometimes of making myself <HI>cussed</HI> gay in the <HI>pareil</HI> way; sometimes I have a mind to <HI>crackle</HI> it away in a coach; sometimes to put worsted of different colours on JOE JOBSON's coat, and clap a <HI>cue</HI> to his head—But then again I can't help telling HETTY, this would be damn'd nonsense for a <HI>feller</HI> like I, who have as good a pair of legs as ever worked under a man, and who has gone rough as he run <HI>this</HI> many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> day. I wish grandfather had thought fit to let us know what he meant to do for us about four or five years <HI>agone,</HI> that we might have prepared ourselves to be gentlemen
<PB N="39" REF="56"/>against he died. With such warning I don't doubt but I should have been scho∣lar enough to deck myself off, to strut forth with a little black bag at the end o'me, and to have popp'd in and out of a carriage, very decently: for, damn it, I know how the thing should <HI>goe,</HI> tho' I can't so neatly <HI>do</HI> it. As to Cap∣tain CARLISLE, neither you nor I can ever expect to cut the <HI>dash, he</HI> cuts; 'case why? he was papp'd in <HI>pliteness,</HI> and suck'd civility in his cradle: besides which, he has travelled for it, far and near; so that all the difference in that there matter lies only in the alteration you know. But for all that, if we could, when he comes from <HI>broad</HI> (which is to be soon) get <HI>into's</HI> company now and then, and take notice how he carries himself, how he talks, opens his lips, and the like, I don't doubt but we could make ourselves no small fools, in the
<PB N="40" REF="57"/>way of <HI>haviour,</HI> when he is not <HI>by.</HI> At present, as I can't think of doing as I did, because HETTY says, that would be very unnatural; I am horridly <HI>out of sorts,</HI> and know not what will be the end <HI>on't.</HI> I think, as you are the best scholard, you ought to write to Mr. DE GREY <HI>bout</HI> it, cause he had once the care of us, and, as the world says, made Captain CARLISLE what he is.</P>
<P>To live thus, is out of the question, so pray think of mending the matter. HETTY is airing me another ruffled shirt, and says, I must shift every day now I am a man of property. The linen is rare and hot, so I must ene put it on; have only time, therefore, to say, that</P>

<P>THE spirit of affection and duty made me hasten to leave the gar∣dens of Italy, that I might be in time to enjoy the pleasures of Prudence Green, at this beautiful period of the year. That which was Rome herself, had no charms to attract me, when the lure of such a society, as that which your letter describes to me, was thrown out for my heart. And, is it possible, that I am so soon to return again to all those be∣witching
<PB N="43" REF="60"/>scenes wherein, I first received those admirable precepts which have, hitherto, enabled me to resist temptation in almost every form? I am in London. Nothing can seduce me to continue here beyond the time that is absolutely neces∣sary to my journey; so that I shall be at Prudence Green almost as soon as this short letter, which announces me to you: yet, if there should be a moment's advantage on the side of the letter, pray employ it to tell Miss DE GREY, and the rest of your party, how lingeringly I shall think the time, till I salute them.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XII. From the Same to Mr. LASCELLES in London.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>London.</DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Dear LASCELLES,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM in the most distressing state of mind in the world—the Lady of the Marquis of N. with whom I was on friendly terms in Italy, hath very inad∣vertently, and under colour of an attach∣ment (which I never before discovered) followed me to England. To my utter astonishment she is now before me, too beautiful to be denied protection; and yet, in a situation, on all hands too sacred for me long to bestow it. She
<PB N="45" REF="62"/>set off in a packet that sailed, it seems, at the same time mine did. She is in the habit of a boy: her husband doats upon her. She looks with the brightest eyes into my face, while, with the most persuading voice, she tells me, she is in a strange land, where she knows not a single friend. What is to be done? She came in upon me, just after I had sent Mr. DE GREY's letter to the post, so that it cannot be recalled, and truth requires my promises should be fulfilled —But the Lady must be, some way, accommodated, at least, till she can be persuaded to return to the Marquis.</P>
<P>To <HI>your</HI> care, therefore, I commit her for a little time, and I shall, in the evening, when I have reconciled her to this mode, bring the fair fugitive to your house, where, in the mean time, you will prepare your sister, to receive
<PB N="46" REF="63"/>her. Tell her at once the <HI>truth,</HI> and depend on it, <HI>that</HI> will ever, in the end, turn out for the best.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIII. From the Same to the Same.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>(After delivering the Lady to the latter.)</HI></HEAD>
<P>I WRITE this to my dear LASCELLES, with a hand that trembles for the situation of your fair charge. She discovered, methought, as I deli∣vered her to you, an impatience of temper that may be fatal. She talks of her husband with an ardour of resent∣ment that I believe it is impossible so ac∣complished a man should have deserved. I feel a compunction, not very unlike reproach, at being obliged to refuse her my address. Do you not agree with me, that strong marks of disapprobation
<PB N="48" REF="65"/>were painted in her countenance, when I observed, that all her sentiments would reach me by inclosing them, either sealed or unsealed, to you? I did propose to have set out this day for Mr. DE GREY's, but I must apologize for a little delay, because I judge it best to see how she settles with your family, and to write to the Marquis before I ven∣ture into the country, where I had flat∣tered my imagination with enjoying the most uninterrupted happiness. As she is a native of England, you know, it is possible you may, by some means, trace out her relations, some of whom are, as I have been informed, in Lon∣don; and yet, till we have the Mar∣quis's answer, it may perhaps be a more <HI>de∣licate</HI> piece of integrity to keep the matter out of every body's mouth, but the worthy family to whom it was necessary to entrust it. On second thoughts, therefore, I beg
<PB N="49" REF="66"/>matter may rest where it is, in your faithful bosom, and in that of Miss LASCELLES. In the mean time, if AUGUSTA remains prudent and com∣posed, the whole indiscretion may be done away: every thing may be hushed, and the Marquis be again made happy, without the confusion of being con∣gratulated by people, who turn acci∣dents into table-talk. For my <HI>own</HI> part, I dare say, it will be easy for me to convince the husband that I dealt ho∣nourably. At best, the dilemma is very displeasing, and the only way lest, is to act in it, and to struggle through it, as becomes a man of prudence and principle.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIV. The Marchioness of N. to Signora D. at Rome.</HEAD>
<P>I FOLLOWED him, my VIOLA. I practised to the very utmost, my more than romantic resolution—I eluded even the vigilance of the Marquis—I never lost sight of the exquisite CARLISLE—I surmounted every fatigue—I passed every where, as a beardless youth of the Italian soil; and I am now returned to those shores from whence I drew my first breath, and from whence I was so early carried to that part of your coun∣try where he who is now my husband first saw me.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="68"/>
Yes, VIOLA, I am here—I am in London.—I am within a short mile of the house of CARLISLE.—But, alas! to what purpose? My passion is in de∣spair; my mode of gratifying it has been irregular—I blush at my weak∣ness—but I am still weak enough to love—to love, Viola, with a fervor that is equally my shame and my agony. Yet, I propose only to be within his view—a sight of him—a touch of his hand—his conversation—his smile.— These were my ambition: violent as I am, I tell you the extent of my guilt— But th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ese are already denied me. He has left me in charge of his friends, who are brother and sister—they treat my misfortune with tenderness—the sister speaks warmly of Mr. CARLISLE's vir∣tues. I perceive that the words <HI>honour∣able</HI> attachment are favourites—Confu∣sion, VIOLA! perhaps she is—yet that's
<PB N="52" REF="69"/>not likely—I will not have it so. I could not bear it. At a village on the borders of Italy, my speed brought me near enough to see him salute a female acquaintance; and though modesty and reason, all concurred to sanctify the ci∣vility, yet I wanted dignity enough in my nature, to restrain the execration which I uttered against her beauty. No, no, it is some comfort yet (even were I never more to behold him, which would kill me)—it is some comfort yet, that his heart is without other attachments.</P>
<P>My condition calls for ten thousand comforts, and I foresee, not <HI>one</HI> will be allowed me—I have numberless circum∣stances to tell you, but I want ease and composure to write. The Marquis has, I suppose, left Rome in a rage. For the first time in my life, although I have long despised him, have I taken
<PB N="53" REF="70"/>advantage of his confidence, but it was only to escape from the object of my aversion to that of my fondness—of my adoration.</P>
<P>Perhaps the Marquis may suspect every thing I was so cautious to con∣ceal. If so, my dear CARLISLE is in danger. I am not ignorant of the Mar∣quis's temper. I have <HI>felt</HI> its violence —He struck me, VIOLA; the villain in his meanness struck me! I never shall either forget or forgive it.</P>
<P>CARLISLE in danger!—In danger!— for what—for his unparallelled <HI>integrity</HI> —for his dignity—for his <HI>truth?</HI> Ah, Signora, were he the most guilty, in∣stead of being the most innocent, of men, my romantic soul would take fire at the prospect of his peril, and set life, fame, hope, and Heaven itself, at a
<PB N="54" REF="71"/>hazard to defend him. I am inter∣rupted—Let <HI>my</HI> secret be <HI>your's.</HI></P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>London.</DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WERE it not that your situ∣ation called rather for condolence than mirth, I could acquaint you, in very jocular language, of a circumstance that carries with it the air of an adventure in the days of chivalry.</P>
<P>The heroine, or rather the lady-errant of this enterprize, is your AUGUSTA, who, taking advantage of your journey
<PB N="60" REF="77"/>about the time of my departure, was resolved to be even with you for the anxieties of separation, and so paid you <HI>in kind</HI> by taking a trip to England. I dare say she intended, at first, only to amuse herself with a short excursion to deceive the time till your return: but the spirited creature, with all that ardor which, you know, belongs to her cha∣racter, laid her plan of operation in such a manner, that, when she was once em∣barked, it was absolutely impossible to retreat. She contrived the matter so as to pass upon every body for an Italian stripling travelling to Eng∣land, properly equipped for the opera house: the better to support which, she was provided with suitable habi∣liments, and above all, a distinguish∣ing kind of head-dress, that masked her from every thing but the most critical inspection. It will demand all your
<PB N="61" REF="78"/>best opinion of my veracity, to credit me when I protest to you, that she escaped <HI>my</HI> notice through the whole journey, nor was I acquainted with any part of the circumstance till, in compleating the project, she discovered herself to me in my own apartments in London. It was not for <HI>me</HI> to upbraid her upon the principle of the pain you was suffering; nor was it proper she should remain with one, who has not the honour to be in the married state. I therefore ad∣vised her to be as easy as her reflec∣tions would allow, at the house of a particular friend of mine, who has a sister that will preserve her safe, till she is once more in the arms of her Mar∣quis. The step she has taken was cer∣tainly carrying the joke too far, and, no doubt, she herself thinks so; but when you consider her youth, her high spirits, her well-known fidelity to you, and
<PB N="62" REF="79"/>above all, the perils she has safely passed, without a single soul to protect her, you have, I think, on the whole, rather more reason to laugh it off as a frolic, than to chide her for it as an im∣propriety.</P>
<P>Whatever mode of receiving her you propose shall be attended to, and if you cannot come all the way yourself, I will see that she is re-conducted to the bor∣ders of Italy, or even to your very house in Rome, or to that in Paris, if you judge it necessary. Your answer will determine me in every thing that relates to the lady, whom I have the honour, in the mean time, to have in protection. Be assured, Sir, the trust is as safe as it is sacred; and that I am, with all a friend's anxiety, Your</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIX. Mr. GABRIEL HEWSON to ROBERT DE GREY, Esq.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY brother (dear to me by affinity of blood, and by the coadjoin∣ing bonds of a settled friendship) my brother and I, Sir, have lately been much inveloped <HI>in the deep abyss of me∣ditation.</HI> The additions to our for∣tunes, have, as is but too generally the case, brought with them addi∣tions of <HI>carking care,</HI> and <HI>perturbed reflection</HI>—we find it impossible to en∣joy ourselves as we used to do, be∣fore the benevolence of Fate distin∣guished us by her splendid favours. My
<PB N="66" REF="83"/>brother is unable to take the salutary exercises of the fields and forests, <HI>crown'd with leafy honours;</HI> and I, for my part, can find neither gaiety in Horace, nor argument in Tully. We conceive some∣thing should be done to make riches <HI>sit easy</HI> on us. We believe books will not do this for me, nor hounds for him.— In fine, we are sollicitous, <HI>even to a con∣siderable degree of anxiety,</HI> to acquire a relish of those exterior ornamentals which so particularly mark you and Captain CARLISLE, from all men of our acquaintance. We understand the Captain is shortly to be at the Green; and therefore, as your indulging nature has very often pressed upon us an invi∣tation, we could, conjointly, wish it might be <HI>agreeable to your leisure,</HI> and <HI>consonant to your convenience,</HI> to permit us to pass a few days, under the <HI>sanctifi∣cation of your hospitality</HI> while the Captain
<PB N="67" REF="84"/>is with you, that we may have the ad∣vantage of making ourselves very pass∣able copies from the <HI>reiterated imitation of so admirable an original.</HI> My brother HENRY and I, Sir, are very impatient for the honour of your answer to this <HI>our consequential request.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Hon. Guardian that was,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I UNDERSTANDS that GAB has <HI>'form'd</HI> you of our resolution to be <HI>bet∣termost</HI> persons; whereof the reason's good and natural, seeing that we are not the folks we <HI>was;</HI> seeing we are richer; our <HI>ideerers</HI> are no more the same they <HI>was</HI> than any thing, and I <HI>ha</HI>' put it <HI>into</HI>'s head to see what hand may be made on us, <HI>supposin</HI> we had a good sightly <HI>moral</HI> before us. For certain, the <HI>Captain</HI> is as fine a pattern as need to be taken for any man's <HI>sample,</HI> and you are no
<PB N="69" REF="86"/>small fool at making a bow yourself. You and he, therefore, are the men we mean to cut out by, and my HETTY would have no <HI>'jection</HI> to make a sample of your daughter, who, every body must own, has more the jig of a gentlewoman than any body within ten miles <HI>o'her.</HI> I send these few lines by JOE, just to clap brother GAB's letter, as it were, on the back, and do the thing more <HI>plitely;</HI> for, certainly, the more <HI>parsons</HI> write to a man out of one family, the more respectful. We understands also that you are to have visitors <HI>go lore,</HI> over and above the Captain. <HI>That</HI> we have no sort of <HI>rejection</HI> to: 'case why? We are sure for <HI>sartain,</HI> none are harboured at Prudence Green but your <HI>tip-top specie.</HI> So much the better for <HI>we;</HI> 'case why? As we go on purpose to make a hand on't, and get as much as we can out of every body, why we can take one bit
<PB N="70" REF="87"/>of haviour from one, another bit from another, and so on, till we are <HI>up</HI> to the whole gig of the thing. HETTY is 'ene almost ready to fly over the moon upon <HI>casion</HI> of this—she's a <HI>duced</HI> cute one, at taking any thing in hand she has a mind to, and I <HI>surspect</HI> she'll pull the feathers out of the fine ones till she's as pretty a bird as the best of them. I'd lay two o' my teeth to a <HI>teester,</HI> that she bridles and briggles to a nicety, in less time than I shall want to make me doff hat with decency; for, to tell you the truth, I have a cussed way of being <HI>cover'd</HI> in company; and, I think, it's a pity you was not guardian of my manners, as well as my money.—But I have said enough to shew you what I would be at, and therefore I have no <HI>casion</HI> to make a long affair <HI>ont,</HI> like Master GAB, who, I don't doubt, has muddled his brains never so long, to write to you a fine long <HI>rigmerol,</HI> and pick and choose words
<PB N="71" REF="88"/>out of <HI>diksonnerry.</HI> Mayhap I may be one of your better sort as soon as he, for all his scholarship: not that I would have you <HI>magine,</HI> 'Squire, I don't think GAB knows how to handle a pen: but I think a man may talk a little <HI>plainer</HI> than GAB: aye, and <HI>write</HI> a little plainer too, for I do <HI>sure</HI> you, parson of our parish, who put on his gown at <HI>varsity,</HI> has some∣times enough to do to make him <HI>out,</HI> when he writes his <HI>flourididdles</HI> to me, and HETTY says, he is no more fit for <HI>pliteness</HI> than my dog Dashgrove. But this is <HI>atween</HI> ourselves, 'Squire. I have written my paper <HI>all through,</HI> purpose 'case you should not be <HI>fended,</HI> and if it had been more I would <HI>ha'</HI> gone to the end <HI>on't,</HI> I <HI>'sure</HI> you; for you are just the sort of man I like, and, after all, I don't know when I come to set <HI>this</HI> over against <HI>that,</HI> whether I sha'n't take more of the bettermost person from <HI>you,</HI> than

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY father is writing billets of invitation to your husband and bro∣ther; and he hath assigned to me the pleasing task of requesting you will not forget to join our society, which is to meet on the 30th instant, when it is expected the Green will be exceedingly gay. Besides Captain CARLISLE, there will be a Lord and Lady BLESSING∣BOURNE, and Sir ANDREW FLIGHT, their nephew: they are all persons who are able to form the taste, as far as it depends on fashionable carriage. At
<PB N="74" REF="91"/>the same time, if you will take my ad∣vice, it would rather recommend to you the perpetuation of your original con∣tent, than any attempts at copied splen∣dor. But this is a sentiment out of the line of my commission; and the letter you favoured me with will better be answered in conversation, than upon paper. Do not forget the 30th; and remember, in the mean time,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXII. OLIVER MEDWAY, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> to Mr. TOWNSEND.</HEAD>
<P>I HAD scarce set my foot on Prudence Green, when DE GREY put into my hand a letter which not only mentions the arrival of CARLISLE in England, but his coming post into the country. This news was confirmed by the charming LUCIA, with a smile upon her face. In my opinion, TOWNSEND, a <HI>better intentioned</HI> smile than she ever bestowed upon me. To be sure, an old friend hath a claim upon one's cordi∣ality, and no man deserves so large a share as Captain CARLISLE.—No man better loves him and his virtues than <HI>I</HI>
<PB N="76" REF="93"/>do—and, certainly, a smile upon the subject of <HI>expecting</HI> him, was not wrong. —But why so very <HI>kind</HI> a formation of the features? why must the eyes sparkle so brilliantly on the occasion? why this rapture so directly upon the very front of his arrival?—I have the tenderest re∣gard for CARLISLE in the world, but if —confusion!—I must not be sported with—my passion is too nice, too noble, and too near my heart for that. I must look about me a little.</P>

<P>AFTER having told you in a few words, that you are as welcome to me as ever was friend to friend, I must ask you a question, which, if you have time (as your last billet to Mr. DE GREY mentioned a short delay) I intreat you will answer by the post, even before you come amongst us. You are not igno∣rant of my regard for LUCIA: I have sent you, from time to time, fifty sheets of paper on the subject. I have reason to think <HI>you</HI> are as great a favourite as
<PB N="78" REF="95"/>myself. No woman should dare to di∣vide her heart. I insist upon an <HI>entire</HI> passion, or none. You know my hu∣mour. I love you above all men; but if you have, <HI>even in thought,</HI> supplanted me, let the needful be done without noise. Seconds are out of the question, when combatants know each other. You are as brave as Heaven. I am not apt to retreat myself. There was a sort of satisfaction in LUCIA's face, I must ab∣solutely have <HI>explained.</HI> I have, in DE GREY's green paddock, the best and fleetest horse in England at this time grazing—He <HI>knows</HI> when I travel upon <HI>life and death</HI>—you understand me.</P>

<P>How can you, my dear MEDWAY, still continue your cruel hu∣mour? How few moments thinking would have been necessary to set your fluttering heart to rest on every subject that concerns LUCIA DE GREY! The vehemence with which you first disclosed your passion to me, and the large strides you said you had made towards gaining HER affections, put an entire end to all attempts which, perhaps, might other∣wise have been made by <HI>me</HI> upon the subject. Neither by look nor letter have I, ever since that time, addressed any thing to LUCIA that aimed at her
<PB N="81" REF="98"/>heart, and your three latest letters (which came to my hands in Italy) wherein you assure me, your tenderness for that lady is fully <HI>returned,</HI> put such an additional check upon my conduct, that I looked upon the business as too far gone for any third person, except Mr. DE GREY, who, it seems, ap∣proves the match, to interfere without infamy. Besides that I shall embrace you shortly, I have just now such a kind of engagement to fulfill, that I must apologize for having replied to your letter so hastily.

<HEAD>LETTER XXV. Captain CARLISLE to GEORGE LASCELLES, Esq.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT is to be done now, my dear LASCELLES?—a circumstance hath fallen out, even worse than the affair of AUGUSTA. Mr. DE GREY forgot to inform me, that the only per∣son whom I should not meet at Pru∣dence Green would make a distinguish∣ed member of his summer society! But yet, how should he imagine it was ne∣cessary to apprize me of it, knowing, as he does, of our long friendship, and <HI>not</HI> knowing there is any <HI>delicate matter</HI> on which it depends? The nature of my difficulty will appear to you better, when
<PB N="83" REF="100"/>I tell you <HI>Medway</HI> is of the party— MEDWAY, the most generous, positive, good-humoured, quarrelsome man in the universe—MEDWAY, whose sensibi∣lity of honour, and jealous misconcep∣tions, expose him every hour to a ha∣zard of his life. If you have forgot my situation with this flaming hero, the inclosures will revive the whole track of the story in your memory. Had I not apprehended that he was to pass the summer in Oxfordshire, I should, by no means, have accepted of an invitation even from Mr. DE GREY; nor indeed should I, by right, have left Italy till the secret cause of my going thither be∣came Mrs. MEDWAY, and had retired with her husband from Prudence Green. As the good of society is no way con∣cerned in the communication of this my private bosom secret, no man but Mr. LASCELLES is trusted with it.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="101"/>
As to AUGUSTA, I am glad to find she is so well reconciled to our last con∣versation. Your sister will certainly, by her enchanting treatment, make a tho∣rough convert of her; and at least keep her quiet without more interviews till I get the Marquis's answer. Were it not, therefore, for MEDWAY's affair, I should now go down to the Green in high spi∣rits. With regard to LUCIA, I consider her so much the property of another, that I could certainly meet her <HI>unalarm∣ed,</HI> were not that other under the same roof.</P>

<P>HE comes! he comes!—this night he will be here—yes, my dear LASCELLES—CARLISLE will this <HI>very</HI> night be here; but, perhaps, your bro∣ther, his old friend, may have already heard from him. We all wish for him with the fondest impatience. Even the impetuous MEDWAY acknowledges him to be a man of the finest honour in the world. By the bye, CAROLINE, that MEDWAY is a strange being; I know not what to make of him—he is always begging me to smile upon him, and when I <HI>do</HI> smile, he whispers in my
<PB N="90" REF="107"/>ear, "hush! hush! my dear soul, hush! don't <HI>speak</HI> about it—a smile is enough; a smile is enough." He came to me yesterday evening in the garden, and must needs change flowers—I agreed to his humour, and he cried out (in a transport that almost frightened me) "such a little transaction as this, with those who act upon terms of honour, binds the bargain as firmly as the bonds of Hymen." He may be a very gallant man, my dear, but he is the strangest creature I know, for all that, and though our acquaintance is of two years standing, he is as much a riddle to me as ever. The best part of him is, that he is the friend of CARLISLE—<HI>I</HI> am CARLISLE's FRIEND too, but I still enjoin you not to hint this to any crea∣ture breathing. A little before I first saw MEDWAY, I really thought CAR∣LISLE had an affection for me; but
<PB N="91" REF="108"/>many things have concurred since, to persuade me, that I am not only indif∣ferent, but disagreeable to him. His excursion to <HI>Italy,</HI> above all other things, confirms this.—Ah, CAROLINE! how can so gentle and susceptible a heart as his be insensible to—But I have done.</P>

<P>OH! joy, joy, give me joy without end, my dear HEATHCOATE! Such game, such fun, such a summer is before me, that neither you or I can possibly want amusement. Prudence Place is absolutely crammed with <HI>the</HI> entertainment which, of all others, you and I most adore; even with the plea∣sures of <HI>ridicule.</HI> There are no less than three originals in the house, besides my uncle and aunt, who, even yet, are not entirely out of date. Here is a farmer who would be a <HI>gentleman;</HI> his wife, beautiful as Venus, who would be a
<PB N="95" REF="112"/><HI>lady.</HI> The farmer's brother, who, tho' neither fish, flesh, nor fowl, designs to be a scholar; and my dear aunt and uncle, who are magnificent, superb, high-bred—<HI>nothings at all.</HI> With such a groupe, (not forgetting that son of the seven Furies, OLLY MEDWAY) if I don't have some precious sport, and send you from time to time some sheets full of <HI>fun,</HI> why then I have lost my knack, and nature tries to entertain me in vain, this summer. That's all I say on the subject.</P>
<P>As to LUCIA DE GREY, and her dad, they are quite upon the grave order you know, and a man may look at their tempers for twelve months together, without finding a tittle that is ludicrous; so that, I fear, we can scarce rank any of these amongst our sources: no mat∣ter, ridicule is pregnant in every mo∣ther's
<PB N="96" REF="113"/>child of the <HI>others,</HI> and you may expect to have a dish of the dear, dear ridiculous (to <HI>me</HI> more palatable than ortolans) at least every second post-day. But, heighty-teighty, who have we here! What figure comes prancing down yon avenue, majestic as the oaks which shade, and debonnair as the skies which encanopy it! It gains upon me as I survey it from the window. Those little animals called men, when mounted upon the backs of those larger animals called horses, are proper objects for the sport∣ings of such spirits as our's, my HEATH∣COATE. But, in this <HI>particular instance,</HI> in this most brilliant exception, there is no hinge whereon to fasten a joke: <HI>this</HI> object looks like a <HI>man</HI> even while he is bestriding a <HI>beast.</HI> His hair is caught by the gale—his proportions charm away the very genius of <HI>burlesque.</HI> I have not a jest in my imagination to
<PB N="97" REF="114"/>throw at him. No fun in <HI>this</HI> visitor neither!—He alights—Zounds, HEATHCOATE, this fellow hath found out the art of displaying the graces in getting from his stirrup: the very horse seems conscious of his burthen: he gives a paw of reluctance at quitting him. The family are all flocking about the stranger—what prince—what deity is it who can thus attract universal at∣tention, and turn <HI>my</HI> descriptions out of their accustomed channel!</P>
<P>I must lay down the pen to enquire.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<PB N="98" REF="115"/>
<HEAD>In Continuation.</HEAD>
<P>HEATHCOATE, could you possibly believe it?—The very image of one of my <HI>oldest</HI> acquaintances, yea even of my schoolfellow (who was a clever fellow when I was a dunce) had quite left me— yes, HEATHCOATE, such improvements are made in every part of <HI>Captain Car∣lisle's ever</HI>-handsome person, that I knew him not, till another of his ornaments (melting from his captivating voice) brought him again into my memory. One would think there could be no great matter of attraction for such a lu∣dicrous being as I, in seeing a young man pay compliments to a parcel of people, who were <HI>prepared</HI> for such ci∣vility; and yet, by my soul, I stood
<PB N="99" REF="116"/>gaping at this salutation, as if I was as young a beginner as the HEWSONS. I question, whether the god of Breeding himself could have pulled off his hat with such an air—then his attention was so properly <HI>distributed</HI>—Zounds, HEATH∣COATE, his bows went through the very souls of the women—But what have <HI>I</HI> to do with <HI>such</HI> a subject!—CARLISLE is come to make us all look ugly in the eyes of the wenches, and so there is an end of it.—</P>
<P>However, for this disappointment <HI>one</HI> way, I am resolved to have full measure of revenge <HI>another:</HI> since a brighter sun appears, and <HI>I</HI> can only be in shadow, I am determined not to be disgraced without vengeance. As I cannot <HI>shine,</HI> I will <HI>laugh</HI> most inordinately; and I here swear by the rubied lips of LUCIA DE GREY, that I will enjoy every thing
<PB N="100" REF="117"/>that ridicule can fairly catch at through∣out all the flowery regions of Prudence Place. Neither man nor beast shall escape me, if either leaneth, yea but ever so little, to the ludicrous. This vow is sealed by the sanction of Jupiter: I nod, and knit my brows upon it.</P>

If this prospect of being perpetually tormented by the vigilant jealousies of this hot-headed man continues, and if I cannot so far master my own sensibilities on a certain occasion, my stay in this quarter will certainly not be long.

I pique myself a little upon the virtue of making a seasonable <HI>retreat.</HI> My sensibility tells me <HI>now,</HI> that I am <HI>here</HI> in danger: I should be, by no means, in a road absolutely safe, if I
<PB N="105" REF="122"/>were with <HI>you.</HI> It will require some adroitness to disentangle myself. If matters do not mend, I must alter my present address; although, were my <HI>heart</HI> quite easy, I could be well enough amused with this motley groupe at Pru∣dence Place, and enter into every inof∣fensive levity with the most serious spirit imaginable. You see, by the air of my letter, that at present I can neither write or speak with certainty of <HI>any thing.</HI> I can only say, in general terms, that the joys I anticipated, like most things fore∣stalled, do not sparkle in the cup so briskly as I expected; they are dashed by some bitter disappointments. I have a passion fretting my heart, which hath no lawful right to lie in my bosom. I feel it to be the tyrannizing serpent;—I smart under the sharpness of its tooth, and yet, like the man in the fable, I foster it. Do you not think, my LAS∣CELLES,
<PB N="106" REF="123"/>that LUCIA's passion for the boisterous <HI>Medway,</HI> is a little inconsist∣ent with that uncommon delicacy and <HI>gentleness</HI> which seem to mark her own mind? But there is nothing so idle as an attempt to decypher the hierogly∣phics of love. Mr. MEDWAY is the man of her choice; Mr. MEDWAY is, therefore, not to be questioned upon the subject of his <HI>success.</HI></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>(Previous to receiving the above.)</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT touches me very nearly to be so soon under a necessity of trans∣mitting to you a letter from our fair lady, which, if I may judge from the air of anger with which it was given, does not contain the sentiments of a quiet disposition. Previous to your com∣ing here the other night, I saw through the little artifice of her <HI>dressing at you</HI> in full taste: it brought to my mind that sweet line of the poet:
<Q>Now aweful beauty puts on all her charms.</Q>
<PB N="108" REF="125"/>Notwithstanding this, you had fortitude of <HI>resistance</HI> superior even to her <HI>beauty.</HI> How you are able to do these things is wonderful: for my part, I fairly con∣fess, if I knew any lady, of any country, half so lovely, and half so longing, I certainly should suffer any little <HI>scruples</HI> I might have to be soon over-ruled; and were it in my power to make such a wo∣man happy, happy she should be. As to the Marchioness, she hath fire enough in her eyes even to talk down the conti∣nence of an anchorite. Not that I blame your virtue, or accuse your taste. No, my dear CARLISLE, I admire both; I look up to the one with envy, to the other with despair. But this is no time either for comment or compliment: the Marchioness's letters to you ought in∣stantly to be forwarded, since, from the peculiar <HI>violence</HI> of her temper, a mo∣ment's delay might produce the most
<PB N="109" REF="126"/>disagreeable consequences. My sister wishes every hour for the Marquis's letter, although it is impossible he should get <HI>your's</HI> for some time. The two la∣dies parted from each other yesterday in tears. I am not yet master of the meaning. CAROLINE's confidence is impregnable; unless she thinks it <HI>right</HI> to disclose any matter, her dearest friends would not be let into the secret.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXI. The Marchioness to Captain CARLISLE.</HEAD>
<P>HAVE I not sufficient cause to curse my fate, that hath left me without one solid reason to sanctify my affection? Have I not reason too, to curse that barbarous father, who sacrificed me to the most hateful man upon earth—who sold me for a title which I despise, and to embraces which are bitter to me as the bonds of death? The great, the counterbalancing arguments, Mr. CAR∣LISLE, are all on your side, and there∣fore my pleadings are all against the tide. But I see all that is to happen— you will never see me more—you refuse me your direction—you will have your
<PB N="111" REF="128"/>London apartments—your friends will grow weary of me, and I shall be in utter despair. Ah! what a foundation have I for such suspicions! How cuttingly cold was the air with which you last ad∣dressed me! How cautiously cruel your civility!—You took my hand, but it trembled as if at the touch of infection, while mine, on the contrary, throbbed with a violence that denoted the agita∣tions of my heart. Your whole dis∣course was <HI>general;</HI> or, if it ever be∣came <HI>particular,</HI> it turned upon my husband—the most detested of all sub∣jects. But this was not enough; you dare not trust yourself with me alone: I am reduced to such infamy that it was necessary to converse with me in the presence of a third person; that third person, too, must needs be a <HI>wo∣man.</HI> But you were deceived: I did not in that complotted interview shew
<PB N="112" REF="129"/>myself so abandoned as you expected: I was conscious of the deepness of the tri∣umph, and I fell before it. My situ∣ation is not even yet, perhaps, quite erased from your memory. You recol∣lect some part of my confusion. I con∣jure you, however, Mr. CARLISLE, by love, and I charge you by what is due to distress, not to insult her whom you cannot redress. Pity is at least my due, and when you are not disposed to bestow that, for honour's sake, do not substi∣ture contempt. Pray what is to become of the unfortunate</P>

<P>OH, my beloved CAROLINE! Mr. CARLISLE is at our house, and yet I am more wretched than I was before his arrival. He certainly detests me. He speaks in form, and though he can never lose his politeness, which is a part of his very nature, yet he has wholly lost his friendship. How can I possibly have forfeited this? We were bred up together, you know, CAROLINE; al∣ways in the same house, for some time in the same cradle: it is to CARLISLE I owe my early relish for reading, and every better ornament. Nothing could possibly be more cordial, or more fami∣liar,
<PB N="114" REF="131"/>than we were formerly. Wherefore hath he robbed me of his attention—of his <HI>brotherly</HI> attention?—But, I suppose he hath been fortunate in his <HI>Italian at∣tachments</HI>—the friendships of a warmer clime are, doubtless, more attracting and more animated. I know not what to think. Certainly, Mr. CARLISLE never gave me reason to imagine I was more in his esteem <HI>than—than—than—.</HI> But why do I talk, CAROLINE? he ab∣solutely does every thing but flatly shun me.</P>

I write this to tell you that I had no objection to your laughing last night at the HEWSONS— though, had any <HI>man</HI> breathing laughed half so much at me, I would have sent him upon a message to the moon—but, no matter—hush—it is to my content that you should be as pleasant as you please—Burn this—walls have ears— worms have eyes—You understand me.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVI. Sir ANDREW FLIGHT to Mr. HEATH∣COATE.</HEAD>
<P>BETTER and better still! the gudgeons bite this warm weather at Prudence Place most gloriously. Every minute teems with ridicule. I have played off that <HI>heaviest of the Hewson lump,</HI> Mr. <HI>Henry,</HI> upon my <HI>uncle,</HI> yea even upon the pompous muscles of Lord BLESSINGBOURNE, to whom the farmer hath written in form, just to <HI>get into's fist,</HI> as he elegantly phrases it. I spi∣rited him up to this, and so contrived it, that the letter should be given to his Lordship exactly at the proper crisis— even while he was at a magnificent tête∣à-tête
<PB N="124" REF="141"/>with my Lady upon that constant subject of theirs, the dignity of rank and family. I took care also to enter his room, by the way of morning <HI>devoir,</HI> just as the epistle was delivered—No co∣ronet at the top of the seal—and yet— the scrawling and <HI>genteel up-and-down of the superscription</HI> is politely illegible enough, to come from <HI>somebody</HI> of <HI>rank,</HI> says the Earl — Dost thou know the hand, my Lady—No indeed, my Lord —It is not in my list of hands—If it ap∣proaches towards <HI>any</HI> of my correspon∣dents — continues my lady — it is the Countess of Cannotspell. In my opinion, my Lady, said I, it bears strong marks of the Duchess of Letterblot; that copious command of capitals in the L.O.R.D. looks astonishingly like the finger and thumb of her Grace.—Whew, says my uncle, there's no post-marks: I can't possibly account for this, my Lady. Ten
<PB N="125" REF="142"/>to one, uncle, replied I, the contents will unravel the mystery in a moment; that is to say, if the writing is not <HI>too fashionable.</HI></P>
<P>His Lordship broke the seal which Mr. HENRY told me he once valued much, it being the exact effigy of the finest greyhound bitch that ever <HI>nabbled the scut of a bare</HI>—None of <HI>my</HI> friends fasten letters, nephew, with the engrav∣ing of a <HI>dog</HI>—</P>
<P>Heaven and family-honours, exclaims my never-to-be-forgotten uncle, what have we here, with <HI>my very good Lord</HI> at the top, and <HI>your H. Hewson</HI> at the bot∣tom? H. HEWSON! Pray, who is this familiar Mr. H. HEWSON? I suf∣fer no freedoms from such pens as these.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="143"/>
No, indeed, don't you, said my Lady.</P>
<P>Suffer <HI>me</HI> to read it to you, my Lord, said I; I can't possibly conceive the meaning of it.</P>
<P>I read it, HEATHCOATE, and gave it all its graces. It was not without great difficulty the angry Earl <HI>sat it out.</HI> His comments were exquisite. I inclose the original, on purpose that you may com∣pare a few of them—a <HI>simularius!</HI> cried his Lordship, what does the fellow mean by that? <HI>Prudunce Pleace:</HI> and pray, how could Mr. DE GREY, at his grave time of life, admit such a creature as this to <HI>Prudunce Pleace? Prudunce Pleace,</HI> rejoined my Lady; oh! the illi∣terate—ha! ha! ha!</P>
<P>I went on, but was soon stopped again. A woman of <HI>the bettermost specie,</HI>
<PB N="127" REF="144"/>a <HI>lady of this genii,</HI> and <HI>for she to write to she</HI>—did you ever hear such impu∣dence, said I, my Lord?</P>
<P>Impudence, replied my Lady! Pray, nephew, order my coach this very day. Does <HI>Mr.</HI> DE GREY (who, though a very worthy man, is only a <HI>Mr.</HI>) imagine we are to be insulted by <HI>rifraff,</HI> whom he thinks fit to make our <HI>equals?</HI> They may, perhaps, be equals for a <HI>Mr.</HI> but they are no proper company for persons whose names move upon a <HI>different con∣struction.</HI></P>
<P>That's very true, aunt, said I, and it's perfectly unpardonable in that little, low-minded monosyllable <HI>Mr.</HI> to behave thus rudely to names of a nobler sound, and a different construction. <HI>Mr.</HI> in∣deed! I should not have thought of it!</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="145"/>
Don't be witty, ANDREW, neither, says my aunt.</P>
<P>Madam, your Ladyship does me wrong, said I, I despise <HI>Mr.</HI> as cordially as your Ladyship, and I even bought <HI>Sir Andrew,</HI> that I might never have any thing more to do with him. <HI>Mr.</HI> quotha!</P>
<P>Be that as it may, nephew, rejoined my Lord (rising upon his toes, and swelling out his breast, as is usual with him when he feels the <HI>might</HI> of any sen∣timent) be that, I say, as it may— You very well know the <HI>stock</HI> from whence our family sprung. You very very well know, that we have not a plebeian particle about us; and though it is very true you bought <HI>Sir Andrew</HI> with my money, on account of my ab∣horrence of <HI>Mr.</HI> yet you have the best
<PB N="129" REF="146"/>of blood in your veins.—Yes, nephew, I will take upon me to say, with very little exaltation of voice, you have the best blood. Heaven, and family-ho∣nours, here's usage indeed!</P>
<P>Thank Heaven and my noble-blooded ancestors, my Lord, nobody better, said I.</P>
<P>The veins of your aunt are not less dignified—</P>
<P>Sensible of that, my Lord, said I, her Ladyship's fine blood shines beside her fair complexion, like the violet that groweth among the lillies of the valley.</P>
<P>Not amiss, said my uncle, simpering!</P>
<P>'<HI>Pshaw,</HI> you madcap, cried my aunt, patting my shoulder, and looking at
<PB N="130" REF="147"/>the back of her hand, after gently rubbing it.</P>
<P>Hang it, rejoined my uncle, forget∣ting for a moment his dignity, this poor H. HEWSON means no harm after all; he is a poor simple thing.</P>
<P>An unfortunate fish out of water, you may see by all his actions, said I, and I dare say thinks he has lived upon shore long enough, since he has had the ho∣nour to write a letter to Lord and Lady BLESSINGBOURNE.</P>
<P>Do you think so, nephew? cried my uncle and aunt (tickled by the flat∣tery); well, then, let us not be offend∣ed: let the affair drop.</P>
<P>I do really think, my Lord, rejoined I, if you were to write him an <HI>answer,</HI>
<PB N="131" REF="148"/>you would make the poor fellow feel, as if he were in Heaven.</P>
<P>Answer him, said my Lord; what can I say to such a being?</P>
<P>Say something, however, said my Lady, to the poor devil.</P>
<P>My uncle ordered the writing appa∣ratus; and after as much writing as might have been necessary to lay the plot of a comedy, he wrote upon a large gilt card, in a hand very little better than HEWSON's, the following senti∣ments:</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="132" REF="149"/>
<HEAD>To H. HEWSON.</HEAD>
<P>THE Earl and Countess of BLESSING∣BOURNE received H. HEWSON's letter, containing a simularius, and several other curiosities, worthy the pen of such a genii as H. HEWSON. As H. HEW∣SON'S HETT. is, it seems, a person of the <HI>bettermost specie,</HI> the Earl and Countess have no objection to <HI>she writing to she,</HI> as often as <HI>she</HI> chooses. As Sir ANDREW FLIGHT, who is, it appears, H. HEW∣SON'S friend, conveys this card, there is no occasion to watch any <HI>slyer</HI> opportu∣nity to get it to H. HEWSON's hand. The Earl and Countess have only to de∣sire H. HEWSON will not boast of this honour received from them, and to ad∣dress them in <HI>public</HI> as little as possible, at least till he and his HETT. are <HI>better∣most perso<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="133" REF="150"/>
This card, HEATHCOATE, penn'd so exactly to my wish, after being sealed with a flourish of the best wax, and stamped with the broad BLESSING∣BOURNE arms, capped with a coronet, and decorated with supporters, was de∣livered to my care.</P>
<P>I carried it to the farmer-gentleman, whom I found disputing the point of politeness with that beautiful piece of ignorance his wife.—She was pleased to be hugely offended by the contents of his Lordship's card, and declared, that Mr. HEWSON writ without her know∣ledge.—As to acquaintances, she had plenty—that she wrote every night to Miss DE GREY, and chose to owe her improvements to her own ingenuity.</P>
<P>Then it's not my fault, cried the husband; you will bear me witness, Sir
<PB N="134" REF="151"/>ANDREW, I have done <HI>my</HI> duty; 'tis none of my seeking that she won't <HI>hor∣respond</HI> with a Ladyship, and a Count∣ess: as for <HI>my</HI> part, I am not above getting all I can out of high and low; so I shall write just as I see <HI>cassion,</HI> either to my Lord or Maister HEATHCOATE.

<P>Away he went, and I enjoyed the society of his HETT. all alone.

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVII. Captain CARLISLE to GEORGE LASCELLES, Esq.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE had a very foolish ac∣cident happen to aggravate the uneasiness of the Marchioness's last letter. It is in itself a trifle, yet the consequence to my <HI>peace</HI> will make it important to you. Sir ANDREW FLIGHT was playing off his witticisms and waggeries upon the igno∣rance of some country simpletons that are now at the <HI>Place,</HI> when I became so weary of his vociferous amusement; for where is the pleasure of sporting with inexperience —that I withdrew to Mr. DE GREY'S garden, unobserved, or at least uninter∣rupted, by the company. MEDWAY
<PB N="136" REF="153"/>was watching his fishing-rod: Lord BLESSINGBOURNE was withdrawn to his chamber for his afternoon's nap. Mr. DE GREY'S garden is exceedingly large, and part of it is disposed into a wilder∣ness, whose zig-zag is so intricate that you may sometimes have your whole prospect terminated by a yard's distance. The surrounding foliage, too, is of the thickest growth, being suffered to ex∣pand for several years, receiving from the gardener, from time to time, only such cares and loppings as to render the beautiful confusion more agreeable. Seats and bowers, apparently artificial, with here and there a dripping grotto, are distributed irregularly, and the shades are every where so abundant, that the sun-beams rather cheer you by <HI>stealth,</HI> than by permission. I have, for my own part, an attachment—a sort of sen∣timental friendship, and good-will, for
<PB N="137" REF="154"/>every bench, and for every tree: they were all favourites of my infancy: I sat upon the benches, and I caught instruc∣tion from the lips of Mr. DE GREY, under the trees. This, therefore, was the first time of my hailing them since my return. Believe me, I felt sensa∣tions that thrilled me, as I re-visited the places of my accustomed contemplation; I bade them welcome with as much ar∣dour as if they were animate. I walked along the green meander, recognizing my old acquaintances; I listened to birds whose notes I affected to be <HI>intimate</HI> with my ear, as if they issued from the same warblers I had heard formerly. I com∣plimented the cascades upon an <HI>improved</HI> melody in their cadence: every breeze that played upon every leaf, revived the balmy pleasures of infancy. Even in∣tercourse with other countries (not odo∣rous Italy herself) had not been able to
<PB N="138" REF="155"/>supplant the <HI>tenderness</HI> I bore to the ver∣nal beauties of Prudence Place.</P>
<P>Ah, LASCELLES! what could be the reason of this? Presently I came to an alcove, which was originally the archi∣tecture of two children, who grew up together. It was a whole week's labour, divided betwixt Miss DE GREY and your CARLISLE: our little hands twisted the twigs, formed the archings, and sub∣dued the obstinate shrubs with inconceiv∣able industry. Many a time we rested from the toil, and, as often being de∣lighted with our progress, we renewed it. When it was compleated, we gave —oh, I shall never forget it—a kiss of tenderest congratulation, as at having finished a work of <HI>infinite importance.</HI> Big with this innocent flattery, we ran, hand in hand, to our guardian, and with elated hearts bade him survey well
<PB N="139" REF="156"/>our workmanship. The gravity with which he commended, and his affected astonishment at our <HI>ingenuity,</HI> gave the last and fullest stroke of our pride and vanity. Over the entrance, our guardian caused to be imprinted upon a label, in golden letters, this soothing intelligence to the stranger:</P>
<P>This Bower was raised by Clement and Lucia.</P>
<P>The robin-redbreast built in it the next, the <HI>very</HI> next year, and we had then, you know, the best reason in the world to think that Heaven itself was pleased with our amusement. The nest, you may be sure, was preserved, for both piety and pity were concerned in its protection. We trod with caution while the <HI>sacred</HI> bird was hatching: the whole feathered family presently took wing; and I do verily believe I hear one of them now whistling near my window.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="157"/>
Oh, LASCELLES! how soon is the heart that wishes to be inoffensive, lulled by little circumstances! Smile not, then, if I tell you, that I saw with transport the names of LUCIA and CLEMENT still legible on their bower—the branches of sweetbriar, on either side, were eagerly extending as if to embrace—and I beheld the initials of my name very <HI>recently</HI> cut in the rind of a hawthorn, that formed one of the supports of our alcove.</P>
<P>What sweet circumstances — how they melt the heart! cried I.</P>
<P>At that moment the softest-tuned voice in the world repeated distinctly the following verses, from her favourite poet:</P>
<Q><PB N="141" REF="158"/>
<LG>
<L>In these deep solitudes, and aweful cells,</L>
<L>Where heav'nly pensive Contemplation dwells,</L>
<L>And ever-musing Melancholy reigns;</L>
<L>What means this tumult in a Vestal's veins?</L>
<L>Why rove my thoughts beyon! this last retreat?</L>
<L>Why feels my heart it's long-forgotten heat?</L>
<L>Yet, yet I <HI>love,</HI> from ABELARD it came,</L>
<L>And ELOISA yet must kiss the name.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>You are not to be told it was LUCIA DE GREY. In the next instant she passed within sight of me, the book still in her hand. Unprepared on both sides for the surprize, we were inexpressibly confused. Beautiful lines, Miss DE GREY, said I. Yes, indeed, replied she. I think, Miss DE GREY, in a former part of our life we used fre∣quently to read the charming Mr. POPE <HI>together</HI>—In this very garden, Mr. CAR∣LISLE; do you recollect your old bower, said she? If I mistake not, Madam, said I—Madam, CLEMENT? Madam,
<PB N="142" REF="159"/>Mr. CARLISLE? replied she, as if a little offended. I say, continued I, Miss DE GREY, if I remember right, <HI>this</HI> is that bower. You had almost forgot it, then, Mr. CARLISLE, had you? I suppose <HI>Italy</HI> (the garden of the universe) hath put all our <HI>English</HI> roses quite out of countenance: Prudence Place is, to be sure, a mere nettle-bed.—Ah, no, Ma∣dam! (said I, upon the edge of an ex∣planation, but happily checking myself in time) though certainly Italy hath its charms. Oh, no doubt of it, replied LUCIA; but I believe, Sir, the com∣pany will have lost their chief felicity by your absence. I hear Mr. <HI>Medway</HI> coming; I know his rapid, random step; and I dare say his errand is from the deserted society to the runaway Cap∣tain CARLISLE. If you please, Miss DE GREY, we will retire, then. I will just finish my poem and follow you, Sir.
<PB N="143" REF="160"/>We parted. 'Tis evident she loves MEDWAY to distraction, LASCELLES — She <HI>knows his step.</HI>—He was then in search of her, <HI>doubtless, by her appoint∣ment.</HI>—I wish them happy—very, very happy. But my head aches; my heart is not quite well; and I must wish you a good night.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVIII. Mr. MEDWAY to Mr. TOWNSEND.</HEAD>
<P>CONFUSION, TOWNSEND! I have discovered the plot—I have got a clue to the whole matter. I am, I per∣ceive, a very catspaw. I am made the convenient cloak to conceal the passion of <HI>another.</HI> Yes, TOWNSEND, I saw CARLISLE at the very farthest end of DE GREY's garden in earnest conversa∣tion with LUCIA: at my approach he turned into a different walk, and went into the house. I overtook the guilty fair one, and caught her in the very act of reading ELOISA to ABELARD; which is as much as to say, if I can't talk with him, I can at least <HI>write a letter</HI> to him;
<PB N="145" REF="162"/>and I dare say they do correspond: every body in this family scribbles, and I don't at all doubt but there is fine flourishing penwork going forward be∣tween LUCIA and CARLISLE. As to the first, I only walked quickly <HI>by</HI> her, without deigning to <HI>speak,</HI> and I pulled off my hat with unusual respect, as much as to say—Oh, oh, my young lady, have I caught you! I shall repeat the same behaviour when I meet her again, and then it is impossible she should mistake my meaning. With re∣spect to the Captain, whom I honour as a friend and gentleman, in every <HI>other</HI> matter, his life is not worth sixpence, for he must as surely die this night, as that he insulted me this day; or else he must injure me still more, by taking me off. I only write this to you, TOWN∣SEND, just to account for any delay in my correspondence, should it be <HI>my</HI> fate

<HEAD>LETTER XLIV. Mr. HENRY HEWSON to Mr. HEATH∣COATE, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Esquire HEATHCOATE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>GIVE every man his title and dignification, as Lord BLESSINGBOURNE says, therefore I begin my <HI>horrespondunce</HI> with you, at the instigation of Sir AN∣DREW, with calling you Esquire, which is certainly your due, seeing you are out of trade, and do <HI>nothing at all for your livelyhood.</HI> I am to write what I get in the way of breedin, it seems, to you, which is a thing pleasing, see∣ing that you must, without doubt, be a master of the business.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="178"/>
But I believe I shall have a wearisome spell o'work on't, before I am as I should be: case why? there goes more to the making an honest man a gentle∣man than I had at first any <HI>ideerer</HI> of. I ha' been <HI>i'th'way on't</HI> only three or four days, and I can see, already, <HI>t'an't</HI> to be run up, as a man would run up a rick of hay. Ods woundlikins, Esquire HEATHCOATE, there is no end on't. But howsomever, to shew you that I am not quite a <HI>numscull,</HI> I'll just mention a few matters that I ha' got in memory, which is as thof one were to call it a storehouse to lay by things for future use. In the first place you must under∣stand, that I see plain enough that the first rule of your <HI>bettermost</HI> person is to make a bit of a pleasant grin come into's <HI>phisihog</HI> whenever he first meets any one, as much as to signify, that he knows how to carry his head. In the next
<PB N="162" REF="179"/>place, I find 'tis proper to make up this bit of a grin at first sight, whether you like the man or not. Case why? a gentleman should not shew that he is cuss'd angry, <HI>cept</HI> upon <HI>cassion</HI> of interest, seeing that <HI>pliteness</HI> knows how to smile i'th' face, while it puts finger in pocket. 3dly, I ha' noticed, that the less a man puts <HI>bat</HI> on's head, the better: Case why? it's the sooner doff'd without pinching out the corners; besides which, its <HI>plite</HI> to carry powder and <HI>pummadum</HI> enough to keep the cranium comfort∣able without it. I find a strange <HI>dif∣culty,</HI> Esquire, in getting my foot into the right slide of <HI>pliteness;</HI> for, I per∣ceives head and foot dive together— <HI>out</HI> goes foot, <HI>down</HI> goes head: this is a cuss'd crankum piece of business. Sav∣ing your presence, I can't see the fun of bowing and scraping <HI>too:</HI> nay, ifack, what do I talk of that? some here, at
<PB N="163" REF="180"/><HI>Prudunce Pleace</HI> must needs kiss their hands, and then swing 'em out at the same time. The young <HI>Captain</HI> does this; aye, Esquire, young CARLISLE's hands, head, and heels, all work at once, as smooth and cutely as a bird i'th' air. I'd give almost more than I'm worth, if I could but wriggle out the hinder part o'me, just like Lord BLESSINGBOURNE: when <HI>he</HI> first comes into room, I warrant me, he does no∣thing but <HI>treat</HI> and <HI>vance,</HI> shuffle and cut, and go backwards and forwards, sticking out his rump, and <HI>craning</HI> his fine, thin, long, meagre, nine-haired head, which I find is the <HI>plitest</HI> head a man can have. Yet he knows who's to have a wriggle of the bum, and who not, too: I warrant you he is a cute one: he don't gig and drop his fine <HI>plite</HI> head to every body alike: no, be∣lieve me; he has the measure of what's
<PB N="164" REF="181"/>every man's due, from the Duke to the stable-boy. Down goes his genteel head quite on's breast, to Captain CAR∣LISLE; but when I puts in for a bit of civility, I can't get his neck to move downward half so civilly—Case why? I am but a poor fellow just come among <HI>plite specie.</HI> But I don't allow myself any 'vantages; for though I ha' put on the best suit to my back, <HI>t'an't</HI> at all the thing. Sir ANDREW says my wig is enough to ruin me for ever, if there were nothing else in the way. 'Tis as good a bob as ever was bought, and sits as snugly to <HI>feace;</HI> but, alas! what's a bob where you shan't see any thing under a bag, and that <HI>flourididdled</HI> with rib∣bons and <HI>tossicums?</HI> Young CARLISLE, indeed, lets <HI>his</HI> hair fly to and fro, just as he and the wind can settle it: Case why? he has so much on't, and 'tis so well coloured, and twirls itself off into
<PB N="165" REF="182"/>such ringlets, that <HI>he</HI> is <HI>plite</HI> any way. I ha' bespoke a bag, though I know <HI>afore∣hand</HI> 'twill make a devil o'me, and so I told GAB, who is to ha' the fellow on't. Comfort, tho', that I can't look worse than GAB when I'm bag'd, bag me when they will. For at any rate, I ha' gotten flesh on my feace, and a little jot of colour i'my cheeks to set it off, as well as a stout pair of shoulders; whereas GAB has werretted all the flesh off's bones by larning. Without a word of a joke, Esquire, I don't be∣lieve GAB has a pound of substance on's whole <HI>carkiss;</HI> and as <HI>to's jaws,</HI> has no more meat upon them than upon the bill of chicken: his back is quite a <HI>skelitum;</HI> and though his hair is no bad raven-colour, yet it grows so cuss'd <HI>odd on's head,</HI> and is so <HI>lankum rat-eaten'um,</HI> as a body might
<PB N="166" REF="183"/>say, if they were mind to talk larned, that I would not gee frap of a finger <HI>for's whole growth.</HI> But now I'm upon good breeding, Esquire, I desire to know whether a trick I saw Lord BLES∣SINGBOURNE (who is ever <HI>acold) do</HI> to∣day 'fore men, women, and children, is the <HI>common practise</HI> of your bettermost specie: that is, standing with bumfiddle to fire with coat up, and now and then popping hand <HI>below</HI> waistband. May∣hap, my Lord mayn't be quite so <HI>well</HI> as he would be thereabouts, just at pre∣sent; and it may be a comfort <HI>to'un</HI> to feel now and then how matters go; for which reason I won't venture upon this action till I know whether 'tis a general thing or not. Not that I dislike it, but that just yet it seems aukward to such an ignorant <HI>feller</HI> as I.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="184"/>
Nothing i'th'way of breeding more, at present—But I ha' filled my paper, which I take to be always the <HI>plite</HI> thing. So I rest, at the bottom of the sheet,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLV. Mr. DE GREY to Mr. CARLISLE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Prudence Place.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MY best and dearest CAR∣LISLE must pardon the formality of re∣ceiving an old friend's letter, dated, written, and directed from the same house that contains both the writer and reader of it. The reason is, Prudence Place is at this time so crouded with different sorts of people, and one has so little opportunity to steal leisure for con∣versation of the <HI>higher kind,</HI> that I do not imagine a subject which is at this crisis so very warm at my heart, can be so well or so explicitly handled as upon
<PB N="169" REF="186"/>paper. So much for the apology: I come now to the <HI>matter.</HI>—The days, the months, the years of <HI>tuition</HI> are now past—those seasons, my CLEMENT, in which I had the honour and the happi∣ness (for it was both) to point out to you the paths of propriety and of virtue, are over; for the <HI>Pupil</HI> is even already, at the most early age of twenty-one, be∣come the <HI>Preceptor:</HI> he is the <HI>Tutor of Truth:</HI> he hath already got orphans and widows under his guardianship — the noblest of all guardianship, my CLE∣MENT—the guardianship of <HI>Sensibility.</HI> I <HI>thank</HI> you, Sir, for doing me so much honour. When you left this country for ITALY, I did not imagine there was room for improvements; you were ami∣able, polite, and prudent; as free from pedantry, on the one hand, as from dis∣sipation and the distracted joys of an overgrown boy, on the other. Yet, on
<PB N="170" REF="187"/>my first beholding you, the other day, I was struck with an <HI>additional</HI> finishing, an elegant <HI>compleatness,</HI> which, though not before seeming to be wanted, was, as it <HI>now</HI> appears, absolutely necessary. Forgive the garrulous vanity of an old man, Sir; forgive me, if I lodge, with all the narrative tediousness of age, a little longer on this part of the subject. There are circumstances, which <HI>allow</HI> us to swell out the heart, without making it ridiculous. You, Sir, occasion in me a pride of this nature. Some men's ambition, in the last state of life, is gratified by walking, or rather hobbling, into their fields and gardens, to recognize those flourishing shades which are the produce of their own cul∣tivation. I have heard a veteran neigh∣bour of mine, a thousand times ex∣claim,—See, Mr. DE GREY, how in∣dustrious I have been! that long and
<PB N="171" REF="188"/>lusty range of oaks, extending from this pasture even to the farthermost avenue in the next, did I plant with my own hand.—I remember the day when the whole row (containing, perhaps, two hundred sticks of timber) were so many petty acorns not so big as a walnut; and see, only see how they have sped. I could raise a little navy—verily, neigh∣bour, I could fit out a fleet, with a wood of my own raising.</P>
<P>Such ideas, I own, are not displeas∣ing, CLEMENT: but they are far from being expanded enough, for <HI>my</HI> emula∣tion; my emulation chooses a nobler object, and takes a wider course. My object, Sir, is not circumscribed by any thing within the scope of <HI>inanimate na∣ture;</HI> and though I could be able to look out upon whole forests of my own cultivation, it would not satisfy me.
<PB N="172" REF="189"/>No, Mr. CARLISLE, I have a far <HI>finer</HI> pleasure. I have it to say, that the politest gentleman, and the best man of his age, was once the child of my in∣struction. He was left by that Hea∣ven, which took to itself his natural parents, at an age when gentle treat∣ment makes a parent of any one. I received this dear and delicate trust from the trembling arm of a dying man, and I value it, as a legacy given me in the moment that the soul of a friend was departing. Yes, at such a tender period, was you bequeathed to me, Mr. CAR∣LISLE: my child, LUCIA, was exactly of the same age; and you grew together. The beauty of your forms, like the power of your minds, was similar. I can only say farther, that nature points out to me none of her nice distinctions or partia∣lities. In the hour of your childhood I caressed you both with the same sensi∣bility,
<PB N="173" REF="190"/>and now that you are mature I divide my heart <HI>evenly</HI> between you. But this touch of transport hath seduc∣ed me into a digression. Old folks are, I perceive, on their favourite subject, as tiresome in their writing as in their talking; and therefore they have as few correspondents as hearers. It is time, however, to return to my subject.</P>
<P>On looking back at my account∣book, my dear Mr. CARLISLE, I find that your birth-day hath gone by almost a month. You seem to have forgot that it entitles you to the command and sole disposition of an immense fortune. Mo∣ney was, I am proud to say, never a disputable point with us, except when coercive measures were obliged to be taken in order to force upon you a re∣mittance. This, however, by no means exculpates me for detaining what ought
<PB N="174" REF="191"/>to be in more amiable, as well as more able hands. I reproach myself, when I consider how many cruelties my delay may have been guilty of, Mr. CARLISLE, to those whose fortunes <HI>you</HI> have in trust: methinks, I hear the curse of the wi∣dow, the languishing sigh of sickness, and the murmur of merit in the dark∣some vale: I see, too, the tears stream from the eyes of the fatherless—Oh! for Heaven's sake, my friend, relieve me—rescue me, instantly, from conti∣nuing the injury to that part of your family which Providence hath put un∣der your care.</P>
<P>I shall, most readily, be prepared to render up an ample account of my agency, whenever (and the sooner the better) you will honour me with your appointment.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="192"/>
Thus much for <HI>fortune.</HI> I had it in my mind, CLEMENT, to venture a few sentiments upon <HI>happiness,</HI> which are, by no means, things incompatible, al∣though they are not often inseparable. But any thing I could advance on this head is unnecessary to such a <HI>mind</HI> as your's. With respect to your <HI>heart,</HI> I own, I meditated a few words upon <HI>that</HI> subject also: but I am in great doubt, whether this is the proper point of time to speak to it; yet my propensity is so warm, and the prattling, or rather, at present, scribbling, old man, is so strong, or, to speak more truly, so <HI>feeble</HI> in me, that I can scarce resist.</P>
<P>The interest of your heart must naturally, my dear CLEMENT, be of more concern to me than any other that belongs to you. You are exactly at the age when tenderness falls with the
<PB N="176" REF="193"/>fullest force upon our nature; as you have a form to command love, so have you feeling to return it. That sensibi∣lity, which makes you a parent to the poor, and those accomplishments which endear you to society, in general, will assist and even lead to connexions of a softer kind. I am afraid, it would border a little upon that impertinence which I would avoid, else I should ask you, in the cordiality of my good wishes, whether it is <HI>possible</HI> for so amia∣ble a man, to have passed through <HI>Italy,</HI> and to have resided in the capital of England, (the very court of female beauty) with an inclination unattached, and passions unalarmed. This is too great a paradox for me to credit, even in imagination; and yet, I am <HI>mightily interested</HI> in the question and its an∣swer. Perhaps you will humour an old friend's <HI>caprices,</HI> and, for once, trust
<PB N="177" REF="194"/>him (who can be no rival) with a love∣secret. Suppose you were to steal an hour from the strange mixture of our present family, and scribble a line or two on this matter. I dispatch this by your trusty grey-headed GEOFFREY, who, you know, may be the confident of eve∣ry message that can come from such a master.</P>

<P>YOU confess then that you have written to the detested Marquis: you even avow the sentiments of your letter to him; you own, that they are to <HI>hasten him to England.</HI> But do you think, Sir, I am to be thus treated like a child, and threatened with being chid by that bugbear, <HI>my husband?</HI> or do you imagine, I will ever allow myself to be re-united to him. Preposterous ex∣pectation! No, Mr. CARLISLE, tho' I am a slave to my own passions, I will
<PB N="180" REF="197"/>never more be a slave to those of ano∣ther! You argue in vain about rights and laws and duties—in vain you urge the maxims of the world, and the cus∣tom of nations. I have lived so long under the Italian heavens, that I have forgot—utterly forgot—the colder atmo∣phere of cloudy England. I have learn∣ed to follow my feelings, and to abhor chains that were forced upon me by pa∣ternal authority. You direct me to the sacred circle of gold upon my fingers; you call it the caestus of fidelity. I grew enraged to consider a man, scarce more than twenty, thus coldly argue upon a tender offer of no contemptible passion. My <HI>pride</HI> took the alarm, and I tore your epistle, and threw the ring from my finger at the same time. I stampt upon it with indignation. Miss LASCELLES appeared, and, as if you had pre-instructed her, she acted upon
<PB N="181" REF="198"/>the occasion as the very priestess of pie∣ty. "Fie, my dear Marchioness, (said she, folding her palms together in the true conventicle manner) these outrages are ever dreadful, but when they arise from so bad a <HI>cause,</HI> what strength of terms can sufficiently reprobate them! Consider the reserve and decorum of your sex!—consider the consequences!— consider your character!"</P>
<P>Ah frigid insolent! is this the mode of British hospitality? Do you <HI>lesson</HI> those whom you protect? and do you, never∣theless, boast of your island as an asy∣lum for the wretched, and for the stranger? Where are your sanctua∣ries for an unhappy woman—where is your courtesy for tenderness and the wounded heart in despair? But you northern Islanders grow upon too frozen
<PB N="182" REF="199"/>a soil to feel the power of sentiment, which glows nearer to the sun.</P>
<P>The subject must be hateful to you, and I will quit it: but, still, Mr. CAR∣LISLE, something is due to my <HI>pride,</HI> whatever is denied to my <HI>passion.</HI> I will not stay here to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the triumph of those, who have cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ty because they have not hearts. Miss LASCELLES hath, of late, assumed a language of lofty advice to which I am not accustomed. She pi∣ties me—she is sorry—she wishes me well—she will do every thing warranted <HI>by discretion</HI>—she wishes Captain CAR∣LISLE and I had met sooner. The af∣fair is delicate—she hopes that pru∣dence will prevail.</P>
<P>Ah! CARLISLE, that my extrava∣gance of affection should have reduced
<PB N="183" REF="200"/>me to this! Oh! that I could change— Oh! that I could reverse the passion—I would sacrifice fifty years of my life to hate you.</P>
<P>Ah! what have I said? To what violation of the truth hath my passion led me? No, my CARLISLE, no; I would not wish to hate you—wretched as I am, I would not even wish to love you less. Though the agony is extreme, there are moments of transport, known only to bosoms like mine, that repay me for it. Hate you—O heavens! what a word! what an idea to mix with that, which dresses up the irre∣sistible CARLISLE! Pardon the blot∣tings which are staining this part of my paper. They are made by tears that shew at least some tincture of virtue. In other circumstances you say it would
<PB N="184" REF="201"/>have been your pride to have courted the softness which is now so pressingly offered. How then is it possible <HI>my</HI> eyes should be dry, when I perceive those circumstances so unlikely ever to hap∣pen? Yet, I cannot lose the idea—I cannot disengage myself from the delu∣sion, though I know it to be no more. Persist then in your virtue, Sir; but de∣ny me not the little gale of pleasure that blows from fancy. Continue to let me hope—continue to correspond— only condescend to allow me the flattery of thinking I am not hated by the loveliest of men, and I will sustain any thing for his sake. I will remain quiet where I am, and sit composed under the frown of <HI>virtue without temptation.</HI> I will bear the thought of even seeing again the Marquis. I will do any thing you would have me, if you will still
<PB N="185" REF="202"/>continue to say you do not utterly exe∣crate me, for a guilt occasioned by ten∣derness.</P>

<PB N="186" REF="203"/>
<HEAD>LETTER XLVII. Captain CARLISLE to Mr. LASCELLES.</HEAD>
<P>MY dilemma is even greater than before. The inclosed, from Mr. DE GREY, is even more perplexing than that which you transmitted from the Marchioness. Both perplex my ima∣gination, in what manner to answer them. Mr. DE GREY'S reason for in∣quiring into the state of my affections, is, evidently, for fear my return to Prudence Place, (now that his daugh∣ter is in the full bloom of her sense and beauty there) should inspire me with a passion that, he knows, would terminate in despair; apprised too as he is of her engagement to Mr. MEDWAY.
<PB N="187" REF="204"/>It is very natural for him to imagine I should fall into this charming tempta∣tion; so that this is a little generous stratagem (under the guise of ordinary curiosity) to prevent the mortification, and the misery in time. Mr. MEDWAY is so singular a man, that, if he did not constantly assure me almost every time he sees me, that his passion runs before the wind, I should scarce credit, that a person whom I hardly ever saw speak to Miss DE GREY, should have made such a progress in her affections. It is plain, however, now from her <HI>own</HI> conduct, that she is fervently at∣tached; for her address, air, manner, and whole deportment to me, are utter∣ly changed. I am no longer delighted by that lovely affability, which, though playful, was ever corrected by modesty. She no longer consults my taste, which she was wont to flatter, about her
<PB N="188" REF="205"/>dress, her ornaments, and ten thousand innocent trifles, that, nevertheless, (tri∣fles as they are) make up the chief en∣dearment of domestic society. She speaks in form; her eye is averted; her sentiments sound <HI>studied.</HI> We are no longer like CLEMENT and LUCIA, who employed their infant cares in rearing the <HI>same bower.</HI> Mr. DE GREY'S letter therefore, joined to Mr. MEDWAY'S assurances, and Miss DE GREY'S beha∣viour point out to me, pretty plainly, what kind of an answer it is proper for me to make to the former. I am some∣what consoled to reflect, that, even in my most familiar moments, I never en∣tered flatly into overtures with LUCIA, so that I cannot create any uneasiness in her bosom upon my account; for, had that been the case, her sensibility is so uncommon, LASCELLES, she would have felt for <HI>my</HI> disappointment, amidst
<PB N="189" REF="206"/>all the gaity of her own successes. Since <HI>her</HI> heart is happily engaged (if she <HI>thinks</HI> it so, it certainly <HI>is</HI> so) it now becomes a duty, more than ever, in me, to <HI>conceal</HI> the feelings of <HI>mine.</HI> Whatever be the violence of my pas∣sion, it has no right to be troublesome to any other bosom: and I was never able to account for that cowardly con∣duct, which induces us to embitter the joy of a rival and a mistress because they were more fortunate or happy than ourselves. Beside, that such complaints never awaken more than compassion which is not desirable, they aggravate disappointment till it rushes upon dis∣grace. But, methinks I hear you re∣tort upon me: "Why trouble <HI>me</HI> with your misery then, CLEMENT?" Ah LASCELLES, we are not such abstracted beings as to lock up our sentiments, either of joy or sorrow, in absolute so∣litude. The very thoughts would stag∣nate,
<PB N="190" REF="207"/>by such means. On some gene∣rous breast every man must, by the ve∣ry gravitation of his nature, lean for support in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> misery. Every man culls from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> species his congenial counterp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> and it is as necessary to have a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> our confidence, as a mistress <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> tenderness. Away with those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> minds, which feel an ava∣rice <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> their noblest feelings. Plu∣rali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of friendships may, perhaps, like plu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity of lovers, be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>admissible; but, surely, it is very possiole to be fond of one mistress and faithful to one friend, at the same time. Oh! Mr. LASCELLES, what hourly occasion is there for one or other of these bless∣ings! As joys and sorrows alternately prevail, how soothing is the congratu∣lating hand and chearful voice to the one! and the gentle tear, or sympathiz∣ing sigh to the other! Ah enchanting
<PB N="191" REF="208"/>communication! without which, even transport must lie languishing at the heart! and in <HI>misfortune</HI> the wretch who is se∣parated from his species, and sits loose to the kindness of an individual, shall, like a wounded deer, lament his disas∣ter without pity, and die forlorn.</P>
<P>With respect to the Marchioness, I am every way so circumstanced that I am puzzled even to reply to her. It would be too much like affectation, and a kind of male prudery in me to say, that, if matters were in another channel, I should not be flattered by this over∣bearing tide of tenderness in so beauti∣ful an object. Heaven knows I am not <HI>insensible</HI> to the charms of beauty. Some∣thing that at this moment presses hard upon my heart, convinces me I am not. But situated as I am, how is it possible to receive such a letter as her last with∣out
<PB N="192" REF="209"/>distress? Believe me, LASCELLES, I feel no elation at the compliment of so distinguished a preference, although I acknowledge the Marchioness to be as you say, with your favourite Yorick, "amongst the first order of fine forms." I acknowledge too her command over the passions: her fire; her eloquence; the delicacy of her shape; the dignity of her deportment: yet, I feel nothing but anxiety at her present conduct. The reason you will say, is, my secret attachment to <HI>another.</HI> Be it so. Yet, were even that barrier removed, I should, I am positive, still be unhappy, and not flattered, by the attentions of the charm∣ing Marchioness. You are an animated man, and no doubt call me a cold∣blooded creature! By no means. My passions are as lively as they generally are in <HI>any</HI> bosom at my age, but, per∣haps, my <HI>taste of voluptuousness</HI> differs a
<PB N="193" REF="210"/>little from the general juvenile idea. I have a great pleasure in pleasing <HI>my own mind:</HI> nay, I have a great <HI>interest</HI> in so doing; whenever I have done wrong, I have always found that the pain result∣ing from it, is too heavy to be counter∣balanced by the pleasure which pro∣duced it. I have my wayward propen∣sities as well as another: a whim hath often seized me by the heart, and I have at all events indulged it. For <HI>the time,</HI> it was extasy, and, for ought I can tell, the extasy was heightened by a sense of the <HI>venture</HI> at which the deed was done. Presently (and indeed close upon the heel of it) comes the <HI>per con∣tra</HI> of the action, if you will suffer me to borrow a term from trade. My frolic being over, memory is command∣ed, by a power we cannot resist, to <HI>re∣trace</HI> it; and if in going through the mazes of the past I met any thing
<PB N="194" REF="211"/>wrong, or uneven, against the cause of that integrity which I profess to love, the thorns are from that moment in my bosom, and for so much mirth, I am rewarded seven-fold in misery. I am so constructed that I can no more stand against the rebuff of a blush on my own cheek than against the thunder of a cannon: the sigh which my weak∣ness may at any time have extorted from another bosom, agonizes my own; and a tear, which I once, very unde∣signedly, drew from an innocent crea∣ture, haunts me from place to place, and the precious drop, for it was wrung from the eyes of <HI>Lucia,</HI> is still trembling in my imagination.</P>
<P>I have enlarged upon this subject, because my behaviour might want (to your fancy) an apology. That people do not all act on the same principle, is,
<PB N="195" REF="212"/>because they do not all analyze the real cause of that anguish which so often treads upon pleasure. There is, me∣thinks, one simple law, that comprizes all the wisdom of the prophets, and all the sagacity of philosophers: I feel it better than I can describe it; but to give you some idea of it, I shall just lay it down as a note, that, whenever a man is upon the edge of an enjoyment, (let it relate to whatever part of indulgence it may) he has only to consider, whe∣ther it will not, sooner or latter, be re∣turned by <HI>more</HI> than an equal misery: if, however, even the prospect of <HI>greater pain</HI> does not deter, let him hazard the joy: then while the <HI>actual agony</HI> is full upon him, let him again compare the <HI>actual pleasure:</HI> after this, his heart must be very perverse, and his head very much intoxicated, if for the future his pleasures are not such as will not
<PB N="196" REF="213"/><HI>burt</HI> him after they are over. Innocent pleasures are, indeed, <HI>never</HI> over: they spring directly from the soul; and like that, they are immortal. Like mercy too, they are "twice blest:" they de∣light us while they are acting, and con∣science makes them sacred in reflec∣tion.</P>
<P>It is upon this principle I am pro∣ceeding with regard to AUGUSTA. She is the wife of a man to whom I had the honour to tender what he reckoned an obligation. This makes his property more especially sacred to me. She is, also, the wife of a man whom, not∣withstanding the roughness of his man∣ners, I believe to be valuable. She is <HI>in trust</HI>—In short she is every thing that she should <HI>not be</HI> to make a mi∣stress of; and as I told you before, my <HI>taste of voluptuousness</HI> must have the pre∣sent
<PB N="197" REF="214"/>circumstances wholly inverted — that is to say—she must be unmarried, and <HI>averse</HI> to marriage; unconnected, and unclaimed in the way of connexion, and I, unattached too—before I could congratulate myself upon the conquest of this flower of Italy.</P>
<P>Yet, till the Marquis comes, for Heaven's sake use every method to soothe, and quiet her: do not advise your sister to oppose her in the heat of her sentiments. She is too furious for admonition. Her imagination is too much in its hey dey. Her passions will die of themselves; and she will conso∣lidate perhaps, after all, into a regular character. Her situation with you is so very delicate, that I know your sister is in a dilemma; but still, AU∣GUSTA has many virtues. I have seen a thousand instances of her benevolence:
<PB N="198" REF="215"/>the Italian peasants bless her door, and kiss the very threshold of it, because imprinted by her footsteps. She is at this time under the influence of <HI>Fancy;</HI> it is a sort of feverish fit that attacks smartly at first, and will away again. The handsome creature is but just touching nineteen. She is a child, my dear LASCELLES, and this truant dispo∣sition is a trick of the leading string: without parents and of a vigorous ima∣gination, she is yet, as to human life, in the nursery. No more, my friend— think not of her as of one abandoned: that is not the case. As to her glowing language, let not that displease your sister, though unaccustomed to her ear. The Italian women know nothing of that reserve and pathetic bashfulness, which guards the expressions of the Bri∣tish fair. They speak freely and flow∣ingly—the Marchioness adds to the
<PB N="199" REF="216"/>custom, even the ardours of <HI>constitu∣tion.</HI> But, indeed, she is not a base character—Once it is said the Marquis in his violence struck her. Her pride was hurt. She thought it beneath the dignity of the man who had figured at the front of an army—she never forgave it—'twas wrong. But who hath not a fault to be forgiven? Fare∣well. I have written myself into some composure, and that will plead my ex∣cuse for having so long intruded.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLVIII. Miss DE GREY to Miss LASCELLES.</HEAD>
<P>SURELY every day is com∣missioned to present some new mystery, and no hour decreed to unfold or ex∣plain it! My father whispered, as I sat at dinner yesterday, that he had a little private conversation for me, and would contrive an opportunity very soon to chat with me. You know his me∣thod of treating his children, CARO∣LINE. Towards the close of the even∣ing (when Lord and Lady BLESSING∣BOURNE were airing, Mrs. HEWSON at her looking-glass, where she is prac∣tising breeding, Mr. MEDWAY at the
<PB N="201" REF="218"/>river with his fishing-rod, and Mr. CAR∣LISLE at his writing-desk) we found the leisure we wanted, and walked into the garden together. We will settle a little while in this very bower, my dear, says my father: 'tis as pretty and cooling as any in the garden.</P>
<P>Oh, CAROLINE, it was the bower of CLEMENT and LUCIA!</P>
<P>Yes, Sir, replied I; it is very pretty and cooling, indeed.</P>
<P>I suppose, LUCIA, your fellow-la∣bourer who helped to make it has not paid it a visit since his return. Such humble shades must yield to the spices of Italy. He has, to be sure, forgot an arbour of mere English hawthorns and woodbines.</P>
<P>I — I — believe he has, Sir.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="219"/>
A-propos, LUCIA, do you hold in the same mind still? Do you still think him the <HI>incomparable</HI> CARLISLE? Pru∣dence Place can boast just at pre∣sent, <HI>several</HI> brilliant men. We have the laughter-loving Sir ANDREW, of a ve∣ry agreeable person. We have the man∣ly Mr. MEDWAY, odd, but amiable. Putting these both against Mr. CAR∣LISLE, is he still the <HI>superlative</HI> degree? There are two to one LUCIA. What say you?</P>
<P>I believe they have all their merit, Sir.</P>
<P>But is their merit perfectly equal in <HI>your</HI> opinion, my dear?</P>
<P>As to that, Sir, I—should suppose— no doubt—that is—in short, Sir, as I have not known them all the same time—
<PB N="203" REF="220"/>as one can judge more of intimates than casual acquaintances—</P>
<P>You prefer CLEMENT, I suppose?</P>
<P>I have known him the longest, Sir.</P>
<P>MEDWAY, my dear, has great con∣nexions.</P>
<P>Sir?</P>
<P>Sir ANDREW has good humour, and will be heir to Lord BLESSINGBOURNE.</P>
<P>Sir —?</P>
<P>But CARLISLE is the more accom∣plished gentleman.</P>
<P>Most certainly he is, Sir, <HI>beyond comparison.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="221"/>
Do you think <HI>beyond comparison,</HI> LU∣CIA?</P>
<P>Sir—?</P>
<P>I say, my dear LUCIA, do you real∣ly think—that—that?</P>
<P>Bless me, Sir, how faint the air gets when the breeze falls, at this season of the year—</P>
<P>Yonder comes GEOFFRY.</P>
<P>From Mr. CARLISLE; perhaps upon private business—I will, if you please, withdraw, Sir.</P>
<P>If the heat is troublesome, pray do, my dear.</P>
<P>Very troublesome, indeed, Sir—Lord bless me! there is not a breath of wind.
<PB N="205" REF="222"/>As sure as can be, there is a tempest in the skies.</P>
<P>Thus ended our dialogue—What does it mean, CAROLINE? I never was more confused in my life. What could old GEOFFRY be coming for? The old fellow, who only wishes himself young again to dispatch with more haste the commands of his master, quite ran on the occasion.</P>
<P>On my return into the house, I met Mr. MEDWAY with an handkerchief full of fish, and in the highest degree pleas∣ed with his success. By way of courtesy <HI>en passant,</HI> I told him, he must certainly carry a <HI>charm</HI> about him to attract so many fish out of the water in so little a time. Upon which he caught hold of my wrist, and, after looking round the
<PB N="206" REF="223"/>room to see if any body was present— hush—hush—for God's sake, child— walls have eyes—and worms have ears, as I always told you.</P>
<P>From this, and some other strange things, I have seen in this man, I am convinced his head is not exactly as it should be.</P>
<P>Not a view of CARLISLE all this morning since breakfast. No sollicita∣tion to sing, to touch the guittar, to walk in the garden, to count the fruit, to read Pope, to—to—to—</P>
<P>It is very barbarous he should all at once take such a dislike to me!</P>
<P>I wish Italy had been far enough be∣fore he had seen it. Pray, my dear,
<PB N="207" REF="224"/>are the ladies so <HI>very</HI> beautiful in that country? Towards <HI>Rome</HI> for instance! I have been looking into my father's library for a sort of <HI>history,</HI> and <HI>manners</HI> of that country. Not, indeed, that I am concerned in the matter; but yet, if any thing of this kind happens to fall in your way, you may purchase and send it me by the first con∣veyance.</P>

<P>WE got, without mischance, to the Abbey. I beg to know whether you have considered the subject we dis∣coursed upon. Sir ANDREW is no mean match, Mr. DE GREY. He will, one day, be Earl of BLESSINGBOURNE, for which change of his name, I have a peremptory command in my Will. If you send me word <HI>you</HI> are satisfied as to the matter, I will transmit directions for him to think more <HI>particularly</HI> of the young Lady, whose good qualities
<PB N="210" REF="227"/>my Lady and I have determined with∣in ourselves to be equivalent to want of title, and that is certainly saying a great deal. Sir ANDREW is worthy, though he is too great a laugher, and he will make a good husband. Your offer of forty thousand pounds with Miss DE GREY is liberal: half that with a coronet would be sufficient. How∣ever, if there are honours on one side, it reflects dignity on both. If she mar∣ries Sir ANDREW she stands a chance of being a Countess; to which brilliant probability I will add the fellow sum to your's down, two thousand pounds worth of diamonds; a thousand pounds for a wedding dinner, and the hand∣somest set of cream-colours, with sil∣ver trappings, and the BLESSINGBOURNE crest engraven thereon.

<HEAD>LETTER LI. Mr. LASCELLES to Captain CARLISLE.</HEAD>
<P>HOW pitiable it is, my dear CARLISLE, that you should be so cir∣cumstanced as to find it utterly impos∣sible to return the extatic fondness of this bewitching woman! She is abso∣lutely an angel. Some new dresses have lately been put on, and she sets them off with such an elegance, such a taste, such a <HI>naiveté,</HI> it is impossible to look at her without an ejaculation of plea∣sure and admiration. Allowing all your arguments their full force, I must still confess, there is a something cold and icy about <HI>your</HI> heart, that cannot be
<PB N="216" REF="233"/>melted by such a blaze of beauty—es∣pecially as the lady is so perfectly <HI>will∣ing,</HI> and not at all unreasonably <HI>nice.</HI> She loves your person well enough to take it on <HI>your own terms:</HI> she does not pre∣tend to capitulate: the citadel is your own, and you may do what <HI>you will</HI> with it. Oh—said she, the other day (while the tears were streaming from her lovely eyes)—oh, that I could see him but <HI>one</HI> moment in <HI>every</HI> day, I would be content with annihilation for the rest of the twenty-four hours. By Heavens, CARLISLE, if any woman half so beautiful had avowed such a sentiment in <HI>my</HI> favour, I would have shewn my gratitude for it at the price of my existence—but you, on the contrary, though as virtuous as a saint, are as frigid as a Freezelander. I ques∣tion whether you ever approached the
<PB N="217" REF="234"/>lips of this lovely one since they first de∣clared a passion for you. It requires, I confess, all the elaborate excuses you have made, to wipe off the imputation of an insensible; and even after all your pains, I freely tell you, that I think you are too scrupulous upon this occa∣sion. I speak frankly, out of pity to the Marchioness, and for <HI>your pleasure.</HI> Ad∣mitting your passion for Miss DE GREY to be ever so great, what, I wonder, has <HI>that</HI> to do with a snug convenient beauty, by way of, <HI>my friend in a corner,</HI> at ano∣ther quarter of the world? Your no∣tions are absolutely antediluvian. I do not know another man in the world, who would not <HI>leap</HI> at your situation. In the name of pleasure then, make the best of it! I thought at first as you do, but I speak now upon mature deli∣beration. There is no doubt but the Marchioness would change her name,
<PB N="218" REF="235"/>live quietly in the place you provide for her, be happy as if in Heaven to get a sight of you once a fortnight, and there would be an end of the thing. Do then, let me advise you, put a pe∣riod to these complaints; open the cage of the beautiful prisoner, and set the pretty little heart, that is now beating as it were at the wires till it pants again, perfectly at ease. It is with great dif∣ficulty I keep her from writing to you every day. The idea of the Marquis sets her already raving; but I cannot by any means draw from her, nor can my sister, any account of her family, sup∣posed to be in town. She says, they would force her again to the arms of the detested Marquis. But I have pro∣posed a proper salvo for all those sores, and, if you have the least lively spark of the young man, or of merry human
<PB N="219" REF="236"/>nature in you, you will not neglect it. Compliments to our friend Sir ANDREW.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LII. Captain CARLISLE to G. LASCELLES, Esq.</HEAD>
<P>YOUR letter has not been an hour in my hand, and, although my heart was full of <HI>other</HI> matter, I have now neither ear nor pen for any thing but an answer to it. Do you know, in the first place, that I looked at your seal, and at your superscription, and at the very <HI>cut of your letters,</HI> before I would credit the thing to be your's? In this age of <HI>forgery,</HI> I was in good hope, somebody had made free with my friend. But as it appears that the letter did ab∣solutely proceed from <HI>you, I</HI> must pro∣ceed to an explicit reply.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="238"/>
Make a prostitute of the poor girl, Mr. LASCELLES? Seek out a conve∣nient apartment, and compel the charm∣ing eyes, which you say <HI>now</HI> weep with love, grow wild with the sparklings of rage and despair? What, Sir, would you wish me to seclude her from all va∣luable society, and to sink her from a Marchioness of the first figure and fashion, to a mere mistress—from a young, elegant woman, to a scorned, abandoned daughter of the brothel! Is this the method in which you would have me return my compliment, for a long, a weary, an hapless, and an un∣fortunate journey of a thousand miles? However misplaced the affection she is pleased to bestow upon me, and how∣ever impossible it is for me to reward it, I am still bound to her even for her very misfortune. It is my <HI>fate,</HI> and not <HI>me,</HI> that declines what, in some
<PB N="222" REF="239"/>cases, might have been my greatest blessing. Surely, Mr. LASCELLES, I owe her gratitude of a very different complexion from that blushless one, you recommend. My heart bleeds for her. From <HI>me</HI> she should claim an at∣tentive anxiety how to <HI>recompense</HI> the throbbings in her bosom; the most in∣dustrious care to reconcile her again to her husband, to contrive means of heal∣ing up any breach, which my unfortu∣nate acquaintance with that gentleman may have occasioned. These are the services she should expect from me, and to offer these is at once my study, and my effort. But I will not believe you serious; or, if you are, your compassion has hurried you into a precipitancy, that only wants shewing you, to be repented of.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="240"/>
This, my dear LASCELLES, is as∣suredly the case. Besides which, de∣pend upon it, you have <HI>mistaken</HI> the Marchioness. She could not stoop to the ignominious terms you have pro∣posed to me for her. If she <HI>really</HI> loves, there must be some degree of refine∣ment in the partiality; and believe me, LASCELLES, many a woman has felt a secret predilection in favour of a man, who would start with hor∣ror from an act of <HI>predetermined</HI> per∣fidy. If it were not for the appearance of an implied compliment to <HI>myself,</HI> I should not at all scruple to say, I be∣lieve, any partiality, AUGUSTA may have, unluckily, conceived in my fa∣vour, proceeds, wholly, from some imaginary <HI>virtues</HI> which she is pleased to think I possess. I dare swear she is taken by certain qualities in your friend, which (as <HI>she</HI> has enriched and magni∣fied
<PB N="224" REF="241"/>them) appear to <HI>her</HI> deserving esteem. Upon <HI>this</HI> principle, you have, indeed, proposed an <HI>effectual plan</HI> for making her <HI>detest</HI> me. To discolour the image she has flatteringly dressed up, by placing in its stead a seducer and ingrate, might perhaps prove a successful remedy: but this, my dear LASCELLES, would be pur∣chasing aversion more fatally than any thing that can reasonably arise out of the partiality itself. No, no, my friend.</P>
<P>Enough however has been urged: you are convinced, and, therefore, you are dear as you ever were, to</P>

<P>Sir ANDREW returns your devoir. He is as merry as ridicule can make
<PB N="225" REF="242"/>him; his present objects, now his uncle is gone, are two foolish bumpkin bro∣thers, and a handsome simpleton of a wife to one of them.</P>
