<HEAD>To DAVID GARRICK, Esq.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE author of the following Eclogue, having requested my assist∣ance to introduce it to the world; it was with more indignation than surprize I was informed of your having used your extensive influence over the press to prevent its being advertised in the News-papers. How are you, Sir, concerned in the Lamentation of <HI>Roscius</HI> for his <HI>Nyky?</HI> Does your modesty think no man entitled to the appellation of Roscius but yourself? Does Nyky resemble any nick-named fa∣vourite of yours? Or does it follow, that if you have cherished an un∣worthy favourite, you must bear too near a resemblance to him? <HI>Qui capit ille facit;</HI> beware of self-accusation, where others bring no charge! Or, granting you right in these particulars, by what right or privilege do you, Sir, set up for a licenser of the press? That you have long successfully usurped that privilege, to swell both your fame and fortune, is well known. Not the puffs of the quacks of Bays∣water and Chelsea are so numerous and notorious: but by what au∣thority do you take upon you to shut up the general channel, in which writers usher their performances to the public? If they at∣tack either your talents or your character, <HI>in utrumque paratus,</HI> you are armed to defend yourself. You have, besides your ingenuous countenance and conscious innocence; <HI>Nil conscire sibi, nulla pal∣lescere culpa;</HI> Besides this brazen bulwark, I say, you have a ready pen and a long purse. The press is open to the one, and the bar is ever ready to open with the other. For a poor author, not a printer will publish a paragraph, not a pleader will utter a quib∣ble. You have then every advantage in the contest: It is need∣less, therefore, to endeavour to intimidate your antagonists by countenancing your retainers to threaten their lives! These in∣timidations, let me tell you Sir, have an ugly, suspicious look. They are besides needless; the <HI>genus irritabile vatum</HI> want no such personal provocations; Heaven knows, the life of a play-wright, like that of a spider, is in a state of the most slender dependency. It is well for my rhiming friend that his hangs not on so slight a thread. He thinks, nevertheless, that he has reason to complain, as well as the publick, of your having long preferred the flimzy, translated, patch'd-up and mis-altered pieces of your favourite com∣pilers, to the arduous attempts at originality of writers, who have no personal interest with the manager. In particular, he thinks
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
the two pieces, you are projecting to get up next winter, for the emolument of your favorite in disgrace, or to reimburse yourself the money, you may have advanced him, might, for the present at least, be laid aside.</P>
<P>But you will ask me, perhaps, in turn, Sir, what right I have to interfere with the business of other people, or with yours? I will answer you. It is because I think your business, as patentee of a theatre-royal, is not so entirely yours, but that the publick also have some concern in it. You, Sir, indeed have long be∣haved as if you thought the town itself a purchased appurtenance to the theatre; but, tho' the scenes and machines are yours; nay, tho' you have even found means to make comedians and poets your property; it should be with more caution than you practise, that you extend your various arts to make so scandalous a proper∣ty of the publick.</P>
<P>Again I answer, it is because I have some regard for my friend, and as much for myself, whom you have treated as ill perhaps as you have done any other writer; while under your auspices, some of the persons stigmatised by the satirist, have frequently combined to do me the most essential injury. But <HI>nemo me impurè lacessit.</HI> Not that I mean now to enter into particulars which may be thought to relate too much to myself and too little to the publick. When I shall have leisure to draw a faithful portraiture of Mr. Garrick, not only from his behaviour to me in particular, but from his conduct towards poets, players and the town in general, I doubt not to convince the most partial of his admirers that he hath accumulated a fortune, as manager, by the meanest and most me∣retricious devices, and that the theatrical props, which have long supported his exalted reputation, as an actor, have been raised on the ruins of the English stage.</P>
<P>In the mean time, I leave you to amuse yourself with the follow∣ing jeu d'esprit of my friend; hoping, tho' it be a severe correction for the errours of your past favouritism, it may prove a salutary guide to you for the future. With regard to the mode of its publica∣tion I hope also to stand excused with the reader for thus interposing to defeat the success of those arts, which you so unfairly practise to prevent, from reaching the public eye, whatever is disagreeable to your own.</P>

There is the less reason to fear this, as he hath already exceeded even Mr.—'s activity in King Richard.

<P>A Certain circumstance,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Viz. The gross publication of a direct, abominable charge against ROSCIUS, in the Public Ledger of June 18.</NOTE> to which the author of the foregoing piece was an utter stranger, having happened about the time of its publication, and given rise to rumours equally false and foreign to the writer; it appears that Roscius, or some of his friends, was pleased to insert the following queries in the Morning Chronicle of July 2d.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>CANDOUR presents her compliments to Mr.—, she begs his pardon—to Dr.— <HI>Kenrick,</HI> and desires to ask him a few simple questions; to which, if he be the <HI>Plain-dealer</HI> he pretends, he will give a plain and direct answer.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Query</HI> I. Whether you are not the author of the eclogue, entitled, <HI>Love in the Suds,</HI> as well as of the letter prefixed to it?</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. Whether you did not mean, though you have artfully evaded the law, by affecting the translation of a classical cento, to throw out the most scandalous insinuations against the character of Roscius?</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. Whether you were not likewise the author of an infamous, anonymous paragraph in a public paper; for which that paper is un∣der a just prosecution?</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. Whether you have not openly acknowledged notwithstand∣ing, that you really entertained a very different opinion of Roscius?</ITEM>
<ITEM>V. Whether any cause of dispute, that might subsist between you and Roscius, can authorize so cruel, so unmanly an attack?</ITEM>
<ITEM>VI. Whether the brother of Roscius did not personally wait on you to require, in his name, the satisfaction of a gentleman, which you refused him?</ITEM>
</LIST>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>CANDOUR.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="28" REF="22"/>To these queries, the author judged it expedient to make the fol∣lowing reply in the same paper of July 4th.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To CANDOUR.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Though I think your signature a misnomer, to shew that I am no stranger to the name and quality you assume, I shall not stand on the punctilio of your being an <HI>anonymous</HI> querist; but answer your several questions explicitly.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. I am the author of the eclogue you mention.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. I did not mean to throw out the <HI>most</HI> scandalous insinuations on the character of Roscius, nor any insinuation <HI>more</HI> scandalous than his conduct. How far that has been so, he knows best, and is left to make the application.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. An <HI>infamous</HI> paragraph I <HI>cannot</HI> write; and an <HI>anonymous</HI> one I <HI>will not</HI> write, to prejudice my greatest enemy. As to that in ques∣tion, I have not, to this hour, even seen it. CALUMNY I <HI>detest;</HI> but I think <HI>vice</HI> should be exposed to <HI>infamy;</HI> nor have I so much <HI>false delicacy</HI> as to conceive, it should be treated with <HI>tenderness</HI> in propor∣tion as it is <HI>abominable.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. I have not acknowledged that I entertain a <HI>very different</HI> opinion of Roscius; on the contrary, I declare, that I entertain a <HI>very indifferent</HI> opinion of him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>V. As to the cause of our dispute, I should be very ready to submit it to the publick, were I egotist enough to think it deserved their at∣tention.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VI. The brother of Roscius <HI>did personally wait</HI> on me, to desire I would meet "him, the said Roscius, who would bring a friend with him; I being at liberty to do the same;" but as nothing of time, place, or weapon was mentioned, I did not look on this message as a challenge; nor well could I, as I never heard of requiring <HI>gentleman's satisfaction</HI> by <HI>letter of attorney,</HI> and the professed end of our meeting
<PB N="29" REF="23"/>
turned merely on a matter of business.—It is possible, indeed, the messenger, otherwise instructed, might <HI>imagine</HI> it such, especially as, it seems, his head has teemed with nothing but challenges and duels, since his magnanimous monomachy with one of his brother Roscius's candle-snuffers.—That Roscius himself, however, did not mean to send me a challenge, is plain, from his solliciting afterwards by letter, a conference in the presence only of a common friend to both: a request that would have been complied with, had not he thought proper, in a most ungentleman-like manner, to make a confidant, in the mean time, of a booby of a bookseller, who had the folly and impudence to declare that he would, on <HI>his</HI> [Roscius's] account, <HI>take an opportu∣nity</HI> to do <HI>me</HI> some desperate mischief.—Lest I should be yet suppo∣sed, from the purport of this last query, to have any fear of a personal encounter with the doughty Roscius, I require only that it may be on an equal footing. I am neither so extravagantly fond of life, nor think myself so consequential in it, as to fear the end of it from such an antagonist; nor, to say the truth, should I have any qualms of conscience, if nothing less will satisfy him, about putting an end to so insignificant a being as his: but, as "the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong," it is but right to provide against a mishap. Roscius has a large fortune, and little or no family to leave it to: I have a large family, and little or no fortune to leave it. Let Roscius but previously settle <HI>only half</HI> his estate on my heirs, on condition that <HI>he</HI> deprives them of a protector, and I will meet him to-morrow, and engage at his own weapons, not only him, but his brother George into the bargain.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The above pleasantry being misconstrued by some of Roscius's friends to the disadvantage of the author, the latter thought himself under the necessity of seriously acquainting the former, of his being ready, as he is, at any time, to give him such sa∣tisfaction as a gentleman, who supposes himself injured, has a right to require.</NOTE></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>And now, Madam CANDOUR, give me leave to ask <HI>you</HI> a question or two, in my turn.</P>
<LIST>
<PB N="30" REF="24"/>
<ITEM><HI>Qu.</HI> I. Whether, from many gross instances of misbehaviour, <HI>Ros∣cius</HI> hath not long had sufficient reason to suspect the detestable cha∣racter of <HI>Nyky.?</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. Whether, therefore, granting Roscius to be himself <HI>immaculate,</HI> he is excusable for his notorious partialities to such a character?</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. Whether he has any right to complain of unjust severity, in being ludicrously reproached with such partialities, by a writer, whom he hath treated, even in favour of that very wretch, with dis∣respect, with insolence, with injustice.</ITEM>

<CLOSER><SIGNED>W. KENRICK.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Instead of <HI>candidly</HI> replying, however, to the above three queries, a very difficult task, indeed, to Roscius, he caused the Court of King's Bench to be moved for a rule to shew cause, why leave should not be given him to file an information against the author for a libel: which being granted of course, the same was exultingly anounced in the fol∣lowing paragraphs inserted in all the news-papers:</P>
<Q><P>Yesterday morning Mr. Dunning made a motion in the Court of King's Bench, for a rule to shew cause why an information should not be laid against the author of Love in the Suds. When the court was pleased to grant a rule for the first day of next term. The poem was read in court by the Clerk of the Crown, and afforded no small diversion when it came to that part which reflects upon a certain Chief Justice, who was present all the time.</P>
<P>Besides Mr. Wallace and Mr. Dunning, who are employed by a greatactor, in his prosecution of some detestable charges which have been lately urged with <HI>as much folly as wickedness</HI> against his charac∣ter, Mr. Murphy and Mr. Mansfield are also engaged, and the cause now becomes a matter of much expectation with the publick.</P></Q>
<P>To these paragraphs the author judged it necessary to make the following reply, in the above-mentioned Morning Chronicle; al∣most all the rest of the news-papers, by the indefatigable industry
<PB N="31" REF="25"/>
and powerful influence of Roscius, a proprietor in most of them, being shut against him.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>The AUTHOR of LOVE in the SUDS to the PRINTER of the MORNING CHRONICLE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>In reprehending the faults of other men you should ever be cau∣tious of falling into the error you condemn. In yesterday's paper you indirectly charge me, among others, with having "urged a detesta∣ble charge with as much folly as wickedness against a certain great actor."—What other people have done I know not, nor does it con∣cern me; but I may safely defy all the Lawyers in Westminster-Hall fairly to deduce such a charge as you hint at from the eclogue in question. In this respect it is certainly as innocent as the great actor's Jubilee Ode! But granting it otherwise with any one else, how can you take upon you to say that such a charge is urged <HI>foolishly and wickedly?</HI> Can <HI>you</HI> know it to be false or groundless? And if not, on what grounds do you charge the accusers with <HI>folly</HI> and <HI>wickedness?</HI> Why does not the CANDOUR of the great actor, reply to the Queries put to him in your paper of Saturday last? But no; unable to justify himself at the bar of the publick, he flies for refuge to the quirks and quibbles of Westminster-Hall; and even this at the latter end of a term, in order to deceive the town into a notion that the court will countenance his prosecution. Why was not his motion made sooner, that cause might have been shewn in time, and the futility of it made immediately evident? Believe me, Sir, before an end is put to this business, the publick will be better enabled to judge on which side the <HI>folly and wickedness</HI> lies, than you appear to do at present.</P>

<L>SINCE, <HI>Beatrice,</HI> you've undertaken</L>
<L>To save a sland'rous culprit's bacon,</L>
<L>(A culprit of guilt's blackest roll, and</L>
<L>Unprincipled as <HI>Jemmy Bolland.</HI>)</L>
<L>By telling us <HI>how, where,</HI> and <HI>when</HI></L>
<L>Dan GARRICK has ill-treated KEN;</L>
<L>Give me, good dame, I humbly crave you,</L>
<L>A hearing for my fav'rite <HI>Davy;</HI></L>

<L>Some years ago an honest fellow,</L>
<L>As ever with sheer sack was mellow,</L>
<L>Who long has plac'd his hopes, his all, in</L>
<L>The gains of <HI>histrionic</HI> calling,</L>
<L>Who now is <HI>journeyman,</HI> now <HI>master,</HI></L>
<L>(Oh may he never meet disaster!</L>
<L>Was offer'd, for the truth ask KEN of it—</L>
<L>Jack Falstaff's Wedding for his benefit.</L>
<L><PB N="36" REF="30"/>LOVE, who at genius is no scoffer,</L>
<L>Makes KEN a bow, accepts his offer.</L>
<L>The piece was play'd—<HI>the audience claw'd it?</HI></L>
<L>Not they; nor did they much applaud it.</L>
<L>But as it 'scap'd the <HI>trial ordeal,</HI></L>
<L>To K—k's spirits 'twas a cordial.</L>
<L>He bounc'd, look'd big, and swell'd: his vanity</L>
<L>Was not to be restrain'd by any tie:</L>
<L>He swore his comedy might claim a</L>
<L>Precedence in the <HI>British</HI> drama:</L>
<L>Its flights so high, its wit so <HI>attic,</HI></L>
<L>'Twou'd crown him <HI>king</HI> of bards dramatic.</L>
<L>Happy for KEN had <HI>Drury</HI>'s sultan</L>
<L>Esteem'd his <HI>bantling</HI> an <HI>adult</HI> one!</L>
<L>But—fatal to the sale of tickets!</L>
<L>He said the <HI>child</HI> had got the <HI>rickets;</HI></L>
<L>Tho' some <HI>few features</HI> in't were sprightly,</L>
<L>Yet altogether 'twas <HI>unsightly.</HI></L>
<L>Howe'er to soften KEN's displeasure,</L>
<L>For disappointed <HI>same</HI> and <HI>treasure,</HI></L>
<L>He <HI>charitably</HI> stood his patron,</L>
<L>And brought him out the <HI>Widow'd</HI> Matron,</L>
<L>Than Falstaff's Wedding <HI>heavier</HI> bruited,</L>
<L>Yet to the <HI>reigning</HI> taste more suited.</L>
<L>Some years elaps'd, the doughty KEN</L>
<L>Applies to <HI>Drury</HI>'s Chief again:</L>
<L>He shook his head, and screw'd his phyz hard,</L>
<L>(The <HI>Widow'd Wife</HI> stuck in his gizzard)</L>
<L>"Must I, (cries he) place in my list</L>
<L>"A waspish <HI>Epigrammatist?</HI></L>
<L>"Accept his <HI>trash,</HI> and be the cully</L>
<L>"Of such a snarling, scribbling bully?</L>
<L><PB N="37" REF="31"/>"I've had <HI>enough</HI> of this same squire;</L>

<L>KEN vow'd revenge, made <HI>same</HI> his Pandar;</L>

<L>Thus, Beatrice, have I unfolded</L>
<L>(And <HI>fairly</HI> too, I will uphold it)</L>
<L>The cause of quarrel literary,</L>
<L>'Twixt <HI>Kenrick</HI> and renowned <HI>Garry.</HI></L>

<L>In the next term, at least in Hilary,</L>

<HEAD>To Dr. <HI>K</HI>—.</HEAD>
<L>DOCTOR, I have been out of town, or</L>
<L>This packet would have reach'd you sooner.</L>
<L>Prithee pull off your mask; for no man</L>
<L>Should injure that dear creature, <HI>woman.</HI></L>
<L>In Beatrice you give a handle</L>
<L>To fix on the dear sex a scandal.</L>
<L>What lady would take up goose quill in</L>
<L>Defence of such a slanderous villain?</L>
<L>At the word Fame you closely nibble,</L>
<L>And strive, by <HI>jesuitic</HI> quibble,</L>

<L>You tax as <HI>false</HI> what I relate</L>

<L>Blast my report, and falsehood fix it?</L>

<L>The Comedy (howe'er you laud it)</L>
<L>I told you <HI>was not much applauded.</HI></L>
