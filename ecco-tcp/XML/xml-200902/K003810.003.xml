<P>UNgrateful Emma! perverse and insensate child! You merit nei∣ther the pangs you cost me, nor the tenderness you receive from me. I gave you a reason cogent enough to have weaned a <HI>worthy</HI> girl from a thousand Hammonds. To that I might have added the sudden depar∣ture of a generous friend, who I <HI>now</HI>

This, indeed, you must have seen, since nothing but the most ex∣treme stupidity could remain igno∣rant of those attentions which, for many weeks past, have been lavished upon you by Sir Robert Raymond, a man, oh inconsiderate! who saved thy aged father in the very crisis of his misfortunes, and too delicate to de∣mand as a debt the tender returns of love, which he would have sued for as a favour, is gone, almost broken-hearted, away. I had promised to <HI>conceal</HI> his confidence, but you extort it from me: nay, you continue still to doat upon the wretch who is fighting against all the best and dearest con∣nexions

of your family. I will not endure it. You assume the language of decision, and call it the sentiment of reason. You set yourself up as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> judge, and lift your woman's voice against the sacred principles of patriot and parent. It is not to be borne. Let me hear no more on the subject. Cease your threats about daggers, darts, and death. I look DOWN upon such romance. Forbear to urge me. You are not to learn the touches of my temper. <HI>My principles</HI> are not less sacred than <HI>your passion. Your</HI> principles! What are they? Airy no∣things. <HI>Mine</HI> are the solemn af∣fections of a lover of his country, and a detester of its oppressors, a <HI>de∣tester of Henry Hammond!</HI> Why will

Your affection is that of a girl whimpering after a boy. Is this an affection to be brought in competition with that glorious fire which the love of liberty, and an ab∣horrence (as settled as it is sublime) of rights usurped and saith broken?

<HEAD>TO SIR ROBERT RAYMOND.</HEAD>
<P>O RAYMOND, Raymond! my oldest friend, my truest com∣panion, pity, ah pity the anguish of a father—pity a parent whose persecu∣tions have driven away his child! Emma hath eloped. Heaven knows where she has wandered. Under pretence of visiting a friend near town, she went in one of the public stages, with intent, as she said, to re∣turn in the evening. The friend whom she <HI>pretended</HI> to visit was Mrs. Arnold of Richmond, on whom she had often called in a neigh∣bourly way. I remained therefore perfectly unalarmed till twilight. A
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>
tempest of thunder and lightening happening about nine o'clock, I sent over a servant to Mrs. Arnold's, ima∣gining she might be afraid to come through it alone. The servant re∣turned from Mrs. Arnold with news that Emma called there for a few mi∣nutes by way of morning ride, but went away in a great hurry. It was near midnight before I received these horrid tidings, and then I ordered my horses to be harnessed, and went at full speed to every house where the stages set up. The people were all in bed, and I obtained answers to my questions with difficulty. None were satisfactory. I traversed the streets in a distracted manner, for oh, you know how I doat upon Emma! I
<PB N="15" REF="13"/>
could not give the coachman any di∣rection, and he continued dragging me about, but I bid him go any where rather than to my own house. No trace—no clue—no glimmering of hope! Hard-hearted girl! What though I urged her to forget the un∣generous Henry, am not I her father? But I will be calm, I will cut her from my affections for ever. I am just got home. It is day-break. The servants are all dispersed to hunt after a runaway girl. What a dreadful morning! The hemisphere is in a blaze!—The wind blows hard!—The firmament opens its flaming breast!—I see into its bowels. I am sitting all alone. Oh my heart, what a thunder∣clap was there!—It is now rolling
<PB N="16" REF="14"/>
along the sphere. Oh Emma, Emma, my daughter—my child—my darling—where, where art thou? Another! WONDER-WORKING GOD! behold a contrite parent upon his knees, lame and decrepid as he is, to supplicate a covering for the beloved fugitive. Perhaps, Raymond, our poor discon∣solate—the mutual joy of our hearts—perhaps some sudden stroke of—I dare not turn imagination that hor∣rible way. No, no: Emma is at last disobedient, she is base, she has abu∣sed her father, she—</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I CLAIM the assistance of a man whom I know to be generous, who honours me with his esteem, and whom I venerate for the anci∣ent friendship that has long uni∣ted our families. By the powerful force of <HI>all</HI> these feelings I conjure you, on the receipt of this letter, to visit my father. Assure him that his dear, dear image lives unimpaired in my heart. Tell him that my absent∣ing myself in this manner is not the truant trick of a girl who triumphs in the vexation of a parent, but proceeds
<PB N="21" REF="19"/>
from a motive most virtuous, most irresistable, most conscientious—from a duty that appeals to my heart, my senses, and my soul. O let him not think that I <HI>glory</HI> in the necessity which takes me one moment from <HI>him.</HI> I lament, I weep, I mourn over it. I could wish that each duty went hand in hand, and that some of their objects did not lie so wide apart from others. Superior to every deceit, I would have consul∣ted my father even on the present measure, but he will recollect the terror into which his late conversations threw me, and will then be convinced how impossible it was to risque such an ecclaircissment. Yet even now I will forbear to justify my departure,
<PB N="22" REF="20"/>
because I would suffer some reproach myself, rather than try to establish an irregular example. But the power who is giving me strength to sustain the great business I am about to un∣dertake, has placed in my bosom something which reconciles me to the enterprize. Oh Sir Robert, there is a duty which <HI>must</HI> be performed—at least attempted. Nature, reason, ho∣nour, and faith the most hallowed, all stir within me; nay, God himself, at the marking of whose awful name, I bow, seems looking down from his heaven of heavens with approba∣tion. I may seem to be romantic, when I mean only to shew myself sincere. All sort of research will be vain. I would not have yielded to
<PB N="23" REF="21"/>
the least semblance of a scheme, which is most terrible to my nature, could it by any means have been avoided. My father will call to mind certain sentiments, and do me justice in his own dear bosom on this occasion.</P>
<P>Sir Robert Raymond, I ever desired to be uniform, and to reconcile the distinct parts of my conduct with the whole. Yet I will bear up against the charge of impropriety in this one instance for the sake of —but further explanation is unneces∣sary. Go then, oh amiable medi∣ator betwixt parent and child—go, and plead my cause in all the elo∣quence of friendship. Obtain for me
<PB N="24" REF="22"/>
the paternal pardon—sustain his heart, and do not leave him a prey to sorrow.</P>
<P>Excuse my forbearing to give you my address. Pity the concealments which are thus imposed. Be it suffi∣cient that I will continue to send you accounts of myself at every oppor∣tunity.</P>

<HEAD>TO SIR ROBERT RAYMOND.</HEAD>
<P>YOUR letter, Sir Robert, with its dear and dreadful inclosure came to hand. It is now before my eyes, which are streaming in penitence for the phrenzy which has banished my daughter. I now behold the whole matter too plain. Oh, my friend, I treated the most dutiful of children with unwonted harshness, and in the patriot I extinguished the parent. I expected that a soul like Emma's should circumscribe itself within the pale of politics. Curse on the rage of party! Execrated be the tyranies of war! Ah what are causes, countries,
<PB N="26" REF="24"/>
worlds, to the loss of one dear child adorned with the virtues of Emma Corbett! Blind, doating zeal! what hast thou to do with an old man's heart? What, with the sacred season of the silver hair? Is mine an age to engage in these tumultuous subjects? No. I should have taken my darling daughter to my bosom, and with an enlarged benevolence prayed fer∣vently for the returning embrace of a divided people. <HI>That</HI> would have been true patriotism and true philan∣thropy. Instead of which, dolt and dotard as I was, I mixed with hot-headed giddiness in the affray. I in∣terested myself in every fugitive breath of vague intelligence; and, while I
<PB N="27" REF="25"/>
talked of justice, I was encouraging slaughter; wholly forgetting, or too blood-thirsty to remember, that either army is composed of kindred and of countrymen. Behold Raymond, how I am punished! But where, where all this time is Emma? No date! No address! A young creature un∣friended, alone, of a delicate frame, and harrassed by fatigue! <HI>Sick</HI> also! Never used to travel unattended—Oh heaven! But she will return. The thought makes me easier. Let me indulge it. How tender will I be to her—with what fondness will I hang upon her neck, and hide her blushes in my bosom—how will I talk—how soothe—how console her—oh I will
<PB N="28" REF="26"/>
kiss her into confidence and compo∣sure. I will even converse—(pardon me Sir Robert, pardon the effusions of a repenting heart)—I will even converse upon her darling theme.—The name of Henry shall be men∣tioned, and, if it does her good, not without tenderness. Alas! what has the youth done, but—Yes, yes, Emma will return. She must. She shall. The slender and trembling thread of my being is sustained by no other hope.</P>
<P>I have sent advertisements to the papers, inviting her home, describing person, circumstances, and situations, but concealing names. I have dis∣patched
<PB N="29" REF="27"/>
various messengers to all the ports to have her tenderly intreated, almost cordially <HI>controuled,</HI> should her romantic nature—for oh I sus∣pect she meditates—Was there ever any thing so wild—But she will never be able to carry it into execution, and I will not even suppose it practicable. She will return. I shall recover the treasure of my age. But the interim is anguish—oh, hasten my friend to soften it. I am sick, and Emma is not at my side. I see her not at the harpsichord—I hear not her enchant∣ing voice—I contemplate not her lovely features—all, all the exact images of her dear mother—her mo∣ther! who would shudder in her grave were she—</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="28"/>A servant enters to tell me there is nothing but her own little money-box missing. Her cloaths are all above stairs. I dare not go to look at them. I dare not open the door of her chamber. It would certainly be my death.</P>

<P>I AM not sorry you found it incon∣venient to meet me. Objects of gloom, I know, are intolerable to you. Castleberry at present affords little else. I used, my friend, to fly from these as assiduously as yourself. Yet now they are become very dear. I love the solitude which this scene af∣fords me. It was lately adorned by the society of Emma. Ah elegant and hapless girl! She has not only eloped, but engaged me to justify the step she has taken to her father. Oh Frederick, her language is so sweet, her power over me so resistless, and her firm affection for this happy Ham∣mond,
<PB N="32" REF="30"/>
this heroic rival, so respect∣able, that my whole soul yields im∣plicit obedience to the very de∣sires which involve me in despair! What, of things possible, would I not do to secure to her but one moment's happiness? Alas! my friend, sin∣cerely as I know you love me, I dare not tell you all that I intend to do. Yet consider a young creature about to venture on the wild and uncertain ocean, moved by a sacred impulse in favour of a worthy lover, who has himself left a blooming mistress, whose society he consents to sacrifice, to his country. Consider also this lover, as one who is the choice of Emma, and is every way suitable to her in person as in age.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="31"/>
When you have maturely weighed these circumstances, then tell me what at <HI>my</HI> age and under <HI>my</HI> circum∣stances I ought to do. My friend, no man knows what virtue or what energy there is in him till after the hour of serious exertion.</P>
<P>There is a project, Berkley, rolling in my mind, and if on a little more reflection I can reconcile it wholly to the dictate that uniformly sways me, I shall undertake something that will excite your <HI>ridicule.</HI> But for any thing of that kind I shall be prepared. I have only two great powers to con∣sult, my reason and my conscience. What they inspire can never be

<P>I AM writing in a common public-house at this town, from whence in about half an hour I shall set off for America. I am resolved to perform this voyage at all hazards. Do not, dear Louisa, accuse me of wanting confidence because I did not acquaint you with my design. I could never support the idea of involving a friend in the perils of a trust, which may pro∣duce altercation in the issue. When the soul is settled in its plan, it is use∣less to ask advice; and to enjoin se∣crecy in any family matter, is gene∣rally

to embroil the person entrusted with some part of it or another.</P>
<P>The haste and agitation in which I write is not to be expressed. The house is crouded with sailors and their parting friends. I am equipped with a proper disguise. No matter what embarrassments I have had to procure or to put it on. The wind does not allow me leisure for descriptions. I am going as a cabbin passenger in a vessel called the <HI>Henry.</HI> The very sound of the name affects me with a sweet superstition.

thus with circumstances to take all our grief away upon my account, O my beloved sister; for you see I am equal to the task. The boatmen ap∣pear. They tell me the gales are fa∣vourable. The first view of the ocean is awful. But it leads to Henry.</P>
<P>Adieu. The mariners are impati∣ent. They call me <HI>fair-weather</HI> sailor; which is a joke levelled purely at my complexion; but they have no suspi∣cion of Emma. Oh, farewell! They hurry me. I must fold up the letter —I must bid you <HI>indeed</HI> adieu.</P>

<HEAD>EDWARD CORBETT TO HIS FATHER.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER having been thirteen months agonized amongst the wounded, and more than once consi∣dered as the prize of death, I am at length able to write a few lines to ac∣quaint you that I exist; by which in∣formation, I flatter myself I shall make a father, a sister, and a friend, most happy. The arm and shoulder, which were wounded, are at length cured without amputation, but the half of the left cheek is gone. These tidings I had caused to be conveyed to England long since, by letters sent at different opportunities, by various means of conveyance; but as I have
<PB N="44" REF="42"/>
not received your replies, I fear either those miscarried, or mine have never reached you. Indeed, war puts a dreadful stop to this branch of com∣munication, although the only one which can relieve the pains of so p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣rilous an absence.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON offers me the mean of future retreat and inactivity, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> consideration, I suppose, of my fears. But I am now too far engaged to ac∣cept this with any honour. I wish it may be no more necessary to fire; and they <HI>talk</HI> indeed of peace, but there is no real prospect of such a blessing being at hand. I fought, at first, in my own defence, and must, I fear, con∣tinue to do so still. The English per∣sist

<P>Wherefore does my old friend Henry stay idling at home

Why does he not take one side or the other as principle directs? He was wont to maintain with me warm dis∣putes in favour of Great-Britain, but by this time his opinion must be changed, and the cause of America must be dear to him, were it only in

respect of her youth, her bravery, and her misfortunes. Tell him I should be glad to receive him here—to re∣ceive him, in that case, as a brother; and on those conditions, too, we will both return one day or another, and enjoy the fruits of a double marriage; for notwithstanding your resistance, my father, I must still remind you that I have a heart only for Louisa.

I now fondly approximate every person who has been dear to any part of my family, and who hath had more claim to our tenderness than the sister of Henry? Yet let me not forget in my sorrow to tell you of one joy that sparkles in the cup of bitterness which is allotted me to drink. My son Edward lives, and he mentions Louisa Hammond not coldly! Come and let us talk of

<HEAD>SECOND INCLOSURE FROM SIR ROBERT RAYMOND.</HEAD>
<P>CORBETT, the seal of Providence is surely upon my enterprize! Oh happy chance! I have at once saved and rescued your daughter. It pleased God to carry me into the same place of confinement, where I found her mingled with the multitude of our unhappy countrymen. A violent shriek upon my entrance betrayed her to me. Her man's apparel became no longer a veil to hide her from eyes so familiar with her voice and her features. She fainted in my arms.</P>
<P>The prisoners were too much in∣volved in the sullen gloom of their
<PB N="67" REF="65"/>
own melancholy to regard the distress of another. The paper which I in∣close, spotted, as you see, with drops of blood from her own lovely arm, fell from her bosom. By the time she recovered, one of the officers who had guarded us approached.—She looked at him a moment (it being the first time she had seen him since he came in) and then sunk without any appearance of life upon the floor. She lay as a corpse.</P>
<P>Oh merciful Heaven!—Oh God, great and gracious God! cried the officer, it is—it is—it must be Emma—it must be my SISTER!</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="66"/>Presently, Emma and Edward Cor∣bett (for it was your son my friend) were both embracing upon their knees.</P>
<P>It was no time to explain. She was moved out of the prison. I was permitted to attend. Edward Cor∣bett in his own arms conveyed her to an apartment. He obtained leave of absence from the farther duties of the day. He was the nurse of your poor Emma. Oh, Mr. Corbett, <HI>I</HI> was not idle.</P>
<P>Washington happened to be quar∣tered at the same town, preparing the manoeuvres of a new attack. He is easy of access; and being at liberty on
<PB N="69" REF="67"/>
a parole of honour I gained an inter∣view.</P>
<P>Ah, can you not guess its motive? what <HI>could</HI> it be but the <HI>freedom</HI> of the captive Emma? The General heard the story of her love as I related it. I concealed no part from him but that which had reference to my own for∣mer folly. I brought the narrative down to the moment of reciting it. The soldier's cheek was not without the graceful dignity of a tear. He wept.</P>
<P>Sacred, said he, be the rights of hospitality: I am not at war with the <HI>affections.</HI> Ever priviledged be <HI>their</HI> emotions. I feel them all. The
<PB N="70" REF="68"/>
beauteous prisoner is at liberty, Sir Robert, to go where she pleases. I shall appoint persons to attend her, who may prevent all interruption and insult; but <HI>you</HI> methinks Sir Robert, should continue to follow her for∣tunes as a <HI>friend,</HI> you are <HI>both</HI> free.</P>
<P>I flew to Edward Corbett with the tidings. Emma had by this time ac∣quainted him with her situation.</P>
<P>At what a moment did I enter the room! Your son was pronuncing or rather <HI>attempting</HI> to pronounce, the names of wife and parent, of Louisa and his little Edward. And have I then these blessings, (cried he) and is
<PB N="71" REF="69"/>
my father <HI>yet</HI> in ignorance what claims, what doubly-tender claims, Louisa Corbett hath upon him? He then pressed his sister in his arms, and they wept together.</P>
<P>Surprizes came too fast upon the hapless youth. He knew not that Henry was under arms. He did not know that he was an enemy. Yet he dropped for awhile the fierceness of the soldier, and acted as a man—as the child of nature—as the husband of Louisa, and the brother of Emma. Then go, my sister, said he, your ca∣reer is too glorious to be checked. In contemplating your conduct, I rise above all the prejudices of party. Alas, my sister, I know too well the
<PB N="72" REF="70"/>
sorrows of love and separation not to respect them. You find me here the foe of Henry, but it is not now the day of battle, and were he at this mo∣ment here, should I not expand these arms to receive the lover of Emma? Go then. But we are on the eve of a desperate undertaking.—Our army moves to-morrow. I tremble for thee! Perhaps we may never meet more—perhaps—ah retire, retire my best loved sister, ere the idea of lo∣sing you for ever should tempt me to break my promise, and—</P>
<P>—This fraternal kiss, this affec∣tionate embrace, and farewell. Give me not leisure to reflect, let me not have opportunity to consider the con∣sequences
<PB N="73" REF="71"/>
of thus—Ah take her from me, Sir Robert, she is gaining on my affections, and I shall not be able—</P>
<P>Here he stopped Mr. Corbett; Emma beheld the gathering storm of tenderness coming on, and exerting a resolution more than human, as fear∣ing she should be prevented from purs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing the great object of her ad∣venture, which was even dearer than a brother, she caught me by the arm and shortened a scene too poignant to be continued.</P>
<P>No sooner were we alone—I am interrupted. Farewell.</P>

<HEAD>IN CONTINUATION.</HEAD>
<P>No sooner had we got beyond the reach of those sighs which were break∣ing from the heart of Edward, than his lovely sister fell upon her knees, pressed my hand to her bosom, and spake thus.—Oh generous delive∣rer, I devote to thee the first moment that the confusions of crouding inci∣dents allow, to pour sorth the tribute of my gratitude. I ask not the means by which heaven directed you to me, but I feel the motive of your voyage so pathetically, so perfectly, so—ah Sir Robert, wherefore do you heap on me this agonizing goodness? Where∣fore did you pursue the footsteps of one whose pre-occupied heart and
<PB N="75" REF="73"/>
plighted hand make it impossible to reward your kindness or your gene∣rosity? Not even a beloved brother, whom I thought breathed no more, not even Edward, long-lost and newly found, could prevail with me to forego the purpose of my pilgrimage. No, by this affecting effusion of tears which are now bathing your hand, I swear—but it is unnecessary. Behold a woman firmly resolved, Sir Robert, oh why are you then—indeed it is vain, <HI>indeed</HI> it is. Go then I conjure you, return to my dear, my drooping father—assure him that his Emma is in no danger—tell him that his darling son is found; alas! how I forget myself, of this you say he is already informed, but at all
<PB N="76" REF="74"/>
events return; it is to no end that you follow me: how can you expect—</P>
<P>I expect it <HI>not</HI> Miss Corbett, said I, attempting to raise her up.</P>
<P>Here will I remain, cried she, till you pledge to me your honour that you will here close the debts which it will never be in my power to discharge. It is no place or time for argument, Sir Robert. You are even now pre∣venting me from the great business of my life. I beseech you to leave me. I am not ignorant of your passion, but I thought your prudence in never re∣vealing it to me by your own mouth—in short sir, I must insist on—</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="75"/>I saw her mistake, my dear Corbett, and briefly explained it. How shall I describe to you the emanation, the burst of tender gratitude, when she found—but indeed I do not deserve half she said, or half she thought.</P>
<P>Alas! it is passion still that drives meon—not, indeed, the passion which partakes of one gross image, or of one vehement appetite. Pitied be the wretch who persecutes an engaged heart. Yet I love to see, to serve, to oblige her—I love to—</P>
<P>Again interrupted! No wonder. I am writing amidst scenes of con∣stant disturbance. The seats and the∣atres of war are before me. The
<PB N="78" REF="76"/>
guards of a generous enemy, in com∣passion to private woe, are in front and in rear. It is all deathful prepa∣ration. There is no prospect of peace. On every brow is defiance. In every eye flashes the bloody determination. We hear the shrieks of widows and daughters and fatherless children, as we move forward. Families are bu∣sied in burying their dead, rescued from the corruption of promiscuous carnage. Hearses and funerals pass thick along. The bell of death tolls out in every street; but Emma is still fixed in her design. Her eyes melt, her countenance is pale, but her heart pants with love, and her soul is un∣daunted. Adieu.</P>

<P>Oh sacred force of sovereign ten∣derness! Emma has tidings of her Henry. Our enquiries have at length terminated in success. He is now with his regiment off John's-Town. Thither we are bending our course with the utmost expedition. I send you not the minutiae of intervening adventures. They yield to enterprizes of greater moment. We are within one days journey of the place.</P>
<P>By heavens Corbett, the roses are suddenly thrown over the cheek of your child, and the pale of fatigue and sickess and loss of blood, (which has not been inconsiderable) all give way
<PB N="80" REF="78"/>
to the joyful expectation of seeing her Henry.</P>
<P>Surely it requires only a generous effort to turn our disappointments to amiable account. To conquer affec∣tion is not, I feel, always possible; but to direct it from one worthy path into another, when the former is unfit or unjust, is assuredly in our power. Henry himself cannot adore Emma more sincerely than myself. My whole heart is hers; oft it trembles, oft it bleeds, but the choice either to be the object of esteem or the object of aversion is before me. Oh I would not forfeit the partial sentiment which my conduct has lodged in the breast of Emma, for any other earthly enjoy∣ment.
<PB N="81" REF="79"/>
She owns me for her friend, her <HI>first</HI> of friends. She talks to me without reserve.—She looks at me sometimes till the heart's soft tear is in her eye. Ah, that tear! it is more worth than the possession of all the reluctant beauty that ever gold, gran∣deur, or importunity, extorted into their arms. I feel it stream over my senses. Blessed sympathy! Pure ef∣fusion! Generous, glorious Emma!</P>
<P>I am penciling these informations of our route, sometimes in the vehicle and sometimes in a room.</P>
<P>Emma has this moment desired the driver to stop. The door of the chaise is open; she jumps out, say∣ing
<PB N="82" REF="80"/>
to me in a whisper, that a lucky thought strikes her.</P>
<P>I will follow her.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>IN CONTINUATION.</HEAD>
<P>God of all goodness! didst thou ever create another Emma?</P>
<P>In passing along, she took note of some bushes which were covered thickly with a dun-coloured berry that clustered in the hedge-rows. I assisted her in gathering these without daring to ask for information as to causes. She hath an air of intreaty which cuts short all curiosity about motive, and leaves us no other soli∣citude
<PB N="83" REF="81"/>
than that of gratifying her by implicit obedience.</P>
<P>I knew not the design of Emma in picking the berries till the evening, and <HI>then</HI> she explained to me their use.</P>
<P>Now for an <HI>experiment,</HI> dear Sir Robert, said she, taking up the bun∣dle, and going into her chamber at a publick-house where we baited at twilight.</P>
<P>In about an hour she re-entered—she <HI>re-entered,</HI> Corbett; but oh how different from that Emma who had so recently retired! You know the clear and lucid white that mixes with the
<PB N="84" REF="82"/>
eloquent bloom in her countenance—you know that rich tint of tenderness and ardour, of pathetic softness and graceful passion, which forms her com∣plexion. Imagine my astonishment at beholding these discoloured in the darkest shade of that peculiar disguise which the juice of the berries we had collected cast over the skin. The stain was deep, strong, and apparently fixed. It resembled almost exactly the hue of some of the savages whom we had observed to be wounded in a town through which we passed.</P>
<P>It was certainly <HI>inspiration,</HI> (said Emma, rejoicing at the alteration as she surveyed it in the glass.) Ah how preferable this precious dye, conti∣nued
<PB N="85" REF="83"/>
she, to the fairest complexion in the world. I shall assist Henry, I shall touch his dear hand, and attend him in every danger, without distressing him by surprize, or disarming him by softness. Oh, my good Sir Robert, romantic as may seem the steps I have taken, be assured that I proceed with the utmost caution. I do not even <HI>now</HI> design to interfere with the hor∣rid virtues of Henry's profession. I will not dare to place myself betwixt him and his duty. I will share his dangers, but cannot consent any lon∣ger to bear about a wretched being without at least attempting to render it serviceable to my friend. Your ge∣nerosity well fits you to receive these apologies, if indeed any apologies
<PB N="86" REF="84"/>
should be necessary for the conduct of Emma on this trying occasion.</P>
<P>I could not reply, Mr. Corbett. Even her avowals of the affection that she bears to Henry become new sour∣ces of my tenderness and admiration. But we are setting off again.</P>

your dear, your darling Edward is now <HI>indeed</HI> —</P>
<P>Bear up, my hapless friend, against the storm. To learn to suffer is the science of humanity. Each has his throes of heart. War, which level millions with the dust, has at length—</P>

The human general permitted him to seek his sister, and either guide her to the arm of Henry, or persuade her to return He promised to return in three days. Alas! he will return no more. A party of the English were burning
<PB N="88" REF="86"/>
a village after a sudden attack. Ed∣ward drew his unavailing sword to defend himself and the inhabitants, who were flying different ways in ter∣ror and despair.—And there my friend it was your son received his wound—his wound of death.</P>
<P>The conquerors drove off the cat∣tle, loaded themselves with the spoils of conquest, then suffered the pea∣sants to escape, and returned to the troops from whence they had been detached.</P>
<P>Edward bled fast; but having tra∣ced our route, he gave directions to the two soldiers who accompanied him and pressed onward. He was resolved
<PB N="89" REF="87"/>
once more, he said, to behold his sis∣ter. The men, who were indeed of those under his command, obeyed his orders; supported him on each side as he sat in the chaise, till, poor young man!—</P>
<P>—You know the rest. He sunk upon one of their shoulders, and with his dying breath insisted on their taking his corpse to Emma, of whom he had received tydings by the guide who had last left us, and whom he met on his return.</P>
<P>The poor fellows came on discon∣solate with their dead master. They reached the town where we stopped, and were passing the window of our
<PB N="90" REF="88"/>
inn, when we heard a cry of "the armies are engaged, the armies are engaged!"</P>
<P>The postilion got from his horse; the two soldiers (who had taken the precaution to alter their dress as Ame∣ricans) leaped from the carriage, and joined the multitude that thronged the streets.</P>
<P>The body of Edward was deferred. Emma, (who had then just finished her remarks on her disguise) seeing a man lie motionless, approached the chaise door, and there she beheld—</P>
<P>Oh Mr. Corbett, what accumula∣ted miseries is it fated for this virtu∣ous woman to undergo!</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="89"/>'Tis <HI>I</HI> then that have <HI>caused</HI> thy death, thou beloved youth, said she! No language can describe her agonies, but they were attended to by none but myself: for the whole town was in consternation at the news of the engagement. Every house was emp∣tied. The two armies had marched all night, and distributed their forces. We heard of the largest parties being engaged off John's-Town, and in that place was quartered the regiment of Henry. What was to be done? Ed∣ward lay dead before us. Emma was folding his clay-cold body in her arms. She seemed to be lost in a stupor of irremediable grief. She forgot for awhile her Henry. The alarm spread every moment more wide—horror
<PB N="92" REF="90"/>
exhibited itself in every possible form. To continue in such a situation was madness: to leave the breathless re∣mains of Edward—oh shocking thought!—Oh Mr. Corbett, the exi∣gencies of war, and the terrors of a town under such a panic, are not to be described. Old men were moving their decrepid limbs from door to door in despair of escape, and mothers with their children went wailing by us.</P>
<P>With pious haste, these hands, as∣sisted by my heart, (which is devoted to every connexion of Emma) prepa∣red an hasty grave for the reliques of your son.—Emma touched at the ce∣remony burst into a flood of tears, and exerting herself beyond what is re∣ported
<PB N="93" REF="91"/>
of her sex, joined in the last sad offices of love.</P>
<P>We are just come from the sacred spot where Edward is deposited!—Emma recovers—she has been several times upon her knees during my marking these circumstances of our distress. Let us go on, Sir Robert, she says, or rather, oh generous man, remain you here, and let me proceed; my duty to Henry yet remains.—</P>
<P>It was in vain to expostulate. She saw the danger, but felt no emotions of dismay. All feminine and gentle as she is, she rose above the spirit of humanity.</P>

<P>It was altogether an impulse of most solemn enthusiasm. Emma was resolved, and I am the friend of Emma.</P>
<P>Yet the tearful looks which she cast towards Edward's grave pierced me to the heart. One hallowed kiss more imprinted upon that earth, Sir Robert, and I will delay no longer. Pity a sister!</P>
<P>I stood at some distance and saw the lovely one depart. O what mi∣nutes

<P>N. B. I have ventured to whisper it very softly to Emma, that I am about to <HI>seal</HI> the pacquet which my trem∣bling hand has written as it could snatch the flying minute.—<HI>"To my</HI>
<PB N="102" REF="100"/>
<HI>father!</HI> said she. Oh God, Oh God! Tell—tell him—</P>
<P>Here she folded her arms, looked up to heaven, tried to articulate more, and sunk upon the bed.</P>
<P>Unfortunate Corbett! This fatal war has reduced all the honours and blessings of your house to the dust! Alas! how many thousand fathers <HI>be∣side</HI> has it not wounded beyond the reach of this world's remedies?</P>
<P>I have stolen from the chamber of Emma to scribble the <HI>inclosure</HI> in the presence of proper witnesses, by whom it is attested. As we are dying in virtue, do <HI>thou,</HI> oh venerable man,
<PB N="103" REF="101"/>
still try to live in peace, and await the stroke which shall be commissioned from above, in God's good time, to summon you to us.</P>
<P>One more look at Emma, that I may send you the latet intelligence.</P>
<P>She breathes.</P>
<P>The silver chord is not quite bro∣ken: yet the cold, <HI>cold</HI> dews descend so fast—</P>

<P>A third time I have looked in upon her. The officer who is going to the head quarters with the news of the va∣rious fortunes that have attended the detached parties in this part of the country, has, in great humanity, waited. I told him, that a father's happiness or despair was concerned in his obliging me. His last minute is come.

<HEAD>LETTER CXXVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD>TO C. CORBETT, ESQ.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From Henry Hammond.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>THAT paragon of her sex, your daughter! That man too, soar∣ing above the flight of humanity, who attended her as the companion of all her perils, all her pangs! The writer of this letter (or more properly speak∣ing, the person by whom this letter is dictated) is at a loss by what means, or in what language, to convey to you the wonders which yet he is most anxious to impart.</P>
<P>By gentle degrees—oh, Mr. Cor∣bett, let me open upon you the bles∣sings which, by the contrivance of
<PB N="107" REF="105"/>
Providence, have been brought about. Summon your heart to bear the best, the dearest news which it is in the nature of human things for you to hear. O let the agony of <HI>that</HI> in∣formation, which Sir Robert Ray∣mond's letter has, doubtless, produ∣ced, be, in great measure, done away by the happier tydings that will sa∣lute you in this.</P>
<P>The <HI>hand-writing</HI> of the person now dictating, would too much discompose you. He makes use, therefore, of an amanuensis to prepare the way to cir¦cumstances of uncommon joy; and to give them to you in the security of more progressive explanation.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="106"/>The leading step to every other fe∣licity you must hear <HI>first.</HI> You, who have de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ply drank of the bitter cup, must now try to support, without in∣toxication, the taste of sweeter ingre∣dients.</P>
<P>From the point of death your Emma has recovered. The interpo∣sing hand of heaven was <HI>suddenly</HI> ex∣tended.</P>
<P>Ten days after the departure of Sir Robert's pacquet, she was in a situa∣tion to leave her bed. To what <HI>pur∣pose</HI> did she leave it? Resolution, oh how sacred is thy force when anima∣ted by the breath of love!</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="107"/>If Henry be dead, said she, it is still the duty of Emma to pay him the mournful offices which she has paid to Edward.</P>
<P>She insisted on searching for the corpse of the man who had caused all her misfortunes.</P>
<P>The generous Sir Robert Ray∣mond was at that time himself confi∣ned by sickness which threatened his life: when he was out of danger, Emma gave him in tenderest charge, and set out, alone, towards those woods where some late skirmishes had passed. On her way she had the precaution to use again those berries which tinge the skin: to these she
<PB N="110" REF="108"/>
added a certain bark that had been mentioned to her in the course of her various enquiries.</P>
<P>Behold, oh Mr. Corbett, behold the dear and delicate Emma, wandering, unprotected, in the woods of Ameri∣ca.—Behold her bearing over her tender shoulder the mere necessaries of decent covering.—Behold the most gentle, and most female form expo∣sed to all the dangers of a wild and unknown country—picking her food from the hedges—straying she knew not whither—in disguise—in disorder —in despair!</P>
<P>Incredible were the toils of her re∣search—incredible her fatigue. The
<PB N="111" REF="109"/>
forests are here, you know, of great extent: the wilds immesurable.</P>
<P>After several days travelling, du∣ring which time she had not encoun∣tered any passenger who could give her the least intelligence, she sat her∣self down as usual, about the noon, and wept over her misfortunes.</P>
<P>Scarce had she rested a moment, ere the clamour of human voices, shouting at a small distance, caught her attention. She pressed hastily forward through the foliage, and ob∣served, at a little aperture in the forest, a party of soldiers engaging with a tribe of Indians; but while she was eagerly examining the persons of the
<PB N="112" REF="110"/>
<HI>former,</HI> the <HI>latter</HI> were put to flight, and retreated with the utmost prerci∣pitation: the soldiers pursued, and both were out of sight ere Emma had time to approach nearer to them.</P>
<P>She saw enough, however, to con∣vince her that the regimentals were British, and the uniform of the off∣icers such as belonged to the regiment of Henry, you will guess her despair when she did not perceive Henry amongst them.</P>
<P>The bodies of several English sol∣diers were seen in different parts of the forest, but the corpse of Ham∣mond could, by no diligence, be found.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="111"/>Still indefatigable, she went on, though by this time reduced almost to the last exigencies of nature, and every thing subdued but tender reso∣lution, and the love which inspired it.</P>
<P>At length, Providence relented to her wishes, and directed her steps to a broad common path-way, across which was extended a human figure, lying as dead, with an arrow sticking in his bosom. You already perceive that it was no other than <HI>Henry him∣self.</HI> This, you <HI>may</HI> perceive, but no tongue can give you the faintest idea of that unparalleled heroism and fide∣lity, which now inspired the soul of Emma! She found the body yet warm, the pulse slowly moving, and
<PB N="114" REF="112"/>
the heart languidly beating with life. She extracted the arrow, and sucked the wound—she had heard of the In∣dians using shafts whose points were envenomed: and rightly concluding <HI>this</HI> to be one of them, applied to it her lovely lips without hesitation.—This addi∣tional danger, was an addi∣tional motive to the deed. Oh Mr. Corbett, whatan angel is Emma!</P>
<P>Signs of existence increased. With scarce a covering from the sky, the af∣fectionate Emma sheltered her unfor∣tunate charge for many days. Ere his senses returned, she thickened her disguise by all the arts in her power. Oh can any thing less eloquent than the great Author of Nature describe
<PB N="115" REF="113"/>
to you the transport of this wondrous creature when she first beheld the long-closed eye of Henry open on the light —and open on herself?</P>
<P>Think Mr. Corbett, how difficult <HI>concealment</HI> must have been at this extatic moment; then, consider what presence of mind was necessary, to repress the dear and dangerous effu∣sion. The silver tones of the softest voice in the world were so artfully changed, as to correspond with the rest of her appearance. She fed him with what the fortune of an hour's hunting amongst the fruits of the fo∣rest afforded. He could not move. No soldiers returned. Men drop in a skirmish, and are sought for no more.
<PB N="116" REF="114"/>
No house was near: no hut: and she dared not stray too far from the place where he lay, lest she should lose sight of the spot. But now Henry felt the puncture of a want which even Emma could not accommodate. Fruits and vegetables, collected by chance, as they grew obvious, and within the beat of Emma's journeyings, were too unsubstantial. It seemed as if famine would compleat what poison had be∣gun. For lack of proper nutriment after fatigues so imminent, he was re∣duced to an extreme of languor even worse than that of Emma; whom ten∣derness seemed to have rendered supe∣rior to every thing that could befall herself.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="115"/>In these moments it was that Henry yielded to despair—in these moments his heart melted with gratitude to his protector—</P>
<P>Oh generous unknown, (said he feebly) whosoever thou art, receive the dying acknowledgements of the man whom thou hast endeavoured to rescue from an untimely death. Had those kind endeavours succeeded, what thanks shouldest thou receive from one of the <HI>best</HI>—the <HI>dearest</HI>—but it may not be—I am nearly ex∣hausted—perhaps, ere yet another hour moves by—lest that <HI>should</HI> be the case, let me, oh let me, while yet I have the power to call down heaven's choicest blessings on that lovely
<PB N="118" REF="116"/>
mourner, whose tears are haply stream∣ing at this moment for the expiring Henry—Ah sir, ah worthy youth, couldst thou see her—couldst thou attest for me these dying sentiments—couldst thou assure her that with my latest breath—But that is impossi∣ble, she is a thousand leagues from these fatal shores. No matter. Oh hear me GOD ! do <HI>thou,</HI> this <HI>night,</HI> this <HI>instant,</HI> suggest to her what was my last employment—my last aspiration. Oh Emma! Emma! my life, my love!—</P>
<P>Here he fell on the bosom of Emma, and would <HI>indeed</HI> have died had he known it was Emma that sup∣ported him.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="117"/>She pressed his hand. She could not speak. To the Omnipotent Fa∣ther of Mercy she cast the imploring eye!</P>
<P>Let not the human heart give up its confidence in Heaven. It is never too late to trust!</P>
<P>A team now past within sight of this disconsolate pair. They were laden with provisions and apparel drawn in sledges, and small waggons, and were on their way to three detachments of soldiers, (who had applied to the Ge∣neral for these accommodations) that were stationed on the north side of the forest. Amongst this groupe were also some cattle, of which some were
<PB N="120" REF="118"/>
cows. It is unnecessary to say what use the unwearied Emma made of these: her winning address, and the moving simplicity of her grief, joined to the wretched situation of an En∣glish officer who appeared to be almost at the point of death, gained so en∣tirely upon the soldiers and people who attended the sledges and wag∣gons, that they adminstered whatever could promote the wish of Emma, and even furnished her with a sledge, a mule, and a guide, to carry Captain Hammond to John's-Town.</P>
<P>Thus providentially saved from death a <HI>second</HI> time, I shall not trouble you with other difficulties in the pas∣sage, or in the progress of Henry's re∣covery,
<PB N="121" REF="119"/>
though the least of these were enough to immortalize Emma Cor∣bett bett; but I shall convey your imagi∣nation to John's-Town, where Henry and his protecor at last arrived, and found Sir Robert Raymond recovered from his fever, and just about to set out again in pursuit of Emma.</P>
<P>To her assiduous cares were now superadded those of this excellent man, and Henry became in a short time the nurseling of both. He could walk, converse, and his wound was healing. Emma's dear perilous experiment was guarded—the prospect clear on every side. One afternoon Sir Robert gra∣dually prepared. Henry for the softest surprize that could touch the heart of
<PB N="122" REF="120"/>
a lover; he discovered himself to be the friend of Mr. Corbett—he assu∣red Henry that he saw Emma in good health a little before he left England —he asserted, in the strongest terms, her constancy, her attachment, her love—and said that such was the force of her affection he should not wonder some day or other to hear that she was arrived in America.</P>
<P>—<HI>Yes,</HI> and in America she <HI>is</HI> arri∣ved, cried she (entering at this mo∣ment, agreeable to the plan concerted) She <HI>is</HI> arrived—she is <HI>here</HI>—she is now in the presence of her beloved Henry —she now offers him the hand of Emma for EVER!</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="121"/>Emma was yet in her boy's apparel, but had washed the stain from her lovely countenance, and discovered enough to throw Henry first upon his knee to the restoring God, and then into arms of this tenderest of women.</P>
<P>You will not expect I should tell you what <HI>either</HI> felt at that moment! You will not expect I should describe the series of delicious sorrow and gra∣tulations which followed, while all the enterprizes of Emma were relating to Henry. He found himself the most blest, most honoured, and most beloved of men! He found Emma all that language <HI>cannot</HI> express. He found—</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="122"/>—in short, it was a false rumour you see that reached Emma at John's-Town, respecting the death of Henry. He was reserved for Emma to disco∣ver and to restore.</P>
<P>He is discovered, he is restored.—Emma is now before him—Emma the most generous, most—</P>
<P>—Oh Mr. Corbett! Henry is the happiest of mankind. He now TELLS you that he is—<HI>he</HI> dictates these explanatory sheets—they flow from his grateful heart—the tenderest mer∣cies of Providence have been upon him; they are to be seen—they may be felt: you will no longer refuse to give him the hand of Emma! ah that
<PB N="125" REF="123"/>
he were worthy of her. Disclose, he beseeches you, these tender circum∣stances to Louisa, his sister. Oh he can hold no longer, he is too, too happy; he takes the pen from the amanuensis and— No! it is not necessary to sign the letter. The wri∣ter is now known.</P>

<HEAD>TO C. CORBETT, ESQ.</HEAD>
<P>THE blessings of Providence are at length manifest; since the pacquet from Henry, must, ere this, be come to hand. It is not easy to tell
<PB N="126" REF="124"/>
you how totally I have in <HI>them</HI> anni∣hilated <HI>myself,</HI> for many days past. Henry recovers apace. The attenti∣ons of Emma, indeed, so pointed and so pure, might almost raise him from the dead. Yet I almost envy her the share she has had in this discovery, and all its happy consequences. I can scarce forgive my illness for seizing me at such a time. It is Emma alone who has been the saviour of Henry. It is Henry only who can merit such salvation. You can image to your∣self nothing so tender as his gratitude, so warm as his affections, or so perfect as his delicacy. From his somewhat military style of address I expected not this, and am equally surprised and delighted. Yes, my dear old com∣panion,
<PB N="127" REF="125"/>
you have yet a daughter, and will, in a few days, boast also—</P>
<P>Oh my friend, how infinitely I fall beneath the standard of my ambition! How incorrect is human virtue! How frail is human fortitude! The pros∣pect of Henry's becoming your SON, does not charm this rebel heart half so sincerely as it ought to do; and yet, heaven is witness that I am doing every thing to advance his health and his happiness.</P>
<P>Self-interested, perhaps, still. I doat on promoting the felicity of Emma by any means. I am proud to please her. I consider the youth of Henry, and wish it the joys it is formed
<PB N="128" REF="126"/>
to taste. I reflect on my own age, and think that I am too silly to be pardoned. I am entirely convinced of my folly, and yet hug it to my heart. Ah Mr. Corbett, what is there in that subtle and active principle which we thus feed in our bosoms, and which turns, serpent-like, against the nourisher? It stings, and we are not angry: it tortures, and we do not, <HI>cannot</HI> command it to depart from us. Something, like the healing balm, flows into the wound, and recompen∣ses us for all we suffer. The misery which is the consequence of a tender∣ness like mine, is compounded of such sweet ingredients, that it is not in the nature of the tender heart to wish it were removed. And yet, my friend,
<PB N="129" REF="127"/>
it is most intense. I have found the vanity of attempting to argue myself into neutrality. It is virtue and beauty that have attracted—that have bound me! Ere a soul like mine can free itself from <HI>such</HI> captivity, the en∣chanting powers of its object must change; its beauty become defor∣mity, and its virtue vice. 'Tis out of the question. The great point of moral propriety is in every man's power, and consequently in mine. The human heart loves as it listeth—it sees its bias, and trembles towards it: but society, religion, and the laws, are all to be respected, and he who presumes to overleap these, renders himself contemptible.

<P><PB N="140" REF="138"/>Hitherto all has been well—all has been great and glorious. You still assure me you can act the only part that remains. Of that I am not to be told. Yet your friendship is attended by so much suffering, so much pier∣cing sensbility, that even at this blest moment my heart bleeds for you.</P>
<P>If you will—oh hard request—if you will gently withdraw yourself for a time only, till you have gained com∣posure, I will defer—I will frame some fresh excuses to Henry for my—</P>

more. I know your friendship will insist upon my fulfilling to the utmost every duty in life, and every engage∣ment. Should this, therefore, be the last letter that passes between us, I conjure you to believe, that of every petition, of every fervent prayer that I offer to heaven, your health and your happiness will form a part. I did not think it possible that any thing could fall out to make me wretched, with the immediate prospect of being united to Henry; and yet such is my genuine esteem for you, Sir Robert, that I cannot be perfectly happy while I am conscious of creating misery to one of the noblest of mankind. Henry enters, and I can say no more.</P>

<P>It is absurd. Henry Hammond is formed for Emma. I will muse upon my obstinate weakness, and become once more a reasonable creature—I will indeed, my dear old friend! give me a little time.</P>

<P>I do not propose returning to Phi∣ladelphia for some days.</P>
<P>'Tis a dreary uncomfortable night. I am here too in a large apartment alone. Sighs burst from my bosom, and tears fall from my eyes, without any apparent cause. The effect of a thick drisly atmosphere perhaps—</P>

<P>Corbett, what can be the reason of it?

<HEAD>TO C. CORBETT, ESQ.</HEAD>
<P>I RECEIVED your congratulati∣ons; I received your blessing; and to crown the <HI>whole</HI> of human happi∣ness, I have received the hand of your daughter. Yet my transport has hur∣ried me into an expression too bold. Oh I am a mortal still, Mr. Corbett: still am I vulnerable in a vital part. The fearful accounts you have trans∣mitted of my poor sister, and of your <HI>own</HI> declining health, alarm and wound me. Hapless Louisa! dear relict of the generous Edward! Ah that we had you both here, nursed by our care, and protected under the shelter of our most affectionate emb∣races.
<PB N="152" REF="150"/>
Sir Robert Raymond too, our second father, and our first of friends, would rejoice at this. Yet <HI>he</HI> keeps aloof from us. He used to be enamoured of our society, and now the deepest solitudes have seduced him from us. In vain I invite, in vain I implore. He is melancholy: he is mournful. Is there a cause for this? Ah that I could remove it! I have now been six weeks in the posses∣sion of Emma Corbett. She is my wife! God of Heaven how I thrill with gratitude! Yet oh, Supreme Bestower of every good, if it were thy divine pleasure to restore my sister and my friends—if it be consistent with that awful design into whose depths I presume not to pry, to extend to <HI>these</HI>

<HEAD>LETTER CXXXVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD>TO C. CORBETT, ESQ.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE brought my pulses to be almost as obedient as I wish them. Reason is not so weak a power as we make her appear. Her province is perhaps, misunderstood, my friend. It is not tyranny, but a mild and <HI>genial</HI> authority, which she should exercise. The subjects of her sway are the pas∣sions; those of the <HI>tender</HI> kind are with the most difficulty governed.</P>
<P>I have applied to this our intellec∣tual sovereign on a different principle. I implored her, not to inspire me with that <HI>indifference</HI> which is the usual prayer of the disappointed. The ob∣ject
<PB N="155" REF="153"/>
of my love is married to the man of her heart. She obtained him at the price of almost unparalleled hazards. I saw every hope of possession cut off. It was an intolerable agony. I bore it till I became almost desperate. I indulged the passion even till the in∣dissoluble bonds were tied against me. I saw the madness of my pursuit, and retired—retired, my dear Corbett, not to meditate revenge against a happy rival, but to manage my own wretch∣edness, and to <HI>think.</HI></P>
<P>A serious appeal from the passions to the judgment is seldom made in vain. We miscarry, chiefly because we are <HI>not</HI> serious, but only <HI>suppose</HI> ourselves so.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="154"/>I selected a quiet hour, and laid the simple facts before me. They were not elaborate. The woman of my affection (thus I argued) is now hap∣pily married. She is generous enough to pity and respect me for misery that she hath very unwillingly occasioned. Accidents have confirmed what Cor∣bett at first betrayed. I have too much contributed to her present hap∣piness for her to treat me untenderly: and yet my farther intimacy will in∣crease her distress, even if it does not spread itself in time to her husband. How bitterly does she pay for my for∣mer services! What hinders her, now that she is in the arms of Henry, from looking upon my passion as in∣sulting and impious? Those very
<PB N="157" REF="155"/>
services. Do I then presume, and persecute her upon these? Oh in∣delicacy! oh folly!</P>
<P>But can I conquer my affection? No. It is not possible; it is not ne∣cessary. To <HI>extinguish bad</HI> passions, and to <HI>regulate good</HI> ones, are the two great points within the compass of reason. To covet any longer the <HI>person</HI> of Emma would be infamous. It is an inhibition of law, of religion, and of God. But, are the merely sen∣sual passions then at my age so very gross, that by no exertion, no interest, I can subdue them? What will be the consequence of my persisting? The distress of Emma, who now should taste only of joy, the suspicion of
<PB N="158" REF="156"/>
Henry, whose heart melts in grati∣tude towards me, and my own con∣scious upbraiding. Can I <HI>sustain</HI> these, or is an obstinate attachment to the only point which reason refuses me (and which, after all, is hopeless,) strong enough to support me? But <HI>what</HI> then am I to do? Does reason bring with her no compensations—no equipoise of rewards for punishments so severe? She does, and MANY. Shall I not rank amongst those the delights of a friendship not less <HI>tender</HI> though less <HI>interested</HI>—the <HI>secret</HI>-breathed prayer for one human being whose happiness is dearer to <HI>me</HI> than that of any other upon the earth—the gene∣rous sigh—the softening tear—the so∣cial smile—the self-gratulation—the
<PB N="159" REF="157"/>
flush of virtue, pleased with <HI>herself</HI>—the smile of Emma—the assent of HEAVEN?</P>
<P>Oh Mr. Corbett, we have glorious faculties, had we the resolution to exert them. We are afraid to <HI>begin.</HI> The heart trembles at a view of its labour. We venture to climb the steep, and are dismayed. But every difficulty of soul and body diminishes by earnest perseverance. However cragged the mountain, or slippery its path, every effort brings us nearer to the summit; the second step is easier than the first, the third is smoother than the second. It is the motive of climbing that gives us fortitude. When the motive is <HI>so great</HI> as to concern the happiness of
<PB N="160" REF="158"/>
others, and our own duty is included, surely we should struggle to ascend. <HI>I,</HI> Corbett, <HI>have</HI> struggled—I cannot say how much or how long, but I can and do tell you, in the sincerity of my soul, that though I am not, nor perhaps shall EVER be again a <HI>happy</HI> man, I do not wish either the death of Henry, or the alienation of his Emma's affection. I can support the presence of both, when softness and wedded love sits <HI>fairest</HI> upon their features. And, tho' many a rising tear warns me that it is time to retire, no sentiment of irre∣gular desire invades my heart. Henry cultivates my friendship with kindest care; I do not impute to him, his <HI>happiness</HI> as his <HI>fault.</HI> I recede not from his embrace, though I seldom
<PB N="161" REF="159"/>
make advances to conversation that relates to Emma: and yet Emma is his perpetual subject, and his darling theme. Her own conduct is such as corresponds with every part of her former life. Perhaps there never was a more affecting situation than she has to perform whenever I am present. It is indeed too much for a nature so gentle, and so ingenuous. But I will remove the effect, by removing the cause. Humanity should not <HI>presume</HI> to be perfect. I have carried a con∣quest as far, perhaps, as it can go. I have acquired strength by an exami∣nation of weakness. Let me not sink into captivity by fool-hardiness. I have done much. In attempting more, I may lose all the laurels I have
<PB N="162" REF="160"/>
won. Involuntary thoughts will tres∣pass on the firmest mind. Emma is a tender wife, a tender friend. Hea∣ven continue her so, while earth hath a feeling to make life desirable. But the familiar intercourse of a private family is somewhat too much for me at present. I constrain Emma when∣ever I visit her, and nature impells my steps towards Philadelphia but too often—to appear restrained. I beg you will tell my steward to prepare Castleberry for my reception. I will return to England. There is no dan∣ger of a reiapse; but I am obliged to repeat the rescuing arguments too of∣ten. A few months absence will compleat my work. Henry and his WIFE—I wish, Corbett, I could write
<PB N="163" REF="161"/>

<P>We are upon our return. Emma is very commodiously situated. She has a cabbin to herself. All that art could do in medicine has been at∣tempted.</P>
<P>It is in vain—</P>

<P>I went a little while ago into the cabbin, and found your lovely one, anticipating all the tender providence of a mother. She was employed in those soft cares which the prospect—the very near prospect—of her travail justified.</P>
<P>—a little white robe or wrapper lay on the table finished before her.</P>
<P>—she had begun to plait the cap.</P>
<P>—if these, Sir Robert (said she) should ever become useful—if I should follow my husband ere I can suckle

his child at this faithful bosom, do not forget—I conjure you do not—if the little wretch should live—do not forget to tell it that it was a mother's hand which prepared the mantle that first wrapped its tender form. Tell it, that for its dear sake I would have <HI>lived</HI> had it been possible—</P>
<P>Then pausing a little, the ex∣claimed—and here is my husband's picture—in that trunk are Emma's letters—yonder is the man's apparel in which I sought for my poor Henry. These legacies of love, (the pledges of a parent's fidelity) I bequeath my child, happen what may. They can∣not but be precious. Will they not be valued, think you, Sir Robert?</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="186"/>She perceived that my distress was too great.</P>
<P>Sir Robert Raymond, I glory in your attachment; I glory in your friendship. Had the world contained, or could it <HI>ever</HI> contain, any man in the eyes of Emma, but he who sleeps beneath its surface, it is not a ques∣tion who would have captivated her heart!</P>
<P>At what a time was this spoken! Oh, Mr. Corbett, the single sensation of that moment was worth a miriad of vulgar lives.</P>

For Heaven's sake, exert yourself to meet your daughter. —Let me prepare you for her appear∣ance. Be not too much alarmed at her languor.

<HEAD>LETTER CXLIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD>TO FREDERICK BERKLEY, ESQ.</HEAD>
<P>THE inclosed rough draft of let∣ters will enable you, O, my friend, to trace the vestiges of some unhappy human beings since their departure from London to their return.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="189"/>At present, fortune seems to con∣tinue our wretchedness by means the most complicate and inventive.</P>
<P>Two hours ago we arrived at the house of the unfortunate Corbett. It was with the utmost difficulty his daughter reached town.</P>
<P>The first object that struck her was a HEARSE standing close beside her father's door. In the passage she be∣held the undertakers bearing a coffin down stairs. The woe-worn Corbett was supported between two servants, to take his last mournful leave of the friend whose remains were about to be deposited. He could not move. He had not received my letter from Ports∣mouth,
<PB N="190" REF="190"/>
dispatched three days before. It had been miss-sent. The letter did not come to hand till two hours after our arrival. He was not PREPARED to receive us.</P>
<P>Our chaise drew up still closer. Emma rushed out.—The poor old man—the daughter.—</P>
<P>—We are not provided with a language to express these horrors.—</P>
<P>Almost an hour the child and parent remained speechless—it was surprise and agony, at once dumb and dreadful.</P>
<P>The hearse waited. The coffin was placed in it, and shut up.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="191"/>The bell is at this instant tolling for POOR LOUISA: The sexton is come to tell the attendants that the clergy∣man is waiting. Wretched wife of Edward! She died distracted. The hearse is driving off.</P>
<P>What a house is here! Alas, it has long and truly been the house of mourning!</P>
<P>Corbett and Emma are still toge∣ther in the next room to that in which I write. The servants look amaze∣ment and dismay.</P>
<P>I hear, methinks, the voice of my aged associate in friendship and in sor∣row.
<PB N="192" REF="192"/>
I am called suddenly and has∣tily.—</P>
<P>Oh friend, oh Berkley: to what am I reserved! A PREMATURE LABOUR has been brought on by hurry, agita∣tion, and fatigue. This morning's sun sees Emma a mother of a <HI>living</HI> child.—The poison seems not to have been in the least degree communi∣cated to this precious pledge. It is a female.</P>
<P>Alas! Emma would leap for joy at this circumstance; she would forget awhile her woes in viewing the babe whom Henry had bequeathed.—She would present it with some testimony of maternal transport to her drooping
<PB N="193" REF="193"/>
father.—But that—even Henry's off∣spring can no longer soothe—for EMMA CORBETT IS <HI>dead.</HI>—Her death instantly succeeded the pangs of the birth. It happened at midnight.—Her frame must have dropped in con∣sequence of the venom, which resisted the force and subtilty of all applica∣tion.—Soon—too soon— would the fair victim of constancy have sunk to the tomb; but these precipitating agonies added to the rest:—Oh they were too much. She fell before them.</P>
<P>In the expiring moment she called me to her—"'Tis Emma's infant▪ take it, said she: it is a parting gift—I <HI>can</HI> no more—my father—my poor father!"—</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="194"/>She dropped upon the pillow, from which she twice vainly endeavoured to raise her head, and lift her eye to the objects about her—THEN BREATHED HER LAST.</P>
<P>Thus lived, and thus died, the most faithful and beautiful of women.</P>
<P>Charles Corbett stands fixed over the corpse of his daughter.</P>
<P>The old man is now bereft of all! "I am childless, Sir Robert, (he ex∣claims)—Behold what CIVIL WAR has done for me."—</P>
<P>Berkley, I have kissed the clay-cold lips—I have pressed the clay-cold
<PB N="195" REF="195"/>
hand. On that bed—that very bed—</P>
<P>—but I dare not indulge reflec∣tion. <HI>Pierced</HI> as I am, I would fain preserve a decent sorrow. Ah that I were in my grave! Impious wish! Is there a single point of space in the petty allotment of man, in which something important is not to be done?</P>
<P>Yon aged forlorn one, now weeping over his child, looks up to me alone for something which resembles com∣fort, during the wretched residue of life.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="196"/>The funeral obsequies of Emma are yet to be performed—</P>
<P>The widow of Edward hath left a son—</P>
<P>The widow of Henry a daughter—</P>
<P>I will not die till Heaven's ap∣pointed hour: I have much occasion still for life.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CXLIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD>TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>I AM just come from the most ago∣nizing ceremony, oh Frederick, that can possibly pass under the eye of man!—May you never feel what otherwise you can never know! Easy in your fortunes, quiet in your situa∣tion, unconnected in your interests, you can, happily for you, have no conception—at least no perfect one—of that rend in the heart which is made by death, when youth, innocence, and beauty, is committed to the dust—when the parent hangs his drooping head over the last sad tenement—when the orphans—</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="198"/>Whatever I said? Youth, inno∣cence, and beauty!—and do <HI>all</HI> these then go down to the earth's cold bo∣som? Shall none of them ascend? The glooms of the soul almost carry sensation into sin! They shall ALL as∣cend! The <HI>one</HI> shall ensure everlasting existence to the <HI>others.</HI> Innocence shall immortalize beauty and youth.</P>
<P>I am reasoning with an almost breaking heart, Berkley; while poor old Corbett, the survivor of his fa∣mily, in all the solemn pathos of grief, forgets every pain of body in nursing that which is seated within. The ro∣mance of youth may teach you to ex∣pect that I should execrate—that I should summon to my assistance every
<PB N="199" REF="199"/>
infernal power—that I should tax heaven itself with cruelty, and take refuge from altercating man, amidst the friendly concealment of impene∣trable woods. This may, perhaps, answer the purpose of the novellist, but it corresponds not with the nature of your friend. No, Berkley. It is not in a moment like this that the truly touched and truly tender indulge themselves in outrage. The first burst is past: that which began with loudness, with vehemence, and with vociferation, settles into the still, the solemn, and the affecting. The temper, stormy and headstrong, of Corbett himself, terminates in the eloquence of dumb distress. The tears fall fast from me as I write.
<PB N="200" REF="200"/>
More <HI>impetuous</HI> periods I have felt so <HI>awful</HI> and so <HI>affecting</HI> a crisis never did I experience. You, who knew not Emma, and have not a regular though you have a worthy heart, can∣not know what I have lost. The manner of her death—the motive—and the whole tenour of circumstan∣ces connected with it, throw over every passage of the scene, a colour so movingly sad, that I sit wonder-struck in the room, and seem almost in my grave, with the world about me. I have exerted myself to say thus much at the winding up of this so∣lemn catastrophe, lest you, my dear Barkley, or any other person, into whose hands these incidents may fall, should presume to question the ways
<PB N="201" REF="201"/>
of ALMIGHTY GOD, which are justi∣fiable in every part of this pathetic story. Erroneous notions of punish∣ment and reward, are perhaps the leading steps to irreligion and infide∣lity. The vile herd of novellists have done an essential injury to the cause of virtue, by sacrificing to the pleasure of the reader, beyond the simplicity of truth. Difficulty, in the beginning of a narrative; love, in the middle; and marriages, at the end, make up, almost invariably, the recipe of a mo∣dern romance. This is called reward∣ing virtue; a bad character or two, perhaps, drops off, and that is called punishing vice. False, foolish, con∣clusion! Look into life. Doth not heaven's blessed beam shine equally
<PB N="202" REF="202"/>
on the just and the unjust. Are all rewards so mechanically contrived? Hath virtue no joys of her <HI>own?</HI>—joys, which generous sorrow only can produce? Is the sacred struggle of a good man <HI>altogether afflictive?</HI> To pass through a road perplexed and thorny—to travel through a hard and difficult life, without tearing the finer principles from the heart, doth it re∣quire no better conduct than moves in the machinery of those contempti∣ble pages where all is given up to letter'd art, and distorted imagina∣tion? Are there no sweets in the pensive sigh—the pious tear? Break they from the mourner without offer∣ing him <HI>any</HI> balm? Hath heaven-born constancy no comforts? Consi∣der
<PB N="203" REF="203"/>
the life of Emma! Hath death, at once virtuous and christian, nothing to lift the survivor's spirit above every care of vulgar being? Oh Frederick, I am touched by a very tender exam∣ple. In lamenting as I <HI>now</HI> lament, say my friend, is there <HI>no</HI> dear and welcome mitigations? Yes, I feel—I <HI>feel</HI> that there are. Would I part with this generous grief?—Ah no! What would I take in exchange?—The universe should not buy it from me. I even anticipate the holy satis∣faction when I shall steal from the shout and strife of society, to the tomb of a virtuous woman. Think you I love her less because I no more shall see her? Hath she suffered in my esteem <HI>by her ascension into heaven?</HI>
<PB N="204" REF="204"/>
Shall she lose as an angel, what as a mortal she acquired? I love her bet∣ter. The Omnipotent placed her in the path of my life, to fix and concen∣trate the best of passions. I am not of disposition or age to change again. Oh that the daughter of Emma may live! Shall I be content with a pa∣rent's <HI>common</HI> duty—to cloathe, to feed, to educate? Consider Barkley, <HI>whose</HI> babe it is!</P>
<P>I have hurried down stairs to exa∣mine my treasure!</P>
<P>—it lives, it sleeps. I have felt its gentle breath on my cheek.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="205"/>God will spare it. <HI>Louisa</HI>'s orphan too is mine. <HI>Corbett</HI> too shall live. I have moved towards his bed-side often, since I began to write. His face is hid—he will not yet endure existence, but the hours of resignation are at hand.</P>
<P>I conjure you then Berkley to <HI>settle</HI> your opinions about Providence.—Bring your piety to a point.—Culti∣vate your tenderness.—Love, like Emma; and if you meet with <HI>such</HI> a disappointment, do not <HI>transfer</HI> your affection, but turn it to a generous ac∣count. The <HI>vulgar</HI> effect of tender distress, is dissipation or despair. Had <HI>I</HI> yielded to these, a poor old man would have wanted a friend;
<PB N="206" REF="206"/>
two lovely infants, a parent; and I the self-approving <HI>bosom-ray,</HI> which chears my spirit in this vale of sorrow.</P>
<P><HI>Circumscribe</HI> not, therefore, the re∣wards of Heaven. The writer of a romance would paint me as a wretch without hope, who calls down the stroke of fate in pity to his aid. At∣tend <HI>you</HI> to the reality, my friend; and behold a man who wishes still to live! and who thinks himself rewarded.</P>
