<P>THE LADY OF THE MANOR, A COMIC OPERA: AS IT IS PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE-ROYAL IN COVENT-GARDEN.</P>
<P>WRITTEN BY DR. KENRICK.</P>
<P>THE SONGS SET TO MUSIC BY MR. HOOK.</P>
<P>LONDON: PRINTED FOR E. AND C. DILLY IN THE POULTRY; J. WILKIE, IN ST. PAUL'S CHURCH-YARD; T. DA∣VIES, IN GREAT RUSSEL-STREET, COVENT-GARDEN, AND J. WALTER, CHARING-CROSS. MDCCLXXVIII.</P>

<PB REF="3"/>
<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE outline of the following Opera (written about ten years ago, by way of relaxation from severer studies) was taken from the <HI>Country Lasses</HI> of Mr. <HI>Charles Johnson,</HI> particularly the pleasing and romantic episode, borrowed from the <HI>Custom of the Country</HI> of <HI>Beaumont and Fletcher.</HI></P>
<P>The author, in accommodating his plan to the present taste, was led, of course, to reject the revolting absurdity of supposing the custom in question still to subsist.</P>
<P><PB REF="4"/>The considerable alterations and addi∣tions, also, which he found it expedient to make, both in the plot and dialogue, have so much diversified the whole, that it has been as <HI>truly</HI> as <HI>ill-naturedly</HI> ob∣served, <Q>the piece resembles a coat, stolen a second time from a thief, so metamorphosed, that the very tay∣lor, who first cut it out, would not know the handy-work of his own shears.</Q></P>
<P>It is no wonder that, in this age of <HI>originality,</HI> so many <HI>truly-original</HI> cri∣tics, who never play at <HI>rob-thief</HI> them∣selves, should sufficiently rally him on so artful and complete a transformation, He cannot help thinking, however, that these <HI>very honest</HI> gentlemen are a little unreasonable in expecting him to do such <HI>great things</HI> merely for his <HI>amusement,</HI> as are done by those who make play∣writing their serious <HI>occupation.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="5"/>If, therefore, this opera hath hitherto met with an approbation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If it afford any consolation to the professional dramatists, who envy him this approbation, they may rest satisfied, he is by no means disposed even to amuse himself any more the same way.</NOTE> as general as even the best of their most elabo∣rate productions; the author cannot but impute it to the excellent acting of the theatrical performers, and the elegant taste of the musical composer.</P>

<STAGE>SCENE <HI>a fertile Country. A Gentleman's Seat at the top of a Hill, and a Farm-house in the Center of the Scene, at the Bottom.</HI></STAGE>
<STAGE>The Scene rises, and discovers Lady <HI>Lucy</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Town∣ly,</HI> dressed, like Country Lasses, accompanied by Sheep-shearers, Men and Maidens, dancing and singing in Chorus.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>HAPPY Britons! while we shear</L>
<L>Our silver fleeces once a year,</L>

<L>A wond'rous tale, my friends, we're told,</L>
<L>How, from some <HI>foreign</HI> shore,</L>
<L>To <HI>Grecce</HI> of old,</L>
<L>A fleece of gold,</L>
<L>Advent'rous <HI>Jason</HI> bore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet murmur not, my honest swains,</L>

<L>Not less our gains,</L>
<L>Whose peaceful plains</L>

<L>More richly doth our pains requite</L>
<L>The harvest of the fold,</L>

<SPEAKER>Lady <HI>Lucy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>So, you are heartily tired of your fro∣lick, I see—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Town.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed I am, my dear.</P>
<STAGE>They come forward.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady <HI>Lucy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And was this fatiguing amusement all the pleasure you promised yourself from this wild pro∣ject, of our leaving the manor-house, and passing, in this disguise, under the names of Flora and Laura, for re∣lations of farmer Sternold? I hope you do not intend to romp about with these good folks again to-morrow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Town.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, child, I was only willing to have another taste of your rural diversions before I left the country. And I promise you, I am fully satisfied of
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
their rusticity. I wish I could prevail on you to ac∣company me to London.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady <HI>Lucy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What to do there?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Town.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>To see and converse with human crea∣tures, my dear; for I cannot look upon the things, that have just parted from us, in any other light than as a kind of intermediate beings between men and brutes; they are certainly of an inferior nature to people who live in London.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady <HI>Lucy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, in the metropolis every thing is false, frivolous and artificial; while <HI>here</HI> all things appear in the plain and unaffected dress of nature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY LUCY.</SPEAKER>
<LG>
<L><HI>Simplicity,</HI> daughter of <HI>Truth,</HI></L>
<L>In <HI>Modesty</HI>'s vesture array'd,</L>
<L><HI>Here</HI> breathes the fond hope of the <HI>youth,</HI></L>
<L>And whispers the wish of the <HI>maid.</HI></L>

<L><HI>There, Artifice,</HI> son of <HI>Deceit,</HI></L>
<L>In impudent foppery dress'd,</L>
<L>With <HI>Innocence</HI> playing the cheat,</L>
<L>Still makes of true passion a jest.</L>
</LG>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Town.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, my dear Lucy, people, bred in society, are as preferable to these clowns as angels are to mere mortals.—How long do you think to live in this wilderness, before you get a husband, as I did, by accident?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady <HI>Lucy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I should hope never; were I so soon to lose him again as you did, by accident.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Town.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why not, my dear, if, like mine, he were as well lost as found? The man dropped from the clouds, to please my papa; and, taking pet at the world, returned back again—to please me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER>Lady <HI>Lucy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>They say, indeed, that marriages are made in heaven.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Town.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; but they say too, they are strange∣ly broke in coming down.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady <HI>Lucy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>In London, perhaps, where the multi∣plicity of objects puzzles the choice. But, out of the few that drop here in the country, we may soon re∣solve to catch one; and be assured, my dear Townly, that when the right man comes, I shall not let him slip through my fingers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Townly.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, there's not much choice in the whole sex. A man's but a man, make the most of him. Mine, they say, was one of the best of them, and you see I survived his loss.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady <HI>Lucy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You are too young and giddy, to take any thing to heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Town.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>True, cousin, I wore the willow only with my weeds, and that not a weeping willow neither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady <HI>Lucy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You are a wild rake, Townly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Town.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>We widows have a privilege, child—But women are all rakes at heart; so, at least the poet says: nay, I'll answer for it, that with all your sim∣plicity, you have your female rakes in the country, as well as we in town.</P>

<L>Delightful is a rural life,</L>

</LG>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Town.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>To be serious, my dear Lady Lucy, I cannot conceive how any woman, who has youth, beau∣ty, and fortune at command, as you have, can take de∣light in wandering, like a wild thing, about the woods, in gloomy groves and dismal shades; when she might display her charms to so much greater advantage in the glittering circle of the Pantheon, or the brilliant vistas of Vauxhall.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady <HI>Lucy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And I can as little conceive how any woman, of sense or taste, can be taken with the artifi∣cial amusements of the town, when she might enjoy the pleasure of breathing the fresh air, and contem∣plating the beauties of nature, in the country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Townly.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And you do really prefer the pitiful employment of dangling after a flock of simple sheep, to the superlative delight of having a flock of simple admirers dangling after you!—As I live, here they are!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady <HI>Lucy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Who? What?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Town.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Men, men, my dear, social beings!—See, they are coming over the stile! My heart flutters at the sight of them; does not yours?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady <HI>Lucy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Strangers, and well dressed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Town.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Two of our London beaus: Sir John Manly and young Wildman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady <HI>Lucy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>My cousin Wildman!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Town.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The same, my dear. You don't know much of him, it seems.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady <HI>Lucy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>My uncle has ever kept him at such a distance, that I have not seen him since he was a school∣boy: nor do I believe Sir Wilful himself would know his nephew, any more than I. He has not suffered the young spark to come into his presence, since his return from his travels.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Town.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What can have brought them hither? Let us retire behind this thicket; perhaps we may learn their errand. <STAGE>They retire behind a thicket.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter Sir <HI>John Manly</HI> and Young <HI>Wildman.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Manly.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>[Speaking to his Servants without.]</STAGE> Well, get the carriage round to the farm-house, yonder in the bottom. We'll walk across the fields, and meet you. <STAGE>[To Wild.]</STAGE> What an unlucky accident! We are not, it seems, above a mile or two from the manor-house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>It will be impossible, however, to get our da∣mage repaired time enough to reach it to-night. But no matter, the news of our disaster will get there be∣fore us, and, my word for it, when the good Baronet, my uncle, comes to be informed that the coach of a man of fashion hath broken down, in crossing the country to pay him a visit, he'll give us an opportuni-of profiting by our misfortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Manly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be it so then: I am ever for making a vir∣tue of necessity. In the mean time, George, you will have the pleasure of spending the night with your dear∣ly beloved mistress, <HI>Variety:</HI> you shall sleep, for once, on a truss of clean straw, in a farmer's barn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, any thing for a change in life. I am satisfied, so we tread not continually the same track of insipid pleasures as in London, where our amusements,
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>
like the company at Ranelagh, move round and round for ever in a circle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILDMAN.</SPEAKER>
<LG>
<L>The <HI>dog</HI> in a wheel, and the <HI>horse</HI> in a mill,</L>
<L>The <HI>squirrel</HI> with bells on his cage,</L>
<L>Thus run the same round of <HI>mere drudgery</HI> still,</L>
<L>So <HI>dull</HI> is the taste of the age!</L>
</LG>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Manly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truce with your common-place raillery. Variety, indeed, is the pleasure of life, but not the comfort of it. I'll hold you a wager, you'll not sleep so soundly in a barn, as you would at a bagnio.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not the first night, perhaps; but custom would inure me to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Manly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right—Habit only makes things easy and familiar. This removes every inconvenience, and makes us look even on danger and distress with indiffe∣rence.</P>

<L>Luxurious lords, on beds of down,</L>

<L>Nay, blythe, the sea-boy reefs the sail,</L>

<P>This is pretty moralizing, Manly. But, come, now we are so near our journey's end, let us rightly understand each other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Manly.</SPEAKER>
<P>By all means.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>You agree, then, that if, in consequence of this visit to my whimsical uncle, you should approve of his niece, get into her good graces, and marry her,
<PB N="8" REF="14"/>
you will advance me a moiety of that lady's portion, to be repaid on the death of Sir Wilful, should he die intestate; and, in case of a will, partial either to ne∣phew or niece, that we share his fortune equally be∣tween us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Manly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Exactly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wildman.</SPEAKER>
<P>On the other hand, if you should dislike, or decline to pay your addresses to the lady—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Manly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never fear, George: as I have determined to take up and look out for a wife, she will be certain∣ly my choice. I was struck when I had a sight of her once, at Litchfield races, and have heard such encomi∣ums on her wit, beauty and understanding, since, that I am half in love with her already: so let us get what accommodation we can to-night, and to-morrow pro∣ceed to business. <STAGE>Exeunt.</STAGE></P>

<P>Nay, child, there's nothing in that. People must have some way of coming together: and if your cousin helps you to a good husband, I think you are greatly obliged to him.</P>

<P>Come, come, I'll tell you, in a few plain words, what honourable design you are bent upon.

<P>She is, Sir, and very deservedly; but you'll hardly have an opportunity of seeing her, unless you make some stay in these parts: she is at present gone a visiting somewhere, with a rantipole young widow of quality, that came down from London about a month ago.

<P>A Cleopatra only in beauty, George. You come in good time: I want your advice. Shall I marry this charming little rustic or not?</P>

<P>Marry her, why you are not in love with her, surely?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Manly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, I believe I am—I have strong symp∣toms of it. My heart flutters at the sight of her. She
<PB N="28" REF="34"/>
is constantly in my thoughts. I could fight for her, die for her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poh! that a man might do for an hundred women, he was never in love with. To die for a wo∣man, Manly, is a mere piece of gallantry. But to marry her, boy, is to live for her, a serious piece of bu∣siness, and perhaps with her too, which is—out of fa∣shion, egad, and that is worse than being out of the world by half.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Manly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet that I could bear with Flora.—fame, fortune, friendship, all put into the balance against her, appear light as a feather. My regard for her will be lasting as life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you must die soon, Manly, take my word for it. However, if you have a mind to put your passion to a violent death, you will take the readiest way. Marriage is as certain a remedy for love, as an incurable mortification is for all other disorders.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Manly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't be so severe, George. Her charms will afford an eternal source of pleasure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't believe either in the immortality of her charms, or the eternity of your passion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Manly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look at her again, then, and be converted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Convert thyself, my friend. To marry a wo∣man merely for her beauty, is to enslave your whole body for the gratification only of your eyes. But why nerd you marry her? Give her some gold, man, pro∣mise her more: cheapen her; purchase her; carry her off, as I will do the little lapwing, her cousin: What, the devil, should you encumber yourself with the lease of a house for, when you may rent the best apartments in it, as long as you like, and leave it at pleasure?</P>
</SP>

<P>Poh! poh! you did not come up to her price, I suppose. That's all. I thought, Manly, you had known women better. Besides, consider, you are on the cruise after my cousin Lady Lucy, a twenty thou∣sand pounder! Will you be diverted from the chace of such a noble prize, by such a little smuggling cut∣ter as this? If the free-hearted cock-boat will give herself away willingly, or take a reasonable price for her cargo, well and good.

<P>Well, Sir; as I find your character and in∣tentions are honourable, I am satisfied. I have no other objection to make than the general one against unequal and precipitate marriages. I could wish your affections had been of slower growth, to have taken deeper root. Beauty is like a rich but shallow soil. It is fertile; but I always suspect its sudden shoots come up too hastily to be vigorous or lasting.</P>

<P>Rather suspect the languid affection of the mercenary tribe, who marry only for money.</P>

<P>Well, Sir, if you are so fully determined, I have nothing farther to say; except that, if you mean to be married this morning, (for you have kept us up till past midnight) you must not have much sleep, I can tell you. You must ride some miles, and that expedi∣tiously too, to procure a licence and get tacked toge∣ther within canonical hours.</P>

<P>Not contrary to law?</P>
</SP>

<P>Not to common law; which is founded sole∣ly on custom: and it has been the custom, time out of mind, for us young fellows, whose blood flows brisk∣ly through our veins, to use no ceremony with a whole∣some cherry-cheek'd country wench, wherever we have the opportunity of a barn, bed, hovel, or haycock.</P>

<P>A little agreeable violence is absolutely ne∣cessary on these occasions. It saves a world of alterca∣tion and gives an edge to appetite.</P>

<P>But what is all this to us, Sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Wil.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>True, Sir John, that is as you take it; but the point is, your spouse is the damsel, on whom my kinsman has promised to bestow his bounty, and as he is ready to fulfil his part of the agreement, he thinks he has a right to insist on the performance of covenants on the part of the bride.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Wil.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Gadso, but I am very serious, Sir John. The maiden, never dreaming it would be her lot to meet with a husband, who should object to the condi∣tion of the obligation, thought there was no harm in thus providing herself with something to begin the world with.

<P>I was resolved, Sir, never to venture on a husband, till I was convinced that my person, ra∣rather than my fortune, was his aim. —That proof you have generously given me; and I am rejoiced that I can make you this grateful return. —You must impute the artifices, I have used in procuring this assurance, to the design concerted between you and your friend, for the disposal of both my person and fortune without my consent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Manly.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own it; with blushes I own it. How shall I repay thy generosity? —Give me thy hand, thy lips, thy heart; there let me dwell, and be for ever happy. <STAGE>Embraces her</STAGE>.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Wil.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>There, there; so, so. All's compos'd again. Egad, I was afraid you were non compos, when you talked of meeting a bully here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Manly.</SPEAKER>
<P>By heavens, I encountered an insolent boy, who with fire arms set me at defiance and retired.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady <HI>Lucy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Mrs. Townly, as I live, returning from her expedition against Mr. Wildman; who is in con∣sequence, you see, taken into custody. You must join with us in inflicting a little imaginary punishment too on your friend.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter <HI>Wildman,</HI> guarded by a <HI>Constable</HI> and other country fellows: with Farmer <HI>Sternold,</HI> who goes up to Lady <HI>Lucy</HI> and converses with her aside.</STAGE>

<SPEAKER>Const.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>[To Sir Wilful.]</STAGE> An please your worship, we have apprehended a vagrom here, who has committed a murder, as I may say, in Farmer Sternold's close. And so we have brought him to take his exami∣nation afore your worship, and be committed to gaol.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Wil.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Murder! say you? Whom has he mur∣dered?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Const.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nea, nea, I did na see the dead mon, to be sure, to ask'un. But the fellow and he, beliken, had
<PB N="60" REF="66"/>
some words about their sweethearts, and so he shot'un that's aw.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>[To Wildman.]</STAGE> I always told you, George, what these wild doings would bring you to; but you would still run riot upon every thing. What could you expect?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, faith, we have made a very fine expedi∣tion of it. One of us is married to a jilt, and the other will be hanged for killing her bully.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Wil.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A fair confession. Where's John, clerk! Here, let him make out the fellow's mittimus. I'll dispatch him to the county jail, in an instant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>To the county jail! Sir John, you will be bound for my appearance at the assizes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Manly.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to that, George, I must beg to be excused. I am sorry for you, but a murder is serious affair, and the law must take its course.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Wil.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, certainly—Where's John, clerk! The vagrant stands committed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, Sir, for the sake of your family, I must be so free as to acquaint you who I am. Look at me, Sir, are my features unknown to you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Wil.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Gadso! Where's my spectacles! Let me see—Ay, sure enongh, the very fellow that I commit∣ted to Lincoln jail for horse-stealing! Egad, friend, if yours be a family phiz, it is a very unpromising one, I can assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, Sir, I am your nephew, George Wildman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>My nephew! you George Wildman!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tis too true, Sir Wilful, and I cannot help reflecting on the sagacity of your late prediction. The young gentleman will certainly come to be hanged, as you said.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Wil.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>True, but I did not think I should have the trouble of signing his mittimus.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stern.</SPEAKER>
<P>With your worship's leave; as the culprit
<PB N="61" REF="67"/>
proves to be a kinsman of yours, and I am the only wit∣ness that can convict him; if he should chuse to supply the place of the poor girl's sweetheart he has killed, and marry her, my evidence, you know, on that con∣dition—</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, thou rascally old pandar.</P>

<P>Ay, sirrah, or you shall inherit no farm lands of mine. A farmer's <HI>daughter,</HI> booby! Why every woman is somebody's daughter. But you're out, you rogue, this is Mrs. Townly, Sir, a London lady of fa∣mily and fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mrs. Townly! Nay then I am caught in a snare, I thought I had escaped. Folly, I see, makes one as blind as love; I should else have sooner recol∣lected those features I have so often admired. May I hope, Madam— <STAGE>To Mrs. Townly</STAGE>.</P>
