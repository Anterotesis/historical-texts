<P>TO whom could a work of this kind, which is, a dis∣quisition of what, others have spent a whole life, without the least attention to, be inscribed, with any seeming propriety, if not, to a gentleman, who has, him∣self, passed years, in the re∣searches of literature; but, set∣ting aside its propriety, on this account; the obligations, you, and your lordship's family, have

<HEAD>A TRANSLATION, OF Abbé GIRARD's PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IF society be formed, by the com∣munication of ideas and sentiments, speech, is, undoubtedly, its most es∣sential and most graceful band, being, at once, the pencil of the mind, the image of its operations, and, the inter∣preter of the heart. The more, we go
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>abroad, among men, the more, we per∣ceive, that language, is the true season∣ing of every delight. When all things else fail, or, when, through age, we have no other enjoyment, that of conversa∣tion, will furnish amusement in our latter hours, and, will, at that time, grow more and more satisfactory; as it will, in some measure, make up for the want of those pleasures, we are in∣capable of receiving. In all times, and, on all occasions, speech is delightful: there can be no true happiness, with∣out the joys of the mind; no good fortune, that we do not long to make known; no secret, we do not wish to communicate; no tender sentiment, we are not anxious to declare; no system, we do not thirst to unfold; no evil, we are not eager to complain of; no comfort, without the sympa∣thetic breathings of friendship; no re∣putation, without the voice of renown;
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>in a word, nothing, without the aid of language, at least, nothing, which can satisfy our understandings, or, flatter our inclinations. Who then would be so indolent, as, to pay no attention to the graces, or, so wanting, as, to disregard the power of one faculty, which gives lustre to every other? Apo∣lite nation, can never entertain notions, injurious to true taste. Good education extends her care, equally, to the lan∣guage of a people, as, their morals: she does not confine herself, to the adorn∣ing of the mind, inwardly, with wis∣dom, science, and, virtue; but, la∣bours, also, to grace it, outwardly, by teaching it the art of shewing itself to advantage. Her desire is, that our expressions should correspond with our thoughts, and, that our reputation should be answerable to our merit. Speech, then, deserves our best atten∣tion, and we ought to think ourselves
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>indebted to those, who study its culti∣vation; whether by learned rules, drawn up according to its peculiar ge∣nius, to give a knowledge of it, with precision; or, by judicious criticisms, in order, to preserve its purity, with∣out rejecting the new advantages, of which, it is susceptible; or, by such useful acquisitions, as may enrich it, without rendering it unintelligible. But how much should we be obliged to that person, who could in any measure fix it, and, put a stop to those many innovations which mere caprice, daily, strives to introduce? This is a task, I fear, beyond the power of individuals: the destiny of whatever is living, for∣bids its continuing, always, in the same state. However, be the fate of our language, in after-ages, as it may; neither the fear of its alteration, nor, even, its annihilation, shall deter me from publishing the observations I have
<PB N="11" REF="9"/>made. They have neither the rules of grammar, nor the purity of custom, for their object, but the delicate differ∣ence, only, between words, reputed sy∣nonymous; that is to say, the distin∣guishing characteristics of such words, as, resembling each other, in their gene∣ral idea, may, nevertheless, be distin∣guishable, one from another, by some additional one, peculiar to each of them; from whence arises, on many occasions, a necessity of choice, in or∣der to use them with propriety, and, elegance; a thing, as uncommon, as it is beautiful; and, by which taste is enabled to give brilliancy to truth, and, solidity to wit. Avoiding all empty words, it teaches us to reason soundly; averse to the abuse of terms, it makes our diction intelligible; judicious in the choice of words, it gives ease and elegance to our expressions: with the greatest accuracy, it banishes all far∣fetched,
<PB N="12" REF="10"/>vague and spiritless images, with which the trifling and superficial, are content to express themselves; an enemy to confusion, it prevents our rambling in the study of the sciences; in short, I will venture to affirm, that this spirit of justness and distinction, is the true ray that shines; and, in con∣versation, is the lively touch, that dis∣tinguishes the man of delicacy and dis∣cernment, from the vulgar and illite∣rate.</P>
<P>In order to acquire this justness, we must be a little nice upon words, not imagining, that such, as are called syno∣nymous, are really so, exactly uni∣form in their sense, and, resemble each other, as perfectly, as two drops of water from the same spring: for, on a closer examination, we shall see, that this resemblance, does not take in the whole extent and force of significa∣tion; but consists, only, in one prin∣cipal
<PB N="13" REF="11"/>idea, which, they all express; each word differing from the other, by some relative one, which constitutes its proper and particular character. That resemblance, which conveys one gene∣ral idea, makes, then, the words, syno∣nymous; and, the difference, that arises from the particular idea, that accom∣panies the general, makes them, far from being perfectly alike, distinguish∣ing them, as various shades of the same colour.</P>
<P>I will not, absolutely, say, that there are not occasions, on which, so nice a choice may be dispensed with; but, I maintain, that there are still more, where they ought not, or, cannot pass one for another, especially, in studied and elaborate compositions. I will allow it to be a matter of indifference, in choosing a yellow habit, whether we take the hue of the marigold or jonquil; but, would we make an
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>agreeable variety, it is necessary to consult the different shades or tints: how seldom, then, does it happen, that the mind, does not find itself, in simi∣lar circumstances? Very rare indeed! as in that consists, the whole art of writing.</P>
<P>Lest any one, under a false notion, that the richness of a language consists, in the plurality and abundance of words, should explode this system of mine, relative to the dictinction of those, re∣puted synonymous; I must say, that though language is enriched by an abundance of words, yet, that abund∣ance is not merely numeral; which is fit for nothing, but, as it were, to fill the coffers of a miser; but, such as springs from diversity, like that, which is observed, in the various productions of nature. It is the satisfaction of the mind, and, not the tickling of the ear, which is the object of all conversation
<PB N="15" REF="13"/>and writing; for which reason, the quantity of words, is not so much to be esteemed, as their quality. If they vary, only, from each other in their sounds, and, not in their greater or less degrees of energy, comprehension, precision, &amp;c. they, in my opinion, serve more to burthen the memory, than, enrich or facilitate the art of speech. To stand up for a number of words, without any regard to their sense, is, confounding abundance, with superfluity; such a taste, I cannot better compare, than, to that, of the master of a feast, who should think the magnificence of an entertainment, con∣sisted more, in the number of dishes, than, of eatables. Where is the great utility in having many terms to ex∣press one single idea? Is there not more advantage in having proper ex∣pressions for every idea we can form?</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="14"/>It will be in vain for Pleonasm, to alledge in its defence, that by this abundance, we avoid the bad effects of repetition; for, we are deceived with respect to the cause of that effect; it is not the repeating of the same sound, that offends so much, as the repetition of the same idea. If the same word displeases, when used a second time, it is not, because it hath already struck the ear; but, because it hath, before, af∣fected the mind, which grows weary, and, is disgusted, without the graces of novelty. Hence, came the establish∣ment of certain words, we call Pro∣nouns; the repetition of which, custom hath made familiar, having given them no other office, than, simply, to recall the matter in question, without any redundancy of words. For the same reason, what we call Articles, and, Prepositions, are, equally, repeated without disgust; nothing being ex∣pected
<PB N="17" REF="15"/>from them, but, a bare nomina∣tion or indication; for having nothing to determine of themselves, they, al∣ways, appear new, when the subject they indicate, is new. This is an un∣deniable proof that the beauty of words, is more owing to their variety of mean∣ings, than, to their different articula∣tions; and, that 'tis a multiplicity of ideas, that produces, in effect, a multi∣plicity of terms. If any one, yet, doubts this, he has nothing to do, but to ex∣amine them a little closer, and, be a little nicer in his choice; or, without giving himself the trouble of such exa∣mination, let him peruse, only, with attention, the reflections here, laid be∣fore him; for, be the remarks, either just or not, they will, plainly, shew, that, there are no words, so perfectly, synonymous, as, to signify, exactly, the same, upon all occasions; consequent∣ly, they admit of a particular nicety
<PB N="18" REF="16"/>in choice. It is this choice, the fol∣lowing sheets endeavour to determine, by definitions, and, examples, which distinguish, and, disclose the proper cha∣racter of these words; in which, it is hoped, they will, in some measure, succeed.</P>
<P>With respect to the work itself, it may be said, without, either, vanity or affected modesty, that, it is copied from no one; neither was there any one to copy; if it, therefore, merits nothing, from the manner of its execution; it will, at least, from its novelty: to this may be added that of variety; for, almost, every page, contains something differing from, and, independent of, that, which goes before, or, follows af∣ter, although of the same sort. Never book was, at the same time, more uni∣form, and, more diversisied: its perusal needs not be, either, continued or regu∣lar; let the reader open it, where he
<PB N="19" REF="17"/>will, he cannot fail of finding some∣thing, and, that, entire; which will, at least, satisfy his curiosity, if not content his understanding: it will serve as well, to amuse a quarter of an hour, as, em∣ploy a whole day; and, may be taken up, and, laid aside, at any time.</P>

<HEAD>THE AUTHOR's PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER giving the reader, a translation of <HI>Girard's</HI> Preface, it will be unnecessary, to say more, relative to the <HI>usefulness,</HI> of the work, than, that, as a great <HI>inattention</HI> to the beauties of language, is general, almost, in <HI>every</HI> country; a volume or two, of <HI>this</HI> kind, must be, <HI>equally,</HI> acceptable <HI>here,</HI> as in <HI>France;</HI> and, it is hoped, the great esteem, the <HI>Abbé</HI> acquired by
<PB N="21" REF="19"/><HI>his</HI> piece, and, the many editions, <HI>that</HI> has run through, are <HI>sufficient</HI> proofs of its <HI>excellence,</HI> and, will be <HI>some</HI> ex∣cuse, for <HI>this</HI> similar attempt. As much of the <HI>French</HI> treatise, as would agree with the <HI>English</HI> mode of expres∣sion, is translated and adapted to it; and, if such translation, be found, in no respect, <HI>uniform;</HI> it must be attri∣buted to <HI>impossibility.</HI> Should any one imagine, because some words, which are here classed, as <HI>passing</HI> for <HI>synony∣mous,</HI> do not, <HI>immediately,</HI> strike the mind, as <HI>such;</HI> that, labouring at a <HI>distinction,</HI> was unnecessary and use∣less; if he cannot recollect a passage, where he has <HI>seen,</HI> or, call to mind, that he has, at any time, <HI>heard,</HI> them <HI>indiscriminately</HI> used; let him cast his eye, over the <HI>folio</HI> edition, of <HI>Johnson's</HI> dictionary, and he will, <HI>instantly,</HI> dis∣cover that these endeavours, though, <HI>inadequate</HI> to the task, have not been,
<PB N="22" REF="20"/><HI>wholly,</HI> fruitless; and, should the same error be remarked, in the following pages, which the tenor of the work condemns, it is hoped, it will be at∣tributed, to the necessity of varying the expressions, in a treatise of this <HI>particular</HI> cast, in order to make them agreeable to the mind. There are, it must be confessed, <HI>many</HI> more words, that <HI>might</HI> have been taken under con∣sideration; but, on reflection, that a <HI>thorough</HI> reform, even in <HI>these,</HI> at <HI>present,</HI> taken notice of, will go, a <HI>considerable</HI> way, towards the <HI>improve∣ment</HI> of our tongue; the work, cannot <HI>but</HI> be thought of service. <HI>One</HI> mo∣tive that prevented the <HI>extension</HI> of these sheets, was a <HI>fear,</HI> of <HI>frighting</HI> the reader, from attempting to <HI>pass through</HI> them, by laying before him, the <HI>difficulty</HI> and <HI>length</HI> of the way: should they chance to meet with ap∣probation, they may, hereafter, pro∣bably,
<PB N="23" REF="21"/>be <HI>enlarged;</HI> but, on the con∣trary, should they, on <HI>close</HI> exami∣nation, be found too <HI>imperfect,</HI> for public notice: let them, at least, be considered, as the wanton <HI>sallies</HI> of a mind, <HI>greatly</HI> zealous, for the <HI>beauty</HI> of its <HI>native</HI> language.</P>

<HEAD>THE SIGNIFICATION OF WORDS, esteemed SYNONYMOUS, IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE, INVESTIGATED.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>1. To <HI>Abandon, Forsake, Leave,</HI> To <HI>Relinquish, Desert, Quit.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE words <HI>abandon</HI> and <HI>leave</HI> imply involuntary acts; the words <HI>for∣sake, relinquish</HI> and <HI>desert,</HI> those that are voluntary.</P>
<P>To <HI>abandon,</HI> is more applicable to things; <HI>leave,</HI> to persons. He was under a necessity of <HI>abandoning</HI> his possessions, and compelled to <HI>leave</HI> his friends.</P>
<P>To <HI>forsake,</HI> implies leaving in resent∣ment or dislike; to <HI>relinquish,</HI> quitting
<PB N="2" REF="24"/>any claim to; to <HI>desert,</HI> leaving meanly or treacherously.</P>
<P>Being treated with disrespect, we are apt to <HI>forsake</HI> even the person, whose cause we were studious to espouse. Every honest man, finding his plea not backed by justice, would readily <HI>relinquish</HI> his claim, and even make his competitor a recompence adequate to the expence and trouble he had put him to. It is an act of the greatest baseness to <HI>desert</HI> one's friend in time of distress.</P>
<P>To <HI>quit,</HI> implies the breaking off from, and may be either voluntary or involuntary.</P>
<P>When he had acquired by trade sufficient to support himself, for the remainder of his life, he, prudently, <HI>quitted</HI> his business. Being overpowered, by superior strength, he was obliged to <HI>quit</HI> his hold.</P>
<P>We should by no means <HI>abandon,</HI> while we can keep possession; nor <HI>leave,</HI> while we are able to stay; we should not <HI>forsake,</HI> without sufficient reason; nor are we bound to <HI>relinquish,</HI> but when our title is bad; No colour of excuse can be alledged for <HI>deserti∣on;</HI> nor should we ever <HI>quit,</HI> with a view of laying hold again.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="part">
<PB N="3" REF="25"/>
<HEAD>2. To <HI>Abdicate, Renounce, Resign.</HI></HEAD>
<P>To <HI>abdicate</HI> is an involuntary act; <HI>renounce</HI> and <HI>resign</HI> are voluntary.</P>
<P><HI>Abdicate</HI> more particularly relates to a throne; <HI>renounce,</HI> to matters of religion; <HI>resign,</HI> to employments.</P>
<P>King James the second <HI>abdicated</HI> the throne of England, when he could keep possession of it no longer. Many persons, through conviction of mind, have formally <HI>renounced</HI> the errors of the church of Rome. We frequently <HI>resign</HI> our employments, through a desire of retirement.</P>
<P>To <HI>abdicate</HI> a crown, is ever looked upon as disgraceful; to <HI>renounce</HI> a religion, as ho∣nourable, when done through the preva∣lence of truth; and to <HI>resign</HI> and office, as no∣ble, when generously given up in favour of another, and with the approbation of the person we serve.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="part">
<PB N="4" REF="26"/>
<HEAD>3. To <HI>Abale, Diminish,</HI> To <HI>Decrease, Lessen.</HI></HEAD>
<P>These words are nearly synonymous, when they are verbs neuter; they, then, mean to grow less: as verbs active, they are very different. Even as neuters, they will carry some difference in their meaning.</P>
<P>To <HI>abate,</HI> implies a decrease in action; <HI>diminish,</HI> a waste in substance; <HI>decrease,</HI> a decay in moral virtue; <HI>lessen,</HI> a contraction of parts.</P>
<P>Want of spirits, when a man is running, will <HI>abate</HI> his ardour, and, consequently, his pace. Febrifuges, if properly applied, will <HI>abate</HI> a fever. Put sugar into water, and it will <HI>diminish</HI> visibly. An object, seemingly, <HI>diminishes,</HI> in proportion to the distance, from which, we view it.</P>
<P>Through a contempt of religion, men, daily, <HI>decrease</HI> in virtue, a <HI>decrease</HI> in piety, is usually accompanied with false notions of God. Draw the air from a blown-up blad∣der, and it <HI>lessens,</HI> proportionably.</P>
<P>As verbs active; to <HI>abate,</HI> more particu∣larly, implies, to lower in the price of;
<PB N="5" REF="27"/><HI>diminish,</HI> to make less by abscision or des∣truction, either with respect to bulk, value, quality or quantity; <HI>lessen,</HI> to a voluntary act of degradation.</P>
<P>Shop-keepers, generally, ask their cus∣tomers an advanced price for goods, that they may be enabled to <HI>abate,</HI> if desired.</P>
<P>By dividing of substance, we <HI>diminish</HI> its bulk; by breaking a diamond, we <HI>diminish</HI> its value; by mixing water with spirits, we <HI>diminish</HI> the quality; and by taking one yard from ten, we <HI>diminish</HI> the quantity.</P>
<P>A mean action always <HI>lessens</HI> us, in the sight of good men; and whatever false no∣tions vanity may inculcate, we ever seem <HI>less,</HI> when we strive to appear greater.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>4. To <HI>Abhor, Hate,</HI> To <HI>Loath, Detest.</HI></HEAD>
<P>All these words imply aversion, but re∣quire to be differently used, upon different occasions.</P>
<P>To <HI>abhor,</HI> implys an aversion to that, to which, we have a natural antipathy; <HI>hate,</HI> an aversion actuated by revenge: <HI>loath,</HI> is
<PB N="6" REF="28"/>more applicable to food: <HI>detest,</HI> implies a∣version actuated by disapprobation.</P>
<P>We <HI>abhor,</HI> what we cannot endure. We are apt to <HI>hate</HI> the person, who injures us. We <HI>loath</HI> the food, by which we have been surfeited. We <HI>detest</HI> the man, who is guilty of a mean action.</P>
<P>The spendthrift, naturally, <HI>abhors</HI> nig∣gardliness, and the niggard, profligacy. The <HI>hatred</HI> of the revengeful man, is roused, whenever the object of his revenge approa∣ches. The stomach <HI>loaths</HI> the very sight of that meat, by which we have been satiated. Every, thinking, man <HI>detests</HI> the least degree of meanness, more particularly that, which is fordid or base.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>5. <HI>Abject, Low, Mean, Beggarly.</HI></HEAD>
<P>As the words <HI>abject</HI> and <HI>low</HI> are indis∣criminately used, when meant to signify a person's state or condition; so are the words <HI>mean</HI> and <HI>beggarly,</HI> when we would express the disposition: but the impropriety of so doing, is very evident.</P>
<P>By <HI>abject,</HI> is understood that forlorn situ∣ation
<PB N="7" REF="29"/>in life, that a man brings himself in∣to, by ill conduct; by <HI>low,</HI> that, in which Providence has placed him: the first, is voluntary; the latter, involuntary.</P>
<P>Divine Wisdom hath thought proper, for various reasons, to make distinctions be∣tween men, placing some, in a higher sphere, others, in a <HI>lower;</HI> but never was he the cause of any one's <HI>abjectness.</HI> Want of merit or fortune, often, renders a man <HI>low;</HI> but it must be a villainous character, to make him <HI>abject.</HI></P>
<P>With respect to the words <HI>mean</HI> and <HI>beg∣garly,</HI> when meant to express the disposi∣tion, the absurdity of using them, one for the other, is, equally, visible.</P>
<P><HI>Mean,</HI> signifies a man's readiness to per∣form a dirty or illicit action; whereas <HI>beg∣garly,</HI> is, more particularly, expressive of a narrow, groveling spirit.</P>
<P>He who can stoop, to be guilty of a <HI>meanness,</HI> merits the contempt of all who know him. It has, ever, been accounted <HI>beggarly,</HI> to live below the rank of life we are in.</P>
<P>When a man is brought into a state of penury and contempt, by a long course of infamy, we, justly, call him <HI>abject;</HI> if his
<PB N="8" REF="30"/>narrow circumstances are, only, owing to the poverty of his parents, we, then, repute him <HI>low;</HI> when guilty of any thing, beneath the character of an honest man, or a gen∣tleman, we account him <HI>mean;</HI> and when the treasures of the rich, are sullied by the nar∣row notions of the poor, we call it <HI>beggarly.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>6. To <HI>Abolish, Abrogate, Disannul,</HI> To <HI>Repeal, Revoke.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Abolish,</HI> is a term, rather to be used with respect to customs; <HI>abrogate</HI> and <HI>repeal,</HI> with regard to laws; <HI>disannul</HI> and <HI>revoke,</HI> to private contracts.</P>
<P>When old customs have been, by long experience, found to be detrimental, they have, very prudently, been <HI>abolished.</HI> New fashions, <HI>abolish</HI> old ones.</P>
<P>The word <HI>abrogate,</HI> is generally used with respect to ancient laws; <HI>repeal,</HI> to mo∣dern: that is, when we talk of rendering old laws null, we call it <HI>abrogating;</HI> when those lately made, <HI>repealing.</HI></P>
<P>Despotic power has frequently <HI>abrogated</HI> what was instituted by equity. Upon the
<PB N="9" REF="31"/>enaction of a new law, many inconveniences have sometimes appeared, before un∣thought of; this, has occasioned a <HI>repeal.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>abrogation</HI> of a fundamental law, frequently causes the ruin of the sovereign, or of the people; and, sometimes, of both. The legislative power has often found itself obliged to <HI>repeal</HI> an act of parliament one sessions, which passed the last; merely, to appease the clamours of the people.</P>
<P>The difference in meaning, between the words <HI>disannul</HI> and <HI>revoke,</HI> is not very great; yet such, as to admit of a distinction.</P>
<P><HI>Disannul</HI> is applied to a written contract; <HI>revoke</HI> to a verbal.</P>
<P>He, who gives a conditional bond to ano∣ther, has a right to <HI>disannul</HI> it, if the specified conditions are not punctually observed. To <HI>revoke</HI> a promise now-a-days, is no other, than fashionable; whereas, formerly, it was considered, as a breach of friendship.</P>

<HEAD>7. To <HI>Finish, Complete,</HI> To <HI>End, Conclude.</HI></HEAD>
<P>With respect to the three first words, the proper idea of <HI>finishing,</HI> is, the bringing a
<PB N="10" REF="32"/>thing to its last period: the <HI>completion</HI> of any thing, is, the actual arrival of that last period: and the characteristic of <HI>ending,</HI> is cessation or discontinuation.</P>
<P>Lazy people begin many things, without <HI>finishing</HI> any. We ever feel a secret satis∣faction, in the <HI>completion</HI> of a work, we have been long about. May we not ques∣tion the wisdom of those laws, which, instead of <HI>ending</HI> suits, do but serve, to prolong them?</P>
<P>By the word <HI>conclude,</HI> we understand, per∣forming the last act of ratiocination; widely differing from <HI>complete.</HI> We <HI>complete</HI> a piece of mechanism; but <HI>conclude</HI> an oration.</P>
<P>A piece of clockwork is of little value, till <HI>completed.</HI> It is allowed by all Rhetori∣cians, that the greatest ornament of an ha∣rangue, is a well finished <HI>conclusion.</HI></P>
<P>We <HI>finish</HI> what we have begun, by con∣tinuing to work at it. We <HI>complete</HI> a work, by putting the last hand to it. We <HI>end</HI> it, by discontinuation. Thus, we may <HI>finish,</HI> without <HI>ending;</HI> and <HI>end,</HI> without <HI>completing.</HI></P>

<HEAD>8. <HI>On, Upon,</HI></HEAD>
<P>These two words are indiscriminately used, one for another, on all occasions; but, with great impropriety.</P>
<P><HI>On,</HI> rather, signifies by; as, <HI>on</HI> my word; <HI>on</HI> my honour; &amp;c. whereas, <HI>upon,</HI> means up, on the top of; and is applied to mat∣ter; as, <HI>upon</HI> the table; <HI>upon</HI> the chair; <HI>upon</HI> the house; &amp;c.</P>
<P>The absurdity of a contrary diction, is evident from the following change of words: it was his honour, <HI>upon</HI> which, he swore.</P>
<P>Indeed, the word <HI>upon</HI> is used with ele∣gance, even detached from substance, when the sense is figurative; as for ins∣tance, he relied <HI>upon</HI> the promise of his friend; intimating, that, that promise, was the staff, <HI>upon</HI> which, he leaned: but, on other occasions, the impropriety is gross.</P>

<HEAD>9. <HI>Action, Act, Deed.</HI></HEAD>
<P>As custom has applied the word <HI>deed,</HI> chiefly to signify the written evidence of any legal act, it will be necessary, only, to shew the difference, between the words <HI>acti∣on</HI> and <HI>act.</HI></P>
<P>The word <HI>action,</HI> then, is applicable, indif∣ferently, to every thing we do, whether common or extraordinary; but the word <HI>act,</HI> should signify, something done, which is remarkable.</P>
<P>An elegant speaker, will not say, a <HI>virtu∣ous act,</HI> a <HI>good or a vitious act;</HI> but an <HI>act of virtue,</HI> or <HI>of goodness,</HI> or <HI>of iniquity:</HI> where∣as, to say, a <HI>virtuous action,</HI> or <HI>a good</HI> or <HI>vi∣tious action,</HI> is proper and elegant.</P>
<P>'Tis, generally speaking, a good <HI>action</HI> to conceal the faults of our neighbours; and it is the rarest <HI>act</HI> of charity, among mankind.</P>
<P>The sentiments of the heart, are not, so much, to be judged of, from words, as from <HI>actions.</HI> It is an <HI>act,</HI> of great heroism,
<PB N="13" REF="35"/>to pardon our enemies, when we have power, to be revenged on them.</P>
<P>These two words are further distinguish∣able by our considering them, somewhat physically. The word <HI>action,</HI> in this light, relates, more, to the power that acts; and the word <HI>act,</HI> is, more, applicable to the effect itself, produced by that power; this makes the one, properly, the attribute of the other: so, that it may be, justly, said, we should always have a presence of mind, attendant upon our <HI>actions,</HI> to ren∣der, all of them, either <HI>acts</HI> of bounty, or <HI>acts</HI> of justice.</P>

<HEAD>10. To <HI>Enlarge, Increase.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The word <HI>enlarge,</HI> is, properly, used to signify an addition of extent. <HI>Increase,</HI> is critically, applicable, only, to number, height and quantity.</P>
<P>We <HI>enlarge</HI> a town; a field; a garden. We <HI>increase</HI> the inhabitants of a town; our expences; our revenues.</P>
<P>The former word, is, more, suitable to one entire and vast quantity of space; the
<PB N="14" REF="36"/>latter, to any gross and multiplied quantity in general: thus, it is, commonly, said, that we have <HI>enlarged</HI> our house, when we have made it more extensive, by adding buildings to the sides of it: but, we, usually, say, a house is <HI>increased</HI> with an additional story, or with several new rooms.</P>
<P>By <HI>enlarging</HI> our territory, we, generally, <HI>increase</HI> our riches. Princes, certainly, <HI>en∣large</HI> their renown, by widening the bounds of their dominions; and they are apt to think, they, at the same time, <HI>increase</HI> their power: but, in this, they are, sometimes, mistaken; for such an <HI>enlargement,</HI> may chance to produce, only, an, <HI>increase</HI> of cares and troubles, which may end, in their utter ruin.</P>
<P>A king, who labours, more, after acquir∣ing new subjects, than, in governing those he already has, may <HI>enlarge</HI> his fame; but will never <HI>increase</HI> his happiness.</P>

<HEAD>11. <HI>Address, Air, Mien, Behaviour, Manners, Deportment, Carriage.</HI></HEAD>
<P>What is called our <HI>air, mien</HI> and <HI>carriage,</HI> seem to be born with us, and strike at first
<PB N="15" REF="37"/>sight: our <HI>address, manners, behaviour</HI> and <HI>deportment,</HI> are owing to education; and, gradually, disclose themselves, in our inter∣course with the world.</P>
<P><HI>Mien,</HI> rather, relates to our look; <HI>carriage</HI> to our frame; but, the word <HI>air</HI> to both. We, usually, judge of the <HI>mien,</HI> by the face; the <HI>carriage,</HI> by the person; and the <HI>air,</HI> by both.</P>
<P>How sweet is the <HI>mien,</HI> that has good humour in the countenance! A gentle∣man, though in rags, is, easily, discover∣ed, by his graceful <HI>carriage.</HI> An open countenance and majesty of person, give a man, the most engaging <HI>air</HI> imagina∣ble.</P>
<P><HI>Address,</HI> is confined to our words; <HI>de∣portment,</HI> to our actions; <HI>behaviour</HI> arises from both; and the fruit of <HI>behaviour,</HI> is <HI>manners.</HI></P>
<P>Our <HI>address</HI> shall often please, when our <HI>deportment</HI> shall disgust; and VICE VERSA.</P>
<P>When our <HI>address</HI> is engaging, and our <HI>deportment</HI> comformable, 'tis impossible our <HI>behaviour</HI> should be otherwise.</P>
<P>In order, to be well with the world, we should suit our <HI>behaviour,</HI> to our company; which, though in the eye of some persons,
<PB N="16" REF="38"/>has been considered, as deceitful, must, in the end, be looked upon, as the height of good <HI>manners.</HI></P>
<P>An engaging <HI>air,</HI> which is the union of a charming <HI>mien</HI> and graceful <HI>carriage,</HI> is necessary, to make any thing please; but unless accompanied with good <HI>manners,</HI> arising from a genteel <HI>address</HI> and <HI>deport∣ment,</HI> it becomes, perfectly, disgustful.</P>

<P>We <HI>accost</HI> those, with whom, we would speak; but, often, <HI>approach,</HI> without any intention to <HI>address.</HI></P>
<P>The bold, can <HI>accost,</HI> without the least hesitation. We cannot <HI>approach</HI> the great, without some kind of ceremony.</P>
<P>When we have any thing to say to a person, we, naturally, <HI>accost</HI> him: when we would insinuate ourselves into his good graces, we endeavour to <HI>approach</HI> him.</P>
<P>Education teaches us to <HI>accost</HI> the ladies with civility; but, to <HI>approach</HI> them, re∣quires some kind of assurance, seafoned with respect.</P>

<HEAD>13. <HI>Ingenuity, Cleverness, Abilities, Parts,</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Ingenuity,</HI> relates, more, to the invention of things; <HI>cleverness,</HI> to the manner of exe∣cuting them; <HI>ability,</HI> to the actual execution of them; and <HI>parts,</HI> to the discernment. The third, then, puts in use, what the se∣cond dictates, pursuant to the digested plan, of the fourth, invented by the first.</P>
<P>A man may be <HI>ingenious,</HI> and not <HI>clever;</HI> he may be <HI>clever,</HI> without <HI>abilities</HI> to exe∣cute; and he may have great <HI>abilities,</HI> and, yet, not be a man of <HI>parts.</HI></P>
<P>Admitting we are not very <HI>ingenious,</HI> still, if we are accustomed to the management of things, we may be <HI>clever;</HI> but it requires <HI>abilities,</HI> to do with them, as we would; and <HI>parts,</HI> to conduct them.</P>
<P>He, who discovered the powers of refraction and reflection, had he known no∣thing more, would have been <HI>ingenious:</HI> he, who constructed the telescope, was <HI>clever;</HI> the finisher, was a man of <HI>abilities;</HI> and without doubt, the philosopher, he, who applies the instrument to the various pur∣poses of astronomy, must be a man of <HI>parts.</HI></P>

<HEAD>14. To <HI>Add, Augment.</HI></HEAD>
<P>By <HI>adding</HI> one thing to another, we <HI>aug∣ment</HI> the same. By the word <HI>adding,</HI> we understand, the joining of different things together; or, if they are things of the same kind, joining them, in such a manner, as not to confound them, but, that after such junction, each, may be distinguished from the other: whereas, the word <HI>augment,</HI> in∣dicates our making a thing larger or more abundant, by such an addition, as shall cause it, afterwards, to appear one, and the same thing; or, at least, that, when the ad∣dition is made, the whole, together, shall be conceived under one idea; thus, for ex∣ample, we <HI>add</HI> one basket of rubbish, to another, one room to another, but we <HI>augment</HI> the heap, and the house.</P>
<P>There are many, who would not scruple to <HI>augment</HI> their own stock, by fraudu∣lently <HI>adding to</HI> it, that of another.</P>
<P>To <HI>add,</HI> is a verb active only; <HI>augment,</HI> both active and neuter.</P>
<P>Our ambition, <HI>augments</HI> with our for∣tune; and we are no sooner in possession of

<HEAD>15. To <HI>Study, Learn.</HI></HEAD>
<P>To <HI>study,</HI> implies a uniform application, in search of knowledge; to <HI>learn,</HI> that application, with success.</P>
<P>We <HI>study,</HI> to <HI>learn;</HI> and <HI>learn,</HI> by dint of <HI>study.</HI></P>
<P>People of vivacity, <HI>learn</HI> easily; but are heavy at <HI>study.</HI></P>
<P>We can <HI>study</HI> but one thing at a time; but we may <HI>learn</HI> many.</P>
<P>The more we <HI>learn,</HI> the more we know; but, oftentimes, the more we <HI>study,</HI> the less we know.</P>
<P>We have <HI>studied</HI> well, when we have <HI>learned</HI> to doubt.</P>
<P>There are many things we <HI>learn,</HI> without <HI>study;</HI> and other things we <HI>study,</HI> without <HI>learning.</HI></P>
<P>Those are not the wisest, who have <HI>studied</HI> most; but, those who have <HI>learnt</HI> most.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="42"/>We see some persons, <HI>studying</HI> continually, without <HI>learning</HI> any thing; and others, <HI>learning</HI> almost every thing, without the least <HI>study.</HI></P>
<P>The time of our youth, is the time of <HI>study;</HI> but it is, in a more advanced age, when we, truly, can be said, to <HI>learn;</HI> it is then, only, we have capacity to digest, what we have before, laid up in the memory.</P>

<HEAD>16. <HI>Buttress, Support, Prop.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Buttress,</HI> fortifies; it is fixed close, to resist the impulsion of other bodies: the <HI>support,</HI> bears, by being placed beneath a thing, to prevent its falling under a weight: the <HI>prop,</HI> assists, and its general use is, to strengthen.</P>
<P>A wall is frequently made stronger, by <HI>buttresses:</HI> An arch is <HI>supported,</HI> by columns: A house, when in danger of falling, is kept up, by <HI>props.</HI></P>
<P>That, which has received a violent thrust, or is much bulged, stands in need of a <HI>buttress;</HI> that, which is too heavy to
<PB N="21" REF="43"/>carry itself, is in want of <HI>supporters;</HI> and that, which ought to stand upright, and cannot be made to do so of itself, must be <HI>propped.</HI></P>
<P>In a figurative sense, <HI>buttress</HI> relates, more, to defence; <HI>support,</HI> to credit; and <HI>prop,</HI> to friendship.</P>
<P>The true Christian, seeks no <HI>buttress,</HI> a∣gainst the malignity of men, but that of innocence and integrity; he makes work, the most solid <HI>support</HI> of his life; and looks upon implicit obedience to the decree of heaven, as the most steady <HI>prop</HI> of his felicity.</P>

<HEAD>17. <HI>Enough, Sufficient.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The object of both these words, is quan∣tity; but with this difference, that <HI>enough</HI> relates, more, to the quantity, one desires to have, and <HI>sufficient,</HI> to that quantity, one, really, wants to employ.</P>
<P>Thus, the avaritious man never has <HI>enough;</HI> let him accumulate ever so much, he, still, desires more; and the prodigal, never <HI>sufficient;</HI> he, still, wanting to expend more than he has.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="44"/>We say, we have <HI>enough,</HI> when we wish not for more; and we say, we have <HI>sufficient,</HI> when we have, just, what is necessary.</P>
<P>When applied to such things, as are con∣sumable, the word <HI>enough,</HI> seems to denote, a much greater quantity, than the word <HI>suffi∣cient;</HI> for in relation to such things, when we say we have <HI>enough,</HI> it seems, as though we should have too much, had we more: but, what we call <HI>sufficient,</HI> may be added to, without coming near that extreme: for, we may say, of a very small income or revenue, that it is <HI>sufficient;</HI> though, at the same time, we can hardly think it <HI>enough.</HI></P>
<P>The word <HI>enough,</HI> has a more general and comprehensive meaning; the word <HI>sufficient,</HI> a more limited and particular one.</P>
<P>An hour at table, is, certainly, <HI>sufficient,</HI> for our nourishment; but, not <HI>enough,</HI> for some persons pleasure or satisfaction.</P>

<HEAD>18. To <HI>Declare, Affirm, Protest, Aver, Assert,</HI> To <HI>Maintain, Swear, Avouch, Attest.</HI></HEAD>
<P>In the first seven words, we find different degrees of declaration. To <HI>declare,</HI> signi∣fies, to tell any thing simply, but seriously; to <HI>affirm,</HI> means, to say confidently; to <HI>protest,</HI> implies a solemn affirmation; to <HI>aver,</HI> signi∣fies, a positive declaration; to <HI>assert,</HI> that de∣claration, defended; to <HI>maintain,</HI> implies a support of such assertion; to <HI>swear,</HI> is, to ratify it, by an oath.</P>
<P>When we give our opinion, on being seriously asked, we are said, to <HI>declare</HI> it: when we would give that declaration, more force, we <HI>affirm</HI> it: and, to strengthen that affirmation, we <HI>protest</HI> it, solemnly; that is we <HI>affirm</HI> it, by invoking the Deity.</P>
<L>The other words, are, sufficiently, explained above.</L>
<P>If, ever, we wish, to gain credit, in the world, whatever we <HI>declare,</HI> should be back∣ed by truth. True politeness, forbids our
<PB N="24" REF="46"/><HI>affirming</HI> any thing, unless required by the obligations of justice. To make frequent use of <HI>protestations,</HI> betrays a suspicion, that our bare word, is not to be believed. Always to <HI>aver,</HI> hath an appearance of dogmatising; and shews us ignorant of that proper degree of diffidence, which ever accompanies wis∣dom. Some persons are so ready to <HI>assert,</HI> that let the matter be right or wrong, 'tis equally the same. When our opinions are just, and well-grounded, we have an un∣doubted right, to <HI>maintain</HI> them. <HI>Swearing,</HI> was first instituted in courts of judicature, as a conscientious testimony of truth.</P>
<P>The words <HI>avouch,</HI> and <HI>attest,</HI> tho' often usedas synonynous, with the foregoing; have a very different signification. The word, <HI>avouch,</HI> implies, an assertion, in defence of another; <HI>attest,</HI> a bearing, witness to what another has, just before, said.</P>
<P>When the reputation of an honest man has been, undeservedly, hurt, 'tis the part of a friend, to <HI>avouch</HI> his good character.</P>
<P>Too much care to <HI>attest</HI> all that is ad∣vanced, renders our conversation tiresome.</P>
<P>There is another verb, <HI>warrant,</HI> which has some affinity to the word <HI>maintain;</HI> but, as custom has made the use of it vulgar,
<PB N="25" REF="47"/>it is unnecessary to take any further notice of it.</P>

<P>In the state of Switzerland, all men are obliged to learn the use of <HI>arms,</HI> in their youth, that, in cases of extremity, they may be capable of defending themselves against the attacks of their enemies.</P>

<HEAD>20. <HI>Attractions, Allurements, Charms.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Besides the general idea, which makes these three words appear synonymous, it is, likewise, their common fate, scarce ever to be used in the singular number; at least, in those senses, in which, they are here con∣sidered; that is, whenever they are used to signify the power of beauty, of agreeable∣ness, or, of any thing which pleases.</P>
<P>With respect to their different mean∣ings, it appears to me, that <HI>attractions</HI> mean, something natural; <HI>allurements,</HI> some∣what, rather, artificial; and <HI>charms,</HI> some∣what stronger and more uncommon than either.</P>
<P><HI>Attractions,</HI> may be said, to engage us; <HI>allurements,</HI> to entice us; <HI>charms,</HI> to seduce us.</P>
<P>The heart of man can scarce stand against the <HI>attractions</HI> of a pretty woman: It is with difficulty he can defend, himself against the allurements of a <HI>coquette;</HI> but,
<PB N="27" REF="49"/>to resist the <HI>charms</HI> of a sweet-tempered beauty, is impossible.</P>
<P>Ladies, always, owe their <HI>attractions</HI> and their <HI>charms,</HI> to a happy formation of their features and persons; but they, sometimes, procure their <HI>allurements,</HI> at their toilettes.</P>
<P>I know not whether I may fall in with the taste of mankind; but in my opinion, <HI>attractions</HI> rise from those ordinary graces, which nature has bestowed upon the wo∣men with more or less liberality, and which are the common appendages of the sex; <HI>allurements,</HI> from those cultivated graces, which form a faithful mirrour of the natu∣ral, and are studied, merely, with a desire to please; <HI>charms,</HI> from those singular graces, which nature, sometimes, bestows as a most valuable gift, and which are more particu∣lar and personal.</P>
<P>Defects not seen at first, but afterwards observed, lessen <HI>attractions</HI> greatly. <HI>Allure∣ments</HI> vanish, as soon as the artifice appears. <HI>Charms</HI> lose their force, when time and custom hath rendered them familiar.</P>
<P>These words are not in use only, with regard to beauty, and the graces of the sex; but, with respect to every thing that pleases. In this case, <HI>attractions</HI> and <HI>charms,</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="50"/>are applied, only, to such things, as are amiable in themselves; whereas, the word <HI>allurements,</HI> is, sometimes, applied to such things, as are even in themselves odious; but, which we love nevertheless.</P>
<P>Virtue has <HI>attractions,</HI> which the most vicious of men cannot avoid being sensible of. The riches of the world are <HI>allure∣ments,</HI> which never fail to captivate, in spite of their ill tendency. Pleasure has such <HI>charms,</HI> that it is hunted after by every one, as well by the philosopher, as the li∣bertine.</P>
<P>We say, great <HI>attractions;</HI> powerful <HI>al∣lurements;</HI> and, invincible <HI>charms.</HI></P>
<P>Honour <HI>attracts;</HI> fortune <HI>allures;</HI> but, the <HI>charms</HI> of glory, are invincible.</P>

<HEAD>21. <HI>Miserly, Niggardly, Covetous, Avaritious.</HI></HEAD>

<PB N="29" REF="51"/>we understand, that sordid temper, that does things by halves. <HI>Covetous,</HI> implies, an eager craving for the possessions of another. By <HI>avaritious,</HI> we mean, that inordinate thirst of gain, that makes a man grasp at-every thing he sees. Taking the words in these fenses, which are undoubtedly the proper ones, we may be <HI>covetous</HI> and not <HI>avariti∣ous, niggardly</HI> and not <HI>miserly.</HI></P>
<P>He, who never gives any thing away, is justly, called <HI>miserly;</HI> he, who fails to bestow when necessary, or, when he bestows, gives too little, draws on himself the epithet of <HI>niggardly;</HI> he, who longs for the goods of another, is <HI>covetous;</HI> and he, who grasps at wealth by all means whatever, <HI>avaritious.</HI></P>
<P>Of all extraordinary beings, there is no greater one than the <HI>miser,</HI> who punishes himself, and starves in the midst of plenty.</P>

<P>The end of <HI>admonition,</HI> is gentle reproof. <HI>Advice</HI> and <HI>counsel,</HI> are to convey instruction; but with this difference, that <HI>advice,</HI> implies no superiority with respect either to rank or parts, in the person who gives it; where∣as, <HI>counsel,</HI> generally, carries with it one, if not both.</P>

<P>In order to <HI>have</HI> a thing, it is not neces∣sary to have the power of disposal of it, or to have it actually in our hands; it is suf∣ficient that it belongs to us: but to <HI>possess</HI> it, it must be in our hands, and, we have the liberty of disposing of it, whenever we think proper.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="55"/>Thus, we <HI>have,</HI> an estate, notwithstand∣ing it is mortgaged for the benefit of our creditors; but, as to riches, we <HI>possess,</HI> them.</P>

<P><PB N="34" REF="56"/>Thus, the <HI>fight,</HI> between the Carthaginians and the Romans, and that, at Pharsalia, be∣tween Caesar and Pompey, were <HI>battles:</HI> but those, in which the Horatii and the Curatii, decided the fate of Rome, were <HI>combats.</HI></P>

<P>It is the fate of these words, when ap∣plied to the female sex, to be used indis∣criminately one for the other, and yet, at the same time, no three words can be more different.</P>
<P>By a <HI>handsome</HI> woman, we understand one, that is graceful and well shaped, with a regu∣lar disposition of features: by a <HI>pretty,</HI> we mean one, that is delicately made, and whose features are so formed, as to please: by a <HI>beautiful,</HI> a union of both.</P>
<P>A lady may be <HI>handsome</HI> and not <HI>pretty, pretty</HI> and not <HI>handsome;</HI> but, to be <HI>beautiful,</HI> she must be both <HI>pretty</HI> and <HI>handsome.</HI></P>

<P>The ladies, in romances, are described, as, either <HI>beautiful</HI> or <HI>handsome;</HI> the shep∣herdesses, by the poets, are represented as <HI>pretty;</HI> so, in other things, we say, a <HI>beau∣tiful</HI> palace; a <HI>handsome</HI> house; a <HI>pretty</HI> cot∣tage.</P>
<P>A <HI>beautiful</HI> woman, is an object of curio∣sity; a <HI>handsome</HI> woman, of admiration; and a <HI>pretty</HI> one, of love.</P>
<P>When applied to other things, <HI>beautiful,</HI> relates to something more serious and en∣gaging; <HI>pretty,</HI> to somewhat more gay and diverting: this is the reason why we say a <HI>beautiful</HI> tragedy; but, a <HI>pretty</HI> comedy.</P>

<P><HI>Benignity,</HI> is a sort of kind condescen∣tion, and an attribute of princes only. <HI>Be∣nevolence,</HI> a wishing well to mankind, and seems relative to those, who have, more parti∣cularly, the power of doing good. <HI>Kindness,</HI> is the same disposition among equals. <HI>Ten∣derness,</HI> is a susceptibility of impression, and more applicable, to persons nearly connect∣ed. <HI>Humanity,</HI> denotes a fellow feeling, for the distresses, even, of a stranger.</P>
<P><HI>Benegnity, benevolence,</HI> and <HI>kindness,</HI> spring from the will; <HI>tenderness,</HI> and <HI>humanity,</HI> from the heart.</P>
<P>The <HI>benignity</HI> of a prince, makes him universally beloved by his subjects.</P>
<P><HI>Benevolence,</HI> is a shining character, and is more conspicuous, for the charitable actions it produces.</P>

<P>The great <HI>tenderness</HI> of animals, to their young, is a standing reproof to the many unfeeling mothers.</P>

<P><HI>Indigence,</HI> is a degree lower; we there want the necessaries; and is opposed to su∣perfluity.</P>
<P><HI>Want,</HI> seems rather to arrive by accident, implies, a scarcity of provisions, rather than a lack of money, and is opposed to abundance.</P>
<P><HI>Need</HI> and <HI>necessity</HI> relate less to the situa∣tion of life, than the other three words, but more to the relief we expect, or the remedy we seek; with this difference be∣tween the two, that <HI>need,</HI> seems less pressing than <HI>necessity.</HI></P>
<P>Merit, or a fortunate circumstance, in life, frequently extricates us from a state of <HI>poverty,</HI> in which we were born; and in which, prodigality often plunges the rich.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="61"/>Diligence is the best remedy against <HI>in∣digence,</HI> which is, generally, the just pu∣nishment of idleness.</P>

<P>The means of obtaining relief, in ex∣treme <HI>necessity,</HI> is to implore the succour of the truly charitable.</P>
<P>A state of <HI>poverty,</HI> is most conducive to the health of the soul; we being there, out of the way of temptations.</P>

<P>What we call <HI>good-fortune,</HI> is the effect of chance; it comes unexpected. <HI>Prosperity,</HI> is the success of conduct; and comes by degrees.</P>
<P>Fools have, sometimes, <HI>good fortune:</HI> wise men do not, always, <HI>prosper.</HI></P>
<P>The Capital, that was saved by the cack∣ling of geese, and not by the vigilance of the centinels, is a piece of history, more proper, to shew the <HI>good-fortune,</HI> of the Ro∣mans, than their military government on that occasion; though, on all others, their wise conduct, has contributed as much to their <HI>prosperity,</HI> as the valour of their soldiers.</P>

<HEAD>30. <HI>Good-nature, Good-humour.</HI></HEAD>
<P>These terms, though very expressive of their respective meanings, are too often
<PB N="41" REF="63"/>for want of proper discernment, con∣founded.</P>
<P>We may be <HI>good-humoured,</HI> and not <HI>good∣natured; good-natured,</HI> and yet not, always, <HI>good-humoured.</HI></P>
<P>To make this properly appear, it is ne∣cessary to give a full definition of each.</P>
<P>By <HI>good-nature,</HI> is meant, that disposition, which partakes the felicity of all mankind; that promotes the satisfaction of every in∣dividual, within the reach of its ability; that relieves the distressed, comforts the afflicted, diffuses blessings, and communi∣cates happiness, as far as its sphere of ac∣tion can extend; whereas, <HI>good-humour</HI> is nothing more, than a chearful, pleasing de∣portment, arising, either from a natural gaiety of mind, or, an affectation of popu∣larity, joined to an affability of behaviour, which is the result of good-breeding, and a compliance with the taste of every com∣pany.—This kind of <HI>good-humour,</HI> is by far, the most striking quality; 'tis frequently mistaken for, and complimented with, the superior name of real <HI>good-nature.</HI> A man, by this specious appearance, has often ac∣quired that appellation, who, in all the ac∣tions of his private life, has been a morose,
<PB N="42" REF="64"/>cruel, revengeful, sullen, haughty tyrant. On the contrary, a man of a true benevo∣lent disposition, and formed, to promote the happiness of all around him, may sometimes, perhaps, from an ill habit of body, an accidental vexation, or a com∣mendable openness of heart, above the meanness of disguise, be guilty of little sal∣lies of peevishness or <HI>ill-humour,</HI> that may carry the appearance of, and be, unjustly, thought to proceed from, <HI>ill-nature,</HI> by per∣sons who are not acquainted with his true character; and, who take them for synony∣mous terms, tho', in reality, they have not the least analogy to each other.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>31. <HI>Happiness, Felicity, Bliss.</HI></HEAD>
<P>These three words denote, equally, an ad∣vantageous state, and agreeable situation; but that of <HI>happiness,</HI> marks, properly, the state of fortune, capable of dispensing plea∣sures, and placing them within our reach; that of <HI>felicity,</HI> expresses, particularly, the state of
<PB N="43" REF="65"/>the heart; disposed to ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e pleasure, which it finds, in whatsoever it possesses; that of <HI>bliss,</HI> which conveys a mys<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> idea, paints a state of imagination, which we anticipate, as it were, from a thorough conviction that we shall inherit it hereafter.</P>
<P>Our <HI>happiness</HI> glares in the eyes of the world, and exposes us, often, to envy. Our <HI>felicity</HI> is known only to ourselves, and gives us continual satisfaction. The idea of <HI>bliss,</HI> extends itself beyond a life temporal.</P>
<P>We are sometimes in a state of <HI>happiness,</HI> without being in a state of <HI>felicity. Happi∣ness</HI> consists in the possession of wealth, ho∣nours, friends and health; but 'tis the satisfaction of the mind, and the enjoyment of those things, that constitutes <HI>felicity.</HI> As to <HI>bliss,</HI> it is the portion of the godly, and depends in each religion, on the per∣suasion of the mind.</P>
<P>Satisfaction without, forms the <HI>happiness</HI> of man; satisfaction within, his felicity: <HI>bliss</HI> must be asked of God. The first, is within the reach of riches, the second, of wisdom, but, the third, is reserved for those, whom the scripture calls, the poor in spirit.</P>

<P>We approach, or, get farther from the <HI>confines;</HI> we contract, or, extend the <HI>limits;</HI> we advance, or, remove the <HI>bounds.</HI></P>
<P>By <HI>confines,</HI> we rather understand, the edge or border: the <HI>confines</HI> of a country, not surrounded by the sea, are generally distin∣guished by rivers or hills.</P>
<P>He, who continually exceeds the <HI>limits,</HI> which temperance hath set, will soon find himself, on the <HI>confines</HI> of the grave.</P>

<P>Each, of these words, signifies, the least of those parts which constitutes a thing; but with this difference, that <HI>extremity,</HI> supposes a situation and an arrangement, intimating the greatest distance; whereas, <HI>end,</HI> supposes a length only, and denotes, that place where the length ceases.</P>

<P>A light <HI>burthen,</HI> is no inelegant expressi∣on; but, a light <HI>load,</HI> certainly is.</P>

<P>The word <HI>charm,</HI> carries an idea of force, which puts a stop to ordinary effects and natural causes.

<P>Antiquated tales, say there is a <HI>charm</HI> to destroy the effect of arms, and make them

<P>We <HI>chastise,</HI> him, who has committed a fault, to prevent his doing the same again: we <HI>punish,</HI> the person guilty of a crime, by way of expiation, and, as an example to others. To <HI>correct,</HI> signifies, to amend, by means of <HI>chastisement;</HI> to <HI>discipline,</HI> means, to regulate and instruct.</P>
<P>We <HI>chastise</HI> a child, in order to <HI>correct</HI> his manners: officers are, frequently, oblig∣ed to <HI>punish</HI> a soldier with death, to keep up good <HI>discipline</HI> in the regiment.</P>
<P>It is necessary, for good <HI>correction,</HI> that the <HI>chastisement,</HI> be not the effect of anger: justice demands, that the <HI>punishment,</HI> be ri∣gorous, when the crime, is enormous; other∣wise, there can be no good <HI>discipline</HI> in the state.</P>
<P>God, like a tender father, <HI>chastises</HI> us in this life, that we may not be <HI>punished</HI> in the life to come.</P>
<P>As the words <HI>chastise,</HI> and, <HI>punish,</HI> are thought to have the nearest affinity to each
<PB N="50" REF="72"/>other; it may not be unnecessary, to shew a, yet further, difference between them.</P>
<P><HI>Chastise,</HI> then, carries, always, with it an idea of subordination; denoting, an autho∣rity or superiority in him, who <HI>chastises,</HI> over the person, <HI>chastised;</HI> but the word, <HI>punishment,</HI> carries no such idea, in its signi∣fication; for we are sometimes <HI>punished,</HI> by our equals, by ourselves, by our inferiors, by the mere event of things, or, by the effects of the fault, we have committed.</P>

<P>A proper attention to <HI>prudence,</HI> would make us so <HI>discreet,</HI> as to be <HI>careful,</HI> in every thing we do; and cause us to act, with the greatest <HI>caution.</HI></P>
<P>A hasty conduct, can never be called <HI>prudent:</HI> want of attention, in affairs of moment, is the greatest height of <HI>indiscre∣tion;</HI> for without that necessary qualifica∣tion, 'tis impossible any thing we do, can be attended with success: He who expects to do any thing well, must act with <HI>care;</HI> and he, who is desirous of avoiding diffi∣culties, with <HI>caution.</HI></P>

<P>A proper attention, to the manner of act∣ing, and, conducting ourselves, in our com∣merce with the world, with respect to others; contributing rather to their satis∣faction, than our own, is the common and general idea, which these three words pre∣sent, at first sight: notwithstanding which, it appears to me, that their application should be different.</P>
<P><HI>Circumspection,</HI> principally, takes place in discourse; it prevents our letting any thing escape us, that may do hurt, or give offence; and, is the effect of prudence, which risks nothing. <HI>Consideration,</HI> is more per∣sonal, and relates, particularly, to our man∣ner of treating other people, making a proper distinction, as different opportuni∣ties may offer; and, is the consequence of esteem and duty. <HI>Regard,</HI> relates more to the state, or, situation of persons; being, particularly, careful to omit nothing, which
<PB N="53" REF="75"/>good sense and politeness requires; and, is the fruit of a good education.</P>
<P>To be well with the world, requires <HI>cir∣cumspection,</HI> when we are speaking before those, with whom, we are not acquainted; <HI>consideration,</HI> for people of rank and qua∣lity; and, <HI>regard,</HI> towards those, with whom, we are interested.</P>

<P>The first three of these words, are oftner understood in a good sense, than the other.</P>
<P><HI>Cunning,</HI> is employed in using means; <HI>finesse,</HI> insinuates insensibly, and, must be accompanied by penetration; <HI>device,</HI> sur∣prises, and, gives satisfaction; <HI>artifice,</HI> gene∣rally, makes use of studied dissimulation; a <HI>trick,</HI> is, commonly, looked on as a fraud, and a <HI>stratagem,</HI> is oftener illicit, than otherwise.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="77"/>Without some degree of <HI>cunning,</HI> it will be impossible to deal with, or, guard against, the generality of mankind.</P>
<P><HI>Finesse,</HI> is so essential to the courtier, that, without it, he is seen through presently.</P>

<P>A <HI>moment,</HI> is not long; but, an <HI>instant,</HI> is still shorter. The word <HI>moment,</HI> has a sig∣nification, more extended; it is taken some∣times, for time, in general; and, is used in
<PB N="56" REF="78"/>a figurative sense: that, of <HI>instant,</HI> is more contracted; it marks the shortest duration or time, and, is never used, but in the lite∣ral sense.</P>
<P>All depends upon knowing the favour∣able <HI>moment;</HI> sometimes, an <HI>instant,</HI> too soon, or, too late, is all, that makes the dif∣ference between success and misfortune.</P>
<P>Let us banish thought, as much as in our power, still, now and then, a reflective moment will intrude. The face of things, which we have thought established, have been, frequently, changed in an <HI>instant.</HI></P>
<P>Every <HI>moment</HI> is dear to one, who knows the value of time. Every <HI>instant</HI> of our life, is a step nearer the grave.</P>

<HEAD>42. <HI>Customs, Manners, Fashions.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Customs,</HI> relate to the general practice of the people; <HI>manners,</HI> to their way of life; and, <HI>fashions,</HI> to their dress.</P>
<P>There cannot be a more ridiculous <HI>custom,</HI> than that, of persons compliment∣ing
<PB N="57" REF="79"/>each other, in time of divine service; it being supposed, they have there, more material things to engross their attention.</P>
<P>An increase, or, decrease of luxury, has been found to have, more or less, influence on the <HI>manners</HI> of the people.</P>
<P>It has been observed, that there is a con∣tinual round of <HI>fashions;</HI> when the new are worn out, they, then, have recourse to the old, and those old ones, become new.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="43" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>43. To <HI>Be, Exist, Subsist.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Be,</HI> agrees with all sorts of subjects, sub∣stances or modes; with all manner of be∣ings, real or ideal: <HI>Exist,</HI> is used, only, with respect to substances, and those, real: <HI>Subsist,</HI> is applied, equally, to substances or modes, but with reference to the duration of their being, which is not expressed by the other two words.</P>
<P>We say, of qualities, forms, actions, mo∣tions, and, of all their different relations, that, they <HI>are;</HI> we say, of matter, spirit,
<PB N="58" REF="80"/>bodies, and, all real beings, that, they <HI>exist:</HI> We say, of states, works, affairs, laws, and, all establishments, which are neither destroyed or changed, that, they <HI>subsist.</HI></P>
<P>The verb, <HI>be,</HI> is commonly, used to mark the event of any modification or quality, in the subject: that, of <HI>exist,</HI> is in use, only, to express the end of simple existence: and we employ <HI>subsist,</HI> to point out the dura∣tion of that existence or modification. Thus, we say, that man <HI>is</HI> inconstant; that the phoenix <HI>exists</HI> not; that all human establishments <HI>subsist,</HI> but for a time.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="44" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>44. <HI>Famous, Illustrious, Celebrated, Renowned.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Each of these qualities, distinguishes the reputation; but that, which the word <HI>fa∣mous,</HI> expresses, means, no more than a simple distinction of one country or age, above another, let that distinction be taken either in good part or bad. That, which the word, <HI>illustrious</HI> expresses, is found∣ed upon a merit, supported by dignity and glory; which makes the object, not only
<PB N="59" REF="81"/>known, but admired, and ranked among the great. That, which we understand, by the word, <HI>celebrated,</HI> expresses, a superior degree of talents, with respect either to abilities or knowledge; tho' it raises not the object, to an equal degree of grandeur, with the <HI>illustrious,</HI> it is, nevertheless, ho∣nourable. That, which the word, <HI>renown∣ed,</HI> denotes, is founded, only, upon fashion or public taste; which, without casting much honour on the subject, draws it sim∣ply from oblivion, and makes its name known to the world.</P>
<P>The maid of Orleans, cried down by the English, but, esteemed by the French, was, equally, <HI>famous,</HI> in both nations. Princes shine, during their life; but, they are only <HI>illustrious,</HI> in future ages, by the monu∣ments of grandeur, wisdom and greatness, which they leave behind them. There are <HI>celebrated</HI> authors, whose works, we cannot find fault with; and, those, which we can∣not even commend; without risking our own reputation. A man's fortune is half made, when once he becomes <HI>renowned</HI> in his profession.</P>
<P><HI>Famous, celebrated,</HI> and, <HI>renowned,</HI> are equally, applicable to persons or things;
<PB N="60" REF="82"/>but <HI>illustrious,</HI> to persons only; at least, when we would be nice in our choice of words.</P>
<P>Erostratus, among the Greeks, set sire to the temple of Diana, to make himself <HI>famous:</HI> he was rendered more so, by an order of the state, that his name should never after be mentioned, on pain of pu∣nishment. The greatest part of our libels, are of the same kind; they raise a dust and become <HI>famous,</HI> by being burnt by the hangman. The Duke of Marlborough be∣came <HI>illustrious,</HI> by the many victories he obtained; his glorious actions are <HI>cele∣brated</HI> in history; so, are the many court∣intrigues of the Dutchess. The Gobelins were so <HI>renowned,</HI> that their names live in the place, were they worked, and, in those works, in which, others imitate them. It is a question, whether the Phalernian wine was more <HI>renowned,</HI> than those are, of Champaigne and Burgundy.</P>

<PB N="61" REF="83"/>
<HEAD>45. <HI>Excuse, Pardon, Forgiveness.</HI></HEAD>
<P>We make <HI>excuse,</HI> for an apparent fault, or, slight offence: we ask <HI>pardon,</HI> for a real fault, or, when the offence is greater. We implore <HI>forgiveness</HI> of our sins. The first, is an apology, in order to justify ourselves, and, is founded on politeness; the second, is the mark of a good disposition, and, is done, in hopes of extenuation; the last, to avert the vengeance, and, declares repentance.</P>
<P>The good mind, <HI>excuses,</HI> easily. The good heart, <HI>pardons,</HI> readily. God delights more in <HI>forgiveness,</HI> than in <HI>revenge.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Excuse,</HI> is more used, when we address ourselves to equals; <HI>pardon,</HI> to superiors; and, <HI>forgiveness,</HI> to heaven.</P>
<P>Good manners demand an <HI>excuse</HI> for that, which turns out wrong, let the intention be never so good. It can never be a degra∣dation, to ask pardon of that person, whom we have offended; besides, the superior rank of some persons, makes it an absolute duty in the offender. How great is the
<PB N="62" REF="84"/>presumption of that wretch, who fancies himself not in need of the <HI>forgiveness</HI> of the Almighty!</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="46" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>46. <HI>Duty, Obligation.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Duty,</HI> means, something conscientious, and, springs from a law; <HI>obligation,</HI> some∣thing absolute in practice, and, springs from custom.</P>
<P>We are said, to fail, in our <HI>duty;</HI> and, to dispense, with an <HI>obligation.</HI></P>
<P>It is the <HI>duty</HI> of a clergyman, to carry himself modestly; and he is <HI>obliged,</HI> to wear dark coloured cloaths.</P>
<P>Policy finds less disadvantage, in neg∣lecting her <HI>duty,</HI> than in forgetting the least of her <HI>obligations.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="47" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>47. To <HI>Live, Dwell.</HI></HEAD>
<P>These two words are synonymous, in that sense, in which they signify residence;
<PB N="63" REF="85"/>but <HI>live,</HI> relates to the particular place where, we inhabit; <HI>dwell,</HI> to the building, in which, we reside.</P>
<P>We <HI>live,</HI> in London; in Middlesex; in the country; we <HI>dwell,</HI> in a large house; a cottage; or, a furnished lodging.</P>
<P>When persons of distinction, <HI>live</HI> in Lon∣don; they <HI>dwell</HI> in hovels, comparatively speaking, with their houses in the country.</P>
<P>We say, with great propriety, I <HI>live,</HI> all the summer, in the country; and, have one of the prettiest <HI>dwellings</HI> imaginable.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="48" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>48. To <HI>Stay, Remain.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The common idea of these two words, is a cessation of progression; and their difference consists in this; that, to <HI>stay,</HI> seems to have less duration, than to <HI>remain.</HI></P>
<P>A good servant, when sent on a message, <HI>stays,</HI> as short a time as possible.</P>
<P>When we have given offence, we should endeavour to make such an attonement, that the offended party may not <HI>remain</HI> dissatisfied.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="86"/>The duration of time, expressed by the word, <HI>stay,</HI> seems less determinate, than that, by the word, <HI>remain.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, we say, he <HI>remained</HI> at his country house a month; he <HI>stay'd</HI> longer, than we expected.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="49" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>49. <HI>Event, Incident.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Event,</HI> is a word, most agreeable to states and governments; <HI>incident,</HI> to casualties in private life.</P>
<P>The revolutions of the state, are <HI>events,</HI> that determine the happiness of the people.</P>
<P>Our life is full of <HI>incidents,</HI> which, the eye of prudence cannot foresee.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="50" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>50. To <HI>Awake, Awaken.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The first, of these words, is, more fre∣quently, used in a literal sense; the last, in a figurative.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="87"/>The least noise <HI>awakes</HI> those, who sleep indifferently. It requires but little, to <HI>awaken</HI> a passion, which is not, entirely, rooted out from the heart.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="51" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>50. <HI>Heavy, Weighty.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The word <HI>heavy,</HI> is more applicable to that, which loads the body; <HI>weighty,</HI> to that, which burdens the mind. It requires strength, to carry the one; parts, to sup∣port the other.</P>
<P>A weak man finds that, <HI>heavy,</HI> which, the strong find, light. The administration of state affairs, is too <HI>weighty</HI> a concern, for one person to undertake.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="52" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>51. To <HI>Conquer, Subdue, Overcome.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Each of these words, implies, resistance; but, that of <HI>conquer,</HI> refers to victory over ene∣mies;
<PB N="66" REF="88"/>and is, generally, used in the literal sense: that of <HI>subdue,</HI> is more applicable to our passions; being, oftener, used in a fi∣gurative; and means, a bringing under subjection: that of <HI>overcome,</HI> supposes ef∣forts, against any obstacle that opposes; meaning, rather, to surmount.</P>
<P>We have <HI>conquered</HI> our enemies, when we have beat them, in such a manner, as to put it out of their power, to do us any further hurt. We may be said, to have <HI>subdued</HI> our lusts, when we are able to withstand every temptation. We <HI>over∣come</HI> our adversaries, when we obtain our end, in spite of every opposition.</P>
<P>It requires courage and valour, to <HI>con∣quer;</HI> endeavour and resolution, to <HI>subdue;</HI> patience and perseverance, to <HI>overcome.</HI></P>
<P>Alexander gloried more in his <HI>conquests,</HI> than in any other thing upon earth. Of all passions, avarice is the most difficult to <HI>sub∣due;</HI> as neither age, or, weakness of consti∣tution, is able to rebate its edge. We should strive to <HI>overcome</HI> evil, with good.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="53" TYPE="part">
<PB N="67" REF="89"/>
<HEAD>53. <HI>To no purpose, Ineffectually, In vain.</HI></HEAD>
<P>We work, <HI>to no purpose,</HI> when we meet not with the reward, we expected to re∣ceive; <HI>Ineffectually,</HI> when that, which we have done, answers not the end proposed; <HI>In vain,</HI> when our work, is of no kind of use whatever.</P>
<P>I shall have worked <HI>to no purpose,</HI> if these sheets meet not with the approbation of the public; <HI>Ineffectually,</HI> if, after all my trouble, I have not been able to shew the true difference between words, reputed sy∣nonymous; and, <HI>in vain,</HI> if the book is found to be, neither amusing or instructive.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="54" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>54. <HI>Wave, Surge, Billow.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Waves,</HI> are the natural effect of the flui∣dity of a running water; they are as ap∣plicable to rivers, as the sea; and, leave
<PB N="68" REF="90"/>the idea of a calm. <HI>Surges,</HI> are appli∣ed, properly, to the sea, only; imply swol'n waves, and, mark a small degree of agitation. <HI>Billows,</HI> proceed from a more violent motion, consequently, denote a greater agitation; they break into white foam, and, are attended with no little roar.</P>
<P>We cut through the <HI>waves;</HI> are lift∣ed, by the <HI>surges;</HI> tossed and dashed, by the <HI>billows.</HI></P>
<P>The life of some men, may be, aptly, compared to the sharp-keeled vessel, cutting through the <HI>waves,</HI> leaving no noise or track behind it: while that of others, may be represented, as tossed up and down, on the wind-swoln <HI>surges</HI> of a boisterous fortune; or, dashed in pieces, by the foaming <HI>billows</HI> of ad∣versity.</P>

<HEAD>55. <HI>Uproar, Tumult, Riot.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Uproar,</HI> conveys an idea of some great noise; <HI>tumult,</HI> and, <HI>riot,</HI> of some great dis∣order.</P>
<P>The diference between the words <HI>tu∣mult,</HI> and, <HI>riot,</HI> is, that <HI>tumult,</HI> implies, the rising of many people; <HI>riot,</HI> the disturbance of a few; whereas, an <HI>up∣roar,</HI> may be occasioned, by one single person.</P>
<P><HI>Tumults,</HI> and, <HI>riots</HI> are, always, attend∣ed with such <HI>uproars,</HI> as give umbrage to a peaceable neighbourhood.</P>
<P>Houses of debauchery, are subject to <HI>riots:</HI> a <HI>tumult</HI> often happens, in ill-policed cities.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="56" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>56. <HI>Inclination, Propension, Bias.</HI></HEAD>
<P>These three words rise gradually; <HI>inclination,</HI> implying some thing less strong,
<PB N="70" REF="92"/>than <HI>propension; propension,</HI> than <HI>bias:</HI> the first, leads us to an object; the se∣cond, draws us, the third, drags us.</P>
<P><HI>Inclination,</HI> is, greatly, owing to education; <HI>propension,</HI> to custom; <HI>bias,</HI> to constitu∣tion.</P>
<P>Choice of company, is essential to the education of youth, because, at that age, they imbibe easily the <HI>inclinations</HI> of those, whose company they keep. It is a dan∣gerous thing, to give a loose to any one vice, as frequent commission, is apt to create strong <HI>propension.</HI> Persons of warm constitutions, have a natural <HI>bias</HI> to venery.</P>
<P><HI>Inclination,</HI> is, generally, applied to good objects; <HI>propension,</HI> to bad. Thus, we say, the charitable man is ever <HI>inclined</HI> to assist his neighbour. So deprayed is hu∣man nature, that we have, always, a <HI>pro∣pension</HI> to vice.</P>
<P>Of two persons to be served, a fo∣reigner, and, a countryman; we are, ge∣nerally, <HI>biassed</HI> in favour of the last.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="57" TYPE="part">
<PB N="71" REF="93"/>
<HEAD>57. <HI>Should, Ought, Is necessary.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The first of these expressions, implys, more precisely, an obligation of complai∣sance, custom, or, personal interest: thus, we <HI>should</HI> not offend the company, we are in; we <HI>should</HI> follow the fashion; we <HI>should</HI> know a man, before we trust him. The second, denotes, more particularly, an obli∣gation of reason and good sense; thus, we <HI>ought</HI> in every thing, to give up to those, who know better than ourselves; we <HI>ought</HI> to serve them, who have served us. The third, is more used to ex∣press an essential and indispensable obliga∣tion; thus, it <HI>is necessary,</HI> to love God, in order to be saved: It <HI>is necessary,</HI> to be com∣plaisant, to please.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="58" TYPE="part">
<PB N="72" REF="94"/>
<HEAD>58. <HI>Furthermore, Moreover, Besides.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Furthermore,</HI> is, properly, used, when there is need only to add one more reason, to those, before-mentioned; its intent, is to multiply, and, it has no relation, but to number. <HI>Moreover,</HI> is in its right place, when used, to add a reason of a different kind, to those, that went before; its chief office is, to add, with a particular respect, to diversity. <HI>Besides,</HI> is used with pro∣priety, when we would strengthen by a new reason, the force of those, that were sufficient of themselves, its principal office is, to enhance by abundance.</P>
<P>For a state to support itself, those, who govern, should be moderate; those who ought to obey, governable; <HI>furthermore,</HI> the laws should be judicious. There will always be war among men, because, they are naturally ambitious, and are governed by interest; <HI>moreover,</HI> zeal for religion, makes them rigid. Holy Scripture teaches us the unity of the Godhead, and, reason
<PB N="73" REF="95"/>points it out to us: <HI>besides,</HI> all nature makes us perceive it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="59" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>59. To <HI>Manifest, Publish, Proclaim.</HI></HEAD>
<P>These three words, imply, open decla∣ration; but that of <HI>manifest,</HI> seems to con∣vey, a proof of what is made known; meaning, to shew incontestably: <HI>Publish,</HI> de∣notes, only, a simple declaration, but ge∣neral: to <HI>proclaim,</HI> is, to make known by a formal and legal publication.</P>
<P>When once a man has lost his name, let him <HI>manifest</HI> his good character, as much as possible, he will find it difficult, to recover the good opinion of mankind, for prejudice is blind, even, to the most visible truths. He who <HI>publishes</HI> to the world, the failings of another, betrays in himself, a want of humanity, and, is sure to meet with the contempt of every think∣ing man. A famous Sultan of Egypt left to posterity, a most remarkable testimony of the vanity of earthly grandeur; for, on his
<PB N="74" REF="96"/>death-bed, he commanded, that his wind∣ing sheet should be carried at the end of a lance, by a herald; who was to <HI>proclaim,</HI> here is all, that this great prince will carry out of the world with him, of his wealth, dignity, and dominion, that he enjoyed upon earth.</P>
<P><HI>Manifestos</HI> of a state, are, usually, <HI>publish∣ed,</HI> by formal <HI>proclamation.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="60" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>60. To <HI>Tell, Disclose, Reveal,</HI> To <HI>Divulge, Discover.</HI></HEAD>
<P>To make known that which is un∣known, is the common signification of those words: but, to <HI>tell,</HI> is to declare things purposely, with a design to inform those, we would not have remain ignorant. To <HI>disclose,</HI> is to shew, either by design or inadvertency, that which was before con∣cealed. To <HI>reveal,</HI> is to lay open a secret: to <HI>divulge,</HI> is to do the same abroad. To <HI>dis∣cover,</HI> is the declaring a person to have done a thing, which he would not have been thought the author of.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="97"/>So great an itch, have some persons for prattling, that they <HI>tell</HI> every individual thing they hear. Confidents too often <HI>dis∣close</HI> the intrigues, they are entrusted with. Confessors <HI>reveal,</HI> sometimes, by their im∣prudence, the confession of penitents. The <HI>divulging</HI> of a secret, has, often, done more harm, than any other one thing whatever; as it is impossible to smother, what once has been blazed abroad. If we would not be <HI>discovered,</HI> we should be careful to have no witness of our actions.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="61" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>61. <HI>Equivocation, Ambiguity, Double-entendre.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Equivocation,</HI> has two senses; the one, natural, in which, we would have what we say understood, and, in which, the hearer does, absolutely, understand us; the other, perverted, understood only, by the person speaking. <HI>Ambiguity,</HI> has one general sense, susceptible of different interpretations; it, always, creates a difficulty in getting at the true sense of the author, and, some∣times,
<PB N="76" REF="98"/>an impossibility. The <HI>double-enten∣dre,</HI> a french word lately naturalized, has two natural and apt significations, one of which presents itself to the common under∣standing of all the world; and, by the other is made, a fine allusion, understood, but by certain persons.</P>
<P>These three ways of speaking, are, upon occasion, ingenious methods of concealing one's true meaning: but we make use of an <HI>equivocation,</HI> to deceive; of an <HI>ambi∣guity,</HI> to keep in the dark, from all; and of a <HI>double-entendre,</HI> to conceal, from some.</P>
<P>It is beneath the character of an honest man, to make frequent use of <HI>equivocati∣ons;</HI> he that does, being sure to meet with the contempt of mankind. <HI>Ambiguities,</HI> are perhaps, oftener the effect of a confusion of ideas, than a studied design of keeping people in the dark: we ought never to use them, but when an elucidation would be dangerous. Malice and politeness have introduced the <HI>double-entendre,</HI> but it should never, be used, at the expence of our neighbours reputation.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="62" TYPE="part">
<PB N="77" REF="99"/>
<HEAD>62. <HI>Great, Big, Large.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The word <HI>great,</HI> is a general term, sig∣nifying any thing considerable either in bulk, extent, quality, number, &amp;c. thus we say, a <HI>great</HI> house; a <HI>great</HI> road; a <HI>great</HI> weight; a <HI>great</HI> many; a <HI>great</HI> fa∣mine; a <HI>great</HI> happiness. The words <HI>big,</HI> and, <HI>large,</HI> are more circumscribed; <HI>big,</HI> implies, greatness of bulk; <HI>large,</HI> greatness of extent. Thus, we say, a <HI>big</HI> man; a <HI>big</HI> stone; but, a <HI>large</HI> room; a <HI>large</HI> field.</P>
<P>A <HI>large</HI> man, is as great an impropriety, as a <HI>big</HI> field; and we need, only, mention a <HI>big</HI> or <HI>large</HI> pleasure, to shew the ab∣surdity.</P>

<P>We are <HI>staid,</HI> through discretion and custom; <HI>grave,</HI> thro' humour and consti∣tution; <HI>serious,</HI> thro' taste and affectation.</P>
<P>Levity is the reverse, of being <HI>staid;</HI> vi∣vacity, of <HI>gravity;</HI> wantonness, of <HI>seriousness.</HI></P>
<P>Aconstant round of business and continual transaction of affairs, make us <HI>staid;</HI> reflecti∣ons on our latter end, give <HI>gravity;</HI> the desire of being thought <HI>grave, seriousness.</HI></P>

<HEAD>64. <HI>Genius, Talent.</HI></HEAD>
<P>These are both born with us, and are a happy disposition of nature, by which, we are qualified for some peculiar employ∣ment: but <HI>genius,</HI> seems to be more inter∣nal, and possessed of the powers of inven∣tion; <HI>talent,</HI> more external, and capable of execution.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="101"/>Thus, we have a <HI>genius,</HI> for poetry and painting; but, a <HI>talent,</HI> for speaking and writing.</P>
<P>Such as have a <HI>genius</HI> for mechanics, may have no <HI>talent</HI> for watch-making.</P>

<P>The word <HI>people,</HI> is so very general, that it cannot be connected with a determinate number; as, for instance, four, five, or, six <HI>people;</HI> but that of <HI>persons,</HI> may.</P>
<P>To be pleasant at table, none should be admitted but <HI>people</HI> of good humour; neither, should there be more, than seven or eight <HI>persons.</HI></P>
<P>In order to describe a company, we should know the quality of the <HI>people,</HI> and the number of <HI>persons,</HI> present.</P>
<P>In all governments, we find ill-affected <HI>people:</HI> and there are, always, among a number, some discontented <HI>persons.</HI></P>

<HEAD>66. To <HI>Regard, Concern, Touch.</HI></HEAD>
<P>We say, very indifferently, without much choice, that a thing <HI>regards</HI> us, <HI>con∣cerns</HI> us, or, <HI>touches</HI> us, to mark the part we bear in it. There, nevertheless, appears to me, to be a delicate distinction between these three expressions, each rising, gra∣dually, above the other, according to the rank, in which, I have placed them. Tho' we have the least part, imaginable, in a thing, it may be said, to <HI>regard</HI> us; to <HI>concern</HI> us, we must have a greater; but, when we are sensibly affected by it, it may be said, to <HI>touch</HI> us. It seems also, that the word <HI>regard,</HI> is more applicable, when our interest is in question; that of <HI>concern,</HI> when speaking of things, committed to our care and conduct; that of <HI>touch,</HI> when it respects our honour of fortune.</P>
<P>The ill-behaviour of a servant, to a customer, <HI>regards</HI> the master; as it affects his interest. The least disturbance in Eu∣rope, in some measure, <HI>regards</HI> every state;
<PB N="81" REF="103"/>it being difficult, for any of them, to keep a perfect neutrality, for any length of time, while the others are at war.

<HEAD>67. <HI>Tranquillity, Peace, Quiet.</HI></HEAD>
<P>These words, let them be applied either to the soul, to a republic, or any particu∣lar society; express, equally, a situation exempt from trouble and molestation;
<PB N="82" REF="104"/>but <HI>tranquillity,</HI> relates to that, within one∣self, and in the time present, independent of any other relation: <HI>peace,</HI> to the situa∣tion, with regard to enemies, in whose power it is, to make an alteration: <HI>quiet,</HI> with respect to time past or future, as succeeding or preceding a situation trou∣bled.</P>
<P>Uneasy people have no <HI>tranquillity</HI> in their families. Litigious persons are hardly ever at <HI>peace</HI> with their neighbours. After a troublesome time, we enjoy a <HI>quiet</HI> state, with greater satisfaction.</P>
<P>What a state of <HI>tranquillity,</HI> does the re∣ligious man enjoy; no outward things having the power to rufflle or discompose him! To preserve <HI>peace,</HI> we should keep ourselves, always, in a state of defence. It is indulgence, only, that will establish <HI>quiet</HI> in a mutinous people.</P>

<P>Both these words signify, an edifice, set apart for the public service of religion;
<PB N="83" REF="105"/>but that of <HI>temple,</HI> is a more pompous ex∣pression, and less in use, than <HI>church:</HI> with respect to the Pagan religion, we, fre∣quently use the word <HI>temple:</HI> as the <HI>temple</HI> of Apollo; the <HI>temple</HI> of Janus; but with relation to our own, seldom: St. Paul's <HI>church;</HI> St. Saviour's <HI>church.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Temple,</HI> seems to express something, more august, and signifies, properly, and edifice, dedicated to the deity. <HI>Church</HI> something, more common, signifying, par∣ticularly, an edifice, erected for the con∣gregation of the faithful.</P>
<P>The grandeur of Solomon's <HI>temple,</HI> was beyond description. Nothing profane ought to enter the <HI>temple</HI> of the Lord.

<HEAD>69. <HI>Huge, Vast, Enormous, Immense.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The common idea of these words, is something, greatly, beyond the usual mea∣sure; but those, of <HI>huge,</HI> and, <HI>vast,</HI> relate, more, to such things, as are material; those, of <HI>enormous,</HI> and, <HI>immense,</HI> to such, as are ideal; with this difference, between them; that <HI>huge,</HI> implies, greatness in bulk; <HI>vast,</HI> greatness in extent; <HI>enormous,</HI> greatness in size, even to deformity and dreadful∣ness; <HI>immense,</HI> unlimited extent, even be∣yond expression. Thus, we say, a <HI>huge</HI> giant; a <HI>vast</HI> tract of land; an <HI>enormous</HI> crime; the <HI>immense</HI> expanse.</P>
<P>There are some promontories, so <HI>huge,</HI> as to shock the eye that views them. The desarts of Arabia, are so <HI>vast,</HI> that unless travellers carried their lodging and provi∣sion with them, they would perish, before they reached their journey's end. The sins of the presumptuous wretch, are so <HI>enormous,</HI> that he can have little hopes of salvation, but, in the infinite mercies of an all-gracious God. So great is the <HI>immen∣sity</HI>

<P><HI>Way,</HI> is much more extensive and gene∣ral, than <HI>road;</HI> and implies the passage from place to place, whether through the high <HI>road,</HI> or not: <HI>road,</HI> is much more li∣mited, and particular, and means the beaten way of travellers, from one town or city to another. Which, says the travel∣ler, is our best <HI>way</HI> to Hampton; the Hounslow <HI>road,</HI> or Kingston? either <HI>road,</HI> says his guide, is good; but when we come to Twittenham, the shortest <HI>way,</HI> is across the fields; tho' the pleasantest <HI>way,</HI> would be, to go by water.</P>
<P>As the word, <HI>way,</HI> is, often, used to sig∣nify, means; which, when considered as the intermediate step to attainment, is not, widely, different from that, of <HI>road;</HI> when we would adopt the figure of travelling, not to confuse our ideas, we, generally, make use of the word <HI>road:</HI> thus, dili∣gence
<PB N="86" REF="108"/>with perseverance, is the high <HI>road</HI> to preferment; yet, notwithstanding, <HI>way</HI> is a much more elegant expression: a strict adherence to the principles of christianity, is the direct <HI>way</HI> to heaven.</P>

<HEAD>71. <HI>Ways, Means.</HI></HEAD>
<P>We go, the <HI>ways;</HI> we use, the <HI>means.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ways,</HI> are the methods, we take, <HI>means,</HI> what, we put in execution, to succeed. The first word, enfolds in its idea, honour and probity; the last, pays little or no regard, but, to the end aimed at. Thus, good <HI>ways,</HI> are those, which are just; good <HI>means,</HI> those, which are sure.</P>
<P>Simoniacal practices, are very bad <HI>ways;</HI> but, very good <HI>means,</HI> of obtaining bene∣fices.</P>
<P>I cannot avoid here, taking notice of the ingrammatical impropriety, of annexing the singular number, to the word <HI>means;</HI> the fault, almost, of every speaker and writer; liberality, say they, is, <HI>a</HI> sure <HI>means,</HI> of becoming popular: there <HI>is,</HI> no better

<P>One, relates to the repetition of the same acts; the other, to a plurality of objects. We, <HI>often,</HI> disguise our thoughts: by doing the same thing, <HI>often,</HI> it becomes habitual. We, <HI>frequently,</HI> meet with traitors; we, <HI>frequently,</HI> do those things, which we re∣pent of, afterwards.</P>
<P>There are two other words, bearing an equal signification with <HI>often, viz. oft,</HI> and, <HI>oftentimes,</HI> but they being, no more, than the same word, abbreviated and lengthened; it is needless, to take any further notice of them.</P>

<P>One of these words, more properly, re∣lates to inability; the other, to impossibi∣lity.</P>
<P>We <HI>cannot</HI> serve two masters. It is <HI>im∣possible</HI> to execute two opposite orders, at the same time.</P>

<HEAD>74. <HI>Glory, Honour.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Glory,</HI> expresses something, more singu∣lar, than <HI>honour.</HI> The one, makes us un∣dertake, voluntarily, the most difficult things; the other, leads us, willingly, to the execution of the most rigorous exac∣tions.</P>
<P>Quest of <HI>glory,</HI> sometimes, stimulates the soldier's courage, even to rashness; and no∣tions

<P>An indifference to <HI>glory,</HI> may pass unno∣ticed; but not so, with respect to <HI>honour.</HI></P>
<P>It is customary, in conversation, to place interest, in opposition to <HI>glory;</HI> and incli∣nation, to <HI>honour:</HI> thus, we say, an author, who labours after <HI>glory,</HI> takes more pains in the completion of his piece; than he, who works, merely for interest: and, when an avaritious man lays out his money, it is more through <HI>honour,</HI> than inclination.</P>

<P>The <HI>answer,</HI> is made to a demand or a question, asked; the <HI>reply,</HI> to an answer or a remonstrance.</P>
<P>Academics are taught first, to start diffi∣culties, and then, to <HI>answer</HI> them. It is nobler, to hear a wise remonstrance, and, profit by it; than make any <HI>reply.</HI></P>
<P>The word, <HI>answer,</HI> is more extensive in its signification, than <HI>reply;</HI> we <HI>answer</HI> the questions of those, who ask us; the de∣mands, of such, as expect our services; the examination of counsel; the arguments of disputants; the letters we receive; and,
<PB N="91" REF="113"/>for all our conduct. The word, <HI>reply,</HI> is far more limited; it supposes a dispute, com∣menced from difference of sentiment; we <HI>reply,</HI> to the answer, of an author whose works we have criticised; to the reprimands of those, whose correction, we are unwilling to submit to; to pleaders; to an answer in chancery.</P>
<P>An <HI>answer,</HI> should be clear, true, and dictated by reason, and good sense; a <HI>reply,</HI> strong and convincing, armed by truth, and strengthened by experience.</P>
<P>We should teach children, as much as possible, to give nice and judicious <HI>ans∣wers;</HI> and convince them, that there is more honour, in listning, than in making <HI>replies</HI> to those, who have the goodness to instruct them.</P>

<DIV2 N="77" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>77. <HI>Danger, Hazard, Risk, Venture,</HI></HEAD>
<P>All these words, imply, chance of harm; but that, of <HI>danger,</HI> relates to the evil, that may happen; those, of <HI>hazard, risk,</HI> and, <HI>venture,</HI> to the good, we may lose; with
<PB N="92" REF="114"/>this difference, that, <HI>hazard,</HI> expresses some∣thing, near; <HI>risk,</HI> something, at a distance; <HI>venture,</HI> something, farther off, relating only to the possibility of events. Hence those expressions, in <HI>danger,</HI> of death; in <HI>hazard,</HI> of our life; by giving a loose to debau∣chery, we <HI>risk</HI> our health; nothing <HI>venture,</HI> nothing have.</P>
<P><HI>Danger,</HI> creates fear; <HI>hazard,</HI> alarm; <HI>risk,</HI> caution; but we, often <HI>venture,</HI> with the greatest satisfaction.</P>
<P>The avaritious man, spurred on by in∣terest, fears no <HI>danger; hazards</HI> his health and happiness; runs every <HI>risk</HI> that attends his profession; and, gladly, ventures his all, in search of that, which, if obtained, he would not have the spirit, to enjoy.</P>

<DIV2 N="78" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>78. <HI>Against, In spite of.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Both these, denote opposition; but, the expression, <HI>in spite of,</HI> implies, more resolu∣tion and greater force, than the word, <HI>against; against,</HI> supposing little, or no re∣sistance,
<PB N="93" REF="115"/>in the object opposed; but, <HI>in spite of,</HI> a considerable struggle.</P>
<P>We act <HI>against</HI> the will, or, <HI>against</HI> rule, and, <HI>in spite of</HI> oppositions.</P>
<P>The good man, does nothing, <HI>against</HI> the dictates of his conscience. The wicked man, commits sin, <HI>in spite of</HI> the punish∣ment, annexed to it.</P>
<P>Rashness, will attempt things, <HI>against</HI> all appearance of success; and resolution, will pursue the attempt, <HI>in spite of</HI> all the obstacles it meets with.</P>

<HEAD>79. <HI>Boldness, Audaciousness, Impudence, Effrontery,</HI></HEAD>
<P>There is a commendable <HI>holdness,</HI> that proceeds from a self-consciousness of worth; but the <HI>holdness,</HI> which is here meant, springs from ignorance; is brazen and presuming. <HI>Audaciousness,</HI> is a greater degree of <HI>boldness;</HI> such, as is steeled a∣gainst reproof; is rude and noisy. <HI>Impu∣dence</HI> consists, in being an utter stranger, to all kind of modesty; is scurrilous and abu∣sive. <HI>Effrontery,</HI> proceeds from pride, and
<PB N="94" REF="116"/>self-sufficiency; is overbearing and inso∣lent.</P>
<P>The <HI>bold,</HI> are unawed by diffidence; they speak, with great assurance; neither the quality or rank of those, they address, being able to disconcert them. The more you reprove the <HI>audacious</HI> man, the more it hardens him; he, wilfully, forgets the respect, due to his superiors, and, idly, imagines his boisterous behaviour, a dis∣tinguishing mark of manhood. The wea∣pons of the <HI>impudent,</HI> are sauciness and abuse; which, they take up at every turn; and, with which, they lay about them, in a most unmerciful manner. As great a cause of <HI>effrontery,</HI> as any, is the want of education; he, whom it possesses, is ar∣rogant and insolent, a stranger to good∣sense, and unacquainted with the rules of good-breeding.</P>

<P>Some kinds of merchandise, are far more <HI>profitable,</HI> than others. A good name is very <HI>advantageous,</HI> as, it serves to push us forward in the world. Loss of blood, to a feverish person, is very <HI>beneficial.</HI></P>
<P>Light <HI>profits,</HI> make a heavy purse. A seasonable word, spoke in favour, is, fre∣uently, of more <HI>advantage,</HI> than the great∣est services. The greatest <HI>benefit</HI> to the soul, is, a sincere repentance.</P>

<P>Though the common meaning of these words is, to fix both the eyes upon an ob∣ject, and look at it with wonder, intently and earnestly; yet, there is a great diffe∣rence between them: <HI>staring,</HI> implies, looking, with wonder and impudence; <HI>gazing,</HI> with wonder and respect.</P>

<P>As nearly synonymous, as these words may appear to be, there is, yet, a mani∣fest difference between them, but the dis∣tinction is so delicate, as to require some attention to discover it. <HI>Useful,</HI> in my opi∣nion, is more applicable to things, in use; to those we have often recourse to; and what, cannot be well done without: <HI>Ser∣viceable,</HI> to things, of service, such, as we, oftener, do without, than with: and such, as we little expect to have.

<P>A <HI>gulph,</HI> is supposed to have, many turns and windings; of which, when we have once set a step in, we cannot possibly get out, but are carried on, in spite of all our endeavours to the contrary. An <HI>abyss,</HI> is supposed to have, many uncertain and obscure roads, without end; in which, tho' we may, sometimes, stoop, in hopes of find∣ing a way out; yet, being deceived, we become disheartened, bewildered with doubts, and overwhelmed with despair.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="122"/>A loose woman, is a <HI>gulph</HI> of woe, all perishes there; virtue, riches, and health. Philosophy, teaches us, that man is, con∣tinually, wandering, in an <HI>abyss</HI> of dark∣ness.</P>

<P>Our <HI>determinations,</HI> should be just, to avoid repentance; our <HI>resolutions,</HI> fixed, to exclude variation.</P>
<P>Nothing is more disagreeable, both to ourselves and others; than to be, always, <HI>undetermined,</HI> in our affairs, and <HI>irresolute,</HI> in our proceedings.</P>

<P><HI>Value,</HI> rises from the intrinsic good∣ness of things; <HI>worth</HI> from the estimation, of them.</P>

<HEAD>92. <HI>Valley, Bottom, Vale, Dale.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Of these four words, <HI>valley,</HI> implies, a narrow space, situated between two hills; <HI>bottom,</HI> a like space, but, quaggy and disa∣greeable.
<PB N="107" REF="129"/><HI>Vale,</HI> signifies, a space, more extended: whereas, <HI>dale,</HI> means, rather, low lands.</P>
<P>The words, <HI>dale</HI> and <HI>vale,</HI> are, oftener, found in poetry; <HI>valley</HI> and <HI>bottom,</HI> in prose.</P>
<P><HI>Valleys</HI> are, for the most part, winding, and, as they receive water from the hills on each side, are, generally, converted into meads. He, whose house stands in a <HI>bot∣tom,</HI> cannot live on a more unhealthy spot.

<HEAD>93. <HI>Head, Chief.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The word <HI>head,</HI> is reckoned synonymous only, to <HI>chief,</HI> when used in a figurative sense; but, even then, it requires a diffe∣rent application. <HI>Head,</HI> agrees best, with respect to arrangement: <HI>chief,</HI> with regard to subordination. Thus, we say, the <HI>head</HI>
<PB N="108" REF="130"/>of a batallion, or, a ship; the <HI>chief</HI> of a party, or, an undertaking.</P>

<P>We say, remove the <HI>impediment;</HI> sur∣mount the <HI>obstacle;</HI> take away or vanquish the <HI>obstruction.</HI></P>
<P>Even small <HI>impediments,</HI> sometimes, prove such <HI>obstacles,</HI> as <HI>obstruct</HI> our best endeavours.</P>
<P>The word, <HI>impediment,</HI> seems to express something, rising from the nature and proper circumstances of what we are about; that, of <HI>obstacle,</HI> something, from a foreign cause; that of <HI>obstruction,</HI> some∣thing, proceeding from a superior force.</P>
<P>Every temptation, may be said, to <HI>im∣pede</HI>
<PB N="109" REF="131"/>our resolutions to virtue. The elo∣quence of Demosthenes, was the greatest <HI>obstacle,</HI> that Philip of Macedon found, in all his political undertakings, and which he could never surmount, but by force of arms.

<P>Of all order of words, there does not appear a more regular climax than in the above three; which seems to be compleat∣ed, by the word, KNOWLEDGE; but as that, has never been accounted synonymous with these, I shall take no notice of it, here.</P>
<P><HI>Learning,</HI> implies, simply, that know∣ledge, which we acquire, by our common study at school. <HI>Literature,</HI> denotes, po∣lite learning, or, an acquaintance with the BELLES LETTRES, and is rather, practical:
<PB N="110" REF="132"/>but <HI>erudition,</HI> signifies, great depth of knowledge, with a particular relation to that, which is speculative.</P>
<P>Without some degree of <HI>learning,</HI> 'tis impossible to pass well, through the world. There was a time, when the nobility piqued themselves, on being men of <HI>literature.</HI> A taste for <HI>erudition,</HI> will furnish infinite amusement, for a tranquil and retired life.</P>

<HEAD>96. To <HI>Inquire, Interrogate, Ask.</HI></HEAD>
<P>We <HI>inquire,</HI> we <HI>interrogate,</HI> we <HI>ask,</HI> in or∣der to know; but the verb, <HI>inquire,</HI> im∣plies, curiosity; that, of <HI>interrogate,</HI> au∣thority; that of <HI>ask,</HI> something, more, civil and respectful.</P>
<P>The words <HI>inquire,</HI> and <HI>interrogate,</HI> make sense, by themselves; but, to use the word <HI>ask,</HI> with propriety, we must add the mat∣ter to it; that is, to make the sense per∣fect, we must mention the thing we <HI>ask.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="133"/>'Tis the business of a spy, to make <HI>en∣quiries.</HI> Criminals are <HI>interrogated</HI> by the judge. The soldier <HI>asks</HI> orders from the commanding officer.</P>

<P>We <HI>shun,</HI> those persons, whom we would not see, or by whom, we would not be seen. We <HI>avoid,</HI> doing things, that are disagree∣able to us. We <HI>fly,</HI> both persons and things, which we fear and dread.</P>
<P>In the words, <HI>shun</HI> and <HI>avoid,</HI> which seem to have the nearest affinity to each other; there is this standing difference, that, the word, <HI>shun,</HI> is generally, ap∣plied to persons; that, of <HI>avoid,</HI> to things.</P>
<P>In order to <HI>fly,</HI> we turn to the opposite side, and get quick away, to prevent be∣ing taken; in order to <HI>shun,</HI> we take ano∣ther road, getting slily away, to <HI>avoid</HI> be∣ing seen, or to escape a trap; in order to <HI>avoid,</HI> we use some extraordinary means.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="134"/>We <HI>shun</HI> troublesome company. We <HI>avoid</HI> running into excess. We <HI>fly</HI> those, who pursue us.</P>
<P>Knowlege of the world, makes us <HI>shun.</HI> Prudence makes us <HI>avoid.</HI> Fear, makes us <HI>fly.</HI></P>
<P>The best remedy against the plague, is to <HI>fly</HI> far from the place where it is. The surest method of preserving our innocence, is to <HI>shun</HI> bad company. It is an act of the greatest weakness, not to <HI>avoid</HI> doing those things, which are detrimental to our in∣terest.</P>

<P><HI>Severity,</HI> shews itself, chiefly, in the manner of thinking and judging; it con∣demns readily and admits of no excuse. <HI>Ri∣gour,</HI> is seen, particularly, in the manner of punishing; it pardons nothing, nor lightens the stroke.</P>
<P>False-devotees are <HI>severe,</HI> only, to others, whom, they are ever eager to condemn; and are always, applauding their own ac∣tions. <HI>Rigour,</HI> can never be justifiable,

<HEAD>99. To <HI>Succour, Help,</HI> To <HI>Assist, Relieve.</HI></HEAD>
<P>We make use of the word, <HI>succour,</HI> in danger; <HI>help,</HI> in labour; <HI>assist,</HI> in want; <HI>relieve,</HI> in distress. The first, springs from a motive of generosity; the second, from good nature; the third, from humanity; the fourth, from compassion.</P>
<P>We give <HI>succour,</HI> in battle; we <HI>help,</HI> when we carry part of another's burden; we <HI>assist,</HI> the poor; and <HI>relieve,</HI> the af∣flicted.</P>
<P>The policy of states has found it neces∣sary to <HI>succour</HI> each other, when the pow∣er of any one of them, is gaining too great a head.

<HEAD>101. <HI>Diversity, Variety.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Diversity,</HI> supposes a change, which taste is always in search of; in order to dis∣cover some novelty that may enliven and delight it: <HI>variety,</HI> supposes a plurality of things, differing from each other in like∣ness, which cheers the imagination, apt to be cloyed with too great a uniformity.</P>
<P>Without some <HI>diversity,</HI> life would be, altogether, insipid. Nature has thrown infi∣nite <HI>variety</HI> among the smallest objects; which, if we cannot perceive, is owing to a defect of light.</P>
<P>An agreeable <HI>diversity</HI> of colours, will give as much pleasure to the eye, as har∣monious sounds to the ear. <HI>Variety</HI> of amusements, insensibly, lead us into a dis∣sipation.</P>

<DIV2 N="103" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>103. <HI>Ill, Sick.</HI></HEAD>
<P>These two words, are considered, only, as synonymous, when they imply, afflicted with disease; but, as indiscriminately, as they may be used, even in that sense, still, they convey different ideas, marking diffe∣rent degrees of illness. The word <HI>ill,</HI> in my opinion, is used, with most propriety, when health is the least impaired; that of <HI>sick,</HI> when the body is greatly diseased. Thus we say, when we find a heaviness upon the spirits, or, a want of appetite:
<PB N="117" REF="139"/>that we are <HI>ill;</HI> but when the whole frame of any one is disordered, we, naturally, say, he is <HI>sick.</HI></P>
<P>When we apply either of these words to ourselves, they carry very different mean∣ings; thus, I am <HI>ill,</HI> is general, and implies, disordered, in any part of the body; whereas, I am <HI>sick,</HI> is particular, and means, disordered, in the stomach.</P>
<P>There is, yet, a further distinction be∣tween them; <HI>Ill,</HI> is most applicable, when in pain only; <HI>sick,</HI> when diseased; thus, we say, he is <HI>ill</HI> of the gout; but, <HI>sick,</HI> of a fever.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="104" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>104. <HI>Disease, Distemper, Sickness.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Disease</HI> and <HI>distemper,</HI> imply, particular disorders, with this difference, that, <HI>disease</HI> is more applicable to man; <HI>distemper,</HI> to brutes; whereas, <HI>sickness,</HI> is more general, and may be applied to either.</P>
<P><HI>Diseases,</HI> such as the plague, fevers, &amp;c. are, sometimes, so epidemical, as to
<PB N="118" REF="140"/>lay waste more, than the sword. <HI>Distempers,</HI> among cattle, are, generally, infectious. Divine displeasure hath, often, shewn it∣self, by a general <HI>sickness,</HI> among men and beasts.</P>
<P>Both <HI>diseases</HI> and <HI>distempers,</HI> when, be∣come universal, are <HI>sicknesses,</HI> so severe, as draw the joint prayers of a people, in hopes, to avert them.</P>

<DIV2 N="105" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>105. <HI>Weary, Tired, Fatigued.</HI></HEAD>
<P>It is the continuation of the same thing, that either, <HI>wearies,</HI> or <HI>tires,</HI> with this dif∣ference, that, <HI>weary,</HI> implies, a less de∣gree; <HI>tired,</HI> a greater; but it is labour that <HI>fatigues.</HI> We grow <HI>weary,</HI> or <HI>tired</HI> with standing. We are <HI>fatigued</HI> with work.</P>
<P>When we are <HI>weary</HI> of a thing, to com∣plete it, we lack spirits; when, <HI>tired,</HI> we are, totally, unable; when <HI>fatigued,</HI> we want strength to go through it, as we would.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="141"/><HI>Weariness,</HI> proceeds, sometimes, from an unwillingness, in what we undertake; we are, frequently, <HI>tired,</HI> through disposition of body, and slow circulation of blood; but, <HI>fatigue,</HI> is, always, the consequence of much action; it supposes excess of work, with respect, either to difficulty or length of time.</P>
<P>In a figurative sense, a petitioner grows <HI>weary,</HI> through his impatience; <HI>tired,</HI> thro' his perseverance; and <HI>fatigued,</HI> through his importunities.</P>
<P>We are <HI>weary,</HI> with waiting; <HI>tired,</HI> with ill-success; and <HI>fatigued</HI> with pursuing.</P>

<P><HI>Lustre,</HI> seems to be possessed of polish, only; <HI>brilliancy,</HI> of light; but, <HI>radiancy,</HI> of fire.</P>
<P><HI>Lustre,</HI> shines, only; <HI>brilliancy,</HI> dazzles; but, <HI>radiancy,</HI> glares.</P>
<P>We, seldom, make use of the word <HI>lustre,</HI> but, in the literal sense; whereas, we, frequently, use that, of <HI>radiancy,</HI> and,
<PB N="121" REF="143"/>much more often, that, of <HI>brilliancy,</HI> in the figurative. Considered then, in this sense, it appears to me, that, it is the force of truth, the energy of language, and the newness of the thoughts, that give <HI>radiancy,</HI> to a discourse; whereas, <HI>brilliancy,</HI> rises from the beautiful turns and lively touches of expression: and that, it is the choice of words, the agreement of terms, and the ar∣rangement of phrases, that give a <HI>lustre,</HI> to what is said.</P>

<P><HI>Wisdom,</HI> makes us act and speak, pro∣perly; <HI>prudence,</HI> prevents our speaking, or acting, improperly.

<P><HI>Wisdom,</HI> is more knowing; <HI>prudence,</HI> more wary.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="144"/>The <HI>wise</HI> man, makes use of those means, that are most proper for his purpose; he conducts himself, by the light of reason. The <HI>prudent,</HI> man, takes those ways, he thinks most sure; he does not venture, in∣to places unknown.</P>
<P>An ancient writer, has said, that, it is a mark of <HI>wisdom,</HI> not to talk on any sub∣ject, but what, we are thorough masters of, especially, if we would be esteemed: we, may add to this maxim, that, it is a piece of <HI>prudence,</HI> not to bring a disagreeable sub∣ject on the tapis, particularly, if we are de∣sirous of being beloved.</P>

<P>We, generally, use the word, <HI>situation,</HI> as relative, to affairs, rank or fortune; <HI>condition,</HI> with respect, to the nature, qua∣lity or property of a thing; and that, of <HI>state,</HI> applying it to health, or, our well or ill-being.</P>

<P>These words are all in use, when the bare expression, only, of ideas, is in ques∣tion.

<P>The word <HI>sentiment,</HI> is used, with more propriety, when the subject, is on taste. That, Homer is an excellent poet, is the <HI>sentiment,</HI> of every man of learning.

<HEAD>117. <HI>Angry, In a Passion, Passionate.</HI></HEAD>
<P>An impatient agitation, or, rising of the blood, against any one, who has offended us, is the common import of the two first, of these terms: The word, <HI>angry,</HI> implies, a passion more internal and lasting; where∣as the expression, <HI>in a passion,</HI> carries in its idea, a sudden, external gust of anger; short, but violent.</P>
<P><HI>Anger,</HI> shall, sometimes, brood in the breast, for years; till at last it becomes, as it were, fixed and settled; sometimes, it will dissemble, for a long while together; but, often, finds it extremely difficult to pardon: On the contrary, it is the gene∣ral characteristic of those, who are <HI>in a passion,</HI> to forgive, as soon as it subsides; which may, perhaps, be the next quarter of an hour; besides, the man, <HI>in a passion,</HI> cannot dissemble; his violence of <HI>anger,</HI> must have vent; when that's obtained, he is as cool as before: indeed, his <HI>passion,</HI> will now and then, settle into confirmed
<PB N="132" REF="154"/><HI>anger,</HI> but when that is the case, it is, ge∣nerally, owing to repeated offences.</P>
<P>With respect to the word, <HI>passionate,</HI> there is a wide difference, between the man <HI>in a passion,</HI> and the <HI>passionate</HI> man; the one, being extraordinary, the other, ordinary.</P>
<P>Few men, for example, can avoid being <HI>in a passion,</HI> when, they are, greatly, of∣fended; but <HI>passionate</HI> people, are heated, on the most trifling occasions.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="228" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>118. <HI>Hasty, Passionate.</HI></HEAD>
<P>According to my conception, it appears, that <HI>hasty,</HI> relates, more, to action or blows; and that, <HI>passionate,</HI> goes seldom farther, than words.</P>
<P>A <HI>hasty</HI> man, is apt to lift his hand; it is, generally, with him, a word and a blow. A <HI>passionate</HI> man, will vent his anger in words, only.</P>
<P>We should be upon our guard, when, with <HI>hasty</HI> people; and have patience, with the <HI>passionate.</HI></P>

<HEAD>119. <HI>Strong, Robust, Stout, Sturdy.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Strength,</HI> is, chiefly, owing to the con∣struction of the muscles. A little man is, often, <HI>stronger,</HI> than a greater. <HI>Robustness,</HI> carries with it, an idea of lustiness, is less subject to infirmities, and, much owing to constitution. A short man, may be <HI>robust.</HI> By <HI>stout,</HI> we understand tall and strong∣made. A little man, tho' never so <HI>strong,</HI> cannot be called, <HI>stout.</HI> By <HI>sturdy,</HI> we mean <HI>stout,</HI> with a degree of hardiness.</P>
<P><HI>Strength,</HI> gives a man an advantage over his enemies; <HI>robustness,</HI> lends him, an air of dignity and authority; <HI>stoutness,</HI> makes him, admired; <HI>sturdiness,</HI> is accompanied, with an air of meanness.</P>

<P><HI>Complaisance,</HI> rises from the respect we shew those, whom we meet; is, sometimes, sincere, sometimes, not; <HI>politeness,</HI> from the flattering methods, we make use of in our behaviour and conversation; and is, gene∣rally, insincere; but, to be <HI>well-bred,</HI> is to shew the same honours, always, with sin∣cerity.</P>
<P><HI>Complaisance,</HI> is the characteristic of the lover; <HI>politeness,</HI> of the courtier; but, to be <HI>well-bred,</HI> denotes, the gentleman.</P>
<P>We should be <HI>complaisant,</HI> without im∣portunity; and <HI>polite,</HI> without insipidity. The distinguishing mark of a <HI>well-bred</HI> man, is, the constant care he takes, never to disgust or offend.</P>

<HEAD>121. <HI>Hump-backed, Crocked, Deformed.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The true meaning of the word, <HI>hump∣backed,</HI> is, having a rising, upon the back, owing either to <HI>crookedness,</HI> or some other cause, and may be either natural or acci∣dental: tho' the words, <HI>crooked</HI> and <HI>deform∣ed,</HI> convey other ideas, still nothing is more common, than to find them, fre∣quently, in use to express the same as <HI>hump-backed.</HI> By <HI>crookedness,</HI> is understood, any deviation from natural straitness. <HI>De∣formity,</HI> implies, any part of the body being imperfect or unnatural. Thus, a man is <HI>crooked,</HI> if any ways, twisted or bent from the natural shape; and <HI>deformed,</HI> if he has an eye, a finger, or, a toe, too little, or, too much. We may be <HI>hump-backed,</HI> or, <HI>crook∣ed,</HI> by a fall, or, some other accident; but <HI>deformed,</HI> we cannot be, otherwise, than by a defect or exuberance in nature.</P>

<P><HI>Perfection,</HI> regards, properly, the beauty, which rises from the design and construction of the work; <HI>finishing,</HI> from the workman∣ship and hand, of the workman. <HI>Completion,</HI> depends upon the want of nothing; but, on the work's having every thing, it should have. The first, excludes all sorts of de∣fect. The second, shews a particular care and attention, to the minutest article. The third, respects more, the totality of parts.</P>

<P>Each, of these words, denotes, a sad event; but, that, of <HI>misfortune,</HI> is applied to

<P>It is a <HI>misfortune,</HI> to lose our money or our friend. It is a <HI>disaster,</HI> to fall or be wounded. It is a <HI>calamity,</HI> to find our∣selves, suddenly, disgraced and ruined in the world.</P>
<P>We say, a great <HI>misfortune;</HI> a shocking <HI>disaster;</HI> and a dreadful <HI>calamity.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Misfortunes,</HI> will happen to the best of men. We bring <HI>disasters,</HI> frequently, upon ourselves, thro' want of proper care. <HI>Ca∣lamities,</HI> are, often, sent by heaven, upon the wicked, to rouse them, from their sin∣ful lethargy.</P>

<P><HI>Management,</HI> respects, only, private things, trusted to the care of some one, to employ for the profit of another, and, to whom, he is to render an account; as that of a clerk, to his master. <HI>Direction,</HI> relates to certain affairs, where, there is a distribu∣tion, either of money, office or whatever
<PB N="139" REF="161"/>else, is committed to the care of another, to preserve necessary order. <HI>Administration,</HI> refers to objects of greater consequence, such, as those of justice, or, the finances of a state; it supposes a pre-eminence of employ, which gives power, credit, and, a kind of liberty, in the department, the person is engaged in. <HI>Conduct,</HI> points out some knowledge and ability, with respect to things; and, a subordination, with re∣gard to persons. <HI>Government,</HI> results from authority and dependance; it indicates a superiority of office, with a particular rela∣tion, to policy.</P>
<P>Whosoever has the <HI>management</HI> of any one's concerns in trust; should be as at∣tentive and as careful, as if they were his own. He, who undertakes the <HI>direction</HI> of public charities; should divest himself of all prejudice and partiality. A judge ought to be wisely circumspect in the <HI>ad∣ministration</HI> of justice; and, a prime mi∣nister intently wary, in the <HI>administration</HI> of public affairs. No one thing should be committed to the <HI>conduct</HI> of another, un∣less, we are well perswaded, he has abili∣ties, adequate to the task; and will act in conformity, to the intentions of him, whose
<PB N="140" REF="162"/>business he undertakes. The man, who, thro' favour of his prince, is offered the helm of <HI>government;</HI> should, seriously, re∣flect on the arduous office; and not suffer his ambition, to get the better of his dis∣cretion.</P>

<HEAD>126. <HI>Affront, Insult, Abuse,</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Affront,</HI> is an arrow of reproach and con∣tempt, shot in public; it piques and mor∣tifies those, who have any sense of honour. <HI>Insult,</HI> is an attack, made with insolence; it is, usually, repelled with spirit. Both <HI>affronts</HI> and <HI>insults,</HI> may be given without words; but, <HI>abuse</HI> results, chiefly, from scurrilous language.</P>
<P><HI>Affronts,</HI> are, often, given through the childish itch of revenge. <HI>Insults,</HI> are, too frequently the offspring of pride. We seldom, if ever, hear <HI>abuse,</HI> in the mouth of a well-bred man.</P>

<P>In the literal sense; it is, the walls, the ditches, the courts, the gardens, the ave∣nues that forms the <HI>outside</HI> of a castle; but it is, the figures, the grandeur, the situation, and, the architecture, that determines the <HI>ap∣pearance:</HI> the <HI>outside,</HI> being the external part of a thing; the <HI>appearance,</HI> the effect, which a view of that thing produces, or the idea, we form of it, by that view.</P>

<P>Taking these words in the sense, of hav∣ing power over the minds of others; <HI>weight,</HI> implies, prevalence, tho' small; <HI>influence,</HI> seems to have more force; <HI>sway,</HI> is more absolute.</P>
<P>Superiority of rank and reason, gives <HI>weight;</HI> it is commonly by persuasion, that it acts.

<P>The <HI>weight</HI> we have with others, pro∣ceeds, always, from some worth, in our∣selves, either of mind, birth or fortune. <HI>Influence</HI> is owing to some tye, either of

<HEAD>137. <HI>Authority, Power, Dominion,</HI></HEAD>
<P>We find in the word, <HI>authority,</HI> suffici∣ent energy to make us perceive a right, either of civil or politic administration. There is in the word, <HI>power,</HI> a particular relation to the subordinate execution of
<PB N="151" REF="173"/>superior orders. The word, <HI>dominion,</HI> carries with it, an idea of empire.</P>
<P>It is the law, which gives <HI>authority;</HI> it deriving all its might, from thence. <HI>Power,</HI> is invested in delegates, those, to whom the execution of the laws is entrusted, and is, consequently, in subordination to <HI>au∣thority. Dominion,</HI> springs from the joint consent of the people, or, from the force of arms, and, is either lawful or tyran∣nical.</P>
<P>We are happy, in living under the <HI>autho∣rity</HI> of a Prince, who prides himself in justice; whose ministers assume no <HI>power,</HI> beyond what is legal; and, who makes the welfare of his subjects, the basis of his <HI>dominion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Authority,</HI> if weak, is exposed to con∣tempt; it is, equally, as dangerous, not to make use of it on proper occasions, as, even, to abuse it. A blind <HI>power,</HI> which acts in opposition to justice, becomes odious, and paves the way to its own ruin. A jealous <HI>dominion,</HI> that admits of no sharer, makes itself formidable; awakens, on that ao∣count, the ardor of its enemies, and, thus, ushers in its own fall.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="174"/>There appears to me, particularly, in the idea of <HI>authority,</HI> something just and re∣spectable; in the idea of <HI>power,</HI> something strong and active; and, in the idea of <HI>domi∣uion,</HI> something great and elevated.</P>
<P>As there is none but God, that has an unlimited <HI>authority;</HI> so, there is none else, who has infinite <HI>power;</HI> neither is there any absolute, sovereign, and independent <HI>domini∣on,</HI> than his.</P>
<P>Nature has established no <HI>authority</HI> among men, but that of fathers, over their children; all other, proceeds from positive right. The <HI>power</HI> of the passions, is the true spring of action, and, determines us, with respect, either to good or evil.

<P><HI>Gain,</HI> seems to arise from something ve∣ry casual; and implies, risk and hazard; it is for this reason, the word, is in great use among gamesters and tradesmen. <HI>Pro∣fit,</HI> appears to be more sure; proceeding either from lands or industry. Thus, we say, the <HI>profits</HI> of the earth; or, the <HI>profits</HI> of our labour. The characteristic of <HI>lu∣cre,</HI> consists in a simple relation, to the passion of interest; 'tis on this account,
<PB N="155" REF="177"/>we say, with the greatest propriety, that man is fond of <HI>lucre. Emolument</HI> relates to commissions and employments; intimating, not only the salaries, but, all other per∣quisites.</P>
<P>Some persons are so particularly rigid, as to condemn all <HI>gain,</HI> arising from play. Many will, idly, call that <HI>profit,</HI> which has accrued by illicit means. It is low and sordid, to be ever led by <HI>lucre.</HI> We do not, always, find the greatest honour, in of∣fices, where there is the greatest <HI>emolu∣ment.</HI></P>

<HEAD>141. <HI>Very, Extremely.</HI></HEAD>
<P>We are apt to use these words indiffe∣rently, one as well as the other, to express a great degree of any thing. Thus, for example, we say, in the same sense, <HI>very</HI> wise; <HI>extremely</HI> wise; notwithstanding this, there appears to me some difference be∣tween them: The word, <HI>very,</HI> marks an extraordinary degree; but <HI>extremely,</HI> a de∣gree to admiration. Thus, we say, men
<PB N="156" REF="178"/>are, <HI>very,</HI> wicked: Providence is, <HI>extremely,</HI> kind.</P>
<P>Besides this distinction, there is one more delicate, which is, that <HI>very,</HI> does not suit well, but in the literal and natural sense; for when we say, a man is <HI>very</HI> wise; we would be understod, as saying; truly wise, whereas <HI>extremely,</HI> may be used with ele∣gance, in an ironical sense. We say, then, in raillery, he is, <HI>extremely,</HI> wise, in ceasing to pursue that, he knows not how to get at; and, <HI>extremely,</HI> patient, in taking a blow calmly, he has not the spirit to return.</P>

<P>Of these words, that of <HI>fantistical,</HI> implies, a rambling from true taste, thro excess of delicacy, or, an unseasonable search after something better. That of <HI>whimsical,</HI> means, an affectation of singula∣rity. By <HI>maggotty,</HI> is understood, a great inconstancy, or, sudden change of taste. <HI>Fanciful,</HI> implies, a certain revolu∣tion of humour, or, a particular way of thinking.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="179"/>There cannot be a more despicable crea∣ture, than the <HI>fantastical</HI> fop; he tricks out his charming self, in hopes of attract∣ing the respect of mankind; but, on the contrary, meets, only, with scorn and con∣tempt. The <HI>whimsical</HI> man, if his invention be fertile, is, sometimes, an object of present admiration; but, on serious reflection, is, too frequently, the subject of ridicule. A <HI>maggotty</HI> person, is, equally, tireforne to himself and to others; as what pleases him, one minute, shall, often, displease him, the next. He, who is <HI>fanciful,</HI> is far more troublesome to himself, than to others; for being led away by his wild imagination, he, fondly, believes many things to be real, which, in fact are, only, ideal.</P>

Thus, we say, a <HI>little</HI> house; a <HI>little</HI> man; a <HI>little</HI> cup; a <HI>little</HI> globe: but, a <HI>small</HI> thread; a <HI>small</HI> line; a <HI>small</HI> twig.</P>

<P>The traveller <HI>remarks,</HI> that, which strikes him most; the spy, <HI>observes</HI> those proceed∣ings, which he thinks of consequence.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="181"/>It is the part of a general to <HI>remark</HI> those, of his men, who distinguish them∣selves in battle; and, <HI>observe</HI> the motions, of the enemy.</P>

<P>Those, who <HI>observe</HI> the conduct of others, in order, to <HI>remark</HI> their faults; do it, rather, through a delight in censuring, than, a desire of correcting their own errors.</P>

Thus, we say, he is <HI>gone back</HI> into his own coun∣try. He is <HI>returned</HI> home. We say, also, he is <HI>gone back</HI> from virtue; he has <HI>returned</HI> to his fault.</P>

<P>When in conversation, our <HI>ideas</HI> are just; our <HI>thoughts,</HI> fine; and, our <HI>imaginati∣ons,</HI> brilliant; we shall be sure to please: and, our <HI>notions,</HI> tho' singular, will, al∣ways, be respectable.</P>

The word, <HI>business,</HI> by its having no plu∣ral number, intimates a particular employ; by the singular of <HI>affairs,</HI> being seldom in use, in the sense before us, that word is

<P>The man of much <HI>business,</HI> ought to have a strong constitution. He, who has many <HI>affairs</HI> to settle, tho' he may have a clear head, will find it difficult, to adjust them all, to his satisfaction.</P>

<HEAD>149. To <HI>Take, Choose.</HI></HEAD>
<P>When we would <HI>take</HI> a thing, we de∣termine upon one, because, we cannot have all. We <HI>choose,</HI> by comparing things, be∣cause, we would have the best. The one, supposes a simple determination of the will; the other, a discernment of the mind.</P>
<P>Between two things, exactly alike, we may determine, which to <HI>take,</HI> when at the same time, there is no <HI>choice.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="184"/>We are sometimes constrained to <HI>take</HI> one thing, out of many, when we are not obliged to <HI>choose.</HI></P>
<P>We cannot use the word <HI>take,</HI> but, with respect to ourselves; but we <HI>choose,</HI> some∣times, for others.</P>
<P>It is a point of good-manners, when of∣fered fruit or any other thing, where there is <HI>choice;</HI> to <HI>take,</HI> that, which comes first to hand: but, when we would present any thing of the like sort, to a stranger, it is a mark of politeness, to <HI>choose</HI> for him the best.</P>
<P>When things are at our <HI>option,</HI> that is, when we may <HI>take,</HI> which we please; we should try to make a good <HI>choice.</HI></P>
<P>Between a good course of life and a bad, there is no medium; we must either <HI>take</HI> the one or the other. Nothing appears more difficult to me, than the <HI>choice</HI> of a friend.</P>

<HEAD>150. To <HI>Choose, Make choice of</HI></HEAD>
<P>The word, <HI>choose,</HI> is most, in its place, with respect to things, we would make use of. The expression, <HI>make choice of,</HI> is, more proper, when it relates to persons, we would appoint to any dignity or em∣ploy.</P>
<P>George, the third, <HI>chose,</HI> the Queen's palace, as his place of residence in town; and, <HI>made choice of</HI> Caesar Hawkins, to in∣oculate his children.</P>
<P>To <HI>choose,</HI> indicates, more particularly, a comparison made between things, in or∣der, to know, which is best to take; to <HI>make choice of,</HI> marks with greater precisi∣on, the simple determination of one per∣son preferable to another.</P>
<P>Princes do not, always, <HI>choose</HI> their minis∣ters; neither, do they, always, <HI>make choice of</HI> a Talbot, for a chancellor; nor, a Marlbo∣rough, for a general.</P>

<HEAD>151. To <HI>Choose, Prefer.</HI></HEAD>
<P>We do not, always, <HI>choose,</HI> what, we <HI>pre∣fer:</HI> but, we ever <HI>prefer,</HI> that, which we <HI>choose.</HI></P>
<P>To <HI>choose,</HI> is, to determine in favour of a thing, either on account of its merit, or, its value. To <HI>prefer,</HI> is, to determine in its favour, by any motive whatsoever; whether it be merit, affection, good-man∣ners, policy, or, what not.</P>
<P>'Tis the judgment, that makes the <HI>choice;</HI> the heart, that gives the <HI>preference.</HI> 'Tis for this reason, that we, commonly, <HI>choose,</HI> what, we are acquainted with; and, <HI>prefer,</HI> what, we love.</P>
<P>Prudence, sometimes, forbids our <HI>choosing</HI> that, which strikes the eye most. Jus∣tice will not, often, permit us to <HI>prefer</HI> our friends, to other people.</P>
<P>In <HI>choosing</HI> a state of life, I think there can be no harm in <HI>preferring</HI> that, which is most agreeable to our inclinations; as, in
<PB N="165" REF="187"/>so doing, we should, naturally, find more satisfaction in our duty.</P>
<P><HI>Choice,</HI> is either good or bad, according to our taste, or, the knowledge we have in things. <HI>Preference,</HI> is, either just or unjust, as reason dictates, or, passion in∣spires.</P>
<P>Partial <HI>preference,</HI> is, sometimes, allow∣ed to princes in the distribution of their honours; but, they should, always, make <HI>choice</HI> of the ablest men, in their appoint∣ments to public offices.</P>

<P>The word, <HI>exchange,</HI> means, simply, in a general sense, the act of exchanging one thing for another, be it, what it may: the other two, are in use to denominate the particular kinds or methods of <HI>exchange;</HI> of which, this is the difference, that, the word, <HI>truck,</HI> is used, with most propriety, when speaking of serviceable things, such as are moveable; as the <HI>trucking</HI> of horses, trinkets, utensils, &amp;c. Whereas,
<PB N="171" REF="193"/><HI>barter,</HI> is a more mercantile expression, and intimates the <HI>exchange</HI> of different commo∣dities, by way of traffic.

<P><HI>Uncertainty,</HI> requires caution; <HI>doubt,</HI> con∣sideration; <HI>suspence,</HI> patience.</P>
<P>A wise man is seldom <HI>uncertain,</HI> as to what shall happen; he foresees future events, and prepares himself for them.

<P><HI>Dejection,</HI> is, commonly, caused by great affliction, and is, too often, a mark of de∣spair. <HI>Melancholy,</HI> is, generally, the effect of constitution; its cloudy ideas overpower and banish all that are chearful. <HI>Low∣spiritedness,</HI> is involuntary, and, often, pro∣ceeds from a weakness of nerves: excess of joy, fatigue, bad digestion, will occa∣sion it. <HI>Dullness,</HI> on the contrary, is vo∣luntary; it arises, frequently, from discon∣tent, disappointment, and from any other circumstance that may displease the mind.</P>
<P>The mind, in <HI>dejection,</HI> is unhappy, not having sufficient strength and reason to get the better of it. <HI>Melancholy,</HI> will, sometimes, wear away, by frequent diversion and dissi∣pation. A person, subject to <HI>low-spirits,</HI> should pursue a regular course of life, and a uniform method of living. <HI>Dullness</HI> is encreased by giving way to it; it is in our power to banish it, whenever we please, and the damp it throws on every company,

<P>The reverse of <HI>dejection,</HI> is joy; the re∣verse of <HI>melancholy,</HI> chearfulness; gaiety is the opposite, to <HI>low-spiritedness;</HI> and spright∣liness, to <HI>dullness.</HI></P>

<P>A <HI>piercing</HI> mind, sees things, even, through the veils, that cover them; it is difficult, to conceal truth from it; it will not suffer itself, to be deceived.

So that the first of these words, denotes properly, the length of duration, although, there may be intervals, and, different renewals; and, the second, marks simply, the unity of that duration, independent either of length, or,
<PB N="183" REF="205"/>shortness of the time; it is, for this reason, we say, a <HI>continual</HI> noise; <HI>continual</HI> rains; but, a <HI>continued</HI> stream; and, in music, a <HI>continued</HI> base.</P>
<P><HI>Continual</HI> interruptions will make us weary of the best undertakings. In coun∣tries, situated near the poles, there is, for the space of five or six months together, one <HI>continued</HI> darkness, insomuch, that the inhabitants, during that time, are obliged to leave the place.</P>

<P><HI>Yet,</HI> seems, to have more force and energy; it assures, with firmness, in spite of every opposition. <HI>In the mean while,</HI> is less absolute, it affirms, only, against con∣trary appearances. <HI>However,</HI> distinguishes two things, which seem opposite; support∣ing one without hurting the other. <HI>Never∣theless,</HI> affirms a thing, by exception; giv∣ing us to understand, that it does not oc∣cur, but, at the time, we are speak∣ing.</P>
<P>Though the whole earth is in arms against truth, <HI>yet,</HI> it does not prevent its triumphing.

<P><HI>Pride,</HI> is, unreasonable or inordinate self-esteem. <HI>Arrogance,</HI> implies, taking much upon ourselves, and, is <HI>pride</HI> attend∣ed with insolence and contempt. <HI>Vanity,</HI> is accompanied with affectation, and, means, <HI>pride,</HI> exerted, on slight grounds. By <HI>pre∣sumption,</HI> is understood, a blind, and, ad∣venturous confidence; with respect to <HI>haugh∣tiness,</HI> it is a mixture of softness and inso∣lence, the immediate effect of <HI>pride.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>haughtiness</HI> of the <HI>proud</HI> man, is in∣sufferable. <HI>Pride</HI> makes us value ourselves; <HI>arrogance,</HI> despise others; Through <HI>vanity,</HI> we covet the attention of our acquaintance. <HI>Presumption</HI> flatters us, with having a vain power.</P>
<P>The <HI>proud,</HI> consider themselves, in their own mind; full, and, self-swoln, they are taken up, with their own person. The <HI>arrogant,</HI> claim to themselves, what they have not the least pretentions to, are ready
<PB N="187" REF="209"/>to insult those, who will not allow them, what they claim; and look down, on the rest of the world, with contempt. The <HI>vain,</HI> value themselves, upon the opinion of others; greedy of esteem, they are ea∣ger, to engross the attention of all man∣kind. The <HI>presumptious,</HI> carry their audaci∣ous hopes, even to chimeras; bold, to un∣dertake, they, fondly, imagine they have power to do every thing.</P>
<P>The greatest pain, we can, possibly, give the <HI>proud</HI> man, is, by laying his defects, before his eyes. We cannot hurt the <HI>arro∣gant,</HI> so much, as by silent contempt. We cannot mortify a <HI>vain</HI> man more, than by paying no attention, to those qualifica∣tions or qualities, he prides himself in.

<P>We perform a <HI>cure.</HI> We procure a <HI>re∣medy.</HI> The first, relates more to the mala∣dy, and, to the action of him, who heals it; the second, has more relation to health, and, the state of the malady, we heal. We say, of a <HI>cure,</HI> that, it is fine; when its success, does honour to the person, who formed it; and, we say, of a <HI>remedy,</HI> that, it is certain, or, sure; when its operations are efficacious; that is, when it produces those consequences, we intended; and, we say of both, that, they are, either, easy, or, difficult.</P>
<P><HI>Cure,</HI> seems to have no other object, than stubborn disorders, and those, which proceed from constitution; whereas, <HI>re∣medy,</HI> has a view to slight complaints, and, such, as are of short duration.</P>

<P>The <HI>slothful</HI> man, will not work, at all. The <HI>lazy</HI> man, is drawn to it, with diffi∣culty. The <HI>sluggish</HI> man is slow, through the whole operation.</P>
<P>Industry, is the reverse of <HI>sloth;</HI> acti∣vity, of <HI>laziness;</HI> expedition, of <HI>sluggish∣ness.</HI></P>
<P>He, who is <HI>slothful,</HI> is a murderer of time. <HI>Laziness,</HI> is its own punishment. A <HI>sluggish</HI> person, is fit for no kind of em∣ployment, seldom doing any thing well, he undertakes.</P>

Those of <HI>harm,</HI> and, <HI>hurt,</HI> relate more to the person, or, character; with this difference, that <HI>harm,</HI> seems to denote, a small degree of <HI>hurt; hurt,</HI> a great degree of <HI>harm. Mischief,</HI> implies, ill, to the per∣son, or, property, and appears, ever, to be done, with an evil intent. <HI>Injury,</HI> intimates, a degree of <HI>hurt,</HI> without justice; and re∣lates to the character, or, property. <HI>De∣triment,</HI> carries an idea of loss, and, is sel∣dom used, but, with, regard to property.</P>
<P>By wounding a man, more or less, we <HI>harm,</HI> or, <HI>hurt,</HI> his person.

<P><HI>Enmity,</HI> does not, always, destroy our esteem for an enemy, nor, prevent our do∣ing him the justice, he is entitled to; but, it will not admit of our caressing him, or, doing him any good, otherwise, than through a sense of honour, or, greatness of soul; to which, we, sometimes, sacrifice our vengeance. <HI>Rancour,</HI> makes us embrace, with pleasure, every opportunity of re∣venging ourselves; but, can hide itself, with the cloak of friendship, 'till the very moment it begins to act.</P>

<P><PB N="205" REF="227"/>We, often, imagine that, what, others <HI>insinuate,</HI> was first thought of, by ourselves. He, who <HI>suggests</HI> evil to another, is much more culpable, than he, who commits it.</P>

<DIV2 N="197" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>197. <HI>Ordinary, Common.</HI></HEAD>
<P>These words, have been reputed syno∣nymous, in two senses; as implying, fre∣quent use; and, meaning, of little or no value: but, they are different in both. In the first sense, the word, <HI>ordinary,</HI> seems to me, to be best applied, when the repe∣tition of actions, is in question; <HI>common,</HI> when a multitude of objects. Thus, no∣thing is more <HI>ordinary</HI> at court, than dis∣simulation. Monsters are <HI>common</HI> in Africa.</P>
<P>In the second, that, which is <HI>ordinary,</HI> has nothing, to distinguish it; that, which is <HI>common,</HI> has nothing, to make it sought after.</P>

<PB N="206" REF="228"/>
<HEAD>198. To <HI>Hear, Hearken.</HI></HEAD>
<P>To <HI>hear,</HI> implies, having the ear struck with any sound. To <HI>hearken,</HI> means, to lend an ear, in order, to <HI>hear.</HI> Sometimes, we <HI>hear,</HI> without <HI>hearkening;</HI> and, we, of∣ten, <HI>hearken,</HI> without <HI>hearing.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="199" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>199. To <HI>Understand, Comprehend, Conceive.</HI></HEAD>
<P>To have just and proper ideas of every thing, that occurs, is the common signifi∣cation of these words: but, to <HI>under∣stand,</HI> implies, a conformity of ideas, which has a peculiar relation to the value of the terms, we use; to <HI>comprehend,</HI> de∣notes, such a conformity, as answers direct∣ly, to the nature of the things, we explain; and that, which is expressed by the word,
<PB N="207" REF="229"/><HI>conceive,</HI> relates, more especially, to the order and design, of what, we propose. The first, is used, with propriety, when, applied to the particulars, of what, we say; the tone, with which, we speak; the turn of our phrases; and, the delicacy of our expressions. The second, seems to agree best, with a relation to principles, lessons, precepts, and, speculative knowledge. The third, appears with greater elegance, when, it relates to forms, arrangement, projects, and, plans; in short, all that depends on the imagination.</P>
<P>We <HI>understand</HI> languages. We <HI>compre∣hend</HI> sciences. We <HI>conceive,</HI> whatever has relation to arts.</P>
<P>It is difficult to <HI>understand</HI> that, which is enigmatical; to <HI>comprehend</HI> that, which is abstruse; and, to <HI>conceive</HI> that, which is confused.</P>
<P>Readiness of <HI>understanding,</HI> is a mark of acuteness; that, of <HI>comprehension,</HI> is, a proof of penetration; that, of <HI>conception,</HI> denotes, a clear head.</P>
<P>A lover, <HI>understands</HI> the language of the passions. A learned man, <HI>comprehends</HI> the metaphysical questions of the schools. An
<PB N="208" REF="230"/>architect, <HI>conceives</HI> the plan and oeconomy of buildings.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="200" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>200. <HI>Fashion, Figure, Form.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Fashion,</HI> rises from labour, and, results from the workmanship; the workman, enriching it, more or less, according to his taste. <HI>Figure,</HI> springs from design, and, results from the out-lines of the thing; the author of the plan, making it, either more or less, regular, according to his abilities. <HI>Form,</HI> rises from construction, and, results, from the arrangement of parts; the conductor of the work, making it, more or less, natural, as his imagination di∣rects him.</P>
<P>The <HI>fashion</HI> of a work, frequently, ex∣ceeds in value, the price of the materials. We seldom give in architecture a round <HI>figure</HI> to any thing, except, to single pieces, and, such as stand by themselves. Paganism pictures the Deity, under all kinds
<PB N="209" REF="231"/>of <HI>forms;</HI> whereas, Christianity confines it to those, of a man, and, of a dove.</P>
<P>We say of <HI>fashion,</HI> that it is, either pret∣ty, or, ugly; of <HI>figure,</HI> that it is, either, agreeable, or, disagreeable; of <HI>form,</HI> that, it is, either, common, or, uncommon.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="201" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>201. <HI>Fault, Defect, Imperfection.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Fault,</HI> includes in its idea, a relation to the maker; so that, while it implies, some real want, in the finishing of the work, it denotes, also, that, it was owing to the workman. <HI>Defect,</HI> expresses something <HI>imperfect,</HI> in the thing, without any relation to the maker of it. <HI>Imperfection,</HI> intimates, something of less consequence, than is un∣derstood by the preceding words, and, is used, with more propriety, in morality, than, either, in physics, or, mechanics.</P>
<P>The smoaking of chimneys, is a great <HI>fault</HI> in houses; as, a little attention in the builder, may easily prevent it. When the beauty of a building is spoiled, for want of
<PB N="210" REF="232"/>room, or, proper materials, it is a <HI>defect,</HI> which the builder could not prevent. <HI>Im∣perfections,</HI> are considered by the bigotted religionist, as real sins; but, reasonable christians, look upon them, only, as the natural consequents of frail humanity.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="202" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>202. <HI>Fault, Crime.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Faults,</HI> result from human weakness; be∣ing transgressions of the rules of duty. <HI>Crimes,</HI> proceed from the wickedness of the heart; being actions, against the rules of nature.</P>
<P>The effects of anger, and, the intrigues of gallantry, are <HI>faults.</HI> Calumnies, and, assassinations, are <HI>crimes.</HI></P>
<P>It is our indispensable duty, to pardon <HI>faults;</HI> but, punish <HI>crimes.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="203" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>203. To <HI>Oblige, Constrain,</HI> To <HI>Compel, Force.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The last of these words, rises upon the third, as the third does, upon the second,
<PB N="211" REF="233"/>and, the second, upon the first; each of them, implying, an opposition to liberty. The word, <HI>oblige,</HI> relates more to duty, or, necessity; intimating, a power acting on us, in conformity to our inclinations: <HI>constrain,</HI> refers to those troublesome oppositions, that make us determine, against our incli∣nations; <HI>compel,</HI> alludes to power and au∣thority, which makes us act, in express contrariety to our will, which, we lament the not being master of: the word, <HI>force,</HI> implies, contrary efforts of a vigorous ac∣tion, which, we try to resist, but, in vain.</P>
<P>The duty of a child, to its parents, <HI>ob∣liges</HI> it, to assist him, in his old-age. The weaker and softer sex, is that, which can least brook <HI>constraint.</HI> There are, some, occa∣sions, on which we should not be sorry, to be <HI>compelled,</HI> even to that, we are most un∣willing to do. Ancient politeness of the table, went so far, as, to <HI>force</HI> guests to eat and drink.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="204" TYPE="part">
<PB N="212" REF="234"/>
<HEAD>204. <HI>Heaviness, Weight.</HI></HEAD>
<P>In the figurative sense, the difference of these words, is so extremely great, as to need no pointing out; in the literal, in∣deed, they are, often, confounded; con∣sidered then, in this last sense, <HI>heaviness,</HI> is that quality in a body, which we feel, and, distinguish by itself: <HI>weight,</HI> is the mea∣sure and degree of that quality, which we cannot ascertain, but, by comparison.</P>
<P>We say, absolutely, and, in an undeter∣mined sense, that a thing is <HI>heavy;</HI> but re∣latively, and, in a manner determined, that, it is of such a <HI>weight,</HI> for example, of two, three, or, four pounds.</P>
<P>A thousand circumstances, prove the <HI>heaviness</HI> of the air; and, the mercury, de∣termines its exact <HI>weight.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="205" TYPE="part">
<PB N="213" REF="235"/>
<HEAD>205. To <HI>Return, Surrender, Restore.</HI></HEAD>
<P>We are said, to <HI>return,</HI> what has been lent or given us: to <HI>surrender,</HI> what we have in pledge or charge: to <HI>restore,</HI> what we have taken or stolen.</P>
<P>We ought to <HI>return,</HI> punctually; to <HI>surrender,</HI> faithfully; and, to <HI>restore,</HI> wholly.</P>
<P>We borrow, with an intent to <HI>return;</HI> we take a thing in charge, with a view of <HI>surrendering</HI> it again; but, we seldom take, with a design to <HI>restore.</HI></P>
<P>Custom makes use of these words, on the following occasions; the first, with res∣pect to civility, favours, presents, or, testi∣monies of kindness: the second, with respect to what, we are entrusted with; honours, employs, or, offices, with which we are in∣vested: the third, with relation to things taken away, that have been our due. Thus, we <HI>return</HI> money, that has been lent us; presents, we have received; and, let∣ters, to a deserted sweet-heart: we <HI>surrender</HI>
<PB N="214" REF="236"/>a child, to its parents; the ribbon of an order, the staff of command, seals, and, dig∣nities to a prince; we <HI>restore,</HI> an accused person, when found innocent, to his estates and honours; and, a minor, to the posses∣sion of his effects, which have been held from him.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="206" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>206. <HI>Sincerity, Frankness, Plainness, Ingenuousness.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Sincerity,</HI> prevents our speaking, other∣wise, than we think; and, is a virtue. <HI>Frank∣ness,</HI> makes us speak, as we think; and, is a natural effect. <HI>Plainness,</HI> is, speaking, freely, what we think; and, springs, some∣times, from want of reflection. <HI>Ingenuous∣ness,</HI> makes us declare what we know; and, is, often, a folly.</P>
<P>A <HI>sincere</HI> man, will not deceive; a <HI>frank</HI> man, will not dissemble; a <HI>plain</HI> man, is not apt to flatter; an <HI>ingenuous</HI> man, knows not how to conceal any thing.</P>
<P><HI>Sincerity,</HI> is of great value, in the inter∣course of the heart. <HI>Frankness,</HI> facilitates
<PB N="215" REF="237"/>the commerce of the world. <HI>Plainness,</HI> is, often, considered, as a want of politeness. <HI>Ingenuousness,</HI> is, frequently, found to err, against prudence.</P>
<P>The <HI>sincere,</HI> are, always, esteemed. The <HI>frank,</HI> please all the world. The <HI>plain,</HI> sometimes, offend. The <HI>ingenuous,</HI> often, betray themselves.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="207" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>207. <HI>Experiment, Trial, Proof.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Experiment,</HI> relates, properly, to the truth of things; it determines, whether a thing is, or, is not; clearing up of doubt, and, dissipating ignorance. <HI>Trial,</HI> concerns, particularly, the use of things; judging, whether they are proper, or, not; it settles the matter, and, determines the will. <HI>Proof,</HI> has a greater relation to the quality of things; teaching us, whether they are good, or, bad, distinguishing the best, and, taking away any fear of being deceived.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="238"/>We make <HI>experiments,</HI> in order, to know; <HI>trials,</HI> to choose; and, <HI>proofs,</HI> to be, tho∣roughly, acquainted with.</P>
<P><HI>Experiments,</HI> confirm our opinions; be∣ing the root of knowledge. <HI>Trial,</HI> con∣ducts our taste; being the road to satisfac∣tion. <HI>Proof,</HI> removes our fears; and, is a remedy against error and imposture.</P>
