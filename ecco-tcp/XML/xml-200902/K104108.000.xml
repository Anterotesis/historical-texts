<SP>
<LG>
<L>IN ev'ry age, the trump of deathless fame</L>
<L>Proclaims the warrior's and the poet's name;</L>
<L>Painting and sculpture all the pow'rs combine,</L>
<L>And <HI>laurels</HI> deck the bard's and hero's shrine.</L>
<L>No further can the parallel extend,</L>
<L>The poet's honours on success depend;</L>
<L>While Fortune's frown can ne'er molest the brave,</L>
<L>Nor blast the laurel springing from his grave.</L>
<L>An equal wreath impartial Fame supplies,</L>
<L>To him who conquers, and to him who dies;</L>
<L>For British valor was displayed, not more</L>
<L>On Nile's proud flood, than Helder's barren shore!</L>
<L>The chance of war the bravest may control,</L>
<L>But leaves untouch'd the courage of the soul;</L>
<L>And England gives her heroes, ever dear!</L>
<L>The shout of triumph, or the starting tear.</L>
<L>Not so the Bard—with him success is all!</L>
<L>When Fortune frowns, his air-built castles fall:</L>
<L>But if she smiles, he sails with prosperous breeze,</L>
<L>Like the small Nautilus o'er Summer seas;</L>
<L>Whose little oars on ocean's bosom sweep,</L>
<L>Fearless of all the monsters of the deep.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<STAGE>(After a pause.)</STAGE>
<L>Oft at <HI>this Bar,</HI> our Author has been <HI>tried,</HI></L>
<L>Where English Judges take the pris'ner's side!</L>
<L>Guilty of faults no doubt he will appear,</L>
<L>But human errors find acquittal here—</L>
<L>Where e'en the friendless always meet support,</L>
<L>From honest Juries, and an upright Court.</L>
<L>Critics, who rule o'er politics and plays,</L>
<L>If you are adverse, vain the poet's lays!</L>
<L>"You, who with equal hands the balance hold,</L>
<L>"Whose just decision ne'er was bought or sold,</L>
<L>"But who to ev'ry candidate dispense</L>
<L>"His lot of humour, and his share of sense,"</L>
<L>Protect our Author on the coming day,</L>
<L>And though you damn the Prologue—spare the Play:</L>
<L>To your decree each Dramatist must bow,</L>
<L>Give but your aid, and that will "Speed the Plough!"</L>

<P>A SINGULAR situation this my old Dad has placed me in; brought me here to marry a woman of fashion and beauty, while I have been professing and I've a notion feeling the most ardent love for the pretty Susan Ashfield—Propriety says, take Miss Blandford—Love says, take Susan—Fashion says, take both—but would Susan consent to such an arrangement?—and if she refused, would I con∣sent to part with her?

<P>Oh no, Sir, I could not so soon venture into the <HI>beau monde,</HI> a stranger just arrived from Germany—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Handy, jun.</SPEAKER>
<P>The very reason—the most fashion∣able introduction possible! but I perceive, Sir, you have here imitated other German importations, and only restored to us our native excellence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I assure you, Sir, I am eager to seize my birth-right, the pure and envied immunities of an English woman!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Handy, jun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I trust, Madam, you will be patriot enough to agree with me, that a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a nation is poor, whose only wealth is importation—that therefore the humble native artist may ever hope to obtain from his countrymen those fostering smiles, without which genius must sicken and in∣dustry decay. But it requires no <HI>valet de place</HI> to conduct you through the purlieus of fashion, for now the way of the world is, for every one to pursue their own way, and following the fashion is differing as much as possible from the rest of your acquaintance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss B.</SPEAKER>
<P>But surely, Sir, there is some distin∣guishing feature by which the votaries of fashion are known?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Handy, jun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; but that varies extremely— sometimes fashionable celebrity depends on a high waist—sometimes on a low carriage—sometimes on high play, and sometimes on low breeding—last winter it rested solely on green peas!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
<SPEAKER>Miss B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Green peas!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Handy, jun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Green peas!—that Lady was the most enchanting who could bring the greatest quantity of green peas to her table at Christmas! the struggle was tremendous! Mrs. Rowley Powley had the best of it by five pecks and a half, but it having been unfortunately proved, that at her ball there was room to dance and eat conve∣niently—that n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lady received a black eye, and no coachman was killed, the thing was voted decent and comfortable, and scouted accordingly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is comfort then incompatible with fashion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Handy, jun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly!—Comfort in high life would be as preposterous as a lawyer's bag cram∣med with truth, or his wig decorated with coque∣licot ribbons! No—it is not comfort and selection that is sought, but numbers and confusion! So that a fashionable party resembles Smithfield market, only a good one when plentifully stocked—and ladies are reckoned by the score like sheep, and their husbands by droves like horned cattle!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha! and the conversation—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Handy, jun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! like the assembly—confused, vapid, and abundant; as <Q>How do, Ma'am!—no accident at the door?—he, he!</Q>—<Q>Only my carriage broke to pieces!</Q>—<Q>I hope you had not your pocket picked!</Q>—<Q>Won't you sit down to faro?</Q>—"Have you many to-night?" —"A few, about six hundred!"—<Q>Were you at Lady Overall's?</Q>—<Q>Oh yes; a delicious crowd and plenty of peas, he, he!</Q>—and thus runs the fashionable race.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Abel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; and a precious run it is—full gallop all the way: first they run on—then their fortune is run through—then bills are run up—
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>then they are run hard—then they've a run of luck —then they run out, and then they run away!— But I'll forgive fashion all it's follies in considera∣tion of one of its blessed laws.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Yes; I'll do her the justice to say she encourages trade.—Why, do you know, Bob, my best coal-pit won't find her in white muslins—round her neck hangs a hundred acres at least; my noblest oaks have made wigs for her; my fat oxen have dwindled into Dutch pugs, and white mice; my India bonds are transmuted into shawls and otto of roses; and a magnificent mansion has shrunk into a diamond snuff-box.</P>

<P>No; I can't condescend.</P>

<P>Still Henry! Oh! some rustic boy. My dear child, you talk as if you loved this Henry.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, papa; for when he touched my hand, he trembled as if I terrified him; and in∣stead of looking at me as you do, who I am sure love me, when our eyes met, he withdrew his and cast them on the ground.</P>
</SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, papa.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Philip.</SPEAKER>
<P>And probably you could adduce proof equally convincing that you don't love him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh yes—quite; for in the dance he sometimes paid attention to other young women, and I was so angry with him! Now, you know, papa, I love you—and I am sure I should not have been angry with you, had you done so.</P>

<P>Oh! now I am certain I am not in love; for I feel no rankling at my heart. I feel the softest, sweetest sensation I ever experienced. But, papa, you must come to the lawn. I don't-know why, but to-day Nature seems enchanting; the birds sing more sweetly, and the flowers give more perfume.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Philip.</SPEAKER>
<P>When I left my native country, I lest it with a heart lacerated by every wound that the falsehood of others or my own conscience could inflict. Hateful to myself, I became the victim of dissipation—I rushed to the gaming table, and soon became the dupe of villains.—My ample fortune
<PB N="51" REF="50"/>was lost; I detected one in the act of sraud, and having brought him to my feet, he confessed a plan had been laid for my ruin; that he was but an humble instrument; for that the man who, by his superior genius, stood posseffed of all the mortgages and securities I had given, was one Mortington.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard your name him before. Did you not know this Morrington?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Philip.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; he, like his deeds, avoided the light—Ever dark, subtle, and mysterious. Col∣lecting the scattered remnant of my fortune, I wan∣dered wretched and desolare, till, in a peaceful village, I first beheld thy mother, humble in birth, but exalted in virtue. The morning after our marriage she received a packet, containing these words: <Q>The reward of virtuous love, presented by a repentant villain;</Q> and which also contained bills and notes to the high amount of ten thousand pounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss B.</SPEAKER>
<P>And no name?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Philip.</SPEAKER>
<P>None; nor could I ever guess at the generous donor. I need not tell thee what my heart suffered when death deprived me of her. Thus circumstanced, this good man, Sir Abel Handy, proposed to unite our families by mar∣riage; and in consideration of what he termed the honor of our alliance, agreed to pay off every in∣cumbrance on my estates, and settle them as a portion on you and his son. Yet still another wonder remains.—When I arrive, I find no claim whatever has been made, either by Morrington or his agents. What am I to think? Can Mor∣rington have perished, and with him his large claims to my property? Or, does he withhold the blow, to make it fall more heavily?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>SUSAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I FEAR my conduct is very imprudent.—Has not Mr. Handy told me he is engaged to another? But 'tis hard for the heart to forego, without one struggle, its only hope of happiness; and conscious of my own honor, what have I to fear? Perhaps he may repent his unkindness to me—at least I'll put his passion to the proof; if he be worthy of my love, happiness is for ever mine; if not, I'll tear him from my breast, tho' from the wound my life's blood should follow. Ah, he comes—I feel I am a coward, and my poor alarmed heart trem∣bles at its approaching trial—pardon me, female delicacy, if for a moment, I seem to pass thy sacred limits.</P>

<P>By Heavens, the misfortunes of Sir Philip Blandford weigh so heavily on my spirits, that —but confusion to melancholy! I am come here to meet an angel, who will, in a moment, drive away the blue devils like mist before the sun. Let me again read the dear words; <STAGE>(reading a letter)</STAGE><Q>I confess I love you still,</Q><STAGE>(kisses the letter)</STAGE> but I dare not believe their truth till her sweet lips con∣firm it. Ah, she's there—Susan, my angel! a thousand thanks. A life of love can alone repay the joy your letter gave me.</P>

<SPEAKER>Susan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you not despise me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Handy, jun.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; love you more than ever.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Susan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Robert, this is the very crisis of my fate.—From this moment we meet with honor, or we meet no more. If we must part, perhaps when you lead your happy bribe to church, you may stumble over your Susan's grave. Well, be it so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Handy, jun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Away with such sombre thoughts!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Susan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tell me my doom—yet hold—you are wild, impetuous—you do not give your heart fair play—therefore promise me (perhaps 'tis the last favor I shall ask), that before you determine whe∣ther our love shall die or live with honour, you will remain here alone a few moments, and that you will give those moments to reflection.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Handy, jun.</SPEAKER>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Handy, jun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I will reflect—that I am the most fortunate fellow in England. She loves me still—
<PB N="77" REF="76"/>what is the consequence? that love will triumph—that she will be mine—mine without the degrada∣tion of marriage—love, pride, all gratified—how I shall be envied, when I triumphantly pass the circles of sashion! one will cry, <Q>Who is that angel?</Q> another, "Happy fellow!" then Susan will smile around—will she smile? oh yes—she will be all gaiety—mingle with the votaries of pleasure, and—what! Susan Ashfield, the companion of licentious women! Damnation! no; I wrong her —she would not—she would rather shun society— she would be melancholy—melancholy, <STAGE>(sighs and looks at his watch)</STAGE> would the time were over. Pshaw! I think of it too seriously—'tis false—I do not—should her virtue yield to love, would not remorse affect her health? should I not behold that lovely form sicken and decay—perhaps die—die! then what am I? a villain—loaded with her parent's curses and my own. Let me fly from the dreadful thought—But how fly from it— <STAGE>(calmly)</STAGE> by placing before my imagination a picture of more honourable lineaments—I make her my wife. Ah! then she would smile on me—there's rapture in the thought —instead of vice producing decay, I behold virtue emblazening beauty—instead of Susan on the bed of death, I behold her giving to my hopes a dear pledge of our mutual love. She places it in my arms—down her father's honest face runs &amp; tear, but 'tis the tear of joy. Oh, this will be luxury— paradise!—Come, Susan—come, my love, my soul, my <HI>wife!</HI></P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Handy, jun.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Susan! how true it is, that fools alone are vicious. But let us fly to my father, and obtain his consent. On recollection, that may not be quite so easy. His arrangements with Sir Philip Blandford are—are—not mine, so there's an end of that. And Sir Philip, by missortune, knows how to appreciate happiness.

<SP>
<LG>
<L>So here I am—once more to bear a bob,</L>
<L>And for our Author do a friendly job;</L>
<L>Perhaps you don't know how to clap a Play;</L>
<L>Mind me—hand rattle hand—thus <STAGE>(claps his hands)</STAGE>—that's the way!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No doubt you think, though second sure to none,</L>
<L>I'm rather sanguine about number <HI>One;</HI></L>
<L>Ask all the world, who everything would try,</L>
<L>And all the world will answer, I! I! I!</L>
<L>Your sprightly Damsels seeking active fame,</L>
<L>Will rival schoolboys in each schoolboy game;</L>
<L>Give 'em but rope enough, they'll shine in skipping!</L>
<L>While many a lucky rogue may catch them tripping:</L>
<L>Others, with beauteous arm and lovely shoulder,</L>
<L>Conspicuous to each accurate beholder,</L>
<L>Vaulting on toe, with tamborine and bells,</L>
<L>Surpass the heroines of—Sadler's Wells!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor less our Beaux excite our admiration;</L>
<L>Their shoulders too are worthy observation;</L>
<L>Not bare indeed, but cas'd in tenfold stuffing—</L>
<L>They need not, if they like not, feel a cuffing;</L>
<L>Nay what's more frequent, and preserves as much,</L>
<L>They save the pressure of a Bailiff's touch.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Stuffing's a charm attracts us every minute;</L>
<L>E'en female bosoms find protection in it;</L>
<L>Expos'd to open charms and powerful flattery,</L>
<L>Why not gain conquests by a well-mask'd battery?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But truce to satire—Folly's lost in doubt,</L>
<L>And this age enters e'er that age goes out:</L>
<L><PB N="94" REF="93"/>
None know, so none to blame can find pretext,</L>
<L>Whether we sin last century or the next.</L>
<L>"You're a base man!" cries wealthy Madam Dump,</L>
<L>To her fond spouse who took her by the lump,</L>
<L>"To hide a wench last week behind the screen!"</L>
<L>"Last week, my love!—last <HI>Century</HI> you mean."</L>
<L>"Sure! says Miss Lydia Lank, an ancient maid,</L>
<L>"You will not countenance that painted jade:</L>
<L>"I hate to name the odious word <HI>miscarried;</HI></L>
<L>"And yet the wanton minx was never married!"</L>
<L>"That's an old story!"—"Old! two months or so."</L>
<L>"Two months! you dream! a <HI>Century</HI> ago!"</L>
<L>"Dam'me!" cries Dash, "each age has its beginning!"</L>
<L>His chin quite buried in five rounds of linen;</L>
<L>"Think you we drive through life with too much haste?</L>
<L>"'Tis neck or nothing with us lads of taste!"</L>
<L>"Your taste!" cries Dad; "I fear your credit shocks,</L>
<L>"The rise of <HI>Cravats</HI> proves the fall of <HI>Stocks:</HI></L>
<L>"Save then to-day, to-morrow we'll want some."</L>
<L>"To-morrow, Squaretoes! That's an <HI>Age</HI> to come!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Since then from changeful Time's uncertain state,</L>
<L>Our very foibles now are out of date;</L>
<L>Let the Bard's faults find shelter on the Stage,</L>
<L>And let his labours live at least an age.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Chear with your smiles the Poet's growing joy—</L>
<L>A scanty harvest must his hopes destroy;</L>
<L>To brighten future prospects, all should now,</L>
<L>With heart and hand unite to—Speed the Plough!</L>
