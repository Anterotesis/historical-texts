<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Paul preach∣ing at Athens.</HEAD>
<P>WHilst Paul was at Athens, he saw
<PB N="18" REF="16"/>
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>PAUL at ATHENS.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="19" REF="17"/>the city wholly given to idolatry: for which rea∣son he not only preached in the synagogue to the Jews and proselytes; but in other places of con∣course he took occasion to make known the Christian doctrine to all the heathens he met.</P>
<P>Some learned men of Athens seeing Paul so rea∣dy to engage in dispute with every one, undertook
<PB N="20" REF="18"/>him: but not understand∣ing him, some cried, he was a prating, babbling fellow; others, that he came to discover some strange God to them, be∣cause he frequently men∣tioned Jesus and the resur∣rection.</P>
<P>After this they brought him before the magistrates, to be examined what new religion it was he taught: for all that they had hi∣therto
<PB N="21" REF="19"/>heard was new and strange, and therefore they desired to have a full ac∣count of all. Paul being at full liberty to speak, said, — 'I perceive, O Athenians, that ye have a great number of idols; for as I passed by and saw your superstitious devo∣tions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. This GOD therefore,
<PB N="22" REF="20"/>whom you acknowledge not to know, yet profess to worship, is he whom I preach, the invisible God of heaven and earth, who cannot be contained in temples of man's making; nor can any image made by man be a proper object of his worship; he being so far from wanting our help, that it is he that gives to all their life and all that they have: And from one
<PB N="23" REF="21"/>man he hath made a whole world of men, appointing times and places in great order. And the end of all this is, that they should seek after their Creator and worship him, who is in∣deed near every one of us, even as the Soul that ani∣mates us.</P>
<P>For our life, motion, and subsistance are wholly thro' him, according to that which one of your own poets hath said.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="22"/>God therefore being our Creator, we cannot in rea∣son suppose him to be the work of our hands, such as a piece of gold, silver, or a stone graved. This time of ignorance hath lasted long; but now God calls you are to repentance, hav∣ing determined the way by which all the world shall be judged; that is, by receiving or refusing the faith of Christ; who
<PB N="25" REF="23"/>being rais'd from the dead, is offered to all men to be∣lieve in.'</P>
<P>When they heard him mention the resurrection, the Epicureans especially, who denied a future state, fell a laughing at him; others said, we will hear thee about this another time: and so Paul left them.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> The conjuring books burnt.</HEAD>
<P>SOme of the vagabond Jewish exorcists see∣ing the many extraordina∣ry miracles which were wrought by the hand of Paul, insomuch that he did not only cure them who came to him, but by his touching linen clothes, and sending them to such
<PB N="28" REF="26"/>as were sick, or possessed with devils, they were immediately healed: The exorcists, I say, seeing this, they also attempted to cast out devils by using the name of JESUS; among whom were the seven sons of one Scaeva a Jew, one of the chief of the families of the priests, who adjur∣ing the evil spirit in the name of Jesus, were thus answered by the possessed,
<PB N="29" REF="27"/>'<HI>Jesus I know, and Paul I know;</HI> but you come not with any authority from Jesus, who hath given it to Paul.'</P>
<P>And the man who was possessed fell furiously up∣on them, and was too hard for them; tearing off their clothes, and wounding them, so that they were glad to sly from him.</P>
<P>This being soon rumour∣ed among the Jews and
<PB N="30" REF="28"/>natives of Ephesus, pre∣vailed so with them, that they were convinced, and converted to the faith.</P>
<P>And they that were so happy came to Paul and his company, confessing their former course of life, to know what they should do: And many that had studied and practised ma∣gick, brought their books out, and burnt them pub∣lickly, tho' they were of
<PB N="31" REF="29"/>a very high price. Of so great authority was the word of God, as it was preached by Paul among the Ephesians and those of Asia.</P>

<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="33" REF="31"/>
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> King Agrippa almost per∣suaded to be a Christian.</HEAD>
<P>PAUL having been brought before king Agrippa to answer to di∣vers complaints made a∣gainst him by the Jews in general, as a most notori∣ous malefactor; and after Festus, a noble orator, had open'd his case in an ele∣gant
<PB N="34" REF="32"/>speech before the court; Agrippa told Paul he had liberty to speak: who desiring silence of the audience, began with this apology for himself:</P>
<P>'I cannot but think my self happy, O king Agrip∣pa, in that I am permitted to make my defence a∣gainst the accusation laid by the Jews before your Majesty, whom I know to be a perfect master of the
<PB N="35" REF="33"/>Jewish laws and customs: for which reason I beg your patience.</P>
<P>He then acquaints the king with the manner of his life from his youth; of his being bred a Pharisee, of his being accused for asserting the resurrection of the dead; appeals to him why it should be thought a thing incredi∣ble, that God, who is omnipotent, should raise
<PB N="36" REF="34"/>the dead. Confesses his own former unbelief; the havock that he made amongst the church; his extraordinary conversion; and many other things, re∣lating both to himself and to the gospel of Jesus Christ. And at last asked king Agrippa this ques∣tion; '<HI>Believest thou the prophets, O king?</HI> I am satisfied thou dost; and knowest their predictions to be fulfilled.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="35"/>This was so home a challenge to Agrippa, that in the publick presence he declared, that Paul had al∣most persuaded him to be a Christian.</P>
<P>Upon this the assembly broke up: And when Agrippa and Feslus had consulted together about Paul's case, they freely owned that the accusation laid against him was not punishable by death or im∣prisonment.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Paul's voyage, and ship∣wreck on the island of Milita, or Malta.</HEAD>
<P>PAUL having appealed unto Caesar, and an opportunity offering, Fes∣tus sends him to Rome,
<PB N="39" REF="37"/>
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>St. Paul's Shipwreck.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="40" REF="38"/>under a guard commanded by one Julius, in a ship belonging to a sea port of Mysia; in which they set sail, and coasted along Asia till they arrived at Sidon; where Julius, who treated Paul very respectfully, gave him leave to go ashore and resresh himself.</P>
<P>Sailing from thence, they came in fight of the sland of Cyprus, where they were to lie by a
<PB N="41" REF="39"/>while; but the winds pre∣senting, they passed the seas of Cilicia and Pam∣phylia, and came to Mira, a maritime city of Lycia. Here Julius finding a large ship bound for Italy, took his prisoners on board her, and with much ado made Salome, a city of Crete: from whence, after they had been long beating at sea with contrary winds, and very stormy weather,
<PB N="42" REF="40"/>they arrived at Fair-ha∣vens, near Lasca; where Paul would have persuad∣ed captain Julius to wait for more seasonable wea∣ther: but he preferring the master of the ship's judgment, they put to sea, intending to reach Phoe∣nice, a harbour of Creto, where there was safe rid∣ing, and there to winter; and they having a light gale of south, they ques∣tioned
<PB N="43" REF="41"/>not in the least of gaining their point.</P>
<P>But they soon found themselves mistaken; for the wind suddenly tacking about, blew so very hard at north east; that they were forced to hand all their sails, and let her drive before the wind. And coming under a little island called Clauda, they had like to have lost their boat; but with much ado
<PB N="44" REF="42"/>recovering it, they hoisted it into the ship.</P>
<P>The next day, the storm continuing, they were forced to cut away their masts, and throw all their tackle overboard, and ligh∣ten their ship. The storm still increasing, and neither sun nor stars for many days appearing, they gave them∣selves over for lost.</P>
<P>Which Paul perceiving, he told them that he had
<PB N="45" REF="43"/>seen a vision, which assur∣ed him that not a soul of them should be lost, tho' the ship should.</P>
<P>The ship thus driving for fourteen days at the mercy of the winds and waves, about midnight the sailors fansied they were near land; and throwing the lead, they sounded, and found it twenty fa∣thoms, then fifteen, and it still shaling, and being
<PB N="46" REF="44"/>night, they apprehended they might strike upon some shelves in the dark, so they let go four anchors astern, and waited for day.</P>
<P>And now the seamen resolving to shift for them∣selves, had hoisted the boat overboard, under pretence of mooring the ship ahead as they had done astern: but Paul perceiving their design, told captain Julius, that if the sailors were suf∣fered
<PB N="47" REF="45"/>to quit the ship, they should be in danger of be∣ing all lost. Upon this the soldiers, to prevent their design, cut the ropes, and let the boat go adrift.</P>
<P>Now Paul persuades them on board to take some refreshment. The number of all that were in the ship was two hundred seventy six, including sol∣diers and passengers.</P>
<P>In the space between
<PB N="48" REF="46"/>that and day-break, they all eat and drank, and were refreshed; having had no leisure or thought of eat∣ing for a considerable time before. After this refresh∣ment they sell chearfully to work, unloading the ship not only of goods but of the provisions, and throwing them into the sea.</P>
<P>When it was day, they discovered a creak and a
<PB N="49" REF="47"/>haven, into which they endeavoured to put; and when they had weighed the anchors, they made to the shore, and run the ship aground, where she soon bulg'd. The captain then ordered the prisoners that could swim to throw themselves into the sea first; and the rest on bro∣ken pieces got safe to land: where when they were all arrived, they knew the
<PB N="50" REF="48"/>place to be the island Me∣lita, or. Malta.</P>
<P>The islanders seeing them in distress, treated them with great humani∣ty; making fires to warm their wet and weary limbs. But whilst they were dry∣ing and warming them∣selves, a viper, driven from her hole by the heat of the fire, leaped out and fasten∣ed upon Paul's hand: which when the natives,
<PB N="51" REF="49"/>saw, they concluded him guilty of murder, and that divine vengeance had pur∣sued him to that place, to die by the bite of this ve∣nomous creature: but he shook it off into the fire, and felt no harm. On seeing this, they present∣ly alter'd their opinion, and concluded him a God.</P>
<P>The latter part of this history, is the subject of the eighth and last piece of painting.</P>

<PB N="52" REF="50"/>
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Of the Library, the Model of St. Peter's at Rome, the great Bell, and geo∣metrical Staircase.</HEAD>
<P>HAving quitted the whispering gallery, you are next invited to see the above curiosities; for which favour <HI>each persen pays Two-pence.</HI></P>
<P>The Library room is
<PB N="53" REF="51"/>large and beautiful; the wainscoting, carvings, shelves, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> are of nice workmanship; but not∣withstanding there is a large collection of books in it the shelves appear ve∣ry thin, and those lock'd up in a profound silence; some lolling fast asleep one way, and some another.</P>
<P>These books were de∣signed for the use of the clergy belonging to the
<PB N="54" REF="52"/>cathedral: but what from the height of its situation, which is half way up the cupola; and the dulness of its company, consisting mosily of a parcel of anti∣quated, must, crabbed old authors; makes it very seldom visited by them. Their chief use now is to be made a publick shew of (like so many monsters) to strangers, country peo∣ple, and little masters and
<PB N="55" REF="53"/>misses; who, whenever they come to see this fine Library, must always take care to go into the room on tiptoe, for fear of dis∣turbing any of these drou∣sy old gentlemen.</P>
<P>The floor of this room is very curious, being im∣laid, without peg or nail, with so much art and in∣genuity, that it really looks very beautiful.</P>
<P>There is also a fine pic∣ture
<PB N="56" REF="54"/>in it, of the right re∣verend Henry Compton, late lord bishop of London.</P>
<P><HI>The Model of St. Peter's at Rome.</HI></P>
<P>This was taken by Sir Christopher Wren from the church of St. Peter at Rome, whilst he resided there; and from this, with some alterations, our cathe∣dral of St. Paul was built:
<PB N="57" REF="55"/>he having took care to correct in the latter, what he saw a blemish in the former. This model stands in a large room, where those who are curious may examine it. 'Tis a fine piece, though now fallen somewhat to decay.</P>
<P>As to the great Bell and Clock, I have. spoke of them before in the first Volume, pag. 77. to which
<PB N="58" REF="56"/>I must refer my young readers; and shall only add, that the way to them is both dark and somewhat difficult to ascend, and therefore not advisable for my young readers to ven∣ture up, without a proper guide. Besides, should the clock happen to strike whilst they are in the bell lost, the sound is so sur∣prisingly loud and shock∣ing to those who are un∣accustomed
<PB N="59" REF="57"/>to it, that they would imagine it would rend the very tower all to pieces.</P>
<P>There is one thing more which is observable, that this clock is wound up once a day, which gene∣rally takes up an hour's time: and as 'tis then set, it is looked upon to be ve∣ry exact.</P>
<P>Lastly, You are shewn the grand Geometrical
<PB N="60" REF="58"/>Staircase; which is a cu∣rious and wonderful piece of workmanship, and so artfully contrived, that the support of the whole prin∣cipally depends on the foot-stone only. This, and the stone staircase at Hampton. court, are the only two of the kind that are to be met with in any of our publick buildings.</P>
<P>To give a more parti∣cular account of its beau∣ties,
<PB N="61" REF="59"/>would require the judgment of one who is conversant in the science, to which I must ingenu∣ously acknowledge my self a stranger.</P>
<P><HI>Next we shall proceed to the inside of the church.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of the inside of St. Paul's.</HEAD>
<P>THE pillars of the church that support the roof, are two ranges, with their entablature and beautiful arches, whereby the body of the church and choir are divided into
<PB N="63" REF="61"/>three isles. The roof of each is adorn'd with arch∣es, and spacious periphe∣ries of enrichments; as shields, leaves, chaplets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> admirably carved in stone.</P>
<P>At the west end of the church there are three doors which lead to the above isles; from each of which you have a beauti∣ful prospect the whole length of the church,
<PB N="64" REF="62"/>without any interception from the pillars, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Just within the door of the north isle, on the left hand, is the morning pray∣er chapel, where divine service is performed every day in the week, excepting Sundays: from Lady-day to Michaelmas, at six in the morning; and from Michaelmas to Lay-day, at seven.

<P>Next to the morning

<P>At the entrance of the south isle, on the right hand, is the door that leads to the geometrical staircase: Next to that is the bishop of London's spiritual court; which has

A little beyond this court, on the left hand, is a beautiful marble font; which for largeness, the fineness of its marble, and curious workmanship, ex∣cels all others; for which reason, I thought the pic∣ture of it would not be

<P>THis cathedral hath a Bishop, a Dean, a Precentor, Chancellor, Treasurer, and five Arch∣deacons; to wit, London, Middlesex, Essex, col∣chester, and St. Albans. It hath thirty Prebenda∣ries,
<PB N="76" REF="74"/>twelve Canons, and six Vicars choral.</P>
<P>The north and south sides of the choir have each thity stalls, besides the Bishop's throne and seat on the south side, and the Lord Mayor's on the north: all which compose one vast body of curious carved work of the finest wainscot, done by that ex∣cellent artist the late Mr. Gribeline Gibbon; as was
<PB N="77" REF="75"/>likewise all the other car∣ved work, both of the ehoir and church.</P>
<P>On the south side of the entrance into the choir is the dean's vestry; and near that the singing boys ves∣try; and on the noth side the residentiarys and sing∣ing mens vestry, where they all robe and unrobe.</P>
<P>There are four Vergers belonging to this church; so called from <HI>virga,</HI> a rod,
<PB N="78" REF="76"/>which each bears in his hand. The dean's has the cross daggers at top; the others have no ensign at all.</P>

<P>THE passage down to these vaults, is by a door in the body of the church.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="78"/>These vaults are indeed very spacious, but at the same time dark and gloo∣my, and strike a kind of horror in those who de∣scend, in order to survey the numerous and massy pillars and arches which support this prodigious pile of buildings; of which they may be able to form some idea, from the glim∣mering light that is intro∣duced into it from the
<PB N="81" REF="79"/>small windows that open into the church-yard.</P>
<P>However, this place is too solemn, melancholy and unpleasant, for our young readers to roam about in; neither indeed are they invited to see it, as they are the other curi∣osities belonging to the church: and therefore would advise them to be contented with this ac∣count of it, rather than

<HEAD>ST. FAITH'S CHURCH.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="83" REF="81"/>to gratify their curiosity by taking so gloomy a pro∣spect.</P>
<P>Under the choir there was formerly the parish church of St. Faith, com∣monly called, <HI>St. Faith's under St. Paul's;</HI> of which there is now no remains. There is indeed a spot of ground railed in, and set apart for the burial of the dead of that parish, which is still subsisting, and united
<PB N="84" REF="82"/>to that of St. Austin's.So that the notion which is entertain'd by several per∣sons, and by others confi∣dently asserted, that there is a parish church now be∣neath the choir; and that there are prayers and preaching still performed therein on some particular days, is vulgar error, and altogether groundless.</P>
<P>There are under the choir, in this dark reposi∣tory,
<PB N="85" REF="83"/>the monuments of several eminent persons; but as it would be too te∣dious to give a description of them all, and no ways entertaining to the young reader, we shall pass them over in silence, and take notice only of that of the Architect of this grand building, who lies interr'd in a little corner close to the foundation wall, on the south-east side, next Wat∣ling-street.
<PB N="86" REF="84"/>There is a plain stone fix'd against the wall at his head, with the following inscription in capitals:

<P>The purpot of which is this: <HI>Here lies the body of Christopher Wren, the Architect of this cathedral church, &amp;c. who lived a∣bove ninety years, and stu∣died the good of the pub∣lick, and not his own pri∣vate

<P>This inscription is much admired for the justness and simplicity of the thought.</P>

AN ACCOUNT Of the MONUMENT <HI>Of the Fire of London.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Its situation, description, and building.</HEAD>
<P>ON the east side of Fish-street-hill, near to the foot of London-bridge,
<PB N="92" REF="90"/>stands the Monu∣ment, in a square open to the street.</P>
<P>It was set up by order of parliament, in perpe∣tual memory of the dread∣ful fire that hapned the second day of <HI>September,</HI> 1666. within one hun∣dred and thirty feet of the house where the fire first broke out; and upon the spot where the church of St. Margernet's New-fish-street stood.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="91"/>This Monument stands upon an ascent from the street of three or four steps, upon a large vault of stone, arched.</P>
<P>The column is of the Dorick order, built all of excellent Portland stone. 'Tis erected upon a pede∣stal, or square of about twenty seven feet high: The body, or shaft of it is fluted; and is in height, from the pedestal to the
<PB N="94" REF="92"/>balcony, a hundred and thirty three feet; and from the balcony to the top of the flame, is thirty eight feet: And the height of the whole Monument from the ground, besides the vault and foundation, to the top of the flame, is two hundred and two feet; the circumference of the shaft forty seven feet and a half; its dia∣meter from without the
<PB N="95" REF="93"/>wall, fifteen feet; within∣side, nine feet diameter; the thickness of the stone wall of the shaft is three feet.</P>
<P>It hath three hundred and forty five steps, or stairs, from the ground up to the balcony; and niches in the wall with seats to rest in, as people go up: and from the balcony up∣wards is a ladder of iron steps to go into the urn;
<PB N="96" REF="94"/>out of which the flame, all gilt with godl, issueth; and to the stairs, having an open newel, there is a rail of iron to rest the hand upon all the way up.</P>
<P>This Monument is not unlike those two antient white marble pillars at Rome, erected in honour of the emperors Trajan and Antoninus, which were built above fifteen hundred years since; and
<PB N="97" REF="95"/>are still standing entire.</P>
<P>The whole of this Mo∣nument taken together is a curious piece of work∣manship: The charge of erecting it is said to a∣mount to thirteen thou∣sand seven hundred pounds and upwards.</P>
<P>This building loftily shews itself above the houses, and gives a gallant prospect for many miles round, to those that are
<PB N="98" REF="96"/>in the balcony; so that many people have the cu∣riosity to go up, and look about them from thence. The person appointed to keep it is allowed a salary for his attendance, besides the money people give him: The price demand∣ed is <HI>Twopence each person.</HI></P>
<P>It was begun in the may oralty of Sir Richard Ford, 1671. and finish'd in that of Sir Joseph Shel∣don, 1676.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of the careted figures in he west front.</HEAD>
<P>THE side towards the street hath a represen∣tation of the destruction of the city by the fire, and the rebuilding of it again, by several curiously engraven figures made in full proportion.</P>
<P>First is the figure of a
<PB N="102" REF="100"/>woman representing Lon∣don, sitting on ruins, in a most disconsolate posture, her head hanging down, and her hair all loose about her, the sword lying by her, and her left hand carelesly laid upon it. A second figure is Time with his wings and bald head, coming behind her, and gently lifting her up. Another female figure on the side of her, laying
<PB N="103" REF="101"/>her hand upon her, and with a scepter winged in her other hand, directing her to look upwards; for it points up to two beau∣tiful goddesses sitting in the clouds; one leaning on a cornucopia, denoting Plenty: the other having a palm-branch in her hand, signifying Victory or Triumph. Underneath this figure of London in the midst of the ruins is
<PB N="104" REF="102"/>a dragon with his paw upon the shield of a red cross, the arms of Lon∣don: Over her head are represented houses burn∣ing, and flames breaking out thro' the windows; behind her citizens look∣ing on, and some of them lifting up their hands.</P>
<P>Opposite to these figures is a pavement of stone, rais'd with three or four steps; on which appears
<PB N="105" REF="103"/>king Charles the second in a Roman habit, with a truncheon in his right hand, and a laurel about his head; coming towards the woman in the despair∣ing posture aforesaid; and giving orders to two or three others to descend the steps towards her. The firit hath wings on her head, and a crown of na∣ked boys dancing; and in her hand something re∣sembling
<PB N="106" REF="104"/>an harp. Then another figure of one go∣ing down the steps, fol∣lowing her, representing Architect; shewing a scheme, or model for re∣building the city, held in the right hand; and the lest holding a square and compasses. Behind these two stands another figure holding up an hat, denot∣ing Liberty. Next be∣hind the king is the duke
<PB N="107" REF="105"/>of York, holding a gar∣land ready to crown the rising city, and a sword lifted up in the other hand to desend her. Behind this a third figure, with and earl's coronet on his head. A fourth, behind all, hold∣ing a lion with a bridle in his mouth. Over these figures is represented an house in building, and a labourer going up a ladder with an hodd upon his
<PB N="108" REF="106"/>back. Lastly, underneath the stone pavement where∣on the king stands, is a good figure of envy, peeping forth, gnawing an heart.</P>
