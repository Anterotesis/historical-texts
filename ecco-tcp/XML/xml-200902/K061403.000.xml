<SP>
<L>In these dread times, when WAR's unsated rage</L>
<L>Crowds with disasters LIFE's eventful stage,</L>
<L>When the full trumpet and embattled ire</L>
<L>Drown the soft warblings of the slighted Lyre,</L>
<L>The MUSES' lonely haunts no more display,</L>
<L>Among their with'ring blooms, the POET's BAY</L>
<L>The partial soil, THE LAUREL only rears,</L>
<L>For martial wreaths, that <HI>vegetate in tears.</HI></L>
<L>At such a time, superfluous seems the art,</L>
<L>To melt with fabled woes the sadden'd heart;</L>
<L>The sorrowing MUSES need themselves relief,</L>
<L>And FANCY droops in sympathetic grief.</L>
<L>The TRAGIC MAID, indeed, may sooth her care,</L>
<L>And future scenes from passing ills prepare;</L>
<L>But for the LAUGHING NYMPH, alas! can she</L>
<L>At ease presume with her untimely glee!</L>
<L>Is there a place, amidst the world's alarms,</L>
<L>In safety still to heed her frolic charms?</L>
<L>Yes—in the shades of BRITAIN's happy Isle,</L>
<L>Still may the COMIC MUSE securely smile;</L>
<L>Still with her tuneful Sisters shelter here,</L>
<L>Nor savage ANARCHY's vain menace fear!</L>
<L>Here no DIRE RUFFIANS, dead to gen'rous joy,</L>
<L>All that endears and brightens life destroy;</L>
<L>Or, drench'd in blood, with impious rage combine,</L>
<L>Trampling o'er THRONES, to crush the HALLOW'D SHRINE!</L>
<L>No DESPOT here exacts a slavish awe,</L>
<L>The casual impulse of his passions LAW.</L>
<L>Here on a rock, secure amid the storm,</L>
<L>Dwells LIBERTY, in fair monarchic form.</L>
<L>Around her FAME, with venerable grace,</L>
<L>THREE MATCHLESS COLUMNS, fortify the place.</L>
<L>Enthron'd within, pre-eminently great,</L>
<L>Sits awful JUSTICE, in majestic slate,</L>
<L>Of LQUAL LAWS the animating soul,</L>
<L>And station'd HIGHEST, to survey THE WHOLE;</L>
<L>Her SWORD by MERCY check'd, as urg'd by MIGHT,</L>
<L>Her CROWN the SANCTION of a PEOPLE'S RIGHT.</L>

<P>AH, dame! so that Miss Louisa's room is dizen'd out, all the rest of the house may go at sixes and sevens!</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Husband! How crusty you've got with our lodger Miss Louisa, only because she's a lady, and you think she has a deal of money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Joll.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why to be sure her money did not do much mischief when it bought tidy warm cloathing for half the poor of our village, and the setting up the little school and paying you for teaching the children, as our rascally rich folks here refused to establish one; our gentry expect forsooth, 'cause I'm a miller, think I must cringe and sneak; but I'll never bow to the golden calf! People to get money stick at no villany or meanness, and then they're as saucy—Dame, I've been round the customers to gather in rent for my landlord Master Allbut. Here. <STAGE>(Takes out a bank-note.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ten pounds! I suppose its having so much money that's made you so saucy this morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Joll.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ecod, wife, I believe so. As I come up street cou'dn't tell what was the matter with me; met honest Dick the cobler—came out with his "good morrow, Master Jollyboy." I felt a sort of a—thought he might as well have said nothing. Tom the farrier gave me a friendly smack o' th' shoulder; I had a mind to knock him down
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>for his joke: then, now, coming into my own house, forgot to stoop, and bump'd my forehead against the top o' the door-case. Oh, ho! then it's the cash has done all this! I wish 'twas gone, for while I have it I feel I shall be as impudent as the devil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam Louisa, <STAGE>(looking out.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Joll.</SPEAKER>
<P>Doctor Grigthy with her! Tho' he's now our apothecary, and sets up also to be a wine-merchant, the lady wou'dn't be so proud of his company, did she know he was once our barber.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be quiet, husband. Doctor Grigsby is a fine man!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Joll.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, because when you were sick his bottles came in packets, till I tasted, and found all the while the doctor had been supplying you with cherry-brandy.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Louisa.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my kind good friend, <STAGE>(looking about.)</STAGE> Why how very handsome you've made my room look! how much I'm obliged to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Joll.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dr. Grigsby! I wou'dn't let him cure my cat of a tooth-ach. The fellow has made money out of peo∣ple's folly, and now don't know how to behave himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish you'd learn how to behave yourself; strutting about with your hat on, and a lady in the room.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Joll.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know nothing about ladies or gentlemen. That fellow was a good barber till money spoiled him—my hat! <STAGE>(takes it off)</STAGE>, my hat's here—and now it's there, <STAGE>(puts it on.)</STAGE> What signifies where a man's hat is? Hats and beads— ladies—gentlemen—good as another—hem!<STAGE>(siruts off muttering.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Plague take you for a fool!—as good-natur'd a man as ever broke bread, but when he gets these fancies in his noddle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where there is real worth these little oddities of humour rather excite pleasantry than resentment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Od, I'll give it him!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never mind now, my kind Margery—I'm sorry I must leave you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Leave us! Well, if I didn't expect my silly husband's behaviour wou'd bring it to this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hush! your husband has nothing to do in it:— I'm certain I can confide in you;—you know little of me;— I'm a stranger;—but I'll not trouble you with more of my affairs than just necessary. You doubtless concluded from
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>the trisling sums I expended on my first coming here into your village, that I must of course be some very rich body or other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>La, Ma'am, I didn't expect you for that!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe it. From certain family circum∣stances, immaterial to any but myself, I have been obliged to—however, you know I came from Ireland—have been in France, and—I am unfortunately not on the best terms with my friends, till a make up can be brought about to my wish. Not being over strong in purse, I plann'd a frugal retirement; the variety of calls upon the feelings of my heart have at length exhausted my little finance; therefore— but mind, I'm not cast down—no, I'm as happy—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear, I'm so sorry—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, if you go to pity me I shall be very much affronted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>I affront you!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord! I never was more gay or cheerful in my whole life: but I'll tell you—You know, you and your husband are very honest people, and get nothing but what you hardly earn; now, why should I from my extravagance become a burden to you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Extravagance! 'twas your charity—burden! your stay will be a blessing to us—pay us when you can, or never, <STAGE>(weeping.)</STAGE> Oh, my sweet lady!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, perhaps I mayn't leave your village. But yet, better some strange place—tho' who here knows me— <STAGE>(aside.)</STAGE> Margery, I've conceiv'd a thought to stay among you without inconvenience to any one; I think I cou'd be useful to your Mistress Allbut, here. From her character of a passion for literary amusements, she might, perhaps, afford me a situation to read, or translate French; transcribe her poetry, for I am told she has wrote a number of pretty things; or cou'd, upon occasion, dress up a cap for her—eh, Margery, cou'd you recommend me? You know you told me she sometimes reads her poems to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Eh—Well, I'll call on her, my lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, none of your lady's to me—I must soon unlady myself. Upon my honour I shall be exceeding angry if you are not even merry. There now, that's a dear good woman, <STAGE>(shakes hands cordially, and goes to a chest of drawers.)</STAGE></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Joll.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wife, if 'Squire Allbut's corn comes, tell 'em it must wait; for I've got first a bushel to grind for old Budget the tinker.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't talk to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Joll.</SPEAKER>
<P>Eh!—What have you found a pot of gold under an old wall?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, husband! this dear young lady our lodger—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Joll.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her distress!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Joll.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, if she's distress'd about any one's poverty, her hand knows the way to her pocket, a road it has so often gone upon like occasions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but I may as well put my hand into my pocket.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Joll.</SPEAKER>
<P>Deuce o' your riddles—What's the matter with with you and she?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you at last, she herself is really distress'd, and won't stay because she can't pay us.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[Exit melancholy.]</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Joll.</SPEAKER>
<P>Distress'd! Oh, dear!—one that was so ready to relieve every body else, now to want it herself. <STAGE>(Louisa advances, Jollyboy takes off his hat with great respect,)</STAGE> Madam, I'm sure I'm vastly concerned that any past conduct of mine shou'd have given you the least uneasiness. You've done us too much honour in coming under our roof; and if any improper freedoms of ours have given you offence, you have only to blame your own condescension. Madam, we are but ignorant people, and if we have fail'd in our respect, I humbly crave your pardon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then Margery has told him. This is an attempt at irony—Become the subject of ridicule! I thought I could endure poverty, but I was wrong— <STAGE>(aside.)</STAGE> Sir, it's not immediately in my power to discharge what I already owe you, but hope soon; for I can assure you it wou'd give me infinite pleasure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Joll.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wou'd it? then—tho' I go to jail for my own rent— <STAGE>(aside.)</STAGE> True, I forgot—Ma'am, this was left for you just now; 'twas inclos'd in a paper—thought at first 'twas for myself, so broke it open—I beg pardon—tho' there was nothing written in't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ten pounds! Who left it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Joll.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did ask, but can't find who.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then my circumstances are known! Is there such benevolence? However, how to appropriate this
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>doesn't want a consideration. Pray let me know what I'm indebted to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Joll.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I request—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Joll.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Madam, since here now have I given what I had to pay my own rent; 'twill grind my heart to apolgoise to Landlord Allbut—but I've set her heart at ease, and that's good amends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grig.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(without.)</STAGE> No: I want my chay; so put that hamper of wine, and take the med'cines round in the little cart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Joll.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, now you should look above this Master Grigsby—you don't know him—a fellow taken from sitting with numb'd fingers, wig-weaving, into a doctor's service, to brush his coat and frizzle his pate, picking up hard words from the apothecary's boys, marrying the housekeeper,— throwing her purloinings into a brandy vault and drug-shop (she poisoned herself in one of them,) and now, by jargon, smiles, lies, and cringes, has glided into the good graces of every family in the village—Oh, he's not dressed in his phy∣sical pomp! When he wants to shew his consequence, pops himself into one of the famous fine velvet and gold suits left him by his old master the physician.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>

<P>But, Sir, hadn't you best come back to shop?</P>

<SP>

<P>Doctor, the lady wishes you'd—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hush!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grig.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Madam, never deceive your doctor—but that is impossible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>For me to think of attempting a deception!— Upon my word, Doctor, you have the happiest mode of compliment—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grig.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Ma'am, the compliment I put in that mix∣ture was two grains, or, as we of the faculty write in our Latin proscriptions, dux graniorum, six scruples, or cater∣scrupolibus; and, Madam, I'll venture to assirm, that the whole material medicar does not furnish a cure of more efficacious efficasey, that is, when we talk of a case, razor∣case—hem! I mean the soul-case; the body being the case of the soul, as a bottle is of a bottle of old port; the wine being the spirit; and so we doctors wax the cork to pre∣vent evaporation or somentation; just as if a gentleman, to shave his chin, would lather his occiput; that is, what we of the faculty call the whole healing art—scammony, wild poppy, the sublimate of styptic water, anthelmintic wine, hicra picra, and the nervous system.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, you've certainly a prodigious deal of skill; but nature prevents me from opportunities of putting it in practice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grig.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, Miss, I have an immense deal of practice— so much—the fatigue—knocked up at all hours!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Doctor, you're such a fine midwife, 'twou'd comfort one's heart to be your customer; and so I told my husband t'other night!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grig.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm capital in the obstetric art and—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, now pray excuse me, I'm a little indisposed, and company is—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grig.</SPEAKER>
<P>If indisposed, Madam, what's better company than your doctor? For in your case, as we of the faculty say, no aliment so mucilaginous as sheep's head broth: some prefer buttermilk, and it is indeed as a lacteal lachry∣moligon;—for, Madam, when the disease proceeds from a viscid pituitous substance obstructing the vessels of the lungs, we of the faculty call it a spurious peripneumony; there∣fore ripe fruits roasted, bak'd, or boil'd, such as green∣goose, young parsneps, extract of saturn,—then we throw in the bark, and that is, my dear Madam, the—the— nervous system.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Doctor, Miss Louisa wants a little rest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grig.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha! that's very well—then I know no∣thing of what a lady wants. I see she likes me by her wishes to turn me out. <STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE>—But, Madam, to pro∣mote an emulsive dormitory, or, as Celsus says, a nice bit of sleep or rest, nothing equal to a simple goss lettice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank ye, Doctor; but I don't need sopo∣risics.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grig.</SPEAKER>
<P>Soap! Dem this barber! how all my patients will be slapping suds in my teeth—but she must be some great heiress here incog. by her having dispersed so much money through the village, <STAGE>(aside.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I wish you a good morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grig.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rest! the nurse of disease! You see, as a doctor, I speak against my own interest. Nothing but exercise and open air can brace and strengthen the animal functions when the caninus rabies, or dog-madness, which we of the faculty call vertigo of the foot, comes—the—the—and that is, Madam, the nervous system. Do me the honour of taking an airing in my chaise; you may trust to my whip∣hand,—steady as if touching a vein—I'll drive you—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Joll.</SPEAKER>
<P>No: but I'll drive you out of my house, if you stay to—Don't you see that you've already bother'd the lady with your damn'd nonsense?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grig.</SPEAKER>
<P>I've what? Oh, this is pretty! What's that you said I did to her?</P>
</SP>

<P>Poh! Go along.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grig.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go along! Very well, that! Do you know, man, when you talk to a physician—Madam, my chaise is at the door—permit me the honour of whipping you round the circuitous circle in the grand tour of Esher, Weston Green, Molesey, Hampton Court, Bushy Park, and Ditton Marsh—the sight of so fine a dress'd lady as you sitting by my side—no other barber—hem! wine merchant—phy∣sician—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Doctor, your politness comes particularly ac∣ceptable, for I should like a little excursion, and I assure you my purse now cannot afford the expence of post-chaises —Well, Margery, you'll speak—Come, Doctor, now for your whip-hand.</P>

<P>Why 'twas Mamma herself.

<P>No, my Love, he's no more a brother. His late acquisition of a baronet's title, which he never expected, has rais'd him so much above me, that I'm now out of sight—every spark of fraternal affection; even compassion for my sufferings has been long extinguished!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Madam, I'm out of all patience with him— his family pride, so provokingly unreasonable—to take such a vast alarm at your marrying a tradesman, when he himself, tho' a baronet, is still in business—your husband was a brewer —your proud brother is a banker—and where the end is money, I can't see any great difference in the means us'd to acquire it.</P>

Aye, now I'm brisk—but when I'm flat—dead—you'll be for marrying some flashy young gentleman.</P>

<P>Farewell, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>What must have become of me but for you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, now, indeed—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>If heav'n has a store for the benevolent, your comforts will be many. You nor your's were never obliged to me—you owe nothing, but give all. Your conduct, contrasted with the ungrateful possessors of this house—for they have shared my bounty—they rose high upon my ruins, tho' now they will not know me. When we'd win the heart by increase of favours, each added obligation but ren∣ders the claim of benevolence more insupportable; and, though a kind wish is the only return expected, pride often quits the debt by an ungenerous endeavour to disown it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Madam, be cheerful—the Allbuts are un∣worthy of your resentment: their repeated cruelties to my father and me cancel what they compliment by the name of charity—we must bear. If my father receives any news from abroad, you shall hear—and you'll do the same by us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye; was my William returned—the letters you have received from Charles, tho' long back, never once mention him.</P>

<P>Be assur'd, Madam, William is still here, <STAGE>(points to her breast;)</STAGE> but why should I flatter myself he has yet a heart for me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>If he lives, dear Maria, could his gen'rous, his faithful heart make a reparation for past injuries! Per∣haps in my boy's honest affection you may forget the un∣kindness of his mother—Ch; that I could atone!—in that sweet hope, his return will give me the first delight—Well, well—</P>

<P>Come, all will be well. If I can slip out, I'll bring you some newspapers—they'll amuse you.</P>

<P>Very well, I'm oblig'd to you. Mamma, you staid so long, I fear'd Mr. Allbut had affronted you, and I'd have ask'd him what he meant by it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, that's very valiant of you, Edward—but t'other day, when Master Jack affronted you, you cry'd and walk'd away.</P>
</SP>

<P>Aye, I didn't mind for myself, 'cause Master Jack was able to beat three of me; but I wou'dn't suffer the biggest man in England to affront my mother.</P>

<P>Sir; will you be a friend to my son?</P>

<P>Ay, Madam; and I hope I can be a friend to him: for our family estate and title descend only in the mate line; to be sure my elder brother's wife, the Lady Castle∣Somers was just brought to bed; but I left Ireland in such a hurry, that I don't know this moment, whether I am an aunt or an uncle.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>You're very good, Sir Henry.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir—Miss Louisa Somners. Madam—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Sir Henry, I could have introduc'd this gen∣tleman to you. We have met before—hav'n't we, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>To my infinite pleasure, Madam. <STAGE>(Bows.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, this is very well—then, since you're already acquainted, I hope a similarity of sentiments will save me even a wish for a more tender intercourse between two such amiable persons. <STAGE>(Going.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, Sir Henry, pray don't go.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, didn't I promise to find a very unexpected friend for you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>True—to oblige me, won't you excuse Sir Henry? <STAGE>(To Charles.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Self-interest, Madam, when the cause leaves me with a lady I so much admire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir H.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(apart to Charles.)</STAGE>
<P>Follow that, Mr. Willows— niece to an srish peer—a desirable alliance! When your sister Maria gives her hand to my nephew, our family will be very leading in both kingdoms.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>(Sir Henry <HI>and</HI> Charles <HI>confer.)</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>This Mr. Bellevue's experiment to prove his friend was well enough; but his conduct to his mother and this young lady is very equivocal—leaves one in a cottage, and breaks a solemn engagement to the other. <STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Most obedient.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I wish'd for an occasion to talk to you a little, and you shall not again send me out of the way. <STAGE>(mimicks.)</STAGE> "Ma'am, I beg your pardon, I must speak to this lady"— and the poor savour'd—this lady, soon follows me in a shower of piteous tears—don't be offended; but I must inquire— What reason had you to break off that match?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then she has heard of my sister Maria and — <STAGE>(aside.)</STAGE> Madam, 'twas disproportionate—a very vulgar connection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="69" REF="72"/>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(aside.)</STAGE> True; I heard she was servant to Mrs. Allbut, but I thought her a very elegant woman tho'.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, she reflected a disgrace upon me; I'd wish to have conceal'd it from you; but since it's notorious, her partiality for the barber surgeon here—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, then you're jealous of Dr. Grigsby.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Jealous, Madam!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now I've done that pretty well, I'll question him on his treatment to his poor mother. <STAGE>(aside.)</STAGE> Sir, you've acquir'd a fortune abroad—don't you blush not to take a lit∣tle more notice of your honour'd parent?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, I have taken every notice that obedience and duty can dictate—my honoured parent shall never want an easy chair and a cheerful bottle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, this is a horrid man!—he'd insinuate—Sir, no aspersion can injure Mrs. Bellevue in my opinion; and I'm sorry that your conduct has turn'd it so very much against her son—but a child's protection the parent shall never miss whilst. I can prove myself the friend and comforter of aged benevolerce.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very odd this! What can she mean—what conduct of <HI>mine</HI> cou'd change her opinion of <HI>William Bellevue?</HI>— Why angry that my old father shou'd have an easy chair and a bottle—but the sweet character of her charity prepar'd my heart for the impression made by her beauty. As Sir Henry observes—if I cou'd obtain her with all my wealth, a respec∣table introduction into life is an object—but my sister and this Grigsby! no! she shall have Sir Henry's nephew— a splendid thing! her affections are alienated from William, so I don't injure him.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> William.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why 'tis he—so dress'd! the report's then true of my dear Charles—I give you joy, though your motive for concealing your success from me—but answer me; do you know of your sister's change?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, William! let her go—she's not worthy of such an honest fellow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then she has your approbation of her perfidy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(aside.)</STAGE> Call me to an account! this is rather build∣ing too much upon our former intimacy. I shou'd despise myself if pride of riches, or hope of more honourable alli∣ance, cou'd warp my heart from an old friend—yet—look'ye, Sir—</P>

<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir!</P>

<SP>
<PB N="70" REF="73"/>

<P>Your marrying my sister is now out of sight; but to atone for her perfidy, as you indeed justly call it, and in consideration of our former acquaintance—</P>

<P>Acquaintance! <STAGE>(much hurt.)</STAGE></P>

<P>Then Char les retaliates upon you my former endeavours to separate you from his sister—unkind at such a time! but what I've just heard is a treasure of triumph!— Sir, was not the vessel that brought your wealth to Europe captur'd at sea?—And but for the intrepidity of one brave young man, might you not, at this moment, be as much the wretched object of scorn, as you now <HI>suppose</HI> my son?—Be∣hold the preserver of your fortune!</P>

<P>This morning I walk'd about here, and did n't know where to break my fast.—If he gives me a bit of an estate, I'll build such a country house! the sign, my family arms, and my motto—walk in and eat, all that want a dinner! Ah, child! there's only one thing more you cou'd do, to make me happier—here's the neat boy, that cut and slash'd your dear Father about—that stood upon the deck, shaking the bullets out of his hair like a mermaid.—With your leave, Madam; <STAGE>(to Mrs. Bellevue.)</STAGE> Louisa, take from my hand William Bellevue.</P>

<P>And me to retract my ill opinion of a good man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear William, by a look back to our past adven∣tures, you'll enjoy the recollection that you have borne unmerited adversity—and I, whilst my pride in undeserved prosperity is punished, shall be taught by my reception here, that when distress presents itself before me, the bitterest drop in the cup of human misery is, the world's contempt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thus you'll deserve your wealth—and when inspir'd by Heav'n to dispense the blessings it has sent you alone for that benign purpose, wait not for the application of modest indlgence—seek her in her sad retreat, cheer her with your smiles, wipe away her tears, comfort and relieve her.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Charles, begin your acts of benevolence by shewing your gratitude to this worthy man, <STAGE>(pointing to Joll.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Joll.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank you, Madam. But as the wind sometimes diverts itself by playing in the sails of my mill, and people will obstinately persist in this odd whim of eating bread, I think I may do pretty well as I am. Ay, we may see the world in our village! But a fig for the world—Let industry secure independence; and if wealth or poverty will come, let the rich man be proud only of his power to be the poor man's friend.</P>

<L>Falls in love with a swain, oh, faugh! in a jacket.</L>
<L>The Lover too, rich, young, without one tonish vice—</L>
<L>No racing, no betting, no intriguing, no dice.</L>
<L>The World in a Village!—I declare I'd as soon</L>

<L>'Tis what Ladies in high life can't afford to do,</L>

<L>Lady Fanny Dawdle, just risen from her down bed,</L>
<L>In the hard talk of nicely blending white and red,</L>
<L>Glancing her languid eyes from the dear glass a minute,</L>

<L>"Yes, my Lady:</L>

<L>"Laying in of twins, Mem, just as he lost his life!"—</L>
<L>"Bless me, Betty, this freckle spoils every feature;</L>
<L>"I'm vastly sorry I can't serve the poor creature:</L>
<L>"I've too much feeling for an income so small—</L>
<L>"Don't forget Lady Froth's ticket for my grand Ball."</L>
<L>Then the men, oh, they are precious niddy noddies,</L>
<L>With their throats tied up, false calves, and taper bodies:</L>
<L>Pert men at seventeen, insolvents at twenty;</L>
<L>At twenty-five, invalids—old men at thirty.</L>
