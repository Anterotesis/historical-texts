When meta∣morphos'd, I may also speak to my lovely Helen, without her knowing who I am; and if I find her not as amiable as she is beautiful, then farewell love! now for my disguise, instead of the young 'squire and lord of the manor, I'm an old, merry, jolly, lying, wicked, mumpping, travelling merchant. <STAGE>(Mimicks)</STAGE> <Q>Sleeve-buttons, shirt-buttons, scissars, threads, tapes and needles, spectacles for all ages! do extend your charity to the poor old man!</Q>— very well! bravo! bravo!</P>

</SP>

<P>Because, mama, so grand! would have me marry a man, only on account of his having come to an immense estate, by the death of an uncle, and this compulsion has given me a great aversion for him.—I hav'n't yet seen him, but have set him down in my fancy, as a puppy.</P>

<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<L>Hence care and strife! nor damp our joy,</L>
<L>Come friendship, mirth and love,</L>
<L>And every sordid, base alloy,</L>
<L>Let's from our bosom move;</L>
<L>For was our gold, but Irish brass,</L>
<L>Good humour's stamp can make it pass;</L>
<L>With a sa, la, la, &amp;c.</L>

<SPEAKER>Felix.</SPEAKER>
<L>To London town our Irish wags,</L>
<L>A fortune hunting run,</L>
<L>And then with heaps of shining bags,</L>
<L>Their paltry souls are won.</L>

<SPEAKER>Helen and Rosa.</SPEAKER>

<L>But till of late, you're such a rook,</L>
<L>You knew not what they meant.</L>
