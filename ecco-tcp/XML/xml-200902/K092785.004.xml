<HEAD>An ELEGY WRITTEN IN A COUNTRY CHURCH YARD.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By Mr. GRAY.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>THE Curfew tolls the knell of parting day,</L>
<L>The lowing herd wind slowly o'er the lea,</L>
<L>The plowman homeward plods his weary way,</L>
<L>And leaves the world to darkness and to me.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,</L>
<L>And all the air a solemn stillness holds,</L>
<L>Save where the beetle wheels his drony flight,</L>
<L>And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Save that from yonder ivy-mantled tow'r</L>
<L>The mopeing owl does to the moon complain</L>
<L>Of such, as wand'ring near her secret bow'r,</L>
<L>Molest her ancient, solitary reign.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Beneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree's shade,</L>
<L>Where heaves the turf in many a mould'ring heap,</L>
<L>Each in his narrow cell for ever laid,</L>
<L>The rude Forefathers of the hamlet sleep,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
<L>The breezy call of incense-breathing Morn,</L>
<L>The swallow twitt'ring from the straw-built shed,</L>
<L>The cock's shrill clarion, or the ecchoing horn,</L>
<L>No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn,</L>
<L>Or busy houswife ply her evening care:</L>
<L>No children run to lisp their sire's return,</L>
<L>Or climb his knees the envied kiss to share.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield,</L>
<L>Their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke;</L>
<L>How jocund did they drive their team afield!</L>
<L>How bow'd the woods beneath their sturdy stroke!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let not Ambition mock their useful toil,</L>
<L>Their homely joys, and destiny obscure;</L>
<L>Nor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile,</L>
<L>The short and simple annals of the poor.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The boast of heraldry, the pomp of pow'r,</L>
<L>And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave,</L>
<L>Await alike th' inevitable hour.</L>
<L>The paths of glory lead but to the grave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor you, ye Proud, impute to These the fault,</L>
<L>If Mem'ry o'er their Tomb no Trophies raise,</L>
<L>Where thro' the long-drawn isle and fretted vault</L>
<L>The pealing anthem swells the note of praise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
<L>Can storied urn or animated bust</L>
<L>Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath?</L>
<L>Can Honour's voice provoke the silent dust,</L>
<L>Or Flatt'ry sooth the dull cold ear of Death?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Perhaps in this neglected spot is laid</L>
<L>Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire;</L>
<L>Hands, that the rod of empire might have sway'd,</L>
<L>Or wak'd to extasy the living lyre.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But Knowledge to their eyes her ample page</L>
<L>Rich with the spoils of time did ne'er unroll;</L>
<L>Chill Penury repress'd their noble rage,</L>
<L>And froze the genial current of the soul.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Full many a gem of purest ray serene,</L>
<L>The dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear;</L>
<L>Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,</L>
<L>And waste its sweetness on the desert air.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some village-Hampden, that with dauntless breast</L>
<L>The little Tyrant of his fields withstood;</L>
<L>Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest,</L>
<L>Some Cromwell guiltless of his country's blood.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Th' applause of list'ning senates to command,</L>
<L>The threats of pain and ruin to despise,</L>
<L>To scatter plenty o'er a smiling land,</L>
<L>And read their hist'ry in a nation's eyes</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
<L>Their lot forbad: nor circumscrib'd alone</L>
<L>Their growing virtues, but their crimes consin'd;</L>
<L>Forbad to wade through slaughter to a throne,</L>
<L>And shut the gates of mercy on mankind,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide,</L>
<L>To quench the blushes of ingenuous shame,</L>
<L>Or heap the shrine of Luxury and Pride</L>
<L>With incense kindled at the Muse's flame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife,</L>
<L>Their sober wishes never learn'd to stray;</L>
<L>Along the cool sequester'd vale of life</L>
<L>They kept the noiseless tenor of their way.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet ev'n these bones from insult to protect</L>
<L>Some frail memorial still erected nigh,</L>
<L>With uncouth rhimes and shapeless sculpture deck'd,</L>
<L>Implores the passing tribute of a sigh.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Their name, their years, spelt by th' unletter'd Muse,</L>
<L>The place of fame and elegy supply:</L>
<L>And many a holy text around she strews,</L>
<L>That teach the rustic moralist to dye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For who to dumb Forgetfulness a prey,</L>
<L>This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd,</L>
<L>Left the warm precincts of the chearful day,</L>
<L>Nor cast one longing ling'ring look behind?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
<L>On some fond breast the parting soul relies,</L>
<L>Some pious drops the closing eye requires;</L>
<L>Ev'n from the tomb the voice of Nature cries,</L>
<L>Ev'n in our Ashes live their wonted Fires.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For thee, who mindful of th' unhonour'd Dead</L>
<L>Dost in these lines their artless tale relate;</L>
<L>If chance, by lonely Contemplation led,</L>
<L>Some kindred Spirit shall inquire thy fate,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Haply some hoary-headed Swain may say,</L>
<L>'Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn</L>
<L>'Brushing with hasty steps the dews away</L>
<L>'To meet the sun upon the upland lawn.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'There at the foot of yonder nodding beech</L>
<L>'That wreathes its old fantastic roots so high,</L>
<L>'His listless length at noon-tide wou'd he stretch,</L>
<L>'And pore upon the brook that babbles by.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,</L>
<L>'Mutt'ring his wayward sancies he wou'd rove;</L>
<L>'Now drooping, woeful wan, like one forlorn,</L>
<L>'Or craz'd with care, or cross'd in hopeless love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'One morn I miss'd him on the custom'd hill,</L>
<L>'Along the heath and near his fav'rite tree:</L>
<L>'Another came; nor yet beside the rill,</L>
<L>'Nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
<L>'The next with dirges due in sad array</L>
<L>'Slow through the church-way path we saw him born,</L>

<L>HERE rests his head upon the lap of Earth</L>
<L>A Youth to Fortune and to Fame unknown,</L>

<L>Large was his bounty; and his soul sincere,</L>

To those, who may happen not to have seen this repository of <HI>British</HI> glory, I cannot give a better idea of it, than in the following lines of <HI>Virgil:</HI><Q><L>Hic manus <HI>ob patriam pugnando</HI> vulnera passi;</L>

<L>The day that shone on Sidney's birth.</L>
<L>That happy time, that glorious day</L>
<L>The Muses came in concert gay;</L>
<L>With harps in tune, and ready song,</L>
<L>The jolly Chorus tript along;</L>
<L>In honour of th' auspicious morn,</L>
<L>To hail an infant genius born:</L>
<L>Next came the Fauns in order meet,</L>
<L>The Satyrs next with cloven feet,</L>
<L>The Dryads swift that roam the woods,</L>
<L>The Naiads green that swim the floods;</L>
<L>Sylvanus left his silent cave,</L>
<L>Medway came dropping from the wave;</L>
<L>Vertumnus led his blushing spouse,</L>
<L>And Ceres shook her wheaten brows,</L>

<L>Thus let my feet unwearied stray;</L>

<L>And at the gate of heaven sings.</L>

<L>But when the sun with fervid ray</L>
<L>Drives upwards to his noon of day,</L>

<L>Where Beauty smiles serenely fair,</L>
<L>And Courage frowns with martial air;</L>

<L>O Say, thou dear possessor of my breast,</L>

<L>Where the gay moments which I once have known,</L>
<L>O where that heart I fondly thought my own!</L>
<L>From place to place I solitary roam,</L>
<L>Abroad uneasy, nor content at home.</L>
<L>I scorn the beauties common eyes adore,</L>
<L>The more I view them, feel thy worth the more;</L>
<L>Unmov'd I hear them speak, or see them fair,</L>

<L>In vain would books their formal succour lend,</L>

<L>In vain to tell thee all I write in vain;</L>
<L>My humble sighs shall only reach thy ears,</L>
<L>And all my eloquence shall be my tears.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now (for more I never must pretend)</L>
<L>Hear me not as thy lover, but thy friend;</L>
<L>Thousands will fain thy little heart ensnare,</L>
<L>For without danger none like thee are fair;</L>
<L>But wisely chuse who best deserves thy flame,</L>
<L>So shall the choice itself become thy fame;</L>
<L>Nor yet despise, tho' void of winning art,</L>
<L>The plain and honest courtship of the heart:</L>
<L>The skilful tongue in love's persuasive lore,</L>
<L>Tho' less it feels, will please and flatter more,</L>

And since their lips, so knowing to deceive,</L>

<HEAD>FLORA to POMPEY.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By the Same.</BYLINE>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Pompey,</HI> when he was very young, fell in love with <HI>Flora,</HI> a <HI>Roman</HI> courtezan, who was so very beautiful that the <HI>Romans</HI> had her painted to adorn the temple of <HI>Castor</HI> and <HI>Pollux. Geminius</HI> (<HI>Pompey</HI>'s friend) afterwards fell in love with her too; but she, prepossessed with a pas∣sion for <HI>Pompey,</HI> would not listen to <HI>Geminius. Pompey,</HI> in compassion to his friend, yielded him his mistress, which <HI>Flora</HI> took so much to heart, that she fell dangerously ill upon it; and in that sickness is supposed to write the fol∣lowing letter to <HI>Pompey.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<LG>
<L>ERE death these closing eyes for ever shade,</L>
<L>(That death thy cruelties have welcome made)</L>
<L>Receive, thou yet lov'd man! this one adieu,</L>
<L>This last farewel to happiness and you.</L>
<L>My eyes o'erflow with tears, my trembling hand</L>
<L>Can scarce the letters form, or pen command:</L>
<L>The dancing paper swims before my sight,</L>
<L>And scarce myself can read the words I write.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Think you behold me in this lost estate,</L>
<L>And think yourself the author of my fate:</L>
<L>How vast the change! your Flora's now become</L>
<L>The gen'ral pity, not the boast of Rome.</L>
<L>This form, a pattern to the sculptor's art,</L>
<L>This face, the idol once of Pompey's heart,</L>
<L><PB N="91" REF="93"/>
(Whose pictur'd beauties Rome thought fit to place</L>
<L>The sacred temples of her gods to grace)</L>
<L>Are charming now no more; the bloom is fled,</L>
<L>The lillies languid, and the roses dead.</L>
<L>Soon shall some hand the glorious work deface,</L>
<L>Where Grecian pencils tell what Flora was:</L>
<L>No longer my resemblance they impart,</L>
<L>They lost their likeness, when I lost thy heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh! that those hours could take their turn again,</L>
<L>When Pompey, lab'ring with a jealous pain,</L>
<L>His Flora thus bespoke: "Say, my dear love!</L>
<L>"Shall all these rivals unsuccessful prove?</L>
<L>"In vain, for ever, shall the Roman youth</L>
<L>"Envy my happiness, and tempt thy truth?</L>
<L>"Shall neither tears nor pray'rs thy pity move?</L>
<L>"Ah! give not pity, 'tis akin to love.</L>
<L>"Would Flora were not fair in such excess,</L>
<L>"That I might fear, tho' not adore her less."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fool that I was, I sought to ease that grief,</L>
<L>Nor knew indiff'rence follow'd the relief:</L>

<L>I never dreaded, till I found my fate.</L>
<L>'Twas mine to ask if Pompey's self could hear,</L>
<L>Unmov'd, his rivals unsuccessful pray'r;</L>
<L>To make thee swear he'd not thy pity move;</L>
<L>Alas! such pity is no kin to love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Twas thou thyself (ungrateful as thou art!)</L>
<L>Bade me unbend the rigour of my heart:</L>
<L><PB N="92" REF="94"/>
You chid my faith, reproach'd my being true,</L>
<L>(Unnat'ral thought!) and labour'd to subdue</L>
<L>The constancy my soul maintain'd for you;</L>
<L>To other arms your mistress you condemn'd,</L>
<L>Too cool a lover, and too warm a friend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How could'st thou thus my lavish heart abuse,</L>
<L>To ask the only thing it could refuse?</L>
<L>Nor yet upbraid me, Pompey, what I say,</L>
<L>For 'tis my merit that I can't obey;</L>
<L>Yet this alledg'd against me as a fault,</L>
<L>Thy rage fomented, and my ruin wrought.</L>
<L>Just gods! what tye, what conduct can prevail</L>
<L>O'er fickle man, when truth like mine can fail?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Urge not, to gloss thy crime, the name of friend,</L>
<L>We know how far those sacred laws extend;</L>
<L>Since other heroes have not blush'd to prove</L>
<L>How weak all passions when oppos'd to love:</L>
<L>Nor boast the virtuous conflict of thy heart,</L>
<L>When gen'rous pity took Geminius' part;</L>
<L>'Tis all heroic fraud, and Roman art.</L>
<L>Such flights of honour might amuse the crowd,</L>
<L>But by a mistress ne'er can be allow'd;</L>
<L>Keep for the senate, and the grave debate,</L>
<L>That infamous hypocrisy of state;</L>
<L>There words are virtue, and your trade deceit.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No riddle is thy change, nor hard t' explain;</L>
<L>Flora was fond, and Pompey was a man:</L>
<L><PB N="93" REF="95"/>
No longer then a specious tale pretend,</L>
<L>Nor plead fictitious merit to your friend:</L>
<L>By nature false, you follow'd her decree,</L>
<L>Nor gen'rous are to him, but false to me.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>You say you melted at Geminius' tears,</L>
<L>You say you felt his agonizing cares:</L>
<L>Gross artifice, that this from him could move,</L>
<L>And not from Flora, whom you say you love:</L>
<L>You could not bear to hear your rival sigh,</L>
<L>Yet bear unmov'd to see your mistress die.</L>
<L>Inhuman hypocrite! not thus can he</L>
<L>My wrongs, and my distress, obdurate, see.</L>
<L>He, who receiv'd, condemns the gift you made,</L>
<L>And joins with me the giver to upbraid,</L>
<L>Forgetting he's oblig'd, and mourning I'm betray'd.</L>
<L>He loves too well that cruel gift to use,</L>
<L>Which Pompey lov'd too little to refuse:</L>
<L>Fain would he call my vagrant lord again,</L>
<L>But I the kind embassador restrain;</L>
<L>I scorn to let another take my part,</L>
<L>And to myself will owe or lose thy heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Can nothing e'er rekindle love in thee?</L>
<L>Can nothing e'er extinguish it in me?</L>
<L>That I could tear thee from this injur'd breast!</L>
<L>And where you gave my person, give the rest,</L>
<L>At once to grant and punish thy request.</L>
<L>That I could place thy worthy rival there!</L>
<L>No second insult need my fondness fear;</L>
<L><PB N="94" REF="96"/>
He views not Flora with her Pompey's eyes,</L>
<L>He loves like me, he doats, despairs, and dies.</L>

<L>Come to my arms, thou dear, deserving youth!</L>
<L>Thou prodigy of man! thou man with truth!</L>
<L>For him, I will redouble every care,</L>
<L>To please, for him, these faded charms repair;</L>
<L>To crown his vows, and sharpen thy despair.</L>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Roxana,</HI> one of <HI>Usbeck</HI>'s wives, was found (whilst he was in <HI>Europe</HI>) in bed with her lover, whom she had privately let into the seraglio. The guardian eunuch who discovered them, had the man murdered on the spot, and her close guarded till he received instructions from his master how to dispose of her. During that interval she swallowed poyson, and is supposed to write the following letter whilst she is dying.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<LG>
<L>THINK not I write my innocence to prove,</L>
<L>To sue for pity, or awake thy love:</L>
<L>No mean defence expect, or abject pray'rs;</L>
<L>Thou know'st no mercy, and I know no tears:</L>
<L>I laugh at all thy vengeance has decreed,</L>
<L>Avow the fact, and glory in the deed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yes, tyrant! I deceiv'd thy spies and thee;</L>
<L>Pleas'd in oppression, and in bondage free:</L>
<L>The rigid agents of thy cruel laws</L>
<L>By gold I won to aid my juster cause:</L>
<L>With dextrous skill eluded all thy care,</L>
<L>And acted more than jealousy could fear:</L>
<L>To wanton bow'rs this prison-house I turn'd,</L>
<L>And bless'd that absence which you thought I mourn'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="103" REF="105"/>
<L>But short those joys allow'd by niggard Fate,</L>
<L>Yet so refin'd, so exquisitely great,</L>
<L>That their excess compensated their date.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I die: already in each burning vein</L>
<L>I feel the poys'nous draught, and bless the pain:</L>
<L>For what is life unless its joys we prove?</L>
<L>And where is joy depriv'd of what we love?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet, ere I die, this justice I have paid</L>
<L>To my dear murder'd lover's injur'd shade:</L>
<L>Those sacrilegious instruments of power,</L>
<L>Who wrought that ruin these sad eyes deplore,</L>
<L>Already with their blood their crimes attone,</L>
<L>And for his life have sacrific'd their own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thee, tho' restraint and absence may defend</L>
<L>From my revenge, my curses still attend:</L>
<L>Despair like mine, barbarian! be thy part,</L>
<L>Remorse afflict, and sorrow sting thy heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor think this hate commencing in my breast,</L>
<L>Tho' prudence long its latent force suppress'd;</L>
<L>I knew those wrongs that I was forc'd to bear,</L>
<L>And curs'd those chains Injustice made me wear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For could'st thou hope Roxana to deceive</L>
<L>With idle tales, which only fools believe?</L>
<L>Poor abject souls in superstition bred,</L>
<L>In ign'rance train'd, by prejudice misled;</L>
<L>Whom hireling dervises by proxy teach</L>
<L>From those whose false prerogative they preach.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="104" REF="106"/>
<L>Didst thou imagine me so weak of mind,</L>
<L>Because I murmur'd not, I ne'er repin'd,</L>
<L>But hugg'd my chain, and thought my jaylor kind?</L>
<L>That willingly those laws I e'er obey'd,</L>
<L>Which Pride invented, and Oppression made?</L>
<L>And whilst self-licens'd through the world you rove,</L>
<L>To quicken appetite by change in love;</L>
<L>Each passion sated, and each wish possess'd,</L>
<L>That Lust can urge, or Fancy can suggest;</L>
<L>That I should mourn thy loss with fond regret,</L>
<L>Weep the misfortune, and the wrong forget?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Could I believe that heav'n this beauty gave,</L>
<L>(Thy transient pleasure, and thy lasting flave;)</L>
<L>Indu'd with reason, only to fulfil</L>
<L>The harsh commands of thy capricious will?</L>
<L>No, Usbeck, no, my soul difdain'd those laws;</L>
<L>And tho' I wanted pow'r t' assert my cause,</L>
<L>My right I knew; and still those pleasures sought,</L>
<L>Which Justice warranted, and Nature taught:</L>
<L>On Custom's senfeless precepts I refin'd,</L>
<L>I weigh'd what heav'n, I knew what man design'd,</L>
<L>And form'd by her own rules my free-born mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus whilst this wretched body own'd thy pow'r,</L>
<L>Doom'd, unredress'd, its hardships to deplore;</L>
<L>My soul subservient to herself alone,</L>
<L>And Reason independent on her throne,</L>
<L>Contemn'd thy dictates, and obey'd their own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="105" REF="107"/>
<L>Yet thus far to my conduct thanks are due,</L>
<L>At least I condescended to seem true;</L>
<L>Endeavour'd still my sentiments to hide,</L>
<L>Indulg'd thy vanity, and sooth'd thy pride.</L>
<L>Tho' this submission to a tyrant paid,</L>
<L>Whom not my duty, but my fears obey'd,</L>
<L>If rightly weigh'd, would more deserve thy blame,</L>
<L>Who call it Virtue, but prophane her name:</L>
<L>For to the world I should have own'd that love,</L>
<L>Which all impartial judges must approve:</L>
<L>You urg'd a right to tyrannize my heart,</L>
<L>Which he solliciting, assail'd by art,</L>
<L>Whilst I, impatient of the name of slave,</L>
<L>To force refus'd, what I to merit gave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oft, as thy slaves this wretched body led</L>
<L>To the detested pleasures of thy bed;</L>
<L>In those soft moments, consecrate to joy,</L>
<L>Which extacy and transport should employ;</L>
<L>Clasp'd in your arms, you wonder'd still to find</L>
<L>So cold my kisses, so compos'd my mind:</L>
<L>But had thy cheated eyes discern'd aright,</L>
<L>You'd found aversion, where you sought delight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not that my soul incapable of love,</L>
<L>No charms could warm, no tenderness could move;</L>
<L>For him, whose love my ev'ry thought possess'd,</L>
<L>A fiercer passion fill'd this constant breast,</L>
<L>Than truth e'er felt, or falshood e'er profess'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="106" REF="108"/>
<L>This stile unusual to thy pride appears,</L>
<L>For truth's a stranger to the tyrant's ears;</L>
<L>But what have I to manage or to dread?</L>
<L>Nor threats alarm, nor insults hurt the dead:</L>
<L>No wrongs they feel, no miseries they find;</L>
<L>Cares are the legacies we leave behind:</L>
<L>In the calm grave no Usbecks we deplore,</L>
<L>No tyrant husband, no oppressive pow'r.</L>
<L>Alas! I faint—Death intercepts the rest:</L>
<L>The venom'd drug is busy in my breast:</L>
<L>Each nerve's unstrung: a mist obscures the day:</L>
<L>My senses, strength, and ev'n my hate decay:</L>
<L>Tho' rage a while the ebbing spirits stay'd,</L>
<L>'Tis past—they sink beneath the transient aid.</L>
<L>Take then, inhuman wretch! my last farewel;</L>
<L>Pain be thy portion here, hereafter, hell:</L>

<L>HARD is the heart that never knew to love,</L>

<L>With heavy heart, and full of cark I go</L>

<L>And many a fair Narcissus deck'd the plain,</L>

<L>And drifting hail descend; or if the skies</L>

<L>Raptur'd thou sit'st, while murmurs indistinct</L>

<L>With hoarse and hollow sounds; secure, self-blest,</L>
<L>There oft thou listen'st to the wild uproar</L>

<L>Ascends the rocky summit, where thou dwell'st</L>

<L>O lead me, queen sublime, to solemn glooms</L>
<L>Congenial with my soul; to chearless shades,</L>
<L><PB N="215" REF="217"/>
To ruin'd seats, to twilight cells and bow'rs,</L>
<L>Where thoughtful Melancholy loves to muse,</L>
<L>Her fav'rite midnight haunts. The laughing scenes</L>
<L>Of purple Spring, where all the wanton train</L>
<L>Of Smiles and Graces seem to lead the dance</L>

<L>While sullen sacred silence reigns around,</L>
<L>Save the lone screech-owl's note, who builds his bow'r</L>
<L>Amid the mould'ring caverns dark and damp,</L>
<L>Or the calm breeze, that rustles in the leaves</L>
<L>Of flaunting ivy, that with mantle green</L>

<L>'Mid hollow charnel let me watch the flame</L>
<L>Of taper dim, shedding a livid glare</L>
<L>O'er the wan heaps; while airy voices talk</L>
<L><PB N="216" REF="218"/>
Along the glimm'ring walls; or ghostly shape</L>
<L>At distance seen, invites with beck'ning hand</L>
<L>My lonesome steps, thro' the far-winding vaults.</L>
<L>Nor undelightful is the solemn noon</L>
<L>Of night, when haply wakeful from my couch</L>

<L>Roars not the rushing wind; the sons of men</L>
<L>And every beast in mute oblivion lie;</L>
<L>All nature's hush'd in silence and in sleep.</L>

<L>That thro' the still globe's aweful solitude,</L>
<L>No being wakes but me! 'till stealing sleep</L>
<L>My drooping temples bathes in opiate dews.</L>
<L>Nor then let dreams, of wanton folly born,</L>
<L>My senses lead thro' flowery paths of joy;</L>
<L>But let the sacred Genius of the night</L>
<L>Such mystic visions send, as Spenser saw,</L>
<L>When thro' bewild'ring Fancy's magic maze,</L>
<L>To the fell house of Busyrane, he led</L>

<L><PB N="217" REF="219"/>
Where thro' the room a blindly-glimm'ring gleam</L>
<L>The dying embers scatter, far remote</L>
<L>From Mirth's mad shouts, that thro' th' illumin'd roof</L>
<L>Resound with festive echo, let me sit,</L>
<L>Blest with the lowly cricket's drowsy dirge.</L>
<L>Then let my thought contemplative explore</L>
<L>This fleeting state of things, the vain delights,</L>
<L>The fruitless toils, that still our search elude,</L>
<L>As thro' the wilderness of life we rove.</L>
<L>This sober hour of silence will unmask</L>
<L>False Folly's smile, that like the dazzling spells</L>
<L>Of wily Comus cheat th' unweeting eye</L>
<L>With blear illusion, and persuade to drink</L>
<L>That charmed cup, which Reason's mintage fair</L>

<L>DEAR Chloe, while the busy croud,</L>
<L>The vain, the wealthy, and the proud,</L>
<L>In Folly's maze advance;</L>

<L>From the gay world we'll oft retire</L>

<L>Of rest was Noah's dove bereft,</L>
<L>When with impatient wing she left</L>

<L>A paradise below.</L>

<L>Our babes shall richest comforts bring,</L>
<L>If tutor'd right, they'll prove a spring,</L>

<L>Nor grudge our sons with envious eyes,</L>
<L>The relicks of our store.</L>

<L>Thus hand in hand thro' life we'll go,</L>

<P>THE humble Petition of the worshipful company of Poets and News-writers,</P>

<L>THAT your honour's petitioners (dealers in rhymes,</L>

<L>And want of materials to carry on trade.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That they always had form'd high conceits of their use,</L>
<L>And meant their last breath shou'd go out in abuse;</L>
<L>But now (and they speak it with sorrow and tears)</L>
<L>Since your honour has sate at the helm of affairs,</L>
<L>No party will join 'em, no faction invite</L>
<L>To heed what they say, or to read what they write;</L>
<L>Sedition, and Tumult, and Discord are fled,</L>
<L>And Slander scarce ventures to lift up her head—</L>

<L>To perplex 'em still more, and sure famine to bring</L>
<L>(Now satire has lost both its truth and its sting)</L>
<L>If, in spite of their natures, they bungle at praise,</L>
<L>Your honour regards not, and nobody pays.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>YOUR Petitioners therefore most humbly entreat</L>
<L>(As the times will allow, and your honour thinks meet)</L>
<L>That measures be chang'd, and some cause of complaint</L>
<L>Be immediately furnish'd, to end their restraint;</L>
<L>Their credit thereby, and their trade to retrieve,</L>

<L>Or else (if your wisdom shall deem it all one)</L>
<L>Now the parliament's rising, and bus'ness is done,</L>
<L>That your honour would please, at this dangerous crisis,</L>

<L>By which your petitioners, haply, might thrive,</L>
